the, periodic, table, also, known, as, the, periodic, table, of, the, elements, is, an, ordered, arrangement, of, the, chemical, elements, into, rows, periods, and, columns, groups, it, is, an, icon, of, chemistry, and, is, widely, used, in, physics, and, other, sciences, it, is, a, depiction, of, the, periodic, law, which, states, that, when, the, elements, are, arranged, in, order, of, their, atomic, numbers, an, approximate, recurrence, of, their, properties, is, evident, the, table, is, divided, into, four, roughly, rectangular, areas, called, blocks, elements, in, the, same, group, tend, to, show, similar, chemical, characteristics, vertical, horizontal, and, diagonal, trends, characterize, the, periodic, table, metallic, character, increases, going, down, a, group, and, from, right, to, left, across, a, period, nonmetallic, character, increases, going, from, the, bottom, left, of, the, periodic, table, to, the, top, right, the, first, periodic, table, to, become, generally, accepted, was, that, of, the, russian, chemist, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1869, he, formulated, the, periodic, law, as, a, dependence, of, chemical, properties, on, atomic, mass, as, not, all, elements, were, then, known, there, were, gaps, in, his, periodic, table, and, mendeleev, successfully, used, the, periodic, law, to, predict, some, properties, of, some, of, the, missing, elements, the, periodic, law, was, recognized, as, a, fundamental, discovery, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, explained, early, in, the, 20th, century, with, the, discovery, of, atomic, numbers, and, associated, pioneering, work, in, quantum, mechanics, both, ideas, serving, to, illuminate, the, internal, structure, of, the, atom, a, recognisably, modern, form, of, the, table, was, reached, in, 1945, with, glenn, t, seaborg, s, discovery, that, the, actinides, were, in, fact, f, block, rather, than, d, block, elements, the, periodic, table, and, law, are, now, a, central, and, indispensable, part, of, modern, chemistry, the, periodic, table, continues, to, evolve, with, the, progress, of, science, in, nature, only, elements, up, to, atomic, number, 94, exist, to, go, further, it, was, necessary, to, synthesize, new, elements, in, the, laboratory, by, 2010, the, first, 118, elements, were, known, thereby, completing, the, first, seven, rows, of, the, table, however, chemical, characterization, is, still, needed, for, the, heaviest, elements, to, confirm, that, their, properties, match, their, positions, new, discoveries, will, extend, the, table, beyond, these, seven, rows, though, it, is, not, yet, known, how, many, more, elements, are, possible, moreover, theoretical, calculations, suggest, that, this, unknown, region, will, not, follow, the, patterns, of, the, known, part, of, the, table, some, scientific, discussion, also, continues, regarding, whether, some, elements, are, correctly, positioned, in, today, s, table, many, alternative, representations, of, the, periodic, law, exist, and, there, is, some, discussion, as, to, whether, there, is, an, optimal, form, of, the, periodic, table, 1, each, chemical, element, has, a, unique, atomic, number, z, representing, the, number, of, protons, in, its, nucleus, all, elements, have, multiple, isotopes, variants, with, the, same, number, of, protons, but, different, numbers, of, neutrons, for, example, carbon, has, three, naturally, occurring, isotopes, all, of, its, atoms, have, six, protons, and, most, have, six, neutrons, as, well, but, about, one, per, cent, have, seven, neutrons, and, a, very, small, fraction, have, eight, neutrons, isotopes, are, never, separated, in, the, periodic, table, they, are, always, grouped, together, under, a, single, element, when, atomic, mass, is, shown, it, is, usually, the, weighted, average, of, naturally, occurring, isotopes, but, if, no, isotopes, occur, naturally, in, significant, quantities, the, mass, of, the, most, stable, isotope, usually, appears, often, in, parentheses, in, the, standard, periodic, table, the, elements, are, listed, in, order, of, increasing, atomic, number, z, a, new, row, period, is, started, when, a, new, electron, shell, has, its, first, electron, columns, groups, are, determined, by, the, electron, configuration, of, the, atom, elements, with, the, same, number, of, electrons, in, a, particular, subshell, fall, into, the, same, columns, e, g, oxygen, sulfur, and, selenium, are, in, the, same, column, because, they, all, have, four, electrons, in, the, outermost, p, subshell, elements, with, similar, chemical, properties, generally, fall, into, the, same, group, in, the, periodic, table, although, in, the, f, block, and, to, some, respect, in, the, d, block, the, elements, in, the, same, period, tend, to, have, similar, properties, as, well, thus, it, is, relatively, easy, to, predict, the, chemical, properties, of, an, element, if, one, knows, the, properties, of, the, elements, around, it, the, first, 94, elements, occur, naturally, the, remaining, 24, americium, to, oganesson, 95, 118, occur, only, when, synthesized, in, laboratories, of, the, 94, naturally, occurring, elements, 83, are, primordial, and, 11, occur, only, in, decay, chains, of, primordial, elements, a, few, of, the, latter, are, so, rare, that, they, were, not, discovered, in, nature, but, were, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, before, it, was, determined, that, they, do, exist, in, nature, after, all, technetium, element, 43, promethium, element, 61, astatine, element, 85, neptunium, element, 93, and, plutonium, element, 94, no, element, heavier, than, einsteinium, element, 99, has, ever, been, observed, in, macroscopic, quantities, in, its, pure, form, nor, has, astatine, francium, element, 87, has, been, only, photographed, in, the, form, of, light, emitted, from, microscopic, quantities, 300, 000, atoms, under, an, international, naming, convention, the, groups, are, numbered, numerically, from, 1, to, 18, from, the, leftmost, column, the, alkali, metals, to, the, rightmost, column, the, noble, gases, the, f, block, groups, are, ignored, in, this, numbering, groups, can, also, be, named, by, their, first, element, e, g, the, scandium, group, for, group, 3, previously, groups, were, known, by, roman, numerals, in, the, united, states, the, roman, numerals, were, followed, by, either, an, a, if, the, group, was, in, the, s, or, p, block, or, a, b, if, the, group, was, in, the, d, block, the, roman, numerals, used, correspond, to, the, last, digit, of, today, s, naming, convention, e, g, the, group, 4, elements, were, group, ivb, and, the, group, 14, elements, were, group, iva, in, europe, the, lettering, was, similar, except, that, a, was, used, for, groups, 1, through, 7, and, b, was, used, for, groups, 11, through, 17, in, addition, groups, 8, 9, and, 10, used, to, be, treated, as, one, triple, sized, group, known, collectively, in, both, notations, as, group, viii, in, 1988, the, new, iupac, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, naming, system, 1, 18, was, put, into, use, and, the, old, group, names, i, viii, were, deprecated, 32, columns, 18, columns, for, reasons, of, space, the, periodic, table, is, commonly, presented, with, the, f, block, elements, cut, out, and, positioned, as, a, distinct, part, below, the, main, body, this, reduces, the, number, of, element, columns, from, 32, to, 18, both, forms, represent, the, same, periodic, table, the, form, with, the, f, block, included, in, the, main, body, is, sometimes, called, the, 32, column, or, long, form, the, form, with, the, f, block, cut, out, the, 18, column, or, medium, long, form, the, 32, column, form, has, the, advantage, of, showing, all, elements, in, their, correct, sequence, but, it, has, the, disadvantage, of, requiring, more, space, the, form, chosen, is, an, editorial, choice, and, does, not, imply, any, change, of, scientific, claim, or, statement, for, example, when, discussing, the, composition, of, group, 3, the, options, can, be, shown, equally, unprejudiced, in, both, forms, periodic, tables, usually, at, least, show, the, elements, symbols, many, also, provide, supplementary, information, about, the, elements, either, via, colour, coding, or, as, data, in, the, cells, the, above, table, shows, the, names, and, atomic, numbers, of, the, elements, and, also, their, blocks, natural, occurrences, and, standard, atomic, weights, for, the, short, lived, elements, without, standard, atomic, weights, the, mass, number, of, the, most, stable, known, isotope, is, used, instead, other, tables, may, include, properties, such, as, state, of, matter, melting, and, boiling, points, densities, as, well, as, provide, different, classifications, of, the, elements, the, smallest, constituents, of, all, normal, matter, are, known, as, atoms, atoms, are, extremely, small, being, about, one, ten, billionth, of, a, meter, across, thus, their, internal, structure, is, governed, by, quantum, mechanics, atoms, consist, of, a, small, positively, charged, nucleus, made, of, positively, charged, protons, and, uncharged, neutrons, surrounded, by, a, cloud, of, negatively, charged, electrons, the, charges, cancel, out, so, atoms, are, neutral, electrons, participate, in, chemical, reactions, but, the, nucleus, does, not, when, atoms, participate, in, chemical, reactions, they, either, gain, or, lose, electrons, to, form, positively, or, negatively, charged, ions, or, share, electrons, with, each, other, atoms, can, be, subdivided, into, different, types, based, on, the, number, of, protons, and, thus, also, electrons, they, have, this, is, called, the, atomic, number, often, symbolized, z, for, zahl, german, for, number, each, distinct, atomic, number, therefore, corresponds, to, a, class, of, atom, these, classes, are, called, the, chemical, elements, the, chemical, elements, are, what, the, periodic, table, classifies, and, organizes, hydrogen, is, the, element, with, atomic, number, 1, helium, atomic, number, 2, lithium, atomic, number, 3, and, so, on, each, of, these, names, can, be, further, abbreviated, by, a, one, or, two, letter, chemical, symbol, those, for, hydrogen, helium, and, lithium, are, respectively, h, he, and, li, neutrons, do, not, affect, the, atom, s, chemical, identity, but, do, affect, its, weight, atoms, with, the, same, number, of, protons, but, different, numbers, of, neutrons, are, called, isotopes, of, the, same, chemical, element, naturally, occurring, elements, usually, occur, as, mixes, of, different, isotopes, since, each, isotope, usually, occurs, with, a, characteristic, abundance, naturally, occurring, elements, have, well, defined, atomic, weights, defined, as, the, average, mass, of, a, naturally, occurring, atom, of, that, element, today, 118, elements, are, known, the, first, 94, of, which, are, known, to, occur, naturally, on, earth, at, present, of, the, 94, natural, elements, eighty, have, a, stable, isotope, and, one, more, bismuth, has, an, almost, stable, isotope, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 01, 10, 19, years, over, a, billion, times, the, age, of, the, universe, two, more, thorium, and, uranium, have, isotopes, undergoing, radioactive, decay, with, a, half, life, comparable, to, the, age, of, the, earth, the, stable, elements, plus, bismuth, thorium, and, uranium, make, up, the, 83, primordial, elements, that, survived, from, the, earth, s, formation, the, remaining, eleven, natural, elements, decay, quickly, enough, that, their, continued, trace, occurrence, rests, primarily, on, being, constantly, regenerated, as, intermediate, products, of, the, decay, of, thorium, and, uranium, all, 24, known, artificial, elements, are, radioactive, the, periodic, table, is, a, graphic, description, of, the, periodic, law, which, states, that, the, properties, and, atomic, structures, of, the, chemical, elements, are, a, periodic, function, of, their, atomic, number, elements, are, placed, in, the, periodic, table, according, to, their, electron, configurations, the, periodic, recurrences, of, which, explain, the, trends, in, properties, across, the, periodic, table, an, electron, can, be, thought, of, as, inhabiting, an, atomic, orbital, which, characterizes, the, probability, it, can, be, found, in, any, particular, region, around, the, atom, their, energies, are, quantised, which, is, to, say, that, they, can, only, take, discrete, values, furthermore, electrons, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, different, electrons, must, always, be, in, different, states, this, allows, classification, of, the, possible, states, an, electron, can, take, in, various, energy, levels, known, as, shells, divided, into, individual, subshells, which, each, contain, one, or, more, orbitals, each, orbital, can, contain, up, to, two, electrons, they, are, distinguished, by, a, quantity, known, as, spin, conventionally, labelled, up, or, down, in, a, cold, atom, one, in, its, ground, state, electrons, arrange, themselves, in, such, a, way, that, the, total, energy, they, have, is, minimized, by, occupying, the, lowest, energy, orbitals, available, only, the, outermost, electrons, so, called, valence, electrons, have, enough, energy, to, break, free, of, the, nucleus, and, participate, in, chemical, reactions, with, other, atoms, the, others, are, called, core, electrons, elements, are, known, with, up, to, the, first, seven, shells, occupied, the, first, shell, contains, only, one, orbital, a, spherical, s, orbital, as, it, is, in, the, first, shell, this, is, called, the, 1s, orbital, this, can, hold, up, to, two, electrons, the, second, shell, similarly, contains, a, 2s, orbital, and, it, also, contains, three, dumbbell, shaped, 2p, orbitals, and, can, thus, fill, up, to, eight, electrons, 2, 1, 2, 3, 8, the, third, shell, contains, one, 3s, orbital, three, 3p, orbitals, and, five, 3d, orbitals, and, thus, has, a, capacity, of, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 18, the, fourth, shell, contains, one, 4s, orbital, three, 4p, orbitals, five, 4d, orbitals, and, seven, 4f, orbitals, thus, leading, to, a, capacity, of, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 32, higher, shells, contain, more, types, of, orbitals, that, continue, the, pattern, but, such, types, of, orbitals, are, not, filled, in, the, ground, states, of, known, elements, the, subshell, types, are, characterized, by, the, quantum, numbers, four, numbers, describe, an, orbital, in, an, atom, completely, the, principal, quantum, number, n, the, azimuthal, quantum, number, the, orbital, type, the, orbital, magnetic, quantum, number, m, and, the, spin, magnetic, quantum, number, m, s, the, sequence, in, which, the, subshells, are, filled, is, given, in, most, cases, by, the, aufbau, principle, also, known, as, the, madelung, or, klechkovsky, rule, after, erwin, madelung, and, vsevolod, klechkovsky, respectively, this, rule, was, first, observed, empirically, by, madelung, and, klechkovsky, and, later, authors, gave, it, theoretical, justification, the, shells, overlap, in, energies, and, the, madelung, rule, specifies, the, sequence, of, filling, according, to, here, the, sign, means, much, less, than, as, opposed, to, meaning, just, less, than, phrased, differently, electrons, enter, orbitals, in, order, of, increasing, n, and, if, two, orbitals, are, available, with, the, same, value, of, n, the, one, with, lower, n, is, occupied, first, in, general, orbitals, with, the, same, value, of, n, are, similar, in, energy, but, in, the, case, of, the, s, orbitals, with, 0, quantum, effects, raise, their, energy, to, approach, that, of, the, next, n, group, hence, the, periodic, table, is, usually, drawn, to, begin, each, row, often, called, a, period, with, the, filling, of, a, new, s, orbital, which, corresponds, to, the, beginning, of, a, new, shell, thus, with, the, exception, of, the, first, row, each, period, length, appears, twice, the, overlaps, get, quite, close, at, the, point, where, the, d, orbitals, enter, the, picture, and, the, order, can, shift, slightly, with, atomic, number, and, atomic, charge, starting, from, the, simplest, atom, this, lets, us, build, up, the, periodic, table, one, at, a, time, in, order, of, atomic, number, by, considering, the, cases, of, single, atoms, in, hydrogen, there, is, only, one, electron, which, must, go, in, the, lowest, energy, orbital, 1s, this, electron, configuration, is, written, 1s, 1, where, the, superscript, indicates, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, subshell, helium, adds, a, second, electron, which, also, goes, into, 1s, completely, filling, the, first, shell, and, giving, the, configuration, 1s, 2, starting, from, the, third, element, lithium, the, first, shell, is, full, so, its, third, electron, occupies, a, 2s, orbital, giving, a, 1s, 2, 2s, 1, configuration, the, 2s, electron, is, lithium, s, only, valence, electron, as, the, 1s, subshell, is, now, too, tightly, bound, to, the, nucleus, to, participate, in, chemical, bonding, to, other, atoms, such, a, shell, is, called, a, core, shell, the, 1s, subshell, is, a, core, shell, for, all, elements, from, lithium, onward, the, 2s, subshell, is, completed, by, the, next, element, beryllium, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, the, following, elements, then, proceed, to, fill, the, 2p, subshell, boron, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 1, puts, its, new, electron, in, a, 2p, orbital, carbon, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 2, fills, a, second, 2p, orbital, and, with, nitrogen, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 3, all, three, 2p, orbitals, become, singly, occupied, this, is, consistent, with, hund, s, rule, which, states, that, atoms, usually, prefer, to, singly, occupy, each, orbital, of, the, same, type, before, filling, them, with, the, second, electron, oxygen, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 4, fluorine, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 5, and, neon, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, then, complete, the, already, singly, filled, 2p, orbitals, the, last, of, these, fills, the, second, shell, completely, starting, from, element, 11, sodium, the, second, shell, is, full, making, the, second, shell, a, core, shell, for, this, and, all, heavier, elements, the, eleventh, electron, begins, the, filling, of, the, third, shell, by, occupying, a, 3s, orbital, giving, a, configuration, of, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, 3s, 1, for, sodium, this, configuration, is, abbreviated, 3s, 1, where, represents, neon, s, configuration, magnesium, 3s, 2, finishes, this, 3s, orbital, and, the, following, six, elements, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and, argon, fill, the, three, 3p, orbitals, 3s, 2, 3p, 1, through, 3s, 2, 3p, 6, this, creates, an, analogous, series, in, which, the, outer, shell, structures, of, sodium, through, argon, are, analogous, to, those, of, lithium, through, neon, and, is, the, basis, for, the, periodicity, of, chemical, properties, that, the, periodic, table, illustrates, at, regular, but, changing, intervals, of, atomic, numbers, the, properties, of, the, chemical, elements, approximately, repeat, the, first, eighteen, elements, can, thus, be, arranged, as, the, start, of, a, periodic, table, elements, in, the, same, column, have, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, and, have, analogous, valence, electron, configurations, these, columns, are, called, groups, the, single, exception, is, helium, which, has, two, valence, electrons, like, beryllium, and, magnesium, but, is, typically, placed, in, the, column, of, neon, and, argon, to, emphasise, that, its, outer, shell, is, full, some, contemporary, authors, question, even, this, single, exception, preferring, to, consistently, follow, the, valence, configurations, and, place, helium, over, beryllium, there, are, eight, columns, in, this, periodic, table, fragment, corresponding, to, at, most, eight, outer, shell, electrons, a, period, begins, when, a, new, shell, starts, filling, finally, the, colouring, illustrates, the, blocks, the, elements, in, the, s, block, coloured, red, are, filling, s, orbitals, while, those, in, the, p, block, coloured, yellow, are, filling, p, orbitals, starting, the, next, row, for, potassium, and, calcium, the, 4s, subshell, is, the, lowest, in, energy, and, therefore, they, fill, it, potassium, adds, one, electron, to, the, 4s, shell, 4s, 1, and, calcium, then, completes, it, 4s, 2, however, starting, from, scandium, 3d, 1, 4s, 2, the, 3d, subshell, becomes, the, next, highest, in, energy, the, 4s, and, 3d, subshells, have, approximately, the, same, energy, and, they, compete, for, filling, the, electrons, and, so, the, occupation, is, not, quite, consistently, filling, the, 3d, orbitals, one, at, a, time, the, precise, energy, ordering, of, 3d, and, 4s, changes, along, the, row, and, also, changes, depending, on, how, many, electrons, are, removed, from, the, atom, for, example, due, to, the, repulsion, between, the, 3d, electrons, and, the, 4s, ones, at, chromium, the, 4s, energy, level, becomes, slightly, higher, than, 3d, and, so, it, becomes, more, profitable, for, a, chromium, atom, to, have, a, 3d, 5, 4s, 1, configuration, than, an, 3d, 4, 4s, 2, one, a, similar, anomaly, occurs, at, copper, whose, atom, has, a, 3d, 10, 4s, 1, configuration, rather, than, the, expected, 3d, 9, 4s, 2, these, are, violations, of, the, madelung, rule, such, anomalies, however, do, not, have, any, chemical, significance, most, chemistry, is, not, about, isolated, gaseous, atoms, and, the, various, configurations, are, so, close, in, energy, to, each, other, that, the, presence, of, a, nearby, atom, can, shift, the, balance, therefore, the, periodic, table, ignores, them, and, considers, only, idealized, configurations, at, zinc, 3d, 10, 4s, 2, the, 3d, orbitals, are, completely, filled, with, a, total, of, ten, electrons, next, come, the, 4p, orbitals, completing, the, row, which, are, filled, progressively, by, gallium, 3d, 10, 4s, 2, 4p, 1, through, krypton, 3d, 10, 4s, 2, 4p, 6, in, a, manner, analogous, to, the, previous, p, block, elements, from, gallium, onwards, the, 3d, orbitals, form, part, of, the, electronic, core, and, no, longer, participate, in, chemistry, the, s, and, p, block, elements, which, fill, their, outer, shells, are, called, main, group, elements, the, d, block, elements, coloured, blue, below, which, fill, an, inner, shell, are, called, transition, elements, or, transition, metals, since, they, are, all, metals, the, next, eighteen, elements, fill, the, 5s, orbitals, rubidium, and, strontium, then, 4d, yttrium, through, cadmium, again, with, a, few, anomalies, along, the, way, and, then, 5p, indium, through, xenon, again, from, indium, onward, the, 4d, orbitals, are, in, the, core, hence, the, fifth, row, has, the, same, structure, as, the, fourth, the, sixth, row, of, the, table, likewise, starts, with, two, s, block, elements, caesium, and, barium, after, this, the, first, f, block, elements, coloured, green, below, begin, to, appear, starting, with, lanthanum, these, are, sometimes, termed, inner, transition, elements, as, there, are, now, not, only, 4f, but, also, 5d, and, 6s, subshells, at, similar, energies, competition, occurs, once, again, with, many, irregular, configurations, this, resulted, in, some, dispute, about, where, exactly, the, f, block, is, supposed, to, begin, but, most, who, study, the, matter, agree, that, it, starts, at, lanthanum, in, accordance, with, the, aufbau, principle, even, though, lanthanum, does, not, itself, fill, the, 4f, subshell, as, a, single, atom, because, of, repulsion, between, electrons, its, 4f, orbitals, are, low, enough, in, energy, to, participate, in, chemistry, at, ytterbium, the, seven, 4f, orbitals, are, completely, filled, with, fourteen, electrons, thereafter, a, series, of, ten, transition, elements, lutetium, through, mercury, follows, and, finally, six, main, group, elements, thallium, through, radon, complete, the, period, from, lutetium, onwards, the, 4f, orbitals, are, in, the, core, and, from, thallium, onwards, so, are, the, 5d, orbitals, the, seventh, row, is, analogous, to, the, sixth, row, 7s, fills, francium, and, radium, then, 5f, actinium, to, nobelium, then, 6d, lawrencium, to, copernicium, and, finally, 7p, nihonium, to, oganesson, starting, from, lawrencium, the, 5f, orbitals, are, in, the, core, and, probably, the, 6d, orbitals, join, the, core, starting, from, nihonium, again, there, are, a, few, anomalies, along, the, way, for, example, as, single, atoms, neither, actinium, nor, thorium, actually, fills, the, 5f, subshell, and, lawrencium, does, not, fill, the, 6d, shell, but, all, these, subshells, can, still, become, filled, in, chemical, environments, for, a, very, long, time, the, seventh, row, was, incomplete, as, most, of, its, elements, do, not, occur, in, nature, the, missing, elements, beyond, uranium, started, to, be, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, in, 1940, when, neptunium, was, made, however, the, first, element, to, be, discovered, by, synthesis, rather, than, in, nature, was, technetium, in, 1937, the, row, was, completed, with, the, synthesis, of, tennessine, in, 2010, the, last, element, oganesson, had, already, been, made, in, 2002, and, the, last, elements, in, this, seventh, row, were, given, names, in, 2016, this, completes, the, modern, periodic, table, with, all, seven, rows, completely, filled, to, capacity, the, following, table, shows, the, electron, configuration, of, a, neutral, gas, phase, atom, of, each, element, different, configurations, can, be, favoured, in, different, chemical, environments, the, main, group, elements, have, entirely, regular, electron, configurations, the, transition, and, inner, transition, elements, show, twenty, irregularities, due, to, the, aforementioned, competition, between, subshells, close, in, energy, level, for, the, last, ten, elements, 109, 118, experimental, data, is, lacking, and, therefore, calculated, configurations, have, been, shown, instead, completely, filled, subshells, have, been, greyed, out, although, the, modern, periodic, table, is, standard, today, the, placement, of, the, period, 1, elements, hydrogen, and, helium, remains, an, open, issue, under, discussion, and, some, variation, can, be, found, following, their, respective, s, 1, and, s, 2, electron, configurations, hydrogen, would, be, placed, in, group, 1, and, helium, would, be, placed, in, group, 2, the, group, 1, placement, of, hydrogen, is, common, but, helium, is, almost, always, placed, in, group, 18, with, the, other, noble, gases, the, debate, has, to, do, with, conflicting, understandings, of, the, extent, to, which, chemical, or, electronic, properties, should, decide, periodic, table, placement, like, the, group, 1, metals, hydrogen, has, one, electron, in, its, outermost, shell, and, typically, loses, its, only, electron, in, chemical, reactions, hydrogen, has, some, metal, like, chemical, properties, being, able, to, displace, some, metals, from, their, salts, but, it, forms, a, diatomic, nonmetallic, gas, at, standard, conditions, unlike, the, alkali, metals, which, are, reactive, solid, metals, this, and, hydrogen, s, formation, of, hydrides, in, which, it, gains, an, electron, brings, it, close, to, the, properties, of, the, halogens, which, do, the, same, though, it, is, rarer, for, hydrogen, to, form, h, than, h, moreover, the, lightest, two, halogens, fluorine, and, chlorine, are, gaseous, like, hydrogen, at, standard, conditions, some, properties, of, hydrogen, are, not, a, good, fit, for, either, group, hydrogen, is, neither, highly, oxidizing, nor, highly, reducing, and, is, not, reactive, with, water, hydrogen, thus, has, properties, corresponding, to, both, those, of, the, alkali, metals, and, the, halogens, but, matches, neither, group, perfectly, and, is, thus, difficult, to, place, by, its, chemistry, therefore, while, the, electronic, placement, of, hydrogen, in, group, 1, predominates, some, rarer, arrangements, show, either, hydrogen, in, group, 17, duplicate, hydrogen, in, both, groups, 1, and, 17, or, float, it, separately, from, all, groups, this, last, option, has, nonetheless, been, criticized, by, the, chemist, and, philosopher, of, science, eric, scerri, on, the, grounds, that, it, appears, to, imply, that, hydrogen, is, above, the, periodic, law, altogether, unlike, all, the, other, elements, helium, is, the, only, element, that, routinely, occupies, a, position, in, the, periodic, table, that, is, not, consistent, with, its, electronic, structure, it, has, two, electrons, in, its, outermost, shell, whereas, the, other, noble, gases, have, eight, and, it, is, an, s, block, element, whereas, all, other, noble, gases, are, p, block, elements, however, it, is, unreactive, at, standard, conditions, and, has, a, full, outer, shell, these, properties, are, like, the, noble, gases, in, group, 18, but, not, at, all, like, the, reactive, alkaline, earth, metals, of, group, 2, for, these, reasons, helium, is, nearly, universally, placed, in, group, 18, which, its, properties, best, match, a, proposal, to, move, helium, to, group, 2, was, rejected, by, iupac, in, 1988, for, these, reasons, nonetheless, helium, is, still, occasionally, placed, in, group, 2, today, and, some, of, its, physical, and, chemical, properties, are, closer, to, the, group, 2, elements, and, support, the, electronic, placement, solid, helium, crystallises, in, a, hexagonal, close, packed, structure, which, matches, beryllium, and, magnesium, in, group, 2, but, not, the, other, noble, gases, in, group, 18, recent, theoretical, developments, in, noble, gas, chemistry, in, which, helium, is, expected, to, show, slightly, less, inertness, than, neon, and, to, form, heo, lif, 2, with, a, structure, similar, to, the, analogous, beryllium, compound, but, with, no, expected, neon, analogue, have, resulted, in, more, chemists, advocating, a, placement, of, helium, in, group, 2, this, relates, to, the, electronic, argument, as, the, reason, for, neon, s, greater, inertness, is, repulsion, from, its, filled, p, shell, that, helium, lacks, though, realistically, it, is, unlikely, that, helium, containing, molecules, will, be, stable, outside, extreme, low, temperature, conditions, around, 10, k, the, first, row, anomaly, in, the, periodic, table, has, additionally, been, cited, to, support, moving, helium, to, group, 2, it, arises, because, the, first, orbital, of, any, type, is, unusually, small, since, unlike, its, higher, analogues, it, does, not, experience, interelectronic, repulsion, from, a, smaller, orbital, of, the, same, type, this, makes, the, first, row, of, elements, in, each, block, unusually, small, and, such, elements, tend, to, exhibit, characteristic, kinds, of, anomalies, for, their, group, some, chemists, arguing, for, the, repositioning, of, helium, have, pointed, out, that, helium, exhibits, these, anomalies, if, it, is, placed, in, group, 2, but, not, if, it, is, placed, in, group, 18, on, the, other, hand, neon, which, would, be, the, first, group, 18, element, if, helium, was, removed, from, that, spot, does, exhibit, those, anomalies, the, relationship, between, helium, and, beryllium, is, then, argued, to, resemble, that, between, hydrogen, and, lithium, a, placement, which, is, much, more, commonly, accepted, for, example, because, of, this, trend, in, the, sizes, of, orbitals, a, large, difference, in, atomic, radii, between, the, first, and, second, members, of, each, main, group, is, seen, in, groups, 1, and, 13, 17, it, exists, between, neon, and, argon, and, between, helium, and, beryllium, but, not, between, helium, and, neon, this, similarly, affects, the, noble, gases, boiling, points, and, solubilities, in, water, where, helium, is, too, close, to, neon, and, the, large, difference, characteristic, between, the, first, two, elements, of, a, group, appears, only, between, neon, and, argon, moving, helium, to, group, 2, makes, this, trend, consistent, in, groups, 2, and, 18, as, well, by, making, helium, the, first, group, 2, element, and, neon, the, first, group, 18, element, both, exhibit, the, characteristic, properties, of, a, kainosymmetric, first, element, of, a, group, the, group, 18, placement, of, helium, nonetheless, remains, near, universal, due, to, its, extreme, inertness, additionally, tables, that, float, both, hydrogen, and, helium, outside, all, groups, may, rarely, be, encountered, in, many, periodic, tables, the, f, block, is, shifted, one, element, to, the, right, so, that, lanthanum, and, actinium, become, d, block, elements, in, group, 3, and, ce, lu, and, th, lr, form, the, f, block, thus, the, d, block, is, split, into, two, very, uneven, portions, this, is, a, holdover, from, early, mistaken, measurements, of, electron, configurations, modern, measurements, are, more, consistent, with, the, form, with, lutetium, and, lawrencium, in, group, 3, and, with, la, yb, and, ac, no, as, the, f, block, the, 4f, shell, is, completely, filled, at, ytterbium, and, for, that, reason, lev, landau, and, evgeny, lifshitz, in, 1948, considered, it, incorrect, to, group, lutetium, as, an, f, block, element, they, did, not, yet, take, the, step, of, removing, lanthanum, from, the, d, block, as, well, but, jun, kond, realized, in, 1963, that, lanthanum, s, low, temperature, superconductivity, implied, the, activity, of, its, 4f, shell, in, 1965, david, c, hamilton, linked, this, observation, to, its, position, in, the, periodic, table, and, argued, that, the, f, block, should, be, composed, of, the, elements, la, yb, and, ac, no, since, then, physical, chemical, and, electronic, evidence, has, supported, this, assignment, the, issue, was, brought, to, wide, attention, by, william, b, jensen, in, 1982, and, the, reassignment, of, lutetium, and, lawrencium, to, group, 3, was, supported, by, iupac, reports, dating, from, 1988, when, the, 1, 18, group, numbers, were, recommended, and, 2021, the, variation, nonetheless, still, exists, because, most, textbook, writers, are, not, aware, of, the, issue, a, third, form, can, sometimes, be, encountered, in, which, the, spaces, below, yttrium, in, group, 3, are, left, empty, such, as, the, table, appearing, on, the, iupac, web, site, but, this, creates, an, inconsistency, with, quantum, mechanics, by, making, the, f, block, 15, elements, wide, la, lu, and, ac, lr, even, though, only, 14, electrons, can, fit, in, an, f, subshell, there, is, moreover, some, confusion, in, the, literature, on, which, elements, are, then, implied, to, be, in, group, 3, while, the, 2021, iupac, report, noted, that, 15, element, wide, f, blocks, are, supported, by, some, practitioners, of, a, specialized, branch, of, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, focusing, on, the, properties, of, superheavy, elements, the, project, s, opinion, was, that, such, interest, dependent, concerns, should, not, have, any, bearing, on, how, the, periodic, table, is, presented, to, the, general, chemical, and, scientific, community, other, authors, focusing, on, superheavy, elements, since, clarified, that, the, 15th, entry, of, the, f, block, represents, the, first, slot, of, the, d, block, which, is, left, vacant, to, indicate, the, place, of, the, f, block, inserts, which, would, imply, that, this, form, still, has, lutetium, and, lawrencium, the, 15th, entries, in, question, as, d, block, elements, in, group, 3, indeed, when, iupac, publications, expand, the, table, to, 32, columns, they, make, this, clear, and, place, lutetium, and, lawrencium, under, yttrium, in, group, 3, several, arguments, in, favour, of, sc, y, la, ac, can, be, encountered, in, the, literature, but, they, have, been, challenged, as, being, logically, inconsistent, for, example, it, has, been, argued, that, lanthanum, and, actinium, cannot, be, f, block, elements, because, as, individual, gas, phase, atoms, they, have, not, begun, to, fill, the, f, subshells, but, the, same, is, true, of, thorium, which, is, never, disputed, as, an, f, block, element, and, this, argument, overlooks, the, problem, on, the, other, end, that, the, f, shells, complete, filling, at, ytterbium, and, nobelium, matching, the, sc, y, lu, lr, form, and, not, at, lutetium, and, lawrencium, as, the, sc, y, la, ac, form, would, have, it, not, only, are, such, exceptional, configurations, in, the, minority, but, they, have, also, in, any, case, never, been, considered, as, relevant, for, positioning, any, other, elements, on, the, periodic, table, in, gaseous, atoms, the, d, shells, complete, their, filling, at, copper, palladium, and, gold, but, it, is, universally, accepted, by, chemists, that, these, configurations, are, exceptional, and, that, the, d, block, really, ends, in, accordance, with, the, madelung, rule, at, zinc, cadmium, and, mercury, the, relevant, fact, for, placement, is, that, lanthanum, and, actinium, like, thorium, have, valence, f, orbitals, that, can, become, occupied, in, chemical, environments, whereas, lutetium, and, lawrencium, do, not, their, f, shells, are, in, the, core, and, cannot, be, used, for, chemical, reactions, thus, the, relationship, between, yttrium, and, lanthanum, is, only, a, secondary, relationship, between, elements, with, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, but, different, kinds, of, valence, orbitals, such, as, that, between, chromium, and, uranium, whereas, the, relationship, between, yttrium, and, lutetium, is, primary, sharing, both, valence, electron, count, and, valence, orbital, type, as, chemical, reactions, involve, the, valence, electrons, elements, with, similar, outer, electron, configurations, may, be, expected, to, react, similarly, and, form, compounds, with, similar, proportions, of, elements, in, them, such, elements, are, placed, in, the, same, group, and, thus, there, tend, to, be, clear, similarities, and, trends, in, chemical, behaviour, as, one, proceeds, down, a, group, as, analogous, configurations, occur, at, regular, intervals, the, properties, of, the, elements, thus, exhibit, periodic, recurrences, hence, the, name, of, the, periodic, table, and, the, periodic, law, these, periodic, recurrences, were, noticed, well, before, the, underlying, theory, that, explains, them, was, developed, historically, the, physical, size, of, atoms, was, unknown, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, first, calculated, estimate, of, the, atomic, radius, of, hydrogen, was, published, by, physicist, arthur, haas, in, 1910, to, within, an, order, of, magnitude, a, factor, of, 10, of, the, accepted, value, the, bohr, radius, 0, 529, in, his, model, haas, used, a, single, electron, configuration, based, on, the, classical, atomic, model, proposed, by, j, j, thomson, in, 1904, often, called, the, plum, pudding, model, atomic, radii, the, size, of, atoms, are, dependent, on, the, sizes, of, their, outermost, orbitals, they, generally, decrease, going, left, to, right, along, the, main, group, elements, because, the, nuclear, charge, increases, but, the, outer, electrons, are, still, in, the, same, shell, however, going, down, a, column, the, radii, generally, increase, because, the, outermost, electrons, are, in, higher, shells, that, are, thus, further, away, from, the, nucleus, the, first, row, of, each, block, is, abnormally, small, due, to, an, effect, called, kainosymmetry, or, primogenic, repulsion, the, 1s, 2p, 3d, and, 4f, subshells, have, no, inner, analogues, for, example, the, 2p, orbitals, do, not, experience, strong, repulsion, from, the, 1s, and, 2s, orbitals, which, have, quite, different, angular, charge, distributions, and, hence, are, not, very, large, but, the, 3p, orbitals, experience, strong, repulsion, from, the, 2p, orbitals, which, have, similar, angular, charge, distributions, thus, higher, s, p, d, and, f, subshells, experience, strong, repulsion, from, their, inner, analogues, which, have, approximately, the, same, angular, distribution, of, charge, and, must, expand, to, avoid, this, this, makes, significant, differences, arise, between, the, small, 2p, elements, which, prefer, multiple, bonding, and, the, larger, 3p, and, higher, p, elements, which, do, not, similar, anomalies, arise, for, the, 1s, 2p, 3d, 4f, and, the, hypothetical, 5g, elements, the, degree, of, this, first, row, anomaly, is, highest, for, the, s, block, is, moderate, for, the, p, block, and, is, less, pronounced, for, the, d, and, f, blocks, in, the, transition, elements, an, inner, shell, is, filling, but, the, size, of, the, atom, is, still, determined, by, the, outer, electrons, the, increasing, nuclear, charge, across, the, series, and, the, increased, number, of, inner, electrons, for, shielding, somewhat, compensate, each, other, so, the, decrease, in, radius, is, smaller, the, 4p, and, 5d, atoms, coming, immediately, after, new, types, of, transition, series, are, first, introduced, are, smaller, than, would, have, been, expected, because, the, added, core, 3d, and, 4f, subshells, provide, only, incomplete, shielding, of, the, nuclear, charge, for, the, outer, electrons, hence, for, example, gallium, atoms, are, slightly, smaller, than, aluminium, atoms, together, with, kainosymmetry, this, results, in, an, even, odd, difference, between, the, periods, except, in, the, s, block, that, is, sometimes, known, as, secondary, periodicity, elements, in, even, periods, have, smaller, atomic, radii, and, prefer, to, lose, fewer, electrons, while, elements, in, odd, periods, except, the, first, differ, in, the, opposite, direction, thus, for, example, many, properties, in, the, p, block, show, a, zigzag, rather, than, a, smooth, trend, along, the, group, for, example, phosphorus, and, antimony, in, odd, periods, of, group, 15, readily, reach, the, 5, oxidation, state, whereas, nitrogen, arsenic, and, bismuth, in, even, periods, prefer, to, stay, at, 3, a, similar, situation, holds, for, the, d, block, with, lutetium, through, tungsten, atoms, being, slightly, smaller, than, yttrium, through, molybdenum, atoms, respectively, thallium, and, lead, atoms, are, about, the, same, size, as, indium, and, tin, atoms, respectively, but, from, bismuth, to, radon, the, 6p, atoms, are, larger, than, the, analogous, 5p, atoms, this, happens, because, when, atomic, nuclei, become, highly, charged, special, relativity, becomes, needed, to, gauge, the, effect, of, the, nucleus, on, the, electron, cloud, these, relativistic, effects, result, in, heavy, elements, increasingly, having, differing, properties, compared, to, their, lighter, homologues, in, the, periodic, table, spin, orbit, interaction, splits, the, p, subshell, one, p, orbital, is, relativistically, stabilized, and, shrunken, it, fills, in, thallium, and, lead, but, the, other, two, filling, in, bismuth, through, radon, are, relativistically, destabilized, and, expanded, relativistic, effects, also, explain, why, gold, is, golden, and, mercury, is, a, liquid, at, room, temperature, they, are, expected, to, become, very, strong, in, the, late, seventh, period, potentially, leading, to, a, collapse, of, periodicity, electron, configurations, are, only, clearly, known, until, element, 108, hassium, and, experimental, chemistry, beyond, 108, has, only, been, done, for, 112, copernicium, 113, nihonium, and, 114, flerovium, so, the, chemical, characterization, of, the, heaviest, elements, remains, a, topic, of, current, research, the, trend, that, atomic, radii, decrease, from, left, to, right, is, also, present, in, ionic, radii, though, it, is, more, difficult, to, examine, because, the, most, common, ions, of, consecutive, elements, normally, differ, in, charge, ions, with, the, same, electron, configuration, decrease, in, size, as, their, atomic, number, rises, due, to, increased, attraction, from, the, more, positively, charged, nucleus, thus, for, example, ionic, radii, decrease, in, the, series, se, 2, br, rb, sr, 2, y, 3, zr, 4, nb, 5, mo, 6, tc, 7, ions, of, the, same, element, get, smaller, as, more, electrons, are, removed, because, the, attraction, from, the, nucleus, begins, to, outweigh, the, repulsion, between, electrons, that, causes, electron, clouds, to, expand, thus, for, example, ionic, radii, decrease, in, the, series, v, 2, v, 3, v, 4, v, 5, the, first, ionisation, energy, of, an, atom, is, the, energy, required, to, remove, an, electron, from, it, this, varies, with, the, atomic, radius, ionisation, energy, increases, left, to, right, and, down, to, up, because, electrons, that, are, closer, to, the, nucleus, are, held, more, tightly, and, are, more, difficult, to, remove, ionisation, energy, thus, is, minimized, at, the, first, element, of, each, period, hydrogen, and, the, alkali, metals, and, then, generally, rises, until, it, reaches, the, noble, gas, at, the, right, edge, of, the, period, there, are, some, exceptions, to, this, trend, such, as, oxygen, where, the, electron, being, removed, is, paired, and, thus, interelectronic, repulsion, makes, it, easier, to, remove, than, expected, in, the, transition, series, the, outer, electrons, are, preferentially, lost, even, though, the, inner, orbitals, are, filling, for, example, in, the, 3d, series, the, 4s, electrons, are, lost, first, even, though, the, 3d, orbitals, are, being, filled, the, shielding, effect, of, adding, an, extra, 3d, electron, approximately, compensates, the, rise, in, nuclear, charge, and, therefore, the, ionisation, energies, stay, mostly, constant, though, there, is, a, small, increase, especially, at, the, end, of, each, transition, series, as, metal, atoms, tend, to, lose, electrons, in, chemical, reactions, ionisation, energy, is, generally, correlated, with, chemical, reactivity, although, there, are, other, factors, involved, as, well, the, opposite, property, to, ionisation, energy, is, the, electron, affinity, which, is, the, energy, released, when, adding, an, electron, to, the, atom, a, passing, electron, will, be, more, readily, attracted, to, an, atom, if, it, feels, the, pull, of, the, nucleus, more, strongly, and, especially, if, there, is, an, available, partially, filled, outer, orbital, that, can, accommodate, it, therefore, electron, affinity, tends, to, increase, down, to, up, and, left, to, right, the, exception, is, the, last, column, the, noble, gases, which, have, a, full, shell, and, have, no, room, for, another, electron, this, gives, the, halogens, in, the, next, to, last, column, the, highest, electron, affinities, some, atoms, like, the, noble, gases, have, no, electron, affinity, they, cannot, form, stable, gas, phase, anions, they, can, form, metastable, resonances, if, the, incoming, electron, arrives, with, enough, kinetic, energy, but, these, inevitably, and, rapidly, autodetach, for, example, the, lifetime, of, the, most, long, lived, he, level, is, about, 359, microseconds, the, noble, gases, having, high, ionisation, energies, and, no, electron, affinity, have, little, inclination, towards, gaining, or, losing, electrons, and, are, generally, unreactive, some, exceptions, to, the, trends, occur, oxygen, and, fluorine, have, lower, electron, affinities, than, their, heavier, homologues, sulfur, and, chlorine, because, they, are, small, atoms, and, hence, the, newly, added, electron, would, experience, significant, repulsion, from, the, already, present, ones, for, the, nonmetallic, elements, electron, affinity, likewise, somewhat, correlates, with, reactivity, but, not, perfectly, since, other, factors, are, involved, for, example, fluorine, has, a, lower, electron, affinity, than, chlorine, because, of, extreme, interelectronic, repulsion, for, the, very, small, fluorine, atom, but, is, more, reactive, the, valence, of, an, element, can, be, defined, either, as, the, number, of, hydrogen, atoms, that, can, combine, with, it, to, form, a, simple, binary, hydride, or, as, twice, the, number, of, oxygen, atoms, that, can, combine, with, it, to, form, a, simple, binary, oxide, that, is, not, a, peroxide, or, a, superoxide, the, valences, of, the, main, group, elements, are, directly, related, to, the, group, number, the, hydrides, in, the, main, groups, 1, 2, and, 13, 17, follow, the, formulae, mh, mh, 2, mh, 3, mh, 4, mh, 3, mh, 2, and, finally, mh, the, highest, oxides, instead, increase, in, valence, following, the, formulae, m, 2, o, mo, m, 2, o, 3, mo, 2, m, 2, o, 5, mo, 3, m, 2, o, 7, today, the, notion, of, valence, has, been, extended, by, that, of, the, oxidation, state, which, is, the, formal, charge, left, on, an, element, when, all, other, elements, in, a, compound, have, been, removed, as, their, ions, the, electron, configuration, suggests, a, ready, explanation, from, the, number, of, electrons, available, for, bonding, indeed, the, number, of, valence, electrons, starts, at, 1, in, group, 1, and, then, increases, towards, the, right, side, of, the, periodic, table, only, resetting, at, 3, whenever, each, new, block, starts, thus, in, period, 6, cs, ba, have, 1, 2, valence, electrons, la, yb, have, 3, 16, lu, hg, have, 3, 12, and, tl, rn, have, 3, 8, however, towards, the, right, side, of, the, d, and, f, blocks, the, theoretical, maximum, corresponding, to, using, all, valence, electrons, is, not, achievable, at, all, the, same, situation, affects, oxygen, fluorine, and, the, light, noble, gases, up, to, krypton, a, full, explanation, requires, considering, the, energy, that, would, be, released, in, forming, compounds, with, different, valences, rather, than, simply, considering, electron, configurations, alone, for, example, magnesium, forms, mg, 2, rather, than, mg, cations, when, dissolved, in, water, because, the, latter, would, spontaneously, disproportionate, into, mg, 0, and, mg, 2, cations, this, is, because, the, enthalpy, of, hydration, surrounding, the, cation, with, water, molecules, increases, in, magnitude, with, the, charge, and, radius, of, the, ion, in, mg, the, outermost, orbital, which, determines, ionic, radius, is, still, 3s, so, the, hydration, enthalpy, is, small, and, insufficient, to, compensate, the, energy, required, to, remove, the, electron, but, ionizing, again, to, mg, 2, uncovers, the, core, 2p, subshell, making, the, hydration, enthalpy, large, enough, to, allow, magnesium, ii, compounds, to, form, for, similar, reasons, the, common, oxidation, states, of, the, heavier, p, block, elements, where, the, ns, electrons, become, lower, in, energy, than, the, np, tend, to, vary, by, steps, of, 2, because, that, is, necessary, to, uncover, an, inner, subshell, and, decrease, the, ionic, radius, e, g, tl, uncovers, 6s, and, tl, 3, uncovers, 5d, so, once, thallium, loses, two, electrons, it, tends, to, lose, the, third, one, as, well, analogous, arguments, based, on, orbital, hybridization, can, be, used, for, the, less, electronegative, p, block, elements, for, transition, metals, common, oxidation, states, are, nearly, always, at, least, 2, for, similar, reasons, uncovering, the, next, subshell, this, holds, even, for, the, metals, with, anomalous, d, x, 1, s, 1, or, d, x, 2, s, 0, configurations, except, for, silver, because, repulsion, between, d, electrons, means, that, the, movement, of, the, second, electron, from, the, s, to, the, d, subshell, does, not, appreciably, change, its, ionisation, energy, because, ionizing, the, transition, metals, further, does, not, uncover, any, new, inner, subshells, their, oxidation, states, tend, to, vary, by, steps, of, 1, instead, the, lanthanides, and, late, actinides, generally, show, a, stable, 3, oxidation, state, removing, the, outer, s, electrons, and, then, usually, one, electron, from, the, n, 2, f, orbitals, that, are, similar, in, energy, to, ns, the, common, and, maximum, oxidation, states, of, the, d, and, f, block, elements, tend, to, depend, on, the, ionisation, energies, as, the, energy, difference, between, the, n, 1, d, and, ns, orbitals, rises, along, each, transition, series, it, becomes, less, energetically, favourable, to, ionize, further, electrons, thus, the, early, transition, metal, groups, tend, to, prefer, higher, oxidation, states, but, the, 2, oxidation, state, becomes, more, stable, for, the, late, transition, metal, groups, the, highest, formal, oxidation, state, thus, increases, from, 3, at, the, beginning, of, each, d, block, row, to, 7, or, 8, in, the, middle, e, g, oso, 4, and, then, decrease, to, 2, at, the, end, the, lanthanides, and, late, actinides, usually, have, high, fourth, ionisation, energies, and, hence, rarely, surpass, the, 3, oxidation, state, whereas, early, actinides, have, low, fourth, ionisation, energies, and, so, for, example, neptunium, and, plutonium, can, reach, 7, the, very, last, actinides, go, further, than, the, lanthanides, towards, low, oxidation, states, mendelevium, is, more, easily, reduced, to, the, 2, state, than, thulium, or, even, europium, the, lanthanide, with, the, most, stable, 2, state, on, account, of, its, half, filled, f, shell, and, nobelium, outright, favours, 2, over, 3, in, contrast, to, ytterbium, as, elements, in, the, same, group, share, the, same, valence, configurations, they, usually, exhibit, similar, chemical, behaviour, for, example, the, alkali, metals, in, the, first, group, all, have, one, valence, electron, and, form, a, very, homogeneous, class, of, elements, they, are, all, soft, and, reactive, metals, however, there, are, many, factors, involved, and, groups, can, often, be, rather, heterogeneous, for, instance, hydrogen, also, has, one, valence, electron, and, is, in, the, same, group, as, the, alkali, metals, but, its, chemical, behaviour, is, quite, different, the, stable, elements, of, group, 14, comprise, a, nonmetal, carbon, two, semiconductors, silicon, and, germanium, and, two, metals, tin, and, lead, they, are, nonetheless, united, by, having, four, valence, electrons, this, often, leads, to, similarities, in, maximum, and, minimum, oxidation, states, e, g, sulfur, and, selenium, in, group, 16, both, have, maximum, oxidation, state, 6, as, in, so, 3, and, seo, 3, and, minimum, oxidation, state, 2, as, in, sulfides, and, selenides, but, not, always, e, g, oxygen, is, not, known, to, form, oxidation, state, 6, despite, being, in, the, same, group, as, sulfur, and, selenium, another, important, property, of, elements, is, their, electronegativity, atoms, can, form, covalent, bonds, to, each, other, by, sharing, electrons, in, pairs, creating, an, overlap, of, valence, orbitals, the, degree, to, which, each, atom, attracts, the, shared, electron, pair, depends, on, the, atom, s, electronegativity, the, tendency, of, an, atom, towards, gaining, or, losing, electrons, the, more, electronegative, atom, will, tend, to, attract, the, electron, pair, more, and, the, less, electronegative, or, more, electropositive, one, will, attract, it, less, in, extreme, cases, the, electron, can, be, thought, of, as, having, been, passed, completely, from, the, more, electropositive, atom, to, the, more, electronegative, one, though, this, is, a, simplification, the, bond, then, binds, two, ions, one, positive, having, given, up, the, electron, and, one, negative, having, accepted, it, and, is, termed, an, ionic, bond, electronegativity, depends, on, how, strongly, the, nucleus, can, attract, an, electron, pair, and, so, it, exhibits, a, similar, variation, to, the, other, properties, already, discussed, electronegativity, tends, to, fall, going, up, to, down, and, rise, going, left, to, right, the, alkali, and, alkaline, earth, metals, are, among, the, most, electropositive, elements, while, the, chalcogens, halogens, and, noble, gases, are, among, the, most, electronegative, ones, electronegativity, is, generally, measured, on, the, pauling, scale, on, which, the, most, electronegative, reactive, atom, fluorine, is, given, electronegativity, 4, 0, and, the, least, electronegative, atom, caesium, is, given, electronegativity, 0, 79, in, fact, neon, is, the, most, electronegative, element, but, the, pauling, scale, cannot, measure, its, electronegativity, because, it, does, not, form, covalent, bonds, with, most, elements, an, element, s, electronegativity, varies, with, the, identity, and, number, of, the, atoms, it, is, bonded, to, as, well, as, how, many, electrons, it, has, already, lost, an, atom, becomes, more, electronegative, when, it, has, lost, more, electrons, this, sometimes, makes, a, large, difference, lead, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, has, electronegativity, 1, 87, on, the, pauling, scale, while, lead, in, the, 4, oxidation, state, has, electronegativity, 2, 33, a, simple, substance, is, a, substance, formed, from, atoms, of, one, chemical, element, the, simple, substances, of, the, more, electronegative, atoms, tend, to, share, electrons, form, covalent, bonds, with, each, other, they, form, either, small, molecules, like, hydrogen, or, oxygen, whose, atoms, bond, in, pairs, or, giant, structures, stretching, indefinitely, like, carbon, or, silicon, the, noble, gases, simply, stay, as, single, atoms, as, they, already, have, a, full, shell, substances, composed, of, discrete, molecules, or, single, atoms, are, held, together, by, weaker, attractive, forces, between, the, molecules, such, as, the, london, dispersion, force, as, electrons, move, within, the, molecules, they, create, momentary, imbalances, of, electrical, charge, which, induce, similar, imbalances, on, nearby, molecules, and, create, synchronized, movements, of, electrons, across, many, neighbouring, molecules, the, more, electropositive, atoms, however, tend, to, instead, lose, electrons, creating, a, sea, of, electrons, engulfing, cations, the, outer, orbitals, of, one, atom, overlap, to, share, electrons, with, all, its, neighbours, creating, a, giant, structure, of, molecular, orbitals, extending, over, all, the, atoms, this, negatively, charged, sea, pulls, on, all, the, ions, and, keeps, them, together, in, a, metallic, bond, elements, forming, such, bonds, are, often, called, metals, those, which, do, not, are, often, called, nonmetals, some, elements, can, form, multiple, simple, substances, with, different, structures, these, are, called, allotropes, for, example, diamond, and, graphite, are, two, allotropes, of, carbon, the, metallicity, of, an, element, can, be, predicted, from, electronic, properties, when, atomic, orbitals, overlap, during, metallic, or, covalent, bonding, they, create, both, bonding, and, antibonding, molecular, orbitals, of, equal, capacity, with, the, antibonding, orbitals, of, higher, energy, net, bonding, character, occurs, when, there, are, more, electrons, in, the, bonding, orbitals, than, there, are, in, the, antibonding, orbitals, metallic, bonding, is, thus, possible, when, the, number, of, electrons, delocalized, by, each, atom, is, less, than, twice, the, number, of, orbitals, contributing, to, the, overlap, this, is, the, situation, for, elements, in, groups, 1, through, 13, they, also, have, too, few, valence, electrons, to, form, giant, covalent, structures, where, all, atoms, take, equivalent, positions, and, so, almost, all, of, them, metallise, the, exceptions, are, hydrogen, and, boron, which, have, too, high, an, ionisation, energy, hydrogen, thus, forms, a, covalent, h, 2, molecule, and, boron, forms, a, giant, covalent, structure, based, on, icosahedral, b, 12, clusters, in, a, metal, the, bonding, and, antibonding, orbitals, have, overlapping, energies, creating, a, single, band, that, electrons, can, freely, flow, through, allowing, for, electrical, conduction, in, group, 14, both, metallic, and, covalent, bonding, become, possible, in, a, diamond, crystal, covalent, bonds, between, carbon, atoms, are, strong, because, they, have, a, small, atomic, radius, and, thus, the, nucleus, has, more, of, a, hold, on, the, electrons, therefore, the, bonding, orbitals, that, result, are, much, lower, in, energy, than, the, antibonding, orbitals, and, there, is, no, overlap, so, electrical, conduction, becomes, impossible, carbon, is, a, nonmetal, however, covalent, bonding, becomes, weaker, for, larger, atoms, and, the, energy, gap, between, the, bonding, and, antibonding, orbitals, decreases, therefore, silicon, and, germanium, have, smaller, band, gaps, and, are, semiconductors, at, ambient, conditions, electrons, can, cross, the, gap, when, thermally, excited, boron, is, also, a, semiconductor, at, ambient, conditions, the, band, gap, disappears, in, tin, so, that, tin, and, lead, become, metals, as, the, temperature, rises, all, nonmetals, develop, some, semiconducting, properties, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, depending, on, the, size, of, the, band, gap, thus, metals, and, nonmetals, may, be, distinguished, by, the, temperature, dependence, of, their, electrical, conductivity, a, metal, s, conductivity, lowers, as, temperature, rises, because, thermal, motion, makes, it, more, difficult, for, the, electrons, to, flow, freely, whereas, a, nonmetal, s, conductivity, rises, as, more, electrons, may, be, excited, to, cross, the, gap, elements, in, groups, 15, through, 17, have, too, many, electrons, to, form, giant, covalent, molecules, that, stretch, in, all, three, dimensions, for, the, lighter, elements, the, bonds, in, small, diatomic, molecules, are, so, strong, that, a, condensed, phase, is, disfavoured, thus, nitrogen, n, 2, oxygen, o, 2, white, phosphorus, and, yellow, arsenic, p, 4, and, as, 4, sulfur, and, red, selenium, s, 8, and, se, 8, and, the, stable, halogens, f, 2, cl, 2, br, 2, and, i, 2, readily, form, covalent, molecules, with, few, atoms, the, heavier, ones, tend, to, form, long, chains, e, g, red, phosphorus, grey, selenium, tellurium, or, layered, structures, e, g, carbon, as, graphite, black, phosphorus, grey, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, that, only, extend, in, one, or, two, rather, than, three, dimensions, both, kinds, of, structures, can, be, found, as, allotropes, of, phosphorus, arsenic, and, selenium, although, the, long, chained, allotropes, are, more, stable, in, all, three, as, these, structures, do, not, use, all, their, orbitals, for, bonding, they, end, up, with, bonding, nonbonding, and, antibonding, bands, in, order, of, increasing, energy, similarly, to, group, 14, the, band, gaps, shrink, for, the, heavier, elements, and, free, movement, of, electrons, between, the, chains, or, layers, becomes, possible, thus, for, example, black, phosphorus, black, arsenic, grey, selenium, tellurium, and, iodine, are, semiconductors, grey, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, are, semimetals, exhibiting, quasi, metallic, conduction, with, a, very, small, band, overlap, and, polonium, and, probably, astatine, are, true, metals, finally, the, natural, group, 18, elements, all, stay, as, individual, atoms, the, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, is, roughly, diagonal, from, top, left, to, bottom, right, with, the, transition, series, appearing, to, the, left, of, this, diagonal, as, they, have, many, available, orbitals, for, overlap, this, is, expected, as, metallicity, tends, to, be, correlated, with, electropositivity, and, the, willingness, to, lose, electrons, which, increases, right, to, left, and, up, to, down, thus, the, metals, greatly, outnumber, the, nonmetals, elements, near, the, borderline, are, difficult, to, classify, they, tend, to, have, properties, that, are, intermediate, between, those, of, metals, and, nonmetals, and, may, have, some, properties, characteristic, of, both, they, are, often, termed, semimetals, or, metalloids, the, term, semimetal, used, in, this, sense, should, not, be, confused, with, its, strict, physical, sense, having, to, do, with, band, structure, bismuth, is, physically, a, semimetal, but, is, generally, considered, a, metal, by, chemists, the, following, table, considers, the, most, stable, allotropes, at, standard, conditions, the, elements, coloured, yellow, form, simple, substances, that, are, well, characterised, by, metallic, bonding, elements, coloured, light, blue, form, giant, network, covalent, structures, whereas, those, coloured, dark, blue, form, small, covalently, bonded, molecules, that, are, held, together, by, weaker, van, der, waals, forces, the, noble, gases, are, coloured, in, violet, their, molecules, are, single, atoms, and, no, covalent, bonding, occurs, greyed, out, cells, are, for, elements, which, have, not, been, prepared, in, sufficient, quantities, for, their, most, stable, allotropes, to, have, been, characterized, in, this, way, theoretical, considerations, and, current, experimental, evidence, suggest, that, all, of, those, elements, would, metallise, if, they, could, form, condensed, phases, except, perhaps, for, oganesson, metallic, network, covalent, molecular, covalent, single, atoms, unknown, background, color, shows, bonding, of, simple, substances, in, the, periodic, table, if, there, are, several, the, most, stable, allotrope, is, considered, generally, metals, are, shiny, and, dense, they, usually, have, high, melting, and, boiling, points, due, to, the, strength, of, the, metallic, bond, and, are, often, malleable, and, ductile, easily, stretched, and, shaped, because, the, atoms, can, move, relative, to, each, other, without, breaking, the, metallic, bond, they, conduct, electricity, because, their, electrons, are, free, to, move, in, all, three, dimensions, similarly, they, conduct, heat, which, is, transferred, by, the, electrons, as, extra, kinetic, energy, they, move, faster, these, properties, persist, in, the, liquid, state, as, although, the, crystal, structure, is, destroyed, on, melting, the, atoms, still, touch, and, the, metallic, bond, persists, though, it, is, weakened, metals, tend, to, be, reactive, towards, nonmetals, some, exceptions, can, be, found, to, these, generalizations, for, example, beryllium, chromium, manganese, antimony, bismuth, and, uranium, are, brittle, not, an, exhaustive, list, chromium, is, extremely, hard, gallium, rubidium, caesium, and, mercury, are, liquid, at, or, close, to, room, temperature, and, noble, metals, such, as, gold, are, chemically, very, inert, nonmetals, exhibit, different, properties, those, forming, giant, covalent, crystals, exhibit, high, melting, and, boiling, points, as, it, takes, considerable, energy, to, overcome, the, strong, covalent, bonds, those, forming, discrete, molecules, are, held, together, mostly, by, dispersion, forces, which, are, more, easily, overcome, thus, they, tend, to, have, lower, melting, and, boiling, points, and, many, are, liquids, or, gases, at, room, temperature, nonmetals, are, often, dull, looking, they, tend, to, be, reactive, towards, metals, except, for, the, noble, gases, which, are, inert, towards, most, substances, they, are, brittle, when, solid, as, their, atoms, are, held, tightly, in, place, they, are, less, dense, and, conduct, electricity, poorly, because, there, are, no, mobile, electrons, near, the, borderline, band, gaps, are, small, and, thus, many, elements, in, that, region, are, semiconductors, such, as, silicon, germanium, and, tellurium, selenium, has, both, a, semiconducting, grey, allotrope, and, an, insulating, red, allotrope, arsenic, has, a, metallic, grey, allotrope, a, semiconducting, black, allotrope, and, an, insulating, yellow, allotrope, though, the, last, is, unstable, at, ambient, conditions, again, there, are, exceptions, for, example, diamond, has, the, highest, thermal, conductivity, of, all, known, materials, greater, than, any, metal, it, is, common, to, designate, a, class, of, metalloids, straddling, the, boundary, between, metals, and, nonmetals, as, elements, in, that, region, are, intermediate, in, both, physical, and, chemical, properties, however, no, consensus, exists, in, the, literature, for, precisely, which, elements, should, be, so, designated, when, such, a, category, is, used, silicon, germanium, arsenic, and, tellurium, are, almost, always, included, and, boron, and, antimony, usually, are, but, most, sources, include, other, elements, as, well, without, agreement, on, which, extra, elements, should, be, added, and, some, others, subtract, from, this, list, instead, for, example, unlike, all, the, other, elements, generally, considered, metalloids, or, nonmetals, antimony, s, only, stable, form, has, metallic, conductivity, moreover, the, element, resembles, bismuth, and, more, generally, the, other, p, block, metals, in, its, physical, and, chemical, behaviour, on, this, basis, some, authors, have, argued, that, it, is, better, classified, as, a, metal, than, as, a, metalloid, on, the, other, hand, selenium, has, some, semiconducting, properties, in, its, most, stable, form, though, it, also, has, insulating, allotropes, and, it, has, been, argued, that, it, should, be, considered, a, metalloid, though, this, situation, also, holds, for, phosphorus, which, is, a, much, rarer, inclusion, among, the, metalloids, there, are, some, other, relationships, throughout, the, periodic, table, between, elements, that, are, not, in, the, same, group, such, as, the, diagonal, relationships, between, elements, that, are, diagonally, adjacent, e, g, lithium, and, magnesium, some, similarities, can, also, be, found, between, the, main, groups, and, the, transition, metal, groups, or, between, the, early, actinides, and, early, transition, metals, when, the, elements, have, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, thus, uranium, somewhat, resembles, chromium, and, tungsten, in, group, 6, as, all, three, have, six, valence, electrons, relationships, between, elements, with, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, but, different, types, of, valence, orbital, have, been, called, secondary, or, isodonor, relationships, they, usually, have, the, same, maximum, oxidation, states, but, not, the, same, minimum, oxidation, states, for, example, chlorine, and, manganese, both, have, 7, as, their, maximum, oxidation, state, e, g, cl, 2, o, 7, and, mn, 2, o, 7, but, their, respective, minimum, oxidation, states, are, 1, e, g, hcl, and, 3, k, 2, elements, with, the, same, number, of, valence, vacancies, but, different, numbers, of, valence, electrons, are, related, by, a, tertiary, or, isoacceptor, relationship, they, usually, have, similar, minimum, but, not, maximum, oxidation, states, for, example, hydrogen, and, chlorine, both, have, 1, as, their, minimum, oxidation, state, in, hydrides, and, chlorides, but, hydrogen, s, maximum, oxidation, state, is, 1, e, g, h, 2, o, while, chlorine, s, is, 7, many, other, physical, properties, of, the, elements, exhibit, periodic, variation, in, accordance, with, the, periodic, law, such, as, melting, points, boiling, points, heats, of, fusion, heats, of, vaporization, atomisation, energy, and, so, on, similar, periodic, variations, appear, for, the, compounds, of, the, elements, which, can, be, observed, by, comparing, hydrides, oxides, sulfides, halides, and, so, on, chemical, properties, are, more, difficult, to, describe, quantitatively, but, likewise, exhibit, their, own, periodicities, examples, include, the, variation, in, the, acidic, and, basic, properties, of, the, elements, and, their, compounds, the, stabilities, of, compounds, and, methods, of, isolating, the, elements, periodicity, is, and, has, been, used, very, widely, to, predict, the, properties, of, unknown, new, elements, and, new, compounds, and, is, central, to, modern, chemistry, many, terms, have, been, used, in, the, literature, to, describe, sets, of, elements, that, behave, similarly, the, group, names, alkali, metal, alkaline, earth, metal, triel, tetrel, pnictogen, chalcogen, halogen, and, noble, gas, are, acknowledged, by, iupac, the, other, groups, can, be, referred, to, by, their, number, or, by, their, first, element, e, g, group, 6, is, the, chromium, group, some, divide, the, p, block, elements, from, groups, 13, to, 16, by, metallicity, although, there, is, neither, an, iupac, definition, nor, a, precise, consensus, on, exactly, which, elements, should, be, considered, metals, nonmetals, or, semi, metals, sometimes, called, metalloids, neither, is, there, a, consensus, on, what, the, metals, succeeding, the, transition, metals, ought, to, be, called, with, post, transition, metal, and, poor, metal, being, among, the, possibilities, having, been, used, some, advanced, monographs, exclude, the, elements, of, group, 12, from, the, transition, metals, on, the, grounds, of, their, sometimes, quite, different, chemical, properties, but, this, is, not, a, universal, practice, and, iupac, does, not, presently, mention, it, as, allowable, in, its, principles, of, chemical, nomenclature, the, lanthanides, are, considered, to, be, the, elements, la, lu, which, are, all, very, similar, to, each, other, historically, they, included, only, ce, lu, but, lanthanum, became, included, by, common, usage, the, rare, earth, elements, or, rare, earth, metals, add, scandium, and, yttrium, to, the, lanthanides, analogously, the, actinides, are, considered, to, be, the, elements, ac, lr, historically, th, lr, although, variation, of, properties, in, this, set, is, much, greater, than, within, the, lanthanides, iupac, recommends, the, names, lanthanoids, and, actinoids, to, avoid, ambiguity, as, the, ide, suffix, typically, denotes, a, negative, ion, however, lanthanides, and, actinides, remain, common, with, the, increasing, recognition, of, lutetium, and, lawrencium, as, d, block, elements, some, authors, began, to, define, the, lanthanides, as, la, yb, and, the, actinides, as, ac, no, matching, the, f, block, the, transactinides, or, superheavy, elements, are, the, short, lived, elements, beyond, the, actinides, starting, at, lawrencium, or, rutherfordium, depending, on, where, the, actinides, are, taken, to, end, many, more, categorizations, exist, and, are, used, according, to, certain, disciplines, in, astrophysics, a, metal, is, defined, as, any, element, with, atomic, number, greater, than, 2, i, e, anything, except, hydrogen, and, helium, the, term, semimetal, has, a, different, definition, in, physics, than, it, does, in, chemistry, bismuth, is, a, semimetal, by, physical, definitions, but, chemists, generally, consider, it, a, metal, a, few, terms, are, widely, used, but, without, any, very, formal, definition, such, as, heavy, metal, which, has, been, given, such, a, wide, range, of, definitions, that, it, has, been, criticized, as, effectively, meaningless, the, scope, of, terms, varies, significantly, between, authors, for, example, according, to, iupac, the, noble, gases, extend, to, include, the, whole, group, including, the, very, radioactive, superheavy, element, oganesson, however, among, those, who, specialize, in, the, superheavy, elements, this, is, not, often, done, in, this, case, noble, gas, is, typically, taken, to, imply, the, unreactive, behaviour, of, the, lighter, elements, of, the, group, since, calculations, generally, predict, that, oganesson, should, not, be, particularly, inert, due, to, relativistic, effects, and, may, not, even, be, a, gas, at, room, temperature, if, it, could, be, produced, in, bulk, its, status, as, a, noble, gas, is, often, questioned, in, this, context, furthermore, national, variations, are, sometimes, encountered, in, japan, alkaline, earth, metals, often, do, not, include, beryllium, and, magnesium, as, their, behaviour, is, different, from, the, heavier, group, 2, metals, in, 1817, german, physicist, johann, wolfgang, d, bereiner, began, to, formulate, one, of, the, earliest, attempts, to, classify, the, elements, in, 1829, he, found, that, he, could, form, some, of, the, elements, into, groups, of, three, with, the, members, of, each, group, having, related, properties, he, termed, these, groups, triads, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, formed, a, triad, as, did, calcium, strontium, and, barium, lithium, sodium, and, potassium, and, sulfur, selenium, and, tellurium, today, all, these, triads, form, part, of, modern, day, groups, the, halogens, alkaline, earth, metals, alkali, metals, and, chalcogens, various, chemists, continued, his, work, and, were, able, to, identify, more, and, more, relationships, between, small, groups, of, elements, however, they, could, not, build, one, scheme, that, encompassed, them, all, john, newlands, published, a, letter, in, the, chemical, news, in, february, 1863, on, the, periodicity, among, the, chemical, elements, in, 1864, newlands, published, an, article, in, the, chemical, news, showing, that, if, the, elements, are, arranged, in, the, order, of, their, atomic, weights, those, having, consecutive, numbers, frequently, either, belong, to, the, same, group, or, occupy, similar, positions, in, different, groups, and, he, pointed, out, that, each, eighth, element, starting, from, a, given, one, is, in, this, arrangement, a, kind, of, repetition, of, the, first, like, the, eighth, note, of, an, octave, in, music, the, law, of, octaves, however, newlands, s, formulation, only, worked, well, for, the, main, group, elements, and, encountered, serious, problems, with, the, others, german, chemist, lothar, meyer, noted, the, sequences, of, similar, chemical, and, physical, properties, repeated, at, periodic, intervals, according, to, him, if, the, atomic, weights, were, plotted, as, ordinates, i, e, vertically, and, the, atomic, volumes, as, abscissas, i, e, horizontally, the, curve, obtained, a, series, of, maximums, and, minimums, the, most, electropositive, elements, would, appear, at, the, peaks, of, the, curve, in, the, order, of, their, atomic, weights, in, 1864, a, book, of, his, was, published, it, contained, an, early, version, of, the, periodic, table, containing, 28, elements, and, classified, elements, into, six, families, by, their, valence, for, the, first, time, elements, had, been, grouped, according, to, their, valence, works, on, organizing, the, elements, by, atomic, weight, had, until, then, been, stymied, by, inaccurate, measurements, of, the, atomic, weights, in, 1868, he, revised, his, table, but, this, revision, was, published, as, a, draft, only, after, his, death, the, definitive, breakthrough, came, from, the, russian, chemist, dmitri, mendeleev, although, other, chemists, including, meyer, had, found, some, other, versions, of, the, periodic, system, at, about, the, same, time, mendeleev, was, the, most, dedicated, to, developing, and, defending, his, system, and, it, was, his, system, that, most, affected, the, scientific, community, on, 17, february, 1869, 1, march, 1869, in, the, gregorian, calendar, mendeleev, began, arranging, the, elements, and, comparing, them, by, their, atomic, weights, he, began, with, a, few, elements, and, over, the, course, of, the, day, his, system, grew, until, it, encompassed, most, of, the, known, elements, after, he, found, a, consistent, arrangement, his, printed, table, appeared, in, may, 1869, in, the, journal, of, the, russian, chemical, society, when, elements, did, not, appear, to, fit, in, the, system, he, boldly, predicted, that, either, valencies, or, atomic, weights, had, been, measured, incorrectly, or, that, there, was, a, missing, element, yet, to, be, discovered, in, 1871, mendeleev, published, a, long, article, including, an, updated, form, of, his, table, that, made, his, predictions, for, unknown, elements, explicit, mendeleev, predicted, the, properties, of, three, of, these, unknown, elements, in, detail, as, they, would, be, missing, heavier, homologues, of, boron, aluminium, and, silicon, he, named, them, eka, boron, eka, aluminium, and, eka, silicon, eka, being, sanskrit, for, one, 45, in, 1875, the, french, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, working, without, knowledge, of, mendeleev, s, prediction, discovered, a, new, element, in, a, sample, of, the, mineral, sphalerite, and, named, it, gallium, he, isolated, the, element, and, began, determining, its, properties, mendeleev, reading, de, boisbaudran, s, publication, sent, a, letter, claiming, that, gallium, was, his, predicted, eka, aluminium, although, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, was, initially, sceptical, and, suspected, that, mendeleev, was, trying, to, take, credit, for, his, discovery, he, later, admitted, that, mendeleev, was, correct, in, 1879, the, swedish, chemist, lars, fredrik, nilson, discovered, a, new, element, which, he, named, scandium, it, turned, out, to, be, eka, boron, eka, silicon, was, found, in, 1886, by, german, chemist, clemens, winkler, who, named, it, germanium, the, properties, of, gallium, scandium, and, germanium, matched, what, mendeleev, had, predicted, in, 1889, mendeleev, noted, at, the, faraday, lecture, to, the, royal, institution, in, london, that, he, had, not, expected, to, live, long, enough, to, mention, their, discovery, to, the, chemical, society, of, great, britain, as, a, confirmation, of, the, exactitude, and, generality, of, the, periodic, law, even, the, discovery, of, the, noble, gases, at, the, close, of, the, 19th, century, which, mendeleev, had, not, predicted, fitted, neatly, into, his, scheme, as, an, eighth, main, group, mendeleev, nevertheless, had, some, trouble, fitting, the, known, lanthanides, into, his, scheme, as, they, did, not, exhibit, the, periodic, change, in, valencies, that, the, other, elements, did, after, much, investigation, the, czech, chemist, bohuslav, brauner, suggested, in, 1902, that, the, lanthanides, could, all, be, placed, together, in, one, group, on, the, periodic, table, he, named, this, the, asteroid, hypothesis, as, an, astronomical, analogy, just, as, there, is, an, asteroid, belt, instead, of, a, single, planet, between, mars, and, jupiter, so, the, place, below, yttrium, was, thought, to, be, occupied, by, all, the, lanthanides, instead, of, just, one, element, after, the, internal, structure, of, the, atom, was, probed, amateur, dutch, physicist, antonius, van, den, broek, proposed, in, 1913, that, the, nuclear, charge, determined, the, placement, of, elements, in, the, periodic, table, the, new, zealand, physicist, ernest, rutherford, coined, the, word, atomic, number, for, this, nuclear, charge, in, van, den, broek, s, published, article, he, illustrated, the, first, electronic, periodic, table, showing, the, elements, arranged, according, to, the, number, of, their, electrons, rutherford, confirmed, in, his, 1914, paper, that, bohr, had, accepted, the, view, of, van, den, broek, the, same, year, english, physicist, henry, moseley, using, x, ray, spectroscopy, confirmed, van, den, broek, s, proposal, experimentally, moseley, determined, the, value, of, the, nuclear, charge, of, each, element, from, aluminium, to, gold, and, showed, that, mendeleev, s, ordering, actually, places, the, elements, in, sequential, order, by, nuclear, charge, nuclear, charge, is, identical, to, proton, count, and, determines, the, value, of, the, atomic, number, z, of, each, element, using, atomic, number, gives, a, definitive, integer, based, sequence, for, the, elements, moseley, s, research, immediately, resolved, discrepancies, between, atomic, weight, and, chemical, properties, these, were, cases, such, as, tellurium, and, iodine, where, atomic, number, increases, but, atomic, weight, decreases, although, moseley, was, soon, killed, in, world, war, i, the, swedish, physicist, manne, siegbahn, continued, his, work, up, to, uranium, and, established, that, it, was, the, element, with, the, highest, atomic, number, then, known, 92, based, on, moseley, and, siegbahn, s, research, it, was, also, known, which, atomic, numbers, corresponded, to, missing, elements, yet, to, be, found, 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and, 87, element, 75, had, in, fact, already, been, found, by, japanese, chemist, masataka, ogawa, in, 1908, and, named, nipponium, but, he, mistakenly, assigned, it, as, element, 43, instead, of, 75, and, so, his, discovery, was, not, generally, recognized, until, later, the, contemporarily, accepted, discovery, of, element, 75, came, in, 1925, when, walter, noddack, ida, tacke, and, otto, berg, independently, rediscovered, it, and, gave, it, its, present, name, rhenium, the, dawn, of, atomic, physics, also, clarified, the, situation, of, isotopes, in, the, decay, chains, of, the, primordial, radioactive, elements, thorium, and, uranium, it, soon, became, evident, that, there, were, many, apparent, new, elements, that, had, different, atomic, weights, but, exactly, the, same, chemical, properties, in, 1913, frederick, soddy, coined, the, term, isotope, to, describe, this, situation, and, considered, isotopes, to, merely, be, different, forms, of, the, same, chemical, element, this, furthermore, clarified, discrepancies, such, as, tellurium, and, iodine, tellurium, s, natural, isotopic, composition, is, weighted, towards, heavier, isotopes, than, iodine, s, but, tellurium, has, a, lower, atomic, number, the, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, applied, max, planck, s, idea, of, quantization, to, the, atom, he, concluded, that, the, energy, levels, of, electrons, were, quantised, only, a, discrete, set, of, stable, energy, states, were, allowed, bohr, then, attempted, to, understand, periodicity, through, electron, configurations, surmising, in, 1913, that, the, inner, electrons, should, be, responsible, for, the, chemical, properties, of, the, element, in, 1913, he, produced, the, first, electronic, periodic, table, based, on, a, quantum, atom, bohr, called, his, electron, shells, rings, in, 1913, atomic, orbitals, within, shells, did, not, exist, at, the, time, of, his, planetary, model, bohr, explains, in, part, 3, of, his, famous, 1913, paper, that, the, maximum, electrons, in, a, shell, is, eight, writing, we, see, further, that, a, ring, of, n, electrons, cannot, rotate, in, a, single, ring, round, a, nucleus, of, charge, ne, unless, n, 8, for, smaller, atoms, the, electron, shells, would, be, filled, as, follows, rings, of, electrons, will, only, join, if, they, contain, equal, numbers, of, electrons, and, that, accordingly, the, numbers, of, electrons, on, inner, rings, will, only, be, 2, 4, 8, however, in, larger, atoms, the, innermost, shell, would, contain, eight, electrons, on, the, other, hand, the, periodic, system, of, the, elements, strongly, suggests, that, already, in, neon, n, 10, an, inner, ring, of, eight, electrons, will, occur, his, proposed, electron, configurations, for, the, atoms, shown, to, the, right, mostly, do, not, accord, with, those, now, known, they, were, improved, further, after, the, work, of, arnold, sommerfeld, and, edmund, stoner, discovered, more, quantum, numbers, the, first, one, to, systematically, expand, and, correct, the, chemical, potentials, of, bohr, s, atomic, theory, was, walther, kossel, in, 1914, and, in, 1916, kossel, explained, that, in, the, periodic, table, new, elements, would, be, created, as, electrons, were, added, to, the, outer, shell, in, kossel, s, paper, he, writes, this, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, the, electrons, which, are, added, further, should, be, put, into, concentric, rings, or, shells, on, each, of, which, only, a, certain, number, of, electrons, namely, eight, in, our, case, should, be, arranged, as, soon, as, one, ring, or, shell, is, completed, a, new, one, has, to, be, started, for, the, next, element, the, number, of, electrons, which, are, most, easily, accessible, and, lie, at, the, outermost, periphery, increases, again, from, element, to, element, and, therefore, in, the, formation, of, each, new, shell, the, chemical, periodicity, is, repeated, in, a, 1919, paper, irving, langmuir, postulated, the, existence, of, cells, which, we, now, call, orbitals, which, could, each, only, contain, two, electrons, each, and, these, were, arranged, in, equidistant, layers, which, we, now, call, shells, he, made, an, exception, for, the, first, shell, to, only, contain, two, electrons, the, chemist, charles, rugeley, bury, suggested, in, 1921, that, eight, and, eighteen, electrons, in, a, shell, form, stable, configurations, bury, proposed, that, the, electron, configurations, in, transitional, elements, depended, upon, the, valence, electrons, in, their, outer, shell, he, introduced, the, word, transition, to, describe, the, elements, now, known, as, transition, metals, or, transition, elements, bohr, s, theory, was, vindicated, by, the, discovery, of, element, 72, georges, urbain, claimed, to, have, discovered, it, as, the, rare, earth, element, celtium, but, bury, and, bohr, had, predicted, that, element, 72, could, not, be, a, rare, earth, element, and, had, to, be, a, homologue, of, zirconium, dirk, coster, and, georg, von, hevesy, searched, for, the, element, in, zirconium, ores, and, found, element, 72, which, they, named, hafnium, after, bohr, s, hometown, of, copenhagen, hafnia, in, latin, urbain, s, celtium, proved, to, be, simply, purified, lutetium, element, 71, hafnium, and, rhenium, thus, became, the, last, stable, elements, to, be, discovered, prompted, by, bohr, wolfgang, pauli, took, up, the, problem, of, electron, configurations, in, 1923, pauli, extended, bohr, s, scheme, to, use, four, quantum, numbers, and, formulated, his, exclusion, principle, which, stated, that, no, two, electrons, could, have, the, same, four, quantum, numbers, this, explained, the, lengths, of, the, periods, in, the, periodic, table, 2, 8, 18, and, 32, which, corresponded, to, the, number, of, electrons, that, each, shell, could, occupy, in, 1925, friedrich, hund, arrived, at, configurations, close, to, the, modern, ones, as, a, result, of, these, advances, periodicity, became, based, on, the, number, of, chemically, active, or, valence, electrons, rather, than, by, the, valences, of, the, elements, the, aufbau, principle, that, describes, the, electron, configurations, of, the, elements, was, first, empirically, observed, by, erwin, madelung, in, 1926, though, the, first, to, publish, it, was, vladimir, karapetoff, in, 1930, in, 1961, vsevolod, klechkovsky, derived, the, first, part, of, the, madelung, rule, that, orbitals, fill, in, order, of, increasing, n, from, the, thomas, fermi, model, the, complete, rule, was, derived, from, a, similar, potential, in, 1971, by, yury, n, demkov, and, valentin, n, ostrovsky, the, quantum, theory, clarified, the, transition, metals, and, lanthanides, as, forming, their, own, separate, groups, transitional, between, the, main, groups, although, some, chemists, had, already, proposed, tables, showing, them, this, way, before, then, the, english, chemist, henry, bassett, did, so, in, 1892, the, danish, chemist, julius, thomsen, in, 1895, and, the, swiss, chemist, alfred, werner, in, 1905, bohr, used, thomsen, s, form, in, his, 1922, nobel, lecture, werner, s, form, is, very, similar, to, the, modern, 32, column, form, in, particular, this, supplanted, brauner, s, asteroidal, hypothesis, the, exact, position, of, the, lanthanides, and, thus, the, composition, of, group, 3, remained, under, dispute, for, decades, longer, because, their, electron, configurations, were, initially, measured, incorrectly, on, chemical, grounds, bassett, werner, and, bury, grouped, scandium, and, yttrium, with, lutetium, rather, than, lanthanum, the, former, two, left, an, empty, space, below, yttrium, as, lutetium, had, not, yet, been, discovered, hund, assumed, in, 1927, that, all, the, lanthanide, atoms, had, configuration, 4f, 0, 14, 5d, 1, 6s, 2, on, account, of, their, prevailing, trivalency, it, is, now, known, that, the, relationship, between, chemistry, and, electron, configuration, is, more, complicated, than, that, early, spectroscopic, evidence, seemed, to, confirm, these, configurations, and, thus, the, periodic, table, was, structured, to, have, group, 3, as, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and, actinium, with, fourteen, f, elements, breaking, up, the, d, block, between, lanthanum, and, hafnium, but, it, was, later, discovered, that, this, is, only, true, for, four, of, the, fifteen, lanthanides, lanthanum, cerium, gadolinium, and, lutetium, and, that, the, other, lanthanide, atoms, do, not, have, a, d, electron, in, particular, ytterbium, completes, the, 4f, shell, and, thus, soviet, physicists, lev, landau, and, evgeny, lifshitz, noted, in, 1948, that, lutetium, is, correctly, regarded, as, a, d, block, rather, than, an, f, block, element, that, bulk, lanthanum, is, an, f, metal, was, first, suggested, by, jun, kond, in, 1963, on, the, grounds, of, its, low, temperature, superconductivity, this, clarified, the, importance, of, looking, at, low, lying, excited, states, of, atoms, that, can, play, a, role, in, chemical, environments, when, classifying, elements, by, block, and, positioning, them, on, the, table, many, authors, subsequently, rediscovered, this, correction, based, on, physical, chemical, and, electronic, concerns, and, applied, it, to, all, the, relevant, elements, thus, making, group, 3, contain, scandium, yttrium, lutetium, and, lawrencium, and, having, lanthanum, through, ytterbium, and, actinium, through, nobelium, as, the, f, block, rows, this, corrected, version, achieves, consistency, with, the, madelung, rule, and, vindicates, bassett, werner, and, bury, s, initial, chemical, placement, in, 1988, iupac, released, a, report, supporting, this, composition, of, group, 3, a, decision, that, was, reaffirmed, in, 2021, variation, can, still, be, found, in, textbooks, on, the, composition, of, group, 3, and, some, argumentation, against, this, format, is, still, published, today, but, chemists, and, physicists, who, have, considered, the, matter, largely, agree, on, group, 3, containing, scandium, yttrium, lutetium, and, lawrencium, and, challenge, the, counterarguments, as, being, inconsistent, by, 1936, the, pool, of, missing, elements, from, hydrogen, to, uranium, had, shrunk, to, four, elements, 43, 61, 85, and, 87, remained, missing, element, 43, eventually, became, the, first, element, to, be, synthesized, artificially, via, nuclear, reactions, rather, than, discovered, in, nature, it, was, discovered, in, 1937, by, italian, chemists, emilio, segr, and, carlo, perrier, who, named, their, discovery, technetium, after, the, greek, word, for, artificial, elements, 61, promethium, and, 85, astatine, were, likewise, produced, artificially, in, 1945, and, 1940, respectively, element, 87, francium, became, the, last, element, to, be, discovered, in, nature, by, french, chemist, marguerite, perey, in, 1939, the, elements, beyond, uranium, were, likewise, discovered, artificially, starting, with, edwin, mcmillan, and, philip, abelson, s, 1940, discovery, of, neptunium, via, bombardment, of, uranium, with, neutrons, glenn, t, seaborg, and, his, team, at, the, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, lbnl, continued, discovering, transuranium, elements, starting, with, plutonium, in, 1941, and, discovered, that, contrary, to, previous, thinking, the, elements, from, actinium, onwards, were, congeners, of, the, lanthanides, rather, than, transition, metals, bassett, 1892, werner, 1905, and, the, french, engineer, charles, janet, 1928, had, previously, suggested, this, but, their, ideas, did, not, then, receive, general, acceptance, seaborg, thus, called, them, the, actinides, elements, up, to, 101, named, mendelevium, in, honour, of, mendeleev, were, synthesized, up, to, 1955, either, through, neutron, or, alpha, particle, irradiation, or, in, nuclear, explosions, in, the, cases, of, 99, einsteinium, and, 100, fermium, a, significant, controversy, arose, with, elements, 102, through, 106, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, competition, arose, between, the, lbnl, team, now, led, by, albert, ghiorso, and, a, team, of, soviet, scientists, at, the, joint, institute, for, nuclear, research, jinr, led, by, georgy, flyorov, each, team, claimed, discovery, and, in, some, cases, each, proposed, their, own, name, for, the, element, creating, an, element, naming, controversy, that, lasted, decades, these, elements, were, made, by, bombardment, of, actinides, with, light, ions, iupac, at, first, adopted, a, hands, off, approach, preferring, to, wait, and, see, if, a, consensus, would, be, forthcoming, but, as, it, was, also, the, height, of, the, cold, war, it, became, clear, that, this, would, not, happen, as, such, iupac, and, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, physics, iupap, created, a, transfermium, working, group, twg, fermium, being, element, 100, in, 1985, to, set, out, criteria, for, discovery, which, were, published, in, 1991, after, some, further, controversy, these, elements, received, their, final, names, in, 1997, including, seaborgium, 106, in, honour, of, seaborg, the, twg, s, criteria, were, used, to, arbitrate, later, element, discovery, claims, from, lbnl, and, jinr, as, well, as, from, research, institutes, in, germany, gsi, and, japan, riken, currently, consideration, of, discovery, claims, is, performed, by, a, iupac, iupap, joint, working, party, after, priority, was, assigned, the, elements, were, officially, added, to, the, periodic, table, and, the, discoverers, were, invited, to, propose, their, names, by, 2016, this, had, occurred, for, all, elements, up, to, 118, therefore, completing, the, periodic, table, s, first, seven, rows, the, discoveries, of, elements, beyond, 106, were, made, possible, by, techniques, devised, by, yuri, oganessian, at, the, jinr, cold, fusion, bombardment, of, lead, and, bismuth, by, heavy, ions, made, possible, the, 1981, 2004, discoveries, of, elements, 107, through, 112, at, gsi, and, 113, at, riken, and, he, led, the, jinr, team, in, collaboration, with, american, scientists, to, discover, elements, 114, through, 118, using, hot, fusion, bombardment, of, actinides, by, calcium, ions, in, 1998, 2010, the, heaviest, known, element, oganesson, 118, is, named, in, oganessian, s, honour, element, 114, is, named, flerovium, in, honour, of, his, predecessor, and, mentor, flyorov, in, celebration, of, the, periodic, table, s, 150th, anniversary, the, united, nations, declared, the, year, 2019, as, the, international, year, of, the, periodic, table, celebrating, one, of, the, most, significant, achievements, in, science, the, discovery, criteria, set, down, by, the, twg, were, updated, in, 2020, in, response, to, experimental, and, theoretical, progress, that, had, not, been, foreseen, in, 1991, today, the, periodic, table, is, among, the, most, recognisable, icons, of, chemistry, iupac, is, involved, today, with, many, processes, relating, to, the, periodic, table, the, recognition, and, naming, of, new, elements, recommending, group, numbers, and, collective, names, and, the, updating, of, atomic, weights, the, most, recently, named, elements, nihonium, 113, moscovium, 115, tennessine, 117, and, oganesson, 118, completed, the, seventh, row, of, the, periodic, table, future, elements, would, have, to, begin, an, eighth, row, these, elements, may, be, referred, to, either, by, their, atomic, numbers, e, g, element, 119, or, by, the, iupac, systematic, element, names, adopted, in, 1978, which, directly, relate, to, the, atomic, numbers, e, g, ununennium, for, element, 119, derived, from, latin, unus, one, greek, ennea, nine, and, the, traditional, ium, suffix, for, metallic, elements, all, attempts, to, synthesize, such, elements, have, failed, so, far, an, attempt, to, make, element, 119, has, been, ongoing, since, 2018, at, the, riken, research, institute, in, japan, the, lbnl, in, the, united, states, the, jinr, in, russia, and, the, heavy, ion, research, facility, in, lanzhou, hirfl, in, china, also, plan, to, make, their, own, attempts, at, synthesizing, the, first, few, period, 8, elements, if, the, eighth, period, followed, the, pattern, set, by, the, earlier, periods, then, it, would, contain, fifty, elements, filling, the, 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, and, finally, 8p, subshells, in, that, order, but, by, this, point, relativistic, effects, should, result, in, significant, deviations, from, the, madelung, rule, various, different, models, have, been, suggested, for, the, configurations, of, eighth, period, elements, as, well, as, how, to, show, the, results, in, a, periodic, table, all, agree, that, the, eighth, period, should, begin, like, the, previous, ones, with, two, 8s, elements, 119, and, 120, however, after, that, the, massive, energetic, overlaps, between, the, 5g, 6f, 7d, and, 8p, subshells, means, that, they, all, begin, to, fill, together, and, it, is, not, clear, how, to, separate, out, specific, 5g, and, 6f, series, elements, 121, through, 156, thus, do, not, fit, well, as, chemical, analogues, of, any, previous, group, in, the, earlier, parts, of, the, table, although, they, have, sometimes, been, placed, as, 5g, 6f, and, other, series, to, formally, reflect, their, electron, configurations, eric, scerri, has, raised, the, question, of, whether, an, extended, periodic, table, should, take, into, account, the, failure, of, the, madelung, rule, in, this, region, or, if, such, exceptions, should, be, ignored, the, shell, structure, may, also, be, fairly, formal, at, this, point, already, the, electron, distribution, in, an, oganesson, atom, is, expected, to, be, rather, uniform, with, no, discernible, shell, structure, the, situation, from, elements, 157, to, 172, should, return, to, normalcy, and, be, more, reminiscent, of, the, earlier, rows, the, heavy, p, shells, are, split, by, the, spin, orbit, interaction, one, p, orbital, p, 1, 2, is, more, stabilized, and, the, other, two, p, 3, 2, are, destabilized, such, shifts, in, the, quantum, numbers, happen, for, all, types, of, shells, but, it, makes, the, biggest, difference, to, the, order, for, the, p, shells, it, is, likely, that, by, element, 157, the, filled, 8s, and, 8p, 1, 2, shells, with, four, electrons, in, total, have, sunk, into, the, core, beyond, the, core, the, next, orbitals, are, 7d, and, 9s, at, similar, energies, followed, by, 9p, 1, 2, and, 8p, 3, 2, at, similar, energies, and, then, a, large, gap, thus, the, 9s, and, 9p, 1, 2, orbitals, in, essence, replace, the, 8s, and, 8p, 1, 2, ones, making, elements, 157, 172, probably, chemically, analogous, to, groups, 3, 18, for, example, element, 164, would, appear, two, places, below, lead, in, group, 14, under, the, usual, pattern, but, is, calculated, to, be, very, analogous, to, palladium, in, group, 10, instead, thus, it, takes, fifty, four, elements, rather, than, fifty, to, reach, the, next, noble, element, after, 118, however, while, these, conclusions, about, elements, 157, through, 172, s, chemistry, are, generally, agreed, by, models, there, is, disagreement, on, whether, the, periodic, table, should, be, drawn, to, reflect, chemical, analogies, or, if, it, should, reflect, likely, formal, electron, configurations, which, should, be, quite, different, from, earlier, periods, and, are, not, agreed, between, sources, discussion, about, the, format, of, the, eighth, row, thus, continues, beyond, element, 172, calculation, is, complicated, by, the, 1s, electron, energy, level, becoming, imaginary, such, a, situation, does, have, physical, interpretation, and, does, not, in, itself, pose, an, electronic, limit, to, the, periodic, table, but, the, correct, way, to, incorporate, such, states, into, multi, electron, calculations, is, still, an, open, problem, this, would, need, to, be, solved, to, continue, calculating, the, periodic, table, s, structure, beyond, this, point, nuclear, stability, will, likely, prove, a, decisive, factor, constraining, the, number, of, possible, elements, it, depends, on, the, balance, between, the, electric, repulsion, between, protons, and, the, strong, force, binding, protons, and, neutrons, together, protons, and, neutrons, are, arranged, in, shells, just, like, electrons, and, so, a, closed, shell, can, significantly, increase, stability, the, known, superheavy, nuclei, exist, because, of, such, a, shell, closure, probably, at, around, 114, 126, protons, and, 184, neutrons, they, are, probably, close, to, a, predicted, island, of, stability, where, superheavy, nuclides, should, be, more, long, lived, than, expected, predictions, for, the, longest, lived, nuclides, on, the, island, range, from, microseconds, to, millions, of, years, it, should, nonetheless, be, noted, that, these, are, essentially, extrapolations, into, an, unknown, part, of, the, chart, of, nuclides, and, systematic, model, uncertainties, need, to, be, taken, into, account, as, the, closed, shells, are, passed, the, stabilizing, effect, should, vanish, thus, superheavy, nuclides, with, more, than, 184, neutrons, are, expected, to, have, much, shorter, lifetimes, spontaneously, fissioning, within, 10, 15, seconds, if, this, is, so, then, it, would, not, make, sense, to, consider, them, chemical, elements, iupac, defines, an, element, to, exist, only, if, the, nucleus, lives, longer, than, 10, 14, seconds, the, time, needed, for, it, to, gather, an, electron, cloud, nonetheless, theoretical, estimates, of, half, lives, are, very, model, dependent, ranging, over, many, orders, of, magnitude, the, extreme, repulsion, between, protons, is, predicted, to, result, in, exotic, nuclear, topologies, with, bubbles, rings, and, tori, expected, this, further, complicates, extrapolation, it, is, not, clear, if, any, further, out, shell, closures, exist, due, to, an, expected, smearing, out, of, distinct, nuclear, shells, as, is, already, expected, for, the, electron, shells, at, oganesson, furthermore, even, if, later, shell, closures, exist, it, is, not, clear, if, they, would, allow, such, heavy, elements, to, exist, as, such, it, may, be, that, the, periodic, table, practically, ends, around, element, 120, as, elements, become, too, short, lived, to, observe, and, then, too, short, lived, to, have, chemistry, the, era, of, discovering, new, elements, would, thus, be, close, to, its, end, if, another, proton, shell, closure, beyond, 126, does, exist, then, it, probably, occurs, around, 164, thus, the, region, where, periodicity, fails, more, or, less, matches, the, region, of, instability, between, the, shell, closures, alternatively, quark, matter, may, become, stable, at, high, mass, numbers, in, which, the, nucleus, is, composed, of, freely, flowing, up, and, down, quarks, instead, of, binding, them, into, protons, and, neutrons, this, would, create, a, continent, of, stability, instead, of, an, island, other, effects, may, come, into, play, for, example, in, very, heavy, elements, the, 1s, electrons, are, likely, to, spend, a, significant, amount, of, time, so, close, to, the, nucleus, that, they, are, actually, inside, it, which, would, make, them, vulnerable, to, electron, capture, even, if, eighth, row, elements, can, exist, producing, them, is, likely, to, be, difficult, and, it, should, become, even, more, difficult, as, atomic, number, rises, although, the, 8s, elements, 119, and, 120, are, expected, to, be, reachable, with, present, means, the, elements, beyond, that, are, expected, to, require, new, technology, if, they, can, be, produced, at, all, experimentally, characterizing, these, elements, chemically, would, also, pose, a, great, challenge, the, periodic, law, may, be, represented, in, multiple, ways, of, which, the, standard, periodic, table, is, only, one, within, 100, years, of, the, appearance, of, mendeleev, s, table, in, 1869, edward, g, mazurs, had, collected, an, estimated, 700, different, published, versions, of, the, periodic, table, many, forms, retain, the, rectangular, structure, including, charles, janet, s, left, step, periodic, table, pictured, below, and, the, modernised, form, of, mendeleev, s, original, 8, column, layout, that, is, still, common, in, russia, other, periodic, table, formats, have, been, shaped, much, more, exotically, such, as, spirals, otto, theodor, benfey, s, pictured, to, the, right, circles, and, triangles, alternative, periodic, tables, are, often, developed, to, highlight, or, emphasize, chemical, or, physical, properties, of, the, elements, that, are, not, as, apparent, in, traditional, periodic, tables, with, different, ones, skewed, more, towards, emphasizing, chemistry, or, physics, at, either, end, the, standard, form, which, remains, by, far, the, most, common, is, somewhere, in, the, middle, the, many, different, forms, of, the, periodic, table, have, prompted, the, questions, of, whether, there, is, an, optimal, or, definitive, form, of, the, periodic, table, and, if, so, what, it, might, be, there, are, no, current, consensus, answers, to, either, question, janet, s, left, step, table, is, being, increasingly, discussed, as, a, candidate, for, being, the, optimal, or, most, fundamental, form, scerri, has, written, in, support, of, it, as, it, clarifies, helium, s, nature, as, an, s, block, element, increases, regularity, by, having, all, period, lengths, repeated, faithfully, follows, madelung, s, rule, by, making, each, period, correspond, to, one, value, of, n, and, regularises, atomic, number, triads, and, the, first, row, anomaly, trend, while, he, notes, that, its, placement, of, helium, atop, the, alkaline, earth, metals, can, be, seen, a, disadvantage, from, a, chemical, perspective, he, counters, this, by, appealing, to, the, first, row, anomaly, pointing, out, that, the, periodic, table, fundamentally, reduces, to, quantum, mechanics, and, that, it, is, concerned, with, abstract, elements, and, hence, atomic, properties, rather, than, macroscopic, properties
