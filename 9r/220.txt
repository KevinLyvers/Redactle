in, physical, cosmology, cosmic, inflation, cosmological, inflation, or, just, inflation, is, a, theory, of, exponential, expansion, of, space, in, the, very, early, universe, following, the, inflationary, period, the, universe, continued, to, expand, but, at, a, slower, rate, the, re, acceleration, of, this, slowing, expansion, due, to, dark, energy, began, after, the, universe, was, already, over, 7, 7, billion, years, old, 5, 4, billion, years, ago, inflation, theory, was, developed, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, with, notable, contributions, by, several, theoretical, physicists, including, alexei, starobinsky, at, landau, institute, for, theoretical, physics, alan, guth, at, cornell, university, and, andrei, linde, at, lebedev, physical, institute, starobinsky, guth, and, linde, won, the, 2014, kavli, prize, for, pioneering, the, theory, of, cosmic, inflation, it, was, developed, further, in, the, early, 1980s, it, explains, the, origin, of, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, cosmos, quantum, fluctuations, in, the, microscopic, inflationary, region, magnified, to, cosmic, size, become, the, seeds, for, the, growth, of, structure, in, the, universe, see, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, and, structure, formation, many, physicists, also, believe, that, inflation, explains, why, the, universe, appears, to, be, the, same, in, all, directions, isotropic, why, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, is, distributed, evenly, why, the, universe, is, flat, and, why, no, magnetic, monopoles, have, been, observed, the, detailed, particle, physics, mechanism, responsible, for, inflation, is, unknown, the, basic, inflationary, paradigm, is, accepted, by, most, physicists, as, a, number, of, inflation, model, predictions, have, been, confirmed, by, observation, however, a, substantial, minority, of, scientists, dissent, from, this, position, the, hypothetical, field, thought, to, be, responsible, for, inflation, is, called, the, inflaton, in, 2002, three, of, the, original, architects, of, the, theory, were, recognized, for, their, major, contributions, physicists, alan, guth, of, m, i, t, andrei, linde, of, stanford, and, paul, steinhardt, of, princeton, shared, the, dirac, prize, for, development, of, the, concept, of, inflation, in, cosmology, in, 2012, guth, and, linde, were, awarded, the, breakthrough, prize, in, fundamental, physics, for, their, invention, and, development, of, inflationary, cosmology, around, 1930, edwin, hubble, discovered, that, light, from, remote, galaxies, was, redshifted, the, more, remote, the, more, shifted, this, implies, that, the, galaxies, are, receding, from, the, earth, with, more, distant, galaxies, receding, more, rapidly, such, that, galaxies, also, recede, from, each, other, this, expansion, of, the, universe, was, previously, predicted, by, alexander, friedmann, and, georges, lema, tre, from, the, theory, of, general, relativity, it, can, be, understood, as, a, consequence, of, an, initial, impulse, which, sent, the, contents, of, the, universe, flying, apart, at, such, a, rate, that, their, mutual, gravitational, attraction, has, not, reversed, their, increasing, separation, inflation, may, have, provided, this, initial, impulse, according, to, the, friedmann, equations, that, describe, the, dynamics, of, an, expanding, universe, a, fluid, with, sufficiently, negative, pressure, exerts, gravitational, repulsion, in, the, cosmological, context, a, field, in, a, positive, energy, false, vacuum, state, could, represent, such, a, fluid, and, the, resulting, repulsion, would, set, the, universe, into, exponential, expansion, this, inflation, phase, was, originally, proposed, by, alan, guth, in, 1979, because, the, exponential, expansion, could, dilute, exotic, relics, such, as, magnetic, monopoles, that, were, predicted, by, grand, unified, theories, at, the, time, this, would, explain, why, such, relics, were, not, seen, it, was, quickly, realized, that, such, accelerated, expansion, would, resolve, the, horizon, problem, and, the, flatness, problem, these, problems, arise, from, the, notion, that, to, look, like, it, does, today, the, universe, must, have, started, from, very, finely, tuned, or, special, initial, conditions, at, the, big, bang, an, expanding, universe, generally, has, a, cosmological, horizon, which, by, analogy, with, the, more, familiar, horizon, caused, by, the, curvature, of, earth, s, surface, marks, the, boundary, of, the, part, of, the, universe, that, an, observer, can, see, light, or, other, radiation, emitted, by, objects, beyond, the, cosmological, horizon, in, an, accelerating, universe, never, reaches, the, observer, because, the, space, in, between, the, observer, and, the, object, is, expanding, too, rapidly, the, observable, universe, is, one, causal, patch, of, a, much, larger, unobservable, universe, other, parts, of, the, universe, cannot, communicate, with, earth, yet, these, parts, of, the, universe, are, outside, our, current, cosmological, horizon, which, is, believed, to, be, 46, billion, light, years, in, all, directions, from, earth, in, the, standard, hot, big, bang, model, without, inflation, the, cosmological, horizon, moves, out, bringing, new, regions, into, view, yet, as, a, local, observer, sees, such, a, region, for, the, first, time, it, looks, no, different, from, any, other, region, of, space, the, local, observer, has, already, seen, its, background, radiation, is, at, nearly, the, same, temperature, as, the, background, radiation, of, other, regions, and, its, space, time, curvature, is, evolving, lock, step, with, the, others, this, presents, a, mystery, how, did, these, new, regions, know, what, temperature, and, curvature, they, were, supposed, to, have, they, could, not, have, learned, it, by, getting, signals, because, they, were, not, previously, in, communication, with, our, past, light, cone, inflation, answers, this, question, by, postulating, that, all, the, regions, come, from, an, earlier, era, with, a, big, vacuum, energy, or, cosmological, constant, a, space, with, a, cosmological, constant, is, qualitatively, different, instead, of, moving, outward, the, cosmological, horizon, stays, put, for, any, one, observer, the, distance, to, the, cosmological, horizon, is, constant, with, exponentially, expanding, space, two, nearby, observers, are, separated, very, quickly, so, much, so, that, the, distance, between, them, quickly, exceeds, the, limits, of, communication, the, spatial, slices, are, expanding, very, fast, to, cover, huge, volumes, things, are, constantly, moving, beyond, the, cosmological, horizon, which, is, a, fixed, distance, away, and, everything, becomes, homogeneous, as, the, inflationary, field, slowly, relaxes, to, the, vacuum, the, cosmological, constant, goes, to, zero, and, space, begins, to, expand, normally, the, new, regions, that, come, into, view, during, the, normal, expansion, phase, are, exactly, the, same, regions, that, were, pushed, out, of, the, horizon, during, inflation, and, so, they, are, at, nearly, the, same, temperature, and, curvature, because, they, come, from, the, same, originally, small, patch, of, space, the, theory, of, inflation, thus, explains, why, the, temperatures, and, curvatures, of, different, regions, are, so, nearly, equal, it, also, predicts, that, the, total, curvature, of, a, space, slice, at, constant, global, time, is, zero, this, prediction, implies, that, the, total, ordinary, matter, dark, matter, and, residual, vacuum, energy, in, the, universe, have, to, add, up, to, the, critical, density, and, the, evidence, supports, this, more, strikingly, inflation, allows, physicists, to, calculate, the, minute, differences, in, temperature, of, different, regions, from, quantum, fluctuations, during, the, inflationary, era, and, many, of, these, quantitative, predictions, have, been, confirmed, in, a, space, that, expands, exponentially, or, nearly, exponentially, with, time, any, pair, of, free, floating, objects, that, are, initially, at, rest, will, move, apart, from, each, other, at, an, accelerating, rate, at, least, as, long, as, they, are, not, bound, together, by, any, force, from, the, point, of, view, of, one, such, object, the, spacetime, is, something, like, an, inside, out, schwarzschild, black, hole, each, object, is, surrounded, by, a, spherical, event, horizon, once, the, other, object, has, fallen, through, this, horizon, it, can, never, return, and, even, light, signals, it, sends, will, never, reach, the, first, object, at, least, so, long, as, the, space, continues, to, expand, exponentially, in, the, approximation, that, the, expansion, is, exactly, exponential, the, horizon, is, static, and, remains, a, fixed, physical, distance, away, this, patch, of, an, inflating, universe, can, be, described, by, the, following, metric, this, exponentially, expanding, spacetime, is, called, a, de, sitter, space, and, to, sustain, it, there, must, be, a, cosmological, constant, a, vacuum, energy, density, that, is, constant, in, space, and, time, and, proportional, to, in, the, above, metric, for, the, case, of, exactly, exponential, expansion, the, vacuum, energy, has, a, negative, pressure, p, equal, in, magnitude, to, its, energy, density, the, equation, of, state, is, p, inflation, is, typically, not, an, exactly, exponential, expansion, but, rather, quasi, or, near, exponential, in, such, a, universe, the, horizon, will, slowly, grow, with, time, as, the, vacuum, energy, density, gradually, decreases, because, the, accelerating, expansion, of, space, stretches, out, any, initial, variations, in, density, or, temperature, to, very, large, length, scales, an, essential, feature, of, inflation, is, that, it, smooths, out, inhomogeneities, and, anisotropies, and, reduces, the, curvature, of, space, this, pushes, the, universe, into, a, very, simple, state, in, which, it, is, completely, dominated, by, the, inflaton, field, and, the, only, significant, inhomogeneities, are, tiny, quantum, fluctuations, inflation, also, dilutes, exotic, heavy, particles, such, as, the, magnetic, monopoles, predicted, by, many, extensions, to, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, if, the, universe, was, only, hot, enough, to, form, such, particles, before, a, period, of, inflation, they, would, not, be, observed, in, nature, as, they, would, be, so, rare, that, it, is, quite, likely, that, there, are, none, in, the, observable, universe, together, these, effects, are, called, the, inflationary, no, hair, theorem, by, analogy, with, the, no, hair, theorem, for, black, holes, the, no, hair, theorem, works, essentially, because, the, cosmological, horizon, is, no, different, from, a, black, hole, horizon, except, for, not, testable, disagreements, about, what, is, on, the, other, side, the, interpretation, of, the, no, hair, theorem, is, that, the, universe, observable, and, unobservable, expands, by, an, enormous, factor, during, inflation, in, an, expanding, universe, energy, densities, generally, fall, or, get, diluted, as, the, volume, of, the, universe, increases, for, example, the, density, of, ordinary, cold, matter, dust, declines, as, the, inverse, of, the, volume, when, linear, dimensions, double, the, energy, density, declines, by, a, factor, of, eight, the, radiation, energy, density, declines, even, more, rapidly, as, the, universe, expands, since, the, wavelength, of, each, photon, is, stretched, redshifted, in, addition, to, the, photons, being, dispersed, by, the, expansion, when, linear, dimensions, are, doubled, the, energy, density, in, radiation, falls, by, a, factor, of, sixteen, see, the, solution, of, the, energy, density, continuity, equation, for, an, ultra, relativistic, fluid, during, inflation, the, energy, density, in, the, inflaton, field, is, roughly, constant, however, the, energy, density, in, everything, else, including, inhomogeneities, curvature, anisotropies, exotic, particles, and, standard, model, particles, is, falling, and, through, sufficient, inflation, these, all, become, negligible, this, leaves, the, universe, flat, and, symmetric, and, apart, from, the, homogeneous, inflaton, field, mostly, empty, at, the, moment, inflation, ends, and, reheating, begins, inflation, is, a, period, of, supercooled, expansion, when, the, temperature, drops, by, a, factor, of, 100, 000, or, so, the, exact, drop, is, model, dependent, but, in, the, first, models, it, was, typically, from, 10, 27, k, down, to, 10, 22, k, this, relatively, low, temperature, is, maintained, during, the, inflationary, phase, when, inflation, ends, the, temperature, returns, to, the, pre, inflationary, temperature, this, is, called, reheating, or, thermalization, because, the, large, potential, energy, of, the, inflaton, field, decays, into, particles, and, fills, the, universe, with, standard, model, particles, including, electromagnetic, radiation, starting, the, radiation, dominated, phase, of, the, universe, because, the, nature, of, the, inflaton, field, is, not, known, this, process, is, still, poorly, understood, although, it, is, believed, to, take, place, through, a, parametric, resonance, inflation, tries, to, resolve, several, problems, in, big, bang, cosmology, that, were, discovered, in, the, 1970s, inflation, was, first, proposed, by, alan, guth, in, 1979, while, investigating, the, problem, of, why, no, magnetic, monopoles, are, seen, today, he, found, that, a, positive, energy, false, vacuum, would, according, to, general, relativity, generate, an, exponential, expansion, of, space, it, was, quickly, realised, that, such, an, expansion, would, resolve, many, other, long, standing, problems, these, problems, arise, from, the, observation, that, to, look, like, it, does, today, the, universe, would, have, to, have, started, from, very, finely, tuned, or, special, initial, conditions, at, the, big, bang, inflation, attempts, to, resolve, these, problems, by, providing, a, dynamical, mechanism, that, drives, the, universe, to, this, special, state, thus, making, a, universe, like, ours, much, more, likely, in, the, context, of, the, big, bang, theory, the, horizon, problem, is, the, problem, of, determining, why, the, universe, appears, statistically, homogeneous, and, isotropic, in, accordance, with, the, cosmological, principle, for, example, molecules, in, a, canister, of, gas, are, distributed, homogeneously, and, isotropically, because, they, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, gas, throughout, the, canister, has, had, enough, time, to, interact, to, dissipate, inhomogeneities, and, anisotropies, the, situation, is, quite, different, in, the, big, bang, model, without, inflation, because, gravitational, expansion, does, not, give, the, early, universe, enough, time, to, equilibrate, in, a, big, bang, with, only, the, matter, and, radiation, known, in, the, standard, model, two, widely, separated, regions, of, the, observable, universe, cannot, have, equilibrated, because, they, move, apart, from, each, other, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, and, thus, have, never, come, into, causal, contact, in, the, early, universe, it, was, not, possible, to, send, a, light, signal, between, the, two, regions, because, they, have, had, no, interaction, it, is, difficult, to, explain, why, they, have, the, same, temperature, are, thermally, equilibrated, historically, proposed, solutions, included, the, phoenix, universe, of, georges, lema, tre, the, related, oscillatory, universe, of, richard, chase, tolman, and, the, mixmaster, universe, of, charles, misner, lema, tre, and, tolman, proposed, that, a, universe, undergoing, a, number, of, cycles, of, contraction, and, expansion, could, come, into, thermal, equilibrium, their, models, failed, however, because, of, the, buildup, of, entropy, over, several, cycles, misner, made, the, ultimately, incorrect, conjecture, that, the, mixmaster, mechanism, which, made, the, universe, more, chaotic, could, lead, to, statistical, homogeneity, and, isotropy, the, flatness, problem, is, sometimes, called, one, of, the, dicke, coincidences, along, with, the, cosmological, constant, problem, it, became, known, in, the, 1960s, that, the, density, of, matter, in, the, universe, was, comparable, to, the, critical, density, necessary, for, a, flat, universe, that, is, a, universe, whose, large, scale, geometry, is, the, usual, euclidean, geometry, rather, than, a, non, euclidean, hyperbolic, or, spherical, geometry, p, 61, therefore, regardless, of, the, shape, of, the, universe, the, contribution, of, spatial, curvature, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, could, not, be, much, greater, than, the, contribution, of, matter, but, as, the, universe, expands, the, curvature, redshifts, away, more, slowly, than, matter, and, radiation, extrapolated, into, the, past, this, presents, a, fine, tuning, problem, because, the, contribution, of, curvature, to, the, universe, must, be, exponentially, small, sixteen, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, the, density, of, radiation, at, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, for, example, this, problem, is, exacerbated, by, recent, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, that, have, demonstrated, that, the, universe, is, flat, to, within, a, few, percent, the, magnetic, monopole, problem, sometimes, called, the, exotic, relics, problem, says, that, if, the, early, universe, were, very, hot, a, large, number, of, very, heavy, stable, magnetic, monopoles, would, have, been, produced, stable, magnetic, monopoles, are, a, problem, for, grand, unified, theories, which, propose, that, at, high, temperatures, such, as, in, the, early, universe, the, electromagnetic, force, strong, and, weak, nuclear, forces, are, not, actually, fundamental, forces, but, arise, due, to, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, from, a, single, gauge, theory, these, theories, predict, a, number, of, heavy, stable, particles, that, have, not, been, observed, in, nature, the, most, notorious, is, the, magnetic, monopole, a, kind, of, stable, heavy, charge, of, magnetic, field, monopoles, are, predicted, to, be, copiously, produced, following, grand, unified, theories, at, high, temperature, and, they, should, have, persisted, to, the, present, day, to, such, an, extent, that, they, would, become, the, primary, constituent, of, the, universe, not, only, is, that, not, the, case, but, all, searches, for, them, have, failed, placing, stringent, limits, on, the, density, of, relic, magnetic, monopoles, in, the, universe, a, period, of, inflation, that, occurs, below, the, temperature, where, magnetic, monopoles, can, be, produced, would, offer, a, possible, resolution, of, this, problem, monopoles, would, be, separated, from, each, other, as, the, universe, around, them, expands, potentially, lowering, their, observed, density, by, many, orders, of, magnitude, though, as, cosmologist, martin, rees, has, written, in, the, early, days, of, general, relativity, albert, einstein, introduced, the, cosmological, constant, to, allow, a, static, solution, which, was, a, three, dimensional, sphere, with, a, uniform, density, of, matter, later, willem, de, sitter, found, a, highly, symmetric, inflating, universe, which, described, a, universe, with, a, cosmological, constant, that, is, otherwise, empty, it, was, discovered, that, einstein, s, universe, is, unstable, and, that, small, fluctuations, cause, it, to, collapse, or, turn, into, a, de, sitter, universe, in, 1965, erast, gliner, proposed, a, unique, assumption, regarding, the, early, universe, s, pressure, in, the, context, of, the, einstein, friedmann, equations, according, to, his, idea, the, pressure, was, negatively, proportional, to, the, energy, density, this, relationship, between, pressure, and, energy, density, served, as, the, initial, theoretical, prediction, of, dark, energy, in, the, early, 1970s, zeldovich, noticed, the, flatness, and, horizon, problems, of, big, bang, cosmology, before, his, work, cosmology, was, presumed, to, be, symmetrical, on, purely, philosophical, grounds, in, the, soviet, union, this, and, other, considerations, led, belinski, and, khalatnikov, to, analyze, the, chaotic, bkl, singularity, in, general, relativity, misner, s, mixmaster, universe, attempted, to, use, this, chaotic, behavior, to, solve, the, cosmological, problems, with, limited, success, in, the, late, 1970s, sidney, coleman, applied, the, instanton, techniques, developed, by, alexander, polyakov, and, collaborators, to, study, the, fate, of, the, false, vacuum, in, quantum, field, theory, like, a, metastable, phase, in, statistical, mechanics, water, below, the, freezing, temperature, or, above, the, boiling, point, a, quantum, field, would, need, to, nucleate, a, large, enough, bubble, of, the, new, vacuum, the, new, phase, in, order, to, make, a, transition, coleman, found, the, most, likely, decay, pathway, for, vacuum, decay, and, calculated, the, inverse, lifetime, per, unit, volume, he, eventually, noted, that, gravitational, effects, would, be, significant, but, he, did, not, calculate, these, effects, and, did, not, apply, the, results, to, cosmology, the, universe, could, have, been, spontaneously, created, from, nothing, no, space, time, nor, matter, by, quantum, fluctuations, of, metastable, false, vacuum, causing, an, expanding, bubble, of, true, vacuum, in, the, soviet, union, alexei, starobinsky, noted, that, quantum, corrections, to, general, relativity, should, be, important, for, the, early, universe, these, generically, lead, to, curvature, squared, corrections, to, the, einstein, hilbert, action, and, a, form, of, f, r, modified, gravity, the, solution, to, einstein, s, equations, in, the, presence, of, curvature, squared, terms, when, the, curvatures, are, large, leads, to, an, effective, cosmological, constant, therefore, he, proposed, that, the, early, universe, went, through, an, inflationary, de, sitter, era, this, resolved, the, cosmology, problems, and, led, to, specific, predictions, for, the, corrections, to, the, microwave, background, radiation, corrections, that, were, then, calculated, in, detail, starobinsky, used, the, action, which, corresponds, to, the, potential, in, the, einstein, frame, this, results, in, the, observables, n, s, 1, 2, n, r, 12, n, 2, displaystyle, n, s, 1, frac, 2, n, quad, quad, r, frac, 12, n, 2, in, 1978, zeldovich, noted, the, magnetic, monopole, problem, which, was, an, unambiguous, quantitative, version, of, the, horizon, problem, this, time, in, a, subfield, of, particle, physics, which, led, to, several, speculative, attempts, to, resolve, it, in, 1980, alan, guth, realized, that, false, vacuum, decay, in, the, early, universe, would, solve, the, problem, leading, him, to, propose, a, scalar, driven, inflation, starobinsky, s, and, guth, s, scenarios, both, predicted, an, initial, de, sitter, phase, differing, only, in, mechanistic, details, guth, proposed, inflation, in, january, 1981, to, explain, the, nonexistence, of, magnetic, monopoles, it, was, guth, who, coined, the, term, inflation, at, the, same, time, starobinsky, argued, that, quantum, corrections, to, gravity, would, replace, the, supposed, initial, singularity, of, the, universe, with, an, exponentially, expanding, de, sitter, phase, in, october, 1980, demosthenes, kazanas, suggested, that, exponential, expansion, could, eliminate, the, particle, horizon, and, perhaps, solve, the, horizon, problem, while, katsuhiko, sato, suggested, that, an, exponential, expansion, could, eliminate, domain, walls, another, kind, of, exotic, relic, in, 1981, einhorn, and, sato, published, a, model, similar, to, guth, s, and, showed, that, it, would, resolve, the, puzzle, of, the, magnetic, monopole, abundance, in, grand, unified, theories, like, guth, they, concluded, that, such, a, model, not, only, required, fine, tuning, of, the, cosmological, constant, but, also, would, likely, lead, to, a, much, too, granular, universe, i, e, to, large, density, variations, resulting, from, bubble, wall, collisions, guth, proposed, that, as, the, early, universe, cooled, it, was, trapped, in, a, false, vacuum, with, a, high, energy, density, which, is, much, like, a, cosmological, constant, as, the, very, early, universe, cooled, it, was, trapped, in, a, metastable, state, it, was, supercooled, which, it, could, only, decay, out, of, through, the, process, of, bubble, nucleation, via, quantum, tunneling, bubbles, of, true, vacuum, spontaneously, form, in, the, sea, of, false, vacuum, and, rapidly, begin, expanding, at, the, speed, of, light, guth, recognized, that, this, model, was, problematic, because, the, model, did, not, reheat, properly, when, the, bubbles, nucleated, they, did, not, generate, radiation, radiation, could, only, be, generated, in, collisions, between, bubble, walls, but, if, inflation, lasted, long, enough, to, solve, the, initial, conditions, problems, collisions, between, bubbles, became, exceedingly, rare, in, any, one, causal, patch, it, is, likely, that, only, one, bubble, would, nucleate, kazanas, 1980, called, this, phase, of, the, early, universe, de, sitter, s, phase, the, name, inflation, was, given, by, guth, 1981, guth, himself, did, not, refer, to, work, of, kazanas, until, he, published, a, book, on, the, subject, under, the, title, the, inflationary, universe, the, quest, for, a, new, theory, of, cosmic, origin, 1997, where, he, apologizes, for, not, having, referenced, the, work, of, kazanas, and, of, others, related, to, inflation, the, bubble, collision, problem, was, solved, by, linde, and, independently, by, andreas, albrecht, and, paul, steinhardt, in, a, model, named, new, inflation, or, slow, roll, inflation, guth, s, model, then, became, known, as, old, inflation, in, this, model, instead, of, tunneling, out, of, a, false, vacuum, state, inflation, occurred, by, a, scalar, field, rolling, down, a, potential, energy, hill, when, the, field, rolls, very, slowly, compared, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, inflation, occurs, however, when, the, hill, becomes, steeper, inflation, ends, and, reheating, can, occur, eventually, it, was, shown, that, new, inflation, does, not, produce, a, perfectly, symmetric, universe, but, that, quantum, fluctuations, in, the, inflaton, are, created, these, fluctuations, form, the, primordial, seeds, for, all, structure, created, in, the, later, universe, these, fluctuations, were, first, calculated, by, viatcheslav, mukhanov, and, g, v, chibisov, in, analyzing, starobinsky, s, similar, model, in, the, context, of, inflation, they, were, worked, out, independently, of, the, work, of, mukhanov, and, chibisov, at, the, three, week, 1982, nuffield, workshop, on, the, very, early, universe, at, cambridge, university, the, fluctuations, were, calculated, by, four, groups, working, separately, over, the, course, of, the, workshop, stephen, hawking, starobinsky, guth, and, so, young, pi, and, bardeen, steinhardt, and, turner, inflation, is, a, mechanism, for, realizing, the, cosmological, principle, which, is, the, basis, of, the, standard, model, of, physical, cosmology, it, accounts, for, the, homogeneity, and, isotropy, of, the, observable, universe, in, addition, it, accounts, for, the, observed, flatness, and, absence, of, magnetic, monopoles, since, guth, s, early, work, each, of, these, observations, has, received, further, confirmation, most, impressively, by, the, detailed, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, made, by, the, planck, spacecraft, this, analysis, shows, that, the, universe, is, flat, to, within, 1, 2, percent, and, that, it, is, homogeneous, and, isotropic, to, one, part, in, 100, 000, inflation, predicts, that, the, structures, visible, in, the, universe, today, formed, through, the, gravitational, collapse, of, perturbations, that, were, formed, as, quantum, mechanical, fluctuations, in, the, inflationary, epoch, the, detailed, form, of, the, spectrum, of, perturbations, called, a, nearly, scale, invariant, gaussian, random, field, is, very, specific, and, has, only, two, free, parameters, one, is, the, amplitude, of, the, spectrum, and, the, spectral, index, which, measures, the, slight, deviation, from, scale, invariance, predicted, by, inflation, perfect, scale, invariance, corresponds, to, the, idealized, de, sitter, universe, the, other, free, parameter, is, the, tensor, to, scalar, ratio, the, simplest, inflation, models, those, without, fine, tuning, predict, a, tensor, to, scalar, ratio, near, 0, 1, inflation, predicts, that, the, observed, perturbations, should, be, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, each, other, these, are, called, adiabatic, or, isentropic, perturbations, this, structure, for, the, perturbations, has, been, confirmed, by, the, planck, spacecraft, wmap, spacecraft, and, other, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, experiments, and, galaxy, surveys, especially, the, ongoing, sloan, digital, sky, survey, these, experiments, have, shown, that, the, one, part, in, 100, 000, inhomogeneities, observed, have, exactly, the, form, predicted, by, theory, there, is, evidence, for, a, slight, deviation, from, scale, invariance, the, spectral, index, n, s, is, one, for, a, scale, invariant, harrison, zel, dovich, spectrum, the, simplest, inflation, models, predict, that, n, s, is, between, 0, 92, and, 0, 98, this, is, the, range, that, is, possible, without, fine, tuning, of, the, parameters, related, to, energy, from, planck, data, it, can, be, inferred, that, n, s, 0, 968, 0, 006, and, a, tensor, to, scalar, ratio, that, is, less, than, 0, 11, these, are, considered, an, important, confirmation, of, the, theory, of, inflation, various, inflation, theories, have, been, proposed, that, make, radically, different, predictions, but, they, generally, have, much, more, fine, tuning, than, should, be, necessary, as, a, physical, model, however, inflation, is, most, valuable, in, that, it, robustly, predicts, the, initial, conditions, of, the, universe, based, on, only, two, adjustable, parameters, the, spectral, index, that, can, only, change, in, a, small, range, and, the, amplitude, of, the, perturbations, except, in, contrived, models, this, is, true, regardless, of, how, inflation, is, realized, in, particle, physics, occasionally, effects, are, observed, that, appear, to, contradict, the, simplest, models, of, inflation, the, first, year, wmap, data, suggested, that, the, spectrum, might, not, be, nearly, scale, invariant, but, might, instead, have, a, slight, curvature, however, the, third, year, data, revealed, that, the, effect, was, a, statistical, anomaly, another, effect, remarked, upon, since, the, first, cosmic, microwave, background, satellite, the, cosmic, background, explorer, is, that, the, amplitude, of, the, quadrupole, moment, of, the, cmb, is, unexpectedly, low, and, the, other, low, multipoles, appear, to, be, preferentially, aligned, with, the, ecliptic, plane, some, have, claimed, that, this, is, a, signature, of, non, gaussianity, and, thus, contradicts, the, simplest, models, of, inflation, others, have, suggested, that, the, effect, may, be, due, to, other, new, physics, foreground, contamination, or, even, publication, bias, an, experimental, program, is, underway, to, further, test, inflation, with, more, precise, cmb, measurements, in, particular, high, precision, measurements, of, the, so, called, b, modes, of, the, polarization, of, the, background, radiation, could, provide, evidence, of, the, gravitational, radiation, produced, by, inflation, and, could, also, show, whether, the, energy, scale, of, inflation, predicted, by, the, simplest, models, 10, 15, 10, 16, gev, is, correct, in, march, 2014, the, bicep2, team, announced, b, mode, cmb, polarization, confirming, inflation, had, been, demonstrated, the, team, announced, the, tensor, to, scalar, power, ratio, r, was, between, 0, 15, and, 0, 27, rejecting, the, null, hypothesis, r, is, expected, to, be, 0, in, the, absence, of, inflation, however, on, 19, june, 2014, lowered, confidence, in, confirming, the, findings, was, reported, on, 19, september, 2014, a, further, reduction, in, confidence, was, reported, and, on, 30, january, 2015, even, less, confidence, yet, was, reported, by, 2018, additional, data, suggested, with, 95, confidence, that, r, displaystyle, r, is, 0, 06, or, lower, consistent, with, the, null, hypothesis, but, still, also, consistent, with, many, remaining, models, of, inflation, other, potentially, corroborating, measurements, are, expected, from, the, planck, spacecraft, although, it, is, unclear, if, the, signal, will, be, visible, or, if, contamination, from, foreground, sources, will, interfere, other, forthcoming, measurements, such, as, those, of, 21, centimeter, radiation, radiation, emitted, and, absorbed, from, neutral, hydrogen, before, the, first, stars, formed, may, measure, the, power, spectrum, with, even, greater, resolution, than, the, cmb, and, galaxy, surveys, although, it, is, not, known, if, these, measurements, will, be, possible, or, if, interference, with, radio, sources, on, earth, and, in, the, galaxy, will, be, too, great, in, guth, s, early, proposal, it, was, thought, that, the, inflaton, was, the, higgs, field, the, field, that, explains, the, mass, of, the, elementary, particles, it, is, now, believed, by, some, that, the, inflaton, cannot, be, the, higgs, field, although, the, recent, discovery, of, the, higgs, boson, has, increased, the, number, of, works, considering, the, higgs, field, as, inflaton, one, problem, of, this, identification, is, the, current, tension, with, experimental, data, at, the, electroweak, scale, which, is, currently, under, study, at, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, other, models, of, inflation, relied, on, the, properties, of, grand, unified, theories, at, present, while, inflation, is, understood, principally, by, its, detailed, predictions, of, the, initial, conditions, for, the, hot, early, universe, the, particle, physics, is, largely, ad, hoc, modelling, as, such, although, predictions, of, inflation, have, been, consistent, with, the, results, of, observational, tests, many, open, questions, remain, one, of, the, most, severe, challenges, for, inflation, arises, from, the, need, for, fine, tuning, in, new, inflation, the, slow, roll, conditions, must, be, satisfied, for, inflation, to, occur, the, slow, roll, conditions, say, that, the, inflaton, potential, must, be, flat, compared, to, the, large, vacuum, energy, and, that, the, inflaton, particles, must, have, a, small, mass, new, inflation, requires, the, universe, to, have, a, scalar, field, with, an, especially, flat, potential, and, special, initial, conditions, however, explanations, for, these, fine, tunings, have, been, proposed, for, example, classically, scale, invariant, field, theories, where, scale, invariance, is, broken, by, quantum, effects, provide, an, explanation, of, the, flatness, of, inflationary, potentials, as, long, as, the, theory, can, be, studied, through, perturbation, theory, linde, proposed, a, theory, known, as, chaotic, inflation, in, which, he, suggested, that, the, conditions, for, inflation, were, actually, satisfied, quite, generically, inflation, will, occur, in, virtually, any, universe, that, begins, in, a, chaotic, high, energy, state, that, has, a, scalar, field, with, unbounded, potential, energy, however, in, his, model, the, inflaton, field, necessarily, takes, values, larger, than, one, planck, unit, for, this, reason, these, are, often, called, large, field, models, and, the, competing, new, inflation, models, are, called, small, field, models, in, this, situation, the, predictions, of, effective, field, theory, are, thought, to, be, invalid, as, renormalization, should, cause, large, corrections, that, could, prevent, inflation, this, problem, has, not, yet, been, resolved, and, some, cosmologists, argue, that, the, small, field, models, in, which, inflation, can, occur, at, a, much, lower, energy, scale, are, better, models, while, inflation, depends, on, quantum, field, theory, and, the, semiclassical, approximation, to, quantum, gravity, in, an, important, way, it, has, not, been, completely, reconciled, with, these, theories, brandenberger, commented, on, fine, tuning, in, another, situation, the, amplitude, of, the, primordial, inhomogeneities, produced, in, inflation, is, directly, tied, to, the, energy, scale, of, inflation, this, scale, is, suggested, to, be, around, 10, 16, gev, or, 10, 3, times, the, planck, energy, the, natural, scale, is, na, vely, the, planck, scale, so, this, small, value, could, be, seen, as, another, form, of, fine, tuning, called, a, hierarchy, problem, the, energy, density, given, by, the, scalar, potential, is, down, by, 10, 12, compared, to, the, planck, density, this, is, not, usually, considered, to, be, a, critical, problem, however, because, the, scale, of, inflation, corresponds, naturally, to, the, scale, of, gauge, unification, in, many, models, the, inflationary, phase, of, the, universe, s, expansion, lasts, forever, in, at, least, some, regions, of, the, universe, this, occurs, because, inflating, regions, expand, very, rapidly, reproducing, themselves, unless, the, rate, of, decay, to, the, non, inflating, phase, is, sufficiently, fast, new, inflating, regions, are, produced, more, rapidly, than, non, inflating, regions, in, such, models, most, of, the, volume, of, the, universe, is, continuously, inflating, at, any, given, time, all, models, of, eternal, inflation, produce, an, infinite, hypothetical, multiverse, typically, a, fractal, the, multiverse, theory, has, created, significant, dissension, in, the, scientific, community, about, the, viability, of, the, inflationary, model, paul, steinhardt, one, of, the, original, architects, of, the, inflationary, model, introduced, the, first, example, of, eternal, inflation, in, 1983, he, showed, that, the, inflation, could, proceed, forever, by, producing, bubbles, of, non, inflating, space, filled, with, hot, matter, and, radiation, surrounded, by, empty, space, that, continues, to, inflate, the, bubbles, could, not, grow, fast, enough, to, keep, up, with, the, inflation, later, that, same, year, alexander, vilenkin, showed, that, eternal, inflation, is, generic, although, new, inflation, is, classically, rolling, down, the, potential, quantum, fluctuations, can, sometimes, lift, it, to, previous, levels, these, regions, in, which, the, inflaton, fluctuates, upwards, expand, much, faster, than, regions, in, which, the, inflaton, has, a, lower, potential, energy, and, tend, to, dominate, in, terms, of, physical, volume, it, has, been, shown, that, any, inflationary, theory, with, an, unbounded, potential, is, eternal, there, are, well, known, theorems, that, this, steady, state, cannot, continue, forever, into, the, past, inflationary, spacetime, which, is, similar, to, de, sitter, space, is, incomplete, without, a, contracting, region, however, unlike, de, sitter, space, fluctuations, in, a, contracting, inflationary, space, collapse, to, form, a, gravitational, singularity, a, point, where, densities, become, infinite, therefore, it, is, necessary, to, have, a, theory, for, the, universe, s, initial, conditions, in, eternal, inflation, regions, with, inflation, have, an, exponentially, growing, volume, while, regions, that, are, not, inflating, do, not, this, suggests, that, the, volume, of, the, inflating, part, of, the, universe, in, the, global, picture, is, always, unimaginably, larger, than, the, part, that, has, stopped, inflating, even, though, inflation, eventually, ends, as, seen, by, any, single, pre, inflationary, observer, scientists, disagree, about, how, to, assign, a, probability, distribution, to, this, hypothetical, anthropic, landscape, if, the, probability, of, different, regions, is, counted, by, volume, one, should, expect, that, inflation, will, never, end, or, applying, boundary, conditions, that, a, local, observer, exists, to, observe, it, that, inflation, will, end, as, late, as, possible, some, physicists, believe, this, paradox, can, be, resolved, by, weighting, observers, by, their, pre, inflationary, volume, others, believe, that, there, is, no, resolution, to, the, paradox, and, that, the, multiverse, is, a, critical, flaw, in, the, inflationary, paradigm, paul, steinhardt, who, first, introduced, the, eternal, inflationary, model, later, became, one, of, its, most, vocal, critics, for, this, reason, some, physicists, have, tried, to, avoid, the, initial, conditions, problem, by, proposing, models, for, an, eternally, inflating, universe, with, no, origin, these, models, propose, that, while, the, universe, on, the, largest, scales, expands, exponentially, it, was, is, and, always, will, be, spatially, infinite, and, has, existed, and, will, exist, forever, other, proposals, attempt, to, describe, the, ex, nihilo, creation, of, the, universe, based, on, quantum, cosmology, and, the, following, inflation, vilenkin, put, forth, one, such, scenario, hartle, and, hawking, offered, the, no, boundary, proposal, for, the, initial, creation, of, the, universe, in, which, inflation, comes, about, naturally, guth, described, the, inflationary, universe, as, the, ultimate, free, lunch, new, universes, similar, to, our, own, are, continually, produced, in, a, vast, inflating, background, gravitational, interactions, in, this, case, circumvent, but, do, not, violate, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, energy, conservation, and, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, entropy, and, the, arrow, of, time, problem, however, while, there, is, consensus, that, this, solves, the, initial, conditions, problem, some, have, disputed, this, as, it, is, much, more, likely, that, the, universe, came, about, by, a, quantum, fluctuation, don, page, was, an, outspoken, critic, of, inflation, because, of, this, anomaly, he, stressed, that, the, thermodynamic, arrow, of, time, necessitates, low, entropy, initial, conditions, which, would, be, highly, unlikely, according, to, them, rather, than, solving, this, problem, the, inflation, theory, aggravates, it, the, reheating, at, the, end, of, the, inflation, era, increases, entropy, making, it, necessary, for, the, initial, state, of, the, universe, to, be, even, more, orderly, than, in, other, big, bang, theories, with, no, inflation, phase, hawking, and, page, later, found, ambiguous, results, when, they, attempted, to, compute, the, probability, of, inflation, in, the, hartle, hawking, initial, state, other, authors, have, argued, that, since, inflation, is, eternal, the, probability, doesn, t, matter, as, long, as, it, is, not, precisely, zero, once, it, starts, inflation, perpetuates, itself, and, quickly, dominates, the, universe, 223, 225, however, albrecht, and, lorenzo, sorbo, argued, that, the, probability, of, an, inflationary, cosmos, consistent, with, today, s, observations, emerging, by, a, random, fluctuation, from, some, pre, existent, state, is, much, higher, than, that, of, a, non, inflationary, cosmos, this, is, because, the, seed, amount, of, non, gravitational, energy, required, for, the, inflationary, cosmos, is, so, much, less, than, that, for, a, non, inflationary, alternative, which, outweighs, any, entropic, considerations, another, problem, that, has, occasionally, been, mentioned, is, the, trans, planckian, problem, or, trans, planckian, effects, since, the, energy, scale, of, inflation, and, the, planck, scale, are, relatively, close, some, of, the, quantum, fluctuations, that, have, made, up, the, structure, in, our, universe, were, smaller, than, the, planck, length, before, inflation, therefore, there, ought, to, be, corrections, from, planck, scale, physics, in, particular, the, unknown, quantum, theory, of, gravity, some, disagreement, remains, about, the, magnitude, of, this, effect, about, whether, it, is, just, on, the, threshold, of, detectability, or, completely, undetectable, another, kind, of, inflation, called, hybrid, inflation, is, an, extension, of, new, inflation, it, introduces, additional, scalar, fields, so, that, while, one, of, the, scalar, fields, is, responsible, for, normal, slow, roll, inflation, another, triggers, the, end, of, inflation, when, inflation, has, continued, for, sufficiently, long, it, becomes, favorable, to, the, second, field, to, decay, into, a, much, lower, energy, state, in, hybrid, inflation, one, scalar, field, is, responsible, for, most, of, the, energy, density, thus, determining, the, rate, of, expansion, while, another, is, responsible, for, the, slow, roll, thus, determining, the, period, of, inflation, and, its, termination, thus, fluctuations, in, the, former, inflaton, would, not, affect, inflation, termination, while, fluctuations, in, the, latter, would, not, affect, the, rate, of, expansion, therefore, hybrid, inflation, is, not, eternal, when, the, second, slow, rolling, inflaton, reaches, the, bottom, of, its, potential, it, changes, the, location, of, the, minimum, of, the, first, inflaton, s, potential, which, leads, to, a, fast, roll, of, the, inflaton, down, its, potential, leading, to, termination, of, inflation, dark, energy, is, broadly, similar, to, inflation, and, is, thought, to, be, causing, the, expansion, of, the, present, day, universe, to, accelerate, however, the, energy, scale, of, dark, energy, is, much, lower, 10, 12, gev, roughly, 27, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, the, scale, of, inflation, the, discovery, of, flux, compactifications, opened, the, way, for, reconciling, inflation, and, string, theory, brane, inflation, suggests, that, inflation, arises, from, the, motion, of, d, branes, in, the, compactified, geometry, usually, towards, a, stack, of, anti, d, branes, this, theory, governed, by, the, dirac, born, infeld, action, is, different, from, ordinary, inflation, the, dynamics, are, not, completely, understood, it, appears, that, special, conditions, are, necessary, since, inflation, occurs, in, tunneling, between, two, vacua, in, the, string, landscape, the, process, of, tunneling, between, two, vacua, is, a, form, of, old, inflation, but, new, inflation, must, then, occur, by, some, other, mechanism, when, investigating, the, effects, the, theory, of, loop, quantum, gravity, would, have, on, cosmology, a, loop, quantum, cosmology, model, has, evolved, that, provides, a, possible, mechanism, for, cosmological, inflation, loop, quantum, gravity, assumes, a, quantized, spacetime, if, the, energy, density, is, larger, than, can, be, held, by, the, quantized, spacetime, it, is, thought, to, bounce, back, other, models, have, been, advanced, that, are, claimed, to, explain, some, or, all, of, the, observations, addressed, by, inflation, the, big, bounce, hypothesis, attempts, to, replace, the, cosmic, singularity, with, a, cosmic, contraction, and, bounce, thereby, explaining, the, initial, conditions, that, led, to, the, big, bang, the, flatness, and, horizon, problems, are, naturally, solved, in, the, einstein, cartan, sciama, kibble, theory, of, gravity, without, needing, an, exotic, form, of, matter, or, free, parameters, this, theory, extends, general, relativity, by, removing, a, constraint, of, the, symmetry, of, the, affine, connection, and, regarding, its, antisymmetric, part, the, torsion, tensor, as, a, dynamical, variable, the, minimal, coupling, between, torsion, and, dirac, spinors, generates, a, spin, spin, interaction, that, is, significant, in, fermionic, matter, at, extremely, high, densities, such, an, interaction, averts, the, unphysical, big, bang, singularity, replacing, it, with, a, cusp, like, bounce, at, a, finite, minimum, scale, factor, before, which, the, universe, was, contracting, the, rapid, expansion, immediately, after, the, big, bounce, explains, why, the, present, universe, at, largest, scales, appears, spatially, flat, homogeneous, and, isotropic, as, the, density, of, the, universe, decreases, the, effects, of, torsion, weaken, and, the, universe, smoothly, enters, the, radiation, dominated, era, the, ekpyrotic, and, cyclic, models, are, also, considered, adjuncts, to, inflation, these, models, solve, the, horizon, problem, through, an, expanding, epoch, well, before, the, big, bang, and, then, generate, the, required, spectrum, of, primordial, density, perturbations, during, a, contracting, phase, leading, to, a, big, crunch, the, universe, passes, through, the, big, crunch, and, emerges, in, a, hot, big, bang, phase, in, this, sense, they, are, reminiscent, of, richard, chace, tolman, s, oscillatory, universe, in, tolman, s, model, however, the, total, age, of, the, universe, is, necessarily, finite, while, in, these, models, this, is, not, necessarily, so, whether, the, correct, spectrum, of, density, fluctuations, can, be, produced, and, whether, the, universe, can, successfully, navigate, the, big, bang, big, crunch, transition, remains, a, topic, of, controversy, and, current, research, ekpyrotic, models, avoid, the, magnetic, monopole, problem, as, long, as, the, temperature, at, the, big, crunch, big, bang, transition, remains, below, the, grand, unified, scale, as, this, is, the, temperature, required, to, produce, magnetic, monopoles, in, the, first, place, as, things, stand, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, slowing, down, of, the, expansion, but, this, is, not, surprising, as, each, cycle, is, expected, to, last, on, the, order, of, a, trillion, years, string, theory, requires, that, in, addition, to, the, three, observable, spatial, dimensions, additional, dimensions, exist, that, are, curled, up, or, compactified, see, also, kaluza, klein, theory, extra, dimensions, appear, as, a, frequent, component, of, supergravity, models, and, other, approaches, to, quantum, gravity, this, raised, the, contingent, question, of, why, four, space, time, dimensions, became, large, and, the, rest, became, unobservably, small, an, attempt, to, address, this, question, called, string, gas, cosmology, was, proposed, by, robert, brandenberger, and, cumrun, vafa, this, model, focuses, on, the, dynamics, of, the, early, universe, considered, as, a, hot, gas, of, strings, brandenberger, and, vafa, show, that, a, dimension, of, spacetime, can, only, expand, if, the, strings, that, wind, around, it, can, efficiently, annihilate, each, other, each, string, is, a, one, dimensional, object, and, the, largest, number, of, dimensions, in, which, two, strings, will, generically, intersect, and, presumably, annihilate, is, three, therefore, the, most, likely, number, of, non, compact, large, spatial, dimensions, is, three, current, work, on, this, model, centers, on, whether, it, can, succeed, in, stabilizing, the, size, of, the, compactified, dimensions, and, produce, the, correct, spectrum, of, primordial, density, perturbations, the, original, model, did, not, solve, the, entropy, and, flatness, problems, of, standard, cosmology, although, brandenburger, and, coauthors, later, argued, that, these, problems, can, be, eliminated, by, implementing, string, gas, cosmology, in, the, context, of, a, bouncing, universe, scenario, cosmological, models, employing, a, variable, speed, of, light, have, been, proposed, to, resolve, the, horizon, problem, of, and, provide, an, alternative, to, cosmic, inflation, in, the, vsl, models, the, fundamental, constant, c, denoting, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, greater, in, the, early, universe, than, its, present, value, effectively, increasing, the, particle, horizon, at, the, time, of, decoupling, sufficiently, to, account, for, the, observed, isotropy, of, the, cmb, since, its, introduction, by, alan, guth, in, 1980, the, inflationary, paradigm, has, become, widely, accepted, nevertheless, many, physicists, mathematicians, and, philosophers, of, science, have, voiced, criticisms, claiming, untestable, predictions, and, a, lack, of, serious, empirical, support, in, 1999, john, earman, and, jes, s, moster, n, published, a, thorough, critical, review, of, inflationary, cosmology, concluding, as, pointed, out, by, roger, penrose, from, 1986, on, in, order, to, work, inflation, requires, extremely, specific, initial, conditions, of, its, own, so, that, the, problem, or, pseudo, problem, of, initial, conditions, is, not, solved, the, problem, of, specific, or, fine, tuned, initial, conditions, would, not, have, been, solved, it, would, have, gotten, worse, at, a, conference, in, 2015, penrose, said, that, a, recurrent, criticism, of, inflation, is, that, the, invoked, inflaton, field, does, not, correspond, to, any, known, physical, field, and, that, its, potential, energy, curve, seems, to, be, an, ad, hoc, contrivance, to, accommodate, almost, any, data, obtainable, paul, steinhardt, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, inflationary, cosmology, has, recently, become, one, of, its, sharpest, critics, he, calls, bad, inflation, a, period, of, accelerated, expansion, whose, outcome, conflicts, with, observations, and, good, inflation, one, compatible, with, them, together, with, anna, ijjas, and, abraham, loeb, he, wrote, articles, claiming, that, the, inflationary, paradigm, is, in, trouble, in, view, of, the, data, from, the, planck, satellite, counter, arguments, were, presented, by, alan, guth, david, kaiser, and, yasunori, nomura, and, by, saying, that
