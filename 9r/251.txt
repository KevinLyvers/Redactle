a, star, system, or, stellar, system, is, a, small, number, of, stars, that, orbit, each, other, bound, by, gravitational, attraction, a, large, group, of, stars, bound, by, gravitation, is, generally, called, a, star, cluster, or, galaxy, although, broadly, speaking, they, are, also, star, systems, star, systems, are, not, to, be, confused, with, planetary, systems, which, include, planets, and, similar, bodies, such, as, comets, a, star, system, of, two, stars, is, known, as, a, binary, star, binary, star, system, or, physical, double, star, if, there, are, no, tidal, effects, no, perturbation, from, other, forces, and, no, transfer, of, mass, from, one, star, to, the, other, such, a, system, is, stable, and, both, stars, will, trace, out, an, elliptical, orbit, around, the, barycenter, of, the, system, indefinitely, see, two, body, problem, examples, of, binary, systems, are, sirius, procyon, and, cygnus, x, 1, the, last, of, which, probably, consists, of, a, star, and, a, black, hole, a, multiple, star, system, consists, of, two, or, more, stars, that, appear, from, earth, to, be, close, to, one, another, in, the, sky, this, may, result, from, the, stars, actually, being, physically, close, and, gravitationally, bound, to, each, other, in, which, case, it, is, a, physical, multiple, star, or, this, closeness, may, be, merely, apparent, in, which, case, it, is, an, optical, multiple, star, physical, multiple, stars, are, also, commonly, called, multiple, stars, or, multiple, star, systems, most, multiple, star, systems, are, triple, stars, systems, with, four, or, more, components, are, less, likely, to, occur, multiple, star, systems, are, called, triple, ternary, or, trinary, if, they, contain, 3, stars, quadruple, or, quaternary, if, they, contain, 4, stars, quintuple, or, quintenary, with, 5, stars, sextuple, or, sextenary, with, 6, stars, septuple, or, septenary, with, 7, stars, octuple, or, octenary, with, 8, stars, these, systems, are, smaller, than, open, star, clusters, which, have, more, complex, dynamics, and, typically, have, from, 100, to, 1, 000, stars, most, multiple, star, systems, known, are, triple, for, higher, multiplicities, the, number, of, known, systems, with, a, given, multiplicity, decreases, exponentially, with, multiplicity, for, example, in, the, 1999, revision, of, tokovinin, s, catalog, of, physical, multiple, stars, 551, out, of, the, 728, systems, described, are, triple, however, because, of, suspected, selection, effects, the, ability, to, interpret, these, statistics, is, very, limited, multiple, star, systems, can, be, divided, into, two, main, dynamical, classes, or, most, multiple, star, systems, are, organized, in, what, is, called, a, hierarchical, system, the, stars, in, the, system, can, be, divided, into, two, smaller, groups, each, of, which, traverses, a, larger, orbit, around, the, system, s, center, of, mass, each, of, these, smaller, groups, must, also, be, hierarchical, which, means, that, they, must, be, divided, into, smaller, subgroups, which, themselves, are, hierarchical, and, so, on, each, level, of, the, hierarchy, can, be, treated, as, a, two, body, problem, by, considering, close, pairs, as, if, they, were, a, single, star, in, these, systems, there, is, little, interaction, between, the, orbits, and, the, stars, motion, will, continue, to, approximate, stable, keplerian, orbits, around, the, system, s, center, of, mass, unlike, the, unstable, trapezia, systems, or, the, even, more, complex, dynamics, of, the, large, number, of, stars, in, star, clusters, and, galaxies, in, a, physical, triple, star, system, each, star, orbits, the, center, of, mass, of, the, system, usually, two, of, the, stars, form, a, close, binary, system, and, the, third, orbits, this, pair, at, a, distance, much, larger, than, that, of, the, binary, orbit, this, arrangement, is, called, hierarchical, the, reason, for, this, arrangement, is, that, if, the, inner, and, outer, orbits, are, comparable, in, size, the, system, may, become, dynamically, unstable, leading, to, a, star, being, ejected, from, the, system, ez, aquarii, is, an, example, of, a, physical, hierarchical, triple, system, which, has, an, outer, star, orbiting, an, inner, physical, binary, composed, of, two, more, red, dwarf, stars, triple, stars, that, are, not, all, gravitationally, bound, might, comprise, a, physical, binary, and, an, optical, companion, such, as, beta, cephei, or, in, rare, cases, a, purely, optical, triple, star, such, as, gamma, serpentis, hierarchical, multiple, star, systems, with, more, than, three, stars, can, produce, a, number, of, more, complicated, arrangements, these, arrangements, can, be, organized, by, what, evans, 1968, called, mobile, diagrams, which, look, similar, to, ornamental, mobiles, hung, from, the, ceiling, examples, of, hierarchical, systems, are, given, in, the, figure, to, the, right, mobile, diagrams, each, level, of, the, diagram, illustrates, the, decomposition, of, the, system, into, two, or, more, systems, with, smaller, size, evans, calls, a, diagram, multiplex, if, there, is, a, node, with, more, than, two, children, i, e, if, the, decomposition, of, some, subsystem, involves, two, or, more, orbits, with, comparable, size, because, as, we, have, already, seen, for, triple, stars, this, may, be, unstable, multiple, stars, are, expected, to, be, simplex, meaning, that, at, each, level, there, are, exactly, two, children, evans, calls, the, number, of, levels, in, the, diagram, its, hierarchy, higher, hierarchies, are, also, possible, most, of, these, higher, hierarchies, either, are, stable, or, suffer, from, internal, perturbations, others, consider, complex, multiple, stars, will, in, time, theoretically, disintegrate, into, less, complex, multiple, stars, like, more, common, observed, triples, or, quadruples, are, possible, trapezia, are, usually, very, young, unstable, systems, these, are, thought, to, form, in, stellar, nurseries, and, quickly, fragment, into, stable, multiple, stars, which, in, the, process, may, eject, components, as, galactic, high, velocity, stars, they, are, named, after, the, multiple, star, system, known, as, the, trapezium, cluster, in, the, heart, of, the, orion, nebula, such, systems, are, not, rare, and, commonly, appear, close, to, or, within, bright, nebulae, these, stars, have, no, standard, hierarchical, arrangements, but, compete, for, stable, orbits, this, relationship, is, called, interplay, such, stars, eventually, settle, down, to, a, close, binary, with, a, distant, companion, with, the, other, star, s, previously, in, the, system, ejected, into, interstellar, space, at, high, velocities, this, dynamic, may, explain, the, runaway, stars, that, might, have, been, ejected, during, a, collision, of, two, binary, star, groups, or, a, multiple, system, this, event, is, credited, with, ejecting, ae, aurigae, mu, columbae, and, 53, arietis, at, above, 200, km, s, 1, and, has, been, traced, to, the, trapezium, cluster, in, the, orion, nebula, some, two, million, years, ago, the, components, of, multiple, stars, can, be, specified, by, appending, the, suffixes, a, b, c, etc, to, the, system, s, designation, suffixes, such, as, ab, may, be, used, to, denote, the, pair, consisting, of, a, and, b, the, sequence, of, letters, b, c, etc, may, be, assigned, in, order, of, separation, from, the, component, a, components, discovered, close, to, an, already, known, component, may, be, assigned, suffixes, such, as, aa, ba, and, so, forth, a, a, tokovinin, s, multiple, star, catalogue, uses, a, system, in, which, each, subsystem, in, a, mobile, diagram, is, encoded, by, a, sequence, of, digits, in, the, mobile, diagram, d, above, for, example, the, widest, system, would, be, given, the, number, 1, while, the, subsystem, containing, its, primary, component, would, be, numbered, 11, and, the, subsystem, containing, its, secondary, component, would, be, numbered, 12, subsystems, which, would, appear, below, this, in, the, mobile, diagram, will, be, given, numbers, with, three, four, or, more, digits, when, describing, a, non, hierarchical, system, by, this, method, the, same, subsystem, number, will, be, used, more, than, once, for, example, a, system, with, three, visual, components, a, b, and, c, no, two, of, which, can, be, grouped, into, a, subsystem, would, have, two, subsystems, numbered, 1, denoting, the, two, binaries, ab, and, ac, in, this, case, if, b, and, c, were, subsequently, resolved, into, binaries, they, would, be, given, the, subsystem, numbers, 12, and, 13, the, current, nomenclature, for, double, and, multiple, stars, can, cause, confusion, as, binary, stars, discovered, in, different, ways, are, given, different, designations, for, example, discoverer, designations, for, visual, binary, stars, and, variable, star, designations, for, eclipsing, binary, stars, and, worse, component, letters, may, be, assigned, differently, by, different, authors, so, that, for, example, one, person, s, a, can, be, another, s, c, discussion, starting, in, 1999, resulted, in, four, proposed, schemes, to, address, this, problem, for, a, designation, system, identifying, the, hierarchy, within, the, system, has, the, advantage, that, it, makes, identifying, subsystems, and, computing, their, properties, easier, however, it, causes, problems, when, new, components, are, discovered, at, a, level, above, or, intermediate, to, the, existing, hierarchy, in, this, case, part, of, the, hierarchy, will, shift, inwards, components, which, are, found, to, be, nonexistent, or, are, later, reassigned, to, a, different, subsystem, also, cause, problems, during, the, 24th, general, assembly, of, the, international, astronomical, union, in, 2000, the, wmc, scheme, was, endorsed, and, it, was, resolved, by, commissions, 5, 8, 26, 42, and, 45, that, it, should, be, expanded, into, a, usable, uniform, designation, scheme, a, sample, of, a, catalog, using, the, wmc, scheme, covering, half, an, hour, of, right, ascension, was, later, prepared, the, issue, was, discussed, again, at, the, 25th, general, assembly, in, 2003, and, it, was, again, resolved, by, commissions, 5, 8, 26, 42, and, 45, as, well, as, the, working, group, on, interferometry, that, the, wmc, scheme, should, be, expanded, and, further, developed, the, sample, wmc, is, hierarchically, organized, the, hierarchy, used, is, based, on, observed, orbital, periods, or, separations, since, it, contains, many, visual, double, stars, which, may, be, optical, rather, than, physical, this, hierarchy, may, be, only, apparent, it, uses, upper, case, letters, a, b, for, the, first, level, of, the, hierarchy, lower, case, letters, a, b, for, the, second, level, and, numbers, 1, 2, for, the, third, subsequent, levels, would, use, alternating, lower, case, letters, and, numbers, but, no, examples, of, this, were, found, in, the, sample
