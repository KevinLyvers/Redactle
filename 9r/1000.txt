flight, or, flying, is, the, process, by, which, an, object, moves, through, a, space, without, contacting, any, planetary, surface, either, within, an, atmosphere, i, e, air, flight, or, aviation, or, through, the, vacuum, of, outer, space, i, e, spaceflight, this, can, be, achieved, by, generating, aerodynamic, lift, associated, with, gliding, or, propulsive, thrust, aerostatically, using, buoyancy, or, by, ballistic, movement, many, things, can, fly, from, animal, aviators, such, as, birds, bats, and, insects, to, natural, gliders, parachuters, such, as, patagial, animals, anemochorous, seeds, and, ballistospores, to, human, inventions, like, aircraft, airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc, and, rockets, which, may, propel, spacecraft, and, spaceplanes, the, engineering, aspects, of, flight, are, the, purview, of, aerospace, engineering, which, is, subdivided, into, aeronautics, the, study, of, vehicles, that, travel, through, the, atmosphere, and, astronautics, the, study, of, vehicles, that, travel, through, space, and, ballistics, the, study, of, the, flight, of, projectiles, humans, have, managed, to, construct, lighter, than, air, vehicles, that, raise, off, the, ground, and, fly, due, to, their, buoyancy, in, the, air, an, aerostat, is, a, system, that, remains, aloft, primarily, through, the, use, of, buoyancy, to, give, an, aircraft, the, same, overall, density, as, air, aerostats, include, free, balloons, airships, and, moored, balloons, an, aerostat, s, main, structural, component, is, its, envelope, a, lightweight, skin, that, encloses, a, volume, of, lifting, gas, to, provide, buoyancy, to, which, other, components, are, attached, aerostats, are, so, named, because, they, use, aerostatic, lift, a, buoyant, force, that, does, not, require, lateral, movement, through, the, surrounding, air, mass, to, effect, a, lifting, force, by, contrast, aerodynes, primarily, use, aerodynamic, lift, which, requires, the, lateral, movement, of, at, least, some, part, of, the, aircraft, through, the, surrounding, air, mass, some, things, that, fly, do, not, generate, propulsive, thrust, through, the, air, for, example, the, flying, squirrel, this, is, termed, gliding, some, other, things, can, exploit, rising, air, to, climb, such, as, raptors, when, gliding, and, man, made, sailplane, gliders, this, is, termed, soaring, however, most, other, birds, and, all, powered, aircraft, need, a, source, of, propulsion, to, climb, this, is, termed, powered, flight, the, only, groups, of, living, things, that, use, powered, flight, are, birds, insects, and, bats, while, many, groups, have, evolved, gliding, the, extinct, pterosaurs, an, order, of, reptiles, contemporaneous, with, the, dinosaurs, were, also, very, successful, flying, animals, and, there, were, apparently, some, flying, dinosaurs, see, flying, and, gliding, animals, non, avian, dinosaurs, each, of, these, groups, wings, evolved, independently, with, insects, the, first, animal, group, to, evolve, flight, the, wings, of, the, flying, vertebrate, groups, are, all, based, on, the, forelimbs, but, differ, significantly, in, structure, insect, wings, are, hypothesized, to, be, highly, modified, versions, of, structures, that, form, gills, in, most, other, groups, of, arthropods, bats, are, the, only, mammals, capable, of, sustaining, level, flight, see, bat, flight, however, there, are, several, gliding, mammals, which, are, able, to, glide, from, tree, to, tree, using, fleshy, membranes, between, their, limbs, some, can, travel, hundreds, of, meters, in, this, way, with, very, little, loss, in, height, flying, frogs, use, greatly, enlarged, webbed, feet, for, a, similar, purpose, and, there, are, flying, lizards, which, fold, out, their, mobile, ribs, into, a, pair, of, flat, gliding, surfaces, flying, snakes, also, use, mobile, ribs, to, flatten, their, body, into, an, aerodynamic, shape, with, a, back, and, forth, motion, much, the, same, as, they, use, on, the, ground, flying, fish, can, glide, using, enlarged, wing, like, fins, and, have, been, observed, soaring, for, hundreds, of, meters, it, is, thought, that, this, ability, was, chosen, by, natural, selection, because, it, was, an, effective, means, of, escape, from, underwater, predators, the, longest, recorded, flight, of, a, flying, fish, was, 45, seconds, most, birds, fly, see, bird, flight, with, some, exceptions, the, largest, birds, the, ostrich, and, the, emu, are, earthbound, flightless, birds, as, were, the, now, extinct, dodos, and, the, phorusrhacids, which, were, the, dominant, predators, of, south, america, in, the, cenozoic, era, the, non, flying, penguins, have, wings, adapted, for, use, under, water, and, use, the, same, wing, movements, for, swimming, that, most, other, birds, use, for, flight, most, small, flightless, birds, are, native, to, small, islands, and, lead, a, lifestyle, where, flight, would, offer, little, advantage, among, living, animals, that, fly, the, wandering, albatross, has, the, greatest, wingspan, up, to, 3, 5, meters, 11, feet, the, great, bustard, has, the, greatest, weight, topping, at, 21, kilograms, 46, pounds, most, species, of, insects, can, fly, as, adults, insect, flight, makes, use, of, either, of, two, basic, aerodynamic, models, creating, a, leading, edge, vortex, found, in, most, insects, and, using, clap, and, fling, found, in, very, small, insects, such, as, thrips, many, species, of, spiders, spider, mites, and, lepidoptera, use, a, technique, called, ballooning, to, ride, air, currents, such, as, thermals, by, exposing, their, gossamer, threads, which, gets, lifted, by, wind, and, atmospheric, electric, fields, mechanical, flight, is, the, use, of, a, machine, to, fly, these, machines, include, aircraft, such, as, airplanes, gliders, helicopters, autogyros, airships, balloons, ornithopters, as, well, as, spacecraft, gliders, are, capable, of, unpowered, flight, another, form, of, mechanical, flight, is, para, sailing, where, a, parachute, like, object, is, pulled, by, a, boat, in, an, airplane, lift, is, created, by, the, wings, the, shape, of, the, wings, of, the, airplane, are, designed, specially, for, the, type, of, flight, desired, there, are, different, types, of, wings, tempered, semi, tempered, sweptback, rectangular, and, elliptical, an, aircraft, wing, is, sometimes, called, an, airfoil, which, is, a, device, that, creates, lift, when, air, flows, across, it, supersonic, flight, is, flight, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, supersonic, flight, is, associated, with, the, formation, of, shock, waves, that, form, a, sonic, boom, that, can, be, heard, from, the, ground, and, is, frequently, startling, the, creation, of, this, shockwave, requires, a, significant, amount, of, energy, because, of, this, supersonic, flight, is, generally, less, efficient, than, subsonic, flight, at, about, 85, of, the, speed, of, sound, hypersonic, flight, is, very, high, speed, flight, where, the, heat, generated, by, the, compression, of, the, air, due, to, the, motion, through, the, air, causes, chemical, changes, to, the, air, hypersonic, flight, is, achieved, primarily, by, reentering, spacecraft, such, as, the, space, shuttle, and, soyuz, some, things, generate, little, or, no, lift, and, move, only, or, mostly, under, the, action, of, momentum, gravity, air, drag, and, in, some, cases, thrust, this, is, termed, ballistic, flight, examples, include, balls, arrows, bullets, fireworks, etc, essentially, an, extreme, form, of, ballistic, flight, spaceflight, is, the, use, of, space, technology, to, achieve, the, flight, of, spacecraft, into, and, through, outer, space, examples, include, ballistic, missiles, orbital, spaceflight, etc, spaceflight, is, used, in, space, exploration, and, also, in, commercial, activities, like, space, tourism, and, satellite, telecommunications, additional, non, commercial, uses, of, spaceflight, include, space, observatories, reconnaissance, satellites, and, other, earth, observation, satellites, a, spaceflight, typically, begins, with, a, rocket, launch, which, provides, the, initial, thrust, to, overcome, the, force, of, gravity, and, propels, the, spacecraft, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, once, in, space, the, motion, of, a, spacecraft, both, when, unpropelled, and, when, under, propulsion, is, covered, by, the, area, of, study, called, astrodynamics, some, spacecraft, remain, in, space, indefinitely, some, disintegrate, during, atmospheric, reentry, and, others, reach, a, planetary, or, lunar, surface, for, landing, or, impact, in, 2018, researchers, at, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, managed, to, fly, an, aeroplane, with, no, moving, parts, powered, by, an, ionic, wind, also, known, as, electroaerodynamic, thrust, many, human, cultures, have, built, devices, that, fly, from, the, earliest, projectiles, such, as, stones, and, spears, the, boomerang, in, australia, the, hot, air, kongming, lantern, and, kites, george, cayley, studied, flight, scientifically, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, otto, lilienthal, made, over, 200, gliding, flights, and, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, understand, flight, scientifically, his, work, was, replicated, and, extended, by, the, wright, brothers, who, made, gliding, flights, and, finally, the, first, controlled, and, extended, manned, powered, flights, spaceflight, particularly, human, spaceflight, became, a, reality, in, the, 20th, century, following, theoretical, and, practical, breakthroughs, by, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, and, robert, h, goddard, the, first, orbital, spaceflight, was, in, 1957, and, yuri, gagarin, was, carried, aboard, the, first, crewed, orbital, spaceflight, in, 1961, there, are, different, approaches, to, flight, if, an, object, has, a, lower, density, than, air, then, it, is, buoyant, and, is, able, to, float, in, the, air, without, expending, energy, a, heavier, than, air, craft, known, as, an, aerodyne, includes, flighted, animals, and, insects, fixed, wing, aircraft, and, rotorcraft, because, the, craft, is, heavier, than, air, it, must, generate, lift, to, overcome, its, weight, the, wind, resistance, caused, by, the, craft, moving, through, the, air, is, called, drag, and, is, overcome, by, propulsive, thrust, except, in, the, case, of, gliding, some, vehicles, also, use, thrust, in, the, place, of, lift, for, example, rockets, and, harrier, jump, jets, forces, relevant, to, flight, are, these, forces, must, be, balanced, for, stable, flight, to, occur, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, generates, forward, thrust, when, air, is, pushed, in, the, direction, opposite, to, flight, this, can, be, done, in, several, ways, including, by, the, spinning, blades, of, a, propeller, or, a, rotating, fan, pushing, air, out, from, the, back, of, a, jet, engine, or, by, ejecting, hot, gases, from, a, rocket, engine, the, forward, thrust, is, proportional, to, the, mass, of, the, airstream, multiplied, by, the, difference, in, velocity, of, the, airstream, reverse, thrust, can, be, generated, to, aid, braking, after, landing, by, reversing, the, pitch, of, variable, pitch, propeller, blades, or, using, a, thrust, reverser, on, a, jet, engine, rotary, wing, aircraft, and, thrust, vectoring, v, stol, aircraft, use, engine, thrust, to, support, the, weight, of, the, aircraft, and, vector, sum, of, this, thrust, fore, and, aft, to, control, forward, speed, in, the, context, of, an, air, flow, relative, to, a, flying, body, the, lift, force, is, the, component, of, the, aerodynamic, force, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, flow, direction, aerodynamic, lift, results, when, the, wing, causes, the, surrounding, air, to, be, deflected, the, air, then, causes, a, force, on, the, wing, in, the, opposite, direction, in, accordance, with, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, lift, is, commonly, associated, with, the, wing, of, an, aircraft, although, lift, is, also, generated, by, rotors, on, rotorcraft, which, are, effectively, rotating, wings, performing, the, same, function, without, requiring, that, the, aircraft, move, forward, through, the, air, while, common, meanings, of, the, word, lift, suggest, that, lift, opposes, gravity, aerodynamic, lift, can, be, in, any, direction, when, an, aircraft, is, cruising, for, example, lift, does, oppose, gravity, but, lift, occurs, at, an, angle, when, climbing, descending, or, banking, on, high, speed, cars, the, lift, force, is, directed, downwards, called, down, force, to, keep, the, car, stable, on, the, road, for, a, solid, object, moving, through, a, fluid, the, drag, is, the, component, of, the, net, aerodynamic, or, hydrodynamic, force, acting, opposite, to, the, direction, of, the, movement, therefore, drag, opposes, the, motion, of, the, object, and, in, a, powered, vehicle, it, must, be, overcome, by, thrust, the, process, which, creates, lift, also, causes, some, drag, aerodynamic, lift, is, created, by, the, motion, of, an, aerodynamic, object, wing, through, the, air, which, due, to, its, shape, and, angle, deflects, the, air, for, sustained, straight, and, level, flight, lift, must, be, equal, and, opposite, to, weight, in, general, long, narrow, wings, are, able, deflect, a, large, amount, of, air, at, a, slow, speed, whereas, smaller, wings, need, a, higher, forward, speed, to, deflect, an, equivalent, amount, of, air, and, thus, generate, an, equivalent, amount, of, lift, large, cargo, aircraft, tend, to, use, longer, wings, with, higher, angles, of, attack, whereas, supersonic, aircraft, tend, to, have, short, wings, and, rely, heavily, on, high, forward, speed, to, generate, lift, however, this, lift, deflection, process, inevitably, causes, a, retarding, force, called, drag, because, lift, and, drag, are, both, aerodynamic, forces, the, ratio, of, lift, to, drag, is, an, indication, of, the, aerodynamic, efficiency, of, the, airplane, the, lift, to, drag, ratio, is, the, l, d, ratio, pronounced, l, over, d, ratio, an, airplane, has, a, high, l, d, ratio, if, it, produces, a, large, amount, of, lift, or, a, small, amount, of, drag, the, lift, drag, ratio, is, determined, by, dividing, the, lift, coefficient, by, the, drag, coefficient, cl, cd, the, lift, coefficient, cl, is, equal, to, the, lift, l, divided, by, the, density, r, times, half, the, velocity, v, squared, times, the, wing, area, a, the, lift, coefficient, is, also, affected, by, the, compressibility, of, the, air, which, is, much, greater, at, higher, speeds, so, velocity, v, is, not, a, linear, function, compressibility, is, also, affected, by, the, shape, of, the, aircraft, surfaces, the, drag, coefficient, cd, is, equal, to, the, drag, d, divided, by, the, density, r, times, half, the, velocity, v, squared, times, the, reference, area, a, lift, to, drag, ratios, for, practical, aircraft, vary, from, about, 4, 1, for, vehicles, and, birds, with, relatively, short, wings, up, to, 60, 1, or, more, for, vehicles, with, very, long, wings, such, as, gliders, a, greater, angle, of, attack, relative, to, the, forward, movement, also, increases, the, extent, of, deflection, and, thus, generates, extra, lift, however, a, greater, angle, of, attack, also, generates, extra, drag, lift, drag, ratio, also, determines, the, glide, ratio, and, gliding, range, since, the, glide, ratio, is, based, only, on, the, relationship, of, the, aerodynamics, forces, acting, on, the, aircraft, aircraft, weight, will, not, affect, it, the, only, effect, weight, has, is, to, vary, the, time, that, the, aircraft, will, glide, for, a, heavier, aircraft, gliding, at, a, higher, airspeed, will, arrive, at, the, same, touchdown, point, in, a, shorter, time, air, pressure, acting, up, against, an, object, in, air, is, greater, than, the, pressure, above, pushing, down, the, buoyancy, in, both, cases, is, equal, to, the, weight, of, fluid, displaced, archimedes, principle, holds, for, air, just, as, it, does, for, water, a, cubic, meter, of, air, at, ordinary, atmospheric, pressure, and, room, temperature, has, a, mass, of, about, 1, 2, kilograms, so, its, weight, is, about, 12, newtons, therefore, any, 1, cubic, meter, object, in, air, is, buoyed, up, with, a, force, of, 12, newtons, if, the, mass, of, the, 1, cubic, meter, object, is, greater, than, 1, 2, kilograms, so, that, its, weight, is, greater, than, 12, newtons, it, falls, to, the, ground, when, released, if, an, object, of, this, size, has, a, mass, less, than, 1, 2, kilograms, it, rises, in, the, air, any, object, that, has, a, mass, that, is, less, than, the, mass, of, an, equal, volume, of, air, will, rise, in, air, in, other, words, any, object, less, dense, than, air, will, rise, thrust, to, weight, ratio, is, as, its, name, suggests, the, ratio, of, instantaneous, thrust, to, weight, where, weight, means, weight, at, the, earth, s, standard, acceleration, g, 0, displaystyle, g, 0, it, is, a, dimensionless, parameter, characteristic, of, rockets, and, other, jet, engines, and, of, vehicles, propelled, by, such, engines, typically, space, launch, vehicles, and, jet, aircraft, if, the, thrust, to, weight, ratio, is, greater, than, the, local, gravity, strength, expressed, in, g, s, then, flight, can, occur, without, any, forward, motion, or, any, aerodynamic, lift, being, required, if, the, thrust, to, weight, ratio, times, the, lift, to, drag, ratio, is, greater, than, local, gravity, then, takeoff, using, aerodynamic, lift, is, possible, flight, dynamics, is, the, science, of, air, and, space, vehicle, orientation, and, control, in, three, dimensions, the, three, critical, flight, dynamics, parameters, are, the, angles, of, rotation, in, three, dimensions, about, the, vehicle, s, center, of, mass, known, as, pitch, roll, and, yaw, see, tait, bryan, rotations, for, an, explanation, the, control, of, these, dimensions, can, involve, a, horizontal, stabilizer, i, e, a, tail, ailerons, and, other, movable, aerodynamic, devices, which, control, angular, stability, i, e, flight, attitude, which, in, turn, affects, altitude, heading, wings, are, often, angled, slightly, upwards, they, have, positive, dihedral, angle, which, gives, inherent, roll, stabilization, to, create, thrust, so, as, to, be, able, to, gain, height, and, to, push, through, the, air, to, overcome, the, drag, associated, with, lift, all, takes, energy, different, objects, and, creatures, capable, of, flight, vary, in, the, efficiency, of, their, muscles, motors, and, how, well, this, translates, into, forward, thrust, propulsive, efficiency, determines, how, much, energy, vehicles, generate, from, a, unit, of, fuel, the, range, that, powered, flight, articles, can, achieve, is, ultimately, limited, by, their, drag, as, well, as, how, much, energy, they, can, store, on, board, and, how, efficiently, they, can, turn, that, energy, into, propulsion, for, powered, aircraft, the, useful, energy, is, determined, by, their, fuel, fraction, what, percentage, of, the, takeoff, weight, is, fuel, as, well, as, the, specific, energy, of, the, fuel, used, all, animals, and, devices, capable, of, sustained, flight, need, relatively, high, power, to, weight, ratios, to, be, able, to, generate, enough, lift, and, or, thrust, to, achieve, take, off, vehicles, that, can, fly, can, have, different, ways, to, takeoff, and, land, conventional, aircraft, accelerate, along, the, ground, until, sufficient, lift, is, generated, for, takeoff, and, reverse, the, process, for, landing, some, aircraft, can, take, off, at, low, speed, this, is, called, a, short, takeoff, some, aircraft, such, as, helicopters, and, harrier, jump, jets, can, take, off, and, land, vertically, rockets, also, usually, take, off, and, land, vertically, but, some, designs, can, land, horizontally, navigation, is, the, systems, necessary, to, calculate, current, position, e, g, compass, gps, loran, star, tracker, inertial, measurement, unit, and, altimeter, in, aircraft, successful, air, navigation, involves, piloting, an, aircraft, from, place, to, place, without, getting, lost, breaking, the, laws, applying, to, aircraft, or, endangering, the, safety, of, those, on, board, or, on, the, ground, the, techniques, used, for, navigation, in, the, air, will, depend, on, whether, the, aircraft, is, flying, under, the, visual, flight, rules, vfr, or, the, instrument, flight, rules, ifr, in, the, latter, case, the, pilot, will, navigate, exclusively, using, instruments, and, radio, navigation, aids, such, as, beacons, or, as, directed, under, radar, control, by, air, traffic, control, in, the, vfr, case, a, pilot, will, largely, navigate, using, dead, reckoning, combined, with, visual, observations, known, as, pilotage, with, reference, to, appropriate, maps, this, may, be, supplemented, using, radio, navigation, aids, a, guidance, system, is, a, device, or, group, of, devices, used, in, the, navigation, of, a, ship, aircraft, missile, rocket, satellite, or, other, moving, object, typically, guidance, is, responsible, for, the, calculation, of, the, vector, i, e, direction, velocity, toward, an, objective, a, conventional, fixed, wing, aircraft, flight, control, system, consists, of, flight, control, surfaces, the, respective, cockpit, controls, connecting, linkages, and, the, necessary, operating, mechanisms, to, control, an, aircraft, s, direction, in, flight, aircraft, engine, controls, are, also, considered, as, flight, controls, as, they, change, speed, in, the, case, of, aircraft, air, traffic, is, controlled, by, air, traffic, control, systems, collision, avoidance, is, the, process, of, controlling, spacecraft, to, try, to, prevent, collisions, air, safety, is, a, term, encompassing, the, theory, investigation, and, categorization, of, flight, failures, and, the, prevention, of, such, failures, through, regulation, education, and, training, it, can, also, be, applied, in, the, context, of, campaigns, that, inform, the, public, as, to, the, safety, of, air, travel, flight, travel, guide, from, wikivoyage
