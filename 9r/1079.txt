enthalpy, n, l, p, i, is, the, sum, of, a, thermodynamic, system, s, internal, energy, and, the, product, of, its, pressure, and, volume, it, is, a, state, function, in, thermodynamics, used, in, many, measurements, in, chemical, biological, and, physical, systems, at, a, constant, external, pressure, which, is, conveniently, provided, by, the, large, ambient, atmosphere, the, pressure, volume, term, expresses, the, work, w, displaystyle, w, that, was, done, against, constant, external, pressure, p, e, x, t, displaystyle, p, ext, to, establish, the, system, s, physical, dimensions, from, v, s, y, s, t, e, m, i, n, i, t, i, a, l, 0, displaystyle, v, system, initial, 0, to, some, final, volume, v, s, y, s, t, e, m, f, i, n, a, l, displaystyle, v, system, final, as, w, p, e, x, t, v, displaystyle, w, p, ext, delta, v, i, e, to, make, room, for, it, by, displacing, its, surroundings, the, pressure, volume, term, is, very, small, for, solids, and, liquids, at, common, conditions, and, fairly, small, for, gases, therefore, enthalpy, is, a, stand, in, for, energy, in, chemical, systems, bond, lattice, solvation, and, other, chemical, energies, are, actually, enthalpy, differences, as, a, state, function, enthalpy, depends, only, on, the, final, configuration, of, internal, energy, pressure, and, volume, not, on, the, path, taken, to, achieve, it, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, unit, of, measurement, for, enthalpy, is, the, joule, other, historical, conventional, units, still, in, use, include, the, calorie, and, the, british, thermal, unit, btu, the, total, enthalpy, of, a, system, cannot, be, measured, directly, because, the, internal, energy, contains, components, that, are, unknown, not, easily, accessible, or, are, not, of, interest, for, the, thermodynamic, problem, at, hand, in, practice, a, change, in, enthalpy, is, the, preferred, expression, for, measurements, at, constant, pressure, because, it, simplifies, the, description, of, energy, transfer, when, transfer, of, matter, into, or, out, of, the, system, is, also, prevented, and, no, electrical, or, mechanical, stirring, shaft, or, lift, pumping, work, is, done, at, constant, pressure, the, enthalpy, change, equals, the, energy, exchanged, with, the, environment, by, heat, in, chemistry, the, standard, enthalpy, of, reaction, is, the, enthalpy, change, when, reactants, in, their, standard, states, p, 1, bar, usually, t, 298, k, change, to, products, in, their, standard, states, this, quantity, is, the, standard, heat, of, reaction, at, constant, pressure, and, temperature, but, it, can, be, measured, by, calorimetric, methods, even, if, the, temperature, does, vary, during, the, measurement, provided, that, the, initial, and, final, pressure, and, temperature, correspond, to, the, standard, state, the, value, does, not, depend, on, the, path, from, initial, to, final, state, because, enthalpy, is, a, state, function, enthalpies, of, chemical, substances, are, usually, listed, for, 1, bar, 100, kpa, pressure, as, a, standard, state, enthalpies, and, enthalpy, changes, for, reactions, vary, as, a, function, of, temperature, but, tables, generally, list, the, standard, heats, of, formation, of, substances, at, 25, c, 298, k, for, endothermic, heat, absorbing, processes, the, change, h, is, a, positive, value, for, exothermic, heat, releasing, processes, it, is, negative, the, enthalpy, of, an, ideal, gas, is, independent, of, its, pressure, or, volume, and, depends, only, on, its, temperature, which, correlates, to, its, thermal, energy, real, gases, at, common, temperatures, and, pressures, often, closely, approximate, this, behavior, which, simplifies, practical, thermodynamic, design, and, analysis, the, word, enthalpy, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, enthalpein, which, means, to, heat, the, enthalpy, h, of, a, thermodynamic, system, is, defined, as, the, sum, of, its, internal, energy, and, the, product, of, its, pressure, and, volume, where, u, is, the, internal, energy, p, is, pressure, and, v, is, the, volume, of, the, system, p, v, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, pressure, energy, p, enthalpy, is, an, extensive, property, it, is, proportional, to, the, size, of, the, system, for, homogeneous, systems, as, intensive, properties, the, specific, enthalpy, h, h, m, is, referenced, to, a, unit, of, mass, m, of, the, system, and, the, molar, enthalpy, h, m, h, n, where, n, is, the, number, of, moles, for, inhomogeneous, systems, the, enthalpy, is, the, sum, of, the, enthalpies, of, the, component, subsystems, h, k, h, k, displaystyle, h, sum, k, h, k, where, a, closed, system, may, lie, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, in, a, static, gravitational, field, so, that, its, pressure, p, varies, continuously, with, altitude, while, because, of, the, equilibrium, requirement, its, temperature, t, is, invariant, with, altitude, correspondingly, the, system, s, gravitational, potential, energy, density, also, varies, with, altitude, then, the, enthalpy, summation, becomes, an, integral, h, h, d, v, displaystyle, h, int, left, rho, h, right, mathrm, d, v, where, the, integral, therefore, represents, the, sum, of, the, enthalpies, of, all, the, elements, of, the, volume, the, enthalpy, of, a, closed, homogeneous, system, is, its, energy, function, h, s, p, with, its, entropy, s, and, its, pressure, p, as, natural, state, variables, which, provide, a, differential, relation, for, d, h, of, the, simplest, form, derived, as, follows, we, start, from, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, for, closed, systems, for, an, infinitesimal, process, d, u, q, w, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, mathrm, delta, q, mathrm, delta, w, where, in, a, homogeneous, system, in, which, only, reversible, processes, or, pure, heat, transfer, are, considered, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, gives, q, t, d, s, with, t, the, absolute, temperature, and, d, s, the, infinitesimal, change, in, entropy, s, of, the, system, furthermore, if, only, p, v, work, is, done, w, p, d, v, as, a, result, d, u, t, d, s, p, d, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, t, mathrm, d, s, p, mathrm, d, v, adding, d, p, v, to, both, sides, of, this, expression, gives, d, u, d, p, v, t, d, s, p, d, v, d, p, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, mathrm, d, p, v, t, mathrm, d, s, p, mathrm, d, v, mathrm, d, p, v, or, d, u, p, v, t, d, s, v, d, p, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, p, v, t, mathrm, d, s, v, mathrm, d, p, so, d, h, s, p, t, d, s, v, d, p, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, s, p, t, mathrm, d, s, v, mathrm, d, p, and, the, coefficients, of, the, natural, variable, differentials, d, s, and, d, p, are, just, the, single, variables, t, and, v, the, above, expression, of, d, h, in, terms, of, entropy, and, pressure, may, be, unfamiliar, to, some, readers, there, are, also, expressions, in, terms, of, more, directly, measurable, variables, such, as, temperature, and, pressure, p, 88, d, h, c, p, d, t, v, 1, t, d, p, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, c, mathsf, p, mathrm, d, t, v, 1, alpha, t, mathrm, d, p, here, c, p, is, the, heat, capacity, at, constant, pressure, and, is, the, coefficient, of, cubic, thermal, expansion, 1, v, v, t, p, displaystyle, alpha, frac, 1, v, left, frac, partial, v, partial, t, right, mathsf, p, with, this, expression, one, can, in, principle, determine, the, enthalpy, if, c, p, and, v, are, known, as, functions, of, p, and, t, however, the, expression, is, more, complicated, than, d, h, t, d, s, v, d, p, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, t, mathrm, d, s, v, mathrm, d, p, because, t, is, not, a, natural, variable, for, the, enthalpy, h, at, constant, pressure, d, p, 0, displaystyle, mathrm, d, p, 0, so, that, d, h, c, p, d, t, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, c, mathsf, p, mathrm, d, t, for, an, ideal, gas, d, h, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, reduces, to, this, form, even, if, the, process, involves, a, pressure, change, because, t, 1, in, a, more, general, form, the, first, law, describes, the, internal, energy, with, additional, terms, involving, the, chemical, potential, and, the, number, of, particles, of, various, types, the, differential, statement, for, d, h, then, becomes, d, h, t, d, s, v, d, p, i, i, d, n, i, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, t, mathrm, d, s, v, mathrm, d, p, sum, i, mu, i, mathrm, d, n, i, where, i, is, the, chemical, potential, per, particle, for, a, type, i, particle, and, n, i, is, the, number, of, such, particles, the, last, term, can, also, be, written, as, i, d, n, i, with, d, n, i, 0, the, number, of, moles, of, component, i, added, to, the, system, and, in, this, case, i, the, molar, chemical, potential, or, as, i, d, m, i, with, d, m, i, the, mass, of, component, i, added, to, the, system, and, in, this, case, i, the, specific, chemical, potential, the, enthalpy, h, s, p, n, i, expresses, the, thermodynamics, of, a, system, in, the, energy, representation, as, a, function, of, state, its, arguments, include, both, one, intensive, and, several, extensive, state, variables, the, state, variables, s, p, and, n, i, are, said, to, be, the, natural, state, variables, in, this, representation, they, are, suitable, for, describing, processes, in, which, they, are, determined, by, factors, in, the, surroundings, for, example, when, a, virtual, parcel, of, atmospheric, air, moves, to, a, different, altitude, the, pressure, surrounding, it, changes, and, the, process, is, often, so, rapid, that, there, is, too, little, time, for, heat, transfer, this, is, the, basis, of, the, so, called, adiabatic, approximation, that, is, used, in, meteorology, conjugate, with, the, enthalpy, with, these, arguments, the, other, characteristic, function, of, state, of, a, thermodynamic, system, is, its, entropy, as, a, function, s, h, p, n, i, of, the, same, list, of, variables, of, state, except, that, the, entropy, s, is, replaced, in, the, list, by, the, enthalpy, h, it, expresses, the, entropy, representation, the, state, variables, h, p, and, n, i, are, said, to, be, the, natural, state, variables, in, this, representation, they, are, suitable, for, describing, processes, in, which, they, are, experimentally, controlled, for, example, h, and, p, can, be, controlled, by, allowing, heat, transfer, and, by, varying, only, the, external, pressure, on, the, piston, that, sets, the, volume, of, the, system, the, u, term, is, the, energy, of, the, system, and, the, p, v, term, can, be, interpreted, as, the, work, that, would, be, required, to, make, room, for, the, system, if, the, pressure, of, the, environment, remained, constant, when, a, system, for, example, n, moles, of, a, gas, of, volume, v, at, pressure, p, and, temperature, t, is, created, or, brought, to, its, present, state, from, absolute, zero, energy, must, be, supplied, equal, to, its, internal, energy, u, plus, p, v, where, p, v, is, the, work, done, in, pushing, against, the, ambient, atmospheric, pressure, in, physics, and, statistical, mechanics, it, may, be, more, interesting, to, study, the, internal, properties, of, a, constant, volume, system, and, therefore, the, internal, energy, is, used, in, chemistry, experiments, are, often, conducted, at, constant, atmospheric, pressure, and, the, pressure, volume, work, represents, a, small, well, defined, energy, exchange, with, the, atmosphere, so, that, h, is, the, appropriate, expression, for, the, heat, of, reaction, for, a, heat, engine, the, change, in, its, enthalpy, after, a, full, cycle, is, equal, to, zero, since, the, final, and, initial, state, are, equal, in, order, to, discuss, the, relation, between, the, enthalpy, increase, and, heat, supply, we, return, to, the, first, law, for, closed, systems, with, the, physics, sign, convention, d, u, q, w, where, the, heat, q, is, supplied, by, conduction, radiation, joule, heating, we, apply, it, to, the, special, case, with, a, constant, pressure, at, the, surface, in, this, case, the, work, is, given, by, p, d, v, where, p, is, the, pressure, at, the, surface, d, v, is, the, increase, of, the, volume, of, the, system, cases, of, long, range, electromagnetic, interaction, require, further, state, variables, in, their, formulation, and, are, not, considered, here, in, this, case, the, first, law, reads, d, u, q, p, d, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, mathrm, delta, q, p, mathrm, d, v, now, d, h, d, u, d, p, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, mathrm, d, u, mathrm, d, p, v, so, d, h, q, v, d, p, p, d, v, p, d, v, q, v, d, p, displaystyle, begin, aligned, mathrm, d, h, mathrm, delta, q, v, mathrm, d, p, p, mathrm, d, v, p, mathrm, d, v, mathrm, delta, q, v, mathrm, d, p, end, aligned, if, the, system, is, under, constant, pressure, d, p, 0, and, consequently, the, increase, in, enthalpy, of, the, system, is, equal, to, the, heat, added, d, h, q, displaystyle, mathrm, d, h, mathrm, delta, q, this, is, why, the, now, obsolete, term, heat, content, was, used, for, enthalpy, in, the, 19th, century, in, thermodynamics, one, can, calculate, enthalpy, by, determining, the, requirements, for, creating, a, system, from, nothingness, the, mechanical, work, required, p, v, differs, based, upon, the, conditions, that, obtain, during, the, creation, of, the, thermodynamic, system, energy, must, be, supplied, to, remove, particles, from, the, surroundings, to, make, space, for, the, creation, of, the, system, assuming, that, the, pressure, p, remains, constant, this, is, the, p, v, term, the, supplied, energy, must, also, provide, the, change, in, internal, energy, u, which, includes, activation, energies, ionization, energies, mixing, energies, vaporization, energies, chemical, bond, energies, and, so, forth, together, these, constitute, the, change, in, the, enthalpy, u, p, v, for, systems, at, constant, pressure, with, no, external, work, done, other, than, the, p, v, work, the, change, in, enthalpy, is, the, heat, received, by, the, system, for, a, simple, system, with, a, constant, number, of, particles, at, constant, pressure, the, difference, in, enthalpy, is, the, maximum, amount, of, thermal, energy, derivable, from, an, isobaric, thermodynamic, process, the, total, enthalpy, of, a, system, cannot, be, measured, directly, the, enthalpy, change, of, a, system, is, measured, instead, enthalpy, change, is, defined, by, the, following, equation, h, h, f, h, i, displaystyle, delta, h, h, mathsf, f, h, mathsf, i, where, for, an, exothermic, reaction, at, constant, pressure, the, system, s, change, in, enthalpy, h, is, negative, due, to, the, products, of, the, reaction, having, a, smaller, enthalpy, than, the, reactants, and, equals, the, heat, released, in, the, reaction, if, no, electrical, or, shaft, work, is, done, in, other, words, the, overall, decrease, in, enthalpy, is, achieved, by, the, generation, of, heat, conversely, for, a, constant, pressure, endothermic, reaction, h, is, positive, and, equal, to, the, heat, absorbed, in, the, reaction, from, the, definition, of, enthalpy, as, h, u, p, v, the, enthalpy, change, at, constant, pressure, is, h, u, p, v, however, for, most, chemical, reactions, the, work, term, p, v, is, much, smaller, than, the, internal, energy, change, u, which, is, approximately, equal, to, h, as, an, example, for, the, combustion, of, carbon, monoxide, 2, co, g, o, 2, g, 2, co, 2, g, h, 566, 0, kj, and, u, 563, 5, kj, since, the, differences, are, so, small, reaction, enthalpies, are, often, described, as, reaction, energies, and, analyzed, in, terms, of, bond, energies, the, specific, enthalpy, of, a, uniform, system, is, defined, as, h, h, m, where, m, is, the, mass, of, the, system, the, si, unit, for, specific, enthalpy, is, joule, per, kilogram, it, can, be, expressed, in, other, specific, quantities, by, h, u, p, v, where, u, is, the, specific, internal, energy, p, is, the, pressure, and, v, is, specific, volume, which, is, equal, to, 1, where, is, the, density, an, enthalpy, change, describes, the, change, in, enthalpy, observed, in, the, constituents, of, a, thermodynamic, system, when, undergoing, a, transformation, or, chemical, reaction, it, is, the, difference, between, the, enthalpy, after, the, process, has, completed, i, e, the, enthalpy, of, the, products, assuming, that, the, reaction, goes, to, completion, and, the, initial, enthalpy, of, the, system, namely, the, reactants, these, processes, are, specified, solely, by, their, initial, and, final, states, so, that, the, enthalpy, change, for, the, reverse, is, the, negative, of, that, for, the, forward, process, a, common, standard, enthalpy, change, is, the, enthalpy, of, formation, which, has, been, determined, for, a, large, number, of, substances, enthalpy, changes, are, routinely, measured, and, compiled, in, chemical, and, physical, reference, works, such, as, the, crc, handbook, of, chemistry, and, physics, the, following, is, a, selection, of, enthalpy, changes, commonly, recognized, in, thermodynamics, when, used, in, these, recognized, terms, the, qualifier, change, is, usually, dropped, and, the, property, is, simply, termed, enthalpy, of, process, since, these, properties, are, often, used, as, reference, values, it, is, very, common, to, quote, them, for, a, standardized, set, of, environmental, parameters, or, standard, conditions, including, for, such, standardized, values, the, name, of, the, enthalpy, is, commonly, prefixed, with, the, term,

d, u, d, t, may, be, set, equal, to, zero, this, yields, a, useful, expression, for, the, average, power, generation, for, these, devices, in, the, absence, of, chemical, reactions, p, k, q, k, k, h,

d, t, right, rangle, where, the, angle, brackets, denote, time, averages, the, technical, importance, of, the, enthalpy, is, directly, related, to, its, presence, in, the, first, law, for, open, systems, as, formulated, above, the, enthalpy, values, of, important, substances, can, be, obtained, using, commercial, software, practically, all, relevant, material, properties, can, be, obtained, either, in, tabular, or, in, graphical, form, there, are, many, types, of, diagrams, such, as, h, t, diagrams, which, give, the, specific, enthalpy, as, function, of, temperature, for, various, pressures, and, h, p, diagrams, which, give, h, as, function, of, p, for, various, t, one, of, the, most, common, diagrams, is, the, temperature, specific, entropy, diagram, t, s, diagram, it, gives, the, melting, curve, and, saturated, liquid, and, vapor, values, together, with, isobars, and, isenthalps, these, diagrams, are, powerful, tools, in, the, hands, of, the, thermal, engineer, the, points, a, through, h, in, the, figure, play, a, role, in, the, discussion, in, this, section, points, e, and, g, are, saturated, liquids, and, point, h, is, a, saturated, gas, one, of, the, simple, applications, of, the, concept, of, enthalpy, is, the, so, called, throttling, process, also, known, as, joule, thomson, expansion, it, concerns, a, steady, adiabatic, flow, of, a, fluid, through, a, flow, resistance, valve, porous, plug, or, any, other, type, of, flow, resistance, as, shown, in, the, figure, this, process, is, very, important, since, it, is, at, the, heart, of, domestic, refrigerators, where, it, is, responsible, for, the, temperature, drop, between, ambient, temperature, and, the, interior, of, the, refrigerator, it, is, also, the, final, stage, in, many, types, of, liquefiers, for, a, steady, state, flow, regime, the, enthalpy, of, the, system, dotted, rectangle, has, to, be, constant, hence, 0, m, h, 1, m, h, 2, displaystyle, 0, dot, m, h, 1, dot, m, h, 2, since, the, mass, flow, is, constant, the, specific, enthalpies, at, the, two, sides, of, the, flow, resistance, are, the, same, h, 1, h, 2, displaystyle, h, 1, h, 2, that, is, the, enthalpy, per, unit, mass, does, not, change, during, the, throttling, the, consequences, of, this, relation, can, be, demonstrated, using, the, t, s, diagram, above, point, c, is, at, 200, bar, and, room, temperature, 300, k, a, joule, thomson, expansion, from, 200, bar, to, 1, bar, follows, a, curve, of, constant, enthalpy, of, roughly, 425, kj, kg, not, shown, in, the, diagram, lying, between, the, 400, and, 450, kj, kg, isenthalps, and, ends, in, point, d, which, is, at, a, temperature, of, about, 270, k, hence, the, expansion, from, 200, bar, to, 1, bar, cools, nitrogen, from, 300, k, to, 270, k, in, the, valve, there, is, a, lot, of, friction, and, a, lot, of, entropy, is, produced, but, still, the, final, temperature, is, below, the, starting, value, point, e, is, chosen, so, that, it, is, on, the, saturated, liquid, line, with, h, 100, kj, kg, it, corresponds, roughly, with, p, 13, bar, and, t, 108, k, throttling, from, this, point, to, a, pressure, of, 1, bar, ends, in, the, two, phase, region, point, f, this, means, that, a, mixture, of, gas, and, liquid, leaves, the, throttling, valve, since, the, enthalpy, is, an, extensive, parameter, the, enthalpy, in, f, h, f, is, equal, to, the, enthalpy, in, g, h, g, multiplied, by, the, liquid, fraction, in, f, x, f, plus, the, enthalpy, in, h, h, h, multiplied, by, the, gas, fraction, in, f, 1, x, f, so, h, f, x, f, h, g, 1, x, f,

liquid, in, the, liquid, gas, mixture, that, leaves, the, throttling, valve, is, 64, a, power, p, is, applied, e, g, as, electrical, power, if, the, compression, is, adiabatic, the, gas, temperature, goes, up, in, the, reversible, case, it, would, be, at, constant, entropy, which, corresponds, with, a, vertical, line, in, the, t, s, diagram, for, example, compressing, nitrogen, from, 1, bar, point, a, to, 2, bar, point, b, would, result, in, a, temperature, increase, from, 300, k, to, 380, k, in, order, to, let, the, compressed, gas, exit, at, ambient, temperature, t, a, heat, exchange, e, g, by, cooling, water, is, necessary, in, the, ideal, case, the, compression, is, isothermal, the, average, heat, flow, to, the, surroundings, is, q, since, the, system, is, in, the, steady, state, the, first, law, gives, 0, q, m, h, 1, m, h, 2, p, displaystyle, 0, dot, q, dot, m, h, 1, dot, m, h, 2, p, the, minimal, power, needed, for, the, compression, is, realized, if, the, compression, is, reversible, in, that, case, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, for, open, systems, gives, 0, q, t, a, m, s, 1, m, s, 2, displaystyle, 0, frac, dot, q, t, mathsf, a, dot, m, s, 1, dot, m, s, 2, eliminating, q, gives, for, the, minimal, power, p, m, i, n, m, h, 2, h, 1, t, a, s, 2, s, 1, displaystyle, frac, p, mathsf, min, dot, m, h, 2, h, 1, t, mathsf, a, left, s, 2, s, 1, right, for, example, compressing, 1, kg, of, nitrogen, from, 1, bar, to, 200, bar, costs, at, least, h, c, h, a, t, a, s, c, s, a, with, the, data, obtained, with, the, t, s, diagram, we, find, a, value, of, 430, 461, 300, 5, 16, 6, 85, 476, kj, kg, the, relation, for, the, power, can, be, further, simplified, by, writing, it, as, p, m, i, n, m, 1, 2, d, h, t, a, d, s, displaystyle, frac, p, mathsf, min, dot, m, int, 1, 2, left, mathrm, d, h, t, mathsf, a, mathrm, d, s, right, with, this, results, in, the, final, relation, p, m, i, n, m, 1, 2, v, d, p, displaystyle, frac, p, mathsf, min, dot, m, int, 1, 2, v, mathrm, d, p, the, term, enthalpy, was, coined, relatively, late, in, the, history, of, thermodynamics, in, the, early, 20th, century, energy, was, introduced, in, a, modern, sense, by, thomas, young, in, 1802, while, entropy, by, rudolf, clausius, in, 1865, energy, uses, the, root, of, the, greek, word, ergon, meaning, work, to, express, the, idea, of, capacity, to, perform, work, entropy, uses, the, greek, word, trop, meaning, transformation, or, turning, enthalpy, uses, the, root, of, the, greek, word, thalpos, warmth, heat, the, term, expresses, the, obsolete, concept, of, heat, content, as, d, h, refers, to, the, amount, of, heat, gained, in, a, process, at, constant, pressure, only, but, not, in, the, general, case, when, pressure, is, variable, j, w, gibbs, used, the, term, a, heat, function, for, constant, pressure, for, clarity, introduction, of, the, concept, of, heat, content, h, is, associated, with, beno, t, paul, mile, clapeyron, and, rudolf, clausius, clausius, clapeyron, relation, 1850, the, term, enthalpy, first, appeared, in, print, in, 1909, it, is, attributed, to, heike, kamerlingh, onnes, who, most, likely, introduced, it, orally, the, year, before, at, the, first, meeting, of, the, institute, of, refrigeration, in, paris, it, gained, currency, only, in, the, 1920s, notably, with, the, mollier, steam, tables, and, diagrams, published, in, 1927, until, the, 1920s, the, symbol, h, was, used, somewhat, inconsistently, for, heat, in, general, the, definition, of, h, as, strictly, limited, to, enthalpy, or, heat, content, at, constant, pressure, was, formally, proposed, by, a, w, porter, in, 1922
