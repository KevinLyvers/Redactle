a, colloid, is, a, mixture, in, which, one, substance, consisting, of, microscopically, dispersed, insoluble, particles, is, suspended, throughout, another, substance, some, definitions, specify, that, the, particles, must, be, dispersed, in, a, liquid, while, others, extend, the, definition, to, include, substances, like, aerosols, and, gels, the, term, colloidal, suspension, refers, unambiguously, to, the, overall, mixture, although, a, narrower, sense, of, the, word, suspension, is, distinguished, from, colloids, by, larger, particle, size, a, colloid, has, a, dispersed, phase, the, suspended, particles, and, a, continuous, phase, the, medium, of, suspension, the, dispersed, phase, particles, have, a, diameter, of, approximately, 1, nanometre, to, 1, micrometre, some, colloids, are, translucent, because, of, the, tyndall, effect, which, is, the, scattering, of, light, by, particles, in, the, colloid, other, colloids, may, be, opaque, or, have, a, slight, color, colloidal, suspensions, are, the, subject, of, interface, and, colloid, science, this, field, of, study, began, in, 1845, by, francesco, selmi, who, called, them, pseudosolutions, and, expanded, by, michael, faraday, and, thomas, graham, who, coined, the, term, colloid, in, 1861, colloid, short, synonym, for, colloidal, system, colloidal, state, of, subdivision, such, that, the, molecules, or, polymolecular, particles, dispersed, in, a, medium, have, at, least, one, dimension, between, approximately, 1, nm, and, 1, m, or, that, in, a, system, discontinuities, are, found, at, distances, of, that, order, colloids, can, be, classified, as, follows, homogeneous, mixtures, with, a, dispersed, phase, in, this, size, range, may, be, called, colloidal, aerosols, colloidal, emulsions, colloidal, suspensions, colloidal, foams, colloidal, dispersions, or, hydrosols, hydrocolloids, describe, certain, chemicals, mostly, polysaccharides, and, proteins, that, are, colloidally, dispersible, in, water, thus, becoming, effectively, soluble, they, change, the, rheology, of, water, by, raising, the, viscosity, and, or, inducing, gelation, they, may, provide, other, interactive, effects, with, other, chemicals, in, some, cases, synergistic, in, others, antagonistic, using, these, attributes, hydrocolloids, are, very, useful, chemicals, since, in, many, areas, of, technology, from, foods, through, pharmaceuticals, personal, care, and, industrial, applications, they, can, provide, stabilization, destabilization, and, separation, gelation, flow, control, crystallization, control, and, numerous, other, effects, apart, from, uses, of, the, soluble, forms, some, of, the, hydrocolloids, have, additional, useful, functionality, in, a, dry, form, if, after, solubilization, they, have, the, water, removed, as, in, the, formation, of, films, for, breath, strips, or, sausage, casings, or, indeed, wound, dressing, fibers, some, being, more, compatible, with, skin, than, others, there, are, many, different, types, of, hydrocolloids, each, with, differences, in, structure, function, and, utility, that, generally, are, best, suited, to, particular, application, areas, in, the, control, of, rheology, and, the, physical, modification, of, form, and, texture, some, hydrocolloids, like, starch, and, casein, are, useful, foods, as, well, as, rheology, modifiers, others, have, limited, nutritive, value, usually, providing, a, source, of, fiber, the, term, hydrocolloids, also, refers, to, a, type, of, dressing, designed, to, lock, moisture, in, the, skin, and, help, the, natural, healing, process, of, skin, to, reduce, scarring, itching, and, soreness, hydrocolloids, contain, some, type, of, gel, forming, agent, such, as, sodium, carboxymethylcellulose, nacmc, and, gelatin, they, are, normally, combined, with, some, type, of, sealant, i, e, polyurethane, to, stick, to, the, skin, a, colloid, has, a, dispersed, phase, and, a, continuous, phase, whereas, in, a, solution, the, solute, and, solvent, constitute, only, one, phase, a, solute, in, a, solution, are, individual, molecules, or, ions, whereas, colloidal, particles, are, bigger, for, example, in, a, solution, of, salt, in, water, the, sodium, chloride, nacl, crystal, dissolves, and, the, na, and, cl, ions, are, surrounded, by, water, molecules, however, in, a, colloid, such, as, milk, the, colloidal, particles, are, globules, of, fat, rather, than, individual, fat, molecules, because, colloid, is, multiple, phases, it, has, very, different, properties, compared, to, fully, mixed, continuous, solution, the, following, forces, play, an, important, role, in, the, interaction, of, colloid, particles, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, acts, upon, colloidal, particles, therefore, if, the, colloidal, particles, are, denser, than, the, medium, of, suspension, they, will, sediment, fall, to, the, bottom, or, if, they, are, less, dense, they, will, cream, float, to, the, top, larger, particles, also, have, a, greater, tendency, to, sediment, because, they, have, smaller, brownian, motion, to, counteract, this, movement, the, sedimentation, or, creaming, velocity, is, found, by, equating, the, stokes, drag, force, with, the, gravitational, force, where, and, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, sedimentation, or, creaming, velocity, the, mass, of, the, colloidal, particle, is, found, using, where, and, 1, 2, displaystyle, rho, 1, rho, 2, is, the, difference, in, mass, density, between, the, colloidal, particle, and, the, suspension, medium, by, rearranging, the, sedimentation, or, creaming, velocity, is, there, is, an, upper, size, limit, for, the, diameter, of, colloidal, particles, because, particles, larger, than, 1, m, tend, to, sediment, and, thus, the, substance, would, no, longer, be, considered, a, colloidal, suspension, the, colloidal, particles, are, said, to, be, in, sedimentation, equilibrium, if, the, rate, of, sedimentation, is, equal, to, the, rate, of, movement, from, brownian, motion, there, are, two, principal, ways, to, prepare, colloids, the, stability, of, a, colloidal, system, is, defined, by, particles, remaining, suspended, in, solution, and, depends, on, the, interaction, forces, between, the, particles, these, include, electrostatic, interactions, and, van, der, waals, forces, because, they, both, contribute, to, the, overall, free, energy, of, the, system, a, colloid, is, stable, if, the, interaction, energy, due, to, attractive, forces, between, the, colloidal, particles, is, less, than, kt, where, k, is, the, boltzmann, constant, and, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, if, this, is, the, case, then, the, colloidal, particles, will, repel, or, only, weakly, attract, each, other, and, the, substance, will, remain, a, suspension, if, the, interaction, energy, is, greater, than, kt, the, attractive, forces, will, prevail, and, the, colloidal, particles, will, begin, to, clump, together, this, process, is, referred, to, generally, as, aggregation, but, is, also, referred, to, as, flocculation, coagulation, or, precipitation, while, these, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, for, some, definitions, they, have, slightly, different, meanings, for, example, coagulation, can, be, used, to, describe, irreversible, permanent, aggregation, where, the, forces, holding, the, particles, together, are, stronger, than, any, external, forces, caused, by, stirring, or, mixing, flocculation, can, be, used, to, describe, reversible, aggregation, involving, weaker, attractive, forces, and, the, aggregate, is, usually, called, a, floc, the, term, precipitation, is, normally, reserved, for, describing, a, phase, change, from, a, colloid, dispersion, to, a, solid, precipitate, when, it, is, subjected, to, a, perturbation, aggregation, causes, sedimentation, or, creaming, therefore, the, colloid, is, unstable, if, either, of, these, processes, occur, the, colloid, will, no, longer, be, a, suspension, electrostatic, stabilization, and, steric, stabilization, are, the, two, main, mechanisms, for, stabilization, against, aggregation, a, combination, of, the, two, mechanisms, is, also, possible, electrosteric, stabilization, a, method, called, gel, network, stabilization, represents, the, principal, way, to, produce, colloids, stable, to, both, aggregation, and, sedimentation, the, method, consists, in, adding, to, the, colloidal, suspension, a, polymer, able, to, form, a, gel, network, particle, settling, is, hindered, by, the, stiffness, of, the, polymeric, matrix, where, particles, are, trapped, and, the, long, polymeric, chains, can, provide, a, steric, or, electrosteric, stabilization, to, dispersed, particles, examples, of, such, substances, are, xanthan, and, guar, gum, destabilization, can, be, accomplished, by, different, methods, unstable, colloidal, suspensions, of, low, volume, fraction, form, clustered, liquid, suspensions, wherein, individual, clusters, of, particles, sediment, if, they, are, more, dense, than, the, suspension, medium, or, cream, if, they, are, less, dense, however, colloidal, suspensions, of, higher, volume, fraction, form, colloidal, gels, with, viscoelastic, properties, viscoelastic, colloidal, gels, such, as, bentonite, and, toothpaste, flow, like, liquids, under, shear, but, maintain, their, shape, when, shear, is, removed, it, is, for, this, reason, that, toothpaste, can, be, squeezed, from, a, toothpaste, tube, but, stays, on, the, toothbrush, after, it, is, applied, the, most, widely, used, technique, to, monitor, the, dispersion, state, of, a, product, and, to, identify, and, quantify, destabilization, phenomena, is, multiple, light, scattering, coupled, with, vertical, scanning, this, method, known, as, turbidimetry, is, based, on, measuring, the, fraction, of, light, that, after, being, sent, through, the, sample, it, backscattered, by, the, colloidal, particles, the, backscattering, intensity, is, directly, proportional, to, the, average, particle, size, and, volume, fraction, of, the, dispersed, phase, therefore, local, changes, in, concentration, caused, by, sedimentation, or, creaming, and, clumping, together, of, particles, caused, by, aggregation, are, detected, and, monitored, these, phenomena, are, associated, with, unstable, colloids, dynamic, light, scattering, can, be, used, to, detect, the, size, of, a, colloidal, particle, by, measuring, how, fast, they, diffuse, this, method, involves, directing, laser, light, towards, a, colloid, the, scattered, light, will, form, an, interference, pattern, and, the, fluctuation, in, light, intensity, in, this, pattern, is, caused, by, the, brownian, motion, of, the, particles, if, the, apparent, size, of, the, particles, increases, due, to, them, clumping, together, via, aggregation, it, will, result, in, slower, brownian, motion, this, technique, can, confirm, that, aggregation, has, occurred, if, the, apparent, particle, size, is, determined, to, be, beyond, the, typical, size, range, for, colloidal, particles, the, kinetic, process, of, destabilisation, can, be, rather, long, up, to, several, months, or, years, for, some, products, thus, it, is, often, required, for, the, formulator, to, use, further, accelerating, methods, to, reach, reasonable, development, time, for, new, product, design, thermal, methods, are, the, most, commonly, used, and, consist, of, increasing, temperature, to, accelerate, destabilisation, below, critical, temperatures, of, phase, inversion, or, chemical, degradation, temperature, affects, not, only, viscosity, but, also, interfacial, tension, in, the, case, of, non, ionic, surfactants, or, more, generally, interactions, forces, inside, the, system, storing, a, dispersion, at, high, temperatures, enables, to, simulate, real, life, conditions, for, a, product, e, g, tube, of, sunscreen, cream, in, a, car, in, the, summer, but, also, to, accelerate, destabilisation, processes, up, to, 200, times, mechanical, acceleration, including, vibration, centrifugation, and, agitation, are, sometimes, used, they, subject, the, product, to, different, forces, that, pushes, the, particles, droplets, against, one, another, hence, helping, in, the, film, drainage, some, emulsions, would, never, coalesce, in, normal, gravity, while, they, do, under, artificial, gravity, segregation, of, different, populations, of, particles, have, been, highlighted, when, using, centrifugation, and, vibration, in, physics, colloids, are, an, interesting, model, system, for, atoms, micrometre, scale, colloidal, particles, are, large, enough, to, be, observed, by, optical, techniques, such, as, confocal, microscopy, many, of, the, forces, that, govern, the, structure, and, behavior, of, matter, such, as, excluded, volume, interactions, or, electrostatic, forces, govern, the, structure, and, behavior, of, colloidal, suspensions, for, example, the, same, techniques, used, to, model, ideal, gases, can, be, applied, to, model, the, behavior, of, a, hard, sphere, colloidal, suspension, phase, transitions, in, colloidal, suspensions, can, be, studied, in, real, time, using, optical, techniques, and, are, analogous, to, phase, transitions, in, liquids, in, many, interesting, cases, optical, fluidity, is, used, to, control, colloid, suspensions, a, colloidal, crystal, is, a, highly, ordered, array, of, particles, that, can, be, formed, over, a, very, long, range, typically, on, the, order, of, a, few, millimeters, to, one, centimeter, and, that, appear, analogous, to, their, atomic, or, molecular, counterparts, one, of, the, finest, natural, examples, of, this, ordering, phenomenon, can, be, found, in, precious, opal, in, which, brilliant, regions, of, pure, spectral, color, result, from, close, packed, domains, of, amorphous, colloidal, spheres, of, silicon, dioxide, or, silica, sio, 2, these, spherical, particles, precipitate, in, highly, siliceous, pools, in, australia, and, elsewhere, and, form, these, highly, ordered, arrays, after, years, of, sedimentation, and, compression, under, hydrostatic, and, gravitational, forces, the, periodic, arrays, of, submicrometre, spherical, particles, provide, similar, arrays, of, interstitial, voids, which, act, as, a, natural, diffraction, grating, for, visible, light, waves, particularly, when, the, interstitial, spacing, is, of, the, same, order, of, magnitude, as, the, incident, lightwave, thus, it, has, been, known, for, many, years, that, due, to, repulsive, coulombic, interactions, electrically, charged, macromolecules, in, an, aqueous, environment, can, exhibit, long, range, crystal, like, correlations, with, interparticle, separation, distances, often, being, considerably, greater, than, the, individual, particle, diameter, in, all, of, these, cases, in, nature, the, same, brilliant, iridescence, or, play, of, colors, can, be, attributed, to, the, diffraction, and, constructive, interference, of, visible, lightwaves, that, satisfy, bragg, s, law, in, a, matter, analogous, to, the, scattering, of, x, rays, in, crystalline, solids, the, large, number, of, experiments, exploring, the, physics, and, chemistry, of, these, so, called, colloidal, crystals, has, emerged, as, a, result, of, the, relatively, simple, methods, that, have, evolved, in, the, last, 20, years, for, preparing, synthetic, monodisperse, colloids, both, polymer, and, mineral, and, through, various, mechanisms, implementing, and, preserving, their, long, range, order, formation, colloidal, phase, separation, is, an, important, organising, principle, for, compartmentalisation, of, both, the, cytoplasm, and, nucleus, of, cells, into, biomolecular, condensates, similar, in, importance, to, compartmentalisation, via, lipid, bilayer, membranes, a, type, of, liquid, crystal, the, term, biomolecular, condensate, has, been, used, to, refer, to, clusters, of, macromolecules, that, arise, via, liquid, liquid, or, liquid, solid, phase, separation, within, cells, macromolecular, crowding, strongly, enhances, colloidal, phase, separation, and, formation, of, biomolecular, condensates, colloidal, particles, can, also, serve, as, transport, vector, of, diverse, contaminants, in, the, surface, water, sea, water, lakes, rivers, fresh, water, bodies, and, in, underground, water, circulating, in, fissured, rocks, e, g, limestone, sandstone, granite, radionuclides, and, heavy, metals, easily, sorb, onto, colloids, suspended, in, water, various, types, of, colloids, are, recognised, inorganic, colloids, e, g, clay, particles, silicates, iron, oxy, hydroxides, organic, colloids, humic, and, fulvic, substances, when, heavy, metals, or, radionuclides, form, their, own, pure, colloids, the, term, eigencolloid, is, used, to, designate, pure, phases, i, e, pure, tc, oh, 4, u, oh, 4, or, am, oh, 3, colloids, have, been, suspected, for, the, long, range, transport, of, plutonium, on, the, nevada, nuclear, test, site, they, have, been, the, subject, of, detailed, studies, for, many, years, however, the, mobility, of, inorganic, colloids, is, very, low, in, compacted, bentonites, and, in, deep, clay, formations, because, of, the, process, of, ultrafiltration, occurring, in, dense, clay, membrane, the, question, is, less, clear, for, small, organic, colloids, often, mixed, in, porewater, with, truly, dissolved, organic, molecules, in, soil, science, the, colloidal, fraction, in, soils, consists, of, tiny, clay, and, humus, particles, that, are, less, than, 1, m, in, diameter, and, carry, either, positive, and, or, negative, electrostatic, charges, that, vary, depending, on, the, chemical, conditions, of, the, soil, sample, i, e, soil, ph, colloid, solutions, used, in, intravenous, therapy, belong, to, a, major, group, of, volume, expanders, and, can, be, used, for, intravenous, fluid, replacement, colloids, preserve, a, high, colloid, osmotic, pressure, in, the, blood, and, therefore, they, should, theoretically, preferentially, increase, the, intravascular, volume, whereas, other, types, of, volume, expanders, called, crystalloids, also, increase, the, interstitial, volume, and, intracellular, volume, however, there, is, still, controversy, to, the, actual, difference, in, efficacy, by, this, difference, and, much, of, the, research, related, to, this, use, of, colloids, is, based, on, fraudulent, research, by, joachim, boldt, another, difference, is, that, crystalloids, generally, are, much, cheaper, than, colloids
