in, electronics, gain, is, a, measure, of, the, ability, of, a, two, port, circuit, often, an, amplifier, to, increase, the, power, or, amplitude, of, a, signal, from, the, input, to, the, output, port, by, adding, energy, converted, from, some, power, supply, to, the, signal, it, is, usually, defined, as, the, mean, ratio, of, the, signal, amplitude, or, power, at, the, output, port, to, the, amplitude, or, power, at, the, input, port, it, is, often, expressed, using, the, logarithmic, decibel, db, units, db, gain, a, gain, greater, than, one, greater, than, zero, db, that, is, amplification, is, the, defining, property, of, an, active, component, or, circuit, while, a, passive, circuit, will, have, a, gain, of, less, than, one, the, term, gain, alone, is, ambiguous, and, can, refer, to, the, ratio, of, output, to, input, voltage, voltage, gain, current, current, gain, or, electric, power, power, gain, in, the, field, of, audio, and, general, purpose, amplifiers, especially, operational, amplifiers, the, term, usually, refers, to, voltage, gain, but, in, radio, frequency, amplifiers, it, usually, refers, to, power, gain, furthermore, the, term, gain, is, also, applied, in, systems, such, as, sensors, where, the, input, and, output, have, different, units, in, such, cases, the, gain, units, must, be, specified, as, in, 5, microvolts, per, photon, for, the, responsivity, of, a, photosensor, the, gain, of, a, bipolar, transistor, normally, refers, to, forward, current, transfer, ratio, either, h, fe, beta, the, static, ratio, of, i, c, divided, by, i, b, at, some, operating, point, or, sometimes, h, fe, the, small, signal, current, gain, the, slope, of, the, graph, of, i, c, against, i, b, at, a, point, the, gain, of, an, electronic, device, or, circuit, generally, varies, with, the, frequency, of, the, applied, signal, unless, otherwise, stated, the, term, refers, to, the, gain, for, frequencies, in, the, passband, the, intended, operating, frequency, range, of, the, equipment, the, term, gain, has, a, different, meaning, in, antenna, design, antenna, gain, is, the, ratio, of, radiation, intensity, from, a, directional, antenna, to, p, in, 4, displaystyle, p, text, in, 4, pi, mean, radiation, intensity, from, a, lossless, antenna, power, gain, in, decibels, db, is, defined, as, follows, where, p, in, displaystyle, p, text, in, is, the, power, applied, to, the, input, p, out, displaystyle, p, text, out, is, the, power, from, the, output, a, similar, calculation, can, be, done, using, a, natural, logarithm, instead, of, a, decimal, logarithm, resulting, in, nepers, instead, of, decibels, the, power, gain, can, be, calculated, using, voltage, instead, of, power, using, joule, s, first, law, p, v, 2, r, displaystyle, p, v, 2, r, the, formula, is, in, many, cases, the, input, impedance, r, in, displaystyle, r, text, in, and, output, impedance, r, out, displaystyle, r, text, out, are, equal, so, the, above, equation, can, be, simplified, to, this, simplified, formula, the, 20, log, rule, is, used, to, calculate, a, voltage, gain, in, decibels, and, is, equivalent, to, a, power, gain, if, and, only, if, the, impedances, at, input, and, output, are, equal, in, the, same, way, when, power, gain, is, calculated, using, current, instead, of, power, making, the, substitution, p, i, 2, r, displaystyle, p, i, 2, r, the, formula, is, in, many, cases, the, input, and, output, impedances, are, equal, so, the, above, equation, can, be, simplified, to, this, simplified, formula, is, used, to, calculate, a, current, gain, in, decibels, and, is, equivalent, to, the, power, gain, if, and, only, if, the, impedances, at, input, and, output, are, equal, the, current, gain, of, a, bipolar, transistor, h, fe, displaystyle, h, text, fe, or, h, fe, displaystyle, h, text, fe, is, normally, given, as, a, dimensionless, number, the, ratio, of, i, c, displaystyle, i, text, c, to, i, b, displaystyle, i, text, b, or, slope, of, the, i, c, displaystyle, i, text, c, versus, i, b, displaystyle, i, text, b, graph, for, h, fe, displaystyle, h, text, fe, in, the, cases, above, gain, will, be, a, dimensionless, quantity, as, it, is, the, ratio, of, like, units, decibels, are, not, used, as, units, but, rather, as, a, method, of, indicating, a, logarithmic, relationship, in, the, bipolar, transistor, example, it, is, the, ratio, of, the, output, current, to, the, input, current, both, measured, in, amperes, in, the, case, of, other, devices, the, gain, will, have, a, value, in, si, units, such, is, the, case, with, the, operational, transconductance, amplifier, which, has, an, open, loop, gain, transconductance, in, siemens, mhos, because, the, gain, is, a, ratio, of, the, output, current, to, the, input, voltage, q, an, amplifier, has, an, input, impedance, of, 50, ohms, and, drives, a, load, of, 50, ohms, when, its, input, v, in, displaystyle, v, text, in, is, 1, volt, its, output, v, out, displaystyle, v, text, out, is, 10, volts, what, is, its, voltage, and, power, gain, a, voltage, gain, is, simply, the, units, v, v, are, optional, but, make, it, clear, that, this, figure, is, a, voltage, gain, and, not, a, power, gain, using, the, expression, for, power, p, v, 2, r, the, power, gain, is, again, the, units, w, w, are, optional, power, gain, is, more, usually, expressed, in, decibels, thus, a, gain, of, factor, 1, equivalent, to, 0, db, where, both, input, and, output, are, at, the, same, voltage, level, and, impedance, is, also, known, as, unity, gain
