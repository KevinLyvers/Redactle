the, haloalkanes, also, known, as, halogenoalkanes, or, alkyl, halides, are, alkanes, containing, one, or, more, halogen, substituents, they, are, a, subset, of, the, general, class, of, halocarbons, although, the, distinction, is, not, often, made, haloalkanes, are, widely, used, commercially, they, are, used, as, flame, retardants, fire, extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and, pharmaceuticals, subsequent, to, the, widespread, use, in, commerce, many, halocarbons, have, also, been, shown, to, be, serious, pollutants, and, toxins, for, example, the, chlorofluorocarbons, have, been, shown, to, lead, to, ozone, depletion, methyl, bromide, is, a, controversial, fumigant, only, haloalkanes, that, contain, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, are, a, threat, to, the, ozone, layer, but, fluorinated, volatile, haloalkanes, in, theory, may, have, activity, as, greenhouse, gases, methyl, iodide, a, naturally, occurring, substance, however, does, not, have, ozone, depleting, properties, and, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, has, designated, the, compound, a, non, ozone, layer, depleter, for, more, information, see, halomethane, haloalkane, or, alkyl, halides, are, the, compounds, which, have, the, general, formula, rx, where, r, is, an, alkyl, or, substituted, alkyl, group, and, x, is, a, halogen, f, cl, br, i, haloalkanes, have, been, known, for, centuries, chloroethane, was, produced, in, the, 15th, century, the, systematic, synthesis, of, such, compounds, developed, in, the, 19th, century, in, step, with, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, and, the, understanding, of, the, structure, of, alkanes, methods, were, developed, for, the, selective, formation, of, c, halogen, bonds, especially, versatile, methods, included, the, addition, of, halogens, to, alkenes, hydrohalogenation, of, alkenes, and, the, conversion, of, alcohols, to, alkyl, halides, these, methods, are, so, reliable, and, so, easily, implemented, that, haloalkanes, became, cheaply, available, for, use, in, industrial, chemistry, because, the, halide, could, be, further, replaced, by, other, functional, groups, while, many, haloalkanes, are, human, produced, substantial, amounts, are, biogenic, from, the, structural, perspective, haloalkanes, can, be, classified, according, to, the, connectivity, of, the, carbon, atom, to, which, the, halogen, is, attached, in, primary, 1, haloalkanes, the, carbon, that, carries, the, halogen, atom, is, only, attached, to, one, other, alkyl, group, an, example, is, chloroethane, ch, 3, ch, 2, cl, in, secondary, 2, haloalkanes, the, carbon, that, carries, the, halogen, atom, has, two, c, c, bonds, in, tertiary, 3, haloalkanes, the, carbon, that, carries, the, halogen, atom, has, three, c, c, bonds, haloalkanes, can, also, be, classified, according, to, the, type, of, halogen, on, group, 17, responding, to, a, specific, halogenoalkane, haloalkanes, containing, carbon, bonded, to, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, results, in, organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine, and, organoiodine, compounds, respectively, compounds, containing, more, than, one, kind, of, halogen, are, also, possible, several, classes, of, widely, used, haloalkanes, are, classified, in, this, way, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hcfcs, and, hydrofluorocarbons, hfcs, these, abbreviations, are, particularly, common, in, discussions, of, the, environmental, impact, of, haloalkanes, haloalkanes, generally, resemble, the, parent, alkanes, in, being, colorless, relatively, odorless, and, hydrophobic, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, chloro, bromo, and, iodoalkanes, are, higher, than, the, analogous, alkanes, scaling, with, the, atomic, weight, and, number, of, halides, this, effect, is, due, to, the, increased, strength, of, the, intermolecular, forces, from, london, dispersion, to, dipole, dipole, interaction, because, of, the, increased, polarizability, thus, tetraiodomethane, ci, 4, is, a, solid, whereas, tetrachloromethane, ccl, 4, is, a, liquid, many, fluoroalkanes, however, go, against, this, trend, and, have, lower, melting, and, boiling, points, than, their, nonfluorinated, analogues, due, to, the, decreased, polarizability, of, fluorine, for, example, methane, ch, 4, has, a, melting, point, of, 182, 5, c, whereas, tetrafluoromethane, cf, 4, has, a, melting, point, of, 183, 6, c, as, they, contain, fewer, c, h, bonds, haloalkanes, are, less, flammable, than, alkanes, and, some, are, used, in, fire, extinguishers, haloalkanes, are, better, solvents, than, the, corresponding, alkanes, because, of, their, increased, polarity, haloalkanes, containing, halogens, other, than, fluorine, are, more, reactive, than, the, parent, alkanes, it, is, this, reactivity, that, is, the, basis, of, most, controversies, many, are, alkylating, agents, with, primary, haloalkanes, and, those, containing, heavier, halogens, being, the, most, active, fluoroalkanes, do, not, act, as, alkylating, agents, under, normal, conditions, the, ozone, depleting, abilities, of, the, cfcs, arises, from, the, photolability, of, the, c, cl, bond, an, estimated, 4, 100, 000, 000, kg, of, chloromethane, are, produced, annually, by, natural, sources, the, oceans, are, estimated, to, release, 1, to, 2, million, tons, of, bromomethane, annually, the, formal, naming, of, haloalkanes, should, follow, iupac, nomenclature, which, put, the, halogen, as, a, prefix, to, the, alkane, for, example, ethane, with, bromine, becomes, bromoethane, methane, with, four, chlorine, groups, becomes, tetrachloromethane, however, many, of, these, compounds, have, already, an, established, trivial, name, which, is, endorsed, by, the, iupac, nomenclature, for, example, chloroform, trichloromethane, and, methylene, chloride, dichloromethane, but, nowadays, iupac, nomenclature, is, used, to, reduce, confusion, this, article, follows, the, systematic, naming, scheme, throughout, haloalkanes, can, be, produced, from, virtually, all, organic, precursors, from, the, perspective, of, industry, the, most, important, ones, are, alkanes, and, alkenes, alkanes, react, with, halogens, by, free, radical, halogenation, in, this, reaction, a, hydrogen, atom, is, removed, from, the, alkane, then, replaced, by, a, halogen, atom, by, reaction, with, a, diatomic, halogen, molecule, free, radical, halogenation, typically, produces, a, mixture, of, compounds, mono, or, multihalogenated, at, various, positions, in, hydrohalogenation, an, alkene, reacts, with, a, dry, hydrogen, halide, hx, electrophile, like, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, or, hydrogen, bromide, hbr, to, form, a, mono, haloalkane, the, double, bond, of, the, alkene, is, replaced, by, two, new, bonds, one, with, the, halogen, and, one, with, the, hydrogen, atom, of, the, hydrohalic, acid, markovnikov, s, rule, states, that, under, normal, conditions, hydrogen, is, attached, to, the, unsaturated, carbon, with, the, most, hydrogen, substituents, the, rule, is, violated, when, neighboring, functional, groups, polarize, the, multiple, bond, or, in, certain, additions, of, hydrogen, bromide, addition, in, the, presence, of, peroxides, and, the, wohl, ziegler, reaction, which, occur, by, a, free, radical, mechanism, alkenes, also, react, with, halogens, x, 2, to, form, haloalkanes, with, two, neighboring, halogen, atoms, in, a, halogen, addition, reaction, alkynes, react, similarly, forming, the, tetrahalo, compounds, this, is, sometimes, known, as, decolorizing, the, halogen, since, the, reagent, x, 2, is, colored, and, the, product, is, usually, colorless, and, odorless, alcohol, can, be, converted, to, haloalkanes, direct, reaction, with, a, hydrohalic, acid, rarely, gives, a, pure, product, instead, generating, ethers, however, some, exceptions, are, known, ionic, liquids, suppress, the, formation, or, promote, the, cleavage, of, ethers, hydrochloric, acid, converts, tertiary, alcohols, to, choloroalkanes, and, primary, and, secondary, alcohols, convert, similarly, in, the, presence, of, a, lewis, acid, activator, such, as, zinc, chloride, the, latter, is, exploited, in, the, lucas, test, in, the, laboratory, more, active, deoxygenating, and, halogenating, agents, combine, with, base, to, effect, the, conversion, in, the, darzens, halogenation, thionyl, chloride, socl, 2, with, pyridine, converts, less, reactive, alcohols, to, chlorides, both, phosphorus, pentachloride, pcl, 5, and, phosphorus, trichloride, pcl, 3, function, similarly, and, alcohols, convert, to, bromoalkanes, under, hydrobromic, acid, or, phosphorus, tribromide, pbr, 3, the, heavier, halogens, do, not, require, preformed, reagents, a, catalytic, amount, of, pbr, 3, may, be, used, for, the, transformation, using, phosphorus, and, bromine, pbr, 3, is, formed, in, situ, iodoalkanes, may, similarly, be, prepared, using, red, phosphorus, and, iodine, equivalent, to, phosphorus, triiodide, one, family, of, named, reactions, relies, on, the, deoxygenating, effect, of, triphenylphosphine, in, the, appel, reaction, the, reagent, is, tetrahalomethane, and, triphenylphosphine, the, co, products, are, haloform, and, triphenylphosphine, oxide, in, the, mitsunobu, reaction, the, reagents, are, any, nucleophile, triphenylphosphine, and, a, diazodicarboxylate, the, coproducts, are, triphenyl, phosphine, oxide, and, a, hydrazodiamide, two, methods, for, the, synthesis, of, haloalkanes, from, carboxylic, acids, are, hunsdiecker, reaction, and, kochi, reaction, many, chloro, and, bromoalkanes, are, formed, naturally, the, principal, pathways, involve, the, enzymes, chloroperoxidase, and, bromoperoxidase, primary, aromatic, amines, yield, diazonium, ions, in, a, solution, of, sodium, nitrite, upon, heating, this, solution, with, copper, i, chloride, the, diazonium, group, is, replaced, by, cl, this, is, a, comparatively, easy, method, to, make, aryl, halides, as, the, gaseous, product, can, be, separated, easily, from, aryl, halide, when, an, iodide, is, to, be, made, copper, chloride, is, not, needed, addition, of, potassium, iodide, with, gentle, shaking, produces, the, haloalkane, haloalkanes, are, reactive, towards, nucleophiles, they, are, polar, molecules, the, carbon, to, which, the, halogen, is, attached, is, slightly, electropositive, where, the, halogen, is, slightly, electronegative, this, results, in, an, electron, deficient, electrophilic, carbon, which, inevitably, attracts, nucleophiles, substitution, reactions, involve, the, replacement, of, the, halogen, with, another, molecule, thus, leaving, saturated, hydrocarbons, as, well, as, the, halogenated, product, haloalkanes, behave, as, the, r, synthon, and, readily, react, with, nucleophiles, hydrolysis, a, reaction, in, which, water, breaks, a, bond, is, a, good, example, of, the, nucleophilic, nature, of, haloalkanes, the, polar, bond, attracts, a, hydroxide, ion, oh, naoh, aq, being, a, common, source, of, this, ion, this, oh, is, a, nucleophile, with, a, clearly, negative, charge, as, it, has, excess, electrons, it, donates, them, to, the, carbon, which, results, in, a, covalent, bond, between, the, two, thus, c, x, is, broken, by, heterolytic, fission, resulting, in, a, halide, ion, x, as, can, be, seen, the, oh, is, now, attached, to, the, alkyl, group, creating, an, alcohol, hydrolysis, of, bromoethane, for, example, yields, ethanol, reactions, with, ammonia, give, primary, amines, chloro, and, bromoalkanes, are, readily, substituted, by, iodide, in, the, finkelstein, reaction, the, iodoalkanes, produced, easily, undergo, further, reaction, sodium, iodide, is, used, as, a, catalyst, haloalkanes, react, with, ionic, nucleophiles, e, g, cyanide, thiocyanate, azide, the, halogen, is, replaced, by, the, respective, group, this, is, of, great, synthetic, utility, chloroalkanes, are, often, inexpensively, available, for, example, after, undergoing, substitution, reactions, cyanoalkanes, may, be, hydrolyzed, to, carboxylic, acids, or, reduced, to, primary, amines, using, lithium, aluminium, hydride, azoalkanes, may, be, reduced, to, primary, amines, by, staudinger, reduction, or, lithium, aluminium, hydride, amines, may, also, be, prepared, from, alkyl, halides, in, amine, alkylation, gabriel, synthesis, and, delepine, reaction, by, undergoing, nucleophilic, substitution, with, potassium, phthalimide, or, hexamine, respectively, followed, by, hydrolysis, in, the, presence, of, a, base, haloalkanes, alkylate, alcohols, amines, and, thiols, to, obtain, ethers, n, substituted, amines, and, thioethers, respectively, they, are, substituted, by, grignard, reagent, to, give, magnesium, salts, and, an, extended, alkyl, compound, in, dehydrohalogenation, reactions, the, halogen, and, an, adjacent, proton, are, removed, from, halocarbons, thus, forming, an, alkene, for, example, with, bromoethane, and, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, in, ethanol, the, hydroxide, ion, ho, abstracts, a, hydrogen, atom, a, bromide, ion, is, then, lost, resulting, in, ethene, h, 2, o, and, nabr, thus, haloalkanes, can, be, converted, to, alkenes, similarly, dihaloalkanes, can, be, converted, to, alkynes, in, related, reactions, 1, 2, dibromocompounds, are, debrominated, by, zinc, dust, to, give, alkenes, and, geminal, dihalides, can, react, with, strong, bases, to, give, carbenes, haloalkanes, undergo, free, radical, reactions, with, elemental, magnesium, to, give, alkyl, magnesium, compound, grignard, reagent, haloalkanes, also, react, with, lithium, metal, to, give, organolithium, compounds, both, grignard, reagents, and, organolithium, compounds, behave, as, the, r, synthon, alkali, metals, such, as, sodium, and, lithium, are, able, to, cause, haloalkanes, to, couple, in, wurtz, reaction, giving, symmetrical, alkanes, haloalkanes, especially, iodoalkanes, also, undergo, oxidative, addition, reactions, to, give, organometallic, compounds, chlorinated, or, fluorinated, alkenes, undergo, polymerization, important, halogenated, polymers, include, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, and, polytetrafluoroethene, ptfe, or, teflon, nature, produces, massive, amounts, of, chloromethane, and, bromomethane, most, concern, focuses, on, anthropogenic, sources, which, are, potential, toxins, even, carcinogens, similarly, great, interest, has, been, shown, in, remediation, of, man, made, halocarbons, such, as, those, produced, on, large, scale, such, as, dry, cleaning, fluids, volatile, halocarbons, degrade, photochemically, because, the, carbon, halogen, bond, can, be, labile, some, microorganisms, dehalogenate, halocarbons, while, this, behavior, is, intriguing, the, rates, of, remediation, are, generally, very, slow, as, alkylating, agents, haloalkanes, are, potential, carcinogens, the, more, reactive, members, of, this, large, class, of, compounds, generally, pose, greater, risk, e, g, carbon, tetrachloride
