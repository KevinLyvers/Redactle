in, a, chemical, reaction, chemical, equilibrium, is, the, state, in, which, both, the, reactants, and, products, are, present, in, concentrations, which, have, no, further, tendency, to, change, with, time, so, that, there, is, no, observable, change, in, the, properties, of, the, system, this, state, results, when, the, forward, reaction, proceeds, at, the, same, rate, as, the, reverse, reaction, the, reaction, rates, of, the, forward, and, backward, reactions, are, generally, not, zero, but, they, are, equal, thus, there, are, no, net, changes, in, the, concentrations, of, the, reactants, and, products, such, a, state, is, known, as, dynamic, equilibrium, the, concept, of, chemical, equilibrium, was, developed, in, 1803, after, berthollet, found, that, some, chemical, reactions, are, reversible, for, any, reaction, mixture, to, exist, at, equilibrium, the, rates, of, the, forward, and, backward, reverse, reactions, must, be, equal, in, the, following, chemical, equation, arrows, point, both, ways, to, indicate, equilibrium, a, and, b, are, reactant, chemical, species, s, and, t, are, product, species, and, and, are, the, stoichiometric, coefficients, of, the, respective, reactants, and, products, the, equilibrium, concentration, position, of, a, reaction, is, said, to, lie, far, to, the, right, if, at, equilibrium, nearly, all, the, reactants, are, consumed, conversely, the, equilibrium, position, is, said, to, be, far, to, the, left, if, hardly, any, product, is, formed, from, the, reactants, guldberg, and, waage, 1865, building, on, berthollet, s, ideas, proposed, the, law, of, mass, action, where, a, b, s, and, t, are, active, masses, and, k, and, k, are, rate, constants, since, at, equilibrium, forward, and, backward, rates, are, equal, and, the, ratio, of, the, rate, constants, is, also, a, constant, now, known, as, an, equilibrium, constant, by, convention, the, products, form, the, numerator, however, the, law, of, mass, action, is, valid, only, for, concerted, one, step, reactions, that, proceed, through, a, single, transition, state, and, is, not, valid, in, general, because, rate, equations, do, not, in, general, follow, the, stoichiometry, of, the, reaction, as, guldberg, and, waage, had, proposed, see, for, example, nucleophilic, aliphatic, substitution, by, s, n, 1, or, reaction, of, hydrogen, and, bromine, to, form, hydrogen, bromide, equality, of, forward, and, backward, reaction, rates, however, is, a, necessary, condition, for, chemical, equilibrium, though, it, is, not, sufficient, to, explain, why, equilibrium, occurs, despite, the, limitations, of, this, derivation, the, equilibrium, constant, for, a, reaction, is, indeed, a, constant, independent, of, the, activities, of, the, various, species, involved, though, it, does, depend, on, temperature, as, observed, by, the, van, t, hoff, equation, adding, a, catalyst, will, affect, both, the, forward, reaction, and, the, reverse, reaction, in, the, same, way, and, will, not, have, an, effect, on, the, equilibrium, constant, the, catalyst, will, speed, up, both, reactions, thereby, increasing, the, speed, at, which, equilibrium, is, reached, although, the, macroscopic, equilibrium, concentrations, are, constant, in, time, reactions, do, occur, at, the, molecular, level, for, example, in, the, case, of, acetic, acid, dissolved, in, water, and, forming, acetate, and, hydronium, ions, a, proton, may, hop, from, one, molecule, of, acetic, acid, onto, a, water, molecule, and, then, onto, an, acetate, anion, to, form, another, molecule, of, acetic, acid, and, leaving, the, number, of, acetic, acid, molecules, unchanged, this, is, an, example, of, dynamic, equilibrium, equilibria, like, the, rest, of, thermodynamics, are, statistical, phenomena, averages, of, microscopic, behavior, le, ch, telier, s, principle, 1884, predicts, the, behavior, of, an, equilibrium, system, when, changes, to, its, reaction, conditions, occur, if, a, dynamic, equilibrium, is, disturbed, by, changing, the, conditions, the, position, of, equilibrium, moves, to, partially, reverse, the, change, for, example, adding, more, s, to, the, chemical, reaction, above, from, the, outside, will, cause, an, excess, of, products, and, the, system, will, try, to, counteract, this, by, increasing, the, reverse, reaction, and, pushing, the, equilibrium, point, backward, though, the, equilibrium, constant, will, stay, the, same, if, mineral, acid, is, added, to, the, acetic, acid, mixture, increasing, the, concentration, of, hydronium, ion, the, amount, of, dissociation, must, decrease, as, the, reaction, is, driven, to, the, left, in, accordance, with, this, principle, this, can, also, be, deduced, from, the, equilibrium, constant, expression, for, the, reaction, if, h, 3, o, increases, ch, 3, co, 2, h, must, increase, and, ch, 3, co, 2, must, decrease, the, h, 2, o, is, left, out, as, it, is, the, solvent, and, its, concentration, remains, high, and, nearly, constant, a, quantitative, version, is, given, by, the, reaction, quotient, j, w, gibbs, suggested, in, 1873, that, equilibrium, is, attained, when, the, gibbs, free, energy, of, the, system, is, at, its, minimum, value, assuming, the, reaction, is, carried, out, at, a, constant, temperature, and, pressure, what, this, means, is, that, the, derivative, of, the, gibbs, energy, with, respect, to, reaction, coordinate, a, measure, of, the, extent, of, reaction, that, has, occurred, ranging, from, zero, for, all, reactants, to, a, maximum, for, all, products, vanishes, because, dg, 0, signaling, a, stationary, point, this, derivative, is, called, the, reaction, gibbs, energy, or, energy, change, and, corresponds, to, the, difference, between, the, chemical, potentials, of, reactants, and, products, at, the, composition, of, the, reaction, mixture, this, criterion, is, both, necessary, and, sufficient, if, a, mixture, is, not, at, equilibrium, the, liberation, of, the, excess, gibbs, energy, or, helmholtz, energy, at, constant, volume, reactions, is, the, driving, force, for, the, composition, of, the, mixture, to, change, until, equilibrium, is, reached, the, equilibrium, constant, can, be, related, to, the, standard, gibbs, free, energy, change, for, the, reaction, by, the, equation, where, r, is, the, universal, gas, constant, and, t, the, temperature, when, the, reactants, are, dissolved, in, a, medium, of, high, ionic, strength, the, quotient, of, activity, coefficients, may, be, taken, to, be, constant, in, that, case, the, concentration, quotient, k, c, where, is, the, concentration, of, a, etc, is, independent, of, the, analytical, concentration, of, the, reactants, for, this, reason, equilibrium, constants, for, solutions, are, usually, determined, in, media, of, high, ionic, strength, k, c, varies, with, ionic, strength, temperature, and, pressure, or, volume, likewise, k, p, for, gases, depends, on, partial, pressure, these, constants, are, easier, to, measure, and, encountered, in, high, school, chemistry, courses, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, one, must, consider, the, gibbs, free, energy, g, while, at, constant, temperature, and, volume, one, must, consider, the, helmholtz, free, energy, a, for, the, reaction, and, at, constant, internal, energy, and, volume, one, must, consider, the, entropy, s, for, the, reaction, the, constant, volume, case, is, important, in, geochemistry, and, atmospheric, chemistry, where, pressure, variations, are, significant, note, that, if, reactants, and, products, were, in, standard, state, completely, pure, then, there, would, be, no, reversibility, and, no, equilibrium, indeed, they, would, necessarily, occupy, disjoint, volumes, of, space, the, mixing, of, the, products, and, reactants, contributes, a, large, entropy, increase, known, as, entropy, of, mixing, to, states, containing, equal, mixture, of, products, and, reactants, and, gives, rise, to, a, distinctive, minimum, in, the, gibbs, energy, as, a, function, of, the, extent, of, reaction, the, standard, gibbs, energy, change, together, with, the, gibbs, energy, of, mixing, determine, the, equilibrium, state, in, this, article, only, the, constant, pressure, case, is, considered, the, relation, between, the, gibbs, free, energy, and, the, equilibrium, constant, can, be, found, by, considering, chemical, potentials, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, in, the, absence, of, an, applied, voltage, the, gibbs, free, energy, g, for, the, reaction, depends, only, on, the, extent, of, reaction, greek, letter, xi, and, can, only, decrease, according, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, it, means, that, the, derivative, of, g, with, respect, to, must, be, negative, if, the, reaction, happens, at, the, equilibrium, this, derivative, is, equal, to, zero, in, order, to, meet, the, thermodynamic, condition, for, equilibrium, the, gibbs, energy, must, be, stationary, meaning, that, the, derivative, of, g, with, respect, to, the, extent, of, reaction, must, be, zero, it, can, be, shown, that, in, this, case, the, sum, of, chemical, potentials, times, the, stoichiometric, coefficients, of, the, products, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, those, corresponding, to, the, reactants, therefore, the, sum, of, the, gibbs, energies, of, the, reactants, must, be, the, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, gibbs, energies, of, the, products, where, is, in, this, case, a, partial, molar, gibbs, energy, a, chemical, potential, the, chemical, potential, of, a, reagent, a, is, a, function, of, the, activity, a, of, that, reagent, where, o, a, is, the, standard, chemical, potential, the, definition, of, the, gibbs, energy, equation, interacts, with, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, to, produce, inserting, dn, i, i, d, into, the, above, equation, gives, a, stoichiometric, coefficient, i, displaystyle, nu, i, and, a, differential, that, denotes, the, reaction, occurring, to, an, infinitesimal, extent, d, at, constant, pressure, and, temperature, the, above, equations, can, be, written, as, which, is, the, gibbs, free, energy, change, for, the, reaction, this, results, in, by, substituting, the, chemical, potentials, the, relationship, becomes, which, is, the, standard, gibbs, energy, change, for, the, reaction, that, can, be, calculated, using, thermodynamical, tables, the, reaction, quotient, is, defined, as, therefore, at, equilibrium, leading, to, and, obtaining, the, value, of, the, standard, gibbs, energy, change, allows, the, calculation, of, the, equilibrium, constant, for, a, reactional, system, at, equilibrium, q, r, k, eq, eq, note, that, activities, and, equilibrium, constants, are, dimensionless, numbers, the, expression, for, the, equilibrium, constant, can, be, rewritten, as, the, product, of, a, concentration, quotient, k, c, and, an, activity, coefficient, quotient, is, the, concentration, of, reagent, a, etc, it, is, possible, in, principle, to, obtain, values, of, the, activity, coefficients, for, solutions, equations, such, as, the, debye, h, ckel, equation, or, extensions, such, as, davies, equation, specific, ion, interaction, theory, or, pitzer, equations, may, be, used, software, below, however, this, is, not, always, possible, it, is, common, practice, to, assume, that, is, a, constant, and, to, use, the, concentration, quotient, in, place, of, the, thermodynamic, equilibrium, constant, it, is, also, general, practice, to, use, the, term, equilibrium, constant, instead, of, the, more, accurate, concentration, quotient, this, practice, will, be, followed, here, for, reactions, in, the, gas, phase, partial, pressure, is, used, in, place, of, concentration, and, fugacity, coefficient, in, place, of, activity, coefficient, in, the, real, world, for, example, when, making, ammonia, in, industry, fugacity, coefficients, must, be, taken, into, account, fugacity, f, is, the, product, of, partial, pressure, and, fugacity, coefficient, the, chemical, potential, of, a, species, in, the, real, gas, phase, is, given, by, so, the, general, expression, defining, an, equilibrium, constant, is, valid, for, both, solution, and, gas, phases, in, aqueous, solution, equilibrium, constants, are, usually, determined, in, the, presence, of, an, inert, electrolyte, such, as, sodium, nitrate, nano, 3, or, potassium, perchlorate, kclo, 4, the, ionic, strength, of, a, solution, is, given, by, where, c, i, and, z, i, stand, for, the, concentration, and, ionic, charge, of, ion, type, i, and, the, sum, is, taken, over, all, the, n, types, of, charged, species, in, solution, when, the, concentration, of, dissolved, salt, is, much, higher, than, the, analytical, concentrations, of, the, reagents, the, ions, originating, from, the, dissolved, salt, determine, the, ionic, strength, and, the, ionic, strength, is, effectively, constant, since, activity, coefficients, depend, on, ionic, strength, the, activity, coefficients, of, the, species, are, effectively, independent, of, concentration, thus, the, assumption, that, is, constant, is, justified, the, concentration, quotient, is, a, simple, multiple, of, the, equilibrium, constant, however, k, c, will, vary, with, ionic, strength, if, it, is, measured, at, a, series, of, different, ionic, strengths, the, value, can, be, extrapolated, to, zero, ionic, strength, the, concentration, quotient, obtained, in, this, manner, is, known, paradoxically, as, a, thermodynamic, equilibrium, constant, before, using, a, published, value, of, an, equilibrium, constant, in, conditions, of, ionic, strength, different, from, the, conditions, used, in, its, determination, the, value, should, be, adjusted, software, below, a, mixture, may, appear, to, have, no, tendency, to, change, though, it, is, not, at, equilibrium, for, example, a, mixture, of, so, 2, and, o, 2, is, metastable, as, there, is, a, kinetic, barrier, to, formation, of, the, product, so, 3, the, barrier, can, be, overcome, when, a, catalyst, is, also, present, in, the, mixture, as, in, the, contact, process, but, the, catalyst, does, not, affect, the, equilibrium, concentrations, likewise, the, formation, of, bicarbonate, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, is, very, slow, under, normal, conditions, but, almost, instantaneous, in, the, presence, of, the, catalytic, enzyme, carbonic, anhydrase, when, pure, substances, liquids, or, solids, are, involved, in, equilibria, their, activities, do, not, appear, in, the, equilibrium, constant, because, their, numerical, values, are, considered, one, applying, the, general, formula, for, an, equilibrium, constant, to, the, specific, case, of, a, dilute, solution, of, acetic, acid, in, water, one, obtains, for, all, but, very, concentrated, solutions, the, water, can, be, considered, a, pure, liquid, and, therefore, it, has, an, activity, of, one, the, equilibrium, constant, expression, is, therefore, usually, written, as, a, particular, case, is, the, self, ionization, of, water, because, water, is, the, solvent, and, has, an, activity, of, one, the, self, ionization, constant, of, water, is, defined, as, it, is, perfectly, legitimate, to, write, for, the, hydronium, ion, concentration, since, the, state, of, solvation, of, the, proton, is, constant, in, dilute, solutions, and, so, does, not, affect, the, equilibrium, concentrations, k, w, varies, with, variation, in, ionic, strength, and, or, temperature, the, concentrations, of, h, and, oh, are, not, independent, quantities, most, commonly, is, replaced, by, k, w, 1, in, equilibrium, constant, expressions, which, would, otherwise, include, hydroxide, ion, solids, also, do, not, appear, in, the, equilibrium, constant, expression, if, they, are, considered, to, be, pure, and, thus, their, activities, taken, to, be, one, an, example, is, the, boudouard, reaction, for, which, the, equation, without, solid, carbon, is, written, as, consider, the, case, of, a, dibasic, acid, h, 2, a, when, dissolved, in, water, the, mixture, will, contain, h, 2, a, ha, and, a, 2, this, equilibrium, can, be, split, into, two, steps, in, each, of, which, one, proton, is, liberated, k, 1, and, k, 2, are, examples, of, stepwise, equilibrium, constants, the, overall, equilibrium, constant, d, is, product, of, the, stepwise, constants, note, that, these, constants, are, dissociation, constants, because, the, products, on, the, right, hand, side, of, the, equilibrium, expression, are, dissociation, products, in, many, systems, it, is, preferable, to, use, association, constants, 1, and, 2, are, examples, of, association, constants, clearly, 1, 1, k, 2, and, 2, 1, d, log, 1, p, k, 2, and, log, 2, p, k, 2, p, k, 1, for, multiple, equilibrium, systems, also, see, theory, of, response, reactions, the, effect, of, changing, temperature, on, an, equilibrium, constant, is, given, by, the, van, t, hoff, equation, thus, for, exothermic, reactions, h, is, negative, k, decreases, with, an, increase, in, temperature, but, for, endothermic, reactions, h, is, positive, k, increases, with, an, increase, temperature, an, alternative, formulation, is, at, first, sight, this, appears, to, offer, a, means, of, obtaining, the, standard, molar, enthalpy, of, the, reaction, by, studying, the, variation, of, k, with, temperature, in, practice, however, the, method, is, unreliable, because, error, propagation, almost, always, gives, very, large, errors, on, the, values, calculated, in, this, way, the, effect, of, electric, field, on, equilibrium, has, been, studied, by, manfred, eigen, among, others, equilibrium, can, be, broadly, classified, as, heterogeneous, and, homogeneous, equilibrium, homogeneous, equilibrium, consists, of, reactants, and, products, belonging, in, the, same, phase, whereas, heterogeneous, equilibrium, comes, into, play, for, reactants, and, products, in, different, phases, in, these, applications, terms, such, as, stability, constant, formation, constant, binding, constant, affinity, constant, association, constant, and, dissociation, constant, are, used, in, biochemistry, it, is, common, to, give, units, for, binding, constants, which, serve, to, define, the, concentration, units, used, when, the, constant, s, value, was, determined, when, the, only, equilibrium, is, that, of, the, formation, of, a, 1, 1, adduct, as, the, composition, of, a, mixture, there, are, many, ways, that, the, composition, of, a, mixture, can, be, calculated, for, example, see, ice, table, for, a, traditional, method, of, calculating, the, ph, of, a, solution, of, a, weak, acid, there, are, three, approaches, to, the, general, calculation, of, the, composition, of, a, mixture, at, equilibrium, in, general, the, calculations, are, rather, complicated, or, complex, for, instance, in, the, case, of, a, dibasic, acid, h, 2, a, dissolved, in, water, the, two, reactants, can, be, specified, as, the, conjugate, base, a, 2, and, the, proton, h, the, following, equations, of, mass, balance, could, apply, equally, well, to, a, base, such, as, 1, 2, diaminoethane, in, which, case, the, base, itself, is, designated, as, the, reactant, a, with, t, a, the, total, concentration, of, species, a, note, that, it, is, customary, to, omit, the, ionic, charges, when, writing, and, using, these, equations, when, the, equilibrium, constants, are, known, and, the, total, concentrations, are, specified, there, are, two, equations, in, two, unknown, free, concentrations, and, this, follows, from, the, fact, that, 1, 2, 2, and, k, w, 1, so, the, concentrations, of, the, complexes, are, calculated, from, the, free, concentrations, and, the, equilibrium, constants, general, expressions, applicable, to, all, systems, with, two, reagents, a, and, b, would, be, it, is, easy, to, see, how, this, can, be, extended, to, three, or, more, reagents, the, composition, of, solutions, containing, reactants, a, and, h, is, easy, to, calculate, as, a, function, of, p, when, is, known, the, free, concentration, is, calculated, from, the, mass, balance, equation, in, a, the, diagram, alongside, shows, an, example, of, the, hydrolysis, of, the, aluminium, lewis, acid, al, 3, aq, shows, the, species, concentrations, for, a, 5, 10, 6, m, solution, of, an, aluminium, salt, as, a, function, of, ph, each, concentration, is, shown, as, a, percentage, of, the, total, aluminium, the, diagram, above, illustrates, the, point, that, a, precipitate, that, is, not, one, of, the, main, species, in, the, solution, equilibrium, may, be, formed, at, ph, just, below, 5, 5, the, main, species, present, in, a, 5, m, solution, of, al, 3, are, aluminium, hydroxides, al, oh, 2, aloh, 2, and, al, 13, oh, 7, 32, but, on, raising, the, ph, al, oh, 3, precipitates, from, the, solution, this, occurs, because, al, oh, 3, has, a, very, large, lattice, energy, as, the, ph, rises, more, and, more, al, oh, 3, comes, out, of, solution, this, is, an, example, of, le, ch, telier, s, principle, in, action, increasing, the, concentration, of, the, hydroxide, ion, causes, more, aluminium, hydroxide, to, precipitate, which, removes, hydroxide, from, the, solution, when, the, hydroxide, concentration, becomes, sufficiently, high, the, soluble, aluminate, al, oh, 4, is, formed, another, common, instance, where, precipitation, occurs, is, when, a, metal, cation, interacts, with, an, anionic, ligand, to, form, an, electrically, neutral, complex, if, the, complex, is, hydrophobic, it, will, precipitate, out, of, water, this, occurs, with, the, nickel, ion, ni, 2, and, dimethylglyoxime, dmgh, 2, in, this, case, the, lattice, energy, of, the, solid, is, not, particularly, large, but, it, greatly, exceeds, the, energy, of, solvation, of, the, molecule, ni, dmgh, 2, at, equilibrium, at, a, specified, temperature, and, pressure, and, with, no, external, forces, the, gibbs, free, energy, g, is, at, a, minimum, where, j, is, the, chemical, potential, of, molecular, species, j, and, n, j, is, the, amount, of, molecular, species, j, it, may, be, expressed, in, terms, of, thermodynamic, activity, as, where, j, displaystyle, mu, j, ominus, is, the, chemical, potential, in, the, standard, state, r, is, the, gas, constant, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, a, j, is, the, activity, for, a, closed, system, no, particles, may, enter, or, leave, although, they, may, combine, in, various, ways, the, total, number, of, atoms, of, each, element, will, remain, constant, this, means, that, the, minimization, above, must, be, subjected, to, the, constraints, where, a, ij, is, the, number, of, atoms, of, element, i, in, molecule, j, and, b, 0, i, is, the, total, number, of, atoms, of, element, i, which, is, a, constant, since, the, system, is, closed, if, there, are, a, total, of, k, types, of, atoms, in, the, system, then, there, will, be, k, such, equations, if, ions, are, involved, an, additional, row, is, added, to, the, a, ij, matrix, specifying, the, respective, charge, on, each, molecule, which, will, sum, to, zero, this, is, a, standard, problem, in, optimisation, known, as, constrained, minimisation, the, most, common, method, of, solving, it, is, using, the, method, of, lagrange, multipliers, although, other, methods, may, be, used, define, where, the, i, are, the, lagrange, multipliers, one, for, each, element, this, allows, each, of, the, n, j, and, j, to, be, treated, independently, and, it, can, be, shown, using, the, tools, of, multivariate, calculus, that, the, equilibrium, condition, is, given, by, for, proof, see, lagrange, multipliers, this, is, a, set, of, m, k, equations, in, m, k, unknowns, the, n, j, and, the, i, and, may, therefore, be, solved, for, the, equilibrium, concentrations, n, j, as, long, as, the, chemical, activities, are, known, as, functions, of, the, concentrations, at, the, given, temperature, and, pressure, in, the, ideal, case, activities, are, proportional, to, concentrations, see, thermodynamic, databases, for, pure, substances, note, that, the, second, equation, is, just, the, initial, constraints, for, minimization, this, method, of, calculating, equilibrium, chemical, concentrations, is, useful, for, systems, with, a, large, number, of, different, molecules, the, use, of, k, atomic, element, conservation, equations, for, the, mass, constraint, is, straightforward, and, replaces, the, use, of, the, stoichiometric, coefficient, equations, the, results, are, consistent, with, those, specified, by, chemical, equations, for, example, if, equilibrium, is, specified, by, a, single, chemical, equation, where, j, is, the, stoichiometric, coefficient, for, the, j, th, molecule, negative, for, reactants, positive, for, products, and, r, j, is, the, symbol, for, the, j, th, molecule, a, properly, balanced, equation, will, obey, multiplying, the, first, equilibrium, condition, by, j, and, using, the, above, equation, yields, as, above, defining, g, where, k, c, is, the, equilibrium, constant, and, g, will, be, zero, at, equilibrium, analogous, procedures, exist, for, the, minimization, of, other, thermodynamic, potentials
