in, organosilicon, and, polymer, chemistry, a, silicone, or, polysiloxane, is, a, polymer, composed, of, repeating, units, of, siloxane, o, r, 2, si, o, sir, 2, where, r, organic, group, they, are, typically, colorless, oils, or, rubber, like, substances, silicones, are, used, in, sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking, utensils, thermal, insulation, and, electrical, insulation, some, common, forms, include, silicone, oil, grease, rubber, resin, and, caulk, alfred, stock, and, carl, somiesky, examined, the, hydrolysis, of, dichlorosilane, a, reaction, that, was, proposed, to, initially, give, the, monomer, h, 2, sio, sih, 2, cl, 2, h, 2, o, h, 2, sio, 2, hcl, displaystyle, ce, sih2cl2, h2o, h2sio, 2, hcl, when, the, hydrolysis, is, performed, by, treating, a, solution, of, h, 2, sicl, 2, in, benzene, with, water, the, product, was, determined, to, have, the, approximate, formula, 6, higher, polymers, were, proposed, to, form, with, time, most, polysiloxanes, feature, organic, substituents, e, g, n, and, n, all, polymerized, siloxanes, or, polysiloxanes, silicones, consist, of, an, inorganic, silicon, oxygen, backbone, chain, si, o, si, o, si, o, with, two, groups, attached, to, each, silicon, center, the, materials, can, be, cyclic, or, polymeric, by, varying, the, si, o, chain, lengths, side, groups, and, crosslinking, silicones, can, be, synthesized, with, a, wide, variety, of, properties, and, compositions, they, can, vary, in, consistency, from, liquid, to, gel, to, rubber, to, hard, plastic, the, most, common, siloxane, is, linear, polydimethylsiloxane, pdms, a, silicone, oil, the, second, largest, group, of, silicone, materials, is, based, on, silicone, resins, which, are, formed, by, branched, and, cage, like, oligosiloxanes, f, s, kipping, coined, the, word, silicone, in, 1901, to, describe, the, formula, of, polydiphenylsiloxane, ph, 2, sio, ph, phenyl, c, 6, h, 5, by, analogy, with, the, formula, of, the, ketone, benzophenone, ph, 2, co, his, term, was, originally, silicoketone, kipping, was, well, aware, that, polydiphenylsiloxane, is, polymeric, whereas, benzophenone, is, monomeric, and, noted, the, contrasting, properties, of, ph, 2, sio, and, ph, 2, co, the, discovery, of, the, structural, differences, between, kipping, s, molecules, and, the, ketones, means, that, silicone, is, no, longer, the, correct, term, though, it, remains, in, common, usage, and, that, the, term, siloxane, is, preferred, according, to, the, nomenclature, of, modern, chemistry, james, franklin, hyde, born, 11, march, 1903, was, an, american, chemist, and, inventor, he, has, been, called, the, father, of, silicones, and, is, credited, with, the, launch, of, the, silicone, industry, in, the, 1930s, his, most, notable, contributions, include, his, creation, of, silicone, from, silicon, compounds, and, his, method, of, making, fused, silica, a, high, quality, glass, later, used, in, aeronautics, advanced, telecommunications, and, computer, chips, his, work, led, to, the, formation, of, dow, corning, an, alliance, between, the, dow, chemical, company, and, corning, glass, works, that, was, specifically, created, to, produce, silicone, products, silicone, is, often, confused, with, silicon, but, they, are, distinct, substances, silicon, is, a, chemical, element, a, hard, dark, grey, semiconducting, metalloid, which, in, its, crystalline, form, is, used, to, make, integrated, circuits, electronic, chips, and, solar, cells, silicones, are, compounds, that, contain, silicon, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and, perhaps, other, kinds, of, atoms, as, well, and, have, many, very, different, physical, and, chemical, properties, compounds, containing, silicon, oxygen, double, bonds, now, called, silanones, but, which, could, deserve, the, name, silicone, have, long, been, identified, as, intermediates, in, gas, phase, processes, such, as, chemical, vapor, deposition, in, microelectronics, production, and, in, the, formation, of, ceramics, by, combustion, however, they, have, a, strong, tendency, to, polymerize, into, siloxanes, the, first, stable, silanone, was, obtained, in, 2014, by, a, filippou, and, others, most, common, are, materials, based, on, polydimethylsiloxane, which, is, derived, by, hydrolysis, of, dimethyldichlorosilane, this, dichloride, reacts, with, water, as, follows, n, si, ch, 3, 2, cl, 2, n, h, 2, o, si, ch, 3, 2, o, n, 2, n, hcl, displaystyle, n, ce, si, ch3, 2cl2, n, ce, h2o, n, 2n, ce, hcl, the, polymerization, typically, produces, linear, chains, capped, with, si, cl, or, si, oh, silanol, groups, under, different, conditions, the, polymer, is, a, cyclic, not, a, chain, for, consumer, applications, such, as, caulks, silyl, acetates, are, used, instead, of, silyl, chlorides, the, hydrolysis, of, the, acetates, produces, the, less, dangerous, acetic, acid, the, acid, found, in, vinegar, as, the, reaction, product, of, a, much, slower, curing, process, this, chemistry, is, used, in, many, consumer, applications, such, as, silicone, caulk, and, adhesives, n, si, ch, 3, 2, ch, 3, coo, 2, n, h, 2, o, si, ch, 3, 2, o, n, 2, n, ch, 3, cooh, displaystyle, n, ce, si, ch3, 2, ch3coo, 2, n, ce, h2o, n, 2n, ce, ch3cooh, branches, or, crosslinks, in, the, polymer, chain, can, be, introduced, by, using, organosilicone, precursors, with, fewer, alkyl, groups, such, as, methyl, trichlorosilane, and, methyltrimethoxysilane, ideally, each, molecule, of, such, a, compound, becomes, a, branch, point, this, process, can, be, used, to, produce, hard, silicone, resins, similarly, precursors, with, three, methyl, groups, can, be, used, to, limit, molecular, weight, since, each, such, molecule, has, only, one, reactive, site, and, so, forms, the, end, of, a, siloxane, chain, when, silicone, is, burned, in, air, or, oxygen, it, forms, solid, silica, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, as, a, white, powder, char, and, various, gases, the, readily, dispersed, powder, is, sometimes, called, silica, fume, the, pyrolysis, of, certain, polysiloxanes, under, an, inert, atmosphere, is, a, valuable, pathway, towards, the, production, of, amorphous, silicon, oxycarbide, ceramics, also, known, as, polymer, derived, ceramics, polysiloxanes, terminated, with, functional, ligands, such, as, vinyl, mercapto, or, acrylate, groups, have, been, cross, linked, to, yield, preceramic, polymers, which, can, be, photopolymerised, for, the, additive, manufacturing, of, polymer, derived, ceramics, by, stereolithography, techniques, silicones, exhibit, many, useful, characteristics, including, silicone, can, be, developed, into, rubber, sheeting, where, it, has, other, properties, such, as, being, fda, compliant, this, extends, the, uses, of, silicone, sheeting, to, industries,
