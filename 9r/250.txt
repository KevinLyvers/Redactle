a, cepheid, variable, s, f, i, d, s, i, f, i, is, a, type, of, variable, star, that, pulsates, radially, varying, in, both, diameter, and, temperature, it, changes, in, brightness, with, a, well, defined, stable, period, and, amplitude, cepheids, are, important, cosmic, benchmarks, for, scaling, galactic, and, extragalactic, distances, a, strong, direct, relationship, exists, between, a, cepheid, variable, s, luminosity, and, its, pulsation, period, cepheids, change, brightness, due, to, the, mechanism, which, occurs, when, opacity, in, a, star, increases, with, temperature, rather, than, decreasing, the, main, gas, involved, is, thought, to, be, helium, first, the, outer, layer, of, the, star, contracts, heating, due, to, compression, until, the, helium, doubly, ionizes, becoming, much, more, opaque, this, causes, it, to, accumulate, heat, causing, a, build, up, of, pressure, that, forces, the, layer, back, out, again, until, it, cools, enough, to, become, singly, ionized, again, the, helium, now, transparent, and, not, accumulating, as, much, heat, and, pressure, contracts, again, to, restart, the, cycle, cepheid, variables, become, dimmest, during, the, part, of, the, cycle, when, the, helium, is, doubly, ionized, this, characteristic, of, classical, cepheids, was, discovered, in, 1908, by, henrietta, swan, leavitt, after, studying, thousands, of, variable, stars, in, the, magellanic, clouds, the, discovery, establishes, the, true, luminosity, of, a, cepheid, by, observing, its, pulsation, period, this, in, turn, gives, the, distance, to, the, star, by, comparing, its, known, luminosity, to, its, observed, brightness, calibrated, by, directly, observing, the, parallax, distance, to, the, closest, cepheids, such, as, rs, puppis, and, polaris, the, term, cepheid, originates, from, delta, cephei, in, the, constellation, cepheus, identified, by, john, goodricke, in, 1784, it, was, the, first, of, its, type, to, be, identified, on, september, 10, 1784, edward, pigott, detected, the, variability, of, eta, aquilae, the, first, known, representative, of, the, class, of, classical, cepheid, variables, the, eponymous, star, for, classical, cepheids, delta, cephei, was, discovered, to, be, variable, by, john, goodricke, a, few, months, later, the, number, of, similar, variables, grew, to, several, dozen, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, they, were, referred, to, as, a, class, as, cepheids, most, of, the, cepheids, were, known, from, the, distinctive, light, curve, shapes, with, the, rapid, increase, in, brightness, and, a, hump, but, some, with, more, symmetrical, light, curves, were, known, as, geminids, after, the, prototype, geminorum, a, relationship, between, the, period, and, luminosity, for, classical, cepheids, was, discovered, in, 1908, by, henrietta, swan, leavitt, in, an, investigation, of, thousands, of, variable, stars, in, the, magellanic, clouds, she, published, it, in, 1912, with, further, evidence, cepheid, variables, were, found, to, show, radial, velocity, variation, with, the, same, period, as, the, luminosity, variation, and, initially, this, was, interpreted, as, evidence, that, these, stars, were, part, of, a, binary, system, however, in, 1914, harlow, shapley, demonstrated, that, this, idea, should, be, abandoned, two, years, later, shapley, and, others, had, discovered, that, cepheid, variables, changed, their, spectral, types, over, the, course, of, a, cycle, in, 1913, ejnar, hertzsprung, attempted, to, find, distances, to, 13, cepheids, using, their, motion, through, the, sky, his, results, would, later, require, revision, in, 1918, harlow, shapley, used, cepheids, to, place, initial, constraints, on, the, size, and, shape, of, the, milky, way, and, of, the, placement, of, the, sun, within, it, in, 1924, edwin, hubble, established, the, distance, to, classical, cepheid, variables, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, until, then, known, as, the, andromeda, nebula, and, showed, that, those, variables, were, not, members, of, the, milky, way, hubble, s, finding, settled, the, question, raised, in, the, great, debate, of, whether, the, milky, way, represented, the, entire, universe, or, was, merely, one, of, many, galaxies, in, the, universe, in, 1929, hubble, and, milton, l, humason, formulated, what, is, now, known, as, hubble, s, law, by, combining, cepheid, distances, to, several, galaxies, with, vesto, slipher, s, measurements, of, the, speed, at, which, those, galaxies, recede, from, us, they, discovered, that, the, universe, is, expanding, confirming, the, theories, of, georges, lema, tre, in, the, mid, 20th, century, significant, problems, with, the, astronomical, distance, scale, were, resolved, by, dividing, the, cepheids, into, different, classes, with, very, different, properties, in, the, 1940s, walter, baade, recognized, two, separate, populations, of, cepheids, classical, and, type, ii, classical, cepheids, are, younger, and, more, massive, population, i, stars, whereas, type, ii, cepheids, are, older, fainter, population, ii, stars, classical, cepheids, and, type, ii, cepheids, follow, different, period, luminosity, relationships, the, luminosity, of, type, ii, cepheids, is, on, average, less, than, classical, cepheids, by, about, 1, 5, magnitudes, but, still, brighter, than, rr, lyrae, stars, baade, s, seminal, discovery, led, to, a, twofold, increase, in, the, distance, to, m31, and, the, extragalactic, distance, scale, rr, lyrae, stars, then, known, as, cluster, variables, were, recognized, fairly, early, as, being, a, separate, class, of, variable, due, in, part, to, their, short, periods, the, mechanics, of, stellar, pulsation, as, a, heat, engine, was, proposed, in, 1917, by, arthur, stanley, eddington, who, wrote, at, length, on, the, dynamics, of, cepheids, but, it, was, not, until, 1953, that, s, a, zhevakin, identified, ionized, helium, as, a, likely, valve, for, the, engine, cepheid, variables, are, divided, into, two, subclasses, which, exhibit, markedly, different, masses, ages, and, evolutionary, histories, classical, cepheids, and, type, ii, cepheids, delta, scuti, variables, are, a, type, stars, on, or, near, the, main, sequence, at, the, lower, end, of, the, instability, strip, and, were, originally, referred, to, as, dwarf, cepheids, rr, lyrae, variables, have, short, periods, and, lie, on, the, instability, strip, where, it, crosses, the, horizontal, branch, delta, scuti, variables, and, rr, lyrae, variables, are, not, generally, treated, with, cepheid, variables, although, their, pulsations, originate, with, the, same, helium, ionisation, kappa, mechanism, classical, cepheids, also, known, as, population, i, cepheids, type, i, cepheids, or, delta, cepheid, variables, undergo, pulsations, with, very, regular, periods, on, the, order, of, days, to, months, classical, cepheids, are, population, i, variable, stars, which, are, 4, 20, times, more, massive, than, the, sun, and, up, to, 100, 000, times, more, luminous, these, cepheids, are, yellow, bright, giants, and, supergiants, of, spectral, class, f6, k2, and, their, radii, change, by, 25, for, the, longer, period, i, carinae, millions, of, kilometers, during, a, pulsation, cycle, classical, cepheids, are, used, to, determine, distances, to, galaxies, within, the, local, group, and, beyond, and, are, a, means, by, which, the, hubble, constant, can, be, established, classical, cepheids, have, also, been, used, to, clarify, many, characteristics, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, such, as, the, sun, s, height, above, the, galactic, plane, and, the, galaxy, s, local, spiral, structure, a, group, of, classical, cepheids, with, small, amplitudes, and, sinusoidal, light, curves, are, often, separated, out, as, small, amplitude, cepheids, or, s, cepheids, many, of, them, pulsating, in, the, first, overtone, type, ii, cepheids, also, termed, population, ii, cepheids, are, population, ii, variable, stars, which, pulsate, with, periods, typically, between, 1, and, 50, days, type, ii, cepheids, are, typically, metal, poor, old, 10, gyr, low, mass, objects, half, the, mass, of, the, sun, type, ii, cepheids, are, divided, into, several, subgroups, by, period, stars, with, periods, between, 1, and, 4, days, are, of, the, bl, her, subclass, 10, 20, days, belong, to, the, w, virginis, subclass, and, stars, with, periods, greater, than, 20, days, belong, to, the, rv, tauri, subclass, type, ii, cepheids, are, used, to, establish, the, distance, to, the, galactic, center, globular, clusters, and, galaxies, a, group, of, pulsating, stars, on, the, instability, strip, have, periods, of, less, than, 2, days, similar, to, rr, lyrae, variables, but, with, higher, luminosities, anomalous, cepheid, variables, have, masses, higher, than, type, ii, cepheids, rr, lyrae, variables, and, the, sun, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, young, stars, on, a, turned, back, horizontal, branch, blue, stragglers, formed, through, mass, transfer, in, binary, systems, or, a, mix, of, both, a, small, proportion, of, cepheid, variables, have, been, observed, to, pulsate, in, two, modes, at, the, same, time, usually, the, fundamental, and, first, overtone, occasionally, the, second, overtone, a, very, small, number, pulsate, in, three, modes, or, an, unusual, combination, of, modes, including, higher, overtones, chief, among, the, uncertainties, tied, to, the, classical, and, type, ii, cepheid, distance, scale, are, the, nature, of, the, period, luminosity, relation, in, various, passbands, the, impact, of, metallicity, on, both, the, zero, point, and, slope, of, those, relations, and, the, effects, of, photometric, contamination, blending, with, other, stars, and, a, changing, typically, unknown, extinction, law, on, cepheid, distances, all, these, topics, are, actively, debated, in, the, literature, these, unresolved, matters, have, resulted, in, cited, values, for, the, hubble, constant, established, from, classical, cepheids, ranging, between, 60, km, s, mpc, and, 80, km, s, mpc, resolving, this, discrepancy, is, one, of, the, foremost, problems, in, astronomy, since, the, cosmological, parameters, of, the, universe, may, be, constrained, by, supplying, a, precise, value, of, the, hubble, constant, uncertainties, have, diminished, over, the, years, due, in, part, to, discoveries, such, as, rs, puppis, delta, cephei, is, also, of, particular, importance, as, a, calibrator, of, the, cepheid, period, luminosity, relation, since, its, distance, is, among, the, most, precisely, established, for, a, cepheid, partly, because, it, is, a, member, of, a, star, cluster, and, the, availability, of, precise, parallaxes, observed, by, the, hubble, hipparcos, and, gaia, space, telescopes, the, accuracy, of, parallax, distance, measurements, to, cepheid, variables, and, other, bodies, within, 7, 500, light, years, is, vastly, improved, by, comparing, images, from, hubble, taken, six, months, apart, from, opposite, points, in, the, earth, s, orbit, between, two, such, observations, 2, au, apart, a, star, at, a, distance, of, 7500, light, years, 2300, parsecs, would, appear, to, move, an, angle, of, 2, 2300, arc, seconds, 2, x, 10, 7, degrees, the, resolution, limit, of, the, available, telescopes, the, accepted, explanation, for, the, pulsation, of, cepheids, is, called, the, eddington, valve, or, mechanism, where, the, greek, letter, kappa, is, the, usual, symbol, for, the, gas, opacity, helium, is, the, gas, thought, to, be, most, active, in, the, process, doubly, ionized, helium, helium, whose, atoms, are, missing, both, electrons, is, more, opaque, than, singly, ionized, helium, as, helium, is, heated, its, temperature, rises, until, it, reaches, the, point, at, which, double, ionisation, spontaneously, occurs, and, is, sustained, throughout, the, layer, in, much, the, same, way, a, fluorescent, tube, strikes, at, the, dimmest, part, of, a, cepheid, s, cycle, this, ionized, gas, in, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, is, relatively, opaque, and, so, is, heated, by, the, star, s, radiation, and, due, to, the, increasing, temperature, begins, to, expand, as, it, expands, it, cools, but, remains, ionised, until, another, threshold, is, reached, at, which, point, double, ionization, cannot, be, sustained, and, the, layer, becomes, singly, ionized, hence, more, transparent, which, allows, radiation, to, escape, the, expansion, then, stops, and, reverses, due, to, the, star, s, gravitational, attraction, the, star, s, states, are, held, to, be, either, expanding, or, contracting, by, the, hysterisis, generated, by, the, doubly, ionized, helium, and, indefinitely, flip, flops, between, the, two, states, reversing, every, time, the, upper, or, lower, threshold, is, crossed, this, process, is, rather, analogous, to, the, relaxation, oscillator, found, in, electronics, in, 1879, august, ritter, 1826, 1908, demonstrated, that, the, adiabatic, radial, pulsation, period, for, a, homogeneous, sphere, is, related, to, its, surface, gravity, and, radius, through, the, relation, t, k, r, g, displaystyle, t, k, sqrt, frac, r, g, where, k, is, a, proportionality, constant, now, since, the, surface, gravity, is, related, to, the, sphere, mass, and, radius, through, the, relation, g, k, m, r, 2, k, r, m, r, 3, k, r, displaystyle, g, k, frac, m, r, 2, k, frac, rm, r, 3, k, r, rho, one, finally, obtains, t, q, displaystyle, t, sqrt, rho, q, where, q, is, a, constant, called, the, pulsation, constant
