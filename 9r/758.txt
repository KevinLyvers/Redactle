local, names, for, seasons, which, have, little, equivalence, to, the, terms, originating, in, europe, according, to, the, online, etymological, dictionary, spring, in, the, sense, of, the, season, comes, from, phrases, such, as, springing, time, 14th, century, and, the, spring, of, the, year, this, use, is, from, an, archaic, noun, meaning, act, or, time, of, springing, or, appearing, the,

proto, germanic, sprenganan, meteorologists, generally, define, four, seasons, in, many, climatic, areas, spring, summer, autumn, fall, and, winter, these, are, determined, by, the, values, of, their, average, temperatures, on, a, monthly, basis, with, each, season, lasting, three, calendar, months, the, three, warmest, months, are, by, definition, summer, the, three, coldest, months, are, winter, and, the, intervening, gaps, are, spring, and, autumn, meteorological, spring, can, therefore, start, on, different, dates, in, different, regions, in, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, spring, months, are, march, april, and, may, in, ireland, following, the, irish, calendar, spring, is, often, defined, as, february, march, and, april, in, sweden, meteorologists, define, the, beginning, of, spring, as, the, first, occasion, on, which, the, average, 24, hours, temperature, exceeds, zero, degrees, celsius, for, seven, consecutive, days, thus, the, date, varies, with, latitude, and, elevation, but, no, earlier, than, 15, february, and, no, later, than, 31, july, in, australia, new, zealand, south, africa, and, brazil, the, spring, months, are, september, october, and, november, in, the, northern, hemisphere, with, countries, such, as, germany, the, united, states, canada, and, the, uk, solar, reckoning, was, traditionally, used, with, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, representing, the, midpoints, of, each, season, however, the, astronomical, vernal, equinox, varying, between, 19, and, 21, march, can, be, taken, to, mark, the, first, day, of, spring, with, the, summer, solstice, around, 21, june, marked, as, first, day, of, summer, by, solar, reckoning, spring, is, held, to, begin, 1, february, until, the, first, day, of, summer, on, may, day, with, the, summer, and, winter, solstices, being, marked, as, midsummer, and, midwinter, respectively, instead, of, as, the, beginning, of, the, season, as, is, the, case, with, astronomical, reckoning, in, persian, culture, the, first, day, of, spring, is, the, first, day, of, the, first, month, called, farvardin, which, begins, on, 20, or, 21, march, in, the, traditional, chinese,

of, spring, is, not, always, determined, by, fixed, calendar, dates, the, phenological, or, ecological, definition, of, spring, relates, to, biological, indicators, such, as, the, blossoming, of, a, range, of, plant, species, the, activities, of, animals, and, the, special, smell, of, soil, that, has, reached, the, temperature, for, micro, flora, to, flourish, these, indicators, along, with, the, beginning, of, spring, vary, according, to, the, local, climate, and, according, to, the, specific, weather, of, a, particular, year, in, england, wales, and, northern, ireland, the, national, trust, runs, the, blossomwatch, campaign, which, encourages, people, to, share, images, of, blossom, with, one, another, as, an, early, indicator, of, the, arrival, of, the, season, some, ecologists, divide, the, year, into, six, seasons, in, addition, to, spring, ecological, reckoning, identifies, an, earlier, separate, prevernal, early, or, pre, spring, season, between, the, hibernal, winter, and, vernal, spring, seasons, this, is, a, time, when, only, the, hardiest, flowers, like, the, crocus, are, in, bloom, sometimes, while, there, is, still, some, snowcover, on, the, ground, during, early, spring, the, axis, of, the, earth, is, increasing, its, tilt, relative, to, the, sun, and, the, length, of, daylight, rapidly, increases, for, the, relevant, hemisphere, the, hemisphere, begins, to, warm, significantly, causing, new, plant, growth, to, spring, forth, giving, the, season, its, name, any, snow, begins, to, melt, swelling, streams, with, runoff, and, any, frosts, become, less, severe, in, climates, that, have, no, snow, and, rare, frosts, air, and, ground, temperatures, increase, more, rapidly, many, flowering, plants, bloom, at, this, time, of, year, in, a, long, succession, sometimes, beginning, when, snow, is, still, on, the, ground, and, continuing, into, early, summer, in, normally, snowless, areas, spring, may, begin, as, early, as, february, northern, hemisphere, or, august, southern, hemisphere, heralded, by, the, blooming, of, deciduous, magnolias, cherries, and, quince, many, temperate, areas, have, a, dry, spring, and, wet, autumn, fall, which, brings, about, flowering, in, this, season, more, consistent, with, the, need, for, water, as, well, as, warmth, subarctic, areas, may, not, experience, spring, at, all, until, may, while, spring, is, a, result, of, the, warmth, caused, by, the, changing, orientation, of, the, earth, s, axis, relative, to, the, sun, the, weather, in, many, parts, of, the, world, is, affected, by, other, less, predictable, events, the, rainfall, in, spring, or, any, season, follows, trends, more, related, to, longer, cycles, such, as, the, solar, cycle, or, events, created, by, ocean, currents, and, ocean, temperatures, for, example, the, el, ni, o, effect, and, the, southern, oscillation, index, unstable, spring, weather, may, occur, more, often, when, warm, air, begins, to, invade, from, lower, latitudes, while, cold, air, is, still, pushing, from, the, polar, regions, flooding, is, also, most, common, in, and, near, mountainous, areas, during, this, time, of, year, because, of, snow, melt, which, is, accelerated, by, warm, rains, in, north, america, tornado, alley, is, most, active, at, this, time, of, year, especially, since, the, rocky, mountains, prevent, the, surging, hot, and, cold, air, masses, from, spreading, eastward, and, instead, force, them, into, direct, conflict, besides, tornadoes, supercell, thunderstorms, can, also, produce, dangerously, large, hail, and, very, high, winds, for, which, a, severe, thunderstorm, warning, or, tornado, warning, is, usually, issued, even, more, so, than, in, winter, the, jet, streams, play, an, important, role, in, unstable, and, severe, northern, hemisphere, weather, in, springtime, in, recent, decades, season, creep, has, been, observed, which, means, that, many, phenological, signs, of, spring, are, occurring, earlier, in, many, regions, by, around, two, days, per, decade, spring, in, the, southern, hemisphere, is, different, in, several, significant, ways, to, that, of, the, northern, hemisphere, for, several, reasons, including, carnival, is, practiced, by, many, christians, around, the, world, in, the, days, before, lent, 40, days, without, sundays, before, easter, it, is, the, first, spring, festival, of, the,

holiday, has, ancient, origins, and, it, can, relate, to, many, customs, that, have, survived, into, modern, times, many, of, these, customs, are, due, to, may, day, being, a, cross, quarter, day, meaning, that, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, it, is, almost, exclusively, celebrated, it, falls, approximately, halfway, between, the, spring, equinox, and, summer, solstice, in, the, celtic,

april, of, the, gregorian, calendar, on, the, night, of, a, full, moon, after, the, northern, spring, equinox, however, due, to, leap, months, falling, after, the, vernal, equinox, passover, sometimes, starts, on, the, second, full, moon, after, vernal, equinox, as, in, 2016, jews, celebrate, this, holiday, to, commemorate, their, escape, from, slavery, in, egypt, as, described, in, the,
