an, earthquake, also, called, a, quake, tremor, or, temblor, is, the, shaking, of, the, earth, s, surface, resulting, from, a, sudden, release, of, energy, in, the, lithosphere, that, creates, seismic, waves, earthquakes, can, range, in, intensity, from, those, so, weak, they, cannot, be, felt, to, those, violent, enough, to, propel, objects, and, people, into, the, air, damage, critical, infrastructure, and, wreak, destruction, across, entire, cities, the, seismic, activity, of, an, area, is, the, frequency, type, and, size, of, earthquakes, experienced, over, a, particular, time, the, seismicity, at, a, particular, location, in, the, earth, is, the, average, rate, of, seismic, energy, release, per, unit, volume, in, its, most, general, sense, the, word, earthquake, is, used, to, describe, any, seismic, event, that, generates, seismic, waves, earthquakes, can, occur, naturally, or, be, induced, by, human, activities, such, as, mining, fracking, and, nuclear, tests, the, initial, point, of, rupture, is, called, the, hypocenter, or, focus, while, the, ground, level, directly, above, it, is, the, epicenter, earthquakes, are, primarily, caused, by, geological, faults, but, also, by, volcanic, activity, landslides, and, other, seismic, events, the, frequency, type, and, size, of, earthquakes, in, an, area, define, its, seismic, activity, reflecting, the, average, rate, of, seismic, energy, release, significant, historical, earthquakes, include, the, 1556, shaanxi, earthquake, in, china, with, over, 830, 000, fatalities, and, the, 1960, valdivia, earthquake, in, chile, the, largest, ever, recorded, at, 9, 5, magnitude, earthquakes, result, in, various, effects, such, as, ground, shaking, and, soil, liquefaction, leading, to, significant, damage, and, loss, of, life, when, the, epicenter, of, a, large, earthquake, is, located, offshore, the, seabed, may, be, displaced, sufficiently, to, cause, a, tsunami, earthquakes, can, trigger, landslides, earthquakes, occurrence, is, influenced, by, tectonic, movements, along, faults, including, normal, reverse, thrust, and, strike, slip, faults, with, energy, release, and, rupture, dynamics, governed, by, the, elastic, rebound, theory, efforts, to, manage, earthquake, risks, involve, prediction, forecasting, and, preparedness, including, seismic, retrofitting, and, earthquake, engineering, to, design, structures, that, withstand, shaking, the, cultural, impact, of, earthquakes, spans, myths, religious, beliefs, and, modern, media, reflecting, their, profound, influence, on, human, societies, similar, seismic, phenomena, known, as, marsquakes, and, moonquakes, have, been, observed, on, other, celestial, bodies, indicating, the, universality, of, such, events, beyond, earth, an, earthquake, is, the, shaking, of, the, surface, of, earth, resulting, from, a, sudden, release, of, energy, in, the, lithosphere, that, creates, seismic, waves, earthquakes, may, also, be, referred, to, as, quakes, tremors, or, temblors, the, word, tremor, is, also, used, for, non, earthquake, seismic, rumbling, in, its, most, general, sense, an, earthquake, is, any, seismic, event, whether, natural, or, caused, by, humans, that, generates, seismic, waves, earthquakes, are, caused, mostly, by, the, rupture, of, geological, faults, but, also, by, other, events, such, as, volcanic, activity, landslides, mine, blasts, fracking, and, nuclear, tests, an, earthquake, s, point, of, initial, rupture, is, called, its, hypocenter, or, focus, the, epicenter, is, the, point, at, ground, level, directly, above, the, hypocenter, the, seismic, activity, of, an, area, is, the, frequency, type, and, size, of, earthquakes, experienced, over, a, particular, time, the, seismicity, at, a, particular, location, in, the, earth, is, the, average, rate, of, seismic, energy, release, per, unit, volume, one, of, the, most, devastating, earthquakes, in, recorded, history, was, the, 1556, shaanxi, earthquake, which, occurred, on, 23, january, 1556, in, shaanxi, china, more, than, 830, 000, people, died, most, houses, in, the, area, were, yaodongs, dwellings, carved, out, of, loess, hillsides, and, many, victims, were, killed, when, these, structures, collapsed, the, 1976, tangshan, earthquake, which, killed, between, 240, 000, and, 655, 000, people, was, the, deadliest, of, the, 20th, century, the, 1960, chilean, earthquake, is, the, largest, earthquake, that, has, been, measured, on, a, seismograph, reaching, 9, 5, magnitude, on, 22, may, 1960, its, epicenter, was, near, ca, ete, chile, the, energy, released, was, approximately, twice, that, of, the, next, most, powerful, earthquake, the, good, friday, earthquake, 27, march, 1964, which, was, centered, in, prince, william, sound, alaska, the, ten, largest, recorded, earthquakes, have, all, been, megathrust, earthquakes, however, of, these, ten, only, the, 2004, indian, ocean, earthquake, is, simultaneously, one, of, the, deadliest, earthquakes, in, history, earthquakes, that, caused, the, greatest, loss, of, life, while, powerful, were, deadly, because, of, their, proximity, to, either, heavily, populated, areas, or, the, ocean, where, earthquakes, often, create, tsunamis, that, can, devastate, communities, thousands, of, kilometers, away, regions, most, at, risk, for, great, loss, of, life, include, those, where, earthquakes, are, relatively, rare, but, powerful, and, poor, regions, with, lax, unenforced, or, nonexistent, seismic, building, codes, tectonic, earthquakes, occur, anywhere, on, the, earth, where, there, is, sufficient, stored, elastic, strain, energy, to, drive, fracture, propagation, along, a, fault, plane, the, sides, of, a, fault, move, past, each, other, smoothly, and, aseismically, only, if, there, are, no, irregularities, or, asperities, along, the, fault, surface, that, increases, the, frictional, resistance, most, fault, surfaces, do, have, such, asperities, which, leads, to, a, form, of, stick, slip, behavior, once, the, fault, has, locked, continued, relative, motion, between, the, plates, leads, to, increasing, stress, and, therefore, stored, strain, energy, in, the, volume, around, the, fault, surface, this, continues, until, the, stress, has, risen, sufficiently, to, break, through, the, asperity, suddenly, allowing, sliding, over, the, locked, portion, of, the, fault, releasing, the, stored, energy, this, energy, is, released, as, a, combination, of, radiated, elastic, strain, seismic, waves, frictional, heating, of, the, fault, surface, and, cracking, of, the, rock, thus, causing, an, earthquake, this, process, of, gradual, build, up, of, strain, and, stress, punctuated, by, occasional, sudden, earthquake, failure, is, referred, to, as, the, elastic, rebound, theory, it, is, estimated, that, only, 10, percent, or, less, of, an, earthquake, s, total, energy, is, radiated, as, seismic, energy, most, of, the, earthquake, s, energy, is, used, to, power, the, earthquake, fracture, growth, or, is, converted, into, heat, generated, by, friction, therefore, earthquakes, lower, the, earth, s, available, elastic, potential, energy, and, raise, its, temperature, though, these, changes, are, negligible, compared, to, the, conductive, and, convective, flow, of, heat, out, from, the, earth, s, deep, interior, there, are, three, main, types, of, fault, all, of, which, may, cause, an, interplate, earthquake, normal, reverse, thrust, and, strike, slip, normal, and, reverse, faulting, are, examples, of, dip, slip, where, the, displacement, along, the, fault, is, in, the, direction, of, dip, and, where, movement, on, them, involves, a, vertical, component, many, earthquakes, are, caused, by, movement, on, faults, that, have, components, of, both, dip, slip, and, strike, slip, this, is, known, as, oblique, slip, the, topmost, brittle, part, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, the, cool, slabs, of, the, tectonic, plates, that, are, descending, into, the, hot, mantle, are, the, only, parts, of, our, planet, that, can, store, elastic, energy, and, release, it, in, fault, ruptures, rocks, hotter, than, about, 300, c, 572, f, flow, in, response, to, stress, they, do, not, rupture, in, earthquakes, the, maximum, observed, lengths, of, ruptures, and, mapped, faults, which, may, break, in, a, single, rupture, are, approximately, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, examples, are, the, earthquakes, in, alaska, 1957, chile, 1960, and, sumatra, 2004, all, in, subduction, zones, the, longest, earthquake, ruptures, on, strike, slip, faults, like, the, san, andreas, fault, 1857, 1906, the, north, anatolian, fault, in, turkey, 1939, and, the, denali, fault, in, alaska, 2002, are, about, half, to, one, third, as, long, as, the, lengths, along, subducting, plate, margins, and, those, along, normal, faults, are, even, shorter, normal, faults, occur, mainly, in, areas, where, the, crust, is, being, extended, such, as, a, divergent, boundary, earthquakes, associated, with, normal, faults, are, generally, less, than, magnitude, 7, maximum, magnitudes, along, many, normal, faults, are, even, more, limited, because, many, of, them, are, located, along, spreading, centers, as, in, iceland, where, the, thickness, of, the, brittle, layer, is, only, about, six, kilometres, 3, 7, mi, reverse, faults, occur, in, areas, where, the, crust, is, being, shortened, such, as, at, a, convergent, boundary, reverse, faults, particularly, those, along, convergent, boundaries, are, associated, with, the, most, powerful, earthquakes, called, megathrust, earthquakes, including, almost, all, of, those, of, magnitude, 8, or, more, megathrust, earthquakes, are, responsible, for, about, 90, of, the, total, seismic, moment, released, worldwide, strike, slip, faults, are, steep, structures, where, the, two, sides, of, the, fault, slip, horizontally, past, each, other, transform, boundaries, are, a, particular, type, of, strike, slip, fault, strike, slip, faults, particularly, continental, transforms, can, produce, major, earthquakes, up, to, about, magnitude, 8, strike, slip, faults, tend, to, be, oriented, near, vertically, resulting, in, an, approximate, width, of, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, within, the, brittle, crust, thus, earthquakes, with, magnitudes, much, larger, than, 8, are, not, possible, in, addition, there, exists, a, hierarchy, of, stress, levels, in, the, three, fault, types, thrust, faults, are, generated, by, the, highest, strike, slip, by, intermediate, and, normal, faults, by, the, lowest, stress, levels, this, can, easily, be, understood, by, considering, the, direction, of, the, greatest, principal, stress, the, direction, of, the, force, that, pushes, the, rock, mass, during, the, faulting, in, the, case, of, normal, faults, the, rock, mass, is, pushed, down, in, a, vertical, direction, thus, the, pushing, force, greatest, principal, stress, equals, the, weight, of, the, rock, mass, itself, in, the, case, of, thrusting, the, rock, mass, escapes, in, the, direction, of, the, least, principal, stress, namely, upward, lifting, the, rock, mass, and, thus, the, overburden, equals, the, least, principal, stress, strike, slip, faulting, is, intermediate, between, the, other, two, types, described, above, this, difference, in, stress, regime, in, the, three, faulting, environments, can, contribute, to, differences, in, stress, drop, during, faulting, which, contributes, to, differences, in, the, radiated, energy, regardless, of, fault, dimensions, for, every, unit, increase, in, magnitude, there, is, a, roughly, thirty, fold, increase, in, the, energy, released, for, instance, an, earthquake, of, magnitude, 6, 0, releases, approximately, 32, times, more, energy, than, a, 5, 0, magnitude, earthquake, and, a, 7, 0, magnitude, earthquake, releases, 1, 000, times, more, energy, than, a, 5, 0, magnitude, earthquake, an, 8, 6, magnitude, earthquake, releases, the, same, amount, of, energy, as, 10, 000, atomic, bombs, of, the, size, used, in, world, war, ii, this, is, so, because, the, energy, released, in, an, earthquake, and, thus, its, magnitude, is, proportional, to, the, area, of, the, fault, that, ruptures, and, the, stress, drop, therefore, the, longer, the, length, and, the, wider, the, width, of, the, faulted, area, the, larger, the, resulting, magnitude, the, most, important, parameter, controlling, the, maximum, earthquake, magnitude, on, a, fault, however, is, not, the, maximum, available, length, but, the, available, width, because, the, latter, varies, by, a, factor, of, 20, along, converging, plate, margins, the, dip, angle, of, the, rupture, plane, is, very, shallow, typically, about, 10, degrees, thus, the, width, of, the, plane, within, the, top, brittle, crust, of, the, earth, can, reach, 50, 100, km, 31, 62, mi, such, as, in, japan, 2011, or, in, alaska, 1964, making, the, most, powerful, earthquakes, possible, the, majority, of, tectonic, earthquakes, originate, in, the, ring, of, fire, at, depths, not, exceeding, tens, of, kilometers, earthquakes, occurring, at, a, depth, of, less, than, 70, km, 43, mi, are, classified, as, shallow, focus, earthquakes, while, those, with, a, focal, depth, between, 70, and, 300, km, 43, and, 186, mi, are, commonly, termed, mid, focus, or, intermediate, depth, earthquakes, in, subduction, zones, where, older, and, colder, oceanic, crust, descends, beneath, another, tectonic, plate, deep, focus, earthquakes, may, occur, at, much, greater, depths, ranging, from, 300, to, 700, km, 190, to, 430, mi, these, seismically, active, areas, of, subduction, are, known, as, wadati, benioff, zones, deep, focus, earthquakes, occur, at, a, depth, where, the, subducted, lithosphere, should, no, longer, be, brittle, due, to, the, high, temperature, and, pressure, a, possible, mechanism, for, the, generation, of, deep, focus, earthquakes, is, faulting, caused, by, olivine, undergoing, a, phase, transition, into, a, spinel, structure, earthquakes, often, occur, in, volcanic, regions, and, are, caused, there, both, by, tectonic, faults, and, the, movement, of, magma, in, volcanoes, such, earthquakes, can, serve, as, an, early, warning, of, volcanic, eruptions, as, during, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, earthquake, swarms, can, serve, as, markers, for, the, location, of, the, flowing, magma, throughout, the, volcanoes, these, swarms, can, be, recorded, by, seismometers, and, tiltmeters, a, device, that, measures, ground, slope, and, used, as, sensors, to, predict, imminent, or, upcoming, eruptions, a, tectonic, earthquake, begins, as, an, area, of, initial, slip, on, the, fault, surface, that, forms, the, focus, once, the, rupture, has, been, initiated, it, begins, to, propagate, away, from, the, focus, spreading, out, along, the, fault, surface, lateral, propagation, will, continue, until, either, the, rupture, reaches, a, barrier, such, as, the, end, of, a, fault, segment, or, a, region, on, the, fault, where, there, is, insufficient, stress, to, allow, continued, rupture, for, larger, earthquakes, the, depth, extent, of, rupture, will, be, constrained, downwards, by, the, brittle, ductile, transition, zone, and, upwards, by, the, ground, surface, the, mechanics, of, this, process, are, poorly, understood, because, it, is, difficult, either, to, recreate, such, rapid, movements, in, a, laboratory, or, to, record, seismic, waves, close, to, a, nucleation, zone, due, to, strong, ground, motion, in, most, cases, the, rupture, speed, approaches, but, does, not, exceed, the, shear, wave, s, wave, velocity, of, the, surrounding, rock, there, are, a, few, exceptions, to, this, supershear, earthquake, ruptures, are, known, to, have, propagated, at, speeds, greater, than, the, s, wave, velocity, these, have, so, far, all, been, observed, during, large, strike, slip, events, the, unusually, wide, zone, of, damage, caused, by, the, 2001, kunlun, earthquake, has, been, attributed, to, the, effects, of, the, sonic, boom, developed, in, such, earthquakes, slow, earthquake, ruptures, travel, at, unusually, low, velocities, a, particularly, dangerous, form, of, slow, earthquake, is, the, tsunami, earthquake, observed, where, the, relatively, low, felt, intensities, caused, by, the, slow, propagation, speed, of, some, great, earthquakes, fail, to, alert, the, population, of, the, neighboring, coast, as, in, the, 1896, sanriku, earthquake, during, an, earthquake, high, temperatures, can, develop, at, the, fault, plane, increasing, pore, pressure, and, consequently, vaporization, of, the, groundwater, already, contained, within, the, rock, in, the, coseismic, phase, such, an, increase, can, significantly, affect, slip, evolution, and, speed, in, the, post, seismic, phase, it, can, control, the, aftershock, sequence, because, after, the, main, event, pore, pressure, increase, slowly, propagates, into, the, surrounding, fracture, network, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, mohr, coulomb, strength, theory, an, increase, in, fluid, pressure, reduces, the, normal, stress, acting, on, the, fault, plane, that, holds, it, in, place, and, fluids, can, exert, a, lubricating, effect, as, thermal, overpressurization, may, provide, positive, feedback, between, slip, and, strength, fall, at, the, fault, plane, a, common, opinion, is, that, it, may, enhance, the, faulting, process, instability, after, the, mainshock, the, pressure, gradient, between, the, fault, plane, and, the, neighboring, rock, causes, a, fluid, flow, that, increases, pore, pressure, in, the, surrounding, fracture, networks, such, an, increase, may, trigger, new, faulting, processes, by, reactivating, adjacent, faults, giving, rise, to, aftershocks, analogously, artificial, pore, pressure, increase, by, fluid, injection, in, earth, s, crust, may, induce, seismicity, tides, may, trigger, some, seismicity, most, earthquakes, form, part, of, a, sequence, related, to, each, other, in, terms, of, location, and, time, most, earthquake, clusters, consist, of, small, tremors, that, cause, little, to, no, damage, but, there, is, a, theory, that, earthquakes, can, recur, in, a, regular, pattern, earthquake, clustering, has, been, observed, for, example, in, parkfield, california, where, a, long, term, research, study, is, being, conducted, around, the, parkfield, earthquake, cluster, an, aftershock, is, an, earthquake, that, occurs, after, a, previous, earthquake, the, mainshock, rapid, changes, of, stress, between, rocks, and, the, stress, from, the, original, earthquake, are, the, main, causes, of, these, aftershocks, along, with, the, crust, around, the, ruptured, fault, plane, as, it, adjusts, to, the, effects, of, the, mainshock, an, aftershock, is, in, the, same, region, as, the, main, shock, but, always, of, a, smaller, magnitude, however, they, can, still, be, powerful, enough, to, cause, even, more, damage, to, buildings, that, were, already, previously, damaged, from, the, mainshock, if, an, aftershock, is, larger, than, the, mainshock, the, aftershock, is, redesignated, as, the, mainshock, and, the, original, main, shock, is, redesignated, as, a, foreshock, aftershocks, are, formed, as, the, crust, around, the, displaced, fault, plane, adjusts, to, the, effects, of, the, mainshock, earthquake, swarms, are, sequences, of, earthquakes, striking, in, a, specific, area, within, a, short, period, they, are, different, from, earthquakes, followed, by, a, series, of, aftershocks, by, the, fact, that, no, single, earthquake, in, the, sequence, is, the, main, shock, so, none, has, a, notably, higher, magnitude, than, another, an, example, of, an, earthquake, swarm, is, the, 2004, activity, at, yellowstone, national, park, in, august, 2012, a, swarm, of, earthquakes, shook, southern, california, s, imperial, valley, showing, the, most, recorded, activity, in, the, area, since, the, 1970s, sometimes, a, series, of, earthquakes, occur, in, what, has, been, called, an, earthquake, storm, where, the, earthquakes, strike, a, fault, in, clusters, each, triggered, by, the, shaking, or, stress, redistribution, of, the, previous, earthquakes, similar, to, aftershocks, but, on, adjacent, segments, of, fault, these, storms, occur, over, the, course, of, years, with, some, of, the, later, earthquakes, as, damaging, as, the, early, ones, such, a, pattern, was, observed, in, the, sequence, of, about, a, dozen, earthquakes, that, struck, the, north, anatolian, fault, in, turkey, in, the, 20th, century, and, has, been, inferred, for, older, anomalous, clusters, of, large, earthquakes, in, the, middle, east, it, is, estimated, that, around, 500, 000, earthquakes, occur, each, year, detectable, with, current, instrumentation, about, 100, 000, of, these, can, be, felt, minor, earthquakes, occur, very, frequently, around, the, world, in, places, like, california, and, alaska, in, the, u, s, as, well, as, in, el, salvador, mexico, guatemala, chile, peru, indonesia, the, philippines, iran, pakistan, the, azores, in, portugal, turkey, new, zealand, greece, italy, india, nepal, and, japan, larger, earthquakes, occur, less, frequently, the, relationship, being, exponential, for, example, roughly, ten, times, as, many, earthquakes, larger, than, magnitude, 4, occur, than, earthquakes, larger, than, magnitude, 5, in, the, low, seismicity, united, kingdom, for, example, it, has, been, calculated, that, the, average, recurrences, are, an, earthquake, of, 3, 7, 4, 6, every, year, an, earthquake, of, 4, 7, 5, 5, every, 10, years, and, an, earthquake, of, 5, 6, or, larger, every, 100, years, this, is, an, example, of, the, gutenberg, richter, law, the, number, of, seismic, stations, has, increased, from, about, 350, in, 1931, to, many, thousands, today, as, a, result, many, more, earthquakes, are, reported, than, in, the, past, but, this, is, because, of, the, vast, improvement, in, instrumentation, rather, than, an, increase, in, the, number, of, earthquakes, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, estimates, that, since, 1900, there, have, been, an, average, of, 18, major, earthquakes, magnitude, 7, 0, 7, 9, and, one, great, earthquake, magnitude, 8, 0, or, greater, per, year, and, that, this, average, has, been, relatively, stable, in, recent, years, the, number, of, major, earthquakes, per, year, has, decreased, though, this, is, probably, a, statistical, fluctuation, rather, than, a, systematic, trend, more, detailed, statistics, on, the, size, and, frequency, of, earthquakes, is, available, from, the, united, states, geological, survey, a, recent, increase, in, the, number, of, major, earthquakes, has, been, noted, which, could, be, explained, by, a, cyclical, pattern, of, periods, of, intense, tectonic, activity, interspersed, with, longer, periods, of, low, intensity, however, accurate, recordings, of, earthquakes, only, began, in, the, early, 1900s, so, it, is, too, early, to, categorically, state, that, this, is, the, case, most, of, the, world, s, earthquakes, 90, and, 81, of, the, largest, take, place, in, the, 40, 000, kilometre, long, 25, 000, mi, horseshoe, shaped, zone, called, the, circum, pacific, seismic, belt, known, as, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, which, for, the, most, part, bounds, the, pacific, plate, massive, earthquakes, tend, to, occur, along, other, plate, boundaries, too, such, as, along, the, himalayan, mountains, with, the, rapid, growth, of, mega, cities, such, as, mexico, city, tokyo, and, tehran, in, areas, of, high, seismic, risk, some, seismologists, are, warning, that, a, single, earthquake, may, claim, the, lives, of, up, to, three, million, people, while, most, earthquakes, are, caused, by, the, movement, of, the, earth, s, tectonic, plates, human, activity, can, also, produce, earthquakes, activities, both, above, ground, and, below, may, change, the, stresses, and, strains, on, the, crust, including, building, reservoirs, extracting, resources, such, as, coal, or, oil, and, injecting, fluids, underground, for, waste, disposal, or, fracking, most, of, these, earthquakes, have, small, magnitudes, the, 5, 7, magnitude, 2011, oklahoma, earthquake, is, thought, to, have, been, caused, by, disposing, wastewater, from, oil, production, into, injection, wells, and, studies, point, to, the, state, s, oil, industry, as, the, cause, of, other, earthquakes, in, the, past, century, a, columbia, university, paper, suggested, that, the, 8, 0, magnitude, 2008, sichuan, earthquake, was, induced, by, loading, from, the, zipingpu, dam, though, the, link, has, not, been, conclusively, proved, the, instrumental, scales, used, to, describe, the, size, of, an, earthquake, began, with, the, richter, magnitude, scale, in, the, 1930s, it, is, a, relatively, simple, measurement, of, an, event, s, amplitude, and, its, use, has, become, minimal, in, the, 21st, century, seismic, waves, travel, through, the, earth, s, interior, and, can, be, recorded, by, seismometers, at, great, distances, the, surface, wave, magnitude, was, developed, in, the, 1950s, as, a, means, to, measure, remote, earthquakes, and, to, improve, the, accuracy, for, larger, events, the, moment, magnitude, scale, not, only, measures, the, amplitude, of, the, shock, but, also, takes, into, account, the, seismic, moment, total, rupture, area, average, slip, of, the, fault, and, rigidity, of, the, rock, the, japan, meteorological, agency, seismic, intensity, scale, the, medvedev, sponheuer, karnik, scale, and, the, mercalli, intensity, scale, are, based, on, the, observed, effects, and, are, related, to, the, intensity, of, shaking, the, shaking, of, the, earth, is, a, common, phenomenon, that, has, been, experienced, by, humans, from, the, earliest, of, times, before, the, development, of, strong, motion, accelerometers, the, intensity, of, a, seismic, event, was, estimated, based, on, the, observed, effects, magnitude, and, intensity, are, not, directly, related, and, calculated, using, different, methods, the, magnitude, of, an, earthquake, is, a, single, value, that, describes, the, size, of, the, earthquake, at, its, source, intensity, is, the, measure, of, shaking, at, different, locations, around, the, earthquake, intensity, values, vary, from, place, to, place, depending, on, the, distance, from, the, earthquake, and, the, underlying, rock, or, soil, makeup, the, first, scale, for, measuring, earthquake, magnitudes, was, developed, by, charles, francis, richter, in, 1935, subsequent, scales, seismic, magnitude, scales, have, retained, a, key, feature, where, each, unit, represents, a, ten, fold, difference, in, the, amplitude, of, the, ground, shaking, and, a, 32, fold, difference, in, energy, subsequent, scales, are, also, adjusted, to, have, approximately, the, same, numeric, value, within, the, limits, of, the, scale, although, the, mass, media, commonly, reports, earthquake, magnitudes, as, richter, magnitude, or, richter, scale, standard, practice, by, most, seismological, authorities, is, to, express, an, earthquake, s, strength, on, the, moment, magnitude, scale, which, is, based, on, the, actual, energy, released, by, an, earthquake, the, static, seismic, moment, every, earthquake, produces, different, types, of, seismic, waves, which, travel, through, rock, with, different, velocities, propagation, velocity, of, the, seismic, waves, through, solid, rock, ranges, from, approx, 3, km, s, 1, 9, mi, s, up, to, 13, km, s, 8, 1, mi, s, depending, on, the, density, and, elasticity, of, the, medium, in, the, earth, s, interior, the, shock, or, p, waves, travel, much, faster, than, the, s, waves, approx, relation, 1, 7, 1, the, differences, in, travel, time, from, the, epicenter, to, the, observatory, are, a, measure, of, the, distance, and, can, be, used, to, image, both, sources, of, earthquakes, and, structures, within, the, earth, also, the, depth, of, the, hypocenter, can, be, computed, roughly, p, wave, speed, s, waves, speed, as, a, consequence, the, first, waves, of, a, distant, earthquake, arrive, at, an, observatory, via, the, earth, s, mantle, on, average, the, kilometer, distance, to, the, earthquake, is, the, number, of, seconds, between, the, p, and, s, wave, times, 8, slight, deviations, are, caused, by, inhomogeneities, of, subsurface, structure, by, such, analysis, of, seismograms, the, earth, s, core, was, located, in, 1913, by, beno, gutenberg, s, waves, and, later, arriving, surface, waves, do, most, of, the, damage, compared, to, p, waves, p, waves, squeeze, and, expand, the, material, in, the, same, direction, they, are, traveling, whereas, s, waves, shake, the, ground, up, and, down, and, back, and, forth, earthquakes, are, not, only, categorized, by, their, magnitude, but, also, by, the, place, where, they, occur, the, world, is, divided, into, 754, flinn, engdahl, regions, f, e, regions, which, are, based, on, political, and, geographical, boundaries, as, well, as, seismic, activity, more, active, zones, are, divided, into, smaller, f, e, regions, whereas, less, active, zones, belong, to, larger, f, e, regions, standard, reporting, of, earthquakes, includes, its, magnitude, date, and, time, of, occurrence, geographic, coordinates, of, its, epicenter, depth, of, the, epicenter, geographical, region, distances, to, population, centers, location, uncertainty, several, parameters, that, are, included, in, usgs, earthquake, reports, number, of, stations, reporting, number, of, observations, etc, and, a, unique, event, id, although, relatively, slow, seismic, waves, have, traditionally, been, used, to, detect, earthquakes, scientists, realized, in, 2016, that, gravitational, measurement, could, provide, instantaneous, detection, of, earthquakes, and, confirmed, this, by, analyzing, gravitational, records, associated, with, the, 2011, tohoku, oki, fukushima, earthquake, the, effects, of, earthquakes, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, following, shaking, and, ground, rupture, are, the, main, effects, created, by, earthquakes, principally, resulting, in, more, or, less, severe, damage, to, buildings, and, other, rigid, structures, the, severity, of, the, local, effects, depends, on, the, complex, combination, of, the, earthquake, magnitude, the, distance, from, the, epicenter, and, the, local, geological, and, geomorphological, conditions, which, may, amplify, or, reduce, wave, propagation, the, ground, shaking, is, measured, by, ground, acceleration, specific, local, geological, geomorphological, and, geostructural, features, can, induce, high, levels, of, shaking, on, the, ground, surface, even, from, low, intensity, earthquakes, this, effect, is, called, site, or, local, amplification, it, is, principally, due, to, the, transfer, of, the, seismic, motion, from, hard, deep, soils, to, soft, superficial, soils, and, the, effects, of, seismic, energy, focalization, owing, to, the, typical, geometrical, setting, of, such, deposits, ground, rupture, is, a, visible, breaking, and, displacement, of, the, earth, s, surface, along, the, trace, of, the, fault, which, may, be, of, the, order, of, several, meters, in, the, case, of, major, earthquakes, ground, rupture, is, a, major, risk, for, large, engineering, structures, such, as, dams, bridges, and, nuclear, power, stations, and, requires, careful, mapping, of, existing, faults, to, identify, any, that, are, likely, to, break, the, ground, surface, within, the, life, of, the, structure, soil, liquefaction, occurs, when, because, of, the, shaking, water, saturated, granular, material, such, as, sand, temporarily, loses, its, strength, and, transforms, from, a, solid, to, a, liquid, soil, liquefaction, may, cause, rigid, structures, like, buildings, and, bridges, to, tilt, or, sink, into, the, liquefied, deposits, for, example, in, the, 1964, alaska, earthquake, soil, liquefaction, caused, many, buildings, to, sink, into, the, ground, eventually, collapsing, upon, themselves, physical, damage, from, an, earthquake, will, vary, depending, on, the, intensity, of, shaking, in, a, given, area, and, the, type, of, population, underserved, and, developing, communities, frequently, experience, more, severe, impacts, and, longer, lasting, from, a, seismic, event, compared, to, well, developed, communities, impacts, may, include, with, these, impacts, and, others, the, aftermath, may, bring, disease, a, lack, of, basic, necessities, mental, consequences, such, as, panic, attacks, and, depression, to, survivors, and, higher, insurance, premiums, recovery, times, will, vary, based, on, the, level, of, damage, and, the, socioeconomic, status, of, the, impacted, community, earthquakes, can, produce, slope, instability, leading, to, landslides, a, major, geological, hazard, landslide, danger, may, persist, while, emergency, personnel, is, attempting, rescue, work, earthquakes, can, cause, fires, by, damaging, electrical, power, or, gas, lines, in, the, event, of, water, mains, rupturing, and, a, loss, of, pressure, it, may, also, become, difficult, to, stop, the, spread, of, a, fire, once, it, has, started, for, example, more, deaths, in, the, 1906, san, francisco, earthquake, were, caused, by, fire, than, by, the, earthquake, itself, tsunamis, are, long, wavelength, long, period, sea, waves, produced, by, the, sudden, or, abrupt, movement, of, large, volumes, of, water, including, when, an, earthquake, occurs, at, sea, in, the, open, ocean, the, distance, between, wave, crests, can, surpass, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, and, the, wave, periods, can, vary, from, five, minutes, to, one, hour, such, tsunamis, travel, 600, 800, kilometers, per, hour, 373, 497, miles, per, hour, depending, on, water, depth, large, waves, produced, by, an, earthquake, or, a, submarine, landslide, can, overrun, nearby, coastal, areas, in, a, matter, of, minutes, tsunamis, can, also, travel, thousands, of, kilometers, across, open, ocean, and, wreak, destruction, on, far, shores, hours, after, the, earthquake, that, generated, them, ordinarily, subduction, earthquakes, under, magnitude, 7, 5, do, not, cause, tsunamis, although, some, instances, of, this, have, been, recorded, most, destructive, tsunamis, are, caused, by, earthquakes, of, magnitude, 7, 5, or, more, floods, may, be, secondary, effects, of, earthquakes, if, dams, are, damaged, earthquakes, may, cause, landslips, to, dam, rivers, which, collapse, and, cause, floods, the, terrain, below, the, sarez, lake, in, tajikistan, is, in, danger, of, catastrophic, flooding, if, the, landslide, dam, formed, by, the, earthquake, known, as, the, usoi, dam, were, to, fail, during, a, future, earthquake, impact, projections, suggest, the, flood, could, affect, roughly, five, million, people, earthquake, prediction, is, a, branch, of, the, science, of, seismology, concerned, with, the, specification, of, the, time, location, and, magnitude, of, future, earthquakes, within, stated, limits, many, methods, have, been, developed, for, predicting, the, time, and, place, in, which, earthquakes, will, occur, despite, considerable, research, efforts, by, seismologists, scientifically, reproducible, predictions, cannot, yet, be, made, to, a, specific, day, or, month, popular, belief, holds, earthquakes, are, preceded, by, earthquake, weather, in, the, early, morning, while, forecasting, is, usually, considered, to, be, a, type, of, prediction, earthquake, forecasting, is, often, differentiated, from, earthquake, prediction, earthquake, forecasting, is, concerned, with, the, probabilistic, assessment, of, general, earthquake, hazards, including, the, frequency, and, magnitude, of, damaging, earthquakes, in, a, given, area, over, years, or, decades, for, well, understood, faults, the, probability, that, a, segment, may, rupture, during, the, next, few, decades, can, be, estimated, earthquake, warning, systems, have, been, developed, that, can, provide, regional, notification, of, an, earthquake, in, progress, but, before, the, ground, surface, has, begun, to, move, potentially, allowing, people, within, the, system, s, range, to, seek, shelter, before, the, earthquake, s, impact, is, felt, the, objective, of, earthquake, engineering, is, to, foresee, the, impact, of, earthquakes, on, buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and, other, structures, and, to, design, such, structures, to, minimize, the, risk, of, damage, existing, structures, can, be, modified, by, seismic, retrofitting, to, improve, their, resistance, to, earthquakes, earthquake, insurance, can, provide, building, owners, with, financial, protection, against, losses, resulting, from, earthquakes, emergency, management, strategies, can, be, employed, by, a, government, or, organization, to, mitigate, risks, and, prepare, for, consequences, artificial, intelligence, may, help, to, assess, buildings, and, plan, precautionary, operations, the, igor, expert, system, is, part, of, a, mobile, laboratory, that, supports, the, procedures, leading, to, the, seismic, assessment, of, masonry, buildings, and, the, planning, of, retrofitting, operations, on, them, it, has, been, applied, to, assess, buildings, in, lisbon, rhodes, and, naples, individuals, can, also, take, preparedness, steps, like, securing, water, heaters, and, heavy, items, that, could, injure, someone, locating, shutoffs, for, utilities, and, being, educated, about, what, to, do, when, the, shaking, starts, for, areas, near, large, bodies, of, water, earthquake, preparedness, encompasses, the, possibility, of, a, tsunami, caused, by, a, large, earthquake, from, the, lifetime, of, the, greek, philosopher, anaxagoras, in, the, 5th, century, bce, to, the, 14th, century, ce, earthquakes, were, usually, attributed, to, air, vapors, in, the, cavities, of, the, earth, thales, of, miletus, 625, 547, bce, was, the, only, documented, person, who, believed, that, earthquakes, were, caused, by, tension, between, the, earth, and, water, other, theories, existed, including, the, greek, philosopher, anaxamines, 585, 526, bce, beliefs, that, short, incline, episodes, of, dryness, and, wetness, caused, seismic, activity, the, greek, philosopher, democritus, 460, 371, bce, blamed, water, in, general, for, earthquakes, pliny, the, elder, called, earthquakes, underground, thunderstorms, in, norse, mythology, earthquakes, were, explained, as, the, violent, struggle, of, the, god, loki, when, loki, god, of, mischief, and, strife, murdered, baldr, god, of, beauty, and, light, he, was, punished, by, being, bound, in, a, cave, with, a, poisonous, serpent, placed, above, his, head, dripping, venom, loki, s, wife, sigyn, stood, by, him, with, a, bowl, to, catch, the, poison, but, whenever, she, had, to, empty, the, bowl, the, poison, dripped, on, loki, s, face, forcing, him, to, jerk, his, head, away, and, thrash, against, his, bonds, which, caused, the, earth, to, tremble, in, greek, mythology, poseidon, was, the, cause, and, god, of, earthquakes, when, he, was, in, a, bad, mood, he, struck, the, ground, with, a, trident, causing, earthquakes, and, other, calamities, he, also, used, earthquakes, to, punish, and, inflict, fear, upon, people, as, revenge, in, japanese, mythology, namazu, is, a, giant, catfish, who, causes, earthquakes, namazu, lives, in, the, mud, beneath, the, earth, and, is, guarded, by, the, god, kashima, who, restrains, the, fish, with, a, stone, when, kashima, lets, his, guard, fall, namazu, thrashes, about, causing, violent, earthquakes, in, the, new, testament, matthew, s, gospel, refers, to, earthquakes, occurring, both, after, the, death, of, jesus, matthew, 27, 51, 54, and, at, his, resurrection, matthew, 28, 2, earthquakes, form, part, of, the, picture, through, which, jesus, portrays, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, time, in, modern, popular, culture, the, portrayal, of, earthquakes, is, shaped, by, the, memory, of, great, cities, laid, waste, such, as, kobe, in, 1995, or, san, francisco, in, 1906, fictional, earthquakes, tend, to, strike, suddenly, and, without, warning, for, this, reason, stories, about, earthquakes, generally, begin, with, the, disaster, and, focus, on, its, immediate, aftermath, as, in, short, walk, to, daylight, 1972, the, ragged, edge, 1968, or, aftershock, earthquake, in, new, york, 1999, a, notable, example, is, heinrich, von, kleist, s, classic, novella, the, earthquake, in, chile, which, describes, the, destruction, of, santiago, in, 1647, haruki, murakami, s, short, fiction, collection, after, the, quake, depicts, the, consequences, of, the, kobe, earthquake, of, 1995, the, most, popular, single, earthquake, in, fiction, is, the, hypothetical, big, one, expected, of, california, s, san, andreas, fault, someday, as, depicted, in, the, novels, richter, 10, 1996, goodbye, california, 1977, 2012, 2009, and, san, andreas, 2015, among, other, works, jacob, m, appel, s, widely, anthologized, short, story, a, comparative, seismology, features, a, con, artist, who, convinces, an, elderly, woman, that, an, apocalyptic, earthquake, is, imminent, contemporary, depictions, of, earthquakes, in, film, are, variable, in, the, manner, in, which, they, reflect, human, psychological, reactions, to, the, actual, trauma, that, can, be, caused, to, directly, afflicted, families, and, their, loved, ones, disaster, mental, health, response, research, emphasizes, the, need, to, be, aware, of, the, different, roles, of, loss, of, family, and, key, community, members, loss, of, home, and, familiar, surroundings, and, loss, of, essential, supplies, and, services, to, maintain, survival, particularly, for, children, the, clear, availability, of, caregiving, adults, who, can, protect, nourish, and, clothe, them, in, the, aftermath, of, the, earthquake, and, help, them, make, sense, of, what, has, befallen, them, has, been, shown, to, be, more, important, to, their, emotional, and, physical, health, than, the, simple, giving, of, provisions, as, was, observed, after, other, disasters, involving, destruction, and, loss, of, life, and, their, media, depictions, recently, observed, in, the, 2010, haiti, earthquake, it, is, also, believed, to, be, important, not, to, pathologize, the, reactions, to, loss, and, displacement, or, disruption, of, governmental, administration, and, services, but, rather, to, validate, the, reactions, to, support, constructive, problem, solving, and, reflection, phenomena, similar, to, earthquakes, have, been, observed, in, other, planets, e, g, marsquakes, on, mars, and, on, the, moon, e, g, moonquakes
