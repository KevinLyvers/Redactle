https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units
the, international, system, of, units, internationally, known, by, the, abbreviation, si, from, french, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, is, the, modern, form, of, the, metric, system, and, the, world, s, most, widely, used, system, of, measurement, coordinated, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, abbreviated, bipm, from, french, bureau, international, des, poids, et, mesures, it, is, the, only, system, of, measurement, with, official, status, in, nearly, every, country, in, the, world, employed, in, science, technology, industry, and, everyday, commerce, the, si, comprises, a, coherent, system, of, units, of, measurement, starting, with, seven, base, units, which, are, the, second, symbol, s, the, unit, of, time, metre, m, length, kilogram, kg, mass, ampere, a, electric, current, kelvin, k, thermodynamic, temperature, mole, mol, amount, of, substance, and, candela, cd, luminous, intensity, the, system, can, accommodate, coherent, units, for, an, unlimited, number, of, additional, quantities, these, are, called, coherent, derived, units, which, can, always, be, represented, as, products, of, powers, of, the, base, units, twenty, two, coherent, derived, units, have, been, provided, with, special, names, and, symbols, the, seven, base, units, and, the, 22, coherent, derived, units, with, special, names, and, symbols, may, be, used, in, combination, to, express, other, coherent, derived, units, since, the, sizes, of, coherent, units, will, be, convenient, for, only, some, applications, and, not, for, others, the, si, provides, twenty, four, prefixes, which, when, added, to, the, name, and, symbol, of, a, coherent, unit, produce, twenty, four, additional, non, coherent, si, units, for, the, same, quantity, these, non, coherent, units, are, always, decimal, i, e, power, of, ten, multiples, and, sub, multiples, of, the, coherent, unit, the, current, way, of, defining, the, si, is, a, result, of, a, decades, long, move, towards, increasingly, abstract, and, idealised, formulation, in, which, the, realisations, of, the, units, are, separated, conceptually, from, the, definitions, a, consequence, is, that, as, science, and, technologies, develop, new, and, superior, realisations, may, be, introduced, without, the, need, to, redefine, the, unit, one, problem, with, artefacts, is, that, they, can, be, lost, damaged, or, changed, another, is, that, they, introduce, uncertainties, that, cannot, be, reduced, by, advancements, in, science, and, technology, the, original, motivation, for, the, development, of, the, si, was, the, diversity, of, units, that, had, sprung, up, within, the, centimetre, gram, second, cgs, systems, specifically, the, inconsistency, between, the, systems, of, electrostatic, units, and, electromagnetic, units, and, the, lack, of, coordination, between, the, various, disciplines, that, used, them, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, french, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, cgpm, which, was, established, by, the, metre, convention, of, 1875, brought, together, many, international, organisations, to, establish, the, definitions, and, standards, of, a, new, system, and, to, standardise, the, rules, for, writing, and, presenting, measurements, the, system, was, published, in, 1960, as, a, result, of, an, initiative, that, began, in, 1948, and, is, based, on, the, metre, kilogram, second, system, of, units, mks, combined, with, ideas, from, the, development, of, the, cgs, system, the, international, system, of, units, consists, of, a, set, of, defining, constants, with, corresponding, base, units, derived, units, and, a, set, of, decimal, based, multipliers, that, are, used, as, prefixes, 125, the, seven, defining, constants, are, the, most, fundamental, feature, of, the, definition, of, the, system, of, units, 125, the, magnitudes, of, all, si, units, are, defined, by, declaring, that, seven, constants, have, certain, exact, numerical, values, when, expressed, in, terms, of, their, si, units, these, defining, constants, are, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, the, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, caesium, cs, the, planck, constant, h, the, elementary, charge, e, the, boltzmann, constant, k, the, avogadro, constant, n, a, and, the, luminous, efficacy, k, cd, the, nature, of, the, defining, constants, ranges, from, fundamental, constants, of, nature, such, as, c, to, the, purely, technical, constant, k, cd, the, values, assigned, to, these, constants, were, fixed, to, ensure, continuity, with, previous, definitions, of, the, base, units, 128, the, si, selects, seven, units, to, serve, as, base, units, corresponding, to, seven, base, physical, quantities, they, are, the, second, with, the, symbol, s, which, is, the, si, unit, of, the, physical, quantity, of, time, the, metre, symbol, m, the, si, unit, of, length, kilogram, kg, the, unit, of, mass, ampere, a, electric, current, kelvin, k, thermodynamic, temperature, mole, mol, amount, of, substance, and, candela, cd, luminous, intensity, the, base, units, are, defined, in, terms, of, the, defining, constants, for, example, the, kilogram, is, defined, by, taking, the, planck, constant, h, to, be, 6, 626, 070, 15, 10, 34, j, s, giving, the, expression, in, terms, of, the, defining, constants, 131, all, units, in, the, si, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, base, units, and, the, base, units, serve, as, a, preferred, set, for, expressing, or, analysing, the, relationships, between, units, the, choice, of, which, and, even, how, many, quantities, to, use, as, base, quantities, is, not, fundamental, or, even, unique, it, is, a, matter, of, convention, 126, the, system, allows, for, an, unlimited, number, of, additional, units, called, derived, units, which, can, always, be, represented, as, products, of, powers, of, the, base, units, possibly, with, a, nontrivial, numeric, multiplier, when, that, multiplier, is, one, the, unit, is, called, a, coherent, derived, unit, for, example, the, coherent, derived, si, unit, unit, of, velocity, is, the, metre, per, second, with, the, symbol, m, s, 139, the, base, and, coherent, derived, units, of, the, si, together, form, a, coherent, system, of, units, the, set, of, coherent, si, units, a, useful, property, of, a, coherent, system, is, that, when, the, numerical, values, of, physical, quantities, are, expressed, in, terms, of, the, units, of, the, system, then, the, equations, between, the, numerical, values, have, exactly, the, same, form, including, numerical, factors, as, the, corresponding, equations, between, the, physical, quantities, 6, twenty, two, coherent, derived, units, have, been, provided, with, special, names, and, symbols, as, shown, in, the, table, below, the, radian, and, steradian, have, no, base, units, but, are, treated, as, derived, units, for, historical, reasons, 137, the, derived, units, in, the, si, are, formed, by, powers, products, or, quotients, of, the, base, units, and, are, unlimited, in, number, 103, 14, 16, derived, units, apply, to, some, derived, quantities, which, may, by, definition, be, expressed, in, terms, of, base, quantities, and, thus, are, not, independent, for, example, electrical, conductance, is, the, inverse, of, electrical, resistance, with, the, consequence, that, the, siemens, is, the, inverse, of, the, ohm, and, similarly, the, ohm, and, siemens, can, be, replaced, with, a, ratio, of, an, ampere, and, a, volt, because, those, quantities, bear, a, defined, relationship, to, each, other, other, useful, derived, quantities, can, be, specified, in, terms, of, the, si, base, and, derived, units, that, have, no, named, units, in, the, si, such, as, acceleration, which, has, the, si, unit, m, s, 2, 139, a, combination, of, base, and, derived, units, may, be, used, to, express, a, derived, unit, for, example, the, si, unit, of, force, is, the, newton, n, the, si, unit, of, pressure, is, the, pascal, pa, and, the, pascal, can, be, defined, as, one, newton, per, square, metre, n, m, 2, like, all, metric, systems, the, si, uses, metric, prefixes, to, systematically, construct, for, the, same, physical, quantity, a, set, of, units, that, are, decimal, multiples, of, each, other, over, a, wide, range, for, example, driving, distances, are, normally, given, in, kilometres, symbol, km, rather, than, in, metres, here, the, metric, prefix, kilo, symbol, k, stands, for, a, factor, of, 1000, thus, 1, km, 1000, m, the, si, provides, twenty, four, metric, prefixes, that, signify, decimal, powers, ranging, from, 10, 30, to, 10, 30, the, most, recent, being, adopted, in, 2022, 143, 144, most, prefixes, correspond, to, integer, powers, of, 1000, the, only, ones, that, do, not, are, those, for, 10, 1, 10, 100, and, 1, 100, the, conversion, between, different, si, units, for, one, and, the, same, physical, quantity, is, always, through, a, power, of, ten, this, is, why, the, si, and, metric, systems, more, generally, are, called, decimal, systems, of, measurement, units, the, grouping, formed, by, a, prefix, symbol, attached, to, a, unit, symbol, e, g, km, cm, constitutes, a, new, inseparable, unit, symbol, this, new, symbol, can, be, raised, to, a, positive, or, negative, power, it, can, also, be, combined, with, other, unit, symbols, to, form, compound, unit, symbols, 143, for, example, g, cm, 3, is, an, si, unit, of, density, where, cm, 3, is, to, be, interpreted, as, cm, 3, prefixes, are, added, to, unit, names, to, produce, multiples, and, submultiples, of, the, original, unit, all, of, these, are, integer, powers, of, ten, and, above, a, hundred, or, below, a, hundredth, all, are, integer, powers, of, a, thousand, for, example, kilo, denotes, a, multiple, of, a, thousand, and, milli, denotes, a, multiple, of, a, thousandth, so, there, are, one, thousand, millimetres, to, the, metre, and, one, thousand, metres, to, the, kilometre, the, prefixes, are, never, combined, so, for, example, a, millionth, of, a, metre, is, a, micrometre, not, a, millimillimetre, multiples, of, the, kilogram, are, named, as, if, the, gram, were, the, base, unit, so, a, millionth, of, a, kilogram, is, a, milligram, not, a, microkilogram, 122, 14, the, bipm, specifies, 24, prefixes, for, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, base, units, and, the, derived, units, formed, as, the, product, of, powers, of, the, base, units, with, a, numerical, factor, of, one, form, a, coherent, system, of, units, every, physical, quantity, has, exactly, one, coherent, si, unit, for, example, 1, m, s, 1, m, 1, s, is, the, coherent, derived, unit, for, velocity, 139, with, the, exception, of, the, kilogram, for, which, the, prefix, kilo, is, required, for, a, coherent, unit, when, prefixes, are, used, with, the, coherent, si, units, the, resulting, units, are, no, longer, coherent, because, the, prefix, introduces, a, numerical, factor, other, than, one, 137, for, example, the, metre, kilometre, centimetre, nanometre, etc, are, all, si, units, of, length, though, only, the, metre, is, a, coherent, si, unit, the, complete, set, of, si, units, consists, of, both, the, coherent, set, and, the, multiples, and, sub, multiples, of, coherent, units, formed, by, using, the, si, prefixes, 138, the, kilogram, is, the, only, coherent, si, unit, whose, name, and, symbol, include, a, prefix, for, historical, reasons, the, names, and, symbols, for, multiples, and, sub, multiples, of, the, unit, of, mass, are, formed, as, if, the, gram, were, the, base, unit, prefix, names, and, symbols, are, attached, to, the, unit, name, gram, and, the, unit, symbol, g, respectively, for, example, 10, 6, kg, is, written, milligram, and, mg, not, microkilogram, and, kg, 144, several, different, quantities, may, share, the, same, coherent, si, unit, for, example, the, joule, per, kelvin, symbol, j, k, is, the, coherent, si, unit, for, two, distinct, quantities, heat, capacity, and, entropy, another, example, is, the, ampere, which, is, the, coherent, si, unit, for, both, electric, current, and, magnetomotive, force, this, illustrates, why, it, is, important, not, to, use, the, unit, alone, to, specify, the, quantity, as, the, si, brochure, states, 140, this, applies, not, only, to, technical, texts, but, also, for, example, to, measuring, instruments, i, e, the, instrument, read, out, needs, to, indicate, both, the, unit, and, the, quantity, measured, furthermore, the, same, coherent, si, unit, may, be, a, base, unit, in, one, context, but, a, coherent, derived, unit, in, another, for, example, the, ampere, is, a, base, unit, when, it, is, a, unit, of, electric, current, but, a, coherent, derived, unit, when, it, is, a, unit, of, magnetomotive, force, 140, according, to, the, si, brochure, 148, unit, names, should, be, treated, as, common, nouns, of, the, context, language, this, means, that, they, should, be, typeset, in, the, same, character, set, as, other, common, nouns, e, g, latin, alphabet, in, english, cyrillic, script, in, russian, etc, following, the, usual, grammatical, and, orthographical, rules, of, the, context, language, for, example, in, english, and, french, even, when, the, unit, is, named, after, a, person, and, its, symbol, begins, with, a, capital, letter, the, unit, name, in, running, text, should, start, with, a, lowercase, letter, e, g, newton, hertz, pascal, and, is, capitalised, only, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, headings, and, publication, titles, as, a, nontrivial, application, of, this, rule, the, si, brochure, notes, 148, that, the, name, of, the, unit, with, the, symbol, c, is, correctly, spelled, as, degree, celsius, the, first, letter, of, the, name, of, the, unit, d, is, in, lowercase, while, the, modifier, celsius, is, capitalised, because, it, is, a, proper, name, 148, the, english, spelling, and, even, names, for, certain, si, units, and, metric, prefixes, depend, on, the, variety, of, english, used, us, english, uses, the, spelling, deka, meter, and, liter, and, international, english, uses, deca, metre, and, litre, the, name, of, the, unit, whose, symbol, is, t, and, which, is, defined, according, to, 1, t, 10, 3, kg, is, metric, ton, in, us, english, and, tonne, in, international, english, iii, symbols, of, si, units, are, intended, to, be, unique, and, universal, independent, of, the, context, language, 130, 135, the, si, brochure, has, specific, rules, for, writing, them, 130, 135, in, addition, the, si, brochure, provides, style, conventions, for, among, other, aspects, of, displaying, quantities, units, the, quantity, symbols, formatting, of, numbers, and, the, decimal, marker, expressing, measurement, uncertainty, multiplication, and, division, of, quantity, symbols, and, the, use, of, pure, numbers, and, various, angles, 147, in, the, united, states, the, guideline, produced, by, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, 37, clarifies, language, specific, details, for, american, english, that, were, left, unclear, by, the, si, brochure, but, is, otherwise, identical, to, the, si, brochure, for, example, since, 1979, the, litre, may, exceptionally, be, written, using, either, an, uppercase, l, or, a, lowercase, l, a, decision, prompted, by, the, similarity, of, the, lowercase, letter, l, to, the, numeral, 1, especially, with, certain, typefaces, or, english, style, handwriting, the, american, nist, recommends, that, within, the, united, states, l, be, used, rather, than, l, metrologists, carefully, distinguish, between, the, definition, of, a, unit, and, its, realisation, the, si, units, are, defined, by, declaring, that, seven, defining, constants, 125, 129, have, certain, exact, numerical, values, when, expressed, in, terms, of, their, si, units, the, realisation, of, the, definition, of, a, unit, is, the, procedure, by, which, the, definition, may, be, used, to, establish, the, value, and, associated, uncertainty, of, a, quantity, of, the, same, kind, as, the, unit, 135, for, each, base, unit, the, bipm, publishes, a, mises, en, pratique, french, for, putting, into, practice, implementation, describing, the, current, best, practical, realisations, of, the, unit, the, separation, of, the, defining, constants, from, the, definitions, of, units, means, that, improved, measurements, can, be, developed, leading, to, changes, in, the, mises, en, pratique, as, science, and, technology, develop, without, having, to, revise, the, definitions, the, published, mise, en, pratique, is, not, the, only, way, in, which, a, base, unit, can, be, determined, the, si, brochure, states, that, any, method, consistent, with, the, laws, of, physics, could, be, used, to, realise, any, si, unit, 111, various, consultative, committees, of, the, cipm, decided, in, 2016, that, more, than, one, mise, en, pratique, would, be, developed, for, determining, the, value, of, each, unit, these, methods, include, the, following, the, international, system, of, units, or, si, 123, is, a, decimal, and, metric, system, of, units, established, in, 1960, and, periodically, updated, since, then, the, si, has, an, official, status, in, most, countries, including, the, united, states, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, although, these, three, countries, are, among, the, handful, of, nations, that, to, various, degrees, also, continue, to, use, their, customary, systems, nevertheless, with, this, nearly, universal, level, of, acceptance, the, si, has, been, used, around, the, world, as, the, preferred, system, of, units, the, basic, language, for, science, technology, industry, and, trade, 123, 126, the, only, other, types, of, measurement, system, that, still, have, widespread, use, across, the, world, are, the, imperial, and, us, customary, measurement, systems, the, international, yard, and, pound, are, defined, in, terms, of, the, si, the, quantities, and, equations, that, provide, the, context, in, which, the, si, units, are, defined, are, now, referred, to, as, the, international, system, of, quantities, isq, the, isq, is, based, on, the, quantities, underlying, each, of, the, seven, base, units, of, the, si, other, quantities, such, as, area, pressure, and, electrical, resistance, are, derived, from, these, base, quantities, by, clear, non, contradictory, equations, the, isq, defines, the, quantities, that, are, measured, with, the, si, units, the, isq, is, formalised, in, part, in, the, international, standard, iso, iec, 80000, which, was, completed, in, 2009, with, the, publication, of, iso, 80000, 1, and, has, largely, been, revised, in, 2019, 2020, the, si, is, regulated, and, continually, developed, by, three, international, organisations, that, were, established, in, 1875, under, the, terms, of, the, metre, convention, they, are, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, and, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, all, the, decisions, and, recommendations, concerning, units, are, collected, in, a, brochure, called, the, international, system, of, units, si, which, is, published, in, french, and, english, by, the, bipm, and, periodically, updated, the, writing, and, maintenance, of, the, brochure, is, carried, out, by, one, of, the, committees, of, the, cipm, the, definitions, of, the, terms, quantity, unit, dimension, etc, that, are, used, in, the, si, brochure, are, those, given, in, the, international, vocabulary, of, metrology, the, brochure, leaves, some, scope, for, local, variations, particularly, regarding, unit, names, and, terms, in, different, languages, for, example, the, united, states, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, has, produced, a, version, of, the, cgpm, document, nist, sp, 330, which, clarifies, usage, for, english, language, publications, that, use, american, english, the, concept, of, a, system, of, units, emerged, a, hundred, years, before, the, si, in, the, 1860s, james, clerk, maxwell, william, thomson, later, lord, kelvin, and, others, working, under, the, auspices, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, building, on, previous, work, of, carl, gauss, developed, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, of, units, or, cgs, system, in, 1874, the, systems, formalised, the, concept, of, a, collection, of, related, units, called, a, coherent, system, of, units, in, a, coherent, system, base, units, combine, to, define, derived, units, without, extra, factors, 2, for, example, using, meters, per, second, is, coherent, in, a, system, that, uses, meter, for, length, and, seconds, for, time, but, kilometre, per, hour, is, not, coherent, the, principle, of, coherence, was, successfully, used, to, define, a, number, of, units, of, measure, based, on, the, cgs, including, the, erg, for, energy, the, dyne, for, force, the, barye, for, pressure, the, poise, for, dynamic, viscosity, and, the, stokes, for, kinematic, viscosity, a, french, inspired, initiative, for, international, cooperation, in, metrology, led, to, the, signing, in, 1875, of, the, metre, convention, also, called, treaty, of, the, metre, by, 17, nations, 353, 354, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, french, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, cgpm, which, was, established, by, the, metre, convention, brought, together, many, international, organisations, to, establish, the, definitions, and, standards, of, a, new, system, and, to, standardise, the, rules, for, writing, and, presenting, measurements, 37, initially, the, convention, only, covered, standards, for, the, metre, and, the, kilogram, this, became, the, foundation, of, the, mks, system, of, units, 2, at, the, close, of, the, 19th, century, three, different, systems, of, units, of, measure, existed, for, electrical, measurements, a, cgs, based, system, for, electrostatic, units, also, known, as, the, gaussian, or, esu, system, a, cgs, based, system, for, electromechanical, units, emu, and, an, international, system, based, on, units, defined, by, the, metre, convention, for, electrical, distribution, systems, attempts, to, resolve, the, electrical, units, in, terms, of, length, mass, and, time, using, dimensional, analysis, was, beset, with, difficulties, the, dimensions, depended, on, whether, one, used, the, esu, or, emu, systems, this, anomaly, was, resolved, in, 1901, when, giovanni, giorgi, published, a, paper, in, which, he, advocated, using, a, fourth, base, unit, alongside, the, existing, three, base, units, the, fourth, unit, could, be, chosen, to, be, electric, current, voltage, or, electrical, resistance, electric, current, with, named, unit, ampere, was, chosen, as, the, base, unit, and, the, other, electrical, quantities, derived, from, it, according, to, the, laws, of, physics, when, combined, with, the, mks, the, new, system, known, as, mksa, was, approved, in, 1946, in, 1948, the, 9th, cgpm, commissioned, a, study, to, assess, the, measurement, needs, of, the, scientific, technical, and, educational, communities, and, to, make, recommendations, for, a, single, practical, system, of, units, of, measurement, suitable, for, adoption, by, all, countries, adhering, to, the, metre, convention, this, working, document, was, practical, system, of, units, of, measurement, based, on, this, study, the, 10th, cgpm, in, 1954, defined, an, international, system, derived, six, base, units, the, metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree, kelvin, and, candela, the, 9th, cgpm, also, approved, the, first, formal, recommendation, for, the, writing, of, symbols, in, the, metric, system, when, the, basis, of, the, rules, as, they, are, now, known, was, laid, down, these, rules, were, subsequently, extended, and, now, cover, unit, symbols, and, names, prefix, symbols, and, names, how, quantity, symbols, should, be, written, and, used, and, how, the, values, of, quantities, should, be, expressed, 104, 130, the, 10th, cgpm, in, 1954, resolved, to, create, an, international, system, of, units, 41, and, in, 1960, the, 11th, cgpm, adopted, the, international, system, of, units, abbreviated, si, from, the, french, name, le, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, which, included, a, specification, for, units, of, measurement, 110, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, has, described, si, as, the, modern, form, of, metric, system, 95, in, 1971, the, mole, became, the, seventh, base, unit, of, the, si, 2, after, the, metre, was, redefined, in, 1960, the, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, ipk, was, the, only, physical, artefact, upon, which, base, units, directly, the, kilogram, and, indirectly, the, ampere, mole, and, candela, depended, for, their, definition, making, these, units, subject, to, periodic, comparisons, of, national, standard, kilograms, with, the, ipk, during, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, periodic, verification, of, national, prototypes, of, the, kilogram, a, significant, divergence, had, occurred, between, the, mass, of, the, ipk, and, all, of, its, official, copies, stored, around, the, world, the, copies, had, all, noticeably, increased, in, mass, with, respect, to, the, ipk, during, extraordinary, verifications, carried, out, in, 2014, preparatory, to, redefinition, of, metric, standards, continuing, divergence, was, not, confirmed, nonetheless, the, residual, and, irreducible, instability, of, a, physical, ipk, undermined, the, reliability, of, the, entire, metric, system, to, precision, measurement, from, small, atomic, to, large, astrophysical, scales, by, avoiding, the, use, of, an, artefact, to, define, units, all, issues, with, the, loss, damage, and, change, of, the, artefact, are, avoided, 125, a, proposal, was, made, that, the, new, definitions, were, adopted, at, the, 26th, cgpm, on, 16, november, 2018, and, came, into, effect, on, 20, may, 2019, the, change, was, adopted, by, the, european, union, through, directive, eu, 2019, 1258, prior, to, its, redefinition, in, 2019, the, si, was, defined, through, the, seven, base, units, from, which, the, derived, units, were, constructed, as, products, of, powers, of, the, base, units, after, the, redefinition, the, si, is, defined, by, fixing, the, numerical, values, of, seven, defining, constants, this, has, the, effect, that, the, distinction, between, the, base, units, and, derived, units, is, in, principle, not, needed, since, all, units, base, as, well, as, derived, may, be, constructed, directly, from, the, defining, constants, nevertheless, the, distinction, is, retained, because, it, is, useful, and, historically, well, established, and, also, because, the, iso, iec, 80000, series, of, standards, which, define, the, international, system, of, quantities, isq, specifies, base, and, derived, quantities, that, necessarily, have, the, corresponding, si, units, 129, many, non, si, units, continue, to, be, used, in, the, scientific, technical, and, commercial, literature, some, units, are, deeply, embedded, in, history, and, culture, and, their, use, has, not, been, entirely, replaced, by, their, si, alternatives, the, cipm, recognised, and, acknowledged, such, traditions, by, compiling, a, list, of, non, si, units, accepted, for, use, with, si, including, the, hour, minute, degree, of, angle, litre, and, decibel, although, the, term, metric, system, is, often, used, as, an, informal, alternative, name, for, the, international, system, of, units, other, metric, systems, exist, some, of, which, were, in, widespread, use, in, the, past, or, are, even, still, used, in, particular, areas, there, are, also, individual, metric, units, such, as, the, sverdrup, and, the, darcy, that, exist, outside, of, any, system, of, units, most, of, the, units, of, the, other, metric, systems, are, not, recognised, by, the, si, sometimes, si, unit, name, variations, are, introduced, mixing, information, about, the, corresponding, physical, quantity, or, the, conditions, of, its, measurement, however, this, practice, is, unacceptable, with, the, si, unacceptability, of, mixing, information, with, units, when, one, gives, the, value, of, a, quantity, any, information, concerning, the, quantity, or, its, conditions, of, measurement, must, be, presented, in, such, a, way, as, not, to, be, associated, with, the, unit, instances, include, watt, peak, and, watt, rms, geopotential, metre, and, vertical, metre, standard, cubic, metre, atomic, second, ephemeris, second, and,
