an, electrical, network, is, an, interconnection, of, electrical, components, e, g, batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches, transistors, or, a, model, of, such, an, interconnection, consisting, of, electrical, elements, e, g, voltage, sources, current, sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances, an, electrical, circuit, is, a, network, consisting, of, a, closed, loop, giving, a, return, path, for, the, current, thus, all, circuits, are, networks, but, not, all, networks, are, circuits, although, networks, without, a, closed, loop, are, often, imprecisely, referred, to, as, circuits, linear, electrical, networks, a, special, type, consisting, only, of, sources, voltage, or, current, linear, lumped, elements, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and, linear, distributed, elements, transmission, lines, have, the, property, that, signals, are, linearly, superimposable, they, are, thus, more, easily, analyzed, using, powerful, frequency, domain, methods, such, as, laplace, transforms, to, determine, dc, response, ac, response, and, transient, response, a, resistive, network, is, a, network, containing, only, resistors, and, ideal, current, and, voltage, sources, analysis, of, resistive, networks, is, less, complicated, than, analysis, of, networks, containing, capacitors, and, inductors, if, the, sources, are, constant, dc, sources, the, result, is, a, dc, network, the, effective, resistance, and, current, distribution, properties, of, arbitrary, resistor, networks, can, be, modeled, in, terms, of, their, graph, measures, and, geometrical, properties, a, network, that, contains, active, electronic, components, is, known, as, an, electronic, circuit, such, networks, are, generally, nonlinear, and, require, more, complex, design, and, analysis, tools, an, active, network, contains, at, least, one, voltage, source, or, current, source, that, can, supply, energy, to, the, network, indefinitely, a, passive, network, does, not, contain, an, active, source, an, active, network, contains, one, or, more, sources, of, electromotive, force, practical, examples, of, such, sources, include, a, battery, or, a, generator, active, elements, can, inject, power, to, the, circuit, provide, power, gain, and, control, the, current, flow, within, the, circuit, passive, networks, do, not, contain, any, sources, of, electromotive, force, they, consist, of, passive, elements, like, resistors, and, capacitors, a, network, is, linear, if, its, signals, obey, the, principle, of, superposition, otherwise, it, is, non, linear, passive, networks, are, generally, taken, to, be, linear, but, there, are, exceptions, for, instance, an, inductor, with, an, iron, core, can, be, driven, into, saturation, if, driven, with, a, large, enough, current, in, this, region, the, behaviour, of, the, inductor, is, very, non, linear, discrete, passive, components, resistors, capacitors, and, inductors, are, called, lumped, elements, because, all, of, their, respectively, resistance, capacitance, and, inductance, is, assumed, to, be, located, lumped, at, one, place, this, design, philosophy, is, called, the, lumped, element, model, and, networks, so, designed, are, called, lumped, element, circuits, this, is, the, conventional, approach, to, circuit, design, at, high, enough, frequencies, or, for, long, enough, circuits, such, as, power, transmission, lines, the, lumped, assumption, no, longer, holds, because, there, is, a, significant, fraction, of, a, wavelength, across, the, component, dimensions, a, new, design, model, is, needed, for, such, cases, called, the, distributed, element, model, networks, designed, to, this, model, are, called, distributed, element, circuits, a, distributed, element, circuit, that, includes, some, lumped, components, is, called, a, semi, lumped, design, an, example, of, a, semi, lumped, circuit, is, the, combline, filter, sources, can, be, classified, as, independent, sources, and, dependent, sources, an, ideal, independent, source, maintains, the, same, voltage, or, current, regardless, of, the, other, elements, present, in, the, circuit, its, value, is, either, constant, dc, or, sinusoidal, ac, the, strength, of, voltage, or, current, is, not, changed, by, any, variation, in, the, connected, network, dependent, sources, depend, upon, a, particular, element, of, the, circuit, for, delivering, the, power, or, voltage, or, current, depending, upon, the, type, of, source, it, is, a, number, of, electrical, laws, apply, to, all, linear, resistive, networks, these, include, applying, these, laws, results, in, a, set, of, simultaneous, equations, that, can, be, solved, either, algebraically, or, numerically, the, laws, can, generally, be, extended, to, networks, containing, reactances, they, cannot, be, used, in, networks, that, contain, nonlinear, or, time, varying, components, to, design, any, electrical, circuit, either, analog, or, digital, electrical, engineers, need, to, be, able, to, predict, the, voltages, and, currents, at, all, places, within, the, circuit, simple, linear, circuits, can, be, analyzed, by, hand, using, complex, number, theory, in, more, complex, cases, the, circuit, may, be, analyzed, with, specialized, computer, programs, or, estimation, techniques, such, as, the, piecewise, linear, model, circuit, simulation, software, such, as, hspice, an, analog, circuit, simulator, and, languages, such, as, vhdl, ams, and, verilog, ams, allow, engineers, to, design, circuits, without, the, time, cost, and, risk, of, error, involved, in, building, circuit, prototypes, more, complex, circuits, can, be, analyzed, numerically, with, software, such, as, spice, or, gnucap, or, symbolically, using, software, such, as, sapwin, when, faced, with, a, new, circuit, the, software, first, tries, to, find, a, steady, state, solution, that, is, one, where, all, nodes, conform, to, kirchhoff, s, current, law, and, the, voltages, across, and, through, each, element, of, the, circuit, conform, to, the, voltage, current, equations, governing, that, element, once, the, steady, state, solution, is, found, the, operating, points, of, each, element, in, the, circuit, are, known, for, a, small, signal, analysis, every, non, linear, element, can, be, linearized, around, its, operation, point, to, obtain, the, small, signal, estimate, of, the, voltages, and, currents, this, is, an, application, of, ohm, s, law, the, resulting, linear, circuit, matrix, can, be, solved, with, gaussian, elimination, software, such, as, the, plecs, interface, to, simulink, uses, piecewise, linear, approximation, of, the, equations, governing, the, elements, of, a, circuit, the, circuit, is, treated, as, a, completely, linear, network, of, ideal, diodes, every, time, a, diode, switches, from, on, to, off, or, vice, versa, the, configuration, of, the, linear, network, changes, adding, more, detail, to, the, approximation, of, equations, increases, the, accuracy, of, the, simulation, but, also, increases, its, running, time
