in, physics, gravity, from, latin, gravitas, weight, is, a, fundamental, interaction, primarily, observed, as, mutual, attraction, between, all, things, that, have, mass, gravity, is, by, far, the, weakest, of, the, four, fundamental, interactions, approximately, 10, 38, times, weaker, than, the, strong, interaction, 10, 36, times, weaker, than, the, electromagnetic, force, and, 10, 29, times, weaker, than, the, weak, interaction, as, a, result, it, has, no, significant, influence, at, the, level, of, subatomic, particles, however, gravity, is, the, most, significant, interaction, between, objects, at, the, macroscopic, scale, and, it, determines, the, motion, of, planets, stars, galaxies, and, even, light, on, earth, gravity, gives, weight, to, physical, objects, and, the, moon, s, gravity, is, responsible, for, sublunar, tides, in, the, oceans, the, corresponding, antipodal, tide, is, caused, by, the, inertia, of, the, earth, and, moon, orbiting, one, another, gravity, also, has, many, important, biological, functions, helping, to, guide, the, growth, of, plants, through, the, process, of, gravitropism, and, influencing, the, circulation, of, fluids, in, multicellular, organisms, the, gravitational, attraction, between, the, original, gaseous, matter, in, the, universe, caused, it, to, coalesce, and, form, stars, which, eventually, condensed, into, galaxies, so, gravity, is, responsible, for, many, of, the, large, scale, structures, in, the, universe, gravity, has, an, infinite, range, although, its, effects, become, weaker, as, objects, get, farther, away, gravity, is, most, accurately, described, by, the, general, theory, of, relativity, proposed, by, albert, einstein, in, 1915, which, describes, gravity, not, as, a, force, but, as, the, curvature, of, spacetime, caused, by, the, uneven, distribution, of, mass, and, causing, masses, to, move, along, geodesic, lines, the, most, extreme, example, of, this, curvature, of, spacetime, is, a, black, hole, from, which, nothing, not, even, light, can, escape, once, past, the, black, hole, s, event, horizon, however, for, most, applications, gravity, is, well, approximated, by, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, which, describes, gravity, as, a, force, causing, any, two, bodies, to, be, attracted, toward, each, other, with, magnitude, proportional, to, the, product, of, their, masses, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, current, models, of, particle, physics, imply, that, the, earliest, instance, of, gravity, in, the, universe, possibly, in, the, form, of, quantum, gravity, supergravity, or, a, gravitational, singularity, along, with, ordinary, space, and, time, developed, during, the, planck, epoch, up, to, 10, 43, seconds, after, the, birth, of, the, universe, possibly, from, a, primeval, state, such, as, a, false, vacuum, quantum, vacuum, or, virtual, particle, in, a, currently, unknown, manner, scientists, are, currently, working, to, develop, a, theory, of, gravity, consistent, with, quantum, mechanics, a, quantum, gravity, theory, which, would, allow, gravity, to, be, united, in, a, common, mathematical, framework, a, theory, of, everything, with, the, other, three, fundamental, interactions, of, physics, gravitation, also, known, as, gravitational, attraction, is, the, mutual, attraction, between, all, masses, in, the, universe, gravity, is, the, gravitational, attraction, at, the, surface, of, a, planet, or, other, celestial, body, gravity, may, also, include, in, addition, to, gravitation, the, centrifugal, force, resulting, from, the, planet, s, rotation, see, earth, s, gravity, the, nature, and, mechanism, of, gravity, were, explored, by, a, wide, range, of, ancient, scholars, in, greece, aristotle, believed, that, objects, fell, towards, the, earth, because, the, earth, was, the, center, of, the, universe, and, attracted, all, of, the, mass, in, the, universe, towards, it, he, also, thought, that, the, speed, of, a, falling, object, should, increase, with, its, weight, a, conclusion, that, was, later, shown, to, be, false, while, aristotle, s, view, was, widely, accepted, throughout, ancient, greece, there, were, other, thinkers, such, as, plutarch, who, correctly, predicted, that, the, attraction, of, gravity, was, not, unique, to, the, earth, although, he, did, not, understand, gravity, as, a, force, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, archimedes, discovered, the, center, of, gravity, of, a, triangle, he, postulated, that, if, two, equal, weights, did, not, have, the, same, center, of, gravity, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, two, weights, together, would, be, in, the, middle, of, the, line, that, joins, their, centers, of, gravity, two, centuries, later, the, roman, engineer, and, architect, vitruvius, contended, in, his, de, architectura, that, gravity, is, not, dependent, on, a, substance, s, weight, but, rather, on, its, nature, in, the, 6th, century, ce, the, byzantine, alexandrian, scholar, john, philoponus, proposed, the, theory, of, impetus, which, modifies, aristotle, s, theory, that, continuation, of, motion, depends, on, continued, action, of, a, force, by, incorporating, a, causative, force, that, diminishes, over, time, in, the, seventh, century, ce, the, indian, mathematician, and, astronomer, brahmagupta, proposed, the, idea, that, gravity, is, an, attractive, force, that, draws, objects, to, the, earth, and, used, the, term, gurutv, kar, a, to, describe, it, in, the, ancient, middle, east, gravity, was, a, topic, of, fierce, debate, the, persian, intellectual, al, biruni, believed, that, the, force, of, gravity, was, not, unique, to, the, earth, and, he, correctly, assumed, that, other, heavenly, bodies, should, exert, a, gravitational, attraction, as, well, in, contrast, al, khazini, held, the, same, position, as, aristotle, that, all, matter, in, the, universe, is, attracted, to, the, center, of, the, earth, in, the, mid, 16th, century, various, european, scientists, experimentally, disproved, the, aristotelian, notion, that, heavier, objects, fall, at, a, faster, rate, in, particular, the, spanish, dominican, priest, domingo, de, soto, wrote, in, 1551, that, bodies, in, free, fall, uniformly, accelerate, de, soto, may, have, been, influenced, by, earlier, experiments, conducted, by, other, dominican, priests, in, italy, including, those, by, benedetto, varchi, francesco, beato, luca, ghini, and, giovan, bellaso, which, contradicted, aristotle, s, teachings, on, the, fall, of, bodies, the, mid, 16th, century, italian, physicist, giambattista, benedetti, published, papers, claiming, that, due, to, specific, gravity, objects, made, of, the, same, material, but, with, different, masses, would, fall, at, the, same, speed, with, the, 1586, delft, tower, experiment, the, flemish, physicist, simon, stevin, observed, that, two, cannonballs, of, differing, sizes, and, weights, fell, at, the, same, rate, when, dropped, from, a, tower, in, the, late, 16th, century, galileo, galilei, s, careful, measurements, of, balls, rolling, down, inclines, allowed, him, to, firmly, establish, that, gravitational, acceleration, is, the, same, for, all, objects, galileo, postulated, that, air, resistance, is, the, reason, that, objects, with, a, low, density, and, high, surface, area, fall, more, slowly, in, an, atmosphere, in, 1604, galileo, correctly, hypothesized, that, the, distance, of, a, falling, object, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, time, elapsed, this, was, later, confirmed, by, italian, scientists, jesuits, grimaldi, and, riccioli, between, 1640, and, 1650, they, also, calculated, the, magnitude, of, the, earth, s, gravity, by, measuring, the, oscillations, of, a, pendulum, in, 1657, robert, hooke, published, his, micrographia, in, which, he, hypothesised, that, the, moon, must, have, its, own, gravity, in, 1666, he, added, two, further, principles, that, all, bodies, move, in, straight, lines, until, deflected, by, some, force, and, that, the, attractive, force, is, stronger, for, closer, bodies, in, a, communication, to, the, royal, society, in, 1666, hooke, wrote, i, will, explain, a, system, of, the, world, very, different, from, any, yet, received, it, is, founded, on, the, following, positions, 1, that, all, the, heavenly, bodies, have, not, only, a, gravitation, of, their, parts, to, their, own, proper, centre, but, that, they, also, mutually, attract, each, other, within, their, spheres, of, action, 2, that, all, bodies, having, a, simple, motion, will, continue, to, move, in, a, straight, line, unless, continually, deflected, from, it, by, some, extraneous, force, causing, them, to, describe, a, circle, an, ellipse, or, some, other, curve, 3, that, this, attraction, is, so, much, the, greater, as, the, bodies, are, nearer, as, to, the, proportion, in, which, those, forces, diminish, by, an, increase, of, distance, i, own, i, have, not, discovered, it, hooke, s, 1674, gresham, lecture, an, attempt, to, prove, the, annual, motion, of, the, earth, explained, that, gravitation, applied, to, all, celestial, bodies, in, 1684, newton, sent, a, manuscript, to, edmond, halley, titled, de, motu, corporum, in, gyrum, on, the, motion, of, bodies, in, an, orbit, which, provided, a, physical, justification, for, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, halley, was, impressed, by, the, manuscript, and, urged, newton, to, expand, on, it, and, a, few, years, later, newton, published, a, groundbreaking, book, called, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, in, this, book, newton, described, gravitation, as, a, universal, force, and, claimed, that, the, forces, which, keep, the, planets, in, their, orbs, must, reciprocally, as, the, squares, of, their, distances, from, the, centers, about, which, they, revolve, this, statement, was, later, condensed, into, the, following, inverse, square, law, f, g, m, 1, m, 2, r, 2, displaystyle, f, g, frac, m, 1, m, 2, r, 2, where, f, is, the, force, m, 1, and, m, 2, are, the, masses, of, the, objects, interacting, r, is, the, distance, between, the, centers, of, the, masses, and, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, 6, 674, 10, 11, m, 3, kg, 1, s, 2, newton, s, principia, was, well, received, by, the, scientific, community, and, his, law, of, gravitation, quickly, spread, across, the, european, world, more, than, a, century, later, in, 1821, his, theory, of, gravitation, rose, to, even, greater, prominence, when, it, was, used, to, predict, the, existence, of, neptune, in, that, year, the, french, astronomer, alexis, bouvard, used, this, theory, to, create, a, table, modeling, the, orbit, of, uranus, which, was, shown, to, differ, significantly, from, the, planet, s, actual, trajectory, in, order, to, explain, this, discrepancy, many, astronomers, speculated, that, there, might, be, a, large, object, beyond, the, orbit, of, uranus, which, was, disrupting, its, orbit, in, 1846, the, astronomers, john, couch, adams, and, urbain, le, verrier, independently, used, newton, s, law, to, predict, neptune, s, location, in, the, night, sky, and, the, planet, was, discovered, there, within, a, day, eventually, astronomers, noticed, an, eccentricity, in, the, orbit, of, the, planet, mercury, which, could, not, be, explained, by, newton, s, theory, the, perihelion, of, the, orbit, was, increasing, by, about, 42, 98, arcseconds, per, century, the, most, obvious, explanation, for, this, discrepancy, was, an, as, yet, undiscovered, celestial, body, such, as, a, planet, orbiting, the, sun, even, closer, than, mercury, but, all, efforts, to, find, such, a, body, turned, out, to, be, fruitless, in, 1915, albert, einstein, developed, a, theory, of, general, relativity, which, was, able, to, accurately, model, mercury, s, orbit, in, general, relativity, the, effects, of, gravitation, are, ascribed, to, spacetime, curvature, instead, of, a, force, einstein, began, to, toy, with, this, idea, in, the, form, of, the, equivalence, principle, a, discovery, which, he, later, described, as, the, happiest, thought, of, my, life, in, this, theory, free, fall, is, considered, to, be, equivalent, to, inertial, motion, meaning, that, free, falling, inertial, objects, are, accelerated, relative, to, non, inertial, observers, on, the, ground, in, contrast, to, newtonian, physics, einstein, believed, that, it, was, possible, for, this, acceleration, to, occur, without, any, force, being, applied, to, the, object, einstein, proposed, that, spacetime, is, curved, by, matter, and, that, free, falling, objects, are, moving, along, locally, straight, paths, in, curved, spacetime, these, straight, paths, are, called, geodesics, as, in, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, einstein, believed, that, a, force, applied, to, an, object, would, cause, it, to, deviate, from, a, geodesic, for, instance, people, standing, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, are, prevented, from, following, a, geodesic, path, because, the, mechanical, resistance, of, the, earth, exerts, an, upward, force, on, them, this, explains, why, moving, along, the, geodesics, in, spacetime, is, considered, inertial, einstein, s, description, of, gravity, was, quickly, accepted, by, the, majority, of, physicists, as, it, was, able, to, explain, a, wide, variety, of, previously, baffling, experimental, results, in, the, coming, years, a, wide, range, of, experiments, provided, additional, support, for, the, idea, of, general, relativity, p, 1, 9, today, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, is, used, for, all, gravitational, calculations, where, absolute, precision, is, desired, although, newton, s, inverse, square, law, is, accurate, enough, for, virtually, all, ordinary, calculations, p, 79, in, modern, physics, general, relativity, remains, the, framework, for, the, understanding, of, gravity, physicists, continue, to, work, to, find, solutions, to, the, einstein, field, equations, that, form, the, basis, of, general, relativity, and, continue, to, test, the, theory, finding, excellent, agreement, in, all, cases, p, 9, the, einstein, field, equations, are, a, system, of, 10, partial, differential, equations, which, describe, how, matter, affects, the, curvature, of, spacetime, the, system, is, often, expressed, in, the, form, g, g, t, displaystyle, g, mu, nu, lambda, g, mu, nu, kappa, t, mu, nu, where, g, is, the, einstein, tensor, g, is, the, metric, tensor, t, is, the, stress, energy, tensor, is, the, cosmological, constant, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, and, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, the, constant, 8, g, c, 4, displaystyle, kappa, frac, 8, pi, g, c, 4, is, referred, to, as, the, einstein, gravitational, constant, a, major, area, of, research, is, the, discovery, of, exact, solutions, to, the, einstein, field, equations, solving, these, equations, amounts, to, calculating, a, precise, value, for, the, metric, tensor, which, defines, the, curvature, and, geometry, of, spacetime, under, certain, physical, conditions, there, is, no, formal, definition, for, what, constitutes, such, solutions, but, most, scientists, agree, that, they, should, be, expressable, using, elementary, functions, or, linear, differential, equations, some, of, the, most, notable, solutions, of, the, equations, include, today, there, remain, many, important, situations, in, which, the, einstein, field, equations, have, not, been, solved, chief, among, these, is, the, two, body, problem, which, concerns, the, geometry, of, spacetime, around, two, mutually, interacting, massive, objects, such, as, the, sun, and, the, earth, or, the, two, stars, in, a, binary, star, system, the, situation, gets, even, more, complicated, when, considering, the, interactions, of, three, or, more, massive, bodies, the, n, body, problem, and, some, scientists, suspect, that, the, einstein, field, equations, will, never, be, solved, in, this, context, however, it, is, still, possible, to, construct, an, approximate, solution, to, the, field, equations, in, the, n, body, problem, by, using, the, technique, of, post, newtonian, expansion, in, general, the, extreme, nonlinearity, of, the, einstein, field, equations, makes, it, difficult, to, solve, them, in, all, but, the, most, specific, cases, despite, its, success, in, predicting, the, effects, of, gravity, at, large, scales, general, relativity, is, ultimately, incompatible, with, quantum, mechanics, this, is, because, general, relativity, describes, gravity, as, a, smooth, continuous, distortion, of, spacetime, while, quantum, mechanics, holds, that, all, forces, arise, from, the, exchange, of, discrete, particles, known, as, quanta, this, contradiction, is, especially, vexing, to, physicists, because, the, other, three, fundamental, forces, strong, force, weak, force, and, electromagnetism, were, reconciled, with, a, quantum, framework, decades, ago, as, a, result, modern, researchers, have, begun, to, search, for, a, theory, that, could, unite, both, gravity, and, quantum, mechanics, under, a, more, general, framework, one, path, is, to, describe, gravity, in, the, framework, of, quantum, field, theory, which, has, been, successful, to, accurately, describe, the, other, fundamental, interactions, the, electromagnetic, force, arises, from, an, exchange, of, virtual, photons, where, the, qft, description, of, gravity, is, that, there, is, an, exchange, of, virtual, gravitons, this, description, reproduces, general, relativity, in, the, classical, limit, however, this, approach, fails, at, short, distances, of, the, order, of, the, planck, length, where, a, more, complete, theory, of, quantum, gravity, or, a, new, approach, to, quantum, mechanics, is, required, testing, the, predictions, of, general, relativity, has, historically, been, difficult, because, they, are, almost, identical, to, the, predictions, of, newtonian, gravity, for, small, energies, and, masses, still, since, its, development, an, ongoing, series, of, experimental, results, have, provided, support, for, the, theory, every, planetary, body, including, the, earth, is, surrounded, by, its, own, gravitational, field, which, can, be, conceptualized, with, newtonian, physics, as, exerting, an, attractive, force, on, all, objects, assuming, a, spherically, symmetrical, planet, the, strength, of, this, field, at, any, given, point, above, the, surface, is, proportional, to, the, planetary, body, s, mass, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, from, the, center, of, the, body, the, strength, of, the, gravitational, field, is, numerically, equal, to, the, acceleration, of, objects, under, its, influence, the, rate, of, acceleration, of, falling, objects, near, the, earth, s, surface, varies, very, slightly, depending, on, latitude, surface, features, such, as, mountains, and, ridges, and, perhaps, unusually, high, or, low, sub, surface, densities, for, purposes, of, weights, and, measures, a, standard, gravity, value, is, defined, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, under, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, force, of, gravity, on, earth, is, the, resultant, vector, sum, of, two, forces, a, the, gravitational, attraction, in, accordance, with, newton, s, universal, law, of, gravitation, and, b, the, centrifugal, force, which, results, from, the, choice, of, an, earthbound, rotating, frame, of, reference, the, force, of, gravity, is, weakest, at, the, equator, because, of, the, centrifugal, force, caused, by, the, earth, s, rotation, and, because, points, on, the, equator, are, furthest, from, the, center, of, the, earth, the, force, of, gravity, varies, with, latitude, and, increases, from, about, 9, 780, m, s, 2, at, the, equator, to, about, 9, 832, m, s, 2, at, the, poles, general, relativity, predicts, that, energy, can, be, transported, out, of, a, system, through, gravitational, radiation, the, first, indirect, evidence, for, gravitational, radiation, was, through, measurements, of, the, hulse, taylor, binary, in, 1973, this, system, consists, of, a, pulsar, and, neutron, star, in, orbit, around, one, another, its, orbital, period, has, decreased, since, its, initial, discovery, due, to, a, loss, of, energy, which, is, consistent, for, the, amount, of, energy, loss, due, to, gravitational, radiation, this, research, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1993, the, first, direct, evidence, for, gravitational, radiation, was, measured, on, 14, september, 2015, by, the, ligo, detectors, the, gravitational, waves, emitted, during, the, collision, of, two, black, holes, 1, 3, billion, light, years, from, earth, were, measured, this, observation, confirms, the, theoretical, predictions, of, einstein, and, others, that, such, waves, exist, it, also, opens, the, way, for, practical, observation, and, understanding, of, the, nature, of, gravity, and, events, in, the, universe, including, the, big, bang, neutron, star, and, black, hole, formation, also, create, detectable, amounts, of, gravitational, radiation, this, research, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 2017, in, december, 2012, a, research, team, in, china, announced, that, it, had, produced, measurements, of, the, phase, lag, of, earth, tides, during, full, and, new, moons, which, seem, to, prove, that, the, speed, of, gravity, is, equal, to, the, speed, of, light, this, means, that, if, the, sun, suddenly, disappeared, the, earth, would, keep, orbiting, the, vacant, point, normally, for, 8, minutes, which, is, the, time, light, takes, to, travel, that, distance, the, team, s, findings, were, released, in, science, bulletin, in, february, 2013, in, october, 2017, the, ligo, and, virgo, detectors, received, gravitational, wave, signals, within, 2, seconds, of, gamma, ray, satellites, and, optical, telescopes, seeing, signals, from, the, same, direction, this, confirmed, that, the, speed, of, gravitational, waves, was, the, same, as, the, speed, of, light, there, are, some, observations, that, are, not, adequately, accounted, for, which, may, point, to, the, need, for, better, theories, of, gravity, or, perhaps, be, explained, in, other, ways
