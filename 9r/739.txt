meteorology, is, a, branch, of, the, atmospheric, sciences, which, include, atmospheric, chemistry, and, physics, with, a, major, focus, on, weather, forecasting, the, study, of, meteorology, dates, back, millennia, though, significant, progress, in, meteorology, did, not, begin, until, the, 18th, century, the, 19th, century, saw, modest, progress, in, the, field, after, weather, observation, networks, were, formed, across, broad, regions, prior, attempts, at, prediction, of, weather, depended, on, historical, data, it, was, not, until, after, the, elucidation, of, the, laws, of, physics, and, more, particularly, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, development, of, the, computer, allowing, for, the, automated, solution, of, a, great, many, modelling, equations, that, significant, breakthroughs, in, weather, forecasting, were, achieved, an, important, branch, of, weather, forecasting, is, marine, weather, forecasting, as, it, relates, to, maritime, and, coastal, safety, in, which, weather, effects, also, include, atmospheric, interactions, with, large, bodies, of, water, meteorological, phenomena, are, observable, weather, events, that, are, explained, by, the, science, of, meteorology, meteorological, phenomena, are, described, and, quantified, by, the, variables, of, earth, s, atmosphere, temperature, air, pressure, water, vapour, mass, flow, and, the, variations, and, interactions, of, these, variables, and, how, they, change, over, time, different, spatial, scales, are, used, to, describe, and, predict, weather, on, local, regional, and, global, levels, meteorology, climatology, atmospheric, physics, and, atmospheric, chemistry, are, sub, disciplines, of, the, atmospheric, sciences, meteorology, and, hydrology, compose, the, interdisciplinary, field, of, hydrometeorology, the, interactions, between, earth, s, atmosphere, and, its, oceans, are, part, of, a, coupled, ocean, atmosphere, system, meteorology, has, application, in, many, diverse, fields, such, as, the, military, energy, production, transport, agriculture, and, construction, the, word, meteorology, is, from, the, ancient, greek, met, ros, meteor, and, logia, o, logy, meaning, the, study, of, things, high, in, the, air, early, attempts, at, predicting, weather, were, often, related, to, prophecy, and, divining, and, were, sometimes, based, on, astrological, ideas, ancient, religions, believed, meteorological, phenomena, to, be, under, the, control, of, the, gods, the, ability, to, predict, rains, and, floods, based, on, annual, cycles, was, evidently, used, by, humans, at, least, from, the, time, of, agricultural, settlement, if, not, earlier, early, approaches, to, predicting, weather, were, based, on, astrology, and, were, practiced, by, priests, the, egyptians, had, rain, making, rituals, as, early, as, 3500, bc, ancient, indian, upanishads, contain, mentions, of, clouds, and, seasons, the, samaveda, mentions, sacrifices, to, be, performed, when, certain, phenomena, were, noticed, var, hamihira, s, classical, work, brihatsamhita, written, about, 500, ad, provides, evidence, of, weather, observation, cuneiform, inscriptions, on, babylonian, tablets, included, associations, between, thunder, and, rain, the, chaldeans, differentiated, the, 22, and, 46, halos, the, ancient, greeks, were, the, first, to, make, theories, about, the, weather, many, natural, philosophers, studied, the, weather, however, as, meteorological, instruments, did, not, exist, the, inquiry, was, largely, qualitative, and, could, only, be, judged, by, more, general, theoretical, speculations, herodotus, states, that, thales, predicted, the, solar, eclipse, of, 585, bc, he, studied, babylonian, equinox, tables, according, to, seneca, he, gave, the, explanation, that, the, cause, of, the, nile, s, annual, floods, was, due, to, northerly, winds, hindering, its, descent, by, the, sea, anaximander, and, anaximenes, thought, that, thunder, and, lightning, was, caused, by, air, smashing, against, the, cloud, thus, kindling, the, flame, early, meteorological, theories, generally, considered, that, there, was, a, fire, like, substance, in, the, atmosphere, anaximander, defined, wind, as, a, flowing, of, air, but, this, was, not, generally, accepted, for, centuries, a, theory, to, explain, summer, hail, was, first, proposed, by, anaxagoras, he, observed, that, air, temperature, decreased, with, increasing, height, and, that, clouds, contain, moisture, he, also, noted, that, heat, caused, objects, to, rise, and, therefore, the, heat, on, a, summer, day, would, drive, clouds, to, an, altitude, where, the, moisture, would, freeze, empedocles, theorized, on, the, change, of, the, seasons, he, believed, that, fire, and, water, opposed, each, other, in, the, atmosphere, and, when, fire, gained, the, upper, hand, the, result, was, summer, and, when, water, did, it, was, winter, democritus, also, wrote, about, the, flooding, of, the, nile, he, said, that, during, the, summer, solstice, snow, in, northern, parts, of, the, world, melted, this, would, cause, vapors, to, form, clouds, which, would, cause, storms, when, driven, to, the, nile, by, northerly, winds, thus, filling, the, lakes, and, the, nile, hippocrates, inquired, into, the, effect, of, weather, on, health, eudoxus, claimed, that, bad, weather, followed, four, year, periods, according, to, pliny, these, early, observations, would, form, the, basis, for, aristotle, s, meteorology, written, in, 350, bc, aristotle, is, considered, the, founder, of, meteorology, one, of, the, most, impressive, achievements, described, in, the, meteorology, is, the, description, of, what, is, now, known, as, the, hydrologic, cycle, his, work, would, remain, an, authority, on, meteorology, for, nearly, 2, 000, years, the, book, de, mundo, composed, before, 250, bc, or, between, 350, and, 200, bc, noted, after, aristotle, progress, in, meteorology, stalled, for, a, long, time, theophrastus, compiled, a, book, on, weather, forecasting, called, the, book, of, signs, as, well, as, on, winds, he, gave, hundreds, of, signs, for, weather, phenomena, for, a, period, up, to, a, year, his, system, was, based, on, dividing, the, year, by, the, setting, and, the, rising, of, the, pleiad, halves, into, solstices, and, equinoxes, and, the, continuity, of, the, weather, for, those, periods, he, also, divided, months, into, the, new, moon, fourth, day, eighth, day, and, full, moon, in, likelihood, of, a, change, in, the, weather, occurring, the, day, was, divided, into, sunrise, mid, morning, noon, mid, afternoon, and, sunset, with, corresponding, divisions, of, the, night, with, change, being, likely, at, one, of, these, divisions, applying, the, divisions, and, a, principle, of, balance, in, the, yearly, weather, he, came, up, with, forecasts, like, that, if, a, lot, of, rain, falls, in, the, winter, the, spring, is, usually, dry, rules, based, on, actions, of, animals, are, also, present, in, his, work, like, that, if, a, dog, rolls, on, the, ground, it, is, a, sign, of, a, storm, shooting, stars, and, the, moon, were, also, considered, significant, however, he, made, no, attempt, to, explain, these, phenomena, referring, only, to, the, aristotelian, method, the, work, of, theophrastus, remained, a, dominant, influence, in, weather, forecasting, for, nearly, 2, 000, years, meteorology, continued, to, be, studied, and, developed, over, the, centuries, but, it, was, not, until, the, renaissance, in, the, 14th, to, 17th, centuries, that, significant, advancements, were, made, in, the, field, scientists, such, as, galileo, and, descartes, introduced, new, methods, and, ideas, leading, to, the, scientific, revolution, in, meteorology, speculation, on, the, cause, of, the, flooding, of, the, nile, ended, when, eratosthenes, according, to, proclus, stated, that, it, was, known, that, man, had, gone, to, the, sources, of, the, nile, and, observed, the, rains, although, interest, in, its, implications, continued, during, the, era, of, roman, greece, and, europe, scientific, interest, in, meteorology, waned, in, the, 1st, century, bc, most, natural, philosophers, claimed, that, the, clouds, and, winds, extended, up, to, 111, miles, but, posidonius, thought, that, they, reached, up, to, five, miles, after, which, the, air, is, clear, liquid, and, luminous, he, closely, followed, aristotle, s, theories, by, the, end, of, the, second, century, bc, the, center, of, science, shifted, from, athens, to, alexandria, home, to, the, ancient, library, of, alexandria, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, ptolemy, s, almagest, dealt, with, meteorology, because, it, was, considered, a, subset, of, astronomy, he, gave, several, astrological, weather, predictions, he, constructed, a, map, of, the, world, divided, into, climatic, zones, by, their, illumination, in, which, the, length, of, the, summer, solstice, increased, by, half, an, hour, per, zone, between, the, equator, and, the, arctic, ptolemy, wrote, on, the, atmospheric, refraction, of, light, in, the, context, of, astronomical, observations, in, 25, ad, pomponius, mela, a, roman, geographer, formalized, the, climatic, zone, system, in, 63, 64, ad, seneca, wrote, naturales, quaestiones, it, was, a, compilation, and, synthesis, of, ancient, greek, theories, however, theology, was, of, foremost, importance, to, seneca, and, he, believed, that, phenomena, such, as, lightning, were, tied, to, fate, the, second, book, chapter, of, pliny, s, natural, history, covers, meteorology, he, states, that, more, than, twenty, ancient, greek, authors, studied, meteorology, he, did, not, make, any, personal, contributions, and, the, value, of, his, work, is, in, preserving, earlier, speculation, much, like, seneca, s, work, from, 400, to, 1100, scientific, learning, in, europe, was, preserved, by, the, clergy, isidore, of, seville, devoted, a, considerable, attention, to, meteorology, in, etymologiae, de, ordine, creaturum, and, de, natura, rerum, bede, the, venerable, was, the, first, englishman, to, write, about, the, weather, in, de, natura, rerum, in, 703, the, work, was, a, summary, of, then, extant, classical, sources, however, aristotle, s, works, were, largely, lost, until, the, twelfth, century, including, meteorologica, isidore, and, bede, were, scientifically, minded, but, they, adhered, to, the, letter, of, scripture, islamic, civilization, translated, many, ancient, works, into, arabic, which, were, transmitted, and, translated, in, western, europe, to, latin, in, the, 9th, century, al, dinawari, wrote, the, kitab, al, nabat, book, of, plants, in, which, he, deals, with, the, application, of, meteorology, to, agriculture, during, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, he, describes, the, meteorological, character, of, the, sky, the, planets, and, constellations, the, sun, and, moon, the, lunar, phases, indicating, seasons, and, rain, the, anwa, heavenly, bodies, of, rain, and, atmospheric, phenomena, such, as, winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes, in, 1021, alhazen, showed, that, atmospheric, refraction, is, also, responsible, for, twilight, in, opticae, thesaurus, he, estimated, that, twilight, begins, when, the, sun, is, 19, degrees, below, the, horizon, and, also, used, a, geometric, determination, based, on, this, to, estimate, the, maximum, possible, height, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, as, 52, 000, passim, about, 49, miles, or, 79, km, adelard, of, bath, was, one, of, the, early, translators, of, the, classics, he, also, discussed, meteorological, topics, in, his, quaestiones, naturales, he, thought, dense, air, produced, propulsion, in, the, form, of, wind, he, explained, thunder, by, saying, that, it, was, due, to, ice, colliding, in, clouds, and, in, summer, it, melted, in, the, thirteenth, century, aristotelian, theories, reestablished, dominance, in, meteorology, for, the, next, four, centuries, meteorological, work, by, and, large, was, mostly, commentary, it, has, been, estimated, over, 156, commentaries, on, the, meteorologica, were, written, before, 1650, experimental, evidence, was, less, important, than, appeal, to, the, classics, and, authority, in, medieval, thought, in, the, thirteenth, century, roger, bacon, advocated, experimentation, and, the, mathematical, approach, in, his, opus, majus, he, followed, aristotle, s, theory, on, the, atmosphere, being, composed, of, water, air, and, fire, supplemented, by, optics, and, geometric, proofs, he, noted, that, ptolemy, s, climatic, zones, had, to, be, adjusted, for, topography, st, albert, the, great, was, the, first, to, propose, that, each, drop, of, falling, rain, had, the, form, of, a, small, sphere, and, that, this, form, meant, that, the, rainbow, was, produced, by, light, interacting, with, each, raindrop, roger, bacon, was, the, first, to, calculate, the, angular, size, of, the, rainbow, he, stated, that, a, rainbow, summit, cannot, appear, higher, than, 42, degrees, above, the, horizon, in, the, late, 13th, century, and, early, 14th, century, kam, l, al, d, n, al, f, ris, and, theodoric, of, freiberg, were, the, first, to, give, the, correct, explanations, for, the, primary, rainbow, phenomenon, theoderic, went, further, and, also, explained, the, secondary, rainbow, by, the, middle, of, the, sixteenth, century, meteorology, had, developed, along, two, lines, theoretical, science, based, on, meteorologica, and, astrological, weather, forecasting, the, pseudoscientific, prediction, by, natural, signs, became, popular, and, enjoyed, protection, of, the, church, and, princes, this, was, supported, by, scientists, like, johannes, muller, leonard, digges, and, johannes, kepler, however, there, were, skeptics, in, the, 14th, century, nicole, oresme, believed, that, weather, forecasting, was, possible, but, that, the, rules, for, it, were, unknown, at, the, time, astrological, influence, in, meteorology, persisted, until, the, eighteenth, century, gerolamo, cardano, s, de, subilitate, 1550, was, the, first, work, to, challenge, fundamental, aspects, of, aristotelian, theory, cardano, maintained, that, there, were, only, three, basic, elements, earth, air, and, water, he, discounted, fire, because, it, needed, material, to, spread, and, produced, nothing, cardano, thought, there, were, two, kinds, of, air, free, air, and, enclosed, air, the, former, destroyed, inanimate, things, and, preserved, animate, things, while, the, latter, had, the, opposite, effect, rene, descartes, s, discourse, on, the, method, 1637, typifies, the, beginning, of, the, scientific, revolution, in, meteorology, his, scientific, method, had, four, principles, to, never, accept, anything, unless, one, clearly, knew, it, to, be, true, to, divide, every, difficult, problem, into, small, problems, to, tackle, to, proceed, from, the, simple, to, the, complex, always, seeking, relationships, to, be, as, complete, and, thorough, as, possible, with, no, prejudice, in, the, appendix, les, meteores, he, applied, these, principles, to, meteorology, he, discussed, terrestrial, bodies, and, vapors, which, arise, from, them, proceeding, to, explain, the, formation, of, clouds, from, drops, of, water, and, winds, clouds, then, dissolving, into, rain, hail, and, snow, he, also, discussed, the, effects, of, light, on, the, rainbow, descartes, hypothesized, that, all, bodies, were, composed, of, small, particles, of, different, shapes, and, interwovenness, all, of, his, theories, were, based, on, this, hypothesis, he, explained, the, rain, as, caused, by, clouds, becoming, too, large, for, the, air, to, hold, and, that, clouds, became, snow, if, the, air, was, not, warm, enough, to, melt, them, or, hail, if, they, met, colder, wind, like, his, predecessors, descartes, s, method, was, deductive, as, meteorological, instruments, were, not, developed, and, extensively, used, yet, he, introduced, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, to, meteorology, and, stressed, the, importance, of, mathematics, in, natural, science, his, work, established, meteorology, as, a, legitimate, branch, of, physics, in, the, 18th, century, the, invention, of, the, thermometer, and, barometer, allowed, for, more, accurate, measurements, of, temperature, and, pressure, leading, to, a, better, understanding, of, atmospheric, processes, this, century, also, saw, the, birth, of, the, first, meteorological, society, the, societas, meteorologica, palatina, in, 1780, in, the, 19th, century, advances, in, technology, such, as, the, telegraph, and, photography, led, to, the, creation, of, weather, observing, networks, and, the, ability, to, track, storms, additionally, scientists, began, to, use, mathematical, models, to, make, predictions, about, the, weather, the, 20th, century, saw, the, development, of, radar, and, satellite, technology, which, greatly, improved, the, ability, to, observe, and, track, weather, systems, in, addition, meteorologists, and, atmospheric, scientists, started, to, create, the, first, weather, forecasts, and, temperature, predictions, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, with, the, advent, of, computer, models, and, big, data, meteorology, has, become, increasingly, dependent, on, numerical, methods, and, computer, simulations, this, has, greatly, improved, weather, forecasting, and, climate, predictions, additionally, meteorology, has, expanded, to, include, other, areas, such, as, air, quality, atmospheric, chemistry, and, climatology, the, advancement, in, observational, theoretical, and, computational, technologies, has, enabled, ever, more, accurate, weather, predictions, and, understanding, of, weather, pattern, and, air, pollution, in, current, time, with, the, advancement, in, weather, forecasting, and, satellite, technology, meteorology, has, become, an, integral, part, of, everyday, life, and, is, used, for, many, purposes, such, as, aviation, agriculture, and, disaster, management, in, 1441, king, sejong, s, son, prince, munjong, of, korea, invented, the, first, standardized, rain, gauge, these, were, sent, throughout, the, joseon, dynasty, of, korea, as, an, official, tool, to, assess, land, taxes, based, upon, a, farmer, s, potential, harvest, in, 1450, leone, battista, alberti, developed, a, swinging, plate, anemometer, and, was, known, as, the, first, anemometer, in, 1607, galileo, galilei, constructed, a, thermoscope, in, 1611, johannes, kepler, wrote, the, first, scientific, treatise, on, snow, crystals, strena, seu, de, nive, sexangula, a, new, year, s, gift, of, hexagonal, snow, in, 1643, evangelista, torricelli, invented, the, mercury, barometer, in, 1662, sir, christopher, wren, invented, the, mechanical, self, emptying, tipping, bucket, rain, gauge, in, 1714, gabriel, fahrenheit, created, a, reliable, scale, for, measuring, temperature, with, a, mercury, type, thermometer, in, 1742, anders, celsius, a, swedish, astronomer, proposed, the, centigrade, temperature, scale, the, predecessor, of, the, current, celsius, scale, in, 1783, the, first, hair, hygrometer, was, demonstrated, by, horace, b, n, dict, de, saussure, in, 1802, 1803, luke, howard, wrote, on, the, modification, of, clouds, in, which, he, assigns, cloud, types, latin, names, in, 1806, francis, beaufort, introduced, his, system, for, classifying, wind, speeds, near, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, first, cloud, atlases, were, published, including, the, international, cloud, atlas, which, has, remained, in, print, ever, since, the, april, 1960, launch, of, the, first, successful, weather, satellite, tiros, 1, marked, the, beginning, of, the, age, where, weather, information, became, available, globally, in, 1648, blaise, pascal, rediscovered, that, atmospheric, pressure, decreases, with, height, and, deduced, that, there, is, a, vacuum, above, the, atmosphere, in, 1738, daniel, bernoulli, published, hydrodynamics, initiating, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, and, established, the, basic, laws, for, the, theory, of, gases, in, 1761, joseph, black, discovered, that, ice, absorbs, heat, without, changing, its, temperature, when, melting, in, 1772, black, s, student, daniel, rutherford, discovered, nitrogen, which, he, called, phlogisticated, air, and, together, they, developed, the, phlogiston, theory, in, 1777, antoine, lavoisier, discovered, oxygen, and, developed, an, explanation, for, combustion, in, 1783, in, lavoisier, s, essay, reflexions, sur, le, phlogistique, he, deprecates, the, phlogiston, theory, and, proposes, a, caloric, theory, in, 1804, john, leslie, observed, that, a, matte, black, surface, radiates, heat, more, effectively, than, a, polished, surface, suggesting, the, importance, of, black, body, radiation, in, 1808, john, dalton, defended, caloric, theory, in, a, new, system, of, chemistry, and, described, how, it, combines, with, matter, especially, gases, he, proposed, that, the, heat, capacity, of, gases, varies, inversely, with, atomic, weight, in, 1824, sadi, carnot, analyzed, the, efficiency, of, steam, engines, using, caloric, theory, he, developed, the, notion, of, a, reversible, process, and, in, postulating, that, no, such, thing, exists, in, nature, laid, the, foundation, for, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, 1716, edmund, halley, suggested, that, aurorae, are, caused, by, magnetic, effluvia, moving, along, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, lines, in, 1494, christopher, columbus, experienced, a, tropical, cyclone, which, led, to, the, first, written, european, account, of, a, hurricane, in, 1686, edmund, halley, presented, a, systematic, study, of, the, trade, winds, and, monsoons, and, identified, solar, heating, as, the, cause, of, atmospheric, motions, in, 1735, an, ideal, explanation, of, global, circulation, through, study, of, the, trade, winds, was, written, by, george, hadley, in, 1743, when, benjamin, franklin, was, prevented, from, seeing, a, lunar, eclipse, by, a, hurricane, he, decided, that, cyclones, move, in, a, contrary, manner, to, the, winds, at, their, periphery, understanding, the, kinematics, of, how, exactly, the, rotation, of, the, earth, affects, airflow, was, partial, at, first, gaspard, gustave, coriolis, published, a, paper, in, 1835, on, the, energy, yield, of, machines, with, rotating, parts, such, as, waterwheels, in, 1856, william, ferrel, proposed, the, existence, of, a, circulation, cell, in, the, mid, latitudes, and, the, air, within, deflected, by, the, coriolis, force, resulting, in, the, prevailing, westerly, winds, late, in, the, 19th, century, the, motion, of, air, masses, along, isobars, was, understood, to, be, the, result, of, the, large, scale, interaction, of, the, pressure, gradient, force, and, the, deflecting, force, by, 1912, this, deflecting, force, was, named, the, coriolis, effect, just, after, world, war, i, a, group, of, meteorologists, in, norway, led, by, vilhelm, bjerknes, developed, the, norwegian, cyclone, model, that, explains, the, generation, intensification, and, ultimate, decay, the, life, cycle, of, mid, latitude, cyclones, and, introduced, the, idea, of, fronts, that, is, sharply, defined, boundaries, between, air, masses, the, group, included, carl, gustaf, rossby, who, was, the, first, to, explain, the, large, scale, atmospheric, flow, in, terms, of, fluid, dynamics, tor, bergeron, who, first, determined, how, rain, forms, and, jacob, bjerknes, in, the, late, 16th, century, and, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, a, range, of, meteorological, instruments, were, invented, the, thermometer, barometer, hydrometer, as, well, as, wind, and, rain, gauges, in, the, 1650s, natural, philosophers, started, using, these, instruments, to, systematically, record, weather, observations, scientific, academies, established, weather, diaries, and, organised, observational, networks, in, 1654, ferdinando, ii, de, medici, established, the, first, weather, observing, network, that, consisted, of, meteorological, stations, in, florence, cutigliano, vallombrosa, bologna, parma, milan, innsbruck, osnabr, ck, paris, and, warsaw, the, collected, data, were, sent, to, florence, at, regular, time, intervals, in, the, 1660s, robert, hooke, of, the, royal, society, of, london, sponsored, networks, of, weather, observers, hippocrates, treatise, airs, waters, and, places, had, linked, weather, to, disease, thus, early, meteorologists, attempted, to, correlate, weather, patterns, with, epidemic, outbreaks, and, the, climate, with, public, health, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, meteorology, tried, to, rationalise, traditional, weather, lore, including, astrological, meteorology, but, there, were, also, attempts, to, establish, a, theoretical, understanding, of, weather, phenomena, edmond, halley, and, george, hadley, tried, to, explain, trade, winds, they, reasoned, that, the, rising, mass, of, heated, equator, air, is, replaced, by, an, inflow, of, cooler, air, from, high, latitudes, a, flow, of, warm, air, at, high, altitude, from, equator, to, poles, in, turn, established, an, early, picture, of, circulation, frustration, with, the, lack, of, discipline, among, weather, observers, and, the, poor, quality, of, the, instruments, led, the, early, modern, nation, states, to, organise, large, observation, networks, thus, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, meteorologists, had, access, to, large, quantities, of, reliable, weather, data, in, 1832, an, electromagnetic, telegraph, was, created, by, baron, schilling, the, arrival, of, the, electrical, telegraph, in, 1837, afforded, for, the, first, time, a, practical, method, for, quickly, gathering, surface, weather, observations, from, a, wide, area, this, data, could, be, used, to, produce, maps, of, the, state, of, the, atmosphere, for, a, region, near, the, earth, s, surface, and, to, study, how, these, states, evolved, through, time, to, make, frequent, weather, forecasts, based, on, these, data, required, a, reliable, network, of, observations, but, it, was, not, until, 1849, that, the, smithsonian, institution, began, to, establish, an, observation, network, across, the, united, states, under, the, leadership, of, joseph, henry, similar, observation, networks, were, established, in, europe, at, this, time, the, reverend, william, clement, ley, was, key, in, understanding, of, cirrus, clouds, and, early, understandings, of, jet, streams, charles, kenneth, mackinnon, douglas, known, as, ckm, douglas, read, ley, s, papers, after, his, death, and, carried, on, the, early, study, of, weather, systems, nineteenth, century, researchers, in, meteorology, were, drawn, from, military, or, medical, backgrounds, rather, than, trained, as, dedicated, scientists, in, 1854, the, united, kingdom, government, appointed, robert, fitzroy, to, the, new, office, of, meteorological, statist, to, the, board, of, trade, with, the, task, of, gathering, weather, observations, at, sea, fitzroy, s, office, became, the, united, kingdom, meteorological, office, in, 1854, the, second, oldest, national, meteorological, service, in, the, world, the, central, institution, for, meteorology, and, geodynamics, zamg, in, austria, was, founded, in, 1851, and, is, the, oldest, weather, service, in, the, world, the, first, daily, weather, forecasts, made, by, fitzroy, s, office, were, published, in, the, times, newspaper, in, 1860, the, following, year, a, system, was, introduced, of, hoisting, storm, warning, cones, at, principal, ports, when, a, gale, was, expected, fitzroy, coined, the, term, weather, forecast, and, tried, to, separate, scientific, approaches, from, prophetic, ones, over, the, next, 50, years, many, countries, established, national, meteorological, services, the, india, meteorological, department, 1875, was, established, to, follow, tropical, cyclone, and, monsoon, the, finnish, meteorological, central, office, 1881, was, formed, from, part, of, magnetic, observatory, of, helsinki, university, japan, s, tokyo, meteorological, observatory, the, forerunner, of, the, japan, meteorological, agency, began, constructing, surface, weather, maps, in, 1883, the, united, states, weather, bureau, 1890, was, established, under, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, the, australian, bureau, of, meteorology, 1906, was, established, by, a, meteorology, act, to, unify, existing, state, meteorological, services, in, 1904, norwegian, scientist, vilhelm, bjerknes, first, argued, in, his, paper, weather, forecasting, as, a, problem, in, mechanics, and, physics, that, it, should, be, possible, to, forecast, weather, from, calculations, based, upon, natural, laws, it, was, not, until, later, in, the, 20th, century, that, advances, in, the, understanding, of, atmospheric, physics, led, to, the, foundation, of, modern, numerical, weather, prediction, in, 1922, lewis, fry, richardson, published, weather, prediction, by, numerical, process, after, finding, notes, and, derivations, he, worked, on, as, an, ambulance, driver, in, world, war, i, he, described, how, small, terms, in, the, prognostic, fluid, dynamics, equations, that, govern, atmospheric, flow, could, be, neglected, and, a, numerical, calculation, scheme, that, could, be, devised, to, allow, predictions, richardson, envisioned, a, large, auditorium, of, thousands, of, people, performing, the, calculations, however, the, sheer, number, of, calculations, required, was, too, large, to, complete, without, electronic, computers, and, the, size, of, the, grid, and, time, steps, used, in, the, calculations, led, to, unrealistic, results, though, numerical, analysis, later, found, that, this, was, due, to, numerical, instability, starting, in, the, 1950s, numerical, forecasts, with, computers, became, feasible, the, first, weather, forecasts, derived, this, way, used, barotropic, single, vertical, level, models, and, could, successfully, predict, the, large, scale, movement, of, midlatitude, rossby, waves, that, is, the, pattern, of, atmospheric, lows, and, highs, in, 1959, the, uk, meteorological, office, received, its, first, computer, a, ferranti, mercury, in, the, 1960s, the, chaotic, nature, of, the, atmosphere, was, first, observed, and, mathematically, described, by, edward, lorenz, founding, the, field, of, chaos, theory, these, advances, have, led, to, the, current, use, of, ensemble, forecasting, in, most, major, forecasting, centers, to, take, into, account, uncertainty, arising, from, the, chaotic, nature, of, the, atmosphere, mathematical, models, used, to, predict, the, long, term, weather, of, the, earth, climate, models, have, been, developed, that, have, a, resolution, today, that, are, as, coarse, as, the, older, weather, prediction, models, these, climate, models, are, used, to, investigate, long, term, climate, shifts, such, as, what, effects, might, be, caused, by, human, emission, of, greenhouse, gases, meteorologists, are, scientists, who, study, and, work, in, the, field, of, meteorology, the, american, meteorological, society, publishes, and, continually, updates, an, authoritative, electronic, meteorology, glossary, meteorologists, work, in, government, agencies, private, consulting, and, research, services, industrial, enterprises, utilities, radio, and, television, stations, and, in, education, in, the, united, states, meteorologists, held, about, 10, 000, jobs, in, 2018, although, weather, forecasts, and, warnings, are, the, best, known, products, of, meteorologists, for, the, public, weather, presenters, on, radio, and, television, are, not, necessarily, professional, meteorologists, they, are, most, often, reporters, with, little, formal, meteorological, training, using, unregulated, titles, such, as, weather, specialist, or, weatherman, the, american, meteorological, society, and, national, weather, association, issue, seals, of, approval, to, weather, broadcasters, who, meet, certain, requirements, but, this, is, not, mandatory, to, be, hired, by, the, media, each, science, has, its, own, unique, sets, of, laboratory, equipment, in, the, atmosphere, there, are, many, things, or, qualities, of, the, atmosphere, that, can, be, measured, rain, which, can, be, observed, or, seen, anywhere, and, anytime, was, one, of, the, first, atmospheric, qualities, measured, historically, also, two, other, accurately, measured, qualities, are, wind, and, humidity, neither, of, these, can, be, seen, but, can, be, felt, the, devices, to, measure, these, three, sprang, up, in, the, mid, 15th, century, and, were, respectively, the, rain, gauge, the, anemometer, and, the, hygrometer, many, attempts, had, been, made, prior, to, the, 15th, century, to, construct, adequate, equipment, to, measure, the, many, atmospheric, variables, many, were, faulty, in, some, way, or, were, simply, not, reliable, even, aristotle, noted, this, in, some, of, his, work, as, the, difficulty, to, measure, the, air, sets, of, surface, measurements, are, important, data, to, meteorologists, they, give, a, snapshot, of, a, variety, of, weather, conditions, at, one, single, location, and, are, usually, at, a, weather, station, a, ship, or, a, weather, buoy, the, measurements, taken, at, a, weather, station, can, include, any, number, of, atmospheric, observables, usually, temperature, pressure, wind, measurements, and, humidity, are, the, variables, that, are, measured, by, a, thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and, hygrometer, respectively, professional, stations, may, also, include, air, quality, sensors, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and, smoke, ceilometer, cloud, ceiling, falling, precipitation, sensor, flood, sensor, lightning, sensor, microphone, explosions, sonic, booms, thunder, pyranometer, pyrheliometer, spectroradiometer, ir, vis, uv, photodiodes, rain, gauge, snow, gauge, scintillation, counter, background, radiation, fallout, radon, seismometer, earthquakes, and, tremors, transmissometer, visibility, and, a, gps, clock, for, data, logging, upper, air, data, are, of, crucial, importance, for, weather, forecasting, the, most, widely, used, technique, is, launches, of, radiosondes, supplementing, the, radiosondes, a, network, of, aircraft, collection, is, organized, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, remote, sensing, as, used, in, meteorology, is, the, concept, of, collecting, data, from, remote, weather, events, and, subsequently, producing, weather, information, the, common, types, of, remote, sensing, are, radar, lidar, and, satellites, or, photogrammetry, each, collects, data, about, the, atmosphere, from, a, remote, location, and, usually, stores, the, data, where, the, instrument, is, located, radar, and, lidar, are, not, passive, because, both, use, em, radiation, to, illuminate, a, specific, portion, of, the, atmosphere, weather, satellites, along, with, more, general, purpose, earth, observing, satellites, circling, the, earth, at, various, altitudes, have, become, an, indispensable, tool, for, studying, a, wide, range, of, phenomena, from, forest, fires, to, el, ni, o, the, study, of, the, atmosphere, can, be, divided, into, distinct, areas, that, depend, on, both, time, and, spatial, scales, at, one, extreme, of, this, scale, is, climatology, in, the, timescales, of, hours, to, days, meteorology, separates, into, micro, meso, and, synoptic, scale, meteorology, respectively, the, geospatial, size, of, each, of, these, three, scales, relates, directly, with, the, appropriate, timescale, other, subclassifications, are, used, to, describe, the, unique, local, or, broad, effects, within, those, subclasses, microscale, meteorology, is, the, study, of, atmospheric, phenomena, on, a, scale, of, about, 1, kilometre, 0, 62, mi, or, less, individual, thunderstorms, clouds, and, local, turbulence, caused, by, buildings, and, other, obstacles, such, as, individual, hills, are, modeled, on, this, scale, mesoscale, meteorology, is, the, study, of, atmospheric, phenomena, that, has, horizontal, scales, ranging, from, 1, km, to, 1000, km, and, a, vertical, scale, that, starts, at, the, earth, s, surface, and, includes, the, atmospheric, boundary, layer, troposphere, tropopause, and, the, lower, section, of, the, stratosphere, mesoscale, timescales, last, from, less, than, a, day, to, multiple, weeks, the, events, typically, of, interest, are, thunderstorms, squall, lines, fronts, precipitation, bands, in, tropical, and, extratropical, cyclones, and, topographically, generated, weather, systems, such, as, mountain, waves, and, sea, and, land, breezes, synoptic, scale, meteorology, predicts, atmospheric, changes, at, scales, up, to, 1000, km, and, 10, 5, sec, 28, days, in, time, and, space, at, the, synoptic, scale, the, coriolis, acceleration, acting, on, moving, air, masses, outside, of, the, tropics, plays, a, dominant, role, in, predictions, the, phenomena, typically, described, by, synoptic, meteorology, include, events, such, as, extratropical, cyclones, baroclinic, troughs, and, ridges, frontal, zones, and, to, some, extent, jet, streams, all, of, these, are, typically, given, on, weather, maps, for, a, specific, time, the, minimum, horizontal, scale, of, synoptic, phenomena, is, limited, to, the, spacing, between, surface, observation, stations, global, scale, meteorology, is, the, study, of, weather, patterns, related, to, the, transport, of, heat, from, the, tropics, to, the, poles, very, large, scale, oscillations, are, of, importance, at, this, scale, these, oscillations, have, time, periods, typically, on, the, order, of, months, such, as, the, madden, julian, oscillation, or, years, such, as, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, and, the, pacific, decadal, oscillation, global, scale, meteorology, pushes, into, the, range, of, climatology, the, traditional, definition, of, climate, is, pushed, into, larger, timescales, and, with, the, understanding, of, the, longer, time, scale, global, oscillations, their, effect, on, climate, and, weather, disturbances, can, be, included, in, the, synoptic, and, mesoscale, timescales, predictions, numerical, weather, prediction, is, a, main, focus, in, understanding, air, sea, interaction, tropical, meteorology, atmospheric, predictability, and, tropospheric, stratospheric, processes, the, naval, research, laboratory, in, monterey, california, developed, a, global, atmospheric, model, called, navy, operational, global, atmospheric, prediction, system, nogaps, nogaps, is, run, operationally, at, fleet, numerical, meteorology, and, oceanography, center, for, the, united, states, military, many, other, global, atmospheric, models, are, run, by, national, meteorological, agencies, boundary, layer, meteorology, is, the, study, of, processes, in, the, air, layer, directly, above, earth, s, surface, known, as, the, atmospheric, boundary, layer, abl, the, effects, of, the, surface, heating, cooling, and, friction, cause, turbulent, mixing, within, the, air, layer, significant, movement, of, heat, matter, or, momentum, on, time, scales, of, less, than, a, day, are, caused, by, turbulent, motions, boundary, layer, meteorology, includes, the, study, of, all, types, of, surface, atmosphere, boundary, including, ocean, lake, urban, land, and, non, urban, land, for, the, study, of, meteorology, dynamic, meteorology, generally, focuses, on, the, fluid, dynamics, of, the, atmosphere, the, idea, of, air, parcel, is, used, to, define, the, smallest, element, of, the, atmosphere, while, ignoring, the, discrete, molecular, and, chemical, nature, of, the, atmosphere, an, air, parcel, is, defined, as, an, infinitesimal, region, in, the, fluid, continuum, of, the, atmosphere, the, fundamental, laws, of, fluid, dynamics, thermodynamics, and, motion, are, used, to, study, the, atmosphere, the, physical, quantities, that, characterize, the, state, of, the, atmosphere, are, temperature, density, pressure, etc, these, variables, have, unique, values, in, the, continuum, weather, forecasting, is, the, application, of, science, and, technology, to, predict, the, state, of, the, atmosphere, at, a, future, time, and, given, location, humans, have, attempted, to, predict, the, weather, informally, for, millennia, and, formally, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, weather, forecasts, are, made, by, collecting, quantitative, data, about, the, current, state, of, the, atmosphere, and, using, scientific, understanding, of, atmospheric, processes, to, project, how, the, atmosphere, will, evolve, once, an, all, human, endeavor, based, mainly, upon, changes, in, barometric, pressure, current, weather, conditions, and, sky, condition, forecast, models, are, now, used, to, determine, future, conditions, human, input, is, still, required, to, pick, the, best, possible, forecast, model, to, base, the, forecast, upon, which, involves, pattern, recognition, skills, teleconnections, knowledge, of, model, performance, and, knowledge, of, model, biases, the, chaotic, nature, of, the, atmosphere, the, massive, computational, power, required, to, solve, the, equations, that, describe, the, atmosphere, error, involved, in, measuring, the, initial, conditions, and, an, incomplete, understanding, of, atmospheric, processes, mean, that, forecasts, become, less, accurate, as, the, difference, in, current, time, and, the, time, for, which, the, forecast, is, being, made, the, range, of, the, forecast, increases, the, use, of, ensembles, and, model, consensus, help, narrow, the, error, and, pick, the, most, likely, outcome, there, are, a, variety, of, end, uses, to, weather, forecasts, weather, warnings, are, important, forecasts, because, they, are, used, to, protect, life, and, property, forecasts, based, on, temperature, and, precipitation, are, important, to, agriculture, and, therefore, to, commodity, traders, within, stock, markets, temperature, forecasts, are, used, by, utility, companies, to, estimate, demand, over, coming, days, on, an, everyday, basis, people, use, weather, forecasts, to, determine, what, to, wear, since, outdoor, activities, are, severely, curtailed, by, heavy, rain, snow, and, wind, chill, forecasts, can, be, used, to, plan, activities, around, these, events, and, to, plan, ahead, and, survive, them, aviation, meteorology, deals, with, the, impact, of, weather, on, air, traffic, management, it, is, important, for, air, crews, to, understand, the, implications, of, weather, on, their, flight, plan, as, well, as, their, aircraft, as, noted, by, the, aeronautical, information, manual, the, effects, of, ice, on, aircraft, are, cumulative, thrust, is, reduced, drag, increases, lift, lessens, and, weight, increases, the, results, are, an, increase, in, stall, speed, and, a, deterioration, of, aircraft, performance, in, extreme, cases, 2, to, 3, inches, of, ice, can, form, on, the, leading, edge, of, the, airfoil, in, less, than, 5, minutes, it, takes, but, 1, 2, inch, of, ice, to, reduce, the, lifting, power, of, some, aircraft, by, 50, percent, and, increases, the, frictional, drag, by, an, equal, percentage, meteorologists, soil, scientists, agricultural, hydrologists, and, agronomists, are, people, concerned, with, studying, the, effects, of, weather, and, climate, on, plant, distribution, crop, yield, water, use, efficiency, phenology, of, plant, and, animal, development, and, the, energy, balance, of, managed, and, natural, ecosystems, conversely, they, are, interested, in, the, role, of, vegetation, on, climate, and, weather, hydrometeorology, is, the, branch, of, meteorology, that, deals, with, the, hydrologic, cycle, the, water, budget, and, the, rainfall, statistics, of, storms, a, hydrometeorologist, prepares, and, issues, forecasts, of, accumulating, quantitative, precipitation, heavy, rain, heavy, snow, and, highlights, areas, with, the, potential, for, flash, flooding, typically, the, range, of, knowledge, that, is, required, overlaps, with, climatology, mesoscale, and, synoptic, meteorology, and, other, geosciences, the, multidisciplinary, nature, of, the, branch, can, result, in, technical, challenges, since, tools, and, solutions, from, each, of, the, individual, disciplines, involved, may, behave, slightly, differently, be, optimized, for, different, hard, and, software, platforms, and, use, different, data, formats, there, are, some, initiatives, such, as, the, drihm, project, that, are, trying, to, address, this, issue, nuclear, meteorology, investigates, the, distribution, of, radioactive, aerosols, and, gases, in, the, atmosphere, maritime, meteorology, deals, with, air, and, wave,
