in, the, field, of, optics, transparency, also, called, pellucidity, or, diaphaneity, is, the, physical, property, of, allowing, light, to, pass, through, the, material, without, appreciable, scattering, of, light, on, a, macroscopic, scale, one, in, which, the, dimensions, are, much, larger, than, the, wavelengths, of, the, photons, in, question, the, photons, can, be, said, to, follow, snell, s, law, translucency, also, called, translucence, or, translucidity, allows, light, to, pass, through, but, does, not, necessarily, again, on, the, macroscopic, scale, follow, snell, s, law, the, photons, can, be, scattered, at, either, of, the, two, interfaces, or, internally, where, there, is, a, change, in, the, index, of, refraction, in, other, words, a, translucent, material, is, made, up, of, components, with, different, indices, of, refraction, a, transparent, material, is, made, up, of, components, with, a, uniform, index, of, refraction, transparent, materials, appear, clear, with, the, overall, appearance, of, one, color, or, any, combination, leading, up, to, a, brilliant, spectrum, of, every, color, the, opposite, property, of, translucency, is, opacity, other, categories, of, visual, appearance, related, to, the, perception, of, regular, or, diffuse, reflection, and, transmission, of, light, have, been, organized, under, the, concept, of, cesia, in, an, order, system, with, three, variables, including, transparency, translucency, and, opacity, among, the, involved, aspects, when, light, encounters, a, material, it, can, interact, with, it, in, several, different, ways, these, interactions, depend, on, the, wavelength, of, the, light, and, the, nature, of, the, material, photons, interact, with, an, object, by, some, combination, of, reflection, absorption, and, transmission, some, materials, such, as, plate, glass, and, clean, water, transmit, much, of, the, light, that, falls, on, them, and, reflect, little, of, it, such, materials, are, called, optically, transparent, many, liquids, and, aqueous, solutions, are, highly, transparent, absence, of, structural, defects, voids, cracks, etc, and, molecular, structure, of, most, liquids, are, mostly, responsible, for, excellent, optical, transmission, materials, that, do, not, transmit, light, are, called, opaque, many, such, substances, have, a, chemical, composition, which, includes, what, are, referred, to, as, absorption, centers, many, substances, are, selective, in, their, absorption, of, white, light, frequencies, they, absorb, certain, portions, of, the, visible, spectrum, while, reflecting, others, the, frequencies, of, the, spectrum, which, are, not, absorbed, are, either, reflected, or, transmitted, for, our, physical, observation, this, is, what, gives, rise, to, color, the, attenuation, of, light, of, all, frequencies, and, wavelengths, is, due, to, the, combined, mechanisms, of, absorption, and, scattering, transparency, can, provide, almost, perfect, camouflage, for, animals, able, to, achieve, it, this, is, easier, in, dimly, lit, or, turbid, seawater, than, in, good, illumination, many, marine, animals, such, as, jellyfish, are, highly, transparent, with, regard, to, the, absorption, of, light, primary, material, considerations, include, with, regard, to, the, scattering, of, light, the, most, critical, factor, is, the, length, scale, of, any, or, all, of, these, structural, features, relative, to, the, wavelength, of, the, light, being, scattered, primary, material, considerations, include, diffuse, reflection, generally, when, light, strikes, the, surface, of, a, non, metallic, and, non, glassy, solid, material, it, bounces, off, in, all, directions, due, to, multiple, reflections, by, the, microscopic, irregularities, inside, the, material, e, g, the, grain, boundaries, of, a, polycrystalline, material, or, the, cell, or, fiber, boundaries, of, an, organic, material, and, by, its, surface, if, it, is, rough, diffuse, reflection, is, typically, characterized, by, omni, directional, reflection, angles, most, of, the, objects, visible, to, the, naked, eye, are, identified, via, diffuse, reflection, another, term, commonly, used, for, this, type, of, reflection, is, light, scattering, light, scattering, from, the, surfaces, of, objects, is, our, primary, mechanism, of, physical, observation, light, scattering, in, liquids, and, solids, depends, on, the, wavelength, of, the, light, being, scattered, limits, to, spatial, scales, of, visibility, using, white, light, therefore, arise, depending, on, the, frequency, of, the, light, wave, and, the, physical, dimension, or, spatial, scale, of, the, scattering, center, visible, light, has, a, wavelength, scale, on, the, order, of, a, half, a, micrometer, scattering, centers, or, particles, as, small, as, one, micrometer, have, been, observed, directly, in, the, light, microscope, e, g, brownian, motion, optical, transparency, in, polycrystalline, materials, is, limited, by, the, amount, of, light, scattered, by, their, microstructural, features, light, scattering, depends, on, the, wavelength, of, the, light, limits, to, spatial, scales, of, visibility, using, white, light, therefore, arise, depending, on, the, frequency, of, the, light, wave, and, the, physical, dimension, of, the, scattering, center, for, example, since, visible, light, has, a, wavelength, scale, on, the, order, of, a, micrometer, scattering, centers, will, have, dimensions, on, a, similar, spatial, scale, primary, scattering, centers, in, polycrystalline, materials, include, microstructural, defects, such, as, pores, and, grain, boundaries, in, addition, to, pores, most, of, the, interfaces, in, a, typical, metal, or, ceramic, object, are, in, the, form, of, grain, boundaries, which, separate, tiny, regions, of, crystalline, order, when, the, size, of, the, scattering, center, or, grain, boundary, is, reduced, below, the, size, of, the, wavelength, of, the, light, being, scattered, the, scattering, no, longer, occurs, to, any, significant, extent, in, the, formation, of, polycrystalline, materials, metals, and, ceramics, the, size, of, the, crystalline, grains, is, determined, largely, by, the, size, of, the, crystalline, particles, present, in, the, raw, material, during, formation, or, pressing, of, the, object, moreover, the, size, of, the, grain, boundaries, scales, directly, with, particle, size, thus, a, reduction, of, the, original, particle, size, well, below, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, about, 1, 15, of, the, light, wavelength, or, roughly, 600, 15, 40, nanometers, eliminates, much, of, the, light, scattering, resulting, in, a, translucent, or, even, transparent, material, computer, modeling, of, light, transmission, through, translucent, ceramic, alumina, has, shown, that, microscopic, pores, trapped, near, grain, boundaries, act, as, primary, scattering, centers, the, volume, fraction, of, porosity, had, to, be, reduced, below, 1, for, high, quality, optical, transmission, 99, 99, percent, of, theoretical, density, this, goal, has, been, readily, accomplished, and, amply, demonstrated, in, laboratories, and, research, facilities, worldwide, using, the, emerging, chemical, processing, methods, encompassed, by, the, methods, of, sol, gel, chemistry, and, nanotechnology, transparent, ceramics, have, created, interest, in, their, applications, for, high, energy, lasers, transparent, armor, windows, nose, cones, for, heat, seeking, missiles, radiation, detectors, for, non, destructive, testing, high, energy, physics, space, exploration, security, and, medical, imaging, applications, large, laser, elements, made, from, transparent, ceramics, can, be, produced, at, a, relatively, low, cost, these, components, are, free, of, internal, stress, or, intrinsic, birefringence, and, allow, relatively, large, doping, levels, or, optimized, custom, designed, doping, profiles, this, makes, ceramic, laser, elements, particularly, important, for, high, energy, lasers, the, development, of, transparent, panel, products, will, have, other, potential, advanced, applications, including, high, strength, impact, resistant, materials, that, can, be, used, for, domestic, windows, and, skylights, perhaps, more, important, is, that, walls, and, other, applications, will, have, improved, overall, strength, especially, for, high, shear, conditions, found, in, high, seismic, and, wind, exposures, if, the, expected, improvements, in, mechanical, properties, bear, out, the, traditional, limits, seen, on, glazing, areas, in, today, s, building, codes, could, quickly, become, outdated, if, the, window, area, actually, contributes, to, the, shear, resistance, of, the, wall, currently, available, infrared, transparent, materials, typically, exhibit, a, trade, off, between, optical, performance, mechanical, strength, and, price, for, example, sapphire, crystalline, alumina, is, very, strong, but, it, is, expensive, and, lacks, full, transparency, throughout, the, 3, 5, micrometer, mid, infrared, range, yttria, is, fully, transparent, from, 3, 5, micrometers, but, lacks, sufficient, strength, hardness, and, thermal, shock, resistance, for, high, performance, aerospace, applications, a, combination, of, these, two, materials, in, the, form, of, the, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, yag, is, one, of, the, top, performers, in, the, field, when, light, strikes, an, object, it, usually, has, not, just, a, single, frequency, or, wavelength, but, many, objects, have, a, tendency, to, selectively, absorb, reflect, or, transmit, light, of, certain, frequencies, that, is, one, object, might, reflect, green, light, while, absorbing, all, other, frequencies, of, visible, light, another, object, might, selectively, transmit, blue, light, while, absorbing, all, other, frequencies, of, visible, light, the, manner, in, which, visible, light, interacts, with, an, object, is, dependent, upon, the, frequency, of, the, light, the, nature, of, the, atoms, in, the, object, and, often, the, nature, of, the, electrons, in, the, atoms, of, the, object, some, materials, allow, much, of, the, light, that, falls, on, them, to, be, transmitted, through, the, material, without, being, reflected, materials, that, allow, the, transmission, of, light, waves, through, them, are, called, optically, transparent, chemically, pure, undoped, window, glass, and, clean, river, or, spring, water, are, prime, examples, of, this, materials, that, do, not, allow, the, transmission, of, any, light, wave, frequencies, are, called, opaque, such, substances, may, have, a, chemical, composition, which, includes, what, are, referred, to, as, absorption, centers, most, materials, are, composed, of, materials, that, are, selective, in, their, absorption, of, light, frequencies, thus, they, absorb, only, certain, portions, of, the, visible, spectrum, the, frequencies, of, the, spectrum, which, are, not, absorbed, are, either, reflected, back, or, transmitted, for, our, physical, observation, in, the, visible, portion, of, the, spectrum, this, is, what, gives, rise, to, color, absorption, centers, are, largely, responsible, for, the, appearance, of, specific, wavelengths, of, visible, light, all, around, us, moving, from, longer, 0, 7, micrometers, to, shorter, 0, 4, micrometers, wavelengths, red, orange, yellow, green, and, blue, roygb, can, all, be, identified, by, our, senses, in, the, appearance, of, color, by, the, selective, absorption, of, specific, light, wave, frequencies, or, wavelengths, mechanisms, of, selective, light, wave, absorption, include, in, electronic, absorption, the, frequency, of, the, incoming, light, wave, is, at, or, near, the, energy, levels, of, the, electrons, within, the, atoms, that, compose, the, substance, in, this, case, the, electrons, will, absorb, the, energy, of, the, light, wave, and, increase, their, energy, state, often, moving, outward, from, the, nucleus, of, the, atom, into, an, outer, shell, or, orbital, the, atoms, that, bind, together, to, make, the, molecules, of, any, particular, substance, contain, a, number, of, electrons, given, by, the, atomic, number, z, in, the, periodic, table, recall, that, all, light, waves, are, electromagnetic, in, origin, thus, they, are, affected, strongly, when, coming, into, contact, with, negatively, charged, electrons, in, matter, when, photons, individual, packets, of, light, energy, come, in, contact, with, the, valence, electrons, of, an, atom, one, of, several, things, can, and, will, occur, most, of, the, time, it, is, a, combination, of, the, above, that, happens, to, the, light, that, hits, an, object, the, states, in, different, materials, vary, in, the, range, of, energy, that, they, can, absorb, most, glasses, for, example, block, ultraviolet, uv, light, what, happens, is, the, electrons, in, the, glass, absorb, the, energy, of, the, photons, in, the, uv, range, while, ignoring, the, weaker, energy, of, photons, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, but, there, are, also, existing, special, glass, types, like, special, types, of, borosilicate, glass, or, quartz, that, are, uv, permeable, and, thus, allow, a, high, transmission, of, ultraviolet, light, thus, when, a, material, is, illuminated, individual, photons, of, light, can, make, the, valence, electrons, of, an, atom, transition, to, a, higher, electronic, energy, level, the, photon, is, destroyed, in, the, process, and, the, absorbed, radiant, energy, is, transformed, to, electric, potential, energy, several, things, can, happen, then, to, the, absorbed, energy, it, may, be, re, emitted, by, the, electron, as, radiant, energy, in, this, case, the, overall, effect, is, in, fact, a, scattering, of, light, dissipated, to, the, rest, of, the, material, i, e, transformed, into, heat, or, the, electron, can, be, freed, from, the, atom, as, in, the, photoelectric, effects, and, compton, effects, the, primary, physical, mechanism, for, storing, mechanical, energy, of, motion, in, condensed, matter, is, through, heat, or, thermal, energy, thermal, energy, manifests, itself, as, energy, of, motion, thus, heat, is, motion, at, the, atomic, and, molecular, levels, the, primary, mode, of, motion, in, crystalline, substances, is, vibration, any, given, atom, will, vibrate, around, some, mean, or, average, position, within, a, crystalline, structure, surrounded, by, its, nearest, neighbors, this, vibration, in, two, dimensions, is, equivalent, to, the, oscillation, of, a, clock, s, pendulum, it, swings, back, and, forth, symmetrically, about, some, mean, or, average, vertical, position, atomic, and, molecular, vibrational, frequencies, may, average, on, the, order, of, 10, 12, cycles, per, second, terahertz, radiation, when, a, light, wave, of, a, given, frequency, strikes, a, material, with, particles, having, the, same, or, resonant, vibrational, frequencies, those, particles, will, absorb, the, energy, of, the, light, wave, and, transform, it, into, thermal, energy, of, vibrational, motion, since, different, atoms, and, molecules, have, different, natural, frequencies, of, vibration, they, will, selectively, absorb, different, frequencies, or, portions, of, the, spectrum, of, infrared, light, reflection, and, transmission, of, light, waves, occur, because, the, frequencies, of, the, light, waves, do, not, match, the, natural, resonant, frequencies, of, vibration, of, the, objects, when, infrared, light, of, these, frequencies, strikes, an, object, the, energy, is, reflected, or, transmitted, if, the, object, is, transparent, then, the, light, waves, are, passed, on, to, neighboring, atoms, through, the, bulk, of, the, material, and, re, emitted, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, object, such, frequencies, of, light, waves, are, said, to, be, transmitted, an, object, may, be, not, transparent, either, because, it, reflects, the, incoming, light, or, because, it, absorbs, the, incoming, light, almost, all, solids, reflect, a, part, and, absorb, a, part, of, the, incoming, light, when, light, falls, onto, a, block, of, metal, it, encounters, atoms, that, are, tightly, packed, in, a, regular, lattice, and, a, sea, of, electrons, moving, randomly, between, the, atoms, in, metals, most, of, these, are, non, bonding, electrons, or, free, electrons, as, opposed, to, the, bonding, electrons, typically, found, in, covalently, bonded, or, ionically, bonded, non, metallic, insulating, solids, in, a, metallic, bond, any, potential, bonding, electrons, can, easily, be, lost, by, the, atoms, in, a, crystalline, structure, the, effect, of, this, delocalization, is, simply, to, exaggerate, the, effect, of, the, sea, of, electrons, as, a, result, of, these, electrons, most, of, the, incoming, light, in, metals, is, reflected, back, which, is, why, we, see, a, shiny, metal, surface, most, insulators, or, dielectric, materials, are, held, together, by, ionic, bonds, thus, these, materials, do, not, have, free, conduction, electrons, and, the, bonding, electrons, reflect, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, incident, wave, the, remaining, frequencies, or, wavelengths, are, free, to, propagate, or, be, transmitted, this, class, of, materials, includes, all, ceramics, and, glasses, if, a, dielectric, material, does, not, include, light, absorbent, additive, molecules, pigments, dyes, colorants, it, is, usually, transparent, to, the, spectrum, of, visible, light, color, centers, or, dye, molecules, or, dopants, in, a, dielectric, absorb, a, portion, of, the, incoming, light, the, remaining, frequencies, or, wavelengths, are, free, to, be, reflected, or, transmitted, this, is, how, colored, glass, is, produced, most, liquids, and, aqueous, solutions, are, highly, transparent, for, example, water, cooking, oil, rubbing, alcohol, air, and, natural, gas, are, all, clear, absence, of, structural, defects, voids, cracks, etc, and, molecular, structure, of, most, liquids, are, chiefly, responsible, for, their, excellent, optical, transmission, the, ability, of, liquids, to, heal, internal, defects, via, viscous, flow, is, one, of, the, reasons, why, some, fibrous, materials, e, g, paper, or, fabric, increase, their, apparent, transparency, when, wetted, the, liquid, fills, up, numerous, voids, making, the, material, more, structurally, homogeneous, light, scattering, in, an, ideal, defect, free, crystalline, non, metallic, solid, that, provides, no, scattering, centers, for, incoming, light, will, be, due, primarily, to, any, effects, of, anharmonicity, within, the, ordered, lattice, light, transmission, will, be, highly, directional, due, to, the, typical, anisotropy, of, crystalline, substances, which, includes, their, symmetry, group, and, bravais, lattice, for, example, the, seven, different, crystalline, forms, of, quartz, silica, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, are, all, clear, transparent, materials, optically, transparent, materials, focus, on, the, response, of, a, material, to, incoming, light, waves, of, a, range, of, wavelengths, guided, light, wave, transmission, via, frequency, selective, waveguides, involves, the, emerging, field, of, fiber, optics, and, the, ability, of, certain, glassy, compositions, to, act, as, a, transmission, medium, for, a, range, of, frequencies, simultaneously, multi, mode, optical, fiber, with, little, or, no, interference, between, competing, wavelengths, or, frequencies, this, resonant, mode, of, energy, and, data, transmission, via, electromagnetic, light, wave, propagation, is, relatively, lossless, an, optical, fiber, is, a, cylindrical, dielectric, waveguide, that, transmits, light, along, its, axis, by, the, process, of, total, internal, reflection, the, fiber, consists, of, a, core, surrounded, by, a, cladding, layer, to, confine, the, optical, signal, in, the, core, the, refractive, index, of, the, core, must, be, greater, than, that, of, the, cladding, the, refractive, index, is, the, parameter, reflecting, the, speed, of, light, in, a, material, refractive, index, is, the, ratio, of, the, speed, of, light, in, a, vacuum, to, the, speed, of, light, in, a, given, medium, the, refractive, index, of, vacuum, is, therefore, 1, the, larger, the, refractive, index, the, more, slowly, light, travels, in, that, medium, typical, values, for, core, and, cladding, of, an, optical, fiber, are, 1, 48, and, 1, 46, respectively, when, light, traveling, in, a, dense, medium, hits, a, boundary, at, a, steep, angle, the, light, will, be, completely, reflected, this, effect, called, total, internal, reflection, is, used, in, optical, fibers, to, confine, light, in, the, core, light, travels, along, the, fiber, bouncing, back, and, forth, off, of, the, boundary, because, the, light, must, strike, the, boundary, with, an, angle, greater, than, the, critical, angle, only, light, that, enters, the, fiber, within, a, certain, range, of, angles, will, be, propagated, this, range, of, angles, is, called, the, acceptance, cone, of, the, fiber, the, size, of, this, acceptance, cone, is, a, function, of, the, refractive, index, difference, between, the, fiber, s, core, and, cladding, optical, waveguides, are, used, as, components, in, integrated, optical, circuits, e, g, combined, with, lasers, or, light, emitting, diodes, leds, or, as, the, transmission, medium, in, local, and, long, haul, optical, communication, systems, attenuation, in, fiber, optics, also, known, as, transmission, loss, is, the, reduction, in, intensity, of, the, light, beam, or, signal, with, respect, to, distance, traveled, through, a, transmission, medium, it, is, an, important, factor, limiting, the, transmission, of, a, signal, across, large, distances, attenuation, coefficients, in, fiber, optics, usually, use, units, of, db, km, through, the, medium, due, to, the, very, high, quality, of, transparency, of, modern, optical, transmission, media, the, medium, is, usually, a, fiber, of, silica, glass, that, confines, the, incident, light, beam, to, the, inside, in, optical, fibers, the, main, source, of, attenuation, is, scattering, from, molecular, level, irregularities, called, rayleigh, scattering, due, to, structural, disorder, and, compositional, fluctuations, of, the, glass, structure, this, same, phenomenon, is, seen, as, one, of, the, limiting, factors, in, the, transparency, of, infrared, missile, domes, further, attenuation, is, caused, by, light, absorbed, by, residual, materials, such, as, metals, or, water, ions, within, the, fiber, core, and, inner, cladding, light, leakage, due, to, bending, splices, connectors, or, other, outside, forces, are, other, factors, resulting, in, attenuation, at, high, optical, powers, scattering, can, also, be, caused, by, nonlinear, optical, processes, in, the, fiber, many, marine, animals, that, float, near, the, surface, are, highly, transparent, giving, them, almost, perfect, camouflage, however, transparency, is, difficult, for, bodies, made, of, materials, that, have, different, refractive, indices, from, seawater, some, marine, animals, such, as, jellyfish, have, gelatinous, bodies, composed, mainly, of, water, their, thick, mesogloea, is, acellular, and, highly, transparent, this, conveniently, makes, them, buoyant, but, it, also, makes, them, large, for, their, muscle, mass, so, they, cannot, swim, fast, making, this, form, of, camouflage, a, costly, trade, off, with, mobility, gelatinous, planktonic, animals, are, between, 50, and, 90, percent, transparent, a, transparency, of, 50, percent, is, enough, to, make, an, animal, invisible, to, a, predator, such, as, cod, at, a, depth, of, 650, metres, 2, 130, ft, better, transparency, is, required, for, invisibility, in, shallower, water, where, the, light, is, brighter, and, predators, can, see, better, for, example, a, cod, can, see, prey, that, are, 98, percent, transparent, in, optimal, lighting, in, shallow, water, therefore, sufficient, transparency, for, camouflage, is, more, easily, achieved, in, deeper, waters, for, the, same, reason, transparency, in, air, is, even, harder, to, achieve, but, a, partial, example, is, found, in, the, glass, frogs, of, the, south, american, rain, forest, which, have, translucent, skin, and, pale, greenish, limbs, several, central, american, species, of, clearwing, ithomiine, butterflies, and, many, dragonflies, and, allied, insects, also, have, wings, which, are, mostly, transparent, a, form, of, crypsis, that, provides, some, protection, from, predators
