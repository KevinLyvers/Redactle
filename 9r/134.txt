the, whirlpool, galaxy, also, known, as, messier, 51a, m51a, or, ngc, 5194, is, an, interacting, grand, design, spiral, galaxy, with, a, seyfert, 2, active, galactic, nucleus, it, lies, in, the, constellation, canes, venatici, and, was, the, first, galaxy, to, be, classified, as, a, spiral, galaxy, it, is, 7, 22, megaparsecs, 23, 5, million, light, years, away, and, 23, 58, kiloparsecs, 76, 900, ly, in, diameter, the, galaxy, and, its, companion, ngc, 5195, are, easily, observed, by, amateur, astronomers, and, the, two, galaxies, may, be, seen, with, binoculars, the, whirlpool, galaxy, has, been, extensively, observed, by, professional, astronomers, who, study, it, and, its, pair, with, ngc, 5195, to, understand, galaxy, structure, particularly, structure, associated, with, the, spiral, arms, and, galaxy, interactions, its, pair, with, ngc, 5195, is, among, the, most, famous, and, relatively, close, interacting, systems, and, thus, is, a, favorite, subject, of, galaxy, interaction, models, what, later, became, known, as, the, whirlpool, galaxy, was, discovered, on, october, 13, 1773, by, charles, messier, while, hunting, for, objects, that, could, confuse, comet, hunters, and, was, designated, in, messier, s, catalogue, as, m51, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, employing, a, 72, inch, 1, 8, m, reflecting, telescope, at, birr, castle, ireland, found, that, the, whirlpool, possessed, a, spiral, structure, the, first, nebula, to, be, known, to, have, one, these, spiral, nebulae, were, not, recognized, as, galaxies, until, edwin, hubble, was, able, to, observe, cepheid, variables, in, some, of, these, spiral, nebulae, which, provided, evidence, that, they, were, so, far, away, that, they, must, be, entirely, separate, galaxies, the, advent, of, radio, astronomy, and, subsequent, radio, images, of, m51, unequivocally, demonstrated, that, the, whirlpool, and, its, companion, galaxy, are, indeed, interacting, sometimes, the, designation, m51, is, used, to, refer, to, the, pair, of, galaxies, in, which, case, the, individual, galaxies, may, be, referred, to, as, m51a, ngc, 5194, and, m51b, ngc, 5195, deep, in, the, constellation, canes, venatici, m51, is, often, found, by, finding, the, easternmost, star, of, the, big, dipper, alkaid, and, going, 3, 5, southwest, its, declination, is, rounded, 47, making, it, circumpolar, never, setting, for, observers, above, the, 43rd, parallel, north, it, reaches, a, high, altitude, throughout, this, hemisphere, making, it, an, accessible, object, from, the, early, hours, in, november, through, to, the, end, of, may, after, which, observation, is, more, coincidental, in, modest, latitudes, with, the, risen, sun, due, to, the, sun, approaching, to, and, receding, from, its, right, ascension, specifically, figuring, in, gemini, just, to, the, north, m51, is, visible, through, binoculars, under, dark, sky, conditions, and, it, can, be, resolved, in, detail, with, modern, amateur, telescopes, when, seen, through, a, 100, mm, telescope, the, basic, outlines, of, m51, limited, to, 5, 6, and, its, companion, are, visible, under, dark, skies, and, with, a, moderate, eyepiece, through, a, 150, mm, telescope, m51, s, intrinsic, spiral, structure, can, be, detected, with, larger, 300, mm, instruments, under, dark, sky, conditions, the, various, spiral, bands, are, apparent, with, hii, regions, visible, and, m51, can, be, seen, to, be, attached, to, m51b, as, is, usual, for, galaxies, the, true, extent, of, its, structure, can, only, be, gathered, from, inspecting, photographs, long, exposures, reveal, a, large, nebula, extending, beyond, the, visible, circular, appearance, in, 1984, thanks, to, the, high, speed, detector, the, so, called, image, photon, counting, ipcs, system, developed, jointly, by, the, cnrs, laboratoire, d, astronomie, spatiald, l, a, s, cnrs, and, the, observatoire, de, haute, provence, o, h, p, along, with, the, particularly, nice, seeing, offered, by, the, canada, france, hawaii, telescope, c, f, h, t, 3, 60m, cassegrain, focus, at, mauna, kea, summit, in, hawaii, hua, et, al, detected, the, double, component, of, the, very, nucleus, of, the, whirlpool, galaxy, in, january, 2005, the, hubble, heritage, project, constructed, a, 11, 477, 7, 965, pixel, composite, image, shown, in, the, infobox, above, of, m51, using, hubble, s, acs, instrument, the, image, highlights, the, galaxy, s, spiral, arms, and, shows, detail, into, some, of, the, structures, inside, the, arms, the, whirlpool, galaxy, lies, at, a, distance, of, about, 23, to, 31, million, light, years, from, earth, based, on, the, 1991, measurement, by, the, third, reference, catalogue, of, bright, galaxies, using, the, d, 25, isophote, at, the, b, band, the, whirlpool, galaxy, has, a, diameter, of, 23, 58, kiloparsecs, 76, 900, light, years, overall, the, galaxy, is, about, 88, the, size, of, the, milky, way, its, mass, is, estimated, to, be, 160, billion, solar, masses, or, around, 10, 3, of, the, mass, of, milky, way, galaxy, a, black, hole, once, thought, to, be, surrounded, by, a, ring, of, dust, but, now, believed, to, be, partially, occluded, by, dust, instead, exists, at, the, heart, of, the, spiral, a, pair, of, ionization, cones, extend, from, the, active, galactic, nucleus, the, whirlpool, galaxy, has, two, very, prominent, spiral, arms, that, wind, clockwise, one, arm, deviates, from, a, constant, angle, significantly, the, pronounced, spiral, structure, of, the, whirlpool, galaxy, is, believed, to, be, the, result, of, the, close, interaction, between, it, and, its, companion, galaxy, ngc, 5195, which, may, have, passed, through, the, main, disk, of, m51, about, 500, to, 600, million, years, ago, in, this, proposed, scenario, ngc, 5195, came, from, behind, m51, through, the, disk, towards, the, observer, and, made, another, disk, crossing, as, recently, as, 50, to, 100, million, years, ago, until, it, is, where, we, observe, it, to, be, now, slightly, behind, m51, as, a, result, of, the, whirpool, galaxy, s, interaction, with, ngc, 5195, a, variety, of, tidal, features, have, been, created, the, largest, of, these, features, is, the, so, called, northwest, plume, which, extends, out, to, 43, kiloparsecs, 140, 000, light, years, from, the, galaxy, s, center, this, plume, is, uniform, in, color, and, likely, originated, from, the, whirpool, galaxy, itself, due, to, having, diffuse, gas, adjacent, to, it, are, two, other, plumes, that, have, a, slightly, bluer, color, referred, to, as, the, western, plumes, due, to, their, location, in, 2015, a, study, discovered, two, new, tidal, features, caused, by, the, interaction, between, the, whirlpool, galaxy, and, ngc, 5195, the, northeast, plume, and, the, south, plume, the, study, remarks, that, a, simulation, that, takes, into, account, only, one, passage, of, ngc, 5195, into, the, whirpool, galaxy, will, fail, to, produce, an, analogue, to, the, northeast, tail, in, contrast, the, multiple, passage, simulations, made, by, salo, and, laurikainen, et, al, reproduce, the, northeast, plume, the, central, region, of, m51, appears, to, be, undergoing, a, period, of, enhanced, star, formation, the, present, efficiency, of, star, formation, defined, as, the, ratio, of, mass, of, new, stars, to, the, mass, of, star, forming, gas, is, only, 1, quite, comparable, to, the, global, value, for, the, milky, way, and, other, galaxies, it, is, estimated, that, the, current, high, rate, of, star, formation, can, last, no, more, than, another, 100, million, years, or, so, similarly, the, spiral, arms, are, experiencing, high, levels, of, star, formation, as, well, as, the, space, along, the, arms, three, supernovae, have, been, observed, in, the, whirlpool, galaxy, in, 1994, sn, 1994i, was, observed, in, the, whirlpool, galaxy, it, was, classified, as, type, ic, indicating, that, its, progenitor, star, was, very, massive, and, had, already, shed, much, of, its, mass, and, its, brightness, peaked, at, apparent, magnitude, 12, 91, in, june, 2005, the, type, ii, supernova, sn, 2005cs, was, observed, in, the, whirlpool, galaxy, peaking, at, apparent, magnitude, 14, on, 31, may, 2011, a, type, ii, supernova, was, detected, in, the, whirlpool, galaxy, peaking, at, magnitude, 12, 1, this, supernova, designated, sn, 2011dh, showed, a, spectrum, much, bluer, than, average, with, p, cygni, profiles, which, indicate, rapidly, expanding, material, in, its, hydrogen, balmer, lines, the, progenitor, was, probably, a, yellow, supergiant, and, not, a, red, or, blue, supergiant, which, are, thought, to, be, the, most, common, supernova, progenitors, on, 22, january, 2019, a, supernova, impostor, designated, at, 2019abn, was, discovered, in, messier, 51, the, transient, was, later, identified, as, a, luminous, red, nova, the, progenitor, star, was, detected, in, archival, spitzer, space, telescope, infrared, images, no, object, could, be, seen, at, the, position, of, the, transient, in, archival, hubble, images, indicating, that, the, progenitor, star, was, heavily, obstructed, by, interstellar, dust, 2019abn, peaked, at, magnitude, 17, reaching, an, intrinsic, brightness, of, m, r, 14, 9, displaystyle, m, r, 14, 9, in, september, 2020, the, detection, by, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, of, a, candidate, exoplanet, named, m51, uls, 1b, orbiting, the, high, mass, x, ray, binary, m51, uls, 1, in, this, galaxy, was, announced, if, confirmed, it, would, be, the, first, known, instance, of, an, extragalactic, planet, a, planet, outside, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, planet, candidate, was, detected, by, eclipses, of, the, x, ray, source, xrs, which, consists, of, a, stellar, remnant, either, a, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, and, a, massive, star, likely, a, b, type, supergiant, the, planet, would, be, slightly, smaller, than, saturn, and, orbit, at, a, distance, of, some, tens, of, astronomical, units, ngc, 5195, also, known, as, messier, 51b, or, m51b, is, a, dwarf, galaxy, that, is, interacting, with, the, whirlpool, galaxy, also, known, as, m51a, or, ngc, 5194, both, galaxies, are, located, approximately, 25, million, light, years, away, in, the, constellation, canes, venatici, together, the, two, galaxies, are, one, of, the, most, widely, studied, interacting, galaxy, pairs, the, whirlpool, galaxy, is, the, brightest, galaxy, in, the, m51, group, a, small, group, of, galaxies, that, also, includes, m63, the, sunflower, galaxy, ngc, 5023, and, ngc, 5229, this, small, group, may, actually, be, a, subclump, at, the, southeast, end, of, a, large, elongated, group, that, includes, the, m101, group, and, the, ngc, 5866, group, although, most, group, identification, methods, and, catalogs, identify, the, three, groups, as, separate, entities
