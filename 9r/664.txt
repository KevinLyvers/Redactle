an, artificial, island, or, man, made, island, is, an, island, that, has, been, constructed, by, humans, rather, than, formed, through, natural, processes, other, definitions, may, suggest, that, artificial, islands, are, lands, with, the, characteristics, of, human, intervention, in, their, format, process, while, others, argue, that, artificial, islands, are, created, by, expanding, existing, islets, constructing, on, existing, reefs, or, amalgamating, several, islets, together, although, constructing, artificial, islands, is, not, a, modern, phenomenon, there, is, no, definite, legal, definition, of, it, artificial, islands, may, vary, in, size, from, small, islets, reclaimed, solely, to, support, a, single, pillar, of, a, building, or, structure, to, those, that, support, entire, communities, and, cities, archaeologists, argue, that, such, islands, were, created, as, far, back, as, the, neolithic, era, early, artificial, islands, included, floating, structures, in, still, waters, or, wooden, or, megalithic, structures, erected, in, shallow, waters, e, g, crann, gs, and, nan, madol, discussed, below, in, modern, times, artificial, islands, are, usually, formed, by, land, reclamation, but, some, are, formed, by, flooding, of, valleys, resulting, in, the, tops, of, former, knolls, getting, isolated, by, water, e, g, barro, colorado, island, there, are, several, reasons, for, the, construction, of, these, islands, which, include, residential, industrial, commercial, structural, for, bridge, pylons, or, strategic, purposes, one, of, the, world, s, largest, artificial, islands, ren, levasseur, island, was, formed, by, the, flooding, of, two, adjacent, reservoirs, technological, advancements, have, made, it, feasible, to, build, artificial, islands, in, waters, as, deep, as, 75, meters, the, size, of, the, waves, and, the, structural, integrity, of, the, island, play, a, crucial, role, in, determining, the, maximum, depth, despite, a, popular, image, of, modernity, artificial, islands, actually, have, a, long, history, in, many, parts, of, the, world, dating, back, to, the, reclaimed, islands, of, ancient, egyptian, civilization, the, stilt, crannogs, of, prehistoric, wales, scotland, and, ireland, the, ceremonial, centers, of, nan, madol, in, micronesia, and, the, still, extant, floating, islands, of, lake, titicaca, the, city, of, tenochtitlan, the, aztec, predecessor, of, mexico, city, that, was, home, to, 500, 000, people, when, the, spaniards, arrived, stood, on, a, small, natural, island, in, lake, texcoco, that, was, surrounded, by, countless, artificial, chinamitl, islands, the, people, of, langa, langa, lagoon, and, lau, lagoon, in, malaita, solomon, islands, built, about, 60, artificial, islands, on, the, reef, including, funaafou, sulufou, and, adaege, the, people, of, lau, lagoon, build, islands, on, the, reef, as, this, provided, protection, against, attack, from, the, people, who, lived, in, the, centre, of, malaita, these, islands, were, formed, literally, one, rock, at, a, time, a, family, would, take, their, canoe, out, to, the, reef, which, protects, the, lagoon, and, then, dive, for, rocks, bring, them, to, the, surface, and, then, return, to, the, selected, site, and, drop, the, rocks, into, the, water, living, on, the, reef, was, also, healthier, as, the, mosquitoes, which, infested, the, coastal, swamps, were, not, found, on, the, reef, islands, the, lau, people, continue, to, live, on, the, reef, islands, many, artificial, islands, have, been, built, in, urban, harbors, to, provide, either, a, site, deliberately, isolated, from, the, city, or, just, spare, real, estate, otherwise, unobtainable, in, a, crowded, metropolis, an, example, of, the, first, case, is, dejima, or, deshima, created, in, the, bay, of, nagasaki, in, japan, s, edo, period, as, a, contained, center, for, european, merchants, during, the, isolationist, era, dutch, people, were, generally, banned, from, nagasaki, and, japanese, from, dejima, similarly, ellis, island, in, upper, new, york, bay, beside, new, york, city, a, former, tiny, islet, greatly, expanded, by, land, reclamation, served, as, an, isolated, immigration, center, for, the, united, states, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, preventing, an, escape, to, the, city, of, those, refused, entry, for, disease, or, other, perceived, flaws, who, might, otherwise, be, tempted, toward, illegal, immigration, one, of, the, most, well, known, artificial, islands, is, the, le, notre, dame, in, montreal, built, for, expo, 67, the, venetian, islands, in, miami, beach, florida, in, biscayne, bay, added, valuable, new, real, estate, during, the, florida, land, boom, of, the, 1920s, when, the, bubble, that, the, developers, were, riding, burst, the, bay, was, left, scarred, with, the, remnants, of, their, failed, project, a, boom, town, development, company, was, building, a, sea, wall, for, an, island, that, was, to, be, called, isola, di, lolando, but, could, not, stay, in, business, after, the, 1926, miami, hurricane, and, the, great, depression, dooming, the, island, building,

international, airport, dalian, jinzhouwan, international, airport, being, built, on, a, 21, square, kilometer, artificial, island, xiamen, xiang, an, international, airport, sanya, hongtangwan, international, airport, designed, by, bentley, systems, which, is, being, built, on, a, 28, square, kilometer, artificial, islands, artificial, islands, negatively, impact, the, marine, environment, the, large, quantities, of, sand, required, to, build, these, islands, are, acquired, through, dredging, which, is, harmful, to, coral, reefs, and, disrupts, marine, life, the, increased, amount, of, sand, sediment, and, fine, particles, creates, turbid, conditions, blocking, necessary, uv, rays, from, reaching, coral, reefs, creating, coral, turbidity, where, more, organic, material, is, taken, in, by, coral, and, increasing, bacterial, activity, more, harmful, bacteria, are, introduced, into, coral, the, construction, of, artificial, islands, also, decreases, the, subaqueous, area, in, surrounding, waters, leading, to, habitat, destruction, or, degradation, for, many, species, under, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, treaty, unclos, artificial, islands, are, not, considered, harbor, works, article, 11, and, are, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, nearest, coastal, state, if, within, 200, nautical, miles, 370, km, article, 56, artificial, islands, are, also, not, considered, islands, for, purposes, of, having, their, own, territorial, waters, or, exclusive, economic, zones, and, only, the, coastal, state, may, authorize, their, construction, article, 60, however, on, the, high, seas, beyond, national, jurisdiction, any, state, may, construct, artificial, islands, article, 87, the, unrecognised, micronation, known, as, the, principality, of, sealand, often, shorted, to, simply, sealand, is, entirely, on, a, single, artificial, island, over, time, after, world, war, ii, several, countries, have, been, reported, to, have, built, artificial, islands, for, strategic, and, military, purposes, for, instance, the, philippines, and, china, have, been, reported, to, have, constructed, artificial, islands, in, the, south, china, sea, primarily, to, assert, territorial, claims, over, the, disputed, waters, similarly, russia, has, allegedly, done, so, in, the, arctic, both, for, strategic, and, military, purposes, these, reports, are, subject, to, ongoing, political, and, diplomatic, debates, the, island, building, activities, of, china, have, been, the, subject, of, close, examination, by, experts, who, suggest, that, they, are, driven, by, strategic, objectives, the, issue, at, the, heart, of, the, matter, revolves, around, china, s, claim, that, its, historical, entitlement, justifies, its, actions, in, the, area, this, is, opposed, by, the, legal, argument, supported, by, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, unclos, it, is, noteworthy, that, unclos, serves, as, the, primary, legal, framework, that, governs, the, use, and, control, of, maritime, zones, this, convention, establishes, regulations, on, how, coastal, states, can, exercise, their, sovereignty, over, territorial, waters, contiguous, zones, exclusive, economic, zones, eezs, and, the, continental, shelf, china, s, claim, to, the, south, china, sea, dates, back, to, the, 1940s, at, that, time, china, recovered, islands, in, the, name, of, the, cairo, declaration, and, the, potsdam, proclamation, and, there, was, no, reaction, from, vietnam, or, any, other, state, against, it, in, 1947, china, drafted, the, eleven, dash, line, also, referred, to, as, the, nine, dash, line, to, outline, the, geographical, scope, of, its, authority, over, the, south, china, sea, china, began, building, islands, in, the, 1980s, initially, creating, a, series, of, minor, military, garrisons, however, the, reason, why, china, faces, criticism, is, because, some, of, the, reclaimed, islands, fall, within, the, eezs, of, other, countries, which, raises, concerns, about, china, s, compliance, with, unclos, vietnam, has, also, made, a, historical, claim, pointing, to, its, rule, over, the, islands, in, the, 17th, century, the, philippines, argues, for, its, rights, based, on, geographical, proximity, meanwhile, malaysia, and, brunei, claim, parts, of, the, sea, using, eez, as, the, basis, of, their, claims, unclos, article, 60, stipulates, that, naturally, formed, islands, can, generate, eezs, while, artificial, islands, cannot, therefore, china, s, construction, of, artificial, islands, raises, questions, about, whether, they, can, legitimately, claim, an, eez, around, those, islands, unclos, also, enshrines, the, freedom, of, navigation, and, overflight, in, the, eez, of, coastal, states, which, implies, that, all, countries, have, the, right, to, sail, fly, and, conduct, military, exercises, in, those, waters, nevertheless, china, has, repeatedly, challenged, this, principle, by, constructing, artificial, islands, imposing, restrictions, on, navigation, and, militarising, the, area, the, legal, implications, surrounding, china, s, island, construction, efforts, present, complex, challenges, a, key, issue, revolves, around, determining, the, classification, of, land, masses, as, either, rocks, or, seabed, which, holds, significant, importance, in, these, disputed, cases, maritime, law, establishes, a, clear, distinction, between, land, masses, eligible, for, expansion, into, new, island, groups, and, those, that, do, not, qualify, according, to, this, legal, framework, low, tide, elevations, are, considered, part, of, the, seabed, and, do, not, generate, a, territorial, sea, eez, or, continental, shelf, however, they, serve, as, a, reference, point, for, measuring, the, entitlements, of, nearby, rocks, or, islands, rocks, unlike, islands, lack, the, capacity, to, sustain, human, habitation, or, support, economic, activity, while, they, generate, a, territorial, sea, they, do, not, establish, an, eez, or, continental, shelf, unclos, stipulates, that, both, rocks, and, islands, must, be, naturally, formed, and, remain, above, water, at, high, tide, the, spratly, islands, have, been, a, subject, of, contention, among, multiple, countries, including, taiwan, vietnam, the, philippines, malaysia, brunei, and, china, china, s, claim, to, the, islands, despite, entering, the, dispute, relatively, late, has, been, supported, by, arguments, asserting, historical, presence, and, construction, activities, on, the, islands, as, a, basis, for, their, claim, in, terms, of, international, law, land, reclamation, itself, is, not, explicitly, prohibited, there, is, no, specific, rule, within, international, law, that, prohibits, any, country, from, engaging, in, land, reclamation, at, sea, the, legality, of, such, activities, primarily, depends, on, their, location, in, relation, to, adjacent, land, territories, within, the, 12, nautical, mile, territorial, sea, a, country, holds, the, right, to, reclaim, land, as, it, falls, under, its, sovereign, authority, however, beyond, this, 12, nautical, mile, limit, the, country, must, consider, whether, its, actions, conform, to, the, rights, and, jurisdictions, recognised, by, unclos, reclamation, activities, conducted, between, 12, and, 200, nautical, miles, are, considered, part, of, the, process, of, establishing, and, utilising, artificial, islands, installations, and, structures, governed, by, specific, provisions, within, unclos, it, is, worth, mentioning, that, artificial, islands, may, include, stationary, oil, rigs, coastal, states, are, permitted, to, undertake, reclamation, within, designated, areas, as, long, as, they, fulfil, their, obligation, to, inform, other, countries, and, respect, their, rights, as, outlined, by, unclos, rules, however, any, artificial, islands, created, through, this, process, are, restricted, to, maintaining, a, 500, meter, safety, zone, around, them, and, must, not, obstruct, international, navigation, hybrid, warfare, is, understood, as, a, form, of, conflict, that, combines, conventional, and, irregular, tactics, hybrid, warfare, may, also, be, defined, as, a, multifaceted, strategy, aimed, at, destabilising, a, functioning, state, and, dividing, its, society, this, comprehensive, definition, portrays, hybrid, strategy, as, a, versatile, and, complex, approach, utilising, a, combination, of, conventional, and, unconventional, means, overt, and, covert, activities, involving, military, paramilitary, irregular, and, civilian, actors, across, different, domains, of, power, the, ultimate, objective, of, hybrid, warfare, is, to, exploit, vulnerabilities, and, weaknesses, in, order, to, achieve, geopolitical, and, strategic, goals, some, argue, that, china, s, greyzone, tactics, mainly, aim, to, improve, its, geopolitical, position, in, a, peaceful, manner, in, contrast, to, the, greyzone, tactics, used, by, russia, in, crimea, in, 2014, china, s, approach, differs, significantly, one, supporting, argument, is, that, the, majority, of, the, activities, occur, in, uninhabited, areas, at, sea, which, contradicts, a, definition, of, hybrid, warfare, that, suggests, it, is, targeted, at, populations, additionally, china, s, objective, is, not, to, destabilise, other, states, but, rather, to, enhance, its, national, security, by, gaining, control, over, regional, waters, furthermore, china, is, not, aiming, to, seize, control, from, another, power, but, rather, seeks, to, establish, a, dominant, security, and, political, position, in, the, region, it, is, worth, noting, that, china, employs, unarmed, or, lightly, armed, vessels, deliberately, as, they, are, unlikely, to, resort, to, deadly, force, however, others, argue, that, china, s, greyzone, tactics, can, be, classified, as, hybrid, warfare, some, viewpoints, contend, that, china, s, establishment, of, military, bases, on, artificial, islands, serves, as, a, means, to, assert, their, territorial, claims, through, the, use, of, force, this, approach, is, referred, to, as, the, cabbage, strategy, wherein, a, contested, area, is, encircled, by, multiple, layers, of, security, to, deny, access, to, rival, nations, ultimately, solidifying, their, claim, while, there, is, no, consensus, on, china, s, motives, behind, the, creation, of, artificial, islands, it, is, widely, acknowledged, that, china, aims, to, bolster, its, power, and, influence, in, the, region, these, actions, contribute, to, the, escalating, tensions, in, the, south, china, sea
