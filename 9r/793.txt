the, seabed, also, known, as, the, seafloor, sea, floor, ocean, floor, and, ocean, bottom, is, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, all, floors, of, the, ocean, are, known, as, seabeds, the, structure, of, the, seabed, of, the, global, ocean, is, governed, by, plate, tectonics, most, of, the, ocean, is, very, deep, where, the, seabed, is, known, as, the, abyssal, plain, seafloor, spreading, creates, mid, ocean, ridges, along, the, center, line, of, major, ocean, basins, where, the, seabed, is, slightly, shallower, than, the, surrounding, abyssal, plain, from, the, abyssal, plain, the, seabed, slopes, upward, toward, the, continents, and, becomes, in, order, from, deep, to, shallow, the, continental, rise, slope, and, shelf, the, depth, within, the, seabed, itself, such, as, the, depth, down, through, a, sediment, core, is, known, as, the, depth, below, seafloor, the, ecological, environment, of, the, seabed, and, the, deepest, waters, are, collectively, known, as, a, habitat, for, creatures, as, the, benthos, most, of, the, seabed, throughout, the, world, s, oceans, is, covered, in, layers, of, marine, sediments, categorized, by, where, the, materials, come, from, or, composition, these, sediments, are, classified, as, either, from, land, terrigenous, from, biological, organisms, biogenous, from, chemical, reactions, hydrogenous, and, from, space, cosmogenous, categorized, by, size, these, sediments, range, from, very, small, particles, called, clays, and, silts, known, as, mud, to, larger, particles, from, sand, to, boulders, features, of, the, seabed, are, governed, by, the, physics, of, sediment, transport, and, by, the, biology, of, the, creatures, living, in, the, seabed, and, in, the, ocean, waters, above, physically, seabed, sediments, often, come, from, the, erosion, of, material, on, land, and, from, other, rarer, sources, such, as, volcanic, ash, sea, currents, transport, sediments, especially, in, shallow, waters, where, tidal, energy, and, wave, energy, cause, resuspension, of, seabed, sediments, biologically, microorganisms, living, within, the, seabed, sediments, change, seabed, chemistry, marine, organisms, create, sediments, both, within, the, seabed, and, in, the, water, above, for, example, phytoplankton, with, silicate, or, calcium, carbonate, shells, grow, in, abundance, in, the, upper, ocean, and, when, they, die, their, shells, sink, to, the, seafloor, to, become, seabed, sediments, human, impacts, on, the, seabed, are, diverse, examples, of, human, effects, on, the, seabed, include, exploration, plastic, pollution, and, exploitation, by, mining, and, dredging, operations, to, map, the, seabed, ships, use, acoustic, technology, to, map, water, depths, throughout, the, world, submersible, vehicles, help, researchers, study, unique, seabed, ecosystems, such, as, hydrothermal, vents, plastic, pollution, is, a, global, phenomenon, and, because, the, ocean, is, the, ultimate, destination, for, global, waterways, much, of, the, world, s, plastic, ends, up, in, the, ocean, and, some, sinks, to, the, seabed, exploitation, of, the, seabed, involves, extracting, valuable, minerals, from, sulfide, deposits, via, deep, sea, mining, as, well, as, dredging, sand, from, shallow, environments, for, construction, and, beach, nourishment, most, of, the, oceans, have, a, common, structure, created, by, common, physical, phenomena, mainly, from, tectonic, movement, and, sediment, from, various, sources, the, structure, of, the, oceans, starting, with, the, continents, begins, usually, with, a, continental, shelf, continues, to, the, continental, slope, which, is, a, steep, descent, into, the, ocean, until, reaching, the, abyssal, plain, a, topographic, plain, the, beginning, of, the, seabed, and, its, main, area, the, border, between, the, continental, slope, and, the, abyssal, plain, usually, has, a, more, gradual, descent, and, is, called, the, continental, rise, which, is, caused, by, sediment, cascading, down, the, continental, slope, the, mid, ocean, ridge, as, its, name, implies, is, a, mountainous, rise, through, the, middle, of, all, the, oceans, between, the, continents, typically, a, rift, runs, along, the, edge, of, this, ridge, along, tectonic, plate, edges, there, are, typically, oceanic, trenches, deep, valleys, created, by, the, mantle, circulation, movement, from, the, mid, ocean, mountain, ridge, to, the, oceanic, trench, hotspot, volcanic, island, ridges, are, created, by, volcanic, activity, erupting, periodically, as, the, tectonic, plates, pass, over, a, hotspot, in, areas, with, volcanic, activity, and, in, the, oceanic, trenches, there, are, hydrothermal, vents, releasing, high, pressure, and, extremely, hot, water, and, chemicals, into, the, typically, freezing, water, around, it, deep, ocean, water, is, divided, into, layers, or, zones, each, with, typical, features, of, salinity, pressure, temperature, and, marine, life, according, to, their, depth, lying, along, the, top, of, the, abyssal, plain, is, the, abyssal, zone, whose, lower, boundary, lies, at, about, 6, 000, m, 20, 000, ft, the, hadal, zone, which, includes, the, oceanic, trenches, lies, between, 6, 000, and, 11, 000, metres, 20, 000, 36, 000, ft, and, is, the, deepest, oceanic, zone, depth, below, seafloor, is, a, vertical, coordinate, used, in, geology, paleontology, oceanography, and, petrology, see, ocean, drilling, the, acronym, mbsf, meaning, meters, below, the, seafloor, is, a, common, convention, used, for, depths, below, the, seafloor, sediments, in, the, seabed, vary, in, origin, from, eroded, land, materials, carried, into, the, ocean, by, rivers, or, wind, flow, waste, and, decompositions, of, sea, creatures, and, precipitation, of, chemicals, within, the, sea, water, itself, including, some, from, outer, space, there, are, four, basic, types, of, sediment, of, the, sea, floor, terrigenous, sediment, is, the, most, abundant, sediment, found, on, the, seafloor, terrigenous, sediments, come, from, the, continents, these, materials, are, eroded, from, continents, and, transported, by, wind, and, water, to, the, ocean, fluvial, sediments, are, transported, from, land, by, rivers, and, glaciers, such, as, clay, silt, mud, and, glacial, flour, aeolian, sediments, are, transported, by, wind, such, as, dust, and, volcanic, ash, biogenous, sediment, is, the, next, most, abundant, material, on, the, seafloor, biogenous, sediments, are, biologically, produced, by, living, creatures, sediments, made, up, of, at, least, 30, biogenous, material, are, called, oozes, there, are, two, types, of, oozes, calcareous, oozes, and, siliceous, oozes, plankton, grow, in, ocean, waters, and, create, the, materials, that, become, oozes, on, the, seabed, calcareous, oozes, are, predominantly, composed, of, calcium, shells, found, in, phytoplankton, such, as, coccolithophores, and, zooplankton, like, the, foraminiferans, these, calcareous, oozes, are, never, found, deeper, than, about, 4, 000, to, 5, 000, meters, because, at, further, depths, the, calcium, dissolves, similarly, siliceous, oozes, are, dominated, by, the, siliceous, shells, of, phytoplankton, like, diatoms, and, zooplankton, such, as, radiolarians, depending, on, the, productivity, of, these, planktonic, organisms, the, shell, material, that, collects, when, these, organisms, die, may, build, up, at, a, rate, anywhere, from, 1, mm, to, 1, cm, every, 1000, years, hydrogenous, sediments, are, uncommon, they, only, occur, with, changes, in, oceanic, conditions, such, as, temperature, and, pressure, rarer, still, are, cosmogenous, sediments, hydrogenous, sediments, are, formed, from, dissolved, chemicals, that, precipitate, from, the, ocean, water, or, along, the, mid, ocean, ridges, they, can, form, by, metallic, elements, binding, onto, rocks, that, have, water, of, more, than, 300, c, circulating, around, them, when, these, elements, mix, with, the, cold, sea, water, they, precipitate, from, the, cooling, water, known, as, manganese, nodules, they, are, composed, of, layers, of, different, metals, like, manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and, copper, and, they, are, always, found, on, the, surface, of, the, ocean, floor, cosmogenous, sediments, are, the, remains, of, space, debris, such, as, comets, and, asteroids, made, up, of, silicates, and, various, metals, that, have, impacted, the, earth, another, way, that, sediments, are, described, is, through, their, descriptive, classification, these, sediments, vary, in, size, anywhere, from, 1, 4096, of, a, mm, to, greater, than, 256, mm, the, different, types, are, boulder, cobble, pebble, granule, sand, silt, and, clay, each, type, becoming, finer, in, grain, the, grain, size, indicates, the, type, of, sediment, and, the, environment, in, which, it, was, created, larger, grains, sink, faster, and, can, only, be, pushed, by, rapid, flowing, water, high, energy, environment, whereas, small, grains, sink, very, slowly, and, can, be, suspended, by, slight, water, movement, accumulating, in, conditions, where, water, is, not, moving, so, quickly, this, means, that, larger, grains, of, sediment, may, come, together, in, higher, energy, conditions, and, smaller, grains, in, lower, energy, conditions, benthos, from, ancient, greek, b, nthos, the, depths, also, known, as, benthon, is, the, community, of, organisms, that, live, on, in, or, near, the, bottom, of, a, sea, river, lake, or, stream, also, known, as, the, benthic, zone, this, community, lives, in, or, near, marine, or, freshwater, sedimentary, environments, from, tidal, pools, along, the, foreshore, out, to, the, continental, shelf, and, then, down, to, the, abyssal, depths, many, organisms, adapted, to, deep, water, pressure, cannot, survive, in, the, upper, parts, of, the, water, column, the, pressure, difference, can, be, very, significant, approximately, one, atmosphere, for, every, 10, metres, of, water, depth, because, light, is, absorbed, before, it, can, reach, deep, ocean, water, the, energy, source, for, deep, benthic, ecosystems, is, often, organic, matter, from, higher, up, in, the, water, column, that, drifts, down, to, the, depths, this, dead, and, decaying, matter, sustains, the, benthic, food, chain, most, organisms, in, the, benthic, zone, are, scavengers, or, detritivores, seabed, topography, ocean, topography, or, marine, topography, refers, to, the, shape, of, the, land, topography, when, it, interfaces, with, the, ocean, these, shapes, are, obvious, along, coastlines, but, they, occur, also, in, significant, ways, underwater, the, effectiveness, of, marine, habitats, is, partially, defined, by, these, shapes, including, the, way, they, interact, with, and, shape, ocean, currents, and, the, way, sunlight, diminishes, when, these, landforms, occupy, increasing, depths, tidal, networks, depend, on, the, balance, between, sedimentary, processes, and, hydrodynamics, however, anthropogenic, influences, can, impact, the, natural, system, more, than, any, physical, driver, marine, topographies, include, coastal, and, oceanic, landforms, ranging, from, coastal, estuaries, and, shorelines, to, continental, shelves, and, coral, reefs, further, out, in, the, open, ocean, they, include, underwater, and, deep, sea, features, such, as, ocean, rises, and, seamounts, the, submerged, surface, has, mountainous, features, including, a, globe, spanning, mid, ocean, ridge, system, as, well, as, undersea, volcanoes, oceanic, trenches, submarine, canyons, oceanic, plateaus, and, abyssal, plains, the, mass, of, the, oceans, is, approximately, 1, 35, 10, 18, metric, tons, or, about, 1, 4400, of, the, total, mass, of, the, earth, the, oceans, cover, an, area, of, 3, 618, 10, 8, km, 2, with, a, mean, depth, of, 3, 682, m, resulting, in, an, estimated, volume, of, 1, 332, 10, 9, km, 3, each, region, of, the, seabed, has, typical, features, such, as, common, sediment, composition, typical, topography, salinity, of, water, layers, above, it, marine, life, magnetic, direction, of, rocks, and, sedimentation, some, features, of, the, seabed, include, flat, abyssal, plains, mid, ocean, ridges, deep, trenches, and, hydrothermal, vents, seabed, topography, is, flat, where, layers, of, sediments, cover, the, tectonic, features, for, example, the, abyssal, plain, regions, of, the, ocean, are, relatively, flat, and, covered, in, many, layers, of, sediments, sediments, in, these, flat, areas, come, from, various, sources, including, but, not, limited, to, land, erosion, sediments, from, rivers, chemically, precipitated, sediments, from, hydrothermal, vents, microorganism, activity, sea, currents, eroding, the, seabed, and, transporting, sediments, to, the, deeper, ocean, and, phytoplankton, shell, materials, where, the, seafloor, is, actively, spreading, and, sedimentation, is, relatively, light, such, as, in, the, northern, and, eastern, atlantic, ocean, the, original, tectonic, activity, can, be, clearly, seen, as, straight, line, cracks, or, vents, thousands, of, kilometers, long, these, underwater, mountain, ranges, are, known, as, mid, ocean, ridges, other, seabed, environments, include, hydrothermal, vents, cold, seeps, and, shallow, areas, marine, life, is, abundant, in, the, deep, sea, around, hydrothermal, vents, large, deep, sea, communities, of, marine, life, have, been, discovered, around, black, and, white, smokers, vents, emitting, chemicals, toxic, to, humans, and, most, vertebrates, this, marine, life, receives, its, energy, both, from, the, extreme, temperature, difference, typically, a, drop, of, 150, degrees, and, from, chemosynthesis, by, bacteria, brine, pools, are, another, seabed, feature, usually, connected, to, cold, seeps, in, shallow, areas, the, seabed, can, host, sediments, created, by, marine, life, such, as, corals, fish, algae, crabs, marine, plants, and, other, organisms, the, seabed, has, been, explored, by, submersibles, such, as, alvin, and, to, some, extent, scuba, divers, with, special, equipment, hydrothermal, vents, were, discovered, in, 1977, by, researchers, using, an, underwater, camera, platform, in, recent, years, satellite, measurements, of, ocean, surface, topography, show, very, clear, maps, of, the, seabed, and, these, satellite, derived, maps, are, used, extensively, in, the, study, and, exploration, of, the, ocean, floor, in, 2020, scientists, created, what, may, be, the, first, scientific, estimate, of, how, much, microplastic, currently, resides, in, earth, s, seafloor, after, investigating, six, areas, of, 3, km, depth, 300, km, off, the, australian, coast, they, found, the, highly, variable, microplastic, counts, to, be, proportionate, to, plastic, on, the, surface, and, the, angle, of, the, seafloor, slope, by, averaging, the, microplastic, mass, per, cm, 3, they, estimated, that, earth, s, seafloor, contains, 14, million, tons, of, microplastic, about, double, the, amount, they, estimated, based, on, data, from, earlier, studies, despite, calling, both, estimates, conservative, as, coastal, areas, are, known, to, contain, much, more, microplastic, pollution, these, estimates, are, about, one, to, two, times, the, amount, of, plastic, thought, per, jambeck, et, al, 2015, to, currently, enter, the, oceans, annually, deep, sea, mining, is, the, extraction, of, minerals, from, the, seabed, of, the, deep, sea, the, main, ores, of, commercial, interest, are, polymetallic, nodules, which, are, found, at, depths, of, 4, 6, km, 2, 5, 3, 7, mi, primarily, on, the, abyssal, plain, the, clarion, clipperton, zone, ccz, alone, contains, over, 21, billion, metric, tons, of, these, nodules, with, minerals, such, as, copper, nickel, and, cobalt, making, up, 2, 5, of, their, weight, it, is, estimated, that, the, global, ocean, floor, holds, more, than, 120, million, tons, of, cobalt, five, times, the, amount, found, in, terrestrial, reserves, as, of, july, 2024, only, exploratory, licenses, have, been, issued, with, no, commercial, scale, deep, sea, mining, operations, yet, the, international, seabed, authority, isa, regulates, all, mineral, related, activities, in, international, waters, and, has, granted, 31, exploration, licenses, so, far, 19, for, polymetallic, nodules, mostly, in, the, ccz, 7, for, polymetallic, sulphides, in, mid, ocean, ridges, and, 5, for, cobalt, rich, crusts, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, there, is, a, push, for, deep, sea, mining, to, commence, by, 2025, when, regulations, by, the, isa, are, expected, to, be, completed, deep, sea, mining, is, also, possible, in, the, exclusive, economic, zone, eez, of, countries, such, as, norway, where, it, has, been, approved, in, 2022, the, cook, islands, seabed, minerals, authority, sbma, granted, three, exploration, licenses, for, cobalt, rich, polymetallic, nodules, within, their, eez, papua, new, guinea, was, the, first, country, to, approve, a, deep, sea, mining, permit, for, the, solwara, 1, project, despite, three, independent, reviews, highlighting, significant, gaps, and, flaws, in, the, environmental, impact, statement, the, most, common, commercial, model, of, deep, sea, mining, proposed, involves, a, caterpillar, track, hydraulic, collector, and, a, riser, lift, system, bringing, the, harvested, ore, to, a, production, support, vessel, with, dynamic, positioning, and, then, depositing, extra, discharge, down, the, water, column, related, technologies, include, robotic, mining, machines, as, surface, ships, and, offshore, and, onshore, metal, refineries, wind, farms, solar, energy, electric, vehicles, and, battery, technologies, use, many, of, the, deep, sea, metals, electric, vehicle, batteries, are, the, main, driver, of, the, critical, metals, demand, that, incentivises, deep, sea, mining, the, environmental, impact, of, deep, sea, mining, is, controversial, environmental, advocacy, groups, such, as, greenpeace, and, the, deep, sea, mining, campaign, claimed, that, seabed, mining, has, the, potential, to, damage, deep, sea, ecosystems, and, spread, pollution, from, heavy, metal, laden, plumes, critics, have, called, for, moratoria, or, permanent, bans, opposition, campaigns, enlisted, the, support, of, some, industry, figures, including, firms, reliant, on, the, target, metals, individual, countries, with, significant, deposits, within, their, exclusive, economic, zones, eez, s, are, exploring, the, subject, some, children, s, play, songs, include, elements, such, as, there, s, a, hole, at, the, bottom, of, the, sea, or, a, sailor, went, to, sea, but, all, that, he, could, see, was, the, bottom, of, the, deep, blue, sea, on, and, under, the, seabed, are, archaeological, sites, of, historic, interest, such, as, shipwrecks, and, sunken, towns, this, underwater, cultural, heritage, is, protected, by, the, unesco, convention, on, the, protection, of, the, underwater, cultural, heritage, the, convention, aims, at, preventing, looting, and, the, destruction, or, loss, of, historic, and, cultural, information, by, providing, an, international, legal, framework
