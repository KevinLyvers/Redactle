the, metre, or, meter, in, us, spelling, symbol, m, is, the, base, unit, of, length, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, since, 2019, the, metre, has, been, defined, as, the, length, of, the, path, travelled, by, light, in, vacuum, during, a, time, interval, of, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, where, the, second, is, defined, by, a, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, caesium, the, metre, was, originally, defined, in, 1791, by, the, french, national, assembly, as, one, ten, millionth, of, the, distance, from, the, equator, to, the, north, pole, along, a, great, circle, so, the, earth, s, polar, circumference, is, approximately, 40, 000, km, in, 1799, the, metre, was, redefined, in, terms, of, a, prototype, metre, bar, the, bar, used, was, changed, in, 1889, and, in, 1960, the, metre, was, redefined, in, terms, of, a, certain, number, of, wavelengths, of, a, certain, emission, line, of, krypton, 86, the, current, definition, was, adopted, in, 1983, and, modified, slightly, in, 2002, to, clarify, that, the, metre, is, a, measure, of, proper, length, from, 1983, until, 2019, the, metre, was, formally, defined, as, the, length, of, the, path, travelled, by, light, in, vacuum, in, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, after, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, this, definition, was, rephrased, to, include, the, definition, of, a, second, in, terms, of, the, caesium, frequency, cs, this, series, of, amendments, did, not, alter, the, size, of, the, metre, significantly, today, earth, s, polar, circumference, measures, 40, 007, 863, km, a, change, of, 0, 022, from, the, original, value, of, exactly, 40, 000, km, which, also, includes, improvements, in, the, accuracy, of, measuring, the, circumference, metre, is, the, standard, spelling, of, the, metric, unit, for, length, in, nearly, all, english, speaking, nations, the, exceptions, being, the, united, states, and, the, philippines, which, use, meter, measuring, devices, such, as, ammeter, speedometer, are, spelled, meter, in, all, variants, of, english, the, suffix, meter, has, the, same, greek, origin, as, the, unit, of, length, the, etymological, roots, of, metre, can, be, traced, to, the, greek, verb, metreo, i, measure, count, or, compare, and, noun, metron, a, measure, which, were, used, for, physical, measurement, for, poetic, metre, and, by, extension, for, moderation, or, avoiding, extremism, as, in, be, measured, in, your, response, this, range, of, uses, is, also, found, in, latin, metior, mensura, french, m, tre, mesure, english, and, other, languages, the, greek, word, is, derived, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, meh, to, measure, the, motto, metro, chro, in, the, seal, of, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, which, was, a, saying, of, the, greek, statesman, and, philosopher, pittacus, of, mytilene, and, may, be, translated, as, use, measure, thus, calls, for, both, measurement, and, moderation, the, use, of, the, word, metre, for, the, french, unit, m, tre, in, english, began, at, least, as, early, as, 1797, galileo, discovered, gravitational, acceleration, to, explain, the, fall, of, bodies, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, he, also, observed, the, regularity, of, the, period, of, swing, of, the, pendulum, and, that, this, period, depended, on, the, length, of, the, pendulum, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, served, both, to, the, discovery, of, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, and, to, the, determination, of, the, distance, from, earth, to, the, sun, by, giovanni, domenico, cassini, they, both, also, used, a, determination, of, the, size, of, the, earth, then, considered, as, a, sphere, by, jean, picard, through, triangulation, of, paris, meridian, in, 1671, jean, picard, also, measured, the, length, of, a, seconds, pendulum, at, paris, observatory, and, proposed, this, unit, of, measurement, to, be, called, the, astronomical, radius, french, rayon, astronomique, in, 1675, tito, livio, burattini, suggested, the, term, metro, cattolico, meaning, universal, measure, for, this, unit, of, length, but, then, it, was, discovered, that, the, length, of, a, seconds, pendulum, varies, from, place, to, place, christiaan, huygens, found, out, the, centrifugal, force, which, explained, variations, of, gravitational, acceleration, depending, on, latitude, he, also, mathematically, formulated, the, link, between, the, length, of, the, simple, pendulum, and, gravitational, acceleration, according, to, alexis, clairaut, the, study, of, variations, in, gravitational, acceleration, was, a, way, to, determine, the, figure, of, the, earth, whose, crucial, parameter, was, the, flattening, of, the, earth, ellipsoid, in, the, 18th, century, in, addition, of, its, significance, for, cartography, geodesy, grew, in, importance, as, a, means, of, empirically, demonstrating, the, theory, of, gravity, which, milie, du, ch, telet, promoted, in, france, in, combination, with, leibniz, s, mathematical, work, and, because, the, radius, of, the, earth, was, the, unit, to, which, all, celestial, distances, were, to, be, referred, indeed, earth, proved, to, be, an, oblate, spheroid, through, geodetic, surveys, in, ecuador, and, lapland, and, this, new, data, called, into, question, the, value, of, earth, radius, as, picard, had, calculated, it, after, the, anglo, french, survey, the, french, academy, of, sciences, commissioned, an, expedition, led, by, jean, baptiste, joseph, delambre, and, pierre, m, chain, lasting, from, 1792, to, 1798, which, measured, the, distance, between, a, belfry, in, dunkirk, and, montju, c, castle, in, barcelona, at, the, longitude, of, the, paris, panth, on, when, the, length, of, the, metre, was, defined, as, one, ten, millionth, of, the, distance, from, the, north, pole, to, the, equator, the, flattening, of, the, earth, ellipsoid, was, assumed, to, be, 1, 334, in, 1841, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, using, the, method, of, least, squares, calculated, from, several, arc, measurements, a, new, value, for, the, flattening, of, the, earth, which, he, determinated, as, 1, 299, 15, he, also, devised, a, new, instrument, for, measuring, gravitational, acceleration, which, was, first, used, in, switzerland, by, emile, plantamour, charles, sanders, peirce, and, isaac, charles, lis, e, cell, rier, 8, 01, 1818, 2, 10, 1889, a, genevan, mathematician, soon, independently, discovered, a, mathematical, formula, to, correct, systematic, errors, of, this, device, which, had, been, noticed, by, plantamour, and, adolphe, hirsch, this, allowed, friedrich, robert, helmert, to, determine, a, remarkably, accurate, value, of, 1, 298, 3, for, the, flattening, of, the, earth, when, he, proposed, his, ellipsoid, of, reference, in, 1901, this, was, also, the, result, of, the, metre, convention, of, 1875, when, the, metre, was, adopted, as, an, international, scientific, unit, of, length, for, the, convenience, of, continental, european, geodesists, following, the, example, of, ferdinand, rudolph, hassler, in, 1790, one, year, before, it, was, ultimately, decided, that, the, metre, would, be, based, on, the, earth, quadrant, a, quarter, of, the, earth, s, circumference, through, its, poles, talleyrand, proposed, that, the, metre, be, the, length, of, the, seconds, pendulum, at, a, latitude, of, 45, this, option, with, one, third, of, this, length, defining, the, foot, was, also, considered, by, thomas, jefferson, and, others, for, redefining, the, yard, in, the, united, states, shortly, after, gaining, independence, from, the, british, crown, instead, of, the, seconds, pendulum, method, the, commission, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, whose, members, included, borda, lagrange, laplace, monge, and, condorcet, decided, that, the, new, measure, should, be, equal, to, one, ten, millionth, of, the, distance, from, the, north, pole, to, the, equator, determined, through, measurements, along, the, meridian, passing, through, paris, apart, from, the, obvious, consideration, of, safe, access, for, french, surveyors, the, paris, meridian, was, also, a, sound, choice, for, scientific, reasons, a, portion, of, the, quadrant, from, dunkirk, to, barcelona, about, 1000, km, or, one, tenth, of, the, total, could, be, surveyed, with, start, and, end, points, at, sea, level, and, that, portion, was, roughly, in, the, middle, of, the, quadrant, where, the, effects, of, the, earth, s, oblateness, were, expected, not, to, have, to, be, accounted, for, improvements, in, the, measuring, devices, designed, by, borda, and, used, for, this, survey, also, raised, hopes, for, a, more, accurate, determination, of, the, length, of, this, meridian, arc, the, task, of, surveying, the, paris, meridian, arc, took, more, than, six, years, 1792, 1798, the, technical, difficulties, were, not, the, only, problems, the, surveyors, had, to, face, in, the, convulsed, period, of, the, aftermath, of, the, french, revolution, m, chain, and, delambre, and, later, arago, were, imprisoned, several, times, during, their, surveys, and, m, chain, died, in, 1804, of, yellow, fever, which, he, contracted, while, trying, to, improve, his, original, results, in, northern, spain, in, the, meantime, the, commission, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, calculated, a, provisional, value, from, older, surveys, of, 443, 44, lignes, this, value, was, set, by, legislation, on, 7, april, 1795, in, 1799, a, commission, including, johan, georg, tralles, jean, henri, van, swinden, adrien, marie, legendre, and, jean, baptiste, delambre, calculated, the, distance, from, dunkirk, to, barcelona, using, the, data, of, the, triangulation, between, these, two, towns, and, determined, the, portion, of, the, distance, from, the, north, pole, to, the, equator, it, represented, pierre, m, chain, s, and, jean, baptiste, delambre, s, measurements, were, combined, with, the, results, of, the, spanish, french, geodetic, mission, and, a, value, of, 1, 334, was, found, for, the, earth, s, flattening, however, french, astronomers, knew, from, earlier, estimates, of, the, earth, s, flattening, that, different, meridian, arcs, could, have, different, lengths, and, that, their, curvature, could, be, irregular, the, distance, from, the, north, pole, to, the, equator, was, then, extrapolated, from, the, measurement, of, the, paris, meridian, arc, between, dunkirk, and, barcelona, and, was, determined, as, 5, 130, 740, toises, as, the, metre, had, to, be, equal, to, one, ten, millionth, of, this, distance, it, was, defined, as, 0, 513074, toise, or, 3, feet, and, 11, 296, lines, of, the, toise, of, peru, which, had, been, constructed, in, 1735, for, the, french, geodesic, mission, to, the, equator, when, the, final, result, was, known, a, bar, whose, length, was, closest, to, the, meridional, definition, of, the, metre, was, selected, and, placed, in, the, national, archives, on, 22, june, 1799, 4, messidor, an, vii, in, the, republican, calendar, as, a, permanent, record, of, the, result, in, 1816, ferdinand, rudolph, hassler, was, appointed, first, superintendent, of, the, survey, of, the, coast, trained, in, geodesy, in, switzerland, france, and, germany, hassler, had, brought, a, standard, metre, made, in, paris, to, the, united, states, in, 1805, he, designed, a, baseline, apparatus, which, instead, of, bringing, different, bars, in, actual, contact, during, measurements, used, only, one, bar, calibrated, on, the, metre, and, optical, contact, thus, the, metre, became, the, unit, of, length, for, geodesy, in, the, united, states, in, 1830, hassler, became, head, of, the, office, of, weights, and, measures, which, became, a, part, of, the, survey, of, the, coast, he, compared, various, units, of, length, used, in, the, united, states, at, that, time, and, measured, coefficients, of, expansion, to, assess, temperature, effects, on, the, measurements, in, 1832, carl, friedrich, gauss, studied, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, proposed, adding, the, second, to, the, basic, units, of, the, metre, and, the, kilogram, in, the, form, of, the, cgs, system, centimetre, gram, second, in, 1836, he, founded, the, magnetischer, verein, the, first, international, scientific, association, in, collaboration, with, alexander, von, humboldt, and, wilhelm, edouard, weber, the, coordination, of, the, observation, of, geophysical, phenomena, such, as, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, lightning, and, gravity, in, different, points, of, the, globe, stimulated, the, creation, of, the, first, international, scientific, associations, the, foundation, of, the, magnetischer, verein, would, be, followed, by, that, of, the, central, european, arc, measurement, german, mitteleuropa, sche, gradmessung, on, the, initiative, of, johann, jacob, baeyer, in, 1863, and, by, that, of, the, international, meteorological, organisation, whose, president, the, swiss, meteorologist, and, physicist, heinrich, von, wild, would, represent, russia, at, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, in, 1834, hassler, measured, at, fire, island, the, first, baseline, of, the, survey, of, the, coast, shortly, before, louis, puissant, declared, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1836, that, jean, baptiste, joseph, delambre, and, pierre, m, chain, had, made, errors, in, the, meridian, arc, measurement, which, had, been, used, to, determine, the, length, of, the, metre, errors, in, the, method, of, calculating, the, length, of, the, paris, meridian, were, taken, into, account, by, bessel, when, he, proposed, his, reference, ellipsoid, in, 1841, egyptian, astronomy, has, ancient, roots, which, were, revived, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, modernist, impetus, of, muhammad, ali, who, founded, in, sabtieh, boulaq, district, in, cairo, an, observatory, which, he, was, keen, to, keep, in, harmony, with, the, progress, of, this, science, still, in, progress, in, 1858, a, technical, commission, was, set, up, to, continue, by, adopting, the, procedures, instituted, in, europe, the, cadastre, work, inaugurated, under, muhammad, ali, this, commission, suggested, to, viceroy, mohammed, sa, id, pasha, the, idea, of, buying, geodetic, devices, which, were, ordered, in, france, while, mahmud, ahmad, hamdi, al, falaki, was, in, charge, in, egypt, of, the, direction, of, the, work, of, the, general, map, the, viceroy, entrusted, to, ismail, mustafa, al, falaki, the, study, in, europe, of, the, precision, apparatus, calibrated, against, the, metre, intended, to, measure, the, geodesic, bases, and, already, built, by, jean, brunner, in, paris, ismail, mustafa, had, the, task, to, carry, out, the, experiments, necessary, for, determining, the, expansion, coefficients, of, the, two, platinum, and, brass, bars, and, to, compare, the, egyptian, standard, with, a, known, standard, the, spanish, standard, designed, by, carlos, ib, ez, e, ib, ez, de, ibero, and, frutos, saavedra, meneses, was, chosen, for, this, purpose, as, it, had, served, as, a, model, for, the, construction, of, the, egyptian, standard, in, addition, the, spanish, standard, had, been, compared, with, borda, s, double, toise, n, 1, which, served, as, a, comparison, module, for, the, measurement, of, all, geodesic, bases, in, france, and, was, also, to, be, compared, to, the, ib, ez, apparatus, in, 1954, the, connection, of, the, southerly, extension, of, the, struve, geodetic, arc, with, an, arc, running, northwards, from, south, africa, through, egypt, would, bring, the, course, of, a, major, meridian, arc, back, to, land, where, eratosthenes, had, founded, geodesy, seventeen, years, after, bessel, calculated, his, ellipsoid, of, reference, some, of, the, meridian, arcs, the, german, astronomer, had, used, for, his, calculation, had, been, enlarged, this, was, a, very, important, circumstance, because, the, influence, of, errors, due, to, vertical, deflections, was, minimized, in, proportion, to, the, length, of, the, meridian, arcs, the, longer, the, meridian, arcs, the, more, precise, the, image, of, the, earth, ellipsoid, would, be, after, struve, geodetic, arc, measurement, it, was, resolved, in, the, 1860s, at, the, initiative, of, carlos, ib, ez, e, ib, ez, de, ibero, who, would, become, the, first, president, of, both, the, international, geodetic, association, and, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measure, to, remeasure, the, arc, of, meridian, from, dunkirk, to, formentera, and, to, extend, it, from, shetland, to, the, sahara, this, did, not, pave, the, way, to, a, new, definition, of, the, metre, because, it, was, known, that, the, theoretical, definition, of, the, metre, had, been, inaccessible, and, misleading, at, the, time, of, delambre, and, mechain, arc, measurement, as, the, geoid, is, a, ball, which, on, the, whole, can, be, assimilated, to, an, oblate, spheroid, but, which, in, detail, differs, from, it, so, as, to, prohibit, any, generalization, and, any, extrapolation, from, the, measurement, of, a, single, meridian, arc, in, 1859, friedrich, von, schubert, demonstrated, that, several, meridians, had, not, the, same, length, confirming, an, hypothesis, of, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, he, also, proposed, an, ellipsoid, with, three, unequal, axes, in, 1860, elie, ritter, a, mathematician, from, geneva, using, schubert, s, data, computed, that, the, earth, ellipsoid, could, rather, be, a, spheroid, of, revolution, accordingly, to, adrien, marie, legendre, s, model, however, the, following, year, resuming, his, calculation, on, the, basis, of, all, the, data, available, at, the, time, ritter, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, problem, was, only, resolved, in, an, approximate, manner, the, data, appearing, too, scant, and, for, some, affected, by, vertical, deflections, in, particular, the, latitude, of, montju, c, in, the, french, meridian, arc, which, determination, had, also, been, affected, in, a, lesser, proportion, by, systematic, errors, of, the, repeating, circle, the, definition, of, the, length, of, a, metre, in, the, 1790s, was, founded, upon, arc, measurements, in, france, and, peru, with, a, definition, that, it, was, to, be, 1, 40, millionth, of, the, circumference, of, the, earth, measured, through, the, poles, such, were, the, inaccuracies, of, that, period, that, within, a, matter, of, just, a, few, years, more, reliable, measurements, would, have, given, a, different, value, for, the, definition, of, this, international, standard, that, does, not, invalidate, the, metre, in, any, way, but, highlights, the, fact, that, continuing, improvements, in, instrumentation, made, better, measurements, of, the, earth, s, size, possible, it, was, well, known, that, by, measuring, the, latitude, of, two, stations, in, barcelona, m, chain, had, found, that, the, difference, between, these, latitudes, was, greater, than, predicted, by, direct, measurement, of, distance, by, triangulation, and, that, he, did, not, dare, to, admit, this, inaccuracy, this, was, later, explained, by, clearance, in, the, central, axis, of, the, repeating, circle, causing, wear, and, consequently, the, zenith, measurements, contained, significant, systematic, errors, polar, motion, predicted, by, leonhard, euler, and, later, discovered, by, seth, carlo, chandler, also, had, an, impact, on, accuracy, of, latitudes, determinations, among, all, these, sources, of, error, it, was, mainly, an, unfavourable, vertical, deflection, that, gave, an, inaccurate, determination, of, barcelona, s, latitude, and, a, metre, too, short, compared, to, a, more, general, definition, taken, from, the, average, of, a, large, number, of, arcs, as, early, as, 1861, johann, jacob, baeyer, sent, a, memorandum, to, the, king, of, prussia, recommending, international, collaboration, in, central, europe, with, the, aim, of, determining, the, shape, and, dimensions, of, the, earth, at, the, time, of, its, creation, the, association, had, sixteen, member, countries, austrian, empire, kingdom, of, belgium, denmark, seven, german, states, grand, duchy, of, baden, kingdom, of, bavaria, kingdom, of, hanover, mecklenburg, kingdom, of, prussia, kingdom, of, saxony, saxe, coburg, and, gotha, kingdom, of, italy, netherlands, russian, empire, for, poland, united, kingdoms, of, sweden, and, norway, as, well, as, switzerland, the, central, european, arc, measurement, created, a, central, office, located, at, the, prussian, geodetic, institute, whose, management, was, entrusted, to, johann, jacob, baeyer, baeyer, s, goal, was, a, new, determination, of, anomalies, in, the, shape, of, the, earth, using, precise, triangulations, combined, with, gravity, measurements, this, involved, determining, the, geoid, by, means, of, gravimetric, and, leveling, measurements, in, order, to, deduce, the, exact, knowledge, of, the, terrestrial, spheroid, while, taking, into, account, local, variations, to, resolve, this, problem, it, was, necessary, to, carefully, study, considerable, areas, of, land, in, all, directions, baeyer, developed, a, plan, to, coordinate, geodetic, surveys, in, the, space, between, the, parallels, of, palermo, and, freetown, christiana, denmark, and, the, meridians, of, bonn, and, trunz, german, name, for, milejewo, in, poland, this, territory, was, covered, by, a, triangle, network, and, included, more, than, thirty, observatories, or, stations, whose, position, was, determined, astronomically, bayer, proposed, to, remeasure, ten, arcs, of, meridians, and, a, larger, number, of, arcs, of, parallels, to, compare, the, curvature, of, the, meridian, arcs, on, the, two, slopes, of, the, alps, in, order, to, determine, the, influence, of, this, mountain, range, on, vertical, deflection, baeyer, also, planned, to, determine, the, curvature, of, the, seas, the, mediterranean, sea, and, adriatic, sea, in, the, south, the, north, sea, and, the, baltic, sea, in, the, north, in, his, mind, the, cooperation, of, all, the, states, of, central, europe, could, open, the, field, to, scientific, research, of, the, highest, interest, research, that, each, state, taken, in, isolation, was, not, able, to, undertake, spain, and, portugal, joined, the, european, arc, measurement, in, 1866, french, empire, hesitated, for, a, long, time, before, giving, in, to, the, demands, of, the, association, which, asked, the, french, geodesists, to, take, part, in, its, work, it, was, only, after, the, franco, prussian, war, that, charles, eug, ne, delaunay, represented, france, at, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1871, in, 1874, herv, faye, was, appointed, member, of, the, permanent, commission, which, was, presided, by, carlos, ib, ez, e, ib, ez, de, ibero, the, international, geodetic, association, gained, global, importance, with, the, accession, of, chile, mexico, and, japan, in, 1888, argentina, and, united, states, in, 1889, and, british, empire, in, 1898, the, convention, of, the, international, geodetic, association, expired, at, the, end, of, 1916, it, was, not, renewed, due, to, the, first, world, war, however, the, activities, of, the, international, latitude, service, were, continued, through, an, association, g, odesique, r, duite, entre, tats, neutre, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, h, g, van, de, sande, bakhuyzen, and, raoul, gautier, 1854, 1931, respectively, directors, of, leiden, observatory, and, geneva, observatory, after, the, french, revolution, napoleonic, wars, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, metre, in, latin, america, following, independence, of, brazil, and, hispanic, america, while, the, american, revolution, prompted, the, foundation, of, the, survey, of, the, coast, in, 1807, and, the, creation, of, the, office, of, standard, weights, and, measures, in, 1830, in, continental, europe, napoleonic, wars, fostered, german, nationalism, which, later, led, to, unification, of, germany, in, 1871, meanwhile, most, european, countries, had, adopted, the, metre, in, the, 1870s, german, empire, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, unification, of, the, metric, system, through, the, european, arc, measurement, but, its, overwhelming, influence, was, mitigated, by, that, of, neutral, states, while, the, german, astronomer, wilhelm, julius, foerster, director, of, the, berlin, observatory, and, director, of, the, german, weights, and, measures, service, boycotted, the, permanent, committee, of, the, international, metre, commission, along, with, the, russian, and, austrian, representatives, in, order, to, promote, the, foundation, of, a, permanent, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, the, german, born, swiss, astronomer, adolphe, hirsch, conformed, to, the, opinion, of, italy, and, spain, to, create, in, spite, of, french, reluctance, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, in, france, as, a, permanent, institution, at, the, disadventage, of, the, conservatoire, national, des, arts, et, m, tiers, at, that, time, units, of, measurement, were, defined, by, primary, standards, and, unique, artifacts, made, of, different, alloys, with, distinct, coefficients, of, expansion, were, the, legal, basis, of, units, of, length, a, wrought, iron, ruler, the, toise, of, peru, also, called, toise, de, l, acad, mie, was, the, french, primary, standard, of, the, toise, and, the, metre, was, officially, defined, by, an, artifact, made, of, platinum, kept, in, the, national, archives, besides, the, latter, another, platinum, and, twelve, iron, standards, of, the, metre, were, made, by, tienne, lenoir, in, 1799, one, of, them, became, known, as, the, committee, meter, in, the, united, states, and, served, as, standard, of, length, in, the, united, states, coast, survey, until, 1890, according, to, geodesists, these, standards, were, secondary, standards, deduced, from, the, toise, of, peru, in, europe, except, spain, surveyors, continued, to, use, measuring, instruments, calibrated, on, the, toise, of, peru, among, these, the, toise, of, bessel, and, the, apparatus, of, borda, were, respectively, the, main, references, for, geodesy, in, prussia, and, in, france, these, measuring, devices, consisted, of, bimetallic, rulers, in, platinum, and, brass, or, iron, and, zinc, fixed, together, at, one, extremity, to, assess, the, variations, in, length, produced, by, any, change, in, temperature, the, combination, of, two, bars, made, of, two, different, metals, allowed, to, take, thermal, expansion, into, account, without, measuring, the, temperature, a, french, scientific, instrument, maker, jean, nicolas, fortin, had, made, three, direct, copies, of, the, toise, of, peru, one, for, friedrich, georg, wilhelm, von, struve, a, second, for, heinrich, christian, schumacher, in, 1821, and, a, third, for, friedrich, bessel, in, 1823, in, 1831, henri, prudence, gambey, also, realized, a, copy, of, the, toise, of, peru, which, was, kept, at, altona, observatory, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, creation, of, the, international, geodetic, association, would, mark, the, adoption, of, new, scientific, methods, it, then, became, possible, to, accurately, measure, parallel, arcs, since, the, difference, in, longitude, between, their, ends, could, be, determined, thanks, to, the, invention, of, the, electrical, telegraph, furthermore, advances, in, metrology, combined, with, those, of, gravimetry, have, led, to, a, new, era, of, geodesy, if, precision, metrology, had, needed, the, help, of, geodesy, the, latter, could, not, continue, to, prosper, without, the, help, of, metrology, it, was, then, necessary, to, define, a, single, unit, to, express, all, the, measurements, of, terrestrial, arcs, and, all, determinations, of, the, gravitational, acceleration, by, means, of, pendulum, in, 1866, the, most, important, concern, was, that, the, toise, of, peru, the, standard, of, the, toise, constructed, in, 1735, for, the, french, geodesic, mission, to, the, equator, might, be, so, much, damaged, that, comparison, with, it, would, be, worthless, while, bessel, had, questioned, the, accuracy, of, copies, of, this, standard, belonging, to, altona, and, koenigsberg, observatories, which, he, had, compared, to, each, other, about, 1840, this, assertion, was, particularly, worrying, because, when, the, primary, imperial, yard, standard, had, partially, been, destroyed, in, 1834, a, new, standard, of, reference, was, constructed, using, copies, of, the, standard, yard, 1760, instead, of, the, pendulum, s, length, as, provided, for, in, the, weights, and, measures, act, of, 1824, because, the, pendulum, method, proved, unreliable, nevertheless, ferdinand, rudolph, hassler, s, use, of, the, metre, and, the, creation, of, the, office, of, standard, weights, and, measures, as, an, office, within, the, coast, survey, contributed, to, the, introduction, of, the, metric, act, of, 1866, allowing, the, use, of, the, metre, in, the, united, states, and, preceded, the, choice, of, the, metre, as, international, scientific, unit, of, length, and, the, proposal, by, the, european, arc, measurement, german, europ, ische, gradmessung, to, establish, a, european, international, bureau, for, weights, and, measures, in, 1867, at, the, second, general, conference, of, the, international, association, of, geodesy, held, in, berlin, the, question, of, an, international, standard, unit, of, length, was, discussed, in, order, to, combine, the, measurements, made, in, different, countries, to, determine, the, size, and, shape, of, the, earth, according, to, a, preliminary, proposal, made, in, neuch, tel, the, precedent, year, the, general, conference, recommended, the, adoption, of, the, metre, in, replacement, of, the, toise, of, bessel, the, creation, of, an, international, metre, commission, and, the, foundation, of, a, world, institute, for, the, comparison, of, geodetic, standards, the, first, step, towards, the, creation, of, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, hassler, s, metrological, and, geodetic, work, also, had, a, favourable, response, in, russia, in, 1869, the, saint, petersburg, academy, of, sciences, sent, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, a, report, drafted, by, otto, wilhelm, von, struve, heinrich, von, wild, and, moritz, von, jacobi, whose, theorem, has, long, supported, the, assumption, of, an, ellipsoid, with, three, unequal, axes, for, the, figure, of, the, earth, inviting, his, french, counterpart, to, undertake, joint, action, to, ensure, the, universal, use, of, the, metric, system, in, all, scientific, work, in, the, 1870s, and, in, light, of, modern, precision, a, series, of, international, conferences, was, held, to, devise, new, metric, standards, when, a, conflict, broke, out, regarding, the, presence, of, impurities, in, the, metre, alloy, of, 1874, a, member, of, the, preparatory, committee, since, 1870, and, spanish, representative, at, the, paris, conference, in, 1875, carlos, ib, ez, e, ib, ez, de, ibero, intervened, with, the, french, academy, of, sciences, to, rally, france, to, the, project, to, create, an, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, equipped, with, the, scientific, means, necessary, to, redefine, the, units, of, the, metric, system, according, to, the, progress, of, sciences, the, metre, convention, convention, du, m, tre, of, 1875, mandated, the, establishment, of, a, permanent, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, bureau, international, des, poids, et, mesures, to, be, located, in, s, vres, france, this, new, organisation, was, to, construct, and, preserve, a, prototype, metre, bar, distribute, national, metric, prototypes, and, maintain, comparisons, between, them, and, non, metric, measurement, standards, the, organisation, distributed, such, bars, in, 1889, at, the, first, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, establishing, the, international, prototype, metre, as, the, distance, between, two, lines, on, a, standard, bar, composed, of, an, alloy, of, 90, platinum, and, 10, iridium, measured, at, the, melting, point, of, ice, the, comparison, of, the, new, prototypes, of, the, metre, with, each, other, involved, the, development, of, special, measuring, equipment, and, the, definition, of, a, reproducible, temperature, scale, the, bipm, s, thermometry, work, led, to, the, discovery, of, special, alloys, of, iron, nickel, in, particular, invar, whose, practically, negligible, coefficient, of, expansion, made, it, possible, to, develop, simpler, baseline, measurement, methods, and, for, which, its, director, the, swiss, physicist, charles, edouard, guillaume, was, granted, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1920, guillaume, s, nobel, prize, marked, the, end, of, an, era, in, which, metrology, was, leaving, the, field, of, geodesy, to, become, a, technological, application, of, physics, in, 1921, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, another, swiss, scientist, albert, einstein, who, following, michelson, morley, experiment, had, questioned, the, luminiferous, aether, in, 1905, just, as, newton, had, questioned, descartes, vortex, theory, in, 1687, after, jean, richer, s, pendulum, experiment, in, cayenne, french, guiana, furthermore, special, relativity, changed, conceptions, of, time, and, mass, while, general, relativity, changed, that, of, space, according, to, newton, space, was, euclidean, infinite, and, without, boundaries, and, bodies, gravitated, around, each, other, without, changing, the, structure, of, space, einstein, s, theory, of, gravity, states, on, the, contrary, that, the, mass, of, a, body, has, an, effect, on, all, other, bodies, while, modifying, the, structure, of, space, a, massive, body, induces, a, curvature, of, the, space, around, it, in, which, the, path, of, light, is, inflected, as, was, demonstrated, by, the, displacement, of, the, position, of, a, star, observed, near, the, sun, during, an, eclipse, in, 1919, in, 1873, james, clerk, maxwell, suggested, that, light, emitted, by, an, element, be, used, as, the, standard, both, for, the, unit, of, length, and, for, the, second, these, two, quantities, could, then, be, used, to, define, the, unit, of, mass, about, the, unit, of, length, he, wrote, in, the, present, state, of, science, the, most, universal, standard, of, length, which, we, could, assume, would, be, the, wave, length, in, vacuum, of, a, particular, kind, of, light, emitted, by, some, widely, diffused, substance, such, as, sodium, which, has, well, defined, lines, in, its, spectrum, such, a, standard, would, be, independent, of, any, changes, in, the, dimensions, of, the, earth, and, should, be, adopted, by, those, who, expect, their, writings, to, be, more, permanent, than, that, body, charles, sanders, peirce, s, work, promoted, the, advent, of, american, science, at, the, forefront, of, global, metrology, alongside, his, intercomparisons, of, artifacts, of, the, metre, and, contributions, to, gravimetry, through, improvement, of, reversible, pendulum, peirce, was, the, first, to, tie, experimentally, the, metre, to, the, wave, length, of, a, spectral, line, according, to, him, the, standard, length, might, be, compared, with, that, of, a, wave, of, light, identified, by, a, line, in, the, solar, spectrum, albert, michelson, soon, took, up, the, idea, and, improved, it, in, 1893, the, standard, metre, was, first, measured, with, an, interferometer, by, albert, a, michelson, the, inventor, of, the, device, and, an, advocate, of, using, some, particular, wavelength, of, light, as, a, standard, of, length, by, 1925, interferometry, was, in, regular, use, at, the, bipm, however, the, international, prototype, metre, remained, the, standard, until, 1960, when, the, eleventh, cgpm, defined, the, metre, in, the, new, international, system, of, units, si, as, equal, to, 1, 650, 763, 73, wavelengths, of, the, orange, red, emission, line, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, of, the, krypton, 86, atom, in, vacuum, to, further, reduce, uncertainty, the, 17th, cgpm, in, 1983, replaced, the, definition, of, the, metre, with, its, current, definition, thus, fixing, the, length, of, the, metre, in, terms, of, the, second, and, the, speed, of, light, this, definition, fixed, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, at, exactly, 299, 792, 458, metres, per, second, 300, 000, km, s, or, 1, 079, billion, km, hour, an, intended, by, product, of, the, 17th, cgpm, s, definition, was, that, it, enabled, scientists, to, compare, lasers, accurately, using, frequency, resulting, in, wavelengths, with, one, fifth, the, uncertainty, involved, in, the, direct, comparison, of, wavelengths, because, interferometer, errors, were, eliminated, to, further, facilitate, reproducibility, from, lab, to, lab, the, 17th, cgpm, also, made, the, iodine, stabilised, helium, neon, laser, a, recommended, radiation, for, realising, the, metre, for, the, purpose, of, delineating, the, metre, the, bipm, currently, considers, the, hene, laser, wavelength, hene, to, be, 632, 991, 212, 58, nm, with, an, estimated, relative, standard, uncertainty, u, of, 2, 1, 10, 11, this, uncertainty, is, currently, one, limiting, factor, in, laboratory, realisations, of, the, metre, and, it, is, several, orders, of, magnitude, poorer, than, that, of, the, second, based, upon, the, caesium, fountain, atomic, clock, u, 5, 10, 16, consequently, a, realisation, of, the, metre, is, usually, delineated, not, defined, today, in, labs, as, 1, 579, 800, 762, 042, 33, wavelengths, of, helium, neon, laser, light, in, vacuum, the, error, stated, being, only, that, of, frequency, determination, this, bracket, notation, expressing, the, error, is, explained, in, the, article, on, measurement, uncertainty, practical, realisation, of, the, metre, is, subject, to, uncertainties, in, characterising, the, medium, to, various, uncertainties, of, interferometry, and, to, uncertainties, in, measuring, the, frequency, of, the, source, a, commonly, used, medium, is, air, and, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, has, set, up, an, online, calculator, to, convert, wavelengths, in, vacuum, to, wavelengths, in, air, as, described, by, nist, in, air, the, uncertainties, in, characterising, the, medium, are, dominated, by, errors, in, measuring, temperature, and, pressure, errors, in, the, theoretical, formulas, used, are, secondary, by, implementing, a, refractive, index, correction, such, as, this, an, approximate, realisation, of, the, metre, can, be, implemented, in, air, for, example, using, the, formulation, of, the, metre, as, 1, 579, 800, 762, 042, 33, wavelengths, of, helium, neon, laser, light, in, vacuum, and, converting, the, wavelengths, in, vacuum, to, wavelengths, in, air, air, is, only, one, possible, medium, to, use, in, a, realisation, of, the, metre, and, any, partial, vacuum, can, be, used, or, some, inert, atmosphere, like, helium, gas, provided, the, appropriate, corrections, for, refractive, index, are, implemented, the, metre, is, defined, as, the, path, length, travelled, by, light, in, a, given, time, and, practical, laboratory, length, measurements, in, metres, are, determined, by, counting, the, number, of, wavelengths, of, laser, light, of, one, of, the, standard, types, that, fit, into, the, length, and, converting, the, selected, unit, of, wavelength, to, metres, three, major, factors, limit, the, accuracy, attainable, with, laser, interferometers, for, a, length, measurement, of, these, the, last, is, peculiar, to, the, interferometer, itself, the, conversion, of, a, length, in, wavelengths, to, a, length, in, metres, is, based, upon, the, relation, which, converts, the, unit, of, wavelength, to, metres, using, c, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, in, m, s, here, n, is, the, refractive, index, of, the, medium, in, which, the, measurement, is, made, and, f, is, the, measured, frequency, of, the, source, although, conversion, from, wavelengths, to, metres, introduces, an, additional, error, in, the, overall, length, due, to, measurement, error, in, determining, the, refractive, index, and, the, frequency, the, measurement, of, frequency, is, one, of, the, most, accurate, measurements, available, the, cipm, issued, a, clarification, in, 2002, its, definition, therefore, applies, only, within, a, spatial, extent, sufficiently, small, that, the, effects, of, the, non, uniformity, of, the, gravitational, field, can, be, ignored, note, that, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, this, effect, in, the, vertical, direction, is, about, 1, part, in, 10, 16, per, metre, in, this, case, the, effects, to, be, taken, into, account, are, those, of, special, relativity, only, in, france, the, metre, was, adopted, as, an, exclusive, measure, in, 1801, under, the, consulate, this, continued, under, the, first, french, empire, until, 1812, when, napoleon, decreed, the, introduction, of, the, non, decimal, mesures, usuelles, which, remained, in, use, in, france, up, to, 1840, in, the, reign, of, louis, philippe, meanwhile, the, metre, was, adopted, by, the, republic, of, geneva, after, the, joining, of, the, canton, of, geneva, to, switzerland, in, 1815, guillaume, henri, dufour, published, the, first, official, swiss, map, for, which, the, metre, was, adopted, as, the, unit, of, length, si, prefixes, can, be, used, to, denote, decimal, multiples, and, submultiples, of, the, metre, as, shown, in, the, table, below, long, distances, are, usually, expressed, in, km, astronomical, units, 149, 6, gm, light, years, 10, pm, or, parsecs, 31, pm, rather, than, in, mm, or, larger, multiples, 30, cm, 30, m, and, 300, m, are, more, common, than, 3, dm, 3, dam, and, 3, hm, respectively, the, terms, micron, and, millimicron, have, been, used, instead, of, micrometre, m, and, nanometre, nm, respectively, but, this, practice, is, discouraged, within, this, table, inch, and, yard, mean, international, inch, and, international, yard, respectively, though, approximate, conversions, in, the, left, column, hold, for, both, international, and, survey, units, one, metre, is, exactly, equivalent, to, 5, 000, 127, inches, and, to, 1, 250, 1, 143, yards, a, simple, mnemonic, to, assist, with, conversion, is, three, 3s, 1, metre, is, nearly, equivalent, to, 3, feet, 3, 3, 8, inches, this, gives, an, overestimate, of, 0, 125, mm, the, ancient, egyptian, cubit, was, about, 0, 5, m, surviving, rods, are, 523, 529, mm, scottish, and, english, definitions, of, the, ell, 2, cubits, were, 941, mm, 0, 941, m, and, 1143, mm, 1, 143, m, respectively, the, ancient, parisian, toise, fathom, was, slightly, shorter, than, 2, m, and, was, standardised, at, exactly, 2, m, in, the, mesures, usuelles, system, such, that, 1, m, was, exactly, 1, 2, toise, the, russian, verst, was, 1, 0668, km, the, swedish, mil, was, 10, 688, km, but, was, changed, to, 10, km, when, sweden, converted, to, metric, units
