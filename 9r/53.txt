a, degree, in, full, a, degree, of, arc, arc, degree, or, arcdegree, usually, denoted, by, the, degree, symbol, is, a, measurement, of, a, plane, angle, in, which, one, full, rotation, is, 360, degrees, it, is, not, an, si, unit, the, si, unit, of, angular, measure, is, the, radian, but, it, is, mentioned, in, the, si, brochure, as, an, accepted, unit, because, a, full, rotation, equals, 2, radians, one, degree, is, equivalent, to, 180, radians, the, original, motivation, for, choosing, the, degree, as, a, unit, of, rotations, and, angles, is, unknown, one, theory, states, that, it, is, related, to, the, fact, that, 360, is, approximately, the, number, of, days, in, a, year, ancient, astronomers, noticed, that, the, sun, which, follows, through, the, ecliptic, path, over, the, course, of, the, year, seems, to, advance, in, its, path, by, approximately, one, degree, each, day, some, ancient, calendars, such, as, the, persian, calendar, and, the, babylonian, calendar, used, 360, days, for, a, year, the, use, of, a, calendar, with, 360, days, may, be, related, to, the, use, of, sexagesimal, numbers, another, theory, is, that, the, babylonians, subdivided, the, circle, using, the, angle, of, an, equilateral, triangle, as, the, basic, unit, and, further, subdivided, the, latter, into, 60, parts, following, their, sexagesimal, numeric, system, the, earliest, trigonometry, used, by, the, babylonian, astronomers, and, their, greek, successors, was, based, on, chords, of, a, circle, a, chord, of, length, equal, to, the, radius, made, a, natural, base, quantity, one, sixtieth, of, this, using, their, standard, sexagesimal, divisions, was, a, degree, aristarchus, of, samos, and, hipparchus, seem, to, have, been, among, the, first, greek, scientists, to, exploit, babylonian, astronomical, knowledge, and, techniques, systematically, timocharis, aristarchus, aristillus, archimedes, and, hipparchus, were, the, first, greeks, known, to, divide, the, circle, in, 360, degrees, of, 60, arc, minutes, eratosthenes, used, a, simpler, sexagesimal, system, dividing, a, circle, into, 60, parts, another, motivation, for, choosing, the, number, 360, may, have, been, that, it, is, readily, divisible, 360, has, 24, divisors, making, it, one, of, only, 7, numbers, such, that, no, number, less, than, twice, as, much, has, more, divisors, sequence, a072938, in, the, oeis, furthermore, it, is, divisible, by, every, number, from, 1, to, 10, except, 7, this, property, has, many, useful, applications, such, as, dividing, the, world, into, 24, time, zones, each, of, which, is, nominally, 15, of, longitude, to, correlate, with, the, established, 24, hour, day, convention, finally, it, may, be, the, case, that, more, than, one, of, these, factors, has, come, into, play, according, to, that, theory, the, number, is, approximately, 365, because, of, the, apparent, movement, of, the, sun, against, the, celestial, sphere, and, that, it, was, rounded, to, 360, for, some, of, the, mathematical, reasons, cited, above, for, many, practical, purposes, a, degree, is, a, small, enough, angle, that, whole, degrees, provide, sufficient, precision, when, this, is, not, the, case, as, in, astronomy, or, for, geographic, coordinates, latitude, and, longitude, degree, measurements, may, be, written, using, decimal, degrees, dd, notation, for, example, 40, 1875, alternatively, the, traditional, sexagesimal, unit, subdivisions, can, be, used, one, degree, is, divided, into, 60, minutes, of, arc, and, one, minute, into, 60, seconds, of, arc, use, of, degrees, minutes, seconds, is, also, called, dms, notation, these, subdivisions, also, called, the, arcminute, and, arcsecond, are, represented, by, a, single, prime, and, double, prime, respectively, for, example, 40, 1875, 40, 11, 15, additional, precision, can, be, provided, using, decimal, fractions, of, an, arcsecond, maritime, charts, are, marked, in, degrees, and, decimal, minutes, to, facilitate, measurement, 1, minute, of, latitude, is, 1, nautical, mile, the, example, above, would, be, given, as, 40, 11, 25, commonly, written, as, 11, 25, or, 11, 25, the, older, system, of, thirds, fourths, etc, which, continues, the, sexagesimal, unit, subdivision, was, used, by, al, kashi, and, other, ancient, astronomers, but, is, rarely, used, today, these, subdivisions, were, denoted, by, writing, the, roman, numeral, for, the, number, of, sixtieths, in, superscript, 1, i, for, a, prime, minute, of, arc, 1, ii, for, a, second, 1, iii, for, a, third, 1, iv, for, a, fourth, etc, hence, the, modern, symbols, for, the, minute, and, second, of, arc, and, the, word, second, also, refer, to, this, system, si, prefixes, can, also, be, applied, as, in, e, g, millidegree, microdegree, etc, in, most, mathematical, work, beyond, practical, geometry, angles, are, typically, measured, in, radians, rather, than, degrees, this, is, for, a, variety, of, reasons, for, example, the, trigonometric, functions, have, simpler, and, more, natural, properties, when, their, arguments, are, expressed, in, radians, these, considerations, outweigh, the, convenient, divisibility, of, the, number, 360, one, complete, turn, 360, is, equal, to, 2, radians, so, 180, is, equal, to, radians, or, equivalently, the, degree, is, a, mathematical, constant, 1, 180, one, turn, corresponding, to, a, cycle, or, revolution, is, equal, to, 360, with, the, invention, of, the, metric, system, based, on, powers, of, ten, there, was, an, attempt, to, replace, degrees, by, decimal, degrees, in, france, and, nearby, countries, where, the, number, in, a, right, angle, is, equal, to, 100, gon, with, 400, gon, in, a, full, circle, 1, 10, 9, gon, this, was, called, grade, nouveau, or, grad, due, to, confusion, with, the, existing, term, grad, e, in, some, northern, european, countries, meaning, a, standard, degree, 1, 360, of, a, turn, the, new, unit, was, called, neugrad, in, german, whereas, the, old, degree, was, referred, to, as, altgrad, likewise, nygrad, in, danish, swedish, and, norwegian, also, gradian, and, n, gr, a, in, icelandic, to, end, the, confusion, the, name, gon, was, later, adopted, for, the, new, unit, although, this, idea, of, metrification, was, abandoned, by, napoleon, grades, continued, to, be, used, in, several, fields, and, many, scientific, calculators, support, them, decigrades, 1, 4, 000, were, used, with, french, artillery, sights, in, world, war, i, an, angular, mil, which, is, most, used, in, military, applications, has, at, least, three, specific, variants, ranging, from, 1, 6, 400, to, 1, 6, 000, it, is, approximately, equal, to, one, milliradian, c, 1, 6, 283, a, mil, measuring, 1, 6, 000, of, a, revolution, originated, in, the, imperial, russian, army, where, an, equilateral, chord, was, divided, into, tenths, to, give, a, circle, of, 600, units, this, may, be, seen, on, a, lining, plane, an, early, device, for, aiming, indirect, fire, artillery, dating, from, about, 1900, in, the, st, petersburg, museum, of, artillery
