marble, is, a, metamorphic, rock, consisting, of, carbonate, minerals, most, commonly, calcite, caco, 3, or, dolomite, camg, co, 3, 2, that, have, recrystallized, under, the, influence, of, heat, and, pressure, it, has, a, crystalline, texture, and, is, typically, not, foliated, layered, although, there, are, exceptions, in, geology, the, term, marble, refers, to, metamorphosed, limestone, but, its, use, in, stonemasonry, more, broadly, encompasses, unmetamorphosed, limestone, marble, is, commonly, used, for, sculpture, and, as, a, building, material, the, word, marble, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, m, rmaron, from, m, rmaros, crystalline, rock, shining, stone, perhaps, from, the, verb, marma, r, to, flash, sparkle, gleam, r, s, p, beekes, has, suggested, that, a, pre, greek, origin, is, probable, this, stem, is, also, the, ancestor, of, the, english, word, marmoreal, meaning, marble, like, while, the, english, term, marble, resembles, the, french, marbre, most, other, european, languages, with, words, like, marmoreal, more, closely, resemble, the, original, ancient, greek, marble, is, a, rock, resulting, from, metamorphism, of, sedimentary, carbonate, rocks, most, commonly, limestone, or, dolomite, metamorphism, causes, variable, re, crystallization, of, the, original, carbonate, mineral, grains, the, resulting, marble, rock, is, typically, composed, of, an, interlocking, mosaic, of, carbonate, crystals, primary, sedimentary, textures, and, structures, of, the, original, carbonate, rock, protolith, have, typically, been, modified, or, destroyed, pure, white, marble, is, the, result, of, metamorphism, of, a, very, pure, silicate, poor, limestone, or, dolomite, protolith, the, characteristic, swirls, and, veins, of, many, colored, marble, varieties, sometimes, called, striations, are, usually, due, to, various, mineral, impurities, such, as, clay, silt, sand, iron, oxides, or, chert, which, were, originally, present, as, grains, or, layers, in, the, limestone, green, coloration, is, often, due, to, serpentine, resulting, from, originally, magnesium, rich, limestone, or, dolomite, with, silica, impurities, these, various, impurities, have, been, mobilized, and, recrystallized, by, the, intense, pressure, and, heat, of, the, metamorphism, acids, react, with, the, calcium, carbonate, in, marble, producing, carbonic, acid, which, decomposes, quickly, to, co, 2, and, h, 2, o, and, other, soluble, salts, outdoor, marble, statues, gravestones, or, other, marble, structures, are, damaged, by, acid, rain, whether, by, carbonation, sulfation, or, the, formation, of, black, crust, accumulation, of, calcium, sulphate, nitrates, and, carbon, particles, vinegar, and, other, acidic, solutions, should, be, avoided, in, the, cleaning, of, marble, products, crystallization, refers, to, a, method, of, imparting, a, glossy, more, durable, finish, on, to, a, marble, floor, caco, 3, it, involves, polishing, the, surface, with, an, acidic, solution, and, a, steel, wool, pad, on, a, flooring, machine, the, chemical, reaction, below, shows, a, typical, process, using, magnesium, fluorosilicate, mgsif, 6, and, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, taking, place, the, resulting, calcium, hexafluorosilicate, casif, 6, is, bonded, to, the, surface, of, the, marble, this, is, harder, more, glossy, and, stain, resistant, compared, to, the, original, surface, the, other, often, used, method, of, finishing, marble, is, to, polish, with, oxalic, acid, h, 2, c, 2, o, 4, an, organic, acid, the, resulting, reaction, is, as, follows, in, this, case, the, calcium, oxalate, cac, 2, o, 4, formed, in, the, reaction, is, washed, away, with, the, slurry, leaving, a, surface, that, has, not, been, chemically, changed, the, haloalkaliphilic, methylotrophic, bacterium, methylophaga, murata, was, isolated, from, deteriorating, marble, in, the, kremlin, bacterial, and, fungal, degradation, was, detected, in, four, samples, of, marble, from, milan, cathedral, black, cladosporium, attacked, dried, acrylic, resin, using, melanin, marble, is, a, rock, composed, of, calcium, and, magnesium, carbonate, mostly, white, and, pink, common, marble, varieties, are, granular, limestone, or, dolomite, the, hardness, of, marble, is, very, high, because, the, internal, structure, of, the, rock, is, very, uniform, after, long, term, natural, aging, and, the, internal, stress, disappears, so, the, marble, will, not, be, deformed, due, to, temperature, and, has, strong, wear, resistance, it, is, a, very, popular, building, material, the, following, table, is, a, summary, of, the, features, of, marble, white, marble, has, been, prized, for, its, use, in, sculptures, since, classical, times, this, preference, has, to, do, with, its, softness, which, made, it, easier, to, carve, relative, isotropy, and, homogeneity, and, a, relative, resistance, to, shattering, also, the, low, index, of, refraction, of, calcite, allows, light, to, penetrate, 12, 7, to, 38, millimeters, into, the, stone, before, being, scattered, out, resulting, in, the, characteristic, waxy, look, which, brings, a, lifelike, luster, to, marble, sculptures, of, any, kind, which, is, why, many, sculptors, preferred, and, still, prefer, marble, for, sculpting, the, human, form, construction, marble, is, a, stone, which, is, composed, of, calcite, dolomite, or, serpentine, that, is, capable, of, taking, a, polish, more, generally, in, construction, specifically, the, dimension, stone, trade, the, term, marble, is, used, for, any, crystalline, calcitic, rock, and, some, non, calcitic, rocks, useful, as, building, stone, for, example, tennessee, marble, is, really, a, dense, granular, fossiliferous, gray, to, pink, to, maroon, ordovician, limestone, that, geologists, call, the, holston, formation, ashgabat, the, capital, city, of, turkmenistan, was, recorded, in, the, 2013, guinness, book, of, records, as, having, the, world, s, highest, concentration, of, white, marble, buildings, the, extraction, of, marble, is, performed, by, quarrying, blocks, are, favoured, for, most, purposes, and, can, be, created, through, various, techniques, including, drilling, and, blasting, water, jet, and, wedge, methods, limestones, are, often, commercially, and, historically, referred, to, as, marble, which, differs, from, the, geological, definition, in, 1998, marble, production, was, dominated, by, 4, countries, that, accounted, for, almost, half, of, world, production, of, marble, and, decorative, stone, italy, and, china, were, the, world, leaders, each, representing, 16, of, world, production, while, spain, and, india, produced, 9, and, 8, respectively, in, 2018, turkey, was, the, world, leader, in, marble, export, with, 42, share, in, global, marble, trade, followed, by, italy, with, 18, and, greece, with, 10, the, largest, importer, of, marble, in, 2018, was, china, with, a, 64, market, share, followed, by, india, with, 11, and, italy, with, 5, white, marbles, throughout, the, mediterranean, basin, were, widely, utilized, during, the, roman, period, extraction, centers, were, unevenly, distributed, across, the, italian, peninsula, mainland, greece, the, aegean, islands, asia, minor, and, smaller, hubs, like, those, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, need, for, extensive, trade, arose, due, to, this, imbalance, leading, to, the, widespread, exchange, of, marble, objects, including, building, elements, sculptures, and, sarcophagi, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, the, distribution, of, white, marble, from, the, late, 1st, century, bc, to, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, ad, a, gradual, decline, in, distribution, started, in, the, third, century, ad, according, to, the, united, states, geological, survey, u, s, domestic, marble, production, in, 2006, was, 46, 400, tons, valued, at, about, 18, 1, million, compared, to, 72, 300, tons, valued, at, 18, 9, million, in, 2005, crushed, marble, production, for, aggregate, and, industrial, uses, in, 2006, was, 11, 8, million, tons, valued, at, 116, million, of, which, 6, 5, million, tons, was, finely, ground, calcium, carbonate, and, the, rest, was, construction, aggregate, for, comparison, 2005, crushed, marble, production, was, 7, 76, million, tons, valued, at, 58, 7, million, of, which, 4, 8, million, tons, was, finely, ground, calcium, carbonate, and, the, rest, was, construction, aggregate, u, s, dimension, marble, demand, is, about, 1, 3, million, tons, the, dsan, world, demand, for, finished, marble, index, has, shown, a, growth, of, 12, annually, for, the, 2000, 2006, period, compared, to, 10, 5, annually, for, the, 2000, 2005, period, the, largest, dimension, marble, application, is, tile, the, stone, and, marble, industry, is, one, of, the, largest, industries, in, palestine, contributing, 20, 25, of, its, total, industrial, revenues, generating, usd, 400, 450, million, in, revenue, annually, the, industry, employs, 15, 000, 20, 000, workers, across, the, west, bank, across, 1200, 1700, facilities, and, amounts, to, 4, 5, of, the, nation, s, gdp, the, vast, majority, of, the, industry, s, exports, are, to, israel, marble, in, the, geologic, sense, does, not, naturally, outcrop, in, palestine, and, that, the, vast, majority, of, commercially, labeled, marble, produced, in, palestine, produced, would, be, geologically, considered, limestone, particulate, air, pollution, exposure, has, been, found, to, be, elevated, in, the, marble, production, industry, exposure, to, the, dust, produced, by, cutting, marble, could, impair, lung, function, or, cause, lung, disease, in, workers, such, as, silicosis, skin, and, eye, problems, are, also, a, potential, hazard, mitigations, such, as, dust, filters, or, dust, suppression, are, suggested, but, more, research, needs, to, be, carried, out, on, the, efficacy, of, safety, measures, in, the, united, states, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, marble, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 15, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 10, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, dust, debris, and, temperature, fluctuations, from, working, marble, can, endanger, the, eye, health, of, employees, for, the, staff, involved, in, marble, processing, it, is, necessary, to, provide, eye, protection, equipment, and, it, is, recommended, to, improve, the, education, of, all, workers, on, occupational, health, risks, and, strengthen, preventive, measures, as, the, favorite, medium, for, greek, and, roman, sculptors, and, architects, see, classical, sculpture, marble, has, become, a, cultural, symbol, of, tradition, and, refined, taste, its, extremely, varied, and, colorful, patterns, make, it, a, favorite, decorative, material, places, named, after, the, stone, include, marblehead, massachusetts, marblehead, ohio, marble, arch, london, the, sea, of, marmara, india, s, marble, rocks, and, the, towns, of, marble, minnesota, marble, colorado, marble, falls, texas, and, marble, hill, manhattan, new, york, the, elgin, marbles, are, marble, sculptures, from, the, parthenon, in, athens, that, are, on, display, in, the, british, museum, total, world, quarrying, production, in, 2019, was, approximately, 316, million, tonnes, however, quarrying, waste, accounted, for, 53, of, this, total, production, in, the, process, of, marble, mining, and, processing, there, will, be, a, large, amount, of, non, degradable, waste, which, will, cause, serious, damage, to, the, environment, and, threaten, the, life, of, animals, and, plants, for, example, the, poor, management, of, mining, activities, has, resulted, in, a, large, amount, of, waste, rocks, and, the, waste, is, thrown, by, the, river, polluting, the, surrounding, water, sources, causing, groundwater, pollution, and, endangering, human, health, according, to, the, research, of, water, samples, around, the, marble, mine, it, was, found, that, the, number, of, cations, and, anions, in, the, water, increased, marble, sludge, waste, can, be, used, as, a, mineral, filler, in, water, based, paints, using, ground, calcium, carbonate, as, a, filler, in, paint, production, can, improve, the, brightness, hiding, power, and, application, performance, of, paint, and, can, also, replace, expensive, pigments, such, as, titanium, dioxide, recycling, of, marble, waste, leads, to, a, large, amount, of, waste, not, being, land, filled, reducing, environmental, pollution, thereby, realizing, the, sustainability, of, marble, converting, waste, to, generate, economic, income, and, restore, degraded, soil, can, improve, the, environment, the, nature, of, marble, is, soft, and, porous, so, it, is, easily, stained, by, colored, liquids, and, scratches, easily, maintenance, and, cleaning, is, particularly, important
