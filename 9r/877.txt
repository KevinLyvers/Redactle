crystallization, is, the, process, by, which, solids, form, where, the, atoms, or, molecules, are, highly, organized, into, a, structure, known, as, a, crystal, some, ways, by, which, crystals, form, are, precipitating, from, a, solution, freezing, or, more, rarely, deposition, directly, from, a, gas, attributes, of, the, resulting, crystal, depend, largely, on, factors, such, as, temperature, air, pressure, cooling, rate, and, in, the, case, of, liquid, crystals, time, of, fluid, evaporation, crystallization, occurs, in, two, major, steps, the, first, is, nucleation, the, appearance, of, a, crystalline, phase, from, either, a, supercooled, liquid, or, a, supersaturated, solvent, the, second, step, is, known, as, crystal, growth, which, is, the, increase, in, the, size, of, particles, and, leads, to, a, crystal, state, an, important, feature, of, this, step, is, that, loose, particles, form, layers, at, the, crystal, s, surface, and, lodge, themselves, into, open, inconsistencies, such, as, pores, cracks, etc, the, majority, of, minerals, and, organic, molecules, crystallize, easily, and, the, resulting, crystals, are, generally, of, good, quality, i, e, without, visible, defects, however, larger, biochemical, particles, like, proteins, are, often, difficult, to, crystallize, the, ease, with, which, molecules, will, crystallize, strongly, depends, on, the, intensity, of, either, atomic, forces, in, the, case, of, mineral, substances, intermolecular, forces, organic, and, biochemical, substances, or, intramolecular, forces, biochemical, substances, crystallization, is, also, a, chemical, solid, liquid, separation, technique, in, which, mass, transfer, of, a, solute, from, the, liquid, solution, to, a, pure, solid, crystalline, phase, occurs, in, chemical, engineering, crystallization, occurs, in, a, crystallizer, crystallization, is, therefore, related, to, precipitation, although, the, result, is, not, amorphous, or, disordered, but, a, crystal, the, crystallization, process, consists, of, two, major, events, nucleation, and, crystal, growth, which, are, driven, by, thermodynamic, properties, as, well, as, chemical, properties, nucleation, is, the, step, where, the, solute, molecules, or, atoms, dispersed, in, the, solvent, start, to, gather, into, clusters, on, the, microscopic, scale, elevating, solute, concentration, in, a, small, region, that, become, stable, under, the, current, operating, conditions, these, stable, clusters, constitute, the, nuclei, therefore, the, clusters, need, to, reach, a, critical, size, in, order, to, become, stable, nuclei, such, critical, size, is, dictated, by, many, different, factors, temperature, supersaturation, etc, it, is, at, the, stage, of, nucleation, that, the, atoms, or, molecules, arrange, in, a, defined, and, periodic, manner, that, defines, the, crystal, structure, note, that, crystal, structure, is, a, special, term, that, refers, to, the, relative, arrangement, of, the, atoms, or, molecules, not, the, macroscopic, properties, of, the, crystal, size, and, shape, although, those, are, a, result, of, the, internal, crystal, structure, the, crystal, growth, is, the, subsequent, size, increase, of, the, nuclei, that, succeed, in, achieving, the, critical, cluster, size, crystal, growth, is, a, dynamic, process, occurring, in, equilibrium, where, solute, molecules, or, atoms, precipitate, out, of, solution, and, dissolve, back, into, solution, supersaturation, is, one, of, the, driving, forces, of, crystallization, as, the, solubility, of, a, species, is, an, equilibrium, process, quantified, by, k, sp, depending, upon, the, conditions, either, nucleation, or, growth, may, be, predominant, over, the, other, dictating, crystal, size, many, compounds, have, the, ability, to, crystallize, with, some, having, different, crystal, structures, a, phenomenon, called, polymorphism, certain, polymorphs, may, be, metastable, meaning, that, although, it, is, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, it, is, kinetically, stable, and, requires, some, input, of, energy, to, initiate, a, transformation, to, the, equilibrium, phase, each, polymorph, is, in, fact, a, different, thermodynamic, solid, state, and, crystal, polymorphs, of, the, same, compound, exhibit, different, physical, properties, such, as, dissolution, rate, shape, angles, between, facets, and, facet, growth, rates, melting, point, etc, for, this, reason, polymorphism, is, of, major, importance, in, industrial, manufacture, of, crystalline, products, additionally, crystal, phases, can, sometimes, be, interconverted, by, varying, factors, such, as, temperature, such, as, in, the, transformation, of, anatase, to, rutile, phases, of, titanium, dioxide, there, are, many, examples, of, natural, process, that, involve, crystallization, geological, time, scale, process, examples, include, human, time, scale, process, examples, include, crystal, formation, can, be, divided, into, two, types, where, the, first, type, of, crystals, are, composed, of, a, cation, and, anion, also, known, as, a, salt, such, as, sodium, acetate, the, second, type, of, crystals, are, composed, of, uncharged, species, for, example, menthol, crystal, formation, can, be, achieved, by, various, methods, such, as, cooling, evaporation, addition, of, a, second, solvent, to, reduce, the, solubility, of, the, solute, technique, known, as, antisolvent, or, drown, out, solvent, layering, sublimation, changing, the, cation, or, anion, as, well, as, other, methods, the, formation, of, a, supersaturated, solution, does, not, guarantee, crystal, formation, and, often, a, seed, crystal, or, scratching, the, glass, is, required, to, form, nucleation, sites, a, typical, laboratory, technique, for, crystal, formation, is, to, dissolve, the, solid, in, a, solution, in, which, it, is, partially, soluble, usually, at, high, temperatures, to, obtain, supersaturation, the, hot, mixture, is, then, filtered, to, remove, any, insoluble, impurities, the, filtrate, is, allowed, to, slowly, cool, crystals, that, form, are, then, filtered, and, washed, with, a, solvent, in, which, they, are, not, soluble, but, is, miscible, with, the, mother, liquor, the, process, is, then, repeated, to, increase, the, purity, in, a, technique, known, as, recrystallization, for, biological, molecules, in, which, the, solvent, channels, continue, to, be, present, to, retain, the, three, dimensional, structure, intact, microbatch, crystallization, under, oil, and, vapor, diffusion, methods, have, been, the, common, methods, equipment, for, the, main, industrial, processes, for, crystallization, the, crystallization, process, appears, to, violate, the, second, principle, of, thermodynamics, whereas, most, processes, that, yield, more, orderly, results, are, achieved, by, applying, heat, crystals, usually, form, at, lower, temperatures, especially, by, supercooling, however, due, to, the, release, of, the, heat, of, fusion, during, crystallization, the, entropy, of, the, universe, increases, thus, this, principle, remains, unaltered, the, molecules, within, a, pure, perfect, crystal, when, heated, by, an, external, source, will, become, liquid, this, occurs, at, a, sharply, defined, temperature, different, for, each, type, of, crystal, as, it, liquifies, the, complicated, architecture, of, the, crystal, collapses, melting, occurs, because, the, entropy, s, gain, in, the, system, by, spatial, randomization, of, the, molecules, has, overcome, the, enthalpy, h, loss, due, to, breaking, the, crystal, packing, forces, regarding, crystals, there, are, no, exceptions, to, this, rule, similarly, when, the, molten, crystal, is, cooled, the, molecules, will, return, to, their, crystalline, form, once, the, temperature, falls, beyond, the, turning, point, this, is, because, the, thermal, randomization, of, the, surroundings, compensates, for, the, loss, of, entropy, that, results, from, the, reordering, of, molecules, within, the, system, such, liquids, that, crystallize, on, cooling, are, the, exception, rather, than, the, rule, the, nature, of, a, crystallization, process, is, governed, by, both, thermodynamic, and, kinetic, factors, which, can, make, it, highly, variable, and, difficult, to, control, factors, such, as, impurity, level, mixing, regime, vessel, design, and, cooling, profile, can, have, a, major, impact, on, the, size, number, and, shape, of, crystals, produced, as, mentioned, above, a, crystal, is, formed, following, a, well, defined, pattern, or, structure, dictated, by, forces, acting, at, the, molecular, level, as, a, consequence, during, its, formation, process, the, crystal, is, in, an, environment, where, the, solute, concentration, reaches, a, certain, critical, value, before, changing, status, solid, formation, impossible, below, the, solubility, threshold, at, the, given, temperature, and, pressure, conditions, may, then, take, place, at, a, concentration, higher, than, the, theoretical, solubility, level, the, difference, between, the, actual, value, of, the, solute, concentration, at, the, crystallization, limit, and, the, theoretical, static, solubility, threshold, is, called, supersaturation, and, is, a, fundamental, factor, in, crystallization, nucleation, is, the, initiation, of, a, phase, change, in, a, small, region, such, as, the, formation, of, a, solid, crystal, from, a, liquid, solution, it, is, a, consequence, of, rapid, local, fluctuations, on, a, molecular, scale, in, a, homogeneous, phase, that, is, in, a, state, of, metastable, equilibrium, total, nucleation, is, the, sum, effect, of, two, categories, of, nucleation, primary, and, secondary, primary, nucleation, is, the, initial, formation, of, a, crystal, where, there, are, no, other, crystals, present, or, where, if, there, are, crystals, present, in, the, system, they, do, not, have, any, influence, on, the, process, this, can, occur, in, two, conditions, the, first, is, homogeneous, nucleation, which, is, nucleation, that, is, not, influenced, in, any, way, by, solids, these, solids, include, the, walls, of, the, crystallizer, vessel, and, particles, of, any, foreign, substance, the, second, category, then, is, heterogeneous, nucleation, this, occurs, when, solid, particles, of, foreign, substances, cause, an, increase, in, the, rate, of, nucleation, that, would, otherwise, not, be, seen, without, the, existence, of, these, foreign, particles, homogeneous, nucleation, rarely, occurs, in, practice, due, to, the, high, energy, necessary, to, begin, nucleation, without, a, solid, surface, to, catalyze, the, nucleation, primary, nucleation, both, homogeneous, and, heterogeneous, has, been, modeled, as, follows, where, secondary, nucleation, is, the, formation, of, nuclei, attributable, to, the, influence, of, the, existing, microscopic, crystals, in, the, magma, more, simply, put, secondary, nucleation, is, when, crystal, growth, is, initiated, with, contact, of, other, existing, crystals, or, seeds, the, first, type, of, known, secondary, crystallization, is, attributable, to, fluid, shear, the, other, due, to, collisions, between, already, existing, crystals, with, either, a, solid, surface, of, the, crystallizer, or, with, other, crystals, themselves, fluid, shear, nucleation, occurs, when, liquid, travels, across, a, crystal, at, a, high, speed, sweeping, away, nuclei, that, would, otherwise, be, incorporated, into, a, crystal, causing, the, swept, away, nuclei, to, become, new, crystals, contact, nucleation, has, been, found, to, be, the, most, effective, and, common, method, for, nucleation, the, benefits, include, the, following, the, following, model, although, somewhat, simplified, is, often, used, to, model, secondary, nucleation, where, once, the, first, small, crystal, the, nucleus, forms, it, acts, as, a, convergence, point, if, unstable, due, to, supersaturation, for, molecules, of, solute, touching, or, adjacent, to, the, crystal, so, that, it, increases, its, own, dimension, in, successive, layers, the, pattern, of, growth, resembles, the, rings, of, an, onion, as, shown, in, the, picture, where, each, colour, indicates, the, same, mass, of, solute, this, mass, creates, increasingly, thin, layers, due, to, the, increasing, surface, area, of, the, growing, crystal, the, supersaturated, solute, mass, the, original, nucleus, may, capture, in, a, time, unit, is, called, the, growth, rate, expressed, in, kg, m, 2, h, and, is, a, constant, specific, to, the, process, growth, rate, is, influenced, by, several, physical, factors, such, as, surface, tension, of, solution, pressure, temperature, relative, crystal, velocity, in, the, solution, reynolds, number, and, so, forth, the, main, values, to, control, are, therefore, the, first, value, is, a, consequence, of, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, solution, while, the, others, define, a, difference, between, a, well, and, poorly, designed, crystallizer, the, appearance, and, size, range, of, a, crystalline, product, is, extremely, important, in, crystallization, if, further, processing, of, the, crystals, is, desired, large, crystals, with, uniform, size, are, important, for, washing, filtering, transportation, and, storage, because, large, crystals, are, easier, to, filter, out, of, a, solution, than, small, crystals, also, larger, crystals, have, a, smaller, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, leading, to, a, higher, purity, this, higher, purity, is, due, to, less, retention, of, mother, liquor, which, contains, impurities, and, a, smaller, loss, of, yield, when, the, crystals, are, washed, to, remove, the, mother, liquor, in, special, cases, for, example, during, drug, manufacturing, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, small, crystal, sizes, are, often, desired, to, improve, drug, dissolution, rate, and, bio, availability, the, theoretical, crystal, size, distribution, can, be, estimated, as, a, function, of, operating, conditions, with, a, fairly, complicated, mathematical, process, called, population, balance, theory, using, population, balance, equations, some, of, the, important, factors, influencing, solubility, are, so, one, may, identify, two, main, families, of, crystallization, processes, this, division, is, not, really, clear, cut, since, hybrid, systems, exist, where, cooling, is, performed, through, evaporation, thus, obtaining, at, the, same, time, a, concentration, of, the, solution, a, crystallization, process, often, referred, to, in, chemical, engineering, is, the, fractional, crystallization, this, is, not, a, different, process, rather, a, special, application, of, one, or, both, of, the, above, most, chemical, compounds, dissolved, in, most, solvents, show, the, so, called, direct, solubility, that, is, the, solubility, threshold, increases, with, temperature, so, whenever, the, conditions, are, favorable, crystal, formation, results, from, simply, cooling, the, solution, here, cooling, is, a, relative, term, austenite, crystals, in, a, steel, form, well, above, 1000, c, an, example, of, this, crystallization, process, is, the, production, of, glauber, s, salt, a, crystalline, form, of, sodium, sulfate, in, the, diagram, where, equilibrium, temperature, is, on, the, x, axis, and, equilibrium, concentration, as, mass, percent, of, solute, in, saturated, solution, in, y, axis, it, is, clear, that, sulfate, solubility, quickly, decreases, below, 32, 5, c, assuming, a, saturated, solution, at, 30, c, by, cooling, it, to, 0, c, note, that, this, is, possible, thanks, to, the, freezing, point, depression, the, precipitation, of, a, mass, of, sulfate, occurs, corresponding, to, the, change, in, solubility, from, 29, equilibrium, value, at, 30, c, to, approximately, 4, 5, at, 0, c, actually, a, larger, crystal, mass, is, precipitated, since, sulfate, entrains, hydration, water, and, this, has, the, side, effect, of, increasing, the, final, concentration, there, are, limitations, in, the, use, of, cooling, crystallization, the, simplest, cooling, crystallizers, are, tanks, provided, with, a, mixer, for, internal, circulation, where, temperature, decrease, is, obtained, by, heat, exchange, with, an, intermediate, fluid, circulating, in, a, jacket, these, simple, machines, are, used, in, batch, processes, as, in, processing, of, pharmaceuticals, and, are, prone, to, scaling, batch, processes, normally, provide, a, relatively, variable, quality, of, the, product, along, with, the, batch, the, swenson, walker, crystallizer, is, a, model, specifically, conceived, by, swenson, co, around, 1920, having, a, semicylindric, horizontal, hollow, trough, in, which, a, hollow, screw, conveyor, or, some, hollow, discs, in, which, a, refrigerating, fluid, is, circulated, plunge, during, rotation, on, a, longitudinal, axis, the, refrigerating, fluid, is, sometimes, also, circulated, in, a, jacket, around, the, trough, crystals, precipitate, on, the, cold, surfaces, of, the, screw, discs, from, which, they, are, removed, by, scrapers, and, settle, on, the, bottom, of, the, trough, the, screw, if, provided, pushes, the, slurry, towards, a, discharge, port, a, common, practice, is, to, cool, the, solutions, by, flash, evaporation, when, a, liquid, at, a, given, t, 0, temperature, is, transferred, in, a, chamber, at, a, pressure, p, 1, such, that, the, liquid, saturation, temperature, t, 1, at, p, 1, is, lower, than, t, 0, the, liquid, will, release, heat, according, to, the, temperature, difference, and, a, quantity, of, solvent, whose, total, latent, heat, of, vaporization, equals, the, difference, in, enthalpy, in, simple, words, the, liquid, is, cooled, by, evaporating, a, part, of, it, in, the, sugar, industry, vertical, cooling, crystallizers, are, used, to, exhaust, the, molasses, in, the, last, crystallization, stage, downstream, of, vacuum, pans, prior, to, centrifugation, the, massecuite, enters, the, crystallizers, at, the, top, and, cooling, water, is, pumped, through, pipes, in, counterflow, another, option, is, to, obtain, at, an, approximately, constant, temperature, the, precipitation, of, the, crystals, by, increasing, the, solute, concentration, above, the, solubility, threshold, to, obtain, this, the, solute, solvent, mass, ratio, is, increased, using, the, technique, of, evaporation, this, process, is, insensitive, to, change, in, temperature, as, long, as, hydration, state, remains, unchanged, all, considerations, on, control, of, crystallization, parameters, are, the, same, as, for, the, cooling, models, most, industrial, crystallizers, are, of, the, evaporative, type, such, as, the, very, large, sodium, chloride, and, sucrose, units, whose, production, accounts, for, more, than, 50, of, the, total, world, production, of, crystals, the, most, common, type, is, the, forced, circulation, fc, model, see, evaporator, a, pumping, device, a, pump, or, an, axial, flow, mixer, keeps, the, crystal, slurry, in, homogeneous, suspension, throughout, the, tank, including, the, exchange, surfaces, by, controlling, pump, flow, control, of, the, contact, time, of, the, crystal, mass, with, the, supersaturated, solution, is, achieved, together, with, reasonable, velocities, at, the, exchange, surfaces, the, oslo, mentioned, above, is, a, refining, of, the, evaporative, forced, circulation, crystallizer, now, equipped, with, a, large, crystals, settling, zone, to, increase, the, retention, time, usually, low, in, the, fc, and, to, roughly, separate, heavy, slurry, zones, from, clear, liquid, evaporative, crystallizers, tend, to, yield, larger, average, crystal, size, and, narrows, the, crystal, size, distribution, curve, whichever, the, form, of, the, crystallizer, to, achieve, an, effective, process, control, it, is, important, to, control, the, retention, time, and, the, crystal, mass, to, obtain, the, optimum, conditions, in, terms, of, crystal, specific, surface, and, the, fastest, possible, growth, this, is, achieved, by, a, separation, to, put, it, simply, of, the, crystals, from, the, liquid, mass, in, order, to, manage, the, two, flows, in, a, different, way, the, practical, way, is, to, perform, a, gravity, settling, to, be, able, to, extract, and, possibly, recycle, separately, the, almost, clear, liquid, while, managing, the, mass, flow, around, the, crystallizer, to, obtain, a, precise, slurry, density, elsewhere, a, typical, example, is, the, dtb, draft, tube, and, baffle, crystallizer, an, idea, of, richard, chisum, bennett, a, swenson, engineer, and, later, president, of, swenson, at, the, end, of, the, 1950s, the, dtb, crystallizer, see, images, has, an, internal, circulator, typically, an, axial, flow, mixer, yellow, pushing, upwards, in, a, draft, tube, while, outside, the, crystallizer, there, is, a, settling, area, in, an, annulus, in, it, the, exhaust, solution, moves, upwards, at, a, very, low, velocity, so, that, large, crystals, settle, and, return, to, the, main, circulation, while, only, the, fines, below, a, given, grain, size, are, extracted, and, eventually, destroyed, by, increasing, or, decreasing, temperature, thus, creating, additional, supersaturation, a, quasi, perfect, control, of, all, parameters, is, achieved, as, dtf, crystallizers, offer, superior, control, over, crystal, size, and, characteristics, this, crystallizer, and, the, derivative, models, krystal, csc, etc, could, be, the, ultimate, solution, if, not, for, a, major, limitation, in, the, evaporative, capacity, due, to, the, limited, diameter, of, the, vapor, head, and, the, relatively, low, external, circulation, not, allowing, large, amounts, of, energy, to, be, supplied, to, the, system
