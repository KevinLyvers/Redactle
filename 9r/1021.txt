nuclear, fusion, is, a, reaction, in, which, two, or, more, atomic, nuclei, usually, deuterium, and, tritium, hydrogen, isotopes, combine, to, form, one, or, more, different, atomic, nuclei, and, subatomic, particles, neutrons, or, protons, the, difference, in, mass, between, the, reactants, and, products, is, manifested, as, either, the, release, or, absorption, of, energy, this, difference, in, mass, arises, due, to, the, difference, in, nuclear, binding, energy, between, the, atomic, nuclei, before, and, after, the, reaction, nuclear, fusion, is, the, process, that, powers, active, or, main, sequence, stars, and, other, high, magnitude, stars, where, large, amounts, of, energy, are, released, a, nuclear, fusion, process, that, produces, atomic, nuclei, lighter, than, iron, 56, or, nickel, 62, will, generally, release, energy, these, elements, have, a, relatively, small, mass, and, a, relatively, large, binding, energy, per, nucleon, fusion, of, nuclei, lighter, than, these, releases, energy, an, exothermic, process, while, the, fusion, of, heavier, nuclei, results, in, energy, retained, by, the, product, nucleons, and, the, resulting, reaction, is, endothermic, the, opposite, is, true, for, the, reverse, process, called, nuclear, fission, nuclear, fusion, uses, lighter, elements, such, as, hydrogen, and, helium, which, are, in, general, more, fusible, while, the, heavier, elements, such, as, uranium, thorium, and, plutonium, are, more, fissionable, the, extreme, astrophysical, event, of, a, supernova, can, produce, enough, energy, to, fuse, nuclei, into, elements, heavier, than, iron, american, chemist, william, draper, harkins, was, the, first, to, propose, the, concept, of, nuclear, fusion, in, 1915, then, in, 1921, arthur, eddington, suggested, hydrogen, helium, fusion, could, be, the, primary, source, of, stellar, energy, quantum, tunneling, was, discovered, by, friedrich, hund, in, 1927, and, shortly, afterwards, robert, atkinson, and, fritz, houtermans, used, the, measured, masses, of, light, elements, to, demonstrate, that, large, amounts, of, energy, could, be, released, by, fusing, small, nuclei, building, on, the, early, experiments, in, artificial, nuclear, transmutation, by, patrick, blackett, laboratory, fusion, of, hydrogen, isotopes, was, accomplished, by, mark, oliphant, in, 1932, in, the, remainder, of, that, decade, the, theory, of, the, main, cycle, of, nuclear, fusion, in, stars, was, worked, out, by, hans, bethe, research, into, fusion, for, military, purposes, began, in, the, early, 1940s, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, self, sustaining, nuclear, fusion, was, first, carried, out, on, 1, november, 1952, in, the, ivy, mike, hydrogen, thermonuclear, bomb, test, while, fusion, was, achieved, in, the, operation, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, h, bomb, the, reaction, must, be, controlled, and, sustained, in, order, for, it, to, be, a, useful, energy, source, research, into, developing, controlled, fusion, inside, fusion, reactors, has, been, ongoing, since, the, 1930s, but, the, technology, is, still, in, its, developmental, phase, the, us, national, ignition, facility, which, uses, laser, driven, inertial, confinement, fusion, was, designed, with, a, goal, of, break, even, fusion, the, first, large, scale, laser, target, experiments, were, performed, in, june, 2009, and, ignition, experiments, began, in, early, 2011, on, 13, december, 2022, the, united, states, department, of, energy, announced, that, on, 5, december, 2022, they, had, successfully, accomplished, break, even, fusion, delivering, 2, 05, megajoules, mj, of, energy, to, the, target, resulting, in, 3, 15, mj, of, fusion, energy, output, prior, to, this, breakthrough, controlled, fusion, reactions, had, been, unable, to, produce, break, even, self, sustaining, controlled, fusion, the, two, most, advanced, approaches, for, it, are, magnetic, confinement, toroid, designs, and, inertial, confinement, laser, designs, workable, designs, for, a, toroidal, reactor, that, theoretically, will, deliver, ten, times, more, fusion, energy, than, the, amount, needed, to, heat, plasma, to, the, required, temperatures, are, in, development, see, iter, the, iter, facility, is, expected, to, finish, its, construction, phase, in, 2025, it, will, start, commissioning, the, reactor, that, same, year, and, initiate, plasma, experiments, in, 2025, but, is, not, expected, to, begin, full, deuterium, tritium, fusion, until, 2035, private, companies, pursuing, the, commercialization, of, nuclear, fusion, received, 2, 6, billion, in, private, funding, in, 2021, alone, going, to, many, notable, startups, including, but, not, limited, to, commonwealth, fusion, systems, helion, energy, inc, general, fusion, tae, technologies, inc, and, zap, energy, inc, the, release, of, energy, with, the, fusion, of, light, elements, is, due, to, the, interplay, of, two, opposing, forces, the, nuclear, force, a, manifestation, of, the, strong, interaction, which, holds, protons, and, neutrons, tightly, together, in, the, atomic, nucleus, and, the, coulomb, force, which, causes, positively, charged, protons, in, the, nucleus, to, repel, each, other, lighter, nuclei, nuclei, smaller, than, iron, and, nickel, are, sufficiently, small, and, proton, poor, to, allow, the, nuclear, force, to, overcome, the, coulomb, force, this, is, because, the, nucleus, is, sufficiently, small, that, all, nucleons, feel, the, short, range, attractive, force, at, least, as, strongly, as, they, feel, the, infinite, range, coulomb, repulsion, building, up, nuclei, from, lighter, nuclei, by, fusion, releases, the, extra, energy, from, the, net, attraction, of, particles, for, larger, nuclei, however, no, energy, is, released, because, the, nuclear, force, is, short, range, and, cannot, act, across, larger, nuclei, fusion, powers, stars, and, produces, virtually, all, elements, in, a, process, called, nucleosynthesis, the, sun, is, a, main, sequence, star, and, as, such, generates, its, energy, by, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, nuclei, into, helium, in, its, core, the, sun, fuses, 620, million, metric, tons, of, hydrogen, and, makes, 616, million, metric, tons, of, helium, each, second, the, fusion, of, lighter, elements, in, stars, releases, energy, and, the, mass, that, always, accompanies, it, for, example, in, the, fusion, of, two, hydrogen, nuclei, to, form, helium, 0, 645, of, the, mass, is, carried, away, in, the, form, of, kinetic, energy, of, an, alpha, particle, or, other, forms, of, energy, such, as, electromagnetic, radiation, it, takes, considerable, energy, to, force, nuclei, to, fuse, even, those, of, the, lightest, element, hydrogen, when, accelerated, to, high, enough, speeds, nuclei, can, overcome, this, electrostatic, repulsion, and, be, brought, close, enough, such, that, the, attractive, nuclear, force, is, greater, than, the, repulsive, coulomb, force, the, strong, force, grows, rapidly, once, the, nuclei, are, close, enough, and, the, fusing, nucleons, can, essentially, fall, into, each, other, and, the, result, is, fusion, and, net, energy, produced, the, fusion, of, lighter, nuclei, which, creates, a, heavier, nucleus, and, often, a, free, neutron, or, proton, generally, releases, more, energy, than, it, takes, to, force, the, nuclei, together, this, is, an, exothermic, process, that, can, produce, self, sustaining, reactions, energy, released, in, most, nuclear, reactions, is, much, larger, than, in, chemical, reactions, because, the, binding, energy, that, holds, a, nucleus, together, is, greater, than, the, energy, that, holds, electrons, to, a, nucleus, for, example, the, ionization, energy, gained, by, adding, an, electron, to, a, hydrogen, nucleus, is, 13, 6, ev, less, than, one, millionth, of, the, 17, 6, mev, released, in, the, deuterium, tritium, d, t, reaction, shown, in, the, adjacent, diagram, fusion, reactions, have, an, energy, density, many, times, greater, than, nuclear, fission, the, reactions, produce, far, greater, energy, per, unit, of, mass, even, though, individual, fission, reactions, are, generally, much, more, energetic, than, individual, fusion, ones, which, are, themselves, millions, of, times, more, energetic, than, chemical, reactions, only, direct, conversion, of, mass, into, energy, such, as, that, caused, by, the, annihilatory, collision, of, matter, and, antimatter, is, more, energetic, per, unit, of, mass, than, nuclear, fusion, the, complete, conversion, of, one, gram, of, matter, would, release, 9, 10, 13, joules, of, energy, an, important, fusion, process, is, the, stellar, nucleosynthesis, that, powers, stars, including, the, sun, in, the, 20th, century, it, was, recognized, that, the, energy, released, from, nuclear, fusion, reactions, accounts, for, the, longevity, of, stellar, heat, and, light, the, fusion, of, nuclei, in, a, star, starting, from, its, initial, hydrogen, and, helium, abundance, provides, that, energy, and, synthesizes, new, nuclei, different, reaction, chains, are, involved, depending, on, the, mass, of, the, star, and, therefore, the, pressure, and, temperature, in, its, core, around, 1920, arthur, eddington, anticipated, the, discovery, and, mechanism, of, nuclear, fusion, processes, in, stars, in, his, paper, the, internal, constitution, of, the, stars, at, that, time, the, source, of, stellar, energy, was, unknown, eddington, correctly, speculated, that, the, source, was, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, liberating, enormous, energy, according, to, einstein, s, equation, e, mc, 2, this, was, a, particularly, remarkable, development, since, at, that, time, fusion, and, thermonuclear, energy, had, not, yet, been, discovered, nor, even, that, stars, are, largely, composed, of, hydrogen, see, metallicity, eddington, s, paper, reasoned, that, all, of, these, speculations, were, proven, correct, in, the, following, decades, the, primary, source, of, solar, energy, and, that, of, similar, size, stars, is, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, to, form, helium, the, proton, proton, chain, reaction, which, occurs, at, a, solar, core, temperature, of, 14, million, kelvin, the, net, result, is, the, fusion, of, four, protons, into, one, alpha, particle, with, the, release, of, two, positrons, and, two, neutrinos, which, changes, two, of, the, protons, into, neutrons, and, energy, in, heavier, stars, the, cno, cycle, and, other, processes, are, more, important, as, a, star, uses, up, a, substantial, fraction, of, its, hydrogen, it, begins, to, synthesize, heavier, elements, the, heaviest, elements, are, synthesized, by, fusion, that, occurs, when, a, more, massive, star, undergoes, a, violent, supernova, at, the, end, of, its, life, a, process, known, as, supernova, nucleosynthesis, a, substantial, energy, barrier, of, electrostatic, forces, must, be, overcome, before, fusion, can, occur, at, large, distances, two, naked, nuclei, repel, one, another, because, of, the, repulsive, electrostatic, force, between, their, positively, charged, protons, if, two, nuclei, can, be, brought, close, enough, together, however, the, electrostatic, repulsion, can, be, overcome, by, the, quantum, effect, in, which, nuclei, can, tunnel, through, coulomb, forces, when, a, nucleon, such, as, a, proton, or, neutron, is, added, to, a, nucleus, the, nuclear, force, attracts, it, to, all, the, other, nucleons, of, the, nucleus, if, the, atom, is, small, enough, but, primarily, to, its, immediate, neighbors, due, to, the, short, range, of, the, force, the, nucleons, in, the, interior, of, a, nucleus, have, more, neighboring, nucleons, than, those, on, the, surface, since, smaller, nuclei, have, a, larger, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, the, binding, energy, per, nucleon, due, to, the, nuclear, force, generally, increases, with, the, size, of, the, nucleus, but, approaches, a, limiting, value, corresponding, to, that, of, a, nucleus, with, a, diameter, of, about, four, nucleons, it, is, important, to, keep, in, mind, that, nucleons, are, quantum, objects, so, for, example, since, two, neutrons, in, a, nucleus, are, identical, to, each, other, the, goal, of, distinguishing, one, from, the, other, such, as, which, one, is, in, the, interior, and, which, is, on, the, surface, is, in, fact, meaningless, and, the, inclusion, of, quantum, mechanics, is, therefore, necessary, for, proper, calculations, the, electrostatic, force, on, the, other, hand, is, an, inverse, square, force, so, a, proton, added, to, a, nucleus, will, feel, an, electrostatic, repulsion, from, all, the, other, protons, in, the, nucleus, the, electrostatic, energy, per, nucleon, due, to, the, electrostatic, force, thus, increases, without, limit, as, nuclei, atomic, number, grows, the, net, result, of, the, opposing, electrostatic, and, strong, nuclear, forces, is, that, the, binding, energy, per, nucleon, generally, increases, with, increasing, size, up, to, the, elements, iron, and, nickel, and, then, decreases, for, heavier, nuclei, eventually, the, binding, energy, becomes, negative, and, very, heavy, nuclei, all, with, more, than, 208, nucleons, corresponding, to, a, diameter, of, about, 6, nucleons, are, not, stable, the, four, most, tightly, bound, nuclei, in, decreasing, order, of, binding, energy, per, nucleon, are, 62, ni, 58, fe, 56, fe, and, 60, ni, even, though, the, nickel, isotope, 62, ni, is, more, stable, the, iron, isotope, 56, fe, is, an, order, of, magnitude, more, common, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, there, is, no, easy, way, for, stars, to, create, 62, ni, through, the, alpha, process, an, exception, to, this, general, trend, is, the, helium, 4, nucleus, whose, binding, energy, is, higher, than, that, of, lithium, the, next, heavier, element, this, is, because, protons, and, neutrons, are, fermions, which, according, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, cannot, exist, in, the, same, nucleus, in, exactly, the, same, state, each, proton, or, neutron, s, energy, state, in, a, nucleus, can, accommodate, both, a, spin, up, particle, and, a, spin, down, particle, helium, 4, has, an, anomalously, large, binding, energy, because, its, nucleus, consists, of, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, it, is, a, doubly, magic, nucleus, so, all, four, of, its, nucleons, can, be, in, the, ground, state, any, additional, nucleons, would, have, to, go, into, higher, energy, states, indeed, the, helium, 4, nucleus, is, so, tightly, bound, that, it, is, commonly, treated, as, a, single, quantum, mechanical, particle, in, nuclear, physics, namely, the, alpha, particle, the, situation, is, similar, if, two, nuclei, are, brought, together, as, they, approach, each, other, all, the, protons, in, one, nucleus, repel, all, the, protons, in, the, other, not, until, the, two, nuclei, actually, come, close, enough, for, long, enough, so, the, strong, attractive, nuclear, force, can, take, over, and, overcome, the, repulsive, electrostatic, force, this, can, also, be, described, as, the, nuclei, overcoming, the, so, called, coulomb, barrier, the, kinetic, energy, to, achieve, this, can, be, lower, than, the, barrier, itself, because, of, quantum, tunneling, the, coulomb, barrier, is, smallest, for, isotopes, of, hydrogen, as, their, nuclei, contain, only, a, single, positive, charge, a, diproton, is, not, stable, so, neutrons, must, also, be, involved, ideally, in, such, a, way, that, a, helium, nucleus, with, its, extremely, tight, binding, is, one, of, the, products, using, deuterium, tritium, fuel, the, resulting, energy, barrier, is, about, 0, 1, mev, in, comparison, the, energy, needed, to, remove, an, electron, from, hydrogen, is, 13, 6, ev, the, intermediate, result, of, the, fusion, is, an, unstable, 5, he, nucleus, which, immediately, ejects, a, neutron, with, 14, 1, mev, the, recoil, energy, of, the, remaining, 4, he, nucleus, is, 3, 5, mev, so, the, total, energy, liberated, is, 17, 6, mev, this, is, many, times, more, than, what, was, needed, to, overcome, the, energy, barrier, the, reaction, cross, section, is, a, measure, of, the, probability, of, a, fusion, reaction, as, a, function, of, the, relative, velocity, of, the, two, reactant, nuclei, if, the, reactants, have, a, distribution, of, velocities, e, g, a, thermal, distribution, then, it, is, useful, to, perform, an, average, over, the, distributions, of, the, product, of, cross, section, and, velocity, this, average, is, called, the, reactivity, denoted, v, the, reaction, rate, fusions, per, volume, per, time, is, v, times, the, product, of, the, reactant, number, densities, if, a, species, of, nuclei, is, reacting, with, a, nucleus, like, itself, such, as, the, dd, reaction, then, the, product, n, 1, n, 2, displaystyle, n, 1, n, 2, must, be, replaced, by, n, 2, 2, displaystyle, n, 2, 2, v, displaystyle, langle, sigma, v, rangle, increases, from, virtually, zero, at, room, temperatures, up, to, meaningful, magnitudes, at, temperatures, of, 10, 100, kev, at, these, temperatures, well, above, typical, ionization, energies, 13, 6, ev, in, the, hydrogen, case, the, fusion, reactants, exist, in, a, plasma, state, the, significance, of, v, displaystyle, langle, sigma, v, rangle, as, a, function, of, temperature, in, a, device, with, a, particular, energy, confinement, time, is, found, by, considering, the, lawson, criterion, this, is, an, extremely, challenging, barrier, to, overcome, on, earth, which, explains, why, fusion, research, has, taken, many, years, to, reach, the, current, advanced, technical, state, thermonuclear, fusion, is, the, process, of, atomic, nuclei, combining, or, fusing, using, high, temperatures, to, drive, them, close, enough, together, for, this, to, become, possible, such, temperatures, cause, the, matter, to, become, a, plasma, and, if, confined, fusion, reactions, may, occur, due, to, collisions, with, extreme, thermal, kinetic, energies, of, the, particles, there, are, two, forms, of, thermonuclear, fusion, uncontrolled, in, which, the, resulting, energy, is, released, in, an, uncontrolled, manner, as, it, is, in, thermonuclear, weapons, hydrogen, bombs, and, in, most, stars, and, controlled, where, the, fusion, reactions, take, place, in, an, environment, allowing, some, or, all, of, the, energy, released, to, be, harnessed, for, constructive, purposes, temperature, is, a, measure, of, the, average, kinetic, energy, of, particles, so, by, heating, the, material, it, will, gain, energy, after, reaching, sufficient, temperature, given, by, the, lawson, criterion, the, energy, of, accidental, collisions, within, the, plasma, is, high, enough, to, overcome, the, coulomb, barrier, and, the, particles, may, fuse, together, in, a, deuterium, tritium, fusion, reaction, for, example, the, energy, necessary, to, overcome, the, coulomb, barrier, is, 0, 1, mev, converting, between, energy, and, temperature, shows, that, the, 0, 1, mev, barrier, would, be, overcome, at, a, temperature, in, excess, of, 1, 2, billion, kelvin, there, are, two, effects, that, are, needed, to, lower, the, actual, temperature, one, is, the, fact, that, temperature, is, the, average, kinetic, energy, implying, that, some, nuclei, at, this, temperature, would, actually, have, much, higher, energy, than, 0, 1, mev, while, others, would, be, much, lower, it, is, the, nuclei, in, the, high, energy, tail, of, the, velocity, distribution, that, account, for, most, of, the, fusion, reactions, the, other, effect, is, quantum, tunnelling, the, nuclei, do, not, actually, have, to, have, enough, energy, to, overcome, the, coulomb, barrier, completely, if, they, have, nearly, enough, energy, they, can, tunnel, through, the, remaining, barrier, for, these, reasons, fuel, at, lower, temperatures, will, still, undergo, fusion, events, at, a, lower, rate, thermonuclear, fusion, is, one, of, the, methods, being, researched, in, the, attempts, to, produce, fusion, power, if, thermonuclear, fusion, becomes, favorable, to, use, it, would, significantly, reduce, the, world, s, carbon, footprint, accelerator, based, light, ion, fusion, is, a, technique, using, particle, accelerators, to, achieve, particle, kinetic, energies, sufficient, to, induce, light, ion, fusion, reactions, accelerating, light, ions, is, relatively, easy, and, can, be, done, in, an, efficient, manner, requiring, only, a, vacuum, tube, a, pair, of, electrodes, and, a, high, voltage, transformer, fusion, can, be, observed, with, as, little, as, 10, kv, between, the, electrodes, the, system, can, be, arranged, to, accelerate, ions, into, a, static, fuel, infused, target, known, as, beam, target, fusion, or, by, accelerating, two, streams, of, ions, towards, each, other, beam, beam, fusion, the, key, problem, with, accelerator, based, fusion, and, with, cold, targets, in, general, is, that, fusion, cross, sections, are, many, orders, of, magnitude, lower, than, coulomb, interaction, cross, sections, therefore, the, vast, majority, of, ions, expend, their, energy, emitting, bremsstrahlung, radiation, and, the, ionization, of, atoms, of, the, target, devices, referred, to, as, sealed, tube, neutron, generators, are, particularly, relevant, to, this, discussion, these, small, devices, are, miniature, particle, accelerators, filled, with, deuterium, and, tritium, gas, in, an, arrangement, that, allows, ions, of, those, nuclei, to, be, accelerated, against, hydride, targets, also, containing, deuterium, and, tritium, where, fusion, takes, place, releasing, a, flux, of, neutrons, hundreds, of, neutron, generators, are, produced, annually, for, use, in, the, petroleum, industry, where, they, are, used, in, measurement, equipment, for, locating, and, mapping, oil, reserves, a, number, of, attempts, to, recirculate, the, ions, that, miss, collisions, have, been, made, over, the, years, one, of, the, better, known, attempts, in, the, 1970s, was, migma, which, used, a, unique, particle, storage, ring, to, capture, ions, into, circular, orbits, and, return, them, to, the, reaction, area, theoretical, calculations, made, during, funding, reviews, pointed, out, that, the, system, would, have, significant, difficulty, scaling, up, to, contain, enough, fusion, fuel, to, be, relevant, as, a, power, source, in, the, 1990s, a, new, arrangement, using, a, field, reversed, configuration, frc, as, the, storage, system, was, proposed, by, norman, rostoker, and, continues, to, be, studied, by, tae, technologies, as, of, 2021, a, closely, related, approach, is, to, merge, two, frc, s, rotating, in, opposite, directions, which, is, being, actively, studied, by, helion, energy, because, these, approaches, all, have, ion, energies, well, beyond, the, coulomb, barrier, they, often, suggest, the, use, of, alternative, fuel, cycles, like, p, 11, b, that, are, too, difficult, to, attempt, using, conventional, approaches, muon, catalyzed, fusion, is, a, fusion, process, that, occurs, at, ordinary, temperatures, it, was, studied, in, detail, by, steven, jones, in, the, early, 1980s, net, energy, production, from, this, reaction, has, been, unsuccessful, because, of, the, high, energy, required, to, create, muons, their, short, 2, 2, s, half, life, and, the, high, chance, that, a, muon, will, bind, to, the, new, alpha, particle, and, thus, stop, catalyzing, fusion, some, other, confinement, principles, have, been, investigated, the, key, problem, in, achieving, thermonuclear, fusion, is, how, to, confine, the, hot, plasma, due, to, the, high, temperature, the, plasma, cannot, be, in, direct, contact, with, any, solid, material, so, it, has, to, be, located, in, a, vacuum, also, high, temperatures, imply, high, pressures, the, plasma, tends, to, expand, immediately, and, some, force, is, necessary, to, act, against, it, this, force, can, take, one, of, three, forms, gravitation, in, stars, magnetic, forces, in, magnetic, confinement, fusion, reactors, or, inertial, as, the, fusion, reaction, may, occur, before, the, plasma, starts, to, expand, so, the, plasma, s, inertia, is, keeping, the, material, together, one, force, capable, of, confining, the, fuel, well, enough, to, satisfy, the, lawson, criterion, is, gravity, the, mass, needed, however, is, so, great, that, gravitational, confinement, is, only, found, in, stars, the, least, massive, stars, capable, of, sustained, fusion, are, red, dwarfs, while, brown, dwarfs, are, able, to, fuse, deuterium, and, lithium, if, they, are, of, sufficient, mass, in, stars, heavy, enough, after, the, supply, of, hydrogen, is, exhausted, in, their, cores, their, cores, or, a, shell, around, the, core, start, fusing, helium, to, carbon, in, the, most, massive, stars, at, least, 8, 11, solar, masses, the, process, is, continued, until, some, of, their, energy, is, produced, by, fusing, lighter, elements, to, iron, as, iron, has, one, of, the, highest, binding, energies, reactions, producing, heavier, elements, are, generally, endothermic, therefore, significant, amounts, of, heavier, elements, are, not, formed, during, stable, periods, of, massive, star, evolution, but, are, formed, in, supernova, explosions, some, lighter, stars, also, form, these, elements, in, the, outer, parts, of, the, stars, over, long, periods, of, time, by, absorbing, energy, from, fusion, in, the, inside, of, the, star, by, absorbing, neutrons, that, are, emitted, from, the, fusion, process, all, of, the, elements, heavier, than, iron, have, some, potential, energy, to, release, in, theory, at, the, extremely, heavy, end, of, element, production, these, heavier, elements, can, produce, energy, in, the, process, of, being, split, again, back, toward, the, size, of, iron, in, the, process, of, nuclear, fission, nuclear, fission, thus, releases, energy, that, has, been, stored, sometimes, billions, of, years, before, during, stellar, nucleosynthesis, electrically, charged, particles, such, as, fuel, ions, will, follow, magnetic, field, lines, see, guiding, centre, the, fusion, fuel, can, therefore, be, trapped, using, a, strong, magnetic, field, a, variety, of, magnetic, configurations, exist, including, the, toroidal, geometries, of, tokamaks, and, stellarators, and, open, ended, mirror, confinement, systems, a, third, confinement, principle, is, to, apply, a, rapid, pulse, of, energy, to, a, large, part, of, the, surface, of, a, pellet, of, fusion, fuel, causing, it, to, simultaneously, implode, and, heat, to, very, high, pressure, and, temperature, if, the, fuel, is, dense, enough, and, hot, enough, the, fusion, reaction, rate, will, be, high, enough, to, burn, a, significant, fraction, of, the, fuel, before, it, has, dissipated, to, achieve, these, extreme, conditions, the, initially, cold, fuel, must, be, explosively, compressed, inertial, confinement, is, used, in, the, hydrogen, bomb, where, the, driver, is, x, rays, created, by, a, fission, bomb, inertial, confinement, is, also, attempted, in, controlled, nuclear, fusion, where, the, driver, is, a, laser, ion, or, electron, beam, or, a, z, pinch, another, method, is, to, use, conventional, high, explosive, material, to, compress, a, fuel, to, fusion, conditions, the, utias, explosive, driven, implosion, facility, was, used, to, produce, stable, centred, and, focused, hemispherical, implosions, to, generate, neutrons, from, d, d, reactions, the, simplest, and, most, direct, method, proved, to, be, in, a, predetonated, stoichiometric, mixture, of, deuterium, oxygen, the, other, successful, method, was, using, a, miniature, voitenko, compressor, where, a, plane, diaphragm, was, driven, by, the, implosion, wave, into, a, secondary, small, spherical, cavity, that, contained, pure, deuterium, gas, at, one, atmosphere, there, are, also, electrostatic, confinement, fusion, devices, these, devices, confine, ions, using, electrostatic, fields, the, best, known, is, the, fusor, this, device, has, a, cathode, inside, an, anode, wire, cage, positive, ions, fly, towards, the, negative, inner, cage, and, are, heated, by, the, electric, field, in, the, process, if, they, miss, the, inner, cage, they, can, collide, and, fuse, ions, typically, hit, the, cathode, however, creating, prohibitory, high, conduction, losses, also, fusion, rates, in, fusors, are, very, low, due, to, competing, physical, effects, such, as, energy, loss, in, the, form, of, light, radiation, designs, have, been, proposed, to, avoid, the, problems, associated, with, the, cage, by, generating, the, field, using, a, non, neutral, cloud, these, include, a, plasma, oscillating, device, a, penning, trap, and, the, polywell, the, technology, is, relatively, immature, however, and, many, scientific, and, engineering, questions, remain, the, most, well, known, inertial, electrostatic, confinement, approach, is, the, fusor, starting, in, 1999, a, number, of, amateurs, have, been, able, to, do, amateur, fusion, using, these, homemade, devices, other, iec, devices, include, the, polywell, mix, pops, and, marble, concepts, at, the, temperatures, and, densities, in, stellar, cores, the, rates, of, fusion, reactions, are, notoriously, slow, for, example, at, solar, core, temperature, t, 15, mk, and, density, 160, g, cm, 3, the, energy, release, rate, is, only, 276, w, cm, 3, about, a, quarter, of, the, volumetric, rate, at, which, a, resting, human, body, generates, heat, thus, reproduction, of, stellar, core, conditions, in, a, lab, for, nuclear, fusion, power, production, is, completely, impractical, because, nuclear, reaction, rates, depend, on, density, as, well, as, temperature, and, most, fusion, schemes, operate, at, relatively, low, densities, those, methods, are, strongly, dependent, on, higher, temperatures, the, fusion, rate, as, a, function, of, temperature, exp, e, kt, leads, to, the, need, to, achieve, temperatures, in, terrestrial, reactors, 10, 100, times, higher, than, in, stellar, interiors, t, 0, 1, 1, 0, 10, 9, k, in, artificial, fusion, the, primary, fuel, is, not, constrained, to, be, protons, and, higher, temperatures, can, be, used, so, reactions, with, larger, cross, sections, are, chosen, another, concern, is, the, production, of, neutrons, which, activate, the, reactor, structure, radiologically, but, also, have, the, advantages, of, allowing, volumetric, extraction, of, the, fusion, energy, and, tritium, breeding, reactions, that, release, no, neutrons, are, referred, to, as, aneutronic, to, be, a, useful, energy, source, a, fusion, reaction, must, satisfy, several, criteria, it, must, few, reactions, meet, these, criteria, the, following, are, those, with, the, largest, cross, sections, for, reactions, with, two, products, the, energy, is, divided, between, them, in, inverse, proportion, to, their, masses, as, shown, in, most, reactions, with, three, products, the, distribution, of, energy, varies, for, reactions, that, can, result, in, more, than, one, set, of, products, the, branching, ratios, are, given, some, reaction, candidates, can, be, eliminated, at, once, the, d, 6, li, reaction, has, no, advantage, compared, to, p, 11, 5, b, because, it, is, roughly, as, difficult, to, burn, but, produces, substantially, more, neutrons, through, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, side, reactions, there, is, also, a, p, 7, 3, li, reaction, but, the, cross, section, is, far, too, low, except, possibly, when, t, i, 1, mev, but, at, such, high, temperatures, an, endothermic, direct, neutron, producing, reaction, also, becomes, very, significant, finally, there, is, also, a, p, 9, 4, be, reaction, which, is, not, only, difficult, to, burn, but, 9, 4, be, can, be, easily, induced, to, split, into, two, alpha, particles, and, a, neutron, in, addition, to, the, fusion, reactions, the, following, reactions, with, neutrons, are, important, in, order, to, breed, tritium, in, dry, fusion, bombs, and, some, proposed, fusion, reactors, the, latter, of, the, two, equations, was, unknown, when, the, u, s, conducted, the, castle, bravo, fusion, bomb, test, in, 1954, being, just, the, second, fusion, bomb, ever, tested, and, the, first, to, use, lithium, the, designers, of, the, castle, bravo, shrimp, had, understood, the, usefulness, of, 6, li, in, tritium, production, but, had, failed, to, recognize, that, 7, li, fission, would, greatly, increase, the, yield, of, the, bomb, while, 7, li, has, a, small, neutron, cross, section, for, low, neutron, energies, it, has, a, higher, cross, section, above, 5, mev, the, 15, mt, yield, was, 150, greater, than, the, predicted, 6, mt, and, caused, unexpected, exposure, to, fallout, to, evaluate, the, usefulness, of, these, reactions, in, addition, to, the, reactants, the, products, and, the, energy, released, one, needs, to, know, something, about, the, nuclear, cross, section, any, given, fusion, device, has, a, maximum, plasma, pressure, it, can, sustain, and, an, economical, device, would, always, operate, near, this, maximum, given, this, pressure, the, largest, fusion, output, is, obtained, when, the, temperature, is, chosen, so, that, v, t, 2, is, a, maximum, this, is, also, the, temperature, at, which, the, value, of, the, triple, product, nt, required, for, ignition, is, a, minimum, since, that, required, value, is, inversely, proportional, to, v, t, 2, see, lawson, criterion, a, plasma, is, ignited, if, the, fusion, reactions, produce, enough, power, to, maintain, the, temperature, without, external, heating, this, optimum, temperature, and, the, value, of, v, t, 2, at, that, temperature, is, given, for, a, few, of, these, reactions, in, the, following, table, note, that, many, of, the, reactions, form, chains, for, instance, a, reactor, fueled, with, 3, 1, t, and, 3, 2, he, creates, some, 2, 1, d, which, is, then, possible, to, use, in, the, 2, 1, d, 3, 2, he, reaction, if, the, energies, are, right, an, elegant, idea, is, to, combine, the, reactions, 8, and, 9, the, 3, 2, he, from, reaction, 8, can, react, with, 6, 3, li, in, reaction, 9, before, completely, thermalizing, this, produces, an, energetic, proton, which, in, turn, undergoes, reaction, 8, before, thermalizing, detailed, analysis, shows, that, this, idea, would, not, work, well, but, it, is, a, good, example, of, a, case, where, the, usual, assumption, of, a, maxwellian, plasma, is, not, appropriate, any, of, the, reactions, above, can, in, principle, be, the, basis, of, fusion, power, production, in, addition, to, the, temperature, and, cross, section, discussed, above, we, must, consider, the, total, energy, of, the, fusion, products, e, fus, the, energy, of, the, charged, fusion, products, e, ch, and, the, atomic, number, z, of, the, non, hydrogenic, reactant, specification, of, the, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, reaction, entails, some, difficulties, though, to, begin, with, one, must, average, over, the, two, branches, 2i, and, 2ii, more, difficult, is, to, decide, how, to, treat, the, 3, 1, t, and, 3, 2, he, products, 3, 1, t, burns, so, well, in, a, deuterium, plasma, that, it, is, almost, impossible, to, extract, from, the, plasma, the, 2, 1, d, 3, 2, he, reaction, is, optimized, at, a, much, higher, temperature, so, the, burnup, at, the, optimum, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, temperature, may, be, low, therefore, it, seems, reasonable, to, assume, the, 3, 1, t, but, not, the, 3, 2, he, gets, burned, up, and, adds, its, energy, to, the, net, reaction, which, means, the, total, reaction, would, be, the, sum, of, 2i, 2ii, and, 1, for, calculating, the, power, of, a, reactor, in, which, the, reaction, rate, is, determined, by, the, d, d, step, we, count, the, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, fusion, energy, per, d, d, reaction, as, e, fus, 4, 03, mev, 17, 6, mev, 50, 3, 27, mev, 50, 12, 5, mev, and, the, energy, in, charged, particles, as, e, ch, 4, 03, mev, 3, 5, mev, 50, 0, 82, mev, 50, 4, 2, mev, note, if, the, tritium, ion, reacts, with, a, deuteron, while, it, still, has, a, large, kinetic, energy, then, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, helium, 4, produced, may, be, quite, different, from, 3, 5, mev, so, this, calculation, of, energy, in, charged, particles, is, only, an, approximation, of, the, average, the, amount, of, energy, per, deuteron, consumed, is, 2, 5, of, this, or, 5, 0, mev, a, specific, energy, of, about, 225, million, mj, per, kilogram, of, deuterium, another, unique, aspect, of, the, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, reaction, is, that, there, is, only, one, reactant, which, must, be, taken, into, account, when, calculating, the, reaction, rate, with, this, choice, we, tabulate, parameters, for, four, of, the, most, important, reactions, the, last, column, is, the, neutronicity, of, the, reaction, the, fraction, of, the, fusion, energy, released, as, neutrons, this, is, an, important, indicator, of, the, magnitude, of, the, problems, associated, with, neutrons, like, radiation, damage, biological, shielding, remote, handling, and, safety, for, the, first, two, reactions, it, is, calculated, as, e, fus, e, ch, e, fus, for, the, last, two, reactions, where, this, calculation, would, give, zero, the, values, quoted, are, rough, estimates, based, on, side, reactions, that, produce, neutrons, in, a, plasma, in, thermal, equilibrium, of, course, the, reactants, should, also, be, mixed, in, the, optimal, proportions, this, is, the, case, when, each, reactant, ion, plus, its, associated, electrons, accounts, for, half, the, pressure, assuming, that, the, total, pressure, is, fixed, this, means, that, particle, density, of, the, non, hydrogenic, ion, is, smaller, than, that, of, the, hydrogenic, ion, by, a, factor, 2, z, 1, therefore, the, rate, for, these, reactions, is, reduced, by, the, same, factor, on, top, of, any, differences, in, the, values, of, v, t, 2, on, the, other, hand, because, the, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, reaction, has, only, one, reactant, its, rate, is, twice, as, high, as, when, the, fuel, is, divided, between, two, different, hydrogenic, species, thus, creating, a, more, efficient, reaction, thus, there, is, a, penalty, of, 2, z, 1, for, non, hydrogenic, fuels, arising, from, the, fact, that, they, require, more, electrons, which, take, up, pressure, without, participating, in, the, fusion, reaction, it, is, usually, a, good, assumption, that, the, electron, temperature, will, be, nearly, equal, to, the, ion, temperature, some, authors, however, discuss, the, possibility, that, the, electrons, could, be, maintained, substantially, colder, than, the, ions, in, such, a, case, known, as, a, hot, ion, mode, the, penalty, would, not, apply, there, is, at, the, same, time, a, bonus, of, a, factor, 2, for, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, because, each, ion, can, react, with, any, of, the, other, ions, not, just, a, fraction, of, them, we, can, now, compare, these, reactions, in, the, following, table, the, maximum, value, of, v, t, 2, is, taken, from, a, previous, table, the, penalty, bonus, factor, is, that, related, to, a, non, hydrogenic, reactant, or, a, single, species, reaction, the, values, in, the, column, inverse, reactivity, are, found, by, dividing, 1, 24, 10, 24, by, the, product, of, the, second, and, third, columns, it, indicates, the, factor, by, which, the, other, reactions, occur, more, slowly, than, the, 2, 1, d, 3, 1, t, reaction, under, comparable, conditions, the, column, lawson, criterion, weights, these, results, with, e, ch, and, gives, an, indication, of, how, much, more, difficult, it, is, to, achieve, ignition, with, these, reactions, relative, to, the, difficulty, for, the, 2, 1, d, 3, 1, t, reaction, the, next, to, last, column, is, labeled, power, density, and, weights, the, practical, reactivity, by, e, fus, the, final, column, indicates, how, much, lower, the, fusion, power, density, of, the, other, reactions, is, compared, to, the, 2, 1, d, 3, 1, t, reaction, and, can, be, considered, a, measure, of, the, economic, potential, the, ions, undergoing, fusion, in, many, systems, will, essentially, never, occur, alone, but, will, be, mixed, with, electrons, that, in, aggregate, neutralize, the, ions, bulk, electrical, charge, and, form, a, plasma, the, electrons, will, generally, have, a, temperature, comparable, to, or, greater, than, that, of, the, ions, so, they, will, collide, with, the, ions, and, emit, x, ray, radiation, of, 10, 30, kev, energy, a, process, known, as, bremsstrahlung, the, huge, size, of, the, sun, and, stars, means, that, the, x, rays, produced, in, this, process, will, not, escape, and, will, deposit, their, energy, back, into, the, plasma, they, are, said, to, be, opaque, to, x, rays, but, any, terrestrial, fusion, reactor, will, be, optically, thin, for, x, rays, of, this, energy, range, x, rays, are, difficult, to, reflect, but, they, are, effectively, absorbed, and, converted, into, heat, in, less, than, mm, thickness, of, stainless, steel, which, is, part, of, a, reactor, s, shield, this, means, the, bremsstrahlung, process, is, carrying, energy, out, of, the, plasma, cooling, it, the, ratio, of, fusion, power, produced, to, x, ray, radiation, lost, to, walls, is, an, important, figure, of, merit, this, ratio, is, generally, maximized, at, a, much, higher, temperature, than, that, which, maximizes, the, power, density, see, the, previous, subsection, the, following, table, shows, estimates, of, the, optimum, temperature, and, the, power, ratio, at, that, temperature, for, several, reactions, the, actual, ratios, of, fusion, to, bremsstrahlung, power, will, likely, be, significantly, lower, for, several, reasons, for, one, the, calculation, assumes, that, the, energy, of, the, fusion, products, is, transmitted, completely, to, the, fuel, ions, which, then, lose, energy, to, the, electrons, by, collisions, which, in, turn, lose, energy, by, bremsstrahlung, however, because, the, fusion, products, move, much, faster, than, the, fuel, ions, they, will, give, up, a, significant, fraction, of, their, energy, directly, to, the, electrons, secondly, the, ions, in, the, plasma, are, assumed, to, be, purely, fuel, ions, in, practice, there, will, be, a, significant, proportion, of, impurity, ions, which, will, then, lower, the, ratio, in, particular, the, fusion, products, themselves, must, remain, in, the, plasma, until, they, have, given, up, their, energy, and, will, remain, for, some, time, after, that, in, any, proposed, confinement, scheme, finally, all, channels, of, energy, loss, other, than, bremsstrahlung, have, been, neglected, the, last, two, factors, are, related, on, theoretical, and, experimental, grounds, particle, and, energy, confinement, seem, to, be, closely, related, in, a, confinement, scheme, that, does, a, good, job, of, retaining, energy, fusion, products, will, build, up, if, the, fusion, products, are, efficiently, ejected, then, energy, confinement, will, be, poor, too, the, temperatures, maximizing, the, fusion, power, compared, to, the, bremsstrahlung, are, in, every, case, higher, than, the, temperature, that, maximizes, the, power, density, and, minimizes, the, required, value, of, the, fusion, triple, product, this, will, not, change, the, optimum, operating, point, for, 2, 1, d, 3, 1, t, very, much, because, the, bremsstrahlung, fraction, is, low, but, it, will, push, the, other, fuels, into, regimes, where, the, power, density, relative, to, 2, 1, d, 3, 1, t, is, even, lower, and, the, required, confinement, even, more, difficult, to, achieve, for, 2, 1, d, 2, 1, d, and, 2, 1, d, 3, 2, he, bremsstrahlung, losses, will, be, a, serious, possibly, prohibitive, problem, for, 3, 2, he, 3, 2, he, p, 6, 3, li, and, p, 11, 5, b, the, bremsstrahlung, losses, appear, to, make, a, fusion, reactor, using, these, fuels, with, a, quasineutral, isotropic, plasma, impossible, some, ways, out, of, this, dilemma, have, been, considered, but, rejected, this, limitation, does, not, apply, to, non, neutral, and, anisotropic, plasmas, however, these, have, their, own, challenges, to, contend, with, in, a, classical, picture, nuclei, can, be, understood, as, hard, spheres, that, repel, each, other, through, the, coulomb, force, but, fuse, once, the, two, spheres, come, close, enough, for, contact, estimating, the, radius, of, an, atomic, nuclei, as, about, one, femtometer, the, energy, needed, for, fusion, of, two, hydrogen, is, this, would, imply, that, for, the, core, of, the, sun, which, has, a, boltzmann, distribution, with, a, temperature, of, around, 1, 4, kev, the, probability, hydrogen, would, reach, the, threshold, is, 10, 290, displaystyle, 10, 290, that, is, fusion, would, never, occur, however, fusion, in, the, sun, does, occur, due, to, quantum, mechanics, the, probability, that, fusion, occurs, is, greatly, increased, compared, to, the, classical, picture, thanks, to, the, smearing, of, the, effective, radius, as, the, de, broglie, wavelength, as, well, as, quantum, tunneling, through, the, potential, barrier, to, determine, the, rate, of, fusion, reactions, the, value, of, most, interest, is, the, cross, section, which, describes, the, probability, that, particles, will, fuse, by, giving, a, characteristic, area, of, interaction, an, estimation, of, the, fusion, cross, sectional, area, is, often, broken, into, three, pieces, where, geometry, displaystyle, sigma, text, geometry, is, the, geometric, cross, section, t, is, the, barrier, transparency, and, r, is, the, reaction, characteristics, of, the, reaction, geometry, displaystyle, sigma, text, geometry, is, of, the, order, of, the, square, of, the, de,

t, e, g, displaystyle, t, approx, e, sqrt, epsilon, g, epsilon, where, g, z, 1, z, 2, 2, 2, m, r, c, 2, displaystyle, epsilon, g, pi, alpha, z, 1, z, 2, 2, times, 2m, r, c, 2, is, the, gamow, factor, and, comes, from, estimating, the, quantum, tunneling, probability, through, the, potential, barrier, r, contains, all, the, nuclear, physics, of, the, specific, reaction, and, takes, very, different, values, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, interaction, however, for, most, reactions, the, variation, of, r, displaystyle, r, epsilon, is, small, compared, to, the, variation, from, the, gamow, factor, and, so, is, approximated, by, a, function, called, the, astrophysical, s, factor, s, displaystyle, s, epsilon, which, is, weakly, varying, in, energy, putting, these, dependencies, together, one, approximation, for, the, fusion, cross, section, as, a, function, of, energy, takes, the, form, more, detailed, forms, of, the, cross, section, can, be, derived, through, nuclear, physics, based, models, and, r, matrix, theory, the, naval, research, lab, s, plasma, physics, formulary, gives, the, total, cross, section, in, barns, as, a, function, of, the, energy, in, kev, of, the, incident, particle, towards, a, target, ion, at, rest, fit, by, the, formula, bosch, hale, also, reports, a, r, matrix, calculated, cross, sections, fitting, observation, data, with, pad, rational, approximating, coefficients, with, energy, in, units, of, kev, and, cross, sections, in, units, of, millibarn, the, factor, has, the, form, where, bosch, hale, s, bosch, hale, exp, g, displaystyle,

maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, meaning, the, particles, have, a, range, of, energies, centered, around, the, plasma, temperature, the, sun, magnetically, confined, plasmas, and, inertial, confinement, fusion, systems, are, well, modeled, to, be, in, thermal, equilibrium, in, these, cases, the, value, of, interest, is, the, fusion, cross, section, averaged, across, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, the, naval, research, lab, s, plasma, physics, formulary, tabulates, maxwell, averaged, fusion, cross, sections, reactivities, in, c, m, 3, s, displaystyle, mathrm, cm, 3, s,
