legend, the, alkali, metals, consist, of, the, chemical, elements, lithium, li, sodium, na, potassium, k, rubidium, rb, caesium, cs, and, francium, fr, together, with, hydrogen, they, constitute, group, 1, which, lies, in, the, s, block, of, the, periodic, table, all, alkali, metals, have, their, outermost, electron, in, an, s, orbital, this, shared, electron, configuration, results, in, their, having, very, similar, characteristic, properties, indeed, the, alkali, metals, provide, the, best, example, of, group, trends, in, properties, in, the, periodic, table, with, elements, exhibiting, well, characterised, homologous, behaviour, this, family, of, elements, is, also, known, as, the, lithium, family, after, its, leading, element, the, alkali, metals, are, all, shiny, soft, highly, reactive, metals, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, and, readily, lose, their, outermost, electron, to, form, cations, with, charge, 1, they, can, all, be, cut, easily, with, a, knife, due, to, their, softness, exposing, a, shiny, surface, that, tarnishes, rapidly, in, air, due, to, oxidation, by, atmospheric, moisture, and, oxygen, and, in, the, case, of, lithium, nitrogen, because, of, their, high, reactivity, they, must, be, stored, under, oil, to, prevent, reaction, with, air, and, are, found, naturally, only, in, salts, and, never, as, the, free, elements, caesium, the, fifth, alkali, metal, is, the, most, reactive, of, all, the, metals, all, the, alkali, metals, react, with, water, with, the, heavier, alkali, metals, reacting, more, vigorously, than, the, lighter, ones, all, of, the, discovered, alkali, metals, occur, in, nature, as, their, compounds, in, order, of, abundance, sodium, is, the, most, abundant, followed, by, potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and, finally, francium, which, is, very, rare, due, to, its, extremely, high, radioactivity, francium, occurs, only, in, minute, traces, in, nature, as, an, intermediate, step, in, some, obscure, side, branches, of, the, natural, decay, chains, experiments, have, been, conducted, to, attempt, the, synthesis, of, element, 119, which, is, likely, to, be, the, next, member, of, the, group, none, were, successful, however, ununennium, may, not, be, an, alkali, metal, due, to, relativistic, effects, which, are, predicted, to, have, a, large, influence, on, the, chemical, properties, of, superheavy, elements, even, if, it, does, turn, out, to, be, an, alkali, metal, it, is, predicted, to, have, some, differences, in, physical, and, chemical, properties, from, its, lighter, homologues, most, alkali, metals, have, many, different, applications, one, of, the, best, known, applications, of, the, pure, elements, is, the, use, of, rubidium, and, caesium, in, atomic, clocks, of, which, caesium, atomic, clocks, form, the, basis, of, the, second, a, common, application, of, the, compounds, of, sodium, is, the, sodium, vapour, lamp, which, emits, light, very, efficiently, table, salt, or, sodium, chloride, has, been, used, since, antiquity, lithium, finds, use, as, a, psychiatric, medication, and, as, an, anode, in, lithium, batteries, sodium, potassium, and, possibly, lithium, are, essential, elements, having, major, biological, roles, as, electrolytes, and, although, the, other, alkali, metals, are, not, essential, they, also, have, various, effects, on, the, body, both, beneficial, and, harmful, sodium, compounds, have, been, known, since, ancient, times, salt, sodium, chloride, has, been, an, important, commodity, in, human, activities, while, potash, has, been, used, since, ancient, times, it, was, not, understood, for, most, of, its, history, to, be, a, fundamentally, different, substance, from, sodium, mineral, salts, georg, ernst, stahl, obtained, experimental, evidence, which, led, him, to, suggest, the, fundamental, difference, of, sodium, and, potassium, salts, in, 1702, and, henri, louis, duhamel, du, monceau, was, able, to, prove, this, difference, in, 1736, the, exact, chemical, composition, of, potassium, and, sodium, compounds, and, the, status, as, chemical, element, of, potassium, and, sodium, was, not, known, then, and, thus, antoine, lavoisier, did, not, include, either, alkali, in, his, list, of, chemical, elements, in, 1789, pure, potassium, was, first, isolated, in, 1807, in, england, by, humphry, davy, who, derived, it, from, caustic, potash, koh, potassium, hydroxide, by, the, use, of, electrolysis, of, the, molten, salt, with, the, newly, invented, voltaic, pile, previous, attempts, at, electrolysis, of, the, aqueous, salt, were, unsuccessful, due, to, potassium, s, extreme, reactivity, 68, potassium, was, the, first, metal, that, was, isolated, by, electrolysis, later, that, same, year, davy, reported, extraction, of, sodium, from, the, similar, substance, caustic, soda, naoh, lye, by, a, similar, technique, demonstrating, the, elements, and, thus, the, salts, to, be, different, petalite, li, al, si, 4, o, 10, was, discovered, in, 1800, by, the, brazilian, chemist, jos, bonif, cio, de, andrada, in, a, mine, on, the, island, of, ut, sweden, however, it, was, not, until, 1817, that, johan, august, arfwedson, then, working, in, the, laboratory, of, the, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, detected, the, presence, of, a, new, element, while, analysing, petalite, ore, this, new, element, was, noted, by, him, to, form, compounds, similar, to, those, of, sodium, and, potassium, though, its, carbonate, and, hydroxide, were, less, soluble, in, water, and, more, alkaline, than, the, other, alkali, metals, berzelius, gave, the, unknown, material, the, name, lithion, lithina, from, the, greek, word, o, transliterated, as, lithos, meaning, stone, to, reflect, its, discovery, in, a, solid, mineral, as, opposed, to, potassium, which, had, been, discovered, in, plant, ashes, and, sodium, which, was, known, partly, for, its, high, abundance, in, animal, blood, he, named, the, metal, inside, the, material, lithium, lithium, sodium, and, potassium, were, part, of, the, discovery, of, periodicity, as, they, are, among, a, series, of, triads, of, elements, in, the, same, group, that, were, noted, by, johann, wolfgang, d, bereiner, in, 1850, as, having, similar, properties, rubidium, and, caesium, were, the, first, elements, to, be, discovered, using, the, spectroscope, invented, in, 1859, by, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, the, next, year, they, discovered, caesium, in, the, mineral, water, from, bad, d, rkheim, germany, their, discovery, of, rubidium, came, the, following, year, in, heidelberg, germany, finding, it, in, the, mineral, lepidolite, the, names, of, rubidium, and, caesium, come, from, the, most, prominent, lines, in, their, emission, spectra, a, bright, red, line, for, rubidium, from, the, latin, word, rubidus, meaning, dark, red, or, bright, red, and, a, sky, blue, line, for, caesium, derived, from, the, latin, word, caesius, meaning, sky, blue, around, 1865, john, newlands, produced, a, series, of, papers, where, he, listed, the, elements, in, order, of, increasing, atomic, weight, and, similar, physical, and, chemical, properties, that, recurred, at, intervals, of, eight, he, likened, such, periodicity, to, the, octaves, of, music, where, notes, an, octave, apart, have, similar, musical, functions, his, version, put, all, the, alkali, metals, then, known, lithium, to, caesium, as, well, as, copper, silver, and, thallium, which, show, the, 1, oxidation, state, characteristic, of, the, alkali, metals, together, into, a, group, his, table, placed, hydrogen, with, the, halogens, after, 1869, dmitri, mendeleev, proposed, his, periodic, table, placing, lithium, at, the, top, of, a, group, with, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and, thallium, two, years, later, mendeleev, revised, his, table, placing, hydrogen, in, group, 1, above, lithium, and, also, moving, thallium, to, the, boron, group, in, this, 1871, version, copper, silver, and, gold, were, placed, twice, once, as, part, of, group, ib, and, once, as, part, of, a, group, viii, encompassing, today, s, groups, 8, to, 11, after, the, introduction, of, the, 18, column, table, the, group, ib, elements, were, moved, to, their, current, position, in, the, d, block, while, alkali, metals, were, left, in, group, ia, later, the, group, s, name, was, changed, to, group, 1, in, 1988, the, trivial, name, alkali, metals, comes, from, the, fact, that, the, hydroxides, of, the, group, 1, elements, are, all, strong, alkalis, when, dissolved, in, water, there, were, at, least, four, erroneous, and, incomplete, discoveries, before, marguerite, perey, of, the, curie, institute, in, paris, france, discovered, francium, in, 1939, by, purifying, a, sample, of, actinium, 227, which, had, been, reported, to, have, a, decay, energy, of, 220, kev, however, perey, noticed, decay, particles, with, an, energy, level, below, 80, kev, perey, thought, this, decay, activity, might, have, been, caused, by, a, previously, unidentified, decay, product, one, that, was, separated, during, purification, but, emerged, again, out, of, the, pure, actinium, 227, various, tests, eliminated, the, possibility, of, the, unknown, element, being, thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or, thallium, the, new, product, exhibited, chemical, properties, of, an, alkali, metal, such, as, coprecipitating, with, caesium, salts, which, led, perey, to, believe, that, it, was, element, 87, caused, by, the, alpha, decay, of, actinium, 227, perey, then, attempted, to, determine, the, proportion, of, beta, decay, to, alpha, decay, in, actinium, 227, her, first, test, put, the, alpha, branching, at, 0, 6, a, figure, that, she, later, revised, to, 1, the, next, element, below, francium, eka, francium, in, the, periodic, table, would, be, ununennium, uue, element, 119, 1729, 1730, the, synthesis, of, ununennium, was, first, attempted, in, 1985, by, bombarding, a, target, of, einsteinium, 254, with, calcium, 48, ions, at, the, superhilac, accelerator, at, the, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, in, berkeley, california, no, atoms, were, identified, leading, to, a, limiting, yield, of, 300, nb, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, this, reaction, will, be, able, to, create, any, atoms, of, ununennium, in, the, near, future, given, the, extremely, difficult, task, of, making, sufficient, amounts, of, einsteinium, 254, which, is, favoured, for, production, of, ultraheavy, elements, because, of, its, large, mass, relatively, long, half, life, of, 270, days, and, availability, in, significant, amounts, of, several, micrograms, to, make, a, large, enough, target, to, increase, the, sensitivity, of, the, experiment, to, the, required, level, einsteinium, has, not, been, found, in, nature, and, has, only, been, produced, in, laboratories, and, in, quantities, smaller, than, those, needed, for, effective, synthesis, of, superheavy, elements, however, given, that, ununennium, is, only, the, first, period, 8, element, on, the, extended, periodic, table, it, may, well, be, discovered, in, the, near, future, through, other, reactions, and, indeed, an, attempt, to, synthesise, it, is, currently, ongoing, in, japan, currently, none, of, the, period, 8, elements, has, been, discovered, yet, and, it, is, also, possible, due, to, drip, instabilities, that, only, the, lower, period, 8, elements, up, to, around, element, 128, are, physically, possible, no, attempts, at, synthesis, have, been, made, for, any, heavier, alkali, metals, due, to, their, extremely, high, atomic, number, they, would, require, new, more, powerful, methods, and, technology, to, make, 1737, 1739, the, oddo, harkins, rule, holds, that, elements, with, even, atomic, numbers, are, more, common, that, those, with, odd, atomic, numbers, with, the, exception, of, hydrogen, this, rule, argues, that, elements, with, odd, atomic, numbers, have, one, unpaired, proton, and, are, more, likely, to, capture, another, thus, increasing, their, atomic, number, in, elements, with, even, atomic, numbers, protons, are, paired, with, each, member, of, the, pair, offsetting, the, spin, of, the, other, enhancing, stability, all, the, alkali, metals, have, odd, atomic, numbers, and, they, are, not, as, common, as, the, elements, with, even, atomic, numbers, adjacent, to, them, the, noble, gases, and, the, alkaline, earth, metals, in, the, solar, system, the, heavier, alkali, metals, are, also, less, abundant, than, the, lighter, ones, as, the, alkali, metals, from, rubidium, onward, can, only, be, synthesised, in, supernovae, and, not, in, stellar, nucleosynthesis, lithium, is, also, much, less, abundant, than, sodium, and, potassium, as, it, is, poorly, synthesised, in, both, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, and, in, stars, the, big, bang, could, only, produce, trace, quantities, of, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, due, to, the, absence, of, a, stable, nucleus, with, 5, or, 8, nucleons, and, stellar, nucleosynthesis, could, only, pass, this, bottleneck, by, the, triple, alpha, process, fusing, three, helium, nuclei, to, form, carbon, and, skipping, over, those, three, elements, the, earth, formed, from, the, same, cloud, of, matter, that, formed, the, sun, but, the, planets, acquired, different, compositions, during, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, solar, system, in, turn, the, natural, history, of, the, earth, caused, parts, of, this, planet, to, have, differing, concentrations, of, the, elements, the, mass, of, the, earth, is, approximately, 5, 98, 10, 24, kg, it, is, composed, mostly, of, iron, 32, 1, oxygen, 30, 1, silicon, 15, 1, magnesium, 13, 9, sulfur, 2, 9, nickel, 1, 8, calcium, 1, 5, and, aluminium, 1, 4, with, the, remaining, 1, 2, consisting, of, trace, amounts, of, other, elements, due, to, planetary, differentiation, the, core, region, is, believed, to, be, primarily, composed, of, iron, 88, 8, with, smaller, amounts, of, nickel, 5, 8, sulfur, 4, 5, and, less, than, 1, trace, elements, the, alkali, metals, due, to, their, high, reactivity, do, not, occur, naturally, in, pure, form, in, nature, they, are, lithophiles, and, therefore, remain, close, to, the, earth, s, surface, because, they, combine, readily, with, oxygen, and, so, associate, strongly, with, silica, forming, relatively, low, density, minerals, that, do, not, sink, down, into, the, earth, s, core, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, are, also, incompatible, elements, due, to, their, large, ionic, radii, sodium, and, potassium, are, very, abundant, on, earth, both, being, among, the, ten, most, common, elements, in, earth, s, crust, sodium, makes, up, approximately, 2, 6, of, the, earth, s, crust, measured, by, weight, making, it, the, sixth, most, abundant, element, overall, and, the, most, abundant, alkali, metal, potassium, makes, up, approximately, 1, 5, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, is, the, seventh, most, abundant, element, sodium, is, found, in, many, different, minerals, of, which, the, most, common, is, ordinary, salt, sodium, chloride, which, occurs, in, vast, quantities, dissolved, in, seawater, other, solid, deposits, include, halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and, zeolite, many, of, these, solid, deposits, occur, as, a, result, of, ancient, seas, evaporating, which, still, occurs, now, in, places, such, as, utah, s, great, salt, lake, and, the, dead, sea, 69, despite, their, near, equal, abundance, in, earth, s, crust, sodium, is, far, more, common, than, potassium, in, the, ocean, both, because, potassium, s, larger, size, makes, its, salts, less, soluble, and, because, potassium, is, bound, by, silicates, in, soil, and, what, potassium, leaches, is, absorbed, far, more, readily, by, plant, life, than, sodium, 69, despite, its, chemical, similarity, lithium, typically, does, not, occur, together, with, sodium, or, potassium, due, to, its, smaller, size, 69, due, to, its, relatively, low, reactivity, it, can, be, found, in, seawater, in, large, amounts, it, is, estimated, that, lithium, concentration, in, seawater, is, approximately, 0, 14, to, 0, 25, parts, per, million, ppm, or, 25, micromolar, its, diagonal, relationship, with, magnesium, often, allows, it, to, replace, magnesium, in, ferromagnesium, minerals, where, its, crustal, concentration, is, about, 18, ppm, comparable, to, that, of, gallium, and, niobium, commercially, the, most, important, lithium, mineral, is, spodumene, which, occurs, in, large, deposits, worldwide, 69, rubidium, is, approximately, as, abundant, as, zinc, and, more, abundant, than, copper, it, occurs, naturally, in, the, minerals, leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and, lepidolite, although, none, of, these, contain, only, rubidium, and, no, other, alkali, metals, 70, caesium, is, more, abundant, than, some, commonly, known, elements, such, as, antimony, cadmium, tin, and, tungsten, but, is, much, less, abundant, than, rubidium, francium, 223, the, only, naturally, occurring, isotope, of, francium, is, the, product, of, the, alpha, decay, of, actinium, 227, and, can, be, found, in, trace, amounts, in, uranium, minerals, in, a, given, sample, of, uranium, there, is, estimated, to, be, only, one, francium, atom, for, every, 10, 18, uranium, atoms, it, has, been, calculated, that, there, are, at, most, 30, grams, of, francium, in, the, earth, s, crust, at, any, time, due, to, its, extremely, short, half, life, of, 22, minutes, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, the, alkali, metals, can, be, readily, explained, by, their, having, an, ns, 1, valence, electron, configuration, which, results, in, weak, metallic, bonding, hence, all, the, alkali, metals, are, soft, and, have, low, densities, melting, and, boiling, points, as, well, as, heats, of, sublimation, vaporisation, and, dissociation, 74, they, all, crystallise, in, the, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, 73, and, have, distinctive, flame, colours, because, their, outer, s, electron, is, very, easily, excited, 75, indeed, these, flame, test, colours, are, the, most, common, way, of, identifying, them, since, all, their, salts, with, common, ions, are, soluble, 75, the, ns, 1, configuration, also, results, in, the, alkali, metals, having, very, large, atomic, and, ionic, radii, as, well, as, very, high, thermal, and, electrical, conductivity, 75, their, chemistry, is, dominated, by, the, loss, of, their, lone, valence, electron, in, the, outermost, s, orbital, to, form, the, 1, oxidation, state, due, to, the, ease, of, ionising, this, electron, and, the, very, high, second, ionisation, energy, 76, most, of, the, chemistry, has, been, observed, only, for, the, first, five, members, of, the, group, the, chemistry, of, francium, is, not, well, established, due, to, its, extreme, radioactivity, thus, the, presentation, of, its, properties, here, is, limited, what, little, is, known, about, francium, shows, that, it, is, very, close, in, behaviour, to, caesium, as, expected, the, physical, properties, of, francium, are, even, sketchier, because, the, bulk, element, has, never, been, observed, hence, any, data, that, may, be, found, in, the, literature, are, certainly, speculative, extrapolations, the, alkali, metals, are, more, similar, to, each, other, than, the, elements, in, any, other, group, are, to, each, other, indeed, the, similarity, is, so, great, that, it, is, quite, difficult, to, separate, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, due, to, their, similar, ionic, radii, lithium, and, sodium, are, more, distinct, for, instance, when, moving, down, the, table, all, known, alkali, metals, show, increasing, atomic, radius, decreasing, electronegativity, increasing, reactivity, and, decreasing, melting, and, boiling, points, as, well, as, heats, of, fusion, and, vaporisation, 75, in, general, their, densities, increase, when, moving, down, the, table, with, the, exception, that, potassium, is, less, dense, than, sodium, one, of, the, very, few, properties, of, the, alkali, metals, that, does, not, display, a, very, smooth, trend, is, their, reduction, potentials, lithium, s, value, is, anomalous, being, more, negative, than, the, others, 75, this, is, because, the, li, ion, has, a, very, high, hydration, energy, in, the, gas, phase, though, the, lithium, ion, disrupts, the, structure, of, water, significantly, causing, a, higher, change, in, entropy, this, high, hydration, energy, is, enough, to, make, the, reduction, potentials, indicate, it, as, being, the, most, electropositive, alkali, metal, despite, the, difficulty, of, ionising, it, in, the, gas, phase, 75, the, stable, alkali, metals, are, all, silver, coloured, metals, except, for, caesium, which, has, a, pale, golden, tint, it, is, one, of, only, three, metals, that, are, clearly, coloured, the, other, two, being, copper, and, gold, 74, additionally, the, heavy, alkaline, earth, metals, calcium, strontium, and, barium, as, well, as, the, divalent, lanthanides, europium, and, ytterbium, are, pale, yellow, though, the, colour, is, much, less, prominent, than, it, is, for, caesium, 74, their, lustre, tarnishes, rapidly, in, air, due, to, oxidation, all, the, alkali, metals, are, highly, reactive, and, are, never, found, in, elemental, forms, in, nature, because, of, this, they, are, usually, stored, in, mineral, oil, or, kerosene, paraffin, oil, they, react, aggressively, with, the, halogens, to, form, the, alkali, metal, halides, which, are, white, ionic, crystalline, compounds, that, are, all, soluble, in, water, except, lithium, fluoride, lif, the, alkali, metals, also, react, with, water, to, form, strongly, alkaline, hydroxides, and, thus, should, be, handled, with, great, care, the, heavier, alkali, metals, react, more, vigorously, than, the, lighter, ones, for, example, when, dropped, into, water, caesium, produces, a, larger, explosion, than, potassium, if, the, same, number, of, moles, of, each, metal, is, used, the, alkali, metals, have, the, lowest, first, ionisation, energies, in, their, respective, periods, of, the, periodic, table, because, of, their, low, effective, nuclear, charge, and, the, ability, to, attain, a, noble, gas, configuration, by, losing, just, one, electron, not, only, do, the, alkali, metals, react, with, water, but, also, with, proton, donors, like, alcohols, and, phenols, gaseous, ammonia, and, alkynes, the, last, demonstrating, the, phenomenal, degree, of, their, reactivity, their, great, power, as, reducing, agents, makes, them, very, useful, in, liberating, other, metals, from, their, oxides, or, halides, 76, the, second, ionisation, energy, of, all, of, the, alkali, metals, is, very, high, as, it, is, in, a, full, shell, that, is, also, closer, to, the, nucleus, thus, they, almost, always, lose, a, single, electron, forming, cations, 28, the, alkalides, are, an, exception, they, are, unstable, compounds, which, contain, alkali, metals, in, a, 1, oxidation, state, which, is, very, unusual, as, before, the, discovery, of, the, alkalides, the, alkali, metals, were, not, expected, to, be, able, to, form, anions, and, were, thought, to, be, able, to, appear, in, salts, only, as, cations, the, alkalide, anions, have, filled, s, subshells, which, gives, them, enough, stability, to, exist, all, the, stable, alkali, metals, except, lithium, are, known, to, be, able, to, form, alkalides, and, the, alkalides, have, much, theoretical, interest, due, to, their, unusual, stoichiometry, and, low, ionisation, potentials, alkalides, are, chemically, similar, to, the, electrides, which, are, salts, with, trapped, electrons, acting, as, anions, a, particularly, striking, example, of, an, alkalide, is, inverse, sodium, hydride, h, na, both, ions, being, complexed, as, opposed, to, the, usual, sodium, hydride, na, h, it, is, unstable, in, isolation, due, to, its, high, energy, resulting, from, the, displacement, of, two, electrons, from, hydrogen, to, sodium, although, several, derivatives, are, predicted, to, be, metastable, or, stable, in, aqueous, solution, the, alkali, metal, ions, form, aqua, ions, of, the, formula, where, n, is, the, solvation, number, their, coordination, numbers, and, shapes, agree, well, with, those, expected, from, their, ionic, radii, in, aqueous, solution, the, water, molecules, directly, attached, to, the, metal, ion, are, said, to, belong, to, the, first, coordination, sphere, also, known, as, the, first, or, primary, solvation, shell, the, bond, between, a, water, molecule, and, the, metal, ion, is, a, dative, covalent, bond, with, the, oxygen, atom, donating, both, electrons, to, the, bond, each, coordinated, water, molecule, may, be, attached, by, hydrogen, bonds, to, other, water, molecules, the, latter, are, said, to, reside, in, the, second, coordination, sphere, however, for, the, alkali, metal, cations, the, second, coordination, sphere, is, not, well, defined, as, the, 1, charge, on, the, cation, is, not, high, enough, to, polarise, the, water, molecules, in, the, primary, solvation, shell, enough, for, them, to, form, strong, hydrogen, bonds, with, those, in, the, second, coordination, sphere, producing, a, more, stable, entity, 25, the, solvation, number, for, li, has, been, experimentally, determined, to, be, 4, forming, the, tetrahedral, while, solvation, numbers, of, 3, to, 6, have, been, found, for, lithium, aqua, ions, solvation, numbers, less, than, 4, may, be, the, result, of, the, formation, of, contact, ion, pairs, and, the, higher, solvation, numbers, may, be, interpreted, in, terms, of, water, molecules, that, approach, through, a, face, of, the, tetrahedron, though, molecular, dynamic, simulations, may, indicate, the, existence, of, an, octahedral, hexaaqua, ion, there, are, also, probably, six, water, molecules, in, the, primary, solvation, sphere, of, the, sodium, ion, forming, the, octahedral, ion, 126, 127, while, it, was, previously, thought, that, the, heavier, alkali, metals, also, formed, octahedral, hexaaqua, ions, it, has, since, been, found, that, potassium, and, rubidium, probably, form, the, and, ions, which, have, the, square, antiprismatic, structure, and, that, caesium, forms, the, 12, coordinate, ion, the, chemistry, of, lithium, shows, several, differences, from, that, of, the, rest, of, the, group, as, the, small, li, cation, polarises, anions, and, gives, its, compounds, a, more, covalent, character, lithium, and, magnesium, have, a, diagonal, relationship, due, to, their, similar, atomic, radii, so, that, they, show, some, similarities, for, example, lithium, forms, a, stable, nitride, a, property, common, among, all, the, alkaline, earth, metals, magnesium, s, group, but, unique, among, the, alkali, metals, in, addition, among, their, respective, groups, only, lithium, and, magnesium, form, organometallic, compounds, with, significant, covalent, character, e, g, li, me, and, mgme, 2, lithium, fluoride, is, the, only, alkali, metal, halide, that, is, poorly, soluble, in, water, and, lithium, hydroxide, is, the, only, alkali, metal, hydroxide, that, is, not, deliquescent, conversely, lithium, perchlorate, and, other, lithium, salts, with, large, anions, that, cannot, be, polarised, are, much, more, stable, than, the, analogous, compounds, of, the, other, alkali, metals, probably, because, li, has, a, high, solvation, energy, 76, this, effect, also, means, that, most, simple, lithium, salts, are, commonly, encountered, in, hydrated, form, because, the, anhydrous, forms, are, extremely, hygroscopic, this, allows, salts, like, lithium, chloride, and, lithium, bromide, to, be, used, in, dehumidifiers, and, air, conditioners, 76, francium, is, also, predicted, to, show, some, differences, due, to, its, high, atomic, weight, causing, its, electrons, to, travel, at, considerable, fractions, of, the, speed, of, light, and, thus, making, relativistic, effects, more, prominent, in, contrast, to, the, trend, of, decreasing, electronegativities, and, ionisation, energies, of, the, alkali, metals, francium, s, electronegativity, and, ionisation, energy, are, predicted, to, be, higher, than, caesium, s, due, to, the, relativistic, stabilisation, of, the, 7s, electrons, also, its, atomic, radius, is, expected, to, be, abnormally, low, thus, contrary, to, expectation, caesium, is, the, most, reactive, of, the, alkali, metals, not, francium, 1729, all, known, physical, properties, of, francium, also, deviate, from, the, clear, trends, going, from, lithium, to, caesium, such, as, the, first, ionisation, energy, electron, affinity, and, anion, polarisability, though, due, to, the, paucity, of, known, data, about, francium, many, sources, give, extrapolated, values, ignoring, that, relativistic, effects, make, the, trend, from, lithium, to, caesium, become, inapplicable, at, francium, some, of, the, few, properties, of, francium, that, have, been, predicted, taking, relativity, into, account, are, the, electron, affinity, 47, 2, kj, mol, and, the, enthalpy, of, dissociation, of, the, fr, 2, molecule, 42, 1, kj, mol, the, csfr, molecule, is, polarised, as, cs, fr, showing, that, the, 7s, subshell, of, francium, is, much, more, strongly, affected, by, relativistic, effects, than, the, 6s, subshell, of, caesium, additionally, francium, superoxide, fro, 2, is, expected, to, have, significant, covalent, character, unlike, the, other, alkali, metal, superoxides, because, of, bonding, contributions, from, the, 6p, electrons, of, francium, all, the, alkali, metals, have, odd, atomic, numbers, hence, their, isotopes, must, be, either, odd, odd, both, proton, and, neutron, number, are, odd, or, odd, even, proton, number, is, odd, but, neutron, number, is, even, odd, odd, nuclei, have, even, mass, numbers, whereas, odd, even, nuclei, have, odd, mass, numbers, odd, odd, primordial, nuclides, are, rare, because, most, odd, odd, nuclei, are, highly, unstable, with, respect, to, beta, decay, because, the, decay, products, are, even, even, and, are, therefore, more, strongly, bound, due, to, nuclear, pairing, effects, due, to, the, great, rarity, of, odd, odd, nuclei, almost, all, the, primordial, isotopes, of, the, alkali, metals, are, odd, even, the, exceptions, being, the, light, stable, isotope, lithium, 6, and, the, long, lived, radioisotope, potassium, 40, for, a, given, odd, mass, number, there, can, be, only, a, single, beta, stable, nuclide, since, there, is, not, a, difference, in, binding, energy, between, even, odd, and, odd, even, comparable, to, that, between, even, even, and, odd, odd, leaving, other, nuclides, of, the, same, mass, number, isobars, free, to, beta, decay, toward, the, lowest, mass, nuclide, an, effect, of, the, instability, of, an, odd, number, of, either, type, of, nucleons, is, that, odd, numbered, elements, such, as, the, alkali, metals, tend, to, have, fewer, stable, isotopes, than, even, numbered, elements, of, the, 26, monoisotopic, elements, that, have, only, a, single, stable, isotope, all, but, one, have, an, odd, atomic, number, and, all, but, one, also, have, an, even, number, of, neutrons, beryllium, is, the, single, exception, to, both, rules, due, to, its, low, atomic, number, all, of, the, alkali, metals, except, lithium, and, caesium, have, at, least, one, naturally, occurring, radioisotope, sodium, 22, and, sodium, 24, are, trace, radioisotopes, produced, cosmogenically, potassium, 40, and, rubidium, 87, have, very, long, half, lives, and, thus, occur, naturally, and, all, isotopes, of, francium, are, radioactive, caesium, was, also, thought, to, be, radioactive, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, it, has, no, naturally, occurring, radioisotopes, francium, had, not, been, discovered, yet, at, that, time, the, natural, long, lived, radioisotope, of, potassium, potassium, 40, makes, up, about, 0, 012, of, natural, potassium, and, thus, natural, potassium, is, weakly, radioactive, this, natural, radioactivity, became, a, basis, for, a, mistaken, claim, of, the, discovery, for, element, 87, the, next, alkali, metal, after, caesium, in, 1925, natural, rubidium, is, similarly, slightly, radioactive, with, 27, 83, being, the, long, lived, radioisotope, rubidium, 87, 74, caesium, 137, with, a, half, life, of, 30, 17, years, is, one, of, the, two, principal, medium, lived, fission, products, along, with, strontium, 90, which, are, responsible, for, most, of, the, radioactivity, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, after, several, years, of, cooling, up, to, several, hundred, years, after, use, it, constitutes, most, of, the, radioactivity, still, left, from, the, chernobyl, accident, caesium, 137, undergoes, high, energy, beta, decay, and, eventually, becomes, stable, barium, 137, it, is, a, strong, emitter, of, gamma, radiation, caesium, 137, has, a, very, low, rate, of, neutron, capture, and, cannot, be, feasibly, disposed, of, in, this, way, but, must, be, allowed, to, decay, caesium, 137, has, been, used, as, a, tracer, in, hydrologic, studies, analogous, to, the, use, of, tritium, small, amounts, of, caesium, 134, and, caesium, 137, were, released, into, the, environment, during, nearly, all, nuclear, weapon, tests, and, some, nuclear, accidents, most, notably, the, goi, nia, accident, and, the, chernobyl, disaster, as, of, 2005, caesium, 137, is, the, principal, source, of, radiation, in, the, zone, of, alienation, around, the, chernobyl, nuclear, power, plant, its, chemical, properties, as, one, of, the, alkali, metals, make, it, one, of, the, most, problematic, of, the, short, to, medium, lifetime, fission, products, because, it, easily, moves, and, spreads, in, nature, due, to, the, high, water, solubility, of, its, salts, and, is, taken, up, by, the, body, which, mistakes, it, for, its, essential, congeners, sodium, and, potassium, 114, the, alkali, metals, are, more, similar, to, each, other, than, the, elements, in, any, other, group, are, to, each, other, for, instance, when, moving, down, the, table, all, known, alkali, metals, show, increasing, atomic, radius, decreasing, electronegativity, increasing, reactivity, and, decreasing, melting, and, boiling, points, as, well, as, heats, of, fusion, and, vaporisation, 75, in, general, their, densities, increase, when, moving, down, the, table, with, the, exception, that, potassium, is, less, dense, than, sodium, the, atomic, radii, of, the, alkali, metals, increase, going, down, the, group, because, of, the, shielding, effect, when, an, atom, has, more, than, one, electron, shell, each, electron, feels, electric, repulsion, from, the, other, electrons, as, well, as, electric, attraction, from, the, nucleus, in, the, alkali, metals, the, outermost, electron, only, feels, a, net, charge, of, 1, as, some, of, the, nuclear, charge, which, is, equal, to, the, atomic, number, is, cancelled, by, the, inner, electrons, the, number, of, inner, electrons, of, an, alkali, metal, is, always, one, less, than, the, nuclear, charge, therefore, the, only, factor, which, affects, the, atomic, radius, of, the, alkali, metals, is, the, number, of, electron, shells, since, this, number, increases, down, the, group, the, atomic, radius, must, also, increase, down, the, group, the, ionic, radii, of, the, alkali, metals, are, much, smaller, than, their, atomic, radii, this, is, because, the, outermost, electron, of, the, alkali, metals, is, in, a, different, electron, shell, than, the, inner, electrons, and, thus, when, it, is, removed, the, resulting, atom, has, one, fewer, electron, shell, and, is, smaller, additionally, the, effective, nuclear, charge, has, increased, and, thus, the, electrons, are, attracted, more, strongly, towards, the, nucleus, and, the, ionic, radius, decreases, the, first, ionisation, energy, of, an, element, or, molecule, is, the, energy, required, to, move, the, most, loosely, held, electron, from, one, mole, of, gaseous, atoms, of, the, element, or, molecules, to, form, one, mole, of, gaseous, ions, with, electric, charge, 1, the, factors, affecting, the, first, ionisation, energy, are, the, nuclear, charge, the, amount, of, shielding, by, the, inner, electrons, and, the, distance, from, the, most, loosely, held, electron, from, the, nucleus, which, is, always, an, outer, electron, in, main, group, elements, the, first, two, factors, change, the, effective, nuclear, charge, the, most, loosely, held, electron, feels, since, the, outermost, electron, of, alkali, metals, always, feels, the, same, effective, nuclear, charge, 1, the, only, factor, which, affects, the, first, ionisation, energy, is, the, distance, from, the, outermost, electron, to, the, nucleus, since, this, distance, increases, down, the, group, the, outermost, electron, feels, less, attraction, from, the, nucleus, and, thus, the, first, ionisation, energy, decreases, this, trend, is, broken, in, francium, due, to, the, relativistic, stabilisation, and, contraction, of, the, 7s, orbital, bringing, francium, s, valence, electron, closer, to, the, nucleus, than, would, be, expected, from, non, relativistic, calculations, this, makes, francium, s, outermost, electron, feel, more, attraction, from, the, nucleus, increasing, its, first, ionisation, energy, slightly, beyond, that, of, caesium, 1729, the, second, ionisation, energy, of, the, alkali, metals, is, much, higher, than, the, first, as, the, second, most, loosely, held, electron, is, part, of, a, fully, filled, electron, shell, and, is, thus, difficult, to, remove, the, reactivities, of, the, alkali, metals, increase, going, down, the, group, this, is, the, result, of, a, combination, of, two, factors, the, first, ionisation, energies, and, atomisation, energies, of, the, alkali, metals, because, the, first, ionisation, energy, of, the, alkali, metals, decreases, down, the, group, it, is, easier, for, the, outermost, electron, to, be, removed, from, the, atom, and, participate, in, chemical, reactions, thus, increasing, reactivity, down, the, group, the, atomisation, energy, measures, the, strength, of, the, metallic, bond, of, an, element, which, falls, down, the, group, as, the, atoms, increase, in, radius, and, thus, the, metallic, bond, must, increase, in, length, making, the, delocalised, electrons, further, away, from, the, attraction, of, the, nuclei, of, the, heavier, alkali, metals, adding, the, atomisation, and, first, ionisation, energies, gives, a, quantity, closely, related, to, but, not, equal, to, the, activation, energy, of, the, reaction, of, an, alkali, metal, with, another, substance, this, quantity, decreases, going, down, the, group, and, so, does, the, activation, energy, thus, chemical, reactions, can, occur, faster, and, the, reactivity, increases, down, the, group, electronegativity, is, a, chemical, property, that, describes, the, tendency, of, an, atom, or, a, functional, group, to, attract, electrons, or, electron, density, towards, itself, if, the, bond, between, sodium, and, chlorine, in, sodium, chloride, were, covalent, the, pair, of, shared, electrons, would, be, attracted, to, the, chlorine, because, the, effective, nuclear, charge, on, the, outer, electrons, is, 7, in, chlorine, but, is, only, 1, in, sodium, the, electron, pair, is, attracted, so, close, to, the, chlorine, atom, that, they, are, practically, transferred, to, the, chlorine, atom, an, ionic, bond, however, if, the, sodium, atom, was, replaced, by, a, lithium, atom, the, electrons, will, not, be, attracted, as, close, to, the, chlorine, atom, as, before, because, the, lithium, atom, is, smaller, making, the, electron, pair, more, strongly, attracted, to, the, closer, effective, nuclear, charge, from, lithium, hence, the, larger, alkali, metal, atoms, further, down, the, group, will, be, less, electronegative, as, the, bonding, pair, is, less, strongly, attracted, towards, them, as, mentioned, previously, francium, is, expected, to, be, an, exception, because, of, the, higher, electronegativity, of, lithium, some, of, its, compounds, have, a, more, covalent, character, for, example, lithium, iodide, lii, will, dissolve, in, organic, solvents, a, property, of, most, covalent, compounds, lithium, fluoride, lif, is, the, only, alkali, halide, that, is, not, soluble, in, water, and, lithium, hydroxide, lioh, is, the, only, alkali, metal, hydroxide, that, is, not, deliquescent, the, melting, point, of, a, substance, is, the, point, where, it, changes, state, from, solid, to, liquid, while, the, boiling, point, of, a, substance, in, liquid, state, is, the, point, where, the, vapour, pressure, of, the, liquid, equals, the, environmental, pressure, surrounding, the, liquid, and, all, the, liquid, changes, state, to, gas, as, a, metal, is, heated, to, its, melting, point, the, metallic, bonds, keeping, the, atoms, in, place, weaken, so, that, the, atoms, can, move, around, and, the, metallic, bonds, eventually, break, completely, at, the, metal, s, boiling, point, therefore, the, falling, melting, and, boiling, points, of, the, alkali, metals, indicate, that, the, strength, of, the, metallic, bonds, of, the, alkali, metals, decreases, down, the, group, this, is, because, metal, atoms, are, held, together, by, the, electromagnetic, attraction, from, the, positive, ions, to, the, delocalised, electrons, as, the, atoms, increase, in, size, going, down, the, group, because, their, atomic, radius, increases, the, nuclei, of, the, ions, move, further, away, from, the, delocalised, electrons, and, hence, the, metallic, bond, becomes, weaker, so, that, the, metal, can, more, easily, melt, and, boil, thus, lowering, the, melting, and, boiling, points, the, increased, nuclear, charge, is, not, a, relevant, factor, due, to, the, shielding, effect, the, alkali, metals, all, have, the, same, crystal, structure, body, centred, cubic, and, thus, the, only, relevant, factors, are, the, number, of, atoms, that, can, fit, into, a, certain, volume, and, the, mass, of, one, of, the, atoms, since, density, is, defined, as, mass, per, unit, volume, the, first, factor, depends, on, the, volume, of, the, atom, and, thus, the, atomic, radius, which, increases, going, down, the, group, thus, the, volume, of, an, alkali, metal, atom, increases, going, down, the, group, the, mass, of, an, alkali, metal, atom, also, increases, going, down, the, group, thus, the, trend, for, the, densities, of, the, alkali, metals, depends, on, their, atomic, weights, and, atomic, radii, if, figures, for, these, two, factors, are, known, the, ratios, between, the, densities, of, the, alkali, metals, can, then, be, calculated, the, resultant, trend, is, that, the, densities, of, the, alkali, metals, increase, down, the, table, with, an, exception, at, potassium, due, to, having, the, lowest, atomic, weight, and, the, largest, atomic, radius, of, all, the, elements, in, their, periods, the, alkali, metals, are, the, least, dense, metals, in, the, periodic, table, lithium, sodium, and, potassium, are, the, only, three, metals, in, the, periodic, table, that, are, less, dense, than, water, in, fact, lithium, is, the, least, dense, known, solid, at, room, temperature, 75, the, alkali, metals, form, complete, series, of, compounds, with, all, usually, encountered, anions, which, well, illustrate, group, trends, these, compounds, can, be, described, as, involving, the, alkali, metals, losing, electrons, to, acceptor, species, and, forming, monopositive, ions, 79, this, description, is, most, accurate, for, alkali, halides, and, becomes, less, and, less, accurate, as, cationic, and, anionic, charge, increase, and, as, the, anion, becomes, larger, and, more, polarisable, for, instance, ionic, bonding, gives, way, to, metallic, bonding, along, the, series, nacl, na, 2, o, na, 2, s, na, 3, p, na, 3, as, na, 3, sb, na, 3, bi, na, 81, all, the, alkali, metals, react, vigorously, or, explosively, with, cold, water, producing, an, aqueous, solution, of, a, strongly, basic, alkali, metal, hydroxide, and, releasing, hydrogen, gas, this, reaction, becomes, more, vigorous, going, down, the, group, lithium, reacts, steadily, with, effervescence, but, sodium, and, potassium, can, ignite, and, rubidium, and, caesium, sink, in, water, and, generate, hydrogen, gas, so, rapidly, that, shock, waves, form, in, the, water, that, may, shatter, glass, containers, when, an, alkali, metal, is, dropped, into, water, it, produces, an, explosion, of, which, there, are, two, separate, stages, the, metal, reacts, with, the, water, first, breaking, the, hydrogen, bonds, in, the, water, and, producing, hydrogen, gas, this, takes, place, faster, for, the, more, reactive, heavier, alkali, metals, second, the, heat, generated, by, the, first, part, of, the, reaction, often, ignites, the, hydrogen, gas, causing, it, to, burn, explosively, into, the, surrounding, air, this, secondary, hydrogen, gas, explosion, produces, the, visible, flame, above, the, bowl, of, water, lake, or, other, body, of, water, not, the, initial, reaction, of, the, metal, with, water, which, tends, to, happen, mostly, under, water, the, alkali, metal, hydroxides, are, the, most, basic, known, hydroxides, 87, recent, research, has, suggested, that, the, explosive, behavior, of, alkali, metals, in, water, is, driven, by, a, coulomb, explosion, rather, than, solely, by, rapid, generation, of, hydrogen, itself, all, alkali, metals, melt, as, a, part, of, the, reaction, with, water, water, molecules, ionise, the, bare, metallic, surface, of, the, liquid, metal, leaving, a, positively, charged, metal, surface, and, negatively, charged, water, ions, the, attraction, between, the, charged, metal, and, water, ions, will, rapidly, increase, the, surface, area, causing, an, exponential, increase, of, ionisation, when, the, repulsive, forces, within, the, liquid, metal, surface, exceeds, the, forces, of, the, surface, tension, it, vigorously, explodes, the, hydroxides, themselves, are, the, most, basic, hydroxides, known, reacting, with, acids, to, give, salts, and, with, alcohols, to, give, oligomeric, alkoxides, they, easily, react, with, carbon, dioxide, to, form, carbonates, or, bicarbonates, or, with, hydrogen, sulfide, to, form, sulfides, or, bisulfides, and, may, be, used, to, separate, thiols, from, petroleum, they, react, with, amphoteric, oxides, for, example, the, oxides, of, aluminium, zinc, tin, and, lead, react, with, the, alkali, metal, hydroxides, to, give, aluminates, zincates, stannates, and, plumbates, silicon, dioxide, is, acidic, and, thus, the, alkali, metal, hydroxides, can, also, attack, silicate, glass, 87, the, alkali, metals, form, many, intermetallic, compounds, with, each, other, and, the, elements, from, groups, 2, to, 13, in, the, periodic, table, of, varying, stoichiometries, 81, such, as, the, sodium, amalgams, with, mercury, including, na, 5, hg, 8, and, na, 3, hg, some, of, these, have, ionic, characteristics, taking, the, alloys, with, gold, the, most, electronegative, of, metals, as, an, example, naau, and, kau, are, metallic, but, rbau, and, csau, are, semiconductors, 81, nak, is, an, alloy, of, sodium, and, potassium, that, is, very, useful, because, it, is, liquid, at, room, temperature, although, precautions, must, be, taken, due, to, its, extreme, reactivity, towards, water, and, air, the, eutectic, mixture, melts, at, 12, 6, c, an, alloy, of, 41, caesium, 47, sodium, and, 12, potassium, has, the, lowest, known, melting, point, of, any, metal, or, alloy, 78, c, the, intermetallic, compounds, of, the, alkali, metals, with, the, heavier, group, 13, elements, aluminium, gallium, indium, and, thallium, such, as, natl, are, poor, conductors, or, semiconductors, unlike, the, normal, alloys, with, the, preceding, elements, implying, that, the, alkali, metal, involved, has, lost, an, electron, to, the, zintl, anions, involved, nevertheless, while, the, elements, in, group, 14, and, beyond, tend, to, form, discrete, anionic, clusters, group, 13, elements, tend, to, form, polymeric, ions, with, the, alkali, metal, cations, located, between, the, giant, ionic, lattice, for, example, natl, consists, of, a, polymeric, anion, tl, n, with, a, covalent, diamond, cubic, structure, with, na, ions, located, between, the, anionic, lattice, the, larger, alkali, metals, cannot, fit, similarly, into, an, anionic, lattice, and, tend, to, force, the, heavier, group, 13, elements, to, form, anionic, clusters, boron, is, a, special, case, being, the, only, nonmetal, in, group, 13, the, alkali, metal, borides, tend, to, be, boron, rich, involving, appreciable, boron, boron, bonding, involving, deltahedral, structures, 147, 8, and, are, thermally, unstable, due, to, the, alkali, metals, having, a, very, high, vapour, pressure, at, elevated, temperatures, this, makes, direct, synthesis, problematic, because, the, alkali, metals, do, not, react, with, boron, below, 700, c, and, thus, this, must, be, accomplished, in, sealed, containers, with, the, alkali, metal, in, excess, furthermore, exceptionally, in, this, group, reactivity, with, boron, decreases, down, the, group, lithium, reacts, completely, at, 700, c, but, sodium, at, 900, c, and, potassium, not, until, 1200, c, and, the, reaction, is, instantaneous, for, lithium, but, takes, hours, for, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, borides, have, not, even, been, characterised, various, phases, are, known, such, as, lib, 10, nab, 6, nab, 15, and, kb, 6, under, high, pressure, the, boron, boron, bonding, in, the, lithium, borides, changes, from, following, wade, s, rules, to, forming, zintl, anions, like, the, rest, of, group, 13, lithium, and, sodium, react, with, carbon, to, form, acetylides, li, 2, c, 2, and, na, 2, c, 2, which, can, also, be, obtained, by, reaction, of, the, metal, with, acetylene, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, react, with, graphite, their, atoms, are, intercalated, between, the, hexagonal, graphite, layers, forming, graphite, intercalation, compounds, of, formulae, mc, 60, dark, grey, almost, black, mc, 48, dark, grey, almost, black, mc, 36, blue, mc, 24, steel, blue, and, mc, 8, bronze, m, k, rb, or, cs, these, compounds, are, over, 200, times, more, electrically, conductive, than, pure, graphite, suggesting, that, the, valence, electron, of, the, alkali, metal, is, transferred, to, the, graphite, layers, e, g, m, c, 8, upon, heating, of, kc, 8, the, elimination, of, potassium, atoms, results, in, the, conversion, in, sequence, to, kc, 24, kc, 36, kc, 48, and, finally, kc, 60, kc, 8, is, a, very, strong, reducing, agent, and, is, pyrophoric, and, explodes, on, contact, with, water, while, the, larger, alkali, metals, k, rb, and, cs, initially, form, mc, 8, the, smaller, ones, initially, form, mc, 6, and, indeed, they, require, reaction, of, the, metals, with, graphite, at, high, temperatures, around, 500, c, to, form, apart, from, this, the, alkali, metals, are, such, strong, reducing, agents, that, they, can, even, reduce, buckminsterfullerene, to, produce, solid, fullerides, m, n, c, 60, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, can, form, fullerides, where, n, 2, 3, 4, or, 6, and, rubidium, and, caesium, additionally, can, achieve, n, 1, 285, when, the, alkali, metals, react, with, the, heavier, elements, in, the, carbon, group, silicon, germanium, tin, and, lead, ionic, substances, with, cage, like, structures, are, formed, such, as, the, silicides, m, 4, si, 4, m, k, rb, or, cs, which, contains, m, and, tetrahedral, si, 4, 4, ions, the, chemistry, of, alkali, metal, germanides, involving, the, germanide, ion, ge, 4, and, other, cluster, zintl, ions, such, as, ge, 2, 4, ge, 4, 9, ge, 2, 9, and, 6, is, largely, analogous, to, that, of, the, corresponding, silicides, 393, alkali, metal, stannides, are, mostly, ionic, sometimes, with, the, stannide, ion, sn, 4, and, sometimes, with, more, complex, zintl, ions, such, as, sn, 4, 9, which, appears, in, tetrapotassium, nonastannide, k, 4, sn, 9, the, monatomic, plumbide, ion, pb, 4, is, unknown, and, indeed, its, formation, is, predicted, to, be, energetically, unfavourable, alkali, metal, plumbides, have, complex, zintl, ions, such, as, pb, 4, 9, these, alkali, metal, germanides, stannides, and, plumbides, may, be, produced, by, reducing, germanium, tin, and, lead, with, sodium, metal, in, liquid, ammonia, 394, lithium, the, lightest, of, the, alkali, metals, is, the, only, alkali, metal, which, reacts, with, nitrogen, at, standard, conditions, and, its, nitride, is, the, only, stable, alkali, metal, nitride, nitrogen, is, an, unreactive, gas, because, breaking, the, strong, triple, bond, in, the, dinitrogen, molecule, n, 2, requires, a, lot, of, energy, the, formation, of, an, alkali, metal, nitride, would, consume, the, ionisation, energy, of, the, alkali, metal, forming, m, ions, the, energy, required, to, break, the, triple, bond, in, n, 2, and, the, formation, of, n, 3, ions, and, all, the, energy, released, from, the, formation, of, an, alkali, metal, nitride, is, from, the, lattice, energy, of, the, alkali, metal, nitride, the, lattice, energy, is, maximised, with, small, highly, charged, ions, the, alkali, metals, do, not, form, highly, charged, ions, only, forming, ions, with, a, charge, of, 1, so, only, lithium, the, smallest, alkali, metal, can, release, enough, lattice, energy, to, make, the, reaction, with, nitrogen, exothermic, forming, lithium, nitride, the, reactions, of, the, other, alkali, metals, with, nitrogen, would, not, release, enough, lattice, energy, and, would, thus, be, endothermic, so, they, do, not, form, nitrides, at, standard, conditions, sodium, nitride, na, 3, n, and, potassium, nitride, k, 3, n, while, existing, are, extremely, unstable, being, prone, to, decomposing, back, into, their, constituent, elements, and, cannot, be, produced, by, reacting, the, elements, with, each, other, at, standard, conditions, steric, hindrance, forbids, the, existence, of, rubidium, or, caesium, nitride, 417, however, sodium, and, potassium, form, colourless, azide, salts, involving, the, linear, n, 3, anion, due, to, the, large, size, of, the, alkali, metal, cations, they, are, thermally, stable, enough, to, be, able, to, melt, before, decomposing, 417, all, the, alkali, metals, react, readily, with, phosphorus, and, arsenic, to, form, phosphides, and, arsenides, with, the, formula, m, 3, pn, where, m, represents, an, alkali, metal, and, pn, represents, a, pnictogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or, bismuth, this, is, due, to, the, greater, size, of, the, p, 3, and, as, 3, ions, so, that, less, lattice, energy, needs, to, be, released, for, the, salts, to, form, these, are, not, the, only, phosphides, and, arsenides, of, the, alkali, metals, for, example, potassium, has, nine, different, known, phosphides, with, formulae, k, 3, p, k, 4, p, 3, k, 5, p, 4, kp, k, 4, p, 6, k, 3, p, 7, k, 3, p, 11, kp, 10, 3, and, kp, 15, while, most, metals, form, arsenides, only, the, alkali, and, alkaline, earth, metals, form, mostly, ionic, arsenides, the, structure, of, na, 3, as, is, complex, with, unusually, short, na, na, distances, of, 328, 330, pm, which, are, shorter, than, in, sodium, metal, and, this, indicates, that, even, with, these, electropositive, metals, the, bonding, cannot, be, straightforwardly, ionic, other, alkali, metal, arsenides, not, conforming, to, the, formula, m, 3, as, are, known, such, as, lias, which, has, a, metallic, lustre, and, electrical, conductivity, indicating, the, presence, of, some, metallic, bonding, the, antimonides, are, unstable, and, reactive, as, the, sb, 3, ion, is, a, strong, reducing, agent, reaction, of, them, with, acids, form, the, toxic, and, unstable, gas, stibine, sbh, 3, indeed, they, have, some, metallic, properties, and, the, alkali, metal, antimonides, of, stoichiometry, msb, involve, antimony, atoms, bonded, in, a, spiral, zintl, structure, bismuthides, are, not, even, wholly, ionic, they, are, intermetallic, compounds, containing, partially, metallic, and, partially, ionic, bonds, all, the, alkali, metals, react, vigorously, with, oxygen, at, standard, conditions, they, form, various, types, of, oxides, such, as, simple, oxides, containing, the, o, 2, ion, peroxides, containing, the, o, 2, 2, ion, where, there, is, a, single, bond, between, the, two, oxygen, atoms, superoxides, containing, the, o, 2, ion, and, many, others, lithium, burns, in, air, to, form, lithium, oxide, but, sodium, reacts, with, oxygen, to, form, a, mixture, of, sodium, oxide, and, sodium, peroxide, potassium, forms, a, mixture, of, potassium, peroxide, and, potassium, superoxide, while, rubidium, and, caesium, form, the, superoxide, exclusively, their, reactivity, increases, going, down, the, group, while, lithium, sodium, and, potassium, merely, burn, in, air, rubidium, and, caesium, are, pyrophoric, spontaneously, catch, fire, in, air, the, smaller, alkali, metals, tend, to, polarise, the, larger, anions, the, peroxide, and, superoxide, due, to, their, small, size, this, attracts, the, electrons, in, the, more, complex, anions, towards, one, of, its, constituent, oxygen, atoms, forming, an, oxide, ion, and, an, oxygen, atom, this, causes, lithium, to, form, the, oxide, exclusively, on, reaction, with, oxygen, at, room, temperature, this, effect, becomes, drastically, weaker, for, the, larger, sodium, and, potassium, allowing, them, to, form, the, less, stable, peroxides, rubidium, and, caesium, at, the, bottom, of, the, group, are, so, large, that, even, the, least, stable, superoxides, can, form, because, the, superoxide, releases, the, most, energy, when, formed, the, superoxide, is, preferentially, formed, for, the, larger, alkali, metals, where, the, more, complex, anions, are, not, polarised, the, oxides, and, peroxides, for, these, alkali, metals, do, exist, but, do, not, form, upon, direct, reaction, of, the, metal, with, oxygen, at, standard, conditions, in, addition, the, small, size, of, the, li, and, o, 2, ions, contributes, to, their, forming, a, stable, ionic, lattice, structure, under, controlled, conditions, however, all, the, alkali, metals, with, the, exception, of, francium, are, known, to, form, their, oxides, peroxides, and, superoxides, the, alkali, metal, peroxides, and, superoxides, are, powerful, oxidising, agents, sodium, peroxide, and, potassium, superoxide, react, with, carbon, dioxide, to, form, the, alkali, metal, carbonate, and, oxygen, gas, which, allows, them, to, be, used, in, submarine, air, purifiers, the, presence, of, water, vapour, naturally, present, in, breath, makes, the, removal, of, carbon, dioxide, by, potassium, superoxide, even, more, efficient, all, the, stable, alkali, metals, except, lithium, can, form, red, ozonides, mo, 3, through, low, temperature, reaction, of, the, powdered, anhydrous, hydroxide, with, ozone, the, ozonides, may, be, then, extracted, using, liquid, ammonia, they, slowly, decompose, at, standard, conditions, to, the, superoxides, and, oxygen, and, hydrolyse, immediately, to, the, hydroxides, when, in, contact, with, water, 85, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, also, form, sesquioxides, m, 2, o, 3, which, may, be, better, considered, peroxide, disuperoxides, 85, rubidium, and, caesium, can, form, a, great, variety, of, suboxides, with, the, metals, in, formal, oxidation, states, below, 1, 85, rubidium, can, form, rb, 6, o, and, rb, 9, o, 2, copper, coloured, upon, oxidation, in, air, while, caesium, forms, an, immense, variety, of, oxides, such, as, the, ozonide, cso, 3, and, several, brightly, coloured, suboxides, such, as, cs, 7, o, bronze, cs, 4, o, red, violet, cs, 11, o, 3, violet, cs, 3, o, dark, green, cso, cs, 3, o, 2, as, well, as, cs, 7, o, 2, the, last, of, these, may, be, heated, under, vacuum, to, generate, cs, 2, o, the, alkali, metals, can, also, react, analogously, with, the, heavier, chalcogens, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and, polonium, and, all, the, alkali, metal, chalcogenides, are, known, with, the, exception, of, francium, s, reaction, with, an, excess, of, the, chalcogen, can, similarly, result, in, lower, chalcogenides, with, chalcogen, ions, containing, chains, of, the, chalcogen, atoms, in, question, for, example, sodium, can, react, with, sulfur, to, form, the, sulfide, na, 2, s, and, various, polysulfides, with, the, formula, na, 2, s, x, x, from, 2, to, 6, containing, the, s, 2, x, ions, due, to, the, basicity, of, the, se, 2, and, te, 2, ions, the, alkali, metal, selenides, and, tellurides, are, alkaline, in, solution, when, reacted, directly, with, selenium, and, tellurium, alkali, metal, polyselenides, and, polytellurides, are, formed, along, with, the, selenides, and, tellurides, with, the, se, 2, x, and, te, 2, x, ions, they, may, be, obtained, directly, from, the, elements, in, liquid, ammonia, or, when, air, is, not, present, and, are, colourless, water, soluble, compounds, that, air, oxidises, quickly, back, to, selenium, or, tellurium, 766, the, alkali, metal, polonides, are, all, ionic, compounds, containing, the, po, 2, ion, they, are, very, chemically, stable, and, can, be, produced, by, direct, reaction, of, the, elements, at, around, 300, 400, c, 766, the, alkali, metals, are, among, the, most, electropositive, elements, on, the, periodic, table, and, thus, tend, to, bond, ionically, to, the, most, electronegative, elements, on, the, periodic, table, the, halogens, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and, astatine, forming, salts, known, as, the, alkali, metal, halides, the, reaction, is, very, vigorous, and, can, sometimes, result, in, explosions, 76, all, twenty, stable, alkali, metal, halides, are, known, the, unstable, ones, are, not, known, with, the, exception, of, sodium, astatide, because, of, the, great, instability, and, rarity, of, astatine, and, francium, the, most, well, known, of, the, twenty, is, certainly, sodium, chloride, otherwise, known, as, common, salt, all, of, the, stable, alkali, metal, halides, have, the, formula, mx, where, m, is, an, alkali, metal, and, x, is, a, halogen, they, are, all, white, ionic, crystalline, solids, that, have, high, melting, points, all, the, alkali, metal, halides, are, soluble, in, water, except, for, lithium, fluoride, lif, which, is, insoluble, in, water, due, to, its, very, high, lattice, enthalpy, the, high, lattice, enthalpy, of, lithium, fluoride, is, due, to, the, small, sizes, of, the, li, and, f, ions, causing, the, electrostatic, interactions, between, them, to, be, strong, a, similar, effect, occurs, for, magnesium, fluoride, consistent, with, the, diagonal, relationship, between, lithium, and, magnesium, 76, the, alkali, metals, also, react, similarly, with, hydrogen, to, form, ionic, alkali, metal, hydrides, where, the, hydride, anion, acts, as, a, pseudohalide, these, are, often, used, as, reducing, agents, producing, hydrides, complex, metal, hydrides, or, hydrogen, gas, 83, other, pseudohalides, are, also, known, notably, the, cyanides, these, are, isostructural, to, the, respective, halides, except, for, lithium, cyanide, indicating, that, the, cyanide, ions, may, rotate, freely, 322, ternary, alkali, metal, halide, oxides, such, as, na, 3, clo, k, 3, bro, yellow, na, 4, br, 2, o, na, 4, i, 2, o, and, k, 4, br, 2, o, are, also, known, 83, the, polyhalides, are, rather, unstable, although, those, of, rubidium, and, caesium, are, greatly, stabilised, by, the, feeble, polarising, power, of, these, extremely, large, cations, 835, alkali, metal, cations, do, not, usually, form, coordination, complexes, with, simple, lewis, bases, due, to, their, low, charge, of, just, 1, and, their, relatively, large, size, thus, the, li, ion, forms, most, complexes, and, the, heavier, alkali, metal, ions, form, less, and, less, though, exceptions, occur, for, weak, complexes, 90, lithium, in, particular, has, a, very, rich, coordination, chemistry, in, which, it, exhibits, coordination, numbers, from, 1, to, 12, although, octahedral, hexacoordination, is, its, preferred, mode, 90, 1, in, aqueous, solution, the, alkali, metal, ions, exist, as, octahedral, hexahydrate, complexes, with, the, exception, of, the, lithium, ion, which, due, to, its, small, size, forms, tetrahedral, tetrahydrate, complexes, the, alkali, metals, form, these, complexes, because, their, ions, are, attracted, by, electrostatic, forces, of, attraction, to, the, polar, water, molecules, because, of, this, anhydrous, salts, containing, alkali, metal, cations, are, often, used, as, desiccants, alkali, metals, also, readily, form, complexes, with, crown, ethers, e, g, 12, crown, 4, for, li, 15, crown, 5, for, na, 18, crown, 6, for, k, and, 21, crown, 7, for, rb, and, cryptands, due, to, electrostatic, attraction, the, alkali, metals, dissolve, slowly, in, liquid, ammonia, forming, ammoniacal, solutions, of, solvated, metal, cation, m, and, solvated, electron, e, which, react, to, form, hydrogen, gas, and, the, alkali, metal, amide, mnh, 2, where, m, represents, an, alkali, metal, this, was, first, noted, by, humphry, davy, in, 1809, and, rediscovered, by, w, weyl, in, 1864, the, process, may, be, speeded, up, by, a, catalyst, similar, solutions, are, formed, by, the, heavy, divalent, alkaline, earth, metals, calcium, strontium, barium, as, well, as, the, divalent, lanthanides, europium, and, ytterbium, the, amide, salt, is, quite, insoluble, and, readily, precipitates, out, of, solution, leaving, intensely, coloured, ammonia, solutions, of, the, alkali, metals, in, 1907, charles, a, kraus, identified, the, colour, as, being, due, to, the, presence, of, solvated, electrons, which, contribute, to, the, high, electrical, conductivity, of, these, solutions, at, low, concentrations, below, 3, m, the, solution, is, dark, blue, and, has, ten, times, the, conductivity, of, aqueous, sodium, chloride, at, higher, concentrations, above, 3, m, the, solution, is, copper, coloured, and, has, approximately, the, conductivity, of, liquid, metals, like, mercury, in, addition, to, the, alkali, metal, amide, salt, and, solvated, electrons, such, ammonia, solutions, also, contain, the, alkali, metal, cation, m, the, neutral, alkali, metal, atom, m, diatomic, alkali, metal, molecules, m, 2, and, alkali, metal, anions, m, these, are, unstable, and, eventually, become, the, more, thermodynamically, stable, alkali, metal, amide, and, hydrogen, gas, solvated, electrons, are, powerful, reducing, agents, and, are, often, used, in, chemical, synthesis, being, the, smallest, alkali, metal, lithium, forms, the, widest, variety, of, and, most, stable, organometallic, compounds, which, are, bonded, covalently, organolithium, compounds, are, electrically, non, conducting, volatile, solids, or, liquids, that, melt, at, low, temperatures, and, tend, to, form, oligomers, with, the, structure, rli, x, where, r, is, the, organic, group, as, the, electropositive, nature, of, lithium, puts, most, of, the, charge, density, of, the, bond, on, the, carbon, atom, effectively, creating, a, carbanion, organolithium, compounds, are, extremely, powerful, bases, and, nucleophiles, for, use, as, bases, butyllithiums, are, often, used, and, are, commercially, available, an, example, of, an, organolithium, compound, is, methyllithium, ch, 3, li, x, which, exists, in, tetrameric, x, 4, tetrahedral, and, hexameric, x, 6, octahedral, forms, organolithium, compounds, especially, n, butyllithium, are, useful, reagents, in, organic, synthesis, as, might, be, expected, given, lithium, s, diagonal, relationship, with, magnesium, which, plays, an, important, role, in, the, grignard, reaction, 102, for, example, alkyllithiums, and, aryllithiums, may, be, used, to, synthesise, aldehydes, and, ketones, by, reaction, with, metal, carbonyls, the, reaction, with, nickel, tetracarbonyl, for, example, proceeds, through, an, unstable, acyl, nickel, carbonyl, complex, which, then, undergoes, electrophilic, substitution, to, give, the, desired, aldehyde, using, h, as, the, electrophile, or, ketone, using, an, alkyl, halide, product, 105, alkyllithiums, and, aryllithiums, may, also, react, with, n, n, disubstituted, amides, to, give, aldehydes, and, ketones, and, symmetrical, ketones, by, reacting, with, carbon, monoxide, they, thermally, decompose, to, eliminate, a, hydrogen, producing, alkenes, and, lithium, hydride, another, route, is, the, reaction, of, ethers, with, alkyl, and, aryllithiums, that, act, as, strong, bases, 105, in, non, polar, solvents, aryllithiums, react, as, the, carbanions, they, effectively, are, turning, carbon, dioxide, to, aromatic, carboxylic, acids, arco, 2, h, and, aryl, ketones, to, tertiary, carbinols, ar, 2, c, ar, oh, finally, they, may, be, used, to, synthesise, other, organometallic, compounds, through, metal, halogen, exchange, 106, unlike, the, organolithium, compounds, the, organometallic, compounds, of, the, heavier, alkali, metals, are, predominantly, ionic, the, application, of, organosodium, compounds, in, chemistry, is, limited, in, part, due, to, competition, from, organolithium, compounds, which, are, commercially, available, and, exhibit, more, convenient, reactivity, the, principal, organosodium, compound, of, commercial, importance, is, sodium, cyclopentadienide, sodium, tetraphenylborate, can, also, be, classified, as, an, organosodium, compound, since, in, the, solid, state, sodium, is, bound, to, the, aryl, groups, organometallic, compounds, of, the, higher, alkali, metals, are, even, more, reactive, than, organosodium, compounds, and, of, limited, utility, a, notable, reagent, is, schlosser, s, base, a, mixture, of, n, butyllithium, and, potassium, tert, butoxide, this, reagent, reacts, with, propene, to, form, the, compound, allylpotassium, kch, 2, chch, 2, cis, 2, butene, and, trans, 2, butene, equilibrate, when, in, contact, with, alkali, metals, whereas, isomerisation, is, fast, with, lithium, and, sodium, it, is, slow, with, the, heavier, alkali, metals, the, heavier, alkali, metals, also, favour, the, sterically, congested, conformation, several, crystal, structures, of, organopotassium, compounds, have, been, reported, establishing, that, they, like, the, sodium, compounds, are, polymeric, organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium, and, organocaesium, compounds, are, all, mostly, ionic, and, are, insoluble, or, nearly, so, in, nonpolar, solvents, alkyl, and, aryl, derivatives, of, sodium, and, potassium, tend, to, react, with, air, they, cause, the, cleavage, of, ethers, generating, alkoxides, unlike, alkyllithium, compounds, alkylsodiums, and, alkylpotassiums, cannot, be, made, by, reacting, the, metals, with, alkyl, halides, because, wurtz, coupling, occurs, 265, as, such, they, have, to, be, made, by, reacting, alkylmercury, compounds, with, sodium, or, potassium, metal, in, inert, hydrocarbon, solvents, while, methylsodium, forms, tetramers, like, methyllithium, methylpotassium, is, more, ionic, and, has, the, nickel, arsenide, structure, with, discrete, methyl, anions, and, potassium, cations, 265, the, alkali, metals, and, their, hydrides, react, with, acidic, hydrocarbons, for, example, cyclopentadienes, and, terminal, alkynes, to, give, salts, liquid, ammonia, ether, or, hydrocarbon, solvents, are, used, the, most, common, of, which, being, tetrahydrofuran, the, most, important, of, these, compounds, is, sodium, cyclopentadienide, nac, 5, h, 5, an, important, precursor, to, many, transition, metal, cyclopentadienyl, derivatives, 265, similarly, the, alkali, metals, react, with, cyclooctatetraene, in, tetrahydrofuran, to, give, alkali, metal, cyclooctatetraenides, for, example, dipotassium, cyclooctatetraenide, k, 2, c, 8, h, 8, is, an, important, precursor, to, many, metal, cyclooctatetraenyl, derivatives, such, as, uranocene, 266, the, large, and, very, weakly, polarising, alkali, metal, cations, can, stabilise, large, aromatic, polarisable, radical, anions, such, as, the, dark, green, sodium, naphthalenide, na, a, strong, reducing, agent, 266, upon, reacting, with, oxygen, alkali, metals, form, oxides, peroxides, superoxides, and, suboxides, however, the, first, three, are, more, common, the, table, below, shows, the, types, of, compounds, formed, in, reaction, with, oxygen, the, compound, in, brackets, represents, the, minor, product, of, combustion, the, alkali, metal, peroxides, are, ionic, compounds, that, are, unstable, in, water, the, peroxide, anion, is, weakly, bound, to, the, cation, and, it, is, hydrolysed, forming, stronger, covalent, bonds, the, other, oxygen, compounds, are, also, unstable, in, water, with, sulfur, they, form, sulfides, and, polysulfides, because, alkali, metal, sulfides, are, essentially, salts, of, a, weak, acid, and, a, strong, base, they, form, basic, solutions, lithium, is, the, only, metal, that, combines, directly, with, nitrogen, at, room, temperature, li, 3, n, can, react, with, water, to, liberate, ammonia, with, hydrogen, alkali, metals, form, saline, hydrides, that, hydrolyse, in, water, lithium, is, the, only, metal, that, reacts, directly, with, carbon, to, give, dilithium, acetylide, na, and, k, can, react, with, acetylene, to, give, acetylides, 2, na, 2, c, 2, h, 2, 150, o, c, 2, nac, 2, h, h, 2, displaystyle, ce, 2na, 2c2h2, 2nac2h, h2, 2, na, 2, nac, 2, h,

exothermic, and, the, hydrogen, resulted, may, ignite, in, air, or, even, explode, in, the, case, of, rb, and, cs, the, alkali, metals, are, very, good, reducing, agents, they, can, reduce, metal, cations, that, are, less, electropositive, titanium, is, produced, industrially, by, the, reduction, of, titanium, tetrachloride, with, na, at, 400, c, van, arkel, de, boer, process, alkali, metals, react, with, halogen, derivatives, to, generate, hydrocarbon, via, the, wurtz, reaction, alkali, metals, dissolve, in, liquid, ammonia, or, other, donor, solvents, like, aliphatic, amines, or, hexamethylphosphoramide, to, give, blue, solutions, these, solutions, are, believed, to, contain, free, electrons, due, to, the, presence, of, solvated, electrons, these, solutions, are, very, powerful, reducing, agents, used, in, organic, synthesis, reaction, 1, is, known, as, birch, reduction, other, reductions, that, can, be, carried, by, these, solutions, are, although, francium, is, the, heaviest, alkali, metal, that, has, been, discovered, there, has, been, some, theoretical, work, predicting, the, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, of, hypothetical, heavier, alkali, metals, being, the, first, period, 8, element, the, undiscovered, element, ununennium, element, 119, is, predicted, to, be, the, next, alkali, metal, after, francium, and, behave, much, like, their, lighter, congeners, however, it, is, also, predicted, to, differ, from, the, lighter, alkali, metals, in, some, properties, 1729, 1730, its, chemistry, is, predicted, to, be, closer, to, that, of, potassium, or, rubidium, 1729, 1730, instead, of, caesium, or, francium, this, is, unusual, as, periodic, trends, ignoring, relativistic, effects, would, predict, ununennium, to, be, even, more, reactive, than, caesium, and, francium, this, lowered, reactivity, is, due, to, the, relativistic, stabilisation, of, ununennium, s, valence, electron, increasing, ununennium, s, first, ionisation, energy, and, decreasing, the, metallic, and, ionic, radii, this, effect, is, already, seen, for, francium, 1729, 1730, this, assumes, that, ununennium, will, behave, chemically, as, an, alkali, metal, which, although, likely, may, not, be, true, due, to, relativistic, effects, the, relativistic, stabilisation, of, the, 8s, orbital, also, increases, ununennium, s, electron, affinity, far, beyond, that, of, caesium, and, francium, indeed, ununennium, is, expected, to, have, an, electron, affinity, higher, than, all, the, alkali, metals, lighter, than, it, relativistic, effects, also, cause, a, very, large, drop, in, the, polarisability, of, ununennium, 1729, 1730, on, the, other, hand, ununennium, is, predicted, to, continue, the, trend, of, melting, points, decreasing, going, down, the, group, being, expected, to, have, a, melting, point, between, 0, c, and, 30, c, 1724, the, stabilisation, of, ununennium, s, valence, electron, and, thus, the, contraction, of, the, 8s, orbital, cause, its, atomic, radius, to, be, lowered, to, 240, pm, 1729, 1730, very, close, to, that, of, rubidium, 247, pm, so, that, the, chemistry, of, ununennium, in, the, 1, oxidation, state, should, be, more, similar, to, the, chemistry, of, rubidium, than, to, that, of, francium, on, the, other, hand, the, ionic, radius, of, the, uue, ion, is, predicted, to, be, larger, than, that, of, rb, because, the, 7p, orbitals, are, destabilised, and, are, thus, larger, than, the, p, orbitals, of, the, lower, shells, ununennium, may, also, show, the, 3, 1729, 1730, and, 5, oxidation, states, which, are, not, seen, in, any, other, alkali, metal, 28, in, addition, to, the, 1, oxidation, state, that, is, characteristic, of, the, other, alkali, metals, and, is, also, the, main, oxidation, state, of, all, the, known, alkali, metals, this, is, because, of, the, destabilisation, and, expansion, of, the, 7p, 3, 2, spinor, causing, its, outermost, electrons, to, have, a, lower, ionisation, energy, than, what, would, otherwise, be, expected, 28, 1729, 1730, indeed, many, ununennium, compounds, are, expected, to, have, a, large, covalent, character, due, to, the, involvement, of, the, 7p, 3, 2, electrons, in, the, bonding, not, as, much, work, has, been, done, predicting, the, properties, of, the, alkali, metals, beyond, ununennium, although, a, simple, extrapolation, of, the, periodic, table, by, the, aufbau, principle, would, put, element, 169, unhexennium, under, ununennium, dirac, fock, calculations, predict, that, the, next, element, after, ununennium, with, alkali, metal, like, properties, may, be, element, 165, unhexpentium, which, is, predicted, to, have, the, electron, configuration, 5g, 18, 6f, 14, 7d, 10, 8s, 2, 8p, 1, 2, 2, 9s, 1, 1729, 1730, this, element, would, be, intermediate, in, properties, between, an, alkali, metal, and, a, group, 11, element, and, while, its, physical, and, atomic, properties, would, be, closer, to, the, former, its, chemistry, may, be, closer, to, that, of, the, latter, further, calculations, show, that, unhexpentium, would, follow, the, trend, of, increasing, ionisation, energy, beyond, caesium, having, an, ionisation, energy, comparable, to, that, of, sodium, and, that, it, should, also, continue, the, trend, of, decreasing, atomic, radii, beyond, caesium, having, an, atomic, radius, comparable, to, that, of, potassium, 1729, 1730, however, the, 7d, electrons, of, unhexpentium, may, also, be, able, to, participate, in, chemical, reactions, along, with, the, 9s, electron, possibly, allowing, oxidation, states, beyond, 1, whence, the, likely, transition, metal, behaviour, of, unhexpentium, 1732, 1733, due, to, the, alkali, and, alkaline, earth, metals, both, being, s, block, elements, these, predictions, for, the, trends, and, properties, of, ununennium, and, unhexpentium, also, mostly, hold, quite, similarly, for, the, corresponding, alkaline, earth, metals, unbinilium, ubn, and, unhexhexium, uhh, 1729, 1733, unsepttrium, element, 173, may, be, an, even, better, heavier, homologue, of, ununennium, with, a, predicted, electron, configuration, of, 6g, 1, it, returns, to, the, alkali, metal, like, situation, of, having, one, easily, removed, electron, far, above, a, closed, p, shell, in, energy, and, is, expected, to, be, even, more, reactive, than, caesium, the, probable, properties, of, further, alkali, metals, beyond, unsepttrium, have, not, been, explored, yet, as, of, 2019, and, they, may, or, may, not, be, able, to, exist, in, periods, 8, and, above, of, the, periodic, table, relativistic, and, shell, structure, effects, become, so, strong, that, extrapolations, from, lighter, congeners, become, completely, inaccurate, in, addition, the, relativistic, and, shell, structure, effects, which, stabilise, the, s, orbitals, and, destabilise, and, expand, the, d, f, and, g, orbitals, of, higher, shells, have, opposite, effects, causing, even, larger, difference, between, relativistic, and, non, relativistic, calculations, of, the, properties, of, elements, with, such, high, atomic, numbers, 1732, 1733, interest, in, the, chemical, properties, of, ununennium, unhexpentium, and, unsepttrium, stems, from, the, fact, that, they, are, located, close, to, the, expected, locations, of, islands, of, stability, centered, at, elements, 122, 306, ubb, and, 164, 482, uhq, many, other, substances, are, similar, to, the, alkali, metals, in, their, tendency, to, form, monopositive, cations, analogously, to, the, pseudohalogens, they, have, sometimes, been, called, pseudo, alkali, metals, these, substances, include, some, elements, and, many, more, polyatomic, ions, the, polyatomic, ions, are, especially, similar, to, the, alkali, metals, in, their, large, size, and, weak, polarising, power, the, element, hydrogen, with, one, electron, per, neutral, atom, is, usually, placed, at, the, top, of, group, 1, of, the, periodic, table, because, of, its, electron, configuration, but, hydrogen, is, not, normally, considered, to, be, an, alkali, metal, metallic, hydrogen, which, only, exists, at, very, high, pressures, is, known, for, its, electrical, and, magnetic, properties, not, its, chemical, properties, under, typical, conditions, pure, hydrogen, exists, as, a, diatomic, gas, consisting, of, two, atoms, per, molecule, h, 2, however, the, alkali, metals, form, diatomic, molecules, such, as, dilithium, li, 2, only, at, high, temperatures, when, they, are, in, the, gaseous, state, hydrogen, like, the, alkali, metals, has, one, valence, electron, and, reacts, easily, with, the, halogens, but, the, similarities, mostly, end, there, because, of, the, small, size, of, a, bare, proton, h, compared, to, the, alkali, metal, cations, its, placement, above, lithium, is, primarily, due, to, its, electron, configuration, it, is, sometimes, placed, above, fluorine, due, to, their, similar, chemical, properties, though, the, resemblance, is, likewise, not, absolute, the, first, ionisation, energy, of, hydrogen, 1312, 0, kj, mol, is, much, higher, than, that, of, the, alkali, metals, as, only, one, additional, electron, is, required, to, fill, in, the, outermost, shell, of, the, hydrogen, atom, hydrogen, often, behaves, like, a, halogen, forming, the, negative, hydride, ion, and, is, very, occasionally, considered, to, be, a, halogen, on, that, basis, the, alkali, metals, can, also, form, negative, ions, known, as, alkalides, but, these, are, little, more, than, laboratory, curiosities, being, unstable, an, argument, against, this, placement, is, that, formation, of, hydride, from, hydrogen, is, endothermic, unlike, the, exothermic, formation, of, halides, from, halogens, the, radius, of, the, h, anion, also, does, not, fit, the, trend, of, increasing, size, going, down, the, halogens, indeed, h, is, very, diffuse, because, its, single, proton, cannot, easily, control, both, electrons, 15, 6, it, was, expected, for, some, time, that, liquid, hydrogen, would, show, metallic, properties, while, this, has, been, shown, to, not, be, the, case, under, extremely, high, pressures, such, as, those, found, at, the, cores, of, jupiter, and, saturn, hydrogen, does, become, metallic, and, behaves, like, an, alkali, metal, in, this, phase, it, is, known, as, metallic, hydrogen, the, electrical, resistivity, of, liquid, metallic, hydrogen, at, 3000, k, is, approximately, equal, to, that, of, liquid, rubidium, and, caesium, at, 2000, k, at, the, respective, pressures, when, they, undergo, a, nonmetal, to, metal, transition, the, 1s, 1, electron, configuration, of, hydrogen, while, analogous, to, that, of, the, alkali, metals, ns, 1, is, unique, because, there, is, no, 1p, subshell, hence, it, can, lose, an, electron, to, form, the, hydron, h, or, gain, one, to, form, the, hydride, ion, h, 43, in, the, former, case, it, resembles, superficially, the, alkali, metals, in, the, latter, case, the, halogens, but, the, differences, due, to, the, lack, of, a, 1p, subshell, are, important, enough, that, neither, group, fits, the, properties, of, hydrogen, well, 43, group, 14, is, also, a, good, fit, in, terms, of, thermodynamic, properties, such, as, ionisation, energy, and, electron, affinity, but, hydrogen, cannot, be, tetravalent, thus, none, of, the, three, placements, are, entirely, satisfactory, although, group, 1, is, the, most, common, placement, if, one, is, chosen, because, of, the, electron, configuration, and, the, fact, that, the, hydron, is, by, far, the, most, important, of, all, monatomic, hydrogen, species, being, the, foundation, of, acid, base, chemistry, as, an, example, of, hydrogen, s, unorthodox, properties, stemming, from, its, unusual, electron, configuration, and, small, size, the, hydrogen, ion, is, very, small, radius, around, 150, fm, compared, to, the, 50, 220, pm, size, of, most, other, atoms, and, ions, and, so, is, nonexistent, in, condensed, systems, other, than, in, association, with, other, atoms, or, molecules, indeed, transferring, of, protons, between, chemicals, is, the, basis, of, acid, base, chemistry, 43, also, unique, is, hydrogen, s, ability, to, form, hydrogen, bonds, which, are, an, effect, of, charge, transfer, electrostatic, and, electron, correlative, contributing, phenomena, while, analogous, lithium, bonds, are, also, known, they, are, mostly, electrostatic, nevertheless, hydrogen, can, take, on, the, same, structural, role, as, the, alkali, metals, in, some, molecular, crystals, and, has, a, close, relationship, with, the, lightest, alkali, metals, especially, lithium, the, ammonium, ion, nh, 4, has, very, similar, properties, to, the, heavier, alkali, metals, acting, as, an, alkali, metal, intermediate, between, potassium, and, rubidium, and, is, often, considered, a, close, relative, for, example, most, alkali, metal, salts, are, soluble, in, water, a, property, which, ammonium, salts, share, ammonium, is, expected, to, behave, stably, as, a, metal, nh, 4, ions, in, a, sea, of, delocalised, electrons, at, very, high, pressures, though, less, than, the, typical, pressure, where, transitions, from, insulating, to, metallic, behaviour, occur, around, 100, gpa, and, could, possibly, occur, inside, the, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, which, may, have, significant, impacts, on, their, interior, magnetic, fields, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, transition, from, a, mixture, of, ammonia, and, dihydrogen, molecules, to, metallic, ammonium, may, occur, at, pressures, just, below, 25, gpa, under, standard, conditions, ammonium, can, form, a, metallic, amalgam, with, mercury, other, pseudo, alkali, metals, include, the, alkylammonium, cations, in, which, some, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, in, the, ammonium, cation, are, replaced, by, alkyl, or, aryl, groups, in, particular, the, quaternary, ammonium, cations, nr, 4, are, very, useful, since, they, are, permanently, charged, and, they, are, often, used, as, an, alternative, to, the, expensive, cs, to, stabilise, very, large, and, very, easily, polarisable, anions, such, as, hi, 2, 812, 9, tetraalkylammonium, hydroxides, like, alkali, metal, hydroxides, are, very, strong, bases, that, react, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, to, form, carbonates, 256, furthermore, the, nitrogen, atom, may, be, replaced, by, a, phosphorus, arsenic, or, antimony, atom, the, heavier, nonmetallic, pnictogens, creating, a, phosphonium, ph, 4, or, arsonium, ash, 4, cation, that, can, itself, be, substituted, similarly, while, stibonium, sbh, 4, itself, is, not, known, some, of, its, organic, derivatives, are, characterised, cobaltocene, co, c, 5, h, 5, 2, is, a, metallocene, the, cobalt, analogue, of, ferrocene, it, is, a, dark, purple, solid, cobaltocene, has, 19, valence, electrons, one, more, than, usually, found, in, organotransition, metal, complexes, such, as, its, very, stable, relative, ferrocene, in, accordance, with, the, 18, electron, rule, this, additional, electron, occupies, an, orbital, that, is, antibonding, with, respect, to, the, co, c, bonds, consequently, many, chemical, reactions, of, co, c, 5, h, 5, 2, are, characterized, by, its, tendency, to, lose, this, extra, electron, yielding, a, very, stable, 18, electron, cation, known, as, cobaltocenium, many, cobaltocenium, salts, coprecipitate, with, caesium, salts, and, cobaltocenium, hydroxide, is, a, strong, base, that, absorbs, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, to, form, cobaltocenium, carbonate, 256, like, the, alkali, metals, cobaltocene, is, a, strong, reducing, agent, and, decamethylcobaltocene, is, stronger, still, due, to, the, combined, inductive, effect, of, the, ten, methyl, groups, cobalt, may, be, substituted, by, its, heavier, congener, rhodium, to, give, rhodocene, an, even, stronger, reducing, agent, iridocene, involving, iridium, would, presumably, be, still, more, potent, but, is, not, very, well, studied, due, to, its, instability, thallium, is, the, heaviest, stable, element, in, group, 13, of, the, periodic, table, at, the, bottom, of, the, periodic, table, the, inert, pair, effect, is, quite, strong, because, of, the, relativistic, stabilisation, of, the, 6s, orbital, and, the, decreasing, bond, energy, as, the, atoms, increase, in, size, so, that, the, amount, of, energy, released, in, forming, two, more, bonds, is, not, worth, the, high, ionisation, energies, of, the, 6s, electrons, 226, 7, it, displays, the, 1, oxidation, state, 28, that, all, the, known, alkali, metals, display, 28, and, thallium, compounds, with, thallium, in, its, 1, oxidation, state, closely, resemble, the, corresponding, potassium, or, silver, compounds, stoichiometrically, due, to, the, similar, ionic, radii, of, the, tl, 164, pm, k, 152, pm, and, ag, 129, pm, ions, it, was, sometimes, considered, an, alkali, metal, in, continental, europe, but, not, in, england, in, the, years, immediately, following, its, discovery, 126, and, was, placed, just, after, caesium, as, the, sixth, alkali, metal, in, dmitri, mendeleev, s, 1869, periodic, table, and, julius, lothar, meyer, s, 1868, periodic, table, mendeleev, s, 1871, periodic, table, and, meyer, s, 1870, periodic, table, put, thallium, in, its, current, position, in, the, boron, group, and, left, the, space, below, caesium, blank, however, thallium, also, displays, the, oxidation, state, 3, 28, which, no, known, alkali, metal, displays, 28, although, ununennium, the, undiscovered, seventh, alkali, metal, is, predicted, to, possibly, display, the, 3, oxidation, state, 1729, 1730, the, sixth, alkali, metal, is, now, considered, to, be, francium, while, tl, is, stabilised, by, the, inert, pair, effect, this, inert, pair, of, 6s, electrons, is, still, able, to, participate, chemically, so, that, these, electrons, are, stereochemically, active, in, aqueous, solution, additionally, the, thallium, halides, except, tlf, are, quite, insoluble, in, water, and, tli, has, an, unusual, structure, because, of, the, presence, of, the, stereochemically, active, inert, pair, in, thallium, the, group, 11, metals, or, coinage, metals, copper, silver, and, gold, are, typically, categorised, as, transition, metals, given, they, can, form, ions, with, incomplete, d, shells, physically, they, have, the, relatively, low, melting, points, and, high, electronegativity, values, associated, with, post, transition, metals, the, filled, d, subshell, and, free, s, electron, of, cu, ag, and, au, contribute, to, their, high, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, transition, metals, to, the, left, of, group, 11, experience, interactions, between, s, electrons, and, the, partially, filled, d, subshell, that, lower, electron, mobility, chemically, the, group, 11, metals, behave, like, main, group, metals, in, their, 1, valence, states, and, are, hence, somewhat, related, to, the, alkali, metals, this, is, one, reason, for, their, previously, being, labelled, as, group, ib, paralleling, the, alkali, metals, group, ia, they, are, occasionally, classified, as, post, transition, metals, their, spectra, are, analogous, to, those, of, the, alkali, metals, their, monopositive, ions, are, paramagnetic, and, contribute, no, colour, to, their, salts, like, those, of, the, alkali, metals, in, mendeleev, s, 1871, periodic, table, copper, silver, and, gold, are, listed, twice, once, under, group, viii, with, the, iron, triad, and, platinum, group, metals, and, once, under, group, ib, group, ib, was, nonetheless, parenthesised, to, note, that, it, was, tentative, mendeleev, s, main, criterion, for, group, assignment, was, the, maximum, oxidation, state, of, an, element, on, that, basis, the, group, 11, elements, could, not, be, classified, in, group, ib, due, to, the, existence, of, copper, ii, and, gold, iii, compounds, being, known, at, that, time, however, eliminating, group, ib, would, make, group, i, the, only, main, group, group, viii, was, labelled, a, transition, group, to, lack, an, a, b, bifurcation, soon, afterward, a, majority, of, chemists, chose, to, classify, these, elements, in, group, ib, and, remove, them, from, group, viii, for, the, resulting, symmetry, this, was, the, predominant, classification, until, the, rise, of, the, modern, medium, long, 18, column, periodic, table, which, separated, the, alkali, metals, and, group, 11, metals, the, coinage, metals, were, traditionally, regarded, as, a, subdivision, of, the, alkali, metal, group, due, to, them, sharing, the, characteristic, s, 1, electron, configuration, of, the, alkali, metals, group, 1, p, 6, s, 1, group, 11, d, 10, s, 1, however, the, similarities, are, largely, confined, to, the, stoichiometries, of, the, 1, compounds, of, both, groups, and, not, their, chemical, properties, 1177, this, stems, from, the, filled, d, subshell, providing, a, much, weaker, shielding, effect, on, the, outermost, s, electron, than, the, filled, p, subshell, so, that, the, coinage, metals, have, much, higher, first, ionisation, energies, and, smaller, ionic, radii, than, do, the, corresponding, alkali, metals, 1177, furthermore, they, have, higher, melting, points, hardnesses, and, densities, and, lower, reactivities, and, solubilities, in, liquid, ammonia, as, well, as, having, more, covalent, character, in, their, compounds, 1177, finally, the, alkali, metals, are, at, the, top, of, the, electrochemical, series, whereas, the, coinage, metals, are, almost, at, the, very, bottom, 1177, the, coinage, metals, filled, d, shell, is, much, more, easily, disrupted, than, the, alkali, metals, filled, p, shell, so, that, the, second, and, third, ionisation, energies, are, lower, enabling, higher, oxidation, states, than, 1, and, a, richer, coordination, chemistry, thus, giving, the, group, 11, metals, clear, transition, metal, character, 1177, particularly, noteworthy, is, gold, forming, ionic, compounds, with, rubidium, and, caesium, in, which, it, forms, the, auride, ion, au, which, also, occurs, in, solvated, form, in, liquid, ammonia, solution, here, gold, behaves, as, a, pseudohalogen, because, its, 5d, 10, 6s, 1, configuration, has, one, electron, less, than, the, quasi, closed, shell, 5d, 10, 6s, 2, configuration, of, mercury, 1177, the, production, of, pure, alkali, metals, is, somewhat, complicated, due, to, their, extreme, reactivity, with, commonly, used, substances, such, as, water, from, their, silicate, ores, all, the, stable, alkali, metals, may, be, obtained, the, same, way, sulfuric, acid, is, first, used, to, dissolve, the, desired, alkali, metal, ion, and, aluminium, iii, ions, from, the, ore, leaching, whereupon, basic, precipitation, removes, aluminium, ions, from, the, mixture, by, precipitating, it, as, the, hydroxide, the, remaining, insoluble, alkali, metal, carbonate, is, then, precipitated, selectively, the, salt, is, then, dissolved, in, hydrochloric, acid, to, produce, the, chloride, the, result, is, then, left, to, evaporate, and, the, alkali, metal, can, then, be, isolated, lithium, and, sodium, are, typically, isolated, through, electrolysis, from, their, liquid, chlorides, with, calcium, chloride, typically, added, to, lower, the, melting, point, of, the, mixture, the, heavier, alkali, metals, however, are, more, typically, isolated, in, a, different, way, where, a, reducing, agent, typically, sodium, for, potassium, and, magnesium, or, calcium, for, the, heaviest, alkali, metals, is, used, to, reduce, the, alkali, metal, chloride, the, liquid, or, gaseous, product, the, alkali, metal, then, undergoes, fractional, distillation, for, purification, most, routes, to, the, pure, alkali, metals, require, the, use, of, electrolysis, due, to, their, high, reactivity, one, of, the, few, which, does, not, is, the, pyrolysis, of, the, corresponding, alkali, metal, azide, which, yields, the, metal, for, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, and, the, nitride, for, lithium, 77, lithium, salts, have, to, be, extracted, from, the, water, of, mineral, springs, brine, pools, and, brine, deposits, the, metal, is, produced, electrolytically, from, a, mixture, of, fused, lithium, chloride, and, potassium, chloride, sodium, occurs, mostly, in, seawater, and, dried, seabed, but, is, now, produced, through, electrolysis, of, sodium, chloride, by, lowering, the, melting, point, of, the, substance, to, below, 700, c, through, the, use, of, a, downs, cell, extremely, pure, sodium, can, be, produced, through, the, thermal, decomposition, of, sodium, azide, potassium, occurs, in, many, minerals, such, as, sylvite, potassium, chloride, previously, potassium, was, generally, made, from, the, electrolysis, of, potassium, chloride, or, potassium, hydroxide, found, extensively, in, places, such, as, canada, russia, belarus, germany, israel, united, states, and, jordan, in, a, method, similar, to, how, sodium, was, produced, in, the, late, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, it, can, also, be, produced, from, seawater, however, these, methods, are, problematic, because, the, potassium, metal, tends, to, dissolve, in, its, molten, chloride, and, vaporises, significantly, at, the, operating, temperatures, potentially, forming, the, explosive, superoxide, as, a, result, pure, potassium, metal, is, now, produced, by, reducing, molten, potassium, chloride, with, sodium, metal, at, 850, c, 74, although, sodium, is, less, reactive, than, potassium, this, process, works, because, at, such, high, temperatures, potassium, is, more, volatile, than, sodium, and, can, easily, be, distilled, off, so, that, the, equilibrium, shifts, towards, the, right, to, produce, more, potassium, gas, and, proceeds, almost, to, completion, 74, metals, like, sodium, are, obtained, by, electrolysis, of, molten, salts, rb, cs, obtained, mainly, as, by, products, of, li, processing, to, make, pure, caesium, ores, of, caesium, and, rubidium, are, crushed, and, heated, to, 650, c, with, sodium, metal, generating, an, alloy, that, can, then, be, separated, via, a, fractional, distillation, technique, because, metallic, caesium, is, too, reactive, to, handle, it, is, normally, offered, as, caesium, azide, csn3, caesium, hydroxide, is, formed, when, caesium, interacts, aggressively, with, water, and, ice, csoh, rubidium, is, the, 16th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, however, it, is, quite, rare, some, minerals, found, in, north, america, south, africa, russia, and, canada, contain, rubidium, some, potassium, minerals, lepidolites, biotites, feldspar, carnallite, contain, it, together, with, caesium, pollucite, carnallite, leucite, and, lepidolite, are, all, minerals, that, contain, rubidium, as, a, by, product, of, lithium, extraction, it, is, commercially, obtained, from, lepidolite, rubidium, is, also, found, in, potassium, rocks, and, brines, which, is, a, commercial, supply, the, majority, of, rubidium, is, now, obtained, as, a, byproduct, of, refining, lithium, rubidium, is, used, in, vacuum, tubes, as, a, getter, a, material, that, combines, with, and, removes, trace, gases, from, vacuum, tubes, for, several, years, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, a, by, product, of, the, potassium, production, called, alkarb, was, a, main, source, for, rubidium, alkarb, contained, 21, rubidium, while, the, rest, was, potassium, and, a, small, fraction, of, caesium, today, the, largest, producers, of, caesium, for, example, the, tanco, mine, in, manitoba, canada, produce, rubidium, as, by, product, from, pollucite, today, a, common, method, for, separating, rubidium, from, potassium, and, caesium, is, the, fractional, crystallisation, of, a, rubidium, and, caesium, alum, cs, rb, al, so, 4, 2, 12, h, 2, o, which, yields, pure, rubidium, alum, after, approximately, 30, recrystallisations, the, limited, applications, and, the, lack, of, a, mineral, rich, in, rubidium, limit, the, production, of, rubidium, compounds, to, 2, to, 4, tonnes, per, year, caesium, however, is, not, produced, from, the, above, reaction, instead, the, mining, of, pollucite, ore, is, the, main, method, of, obtaining, pure, caesium, extracted, from, the, ore, mainly, by, three, methods, acid, digestion, alkaline, decomposition, and, direct, reduction, both, metals, are, produced, as, by, products, of, lithium, production, after, 1958, when, interest, in, lithium, s, thermonuclear, properties, increased, sharply, the, production, of, rubidium, and, caesium, also, increased, correspondingly, 71, pure, rubidium, and, caesium, metals, are, produced, by, reducing, their, chlorides, with, calcium, metal, at, 750, c, and, low, pressure, 74, as, a, result, of, its, extreme, rarity, in, nature, most, francium, is, synthesised, in, the, nuclear, reaction, 197, au, 18, o, 210, fr, 5, n, yielding, francium, 209, francium, 210, and, francium, 211, the, greatest, quantity, of, francium, ever, assembled, to, date, is, about, 300, 000, neutral, atoms, which, were, synthesised, using, the, nuclear, reaction, given, above, when, the, only, natural, isotope, francium, 223, is, specifically, required, it, is, produced, as, the, alpha, daughter, of, actinium, 227, itself, produced, synthetically, from, the, neutron, irradiation, of, natural, radium, 226, one, of, the, daughters, of, natural, uranium, 238, lithium, sodium, and, potassium, have, many, useful, applications, while, rubidium, and, caesium, are, very, notable, in, academic, contexts, but, do, not, have, many, applications, yet, 68, lithium, is, the, key, ingredient, for, a, range, of, lithium, based, batteries, and, lithium, oxide, can, help, process, silica, lithium, stearate, is, a, thickener, and, can, be, used, to, make, lubricating, greases, it, is, produced, from, lithium, hydroxide, which, is, also, used, to, absorb, carbon, dioxide, in, space, capsules, and, submarines, 70, lithium, chloride, is, used, as, a, brazing, alloy, for, aluminium, parts, in, medicine, some, lithium, salts, are, used, as, mood, stabilising, phamaceuticals, metallic, lithium, is, used, in, alloys, with, magnesium, and, aluminium, to, give, very, tough, and, light, alloys, 70, sodium, compounds, have, many, applications, the, most, well, known, being, sodium, chloride, as, table, salt, sodium, salts, of, fatty, acids, are, used, as, soap, pure, sodium, metal, also, has, many, applications, including, use, in, sodium, vapour, lamps, which, produce, very, efficient, light, compared, to, other, types, of, lighting, and, can, help, smooth, the, surface, of, other, metals, being, a, strong, reducing, agent, it, is, often, used, to, reduce, many, other, metals, such, as, titanium, and, zirconium, from, their, chlorides, furthermore, it, is, very, useful, as, a, heat, exchange, liquid, in, fast, breeder, nuclear, reactors, due, to, its, low, melting, point, viscosity, and, cross, section, towards, neutron, absorption, 74, sodium, ion, batteries, may, provide, cheaper, alternatives, to, their, equivalent, lithium, based, cells, both, sodium, and, potassium, are, commonly, used, as, gras, counterions, to, create, more, water, soluble, and, hence, more, bioavailable, salt, forms, of, acidic, pharmaceuticals, potassium, compounds, are, often, used, as, fertilisers, 73, as, potassium, is, an, important, element, for, plant, nutrition, potassium, hydroxide, is, a, very, strong, base, and, is, used, to, control, the, ph, of, various, substances, potassium, nitrate, and, potassium, permanganate, are, often, used, as, powerful, oxidising, agents, 73, potassium, superoxide, is, used, in, breathing, masks, as, it, reacts, with, carbon, dioxide, to, give, potassium, carbonate, and, oxygen, gas, pure, potassium, metal, is, not, often, used, but, its, alloys, with, sodium, may, substitute, for, pure, sodium, in, fast, breeder, nuclear, reactors, 74, rubidium, and, caesium, are, often, used, in, atomic, clocks, caesium, atomic, clocks, are, extraordinarily, accurate, if, a, clock, had, been, made, at, the, time, of, the, dinosaurs, it, would, be, off, by, less, than, four, seconds, after, 80, million, years, for, that, reason, caesium, atoms, are, used, as, the, definition, of, the, second, rubidium, ions, are, often, used, in, purple, fireworks, and, caesium, is, often, used, in, drilling, fluids, in, the, petroleum, industry, francium, has, no, commercial, applications, but, because, of, francium, s, relatively, simple, atomic, structure, among, other, things, it, has, been, used, in, spectroscopy, experiments, leading, to, more, information, regarding, energy, levels, and, the, coupling, constants, between, subatomic, particles, studies, on, the, light, emitted, by, laser, trapped, francium, 210, ions, have, provided, accurate, data, on, transitions, between, atomic, energy, levels, similar, to, those, predicted, by, quantum, theory, pure, alkali, metals, are, dangerously, reactive, with, air, and, water, and, must, be, kept, away, from, heat, fire, oxidising, agents, acids, most, organic, compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and, moisture, they, also, react, with, carbon, dioxide, and, carbon, tetrachloride, so, that, normal, fire, extinguishers, are, counterproductive, when, used, on, alkali, metal, fires, some, class, d, dry, powder, extinguishers, designed, for, metal, fires, are, effective, depriving, the, fire, of, oxygen, and, cooling, the, alkali, metal, experiments, are, usually, conducted, using, only, small, quantities, of, a, few, grams, in, a, fume, hood, small, quantities, of, lithium, may, be, disposed, of, by, reaction, with, cool, water, but, the, heavier, alkali, metals, should, be, dissolved, in, the, less, reactive, isopropanol, the, alkali, metals, must, be, stored, under, mineral, oil, or, an, inert, atmosphere, the, inert, atmosphere, used, may, be, argon, or, nitrogen, gas, except, for, lithium, which, reacts, with, nitrogen, rubidium, and, caesium, must, be, kept, away, from, air, even, under, oil, because, even, a, small, amount, of, air, diffused, into, the, oil, may, trigger, formation, of, the, dangerously, explosive, peroxide, for, the, same, reason, potassium, should, not, be, stored, under, oil, in, an, oxygen, containing, atmosphere, for, longer, than, 6, months, the, bioinorganic, chemistry, of, the, alkali, metal, ions, has, been, extensively, reviewed, solid, state, crystal, structures, have, been, determined, for, many, complexes, of, alkali, metal, ions, in, small, peptides, nucleic, acid, constituents, carbohydrates, and, ionophore, complexes, lithium, naturally, only, occurs, in, traces, in, biological, systems, and, has, no, known, biological, role, but, does, have, effects, on, the, body, when, ingested, lithium, carbonate, is, used, as, a, mood, stabiliser, in, psychiatry, to, treat, bipolar, disorder, manic, depression, in, daily, doses, of, about, 0, 5, to, 2, grams, although, there, are, side, effects, excessive, ingestion, of, lithium, causes, drowsiness, slurred, speech, and, vomiting, among, other, symptoms, and, poisons, the, central, nervous, system, which, is, dangerous, as, the, required, dosage, of, lithium, to, treat, bipolar, disorder, is, only, slightly, lower, than, the, toxic, dosage, its, biochemistry, the, way, it, is, handled, by, the, human, body, and, studies, using, rats, and, goats, suggest, that, it, is, an, essential, trace, element, although, the, natural, biological, function, of, lithium, in, humans, has, yet, to, be, identified, sodium, and, potassium, occur, in, all, known, biological, systems, generally, functioning, as, electrolytes, inside, and, outside, cells, sodium, is, an, essential, nutrient, that, regulates, blood, volume, blood, pressure, osmotic, equilibrium, and, ph, the, minimum, physiological, requirement, for, sodium, is, 500, milligrams, per, day, sodium, chloride, also, known, as, common, salt, is, the, principal, source, of, sodium, in, the, diet, and, is, used, as, seasoning, and, preservative, such, as, for, pickling, and, jerky, most, of, it, comes, from, processed, foods, the, dietary, reference, intake, for, sodium, is, 1, 5, grams, per, day, but, most, people, in, the, united, states, consume, more, than, 2, 3, grams, per, day, the, minimum, amount, that, promotes, hypertension, this, in, turn, causes, 7, 6, million, premature, deaths, worldwide, potassium, is, the, major, cation, positive, ion, inside, animal, cells, while, sodium, is, the, major, cation, outside, animal, cells, the, concentration, differences, of, these, charged, particles, causes, a, difference, in, electric, potential, between, the, inside, and, outside, of, cells, known, as, the, membrane, potential, the, balance, between, potassium, and, sodium, is, maintained, by, ion, transporter, proteins, in, the, cell, membrane, the, cell, membrane, potential, created, by, potassium, and, sodium, ions, allows, the, cell, to, generate, an, action, potential, a, spike, of, electrical, discharge, the, ability, of, cells, to, produce, electrical, discharge, is, critical, for, body, functions, such, as, neurotransmission, muscle, contraction, and, heart, function, disruption, of, this, balance, may, thus, be, fatal, for, example, ingestion, of, large, amounts, of, potassium, compounds, can, lead, to, hyperkalemia, strongly, influencing, the, cardiovascular, system, potassium, chloride, is, used, in, the, united, states, for, lethal, injection, executions, due, to, their, similar, atomic, radii, rubidium, and, caesium, in, the, body, mimic, potassium, and, are, taken, up, similarly, rubidium, has, no, known, biological, role, but, may, help, stimulate, metabolism, and, similarly, to, caesium, replace, potassium, in, the, body, causing, potassium, deficiency, partial, substitution, is, quite, possible, and, rather, non, toxic, a, 70, kg, person, contains, on, average, 0, 36, g, of, rubidium, and, an, increase, in, this, value, by, 50, to, 100, times, did, not, show, negative, effects, in, test, persons, rats, can, survive, up, to, 50, substitution, of, potassium, by, rubidium, rubidium, and, to, a, much, lesser, extent, caesium, can, function, as, temporary, cures, for, hypokalemia, while, rubidium, can, adequately, physiologically, substitute, potassium, in, some, systems, caesium, is, never, able, to, do, so, there, is, only, very, limited, evidence, in, the, form, of, deficiency, symptoms, for, rubidium, being, possibly, essential, in, goats, even, if, this, is, true, the, trace, amounts, usually, present, in, food, are, more, than, enough, caesium, compounds, are, rarely, encountered, by, most, people, but, most, caesium, compounds, are, mildly, toxic, like, rubidium, caesium, tends, to, substitute, potassium, in, the, body, but, is, significantly, larger, and, is, therefore, a, poorer, substitute, excess, caesium, can, lead, to, hypokalemia, arrythmia, and, acute, cardiac, arrest, but, such, amounts, would, not, ordinarily, be, encountered, in, natural, sources, as, such, caesium, is, not, a, major, chemical, environmental, pollutant, the, median, lethal, dose, ld, 50, value, for, caesium, chloride, in, mice, is, 2, 3, g, per, kilogram, which, is, comparable, to, the, ld, 50, values, of, potassium, chloride, and, sodium, chloride, caesium, chloride, has, been, promoted, as, an, alternative, cancer, therapy, but, has, been, linked, to, the, deaths, of, over, 50, patients, on, whom, it, was, used, as, part, of, a, scientifically, unvalidated, cancer, treatment, radioisotopes, of, caesium, require, special, precautions, the, improper, handling, of, caesium, 137, gamma, ray, sources, can, lead, to, release, of, this, radioisotope, and, radiation, injuries, perhaps, the, best, known, case, is, the, goi, nia, accident, of, 1987, in, which, an, improperly, disposed, of, radiation, therapy, system, from, an, abandoned, clinic, in, the, city, of, goi, nia, brazil, was, scavenged, from, a, junkyard, and, the, glowing, caesium, salt, sold, to, curious, uneducated, buyers, this, led, to, four, deaths, and, serious, injuries, from, radiation, exposure, together, with, caesium, 134, iodine, 131, and, strontium, 90, caesium, 137, was, among, the, isotopes, distributed, by, the, chernobyl, disaster, which, constitute, the, greatest, risk, to, health, radioisotopes, of, francium, would, presumably, be, dangerous, as, well, due, to, their, high, decay, energy, and, short, half, life, but, none, have, been, produced, in, large, enough, amounts, to, pose, any, serious, risk, lithium,
