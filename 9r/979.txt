friction, is, the, force, resisting, the, relative, motion, of, solid, surfaces, fluid, layers, and, material, elements, sliding, against, each, other, types, of, friction, include, dry, fluid, lubricated, skin, and, internal, an, incomplete, list, the, study, of, the, processes, involved, is, called, tribology, and, has, a, history, of, more, than, 2000, years, friction, can, have, dramatic, consequences, as, illustrated, by, the, use, of, friction, created, by, rubbing, pieces, of, wood, together, to, start, a, fire, another, important, consequence, of, many, types, of, friction, can, be, wear, which, may, lead, to, performance, degradation, or, damage, to, components, it, is, known, that, frictional, energy, losses, account, for, about, 20, of, the, total, energy, expenditure, of, the, world, as, briefly, discussed, later, there, are, many, different, contributors, to, the, retarding, force, in, friction, ranging, from, asperity, deformation, to, the, generation, of, charges, and, changes, in, local, structure, friction, is, not, itself, a, fundamental, force, it, is, a, non, conservative, force, work, done, against, friction, is, path, dependent, in, the, presence, of, friction, some, kinetic, or, mechanical, energy, is, transformed, to, thermal, energy, as, well, as, the, free, energy, of, the, structural, changes, and, other, types, of, dissipation, so, mechanical, energy, is, not, conserved, the, complexity, of, the, interactions, involved, makes, the, calculation, of, friction, from, first, principles, difficult, and, it, is, often, easier, to, use, empirical, methods, for, analysis, and, the, development, of, theory, there, are, several, types, of, friction, many, ancient, authors, including, aristotle, vitruvius, and, pliny, the, elder, were, interested, in, the, cause, and, mitigation, of, friction, they, were, aware, of, differences, between, static, and, kinetic, friction, with, themistius, stating, in, 350, a, d, that, it, is, easier, to, further, the, motion, of, a, moving, body, than, to, move, a, body, at, rest, the, classic, laws, of, sliding, friction, were, discovered, by, leonardo, da, vinci, in, 1493, a, pioneer, in, tribology, but, the, laws, documented, in, his, notebooks, were, not, published, and, remained, unknown, these, laws, were, rediscovered, by, guillaume, amontons, in, 1699, and, became, known, as, amonton, s, three, laws, of, dry, friction, amontons, presented, the, nature, of, friction, in, terms, of, surface, irregularities, and, the, force, required, to, raise, the, weight, pressing, the, surfaces, together, this, view, was, further, elaborated, by, bernard, forest, de, b, lidor, and, leonhard, euler, 1750, who, derived, the, angle, of, repose, of, a, weight, on, an, inclined, plane, and, first, distinguished, between, static, and, kinetic, friction, john, theophilus, desaguliers, 1734, first, recognized, the, role, of, adhesion, in, friction, microscopic, forces, cause, surfaces, to, stick, together, he, proposed, that, friction, was, the, force, necessary, to, tear, the, adhering, surfaces, apart, the, understanding, of, friction, was, further, developed, by, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, 1785, coulomb, investigated, the, influence, of, four, main, factors, on, friction, the, nature, of, the, materials, in, contact, and, their, surface, coatings, the, extent, of, the, surface, area, the, normal, pressure, or, load, and, the, length, of, time, that, the, surfaces, remained, in, contact, time, of, repose, coulomb, further, considered, the, influence, of, sliding, velocity, temperature, and, humidity, in, order, to, decide, between, the, different, explanations, on, the, nature, of, friction, that, had, been, proposed, the, distinction, between, static, and, dynamic, friction, is, made, in, coulomb, s, friction, law, see, below, although, this, distinction, was, already, drawn, by, johann, andreas, von, segner, in, 1758, the, effect, of, the, time, of, repose, was, explained, by, pieter, van, musschenbroek, 1762, by, considering, the, surfaces, of, fibrous, materials, with, fibers, meshing, together, which, takes, a, finite, time, in, which, the, friction, increases, john, leslie, 1766, 1832, noted, a, weakness, in, the, views, of, amontons, and, coulomb, if, friction, arises, from, a, weight, being, drawn, up, the, inclined, plane, of, successive, asperities, why, then, isn, t, it, balanced, through, descending, the, opposite, slope, leslie, was, equally, skeptical, about, the, role, of, adhesion, proposed, by, desaguliers, which, should, on, the, whole, have, the, same, tendency, to, accelerate, as, to, retard, the, motion, in, leslie, s, view, friction, should, be, seen, as, a, time, dependent, process, of, flattening, pressing, down, asperities, which, creates, new, obstacles, in, what, were, cavities, before, in, the, long, course, of, the, development, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, and, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, friction, was, recognised, as, a, mode, of, conversion, of, mechanical, work, into, heat, in, 1798, benjamin, thompson, reported, on, cannon, boring, experiments, arthur, jules, morin, 1833, developed, the, concept, of, sliding, versus, rolling, friction, in, 1842, julius, robert, mayer, frictionally, generated, heat, in, paper, pulp, and, measured, the, temperature, rise, in, 1845, joule, published, a, paper, entitled, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, in, which, he, specified, a, numerical, value, for, the, amount, of, mechanical, work, required, to, produce, a, unit, of, heat, based, on, the, friction, of, an, electric, current, passing, through, a, resistor, and, on, the, friction, of, a, paddle, wheel, rotating, in, a, vat, of, water, osborne, reynolds, 1866, derived, the, equation, of, viscous, flow, this, completed, the, classic, empirical, model, of, friction, static, kinetic, and, fluid, commonly, used, today, in, engineering, in, 1877, fleeming, jenkin, and, j, a, ewing, investigated, the, continuity, between, static, and, kinetic, friction, in, 1907, g, h, bryan, published, an, investigation, of, the, foundations, of, thermodynamics, thermodynamics, an, introductory, treatise, dealing, mainly, with, first, principles, and, their, direct, applications, he, noted, that, for, a, driven, hard, surface, sliding, on, a, body, driven, by, it, the, work, done, by, the, driver, exceeds, the, work, received, by, the, body, the, difference, is, accounted, for, by, heat, generated, by, friction, over, the, years, for, example, in, his, 1879, thesis, but, particularly, in, 1926, planck, advocated, regarding, the, generation, of, heat, by, rubbing, as, the, most, specific, way, to, define, heat, and, the, prime, example, of, an, irreversible, thermodynamic, process, the, focus, of, research, during, the, 20th, century, has, been, to, understand, the, physical, mechanisms, behind, friction, frank, philip, bowden, and, david, tabor, 1950, showed, that, at, a, microscopic, level, the, actual, area, of, contact, between, surfaces, is, a, very, small, fraction, of, the, apparent, area, this, actual, area, of, contact, caused, by, asperities, increases, with, pressure, the, development, of, the, atomic, force, microscope, ca, 1986, enabled, scientists, to, study, friction, at, the, atomic, scale, showing, that, on, that, scale, dry, friction, is, the, product, of, the, inter, surface, shear, stress, and, the, contact, area, these, two, discoveries, explain, amonton, s, first, law, below, the, macroscopic, proportionality, between, normal, force, and, static, frictional, force, between, dry, surfaces, the, elementary, property, of, sliding, kinetic, friction, were, discovered, by, experiment, in, the, 15th, to, 18th, centuries, and, were, expressed, as, three, empirical, laws, dry, friction, resists, relative, lateral, motion, of, two, solid, surfaces, in, contact, the, two, regimes, of, dry, friction, are, static, friction, stiction, between, non, moving, surfaces, and, kinetic, friction, sometimes, called, sliding, friction, or, dynamic, friction, between, moving, surfaces, coulomb, friction, named, after, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, is, an, approximate, model, used, to, calculate, the, force, of, dry, friction, it, is, governed, by, the, model, f, f, f, n, displaystyle, f, mathrm, f, leq, mu, f, mathrm, n, where, the, coulomb, friction, f, f, displaystyle, f, mathrm, f, may, take, any, value, from, zero, up, to, f, n, displaystyle, mu, f, mathrm, n, and, the, direction, of, the, frictional, force, against, a, surface, is, opposite, to, the, motion, that, surface, would, experience, in, the, absence, of, friction, thus, in, the, static, case, the, frictional, force, is, exactly, what, it, must, be, in, order, to, prevent, motion, between, the, surfaces, it, balances, the, net, force, tending, to, cause, such, motion, in, this, case, rather, than, providing, an, estimate, of, the, actual, frictional, force, the, coulomb, approximation, provides, a, threshold, value, for, this, force, above, which, motion, would, commence, this, maximum, force, is, known, as, traction, the, force, of, friction, is, always, exerted, in, a, direction, that, opposes, movement, for, kinetic, friction, or, potential, movement, for, static, friction, between, the, two, surfaces, for, example, a, curling, stone, sliding, along, the, ice, experiences, a, kinetic, force, slowing, it, down, for, an, example, of, potential, movement, the, drive, wheels, of, an, accelerating, car, experience, a, frictional, force, pointing, forward, if, they, did, not, the, wheels, would, spin, and, the, rubber, would, slide, backwards, along, the, pavement, note, that, it, is, not, the, direction, of, movement, of, the, vehicle, they, oppose, it, is, the, direction, of, potential, sliding, between, tire, and, road, the, normal, force, is, defined, as, the, net, force, compressing, two, parallel, surfaces, together, and, its, direction, is, perpendicular, to, the, surfaces, in, the, simple, case, of, a, mass, resting, on, a, horizontal, surface, the, only, component, of, the, normal, force, is, the, force, due, to, gravity, where, n, m, g, displaystyle, n, mg, in, this, case, conditions, of, equilibrium, tell, us, that, the, magnitude, of, the, friction, force, is, zero, f, f, 0, displaystyle, f, f, 0, in, fact, the, friction, force, always, satisfies, f, f, n, displaystyle, f, f, leq, mu, n, with, equality, reached, only, at, a, critical, ramp, angle, given, by, tan, 1, displaystyle, tan, 1, mu, that, is, steep, enough, to, initiate, sliding, the, friction, coefficient, is, an, empirical, experimentally, measured, structural, property, that, depends, only, on, various, aspects, of, the, contacting, materials, such, as, surface, roughness, the, coefficient, of, friction, is, not, a, function, of, mass, or, volume, for, instance, a, large, aluminum, block, has, the, same, coefficient, of, friction, as, a, small, aluminum, block, however, the, magnitude, of, the, friction, force, itself, depends, on, the, normal, force, and, hence, on, the, mass, of, the, block, depending, on, the, situation, the, calculation, of, the, normal, force, n, displaystyle, n, might, include, forces, other, than, gravity, if, an, object, is, on, a, level, surface, and, subjected, to, an, external, force, p, displaystyle, p, tending, to, cause, it, to, slide, then, the, normal, force, between, the, object, and, the, surface, is, just, n, m, g, p, y, displaystyle, n, mg, p, y, where, m, g, displaystyle, mg, is, the, block, s, weight, and, p, y, displaystyle, p, y, is, the, downward, component, of, the, external, force, prior, to, sliding, this, friction, force, is, f, f, p, x, displaystyle, f, f, p, x, where, p, x, displaystyle, p, x, is, the, horizontal, component, of, the, external, force, thus, f, f, n, displaystyle, f, f, leq, mu, n, in, general, sliding, commences, only, after, this, frictional, force, reaches, the, value, f, f, n, displaystyle, f, f, mu, n, until, then, friction, is, whatever, it, needs, to, be, to, provide, equilibrium, so, it, can, be, treated, as, simply, a, reaction, if, the, object, is, on, a, tilted, surface, such, as, an, inclined, plane, the, normal, force, from, gravity, is, smaller, than, m, g, displaystyle, mg, because, less, of, the, force, of, gravity, is, perpendicular, to, the, face, of, the, plane, the, normal, force, and, the, frictional, force, are, ultimately, determined, using, vector, analysis, usually, via, a, free, body, diagram, in, general, process, for, solving, any, statics, problem, with, friction, is, to, treat, contacting, surfaces, tentatively, as, immovable, so, that, the, corresponding, tangential, reaction, force, between, them, can, be, calculated, if, this, frictional, reaction, force, satisfies, f, f, n, displaystyle, f, f, leq, mu, n, then, the, tentative, assumption, was, correct, and, it, is, the, actual, frictional, force, otherwise, the, friction, force, must, be, set, equal, to, f, f, n, displaystyle, f, f, mu, n, and, then, the, resulting, force, imbalance, would, then, determine, the, acceleration, associated, with, slipping, the, coefficient, of, friction, cof, often, symbolized, by, the, greek, letter, is, a, dimensionless, scalar, value, which, equals, the, ratio, of, the, force, of, friction, between, two, bodies, and, the, force, pressing, them, together, either, during, or, at, the, onset, of, slipping, the, coefficient, of, friction, depends, on, the, materials, used, for, example, ice, on, steel, has, a, low, coefficient, of, friction, while, rubber, on, pavement, has, a, high, coefficient, of, friction, coefficients, of, friction, range, from, near, zero, to, greater, than, one, the, coefficient, of, friction, between, two, surfaces, of, similar, metals, is, greater, than, that, between, two, surfaces, of, different, metals, for, example, brass, has, a, higher, coefficient, of, friction, when, moved, against, brass, but, less, if, moved, against, steel, or, aluminum, for, surfaces, at, rest, relative, to, each, other, s, displaystyle, mu, mu, mathrm, s, where, s, displaystyle, mu, mathrm, s, is, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, this, is, usually, larger, than, its, kinetic, counterpart, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, exhibited, by, a, pair, of, contacting, surfaces, depends, upon, the, combined, effects, of, material, deformation, characteristics, and, surface, roughness, both, of, which, have, their, origins, in, the, chemical, bonding, between, atoms, in, each, of, the, bulk, materials, and, between, the, material, surfaces, and, any, adsorbed, material, the, fractality, of, surfaces, a, parameter, describing, the, scaling, behavior, of, surface, asperities, is, known, to, play, an, important, role, in, determining, the, magnitude, of, the, static, friction, for, surfaces, in, relative, motion, k, displaystyle, mu, mu, mathrm, k, where, k, displaystyle, mu, mathrm, k, is, the, coefficient, of, kinetic, friction, the, coulomb, friction, is, equal, to, f, f, displaystyle, f, mathrm, f, and, the, frictional, force, on, each, surface, is, exerted, in, the, direction, opposite, to, its, motion, relative, to, the, other, surface, arthur, morin, introduced, the, term, and, demonstrated, the, utility, of, the, coefficient, of, friction, the, coefficient, of, friction, is, an, empirical, measurement, it, has, to, be, measured, experimentally, and, cannot, be, found, through, calculations, rougher, surfaces, tend, to, have, higher, effective, values, both, static, and, kinetic, coefficients, of, friction, depend, on, the, pair, of, surfaces, in, contact, for, a, given, pair, of, surfaces, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, is, usually, larger, than, that, of, kinetic, friction, in, some, sets, the, two, coefficients, are, equal, such, as, teflon, on, teflon, most, dry, materials, in, combination, have, friction, coefficient, values, between, 0, 3, and, 0, 6, values, outside, this, range, are, rarer, but, teflon, for, example, can, have, a, coefficient, as, low, as, 0, 04, a, value, of, zero, would, mean, no, friction, at, all, an, elusive, property, rubber, in, contact, with, other, surfaces, can, yield, friction, coefficients, from, 1, to, 2, occasionally, it, is, maintained, that, is, always, 1, but, this, is, not, true, while, in, most, relevant, applications, 1, a, value, above, 1, merely, implies, that, the, force, required, to, slide, an, object, along, the, surface, is, greater, than, the, normal, force, of, the, surface, on, the, object, for, example, silicone, rubber, or, acrylic, rubber, coated, surfaces, have, a, coefficient, of, friction, that, can, be, substantially, larger, than, 1, while, it, is, often, stated, that, the, cof, is, a, material, property, it, is, better, categorized, as, a, system, property, unlike, true, material, properties, such, as, conductivity, dielectric, constant, yield, strength, the, cof, for, any, two, materials, depends, on, system, variables, like, temperature, velocity, atmosphere, and, also, what, are, now, popularly, described, as, aging, and, deaging, times, as, well, as, on, geometric, properties, of, the, interface, between, the, materials, namely, surface, structure, for, example, a, copper, pin, sliding, against, a, thick, copper, plate, can, have, a, cof, that, varies, from, 0, 6, at, low, speeds, metal, sliding, against, metal, to, below, 0, 2, at, high, speeds, when, the, copper, surface, begins, to, melt, due, to, frictional, heating, the, latter, speed, of, course, does, not, determine, the, cof, uniquely, if, the, pin, diameter, is, increased, so, that, the, frictional, heating, is, removed, rapidly, the, temperature, drops, the, pin, remains, solid, and, the, cof, rises, to, that, of, a, low, speed, test, in, systems, with, significant, non, uniform, stress, fields, because, local, slip, occurs, before, the, system, slides, the, macroscopic, coefficient, of, static, friction, depends, on, the, applied, load, system, size, or, shape, amontons, law, is, not, satisfied, macroscopically, under, certain, conditions, some, materials, have, very, low, friction, coefficients, an, example, is, highly, ordered, pyrolytic, graphite, which, can, have, a, friction, coefficient, below, 0, 01, this, ultralow, friction, regime, is, called, superlubricity, static, friction, is, friction, between, two, or, more, solid, objects, that, are, not, moving, relative, to, each, other, for, example, static, friction, can, prevent, an, object, from, sliding, down, a, sloped, surface, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, typically, denoted, as, s, is, usually, higher, than, the, coefficient, of, kinetic, friction, static, friction, is, considered, to, arise, as, the, result, of, surface, roughness, features, across, multiple, length, scales, at, solid, surfaces, these, features, known, as, asperities, are, present, down, to, nano, scale, dimensions, and, result, in, true, solid, to, solid, contact, existing, only, at, a, limited, number, of, points, accounting, for, only, a, fraction, of, the, apparent, or, nominal, contact, area, the, linearity, between, applied, load, and, true, contact, area, arising, from, asperity, deformation, gives, rise, to, the, linearity, between, static, frictional, force, and, normal, force, found, for, typical, amonton, coulomb, type, friction, the, static, friction, force, must, be, overcome, by, an, applied, force, before, an, object, can, move, the, maximum, possible, friction, force, between, two, surfaces, before, sliding, begins, is, the, product, of, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, and, the, normal, force, f, max, s, f, n, displaystyle, f, text, max, mu, mathrm, s, f, text, n, when, there, is, no, sliding, occurring, the, friction, force, can, have, any, value, from, zero, up, to, f, max, displaystyle, f, text, max, any, force, smaller, than, f, max, displaystyle, f, text, max, attempting, to, slide, one, surface, over, the, other, is, opposed, by, a, frictional, force, of, equal, magnitude, and, opposite, direction, any, force, larger, than, f, max, displaystyle, f, text, max, overcomes, the, force, of, static, friction, and, causes, sliding, to, occur, the, instant, sliding, occurs, static, friction, is, no, longer, applicable, the, friction, between, the, two, surfaces, is, then, called, kinetic, friction, however, an, apparent, static, friction, can, be, observed, even, in, the, case, when, the, true, static, friction, is, zero, an, example, of, static, friction, is, the, force, that, prevents, a, car, wheel, from, slipping, as, it, rolls, on, the, ground, even, though, the, wheel, is, in, motion, the, patch, of, the, tire, in, contact, with, the, ground, is, stationary, relative, to, the, ground, so, it, is, static, rather, than, kinetic, friction, upon, slipping, the, wheel, friction, changes, to, kinetic, friction, an, anti, lock, braking, system, operates, on, the, principle, of, allowing, a, locked, wheel, to, resume, rotating, so, that, the, car, maintains, static, friction, the, maximum, value, of, static, friction, when, motion, is, impending, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, limiting, friction, although, this, term, is, not, used, universally, kinetic, friction, also, known, as, dynamic, friction, or, sliding, friction, occurs, when, two, objects, are, moving, relative, to, each, other, and, rub, together, like, a, sled, on, the, ground, the, coefficient, of, kinetic, friction, is, typically, denoted, as, k, and, is, usually, less, than, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, for, the, same, materials, however, richard, feynman, comments, that, with, dry, metals, it, is, very, hard, to, show, any, difference, the, friction, force, between, two, surfaces, after, sliding, begins, is, the, product, of, the, coefficient, of, kinetic, friction, and, the, normal, force, f, k, k, f, n, displaystyle, f, k, mu, mathrm, k, f, n, this, is, responsible, for, the, coulomb, damping, of, an, oscillating, or, vibrating, system, new, models, are, beginning, to, show, how, kinetic, friction, can, be, greater, than, static, friction, in, many, other, cases, roughness, effects, are, dominant, for, example, in, rubber, to, road, friction, surface, roughness, and, contact, area, affect, kinetic, friction, for, micro, and, nano, scale, objects, where, surface, area, forces, dominate, inertial, forces, the, origin, of, kinetic, friction, at, nanoscale, can, be, rationalized, by, an, energy, model, during, sliding, a, new, surface, forms, at, the, back, of, a, sliding, true, contact, and, existing, surface, disappears, at, the, front, of, it, since, all, surfaces, involve, the, thermodynamic, surface, energy, work, must, be, spent, in, creating, the, new, surface, and, energy, is, released, as, heat, in, removing, the, surface, thus, a, force, is, required, to, move, the, back, of, the, contact, and, frictional, heat, is, released, at, the, front, for, certain, applications, it, is, more, useful, to, define, static, friction, in, terms, of, the, maximum, angle, before, which, one, of, the, items, will, begin, sliding, this, is, called, the, angle, of, friction, or, friction, angle, it, is, defined, as, tan, s, displaystyle, tan, theta, mu, mathrm, s, and, thus, arctan, s, displaystyle, theta, arctan, mu, mathrm, s, where, displaystyle, theta, is, the, angle, from, horizontal, and, s, is, the, static, coefficient, of, friction, between, the, objects, this, formula, can, also, be, used, to, calculate, s, from, empirical, measurements, of, the, friction, angle, determining, the, forces, required, to, move, atoms, past, each, other, is, a, challenge, in, designing, nanomachines, in, 2008, scientists, for, the, first, time, were, able, to, move, a, single, atom, across, a, surface, and, measure, the, forces, required, using, ultrahigh, vacuum, and, nearly, zero, temperature, 5, k, a, modified, atomic, force, microscope, was, used, to, drag, a, cobalt, atom, and, a, carbon, monoxide, molecule, across, surfaces, of, copper, and, platinum, the, coulomb, approximation, follows, from, the, assumptions, that, surfaces, are, in, atomically, close, contact, only, over, a, small, fraction, of, their, overall, area, that, this, contact, area, is, proportional, to, the, normal, force, until, saturation, which, takes, place, when, all, area, is, in, atomic, contact, and, that, the, frictional, force, is, proportional, to, the, applied, normal, force, independently, of, the, contact, area, the, coulomb, approximation, is, fundamentally, an, empirical, construct, it, is, a, rule, of, thumb, describing, the, approximate, outcome, of, an, extremely, complicated, physical, interaction, the, strength, of, the, approximation, is, its, simplicity, and, versatility, though, the, relationship, between, normal, force, and, frictional, force, is, not, exactly, linear, and, so, the, frictional, force, is, not, entirely, independent, of, the, contact, area, of, the, surfaces, the, coulomb, approximation, is, an, adequate, representation, of, friction, for, the, analysis, of, many, physical, systems, when, the, surfaces, are, conjoined, coulomb, friction, becomes, a, very, poor, approximation, for, example, adhesive, tape, resists, sliding, even, when, there, is, no, normal, force, or, a, negative, normal, force, in, this, case, the, frictional, force, may, depend, strongly, on, the, area, of, contact, some, drag, racing, tires, are, adhesive, for, this, reason, however, despite, the, complexity, of, the, fundamental, physics, behind, friction, the, relationships, are, accurate, enough, to, be, useful, in, many, applications, as, of, 2012, a, single, study, has, demonstrated, the, potential, for, an, effectively, negative, coefficient, of, friction, in, the, low, load, regime, meaning, that, a, decrease, in, normal, force, leads, to, an, increase, in, friction, this, contradicts, everyday, experience, in, which, an, increase, in, normal, force, leads, to, an, increase, in, friction, this, was, reported, in, the, journal, nature, in, october, 2012, and, involved, the, friction, encountered, by, an, atomic, force, microscope, stylus, when, dragged, across, a, graphene, sheet, in, the, presence, of, graphene, adsorbed, oxygen, despite, being, a, simplified, model, of, friction, the, coulomb, model, is, useful, in, many, numerical, simulation, applications, such, as, multibody, systems, and, granular, material, even, its, most, simple, expression, encapsulates, the, fundamental, effects, of, sticking, and, sliding, which, are, required, in, many, applied, cases, although, specific, algorithms, have, to, be, designed, in, order, to, efficiently, numerically, integrate, mechanical, systems, with, coulomb, friction, and, bilateral, or, unilateral, contact, some, quite, nonlinear, effects, such, as, the, so, called, painlev, paradoxes, may, be, encountered, with, coulomb, friction, dry, friction, can, induce, several, types, of, instabilities, in, mechanical, systems, which, display, a, stable, behaviour, in, the, absence, of, friction, these, instabilities, may, be, caused, by, the, decrease, of, the, friction, force, with, an, increasing, velocity, of, sliding, by, material, expansion, due, to, heat, generation, during, friction, the, thermo, elastic, instabilities, or, by, pure, dynamic, effects, of, sliding, of, two, elastic, materials, the, adams, martins, instabilities, the, latter, were, originally, discovered, in, 1995, by, george, g, adams, and, jo, o, arm, nio, correia, martins, for, smooth, surfaces, and, were, later, found, in, periodic, rough, surfaces, in, particular, friction, related, dynamical, instabilities, are, thought, to, be, responsible, for, brake, squeal, and, the, song, of, a, glass, harp, phenomena, which, involve, stick, and, slip, modelled, as, a, drop, of, friction, coefficient, with, velocity, a, practically, important, case, is, the, self, oscillation, of, the, strings, of, bowed, instruments, such, as, the, violin, cello, hurdy, gurdy, erhu, etc, a, connection, between, dry, friction, and, flutter, instability, in, a, simple, mechanical, system, has, been, discovered, watch, the, movie, archived, 2015, 01, 10, at, the, wayback, machine, for, more, details, frictional, instabilities, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, new, self, organized, patterns, or, secondary, structures, at, the, sliding, interface, such, as, in, situ, formed, tribofilms, which, are, utilized, for, the, reduction, of, friction, and, wear, in, so, called, self, lubricating, materials, fluid, friction, occurs, between, fluid, layers, that, are, moving, relative, to, each, other, this, internal, resistance, to, flow, is, named, viscosity, in, everyday, terms, the, viscosity, of, a, fluid, is, described, as, its, thickness, thus, water, is, thin, having, a, lower, viscosity, while, honey, is, thick, having, a, higher, viscosity, the, less, viscous, the, fluid, the, greater, its, ease, of, deformation, or, movement, all, real, fluids, except, superfluids, offer, some, resistance, to, shearing, and, therefore, are, viscous, for, teaching, and, explanatory, purposes, it, is, helpful, to, use, the, concept, of, an, inviscid, fluid, or, an, ideal, fluid, which, offers, no, resistance, to, shearing, and, so, is, not, viscous, lubricated, friction, is, a, case, of, fluid, friction, where, a, fluid, separates, two, solid, surfaces, lubrication, is, a, technique, employed, to, reduce, wear, of, one, or, both, surfaces, in, close, proximity, moving, relative, to, each, another, by, interposing, a, substance, called, a, lubricant, between, the, surfaces, in, most, cases, the, applied, load, is, carried, by, pressure, generated, within, the, fluid, due, to, the, frictional, viscous, resistance, to, motion, of, the, lubricating, fluid, between, the, surfaces, adequate, lubrication, allows, smooth, continuous, operation, of, equipment, with, only, mild, wear, and, without, excessive, stresses, or, seizures, at, bearings, when, lubrication, breaks, down, metal, or, other, components, can, rub, destructively, over, each, other, causing, heat, and, possibly, damage, or, failure, skin, friction, arises, from, the, interaction, between, the, fluid, and, the, skin, of, the, body, and, is, directly, related, to, the, area, of, the, surface, of, the, body, that, is, in, contact, with, the, fluid, skin, friction, follows, the, drag, equation, and, rises, with, the, square, of, the, velocity, skin, friction, is, caused, by, viscous, drag, in, the, boundary, layer, around, the, object, there, are, two, ways, to, decrease, skin, friction, the, first, is, to, shape, the, moving, body, so, that, smooth, flow, is, possible, like, an, airfoil, the, second, method, is, to, decrease, the, length, and, cross, section, of, the, moving, object, as, much, as, is, practicable, internal, friction, is, the, force, resisting, motion, between, the, elements, making, up, a, solid, material, while, it, undergoes, deformation, plastic, deformation, in, solids, is, an, irreversible, change, in, the, internal, molecular, structure, of, an, object, this, change, may, be, due, to, either, or, both, an, applied, force, or, a, change, in, temperature, the, change, of, an, object, s, shape, is, called, strain, the, force, causing, it, is, called, stress, elastic, deformation, in, solids, is, reversible, change, in, the, internal, molecular, structure, of, an, object, stress, does, not, necessarily, cause, permanent, change, as, deformation, occurs, internal, forces, oppose, the, applied, force, if, the, applied, stress, is, not, too, large, these, opposing, forces, may, completely, resist, the, applied, force, allowing, the, object, to, assume, a, new, equilibrium, state, and, to, return, to, its, original, shape, when, the, force, is, removed, this, is, known, as, elastic, deformation, or, elasticity, as, a, consequence, of, light, pressure, einstein, in, 1909, predicted, the, existence, of, radiation, friction, which, would, oppose, the, movement, of, matter, he, wrote, radiation, will, exert, pressure, on, both, sides, of, the, plate, the, forces, of, pressure, exerted, on, the, two, sides, are, equal, if, the, plate, is, at, rest, however, if, it, is, in, motion, more, radiation, will, be, reflected, on, the, surface, that, is, ahead, during, the, motion, front, surface, than, on, the, back, surface, the, backward, acting, force, of, pressure, exerted, on, the, front, surface, is, thus, larger, than, the, force, of, pressure, acting, on, the, back, hence, as, the, resultant, of, the, two, forces, there, remains, a, force, that, counteracts, the, motion, of, the, plate, and, that, increases, with, the, velocity, of, the, plate, we, will, call, this, resultant, radiation, friction, in, brief, rolling, resistance, is, the, force, that, resists, the, rolling, of, a, wheel, or, other, circular, object, along, a, surface, caused, by, deformations, in, the, object, or, surface, generally, the, force, of, rolling, resistance, is, less, than, that, associated, with, kinetic, friction, typical, values, for, the, coefficient, of, rolling, resistance, are, 0, 001, one, of, the, most, common, examples, of, rolling, resistance, is, the, movement, of, motor, vehicle, tires, on, a, road, a, process, which, generates, heat, and, sound, as, by, products, any, wheel, equipped, with, a, brake, is, capable, of, generating, a, large, retarding, force, usually, for, the, purpose, of, slowing, and, stopping, a, vehicle, or, piece, of, rotating, machinery, braking, friction, differs, from, rolling, friction, because, the, coefficient, of, friction, for, rolling, friction, is, small, whereas, the, coefficient, of, friction, for, braking, friction, is, designed, to, be, large, by, choice, of, materials, for, brake, pads, rubbing, two, materials, against, each, other, can, lead, to, charge, transfer, either, electrons, or, ions, the, energy, required, for, this, contributes, to, the, friction, in, addition, sliding, can, cause, a, build, up, of, electrostatic, charge, which, can, be, hazardous, if, flammable, gases, or, vapours, are, present, when, the, static, build, up, discharges, explosions, can, be, caused, by, ignition, of, the, flammable, mixture, belt, friction, is, a, physical, property, observed, from, the, forces, acting, on, a, belt, wrapped, around, a, pulley, when, one, end, is, being, pulled, the, resulting, tension, which, acts, on, both, ends, of, the, belt, can, be, modeled, by, the, belt, friction, equation, in, practice, the, theoretical, tension, acting, on, the, belt, or, rope, calculated, by, the, belt, friction, equation, can, be, compared, to, the, maximum, tension, the, belt, can, support, this, helps, a, designer, of, such, a, rig, to, know, how, many, times, the, belt, or, rope, must, be, wrapped, around, the, pulley, to, prevent, it, from, slipping, mountain, climbers, and, sailing, crews, demonstrate, a, standard, knowledge, of, belt, friction, when, accomplishing, basic, tasks, devices, such, as, wheels, ball, bearings, roller, bearings, and, air, cushion, or, other, types, of, fluid, bearings, can, change, sliding, friction, into, a, much, smaller, type, of, rolling, friction, many, thermoplastic, materials, such, as, nylon, hdpe, and, ptfe, are, commonly, used, in, low, friction, bearings, they, are, especially, useful, because, the, coefficient, of, friction, falls, with, increasing, imposed, load, for, improved, wear, resistance, very, high, molecular, weight, grades, are, usually, specified, for, heavy, duty, or, critical, bearings, a, common, way, to, reduce, friction, is, by, using, a, lubricant, such, as, oil, water, or, grease, which, is, placed, between, the, two, surfaces, often, dramatically, lessening, the, coefficient, of, friction, the, science, of, friction, and, lubrication, is, called, tribology, lubricant, technology, is, when, lubricants, are, mixed, with, the, application, of, science, especially, to, industrial, or, commercial, objectives, superlubricity, a, recently, discovered, effect, has, been, observed, in, graphite, it, is, the, substantial, decrease, of, friction, between, two, sliding, objects, approaching, zero, levels, a, very, small, amount, of, frictional, energy, would, still, be, dissipated, lubricants, to, overcome, friction, need, not, always, be, thin, turbulent, fluids, or, powdery, solids, such, as, graphite, and, talc, acoustic, lubrication, actually, uses, sound, as, a, lubricant, another, way, to, reduce, friction, between, two, parts, is, to, superimpose, micro, scale, vibration, to, one, of, the, parts, this, can, be, sinusoidal, vibration, as, used, in, ultrasound, assisted, cutting, or, vibration, noise, known, as, dither, according, to, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, no, energy, is, destroyed, due, to, friction, though, it, may, be, lost, to, the, system, of, concern, energy, is, transformed, from, other, forms, into, thermal, energy, a, sliding, hockey, puck, comes, to, rest, because, friction, converts, its, kinetic, energy, into, heat, which, raises, the, thermal, energy, of, the, puck, and, the, ice, surface, since, heat, quickly, dissipates, many, early, philosophers, including, aristotle, wrongly, concluded, that, moving, objects, lose, energy, without, a, driving, force, when, an, object, is, pushed, along, a, surface, along, a, path, c, the, energy, converted, to, heat, is, given, by, a, line, integral, in, accordance, with, the, definition, of, work, where, dissipation, of, energy, by, friction, in, a, process, is, a, classic, example, of, thermodynamic, irreversibility, the, work, done, by, friction, can, translate, into, deformation, wear, and, heat, that, can, affect, the, contact, surface, properties, even, the, coefficient, of, friction, between, the, surfaces, this, can, be, beneficial, as, in, polishing, the, work, of, friction, is, used, to, mix, and, join, materials, such, as, in, the, process, of, friction, welding, excessive, erosion, or, wear, of, mating, sliding, surfaces, occurs, when, work, due, to, frictional, forces, rise, to, unacceptable, levels, harder, corrosion, particles, caught, between, mating, surfaces, in, relative, motion, fretting, exacerbates, wear, of, frictional, forces, as, surfaces, are, worn, by, work, due, to, friction, fit, and, surface, finish, of, an, object, may, degrade, until, it, no, longer, functions, properly, for, example, bearing, seizure, or, failure, may, result, from, excessive, wear, due, to, work, of, friction, in, the, reference, frame, of, the, interface, between, two, surfaces, static, friction, does, no, work, because, there, is, never, displacement, between, the, surfaces, in, the, same, reference, frame, kinetic, friction, is, always, in, the, direction, opposite, the, motion, and, does, negative, work, however, friction, can, do, positive, work, in, certain, frames, of, reference, one, can, see, this, by, placing, a, heavy, box, on, a, rug, then, pulling, on, the, rug, quickly, in, this, case, the, box, slides, backwards, relative, to, the, rug, but, moves, forward, relative, to, the, frame, of, reference, in, which, the, floor, is, stationary, thus, the, kinetic, friction, between, the, box, and, rug, accelerates, the, box, in, the, same, direction, that, the, box, moves, doing, positive, work, when, sliding, takes, place, between, two, rough, bodies, in, contact, the, algebraic, sum, of, the, works, done, is, different, from, zero, and, the, algebraic, sum, of, the, quantities, of, heat, gained, by, the, two, bodies, is, equal, to, the, quantity, of, work, lost, by, friction, and, the, total, quantity, of, heat, gained, is, positive, in, a, natural, thermodynamic, process, the, work, done, by, an, agency, in, the, surroundings, of, a, thermodynamic, system, or, working, body, is, greater, than, the, work, received, by, the, body, because, of, friction, thermodynamic, work, is, measured, by, changes, in, a, body, s, state, variables, sometimes, called, work, like, variables, other, than, temperature, and, entropy, examples, of, work, like, variables, which, are, ordinary, macroscopic, physical, variables, and, which, occur, in, conjugate, pairs, are, pressure, volume, and, electric, field, electric, polarization, temperature, and, entropy, are, a, specifically, thermodynamic, conjugate, pair, of, state, variables, they, can, be, affected, microscopically, at, an, atomic, level, by, mechanisms, such, as, friction, thermal, conduction, and, radiation, the, part, of, the, work, done, by, an, agency, in, the, surroundings, that, does, not, change, the, volume, of, the, working, body, but, is, dissipated, in, friction, is, called, isochoric, work, it, is, received, as, heat, by, the, working, body, and, sometimes, partly, by, a, body, in, the, surroundings, it, is, not, counted, as, thermodynamic, work, received, by, the, working, body, friction, is, an, important, factor, in, many, engineering, disciplines
