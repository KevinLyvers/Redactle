a, variable, star, is, a, star, whose, brightness, as, seen, from, earth, its, apparent, magnitude, changes, systematically, with, time, this, variation, may, be, caused, by, a, change, in, emitted, light, or, by, something, partly, blocking, the, light, so, variable, stars, are, classified, as, either, many, possibly, most, stars, exhibit, at, least, some, oscillation, in, luminosity, the, energy, output, of, the, sun, for, example, varies, by, about, 0, 1, over, an, 11, year, solar, cycle, an, ancient, egyptian, calendar, of, lucky, and, unlucky, days, composed, some, 3, 200, years, ago, may, be, the, oldest, preserved, historical, document, of, the, discovery, of, a, variable, star, the, eclipsing, binary, algol, aboriginal, australians, are, also, known, to, have, observed, the, variability, of, betelgeuse, and, antares, incorporating, these, brightness, changes, into, narratives, that, are, passed, down, through, oral, tradition, of, the, modern, astronomers, the, first, variable, star, was, identified, in, 1638, when, johannes, holwarda, noticed, that, omicron, ceti, later, named, mira, pulsated, in, a, cycle, taking, 11, months, the, star, had, previously, been, described, as, a, nova, by, david, fabricius, in, 1596, this, discovery, combined, with, supernovae, observed, in, 1572, and, 1604, proved, that, the, starry, sky, was, not, eternally, invariable, as, aristotle, and, other, ancient, philosophers, had, taught, in, this, way, the, discovery, of, variable, stars, contributed, to, the, astronomical, revolution, of, the, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, centuries, the, second, variable, star, to, be, described, was, the, eclipsing, variable, algol, by, geminiano, montanari, in, 1669, john, goodricke, gave, the, correct, explanation, of, its, variability, in, 1784, chi, cygni, was, identified, in, 1686, by, g, kirch, then, r, hydrae, in, 1704, by, g, d, maraldi, by, 1786, ten, variable, stars, were, known, john, goodricke, himself, discovered, delta, cephei, and, beta, lyrae, since, 1850, the, number, of, known, variable, stars, has, increased, rapidly, especially, after, 1890, when, it, became, possible, to, identify, variable, stars, by, means, of, photography, in, 1930, astrophysicist, cecilia, payne, published, the, book, the, stars, of, high, luminosity, in, which, she, made, numerous, observations, of, variable, stars, paying, particular, attention, to, cepheid, variables, her, analyses, and, observations, of, variable, stars, carried, out, with, her, husband, sergei, gaposchkin, laid, the, basis, for, all, subsequent, work, on, the, subject, the, latest, edition, of, the, general, catalogue, of, variable, stars, 2008, lists, more, than, 46, 000, variable, stars, in, the, milky, way, as, well, as, 10, 000, in, other, galaxies, and, over, 10, 000, suspected, variables, the, most, common, kinds, of, variability, involve, changes, in, brightness, but, other, types, of, variability, also, occur, in, particular, changes, in, the, spectrum, by, combining, light, curve, data, with, observed, spectral, changes, astronomers, are, often, able, to, explain, why, a, particular, star, is, variable, variable, stars, are, generally, analysed, using, photometry, spectrophotometry, and, spectroscopy, measurements, of, their, changes, in, brightness, can, be, plotted, to, produce, light, curves, for, regular, variables, the, period, of, variation, and, its, amplitude, can, be, very, well, established, for, many, variable, stars, though, these, quantities, may, vary, slowly, over, time, or, even, from, one, period, to, the, next, peak, brightnesses, in, the, light, curve, are, known, as, maxima, while, troughs, are, known, as, minima, amateur, astronomers, can, do, useful, scientific, study, of, variable, stars, by, visually, comparing, the, star, with, other, stars, within, the, same, telescopic, field, of, view, of, which, the, magnitudes, are, known, and, constant, by, estimating, the, variable, s, magnitude, and, noting, the, time, of, observation, a, visual, lightcurve, can, be, constructed, the, american, association, of, variable, star, observers, collects, such, observations, from, participants, around, the, world, and, shares, the, data, with, the, scientific, community, from, the, light, curve, the, following, data, are, derived, from, the, spectrum, the, following, data, are, derived, in, very, few, cases, it, is, possible, to, make, pictures, of, a, stellar, disk, these, may, show, darker, spots, on, its, surface, combining, light, curves, with, spectral, data, often, gives, a, clue, as, to, the, changes, that, occur, in, a, variable, star, for, example, evidence, for, a, pulsating, star, is, found, in, its, shifting, spectrum, because, its, surface, periodically, moves, toward, and, away, from, us, with, the, same, frequency, as, its, changing, brightness, about, two, thirds, of, all, variable, stars, appear, to, be, pulsating, in, the, 1930s, astronomer, arthur, stanley, eddington, showed, that, the, mathematical, equations, that, describe, the, interior, of, a, star, may, lead, to, instabilities, that, cause, a, star, to, pulsate, the, most, common, type, of, instability, is, related, to, oscillations, in, the, degree, of, ionization, in, outer, convective, layers, of, the, star, when, the, star, is, in, the, swelling, phase, its, outer, layers, expand, causing, them, to, cool, because, of, the, decreasing, temperature, the, degree, of, ionization, also, decreases, this, makes, the, gas, more, transparent, and, thus, makes, it, easier, for, the, star, to, radiate, its, energy, this, in, turn, makes, the, star, start, to, contract, as, the, gas, is, thereby, compressed, it, is, heated, and, the, degree, of, ionization, again, increases, this, makes, the, gas, more, opaque, and, radiation, temporarily, becomes, captured, in, the, gas, this, heats, the, gas, further, leading, it, to, expand, once, again, thus, a, cycle, of, expansion, and, compression, swelling, and, shrinking, is, maintained, the, pulsation, of, cepheids, is, known, to, be, driven, by, oscillations, in, the, ionization, of, helium, from, he, to, he, and, back, to, he, in, a, given, constellation, the, first, variable, stars, discovered, were, designated, with, letters, r, through, z, e, g, r, andromedae, this, system, of, nomenclature, was, developed, by, friedrich, w, argelander, who, gave, the, first, previously, unnamed, variable, in, a, constellation, the, letter, r, the, first, letter, not, used, by, bayer, letters, rr, through, rz, ss, through, sz, up, to, zz, are, used, for, the, next, discoveries, e, g, rr, lyrae, later, discoveries, used, letters, aa, through, az, bb, through, bz, and, up, to, qq, through, qz, with, j, omitted, once, those, 334, combinations, are, exhausted, variables, are, numbered, in, order, of, discovery, starting, with, the, prefixed, v335, onwards, variable, stars, may, be, either, intrinsic, or, extrinsic, these, subgroups, themselves, are, further, divided, into, specific, types, of, variable, stars, that, are, usually, named, after, their, prototype, for, example, dwarf, novae, are, designated, u, geminorum, stars, after, the, first, recognized, star, in, the, class, u, geminorum, examples, of, types, within, these, divisions, are, given, below, pulsating, stars, swell, and, shrink, affecting, their, brightness, and, spectrum, pulsations, are, generally, split, into, radial, where, the, entire, star, expands, and, shrinks, as, a, whole, and, non, radial, where, one, part, of, the, star, expands, while, another, part, shrinks, depending, on, the, type, of, pulsation, and, its, location, within, the, star, there, is, a, natural, or, fundamental, frequency, which, determines, the, period, of, the, star, stars, may, also, pulsate, in, a, harmonic, or, overtone, which, is, a, higher, frequency, corresponding, to, a, shorter, period, pulsating, variable, stars, sometimes, have, a, single, well, defined, period, but, often, they, pulsate, simultaneously, with, multiple, frequencies, and, complex, analysis, is, required, to, determine, the, separate, interfering, periods, in, some, cases, the, pulsations, do, not, have, a, defined, frequency, causing, a, random, variation, referred, to, as, stochastic, the, study, of, stellar, interiors, using, their, pulsations, is, known, as, asteroseismology, the, expansion, phase, of, a, pulsation, is, caused, by, the, blocking, of, the, internal, energy, flow, by, material, with, a, high, opacity, but, this, must, occur, at, a, particular, depth, of, the, star, to, create, visible, pulsations, if, the, expansion, occurs, below, a, convective, zone, then, no, variation, will, be, visible, at, the, surface, if, the, expansion, occurs, too, close, to, the, surface, the, restoring, force, will, be, too, weak, to, create, a, pulsation, the, restoring, force, to, create, the, contraction, phase, of, a, pulsation, can, be, pressure, if, the, pulsation, occurs, in, a, non, degenerate, layer, deep, inside, a, star, and, this, is, called, an, acoustic, or, pressure, mode, of, pulsation, abbreviated, to, p, mode, in, other, cases, the, restoring, force, is, gravity, and, this, is, called, a, g, mode, pulsating, variable, stars, typically, pulsate, in, only, one, of, these, modes, this, group, consists, of, several, kinds, of, pulsating, stars, all, found, on, the, instability, strip, that, swell, and, shrink, very, regularly, caused, by, the, star, s, own, mass, resonance, generally, by, the, fundamental, frequency, generally, the, eddington, valve, mechanism, for, pulsating, variables, is, believed, to, account, for, cepheid, like, pulsations, each, of, the, subgroups, on, the, instability, strip, has, a, fixed, relationship, between, period, and, absolute, magnitude, as, well, as, a, relation, between, period, and, mean, density, of, the, star, the, period, luminosity, relationship, was, first, established, for, delta, cepheids, by, henrietta, leavitt, and, makes, these, high, luminosity, cepheids, very, useful, for, determining, distances, to, galaxies, within, the, local, group, and, beyond, edwin, hubble, used, this, method, to, prove, that, the, so, called, spiral, nebulae, are, in, fact, distant, galaxies, the, cepheids, are, named, only, for, delta, cephei, while, a, completely, separate, class, of, variables, is, named, after, beta, cephei, classical, cepheids, or, delta, cephei, variables, are, population, i, young, massive, and, luminous, yellow, supergiants, which, undergo, pulsations, with, very, regular, periods, on, the, order, of, days, to, months, on, september, 10, 1784, edward, pigott, detected, the, variability, of, eta, aquilae, the, first, known, representative, of, the, class, of, cepheid, variables, however, the, namesake, for, classical, cepheids, is, the, star, delta, cephei, discovered, to, be, variable, by, john, goodricke, a, few, months, later, type, ii, cepheids, historically, termed, w, virginis, stars, have, extremely, regular, light, pulsations, and, a, luminosity, relation, much, like, the, cephei, variables, so, initially, they, were, confused, with, the, latter, category, type, ii, cepheids, stars, belong, to, older, population, ii, stars, than, do, the, type, i, cepheids, the, type, ii, have, somewhat, lower, metallicity, much, lower, mass, somewhat, lower, luminosity, and, a, slightly, offset, period, versus, luminosity, relationship, so, it, is, always, important, to, know, which, type, of, star, is, being, observed, these, stars, are, somewhat, similar, to, cepheids, but, are, not, as, luminous, and, have, shorter, periods, they, are, older, than, type, i, cepheids, belonging, to, population, ii, but, of, lower, mass, than, type, ii, cepheids, due, to, their, common, occurrence, in, globular, clusters, they, are, occasionally, referred, to, as, cluster, cepheids, they, also, have, a, well, established, period, luminosity, relationship, and, so, are, also, useful, as, distance, indicators, these, a, type, stars, vary, by, about, 0, 2, 2, magnitudes, 20, to, over, 500, change, in, luminosity, over, a, period, of, several, hours, to, a, day, or, more, delta, scuti, sct, variables, are, similar, to, cepheids, but, much, fainter, and, with, much, shorter, periods, they, were, once, known, as, dwarf, cepheids, they, often, show, many, superimposed, periods, which, combine, to, form, an, extremely, complex, light, curve, the, typical, scuti, star, has, an, amplitude, of, 0, 003, 0, 9, magnitudes, 0, 3, to, about, 130, change, in, luminosity, and, a, period, of, 0, 01, 0, 2, days, their, spectral, type, is, usually, between, a0, and, f5, these, stars, of, spectral, type, a2, to, f5, similar, to, scuti, variables, are, found, mainly, in, globular, clusters, they, exhibit, fluctuations, in, their, brightness, in, the, order, of, 0, 7, magnitude, about, 100, change, in, luminosity, or, so, every, 1, to, 2, hours, these, stars, of, spectral, type, a, or, occasionally, f0, a, sub, class, of, scuti, variables, found, on, the, main, sequence, they, have, extremely, rapid, variations, with, periods, of, a, few, minutes, and, amplitudes, of, a, few, thousandths, of, a, magnitude, the, long, period, variables, are, cool, evolved, stars, that, pulsate, with, periods, in, the, range, of, weeks, to, several, years, mira, variables, are, asymptotic, giant, branch, agb, red, giants, over, periods, of, many, months, they, fade, and, brighten, by, between, 2, 5, and, 11, magnitudes, a, 6, fold, to, 30, 000, fold, change, in, luminosity, mira, itself, also, known, as, omicron, ceti, cet, varies, in, brightness, from, almost, 2nd, magnitude, to, as, faint, as, 10th, magnitude, with, a, period, of, roughly, 332, days, the, very, large, visual, amplitudes, are, mainly, due, to, the, shifting, of, energy, output, between, visual, and, infra, red, as, the, temperature, of, the, star, changes, in, a, few, cases, mira, variables, show, dramatic, period, changes, over, a, period, of, decades, thought, to, be, related, to, the, thermal, pulsing, cycle, of, the, most, advanced, agb, stars, these, are, red, giants, or, supergiants, semiregular, variables, may, show, a, definite, period, on, occasion, but, more, often, show, less, well, defined, variations, that, can, sometimes, be, resolved, into, multiple, periods, a, well, known, example, of, a, semiregular, variable, is, betelgeuse, which, varies, from, about, magnitudes, 0, 2, to, 1, 2, a, factor, 2, 5, change, in, luminosity, at, least, some, of, the, semi, regular, variables, are, very, closely, related, to, mira, variables, possibly, the, only, difference, being, pulsating, in, a, different, harmonic, these, are, red, giants, or, supergiants, with, little, or, no, detectable, periodicity, some, are, poorly, studied, semiregular, variables, often, with, multiple, periods, but, others, may, simply, be, chaotic, many, variable, red, giants, and, supergiants, show, variations, over, several, hundred, to, several, thousand, days, the, brightness, may, change, by, several, magnitudes, although, it, is, often, much, smaller, with, the, more, rapid, primary, variations, are, superimposed, the, reasons, for, this, type, of, variation, are, not, clearly, understood, being, variously, ascribed, to, pulsations, binarity, and, stellar, rotation, beta, cephei, cep, variables, sometimes, called, beta, canis, majoris, variables, especially, in, europe, undergo, short, period, pulsations, in, the, order, of, 0, 1, 0, 6, days, with, an, amplitude, of, 0, 01, 0, 3, magnitudes, 1, to, 30, change, in, luminosity, they, are, at, their, brightest, during, minimum, contraction, many, stars, of, this, kind, exhibits, multiple, pulsation, periods, slowly, pulsating, b, spb, stars, are, hot, main, sequence, stars, slightly, less, luminous, than, the, beta, cephei, stars, with, longer, periods, and, larger, amplitudes, the, prototype, of, this, rare, class, is, v361, hydrae, a, 15th, magnitude, subdwarf, b, star, they, pulsate, with, periods, of, a, few, minutes, and, may, simultaneous, pulsate, with, multiple, periods, they, have, amplitudes, of, a, few, hundredths, of, a, magnitude, and, are, given, the, gcvs, acronym, rphs, they, are, p, mode, pulsators, stars, in, this, class, are, type, bp, supergiants, with, a, period, of, 0, 1, 1, day, and, an, amplitude, of, 0, 1, magnitude, on, average, their, spectra, are, peculiar, by, having, weak, hydrogen, while, on, the, other, hand, carbon, and, helium, lines, are, extra, strong, a, type, of, extreme, helium, star, these, are, yellow, supergiant, stars, actually, low, mass, post, agb, stars, at, the, most, luminous, stage, of, their, lives, which, have, alternating, deep, and, shallow, minima, this, double, peaked, variation, typically, has, periods, of, 30, 100, days, and, amplitudes, of, 3, 4, magnitudes, superimposed, on, this, variation, there, may, be, long, term, variations, over, periods, of, several, years, their, spectra, are, of, type, f, or, g, at, maximum, light, and, type, k, or, m, at, minimum, brightness, they, lie, near, the, instability, strip, cooler, than, type, i, cepheids, more, luminous, than, type, ii, cepheids, their, pulsations, are, caused, by, the, same, basic, mechanisms, related, to, helium, opacity, but, they, are, at, a, very, different, stage, of, their, lives, alpha, cygni, cyg, variables, are, nonradially, pulsating, supergiants, of, spectral, classes, b, ep, to, a, ep, ia, their, periods, range, from, several, days, to, several, weeks, and, their, amplitudes, of, variation, are, typically, of, the, order, of, 0, 1, magnitudes, the, light, changes, which, often, seem, irregular, are, caused, by, the, superposition, of, many, oscillations, with, close, periods, deneb, in, the, constellation, of, cygnus, is, the, prototype, of, this, class, gamma, doradus, dor, variables, are, non, radially, pulsating, main, sequence, stars, of, spectral, classes, f, to, late, a, their, periods, are, around, one, day, and, their, amplitudes, typically, of, the, order, of, 0, 1, magnitudes, these, non, radially, pulsating, stars, have, short, periods, of, hundreds, to, thousands, of, seconds, with, tiny, fluctuations, of, 0, 001, to, 0, 2, magnitudes, known, types, of, pulsating, white, dwarf, or, pre, white, dwarf, include, the, dav, or, zz, ceti, stars, with, hydrogen, dominated, atmospheres, and, the, spectral, type, da, dbv, or, v777, her, stars, with, helium, dominated, atmospheres, and, the, spectral, type, db, and, gw, vir, stars, with, atmospheres, dominated, by, helium, carbon, and, oxygen, gw, vir, stars, may, be, subdivided, into, dov, and, pnnv, stars, the, sun, oscillates, with, very, low, amplitude, in, a, large, number, of, modes, having, periods, around, 5, minutes, the, study, of, these, oscillations, is, known, as, helioseismology, oscillations, in, the, sun, are, driven, stochastically, by, convection, in, its, outer, layers, the, term, solar, like, oscillations, is, used, to, describe, oscillations, in, other, stars, that, are, excited, in, the, same, way, and, the, study, of, these, oscillations, is, one, of, the, main, areas, of, active, research, in, the, field, of, asteroseismology, a, blue, large, amplitude, pulsator, blap, is, a, pulsating, star, characterized, by, changes, of, 0, 2, to, 0, 4, magnitudes, with, typical, periods, of, 20, to, 40, minutes, a, fast, yellow, pulsating, supergiant, fyps, is, a, luminous, yellow, supergiant, with, pulsations, shorter, than, a, day, they, are, thought, to, have, evolved, beyond, a, red, supergiant, phase, but, the, mechanism, for, the, pulsations, is, unknown, the, class, was, named, in, 2020, through, analysis, of, tess, observations, eruptive, variable, stars, show, irregular, or, semi, regular, brightness, variations, caused, by, material, being, lost, from, the, star, or, in, some, cases, being, accreted, to, it, despite, the, name, these, are, not, explosive, events, protostars, are, young, objects, that, have, not, yet, completed, the, process, of, contraction, from, a, gas, nebula, to, a, veritable, star, most, protostars, exhibit, irregular, brightness, variations, variability, of, more, massive, 2, 8, solar, mass, herbig, ae, be, stars, is, thought, to, be, due, to, gas, dust, clumps, orbiting, in, the, circumstellar, disks, orion, variables, are, young, hot, pre, main, sequence, stars, usually, embedded, in, nebulosity, they, have, irregular, periods, with, amplitudes, of, several, magnitudes, a, well, known, subtype, of, orion, variables, are, the, t, tauri, variables, variability, of, t, tauri, stars, is, due, to, spots, on, the, stellar, surface, and, gas, dust, clumps, orbiting, in, the, circumstellar, disks, these, stars, reside, in, reflection, nebulae, and, show, gradual, increases, in, their, luminosity, in, the, order, of, 6, magnitudes, followed, by, a, lengthy, phase, of, constant, brightness, they, then, dim, by, 2, magnitudes, six, times, dimmer, or, so, over, a, period, of, many, years, v1057, cygni, for, example, dimmed, by, 2, 5, magnitude, ten, times, dimmer, during, an, eleven, year, period, fu, orionis, variables, are, of, spectral, type, a, through, g, and, are, possibly, an, evolutionary, phase, in, the, life, of, t, tauri, stars, large, stars, lose, their, matter, relatively, easily, for, this, reason, variability, due, to, eruptions, and, mass, loss, is, fairly, common, among, giants, and, supergiants, also, known, as, the, s, doradus, variables, the, most, luminous, stars, known, belong, to, this, class, examples, include, the, hypergiants, carinae, and, p, cygni, they, have, permanent, high, mass, loss, but, at, intervals, of, years, internal, pulsations, cause, the, star, to, exceed, its, eddington, limit, and, the, mass, loss, increases, hugely, visual, brightness, increases, although, the, overall, luminosity, is, largely, unchanged, giant, eruptions, observed, in, a, few, lbvs, do, increase, the, luminosity, so, much, so, that, they, have, been, tagged, supernova, impostors, and, may, be, a, different, type, of, event, these, massive, evolved, stars, are, unstable, due, to, their, high, luminosity, and, position, above, the, instability, strip, and, they, exhibit, slow, but, sometimes, large, photometric, and, spectroscopic, changes, due, to, high, mass, loss, and, occasional, larger, eruptions, combined, with, secular, variation, on, an, observable, timescale, the, best, known, example, is, rho, cassiopeiae, while, classed, as, eruptive, variables, these, stars, do, not, undergo, periodic, increases, in, brightness, instead, they, spend, most, of, their, time, at, maximum, brightness, but, at, irregular, intervals, they, suddenly, fade, by, 1, 9, magnitudes, 2, 5, to, 4000, times, dimmer, before, recovering, to, their, initial, brightness, over, months, to, years, most, are, classified, as, yellow, supergiants, by, luminosity, although, they, are, actually, post, agb, stars, but, there, are, both, red, and, blue, giant, r, crb, stars, r, coronae, borealis, r, crb, is, the, prototype, star, dy, persei, variables, are, a, subclass, of, r, crb, variables, that, have, a, periodic, variability, in, addition, to, their, eruptions, classic, population, i, wolf, rayet, stars, are, massive, hot, stars, that, sometimes, show, variability, probably, due, to, several, different, causes, including, binary, interactions, and, rotating, gas, clumps, around, the, star, they, exhibit, broad, emission, line, spectra, with, helium, nitrogen, carbon, and, oxygen, lines, variations, in, some, stars, appear, to, be, stochastic, while, others, show, multiple, periods, gamma, cassiopeiae, cas, variables, are, non, supergiant, fast, rotating, b, class, emission, line, type, stars, that, fluctuate, irregularly, by, up, to, 1, 5, magnitudes, 4, fold, change, in, luminosity, due, to, the, ejection, of, matter, at, their, equatorial, regions, caused, by, the, rapid, rotational, velocity, in, main, sequence, stars, major, eruptive, variability, is, exceptional, it, is, common, only, among, the, flare, stars, also, known, as, the, uv, ceti, variables, very, faint, main, sequence, stars, which, undergo, regular, flares, they, increase, in, brightness, by, up, to, two, magnitudes, six, times, brighter, in, just, a, few, seconds, and, then, fade, back, to, normal, brightness, in, half, an, hour, or, less, several, nearby, red, dwarfs, are, flare, stars, including, proxima, centauri, and, wolf, 359, these, are, close, binary, systems, with, highly, active, chromospheres, including, huge, sunspots, and, flares, believed, to, be, enhanced, by, the, close, companion, variability, scales, ranges, from, days, close, to, the, orbital, period, and, sometimes, also, with, eclipses, to, years, as, sunspot, activity, varies, supernovae, are, the, most, dramatic, type, of, cataclysmic, variable, being, some, of, the, most, energetic, events, in, the, universe, a, supernova, can, briefly, emit, as, much, energy, as, an, entire, galaxy, brightening, by, more, than, 20, magnitudes, over, one, hundred, million, times, brighter, the, supernova, explosion, is, caused, by, a, white, dwarf, or, a, star, core, reaching, a, certain, mass, density, limit, the, chandrasekhar, limit, causing, the, object, to, collapse, in, a, fraction, of, a, second, this, collapse, bounces, and, causes, the, star, to, explode, and, emit, this, enormous, energy, quantity, the, outer, layers, of, these, stars, are, blown, away, at, speeds, of, many, thousands, of, kilometers, per, second, the, expelled, matter, may, form, nebulae, called, supernova, remnants, a, well, known, example, of, such, a, nebula, is, the, crab, nebula, left, over, from, a, supernova, that, was, observed, in, china, and, elsewhere, in, 1054, the, progenitor, object, may, either, disintegrate, completely, in, the, explosion, or, in, the, case, of, a, massive, star, the, core, can, become, a, neutron, star, generally, a, pulsar, or, a, black, hole, supernovae, can, result, from, the, death, of, an, extremely, massive, star, many, times, heavier, than, the, sun, at, the, end, of, the, life, of, this, massive, star, a, non, fusible, iron, core, is, formed, from, fusion, ashes, this, iron, core, is, pushed, towards, the, chandrasekhar, limit, till, it, surpasses, it, and, therefore, collapses, one, of, the, most, studied, supernovae, of, this, type, is, sn, 1987a, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, a, supernova, may, also, result, from, mass, transfer, onto, a, white, dwarf, from, a, star, companion, in, a, double, star, system, the, chandrasekhar, limit, is, surpassed, from, the, infalling, matter, the, absolute, luminosity, of, this, latter, type, is, related, to, properties, of, its, light, curve, so, that, these, supernovae, can, be, used, to, establish, the, distance, to, other, galaxies, luminous, red, novae, are, stellar, explosions, caused, by, the, merger, of, two, stars, they, are, not, related, to, classical, novae, they, have, a, characteristic, red, appearance, and, very, slow, decline, following, the, initial, outburst, novae, are, also, the, result, of, dramatic, explosions, but, unlike, supernovae, do, not, result, in, the, destruction, of, the, progenitor, star, also, unlike, supernovae, novae, ignite, from, the, sudden, onset, of, thermonuclear, fusion, which, under, certain, high, pressure, conditions, degenerate, matter, accelerates, explosively, they, form, in, close, binary, systems, one, component, being, a, white, dwarf, accreting, matter, from, the, other, ordinary, star, component, and, may, recur, over, periods, of, decades, to, centuries, or, millennia, novae, are, categorised, as, fast, slow, or, very, slow, depending, on, the, behaviour, of, their, light, curve, several, naked, eye, novae, have, been, recorded, nova, cygni, 1975, being, the, brightest, in, the, recent, history, reaching, 2nd, magnitude, dwarf, novae, are, double, stars, involving, a, white, dwarf, in, which, matter, transfer, between, the, component, gives, rise, to, regular, outbursts, there, are, three, types, of, dwarf, nova, dq, herculis, systems, are, interacting, binaries, in, which, a, low, mass, star, transfers, mass, to, a, highly, magnetic, white, dwarf, the, white, dwarf, spin, period, is, significantly, shorter, than, the, binary, orbital, period, and, can, sometimes, be, detected, as, a, photometric, periodicity, an, accretion, disk, usually, forms, around, the, white, dwarf, but, its, innermost, regions, are, magnetically, truncated, by, the, white, dwarf, once, captured, by, the, white, dwarf, s, magnetic, field, the, material, from, the, inner, disk, travels, along, the, magnetic, field, lines, until, it, accretes, in, extreme, cases, the, white, dwarf, s, magnetism, prevents, the, formation, of, an, accretion, disk, in, these, cataclysmic, variables, the, white, dwarf, s, magnetic, field, is, so, strong, that, it, synchronizes, the, white, dwarf, s, spin, period, with, the, binary, orbital, period, instead, of, forming, an, accretion, disk, the, accretion, flow, is, channeled, along, the, white, dwarf, s, magnetic, field, lines, until, it, impacts, the, white, dwarf, near, a, magnetic, pole, cyclotron, radiation, beamed, from, the, accretion, region, can, cause, orbital, variations, of, several, magnitudes, these, symbiotic, binary, systems, are, composed, of, a, red, giant, and, a, hot, blue, star, enveloped, in, a, cloud, of, gas, and, dust, they, undergo, nova, like, outbursts, with, amplitudes, of, up, to, 4, magnitudes, the, prototype, for, this, class, is, z, andromedae, am, cvn, variables, are, symbiotic, binaries, where, a, white, dwarf, is, accreting, helium, rich, material, from, either, another, white, dwarf, a, helium, star, or, an, evolved, main, sequence, star, they, undergo, complex, variations, or, at, times, no, variations, with, ultrashort, periods, there, are, two, main, groups, of, extrinsic, variables, rotating, stars, and, eclipsing, stars, stars, with, sizeable, sunspots, may, show, significant, variations, in, brightness, as, they, rotate, and, brighter, areas, of, the, surface, are, brought, into, view, bright, spots, also, occur, at, the, magnetic, poles, of, magnetic, stars, stars, with, ellipsoidal, shapes, may, also, show, changes, in, brightness, as, they, present, varying, areas, of, their, surfaces, to, the, observer, these, are, very, close, binaries, the, components, of, which, are, non, spherical, due, to, their, tidal, interaction, as, the, stars, rotate, the, area, of, their, surface, presented, towards, the, observer, changes, and, this, in, turn, affects, their, brightness, as, seen, from, earth, the, surface, of, the, star, is, not, uniformly, bright, but, has, darker, and, brighter, areas, like, the, sun, s, solar, spots, the, star, s, chromosphere, too, may, vary, in, brightness, as, the, star, rotates, we, observe, brightness, variations, of, a, few, tenths, of, magnitudes, these, stars, rotate, extremely, rapidly, 100, km, s, at, the, equator, hence, they, are, ellipsoidal, in, shape, they, are, apparently, single, giant, stars, with, spectral, types, g, and, k, and, show, strong, chromospheric, emission, lines, examples, are, fk, com, v1794, cygni, and, uz, librae, a, possible, explanation, for, the, rapid, rotation, of, fk, comae, stars, is, that, they, are, the, result, of, the, merger, of, a, contact, binary, by, draconis, stars, are, of, spectral, class, k, or, m, and, vary, by, less, than, 0, 5, magnitudes, 70, change, in, luminosity, alpha, 2, canum, venaticorum, 2, cvn, variables, are, main, sequence, stars, of, spectral, class, b8, a7, that, show, fluctuations, of, 0, 01, to, 0, 1, magnitudes, 1, to, 10, due, to, changes, in, their, magnetic, fields, stars, in, this, class, exhibit, brightness, fluctuations, of, some, 0, 1, magnitude, caused, by, changes, in, their, magnetic, fields, due, to, high, rotation, speeds, few, pulsars, have, been, detected, in, visible, light, these, neutron, stars, change, in, brightness, as, they, rotate, because, of, the, rapid, rotation, brightness, variations, are, extremely, fast, from, milliseconds, to, a, few, seconds, the, first, and, the, best, known, example, is, the, crab, pulsar, extrinsic, variables, have, variations, in, their, brightness, as, seen, by, terrestrial, observers, due, to, some, external, source, one, of, the, most, common, reasons, for, this, is, the, presence, of, a, binary, companion, star, so, that, the, two, together, form, a, binary, star, when, seen, from, certain, angles, one, star, may, eclipse, the, other, causing, a, reduction, in, brightness, one, of, the, most, famous, eclipsing, binaries, is, algol, or, beta, persei, per, algol, variables, undergo, eclipses, with, one, or, two, minima, separated, by, periods, of, nearly, constant, light, the, prototype, of, this, class, is, algol, in, the, constellation, perseus, double, periodic, variables, exhibit, cyclical, mass, exchange, which, causes, the, orbital, period, to, vary, predictably, over, a, very, long, period, the, best, known, example, is, v393, scorpii, beta, lyrae, lyr, variables, are, extremely, close, binaries, named, after, the, star, sheliak, the, light, curves, of, this, class, of, eclipsing, variables, are, constantly, changing, making, it, almost, impossible, to, determine, the, exact, onset, and, end, of, each, eclipse, w, serpentis, is, the, prototype, of, a, class, of, semi, detached, binaries, including, a, giant, or, supergiant, transferring, material, to, a, massive, more, compact, star, they, are, characterised, and, distinguished, from, the, similar, lyr, systems, by, strong, uv, emission, from, accretions, hotspots, on, a, disc, of, material, the, stars, in, this, group, show, periods, of, less, than, a, day, the, stars, are, so, closely, situated, to, each, other, that, their, surfaces, are, almost, in, contact, with, each, other, stars, with, planets, may, also, show, brightness, variations, if, their, planets, pass, between, earth, and, the, star, these, variations, are, much, smaller, than, those, seen, with, stellar, companions, and, are, only, detectable, with, extremely, accurate, observations, examples, include, hd, 209458, and, gsc, 02652, 01324, and, all, of, the, planets, and, planet, candidates, detected, by, the, kepler, mission
