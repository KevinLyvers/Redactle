nature, is, an, inherent, character, or, constitution, particularly, of, the, ecosphere, or, the, universe, as, a, whole, in, this, general, sense, nature, refers, to, the, laws, elements, and, phenomena, of, the, physical, world, including, life, although, humans, are, part, of, nature, human, activity, or, humans, as, a, whole, are, often, described, as, at, times, at, odds, or, outright, separate, and, even, superior, to, nature, during, the, advent, of, modern, scientific, method, in, the, last, several, centuries, nature, became, the, passive, reality, organized, and, moved, by, divine, laws, with, the, industrial, revolution, nature, increasingly, became, seen, as, the, part, of, reality, deprived, from, intentional, intervention, it, was, hence, considered, as, sacred, by, some, traditions, rousseau, american, transcendentalism, or, a, mere, decorum, for, divine, providence, or, human, history, hegel, marx, however, a, vitalist, vision, of, nature, closer, to, the, pre, socratic, one, got, reborn, at, the, same, time, especially, after, charles, darwin, within, the, various, uses, of, the, word, today, nature, often, refers, to, geology, and, wildlife, nature, can, refer, to, the, general, realm, of, living, beings, and, in, some, cases, to, the, processes, associated, with, inanimate, objects, the, way, that, particular, types, of, things, exist, and, change, of, their, own, accord, such, as, the, weather, and, geology, of, the, earth, it, is, often, taken, to, mean, the, natural, environment, or, wilderness, wild, animals, rocks, forest, and, in, general, those, things, that, have, not, been, substantially, altered, by, human, intervention, or, which, persist, despite, human, intervention, for, example, manufactured, objects, and, human, interaction, generally, are, not, considered, part, of, nature, unless, qualified, as, for, example, human, nature, or, the, whole, of, nature, this, more, traditional, concept, of, natural, things, that, can, still, be, found, today, implies, a, distinction, between, the, natural, and, the, artificial, with, the, artificial, being, understood, as, that, which, has, been, brought, into, being, by, a, human, consciousness, or, a, human, mind, depending, on, the, particular, context, the, term, natural, might, also, be, distinguished, from, the, unnatural, or, the, supernatural, the, word, nature, is, borrowed, from, the, old, french, nature, and, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, natura, or, essential, qualities, innate, disposition, and, in, ancient, times, literally, meant, birth, in, ancient, philosophy, natura, is, mostly, used, as, the, latin, translation, of, the, greek, word, physis, which, originally, related, to, the, intrinsic, characteristics, of, plants, animals, and, other, features, of, the, world, to, develop, of, their, own, accord, the, concept, of, nature, as, a, whole, the, physical, universe, is, one, of, several, expansions, of, the, original, notion, it, began, with, certain, core, applications, of, the, word, by, pre, socratic, philosophers, though, this, word, had, a, dynamic, dimension, then, especially, for, heraclitus, and, has, steadily, gained, currency, ever, since, earth, is, the, only, planet, known, to, support, life, and, its, natural, features, are, the, subject, of, many, fields, of, scientific, research, within, the, solar, system, it, is, third, closest, to, the, sun, it, is, the, largest, terrestrial, planet, and, the, fifth, largest, overall, its, most, prominent, climatic, features, are, its, two, large, polar, regions, two, relatively, narrow, temperate, zones, and, a, wide, equatorial, tropical, to, subtropical, region, precipitation, varies, widely, with, location, from, several, metres, of, water, per, year, to, less, than, a, millimetre, 71, percent, of, the, earth, s, surface, is, covered, by, salt, water, oceans, the, remainder, consists, of, continents, and, islands, with, most, of, the, inhabited, land, in, the, northern, hemisphere, earth, has, evolved, through, geological, and, biological, processes, that, have, left, traces, of, the, original, conditions, the, outer, surface, is, divided, into, several, gradually, migrating, tectonic, plates, the, interior, remains, active, with, a, thick, layer, of, plastic, mantle, and, an, iron, filled, core, that, generates, a, magnetic, field, this, iron, core, is, composed, of, a, solid, inner, phase, and, a, fluid, outer, phase, convective, motion, in, the, core, generates, electric, currents, through, dynamo, action, and, these, in, turn, generate, the, geomagnetic, field, the, atmospheric, conditions, have, been, significantly, altered, from, the, original, conditions, by, the, presence, of, life, forms, which, create, an, ecological, balance, that, stabilizes, the, surface, conditions, despite, the, wide, regional, variations, in, climate, by, latitude, and, other, geographic, factors, the, long, term, average, global, climate, is, quite, stable, during, interglacial, periods, and, variations, of, a, degree, or, two, of, average, global, temperature, have, historically, had, major, effects, on, the, ecological, balance, and, on, the, actual, geography, of, the, earth, geology, is, the, science, and, study, of, the, solid, and, liquid, matter, that, constitutes, the, earth, the, field, of, geology, encompasses, the, study, of, the, composition, structure, physical, properties, dynamics, and, history, of, earth, materials, and, the, processes, by, which, they, are, formed, moved, and, changed, the, field, is, a, major, academic, discipline, and, is, also, important, for, mineral, and, hydrocarbon, extraction, knowledge, about, and, mitigation, of, natural, hazards, some, geotechnical, engineering, fields, and, understanding, past, climates, and, environments, the, geology, of, an, area, evolves, through, time, as, rock, units, are, deposited, and, inserted, and, deformational, processes, change, their, shapes, and, locations, rock, units, are, first, emplaced, either, by, deposition, onto, the, surface, or, intrude, into, the, overlying, rock, deposition, can, occur, when, sediments, settle, onto, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, later, lithify, into, sedimentary, rock, or, when, as, volcanic, material, such, as, volcanic, ash, or, lava, flows, blanket, the, surface, igneous, intrusions, such, as, batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and, sills, push, upwards, into, the, overlying, rock, and, crystallize, as, they, intrude, after, the, initial, sequence, of, rocks, has, been, deposited, the, rock, units, can, be, deformed, and, or, metamorphosed, deformation, typically, occurs, as, a, result, of, horizontal, shortening, horizontal, extension, or, side, to, side, strike, slip, motion, these, structural, regimes, broadly, relate, to, convergent, boundaries, divergent, boundaries, and, transform, boundaries, respectively, between, tectonic, plates, earth, is, estimated, to, have, formed, 4, 54, billion, years, ago, from, the, solar, nebula, along, with, the, sun, and, other, planets, the, moon, formed, roughly, 20, million, years, later, initially, molten, the, outer, layer, of, the, earth, cooled, resulting, in, the, solid, crust, outgassing, and, volcanic, activity, produced, the, primordial, atmosphere, condensing, water, vapor, most, or, all, of, which, came, from, ice, delivered, by, comets, produced, the, oceans, and, other, water, sources, the, highly, energetic, chemistry, is, believed, to, have, produced, a, self, replicating, molecule, around, 4, billion, years, ago, continents, formed, then, broke, up, and, reformed, as, the, surface, of, earth, reshaped, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, occasionally, combining, to, make, a, supercontinent, roughly, 750, million, years, ago, the, earliest, known, supercontinent, rodinia, began, to, break, apart, the, continents, later, recombined, to, form, pannotia, which, broke, apart, about, 540, million, years, ago, then, finally, pangaea, which, broke, apart, about, 180, million, years, ago, during, the, neoproterozoic, era, freezing, temperatures, covered, much, of, the, earth, in, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, this, hypothesis, has, been, termed, the, snowball, earth, and, it, is, of, particular, interest, as, it, precedes, the, cambrian, explosion, in, which, multicellular, life, forms, began, to, proliferate, about, 530, 540, million, years, ago, since, the, cambrian, explosion, there, have, been, five, distinctly, identifiable, mass, extinctions, the, last, mass, extinction, occurred, some, 66, million, years, ago, when, a, meteorite, collision, probably, triggered, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, other, large, reptiles, but, spared, small, animals, such, as, mammals, over, the, past, 66, million, years, mammalian, life, diversified, several, million, years, ago, a, species, of, small, african, ape, gained, the, ability, to, stand, upright, the, subsequent, advent, of, human, life, and, the, development, of, agriculture, and, further, civilization, allowed, humans, to, affect, the, earth, more, rapidly, than, any, previous, life, form, affecting, both, the, nature, and, quantity, of, other, organisms, as, well, as, global, climate, by, comparison, the, great, oxygenation, event, produced, by, the, proliferation, of, algae, during, the, siderian, period, required, about, 300, million, years, to, culminate, the, present, era, is, classified, as, part, of, a, mass, extinction, event, the, holocene, extinction, event, the, fastest, ever, to, have, occurred, some, such, as, e, o, wilson, of, harvard, university, predict, that, human, destruction, of, the, biosphere, could, cause, the, extinction, of, one, half, of, all, species, in, the, next, 100, years, the, extent, of, the, current, extinction, event, is, still, being, researched, debated, and, calculated, by, biologists, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, a, key, factor, in, sustaining, the, ecosystem, the, thin, layer, of, gases, that, envelops, the, earth, is, held, in, place, by, gravity, air, is, mostly, nitrogen, oxygen, water, vapor, with, much, smaller, amounts, of, carbon, dioxide, argon, etc, the, atmospheric, pressure, declines, steadily, with, altitude, the, ozone, layer, plays, an, important, role, in, depleting, the, amount, of, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, that, reaches, the, surface, as, dna, is, readily, damaged, by, uv, light, this, serves, to, protect, life, at, the, surface, the, atmosphere, also, retains, heat, during, the, night, thereby, reducing, the, daily, temperature, extremes, terrestrial, weather, occurs, almost, exclusively, in, the, lower, part, of, the, atmosphere, and, serves, as, a, convective, system, for, redistributing, heat, ocean, currents, are, another, important, factor, in, determining, climate, particularly, the, major, underwater, thermohaline, circulation, which, distributes, heat, energy, from, the, equatorial, oceans, to, the, polar, regions, these, currents, help, to, moderate, the, differences, in, temperature, between, winter, and, summer, in, the, temperate, zones, also, without, the, redistributions, of, heat, energy, by, the, ocean, currents, and, atmosphere, the, tropics, would, be, much, hotter, and, the, polar, regions, much, colder, weather, can, have, both, beneficial, and, harmful, effects, extremes, in, weather, such, as, tornadoes, or, hurricanes, and, cyclones, can, expend, large, amounts, of, energy, along, their, paths, and, produce, devastation, surface, vegetation, has, evolved, a, dependence, on, the, seasonal, variation, of, the, weather, and, sudden, changes, lasting, only, a, few, years, can, have, a, dramatic, effect, both, on, the, vegetation, and, on, the, animals, which, depend, on, its, growth, for, their, food, climate, is, a, measure, of, the, long, term, trends, in, the, weather, various, factors, are, known, to, influence, the, climate, including, ocean, currents, surface, albedo, greenhouse, gases, variations, in, the, solar, luminosity, and, changes, to, the, earth, s, orbit, based, on, historical, and, geological, records, the, earth, is, known, to, have, undergone, drastic, climate, changes, in, the, past, including, ice, ages, the, climate, of, a, region, depends, on, a, number, of, factors, especially, latitude, a, latitudinal, band, of, the, surface, with, similar, climatic, attributes, forms, a, climate, region, there, are, a, number, of, such, regions, ranging, from, the, tropical, climate, at, the, equator, to, the, polar, climate, in, the, northern, and, southern, extremes, weather, is, also, influenced, by, the, seasons, which, result, from, the, earth, s, axis, being, tilted, relative, to, its, orbital, plane, thus, at, any, given, time, during, the, summer, or, winter, one, part, of, the, earth, is, more, directly, exposed, to, the, rays, of, the, sun, this, exposure, alternates, as, the, earth, revolves, in, its, orbit, at, any, given, time, regardless, of, season, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, experience, opposite, seasons, weather, is, a, chaotic, system, that, is, readily, modified, by, small, changes, to, the, environment, so, accurate, weather, forecasting, is, limited, to, only, a, few, days, overall, two, things, are, happening, worldwide, 1, temperature, is, increasing, on, the, average, and, 2, regional, climates, have, been, undergoing, noticeable, changes, water, is, a, chemical, substance, that, is, composed, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, h2o, and, is, vital, for, all, known, forms, of, life, in, typical, usage, water, refers, only, to, its, liquid, form, but, it, also, has, a, solid, state, ice, and, a, gaseous, state, water, vapor, or, steam, water, covers, 71, of, the, earth, s, surface, on, earth, it, is, found, mostly, in, oceans, and, other, large, bodies, of, water, with, 1, 6, of, water, below, ground, in, aquifers, and, 0, 001, in, the, air, as, vapor, clouds, and, precipitation, oceans, hold, 97, of, surface, water, glaciers, and, polar, ice, caps, 2, 4, and, other, land, surface, water, such, as, rivers, lakes, and, ponds, 0, 6, additionally, a, minute, amount, of, the, earth, s, water, is, contained, within, biological, bodies, and, manufactured, products, an, ocean, is, a, major, body, of, saline, water, and, a, principal, component, of, the, hydrosphere, approximately, 71, of, the, earth, s, surface, an, area, of, some, 361, million, square, kilometers, is, covered, by, ocean, a, continuous, body, of, water, that, is, customarily, divided, into, several, principal, oceans, and, smaller, seas, more, than, half, of, this, area, is, over, 3, 000, meters, 9, 800, feet, deep, average, oceanic, salinity, is, around, 35, parts, per, thousand, ppt, 3, 5, and, nearly, all, seawater, has, a, salinity, in, the, range, of, 30, to, 38, ppt, though, generally, recognized, as, several, separate, oceans, these, waters, comprise, one, global, interconnected, body, of, salt, water, often, referred, to, as, the, world, ocean, or, global, ocean, this, concept, of, a, global, ocean, as, a, continuous, body, of, water, with, relatively, free, interchange, among, its, parts, is, of, fundamental, importance, to, oceanography, the, major, oceanic, divisions, are, defined, in, part, by, the, continents, various, archipelagos, and, other, criteria, these, divisions, are, in, descending, order, of, size, the, pacific, ocean, the, atlantic, ocean, the, indian, ocean, the, southern, ocean, and, the, arctic, ocean, smaller, regions, of, the, oceans, are, called, seas, gulfs, bays, and, other, names, there, are, also, salt, lakes, which, are, smaller, bodies, of, landlocked, saltwater, that, are, not, interconnected, with, the, world, ocean, two, notable, examples, of, salt, lakes, are, the, aral, sea, and, the, great, salt, lake, a, lake, from, latin, word, lacus, is, a, terrain, feature, or, physical, feature, a, body, of, liquid, on, the, surface, of, a, world, that, is, localized, to, the, bottom, of, basin, another, type, of, landform, or, terrain, feature, that, is, it, is, not, global, and, moves, slowly, if, it, moves, at, all, on, earth, a, body, of, water, is, considered, a, lake, when, it, is, inland, not, part, of, the, ocean, is, larger, and, deeper, than, a, pond, and, is, fed, by, a, river, the, only, world, other, than, earth, known, to, harbor, lakes, is, titan, saturn, s, largest, moon, which, has, lakes, of, ethane, most, likely, mixed, with, methane, it, is, not, known, if, titan, s, lakes, are, fed, by, rivers, though, titan, s, surface, is, carved, by, numerous, river, beds, natural, lakes, on, earth, are, generally, found, in, mountainous, areas, rift, zones, and, areas, with, ongoing, or, recent, glaciation, other, lakes, are, found, in, endorheic, basins, or, along, the, courses, of, mature, rivers, in, some, parts, of, the, world, there, are, many, lakes, because, of, chaotic, drainage, patterns, left, over, from, the, last, ice, age, all, lakes, are, temporary, over, geologic, time, scales, as, they, will, slowly, fill, in, with, sediments, or, spill, out, of, the, basin, containing, them, a, pond, is, a, body, of, standing, water, either, natural, or, human, made, that, is, usually, smaller, than, a, lake, a, wide, variety, of, human, made, bodies, of, water, are, classified, as, ponds, including, water, gardens, designed, for, aesthetic, ornamentation, fish, ponds, designed, for, commercial, fish, breeding, and, solar, ponds, designed, to, store, thermal, energy, ponds, and, lakes, are, distinguished, from, streams, via, current, speed, while, currents, in, streams, are, easily, observed, ponds, and, lakes, possess, thermally, driven, micro, currents, and, moderate, wind, driven, currents, these, features, distinguish, a, pond, from, many, other, aquatic, terrain, features, such, as, stream, pools, and, tide, pools, a, river, is, a, natural, watercourse, usually, freshwater, flowing, towards, an, ocean, a, lake, a, sea, or, another, river, in, a, few, cases, a, river, simply, flows, into, the, ground, or, dries, up, completely, before, reaching, another, body, of, water, small, rivers, may, also, be, called, by, several, other, names, including, stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and, rill, there, is, no, general, rule, that, defines, what, can, be, called, a, river, many, names, for, small, rivers, are, specific, to, geographic, location, one, example, is, burn, in, scotland, and, north, east, england, sometimes, a, river, is, said, to, be, larger, than, a, creek, but, this, is, not, always, the, case, due, to, vagueness, in, the, language, a, river, is, part, of, the, hydrological, cycle, water, within, a, river, is, generally, collected, from, precipitation, through, surface, runoff, groundwater, recharge, springs, and, the, release, of, stored, water, in, natural, ice, and, snowpacks, i, e, from, glaciers, a, stream, is, a, flowing, body, of, water, with, a, current, confined, within, a, bed, and, stream, banks, in, the, united, states, a, stream, is, classified, as, a, watercourse, less, than, 60, feet, 18, metres, wide, streams, are, important, as, conduits, in, the, water, cycle, instruments, in, groundwater, recharge, and, they, serve, as, corridors, for, fish, and, wildlife, migration, the, biological, habitat, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, a, stream, is, called, a, riparian, zone, given, the, status, of, the, ongoing, holocene, extinction, streams, play, an, important, corridor, role, in, connecting, fragmented, habitats, and, thus, in, conserving, biodiversity, the, study, of, streams, and, waterways, in, general, involves, many, branches, of, inter, disciplinary, natural, science, and, engineering, including, hydrology, fluvial, geomorphology, aquatic, ecology, fish, biology, riparian, ecology, and, others, ecosystems, are, composed, of, a, variety, of, biotic, and, abiotic, components, that, function, in, an, interrelated, way, the, structure, and, composition, is, determined, by, various, environmental, factors, that, are, interrelated, variations, of, these, factors, will, initiate, dynamic, modifications, to, the, ecosystem, some, of, the, more, important, components, are, soil, atmosphere, radiation, from, the, sun, water, and, living, organisms, central, to, the, ecosystem, concept, is, the, idea, that, living, organisms, interact, with, every, other, element, in, their, local, environment, eugene, odum, a, founder, of, ecology, stated, any, unit, that, includes, all, of, the, organisms, ie, the, community, in, a, given, area, interacting, with, the, physical, environment, so, that, a, flow, of, energy, leads, to, clearly, defined, trophic, structure, biotic, diversity, and, material, cycles, i, e, exchange, of, materials, between, living, and, nonliving, parts, within, the, system, is, an, ecosystem, within, the, ecosystem, species, are, connected, and, dependent, upon, one, another, in, the, food, chain, and, exchange, energy, and, matter, between, themselves, as, well, as, with, their, environment, the, human, ecosystem, concept, is, based, on, the, human, nature, dichotomy, and, the, idea, that, all, species, are, ecologically, dependent, on, each, other, as, well, as, with, the, abiotic, constituents, of, their, biotope, a, smaller, unit, of, size, is, called, a, microecosystem, for, example, a, microsystem, can, be, a, stone, and, all, the, life, under, it, a, macroecosystem, might, involve, a, whole, ecoregion, with, its, drainage, basin, wilderness, is, generally, defined, as, areas, that, have, not, been, significantly, modified, by, human, activity, wilderness, areas, can, be, found, in, preserves, estates, farms, conservation, preserves, ranches, national, forests, national, parks, and, even, in, urban, areas, along, rivers, gulches, or, otherwise, undeveloped, areas, wilderness, areas, and, protected, parks, are, considered, important, for, the, survival, of, certain, species, ecological, studies, conservation, and, solitude, some, nature, writers, believe, wilderness, areas, are, vital, for, the, human, spirit, and, creativity, and, some, ecologists, consider, wilderness, areas, to, be, an, integral, part, of, the, earth, s, self, sustaining, natural, ecosystem, the, biosphere, they, may, also, preserve, historic, genetic, traits, and, that, they, provide, habitat, for, wild, flora, and, fauna, that, may, be, difficult, or, impossible, to, recreate, in, zoos, arboretums, or, laboratories, although, there, is, no, universal, agreement, on, the, definition, of, life, scientists, generally, accept, that, the, biological, manifestation, of, life, is, characterized, by, organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response, to, stimuli, and, reproduction, life, may, also, be, said, to, be, simply, the, characteristic, state, of, organisms, present, day, organisms, from, viruses, to, humans, possess, a, self, replicating, informational, molecule, genome, either, dna, or, rna, as, in, some, viruses, and, such, an, informational, molecule, is, probably, intrinsic, to, life, it, is, likely, that, the, earliest, forms, of, life, were, based, on, a, self, replicating, informational, molecule, genome, perhaps, rna, or, a, molecule, more, primitive, than, rna, or, dna, the, specific, deoxyribonucleotide, ribonucleotide, sequence, in, each, currently, extant, individual, organism, contains, sequence, information, that, functions, to, promotes, survival, reproduction, and, the, capacity, to, acquire, resources, necessary, for, reproduction, and, such, sequences, probably, emerged, early, in, the, evolution, of, life, survival, functions, present, early, in, the, evolution, of, life, likely, also, included, genomic, sequences, that, promote, the, avoidance, of, damage, to, the, self, replicating, molecule, and, also, the, capability, to, repair, such, damages, that, do, occur, repair, of, some, genome, damages, may, have, involved, using, information, from, another, similar, molecule, by, a, process, of, recombination, a, primitive, form, of, sexual, interaction, properties, common, to, terrestrial, organisms, plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and, bacteria, are, that, they, are, cellular, carbon, and, water, based, with, complex, organization, having, a, metabolism, a, capacity, to, grow, respond, to, stimuli, and, reproduce, an, entity, with, these, properties, is, generally, considered, life, however, not, every, definition, of, life, considers, all, of, these, properties, to, be, essential, human, made, analogs, of, life, may, also, be, considered, to, be, life, the, biosphere, is, the, part, of, earth, s, outer, shell, including, land, surface, rocks, water, air, and, the, atmosphere, within, which, life, occurs, and, which, biotic, processes, in, turn, alter, or, transform, from, the, broadest, geophysiological, point, of, view, the, biosphere, is, the, global, ecological, system, integrating, all, living, beings, and, their, relationships, including, their, interaction, with, the, elements, of, the, lithosphere, rocks, hydrosphere, water, and, atmosphere, air, the, entire, earth, contains, over, 75, billion, tons, 150, trillion, pounds, or, about, 6, 8, 10, 13, kilograms, of, biomass, life, which, lives, within, various, environments, within, the, biosphere, over, nine, tenths, of, the, total, biomass, on, earth, is, plant, life, on, which, animal, life, depends, very, heavily, for, its, existence, more, than, 2, million, species, of, plant, and, animal, life, have, been, identified, to, date, and, estimates, of, the, actual, number, of, existing, species, range, from, several, million, to, well, over, 50, million, the, number, of, individual, species, of, life, is, constantly, in, some, degree, of, flux, with, new, species, appearing, and, others, ceasing, to, exist, on, a, continual, basis, the, total, number, of, species, is, in, rapid, decline, the, origin, of, life, on, earth, is, not, well, understood, but, it, is, known, to, have, occurred, at, least, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, during, the, hadean, or, archean, eons, on, a, primordial, earth, that, had, a, substantially, different, environment, than, is, found, at, present, these, life, forms, possessed, the, basic, traits, of, self, replication, and, inheritable, traits, once, life, had, appeared, the, process, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, resulted, in, the, development, of, ever, more, diverse, life, forms, species, that, were, unable, to, adapt, to, the, changing, environment, and, competition, from, other, life, forms, became, extinct, however, the, fossil, record, retains, evidence, of, many, of, these, older, species, current, fossil, and, dna, evidence, shows, that, all, existing, species, can, trace, a, continual, ancestry, back, to, the, first, primitive, life, forms, when, basic, forms, of, plant, life, developed, the, process, of, photosynthesis, the, sun, s, energy, could, be, harvested, to, create, conditions, which, allowed, for, more, complex, life, forms, the, resultant, oxygen, accumulated, in, the, atmosphere, and, gave, rise, to, the, ozone, layer, the, incorporation, of, smaller, cells, within, larger, ones, resulted, in, the, development, of, yet, more, complex, cells, called, eukaryotes, cells, within, colonies, became, increasingly, specialized, resulting, in, true, multicellular, organisms, with, the, ozone, layer, absorbing, harmful, ultraviolet, radiation, life, colonized, the, surface, of, earth, the, first, form, of, life, to, develop, on, the, earth, were, unicellular, and, they, remained, the, only, form, of, life, until, about, a, billion, years, ago, when, multi, cellular, organisms, began, to, appear, microorganisms, are, microscopic, and, smaller, than, the, human, eye, can, see, microorganisms, can, be, single, celled, such, as, bacteria, archaea, many, protista, and, a, minority, of, fungi, these, life, forms, are, found, in, almost, every, location, on, the, earth, where, there, is, liquid, water, including, in, the, earth, s, interior, their, reproduction, is, both, rapid, and, profuse, the, combination, of, a, high, mutation, rate, and, a, horizontal, gene, transfer, ability, makes, them, highly, adaptable, and, able, to, survive, in, new, environments, including, outer, space, they, form, an, essential, part, of, the, planetary, ecosystem, however, some, microorganisms, are, pathogenic, and, can, post, health, risk, to, other, organisms, viruses, are, infectious, agents, but, they, are, not, autonomous, life, forms, as, it, is, the, case, for, viroids, satellites, dpis, and, prions, originally, aristotle, divided, all, living, things, between, plants, which, generally, do, not, move, fast, enough, for, humans, to, notice, and, animals, in, linnaeus, system, these, became, the, kingdoms, vegetabilia, later, plantae, and, animalia, since, then, it, has, become, clear, that, the, plantae, as, originally, defined, included, several, unrelated, groups, and, the, fungi, and, several, groups, of, algae, were, removed, to, new, kingdoms, however, these, are, still, often, considered, plants, in, many, contexts, bacterial, life, is, sometimes, included, in, flora, and, some, classifications, use, the, term, bacterial, flora, separately, from, plant, flora, among, the, many, ways, of, classifying, plants, are, by, regional, floras, which, depending, on, the, purpose, of, study, can, also, include, fossil, flora, remnants, of, plant, life, from, a, previous, era, people, in, many, regions, and, countries, take, great, pride, in, their, individual, arrays, of, characteristic, flora, which, can, vary, widely, across, the, globe, due, to, differences, in, climate, and, terrain, regional, floras, commonly, are, divided, into, categories, such, as, native, flora, and, agricultural, and, garden, flora, the, lastly, mentioned, of, which, are, intentionally, grown, and, cultivated, some, types, of, native, flora, actually, have, been, introduced, centuries, ago, by, people, migrating, from, one, region, or, continent, to, another, and, become, an, integral, part, of, the, native, or, natural, flora, of, the, place, to, which, they, were, introduced, this, is, an, example, of, how, human, interaction, with, nature, can, blur, the, boundary, of, what, is, considered, nature, another, category, of, plant, has, historically, been, carved, out, for, weeds, though, the, term, has, fallen, into, disfavor, among, botanists, as, a, formal, way, to, categorize, useless, plants, the, informal, use, of, the, word, weeds, to, describe, those, plants, that, are, deemed, worthy, of, elimination, is, illustrative, of, the, general, tendency, of, people, and, societies, to, seek, to, alter, or, shape, the, course, of, nature, similarly, animals, are, often, categorized, in, ways, such, as, domestic, farm, animals, wild, animals, pests, etc, according, to, their, relationship, to, human, life, animals, as, a, category, have, several, characteristics, that, generally, set, them, apart, from, other, living, things, animals, are, eukaryotic, and, usually, multicellular, which, separates, them, from, bacteria, archaea, and, most, protists, they, are, heterotrophic, generally, digesting, food, in, an, internal, chamber, which, separates, them, from, plants, and, algae, they, are, also, distinguished, from, plants, algae, and, fungi, by, lacking, cell, walls, with, a, few, exceptions, most, notably, the, two, phyla, consisting, of, sponges, and, placozoans, animals, have, bodies, that, are, differentiated, into, tissues, these, include, muscles, which, are, able, to, contract, and, control, locomotion, and, a, nervous, system, which, sends, and, processes, signals, there, is, also, typically, an, internal, digestive, chamber, the, eukaryotic, cells, possessed, by, all, animals, are, surrounded, by, a, characteristic, extracellular, matrix, composed, of, collagen, and, elastic, glycoproteins, this, may, be, calcified, to, form, structures, like, shells, bones, and, spicules, a, framework, upon, which, cells, can, move, about, and, be, reorganized, during, development, and, maturation, and, which, supports, the, complex, anatomy, required, for, mobility, although, humans, comprise, only, a, minuscule, proportion, of, the, total, living, biomass, on, earth, the, human, effect, on, nature, is, disproportionately, large, because, of, the, extent, of, human, influence, the, boundaries, between, what, humans, regard, as, nature, and, made, environments, is, not, clear, cut, except, at, the, extremes, even, at, the, extremes, the, amount, of, natural, environment, that, is, free, of, discernible, human, influence, is, diminishing, at, an, increasingly, rapid, pace, a, 2020, study, published, in, nature, found, that, anthropogenic, mass, human, made, materials, outweighs, all, living, biomass, on, earth, with, plastic, alone, exceeding, the, mass, of, all, land, and, marine, animals, combined, and, according, to, a, 2021, study, published, in, frontiers, in, forests, and, global, change, only, about, 3, of, the, planet, s, terrestrial, surface, is, ecologically, and, faunally, intact, with, a, low, human, footprint, and, healthy, populations, of, native, animal, species, philip, cafaro, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, school, of, global, environmental, sustainability, at, colorado, state, university, wrote, in, 2022, that, the, cause, of, global, biodiversity, loss, is, clear, other, species, are, being, displaced, by, a, rapidly, growing, human, economy, the, development, of, technology, by, the, human, race, has, allowed, the, greater, exploitation, of, natural, resources, and, has, helped, to, alleviate, some, of, the, risk, from, natural, hazards, in, spite, of, this, progress, however, the, fate, of, human, civilization, remains, closely, linked, to, changes, in, the, environment, there, exists, a, highly, complex, feedback, loop, between, the, use, of, advanced, technology, and, changes, to, the, environment, that, are, only, slowly, becoming, understood, human, made, threats, to, the, earth, s, natural, environment, include, pollution, deforestation, and, disasters, such, as, oil, spills, humans, have, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, many, plants, and, animals, with, roughly, 1, million, species, threatened, with, extinction, within, decades, the, loss, of, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, functions, over, the, last, half, century, have, impacted, the, extent, that, nature, can, contribute, to, human, quality, of, life, and, continued, declines, could, pose, a, major, threat, to, the, continued, existence, of, human, civilization, unless, a, rapid, course, correction, is, made, the, value, of, natural, resources, to, human, society, is, not, reflected, in, market, prices, because, mostly, natural, resources, are, available, free, of, charge, this, distorts, market, pricing, of, natural, resources, and, at, the, same, time, leads, to, underinvestment, in, our, natural, assets, the, annual, global, cost, of, public, subsidies, that, damage, nature, is, conservatively, estimated, at, 4, 6, trillion, million, million, institutional, protections, of, these, natural, goods, such, as, the, oceans, and, rainforests, are, lacking, governments, have, not, prevented, these, economic, externalities, humans, employ, nature, for, both, leisure, and, economic, activities, the, acquisition, of, natural, resources, for, industrial, use, remains, a, sizable, component, of, the, world, s, economic, system, some, activities, such, as, hunting, and, fishing, are, used, for, both, sustenance, and, leisure, often, by, different, people, agriculture, was, first, adopted, around, the, 9th, millennium, bce, ranging, from, food, production, to, energy, nature, influences, economic, wealth, although, early, humans, gathered, uncultivated, plant, materials, for, food, and, employed, the, medicinal, properties, of, vegetation, for, healing, most, modern, human, use, of, plants, is, through, agriculture, the, clearance, of, large, tracts, of, land, for, crop, growth, has, led, to, a, significant, reduction, in, the, amount, available, of, forestation, and, wetlands, resulting, in, the, loss, of, habitat, for, many, plant, and, animal, species, as, well, as, increased, erosion, beauty, in, nature, has, historically, been, a, prevalent, theme, in, art, and, books, filling, large, sections, of, libraries, and, bookstores, that, nature, has, been, depicted, and, celebrated, by, so, much, art, photography, poetry, and, other, literature, shows, the, strength, with, which, many, people, associate, nature, and, beauty, reasons, why, this, association, exists, and, what, the, association, consists, of, are, studied, by, the, branch, of, philosophy, called, aesthetics, beyond, certain, basic, characteristics, that, many, philosophers, agree, about, to, explain, what, is, seen, as, beautiful, the, opinions, are, virtually, endless, nature, and, wildness, have, been, important, subjects, in, various, eras, of, world, history, an, early, tradition, of, landscape, art, began, in, china, during, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, the, tradition, of, representing, nature, as, it, is, became, one, of, the, aims, of, chinese, painting, and, was, a, significant, influence, in, asian, art, although, natural, wonders, are, celebrated, in, the, psalms, and, the, book, of, job, wilderness, portrayals, in, art, became, more, prevalent, in, the, 1800s, especially, in, the, works, of, the, romantic, movement, british, artists, john, constable, and, j, m, w, turner, turned, their, attention, to, capturing, the, beauty, of, the, natural, world, in, their, paintings, before, that, paintings, had, been, primarily, of, religious, scenes, or, of, human, beings, william, wordsworth, s, poetry, described, the, wonder, of, the, natural, world, which, had, formerly, been, viewed, as, a, threatening, place, increasingly, the, valuing, of, nature, became, an, aspect, of, western, culture, this, artistic, movement, also, coincided, with, the, transcendentalist, movement, in, the, western, world, a, common, classical, idea, of, beautiful, art, involves, the, word, mimesis, the, imitation, of, nature, also, in, the, realm, of, ideas, about, beauty, in, nature, is, that, the, perfect, is, implied, through, perfect, mathematical, forms, and, more, generally, by, patterns, in, nature, as, david, rothenburg, writes, the, beautiful, is, the, root, of, science, and, the, goal, of, art, the, highest, possibility, that, humanity, can, ever, hope, to, see, 281, the, natural, sciences, view, matter, as, obeying, certain, laws, of, nature, which, scientists, seeks, to, understand, matter, is, commonly, defined, as, the, substance, of, which, physical, objects, are, composed, it, constitutes, the, observable, universe, the, visible, components, of, the, universe, are, now, believed, to, compose, only, 4, 9, percent, of, the, total, mass, the, remainder, is, believed, to, consist, of, 26, 8, percent, cold, dark, matter, and, 68, 3, percent, dark, energy, the, exact, arrangement, of, these, components, is, still, unknown, and, is, under, intensive, investigation, by, physicists, the, behaviour, of, matter, and, energy, throughout, the, observable, universe, appears, to, follow, well, defined, physical, laws, these, laws, have, been, employed, to, produce, cosmological, models, that, successfully, explain, the, structure, and, the, evolution, of, the, universe, we, can, observe, the, mathematical, expressions, of, the, laws, of, physics, employ, a, set, of, twenty, physical, constants, that, appear, to, be, static, across, the, observable, universe, the, values, of, these, constants, have, been, carefully, measured, but, the, reason, for, their, specific, values, remains, a, mystery, outer, space, also, simply, called, space, refers, to, the, relatively, empty, regions, of, the, universe, outside, the, atmospheres, of, celestial, bodies, outer, space, is, used, to, distinguish, it, from, airspace, and, terrestrial, locations, there, is, no, discrete, boundary, between, earth, s, atmosphere, and, space, as, the, atmosphere, gradually, attenuates, with, increasing, altitude, outer, space, within, the, solar, system, is, called, interplanetary, space, which, passes, over, into, interstellar, space, at, what, is, known, as, the, heliopause, outer, space, is, sparsely, filled, with, several, dozen, types, of, organic, molecules, discovered, to, date, by, microwave, spectroscopy, blackbody, radiation, left, over, from, the, big, bang, and, the, origin, of, the, universe, and, cosmic, rays, which, include, ionized, atomic, nuclei, and, various, subatomic, particles, there, is, also, some, gas, plasma, and, dust, and, small, meteors, additionally, there, are, signs, of, human, life, in, outer, space, today, such, as, material, left, over, from, previous, crewed, and, uncrewed, launches, which, are, a, potential, hazard, to, spacecraft, some, of, this, debris, re, enters, the, atmosphere, periodically, although, earth, is, the, only, body, within, the, solar, system, known, to, support, life, evidence, suggests, that, in, the, distant, past, the, planet, mars, possessed, bodies, of, liquid, water, on, the, surface, for, a, brief, period, in, mars, history, it, may, have, also, been, capable, of, forming, life, at, present, though, most, of, the, water, remaining, on, mars, is, frozen, if, life, exists, at, all, on, mars, it, is, most, likely, to, be, located, underground, where, liquid, water, can, still, exist, conditions, on, the, other, terrestrial, planets, mercury, and, venus, appear, to, be, too, harsh, to, support, life, as, we, know, it, but, it, has, been, conjectured, that, europa, the, fourth, largest, moon, of, jupiter, may, possess, a, sub, surface, ocean, of, liquid, water, and, could, potentially, host, life, astronomers, have, started, to, discover, extrasolar, earth, analogs, planets, that, lie, in, the, habitable, zone, of, space, surrounding, a, star, and, therefore, could, possibly, host, life, as, we, know, it, media, organizations, philosophy
