velocity, is, the, speed, in, combination, with, the, direction, of, motion, of, an, object, velocity, is, a, fundamental, concept, in, kinematics, the, branch, of, classical, mechanics, that, describes, the, motion, of, bodies, velocity, is, a, physical, vector, quantity, both, magnitude, and, direction, are, needed, to, define, it, the, scalar, absolute, value, magnitude, of, velocity, is, called, speed, being, a, coherent, derived, unit, whose, quantity, is, measured, in, the, si, metric, system, as, metres, per, second, m, s, or, m, s, 1, for, example, 5, metres, per, second, is, a, scalar, whereas, 5, metres, per, second, east, is, a, vector, if, there, is, a, change, in, speed, direction, or, both, then, the, object, is, said, to, be, undergoing, an, acceleration, the, average, velocity, of, an, object, over, a, period, of, time, is, its, change, in, position, s, displaystyle, delta, s, divided, by, the, duration, of, the, period, t, displaystyle, delta, t, given, mathematically, as, v, s, t, displaystyle, bar, v, frac, delta, s, delta, t, the, instantaneous, velocity, of, an, object, is, the, limit, average, velocity, as, the, time, interval, approaches, zero, at, any, particular, time, t, it, can, be, calculated, as, the, derivative, of, the, position, with, respect, to, time, v, lim, t, 0, s, t, d, s, d, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, v, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, boldsymbol, s, delta, t, frac, d, boldsymbol, s, dt, from, this, derivative, equation, in, the, one, dimensional, case, it, can, be, seen, that, the, area, under, a, velocity, vs, time, v, vs, t, graph, is, the, displacement, s, in, calculus, terms, the, integral, of, the, velocity, function, v, t, is, the, displacement, function, s, t, in, the, figure, this, corresponds, to, the, yellow, area, under, the, curve, s, v, d, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, s, int, boldsymbol, v, dt, although, the, concept, of, an, instantaneous, velocity, might, at, first, seem, counter, intuitive, it, may, be, thought, of, as, the, velocity, that, the, object, would, continue, to, travel, at, if, it, stopped, accelerating, at, that, moment, while, the, terms, speed, and, velocity, are, often, colloquially, used, interchangeably, to, connote, how, fast, an, object, is, moving, in, scientific, terms, they, are, different, speed, the, scalar, magnitude, of, a, velocity, vector, denotes, only, how, fast, an, object, is, moving, while, velocity, indicates, both, an, object, s, speed, and, direction, to, have, a, constant, velocity, an, object, must, have, a, constant, speed, in, a, constant, direction, constant, direction, constrains, the, object, to, motion, in, a, straight, path, thus, a, constant, velocity, means, motion, in, a, straight, line, at, a, constant, speed, for, example, a, car, moving, at, a, constant, 20, kilometres, per, hour, in, a, circular, path, has, a, constant, speed, but, does, not, have, a, constant, velocity, because, its, direction, changes, hence, the, car, is, considered, to, be, undergoing, an, acceleration, since, the, derivative, of, the, position, with, respect, to, time, gives, the, change, in, position, in, metres, divided, by, the, change, in, time, in, seconds, velocity, is, measured, in, metres, per, second, m, s, velocity, is, defined, as, the, rate, of, change, of, position, with, respect, to, time, which, may, also, be, referred, to, as, the, instantaneous, velocity, to, emphasize, the, distinction, from, the, average, velocity, in, some, applications, the, average, velocity, of, an, object, might, be, needed, that, is, to, say, the, constant, velocity, that, would, provide, the, same, resultant, displacement, as, a, variable, velocity, in, the, same, time, interval, v, t, over, some, time, period, t, average, velocity, can, be, calculated, as, the, average, velocity, is, always, less, than, or, equal, to, the, average, speed, of, an, object, this, can, be, seen, by, realizing, that, while, distance, is, always, strictly, increasing, displacement, can, increase, or, decrease, in, magnitude, as, well, as, change, direction, in, terms, of, a, displacement, time, x, vs, t, graph, the, instantaneous, velocity, or, simply, velocity, can, be, thought, of, as, the, slope, of, the, tangent, line, to, the, curve, at, any, point, and, the, average, velocity, as, the, slope, of, the, secant, line, between, two, points, with, t, coordinates, equal, to, the, boundaries, of, the, time, period, for, the, average, velocity, if, t, 1, t, 2, t, 3, t, then, average, speed, is, given, by,

the, speeds, v, n, 1, v, 1, 1, v, 2, 1, v, 3, 1, v, n, 1, n, i, 1, n, 1, v, i, 1, displaystyle, bar, v, n, left, 1, over, v, 1, 1, over, v, 2, 1, over, v, 3, dots, 1, over, v, n, right, 1, n, left,

acceleration, as, seen, by, the, three, green, tangent, lines, in, the, figure, an, object, s, instantaneous, acceleration, at, a, point, in, time, is, the, slope, of, the, line, tangent, to, the,

boldsymbol, a, frac, d, boldsymbol, v, dt, from, there, velocity, is, expressed, as, the, area, under, an, a, t, acceleration, vs, time, graph, as, above, this, is, done, using, the, concept, of, the,
