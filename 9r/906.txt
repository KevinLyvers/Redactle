the, photoelectric, effect, is, the, emission, of, electrons, from, a, material, caused, by, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, ultraviolet, light, electrons, emitted, in, this, manner, are, called, photoelectrons, the, phenomenon, is, studied, in, condensed, matter, physics, solid, state, and, quantum, chemistry, to, draw, inferences, about, the, properties, of, atoms, molecules, and, solids, the, effect, has, found, use, in, electronic, devices, specialized, for, light, detection, and, precisely, timed, electron, emission, the, experimental, results, disagree, with, classical, electromagnetism, which, predicts, that, continuous, light, waves, transfer, energy, to, electrons, which, would, then, be, emitted, when, they, accumulate, enough, energy, an, alteration, in, the, intensity, of, light, would, theoretically, change, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, emitted, electrons, with, sufficiently, dim, light, resulting, in, a, delayed, emission, the, experimental, results, instead, show, that, electrons, are, dislodged, only, when, the, light, exceeds, a, certain, frequency, regardless, of, the, light, s, intensity, or, duration, of, exposure, because, a, low, frequency, beam, at, a, high, intensity, does, not, build, up, the, energy, required, to, produce, photoelectrons, as, would, be, the, case, if, light, s, energy, accumulated, over, time, from, a, continuous, wave, albert, einstein, proposed, that, a, beam, of, light, is, not, a, wave, propagating, through, space, but, a, swarm, of, discrete, energy, packets, known, as, photons, term, coined, by, gilbert, n, lewis, in, 1926, emission, of, conduction, electrons, from, typical, metals, requires, a, few, electron, volt, ev, light, quanta, corresponding, to, short, wavelength, visible, or, ultraviolet, light, in, extreme, cases, emissions, are, induced, with, photons, approaching, zero, energy, like, in, systems, with, negative, electron, affinity, and, the, emission, from, excited, states, or, a, few, hundred, kev, photons, for, core, electrons, in, elements, with, a, high, atomic, number, study, of, the, photoelectric, effect, led, to, important, steps, in, understanding, the, quantum, nature, of, light, and, electrons, and, influenced, the, formation, of, the, concept, of, wave, particle, duality, other, phenomena, where, light, affects, the, movement, of, electric, charges, include, the, photoconductive, effect, the, photovoltaic, effect, and, the, photoelectrochemical, effect, the, photons, of, a, light, beam, have, a, characteristic, energy, called, photon, energy, which, is, proportional, to, the, frequency, of, the, light, in, the, photoemission, process, when, an, electron, within, some, material, absorbs, the, energy, of, a, photon, and, acquires, more, energy, than, its, binding, energy, it, is, likely, to, be, ejected, if, the, photon, energy, is, too, low, the, electron, is, unable, to, escape, the, material, since, an, increase, in, the, intensity, of, low, frequency, light, will, only, increase, the, number, of, low, energy, photons, this, change, in, intensity, will, not, create, any, single, photon, with, enough, energy, to, dislodge, an, electron, moreover, the, energy, of, the, emitted, electrons, will, not, depend, on, the, intensity, of, the, incoming, light, of, a, given, frequency, but, only, on, the, energy, of, the, individual, photons, while, free, electrons, can, absorb, any, energy, when, irradiated, as, long, as, this, is, followed, by, an, immediate, re, emission, like, in, the, compton, effect, in, quantum, systems, all, of, the, energy, from, one, photon, is, absorbed, if, the, process, is, allowed, by, quantum, mechanics, or, none, at, all, part, of, the, acquired, energy, is, used, to, liberate, the, electron, from, its, atomic, binding, and, the, rest, contributes, to, the, electron, s, kinetic, energy, as, a, free, particle, because, electrons, in, a, material, occupy, many, different, quantum, states, with, different, binding, energies, and, because, they, can, sustain, energy, losses, on, their, way, out, of, the, material, the, emitted, electrons, will, have, a, range, of, kinetic, energies, the, electrons, from, the, highest, occupied, states, will, have, the, highest, kinetic, energy, in, metals, those, electrons, will, be, emitted, from, the, fermi, level, when, the, photoelectron, is, emitted, into, a, solid, rather, than, into, a, vacuum, the, term, internal, photoemission, is, often, used, and, emission, into, a, vacuum, is, distinguished, as, external, photoemission, even, though, photoemission, can, occur, from, any, material, it, is, most, readily, observed, from, metals, and, other, conductors, this, is, because, the, process, produces, a, charge, imbalance, which, if, not, neutralized, by, current, flow, results, in, the, increasing, potential, barrier, until, the, emission, completely, ceases, the, energy, barrier, to, photoemission, is, usually, increased, by, nonconductive, oxide, layers, on, metal, surfaces, so, most, practical, experiments, and, devices, based, on, the, photoelectric, effect, use, clean, metal, surfaces, in, evacuated, tubes, vacuum, also, helps, observing, the, electrons, since, it, prevents, gases, from, impeding, their, flow, between, the, electrodes, as, sunlight, due, to, atmosphere, s, absorption, does, not, provide, much, ultraviolet, light, the, light, rich, in, ultraviolet, rays, used, to, be, obtained, by, burning, magnesium, or, from, an, arc, lamp, at, the, present, time, mercury, vapor, lamps, noble, gas, discharge, uv, lamps, and, radio, frequency, plasma, sources, ultraviolet, lasers, and, synchrotron, insertion, device, light, sources, prevail, the, classical, setup, to, observe, the, photoelectric, effect, includes, a, light, source, a, set, of, filters, to, monochromatize, the, light, a, vacuum, tube, transparent, to, ultraviolet, light, an, emitting, electrode, e, exposed, to, the, light, and, a, collector, c, whose, voltage, v, c, can, be, externally, controlled, a, positive, external, voltage, is, used, to, direct, the, photoemitted, electrons, onto, the, collector, if, the, frequency, and, the, intensity, of, the, incident, radiation, are, fixed, the, photoelectric, current, i, increases, with, an, increase, in, the, positive, voltage, as, more, and, more, electrons, are, directed, onto, the, electrode, when, no, additional, photoelectrons, can, be, collected, the, photoelectric, current, attains, a, saturation, value, this, current, can, only, increase, with, the, increase, of, the, intensity, of, light, an, increasing, negative, voltage, prevents, all, but, the, highest, energy, electrons, from, reaching, the, collector, when, no, current, is, observed, through, the, tube, the, negative, voltage, has, reached, the, value, that, is, high, enough, to, slow, down, and, stop, the, most, energetic, photoelectrons, of, kinetic, energy, k, max, this, value, of, the, retarding, voltage, is, called, the, stopping, potential, or, cut, off, potential, v, o, since, the, work, done, by, the, retarding, potential, in, stopping, the, electron, of, charge, e, is, ev, o, the, following, must, hold, ev, o, k, max, the, current, voltage, curve, is, sigmoidal, but, its, exact, shape, depends, on, the, experimental, geometry, and, the, electrode, material, properties, for, a, given, metal, surface, there, exists, a, certain, minimum, frequency, of, incident, radiation, below, which, no, photoelectrons, are, emitted, this, frequency, is, called, the, threshold, frequency, increasing, the, frequency, of, the, incident, beam, increases, the, maximum, kinetic, energy, of, the, emitted, photoelectrons, and, the, stopping, voltage, has, to, increase, the, number, of, emitted, electrons, may, also, change, because, the, probability, that, each, photon, results, in, an, emitted, electron, is, a, function, of, photon, energy, an, increase, in, the, intensity, of, the, same, monochromatic, light, so, long, as, the, intensity, is, not, too, high, which, is, proportional, to, the, number, of, photons, impinging, on, the, surface, in, a, given, time, increases, the, rate, at, which, electrons, are, ejected, the, photoelectric, current, i, but, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, photoelectrons, and, the, stopping, voltage, remain, the, same, for, a, given, metal, and, frequency, of, incident, radiation, the, rate, at, which, photoelectrons, are, ejected, is, directly, proportional, to, the, intensity, of, the, incident, light, the, time, lag, between, the, incidence, of, radiation, and, the, emission, of, a, photoelectron, is, very, small, less, than, 10, 9, second, angular, distribution, of, the, photoelectrons, is, highly, dependent, on, polarization, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, of, the, incident, light, as, well, as, the, emitting, material, s, quantum, properties, such, as, atomic, and, molecular, orbital, symmetries, and, the, electronic, band, structure, of, crystalline, solids, in, materials, without, macroscopic, order, the, distribution, of, electrons, tends, to, peak, in, the, direction, of, polarization, of, linearly, polarized, light, the, experimental, technique, that, can, measure, these, distributions, to, infer, the, material, s, properties, is, angle, resolved, photoemission, spectroscopy, in, 1905, einstein, proposed, a, theory, of, the, photoelectric, effect, using, a, concept, that, light, consists, of, tiny, packets, of, energy, known, as, photons, or, light, quanta, each, packet, carries, energy, h, displaystyle, h, nu, that, is, proportional, to, the, frequency, displaystyle, nu, of, the, corresponding, electromagnetic, wave, the, proportionality, constant, h, displaystyle, h, has, become, known, as, the, planck, constant, in, the, range, of, kinetic, energies, of, the, electrons, that, are, removed, from, their, varying, atomic, bindings, by, the, absorption, of, a, photon, of, energy, h, displaystyle, h, nu, the, highest, kinetic, energy, k, max, displaystyle, k, max, is, k, max, h, w, displaystyle, k, max, h, nu, w, here, w, displaystyle, w, is, the, minimum, energy, required, to, remove, an, electron, from, the, surface, of, the, material, it, is, called, the, work, function, of, the, surface, and, is, sometimes, denoted, displaystyle, phi, or, displaystyle, varphi, if, the, work, function, is, written, as, w, h, o, displaystyle, w, h, nu, o, the, formula, for, the, maximum, kinetic, energy, of, the, ejected, electrons, becomes, k, max, h, o, displaystyle, k, max, h, left, nu, nu, o, right, kinetic, energy, is, positive, and, o, displaystyle, nu, nu, o, is, required, for, the, photoelectric, effect, to, occur, the, frequency, o, displaystyle, nu, o, is, the, threshold, frequency, for, the, given, material, above, that, frequency, the, maximum, kinetic, energy, of, the, photoelectrons, as, well, as, the, stopping, voltage, in, the, experiment, v, o, h, e, o, textstyle, v, o, frac, h, e, left, nu, nu, o, right, rise, linearly, with, the, frequency, and, have, no, dependence, on, the, number, of, photons, and, the, intensity, of, the, impinging, monochromatic, light, einstein, s, formula, however, simple, explained, all, the, phenomenology, of, the, photoelectric, effect, and, had, far, reaching, consequences, in, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, electrons, that, are, bound, in, atoms, molecules, and, solids, each, occupy, distinct, states, of, well, defined, binding, energies, when, light, quanta, deliver, more, than, this, amount, of, energy, to, an, individual, electron, the, electron, may, be, emitted, into, free, space, with, excess, kinetic, energy, that, is, h, displaystyle, h, nu, higher, than, the, electron, s, binding, energy, the, distribution, of, kinetic, energies, thus, reflects, the, distribution, of, the, binding, energies, of, the, electrons, in, the, atomic, molecular, or, crystalline, system, an, electron, emitted, from, the, state, at, binding, energy, e, b, displaystyle, e, b, is, found, at, kinetic, energy, e, k, h, e, b, displaystyle, e, k, h, nu, e, b, this, distribution, is, one, of, the, main, characteristics, of, the, quantum, system, and, can, be, used, for, further, studies, in, quantum, chemistry, and, quantum, physics, the, electronic, properties, of, ordered, crystalline, solids, are, determined, by, the, distribution, of, the, electronic, states, with, respect, to, energy, and, momentum, the, electronic, band, structure, of, the, solid, theoretical, models, of, photoemission, from, solids, show, that, this, distribution, is, for, the, most, part, preserved, in, the, photoelectric, effect, the, phenomenological, three, step, model, for, ultraviolet, and, soft, x, ray, excitation, decomposes, the, effect, into, these, steps, there, are, cases, where, the, three, step, model, fails, to, explain, peculiarities, of, the, photoelectron, intensity, distributions, the, more, elaborate, one, step, model, treats, the, effect, as, a, coherent, process, of, photoexcitation, into, the, final, state, of, a, finite, crystal, for, which, the, wave, function, is, free, electron, like, outside, of, the, crystal, but, has, a, decaying, envelope, inside, in, 1839, alexandre, edmond, becquerel, discovered, the, related, photovoltaic, effect, while, studying, the, effect, of, light, on, electrolytic, cells, though, not, equivalent, to, the, photoelectric, effect, his, work, on, photovoltaics, was, instrumental, in, showing, a, strong, relationship, between, light, and, electronic, properties, of, materials, in, 1873, willoughby, smith, discovered, photoconductivity, in, selenium, while, testing, the, metal, for, its, high, resistance, properties, in, conjunction, with, his, work, involving, submarine, telegraph, cables, johann, elster, 1854, 1920, and, hans, geitel, 1855, 1923, students, in, heidelberg, investigated, the, effects, produced, by, light, on, electrified, bodies, and, developed, the, first, practical, photoelectric, cells, that, could, be, used, to, measure, the, intensity, of, light, 458, they, arranged, metals, with, respect, to, their, power, of, discharging, negative, electricity, rubidium, potassium, alloy, of, potassium, and, sodium, sodium, lithium, magnesium, thallium, and, zinc, for, copper, platinum, lead, iron, cadmium, carbon, and, mercury, the, effects, with, ordinary, light, were, too, small, to, be, measurable, the, order, of, the, metals, for, this, effect, was, the, same, as, in, volta, s, series, for, contact, electricity, the, most, electropositive, metals, giving, the, largest, photo, electric, effect, in, 1887, heinrich, hertz, observed, the, photoelectric, effect, and, reported, on, the, production, and, reception, of, electromagnetic, waves, the, receiver, in, his, apparatus, consisted, of, a, coil, with, a, spark, gap, where, a, spark, would, be, seen, upon, detection, of, electromagnetic, waves, he, placed, the, apparatus, in, a, darkened, box, to, see, the, spark, better, however, he, noticed, that, the, maximum, spark, length, was, reduced, when, inside, the, box, a, glass, panel, placed, between, the, source, of, electromagnetic, waves, and, the, receiver, absorbed, ultraviolet, radiation, that, assisted, the, electrons, in, jumping, across, the, gap, when, removed, the, spark, length, would, increase, he, observed, no, decrease, in, spark, length, when, he, replaced, the, glass, with, quartz, as, quartz, does, not, absorb, uv, radiation, the, discoveries, by, hertz, led, to, a, series, of, investigations, by, wilhelm, hallwachs, hoor, augusto, righi, and, aleksander, stoletov, on, the, effect, of, light, and, especially, of, ultraviolet, light, on, charged, bodies, hallwachs, connected, a, zinc, plate, to, an, electroscope, he, allowed, ultraviolet, light, to, fall, on, a, freshly, cleaned, zinc, plate, and, observed, that, the, zinc, plate, became, uncharged, if, initially, negatively, charged, positively, charged, if, initially, uncharged, and, more, positively, charged, if, initially, positively, charged, from, these, observations, he, concluded, that, some, negatively, charged, particles, were, emitted, by, the, zinc, plate, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, with, regard, to, the, hertz, effect, the, researchers, from, the, start, showed, the, complexity, of, the, phenomenon, of, photoelectric, fatigue, the, progressive, diminution, of, the, effect, observed, upon, fresh, metallic, surfaces, according, to, hallwachs, ozone, played, an, important, part, in, the, phenomenon, and, the, emission, was, influenced, by, oxidation, humidity, and, the, degree, of, polishing, of, the, surface, it, was, at, the, time, unclear, whether, fatigue, is, absent, in, a, vacuum, in, the, period, from, 1888, until, 1891, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, photoeffect, was, performed, by, aleksandr, stoletov, with, results, reported, in, six, publications, stoletov, invented, a, new, experimental, setup, which, was, more, suitable, for, a, quantitative, analysis, of, the, photoeffect, he, discovered, a, direct, proportionality, between, the, intensity, of, light, and, the, induced, photoelectric, current, the, first, law, of, photoeffect, or, stoletov, s, law, he, measured, the, dependence, of, the, intensity, of, the, photo, electric, current, on, the, gas, pressure, where, he, found, the, existence, of, an, optimal, gas, pressure, corresponding, to, a, maximum, photocurrent, this, property, was, used, for, the, creation, of, solar, cells, many, substances, besides, metals, discharge, negative, electricity, under, the, action, of, ultraviolet, light, g, c, schmidt, and, o, knoblauch, compiled, a, list, of, these, substances, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, investigated, ultraviolet, light, in, crookes, tubes, thomson, deduced, that, the, ejected, particles, which, he, called, corpuscles, were, of, the, same, nature, as, cathode, rays, these, particles, later, became, known, as, the, electrons, thomson, enclosed, a, metal, plate, a, cathode, in, a, vacuum, tube, and, exposed, it, to, high, frequency, radiation, it, was, thought, that, the, oscillating, electromagnetic, fields, caused, the, atoms, field, to, resonate, and, after, reaching, a, certain, amplitude, caused, subatomic, corpuscles, to, be, emitted, and, current, to, be, detected, the, amount, of, this, current, varied, with, the, intensity, and, color, of, the, radiation, larger, radiation, intensity, or, frequency, would, produce, more, current, during, the, years, 1886, 1902, wilhelm, hallwachs, and, philipp, lenard, investigated, the, phenomenon, of, photoelectric, emission, in, detail, lenard, observed, that, a, current, flows, through, an, evacuated, glass, tube, enclosing, two, electrodes, when, ultraviolet, radiation, falls, on, one, of, them, as, soon, as, ultraviolet, radiation, is, stopped, the, current, also, stops, this, initiated, the, concept, of, photoelectric, emission, the, discovery, of, the, ionization, of, gases, by, ultraviolet, light, was, made, by, philipp, lenard, in, 1900, as, the, effect, was, produced, across, several, centimeters, of, air, and, yielded, a, greater, number, of, positive, ions, than, negative, it, was, natural, to, interpret, the, phenomenon, as, j, j, thomson, did, as, a, hertz, effect, upon, the, particles, present, in, the, gas, in, 1902, lenard, observed, that, the, energy, of, individual, emitted, electrons, was, independent, of, the, applied, light, intensity, this, appeared, to, be, at, odds, with, maxwell, s, wave, theory, of, light, which, predicted, that, the, electron, energy, would, be, proportional, to, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, lenard, observed, the, variation, in, electron, energy, with, light, frequency, using, a, powerful, electric, arc, lamp, which, enabled, him, to, investigate, large, changes, in, intensity, however, lenard, s, results, were, qualitative, rather, than, quantitative, because, of, the, difficulty, in, performing, the, experiments, the, experiments, needed, to, be, done, on, freshly, cut, metal, so, that, the, pure, metal, was, observed, but, it, oxidized, in, a, matter, of, minutes, even, in, the, partial, vacuums, he, used, the, current, emitted, by, the, surface, was, determined, by, the, light, s, intensity, or, brightness, doubling, the, intensity, of, the, light, doubled, the, number, of, electrons, emitted, from, the, surface, initial, investigation, of, the, photoelectric, effect, in, gasses, by, lenard, were, followed, up, by, j, j, thomson, and, then, more, decisively, by, frederic, palmer, jr, the, gas, photoemission, was, studied, and, showed, very, different, characteristics, than, those, at, first, attributed, to, it, by, lenard, in, 1900, while, studying, black, body, radiation, the, german, physicist, max, planck, suggested, in, his, on, the, law, of, distribution, of, energy, in, the, normal, spectrum, paper, that, the, energy, carried, by, electromagnetic, waves, could, only, be, released, in, packets, of, energy, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, a, paper, advancing, the, hypothesis, that, light, energy, is, carried, in, discrete, quantized, packets, to, explain, experimental, data, from, the, photoelectric, effect, einstein, theorized, that, the, energy, in, each, quantum, of, light, was, equal, to, the, frequency, of, light, multiplied, by, a, constant, later, called, the, planck, constant, a, photon, above, a, threshold, frequency, has, the, required, energy, to, eject, a, single, electron, creating, the, observed, effect, this, was, a, step, in, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 1914, robert, a, millikan, s, highly, accurate, measurements, of, the, planck, constant, from, the, photoelectric, effect, supported, einstein, s, model, even, though, a, corpuscular, theory, of, light, was, for, millikan, at, the, time, quite, unthinkable, einstein, was, awarded, the, 1921, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, discovery, of, the, law, of, the, photoelectric, effect, and, millikan, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1923, for, his, work, on, the, elementary, charge, of, electricity, and, on, the, photoelectric, effect, in, quantum, perturbation, theory, of, atoms, and, solids, acted, upon, by, electromagnetic, radiation, the, photoelectric, effect, is, still, commonly, analyzed, in, terms, of, waves, the, two, approaches, are, equivalent, because, photon, or, wave, absorption, can, only, happen, between, quantized, energy, levels, whose, energy, difference, is, that, of, the, energy, of, photon, albert, einstein, s, mathematical, description, of, how, the, photoelectric, effect, was, caused, by, absorption, of, quanta, of, light, was, in, one, of, his, annus, mirabilis, papers, named, on, a, heuristic, viewpoint, concerning, the, production, and, transformation, of, light, the, paper, proposed, a, simple, description, of, energy, quanta, and, showed, how, they, explained, the, blackbody, radiation, spectrum, his, explanation, in, terms, of, absorption, of, discrete, quanta, of, light, agreed, with, experimental, results, it, explained, why, the, energy, of, photoelectrons, was, not, dependent, on, incident, light, intensity, this, was, a, theoretical, leap, but, the, concept, was, strongly, resisted, at, first, because, it, contradicted, the, wave, theory, of, light, that, followed, naturally, from, james, clerk, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, and, more, generally, the, assumption, of, infinite, divisibility, of, energy, in, physical, systems, einstein, s, work, predicted, that, the, energy, of, individual, ejected, electrons, increases, linearly, with, the, frequency, of, the, light, the, precise, relationship, had, not, at, that, time, been, tested, by, 1905, it, was, known, that, the, energy, of, photoelectrons, increases, with, increasing, frequency, of, incident, light, and, is, independent, of, the, intensity, of, the, light, however, the, manner, of, the, increase, was, not, experimentally, determined, until, 1914, when, millikan, showed, that, einstein, s, prediction, was, correct, the, photoelectric, effect, helped, to, propel, the, then, emerging, concept, of, wave, particle, duality, in, the, nature, of, light, light, simultaneously, possesses, the, characteristics, of, both, waves, and, particles, each, being, manifested, according, to, the, circumstances, the, effect, was, impossible, to, understand, in, terms, of, the, classical, wave, description, of, light, as, the, energy, of, the, emitted, electrons, did, not, depend, on, the, intensity, of, the, incident, radiation, classical, theory, predicted, that, the, electrons, would, gather, up, energy, over, a, period, of, time, and, then, be, emitted, these, are, extremely, light, sensitive, vacuum, tubes, with, a, coated, photocathode, inside, the, envelope, the, photo, cathode, contains, combinations, of, materials, such, as, cesium, rubidium, and, antimony, specially, selected, to, provide, a, low, work, function, so, when, illuminated, even, by, very, low, levels, of, light, the, photocathode, readily, releases, electrons, by, means, of, a, series, of, electrodes, dynodes, at, ever, higher, potentials, these, electrons, are, accelerated, and, substantially, increased, in, number, through, secondary, emission, to, provide, a, readily, detectable, output, current, photomultipliers, are, still, commonly, used, wherever, low, levels, of, light, must, be, detected, video, camera, tubes, in, the, early, days, of, television, used, the, photoelectric, effect, for, example, philo, farnsworth, s, image, dissector, used, a, screen, charged, by, the, photoelectric, effect, to, transform, an, optical, image, into, a, scanned, electronic, signal, because, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, emitted, electrons, is, exactly, the, energy, of, the, incident, photon, minus, the, energy, of, the, electron, s, binding, within, an, atom, molecule, or, solid, the, binding, energy, can, be, determined, by, shining, a, monochromatic, x, ray, or, uv, light, of, a, known, energy, and, measuring, the, kinetic, energies, of, the, photoelectrons, the, distribution, of, electron, energies, is, valuable, for, studying, quantum, properties, of, these, systems, it, can, also, be, used, to, determine, the, elemental, composition, of, the, samples, for, solids, the, kinetic, energy, and, emission, angle, distribution, of, the, photoelectrons, is, measured, for, the, complete, determination, of, the, electronic, band, structure, in, terms, of, the, allowed, binding, energies, and, momenta, of, the, electrons, modern, instruments, for, angle, resolved, photoemission, spectroscopy, are, capable, of, measuring, these, quantities, with, a, precision, better, than, 1, mev, and, 0, 1, photoelectron, spectroscopy, measurements, are, usually, performed, in, a, high, vacuum, environment, because, the, electrons, would, be, scattered, by, gas, molecules, if, they, were, present, however, some, companies, are, now, selling, products, that, allow, photoemission, in, air, the, light, source, can, be, a, laser, a, discharge, tube, or, a, synchrotron, radiation, source, the, concentric, hemispherical, analyzer, is, a, typical, electron, energy, analyzer, it, uses, an, electric, field, between, two, hemispheres, to, change, disperse, the, trajectories, of, incident, electrons, depending, on, their, kinetic, energies, photons, hitting, a, thin, film, of, alkali, metal, or, semiconductor, material, such, as, gallium, arsenide, in, an, image, intensifier, tube, cause, the, ejection, of, photoelectrons, due, to, the, photoelectric, effect, these, are, accelerated, by, an, electrostatic, field, where, they, strike, a, phosphor, coated, screen, converting, the, electrons, back, into, photons, intensification, of, the, signal, is, achieved, either, through, acceleration, of, the, electrons, or, by, increasing, the, number, of, electrons, through, secondary, emissions, such, as, with, a, micro, channel, plate, sometimes, a, combination, of, both, methods, is, used, additional, kinetic, energy, is, required, to, move, an, electron, out, of, the, conduction, band, and, into, the, vacuum, level, this, is, known, as, the, electron, affinity, of, the, photocathode, and, is, another, barrier, to, photoemission, other, than, the, forbidden, band, explained, by, the, band, gap, model, some, materials, such, as, gallium, arsenide, have, an, effective, electron, affinity, that, is, below, the, level, of, the, conduction, band, in, these, materials, electrons, that, move, to, the, conduction, band, all, have, sufficient, energy, to, be, emitted, from, the, material, so, the, film, that, absorbs, photons, can, be, quite, thick, these, materials, are, known, as, negative, electron, affinity, materials, the, photoelectric, effect, will, cause, spacecraft, exposed, to, sunlight, to, develop, a, positive, charge, this, can, be, a, major, problem, as, other, parts, of, the, spacecraft, are, in, shadow, which, will, result, in, the, spacecraft, developing, a, negative, charge, from, nearby, plasmas, the, imbalance, can, discharge, through, delicate, electrical, components, the, static, charge, created, by, the, photoelectric, effect, is, self, limiting, because, a, higher, charged, object, does, not, give, up, its, electrons, as, easily, as, a, lower, charged, object, does, light, from, the, sun, hitting, lunar, dust, causes, it, to, become, positively, charged, from, the, photoelectric, effect, the, charged, dust, then, repels, itself, and, lifts, off, the, surface, of, the, moon, by, electrostatic, levitation, this, manifests, itself, almost, like, an, atmosphere, of, dust, visible, as, a, thin, haze, and, blurring, of, distant, features, and, visible, as, a, dim, glow, after, the, sun, has, set, this, was, first, photographed, by, the, surveyor, program, probes, in, the, 1960s, and, most, recently, the, chang, e, 3, rover, observed, dust, deposition, on, lunar, rocks, as, high, as, about, 28, cm, it, is, thought, that, the, smallest, particles, are, repelled, kilometers, from, the, surface, and, that, the, particles, move, in, fountains, as, they, charge, and, discharge, when, photon, energies, are, as, high, as, the, electron, rest, energy, of, 511, kev, yet, another, process, compton, scattering, may, occur, above, twice, this, energy, at, 1, 022, mev, pair, production, is, also, more, likely, compton, scattering, and, pair, production, are, examples, of, two, other, competing, mechanisms, even, if, the, photoelectric, effect, is, the, favoured, reaction, for, a, particular, interaction, of, a, single, photon, with, a, bound, electron, the, result, is, also, subject, to, quantum, statistics, and, is, not, guaranteed, the, probability, of, the, photoelectric, effect, occurring, is, measured, by, the, cross, section, of, the, interaction, this, has, been, found, to, be, a, function, of, the, atomic, number, of, the, target, atom, and, photon, energy, in, a, crude, approximation, for, photon, energies, above, the, highest, atomic, binding, energy, the, cross, section, is, given, by, here, z, is, the, atomic, number, and, n, is, a, number, which, varies, between, 4, and, 5, the, photoelectric, effect, rapidly, decreases, in, significance, in, the, gamma, ray, region, of, the, spectrum, with, increasing, photon, energy, it, is, also, more, likely, from, elements, with, high, atomic, number, consequently, high, z, materials, make, good, gamma, ray, shields, which, is, the, principal, reason, why, lead, z, 82, is, preferred, and, most, widely, used, applets
