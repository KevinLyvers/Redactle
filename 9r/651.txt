an, atoll, t, l, l, o, l, t, l, t, l, t, o, l, is, a, ring, shaped, island, including, a, coral, rim, that, encircles, a, lagoon, there, may, be, coral, islands, or, cays, on, the, rim, 60, atolls, are, located, in, warm, tropical, or, subtropical, parts, of, the, oceans, and, seas, where, corals, can, develop, most, of, the, approximately, 440, atolls, in, the, world, are, in, the, pacific, ocean, two, different, well, cited, models, the, subsidence, model, and, the, antecedent, karst, model, have, been, used, to, explain, the, development, of, atolls, according, to, charles, darwin, s, subsidence, model, the, formation, of, an, atoll, is, explained, by, the, sinking, of, a, volcanic, island, around, which, a, coral, fringing, reef, has, formed, over, geologic, time, the, volcanic, island, becomes, extinct, and, eroded, as, it, subsides, completely, beneath, the, surface, of, the, ocean, as, the, volcanic, island, subsides, the, coral, fringing, reef, becomes, a, barrier, reef, that, is, detached, from, the, island, eventually, reef, and, the, small, coral, islets, on, top, of, it, are, all, that, is, left, of, the, original, island, and, a, lagoon, has, taken, the, place, of, the, former, volcano, the, lagoon, is, not, the, former, volcanic, crater, for, the, atoll, to, persist, the, coral, reef, must, be, maintained, at, the, sea, surface, with, coral, growth, matching, any, relative, change, in, sea, level, sinking, of, the, island, or, rising, oceans, an, alternative, model, for, the, origin, of, atolls, is, called, the, antecedent, karst, model, in, the, antecedent, karst, model, the, first, step, in, the, formation, of, an, atoll, is, the, development, of, a, flat, top, mound, like, coral, reef, during, the, subsidence, of, an, oceanic, island, of, either, volcanic, or, nonvolcanic, origin, below, sea, level, then, when, relative, sea, level, drops, below, the, level, of, the, flat, surface, of, coral, reef, it, is, exposed, to, the, atmosphere, as, a, flat, topped, island, which, is, dissolved, by, rainfall, to, form, limestone, karst, because, of, hydrologic, properties, of, this, karst, the, rate, of, dissolution, of, the, exposed, coral, is, lowest, along, its, rim, and, the, rate, of, dissolution, increases, inward, to, its, maximum, at, the, center, of, the, island, as, a, result, a, saucer, shaped, island, with, a, raised, rim, forms, when, relative, sea, level, submerges, the, island, again, the, rim, provides, a, rocky, core, on, which, coral, grow, again, to, form, the, islands, of, an, atoll, and, the, flooded, bottom, of, the, saucer, forms, the, lagoon, within, them, the, word, atoll, comes, from, the, dhivehi, word, atholhu, pronounced, dhivehi, is, an, indo, aryan, language, spoken, in, the, maldives, the, word, s, first, recorded, english, use, was, in, 1625, as, atollon, charles, darwin, coined, the, term, in, his, monograph, the, structure, and, distribution, of, coral, reefs, he, recognized, the, word, s, indigenous, origin, and, defined, it, as, a, circular, group, of, coral, islets, synonymously, with, lagoon, island, 2, more, modern, definitions, of, atoll, describe, them, as, annular, reefs, enclosing, a, lagoon, in, which, there, are, no, promontories, other, than, reefs, and, islets, composed, of, reef, detritus, or, in, an, exclusively, morphological, sense, a, ring, shaped, ribbon, reef, enclosing, a, lagoon, there, are, approximately, 440, atolls, in, the, world, most, of, the, world, s, atolls, are, in, the, pacific, ocean, with, concentrations, in, the, caroline, islands, the, coral, sea, islands, the, marshall, islands, the, tuamotu, islands, kiribati, tokelau, and, tuvalu, and, the, indian, ocean, the, chagos, archipelago, lakshadweep, the, atolls, of, the, maldives, and, the, outer, islands, of, seychelles, the, atlantic, ocean, has, no, large, groups, of, atolls, other, than, eight, atolls, east, of, nicaragua, that, belong, to, the, colombian, department, of, san, andres, and, providencia, in, the, caribbean, reef, building, corals, will, thrive, only, in, warm, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, of, oceans, and, seas, and, therefore, atolls, are, found, only, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, the, northernmost, atoll, in, the, world, is, kure, atoll, at, 28, 25, n, along, with, other, atolls, of, the, northwestern, hawaiian, islands, the, southernmost, atolls, in, the, world, are, elizabeth, reef, at, 29, 57, s, and, nearby, middleton, reef, at, 29, 27, s, in, the, tasman, sea, both, of, which, are, part, of, the, coral, sea, islands, territory, the, next, southerly, atoll, is, ducie, island, in, the, pitcairn, islands, group, at, 24, 41, s, the, atoll, closest, to, the, equator, is, aranuka, of, kiribati, its, southern, tip, is, just, 13, km, 8, mi, north, of, the, equator, bermuda, is, sometimes, claimed, as, the, northernmost, atoll, at, a, latitude, of, 32, 18, n, at, this, latitude, coral, reefs, would, not, develop, without, the, warming, waters, of, the, gulf, stream, however, bermuda, is, termed, a, pseudo, atoll, because, its, general, form, while, resembling, that, of, an, atoll, has, a, very, different, origin, of, formation, in, most, cases, the, land, area, of, an, atoll, is, very, small, in, comparison, to, the, total, area, atoll, islands, are, low, lying, with, their, elevations, less, than, 5, metres, 16, ft, measured, by, total, area, lifou, 1, 146, km, 2, 442, sq, mi, is, the, largest, raised, coral, atoll, of, the, world, followed, by, rennell, island, 660, km, 2, 250, sq, mi, more, sources, however, list, kiritimati, as, the, largest, atoll, in, the, world, in, terms, of, land, area, it, is, also, a, raised, coral, atoll, 321, km, 2, 124, sq, mi, land, area, according, to, other, sources, even, 575, km, 2, 222, sq, mi, 160, km, 2, 62, sq, mi, main, lagoon, 168, km, 2, 65, sq, mi, other, lagoons, according, to, other, sources, 319, km, 2, 123, sq, mi, total, lagoon, size, the, geological, formation, known, as, a, reef, knoll, refers, to, the, elevated, remains, of, an, ancient, atoll, within, a, limestone, region, appearing, as, a, hill, the, second, largest, atoll, by, dry, land, area, is, aldabra, with, 155, km, 2, 60, sq, mi, huvadhu, atoll, situated, in, the, southern, region, of, the, maldives, holds, the, distinction, of, being, the, largest, atoll, based, on, the, sheer, number, of, islands, it, comprises, with, a, total, of, 255, individual, islands, in, 1842, charles, darwin, explained, the, creation, of, coral, atolls, in, the, southern, pacific, ocean, based, upon, observations, made, during, a, five, year, voyage, aboard, hms, beagle, from, 1831, to, 1836, darwin, s, explanation, suggests, that, several, tropical, island, types, from, high, volcanic, island, through, barrier, reef, island, to, atoll, represented, a, sequence, of, gradual, subsidence, of, what, started, as, an, oceanic, volcano, he, reasoned, that, a, fringing, coral, reef, surrounding, a, volcanic, island, in, the, tropical, sea, will, grow, upward, as, the, island, subsides, sinks, becoming, an, almost, atoll, or, barrier, reef, island, as, typified, by, an, island, such, as, aitutaki, in, the, cook, islands, and, bora, bora, and, others, in, the, society, islands, the, fringing, reef, becomes, a, barrier, reef, for, the, reason, that, the, outer, part, of, the, reef, maintains, itself, near, sea, level, through, biotic, growth, while, the, inner, part, of, the, reef, falls, behind, becoming, a, lagoon, because, conditions, are, less, favorable, for, the, coral, and, calcareous, algae, responsible, for, most, reef, growth, in, time, subsidence, carries, the, old, volcano, below, the, ocean, surface, and, the, barrier, reef, remains, at, this, point, the, island, has, become, an, atoll, as, formulated, by, j, e, hoffmeister, f, s, mcneil, e, g, prudy, and, others, the, antecedent, karst, model, argues, that, atolls, are, pleistocene, features, that, are, the, direct, result, of, the, interaction, between, subsidence, and, preferential, karst, dissolution, that, occurred, in, the, interior, of, flat, topped, coral, reefs, during, exposure, during, glacial, lowstands, of, sea, level, the, elevated, rims, along, an, island, created, by, this, preferential, karst, dissolution, become, the, sites, of, coral, growth, and, islands, of, atolls, when, flooded, during, interglacial, highstands, the, research, of, a, w, droxler, and, others, supports, the, antecedent, karst, model, as, they, found, that, the, morphology, of, modern, atolls, are, independent, of, any, influence, of, an, underlying, submerged, and, buried, island, and, are, not, rooted, to, an, initial, fringing, reef, barrier, reef, attached, to, a, slowly, subsiding, volcanic, edifice, in, fact, the, neogene, reefs, underlying, the, studied, modern, atolls, overlie, and, completely, bury, the, subsided, island, are, all, non, atoll, flat, topped, reefs, in, fact, they, found, that, atolls, did, not, form, doing, the, subsidence, of, an, island, until, mis, 11, mid, brunhes, long, after, the, many, the, former, islands, had, been, completely, submerged, and, buried, by, flat, topped, reefs, during, the, neogene, atolls, are, the, product, of, the, growth, of, tropical, marine, organisms, and, so, these, islands, are, found, only, in, warm, tropical, waters, volcanic, islands, located, beyond, the, warm, water, temperature, requirements, of, hermatypic, reef, building, organisms, become, seamounts, as, they, subside, and, are, eroded, away, at, the, surface, an, island, that, is, located, where, the, ocean, water, temperatures, are, just, sufficiently, warm, for, upward, reef, growth, to, keep, pace, with, the, rate, of, subsidence, is, said, to, be, at, the, darwin, point, islands, in, colder, more, polar, regions, evolve, toward, seamounts, or, guyots, warmer, more, equatorial, islands, evolve, toward, atolls, for, example, kure, atoll, however, ancient, atolls, during, the, mesozoic, appear, to, exhibit, different, growth, and, evolution, patterns, coral, atolls, are, important, as, sites, where, dolomitization, of, calcite, occurs, several, models, have, been, proposed, for, the, dolomitization, of, calcite, and, aragonite, within, them, they, are, the, evaporative, seepage, reflux, mixing, zone, burial, and, seawater, models, although, the, origin, of, replacement, dolomites, remains, problematic, and, controversial, it, is, generally, accepted, that, seawater, was, the, source, of, magnesium, for, dolomitization, and, the, fluid, in, which, calcite, was, dolomitized, to, form, the, dolomites, found, within, atolls, various, processes, have, been, invoked, to, drive, large, amounts, of, seawater, through, an, atoll, in, order, for, dolomitization, to, occur, in, 1896, 1897, and, 1898, the, royal, society, of, london, carried, out, drilling, on, funafuti, atoll, in, tuvalu, for, the, purpose, of, investigating, the, formation, of, coral, reefs, they, wanted, to, determine, whether, traces, of, shallow, water, organisms, could, be, found, at, depth, in, the, coral, of, pacific, atolls, this, investigation, followed, the, work, on, the, structure, and, distribution, of, coral, reefs, conducted, by, charles, darwin, in, the, pacific, the, first, expedition, in, 1896, was, led, by, professor, william, johnson, sollas, of, the, university, of, oxford, geologists, included, walter, george, woolnough, and, edgeworth, david, of, the, university, of, sydney, professor, edgeworth, david, led, the, expedition, in, 1897, the, third, expedition, in, 1898, was, led, by, alfred, edmund, finckh
