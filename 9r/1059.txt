onia, in, modern, physics, antimatter, is, defined, as, matter, composed, of, the, antiparticles, or, partners, of, the, corresponding, particles, in, ordinary, matter, and, can, be, thought, of, as, matter, with, reversed, charge, parity, and, time, known, as, cpt, reversal, antimatter, occurs, in, natural, processes, like, cosmic, ray, collisions, and, some, types, of, radioactive, decay, but, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, these, have, successfully, been, bound, together, in, experiments, to, form, antiatoms, minuscule, numbers, of, antiparticles, can, be, generated, at, particle, accelerators, however, total, artificial, production, has, been, only, a, few, nanograms, no, macroscopic, amount, of, antimatter, has, ever, been, assembled, due, to, the, extreme, cost, and, difficulty, of, production, and, handling, nonetheless, antimatter, is, an, essential, component, of, widely, available, applications, related, to, beta, decay, such, as, positron, emission, tomography, radiation, therapy, and, industrial, imaging, in, theory, a, particle, and, its, antiparticle, for, example, a, proton, and, an, antiproton, have, the, same, mass, but, opposite, electric, charge, and, other, differences, in, quantum, numbers, a, collision, between, any, particle, and, its, anti, particle, partner, leads, to, their, mutual, annihilation, giving, rise, to, various, proportions, of, intense, photons, gamma, rays, neutrinos, and, sometimes, less, massive, particle, antiparticle, pairs, the, majority, of, the, total, energy, of, annihilation, emerges, in, the, form, of, ionizing, radiation, if, surrounding, matter, is, present, the, energy, content, of, this, radiation, will, be, absorbed, and, converted, into, other, forms, of, energy, such, as, heat, or, light, the, amount, of, energy, released, is, usually, proportional, to, the, total, mass, of, the, collided, matter, and, antimatter, in, accordance, with, the, notable, mass, energy, equivalence, equation, e, mc, 2, antiparticles, bind, with, each, other, to, form, antimatter, just, as, ordinary, particles, bind, to, form, normal, matter, for, example, a, positron, the, antiparticle, of, the, electron, and, an, antiproton, the, antiparticle, of, the, proton, can, form, an, antihydrogen, atom, the, nuclei, of, antihelium, have, been, artificially, produced, albeit, with, difficulty, and, are, the, most, complex, anti, nuclei, so, far, observed, physical, principles, indicate, that, complex, antimatter, atomic, nuclei, are, possible, as, well, as, anti, atoms, corresponding, to, the, known, chemical, elements, there, is, strong, evidence, that, the, observable, universe, is, composed, almost, entirely, of, ordinary, matter, as, opposed, to, an, equal, mixture, of, matter, and, antimatter, this, asymmetry, of, matter, and, antimatter, in, the, visible, universe, is, one, of, the, great, unsolved, problems, in, physics, the, process, by, which, this, inequality, between, matter, and, antimatter, particles, developed, is, called, baryogenesis, antimatter, particles, carry, the, same, charge, as, matter, particles, but, of, opposite, sign, that, is, an, antiproton, is, negatively, charged, and, an, antielectron, positron, is, positively, charged, neutrons, do, not, carry, a, net, charge, but, their, constituent, quarks, do, protons, and, neutrons, have, a, baryon, number, of, 1, while, antiprotons, and, antineutrons, have, a, baryon, number, of, 1, similarly, electrons, have, a, lepton, number, of, 1, while, that, of, positrons, is, 1, when, a, particle, and, its, corresponding, antiparticle, collide, they, are, both, converted, into, energy, the, french, term, for, made, of, or, pertaining, to, antimatter, contraterrene, led, to, the, initialism, c, t, and, the, science, fiction, term, seetee, as, used, in, such, novels, as, seetee, ship, the, idea, of, negative, matter, appears, in, past, theories, of, matter, that, have, now, been, abandoned, using, the, once, popular, vortex, theory, of, gravity, the, possibility, of, matter, with, negative, gravity, was, discussed, by, william, hicks, in, the, 1880s, between, the, 1880s, and, the, 1890s, karl, pearson, proposed, the, existence, of, squirts, and, sinks, of, the, flow, of, aether, the, squirts, represented, normal, matter, and, the, sinks, represented, negative, matter, pearson, s, theory, required, a, fourth, dimension, for, the, aether, to, flow, from, and, into, the, term, antimatter, was, first, used, by, arthur, schuster, in, two, rather, whimsical, letters, to, nature, in, 1898, in, which, he, coined, the, term, he, hypothesized, antiatoms, as, well, as, whole, antimatter, solar, systems, and, discussed, the, possibility, of, matter, and, antimatter, annihilating, each, other, schuster, s, ideas, were, not, a, serious, theoretical, proposal, merely, speculation, and, like, the, previous, ideas, differed, from, the, modern, concept, of, antimatter, in, that, it, possessed, negative, gravity, the, modern, theory, of, antimatter, began, in, 1928, with, a, paper, by, paul, dirac, dirac, realised, that, his, relativistic, version, of, the, schr, dinger, wave, equation, for, electrons, predicted, the, possibility, of, antielectrons, although, dirac, had, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, existence, of, these, antielectrons, he, initially, failed, to, pick, up, on, the, implications, contained, within, his, own, equation, he, freely, gave, the, credit, for, that, insight, to, j, robert, oppenheimer, whose, seminal, paper, on, the, theory, of, electrons, and, protons, feb, 14th, 1930, drew, on, dirac, s, equation, and, argued, for, the, existence, of, a, positively, charged, electron, a, positron, which, as, a, counterpart, to, the, electron, should, have, the, same, mass, as, the, electron, itself, this, meant, that, it, could, not, be, as, dirac, had, in, fact, suggested, a, proton, dirac, further, postulated, the, existence, of, antimatter, in, a, 1931, paper, which, referred, to, the, positron, as, an, anti, electron, these, were, discovered, by, carl, d, anderson, in, 1932, and, named, positrons, from, positive, electron, although, dirac, did, not, himself, use, the, term, antimatter, its, use, follows, on, naturally, enough, from, antielectrons, antiprotons, etc, a, complete, periodic, table, of, antimatter, was, envisaged, by, charles, janet, in, 1929, the, feynman, stueckelberg, interpretation, states, that, antimatter, and, antiparticles, behave, exactly, identical, to, regular, particles, but, traveling, backward, in, time, this, concept, is, nowadays, used, in, modern, particle, physics, in, feynman, diagrams, one, way, to, denote, an, antiparticle, is, by, adding, a, bar, over, the, particle, s, symbol, for, example, the, proton, and, antiproton, are, denoted, as, p, and, p, respectively, the, same, rule, applies, if, one, were, to, address, a, particle, by, its, constituent, components, a, proton, is, made, up, of, u, u, d, quarks, so, an, antiproton, must, therefore, be, formed, from, u, u, d, antiquarks, another, convention, is, to, distinguish, particles, by, positive, and, negative, electric, charge, thus, the, electron, and, positron, are, denoted, simply, as, e, and, e, respectively, to, prevent, confusion, however, the, two, conventions, are, never, mixed, there, is, no, difference, in, the, gravitational, behavior, of, matter, and, antimatter, in, other, words, antimatter, falls, down, when, dropped, not, up, this, was, confirmed, with, the, thin, very, cold, gas, of, thousands, of, antihydrogen, atoms, that, were, confined, in, a, vertical, shaft, surrounded, by, superconducting, electromagnetic, coils, these, can, create, a, magnetic, bottle, to, keep, the, antimatter, from, coming, into, contact, with, matter, and, annihilating, the, researchers, then, gradually, weakened, the, magnetic, fields, and, detected, the, antiatoms, using, two, sensors, as, they, escaped, and, annihilated, most, of, the, anti, atoms, came, out, of, the, bottom, opening, and, only, one, quarter, out, of, the, top, there, are, compelling, theoretical, reasons, to, believe, that, aside, from, the, fact, that, antiparticles, have, different, signs, on, all, charges, such, as, electric, and, baryon, charges, matter, and, antimatter, have, exactly, the, same, properties, this, means, a, particle, and, its, corresponding, antiparticle, must, have, identical, masses, and, decay, lifetimes, if, unstable, it, also, implies, that, for, example, a, star, made, up, of, antimatter, an, antistar, will, shine, just, like, an, ordinary, star, this, idea, was, tested, experimentally, in, 2016, by, the, alpha, experiment, which, measured, the, transition, between, the, two, lowest, energy, states, of, antihydrogen, the, results, which, are, identical, to, that, of, hydrogen, confirmed, the, validity, of, quantum, mechanics, for, antimatter, most, matter, observable, from, the, earth, seems, to, be, made, of, matter, rather, than, antimatter, if, antimatter, dominated, regions, of, space, existed, the, gamma, rays, produced, in, annihilation, reactions, along, the, boundary, between, matter, and, antimatter, regions, would, be, detectable, antiparticles, are, created, everywhere, in, the, universe, where, high, energy, particle, collisions, take, place, high, energy, cosmic, rays, striking, earth, s, atmosphere, or, any, other, matter, in, the, solar, system, produce, minute, quantities, of, antiparticles, in, the, resulting, particle, jets, which, are, immediately, annihilated, by, contact, with, nearby, matter, they, may, similarly, be, produced, in, regions, like, the, center, of, the, milky, way, and, other, galaxies, where, very, energetic, celestial, events, occur, principally, the, interaction, of, relativistic, jets, with, the, interstellar, medium, the, presence, of, the, resulting, antimatter, is, detectable, by, the, two, gamma, rays, produced, every, time, positrons, annihilate, with, nearby, matter, the, frequency, and, wavelength, of, the, gamma, rays, indicate, that, each, carries, 511, kev, of, energy, that, is, the, rest, mass, of, an, electron, multiplied, by, c, 2, observations, by, the, european, space, agency, s, integral, satellite, may, explain, the, origin, of, a, giant, antimatter, cloud, surrounding, the, galactic, center, the, observations, show, that, the, cloud, is, asymmetrical, and, matches, the, pattern, of, x, ray, binaries, binary, star, systems, containing, black, holes, or, neutron, stars, mostly, on, one, side, of, the, galactic, center, while, the, mechanism, is, not, fully, understood, it, is, likely, to, involve, the, production, of, electron, positron, pairs, as, ordinary, matter, gains, kinetic, energy, while, falling, into, a, stellar, remnant, antimatter, may, exist, in, relatively, large, amounts, in, far, away, galaxies, due, to, cosmic, inflation, in, the, primordial, time, of, the, universe, antimatter, galaxies, if, they, exist, are, expected, to, have, the, same, chemistry, and, absorption, and, emission, spectra, as, normal, matter, galaxies, and, their, astronomical, objects, would, be, observationally, identical, making, them, difficult, to, distinguish, nasa, is, trying, to, determine, if, such, galaxies, exist, by, looking, for, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, signatures, of, annihilation, events, in, colliding, superclusters, in, october, 2017, scientists, working, on, the, base, experiment, at, cern, reported, a, measurement, of, the, antiproton, magnetic, moment, to, a, precision, of, 1, 5, parts, per, billion, it, is, consistent, with, the, most, precise, measurement, of, the, proton, magnetic, moment, also, made, by, base, in, 2014, which, supports, the, hypothesis, of, cpt, symmetry, this, measurement, represents, the, first, time, that, a, property, of, antimatter, is, known, more, precisely, than, the, equivalent, property, in, matter, antimatter, quantum, interferometry, has, been, first, demonstrated, in, 2018, in, the, positron, laboratory, l, ness, of, rafael, ferragut, in, como, italy, by, a, group, led, by, marco, giammarchi, positrons, are, produced, naturally, in, decays, of, naturally, occurring, radioactive, isotopes, for, example, potassium, 40, and, in, interactions, of, gamma, quanta, emitted, by, radioactive, nuclei, with, matter, antineutrinos, are, another, kind, of, antiparticle, created, by, natural, radioactivity, decay, many, different, kinds, of, antiparticles, are, also, produced, by, and, contained, in, cosmic, rays, in, january, 2011, research, by, the, american, astronomical, society, discovered, antimatter, positrons, originating, above, thunderstorm, clouds, positrons, are, produced, in, terrestrial, gamma, ray, flashes, created, by, electrons, accelerated, by, strong, electric, fields, in, the, clouds, antiprotons, have, also, been, found, to, exist, in, the, van, allen, belts, around, the, earth, by, the, pamela, module, antiparticles, are, also, produced, in, any, environment, with, a, sufficiently, high, temperature, mean, particle, energy, greater, than, the, pair, production, threshold, it, is, hypothesized, that, during, the, period, of, baryogenesis, when, the, universe, was, extremely, hot, and, dense, matter, and, antimatter, were, continually, produced, and, annihilated, the, presence, of, remaining, matter, and, absence, of, detectable, remaining, antimatter, is, called, baryon, asymmetry, the, exact, mechanism, that, produced, this, asymmetry, during, baryogenesis, remains, an, unsolved, problem, one, of, the, necessary, conditions, for, this, asymmetry, is, the, violation, of, cp, symmetry, which, has, been, experimentally, observed, in, the, weak, interaction, recent, observations, indicate, black, holes, and, neutron, stars, produce, vast, amounts, of, positron, electron, plasma, via, the, jets, satellite, experiments, have, found, evidence, of, positrons, and, a, few, antiprotons, in, primary, cosmic, rays, amounting, to, less, than, 1, of, the, particles, in, primary, cosmic, rays, this, antimatter, cannot, all, have, been, created, in, the, big, bang, but, is, instead, attributed, to, have, been, produced, by, cyclic, processes, at, high, energies, for, instance, electron, positron, pairs, may, be, formed, in, pulsars, as, a, magnetized, neutron, star, rotation, cycle, shears, electron, positron, pairs, from, the, star, surface, therein, the, antimatter, forms, a, wind, that, crashes, upon, the, ejecta, of, the, progenitor, supernovae, this, weathering, takes, place, as, the, cold, magnetized, relativistic, wind, launched, by, the, star, hits, the, non, relativistically, expanding, ejecta, a, shock, wave, system, forms, in, the, impact, the, outer, one, propagates, in, the, ejecta, while, a, reverse, shock, propagates, back, towards, the, star, the, former, ejection, of, matter, in, the, outer, shock, wave, and, the, latter, production, of, antimatter, in, the, reverse, shock, wave, are, steps, in, a, space, weather, cycle, preliminary, results, from, the, presently, operating, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, ams, 02, on, board, the, international, space, station, show, that, positrons, in, the, cosmic, rays, arrive, with, no, directionality, and, with, energies, that, range, from, 10, gev, to, 250, gev, in, september, 2014, new, results, with, almost, twice, as, much, data, were, presented, in, a, talk, at, cern, and, published, in, physical, review, letters, a, new, measurement, of, positron, fraction, up, to, 500, gev, was, reported, showing, that, positron, fraction, peaks, at, a, maximum, of, about, 16, of, total, electron, positron, events, around, an, energy, of, 275, 32, gev, at, higher, energies, up, to, 500, gev, the, ratio, of, positrons, to, electrons, begins, to, fall, again, the, absolute, flux, of, positrons, also, begins, to, fall, before, 500, gev, but, peaks, at, energies, far, higher, than, electron, energies, which, peak, about, 10, gev, these, results, on, interpretation, have, been, suggested, to, be, due, to, positron, production, in, annihilation, events, of, massive, dark, matter, particles, cosmic, ray, antiprotons, also, have, a, much, higher, energy, than, their, normal, matter, counterparts, protons, they, arrive, at, earth, with, a, characteristic, energy, maximum, of, 2, gev, indicating, their, production, in, a, fundamentally, different, process, from, cosmic, ray, protons, which, on, average, have, only, one, sixth, of, the, energy, there, is, an, ongoing, search, for, larger, antimatter, nuclei, such, as, antihelium, nuclei, that, is, anti, alpha, particles, in, cosmic, rays, the, detection, of, natural, antihelium, could, imply, the, existence, of, large, antimatter, structures, such, as, an, antistar, a, prototype, of, the, ams, 02, designated, ams, 01, was, flown, into, space, aboard, the, space, shuttle, discovery, on, sts, 91, in, june, 1998, by, not, detecting, any, antihelium, at, all, the, ams, 01, established, an, upper, limit, of, 1, 1, 10, 6, for, the, antihelium, to, helium, flux, ratio, ams, 02, revealed, in, december, 2016, that, it, had, discovered, a, few, signals, consistent, with, antihelium, nuclei, amidst, several, billion, helium, nuclei, the, result, remains, to, be, verified, and, as, of, 2017, the, team, is, trying, to, rule, out, contamination, positrons, were, reported, in, november, 2008, to, have, been, generated, by, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, in, large, numbers, a, laser, drove, electrons, through, a, gold, target, s, nuclei, which, caused, the, incoming, electrons, to, emit, energy, quanta, that, decayed, into, both, matter, and, antimatter, positrons, were, detected, at, a, higher, rate, and, in, greater, density, than, ever, previously, detected, in, a, laboratory, previous, experiments, made, smaller, quantities, of, positrons, using, lasers, and, paper, thin, targets, newer, simulations, showed, that, short, bursts, of, ultra, intense, lasers, and, millimeter, thick, gold, are, a, far, more, effective, source, in, 2023, the, production, of, the, first, electron, positron, beam, plasma, was, reported, by, a, collaboration, led, by, researchers, at, university, of, oxford, working, with, the, high, radiation, to, materials, hrmt, facility, at, cern, the, beam, demonstrated, the, highest, positron, yield, achieved, so, far, in, a, laboratory, setting, the, experiment, employed, the, 440, gev, proton, beam, with, 3, 10, 11, displaystyle, 3, times, 10, 11, protons, from, the, super, proton, synchrotron, and, irradiated, a, particle, converter, composed, of, carbon, and, tantalum, this, yielded, a, total, 1, 5, 10, 13, displaystyle, 1, 5, times, 10, 13, electron, positron, pairs, via, a, particle, shower, process, the, produced, pair, beams, have, a, volume, that, fills, multiple, debye, spheres, and, are, thus, able, to, sustain, collective, plasma, oscillations, the, existence, of, the, antiproton, was, experimentally, confirmed, in, 1955, by, university, of, california, berkeley, physicists, emilio, segr, and, owen, chamberlain, for, which, they, were, awarded, the, 1959, nobel, prize, in, physics, an, antiproton, consists, of, two, up, antiquarks, and, one, down, antiquark, u, u, d, the, properties, of, the, antiproton, that, have, been, measured, all, match, the, corresponding, properties, of, the, proton, with, the, exception, of, the, antiproton, having, opposite, electric, charge, and, magnetic, moment, from, the, proton, shortly, afterwards, in, 1956, the, antineutron, was, discovered, in, proton, proton, collisions, at, the, bevatron, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, by, bruce, cork, and, colleagues, in, addition, to, anti, baryons, anti, nuclei, consisting, of, multiple, bound, antiprotons, and, antineutrons, have, been, created, these, are, typically, produced, at, energies, far, too, high, to, form, antimatter, atoms, with, bound, positrons, in, place, of, electrons, in, 1965, a, group, of, researchers, led, by, antonino, zichichi, reported, production, of, nuclei, of, antideuterium, at, the, proton, synchrotron, at, cern, at, roughly, the, same, time, observations, of, antideuterium, nuclei, were, reported, by, a, group, of, american, physicists, at, the, alternating, gradient, synchrotron, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, in, 1995, cern, announced, that, it, had, successfully, brought, into, existence, nine, hot, antihydrogen, atoms, by, implementing, the, slac, fermilab, concept, during, the, ps210, experiment, the, experiment, was, performed, using, the, low, energy, antiproton, ring, lear, and, was, led, by, walter, oelert, and, mario, macri, fermilab, soon, confirmed, the, cern, findings, by, producing, approximately, 100, antihydrogen, atoms, at, their, facilities, the, antihydrogen, atoms, created, during, ps210, and, subsequent, experiments, at, both, cern, and, fermilab, were, extremely, energetic, and, were, not, well, suited, to, study, to, resolve, this, hurdle, and, to, gain, a, better, understanding, of, antihydrogen, two, collaborations, were, formed, in, the, late, 1990s, namely, athena, and, atrap, in, 1999, cern, activated, the, antiproton, decelerator, a, device, capable, of, decelerating, antiprotons, from, 3, 5, gev, to, 5, 3, mev, still, too, hot, to, produce, study, effective, antihydrogen, but, a, huge, leap, forward, in, late, 2002, the, athena, project, announced, that, they, had, created, the, world, s, first, cold, antihydrogen, the, atrap, project, released, similar, results, very, shortly, thereafter, the, antiprotons, used, in, these, experiments, were, cooled, by, decelerating, them, with, the, antiproton, decelerator, passing, them, through, a, thin, sheet, of, foil, and, finally, capturing, them, in, a, penning, malmberg, trap, the, overall, cooling, process, is, workable, but, highly, inefficient, approximately, 25, million, antiprotons, leave, the, antiproton, decelerator, and, roughly, 25, 000, make, it, to, the, penning, malmberg, trap, which, is, about, 1, 1000, or, 0, 1, of, the, original, amount, the, antiprotons, are, still, hot, when, initially, trapped, to, cool, them, further, they, are, mixed, into, an, electron, plasma, the, electrons, in, this, plasma, cool, via, cyclotron, radiation, and, then, sympathetically, cool, the, antiprotons, via, coulomb, collisions, eventually, the, electrons, are, removed, by, the, application, of, short, duration, electric, fields, leaving, the, antiprotons, with, energies, less, than, 100, mev, while, the, antiprotons, are, being, cooled, in, the, first, trap, a, small, cloud, of, positrons, is, captured, from, radioactive, sodium, in, a, surko, style, positron, accumulator, this, cloud, is, then, recaptured, in, a, second, trap, near, the, antiprotons, manipulations, of, the, trap, electrodes, then, tip, the, antiprotons, into, the, positron, plasma, where, some, combine, with, antiprotons, to, form, antihydrogen, this, neutral, antihydrogen, is, unaffected, by, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, used, to, trap, the, charged, positrons, and, antiprotons, and, within, a, few, microseconds, the, antihydrogen, hits, the, trap, walls, where, it, annihilates, some, hundreds, of, millions, of, antihydrogen, atoms, have, been, made, in, this, fashion, in, 2005, athena, disbanded, and, some, of, the, former, members, along, with, others, formed, the, alpha, collaboration, which, is, also, based, at, cern, the, ultimate, goal, of, this, endeavour, is, to, test, cpt, symmetry, through, comparison, of, the, atomic, spectra, of, hydrogen, and, antihydrogen, see, hydrogen, spectral, series, most, of, the, sought, after, high, precision, tests, of, the, properties, of, antihydrogen, could, only, be, performed, if, the, antihydrogen, were, trapped, that, is, held, in, place, for, a, relatively, long, time, while, antihydrogen, atoms, are, electrically, neutral, the, spins, of, their, component, particles, produce, a, magnetic, moment, these, magnetic, moments, can, interact, with, an, inhomogeneous, magnetic, field, some, of, the, antihydrogen, atoms, can, be, attracted, to, a, magnetic, minimum, such, a, minimum, can, be, created, by, a, combination, of, mirror, and, multipole, fields, antihydrogen, can, be, trapped, in, such, a, magnetic, minimum, minimum, b, trap, in, november, 2010, the, alpha, collaboration, announced, that, they, had, so, trapped, 38, antihydrogen, atoms, for, about, a, sixth, of, a, second, this, was, the, first, time, that, neutral, antimatter, had, been, trapped, on, 26, april, 2011, alpha, announced, that, they, had, trapped, 309, antihydrogen, atoms, some, for, as, long, as, 1, 000, seconds, about, 17, minutes, this, was, longer, than, neutral, antimatter, had, ever, been, trapped, before, alpha, has, used, these, trapped, atoms, to, initiate, research, into, the, spectral, properties, of, antihydrogen, in, 2016, a, new, antiproton, decelerator, and, cooler, called, elena, extra, low, energy, antiproton, decelerator, was, built, it, takes, the, antiprotons, from, the, antiproton, decelerator, and, cools, them, to, 90, kev, which, is, cold, enough, to, study, this, machine, works, by, using, high, energy, and, accelerating, the, particles, within, the, chamber, more, than, one, hundred, antiprotons, can, be, captured, per, second, a, huge, improvement, but, it, would, still, take, several, thousand, years, to, make, a, nanogram, of, antimatter, the, biggest, limiting, factor, in, the, large, scale, production, of, antimatter, is, the, availability, of, antiprotons, recent, data, released, by, cern, states, that, when, fully, operational, their, facilities, are, capable, of, producing, ten, million, antiprotons, per, minute, assuming, a, 100, conversion, of, antiprotons, to, antihydrogen, it, would, take, 100, billion, years, to, produce, 1, gram, or, 1, mole, of, antihydrogen, approximately, 6, 02, 10, 23, atoms, of, anti, hydrogen, however, cern, only, produces, 1, of, the, anti, matter, fermilab, does, and, neither, are, designed, to, produce, anti, matter, according, to, gerald, jackson, using, technology, already, in, use, today, we, are, capable, of, producing, and, capturing, 20, grams, of, anti, matter, particles, per, year, at, a, yearly, cost, of, 670, million, dollars, per, facility, antihelium, 3, nuclei, 3, he, were, first, observed, in, the, 1970s, in, proton, nucleus, collision, experiments, at, the, institute, for, high, energy, physics, by, y, prockoshkin, s, group, protvino, near, moscow, ussr, and, later, created, in, nucleus, nucleus, collision, experiments, nucleus, nucleus, collisions, produce, antinuclei, through, the, coalescence, of, antiprotons, and, antineutrons, created, in, these, reactions, in, 2011, the, star, detector, reported, the, observation, of, artificially, created, antihelium, 4, nuclei, anti, alpha, particles, 4, he, from, such, collisions, the, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, on, the, international, space, station, has, as, of, 2021, recorded, eight, events, that, seem, to, indicate, the, detection, of, antihelium, 3, antimatter, cannot, be, stored, in, a, container, made, of, ordinary, matter, because, antimatter, reacts, with, any, matter, it, touches, annihilating, itself, and, an, equal, amount, of, the, container, antimatter, in, the, form, of, charged, particles, can, be, contained, by, a, combination, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, a, device, called, a, penning, trap, this, device, cannot, however, contain, antimatter, that, consists, of, uncharged, particles, for, which, atomic, traps, are, used, in, particular, such, a, trap, may, use, the, dipole, moment, electric, or, magnetic, of, the, trapped, particles, at, high, vacuum, the, matter, or, antimatter, particles, can, be, trapped, and, cooled, with, slightly, off, resonant, laser, radiation, using, a, magneto, optical, trap, or, magnetic, trap, small, particles, can, also, be, suspended, with, optical, tweezers, using, a, highly, focused, laser, beam, in, 2011, cern, scientists, were, able, to, preserve, antihydrogen, for, approximately, 17, minutes, the, record, for, storing, antiparticles, is, currently, held, by, the, trap, experiment, at, cern, antiprotons, were, kept, in, a, penning, trap, for, 405, days, a, proposal, was, made, in, 2018, to, develop, containment, technology, advanced, enough, to, contain, a, billion, anti, protons, in, a, portable, device, to, be, driven, to, another, lab, for, further, experimentation, scientists, claim, that, antimatter, is, the, costliest, material, to, make, in, 2006, gerald, smith, estimated, 250, million, could, produce, 10, milligrams, of, positrons, equivalent, to, 25, billion, per, gram, in, 1999, nasa, gave, a, figure, of, 62, 5, trillion, per, gram, of, antihydrogen, this, is, because, production, is, difficult, only, very, few, antiprotons, are, produced, in, reactions, in, particle, accelerators, and, because, there, is, higher, demand, for, other, uses, of, particle, accelerators, according, to, cern, it, has, cost, a, few, hundred, million, swiss, francs, to, produce, about, 1, billionth, of, a, gram, the, amount, used, so, far, for, particle, antiparticle, collisions, in, comparison, to, produce, the, first, atomic, weapon, the, cost, of, the, manhattan, project, was, estimated, at, 23, billion, with, inflation, during, 2007, several, studies, funded, by, nasa, innovative, advanced, concepts, are, exploring, whether, it, might, be, possible, to, use, magnetic, scoops, to, collect, the, antimatter, that, occurs, naturally, in, the, van, allen, belt, of, the, earth, and, ultimately, the, belts, of, gas, giants, like, jupiter, ideally, at, a, lower, cost, per, gram, matter, antimatter, reactions, have, practical, applications, in, medical, imaging, such, as, positron, emission, tomography, pet, in, positive, beta, decay, a, nuclide, loses, surplus, positive, charge, by, emitting, a, positron, in, the, same, event, a, proton, becomes, a, neutron, and, a, neutrino, is, also, emitted, nuclides, with, surplus, positive, charge, are, easily, made, in, a, cyclotron, and, are, widely, generated, for, medical, use, antiprotons, have, also, been, shown, within, laboratory, experiments, to, have, the, potential, to, treat, certain, cancers, in, a, similar, method, currently, used, for, ion, proton, therapy, isolated, and, stored, antimatter, could, be, used, as, a, fuel, for, interplanetary, or, interstellar, travel, as, part, of, an, antimatter, catalyzed, nuclear, pulse, propulsion, or, another, antimatter, rocket, since, the, energy, density, of, antimatter, is, higher, than, that, of, conventional, fuels, an, antimatter, fueled, spacecraft, would, have, a, higher, thrust, to, weight, ratio, than, a, conventional, spacecraft, if, matter, antimatter, collisions, resulted, only, in, photon, emission, the, entire, rest, mass, of, the, particles, would, be, converted, to, kinetic, energy, the, energy, per, unit, mass, 9, 10, 16, j, kg, is, about, 10, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, chemical, energies, and, about, 3, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, nuclear, potential, energy, that, can, be, liberated, today, using, nuclear, fission, about, 200, mev, per, fission, reaction, or, 8, 10, 13, j, kg, and, about, 2, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, best, possible, results, expected, from, fusion, about, 6, 3, 10, 14, j, kg, for, the, proton, proton, chain, the, reaction, of, 1, kg, of, antimatter, with, 1, kg, of, matter, would, produce, 1, 8, 10, 17, j, 180, petajoules, of, energy, by, the, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, e, mc, 2, or, the, rough, equivalent, of, 43, megatons, of, tnt, slightly, less, than, the, yield, of, the, 27, 000, kg, tsar, bomba, the, largest, thermonuclear, weapon, ever, detonated, not, all, of, that, energy, can, be, utilized, by, any, realistic, propulsion, technology, because, of, the, nature, of, the, annihilation, products, while, electron, positron, reactions, result, in, gamma, ray, photons, these, are, difficult, to, direct, and, use, for, thrust, in, reactions, between, protons, and, antiprotons, their, energy, is, converted, largely, into, relativistic, neutral, and, charged, pions, the, neutral, pions, decay, almost, immediately, with, a, lifetime, of, 85, attoseconds, into, high, energy, photons, but, the, charged, pions, decay, more, slowly, with, a, lifetime, of, 26, nanoseconds, and, can, be, deflected, magnetically, to, produce, thrust, charged, pions, ultimately, decay, into, a, combination, of, neutrinos, carrying, about, 22, of, the, energy, of, the, charged, pions, and, unstable, charged, muons, carrying, about, 78, of, the, charged, pion, energy, with, the, muons, then, decaying, into, a, combination, of, electrons, positrons, and, neutrinos, cf, muon, decay, the, neutrinos, from, this, decay, carry, about, 2, 3, of, the, energy, of, the, muons, meaning, that, from, the, original, charged, pions, the, total, fraction, of, their, energy, converted, to, neutrinos, by, one, route, or, another, would, be, about, 0, 22, 2, 3, 0, 78, 0, 74, antimatter, has, been, considered, as, a, trigger, mechanism, for, nuclear, weapons, a, major, obstacle, is, the, difficulty, of, producing, antimatter, in, large, enough, quantities, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, it, will, ever, be, feasible, nonetheless, the, u, s, air, force, funded, studies, of, the, physics, of, antimatter, in, the, cold, war, and, began, considering, its, possible, use, in, weapons, not, just, as, a, trigger, but, as, the, explosive, itself
