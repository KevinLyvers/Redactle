spectroscopy, is, the, field, of, study, that, measures, and, interprets, electromagnetic, spectra, in, narrower, contexts, spectroscopy, is, the, precise, study, of, color, as, generalized, from, visible, light, to, all, bands, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, spectroscopy, primarily, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, is, a, fundamental, exploratory, tool, in, the, fields, of, astronomy, chemistry, materials, science, and, physics, allowing, the, composition, physical, structure, and, electronic, structure, of, matter, to, be, investigated, at, the, atomic, molecular, and, macro, scale, and, over, astronomical, distances, historically, spectroscopy, originated, as, the, study, of, the, wavelength, dependence, of, the, absorption, by, gas, phase, matter, of, visible, light, dispersed, by, a, prism, current, applications, of, spectroscopy, include, biomedical, spectroscopy, in, the, areas, of, tissue, analysis, and, medical, imaging, matter, waves, and, acoustic, waves, can, also, be, considered, forms, of, radiative, energy, and, recently, gravitational, waves, have, been, associated, with, a, spectral, signature, in, the, context, of, the, laser, interferometer, gravitational, wave, observatory, ligo, spectroscopy, is, a, branch, of, science, concerned, with, the, spectra, of, electromagnetic, radiation, as, a, function, of, its, wavelength, or, frequency, measured, by, spectrographic, equipment, and, other, techniques, in, order, to, obtain, information, concerning, the, structure, and, properties, of, matter, spectral, measurement, devices, are, referred, to, as, spectrometers, spectrophotometers, spectrographs, or, spectral, analyzers, most, spectroscopic, analysis, in, the, laboratory, starts, with, a, sample, to, be, analyzed, then, a, light, source, is, chosen, from, any, desired, range, of, the, light, spectrum, then, the, light, goes, through, the, sample, to, a, dispersion, array, diffraction, grating, instrument, and, captured, by, a, photodiode, for, astronomical, purposes, the, telescope, must, be, equipped, with, the, light, dispersion, device, there, are, various, versions, of, this, basic, setup, that, may, be, employed, spectroscopy, began, with, isaac, newton, splitting, light, with, a, prism, a, key, moment, in, the, development, of, modern, optics, therefore, it, was, originally, the, study, of, visible, light, that, we, call, color, that, later, under, the, studies, of, james, clerk, maxwell, came, to, include, the, entire, electromagnetic, spectrum, although, color, is, involved, in, spectroscopy, it, is, not, equated, with, the, color, of, elements, or, objects, that, involve, the, absorption, and, reflection, of, certain, electromagnetic, waves, to, give, objects, a, sense, of, color, to, our, eyes, rather, spectroscopy, involves, the, splitting, of, light, by, a, prism, diffraction, grating, or, similar, instrument, to, give, off, a, particular, discrete, line, pattern, called, a, spectrum, unique, to, each, different, type, of, element, most, elements, are, first, put, into, a, gaseous, phase, to, allow, the, spectra, to, be, examined, although, today, other, methods, can, be, used, on, different, phases, each, element, that, is, diffracted, by, a, prism, like, instrument, displays, either, an, absorption, spectrum, or, an, emission, spectrum, depending, upon, whether, the, element, is, being, cooled, or, heated, until, recently, all, spectroscopy, involved, the, study, of, line, spectra, and, most, spectroscopy, still, does, vibrational, spectroscopy, is, the, branch, of, spectroscopy, that, studies, the, spectra, however, the, latest, developments, in, spectroscopy, can, sometimes, dispense, with, the, dispersion, technique, in, biochemical, spectroscopy, information, can, be, gathered, about, biological, tissue, by, absorption, and, light, scattering, techniques, light, scattering, spectroscopy, is, a, type, of, reflectance, spectroscopy, that, determines, tissue, structures, by, examining, elastic, scattering, in, such, a, case, it, is, the, tissue, that, acts, as, a, diffraction, or, dispersion, mechanism, spectroscopic, studies, were, central, to, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, because, the, first, useful, atomic, models, described, the, spectra, of, hydrogen, which, include, the, bohr, model, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, matrix, mechanics, all, of, which, can, produce, the, spectral, lines, of, hydrogen, therefore, providing, the, basis, for, discrete, quantum, jumps, to, match, the, discrete, hydrogen, spectrum, also, max, planck, s, explanation, of, blackbody, radiation, involved, spectroscopy, because, he, was, comparing, the, wavelength, of, light, using, a, photometer, to, the, temperature, of, a, black, body, spectroscopy, is, used, in, physical, and, analytical, chemistry, because, atoms, and, molecules, have, unique, spectra, as, a, result, these, spectra, can, be, used, to, detect, identify, and, quantify, information, about, the, atoms, and, molecules, spectroscopy, is, also, used, in, astronomy, and, remote, sensing, on, earth, most, research, telescopes, have, spectrographs, the, measured, spectra, are, used, to, determine, the, chemical, composition, and, physical, properties, of, astronomical, objects, such, as, their, temperature, density, of, elements, in, a, star, velocity, black, holes, and, more, an, important, use, for, spectroscopy, is, in, biochemistry, molecular, samples, may, be, analyzed, for, species, identification, and, energy, content, the, underlying, premise, of, spectroscopy, is, that, light, is, made, of, different, wavelengths, and, that, each, wavelength, corresponds, to, a, different, frequency, the, importance, of, spectroscopy, is, centered, around, the, fact, that, every, element, in, the, periodic, table, has, a, unique, light, spectrum, described, by, the, frequencies, of, light, it, emits, or, absorbs, consistently, appearing, in, the, same, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, when, that, light, is, diffracted, this, opened, up, an, entire, field, of, study, with, anything, that, contains, atoms, spectroscopy, is, the, key, to, understanding, the, atomic, properties, of, all, matter, as, such, spectroscopy, opened, up, many, new, sub, fields, of, science, yet, undiscovered, the, idea, that, each, atomic, element, has, its, unique, spectral, signature, enabled, spectroscopy, to, be, used, in, a, broad, number, of, fields, each, with, a, specific, goal, achieved, by, different, spectroscopic, procedures, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, maintains, a, public, atomic, spectra, database, that, is, continually, updated, with, precise, measurements, the, broadening, of, the, field, of, spectroscopy, is, due, to, the, fact, that, any, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, may, be, used, to, analyze, a, sample, from, the, infrared, to, the, ultraviolet, telling, scientists, different, properties, about, the, very, same, sample, for, instance, in, chemical, analysis, the, most, common, types, of, spectroscopy, include, atomic, spectroscopy, infrared, spectroscopy, ultraviolet, and, visible, spectroscopy, raman, spectroscopy, and, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, the, theory, behind, it, is, that, frequency, is, analogous, to, resonance, and, its, corresponding, resonant, frequency, resonances, by, the, frequency, were, first, characterized, in, mechanical, systems, such, as, pendulums, which, have, a, frequency, of, motion, noted, famously, by, galileo, spectroscopy, is, a, sufficiently, broad, field, that, many, sub, disciplines, exist, each, with, numerous, implementations, of, specific, spectroscopic, techniques, the, various, implementations, and, techniques, can, be, classified, in, several, ways, the, types, of, spectroscopy, are, distinguished, by, the, type, of, radiative, energy, involved, in, the, interaction, in, many, applications, the, spectrum, is, determined, by, measuring, changes, in, the, intensity, or, frequency, of, this, energy, the, types, of, radiative, energy, studied, include, the, types, of, spectroscopy, also, can, be, distinguished, by, the, nature, of, the, interaction, between, the, energy, and, the, material, these, interactions, include, spectroscopic, studies, are, designed, so, that, the, radiant, energy, interacts, with, specific, types, of, matter, atomic, spectroscopy, was, the, first, application, of, spectroscopy, atomic, absorption, spectroscopy, and, atomic, emission, spectroscopy, involve, visible, and, ultraviolet, light, these, absorptions, and, emissions, often, referred, to, as, atomic, spectral, lines, are, due, to, electronic, transitions, of, outer, shell, electrons, as, they, rise, and, fall, from, one, electron, orbit, to, another, atoms, also, have, distinct, x, ray, spectra, that, are, attributable, to, the, excitation, of, inner, shell, electrons, to, excited, states, atoms, of, different, elements, have, distinct, spectra, and, therefore, atomic, spectroscopy, allows, for, the, identification, and, quantitation, of, a, sample, s, elemental, composition, after, inventing, the, spectroscope, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, discovered, new, elements, by, observing, their, emission, spectra, atomic, absorption, lines, are, observed, in, the, solar, spectrum, and, referred, to, as, fraunhofer, lines, after, their, discoverer, a, comprehensive, explanation, of, the, hydrogen, spectrum, was, an, early, success, of, quantum, mechanics, and, explained, the, lamb, shift, observed, in, the, hydrogen, spectrum, which, further, led, to, the, development, of, quantum, electrodynamics, modern, implementations, of, atomic, spectroscopy, for, studying, visible, and, ultraviolet, transitions, include, flame, emission, spectroscopy, inductively, coupled, plasma, atomic, emission, spectroscopy, glow, discharge, spectroscopy, microwave, induced, plasma, spectroscopy, and, spark, or, arc, emission, spectroscopy, techniques, for, studying, x, ray, spectra, include, x, ray, spectroscopy, and, x, ray, fluorescence, the, combination, of, atoms, into, molecules, leads, to, the, creation, of, unique, types, of, energetic, states, and, therefore, unique, spectra, of, the, transitions, between, these, states, molecular, spectra, can, be, obtained, due, to, electron, spin, states, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, molecular, rotations, molecular, vibration, and, electronic, states, rotations, are, collective, motions, of, the, atomic, nuclei, and, typically, lead, to, spectra, in, the, microwave, and, millimetre, wave, spectral, regions, rotational, spectroscopy, and, microwave, spectroscopy, are, synonymous, vibrations, are, relative, motions, of, the, atomic, nuclei, and, are, studied, by, both, infrared, and, raman, spectroscopy, electronic, excitations, are, studied, using, visible, and, ultraviolet, spectroscopy, as, well, as, fluorescence, spectroscopy, studies, in, molecular, spectroscopy, led, to, the, development, of, the, first, maser, and, contributed, to, the, subsequent, development, of, the, laser, the, combination, of, atoms, or, molecules, into, crystals, or, other, extended, forms, leads, to, the, creation, of, additional, energetic, states, these, states, are, numerous, and, therefore, have, a, high, density, of, states, this, high, density, often, makes, the, spectra, weaker, and, less, distinct, i, e, broader, for, instance, blackbody, radiation, is, due, to, the, thermal, motions, of, atoms, and, molecules, within, a, material, acoustic, and, mechanical, responses, are, due, to, collective, motions, as, well, pure, crystals, though, can, have, distinct, spectral, transitions, and, the, crystal, arrangement, also, has, an, effect, on, the, observed, molecular, spectra, the, regular, lattice, structure, of, crystals, also, scatters, x, rays, electrons, or, neutrons, allowing, for, crystallographic, studies, nuclei, also, have, distinct, energy, states, that, are, widely, separated, and, lead, to, gamma, ray, spectra, distinct, nuclear, spin, states, can, have, their, energy, separated, by, a, magnetic, field, and, this, allows, for, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, other, types, of, spectroscopy, are, distinguished, by, specific, applications, or, implementations, there, are, several, applications, of, spectroscopy, in, the, fields, of, medicine, physics, chemistry, and, astronomy, taking, advantage, of, the, properties, of, absorbance, and, with, astronomy, emission, spectroscopy, can, be, used, to, identify, certain, states, of, nature, the, uses, of, spectroscopy, in, so, many, different, fields, and, for, so, many, different, applications, has, caused, specialty, scientific, subfields, such, examples, include, the, history, of, spectroscopy, began, with, isaac, newton, s, optics, experiments, 1666, 1672, according, to, andrew, fraknoi, and, david, morrison, in, 1672, in, the, first, paper, that, he, submitted, to, the, royal, society, isaac, newton, described, an, experiment, in, which, he, permitted, sunlight, to, pass, through, a, small, hole, and, then, through, a, prism, newton, found, that, sunlight, which, looks, white, to, us, is, actually, made, up, of, a, mixture, of, all, the, colors, of, the, rainbow, newton, applied, the, word, spectrum, to, describe, the, rainbow, of, colors, that, combine, to, form, white, light, and, that, are, revealed, when, the, white, light, is, passed, through, a, prism, fraknoi, and, morrison, state, that, in, 1802, william, hyde, wollaston, built, an, improved, spectrometer, that, included, a, lens, to, focus, the, sun, s, spectrum, on, a, screen, upon, use, wollaston, realized, that, the, colors, were, not, spread, uniformly, but, instead, had, missing, patches, of, colors, which, appeared, as, dark, bands, in, the, spectrum, during, the, early, 1800s, joseph, von, fraunhofer, made, experimental, advances, with, dispersive, spectrometers, that, enabled, spectroscopy, to, become, a, more, precise, and, quantitative, scientific, technique, since, then, spectroscopy, has, played, and, continues, to, play, a, significant, role, in, chemistry, physics, and, astronomy, per, fraknoi, and, morrison, later, in, 1815, german, physicist, joseph, fraunhofer, also, examined, the, solar, spectrum, and, found, about, 600, such, dark, lines, missing, colors, are, now, known, as, fraunhofer, lines, or, absorption, lines, in, quantum, mechanical, systems, the, analogous, resonance, is, a, coupling, of, two, quantum, mechanical, stationary, states, of, one, system, such, as, an, atom, via, an, oscillatory, source, of, energy, such, as, a, photon, the, coupling, of, the, two, states, is, strongest, when, the, energy, of, the, source, matches, the, energy, difference, between, the, two, states, the, energy, e, of, a, photon, is, related, to, its, frequency, by, e, h, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, so, a, spectrum, of, the, system, response, vs, photon, frequency, will, peak, at, the, resonant, frequency, or, energy, particles, such, as, electrons, and, neutrons, have, a, comparable, relationship, the, de, broglie, relations, between, their, kinetic, energy, and, their, wavelength, and, frequency, and, therefore, can, also, excite, resonant, interactions, spectra, of, atoms, and, molecules, often, consist, of, a, series, of, spectral, lines, each, one, representing, a, resonance, between, two, different, quantum, states, the, explanation, of, these, series, and, the, spectral, patterns, associated, with, them, were, one, of, the, experimental, enigmas, that, drove, the, development, and, acceptance, of, quantum, mechanics, the, hydrogen, spectral, series, in, particular, was, first, successfully, explained, by, the, rutherford, bohr, quantum, model, of, the, hydrogen, atom, in, some, cases, spectral, lines, are, well, separated, and, distinguishable, but, spectral, lines, can, also, overlap, and, appear, to, be, a, single, transition, if, the, density, of, energy, states, is, high, enough, named, series, of, lines, include, the, principal, sharp, diffuse, and, fundamental, series
