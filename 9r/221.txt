the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, cmbr, or, relic, radiation, is, microwave, radiation, that, fills, all, space, in, the, observable, universe, with, a, standard, optical, telescope, the, background, space, between, stars, and, galaxies, is, almost, completely, dark, however, a, sufficiently, sensitive, radio, telescope, detects, a, faint, background, glow, that, is, almost, uniform, and, is, not, associated, with, any, star, galaxy, or, other, object, this, glow, is, strongest, in, the, microwave, region, of, the, radio, spectrum, the, accidental, discovery, of, the, cmb, in, 1965, by, american, radio, astronomers, arno, penzias, and, robert, wilson, was, the, culmination, of, work, initiated, in, the, 1940s, the, cmb, is, landmark, evidence, of, the, big, bang, theory, for, the, origin, of, the, universe, in, the, big, bang, cosmological, models, during, the, earliest, periods, the, universe, was, filled, with, an, opaque, fog, of, dense, hot, plasma, of, sub, atomic, particles, as, the, universe, expanded, this, plasma, cooled, to, the, point, where, protons, and, electrons, combined, to, form, neutral, atoms, of, mostly, hydrogen, unlike, the, plasma, these, atoms, could, not, scatter, thermal, radiation, by, thomson, scattering, and, so, the, universe, became, transparent, known, as, the, recombination, epoch, this, decoupling, event, released, photons, to, travel, freely, through, space, however, the, photons, have, grown, less, energetic, due, to, the, cosmological, redshift, associated, with, the, expansion, of, the, universe, the, surface, of, last, scattering, refers, to, a, shell, at, the, right, distance, in, space, so, photons, are, now, received, that, were, originally, emitted, at, the, time, of, decoupling, the, cmb, is, not, completely, smooth, and, uniform, showing, a, faint, anisotropy, that, can, be, mapped, by, sensitive, detectors, ground, and, space, based, experiments, such, as, cobe, wmap, and, planck, have, been, used, to, measure, these, temperature, inhomogeneities, the, anisotropy, structure, is, determined, by, various, interactions, of, matter, and, photons, up, to, the, point, of, decoupling, which, results, in, a, characteristic, lumpy, pattern, that, varies, with, angular, scale, the, distribution, of, the, anisotropy, across, the, sky, has, frequency, components, that, can, be, represented, by, a, power, spectrum, displaying, a, sequence, of, peaks, and, valleys, the, peak, values, of, this, spectrum, hold, important, information, about, the, physical, properties, of, the, early, universe, the, first, peak, determines, the, overall, curvature, of, the, universe, while, the, second, and, third, peak, detail, the, density, of, normal, matter, and, so, called, dark, matter, respectively, extracting, fine, details, from, the, cmb, data, can, be, challenging, since, the, emission, has, undergone, modification, by, foreground, features, such, as, galaxy, clusters, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, is, an, emission, of, uniform, black, body, thermal, energy, coming, from, all, directions, intensity, of, the, cmb, is, expressed, in, kelvin, k, the, si, unit, of, temperature, the, cmb, has, a, thermal, black, body, spectrum, at, a, temperature, of, 2, 725, 48, 0, 000, 57, k, variations, in, intensity, are, expressed, as, variations, in, temperature, the, blackbody, temperature, uniquely, characterizes, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, at, all, wavelengths, a, measured, brightness, temperature, at, any, wavelength, can, be, converted, to, a, blackbody, temperature, the, radiation, is, remarkably, uniform, across, the, sky, very, unlike, the, almost, point, like, structure, of, stars, or, clumps, of, stars, in, galaxies, the, radiation, is, isotropic, to, roughly, one, part, in, 25, 000, the, root, mean, square, variations, are, just, over, 100, k, after, subtracting, a, dipole, anisotropy, from, the, doppler, shift, of, the, background, radiation, the, latter, is, caused, by, the, peculiar, velocity, of, the, sun, relative, to, the, comoving, cosmic, rest, frame, as, it, moves, at, 369, 82, 0, 11, km, s, towards, the, constellation, crater, near, its, boundary, with, the, constellation, leo, the, cmb, dipole, and, aberration, at, higher, multipoles, have, been, measured, consistent, with, galactic, motion, despite, the, very, small, degree, of, anisotropy, in, the, cmb, many, aspects, can, be, measured, with, high, precision, and, such, measurements, are, critical, for, cosmological, theories, in, addition, to, temperature, anisotropy, the, cmb, should, have, an, angular, variation, in, polarization, the, polarization, at, each, direction, in, the, sky, has, an, orientation, described, in, terms, of, e, mode, and, b, mode, polarization, the, e, mode, signal, is, a, factor, of, 10, less, strong, than, the, temperature, anisotropy, it, supplements, the, temperature, data, as, they, are, correlated, the, b, mode, signal, is, even, weaker, but, may, contain, additional, cosmological, data, the, anisotropy, is, related, to, physical, origin, of, the, polarization, excitation, of, an, electron, by, linear, polarized, light, generates, polarized, light, at, 90, degrees, to, the, incident, direction, if, the, incoming, radiation, is, isotropic, different, incoming, directions, create, polarizations, that, cancel, out, if, the, incoming, radiation, has, quadrupole, anisotropy, residual, polarization, will, be, seen, other, than, the, temperature, and, polarization, anisotropy, the, cmb, frequency, spectrum, is, expected, to, feature, tiny, departures, from, the, black, body, law, known, as, spectral, distortions, these, are, also, at, the, focus, of, an, active, research, effort, with, the, hope, of, a, first, measurement, within, the, forthcoming, decades, as, they, contain, a, wealth, of, information, about, the, primordial, universe, and, the, formation, of, structures, at, late, time, the, cmb, contains, the, vast, majority, of, photons, in, the, universe, by, a, factor, of, 400, to, 1, 5, the, number, density, of, photons, in, the, cmb, is, one, billion, times, 10, 9, the, number, density, of, matter, in, the, universe, without, the, expansion, of, the, universe, to, cause, the, cooling, of, the, cmb, the, night, sky, would, shine, as, brightly, as, the, sun, the, energy, density, of, the, cmb, is, 0, 260, ev, cm, 3, 4, 17, 10, 14, j, m, 3, about, 411, photons, cm, 3, in, 1931, georges, lema, tre, speculated, that, remnants, of, the, early, universe, may, be, observable, as, radiation, but, his, candidate, was, cosmic, rays, 140, richard, c, tolman, showed, in, 1934, that, expansion, of, the, universe, would, cool, blackbody, radiation, while, maintaining, a, thermal, spectrum, the, cosmic, microwave, background, was, first, predicted, in, 1948, by, ralph, alpher, and, robert, herman, in, a, correction, they, prepared, for, a, paper, by, alpher, s, phd, advisor, george, gamow, alpher, and, herman, were, able, to, estimate, the, temperature, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, to, be, 5, k, the, first, published, recognition, of, the, cmb, radiation, as, a, detectable, phenomenon, appeared, in, a, brief, paper, by, soviet, astrophysicists, a, g, doroshkevich, and, igor, novikov, in, the, spring, of, 1964, in, 1964, david, todd, wilkinson, and, peter, roll, dicke, s, colleagues, at, princeton, university, began, constructing, a, dicke, radiometer, to, measure, the, cosmic, microwave, background, in, 1964, arno, penzias, and, robert, woodrow, wilson, at, the, crawford, hill, location, of, bell, telephone, laboratories, in, nearby, holmdel, township, new, jersey, had, built, a, dicke, radiometer, that, they, intended, to, use, for, radio, astronomy, and, satellite, communication, experiments, the, antenna, was, constructed, in, 1959, to, support, project, echo, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, s, passive, communications, satellites, which, used, large, earth, orbiting, aluminized, plastic, balloons, as, reflectors, to, bounce, radio, signals, from, one, point, on, the, earth, to, another, on, 20, may, 1964, they, made, their, first, measurement, clearly, showing, the, presence, of, the, microwave, background, with, their, instrument, having, an, excess, 4, 2k, antenna, temperature, which, they, could, not, account, for, after, receiving, a, telephone, call, from, crawford, hill, dicke, said, boys, we, ve, been, scooped, 140, a, meeting, between, the, princeton, and, crawford, hill, groups, determined, that, the, antenna, temperature, was, indeed, due, to, the, microwave, background, penzias, and, wilson, received, the, 1978, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, discovery, the, interpretation, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, was, a, controversial, issue, in, the, late, 1960s, alternative, explanations, included, energy, from, within, the, solar, system, from, galaxies, from, intergalactic, plasma, from, multiple, extragalactic, radio, sources, two, requirements, would, show, that, the, microwave, radiation, was, truly, cosmic, first, the, intensity, vs, frequency, or, spectrum, needed, to, be, shown, to, match, a, thermal, or, blackbody, source, this, was, accomplished, by, 1968, in, a, series, of, measurements, of, the, radiation, temperature, at, higher, and, lower, wavelengths, second, the, radiation, needed, be, shown, to, be, isotropic, the, same, from, all, directions, this, was, also, accomplished, by, 1970, demonstrating, that, this, radiation, was, truly, cosmic, in, origin, in, the, 1970s, numerous, studies, showed, that, tiny, deviations, from, isotropy, in, the, cmb, could, result, from, events, in, the, early, universe, 8, 5, 1, harrison, peebles, and, yu, and, zel, dovich, realized, that, the, early, universe, would, require, quantum, inhomogeneities, that, would, result, in, temperature, anisotropy, at, the, level, of, 10, 4, or, 10, 5, 8, 5, 3, 2, rashid, sunyaev, using, the, alternative, name, relic, radiation, calculated, the, observable, imprint, that, these, inhomogeneities, would, have, on, the, cosmic, microwave, background, after, a, lull, in, the, 1970s, caused, in, part, by, the, many, experimental, difficulties, in, measuring, cmb, at, high, precision, 8, 5, 1, increasingly, stringent, limits, on, the, anisotropy, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, were, set, by, ground, based, experiments, during, the, 1980s, relikt, 1, a, soviet, cosmic, microwave, background, anisotropy, experiment, on, board, the, prognoz, 9, satellite, launched, 1, july, 1983, gave, the, first, upper, limits, on, the, large, scale, anisotropy, 8, 5, 3, 2, the, other, key, event, in, the, 1980s, was, the, proposal, by, alan, guth, for, cosmic, inflation, this, theory, of, rapid, spatial, expansion, gave, an, explanation, for, large, scale, isotropy, by, allowing, causal, connection, just, before, the, epoch, of, last, scattering, 8, 5, 4, with, this, and, similar, theories, detailed, prediction, encouraged, larger, and, more, ambitious, experiments, the, nasa, cosmic, background, explorer, cobe, satellite, orbited, earth, in, 1989, 1996, detected, and, quantified, the, large, scale, anisotropies, at, the, limit, of, its, detection, capabilities, the, nasa, cobe, mission, clearly, confirmed, the, primary, anisotropy, with, the, differential, microwave, radiometer, instrument, publishing, their, findings, in, 1992, the, team, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, 2006, for, this, discovery, inspired, by, the, cobe, results, a, series, of, ground, and, balloon, based, experiments, measured, cosmic, microwave, background, anisotropies, on, smaller, angular, scales, over, the, two, decades, the, sensitivity, of, the, new, experiments, improved, dramatically, with, a, reduction, in, internal, noise, by, three, orders, of, magnitude, the, primary, goal, of, these, experiments, was, to, measure, the, scale, of, the, first, acoustic, peak, which, cobe, did, not, have, sufficient, resolution, to, resolve, this, peak, corresponds, to, large, scale, density, variations, in, the, early, universe, that, are, created, by, gravitational, instabilities, resulting, in, acoustical, oscillations, in, the, plasma, the, first, peak, in, the, anisotropy, was, tentatively, detected, by, the, mat, toco, experiment, and, the, result, was, confirmed, by, the, boomerang, and, maxima, experiments, these, measurements, demonstrated, that, the, geometry, of, the, universe, is, approximately, flat, rather, than, curved, they, ruled, out, cosmic, strings, as, a, major, component, of, cosmic, structure, formation, and, suggested, cosmic, inflation, was, the, right, theory, of, structure, formation, inspired, by, the, initial, cobe, results, of, an, extremely, isotropic, and, homogeneous, background, a, series, of, ground, and, balloon, based, experiments, quantified, cmb, anisotropies, on, smaller, angular, scales, over, the, next, decade, the, primary, goal, of, these, experiments, was, to, measure, the, angular, scale, of, the, first, acoustic, peak, for, which, cobe, did, not, have, sufficient, resolution, these, measurements, were, able, to, rule, out, cosmic, strings, as, the, leading, theory, of, cosmic, structure, formation, and, suggested, cosmic, inflation, was, the, right, theory, during, the, 1990s, the, first, peak, was, measured, with, increasing, sensitivity, and, by, 2000, the, boomerang, experiment, reported, that, the, highest, power, fluctuations, occur, at, scales, of, approximately, one, degree, together, with, other, cosmological, data, these, results, implied, that, the, geometry, of, the, universe, is, flat, a, number, of, ground, based, interferometers, provided, measurements, of, the, fluctuations, with, higher, accuracy, over, the, next, three, years, including, the, very, small, array, degree, angular, scale, interferometer, dasi, and, the, cosmic, background, imager, cbi, dasi, made, the, first, detection, of, the, polarization, of, the, cmb, and, the, cbi, provided, the, first, e, mode, polarization, spectrum, with, compelling, evidence, that, it, is, out, of, phase, with, the, t, mode, spectrum, in, june, 2001, nasa, launched, a, second, cmb, space, mission, wmap, to, make, much, more, precise, measurements, of, the, large, scale, anisotropies, over, the, full, sky, wmap, used, symmetric, rapid, multi, modulated, scanning, rapid, switching, radiometers, at, five, frequencies, to, minimize, non, sky, signal, noise, the, data, from, the, mission, was, released, in, five, installments, the, last, being, the, nine, year, summary, the, results, are, broadly, consistent, lambda, cdm, models, based, on, 6, free, parameters, and, fitting, in, to, big, bang, cosmology, with, cosmic, inflation, the, degree, angular, scale, interferometer, dasi, was, a, telescope, installed, at, the, u, s, national, science, foundation, s, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, in, antarctica, it, was, a, 13, element, interferometer, operating, between, 26, and, 36, ghz, ka, band, in, ten, bands, the, instrument, is, similar, in, design, to, the, cosmic, background, imager, cbi, and, the, very, small, array, vsa, a, third, space, mission, the, esa, european, space, agency, planck, surveyor, was, launched, in, may, 2009, and, performed, an, even, more, detailed, investigation, until, it, was, shut, down, in, october, 2013, planck, employed, both, hemt, radiometers, and, bolometer, technology, and, measured, the, cmb, at, a, smaller, scale, than, wmap, its, detectors, were, trialled, in, the, antarctic, viper, telescope, as, acbar, arcminute, cosmology, bolometer, array, receiver, experiment, which, has, produced, the, most, precise, measurements, at, small, angular, scales, to, date, and, in, the, archeops, balloon, telescope, on, 21, march, 2013, the, european, led, research, team, behind, the, planck, cosmology, probe, released, the, mission, s, all, sky, map, 565x318, jpeg, 3600x1800, jpeg, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, map, suggests, the, universe, is, slightly, older, than, researchers, expected, according, to, the, map, subtle, fluctuations, in, temperature, were, imprinted, on, the, deep, sky, when, the, cosmos, was, about, 370, 000, years, old, the, imprint, reflects, ripples, that, arose, as, early, in, the, existence, of, the, universe, as, the, first, nonillionth, 10, 30, of, a, second, apparently, these, ripples, gave, rise, to, the, present, vast, cosmic, web, of, galaxy, clusters, and, dark, matter, based, on, the, 2013, data, the, universe, contains, 4, 9, ordinary, matter, 26, 8, dark, matter, and, 68, 3, dark, energy, on, 5, february, 2015, new, data, was, released, by, the, planck, mission, according, to, which, the, age, of, the, universe, is, 13, 799, 0, 021, billion, years, old, and, the, hubble, constant, was, measured, to, be, 67, 74, 0, 46, km, s, mpc, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, and, the, cosmological, redshift, distance, relation, are, together, regarded, as, the, best, available, evidence, for, the, big, bang, event, measurements, of, the, cmb, have, made, the, inflationary, big, bang, model, the, standard, cosmological, model, the, discovery, of, the, cmb, in, the, mid, 1960s, curtailed, interest, in, alternatives, such, as, the, steady, state, theory, in, the, big, bang, model, for, the, formation, of, the, universe, inflationary, cosmology, predicts, that, after, about, 10, 37, seconds, the, nascent, universe, underwent, exponential, growth, that, smoothed, out, nearly, all, irregularities, the, remaining, irregularities, were, caused, by, quantum, fluctuations, in, the, inflaton, field, that, caused, the, inflation, event, long, before, the, formation, of, stars, and, planets, the, early, universe, was, more, compact, much, hotter, and, starting, 10, 6, seconds, after, the, big, bang, filled, with, a, uniform, glow, from, its, white, hot, fog, of, interacting, plasma, of, photons, electrons, and, baryons, as, the, universe, expanded, adiabatic, cooling, caused, the, energy, density, of, the, plasma, to, decrease, until, it, became, favorable, for, electrons, to, combine, with, protons, forming, hydrogen, atoms, this, recombination, event, happened, when, the, temperature, was, around, 3000, k, or, when, the, universe, was, approximately, 379, 000, years, old, as, photons, did, not, interact, with, these, electrically, neutral, atoms, the, former, began, to, travel, freely, through, space, resulting, in, the, decoupling, of, matter, and, radiation, the, color, temperature, of, the, ensemble, of, decoupled, photons, has, continued, to, diminish, ever, since, now, down, to, 2, 7260, 0, 0013, k, it, will, continue, to, drop, as, the, universe, expands, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, corresponds, to, black, body, radiation, at, 2, 726, k, because, red, shifted, black, body, radiation, is, just, like, black, body, radiation, at, a, lower, temperature, according, to, the, big, bang, model, the, radiation, from, the, sky, we, measure, today, comes, from, a, spherical, surface, called, the, surface, of, last, scattering, this, represents, the, set, of, locations, in, space, at, which, the, decoupling, event, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, and, at, a, point, in, time, such, that, the, photons, from, that, distance, have, just, reached, observers, most, of, the, radiation, energy, in, the, universe, is, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, making, up, a, fraction, of, roughly, 6, 10, 5, of, the, total, density, of, the, universe, two, of, the, greatest, successes, of, the, big, bang, theory, are, its, prediction, of, the, almost, perfect, black, body, spectrum, and, its, detailed, prediction, of, the, anisotropies, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, cmb, spectrum, has, become, the, most, precisely, measured, black, body, spectrum, in, nature, in, the, late, 1940s, alpher, and, herman, reasoned, that, if, there, was, a, big, bang, the, expansion, of, the, universe, would, have, stretched, the, high, energy, radiation, of, the, very, early, universe, into, the, microwave, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, down, to, a, temperature, of, about, 5, k, they, were, slightly, off, with, their, estimate, but, they, had, the, right, idea, they, predicted, the, cmb, it, took, another, 15, years, for, penzias, and, wilson, to, discover, that, the, microwave, background, was, actually, there, according, to, standard, cosmology, the, cmb, gives, a, snapshot, of, the, hot, early, universe, at, the, point, in, time, when, the, temperature, dropped, enough, to, allow, electrons, and, protons, to, form, hydrogen, atoms, this, event, made, the, universe, nearly, transparent, to, radiation, because, light, was, no, longer, being, scattered, off, free, electrons, when, this, occurred, some, 380, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, the, temperature, of, the, universe, was, about, 3, 000, k, this, corresponds, to, an, ambient, energy, of, about, 0, 26, ev, which, is, much, less, than, the, 13, 6, ev, ionization, energy, of, hydrogen, this, epoch, is, generally, known, as, the, time, of, last, scattering, or, the, period, of, recombination, or, decoupling, since, decoupling, the, color, temperature, of, the, background, radiation, has, dropped, by, an, average, factor, of, 1, 089, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, as, the, universe, expands, the, cmb, photons, are, redshifted, causing, them, to, decrease, in, energy, the, color, temperature, of, this, radiation, stays, inversely, proportional, to, a, parameter, that, describes, the, relative, expansion, of, the, universe, over, time, known, as, the, scale, length, the, color, temperature, t, r, of, the, cmb, as, a, function, of, redshift, z, can, be, shown, to, be, proportional, to, the, color, temperature, of, the, cmb, as, observed, in, the, present, day, 2, 725, k, or, 0, 2348, mev, the, high, degree, of, uniformity, throughout, the, observable, universe, and, its, faint, but, measured, anisotropy, lend, strong, support, for, the, big, bang, model, in, general, and, the, cdm, lambda, cold, dark, matter, model, in, particular, moreover, the, fluctuations, are, coherent, on, angular, scales, that, are, larger, than, the, apparent, cosmological, horizon, at, recombination, either, such, coherence, is, acausally, fine, tuned, or, cosmic, inflation, occurred, the, anisotropy, or, directional, dependency, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, is, divided, into, two, types, primary, anisotropy, due, to, effects, that, occur, at, the, surface, of, last, scattering, and, before, and, secondary, anisotropy, due, to, effects, such, as, interactions, of, the, background, radiation, with, intervening, hot, gas, or, gravitational, potentials, which, occur, between, the, last, scattering, surface, and, the, observer, the, structure, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, anisotropies, is, principally, determined, by, two, effects, acoustic, oscillations, and, diffusion, damping, also, called, collisionless, damping, or, silk, damping, the, acoustic, oscillations, arise, because, of, a, conflict, in, the, photon, baryon, plasma, in, the, early, universe, the, pressure, of, the, photons, tends, to, erase, anisotropies, whereas, the, gravitational, attraction, of, the, baryons, moving, at, speeds, much, slower, than, light, makes, them, tend, to, collapse, to, form, overdensities, these, two, effects, compete, to, create, acoustic, oscillations, which, give, the, microwave, background, its, characteristic, peak, structure, the, peaks, correspond, roughly, to, resonances, in, which, the, photons, decouple, when, a, particular, mode, is, at, its, peak, amplitude, the, peaks, contain, interesting, physical, signatures, the, angular, scale, of, the, first, peak, determines, the, curvature, of, the, universe, but, not, the, topology, of, the, universe, the, next, peak, ratio, of, the, odd, peaks, to, the, even, peaks, determines, the, reduced, baryon, density, the, third, peak, can, be, used, to, get, information, about, the, dark, matter, density, the, locations, of, the, peaks, give, important, information, about, the, nature, of, the, primordial, density, perturbations, there, are, two, fundamental, types, of, density, perturbations, called, adiabatic, and, isocurvature, a, general, density, perturbation, is, a, mixture, of, both, and, different, theories, that, purport, to, explain, the, primordial, density, perturbation, spectrum, predict, different, mixtures, the, cmb, spectrum, can, distinguish, between, these, two, because, these, two, types, of, perturbations, produce, different, peak, locations, isocurvature, density, perturbations, produce, a, series, of, peaks, whose, angular, scales, values, of, the, peaks, are, roughly, in, the, ratio, 1, 3, 5, while, adiabatic, density, perturbations, produce, peaks, whose, locations, are, in, the, ratio, 1, 2, 3, observations, are, consistent, with, the, primordial, density, perturbations, being, entirely, adiabatic, providing, key, support, for, inflation, and, ruling, out, many, models, of, structure, formation, involving, for, example, cosmic, strings, collisionless, damping, is, caused, by, two, effects, when, the, treatment, of, the, primordial, plasma, as, fluid, begins, to, break, down, these, effects, contribute, about, equally, to, the, suppression, of, anisotropies, at, small, scales, and, give, rise, to, the, characteristic, exponential, damping, tail, seen, in, the, very, small, angular, scale, anisotropies, the, depth, of, the, lss, refers, to, the, fact, that, the, decoupling, of, the, photons, and, baryons, does, not, happen, instantaneously, but, instead, requires, an, appreciable, fraction, of, the, age, of, the, universe, up, to, that, era, one, method, of, quantifying, how, long, this, process, took, uses, the, photon, visibility, function, pvf, this, function, is, defined, so, that, denoting, the, pvf, by, p, t, the, probability, that, a, cmb, photon, last, scattered, between, time, t, and, t, dt, is, given, by, p, t, dt, the, maximum, of, the, pvf, the, time, when, it, is, most, likely, that, a, given, cmb, photon, last, scattered, is, known, quite, precisely, the, first, year, wmap, results, put, the, time, at, which, p, t, has, a, maximum, as, 372, 000, years, this, is, often, taken, as, the, time, at, which, the, cmb, formed, however, to, figure, out, how, long, it, took, the, photons, and, baryons, to, decouple, we, need, a, measure, of, the, width, of, the, pvf, the, wmap, team, finds, that, the, pvf, is, greater, than, half, of, its, maximal, value, the, full, width, at, half, maximum, or, fwhm, over, an, interval, of, 115, 000, years, 179, by, this, measure, decoupling, took, place, over, roughly, 115, 000, years, and, thus, when, it, was, complete, the, universe, was, roughly, 487, 000, years, old, since, the, cmb, came, into, existence, it, has, apparently, been, modified, by, several, subsequent, physical, processes, which, are, collectively, referred, to, as, late, time, anisotropy, or, secondary, anisotropy, when, the, cmb, photons, became, free, to, travel, unimpeded, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, was, mostly, in, the, form, of, neutral, hydrogen, and, helium, atoms, however, observations, of, galaxies, today, seem, to, indicate, that, most, of, the, volume, of, the, intergalactic, medium, igm, consists, of, ionized, material, since, there, are, few, absorption, lines, due, to, hydrogen, atoms, this, implies, a, period, of, reionization, during, which, some, of, the, material, of, the, universe, was, broken, into, hydrogen, ions, the, cmb, photons, are, scattered, by, free, charges, such, as, electrons, that, are, not, bound, in, atoms, in, an, ionized, universe, such, charged, particles, have, been, liberated, from, neutral, atoms, by, ionizing, ultraviolet, radiation, today, these, free, charges, are, at, sufficiently, low, density, in, most, of, the, volume, of, the, universe, that, they, do, not, measurably, affect, the, cmb, however, if, the, igm, was, ionized, at, very, early, times, when, the, universe, was, still, denser, then, there, are, two, main, effects, on, the, cmb, both, of, these, effects, have, been, observed, by, the, wmap, spacecraft, providing, evidence, that, the, universe, was, ionized, at, very, early, times, at, a, redshift, around, 10, the, detailed, provenance, of, this, early, ionizing, radiation, is, still, a, matter, of, scientific, debate, it, may, have, included, starlight, from, the, very, first, population, of, stars, population, iii, stars, supernovae, when, these, first, stars, reached, the, end, of, their, lives, or, the, ionizing, radiation, produced, by, the, accretion, disks, of, massive, black, holes, the, time, following, the, emission, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, and, before, the, observation, of, the, first, stars, is, semi, humorously, referred, to, by, cosmologists, as, the, dark, age, and, is, a, period, which, is, under, intense, study, by, astronomers, see, 21, centimeter, radiation, two, other, effects, which, occurred, between, reionization, and, our, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, and, which, appear, to, cause, anisotropies, are, the, sunyaev, zeldovich, effect, where, a, cloud, of, high, energy, electrons, scatters, the, radiation, transferring, some, of, its, energy, to, the, cmb, photons, and, the, sachs, wolfe, effect, which, causes, photons, from, the, cosmic, microwave, background, to, be, gravitationally, redshifted, or, blueshifted, due, to, changing, gravitational, fields, the, standard, cosmology, that, includes, the, big, bang, enjoys, considerable, popularity, among, the, practicing, cosmologists, 211, however, there, are, challenges, to, the, standard, big, bang, framework, for, explaining, cmb, data, in, particular, standard, cosmology, requires, fine, tuning, of, some, free, parameters, with, different, values, supported, by, different, experimental, data, 245, as, an, example, of, the, fine, tuning, issue, standard, cosmology, cannot, predict, the, present, temperature, of, the, relic, radiation, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, 229, this, value, of, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, is, one, of, the, best, results, of, experimental, cosmology, and, the, steady, state, model, can, predict, it, however, alternative, models, have, their, own, set, of, problems, and, they, have, only, made, post, facto, explanations, of, existing, observations, 239, nevertheless, these, alternatives, have, played, an, important, historic, role, in, providing, ideas, for, and, challenges, to, the, standard, explanation, the, cosmic, microwave, background, is, polarized, at, the, level, of, a, few, microkelvin, there, are, two, types, of, polarization, called, e, mode, or, gradient, mode, and, b, mode, or, curl, mode, this, is, in, analogy, to, electrostatics, in, which, the, electric, field, e, field, has, a, vanishing, curl, and, the, magnetic, field, b, field, has, a, vanishing, divergence, the, e, modes, arise, from, thomson, scattering, in, a, heterogeneous, plasma, e, modes, were, first, seen, in, 2002, by, the, degree, angular, scale, interferometer, dasi, b, modes, are, expected, to, be, an, order, of, magnitude, weaker, than, the, e, modes, the, former, are, not, produced, by, standard, scalar, type, perturbations, but, are, generated, by, gravitational, waves, during, cosmic, inflation, shortly, after, the, big, bang, however, gravitational, lensing, of, the, stronger, e, modes, can, also, produce, b, mode, polarization, detecting, the, original, b, modes, signal, requires, analysis, of, the, contamination, caused, by, lensing, of, the, relatively, strong, e, mode, signal, models, of, slow, roll, cosmic, inflation, in, the, early, universe, predicts, primordial, gravitational, waves, that, would, impact, the, polarisation, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, creating, a, specific, pattern, of, b, mode, polarization, detection, of, this, pattern, would, support, the, theory, of, inflation, and, their, strength, can, confirm, and, exclude, different, models, of, inflation, claims, that, this, characteristic, pattern, of, b, mode, polarization, had, been, measured, by, bicep2, instrument, were, later, attributed, to, cosmic, dust, due, to, new, results, of, the, planck, experiment, 253, the, second, type, of, b, modes, was, discovered, in, 2013, using, the, south, pole, telescope, with, help, from, the, herschel, space, observatory, in, october, 2014, a, measurement, of, the, b, mode, polarization, at, 150, ghz, was, published, by, the, polarbear, experiment, compared, to, bicep2, polarbear, focuses, on, a, smaller, patch, of, the, sky, and, is, less, susceptible, to, dust, effects, the, team, reported, that, polarbear, s, measured, b, mode, polarization, was, of, cosmological, origin, and, not, just, due, to, dust, at, a, 97, 2, confidence, level, the, cmb, angular, anisotropies, are, usually, presented, in, terms, of, power, per, multipole, the, angular, the, map, of, temperature, across, the, sky, t, displaystyle, t, theta, varphi, is, written, as, coefficients, of, spherical, harmonics, t, m, a, m, y, m, displaystyle, t, theta, varphi, sum, ell, m, a, ell, m, y, ell, m, theta, varphi, where, the, a, m, displaystyle, a, ell, m, term, measures, the, strength, of, the, angular, oscillation, in, y, m, displaystyle, y, ell, m, theta, varphi, and, is, the, multipole, number, while, m, is, the, azimuthal, number, the, azimuthal, variation, is, not, significant, and, is, removed, by, applying, the, angular, correlation, function, giving, power, spectrum, term, c, a, m, 2, displaystyle, c, ell, equiv, langle, a, ell, m, 2, rangle, increasing, values, of, correspond, to, higher, multipole, moments, of, cmb, meaning, more, rapid, variation, with, angle, the, monopole, term, 0, is, the, constant, isotropic, mean, temperature, of, the, cmb, t, 2, 7255, 0, 0006, k, with, one, standard, deviation, confidence, this, term, must, be, measured, with, absolute, temperature, devices, such, as, the, firas, instrument, on, the, cobe, satellite, 499, cmb, dipole, represents, the, largest, anisotropy, which, is, in, the, first, spherical, harmonic, 1, a, cosine, function, the, amplitude, of, cmb, dipole, is, around, 3, 3621, 0, 0010, mk, the, cmb, dipole, moment, is, interpreted, as, the, peculiar, motion, of, the, earth, relative, to, the, cmb, its, amplitude, depends, on, the, time, due, to, the, earth, s, orbit, about, the, barycenter, of, the, solar, system, this, enables, us, to, add, a, time, dependent, term, to, the, dipole, expression, the, modulation, of, this, term, is, 1, year, which, fits, the, observation, done, by, cobe, firas, the, dipole, moment, does, not, encode, any, primordial, information, from, the, cmb, data, it, is, seen, that, the, sun, appears, to, be, moving, at, 369, 82, 0, 11, km, s, relative, to, the, reference, frame, of, the, cmb, also, called, the, cmb, rest, frame, or, the, frame, of, reference, in, which, there, is, no, motion, through, the, cmb, the, local, group, the, galaxy, group, that, includes, our, own, milky, way, galaxy, appears, to, be, moving, at, 620, 15, km, s, in, the, direction, of, galactic, longitude, 271, 9, 2, b, 30, 3, the, dipole, is, now, used, to, calibrate, mapping, studies, the, temperature, variation, in, the, cmb, temperature, maps, at, higher, multipoles, or, 2, is, considered, to, be, the, result, of, perturbations, of, the, density, in, the, early, universe, before, the, recombination, epoch, at, a, redshift, of, around, z, 1100, before, recombination, the, universe, consisted, of, a, hot, dense, plasma, of, electrons, and, baryons, in, such, a, hot, dense, environment, electrons, and, protons, could, not, form, any, neutral, atoms, the, baryons, in, such, early, universe, remained, highly, ionized, and, so, were, tightly, coupled, with, photons, through, the, effect, of, thompson, scattering, these, phenomena, caused, the, pressure, and, gravitational, effects, to, act, against, each, other, and, triggered, fluctuations, in, the, photon, baryon, plasma, quickly, after, the, recombination, epoch, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, universe, caused, the, plasma, to, cool, down, and, these, fluctuations, are, frozen, into, the, cmb, maps, we, observe, today, raw, cmbr, data, even, from, space, vehicles, such, as, wmap, or, planck, contain, foreground, effects, that, completely, obscure, the, fine, scale, structure, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, fine, scale, structure, is, superimposed, on, the, raw, cmbr, data, but, is, too, small, to, be, seen, at, the, scale, of, the, raw, data, the, most, prominent, of, the, foreground, effects, is, the, dipole, anisotropy, caused, by, the, sun, s, motion, relative, to, the, cmbr, background, the, dipole, anisotropy, and, others, due, to, earth, s, annual, motion, relative, to, the, sun, and, numerous, microwave, sources, in, the, galactic, plane, and, elsewhere, must, be, subtracted, out, to, reveal, the, extremely, tiny, variations, characterizing, the, fine, scale, structure, of, the, cmbr, background, the, detailed, analysis, of, cmbr, data, to, produce, maps, an, angular, power, spectrum, and, ultimately, cosmological, parameters, is, a, complicated, computationally, difficult, problem, in, practice, it, is, hard, to, take, the, effects, of, noise, and, foreground, sources, into, account, in, particular, these, foregrounds, are, dominated, by, galactic, emissions, such, as, bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and, dust, that, emit, in, the, microwave, band, in, practice, the, galaxy, has, to, be, removed, resulting, in, a, cmb, map, that, is, not, a, full, sky, map, in, addition, point, sources, like, galaxies, and, clusters, represent, another, source, of, foreground, which, must, be, removed, so, as, not, to, distort, the, short, scale, structure, of, the, cmb, power, spectrum, constraints, on, many, cosmological, parameters, can, be, obtained, from, their, effects, on, the, power, spectrum, and, results, are, often, calculated, using, markov, chain, monte, carlo, sampling, techniques, with, the, increasingly, precise, data, provided, by, wmap, there, have, been, a, number, of, claims, that, the, cmb, exhibits, anomalies, such, as, very, large, scale, anisotropies, anomalous, alignments, and, non, gaussian, distributions, the, most, longstanding, of, these, is, the, low, multipole, controversy, even, in, the, cobe, map, it, was, observed, that, the, quadrupole, 2, spherical, harmonic, has, a, low, amplitude, compared, to, the, predictions, of, the, big, bang, in, particular, the, quadrupole, and, octupole, 3, modes, appear, to, have, an, unexplained, alignment, with, each, other, and, with, both, the, ecliptic, plane, and, equinoxes, a, number, of, groups, have, suggested, that, this, could, be, the, signature, of, new, physics, at, the, greatest, observable, scales, other, groups, suspect, systematic, errors, in, the, data, ultimately, due, to, the, foregrounds, and, the, cosmic, variance, problem, the, greatest, modes, will, never, be, as, well, measured, as, the, small, angular, scale, modes, the, analyses, were, performed, on, two, maps, that, have, had, the, foregrounds, removed, as, far, as, possible, the, internal, linear, combination, map, of, the, wmap, collaboration, and, a, similar, map, prepared, by, max, tegmark, and, others, later, analyses, have, pointed, out, that, these, are, the, modes, most, susceptible, to, foreground, contamination, from, synchrotron, dust, and, bremsstrahlung, emission, and, from, experimental, uncertainty, in, the, monopole, and, dipole, a, full, bayesian, analysis, of, the, wmap, power, spectrum, demonstrates, that, the, quadrupole, prediction, of, lambda, cdm, cosmology, is, consistent, with, the, data, at, the, 10, level, and, that, the, observed, octupole, is, not, remarkable, carefully, accounting, for, the, procedure, used, to, remove, the, foregrounds, from, the, full, sky, map, further, reduces, the, significance, of, the, alignment, by, 5, recent, observations, with, the, planck, telescope, which, is, very, much, more, sensitive, than, wmap, and, has, a, larger, angular, resolution, record, the, same, anomaly, and, so, instrumental, error, but, not, foreground, contamination, appears, to, be, ruled, out, coincidence, is, a, possible, explanation, chief, scientist, from, wmap, charles, l, bennett, suggested, coincidence, and, human, psychology, were, involved, i, do, think, there, is, a, bit, of, a, psychological, effect, people, want, to, find, unusual, things, measurements, of, the, density, of, quasars, based, on, wide, field, infrared, survey, explorer, data, finds, a, dipole, significantly, different, from, the, one, extracted, from, the, cmb, anisotropy, this, difference, is, conflict, with, the, cosmological, principle, assuming, the, universe, keeps, expanding, and, it, does, not, suffer, a, big, crunch, a, big, rip, or, another, similar, fate, the, cosmic, microwave, background, will, continue, redshifting, until, it, will, no, longer, be, detectable, and, will, be, superseded, first, by, the, one, produced, by, starlight, and, perhaps, later, by, the, background, radiation, fields, of, processes, that, may, take, place, in, the, far, future, of, the, universe, such, as, proton, decay, evaporation, of, black, holes, and, positronium, decay
