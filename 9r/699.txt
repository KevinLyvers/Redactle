a, jungle, is, land, covered, with, dense, forest, and, tangled, vegetation, usually, in, tropical, climates, application, of, the, term, has, varied, greatly, during, the, past, century, the, word, jungle, originates, from, the, sanskrit, word, ja, gala, meaning, rough, and, arid, it, came, into, the, english, language, in, the, 18th, century, via, the, hindustani, word, for, forest, hindi, urdu, jangal, j, gala, has, also, been, variously, transcribed, in, english, as, jangal, jangla, jungal, and, ju, gala, it, has, been, suggested, that, an, anglo, indian, interpretation, led, to, its, connotation, as, a, dense, tangled, thicket, the, term, is, prevalent, in, many, languages, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, iranian, plateau, where, it, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, plant, growth, replacing, primeval, forest, or, to, the, unkempt, tropical, vegetation, that, takes, over, abandoned, areas, because, jungles, occur, on, all, inhabited, landmasses, and, may, incorporate, numerous, vegetation, and, land, types, in, different, climatic, zones, the, wildlife, of, jungles, cannot, be, straightforwardly, defined, one, of, the, most, common, meanings, of, jungle, is, land, overgrown, with, tangled, vegetation, at, ground, level, especially, in, the, tropics, typically, such, vegetation, is, sufficiently, dense, to, hinder, movement, by, humans, requiring, that, travellers, cut, their, way, through, this, definition, draws, a, distinction, between, rainforest, and, jungle, since, the, understorey, of, rainforests, is, typically, open, of, vegetation, due, to, a, lack, of, sunlight, and, hence, relatively, easy, to, traverse, jungles, may, exist, within, or, at, the, borders, of, tropical, forests, in, areas, where, the, woodland, has, been, opened, through, natural, disturbance, such, as, hurricanes, or, through, human, activity, such, as, logging, the, successional, vegetation, that, springs, up, following, such, disturbance, is, dense, and, tangled, and, is, a, typical, jungle, jungle, also, typically, forms, along, rainforest, margins, such, as, stream, banks, once, again, due, to, the, greater, available, light, at, ground, level, monsoon, forests, and, mangroves, are, commonly, referred, to, as, jungles, of, this, type, having, a, more, open, canopy, than, rainforests, monsoon, forests, typically, have, dense, understoreys, with, numerous, lianas, and, shrubs, making, movement, difficult, while, the, prop, roots, and, low, canopies, of, mangroves, produce, similar, difficulties, because, european, explorers, initially, travelled, through, tropical, forests, largely, by, river, the, dense, tangled, vegetation, lining, the, stream, banks, gave, a, misleading, impression, that, such, jungle, conditions, existed, throughout, the, entire, forest, as, a, result, it, was, wrongly, assumed, that, the, entire, forest, was, impenetrable, jungle, this, in, turn, appears, to, have, given, rise, to, the, second, popular, usage, of, jungle, as, virtually, any, humid, tropical, forest, jungle, in, this, context, is, particularly, associated, with, tropical, rain, forest, but, may, extend, to, cloud, forest, temperate, rainforest, and, mangroves, with, no, reference, to, the, vegetation, structure, or, the, ease, of, travel, the, terms, tropical, forest, and, rainforest, have, largely, replaced, jungle, as, the, descriptor, of, humid, tropical, forests, a, linguistic, transition, that, has, occurred, since, the, 1970s, rainforest, itself, did, not, appear, in, english, dictionaries, prior, to, the, 1970s, the, word, jungle, accounted, for, over, 80, of, the, terms, used, to, refer, to, tropical, forests, in, print, media, prior, to, the, 1970s, since, then, it, has, been, steadily, replaced, by, rainforest, although, jungle, still, remains, in, common, use, when, referring, to, tropical, rainforests, as, a, metaphor, jungle, often, refers, to, situations, that, are, unruly, or, lawless, or, where, the, only, law, is, perceived, to, be, survival, of, the, fittest, this, reflects, the, view, of, city, people, that, forests, are, such, places, upton, sinclair, gave, the, title, the, jungle, 1906, to, his, famous, book, about, the, life, of, workers, at, the, chicago, stockyards, portraying, the, workers, as, being, mercilessly, exploited, with, no, legal, or, other, lawful, recourse, the, term, the, law, of, the, jungle, is, also, used, in, a, similar, context, drawn, from, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, 1894, though, in, the, society, of, jungle, animals, portrayed, in, that, book, and, obviously, meant, as, a, metaphor, for, human, society, that, phrase, referred, to, an, intricate, code, of, laws, which, kipling, describes, in, detail, and, not, at, all, to, a, lawless, chaos, the, word, jungle, carries, connotations, of, untamed, and, uncontrollable, nature, and, isolation, from, civilisation, along, with, the, emotions, that, evokes, threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation, and, immobilisation, the, change, from, jungle, to, rainforest, as, the, preferred, term, for, describing, tropical, forests, has, been, a, response, to, an, increasing, perception, of, these, forests, as, fragile, and, spiritual, places, a, viewpoint, not, in, keeping, with, the, darker, connotations, of, jungle, cultural, scholars, especially, post, colonial, critics, often, analyse, the, jungle, within, the, concept, of, hierarchical, domination, and, the, demand, western, cultures, often, places, on, other, cultures, to, conform, to, their, standards, of, civilisation, for, example, edward, said, notes, that, the, tarzan, depicted, by, johnny, weissmuller, was, a, resident, of, the, jungle, representing, the, savage, untamed, and, wild, yet, still, a, white, master, of, it, and, in, his, essay, an, image, of, africa, about, heart, of, darkness, nigerian, novelist, and, theorist, chinua, achebe, notes, how, the, jungle, and, africa, become, the, source, of, temptation, for, white, european, characters, like, marlowe, and, kurtz, former, israeli, prime, minister, ehud, barak, compared, israel, to, a, villa, in, the, jungle, a, comparison, which, had, been, often, quoted, in, israeli, political, debates, barak, s, critics, on, the, left, side, of, israeli, politics, strongly, criticised, the, comparison
