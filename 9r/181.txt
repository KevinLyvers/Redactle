ursa, minor, latin, for, lesser, bear, contrasting, with, ursa, major, also, known, as, the, little, bear, is, a, constellation, located, in, the, far, northern, sky, as, with, the, great, bear, the, tail, of, the, little, bear, may, also, be, seen, as, the, handle, of, a, ladle, hence, the, north, american, name, little, dipper, seven, stars, with, four, in, its, bowl, like, its, partner, the, big, dipper, ursa, minor, was, one, of, the, 48, constellations, listed, by, the, 2nd, century, astronomer, ptolemy, and, remains, one, of, the, 88, modern, constellations, ursa, minor, has, traditionally, been, important, for, navigation, particularly, by, mariners, because, of, polaris, being, the, north, pole, star, polaris, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, is, a, yellow, white, supergiant, and, the, brightest, cepheid, variable, star, in, the, night, sky, ranging, in, apparent, magnitude, from, 1, 97, to, 2, 00, beta, ursae, minoris, also, known, as, kochab, is, an, aging, star, that, has, swollen, and, cooled, to, become, an, orange, giant, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 2, 08, only, slightly, fainter, than, polaris, kochab, and, 3rd, magnitude, gamma, ursae, minoris, have, been, called, the, guardians, of, the, pole, star, or, guardians, of, the, pole, planets, have, been, detected, orbiting, four, of, the, stars, including, kochab, the, constellation, also, contains, an, isolated, neutron, star, calvera, and, h1504, 65, the, hottest, white, dwarf, yet, discovered, with, a, surface, temperature, of, 200, 000, k, in, the, babylonian, star, catalogues, ursa, minor, was, known, as, the, wagon, of, heaven, mul, mar, g, d, da, an, na, also, associated, with, the, goddess, damkina, it, is, listed, in, the, mul, apin, catalogue, compiled, around, 1000, bc, among, the, stars, of, enlil, that, is, the, northern, sky, according, to, diogenes, la, rtius, citing, callimachus, thales, of, miletus, measured, the, stars, of, the, wagon, by, which, the, phoenicians, sail, diogenes, identifies, these, as, the, constellation, of, ursa, minor, which, for, its, reported, use, by, the, phoenicians, for, navigation, at, sea, were, also, named, phoinik, the, tradition, of, naming, the, northern, constellations, bears, appears, to, be, genuinely, greek, although, homer, refers, to, just, a, single, bear, the, original, bear, is, thus, ursa, major, and, ursa, minor, was, admitted, as, the, second, or, phoenician, bear, ursa, phoenicia, hence, phoenice, only, later, according, to, strabo, i, 1, 6, c3, due, to, a, suggestion, by, thales, who, suggested, it, as, a, navigation, aid, to, the, greeks, who, had, been, navigating, by, ursa, major, in, classical, antiquity, the, celestial, pole, was, somewhat, closer, to, beta, ursae, minoris, than, to, alpha, ursae, minoris, and, the, entire, constellation, was, taken, to, indicate, the, northern, direction, since, the, medieval, period, it, has, become, convenient, to, use, alpha, ursae, minoris, or, polaris, as, the, north, star, even, though, in, the, medieval, period, polaris, was, still, several, degrees, away, from, the, celestial, pole, now, polaris, is, within, 1, of, the, north, celestial, pole, and, remains, the, current, pole, star, its, neo, latin, name, of, stella, polaris, was, coined, only, in, the, early, modern, period, the, ancient, name, of, the, constellation, is, cynosura, greek, dog, s, tail, the, origin, of, this, name, is, unclear, ursa, minor, being, a, dog, s, tail, would, imply, that, another, constellation, nearby, is, the, dog, but, no, such, constellation, is, known, instead, the, mythographic, tradition, of, catasterismi, makes, cynosura, the, name, of, an, oread, nymph, described, as, a, nurse, of, zeus, honoured, by, the, god, with, a, place, in, the, sky, there, are, various, proposed, explanations, for, the, name, cynosura, one, suggestion, connects, it, to, the, myth, of, callisto, with, her, son, arcas, replaced, by, her, dog, being, placed, in, the, sky, by, zeus, others, have, suggested, that, an, archaic, interpretation, of, ursa, major, was, that, of, a, cow, forming, a, group, with, bo, tes, as, herdsman, and, ursa, minor, as, a, dog, george, william, cox, explained, it, as, a, variant, of, understood, as, wolf, s, tail, but, by, him, etymologized, as, trail, or, train, of, light, i, e, wolf, vs, light, allen, points, to, the, old, irish, name, of, the, constellation, drag, blod, fire, trail, for, comparison, brown, 1899, suggested, a, non, greek, origin, of, the, name, a, loan, from, an, assyrian, an, nas, sur, ra, high, rising, an, alternative, myth, tells, of, two, bears, that, saved, zeus, from, his, murderous, father, cronus, by, hiding, him, on, mount, ida, later, zeus, set, them, in, the, sky, but, their, tails, grew, long, from, their, being, swung, up, into, the, sky, by, the, god, because, ursa, minor, consists, of, seven, stars, the, latin, word, for, north, i, e, where, polaris, points, is, septentrio, from, septem, seven, and, triones, oxen, from, seven, oxen, driving, a, plough, which, the, seven, stars, also, resemble, this, name, has, also, been, attached, to, the, main, stars, of, ursa, major, in, inuit, astronomy, the, three, brightest, stars, polaris, kochab, and, pherkad, were, known, as, nuutuittut, never, moving, though, the, term, is, more, frequently, used, in, the, singular, to, refer, to, polaris, alone, the, pole, star, is, too, high, in, the, sky, at, far, northern, latitudes, to, be, of, use, in, navigation, in, chinese, astronomy, the, main, stars, of, ursa, minor, are, divided, between, two, asterisms, g, uch, n, curved, array, including, umi, umi, umi, umi, umi, umi, umi, and, b, ij, northern, pole, including, umi, and, umi, ursa, minor, is, bordered, by, camelopardalis, to, the, west, draco, to, the, west, and, cepheus, to, the, east, covering, 256, square, degrees, it, ranks, 56th, of, the, 88, constellations, in, size, ursa, minor, is, colloquially, known, in, the, us, as, the, little, dipper, because, its, seven, brightest, stars, seem, to, form, the, shape, of, a, dipper, ladle, or, scoop, the, star, at, the, end, of, the, dipper, handle, is, polaris, polaris, can, also, be, found, by, following, a, line, through, the, two, stars, alpha, and, beta, ursae, majoris, popularly, called, the, pointers, that, form, the, end, of, the, bowl, of, the, big, dipper, for, 30, degrees, three, upright, fists, at, arms, length, across, the, night, sky, the, four, stars, constituting, the, bowl, of, the, little, dipper, are, of, second, third, fourth, and, fifth, magnitudes, respectively, and, provide, an, easy, guide, to, determining, what, magnitude, stars, are, visible, useful, for, city, dwellers, or, testing, one, s, eyesight, the, three, letter, abbreviation, for, the, constellation, as, adopted, by, the, iau, international, astronomical, union, in, 1922, is, umi, the, official, constellation, boundaries, as, set, by, belgian, astronomer, eug, ne, delporte, in, 1930, are, defined, by, a, polygon, of, 22, segments, illustrated, in, infobox, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, right, ascension, coordinates, of, these, borders, lie, between, 08, h, 41, 4, m, and, 22, h, 54, 0, m, while, the, declination, coordinates, range, from, the, north, celestial, pole, to, 65, 40, in, the, south, its, position, in, the, far, northern, celestial, hemisphere, means, that, the, whole, constellation, is, visible, only, to, observers, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, german, cartographer, johann, bayer, used, the, greek, letters, alpha, to, theta, to, label, the, most, prominent, stars, in, the, constellation, while, his, countryman, johann, elert, bode, subsequently, added, iota, through, phi, only, lambda, and, pi, remain, in, use, likely, because, of, their, proximity, to, the, north, celestial, pole, within, the, constellation, s, borders, there, are, 39, stars, brighter, than, or, equal, to, apparent, magnitude, 6, 5, the, traditional, names, of, the, main, seven, in, johann, bayer, s, ordering, are, marking, the, little, bear, s, tail, polaris, or, alpha, ursae, minoris, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, varying, between, apparent, magnitudes, 1, 97, and, 2, 00, over, a, period, of, 3, 97, days, located, around, 432, light, years, away, from, earth, it,

used, up, the, hydrogen, in, its, core, and, moved, off, the, main, sequence, of, spectral, type, k4iii, slightly, variable, over, a, period, of, 4, 6, days, kochab, has, had, its, mass, estimated, at, 1, 3, times, that, of, the, sun, via, measurement, of, these, oscillations, kochab, is, 450, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, and, has, 42, times, its, diameter, with, a, surface, temperature, of, approximately, 4, 130, k, estimated, to, be, around, 2, 95, billion, years, old, 1, billion, years, kochab, was, announced, to, have, a, planetary, companion, around, 6, 1, times, as, massive, as, jupiter, with, an, orbit, of, 522, days, traditionally, known, as, pherkad, gamma, ursae, minoris, has, an, apparent, magnitude, that, varies, between, 3, 04, and, 3, 09, roughly, every,

by, the, wide, field, infrared, survey, explorer, wise, in, 2011, kochab, aside, three, more, stellar, systems, have, been, discovered, to, contain, planets, 11, ursae, minoris, is, an, orange, giant, of, spectral, type, k4iii, around, 1, 8, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, around, 1, 5, billion, years, old, it, has, cooled, and, expanded, since, it, was, an, a, type, main, sequence, star, around, 390, light, years, distant, it, shines, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 5, 04, a, planet, around, 11, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, was, discovered, in, 2009, orbiting, the, star, with, a, period, of, 516, days, hd, 120084, is, another, evolved, star, a, yellow, giant, of, spectral, type, g7iii, around, 2, 4, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, it, has, a, planet, 4, 5, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, with, one, of, the, most, eccentric, planetary, orbits, e, 0, 66, discovered, by, precisely, measuring, the, radial, velocity, of, the, star, in, 2013, hd, 150706, is, a, sunlike, star, of, spectral, type, g0v, some, 89, light, years, distant, from, the, solar, system, it, was, thought, to, have, a, planet, as, massive, as, jupiter, at, a, distance, of, 0, 6, au, but, this, was, discounted, in, 2007, a, further, study, published, in, 2012, showed, that, it, has, a, companion, around, 2, 7, times, as, massive, as, jupiter, that, takes, around, 16, years, to, complete, an, orbit, and, is, 6, 8, au, distant, from, its, star, ursa, minor, is, rather, devoid, of, deep, sky, objects, the, ursa, minor, dwarf, a, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxy, was, discovered, by, albert, george, wilson, of, the, lowell, observatory, in, the, palomar, sky, survey, in, 1955, its, centre, is, around, 225, 000, light, years, distant, from, earth, in, 1999, kenneth, mighell, and, christopher, burke, used, the, hubble, space, telescope, to, confirm, that, the, galaxy, had, had, a, single, burst, of, star, formation, that, took, place, around, 14, billion, years, ago, and, lasted, around, 2, billion, years, and, that, the, galaxy, was, probably, as, old, as, the, milky, way, itself, ngc, 3172, also, known, as, polarissima, borealis, is, a, faint, magnitude, 14, 9, galaxy, that, happens, to, be, the, closest, ngc, object, to, the, north, celestial, pole, it, was, discovered, by, john, herschel, in, 1831, ngc, 6217, is, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, located, some, 67, million, light, years, away, which, can, be, located, with, a, 10, cm, 4, in, or, larger, telescope, as, an, 11th, magnitude, object, about, 2, 5, east, northeast, of, zeta, ursae, minoris, it, has, been, characterized, as, a, starburst, galaxy, which, means, it, is, undergoing, a, high, rate, of, star, formation, compared, with, a, typical, galaxy, ngc, 6251, is, an, active, supergiant, elliptical, radio, galaxy, more, than, 340, million, light, years, away, from, earth, it, has, a, seyfert, 2, active, galactic, nucleus, and, is, one, of, the, most, extreme, examples, of, a, seyfert, galaxy, this, galaxy, may, be, associated, with, gamma, ray, source, 3eg, j1621, 8203, which, has, high, energy, gamma, ray, emission, it, is, also, noted, for, its, one, sided, radio, jet, one, of, the, brightest, known, discovered, in, 1977, the, ursids, a, prominent, meteor, shower, that, occurs, in, ursa, minor, peaks, between, december, 18, and, 25, its, parent, body, is, the, comet, 8p, tuttle
