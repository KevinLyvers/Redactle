the, astronomical, unit, symbol, au, or, au, is, a, unit, of, length, defined, to, be, exactly, equal, to, 149, 597, 870, 700, m, historically, the, astronomical, unit, was, conceived, as, the, average, earth, sun, distance, the, average, of, earth, s, aphelion, and, perihelion, before, its, modern, redefinition, in, 2012, the, astronomical, unit, is, used, primarily, for, measuring, distances, within, the, solar, system, or, around, other, stars, it, is, also, a, fundamental, component, in, the, definition, of, another, unit, of, astronomical, length, the, parsec, one, au, is, equivalent, to, 499, light, seconds, to, within, 10, parts, per, million, a, variety, of, unit, symbols, and, abbreviations, have, been, in, use, for, the, astronomical, unit, in, a, 1976, resolution, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, had, used, the, symbol, a, to, denote, a, length, equal, to, the, astronomical, unit, in, the, astronomical, literature, the, symbol, au, is, common, in, 2006, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, had, recommended, ua, as, the, symbol, for, the, unit, from, the, french, unit, astronomique, in, the, non, normative, annex, c, to, iso, 80000, 3, 2006, later, withdrawn, the, symbol, of, the, astronomical, unit, was, also, ua, in, 2012, the, iau, noting, that, various, symbols, are, presently, in, use, for, the, astronomical, unit, recommended, the, use, of, the, symbol, au, the, scientific, journals, published, by, the, american, astronomical, society, and, the, royal, astronomical, society, subsequently, adopted, this, symbol, in, the, 2014, revision, and, 2019, edition, of, the, si, brochure, the, bipm, used, the, unit, symbol, au, iso, 80000, 3, 2019, which, replaces, iso, 80000, 3, 2006, does, not, mention, the, astronomical, unit, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, is, an, ellipse, the, semi, major, axis, of, this, elliptic, orbit, is, defined, to, be, half, of, the, straight, line, segment, that, joins, the, perihelion, and, aphelion, the, centre, of, the, sun, lies, on, this, straight, line, segment, but, not, at, its, midpoint, because, ellipses, are, well, understood, shapes, measuring, the, points, of, its, extremes, defined, the, exact, shape, mathematically, and, made, possible, calculations, for, the, entire, orbit, as, well, as, predictions, based, on, observation, in, addition, it, mapped, out, exactly, the, largest, straight, line, distance, that, earth, traverses, over, the, course, of, a, year, defining, times, and, places, for, observing, the, largest, parallax, apparent, shifts, of, position, in, nearby, stars, knowing, earth, s, shift, and, a, star, s, shift, enabled, the, star, s, distance, to, be, calculated, but, all, measurements, are, subject, to, some, degree, of, error, or, uncertainty, and, the, uncertainties, in, the, length, of, the, astronomical, unit, only, increased, uncertainties, in, the, stellar, distances, improvements, in, precision, have, always, been, a, key, to, improving, astronomical, understanding, throughout, the, twentieth, century, measurements, became, increasingly, precise, and, sophisticated, and, ever, more, dependent, on, accurate, observation, of, the, effects, described, by, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, and, upon, the, mathematical, tools, it, used, improving, measurements, were, continually, checked, and, cross, checked, by, means, of, improved, understanding, of, the, laws, of, celestial, mechanics, which, govern, the, motions, of, objects, in, space, the, expected, positions, and, distances, of, objects, at, an, established, time, are, calculated, in, au, from, these, laws, and, assembled, into, a, collection, of, data, called, an, ephemeris, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, horizons, system, provides, one, of, several, ephemeris, computation, services, in, 1976, to, establish, an, even, precise, measure, for, the, astronomical, unit, the, iau, formally, adopted, a, new, definition, although, directly, based, on, the, then, best, available, observational, measurements, the, definition, was, recast, in, terms, of, the, then, best, mathematical, derivations, from, celestial, mechanics, and, planetary, ephemerides, it, stated, that, the, astronomical, unit, of, length, is, that, length, a, for, which, the, gaussian, gravitational, constant, k, takes, the, value, 0, 017, 202, 098, 95, when, the, units, of, measurement, are, the, astronomical, units, of, length, mass, and, time, equivalently, by, this, definition, one, au, is, the, radius, of, an, unperturbed, circular, newtonian, orbit, about, the, sun, of, a, particle, having, infinitesimal, mass, moving, with, an, angular, frequency, of, 0, 017, 202, 098, 95, radians, per, day, or, alternatively, that, length, for, which, the, heliocentric, gravitational, constant, the, product, g, m, is, equal, to, 0, 017, 202, 098, 95, 2, au, 3, d, 2, when, the, length, is, used, to, describe, the, positions, of, objects, in, the, solar, system, subsequent, explorations, of, the, solar, system, by, space, probes, made, it, possible, to, obtain, precise, measurements, of, the, relative, positions, of, the, inner, planets, and, other, objects, by, means, of, radar, and, telemetry, as, with, all, radar, measurements, these, rely, on, measuring, the, time, taken, for, photons, to, be, reflected, from, an, object, because, all, photons, move, at, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, a, fundamental, constant, of, the, universe, the, distance, of, an, object, from, the, probe, is, calculated, as, the, product, of, the, speed, of, light, and, the, measured, time, however, for, precision, the, calculations, require, adjustment, for, things, such, as, the, motions, of, the, probe, and, object, while, the, photons, are, transiting, in, addition, the, measurement, of, the, time, itself, must, be, translated, to, a, standard, scale, that, accounts, for, relativistic, time, dilation, comparison, of, the, ephemeris, positions, with, time, measurements, expressed, in, barycentric, dynamical, time, tdb, leads, to, a, value, for, the, speed, of, light, in, astronomical, units, per, day, of, 86, 400, s, by, 2009, the, iau, had, updated, its, standard, measures, to, reflect, improvements, and, calculated, the, speed, of, light, at, 173, 144, 632, 6847, 69, au, d, tdb, in, 1983, the, cipm, modified, the, international, system, of, units, si, to, make, the, metre, defined, as, the, distance, travelled, in, a, vacuum, by, light, in, 1, 299, 792, 458, s, this, replaced, the, previous, definition, valid, between, 1960, and, 1983, which, was, that, the, metre, equalled, a, certain, number, of, wavelengths, of, a, certain, emission, line, of, krypton, 86, the, reason, for, the, change, was, an, improved, method, of, measuring, the, speed, of, light, the, speed, of, light, could, then, be, expressed, exactly, as, c, 0, 299, 792, 458, m, s, a, standard, also, adopted, by, the, iers, numerical, standards, from, this, definition, and, the, 2009, iau, standard, the, time, for, light, to, traverse, an, astronomical, unit, is, found, to, be, a, 499, 004, 783, 8061, 0, 000, 000, 01, s, which, is, slightly, more, than, 8, minutes, 19, seconds, by, multiplication, the, best, iau, 2009, estimate, was, a, c, 0, a, 149, 597, 870, 700, 3, m, based, on, a, comparison, of, jet, propulsion, laboratory, and, iaa, ras, ephemerides, in, 2006, the, bipm, reported, a, value, of, the, astronomical, unit, as, 1, 495, 978, 706, 91, 6, 10, 11, m, in, the, 2014, revision, of, the, si, brochure, the, bipm, recognised, the, iau, s, 2012, redefinition, of, the, astronomical, unit, as, 149, 597, 870, 700, m, this, estimate, was, still, derived, from, observation, and, measurements, subject, to, error, and, based, on, techniques, that, did, not, yet, standardize, all, relativistic, effects, and, thus, were, not, constant, for, all, observers, in, 2012, finding, that, the, equalization, of, relativity, alone, would, make, the, definition, overly, complex, the, iau, simply, used, the, 2009, estimate, to, redefine, the, astronomical, unit, as, a, conventional, unit, of, length, directly, tied, to, the, metre, exactly, 149, 597, 870, 700, m, the, new, definition, recognizes, as, a, consequence, that, the, astronomical, unit, has, reduced, importance, limited, in, use, to, a, convenience, in, some, applications, this, definition, makes, the, speed, of, light, defined, as, exactly, 299, 792, 458, m, s, equal, to, exactly, 299, 792, 458, 86, 400, 149, 597, 870, 700, or, about, 173, 144, 632, 674, 240, au, d, some, 60, parts, per, trillion, less, than, the, 2009, estimate, with, the, definitions, used, before, 2012, the, astronomical, unit, was, dependent, on, the, heliocentric, gravitational, constant, that, is, the, product, of, the, gravitational, constant, g, and, the, solar, mass, m, neither, g, nor, m, can, be, measured, to, high, accuracy, separately, but, the, value, of, their, product, is, known, very, precisely, from, observing, the, relative, positions, of, planets, kepler, s, third, law, expressed, in, terms, of, newtonian, gravitation, only, the, product, is, required, to, calculate, planetary, positions, for, an, ephemeris, so, ephemerides, are, calculated, in, astronomical, units, and, not, in, si, units, the, calculation, of, ephemerides, also, requires, a, consideration, of, the, effects, of, general, relativity, in, particular, time, intervals, measured, on, earth, s, surface, terrestrial, time, tt, are, not, constant, when, compared, with, the, motions, of, the, planets, the, terrestrial, second, tt, appears, to, be, longer, near, january, and, shorter, near, july, when, compared, with, the, planetary, second, conventionally, measured, in, tdb, this, is, because, the, distance, between, earth, and, the, sun, is, not, fixed, it, varies, between, 0, 983, 289, 8912, and, 1, 016, 710, 3335, au, and, when, earth, is, closer, to, the, sun, perihelion, the, sun, s, gravitational, field, is, stronger, and, earth, is, moving, faster, along, its, orbital, path, as, the, metre, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, second, and, the, speed, of, light, is, constant, for, all, observers, the, terrestrial, metre, appears, to, change, in, length, compared, with, the, planetary, metre, on, a, periodic, basis, the, metre, is, defined, to, be, a, unit, of, proper, length, indeed, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, notes, that, its, definition, applies, only, within, a, spatial, extent, sufficiently, small, that, the, effects, of, the, non, uniformity, of, the, gravitational, field, can, be, ignored, as, such, a, distance, within, the, solar, system, without, specifying, the, frame, of, reference, for, the, measurement, is, problematic, the, 1976, definition, of, the, astronomical, unit, was, incomplete, because, it, did, not, specify, the, frame, of, reference, in, which, to, apply, the, measurement, but, proved, practical, for, the, calculation, of, ephemerides, a, fuller, definition, that, is, consistent, with, general, relativity, was, proposed, and, vigorous, debate, ensued, until, august, 2012, when, the, iau, adopted, the, current, definition, of, 1, astronomical, unit, 149, 597, 870, 700, metres, the, astronomical, unit, is, typically, used, for, stellar, system, scale, distances, such, as, the, size, of, a, protostellar, disk, or, the, heliocentric, distance, of, an, asteroid, whereas, other, units, are, used, for, other, distances, in, astronomy, the, astronomical, unit, is, too, small, to, be, convenient, for, interstellar, distances, where, the, parsec, and, light, year, are, widely, used, the, parsec, parallax, arcsecond, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, astronomical, unit, being, the, distance, of, an, object, with, a, parallax, of, 1, the, light, year, is, often, used, in, popular, works, but, is, not, an, approved, non, si, unit, and, is, rarely, used, by, professional, astronomers, when, simulating, a, numerical, model, of, the, solar, system, the, astronomical, unit, provides, an, appropriate, scale, that, minimizes, overflow, underflow, and, truncation, errors, in, floating, point, calculations, the, book, on, the, sizes, and, distances, of, the, sun, and, moon, which, is, ascribed, to, aristarchus, says, the, distance, to, the, sun, is, 18, to, 20, times, the, distance, to, the, moon, whereas, the, true, ratio, is, about, 389, 174, the, latter, estimate, was, based, on, the, angle, between, the, half, moon, and, the, sun, which, he, estimated, as, 87, the, true, value, being, close, to, 89, 853, depending, on, the, distance, that, van, helden, assumes, aristarchus, used, for, the, distance, to, the, moon, his, calculated, distance, to, the, sun, would, fall, between, 380, and, 1, 520, earth, radii, according, to, eusebius, in, the, praeparatio, evangelica, book, xv, chapter, 53, eratosthenes, found, the, distance, to, the, sun, to, be, literally, of, stadia, myriads, 400, and, 80, 000, but, with, the, additional, note, that, in, the, greek, text, the, grammatical, agreement, is, between, myriads, not, stadia, on, the, one, hand, and, both, 400, and, 80, 000, on, the, other, all, three, are, accusative, plural, while, is, genitive, plural, of, stadia, all, three, words, or, all, four, including, stadia, are, inflected, this, has, been, translated, either, as, 4, 080, 000, stadia, 1903, translation, by, edwin, hamilton, gifford, or, as, 804, 000, 000, stadia, edition, of, dourad, des, places, dated, 1974, 1991, using, the, greek, stadium, of, 185, to, 190, metres, the, former, translation, comes, to, 754, 800, km, to, 775, 200, km, which, is, far, too, low, whereas, the, second, translation, comes, to, 148, 7, to, 152, 8, billion, metres, accurate, within, 2, hipparchus, also, gave, an, estimate, of, the, distance, of, earth, from, the, sun, quoted, by, pappus, as, equal, to, 490, earth, radii, according, to, the, conjectural, reconstructions, of, noel, swerdlow, and, g, j, toomer, this, was, derived, from, his, assumption, of, a, least, perceptible, solar, parallax, of, 7, a, chinese, mathematical, treatise, the, zhoubi, suanjing, c, 1st, century, bce, shows, how, the, distance, to, the, sun, can, be, computed, geometrically, using, the, different, lengths, of, the, noontime, shadows, observed, at, three, places, 1, 000, li, apart, and, the, assumption, that, earth, is, flat, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, ptolemy, estimated, the, mean, distance, of, the, sun, as, 1, 210, times, earth, s, radius, to, determine, this, value, ptolemy, started, by, measuring, the, moon, s, parallax, finding, what, amounted, to, a, horizontal, lunar, parallax, of, 1, 26, which, was, much, too, large, he, then, derived, a, maximum, lunar, distance, of, 64, 1, 6, earth, radii, because, of, cancelling, errors, in, his, parallax, figure, his, theory, of, the, moon, s, orbit, and, other, factors, this, figure, was, approximately, correct, he, then, measured, the, apparent, sizes, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, and, concluded, that, the, apparent, diameter, of, the, sun, was, equal, to, the, apparent, diameter, of, the, moon, at, the, moon, s, greatest, distance, and, from, records, of, lunar, eclipses, he, estimated, this, apparent, diameter, as, well, as, the, apparent, diameter, of, the, shadow, cone, of, earth, traversed, by, the, moon, during, a, lunar, eclipse, given, these, data, the, distance, of, the, sun, from, earth, can, be, trigonometrically, computed, to, be, 1, 210, earth, radii, this, gives, a, ratio, of, solar, to, lunar, distance, of, approximately, 19, matching, aristarchus, s, figure, although, ptolemy, s, procedure, is, theoretically, workable, it, is, very, sensitive, to, small, changes, in, the, data, so, much, so, that, changing, a, measurement, by, a, few, per, cent, can, make, the, solar, distance, infinite, after, greek, astronomy, was, transmitted, to, the, medieval, islamic, world, astronomers, made, some, changes, to, ptolemy, s, cosmological, model, but, did, not, greatly, change, his, estimate, of, the, earth, sun, distance, for, example, in, his, introduction, to, ptolemaic, astronomy, al, fargh, n, gave, a, mean, solar, distance, of, 1, 170, earth, radii, whereas, in, his, zij, al, batt, n, used, a, mean, solar, distance, of, 1, 108, earth, radii, subsequent, astronomers, such, as, al, b, r, n, used, similar, values, later, in, europe, copernicus, and, tycho, brahe, also, used, comparable, figures, 1, 142, and, 1, 150, earth, radii, and, so, ptolemy, s, approximate, earth, sun, distance, survived, through, the, 16th, century, johannes, kepler, was, the, first, to, realize, that, ptolemy, s, estimate, must, be, significantly, too, low, according, to, kepler, at, least, by, a, factor, of, three, in, his, rudolphine, tables, 1627, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, allowed, astronomers, to, calculate, the, relative, distances, of, the, planets, from, the, sun, and, rekindled, interest, in, measuring, the, absolute, value, for, earth, which, could, then, be, applied, to, the, other, planets, the, invention, of, the, telescope, allowed, far, more, accurate, measurements, of, angles, than, is, possible, with, the, naked, eye, flemish, astronomer, godefroy, wendelin, repeated, aristarchus, measurements, in, 1635, and, found, that, ptolemy, s, value, was, too, low, by, a, factor, of, at, least, eleven, a, somewhat, more, accurate, estimate, can, be, obtained, by, observing, the, transit, of, venus, by, measuring, the, transit, in, two, different, locations, one, can, accurately, calculate, the, parallax, of, venus, and, from, the, relative, distance, of, earth, and, venus, from, the, sun, the, solar, parallax, which, cannot, be, measured, directly, due, to, the, brightness, of, the, sun, jeremiah, horrocks, had, attempted, to, produce, an, estimate, based, on, his, observation, of, the, 1639, transit, published, in, 1662, giving, a, solar, parallax, of, 15, similar, to, wendelin, s, figure, the, solar, parallax, is, related, to, the, earth, sun, distance, as, measured, in, earth, radii, by, the, smaller, the, solar, parallax, the, greater, the, distance, between, the, sun, and, earth, a, solar, parallax, of, 15, is, equivalent, to, an, earth, sun, distance, of, 13, 750, earth, radii, christiaan, huygens, believed, that, the, distance, was, even, greater, by, comparing, the, apparent, sizes, of, venus, and, mars, he, estimated, a, value, of, about, 24, 000, earth, radii, equivalent, to, a, solar, parallax, of, 8, 6, although, huygens, estimate, is, remarkably, close, to, modern, values, it, is, often, discounted, by, historians, of, astronomy, because, of, the, many, unproven, and, incorrect, assumptions, he, had, to, make, for, his, method, to, work, the, accuracy, of, his, value, seems, to, be, based, more, on, luck, than, good, measurement, with, his, various, errors, cancelling, each, other, out, jean, richer, and, giovanni, domenico, cassini, measured, the, parallax, of, mars, between, paris, and, cayenne, in, french, guiana, when, mars, was, at, its, closest, to, earth, in, 1672, they, arrived, at, a, figure, for, the, solar, parallax, of, 9, 5, equivalent, to, an, earth, sun, distance, of, about, 22, 000, earth, radii, they, were, also, the, first, astronomers, to, have, access, to, an, accurate, and, reliable, value, for, the, radius, of, earth, which, had, been, measured, by, their, colleague, jean, picard, in, 1669, as, 3, 269, 000, toises, this, same, year, saw, another, estimate, for, the, astronomical, unit, by, john, flamsteed, which, accomplished, it, alone, by, measuring, the, martian, diurnal, parallax, another, colleague, ole, r, mer, discovered, the, finite, speed, of, light, in, 1676, the, speed, was, so, great, that, it, was, usually, quoted, as, the, time, required, for, light, to, travel, from, the, sun, to, the, earth, or, light, time, per, unit, distance, a, convention, that, is, still, followed, by, astronomers, today, a, better, method, for, observing, venus, transits, was, devised, by, james, gregory, and, published, in, his, optica, promata, 1663, it, was, strongly, advocated, by, edmond, halley, and, was, applied, to, the, transits, of, venus, observed, in, 1761, and, 1769, and, then, again, in, 1874, and, 1882, transits, of, venus, occur, in, pairs, but, less, than, one, pair, every, century, and, observing, the, transits, in, 1761, and, 1769, was, an, unprecedented, international, scientific, operation, including, observations, by, james, cook, and, charles, green, from, tahiti, despite, the, seven, years, war, dozens, of, astronomers, were, dispatched, to, observing, points, around, the, world, at, great, expense, and, personal, danger, several, of, them, died, in, the, endeavour, the, various, results, were, collated, by, j, r, me, lalande, to, give, a, figure, for, the, solar, parallax, of, 8, 6, karl, rudolph, powalky, had, made, an, estimate, of, 8, 83, in, 1864, another, method, involved, determining, the, constant, of, aberration, simon, newcomb, gave, great, weight, to, this, method, when, deriving, his, widely, accepted, value, of, 8, 80, for, the, solar, parallax, close, to, the, modern, value, of, 8, 794, 143, although, newcomb, also, used, data, from, the, transits, of, venus, newcomb, also, collaborated, with, a, a, michelson, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, with, earth, based, equipment, combined, with, the, constant, of, aberration, which, is, related, to, the, light, time, per, unit, distance, this, gave, the, first, direct, measurement, of, the, earth, sun, distance, in, metres, newcomb, s, value, for, the, solar, parallax, and, for, the, constant, of, aberration, and, the, gaussian, gravitational, constant, were, incorporated, into, the, first, international, system, of, astronomical, constants, in, 1896, which, remained, in, place, for, the, calculation, of, ephemerides, until, 1964, the, name, astronomical, unit, appears, first, to, have, been, used, in, 1903, the, discovery, of, the, near, earth, asteroid, 433, eros, and, its, passage, near, earth, in, 1900, 1901, allowed, a, considerable, improvement, in, parallax, measurement, another, international, project, to, measure, the, parallax, of, 433, eros, was, undertaken, in, 1930, 1931, direct, radar, measurements, of, the, distances, to, venus, and, mars, became, available, in, the, early, 1960s, along, with, improved, measurements, of, the, speed, of, light, these, showed, that, newcomb, s, values, for, the, solar, parallax, and, the, constant, of, aberration, were, inconsistent, with, one, another, the, unit, distance, a, the, value, of, the, astronomical, unit, in, metres, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, other, astronomical, constants, where, g, is, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, m, is, the, solar, mass, k, is, the, numerical, value, of, gaussian, gravitational, constant, and, d, is, the, time, period, of, one, day, the, sun, is, constantly, losing, mass, by, radiating, away, energy, so, the, orbits, of, the, planets, are, steadily, expanding, outward, from, the, sun, this, has, led, to, calls, to, abandon, the, astronomical, unit, as, a, unit, of, measurement, as, the, speed, of, light, has, an, exact, defined, value, in, si, units, and, the, gaussian, gravitational, constant, k, is, fixed, in, the, astronomical, system, of, units, measuring, the, light, time, per, unit, distance, is, exactly, equivalent, to, measuring, the, product, g, m, in, si, units, hence, it, is, possible, to, construct, ephemerides, entirely, in, si, units, which, is, increasingly, becoming, the, norm, a, 2004, analysis, of, radiometric, measurements, in, the, inner, solar, system, suggested, that, the, secular, increase, in, the, unit, distance, was, much, larger, than, can, be, accounted, for, by, solar, radiation, 15, 4, metres, per, century, the, measurements, of, the, secular, variations, of, the, astronomical, unit, are, not, confirmed, by, other, authors, and, are, quite, controversial, furthermore, since, 2010, the, astronomical, unit, has, not, been, estimated, by, the, planetary, ephemerides, the, following, table, contains, some, distances, given, in, astronomical, units, it, includes, some, examples, with, distances, that, are, normally, not, given, in, astronomical, units, because, they, are, either, too, short, or, far, too, long, distances, normally, change, over, time, examples, are, listed, by, increasing, distance
