approximately, 251, 9, million, years, ago, the, permian, triassic, p, t, p, tr, extinction, event, ptme, also, known, as, the, late, permian, extinction, event, the, latest, permian, extinction, event, the, end, permian, extinction, event, and, colloquially, as, the, great, dying, forms, the, boundary, between, the, permian, and, triassic, geologic, periods, and, with, them, the, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, eras, it, is, earth, s, most, severe, known, extinction, event, with, the, extinction, of, 57, of, biological, families, 83, of, genera, 81, of, marine, species, and, 70, of, terrestrial, vertebrate, species, it, is, also, the, greatest, known, mass, extinction, of, insects, it, is, the, greatest, of, the, big, five, mass, extinctions, of, the, phanerozoic, there, is, evidence, for, one, to, three, distinct, pulses, or, phases, of, extinction, the, precise, causes, of, the, great, dying, remain, uncertain, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, the, main, cause, of, extinction, was, the, flood, basalt, volcanic, eruptions, that, created, the, siberian, traps, which, released, sulfur, dioxide, and, carbon, dioxide, resulting, in, euxinia, oxygen, starved, sulfurous, oceans, elevating, global, temperatures, and, acidifying, the, oceans, the, level, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, rose, from, around, 400, ppm, to, 2, 500, ppm, with, approximately, 3, 900, to, 12, 000, gigatonnes, of, carbon, being, added, to, the, ocean, atmosphere, system, during, this, period, several, other, contributing, factors, have, been, proposed, including, the, emission, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, burning, of, oil, and, coal, deposits, ignited, by, the, eruptions, emissions, of, methane, from, the, gasification, of, methane, clathrates, emissions, of, methane, by, novel, methanogenic, microorganisms, nourished, by, minerals, dispersed, in, the, eruptions, longer, and, more, intense, el, ni, o, events, and, an, extraterrestrial, impact, which, created, the, araguainha, crater, and, caused, seismic, release, of, methane, and, the, destruction, of, the, ozone, layer, with, increased, exposure, to, solar, radiation, previously, it, was, thought, that, rock, sequences, spanning, the, permian, triassic, boundary, were, too, few, and, contained, too, many, gaps, for, scientists, to, reliably, determine, its, details, however, it, is, now, possible, to, date, the, extinction, with, millennial, precision, u, pb, zircon, dates, from, five, volcanic, ash, beds, from, the, global, stratotype, section, and, point, for, the, permian, triassic, boundary, at, meishan, china, establish, a, high, resolution, age, model, for, the, extinction, allowing, exploration, of, the, links, between, global, environmental, perturbation, carbon, cycle, disruption, mass, extinction, and, recovery, at, millennial, timescales, the, first, appearance, of, the, conodont, hindeodus, parvus, has, been, used, to, delineate, the, permian, triassic, boundary, the, extinction, occurred, between, 251, 941, 0, 037, and, 251, 880, 0, 031, million, years, ago, a, duration, of, 60, 48, thousand, years, a, large, abrupt, global, decrease, in, 13, c, the, ratio, of, the, stable, isotope, carbon, 13, to, that, of, carbon, 12, coincides, with, this, extinction, and, is, sometimes, used, to, identify, the, permian, triassic, boundary, and, ptme, in, rocks, that, are, unsuitable, for, radiometric, dating, the, negative, carbon, isotope, excursion, s, magnitude, was, 4, 7, and, lasted, for, approximately, 500, kyr, though, estimating, its, exact, value, is, challenging, due, to, diagenetic, alteration, of, many, sedimentary, facies, spanning, the, boundary, further, evidence, for, environmental, change, around, the, permian, triassic, boundary, suggests, an, 8, c, 14, f, rise, in, temperature, and, an, increase, in, co, 2, levels, to, 2, 500, ppm, for, comparison, the, concentration, immediately, before, the, industrial, revolution, was, 280, ppm, and, the, amount, today, is, about, 422, ppm, there, is, also, evidence, of, increased, ultraviolet, radiation, reaching, the, earth, causing, the, mutation, of, plant, spores, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, permian, triassic, boundary, is, associated, with, a, sharp, increase, in, the, abundance, of, marine, and, terrestrial, fungi, caused, by, the, sharp, increase, in, the, amount, of, dead, plants, and, animals, fed, upon, by, the, fungi, this, fungal, spike, has, been, used, by, some, paleontologists, to, identify, a, lithological, sequence, as, being, on, or, very, close, to, the, permian, triassic, boundary, in, rocks, that, are, unsuitable, for, radiometric, dating, or, have, a, lack, of, suitable, index, fossils, however, even, the, proposers, of, the, fungal, spike, hypothesis, pointed, out, that, fungal, spikes, may, have, been, a, repeating, phenomenon, created, by, the, post, extinction, ecosystem, during, the, earliest, triassic, the, very, idea, of, a, fungal, spike, has, been, criticized, on, several, grounds, including, reduviasporonites, the, most, common, supposed, fungal, spore, may, be, a, fossilized, alga, the, spike, did, not, appear, worldwide, and, in, many, places, it, did, not, fall, on, the, permian, triassic, boundary, the, reduviasporonites, may, even, represent, a, transition, to, a, lake, dominated, triassic, world, rather, than, an, earliest, triassic, zone, of, death, and, decay, in, some, terrestrial, fossil, beds, newer, chemical, evidence, agrees, better, with, a, fungal, origin, for, reduviasporonites, diluting, these, critiques, uncertainty, exists, regarding, the, duration, of, the, overall, extinction, and, about, the, timing, and, duration, of, various, groups, extinctions, within, the, greater, process, some, evidence, suggests, that, there, were, multiple, extinction, pulses, or, that, the, extinction, was, long, and, spread, out, over, a, few, million, years, with, a, sharp, peak, in, the, last, million, years, of, the, permian, statistical, analyses, of, some, highly, fossiliferous, strata, in, meishan, zhejiang, province, in, southeastern, china, suggest, that, the, main, extinction, was, clustered, around, one, peak, while, a, study, of, the, liangfengya, section, found, evidence, of, two, extinction, waves, meh, 1, and, meh, 2, which, varied, in, their, causes, and, a, study, of, the, shangsi, section, showed, two, extinction, pulses, with, different, causes, too, recent, research, shows, that, different, groups, became, extinct, at, different, times, for, example, while, difficult, to, date, absolutely, ostracod, and, brachiopod, extinctions, were, separated, by, around, 670, 000, to, 1, 17, million, years, palaeoenvironmental, analysis, of, lopingian, strata, in, the, bowen, basin, of, queensland, indicates, numerous, intermittent, periods, of, marine, environmental, stress, from, the, middle, to, late, lopingian, leading, up, to, the, end, permian, extinction, proper, supporting, aspects, of, the, gradualist, hypothesis, additionally, the, decline, in, marine, species, richness, and, the, structural, collapse, of, marine, ecosystems, may, have, been, decoupled, as, well, with, the, former, preceding, the, latter, by, about, 61, 000, years, according, to, one, study, whether, the, terrestrial, and, marine, extinctions, were, synchronous, or, asynchronous, is, another, point, of, controversy, evidence, from, a, well, preserved, sequence, in, east, greenland, suggests, that, the, terrestrial, and, marine, extinctions, began, simultaneously, in, this, sequence, the, decline, of, animal, life, is, concentrated, in, a, period, approximately, 10, 000, to, 60, 000, years, long, with, plants, taking, an, additional, several, hundred, thousand, years, to, show, the, full, impact, of, the, event, many, sedimentary, sequences, from, south, china, show, synchronous, terrestrial, and, marine, extinctions, research, in, the, sydney, basin, of, the, ptme, s, duration, and, course, also, supports, a, synchronous, occurrence, of, the, terrestrial, and, marine, biotic, collapses, other, scientists, believe, the, terrestrial, mass, extinction, began, between, 60, 000, and, 370, 000, years, before, the, onset, of, the, marine, mass, extinction, chemostratigraphic, analysis, from, sections, in, finnmark, and, tr, ndelag, shows, the, terrestrial, floral, turnover, occurred, before, the, large, negative, 13, c, shift, during, the, marine, extinction, dating, of, the, boundary, between, the, dicynodon, and, lystrosaurus, assemblage, zones, in, the, karoo, basin, indicates, that, the, terrestrial, extinction, occurred, earlier, than, the, marine, extinction, the, sunjiagou, formation, of, south, china, also, records, a, terrestrial, ecosystem, demise, predating, the, marine, crisis, other, research, still, has, found, that, the, terrestrial, extinction, occurred, after, the, marine, extinction, in, the, tropics, studies, of, the, timing, and, causes, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, are, complicated, by, the, often, overlooked, capitanian, extinction, also, called, the, guadalupian, extinction, just, one, of, perhaps, two, mass, extinctions, in, the, late, permian, that, closely, preceded, the, permian, triassic, event, in, short, when, the, permian, triassic, starts, it, is, difficult, to, know, whether, the, end, capitanian, had, finished, depending, on, the, factor, considered, many, of, the, extinctions, once, dated, to, the, permian, triassic, boundary, have, more, recently, been, redated, to, the, end, capitanian, further, it, is, unclear, whether, some, species, who, survived, the, prior, extinction, s, had, recovered, well, enough, for, their, final, demise, in, the, permian, triassic, event, to, be, considered, separate, from, capitanian, event, a, minority, point, of, view, considers, the, sequence, of, environmental, disasters, to, have, effectively, constituted, a, single, prolonged, extinction, event, perhaps, depending, on, which, species, is, considered, this, older, theory, still, supported, in, some, recent, papers, proposes, that, there, were, two, major, extinction, pulses, 9, 4, million, years, apart, separated, by, a, period, of, extinctions, that, were, less, extensive, but, still, well, above, the, background, level, and, that, the, final, extinction, killed, off, only, about, 80, of, marine, species, alive, at, that, time, whereas, the, other, losses, occurred, during, the, first, pulse, or, the, interval, between, pulses, according, to, this, theory, one, of, these, extinction, pulses, occurred, at, the, end, of, the, guadalupian, epoch, of, the, permian, for, example, all, dinocephalian, genera, died, out, at, the, end, of, the, guadalupian, as, did, the, verbeekinidae, a, family, of, large, size, fusuline, foraminifera, the, impact, of, the, end, guadalupian, extinction, on, marine, organisms, appears, to, have, varied, between, locations, and, between, taxonomic, groups, brachiopods, and, corals, had, severe, losses, marine, invertebrates, suffered, the, greatest, losses, during, the, p, tr, extinction, evidence, of, this, was, found, in, samples, from, south, china, sections, at, the, p, tr, boundary, here, 286, out, of, 329, marine, invertebrate, genera, disappear, within, the, final, two, sedimentary, zones, containing, conodonts, from, the, permian, the, decrease, in, diversity, was, probably, caused, by, a, sharp, increase, in, extinctions, rather, than, a, decrease, in, speciation, the, extinction, primarily, affected, organisms, with, calcium, carbonate, skeletons, especially, those, reliant, on, stable, co, 2, levels, to, produce, their, skeletons, these, organisms, were, susceptible, to, the, effects, of, the, ocean, acidification, that, resulted, from, increased, atmospheric, co, 2, organisms, that, relied, on, haemocyanin, or, haemoglobin, for, transporting, oxygen, were, more, resistant, to, extinction, than, those, utilising, haemerythrin, or, oxygen, diffusion, there, is, also, evidence, that, endemism, was, a, strong, risk, factor, influencing, a, taxon, s, likelihood, of, extinction, bivalve, taxa, that, were, endemic, and, localised, to, a, specific, region, were, more, likely, to, go, extinct, than, cosmopolitan, taxa, there, was, little, latitudinal, difference, in, the, survival, rates, of, taxa, among, benthic, organisms, the, extinction, event, multiplied, background, extinction, rates, and, therefore, caused, maximum, species, loss, to, taxa, that, had, a, high, background, extinction, rate, by, implication, taxa, with, a, high, turnover, the, extinction, rate, of, marine, organisms, was, catastrophic, bioturbators, were, extremely, severely, affected, as, evidenced, by, the, loss, of, the, sedimentary, mixed, layer, in, many, marine, facies, during, the, end, permian, extinction, surviving, marine, invertebrate, groups, included, articulate, brachiopods, those, with, a, hinge, which, had, undergone, a, slow, decline, in, numbers, since, the, p, tr, extinction, the, ceratitida, order, of, ammonites, and, crinoids, sea, lilies, which, very, nearly, became, extinct, but, later, became, abundant, and, diverse, the, groups, with, the, highest, survival, rates, generally, had, active, control, of, circulation, elaborate, gas, exchange, mechanisms, and, light, calcification, more, heavily, calcified, organisms, with, simpler, breathing, apparatuses, suffered, the, greatest, loss, of, species, diversity, in, the, case, of, the, brachiopods, at, least, surviving, taxa, were, generally, small, rare, members, of, a, formerly, diverse, community, conodonts, were, severely, affected, both, in, terms, of, taxonomic, and, morphological, diversity, although, not, as, severely, as, during, the, capitanian, mass, extinction, the, ammonoids, which, had, been, in, a, long, term, decline, for, the, 30, million, years, since, the, roadian, middle, permian, suffered, a, selective, extinction, pulse, 10, million, years, before, the, main, event, at, the, end, of, the, capitanian, stage, in, this, preliminary, extinction, which, greatly, reduced, disparity, or, the, range, of, different, ecological, guilds, environmental, factors, were, apparently, responsible, diversity, and, disparity, fell, further, until, the, p, tr, boundary, the, extinction, here, p, tr, was, non, selective, consistent, with, a, catastrophic, initiator, during, the, triassic, diversity, rose, rapidly, but, disparity, remained, low, the, range, of, morphospace, occupied, by, the, ammonoids, that, is, their, range, of, possible, forms, shapes, or, structures, became, more, restricted, as, the, permian, progressed, a, few, million, years, into, the, triassic, the, original, range, of, ammonoid, structures, was, once, again, reoccupied, but, the, parameters, were, now, shared, differently, among, clades, ostracods, experienced, prolonged, diversity, perturbations, during, the, changhsingian, before, the, ptme, proper, when, immense, proportions, of, them, abruptly, vanished, at, least, 74, of, ostracods, died, out, during, the, ptme, itself, bryozoans, had, been, on, a, long, term, decline, throughout, the, late, permian, epoch, before, they, suffered, even, more, catastrophic, losses, during, the, ptme, deep, water, sponges, suffered, a, significant, diversity, loss, and, exhibited, a, decrease, in, spicule, size, over, the, course, of, the, ptme, shallow, water, sponges, were, affected, much, less, strongly, they, experienced, an, increase, in, spicule, size, and, much, lower, loss, of, morphological, diversity, compared, to, their, deep, water, counterparts, foraminifera, suffered, a, severe, bottleneck, in, diversity, approximately, 93, of, latest, permian, foraminifera, became, extinct, with, 50, of, the, clade, textulariina, 92, of, lagenida, 96, of, fusulinida, and, 100, of, miliolida, disappearing, the, reason, why, lagenides, survived, while, fusulinoidean, fusulinides, went, completely, extinct, may, have, been, due, to, the, greater, range, of, environmental, tolerance, and, greater, geographic, distribution, of, the, former, compared, to, the, latter, cladodontomorph, sharks, likely, survived, the, extinction, because, of, their, ability, to, survive, in, refugia, in, the, deep, oceans, this, hypothesis, is, based, on, the, discovery, of, early, cretaceous, cladodontomorphs, in, deep, outer, shelf, environments, ichthyosaurs, which, are, believed, to, have, evolved, immediately, before, the, ptme, were, also, ptme, survivors, the, lilliput, effect, the, phenomenon, of, dwarfing, of, species, during, and, immediately, following, a, mass, extinction, event, has, been, observed, across, the, permian, triassic, boundary, notably, occurring, in, foraminifera, brachiopods, bivalves, and, ostracods, though, gastropods, that, survived, the, cataclysm, were, smaller, in, size, than, those, that, did, not, it, remains, debated, whether, the, lilliput, effect, truly, took, hold, among, gastropods, some, gastropod, taxa, termed, gulliver, gastropods, ballooned, in, size, during, and, immediately, following, the, mass, extinction, exemplifying, the, lilliput, effect, s, opposite, which, has, been, dubbed, the, brobdingnag, effect, the, permian, had, great, diversity, in, insect, and, other, invertebrate, species, including, the, largest, insects, ever, to, have, existed, the, end, permian, is, the, largest, known, mass, extinction, of, insects, according, to, some, sources, it, may, well, be, the, only, mass, extinction, to, significantly, affect, insect, diversity, eight, or, nine, insect, orders, became, extinct, and, ten, more, were, greatly, reduced, in, diversity, palaeodictyopteroids, insects, with, piercing, and, sucking, mouthparts, began, to, decline, during, the, mid, permian, these, extinctions, have, been, linked, to, a, change, in, flora, the, greatest, decline, occurred, in, the, late, permian, and, was, probably, not, directly, caused, by, weather, related, floral, transitions, however, some, observed, entomofaunal, declines, in, the, ptme, were, biogeographic, changes, rather, than, outright, extinctions, the, geological, record, of, terrestrial, plants, is, sparse, and, based, mostly, on, pollen, and, spore, studies, floral, changes, across, the, permian, triassic, boundary, are, highly, variable, depending, on, the, location, and, preservation, quality, of, any, given, site, plants, are, relatively, immune, to, mass, extinction, with, the, impact, of, all, the, major, mass, extinctions, insignificant, at, a, family, level, even, the, reduction, observed, in, species, diversity, of, 50, may, be, mostly, due, to, taphonomic, processes, however, a, massive, rearrangement, of, ecosystems, does, occur, with, plant, abundances, and, distributions, changing, profoundly, and, all, the, forests, virtually, disappearing, the, dominant, floral, groups, changed, with, many, groups, of, land, plants, entering, abrupt, decline, such, as, cordaites, gymnosperms, and, glossopteris, seed, ferns, the, severity, of, plant, extinction, has, been, disputed, the, glossopteris, dominated, flora, that, characterised, high, latitude, gondwana, collapsed, in, australia, around, 370, 000, years, before, the, permian, triassic, boundary, with, this, flora, s, collapse, being, less, constrained, in, western, gondwana, but, still, likely, occurring, a, few, hundred, thousand, years, before, the, boundary, palynological, or, pollen, studies, from, east, greenland, of, sedimentary, rock, strata, laid, down, during, the, extinction, period, indicate, dense, gymnosperm, woodlands, before, the, event, at, the, same, time, that, marine, invertebrate, macrofauna, declined, these, large, woodlands, died, out, and, were, followed, by, a, rise, in, diversity, of, smaller, herbaceous, plants, including, lycopodiophyta, both, selaginellales, and, isoetales, data, from, kap, stosch, suggest, that, floral, species, richness, was, not, significantly, affected, during, the, ptme, the, cordaites, flora, which, dominated, the, angaran, floristic, realm, corresponding, to, siberia, collapsed, over, the, course, of, the, extinction, in, the, kuznetsk, basin, the, aridity, induced, extinction, of, the, regions, s, humid, adapted, forest, flora, dominated, by, cordaitaleans, occurred, approximately, 252, 76, ma, around, 820, 000, years, before, the, end, permian, extinction, in, south, china, suggesting, that, the, end, permian, biotic, catastrophe, may, have, started, earlier, on, land, and, that, the, ecological, crisis, may, have, been, more, gradual, and, asynchronous, on, land, compared, to, its, more, abrupt, onset, in, the, marine, realm, in, north, china, the, transition, between, the, upper, shihhotse, and, sunjiagou, formations, and, their, lateral, equivalents, marked, a, very, large, extinction, of, plants, in, the, region, those, plant, genera, that, did, not, go, extinct, still, experienced, a, great, reduction, in, their, geographic, range, following, this, transition, coal, swamps, vanished, the, north, chinese, floral, extinction, correlates, with, the, decline, of, the, gigantopteris, flora, of, south, china, in, south, china, the, subtropical, cathaysian, gigantopterid, dominated, rainforests, abruptly, collapsed, the, floral, extinction, in, south, china, is, associated, with, bacterial, blooms, in, soil, and, nearby, lacustrine, ecosystems, with, soil, erosion, resulting, from, the, die, off, of, plants, being, their, likely, cause, wildfires, too, likely, played, a, role, in, the, fall, of, gigantopteris, a, conifer, flora, in, what, is, now, jordan, known, from, fossils, near, the, dead, sea, showed, unusual, stability, over, the, permian, triassic, transition, and, appears, to, have, been, only, minimally, affected, by, the, crisis, the, terrestrial, vertebrate, extinction, occurred, rapidly, taking, 50, 000, years, or, less, a, study, of, coprolites, in, the, vyazniki, fossil, beds, in, russia, suggests, it, took, only, a, few, thousand, years, aridification, induced, by, global, warming, was, the, chief, culprit, behind, terrestrial, vertebrate, extinctions, there, is, enough, evidence, to, indicate, that, over, two, thirds, of, terrestrial, labyrinthodont, amphibians, sauropsid, reptile, and, therapsid, proto, mammal, taxa, became, extinct, large, herbivores, suffered, the, heaviest, losses, all, permian, anapsid, reptiles, died, out, except, the, procolophonids, although, testudines, have, morphologically, anapsid, skulls, they, are, now, thought, to, have, separately, evolved, from, diapsid, ancestors, pelycosaurs, died, out, before, the, end, of, the, permian, too, few, permian, diapsid, fossils, have, been, found, to, support, any, conclusion, about, the, effect, of, the, permian, extinction, on, diapsids, the, reptile, group, from, which, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, and, dinosaurs, including, birds, evolved, gorgonopsians, are, traditionally, thought, to, have, gone, extinct, during, the, ptme, but, some, tentative, evidence, suggests, they, may, have, survived, into, the, triassic, the, groups, that, survived, suffered, extremely, heavy, losses, of, species, and, some, terrestrial, vertebrate, groups, very, nearly, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, permian, some, of, the, surviving, groups, did, not, persist, for, long, past, this, period, but, others, that, barely, survived, went, on, to, produce, diverse, and, long, lasting, lineages, however, it, took, 30, million, years, for, the, terrestrial, vertebrate, fauna, to, fully, recover, both, numerically, and, ecologically, it, is, difficult, to, analyze, extinction, and, survival, rates, of, land, organisms, in, detail, because, few, terrestrial, fossil, beds, span, the, permian, triassic, boundary, the, best, known, record, of, vertebrate, changes, across, the, permian, triassic, boundary, occurs, in, the, karoo, supergroup, of, south, africa, but, statistical, analyses, have, so, far, not, produced, clear, conclusions, one, study, of, the, karoo, basin, found, that, 69, of, terrestrial, vertebrates, went, extinct, over, 300, 000, years, leading, up, to, the, permian, triassic, boundary, followed, by, a, minor, extinction, pulse, involving, four, taxa, that, survived, the, previous, extinction, interval, another, study, of, latest, permian, vertebrates, in, the, karoo, basin, found, that, 54, of, them, went, extinct, due, to, the, ptme, in, the, wake, of, the, extinction, event, the, ecological, structure, of, present, day, biosphere, evolved, from, the, stock, of, surviving, taxa, in, the, sea, the, palaeozoic, evolutionary, fauna, declined, while, the, modern, evolutionary, fauna, achieved, greater, dominance, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, marked, a, key, turning, point, in, this, ecological, shift, that, began, after, the, capitanian, mass, extinction, and, culminated, in, the, late, jurassic, typical, taxa, of, shelly, benthic, faunas, were, now, bivalves, snails, sea, urchins, and, malacostraca, whereas, bony, fishes, and, marine, reptiles, diversified, in, the, pelagic, zone, on, land, dinosaurs, and, mammals, arose, in, the, course, of, the, triassic, the, profound, change, in, the, taxonomic, composition, was, partly, a, result, of, the, selectivity, of, the, extinction, event, which, affected, some, taxa, e, g, brachiopods, more, severely, than, others, e, g, bivalves, however, recovery, was, also, differential, between, taxa, some, survivors, became, extinct, some, million, years, after, the, extinction, event, without, having, rediversified, dead, clade, walking, e, g, the, snail, family, bellerophontidae, whereas, others, rose, to, dominance, over, geologic, times, e, g, bivalves, a, cosmopolitanism, event, began, immediately, after, the, end, permian, extinction, event, marine, post, extinction, faunas, were, mostly, species, poor, and, were, dominated, by, few, disaster, taxa, such, as, the, bivalves, claraia, unionites, eumorphotis, and, promyalina, the, conodonts, clarkina, and, hindeodus, the, inarticulate, brachiopod, lingularia, and, the, foraminifera, earlandia, and, rectocornuspira, kalhori, the, latter, of, which, is, sometimes, classified, under, the, genus, ammodiscus, their, guild, diversity, was, also, low, post, ptme, faunas, had, a, flat, insignificant, latitudinal, diversity, gradient, the, speed, of, recovery, from, the, extinction, is, disputed, some, scientists, estimate, that, it, took, 10, million, years, until, the, middle, triassic, due, to, the, severity, of, the, extinction, however, studies, in, bear, lake, county, near, paris, idaho, and, nearby, sites, in, idaho, and, nevada, showed, a, relatively, quick, rebound, in, a, localized, early, triassic, marine, ecosystem, paris, biota, taking, around, 1, 3, million, years, to, recover, while, an, unusually, diverse, and, complex, ichnobiota, is, known, from, italy, less, than, a, million, years, after, the, end, permian, extinction, additionally, the, complex, guiyang, biota, found, near, guiyang, china, also, indicates, life, thrived, in, some, places, just, a, million, years, after, the, mass, extinction, as, does, a, fossil, assemblage, known, as, the, shanggan, fauna, found, in, shanggan, china, the, wangmo, biota, from, the, luolou, formation, of, guizhou, and, a, gastropod, fauna, from, the, al, jil, formation, of, oman, regional, differences, in, the, pace, of, biotic, recovery, existed, which, suggests, that, the, impact, of, the, extinction, may, have, been, felt, less, severely, in, some, areas, than, others, with, differential, environmental, stress, and, instability, being, the, source, of, the, variance, in, addition, it, has, been, proposed, that, although, overall, taxonomic, diversity, rebounded, rapidly, functional, ecological, diversity, took, much, longer, to, return, to, its, pre, extinction, levels, one, study, concluded, that, marine, ecological, recovery, was, still, ongoing, 50, million, years, after, the, extinction, during, the, latest, triassic, even, though, taxonomic, diversity, had, rebounded, in, a, tenth, of, that, time, the, pace, and, timing, of, recovery, also, differed, based, on, clade, and, mode, of, life, seafloor, communities, maintained, a, comparatively, low, diversity, until, the, end, of, the, early, triassic, approximately, 4, million, years, after, the, extinction, event, epifaunal, benthos, took, longer, to, recover, than, infaunal, benthos, this, slow, recovery, stands, in, remarkable, contrast, with, the, quick, recovery, seen, in, nektonic, organisms, such, as, ammonoids, which, exceeded, pre, extinction, diversities, already, two, million, years, after, the, crisis, and, conodonts, which, diversified, considerably, over, the, first, two, million, years, of, the, early, triassic, recent, work, suggests, that, the, pace, of, recovery, was, intrinsically, driven, by, the, intensity, of, competition, among, species, which, drives, rates, of, niche, differentiation, and, speciation, that, recovery, was, slow, in, the, early, triassic, can, be, explained, by, low, levels, of, biological, competition, due, to, the, paucity, of, taxonomic, diversity, and, that, biotic, recovery, explosively, accelerated, in, the, anisian, can, be, explained, by, niche, crowding, a, phenomenon, that, would, have, drastically, increased, competition, becoming, prevalent, by, the, anisian, biodiversity, rise, thus, behaved, as, a, positive, feedback, loop, enhancing, itself, as, it, took, off, in, the, spathian, and, anisian, accordingly, low, levels, of, interspecific, competition, in, seafloor, communities, that, are, dominated, by, primary, consumers, correspond, to, slow, rates, of, diversification, and, high, levels, of, interspecific, competition, among, nektonic, secondary, and, tertiary, consumers, to, high, diversification, rates, other, explanations, state, that, life, was, delayed, in, its, recovery, because, grim, conditions, returned, periodically, over, the, course, of, the, early, triassic, causing, further, extinction, events, such, as, the, smithian, spathian, boundary, extinction, continual, episodes, of, extremely, hot, climatic, conditions, during, the, early, triassic, have, been, held, responsible, for, the, delayed, recovery, of, oceanic, life, in, particular, skeletonised, taxa, that, are, most, vulnerable, to, high, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, the, relative, delay, in, the, recovery, of, benthic, organisms, has, been, attributed, to, widespread, anoxia, but, high, abundances, of, benthic, species, contradict, this, explanation, a, 2019, study, attributed, the, dissimilarity, of, recovery, times, between, different, ecological, communities, to, differences, in, local, environmental, stress, during, the, biotic, recovery, interval, with, regions, experiencing, persistent, environmental, stress, post, extinction, recovering, more, slowly, supporting, the, view, that, recurrent, environmental, calamities, were, culpable, for, retarded, biotic, recovery, recurrent, early, triassic, environmental, stresses, also, acted, as, a, ceiling, limiting, the, maximum, ecological, complexity, of, marine, ecosystems, until, the, spathian, recovery, biotas, appear, to, have, been, ecologically, uneven, and, unstable, into, the, anisian, making, them, vulnerable, to, environmental, stresses, whereas, most, marine, communities, were, fully, recovered, by, the, middle, triassic, global, marine, diversity, reached, pre, extinction, values, no, earlier, than, the, middle, jurassic, approximately, 75, million, years, after, the, extinction, event, prior, to, the, extinction, about, two, thirds, of, marine, animals, were, sessile, and, attached, to, the, seafloor, during, the, mesozoic, only, about, half, of, the, marine, animals, were, sessile, while, the, rest, were, free, living, analysis, of, marine, fossils, from, the, period, indicated, a, decrease, in, the, abundance, of, sessile, epifaunal, suspension, feeders, such, as, brachiopods, and, sea, lilies, and, an, increase, in, more, complex, mobile, species, such, as, snails, sea, urchins, and, crabs, before, the, permian, mass, extinction, event, both, complex, and, simple, marine, ecosystems, were, equally, common, after, the, recovery, from, the, mass, extinction, the, complex, communities, outnumbered, the, simple, communities, by, nearly, three, to, one, and, the, increase, in, predation, pressure, and, durophagy, led, to, the, mesozoic, marine, revolution, marine, vertebrates, recovered, relatively, quickly, with, complex, predator, prey, interactions, with, vertebrates, at, the, top, of, the, food, web, being, known, from, coprolites, five, million,

bivalves, rapidly, recolonised, many, marine, environments, in, the, wake, of, the, catastrophe, bivalves, were, fairly, rare, before, the, p, tr, extinction, but, became, numerous, and, diverse, in, the, triassic, taking, over, niches, that, were, filled, primarily, by, brachiopods, before, the, mass, extinction, event, bivalves, were, once, thought, to, have, outcompeted, brachiopods, but, this, outdated, hypothesis, about, the, brachiopod, bivalve, transition, has, been, disproven, by, bayesian, analysis, the, success, of, bivalves, in, the, aftermath, of, the, extinction, event, may, have, been, a, function, of, them, possessing, greater, resilience, to, environmental, stress, compared, to, the, brachiopods, that, they, coexisted, with, whilst, other, studies, have, emphasised, the, greater, niche, breadth, of, the, former, the, rise, of, bivalves, to, taxonomic, and, ecological, dominance, over, brachiopods, was, not, synchronous, however, and, brachiopods, retained, an, outsized, ecological, dominance, into, the, middle, triassic, even, as, bivalves, eclipsed, them, in, taxonomic, diversity, some, researchers, think, the, brachiopod, bivalve, transition, was, attributable, not, only, to, the, end, permian, extinction, but, also, the, ecological, restructuring, that, began, as, a, result, of, the, capitanian, extinction, infaunal, habits, in, bivalves, became, more, common, after, the, ptme, linguliform, brachiopods, were, commonplace, immediately, after, the, extinction, event, their, abundance, having, been, essentially, unaffected, by, the, crisis, adaptations, for, oxygen, poor, and, warm, environments, such, as, increased, lophophoral, cavity, surface, shell, width, length, ratio, and, shell, miniaturisation, are, observed, in, post, extinction, linguliforms, the, surviving, brachiopod, fauna, was, very, low, in, diversity, and, exhibited, no, provincialism, whatsoever, brachiopods, began, their, recovery, around, 250, 1, 0, 3,

with, microbialites, were, disproportionately, represented, among, ostracod, survivors, ostracod, recovery, began, in, the, spathian, despite, high, taxonomic, turnover, the, ecological, life, modes, of, early, triassic, ostracods, remained, rather, similar, to, those, of, pre, ptme, ostracods, bryozoans, in, the, early, triassic, were, not, diverse, represented, mainly, by, members, of, trepostomatida, during, the, middle, triassic, there, was, a, rise, in, bryozoan, diversity, which, peaked, in, the, carnian, crinoids, sea, lilies, suffered, a, selective, extinction, resulting, in, a, decrease, in, the, variety, of, their, forms, though, cladistic, analyses, suggest, the, beginning, of, their, recovery, to, have, taken, place, in, the, induan, the, recovery, of, their, diversity, as, measured, by, fossil, evidence, was, far, less, brisk, showing, up, in, the, late, ladinian, their, adaptive, radiation, after, the, extinction, event, resulted, in, forms, possessing, flexible, arms, becoming, widespread, motility, predominantly, a, response, to, predation, pressure, also, became, far, more, prevalent, though, their, taxonomic, diversity, remained, relatively, low, crinoids, regained, much, of, their, ecological, dominance, by, the, middle, triassic, epoch, stem, group, echinoids, survived, the, ptme, the, survival, of, miocidarid, echinoids, such, as, eotiaris, is, likely, attributable, to, their, ability, to, thrive, in, a, wide, range, of, environmental, conditions, conodonts, saw, a, rapid, recovery, during, the, induan, with, anchignathodontids, experiencing, a, diversity, peak, in, the, earliest, induan, gondolellids, diversified, at, the, end, of, the, griesbachian, this, diversity, spike, was, most, responsible, for, the, overall, conodont, diversity, peak, in, the, smithian, segminiplanate, conodonts, again, experienced, a, brief, period, of, domination, in, the, early, spathian, probably, related, to, a, transient,

of, their, vacant, niches, the, recovery, of, benthic, foraminifera, was, very, slow, and, frequently, interrupted, until, the, spathian, microbial, reefs, were, common, across, shallow, seas, for, a, short, time, during, the, earliest, triassic, predominating, in, low, latitudes, while, being, rarer, in, higher, latitudes, occurring, both, in, anoxic, and, oxic, waters, polybessurus, like, microfossils, often, dominated, these, earliest, triassic, microbialites, microbial, metazoan, reefs, appeared, very, early, in, the, early, triassic, and, they, dominated, many, surviving, communities, across, the, recovery, from, the, mass, extinction, microbialite, deposits, appear, to, have, declined, in, the, early, griesbachian, synchronously, with, a, significant, sea, level, drop, that, occurred, then, metazoan, built, reefs, reemerged, during, the, olenekian, mainly, being, composed, of, sponge, biostrome, and, bivalve, builups, keratose, sponges, were, particularly, noteworthy, in, their, integral, importance, to, early, triassic, microbial, metazoan, reef, communities, and, they, helped, to, create, stability, in, heavily, damaged, ecosystems, during, early, phases, of, biotic, recovery, tubiphytes, dominated, reefs, appeared, at, the, end, of, the, olenekian, representing, the, earliest, platform, margin, reefs, of, the, triassic, though, they, did, not, become, abundant, until, the, late, anisian, when, reefs, species, richness, increased, the, first, scleractinian, corals, appear, in, the, late, anisian, as, well, although, they, would, not, become, the, dominant, reef, builders, until, the, end, of, the, triassic, period, bryozoans, after, sponges, were, the, most, numerous, organisms, in, tethyan, reefs, during, the, anisian, metazoan, reefs, became, common, again, during, the, anisian, because, the, oceans, cooled, down, then, from, their, overheated, state, during, the, early, triassic, biodiversity, amongst, metazoan, reefs, did, not, recover, until, well, into, the, anisian, millions, of, years, after, non, reef, ecosystems, recovered, their, diversity, microbially, induced, sedimentary, structures, miss, from, the, earliest, triassic, have, been, found, to, be, associated, with, abundant, opportunistic, bivalves, and, vertical, burrows, and, it, is, likely, that, post, extinction, microbial, mats, played, a, vital, indispensable, role, in, the, survival, and, recovery, of, various, bioturbating, organisms, the, microbialite, refuge, hypothesis, has, been, criticised, as, reflecting, a, taphonomic, bias, due, to, the, greater, preservation, potential, of, microbialite, deposits, however, rather, than, a, genuine, phenomenon, ichnocoenoses, show, that, marine, ecosystems, recovered, to, pre, extinction, levels, of, ecological, complexity, by, the, late, olenekian, anisian, ichnocoenoses, show, slightly, lower, diversity, than, spathian, ichnocoenoses, although, this, was, likely, a, taphonomic, consequence, of, increased, and, deeper, bioturbation, erasing, evidence, of, shallower, bioturbation, ichnological, evidence, suggests, that, recovery, and, recolonisation, of, marine, environments, may, have, taken, place, by, way, of, outward, dispersal, from, refugia, that, suffered, relatively, mild, perturbations, and, whose, local, biotas, were, less, strongly, affected, by, the, mass, extinction, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, world, s, oceans, although, complex, bioturbation, patterns, were, rare, in, the, early, triassic, likely, reflecting, the, inhospitability, of, many, shallow, water,

dominant, gymnosperm, genera, were, replaced, by, lycophytes, extant, lycophytes, are, recolonizers, of, disturbed, areas, during, an, extinction, pulse, at, the, griesbachian, dienerian, boundary, the, particular, post, extinction, dominance, of, lycophytes, which, were, well, adapted, for, coastal, environments, can, be, explained, in, part, by, global, marine, transgressions, during, the, early, triassic, the, worldwide, recovery, of, gymnosperm, forests, took, approximately, 4, 5, million, years, however, this, trend, of, prolonged, lycophyte, dominance, during, the, early, triassic, was, not, universal, as, evidenced, by, the, much, more, rapid, recovery, of, gymnosperms, in, certain, regions, and, floral, recovery, likely, did, not, follow, a, congruent, globally, universal, trend, but, instead, varied, by, region, according, to, local, environmental, conditions, in, east, greenland, lycophytes, replaced, gymnosperms, as, the, dominant, plants, later, other, groups, of, gymnosperms, again, become, dominant, but, again, suffered, major, die, offs, these, cyclical, flora, shifts, occurred, a, few, times, over, the, course, of, the, extinction, period, and, afterward, these, fluctuations, of, the, dominant, flora, between, woody, and, herbaceous, taxa, indicate, chronic, environmental, stress, resulting, in, a, loss, of, most, large, woodland, plant, species, the, successions, and, extinctions, of, plant, communities, do, not, coincide, with, the, shift, in, 13, c, values, but, occurred, many, years, after, in, what, is, now, the, barents, sea, of, the, coast, of, norway, the, post, extinction, fauna, is, dominated, by, pteridophytes, and, lycopods, which, were, suited, for, primary, succession, and, recolonisation, of, devastated, areas, although, gymnosperms, made, a, rapid, recovery, with, the, lycopod, dominated, flora, not, persisting, across, most, of, the, early, triassic, as, postulated, in, other, regions, in, europe, and, north, china, the, interval, of, recovery, was, dominated, by, the, lycopsid, pleuromeia, an, opportunistic, pioneer, plant, that, filled, ecological, vacancies, until, other, plants, were, able, to, expand, out, of, refugia, and, recolonise, the, land, conifers, became, common, by, the, early, anisian, while, pteridosperms, and, cycadophytes, only, fully, recovered, by, the, late, anisian, during, the,

china, s, flora, in, tibet, the, early, dienerian, endosporites, papillatus, pinuspollenites, thoracatus, assemblages, closely, resemble, late, changhsingian, tibetan, floras, suggesting, that, the, widespread, dominant, latest, permian, flora, resurged, easily, after, the, ptme, however, in, the, late, dienerian, a, major, shift, towards, assemblages, dominated, by, cavate, trilete, spores, took, place, heralding, widespread, deforestation, and, a, rapid, change, to, hotter, more, humid, conditions, quillworts, and, spike, mosses, dominated, tibetan, flora, for, about, a, million, years, after, this, shift, in, pakistan, then, the, northern, margin, of, gondwana, the, flora, was, rich, in, lycopods, associated, with, conifers, and, pteridosperms, floral, turnovers, continued, to, occur, due, to, repeated, perturbations, arising, from, recurrent, volcanic, activity, until, terrestrial, ecosystems, stabilised, around, 2, 1, myr, after, the, ptme, in, southwestern, gondwana, the, post, extinction, flora, was, dominated, by, bennettitaleans, and, cycads, with, members, of, peltaspermales, ginkgoales, and, umkomasiales, being, less, common, constituents, of, this, flora, around, the, induan, olenekian, boundary, as, palaeocommunities, recovered, a, new, dicroidium, flora, was, established, in, which, umkomasiales, continued, to, be, prominent, and, in, which, equisetales, and, cycadales, were, subordinate, forms, the, dicroidium, flora, further, diversified, in, the, anisian, to, its, peak, wherein, umkomasiales, and, ginkgoales, constituted, most, of, the, tree, canopy, and, peltaspermales, petriellales, cycadales, umkomasiales, gnetales, equisetales, and, dipteridaceae, dominated, the, understory, no, coal, deposits, are, known, from, the, early, triassic, and, those, in, the, middle, triassic, are, thin, and, low, grade, this, coal, gap, has, been, explained, in, many, ways, it, has, been, suggested, that, new, more, aggressive, fungi, insects, and, vertebrates, evolved, and, killed, vast, numbers, of, trees, these, decomposers, themselves, suffered, heavy, losses, of, species, during, the, extinction, and, are, not, considered, a, likely, cause, of, the, coal, gap, it, could, simply, be, that, all, coal, forming, plants, were, rendered, extinct, by, the, p, tr, extinction, and, that, it, took, 10, million, years, for, a, new, suite, of, plants, to, adapt, to, the, moist, acid, conditions, of, peat, bogs, abiotic, factors, factors, not, caused, by, organisms, such, as, decreased, rainfall, or, increased, input, of, clastic, sediments, may, also, be, to, blame, on, the, other, hand, the, lack, of, coal, may, simply, reflect, the, scarcity, of, all, known, sediments, from, the, early, triassic, coal, producing, ecosystems, rather, than, disappearing, may, have, moved, to, areas, where, we, have, no, sedimentary, record, for, the, early, triassic, for, example, in, eastern, australia, a, cold, climate, had, been, the, norm, for, a, long, period, with, a, peat, mire, ecosystem, adapted, to, these, conditions, approximately, 95, of, these, peat, producing, plants, went, locally, extinct, at, the, p, tr, boundary, coal, deposits, in, australia, and, antarctica, disappear, significantly, before, the, p, tr, boundary, land, vertebrates, took, an, unusually, long, time, to, recover, from, the, p, tr, extinction, palaeontologist, michael, benton, estimated, the, recovery, was, not, complete, until, 30, million, years, after, the, extinction, i, e, not, until, the, late, triassic, when, the, first, dinosaurs, had, risen, from, bipedal, archosaurian, ancestors, and, the, first, mammals, from, small, cynodont, ancestors, a, tetrapod, gap, may, have, existed, from, the, induan, until, the, early, spathian,

recent, evidence, has, called, into, question, its, status, as, a, post, ptme, disaster, taxon, the, evolutionary, success, of, lystrosaurus, in, the, aftermath, of, the, ptme, is, believed, to, be, attributable, to, the, dicynodont, taxon, s, grouping, behaviour, and, tolerance, for, extreme, and, highly, variable, climatic, conditions, other, likely, factors, behind, the, success, of, lystrosaurus, included, extremely, fast, growth, rate, exhibited, by, the, dicynodont, genus, along, with, its, early, onset, of, sexual, maturity, antarctica, may, have, served, as, a, refuge, for, dicynodonts, during, the, ptme, from, which, surviving, dicynodonts, spread, out, of, in, its, aftermath, ichnological, evidence, from, the, earliest, triassic, of, the, karoo, basin, shows, dicynodonts, were, abundant, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, biotic, crisis, smaller, carnivorous, cynodont, therapsids, also, survived, a, group, that, included, the, ancestors, of, mammals, as, with, dicynodonts, selective, pressures, favoured, endothermic, epicynodonts, therocephalians, likewise, survived, burrowing, may, have, been, a, key, adaptation, that, helped, them, make, it, through, the, ptme, in, the, karoo, region, of, southern, africa, the, therocephalians, tetracynodon, moschorhinus, and, ictidosuchoides, survived, but, do, not, appear, to, have, been, abundant, in, the, triassic, early, triassic, therocephalians, were, mostly, survivors, of, the, ptme, rather, than, newly, evolved, taxa, that, originated, during, the, evolutionary, radiation, in, its, aftermath, both, therocephalians, and, cynodonts, known, collectively, as, eutheriodonts, decreased, in, body, size, from, the, late, permian, to, the, early, triassic, this, decrease, in, body, size, has, been, interpreted, as, an, example, of, the, lilliput, effect, archosaurs, which, included, the, ancestors, of, dinosaurs, and, crocodilians, were, initially, rarer, than, therapsids, but, they, began, to, displace, therapsids, in, the, mid, triassic, olenekian, tooth, fossil, assemblages, from, the, karoo, basin, indicate, that, archosauromorphs, were, already, highly, diverse, by, this, point, in, time, though, not, very, ecologically, specialised, in, the, mid, to, late, triassic, the, dinosaurs, evolved, from, one, group, of, archosaurs, and, went, on, to, dominate, terrestrial, ecosystems, during, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, this, triassic, takeover, may, have, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, mammals, by, forcing, the, surviving, therapsids, and, their, mammaliform, successors, to, live, as, small, mainly, nocturnal, insectivores, nocturnal, life, probably, forced, at, least, the, mammaliforms, to, develop, fur, better, hearing, and, higher, metabolic, rates, while, losing, part, of, the, differential, color, sensitive, retinal, receptors, reptilians, and, birds, preserved, archosaurs, also, experienced, an, increase, in, metabolic, rates, over, time, during, the, early, triassic, the, archosaur, dominance, would, end, again, due, to, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, after, which, both, birds, only, extant, dinosaurs, and, mammals, only, extant, synapsids, would, diversify, and, share, the, world, temnospondyl, amphibians, made, a, quick, recovery, the, appearance, in, the, fossil, record, of, so, many, temnospondyl, clades, suggests, they, may, have, been, ideally, suited, as, pioneer, species, that, recolonised, decimated, ecosystems, during, the, induan, tupilakosaurids, in, particular, thrived, as, disaster, taxa, including, tupilakosaurus, itself, though, they, gave, way, to, other, temnospondyls, as, ecosystems, recovered, temnospondyls, were, reduced, in, size, during, the, induan, but, their, body, size, rebounded, to, pre, ptme, levels, during, the, olenekian, mastodonsaurus, and, trematosaurians, were, the, main, aquatic, and, semiaquatic, predators, during, most, of, the, triassic, some, preying, on, tetrapods, and, others, on, fish, most, fossil, insect, groups, found, after, the, permian, triassic, boundary, differ, significantly, from, those, before, of, paleozoic, insect, groups, only, the, glosselytrodea, miomoptera, and, protorthoptera, have, been, discovered, in, deposits, from, after, the, extinction, the, caloneurodeans, paleodictyopteroids, protelytropterans, and, protodonates, became, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, permian, though, triassic, insects, are, very, different, from, those, of, the, permian, a, gap, in, the, insect, fossil, record, spans, approximately, 15, million, years, from, the, late, permian, to, early, triassic, in, well, documented, late, triassic, deposits, fossils, overwhelmingly, consist, of, modern, fossil, insect, groups, microbially, induced, sedimentary, structures, miss, dominated, north, chinese, terrestrial, fossil, assemblages, in, the, early, triassic, in, arctic, canada, as, well, miss, became, a, common, occurrence, following, the, permian, triassic, extinction, the, prevalence, of, miss, in, many, early, triassic, rocks, shows, that, microbial, mats, were, an, important, feature, of, post, extinction, ecosystems, that, were, denuded, of, bioturbators, that, would, have, otherwise, prevented, their, widespread, occurrence, the, disappearance, of, miss, later, in, the, early, triassic, likely, indicated, a, greater, recovery, of, terrestrial, ecosystems, and, specifically, a, return, of, prevalent, bioturbation, explaining, an, event, from, 250, million, years, ago, is, inherently, difficult, with, much, of, the, evidence, on, land, eroded, or, deeply, buried, while, the, spreading, seafloor, is, completely, recycled, over, 200, million, years, leaving, no, useful, indications, beneath, the, ocean, yet, scientists, have, gathered, significant, evidence, for, causes, and, several, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, the, proposals, include, both, catastrophic, and, gradual, processes, similar, to, those, theorized, for, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, but, with, much, less, current, consensus, any, hypothesis, about, the, cause, must, explain, the, selectivity, of, the, event, which, affected, organisms, with, calcium, carbonate, skeletons, most, severely, the, long, period, 4, to, 6, million, years, before, recovery, started, and, the, minimal, extent, of, biological, mineralization, despite, inorganic, carbonates, being, deposited, once, the, recovery, began, the, flood, basalt, eruptions, that, produced, the, large, igneous, province, of, the, siberian, traps, were, among, the, largest, known, volcanic, events, extruding, lava, over, 2, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 770, 000, sq, mi, roughly, the, size, of, saudi, arabia, producing, a, catastrophic, impact, the, date, of, the, siberian, traps, eruptions, matches, well, with, the, extinction, event, a, study, of, the, norilsk, and, maymecha, kotuy, regions, of, the, northern, siberian, platform, indicates, that, volcanic, activity, occurred, during, a, few, enormous, pulses, of, magma, as, opposed, to, more, regular, flows, the, siberian, traps, caused, one, of, the, most, rapid, rises, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, levels, in, the, geologic, record, with, the, rate, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, estimated, as, five, times, faster, than, during, the, preceding, catastrophic, capitanian, mass, extinction, during, the, eruption, of, the, emeishan, traps, overwhelming, inorganic, carbon, sinks, carbon, dioxide, levels, might, have, jumped, from, between, 500, and, 4, 000, ppm, prior, to, the, extinction, to, around, 8, 000, ppm, after, according, to, one, estimate, another, study, estimated, pre, extinction, carbon, dioxide, levels, at, 400, ppm, which, then, rose, to, 2, 500, ppm, with, 3, 900, to, 12, 000, gigatonnes, of, carbon, added, to, the, ocean, atmosphere, system, extreme, temperature, rise, would, have, followed, though, some, evidence, suggests, a, lag, of, 12, 000, to, 128, 000, years, between, the, rise, in, volcanic, carbon, dioxide, emissions, and, global, warming, during, the, latest, permian, before, the, extinction, global, average, surface, temperatures, were, about, 18, 2, c, which, shot, up, to, as, much, as, 35, c, this, hyperthermal, condition, lasting, as, long, as, 500, 000, years, air, temperatures, at, gondwana,

extremely, high, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, persisted, over, a, long, period, the, position, and, alignment, of, pangaea, at, the, time, made, the, inorganic, carbon, cycle, very, inefficient, at, burying, carbon, in, a, 2020, paper, scientists, reconstructed, the, mechanisms, that, led, to, the, extinction, event, in, a, biogeochemical, model, showed, the, consequences, of, the, greenhouse, effect, on, the, marine, environment, and, concluded, that, the, mass, extinction, can, be, traced, back, to, volcanic, co, 2, emissions, evidence, also, points, to, volcanic, combustion, of, underground, fossil, fuel, deposits, based, on, paired, coronene, mercury, spikes, coinciding, with, geographically, widespread, mercury, anomalies, and, the, rise, in, isotopically, light, carbon, te, th, values, increase, twentyfold, over, the, ptme, further, indicating, it, was, concomitant, with, extreme, volcanism, a, major, volcanogenic, influx, of, isotopically, light, zinc, from, the, siberian, traps, has, also, been, recorded, further, confirming, that, volcanism, was, contemporary, with, the, ptme, the, siberian, traps, eruptions, had, unusual, features, that, made, them, even, more, dangerous, the, siberian, lithosphere, is, rich, in, halogens, extremely, destructive, to, the, ozone, layer, and, evidence, from, subcontinental, lithospheric, xenoliths, indicates, that, as, much, as, 70, of, their, halogen, content, was, released, into, the, atmosphere, around, 18, teratonnes, of, hydrochloric, acid, were, emitted, along, with, sulphur, rich, volatiles, that, caused, dust, clouds, and, acid, aerosols, which, would, have, blocked, out, sunlight, and, disrupted, photosynthesis, on, land, and, in, the, photic, zone, of, the, ocean, causing, food, chains, to, collapse, these, volcanic, outbursts, of, sulphur, also, induced, brief, but, severe, global, cooling, punctuating, the, broader, trend, of, rapid, global, warming, with, glacio, eustatic, sea, level, fall, however, the, briefness, of, these, cold, events, makes, them, unlikely, to, have, been, a, significant, kill, mechanism, the, eruptions, may, also, have, caused, acid, rain, as, the, aerosols, washed, out, of, the, atmosphere, that, may, have, killed, land, plants, and, mollusks, and, planktonic, organisms, with, calcium, carbonate, shells, pure, flood, basalts, produce, fluid, low, viscosity, lava, and, do, not, hurl, debris, into, the, atmosphere, it, appears, however, that, 20, of, the, output, of, the, siberian, traps, eruptions, was, pyroclastic, ash, thrown, high, into, the, atmosphere, increasing, the, short, term, cooling, effect, when, this, had, washed, out, of, the, atmosphere, the, excess, carbon, dioxide, would, have, remained, and, global, warming, would, have, proceeded, unchecked, burning, of, hydrocarbon, deposits, may, have, exacerbated, the, extinction, the, siberian, traps, are, underlain, by, thick, sequences, of, early, mid, paleozoic, aged, carbonate, and, evaporite, deposits, as, well, as, carboniferous, permian, aged, coal, bearing, clastic, rocks, when, heated, such, as, by, igneous, intrusions, these, rocks, may, emit, large, amounts, of, greenhouse, and, toxic, gases, the, unique, setting, of, the, siberian, traps, over, these, deposits, is, likely, the, reason, for, the, severity, of, the, extinction, the, basalt, lava, erupted, or, intruded, into, carbonate, rocks, and, sediments, in, the, process, of, forming, large, coal, beds, which, would, have, emitted, large, amounts, of, carbon, dioxide, leading, to, stronger, global, warming, after, the, dust, and, aerosols, settled, the, change, of, the, eruptions, from, flood, basalt, to, sill, dominated, emplacement, liberating, even, more, trapped, hydrocarbon, deposits, coincides, with, the, main, onset, of, the, extinction, and, is, linked, to, a, major, negative, 13, c, excursion, the, intermediate, temperature, of, the, siberian, traps, magmas, optimised, the, extremely, voluminous, release, of, co, 2, by, way, of, heating, of, evaporites, and, carbonates, venting, of, coal, derived, methane, was, accompanied, by, explosive, combustion, of, coal, and, discharge, of, coal, fly, ash, a, 2011, study, led, by, stephen, e, grasby, reported, evidence, that, volcanism, caused, massive, coal, beds, to, ignite, possibly, releasing, more, than, 3, trillion, tons, of, carbon, they, found, ash, deposits, in, deep, rock, layers, near, what, is, now, the, buchanan, lake, formation, coal, ash, dispersed, by, the, explosive, siberian, trap, eruption, would, be, expected, to, have, an, associated, release, of, toxic, elements, in, impacted, water, bodies, where, fly, ash, slurries, developed, mafic, megascale, eruptions, are, long, lived, events, that, would, allow, significant, build, up, of, global, ash, clouds, grasby, said, in, addition, to, these, volcanoes, causing, fires, through, coal, the, ash, it, spewed, was, highly, toxic, and, was, released, in, the, land, and, water, potentially, contributing, to, the, worst, extinction, event, in, earth, history, however, some, researchers, propose, that, these, supposed, fly, ashes, were, actually, the, result, of, wildfires, not, related, to, massive, coal, combustion, by, intrusive, magmatism, a, 2013, study, led, by, q, y, yang, reported, that, the, total, amounts, of, important, volatiles, emitted, from, the, siberian, traps, consisted, of, 8, 5, 10, 7, tg, co, 2, 4, 4, 10, 6, tg, co, 7, 0, 10, 6, tg, h, 2, s, and, 6, 8, 10, 7, tg, so, 2, the, sill, dominated, emplacement, of, the, siberian, traps, prolonged, their, warming, effects, whereas, extrusive, volcanism, generates, an, abundance, of, subaerial, basalts, that, efficiently, sequester, carbon, dioxide, via, the, silicate, weathering, process, underground, sills, cannot, sequester, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, and, mitigate, global, warming, additionally, enhanced, reverse, weathering, and, depletion, of, siliceous, carbon, sinks, enabled, extreme, warmth, to, persist, for, much, longer, than, expected, if, the, excess, carbon, dioxide, was, sequestered, by, silicate, rock, the, decline, in, biological, silicate, deposition, resulting, from, the, mass, extinction, of, siliceous, organisms, acted, as, a, positive, feedback, loop, wherein, mass, death, of, marine, life, exacerbated, and, prolonged, extreme, hothouse, conditions, mercury, anomalies, corresponding, to, the, time, of, siberian, traps, activity, have, been, found, in, many, geographically, disparate, sites, indicating, that, these, volcanic, eruptions, released, significant, quantities, of, toxic, mercury, into, the, atmosphere, and, ocean, causing, even, larger, terrestrial, and, marine, die, offs, a, series, of, surges, raised, terrestrial, and, marine, environmental, mercury, concentrations, by, orders, of, magnitude, above, normal, background, levels, and, caused, mercury, poisoning, over, periods, of, a, thousand, years, each, mutagenesis, in, surviving, plants, after, the, ptme, coeval, with, mercury, and, copper, loading, confirms, volcanically, induced, heavy, metal, toxicity, increased, bioproductivity, may, have, sequestered, mercury, and, party, mitigated, poisoning, immense, volumes, of, nickel, aerosols, and, cobalt, and, arsenic, emisions, were, also, released, further, contributing, to, metal, poisoning, the, devastation, wrought, by, the, siberian, traps, did, not, end, following, the, permian, triassic, boundary, carbon, isotope, fluctuations, suggest, that, massive, siberian, traps, activity, recurred, many, times, during, the, early, triassic, a, finding, corroborated, by, mercury, spikes, causing, further, extinction, events, during, the, epoch, a, second, flood, basalt, event, that, produced, the, choiyoi, silicic, large, igneous, province, in, southwestern, gondwana, between, around, 286, ma, and, 247, ma, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, significant, additional, extinction, mechanism, at, 1, 300, 000, cubic, kilometres, in, volume, and, 1, 680, 000, square, kilometres, in, area, this, event, was, 40, the, size, of, the, siberian, traps, specifically, this, flood, basalt, has, been, implicated, in, the, regional, demise, of, the, gondwanan, glossopteris, flora, mercury, anomalies, preceding, the, end, permian, extinction, have, been, discovered, in, what, was, then, the, boundary, between, the, south, china, craton, and, the, indochinese, plate, a, subduction, zone, with, a, volcanic, arc, hafnium, isotopes, from, syndepositional, magmatic, zircons, found, in, ash, beds, created, by, this, volcanic, pulse, confirm, its, origin, in, subduction, zone, volcanism, rather, than, large, igneous, province, activity, the, enrichment, of, copper, samples, from, these, deposits, in, isotopically, light, copper, provide, additional, confirmation, this, volcanism, has, been, speculated, to, have, caused, local, biotic, stress, among, radiolarians, sponges, and, brachiopods, over, the, 60, 000, years, preceding, the, end, permian, marine, extinction, as, well, as, an, ammonoid, crisis, with, decreased, morphological, complexity, and, size, and, increased, rate, of, turnover, beginning, in, the, lower, c, yini, biozone, around, 200, 000, years, before, the, extinction, methane, clathrates, also, known, as, methane, hydrates, consist, of, molecules, of, methane, trapped, in, the, crystal, lattice, of, ice, this, methane, produced, by, methanogen, microbes, has, a, 13, c, 12, c, isotope, ratio, about, 6, below, normal, 13, c, 6, 0, at, the, right, combination, of, pressure, and, temperature, clathrates, form, near, the, surface, of, permafrost, and, in, large, quantities, on, continental, shelves, and, nearby, seabed, at, water, depths, of, at, least, 300, m, 980, ft, buried, in, sediments, up, to, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, below, the, sea, floor, massive, release, of, methane, from, these, clathrates, may, have, contributed, to, the, ptme, as, scientists, have, found, worldwide, evidence, of, a, swift, decrease, of, about, 1, in, the, 13, c, 12, c, ratio, in, carbonate, rocks, from, the, end, permian, this, is, the, first, largest, and, fastest, of, a, series, of, excursions, decreases, and, increases, in, the, ratio, until, it, abruptly, stabilised, in, the, middle, triassic, followed, soon, afterwards, by, the, recovery, of, calcifying, shelled, sealife, the, seabed, probably, contained, methane, hydrate, deposits, and, the, lava, caused, the, deposits, to, dissociate, releasing, vast, quantities, of, methane, a, vast, release, of, methane, might, cause, significant, global, warming, since, methane, is, a, very, powerful, greenhouse, gas, strong, evidence, suggests, the, global, temperatures, increased, by, about, 6, c, 10, 8, f, near, the, equator, and, therefore, by, more, at, higher, latitudes, a, sharp, decrease, in, oxygen, isotope, ratios, 18, o, 16, o, the, extinction, of, glossopteris, flora, glossopteris, and, plants, that, grew, in, the, same, areas, which, needed, a, cold, climate, with, its, replacement, by, floras, typical, of, lower, paleolatitudes, it, was, also, suggested, that, a, large, scale, release, of, methane, and, other, greenhouse, gases, from, the, ocean, into, the, atmosphere, was, connected, to, the, anoxic, events, and, euxinic, sulfidic, events, at, the, time, with, the, exact, mechanism, compared, to, the, 1986, lake, nyos, disaster, the, clathrate, hypothesis, seemed, the, only, proposed, mechanism, sufficient, to, cause, a, global, 1, reduction, in, the, 13, c, 12, c, ratio, while, a, variety, of, factors, may, have, contributed, to, the, ratio, drop, a, 2002, review, found, most, of, them, insufficient, to, account, for, the, observed, amount, however, the, clathrate, hypothesis, has, also, been, criticized, carbon, cycle, models, which, include, consideration, of, roasting, carbonate, sediments, by, volcanism, confirm, that, it, would, have, had, enough, effect, to, produce, the, observed, reduction, also, the, pattern, of, isotope, shifts, expected, to, result, from, a, massive, release, of, methane, does, not, match, the, patterns, seen, throughout, the, early, triassic, not, only, would, such, a, cause, require, the, release, of, five, times, as, much, methane, as, postulated, for, the, petm, but, would, it, also, have, to, be, reburied, at, an, unrealistically, high, rate, to, account, for, the, rapid, increases, in, the, 13, c, 12, c, ratio, episodes, of, high, positive, 13, c, throughout, the, early, triassic, before, it, was, released, several, times, again, the, latest, research, suggests, that, greenhouse, gas, release, during, the, extinction, event, was, dominated, by, volcanic, carbon, dioxide, and, while, methane, release, had, to, have, contributed, isotopic, signatures, show, that, thermogenic, methane, released, from, the, siberian, traps, had, consistently, played, a, larger, role, than, methane, from, clathrates, and, any, other, biogenic, sources, such, as, wetlands, during, the, event, adding, to, the, evidence, against, methane, clathrate, release, as, the, central, driver, of, warming, the, main, rapid, warming, event, is, also, associated, with, marine, transgression, rather, than, regression, the, former, would, not, normally, have, initiated, methane, release, which, would, have, instead, required, a, decrease, in, pressure, something, that, would, be, generated, by, a, retreat, of, shallow, seas, the, configuration, of, the, world, s, landmasses, into, one, supercontinent, would, also, mean, that, the, global, gas, hydrate, reservoir, was, lower, than, today, further, damaging, the, case, for, methane, clathrate, dissolution, as, a, major, cause, of, the, carbon, cycle, disruption, marine, organisms, are, more, sensitive, to, changes, in, co, 2, carbon, dioxide, levels, than, terrestrial, organisms, for, a, variety, of, reasons, co, 2, is, 28, times, more, soluble, in, water, than, is, oxygen, marine, animals, normally, function, with, lower, concentrations, of, co, 2, in, their, bodies, than, land, animals, as, the, removal, of, co, 2, in, air, breathing, animals, is, impeded, by, the, need, for, the, gas, to, pass, through, the, respiratory, system, s, membranes, lungs, alveolus, tracheae, and, the, like, even, when, co, 2, diffuses, more, easily, than, oxygen, in, marine, organisms, relatively, modest, but, sustained, increases, in, co, 2, concentrations, hamper, the, synthesis, of, proteins, reduce, fertilization, rates, and, produce, deformities, in, calcareous, hard, parts, higher, concentrations, of, co, 2, also, result, in, decreased, activity, levels, in, many, active, marine, animals, hindering, their, ability, to, obtain, food, an, analysis, of, marine, fossils, from, the, permian, s, final, changhsingian, stage, found, that, marine, organisms, with, a, low, tolerance, for, hypercapnia, high, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, had, high, extinction, rates, and, the, most, tolerant, organisms, had, very, slight, losses, the, most, vulnerable, marine, organisms, were, those, that, produced, calcareous, hard, parts, from, calcium, carbonate, and, had, low, metabolic, rates, and, weak, respiratory, systems, notably, calcareous, sponges, rugose, and, tabulate, corals, calcite, depositing, brachiopods, bryozoans, and, echinoderms, about, 81, of, such, genera, became, extinct, close, relatives, without, calcareous, hard, parts, suffered, only, minor, losses, such, as, sea, anemones, from, which, modern, corals, evolved, animals, with, high, metabolic, rates, well, developed, respiratory, systems, and, non, calcareous, hard, parts, had, negligible, losses, except, for, conodonts, in, which, 33, of, genera, died, out, this, pattern, is, also, consistent, with, what, is, known, about, the, effects, of, hypoxia, a, shortage, but, not, total, absence, of, oxygen, however, hypoxia, cannot, have, been, the, only, killing, mechanism, for, marine, organisms, nearly, all, of, the, continental, shelf, waters, would, have, had, to, become, severely, hypoxic, to, account, for, the, magnitude, of, the, extinction, but, such, a, catastrophe, would, make, it, difficult, to, explain, the, very, selective, pattern, of, the, extinction, mathematical, models, of, the, late, permian, and, early, triassic, atmospheres, show, a, significant, but, protracted, decline, in, atmospheric, oxygen, levels, with, no, acceleration, near, the, p, tr, boundary, minimum, atmospheric, oxygen, levels, in, the, early, triassic, are, never, less, than, present, day, levels, and, so, the, decline, in, oxygen, levels, does, not, match, the, temporal, pattern, of, the, extinction, in, addition, an, increase, in, co, 2, concentration, is, inevitably, linked, to, ocean, acidification, consistent, with, the, preferential, extinction, of, heavily, calcified, taxa, and, other, signals, in, the, rock, record, that, suggest, a, more, acidic, ocean, the, decrease, in, ocean, ph, is, calculated, to, be, up, to, 0, 7, units, an, extreme, aragonite, sea, formed, ocean, acidification, was, most, extreme, at, mid, latitudes, and, the, major, marine, transgression, associated, with, the, end, permian, extinction, is, believed, to, have, devastated, shallow, shelf, communities, in, conjunction, with, anoxia, evidence, from, paralic, facies, spanning, the, permian, triassic, boundary, in, western, guizhou, and, eastern, yunnan, however, shows, a, local, marine, transgression, dominated, by, carbonate, deposition, suggesting, that, ocean, acidification, did, not, occur, across, the, entire, globe, and, was, likely, limited, to, certain, regions, of, the, world, s, oceans, one, study, published, in, scientific, reports, concluded, that, widespread, ocean, acidification, if, it, did, occur, was, not, intense, enough, to, impede, calcification, and, only, occurred, during, the, beginning, of, the, extinction, event, the, relative, success, of, many, marine, organisms, that, were, very, vulnerable, to, acidification, has, further, been, used, to, argue, that, acidification, was, not, a, major, extinction, contributor, the, persistence, of, highly, elevated, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere, and, ocean, during, the, early, triassic, would, have, impeded, the, recovery, of, biocalcifying, organisms, after, the, ptme, acidity, generated, by, increased, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, in, soil, and, sulphur, dioxide, dissolution, in, rainwater, was, also, a, kill, mechanism, on, land, the, increasing, acidification, of, rainwater, caused, increased, soil, erosion, as, a, result, of, the, increased, acidity, of, forest, soils, evidenced, by, the, increased, influx, of, terrestrially, derived, organic, sediments, found, in, marine, sedimentary, deposits, during, the, end, permian, extinction, further, evidence, of, an, increase, in, soil, acidity, comes, from, elevated, ba, sr, ratios, in, earliest, triassic, soils, a, positive, feedback, loop, further, enhancing, and, prolonging, soil, acidification, may, have, resulted, from, the, decline, of, infaunal, invertebrates, like, tubificids, and, chironomids, which, remove, acid, metabolites, from, the, soil, the, increased, abundance, of, vermiculitic, clays, in, shansi, south, china, coinciding, with, the, permian, triassic, boundary, strongly, suggests, a, sharp, drop, in, soil, ph, causally, related, to, volcanogenic, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, and, sulphur, dioxide, hopane, anomalies, have, also, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, acidic, soils, and, peats, as, with, many, other, environmental, stressors, acidity, on, land, episodically, persisted, well, into, the, triassic, stunting, the, recovery, of, terrestrial, ecosystems, evidence, for, widespread, ocean, anoxia, severe, deficiency, of, oxygen, and, euxinia, presence, of, hydrogen, sulfide, is, found, from, the, late, permian, to, the, early, triassic, throughout, most, of, the, tethys, and, panthalassic, oceans, evidence, for, anoxia, appears, at, the, extinction, event, including, small, pyrite, framboids, negative, 238, u, excursions, negative, 15, n, excursions, positive, 82, 78, se, isotope, excursions, relatively, positive, 13, c, ratios, in, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, high, th, u, ratios, positive, ce, ce, anomalies, depletions, of, molybdenum, uranium, and, vanadium, from, seawater, and, fine, laminations, in, sediments, however, evidence, for, anoxia, precedes, the, extinction, at, some, other, sites, including, spiti, india, shangsi, china, meishan, china, opal, creek, alberta, and, kap, stosch, greenland, biogeochemical, evidence, also, points, to, the, presence, of, euxinia, during, the, ptme, biomarkers, for, green, sulfur, bacteria, such, as, isorenieratane, the, diagenetic, product, of, isorenieratene, are, widely, used, as, indicators, of, photic, zone, euxinia, because, green, sulfur, bacteria, require, both, sunlight, and, hydrogen, sulfide, to, survive, their, abundance, in, sediments, from, the, p, t, boundary, indicates, euxinic, conditions, were, present, even, in, the, shallow, waters, of, the, photic, zone, negative, mercury, isotope, excursions, further, bolster, evidence, for, extensive, euxinia, during, the, ptme, the, disproportionate, extinction, of, high, latitude, marine, species, provides, further, evidence, for, oxygen, depletion, as, a, killing, mechanism, low, latitude, species, living, in, warmer, less, oxygenated, waters, are, naturally, better, adapted, to, lower, levels, of, oxygen, and, are, able, to, migrate, to, higher, latitudes, during, periods, of, global, warming, whereas, high, latitude, organisms, are, unable, to, escape, from, warming, hypoxic, waters, at, the, poles, evidence, of, a, lag, between, volcanic, mercury, inputs, and, biotic, turnovers, provides, further, support, for, anoxia, and, euxinia, as, the, key, killing, mechanism, because, extinctions, would, be, expected, to, be, synchronous, with, volcanic, mercury, discharge, if, volcanism, and, hypercapnia, was, the, primary, driver, of, extinction, the, sequence, of, events, leading, to, anoxic, oceans, may, have, been, triggered, by, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, the, eruption, of, the, siberian, traps, in, that, scenario, warming, from, the, enhanced, greenhouse, effect, would, reduce, the, solubility, of, oxygen, in, seawater, causing, the, concentration, of, oxygen, to, decline, increased, coastal, evaporation, would, have, caused, the, formation, of, warm, saline, bottom, water, wsbw, depleted, in, oxygen, and, nutrients, which, spread, across, the, world, through, the, deep, oceans, the, influx, of, wsbw, caused, thermal, expansion, of, water, that, raised, sea, levels, bringing, anoxic, waters, onto, shallow, shelfs, and, enhancing, the, formation, of, wsbw, in, a, positive, feedback, loop, the, flux, of, terrigeneous, material, into, the, oceans, increased, as, a, result, of, soil, erosion, which, would, have, facilitated, increased, eutrophication, increased, chemical, weathering, of, the, continents, due, to, warming, and, the, acceleration, of, the, water, cycle, would, increase, the, riverine, flux, of, nutrients, to, the, ocean, additionally, the, siberian, traps, directly, fertilised, the, oceans, with, iron, and, phosphorus, as, well, triggering, bioblooms, and, marine, snowstorms, increased, phosphate, levels, would, have, supported, greater, primary, productivity, in, the, surface, oceans, the, increase, in, organic, matter, production, would, have, caused, more, organic, matter, to, sink, into, the, deep, ocean, where, its, respiration, would, further, decrease, oxygen, concentrations, once, anoxia, became, established, it, would, have, been, sustained, by, a, positive, feedback, loop, because, deep, water, anoxia, tends, to, increase, the, recycling, efficiency, of, phosphate, leading, to, even, higher, productivity, along, the, panthalassan, coast, of, south, china, oxygen, decline, was, also, driven, by, large, scale, upwelling, of, deep, water, enriched, in, various, nutrients, causing, this, region, of, the, ocean, to, be, hit, by, especially, severe, anoxia, convective, overturn, helped, facilitate, the, expansion, of, anoxia, throughout, the, water, column, a, severe, anoxic, event, at, the, end, of, the, permian, would, have, allowed, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, to, thrive, causing, the, production, of, large, amounts, of, hydrogen, sulfide, in, the, anoxic, ocean, turning, it, euxinic, in, some, regions, anoxia, briefly, disappeared, when, transient, cold, snaps, resulting, from, volcanic, sulphur, emissions, occurred, this, spread, of, toxic, oxygen, depleted, water, would, have, devastated, marine, life, causing, widespread, die, offs, models, of, ocean, chemistry, suggest, that, anoxia, and, euxinia, were, closely, associated, with, hypercapnia, high, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, this, suggests, that, poisoning, from, hydrogen, sulfide, anoxia, and, hypercapnia, acted, together, as, a, killing, mechanism, hypercapnia, best, explains, the, selectivity, of, the, extinction, but, anoxia, and, euxinia, probably, contributed, to, the, high, mortality, of, the, event, the, persistence, of, anoxia, through, the, early, triassic, may, explain, the, slow, recovery, of, marine, life, and, low, levels, of, biodiversity, after, the, extinction, particularly, that, of, benthic, organisms, anoxia, disappeared, from, shallow, waters, more, rapidly, than, the, deep, ocean, reexpansions, of, oxygen, minimum, zones, did, not, cease, until, the, late, spathian, periodically, setting, back, and, restarting, the, biotic, recovery, process, the, decline, in, continental, weathering, towards, the, end, of, the, spathian, at, last, began, ameliorating, marine, life, from, recurrent, anoxia, in, some, regions, of, panthalassa, pelagic, zone, anoxia, continued, to, recur, as, late, as, the, anisian, probably, due, to, increased, productivity, and, a, return, of, aeolian, upwelling, some, sections, show, a, rather, quick, return, to, oxic, water, column, conditions, however, so, for, how, long, anoxia, persisted, remains, debated, the, volatility, of, the, early, triassic, sulphur, cycle, suggests, marine, life, continued, to, face, returns, of, euxinia, as, well, some, scientists, have, challenged, the, anoxia, hypothesis, on, the, grounds, that, long, lasting, anoxic, conditions, could, not, have, been, supported, if, late, permian, thermohaline, ocean, circulation, conformed, to, the, thermal, mode, characterised, by, cooling, at, high, latitudes, anoxia, may, have, persisted, under, a, haline, mode, in, which, circulation, was, driven, by, subtropical, evaporation, although, the, haline, mode, is, highly, unstable, and, was, unlikely, to, have, represented, late, permian, oceanic, circulation, oxygen, depletion, via, extensive, microbial, blooms, also, played, a, role, in, the, biological, collapse, of, not, just, marine, ecosystems, but, freshwater, ones, as, well, persistent, lack, of, oxygen, after, the, extinction, event, itself, helped, delay, biotic, recovery, for, much, of, the, early, triassic, epoch, increasing, continental, aridity, a, trend, well, underway, even, before, the, ptme, as, a, result, of, the, coalescence, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, was, drastically, exacerbated, by, terminal, permian, volcanism, and, global, warming, the, combination, of, global, warming, and, drying, generated, an, increased, incidence, of, wildfires, tropical, coastal, swamp, floras, such, as, those, in, south, china, may, have, been, very, detrimentally, impacted, by, the, increase, in, wildfires, though, it, is, ultimately, unclear, if, an, increase, in, wildfires, played, a, role, in, driving, taxa, to, extinction, aridification, trends, varied, widely, in, their, tempo, and, regional, impact, analysis, of, the, fossil, river, deposits, of, the, floodplains, of, the, karoo, basin, indicate, a, shift, from, meandering, to, braided, river, patterns, indicating, a, very, abrupt, drying, of, the, climate, the, climate, change, may, have, taken, as, little, as, 100, 000, years, prompting, the, extinction, of, the, unique, glossopteris, flora, and, its, associated, herbivores, followed, by, the, carnivorous, guild, a, pattern, of, aridity, induced, extinctions, that, progressively, ascended, up, the, food, chain, has, been, deduced, from, karoo, basin, biostratigraphy, evidence, for, aridification, in, the, karoo, across, the, permian, triassic, boundary, is, not, however, universal, as, some, palaeosol, evidence, indicates, a, wettening, of, the, local, climate, during, the, transition, between, the, two, geologic, periods, evidence, from, the, sydney, basin, of, eastern, australia, on, the, other, hand, suggests, that, the, expansion, of, semi, arid, and, arid, climatic, belts, across, pangaea, was, not, immediate, but, was, instead, a, gradual, prolonged, process, apart, from, the, disappearance, of, peatlands, there, was, little, evidence, of, significant, sedimentological, changes, in, depositional, style, across, the, permian, triassic, boundary, instead, a, modest, shift, to, amplified, seasonality, and, hotter, summers, is, suggested, by, palaeoclimatological, models, based, on, weathering, proxies, from, the, region, s, late, permian, and, early, triassic, deposits, in, the, kuznetsk, basin, of, southwestern, siberia, an, increase, in, aridity, led, to, the, demise, of, the, humid, adapted, cordaites, forests, in, the, region, a, few, hundred, thousand, years, before, the, permian, triassic, boundary, drying, of, this, basin, has, been, attributed, to, a, broader, poleward, shift, of, drier, more, arid, climates, during, the, late, changhsingian, before, the, more, abrupt, main, phase, of, the, extinction, at, the, permian, triassic, boundary, that, disproportionately, affected, tropical, and, subtropical, species, the, persistence, of, hyperaridity, varied, regionally, as, well, in, the, north, china, basin, highly, arid, climatic, conditions, are, recorded, during, the, latest, permian, near, the, permian, triassic, boundary, with, a, swing, towards, increased, precipitation, during, the, early, triassic, the, latter, likely, assisting, biotic, recovery, following, the, mass, extinction, elsewhere, such, as, in, the, karoo, basin, episodes, of, dry, climate, recurred, regularly, in, the, early, triassic, with, profound, effects, on, terrestrial, tetrapods, the, types, and, diversity, of, ichnofossils, in, a, locality, has, been, used, as, an, indicator, measuring, aridity, nurra, an, ichnofossil, site, on, the, island, of, sardinia, shows, evidence, of, major, drought, related, stress, among, crustaceans, whereas, the, permian, subnetwork, at, nurra, displays, extensive, horizontal, backfilled, traces, and, high, ichnodiversity, the, early, triassic, subnetwork, is, characterised, by, an, absence, of, backfilled, traces, an, ichnological, sign, of, aridification, a, collapse, of, the, atmospheric, ozone, shield, has, been, invoked, as, an, explanation, for, the, mass, extinction, particularly, that, of, terrestrial, plants, ozone, production, may, have, been, reduced, by, 60, 70, increasing, the, flux, of, ultraviolet, radiation, by, 400, at, equatorial, latitudes, and, 5, 000, at, polar, latitudes, the, hypothesis, has, the, advantage, of, explaining, the, mass, extinction, of, plants, which, would, have, added, to, the, methane, levels, and, should, otherwise, have, thrived, in, an, atmosphere, with, a, high, level, of, carbon, dioxide, fossil, spores, from, the, end, permian, further, support, the, theory, many, spores, show, deformities, that, could, have, been, caused, by, ultraviolet, radiation, which, would, have, been, more, intense, after, hydrogen, sulfide, emissions, weakened, the, ozone, layer, malformed, plant, spores, from, the, time, of, the, extinction, event, show, an, increase, in, ultraviolet, b, absorbing, compounds, confirming, that, increased, ultraviolet, radiation, played, a, role, in, the, environmental, catastrophe, and, excluding, other, possible, causes, of, mutagenesis, such, as, heavy, metal, toxicity, in, these, mutated, spores, extremely, positive, 33, s, anomalies, provide, evidence, of, photolysis, of, volcanic, so, 2, indicating, increased, ultraviolet, radiation, flux, sulphur, isotope, data, from, north, china, are, inconsistent, with, a, total, collapse, of, the, ozone, layer, however, suggesting, it, may, have, not, been, as, major, a, kill, mechanism, as, others, multiple, mechanisms, could, have, reduced, the, ozone, shield, and, rendered, it, ineffective, computer, modelling, shows, high, atmospheric, methane, levels, are, associated, with, ozone, shield, decline, and, may, have, contributed, to, its, reduction, during, the, ptme, volcanic, emissions, of, sulphate, aerosols, into, the, stratosphere, would, have, dealt, significant, destruction, to, the, ozone, layer, as, mentioned, previously, the, rocks, in, the, region, where, the, siberian, traps, were, emplaced, are, extremely, rich, in, halogens, the, intrusion, of, siberian, traps, volcanism, into, deposits, rich, in, organohalogens, such, as, methyl, bromide, and, methyl, chloride, would, have, been, another, source, of, ozone, destruction, an, uptick, in, wildfires, a, natural, source, of, methyl, chloride, would, have, had, further, deleterious, effects, still, on, the, atmospheric, ozone, shield, upwelling, of, euxinic, water, may, have, released, massive, hydrogen, sulphide, emissions, into, the, atmosphere, and, would, poison, terrestrial, plants, and, animals, and, severely, weaken, the, ozone, layer, exposing, much, of, the, life, that, remained, to, fatal, levels, of, uv, radiation, although, other, modelling, work, has, found, that, the, release, of, this, gas, would, not, have, significantly, damaged, the, ozone, layer, indeed, biomarker, evidence, for, anaerobic, photosynthesis, by, chlorobiaceae, green, sulfur, bacteria, from, the, late, permian, into, the, early, triassic, indicates, that, hydrogen, sulphide, did, upwell, into, shallow, waters, because, these, bacteria, are, restricted, to, the, photic, zone, and, use, sulfide, as, an, electron, donor, evidence, that, an, impact, event, may, have, caused, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, has, led, to, speculation, that, similar, impacts, may, have, been, the, cause, of, other, extinction, events, including, the, p, tr, extinction, and, thus, to, a, search, for, evidence, of, impacts, at, the, times, of, other, extinctions, such, as, large, impact, craters, of, the, appropriate, age, however, suggestions, that, an, asteroid, impact, was, the, trigger, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, are, now, largely, rejected, reported, evidence, for, an, impact, event, from, the, p, tr, boundary, level, includes, rare, grains, of, shocked, quartz, in, australia, and, antarctica, fullerenes, trapping, extraterrestrial, noble, gases, meteorite, fragments, in, antarctica, and, grains, rich, in, iron, nickel, and, silicon, which, may, have, been, created, by, an, impact, however, the, accuracy, of, most, of, these, claims, has, been, challenged, for, example, quartz, from, graphite, peak, in, antarctica, once, considered, shocked, has, been, re, examined, by, optical, and, transmission, electron, microscopy, the, observed, features, were, concluded, to, be, due, not, to, shock, but, rather, to, plastic, deformation, consistent, with, formation, in, a, tectonic, environment, such, as, volcanism, iridium, levels, in, many, sites, straddling, the, permian, triassic, boundaries, are, not, anomalous, providing, evidence, against, an, extraterrestrial, impact, as, the, ptme, s, cause, an, impact, crater, on, the, seafloor, would, be, evidence, of, a, possible, cause, of, the, p, tr, extinction, but, such, a, crater, would, by, now, have, disappeared, as, 70, of, the, earth, s, surface, is, currently, sea, an, asteroid, or, comet, fragment, is, now, perhaps, more, than, twice, as, likely, to, hit, the, ocean, as, it, is, to, hit, land, however, earth, s, oldest, ocean, floor, crust, is, only, 200, million, years, old, as, it, is, continually, being, destroyed, and, renewed, by, spreading, and, subduction, furthermore, craters, produced, by, very, large, impacts, may, be, masked, by, extensive, flood, basalting, from, below, after, the, crust, is, punctured, or, weakened, yet, subduction, should, not, be, entirely, accepted, as, an, explanation, for, the, lack, of, evidence, as, with, the, k, t, event, an, ejecta, blanket, stratum, rich, in, siderophilic, elements, such, as, iridium, would, be, expected, in, formations, from, the, time, a, large, impact, might, have, triggered, other, mechanisms, of, extinction, described, above, such, as, the, siberian, traps, eruptions, at, either, an, impact, site, or, the, antipode, of, an, impact, site, the, abruptness, of, an, impact, also, explains, why, more, species, did, not, rapidly, evolve, to, survive, as, would, be, expected, if, the, permian, triassic, event, had, been, slower, and, less, global, than, a, meteorite, impact, bolide, impact, claims, have, been, criticised, on, the, grounds, that, they, are, unnecessary, as, explanations, for, the, extinctions, and, they, do, not, fit, the, known, data, compatible, with, a, protracted, extinction, spanning, thousands, of, years, additionally, many, sites, spanning, the, permian, triassic, boundary, display, a, complete, lack, of, evidence, of, an, impact, event, possible, impact, craters, proposed, as, the, site, of, an, impact, causing, the, p, tr, extinction, include, the, 250, km, 160, mi, bedout, structure, off, the, northwest, coast, of, australia, and, the, hypothesized, 480, km, 300, mi, wilkes, land, crater, of, east, antarctica, an, impact, has, not, been, proved, in, either, case, and, the, idea, has, been, widely, criticized, the, wilkes, land, geophysical, feature, is, of, very, uncertain, age, possibly, later, than, the, permian, triassic, extinction, another, impact, hypothesis, postulates, that, the, impact, event, which, formed, the, araguainha, crater, whose, formation, has, been, dated, to, 254, 7, 2, 5, million, a, possible, temporal, range, overlapping, with, the, end, permian, extinction, precipitated, the, mass, extinction, the, impact, occurred, around, extensive, deposits, of, oil, shale, in, the, shallow, marine, paran, karoo, basin, whose, perturbation, by, the, seismicity, resulting, from, impact, likely, discharged, about, 1, 6, teratonnes, of, methane, into, earth, s, atmosphere, buttressing, the, already, rapid, warming, caused, by, hydrocarbon, release, due, to, the, siberian, traps, the, large, earthquakes, generated, by, the, impact, would, have, additionally, generated, massive, tsunamis, across, much, of, the, globe, despite, this, most, palaeontologists, reject, the, impact, as, being, a, significant, driver, of, the, extinction, citing, the, relatively, low, energy, equivalent, to, 10, 5, to, 10, 6, of, tnt, around, two, orders, of, magnitude, lower, than, the, impact, energy, believed, to, be, required, to, induce, mass, extinctions, released, by, the, impact, a, 2017, paper, noted, the, discovery, of, a, circular, gravity, anomaly, near, the, falkland, islands, which, might, correspond, to, an, impact, crater, with, a, diameter, of, 250, km, 160, mi, as, supported, by, seismic, and, magnetic, evidence, estimates, for, the, age, of, the, structure, range, up, to, 250, million, years, old, this, would, be, substantially, larger, than, the, well, known, 180, km, 110, mi, chicxulub, impact, crater, associated, with, a, later, extinction, however, dave, mccarthy, and, colleagues, from, the, british, geological, survey, illustrated, that, the, gravity, anomaly, is, not, circular, and, also, that, the, seismic, data, presented, by, rocca, rampino, and, baez, presser, did, not, cross, the, proposed, crater, or, provide, any, evidence, for, an, impact, crater, a, hypothesis, published, in, 2014, posits, that, a, genus, of, anaerobic, methanogenic, archaea, known, as, methanosarcina, was, responsible, for, the, event, three, lines, of, evidence, suggest, that, these, microbes, acquired, a, new, metabolic, pathway, via, gene, transfer, at, about, that, time, enabling, them, to, efficiently, metabolize, acetate, into, methane, that, would, have, led, to, their, exponential, reproduction, allowing, them, to, rapidly, consume, vast, deposits, of, organic, carbon, that, had, accumulated, in, marine, sediment, the, result, would, have, been, a, sharp, buildup, of, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, oceans, and, atmosphere, in, a, manner, that, may, be, consistent, with, the, 13, c, 12, c, isotopic, record, massive, volcanism, facilitated, this, process, by, releasing, large, amounts, of, nickel, a, scarce, metal, which, is, a, cofactor, for, enzymes, involved, in, producing, methane, chemostratigraphic, analysis, of, permian, triassic, boundary, sediments, in, chaotian, demonstrates, a, methanogenic, burst, could, be, responsible, for, some, percentage, of, the, carbon, isotopic, fluctuations, on, the, other, hand, in, the, canonical, meishan, sections, the, nickel, concentration, increases, somewhat, after, the, 13, c, concentrations, have, begun, to, fall, john, gribbin, argues, that, the, solar, system, last, passed, through, a, spiral, arm, of, the, milky, way, around, 250, million, years, ago, and, that, the, resultant, dusty, gas, clouds, may, have, caused, a, dimming, of, the, sun, which, combined, with, the, effect, of, pangaea, to, produce, an, ice, age, the, ptme, has, been, compared, to, the, current, anthropogenic, global, warming, situation, and, holocene, extinction, due, to, sharing, the, common, characteristic, of, rapid, rates, of, carbon, dioxide, release, though, the, current, rate, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, is, more, than, an, order, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, rate, measured, over, the, course, of, the, ptme, the, discharge, of, greenhouse, gases, during, the, ptme, is, poorly, constrained, geo, chronologically, and, was, most, likely, pulsed, and, constrained, to, a, few, key, short, intervals, rather, than, continuously, occurring, at, a, constant, rate, for, the, whole, extinction, interval, the, rate, of, carbon, release, within, these, intervals, was, likely, to, have, been, similar, in, timing, to, modern, anthropogenic, emissions, as, they, did, during, the, ptme, oceans, in, the, present, day, are, experiencing, drops, in, ph, and, in, oxygen, levels, prompting, further, comparisons, between, modern, anthropogenic, ecological, conditions, and, the, ptme, another, biocalcification, event, similar, in, its, effects, on, modern, marine, ecosystems, is, predicted, to, occur, if, carbon, dioxide, levels, continue, to, rise, the, changes, in, plant, insect, interactions, resulting, from, the, ptme, have, also, been, invoked, as, possible, indicators, of, the, world, s, future, ecology, the, similarities, between, the, two, extinction, events, have, led, to, warnings, from, geologists, about, the, urgent, need, for, reducing, carbon, dioxide, emissions, if, an, event, similar, to, the, ptme, is, to, be, prevented, from, occurring
