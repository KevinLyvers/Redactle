a, chemical, element, is, a, chemical, substance, that, cannot, be, broken, down, into, other, substances, by, chemical, reactions, the, basic, particle, that, constitutes, a, chemical, element, is, the, atom, elements, are, identified, by, the, number, of, protons, in, their, nucleus, known, as, the, element, s, atomic, number, for, example, oxygen, has, an, atomic, number, of, 8, meaning, each, oxygen, atom, has, 8, protons, in, its, nucleus, atoms, of, the, same, element, can, have, different, numbers, of, neutrons, in, their, nuclei, known, as, isotopes, of, the, element, two, or, more, atoms, can, combine, to, form, molecules, chemical, compounds, are, molecules, made, of, atoms, of, different, elements, while, mixtures, contain, atoms, of, different, elements, not, necessarily, combined, as, molecules, atoms, can, be, transformed, into, different, elements, in, nuclear, reactions, which, change, an, atom, s, atomic, number, almost, all, baryonic, matter, in, the, universe, is, composed, of, elements, among, rare, exceptions, are, neutron, stars, when, different, elements, undergo, chemical, reactions, atoms, are, rearranged, into, new, compounds, held, together, by, chemical, bonds, only, a, few, elements, such, as, silver, and, gold, are, found, uncombined, as, relatively, pure, native, element, minerals, nearly, all, other, naturally, occurring, elements, occur, in, the, earth, as, compounds, or, mixtures, air, is, mostly, a, mixture, of, molecular, nitrogen, and, oxygen, though, it, does, contain, compounds, including, carbon, dioxide, and, water, as, well, as, atomic, argon, a, noble, gas, which, is, chemically, inert, and, therefore, does, not, undergo, chemical, reactions, the, history, of, the, discovery, and, use, of, elements, began, with, early, human, societies, that, discovered, native, minerals, like, carbon, sulfur, copper, and, gold, though, the, modern, concept, of, an, element, was, not, yet, understood, attempts, to, classify, materials, such, as, these, resulted, in, the, concepts, of, classical, elements, alchemy, and, similar, theories, throughout, history, much, of, the, modern, understanding, of, elements, developed, from, the, work, of, dmitri, mendeleev, a, russian, chemist, who, published, the, first, recognizable, periodic, table, in, 1869, this, table, organizes, the, elements, by, increasing, atomic, number, into, rows, periods, in, which, the, columns, groups, share, recurring, periodic, physical, and, chemical, properties, the, periodic, table, summarizes, various, properties, of, the, elements, allowing, chemists, to, derive, relationships, between, them, and, to, make, predictions, about, elements, not, yet, discovered, and, potential, new, compounds, by, november, 2016, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, had, recognized, a, total, of, 118, elements, the, first, 94, occur, naturally, on, earth, and, the, remaining, 24, are, synthetic, elements, produced, in, nuclear, reactions, save, for, unstable, radioactive, elements, radioelements, which, decay, quickly, nearly, all, elements, are, available, industrially, in, varying, amounts, the, discovery, and, synthesis, of, further, new, elements, is, an, ongoing, area, of, scientific, study, the, lightest, elements, are, hydrogen, and, helium, both, created, by, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, in, the, first, 20, minutes, of, the, universe, in, a, ratio, of, around, 3, 1, by, mass, or, 12, 1, by, number, of, atoms, along, with, tiny, traces, of, the, next, two, elements, lithium, and, beryllium, almost, all, other, elements, found, in, nature, were, made, by, various, natural, methods, of, nucleosynthesis, on, earth, small, amounts, of, new, atoms, are, naturally, produced, in, nucleogenic, reactions, or, in, cosmogenic, processes, such, as, cosmic, ray, spallation, new, atoms, are, also, naturally, produced, on, earth, as, radiogenic, daughter, isotopes, of, ongoing, radioactive, decay, processes, such, as, alpha, decay, beta, decay, spontaneous, fission, cluster, decay, and, other, rarer, modes, of, decay, of, the, 94, naturally, occurring, elements, those, with, atomic, numbers, 1, through, 82, each, have, at, least, one, stable, isotope, except, for, technetium, element, 43, and, promethium, element, 61, which, have, no, stable, isotopes, isotopes, considered, stable, are, those, for, which, no, radioactive, decay, has, yet, been, observed, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 83, through, 94, are, unstable, to, the, point, that, radioactive, decay, of, all, isotopes, can, be, detected, some, of, these, elements, notably, bismuth, atomic, number, 83, thorium, atomic, number, 90, and, uranium, atomic, number, 92, have, one, or, more, isotopes, with, half, lives, long, enough, to, survive, as, remnants, of, the, explosive, stellar, nucleosynthesis, that, produced, the, heavy, metals, before, the, formation, of, our, solar, system, at, over, 1, 9, 10, 19, years, over, a, billion, times, longer, than, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, bismuth, 209, has, the, longest, known, alpha, decay, half, life, of, any, isotope, and, is, almost, always, considered, on, par, with, the, 80, stable, elements, the, heaviest, elements, those, beyond, plutonium, element, 94, undergo, radioactive, decay, with, half, lives, so, short, that, they, are, not, found, in, nature, and, must, be, synthesized, there, are, now, 118, known, elements, in, this, context, known, means, observed, well, enough, even, from, just, a, few, decay, products, to, have, been, differentiated, from, other, elements, most, recently, the, synthesis, of, element, 118, since, named, oganesson, was, reported, in, october, 2006, and, the, synthesis, of, element, 117, tennessine, was, reported, in, april, 2010, of, these, 118, elements, 94, occur, naturally, on, earth, six, of, these, occur, in, extreme, trace, quantities, technetium, atomic, number, 43, promethium, number, 61, astatine, number, 85, francium, number, 87, neptunium, number, 93, and, plutonium, number, 94, these, 94, elements, have, been, detected, in, the, universe, at, large, in, the, spectra, of, stars, and, also, supernovae, where, short, lived, radioactive, elements, are, newly, being, made, the, first, 94, elements, have, been, detected, directly, on, earth, as, primordial, nuclides, present, from, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, or, as, naturally, occurring, fission, or, transmutation, products, of, uranium, and, thorium, the, remaining, 24, heavier, elements, not, found, today, either, on, earth, or, in, astronomical, spectra, have, been, produced, artificially, all, are, radioactive, with, short, half, lives, if, any, of, these, elements, were, present, at, the, formation, of, earth, they, are, certain, to, have, completely, decayed, and, if, present, in, novae, are, in, quantities, too, small, to, have, been, noted, technetium, was, the, first, purportedly, non, naturally, occurring, element, synthesized, in, 1937, though, trace, amounts, of, technetium, have, since, been, found, in, nature, and, also, the, element, may, have, been, discovered, naturally, in, 1925, this, pattern, of, artificial, production, and, later, natural, discovery, has, been, repeated, with, several, other, radioactive, naturally, occurring, rare, elements, list, of, the, elements, are, available, by, name, atomic, number, density, melting, point, boiling, point, and, chemical, symbol, as, well, as, ionization, energy, the, nuclides, of, stable, and, radioactive, elements, are, also, available, as, a, list, of, nuclides, sorted, by, length, of, half, life, for, those, that, are, unstable, one, of, the, most, convenient, and, certainly, the, most, traditional, presentation, of, the, elements, is, in, the, form, of, the, periodic, table, which, groups, together, elements, with, similar, chemical, properties, and, usually, also, similar, electronic, structures, the, atomic, number, of, an, element, is, equal, to, the, number, of, protons, in, each, atom, and, defines, the, element, for, example, all, carbon, atoms, contain, 6, protons, in, their, atomic, nucleus, so, the, atomic, number, of, carbon, is, 6, carbon, atoms, may, have, different, numbers, of, neutrons, atoms, of, the, same, element, having, different, numbers, of, neutrons, are, known, as, isotopes, of, the, element, the, number, of, protons, in, the, nucleus, also, determines, its, electric, charge, which, in, turn, determines, the, number, of, electrons, of, the, atom, in, its, non, ionized, state, the, electrons, are, placed, into, atomic, orbitals, that, determine, the, atom, s, chemical, properties, the, number, of, neutrons, in, a, nucleus, usually, has, very, little, effect, on, an, element, s, chemical, properties, except, for, hydrogen, for, which, the, kinetic, isotope, effect, is, significant, thus, all, carbon, isotopes, have, nearly, identical, chemical, properties, because, they, all, have, six, electrons, even, though, they, may, have, 6, to, 8, neutrons, that, is, why, atomic, number, rather, than, mass, number, or, atomic, weight, is, considered, the, identifying, characteristic, of, an, element, the, symbol, for, atomic, number, is, z, isotopes, are, atoms, of, the, same, element, that, is, with, the, same, number, of, protons, in, their, nucleus, but, having, different, numbers, of, neutrons, thus, for, example, there, are, three, main, isotopes, of, carbon, all, carbon, atoms, have, 6, protons, but, they, can, have, either, 6, 7, or, 8, neutrons, since, the, mass, numbers, of, these, are, 12, 13, and, 14, respectively, said, three, isotopes, are, known, as, carbon, 12, carbon, 13, and, carbon, 14, 12, c, 13, c, and, 14, c, natural, carbon, is, a, mixture, of, 12, c, about, 98, 9, 13, c, about, 1, 1, and, about, 1, atom, per, trillion, of, 14, c, most, 66, of, 94, naturally, occurring, elements, have, more, than, one, stable, isotope, except, for, the, isotopes, of, hydrogen, which, differ, greatly, from, each, other, in, relative, mass, enough, to, cause, chemical, effects, the, isotopes, of, a, given, element, are, chemically, nearly, indistinguishable, all, elements, have, radioactive, isotopes, radioisotopes, most, of, these, radioisotopes, do, not, occur, naturally, radioisotopes, typically, decay, into, other, elements, via, alpha, decay, beta, decay, or, inverse, beta, decay, some, isotopes, of, the, heaviest, elements, also, undergo, spontaneous, fission, isotopes, that, are, not, radioactive, are, termed, stable, isotopes, all, known, stable, isotopes, occur, naturally, see, primordial, nuclide, the, many, radioisotopes, that, are, not, found, in, nature, have, been, characterized, after, being, artificially, produced, certain, elements, have, no, stable, isotopes, and, are, composed, only, of, radioisotopes, specifically, the, elements, without, any, stable, isotopes, are, technetium, atomic, number, 43, promethium, atomic, number, 61, and, all, observed, elements, with, atomic, number, greater, than, 82, of, the, 80, elements, with, at, least, one, stable, isotope, 26, have, only, one, stable, isotope, the, mean, number, of, stable, isotopes, for, the, 80, stable, elements, is, 3, 1, stable, isotopes, per, element, the, largest, number, of, stable, isotopes, for, a, single, element, is, 10, for, tin, element, 50, the, mass, number, of, an, element, a, is, the, number, of, nucleons, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, atomic, nucleus, different, isotopes, of, a, given, element, are, distinguished, by, their, mass, number, which, is, written, as, a, superscript, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, chemical, symbol, e, g, 238, u, the, mass, number, is, always, an, integer, and, has, units, of, nucleons, thus, magnesium, 24, 24, is, the, mass, number, is, an, atom, with, 24, nucleons, 12, protons, and, 12, neutrons, whereas, the, mass, number, simply, counts, the, total, number, of, neutrons, and, protons, and, is, thus, an, integer, the, atomic, mass, of, a, particular, isotope, or, nuclide, of, the, element, is, the, mass, of, a, single, atom, of, that, isotope, and, is, typically, expressed, in, daltons, symbol, da, or, universal, atomic, mass, units, symbol, u, its, relative, atomic, mass, is, a, dimensionless, number, equal, to, the, atomic, mass, divided, by, the, atomic, mass, constant, which, equals, 1, da, in, general, the, mass, number, of, a, given, nuclide, differs, in, value, slightly, from, its, relative, atomic, mass, since, the, mass, of, each, proton, and, neutron, is, not, exactly, 1, da, since, the, electrons, contribute, a, lesser, share, to, the, atomic, mass, as, neutron, number, exceeds, proton, number, and, because, of, the, nuclear, binding, energy, and, electron, binding, energy, for, example, the, atomic, mass, of, chlorine, 35, to, five, significant, digits, is, 34, 969, da, and, that, of, chlorine, 37, is, 36, 966, da, however, the, relative, atomic, mass, of, each, isotope, is, quite, close, to, its, mass, number, always, within, 1, the, only, isotope, whose, atomic, mass, is, exactly, a, natural, number, is, 12, c, which, has, a, mass, of, 12, da, because, the, dalton, is, defined, as, 1, 12, of, the, mass, of, a, free, neutral, carbon, 12, atom, in, the, ground, state, the, standard, atomic, weight, commonly, called, atomic, weight, of, an, element, is, the, average, of, the, atomic, masses, of, all, the, chemical, element, s, isotopes, as, found, in, a, particular, environment, weighted, by, isotopic, abundance, relative, to, the, atomic, mass, unit, this, number, may, be, a, fraction, that, is, not, close, to, a, whole, number, for, example, the, relative, atomic, mass, of, chlorine, is, 35, 453, u, which, differs, greatly, from, a, whole, number, as, it, is, an, average, of, about, 76, chlorine, 35, and, 24, chlorine, 37, whenever, a, relative, atomic, mass, value, differs, by, more, than, 1, from, a, whole, number, it, is, due, to, this, averaging, effect, as, significant, amounts, of, more, than, one, isotope, are, naturally, present, in, a, sample, of, that, element, chemists, and, nuclear, scientists, have, different, definitions, of, a, pure, element, in, chemistry, a, pure, element, means, a, substance, whose, atoms, all, or, in, practice, almost, all, have, the, same, atomic, number, or, number, of, protons, nuclear, scientists, however, define, a, pure, element, as, one, that, consists, of, only, one, isotope, for, example, a, copper, wire, is, 99, 99, chemically, pure, if, 99, 99, of, its, atoms, are, copper, with, 29, protons, each, however, it, is, not, isotopically, pure, since, ordinary, copper, consists, of, two, stable, isotopes, 69, 63, cu, and, 31, 65, cu, with, different, numbers, of, neutrons, however, pure, gold, would, be, both, chemically, and, isotopically, pure, since, ordinary, gold, consists, only, of, one, isotope, 197, au, atoms, of, chemically, pure, elements, may, bond, to, each, other, chemically, in, more, than, one, way, allowing, the, pure, element, to, exist, in, multiple, chemical, structures, spatial, arrangements, of, atoms, known, as, allotropes, which, differ, in, their, properties, for, example, carbon, can, be, found, as, diamond, which, has, a, tetrahedral, structure, around, each, carbon, atom, graphite, which, has, layers, of, carbon, atoms, with, a, hexagonal, structure, stacked, on, top, of, each, other, graphene, which, is, a, single, layer, of, graphite, that, is, very, strong, fullerenes, which, have, nearly, spherical, shapes, and, carbon, nanotubes, which, are, tubes, with, a, hexagonal, structure, even, these, may, differ, from, each, other, in, electrical, properties, the, ability, of, an, element, to, exist, in, one, of, many, structural, forms, is, known, as, allotropy, the, reference, state, of, an, element, is, defined, by, convention, usually, as, the, thermodynamically, most, stable, allotrope, and, physical, state, at, a, pressure, of, 1, bar, and, a, given, temperature, typically, at, 298, 15k, however, for, phosphorus, the, reference, state, is, white, phosphorus, even, though, it, is, not, the, most, stable, allotrope, and, the, reference, state, for, carbon, is, graphite, because, the, structure, of, graphite, is, more, stable, than, that, of, the, other, allotropes, in, thermochemistry, an, element, is, defined, to, have, an, enthalpy, of, formation, of, zero, in, its, reference, state, several, kinds, of, descriptive, categorizations, can, be, applied, broadly, to, the, elements, including, consideration, of, their, general, physical, and, chemical, properties, their, states, of, matter, under, familiar, conditions, their, melting, and, boiling, points, their, densities, their, crystal, structures, as, solids, and, their, origins, several, terms, are, commonly, used, to, characterize, the, general, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, the, chemical, elements, a, first, distinction, is, between, metals, which, readily, conduct, electricity, nonmetals, which, do, not, and, a, small, group, the, metalloids, having, intermediate, properties, and, often, behaving, as, semiconductors, a, more, refined, classification, is, often, shown, in, colored, presentations, of, the, periodic, table, this, system, restricts, the, terms, metal, and, nonmetal, to, only, certain, of, the, more, broadly, defined, metals, and, nonmetals, adding, additional, terms, for, certain, sets, of, the, more, broadly, viewed, metals, and, nonmetals, the, version, of, this, classification, used, in, the, periodic, tables, presented, here, includes, actinides, alkali, metals, alkaline, earth, metals, halogens, lanthanides, transition, metals, post, transition, metals, metalloids, reactive, nonmetals, and, noble, gases, in, this, system, the, alkali, metals, alkaline, earth, metals, and, transition, metals, as, well, as, the, lanthanides, and, the, actinides, are, special, groups, of, the, metals, viewed, in, a, broader, sense, similarly, the, reactive, nonmetals, and, the, noble, gases, are, nonmetals, viewed, in, the, broader, sense, in, some, presentations, the, halogens, are, not, distinguished, with, astatine, identified, as, a, metalloid, and, the, others, identified, as, nonmetals, another, commonly, used, basic, distinction, among, the, elements, is, their, state, of, matter, phase, whether, solid, liquid, or, gas, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, stp, most, elements, are, solids, at, stp, while, several, are, gases, only, bromine, and, mercury, are, liquid, at, 0, degrees, celsius, 32, degrees, fahrenheit, and, 1, atmosphere, pressure, caesium, and, gallium, are, solid, at, that, temperature, but, melt, at, 28, 4, c, 83, 2, f, and, 29, 8, c, 85, 6, f, respectively, melting, and, boiling, points, typically, expressed, in, degrees, celsius, at, a, pressure, of, one, atmosphere, are, commonly, used, in, characterizing, the, various, elements, while, known, for, most, elements, either, or, both, of, these, measurements, is, still, undetermined, for, some, of, the, radioactive, elements, available, in, only, tiny, quantities, since, helium, remains, a, liquid, even, at, absolute, zero, at, atmospheric, pressure, it, has, only, a, boiling, point, and, not, a, melting, point, in, conventional, presentations, the, density, at, selected, standard, temperature, and, pressure, stp, is, often, used, in, characterizing, the, elements, density, is, often, expressed, in, grams, per, cubic, centimetre, g, cm, 3, since, several, elements, are, gases, at, commonly, encountered, temperatures, their, densities, are, usually, stated, for, their, gaseous, forms, when, liquefied, or, solidified, the, gaseous, elements, have, densities, similar, to, those, of, the, other, elements, when, an, element, has, allotropes, with, different, densities, one, representative, allotrope, is, typically, selected, in, summary, presentations, while, densities, for, each, allotrope, can, be, stated, where, more, detail, is, provided, for, example, the, three, familiar, allotropes, of, carbon, amorphous, carbon, graphite, and, diamond, have, densities, of, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 267, and, 3, 515, g, cm, 3, respectively, the, elements, studied, to, date, as, solid, samples, have, eight, kinds, of, crystal, structures, cubic, body, centered, cubic, face, centered, cubic, hexagonal, monoclinic, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, and, tetragonal, for, some, of, the, synthetically, produced, transuranic, elements, available, samples, have, been, too, small, to, determine, crystal, structures, chemical, elements, may, also, be, categorized, by, their, origin, on, earth, with, the, first, 94, considered, naturally, occurring, while, those, with, atomic, numbers, beyond, 94, have, only, been, produced, artificially, via, human, made, nuclear, reactions, of, the, 94, naturally, occurring, elements, 83, are, considered, primordial, and, either, stable, or, weakly, radioactive, the, longest, lived, isotopes, of, the, remaining, 11, elements, have, half, lives, too, short, for, them, to, have, been, present, at, the, beginning, of, the, solar, system, and, are, therefore, considered, transient, elements, of, these, 11, transient, elements, five, polonium, radon, radium, actinium, and, protactinium, are, relatively, common, decay, products, of, thorium, and, uranium, the, remaining, six, transient, elements, technetium, promethium, astatine, francium, neptunium, and, plutonium, occur, only, rarely, as, products, of, rare, decay, modes, or, nuclear, reaction, processes, involving, uranium, or, other, heavy, elements, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 1, through, 82, except, 43, technetium, and, 61, promethium, each, have, at, least, one, isotope, for, which, no, radioactive, decay, has, been, observed, observationally, stable, isotopes, of, some, elements, such, as, tungsten, and, lead, however, are, predicted, to, be, slightly, radioactive, with, very, long, half, lives, for, example, the, half, lives, predicted, for, the, observationally, stable, lead, isotopes, range, from, 10, 35, to, 10, 189, years, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 43, 61, and, 83, through, 94, are, unstable, enough, that, their, radioactive, decay, can, be, detected, three, of, these, elements, bismuth, element, 83, thorium, 90, and, uranium, 92, have, one, or, more, isotopes, with, half, lives, long, enough, to, survive, as, remnants, of, the, explosive, stellar, nucleosynthesis, that, produced, the, heavy, elements, before, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, for, example, at, over, 1, 9, 10, 19, years, over, a, billion, times, longer, than, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, bismuth, 209, has, the, longest, known, alpha, decay, half, life, of, any, isotope, the, last, 24, elements, those, beyond, plutonium, element, 94, undergo, radioactive, decay, with, short, half, lives, and, cannot, be, produced, as, daughters, of, longer, lived, elements, and, thus, are, not, known, to, occur, in, nature, at, all, 1, the, properties, of, the, elements, are, often, summarized, using, the, periodic, table, which, powerfully, and, elegantly, organizes, the, elements, by, increasing, atomic, number, into, rows, periods, in, which, the, columns, groups, share, recurring, periodic, physical, and, chemical, properties, the, table, contains, 118, confirmed, elements, as, of, 2021, although, earlier, precursors, to, this, presentation, exist, its, invention, is, generally, credited, to, russian, chemist, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1869, who, intended, the, table, to, illustrate, recurring, trends, in, the, properties, of, the, elements, the, layout, of, the, table, has, been, refined, and, extended, over, time, as, new, elements, have, been, discovered, and, new, theoretical, models, have, been, developed, to, explain, chemical, behavior, use, of, the, periodic, table, is, now, ubiquitous, in, chemistry, providing, an, extremely, useful, framework, to, classify, systematize, and, compare, all, the, many, different, forms, of, chemical, behavior, the, table, has, also, found, wide, application, in, physics, geology, biology, materials, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, nutrition, environmental, health, and, astronomy, its, principles, are, especially, important, in, chemical, engineering, the, various, chemical, elements, are, formally, identified, by, their, unique, atomic, numbers, their, accepted, names, and, their, chemical, symbols, the, known, elements, have, atomic, numbers, from, 1, to, 118, conventionally, presented, as, arabic, numerals, since, the, elements, can, be, uniquely, sequenced, by, atomic, number, conventionally, from, lowest, to, highest, as, in, a, periodic, table, sets, of, elements, are, sometimes, specified, by, such, notation, as, through, beyond, or, from, through, as, in, through, iron, beyond, uranium, or, from, lanthanum, through, lutetium, the, terms, light, and, heavy, are, sometimes, also, used, informally, to, indicate, relative, atomic, numbers, not, densities, as, in, lighter, than, carbon, or, heavier, than, lead, though, the, atomic, masses, of, the, elements, their, atomic, weights, or, atomic, masses, do, not, always, increase, monotonically, with, their, atomic, numbers, the, naming, of, various, substances, now, known, as, elements, precedes, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, as, names, were, given, locally, by, various, cultures, to, various, minerals, metals, compounds, alloys, mixtures, and, other, materials, though, at, the, time, it, was, not, known, which, chemicals, were, elements, and, which, compounds, as, they, were, identified, as, elements, the, existing, names, for, anciently, known, elements, e, g, gold, mercury, iron, were, kept, in, most, countries, national, differences, emerged, over, the, element, names, either, for, convenience, linguistic, niceties, or, nationalism, for, example, german, speakers, use, wasserstoff, water, substance, for, hydrogen, sauerstoff, acid, substance, for, oxygen, and, stickstoff, smothering, substance, for, nitrogen, english, and, some, other, languages, use, sodium, for, natrium, and, potassium, for, kalium, and, the, french, italians, greeks, portuguese, and, poles, prefer, azote, azot, azoto, from, roots, meaning, no, life, for, nitrogen, for, purposes, of, international, communication, and, trade, the, official, names, of, the, chemical, elements, both, ancient, and, more, recently, recognized, are, decided, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, which, has, decided, on, a, sort, of, international, english, language, drawing, on, traditional, english, names, even, when, an, element, s, chemical, symbol, is, based, on, a, latin, or, other, traditional, word, for, example, adopting, gold, rather, than, aurum, as, the, name, for, the, 79th, element, au, iupac, prefers, the, british, spellings, aluminium, and, caesium, over, the, u, s, spellings, aluminum, and, cesium, and, the, u, s, sulfur, over, british, sulphur, however, elements, that, are, practical, to, sell, in, bulk, in, many, countries, often, still, have, locally, used, national, names, and, countries, whose, national, language, does, not, use, the, latin, alphabet, are, likely, to, use, the, iupac, element, names, according, to, iupac, element, names, are, not, proper, nouns, therefore, the, full, name, of, an, element, is, not, capitalized, in, english, even, if, derived, from, a, proper, noun, as, in, californium, and, einsteinium, isotope, names, are, also, uncapitalized, if, written, out, e, g, carbon, 12, or, uranium, 235, chemical, element, symbols, such, as, cf, for, californium, and, es, for, einsteinium, are, always, capitalized, see, below, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, physics, laboratories, became, able, to, produce, elements, with, half, lives, too, short, for, an, appreciable, amount, of, them, to, exist, at, any, time, these, are, also, named, by, iupac, which, generally, adopts, the, name, chosen, by, the, discoverer, this, practice, can, lead, to, the, controversial, question, of, which, research, group, actually, discovered, an, element, a, question, that, delayed, the, naming, of, elements, with, atomic, number, of, 104, and, higher, for, a, considerable, amount, of, time, see, element, naming, controversy, precursors, of, such, controversies, involved, the, nationalistic, namings, of, elements, in, the, late, 19th, century, for, example, lutetium, was, named, in, reference, to, paris, france, the, germans, were, reluctant, to, relinquish, naming, rights, to, the, french, often, calling, it, cassiopeium, similarly, the, british, discoverer, of, niobium, originally, named, it, columbium, in, reference, to, the, new, world, it, was, used, extensively, as, such, by, american, publications, before, the, international, standardization, in, 1950, before, chemistry, became, a, science, alchemists, designed, arcane, symbols, for, both, metals, and, common, compounds, these, were, however, used, as, abbreviations, in, diagrams, or, procedures, there, was, no, concept, of, atoms, combining, to, form, molecules, with, his, advances, in, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, john, dalton, devised, his, own, simpler, symbols, based, on, circles, to, depict, molecules, the, current, system, of, chemical, notation, was, invented, by, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, in, 1814, in, this, system, chemical, symbols, are, not, mere, abbreviations, though, each, consists, of, letters, of, the, latin, alphabet, they, are, intended, as, universal, symbols, for, people, of, all, languages, and, alphabets, since, latin, was, the, common, language, of, science, at, berzelius, time, his, symbols, were, abbreviations, based, on, the, latin, names, of, elements, they, may, be, classical, latin, names, of, elements, known, since, antiquity, or, neo, latin, coinages, for, later, elements, the, symbols, are, not, followed, by, a, period, full, stop, as, with, abbreviations, in, most, cases, latin, names, of, elements, as, used, by, berzelius, have, the, same, roots, as, the, modern, english, name, for, example, hydrogen, has, the, symbol, h, from, neo, latin, hydrogenium, which, has, the, same, greek, roots, as, english, hydrogen, however, in, eleven, cases, latin, as, used, by, berzelius, and, english, names, of, elements, have, different, roots, eight, of, them, are, the, seven, metals, of, antiquity, and, a, metalloid, also, known, since, antiquity, fe, latin, ferrum, for, iron, hg, latin, hydrargyrum, for, mercury, sn, latin, stannum, for, tin, au, latin, aurum, for, gold, ag, latin, argentum, for, silver, pb, latin, plumbum, for, lead, cu, latin, cuprum, for, copper, and, sb, latin, stibium, for, antimony, the, three, other, mismatches, between, neo, latin, as, used, by, berzelius, and, english, names, are, na, neo, latin, natrium, for, sodium, k, neo, latin, kalium, for, potassium, and, w, neo, latin, wolframium, for, tungsten, these, mismatches, came, from, different, suggestings, of, naming, the, elements, in, the, modern, era, initially, berzelius, had, suggested, so, and, po, for, sodium, and, potassium, but, he, changed, the, symbols, to, na, and, k, later, in, the, same, year, elements, discovered, after, 1814, were, also, assigned, unique, chemical, symbols, based, on, the, name, of, the, element, the, use, of, latin, as, the, universal, language, of, science, was, fading, but, chemical, names, of, newly, discovered, elements, came, to, be, borrowed, from, language, to, language, with, little, or, no, modifications, symbols, of, elements, discovered, after, 1814, match, their, names, in, english, french, ignoring, the, acute, accent, on, and, german, though, german, often, allows, alternate, spellings, with, k, or, z, instead, of, c, e, g, the, name, of, calcium, may, be, spelled, calcium, or, kalzium, in, german, but, its, symbol, is, always, ca, other, languages, sometimes, modify, element, name, spellings, spanish, iterbio, ytterbium, italian, afnio, hafnium, swedish, moskovium, moscovium, but, those, modifications, do, not, affect, chemical, symbols, yb, hf, mc, chemical, symbols, are, understood, internationally, when, element, names, might, require, translation, there, have, been, some, differences, in, the, past, for, example, germans, in, the, past, have, used, j, for, the, name, jod, for, iodine, but, now, use, i, and, iod, the, first, letter, of, a, chemical, symbol, is, always, capitalized, as, in, the, preceding, examples, and, the, subsequent, letters, if, any, are, always, lower, case, thus, the, symbols, for, californium, and, einsteinium, are, cf, and, es, there, are, also, symbols, in, chemical, equations, for, groups, of, elements, for, example, in, comparative, formulas, these, are, often, a, single, capital, letter, and, the, letters, are, reserved, and, not, used, for, names, of, specific, elements, for, example, x, indicates, a, variable, group, usually, a, halogen, in, a, class, of, compounds, while, r, is, a, radical, meaning, a, compound, structure, such, as, a, hydrocarbon, chain, the, letter, q, is, reserved, for, heat, in, a, chemical, reaction, y, is, also, often, used, as, a, general, chemical, symbol, though, it, is, also, the, symbol, of, yttrium, z, is, also, often, used, as, a, general, variable, group, e, is, used, in, organic, chemistry, to, denote, an, electron, withdrawing, group, or, an, electrophile, similarly, nu, denotes, a, nucleophile, l, is, used, to, represent, a, general, ligand, in, inorganic, and, organometallic, chemistry, m, is, also, often, used, in, place, of, a, general, metal, at, least, two, other, two, letter, generic, chemical, symbols, are, also, in, informal, use, ln, for, any, lanthanide, and, an, for, any, actinide, rg, was, formerly, used, for, any, rare, gas, element, but, the, group, of, rare, gases, has, now, been, renamed, noble, gases, and, rg, now, refers, to, roentgenium, isotopes, of, an, element, are, distinguished, by, mass, number, total, protons, and, neutrons, with, this, number, combined, with, the, element, s, symbol, iupac, prefers, that, isotope, symbols, be, written, in, superscript, notation, when, practical, for, example, 12, c, and, 235, u, however, other, notations, such, as, carbon, 12, and, uranium, 235, or, c, 12, and, u, 235, are, also, used, as, a, special, case, the, three, naturally, occurring, isotopes, of, hydrogen, are, often, specified, as, h, for, 1, h, protium, d, for, 2, h, deuterium, and, t, for, 3, h, tritium, this, convention, is, easier, to, use, in, chemical, equations, replacing, the, need, to, write, out, the, mass, number, each, time, thus, the, formula, for, heavy, water, may, be, written, d, 2, o, instead, of, 2, h, 2, o, only, about, 4, of, the, total, mass, of, the, universe, is, made, of, atoms, or, ions, and, thus, represented, by, elements, this, fraction, is, about, 15, of, the, total, matter, with, the, remainder, of, the, matter, 85, being, dark, matter, the, nature, of, dark, matter, is, unknown, but, it, is, not, composed, of, atoms, of, elements, because, it, contains, no, protons, neutrons, or, electrons, the, remaining, non, matter, part, of, the, mass, of, the, universe, is, composed, of, the, even, less, well, understood, dark, energy, the, 94, naturally, occurring, elements, were, produced, by, at, least, four, classes, of, astrophysical, process, most, of, the, hydrogen, helium, and, a, very, small, quantity, of, lithium, were, produced, in, the, first, few, minutes, of, the, big, bang, this, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, happened, only, once, the, other, processes, are, ongoing, nuclear, fusion, inside, stars, produces, elements, through, stellar, nucleosynthesis, including, all, elements, from, carbon, to, iron, in, atomic, number, elements, higher, in, atomic, number, than, iron, including, heavy, elements, like, uranium, and, plutonium, are, produced, by, various, forms, of, explosive, nucleosynthesis, in, supernovae, and, neutron, star, mergers, the, light, elements, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, are, produced, mostly, through, cosmic, ray, spallation, fragmentation, induced, by, cosmic, rays, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, in, the, early, phases, of, the, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, of, hydrogen, resulted, in, the, production, of, hydrogen, 1, protium, 1, h, and, helium, 4, 4, he, as, well, as, a, smaller, amount, of, deuterium, 2, h, and, tiny, amounts, on, the, order, of, 10, 10, of, lithium, and, beryllium, even, smaller, amounts, of, boron, may, have, been, produced, in, the, big, bang, since, it, has, been, observed, in, some, very, old, stars, while, carbon, has, not, no, elements, heavier, than, boron, were, produced, in, the, big, bang, as, a, result, the, primordial, abundance, of, atoms, or, ions, consisted, of, 75, 1, h, 25, 4, he, and, 0, 01, deuterium, with, only, tiny, traces, of, lithium, beryllium, and, perhaps, boron, subsequent, enrichment, of, galactic, halos, occurred, due, to, stellar, nucleosynthesis, and, supernova, nucleosynthesis, however, the, element, abundance, in, intergalactic, space, can, still, closely, resemble, primordial, conditions, unless, it, has, been, enriched, by, some, means, on, earth, and, elsewhere, trace, amounts, of, various, elements, continue, to, be, produced, from, other, elements, as, products, of, nuclear, transmutation, processes, these, include, some, produced, by, cosmic, rays, or, other, nuclear, reactions, see, cosmogenic, and, nucleogenic, nuclides, and, others, produced, as, decay, products, of, long, lived, primordial, nuclides, for, example, trace, but, detectable, amounts, of, carbon, 14, 14, c, are, continually, produced, in, the, air, by, cosmic, rays, impacting, nitrogen, atoms, and, argon, 40, 40, ar, is, continually, produced, by, the, decay, of, primordially, occurring, but, unstable, potassium, 40, 40, k, also, three, primordially, occurring, but, radioactive, actinides, thorium, uranium, and, plutonium, decay, through, a, series, of, recurrently, produced, but, unstable, elements, such, as, radium, and, radon, which, are, transiently, present, in, any, sample, of, containing, these, metals, three, other, radioactive, elements, technetium, promethium, and, neptunium, occur, only, incidentally, in, natural, materials, produced, as, individual, atoms, by, nuclear, fission, of, the, nuclei, of, various, heavy, elements, or, in, other, rare, nuclear, processes, besides, the, 94, naturally, occurring, elements, several, artificial, elements, have, been, produced, by, nuclear, physics, technology, by, 2016, these, experiments, had, produced, all, elements, up, to, atomic, number, 118, the, following, graph, note, log, scale, shows, the, abundance, of, elements, in, our, solar, system, the, table, shows, the, 12, most, common, elements, in, our, galaxy, estimated, spectroscopically, as, measured, in, parts, per, million, by, mass, nearby, galaxies, that, have, evolved, along, similar, lines, have, a, corresponding, enrichment, of, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, the, more, distant, galaxies, are, being, viewed, as, they, appeared, in, the, past, so, their, abundances, of, elements, appear, closer, to, the, primordial, mixture, as, physical, laws, and, processes, appear, common, throughout, the, visible, universe, however, scientists, expect, that, these, galaxies, evolved, elements, in, similar, abundance, the, abundance, of, elements, in, the, solar, system, is, in, keeping, with, their, origin, from, nucleosynthesis, in, the, big, bang, and, a, number, of, progenitor, supernova, stars, very, abundant, hydrogen, and, helium, are, products, of, the, big, bang, but, the, next, three, elements, are, rare, since, they, had, little, time, to, form, in, the, big, bang, and, are, not, made, in, stars, they, are, however, produced, in, small, quantities, by, the, breakup, of, heavier, elements, in, interstellar, dust, as, a, result, of, impact, by, cosmic, rays, beginning, with, carbon, elements, are, produced, in, stars, by, buildup, from, alpha, particles, helium, nuclei, resulting, in, an, alternatingly, larger, abundance, of, elements, with, even, atomic, numbers, these, are, also, more, stable, in, general, such, elements, up, to, iron, are, made, in, large, stars, in, the, process, of, becoming, supernovas, iron, 56, is, particularly, common, since, it, is, the, most, stable, nuclide, that, can, easily, be, made, from, alpha, particles, being, a, product, of, decay, of, radioactive, nickel, 56, ultimately, made, from, 14, helium, nuclei, elements, heavier, than, iron, are, made, in, energy, absorbing, processes, in, large, stars, and, their, abundance, in, the, universe, and, on, earth, generally, decreases, with, their, atomic, number, the, abundance, of, the, chemical, elements, on, earth, varies, from, air, to, crust, to, ocean, and, in, various, types, of, life, the, abundance, of, elements, in, earth, s, crust, differs, from, that, in, the, solar, system, as, seen, in, the, sun, and, massive, planets, like, jupiter, mainly, in, selective, loss, of, the, very, lightest, elements, hydrogen, and, helium, and, also, volatile, neon, carbon, as, hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and, sulfur, as, a, result, of, solar, heating, in, the, early, formation, of, the, solar, system, oxygen, the, most, abundant, earth, element, by, mass, is, retained, on, earth, by, combination, with, silicon, aluminium, at, 8, by, mass, is, more, common, in, the, earth, s, crust, than, in, the, universe, and, solar, system, but, the, composition, of, the, far, more, bulky, mantle, which, has, magnesium, and, iron, in, place, of, aluminium, which, occurs, there, only, at, 2, of, mass, more, closely, mirrors, the, elemental, composition, of, the, solar, system, save, for, the, noted, loss, of, volatile, elements, to, space, and, loss, of, iron, which, has, migrated, to, the, earth, s, core, the, composition, of, the, human, body, by, contrast, more, closely, follows, the, composition, of, seawater, save, that, the, human, body, has, additional, stores, of, carbon, and, nitrogen, necessary, to, form, the, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, together, with, phosphorus, in, the, nucleic, acids, and, energy, transfer, molecule, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, that, occurs, in, the, cells, of, all, living, organisms, certain, kinds, of, organisms, require, particular, additional, elements, for, example, the, magnesium, in, chlorophyll, in, green, plants, the, calcium, in, mollusc, shells, or, the, iron, in, the, hemoglobin, in, vertebrates, red, blood, cells, the, concept, of, an, element, as, an, indivisible, substance, has, developed, through, three, major, historical, phases, classical, definitions, such, as, those, of, the, ancient, greeks, chemical, definitions, and, atomic, definitions, ancient, philosophy, posited, a, set, of, classical, elements, to, explain, observed, patterns, in, nature, these, elements, originally, referred, to, earth, water, air, and, fire, rather, than, the, chemical, elements, of, modern, science, the, term, elements, stoicheia, was, first, used, by, greek, philosopher, plato, around, 360, bce, in, his, dialogue, timaeus, which, includes, a, discussion, of, the, composition, of, inorganic, and, organic, bodies, and, is, a, speculative, treatise, on, chemistry, plato, believed, the, elements, introduced, a, century, earlier, by, empedocles, were, composed, of, small, polyhedral, forms, tetrahedron, fire, octahedron, air, icosahedron, water, and, cube, earth, aristotle, c, 350, bce, also, used, the, term, stoicheia, and, added, a, fifth, element, aether, which, formed, the, heavens, aristotle, defined, an, element, as, element, one, of, those, bodies, into, which, other, bodies, can, decompose, and, that, itself, is, not, capable, of, being, divided, into, other, in, 1661, in, the, sceptical, chymist, robert, boyle, proposed, his, theory, of, corpuscularism, which, favoured, the, analysis, of, matter, as, constituted, of, irreducible, units, of, matter, atoms, and, choosing, to, side, with, neither, aristotle, s, view, of, the, four, elements, nor, paracelsus, view, of, three, fundamental, elements, left, open, the, question, of, the, number, of, elements, boyle, argued, against, a, pre, determined, number, of, elements, directly, against, paracelsus, three, principles, sulfur, mercury, and, salt, indirectly, against, the, aristotelian, elements, earth, water, air, and, fire, for, boyle, felt, that, the, arguments, against, the, former, were, at, least, as, valid, against, the, latter, much, of, what, i, am, to, deliver, may, be, indifferently, apply, d, to, the, four, peripatetick, elements, and, the, three, chymical, principles, the, chymical, hypothesis, seeming, to, be, much, more, countenanc, d, by, experience, then, the, other, it, will, be, expedient, to, insist, chiefly, upon, the, disproving, of, that, especially, since, most, of, the, arguments, that, are, imploy, d, against, it, may, by, a, little, variation, be, made, at, least, as, strongly, against, the, less, plausible, aristotelian, doctrine, then, boyle, stated, his, view, in, four, propositions, in, the, first, and, second, he, suggests, that, matter, consists, of, particles, but, that, these, particles, may, be, difficult, to, separate, boyle, used, the, concept, of, corpuscles, or, atomes, as, he, also, called, them, to, explain, how, a, limited, number, of, elements, could, combine, into, a, vast, number, of, compounds, propos, i, at, the, first, production, of, mixt, bodies, the, universal, matter, whereof, they, consisted, was, actually, divided, into, little, particles, the, generation, and, wasting, of, bodies, and, the, chymical, resolutions, of, mixt, bodies, and, operations, of, fires, upon, them, manifest, their, consisting, of, parts, very, minute, epicurus, as, you, well, know, supposes, all, bodies, to, be, produc, d, by, atomes, moving, themselves, to, and, fro, in, the, infinite, vacuum, propos, ii, these, minute, particles, were, associated, into, minute, clusters, not, easily, dissipable, into, such, particles, as, compos, d, them, if, we, assigne, to, the, corpuscles, whereof, each, element, consists, a, peculiar, size, and, shape, such, corpuscles, may, be, mingled, in, such, various, proportions, and, connected, so, many, wayes, that, an, almost, incredible, number, of, concretes, may, be, compos, d, of, them, boyle, explained, that, gold, reacts, with, aqua, regia, and, mercury, with, nitric, acid, sulfuric, acid, and, sulfur, to, produce, various, compounds, and, that, they, could, be, recovered, from, those, compounds, just, as, would, be, expected, of, elements, yet, boyle, did, not, consider, gold, mercury, or, lead, elements, but, rather, together, with, wine, perfectly, mixt, bodies, quicksilver, with, aqua, fortis, will, be, brought, into, a, white, powder, with, sulphur, it, will, compose, a, blood, red, cinaber, and, yet, out, of, all, these, exotick, compounds, we, may, recover, the, very, same, running, mercury, propos, iii, from, most, of, such, mixt, bodies, there, may, by, the, help, of, the, fire, be, actually, obtain, d, a, determinate, number, whether, three, four, or, five, or, fewer, or, more, of, substances, the, chymists, are, wont, to, call, the, ingredients, of, mixt, bodies, principles, as, the, aristotelians, name, them, elements, principles, as, not, being, compounded, of, any, more, primary, bodies, and, elements, in, regard, that, all, mix, d, bodies, are, compounded, of, them, even, though, boyle, is, primarily, regarded, as, the, first, modern, chemist, the, sceptical, chymist, still, contains, old, ideas, about, the, elements, alien, to, a, contemporary, viewpoint, sulfur, for, example, is, not, only, the, familiar, yellow, non, metal, but, also, an, inflammable, spirit, in, 1724, in, his, book, logick, the, english, minister, and, logician, isaac, watts, enumerated, the, elements, then, recognized, by, chemists, watts, list, of, elements, included, two, of, paracelsus, principles, sulfur, and, salt, and, two, classical, elements, earth, and, water, as, well, as, spirit, watts, did, however, note, a, lack, of, consensus, among, chemists, elements, are, such, substances, as, cannot, be, resolved, or, reduced, into, two, or, more, substances, of, different, kinds, followers, of, aristotle, made, fire, air, earth, and, water, to, be, the, four, elements, of, which, all, earthly, things, were, compounded, and, they, suppos, d, the, heavens, to, be, a, quintessence, or, fifth, sort, of, body, distinct, from, all, these, but, since, experimental, philosophy, have, been, better, understood, this, doctrine, has, been, abundantly, refuted, the, chymists, make, spirit, salt, sulphur, water, and, earth, to, be, their, five, elements, because, they, can, reduce, all, terrestrial, things, to, these, five, tho, they, are, not, all, agreed, the, first, modern, list, of, elements, was, given, in, antoine, lavoisier, s, 1789, elements, of, chemistry, which, contained, 33, elements, including, light, and, caloric, by, 1818, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, had, determined, atomic, weights, for, 45, of, the, 49, then, accepted, elements, dmitri, mendeleev, had, 63, elements, in, his, 1869, periodic, table, from, boyle, until, the, early, 20th, century, an, element, was, defined, as, a, pure, substance, that, cannot, be, decomposed, into, any, simpler, substance, and, cannot, be, transformed, into, other, elements, by, chemical, processes, elements, at, the, time, were, generally, distinguished, by, their, atomic, weights, a, property, measurable, with, fair, accuracy, by, available, analytical, techniques, the, 1913, discovery, by, english, physicist, henry, moseley, that, the, nuclear, charge, is, the, physical, basis, for, the, atomic, number, further, refined, when, the, nature, of, protons, and, neutrons, became, appreciated, eventually, led, to, the, current, definition, of, an, element, based, on, atomic, number, number, of, protons, the, use, of, atomic, numbers, rather, than, atomic, weights, to, distinguish, elements, has, greater, predictive, value, since, these, numbers, are, integers, and, also, resolves, some, ambiguities, in, the, chemistry, based, view, due, to, varying, properties, of, isotopes, and, allotropes, within, the, same, element, currently, iupac, defines, an, element, to, exist, if, it, has, isotopes, with, a, lifetime, longer, than, the, 10, 14, seconds, it, takes, the, nucleus, to, form, an, electronic, cloud, by, 1914, eighty, seven, elements, were, known, all, naturally, occurring, see, discovery, of, chemical, elements, the, remaining, naturally, occurring, elements, were, discovered, or, isolated, in, subsequent, decades, and, various, additional, elements, have, also, been, produced, synthetically, with, much, of, that, work, pioneered, by, glenn, t, seaborg, in, 1955, element, 101, was, discovered, and, named, mendelevium, in, honor, of, d, i, mendeleev, the, first, to, arrange, the, elements, periodically, ten, materials, familiar, to, various, prehistoric, cultures, are, now, known, to, be, elements, carbon, copper, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, sulfur, tin, and, zinc, three, additional, materials, now, accepted, as, elements, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, were, recognized, as, distinct, substances, before, 1500, ad, phosphorus, cobalt, and, platinum, were, isolated, before, 1750, most, of,
