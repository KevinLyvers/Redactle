in, physics, specifically, in, electromagnetism, the, lorentz, force, law, is, the, combination, of, electric, and, magnetic, force, on, a, point, charge, due, to, electromagnetic, fields, the, lorentz, force, on, the, other, hand, is, a, physical, effect, that, occurs, in, the, vicinity, of, electrically, neutral, current, carrying, conductors, causing, moving, electrical, charges, to, experience, a, magnetic, force, the, lorentz, force, law, states, that, a, particle, of, charge, q, moving, with, a, velocity, v, in, an, electric, field, e, and, a, magnetic, field, b, experiences, a, force, in, si, units, of, f, q, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, left, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, right, it, says, that, the, electromagnetic, force, on, a, charge, q, is, a, combination, of, 1, a, force, in, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, e, proportional, to, the, magnitude, of, the, field, and, the, quantity, of, charge, and, 2, a, force, at, right, angles, to, both, the, magnetic, field, b, and, the, velocity, v, of, the, charge, proportional, to, the, magnitude, of, the, field, the, charge, and, the, velocity, variations, on, this, basic, formula, describe, the, magnetic, force, on, a, current, carrying, wire, sometimes, called, laplace, force, the, electromotive, force, in, a, wire, loop, moving, through, a, magnetic, field, an, aspect, of, faraday, s, law, of, induction, and, the, force, on, a, moving, charged, particle, historians, suggest, that, the, law, is, implicit, in, a, paper, by, james, clerk, maxwell, published, in, 1865, hendrik, lorentz, arrived, at, a, complete, derivation, in, 1895, identifying, the, contribution, of, the, electric, force, a, few, years, after, oliver, heaviside, correctly, identified, the, contribution, of, the, magnetic, force, in, many, textbook, treatments, of, classical, electromagnetism, the, lorentz, force, law, is, used, as, the, definition, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, e, and, b, to, be, specific, the, lorentz, force, is, understood, to, be, the, following, empirical, statement, the, electromagnetic, force, f, on, a, test, charge, at, a, given, point, and, time, is, a, certain, function, of, its, charge, q, and, velocity, v, which, can, be, parameterized, by, exactly, two, vectors, e, and, b, in, the, functional, form, f, q, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, this, is, valid, even, for, particles, approaching, the, speed, of, light, that, is, magnitude, of, v, v, c, so, the, two, vector, fields, e, and, b, are, thereby, defined, throughout, space, and, time, and, these, are, called, the, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, the, fields, are, defined, everywhere, in, space, and, time, with, respect, to, what, force, a, test, charge, would, receive, regardless, of, whether, a, charge, is, present, to, experience, the, force, as, a, definition, of, e, and, b, the, lorentz, force, is, only, a, definition, in, principle, because, a, real, particle, as, opposed, to, the, hypothetical, test, charge, of, infinitesimally, small, mass, and, charge, would, generate, its, own, finite, e, and, b, fields, which, would, alter, the, electromagnetic, force, that, it, experiences, in, addition, if, the, charge, experiences, acceleration, as, if, forced, into, a, curved, trajectory, it, emits, radiation, that, causes, it, to, lose, kinetic, energy, see, for, example, bremsstrahlung, and, synchrotron, light, these, effects, occur, through, both, a, direct, effect, called, the, radiation, reaction, force, and, indirectly, by, affecting, the, motion, of, nearby, charges, and, currents, coulomb, s, law, is, only, valid, for, point, charges, at, rest, in, fact, the, electromagnetic, force, between, two, point, charges, depends, not, only, on, the, distance, but, also, on, the, relative, velocity, for, small, relative, velocities, and, very, small, accelerations, instead, of, the, coulomb, force, the, weber, force, can, be, applied, the, sum, of, the, weber, forces, of, all, charge, carriers, in, a, closed, dc, loop, on, a, single, test, charge, produces, regardless, of, the, shape, of, the, current, loop, the, lorentz, force, the, interpretation, of, magnetism, by, means, of, a, modified, coulomb, law, was, first, proposed, by, carl, friedrich, gauss, in, 1835, gauss, assumed, that, each, segment, of, a, dc, loop, contains, an, equal, number, of, negative, and, positive, point, charges, that, move, at, different, speeds, if, coulomb, s, law, were, completely, correct, no, force, should, act, between, any, two, short, segments, of, such, current, loops, however, around, 1825, andr, marie, amp, re, demonstrated, experimentally, that, this, is, not, the, case, amp, re, also, formulated, a, force, law, based, on, this, law, gauss, concluded, that, the, electromagnetic, force, between, two, point, charges, depends, not, only, on, the, distance, but, also, on, the, relative, velocity, the, weber, force, is, a, central, force, and, complies, with, newton, s, third, law, this, demonstrates, not, only, the, conservation, of, momentum, but, also, that, the, conservation, of, energy, and, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, apply, weber, electrodynamics, is, only, a, quasistatic, approximation, i, e, it, should, not, be, used, for, higher, velocities, and, accelerations, however, the, weber, force, illustrates, that, the, lorentz, force, can, be, traced, back, to, central, forces, between, numerous, point, like, charge, carriers, the, force, f, acting, on, a, particle, of, electric, charge, q, with, instantaneous, velocity, v, due, to, an, external, electric, field, e, and, magnetic, field, b, is, given, by, si, definition, of, quantities, f, q, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, left, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, right, where, is, the, vector, cross, product, all, boldface, quantities, are, vectors, in, terms, of, cartesian, components, we, have, f, x, q, e, x, v, y, b, z, v, z, b, y, f, y, q, e, y, v, z, b, x, v, x, b, z, f, z, q, e, z, v, x, b, y, v, y, b, x, displaystyle, begin,

electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, functions, of, the, position, and, time, therefore, explicitly, the, lorentz, force, can, be, written, as, f, r, t, r, t, t, q, q, e, r, t, r, t, b, r, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, left, mathbf, r, t, dot, mathbf, r, t, t, q, right, q, left, in, which, r, is, the, position, vector, of, the, charged, particle, t, is, time, and, the, overdot, is, a, time, derivative, a, positively, charged, particle, will, be, accelerated, in, the, same, linear, orientation, as, the, e, field, but, will, curve, perpendicularly, to, both, the, instantaneous, velocity, vector, v, and, the, b, field, according, to, the, right, hand, rule, in, detail, if, the, fingers, of, the, right, hand, are, extended, to, point, in, the, direction, of, v, and, are, then, curled, to, point, in, the, direction, of, b, then, the, extended, thumb, will, point, in, the, direction, of, f, the, term, q, e, is, called, the, electric, force, while, the, term, q, v, b, is, called, the, magnetic, force, according, to, some, definitions, the, term, lorentz, force, refers, specifically, to, the, formula, for, the, magnetic, force, with, the, total, electromagnetic, force, including, the, electric, force, given, some, other, nonstandard, name, this, article, will, not, follow, this, nomenclature, in, what, follows, the, term, lorentz, force, will, refer, to, the, expression, for, the, total, force, the, magnetic, force, component, of, the, lorentz, force, manifests, itself, as, the, force, that, acts, on, a, current, carrying, wire, in, a, magnetic, field, in, that, context, it, is, also, called, the, laplace, force, the, lorentz, force, is, a, force, exerted, by, the, electromagnetic, field, on, the, charged, particle, that, is, it, is, the, rate, at, which, linear, momentum, is, transferred, from, the, electromagnetic, field, to, the, particle, associated, with, it, is, the, power, which, is, the, rate, at, which, energy, is, transferred, from, the, electromagnetic, field, to, the, particle, that, power, is, v, f, q, v, e, displaystyle, mathbf, v, cdot, mathbf, f, q, mathbf, v, cdot, mathbf, e, notice, that, the, magnetic, field, does, not, contribute, to, the, power, because, the, magnetic, force, is, always, perpendicular, to, the, velocity, of, the, particle, for, a, continuous, charge, distribution, in, motion, the, lorentz, force, equation, becomes, d, f, d, q, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathrm, d, mathbf, f, mathrm, d, q, left, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, right, where, d, f, displaystyle, mathrm, d, mathbf, f, is, the, force, on, a, small, piece, of, the, charge, distribution, with, charge, d, q, displaystyle, mathrm, d, q, if, both, sides, of, this, equation, are, divided, by, the, volume, of, this, small, piece, of, the, charge, distribution, d, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, v, the, result, is, f, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, rho, left, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, right, where, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, is, the, force, density, force, per, unit, volume, and, displaystyle, rho, is, the, charge, density, charge, per, unit, volume, next, the, current, density, corresponding, to, the, motion, of, the, charge, continuum, is, j, v, displaystyle, mathbf, j, rho, mathbf, v, so, the, continuous, analogue, to, the, equation, is, f, e, j, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, rho, mathbf, e, mathbf, j, times, mathbf, b, the, total, force, is, the, volume, integral, over, the, charge, distribution, f, e, j, b, d, v, displaystyle, mathbf, f, int, left, rho, mathbf, e, mathbf, j, times, mathbf, b, right, mathrm, d, v, by, eliminating, displaystyle, rho, and, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, using, maxwell, s, equations, and, manipulating, using, the, theorems, of, vector, calculus, this, form, of, the, equation, can, be, used, to, derive, the, maxwell, stress, tensor, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, in, turn, this, can, be, combined, with, the, poynting, vector, s, displaystyle, mathbf, s, to, obtain, the, electromagnetic, stress, energy, tensor, t, used, in, general, relativity, in, terms, of, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, and, s, displaystyle, mathbf, s, another, way, to, write, the, lorentz, force, per, unit, volume, is, f, 1, c, 2, s, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, nabla, cdot, boldsymbol, sigma, dfrac, 1, c, 2, dfrac, partial, mathbf, s, partial, t, where, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, and, denotes, the, divergence, of, a, tensor, field, rather, than, the, amount, of, charge, and, its, velocity, in, electric, and, magnetic, fields, this, equation, relates, the, energy, flux, flow, of, energy, per, unit, time, per, unit, distance, in, the, fields, to, the, force, exerted, on, a, charge, distribution, see, covariant, formulation, of, classical, electromagnetism, for, more, details, the, density, of, power, associated, with, the, lorentz, force, in, a, material, medium, is, j, e, displaystyle, mathbf, j, cdot, mathbf, e, if, we, separate, the, total, charge, and, total, current, into, their, free, and, bound, parts, we, get, that, the, density, of, the, lorentz, force, is, f, f, p, e, j, f, m, p, t, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, left, rho, f, nabla, cdot, mathbf, p, right, mathbf, e, left, mathbf, j, f, nabla, times, mathbf, m, frac, partial, mathbf, p, partial, t, right, times, mathbf, b, where, f, displaystyle, rho, f, is, the, density, of, free, charge, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, is, the, polarization, density, j, f, displaystyle, mathbf, j, f, is, the, density, of, free, current, and, m, displaystyle, mathbf, m, is, the, magnetization, density, in, this, way, the, lorentz, force, can, explain, the, torque, applied, to, a, permanent, magnet, by, the, magnetic, field, the, density, of, the, associated, power, is, j, f, m, p, t, e, displaystyle, left, mathbf, j, f, nabla, times, mathbf, m, frac, partial, mathbf, p, partial, t, right, cdot, mathbf, e, the, above, mentioned, formulae, use, the, conventions, for, the, definition, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, field, used, with, the, si, which, is, the, most, common, however, other, conventions, with, the, same, physics, i, e, forces, on, e, g, an, electron, are, possible, and, used, in, the, conventions, used, with, the, older, cgs, gaussian, units, which, are, somewhat, more, common, among, some, theoretical, physicists, as, well, as, condensed, matter, experimentalists, one, has, instead, f, q, g, e, g, v, c, b, g, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, mathrm, g, left, mathbf, e, mathrm, g, frac, mathbf, v, c, times, mathbf, b, mathrm, g, right, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, although, this, equation, looks, slightly, different, it, is, equivalent, since, one, has, the, following, relations, q, g, q, s, i, 4, 0, e, g, 4, 0, e, s, i, b, g, 4, 0, b, s,

and, si, are, omitted, and, the, used, convention, and, unit, must, be, determined, from, context, early, attempts, to, quantitatively, describe, the, electromagnetic, force, were, made, in, the, mid, 18th, century, it, was, proposed, that, the, force, on, magnetic, poles, by, johann, tobias, mayer, and, others, in, 1760, and, electrically, charged, objects, by, henry, cavendish, in, 1762, obeyed, an, inverse, square, law, however, in, both, cases, the, experimental, proof, was, neither, complete, nor, conclusive, it, was, not, until, 1784, when, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, using, a, torsion, balance, was, able, to, definitively, show, through, experiment, that, this, was, true, soon, after, the, discovery, in, 1820, by, hans, christian, rsted, that, a, magnetic, needle, is, acted, on, by, a, voltaic, current, andr, marie, amp, re, that, same, year, was, able, to, devise, through, experimentation, the, formula, for, the, angular, dependence, of, the, force, between, two, current, elements, in, all, these, descriptions, the, force, was, always, described, in, terms, of, the, properties, of, the, matter, involved, and, the, distances, between, two, masses, or, charges, rather, than, in, terms, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, the, modern, concept, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, first, arose, in, the, theories, of, michael, faraday, particularly, his, idea, of, lines, of, force, later, to, be, given, full, mathematical, description, by, lord, kelvin, and, james, clerk, maxwell, from, a, modern, perspective, it, is, possible, to, identify, in, maxwell, s, 1865, formulation, of, his, field, equations, a, form, of, the, lorentz, force, equation, in, relation, to, electric, currents, although, in, the, time, of, maxwell, it, was, not, evident, how, his, equations, related, to, the, forces, on, moving, charged, objects, j, j, thomson, was, the, first, to, attempt, to, derive, from, maxwell, s, field, equations, the, electromagnetic, forces, on, a, moving, charged, object, in, terms, of, the, object, s, properties, and, external, fields, interested, in, determining, the, electromagnetic, behavior, of, the, charged, particles, in, cathode, rays, thomson, published, a, paper, in, 1881, wherein, he, gave, the, force, on, the, particles, due, to, an, external, magnetic, field, as, f, q, 2, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, q, 2, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, thomson, derived, the, correct, basic, form, of, the, formula, but, because, of, some, miscalculations, and, an, incomplete, description, of, the, displacement, current, included, an, incorrect, scale, factor, of, a, half, in, front, of, the, formula, oliver, heaviside, invented, the, modern, vector, notation, and, applied, it, to, maxwell, s, field, equations, he, also, in, 1885, and, 1889, had, fixed, the, mistakes, of, thomson, s, derivation, and, arrived, at, the, correct, form, of, the, magnetic, force, on, a, moving, charged, object, finally, in, 1895, hendrik, lorentz, derived, the, modern, form, of, the, formula, for, the, electromagnetic, force, which, includes, the, contributions, to, the, total, force, from, both, the, electric, and, the, magnetic, fields, lorentz, began, by, abandoning, the, maxwellian, descriptions, of, the, ether, and, conduction, instead, lorentz, made, a, distinction, between, matter, and, the, luminiferous, aether, and, sought, to, apply, the, maxwell, equations, at, a, microscopic, scale, using, heaviside, s, version, of, the, maxwell, equations, for, a, stationary, ether, and, applying, lagrangian, mechanics, see, below, lorentz, arrived, at, the, correct, and, complete, form, of, the, force, law, that, now, bears, his, name, in, many, cases, of, practical, interest, the, motion, in, a, magnetic, field, of, an, electrically, charged, particle, such, as, an, electron, or, ion, in, a, plasma, can, be, treated, as, the, superposition, of, a, relatively, fast, circular, motion, around, a, point, called, the, guiding, center, and, a, relatively, slow, drift, of, this, point, the, drift, speeds, may, differ, for, various, species, depending, on, their, charge, states, masses, or, temperatures, possibly, resulting, in, electric, currents, or, chemical, separation, while, the, modern, maxwell, s, equations, describe, how, electrically, charged, particles, and, currents, or, moving, charged, particles, give, rise, to, electric, and, magnetic, fields, the, lorentz, force, law, completes, that, picture, by, describing, the, force, acting, on, a, moving, point, charge, q, in, the, presence, of, electromagnetic, fields, the, lorentz, force, law, describes, the, effect, of, e, and, b, upon, a, point, charge, but, such, electromagnetic, forces, are, not, the, entire, picture, charged, particles, are, possibly, coupled, to, other, forces, notably, gravity, and, nuclear, forces, thus, maxwell, s, equations, do, not, stand, separate, from, other, physical, laws, but, are, coupled, to, them, via, the, charge, and, current, densities, the, response, of, a, point, charge, to, the, lorentz, law, is, one, aspect, the, generation, of, e, and, b, by, currents, and, charges, is, another, in, real, materials, the, lorentz, force, is, inadequate, to, describe, the, collective, behavior, of, charged, particles, both, in, principle, and, as, a, matter, of, computation, the, charged, particles, in, a, material, medium, not, only, respond, to, the, e, and, b, fields, but, also, generate, these, fields, complex, transport, equations, must, be, solved, to, determine, the, time, and, spatial, response, of, charges, for, example, the, boltzmann, equation, or, the, fokker, planck, equation, or, the, navier, stokes, equations, for, example, see, magnetohydrodynamics, fluid, dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, superconductivity, stellar, evolution, an, entire, physical, apparatus, for, dealing, with, these, matters, has, developed, see, for, example, green, kubo, relations, and, green, s, function, many, body, theory, when, a, wire, carrying, an, electric, current, is, placed, in, a, magnetic, field, each, of, the, moving, charges, which, comprise, the, current, experiences, the, lorentz, force, and, together, they, can, create, a, macroscopic, force, on, the, wire, sometimes, called, the, laplace, force, by, combining, the, lorentz, force, law, above, with, the, definition, of, electric, current, the, following, equation, results, in, the, case, of, a, straight, stationary, wire, in, a, homogeneous, field, f, i, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, i, boldsymbol, ell, times, mathbf, b, where, is, a, vector, whose, magnitude, is, the, length, of, the, wire, and, whose, direction, is, along, the, wire, aligned, with, the, direction, of, the, conventional, current, i, if, the, wire, is, not, straight, the, force, on, it, can, be, computed, by, applying, this, formula, to, each, infinitesimal, segment, of, wire, d, displaystyle, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, then, adding, up, all, these, forces, by, integration, this, results, in, the, same, formal, expression, but, should, now, be, understood, as, the, vector, connecting, the, end, points, of, the, curved, wire, with, direction, from, starting, to, end, point, of, conventional, current, usually, there, will, also, be, a, net, torque, if, in, addition, the, magnetic, field, is, inhomogeneous, the, net, force, on, a, stationary, rigid, wire, carrying, a, steady, current, i, is, given, by, integration, along, the, wire, f, i, d, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, i, int, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, times, mathbf, b, one, application, of, this, is, amp, re, s, force, law, which, describes, how, two, current, carrying, wires, can, attract, or, repel, each, other, since, each, experiences, a, lorentz, force, from, the, other, s, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, force, q, v, b, component, of, the, lorentz, force, is, responsible, for, motional, electromotive, force, or, motional, emf, the, phenomenon, underlying, many, electrical, generators, when, a, conductor, is, moved, through, a, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, field, exerts, opposite, forces, on, electrons, and, nuclei, in, the, wire, and, this, creates, the, emf, the, term, motional, emf, is, applied, to, this, phenomenon, since, the, emf, is, due, to, the, motion, of, the, wire, in, other, electrical, generators, the, magnets, move, while, the, conductors, do, not, in, this, case, the, emf, is, due, to, the, electric, force, q, e, term, in, the, lorentz, force, equation, the, electric, field, in, question, is, created, by, the, changing, magnetic, field, resulting, in, an, induced, emf, as, described, by, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, one, of, the, four, modern, maxwell, s, equations, both, of, these, emfs, despite, their, apparently, distinct, origins, are, described, by, the, same, equation, namely, the, emf, is, the, rate, of, change, of, magnetic, flux, through, the, wire, this, is, faraday, s, law, of, induction, see, below, einstein, s, special, theory, of, relativity, was, partially, motivated, by, the, desire, to, better, understand, this, link, between, the, two, effects, in, fact, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, different, facets, of, the, same, electromagnetic, field, and, in, moving, from, one, inertial, frame, to, another, the, solenoidal, vector, field, portion, of, the, e, field, can, change, in, whole, or, in, part, to, a, b, field, or, vice, versa, given, a, loop, of, wire, in, a, magnetic, field, faraday, s, law, of, induction, states, the, induced, electromotive, force, emf, in, the, wire, is, e, d, b, d, t, displaystyle, mathcal, e, frac, mathrm, d, phi, b, mathrm, d, t, where, b, t, d, a, b, r, t, displaystyle, phi, b, int, sigma, t, mathrm, d, mathbf, a, cdot,

vector, area, element, of, t, magnitude, is, the, area, of, an, infinitesimal, patch, of, surface, direction, is, orthogonal, to, that, surface, patch, the, sign, of, the, emf, is, determined, by, lenz, s, law, note, that, this, is, valid, for, not, only, a, stationary, wire, but, also, for, a, moving, wire, from, faraday, s, law, of, induction, that, is, valid, for, a, moving, wire, for, instance, in, a, motor, and, the, maxwell, equations, the, lorentz, force, can, be, deduced, the, reverse, is, also, true, the, lorentz, force, and, the, maxwell, equations, can, be, used, to, derive, the, faraday, law, let, t, be, the, moving, wire, moving, together, without, rotation, and, with, constant, velocity, v, and, t, be, the, internal, surface, of, the, wire, the, emf, around, the,
