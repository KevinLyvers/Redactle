in, thermodynamics, the, thermodynamic, free, energy, is, one, of, the, state, functions, of, a, thermodynamic, system, the, others, being, internal, energy, enthalpy, entropy, etc, the, change, in, the, free, energy, is, the, maximum, amount, of, work, that, the, system, can, perform, in, a, process, at, constant, temperature, and, its, sign, indicates, whether, the, process, is, thermodynamically, favorable, or, forbidden, since, free, energy, usually, contains, potential, energy, it, is, not, absolute, but, depends, on, the, choice, of, a, zero, point, therefore, only, relative, free, energy, values, or, changes, in, free, energy, are, physically, meaningful, the, free, energy, is, the, portion, of, any, first, law, energy, that, is, available, to, perform, thermodynamic, work, at, constant, temperature, i, e, work, mediated, by, thermal, energy, free, energy, is, subject, to, irreversible, loss, in, the, course, of, such, work, since, first, law, energy, is, always, conserved, it, is, evident, that, free, energy, is, an, expendable, second, law, kind, of, energy, several, free, energy, functions, may, be, formulated, based, on, system, criteria, free, energy, functions, are, legendre, transforms, of, the, internal, energy, the, gibbs, free, energy, is, given, by, g, h, ts, where, h, is, the, enthalpy, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, s, is, the, entropy, h, u, pv, where, u, is, the, internal, energy, p, is, the, pressure, and, v, is, the, volume, g, is, the, most, useful, for, processes, involving, a, system, at, constant, pressure, p, and, temperature, t, because, in, addition, to, subsuming, any, entropy, change, due, merely, to, heat, a, change, in, g, also, excludes, the, p, dv, work, needed, to, make, space, for, additional, molecules, produced, by, various, processes, gibbs, free, energy, change, therefore, equals, work, not, associated, with, system, expansion, or, compression, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, hence, its, utility, to, solution, phase, chemists, including, biochemists, the, historically, earlier, helmholtz, free, energy, is, defined, in, contrast, as, a, u, ts, its, change, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, reversible, work, done, on, or, obtainable, from, a, system, at, constant, t, thus, its, appellation, work, content, and, the, designation, a, from, german, arbeit, work, since, it, makes, no, reference, to, any, quantities, involved, in, work, such, as, p, and, v, the, helmholtz, function, is, completely, general, its, decrease, is, the, maximum, amount, of, work, which, can, be, done, by, a, system, at, constant, temperature, and, it, can, increase, at, most, by, the, amount, of, work, done, on, a, system, isothermally, the, helmholtz, free, energy, has, a, special, theoretical, importance, since, it, is, proportional, to, the, logarithm, of, the, partition, function, for, the, canonical, ensemble, in, statistical, mechanics, hence, its, utility, to, physicists, and, to, gas, phase, chemists, and, engineers, who, do, not, want, to, ignore, p, dv, work, historically, the, term, free, energy, has, been, used, for, either, quantity, in, physics, free, energy, most, often, refers, to, the, helmholtz, free, energy, denoted, by, a, or, f, while, in, chemistry, free, energy, most, often, refers, to, the, gibbs, free, energy, the, values, of, the, two, free, energies, are, usually, quite, similar, and, the, intended, free, energy, function, is, often, implicit, in, manuscripts, and, presentations, the, basic, definition, of, energy, is, a, measure, of, a, body, s, in, thermodynamics, the, system, s, ability, to, cause, change, for, example, when, a, person, pushes, a, heavy, box, a, few, metres, forward, that, person, exerts, mechanical, energy, also, known, as, work, on, the, box, over, a, distance, of, a, few, meters, forward, the, mathematical, definition, of, this, form, of, energy, is, the, product, of, the, force, exerted, on, the, object, and, the, distance, by, which, the, box, moved, work, force, distance, because, the, person, changed, the, stationary, position, of, the, box, that, person, exerted, energy, on, that, box, the, work, exerted, can, also, be, called, useful, energy, because, energy, was, converted, from, one, form, into, the, intended, purpose, i, e, mechanical, use, for, the, case, of, the, person, pushing, the, box, the, energy, in, the, form, of, internal, or, potential, energy, obtained, through, metabolism, was, converted, into, work, to, push, the, box, this, energy, conversion, however, was, not, straightforward, while, some, internal, energy, went, into, pushing, the, box, some, was, diverted, away, lost, in, the, form, of, heat, transferred, thermal, energy, for, a, reversible, process, heat, is, the, product, of, the, absolute, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, and, the, change, in, entropy, s, displaystyle, s, of, a, body, entropy, is, a, measure, of, disorder, in, a, system, the, difference, between, the, change, in, internal, energy, which, is, u, displaystyle, delta, u, and, the, energy, lost, in, the, form, of, heat, is, what, is, called, the, useful, energy, of, the, body, or, the, work, of, the, body, performed, on, an, object, in, thermodynamics, this, is, what, is, known, as, free, energy, in, other, words, free, energy, is, a, measure, of, work, useful, energy, a, system, can, perform, at, constant, temperature, mathematically, free, energy, is, expressed, as, a, u, t, s, displaystyle, a, u, ts, this, expression, has, commonly, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, work, is, extracted, from, the, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, u, while, t, s, displaystyle, ts, represents, energy, not, available, to, perform, work, however, this, is, incorrect, for, instance, in, an, isothermal, expansion, of, an, ideal, gas, the, internal, energy, change, is, u, 0, displaystyle, delta, u, 0, and, the, expansion, work, w, t, s, displaystyle, w, t, delta, s, is, derived, exclusively, from, the, t, s, displaystyle, ts, term, supposedly, not, available, to, perform, work, but, it, is, noteworthy, that, the, derivative, form, of, the, free, energy, d, a, s, d, t, p, d, v, displaystyle, da, sdt, pdv, for, helmholtz, free, energy, does, indeed, indicate, that, a, spontaneous, change, in, a, non, reactive, system, s, free, energy, not, the, internal, energy, comprises, the, available, energy, to, do, work, compression, in, this, case, p, d, v, displaystyle, pdv, and, the, unavailable, energy, s, d, t, displaystyle, sdt, similar, expression, can, be, written, for, the, gibbs, free, energy, change, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, theory, of, heat, i, e, that, heat, is, a, form, of, energy, having, relation, to, vibratory, motion, was, beginning, to, supplant, both, the, caloric, theory, i, e, that, heat, is, a, fluid, and, the, four, element, theory, in, which, heat, was, the, lightest, of, the, four, elements, in, a, similar, manner, during, these, years, heat, was, beginning, to, be, distinguished, into, different, classification, categories, such, as, free, heat, combined, heat, radiant, heat, specific, heat, heat, capacity, absolute, heat, latent, caloric, free, or, perceptible, caloric, calorique, sensible, among, others, in, 1780, for, example, laplace, and, lavoisier, stated, in, general, one, can, change, the, first, hypothesis, into, the, second, by, changing, the, words, free, heat, combined, heat, and, heat, released, into, vis, viva, loss, of, vis, viva, and, increase, of, vis, viva, in, this, manner, the, total, mass, of, caloric, in, a, body, called, absolute, heat, was, regarded, as, a, mixture, of, two, components, the, free, or, perceptible, caloric, could, affect, a, thermometer, whereas, the, other, component, the, latent, caloric, could, not, the, use, of, the, words, latent, heat, implied, a, similarity, to, latent, heat, in, the, more, usual, sense, it, was, regarded, as, chemically, bound, to, the, molecules, of, the, body, in, the, adiabatic, compression, of, a, gas, the, absolute, heat, remained, constant, but, the, observed, rise, in, temperature, implied, that, some, latent, caloric, had, become, free, or, perceptible, during, the, early, 19th, century, the, concept, of, perceptible, or, free, caloric, began, to, be, referred, to, as, free, heat, or, heat, set, free, in, 1824, for, example, the, french, physicist, sadi, carnot, in, his, famous, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, speaks, of, quantities, of, heat, absorbed, or, set, free, in, different, transformations, in, 1882, the, german, physicist, and, physiologist, hermann, von, helmholtz, coined, the, phrase, free, energy, for, the, expression, a, u, t, s, displaystyle, a, u, ts, in, which, the, change, in, a, or, g, determines, the, amount, of, energy, free, for, work, under, the, given, conditions, specifically, constant, temperature, 235, thus, in, traditional, use, the, term, free, was, attached, to, gibbs, free, energy, for, systems, at, constant, pressure, and, temperature, or, to, helmholtz, free, energy, for, systems, at, constant, temperature, to, mean, available, in, the, form, of, useful, work, with, reference, to, the, gibbs, free, energy, we, need, to, add, the, qualification, that, it, is, the, energy, free, for, non, volume, work, and, compositional, changes, 77, 79, an, increasing, number, of, books, and, journal, articles, do, not, include, the, attachment, free, referring, to, g, as, simply, gibbs, energy, and, likewise, for, the, helmholtz, energy, this, is, the, result, of, a, 1988, iupac, meeting, to, set, unified, terminologies, for, the, international, scientific, community, in, which, the, adjective, free, was, supposedly, banished, this, standard, however, has, not, yet, been, universally, adopted, and, many, published, articles, and, books, still, include, the, descriptive, free, just, like, the, general, concept, of, energy, free, energy, has, a, few, definitions, suitable, for, different, conditions, in, physics, chemistry, and, biology, these, conditions, are, thermodynamic, parameters, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, volume, v, displaystyle, v, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, etc, scientists, have, come, up, with, several, ways, to, define, free, energy, the, mathematical, expression, of, helmholtz, free, energy, is, this, definition, of, free, energy, is, useful, for, gas, phase, reactions, or, in, physics, when, modeling, the, behavior, of, isolated, systems, kept, at, a, constant, volume, for, example, if, a, researcher, wanted, to, perform, a, combustion, reaction, in, a, bomb, calorimeter, the, volume, is, kept, constant, throughout, the, course, of, a, reaction, therefore, the, heat, of, the, reaction, is, a, direct, measure, of, the, free, energy, change, q, u, displaystyle, q, delta, u, in, solution, chemistry, on, the, other, hand, most, chemical, reactions, are, kept, at, constant, pressure, under, this, condition, the, heat, q, displaystyle, q, of, the, reaction, is, equal, to, the, enthalpy, change, h, displaystyle, delta, h, of, the, system, under, constant, pressure, and, temperature, the, free, energy, in, a, reaction, is, known, as, gibbs, free, energy, g, displaystyle, g, these, functions, have, a, minimum, in, chemical, equilibrium, as, long, as, certain, variables, t, displaystyle, t, and, v, displaystyle, v, or, p, displaystyle, p, are, held, constant, in, addition, they, also, have, theoretical, importance, in, deriving, maxwell, relations, work, other, than, p, dv, may, be, added, e, g, for, electrochemical, cells, or, f, dx, work, in, elastic, materials, and, in, muscle, contraction, other, forms, of, work, which, must, sometimes, be, considered, are, stress, strain, magnetic, as, in, adiabatic, de, magnetization, used, in, the, approach, to, absolute, zero, and, work, due, to, electric, polarization, these, are, described, by, tensors, in, most, cases, of, interest, there, are, internal, degrees, of, freedom, and, processes, such, as, chemical, reactions, and, phase, transitions, which, create, entropy, even, for, homogeneous, bulk, materials, the, free, energy, functions, depend, on, the, often, suppressed, composition, as, do, all, proper, thermodynamic, potentials, extensive, functions, including, the, internal, energy, n, i, displaystyle, n, i, is, the, number, of, molecules, alternatively, moles, of, type, i, displaystyle, i, in, the, system, if, these, quantities, do, not, appear, it, is, impossible, to, describe, compositional, changes, the, differentials, for, processes, at, uniform, pressure, and, temperature, are, assuming, only, p, v, displaystyle, pv, work, where, i, is, the, chemical, potential, for, the, i, th, component, in, the, system, the, second, relation, is, especially, useful, at, constant, t, displaystyle, t, and, p, displaystyle, p, conditions, which, are, easy, to, achieve, experimentally, and, which, approximately, characterize, living, creatures, under, these, conditions, it, simplifies, to, any, decrease, in, the, gibbs, function, of, a, system, is, the, upper, limit, for, any, isothermal, isobaric, work, that, can, be, captured, in, the, surroundings, or, it, may, simply, be, dissipated, appearing, as, t, displaystyle, t, times, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, entropy, of, the, system, and, or, its, surrounding, an, example, is, surface, free, energy, the, amount, of, increase, of, free, energy, when, the, area, of, surface, increases, by, every, unit, area, the, path, integral, monte, carlo, method, is, a, numerical, approach, for, determining, the, values, of, free, energies, based, on, quantum, dynamical, principles, for, a, reversible, isothermal, process, s, q, rev, t, and, therefore, the, definition, of, a, results, in, this, tells, us, that, the, change, in, free, energy, equals, the, reversible, or, maximum, work, for, a, process, performed, at, constant, temperature, under, other, conditions, free, energy, change, is, not, equal, to, work, for, instance, for, a, reversible, adiabatic, expansion, of, an, ideal, gas, a, w, rev, s, t, displaystyle, delta, a, w, text, rev, s, delta, t, importantly, for, a, heat, engine, including, the, carnot, cycle, the, free, energy, change, after, a, full, cycle, is, zero, cyc, a, 0, displaystyle, delta, text, cyc, a, 0, while, the, engine, produces, nonzero, work, it, is, important, to, note, that, for, heat, engines, and, other, thermal, systems, the, free, energies, do, not, offer, convenient, characterizations, internal, energy, and, enthalpy, are, the, preferred, potentials, for, characterizing, thermal, systems, according, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, for, any, process, that, occurs, in, a, closed, system, the, inequality, of, clausius, s, q, t, surr, applies, for, a, process, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, without, non, pv, work, this, inequality, transforms, into, g, 0, displaystyle, delta, g, 0, similarly, for, a, process, at, constant, temperature, and, volume, a, 0, displaystyle, delta, a, 0, thus, a, negative, value, of, the, change, in, free, energy, is, a, necessary, condition, for, a, process, to, be, spontaneous, this, is, the, most, useful, form, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, chemistry, in, chemical, equilibrium, at, constant, t, and, p, without, electrical, work, d, g, 0, the, quantity, called, free, energy, is, a, more, advanced, and, accurate, replacement, for, the, outdated, term, affinity, which, was, used, by, chemists, in, previous, years, to, describe, the, force, that, caused, chemical, reactions, the, term, affinity, as, used, in, chemical, relation, dates, back, to, at, least, the, time, of, albertus, magnus, from, the, 1998, textbook, modern, thermodynamics, by, nobel, laureate, and, chemistry, professor, ilya, prigogine, we, find, as, motion, was, explained, by, the, newtonian, concept, of, force, chemists, wanted, a, similar, concept, of, driving, force, for, chemical, change, why, do, chemical, reactions, occur, and, why, do, they, stop, at, certain, points, chemists, called, the, force, that, caused, chemical, reactions, affinity, but, it, lacked, a, clear, definition, during, the, entire, 18th, century, the, dominant, view, with, regard, to, heat, and, light, was, that, put, forth, by, isaac, newton, called, the, newtonian, hypothesis, which, states, that, light, and, heat, are, forms, of, matter, attracted, or, repelled, by, other, forms, of, matter, with, forces, analogous, to, gravitation, or, to, chemical, affinity, in, the, 19th, century, the, french, chemist, marcellin, berthelot, and, the, danish, chemist, julius, thomsen, had, attempted, to, quantify, affinity, using, heats, of, reaction, in, 1875, after, quantifying, the, heats, of, reaction, for, a, large, number, of, compounds, berthelot, proposed, the, principle, of, maximum, work, in, which, all, chemical, changes, occurring, without, intervention, of, outside, energy, tend, toward, the, production, of, bodies, or, of, a, system, of, bodies, which, liberate, heat, in, addition, to, this, in, 1780, antoine, lavoisier, and, pierre, simon, laplace, laid, the, foundations, of, thermochemistry, by, showing, that, the, heat, given, out, in, a, reaction, is, equal, to, the, heat, absorbed, in, the, reverse, reaction, they, also, investigated, the, specific, heat, and, latent, heat, of, a, number, of, substances, and, amounts, of, heat, given, out, in, combustion, in, a, similar, manner, in, 1840, swiss, chemist, germain, hess, formulated, the, principle, that, the, evolution, of, heat, in, a, reaction, is, the, same, whether, the, process, is, accomplished, in, one, step, process, or, in, a, number, of, stages, this, is, known, as, hess, law, with, the, advent, of, the, mechanical, theory, of, heat, in, the, early, 19th, century, hess, s, law, came, to, be, viewed, as, a, consequence, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, based, on, these, and, other, ideas, berthelot, and, thomsen, as, well, as, others, considered, the, heat, given, out, in, the, formation, of, a, compound, as, a, measure, of, the, affinity, or, the, work, done, by, the, chemical, forces, this, view, however, was, not, entirely, correct, in, 1847, the, english, physicist, james, joule, showed, that, he, could, raise, the, temperature, of, water, by, turning, a, paddle, wheel, in, it, thus, showing, that, heat, and, mechanical, work, were, equivalent, or, proportional, to, each, other, i, e, approximately, dw, dq, this, statement, came, to, be, known, as, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, and, was, a, precursory, form, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, by, 1865, the, german, physicist, rudolf, clausius, had, shown, that, this, equivalence, principle, needed, amendment, that, is, one, can, use, the, heat, derived, from, a, combustion, reaction, in, a, coal, furnace, to, boil, water, and, use, this, heat, to, vaporize, steam, and, then, use, the, enhanced, high, pressure, energy, of, the, vaporized, steam, to, push, a, piston, thus, we, might, naively, reason, that, one, can, entirely, convert, the, initial, combustion, heat, of, the, chemical, reaction, into, the, work, of, pushing, the, piston, clausius, showed, however, that, we, must, take, into, account, the, work, that, the, molecules, of, the, working, body, i, e, the, water, molecules, in, the, cylinder, do, on, each, other, as, they, pass, or, transform, from, one, step, of, or, state, of, the, engine, cycle, to, the, next, e, g, from, p, 1, v, 1, displaystyle, p, 1, v, 1, to, p, 2, v, 2, displaystyle, p, 2, v, 2, clausius, originally, called, this, the, transformation, content, of, the, body, and, then, later, changed, the, name, to, entropy, thus, the, heat, used, to, transform, the, working, body, of, molecules, from, one, state, to, the, next, cannot, be, used, to, do, external, work, e, g, to, push, the, piston, clausius, defined, this, transformation, heat, as, d, q, t, d, s, displaystyle, dq, tds, in, 1873, willard, gibbs, published, a, method, of, geometrical, representation, of, the, thermodynamic, properties, of, substances, by, means, of, surfaces, in, which, he, introduced, the, preliminary, outline, of, the, principles, of, his, new, equation, able, to, predict, or, estimate, the, tendencies, of, various, natural, processes, to, ensue, when, bodies, or, systems, are, brought, into, contact, by, studying, the, interactions, of, homogeneous, substances, in, contact, i, e, bodies, being, in, composition, part, solid, part, liquid, and, part, vapor, and, by, using, a, three, dimensional, volume, entropy, internal, energy, graph, gibbs, was, able, to, determine, three, states, of, equilibrium, i, e, necessarily, stable, neutral, and, unstable, and, whether, or, not, changes, will, ensue, in, 1876, gibbs, built, on, this, framework, by, introducing, the, concept, of, chemical, potential, so, to, take, into, account, chemical, reactions, and, states, of, bodies, that, are, chemically, different, from, each, other, in, his, own, words, to, summarize, his, results, in, 1873, gibbs, states, if, we, wish, to, express, in, a, single, equation, the, necessary, and, sufficient, condition, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, for, a, substance, when, surrounded, by, a, medium, of, constant, pressure, p, and, temperature, t, this, equation, may, be, written, when, refers, to, the, variation, produced, by, any, variations, in, the, state, of, the, parts, of, the, body, and, when, different, parts, of, the, body, are, in, different, states, in, the, proportion, in, which, the, body, is, divided, between, the, different, states, the, condition, of, stable, equilibrium, is, that, the, value, of, the, expression, in, the, parenthesis, shall, be, a, minimum, in, this, description, as, used, by, gibbs, refers, to, the, internal, energy, of, the, body, refers, to, the, entropy, of, the, body, and, is, the, volume, of, the, body, hence, in, 1882, after, the, introduction, of, these, arguments, by, clausius, and, gibbs, the, german, scientist, hermann, von, helmholtz, stated, in, opposition, to, berthelot, and, thomas, hypothesis, that, chemical, affinity, is, a, measure, of, the, heat, of, reaction, of, chemical, reaction, as, based, on, the, principle, of, maximal, work, that, affinity, is, not, the, heat, given, out, in, the, formation, of, a, compound, but, rather, it, is, the, largest, quantity, of, work, which, can, be, gained, when, the, reaction, is, carried, out, in, a, reversible, manner, e, g, electrical, work, in, a, reversible, cell, the, maximum, work, is, thus, regarded, as, the, diminution, of, the, free, or, available, energy, of, the, system, gibbs, free, energy, g, at, t, constant, p, constant, or, helmholtz, free, energy, a, at, t, constant, v, constant, whilst, the, heat, given, out, is, usually, a, measure, of, the, diminution, of, the, total, energy, of, the, system, internal, energy, thus, g, or, a, is, the, amount, of, energy, free, for, work, under, the, given, conditions, up, until, this, point, the, general, view, had, been, such, that, all, chemical, reactions, drive, the, system, to, a, state, of, equilibrium, in, which, the, affinities, of, the, reactions, vanish, over, the, next, 60, years, the, term, affinity, came, to, be, replaced, with, the, term, free, energy, according, to, chemistry, historian, henry, leicester, the, influential, 1923, textbook, thermodynamics, and, the, free, energy, of, chemical, reactions, by, gilbert, n, lewis, and, merle, randall, led, to, the, replacement, of, the, term, affinity, by, the, term, free, energy, in, much, of, the, english, speaking, world
