a, blazar, is, an, active, galactic, nucleus, agn, with, a, relativistic, jet, a, jet, composed, of, ionized, matter, traveling, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, directed, very, nearly, towards, an, observer, relativistic, beaming, of, electromagnetic, radiation, from, the, jet, makes, blazars, appear, much, brighter, than, they, would, be, if, the, jet, were, pointed, in, a, direction, away, from, earth, blazars, are, powerful, sources, of, emission, across, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, are, observed, to, be, sources, of, high, energy, gamma, ray, photons, blazars, are, highly, variable, sources, often, undergoing, rapid, and, dramatic, fluctuations, in, brightness, on, short, timescales, hours, to, days, some, blazar, jets, appear, to, exhibit, superluminal, motion, another, consequence, of, material, in, the, jet, traveling, toward, the, observer, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, the, blazar, category, includes, bl, lac, objects, and, optically, violently, variable, ovv, quasars, the, generally, accepted, theory, is, that, bl, lac, objects, are, intrinsically, low, power, radio, galaxies, while, ovv, quasars, are, intrinsically, powerful, radio, loud, quasars, the, name, blazar, was, coined, in, 1978, by, astronomer, edward, spiegel, to, denote, the, combination, of, these, two, classes, in, visible, wavelength, images, most, blazars, appear, compact, and, pointlike, but, high, resolution, images, reveal, that, they, are, located, at, the, centers, of, elliptical, galaxies, blazars, are, important, topics, of, research, in, astronomy, and, high, energy, astrophysics, blazar, research, includes, investigation, of, the, properties, of, accretion, disks, and, jets, the, central, supermassive, black, holes, and, surrounding, host, galaxies, and, the, emission, of, high, energy, photons, cosmic, rays, and, neutrinos, in, july, 2018, the, icecube, neutrino, observatory, team, traced, a, neutrino, that, hit, its, antarctica, based, detector, in, september, 2017, to, its, point, of, origin, in, a, blazar, 3, 7, billion, light, years, away, this, was, the, first, time, that, a, neutrino, detector, was, used, to, locate, an, object, in, space, blazars, like, all, active, galactic, nuclei, agn, are, thought, to, be, powered, by, material, falling, into, a, supermassive, black, hole, in, the, core, of, the, host, galaxy, gas, dust, and, the, occasional, star, are, captured, and, spiral, into, this, central, black, hole, creating, a, hot, accretion, disk, which, generates, enormous, amounts, of, energy, in, the, form, of, photons, electrons, positrons, and, other, elementary, particles, this, region, is, relatively, small, approximately, 10, 3, parsecs, in, size, there, is, also, a, larger, opaque, toroid, extending, several, parsecs, from, the, black, hole, containing, a, hot, gas, with, embedded, regions, of, higher, density, these, clouds, can, absorb, and, re, emit, energy, from, regions, closer, to, the, black, hole, on, earth, the, clouds, are, detected, as, emission, lines, in, the, blazar, spectrum, perpendicular, to, the, accretion, disk, a, pair, of, relativistic, jets, carries, highly, energetic, plasma, away, from, the, agn, the, jet, is, collimated, by, a, combination, of, intense, magnetic, fields, and, powerful, winds, from, the, accretion, disk, and, toroid, inside, the, jet, high, energy, photons, and, particles, interact, with, each, other, and, the, strong, magnetic, field, these, relativistic, jets, can, extend, as, far, as, many, tens, of, kiloparsecs, from, the, central, black, hole, all, of, these, regions, can, produce, a, variety, of, observed, energy, mostly, in, the, form, of, a, nonthermal, spectrum, ranging, from, very, low, frequency, radio, to, extremely, energetic, gamma, rays, with, a, high, polarization, typically, a, few, percent, at, some, frequencies, the, nonthermal, spectrum, consists, of, synchrotron, radiation, in, the, radio, to, x, ray, range, and, inverse, compton, emission, in, the, x, ray, to, gamma, ray, region, a, thermal, spectrum, peaking, in, the, ultraviolet, region, and, faint, optical, emission, lines, are, also, present, in, ovv, quasars, but, faint, or, non, existent, in, bl, lac, objects, the, observed, emission, from, a, blazar, is, greatly, enhanced, by, relativistic, effects, in, the, jet, a, process, called, relativistic, beaming, the, bulk, speed, of, the, plasma, that, constitutes, the, jet, can, be, in, the, range, of, 95, 99, of, the, speed, of, light, although, individual, particles, move, at, higher, speeds, in, various, directions, the, relationship, between, the, luminosity, emitted, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, jet, and, the, luminosity, observed, from, earth, depends, on, the, characteristics, of, the, jet, these, include, whether, the, luminosity, arises, from, a, shock, front, or, a, series, of, brighter, blobs, in, the, jet, as, well, as, details, of, the, magnetic, fields, within, the, jet, and, their, interaction, with, the, moving, particles, a, simple, model, of, beaming, illustrates, the, basic, relativistic, effects, connecting, the, luminosity, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, jet, s, e, and, the, luminosity, observed, on, earth, s, o, s, o, is, proportional, to, s, e, d, 2, where, d, is, the, doppler, factor, when, considered, in, much, more, detail, three, relativistic, effects, are, involved, consider, a, jet, with, an, angle, to, the, line, of, sight, 5, and, a, speed, of, 99, 9, of, the, speed, of, light, the, luminosity, observed, from, earth, is, 70, times, greater, than, the, emitted, luminosity, however, if, is, at, the, minimum, value, of, 0, the, jet, will, appear, 600, times, brighter, from, earth, relativistic, beaming, also, has, another, critical, consequence, the, jet, which, is, not, approaching, earth, will, appear, dimmer, because, of, the, same, relativistic, effects, therefore, two, intrinsically, identical, jets, will, appear, significantly, asymmetric, in, the, example, given, above, any, jet, where, 35, will, be, observed, on, earth, as, less, luminous, than, it, would, be, from, the, rest, frame, of, the, jet, a, further, consequence, is, that, a, population, of, intrinsically, identical, agn, scattered, in, space, with, random, jet, orientations, will, look, like, a, very, inhomogeneous, population, on, earth, the, few, objects, where, is, small, will, have, one, very, bright, jet, while, the, rest, will, apparently, have, considerably, weaker, jets, those, where, varies, from, 90, will, appear, to, have, asymmetric, jets, this, is, the, essence, behind, the, connection, between, blazars, and, radio, galaxies, agn, which, have, jets, oriented, close, to, the, line, of, sight, with, earth, can, appear, extremely, different, from, other, agn, even, if, they, are, intrinsically, identical, many, of, the, brighter, blazars, were, first, identified, not, as, powerful, distant, galaxies, but, as, irregular, variable, stars, in, our, own, galaxy, these, blazars, like, genuine, irregular, variable, stars, changed, in, brightness, on, periods, of, days, or, years, but, with, no, pattern, the, early, development, of, radio, astronomy, had, shown, that, there, are, many, bright, radio, sources, in, the, sky, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, the, resolution, of, radio, telescopes, was, sufficient, to, identify, specific, radio, sources, with, optical, counterparts, leading, to, the, discovery, of, quasars, blazars, were, highly, represented, among, these, early, quasars, and, the, first, redshift, was, found, for, 3c, 273, a, highly, variable, quasar, which, is, also, a, blazar, in, 1968, a, similar, connection, was, made, between, the, variable, star, bl, lacertae, and, a, powerful, radio, source, vro, 42, 22, 01, bl, lacertae, shows, many, of, the, characteristics, of, quasars, but, the, optical, spectrum, was, devoid, of, the, spectral, lines, used, to, determine, redshift, faint, indications, of, an, underlying, galaxy, proof, that, bl, lacertae, was, not, a, star, were, found, in, 1974, the, extragalactic, nature, of, bl, lacertae, was, not, a, surprise, in, 1972, a, few, variable, optical, and, radio, sources, were, grouped, together, and, proposed, as, a, new, class, of, galaxy, bl, lacertae, type, objects, this, terminology, was, soon, shortened, to, bl, lacertae, object, bl, lac, object, or, simply, bl, lac, the, latter, term, can, also, mean, the, original, individual, blazar, and, not, the, entire, class, as, of, 2003, a, few, hundred, bl, lac, objects, were, known, one, of, the, closest, blazars, is, 2, 5, billion, light, years, away, blazars, are, thought, to, be, active, galactic, nuclei, with, relativistic, jets, oriented, close, to, the, line, of, sight, with, the, observer, the, special, jet, orientation, explains, the, general, peculiar, characteristics, high, observed, luminosity, very, rapid, variation, high, polarization, compared, to, non, blazar, quasars, and, the, apparent, superluminal, motions, detected, along, the, first, few, parsecs, of, the, jets, in, most, blazars, a, unified, scheme, or, unified, model, has, become, generally, accepted, where, highly, variable, quasars, are, related, to, intrinsically, powerful, radio, galaxies, and, bl, lac, objects, are, related, to, intrinsically, weak, radio, galaxies, the, distinction, between, these, two, connected, populations, explains, the, difference, in, emission, line, properties, in, blazars, other, explanations, for, the, relativistic, jet, unified, scheme, approach, which, have, been, proposed, include, gravitational, microlensing, and, coherent, emission, from, the, relativistic, jet, neither, of, these, explains, the, overall, properties, of, blazars, for, example, microlensing, is, achromatic, that, is, all, parts, of, a, spectrum, would, rise, and, fall, together, this, is, not, observed, in, blazars, however, it, is, possible, that, these, processes, as, well, as, more, complex, plasma, physics, can, account, for, specific, observations, or, some, details, examples, of, blazars, include, 3c, 454, 3, 3c, 273, bl, lacertae, pks, 2155, 304, markarian, 421, markarian, 501, 4c, 71, 07, pks, 0537, 286, qso, 0537, 286, and, s5, 0014, 81, markarian, 501, and, s5, 0014, 81, are, also, called, tev, blazars, for, their, high, energy, teraelectron, volt, range, gamma, ray, emission, in, july, 2018, a, blazar, called, txs, 0506, 056, was, identified, as, source, of, high, energy, neutrinos, by, the, icecube, project
