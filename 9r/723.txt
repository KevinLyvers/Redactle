atmospheric, pressure, also, known, as, air, pressure, or, barometric, pressure, after, the, barometer, is, the, pressure, within, the, atmosphere, of, earth, the, standard, atmosphere, symbol, atm, is, a, unit, of, pressure, defined, as, 101, 325, pa, 1, 013, 25, hpa, which, is, equivalent, to, 1, 013, 25, millibars, 760, mm, hg, 29, 9212, inches, hg, or, 14, 696, psi, the, atm, unit, is, roughly, equivalent, to, the, mean, sea, level, atmospheric, pressure, on, earth, that, is, the, earth, s, atmospheric, pressure, at, sea, level, is, approximately, 1, atm, in, most, circumstances, atmospheric, pressure, is, closely, approximated, by, the, hydrostatic, pressure, caused, by, the, weight, of, air, above, the, measurement, point, as, elevation, increases, there, is, less, overlying, atmospheric, mass, so, atmospheric, pressure, decreases, with, increasing, elevation, because, the, atmosphere, is, thin, relative, to, the, earth, s, radius, especially, the, dense, atmospheric, layer, at, low, altitudes, the, earth, s, gravitational, acceleration, as, a, function, of, altitude, can, be, approximated, as, constant, and, contributes, little, to, this, fall, off, pressure, measures, force, per, unit, area, with, si, units, of, pascals, 1, pascal, 1, newton, per, square, metre, 1, n, m, 2, on, average, a, column, of, air, with, a, cross, sectional, area, of, 1, square, centimetre, cm, 2, measured, from, the, mean, average, sea, level, to, the, top, of, earth, s, atmosphere, has, a, mass, of, about, 1, 03, kilogram, and, exerts, a, force, or, weight, of, about, 10, 1, newtons, resulting, in, a, pressure, of, 10, 1, n, cm, 2, or, 101, kn, m, 2, 101, kilopascals, kpa, a, column, of, air, with, a, cross, sectional, area, of, 1, in, 2, would, have, a, weight, of, about, 14, 7, lbf, resulting, in, a, pressure, of, 14, 7, lbf, in, 2, atmospheric, pressure, is, caused, by, the, gravitational, attraction, of, the, planet, on, the, atmospheric, gases, above, the, surface, and, is, a, function, of, the, mass, of, the, planet, the, radius, of, the, surface, and, the, amount, and, composition, of, the, gases, and, their, vertical, distribution, in, the, atmosphere, it, is, modified, by, the, planetary, rotation, and, local, effects, such, as, wind, velocity, density, variations, due, to, temperature, and, variations, in, composition, the, mean, sea, level, pressure, mslp, is, the, atmospheric, pressure, at, mean, sea, level, this, is, the, atmospheric, pressure, normally, given, in, weather, reports, on, radio, television, and, newspapers, or, on, the, internet, the, altimeter, setting, in, aviation, is, an, atmospheric, pressure, adjustment, average, sea, level, pressure, is, 1, 013, 25, hpa, 29, 921, inhg, 760, 00, mmhg, in, aviation, weather, reports, metar, qnh, is, transmitted, around, the, world, in, hectopascals, or, millibars, 1, hectopascal, 1, millibar, except, in, the, united, states, canada, and, japan, where, it, is, reported, in, inches, of, mercury, to, two, decimal, places, the, united, states, and, canada, also, report, sea, level, pressure, slp, which, is, adjusted, to, sea, level, by, a, different, method, in, the, remarks, section, not, in, the, internationally, transmitted, part, of, the, code, in, hectopascals, or, millibars, however, in, canada, s, public, weather, reports, sea, level, pressure, is, instead, reported, in, kilopascals, in, the, us, weather, code, remarks, three, digits, are, all, that, are, transmitted, decimal, points, and, the, one, or, two, most, significant, digits, are, omitted, 1, 013, 2, hpa, 14, 695, psi, is, transmitted, as, 132, 1, 000, hpa, 100, kpa, is, transmitted, as, 000, 998, 7, hpa, is, transmitted, as, 987, etc, the, highest, sea, level, pressure, on, earth, occurs, in, siberia, where, the, siberian, high, often, attains, a, sea, level, pressure, above, 1, 050, hpa, 15, 2, psi, 31, inhg, with, record, highs, close, to, 1, 085, hpa, 15, 74, psi, 32, 0, inhg, the, lowest, measurable, sea, level, pressure, is, found, at, the, centres, of, tropical, cyclones, and, tornadoes, with, a, record, low, of, 870, hpa, 12, 6, psi, 26, inhg, surface, pressure, is, the, atmospheric, pressure, at, a, location, on, earth, s, surface, terrain, and, oceans, it, is, directly, proportional, to, the, mass, of, air, over, that, location, for, numerical, reasons, atmospheric, models, such, as, general, circulation, models, gcms, usually, predict, the, nondimensional, logarithm, of, surface, pressure, the, average, value, of, surface, pressure, on, earth, is, 985, hpa, this, is, in, contrast, to, mean, sea, level, pressure, which, involves, the, extrapolation, of, pressure, to, sea, level, for, locations, above, or, below, sea, level, the, average, pressure, at, mean, sea, level, msl, in, the, international, standard, atmosphere, isa, is, 1, 013, 25, hpa, or, 1, atmosphere, atm, or, 29, 92, inches, of, mercury, pressure, p, mass, m, and, acceleration, due, to, gravity, g, are, related, by, p, f, a, m, g, a, where, a, is, the, surface, area, atmospheric, pressure, is, thus, proportional, to, the, weight, per, unit, area, of, the, atmospheric, mass, above, that, location, pressure, on, earth, varies, with, the, altitude, of, the, surface, so, air, pressure, on, mountains, is, usually, lower, than, air, pressure, at, sea, level, pressure, varies, smoothly, from, the, earth, s, surface, to, the, top, of, the, mesosphere, although, the, pressure, changes, with, the, weather, nasa, has, averaged, the, conditions, for, all, parts, of, the, earth, year, round, as, altitude, increases, atmospheric, pressure, decreases, one, can, calculate, the, atmospheric, pressure, at, a, given, altitude, temperature, and, humidity, also, affect, the, atmospheric, pressure, pressure, is, proportional, to, temperature, and, inversely, related, to, humidity, and, both, of, these, are, necessary, to, compute, an, accurate, figure, the, graph, on, the, right, above, was, developed, for, a, temperature, of, 15, c, and, a, relative, humidity, of, 0, at, low, altitudes, above, sea, level, the, pressure, decreases, by, about, 1, 2, kpa, 12, hpa, for, every, 100, metres, for, higher, altitudes, within, the, troposphere, the, following, equation, the, barometric, formula, relates, atmospheric, pressure, p, to, altitude, h, p, p,

pressure, shows, a, diurnal, or, semidiurnal, twice, daily, cycle, caused, by, global, atmospheric, tides, this, effect, is, strongest, in, tropical, zones, with, an, amplitude, of, a, few, hectopascals, and, almost, zero, in, polar, areas, these, variations, have, two, superimposed, cycles, a, circadian, 24, h, cycle, and, a, semi, circadian, 12, h, cycle, the, highest, adjusted, to, sea, level, barometric, pressure, ever, recorded, on, earth, above, 750, meters, was, 1, 084, 8, hpa, 32, 03, inhg, measured, in, tosontsengel, mongolia, on, 19, december, 2001, the, highest, adjusted, to, sea, level, barometric, pressure, ever, recorded, below, 750, meters, was, at, agata, in, evenk, autonomous, okrug, russia, 66, 53, n, 93, 28, e, elevation, 261, m, 856, ft, on, 31, december, 1968, of, 1, 083, 8, hpa, 32, 005, inhg, the, discrimination, is, due, to, the, problematic, assumptions, assuming, a, standard, lapse, rate, associated, with, reduction, of, sea, level, from, high, elevations, the, dead, sea, the, lowest, place, on, earth, at, 430, metres, 1, 410, ft, below, sea, level, has, a, correspondingly, high, typical, atmospheric, pressure, of, 1, 065, hpa, a, below, sea, level, surface, pressure, record, of, 1, 081, 8, hpa, 31, 95, inhg, was, set, on, 21, february, 1961, the, lowest, non, tornadic, atmospheric, pressure, ever, measured, was, 870, hpa, 0, 858, atm, 25, 69, inhg, set, on, 12, october, 1979, during, typhoon, tip, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, the, measurement, was, based, on, an, instrumental, observation, made, from, a, reconnaissance, aircraft, one, atmosphere, 101, 325, kpa, or, 14, 7, psi, is, also, the, pressure, caused, by, the, weight, of, a, column, of, freshwater, of, approximately, 10, 3, m, 33, 8, ft, thus, a, diver, 10, 3, m, underwater, experiences, a, pressure, of, about, 2, atmospheres, 1, atm, of, air, plus, 1, atm, of, water, conversely, 10, 3, m, is, the, maximum, height, to, which, water, can, be, raised, using, suction, under, standard, atmospheric, conditions, low, pressures, such, as, natural, gas, lines, are, sometimes, specified, in, inches, of, water, typically, written, as, w, c, water, column, gauge, or, w, g, inches, water, gauge, a, typical, gas, using, residential, appliance, in, the, us, is, rated, for, a, maximum, of, 1, 2, psi, 3, 4, kpa, 34, mbar, which, is, approximately, 14, w, g, similar, metric, units, with, a, wide, variety, of, names, and, notation, based, on, millimetres, centimetres, or, metres, are, now, less, commonly, used, pure, water, boils, at, 100, c, 212, f, at, earth, s, standard, atmospheric, pressure, the, boiling, point, is, the, temperature, at, which, the, vapour, pressure, is, equal, to, the, atmospheric, pressure, around, the, liquid, because, of, this, the, boiling, point, of, liquids, is, lower, at, lower, pressure, and, higher, at, higher, pressure, cooking, at, high, elevations, therefore, requires, adjustments, to, recipes, or, pressure, cooking, a, rough, approximation, of, elevation, can, be, obtained, by, measuring, the, temperature, at, which, water, boils, in, the, mid, 19th, century, this, method, was, used, by, explorers, conversely, if, one, wishes, to, evaporate, a, liquid, at, a, lower, temperature, for, example, in, distillation, the, atmospheric, pressure, may, be, lowered, by, using, a, vacuum, pump, as, in, a, rotary, evaporator, an, important, application, of, the, knowledge, that, atmospheric, pressure, varies, directly, with, altitude, was, in, determining, the, height, of, hills, and, mountains, thanks, to, reliable, pressure, measurement, devices, in, 1774, maskelyne, was, confirming, newton, s, theory, of, gravitation, at, and, on, schiehallion, mountain, in, scotland, and, he, needed, to, measure, elevations, on, the, mountain, s, sides, accurately, william, roy, using, barometric, pressure, was, able, to, confirm, maskelyne, s, height, determinations, the, agreement, being, to, be, within, one, meter, 3, 28, feet, this, method, became, and, continues, to, be, useful, for, survey, work, and, map, making
