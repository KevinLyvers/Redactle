asbestos, s, b, s, t, s, z, t, s, ass, bes, t, s, az, toss, is, a, naturally, occurring, fibrous, silicate, mineral, there, are, six, types, all, of, which, are, composed, of, long, and, thin, fibrous, crystals, each, fibre, particulate, with, length, substantially, greater, than, width, being, composed, of, many, microscopic, fibrils, that, can, be, released, into, the, atmosphere, by, abrasion, and, other, processes, inhalation, of, asbestos, fibres, can, lead, to, various, dangerous, lung, conditions, including, mesothelioma, asbestosis, and, lung, cancer, as, a, result, of, these, health, effects, asbestos, is, considered, a, serious, health, and, safety, hazard, archaeological, studies, have, found, evidence, of, asbestos, being, used, as, far, back, as, the, stone, age, to, strengthen, ceramic, pots, but, large, scale, mining, began, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, manufacturers, and, builders, began, using, asbestos, for, its, desirable, physical, properties, asbestos, is, an, excellent, thermal, and, electrical, insulator, and, is, highly, fire, resistant, so, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, very, commonly, used, around, the, world, as, a, building, material, particularly, for, its, fire, retardant, properties, until, its, adverse, effects, on, human, health, were, more, widely, recognized, and, acknowledged, in, the, 1970s, many, buildings, constructed, before, the, 1980s, contain, asbestos, the, use, of, asbestos, for, construction, and, fireproofing, has, been, made, illegal, in, many, countries, despite, this, around, 255, 000, people, are, thought, to, die, each, year, from, diseases, related, to, asbestos, exposure, in, part, this, is, because, many, older, buildings, still, contain, asbestos, in, addition, the, consequences, of, exposure, can, take, decades, to, arise, the, latency, period, from, exposure, until, the, diagnosis, of, negative, health, effects, is, typically, 20, years, the, most, common, diseases, associated, with, chronic, asbestos, exposure, are, asbestosis, scarring, of, the, lungs, due, to, asbestos, inhalation, and, mesothelioma, a, type, of, cancer, many, developing, countries, still, support, the, use, of, asbestos, as, a, building, material, and, mining, of, asbestos, is, ongoing, with, the, top, producer, russia, having, an, estimated, production, of, 790, 000, tonnes, in, 2020, the, word, asbestos, first, used, in, the, 1600s, ultimately, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, meaning, unquenchable, or, inextinguishable, the, name, reflects, use, of, the, substance, for, wicks, that, would, never, burn, up, it, was, adopted, into, english, via, the, old, french, abestos, which, got, the, word, from, greek, via, latin, but, in, the, original, greek, asbestos, actually, referred, to, quicklime, it, is, said, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, that, the, word, was, wrongly, used, by, pliny, for, what, we, now, call, asbestos, and, that, he, popularized, the, misnomer, asbestos, was, originally, referred, to, in, greek, as, amiantos, meaning, undefiled, because, when, thrown, into, a, fire, it, came, out, unmarked, amiantos, is, the, source, for, the, word, for, asbestos, in, many, languages, such, as, the, portuguese, amianto, and, the, french, amiante, it, had, also, been, called, amiant, in, english, in, the, early, 15th, century, but, this, usage, was, superseded, by, asbestos, the, word, is, pronounced, s, b, s, t, s, or, s, b, s, t, s, asbestos, has, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, to, create, flexible, objects, that, resist, fire, including, napkins, but, in, the, modern, era, companies, began, producing, consumer, goods, containing, asbestos, on, an, industrial, scale, today, the, risk, of, asbestos, has, been, recognized, the, use, of, asbestos, is, completely, banned, in, 66, countries, and, strictly, regulated, in, many, others, asbestos, use, dates, back, at, least, 4, 500, years, when, the, inhabitants, of, the, lake, juoj, rvi, region, in, east, finland, strengthened, earthenware, pots, and, cooking, utensils, with, the, asbestos, mineral, anthophyllite, archaeologists, call, this, style, of, pottery, asbestos, ceramic, some, archaeologists, believe, that, ancient, peoples, made, shrouds, of, asbestos, wherein, they, burned, the, bodies, of, their, kings, to, preserve, only, their, ashes, and, to, prevent, the, ashes, being, mixed, with, those, of, wood, or, other, combustible, materials, commonly, used, in, funeral, pyres, others, assert, that, these, peoples, used, asbestos, to, make, perpetual, wicks, for, sepulchral, or, other, lamps, a, famous, example, is, the, golden, lamp, asbestos, lychnis, which, the, sculptor, callimachus, made, for, the, erechtheion, in, more, recent, centuries, asbestos, was, indeed, used, for, this, purpose, a, once, purported, first, description, of, asbestos, occurs, in, theophrastus, on, stones, from, around, 300, bc, but, this, identification, has, been, refuted, in, both, modern, and, ancient, greek, the, usual, name, for, the, material, known, in, english, as, asbestos, is, amiantos, undefiled, pure, which, was, adapted, into, the, french, as, amiante, and, into, spanish, and, portuguese, as, amianto, in, modern, greek, the, word, or, stands, consistently, and, solely, for, lime, the, term, asbestos, is, traceable, to, roman, naturalist, pliny, the, elder, s, first, century, manuscript, natural, history, and, his, use, of, the, term, asbestinon, meaning, unquenchable, he, described, the, mineral, as, being, more, expensive, than, pearls, while, pliny, or, his, nephew, pliny, the, younger, is, popularly, credited, with, recognising, the, detrimental, effects, of, asbestos, on, human, beings, examination, of, the, primary, sources, reveals, no, support, for, either, claim, in, china, accounts, of, obtaining, huo, huan, bu, or, fire, laundered, cloth, certainly, dates, to, the, wei, dynasty, and, there, are, claims, they, were, known, as, early, as, in, the, zhou, dynasty, though, not, substantiated, except, in, writings, thought, to, date, much, later, see, huoshu, or, fire, rat, athanasius, of, alexandria, a, christian, bishop, living, in, 4th, century, egypt, references, asbestos, in, one, of, his, writings, around, the, year, 318, he, wrote, as, follows, the, natural, property, of, fire, is, to, burn, suppose, then, that, there, was, a, substance, such, as, the, indian, asbestos, is, said, to, be, which, had, no, fear, of, being, burnt, but, rather, displayed, the, impotence, of, the, fire, by, proving, itself, unburnable, if, anyone, doubted, the, truth, of, this, all, he, need, do, would, be, to, wrap, himself, up, in, the, substance, in, question, and, then, touch, the, fire, wealthy, persians, amazed, guests, by, cleaning, a, cloth, by, exposing, it, to, fire, for, example, according, to, tabari, one, of, the, curious, items, belonging, to, khosrow, ii, parviz, the, great, sassanian, king, r, 590, 628, was, a, napkin, persian, that, he, cleaned, simply, by, throwing, it, into, fire, such, cloth, is, believed, to, have, been, made, of, asbestos, imported, over, the, hindu, kush, according, to, biruni, in, his, book, gems, any, cloths, made, of, asbestos, persian, zarshost, were, called, shostakeh, persian, some, persians, believed, the, fiber, was, the, fur, of, an, animal, called, the, samandar, persian, which, lived, in, fire, and, died, when, exposed, to, water, this, was, where, the, former, belief, originated, that, the, salamander, could, tolerate, fire, charlemagne, the, first, holy, roman, emperor, 800, 814, is, also, said, to, have, possessed, such, a, tablecloth, marco, polo, recounts, having, been, shown, in, a, place, he, calls, ghinghin, talas, a, good, vein, from, which, the, cloth, which, we, call, of, salamander, which, cannot, be, burnt, if, it, is, thrown, into, the, fire, is, made, the, large, scale, asbestos, industry, began, in, the, mid, 19th, century, early, attempts, at, producing, asbestos, paper, and, cloth, in, italy, began, in, the, 1850s, but, were, unsuccessful, in, creating, a, market, for, such, products, canadian, samples, of, asbestos, were, displayed, in, london, in, 1862, and, the, first, companies, were, formed, in, england, and, scotland, to, exploit, this, resource, asbestos, was, first, used, in, the, manufacture, of, yarn, and, german, industrialist, louis, wertheim, adopted, this, process, in, his, factories, in, germany, in, 1871, the, patent, asbestos, manufacturing, company, was, established, in, glasgow, and, during, the, following, decades, the, clydebank, area, became, a, centre, for, the, nascent, industry, industrial, scale, mining, began, in, the, thetford, hills, quebec, from, the, 1870s, sir, william, edmond, logan, was, the, first, to, notice, the, large, deposits, of, chrysotile, in, the, hills, in, his, capacity, as, head, of, geological, survey, of, canada, samples, of, the, minerals, from, there, were, displayed, in, london, and, elicited, much, interest, with, the, opening, of, the, quebec, central, railway, in, 1876, mining, entrepreneurs, such, as, andrew, stuart, johnson, established, the, asbestos, industry, in, the, province, the, 50, ton, output, of, the, mines, in, 1878, rose, to, over, 10, 000, tonnes, in, the, 1890s, with, the, adoption, of, machine, technologies, and, expanded, production, for, a, long, time, the, world, s, largest, asbestos, mine, was, the, jeffrey, mine, in, the, town, of, asbestos, quebec, asbestos, production, began, in, the, urals, of, the, russian, empire, in, the, 1880s, and, the, alpine, regions, of, northern, italy, with, the, formation, in, turin, of, the, italo, english, pure, asbestos, company, in, 1876, although, this, was, soon, swamped, by, the, greater, production, levels, from, the, canadian, mines, mining, also, took, off, in, south, africa, from, 1893, under, the, aegis, of, the, british, businessman, francis, oates, the, director, of, the, de, beers, company, it, was, in, south, africa, that, the, production, of, amosite, began, in, 1910, the, u, s, asbestos, industry, had, an, early, start, in, 1858, when, fibrous, anthophyllite, was, mined, for, use, as, asbestos, insulation, by, the, johns, company, a, predecessor, to, the, current, johns, manville, at, a, quarry, at, ward, s, hill, on, staten, island, new, york, us, production, began, in, earnest, in, 1899, with, the, discovery, of, large, deposits, in, belvidere, mountain, in, vermont, the, use, of, asbestos, became, increasingly, widespread, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, its, diverse, applications, included, fire, retardant, coatings, concrete, bricks, pipes, and, fireplace, cement, heat, fire, and, acid, resistant, gaskets, pipe, insulation, ceiling, insulation, fireproof, drywall, flooring, roofing, lawn, furniture, and, drywall, joint, compound, in, 2011, it, was, reported, that, over, 50, of, uk, houses, still, contained, asbestos, despite, a, ban, on, asbestos, products, some, years, earlier, in, japan, particularly, after, world, war, ii, asbestos, was, used, in, the, manufacture, of, ammonium, sulfate, for, purposes, of, rice, production, sprayed, upon, the, ceilings, iron, skeletons, and, walls, of, railroad, cars, and, buildings, during, the, 1960s, and, used, for, energy, efficiency, reasons, as, well, production, of, asbestos, in, japan, peaked, in, 1974, and, went, through, ups, and, downs, until, about, 1990, when, production, began, to, drop, dramatically, the, 1898, annual, report, of, the, chief, inspector, of, factories, and, workshops, in, the, united, kingdom, noted, the, negative, health, effects, of, asbestos, the, contribution, having, been, made, by, lucy, deane, streatfeild, one, of, the, first, women, factory, inspectors, in, 1899, h, montague, murray, noted, the, negative, health, effects, of, asbestos, the, first, documented, death, related, to, asbestos, was, in, 1906, in, the, early, 1900s, researchers, began, to, notice, a, large, number, of, early, deaths, and, lung, problems, in, asbestos, mining, towns, the, first, such, study, was, conducted, by, murray, at, the, charing, cross, hospital, london, in, 1900, in, which, a, postmortem, investigation, discovered, asbestos, traces, in, the, lungs, of, a, young, man, who, had, died, from, pulmonary, fibrosis, after, having, worked, for, 14, years, in, an, asbestos, textile, factory, adelaide, anderson, the, inspector, of, factories, in, britain, included, asbestos, in, a, list, of, harmful, industrial, substances, in, 1902, similar, investigations, were, conducted, in, france, in, 1906, and, italy, in, 1908, the, first, diagnosis, of, asbestosis, was, made, in, the, uk, in, 1924, nellie, kershaw, was, employed, at, turner, brothers, asbestos, in, rochdale, greater, manchester, england, from, 1917, spinning, raw, asbestos, fibre, into, yarn, her, death, in, 1924, led, to, a, formal, inquest, pathologist, william, edmund, cooke, testified, that, his, examination, of, the, lungs, indicated, old, scarring, indicative, of, a, previous, healed, tuberculosis, infection, and, extensive, fibrosis, in, which, were, visible, particles, of, mineral, matter, of, various, shapes, but, the, large, majority, have, sharp, angles, having, compared, these, particles, with, samples, of, asbestos, dust, provided, by, s, a, henry, his, majesty, s, medical, inspector, of, factories, cooke, concluded, that, they, originated, from, asbestos, and, were, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, the, primary, cause, of, the, fibrosis, of, the, lungs, and, therefore, of, death, as, a, result, of, cooke, s, paper, parliament, commissioned, an, inquiry, into, the, effects, of, asbestos, dust, by, e, r, a, merewether, medical, inspector, of, factories, and, c, w, price, a, factory, inspector, and, pioneer, of, dust, monitoring, and, control, their, subsequent, report, occurrence, of, pulmonary, fibrosis, other, pulmonary, affections, in, asbestos, workers, was, presented, to, parliament, on, 24, march, 1930, it, concluded, that, the, development, of, asbestosis, was, irrefutably, linked, to, the, prolonged, inhalation, of, asbestos, dust, and, included, the, first, health, study, of, asbestos, workers, which, found, that, 66, of, those, employed, for, 20, years, or, more, suffered, from, asbestosis, the, report, led, to, the, publication, of, the, first, asbestos, industry, regulations, in, 1931, which, came, into, effect, on, 1, march, 1932, these, rules, regulated, ventilation, and, made, asbestosis, an, excusable, work, related, disease, the, term, mesothelioma, was, first, used, in, medical, literature, in, 1931, its, association, with, asbestos, was, first, noted, sometime, in, the, 1940s, similar, legislation, followed, in, the, u, s, about, ten, years, later, approximately, 100, 000, people, in, the, united, states, have, died, or, are, terminally, ill, from, asbestos, exposure, related, to, shipbuilding, in, the, hampton, roads, area, a, shipbuilding, center, mesothelioma, occurrence, is, seven, times, the, national, rate, thousands, of, tons, of, asbestos, were, used, in, world, war, ii, ships, to, insulate, piping, boilers, steam, engines, and, steam, turbines, there, were, approximately, 4, 3, million, shipyard, workers, in, the, united, states, during, the, war, for, every, 1, 000, workers, about, 14, died, of, mesothelioma, and, an, unknown, number, died, of, asbestosis, the, united, states, government, and, the, asbestos, industry, have, been, criticized, for, not, acting, quickly, enough, to, inform, the, public, of, dangers, and, to, reduce, public, exposure, in, the, late, 1970s, court, documents, proved, that, asbestos, industry, officials, knew, of, asbestos, dangers, since, the, 1930s, and, had, concealed, them, from, the, public, in, australia, asbestos, was, widely, used, in, construction, and, other, industries, between, 1946, and, 1980, from, the, 1970s, there, was, increasing, concern, about, the, dangers, of, asbestos, and, its, use, was, phased, out, and, following, community, and, union, campaigning, its, use, was, phased, out, with, mining, having, ceased, in, 1983, the, use, of, asbestos, was, phased, out, in, 1989, and, banned, entirely, in, december, 2003, the, dangers, of, asbestos, are, now, well, known, in, australia, and, there, is, help, and, support, for, those, suffering, from, asbestosis, or, mesothelioma, serpentine, minerals, have, a, sheet, or, layered, structure, chrysotile, commonly, known, as, white, asbestos, is, the, only, asbestos, mineral, in, the, serpentine, group, in, the, united, states, chrysotile, has, been, the, most, commonly, used, type, of, asbestos, according, to, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, epa, asbestos, building, inspectors, manual, chrysotile, accounts, for, approximately, 95, of, asbestos, found, in, buildings, in, the, united, states, chrysotile, is, often, present, in, a, wide, variety, of, products, and, materials, including, in, the, european, union, and, australia, it, has, been, banned, as, a, potential, health, hazard, and, is, no, longer, used, at, all, amphiboles, including, amosite, brown, asbestos, and, crocidolite, blue, asbestos, were, formerly, used, in, many, products, until, the, early, 1980s, tremolite, asbestos, constituted, a, contaminant, of, many, if, not, all, naturally, occurring, chrysotile, deposits, the, use, of, all, types, of, asbestos, in, the, amphibole, group, was, banned, in, much, of, the, western, world, by, the, mid, 1980s, and, in, japan, by, 1995, some, products, that, included, amphibole, types, of, asbestos, included, the, following, cigarette, manufacturer, lorillard, kent, s, filtered, cigarette, used, crocidolite, asbestos, in, its, micronite, filter, from, 1952, to, 1956, while, mostly, chrysotile, asbestos, fibers, were, once, used, in, automobile, brake, pads, shoes, and, clutch, discs, contaminants, of, amphiboles, were, present, since, approximately, the, mid, 1990s, brake, pads, new, or, replacement, have, been, manufactured, instead, with, linings, made, of, ceramic, carbon, metallic, and, aramid, fiber, twaron, or, kevlar, the, same, material, used, in, bulletproof, vests, artificial, christmas, snow, known, as, flocking, was, previously, made, with, asbestos, it, was, used, as, an, effect, in, films, including, the, wizard, of, oz, and, department, store, window, displays, and, it, was, marketed, for, use, in, private, homes, under, brand, names, that, included, pure, white, snow, drift, and, white, magic, the, potential, for, use, of, asbestos, to, mitigate, climate, change, has, been, raised, although, the, adverse, aspects, of, mining, of, minerals, including, health, effects, must, be, taken, into, account, exploration, of, the, use, of, mineral, wastes, to, sequester, carbon, is, being, studied, the, use, of, mining, waste, materials, from, nickel, copper, diamond, and, platinum, mines, have, the, potential, as, well, but, asbestos, may, have, the, greatest, potential, and, is, the, subject, of, research, now, in, progress, in, an, emerging, field, of, scientific, study, to, examine, it, the, most, common, type, of, asbestos, chrysotile, chemically, reacts, with, co, 2, to, produce, ecologically, stable, magnesium, carbonate, chrysotile, like, all, types, of, asbestos, has, a, large, surface, area, that, provides, more, places, for, chemical, reactions, to, occur, compared, to, most, other, naturally, occurring, materials, the, use, of, asbestos, in, new, construction, projects, has, been, banned, for, health, and, safety, reasons, in, many, developed, countries, or, regions, including, the, european, union, the, united, kingdom, australia, hong, kong, japan, and, new, zealand, a, notable, exception, is, the, united, states, where, asbestos, continues, to, be, used, in, construction, such, as, cement, asbestos, pipes, the, 5th, circuit, court, prevented, the, epa, from, banning, asbestos, in, 1991, because, epa, research, showed, the, ban, would, cost, between, us, 450, and, 800, million, while, only, saving, around, 200, lives, in, a, 13, year, timeframe, and, that, the, epa, did, not, provide, adequate, evidence, for, the, safety, of, alternative, products, until, the, mid, 1980s, small, amounts, of, white, asbestos, were, used, in, the, manufacture, of, artex, a, decorative, stipple, finish, however, some, of, the, lesser, known, suppliers, of, artex, type, materials, were, still, adding, white, asbestos, until, 1999, before, the, ban, asbestos, was, widely, used, in, the, construction, industry, in, thousands, of, materials, some, are, judged, to, be, more, dangerous, than, others, due, to, the, amount, of, asbestos, and, the, material, s, friable, nature, sprayed, coatings, pipe, insulation, and, asbestos, insulating, board, aib, are, thought, to, be, the, most, dangerous, due, to, their, high, content, of, asbestos, and, friable, nature, many, older, buildings, built, before, the, late, 1990s, contain, asbestos, in, the, united, states, there, is, a, minimum, standard, for, asbestos, surveys, as, described, by, astm, standard, e, 2356, 18, in, the, uk, the, health, and, safety, executive, have, issued, guidance, called, hsg264, describing, how, surveys, should, be, completed, although, other, methods, can, be, used, if, they, can, demonstrate, they, have, met, the, regulations, by, other, means, the, epa, includes, some, but, not, all, asbestos, contaminated, facilities, on, the, superfund, national, priorities, list, npl, renovation, and, demolition, of, asbestos, contaminated, buildings, are, subject, to, epa, neshap, and, osha, regulations, asbestos, is, not, a, material, covered, under, cercla, s, innocent, purchaser, defense, in, the, uk, the, removal, and, disposal, of, asbestos, and, substances, containing, it, are, covered, by, the, control, of, asbestos, regulations, 2006, u, s, asbestos, consumption, hit, a, peak, of, 804, 000, tons, in, 1973, world, asbestos, demand, peaked, around, 1977, with, 25, countries, producing, nearly, 4, 8, million, metric, tons, annually, in, older, buildings, e, g, those, built, before, 1999, in, the, uk, before, white, asbestos, was, banned, asbestos, may, still, be, present, in, some, areas, being, aware, of, asbestos, locations, reduces, the, risk, of, disturbing, asbestos, removal, of, asbestos, building, components, can, also, remove, the, fire, protection, they, provide, therefore, fire, protection, substitutes, are, required, for, proper, fire, protection, that, the, asbestos, originally, provided, some, countries, such, as, india, indonesia, china, and, russia, have, continued, widespread, use, of, asbestos, the, most, common, is, corrugated, asbestos, cement, sheets, or, a, c, sheets, for, roofing, and, sidewalls, millions, of, homes, factories, schools, or, sheds, and, shelters, continue, to, use, asbestos, cutting, these, sheets, to, size, and, drilling, holes, to, receive, j, bolts, to, help, secure, the, sheets, to, roof, framing, is, done, on, site, there, has, been, no, significant, change, in, production, and, use, of, a, c, sheets, in, developing, countries, following, the, widespread, restrictions, in, developed, nations, as, new, york, city, s, world, trade, center, collapsed, following, the, september, 11, attacks, lower, manhattan, was, blanketed, in, a, mixture, of, building, debris, and, combustible, materials, this, complex, mixture, gave, rise, to, the, concern, that, thousands, of, residents, and, workers, in, the, area, would, be, exposed, to, known, hazards, in, the, air, and, dust, such, as, asbestos, lead, glass, fibers, and, pulverized, concrete, more, than, 1, 000, tons, of, asbestos, are, thought, to, have, been, released, into, the, air, following, the, buildings, destruction, inhalation, of, a, mixture, of, asbestos, and, other, toxicants, is, thought, to, be, linked, to, the, unusually, high, death, rate, from, cancer, of, emergency, service, workers, since, the, disaster, thousands, more, are, now, thought, to, be, at, risk, of, developing, cancer, due, to, this, exposure, with, those, who, have, died, so, far, being, only, the, tip, of, the, iceberg, in, may, 2002, after, numerous, cleanup, dust, collection, and, air, monitoring, activities, were, conducted, outdoors, by, epa, other, federal, agencies, new, york, city, and, the, state, of, new, york, new, york, city, formally, requested, federal, assistance, to, clean, and, test, residences,

states, w, r, grace, and, company, s, loose, fill, vermiculite, was, marketed, as, zonolite, but, was, also, used, in, sprayed, on, products, such, as, monokote, in, 1999, the, epa, began, cleanup, efforts, in, libby, and, now, the, area, is, a, superfund, cleanup, area, the, epa, has, determined, that, harmful, asbestos, is, released, from, the, mine, as, well, as, through, other, activities, that, disturb, soil, in, the, area, talc, can, sometimes, be, contaminated, with, asbestos, due, to, the, proximity, of, asbestos, ore, usually, tremolite, in, underground, talc, deposits, by, 1973, us, federal, law, required, all, talc, products, to, be, asbestos, free, separating, cosmetic, grade, talc, e, g, talcum, powder, from, industrial, grade, talc, often, used, in, friction, products, has, largely, eliminated, this, issue, for, consumers, cosmetics, companies, including, johnson, johnson, have, known, since, the, 1950s, that, talc, products, could, be, contaminated, with, asbestos, in, 2020, laboratory, tests, of, 21, talc, based, cosmetics, products, found, that, 15, percent, were, contaminated, with, asbestos, in, july, 2024, the, world, health, organization, who, heightened, its, health, warning, about, talc, exposure, in, a, study, published, in, the, lancet, the, who, changed, its, classification, of, talc, from, possibly, carcinogenic, to, probably, carcinogenic, in, 2000, tests, in, a, certified, asbestos, testing, laboratory, found, the, tremolite, form, of, amphibole, asbestos, used, to, be, found, in, three, out, of, eight, popular, brands, of, children, s,

association, which, tested, the, safety, of, crayons, on, behalf, of, the, makers, initially, insisted, the, test, results, must, have, been, incorrect, although, they, later, said, they, do, not, test, for, asbestos, in, may, 2000, crayola, said, tests, by, richard, lee, a, materials, analyst, whose, testimony, on, behalf, of, the, asbestos, industry, has, been, accepted, in, lawsuits, over, 250, times, found, its, crayons, tested, negative, for, asbestos, in, spite, of, that, in, june, 2000, binney, smith, the, maker, of, crayola, and, the, other, makers, agreed, to, stop, using, talc, in, their, products, and, changed, their, product, formulations, in, the, united, states, the, mining, company, r, t, vanderbilt, co, of, gouverneur, new, york, which, supplied, the, talc, to, the, crayon, makers, states, that, to, the, best, of, our, knowledge, and, belief, there, had, never, been, any, asbestos, related, disease, among, the, company, s, workers, however, media, reports, claim, that, the, united, states, mine, safety, and, health, administration, msha, had, found, asbestos, in, four, talc, samples, tested, in, 2000, the, assistant, secretary, for, mine, safety, and, health, subsequently, wrote, to, the, news, reporter, stating, that, in, fact, the, abbreviation, nd, non, detect, in, the, laboratory, report, indicates, no, asbestos, fibers, actually, were, found, in, the, samples, multiple, studies, by, mineral, chemists, cell, biologists, and, toxicologists, between, 1970, and, 2000, found, neither, samples, of, asbestos, in, talc, products, nor, symptoms, of, asbestos, exposure, among, workers, dealing, with, talc, but, more, recent, work, has, rejected, these, conclusions, in, favor, of, same, as, asbestos, risk, on, 12, july, 2018, a, missouri, jury, ordered, johnson, johnson, to, pay, a, record, 4, 69, billion, to, 22, women, who, alleged, the, company, s, talc, based, products, including, its, baby, powder, contain, asbestos, and, caused, them, to, develop, ovarian, cancer, six, mineral, types, are, defined, by, the, epa, as, asbestos, including, those, belonging, to, the, serpentine, class, and, those, belonging, to, the, amphibole, class,

asbestiform, rather, than, asbestos, although, the, u, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, not, included, them, in, the, asbestos, standard, niosh, and, the, american, thoracic, society, have, recommended, them, for, inclusion, as, regulated, materials, because, they, may, also, be, hazardous, to, health, mountain, leather, is, an, old, fashioned, term, for, flexible, sheet, like, natural, formations, of, asbestiform, minerals, which, resemble, leather, asbestos, containing, minerals, known, to, form, mountain, leather, include, actinolite, sepiolite, and, tremolite, in, 2017, 1, 3, million, tonnes, of, asbestos, were, mined, worldwide, russia, was, the, largest, producer, with, 53, of, the, world, total, followed, by, kazakhstan, 16, china, 15, and, brazil, 11, 5, asia, consumes, some, 70, of, the, asbestos, produced, in, the, world, with, china, india, and, indonesia, the, largest, consumers, in, 2009, about, 9, of, the, world, s, asbestos, production, was, mined, in, canada, in, late, 2011, canada, s, remaining, two, asbestos, mines, both, located, in, quebec, halted, operations, in, september, 2012, the, quebec, government, halted, asbestos, mining, the, most, common, diseases, associated, with, chronic, asbestos, exposure, are, asbestosis, scarring, of, the, lungs, due, to, asbestos, inhalation, and, mesothelioma, cancer, associated, with, asbestos, mesothelioma, is, an, aggressive, form, of, cancer, and, often, leads, to, a, life, expectancy, of, less, than, 12, months, after, diagnosis, all, types, of, asbestos, fibers, are, known, to, represent, serious, health, hazards, in, humans, and, animals, amosite, and, crocidolite, are, considered, the, most, hazardous, asbestos, fiber, types, however, chrysotile, asbestos, has, also, produced, tumors, in, animals, and, is, a, recognized, cause, of, asbestosis, and, malignant, mesothelioma, in, humans, and, mesothelioma, has, been, observed, in, people, who, were, occupationally, exposed, to, chrysotile, family, members, of, the, occupationally, exposed, and, residents, who, lived, close, to, asbestos, factories, and, mines, during, the, 1980s, and, again, in, the, 1990s, the, asbestos, industry, suggested, at, times, that, the, process, of, making, asbestos, cement, could, neutralize, the, asbestos, either, via, chemical, processes, or, by, causing, the, cement, to, attach, to, the, fibers, and, changing, their, physical, size, subsequent, studies, showed, that, this, was, untrue, and, that, decades, old, asbestos, cement, when, broken, releases, asbestos, fibers, identical, to, those, found, in, nature, with, no, detectable, alteration, exposure, to, asbestos, in, the, form, of, fibers, is, always, considered, dangerous, working, with, or, exposure, to, material, that, is, friable, or, materials, or, works, that, could, cause, the, release, of, loose, asbestos, fibers, is, considered, high, risk, in, general, people, who, become, ill, from, inhaling, asbestos, have, been, regularly, exposed, in, a, job, where, they, worked, directly, with, the, material, the, us, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, standards, to, protect, workers, from, the, hazards, of, exposure, to, asbestos, in, the, workplace, the, permissible, exposure, limit, for, asbestos, is, 0, 1, fiber, per, cubic, centimeter, of, air, as, an, eight, hour, time, weighted, average, with, an, excursion, limit, of, 1, 0, asbestos, fibers, per, cubic, centimeter, over, a, 30, minute, period, worldwide, 66, countries, and, territories, including, all, those, in, the, european, union, have, banned, the, use, of, asbestos, exemptions, for, minor, uses, are, permitted, in, some, countries, listed, however, all, countries, listed, must, have, banned, the, use, of, all, types, of, asbestos, the, use, of, crocidolite, blue, asbestos, was, banned, in, 1967, while, the, use, of, amosite, brown, asbestos, continued, in, the, construction, industry, until, the, mid, 1980s, it, was, finally, banned, from, building, products, in, 1989, though, it, remained, in, gaskets, and, brake, linings, until, 31, december, 2003, and, cannot, be, imported, used, or, recycled, asbestos, continues, to, be, a, problem, in, australia, two, out, of, three, homes, in, australia, built, between, world, war, ii, and, the, early, 1980s, still, contain, asbestos, the, united, services, union, representing, workers, tasked, with, modifying, electrical, meter, boxes, at, residences, stated, that, workers, should, refuse, to, do, this, work, until, the, boxes, have, been, inspected, for, asbestos, and, the, head, of, the, australian, council, of, trade, unions, actu, has, called, on, the, government, to, protect, its, citizens, by, ridding, the, country, of, asbestos, by, 2030, handlers, of, asbestos, materials, must, have, a, b, class, license, for, bonded, asbestos, and, an, a, class, license, for, friable, asbestos, the, town, of, wittenoom, in, western, australia, was, built, around, a, blue, asbestos, mine, the, entire, town, continues, to, be, contaminated, and, has, been, disincorporated, allowing, local, authorities, to, remove, references, to, wittenoom, from, maps, and, road, signs, in, january, 2024, asbestos, was, found, in, garden, mulch, supplied, to, dozens, of, sites, including, parks, playgrounds, and, schools, across, sydney, triggering, the, sydney, asbestos, mulch, crisis, as, of, december, 31, 2018, it, is, illegal, to, import, manufacture, sell, trade, or, use, products, made, from, asbestos, there, are, exemptions, for, its, use, in, the, chloralkali, industry, the, military, nuclear, facilities, and, for, magnesium, extraction, from, asbestos, mining, residues, on, 23, july, 2000, supreme, council, of, environmental, protection, of, iran, banned, any, use, of, asbestos, on, a, note, it, states, that, after, 44, years, if, there, is, no, replacement, technically, economically, or, financially, the, law, is, appealable, and, will, be, subject, to, review, on, 22, november, 2011, iran, s, environmental, protection, organization, banned, use, of, asbestos, completely, it, also, banned, all, imports, and, exports, of, asbestos, on, 9, october, 2011, supreme, council, of, environmental, protection, of, iran, confirmed, the, new, law, and, publicly, announced, it, updating, and, replacing, the, previous, law, revelations, that, hundreds, of, workers, had, died, in, japan, over, the, previous, few, decades, from, diseases, related, to, asbestos, sparked, a, scandal, in, mid, 2005, tokyo, had, in, 1971, ordered, companies, handling, asbestos, to, install, ventilators, and, check, health, regularly, however, the, japanese, government, did, not, ban, crocidolite, and, amosite, until, 1995, and, a, near, complete, ban, with, a, few, exceptions, on, asbestos, was, implemented, in, 2006, with, the, remaining, exceptions, being, removed, in, march, 2012, for, a, full, fledged, ban, in, 1984, the, import, of, raw, amphibole, blue, and, brown, asbestos, into, new, zealand, was, banned, in, 2002, the, import, of, chrysotile, white, asbestos, was, also, banned, in, 2015, the, government, announced, that, the, importation, of, asbestos, would, be, completely, banned, with, very, limited, exceptions, expected, to, be, applied, to, replacement, parts, for, older, machines, that, would, be, reviewed, on, a, case, by, case, basis, north, west, of, nelson, in, the, upper, takaka, valley, is, new, zealand, s, only, commercially, harvested, asbestos, mine, a, low, grade, chrysotile, was, mined, here, from, 1908, to, 1917, but, only, 100, tons, were, washed, and, taken, out, by, packhorse, a, new, power, scheme, enabled, work, to, renew, and, between, 1940, and, 1949, 40, tons, a, month, was, mined, by, the, hume, company, this, continued, to, 1964, when, due, to, the, short, length, of, its, fibre, the, limited, commercial, viability, forced, mining, to, cease, in, may, 1997, the, manufacture, and, use, of, crocidolite, and, amosite, commonly, known, as, blue, and, brown, asbestos, were, fully, banned, in, south, korea, in, january, 2009, a, full, fledged, ban, on, all, types, of, asbestos, occurred, when, the, government, banned, the, manufacture, import, sale, storage, transport, or, use, of, asbestos, or, any, substance, containing, more, than, 0, 1, of, asbestos, in, 2011, south, korea, became, the, world, s, sixth, country, to, enact, an, asbestos, harm, aid, act, which, entitles, any, korean, citizen, to, free, lifetime, medical, care, as, well, as, monthly, income, from, the, government, if, they, are, diagnosed, with, an, asbestos, related, disease, in, the, united, kingdom, blue, and, brown, asbestos, materials, were, banned, outright, in, 1985, while, the, import, sale, and, secondhand, reuse, of, white, asbestos, was, outlawed, in, 1999, the, 2012, control, of, asbestos, regulations, updating, and, replacing, the, previous, 2006, law, state, that, owners, of, non, domestic, buildings, e, g, factories, and, offices, have, a, duty, to, manage, asbestos, on, the, premises, by, making, themselves, aware, of, its, presence, and, ensuring, the, material, does, not, deteriorate, removing, it, if, necessary, employers, e, g, construction, companies, whose, operatives, may, come, into, contact, with, asbestos, must, also, provide, annual, asbestos, training, to, their, workers, prior, to, 2024, the, united, states, remained, one, of, the, few, developed, countries, to, not, completely, ban, asbestos, some, american, workers, at, chlorine, plants, frequently, came, in, contact, with, the, substance, and, osha, exempted, these, plants, from, random, inspections, through, the, voluntary, protection, program, in, 1989, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, issued, the, asbestos, ban, and, phase, out, rule, but, in, 1991, asbestos, industry, supporters, challenged, and, overturned, the, ban, in, a, landmark, lawsuit, corrosion, proof, fittings, v, the, environmental, protection, agency, although, the, case, resulted, in, several, small, victories, for, asbestos, regulation, the, epa, ultimately, did, not, put, an, end, to, asbestos, use, the, ruling, left, many, consumer, products, that, can, still, legally, contain, trace, amounts, of, asbestos, six, categories, of, asbestos, containing, products, are, however, banned, corrugated, paper, rollboard, commercial, paper, specialty, paper, flooring, felt, and, any, new, uses, of, asbestos, the, clean, air, act, also, bans, asbestos, pipe, insulation, and, asbestos, block, insulation, on, components, such, as, boilers, and, hot, water, tanks, and, spray, applied, surfacing, asbestos, containing, materials, the, consumer, product, safety, act, bans, asbestos, in, artificial, fireplace, embers, and, wall, patching, compounds, the, food, and, drug, administration, bans, asbestos, containing, filters, in, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, processing, and, packing, in, 2014, the, state, of, washington, banned, asbestos, in, automotive, brakes, in, 2024, the, epa, announced, a, new, rule, to, ban, all, ongoing, uses, of, asbestos, by, 2037, the, rule, is, the, first, to, be, implemented, under, 2016, amendments, to, the, toxic, substances, control, act, since, 1970, as, a, result, of, increased, regulation, of, asbestos, in, europe, and, in, the, united, states, there, was, a, massive, transfer, of, asbestos, processing, enterprises, to, mexico, asbestos, is, used, in, many, products, roofing, boilers, pipes, brakes, and, wires, produced, by, over, 2, 000, mexican, companies, many, of, them, subsidiaries, or, subcontractors, of, us, companies, and, sold, throughout, the, americas, in, 2000, 58, of, mexican, asbestos, containing, exports, went, to, the, united, states, and, 40, to, central, american, countries, and, cuba, in, vietnam, chrysotile, asbestos, is, not, banned, and, is, still, widely, used, amphibole, asbestos, is, banned, from, trade, and, use, vietnam, is, one, of, the, top, 10, asbestos, users, in, the, world, with, an, annual, import, volume, of, about, 65, 000, 70, 000, tons, of, chrysotile, about, 90, of, the, imported, asbestos, is, used, to, produce, about, 100, million, m, 2, of, cement, roofing, sheets, asbestos, cement, according, to, one, study, among, 300, families, in, yen, bai, thanh, hoa, 85, of, households, use, asbestos, roofing, sheets, but, only, 5, know, about, the, negative, health, effects, the, master, plan, for, construction, materials, development, to, 2020, with, orientation, to, 2030, submitted, by, the, ministry, of, construction, to, the, government, in, january, 2014, still, suggests, continued, use, of, chrysotile, for, a, long, time, fiberglass, insulation, was, invented, in, 1938, and, is, now, the, most, commonly, used, type, of, insulation, material, the, safety, of, this, material, has, also, been, called, into, question, due, to, similarities, in, material, structure, however, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, removed, fiberglass, from, its, list, of, possible, human, carcinogens, in, 2001, a, scientific, review, article, from, 2011, claimed, epidemiology, data, was, inconsistent, and, concluded, that, the, iarc, s, decision, to, downgrade, the, carcinogenic, potential, of, fiberglass, was, valid, although, this, study, was, funded, by, a, sponsored, research, contract, from, the, north, american, insulation, manufacturer, s, association, in, 1978, a, highly, texturized, fiberglass, fabric, was, invented, by, bal, dixit, called, zetex, this, fabric, is, lighter, than, asbestos, but, offers, the, same, bulk, thickness, hand, feel, and, abrasion, resistance, as, asbestos, the, fiberglass, was, texturized, to, eliminate, some, of, the, problems, that, arise, with, fiberglass, such, as, poor, abrasion, resistance, and, poor, seam, strength, in, europe, mineral, wool, and, glass, wool, are, the, main, insulators, in, houses, many, companies, that, produced, asbestos, cement, products, that, were, reinforced, with, asbestos, fibers, have, developed, products, incorporating, organic, fibers, one, such, product, was, known, as, eternit, and, another, everite, now, use, nutec, fibers, which, consist, of, organic, fibers, portland, cement, and, silica, cement, bonded, wood, fiber, is, another, substitute, stone, fibers, are, used, in, gaskets, and, friction, materials, another, potential, fiber, is, polybenzimidazole, or, pbi, fiber, polybenzimidazole, fiber, is, a, synthetic, fiber, with, a, high, melting, point, of, 760, c, 1, 400, f, that, also, does, not, ignite, because, of, its, exceptional, thermal, and, chemical, stability, it, is, often, used, by, fire, departments, and, space, agencies, in, most, developed, countries, asbestos, is, typically, disposed, of, as, hazardous, waste, in, designated, landfill, sites, the, demolition, of, buildings, containing, large, amounts, of, asbestos, based, materials, pose, particular, problems, for, builders, and, property, developers, such, buildings, often, have, to, be, deconstructed, piece, by, piece, or, the, asbestos, has, to, be, painstakingly, removed, before, the, structure, can, be, razed, by, mechanical, or, explosive, means, one, such, example, is, the, red, road, flats, in, glasgow, scotland, which, used, huge, amounts, of, asbestos, cement, board, for, wall, panelling, british, health, and, safety, regulations, stipulate, that, asbestos, material, has, to, be, removed, in, specially, adapted, vehicles, and, taken, to, a, landfill, site, with, an, appropriate, permit, to, accept, asbestos, via, an, approved, route, at, certain, times, of, the, day, in, the, united, states, the, epa, governs, the, removal, and, disposal, of, asbestos, strictly, companies, that, remove, asbestos, must, comply, with, epa, licensing, these, companies, are, called, epa, licensed, asbestos, contractors, anytime, one, of, these, asbestos, contractors, performs, work, a, test, consultant, has, to, conduct, strict, testing, to, ensure, the, asbestos, is, completely, removed, asbestos, can, be, destroyed, by, ultra, high, temperature, incineration, and, plasma, melting, process, a, process, of, thermal, decomposition, at, 1, 000, 1, 250, c, 1, 800, 2, 300, f, produces, a, mixture, of, non, hazardous, silicon, based, wastes, and, at, temperatures, above, 1, 250, c, 2, 300, f, it, produces, silicate, glass, microwave, thermal, treatment, can, be, used, in, an, industrial, manufacturing, process, to, transform, asbestos, and, asbestos, containing, waste, into, porcelain, stoneware, tiles, porous, single, fired, wall, tiles, and, ceramic, bricks, the, combination, of, oxalic, acid, with, ultrasound, fully, degrades, chrysotile, asbestos, fibers
