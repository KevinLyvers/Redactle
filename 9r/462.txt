nitric, acid, is, an, inorganic, compound, with, the, formula, h, n, o, 3, it, is, a, highly, corrosive, mineral, acid, the, compound, is, colorless, but, samples, tend, to, acquire, a, yellow, cast, over, time, due, to, decomposition, into, oxides, of, nitrogen, most, commercially, available, nitric, acid, has, a, concentration, of, 68, in, water, when, the, solution, contains, more, than, 86, hno, 3, it, is, referred, to, as, fuming, nitric, acid, depending, on, the, amount, of, nitrogen, dioxide, present, fuming, nitric, acid, is, further, characterized, as, red, fuming, nitric, acid, at, concentrations, above, 86, or, white, fuming, nitric, acid, at, concentrations, above, 95, nitric, acid, is, the, primary, reagent, used, for, nitration, the, addition, of, a, nitro, group, typically, to, an, organic, molecule, while, some, resulting, nitro, compounds, are, shock, and, thermally, sensitive, explosives, a, few, are, stable, enough, to, be, used, in, munitions, and, demolition, while, others, are, still, more, stable, and, used, as, pigments, in, inks, and, dyes, nitric, acid, is, also, commonly, used, as, a, strong, oxidizing, agent, the, discovery, of, mineral, acids, such, as, nitric, acid, is, generally, believed, to, go, back, to, 13th, century, european, alchemy, the, conventional, view, is, that, nitric, acid, was, first, described, in, pseudo, geber, s, de, inventione, veritatis, on, the, discovery, of, truth, after, c, 1300, however, according, to, eric, john, holmyard, and, ahmad, y, al, hassan, the, nitric, acid, also, occurs, in, various, earlier, arabic, works, such, as, the, und, q, al, ikma, chest, of, wisdom, attributed, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, 8th, century, or, the, ta, w, dh, al, kim, attributed, to, the, fatimid, caliph, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, 985, 1021, the, recipe, in, the, und, q, al, ikma, attributed, to, jabir, has, been, translated, as, follows, take, five, parts, of, pure, flowers, of, nitre, three, parts, of, cyprus, vitriol, and, two, parts, of, yemen, alum, powder, them, well, separately, until, they, are, like, dust, and, then, place, them, in, a, flask, plug, the, latter, with, a, palm, fibre, and, attach, a, glass, receiver, to, it, then, invert, the, apparatus, and, heat, the, upper, portion, i, e, the, flask, containing, the, mixture, with, a, gentle, fire, there, will, flow, down, by, reason, of, the, heat, an, oil, like, cow, s, butter, nitric, acid, is, also, found, in, post, 1300, works, falsely, attributed, to, albert, the, great, and, ramon, llull, both, 13th, century, these, works, describe, the, distillation, of, a, mixture, containing, niter, and, green, vitriol, which, they, call, eau, forte, aqua, fortis, in, the, 17th, century, johann, rudolf, glauber, devised, a, process, to, obtain, nitric, acid, by, distilling, potassium, nitrate, with, sulfuric, acid, in, 1776, antoine, lavoisier, cited, joseph, priestley, s, work, to, point, out, that, it, can, be, converted, from, nitric, oxide, which, he, calls, nitrous, air, combined, with, an, approximately, equal, volume, of, the, purest, part, of, common, air, and, with, a, considerable, quantity, of, water, in, 1785, henry, cavendish, determined, its, precise, composition, and, showed, that, it, could, be, synthesized, by, passing, a, stream, of, electric, sparks, through, moist, air, in, 1806, humphry, davy, reported, the, results, of, extensive, distilled, water, electrolysis, experiments, concluding, that, nitric, acid, was, produced, at, the, anode, from, dissolved, atmospheric, nitrogen, gas, he, used, a, high, voltage, battery, and, non, reactive, electrodes, and, vessels, such, as, gold, electrode, cones, that, doubled, as, vessels, bridged, by, damp, asbestos, the, industrial, production, of, nitric, acid, from, atmospheric, air, began, in, 1905, with, the, birkeland, eyde, process, also, known, as, the, arc, process, this, process, is, based, upon, the, oxidation, of, atmospheric, nitrogen, by, atmospheric, oxygen, to, nitric, oxide, with, a, very, high, temperature, electric, arc, yields, of, up, to, approximately, 4, 5, nitric, oxide, were, obtained, at, 3000, c, and, less, at, lower, temperatures, the, nitric, oxide, was, cooled, and, oxidized, by, the, remaining, atmospheric, oxygen, to, nitrogen, dioxide, and, this, was, subsequently, absorbed, in, water, in, a, series, of, packed, column, or, plate, column, absorption, towers, to, produce, dilute, nitric, acid, the, first, towers, bubbled, the, nitrogen, dioxide, through, water, and, non, reactive, quartz, fragments, about, 20, of, the, produced, oxides, of, nitrogen, remained, unreacted, so, the, final, towers, contained, an, alkali, solution, to, neutralize, the, rest, the, process, was, very, energy, intensive, and, was, rapidly, displaced, by, the, ostwald, process, once, cheap, ammonia, became, available, another, early, production, method, was, invented, by, french, engineer, albert, nodon, around, 1913, his, method, produced, nitric, acid, from, electrolysis, of, calcium, nitrate, converted, by, bacteria, from, nitrogenous, matter, in, peat, bogs, an, earthenware, pot, surrounded, by, limestone, was, sunk, into, the, peat, and, staked, with, tarred, lumber, to, make, a, compartment, for, the, carbon, anode, around, which, the, nitric, acid, is, formed, nitric, acid, was, pumped, out, from, an, earthenware, pipe, that, was, sunk, down, to, the, bottom, of, the, pot, fresh, water, was, pumped, into, the, top, through, another, earthenware, pipe, to, replace, the, fluid, removed, the, interior, was, filled, with, coke, cast, iron, cathodes, were, sunk, into, the, peat, surrounding, it, resistance, was, about, 3, ohms, per, cubic, meter, and, the, power, supplied, was, around, 10, volts, production, from, one, deposit, was, 800, tons, per, year, once, the, haber, process, for, the, efficient, production, of, ammonia, was, introduced, in, 1913, nitric, acid, production, from, ammonia, using, the, ostwald, process, overtook, production, from, the, birkeland, eyde, process, this, method, of, production, is, still, in, use, today, commercially, available, nitric, acid, is, an, azeotrope, with, water, at, a, concentration, of, 68, hno, 3, this, solution, has, a, boiling, temperature, of, 120, 5, c, 249, f, at, 1, atm, it, is, known, as, concentrated, nitric, acid, the, azeotrope, of, nitric, acid, and, water, is, a, colourless, liquid, at, room, temperature, two, solid, hydrates, are, known, the, monohydrate, hno, 3, h, 2, o, or, oxonium, nitrate, and, the, trihydrate, hno, 3, 3h, 2, o, an, older, density, scale, is, occasionally, seen, with, concentrated, nitric, acid, specified, as, 42, baum, nitric, acid, is, subject, to, thermal, or, light, decomposition, and, for, this, reason, it, was, often, stored, in, brown, glass, bottles, this, reaction, may, give, rise, to, some, non, negligible, variations, in, the, vapor, pressure, above, the, liquid, because, the, nitrogen, oxides, produced, dissolve, partly, or, completely, in, the, acid, the, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, and, or, dinitrogen, tetroxide, n, 2, o, 4, remains, dissolved, in, the, nitric, acid, coloring, it, yellow, or, even, red, at, higher, temperatures, while, the, pure, acid, tends, to, give, off, white, fumes, when, exposed, to, air, acid, with, dissolved, nitrogen, dioxide, gives, off, reddish, brown, vapors, leading, to, the, common, names, red, fuming, nitric, acid, and, white, fuming, nitric, acid, nitrogen, oxides, no, x, are, soluble, in, nitric, acid, commercial, grade, fuming, nitric, acid, contains, 98, hno, 3, and, has, a, density, of, 1, 50, g, cm, 3, this, grade, is, often, used, in, the, explosives, industry, it, is, not, as, volatile, nor, as, corrosive, as, the, anhydrous, acid, and, has, the, approximate, concentration, of, 21, 4, m, red, fuming, nitric, acid, or, rfna, contains, substantial, quantities, of, dissolved, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, leaving, the, solution, with, a, reddish, brown, color, due, to, the, dissolved, nitrogen, dioxide, the, density, of, red, fuming, nitric, acid, is, lower, at, 1, 490, g, cm, 3, an, inhibited, fuming, nitric, acid, either, white, inhibited, fuming, nitric, acid, iwfna, or, red, inhibited, fuming, nitric, acid, irfna, can, be, made, by, the, addition, of, 0, 6, to, 0, 7, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, this, fluoride, is, added, for, corrosion, resistance, in, metal, tanks, the, fluoride, creates, a, metal, fluoride, layer, that, protects, the, metal, white, fuming, nitric, acid, pure, nitric, acid, or, wfna, is, very, close, to, anhydrous, nitric, acid, it, is, available, as, 99, 9, nitric, acid, by, assay, or, about, 24, molar, one, specification, for, white, fuming, nitric, acid, is, that, it, has, a, maximum, of, 2, water, and, a, maximum, of, 0, 5, dissolved, no, 2, anhydrous, nitric, acid, is, a, colorless, low, viscosity, mobile, liquid, with, a, density, of, 1, 512, 3, g, cm, 3, that, solidifies, at, 42, c, 44, f, to, form, white, crystals, its, dynamic, viscosity, under, standard, conditions, is, 0, 76, cp, as, it, decomposes, to, no, 2, and, water, it, obtains, a, yellow, tint, it, boils, at, 83, c, 181, f, it, is, usually, stored, in, a, glass, shatterproof, amber, bottle, with, twice, the, volume, of, head, space, to, allow, for, pressure, build, up, but, even, with, those, precautions, the, bottle, must, be, vented, monthly, to, release, pressure, the, two, terminal, n, o, bonds, are, nearly, equivalent, and, relatively, short, at, 1, 20, and, 1, 21, this, can, be, explained, by, theories, of, resonance, the, two, major, canonical, forms, show, some, double, bond, character, in, these, two, bonds, causing, them, to, be, shorter, than, n, o, single, bonds, the, third, n, o, bond, is, elongated, because, its, o, atom, is, bonded, to, h, atom, with, a, bond, length, of, 1, 41, in, the, gas, phase, the, molecule, is, slightly, aplanar, the, no, 2, and, noh, planes, are, tilted, away, from, each, other, by, 2, and, there, is, restricted, rotation, about, the, n, oh, single, bond, nitric, acid, is, normally, considered, to, be, a, strong, acid, at, ambient, temperatures, there, is, some, disagreement, over, the, value, of, the, acid, dissociation, constant, though, the, p, k, a, value, is, usually, reported, as, less, than, 1, this, means, that, the, nitric, acid, in, diluted, solution, is, fully, dissociated, except, in, extremely, acidic, solutions, the, p, k, a, value, rises, to, 1, at, a, temperature, of, 250, c, nitric, acid, can, act, as, a, base, with, respect, to, an, acid, such, as, sulfuric, acid, the, nitronium, ion, is, the, active, reagent, in, aromatic, nitration, reactions, since, nitric, acid, has, both, acidic, and, basic, properties, it, can, undergo, an, autoprotolysis, reaction, similar, to, the, self, ionization, of, water, nitric, acid, reacts, with, most, metals, but, the, details, depend, on, the, concentration, of, the, acid, and, the, nature, of, the, metal, dilute, nitric, acid, behaves, as, a, typical, acid, in, its, reaction, with, most, metals, magnesium, manganese, and, zinc, liberate, h, 2, nitric, acid, can, oxidize, non, active, metals, such, as, copper, and, silver, with, these, non, active, or, less, electropositive, metals, the, products, depend, on, temperature, and, the, acid, concentration, for, example, copper, reacts, with, dilute, nitric, acid, at, ambient, temperatures, with, a, 3, 8, stoichiometry, the, nitric, oxide, produced, may, react, with, atmospheric, oxygen, to, give, nitrogen, dioxide, with, more, concentrated, nitric, acid, nitrogen, dioxide, is, produced, directly, in, a, reaction, with, 1, 4, stoichiometry, upon, reaction, with, nitric, acid, most, metals, give, the, corresponding, nitrates, some, metalloids, and, metals, give, the, oxides, for, instance, sn, as, sb, and, ti, are, oxidized, into, sno, 2, as, 2, o, 5, sb, 2, o, 5, and, tio, 2, respectively, some, precious, metals, such, as, pure, gold, and, platinum, group, metals, do, not, react, with, nitric, acid, though, pure, gold, does, react, with, aqua, regia, a, mixture, of, concentrated, nitric, acid, and, hydrochloric, acid, however, some, less, noble, metals, ag, cu, present, in, some, gold, alloys, relatively, poor, in, gold, such, as, colored, gold, can, be, easily, oxidized, and, dissolved, by, nitric, acid, leading, to, colour, changes, of, the, gold, alloy, surface, nitric, acid, is, used, as, a, cheap, means, in, jewelry, shops, to, quickly, spot, low, gold, alloys, 14, karats, and, to, rapidly, assess, the, gold, purity, being, a, powerful, oxidizing, agent, nitric, acid, reacts, with, many, non, metallic, compounds, sometimes, explosively, depending, on, the, acid, concentration, temperature, and, the, reducing, agent, involved, the, end, products, can, be, variable, reaction, takes, place, with, all, metals, except, the, noble, metals, series, and, certain, alloys, as, a, general, rule, oxidizing, reactions, occur, primarily, with, the, concentrated, acid, favoring, the, formation, of, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, however, the, powerful, oxidizing, properties, of, nitric, acid, are, thermodynamic, in, nature, but, sometimes, its, oxidation, reactions, are, rather, kinetically, non, favored, the, presence, of, small, amounts, of, nitrous, acid, hno, 2, greatly, increases, the, rate, of, reaction, although, chromium, cr, iron, fe, and, aluminium, al, readily, dissolve, in, dilute, nitric, acid, the, concentrated, acid, forms, a, metal, oxide, layer, that, protects, the, bulk, of, the, metal, from, further, oxidation, the, formation, of, this, protective, layer, is, called, passivation, typical, passivation, concentrations, range, from, 20, to, 50, by, volume, metals, that, are, passivated, by, concentrated, nitric, acid, are, iron, cobalt, chromium, nickel, and, aluminium, being, a, powerful, oxidizing, acid, nitric, acid, reacts, with, many, organic, materials, and, the, reactions, may, be, explosive, the, hydroxyl, group, will, typically, strip, a, hydrogen, from, the, organic, molecule, to, form, water, and, the, remaining, nitro, group, takes, the, hydrogen, s, place, nitration, of, organic, compounds, with, nitric, acid, is, the, primary, method, of, synthesis, of, many, common, explosives, such, as, nitroglycerin, and, trinitrotoluene, tnt, as, very, many, less, stable, byproducts, are, possible, these, reactions, must, be, carefully, thermally, controlled, and, the, byproducts, removed, to, isolate, the, desired, product, reaction, with, non, metallic, elements, with, the, exceptions, of, nitrogen, oxygen, noble, gases, silicon, and, halogens, other, than, iodine, usually, oxidizes, them, to, their, highest, oxidation, states, as, acids, with, the, formation, of, nitrogen, dioxide, for, concentrated, acid, and, nitric, oxide, for, dilute, acid, concentrated, nitric, acid, oxidizes, i, 2, p, 4, and, s, 8, into, hio, 3, h, 3, po, 4, and, h, 2, so, 4, respectively, although, it, reacts, with, graphite, and, amorphous, carbon, it, does, not, react, with, diamond, it, can, separate, diamond, from, the, graphite, that, it, oxidizes, nitric, acid, reacts, with, proteins, to, form, yellow, nitrated, products, this, reaction, is, known, as, the, xanthoproteic, reaction, this, test, is, carried, out, by, adding, concentrated, nitric, acid, to, the, substance, being, tested, and, then, heating, the, mixture, if, proteins, that, contain, amino, acids, with, aromatic, rings, are, present, the, mixture, turns, yellow, upon, adding, a, base, such, as, ammonia, the, color, turns, orange, these, color, changes, are, caused, by, nitrated, aromatic, rings, in, the, protein, xanthoproteic, acid, is, formed, when, the, acid, contacts, epithelial, cells, respective, local, skin, color, changes, are, indicative, of, inadequate, safety, precautions, when, handling, nitric, acid, industrial, nitric, acid, production, uses, the, ostwald, process, the, combined, ostwald, and, haber, processes, are, extremely, efficient, requiring, only, air, and, natural, gas, feedstocks, the, ostwald, process, technical, innovation, is, the, proper, conditions, under, which, anhydrous, ammonia, burns, to, nitric, oxide, no, instead, of, dinitrogen, n, 2, the, nitric, oxide, is, then, oxidized, often, with, atmospheric, oxygen, to, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, the, dioxide, then, disproportionates, in, water, to, nitric, acid, and, the, nitric, oxide, feedstock, the, net, reaction, is, maximal, oxidation, of, ammonia, dissolved, nitrogen, oxides, are, either, stripped, in, the, case, of, white, fuming, nitric, acid, or, remain, in, solution, to, form, red, fuming, nitric, acid, commercial, grade, nitric, acid, solutions, are, usually, between, 52, and, 68, nitric, acid, by, mass, the, maximum, distillable, concentration, further, dehydration, to, 98, can, be, achieved, with, concentrated, h, 2, so, 4, historically, higher, acid, concentrations, were, also, produced, by, dissolving, additional, nitrogen, dioxide, in, the, acid, but, the, last, plant, in, the, united, states, ceased, using, that, process, in, 2012, more, recently, electrochemical, means, have, been, developed, to, produce, anhydrous, acid, from, concentrated, nitric, acid, feedstock, laboratory, scale, nitric, acid, syntheses, abound, most, take, inspiration, from, the, industrial, techniques, a, wide, variety, of, nitrate, salts, metathesize, with, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, for, example, sodium, nitrate, distillation, at, nitric, acid, s, 83, c, boiling, point, then, separates, the, solid, metal, salt, residue, the, resulting, acid, solution, is, the, 68, 5, azeotrope, and, can, be, further, concentrated, as, in, industry, with, either, sulfuric, acid, or, magnesium, nitrate, alternatively, thermal, decomposition, of, copper, ii, nitrate, gives, nitrogen, dioxide, and, oxygen, gases, these, are, then, passed, through, water, or, hydrogen, peroxide, as, in, the, ostwald, process, the, main, industrial, use, of, nitric, acid, is, for, the, production, of, fertilizers, nitric, acid, is, neutralized, with, ammonia, to, give, ammonium, nitrate, this, application, consumes, 75, 80, of, the, 26, million, tonnes, produced, annually, 1987, the, other, main, applications, are, for, the, production, of, explosives, nylon, precursors, and, specialty, organic, compounds, in, organic, synthesis, industrial, and, otherwise, the, nitro, group, is, a, versatile, functional, group, a, mixture, of, nitric, and, sulfuric, acids, introduces, a, nitro, substituent, onto, various, aromatic, compounds, by, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, many, explosives, such, as, tnt, are, prepared, this, way, either, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, or, oleum, absorbs, the, excess, water, the, nitro, group, can, be, reduced, to, give, an, amine, group, allowing, synthesis, of, aniline, compounds, from, various, nitrobenzenes, the, precursor, to, nylon, adipic, acid, is, produced, on, a, large, scale, by, oxidation, of, ka, oil, a, mixture, of, cyclohexanone, and, cyclohexanol, with, nitric, acid, nitric, acid, has, been, used, in, various, forms, as, the, oxidizer, in, liquid, fueled, rockets, these, forms, include, red, fuming, nitric, acid, white,
