in, quantum, mechanics, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, states, that, two, or, more, identical, particles, with, half, integer, spins, i, e, fermions, cannot, simultaneously, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, within, a, system, that, obeys, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, this, principle, was, formulated, by, austrian, physicist, wolfgang, pauli, in, 1925, for, electrons, and, later, extended, to, all, fermions, with, his, spin, statistics, theorem, of, 1940, in, the, case, of, electrons, in, atoms, the, exclusion, principle, can, be, stated, as, follows, in, a, poly, electron, atom, it, is, impossible, for, any, two, electrons, to, have, the, same, two, values, of, all, four, of, their, quantum, numbers, which, are, n, the, principal, quantum, number, the, azimuthal, quantum, number, m, the, magnetic, quantum, number, and, m, s, the, spin, quantum, number, for, example, if, two, electrons, reside, in, the, same, orbital, then, their, values, of, n, and, m, are, equal, in, that, case, the, two, values, of, m, s, spin, pair, must, be, different, since, the, only, two, possible, values, for, the, spin, projection, m, s, are, 1, 2, and, 1, 2, it, follows, that, one, electron, must, have, m, s, 1, 2, and, one, m, s, 1, 2, particles, with, an, integer, spin, bosons, are, not, subject, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, any, number, of, identical, bosons, can, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, such, as, photons, produced, by, a, laser, or, atoms, found, in, a, bose, einstein, condensate, a, more, rigorous, statement, is, under, the, exchange, of, two, identical, particles, the, total, many, particle, wave, function, is, antisymmetric, for, fermions, and, symmetric, for, bosons, this, means, that, if, the, space, and, spin, coordinates, of, two, identical, particles, are, interchanged, then, the, total, wave, function, changes, sign, for, fermions, but, does, not, change, sign, for, bosons, so, if, hypothetically, two, fermions, were, in, the, same, state, for, example, in, the, same, atom, in, the, same, orbital, with, the, same, spin, then, interchanging, them, would, change, nothing, and, the, total, wave, function, would, be, unchanged, however, the, only, way, a, total, wave, function, can, both, change, sign, required, for, fermions, and, also, remain, unchanged, is, that, such, a, function, must, be, zero, everywhere, which, means, such, a, state, cannot, exist, this, reasoning, does, not, apply, to, bosons, because, the, sign, does, not, change, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, describes, the, behavior, of, all, fermions, particles, with, half, integer, spin, while, bosons, particles, with, integer, spin, are, subject, to, other, principles, fermions, include, elementary, particles, such, as, quarks, electrons, and, neutrinos, additionally, baryons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, subatomic, particles, composed, from, three, quarks, and, some, atoms, such, as, helium, 3, are, fermions, and, are, therefore, described, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, as, well, atoms, can, have, different, overall, spin, which, determines, whether, they, are, fermions, or, bosons, for, example, helium, 3, has, spin, 1, 2, and, is, therefore, a, fermion, whereas, helium, 4, has, spin, 0, and, is, a, boson, 123, 125, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, underpins, many, properties, of, everyday, matter, from, its, large, scale, stability, to, the, chemical, behavior, of, atoms, half, integer, spin, means, that, the, intrinsic, angular, momentum, value, of, fermions, is, h, 2, displaystyle, hbar, h, 2, pi, reduced, planck, constant, times, a, half, integer, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, etc, in, the, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, fermions, are, described, by, antisymmetric, states, in, contrast, particles, with, integer, spin, bosons, have, symmetric, wave, functions, and, may, share, the, same, quantum, states, bosons, include, the, photon, the, cooper, pairs, which, are, responsible, for, superconductivity, and, the, w, and, z, bosons, fermions, take, their, name, from, the, fermi, dirac, statistical, distribution, which, they, obey, and, bosons, take, theirs, from, the, bose, einstein, distribution, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, became, evident, that, atoms, and, molecules, with, even, numbers, of, electrons, are, more, chemically, stable, than, those, with, odd, numbers, of, electrons, in, the, 1916, article, the, atom, and, the, molecule, by, gilbert, n, lewis, for, example, the, third, of, his, six, postulates, of, chemical, behavior, states, that, the, atom, tends, to, hold, an, even, number, of, electrons, in, any, given, shell, and, especially, to, hold, eight, electrons, which, he, assumed, to, be, typically, arranged, symmetrically, at, the, eight, corners, of, a, cube, in, 1919, chemist, irving, langmuir, suggested, that, the, periodic, table, could, be, explained, if, the, electrons, in, an, atom, were, connected, or, clustered, in, some, manner, groups, of, electrons, were, thought, to, occupy, a, set, of, electron, shells, around, the, nucleus, in, 1922, niels, bohr, updated, his, model, of, the, atom, by, assuming, that, certain, numbers, of, electrons, for, example, 2, 8, and, 18, corresponded, to, stable, closed, shells, 203, pauli, looked, for, an, explanation, for, these, numbers, which, were, at, first, only, empirical, at, the, same, time, he, was, trying, to, explain, experimental, results, of, the, zeeman, effect, in, atomic, spectroscopy, and, in, ferromagnetism, he, found, an, essential, clue, in, a, 1924, paper, by, edmund, c, stoner, which, pointed, out, that, for, a, given, value, of, the, principal, quantum, number, n, the, number, of, energy, levels, of, a, single, electron, in, the, alkali, metal, spectra, in, an, external, magnetic, field, where, all, degenerate, energy, levels, are, separated, is, equal, to, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, closed, shell, of, the, noble, gases, for, the, same, value, of, n, this, led, pauli, to, realize, that, the, complicated, numbers, of, electrons, in, closed, shells, can, be, reduced, to, the, simple, rule, of, one, electron, per, state, if, the, electron, states, are, defined, using, four, quantum, numbers, for, this, purpose, he, introduced, a, new, two, valued, quantum, number, identified, by, samuel, goudsmit, and, george, uhlenbeck, as, electron, spin, in, his, nobel, lecture, pauli, clarified, the, importance, of, quantum, state, symmetry, to, the, exclusion, principle, among, the, different, classes, of, symmetry, the, most, important, ones, which, moreover, for, two, particles, are, the, only, ones, are, the, symmetrical, class, in, which, the, wave, function, does, not, change, its, value, when, the, space, and, spin, coordinates, of, two, particles, are, permuted, and, the, antisymmetrical, class, in, which, for, such, a, permutation, the, wave, function, changes, its, sign, the, correct, and, general, wave, mechanical, formulation, of, the, exclusion, principle, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, with, a, single, valued, many, particle, wavefunction, is, equivalent, to, requiring, the, wavefunction, to, be, antisymmetric, with, respect, to, exchange, if, x, displaystyle, x, rangle, and, y, displaystyle, y, rangle, range, over, the, basis, vectors, of, the, hilbert, space, describing, a, one, particle, system, then, the, tensor, product, produces, the, basis, vectors, x, y, x, y, displaystyle, x, y, rangle, x, rangle, otimes, y, rangle, of, the, hilbert, space, describing, a, system, of, two, such, particles, any, two, particle, state, can, be, represented, as, a, superposition, i, e, sum, of, these, basis, vectors, where, each, a, x, y, is, a, complex, scalar, coefficient, antisymmetry, under, exchange, means, that, a, x, y, a, y, x, this, implies, a, x, y, 0, when, x, y, which, is, pauli, exclusion, it, is, true, in, any, basis, since, local, changes, of, basis, keep, antisymmetric, matrices, antisymmetric, conversely, if, the, diagonal, quantities, a, x, x, are, zero, in, every, basis, then, the, wavefunction, component, is, necessarily, antisymmetric, to, prove, it, consider, the, matrix, element, this, is, zero, because, the, two, particles, have, zero, probability, to, both, be, in, the, superposition, state, x, y, displaystyle, x, rangle, y, rangle, but, this, is, equal, to, the, first, and, last, terms, are, diagonal, elements, and, are, zero, and, the, whole, sum, is, equal, to, zero, so, the, wavefunction, matrix, elements, obey, or, for, a, system, with, n, 2, particles, the, multi, particle, basis, states, become, n, fold, tensor, products, of, one, particle, basis, states, and, the, coefficients, of, the, wavefunction, a, x, 1, x, 2, x, n, displaystyle, a, x, 1, x, 2, ldots, x, n, are, identified, by, n, one, particle, states, the, condition, of, antisymmetry, states, that, the, coefficients, must, flip, sign, whenever, any, two, states, are, exchanged, a, x, i, x, j, a, x, j, x, i, displaystyle, a, ldots, x, i, ldots, x, j, ldots, a, ldots, x, j, ldots, x, i, ldots, for, any, i, j, displaystyle, i, neq, j, the, exclusion, principle, is, the, consequence, that, if, x, i, x, j, displaystyle, x, i, x, j, for, any, i, j, displaystyle, i, neq, j, then, a, x, i, x, j, 0, displaystyle, a, ldots, x, i, ldots, x, j, ldots, 0, this, shows, that, none, of, the, n, particles, may, be, in, the, same, state, according, to, the, spin, statistics, theorem, particles, with, integer, spin, occupy, symmetric, quantum, states, and, particles, with, half, integer, spin, occupy, antisymmetric, states, furthermore, only, integer, or, half, integer, values, of, spin, are, allowed, by, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, in, relativistic, quantum, field, theory, the, pauli, principle, follows, from, applying, a, rotation, operator, in, imaginary, time, to, particles, of, half, integer, spin, in, one, dimension, bosons, as, well, as, fermions, can, obey, the, exclusion, principle, a, one, dimensional, bose, gas, with, delta, function, repulsive, interactions, of, infinite, strength, is, equivalent, to, a, gas, of, free, fermions, the, reason, for, this, is, that, in, one, dimension, the, exchange, of, particles, requires, that, they, pass, through, each, other, for, infinitely, strong, repulsion, this, cannot, happen, this, model, is, described, by, a, quantum, nonlinear, schr, dinger, equation, in, momentum, space, the, exclusion, principle, is, valid, also, for, finite, repulsion, in, a, bose, gas, with, delta, function, interactions, as, well, as, for, interacting, spins, and, hubbard, model, in, one, dimension, and, for, other, models, solvable, by, bethe, ansatz, the, ground, state, in, models, solvable, by, bethe, ansatz, is, a, fermi, sphere, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, helps, explain, a, wide, variety, of, physical, phenomena, one, particularly, important, consequence, of, the, principle, is, the, elaborate, electron, shell, structure, of, atoms, and, the, way, atoms, share, electrons, explaining, the, variety, of, chemical, elements, and, their, chemical, combinations, an, electrically, neutral, atom, contains, bound, electrons, equal, in, number, to, the, protons, in, the, nucleus, electrons, being, fermions, cannot, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, as, other, electrons, so, electrons, have, to, stack, within, an, atom, i, e, have, different, spins, while, at, the, same, electron, orbital, as, described, below, an, example, is, the, neutral, helium, atom, he, which, has, two, bound, electrons, both, of, which, can, occupy, the, lowest, energy, 1s, states, by, acquiring, opposite, spin, as, spin, is, part, of, the, quantum, state, of, the, electron, the, two, electrons, are, in, different, quantum, states, and, do, not, violate, the, pauli, principle, however, the, spin, can, take, only, two, different, values, eigenvalues, in, a, lithium, atom, li, with, three, bound, electrons, the, third, electron, cannot, reside, in, a, 1s, state, and, must, occupy, a, higher, energy, state, instead, the, lowest, available, state, is, 2s, so, that, the, ground, state, of, li, is, 1s, 2, 2s, similarly, successively, larger, elements, must, have, shells, of, successively, higher, energy, the, chemical, properties, of, an, element, largely, depend, on, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, outermost, shell, atoms, with, different, numbers, of, occupied, electron, shells, but, the, same, number, of, electrons, in, the, outermost, shell, have, similar, properties, which, gives, rise, to, the, periodic, table, of, the, elements, 214, 218, to, test, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, for, the, helium, atom, gordon, drake, carried, out, very, precise, calculations, for, hypothetical, states, of, the, he, atom, that, violate, it, which, are, called, paronic, states, later, k, deilamian, et, al, used, an, atomic, beam, spectrometer, to, search, for, the, paronic, state, 1s2s, 1, s, 0, calculated, by, drake, the, search, was, unsuccessful, and, showed, that, the, statistical, weight, of, this, paronic, state, has, an, upper, limit, of, 5, 10, 6, the, exclusion, principle, implies, a, weight, of, zero, in, conductors, and, semiconductors, there, are, very, large, numbers, of, molecular, orbitals, which, effectively, form, a, continuous, band, structure, of, energy, levels, in, strong, conductors, metals, electrons, are, so, degenerate, that, they, cannot, even, contribute, much, to, the, thermal, capacity, of, a, metal, 133, 147, many, mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, and, chemical, properties, of, solids, are, the, direct, consequence, of, pauli, exclusion, the, stability, of, each, electron, state, in, an, atom, is, described, by, the, quantum, theory, of, the, atom, which, shows, that, close, approach, of, an, electron, to, the, nucleus, necessarily, increases, the, electron, s, kinetic, energy, an, application, of, the, uncertainty, principle, of, heisenberg, however, stability, of, large, systems, with, many, electrons, and, many, nucleons, is, a, different, question, and, requires, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, it, has, been, shown, that, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, is, responsible, for, the, fact, that, ordinary, bulk, matter, is, stable, and, occupies, volume, this, suggestion, was, first, made, in, 1931, by, paul, ehrenfest, who, pointed, out, that, the, electrons, of, each, atom, cannot, all, fall, into, the, lowest, energy, orbital, and, must, occupy, successively, larger, shells, atoms, therefore, occupy, a, volume, and, cannot, be, squeezed, too, closely, together, the, first, rigorous, proof, was, provided, in, 1967, by, freeman, dyson, and, andrew, lenard, de, who, considered, the, balance, of, attractive, electron, nuclear, and, repulsive, electron, electron, and, nuclear, nuclear, forces, and, showed, that, ordinary, matter, would, collapse, and, occupy, a, much, smaller, volume, without, the, pauli, principle, a, much, simpler, proof, was, found, later, by, elliott, h, lieb, and, walter, thirring, in, 1975, they, provided, a, lower, bound, on, the, quantum, energy, in, terms, of, the, thomas, fermi, model, which, is, stable, due, to, a, theorem, of, teller, the, proof, used, a, lower, bound, on, the, kinetic, energy, which, is, now, called, the, lieb, thirring, inequality, the, consequence, of, the, pauli, principle, here, is, that, electrons, of, the, same, spin, are, kept, apart, by, a, repulsive, exchange, interaction, which, is, a, short, range, effect, acting, simultaneously, with, the, long, range, electrostatic, or, coulombic, force, this, effect, is, partly, responsible, for, the, everyday, observation, in, the, macroscopic, world, that, two, solid, objects, cannot, be, in, the, same, place, at, the, same, time, dyson, and, lenard, did, not, consider, the, extreme, magnetic, or, gravitational, forces, that, occur, in, some, astronomical, objects, in, 1995, elliott, lieb, and, coworkers, showed, that, the, pauli, principle, still, leads, to, stability, in, intense, magnetic, fields, such, as, in, neutron, stars, although, at, a, much, higher, density, than, in, ordinary, matter, it, is, a, consequence, of, general, relativity, that, in, sufficiently, intense, gravitational, fields, matter, collapses, to, form, a, black, hole, astronomy, provides, a, spectacular, demonstration, of, the, effect, of, the, pauli, principle, in, the, form, of, white, dwarf, and, neutron, stars, in, both, bodies, the, atomic, structure, is, disrupted, by, extreme, pressure, but, the, stars, are, held, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, by, degeneracy, pressure, also, known, as, fermi, pressure, this, exotic, form, of, matter, is, known, as, degenerate, matter, the, immense, gravitational, force, of, a, star, s, mass, is, normally, held, in, equilibrium, by, thermal, pressure, caused, by, heat, produced, in, thermonuclear, fusion, in, the, star, s, core, in, white, dwarfs, which, do, not, undergo, nuclear, fusion, an, opposing, force, to, gravity, is, provided, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, in, neutron, stars, subject, to, even, stronger, gravitational, forces, electrons, have, merged, with, protons, to, form, neutrons, neutrons, are, capable, of, producing, an, even, higher, degeneracy, pressure, neutron, degeneracy, pressure, albeit, over, a, shorter, range, this, can, stabilize, neutron, stars, from, further, collapse, but, at, a, smaller, size, and, higher, density, than, a, white, dwarf, neutron, stars, are, the, most, rigid, objects, known, their, young, modulus, or, more, accurately, bulk, modulus, is, 20, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, that, of, diamond, however, even, this, enormous, rigidity, can, be, overcome, by, the, gravitational, field, of, a, neutron, star, mass, exceeding, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, leading, to, the, formation, of, a, black, hole, 286, 287
