in, physics, spacetime, also, called, the, space, time, continuum, is, a, mathematical, model, that, fuses, the, three, dimensions, of, space, and, the, one, dimension, of, time, into, a, single, four, dimensional, continuum, spacetime, diagrams, are, useful, in, visualizing, and, understanding, relativistic, effects, such, as, how, different, observers, perceive, where, and, when, events, occur, until, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, assumption, had, been, that, the, three, dimensional, geometry, of, the, universe, its, description, in, terms, of, locations, shapes, distances, and, directions, was, distinct, from, time, the, measurement, of, when, events, occur, within, the, universe, however, space, and, time, took, on, new, meanings, with, the, lorentz, transformation, and, special, theory, of, relativity, in, 1908, hermann, minkowski, presented, a, geometric, interpretation, of, special, relativity, that, fused, time, and, the, three, spatial, dimensions, of, space, into, a, single, four, dimensional, continuum, now, known, as, minkowski, space, this, interpretation, proved, vital, to, the, general, theory, of, relativity, wherein, spacetime, is, curved, by, mass, and, energy, non, relativistic, classical, mechanics, treats, time, as, a, universal, quantity, of, measurement, that, is, uniform, throughout, is, separate, from, space, and, is, agreed, on, by, all, observers, classical, mechanics, assumes, that, time, has, a, constant, rate, of, passage, independent, of, the, observer, s, state, of, motion, or, anything, external, it, assumes, that, space, is, euclidean, it, assumes, that, space, follows, the, geometry, of, common, sense, in, the, context, of, special, relativity, time, cannot, be, separated, from, the, three, dimensions, of, space, because, the, observed, rate, at, which, time, passes, for, an, object, depends, on, the, object, s, velocity, relative, to, the, observer, 214, 217, general, relativity, provides, an, explanation, of, how, gravitational, fields, can, slow, the, passage, of, time, for, an, object, as, seen, by, an, observer, outside, the, field, in, ordinary, space, a, position, is, specified, by, three, numbers, known, as, dimensions, in, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, these, are, often, called, x, y, and, z, a, point, in, spacetime, is, called, an, event, and, requires, four, numbers, to, be, specified, the, three, dimensional, location, in, space, plus, the, position, in, time, fig, 1, an, event, is, represented, by, a, set, of, coordinates, x, y, z, and, t, spacetime, is, thus, four, dimensional, unlike, the, analogies, used, in, popular, writings, to, explain, events, such, as, firecrackers, or, sparks, mathematical, events, have, zero, duration, and, represent, a, single, point, in, spacetime, although, it, is, possible, to, be, in, motion, relative, to, the, popping, of, a, firecracker, or, a, spark, it, is, not, possible, for, an, observer, to, be, in, motion, relative, to, an, event, the, path, of, a, particle, through, spacetime, can, be, considered, to, be, a, sequence, of, events, the, series, of, events, can, be, linked, together, to, form, a, curve, that, represents, the, particle, s, progress, through, spacetime, that, path, is, called, the, particle, s, world, line, 105, mathematically, spacetime, is, a, manifold, which, is, to, say, it, appears, locally, flat, near, each, point, in, the, same, way, that, at, small, enough, scales, the, surface, of, a, globe, appears, to, be, flat, a, scale, factor, c, displaystyle, c, conventionally, called, the, speed, of, light, relates, distances, measured, in, space, to, distances, measured, in, time, the, magnitude, of, this, scale, factor, nearly, 300, 000, kilometres, or, 190, 000, miles, in, space, being, equivalent, to, one, second, in, time, along, with, the, fact, that, spacetime, is, a, manifold, implies, that, at, ordinary, non, relativistic, speeds, and, at, ordinary, human, scale, distances, there, is, little, that, humans, might, observe, that, is, noticeably, different, from, what, they, might, observe, if, the, world, were, euclidean, it, was, only, with, the, advent, of, sensitive, scientific, measurements, in, the, mid, 1800s, such, as, the, fizeau, experiment, and, the, michelson, morley, experiment, that, puzzling, discrepancies, began, to, be, noted, between, observation, versus, predictions, based, on, the, implicit, assumption, of, euclidean, space, in, special, relativity, an, observer, will, in, most, cases, mean, a, frame, of, reference, from, which, a, set, of, objects, or, events, is, being, measured, this, usage, differs, significantly, from, the, ordinary, english, meaning, of, the, term, reference, frames, are, inherently, nonlocal, constructs, and, according, to, this, usage, of, the, term, it, does, not, make, sense, to, speak, of, an, observer, as, having, a, location, in, fig, 1, 1, imagine, that, the, frame, under, consideration, is, equipped, with, a, dense, lattice, of, clocks, synchronized, within, this, reference, frame, that, extends, indefinitely, throughout, the, three, dimensions, of, space, any, specific, location, within, the, lattice, is, not, important, the, latticework, of, clocks, is, used, to, determine, the, time, and, position, of, events, taking, place, within, the, whole, frame, the, term, observer, refers, to, the, whole, ensemble, of, clocks, associated, with, one, inertial, frame, of, reference, 17, 22, in, this, idealized, case, every, point, in, space, has, a, clock, associated, with, it, and, thus, the, clocks, register, each, event, instantly, with, no, time, delay, between, an, event, and, its, recording, a, real, observer, will, see, a, delay, between, the, emission, of, a, signal, and, its, detection, due, to, the, speed, of, light, to, synchronize, the, clocks, in, the, data, reduction, following, an, experiment, the, time, when, a, signal, is, received, will, be, corrected, to, reflect, its, actual, time, were, it, to, have, been, recorded, by, an, idealized, lattice, of, clocks, 17, 22, in, many, books, on, special, relativity, especially, older, ones, the, word, observer, is, used, in, the, more, ordinary, sense, of, the, word, it, is, usually, clear, from, context, which, meaning, has, been, adopted, physicists, distinguish, between, what, one, measures, or, observes, after, one, has, factored, out, signal, propagation, delays, versus, what, one, visually, sees, without, such, corrections, failing, to, understand, the, difference, between, what, one, measures, and, what, one, sees, is, the, source, of, much, confusion, among, students, of, relativity, by, the, mid, 1800s, various, experiments, such, as, the, observation, of, the, arago, spot, and, differential, measurements, of, the, speed, of, light, in, air, versus, water, were, considered, to, have, proven, the, wave, nature, of, light, as, opposed, to, a, corpuscular, theory, propagation, of, waves, was, then, assumed, to, require, the, existence, of, a, waving, medium, in, the, case, of, light, waves, this, was, considered, to, be, a, hypothetical, luminiferous, aether, the, various, attempts, to, establish, the, properties, of, this, hypothetical, medium, yielded, contradictory, results, for, example, the, fizeau, experiment, of, 1851, conducted, by, french, physicist, hippolyte, fizeau, demonstrated, that, the, speed, of, light, in, flowing, water, was, less, than, the, sum, of, the, speed, of, light, in, air, plus, the, speed, of, the, water, by, an, amount, dependent, on, the, water, s, index, of, refraction, among, other, issues, the, dependence, of, the, partial, aether, dragging, implied, by, this, experiment, on, the, index, of, refraction, which, is, dependent, on, wavelength, led, to, the, unpalatable, conclusion, that, aether, simultaneously, flows, at, different, speeds, for, different, colors, of, light, the, michelson, morley, experiment, of, 1887, fig, 1, 2, showed, no, differential, influence, of, earth, s, motions, through, the, hypothetical, aether, on, the, speed, of, light, and, the, most, likely, explanation, complete, aether, dragging, was, in, conflict, with, the, observation, of, stellar, aberration, george, francis, fitzgerald, in, 1889, and, hendrik, lorentz, in, 1892, independently, proposed, that, material, bodies, traveling, through, the, fixed, aether, were, physically, affected, by, their, passage, contracting, in, the, direction, of, motion, by, an, amount, that, was, exactly, what, was, necessary, to, explain, the, negative, results, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, no, length, changes, occur, in, directions, transverse, to, the, direction, of, motion, by, 1904, lorentz, had, expanded, his, theory, such, that, he, had, arrived, at, equations, formally, identical, with, those, that, einstein, was, to, derive, later, i, e, the, lorentz, transformation, as, a, theory, of, dynamics, the, study, of, forces, and, torques, and, their, effect, on, motion, his, theory, assumed, actual, physical, deformations, of, the, physical, constituents, of, matter, 163, 174, lorentz, s, equations, predicted, a, quantity, that, he, called, local, time, with, which, he, could, explain, the, aberration, of, light, the, fizeau, experiment, and, other, phenomena, henri, poincar, was, the, first, to, combine, space, and, time, into, spacetime, 73, 80, 93, 95, he, argued, in, 1898, that, the, simultaneity, of, two, events, is, a, matter, of, convention, in, 1900, he, recognized, that, lorentz, s, local, time, is, actually, what, is, indicated, by, moving, clocks, by, applying, an, explicitly, operational, definition, of, clock, synchronization, assuming, constant, light, speed, in, 1900, and, 1904, he, suggested, the, inherent, undetectability, of, the, aether, by, emphasizing, the, validity, of, what, he, called, the, principle, of, relativity, in, 1905, 1906, he, mathematically, perfected, lorentz, s, theory, of, electrons, in, order, to, bring, it, into, accordance, with, the, postulate, of, relativity, while, discussing, various, hypotheses, on, lorentz, invariant, gravitation, he, introduced, the, innovative, concept, of, a, 4, dimensional, spacetime, by, defining, various, four, vectors, namely, four, position, four, velocity, and, four, force, he, did, not, pursue, the, 4, dimensional, formalism, in, subsequent, papers, however, stating, that, this, line, of, research, seemed, to, entail, great, pain, for, limited, profit, ultimately, concluding, that, three, dimensional, language, seems, the, best, suited, to, the, description, of, our, world, even, as, late, as, 1909, poincar, continued, to, describe, the, dynamical, interpretation, of, the, lorentz, transform, 163, 174, in, 1905, albert, einstein, analyzed, special, relativity, in, terms, of, kinematics, the, study, of, moving, bodies, without, reference, to, forces, rather, than, dynamics, his, results, were, mathematically, equivalent, to, those, of, lorentz, and, poincar, he, obtained, them, by, recognizing, that, the, entire, theory, can, be, built, upon, two, postulates, the, principle, of, relativity, and, the, principle, of, the, constancy, of, light, speed, his, work, was, filled, with, vivid, imagery, involving, the, exchange, of, light, signals, between, clocks, in, motion, careful, measurements, of, the, lengths, of, moving, rods, and, other, such, examples, einstein, in, 1905, superseded, previous, attempts, of, an, electromagnetic, mass, energy, relation, by, introducing, the, general, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, which, was, instrumental, for, his, subsequent, formulation, of, the, equivalence, principle, in, 1907, which, declares, the, equivalence, of, inertial, and, gravitational, mass, by, using, the, mass, energy, equivalence, einstein, showed, that, the, gravitational, mass, of, a, body, is, proportional, to, its, energy, content, which, was, one, of, the, early, results, in, developing, general, relativity, while, it, would, appear, that, he, did, not, at, first, think, geometrically, about, spacetime, 219, in, the, further, development, of, general, relativity, einstein, fully, incorporated, the, spacetime, formalism, when, einstein, published, in, 1905, another, of, his, competitors, his, former, mathematics, professor, hermann, minkowski, had, also, arrived, at, most, of, the, basic, elements, of, special, relativity, max, born, recounted, a, meeting, he, had, made, with, minkowski, seeking, to, be, minkowski, s, student, collaborator, i, went, to, cologne, met, minkowski, and, heard, his, celebrated, lecture, space, and, time, delivered, on, 2, september, 1908, he, told, me, later, that, it, came, to, him, as, a, great, shock, when, einstein, published, his, paper, in, which, the, equivalence, of, the, different, local, times, of, observers, moving, relative, to, each, other, was, pronounced, for, he, had, reached, the, same, conclusions, independently, but, did, not, publish, them, because, he, wished, first, to, work, out, the, mathematical, structure, in, all, its, splendor, he, never, made, a, priority, claim, and, always, gave, einstein, his, full, share, in, the, great, discovery, minkowski, had, been, concerned, with, the, state, of, electrodynamics, after, michelson, s, disruptive, experiments, at, least, since, the, summer, of, 1905, when, minkowski, and, david, hilbert, led, an, advanced, seminar, attended, by, notable, physicists, of, the, time, to, study, the, papers, of, lorentz, poincar, et, al, minkowski, saw, einstein, s, work, as, an, extension, of, lorentz, s, and, was, most, directly, influenced, by, poincar, on, 5, november, 1907, a, little, more, than, a, year, before, his, death, minkowski, introduced, his, geometric, interpretation, of, spacetime, in, a, lecture, to, the, g, ttingen, mathematical, society, with, the, title, the, relativity, principle, das, relativit, tsprinzip, on, 21, september, 1908, minkowski, presented, his, talk, space, and, time, raum, und, zeit, to, the, german, society, of, scientists, and, physicians, the, opening, words, of, space, and, time, include, minkowski, s, statement, that, henceforth, space, for, itself, and, time, for, itself, shall, completely, reduce, to, a, mere, shadow, and, only, some, sort, of, union, of, the, two, shall, preserve, independence, space, and, time, included, the, first, public, presentation, of, spacetime, diagrams, fig, 1, 4, and, included, a, remarkable, demonstration, that, the, concept, of, the, invariant, interval, discussed, below, along, with, the, empirical, observation, that, the, speed, of, light, is, finite, allows, derivation, of, the, entirety, of, special, relativity, the, spacetime, concept, and, the, lorentz, group, are, closely, connected, to, certain, types, of, sphere, hyperbolic, or, conformal, geometries, and, their, transformation, groups, already, developed, in, the, 19th, century, in, which, invariant, intervals, analogous, to, the, spacetime, interval, are, used, einstein, for, his, part, was, initially, dismissive, of, minkowski, s, geometric, interpretation, of, special, relativity, regarding, it, as, berfl, ssige, gelehrsamkeit, superfluous, learnedness, however, in, order, to, complete, his, search, for, general, relativity, that, started, in, 1907, the, geometric, interpretation, of, relativity, proved, to, be, vital, in, 1916, einstein, fully, acknowledged, his, indebtedness, to, minkowski, whose, interpretation, greatly, facilitated, the, transition, to, general, relativity, 151, 152, since, there, are, other, types, of, spacetime, such, as, the, curved, spacetime, of, general, relativity, the, spacetime, of, special, relativity, is, today, known, as, minkowski, spacetime, in, three, dimensions, the, distance, d, displaystyle, delta, d, between, two, points, can, be, defined, using, the, pythagorean, theorem, although, two, viewers, may, measure, the, x, y, and, z, position, of, the, two, points, using, different, coordinate, systems, the, distance, between, the, points, will, be, the, same, for, both, assuming, that, they, are, measuring, using, the, same, units, the, distance, is, invariant, in, special, relativity, however, the, distance, between, two, points, is, no, longer, the, same, if, measured, by, two, different, observers, when, one, of, the, observers, is, moving, because, of, lorentz, contraction, the, situation, is, even, more, complicated, if, the, two, points, are, separated, in, time, as, well, as, in, space, for, example, if, one, observer, sees, two, events, occur, at, the, same, place, but, at, different, times, a, person, moving, with, respect, to, the, first, observer, will, see, the, two, events, occurring, at, different, places, because, the, moving, point, of, view, sees, itself, as, stationary, and, the, position, of, the, event, as, receding, or, approaching, thus, a, different, measure, must, be, used, to, measure, the, effective, distance, between, two, events, 48, 50, 100, 102, in, four, dimensional, spacetime, the, analog, to, distance, is, the, interval, although, time, comes, in, as, a, fourth, dimension, it, is, treated, differently, than, the, spatial, dimensions, minkowski, space, hence, differs, in, important, respects, from, four, dimensional, euclidean, space, the, fundamental, reason, for, merging, space, and, time, into, spacetime, is, that, space, and, time, are, separately, not, invariant, which, is, to, say, that, under, the, proper, conditions, different, observers, will, disagree, on, the, length, of, time, between, two, events, because, of, time, dilation, or, the, distance, between, the, two, events, because, of, length, contraction, special, relativity, provides, a, new, invariant, called, the, spacetime, interval, which, combines, distances, in, space, and, in, time, all, observers, who, measure, the, time, and, distance, between, any, two, events, will, end, up, computing, the, same, spacetime, interval, suppose, an, observer, measures, two, events, as, being, separated, in, time, by, t, displaystyle, delta, t, and, a, spatial, distance, x, displaystyle, delta, x, then, the, squared, spacetime, interval, s, 2, displaystyle, delta, s, 2, between, the, two, events, that, are, separated, by, a, distance, x, displaystyle, delta, x, in, space, and, by, c, t, c, t, displaystyle, delta, ct, c, delta, t, in, the, c, t, displaystyle, ct, coordinate, is, or, for, three, space, dimensions, the, constant, c, displaystyle, c, the, speed, of, light, converts, time, t, displaystyle, t, units, like, seconds, into, space, units, like, meters, the, squared, interval, s, 2, displaystyle, delta, s, 2, is, a, measure, of, separation, between, events, a, and, b, that, are, time, separated, and, in, addition, space, separated, either, because, there, are, two, separate, objects, undergoing, events, or, because, a, single, object, in, space, is, moving, inertially, between, its, events, the, separation, interval, is, the, difference, between, the, square, of, the, spatial, distance, separating, event, b, from, event, a, and, the, square, of, the, spatial, distance, traveled, by, a, light, signal, in, that, same, time, interval, t, displaystyle, delta, t, if, the, event, separation, is, due, to, a, light, signal, then, this, difference, vanishes, and, s, 0, displaystyle, delta, s, 0, when, the, event, considered, is, infinitesimally, close, to, each, other, then, we, may, write, in, a, different, inertial, frame, say, with, coordinates, t, x, y, z, displaystyle, t, x, y, z, the, spacetime, interval, d, s, displaystyle, ds, can, be, written, in, a, same, form, as, above, because, of, the, constancy, of, speed, of, light, the, light, events, in, all, inertial, frames, belong, to, zero, interval, d, s, d, s, 0, displaystyle, ds, ds, 0, for, any, other, infinitesimal, event, where, d, s, 0, displaystyle, ds, neq, 0, one, can, prove, that, d, s, 2, d, s, 2, displaystyle, ds, 2, ds, 2, which, in, turn, upon, integration, leads, to, s, s, displaystyle, s, s, 2, the, invariance, of, the, spacetime, interval, between, the, same, events, for, all, inertial, frames, of, reference, is, one, of, the, fundamental, results, of, special, theory, of, relativity, although, for, brevity, one, frequently, sees, interval, expressions, expressed, without, deltas, including, in, most, of, the, following, discussion, it, should, be, understood, that, in, general, x, displaystyle, x, means, x, displaystyle, delta, x, etc, we, are, always, concerned, with, differences, of, spatial, or, temporal, coordinate, values, belonging, to, two, events, and, since, there, is, no, preferred, origin, single, coordinate, values, have, no, essential, meaning, the, equation, above, is, similar, to, the, pythagorean, theorem, except, with, a, minus, sign, between, the, c, t, 2, displaystyle, ct, 2, and, the, x, 2, displaystyle, x, 2, terms, the, spacetime, interval, is, the, quantity, s, 2, displaystyle, s, 2, not, s, displaystyle, s, itself, the, reason, is, that, unlike, distances, in, euclidean, geometry, intervals, in, minkowski, spacetime, can, be, negative, rather, than, deal, with, square, roots, of, negative, numbers, physicists, customarily, regard, s, 2, displaystyle, s, 2, as, a, distinct, symbol, in, itself, rather, than, the, square, of, something, 217, in, general, s, 2, displaystyle, s, 2, can, assume, any, real, number, value, if, s, 2, displaystyle, s, 2, is, positive, the, spacetime, interval, is, referred, to, as, timelike, since, spatial, distance, traversed, by, any, massive, object, is, always, less, than, distance, traveled, by, the, light, for, the, same, time, interval, positive, intervals, are, always, timelike, if, s, 2, displaystyle, s, 2, is, negative, the, spacetime, interval, is, said, to, be, spacelike, spacetime, intervals, are, equal, to, zero, when, x, c, t, displaystyle, x, pm, ct, in, other, words, the, spacetime, interval, between, two, events, on, the, world, line, of, something, moving, at, the, speed, of, light, is, zero, such, an, interval, is, termed, lightlike, or, null, a, photon, arriving, in, our, eye, from, a, distant, star, will, not, have, aged, despite, having, from, our, perspective, spent, years, in, its, passage, 48, 50, a, spacetime, diagram, is, typically, drawn, with, only, a, single, space, and, a, single, time, coordinate, fig, 2, 1, presents, a, spacetime, diagram, illustrating, the, world, lines, i, e, paths, in, spacetime, of, two, photons, a, and, b, originating, from, the, same, event, and, going, in, opposite, directions, in, addition, c, illustrates, the, world, line, of, a, slower, than, light, speed, object, the, vertical, time, coordinate, is, scaled, by, c, displaystyle, c, so, that, it, has, the, same, units, meters, as, the, horizontal, space, coordinate, since, photons, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, their, world, lines, have, a, slope, of, 1, 23, 25, in, other, words, every, meter, that, a, photon, travels, to, the, left, or, right, requires, approximately, 3, 3, nanoseconds, of, time, to, gain, insight, in, how, spacetime, coordinates, measured, by, observers, in, different, reference, frames, compare, with, each, other, it, is, useful, to, work, with, a, simplified, setup, with, frames, in, a, standard, configuration, with, care, this, allows, simplification, of, the, math, with, no, loss, of, generality, in, the, conclusions, that, are, reached, in, fig, 2, 2, two, galilean, reference, frames, i, e, conventional, 3, space, frames, are, displayed, in, relative, motion, frame, s, belongs, to, a, first, observer, o, and, frame, s, pronounced, s, prime, belongs, to, a, second, observer, o, fig, 2, 3a, redraws, fig, 2, 2, in, a, different, orientation, fig, 2, 3b, illustrates, a, relativistic, spacetime, diagram, from, the, viewpoint, of, observer, o, since, s, and, s, are, in, standard, configuration, their, origins, coincide, at, times, t, 0, in, frame, s, and, t, 0, in, frame, s, the, ct, axis, passes, through, the, events, in, frame, s, which, have, x, 0, but, the, points, with, x, 0, are, moving, in, the, x, direction, of, frame, s, with, velocity, v, so, that, they, are, not, coincident, with, the, ct, axis, at, any, time, other, than, zero, therefore, the, ct, axis, is, tilted, with, respect, to, the, ct, axis, by, an, angle, given, by, 23, 31, the, x, axis, is, also, tilted, with, respect, to, the, x, axis, to, determine, the, angle, of, this, tilt, we, recall, that, the, slope, of, the, world, line, of, a, light, pulse, is, always, 1, fig, 2, 3c, presents, a, spacetime, diagram, from, the, viewpoint, of, observer, o, event, p, represents, the, emission, of, a, light, pulse, at, x, 0, ct, a, the, pulse, is, reflected, from, a, mirror, situated, a, distance, a, from, the, light, source, event, q, and, returns, to, the, light, source, at, x, 0, ct, a, event, r, the, same, events, p, q, r, are, plotted, in, fig, 2, 3b, in, the, frame, of, observer, o, the, light, paths, have, slopes, 1, and, 1, so, that, pqr, forms, a, right, triangle, with, pq, and, qr, both, at, 45, degrees, to, the, x, and, ct, axes, since, op, oq, or, the, angle, between, x, and, x, must, also, be, 113, 118, while, the, rest, frame, has, space, and, time, axes, that, meet, at, right, angles, the, moving, frame, is, drawn, with, axes, that, meet, at, an, acute, angle, the, frames, are, actually, equivalent, 23, 31, the, asymmetry, is, due, to, unavoidable, distortions, in, how, spacetime, coordinates, can, map, onto, a, cartesian, plane, and, should, be, considered, no, stranger, than, the, manner, in, which, on, a, mercator, projection, of, the, earth, the, relative, sizes, of, land, masses, near, the, poles, greenland, and, antarctica, are, highly, exaggerated, relative, to, land, masses, near, the, equator, in, fig, 2, 4, event, o, is, at, the, origin, of, a, spacetime, diagram, and, the, two, diagonal, lines, represent, all, events, that, have, zero, spacetime, interval, with, respect, to, the, origin, event, these, two, lines, form, what, is, called, the, light, cone, of, the, event, o, since, adding, a, second, spatial, dimension, fig, 2, 5, makes, the, appearance, that, of, two, right, circular, cones, meeting, with, their, apices, at, o, one, cone, extends, into, the, future, t, 0, the, other, into, the, past, t, 0, a, light, double, cone, divides, spacetime, into, separate, regions, with, respect, to, its, apex, the, interior, of, the, future, light, cone, consists, of, all, events, that, are, separated, from, the, apex, by, more, time, temporal, distance, than, necessary, to, cross, their, spatial, distance, at, lightspeed, these, events, comprise, the, timelike, future, of, the, event, o, likewise, the, timelike, past, comprises, the, interior, events, of, the, past, light, cone, so, in, timelike, intervals, ct, is, greater, than, x, making, timelike, intervals, positive, 220, the, region, exterior, to, the, light, cone, consists, of, events, that, are, separated, from, the, event, o, by, more, space, than, can, be, crossed, at, lightspeed, in, the, given, time, these, events, comprise, the, so, called, spacelike, region, of, the, event, o, denoted, elsewhere, in, fig, 2, 4, events, on, the, light, cone, itself, are, said, to, be, lightlike, or, null, separated, from, o, because, of, the, invariance, of, the, spacetime, interval, all, observers, will, assign, the, same, light, cone, to, any, given, event, and, thus, will, agree, on, this, division, of, spacetime, 220, the, light, cone, has, an, essential, role, within, the, concept, of, causality, it, is, possible, for, a, not, faster, than, light, speed, signal, to, travel, from, the, position, and, time, of, o, to, the, position, and, time, of, d, fig, 2, 4, it, is, hence, possible, for, event, o, to, have, a, causal, influence, on, event, d, the, future, light, cone, contains, all, the, events, that, could, be, causally, influenced, by, o, likewise, it, is, possible, for, a, not, faster, than, light, speed, signal, to, travel, from, the, position, and, time, of, a, to, the, position, and, time, of, o, the, past, light, cone, contains, all, the, events, that, could, have, a, causal, influence, on, o, in, contrast, assuming, that, signals, cannot, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, any, event, like, e, g, b, or, c, in, the, spacelike, region, elsewhere, cannot, either, affect, event, o, nor, can, they, be, affected, by, event, o, employing, such, signalling, under, this, assumption, any, causal, relationship, between, event, o, and, any, events, in, the, spacelike, region, of, a, light, cone, is, excluded, all, observers, will, agree, that, for, any, given, event, an, event, within, the, given, event, s, future, light, cone, occurs, after, the, given, event, likewise, for, any, given, event, an, event, within, the, given, event, s, past, light, cone, occurs, before, the, given, event, the, before, after, relationship, observed, for, timelike, separated, events, remains, unchanged, no, matter, what, the, reference, frame, of, the, observer, i, e, no, matter, how, the, observer, may, be, moving, the, situation, is, quite, different, for, spacelike, separated, events, fig, 2, 4, was, drawn, from, the, reference, frame, of, an, observer, moving, at, v, 0, from, this, reference, frame, event, c, is, observed, to, occur, after, event, o, and, event, b, is, observed, to, occur, before, event, o, from, a, different, reference, frame, the, orderings, of, these, non, causally, related, events, can, be, reversed, in, particular, one, notes, that, if, two, events, are, simultaneous, in, a, particular, reference, frame, they, are, necessarily, separated, by, a, spacelike, interval, and, thus, are, noncausally, related, the, observation, that, simultaneity, is, not, absolute, but, depends, on, the, observer, s, reference, frame, is, termed, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, fig, 2, 6, illustrates, the, use, of, spacetime, diagrams, in, the, analysis, of, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, the, events, in, spacetime, are, invariant, but, the, coordinate, frames, transform, as, discussed, above, for, fig, 2, 3, the, three, events, a, b, c, are, simultaneous, from, the, reference, frame, of, an, observer, moving, at, v, 0, from, the, reference, frame, of, an, observer, moving, at, v, 0, 3, c, the, events, appear, to, occur, in, the, order, c, b, a, from, the, reference, frame, of, an, observer, moving, at, v, 0, 5, c, the, events, appear, to, occur, in, the, order, a, b, c, the, white, line, represents, a, plane, of, simultaneity, being, moved, from, the, past, of, the, observer, to, the, future, of, the, observer, highlighting, events, residing, on, it, the, gray, area, is, the, light, cone, of, the, observer, which, remains, invariant, a, spacelike, spacetime, interval, gives, the, same, distance, that, an, observer, would, measure, if, the, events, being, measured, were, simultaneous, to, the, observer, a, spacelike, spacetime, interval, hence, provides, a, measure, of, proper, distance, i, e, the, true, distance, s, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, s, 2, likewise, a, timelike, spacetime, interval, gives, the, same, measure, of, time, as, would, be, presented, by, the, cumulative, ticking, of, a, clock, that, moves, along, a, given, world, line, a, timelike, spacetime, interval, hence, provides, a, measure, of, the, proper, time, s, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, s, 2, 220, 221, in, euclidean, space, having, spatial, dimensions, only, the, set, of, points, equidistant, using, the, euclidean, metric, from, some, point, form, a, circle, in, two, dimensions, or, a, sphere, in, three, dimensions, in, 1, 1, dimensional, minkowski, spacetime, having, one, temporal, and, one, spatial, dimension, the, points, at, some, constant, spacetime, interval, away, from, the, origin, using, the, minkowski, metric, form, curves, given, by, the, two, equations, with, s, 2, displaystyle, s, 2, some, positive, real, constant, these, equations, describe, two, families, of, hyperbolae, in, an, x, ct, spacetime, diagram, which, are, termed, invariant, hyperbolae, in, fig, 2, 7a, each, magenta, hyperbola, connects, all, events, having, some, fixed, spacelike, separation, from, the, origin, while, the, green, hyperbolae, connect, events, of, equal, timelike, separation, the, magenta, hyperbolae, which, cross, the, x, axis, are, timelike, curves, which, is, to, say, that, these, hyperbolae, represent, actual, paths, that, can, be, traversed, by, constantly, accelerating, particles, in, spacetime, between, any, two, events, on, one, hyperbola, a, causality, relation, is, possible, because, the, inverse, of, the, slope, representing, the, necessary, speed, for, all, secants, is, less, than, c, displaystyle, c, on, the, other, hand, the, green, hyperbolae, which, cross, the, ct, axis, are, spacelike, curves, because, all, intervals, along, these, hyperbolae, are, spacelike, intervals, no, causality, is, possible, between, any, two, points, on, one, of, these, hyperbolae, because, all, secants, represent, speeds, larger, than, c, displaystyle, c, fig, 2, 7b, reflects, the, situation, in, 1, 2, dimensional, minkowski, spacetime, one, temporal, and, two, spatial, dimensions, with, the, corresponding, hyperboloids, the, invariant, hyperbolae, displaced, by, spacelike, intervals, from, the, origin, generate, hyperboloids, of, one, sheet, while, the, invariant, hyperbolae, displaced, by, timelike, intervals, from, the, origin, generate, hyperboloids, of, two, sheets, the, 1, 2, dimensional, boundary, between, space, and, timelike, hyperboloids, established, by, the, events, forming, a, zero, spacetime, interval, to, the, origin, is, made, up, by, degenerating, the, hyperboloids, to, the, light, cone, in, 1, 1, dimensions, the, hyperbolae, degenerate, to, the, two, grey, 45, lines, depicted, in, fig, 2, 7a, fig, 2, 8, illustrates, the, invariant, hyperbola, for, all, events, that, can, be, reached, from, the, origin, in, a, proper, time, of, 5, meters, approximately, 1, 67, 10, 8, s, different, world, lines, represent, clocks, moving, at, different, speeds, a, clock, that, is, stationary, with, respect, to, the, observer, has, a, world, line, that, is, vertical, and, the, elapsed, time, measured, by, the, observer, is, the, same, as, the, proper, time, for, a, clock, traveling, at, 0, 3, c, the, elapsed, time, measured, by, the, observer, is, 5, 24, meters, 1, 75, 10, 8, s, while, for, a, clock, traveling, at, 0, 7, c, the, elapsed, time, measured, by, the, observer, is, 7, 00, meters, 2, 34, 10, 8, s, 220, 221, this, illustrates, the, phenomenon, known, as, time, dilation, clocks, that, travel, faster, take, longer, in, the, observer, frame, to, tick, out, the, same, amount, of, proper, time, and, they, travel, further, along, the, x, axis, within, that, proper, time, than, they, would, have, without, time, dilation, 220, 221, the, measurement, of, time, dilation, by, two, observers, in, different, inertial, reference, frames, is, mutual, if, observer, o, measures, the, clocks, of, observer, o, as, running, slower, in, his, frame, observer, o, in, turn, will, measure, the, clocks, of, observer, o, as, running, slower, length, contraction, like, time, dilation, is, a, manifestation, of, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, measurement, of, length, requires, measurement, of, the, spacetime, interval, between, two, events, that, are, simultaneous, in, one, s, frame, of, reference, but, events, that, are, simultaneous, in, one, frame, of, reference, are, in, general, not, simultaneous, in, other, frames, of, reference, fig, 2, 9, illustrates, the, motions, of, a, 1, m, rod, that, is, traveling, at, 0, 5, c, along, the, x, axis, the, edges, of, the, blue, band, represent, the, world, lines, of, the, rod, s, two, endpoints, the, invariant, hyperbola, illustrates, events, separated, from, the, origin, by, a, spacelike, interval, of, 1, m, the, endpoints, o, and, b, measured, when, t, 0, are, simultaneous, events, in, the, s, frame, but, to, an, observer, in, frame, s, events, o, and, b, are, not, simultaneous, to, measure, length, the, observer, in, frame, s, measures, the, endpoints, of, the, rod, as, projected, onto, the, x, axis, along, their, world, lines, the, projection, of, the, rod, s, world, sheet, onto, the, x, axis, yields, the, foreshortened, length, oc, 125, not, illustrated, drawing, a, vertical, line, through, a, so, that, it, intersects, the, x, axis, demonstrates, that, even, as, ob, is, foreshortened, from, the, point, of, view, of, observer, o, oa, is, likewise, foreshortened, from, the, point, of, view, of, observer, o, in, the, same, way, that, each, observer, measures, the, other, s, clocks, as, running, slow, each, observer, measures, the, other, s, rulers, as, being, contracted, in, regards, to, mutual, length, contraction, fig, 2, 9, illustrates, that, the, primed, and, unprimed, frames, are, mutually, rotated, by, a, hyperbolic, angle, analogous, to, ordinary, angles, in, euclidean, geometry, because, of, this, rotation, the, projection, of, a, primed, meter, stick, onto, the, unprimed, x, axis, is, foreshortened, while, the, projection, of, an, unprimed, meter, stick, onto, the, primed, x, axis, is, likewise, foreshortened, mutual, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, tend, to, strike, beginners, as, inherently, self, contradictory, concepts, if, an, observer, in, frame, s, measures, a, clock, at, rest, in, frame, s, as, running, slower, than, his, while, s, is, moving, at, speed, v, in, s, then, the, principle, of, relativity, requires, that, an, observer, in, frame, s, likewise, measures, a, clock, in, frame, s, moving, at, speed, v, in, s, as, running, slower, than, hers, how, two, clocks, can, run, both, slower, than, the, other, is, an, important, question, that, goes, to, the, heart, of, understanding, special, relativity, 198, this, apparent, contradiction, stems, from, not, correctly, taking, into, account, the, different, settings, of, the, necessary, related, measurements, these, settings, allow, for, a, consistent, explanation, of, the, only, apparent, contradiction, it, is, not, about, the, abstract, ticking, of, two, identical, clocks, but, about, how, to, measure, in, one, frame, the, temporal, distance, of, two, ticks, of, a, moving, clock, it, turns, out, that, in, mutually, observing, the, duration, between, ticks, of, clocks, each, moving, in, the, respective, frame, different, sets, of, clocks, must, be, involved, in, order, to, measure, in, frame, s, the, tick, duration, of, a, moving, clock, w, at, rest, in, s, one, uses, two, additional, synchronized, clocks, w, 1, and, w, 2, at, rest, in, two, arbitrarily, fixed, points, in, s, with, the, spatial, distance, d, conversely, for, judging, in, frame, s, the, temporal, distance, of, two, events, on, a, moving, clock, w, at, rest, in, s, one, needs, two, clocks, at, rest, in, s, the, necessary, recordings, for, the, two, judgements, with, one, moving, clock, and, two, clocks, at, rest, in, respectively, s, or, s, involves, two, different, sets, each, with, three, clocks, since, there, are, different, sets, of, clocks, involved, in, the, measurements, there, is, no, inherent, necessity, that, the, measurements, be, reciprocally, consistent, such, that, if, one, observer, measures, the, moving, clock, to, be, slow, the, other, observer, measures, the, one, s, clock, to, be, fast, 198, 199, fig, 2, 10, illustrates, the, previous, discussion, of, mutual, time, dilation, with, minkowski, diagrams, the, upper, picture, reflects, the, measurements, as, seen, from, frame, s, at, rest, with, unprimed, rectangular, axes, and, frame, s, moving, with, v, 0, coordinatized, by, primed, oblique, axes, slanted, to, the, right, the, lower, picture, shows, frame, s, at, rest, with, primed, rectangular, coordinates, and, frame, s, moving, with, v, 0, with, unprimed, oblique, axes, slanted, to, the, left, each, line, drawn, parallel, to, a, spatial, axis, x, x, represents, a, line, of, simultaneity, all, events, on, such, a, line, have, the, same, time, value, ct, ct, likewise, each, line, drawn, parallel, to, a, temporal, axis, ct, ct, represents, a, line, of, equal, spatial, coordinate, values, x, x, to, show, the, mutual, time, dilation, immediately, in, the, upper, picture, the, event, d, may, be, constructed, as, the, event, at, x, 0, the, location, of, clock, w, in, s, that, is, simultaneous, to, c, oc, has, equal, spacetime, interval, as, oa, in, s, this, shows, that, the, time, interval, od, is, longer, than, oa, showing, that, the, moving, clock, runs, slower, 124, in, the, lower, picture, the, frame, s, is, moving, with, velocity, v, in, the, frame, s, at, rest, the, worldline, of, clock, w, is, the, ct, axis, slanted, to, the, left, the, worldline, of, w, 1, is, the, vertical, ct, axis, and, the, worldline, of, w, 2, is, the, vertical, through, event, c, with, ct, coordinate, d, the, invariant, hyperbola, through, event, c, scales, the, time, interval, oc, to, oa, which, is, shorter, than, od, also, b, is, constructed, similar, to, d, in, the, upper, pictures, as, simultaneous, to, a, in, s, at, x, 0, the, result, ob, oc, corresponds, again, to, above, the, word, measure, is, important, in, classical, physics, an, observer, cannot, affect, an, observed, object, but, the, object, s, state, of, motion, can, affect, the, observer, s, observations, of, the, object, many, introductions, to, special, relativity, illustrate, the, differences, between, galilean, relativity, and, special, relativity, by, posing, a, series, of, paradoxes, these, paradoxes, are, in, fact, ill, posed, problems, resulting, from, our, unfamiliarity, with, velocities, comparable, to, the, speed, of, light, the, remedy, is, to, solve, many, problems, in, special, relativity, and, to, become, familiar, with, its, so, called, counter, intuitive, predictions, the, geometrical, approach, to, studying, spacetime, is, considered, one, of, the, best, methods, for, developing, a, modern, intuition, the, twin, paradox, is, a, thought, experiment, involving, identical, twins, one, of, whom, makes, a, journey, into, space, in, a, high, speed, rocket, returning, home, to, find, that, the, twin, who, remained, on, earth, has, aged, more, this, result, appears, puzzling, because, each, twin, observes, the, other, twin, as, moving, and, so, at, first, glance, it, would, appear, that, each, should, find, the, other, to, have, aged, less, the, twin, paradox, sidesteps, the, justification, for, mutual, time, dilation, presented, above, by, avoiding, the, requirement, for, a, third, clock, 207, nevertheless, the, twin, paradox, is, not, a, true, paradox, because, it, is, easily, understood, within, the, context, of, special, relativity, the, impression, that, a, paradox, exists, stems, from, a, misunderstanding, of, what, special, relativity, states, special, relativity, does, not, declare, all, frames, of, reference, to, be, equivalent, only, inertial, frames, the, traveling, twin, s, frame, is, not, inertial, during, periods, when, she, is, accelerating, furthermore, the, difference, between, the, twins, is, observationally, detectable, the, traveling, twin, needs, to, fire, her, rockets, to, be, able, to, return, home, while, the, stay, at, home, twin, does, not, these, distinctions, should, result, in, a, difference, in, the, twins, ages, the, spacetime, diagram, of, fig, 2, 11, presents, the, simple, case, of, a, twin, going, straight, out, along, the, x, axis, and, immediately, turning, back, from, the, standpoint, of, the, stay, at, home, twin, there, is, nothing, puzzling, about, the, twin, paradox, at, all, the, proper, time, measured, along, the, traveling, twin, s, world, line, from, o, to, c, plus, the, proper, time, measured, from, c, to, b, is, less, than, the, stay, at, home, twin, s, proper, time, measured, from, o, to, a, to, b, more, complex, trajectories, require, integrating, the, proper, time, between, the, respective, events, along, the, curve, i, e, the, path, integral, to, calculate, the, total, amount, of, proper, time, experienced, by, the, traveling, twin, complications, arise, if, the, twin, paradox, is, analyzed, from, the, traveling, twin, s, point, of, view, weiss, s, nomenclature, designating, the, stay, at, home, twin, as, terence, and, the, traveling, twin, as, stella, is, hereafter, used, stella, is, not, in, an, inertial, frame, given, this, fact, it, is, sometimes, incorrectly, stated, that, full, resolution, of, the, twin, paradox, requires, general, relativity, a, pure, sr, analysis, would, be, as, follows, analyzed, in, stella, s, rest, frame, she, is, motionless, for, the, entire, trip, when, she, fires, her, rockets, for, the, turnaround, she, experiences, a, pseudo, force, which, resembles, a, gravitational, force, figs, 2, 6, and, 2, 11, illustrate, the, concept, of, lines, planes, of, simultaneity, lines, parallel, to, the, observer, s, x, axis, xy, plane, represent, sets, of, events, that, are, simultaneous, in, the, observer, frame, in, fig, 2, 11, the, blue, lines, connect, events, on, terence, s, world, line, which, from, stella, s, point, of, view, are, simultaneous, with, events, on, her, world, line, terence, in, turn, would, observe, a, set, of, horizontal, lines, of, simultaneity, throughout, both, the, outbound, and, the, inbound, legs, of, stella, s, journey, she, measures, terence, s, clocks, as, running, slower, than, her, own, but, during, the, turnaround, i, e, between, the, bold, blue, lines, in, the, figure, a, shift, takes, place, in, the, angle, of, her, lines, of, simultaneity, corresponding, to, a, rapid, skip, over, of, the, events, in, terence, s, world, line, that, stella, considers, to, be, simultaneous, with, her, own, therefore, at, the, end, of, her, trip, stella, finds, that, terence, has, aged, more, than, she, has, although, general, relativity, is, not, required, to, analyze, the, twin, paradox, application, of, the, equivalence, principle, of, general, relativity, does, provide, some, additional, insight, into, the, subject, stella, is, not, stationary, in, an, inertial, frame, analyzed, in, stella, s, rest, frame, she, is, motionless, for, the, entire, trip, when, she, is, coasting, her, rest, frame, is, inertial, and, terence, s, clock, will, appear, to, run, slow, but, when, she, fires, her, rockets, for, the, turnaround, her, rest, frame, is, an, accelerated, frame, and, she, experiences, a, force, which, is, pushing, her, as, if, she, were, in, a, gravitational, field, terence, will, appear, to, be, high, up, in, that, field, and, because, of, gravitational, time, dilation, his, clock, will, appear, to, run, fast, so, much, so, that, the, net, result, will, be, that, terence, has, aged, more, than, stella, when, they, are, back, together, the, theoretical, arguments, predicting, gravitational, time, dilation, are, not, exclusive, to, general, relativity, any, theory, of, gravity, will, predict, gravitational, time, dilation, if, it, respects, the, principle, of, equivalence, including, newton, s, theory, 16, this, introductory, section, has, focused, on, the, spacetime, of, special, relativity, since, it, is, the, easiest, to, describe, minkowski, spacetime, is, flat, takes, no, account, of, gravity, is, uniform, throughout, and, serves, as, nothing, more, than, a, static, background, for, the, events, that, take, place, in, it, the, presence, of, gravity, greatly, complicates, the, description, of, spacetime, in, general, relativity, spacetime, is, no, longer, a, static, background, but, actively, interacts, with, the, physical, systems, that, it, contains, spacetime, curves, in, the, presence, of, matter, can, propagate, waves, bends, light, and, exhibits, a, host, of, other, phenomena, 221, a, few, of, these, phenomena, are, described, in, the, later, sections, of, this, article, a, basic, goal, is, to, be, able, to, compare, measurements, made, by, observers, in, relative, motion, if, there, is, an, observer, o, in, frame, s, who, has, measured, the, time, and, space, coordinates, of, an, event, assigning, this, event, three, cartesian, coordinates, and, the, time, as, measured, on, his, lattice, of, synchronized, clocks, x, y, z, t, see, fig, 1, 1, a, second, observer, o, in, a, different, frame, s, measures, the, same, event, in, her, coordinate, system, and, her, lattice, of, synchronized, clocks, x, y, z, t, with, inertial, frames, neither, observer, is, under, acceleration, and, a, simple, set, of, equations, allows, us, to, relate, coordinates, x, y, z, t, to, x, y, z, t, given, that, the, two, coordinate, systems, are, in, standard, configuration, meaning, that, they, are, aligned, with, parallel, x, y, z, coordinates, and, that, t, 0, when, t, 0, the, coordinate, transformation, is, as, follows, fig, 3, 1, illustrates, that, in, newton, s, theory, time, is, universal, not, the, velocity, of, light, 36, 37, consider, the, following, thought, experiment, the, red, arrow, illustrates, a, train, that, is, moving, at, 0, 4, c, with, respect, to, the, platform, within, the, train, a, passenger, shoots, a, bullet, with, a, speed, of, 0, 4, c, in, the, frame, of, the, train, the, blue, arrow, illustrates, that, a, person, standing, on, the, train, tracks, measures, the, bullet, as, traveling, at, 0, 8, c, this, is, in, accordance, with, our, naive, expectations, more, generally, assuming, that, frame, s, is, moving, at, velocity, v, with, respect, to, frame, s, then, within, frame, s, observer, o, measures, an, object, moving, with, velocity, u, velocity, u, with, respect, to, frame, s, since, x, ut, x, x, vt, and, t, t, can, be, written, as, x, ut, vt, u, v, t, u, v, t, this, leads, to, u, x, t, and, ultimately, which, is, the, common, sense, galilean, law, for, the, addition, of, velocities, the, composition, of, velocities, is, quite, different, in, relativistic, spacetime, to, reduce, the, complexity, of, the, equations, slightly, we, introduce, a, common, shorthand, for, the, ratio, of, the, speed, of, an, object, relative, to, light, fig, 3, 2a, illustrates, a, red, train, that, is, moving, forward, at, a, speed, given, by, v, c, s, a, from, the, primed, frame, of, the, train, a, passenger, shoots, a, bullet, with, a, speed, given, by, u, c, n, m, where, the, distance, is, measured, along, a, line, parallel, to, the, red, x, axis, rather, than, parallel, to, the, black, x, axis, what, is, the, composite, velocity, u, of, the, bullet, relative, to, the, platform, as, represented, by, the, blue, arrow, referring, to, fig, 3, 2b, the, relativistic, formula, for, addition, of, velocities, presented, above, exhibits, several, important, features, it, is, straightforward, to, obtain, quantitative, expressions, for, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, fig, 3, 3, is, a, composite, image, containing, individual, frames, taken, from, two, previous, animations, simplified, and, relabeled, for, the, purposes, of, this, section, to, reduce, the, complexity, of, the, equations, slightly, there, are, a, variety, of, different, shorthand, notations, for, ct, in, fig, 3, 3a, segments, oa, and, ok, represent, equal, spacetime, intervals, time, dilation, is, represented, by, the, ratio, ob, ok, the, invariant, hyperbola, has, the, equation, w, x, 2, k, 2, where, k, ok, and, the, red, line, representing, the, world, line, of, a, particle, in, motion, has, the, equation, w, x, xc, v, a, bit, of, algebraic, manipulation, yields, o, b, o, k, 1, v, 2, c, 2, textstyle, ob, ok, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, the, expression, involving, the, square, root, symbol, appears, very, frequently, in, relativity, and, one, over, the, expression, is, called, the, lorentz, factor, denoted, by, the, greek, letter, gamma, displaystyle, gamma, if, v, is, greater, than, or, equal, to, c, the, expression, for, displaystyle, gamma, becomes, physically, meaningless, implying, that, c, is, the, maximum, possible, speed, in, nature, for, any, v, greater, than, zero, the, lorentz, factor, will, be, greater, than, one, although, the, shape, of, the, curve, is, such, that, for, low, speeds, the, lorentz, factor, is, extremely, close, to, one, in, fig, 3, 3b, segments, oa, and, ok, represent, equal, spacetime, intervals, length, contraction, is, represented, by, the, ratio, ob, ok, the, invariant, hyperbola, has, the, equation, x, w, 2, k, 2, where, k, ok, and, the, edges, of, the, blue, band, representing, the, world, lines, of, the, endpoints, of, a, rod, in, motion, have, slope, 1, c, v, event, a, has, coordinates, x, w, k, k, since, the, tangent, line, through, a, and, b, has, the, equation, w, x, ob, we, have, k, k, ob, and, the, galilean, transformations, and, their, consequent, commonsense, law, of, addition, of, velocities, work, well, in, our, ordinary, low, speed, world, of, planes, cars, and, balls, beginning, in, the, mid, 1800s, however, sensitive, scientific, instrumentation, began, finding, anomalies, that, did, not, fit, well, with, the, ordinary, addition, of, velocities, lorentz, transformations, are, used, to, transform, the, coordinates, of, an, event, from, one, frame, to, another, in, special, relativity, the, lorentz, factor, appears, in, the, lorentz, transformations, the, inverse, lorentz, transformations, are, when, v, c, and, x, is, small, enough, the, v, 2, c, 2, and, vx, c, 2, terms, approach, zero, and, the, lorentz, transformations, approximate, to, the, galilean, transformations, t, t, v, x, c, 2, displaystyle, t, gamma, t, vx, c, 2, x, x, v, t, displaystyle, x, gamma, x, vt, etc, most, often, really, mean, t, t, v, x, c, 2, displaystyle, delta, t, gamma, delta, t, v, delta, x, c, 2, x, x, v, t, displaystyle, delta, x, gamma, delta, x, v, delta, t, etc, although, for, brevity, the, lorentz, transformation, equations, are, written, without, deltas, x, means, x, etc, we, are, in, general, always, concerned, with, the, space, and, time, differences, between, events, calling, one, set, of, transformations, the, normal, lorentz, transformations, and, the, other, the, inverse, transformations, is, misleading, since, there, is, no, intrinsic, difference, between, the, frames, different, authors, call, one, or, the, other, set, of, transformations, the, inverse, set, the, forwards, and, inverse, transformations, are, trivially, related, to, each, other, since, the, s, frame, can, only, be, moving, forwards, or, reverse, with, respect, to, s, so, inverting, the, equations, simply, entails, switching, the, primed, and, unprimed, variables, and, replacing, v, with, v, 71, 79, example, terence, and, stella, are, at, an, earth, to, mars, space, race, terence, is, an, official, at, the, starting, line, while, stella, is, a, participant, at, time, t, t, 0, stella, s, spaceship, accelerates, instantaneously, to, a, speed, of, 0, 5, c, the, distance, from, earth, to, mars, is, 300, light, seconds, about, 90, 0, 10, 6, km, terence, observes, stella, crossing, the, finish, line, clock, at, t, 600, 00, s, but, stella, observes, the, time, on, her, ship, chronometer, to, be, t, t, v, x, c, 2, 519, 62, s, displaystyle, t, prime, gamma, left, t, vx, c, 2, right, 519, 62, text, s, as, she, passes, the, finish, line, and, she, calculates, the, distance, between, the, starting, and, finish, lines, as, measured, in, her, frame, to, be, 259, 81, light, seconds, about, 77, 9, 10, 6, km, 1, there, have, been, many, dozens, of, derivations, of, the, lorentz, transformations, since, einstein, s, original, work, in, 1905, each, with, its, particular, focus, although, einstein, s, derivation, was, based, on, the, invariance, of, the, speed, of, light, there, are, other, physical, principles, that, may, serve, as, starting, points, ultimately, these, alternative, starting, points, can, be, considered, different, expressions, of, the, underlying, principle, of, locality, which, states, that, the, influence, that, one, particle, exerts, on, another, can, not, be, transmitted, instantaneously, the, derivation, given, here, and, illustrated, in, fig, 3, 5, is, based, on, one, presented, by, bais, 64, 66, and, makes, use, of, previous, results, from, the, relativistic, composition, of, velocities, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, sections, event, p, has, coordinates, w, x, in, the, black, rest, system, and, coordinates, w, x, in, the, red, frame, that, is, moving, with, velocity, parameter, v, c, to, determine, w, and, x, in, terms, of, w, and, x, or, the, other, way, around, it, is, easier, at, first, to, derive, the, inverse, lorentz, transformation, the, above, equations, are, alternate, expressions, for, the, t, and, x, equations, of, the, inverse, lorentz, transformation, as, can, be, seen, by, substituting, ct, for, w, ct, for, w, and, v, c, for, from, the, inverse, transformation, the, equations, of, the, forwards, transformation, can, be, derived, by, solving, for, t, and, x, the, lorentz, transformations, have, a, mathematical, property, called, linearity, since, x, and, t, are, obtained, as, linear, combinations, of, x, and, t, with, no, higher, powers, involved, the, linearity, of, the, transformation, reflects, a, fundamental, property, of, spacetime, that, was, tacitly, assumed, in, the, derivation, namely, that, the, properties, of, inertial, frames, of, reference, are, independent, of, location, and, time, in, the, absence, of, gravity, spacetime, looks, the, same, everywhere, 67, all, inertial, observers, will, agree, on, what, constitutes, accelerating, and, non, accelerating, motion, 72, 73, any, one, observer, can, use, her, own, measurements, of, space, and, time, but, there, is, nothing, absolute, about, them, another, observer, s, conventions, will, do, just, as, well, 190, a, result, of, linearity, is, that, if, two, lorentz, transformations, are, applied, sequentially, the, result, is, also, a, lorentz, transformation, example, terence, observes, stella, speeding, away, from, him, at, 0, 500, c, and, he, can, use, the, lorentz, transformations, with, 0, 500, to, relate, stella, s, measurements, to, his, own, stella, in, her, frame, observes, ursula, traveling, away, from, her, at, 0, 250, c, and, she, can, use, the, lorentz, transformations, with, 0, 250, to, relate, ursula, s, measurements, with, her, own, because, of, the, linearity, of, the, transformations, and, the, relativistic, composition, of, velocities, terence, can, use, the, lorentz, transformations, with, 0, 666, to, relate, ursula, s, measurements, with, his, own, the, doppler, effect, is, the, change, in, frequency, or, wavelength, of, a, wave, for, a, receiver, and, source, in, relative, motion, for, simplicity, we, consider, here, two, basic, scenarios, 1, the, motions, of, the, source, and, or, receiver, are, exactly, along, the, line, connecting, them, longitudinal, doppler, effect, and, 2, the, motions, are, at, right, angles, to, the, said, line, transverse, doppler, effect, we, are, ignoring, scenarios, where, they, move, along, intermediate, angles, the, classical, doppler, analysis, deals, with, waves, that, are, propagating, in, a, medium, such, as, sound, waves, or, water, ripples, and, which, are, transmitted, between, sources, and, receivers, that, are, moving, towards, or, away, from, each, other, the, analysis, of, such, waves, depends, on, whether, the, source, the, receiver, or, both, are, moving, relative, to, the, medium, given, the, scenario, where, the, receiver, is, stationary, with, respect, to, the, medium, and, the, source, is, moving, directly, away, from, the, receiver, at, a, speed, of, v, s, for, a, velocity, parameter, of, s, the, wavelength, is, increased, and, the, observed, frequency, f, is, given, by, on, the, other, hand, given, the, scenario, where, source, is, stationary, and, the, receiver, is, moving, directly, away, from, the, source, at, a, speed, of, v, r, for, a, velocity, parameter, of, r, the, wavelength, is, not, changed, but, the, transmission, velocity, of, the, waves, relative, to, the, receiver, is, decreased, and, the, observed, frequency, f, is, given, by, light, unlike, sound, or, water, ripples, does, not, propagate, through, a, medium, and, there, is, no, distinction, between, a, source, moving, away, from, the, receiver, or, a, receiver, moving, away, from, the, source, fig, 3, 6, illustrates, a, relativistic, spacetime, diagram, showing, a, source, separating, from, the, receiver, with, a, velocity, parameter, displaystyle, beta, so, that, the, separation, between, source, and, receiver, at, time, w, displaystyle, w, is, w, displaystyle, beta, w, because, of, time, dilation, w, w, displaystyle, w, gamma, w, since, the, slope, of, the, green, light, ray, is, 1, t, w, w, w, 1, displaystyle, t, w, beta, w, gamma, w, 1, beta, hence, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, is, given, by, 58, 59, suppose, that, a, source, and, a, receiver, both, approaching, each, other, in, uniform, inertial, motion, along, non, intersecting, lines, are, at, their, closest, approach, to, each, other, it, would, appear, that, the, classical, analysis, predicts, that, the, receiver, detects, no, doppler, shift, due, to, subtleties, in, the, analysis, that, expectation, is, not, necessarily, true, nevertheless, when, appropriately, defined, transverse, doppler, shift, is, a, relativistic, effect, that, has, no, classical, analog, the, subtleties, are, these, 541, 543, two, other, scenarios, are, commonly, examined, in, discussions, of, transverse, doppler, shift, end, plainlist, in, scenario, a, the, point, of, closest, approach, is, frame, independent, and, represents, the, moment, where, there, is, no, change, in, distance, versus, time, i, e, dr, dt, 0, where, r, is, the, distance, between, receiver, and, source, and, hence, no, longitudinal, doppler, shift, the, source, observes, the, receiver, as, being, illuminated, by, light, of, frequency, f, but, also, observes, the, receiver, as, having, a, time, dilated, clock, in, frame, s, the, receiver, is, therefore, illuminated, by, blueshifted, light, of, frequency, in, scenario, b, the, illustration, shows, the, receiver, being, illuminated, by, light, from, when, the, source, was, closest, to, the, receiver, even, though, the, source, has, moved, on, because, the, source, s, clocks, are, time, dilated, as, measured, in, frame, s, and, since, dr, dt, was, equal, to, zero, at, this, point, the, light, from, the, source, emitted, from, this, closest, point, is, redshifted, with, frequency, scenarios, c, and, d, can, be, analyzed, by, simple, time, dilation, arguments, in, c, the, receiver, observes, light, from, the, source, as, being, blueshifted, by, a, factor, of, displaystyle, gamma, and, in, d, the, light, is, redshifted, the, only, seeming, complication, is, that, the, orbiting, objects, are, in, accelerated, motion, however, if, an, inertial, observer, looks, at, an, accelerating, clock, only, the, clock, s, instantaneous, speed, is, important, when, computing, time, dilation, the, converse, however, is, not, true, 541, 543, most, reports, of, transverse, doppler, shift, refer, to, the, effect, as, a, redshift, and, analyze, the, effect, in, terms, of, scenarios, b, or, d, in, classical, mechanics, the, state, of, motion, of, a, particle, is, characterized, by, its, mass, and, its, velocity, linear, momentum, the, product, of, a, particle, s, mass, and, velocity, is, a, vector, quantity, possessing, the, same, direction, as, the, velocity, p, m, v, it, is, a, conserved, quantity, meaning, that, if, a, closed, system, is, not, affected, by, external, forces, its, total, linear, momentum, cannot, change, in, relativistic, mechanics, the, momentum, vector, is, extended, to, four, dimensions, added, to, the, momentum, vector, is, a, time, component, that, allows, the, spacetime, momentum, vector, to, transform, like, the, spacetime, position, vector, x, t, displaystyle, x, t, in, exploring, the, properties, of, the, spacetime, momentum, we, start, in, fig, 3, 8a, by, examining, what, a, particle, looks, like, at, rest, in, the, rest, frame, the, spatial, component, of, the, momentum, is, zero, i, e, p, 0, but, the, time, component, equals, mc, we, can, obtain, the, transformed, components, of, this, vector, in, the, moving, frame, by, using, the, lorentz, transformations, or, we, can, read, it, directly, from, the, figure, because, we, know, that, m, c, m, c, displaystyle, mc, prime, gamma, mc, and, p, m, c, displaystyle, p, prime, beta, gamma, mc, since, the, red, axes, are, rescaled, by, gamma, fig, 3, 8b, illustrates, the, situation, as, it, appears, in, the, moving, frame, it, is, apparent, that, the, space, and, time, components, of, the, four, momentum, go, to, infinity, as, the, velocity, of, the, moving, frame, approaches, c, 84, 87, we, will, use, this, information, shortly, to, obtain, an, expression, for, the, four, momentum, light, particles, or, photons, travel, at, the, speed, of, c, the, constant, that, is, conventionally, known, as, the, speed, of, light, this, statement, is, not, a, tautology, since, many, modern, formulations, of, relativity, do, not, start, with, constant, speed, of, light, as, a, postulate, photons, therefore, propagate, along, a, lightlike, world, line, and, in, appropriate, units, have, equal, space, and, time, components, for, every, observer, a, consequence, of, maxwell, s, theory, of, electromagnetism, is, that, light, carries, energy, and, momentum, and, that, their, ratio, is, a, constant, e, p, c, displaystyle, e, p, c, rearranging, e, c, p, displaystyle, e, c, p, and, since, for, photons, the, space, and, time, components, are, equal, e, c, must, therefore, be, equated, with, the, time, component, of, the, spacetime, momentum, vector, photons, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, yet, have, finite, momentum, and, energy, for, this, to, be, so, the, mass, term, in, mc, must, be, zero, meaning, that, photons, are, massless, particles, infinity, times, zero, is, an, ill, defined, quantity, but, e, c, is, well, defined, by, this, analysis, if, the, energy, of, a, photon, equals, e, in, the, rest, frame, it, equals, e, 1, e, displaystyle, e, prime, 1, beta, gamma, e, in, a, moving, frame, this, result, can, be, derived, by, inspection, of, fig, 3, 9, or, by, application, of, the, lorentz, transformations, and, is, consistent, with, the, analysis, of, doppler, effect, given, previously, 88, consideration, of, the, interrelationships, between, the, various, components, of, the, relativistic, momentum, vector, led, einstein, to, several, important, conclusions, another, way, of, looking, at, the, relationship, between, mass, and, energy, is, to, consider, a, series, expansion, of, mc, 2, at, low, velocity, the, second, term, is, just, an, expression, for, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, mass, indeed, appears, to, be, another, form, of, energy, 90, 92, 129, 130, 180, the, concept, of, relativistic, mass, that, einstein, introduced, in, 1905, m, rel, although, amply, validated, every, day, in, particle, accelerators, around, the, globe, or, indeed, in, any, instrumentation, whose, use, depends, on, high, velocity, particles, such, as, electron, microscopes, old, fashioned, color, television, sets, etc, has, nevertheless, not, proven, to, be, a, fruitful, concept, in, physics, in, the, sense, that, it, is, not, a, concept, that, has, served, as, a, basis, for, other, theoretical, development, relativistic, mass, for, instance, plays, no, role, in, general, relativity, for, this, reason, as, well, as, for, pedagogical, concerns, most, physicists, currently, prefer, a, different, terminology, when, referring, to, the, relationship, between, mass, and, energy, relativistic, mass, is, a, deprecated, term, the, term, mass, by, itself, refers, to, the, rest, mass, or, invariant, mass, and, is, equal, to, the, invariant, length, of, the, relativistic, momentum, vector, expressed, as, a, formula, this, formula, applies, to, all, particles, massless, as, well, as, massive, for, photons, where, m, rest, equals, zero, it, yields, e, p, c, displaystyle, e, pm, pc, 90, 92, because, of, the, close, relationship, between, mass, and, energy, the, four, momentum, also, called, 4, momentum, is, also, called, the, energy, momentum, 4, vector, using, an, uppercase, p, to, represent, the, four, momentum, and, a, lowercase, p, to, denote, the, spatial, momentum, the, four, momentum, may, be, written, as, in, physics, conservation, laws, state, that, certain, particular, measurable, properties, of, an, isolated, physical, system, do, not, change, as, the, system, evolves, over, time, in, 1915, emmy, noether, discovered, that, underlying, each, conservation, law, is, a, fundamental, symmetry, of, nature, the, fact, that, physical, processes, do, not, care, where, in, space, they, take, place, space, translation, symmetry, yields, conservation, of, momentum, the, fact, that, such, processes, do, not, care, when, they, take, place, time, translation, symmetry, yields, conservation, of, energy, and, so, on, in, this, section, we, examine, the, newtonian, views, of, conservation, of, mass, momentum, and, energy, from, a, relativistic, perspective, to, understand, how, the, newtonian, view, of, conservation, of, momentum, needs, to, be, modified, in, a, relativistic, context, we, examine, the, problem, of, two, colliding, bodies, limited, to, a, single, dimension, in, newtonian, mechanics, two, extreme, cases, of, this, problem, may, be, distinguished, yielding, mathematics, of, minimum, complexity, for, both, cases, 1, and, 2, momentum, mass, and, total, energy, are, conserved, however, kinetic, energy, is, not, conserved, in, cases, of, inelastic, collision, a, certain, fraction, of, the, initial, kinetic, energy, is, converted, to, heat, in, case, 2, two, masses, with, momentums, p, 1, m, 1, v, 1, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, boldsymbol, 1, m, 1, boldsymbol, v, boldsymbol, 1, and, p, 2, m, 2, v, 2, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, boldsymbol, 2, m, 2, boldsymbol, v, boldsymbol, 2, collide, to, produce, a, single, particle, of, conserved, mass, m, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, m, m, 1, m, 2, traveling, at, the, center, of, mass, velocity, of, the, original, system, v, c, m, m, 1, v, 1, m, 2, v, 2, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, boldsymbol, v, cm, left, m, 1, boldsymbol, v, 1, m, 2, boldsymbol, v, 2, right, left, m, 1, m, 2, right, the, total, momentum, p, p, 1, p, 2, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, p, 1, p, 2, is, conserved, fig, 3, 10, illustrates, the, inelastic, collision, of, two, particles, from, a, relativistic, perspective, the, time, components, e, 1, c, displaystyle, e, 1, c, and, e, 2, c, displaystyle, e, 2, c, add, up, to, total, e, c, of, the, resultant, vector, meaning, that, energy, is, conserved, likewise, the, space, components, p, 1, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, 1, and, p, 2, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, 2, add, up, to, form, p, of, the, resultant, vector, the, four, momentum, is, as, expected, a, conserved, quantity, however, the, invariant, mass, of, the, fused, particle, given, by, the, point, where, the, invariant, hyperbola, of, the, total, momentum, intersects, the, energy, axis, is, not, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, invariant, masses, of, the, individual, particles, that, collided, indeed, it, is, larger, than, the, sum, of, the, individual, masses, m, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, m, m, 1, m, 2, 94, 97, looking, at, the, events, of, this, scenario, in, reverse, sequence, we, see, that, non, conservation, of, mass, is, a, common, occurrence, when, an, unstable, elementary, particle, spontaneously, decays, into, two, lighter, particles, total, energy, is, conserved, but, the, mass, is, not, part, of, the, mass, is, converted, into, kinetic, energy, 134, 138, the, freedom, to, choose, any, frame, in, which, to, perform, an, analysis, allows, us, to, pick, one, which, may, be, particularly, convenient, for, analysis, of, momentum, and, energy, problems, the, most, convenient, frame, is, usually, the, center, of, momentum, frame, also, called, the, zero, momentum, frame, or, com, frame, this, is, the, frame, in, which, the, space, component, of, the, system, s, total, momentum, is, zero, fig, 3, 11, illustrates, the, breakup, of, a, high, speed, particle, into, two, daughter, particles, in, the, lab, frame, the, daughter, particles, are, preferentially, emitted, in, a, direction, oriented, along, the, original, particle, s, trajectory, in, the, com, frame, however, the, two, daughter, particles, are, emitted, in, opposite, directions, although, their, masses, and, the, magnitude, of, their, velocities, are, generally, not, the, same, in, a, newtonian, analysis, of, interacting, particles, transformation, between, frames, is, simple, because, all, that, is, necessary, is, to, apply, the, galilean, transformation, to, all, velocities, since, v, v, u, displaystyle, v, v, u, the, momentum, p, p, m, u, displaystyle, p, p, mu, if, the, total, momentum, of, an, interacting, system, of, particles, is, observed, to, be, conserved, in, one, frame, it, will, likewise, be, observed, to, be, conserved, in, any, other, frame, 241, 245, conservation, of, momentum, in, the, com, frame, amounts, to, the, requirement, that, p, 0, both, before, and, after, collision, in, the, newtonian, analysis, conservation, of, mass, dictates, that, m, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, m, m, 1, m, 2, in, the, simplified, one, dimensional, scenarios, that, we, have, been, considering, only, one, additional, constraint, is, necessary, before, the, outgoing, momenta, of, the, particles, can, be, determined, an, energy, condition, in, the, one, dimensional, case, of, a, completely, elastic, collision, with, no, loss, of, kinetic, energy, the, outgoing, velocities, of, the, rebounding, particles, in, the, com, frame, will, be, precisely, equal, and, opposite, to, their, incoming, velocities, in, the, case, of, a, completely, inelastic, collision, with, total, loss, of, kinetic, energy, the, outgoing, velocities, of, the, rebounding, particles, will, be, zero, 241, 245, newtonian, momenta, calculated, as, p, m, v, displaystyle, p, mv, fail, to, behave, properly, under, lorentzian, transformation, the, linear, transformation, of, velocities, v, v, u, displaystyle, v, v, u, is, replaced, by, the, highly, nonlinear, v, v, u, 1, v, u, c, 2, displaystyle, v, prime, v, u, 1, vu, c, 2, so, that, a, calculation, demonstrating, conservation, of, momentum, in, one, frame, will, be, invalid, in, other, frames, einstein, was, faced, with, either, having, to, give, up, conservation, of, momentum, or, to, change, the, definition, of, momentum, this, second, option, was, what, he, chose, 104, the, relativistic, conservation, law, for, energy, and, momentum, replaces, the, three, classical, conservation, laws, for, energy, momentum, and, mass, mass, is, no, longer, conserved, independently, because, it, has, been, subsumed, into, the, total, relativistic, energy, this, makes, the, relativistic, conservation, of, energy, a, simpler, concept, than, in, nonrelativistic, mechanics, because, the, total, energy, is, conserved, without, any, qualifications, kinetic, energy, converted, into, heat, or, internal, potential, energy, shows, up, as, an, increase, in, mass, 127, fig, 3, 12a, illustrates, the, energy, momentum, diagram, for, this, decay, reaction, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, pion, because, of, its, negligible, mass, a, neutrino, travels, at, very, nearly, the, speed, of, light, the, relativistic, expression, for, its, energy, like, that, of, the, photon, is, e, v, p, c, displaystyle, e, v, pc, which, is, also, the, value, of, the, space, component, of, its, momentum, to, conserve, momentum, the, muon, has, the, same, value, of, the, space, component, of, the, neutrino, s, momentum, but, in, the, opposite, direction, newton, s, theories, assumed, that, motion, takes, place, against, the, backdrop, of, a, rigid, euclidean, reference, frame, that, extends, throughout, all, space, and, all, time, gravity, is, mediated, by, a, mysterious, force, acting, instantaneously, across, a, distance, whose, actions, are, independent, of, the, intervening, space, in, contrast, einstein, denied, that, there, is, any, background, euclidean, reference, frame, that, extends, throughout, space, nor, is, there, any, such, thing, as, a, force, of, gravitation, only, the, structure, of, spacetime, itself, 175, 190, in, spacetime, terms, the, path, of, a, satellite, orbiting, the, earth, is, not, dictated, by, the, distant, influences, of, the, earth, moon, and, sun, instead, the, satellite, moves, through, space, only, in, response, to, local, conditions, since, spacetime, is, everywhere, locally, flat, when, considered, on, a, sufficiently, small, scale, the, satellite, is, always, following, a, straight, line, in, its, local, inertial, frame, we, say, that, the, satellite, always, follows, along, the, path, of, a, geodesic, no, evidence, of, gravitation, can, be, discovered, following, alongside, the, motions, of, a, single, particle, 175, 190, in, any, analysis, of, spacetime, evidence, of, gravitation, requires, that, one, observe, the, relative, accelerations, of, two, bodies, or, two, separated, particles, in, fig, 5, 1, two, separated, particles, free, falling, in, the, gravitational, field, of, the, earth, exhibit, tidal, accelerations, due, to, local, inhomogeneities, in, the, gravitational, field, such, that, each, particle, follows, a, different, path, through, spacetime, the, tidal, accelerations, that, these, particles, exhibit, with, respect, to, each, other, do, not, require, forces, for, their, explanation, rather, einstein, described, them, in, terms, of, the, geometry, of, spacetime, i, e, the, curvature, of, spacetime, these, tidal, accelerations, are, strictly, local, it, is, the, cumulative, total, effect, of, many, local, manifestations, of, curvature, that, result, in, the, appearance, of, a, gravitational, force, acting, at, a, long, range, from, earth, 175, 190, two, central, propositions, underlie, general, relativity, in, poincar, s, conventionalist, views, the, essential, criteria, according, to, which, one, should, select, a, euclidean, versus, non, euclidean, geometry, would, be, economy, and, simplicity, a, realist, would, say, that, einstein, discovered, spacetime, to, be, non, euclidean, a, conventionalist, would, say, that, einstein, merely, found, it, more, convenient, to, use, non, euclidean, geometry, the, conventionalist, would, maintain, that, einstein, s, analysis, said, nothing, about, what, the, geometry, of, spacetime, really, is, such, being, said, in, response, to, the, first, question, a, number, of, authors, including, deser, grishchuk, rosen, weinberg, etc, have, provided, various, formulations, of, gravitation, as, a, field, in, a, flat, manifold, those, theories, are, variously, called, bimetric, gravity, the, field, theoretical, approach, to, general, relativity, and, so, forth, kip, thorne, has, provided, a, popular, review, of, these, theories, 397, 403, the, flat, spacetime, paradigm, posits, that, matter, creates, a, gravitational, field, that, causes, rulers, to, shrink, when, they, are, turned, from, circumferential, orientation, to, radial, and, that, causes, the, ticking, rates, of, clocks, to, dilate, the, flat, spacetime, paradigm, is, fully, equivalent, to, the, curved, spacetime, paradigm, in, that, they, both, represent, the, same, physical, phenomena, however, their, mathematical, formulations, are, entirely, different, working, physicists, routinely, switch, between, using, curved, and, flat, spacetime, techniques, depending, on, the, requirements, of, the, problem, the, flat, spacetime, paradigm, is, convenient, when, performing, approximate, calculations, in, weak, fields, hence, flat, spacetime, techniques, tend, be, used, when, solving, gravitational, wave, problems, while, curved, spacetime, techniques, tend, be, used, in, the, analysis, of, black, holes, 397, 403, the, spacetime, symmetry, group, for, special, relativity, is, the, poincar, group, which, is, a, ten, dimensional, group, of, three, lorentz, boosts, three, rotations, and, four, spacetime, translations, it, is, logical, to, ask, what, symmetries, if, any, might, apply, in, general, relativity, a, tractable, case, might, be, to, consider, the, symmetries, of, spacetime, as, seen, by, observers, located, far, away, from, all, sources, of, the, gravitational, field, the, naive, expectation, for, asymptotically, flat, spacetime, symmetries, might, be, simply, to, extend, and, reproduce, the, symmetries, of, flat, spacetime, of, special, relativity, viz, the, poincar, group, in, 1962, hermann, bondi, m, g, van, der, burg, a, w, metzner, and, rainer, k, sachs, addressed, this, asymptotic, symmetry, problem, in, order, to, investigate, the, flow, of, energy, at, infinity, due, to, propagating, gravitational, waves, their, first, step, was, to, decide, on, some, physically, sensible, boundary, conditions, to, place, on, the, gravitational, field, at, lightlike, infinity, to, characterize, what, it, means, to, say, a, metric, is, asymptotically, flat, making, no, a, priori, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, the, asymptotic, symmetry, group, not, even, the, assumption, that, such, a, group, exists, then, after, designing, what, they, considered, to, be, the, most, sensible, boundary, conditions, they, investigated, the, nature, of, the, resulting, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, that, leave, invariant, the, form, of, the, boundary, conditions, appropriate, for, asymptotically, flat, gravitational, fields, 35, what, they, found, was, that, the, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, actually, do, form, a, group, and, the, structure, of, this, group, does, not, depend, on, the, particular, gravitational, field, that, happens, to, be, present, this, means, that, as, expected, one, can, separate, the, kinematics, of, spacetime, from, the, dynamics, of, the, gravitational, field, at, least, at, spatial, infinity, the, puzzling, surprise, in, 1962, was, their, discovery, of, a, rich, infinite, dimensional, group, the, so, called, bms, group, as, the, asymptotic, symmetry, group, instead, of, the, finite, dimensional, poincar, group, which, is, a, subgroup, of, the, bms, group, not, only, are, the, lorentz, transformations, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, there, are, also, additional, transformations, that, are, not, lorentz, transformations, but, are, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, in, fact, they, found, an, additional, infinity, of, transformation, generators, known, as, supertranslations, this, implies, the, conclusion, that, general, relativity, gr, does, not, reduce, to, special, relativity, in, the, case, of, weak, fields, at, long, distances, 35, riemannian, geometry, is, the, branch, of, differential, geometry, that, studies, riemannian, manifolds, defined, as, smooth, manifolds, with, a, riemannian, metric, an, inner, product, on, the, tangent, space, at, each, point, that, varies, smoothly, from, point, to, point, this, gives, in, particular, local, notions, of, angle, length, of, curves, surface, area, and, volume, from, those, some, other, global, quantities, can, be, derived, by, integrating, local, contributions, for, physical, reasons, a, spacetime, continuum, is, mathematically, defined, as, a, four, dimensional, smooth, connected, lorentzian, manifold, m, g, displaystyle, m, g, this, means, the, smooth, lorentz, metric, g, displaystyle, g, has, signature, 3, 1, displaystyle, 3, 1, the, metric, determines, the, geometry, of, spacetime, as, well, as, determining, the, geodesics, of, particles, and, light, beams, about, each, point, event, on, this, manifold, coordinate, charts, are, used, to, represent, observers, in, reference, frames, usually, cartesian, coordinates, x, y, z, t, displaystyle, x, y, z, t, are, used, moreover, for, simplicity, s, sake, units, of, measurement, are, usually, chosen, such, that, the, speed, of, light, c, displaystyle, c, is, equal, to, 1, a, reference, frame, observer, can, be, identified, with, one, of, these, coordinate, charts, any, such, observer, can, describe, any, event, p, displaystyle, p, another, reference, frame, may, be, identified, by, a, second, coordinate, chart, about, p, displaystyle, p, two, observers, one, in, each, reference, frame, may, describe, the, same, event, p, displaystyle, p, but, obtain, different, descriptions, usually, many, overlapping, coordinate, charts, are, needed, to, cover, a, manifold, given, two, coordinate, charts, one, containing, p, displaystyle, p, representing, an, observer, and, another, containing, q, displaystyle, q, representing, another, observer, the, intersection, of, the, charts, represents, the, region, of, spacetime, in, which, both, observers, can, measure, physical, quantities, and, hence, compare, results, the, relation, between, the, two, sets, of, measurements, is, given, by, a, non, singular, coordinate, transformation, on, this, intersection, the, idea, of, coordinate, charts, as, local, observers, who, can, perform, measurements, in, their, vicinity, also, makes, good, physical, sense, as, this, is, how, one, actually, collects, physical, data, locally, for, example, two, observers, one, of, whom, is, on, earth, but, the, other, one, who, is, on, a, fast, rocket, to, jupiter, may, observe, a, comet, crashing, into, jupiter, this, is, the, event, p, displaystyle, p, in, general, they, will, disagree, about, the, exact, location, and, timing, of, this, impact, i, e, they, will, have, different, 4, tuples, x, y, z, t, displaystyle, x, y, z, t, as, they, are, using, different, coordinate, systems, although, their, kinematic, descriptions, will, differ, dynamical, physical, laws, such, as, momentum, conservation, and, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, will, still, hold, in, fact, relativity, theory, requires, more, than, this, in, the, sense, that, it, stipulates, these, and, all, other, physical, laws, must, take, the, same, form, in, all, coordinate, systems, this, introduces, tensors, into, relativity, by, which, all, physical, quantities, are, represented, geodesics, are, said, to, be, timelike, null, or, spacelike, if, the, tangent, vector, to, one, point, of, the, geodesic, is, of, this, nature, paths, of, particles, and, light, beams, in, spacetime, are, represented, by, timelike, and, null, lightlike, geodesics, respectively, there, are, two, kinds, of, dimensions, spatial, bidirectional, and, temporal, unidirectional, let, the, number, of, spatial, dimensions, be, n, and, the, number, of, temporal, dimensions, be, t, that, n, 3, and, t, 1, setting, aside, the, compactified, dimensions, invoked, by, string, theory, and, undetectable, to, date, can, be, explained, by, appealing, to, the, physical, consequences, of, letting, n, differ, from, 3, and, t, differ, from, 1, the, argument, is, often, of, an, anthropic, character, and, possibly, the, first, of, its, kind, albeit, before, the, complete, concept, came, into, vogue, the, implicit, notion, that, the, dimensionality, of, the, universe, is, special, is, first, attributed, to, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, who, in, the, discourse, on, metaphysics, suggested, that, the, world, is, the, one, which, is, at, the, same, time, the, simplest, in, hypothesis, and, the, richest, in, phenomena, immanuel, kant, argued, that, 3, dimensional, space, was, a, consequence, of, the, inverse, square, law, of, universal, gravitation, while, kant, s, argument, is, historically, important, john, d, barrow, said, that, it, gets, the, punch, line, back, to, front, it, is, the, three, dimensionality, of, space, that, explains, why, we, see, inverse, square, force, laws, in, nature, not, vice, versa, barrow, 2002, 204, in, 1920, paul, ehrenfest, showed, that, if, there, is, only, a, single, time, dimension, and, more, than, three, spatial, dimensions, the, orbit, of, a, planet, about, its, sun, cannot, remain, stable, the, same, is, true, of, a, star, s, orbit, around, the, center, of, its, galaxy, ehrenfest, also, showed, that, if, there, are, an, even, number, of, spatial, dimensions, then, the, different, parts, of, a, wave, impulse, will, travel, at, different, speeds, if, there, are, 5, 2, k, displaystyle, 5, 2k, spatial, dimensions, where, k, is, a, positive, whole, number, then, wave, impulses, become, distorted, in, 1922, hermann, weyl, claimed, that, maxwell, s, theory, of, electromagnetism, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, an, action, only, for, a, four, dimensional, manifold, finally, tangherlini, showed, in, 1963, that, when, there, are, more, than, three, spatial, dimensions, electron, orbitals, around, nuclei, cannot, be, stable, electrons, would, either, fall, into, the, nucleus, or, disperse, max, tegmark, expands, on, the, preceding, argument, in, the, following, anthropic, manner, if, t, differs, from, 1, the, behavior, of, physical, systems, could, not, be, predicted, reliably, from, knowledge, of, the, relevant, partial, differential, equations, in, such, a, universe, intelligent, life, capable, of, manipulating, technology, could, not, emerge, moreover, if, t, 1, tegmark, maintains, that, protons, and, electrons, would, be, unstable, and, could, decay, into, particles, having, greater, mass, than, themselves, this, is, not, a, problem, if, the, particles, have, a, sufficiently, low, temperature, lastly, if, n, 3, gravitation, of, any, kind, becomes, problematic, and, the, universe, would, probably, be, too, simple, to, contain, observers, for, example, when, n, 3, nerves, cannot, cross, without, intersecting, hence, anthropic, and, other, arguments, rule, out, all, cases, except, n, 3, and, t, 1, which, describes, the, world, around, us, on, the, other, hand, in, view, of, creating, black, holes, from, an, ideal, monatomic, gas, under, its, self, gravity, wei, xiang, feng, showed, that, 3, 1, dimensional, spacetime, is, the, marginal, dimensionality, moreover, it, is, the, unique, dimensionality, that, can, afford, a, stable, gas, sphere, with, a, positive, cosmological, constant, however, a, self, gravitating, gas, cannot, be, stably, bound, if, the, mass, sphere, is, larger, than, 10, 21, solar, masses, due, to, the, small, positivity, of, the, cosmological, constant, observed
