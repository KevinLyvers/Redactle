in, nuclear, physics, and, particle, physics, the, weak, interaction, also, called, the, weak, force, is, one, of, the, four, known, fundamental, interactions, with, the, others, being, electromagnetism, the, strong, interaction, and, gravitation, it, is, the, mechanism, of, interaction, between, subatomic, particles, that, is, responsible, for, the, radioactive, decay, of, atoms, the, weak, interaction, participates, in, nuclear, fission, and, nuclear, fusion, the, theory, describing, its, behaviour, and, effects, is, sometimes, called, quantum, flavordynamics, qfd, however, the, term, qfd, is, rarely, used, because, the, weak, force, is, better, understood, by, electroweak, theory, ewt, the, effective, range, of, the, weak, force, is, limited, to, subatomic, distances, and, is, less, than, the, diameter, of, a, proton, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, provides, a, uniform, framework, for, understanding, electromagnetic, weak, and, strong, interactions, an, interaction, occurs, when, two, particles, typically, but, not, necessarily, half, integer, spin, fermions, exchange, integer, spin, force, carrying, bosons, the, fermions, involved, in, such, exchanges, can, be, either, elementary, e, g, electrons, or, quarks, or, composite, e, g, protons, or, neutrons, although, at, the, deepest, levels, all, weak, interactions, ultimately, are, between, elementary, particles, in, the, weak, interaction, fermions, can, exchange, three, types, of, force, carriers, namely, w, w, and, z, bosons, the, masses, of, these, bosons, are, far, greater, than, the, mass, of, a, proton, or, neutron, which, is, consistent, with, the, short, range, of, the, weak, force, in, fact, the, force, is, termed, weak, because, its, field, strength, over, any, set, distance, is, typically, several, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, that, of, the, electromagnetic, force, which, itself, is, further, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, the, strong, nuclear, force, the, weak, interaction, is, the, only, fundamental, interaction, that, breaks, parity, symmetry, and, similarly, but, far, more, rarely, the, only, interaction, to, break, charge, parity, symmetry, quarks, which, make, up, composite, particles, like, neutrons, and, protons, come, in, six, flavours, up, down, charm, strange, top, and, bottom, which, give, those, composite, particles, their, properties, the, weak, interaction, is, unique, in, that, it, allows, quarks, to, swap, their, flavour, for, another, the, swapping, of, those, properties, is, mediated, by, the, force, carrier, bosons, for, example, during, beta, minus, decay, a, down, quark, within, a, neutron, is, changed, into, an, up, quark, thus, converting, the, neutron, to, a, proton, and, resulting, in, the, emission, of, an, electron, and, an, electron, antineutrino, weak, interaction, is, important, in, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, in, a, star, this, is, because, it, can, convert, a, proton, hydrogen, into, a, neutron, to, form, deuterium, which, is, important, for, the, continuation, of, nuclear, fusion, to, form, helium, the, accumulation, of, neutrons, facilitates, the, buildup, of, heavy, nuclei, in, a, star, most, fermions, decay, by, a, weak, interaction, over, time, such, decay, makes, radiocarbon, dating, possible, as, carbon, 14, decays, through, the, weak, interaction, to, nitrogen, 14, it, can, also, create, radioluminescence, commonly, used, in, tritium, luminescence, and, in, the, related, field, of, betavoltaics, but, not, similar, radium, luminescence, the, electroweak, force, is, believed, to, have, separated, into, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, forces, during, the, quark, epoch, of, the, early, universe, in, 1933, enrico, fermi, proposed, the, first, theory, of, the, weak, interaction, known, as, fermi, s, interaction, he, suggested, that, beta, decay, could, be, explained, by, a, four, fermion, interaction, involving, a, contact, force, with, no, range, in, the, mid, 1950s, chen, ning, yang, and, tsung, dao, lee, first, suggested, that, the, handedness, of, the, spins, of, particles, in, weak, interaction, might, violate, the, conservation, law, or, symmetry, in, 1957, chien, shiung, wu, and, collaborators, confirmed, the, symmetry, violation, in, the, 1960s, sheldon, glashow, abdus, salam, and, steven, weinberg, unified, the, electromagnetic, force, and, the, weak, interaction, by, showing, them, to, be, two, aspects, of, a, single, force, now, termed, the, electroweak, force, the, existence, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, was, not, directly, confirmed, until, 1983, p8, the, electrically, charged, weak, interaction, is, unique, in, a, number, of, respects, due, to, their, large, mass, approximately, 90, gev, c, 2, these, carrier, particles, called, the, w, and, z, bosons, are, short, lived, with, a, lifetime, of, under, 10, 24, seconds, the, weak, interaction, has, a, coupling, constant, an, indicator, of, how, frequently, interactions, occur, between, 10, 7, and, 10, 6, compared, to, the, electromagnetic, coupling, constant, of, about, 10, 2, and, the, strong, interaction, coupling, constant, of, about, 1, consequently, the, weak, interaction, is, weak, in, terms, of, intensity, the, weak, interaction, has, a, very, short, effective, range, around, 10, 17, to, 10, 16, m, 0, 01, to, 0, 1, fm, at, distances, around, 10, 18, meters, 0, 001, fm, the, weak, interaction, has, an, intensity, of, a, similar, magnitude, to, the, electromagnetic, force, but, this, starts, to, decrease, exponentially, with, increasing, distance, scaled, up, by, just, one, and, a, half, orders, of, magnitude, at, distances, of, around, 3, 10, 17, m, the, weak, interaction, becomes, 10, 000, times, weaker, the, weak, interaction, affects, all, the, fermions, of, the, standard, model, as, well, as, the, higgs, boson, neutrinos, interact, only, through, gravity, and, the, weak, interaction, the, weak, interaction, does, not, produce, bound, states, nor, does, it, involve, binding, energy, something, that, gravity, does, on, an, astronomical, scale, the, electromagnetic, force, does, at, the, molecular, and, atomic, levels, and, the, strong, nuclear, force, does, only, at, the, subatomic, level, inside, of, nuclei, its, most, noticeable, effect, is, due, to, its, first, unique, feature, the, charged, weak, interaction, causes, flavour, change, for, example, a, neutron, is, heavier, than, a, proton, its, partner, nucleon, and, can, decay, into, a, proton, by, changing, the, flavour, type, of, one, of, its, two, down, quarks, to, an, up, quark, neither, the, strong, interaction, nor, electromagnetism, permit, flavour, changing, so, this, can, only, proceed, by, weak, decay, without, weak, decay, quark, properties, such, as, strangeness, and, charm, associated, with, the, strange, quark, and, charm, quark, respectively, would, also, be, conserved, across, all, interactions, all, mesons, are, unstable, because, of, weak, decay, p29, in, the, process, known, as, beta, decay, a, down, quark, in, the, neutron, can, change, into, an, up, quark, by, emitting, a, virtual, w, boson, which, then, decays, into, an, electron, and, an, electron, antineutrino, p28, another, example, is, electron, capture, a, common, variant, of, radioactive, decay, wherein, a, proton, and, an, electron, within, an, atom, interact, and, are, changed, to, a, neutron, an, up, quark, is, changed, to, a, down, quark, and, an, electron, neutrino, is, emitted, due, to, the, large, masses, of, the, w, bosons, particle, transformations, or, decays, e, g, flavour, change, that, depend, on, the, weak, interaction, typically, occur, much, more, slowly, than, transformations, or, decays, that, depend, only, on, the, strong, or, electromagnetic, forces, for, example, a, neutral, pion, decays, electromagnetically, and, so, has, a, life, of, only, about, 10, 16, seconds, in, contrast, a, charged, pion, can, only, decay, through, the, weak, interaction, and, so, lives, about, 10, 8, seconds, or, a, hundred, million, times, longer, than, a, neutral, pion, p30, a, particularly, extreme, example, is, the, weak, force, decay, of, a, free, neutron, which, takes, about, 15, minutes, p28, all, particles, have, a, property, called, weak, isospin, symbol, t, 3, which, serves, as, an, additive, quantum, number, that, restricts, how, the, particle, can, interact, with, the, w, of, the, weak, force, weak, isospin, plays, the, same, role, in, the, weak, interaction, with, w, as, electric, charge, does, in, electromagnetism, and, color, charge, in, the, strong, interaction, a, different, number, with, a, similar, name, weak, charge, discussed, below, is, used, for, interactions, with, the, z, 0, all, left, handed, fermions, have, a, weak, isospin, value, of, either, 1, 2, or, 1, 2, all, right, handed, fermions, have, 0, isospin, for, example, the, up, quark, has, t, 3, 1, 2, and, the, down, quark, has, t, 3, 1, 2, a, quark, never, decays, through, the, weak, interaction, into, a, quark, of, the, same, t, 3, quarks, with, a, t, 3, of, 1, 2, only, decay, into, quarks, with, a, t, 3, of, 1, 2, and, conversely, in, any, given, strong, electromagnetic, or, weak, interaction, weak, isospin, is, conserved, the, sum, of, the, weak, isospin, numbers, of, the, particles, entering, the, interaction, equals, the, sum, of, the, weak, isospin, numbers, of, the, particles, exiting, that, interaction, for, example, a, left, handed, with, a, weak, isospin, of, 1, normally, decays, into, a, with, t, 3, 1, 2, and, a, as, a, right, handed, antiparticle, 1, 2, p30, for, the, development, of, the, electroweak, theory, another, property, weak, hypercharge, was, invented, defined, as, where, y, w, is, the, weak, hypercharge, of, a, particle, with, electrical, charge, q, in, elementary, charge, units, and, weak, isospin, t, 3, weak, hypercharge, is, the, generator, of, the, u, 1, component, of, the, electroweak, gauge, group, whereas, some, particles, have, a, weak, isospin, of, zero, all, known, spin, 1, 2, particles, have, a, non, zero, weak, hypercharge, there, are, two, types, of, weak, interaction, called, vertices, the, first, type, is, called, the, charged, current, interaction, because, the, weakly, interacting, fermions, form, a, current, with, total, electric, charge, that, is, nonzero, the, second, type, is, called, the, neutral, current, interaction, because, the, weakly, interacting, fermions, form, a, current, with, total, electric, charge, of, zero, it, is, responsible, for, the, rare, deflection, of, neutrinos, the, two, types, of, interaction, follow, different, selection, rules, this, naming, convention, is, often, misunderstood, to, label, the, electric, charge, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, however, the, naming, convention, predates, the, concept, of, the, mediator, bosons, and, clearly, at, least, in, name, labels, the, charge, of, the, current, formed, from, the, fermions, not, necessarily, the, bosons, in, one, type, of, charged, current, interaction, a, charged, lepton, such, as, an, electron, or, a, muon, having, a, charge, of, 1, can, absorb, a, w, boson, a, particle, with, a, charge, of, 1, and, be, thereby, converted, into, a, corresponding, neutrino, with, a, charge, of, 0, where, the, type, flavour, of, neutrino, electron, e, muon, or, tau, is, the, same, as, the, type, of, lepton, in, the, interaction, for, example, similarly, a, down, type, quark, d, s, or, b, with, a, charge, of, 1, 3, can, be, converted, into, an, up, type, quark, u, c, or, t, with, a, charge, of, 2, 3, by, emitting, a, w, boson, or, by, absorbing, a, w, boson, more, precisely, the, down, type, quark, becomes, a, quantum, superposition, of, up, type, quarks, that, is, to, say, it, has, a, possibility, of, becoming, any, one, of, the, three, up, type, quarks, with, the, probabilities, given, in, the, ckm, matrix, tables, conversely, an, up, type, quark, can, emit, a, w, boson, or, absorb, a, w, boson, and, thereby, be, converted, into, a, down, type, quark, for, example, the, w, boson, is, unstable, so, will, rapidly, decay, with, a, very, short, lifetime, for, example, decay, of, a, w, boson, to, other, products, can, happen, with, varying, probabilities, in, the, so, called, beta, decay, of, a, neutron, see, picture, above, a, down, quark, within, the, neutron, emits, a, virtual, w, boson, and, is, thereby, converted, into, an, up, quark, converting, the, neutron, into, a, proton, because, of, the, limited, energy, involved, in, the, process, i, e, the, mass, difference, between, the, down, quark, and, the, up, quark, the, virtual, w, boson, can, only, carry, sufficient, energy, to, produce, an, electron, and, an, electron, antineutrino, the, two, lowest, possible, masses, among, its, prospective, decay, products, at, the, quark, level, the, process, can, be, represented, as, in, neutral, current, interactions, a, quark, or, a, lepton, e, g, an, electron, or, a, muon, emits, or, absorbs, a, neutral, z, boson, for, example, like, the, w, bosons, the, z, 0, boson, also, decays, rapidly, for, example, unlike, the, charged, current, interaction, whose, selection, rules, are, strictly, limited, by, chirality, electric, charge, and, or, weak, isospin, the, neutral, current, z, 0, interaction, can, cause, any, two, fermions, in, the, standard, model, to, deflect, either, particles, or, anti, particles, with, any, electric, charge, and, both, left, and, right, chirality, although, the, strength, of, the, interaction, differs, the, quantum, number, weak, charge, q, w, serves, the, same, role, in, the, neutral, current, interaction, with, the, z, 0, that, electric, charge, q, with, no, subscript, does, in, the, electromagnetic, interaction, it, quantifies, the, vector, part, of, the, interaction, its, value, is, given, by, since, the, weak, mixing, angle, w, 29, displaystyle, theta, mathsf, w, approx, 29, circ, the, parenthetic, expression, 1, 4, sin, 2, w, 0, 060, displaystyle, 1, 4, sin, 2, theta, mathsf, w, approx, 0, 060, with, its, value, varying, slightly, with, the, momentum, difference, called, running, between, the, particles, involved, hence, since, by, convention, sgn, t, 3, sgn, q, displaystyle, operatorname, sgn, t, 3, equiv, operatorname, sgn, q, and, for, all, fermions, involved, in, the, weak, interaction, t, 3, 1, 2, displaystyle, t, 3, pm, tfrac, 1, 2, the, weak, charge, of, charged, leptons, is, then, close, to, zero, so, these, mostly, interact, with, the, z, boson, through, the, axial, coupling, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, describes, the, electromagnetic, interaction, and, the, weak, interaction, as, two, different, aspects, of, a, single, electroweak, interaction, this, theory, was, developed, around, 1968, by, sheldon, glashow, abdus, salam, and, steven, weinberg, and, they, were, awarded, the, 1979, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, work, the, higgs, mechanism, provides, an, explanation, for, the, presence, of, three, massive, gauge, bosons, w, w, z, 0, the, three, carriers, of, the, weak, interaction, and, the, photon, the, massless, gauge, boson, that, carries, the, electromagnetic, interaction, according, to, the, electroweak, theory, at, very, high, energies, the, universe, has, four, components, of, the, higgs, field, whose, interactions, are, carried, by, four, massless, gauge, bosons, each, similar, to, the, photon, forming, a, complex, scalar, higgs, field, doublet, likewise, there, are, four, massless, electroweak, bosons, however, at, low, energies, this, gauge, symmetry, is, spontaneously, broken, down, to, the, u, 1, symmetry, of, electromagnetism, since, one, of, the, higgs, fields, acquires, a, vacuum, expectation, value, na, vely, the, symmetry, breaking, would, be, expected, to, produce, three, massless, bosons, but, instead, those, extra, three, higgs, bosons, become, incorporated, into, the, three, weak, bosons, which, then, acquire, mass, through, the, higgs, mechanism, these, three, composite, bosons, are, the, w, w, and, z, 0, bosons, actually, observed, in, the, weak, interaction, the, fourth, electroweak, gauge, boson, is, the, photon, of, electromagnetism, which, does, not, couple, to, any, of, the, higgs, fields, and, so, remains, massless, this, theory, has, made, a, number, of, predictions, including, a, prediction, of, the, masses, of, the, z, and, w, bosons, before, their, discovery, and, detection, in, 1983, on, 4, july, 2012, the, cms, and, the, atlas, experimental, teams, at, the, large, hadron, collider, independently, announced, that, they, had, confirmed, the, formal, discovery, of, a, previously, unknown, boson, of, mass, between, 125, and, 127, gev, c, 2, whose, behaviour, so, far, was, consistent, with, a, higgs, boson, while, adding, a, cautious, note, that, further, data, and, analysis, were, needed, before, positively, identifying, the, new, boson, as, being, a, higgs, boson, of, some, type, by, 14, march, 2013, a, higgs, boson, was, tentatively, confirmed, to, exist, in, a, speculative, case, where, the, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, scale, were, lowered, the, unbroken, su, 2, interaction, would, eventually, become, confining, alternative, models, where, su, 2, becomes, confining, above, that, scale, appear, quantitatively, similar, to, the, standard, model, at, lower, energies, but, dramatically, different, above, symmetry, breaking, the, laws, of, nature, were, long, thought, to, remain, the, same, under, mirror, reflection, the, results, of, an, experiment, viewed, via, a, mirror, were, expected, to, be, identical, to, the, results, of, a, separately, constructed, mirror, reflected, copy, of, the, experimental, apparatus, watched, through, the, mirror, this, so, called, law, of, parity, conservation, was, known, to, be, respected, by, classical, gravitation, electromagnetism, and, the, strong, interaction, it, was, assumed, to, be, a, universal, law, however, in, the, mid, 1950s, chen, ning, yang, and, tsung, dao, lee, suggested, that, the, weak, interaction, might, violate, this, law, chien, shiung, wu, and, collaborators, in, 1957, discovered, that, the, weak, interaction, violates, parity, earning, yang, and, lee, the, 1957, nobel, prize, in, physics, although, the, weak, interaction, was, once, described, by, fermi, s, theory, the, discovery, of, parity, violation, and, renormalization, theory, suggested, that, a, new, approach, was, needed, in, 1957, robert, marshak, and, george, sudarshan, and, somewhat, later, richard, feynman, and, murray, gell, mann, proposed, a, v, a, vector, minus, axial, vector, or, left, handed, lagrangian, for, weak, interactions, in, this, theory, the, weak, interaction, acts, only, on, left, handed, particles, and, right, handed, antiparticles, since, the, mirror, reflection, of, a, left, handed, particle, is, right, handed, this, explains, the, maximal, violation, of, parity, the, v, a, theory, was, developed, before, the, discovery, of, the, z, boson, so, it, did, not, include, the, right, handed, fields, that, enter, in, the, neutral, current, interaction, however, this, theory, allowed, a, compound, symmetry, cp, to, be, conserved, cp, combines, parity, p, switching, left, to, right, with, charge, conjugation, c, switching, particles, with, antiparticles, physicists, were, again, surprised, when, in, 1964, james, cronin, and, val, fitch, provided, clear, evidence, in, kaon, decays, that, cp, symmetry, could, be, broken, too, winning, them, the, 1980, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1973, makoto, kobayashi, and, toshihide, maskawa, showed, that, cp, violation, in, the, weak, interaction, required, more, than, two, generations, of, particles, effectively, predicting, the, existence, of, a, then, unknown, third, generation, this, discovery, earned, them, half, of, the, 2008, nobel, prize, in, physics, unlike, parity, violation, cp, violation, occurs, only, in, rare, circumstances, despite, its, limited, occurrence, under, present, conditions, it, is, widely, believed, to, be, the, reason, that, there, is, much, more, matter, than, antimatter, in, the, universe, and, thus, forms, one, of, andrei, sakharov, s, three, conditions, for, baryogenesis
