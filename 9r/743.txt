humidity, is, the, concentration, of, water, vapor, present, in, the, air, water, vapor, the, gaseous, state, of, water, is, generally, invisible, to, the, human, eye, humidity, indicates, the, likelihood, for, precipitation, dew, or, fog, to, be, present, humidity, depends, on, the, temperature, and, pressure, of, the, system, of, interest, the, same, amount, of, water, vapor, results, in, higher, relative, humidity, in, cool, air, than, warm, air, a, related, parameter, is, the, dew, point, the, amount, of, water, vapor, needed, to, achieve, saturation, increases, as, the, temperature, increases, as, the, temperature, of, a, parcel, of, air, decreases, it, will, eventually, reach, the, saturation, point, without, adding, or, losing, water, mass, the, amount, of, water, vapor, contained, within, a, parcel, of, air, can, vary, significantly, for, example, a, parcel, of, air, near, saturation, may, contain, 28, g, of, water, per, cubic, metre, of, air, at, 30, c, 86, f, but, only, 8, g, of, water, per, cubic, metre, of, air, at, 8, c, 46, f, three, primary, measurements, of, humidity, are, widely, employed, absolute, relative, and, specific, absolute, humidity, is, expressed, as, either, mass, of, water, vapor, per, volume, of, moist, air, in, grams, per, cubic, meter, or, as, mass, of, water, vapor, per, mass, of, dry, air, usually, in, grams, per, kilogram, relative, humidity, often, expressed, as, a, percentage, indicates, a, present, state, of, absolute, humidity, relative, to, a, maximum, humidity, given, the, same, temperature, specific, humidity, is, the, ratio, of, water, vapor, mass, to, total, moist, air, parcel, mass, humidity, plays, an, important, role, for, surface, life, for, animal, life, dependent, on, perspiration, sweating, to, regulate, internal, body, temperature, high, humidity, impairs, heat, exchange, efficiency, by, reducing, the, rate, of, moisture, evaporation, from, skin, surfaces, this, effect, can, be, calculated, using, a, heat, index, table, or, alternatively, using, a, similar, humidex, the, notion, of, air, holding, water, vapor, or, being, saturated, by, it, is, often, mentioned, in, connection, with, the, concept, of, relative, humidity, this, however, is, misleading, the, amount, of, water, vapor, that, enters, or, can, enter, a, given, space, at, a, given, temperature, is, almost, independent, of, the, amount, of, air, nitrogen, oxygen, etc, that, is, present, indeed, a, vacuum, has, approximately, the, same, equilibrium, capacity, to, hold, water, vapor, as, the, same, volume, filled, with, air, both, are, given, by, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, water, at, the, given, temperature, there, is, a, very, small, difference, described, under, enhancement, factor, below, which, can, be, neglected, in, many, calculations, unless, great, accuracy, is, required, absolute, humidity, is, the, total, mass, of, water, vapor, present, in, a, given, volume, or, mass, of, air, it, does, not, take, temperature, into, consideration, absolute, humidity, in, the, atmosphere, ranges, from, near, zero, to, roughly, 30, g, 1, 1, oz, per, cubic, metre, when, the, air, is, saturated, at, 30, c, 86, f, absolute, humidity, is, the, mass, of, the, water, vapor, m, h, 2, o, displaystyle, m, text, h, 2, text, o, divided, by, the, volume, of, the, air, and, water, vapor, mixture, v, net, displaystyle, v, text, net, which, can, be, expressed, as, a, h, m, h, 2, o, v, net, displaystyle, ah, frac, m, text, h, 2, text, o, v, text, net, if, the, volume, is, not, set, the, absolute, humidity, varies, with, changes, in, air, temperature, or, pressure, because, of, this, it, is, inappropriate, for, computations, in, chemical, engineering, such, as, drying, where, temperature, variations, might, be, significant, as, a, result, absolute, humidity, in, chemical, engineering, may, refer, to, mass, of, water, vapor, per, unit, mass, of, dry, air, also, known, as, the, humidity, ratio, or, mass, mixing, ratio, see, specific, humidity, below, which, is, better, suited, for, heat, and, mass, balance, calculations, mass, of, water, per, unit, volume, as, in, the, equation, above, is, also, defined, as, volumetric, humidity, because, of, the, potential, confusion, british, standard, bs, 1339, suggests, avoiding, the, term, absolute, humidity, units, should, always, be, carefully, checked, many, humidity, charts, are, given, in, g, kg, or, kg, kg, but, any, mass, units, may, be, used, the, field, concerned, with, the, study, of, physical, and, thermodynamic, properties, of, gas, vapor, mixtures, is, named, psychrometrics, relative, humidity, is, the, ratio, of, how, much, water, vapour, is, in, the, air, to, how, much, water, vapour, the, air, could, potentially, contain, at, a, given, temperature, it, varies, with, the, temperature, of, the, air, colder, air, can, contain, less, vapour, and, water, will, tend, to, condense, out, of, the, air, more, at, lower, temperatures, so, changing, the, temperature, of, air, can, change, the, relative, humidity, even, when, the, absolute, humidity, remains, constant, chilling, air, increases, the, relative, humidity, and, can, cause, the, water, vapour, to, condense, if, the, relative, humidity, rises, over, 100, the, dew, point, likewise, warming, air, decreases, the, relative, humidity, warming, some, air, containing, a, fog, may, cause, that, fog, to, evaporate, as, the, droplets, are, prone, to, total, evaporation, due, to, the, heat, relative, humidity, only, considers, the, invisible, water, vapour, mists, clouds, fogs, and, aerosols, of, water, do, not, count, towards, the, measure, of, relative, humidity, of, the, air, although, their, presence, is, an, indication, that, a, body, of, air, may, be, close, to, the, dew, point, relative, humidity, is, normally, expressed, as, a, percentage, a, higher, percentage, means, that, the, air, water, mixture, is, more, humid, at, 100, relative, humidity, the, air, is, saturated, and, is, at, its, dew, point, in, the, absence, of, a, foreign, body, on, which, droplets, or, crystals, can, nucleate, the, relative, humidity, can, exceed, 100, in, which, case, the, air, is, said, to, be, supersaturated, introduction, of, some, particles, or, a, surface, to, a, body, of, air, above, 100, relative, humidity, will, allow, condensation, or, ice, to, form, on, those, nuclei, thereby, removing, some, of, the, vapour, and, lowering, the, humidity, in, a, scientific, notion, the, relative, humidity, r, h, displaystyle, rh, or, displaystyle, varphi, of, an, air, water, mixture, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, partial, pressure, of, water, vapor, p, displaystyle, p, in, air, to, the, saturation, vapor, pressure, p, s, displaystyle, p, s, of, water, at, the, same, temperature, usually, expressed, as, a, percentage, 100, p, p, s, displaystyle, varphi, 100, cdot, p, p, s, relative, humidity, is, an, important, metric, used, in, weather, forecasts, and, reports, as, it, is, an, indicator, of, the, likelihood, of, precipitation, dew, or, fog, in, hot, summer, weather, a, rise, in, relative, humidity, increases, the, apparent, temperature, to, humans, and, other, animals, by, hindering, the, evaporation, of, perspiration, from, the, skin, for, example, according, to, the, heat, index, a, relative, humidity, of, 75, at, air, temperature, of, 80, 0, f, 26, 7, c, would, feel, like, 83, 6, 1, 3, f, 28, 7, 0, 7, c, relative, humidity, is, also, a, key, metric, used, to, evaluate, when, it, is, appropriate, to, install, flooring, over, a, concrete, slab, specific, humidity, or, moisture, content, is, the, ratio, of, the, mass, of, water, vapor, to, the, total, mass, of, the, air, parcel, specific, humidity, is, approximately, equal, to, the, mixing, ratio, which, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, mass, of, water, vapor, in, an, air, parcel, to, the, mass, of, dry, air, for, the, same, parcel, as, temperature, decreases, the, amount, of, water, vapor, needed, to, reach, saturation, also, decreases, as, the, temperature, of, a, parcel, of, air, becomes, lower, it, will, eventually, reach, the, point, of, saturation, without, adding, or, losing, water, mass, the, term, relative, humidity, is, reserved, for, systems, of, water, vapor, in, air, the, term, relative, saturation, is, used, to, describe, the, analogous, property, for, systems, consisting, of, a, condensable, phase, other, than, water, in, a, non, condensable, phase, other, than, air, a, device, used, to, measure, humidity, of, air, is, called, a, psychrometer, or, hygrometer, a, humidistat, is, a, humidity, triggered, switch, often, used, to, control, a, humidifier, or, a, dehumidifier, the, humidity, of, an, air, and, water, vapor, mixture, is, determined, through, the, use, of, psychrometric, charts, if, both, the, dry, bulb, temperature, t, and, the, wet, bulb, temperature, t, w, of, the, mixture, are, known, these, quantities, are, readily, estimated, by, using, a, sling, psychrometer, there, are, several, empirical, formulas, that, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, water, vapor, as, a, function, of, temperature, the, antoine, equation, is, among, the, least, complex, of, these, having, only, three, parameters, a, b, and, c, other, formulas, such, as, the, goff, gratch, equation, and, the, magnus, tetens, approximation, are, more, complicated, but, yield, better, accuracy, the, arden, buck, equation, is, commonly, encountered, in, the, literature, regarding, this, topic, e, w, 1, 0007, 3, 46, 10, 6, p, 6, 1121, e, 17, 502, t, 240, 97, t, displaystyle, e, w, left, 1, 0007, 3, 46, times, 10, 6, p, right, times, 6, 1121, e, 17, 502t, 240, 97, t, where, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, dry, bulb, temperature, expressed, in, degrees, celsius, c, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, absolute, pressure, expressed, in, millibars, and, e, w, displaystyle, e, w, is, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, expressed, in, millibars, buck, has, reported, that, the, maximal, relative, error, is, less, than, 0, 20, between, 20, and, 50, c, 4, and, 122, f, when, this, particular, form, of, the, generalized, formula, is, used, to, estimate, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, water, there, are, various, devices, used, to, measure, and, regulate, humidity, calibration, standards, for, the, most, accurate, measurement, include, the, gravimetric, hygrometer, chilled, mirror, hygrometer, and, electrolytic, hygrometer, the, gravimetric, method, while, the, most, accurate, is, very, cumbersome, for, fast, and, very, accurate, measurement, the, chilled, mirror, method, is, effective, for, process, on, line, measurements, the, most, commonly, used, sensors, nowadays, are, based, on, capacitance, measurements, to, measure, relative, humidity, frequently, with, internal, conversions, to, display, absolute, humidity, as, well, these, are, cheap, simple, generally, accurate, and, relatively, robust, all, humidity, sensors, face, problems, in, measuring, dust, laden, gas, such, as, exhaust, streams, from, clothes, dryers, humidity, is, also, measured, on, a, global, scale, using, remotely, placed, satellites, these, satellites, are, able, to, detect, the, concentration, of, water, in, the, troposphere, at, altitudes, between, 4, and, 12, km, 2, 5, and, 7, 5, mi, satellites, that, can, measure, water, vapor, have, sensors, that, are, sensitive, to, infrared, radiation, water, vapor, specifically, absorbs, and, re, radiates, radiation, in, this, spectral, band, satellite, water, vapor, imagery, plays, an, important, role, in, monitoring, climate, conditions, like, the, formation, of, thunderstorms, and, in, the, development, of, weather, forecasts, humidity, depends, on, water, vaporization, and, condensation, which, in, turn, mainly, depends, on, temperature, therefore, when, applying, more, pressure, to, a, gas, saturated, with, water, all, components, will, initially, decrease, in, volume, approximately, according, to, the, ideal, gas, law, however, some, of, the, water, will, condense, until, returning, to, almost, the, same, humidity, as, before, giving, the, resulting, total, volume, deviating, from, what, the, ideal, gas, law, predicted, conversely, decreasing, temperature, would, also, make, some, water, condense, again, making, the, final, volume, deviate, from, predicted, by, the, ideal, gas, law, therefore, gas, volume, may, alternatively, be, expressed, as, the, dry, volume, excluding, the, humidity, content, this, fraction, more, accurately, follows, the, ideal, gas, law, on, the, contrary, the, saturated, volume, is, the, volume, a, gas, mixture, would, have, if, humidity, was, added, to, it, until, saturation, or, 100, relative, humidity, humid, air, is, less, dense, than, dry, air, because, a, molecule, of, water, m, 18, u, is, less, massive, than, either, a, molecule, of, nitrogen, m, 28, or, a, molecule, of, oxygen, m, 32, about, 78, of, the, molecules, in, dry, air, are, nitrogen, n, 2, another, 21, of, the, molecules, in, dry, air, are, oxygen, o, 2, the, final, 1, of, dry, air, is, a, mixture, of, other, gases, for, any, gas, at, a, given, temperature, and, pressure, the, number, of, molecules, present, in, a, particular, volume, is, constant, therefore, when, some, number, n, of, water, molecules, vapor, is, introduced, into, a, volume, of, dry, air, the, number, of, air, molecules, in, that, volume, must, decrease, by, the, same, number, n, for, the, pressure, to, remain, constant, without, using, a, change, in, temperature, the, numbers, are, exactly, equal, if, we, consider, the, gases, as, ideal, the, addition, of, water, molecules, or, any, other, molecules, to, a, gas, without, removal, of, an, equal, number, of, other, molecules, will, necessarily, require, a, change, in, temperature, pressure, or, total, volume, that, is, a, change, in, at, least, one, of, these, three, parameters, if, temperature, and, pressure, remain, constant, the, volume, increases, and, the, dry, air, molecules, that, were, displaced, will, initially, move, out, into, the, additional, volume, after, which, the, mixture, will, eventually, become, uniform, through, diffusion, hence, the, mass, per, unit, volume, of, the, gas, its, density, decreases, isaac, newton, discovered, this, phenomenon, and, wrote, about, it, in, his, book, opticks, the, relative, humidity, of, an, air, water, system, is, dependent, not, only, on, the, temperature, but, also, on, the, absolute, pressure, of, the, system, of, interest, this, dependence, is, demonstrated, by, considering, the, air, water, system, shown, below, the, system, is, closed, i, e, no, matter, enters, or, leaves, the, system, if, the, system, at, state, a, is, isobarically, heated, heating, with, no, change, in, system, pressure, then, the, relative, humidity, of, the, system, decreases, because, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, water, increases, with, increasing, temperature, this, is, shown, in, state, b, if, the, system, at, state, a, is, isothermally, compressed, compressed, with, no, change, in, system, temperature, then, the, relative, humidity, of, the, system, increases, because, the, partial, pressure, of, water, in, the, system, increases, with, the, volume, reduction, this, is, shown, in, state, c, above, 202, 64, kpa, the, rh, would, exceed, 100, and, water, may, begin, to, condense, if, the, pressure, of, state, a, was, changed, by, simply, adding, more, dry, air, without, changing, the, volume, the, relative, humidity, would, not, change, therefore, a, change, in, relative, humidity, can, be, explained, by, a, change, in, system, temperature, a, change, in, the, volume, of, the, system, or, change, in, both, of, these, system, properties, the, enhancement, factor, f, w, displaystyle, f, w, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, saturated, vapor, pressure, of, water, in, moist, air, e, w, displaystyle, e, w, to, the, saturated, vapor, pressure, of, pure, water, f, w, e, w, e, w, displaystyle, f, w, frac, e, w, e, w, the, enhancement, factor, is, equal, to, unity, for, ideal, gas, systems, however, in, real, systems, the, interaction, effects, between, gas, molecules, result, in, a, small, increase, of, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, water, in, air, relative, to, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, pure, water, vapor, therefore, the, enhancement, factor, is, normally, slightly, greater, than, unity, for, real, systems, the, enhancement, factor, is, commonly, used, to, correct, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, water, vapor, when, empirical, relationships, such, as, those, developed, by, wexler, goff, and, gratch, are, used, to, estimate, the, properties, of, psychrometric, systems, buck, has, reported, that, at, sea, level, the, vapor, pressure, of, water, in, saturated, moist, air, amounts, to, an, increase, of, approximately, 0, 5, over, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, pure, water, climate, control, refers, to, the, control, of, temperature, and, relative, humidity, in, buildings, vehicles, and, other, enclosed, spaces, for, the, purpose, of, providing, for, human, comfort, health, and, safety, and, of, meeting, environmental, requirements, of, machines, sensitive, materials, for, example, historic, and, technical, processes, while, humidity, itself, is, a, climate, variable, it, also, affects, other, climate, variables, environmental, humidity, is, affected, by, winds, and, by, rainfall, the, most, humid, cities, on, earth, are, generally, located, closer, to, the, equator, near, coastal, regions, cities, in, parts, of, asia, and, oceania, are, among, the, most, humid, bangkok, ho, chi, minh, city, kuala, lumpur, hong, kong, manila, jakarta, naha, singapore, kaohsiung, and, taipei, have, very, high, humidity, most, or, all, year, round, because, of, their, proximity, to, water, bodies, and, the, equator, and, often, overcast, weather, some, places, experience, extreme, humidity, during, their, rainy, seasons, combined, with, warmth, giving, the, feel, of, a, lukewarm, sauna, such, as, kolkata, chennai, and, kochi, in, india, and, lahore, in, pakistan, sukkur, city, located, on, the, indus, river, in, pakistan, has, some, of, the, highest, and, most, uncomfortable, dew, points, in, the, country, frequently, exceeding, 30, c, 86, f, in, the, monsoon, season, high, temperatures, combine, with, the, high, dew, point, to, create, heat, index, in, excess, of, 65, c, 149, f, darwin, experiences, an, extremely, humid, wet, season, from, december, to, april, houston, miami, san, diego, osaka, shanghai, shenzhen, and, tokyo, also, have, an, extreme, humid, period, in, their, summer, months, during, the, south, west, and, north, east, monsoon, seasons, respectively, late, may, to, september, and, november, to, march, expect, heavy, rains, and, a, relatively, high, humidity, post, rainfall, outside, the, monsoon, seasons, humidity, is, high, in, comparison, to, countries, further, from, the, equator, but, completely, sunny, days, abound, in, cooler, places, such, as, northern, tasmania, australia, high, humidity, is, experienced, all, year, due, to, the, ocean, between, mainland, australia, and, tasmania, in, the, summer, the, hot, dry, air, is, absorbed, by, this, ocean, and, the, temperature, rarely, climbs, above, 35, c, 95, f, humidity, affects, the, energy, budget, and, thereby, influences, temperatures, in, two, major, ways, first, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, contains, latent, energy, during, transpiration, or, evaporation, this, latent, heat, is, removed, from, surface, liquid, cooling, the, earth, s, surface, this, is, the, biggest, non, radiative, cooling, effect, at, the, surface, it, compensates, for, roughly, 70, of, the, average, net, radiative, warming, at, the, surface, second, water, vapor, is, the, most, abundant, of, all, greenhouse, gases, water, vapor, like, a, green, lens, that, allows, green, light, to, pass, through, it, but, absorbs, red, light, is, a, selective, absorber, like, the, other, greenhouse, gasses, water, vapor, is, transparent, to, most, solar, energy, however, it, absorbs, the, infrared, energy, emitted, radiated, upward, by, the, earth, s, surface, which, is, the, reason, that, humid, areas, experience, very, little, nocturnal, cooling, but, dry, desert, regions, cool, considerably, at, night, this, selective, absorption, causes, the, greenhouse, effect, it, raises, the, surface, temperature, substantially, above, its, theoretical, radiative, equilibrium, temperature, with, the, sun, and, water, vapor, is, the, cause, of, more, of, this, warming, than, any, other, greenhouse, gas, unlike, most, other, greenhouse, gases, however, water, is, not, merely, below, its, boiling, point, in, all, regions, of, the, earth, but, below, its, freezing, point, at, many, altitudes, as, a, condensible, greenhouse, gas, it, precipitates, with, a, much, lower, scale, height, and, shorter, atmospheric, lifetime, weeks, instead, of, decades, without, other, greenhouse, gases, earth, s, blackbody, temperature, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, would, cause, water, vapor, to, be, removed, from, the, atmosphere, water, vapor, is, thus, a, slave, to, the, non, condensible, greenhouse, gases, humidity, is, one, of, the, fundamental, abiotic, factors, that, defines, any, habitat, the, tundra, wetlands, and, the, desert, are, a, few, examples, and, is, a, determinant, of, which, animals, and, plants, can, thrive, in, a, given, environment, the, human, body, dissipates, heat, through, perspiration, and, its, evaporation, heat, convection, to, the, surrounding, air, and, thermal, radiation, are, the, primary, modes, of, heat, transport, from, the, body, under, conditions, of, high, humidity, the, rate, of, evaporation, of, sweat, from, the, skin, decreases, also, if, the, atmosphere, is, as, warm, or, warmer, than, the, skin, during, times, of, high, humidity, blood, brought, to, the, body, surface, cannot, dissipate, heat, by, conduction, to, the, air, with, so, much, blood, going, to, the, external, surface, of, the, body, less, goes, to, the, active, muscles, the, brain, and, other, internal, organs, physical, strength, declines, and, fatigue, occurs, sooner, than, it, would, otherwise, alertness, and, mental, capacity, also, may, be, affected, resulting, in, heat, stroke, or, hyperthermia, domesticated, plants, and, animals, e, g, lizards, require, regular, upkeep, of, humidity, percent, when, grown, in, home, and, container, conditions, for, optimal, thriving, environment, although, humidity, is, an, important, factor, for, thermal, comfort, humans, are, more, sensitive, to, variations, in, temperature, than, they, are, to, changes, in, relative, humidity, humidity, has, a, small, effect, on, thermal, comfort, outdoors, when, air, temperatures, are, low, a, slightly, more, pronounced, effect, at, moderate, air, temperatures, and, a, much, stronger, influence, at, higher, air, temperatures, humans, are, sensitive, to, humid, air, because, the, human, body, uses, evaporative, cooling, as, the, primary, mechanism, to, regulate, temperature, under, humid, conditions, the, rate, at, which, perspiration, evaporates, on, the, skin, is, lower, than, it, would, be, under, arid, conditions, because, humans, perceive, the, rate, of, heat, transfer, from, the, body, rather, than, temperature, itself, we, feel, warmer, when, the, relative, humidity, is, high, than, when, it, is, low, humans, can, be, comfortable, within, a, wide, range, of, humidities, depending, on, the, temperature, from, 30, to, 70, but, ideally, not, above, the, absolute, 60, f, dew, point, between, 40, and, 60, in, general, higher, temperatures, will, require, lower, humidities, to, achieve, thermal, comfort, compared, to, lower, temperatures, with, all, other, factors, held, constant, for, example, with, clothing, level, 1, metabolic, rate, 1, 1, and, air, speed, 0, 1, m, s, a, change, in, air, temperature, and, mean, radiant, temperature, from, 20, c, to, 24, c, would, lower, the, maximum, acceptable, relative, humidity, from, 100, to, 65, to, maintain, thermal, comfort, conditions, the, cbe, thermal, comfort, tool, can, be, used, to, demonstrate, the, effect, of, relative, humidity, for, specific, thermal, comfort, conditions, and, it, can, be, used, to, demonstrate, compliance, with, ashrae, standard, 55, 2017, some, people, experience, difficulty, breathing, in, humid, environments, some, cases, may, possibly, be, related, to, respiratory, conditions, such, as, asthma, while, others, may, be, the, product, of, anxiety, affected, people, will, often, hyperventilate, in, response, causing, sensations, of, numbness, faintness, and, loss, of, concentration, among, others, very, low, humidity, can, create, discomfort, respiratory, problems, and, aggravate, allergies, in, some, individuals, low, humidity, causes, tissue, lining, nasal, passages, to, dry, crack, and, become, more, susceptible, to, penetration, of, rhinovirus, cold, viruses, extremely, low, below, 20, relative, humidities, may, also, cause, eye, irritation, the, use, of, a, humidifier, in, homes, especially, bedrooms, can, help, with, these, symptoms, indoor, relative, humidities, should, be, kept, above, 30, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, the, occupant, s, nasal, passages, drying, out, especially, in, winter, air, conditioning, reduces, discomfort, by, reducing, not, just, temperature, but, humidity, as, well, heating, cold, outdoor, air, can, decrease, relative, humidity, levels, indoors, to, below, 30, according, to, ashrae, standard, 55, 2017, thermal, environmental, conditions, for, human, occupancy, indoor, thermal, comfort, can, be, achieved, through, the, pmv, method, with, relative, humidities, ranging, from, 0, to, 100, depending, on, the, levels, of, the, other, factors, contributing, to, thermal, comfort, however, the, recommended, range, of, indoor, relative, humidity, in, air, conditioned, buildings, is, generally, 30, 60, higher, humidity, reduces, the, infectivity, of, aerosolized, influenza, virus, a, study, concluded, maintaining, indoor, relative, humidity, 40, will, significantly, reduce, the, infectivity, of, aerosolized, virus, excess, moisture, in, buildings, expose, occupants, to, fungal, spores, cell, fragments, or, mycotoxins, infants, in, homes, with, mold, have, a, much, greater, risk, of, developing, asthma, and, allergic, rhinitis, more, than, half, of, adult, workers, in, moldy, humid, buildings, develop, nasal, or, sinus, symptoms, due, to, mold, exposure, mucociliary, clearance, in, the, respiratory, tract, is, also, hindered, by, low, humidity, one, study, in, dogs, found, that, mucus, transport, was, lower, at, an, absolute, humidity, of, 9, g, water, m, 3, than, at, 30, g, water, m, 3, increased, humidity, can, also, lead, to, changes, in, total, body, water, that, usually, leads, to, moderate, weight, gain, especially, if, one, is, acclimated, to, working, or, exercising, in, hot, and, humid, weather, common, construction, methods, often, produce, building, enclosures, with, a, poor, thermal, boundary, requiring, an, insulation, and, air, barrier, system, designed, to, retain, indoor, environmental, conditions, while, resisting, external, environmental, conditions, the, energy, efficient, heavily, sealed, architecture, introduced, in, the, 20th, century, also, sealed, off, the, movement, of, moisture, and, this, has, resulted, in, a, secondary, problem, of, condensation, forming, in, and, around, walls, which, encourages, the, development, of, mold, and, mildew, additionally, buildings, with, foundations, not, properly, sealed, will, allow, water, to, flow, through, the, walls, due, to, capillary, action, of, pores, found, in, masonry, products, solutions, for, energy, efficient, buildings, that, avoid, condensation, are, a, current, topic, of, architecture, for, climate, control, in, buildings, using, hvac, systems, the, key, is, to, maintain, the, relative, humidity, at, a, comfortable, range, low, enough, to, be, comfortable, but, high, enough, to, avoid, problems, associated, with, very, dry, air, when, the, temperature, is, high, and, the, relative, humidity, is, low, evaporation, of, water, is, rapid, soil, dries, wet, clothes, hung, on, a, line, or, rack, dry, quickly, and, perspiration, readily, evaporates, from, the, skin, wooden, furniture, can, shrink, causing, the, paint, that, covers, these, surfaces, to, fracture, when, the, temperature, is, low, and, the, relative, humidity, is, high, evaporation, of, water, is, slow, when, relative, humidity, approaches, 100, condensation, can, occur, on, surfaces, leading, to, problems, with, mold, corrosion, decay, and, other, moisture, related, deterioration, condensation, can, pose, a, safety, risk, as, it, can, promote, the, growth, of, mold, and, wood, rot, as, well, as, possibly, freezing, emergency, exits, shut, certain, production, and, technical, processes, and, treatments, in, factories, laboratories, hospitals, and, other, facilities, require, specific, relative, humidity, levels, to, be, maintained, using, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and, associated, control, systems, the, basic, principles, for, buildings, above, also, apply, to, vehicles, in, addition, there, may, be, safety, considerations, for, instance, high, humidity, inside, a, vehicle, can, lead, to, problems, of, condensation, such, as, misting, of, windshields, and, shorting, of, electrical, components, in, vehicles, and, pressure, vessels, such, as, pressurized, airliners, submersibles, and, spacecraft, these, considerations, may, be, critical, to, safety, and, complex, environmental, control, systems, including, equipment, to, maintain, pressure, are, needed, airliners, operate, with, low, internal, relative, humidity, often, under, 20, especially, on, long, flights, the, low, humidity, is, a, consequence, of, drawing, in, the, very, cold, air, with, a, low, absolute, humidity, which, is, found, at, airliner, cruising, altitudes, subsequent, warming, of, this, air, lowers, its, relative, humidity, this, causes, discomfort, such, as, sore, eyes, dry, skin, and, drying, out, of, mucosa, but, humidifiers, are, not, employed, to, raise, it, to, comfortable, mid, range, levels, because, the, volume, of, water, required, to, be, carried, on, board, can, be, a, significant, weight, penalty, as, airliners, descend, from, colder, altitudes, into, warmer, air, perhaps, even, flying, through, clouds, a, few, thousand, feet, above, the, ground, the, ambient, relative, humidity, can, increase, dramatically, some, of, this, moist, air, is, usually, drawn, into, the, pressurized, aircraft, cabin, and, into, other, non, pressurized, areas, of, the, aircraft, and, condenses, on, the, cold, aircraft, skin, liquid, water, can, usually, be, seen, running, along, the, aircraft, skin, both, on, the, inside, and, outside, of, the, cabin, because, of, the, drastic, changes, in, relative, humidity, inside, the, vehicle, components, must, be, qualified, to, operate, in, those, environments, the, recommended, environmental, qualifications, for, most, commercial, aircraft, components, is, listed, in, rtca, do, 160, cold, humid, air, can, promote, the, formation, of, ice, which, is, a, danger, to, aircraft, as, it, affects, the, wing, profile, and, increases, weight, naturally, aspirated, internal, combustion, engines, have, a, further, danger, of, ice, forming, inside, the, carburetor, aviation, weather, reports, metars, therefore, include, an, indication, of, relative, humidity, usually, in, the, form, of, the, dew, point, pilots, must, take, humidity, into, account, when, calculating, takeoff, distances, because, high, humidity, requires, longer, runways, and, will, decrease, climb, performance, density, altitude, is, the, altitude, relative, to, the, standard, atmosphere, conditions, international, standard, atmosphere, at, which, the, air, density, would, be, equal, to, the, indicated, air, density, at, the, place, of, observation, or, in, other, words, the, height, when, measured, in, terms, of, the, density, of, the, air, rather, than, the, distance, from, the, ground, density, altitude, is, the, pressure, altitude, adjusted, for, non, standard, temperature, an, increase, in, temperature, and, to, a, much, lesser, degree, humidity, will, cause, an, increase, in, density, altitude, thus, in, hot, and, humid, conditions, the, density, altitude, at, a, particular, location, may, be, significantly, higher, than, the, true, altitude, electronic, devices, are, often, rated, to, operate, only, under, certain, humidity, conditions, e, g, 10, to, 90, the, optimal, humidity, for, electronic, devices, is, 30, to, 65, at, the, top, end, of, the, range, moisture, may, increase, the, conductivity, of, permeable, insulators, leading, to, malfunction, too, low, humidity, may, make, materials, brittle, a, particular, danger, to, electronic, items, regardless, of, the, stated, operating, humidity, range, is, condensation, when, an, electronic, item, is, moved, from, a, cold, place, e, g, garage, car, shed, air, conditioned, space, in, the, tropics, to, a, warm, humid, place, house, outside, tropics, condensation, may, coat, circuit, boards, and, other, insulators, leading, to, short, circuit, inside, the, equipment, such, short, circuits, may, cause, substantial, permanent, damage, if, the, equipment, is, powered, on, before, the, condensation, has, evaporated, a, similar, condensation, effect, can, often, be, observed, when, a, person, wearing, glasses, comes, in, from, the, cold, i, e, the, glasses, become, foggy, it, is, advisable, to, allow, electronic, equipment, to, acclimatise, for, several, hours, after, being, brought, in, from, the, cold, before, powering, on, some, electronic, devices, can, detect, such, a, change, and, indicate, when, plugged, in, and, usually, with, a, small, droplet, symbol, that, they, cannot, be, used, until, the, risk, from, condensation, has, passed, in, situations, where, time, is, critical, increasing, air, flow, through, the, device, s, internals, such, as, removing, the, side, panel, from, a, pc, case, and, directing, a, fan, to, blow, into, the, case, will, reduce, significantly, the, time, needed, to, acclimatise, to, the, new, environment, in, contrast, a, very, low, humidity, level, favors, the, build, up, of, static, electricity, which, may, result, in, spontaneous, shutdown, of, computers, when, discharges, occur, apart, from, spurious, erratic, function, electrostatic, discharges, can, cause, dielectric, breakdown, in, solid, state, devices, resulting, in, irreversible, damage, data, centers, often, monitor, relative, humidity, levels, for, these, reasons, high, humidity, can, often, have, a, negative, effect, on, the, capacity, of, chemical, plants, and, refineries, that, use, furnaces, as, part, of, a, certain, processes, e, g, steam, reforming, wet, sulfuric, acid, processes, for, example, because, humidity, reduces, ambient, oxygen, concentrations, dry, air, is, typically, 20, 9, oxygen, but, at, 100, relative, humidity, the, air, is, 20, 4, oxygen, flue, gas, fans, must, intake, air, at, a, higher, rate, than, would, otherwise, be, required, to, maintain, the, same, firing, rate, high, humidity, in, the, oven, represented, by, an, elevated, wet, bulb, temperature, increases, the, thermal, conductivity, of, the, air, around, the, baked, item, leading, to, a, quicker, baking, process, or, even, burning, conversely, low, humidity, slows, the, baking, process, down, at, 100, relative, humidity, air, is, saturated, and, at, its, dew, point, the, water, vapor, pressure, would, permit, neither, evaporation, of, nearby, liquid, water, nor, condensation, to, grow, the, nearby, water, neither, sublimation, of, nearby, ice, nor, deposition, to, grow, the, nearby, ice, relative, humidity, can, exceed, 100, in, which, case, the, air, is, supersaturated, cloud, formation, requires, supersaturated, air, cloud, condensation, nuclei, lower, the, level, of, supersaturation, required, to, form, fogs, and, clouds, in, the, absence, of, nuclei, around, which, droplets, or, ice, can, form, a, higher, level, of, supersaturation, is, required, for, these, droplets, or, ice, crystals, to, form, spontaneously, in, the, wilson, cloud, chamber, which, is, used, in, nuclear, physics, experiments, a, state, of, supersaturation, is, created, within, the, chamber, and, moving, subatomic, particles, act, as, condensation, nuclei, so, trails, of, fog, show, the, paths, of, those, particles, for, a, given, dew, point, and, its, corresponding, absolute, humidity, the, relative, humidity, will, change, inversely, albeit, nonlinearly, with, the, temperature, this, is, because, the, vapor, pressure, of, water, increases, with, temperature, the, operative, principle, behind, everything, from, hair, dryers, to, dehumidifiers, due, to, the, increasing, potential, for, a, higher, water, vapor, partial, pressure, at, higher, air, temperatures, the, water, content, of, air, at, sea, level, can, get, as, high, as, 3, by, mass, at, 30, c, 86, f, compared, to, no, more, than, about, 0, 5, by, mass, at, 0, c, 32, f, this, explains, the, low, levels, in, the, absence, of, measures, to, add, moisture, of, humidity, in, heated, structures, during, winter, resulting, in, dry, skin, itchy, eyes, and, persistence, of, static, electric, charges, even, with, saturation, 100, relative, humidity, outdoors, heating, of, infiltrated, outside, air, that, comes, indoors, raises, its, moisture, capacity, which, lowers, relative, humidity, and, increases, evaporation, rates, from, moist, surfaces, indoors, including, human, bodies, and, household, plants, similarly, during, summer, in, humid, climates, a, great, deal, of, liquid, water, condenses, from, air, cooled, in, air, conditioners, warmer, air, is, cooled, below, its, dew, point, and, the, excess, water, vapor, condenses, this, phenomenon, is, the, same, as, that, which, causes, water, droplets, to, form, on, the, outside, of, a, cup, containing, an, ice, cold, drink, a, useful, rule, of, thumb, is, that, the, maximum, absolute, humidity, doubles, for, every, 20, f, 11, c, increase, in, temperature, thus, the, relative, humidity, will, drop, by, a, factor, of, 2, for, each, 20, f, 11, c, increase, in, temperature, assuming, conservation, of, absolute, moisture, for, example, in, the, range, of, normal, temperatures, air, at, 68, f, 20, c, and, 50, relative, humidity, will, become, saturated, if, cooled, to, 50, f, 10, c, its, dew, point, and, 41, f, 5, c, air, at, 80, relative, humidity, warmed, to, 68, f, 20, c, will, have, a, relative, humidity, of, only, 29, and, feel, dry, by, comparison, thermal, comfort, standard, ashrae, 55, requires, systems, designed, to, control, humidity, to, maintain, a, dew, point, of, 16, 8, c, 62, 2, f, though, no, lower, humidity, limit, is, established, water, vapor, is, a, lighter, gas, than, other, gaseous, components, of, air, at, the, same, temperature, so, humid, air, will, tend, to, rise, by, natural, convection, this, is, a, mechanism, behind, thunderstorms, and, other, weather, phenomena, relative, humidity, is, often, mentioned, in, weather, forecasts, and, reports, as, it, is, an, indicator, of, the, likelihood, of, dew, or, fog, in, hot, summer, weather, it, also, increases, the, apparent, temperature, to, humans, and, other, animals, by, hindering, the, evaporation, of, perspiration, from, the, skin, as, the, relative, humidity, rises, this, effect, is, calculated, as, the, heat, index, or, humidex, a, device, used, to, measure, humidity, is, called, a, hygrometer, one, used, to, regulate, it, is, called, a, humidistat, or, sometimes, hygrostat, these, are, analogous, to, a, thermometer, and, thermostat, for, temperature, respectively
