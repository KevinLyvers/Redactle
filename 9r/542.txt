bronze, is, an, alloy, consisting, primarily, of, copper, commonly, with, about, 12, 12, 5, tin, and, often, with, the, addition, of, other, metals, including, aluminium, manganese, nickel, or, zinc, and, sometimes, non, metals, such, as, phosphorus, or, metalloids, such, as, arsenic, or, silicon, these, additions, produce, a, range, of, alloys, that, may, be, harder, than, copper, alone, or, have, other, useful, properties, such, as, strength, ductility, or, machinability, the, archaeological, period, in, which, bronze, was, the, hardest, metal, in, widespread, use, is, known, as, the, bronze, age, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, in, western, eurasia, and, india, is, conventionally, dated, to, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, 3500, bc, and, to, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, in, china, elsewhere, it, gradually, spread, across, regions, the, bronze, age, was, followed, by, the, iron, age, starting, about, 1300, bc, and, reaching, most, of, eurasia, by, about, 500, bc, although, bronze, continued, to, be, much, more, widely, used, than, it, is, in, modern, times, because, historical, artworks, were, often, made, of, brasses, copper, and, zinc, and, bronzes, of, different, metallic, compositions, modern, museum, and, scholarly, descriptions, of, older, artworks, increasingly, use, the, generalized, term, copper, alloy, instead, of, the, names, of, individual, alloys, this, is, done, at, least, in, part, to, prevent, database, searches, from, failing, merely, because, of, errors, or, disagreements, in, the, naming, of, historic, copper, alloys, the, word, bronze, 1730, 1740, is, borrowed, from, middle, french, bronze, 1511, itself, borrowed, from, italian, bronzo, bell, metal, brass, 13th, century, transcribed, in, medieval, latin, as, bronzium, from, either, the, discovery, of, bronze, enabled, people, to, create, metal, objects, that, were, harder, and, more, durable, than, previously, possible, bronze, tools, weapons, armor, and, building, materials, such, as, decorative, tiles, were, harder, and, more, durable, than, their, stone, and, copper, chalcolithic, predecessors, initially, bronze, was, made, out, of, copper, and, arsenic, or, from, naturally, or, artificially, mixed, ores, of, those, metals, forming, arsenic, bronze, the, earliest, known, arsenic, copper, alloy, artifacts, come, from, a, yahya, culture, period, v, 3800, 3400, bce, site, at, tal, i, iblis, on, the, iranian, plateau, and, were, smelted, from, native, arsenical, copper, and, copper, arsenides, such, as, algodonite, and, domeykite, the, earliest, tin, copper, alloy, artifact, has, been, dated, to, c, 4650, bc, in, a, vin, a, culture, site, in, plo, nik, serbia, and, believed, to, have, been, smelted, from, a, natural, tin, copper, ore, stannite, other, early, examples, date, to, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, in, egypt, susa, iran, and, some, ancient, sites, in, china, luristan, iran, tepe, sialk, iran, mundigak, afghanistan, and, mesopotamia, iraq, tin, bronze, was, superior, to, arsenic, bronze, in, that, the, alloying, process, could, be, more, easily, controlled, and, the, resulting, alloy, was, stronger, and, easier, to, cast, also, unlike, those, of, arsenic, metallic, tin, and, the, fumes, from, tin, refining, are, not, toxic, tin, became, the, major, non, copper, ingredient, of, bronze, in, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, ores, of, copper, and, the, far, rarer, tin, are, not, often, found, together, exceptions, include, cornwall, in, the, united, kingdom, one, ancient, site, in, thailand, and, one, in, iran, so, serious, bronze, work, has, always, involved, trade, with, other, regions, tin, sources, and, trade, in, ancient, times, had, a, major, influence, on, the, development, of, cultures, in, europe, a, major, source, of, tin, was, the, british, deposits, of, ore, in, cornwall, which, were, traded, as, far, as, phoenicia, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, in, many, parts, of, the, world, large, hoards, of, bronze, artifacts, are, found, suggesting, that, bronze, also, represented, a, store, of, value, and, an, indicator, of, social, status, in, europe, large, hoards, of, bronze, tools, typically, socketed, axes, illustrated, above, are, found, which, mostly, show, no, signs, of, wear, with, chinese, ritual, bronzes, which, are, documented, in, the, inscriptions, they, carry, and, from, other, sources, the, case, is, clear, these, were, made, in, enormous, quantities, for, elite, burials, and, also, used, by, the, living, for, ritual, offerings, though, bronze, is, generally, harder, than, wrought, iron, with, vickers, hardness, of, 60, 258, vs, 30, 80, the, bronze, age, gave, way, to, the, iron, age, after, a, serious, disruption, of, the, tin, trade, the, population, migrations, of, around, 1200, 1100, bc, reduced, the, shipping, of, tin, around, the, mediterranean, and, from, britain, limiting, supplies, and, raising, prices, as, the, art, of, working, in, iron, improved, iron, became, cheaper, and, improved, in, quality, as, later, cultures, advanced, from, hand, wrought, iron, to, machine, forged, iron, typically, made, with, trip, hammers, powered, by, water, blacksmiths, also, learned, how, to, make, steel, steel, is, stronger, and, harder, than, bronze, and, holds, a, sharper, edge, longer, bronze, was, still, used, during, the, iron, age, and, has, continued, in, use, for, many, purposes, to, the, modern, day, there, are, many, different, bronze, alloys, but, typically, modern, bronze, is, 88, copper, and, 12, tin, alpha, bronze, consists, of, the, alpha, solid, solution, of, tin, in, copper, alpha, bronze, alloys, of, 4, 5, tin, are, used, to, make, coins, springs, turbines, and, blades, historical, bronzes, are, highly, variable, in, composition, as, most, metalworkers, probably, used, whatever, scrap, was, on, hand, the, metal, of, the, 12th, century, english, gloucester, candlestick, is, bronze, containing, a, mixture, of, copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic, and, an, unusually, large, amount, of, silver, between, 22, 5, in, the, base, and, 5, 76, in, the, pan, below, the, candle, the, proportions, of, this, mixture, suggest, that, the, candlestick, was, made, from, a, hoard, of, old, coins, the, 13th, century, benin, bronzes, are, in, fact, brass, and, the, 12th, century, romanesque, baptismal, font, at, st, bartholomew, s, church, li, ge, is, sometimes, described, as, bronze, and, sometimes, as, brass, in, the, bronze, age, two, forms, of, bronze, were, commonly, used, classic, bronze, about, 10, tin, was, used, in, casting, and, mild, bronze, about, 6, tin, was, hammered, from, ingots, to, make, sheets, bladed, weapons, were, mostly, cast, from, classic, bronze, while, helmets, and, armor, were, hammered, from, mild, bronze, modern, commercial, bronze, 90, copper, and, 10, zinc, and, architectural, bronze, 57, copper, 3, lead, 40, zinc, are, more, properly, regarded, as, brass, alloys, because, they, contain, zinc, as, the, main, alloying, ingredient, they, are, commonly, used, in, architectural, applications, plastic, bronze, contains, a, significant, quantity, of, lead, which, makes, for, improved, plasticity, and, was, possibly, used, by, the, ancient, greeks, in, ship, construction, silicon, bronze, has, a, composition, of, si, 2, 80, 3, 80, mn, 0, 50, 1, 30, fe, 0, 80, max, zn, 1, 50, max, pb, 0, 05, max, cu, balance, other, bronze, alloys, include, aluminium, bronze, phosphor, bronze, manganese, bronze, bell, metal, arsenical, bronze, speculum, metal, bismuth, bronze, and, cymbal, alloys, copper, based, alloys, have, lower, melting, points, than, steel, or, iron, and, are, more, readily, produced, from, their, constituent, metals, they, are, generally, about, 10, percent, denser, than, steel, although, alloys, using, aluminum, or, silicon, may, be, slightly, less, dense, bronze, is, a, better, conductor, of, heat, and, electricity, than, most, steels, the, cost, of, copper, base, alloys, is, generally, higher, than, that, of, steels, but, lower, than, that, of, nickel, base, alloys, bronzes, are, typically, ductile, alloys, considerably, less, brittle, than, cast, iron, copper, and, its, alloys, have, a, huge, variety, of, uses, that, reflect, their, versatile, physical, mechanical, and, chemical, properties, some, common, examples, are, the, high, electrical, conductivity, of, pure, copper, low, friction, properties, of, bearing, bronze, bronze, that, has, a, high, lead, content, 6, 8, resonant, qualities, of, bell, bronze, 20, tin, 80, copper, and, resistance, to, corrosion, by, seawater, of, several, bronze, alloys, the, melting, point, of, bronze, varies, depending, on, the, ratio, of, the, alloy, components, and, is, about, 950, c, 1, 742, f, bronze, is, usually, nonmagnetic, but, certain, alloys, containing, iron, or, nickel, may, have, magnetic, properties, typically, bronze, oxidizes, only, superficially, once, a, copper, oxide, eventually, becoming, copper, carbonate, layer, is, formed, the, underlying, metal, is, protected, from, further, corrosion, this, can, be, seen, on, statues, from, the, hellenistic, period, if, copper, chlorides, are, formed, a, corrosion, mode, called, bronze, disease, will, eventually, completely, destroy, it, bronze, or, bronze, like, alloys, and, mixtures, were, used, for, coins, over, a, longer, period, bronze, was, especially, suitable, for, use, in, boat, and, ship, fittings, prior, to, the, wide, employment, of, stainless, steel, owing, to, its, combination, of, toughness, and, resistance, to, salt, water, corrosion, bronze, is, still, commonly, used, in, ship, propellers, and, submerged, bearings, in, the, 20th, century, silicon, was, introduced, as, the, primary, alloying, element, creating, an, alloy, with, wide, application, in, industry, and, the, major, form, used, in, contemporary, statuary, sculptors, may, prefer, silicon, bronze, because, of, the, ready, availability, of, silicon, bronze, brazing, rod, which, allows, color, matched, repair, of, defects, in, castings, aluminum, is, also, used, for, the, structural, metal, aluminum, bronze, bronze, parts, are, tough, and, typically, used, for, bearings, clips, electrical, connectors, and, springs, bronze, also, has, low, friction, against, dissimilar, metals, making, it, important, for, cannons, prior, to, modern, tolerancing, where, iron, cannonballs, would, otherwise, stick, in, the, barrel, it, is, still, widely, used, today, for, springs, bearings, bushings, automobile, transmission, pilot, bearings, and, similar, fittings, and, is, particularly, common, in, the, bearings, of, small, electric, motors, phosphor, bronze, is, particularly, suited, to, precision, grade, bearings, and, springs, it, is, also, used, in, guitar, and, piano, strings, unlike, steel, bronze, struck, against, a, hard, surface, will, not, generate, sparks, so, it, along, with, beryllium, copper, is, used, to, make, hammers, mallets, wrenches, and, other, durable, tools, to, be, used, in, explosive, atmospheres, or, in, the, presence, of, flammable, vapors, bronze, is, used, to, make, bronze, wool, for, woodworking, applications, where, steel, wool, would, discolor, oak, phosphor, bronze, is, used, for, ships, propellers, musical, instruments, and, electrical, contacts, bearings, are, often, made, of, bronze, for, its, friction, properties, it, can, be, impregnated, with, oil, to, make, the, proprietary, oilite, and, similar, material, for, bearings, aluminum, bronze, is, hard, and, wear, resistant, and, is, used, for, bearings, and, machine, tool, ways, the, doehler, die, casting, co, of, toledo, ohio, were, known, for, the, production, of, brastil, a, high, tensile, corrosion, resistant, bronze, alloy, the, seagram, building, on, new, york, city, s, park, avenue, is, the, iconic, glass, box, sheathed, in, bronze, designed, by, mies, van, der, rohe, the, seagram, building, was, the, first, time, that, an, entire, building, was, sheathed, in, bronze, the, general, bronze, corporation, fabricated, 3, 200, 000, pounds, 1, 600, tons, of, bronze, at, its, plant, in, garden, city, new, york, the, seagram, building, is, a, 38, story, 516, foot, bronze, and, topaz, tinted, glass, building, the, building, looks, like, a, squarish, 38, story, tower, clad, in, a, restrained, curtain, wall, of, metal, and, glass, bronze, was, selected, because, of, its, color, both, before, and, after, aging, its, corrosion, resistance, and, its, extrusion, properties, it, was, not, only, the, most, expensive, building, of, its, time, 36, million, but, it, was, the, first, building, in, the, world, with, floor, to, ceiling, glass, walls, mies, van, der, rohe, achieved, the, crisp, edges, that, were, custom, made, with, specific, detailing, by, general, bronze, and, even, the, screws, that, hold, in, the, fixed, glass, plate, windows, were, made, of, brass, bronze, is, widely, used, for, casting, bronze, sculptures, common, bronze, alloys, have, the, unusual, and, desirable, property, of, expanding, slightly, just, before, they, set, thus, filling, the, finest, details, of, a, mould, then, as, the, bronze, cools, it, shrinks, a, little, making, it, easier, to, separate, from, the, mould, the, assyrian, king, sennacherib, 704, 681, bc, claims, to, have, been, the, first, to, cast, monumental, bronze, statues, of, up, to, 30, tonnes, using, two, part, moulds, instead, of, the, lost, wax, method, bronze, statues, were, regarded, as, the, highest, form, of, sculpture, in, ancient, greek, art, though, survivals, are, few, as, bronze, was, a, valuable, material, in, short, supply, in, the, late, antique, and, medieval, periods, many, of, the, most, famous, greek, bronze, sculptures, are, known, through, roman, copies, in, marble, which, were, more, likely, to, survive, in, india, bronze, sculptures, from, the, kushana, chausa, hoard, and, gupta, periods, brahma, from, mirpur, khas, akota, hoard, sultanganj, buddha, and, later, periods, hansi, hoard, have, been, found, indian, hindu, artisans, from, the, period, of, the, chola, empire, in, tamil, nadu, used, bronze, to, create, intricate, statues, via, the, lost, wax, casting, method, with, ornate, detailing, depicting, the, deities, of, hinduism, the, art, form, survives, to, this, day, with, many, silpis, craftsmen, working, in, the, areas, of, swamimalai, and, chennai, in, antiquity, other, cultures, also, produced, works, of, high, art, using, bronze, for, example, in, africa, the, bronze, heads, of, the, kingdom, of, benin, in, europe, grecian, bronzes, typically, of, figures, from, greek, mythology, in, east, asia, chinese, ritual, bronzes, of, the, shang, and, zhou, dynasty, more, often, ceremonial, vessels, but, including, some, figurine, examples, bronze, continues, into, modern, times, as, one, of, the, materials, of, choice, for, monumental, statuary, tiffany, glass, studios, made, famous, by, louis, c, tiffany, commonly, referred, to, his, product, as, favrile, glass, or, tiffany, glass, and, used, bronze, in, their, artisan, work, for, his, tiffany, lamps, the, largest, and, most, ornate, bronze, fountain, known, to, be, cast, in, the, world, was, by, the, roman, bronze, works, and, general, bronze, corporation, in, 1952, the, material, used, for, the, fountain, known, as, statuary, bronze, is, a, quaternary, alloy, made, of, copper, zinc, tin, and, lead, and, traditionally, golden, brown, in, color, this, was, made, for, the, andrew, w, mellon, memorial, fountain, in, federal, triangle, in, washington, dc, another, example, of, the, massive, ornate, design, projects, of, bronze, and, attributed, to, general, bronze, roman, bronze, works, were, the, massive, bronze, doors, to, the, united, states, supreme, court, building, in, washington, dc, before, it, became, possible, to, produce, glass, with, acceptably, flat, surfaces, bronze, was, a, standard, material, for, mirrors, bronze, was, used, for, this, purpose, in, many, parts, of, the, world, probably, based, on, independent, discoveries, bronze, mirrors, survive, from, the, egyptian, middle, kingdom, 2040, 1750, bc, and, china, from, at, least, c, 550, bc, in, europe, the, etruscans, were, making, bronze, mirrors, in, the, sixth, century, bc, and, greek, and, roman, mirrors, followed, the, same, pattern, although, other, materials, such, as, speculum, metal, had, come, into, use, and, western, glass, mirrors, had, largely, taken, over, bronze, mirrors, were, still, being, made, in, japan, and, elsewhere, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, are, still, made, on, a, small, scale, in, kerala, india, bronze, is, the, preferred, metal, for, bells, in, the, form, of, a, high, tin, bronze, alloy, known, as, bell, metal, which, is, typically, about, 23, tin, nearly, all, professional, cymbals, are, made, from, bronze, which, gives, a, desirable, balance, of, durability, and, timbre, several, types, of, bronze, are, used, commonly, b20, bronze, which, is, roughly, 20, tin, 80, copper, with, traces, of, silver, or, the, tougher, b8, bronze, made, from, 8, tin, and, 92, copper, as, the, tin, content, in, a, bell, or, cymbal, rises, the, timbre, drops, bronze, is, also, used, for, the, windings, of, steel, and, nylon, strings, of, various, stringed, instruments, such, as, the, double, bass, piano, harpsichord, and, guitar, bronze, strings, are, commonly, reserved, on, pianoforte, for, the, lower, pitch, tones, as, they, possess, a, superior, sustain, quality, to, that, of, high, tensile, steel, bronzes, of, various, metallurgical, properties, are, widely, used, in, struck, idiophones, around, the, world, notably, bells, singing, bowls, gongs, cymbals, and, other, idiophones, from, asia, examples, include, tibetan, singing, bowls, temple, bells, of, many, sizes, and, shapes, javanese, gamelan, and, other, bronze, musical, instruments, the, earliest, bronze, archeological, finds, in, indonesia, date, from, 1, 2, bc, including, flat, plates, probably, suspended, and, struck, by, a, wooden, or, bone, mallet, ancient, bronze, drums, from, thailand, and, vietnam, date, back, 2, 000, years, bronze, bells, from, thailand, and, cambodia, date, back, to, 3600, bc, some, companies, are, now, making, saxophones, from, phosphor, bronze, 3, 5, to, 10, tin, and, up, to, 1, phosphorus, content, bell, bronze, b20, is, used, to, make, the, tone, rings, of, many, professional, model, banjos, the, tone, ring, is, a, heavy, usually, 3, lb, 1, 4, kg, folded, or, arched, metal, ring, attached, to, a, thick, wood, rim, over, which, a, skin, or, most, often, a, plastic, membrane, or, head, is, stretched, it, is, the, bell, bronze, that, gives, the, banjo, a, crisp, powerful, lower, register, and, clear, bell, like, treble, register, bronze, has, also, been, used, in, coins, most, copper, coins, are, actually, bronze, with, about, 4, percent, tin, and, 1, percent, zinc, as, with, coins, bronze, has, been, used, in, the, manufacture, of, various, types, of, medals, for, centuries, and, bronze, medals, are, known, in, contemporary, times, for, being, awarded, for, third, place, in, sporting, competitions, and, other, events, the, term, is, now, often, used, for, third, place, even, when, no, actual, bronze, medal, is, awarded, the, usage, in, part, arose, from, the, trio, of, gold, silver, and, bronze, to, represent, the, first, three, ages, of, man, in, greek, mythology, the, golden, age, when, men, lived, among, the, gods, the, silver, age, where, youth, lasted, a, hundred, years, and, the, bronze, age, the, era, of, heroes, it, was, first, adopted, for, a, sports, event, at, the, 1904, summer, olympics, at, the, 1896, event, silver, was, awarded, to, winners, and, bronze, to, runners, up, while, at, 1900, other, prizes, were, given, rather, than, medals, bronze, is, the, normal, material, for, the, related, form, of, the, plaquette, normally, a, rectangular, work, of, art, with, a, scene, in, relief, for, a, collectors, market, there, are, over, 125, references, to, bronze, nehoshet, which, appears, to, be, the, hebrew, word, used, for, copper, and, any, of, its, alloys, however, the, old, testament, era, hebrews, are, not, thought, to, have, had, the, capability, to, manufacture, zinc, needed, to, make, brass, and, so, it, is, likely, that, nehoshet, refers, to, copper, and, its, alloys, with, tin, now, called, bronze, in, the, king, james, version, there, is, no, use, of, the, word, bronze, and, nehoshet, was, translated, as, brass, modern, translations, use, bronze, bronze, nehoshet, was, used, widely, in, the, tabernacle, for, items, such, as, the, bronze, altar, exodus, ch, 27, bronze, laver, exodus, ch, 30, utensils, and, mirror, exodus, ch, 38, it, was, mentioned, in, the, account, of, moses, holding, up, a, bronze, snake, on, a, pole, in, numbers, ch, 21, in, first, kings, it, is, mentioned, that, hiram, was, very, skilled, in, working, with, bronze, and, he, made, many, furnishings, for, solomon, s, temple, including, pillars, capitals, stands, wheels, bowls, and, plates, some, of, which, were, highly, decorative, see, i, kings, 7, 13, 47, bronze, was, also, widely, used, as, battle, armor, and, helmet, as, in, the, battle, of, david, and, goliath, in, i, samuel, 17, 5, 6, 38, also, see, ii, chron, 12, 10
