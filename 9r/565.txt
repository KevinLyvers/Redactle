in, geology, the, crust, is, the, outermost, solid, shell, of, a, planet, dwarf, planet, or, natural, satellite, it, is, usually, distinguished, from, the, underlying, mantle, by, its, chemical, makeup, however, in, the, case, of, icy, satellites, it, may, be, distinguished, based, on, its, phase, solid, crust, vs, liquid, mantle, the, crusts, of, earth, mercury, venus, mars, io, the, moon, and, other, planetary, bodies, formed, via, igneous, processes, and, were, later, modified, by, erosion, impact, cratering, volcanism, and, sedimentation, most, terrestrial, planets, have, fairly, uniform, crusts, earth, however, has, two, distinct, types, continental, crust, and, oceanic, crust, these, two, types, have, different, chemical, compositions, and, physical, properties, and, were, formed, by, different, geological, processes, planetary, geologists, divide, crust, into, three, categories, based, on, how, and, when, it, formed, this, is, a, planet, s, original, crust, it, forms, from, solidification, of, a, magma, ocean, toward, the, end, of, planetary, accretion, the, terrestrial, planets, likely, had, surfaces, that, were, magma, oceans, as, these, cooled, they, solidified, into, crust, this, crust, was, likely, destroyed, by, large, impacts, and, re, formed, many, times, as, the, era, of, heavy, bombardment, drew, to, a, close, the, nature, of, primary, crust, is, still, debated, its, chemical, mineralogic, and, physical, properties, are, unknown, as, are, the, igneous, mechanisms, that, formed, them, this, is, because, it, is, difficult, to, study, none, of, earth, s, primary, crust, has, survived, to, today, earth, s, high, rates, of, erosion, and, crustal, recycling, from, plate, tectonics, has, destroyed, all, rocks, older, than, about, 4, billion, years, including, whatever, primary, crust, earth, once, had, however, geologists, can, glean, information, about, primary, crust, by, studying, it, on, other, terrestrial, planets, mercury, s, highlands, might, represent, primary, crust, though, this, is, debated, the, anorthosite, highlands, of, the, moon, are, primary, crust, formed, as, plagioclase, crystallized, out, of, the, moon, s, initial, magma, ocean, and, floated, to, the, top, however, it, is, unlikely, that, earth, followed, a, similar, pattern, as, the, moon, was, a, water, less, system, and, earth, had, water, the, martian, meteorite, alh84001, might, represent, primary, crust, of, mars, however, again, this, is, debated, like, earth, venus, lacks, primary, crust, as, the, entire, planet, has, been, repeatedly, resurfaced, and, modified, secondary, crust, is, formed, by, partial, melting, of, mostly, silicate, materials, in, the, mantle, and, so, is, usually, basaltic, in, composition, this, is, the, most, common, type, of, crust, in, the, solar, system, most, of, the, surfaces, of, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, comprise, secondary, crust, as, do, the, lunar, maria, on, earth, secondary, crust, forms, primarily, at, mid, ocean, spreading, centers, where, the, adiabatic, rise, of, mantle, causes, partial, melting, tertiary, crust, is, more, chemically, modified, than, either, primary, or, secondary, it, can, form, in, several, ways, the, only, known, example, of, tertiary, crust, is, the, continental, crust, of, the, earth, it, is, unknown, whether, other, terrestrial, planets, can, be, said, to, have, tertiary, crust, though, the, evidence, so, far, suggests, that, they, do, not, this, is, likely, because, plate, tectonics, is, needed, to, create, tertiary, crust, and, earth, is, the, only, planet, in, the, solar, system, with, plate, tectonics, earth, s, crust, is, a, thin, shell, on, the, outside, of, earth, accounting, for, less, than, 1, of, earth, s, volume, it, is, the, top, component, of, the, lithosphere, a, division, of, earth, s, layers, that, includes, the, crust, and, the, upper, part, of, the, mantle, the, lithosphere, is, broken, into, tectonic, plates, that, move, allowing, heat, to, escape, from, the, interior, of, earth, into, space, a, theoretical, protoplanet, named, theia, is, thought, to, have, collided, with, the, forming, earth, and, part, of, the, material, ejected, into, space, by, the, collision, accreted, to, form, the, moon, as, the, moon, formed, the, outer, part, of, it, is, thought, to, have, been, molten, a, lunar, magma, ocean, plagioclase, feldspar, crystallized, in, large, amounts, from, this, magma, ocean, and, floated, toward, the, surface, the, cumulate, rocks, form, much, of, the, crust, the, upper, part, of, the, crust, probably, averages, about, 88, plagioclase, near, the, lower, limit, of, 90, defined, for, anorthosite, the, lower, part, of, the, crust, may, contain, a, higher, percentage, of, ferromagnesian, minerals, such, as, the, pyroxenes, and, olivine, but, even, that, lower, part, probably, averages, about, 78, plagioclase, the, underlying, mantle, is, denser, and, olivine, rich, the, thickness, of, the, crust, ranges, between, about, 20, and, 120, km, crust, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, averages, about, 12, km, thicker, than, that, on, the, near, side, estimates, of, average, thickness, fall, in, the, range, from, about, 50, to, 60, km, most, of, this, plagioclase, rich, crust, formed, shortly, after, formation, of, the, moon, between, about, 4, 5, and, 4, 3, billion, years, ago, perhaps, 10, or, less, of, the, crust, consists, of, igneous, rock, added, after, the, formation, of, the, initial, plagioclase, rich, material, the, best, characterized, and, most, voluminous, of, these, later, additions, are, the, mare, basalts, formed, between, about, 3, 9, and, 3, 2, billion, years, ago, minor, volcanism, continued, after, 3, 2, billion, years, perhaps, as, recently, as, 1, billion, years, ago, there, is, no, evidence, of, plate, tectonics, study, of, the, moon, has, established, that, a, crust, can, form, on, a, rocky, planetary, body, significantly, smaller, than, earth, although, the, radius, of, the, moon, is, only, about, a, quarter, that, of, earth, the, lunar, crust, has, a, significantly, greater, average, thickness, this, thick, crust, formed, almost, immediately, after, formation, of, the, moon, magmatism, continued, after, the, period, of, intense, meteorite, impacts, ended, about, 3, 9, billion, years, ago, but, igneous, rocks, younger, than, 3, 9, billion, years, make, up, only, a, minor, part, of, the, crust
