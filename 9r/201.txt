cosmic, rays, or, astroparticles, are, high, energy, particles, or, clusters, of, particles, primarily, represented, by, protons, or, atomic, nuclei, that, move, through, space, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, they, originate, from, the, sun, from, outside, of, the, solar, system, in, our, own, galaxy, and, from, distant, galaxies, upon, impact, with, earth, s, atmosphere, cosmic, rays, produce, showers, of, secondary, particles, some, of, which, reach, the, surface, although, the, bulk, are, deflected, off, into, space, by, the, magnetosphere, or, the, heliosphere, cosmic, rays, were, discovered, by, victor, hess, in, 1912, in, balloon, experiments, for, which, he, was, awarded, the, 1936, nobel, prize, in, physics, direct, measurement, of, cosmic, rays, especially, at, lower, energies, has, been, possible, since, the, launch, of, the, first, satellites, in, the, late, 1950s, particle, detectors, similar, to, those, used, in, nuclear, and, high, energy, physics, are, used, on, satellites, and, space, probes, for, research, into, cosmic, rays, data, from, the, fermi, space, telescope, 2013, have, been, interpreted, as, evidence, that, a, significant, fraction, of, primary, cosmic, rays, originate, from, the, supernova, explosions, of, stars, based, on, observations, of, neutrinos, and, gamma, rays, from, blazar, txs, 0506, 056, in, 2018, active, galactic, nuclei, also, appear, to, produce, cosmic, rays, the, term, ray, as, in, optical, ray, seems, to, have, arisen, from, an, initial, belief, due, to, their, penetrating, power, that, cosmic, rays, were, mostly, electromagnetic, radiation, nevertheless, following, wider, recognition, of, cosmic, rays, as, being, various, high, energy, particles, with, intrinsic, mass, the, term, rays, was, still, consistent, with, then, known, particles, such, as, cathode, rays, canal, rays, alpha, rays, and, beta, rays, meanwhile, cosmic, ray, photons, which, are, quanta, of, electromagnetic, radiation, and, so, have, no, intrinsic, mass, are, known, by, their, common, names, such, as, gamma, rays, or, x, rays, depending, on, their, photon, energy, of, primary, cosmic, rays, which, originate, outside, of, earth, s, atmosphere, about, 99, are, the, bare, nuclei, of, common, atoms, stripped, of, their, electron, shells, and, about, 1, are, solitary, electrons, that, is, one, type, of, beta, particle, of, the, nuclei, about, 90, are, simple, protons, i, e, hydrogen, nuclei, 9, are, alpha, particles, identical, to, helium, nuclei, and, 1, are, the, nuclei, of, heavier, elements, called, hze, ions, these, fractions, vary, highly, over, the, energy, range, of, cosmic, rays, a, very, small, fraction, are, stable, particles, of, antimatter, such, as, positrons, or, antiprotons, the, precise, nature, of, this, remaining, fraction, is, an, area, of, active, research, an, active, search, from, earth, orbit, for, anti, alpha, particles, as, of, 2019, had, found, no, unequivocal, evidence, upon, striking, the, atmosphere, cosmic, rays, violently, burst, atoms, into, other, bits, of, matter, producing, large, amounts, of, pions, and, muons, produced, from, the, decay, of, charged, pions, which, have, a, short, half, life, as, well, as, neutrinos, the, neutron, composition, of, the, particle, cascade, increases, at, lower, elevations, reaching, between, 40, and, 80, of, the, radiation, at, aircraft, altitudes, of, secondary, cosmic, rays, the, charged, pions, produced, by, primary, cosmic, rays, in, the, atmosphere, swiftly, decay, emitting, muons, unlike, pions, these, muons, do, not, interact, strongly, with, matter, and, can, travel, through, the, atmosphere, to, penetrate, even, below, ground, level, the, rate, of, muons, arriving, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, such, that, about, one, per, second, passes, through, a, volume, the, size, of, a, person, s, head, together, with, natural, local, radioactivity, these, muons, are, a, significant, cause, of, the, ground, level, atmospheric, ionisation, that, first, attracted, the, attention, of, scientists, leading, to, the, eventual, discovery, of, the, primary, cosmic, rays, arriving, from, beyond, our, atmosphere, cosmic, rays, attract, great, interest, practically, due, to, the, damage, they, inflict, on, microelectronics, and, life, outside, the, protection, of, an, atmosphere, and, magnetic, field, and, scientifically, because, the, energies, of, the, most, energetic, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, have, been, observed, to, approach, 3, 10, 20, ev, this, is, slightly, greater, than, 21, million, times, the, design, energy, of, particles, accelerated, by, the, large, hadron, collider, 14, teraelectronvolts, 1, 4, 10, 13, ev, one, can, show, that, such, enormous, energies, might, be, achieved, by, means, of, the, centrifugal, mechanism, of, acceleration, in, active, galactic, nuclei, at, 50, joules, 3, 1, 10, 11, gev, the, highest, energy, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, such, as, the, omg, particle, recorded, in, 1991, have, energies, comparable, to, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, 90, kilometre, per, hour, 56, mph, baseball, as, a, result, of, these, discoveries, there, has, been, interest, in, investigating, cosmic, rays, of, even, greater, energies, most, cosmic, rays, however, do, not, have, such, extreme, energies, the, energy, distribution, of, cosmic, rays, peaks, at, 300, megaelectronvolts, 4, 8, 10, 11, j, after, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, by, henri, becquerel, in, 1896, it, was, generally, believed, that, atmospheric, electricity, ionization, of, the, air, was, caused, only, by, radiation, from, radioactive, elements, in, the, ground, or, the, radioactive, gases, or, isotopes, of, radon, they, produce, measurements, of, increasing, ionization, rates, at, increasing, heights, above, the, ground, during, the, decade, from, 1900, to, 1910, could, be, explained, as, due, to, absorption, of, the, ionizing, radiation, by, the, intervening, air, in, 1909, theodor, wulf, developed, an, electrometer, a, device, to, measure, the, rate, of, ion, production, inside, a, hermetically, sealed, container, and, used, it, to, show, higher, levels, of, radiation, at, the, top, of, the, eiffel, tower, than, at, its, base, however, his, paper, published, in, physikalische, zeitschrift, was, not, widely, accepted, in, 1911, domenico, pacini, observed, simultaneous, variations, of, the, rate, of, ionization, over, a, lake, over, the, sea, and, at, a, depth, of, 3, metres, from, the, surface, pacini, concluded, from, the, decrease, of, radioactivity, underwater, that, a, certain, part, of, the, ionization, must, be, due, to, sources, other, than, the, radioactivity, of, the, earth, in, 1912, victor, hess, carried, three, enhanced, accuracy, wulf, electrometers, to, an, altitude, of, 5, 300, metres, in, a, free, balloon, flight, he, found, the, ionization, rate, increased, approximately, fourfold, over, the, rate, at, ground, level, hess, ruled, out, the, sun, as, the, radiation, s, source, by, making, a, balloon, ascent, during, a, near, total, eclipse, with, the, moon, blocking, much, of, the, sun, s, visible, radiation, hess, still, measured, rising, radiation, at, rising, altitudes, he, concluded, that, the, results, of, the, observations, seem, most, likely, to, be, explained, by, the, assumption, that, radiation, of, very, high, penetrating, power, enters, from, above, into, our, atmosphere, in, 1913, 1914, werner, kolh, rster, confirmed, victor, hess, s, earlier, results, by, measuring, the, increased, ionization, enthalpy, rate, at, an, altitude, of, 9, km, hess, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1936, for, his, discovery, bruno, rossi, wrote, in, 1964, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, the, technique, of, self, recording, electroscopes, carried, by, balloons, into, the, highest, layers, of, the, atmosphere, or, sunk, to, great, depths, under, water, was, brought, to, an, unprecedented, degree, of, perfection, by, the, german, physicist, erich, regener, and, his, group, to, these, scientists, we, owe, some, of, the, most, accurate, measurements, ever, made, of, cosmic, ray, ionization, as, a, function, of, altitude, and, depth, ernest, rutherford, stated, in, 1931, that, thanks, to, the, fine, experiments, of, professor, millikan, and, the, even, more, far, reaching, experiments, of, professor, regener, we, have, now, got, for, the, first, time, a, curve, of, absorption, of, these, radiations, in, water, which, we, may, safely, rely, upon, in, the, 1920s, the, term, cosmic, ray, was, coined, by, robert, millikan, who, made, measurements, of, ionization, due, to, cosmic, rays, from, deep, under, water, to, high, altitudes, and, around, the, globe, millikan, believed, that, his, measurements, proved, that, the, primary, cosmic, rays, were, gamma, rays, i, e, energetic, photons, and, he, proposed, a, theory, that, they, were, produced, in, interstellar, space, as, by, products, of, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, atoms, into, the, heavier, elements, and, that, secondary, electrons, were, produced, in, the, atmosphere, by, compton, scattering, of, gamma, rays, in, 1927, while, sailing, from, java, to, the, netherlands, jacob, clay, found, evidence, later, confirmed, in, many, experiments, that, cosmic, ray, intensity, increases, from, the, tropics, to, mid, latitudes, which, indicated, that, the, primary, cosmic, rays, are, deflected, by, the, geomagnetic, field, and, must, therefore, be, charged, particles, not, photons, in, 1929, bothe, and, kolh, rster, discovered, charged, cosmic, ray, particles, that, could, penetrate, 4, 1, cm, of, gold, charged, particles, of, such, high, energy, could, not, possibly, be, produced, by, photons, from, millikan, s, proposed, interstellar, fusion, process, in, 1930, bruno, rossi, predicted, a, difference, between, the, intensities, of, cosmic, rays, arriving, from, the, east, and, the, west, that, depends, upon, the, charge, of, the, primary, particles, the, so, called, east, west, effect, three, independent, experiments, found, that, the, intensity, is, in, fact, greater, from, the, west, proving, that, most, primaries, are, positive, during, the, years, from, 1930, to, 1945, a, wide, variety, of, investigations, confirmed, that, the, primary, cosmic, rays, are, mostly, protons, and, the, secondary, radiation, produced, in, the, atmosphere, is, primarily, electrons, photons, and, muons, in, 1948, observations, with, nuclear, emulsions, carried, by, balloons, to, near, the, top, of, the, atmosphere, showed, that, approximately, 10, of, the, primaries, are, helium, nuclei, alpha, particles, and, 1, are, nuclei, of, heavier, elements, such, as, carbon, iron, and, lead, during, a, test, of, his, equipment, for, measuring, the, east, west, effect, rossi, observed, that, the, rate, of, near, simultaneous, discharges, of, two, widely, separated, geiger, counters, was, larger, than, the, expected, accidental, rate, in, his, report, on, the, experiment, rossi, wrote, it, seems, that, once, in, a, while, the, recording, equipment, is, struck, by, very, extensive, showers, of, particles, which, causes, coincidences, between, the, counters, even, placed, at, large, distances, from, one, another, in, 1937, pierre, auger, unaware, of, rossi, s, earlier, report, detected, the, same, phenomenon, and, investigated, it, in, some, detail, he, concluded, that, high, energy, primary, cosmic, ray, particles, interact, with, air, nuclei, high, in, the, atmosphere, initiating, a, cascade, of, secondary, interactions, that, ultimately, yield, a, shower, of, electrons, and, photons, that, reach, ground, level, soviet, physicist, sergei, vernov, was, the, first, to, use, radiosondes, to, perform, cosmic, ray, readings, with, an, instrument, carried, to, high, altitude, by, a, balloon, on, 1, april, 1935, he, took, measurements, at, heights, up, to, 13, 6, kilometres, using, a, pair, of, geiger, counters, in, an, anti, coincidence, circuit, to, avoid, counting, secondary, ray, showers, homi, j, bhabha, derived, an, expression, for, the, probability, of, scattering, positrons, by, electrons, a, process, now, known, as, bhabha, scattering, his, classic, paper, jointly, with, walter, heitler, published, in, 1937, described, how, primary, cosmic, rays, from, space, interact, with, the, upper, atmosphere, to, produce, particles, observed, at, the, ground, level, bhabha, and, heitler, explained, the, cosmic, ray, shower, formation, by, the, cascade, production, of, gamma, rays, and, positive, and, negative, electron, pairs, measurements, of, the, energy, and, arrival, directions, of, the, ultra, high, energy, primary, cosmic, rays, by, the, techniques, of, density, sampling, and, fast, timing, of, extensive, air, showers, were, first, carried, out, in, 1954, by, members, of, the, rossi, cosmic, ray, group, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, the, experiment, employed, eleven, scintillation, detectors, arranged, within, a, circle, 460, metres, in, diameter, on, the, grounds, of, the, agassiz, station, of, the, harvard, college, observatory, from, that, work, and, from, many, other, experiments, carried, out, all, over, the, world, the, energy, spectrum, of, the, primary, cosmic, rays, is, now, known, to, extend, beyond, 10, 20, ev, a, huge, air, shower, experiment, called, the, auger, project, is, currently, operated, at, a, site, on, the, pampas, of, argentina, by, an, international, consortium, of, physicists, the, project, was, first, led, by, james, cronin, winner, of, the, 1980, nobel, prize, in, physics, from, the, university, of, chicago, and, alan, watson, of, the, university, of, leeds, and, later, by, scientists, of, the, international, pierre, auger, collaboration, their, aim, is, to, explore, the, properties, and, arrival, directions, of, the, very, highest, energy, primary, cosmic, rays, the, results, are, expected, to, have, important, implications, for, particle, physics, and, cosmology, due, to, a, theoretical, greisen, zatsepin, kuzmin, limit, to, the, energies, of, cosmic, rays, from, long, distances, about, 160, million, light, years, which, occurs, above, 10, 20, ev, because, of, interactions, with, the, remnant, photons, from, the, big, bang, origin, of, the, universe, currently, the, pierre, auger, observatory, is, undergoing, an, upgrade, to, improve, its, accuracy, and, find, evidence, for, the, yet, unconfirmed, origin, of, the, most, energetic, cosmic, rays, high, energy, gamma, rays, 50, mev, photons, were, finally, discovered, in, the, primary, cosmic, radiation, by, an, mit, experiment, carried, on, the, oso, 3, satellite, in, 1967, components, of, both, galactic, and, extra, galactic, origins, were, separately, identified, at, intensities, much, less, than, 1, of, the, primary, charged, particles, since, then, numerous, satellite, gamma, ray, observatories, have, mapped, the, gamma, ray, sky, the, most, recent, is, the, fermi, observatory, which, has, produced, a, map, showing, a, narrow, band, of, gamma, ray, intensity, produced, in, discrete, and, diffuse, sources, in, our, galaxy, and, numerous, point, like, extra, galactic, sources, distributed, over, the, celestial, sphere, the, solar, cycle, causes, variations, in, the, magnetic, field, of, the, solar, wind, through, which, cosmic, rays, propagate, to, earth, this, results, in, a, modulation, of, the, arriving, fluxes, at, lower, energies, as, detected, indirectly, by, the, globally, distributed, neutron, monitor, network, early, speculation, on, the, sources, of, cosmic, rays, included, a, 1934, proposal, by, baade, and, zwicky, suggesting, cosmic, rays, originated, from, supernovae, a, 1948, proposal, by, horace, w, babcock, suggested, that, magnetic, variable, stars, could, be, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, subsequently, sekido, et, al, 1951, identified, the, crab, nebula, as, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, since, then, a, wide, variety, of, potential, sources, for, cosmic, rays, began, to, surface, including, supernovae, active, galactic, nuclei, quasars, and, gamma, ray, bursts, later, experiments, have, helped, to, identify, the, sources, of, cosmic, rays, with, greater, certainty, in, 2009, a, paper, presented, at, the, international, cosmic, ray, conference, by, scientists, at, the, pierre, auger, observatory, in, argentina, showed, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, originating, from, a, location, in, the, sky, very, close, to, the, radio, galaxy, centaurus, a, although, the, authors, specifically, stated, that, further, investigation, would, be, required, to, confirm, centaurus, a, as, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, however, no, correlation, was, found, between, the, incidence, of, gamma, ray, bursts, and, cosmic, rays, causing, the, authors, to, set, upper, limits, as, low, as, 3, 4, 10, 6, erg, cm, 2, on, the, flux, of, 1, gev, 1, tev, cosmic, rays, from, gamma, ray, bursts, in, 2009, supernovae, were, said, to, have, been, pinned, down, as, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, a, discovery, made, by, a, group, using, data, from, the, very, large, telescope, this, analysis, however, was, disputed, in, 2011, with, data, from, pamela, which, revealed, that, spectral, shapes, of, are, different, and, cannot, be, described, well, by, a, single, power, law, suggesting, a, more, complex, process, of, cosmic, ray, formation, in, february, 2013, though, research, analyzing, data, from, fermi, revealed, through, an, observation, of, neutral, pion, decay, that, supernovae, were, indeed, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, with, each, explosion, producing, roughly, 3, 10, 42, 3, 10, 43, j, of, cosmic, rays, supernovae, do, not, produce, all, cosmic, rays, however, and, the, proportion, of, cosmic, rays, that, they, do, produce, is, a, question, which, cannot, be, answered, without, deeper, investigation, to, explain, the, actual, process, in, supernovae, and, active, galactic, nuclei, that, accelerates, the, stripped, atoms, physicists, use, shock, front, acceleration, as, a, plausibility, argument, see, picture, at, right, in, 2017, the, pierre, auger, collaboration, published, the, observation, of, a, weak, anisotropy, in, the, arrival, directions, of, the, highest, energy, cosmic, rays, since, the, galactic, center, is, in, the, deficit, region, this, anisotropy, can, be, interpreted, as, evidence, for, the, extragalactic, origin, of, cosmic, rays, at, the, highest, energies, this, implies, that, there, must, be, a, transition, energy, from, galactic, to, extragalactic, sources, and, there, may, be, different, types, of, cosmic, ray, sources, contributing, to, different, energy, ranges, cosmic, rays, can, be, divided, into, two, types, however, the, term, cosmic, ray, is, often, used, to, refer, to, only, the, extrasolar, flux, cosmic, rays, originate, as, primary, cosmic, rays, which, are, those, originally, produced, in, various, astrophysical, processes, primary, cosmic, rays, are, composed, mainly, of, protons, and, alpha, particles, 99, with, a, small, amount, of, heavier, nuclei, 1, and, an, extremely, minute, proportion, of, positrons, and, antiprotons, secondary, cosmic, rays, caused, by, a, decay, of, primary, cosmic, rays, as, they, impact, an, atmosphere, include, photons, hadrons, and, leptons, such, as, electrons, positrons, muons, and, pions, the, latter, three, of, these, were, first, detected, in, cosmic, rays, primary, cosmic, rays, mostly, originate, from, outside, the, solar, system, and, sometimes, even, outside, the, milky, way, when, they, interact, with, earth, s, atmosphere, they, are, converted, to, secondary, particles, the, mass, ratio, of, helium, to, hydrogen, nuclei, 28, is, similar, to, the, primordial, elemental, abundance, ratio, of, these, elements, 24, the, remaining, fraction, is, made, up, of, the, other, heavier, nuclei, that, are, typical, nucleosynthesis, end, products, primarily, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, these, nuclei, appear, in, cosmic, rays, in, greater, abundance, 1, than, in, the, solar, atmosphere, where, they, are, only, about, 10, 3, as, abundant, by, number, as, helium, cosmic, rays, composed, of, charged, nuclei, heavier, than, helium, are, called, hze, ions, due, to, the, high, charge, and, heavy, nature, of, hze, ions, their, contribution, to, an, astronaut, s, radiation, dose, in, space, is, significant, even, though, they, are, relatively, scarce, this, abundance, difference, is, a, result, of, the, way, in, which, secondary, cosmic, rays, are, formed, carbon, and, oxygen, nuclei, collide, with, interstellar, matter, to, form, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, an, example, of, cosmic, ray, spallation, spallation, is, also, responsible, for, the, abundances, of, scandium, titanium, vanadium, and, manganese, ions, in, cosmic, rays, produced, by, collisions, of, iron, and, nickel, nuclei, with, interstellar, matter, at, high, energies, the, composition, changes, and, heavier, nuclei, have, larger, abundances, in, some, energy, ranges, current, experiments, aim, at, more, accurate, measurements, of, the, composition, at, high, energies, satellite, experiments, have, found, evidence, of, positrons, and, a, few, antiprotons, in, primary, cosmic, rays, amounting, to, less, than, 1, of, the, particles, in, primary, cosmic, rays, these, do, not, appear, to, be, the, products, of, large, amounts, of, antimatter, from, the, big, bang, or, indeed, complex, antimatter, in, the, universe, rather, they, appear, to, consist, of, only, these, two, elementary, particles, newly, made, in, energetic, processes, preliminary, results, from, the, presently, operating, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, ams, 02, on, board, the, international, space, station, show, that, positrons, in, the, cosmic, rays, arrive, with, no, directionality, in, september, 2014, new, results, with, almost, twice, as, much, data, were, presented, in, a, talk, at, cern, and, published, in, physical, review, letters, a, new, measurement, of, positron, fraction, up, to, 500, gev, was, reported, showing, that, positron, fraction, peaks, at, a, maximum, of, about, 16, of, total, electron, positron, events, around, an, energy, of, 275, 32, gev, at, higher, energies, up, to, 500, gev, the, ratio, of, positrons, to, electrons, begins, to, fall, again, the, absolute, flux, of, positrons, also, begins, to, fall, before, 500, gev, but, peaks, at, energies, far, higher, than, electron, energies, which, peak, about, 10, gev, these, results, on, interpretation, have, been, suggested, to, be, due, to, positron, production, in, annihilation, events, of, massive, dark, matter, particles, cosmic, ray, antiprotons, also, have, a, much, higher, average, energy, than, their, normal, matter, counterparts, protons, they, arrive, at, earth, with, a, characteristic, energy, maximum, of, 2, gev, indicating, their, production, in, a, fundamentally, different, process, from, cosmic, ray, protons, which, on, average, have, only, one, sixth, of, the, energy, there, is, no, evidence, of, complex, antimatter, atomic, nuclei, such, as, antihelium, nuclei, i, e, anti, alpha, particles, in, cosmic, rays, these, are, actively, being, searched, for, a, prototype, of, the, ams, 02, designated, ams, 01, was, flown, into, space, aboard, the, space, shuttle, discovery, on, sts, 91, in, june, 1998, by, not, detecting, any, antihelium, at, all, the, ams, 01, established, an, upper, limit, of, 1, 1, 10, 6, for, the, antihelium, to, helium, flux, ratio, when, cosmic, rays, enter, the, earth, s, atmosphere, they, collide, with, atoms, and, molecules, mainly, oxygen, and, nitrogen, the, interaction, produces, a, cascade, of, lighter, particles, a, so, called, air, shower, secondary, radiation, that, rains, down, including, x, rays, protons, alpha, particles, pions, muons, electrons, neutrinos, and, neutrons, all, of, the, secondary, particles, produced, by, the, collision, continue, onward, on, paths, within, about, one, degree, of, the, primary, particle, s, original, path, typical, particles, produced, in, such, collisions, are, neutrons, and, charged, mesons, such, as, positive, or, negative, pions, and, kaons, some, of, these, subsequently, decay, into, muons, and, neutrinos, which, are, able, to, reach, the, surface, of, the, earth, some, high, energy, muons, even, penetrate, for, some, distance, into, shallow, mines, and, most, neutrinos, traverse, the, earth, without, further, interaction, others, decay, into, photons, subsequently, producing, electromagnetic, cascades, hence, next, to, photons, electrons, and, positrons, usually, dominate, in, air, showers, these, particles, as, well, as, muons, can, be, easily, detected, by, many, types, of, particle, detectors, such, as, cloud, chambers, bubble, chambers, water, cherenkov, or, scintillation, detectors, the, observation, of, a, secondary, shower, of, particles, in, multiple, detectors, at, the, same, time, is, an, indication, that, all, of, the, particles, came, from, that, event, cosmic, rays, impacting, other, planetary, bodies, in, the, solar, system, are, detected, indirectly, by, observing, high, energy, gamma, ray, emissions, by, gamma, ray, telescope, these, are, distinguished, from, radioactive, decay, processes, by, their, higher, energies, above, about, 10, mev, the, flux, of, incoming, cosmic, rays, at, the, upper, atmosphere, is, dependent, on, the, solar, wind, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, the, energy, of, the, cosmic, rays, at, distances, of, 94, au, from, the, sun, the, solar, wind, undergoes, a, transition, called, the, termination, shock, from, supersonic, to, subsonic, speeds, the, region, between, the, termination, shock, and, the, heliopause, acts, as, a, barrier, to, cosmic, rays, decreasing, the, flux, at, lower, energies, 1, gev, by, about, 90, however, the, strength, of, the, solar, wind, is, not, constant, and, hence, it, has, been, observed, that, cosmic, ray, flux, is, correlated, with, solar, activity, in, addition, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, acts, to, deflect, cosmic, rays, from, its, surface, giving, rise, to, the, observation, that, the, flux, is, apparently, dependent, on, latitude, longitude, and, azimuth, angle, the, combined, effects, of, all, of, the, factors, mentioned, contribute, to, the, flux, of, cosmic, rays, at, earth, s, surface, the, following, table, of, participial, frequencies, reach, the, planet, and, are, inferred, from, lower, energy, radiation, reaching, the, ground, in, the, past, it, was, believed, that, the, cosmic, ray, flux, remained, fairly, constant, over, time, however, recent, research, suggests, one, and, a, half, to, two, fold, millennium, timescale, changes, in, the, cosmic, ray, flux, in, the, past, forty, thousand, years, the, magnitude, of, the, energy, of, cosmic, ray, flux, in, interstellar, space, is, very, comparable, to, that, of, other, deep, space, energies, cosmic, ray, energy, density, averages, about, one, electron, volt, per, cubic, centimetre, of, interstellar, space, or, 1, ev, cm, 3, which, is, comparable, to, the, energy, density, of, visible, starlight, at, 0, 3, ev, cm, 3, the, galactic, magnetic, field, energy, density, assumed, 3, microgauss, which, is, 0, 25, ev, cm, 3, or, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, radiation, energy, density, at, 0, 25, ev, cm, 3, there, are, two, main, classes, of, detection, methods, first, the, direct, detection, of, the, primary, cosmic, rays, in, space, or, at, high, altitude, by, balloon, borne, instruments, second, the, indirect, detection, of, secondary, particle, i, e, extensive, air, showers, at, higher, energies, while, there, have, been, proposals, and, prototypes, for, space, and, balloon, borne, detection, of, air, showers, currently, operating, experiments, for, high, energy, cosmic, rays, are, ground, based, generally, direct, detection, is, more, accurate, than, indirect, detection, however, the, flux, of, cosmic, rays, decreases, with, energy, which, hampers, direct, detection, for, the, energy, range, above, 1, pev, both, direct, and, indirect, detection, are, realized, by, several, techniques, direct, detection, is, possible, by, all, kinds, of, particle, detectors, at, the, iss, on, satellites, or, high, altitude, balloons, however, there, are, constraints, in, weight, and, size, limiting, the, choices, of, detectors, an, example, for, the, direct, detection, technique, is, a, method, based, on, nuclear, tracks, developed, by, robert, fleischer, p, buford, price, and, robert, m, walker, for, use, in, high, altitude, balloons, in, this, method, sheets, of, clear, plastic, like, 0, 25, mm, lexan, polycarbonate, are, stacked, together, and, exposed, directly, to, cosmic, rays, in, space, or, high, altitude, the, nuclear, charge, causes, chemical, bond, breaking, or, ionization, in, the, plastic, at, the, top, of, the, plastic, stack, the, ionization, is, less, due, to, the, high, cosmic, ray, speed, as, the, cosmic, ray, speed, decreases, due, to, deceleration, in, the, stack, the, ionization, increases, along, the, path, the, resulting, plastic, sheets, are, etched, or, slowly, dissolved, in, warm, caustic, sodium, hydroxide, solution, that, removes, the, surface, material, at, a, slow, known, rate, the, caustic, sodium, hydroxide, dissolves, the, plastic, at, a, faster, rate, along, the, path, of, the, ionized, plastic, the, net, result, is, a, conical, etch, pit, in, the, plastic, the, etch, pits, are, measured, under, a, high, power, microscope, typically, 1600, oil, immersion, and, the, etch, rate, is, plotted, as, a, function, of, the, depth, in, the, stacked, plastic, this, technique, yields, a, unique, curve, for, each, atomic, nucleus, from, 1, to, 92, allowing, identification, of, both, the, charge, and, energy, of, the, cosmic, ray, that, traverses, the, plastic, stack, the, more, extensive, the, ionization, along, the, path, the, higher, the, charge, in, addition, to, its, uses, for, cosmic, ray, detection, the, technique, is, also, used, to, detect, nuclei, created, as, products, of, nuclear, fission, there, are, several, ground, based, methods, of, detecting, cosmic, rays, currently, in, use, which, can, be, divided, in, two, main, categories, the, detection, of, secondary, particles, forming, extensive, air, showers, eas, by, various, types, of, particle, detectors, and, the, detection, of, electromagnetic, radiation, emitted, by, eas, in, the, atmosphere, extensive, air, shower, arrays, made, of, particle, detectors, measure, the, charged, particles, which, pass, through, them, eas, arrays, can, observe, a, broad, area, of, the, sky, and, can, be, active, more, than, 90, of, the, time, however, they, are, less, able, to, segregate, background, effects, from, cosmic, rays, than, can, air, cherenkov, telescopes, most, state, of, the, art, eas, arrays, employ, plastic, scintillators, also, water, liquid, or, frozen, is, used, as, a, detection, medium, through, which, particles, pass, and, produce, cherenkov, radiation, to, make, them, detectable, therefore, several, arrays, use, water, ice, cherenkov, detectors, as, alternative, or, in, addition, to, scintillators, by, the, combination, of, several, detectors, some, eas, arrays, have, the, capability, to, distinguish, muons, from, lighter, secondary, particles, photons, electrons, positrons, the, fraction, of, muons, among, the, secondary, particles, is, one, traditional, way, to, estimate, the, mass, composition, of, the, primary, cosmic, rays, an, historic, method, of, secondary, particle, detection, still, used, for, demonstration, purposes, involves, the, use, of, cloud, chambers, to, detect, the, secondary, muons, created, when, a, pion, decays, cloud, chambers, in, particular, can, be, built, from, widely, available, materials, and, can, be, constructed, even, in, a, high, school, laboratory, a, fifth, method, involving, bubble, chambers, can, be, used, to, detect, cosmic, ray, particles, more, recently, the, cmos, devices, in, pervasive, smartphone, cameras, have, been, proposed, as, a, practical, distributed, network, to, detect, air, showers, from, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, the, first, app, to, exploit, this, proposition, was, the, crayfis, cosmic, rays, found, in, smartphones, experiment, in, 2017, the, credo, cosmic, ray, extremely, distributed, observatory, collaboration, released, the, first, version, of, its, completely, open, source, app, for, android, devices, since, then, the, collaboration, has, attracted, the, interest, and, support, of, many, scientific, institutions, educational, institutions, and, members, of, the, public, around, the, world, future, research, has, to, show, in, what, aspects, this, new, technique, can, compete, with, dedicated, eas, arrays, the, first, detection, method, in, the, second, category, is, called, the, air, cherenkov, telescope, designed, to, detect, low, energy, 200, gev, cosmic, rays, by, means, of, analyzing, their, cherenkov, radiation, which, for, cosmic, rays, are, gamma, rays, emitted, as, they, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, their, medium, the, atmosphere, while, these, telescopes, are, extremely, good, at, distinguishing, between, background, radiation, and, that, of, cosmic, ray, origin, they, can, only, function, well, on, clear, nights, without, the, moon, shining, have, very, small, fields, of, view, and, are, only, active, for, a, few, percent, of, the, time, a, second, method, detects, the, light, from, nitrogen, fluorescence, caused, by, the, excitation, of, nitrogen, in, the, atmosphere, by, particles, moving, through, the, atmosphere, this, method, is, the, most, accurate, for, cosmic, rays, at, highest, energies, in, particular, when, combined, with, eas, arrays, of, particle, detectors, similar, to, the, detection, of, cherenkov, light, this, method, is, restricted, to, clear, nights, another, method, detects, radio, waves, emitted, by, air, showers, this, technique, has, a, high, duty, cycle, similar, to, that, of, particle, detectors, the, accuracy, of, this, technique, was, improved, in, the, last, years, as, shown, by, various, prototype, experiments, and, may, become, an, alternative, to, the, detection, of, atmospheric, cherenkov, light, and, fluorescence, light, at, least, at, high, energies, cosmic, rays, ionize, nitrogen, and, oxygen, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, which, leads, to, a, number, of, chemical, reactions, cosmic, rays, are, also, responsible, for, the, continuous, production, of, a, number, of, unstable, isotopes, such, as, carbon, 14, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, through, the, reaction, cosmic, rays, kept, the, level, of, carbon, 14, in, the, atmosphere, roughly, constant, 70, tons, for, at, least, the, past, 100, 000, years, until, the, beginning, of, above, ground, nuclear, weapons, testing, in, the, early, 1950s, this, fact, is, used, in, radiocarbon, dating, cosmic, rays, constitute, a, fraction, of, the, annual, radiation, exposure, of, human, beings, on, the, earth, averaging, 0, 39, msv, out, of, a, total, of, 3, msv, per, year, 13, of, total, background, for, the, earth, s, population, however, the, background, radiation, from, cosmic, rays, increases, with, altitude, from, 0, 3, msv, per, year, for, sea, level, areas, to, 1, 0, msv, per, year, for, higher, altitude, cities, raising, cosmic, radiation, exposure, to, a, quarter, of, total, background, radiation, exposure, for, populations, of, said, cities, airline, crews, flying, long, distance, high, altitude, routes, can, be, exposed, to, 2, 2, msv, of, extra, radiation, each, year, due, to, cosmic, rays, nearly, doubling, their, total, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, figures, are, for, the, time, before, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, disaster, human, made, values, by, unscear, are, from, the, japanese, national, institute, of, radiological, sciences, which, summarized, the, unscear, data, cosmic, rays, have, sufficient, energy, to, alter, the, states, of, circuit, components, in, electronic, integrated, circuits, causing, transient, errors, to, occur, such, as, corrupted, data, in, electronic, memory, devices, or, incorrect, performance, of, cpus, often, referred, to, as, soft, errors, this, has, been, a, problem, in, electronics, at, extremely, high, altitude, such, as, in, satellites, but, with, transistors, becoming, smaller, and, smaller, this, is, becoming, an, increasing, concern, in, ground, level, electronics, as, well, studies, by, ibm, in, the, 1990s, suggest, that, computers, typically, experience, about, one, cosmic, ray, induced, error, per, 256, megabytes, of, ram, per, month, to, alleviate, this, problem, the, intel, corporation, has, proposed, a, cosmic, ray, detector, that, could, be, integrated, into, future, high, density, microprocessors, allowing, the, processor, to, repeat, the, last, command, following, a, cosmic, ray, event, ecc, memory, is, used, to, protect, data, against, data, corruption, caused, by, cosmic, rays, in, 2008, data, corruption, in, a, flight, control, system, caused, an, airbus, a330, airliner, to, twice, plunge, hundreds, of, feet, resulting, in, injuries, to, multiple, passengers, and, crew, members, cosmic, rays, were, investigated, among, other, possible, causes, of, the, data, corruption, but, were, ultimately, ruled, out, as, being, very, unlikely, in, august, 2020, scientists, reported, that, ionizing, radiation, from, environmental, radioactive, materials, and, cosmic, rays, may, substantially, limit, the, coherence, times, of, qubits, if, they, are, not, shielded, adequately, which, may, be, critical, for, realizing, fault, tolerant, superconducting, quantum, computers, in, the, future, galactic, cosmic, rays, are, one, of, the, most, important, barriers, standing, in, the, way, of, plans, for, interplanetary, travel, by, crewed, spacecraft, cosmic, rays, also, pose, a, threat, to, electronics, placed, aboard, outgoing, probes, in, 2010, a, malfunction, aboard, the, voyager, 2, space, probe, was, credited, to, a, single, flipped, bit, probably, caused, by, a, cosmic, ray, strategies, such, as, physical, or, magnetic, shielding, for, spacecraft, have, been, considered, in, order, to, minimize, the, damage, to, electronics, and, human, beings, caused, by, cosmic, rays, on, 31, may, 2013, nasa, scientists, reported, that, a, possible, crewed, mission, to, mars, may, involve, a, greater, radiation, risk, than, previously, believed, based, on, the, amount, of, energetic, particle, radiation, detected, by, the, rad, on, the, mars, science, laboratory, while, traveling, from, the, earth, to, mars, in, 2011, 2012, flying, 12, kilometres, 39, 000, ft, high, passengers, and, crews, of, jet, airliners, are, exposed, to, at, least, 10, times, the, cosmic, ray, dose, that, people, at, sea, level, receive, aircraft, flying, polar, routes, near, the, geomagnetic, poles, are, at, particular, risk, cosmic, rays, have, been, implicated, in, the, triggering, of, electrical, breakdown, in, lightning, it, has, been, proposed, that, essentially, all, lightning, is, triggered, through, a, relativistic, process, or, runaway, breakdown, seeded, by, cosmic, ray, secondaries, subsequent, development, of, the, lightning, discharge, then, occurs, through, conventional, breakdown, mechanisms, a, role, for, cosmic, rays, in, climate, was, suggested, by, edward, p, ney, in, 1959, and, by, robert, e, dickinson, in, 1975, it, has, been, postulated, that, cosmic, rays, may, have, been, responsible, for, major, climatic, change, and, mass, extinction, in, the, past, according, to, adrian, mellott, and, mikhail, medvedev, 62, million, year, cycles, in, biological, marine, populations, correlate, with, the, motion, of, the, earth, relative, to, the, galactic, plane, and, increases, in, exposure, to, cosmic, rays, the, researchers, suggest, that, this, and, gamma, ray, bombardments, deriving, from, local, supernovae, could, have, affected, cancer, and, mutation, rates, and, might, be, linked, to, decisive, alterations, in, the, earth, s, climate, and, to, the, mass, extinctions, of, the, ordovician, danish, physicist, henrik, svensmark, has, controversially, argued, that, because, solar, variation, modulates, the, cosmic, ray, flux, on, earth, it, would, consequently, affect, the, rate, of, cloud, formation, and, hence, be, an, indirect, cause, of, global, warming, svensmark, is, one, of, several, scientists, outspokenly, opposed, to, the, mainstream, scientific, assessment, of, global, warming, leading, to, concerns, that, the, proposition, that, cosmic, rays, are, connected, to, global, warming, could, be, ideologically, biased, rather, than, scientifically, based, other, scientists, have, vigorously, criticized, svensmark, for, sloppy, and, inconsistent, work, one, example, is, adjustment, of, cloud, data, that, understates, error, in, lower, cloud, data, but, not, in, high, cloud, data, another, example, is, incorrect, handling, of, the, physical, data, resulting, in, graphs, that, do, not, show, the, correlations, they, claim, to, show, despite, svensmark, s, assertions, galactic, cosmic, rays, have, shown, no, statistically, significant, influence, on, changes, in, cloud, cover, and, have, been, demonstrated, in, studies, to, have, no, causal, relationship, to, changes, in, global, temperature, a, handful, of, studies, conclude, that, a, nearby, supernova, or, series, of, supernovas, caused, the, pliocene, marine, megafauna, extinction, event, by, substantially, increasing, radiation, levels, to, hazardous, amounts, for, large, seafaring, animals, there, are, a, number, of, cosmic, ray, research, initiatives, listed, below
