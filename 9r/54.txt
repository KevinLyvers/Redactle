the, radian, denoted, by, the, symbol, rad, is, the, unit, of, angle, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, and, is, the, standard, unit, of, angular, measure, used, in, many, areas, of, mathematics, it, is, defined, such, that, one, radian, is, the, angle, subtended, at, the, centre, of, a, circle, by, an, arc, that, is, equal, in, length, to, the, radius, the, unit, was, formerly, an, si, supplementary, unit, and, is, currently, a, dimensionless, si, derived, unit, defined, in, the, si, as, 1, rad, 1, and, expressed, in, terms, of, the, si, base, unit, metre, m, as, rad, m, m, angles, without, explicitly, specified, units, are, generally, assumed, to, be, measured, in, radians, especially, in, mathematical, writing, one, radian, is, defined, as, the, angle, subtended, from, the, center, of, a, circle, which, intercepts, an, arc, equal, in, length, to, the, radius, of, the, circle, more, generally, the, magnitude, in, radians, of, a, subtended, angle, is, equal, to, the, ratio, of, the, arc, length, to, the, radius, of, the, circle, that, is, s, r, displaystyle, theta, frac, s, r, where, is, the, magnitude, of, the, subtended, angle, in, radians, angle, rad, s, is, arc, length, and, r, is, radius, a, right, angle, is, exactly, 2, displaystyle, frac, pi, 2, radians, in, the, si, and, most, areas, of, mathematics, and, science, what, is, called, angle, is, actually, the, numerical, value, of, the, angle, when, the, angle, is, expressed, in, radians, angle, rad, the, si, radian, is, thus, the, numerical, value, of, one, radian, when, expressed, in, radians, hence, the, si, rad, 1, rad, rad, 1, this, has, caused, some, confusion, the, numerical, value, of, the, rotation, angle, when, expressed, in, radians, i, e, 360, rad, corresponding, to, one, complete, revolution, is, the, length, of, the, circumference, divided, by, the, radius, which, is, 2, r, r, displaystyle, frac, 2, pi, r, r, or, 2, thus, 2, radians, is, equal, to, 360, degrees, the, relation, 2, rad, 360, can, be, derived, using, the, formula, for, arc, length, arc, 2, r, 360, textstyle, ell, text, arc, 2, pi, r, left, tfrac, theta, 360, circ, right, since, radian, is, the, measure, of, an, angle, that, is, subtended, by, an, arc, of, a, length, equal, to, the, radius, of, the, circle, 1, 2, 1, rad, 360, textstyle, 1, 2, pi, left, tfrac, 1, text, rad, 360, circ, right, this, can, be, further, simplified, to, 1, 2, rad, 360, textstyle, 1, tfrac, 2, pi, text, rad, 360, circ, multiplying, both, sides, by, 360, gives, 360, 2, rad, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, and, international, organization, for, standardization, specify, rad, as, the, symbol, for, the, radian, alternative, symbols, that, were, in, use, in, 1909, are, c, the, superscript, letter, c, for, circular, measure, the, letter, r, or, a, superscript, r, but, these, variants, are, infrequently, used, as, they, may, be, mistaken, for, a, degree, symbol, or, a, radius, r, hence, an, angle, of, 1, 2, radians, would, be, written, today, as, 1, 2, rad, archaic, notations, could, include, 1, 2, r, 1, 2, rad, 1, 2, c, or, 1, 2, r, in, mathematical, writing, the, symbol, rad, is, often, omitted, when, quantifying, an, angle, in, the, absence, of, any, symbol, radians, are, assumed, and, when, degrees, are, meant, the, degree, sign, is, used, plane, angle, may, be, defined, as, s, r, where, is, the, numerical, value, of, the, subtended, angle, in, radians, s, is, arc, length, and, r, is, radius, one, si, radian, corresponds, to, the, numerical, value, of, the, angle, expressed, in, radians, for, which, s, r, hence, 1, si, radian, 1, m, m, 1, however, rad, is, only, to, be, used, to, express, angles, not, to, express, ratios, of, lengths, in, general, a, similar, calculation, using, the, area, of, a, circular, sector, 2, a, r, 2, gives, 1, si, radian, as, 1, m, 2, m, 2, 1, the, key, fact, is, that, the, si, radian, is, a, dimensionless, unit, equal, to, 1, in, si, 2019, the, si, radian, is, defined, accordingly, as, 1, rad, 1, it, is, a, long, established, practice, in, mathematics, and, across, all, areas, of, science, to, make, use, of, rad, 1, giacomo, prando, writes, the, current, state, of, affairs, leads, inevitably, to, ghostly, appearances, and, disappearances, of, the, radian, in, the, dimensional, analysis, of, physical, equations, for, example, an, object, hanging, by, a, string, from, a, pulley, will, rise, or, drop, by, y, r, centimeters, where, r, is, the, numerical, value, of, the, radius, of, the, pulley, when, expressed, in, centimeters, and, is, the, numerical, value, of, the, angle, through, which, the, pulley, turns, when, expressed, in, radians, when, multiplying, r, by, the, unit, radian, does, not, appear, in, the, result, similarly, in, the, formula, for, the, angular, velocity, of, a, rolling, wheel, v, r, radians, appear, in, the, units, of, but, not, on, the, right, hand, side, anthony, french, calls, this, phenomenon, a, perennial, problem, in, the, teaching, of, mechanics, oberhofer, says, that, the, typical, advice, of, ignoring, radians, during, dimensional, analysis, and, adding, or, removing, radians, in, units, according, to, convention, and, contextual, knowledge, is, pedagogically, unsatisfying, in, 1993, the, american, association, of, physics, teachers, metric, committee, specified, that, the, radian, should, explicitly, appear, in, quantities, only, when, different, numerical, values, would, be, obtained, when, other, angle, measures, were, used, such, as, in, the, quantities, of, angle, measure, rad, angular, speed, rad, s, angular, acceleration, rad, s, 2, and, torsional, stiffness, n, m, rad, and, not, in, the, quantities, of, torque, n, m, and, angular, momentum, kg, m, 2, s, at, least, a, dozen, scientists, between, 1936, and, 2022, have, made, proposals, to, treat, the, radian, as, a, base, unit, of, measurement, for, a, base, quantity, and, dimension, of, plane, angle, quincey, s, review, of, proposals, outlines, two, classes, of, proposal, the, first, option, changes, the, unit, of, a, radius, to, meters, per, radian, but, this, is, incompatible, with, dimensional, analysis, for, the, area, of, a, circle, r, 2, the, other, option, is, to, introduce, a, dimensional, constant, according, to, quincey, this, approach, is, logically, rigorous, compared, to, si, but, requires, the, modification, of, many, familiar, mathematical, and, physical, equations, a, dimensional, constant, for, angle, is, rather, strange, and, the, difficulty, of, modifying, equations, to, add, the, dimensional, constant, is, likely, to, preclude, widespread, use, in, particular, quincey, identifies, torrens, proposal, to, introduce, a, constant, equal, to, 1, inverse, radian, 1, rad, 1, in, a, fashion, similar, to, the, introduction, of, the, constant, 0, with, this, change, the, formula, for, the, angle, subtended, at, the, center, of, a, circle, s, r, is, modified, to, become, s, r, and, the, taylor, series, for, the, sine, of, an, angle, becomes, sin, sin, x, x, x, 3, 3, x, 5, 5, x, 7, 7, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, displaystyle, operatorname, sin, theta, sin, x, x, frac, x, 3, 3, frac, x, 5, 5, frac, x, 7, 7, cdots, eta, theta, frac, eta, theta, 3, 3, frac, eta, theta, 5, 5, frac, eta, theta, 7, 7, cdots, where, x, rad, displaystyle, x, eta, theta, theta, text, rad, is, the, numerical, value, of, the, angle, when, expressed, in, radians, the, capitalized, function, sin, is, the, complete, function, that, takes, an, argument, with, a, dimension, of, angle, and, is, independent, of, the, units, expressed, while, sin, is, the, traditional, function, on, pure, numbers, which, assumes, its, argument, is, a, dimensionless, number, in, radians, the, capitalised, symbol, sin, displaystyle, operatorname, sin, can, be, denoted, sin, displaystyle, sin, if, it, is, clear, that, the, complete, form, is, meant, current, si, can, be, considered, relative, to, this, framework, as, a, natural, unit, system, where, the, equation, 1, is, assumed, to, hold, or, similarly, 1, rad, 1, this, radian, convention, allows, the, omission, of, in, mathematical, formulas, defining, radian, as, a, base, unit, may, be, useful, for, software, where, the, disadvantage, of, longer, equations, is, minimal, for, example, the, boost, units, library, defines, angle, units, with, a, plane, angle, dimension, and, mathematica, s, unit, system, similarly, considers, angles, to, have, an, angle, dimension, as, stated, one, radian, is, equal, to, 180, displaystyle, 180, circ, pi, thus, to, convert, from, radians, to, degrees, multiply, magnitude, in, radians, by, 180, displaystyle, 180, circ, pi, for, example, conversely, to, convert, from, degrees, to, radians, multiply, magnitude, in, degrees, by, 180, rad, displaystyle, pi, 180, text, rad, for, example, 23, 23, 180, rad, 0, 4014, rad, displaystyle, 23, circ, 23, cdot, frac, pi, 180, text, rad, approx, 0, 4014, text, rad, radians, can, be, converted, to, turns, one, turn, is, the, angle, corresponding, to, a, revolution, by, dividing, the, number, of, radians, by, 2, one, revolution, is, 2, displaystyle, 2, pi, radians, which, equals, one, turn, which, is, by, definition, 400, gradians, 400, gons, or, 400, g, to, convert, from, radians, to, gradians, multiply, the, magnitude, of, the, angle, in, radians, by, 200, g, displaystyle, 200, text, g, pi, and, to, convert, from, gradians, to, radians, multiply, the, magnitude, of, the, angle, in, gradians, by, 200, rad, displaystyle, pi, 200, text, rad, for, example, in, calculus, and, most, other, branches, of, mathematics, beyond, practical, geometry, angles, are, measured, in, radians, this, is, because, radians, have, a, mathematical, naturalness, that, leads, to, a, more, elegant, formulation, of, some, important, results, results, in, analysis, involving, trigonometric, functions, can, be, elegantly, stated, when, the, functions, arguments, are, expressed, in, radians, for, example, the, use, of, radians, leads, to, the, simple, limit, formula, which, is, the, basis, of, many, other, identities, in, mathematics, including, because, of, these, and, other, properties, the, trigonometric, functions, appear, in, solutions, to, mathematical, problems, that, are, not, obviously, related, to, the, functions, geometrical, meanings, for, example, the, solutions, to, the, differential, equation, d, 2, y, d, x, 2, y, displaystyle, tfrac, d, 2, y, dx, 2, y, the, evaluation, of, the, integral, d, x, 1, x, 2, displaystyle, textstyle, int, frac, dx, 1, x, 2, and, so, on, in, all, such, cases, it, is, appropriate, that, the, arguments, of, the, functions, are, treated, as, dimensionless, numbers, without, any, reference, to, angles, the, trigonometric, functions, of, angles, also, have, simple, and, elegant, series, expansions, when, radians, are, used, for, example, when, x, is, the, numerical, value, of, an, angle, when, the, angle, is, expressed, in, radians, i, e, x, angle, rad, the, taylor, series, for, sin, x, becomes, if, x, were, the, numerical, value, of, the, angle, when, expressed, in, degrees, i, e, the, number, of, degrees, then, the, series, would, contain, messy, factors, involving, powers, of, 180, if, x, is, the, number, of, degrees, angle, degree, the, number, of, radians, angle, radian, is, y, x, 180, so, in, a, similar, spirit, if, angles, are, involved, mathematically, important, relationships, between, the, sine, and, cosine, functions, and, the, exponential, function, see, for, example, euler, s, formula, can, be, elegantly, stated, when, the, functions, arguments, are, magnitudes, of, angles, expressed, in, radians, and, messy, otherwise, more, generally, in, complex, number, theory, the, arguments, of, these, functions, are, dimensionless, possibly, complex, numbers, without, any, reference, to, physical, angles, at, all, the, radian, is, widely, used, in, physics, when, angular, measurements, are, required, for, example, angular, velocity, is, typically, expressed, in, the, unit, radian, per, second, rad, s, one, revolution, per, second, corresponds, to, 2, radians, per, second, similarly, the, unit, used, for, angular, acceleration, is, often, radian, per, second, per, second, rad, s, 2, for, the, purpose, of, dimensional, analysis, the, units, of, angular, velocity, and, angular, acceleration, are, s, 1, and, s, 2, respectively, likewise, the, phase, angle, difference, of, two, waves, can, also, be, expressed, using, the, radian, as, the, unit, for, example, if, the, phase, angle, difference, of, two, waves, is, n, 2, radians, where, n, is, an, integer, they, are, considered, to, be, in, phase, whilst, if, the, phase, angle, difference, of, two, waves, is, n, 2, radians, with, n, an, integer, they, are, considered, to, be, in, antiphase, a, unit, of, reciprocal, radian, or, inverse, radian, rad, 1, is, involved, in, derived, units, such, as, meter, per, radian, for, angular, wavelength, or, newton, metre, per, radian, for, torsional, stiffness, metric, prefixes, for, submultiples, are, used, with, radians, a, milliradian, mrad, is, a, thousandth, of, a, radian, 0, 001, rad, i, e, 1, rad, 10, 3, mrad, there, are, 2, 1000, milliradians, 6283, 185, mrad, in, a, circle, so, a, milliradian, is, just, under, 1, 6283, of, the, angle, subtended, by, a, full, circle, this, unit, of, angular, measurement, of, a, circle, is, in, common, use, by, telescopic, sight, manufacturers, using, stadiametric, rangefinding, in, reticles, the, divergence, of, laser, beams, is, also, usually, measured, in, milliradians, the, angular, mil, is, an, approximation, of, the, milliradian, used, by, nato, and, other, military, organizations, in, gunnery, and, targeting, each, angular, mil, represents, 1, 6400, of, a, circle, and, is, 15, 8, or, 1, 875, smaller, than, the, milliradian, for, the, small, angles, typically, found, in, targeting, work, the, convenience, of, using, the, number, 6400, in, calculation, outweighs, the, small, mathematical, errors, it, introduces, in, the, past, other, gunnery, systems, have, used, different, approximations, to, 1, 2000, for, example, sweden, used, the, 1, 6300, streck, and, the, ussr, used, 1, 6000, being, based, on, the, milliradian, the, nato, mil, subtends, roughly, 1, m, at, a, range, of, 1000, m, at, such, small, angles, the, curvature, is, negligible, prefixes, smaller, than, milli, are, useful, in, measuring, extremely, small, angles, microradians, rad, 10, 6, rad, and, nanoradians, nrad, 10, 9, rad, are, used, in, astronomy, and, can, also, be, used, to, measure, the, beam, quality, of, lasers, with, ultra, low, divergence, more, common, is, the, arc, second, which, is, 648, 000, rad, around, 4, 8481, microradians, the, idea, of, measuring, angles, by, the, length, of, the, arc, was, in, use, by, mathematicians, quite, early, for, example, al, kashi, c, 1400, used, so, called, diameter, parts, as, units, where, one, diameter, part, was, 1, 60, radian, they, also, used, sexagesimal, subunits, of, the, diameter, part, newton, in, 1672, spoke, of, the, angular, quantity, of, a, body, s, circular, motion, but, used, it, only, as, a, relative, measure, to, develop, an, astronomical, algorithm, the, concept, of, the, radian, measure, is, normally, credited, to, roger, cotes, who, died, in, 1716, by, 1722, his, cousin, robert, smith, had, collected, and, published, cotes, mathematical, writings, in, a, book, harmonia, mensurarum, in, a, chapter, of, editorial, comments, smith, gave, what, is, probably, the, first, published, calculation, of, one, radian, in, degrees, citing, a, note, of, cotes, that, has, not, survived, smith, described, the, radian, in, everything, but, name, now, this, number, is, equal, to, 180, degrees, as, the, radius, of, a, circle, to, the, semicircumference, this, is, as, 1, to, 3, 141592653589, and, recognized, its, naturalness, as, a, unit, of, angular, measure, in, 1765, leonhard, euler, implicitly, adopted, the, radian, as, a, unit, of, angle, specifically, euler, defined, angular, velocity, as, the, angular, speed, in, rotational, motion, is, the, speed, of, that, point, the, distance, of, which, from, the, axis, of, gyration, is, expressed, by, one, euler, was, probably, the, first, to, adopt, this, convention, referred, to, as, the, radian, convention, which, gives, the, simple, formula, for, angular, velocity, v, r, as, discussed, in, dimensional, analysis, the, radian, convention, has, been, widely, adopted, while, dimensionally, consistent, formulations, require, the, insertion, of, a, dimensional, constant, for, example, v, r, prior, to, the, term, radian, becoming, widespread, the, unit, was, commonly, called, circular, measure, of, an, angle, the, term, radian, first, appeared, in, print, on, 5, june, 1873, in, examination, questions, set, by, james, thomson, brother, of, lord, kelvin, at, queen, s, college, belfast, he, had, used, the, term, as, early, as, 1871, while, in, 1869, thomas, muir, then, of, the, university, of, st, andrews, vacillated, between, the, terms, rad, radial, and, radian, in, 1874, after, a, consultation, with, james, thomson, muir, adopted, radian, the, name, radian, was, not, universally, adopted, for, some, time, after, this, longmans, school, trigonometry, still, called, the, radian, circular, measure, when, published, in, 1890, in, 1893, alexander, macfarlane, wrote, the, true, analytical, argument, for, the, circular, ratios, is, not, the, ratio, of, the, arc, to, the, radius, but, the, ratio, of, twice, the, area, of, a, sector, to, the, square, on, the, radius, for, some, reason, the, paper, was, withdrawn, from, the, published, proceedings, of, mathematical, congress, held, in, connection, with, world, s, columbian, exposition, in, chicago, acknowledged, at, page, 167, and, privately, published, in, his, papers, on, space, analysis, 1894, macfarlane, reached, this, idea, or, ratios, of, areas, while, considering, the, basis, for, hyperbolic, angle, which, is, analogously, defined, as, paul, quincey, et, al, writes, the, status, of, angles, within, the, international, system, of, units, si, has, long, been, a, source, of, controversy, and, confusion, in, 1960, the, cgpm, established, the, si, and, the, radian, was, classified, as, a, supplementary, unit, along, with, the, steradian, this, special, class, was, officially, regarded, either, as, base, units, or, as, derived, units, as, the, cgpm, could, not, reach, a, decision, on, whether, the, radian, was, a, base, unit, or, a, derived, unit, richard, nelson, writes, this, ambiguity, prompted, a, spirited, discussion, over, their, proper, interpretation, in, may, 1980, the, consultative, committee, for, units, ccu, considered, a, proposal, for, making, radians, an, si, base, unit, using, a, constant, 0, 1, rad, but, turned, it, down, to, avoid, an, upheaval, to, current, practice, in, october, 1980, the, cgpm, decided, that, supplementary, units, were, dimensionless, derived, units, for, which, the, cgpm, allowed, the, freedom, of, using, them, or, not, using, them, in, expressions, for, si, derived, units, on, the, basis, that, exists, which, is, at, the, same, time, coherent, and, convenient, and, in, which, the, quantities, plane, angle, and, solid, angle, might, be, considered, as, base, quantities, and, that, compromises, the, internal, coherence, of, the, si, based, on, only, seven, base, units, in, 1995, the, cgpm, eliminated, the, class, of, supplementary, units, and, defined, the, radian, and, the, steradian, as, dimensionless, derived, units, the, names, and, symbols, of, which, may, but, need, not, be, used, in, expressions, for, other, si, derived, units, as, is, convenient, mikhail, kalinin, writing, in, 2019, has, criticized, the, 1980, cgpm, decision, as, unfounded, and, says, that, the, 1995, cgpm, decision, used, inconsistent, arguments, and, introduced, numerous, discrepancies, inconsistencies, and, contradictions, in, the, wordings, of, the, si, at, the, 2013, meeting, of, the, ccu, peter, mohr, gave, a, presentation, on, alleged, inconsistencies, arising, from, defining, the, radian, as, a, dimensionless, unit, rather, than, a, base, unit, ccu, president, ian, m, mills, declared, this, to, be, a, formidable, problem, and, the, ccu, working, group, on, angles, and, dimensionless, quantities, in, the, si, was, established, the, ccu, met, in, 2021, but, did, not, reach, a, consensus, a, small, number, of, members, argued, strongly, that, the, radian, should, be, a, base, unit, but, the, majority, felt, the, status, quo, was, acceptable, or, that, the, change, would, cause, more, problems, than, it, would, solve, a, task, group, was, established, to, review, the, historical, use, of, si, supplementary, units, and, consider, whether, reintroduction, would, be, of, benefit, among, other, activities
