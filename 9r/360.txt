phosphorus, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, p, and, atomic, number, 15, elemental, phosphorus, exists, in, two, major, forms, white, phosphorus, and, red, phosphorus, but, because, it, is, highly, reactive, phosphorus, is, never, found, as, a, free, element, on, earth, it, has, a, concentration, in, the, earth, s, crust, of, about, one, gram, per, kilogram, compare, copper, at, about, 0, 06, grams, in, minerals, phosphorus, generally, occurs, as, phosphate, elemental, phosphorus, was, first, isolated, as, white, phosphorus, in, 1669, in, white, phosphorus, phosphorus, atoms, are, arranged, in, groups, of, 4, written, as, p, 4, white, phosphorus, emits, a, faint, glow, when, exposed, to, oxygen, hence, a, name, taken, from, greek, mythology, meaning, light, bearer, latin, lucifer, referring, to, the, morning, star, the, planet, venus, the, term, phosphorescence, meaning, glow, after, illumination, has, its, origin, in, phosphorus, although, phosphorus, itself, does, not, exhibit, phosphorescence, phosphorus, glows, due, to, oxidation, of, the, white, but, not, red, phosphorus, a, process, now, called, chemiluminescence, phosphorus, is, classified, as, a, pnictogen, together, with, nitrogen, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and, moscovium, phosphorus, is, an, element, essential, to, sustaining, life, largely, through, phosphates, compounds, containing, the, phosphate, ion, po, 4, 3, phosphates, are, a, component, of, dna, rna, atp, and, phospholipids, complex, compounds, fundamental, to, cells, elemental, phosphorus, was, first, isolated, from, human, urine, and, bone, ash, was, an, important, early, phosphate, source, phosphate, mines, contain, fossils, because, phosphate, is, present, in, the, fossilized, deposits, of, animal, remains, and, excreta, low, phosphate, levels, are, an, important, limit, to, growth, in, a, number, of, plant, ecosystems, the, vast, majority, of, phosphorus, compounds, mined, are, consumed, as, fertilisers, phosphate, is, needed, to, replace, the, phosphorus, that, plants, remove, from, the, soil, and, its, annual, demand, is, rising, nearly, twice, as, fast, as, the, growth, of, the, human, population, other, applications, include, organophosphorus, compounds, in, detergents, pesticides, and, nerve, agents, phosphorus, has, several, allotropes, that, exhibit, strikingly, diverse, properties, the, two, most, common, allotropes, are, white, phosphorus, and, red, phosphorus, for, both, pure, and, applied, uses, the, most, important, allotrope, is, white, phosphorus, often, abbreviated, wp, white, phosphorus, is, a, soft, waxy, molecular, solid, composed, of, p, 4, tetrahedra, this, p, 4, tetrahedron, is, also, present, in, liquid, and, gaseous, phosphorus, up, to, the, temperature, of, 800, c, 1, 500, f, 1, 100, k, when, it, starts, decomposing, to, p, 2, molecules, the, nature, of, bonding, in, this, p, 4, tetrahedron, can, be, described, by, spherical, aromaticity, or, cluster, bonding, that, is, the, electrons, are, highly, delocalized, this, has, been, illustrated, by, calculations, of, the, magnetically, induced, currents, which, sum, up, to, 29, na, t, much, more, than, in, the, archetypical, aromatic, molecule, benzene, 11, na, t, white, phosphorus, exists, in, two, crystalline, forms, alpha, and, beta, at, room, temperature, the, form, is, stable, it, is, more, common, has, cubic, crystal, structure, and, at, 195, 2, k, 78, 0, c, it, transforms, into, form, which, has, hexagonal, crystal, structure, these, forms, differ, in, terms, of, the, relative, orientations, of, the, constituent, p, 4, tetrahedra, white, phosphorus, is, the, least, stable, the, most, reactive, the, most, volatile, the, least, dense, and, the, most, toxic, of, the, allotropes, white, phosphorus, gradually, changes, to, red, phosphorus, accelerated, by, light, and, heat, samples, of, white, phosphorus, almost, always, contain, some, red, phosphorus, and, accordingly, appear, yellow, for, this, reason, white, phosphorus, that, is, aged, or, otherwise, impure, e, g, weapons, grade, not, lab, grade, wp, is, also, called, yellow, phosphorus, white, phosphorus, is, highly, flammable, and, pyrophoric, self, igniting, in, air, it, faintly, glows, green, and, blue, in, the, dark, when, exposed, to, oxygen, the, autoxidation, commonly, coats, samples, with, white, phosphorus, pentoxide, p, 4, o, 10, p, 4, tetrahedra, but, with, oxygen, inserted, between, the, phosphorus, atoms, and, at, the, vertices, white, phosphorus, is, a, napalm, additive, and, the, characteristic, odour, of, combustion, is, garlicky, white, phosphorus, is, insoluble, in, water, but, soluble, in, carbon, disulfide, thermal, decomposition, of, p, 4, at, 1100, k, gives, diphosphorus, p, 2, this, species, is, not, stable, as, a, solid, or, liquid, the, dimeric, unit, contains, a, triple, bond, and, is, analogous, to, n, 2, it, can, also, be, generated, as, a, transient, intermediate, in, solution, by, thermolysis, of, organophosphorus, precursor, reagents, at, still, higher, temperatures, p, 2, dissociates, into, atomic, p, red, phosphorus, is, polymeric, in, structure, it, can, be, viewed, as, a, derivative, of, p, 4, wherein, one, p, p, bond, is, broken, and, one, additional, bond, is, formed, with, the, neighbouring, tetrahedron, resulting, in, chains, of, p, 21, molecules, linked, by, van, der, waals, forces, red, phosphorus, may, be, formed, by, heating, white, phosphorus, to, 250, c, 482, f, or, by, exposing, white, phosphorus, to, sunlight, phosphorus, after, this, treatment, is, amorphous, upon, further, heating, this, material, crystallises, in, this, sense, red, phosphorus, is, not, an, allotrope, but, rather, an, intermediate, phase, between, the, white, and, violet, phosphorus, and, most, of, its, properties, have, a, range, of, values, for, example, freshly, prepared, bright, red, phosphorus, is, highly, reactive, and, ignites, at, about, 300, c, 572, f, though, it, is, more, stable, than, white, phosphorus, which, ignites, at, about, 30, c, 86, f, after, prolonged, heating, or, storage, the, color, darkens, see, infobox, images, the, resulting, product, is, more, stable, and, does, not, spontaneously, ignite, in, air, violet, phosphorus, is, a, form, of, phosphorus, that, can, be, produced, by, day, long, annealing, of, red, phosphorus, above, 550, c, in, 1865, hittorf, discovered, that, when, phosphorus, was, recrystallised, from, molten, lead, a, red, purple, form, is, obtained, therefore, this, form, is, sometimes, known, as, hittorf, s, phosphorus, or, violet, or, metallic, phosphorus, black, phosphorus, is, the, least, reactive, allotrope, and, the, thermodynamically, stable, form, below, 550, c, 1, 022, f, it, is, also, known, as, metallic, phosphorus, and, has, a, structure, somewhat, resembling, that, of, graphite, it, is, obtained, by, heating, white, phosphorus, under, high, pressures, about, 12, 000, standard, atmospheres, or, 1, 2, gigapascals, it, can, also, be, produced, at, ambient, conditions, using, metal, salts, e, g, mercury, as, catalysts, in, appearance, properties, and, structure, it, resembles, graphite, being, black, and, flaky, a, conductor, of, electricity, and, has, puckered, sheets, of, linked, atoms, another, form, scarlet, phosphorus, is, obtained, by, allowing, a, solution, of, white, phosphorus, in, carbon, disulfide, to, evaporate, in, sunlight, when, first, isolated, it, was, observed, that, the, green, glow, emanating, from, white, phosphorus, would, persist, for, a, time, in, a, stoppered, jar, but, then, cease, robert, boyle, in, the, 1680s, ascribed, it, to, debilitation, of, the, air, in, fact, this, process, is, caused, by, the, phosphorus, reacting, with, oxygen, in, the, air, in, a, sealed, container, this, process, will, eventually, stop, when, all, the, oxygen, in, the, container, is, consumed, by, the, 18th, century, it, was, known, that, in, pure, oxygen, phosphorus, does, not, glow, at, all, there, is, only, a, range, of, partial, pressures, at, which, it, does, heat, can, be, applied, to, drive, the, reaction, at, higher, pressures, in, 1974, the, glow, was, explained, by, r, j, van, zee, and, a, u, khan, a, reaction, with, oxygen, takes, place, at, the, surface, of, the, solid, or, liquid, phosphorus, forming, the, short, lived, molecules, hpo, and, p, 2, o, 2, that, both, emit, visible, light, the, reaction, is, slow, and, only, very, little, of, the, intermediates, are, required, to, produce, the, luminescence, hence, the, extended, time, the, glow, continues, in, a, stoppered, jar, since, its, discovery, phosphors, and, phosphorescence, were, used, loosely, to, describe, substances, that, shine, in, the, dark, without, burning, although, the, term, phosphorescence, is, derived, from, phosphorus, the, reaction, that, gives, phosphorus, its, glow, is, properly, called, chemiluminescence, glowing, due, to, a, cold, chemical, reaction, not, phosphorescence, re, emitting, light, that, previously, fell, onto, a, substance, and, excited, it, there, are, 22, known, isotopes, of, phosphorus, ranging, from, 26, p, to, 47, p, only, 31, p, is, stable, and, is, therefore, present, at, 100, abundance, the, half, integer, nuclear, spin, and, high, abundance, of, 31, p, make, phosphorus, 31, nmr, spectroscopy, a, very, useful, analytical, tool, in, studies, of, phosphorus, containing, samples, two, radioactive, isotopes, of, phosphorus, have, half, lives, suitable, for, biological, scientific, experiments, these, are, the, high, energy, beta, particles, from, 32, p, penetrate, skin, and, corneas, and, any, 32, p, ingested, inhaled, or, absorbed, is, readily, incorporated, into, bone, and, nucleic, acids, for, these, reasons, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, in, the, united, states, and, similar, institutions, in, other, developed, countries, require, personnel, working, with, 32, p, to, wear, lab, coats, disposable, gloves, and, safety, glasses, or, goggles, to, protect, the, eyes, and, avoid, working, directly, over, open, containers, monitoring, personal, clothing, and, surface, contamination, is, also, required, shielding, requires, special, consideration, the, high, energy, of, the, beta, particles, gives, rise, to, secondary, emission, of, x, rays, via, bremsstrahlung, braking, radiation, in, dense, shielding, materials, such, as, lead, therefore, the, radiation, must, be, shielded, with, low, density, materials, such, as, acrylic, or, other, plastic, water, or, when, transparency, is, not, required, even, wood, in, 2013, astronomers, detected, phosphorus, in, cassiopeia, a, which, confirmed, that, this, element, is, produced, in, supernovae, as, a, byproduct, of, supernova, nucleosynthesis, the, phosphorus, to, iron, ratio, in, material, from, the, supernova, remnant, could, be, up, to, 100, times, higher, than, in, the, milky, way, in, general, in, 2020, astronomers, analysed, alma, and, rosina, data, from, the, massive, star, forming, region, afgl, 5142, to, detect, phosphorus, bearing, molecules, and, how, they, are, carried, in, comets, to, the, early, earth, phosphorus, has, a, concentration, in, the, earth, s, crust, of, about, one, gram, per, kilogram, compare, copper, at, about, 0, 06, grams, it, is, not, found, free, in, nature, but, is, widely, distributed, in, many, minerals, usually, as, phosphates, inorganic, phosphate, rock, which, is, partially, made, of, apatite, a, group, of, minerals, being, generally, pentacalcium, triorthophosphate, fluoride, hydroxide, is, today, the, chief, commercial, source, of, this, element, according, to, the, us, geological, survey, usgs, about, 50, percent, of, the, global, phosphorus, reserves, are, in, amazigh, nations, like, morocco, algeria, and, tunisia, 85, of, earth, s, known, reserves, are, in, morocco, with, smaller, deposits, in, china, russia, florida, idaho, tennessee, utah, and, elsewhere, albright, and, wilson, in, the, uk, and, their, niagara, falls, plant, for, instance, were, using, phosphate, rock, in, the, 1890s, and, 1900s, from, tennessee, florida, and, the, les, du, conn, table, guano, island, sources, of, phosphate, by, 1950, they, were, using, phosphate, rock, mainly, from, tennessee, and, north, africa, organic, sources, namely, urine, bone, ash, and, in, the, latter, 19th, century, guano, were, historically, of, importance, but, had, only, limited, commercial, success, as, urine, contains, phosphorus, it, has, fertilising, qualities, which, are, still, harnessed, today, in, some, countries, including, sweden, using, methods, for, reuse, of, excreta, to, this, end, urine, can, be, used, as, a, fertiliser, in, its, pure, form, or, part, of, being, mixed, with, water, in, the, form, of, sewage, or, sewage, sludge, the, most, prevalent, compounds, of, phosphorus, are, derivatives, of, phosphate, po, 4, 3, a, tetrahedral, anion, phosphate, is, the, conjugate, base, of, phosphoric, acid, which, is, produced, on, a, massive, scale, for, use, in, fertilisers, being, triprotic, phosphoric, acid, converts, stepwise, to, three, conjugate, bases, phosphate, exhibits, a, tendency, to, form, chains, and, rings, containing, p, o, p, bonds, many, polyphosphates, are, known, including, atp, polyphosphates, arise, by, dehydration, of, hydrogen, phosphates, such, as, hpo, 4, 2, and, h, 2, po, 4, for, example, the, industrially, important, pentasodium, triphosphate, also, known, as, sodium, tripolyphosphate, stpp, is, produced, industrially, by, the, megatonne, by, this, condensation, reaction, phosphorus, pentoxide, p, 4, o, 10, is, the, acid, anhydride, of, phosphoric, acid, but, several, intermediates, between, the, two, are, known, this, waxy, white, solid, reacts, vigorously, with, water, with, metal, cations, phosphate, forms, a, variety, of, salts, these, solids, are, polymeric, featuring, p, o, m, linkages, when, the, metal, cation, has, a, charge, of, 2, or, 3, the, salts, are, generally, insoluble, hence, they, exist, as, common, minerals, many, phosphate, salts, are, derived, from, hydrogen, phosphate, hpo, 4, 2, pcl, 5, and, pf, 5, are, common, compounds, pf, 5, is, a, colourless, gas, and, the, molecules, have, trigonal, bipyramidal, geometry, pcl, 5, is, a, colourless, solid, which, has, an, ionic, formulation, of, pcl, 4, pcl, 6, but, adopts, the, trigonal, bipyramidal, geometry, when, molten, or,

forms, pf, 6, an, anion, that, is, isoelectronic, with, sf, 6, the, most, important, oxyhalide, is, phosphorus, oxychloride, pocl, 3, which, is, approximately, tetrahedral, before, extensive, computer, calculations, were, feasible, it, was, thought, that, bonding, in, phosphorus, v, compounds, involved, d, orbitals, computer, modeling, of, molecular, orbital, theory, indicates, that, this, bonding, involves, only, s, and, p, orbitals, all, four, symmetrical, trihalides, are, well, known, gaseous, pf, 3, the, yellowish, liquids, pcl, 3, and, pbr, 3, and, the, solid, pi, 3, these, materials, are, moisture, sensitive, hydrolysing, to, give, phosphorous, acid, the, trichloride, a, common, reagent, is, produced, by, chlorination, of, white, phosphorus, the, trifluoride, is, produced, from, the, trichloride, by, halide, exchange, pf, 3, is, toxic, because, it, binds, to, haemoglobin, phosphorus, iii, oxide, p, 4, o, 6, also, called, tetraphosphorus, hexoxide, is, the, anhydride, of, p, oh, 3, the, minor, tautomer, of, phosphorous, acid, the, structure, of, p, 4, o, 6, is, like, that, of, p, 4, o, 10, without, the, terminal, oxide, groups, these, compounds, generally, feature, p, p, bonds, examples, include, catenated, derivatives, of, phosphine, and, organophosphines, compounds, containing, p, p, double, bonds, have, also, been, observed, although, they, are, rare, phosphides, arise, by, reaction, of, metals, with, red, phosphorus, the, alkali, metals, group, 1, and, alkaline, earth, metals, can, form, ionic, compounds, containing, the, phosphide, ion, p, 3, these, compounds, react, with, water, to, form, phosphine, other, phosphides, for, example, na, 3, p, 7, are, known, for, these, reactive, metals, with, the, transition, metals, as, well, as, the, monophosphides, there, are, metal, rich, phosphides, which, are, generally, hard, refractory, compounds, with, a, metallic, lustre, and, phosphorus, rich, phosphides, which, are, less, stable, and, include, semiconductors, schreibersite, is, a, naturally, occurring, metal, rich, phosphide, found, in, meteorites, the, structures, of, the, metal, rich, and, phosphorus, rich, phosphides, can, be, complex, phosphine, ph, 3, and, its, organic, derivatives, pr, 3, are, structural, analogues, of, ammonia, nh, 3, but, the, bond, angles, at, phosphorus, are, closer, to, 90, for, phosphine, and, its, organic, derivatives, phosphine, is, an, ill, smelling, toxic, gas, phosphorus, has, an, oxidation, number, of, 3, in, phosphine, phosphine, is, produced, by, hydrolysis, of, calcium, phosphide, ca, 3, p, 2, unlike, ammonia, phosphine, is, oxidised, by, air, phosphine, is, also, far, less, basic, than, ammonia, other, phosphines, are, known, which, contain, chains, of, up, to, nine, phosphorus, atoms, and, have, the, formula, p, n, h, n, 2, the, highly, flammable, gas, diphosphine, p, 2, h, 4, is, an, analogue, of, hydrazine, phosphorus, oxoacids, are, extensive, often, commercially, important, and, sometimes, structurally, complicated, they, all, have, acidic, protons, bound, to, oxygen, atoms, some, have, nonacidic, protons, that, are, bonded, directly, to, phosphorus, and, some, contain, phosphorus, phosphorus, bonds, although, many, oxoacids, of, phosphorus, are, formed, only, nine, are, commercially, important, and, three, of, them, hypophosphorous, acid, phosphorous, acid, and, phosphoric, acid, are, particularly, important, the, pn, molecule, is, considered, unstable, but, is, a, product, of, crystalline, phosphorus, nitride, decomposition, at, 1100, k, similarly, h, 2, pn, is, considered, unstable, and, phosphorus, nitride, halogens, like, f, 2, pn, cl, 2, pn, br, 2, pn, and, i, 2, pn, oligomerise, into, cyclic, polyphosphazenes, for, example, compounds, of, the, formula, pncl, 2, n, exist, mainly, as, rings, such, as, the, trimer, hexachlorophosphazene, the, phosphazenes, arise, by, treatment, of, phosphorus, pentachloride, with, ammonium, chloride, pcl, 5, nh, 4, cl, 1, n, npcl, 2, n, 4, hcl, when, the, chloride, groups, are, replaced, by, alkoxide, ro, a, family, of, polymers, is, produced, with, potentially, useful,

strike, anywhere, matches, p, 4, s, 10, and, p, 4, o, 10, have, analogous, structures, mixed, oxyhalides, and, oxyhydrides, of, phosphorus, iii, are, almost, unknown, compounds, with, p, c, and, p, o, c, bonds, are, often, classified, as, organophosphorus, compounds, they, are, widely, used, commercially, the, pcl, 3, serves, as, a, source, of, p, 3, in, routes, to, organophosphorus, iii, compounds, for, example, it, is, the, precursor, to, triphenylphosphine, treatment, of, phosphorus, trihalides, with, alcohols, and, phenols, gives, phosphites, e, g, triphenylphosphite, similar, reactions, occur, for, phosphorus, oxychloride, affording, triphenylphosphate, the, name, phosphorus, in, ancient, greece, was, the, name, for, the, planet, venus, and, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, light, carry, which, roughly, translates, as, light, bringer, or, light, carrier, in, greek, mythology, and, tradition, augerinus, morning, star, still, in, use, today, hesperus, or, hesperinus, or, or, evening, star, still, in, use, today, and, eosphorus, dawnbearer, not, in, use, for, the, planet, after, christianity, are, close, homologues, and, also, associated, with, phosphorus, the, morning, star, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, correct, spelling, of, the, element, is, phosphorus, the, word, phosphorous, is, the, adjectival, form, of, the, p, 3, valence, so, just, as, sulfur, forms, sulfurous, and, sulfuric, compounds, phosphorus, forms, phosphorous, compounds, e, g, phosphorous, acid, and, p, 5, valence, phosphoric, compounds, e, g, phosphoric, acids, and, phosphates, the, discovery, of, phosphorus, the, first, element, to, be, discovered, that, was, not, known, since, ancient, times, is, credited, to, the, german, alchemist, hennig, brand, in, 1669, although, others, might, have, discovered, phosphorus, around, the, same, time, brand, experimented, with, urine, which, contains, considerable, quantities, of, dissolved, phosphates, from, normal, metabolism, working, in, hamburg, brand, attempted, to, create, the, fabled, philosopher, s, stone, through, the, distillation, of, some, salts, by, evaporating, urine, and, in, the, process, produced, a, white, material, that, glowed, in, the, dark, and, burned, brilliantly, it, was, named, phosphorus, mirabilis, miraculous, bearer, of, light, brand, s, process, originally, involved, letting, urine, stand, for, days, until, it, gave, off, a, terrible, stench, then, he, boiled, it, down, to, a, paste, heated, this, paste, to, a, high, temperature, and, led, the, vapours, through, water, where, he, hoped, they, would, condense, to, gold, instead, he, obtained, a, white, waxy, substance, that, glowed, in, the, dark, brand, had, discovered, phosphorus, specifically, brand, produced, ammonium, sodium, hydrogen, phosphate, nh, 4, nahpo, 4, while, the, quantities, were, essentially, correct, it, took, about, 1, 100, litres, of, urine, to, make, about, 60, g, of, phosphorus, it, was, unnecessary, to, allow, the, urine, to, rot, first, later, scientists, discovered, that, fresh, urine, yielded, the, same, amount, of, phosphorus, brand, at, first, tried, to, keep, the, method, secret, but, later, sold, the, recipe, for, 200, thalers, to, johann, daniel, kraft, de, from, dresden, krafft, toured, much, of, europe, with, it, including, england, where, he, met, with, robert, boyle, the, secret, that, the, substance, was, made, from, urine, leaked, out, and, johann, kunckel, 1630, 1703, was, able, to, reproduce, it, in, sweden, 1678, later, boyle, in, london, 1680, also, managed, to, make, phosphorus, possibly, with, the, aid, of, his, assistant, ambrose, godfrey, hanckwitz, godfrey, later, made, a, business, of, the, manufacture, of, phosphorus, boyle, states, that, krafft, gave, him, no, information, as, to, the, preparation, of, phosphorus, other, than, that, it, was, derived, from, somewhat, that, belonged, to, the, body, of, man, this, gave, boyle, a, valuable, clue, so, that, he, too, managed, to, make, phosphorus, and, published, the, method, of, its, manufacture, later, he, improved, brand, s, process, by, using, sand, in, the, reaction, still, using, urine, as, base, material, robert, boyle, was, the, first, to, use, phosphorus, to, ignite, sulfur, tipped, wooden, splints, forerunners, of, our, modern, matches, in, 1680, phosphorus, was, the, 13th, element, to, be, discovered, because, of, its, tendency, to, spontaneously, combust, when, left, alone, in, air, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, devil, s, element, antoine, lavoisier, recognized, phosphorus, as, an, element, in, 1777, after, johan, gottlieb, gahn, and, carl, wilhelm, scheele, in, 1769, showed, that, calcium, phosphate, ca, 3, po, 4, 2, is, found, in, bones, by, obtaining, elemental, phosphorus, from, bone, ash, bone, ash, was, the, major, source, of, phosphorus, until, the, 1840s, the, method, started, by, roasting, bones, then, employed, the, use, of, fire, clay, retorts, encased, in, a, very, hot, brick, furnace, to, distill, out, the, highly, toxic, elemental, phosphorus, product, alternately, precipitated, phosphates, could, be, made, from, ground, up, bones, that, had, been, de, greased, and, treated, with, strong, acids, white, phosphorus, could, then, be, made, by, heating, the, precipitated, phosphates, mixed, with, ground, coal, or, charcoal, in, an, iron, pot, and, distilling, off, phosphorus, vapour, in, a, retort, carbon, monoxide, and, other, flammable, gases, produced, during, the, reduction, process, were, burnt, off, in, a, flare, stack, in, the, 1840s, world, phosphate, production, turned, to, the, mining, of, tropical, island, deposits, formed, from, bird, and, bat, guano, see, also, guano, islands, act, these, became, an, important, source, of, phosphates, for, fertiliser, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, phosphate, rock, which, usually, contains, calcium, phosphate, was, first, used, in, 1850, to, make, phosphorus, and, following, the, introduction, of, the, electric, arc, furnace, by, james, burgess, readman, in, 1888, patented, 1889, elemental, phosphorus, production, switched, from, the, bone, ash, heating, to, electric, arc, production, from, phosphate, rock, after, the, depletion, of, world, guano, sources, about, the, same, time, mineral, phosphates, became, the, major, source, of, phosphate, fertiliser, production, phosphate, rock, production, greatly, increased, after, world, war, ii, and, remains, the, primary, global, source, of, phosphorus, and, phosphorus, chemicals, today, phosphate, rock, remains, a, feedstock, in, the, fertiliser, industry, where, it, is, treated, with, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, various, superphosphate, fertiliser, products, white, phosphorus, was, first, made, commercially, in, the, 19th, century, for, the, match, industry, this, used, bone, ash, for, a, phosphate, source, as, described, above, the, bone, ash, process, became, obsolete, when, the, submerged, arc, furnace, for, phosphorus, production, was, introduced, to, reduce, phosphate, rock, the, electric, furnace, method, allowed, production, to, increase, to, the, point, where, phosphorus, could, be, used, in, weapons, of, war, in, world, war, i, it, was, used, in, incendiaries, smoke, screens, and, tracer, bullets, a, special, incendiary, bullet, was, developed, to, shoot, at, hydrogen, filled, zeppelins, over, britain, hydrogen, being, highly, flammable, during, world, war, ii, molotov, cocktails, made, of, phosphorus, dissolved, in, petrol, were, distributed, in, britain, to, specially, selected, civilians, within, the, british, resistance, operation, for, defence, and, phosphorus, incendiary, bombs, were, used, in, war, on, a, large, scale, burning, phosphorus, is, difficult, to, extinguish, and, if, it, splashes, onto, human, skin, it, has, horrific, effects, early, matches, used, white, phosphorus, in, their, composition, which, was, dangerous, due, to, its, toxicity, murders, suicides, and, accidental, poisonings, resulted, from, its, use, an, apocryphal, tale, tells, of, a, woman, attempting, to, murder, her, husband, with, white, phosphorus, in, his, food, which, was, detected, by, the, stew, s, giving, off, luminous, steam, in, addition, exposure, to, the, vapours, gave, match, workers, a, severe, necrosis, of, the, bones, of, the, jaw, known, as, phossy, jaw, when, a, safe, process, for, manufacturing, red, phosphorus, was, discovered, with, its, far, lower, flammability, and, toxicity, laws, were, enacted, under, the, berne, convention, 1906, requiring, its, adoption, as, a, safer, alternative, for, match, manufacture, the, toxicity, of, white, phosphorus, led, to, discontinuation, of, its, use, in, matches, the, allies, used, phosphorus, incendiary, bombs, in, world, war, ii, to, destroy, hamburg, the, place, where, the, miraculous, bearer, of, light, was, first, discovered, in, 2017, the, usgs, estimated, 68, billion, tons, of, world, reserves, where, reserve, figures, refer, to, the, amount, assumed, recoverable, at, current, market, prices, 0, 261, billion, tons, were, mined, in, 2016, critical, to, contemporary, agriculture, its, annual, demand, is, rising, nearly, twice, as, fast, as, the, growth, of, the, human, population, the, production, of, phosphorus, may, have, peaked, before, 2011, and, some, scientists, predict, reserves, will, be, depleted, before, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, phosphorus, comprises, about, 0, 1, by, mass, of, the, average, rock, and, consequently, the, earth, s, supply, is, vast, though, dilute, most, phosphorus, bearing, material, is, for, agriculture, fertilisers, in, this, case, where, the, standards, of, purity, are, modest, phosphorus, is, obtained, from, phosphate, rock, by, what, is, called, the, wet, process, the, minerals, are, treated, with, sulfuric, acid, to, give, phosphoric, acid, phosphoric, acid, is, then, neutralized, to, give, various, phosphate, salts, which, comprise, fertilizers, in, the, wet, process, phosphorus, does, not, undergo, redox, about, five, tons, of, phosphogypsum, waste, are, generated, per, ton, of, phosphoric, acid, production, annually, the, estimated, generation, of, phosphogypsum, worldwide, is, 100, to, 280, mt, for, the, use, of, phosphorus, in, drugs, detergents, and, foodstuff, the, standards, of, purity, are, high, which, led, to, the, development, of, the, thermal, process, in, this, process, phosphate, minerals, are, converted, to, white, phosphorus, which, can, be, purified, by, distillation, the, white, phosphorus, is, then, oxidised, to, phosphoric, acid, and, subsequently, neutralised, with, a, base, to, give, phosphate, salts, the, thermal, process, is, conducted, in, a, submerged, arc, furnace, which, is, energy, intensive, presently, about, 1, 000, 000, short, tons, 910, 000, t, of, elemental, phosphorus, is, produced, annually, calcium, phosphate, as, phosphate, rock, mostly, mined, in, florida, and, north, africa, can, be, heated, to, 1, 200, 1, 500, c, with, sand, which, is, mostly, sio, 2, and, coke, to, produce, p, 4, the, p, 4, product, being, volatile, is, readily, isolated, side, products, from, the, thermal, process, include, ferrophosphorus, a, crude, form, of, fe, 2, p, resulting, from, iron, impurities, in, the, mineral, precursors, the, silicate, slag, is, a, useful, construction, material, the, fluoride, is, sometimes, recovered, for, use, in, water, fluoridation, more, problematic, is, a, mud, containing, significant, amounts, of, white, phosphorus, production, of, white, phosphorus, is, conducted, in, large, facilities, in, part, because, it, is, energy, intensive, the, white, phosphorus, is, transported, in, molten, form, some, major, accidents, have, occurred, during, transportation, historically, before, the, development, of, mineral, based, extractions, white, phosphorus, was, isolated, on, an, industrial, scale, from, bone, ash, in, this, process, the, tricalcium, phosphate, in, bone, ash, is, converted, to, monocalcium, phosphate, with, sulfuric, acid, monocalcium, phosphate, is, then, dehydrated, to, the, corresponding, metaphosphate, when, ignited, to, a, white, heat, 1300, c, with, charcoal, calcium, metaphosphate, yields, two, thirds, of, its, weight, of, white, phosphorus, while, one, third, of, the, phosphorus, remains, in, the, residue, as, calcium, orthophosphate, peak, phosphorus, is, a, concept, to, describe, the, point, in, time, when, humanity, reaches, the, maximum, global, production, rate, of, phosphorus, as, an, industrial, and, commercial, raw, material, the, term, is, used, in, an, equivalent, way, to, the, better, known, term, peak, oil, the, issue, was, raised, as, a, debate, on, whether, phosphorus, shortages, might, be, imminent, around, 2010, which, was, largely, dismissed, after, usgs, and, other, organizations, increased, world, estimates, on, available, phosphorus, resources, mostly, in, the, form, of, additional, resources, in, morocco, however, exact, reserve, quantities, remain, uncertain, as, do, the, possible, impacts, of, increased, phosphate, use, on, future, generations, this, is, important, because, rock, phosphate, is, a, key, ingredient, in, many, inorganic, fertilizers, hence, a, shortage, in, rock, phosphate, or, just, significant, price, increases, might, negatively, affect, the, world, s, food, security, phosphorus, is, a, finite, limited, resource, that, is, widespread, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, in, living, organisms, but, is, relatively, scarce, in, concentrated, forms, which, are, not, evenly, distributed, across, the, earth, the, only, cost, effective, production, method, to, date, is, the, mining, of, phosphate, rock, but, only, a, few, countries, have, significant, commercial, reserves, the, top, five, are, morocco, including, reserves, located, in, western, sahara, china, egypt, algeria, and, syria, estimates, for, future, production, vary, significantly, depending, on, modelling, and, assumptions, on, extractable, volumes, but, it, is, inescapable, that, future, production, of, phosphate, rock, will, be, heavily, influenced, by, morocco, in, the, foreseeable, future, means, of, commercial, phosphorus, production, besides, mining, are, few, because, the, phosphorus, cycle, does, not, include, significant, gas, phase, transport, the, predominant, source, of, phosphorus, in, modern, times, is, phosphate, rock, as, opposed, to, the, guano, that, preceded, it, according, to, some, researchers, earth, s, commercial, and, affordable, phosphorus, reserves, are, expected, to, be, depleted, in, 50, 100, years, and, peak, phosphorus, to, be, reached, in, approximately, 2030, others, suggest, that, supplies, will, last, for, several, hundreds, of, years, as, with, the, timing, of, peak, oil, the, question, is, not, settled, and, researchers, in, different, fields, regularly, publish, different, estimates, of, the, rock, phosphate, reserves, the, peak, phosphorus, concept, is, connected, with, the, concept, of, planetary, boundaries, phosphorus, as, part, of, biogeochemical, processes, belongs, to, one, of, the, nine, earth, system, processes, which, are, known, to, have, boundaries, as, long, as, the, boundaries, are, not, crossed, they, mark, the, safe, zone, for, the, planet, the, accurate, determination, of, peak, phosphorus, is, dependent, on, knowing, the, total, world, s, commercial, phosphate, reserves, and, resources, especially, in, the, form, of, phosphate, rock, a, summarizing, term, for, over, 300, ores, of, different, origin, composition, and, phosphate, content, reserves, refers, to, the, amount, assumed, recoverable, at, current, market, prices, and, resources, refers, to, estimated, amounts, of, such, a, grade, or, quality, that, they, have, reasonable, prospects, for, economic, extraction, unprocessed, phosphate, rock, has, a, concentration, of, 1, 7, 8, 7, phosphorus, by, mass, 4, 20, phosphorus, pentoxide, by, comparison, the, earth, s, crust, contains, 0, 1, phosphorus, by, mass, and, vegetation, 0, 03, 0, 2, although, quadrillions, of, tons, of, phosphorus, exist, in, the, earth, s, crust, these, are, currently, not, economically, extractable, in, 2023, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, estimated, that, economically, extractable, phosphate, rock, reserves, worldwide, are, 72, billion, tons, while, world, mining, production, in, 2022, was, 220, million, tons, assuming, zero, growth, the, reserves, would, thus, last, for, around, 300, years, this, broadly, confirms, a, 2010, international, fertilizer, development, center, ifdc, report, that, global, reserves, would, last, for, several, hundred, years, phosphorus, reserve, figures, are, intensely, debated, gilbert, suggest, that, there, has, been, little, external, verification, of, the, estimate, a, 2014, review, concluded, that, the, ifdc, report, presents, an, inflated, picture, of, global, reserves, in, particular, those, of, morocco, where, largely, hypothetical, and, inferred, resources, have, simply, been, relabeled, reserves, the, countries, with, most, phosphate, rock, commercial, reserves, in, billion, metric, tons, morocco, 50, china, 3, 2, egypt, 2, 8, algeria, 2, 2, syria, 1, 8, brazil, 1, 6, saudi, arabia, 1, 4, south, africa, 1, 4, australia, 1, 1, united, states, 1, 0, finland, 1, 0, russia, 0, 6, jordan, 0, 8, rock, phosphate, shortages, or, just, significant, price, increases, might, negatively, affect, the, world, s, food, security, many, agricultural, systems, depend, on, supplies, of, inorganic, fertilizer, which, use, rock, phosphate, under, the, food, production, regime, in, developed, countries, shortages, of, rock, phosphate, could, lead, to, shortages, of, inorganic, fertilizer, which, could, in, turn, reduce, the, global, food, production, economists, have, pointed, out, that, price, fluctuations, of, rock, phosphate, do, not, necessarily, indicate, peak, phosphorus, as, these, have, already, occurred, due, to, various, demand, and, supply, side, factors, us, production, of, phosphate, rock, peaked, in, 1980, at, 54, 4, million, metric, tons, the, united, states, was, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, phosphate, rock, from, at, least, 1900, up, until, 2006, when, us, production, was, exceeded, by, that, of, china, in, 2019, the, us, produced, 10, percent, of, the, world, s, phosphate, rock, in, 1609, garcilaso, de, la, vega, wrote, the, book, comentarios, reales, in, which, he, described, many, of, the, agricultural, practices, of, the, incas, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, and, introduced, the, use, of, guano, as, a, fertilizer, as, garcilaso, described, the, incas, near, the, coast, harvested, guano, in, the, early, 1800s, alexander, von, humboldt, introduced, guano, as, a, source, of, agricultural, fertilizer, to, europe, after, having, discovered, it, on, islands, off, the, coast, of, south, america, it, has, been, reported, that, at, the, time, of, its, discovery, the, guano, on, some, islands, was, over, 30, meters, deep, the, guano, had, previously, been, used, by, the, moche, people, as, a, source, of, fertilizer, by, mining, it, and, transporting, it, back, to, peru, by, boat, international, commerce, in, guano, did, not, start, until, after, 1840, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, guano, had, been, nearly, completely, depleted, and, was, eventually, overtaken, with, the, discovery, of, methods, of, production, of, superphosphate, phosphorus, can, be, transferred, from, the, soil, in, one, location, to, another, as, food, is, transported, across, the, world, taking, the, phosphorus, it, contains, with, it, once, consumed, by, humans, it, can, end, up, in, the, local, environment, in, the, case, of, open, defecation, which, is, still, widespread, on, a, global, scale, or, in, rivers, or, the, ocean, via, sewage, systems, and, sewage, treatment, plants, in, the, case, of, cities, connected, to, sewer, systems, an, example, of, one, crop, that, takes, up, large, amounts, of, phosphorus, is, soy, in, an, effort, to, postpone, the, onset, of, peak, phosphorus, several, methods, of, reducing, and, reusing, phosphorus, are, in, practice, such, as, in, agriculture, and, in, sanitation, systems, the, soil, association, the, uk, organic, agriculture, certification, and, pressure, group, issued, a, report, in, 2010, a, rock, and, a, hard, place, encouraging, more, recycling, of, phosphorus, one, potential, solution, to, the, shortage, of, phosphorus, is, greater, recycling, of, human, and, animal, wastes, back, into, the, environment, reducing, agricultural, runoff, and, soil, erosion, can, slow, the, frequency, with, which, farmers, have, to, reapply, phosphorus, to, their, fields, agricultural, methods, such, as, no, till, farming, terracing, contour, tilling, and, the, use, of, windbreaks, have, been, shown, to, reduce, the, rate, of, phosphorus, depletion, from, farmland, these, methods, are, still, dependent, on, a, periodic, application, of, phosphate, rock, to, the, soil, and, as, such, methods, to, recycle, the, lost, phosphorus, have, also, been, proposed, perennial, vegetation, such, as, grassland, or, forest, is, much, more, efficient, in, its, use, of, phosphate, than, arable, land, strips, of, grassland, and, or, forest, between, arable, land, and, rivers, can, greatly, reduce, losses, of, phosphate, and, other, nutrients, integrated, farming, systems, which, use, animal, sources, to, supply, phosphorus, for, crops, do, exist, at, smaller, scales, and, application, of, the, system, to, a, larger, scale, is, a, potential, alternative, for, supplying, the, nutrient, although, it, would, require, significant, changes, to, the, widely, adopted, modern, crop, fertilizing, methods, the, oldest, method, of, recycling, phosphorus, is, through, the, reuse, of, animal, manure, and, human, excreta, in, agriculture, via, this, method, phosphorus, in, the, foods, consumed, are, excreted, and, the, animal, or, human, excreta, are, subsequently, collected, and, re, applied, to, the, fields, although, this, method, has, maintained, civilizations, for, centuries, the, current, system, of, manure, management, is, not, logistically, geared, towards, application, to, crop, fields, on, a, large, scale, at, present, manure, application, could, not, meet, the, phosphorus, needs, of, large, scale, agriculture, despite, that, it, is, still, an, efficient, method, of, recycling, used, phosphorus, and, returning, it, to, the, soil, there, are, concerns, with, pathogens, in, manure, and, human, excreta, but, those, pathogens, can, be, eliminated, via, suitable, treatment, however, especially, in, the, global, south, these, processes, are, not, always, followed, leading, to, outbreaks, of, diseases, transmitted, via, the, fecal, oral, route, such, as, cholera, sewage, treatment, plants, that, have, an, enhanced, biological, phosphorus, removal, step, produce, a, sewage, sludge, that, is, rich, in, phosphorus, various, processes, have, been, developed, to, extract, phosphorus, from, sewage, sludge, directly, from, the, ash, after, incineration, of, the, sewage, sludge, or, from, other, products, of, sewage, sludge, treatment, this, includes, the, extraction, of, phosphorus, rich, materials, such, as, struvite, from, waste, processing, plants, the, struvite, can, be, made, by, adding, magnesium, to, the, waste, some, companies, such, as, ostara, in, canada, and, nuresys, in, belgium, are, already, using, this, technique, to, recover, phosphate, research, on, phosphorus, recovery, methods, from, sewage, sludge, has, been, carried, out, in, sweden, and, germany, since, around, 2003, but, the, technologies, currently, under, development, are, not, yet, cost, effective, given, the, current, price, of, phosphorus, on, the, world, market, the, above, routes, refer, to, production, in, the, chemical, sense, i, e, extracting, a, desired, element, or, compound, from, a, source, without, changing, the, atoms, themselves, however, there, is, a, process, which, produces, phosphorus, in, a, nuclear, sense, in, that, atoms, of, another, element, are, turned, into, phosphorus, while, the, amount, of, phosphorus, produced, this, way, is, minuscule, it, is, nonetheless, a, crucial, process, in, semiconductor, production, neutron, transmutation, doping, ntd, is, an, unusual, doping, method, for, special, applications, most, commonly, it, is, used, to, dope, silicon, n, type, in, high, power, electronics, and, semiconductor, detectors, it, is, based, on, the, conversion, of, the, 30, si, isotope, into, phosphorus, atoms, by, neutron, absorption, and, beta, decay, as, follows, 30, s, i, n, 31, s, i, 31, p, t, 1, 2, 2, 62, h, displaystyle, 30, mathrm, si, n, gamma, 31, mathrm, si, rightarrow, 31, mathrm, p, beta, t, 1, 2, 2, 62, mathrm, h, in, practice, the, silicon, is, typically, placed, near, or, inside, a, nuclear, reactor, most, commonly, a, research, reactor, e, g, the, one, at, mit, to, receive, the, neutrons, as, neutrons, continue, to, pass, through, the, silicon, more, and, more, phosphorus, atoms, are, produced, by, transmutation, and, therefore, the, doping, becomes, more, and, more, strongly, n, type, ntd, is, a, far, less, common, doping, method, than, diffusion, or, ion, implantation, but, it, has, the, advantage, of, creating, an, extremely, uniform, dopant, distribution, phosphorus, compounds, are, used, as, flame, retardants, flame, retardant, materials, and, coatings, are, being, developed, that, are, both, phosphorus, and, bio, based, phosphorus, is, an, essential, mineral, for, humans, listed, in, the, dietary, reference, intake, dri, food, grade, phosphoric, acid, additive, e338, is, used, to, acidify, foods, and, beverages, such, as, various, colas, and, jams, providing, a, tangy, or, sour, taste, the, phosphoric, acid, also, serves, as, a, preservative, soft, drinks, containing, phosphoric, acid, including, coca, cola, are, sometimes, called, phosphate, sodas, or, phosphates, phosphoric, acid, in, soft, drinks, has, the, potential, to, cause, dental, erosion, phosphoric, acid, also, has, the, potential, to, contribute, to, the, formation, of, kidney, stones, especially, in, those, who, have, had, kidney, stones, previously, phosphorus, is, an, essential, plant, nutrient, the, most, often, limiting, nutrient, after, nitrogen, and, the, bulk, of, all, phosphorus, production, is, in, concentrated, phosphoric, acids, for, agriculture, fertilisers, containing, as, much, as, 70, to, 75, p, 2, o, 5, that, led, to, large, increase, in, phosphate, po, 4, 3, production, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, artificial, phosphate, fertilisation, is, necessary, because, phosphorus, is, essential, to, all, living, organisms, it, is, involved, in, energy, transfers, strength, of, root, and, stems, photosynthesis, the, expansion, of, plant, roots, formation, of, seeds, and, flowers, and, other, important, factors, effecting, overall, plant, health, and, genetics, heavy, use, of, phosphorus, fertilizers, and, their, runoff, have, resulted, in, eutrophication, overenrichment, of, aquatic, ecosystems, natural, phosphorus, bearing, compounds, are, mostly, inaccessible, to, plants, because, of, the, low, solubility, and, mobility, in, soil, most, phosphorus, is, very, stable, in, the, soil, minerals, or, organic, matter, of, the, soil, even, when, phosphorus, is, added, in, manure, or, fertilizer, it, can, become, fixed, in, the, soil, therefore, the, natural, phosphorus, cycle, is, very, slow, some, of, the, fixed, phosphorus, is, released, again, over, time, sustaining, wild, plant, growth, however, more, is, needed, to, sustain, intensive, cultivation, of, crops, fertiliser, is, often, in, the, form, of, superphosphate, of, lime, a, mixture, of, calcium,

minerals, with, sulfuric, acid, for, obtaining, fertiliser, is, so, important, to, the, global, economy, that, this, is, the, primary, industrial, market, for, sulfuric, acid, and, the, greatest, industrial, use, of, elemental, sulfur, white, phosphorus, is, widely, used, to, make, organophosphorus, compounds, through, intermediate, phosphorus, chlorides, and, two, phosphorus, sulfides, phosphorus, pentasulfide, and, phosphorus, sesquisulfide, organophosphorus, compounds, have, many, applications, including, in, plasticisers, flame, retardants, pesticides, extraction, agents, nerve, agents, and, water, treatment, phosphorus, is, also, an, important, component, in, steel, production, in, the, making, of, phosphor, bronze, and, in, many, other, related, products, phosphorus, is, added, to, metallic, copper, during, its, smelting, process, to, react, with, oxygen, present, as, an, impurity, in, copper, and, to, produce, phosphorus, containing, copper, cuofp, alloys, with, a, higher, hydrogen, embrittlement, resistance, than, normal, copper, phosphate, conversion, coating, is, a, chemical, treatment, applied, to, steel, parts, to, improve, their, corrosion, resistance, the, first, striking, match, with, a, phosphorus, head, was, invented, by, charles, sauria, in, 1830, these, matches, and, subsequent, modifications, were, made, with, heads, of, white, phosphorus, an, oxygen, releasing, compound, potassium, chlorate, lead, dioxide, or, sometimes, nitrate, and, a, binder, they, were, poisonous, to, the, workers, in, manufacture, sensitive, to, storage, conditions, toxic, if, ingested, and, hazardous, when, accidentally, ignited, on, a, rough, surface, production, in, several, countries, was, banned, between, 1872, and, 1925, the, international, berne, convention, ratified, in, 1906, prohibited, the, use, of, white, phosphorus, in, matches, in, consequence, phosphorous, matches, were, gradually, replaced, by, safer, alternatives, around, 1900, french, chemists, henri, s, v, ne, and, emile, david, cahen, invented, the, modern, strike, anywhere, match, wherein, the, white, phosphorus, was, replaced, by, phosphorus, sesquisulfide, p, 4, s, 3, a, non, toxic, and, non, pyrophoric, compound, that, ignites, under, friction, for, a, time, these, safer, strike, anywhere, matches, were, quite, popular, but, in, the, long, run, they, were, superseded, by, the, modern, safety, match, safety, matches, are, very, difficult, to, ignite, on, any, surface, other, than, a, special, striker, strip, the, strip, contains, non, toxic, red, phosphorus, and, the, match, head, potassium, chlorate, an, oxygen, releasing, compound, when, struck, small, amounts, of, abrasion, from, match, head, and, striker, strip, are, mixed, intimately, to, make, a, small, quantity, of, armstrong, s, mixture, a, very, touch, sensitive, composition, the, fine, powder, ignites, immediately, and, provides, the, initial, spark, to, set, off, the, match, head, safety, matches, separate, the, two, components, of, the, ignition, mixture, until, the, match, is, struck, this, is, the, key, safety, advantage, as, it, prevents, accidental, ignition, nonetheless, safety, matches, invented, in, 1844, by, gustaf, erik, pasch, and, market, ready, by, the, 1860s, did, not, gain, consumer, acceptance, until, the, prohibition, of, white, phosphorus, using, a, dedicated, striker, strip, was, considered, clumsy, sodium, tripolyphosphate, made, from, phosphoric, acid, is, used, in, laundry, detergents, in, some, countries, but, banned, for, this,

about, 85, 90, in, bones, and, teeth, in, the, form, of, apatite, and, the, remainder, in, soft, tissues, and, extracellular, fluids, the, phosphorus, content, increases, from, about, 0, 5, by, mass, in, infancy, to, 0, 65, 1, 1, by, mass, in, adults, average, phosphorus, concentration, in, the, blood, is, about, 0, 4, g, l, about, 70, of, that, is, organic, and, 30, inorganic, phosphates, an, adult, with, healthy, diet, consumes, and, excretes, about, 1, 3, grams, of, phosphorus, per, day, with, consumption, in, the, form, of, inorganic, phosphate, and, phosphorus, containing, biomolecules, such, as, nucleic, acids, and, phospholipids, and, excretion, almost, exclusively, in, the, form, of, phosphate, ions, such, as, h, 2, po, 4, and, hpo, 2, 4, only, about, 0, 1, of, body, phosphate, circulates, in, the, blood, paralleling, the, amount, of, phosphate, available, to, soft, tissue, cells, the, main, component, of, bone, is, hydroxyapatite, as, well, as, amorphous, forms, of, calcium, phosphate, possibly, including, carbonate, hydroxyapatite, is, the, main, component, of, tooth, enamel, water, fluoridation, enhances, the, resistance, of, teeth, to, decay, by, the, partial, conversion, of, this, mineral, to, the, still, harder, material, fluorapatite, in, medicine, phosphate, deficiency, syndrome, may, be, caused, by, malnutrition, by, failure, to, absorb, phosphate, and, by, metabolic, syndromes, that, draw, phosphate, from, the, blood, such, as, in, refeeding, syndrome, after, malnutrition, or, passing, too, much, of, it, into, the, urine, all, are, characterised, by, hypophosphatemia, which, is, a, condition, of, low, levels, of, soluble, phosphate, levels, in, the, blood, serum, and, inside, the, cells, symptoms, of, hypophosphatemia, include, neurological, dysfunction, and, disruption, of, muscle, and, blood, cells, due, to, lack, of, atp, too, much, phosphate, can, lead, to, diarrhoea, and, calcification, hardening, of, organs, and, soft, tissue, and, can, interfere, with, the, body, s, ability, to, use, iron, calcium, magnesium, and, zinc, phosphorus, is, an, essential, macromineral, for, plants, which, is, studied, extensively, in, edaphology, to, understand, plant, uptake, from, soil, systems, phosphorus, is, a, limiting, factor, in, many, ecosystems, that, is, the, scarcity, of, phosphorus, limits, the, rate, of, organism, growth, an, excess, of, phosphorus, can, also, be, problematic, especially, in, aquatic, systems, where, eutrophication, sometimes, leads, to, algal, blooms, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, iom, updated, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, for, phosphorus, in, 1997, if, there, is, not, sufficient, information, to, establish, ears, and, rdas, an, estimate, designated, adequate, intake, ai, is, used, instead, the, current, ear, for, phosphorus, for, people, ages, 19, and, up, is, 580, mg, day, the, rda, is, 700, mg, day, rdas, are, higher, than, ears, so, as, to, identify, amounts, that, will, cover, people, with, higher, than, average, requirements, rda, for, pregnancy, and, lactation, are, also, 700, mg, day, for, people, ages, 1, 18, years, the, rda, increases, with, age, from, 460, to, 1250, mg, day, as, for, safety, the, iom, sets, tolerable, upper, intake, levels, uls, for, vitamins, and, minerals, when, evidence, is, sufficient, in, the, case, of, phosphorus, the, ul, is, 4000, mg, day, collectively, the, ears, rdas, ais, and, uls, are, referred, to, as, dietary, reference, intakes, dris, the, european, food,

instead, of, ear, ai, and, ul, are, defined, the, same, as, in, the, united, states, for, people, ages, 15, and, older, including, pregnancy, and, lactation, the, ai, is, set, at, 550, mg, day, for, children, ages, 4, 10, the, ai, is, 440, mg, day, and, for, ages, 11, 17, it, is, 640, mg, day, these, ais, are, lower, than, the, u, s, rdas, in, both, systems, teenagers, need, more, than, adults, the, european, food, safety, authority, reviewed, the, same, safety, question, and, decided, that, there, was, not, sufficient, information, to, set, a, ul, for, u, s, food, and, dietary, supplement, labeling, purposes, the, amount, in, a, serving, is, expressed, as, a, percent, of, daily, value, dv, for, phosphorus, labeling, purposes, 100, of, the, daily, value, was, 1000, mg, but, as, of, may, 27, 2016, it, was, revised, to, 1250, mg, to, bring, it, into, agreement, with, the, rda, a, table, of, the, old, and, new, adult, daily, values, is, provided, at, reference, daily, intake, the, main, food, sources, for, phosphorus, are, the, same, as, those, containing, protein, although, proteins, do, not, contain, phosphorus, for, example, milk, meat, and, soya, typically, also, have, phosphorus, as, a, rule, if, a, diet, has, sufficient, protein, and, calcium, the, amount, of, phosphorus, is, probably, sufficient, organic, compounds, of, phosphorus, form, a, wide, class, of, materials, many, are, required, for, life, but, some, are, extremely, toxic, fluorophosphate, esters, are, among, the, most, potent, neurotoxins, known, a, wide, range, of, organophosphorus, compounds, are, used, for, their, toxicity, as, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc, and, weaponised, as, nerve, agents, against, enemy, humans, most, inorganic, phosphates, are, relatively, nontoxic, and, essential, nutrients, the, white, phosphorus, allotrope, presents, a, significant, hazard, because, it, ignites, in, the, air, and, produces, phosphoric, acid, residue, chronic, white, phosphorus, poisoning, leads, to, necrosis, of, the, jaw, called, phossy, jaw, white, phosphorus, is, toxic, causing, severe, liver, damage, on, ingestion, and, may, cause, a, condition, known, as, smoking, stool, syndrome, in, the, past, external, exposure, to, elemental, phosphorus, was, treated, by, washing, the, affected, area, with, 2, copper, ii, sulfate, solution, to, form, harmless, compounds, that, are, then, washed, away, according, to, the, recent, us, navy, s, treatment, of, chemical, agent, casualties, and, conventional, military, chemical, injuries, fm8, 285, part, 2, conventional, military, chemical, injuries, cupric, copper, ii, sulfate, has, been, used, by, u, s, personnel, in, the, past, and, is, still, being, used, by, some, nations, however, copper, sulfate, is, toxic, and, its, use, will, be, discontinued, copper, sulfate, may, produce, kidney, and, cerebral, toxicity, as, well, as, intravascular, hemolysis, the, manual, suggests, instead, a, bicarbonate, solution, to, neutralise, phosphoric, acid, which, will, then, allow, removal, of, visible, white, phosphorus, particles, often, can, be, located, by, their, emission, of,
