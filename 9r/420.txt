rhenium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, re, and, atomic, number, 75, it, is, a, silvery, gray, heavy, third, row, transition, metal, in, group, 7, of, the, periodic, table, with, an, estimated, average, concentration, of, 1, part, per, billion, ppb, rhenium, is, one, of, the, rarest, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, has, the, third, highest, melting, point, and, second, highest, boiling, point, of, any, element, at, 5869, k, it, resembles, manganese, and, technetium, chemically, and, is, mainly, obtained, as, a, by, product, of, the, extraction, and, refinement, of, molybdenum, and, copper, ores, it, shows, in, its, compounds, a, wide, variety, of, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 1, to, 7, rhenium, was, originally, discovered, by, masataka, ogawa, in, 1908, but, he, mistakenly, assigned, it, as, element, 43, rather, than, element, 75, and, named, it, nipponium, it, was, rediscovered, by, walter, noddack, ida, tacke, and, otto, berg, in, 1925, who, gave, it, its, present, name, it, was, named, after, the, river, rhine, in, europe, from, which, the, earliest, samples, had, been, obtained, and, worked, commercially, nickel, based, superalloys, of, rhenium, are, used, in, combustion, chambers, turbine, blades, and, exhaust, nozzles, of, jet, engines, these, alloys, contain, up, to, 6, rhenium, making, jet, engine, construction, the, largest, single, use, for, the, element, the, second, most, important, use, is, as, a, catalyst, it, is, an, excellent, catalyst, for, hydrogenation, and, isomerization, and, is, used, for, example, in, catalytic, reforming, of, naphtha, for, use, in, gasoline, rheniforming, process, because, of, the, low, availability, relative, to, demand, it, is, expensive, with, price, reaching, an, all, time, high, in, 2008, 2009, of, us, 10, 600, per, kilogram, us, 4, 800, per, pound, due, to, increases, in, recycling, and, a, drop, in, demand, for, rhenium, in, catalysts, the, price, had, dropped, to, us, 2, 844, per, kilogram, us, 1, 290, per, pound, as, of, july, 2018, in, 1908, japanese, chemist, masataka, ogawa, announced, that, he, had, discovered, the, 43rd, element, and, named, it, nipponium, np, after, japan, nippon, in, japanese, in, fact, he, had, found, element, 75, rhenium, instead, of, element, 43, both, elements, are, in, the, same, group, of, the, periodic, table, ogawa, s, work, was, often, incorrectly, cited, because, some, of, his, key, results, were, published, only, in, japanese, it, is, likely, that, his, insistence, on, searching, for, element, 43, prevented, him, from, considering, that, he, might, have, found, element, 75, instead, just, before, ogawa, s, death, in, 1930, kenjiro, kimura, analysed, ogawa, s, sample, by, x, ray, spectroscopy, at, the, imperial, university, of, tokyo, and, said, to, a, friend, that, it, was, beautiful, rhenium, indeed, he, did, not, reveal, this, publicly, because, under, the, japanese, university, culture, before, world, war, ii, it, was, frowned, upon, to, point, out, the, mistakes, of, one, s, seniors, but, the, evidence, became, known, to, some, japanese, news, media, regardless, as, time, passed, with, no, repetitions, of, the, experiments, or, new, work, on, nipponium, ogawa, s, claim, faded, away, the, symbol, np, was, later, used, for, the, element, neptunium, and, the, name, nihonium, also, named, after, japan, along, with, symbol, nh, was, later, used, for, element, 113, element, 113, was, also, discovered, by, a, team, of, japanese, scientists, and, was, named, in, respectful, homage, to, ogawa, s, work, today, ogawa, s, claim, is, widely, accepted, as, having, been, the, discovery, of, element, 75, in, hindsight, rhenium, latin, rhenus, meaning, rhine, received, its, current, name, when, it, was, rediscovered, by, walter, noddack, ida, noddack, and, otto, berg, in, germany, in, 1925, they, reported, that, they, had, detected, the, element, in, platinum, ore, and, in, the, mineral, columbite, they, also, found, rhenium, in, gadolinite, and, molybdenite, in, 1928, they, were, able, to, extract, 1, g, of, the, element, by, processing, 660, kg, of, molybdenite, it, was, estimated, in, 1968, that, 75, of, the, rhenium, metal, in, the, united, states, was, used, for, research, and, the, development, of, refractory, metal, alloys, it, took, several, years, from, that, point, before, the, superalloys, became, widely, used, the, original, mischaracterization, by, ogawa, in, 1908, and, final, work, in, 1925, makes, rhenium, perhaps, the, last, stable, element, to, be, understood, hafnium, was, discovered, in, 1923, and, all, other, new, elements, discovered, since, then, such, as, francium, are, radioactive, rhenium, is, a, silvery, white, metal, with, one, of, the, highest, melting, points, of, all, elements, exceeded, by, only, tungsten, at, standard, pressure, carbon, sublimes, rather, than, melts, though, its, sublimation, point, is, comparable, to, the, melting, points, of, tungsten, and, rhenium, it, also, has, one, of, the, highest, boiling, points, of, all, elements, and, the, highest, among, stable, elements, it, is, also, one, of, the, densest, exceeded, only, by, platinum, iridium, and, osmium, rhenium, has, a, hexagonal, close, packed, crystal, structure, its, usual, commercial, form, is, a, powder, but, this, element, can, be, consolidated, by, pressing, and, sintering, in, a, vacuum, or, hydrogen, atmosphere, this, procedure, yields, a, compact, solid, having, a, density, above, 90, of, the, density, of, the, metal, when, annealed, this, metal, is, very, ductile, and, can, be, bent, coiled, or, rolled, rhenium, molybdenum, alloys, are, superconductive, at, 10, k, tungsten, rhenium, alloys, are, also, superconductive, around, 4, 8, k, depending, on, the, alloy, rhenium, metal, superconducts, at, 1, 697, 0, 006, k, in, bulk, form, and, at, room, temperature, and, atmospheric, pressure, the, element, resists, alkalis, sulfuric, acid, hydrochloric, acid, nitric, acid, and, aqua, regia, it, will, however, react, with, nitric, acid, upon, heating, rhenium, has, one, stable, isotope, rhenium, 185, which, nevertheless, occurs, in, minority, abundance, a, situation, found, only, in, two, other, elements, indium, and, tellurium, naturally, occurring, rhenium, is, only, 37, 4, 185, re, and, 62, 6, 187, re, which, is, unstable, but, has, a, very, long, half, life, 10, 10, years, a, kilogram, of, natural, rhenium, emits, 1, 07, mbq, of, radiation, due, to, the, presence, of, this, isotope, this, lifetime, can, be, greatly, affected, by, the, charge, state, of, the, rhenium, atom, the, beta, decay, of, 187, re, is, used, for, rhenium, osmium, dating, of, ores, the, available, energy, for, this, beta, decay, 2, 6, kev, is, the, second, lowest, known, among, all, radionuclides, only, behind, the, decay, from, 115, in, to, excited, 115, sn, 0, 147, kev, the, isotope, rhenium, 186m, is, notable, as, being, one, of, the, longest, lived, metastable, isotopes, with, a, half, life, of, around, 200, 000, years, there, are, 33, other, unstable, isotopes, that, have, been, recognized, ranging, from, 160, re, to, 194, re, the, longest, lived, of, which, is, 183, re, with, a, half, life, of, 70, days, rhenium, compounds, are, known, for, all, the, oxidation, states, between, 3, and, 7, except, 2, the, oxidation, states, 7, 4, and, 3, are, the, most, common, rhenium, is, most, available, commercially, as, salts, of, perrhenate, including, sodium, and, ammonium, perrhenates, these, are, white, water, soluble, compounds, tetrathioperrhenate, anion, is, possible, the, most, common, rhenium, chlorides, are, recl, 6, recl, 5, recl, 4, and, recl, 3, the, structures, of, these, compounds, often, feature, extensive, re, re, bonding, which, is, characteristic, of, this, metal, in, oxidation, states, lower, than, vii, salts, of, 2, feature, a, quadruple, metal, metal, bond, although, the, highest, rhenium, chloride, features, re, vi, fluorine, gives, the, d, 0, re, vii, derivative, rhenium, heptafluoride, bromides, and, iodides, of, rhenium, are, also, well, known, including, rhenium, pentabromide, and, rhenium, tetraiodide, like, tungsten, and, molybdenum, with, which, it, shares, chemical, similarities, rhenium, forms, a, variety, of, oxyhalides, the,

perrhenate, salts, and, purified, by, recrystallization, total, world, production, is, between, 40, and, 50, tons, year, the, main, producers, are, in, chile, the, united, states, peru, and, poland, recycling, of, used, pt, re, catalyst, and, special, alloys, allow, the, recovery, of, another, 10, tons, per, year, prices, for, the, metal, rose, rapidly, in, early, 2008, from, 1000, 2000, per, kg, in, 2003, 2006, to, over, 10, 000, in, february, 2008, the, metal, form, is, prepared, by, reducing, ammonium, perrhenate, with, hydrogen, at, high, temperatures, there, are, technologies, for, the, associated, extraction, of, rhenium, from, productive, solutions, of, underground, leaching, of, uranium, ores, rhenium, is, added, to, high, temperature, superalloys, that, are, used, to, make, jet, engine, parts, using, 70, of, the, worldwide, rhenium, production, another, major, application, is, in, platinum, rhenium, catalysts, which, are, primarily, used, in, making, lead, free, high, octane, gasoline, the, nickel, based, superalloys, have, improved, creep, strength, with, the, addition, of, rhenium, the, alloys, normally, contain, 3, or, 6, of, rhenium, second, generation, alloys, contain, 3, these, alloys, were, used, in, the, engines, for, the, f, 15, and, f, 16, whereas, the, newer, single, crystal, third, generation, alloys, contain, 6, of, rhenium, they, are, used, in, the, f, 22, and, f, 35, engines, rhenium, is, also, used, in, the, superalloys, such, as, cmsx, 4, 2nd, gen, and, cmsx, 10, 3rd, gen, that, are, used, in, industrial, gas, turbine, engines, like, the, ge, 7fa, rhenium, can, cause, superalloys, to, become, microstructurally, unstable, forming, undesirable, topologically, close, packed, tcp, phases, in, 4th, and, 5th, generation, superalloys, ruthenium, is, used, to, avoid, this, effect, among, others, the, new, superalloys, are, epm, 102, with, 3, ru, and, tms, 162, with, 6, ru, as, well, as, tms, 138, and, tms, 174, for, 2006, the, consumption, is, given, as, 28, for, general, electric, 28, rolls, royce, plc, and, 12, pratt, whitney, all, for, superalloys, whereas, the, use, for, catalysts, only, accounts, for, 14, and, the, remaining, applications, use, 18, in, 2006, 77, of, rhenium, consumption, in, the, united, states, was, in, alloys, the, rising, demand, for, military, jet, engines, and, the, constant, supply, made, it, necessary, to, develop, superalloys, with, a, lower, rhenium, content, for, example, the, newer, cfm, international, cfm56, high, pressure, turbine, hpt, blades, will, use, rene, n515, with, a, rhenium, content, of, 1, 5, instead, of, rene, n5, with, 3, rhenium, improves, the, properties, of, tungsten, tungsten, rhenium, alloys, are, more, ductile, at, low, temperature, allowing, them, to, be, more, easily, machined, the, high, temperature, stability, is, also, improved, the, effect, increases, with, the, rhenium, concentration, and, therefore, tungsten, alloys, are, produced, with, up, to, 27, of, re, which, is, the, solubility, limit, tungsten, rhenium, wire, was, originally, created, in, efforts, to, develop, a, wire, that, was, more, ductile, after, recrystallization, this, allows, the, wire, to, meet, specific, performance, objectives, including, superior, vibration, resistance, improved, ductility, and, higher, resistivity, one, application, for, the, tungsten, rhenium, alloys, is, x, ray, sources, the, high, melting, point, of, both, elements, together, with, their, high, atomic, mass, makes, them, stable, against, the, prolonged, electron, impact, rhenium, tungsten, alloys, are, also, applied, as, thermocouples, to, measure, temperatures, up, to, 2200, c, the, high, temperature, stability, low, vapor, pressure, good, wear, resistance, and, ability, to, withstand, arc, corrosion, of, rhenium, are, useful, in, self, cleaning, electrical, contacts, in, particular, the, discharge, that, occurs, during, electrical, switching, oxidizes, the, contacts, however, rhenium, oxide, re, 2, o, 7, is, volatile, sublimes, at, 360, c, and, therefore, is, removed, during, the, discharge, rhenium, has, a, high, melting, point, and, a, low, vapor, pressure, similar, to, tantalum, and, tungsten, therefore, rhenium, filaments, exhibit, a, higher, stability, if, the, filament, is, operated, not, in, vacuum, but, in, oxygen, containing, atmosphere, those, filaments, are, widely, used, in, mass, spectrometers, ion, gauges, and, photoflash, lamps, in, photography, rhenium, in, the, form, of, rhenium, platinum, alloy, is, used, as, catalyst, for, catalytic, reforming, which, is, a, chemical, process, to, convert, petroleum, refinery, naphthas, with, low, octane, ratings, into, high, octane, liquid, products, worldwide, 30, of, catalysts, used, for, this, process, contain, rhenium, the, olefin, metathesis, is, the, other, reaction, for, which, rhenium, is, used, as, catalyst, normally, re, 2, o, 7, on, alumina, is, used, for, this, process, rhenium, catalysts, are, very, resistant, to, chemical, poisoning, from, nitrogen, sulfur, and, phosphorus, and, so, are, used, in, certain, kinds, of, hydrogenation, reactions, the, isotopes, 186, re, and, 188, re, are, radioactive, and, are, used, for, treatment, of, liver, cancer, they, both, have, similar, penetration, depth, in, tissue, 5, mm, for, 186, re, and, 11, mm, for, 188, re, but, 186, re, has, the, advantage, of, a, longer, half, life, 90, hours, vs, 17, hours, 188, re, is, also, being, used, experimentally, in, a, novel, treatment, of, pancreatic, cancer, where, it, is, delivered, by, means, of, the, bacterium, listeria, monocytogenes, the, 188, re, isotope, is, also, used, for, the, rhenium, sct, skin, cancer, therapy, the, treatment, uses, the, isotope, s, properties, as, a, beta, emitter, for, brachytherapy, in, the, treatment, of, basal, cell, carcinoma, and, squamous, cell, carcinoma, of, the, skin, related, by, periodic, trends, rhenium, has, a, similar, chemistry, to, that, of, technetium, work, done, to, label, rhenium, onto, target, compounds, can, often, be, translated, to, technetium, this, is, useful, for, radiopharmacy, where, it, is, difficult, to, work, with, technetium, especially, the, technetium, 99m, isotope, used, in, medicine, due, to, its, expense, and, short, half, life, rhenium, is, used, in, manufacturing, high, precision, equipment, like, gyroscopes, its, high, density, mechanical, stability, and, corrosion, resistance, characteristics, ensure, the, equipment, s, durability, and, precise, performance, in, demanding, conditions, rhenium, cathodes, are, also, used, for, their, stability, and, precision, in, spectral, analysis, very, little, is, known, about, the, toxicity, of, rhenium, and, its, compounds, because, they, are, used, in, very, small, amounts, soluble, salts, such, as, the, rhenium, halides, or, perrhenates, could, be, hazardous, due, to, elements, other, than, rhenium, or, due, to, rhenium, itself, only, a, few, compounds, of, rhenium, have, been, tested, for, their, acute, toxicity, two, examples, are, potassium, perrhenate, and, rhenium, trichloride, which, were, injected, as, a, solution, into, rats, the, perrhenate, had, an, ld, 50, value, of, 2800, mg, kg, after, seven, days, this, is, very, low, toxicity, similar, to, that, of, table, salt, and, the, rhenium, trichloride, showed, ld, 50, of, 280, mg, kg
