the, chronology, of, the, universe, describes, the, history, and, future, of, the, universe, according, to, big, bang, cosmology, research, published, in, 2015, estimates, the, earliest, stages, of, the, universe, s, existence, as, taking, place, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, with, an, uncertainty, of, around, 21, million, years, at, the, 68, confidence, level, for, the, purposes, of, this, summary, it, is, convenient, to, divide, the, chronology, of, the, universe, since, it, originated, into, five, parts, it, is, generally, considered, meaningless, or, unclear, whether, time, existed, before, this, chronology, the, first, picosecond, 10, 12, seconds, of, cosmic, time, includes, the, planck, epoch, during, which, currently, established, laws, of, physics, may, not, have, applied, the, emergence, in, stages, of, the, four, known, fundamental, interactions, or, forces, first, gravitation, and, later, the, electromagnetic, weak, and, strong, interactions, and, the, accelerated, expansion, of, the, universe, due, to, cosmic, inflation, tiny, ripples, in, the, universe, at, this, stage, are, believed, to, be, the, basis, of, large, scale, structures, that, formed, much, later, different, stages, of, the, very, early, universe, are, understood, to, different, extents, the, earlier, parts, are, beyond, the, grasp, of, practical, experiments, in, particle, physics, but, can, be, explored, through, the, extrapolation, of, known, physical, laws, to, extreme, high, temperatures, this, period, lasted, around, 370, 000, years, initially, various, kinds, of, subatomic, particles, are, formed, in, stages, these, particles, include, almost, equal, amounts, of, matter, and, antimatter, so, most, of, it, quickly, annihilates, leaving, a, small, excess, of, matter, in, the, universe, at, about, one, second, neutrinos, decouple, these, neutrinos, form, the, cosmic, neutrino, background, c, b, if, primordial, black, holes, exist, they, are, also, formed, at, about, one, second, of, cosmic, time, composite, subatomic, particles, emerge, including, protons, and, neutrons, and, from, about, 2, minutes, conditions, are, suitable, for, nucleosynthesis, around, 25, of, the, protons, and, all, the, neutrons, fuse, into, heavier, elements, initially, deuterium, which, itself, quickly, fuses, into, mainly, helium, 4, by, 20, minutes, the, universe, is, no, longer, hot, enough, for, nuclear, fusion, but, far, too, hot, for, neutral, atoms, to, exist, or, photons, to, travel, far, it, is, therefore, an, opaque, plasma, the, recombination, epoch, begins, at, around, 18, 000, years, as, electrons, are, combining, with, helium, nuclei, to, form, he, at, around, 47, 000, years, as, the, universe, cools, its, behavior, begins, to, be, dominated, by, matter, rather, than, radiation, at, around, 100, 000, years, after, the, neutral, helium, atoms, form, helium, hydride, is, the, first, molecule, much, later, hydrogen, and, helium, hydride, react, to, form, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, the, fuel, needed, for, the, first, stars, at, about, 370, 000, years, neutral, hydrogen, atoms, finish, forming, recombination, and, as, a, result, the, universe, also, became, transparent, for, the, first, time, the, newly, formed, atoms, mainly, hydrogen, and, helium, with, traces, of, lithium, quickly, reach, their, lowest, energy, state, ground, state, by, releasing, photons, photon, decoupling, and, these, photons, can, still, be, detected, today, as, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, this, is, the, oldest, direct, observation, we, currently, have, of, the, universe, this, period, measures, from, 370, 000, years, until, about, 1, billion, years, after, recombination, and, decoupling, the, universe, was, transparent, but, the, clouds, of, hydrogen, only, collapsed, very, slowly, to, form, stars, and, galaxies, so, there, were, no, new, sources, of, light, the, only, photons, electromagnetic, radiation, or, light, in, the, universe, were, those, released, during, decoupling, visible, today, as, the, cosmic, microwave, background, and, 21, cm, radio, emissions, occasionally, emitted, by, hydrogen, atoms, the, decoupled, photons, would, have, filled, the, universe, with, a, brilliant, pale, orange, glow, at, first, gradually, redshifting, to, non, visible, wavelengths, after, about, 3, million, years, leaving, it, without, visible, light, this, period, is, known, as, the, cosmic, dark, ages, at, some, point, around, 200, to, 500, million, years, the, earliest, generations, of, stars, and, galaxies, form, exact, timings, are, still, being, researched, and, early, large, structures, gradually, emerge, drawn, to, the, foam, like, dark, matter, filaments, which, have, already, begun, to, draw, together, throughout, the, universe, the, earliest, generations, of, stars, have, not, yet, been, observed, astronomically, they, may, have, been, huge, 100, 300, solar, masses, and, non, metallic, with, very, short, lifetimes, compared, to, most, stars, we, see, today, so, they, commonly, finish, burning, their, hydrogen, fuel, and, explode, as, highly, energetic, pair, instability, supernovae, after, mere, millions, of, years, other, theories, suggest, that, they, may, have, included, small, stars, some, perhaps, still, burning, today, in, either, case, these, early, generations, of, supernovae, created, most, of, the, everyday, elements, we, see, around, us, today, and, seeded, the, universe, with, them, galaxy, clusters, and, superclusters, emerge, over, time, at, some, point, high, energy, photons, from, the, earliest, stars, dwarf, galaxies, and, perhaps, quasars, leads, to, a, period, of, reionization, that, commences, gradually, between, about, 250, 500, million, years, and, finishes, by, about, 1, billion, years, exact, timings, still, being, researched, the, dark, ages, only, fully, came, to, an, end, at, about, 1, billion, years, as, the, universe, gradually, transitioned, into, the, universe, we, see, around, us, today, but, denser, hotter, more, intense, in, star, formation, and, more, rich, in, smaller, particularly, unbarred, spiral, and, irregular, galaxies, as, opposed, to, giant, elliptical, galaxies, while, early, stars, have, not, been, observed, galaxies, have, been, observed, from, 329, million, years, since, the, big, bang, with, jades, gs, z13, 0, which, the, james, webb, space, telescope, observed, with, a, redshift, of, z, 13, 2, from, 13, 4, billion, years, ago, the, jwst, was, designed, to, observe, as, far, as, z, 20, 180, million, years, cosmic, time, to, derive, the, age, of, the, universe, from, redshift, numeric, integration, or, its, closed, form, solution, involving, the, special, gaussian, hypergeometric, function, 2, f, 1, may, be, used, lookback, time, is, the, age, of, the, observation, subtracted, from, the, present, age, of, the, universe, from, 1, billion, years, and, for, about, 12, 8, billion, years, the, universe, has, looked, much, as, it, does, today, and, it, will, continue, to, appear, very, similar, for, many, billions, of, years, into, the, future, the, thin, disk, of, our, galaxy, began, to, form, at, about, 5, billion, years, 8, 8, gya, and, the, solar, system, formed, at, about, 9, 2, billion, years, 4, 6, gya, with, the, earliest, traces, of, life, on, earth, emerging, by, about, 10, 3, billion, years, 3, 5, gya, the, thinning, of, matter, over, time, reduces, the, ability, of, gravity, to, decelerate, the, expansion, of, the, universe, in, contrast, dark, energy, believed, to, be, a, constant, scalar, field, throughout, the, visible, universe, is, a, constant, factor, tending, to, accelerate, the, expansion, of, the, universe, the, universe, s, expansion, passed, an, inflection, point, about, five, or, six, billion, years, ago, when, the, universe, entered, the, modern, dark, energy, dominated, era, where, the, universe, s, expansion, is, now, accelerating, rather, than, decelerating, the, present, day, universe, is, understood, quite, well, but, beyond, about, 100, billion, years, of, cosmic, time, about, 86, billion, years, in, the, future, we, are, less, sure, which, path, the, universe, will, take, at, some, time, the, stelliferous, era, will, end, as, stars, are, no, longer, being, born, and, the, expansion, of, the, universe, will, mean, that, the, observable, universe, becomes, limited, to, local, galaxies, there, are, various, scenarios, for, the, far, future, and, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, more, exact, knowledge, of, the, present, day, universe, may, allow, these, to, be, better, understood, the, standard, model, of, cosmology, is, based, on, a, model, of, spacetime, called, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, flrw, metric, a, metric, provides, a, measure, of, distance, between, objects, and, the, flrw, metric, is, the, exact, solution, of, einstein, field, equations, efe, if, some, key, properties, of, space, such, as, homogeneity, and, isotropy, are, assumed, to, be, true, the, flrw, metric, very, closely, matches, overwhelming, other, evidence, showing, that, the, universe, has, expanded, since, the, big, bang, if, the, flrw, metric, equations, are, assumed, to, be, valid, all, the, way, back, to, the, beginning, of, the, universe, they, can, be, followed, back, in, time, to, a, point, where, the, equations, suggest, all, distances, between, objects, in, the, universe, were, zero, or, infinitesimally, small, this, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, the, universe, was, physically, small, at, the, big, bang, although, that, is, one, of, the, possibilities, this, provides, a, model, of, the, universe, which, matches, all, current, physical, observations, extremely, closely, this, initial, period, of, the, universe, s, chronology, is, called, the, big, bang, the, standard, model, of, cosmology, attempts, to, explain, how, the, universe, physically, developed, once, that, moment, happened, the, singularity, from, the, flrw, metric, is, interpreted, to, mean, that, current, theories, are, inadequate, to, describe, what, actually, happened, at, the, start, of, the, big, bang, itself, it, is, widely, believed, that, a, correct, theory, of, quantum, gravity, may, allow, a, more, correct, description, of, that, event, but, no, such, theory, has, yet, been, developed, after, that, moment, all, distances, throughout, the, universe, began, to, increase, from, perhaps, zero, because, the, flrw, metric, itself, changed, over, time, affecting, distances, between, all, non, bound, objects, everywhere, for, this, reason, it, is, said, that, the, big, bang, happened, everywhere, during, the, earliest, moments, of, cosmic, time, the, energies, and, conditions, were, so, extreme, that, current, knowledge, can, only, suggest, possibilities, which, may, turn, out, to, be, incorrect, to, give, one, example, eternal, inflation, theories, propose, that, inflation, lasts, forever, throughout, most, of, the, universe, making, the, notion, of, n, seconds, since, big, bang, ill, defined, therefore, the, earliest, stages, are, an, active, area, of, research, and, based, on, ideas, that, are, still, speculative, and, subject, to, modification, as, scientific, knowledge, improves, although, a, specific, inflationary, epoch, is, highlighted, at, around, 10, 32, seconds, observations, and, theories, both, suggest, that, distances, between, objects, in, space, have, been, increasing, at, all, times, since, the, moment, of, the, big, bang, and, are, still, increasing, with, the, exception, of, gravitationally, bound, objects, such, as, galaxies, and, most, clusters, once, the, rate, of, expansion, had, greatly, slowed, the, inflationary, period, marks, a, specific, period, when, a, very, rapid, change, in, scale, occurred, but, does, not, mean, that, it, stayed, the, same, at, other, times, more, precisely, during, inflation, the, expansion, accelerated, after, inflation, and, for, about, 9, 8, billion, years, the, expansion, was, much, slower, and, became, slower, yet, over, time, although, it, never, reversed, about, 4, billion, years, ago, it, began, slightly, speeding, up, again, the, planck, epoch, is, an, era, in, traditional, non, inflationary, big, bang, cosmology, immediately, after, the, event, which, began, the, known, universe, during, this, epoch, the, temperature, and, average, energies, within, the, universe, were, so, high, that, subatomic, particles, could, not, form, the, four, fundamental, forces, that, shape, the, universe, gravitation, electromagnetism, the, weak, nuclear, force, and, the, strong, nuclear, force, comprised, a, single, fundamental, force, little, is, understood, about, physics, in, this, environment, traditional, big, bang, cosmology, predicts, a, gravitational, singularity, a, condition, in, which, spacetime, breaks, down, before, this, time, but, the, theory, relies, on, the, theory, of, general, relativity, which, is, thought, to, break, down, for, this, epoch, due, to, quantum, effects, in, inflationary, models, of, cosmology, times, before, the, end, of, inflation, roughly, 10, 32, seconds, after, the, big, bang, do, not, follow, the, same, timeline, as, in, traditional, big, bang, cosmology, models, that, aim, to, describe, the, universe, and, physics, during, the, planck, epoch, are, generally, speculative, and, fall, under, the, umbrella, of, new, physics, examples, include, the, hartle, hawking, initial, state, string, theory, landscape, string, gas, cosmology, and, the, ekpyrotic, universe, as, the, universe, expanded, and, cooled, it, crossed, transition, temperatures, at, which, forces, separated, from, each, other, these, cosmological, phase, transitions, can, be, visualized, as, similar, to, condensation, and, freezing, phase, transitions, of, ordinary, matter, at, certain, temperatures, energies, water, molecules, change, their, behavior, and, structure, and, they, will, behave, completely, differently, like, steam, turning, to, water, the, fields, which, define, the, universe, s, fundamental, forces, and, particles, also, completely, change, their, behaviors, and, structures, when, the, temperature, energy, falls, below, a, certain, point, this, is, not, apparent, in, everyday, life, because, it, only, happens, at, far, higher, temperatures, than, usually, seen, in, the, present, day, universe, these, phase, transitions, in, the, universe, s, fundamental, forces, are, believed, to, be, caused, by, a, phenomenon, of, quantum, fields, called, symmetry, breaking, in, everyday, terms, as, the, universe, cools, it, becomes, possible, for, the, quantum, fields, that, create, the, forces, and, particles, around, us, to, settle, at, lower, energy, levels, and, with, higher, levels, of, stability, in, doing, so, they, completely, shift, how, they, interact, forces, and, interactions, arise, due, to, these, fields, so, the, universe, can, behave, very, differently, above, and, below, a, phase, transition, for, example, in, a, later, epoch, a, side, effect, of, one, phase, transition, is, that, suddenly, many, particles, that, had, no, mass, at, all, acquire, a, mass, they, begin, to, interact, differently, with, the, higgs, field, and, a, single, force, begins, to, manifest, as, two, separate, forces, assuming, that, nature, is, described, by, a, so, called, grand, unified, theory, gut, the, grand, unification, epoch, began, with, a, phase, transition, of, this, kind, when, gravitation, separated, from, the, universal, combined, gauge, force, this, caused, two, forces, to, now, exist, gravity, and, an, electrostrong, interaction, there, is, no, hard, evidence, yet, that, such, a, combined, force, existed, but, many, physicists, believe, it, did, the, physics, of, this, electrostrong, interaction, would, be, described, by, a, grand, unified, theory, the, grand, unification, epoch, ended, with, a, second, phase, transition, as, the, electrostrong, interaction, in, turn, separated, and, began, to, manifest, as, two, separate, interactions, called, the, strong, and, the, electroweak, interactions, depending, on, how, epochs, are, defined, and, the, model, being, followed, the, electroweak, epoch, may, be, considered, to, start, before, or, after, the, inflationary, epoch, in, some, models, it, is, described, as, including, the, inflationary, epoch, in, other, models, the, electroweak, epoch, is, said, to, begin, after, the, inflationary, epoch, ended, at, roughly, 10, 32, seconds, according, to, traditional, big, bang, cosmology, the, electroweak, epoch, began, 10, 36, seconds, after, the, big, bang, when, the, temperature, of, the, universe, was, low, enough, 10, 28, k, for, the, electronuclear, force, to, begin, to, manifest, as, two, separate, interactions, the, strong, and, the, electroweak, interactions, the, electroweak, interaction, will, also, separate, later, dividing, into, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, interactions, the, exact, point, where, electrostrong, symmetry, was, broken, is, not, certain, owing, to, speculative, and, as, yet, incomplete, theoretical, knowledge, at, this, point, of, the, very, early, universe, the, universe, is, thought, to, have, expanded, by, a, factor, of, at, least, 10, 78, in, volume, this, is, equivalent, to, a, linear, increase, of, at, least, 10, 26, times, in, every, spatial, dimension, equivalent, to, an, object, 1, nanometre, 10, 9, m, about, half, the, width, of, a, molecule, of, dna, in, length, expanding, to, one, approximately, 10, 6, light, years, 100, trillion, kilometres, long, in, a, tiny, fraction, of, a, second, this, phase, of, the, cosmic, expansion, history, is, known, as, inflation, the, mechanism, that, drove, inflation, remains, unknown, although, many, models, have, been, put, forward, in, several, of, the, more, prominent, models, it, is, thought, to, have, been, triggered, by, the, separation, of, the, strong, and, electroweak, interactions, which, ended, the, grand, unification, epoch, one, of, the, theoretical, products, of, this, phase, transition, was, a, scalar, field, called, the, inflaton, field, as, this, field, settled, into, its, lowest, energy, state, throughout, the, universe, it, generated, an, enormous, repulsive, force, that, led, to, a, rapid, expansion, of, universe, inflation, explains, several, observed, properties, of, the, current, universe, that, are, otherwise, difficult, to, account, for, including, explaining, how, today, s, universe, has, ended, up, so, exceedingly, homogeneous, spatially, uniform, on, a, very, large, scale, even, though, it, was, highly, disordered, in, its, earliest, stages, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, the, inflationary, epoch, ended, but, it, is, thought, to, have, been, between, 10, 33, and, 10, 32, seconds, after, the, big, bang, the, rapid, expansion, of, space, meant, that, elementary, particles, remaining, from, the, grand, unification, epoch, were, now, distributed, very, thinly, across, the, universe, however, the, huge, potential, energy, of, the, inflaton, field, was, released, at, the, end, of, the, inflationary, epoch, as, the, inflaton, field, decayed, into, other, particles, known, as, reheating, this, heating, effect, led, to, the, universe, being, repopulated, with, a, dense, hot, mixture, of, quarks, anti, quarks, and, gluons, in, other, models, reheating, is, often, considered, to, mark, the, start, of, the, electroweak, epoch, and, some, theories, such, as, warm, inflation, avoid, a, reheating, phase, entirely, in, non, traditional, versions, of, big, bang, theory, known, as, inflationary, models, inflation, ended, at, a, temperature, corresponding, to, roughly, 10, 32, seconds, after, the, big, bang, but, this, does, not, imply, that, the, inflationary, era, lasted, less, than, 10, 32, seconds, to, explain, the, observed, homogeneity, of, the, universe, the, duration, in, these, models, must, be, longer, than, 10, 32, seconds, therefore, in, inflationary, cosmology, the, earliest, meaningful, time, after, the, big, bang, is, the, time, of, the, end, of, inflation, after, inflation, ended, the, universe, continued, to, expand, but, at, a, decelerating, rate, about, 4, billion, years, ago, the, expansion, gradually, began, to, speed, up, again, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, dark, energy, becoming, dominant, in, the, universe, s, large, scale, behavior, it, is, still, expanding, today, on, 17, march, 2014, astrophysicists, of, the, bicep2, collaboration, announced, the, detection, of, inflationary, gravitational, waves, in, the, b, modes, power, spectrum, which, was, interpreted, as, clear, experimental, evidence, for, the, theory, of, inflation, however, on, 19, june, 2014, lowered, confidence, in, confirming, the, cosmic, inflation, findings, was, reported, and, finally, on, 2, february, 2015, a, joint, analysis, of, data, from, bicep2, keck, and, the, european, space, agency, s, planck, microwave, space, telescope, concluded, that, the, statistical, significance, is, too, low, to, be, interpreted, as, a, detection, of, primordial, b, modes, and, can, be, attributed, mainly, to, polarized, dust, in, the, milky, way, if, supersymmetry, is, a, property, of, the, universe, then, it, must, be, broken, at, an, energy, that, is, no, lower, than, 1, tev, the, electroweak, scale, the, masses, of, particles, and, their, superpartners, would, then, no, longer, be, equal, this, very, high, energy, could, explain, why, no, superpartners, of, known, particles, have, ever, been, observed, after, cosmic, inflation, ends, the, universe, is, filled, with, a, hot, quark, gluon, plasma, the, remains, of, reheating, from, this, point, onwards, the, physics, of, the, early, universe, is, much, better, understood, and, the, energies, involved, in, the, quark, epoch, are, directly, accessible, in, particle, physics, experiments, and, other, detectors, some, time, after, inflation, the, created, particles, went, through, thermalization, where, mutual, interactions, lead, to, thermal, equilibrium, the, earliest, stage, that, we, are, confident, about, is, some, time, before, the, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, at, a, temperature, of, around, 10, 15, k, approximately, 10, 15, seconds, after, the, big, bang, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, interaction, have, not, yet, separated, and, the, gauge, bosons, and, fermions, have, not, yet, gained, mass, through, the, higgs, mechanism, however, exotic, massive, particle, like, entities, sphalerons, are, thought, to, have, existed, this, epoch, ended, with, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, potentially, through, a, phase, transition, in, some, extensions, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, baryogenesis, also, happened, at, this, stage, creating, an, imbalance, between, matter, and, anti, matter, though, in, extensions, to, this, model, this, may, have, happened, earlier, little, is, known, about, the, details, of, these, processes, the, number, density, of, each, particle, species, was, by, a, similar, analysis, to, stefan, boltzmann, law, which, is, roughly, just, k, b, t, c, 3, displaystyle, k, b, t, hbar, c, 3, since, the, interaction, was, strong, the, cross, section, displaystyle, sigma, was, approximately, the, particle, wavelength, squared, which, is, roughly, n, 2, 3, displaystyle, n, 2, 3, the, rate, of, collisions, per, particle, species, can, thus, be, calculated, from, the, mean, free, path, giving, approximately, for, comparison, since, the, cosmological, constant, was, negligible, at, this, stage, the, hubble, parameter, was, where, x, 10, 2, was, the, number, of, available, particle, species, thus, h, is, orders, of, magnitude, lower, than, the, rate, of, collisions, per, particle, species, this, means, there, was, plenty, of, time, for, thermalization, at, this, stage, at, this, epoch, the, collision, rate, is, proportional, to, the, third, root, of, the, number, density, and, thus, to, a, 1, displaystyle, a, 1, where, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, scale, parameter, the, hubble, parameter, however, is, proportional, to, a, 2, displaystyle, a, 2, going, back, in, time, and, higher, in, energy, and, assuming, no, new, physics, at, these, energies, a, careful, estimate, gives, that, thermalization, was, first, possible, when, the, temperature, was, approximately, 10, 22, seconds, after, the, big, bang, as, the, universe, s, temperature, continued, to, fall, below, 159, 5, 1, 5, gev, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, happened, so, far, as, we, know, it, was, the, penultimate, symmetry, breaking, event, in, the, formation, of, the, universe, the, final, one, being, chiral, symmetry, breaking, in, the, quark, sector, this, has, two, related, effects, after, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, the, fundamental, interactions, we, know, of, gravitation, electromagnetic, weak, and, strong, interactions, have, all, taken, their, present, forms, and, fundamental, particles, have, their, expected, masses, but, the, temperature, of, the, universe, is, still, too, high, to, allow, the, stable, formation, of, many, particles, we, now, see, in, the, universe, so, there, are, no, protons, or, neutrons, and, therefore, no, atoms, atomic, nuclei, or, molecules, more, exactly, any, composite, particles, that, form, by, chance, almost, immediately, break, up, again, due, to, the, extreme, energies, the, quark, epoch, began, approximately, 10, 12, seconds, after, the, big, bang, this, was, the, period, in, the, evolution, of, the, early, universe, immediately, after, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, when, the, fundamental, interactions, of, gravitation, electromagnetism, the, strong, interaction, and, the, weak, interaction, had, taken, their, present, forms, but, the, temperature, of, the, universe, was, still, too, high, to, allow, quarks, to, bind, together, to, form, hadrons, during, the, quark, epoch, the, universe, was, filled, with, a, dense, hot, quark, gluon, plasma, containing, quarks, leptons, and, their, antiparticles, collisions, between, particles, were, too, energetic, to, allow, quarks, to, combine, into, mesons, or, baryons, the, quark, epoch, ended, when, the, universe, was, about, 10, 5, seconds, old, when, the, average, energy, of, particle, interactions, had, fallen, below, the, mass, of, the, lightest, hadron, the, pion, baryons, are, subatomic, particles, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, that, are, composed, of, three, quarks, it, would, be, expected, that, both, baryons, and, particles, known, as, antibaryons, would, have, formed, in, equal, numbers, however, this, does, not, seem, to, be, what, happened, as, far, as, we, know, the, universe, was, left, with, far, more, baryons, than, antibaryons, in, fact, almost, no, antibaryons, are, observed, in, nature, it, is, not, clear, how, this, came, about, any, explanation, for, this, phenomenon, must, allow, the, sakharov, conditions, related, to, baryogenesis, to, have, been, satisfied, at, some, time, after, the, end, of, cosmological, inflation, current, particle, physics, suggests, asymmetries, under, which, these, conditions, would, be, met, but, these, asymmetries, appear, to, be, too, small, to, account, for, the, observed, baryon, antibaryon, asymmetry, of, the, universe, the, quark, gluon, plasma, that, composes, the, universe, cools, until, hadrons, including, baryons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, can, form, initially, hadron, anti, hadron, pairs, could, form, so, matter, and, antimatter, were, in, thermal, equilibrium, however, as, the, temperature, of, the, universe, continued, to, fall, new, hadron, anti, hadron, pairs, were, no, longer, produced, and, most, of, the, newly, formed, hadrons, and, anti, hadrons, annihilated, each, other, giving, rise, to, pairs, of, high, energy, photons, a, comparatively, small, residue, of, hadrons, remained, at, about, 1, second, of, cosmic, time, when, this, epoch, ended, theory, predicts, that, about, 1, neutron, remained, for, every, 6, protons, with, the, ratio, falling, to, 1, 7, over, time, due, to, neutron, decay, this, is, believed, to, be, correct, because, at, a, later, stage, the, neutrons, and, some, of, the, protons, fused, leaving, hydrogen, a, hydrogen, isotope, called, deuterium, helium, and, other, elements, which, can, be, measured, a, 1, 7, ratio, of, hadrons, would, indeed, produce, the, observed, element, ratios, in, the, early, and, current, universe, at, approximately, 1, second, after, the, big, bang, neutrinos, decouple, and, begin, travelling, freely, through, space, as, neutrinos, rarely, interact, with, matter, these, neutrinos, still, exist, today, analogous, to, the, much, later, cosmic, microwave, background, emitted, during, recombination, around, 370, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, the, neutrinos, from, this, event, have, a, very, low, energy, around, 10, 10, times, the, amount, of, those, observable, with, present, day, direct, detection, even, high, energy, neutrinos, are, notoriously, difficult, to, detect, so, this, cosmic, neutrino, background, c, b, may, not, be, directly, observed, in, detail, for, many, years, if, at, all, however, big, bang, cosmology, makes, many, predictions, about, the, c, b, and, there, is, very, strong, indirect, evidence, that, the, c, b, exists, both, from, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, predictions, of, the, helium, abundance, and, from, anisotropies, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, one, of, these, predictions, is, that, neutrinos, will, have, left, a, subtle, imprint, on, the, cmb, it, is, well, known, that, the, cmb, has, irregularities, some, of, the, cmb, fluctuations, were, roughly, regularly, spaced, because, of, the, effect, of, baryonic, acoustic, oscillations, in, theory, the, decoupled, neutrinos, should, have, had, a, very, slight, effect, on, the, phase, of, the, various, cmb, fluctuations, in, 2015, it, was, reported, that, such, shifts, had, been, detected, in, the, cmb, moreover, the, fluctuations, corresponded, to, neutrinos, of, almost, exactly, the, temperature, predicted, by, big, bang, theory, 1, 96, 0, 02k, compared, to, a, prediction, of, 1, 95k, and, exactly, three, types, of, neutrino, the, same, number, of, neutrino, flavors, predicted, by, the, standard, model, primordial, black, holes, are, a, hypothetical, type, of, black, hole, proposed, in, 1966, that, may, have, formed, during, the, so, called, radiation, dominated, era, due, to, the, high, densities, and, inhomogeneous, conditions, within, the, first, second, of, cosmic, time, random, fluctuations, could, lead, to, some, regions, becoming, dense, enough, to, undergo, gravitational, collapse, forming, black, holes, current, understandings, and, theories, place, tight, limits, on, the, abundance, and, mass, of, these, objects, typically, primordial, black, hole, formation, requires, density, contrasts, regional, variations, in, the, universe, s, density, of, around, 0, 1, displaystyle, delta, rho, rho, sim, 0, 1, 10, where, displaystyle, rho, is, the, average, density, of, the, universe, several, mechanisms, could, produce, dense, regions, meeting, this, criterion, during, the, early, universe, including, reheating, cosmological, phase, transitions, and, in, so, called, hybrid, inflation, models, axion, inflation, since, primordial, black, holes, didn, t, form, from, stellar, gravitational, collapse, their, masses, can, be, far, below, stellar, mass, 2, 10, 33, g, stephen, hawking, calculated, in, 1971, that, primordial, black, holes, could, have, a, mass, as, small, as, 10, 5, g, but, they, can, have, any, size, so, they, could, also, be, large, and, may, have, contributed, to, the, formation, of, galaxies, the, majority, of, hadrons, and, anti, hadrons, annihilate, each, other, at, the, end, of, the, hadron, epoch, leaving, leptons, such, as, the, electron, muons, and, certain, neutrinos, and, antileptons, dominating, the, mass, of, the, universe, the, lepton, epoch, follows, a, similar, path, to, the, earlier, hadron, epoch, initially, leptons, and, antileptons, are, produced, in, pairs, about, 10, seconds, after, the, big, bang, the, temperature, of, the, universe, falls, to, the, point, at, which, new, lepton, antilepton, pairs, are, no, longer, created, and, most, remaining, leptons, and, antileptons, quickly, annihilated, each, other, giving, rise, to, pairs, of, high, energy, photons, and, leaving, a, small, residue, of, non, annihilated, leptons, after, most, leptons, and, antileptons, are, annihilated, at, the, end, of, the, lepton, epoch, most, of, the, mass, energy, in, the, universe, is, left, in, the, form, of, photons, much, of, the, rest, of, its, mass, energy, is, in, the, form, of, neutrinos, and, other, relativistic, particles, therefore, the, energy, of, the, universe, and, its, overall, behavior, is, dominated, by, its, photons, these, photons, continue, to, interact, frequently, with, charged, particles, i, e, electrons, protons, and, eventually, nuclei, they, continue, to, do, so, for, about, the, next, 370, 000, years, between, about, 2, and, 20, minutes, after, the, big, bang, the, temperature, and, pressure, of, the, universe, allowed, nuclear, fusion, to, occur, giving, rise, to, nuclei, of, a, few, light, elements, beyond, hydrogen, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, about, 25, of, the, protons, and, all, the, neutrons, fuse, to, form, deuterium, a, hydrogen, isotope, and, most, of, the, deuterium, quickly, fuses, to, form, helium, 4, atomic, nuclei, will, easily, unbind, break, apart, above, a, certain, temperature, related, to, their, binding, energy, from, about, 2, minutes, the, falling, temperature, means, that, deuterium, no, longer, unbinds, and, is, stable, and, starting, from, about, 3, minutes, helium, and, other, elements, formed, by, the, fusion, of, deuterium, also, no, longer, unbind, and, are, stable, the, short, duration, and, falling, temperature, means, that, only, the, simplest, and, fastest, fusion, processes, can, occur, only, tiny, amounts, of, nuclei, beyond, helium, are, formed, because, nucleosynthesis, of, heavier, elements, is, difficult, and, requires, thousands, of, years, even, in, stars, small, amounts, of, tritium, another, hydrogen, isotope, and, beryllium, 7, and, 8, are, formed, but, these, are, unstable, and, are, quickly, lost, again, a, small, amount, of, deuterium, is, left, unfused, because, of, the, very, short, duration, therefore, the, only, stable, nuclides, created, by, the, end, of, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, are, protium, single, proton, hydrogen, nucleus, deuterium, helium, 3, helium, 4, and, lithium, 7, by, mass, the, resulting, matter, is, about, 75, hydrogen, nuclei, 25, helium, nuclei, and, perhaps, 10, 10, by, mass, of, lithium, 7, the, next, most, common, stable, isotopes, produced, are, lithium, 6, beryllium, 9, boron, 11, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, cno, but, these, have, predicted, abundances, of, between, 5, and, 30, parts, in, 10, 15, by, mass, making, them, essentially, undetectable, and, negligible, the, amounts, of, each, light, element, in, the, early, universe, can, be, estimated, from, old, galaxies, and, is, strong, evidence, for, the, big, bang, for, example, the, big, bang, should, produce, about, 1, neutron, for, every, 7, protons, allowing, for, 25, of, all, nucleons, to, be, fused, into, helium, 4, 2, protons, and, 2, neutrons, out, of, every, 16, nucleons, and, this, is, the, amount, we, find, today, and, far, more, than, can, be, easily, explained, by, other, processes, similarly, deuterium, fuses, extremely, easily, any, alternative, explanation, must, also, explain, how, conditions, existed, for, deuterium, to, form, but, also, left, some, of, that, deuterium, unfused, and, not, immediately, fused, again, into, helium, any, alternative, must, also, explain, the, proportions, of, the, various, light, elements, and, their, isotopes, a, few, isotopes, such, as, lithium, 7, were, found, to, be, present, in, amounts, that, differed, from, theory, but, over, time, these, differences, have, been, resolved, by, better, observations, until, now, the, universe, s, large, scale, dynamics, and, behavior, have, been, determined, mainly, by, radiation, meaning, those, constituents, that, move, relativistically, at, or, near, the, speed, of, light, such, as, photons, and, neutrinos, as, the, universe, cools, from, around, 47, 000, years, redshift, z, 3600, the, universe, s, large, scale, behavior, becomes, dominated, by, matter, instead, this, occurs, because, the, energy, density, of, matter, begins, to, exceed, both, the, energy, density, of, radiation, and, the, vacuum, energy, density, around, or, shortly, after, 47, 000, years, the, densities, of, non, relativistic, matter, atomic, nuclei, and, relativistic, radiation, photons, become, equal, the, jeans, length, which, determines, the, smallest, structures, that, can, form, due, to, competition, between, gravitational, attraction, and, pressure, effects, begins, to, fall, and, perturbations, instead, of, being, wiped, out, by, free, streaming, radiation, can, begin, to, grow, in, amplitude, according, to, the, lambda, cdm, model, by, this, stage, the, matter, in, the, universe, is, around, 84, 5, cold, dark, matter, and, 15, 5, ordinary, matter, there, is, overwhelming, evidence, that, dark, matter, exists, and, dominates, the, universe, but, since, the, exact, nature, of, dark, matter, is, still, not, understood, the, big, bang, theory, does, not, presently, cover, any, stages, in, its, formation, from, this, point, on, and, for, several, billion, years, to, come, the, presence, of, dark, matter, accelerates, the, formation, of, structure, in, the, universe, in, the, early, universe, dark, matter, gradually, gathers, in, huge, filaments, under, the, effects, of, gravity, collapsing, faster, than, ordinary, baryonic, matter, because, its, collapse, is, not, slowed, by, radiation, pressure, this, amplifies, the, tiny, inhomogeneities, irregularities, in, the, density, of, the, universe, which, was, left, by, cosmic, inflation, over, time, slightly, denser, regions, become, denser, and, slightly, rarefied, emptier, regions, become, more, rarefied, ordinary, matter, eventually, gathers, together, faster, than, it, would, otherwise, do, because, of, the, presence, of, these, concentrations, of, dark, matter, the, properties, of, dark, matter, that, allow, it, to, collapse, quickly, without, radiation, pressure, also, mean, that, it, cannot, lose, energy, by, radiation, either, losing, energy, is, necessary, for, particles, to, collapse, into, dense, structures, beyond, a, certain, point, therefore, dark, matter, collapses, into, huge, but, diffuse, filaments, and, haloes, and, not, into, stars, or, planets, ordinary, matter, which, can, lose, energy, by, radiation, forms, dense, objects, and, also, gas, clouds, when, it, collapses, about, 370, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, two, connected, events, occurred, the, ending, of, recombination, and, photon, decoupling, recombination, describes, the, ionized, particles, combining, to, form, the, first, neutral, atoms, and, decoupling, refers, to, the, photons, released, decoupled, as, the, newly, formed, atoms, settle, into, more, stable, energy, states, just, before, recombination, the, baryonic, matter, in, the, universe, was, at, a, temperature, where, it, formed, a, hot, ionized, plasma, most, of, the, photons, in, the, universe, interacted, with, electrons, and, protons, and, could, not, travel, significant, distances, without, interacting, with, ionized, particles, as, a, result, the, universe, was, opaque, or, foggy, although, there, was, light, it, was, not, possible, to, see, nor, can, we, observe, that, light, through, telescopes, starting, around, 18, 000, years, the, universe, has, cooled, to, a, point, where, free, electrons, can, combine, with, helium, nuclei, to, form, he, atoms, neutral, helium, nuclei, then, start, to, form, at, around, 100, 000, years, with, neutral, hydrogen, formation, peaking, around, 260, 000, years, this, process, is, known, as, recombination, the, name, is, slightly, inaccurate, and, is, given, for, historical, reasons, in, fact, the, electrons, and, atomic, nuclei, were, combining, for, the, first, time, at, around, 100, 000, years, the, universe, had, cooled, enough, for, helium, hydride, the, first, molecule, to, form, in, april, 2019, this, molecule, was, first, announced, to, have, been, observed, in, interstellar, space, in, ngc, 7027, a, planetary, nebula, within, this, galaxy, much, later, atomic, hydrogen, reacted, with, helium, hydride, to, create, molecular, hydrogen, the, fuel, required, for, star, formation, directly, combining, in, a, low, energy, state, ground, state, is, less, efficient, so, these, hydrogen, atoms, generally, form, with, the, electrons, still, in, a, high, energy, state, and, once, combined, the, electrons, quickly, release, energy, in, the, form, of, one, or, more, photons, as, they, transition, to, a, low, energy, state, this, release, of, photons, is, known, as, photon, decoupling, some, of, these, decoupled, photons, are, captured, by, other, hydrogen, atoms, the, remainder, remain, free, by, the, end, of, recombination, most, of, the, protons, in, the, universe, have, formed, neutral, atoms, this, change, from, charged, to, neutral, particles, means, that, the, mean, free, path, photons, can, travel, before, capture, in, effect, becomes, infinite, so, any, decoupled, photons, that, have, not, been, captured, can, travel, freely, over, long, distances, see, thomson, scattering, the, universe, has, become, transparent, to, visible, light, radio, waves, and, other, electromagnetic, radiation, for, the, first, time, in, its, history, the, photons, released, by, these, newly, formed, hydrogen, atoms, initially, had, a, temperature, energy, of, around, 4000, k, this, would, have, been, visible, to, the, eye, as, a, pale, yellow, orange, tinted, or, soft, white, color, over, billions, of, years, since, decoupling, as, the, universe, has, expanded, the, photons, have, been, red, shifted, from, visible, light, to, radio, waves, microwave, radiation, corresponding, to, a, temperature, of, about, 2, 7, k, red, shifting, describes, the, photons, acquiring, longer, wavelengths, and, lower, frequencies, as, the, universe, expanded, over, billions, of, years, so, that, they, gradually, changed, from, visible, light, to, radio, waves, these, same, photons, can, still, be, detected, as, radio, waves, today, they, form, the, cosmic, microwave, background, and, they, provide, crucial, evidence, of, the, early, universe, and, how, it, developed, around, the, same, time, as, recombination, existing, pressure, waves, within, the, electron, baryon, plasma, known, as, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, became, embedded, in, the, distribution, of, matter, as, it, condensed, giving, rise, to, a, very, slight, preference, in, distribution, of, large, scale, objects, therefore, the, cosmic, microwave, background, is, a, picture, of, the, universe, at, the, end, of, this, epoch, including, the, tiny, fluctuations, generated, during, inflation, see, 9, year, wmap, image, and, the, spread, of, objects, such, as, galaxies, in, the, universe, is, an, indication, of, the, scale, and, size, of, the, universe, as, it, developed, over, time, after, recombination, and, decoupling, the, universe, was, transparent, and, had, cooled, enough, to, allow, light, to, travel, long, distances, but, there, were, no, light, producing, structures, such, as, stars, and, galaxies, stars, and, galaxies, are, formed, when, dense, regions, of, gas, form, due, to, the, action, of, gravity, and, this, takes, a, long, time, within, a, near, uniform, density, of, gas, and, on, the, scale, required, so, it, is, estimated, that, stars, did, not, exist, for, perhaps, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, after, recombination, this, period, known, as, the, dark, ages, began, around, 370, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, during, the, dark, ages, the, temperature, of, the, universe, cooled, from, some, 4000, k, to, about, 60, k, 3727, c, to, about, 213, c, and, only, two, sources, of, photons, existed, the, photons, released, during, recombination, decoupling, as, neutral, hydrogen, atoms, formed, which, we, can, still, detect, today, as, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, and, photons, occasionally, released, by, neutral, hydrogen, atoms, known, as, the, 21, cm, spin, line, of, neutral, hydrogen, the, hydrogen, spin, line, is, in, the, microwave, range, of, frequencies, and, within, 3, million, years, the, cmb, photons, had, redshifted, out, of, visible, light, to, infrared, from, that, time, until, the, first, stars, there, were, no, visible, light, photons, other, than, perhaps, some, rare, statistical, anomalies, the, universe, was, truly, dark, the, first, generation, of, stars, known, as, population, iii, stars, formed, within, a, few, hundred, million, years, after, the, big, bang, these, stars, were, the, first, source, of, visible, light, in, the, universe, after, recombination, structures, may, have, begun, to, emerge, from, around, 150, million, years, and, early, galaxies, emerged, from, around, 180, to, 700, million, years, as, they, emerged, the, dark, ages, gradually, ended, because, this, process, was, gradual, the, dark, ages, only, ended, fully, at, around, 1, billion, years, as, the, universe, took, on, its, present, appearance, at, present, the, oldest, observations, of, stars, and, galaxies, are, from, shortly, after, the, start, of, reionization, with, galaxies, such, as, gn, z11, hubble, space, telescope, 2016, at, about, z, 11, 1, about, 400, million, years, cosmic, time, hubble, s, successor, the, james, webb, space, telescope, launched, december, 2021, is, designed, to, detect, objects, up, to, 100, times, fainter, than, hubble, and, much, earlier, in, the, history, of, the, universe, back, to, redshift, z, 20, about, 180, million, years, cosmic, time, this, is, believed, to, be, earlier, than, the, first, galaxies, and, around, the, era, of, the, first, stars, there, is, also, an, observational, effort, underway, to, detect, the, faint, 21, cm, spin, line, radiation, as, it, is, in, principle, an, even, more, powerful, tool, than, the, cosmic, microwave, background, for, studying, the, early, universe, the, matter, in, the, universe, is, around, 84, 5, cold, dark, matter, and, 15, 5, ordinary, matter, since, the, start, of, the, matter, dominated, era, dark, matter, has, gradually, been, gathering, in, huge, spread, out, diffuse, filaments, under, the, effects, of, gravity, ordinary, matter, eventually, gathers, together, faster, than, it, would, otherwise, do, because, of, the, presence, of, these, concentrations, of, dark, matter, it, is, also, slightly, more, dense, at, regular, distances, due, to, early, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, bao, which, became, embedded, into, the, distribution, of, matter, when, photons, decoupled, unlike, dark, matter, ordinary, matter, can, lose, energy, by, many, routes, which, means, that, as, it, collapses, it, can, lose, the, energy, which, would, otherwise, hold, it, apart, and, collapse, more, quickly, and, into, denser, forms, ordinary, matter, gathers, where, dark, matter, is, denser, and, in, those, places, it, collapses, into, clouds, of, mainly, hydrogen, gas, the, first, stars, and, galaxies, form, from, these, clouds, where, numerous, galaxies, have, formed, galaxy, clusters, and, superclusters, will, eventually, arise, large, voids, with, few, stars, will, develop, between, them, marking, where, dark, matter, became, less, common, the, exact, timings, of, the, first, stars, galaxies, supermassive, black, holes, and, quasars, and, the, start, and, end, timings, and, progression, of, the, period, known, as, reionization, are, still, being, actively, researched, with, new, findings, published, periodically, as, of, 2019, the, earliest, confirmed, galaxies, for, example, gn, z11, date, from, around, 380, 400, million, years, suggesting, surprisingly, fast, gas, cloud, condensation, and, stellar, birth, rates, and, observations, of, the, lyman, alpha, forest, and, of, other, changes, to, the, light, from, ancient, objects, allow, the, timing, for, reionization, and, its, eventual, end, to, be, narrowed, down, but, these, are, all, still, areas, of, active, research, structure, formation, in, the, big, bang, model, proceeds, hierarchically, due, to, gravitational, collapse, with, smaller, structures, forming, before, larger, ones, the, earliest, structures, to, form, are, the, first, stars, known, as, population, iii, stars, dwarf, galaxies, and, quasars, which, are, thought, to, be, bright, early, active, galaxies, containing, a, supermassive, black, hole, surrounded, by, an, inward, spiralling, accretion, disk, of, gas, before, this, epoch, the, evolution, of, the, universe, could, be, understood, through, linear, cosmological, perturbation, theory, that, is, all, structures, could, be, understood, as, small, deviations, from, a, perfect, homogeneous, universe, this, is, computationally, relatively, easy, to, study, at, this, point, non, linear, structures, begin, to, form, and, the, computational, problem, becomes, much, more, difficult, involving, for, example, n, body, simulations, with, billions, of, particles, the, bolshoi, cosmological, simulation, is, a, high, precision, simulation, of, this, era, these, population, iii, stars, are, also, responsible, for, turning, the, few, light, elements, that, were, formed, in, the, big, bang, hydrogen, helium, and, small, amounts, of, lithium, into, many, heavier, elements, they, can, be, huge, as, well, as, perhaps, small, and, non, metallic, no, elements, except, hydrogen, and, helium, the, larger, stars, have, very, short, lifetimes, compared, to, most, main, sequence, stars, we, see, today, so, they, commonly, finish, burning, their, hydrogen, fuel, and, explode, as, supernovae, after, mere, millions, of, years, seeding, the, universe, with, heavier, elements, over, repeated, generations, they, mark, the, start, of, the, stelliferous, era, as, yet, no, population, iii, stars, have, been, found, so, the, understanding, of, them, is, based, on, computational, models, of, their, formation, and, evolution, fortunately, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, can, be, used, to, date, when, star, formation, began, in, earnest, analysis, of, such, observations, made, by, the, planck, microwave, space, telescope, in, 2016, concluded, that, the, first, generation, of, stars, may, have, formed, from, around, 300, million, years, after, the, big, bang, the, october, 2010, discovery, of, udfy, 38135539, the, first, observed, galaxy, to, have, existed, during, the, following, reionization, epoch, gives, us, a, window, into, these, times, subsequently, leiden, university, s, rychard, j, bouwens, and, garth, d, illingworth, from, uc, observatories, lick, observatory, found, the, galaxy, udfj, 39546284, to, be, even, older, at, a, time, some, 480, million, years, after, the, big, bang, or, about, halfway, through, the, dark, ages, 13, 2, billion, years, ago, in, december, 2012, the, first, candidate, galaxies, dating, to, before, reionization, were, discovered, when, udfy, 38135539, egsy8p7, and, gn, z11, galaxies, were, found, to, be, around, 380, 550, million, years, after, the, big, bang, 13, 4, billion, years, ago, and, at, a, distance, of, around, 32, billion, light, years, 9, 8, billion, parsecs, quasars, provide, some, additional, evidence, of, early, structure, formation, their, light, shows, evidence, of, elements, such, as, carbon, magnesium, iron, and, oxygen, this, is, evidence, that, by, the, time, quasars, formed, a, massive, phase, of, star, formation, had, already, taken, place, including, sufficient, generations, of, population, iii, stars, to, give, rise, to, these, elements, as, the, first, stars, dwarf, galaxies, and, quasars, gradually, form, the, intense, radiation, they, emit, reionizes, much, of, the, surrounding, universe, splitting, the, neutral, hydrogen, atoms, back, into, a, plasma, of, free, electrons, and, protons, for, the, first, time, since, recombination, and, decoupling, reionization, is, evidenced, from, observations, of, quasars, quasars, are, a, form, of, active, galaxy, and, the, most, luminous, objects, observed, in, the, universe, electrons, in, neutral, hydrogen, have, specific, patterns, of, absorbing, ultraviolet, photons, related, to, electron, energy, levels, and, called, the, lyman, series, ionized, hydrogen, does, not, have, electron, energy, levels, of, this, kind, therefore, light, travelling, through, ionized, hydrogen, and, neutral, hydrogen, shows, different, absorption, lines, ionized, hydrogen, in, the, intergalactic, medium, particularly, electrons, can, scatter, light, through, thomson, scattering, as, it, did, before, recombination, but, the, expansion, of, the, universe, and, clumping, of, gas, into, galaxies, resulted, in, a, concentration, too, low, to, make, the, universe, fully, opaque, by, the, time, of, reionization, because, of, the, immense, distance, travelled, by, light, billions, of, light, years, to, reach, earth, from, structures, existing, during, reionization, any, absorption, by, neutral, hydrogen, is, redshifted, by, various, amounts, rather, than, by, one, specific, amount, indicating, when, the, absorption, of, then, ultraviolet, light, happened, these, features, make, it, possible, to, study, the, state, of, ionization, at, many, different, times, in, the, past, reionization, began, as, bubbles, of, ionized, hydrogen, which, became, larger, over, time, until, the, entire, intergalactic, medium, was, ionized, when, the, absorption, lines, by, neutral, hydrogen, become, rare, the, absorption, was, due, to, the, general, state, of, the, universe, the, intergalactic, medium, and, not, due, to, passing, through, galaxies, or, other, dense, areas, reionization, might, have, started, to, happen, as, early, as, z, 16, 250, million, years, of, cosmic, time, and, was, mostly, complete, by, around, z, 9, or, 10, 500, million, years, with, the, remaining, neutral, hydrogen, becoming, fully, ionized, z, 5, or, 6, 1, billion, years, when, gunn, peterson, troughs, that, show, the, presence, of, large, amounts, of, neutral, hydrogen, disappear, the, intergalactic, medium, remains, predominantly, ionized, to, the, present, day, the, exception, being, some, remaining, neutral, hydrogen, clouds, which, cause, lyman, alpha, forests, to, appear, in, spectra, these, observations, have, narrowed, down, the, period, of, time, during, which, reionization, took, place, but, the, source, of, the, photons, that, caused, reionization, is, still, not, completely, certain, to, ionize, neutral, hydrogen, an, energy, larger, than, 13, 6, ev, is, required, which, corresponds, to, ultraviolet, photons, with, a, wavelength, of, 91, 2, nm, or, shorter, implying, that, the, sources, must, have, produced, significant, amount, of, ultraviolet, and, higher, energy, protons, and, electrons, will, recombine, if, energy, is, not, continuously, provided, to, keep, them, apart, which, also, sets, limits, on, how, numerous, the, sources, were, and, their, longevity, with, these, constraints, it, is, expected, that, quasars, and, first, generation, stars, and, galaxies, were, the, main, sources, of, energy, the, current, leading, candidates, from, most, to, least, significant, are, currently, believed, to, be, population, iii, stars, the, earliest, stars, possibly, 70, dwarf, galaxies, very, early, small, high, energy, galaxies, possibly, 30, and, a, contribution, from, quasars, a, class, of, active, galactic, nuclei, however, by, this, time, matter, had, become, far, more, spread, out, due, to, the, ongoing, expansion, of, the, universe, although, the, neutral, hydrogen, atoms, were, again, ionized, the, plasma, was, much, more, thin, and, diffuse, and, photons, were, much, less, likely, to, be, scattered, despite, being, reionized, the, universe, remained, largely, transparent, during, reionization, due, how, sparse, the, intergalactic, medium, was, reionization, gradually, ended, as, the, intergalactic, medium, became, virtually, completely, ionized, although, some, regions, of, neutral, hydrogen, do, exist, creating, lyman, alpha, forests, in, august, 2023, images, of, black, holes, and, related, matter, in, the, very, early, universe, by, the, james, webb, space, telescope, were, reported, and, discussed, matter, continues, to, draw, together, under, the, influence, of, gravity, to, form, galaxies, the, stars, from, this, time, period, known, as, population, ii, stars, are, formed, early, on, in, this, process, with, more, recent, population, i, stars, formed, later, gravitational, attraction, also, gradually, pulls, galaxies, towards, each, other, to, form, groups, clusters, and, superclusters, hubble, ultra, deep, field, observations, has, identified, a, number, of, small, galaxies, merging, to, form, larger, ones, at, 800, million, years, of, cosmic, time, 13, billion, years, ago, this, age, estimate, is, now, believed, to, be, slightly, overstated, using, the, 10, metre, keck, ii, telescope, on, mauna, kea, richard, ellis, of, the, california, institute, of, technology, at, pasadena, and, his, team, found, six, star, forming, galaxies, about, 13, 2, billion, light, years, away, and, therefore, created, when, the, universe, was, only, 500, million, years, old, only, about, 10, of, these, extremely, early, objects, are, currently, known, more, recent, observations, have, shown, these, ages, to, be, shorter, than, previously, indicated, the, most, distant, galaxy, observed, as, of, october, 2016, gn, z11, has, been, reported, to, be, 32, billion, light, years, away, a, vast, distance, made, possible, through, spacetime, expansion, z, 11, 1, comoving, distance, of, 32, billion, light, years, lookback, time, of, 13, 4, billion, years, the, universe, has, appeared, much, the, same, as, it, does, now, for, many, billions, of, years, it, will, continue, to, look, similar, for, many, more, billions, of, years, into, the, future, the, galactic, disk, of, the, milky, way, is, estimated, to, have, been, formed, 8, 8, 1, 7, billion, years, ago, but, only, the, age, of, the, sun, 4, 567, billion, years, is, known, precisely, from, about, 9, 8, billion, years, of, cosmic, time, the, universe, s, large, scale, behavior, is, believed, to, have, gradually, changed, for, the, third, time, in, its, history, its, behavior, had, originally, been, dominated, by, radiation, relativistic, constituents, such, as, photons, and, neutrinos, for, the, first, 47, 000, years, and, since, about, 370, 000, years, of, cosmic, time, its, behavior, had, been, dominated, by, matter, during, its, matter, dominated, era, the, expansion, of, the, universe, had, begun, to, slow, down, as, gravity, reined, in, the, initial, outward, expansion, but, from, about, 9, 8, billion, years, of, cosmic, time, observations, show, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, slowly, stops, decelerating, and, gradually, begins, to, accelerate, again, instead, while, the, precise, cause, is, not, known, the, observation, is, accepted, as, correct, by, the, cosmologist, community, by, far, the, most, accepted, understanding, is, that, this, is, due, to, an, unknown, form, of, energy, which, has, been, given, the, name, dark, energy, dark, in, this, context, means, that, it, is, not, directly, observed, but, its, existence, can, be, deduced, by, examining, the, gravitational, effect, it, has, on, the, universe, research, is, ongoing, to, understand, this, dark, energy, dark, energy, is, now, believed, to, be, the, single, largest, component, of, the, universe, as, it, constitutes, about, 68, 3, of, the, entire, mass, energy, of, the, physical, universe, dark, energy, is, believed, to, act, like, a, cosmological, constant, a, scalar, field, that, exists, throughout, space, unlike, gravity, the, effects, of, such, a, field, do, not, diminish, or, only, diminish, slowly, as, the, universe, grows, while, matter, and, gravity, have, a, greater, effect, initially, their, effect, quickly, diminishes, as, the, universe, continues, to, expand, objects, in, the, universe, which, are, initially, seen, to, be, moving, apart, as, the, universe, expands, continue, to, move, apart, but, their, outward, motion, gradually, slows, down, this, slowing, effect, becomes, smaller, as, the, universe, becomes, more, spread, out, eventually, the, outward, and, repulsive, effect, of, dark, energy, begins, to, dominate, over, the, inward, pull, of, gravity, instead, of, slowing, down, and, perhaps, beginning, to, move, inward, under, the, influence, of, gravity, from, about, 9, 8, billion, years, of, cosmic, time, the, expansion, of, space, starts, to, slowly, accelerate, outward, at, a, gradually, increasing, rate, there, are, several, competing, scenarios, for, the, long, term, evolution, of, the, universe, which, of, them, will, happen, if, any, depends, on, the, precise, values, of, physical, constants, such, as, the, cosmological, constant, the, possibility, of, proton, decay, the, energy, of, the, vacuum, meaning, the, energy, of, empty, space, itself, and, the, natural, laws, beyond, the, standard, model, if, the, expansion, of, the, universe, continues, and, it, stays, in, its, present, form, eventually, all, but, the, nearest, galaxies, will, be, carried, away, from, us, by, the, expansion, of, space, at, such, a, velocity, that, the, observable, universe, will, be, limited, to, our, own, gravitationally, bound, local, galaxy, cluster, in, the, very, long, term, after, many, trillions, thousands, of, billions, of, years, cosmic, time, the, stelliferous, era, will, end, as, stars, cease, to, be, born, and, even, the, longest, lived, stars, gradually, die, beyond, this, all, objects, in, the, universe, will, cool, and, with, the, possible, exception, of, protons, gradually, decompose, back, to, their, constituent, particles, and, then, into, subatomic, particles, and, very, low, level, photons, and, other, fundamental, particles, by, a, variety, of, possible, processes, ultimately, in, the, extreme, future, the, following, scenarios, have, been, proposed, for, the, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, the, effect, would, be, that, the, quantum, fields, that, underpin, all, forces, particles, and, structures, would, undergo, a, transition, to, a, more, stable, form, new, forces, and, particles, would, replace, the, present, ones, we, know, of, with, the, side, effect, that, all, current, particles, forces, and, structures, would, be, destroyed, and, subsequently, if, able, reform, into, different, particles, forces, and, structures, in, this, kind, of, extreme, timescale, extremely, rare, quantum, phenomena, may, also, occur, that, are, extremely, unlikely, to, be, seen, on, a, timescale, smaller, than, trillions, of, years, these, may, also, lead, to, unpredictable, changes, to, the, state, of, the, universe, which, would, not, be, likely, to, be, significant, on, any, smaller, timescale, for, example, on, a, timescale, of, millions, of, trillions, of, years, black, holes, might, appear, to, evaporate, almost, instantly, uncommon, quantum, tunnelling, phenomena, would, appear, to, be, common, and, quantum, or, other, phenomena, so, unlikely, that, they, might, occur, just, once, in, a, trillion, years, may, occur, many, times
