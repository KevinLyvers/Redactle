in, particle, physics, a, meson, m, i, z, n, m, z, n, is, a, type, of, hadronic, subatomic, particle, composed, of, an, equal, number, of, quarks, and, antiquarks, usually, one, of, each, bound, together, by, the, strong, interaction, because, mesons, are, composed, of, quark, subparticles, they, have, a, meaningful, physical, size, a, diameter, of, roughly, one, femtometre, 10, 15, m, which, is, about, 0, 6, times, the, size, of, a, proton, or, neutron, all, mesons, are, unstable, with, the, longest, lived, lasting, for, only, a, few, tenths, of, a, nanosecond, heavier, mesons, decay, to, lighter, mesons, and, ultimately, to, stable, electrons, neutrinos, and, photons, outside, the, nucleus, mesons, appear, in, nature, only, as, short, lived, products, of, very, high, energy, collisions, between, particles, made, of, quarks, such, as, cosmic, rays, high, energy, protons, and, neutrons, and, baryonic, matter, mesons, are, routinely, produced, artificially, in, cyclotrons, or, other, particle, accelerators, in, the, collisions, of, protons, antiprotons, or, other, particles, higher, energy, more, massive, mesons, were, created, momentarily, in, the, big, bang, but, are, not, thought, to, play, a, role, in, nature, today, however, such, heavy, mesons, are, regularly, created, in, particle, accelerator, experiments, that, explore, the, nature, of, the, heavier, quarks, that, compose, the, heavier, mesons, mesons, are, part, of, the, hadron, particle, family, which, are, defined, simply, as, particles, composed, of, two, or, more, quarks, the, other, members, of, the, hadron, family, are, the, baryons, subatomic, particles, composed, of, odd, numbers, of, valence, quarks, at, least, three, and, some, experiments, show, evidence, of, exotic, mesons, which, do, not, have, the, conventional, valence, quark, content, of, two, quarks, one, quark, and, one, antiquark, but, four, or, more, because, quarks, have, a, spin, 1, 2, the, difference, in, quark, number, between, mesons, and, baryons, results, in, conventional, two, quark, mesons, being, bosons, whereas, baryons, are, fermions, each, type, of, meson, has, a, corresponding, antiparticle, antimeson, in, which, quarks, are, replaced, by, their, corresponding, antiquarks, and, vice, versa, for, example, a, positive, pion, is, made, of, one, up, quark, and, one, down, antiquark, and, its, corresponding, antiparticle, the, negative, pion, is, made, of, one, up, antiquark, and, one, down, quark, because, mesons, are, composed, of, quarks, they, participate, in, both, the, weak, interaction, and, strong, interaction, mesons, with, net, electric, charge, also, participate, in, the, electromagnetic, interaction, mesons, are, classified, according, to, their, quark, content, total, angular, momentum, parity, and, various, other, properties, such, as, c, parity, and, g, parity, although, no, meson, is, stable, those, of, lower, mass, are, nonetheless, more, stable, than, the, more, massive, and, hence, are, easier, to, observe, and, study, in, particle, accelerators, or, in, cosmic, ray, experiments, the, lightest, group, of, mesons, is, less, massive, than, the, lightest, group, of, baryons, meaning, that, they, are, more, easily, produced, in, experiments, and, thus, exhibit, certain, higher, energy, phenomena, more, readily, than, do, baryons, but, mesons, can, be, quite, massive, for, example, the, j, psi, meson, j, containing, the, charm, quark, first, seen, 1974, is, about, three, times, as, massive, as, a, proton, and, the, upsilon, meson, containing, the, bottom, quark, first, seen, in, 1977, is, about, ten, times, as, massive, as, a, proton, from, theoretical, considerations, in, 1934, hideki, yukawa, predicted, the, existence, and, the, approximate, mass, of, the, meson, as, the, carrier, of, the, nuclear, force, that, holds, atomic, nuclei, together, if, there, were, no, nuclear, force, all, nuclei, with, two, or, more, protons, would, fly, apart, due, to, electromagnetic, repulsion, yukawa, called, his, carrier, particle, the, meson, from, mesos, the, greek, word, for, intermediate, because, its, predicted, mass, was, between, that, of, the, electron, and, that, of, the, proton, which, has, about, 1, 836, times, the, mass, of, the, electron, yukawa, or, carl, david, anderson, who, discovered, the, muon, had, originally, named, the, particle, the, mesotron, but, he, was, corrected, by, the, physicist, werner, heisenberg, whose, father, was, a, professor, of, greek, at, the, university, of, munich, heisenberg, pointed, out, that, there, is, no, tr, in, the, greek, word, mesos, the, first, candidate, for, yukawa, s, meson, in, modern, terminology, known, as, the, muon, was, discovered, in, 1936, by, carl, david, anderson, and, others, in, the, decay, products, of, cosmic, ray, interactions, the, mu, meson, had, about, the, right, mass, to, be, yukawa, s, carrier, of, the, strong, nuclear, force, but, over, the, course, of, the, next, decade, it, became, evident, that, it, was, not, the, right, particle, it, was, eventually, found, that, the, mu, meson, did, not, participate, in, the, strong, nuclear, interaction, at, all, but, rather, behaved, like, a, heavy, version, of, the, electron, and, was, eventually, classed, as, a, lepton, like, the, electron, rather, than, a, meson, physicists, in, making, this, choice, decided, that, properties, other, than, particle, mass, should, control, their, classification, there, were, years, of, delays, in, the, subatomic, particle, research, during, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, with, most, physicists, working, in, applied, projects, for, wartime, necessities, when, the, war, ended, in, august, 1945, many, physicists, gradually, returned, to, peacetime, research, the, first, true, meson, to, be, discovered, was, what, would, later, be, called, the, pi, meson, or, pion, during, 1939, 1942, debendra, mohan, bose, and, bibha, chowdhuri, exposed, ilford, half, tone, photographic, plates, in, the, high, altitude, mountainous, regions, of, darjeeling, and, observed, long, curved, ionizing, tracks, that, appeared, to, be, different, from, the, tracks, of, alpha, particles, or, protons, in, a, series, of, articles, published, in, nature, they, identified, a, cosmic, particle, having, an, average, mass, close, to, 200, times, the, mass, of, electron, this, discovery, was, made, in, 1947, with, improved, full, tone, photographic, emulsion, plates, by, cecil, powell, hugh, muirhead, c, sar, lattes, and, giuseppe, occhialini, who, were, investigating, cosmic, ray, products, at, the, university, of, bristol, in, england, based, on, photographic, films, placed, in, the, andes, mountains, some, of, those, mesons, had, about, the, same, mass, as, the, already, known, mu, meson, yet, seemed, to, decay, into, it, leading, physicist, robert, marshak, to, hypothesize, in, 1947, that, it, was, actually, a, new, and, different, meson, over, the, next, few, years, more, experiments, showed, that, the, pion, was, indeed, involved, in, strong, interactions, the, pion, as, a, virtual, particle, is, also, used, as, force, carrier, to, model, the, nuclear, force, in, atomic, nuclei, between, protons, and, neutrons, this, is, an, approximation, as, the, actual, carrier, of, the, strong, force, is, believed, to, be, the, gluon, which, is, explicitly, used, to, model, strong, interaction, between, quarks, other, mesons, such, as, the, virtual, rho, mesons, are, used, to, model, this, force, as, well, but, to, a, lesser, extent, following, the, discovery, of, the, pion, yukawa, was, awarded, the, 1949, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, predictions, for, a, while, in, the, past, the, word, meson, was, sometimes, used, to, mean, any, force, carrier, such, as, the, z, 0, meson, which, is, involved, in, mediating, the, weak, interaction, however, this, use, has, fallen, out, of, favor, and, mesons, are, now, defined, as, particles, composed, of, pairs, of, quarks, and, antiquarks, spin, quantum, number, s, is, a, vector, quantity, that, represents, the, intrinsic, angular, momentum, of, a, particle, it, comes, in, increments, of, 1, 2, quarks, are, fermions, specifically, in, this, case, particles, having, spin, 1, 2, s, 1, 2, because, spin, projections, vary, in, increments, of, 1, that, is, 1, a, single, quark, has, a, spin, vector, of, length, 1, 2, and, has, two, spin, projections, either, s, z, 1, 2, or, s, z, 1, 2, two, quarks, can, have, their, spins, aligned, in, which, case, the, two, spin, vectors, add, to, make, a, vector, of, length, s, 1, with, three, possible, spin, projections, s, z, 1, s, z, 0, and, s, z, 1, and, their, combination, is, called, a, vector, meson, or, spin, 1, triplet, if, two, quarks, have, oppositely, aligned, spins, the, spin, vectors, add, up, to, make, a, vector, of, length, s, 0, and, only, one, spin, projection, s, z, 0, called, a, scalar, meson, or, spin, 0, singlet, because, mesons, are, made, of, one, quark, and, one, antiquark, they, are, found, in, triplet, and, singlet, spin, states, the, latter, are, called, scalar, mesons, or, pseudoscalar, mesons, depending, on, their, parity, see, below, there, is, another, quantity, of, quantized, angular, momentum, called, the, orbital, angular, momentum, quantum, number, l, that, is, the, angular, momentum, due, to, quarks, orbiting, each, other, and, also, comes, in, increments, of, 1, the, total, angular, momentum, quantum, number, j, of, a, particle, is, the, combination, of, the, two, intrinsic, angular, momentums, spin, and, the, orbital, angular, momentum, it, can, take, any, value, from, j, l, s, up, to, j, l, s, in, increments, of, 1, particle, physicists, are, most, interested, in, mesons, with, no, orbital, angular, momentum, l, 0, therefore, the, two, groups, of, mesons, most, studied, are, the, s, 1, l, 0, and, s, 0, l, 0, which, corresponds, to, j, 1, and, j, 0, although, they, are, not, the, only, ones, it, is, also, possible, to, obtain, j, 1, particles, from, s, 0, and, l, 1, how, to, distinguish, between, the, s, 1, l, 0, and, s, 0, l, 1, mesons, is, an, active, area, of, research, in, meson, spectroscopy, p, parity, is, left, right, parity, or, spatial, parity, and, was, the, first, of, several, parities, discovered, and, so, is, often, called, just, parity, if, the, universe, were, reflected, in, a, mirror, most, laws, of, physics, would, be, identical, things, would, behave, the, same, way, regardless, of, what, we, call, left, and, what, we, call, right, this, concept, of, mirror, reflection, is, called, parity, p, gravity, the, electromagnetic, force, and, the, strong, interaction, all, behave, in, the, same, way, regardless, of, whether, or, not, the, universe, is, reflected, in, a, mirror, and, thus, are, said, to, conserve, parity, p, symmetry, however, the, weak, interaction, does, distinguish, left, from, right, a, phenomenon, called, parity, violation, p, violation, based, on, this, one, might, think, that, if, the, wavefunction, for, each, particle, more, precisely, the, quantum, field, for, each, particle, type, were, simultaneously, mirror, reversed, then, the, new, set, of, wavefunctions, would, perfectly, satisfy, the, laws, of, physics, apart, from, the, weak, interaction, it, turns, out, that, this, is, not, quite, true, in, order, for, the, equations, to, be, satisfied, the, wavefunctions, of, certain, types, of, particles, have, to, be, multiplied, by, 1, in, addition, to, being, mirror, reversed, such, particle, types, are, said, to, have, negative, or, odd, parity, p, 1, or, alternatively, p, whereas, the, other, particles, are, said, to, have, positive, or, even, parity, p, 1, or, alternatively, p, for, mesons, parity, is, related, to, the, orbital, angular, momentum, by, the, relation, where, the, l, is, a, result, of, the, parity, of, the, corresponding, spherical, harmonic, of, the, wavefunction, the, 1, comes, from, the, fact, that, according, to, the, dirac, equation, a, quark, and, an, antiquark, have, opposite, intrinsic, parities, therefore, the, intrinsic, parity, of, a, meson, is, the, product, of, the, intrinsic, parities, of, the, quark, 1, and, antiquark, 1, as, these, are, different, their, product, is, 1, and, so, it, contributes, the, 1, that, appears, in, the, exponent, as, a, consequence, all, mesons, with, no, orbital, angular, momentum, l, 0, have, odd, parity, p, 1, c, parity, is, only, defined, for, mesons, that, are, their, own, antiparticle, i, e, neutral, mesons, it, represents, whether, or, not, the, wavefunction, of, the, meson, remains, the, same, under, the, interchange, of, their, quark, with, their, antiquark, if, then, the, meson, is, c, even, c, 1, on, the, other, hand, if, then, the, meson, is, c, odd, c, 1, c, parity, rarely, is, studied, on, its, own, but, more, commonly, in, combination, with, p, parity, into, cp, parity, cp, parity, was, originally, thought, to, be, conserved, but, was, later, found, to, be, violated, on, rare, occasions, in, weak, interactions, g, parity, is, a, generalization, of, the, c, parity, instead, of, simply, comparing, the, wavefunction, after, exchanging, quarks, and, antiquarks, it, compares, the, wavefunction, after, exchanging, the, meson, for, the, corresponding, antimeson, regardless, of, quark, content, if, then, the, meson, is, g, even, g, 1, on, the, other, hand, if, then, the, meson, is, g, odd, g, 1, the, concept, of, isospin, was, first, proposed, by, werner, heisenberg, in, 1932, to, explain, the, similarities, between, protons, and, neutrons, under, the, strong, interaction, although, they, had, different, electric, charges, their, masses, were, so, similar, that, physicists, believed, that, they, were, actually, the, same, particle, the, different, electric, charges, were, explained, as, being, the, result, of, some, unknown, excitation, similar, to, spin, this, unknown, excitation, was, later, dubbed, isospin, by, eugene, wigner, in, 1937, when, the, first, mesons, were, discovered, they, too, were, seen, through, the, eyes, of, isospin, and, so, the, three, pions, were, believed, to, be, the, same, particle, but, in, different, isospin, states, the, mathematics, of, isospin, was, modeled, after, the, mathematics, of, spin, isospin, projections, varied, in, increments, of, 1, just, like, those, of, spin, and, to, each, projection, was, associated, a, charged, state, because, the, pion, particle, had, three, charged, states, it, was, said, to, be, of, isospin, i, 1, its, charged, states, 0, and, corresponded, to, the, isospin, projections, i, 3, 1, i, 3, 0, and, i, 3, 1, respectively, another, example, is, the, rho, particle, also, with, three, charged, states, its, charged, states, 0, and, corresponded, to, the, isospin, projections, i, 3, 1, i, 3, 0, and, i, 3, 1, respectively, this, belief, lasted, until, murray, gell, mann, proposed, the, quark, model, in, 1964, containing, originally, only, the, u, d, and, s, quarks, the, success, of, the, isospin, model, is, now, understood, to, be, an, artifact, of, the, similar, masses, of, the, u, and, d, quarks, because, the, u, and, d, quarks, have, similar, masses, particles, made, of, the, same, number, of, them, also, have, similar, masses, the, exact, u, and, d, quark, composition, determines, the, charge, because, u, quarks, carry, charge, 2, 3, whereas, d, quarks, carry, charge, 1, 3, for, example, the, three, pions, all, have, different, charges, but, they, all, have, similar, masses, c, 140, mev, c, 2, as, they, are, each, composed, of, a, same, total, number, of, up, and, down, quarks, and, antiquarks, under, the, isospin, model, they, were, considered, a, single, particle, in, different, charged, states, after, the, quark, model, was, adopted, physicists, noted, that, the, isospin, projections, were, related, to, the, up, and, down, quark, content, of, particles, by, the, relation, where, the, n, symbols, are, the, count, of, up, and, down, quarks, and, antiquarks, in, the, isospin, picture, the, three, pions, and, three, rhos, were, thought, to, be, the, different, states, of, two, particles, however, in, the, quark, model, the, rhos, are, excited, states, of, pions, isospin, although, conveying, an, inaccurate, picture, of, things, is, still, used, to, classify, hadrons, leading, to, unnatural, and, often, confusing, nomenclature, because, mesons, are, hadrons, the, isospin, classification, is, also, used, for, them, all, with, the, quantum, number, calculated, by, adding, i, 3, 1, 2, for, each, positively, charged, up, or, down, quark, or, antiquark, up, quarks, and, down, antiquarks, and, i, 3, 1, 2, for, each, negatively, charged, up, or, down, quark, or, antiquark, up, antiquarks, and, down, quarks, the, strangeness, quantum, number, s, not, to, be, confused, with, spin, was, noticed, to, go, up, and, down, along, with, particle, mass, the, higher, the, mass, the, lower, more, negative, the, strangeness, the, more, s, quarks, particles, could, be, described, with, isospin, projections, related, to, charge, and, strangeness, mass, see, the, uds, nonet, figures, as, other, quarks, were, discovered, new, quantum, numbers, were, made, to, have, similar, description, of, udc, and, udb, nonets, because, only, the, u, and, d, mass, are, similar, this, description, of, particle, mass, and, charge, in, terms, of, isospin, and, flavour, quantum, numbers, only, works, well, for, the, nonets, made, of, one, u, one, d, and, one, other, quark, and, breaks, down, for, the, other, nonets, for, example, ucb, nonet, if, the, quarks, all, had, the, same, mass, their, behaviour, would, be, called, symmetric, because, they, would, all, behave, in, exactly, the, same, way, with, respect, to, the, strong, interaction, however, as, quarks, do, not, have, the, same, mass, they, do, not, interact, in, the, same, way, exactly, like, an, electron, placed, in, an, electric, field, will, accelerate, more, than, a, proton, placed, in, the, same, field, because, of, its, lighter, mass, and, the, symmetry, is, said, to, be, broken, it, was, noted, that, charge, q, was, related, to, the, isospin, projection, i, 3, the, baryon, number, b, and, flavour, quantum, numbers, s, c, b, t, by, the, gell, mann, nishijima, formula, where, s, c, b, and, t, represent, the, strangeness, charm, bottomness, and, topness, flavour, quantum, numbers, respectively, they, are, related, to, the, number, of, strange, charm, bottom, and, top, quarks, and, antiquark, according, to, the, relations, meaning, that, the, gell, mann, nishijima, formula, is, equivalent, to, the, expression, of, charge, in, terms, of, quark, content, mesons, are, classified, into, groups, according, to, their, isospin, i, total, angular, momentum, j, parity, p, g, parity, g, or, c, parity, c, when, applicable, and, quark, q, content, the, rules, for, classification, are, defined, by, the, particle, data, group, and, are, rather, convoluted, the, rules, are, presented, below, in, table, form, for, simplicity, mesons, are, classified, into, types, according, to, their, spin, configurations, some, specific, configurations, are, given, special, names, based, on, the, mathematical, properties, of, their, spin, configuration, flavourless, mesons, are, mesons, made, of, pair, of, quark, and, antiquarks, of, the, same, flavour, all, their, flavour, quantum, numbers, are, zero, s, 0, c, 0, b, 0, t, 0, the, rules, for, flavourless, mesons, are, flavoured, mesons, are, mesons, made, of, pair, of, quark, and, antiquarks, of, different, flavours, the, rules, are, simpler, in, this, case, the, main, symbol, depends, on, the, heavier, quark, the, superscript, depends, on, the, charge, and, the, subscript, if, any, depends, on, the, lighter, quark, in, table, form, they, are, there, is, experimental, evidence, for, particles, that, are, hadrons, i, e, are, composed, of, quarks, and, are, color, neutral, with, zero, baryon, number, and, thus, by, conventional, definition, are, mesons, yet, these, particles, do, not, consist, of, a, single, quark, antiquark, pair, as, all, the, other, conventional, mesons, discussed, above, do, a, tentative, category, for, these, particles, is, exotic, mesons, there, are, at, least, five, exotic, meson, resonances, that, have, been, experimentally, confirmed, to, exist, by, two, or, more, independent, experiments, the, most, statistically, significant, of, these, is, the, z, 4430, discovered, by, the, belle, experiment, in, 2007, and, confirmed, by, lhcb, in, 2014, it, is, a, candidate, for, being, a, tetraquark, a, particle, composed, of, two, quarks, and, two, antiquarks, see, the, main, article, above, for, other, particle, resonances, that, are, candidates, for, being, exotic, mesons, 0, or, 0, e, e, or, 0, makeup, inexact, due,

k, 0, l, and, k, 0, s, are, given, as, that, of, the, k, 0, however, it, is, known, that, a, difference, between, the, masses, of, the, k, 0, l, and, k, 0, s, on, the, order, of, 2, 2, 10, 11, mev, c, 2, exists, weak, eigenstate, makeup, is, missing, small, cp, violating, term, see, notes, on, neutral, kaons, below, pdg, reports, the, resonance, width, here, the, conversion, is, given, instead, the, exact, value, depends, on, the, method, used, see, the, given, reference, for, detail, there, are, two, complications, with, neutral, kaons, note, that, these, issues, also, exist, in, principle, for, other, neutral, flavored, mesons, however, the, weak, eigenstates, are, considered, separate, particles, only, for, kaons, because, of, their, dramatically, different, lifetimes
