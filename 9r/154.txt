a, lunar, eclipse, is, an, astronomical, event, that, occurs, when, the, moon, moves, into, the, earth, s, shadow, causing, the, moon, to, be, darkened, such, an, alignment, occurs, during, an, eclipse, season, approximately, every, six, months, during, the, full, moon, phase, when, the, moon, s, orbital, plane, is, closest, to, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, orbit, this, can, occur, only, when, the, sun, earth, and, moon, are, exactly, or, very, closely, aligned, in, syzygy, with, earth, between, the, other, two, which, can, happen, only, on, the, night, of, a, full, moon, when, the, moon, is, near, either, lunar, node, the, type, and, length, of, a, lunar, eclipse, depend, on, the, moon, s, proximity, to, the, lunar, node, when, the, moon, is, totally, eclipsed, by, the, earth, a, deep, eclipse, it, takes, on, a, reddish, color, that, is, caused, by, the, planet, when, it, completely, blocks, direct, sunlight, from, reaching, the, moon, s, surface, as, the, only, light, that, is, reflected, from, the, lunar, surface, is, what, has, been, refracted, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, this, light, appears, reddish, due, to, the, rayleigh, scattering, of, blue, light, the, same, reason, sunrises, and, sunsets, are, more, orange, than, during, the, day, unlike, a, solar, eclipse, which, can, only, be, viewed, from, a, relatively, small, area, of, the, world, a, lunar, eclipse, may, be, viewed, from, anywhere, on, the, night, side, of, earth, a, total, lunar, eclipse, can, last, up, to, nearly, two, hours, while, a, total, solar, eclipse, lasts, only, a, few, minutes, at, any, given, place, because, the, moon, s, shadow, is, smaller, also, unlike, solar, eclipses, lunar, eclipses, are, safe, to, view, without, any, eye, protection, or, special, precautions, the, symbol, for, a, lunar, eclipse, or, indeed, any, body, in, the, shadow, of, another, is, u, 1f776, earth, s, shadow, can, be, divided, into, two, distinctive, parts, the, umbra, and, penumbra, earth, totally, occludes, direct, solar, radiation, within, the, umbra, the, central, region, of, the, shadow, however, since, the, sun, s, diameter, appears, to, be, about, one, quarter, of, earth, s, in, the, lunar, sky, the, planet, only, partially, blocks, direct, sunlight, within, the, penumbra, the, outer, portion, of, the, shadow, a, penumbral, lunar, eclipse, occurs, when, part, or, all, of, the, moon, s, near, side, passes, into, the, earth, s, penumbra, no, part, of, the, moon, is, in, the, earth, s, umbra, during, this, event, meaning, that, on, all, or, a, part, of, the, moon, s, surface, facing, earth, the, sun, is, partially, blocked, the, penumbra, causes, a, subtle, dimming, of, the, lunar, surface, which, is, only, visible, to, the, naked, eye, when, the, majority, of, the, moon, s, diameter, has, immersed, into, earth, s, penumbra, a, special, type, of, penumbral, eclipse, is, a, total, penumbral, lunar, eclipse, during, which, the, entire, moon, lies, exclusively, within, earth, s, penumbra, total, penumbral, eclipses, are, rare, and, when, these, occur, the, portion, of, the, moon, closest, to, the, umbra, may, appear, slightly, darker, than, the, rest, of, the, lunar, disk, when, the, moon, s, near, side, penetrates, partially, into, the, earth, s, umbra, it, is, known, as, a, partial, lunar, eclipse, while, a, total, lunar, eclipse, occurs, when, the, entire, moon, enters, the, earth, s, umbra, during, this, event, one, part, of, the, moon, is, in, the, earth, s, umbra, while, the, other, part, is, in, the, earth, s, penumbra, the, moon, s, average, orbital, speed, is, about, 1, 03, km, s, 2, 300, mph, or, a, little, more, than, its, diameter, per, hour, so, totality, may, last, up, to, nearly, 107, minutes, nevertheless, the, total, time, between, the, first, and, last, contacts, of, the, moon, s, limb, with, earth, s, shadow, is, much, longer, and, could, last, up, to, 236, minutes, when, the, moon, s, near, side, entirely, passes, into, the, earth, s, umbral, shadow, a, total, lunar, eclipse, occurs, just, prior, to, complete, entry, the, brightness, of, the, lunar, limb, the, curved, edge, of, the, moon, still, being, hit, by, direct, sunlight, will, cause, the, rest, of, the, moon, to, appear, comparatively, dim, the, moment, the, moon, enters, a, complete, eclipse, the, entire, surface, will, become, more, or, less, uniformly, bright, being, able, to, reveal, stars, surrounding, it, later, as, the, moon, s, opposite, limb, is, struck, by, sunlight, the, overall, disk, will, again, become, obscured, this, is, because, as, viewed, from, the, earth, the, brightness, of, a, lunar, limb, is, generally, greater, than, that, of, the, rest, of, the, surface, due, to, reflections, from, the, many, surface, irregularities, within, the, limb, sunlight, striking, these, irregularities, is, always, reflected, back, in, greater, quantities, than, that, striking, more, central, parts, which, is, why, the, edges, of, full, moons, generally, appear, brighter, than, the, rest, of, the, lunar, surface, this, is, similar, to, the, effect, of, velvet, fabric, over, a, convex, curved, surface, which, to, an, observer, will, appear, darkest, at, the, center, of, the, curve, it, will, be, true, of, any, planetary, body, with, little, or, no, atmosphere, and, an, irregular, cratered, surface, e, g, mercury, when, viewed, opposite, the, sun, central, lunar, eclipse, is, a, total, lunar, eclipse, during, which, the, moon, passes, near, and, through, the, centre, of, earth, s, shadow, contacting, the, antisolar, point, this, type, of, lunar, eclipse, is, relatively, rare, the, relative, distance, of, the, moon, from, earth, at, the, time, of, an, eclipse, can, affect, the, eclipse, s, duration, in, particular, when, the, moon, is, near, apogee, the, farthest, point, from, earth, in, its, orbit, its, orbital, speed, is, the, slowest, the, diameter, of, earth, s, umbra, does, not, decrease, appreciably, within, the, changes, in, the, moon, s, orbital, distance, thus, the, concurrence, of, a, totally, eclipsed, moon, near, apogee, will, lengthen, the, duration, of, totality, a, selenelion, or, selenehelion, also, called, a, horizontal, eclipse, occurs, where, and, when, both, the, sun, and, an, eclipsed, moon, can, be, observed, at, the, same, time, the, event, can, only, be, observed, just, before, sunset, or, just, after, sunrise, when, both, bodies, will, appear, just, above, opposite, horizons, at, nearly, opposite, points, in, the, sky, a, selenelion, occurs, during, every, total, lunar, eclipse, it, is, an, experience, of, the, observer, not, a, planetary, event, separate, from, the, lunar, eclipse, itself, typically, observers, on, earth, located, on, high, mountain, ridges, undergoing, false, sunrise, or, false, sunset, at, the, same, moment, of, a, total, lunar, eclipse, will, be, able, to, experience, it, although, during, selenelion, the, moon, is, completely, within, the, earth, s, umbra, both, it, and, the, sun, can, be, observed, in, the, sky, because, atmospheric, refraction, causes, each, body, to, appear, higher, i, e, more, central, in, the, sky, than, its, true, geometric, planetary, position, the, timing, of, total, lunar, eclipses, is, determined, by, what, are, known, as, its, contacts, moments, of, contact, with, earth, s, shadow, the, following, scale, the, danjon, scale, was, devised, by, andr, danjon, for, rating, the, overall, darkness, of, lunar, eclipses, there, is, often, confusion, between, a, solar, eclipse, and, a, lunar, eclipse, while, both, involve, interactions, between, the, sun, earth, and, the, moon, they, are, very, different, in, their, interactions, the, moon, does, not, completely, darken, as, it, passes, through, the, umbra, because, of, the, refraction, of, sunlight, by, earth, s, atmosphere, into, the, shadow, cone, if, earth, had, no, atmosphere, the, moon, would, be, completely, dark, during, the, eclipse, the, reddish, coloration, arises, because, sunlight, reaching, the, moon, must, pass, through, a, long, and, dense, layer, of, earth, s, atmosphere, where, it, is, scattered, shorter, wavelengths, are, more, likely, to, be, scattered, by, the, air, molecules, and, small, particles, thus, the, longer, wavelengths, predominate, by, the, time, the, light, rays, have, penetrated, the, atmosphere, human, vision, perceives, this, resulting, light, as, red, this, is, the, same, effect, that, causes, sunsets, and, sunrises, to, turn, the, sky, a, reddish, color, an, alternative, way, of, conceiving, this, scenario, is, to, realize, that, as, viewed, from, the, moon, the, sun, would, appear, to, be, setting, or, rising, behind, earth, the, amount, of, refracted, light, depends, on, the, amount, of, dust, or, clouds, in, the, atmosphere, this, also, controls, how, much, light, is, scattered, in, general, the, dustier, the, atmosphere, the, more, that, other, wavelengths, of, light, will, be, removed, compared, to, red, light, leaving, the, resulting, light, a, deeper, red, color, this, causes, the, resulting, coppery, red, hue, of, the, moon, to, vary, from, one, eclipse, to, the, next, volcanoes, are, notable, for, expelling, large, quantities, of, dust, into, the, atmosphere, and, a, large, eruption, shortly, before, an, eclipse, can, have, a, large, effect, on, the, resulting, color, several, cultures, have, myths, related, to, lunar, eclipses, or, allude, to, the, lunar, eclipse, as, being, a, good, or, bad, omen, the, egyptians, saw, the, eclipse, as, a, sow, swallowing, the, moon, for, a, short, time, other, cultures, view, the, eclipse, as, the, moon, being, swallowed, by, other, animals, such, as, a, jaguar, in, mayan, tradition, or, a, mythical, three, legged, toad, known, as, chan, chu, in, china, some, societies, thought, it, was, a, demon, swallowing, the, moon, and, that, they, could, chase, it, away, by, throwing, stones, and, curses, at, it, the, ancient, greeks, correctly, believed, the, earth, was, round, and, used, the, shadow, from, the, lunar, eclipse, as, evidence, some, hindus, believe, in, the, importance, of, bathing, in, the, ganges, river, following, an, eclipse, because, it, will, help, to, achieve, salvation, similarly, to, the, mayans, the, incans, believed, that, lunar, eclipses, occurred, when, a, jaguar, ate, the, moon, which, is, why, a, blood, moon, looks, red, the, incans, also, believed, that, once, the, jaguar, finished, eating, the, moon, it, could, come, down, and, devour, all, the, animals, on, earth, so, they, would, take, spears, and, shout, at, the, moon, to, keep, it, away, the, ancient, mesopotamians, believed, that, a, lunar, eclipse, was, when, the, moon, was, being, attacked, by, seven, demons, this, attack, was, more, than, just, one, on, the, moon, however, for, the, mesopotamians, linked, what, happened, in, the, sky, with, what, happened, on, the, land, and, because, the, king, of, mesopotamia, represented, the, land, the, seven, demons, were, thought, to, be, also, attacking, the, king, in, order, to, prevent, this, attack, on, the, king, the, mesopotamians, made, someone, pretend, to, be, the, king, so, they, would, be, attacked, instead, of, the, true, king, after, the, lunar, eclipse, was, over, the, substitute, king, was, made, to, disappear, possibly, by, poisoning, in, some, chinese, cultures, people, would, ring, bells, to, prevent, a, dragon, or, other, wild, animals, from, biting, the, moon, in, the, 19th, century, during, a, lunar, eclipse, the, chinese, navy, fired, its, artillery, because, of, this, belief, during, the, zhou, dynasty, c, 1046, 256, bc, in, the, book, of, songs, the, sight, of, a, red, moon, engulfed, in, darkness, was, believed, to, foreshadow, famine, or, disease, certain, lunar, eclipses, have, been, referred, to, as, blood, moons, in, popular, articles, but, this, is, not, a, scientifically, recognized, term, this, term, has, been, given, two, separate, but, overlapping, meanings, the, meaning, usually, relates, to, the, reddish, color, a, totally, eclipsed, moon, takes, on, to, observers, on, earth, as, sunlight, penetrates, the, atmosphere, of, earth, the, gaseous, layer, filters, and, refracts, the, rays, in, such, a, way, that, the, green, to, violet, wavelengths, on, the, visible, spectrum, scatter, more, strongly, than, the, red, thus, giving, the, moon, a, reddish, cast, this, is, possible, because, the, rays, from, the, sun, are, able, to, wrap, around, the, earth, and, reflect, off, the, moon, at, least, two, lunar, eclipses, and, as, many, as, five, occur, every, year, although, total, lunar, eclipses, are, significantly, less, common, than, partial, lunar, eclipses, if, the, date, and, time, of, an, eclipse, is, known, the, occurrences, of, upcoming, eclipses, are, predictable, using, an, eclipse, cycle, like, the, saros, eclipses, occur, only, during, an, eclipse, season, when, the, sun, appears, to, pass, near, either, node, of, the, moon, s, orbit, a, lunar, eclipse, is, on, the, moon, a, solar, eclipse, the, occurrence, makes, earth, s, atmosphere, appear, as, a, red, ring, around, the, dark, earth, during, full, moon, the, phase, when, lunar, eclipses, take, place, the, dark, side, of, the, earth, is, illuminated, by, the, moon, and, its, moon, light
