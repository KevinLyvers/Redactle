a, meadow, m, d, o, med, oh, is, an, open, habitat, or, field, vegetated, by, grasses, herbs, and, other, non, woody, plants, trees, or, shrubs, may, sparsely, populate, meadows, as, long, as, these, areas, maintain, an, open, character, meadows, can, occur, naturally, under, favourable, conditions, but, are, often, artificially, created, from, cleared, shrub, or, woodland, for, the, production, of, hay, fodder, or, livestock, meadow, habitats, as, a, group, are, characterized, as, semi, natural, grasslands, meaning, that, they, are, largely, composed, of, species, native, to, the, region, with, only, limited, human, intervention, meadows, attract, a, multitude, of, wildlife, and, support, flora, and, fauna, that, could, not, thrive, in, other, habitats, they, are, ecologically, important, as, they, provide, areas, for, animal, courtship, displays, nesting, food, gathering, pollinating, insects, and, sometimes, sheltering, if, the, vegetation, is, high, enough, intensified, agricultural, practices, too, frequent, mowing, use, of, mineral, fertilizers, manure, and, insecticides, may, lead, to, declines, in, the, abundance, of, organisms, and, species, diversity, there, are, multiple, types, of, meadows, including, agricultural, transitional, and, perpetual, each, playing, a, unique, and, important, part, of, the, ecosystem, like, other, biomes, meadows, will, experience, increased, pressure, including, on, their, biodiversity, due, to, climate, change, especially, as, precipitation, and, weather, conditions, change, however, grasslands, and, meadows, also, have, an, important, climate, change, mitigation, potential, as, carbon, sinks, deep, rooted, grasses, store, a, substantial, amount, of, carbon, in, soil, in, agriculture, a, meadow, is, grassland, which, is, not, regularly, grazed, by, domestic, livestock, but, rather, allowed, to, grow, unchecked, in, order, to, produce, hay, their, roots, extend, back, to, the, iron, age, when, appropriate, tools, for, the, hay, harvest, emerged, the, ability, to, produce, livestock, fodder, on, meadows, had, a, significant, advantage, for, livestock, production, as, animals, could, be, kept, in, enclosures, simplifying, the, control, over, breeding, surpluses, in, biomass, production, during, the, summer, could, be, stored, for, the, winter, preventing, damages, to, forests, and, grasslands, as, there, was, no, longer, the, need, for, livestock, grazing, during, the, winter, especially, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, the, term, meadow, is, commonly, used, in, its, original, sense, to, mean, a, hay, meadow, signifying, grassland, mown, annually, in, the, summer, for, making, hay, agricultural, meadows, are, typically, lowland, or, upland, fields, upon, which, hay, or, pasture, grasses, grow, from, self, sown, or, hand, sown, seed, traditional, hay, meadows, were, once, common, in, rural, britain, but, are, now, in, decline, ecologist, professor, john, rodwell, states, that, over, the, past, century, england, and, wales, have, lost, about, 97, of, their, hay, meadows, fewer, than, 15, 000, hectares, 37, 000, acres, of, lowland, meadows, remain, in, the, uk, and, most, sites, are, relatively, small, and, fragmented, 25, of, the, uk, s, meadows, are, found, in, worcestershire, with, foster, s, green, meadow, managed, by, the, worcestershire, wildlife, trust, being, a, major, site, a, similar, concept, to, the, hay, meadow, is, the, pasture, which, differs, from, the, meadow, in, that, it, is, grazed, through, the, summer, rather, than, being, allowed, to, grow, out, and, periodically, be, cut, for, hay, a, pasture, can, also, refer, to, any, land, used, for, grazing, and, in, this, wider, sense, the, term, refers, not, only, to, grass, pasture, but, also, to, non, grassland, habitats, such, as, heathland, moorland, and, wood, pasture, the, term, grassland, is, used, to, describe, both, hay, meadows, and, grass, pastures, the, specific, agricultural, practices, in, relation, to, the, meadow, can, take, on, various, expressions, as, mentioned, this, could, be, hay, production, or, providing, food, for, grazing, cattle, and, livestock, but, also, to, give, room, for, orchards, or, honey, production, meadows, are, embedded, and, dependent, on, a, complex, web, of, socio, cultural, conditions, for, their, maintenance, historically, they, emerged, to, increase, agricultural, efficiency, when, the, necessary, tools, became, available, today, agricultural, practices, have, shifted, and, meadows, have, largely, lost, their, original, purpose, yet, they, are, appreciated, today, for, their, aesthetics, and, ecological, functions, consequently, the, european, union, s, common, agricultural, policy, subsidizes, their, management, mostly, through, grazing, a, transitional, meadow, occurs, when, a, field, pasture, farmland, or, other, cleared, land, is, no, longer, cut, or, grazed, and, starts, to, display, luxuriant, growth, extending, to, the, flowering, and, self, seeding, of, its, grass, and, wildflower, species, the, condition, is, however, only, temporary, because, the, grasses, eventually, become, shaded, out, when, scrub, and, woody, plants, become, well, established, being, the, forerunners, of, the, return, to, a, fully, wooded, state, a, transitional, state, can, be, artificially, maintained, through, a, double, field, system, in, which, cultivated, soil, and, meadows, are, alternated, for, a, period, of, 10, to, 12, years, each, in, north, america, prior, to, european, colonization, algonquians, iroquois, and, other, native, americans, peoples, regularly, cleared, areas, of, forest, to, create, transitional, meadows, where, deer, and, game, could, find, food, and, be, hunted, for, example, some, of, today, s, meadows, originated, thousands, of, years, ago, due, to, regular, burnings, by, native, americans, a, perpetual, meadow, also, called, a, natural, meadow, is, one, in, which, environmental, factors, such, as, climatic, and, soil, conditions, are, favorable, to, perennial, grasses, and, restrict, the, growth, of, woody, plants, indefinitely, types, of, perpetual, meadows, may, include, recently, urban, areas, have, been, thought, of, as, potential, biodiversity, conservation, sites, the, shift, from, urban, lawns, that, are, widely, spread, habitats, in, cities, to, urban, meadows, is, thought, to, promote, greater, refuges, for, plant, and, animal, communities, urban, lawns, require, intensive, management, that, puts, the, life, there, at, risk, of, losing, their, habitat, especially, due, to, the, mowing, frequency, cutting, that, mowing, frequency, has, demonstrated, to, induce, a, clear, positive, effect, on, the, plant, community, s, diversity, which, allows, the, switch, from, urban, lawns, to, urban, meadows, due, to, increased, urbanization, the, eu, biodiversity, strategy, 2017, decreed, that, there, is, a, need, to, protect, all, ecosystems, due, to, climate, change, the, majority, of, the, people, that, live, in, the, urban, regions, of, any, country, usually, get, their, plant, knowledge, from, visiting, parks, and, or, public, green, infrastructure, local, authorities, have, the, duty, of, providing, the, green, spaces, for, the, public, but, these, departments, are, constantly, suffering, major, budget, cuts, making, it, more, difficult, for, people, to, admire, natural, wildlife, in, the, urban, sectors, and, also, impairing, the, local, ecosystem, in, line, with, the, increasing, acceptance, of, a, messier, urban, aesthetic, the, perennial, meadows, can, be, seen, as, a, more, realistic, alternative, to, the, classic, urban, lawns, as, they, would, also, be, more, cost, efficient, to, maintain, factors, that, managers, of, urban, spaces, list, as, important, to, regard, are, artificially, or, culturally, conceived, meadows, emerge, from, and, continually, require, human, intervention, to, persist, and, flourish, in, many, places, the, natural, pristine, populations, of, free, roaming, large, grazers, are, either, extinct, or, very, limited, due, to, human, activities, this, reduces, or, removes, their, natural, influence, on, the, surrounding, ecology, and, results, in, meadows, only, being, created, or, maintained, by, human, intervention, existing, meadows, could, potentially, and, gradually, decline, if, unmaintained, by, agricultural, practices, humankind, has, influenced, the, ecology, and, the, landscape, for, millennia, in, many, parts, of, the, world, so, it, can, sometimes, be, difficult, to, discern, what, is, natural, and, what, is, cultural, meadows, are, one, example, however, meadows, seem, to, have, been, sustained, historically, by, naturally, occurring, large, grazers, which, kept, plant, growth, in, checked, and, maintained, the, cleared, space, as, extensive, farming, like, grazing, is, diminishing, in, some, parts, of, the, world, the, meadow, is, endangered, as, a, habitat, a, number, of, research, projects, attempt, to, restore, natural, meadow, habitats, by, reintroducing, natural, large, grazers, these, include, deer, elk, goat, wild, horse, etc, depending, on, the, location, a, more, exotic, example, with, a, wider, scope, is, the, european, tauros, programme, some, environmental, organization, recommend, converting, lawns, to, meadows, by, stopping, or, reducing, mowing, they, claim, that, meadows, can, better, preserve, biodiversity, water, reduce, the, use, of, fertilizers, for, example, in, 2018, environmental, organizations, with, the, support, of, the, department, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, of, england, concerned, by, the, decline, in, the, number, of, bees, worldwide, in, the, first, day, of, bees, needs, week, 2018, 9, 15, july, give, some, recommendation, how, to, preserve, bees, the, recommendations, include, 1, growing, flowers, shrubs, and, trees, 2, letting, the, garden, grow, wild, 3, cutting, grass, less, often, 4, leaving, insect, nest, and, hibernation, spots, alone, and, 5, using, careful, consideration, with, pesticides, the, impact, of, human, activity, has, been, noted, to, increase, degradation, of, meadow, soil, this, has, contributed, to, landslides, in, sholas, e, g, due, to, skiing, activities, and, urbanization, the, meadows, of, the, town, of, zakopane, poland, were, noted, to, have, altered, soil, compositions, the, soil, s, organic, material, had, faded, away, and, was, affected, due, to, the, chemicals, from, the, artificial, melting, water, from, the, snow, and, skiing, machinery, climate, changes, impact, temperature, precipitation, patterns, worldwide, the, effects, are, regionally, very, different, but, generally, temperatures, tend, to, increase, snowpacks, tend, to, melt, earlier, and, many, places, tend, to, become, drier, many, species, respond, to, these, changes, by, slowly, moving, their, habitat, upwards, the, increased, elevation, decreases, mean, temperatures, and, thus, allows, for, species, to, largely, maintain, their, original, habitat, another, common, response, to, changed, environmental, conditions, are, phenological, adaptations, these, include, shifts, in, the, timing, of, germination, or, blossoming, other, examples, include, for, example, changing, migration, patterns, of, birds, of, passage, these, adaptations, are, primarily, influenced, by, three, drivers, in, the, meadows, as, water, turned, out, to, be, all, the, more, scant, that, implies, less, dampness, for, the, plants, the, blooming, plants, do, not, develop, too, and, hence, do, not, give, much, food, to, the, creatures, these, kinds, of, changes, in, the, plants, could, influence, population, of, buffalo, just, as, numerous, other, more, creatures, including, bugs, and, insects, in, response, to, temperature, changes, flowering, plants, can, respond, through, either, spatial, or, temporal, shifts, a, spatial, shift, refers, to, the, migration, towards, colder, areas, often, on, higher, altitudes, a, temporal, shift, means, that, a, plant, may, alter, its, phenology, to, blossom, at, a, different, time, of, the, year, by, moving, towards, the, early, spring, or, late, autumn, they, can, restore, their, previous, temperature, conditions, these, adaptations, are, limited, through, spatial, shifts, may, be, difficult, if, the, areas, are, already, inhabited, by, other, species, or, when, the, plant, is, reliant, on, specific, hydrology, or, soil, type, other, authors, have, shown, that, higher, temperatures, can, increase, total, biomass, but, temperature, shocks, and, instability, seem, to, have, negative, impacts, on, biodiversity, this, even, appears, to, be, the, case, for, multiyear, species, which, were, previously, considered, to, have, a, buffering, effect, on, extreme, weather, events, there, is, a, variety, of, hydrological, regimes, for, meadows, ranging, from, dry, to, humid, each, yielding, different, plant, communities, adapted, to, the, respective, provider, of, water, a, shift, in, precipitation, patterns, has, very, different, effects, depending, on, the, type, of, meadow, meadows, that, are, either, dry, or, wet, appear, to, be, rather, resilient, to, change, as, a, moderate, increase, or, decrease, in, precipitation, does, not, radically, alter, their, character, meanwhile, mesic, meadows, with, a, moderate, supply, of, water, do, change, their, character, as, it, is, easier, to, tip, them, into, a, different, regime, dry, meadows, in, particular, are, threatened, by, the, invasion, of, shrubs, and, other, woody, plants, and, a, decreasing, prevalence, of, flowering, forbs, whereas, hydric, sites, tend, to, lose, woody, species, due, to, the, dryer, upper, soil, layers, forbs, with, shallow, roots, have, difficulties, obtaining, enough, water, woody, plants, in, contrast, with, their, lower, reaching, root, systems, can, still, extract, water, stored, in, lower, soil, layers, and, are, able, to, sustain, themselves, through, longer, drought, periods, with, their, stored, water, reserves, in, the, longer, term, changing, hydrologic, regimes, may, also, facilitate, the, establishment, of, invasive, species, that, may, be, better, adapted, to, the, new, conditions, the, effects, are, already, quite, visible, an, example, is, the, substitution, of, alpine, meadows, in, the, southern, himalayas, through, shrubland, climate, change, appears, to, be, an, important, driver, of, this, process, wetter, winters, in, contrast, might, increase, total, biomass, but, favour, already, competitive, species, by, harming, specialised, plants, and, promoting, the, prevalence, of, more, generalist, species, more, unstable, precipitation, patterns, could, also, reduce, ecological, biodiversity, snow, covers, are, directly, related, to, changes, in, temperature, precipitation, and, cloud, cover, still, changes, in, the, timing, of, the, snowmelt, seem, to, be, particularly, in, alpine, regions, an, important, determinant, for, phenological, responses, there, is, even, data, suggesting, that, the, impact, of, snowmelt, is, even, higher, than, the, warming, alone, earlier, are, not, uniformly, positive, for, plants, though, as, moisture, injected, through, snow, melt, might, be, missing, later, in, the, year, additionally, it, might, allow, for, longer, periods, of, seed, predation, problematic, is, also, the, lack, of, the, insulating, snow, cover, springtime, frost, events, might, have, a, larger, negative, impact, all, the, drivers, mentioned, above, give, rise, to, complex, non, linear, community, responses, these, responses, can, be, disentangled, by, looking, at, multiple, climate, drivers, and, species, together, as, different, species, show, varying, degrees, of, phenological, responses, the, consequence, is, a, so, called, phenological, reassembly, where, the, structure, of, the, ecosystem, changes, fundamentally, phenological, responses, in, blossoming, periods, of, certain, plants, may, not, coincide, with, the, phenological, shifts, of, their, pollinators, or, growing, periods, of, plant, communities, relying, on, each, other, may, start, to, diverge, a, study, of, meadows, in, the, rocky, mountains, revealed, the, emergence, of, a, mid, season, period, with, little, floral, activity, specifically, the, study, identified, that, the, typical, mid, summer, floral, peak, was, composed, out, of, several, consecutive, peaks, in, dry, mesic, and, wet, meadow, systems, phenological, responses, to, climate, change, let, these, distinct, peaks, diverge, leading, to, a, gap, during, mid, summer, this, poses, a, threat, to, pollinators, relying, on, a, continuous, supply, of, floral, resources, as, ecological, communities, are, often, highly, adapted, to, local, circumstances, which, can, not, be, reproduced, at, higher, elevations, debinski, et, al, describe, the, short, term, changes, observed, on, meadows, as, a, shift, in, the, mosaic, of, the, landscape, composition, therefore, it, is, important, to, monitor, not, only, how, specific, species, respond, to, climate, change, but, to, also, investigate, them, in, the, context, of, different, habitats, they, occur, in, animals, as, well, as, plants, are, changing, rapidly, to, the, anthropogenic, global, warming, and, the, number, of, individuals, habitat, occupancy, changing, reproductive, cycles, are, the, strategies, to, adapt, to, this, severe, and, unpredictable, environment, alterations, the, different, types, of, meadows, all, around, the, planet, are, different, communities, of, plants, perennial, and, annual, plants, that, constantly, are, interacting, with, each, other, to, stay, alive, and, reproduce, timing, and, duration, of, flowering, is, one, of, the, phenological, reassembly, driven, by, many, different, factors, like, snow, melt, temperature, and, soil, moisture, to, mention, a, few, all, of, the, changes, that, a, plant, or, an, animal, may, go, through, are, depending, in, habitat, s, topography, altitude, and, latitude, of, a, specific, organism, it, is, important, to, monitor, properly, the, plants, because, they, are, one, of, the, best, bioindicators, of, how, climate, change, is, affecting, the, planet, flowering, phenology, is, one, of, the, most, important, features, of, plant, in, order, to, survive, any, type, of, adversity, thanks, to, different, modern, techniques, and, constant, monitoring, we, can, assure, which, ecological, strategy, the, plants, are, using, in, order, to, multiply, their, species, in, alpine, meadow, of, the, eastern, tibet, notorious, variances, and, similarities, were, observed, between, annual, and, perennial, plants, where, perennial, plants, flowering, peak, date, was, directly, proportional, to, the, duration, and, inversely, proportional, in, annuals, plants, this, is, just, a, limited, quantity, of, many, relationships, on, phenology, and, functional, traits, interacting, with, the, environment, to, survive, climate, change, is, increasing, temperatures, all, over, the, world, and, boreal, regions, are, more, susceptible, to, suffer, noticeable, changes, an, experiment, was, conducted, to, monitor, the, reaction, of, alpine, arctic, meadow, plants, to, different, patterns, of, increased, temperatures, this, experiment, was, based, on, vascular, plants, that, live, in, arctic, and, subarctic, environments, within, three, different, levels, of, vegetation, canopy, layer, bottom, layer, and, functional, groups, it, is, crucial, to, keep, in, mind, that, these, plants, are, usually, sharing, the, space, and, constantly, interacting, with, bryophytes, lichens, arthropods, animals, and, many, other, organisms, the, result, was, a, clear, adaptation, of, a, constant, pattern, that, plants, recognized, and, had, time, to, reach, thermal, acclimation, meaning, that, they, got, a, net, carbon, gain, by, intensifying, photosynthesis, and, slightly, increasing, respiration, thanks, to, a, warmer, climate, for, a, reasonable, time, period, however, plants, that, suffer, changes, of, any, kind, not, only, temperature, rising, and, falling, in, a, short, period, of, time, are, more, likely, to, die, because, they, did, not, have, enough, time, to, reach, thermal, acclimation, meadows, can, act, as, substantial, sinks, and, sources, of, organic, carbon, holding, vast, quantities, of, it, in, the, soil, the, fluxes, of, carbon, depend, mainly, on, the, natural, cycle, of, carbon, uptake, and, efflux, which, interplays, with, seasonal, variations, e, g, non, growing, vs, growing, season, the, wide, range, of, meadow, subtypes, have, in, turn, differing, attributes, like, plant, configurations, affecting, the, area, s, ability, to, act, as, sinks, seagrass, meadows, are, for, instant, identified, as, some, of, the, more, important, sinks, in, the, global, carbon, cycle, in, the, instance, of, seagrass, meadows, enhanced, production, of, other, greenhouse, gases, ch, 4, and, n, 2, o, does, occur, but, the, estimated, overall, effect, results, in, an, offset, of, the, total, emission, meanwhile, a, usual, driver, of, meadow, loss, except, for, direct, alterations, due, to, human, development, is, climate, change, consequently, increasing, carbon, emissions, and, bringing, up, the, topic, of, restoration, projects, which, in, some, cases, have, prompted, initiated, meadow, restorations, e, g, zostera, marina, meadow, in, virginia, u, s, a, where, grassland, degradation, has, occurred, significant, alterations, to, the, carbon, dioxide, efflux, during, the, non, growing, season, may, take, place, both, climate, change, and, overgrazing, factor, into, the, degradation, as, exemplified, by, the, alpine, wetland, meadow, on, the, qinghai, tibetan, plateau, there, is, the, potential, of, being, a, moderate, source, of, co, 2, and, a, carbon, sink, due, to, high, soil, organic, content, and, low, decomposition, the, more, the, dynamics, have, been, quantified, however, the, effects, of, degradation, become, more, tangible, a, strong, connection, between, grass, land, degradation, and, soil, carbon, loss, has, been, seen, pinpointing, that, carbon, dioxide, release, is, being, stimulated, by, this, event, this, subsequently, indicates, a, climate, change, mitigation, potential, by, restoring, degraded, grassland, being, a, market, based, regulation, of, emissions, the, cap, and, trade, system, can, in, some, instances, be, found, incorporating, restoration, projects, for, climate, mitigation, for, example, the, cap, and, trade, program, in, california, is, looking, at, how, meadow, restorations, can, be, incorporated, into, their, system, of, reducing, carbon, emissions, the, preliminary, studies, are, as, depicted, by, audubon, pointing, at, the, potential, of, storing, a, substantially, increased, amount, of, soil, carbon, compared, to, degraded, meadows, while, boosting, the, local, biodiversity, most, recently, though, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, difficulties, with, restoration, are, beginning, to, show, during, the, first, years, areas, under, restoration, are, vulnerable, to, outside, disruption, like, meadow, management, put, on, hold, when, the, ecosystem, is, most, sensitive, for, example, to, invasive, species
