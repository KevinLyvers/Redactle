geophysics, d, i, o, f, z, k, s, is, a, subject, of, natural, science, concerned, with, the, physical, processes, and, physical, properties, of, the, earth, and, its, surrounding, space, environment, and, the, use, of, quantitative, methods, for, their, analysis, geophysicists, who, usually, study, geophysics, physics, or, one, of, the, earth, sciences, at, the, graduate, level, complete, investigations, across, a, wide, range, of, scientific, disciplines, the, term, geophysics, classically, refers, to, solid, earth, applications, earth, s, shape, its, gravitational, magnetic, fields, and, electromagnetic, fields, its, internal, structure, and, composition, its, dynamics, and, their, surface, expression, in, plate, tectonics, the, generation, of, magmas, volcanism, and, rock, formation, however, modern, geophysics, organizations, and, pure, scientists, use, a, broader, definition, that, includes, the, water, cycle, including, snow, and, ice, fluid, dynamics, of, the, oceans, and, the, atmosphere, electricity, and, magnetism, in, the, ionosphere, and, magnetosphere, and, solar, terrestrial, physics, and, analogous, problems, associated, with, the, moon, and, other, planets, although, geophysics, was, only, recognized, as, a, separate, discipline, in, the, 19th, century, its, origins, date, back, to, ancient, times, the, first, magnetic, compasses, were, made, from, lodestones, while, more, modern, magnetic, compasses, played, an, important, role, in, the, history, of, navigation, the, first, seismic, instrument, was, built, in, 132, ad, isaac, newton, applied, his, theory, of, mechanics, to, the, tides, and, the, precession, of, the, equinox, and, instruments, were, developed, to, measure, the, earth, s, shape, density, and, gravity, field, as, well, as, the, components, of, the, water, cycle, in, the, 20th, century, geophysical, methods, were, developed, for, remote, exploration, of, the, solid, earth, and, the, ocean, and, geophysics, played, an, essential, role, in, the, development, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, geophysics, is, applied, to, societal, needs, such, as, mineral, resources, mitigation, of, natural, hazards, and, environmental, protection, in, exploration, geophysics, geophysical, survey, data, are, used, to, analyze, potential, petroleum, reservoirs, and, mineral, deposits, locate, groundwater, find, archaeological, relics, determine, the, thickness, of, glaciers, and, soils, and, assess, sites, for, environmental, remediation, geophysics, is, a, highly, interdisciplinary, subject, and, geophysicists, contribute, to, every, area, of, the, earth, sciences, while, some, geophysicists, conduct, research, in, the, planetary, sciences, to, provide, a, more, clear, idea, on, what, constitutes, geophysics, this, section, describes, phenomena, that, are, studied, in, physics, and, how, they, relate, to, the, earth, and, its, surroundings, geophysicists, also, investigate, the, physical, processes, and, properties, of, the, earth, its, fluid, layers, and, magnetic, field, along, with, the, near, earth, environment, in, the, solar, system, which, includes, other, planetary, bodies, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, moon, and, sun, gives, rise, to, two, high, tides, and, two, low, tides, every, lunar, day, or, every, 24, hours, and, 50, minutes, therefore, there, is, a, gap, of, 12, hours, and, 25, minutes, between, every, high, tide, and, between, every, low, tide, gravitational, forces, make, rocks, press, down, on, deeper, rocks, increasing, their, density, as, the, depth, increases, measurements, of, gravitational, acceleration, and, gravitational, potential, at, the, earth, s, surface, and, above, it, can, be, used, to, look, for, mineral, deposits, see, gravity, anomaly, and, gravimetry, the, surface, gravitational, field, provides, information, on, the, dynamics, of, tectonic, plates, the, geopotential, surface, called, the, geoid, is, one, definition, of, the, shape, of, the, earth, the, geoid, would, be, the, global, mean, sea, level, if, the, oceans, were, in, equilibrium, and, could, be, extended, through, the, continents, such, as, with, very, narrow, canals, the, earth, is, cooling, and, the, resulting, heat, flow, generates, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, through, the, geodynamo, and, plate, tectonics, through, mantle, convection, the, main, sources, of, heat, are, primordial, heat, due, to, earth, s, cooling, and, radioactivity, in, the, planets, upper, crust, there, is, also, some, contributions, from, phase, transitions, heat, is, mostly, carried, to, the, surface, by, thermal, convection, although, there, are, two, thermal, boundary, layers, the, core, mantle, boundary, and, the, lithosphere, in, which, heat, is, transported, by, conduction, some, heat, is, carried, up, from, the, bottom, of, the, mantle, by, mantle, plumes, the, heat, flow, at, the, earth, s, surface, is, about, 4, 2, 10, 13, w, and, it, is, a, potential, source, of, geothermal, energy, seismic, waves, are, vibrations, that, travel, through, the, earth, s, interior, or, along, its, surface, the, entire, earth, can, also, oscillate, in, forms, that, are, called, normal, modes, or, free, oscillations, of, the, earth, ground, motions, from, waves, or, normal, modes, are, measured, using, seismographs, if, the, waves, come, from, a, localized, source, such, as, an, earthquake, or, explosion, measurements, at, more, than, one, location, can, be, used, to, locate, the, source, the, locations, of, earthquakes, provide, information, on, plate, tectonics, and, mantle, convection, recording, of, seismic, waves, from, controlled, sources, provides, information, on, the, region, that, the, waves, travel, through, if, the, density, or, composition, of, the, rock, changes, waves, are, reflected, reflections, recorded, using, reflection, seismology, can, provide, a, wealth, of, information, on, the, structure, of, the, earth, up, to, several, kilometers, deep, and, are, used, to, increase, our, understanding, of, the, geology, as, well, as, to, explore, for, oil, and, gas, changes, in, the, travel, direction, called, refraction, can, be, used, to, infer, the, deep, structure, of, the, earth, earthquakes, pose, a, risk, to, humans, understanding, their, mechanisms, which, depend, on, the, type, of, earthquake, e, g, intraplate, or, deep, focus, can, lead, to, better, estimates, of, earthquake, risk, and, improvements, in, earthquake, engineering, although, we, mainly, notice, electricity, during, thunderstorms, there, is, always, a, downward, electric, field, near, the, surface, that, averages, 120, volts, per, meter, relative, to, the, solid, earth, the, ionization, of, the, planet, s, atmosphere, is, a, result, of, the, galactic, cosmic, rays, penetrating, it, which, leaves, it, with, a, net, positive, charge, a, current, of, about, 1800, amperes, flows, in, the, global, circuit, it, flows, downward, from, the, ionosphere, over, most, of, the, earth, and, back, upwards, through, thunderstorms, the, flow, is, manifested, by, lightning, below, the, clouds, and, sprites, above, a, variety, of, electric, methods, are, used, in, geophysical, survey, some, measure, spontaneous, potential, a, potential, that, arises, in, the, ground, because, of, human, made, or, natural, disturbances, telluric, currents, flow, in, earth, and, the, oceans, they, have, two, causes, electromagnetic, induction, by, the, time, varying, external, origin, geomagnetic, field, and, motion, of, conducting, bodies, such, as, seawater, across, the, earth, s, permanent, magnetic, field, the, distribution, of, telluric, current, density, can, be, used, to, detect, variations, in, electrical, resistivity, of, underground, structures, geophysicists, can, also, provide, the, electric, current, themselves, see, induced, polarization, and, electrical, resistivity, tomography,

caught, in, the, van, allen, radiation, belt, whistlers, are, produced, by, lightning, strikes, hiss, may, be, generated, by, both, electromagnetic, waves, may, also, be, generated, by, earthquakes, see, seismo, electromagnetics, in, the, highly, conductive, liquid, iron, of, the, outer, core, magnetic, fields, are, generated, by, electric, currents, through, electromagnetic, induction, alfv, n, waves, are, magnetohydrodynamic, waves, in, the, magnetosphere, or, the, earth, s, core, in, the, core, they, probably, have, little, observable, effect, on, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, but, slower, waves, such, as, magnetic, rossby, waves, may, be, one, source, of, geomagnetic, secular, variation, electromagnetic, methods, that, are, used, for, geophysical, survey, include, transient, electromagnetics, magnetotellurics, surface, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, and, electromagnetic, seabed, logging, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, protects, the, earth, from, the, deadly, solar, wind, and, has, long, been, used, for, navigation, it, originates, in, the, fluid, motions, of, the, outer, core, the, magnetic, field, in, the, upper, atmosphere, gives, rise, to, the, auroras, the, earth, s, field, is, roughly, like, a, tilted, dipole, but, it, changes, over, time, a, phenomenon, called, geomagnetic, secular, variation, mostly, the, geomagnetic, pole, stays, near, the, geographic, pole, but, at, random, intervals, averaging, 440, 000, to, a, million, years, or, so, the, polarity, of, the, earth, s, field, reverses, these, geomagnetic, reversals, analyzed, within, a, geomagnetic, polarity, time, scale, contain, 184, polarity, intervals, in, the, last, 83, million, years, with, change, in, frequency, over, time, with, the, most, recent, brief, complete, reversal,

information, on, seafloor, spreading, a, part, of, plate, tectonics, they, are, the, basis, of, magnetostratigraphy, which, correlates, magnetic, reversals, with, other, stratigraphies, to, construct, geologic, time, scales, in, addition, the, magnetization, in, rocks, can, be, used, to, measure, the, motion, of, continents, radioactive, decay, accounts, for, about, 80, of, the, earth, s, internal, heat, powering, the, geodynamo, and, plate, tectonics, the, main, heat, producing, isotopes, are, potassium, 40, uranium, 238, uranium, 235, and, thorium, 232, radioactive, elements, are, used, for, radiometric, dating, the, primary, method, for, establishing, an, absolute, time, scale, in, geochronology, unstable, isotopes, decay, at, predictable, rates, and, the, decay, rates, of, different, isotopes, cover, several, orders, of, magnitude, so, radioactive, decay, can, be, used, to, accurately, date, both, recent, events, and, events, in, past, geologic, eras, radiometric, mapping, using, ground, and, airborne, gamma, spectrometry, can, be, used, to, map, the, concentration, and, distribution, of, radioisotopes, near, the, earth, s, surface, which, is, useful, for, mapping, lithology, and, alteration, fluid, motions, occur, in, the, magnetosphere, atmosphere, ocean, mantle, and, core, even, the, mantle, though, it, has, an, enormous, viscosity, flows, like, a, fluid, over, long, time, intervals, this, flow, is, reflected, in, phenomena, such, as, isostasy, post, glacial, rebound, and, mantle, plumes, the, mantle, flow, drives, plate, tectonics, and, the, flow, in, the, earth, s, core, drives, the, geodynamo, geophysical, fluid, dynamics, is, a, primary, tool, in, physical, oceanography, and, meteorology, the, rotation, of, the, earth, has, profound, effects, on, the, earth, s, fluid, dynamics, often, due, to, the, coriolis, effect, in, the, atmosphere, it, gives, rise, to, large, scale, patterns, like, rossby, waves, and, determines, the, basic, circulation, patterns, of, storms, in, the, ocean, they, drive, large, scale, circulation, patterns, as, well, as, kelvin, waves, and, ekman, spirals, at, the, ocean, surface, in, the, earth, s, core, the, circulation, of, the, molten, iron, is, structured, by, taylor, columns, waves, and, other, phenomena, in, the, magnetosphere, can, be, modeled, using, magnetohydrodynamics, the, physical, properties, of, minerals, must, be, understood, to, infer, the, composition, of, the, earth, s, interior, from, seismology, the, geothermal, gradient, and, other, sources, of, information, mineral, physicists, study, the, elastic, properties, of, minerals, their, high, pressure, phase, diagrams, melting, points, and, equations, of, state, at, high, pressure, and, the, rheological, properties, of, rocks, or, their, ability, to, flow, deformation, of, rocks, by, creep, make, flow, possible, although, over, short, times, the, rocks, are, brittle, the, viscosity, of, rocks, is, affected, by, temperature, and, pressure, and, in, turn, determines, the, rates, at, which, tectonic, plates, move, water, is, a, very, complex, substance, and, its, unique, properties, are, essential, for, life, its, physical, properties, shape, the, hydrosphere, and, are, an, essential, part, of, the, water, cycle, and, climate, its, thermodynamic, properties, determine, evaporation, and, the, thermal, gradient, in, the, atmosphere, the, many, types, of, precipitation, involve, a, complex, mixture, of, processes, such, as, coalescence, supercooling, and, supersaturation, some, precipitated, water, becomes, groundwater, and, groundwater, flow, includes, phenomena, such, as, percolation, while, the, conductivity, of, water, makes, electrical, and, electromagnetic, methods, useful, for, tracking, groundwater, flow, physical, properties, of, water, such, as, salinity, have, a, large, effect, on, its, motion, in, the, oceans, the, many, phases, of, ice, form, the, cryosphere, and, come, in, forms, like, ice, sheets, glaciers, sea, ice, freshwater, ice, snow, and, frozen, ground, or, permafrost, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, earth, is, not, entirely, spherical, but, instead, generally, exhibits, an, ellipsoid, shape, which, is, a, result, of, the, centrifugal, forces, the, planet, generates, due, to, its, constant, motion, these, forces, cause, the, planets, diameter, to, bulge, towards, the, equator, and, results, in, the, ellipsoid, shape, earth, s, shape, is, constantly, changing, and, different, factors, including, glacial, isostatic, rebound, large, ice, sheets, melting, causing, the, earth, s, crust, to, the, rebound, due, to, the, release, of, the, pressure, geological, features, such, as, mountains, or, ocean, trenches, tectonic, plate, dynamics, and, natural, disasters, can, further, distort, the, planet, s, shape, evidence, from, seismology, heat, flow, at, the, surface, and, mineral, physics, is, combined, with, the, earth, s, mass, and, moment, of, inertia, to, infer, models, of, the, earth, s, interior, its, composition, density, temperature, pressure, for, example, the, earth, s, mean, specific, gravity, 5, 515, is, far, higher, than, the, typical, specific, gravity, of, rocks, at, the, surface, 2, 7, 3, 3, implying, that, the, deeper, material, is, denser, this, is, also, implied, by, its, low, moment, of, inertia, 0, 33, m, r, 2, compared, to, 0, 4, m, r, 2, for, a, sphere, of, constant, density, however, some, of, the, density, increase, is, compression, under, the, enormous, pressures, inside, the, earth, the, effect, of, pressure, can, be, calculated, using, the, adams, williamson, equation, the, conclusion, is, that, pressure, alone, cannot, account, for, the, increase, in, density, instead, we, know, that, the, earth, s, core, is, composed, of, an, alloy, of, iron, and, other, minerals, reconstructions, of, seismic, waves, in, the, deep, interior, of, the, earth, show, that, there, are, no, s, waves, in, the, outer, core, this, indicates, that, the, outer, core, is, liquid, because, liquids, cannot, support, shear, the, outer, core, is, liquid, and, the, motion, of, this, highly, conductive, fluid, generates, the, earth, s, field, earth, s, inner, core, however, is, solid, because, of, the, enormous, pressure, reconstruction, of, seismic, reflections, in, the, deep, interior, indicates, some, major, discontinuities, in, seismic, velocities, that, demarcate, the, major, zones, of, the, earth, inner, core, outer, core, mantle, lithosphere, and, crust, the, mantle, itself, is, divided, into, the, upper, mantle, transition, zone, lower, mantle, and, d, layer, between, the, crust, and, the, mantle, is, the, mohorovi, i, discontinuity, the, seismic, model, of, the, earth, does, not, by, itself, determine, the, composition, of, the, layers, for, a, complete, model, of, the, earth, mineral, physics, is, needed, to, interpret, seismic, velocities, in, terms, of, composition, the, mineral, properties, are, temperature, dependent, so, the, geotherm, must, also, be, determined, this, requires, physical, theory, for, thermal, conduction, and, convection, and, the, heat, contribution, of, radioactive, elements, the, main, model, for, the, radial, structure, of, the, interior, of, the, earth, is, the, preliminary, reference, earth, model, prem, some, parts, of, this, model, have, been, updated, by, recent, findings, in, mineral, physics, see, post, perovskite, and, supplemented, by, seismic, tomography, the, mantle, is, mainly, composed, of, silicates, and, the, boundaries, between, layers, of, the, mantle, are, consistent, with, phase, transitions, the, mantle, acts, as, a, solid, for, seismic, waves, but, under, high, pressures, and, temperatures, it, deforms, so, that, over, millions, of, years, it, acts, like, a, liquid, this, makes, plate, tectonics, possible, if, a, planet, s, magnetic, field, is, strong, enough, its, interaction, with, the, solar, wind, forms, a, magnetosphere, early, space, probes, mapped, out, the, gross, dimensions, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, which, extends, about, 10, earth, radii, towards, the, sun, the, solar, wind, a, stream, of, charged, particles, streams, out, and, around, the, terrestrial, magnetic, field, and, continues, behind, the, magnetic, tail, hundreds, of, earth, radii, downstream, inside, the, magnetosphere, there, are, relatively, dense, regions, of, solar, wind, particles, called, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, geophysical, measurements, are, generally, at, a, particular, time, and, place, accurate, measurements, of, position, along, with, earth, deformation, and, gravity, are, the, province, of, geodesy, while, geodesy, and, geophysics, are, separate, fields, the, two, are, so, closely, connected, that, many, scientific, organizations, such, as, the, american, geophysical, union, the, canadian, geophysical, union, and, the, international, union, of, geodesy, and, geophysics, encompass, both, absolute, positions, are, most, frequently, determined, using, the, global, positioning, system, gps, a, three, dimensional, position, is, calculated, using, messages, from, four, or, more, visible, satellites, and, referred, to, the, 1980, geodetic, reference, system, an, alternative, optical, astronomy, combines, astronomical, coordinates, and, the, local, gravity, vector, to, get, geodetic, coordinates, this, method, only, provides, the, position, in, two, coordinates, and, is, more, difficult, to, use, than, gps, however, it, is, useful, for, measuring, motions, of, the, earth, such, as, nutation, and, chandler, wobble, relative, positions, of, two, or, more, points, can, be, determined, using, very, long, baseline, interferometry, gravity, measurements, became, part, of, geodesy, because, they, were, needed, to, related, measurements, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, to, the, reference, coordinate, system, gravity, measurements, on, land, can, be, made, using, gravimeters, deployed, either, on, the, surface, or, in, helicopter, flyovers, since, the, 1960s, the, earth, s, gravity, field, has, been, measured, by, analyzing, the, motion, of, satellites, sea, level, can, also, be, measured, by, satellites, using, radar, altimetry, contributing, to, a, more, accurate, geoid, in, 2002, nasa, launched, the, gravity, recovery, and, climate, experiment, grace, wherein, two, twin, satellites, map, variations, in, earth, s, gravity, field, by, making, measurements, of, the, distance, between, the, two, satellites, using, gps, and, a, microwave, ranging, system, gravity, variations, detected, by, grace, include, those, caused, by, changes, in, ocean, currents, runoff, and, ground, water, depletion, melting, ice, sheets, and, glaciers, satellites, in, space, have, made, it, possible, to, collect, data, from, not, only, the, visible, light, region, but, in, other, areas, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, the, planets, can, be, characterized, by, their, force, fields, gravity, and, their, magnetic, fields, which, are, studied, through, geophysics, and, space, physics, measuring, the, changes, in, acceleration, experienced, by, spacecraft, as, they, orbit, has, allowed, fine, details, of, the, gravity, fields, of, the, planets, to, be, mapped, for, example, in, the, 1970s, the, gravity, field, disturbances, above, lunar, maria, were, measured, through, lunar, orbiters, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, concentrations, of, mass, mascons, beneath, the, imbrium, serenitatis, crisium, nectaris, and, humorum, basins, since, geophysics, is, concerned, with, the, shape, of, the, earth, and, by, extension, the, mapping, of, features, around, and, in, the, planet, geophysical, measurements, include, high, accuracy, gps, measurements, these, measurements, are, processed, to, increase, their, accuracy, through, differential, gps, processing, once, the, geophysical, measurements, have, been, processed, and, inverted, the, interpreted, results, are, plotted, using, gis, programs, such, as, arcgis, and, geosoft, were, built, to, meet, these, needs, and, include, many, geophysical, functions, that, are, built, in, such, as, upward, continuation, and, the, calculation, of, the, measurement, derivative, such, as, the, first, vertical, derivative, many, geophysics, companies, have, designed, in, house, geophysics, programs, that, pre, date, arcgis, and, geosoft, in, order, to, meet, the, visualization, requirements, of, a, geophysical, dataset, exploration, geophysics, is, a, branch, of, applied, geophysics, that, involves, the, development, and, utilization, of, different, seismic, or, electromagnetic, methods, which, the, aim, of, investigating, different, energy, mineral, and, water, resources, this, is, done, through, the, uses, of, various, remote, sensing, platforms, such, as, satellites, aircraft, boats, drones, borehole, sensing, equipment, and, seismic, receivers, these, equipment, are, often, used, in, conjunction, with, different, geophysical, methods, such, as, magnetic, gravimetry, electromagnetic, radiometric, barometry, methods, in, order, to, gather, the, data, the, remote, sensing, platforms, used, in, exploration, geophysics, are, not, perfect, and, need, adjustments, done, on, them, in, order, to, accurately, account, for, the, effects, that, the, platform, itself, may, have, on, the, collected, data, for, example, when, gathering, aeromagnetic, data, aircraft, gathered, magnetic, data, using, a, conventional, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, platform, has, to, be, adjusted, to, account, for, the, electromagnetic, currents, that, it, may, generate, as, it, passes, through, earth, s, magnetic, field, there, are, also, corrections, related, to, changes, in, measured, potential, field, intensity, as, the, earth, rotates, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, and, as, the, moon, orbits, the, earth, geophysical, measurements, are, often, recorded, as, time, series, with, gps, location, signal, processing, involves, the, correction, of, time, series, data, for, unwanted, noise, or, errors, introduced, by, the, measurement, platform, such, as, aircraft, vibrations, in, gravity, data, it, also, involves, the, reduction, of, sources, of, noise, such, as, diurnal, corrections, in, magnetic, data, in, seismic, data, electromagnetic, data, and, gravity, data, processing, continues, after, error, corrections, to, include, computational, geophysics, which, result, in, the, final, interpretation, of, the, geophysical, data, into, a, geological, interpretation, of, the, geophysical, measurements, geophysics, emerged, as, a, separate, discipline, only, in, the, 19th, century, from, the, intersection, of, physical, geography, geology, astronomy, meteorology, and, physics, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, geophysics, was, in, german, geophysik, by, julius, fr, bel, in, 1834, however, many, geophysical, phenomena, such, as, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, earthquakes, have, been, investigated, since, the, ancient, era, the, magnetic, compass, existed, in, china, back, as, far, as, the, fourth, century, bc, it, was, used, as, much, for, feng, shui, as, for, navigation, on, land, it, was, not, until, good, steel, needles, could, be, forged, that, compasses, were, used, for, navigation, at, sea, before, that, they, could, not, retain, their, magnetism, long, enough, to, be, useful, the, first, mention, of, a, compass, in, europe, was, in, 1190, ad, in, circa, 240, bc, eratosthenes, of, cyrene, deduced, that, the, earth, was, round, and, measured, the, circumference, of, earth, with, great, precision, he, developed, a, system, of, latitude, and, longitude, perhaps, the, earliest, contribution, to, seismology, was, the, invention, of, a, seismoscope, by, the, prolific, inventor, zhang, heng, in, 132, ad, this, instrument, was, designed, to, drop, a, bronze, ball, from, the, mouth, of, a, dragon, into, the, mouth, of, a, toad, by, looking, at, which, of, eight, toads, had, the, ball, one, could, determine, the, direction, of, the, earthquake, it, was, 1571, years, before, the, first, design, for, a, seismoscope, was, published, in, europe, by, jean, de, la, hautefeuille, it, was, never, built, the, 17th, century, had, major, milestones, that, marked, the, beginning, of, modern, science, in, 1600, william, gilbert, release, a, publication, titled, de, magnete, 1600, where, he, conducted, series, of, experiments, on, both, natural, magnets, called, loadstones, and, artificially, magnetized, iron, his, experiments, lead, to, observations, involving, a, small, compass, needle, versorium, which, replicated, magnetic, behaviours, when, subjected, to, a, spherical, magnet, along, with, it, experiencing, magnetic, dips, when, it, was, pivoted, on, a, horizontal, axis, his, findings, led, to, the, deduction, that,
