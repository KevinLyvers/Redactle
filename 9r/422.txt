iridium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ir, and, atomic, number, 77, a, very, hard, brittle, silvery, white, transition, metal, of, the, platinum, group, it, is, considered, the, second, densest, naturally, occurring, metal, after, osmium, with, a, density, of, 22, 56, g, cm, 3, 0, 815, lb, cu, in, as, defined, by, experimental, x, ray, crystallography, 191, ir, and, 193, ir, are, the, only, two, naturally, occurring, isotopes, of, iridium, as, well, as, the, only, stable, isotopes, the, latter, is, the, more, abundant, it, is, one, of, the, most, corrosion, resistant, metals, even, at, temperatures, as, high, as, 2, 000, c, 3, 630, f, iridium, was, discovered, in, 1803, in, the, acid, insoluble, residues, of, platinum, ores, by, the, english, chemist, smithson, tennant, the, name, iridium, derived, from, the, greek, word, iris, rainbow, refers, to, the, various, colors, of, its, compounds, iridium, is, one, of, the, rarest, elements, in, earth, s, crust, with, an, estimated, annual, production, of, only, 6, 800, kilograms, 15, 000, lb, in, 2023, the, dominant, uses, of, iridium, are, the, metal, itself, and, its, alloys, as, in, high, performance, spark, plugs, crucibles, for, recrystallization, of, semiconductors, at, high, temperatures, and, electrodes, for, the, production, of, chlorine, in, the, chloralkali, process, important, compounds, of, iridium, are, chlorides, and, iodides, in, industrial, catalysis, iridium, is, a, component, of, some, oleds, iridium, is, found, in, meteorites, in, much, higher, abundance, than, in, the, earth, s, crust, for, this, reason, the, unusually, high, abundance, of, iridium, in, the, clay, layer, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, gave, rise, to, the, alvarez, hypothesis, that, the, impact, of, a, massive, extraterrestrial, object, caused, the, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, many, other, species, 66, million, years, ago, now, known, to, be, produced, by, the, impact, that, formed, the, chicxulub, crater, similarly, an, iridium, anomaly, in, core, samples, from, the, pacific, ocean, suggested, the, eltanin, impact, of, about, 2, 5, million, years, ago, a, member, of, the, platinum, group, metals, iridium, is, white, resembling, platinum, but, with, a, slight, yellowish, cast, because, of, its, hardness, brittleness, and, very, high, melting, point, solid, iridium, is, difficult, to, machine, form, or, work, thus, powder, metallurgy, is, commonly, employed, instead, it, is, the, only, metal, to, maintain, good, mechanical, properties, in, air, at, temperatures, above, 1, 600, c, 2, 910, f, it, has, the, 10th, highest, boiling, point, among, all, elements, and, becomes, a, superconductor, at, temperatures, below, 0, 14, k, 273, 010, c, 459, 418, f, iridium, s, modulus, of, elasticity, is, the, second, highest, among, the, metals, being, surpassed, only, by, osmium, this, together, with, a, high, shear, modulus, and, a, very, low, figure, for, poisson, s, ratio, the, relationship, of, longitudinal, to, lateral, strain, indicate, the, high, degree, of, stiffness, and, resistance, to, deformation, that, have, rendered, its, fabrication, into, useful, components, a, matter, of, great, difficulty, despite, these, limitations, and, iridium, s, high, cost, a, number, of, applications, have, developed, where, mechanical, strength, is, an, essential, factor, in, some, of, the, extremely, severe, conditions, encountered, in, modern, technology, the, measured, density, of, iridium, is, only, slightly, lower, by, about, 0, 12, than, that, of, osmium, the, densest, metal, known, some, ambiguity, occurred, regarding, which, of, the, two, elements, was, denser, due, to, the, small, size, of, the, difference, in, density, and, difficulties, in, measuring, it, accurately, but, with, increased, accuracy, in, factors, used, for, calculating, density, x, ray, crystallographic, data, yielded, densities, of, 22, 56, g, cm, 3, 0, 815, lb, cu, in, for, iridium, and, 22, 59, g, cm, 3, 0, 816, lb, cu, in, for, osmium, iridium, is, extremely, brittle, to, the, point, of, being, hard, to, weld, because, the, heat, affected, zone, cracks, but, it, can, be, made, more, ductile, by, addition, of, small, quantities, of, titanium, and, zirconium, 0, 2, of, each, apparently, works, well, the, vickers, hardness, of, pure, platinum, is, 56, hv, whereas, platinum, with, 50, of, iridium, can, reach, over, 500, hv, iridium, is, the, most, corrosion, resistant, metal, known, it, is, not, attacked, by, acids, including, aqua, regia, but, it, can, be, dissolved, in, concentrated, hydrochloric, acid, in, the, presence, of, sodium, perchlorate, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, it, reacts, with, cyanide, salts, traditional, oxidants, also, react, including, the, halogens, and, oxygen, at, higher, temperatures, iridium, also, reacts, directly, with, sulfur, at, atmospheric, pressure, to, yield, iridium, disulfide, iridium, has, two, naturally, occurring, stable, isotopes, 191, ir, and, 193, ir, with, natural, abundances, of, 37, 3, and, 62, 7, respectively, at, least, 37, radioisotopes, have, also, been, synthesized, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 164, to, 202, 192, ir, which, falls, between, the, two, stable, isotopes, is, the, most, stable, radioisotope, with, a, half, life, of, 73, 827, days, and, finds, application, in, brachytherapy, and, in, industrial, radiography, particularly, for, nondestructive, testing, of, welds, in, steel, in, the, oil, and, gas, industries, iridium, 192, sources, have, been, involved, in, a, number, of, radiological, accidents, three, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, at, least, a, day, 188, ir, 189, ir, and, 190, ir, isotopes, with, masses, below, 191, decay, by, some, combination, of, decay, decay, and, rare, proton, emission, with, the, exception, of, 189, ir, which, decays, by, electron, capture, synthetic, isotopes, heavier, than, 191, decay, by, decay, although, 192, ir, also, has, a, minor, electron, capture, decay, path, all, known, isotopes, of, iridium, were, discovered, between, 1934, and, 2008, with, the, most, recent, discoveries, being, 200, 202, ir, at, least, 32, metastable, isomers, have, been, characterized, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 164, to, 197, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 192m2, ir, which, decays, by, isomeric, transition, with, a, half, life, of, 241, years, making, it, more, stable, than, any, of, iridium, s, synthetic, isotopes, in, their, ground, states, the, least, stable, isomer, is, 190m3, ir, with, a, half, life, of, only, 2, s, the, isotope, 191, ir, was, the, first, one, of, any, element, to, be, shown, to, present, a, m, ssbauer, effect, this, renders, it, useful, for, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, for, research, in, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and, mineralogy, iridium, forms, compounds, in, oxidation, states, between, 3, and, 9, but, the, most, common, oxidation, states, are, 1, 2, 3, and, 4, well, characterized, compounds, containing, iridium, in, the, 6, oxidation, state, include, irf, 6, and, the, oxides, sr, 2, mgiro, 6, and, sr, 2, cairo, 6, iridium, viii, oxide, iro, 4, was, generated, under, matrix, isolation, conditions, at, 6, k, in, argon, the, highest, oxidation, state, 9, which, is, also, the, highest, recorded, for, any, element, is, found, in, gaseous, iridium, does, not, form, binary, hydrides, only, one, binary, oxide, is, well, characterized, iridium, dioxide, iro, 2, it, is, a, blue, black, solid, that, adopts, the, fluorite, structure, a, sesquioxide, ir, 2, o, 3, has, been, described, as, a, blue, black, powder, which, is, oxidized, to, iro, 2, by, hno, 3, the, corresponding, disulfides, diselenides, sesquisulfides, and, sesquiselenides, are, known, as, well, as, irs, 3, binary, trihalides, irx, 3, are, known, for, all, of, the, halogens, for, oxidation, states, 4, and, above, only, the, tetrafluoride, pentafluoride, and, hexafluoride, are, known, iridium, hexafluoride, irf, 6, is, a, volatile, yellow, solid, composed, of, octahedral, molecules, it, decomposes, in, water, and, is, reduced, to, irf, 4, iridium, pentafluoride, is, also, a, strong, oxidant, but, it, is, a, tetramer, ir, 4, f, 20, formed, by, four, corner, sharing, octahedra, iridium, has, extensive, coordination, chemistry, iridium, in, its, complexes, is, always, low, spin, ir, iii, and, ir, iv, generally, form, octahedral, complexes, polyhydride, complexes, are, known, for, the, 5, and, 3, oxidation, states, one, example, is, irh, 5, p, i, pr, 3, 2, i, pr, isopropyl, the, ternary, hydride, mg, 6, ir, 2, h, 11, is, believed, to, contain, both, the, irh, 4, 5, and, the, 18, electron, irh, 5, 4, anion, iridium, also, forms, oxyanions, with, oxidation, states, 4, and, 5, k, 2, iro, 3, and, kiro, 3, can, be, prepared, from, the, reaction, of, potassium, oxide, or, potassium, superoxide, with, iridium, at, high, temperatures, such, solids, are, not, soluble, in, conventional, solvents, just, like, many, elements, iridium, forms, important, chloride, complexes, hexachloroiridic, iv, acid, h, 2, ircl, 6, and, its, ammonium, salt, are, common, iridium, compounds, from, both, industrial, and, preparative, perspectives, they, are, intermediates, in, the, purification, of, iridium, and, used, as, precursors, for, most, other, iridium, compounds, as, well, as, in, the, preparation, of, anode, coatings, the, ircl, 2, 6, ion, has, an, intense, dark, brown, color, and, can, be, readily, reduced, to, the, lighter, colored, ircl, 3, 6, and, vice, versa, iridium, trichloride, ircl, 3, which, can, be, obtained, in, anhydrous, form, from, direct, oxidation, of, iridium, powder, by, chlorine, at, 650, c, or, in, hydrated, form, by, dissolving, ir, 2, o, 3, in, hydrochloric, acid, is, often, used, as, a, starting, material, for, the, synthesis, of, other, ir, iii, compounds, another, compound, used, as, a, starting, material, is, potassium, hexachloroiridate, iii, k, 3, ircl, 6, organoiridium, compounds, contain, iridium, carbon, bonds, early, studies, identified, the, very, stable, tetrairidium, dodecacarbonyl, ir, 4, co, 12, in, this, compound, each, of, the, iridium, atoms, is, bonded, to, the, other, three, forming, a, tetrahedral, cluster, the, discovery, of, vaska, s, complex, ircl, co, 2, opened, the, door, for, oxidative, addition, reactions, a, process, fundamental, to, useful, reactions, for, example, crabtree, s, catalyst, a, homogeneous, catalyst, for, hydrogenation, reactions, iridium, complexes, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, development, of, carbon, hydrogen, bond, activation, c, h, activation, which, promises, to, allow, functionalization, of, hydrocarbons, which, are, traditionally, regarded, as, unreactive, the, discovery, of, iridium, is, intertwined, with, that, of, platinum, and, the, other, metals, of, the, platinum, group, the, first, european, reference, to, platinum, appears, in, 1557, in, the, writings, of, the, italian, humanist, julius, caesar, scaliger, as, a, description, of, an, unknown, noble, metal, found, between, dari, n, and, mexico, which, no, fire, nor, any, spanish, artifice, has, yet, been, able, to, liquefy, from, their, first, encounters, with, platinum, the, spanish, generally, saw, the, metal, as, a, kind, of, impurity, in, gold, and, it, was, treated, as, such, it, was, often, simply, thrown, away, and, there, was, an, official, decree, forbidding, the, adulteration, of, gold, with, platinum, impurities, in, 1735, antonio, de, ulloa, and, jorge, juan, y, santacilia, saw, native, americans, mining, platinum, while, the, spaniards, were, travelling, through, colombia, and, peru, for, eight, years, ulloa, and, juan, found, mines, with, the, whitish, metal, nuggets, and, took, them, home, to, spain, ulloa, returned, to, spain, and, established, the, first, mineralogy, lab, in, spain, and, was, the, first, to, systematically, study, platinum, which, was, in, 1748, his, historical, account, of, the, expedition, included, a, description, of, platinum, as, being, neither, separable, nor, calcinable, ulloa, also, anticipated, the, discovery, of, platinum, mines, after, publishing, the, report, in, 1748, ulloa, did, not, continue, to, investigate, the, new, metal, in, 1758, he, was, sent, to, superintend, mercury, mining, operations, in, huancavelica, in, 1741, charles, wood, a, british, metallurgist, found, various, samples, of, colombian, platinum, in, jamaica, which, he, sent, to, william, brownrigg, for, further, investigation, in, 1750, after, studying, the, platinum, sent, to, him, by, wood, brownrigg, presented, a, detailed, account, of, the, metal, to, the, royal, society, stating, that, he, had, seen, no, mention, of, it, in, any, previous, accounts, of, known, minerals, brownrigg, also, made, note, of, platinum, s, extremely, high, melting, point, and, refractory, metal, like, behaviour, toward, borax, other, chemists, across, europe, soon, began, studying, platinum, including, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, torbern, bergman, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, william, lewis, and, pierre, macquer, in, 1752, henrik, scheffer, published, a, detailed, scientific, description, of, the, metal, which, he, referred, to, as, white, gold, including, an, account, of, how, he, succeeded, in, fusing, platinum, ore, with, the, aid, of, arsenic, scheffer, described, platinum, as, being, less, pliable, than, gold, but, with, similar, resistance, to, corrosion, chemists, who, studied, platinum, dissolved, it, in, aqua, regia, a, mixture, of, hydrochloric, and, nitric, acids, to, create, soluble, salts, they, always, observed, a, small, amount, of, a, dark, insoluble, residue, joseph, louis, proust, thought, that, the, residue, was, graphite, the, french, chemists, victor, collet, descotils, antoine, fran, ois, comte, de, fourcroy, and, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, also, observed, the, black, residue, in, 1803, but, did, not, obtain, enough, for, further, experiments, in, 1803, british, scientist, smithson, tennant, 1761, 1815, analyzed, the, insoluble, residue, and, concluded, that, it, must, contain, a, new, metal, vauquelin, treated, the, powder, alternately, with, alkali, and, acids, and, obtained, a, volatile, new, oxide, which, he, believed, to, be, of, this, new, metal, which, he, named, ptene, from, the, greek, word, pt, n, s, winged, tennant, who, had, the, advantage, of, a, much, greater, amount, of, residue, continued, his, research, and, identified, the, two, previously, undiscovered, elements, in, the, black, residue, iridium, and, osmium, he, obtained, dark, red, crystals, probably, of, na, 2, n, h, 2, o, by, a, sequence, of, reactions, with, sodium, hydroxide, and, hydrochloric, acid, he, named, iridium, after, iris, the, greek, winged, goddess, of, the, rainbow, and, the, messenger, of, the, olympian, gods, because, many, of, the, salts, he, obtained, were, strongly, colored, discovery, of, the, new, elements, was, documented, in, a, letter, to, the, royal, society, on, june, 21, 1804, british, scientist, john, george, children, was, the, first, to, melt, a, sample, of, iridium, in, 1813, with, the, aid, of, the, greatest, galvanic, battery, that, has, ever, been, constructed, at, that, time, the, first, to, obtain, high, purity, iridium, was, robert, hare, in, 1842, he, found, it, had, a, density, of, around, 21, 8, g, cm, 3, 0, 79, lb, cu, in, and, noted, the, metal, is, nearly, immalleable, and, very, hard, the, first, melting, in, appreciable, quantity, was, done, by, henri, sainte, claire, deville, and, jules, henri, debray, in, 1860, they, required, burning, more, than, 300, litres, 79, us, gal, of, pure, o, 2, and, h, 2, gas, for, each, 1, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, of, iridium, these, extreme, difficulties, in, melting, the, metal, limited, the, possibilities, for, handling, iridium, john, isaac, hawkins, was, looking, to, obtain, a, fine, and, hard, point, for, fountain, pen, nibs, and, in, 1834, managed, to, create, an, iridium, pointed, gold, pen, in, 1880, john, holland, and, william, lofland, dudley, were, able, to, melt, iridium, by, adding, phosphorus, and, patented, the, process, in, the, united, states, british, company, johnson, matthey, later, stated, they, had, been, using, a, similar, process, since, 1837, and, had, already, presented, fused, iridium, at, a, number, of, world, fairs, the, first, use, of, an, alloy, of, iridium, with, ruthenium, in, thermocouples, was, made, by, otto, feussner, in, 1933, these, allowed, for, the, measurement, of, high, temperatures, in, air, up, to, 2, 000, c, 3, 630, f, in, munich, germany, in, 1957, rudolf, m, ssbauer, in, what, has, been, called, one, of, the, landmark, experiments, in, twentieth, century, physics, discovered, the, resonant, and, recoil, free, emission, and, absorption, of, gamma, rays, by, atoms, in, a, solid, metal, sample, containing, only, 191, ir, this, phenomenon, known, as, the, m, ssbauer, effect, resulted, in, the, awarding, of, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1961, at, the, age, 32, just, three, years, after, he, published, his, discovery, along, with, many, elements, having, atomic, weights, higher, than, that, of, iron, iridium, is, only, naturally, formed, by, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, in, neutron, star, mergers, and, possibly, rare, types, of, supernovae, iridium, is, one, of, the, nine, least, abundant, stable, elements, in, earth, s, crust, having, an, average, mass, fraction, of, 0, 001, ppm, in, crustal, rock, gold, is, 4, times, more, abundant, platinum, is, 10, times, more, abundant, silver, and, mercury, are, 80, times, more, abundant, osmium, tellurium, ruthenium, rhodium, and, rhenium, are, about, as, abundant, as, iridium, in, contrast, to, its, low, abundance, in, crustal, rock, iridium, is, relatively, common, in, meteorites, with, concentrations, of, 0, 5, ppm, or, more, the, overall, concentration, of, iridium, on, earth, is, thought, to, be, much, higher, than, what, is, observed, in, crustal, rocks, but, because, of, the, density, and, siderophilic, iron, loving, character, of, iridium, it, descended, below, the, crust, and, into, earth, s, core, when, the, planet, was, still, molten, iridium, is, found, in, nature, as, an, uncombined, element, or, in, natural, alloys, especially, the, iridium, osmium, alloys, osmiridium, osmium, rich, and, iridosmium, iridium, rich, in, nickel, and, copper, deposits, the, platinum, group, metals, occur, as, sulfides, tellurides, antimonides, and, arsenides, in, all, of, these, compounds, platinum, can, be, exchanged, with, a, small, amount, of, iridium, or, osmium, as, with, all, of, the, platinum, group, metals, iridium, can, be, found, naturally, in, alloys, with, raw, nickel, or, raw, copper, a, number, of, iridium, dominant, minerals, with, iridium, as, the, species, forming, element, are, known, they, are, exceedingly, rare, and, often, represent, the, iridium, analogues, of, the, above, given, ones, the, examples, are, irarsite, and, cuproiridsite, to, mention, some, within, earth, s, crust, iridium, is, found, at, highest, concentrations, in, three, types, of, geologic, structure, igneous, deposits, crustal, intrusions, from, below, impact, craters, and, deposits, reworked, from, one, of, the, former, structures, the, largest, known, primary, reserves, are, in, the, bushveld, igneous, complex, in, south, africa, near, the, largest, known, impact, structure, the, vredefort, impact, structure, though, the, large, copper, nickel, deposits, near, norilsk, in, russia, and, the, sudbury, basin, also, an, impact, crater, in, canada, are, also, significant, sources, of, iridium, smaller, reserves, are, found, in, the, united, states, iridium, is, also, found, in, secondary, deposits, combined, with, platinum, and, other, platinum, group, metals, in, alluvial, deposits, the, alluvial, deposits, used, by, pre, columbian, people, in, the, choc, department, of, colombia, are, still, a, source, for, platinum, group, metals, as, of, 2003, world, reserves, have, not, been, estimated, iridium, is, found, within, marine, organisms, sediments, and, the, water, column, the, abundance, of, iridium, in, seawater, and, organisms, is, relatively, low, as, it, does, not, readily, form, chloride, complexes, the, abundance, in, organisms, is, about, 20, parts, per, trillion, or, about, five, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, in, sedimentary, rocks, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, k, t, boundary, the, concentration, of, iridium, in, seawater, and, marine, sediment, is, sensitive, to, marine, oxygenation, seawater, temperature, and, various, geological, and, biological, processes, iridium, in, sediments, can, come, from, cosmic, dust, volcanoes, precipitation, from, seawater, microbial, processes, or, hydrothermal, vents, and, its, abundance, can, be, strongly, indicative, of, the, source, it, tends, to, associate, with, other, ferrous, metals, in, manganese, nodules, iridium, is, one, of, the, characteristic, elements, of, extraterrestrial, rocks, and, along, with, osmium, can, be, used, as, a, tracer, element, for, meteoritic, material, in, sediment, for, example, core, samples, from, the, pacific, ocean, with, elevated, iridium, levels, suggested, the, eltanin, impact, of, about, 2, 5, million, years, ago, some, of, the, mass, extinctions, such, as, the, cretaceous, extinction, can, be, identified, by, anomalously, high, concentrations, of, iridium, in, sediment, and, these, can, be, linked, to, major, asteroid, impacts, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, of, 66, million, years, ago, marking, the, temporal, border, between, the, cretaceous, and, paleogene, periods, of, geological, time, was, identified, by, a, thin, stratum, of, iridium, rich, clay, a, team, led, by, luis, alvarez, proposed, in, 1980, an, extraterrestrial, origin, for, this, iridium, attributing, it, to, an, asteroid, or, comet, impact, their, theory, known, as, the, alvarez, hypothesis, is, now, widely, accepted, to, explain, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, a, large, buried, impact, crater, structure, with, an, estimated, age, of, about, 66, million, years, was, later, identified, under, what, is, now, the, yucat, n, peninsula, the, chicxulub, crater, dewey, m, mclean, and, others, argue, that, the, iridium, may, have, been, of, volcanic, origin, instead, because, earth, s, core, is, rich, in, iridium, and, active, volcanoes, such, as, piton, de, la, fournaise, in, the, island, of, r, union, are, still, releasing, iridium, worldwide, production, of, iridium, was, about, 7, 300, kilograms, 16, 100, lb, in, 2018, the, price, is, high, and, varying, see, table, illustrative, factors, that, affect, the, price, include, oversupply, of, ir, crucibles, and, changes, in, led, technology, platinum, metals, occur, together, as, dilute, ores, iridium, is, one, of, the, rarer, platinum, metals, for, every, 190, tonnes, of, platinum, obtained, from, ores, only, 7, 5, tonnes, of, iridium, is, isolated, to, separate, the, metals, they, must, first, be, brought, into, solution, two, methods, for, rendering, ir, containing, ores, soluble, are, i, fusion, of, the, solid, with, sodium, peroxide, followed, by, extraction, of, the, resulting, glass, in, aqua, regia, and, ii, extraction, of, the, solid, with, a, mixture, of, chlorine, with, hydrochloric, acid, from, soluble, extracts, iridium, is, separated, by, precipitating, solid, ammonium, hexachloroiridate, nh, 4, 2, ircl, 6, or, by, extracting, ircl, 2, 6, with, organic, amines, the, first, method, is, similar, to, the, procedure, tennant, and, wollaston, used, for, their, original, separation, the, second, method, can, be, planned, as, continuous, liquid, liquid, extraction, and, is, therefore, more, suitable, for, industrial, scale, production, in, either, case, the, product, an, iridium, chloride, salt, is, reduced, with, hydrogen, yielding, the, metal, as, a, powder, or, sponge, which, is, amenable, to, powder, metallurgy, techniques, iridium, is, also, obtained, commercially, as, a, by, product, from, nickel, and, copper, mining, and, processing, during, electrorefining, of, copper, and, nickel, noble, metals, such, as, silver, gold, and, the, platinum, group, metals, as, well, as, selenium, and, tellurium, settle, to, the, bottom, of, the, cell, as, anode, mud, which, forms, the, starting, point, for, their, extraction, due, to, iridium, s, resistance, to, corrosion, it, has, industrial, applications, the, main, areas, of, use, are, electrodes, for, producing, chlorine, and, other, corrosive, products, oleds, crucibles, catalysts, e, g, acetic, acid, and, ignition, tips, for, spark, plugs, resistance, to, heat, and, corrosion, are, the, bases, for, several, uses, of, iridium, and, its, alloys, owing, to, its, high, melting, point, hardness, and, corrosion, resistance, iridium, is, used, to, make, crucibles, such, crucibles, are, used, in, the, czochralski, process, to, produce, oxide, single, crystals, such, as, sapphires, for, use, in, computer, memory, devices, and, in, solid, state, lasers, the, crystals, such, as, gadolinium, gallium, garnet, and, yttrium, gallium, garnet, are, grown, by, melting, pre, sintered, charges, of, mixed, oxides, under, oxidizing, conditions, at, temperatures, up, to, 2, 100, c, 3, 810, f, certain, long, life, aircraft, engine, parts, are, made, of, an, iridium, alloy, and, an, iridium, titanium, alloy, is, used, for, deep, water, pipes, because, of, its, corrosion, resistance, iridium, is, used, for, multi, pored, spinnerets, through, which, a, plastic, polymer, melt, is, extruded, to, form, fibers, such, as, rayon, osmium, iridium, is, used, for, compass, bearings, and, for, balances, because, of, their, resistance, to, arc, erosion, iridium, alloys, are, used, by, some, manufacturers, for, the, centre, electrodes, of, spark, plugs, and, iridium, based, spark, plugs, are, particularly, used, in, aviation, iridium, compounds, are, used, as, catalysts, in, the, cativa, process, for, carbonylation, of, methanol, to, produce, acetic, acid, iridium, complexes, are, often, active, for, asymmetric, hydrogenation, both, by, traditional, hydrogenation, and, transfer, hydrogenation, this, property, is, the, basis, of, the, industrial, route, to, the, chiral, herbicide, s, metolachlor, as, practiced, by, syngenta, on, the, scale, of, 10, 000, tons, year, the, complex, 2, in, the, presence, of, josiphos, ligands, the, radioisotope, iridium, 192, is, one, of, the, two, most, important, sources, of, energy, for, use, in, industrial, radiography, for, non, destructive, testing, of, metals, additionally, 192, ir, is, used, as, a, source, of, gamma, radiation, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, using, brachytherapy, a, form, of, radiotherapy, where, a, sealed, radioactive, source, is, placed, inside, or, next, to, the, area, requiring, treatment, specific, treatments, include, high, dose, rate, prostate, brachytherapy, biliary, duct, brachytherapy, and, intracavitary, cervix, brachytherapy, iridium, 192, is, normally, produced, by, neutron, activation, of, isotope, iridium, 191, in, natural, abundance, iridium, metal, iridium, complexes, are, key, components, of, white, oleds, similar, complexes, are, used, in, photocatalysis, an, alloy, of, 90, platinum, and, 10, iridium, was, used, in, 1889, to, construct, the, international, prototype, meter, and, kilogram, mass, kept, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, near, paris, the, meter, bar, was, replaced, as, the, definition, of, the, fundamental, unit, of, length, in, 1960, by, a, line, in, the, atomic, spectrum, of, krypton, but, the, kilogram, prototype, remained, the, international, standard, of, mass, until, 20, may, 2019, when, the, kilogram, was, redefined, in, terms, of, the, planck, constant, iridium, osmium, alloys, were, used, in, fountain, pen, nib, tips, the, first, major, use, of, iridium, was, in, 1834, in, nibs, mounted, on, gold, starting, in, 1944, the, famous, parker, 51, fountain, pen, was, fitted, with, a, nib, tipped, by, a, ruthenium, and, iridium, alloy, with, 3, 8, iridium, the, tip, material, in, modern, fountain, pens, is, still, conventionally, called, iridium, although, there, is, seldom, any, iridium, in, it, other, metals, such, as, ruthenium, osmium, and, tungsten, have, taken, its, place, an, iridium, platinum, alloy, was, used, for, the, touch, holes, or, vent, pieces, of, cannon, according, to, a, report, of, the, paris, exhibition, of, 1867, one, of, the, pieces, being, exhibited, by, johnson, and, matthey, has, been, used, in, a, whitworth, gun, for, more, than, 3000, rounds, and, scarcely, shows, signs, of, wear, yet, those, who, know, the, constant, trouble, and, expense, which, are, occasioned, by, the, wearing, of, the, vent, pieces, of, cannon, when, in, active, service, will, appreciate, this, important, adaptation, the, pigment, iridium, black, which, consists, of, very, finely, divided, iridium, is, used, for, painting, porcelain, an, intense, black, it, was, said, that, all, other, porcelain, black, colors, appear, grey, by, the, side, of, it, iridium, in, bulk, metallic, form, is, not, biologically, important, or, hazardous, to, health, due, to, its, lack, of, reactivity, with, tissues, there, are, only, about, 20, parts, per, trillion, of, iridium, in, human, tissue, like, most, metals, finely, divided, iridium, powder, can, be, hazardous, to, handle, as, it, is, an, irritant, and, may, ignite, in, air, iridium, is, relatively, unhazardous, otherwise, with, the, only, effect, of, iridium, ingestion, being, irritation, of, the, digestive, tract, however, soluble, salts, such, as, the, iridium, halides, could, be, hazardous, due, to, elements, other, than, iridium, or, due, to, iridium, itself, at, the, same, time, most, iridium, compounds, are, insoluble, which, makes, absorption, into, the, body, difficult, a, radioisotope, of, iridium, 192, ir, is, dangerous, like, other, radioactive, isotopes, the, only, reported, injuries, related, to, iridium, concern, accidental, exposure, to, radiation, from, 192, ir, used, in, brachytherapy, high, energy, gamma, radiation, from, 192, ir, can, increase, the, risk, of, cancer, external, exposure, can, cause, burns, radiation, poisoning, and, death, ingestion, of, 192, ir, can, burn, the, linings, of, the, stomach, and, the, intestines, 192, ir, 192m, ir, and, 194m, ir, tend, to, deposit, in, the, liver, and, can, pose, health, hazards, from, both, gamma, and, beta, radiation
