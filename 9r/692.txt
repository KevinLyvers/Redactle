the, neogene, n, i, d, i, n, nee, jeen, is, a, geologic, period, and, system, that, spans, 20, 45, million, years, from, the, end, of, the, paleogene, period, 23, 03, million, years, ago, mya, to, the, beginning, of, the, present, quaternary, period, 2, 58, million, years, ago, the, neogene, is, sub, divided, into, two, epochs, the, earlier, miocene, and, the, later, pliocene, some, geologists, assert, that, the, neogene, cannot, be, clearly, delineated, from, the, modern, geological, period, the, quaternary, the, term, neogene, was, coined, in, 1853, by, the, austrian, palaeontologist, moritz, h, rnes, 1815, 1868, the, earlier, term, tertiary, period, was, used, to, define, the, span, of, time, now, covered, by, paleogene, and, neogene, and, despite, no, longer, being, recognized, as, a, formal, stratigraphic, term, tertiary, still, sometimes, remains, in, informal, use, during, this, period, mammals, and, birds, continued, to, evolve, into, modern, forms, while, other, groups, of, life, remained, relatively, unchanged, the, first, humans, homo, habilis, appeared, in, africa, near, the, end, of, the, period, some, continental, movements, took, place, the, most, significant, event, being, the, connection, of, north, and, south, america, at, the, isthmus, of, panama, late, in, the, pliocene, this, cut, off, the, warm, ocean, currents, from, the, pacific, to, the, atlantic, ocean, leaving, only, the, gulf, stream, to, transfer, heat, to, the, arctic, ocean, the, global, climate, cooled, considerably, throughout, the, neogene, culminating, in, a, series, of, continental, glaciations, in, the, quaternary, period, that, followed, in, ics, terminology, from, upper, later, more, recent, to, lower, earlier, the, pliocene, epoch, is, subdivided, into, two, ages, the, miocene, epoch, is, subdivided, into, six, ages, in, different, geophysical, regions, of, the, world, other, regional, names, are, also, used, for, the, same, or, overlapping, ages, and, other, timeline, subdivisions, the, terms, neogene, system, formal, and, upper, tertiary, system, informal, describe, the, rocks, deposited, during, the, neogene, period, the, continents, in, the, neogene, were, very, close, to, their, current, positions, the, isthmus, of, panama, formed, connecting, north, and, south, america, the, indian, subcontinent, continued, to, collide, with, asia, forming, the, himalayas, sea, levels, fell, creating, land, bridges, between, africa, and, eurasia, and, between, eurasia, and, north, america, the, global, climate, became, more, seasonal, and, continued, an, overall, drying, and, cooling, trend, which, began, during, the, paleogene, the, early, miocene, was, relatively, cool, early, miocene, mid, latitude, seawater, and, continental, thermal, gradients, were, already, very, similar, to, those, of, the, present, during, the, middle, miocene, earth, entered, a, warm, phase, known, as, the, middle, miocene, climatic, optimum, mmco, which, was, driven, by, the, emplacement, of, the, columbia, river, basalt, group, around, 11, ma, the, middle, miocene, warm, interval, gave, way, to, the, much, cooler, late, miocene, the, ice, caps, on, both, poles, began, to, grow, and, thicken, a, process, enhanced, by, positive, feedbacks, from, increased, formation, of, sea, ice, between, 7, and, 5, 3, ma, a, decrease, in, global, temperatures, termed, the, late, miocene, cooling, lmc, ensued, driven, by, decreases, in, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, during, the, pliocene, from, about, 5, 3, to, 2, 7, ma, another, warm, interval, occurred, being, known, as, the, pliocene, warm, interval, pwi, interrupting, the, longer, term, cooling, trend, the, pliocene, thermal, maximum, ptm, occurred, between, 3, 3, and, 3, 0, ma, during, the, pliocene, green, sahara, phases, of, wet, conditions, in, north, africa, were, frequent, and, occurred, about, every, 21, kyr, being, especially, intense, when, earth, s, orbit, s, eccentricity, was, high, the, pwi, had, similar, levels, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, to, contemporary, times, and, is, often, seen, as, an, analogous, climate, to, the, projected, climate, of, the, near, future, as, a, result, of, anthropogenic, global, warming, towards, the, end, of, the, pliocene, decreased, heat, transport, towards, the, antarctic, resulting, from, a, weakening, of, the, indonesian, throughflow, itf, cooled, the, earth, a, process, that, exacerbated, itself, in, a, positive, feedback, as, sea, levels, dropped, and, the, itf, diminished, and, further, limited, the, heat, transported, southward, by, the, leeuwin, current, by, the, end, of, the, period, the, first, of, a, series, of, glaciations, of, the, current, ice, age, began, marine, and, continental, flora, and, fauna, have, a, modern, appearance, the, reptile, group, choristodera, went, extinct, in, the, early, part, of, the, period, while, the, amphibians, known, as, allocaudata, disappeared, at, the, end, of, it, neogene, also, marked, the, end, of, the, reptilian, genera, langstonia, and, barinasuchus, terrestrial, predators, that, were, the, last, surviving, members, of, sebecosuchia, a, group, related, to, crocodiles, the, oceans, were, dominated, by, large, carnivores, like, megalodons, and, livyatans, and, 19, million, years, ago, about, 70, of, all, pelagic, shark, species, disappeared, mammals, and, birds, continued, to, be, the, dominant, terrestrial, vertebrates, and, took, many, forms, as, they, adapted, to, various, habitats, an, explosive, radiation, of, ursids, took, place, at, the, miocene, pliocene, boundary, the, first, hominins, the, ancestors, of, humans, may, have, appeared, in, southern, europe, and, migrated, into, africa, the, first, humans, belonging, to, the, species, homo, habilis, appeared, in, africa, near, the, end, of, the, period, about, 20, million, years, ago, gymnosperms, in, the, form, of, some, conifer, and, cycad, groups, started, to, diversify, and, produce, more, species, due, to, the, changing, conditions, in, response, to, the, cooler, seasonal, climate, tropical, plant, species, gave, way, to, deciduous, ones, and, grasslands, replaced, many, forests, grasses, therefore, greatly, diversified, and, herbivorous, mammals, evolved, alongside, it, creating, the, many, grazing, animals, of, today, such, as, horses, antelope, and, bison, ice, age, mammals, like, the, mammoths, and, woolly, rhinoceros, were, common, in, pliocene, with, lower, levels, of, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, c, 4, plants, expanded, and, reached, ecological, dominance, in, grasslands, during, the, last, 10, million, years, also, asteraceae, daisies, went, through, a, significant, adaptive, radiation, eucalyptus, fossil, leaves, occur, in, the, miocene, of, new, zealand, where, the, genus, is, not, native, today, but, have, been, introduced, from, australia, the, neogene, traditionally, ended, at, the, end, of, the, pliocene, epoch, just, before, the, older, definition, of, the, beginning, of, the, quaternary, period, many, time, scales, show, this, division, however, there, was, a, movement, amongst, geologists, particularly, marine, geologists, to, also, include, ongoing, geological, time, quaternary, in, the, neogene, while, others, particularly, terrestrial, geologists, insist, the, quaternary, to, be, a, separate, period, of, distinctly, different, record, the, somewhat, confusing, terminology, and, disagreement, amongst, geologists, on, where, to, draw, what, hierarchical, boundaries, is, due, to, the, comparatively, fine, divisibility, of, time, units, as, time, approaches, the, present, and, due, to, geological, preservation, that, causes, the, youngest, sedimentary, geological, record, to, be, preserved, over, a, much, larger, area, and, to, reflect, many, more, environments, than, the, older, geological, record, by, dividing, the, cenozoic, era, into, three, arguably, two, periods, paleogene, neogene, quaternary, instead, of, seven, epochs, the, periods, are, more, closely, comparable, to, the, duration, of, periods, in, the, mesozoic, and, paleozoic, eras, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, once, proposed, that, the, quaternary, be, considered, a, sub, era, sub, erathem, of, the, neogene, with, a, beginning, date, of, 2, 58, ma, namely, the, start, of, the, gelasian, stage, in, the, 2004, proposal, of, the, ics, the, neogene, would, have, consisted, of, the, miocene, and, pliocene, epochs, the, international, union, for, quaternary, research, inqua, counterproposed, that, the, neogene, and, the, pliocene, end, at, 2, 58, ma, that, the, gelasian, be, transferred, to, the, pleistocene, and, the, quaternary, be, recognized, as, the, third, period, in, the, cenozoic, citing, key, changes, in, earth, s, climate, oceans, and, biota, that, occurred, 2, 58, ma, and, its, correspondence, to, the, gauss, matuyama, magnetostratigraphic, boundary, in, 2006, ics, and, inqua, reached, a, compromise, that, made, quaternary, a, sub, era, subdividing, cenozoic, into, the, old, classical, tertiary, and, quaternary, a, compromise, that, was, rejected, by, international, union, of, geological, sciences, because, it, split, both, neogene, and, pliocene, in, two, following, formal, discussions, at, the, 2008, international, geological, congress, in, oslo, norway, the, ics, decided, in, may, 2009, to, make, the, quaternary, the, youngest, period, of, the, cenozoic, era, with, its, base, at, 2, 58, mya, and, including, the, gelasian, age, which, was, formerly, considered, part, of, the, neogene, period, and, pliocene, epoch, thus, the, neogene, period, ends, bounding, the, succeeding, quaternary, period, at, 2, 58, mya
