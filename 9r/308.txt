the, haber, process, also, called, the, haber, bosch, process, is, the, main, industrial, procedure, for, the, production, of, ammonia, it, converts, atmospheric, nitrogen, n, 2, to, ammonia, nh, 3, by, a, reaction, with, hydrogen, h, 2, using, a, finely, divided, iron, metal, catalyst, n, 2, 3, h, 2, 2, nh, 3, h, 92, 28, kj, h, 298, k, 46, 14, k, j, m, o, l, displaystyle, ce, n2, 3h2, 2nh3, qquad, delta, h, circ, 92, 28, ce, kj, delta, h, 298, mathrm, k, circ, 46, 14, mathrm, kj, mol, this, reaction, is, slightly, favorable, in, terms, of, enthalpy, but, is, disfavored, in, terms, of, entropy, because, four, equivalents, of, reactant, gases, are, converted, into, two, equivalents, of, product, gas, as, a, result, high, pressures, and, moderately, high, temperatures, are, needed, to, drive, the, reaction, forward, the, german, chemists, fritz, haber, and, carl, bosch, developed, the, process, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, and, its, improved, efficiency, over, existing, methods, such, as, the, birkeland, eyde, and, frank, caro, processes, was, a, major, advancement, in, the, industrial, production, of, ammonia, the, haber, process, can, be, combined, with, steam, reforming, to, produce, ammonia, with, just, three, chemical, inputs, water, natural, gas, and, atmospheric, nitrogen, both, haber, and, bosch, were, eventually, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, haber, in, 1918, for, ammonia, synthesis, specifically, and, bosch, in, 1931, for, related, contributions, to, high, pressure, chemistry, during, the, 19th, century, the, demand, for, nitrates, and, ammonia, for, use, as, fertilizers, that, supply, plants, the, nutrients, they, need, to, grow, and, industrial, feedstocks, rapidly, increased, the, main, source, was, mining, niter, deposits, and, guano, from, tropical, islands, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, these, reserves, were, thought, insufficient, to, satisfy, future, demands, and, research, into, new, potential, sources, of, ammonia, increased, although, atmospheric, nitrogen, n, 2, is, abundant, comprising, 78, of, the, air, it, is, exceptionally, stable, and, does, not, readily, react, with, other, chemicals, haber, with, his, assistant, robert, le, rossignol, developed, the, high, pressure, devices, and, catalysts, needed, to, demonstrate, the, haber, process, at, a, laboratory, scale, they, demonstrated, their, process, in, the, summer, of, 1909, by, producing, ammonia, from, the, air, drop, by, drop, at, the, rate, of, about, 125, ml, 4, us, fl, oz, per, hour, the, process, was, purchased, by, the, german, chemical, company, basf, which, assigned, carl, bosch, the, task, of, scaling, up, haber, s, tabletop, machine, to, industrial, scale, he, succeeded, in, 1910, haber, and, bosch, were, later, awarded, nobel, prizes, in, 1918, and, 1931, respectively, for, their, work, in, overcoming, the, chemical, and, engineering, problems, of, large, scale, continuous, flow, high, pressure, technology, ammonia, was, first, manufactured, using, the, haber, process, on, an, industrial, scale, in, 1913, in, basf, s, oppau, plant, in, germany, reaching, 20, tonnes, day, in, 1914, during, world, war, i, the, production, of, munitions, required, large, amounts, of, nitrate, the, allies, had, access, to, large, deposits, of, sodium, nitrate, in, chile, chile, saltpetre, controlled, by, british, companies, india, had, large, supplies, too, but, it, was, also, controlled, by, the, british, moreover, even, if, german, commercial, interests, had, nominal, legal, control, of, such, resources, the, allied, powers, controlled, the, sea, lanes, and, imposed, a, highly, effective, blockade, which, would, have, prevented, such, supplies, from, reaching, germany, the, haber, process, proved, so, essential, to, the, german, war, effort, that, it, is, considered, virtually, certain, germany, would, have, been, defeated, in, a, matter, of, months, without, it, synthetic, ammonia, from, the, haber, process, was, used, for, the, production, of, nitric, acid, a, precursor, to, the, nitrates, used, in, explosives, the, original, haber, bosch, reaction, chambers, used, osmium, as, the, catalyst, but, it, was, available, in, extremely, small, quantities, haber, noted, uranium, was, almost, as, effective, and, easier, to, obtain, than, osmium, in, 1909, basf, researcher, alwin, mittasch, discovered, a, much, less, expensive, iron, based, catalyst, that, is, still, used, a, major, contributor, to, the, elucidation, of, this, catalysis, was, gerhard, ertl, the, most, popular, catalysts, are, based, on, iron, promoted, with, k, 2, o, cao, sio, 2, and, al, 2, o, 3, during, the, interwar, years, alternative, processes, were, developed, most, notably, the, casale, process, claude, process, and, the, mont, cenis, process, developed, by, friedrich, uhde, ingenieurb, ro, luigi, casale, and, georges, claude, proposed, to, increase, the, pressure, of, the, synthesis, loop, to, 80, 100, mpa, 800, 1, 000, bar, 12, 000, 15, 000, psi, thereby, increasing, the, single, pass, ammonia, conversion, and, making, nearly, complete, liquefaction, at, ambient, temperature, feasible, claude, proposed, to, have, three, or, four, converters, with, liquefaction, steps, in, series, thereby, avoiding, recycling, most, plants, continue, to, use, the, original, haber, process, 20, mpa, 200, bar, 2, 900, psi, and, 500, c, 932, f, albeit, with, improved, single, pass, conversion, and, lower, energy, consumption, due, to, process, and, catalyst, optimization, combined, with, the, energy, needed, to, produce, hydrogen, and, purified, atmospheric, nitrogen, ammonia, production, is, energy, intensive, accounting, for, 1, to, 2, of, global, energy, consumption, 3, of, global, carbon, emissions, and, 3, to, 5, of, natural, gas, consumption, hydrogen, required, for, ammonia, synthesis, is, most, often, produced, through, gasification, of, carbon, containing, material, mostly, natural, gas, but, other, potential, carbon, sources, include, coal, petroleum, peat, biomass, or, waste, as, of, 2012, the, global, production, of, ammonia, produced, from, natural, gas, using, the, steam, reforming, process, was, 72, hydrogen, can, also, be, produced, from, water, and, electricity, using, electrolysis, at, one, time, most, of, europe, s, ammonia, was, produced, from, the, hydro, plant, at, vemork, other, possibilities, include, biological, hydrogen, production, or, photolysis, but, at, present, steam, reforming, of, natural, gas, is, the, most, economical, means, of, mass, producing, hydrogen, the, choice, of, catalyst, is, important, for, synthesizing, ammonia, in, 2012, hideo, hosono, s, group, found, that, ru, loaded, calcium, aluminum, oxide, c12a7, e, electride, works, well, as, a, catalyst, and, pursued, more, efficient, formation, this, method, is, implemented, in, a, small, plant, for, ammonia, synthesis, in, japan, in, 2019, hosono, s, group, found, another, catalyst, a, novel, perovskite, oxynitride, hydride, baceo, 3, x, n, y, h, z, that, works, at, lower, temperature, and, without, costly, ruthenium, the, major, source, of, hydrogen, is, methane, steam, reforming, of, natural, gas, extracts, hydrogen, from, methane, in, a, high, temperature, and, pressure, tube, inside, a, reformer, with, a, nickel, catalyst, other, fossil, fuel, sources, include, coal, heavy, fuel, oil, and, naphtha, green, hydrogen, is, produced, without, fossil, fuels, or, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, biomass, water, electrolysis, and, thermochemical, solar, or, another, heat, source, water, splitting, however, these, hydrogen, sources, are, not, economically, competitive, with, steam, reforming, starting, with, a, natural, gas, ch, 4, feedstock, the, steps, are, as, follows, the, hydrogen, is, catalytically, reacted, with, nitrogen, derived, from, process, air, to, form, anhydrous, liquid, ammonia, it, is, difficult, and, expensive, as, lower, temperatures, result, in, slower, reaction, kinetics, hence, a, slower, reaction, rate, and, high, pressure, requires, high, strength, pressure, vessels, that, resist, hydrogen, embrittlement, diatomic, nitrogen, is, bound, together, by, a, triple, bond, which, makes, it, relatively, inert, yield, and, efficiency, are, low, meaning, that, the, ammonia, must, be, extracted, and, the, gases, reprocessed, for, the, reaction, to, proceed, at, an, acceptable, pace, this, step, is, known, as, the, ammonia, synthesis, loop, the, gases, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, are, passed, over, four, beds, of, catalyst, with, cooling, between, each, pass, to, maintain, a, reasonable, equilibrium, constant, on, each, pass, only, about, 15, conversion, occurs, but, unreacted, gases, are, recycled, and, eventually, conversion, of, 97, is, achieved, due, to, the, nature, of, the, typically, multi, promoted, magnetite, catalyst, used, in, the, ammonia, synthesis, reaction, only, low, levels, of, oxygen, containing, especially, co, co, 2, and, h, 2, o, compounds, can, be, tolerated, in, the, hydrogen, nitrogen, mixture, relatively, pure, nitrogen, can, be, obtained, by, air, separation, but, additional, oxygen, removal, may, be, required, because, of, relatively, low, single, pass, conversion, rates, typically, less, than, 20, a, large, recycle, stream, is, required, this, can, lead, to, the, accumulation, of, inerts, in, the, gas, nitrogen, gas, n, 2, is, unreactive, because, the, atoms, are, held, together, by, triple, bonds, the, haber, process, relies, on, catalysts, that, accelerate, the, scission, of, these, bonds, two, opposing, considerations, are, relevant, the, equilibrium, position, and, the, reaction, rate, at, room, temperature, the, equilibrium, is, in, favor, of, ammonia, but, the, reaction, does, not, proceed, at, a, detectable, rate, due, to, its, high, activation, energy, because, the, reaction, is, exothermic, the, equilibrium, constant, decreases, with, increasing, temperature, following, le, ch, telier, s, principle, it, becomes, unity, at, around, 150, 200, c, 302, 392, f, above, this, temperature, the, equilibrium, quickly, becomes, unfavorable, at, atmospheric, pressure, according, to, the, van, t, hoff, equation, lowering, the, temperature, is, unhelpful, because, the, catalyst, requires, a, temperature, of, at, least, 400, c, to, be, efficient, increased, pressure, favors, the, forward, reaction, because, 4, moles, of, reactant, produce, 2, moles, of, product, and, the, pressure, used, 15, 25, mpa, 150, 250, bar, 2, 200, 3, 600, psi, alters, the, equilibrium, concentrations, to, give, a, substantial, ammonia, yield, the, reason, for, this, is, evident, in, the, equilibrium, relationship, k, y, nh, 3, 2, y, h, 2, 3, y, n, 2, nh, 3, 2, h, 2, 3, n, 2, p, p, 2, displaystyle, k, frac, y, ce, nh3, 2, y, ce, h2, 3, y, ce, n2, frac, hat, phi, ce, nh3, 2, hat, phi, ce, h2, 3,

pressurization, is, expensive, pipes, valves, and, reaction, vessels, need, to, be, strong, enough, and, safety, considerations, affect, operating, at, 20, mpa, compressors, take, considerable, energy, as, work, must, be, done, on, the, compressible, gas, thus, the, compromise, used, gives, a, single, pass, yield, of, around, 15, while, removing, the, ammonia, from, the, system, increases, the, reaction, yield, this, step, is, not, used, in, practice, since, the, temperature, is, too, high, instead, it, is, removed, from, the, gases, leaving, the, reaction, vessel, the, hot, gases, are, cooled, under, high, pressure, allowing, the, ammonia, to, condense, and, be, removed, as, a, liquid, unreacted, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, gases, are, returned, to, the, reaction, vessel, for, another, round, while, most, ammonia, is, removed, typically, down, to, 2, 5, mol, some, ammonia, remains, in, the, recycle, stream, in, academic, literature, a, more, complete, separation, of, ammonia, has, been, proposed, by, absorption, in, metal, halides, or, zeolites, such, a, process, is, called, an, absorbent, enhanced, haber, process, or, adsorbent, enhanced, haber, bosch, process, the, steam, reforming, shift, conversion, carbon, dioxide, removal, and, methanation, steps, each, operate, at, absolute, pressures, of, about, 25, to, 35, bar, while, the, ammonia, synthesis, loop, operates, at, temperatures, of, 300, 500, c, 572, 932, f, and, pressures, ranging, from, 60, to, 180, bar, depending, upon, the, method, used, the, resulting, ammonia, must, then, be, separated, from, the, residual, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, at, temperatures, of, 20, c, 4, f, the, haber, bosch, process, relies, on, catalysts, to, accelerate, n, 2, hydrogenation, the, catalysts, are, heterogeneous, solids, that, interact, with, gaseous, reagents, the, catalyst, typically, consists, of, finely, divided, iron, bound, to, an, iron, oxide, carrier, containing, promoters, possibly, including, aluminium, oxide, potassium, oxide, calcium, oxide, potassium, hydroxide, molybdenum, and, magnesium, oxide, the, iron, catalyst, is, obtained, from, finely, ground, iron, powder, which, is, usually, obtained, by, reduction, of, high, purity, magnetite, fe, 3, o, 4, the, pulverized, iron, is, oxidized, to, give, magnetite, or, w, stite, feo, ferrous, oxide, particles, of, a, specific, size, the, magnetite, or, w, stite, particles, are, then, partially, reduced, removing, some, of, the, oxygen, the, resulting, catalyst, particles, consist, of, a, core, of, magnetite, encased, in, a, shell, of, w, stite, which, in, turn, is, surrounded, by, an, outer, shell, of, metallic, iron, the, catalyst, maintains, most, of, its, bulk, volume, during, the, reduction, resulting, in, a, highly, porous, high, surface, area, material, which, enhances, its, catalytic, effectiveness, minor, components, include, calcium, and, aluminium, oxides, which, support, the, iron, catalyst, and, help, it, maintain, its, surface, area, these, oxides, of, ca, al, k, and, si, are, unreactive, to, reduction, by, hydrogen, the, production, of, the, catalyst, requires, a, particular, melting, process, in, which, used, raw, materials, must, be, free, of, catalyst, poisons, and, the, promoter, aggregates, must, be, evenly, distributed, in, the, magnetite, melt, rapid, cooling, of, the, magnetite, which, has, an, initial, temperature, of, about, 3500, c, produces, the, desired, precursor, unfortunately, the, rapid, cooling, ultimately, forms, a, catalyst, of, reduced, abrasion, resistance, despite, this, disadvantage, the, method, of, rapid, cooling, is, often, employed, the, reduction, of, the, precursor, magnetite, to, iron, is, carried, out, directly, in, the, production, plant, with, synthesis, gas, the, reduction, of, the, magnetite, proceeds, via, the, formation, of, w, stite, feo, so, that, particles, with, a, core, of, magnetite, become, surrounded, by, a, shell, of, w, stite, the, further, reduction, of, magnetite, and, w, stite, leads, to, the, formation, of, iron, which, forms, together, with, the, promoters, the, outer, shell, the, involved, processes, are, complex, and, depend, on, the, reduction, temperature, at, lower, temperatures, w, stite, disproportionates, into, an, iron, phase, and, a, magnetite, phase, at, higher, temperatures, the, reduction, of, the, w, stite, and, magnetite, to, iron, dominates, the, iron, forms, primary, crystallites, with, a, diameter, of, about, 30, nanometers, these, crystallites, form, a, bimodal, pore, system, with, pore, diameters, of, about, 10, nanometers, produced, by, the, reduction, of, the, magnetite, phase, and, of, 25, to, 50, nanometers, produced, by, the, reduction, of, the, w, stite, phase, with, the, exception, of, cobalt, oxide, the, promoters, are, not, reduced, during, the, reduction, of, the, iron, oxide, with, synthesis, gas, water, vapor, is, formed, this, water, vapor, must, be, considered, for, high, catalyst, quality, as, contact, with, the, finely, divided, iron, would, lead, to, premature, aging, of, the, catalyst, through, recrystallization, especially, in, conjunction, with, high, temperatures, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, water, in, the, gas, mixture, produced, during, catalyst, formation, is, thus, kept, as, low, as, possible, target, values, are, below, 3, gm, 3, for, this, reason, the, reduction, is, carried, out, at, high, gas, exchange, low, pressure, and, low, temperatures, the, exothermic, nature, of, the, ammonia, formation, ensures, a, gradual, increase, in, temperature, the, reduction, of, fresh, fully, oxidized, catalyst, or, precursor, to, full, production, capacity, takes, four, to, ten, days, the, w, stite, phase, is, reduced, faster, and, at, lower, temperatures, than, the, magnetite, phase, fe, 3, o, 4, after, detailed, kinetic, microscopic, and, x, ray, spectroscopic, investigations, it, was, shown, that, w, stite, reacts, first, to, metallic, iron, this, leads, to, a, gradient, of, iron, ii, ions, whereby, these, diffuse, from, the, magnetite, through, the, w, stite, to, the, particle, surface, and, precipitate, there, as, iron, nuclei, pre, reduced, stabilized, catalysts, occupy, a, significant, market, share, they, are, delivered, showing, the, fully, developed, pore, structure, but, have, been, oxidized, again, on, the, surface, after, manufacture, and, are, therefore, no, longer, pyrophoric, the, reactivation, of, such, pre, reduced, catalysts, requires, only, 30, to, 40, hours, instead, of, several, days, in, addition, to, the, short, start, up, time, they, have, other, advantages, such, as, higher, water, resistance, and, lower, weight, many, efforts, have, been, made, to, improve, the, haber, bosch, process, many, metals, were, tested, as, catalysts, the, requirement, for, suitability, is, the, dissociative, adsorption, of, nitrogen, i, e, the, nitrogen, molecule, must, be, split, into, nitrogen, atoms, upon, adsorption, if, the, binding, of, the, nitrogen, is, too, strong, the, catalyst, is, blocked, and, the, catalytic, ability, is, reduced, self, poisoning, the, elements, in, the, periodic, table, to, the, left, of, the, iron, group, show, such, strong, bonds, further, the, formation, of, surface, nitrides, makes, for, example, chromium, catalysts, ineffective, metals, to, the, right, of, the, iron, group, in, contrast, adsorb, nitrogen, too, weakly, for, ammonia, synthesis, haber, initially, used, catalysts, based, on, osmium, and, uranium, uranium, reacts, to, its, nitride, during, catalysis, while, osmium, oxide, is, rare, according, to, theoretical, and, practical, studies, improvements, over, pure, iron, are, limited, the, activity, of, iron, catalysts, is, increased, by, the, inclusion, of, cobalt, ruthenium, forms, highly, active, catalysts, allowing, milder, operating, pressures, and, temperatures, ru, based, materials, are, referred, to, as, second, generation, catalysts, such, catalysts, are, prepared, by, the, decomposition, of, triruthenium, dodecacarbonyl, on, graphite, a, drawback, of, activated, carbon, supported, ruthenium, based, catalysts, is, the, methanation, of, the, support, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, their, activity, is, strongly, dependent, on, the, catalyst, carrier, and, the, promoters, a, wide, range, of, substances, can, be, used, as, carriers, including, carbon, magnesium, oxide, aluminium, oxide, zeolites, spinels, and, boron, nitride, ruthenium, activated, carbon, based, catalysts, have, been, used, industrially, in, the, kbr, advanced, ammonia, process, kaap, since, 1992, the, carbon, carrier, is, partially, degraded, to, methane, however, this, can, be, mitigated, by, a, special, treatment, of, the, carbon, at, 1500, c, thus, prolonging, the, catalyst, lifetime, in, addition, the, finely, dispersed, carbon, poses, a, risk, of, explosion, for, these, reasons, and, due, to, its, low, acidity, magnesium, oxide, has, proven, to, be, a, good, choice, of, carrier, carriers, with, acidic, properties, extract, electrons, from, ruthenium, make, it, less, reactive, and, have, the, undesirable, effect, of, binding, ammonia, to, the, surface, catalyst, poisons, lower, catalyst, activity, they, are, usually, impurities, in, the, synthesis, gas, permanent, poisons, cause, irreversible, loss, of, catalytic, activity, while, temporary, poisons, lower, the, activity, while, present, sulfur, compounds, phosphorus, compounds, arsenic, compounds, and, chlorine, compounds, are, permanent, poisons, oxygenic, compounds, like, water, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, and, oxygen, are, temporary, poisons, although, chemically, inert, components, of, the, synthesis, gas, mixture, such, as, noble, gases, or, methane, are, not, strictly, poisons, they, accumulate, through, the, recycling, of, the, process, gases, and, thus, lower, the, partial, pressure, of, the, reactants, which, in, turn, slows, conversion, the, reaction, is, the, reaction, is, an, exothermic, equilibrium, reaction, in, which, the, gas, volume, is, reduced, the, equilibrium, constant, k, eq, of, the, reaction, see, table, and, obtained, from, since, the, reaction, is, exothermic, the, equilibrium, of, the, reaction, shifts, at, lower, temperatures, to, the, ammonia, side, furthermore, four, volumetric, units, of, the, raw, materials, produce, two, volumetric, units, of, ammonia, according, to, le, chatelier, s, principle, higher, pressure, favours, ammonia, high, pressure, is, necessary, to, ensure, sufficient, surface, coverage, of, the, catalyst, with, nitrogen, for, this, reason, a, ratio, of, nitrogen, to, hydrogen, of, 1, to, 3, a, pressure, of, 250, to, 350, bar, a, temperature, of, 450, to, 550, c, and, iron, are, optimal, the, catalyst, ferrite, fe, is, produced, in, the, reactor, by, the, reduction, of, magnetite, with, hydrogen, the, catalyst, has, its, highest, efficiency, at, temperatures, of, about, 400, to, 500, c, even, though, the, catalyst, greatly, lowers, the, activation, energy, for, the, cleavage, of, the, triple, bond, of, the, nitrogen, molecule, high, temperatures, are, still, required, for, an, appropriate, reaction, rate, at, the, industrially, used, reaction, temperature, of, 450, to, 550, c, an, optimum, between, the, decomposition, of, ammonia, into, the, starting, materials, and, the, effectiveness, of, the, catalyst, is, achieved, the, formed, ammonia, is, continuously, removed, from, the, system, the, volume, fraction, of, ammonia, in, the, gas, mixture, is, about, 20, the, inert, components, especially, the, noble, gases, such, as, argon, should, not, exceed, a, certain, content, in, order, not, to, reduce, the, partial, pressure, of, the, reactants, too, much, to, remove, the, inert, gas, components, part, of, the, gas, is, removed, and, the, argon, is, separated, in, a, gas, separation, plant, the, extraction, of, pure, argon, from, the, circulating, gas, is, carried, out, using, the, linde, process, modern, ammonia, plants, produce, more, than, 3000, tons, per, day, in, one, production, line, the, following, diagram, shows, the, set, up, of, a, haber, bosch, plant, depending, on, its, origin, the, synthesis, gas, must, first, be, freed, from, impurities, such, as, hydrogen, sulfide, or, organic, sulphur, compounds, which, act, as, a, catalyst, poison, high, concentrations, of, hydrogen, sulfide, which, occur, in, synthesis, gas, from, carbonization, coke, are, removed, in, a, wet, cleaning, stage, such, as, the, sulfosolvan, process, while, low, concentrations, are, removed, by, adsorption, on, activated, carbon, organosulfur, compounds, are, separated, by, pressure, swing, adsorption, together, with, carbon, dioxide, after, co, conversion, to, produce, hydrogen, by, steam, reforming, methane, reacts, with, water, vapor, using, a, nickel, oxide, alumina, catalyst, in, the, primary, reformer, to, form, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, the, energy, required, for, this, the, enthalpy, h, is, 206, kj, mol, the, methane, gas, reacts, in, the, primary, reformer, only, partially, to, increase, the, hydrogen, yield, and, keep, the, content, of, inert, components, i, e, methane, as, low, as, possible, the, remaining, methane, gas, is, converted, in, a, second, step, with, oxygen, to, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, in, the, secondary, reformer, the, secondary, reformer, is, supplied, with, air, as, the, oxygen, source, also, the, required, nitrogen, for, the, subsequent, ammonia, synthesis, is, added, to, the, gas, mixture, in, the, third, step, the, carbon, monoxide, is, oxidized, to, carbon, dioxide, which, is, called, co, conversion, or, water, gas, shift, reaction, carbon, monoxide, and, carbon, dioxide, would, form, carbamates, with, ammonia, which, would, clog, as, solids, pipelines, and, apparatus, within, a, short, time, in, the, following, process, step, the, carbon, dioxide, must, therefore, be, removed, from, the, gas, mixture, in, contrast, to, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, can, easily, be, removed, from, the, gas, mixture, by, gas, scrubbing, with, triethanolamine, the, gas, mixture, then, still, contains, methane, and, noble, gases, such, as, argon, which, however, behave, inertly, the, gas, mixture, is, then, compressed, to, operating, pressure, by, turbo, compressors, the, resulting, compression, heat, is, dissipated, by, heat, exchangers, it, is, used, to, preheat, raw, gases, the, actual, production, of, ammonia, takes, place, in, the, ammonia, reactor, the, first, reactors, were, bursting, under, high, pressure, because, the, atomic, hydrogen, in, the, carbonaceous, steel, partially, recombined, into, methane, and, produced, cracks, in, the, steel, bosch, therefore, developed, tube, reactors, consisting, of, a, pressure, bearing, steel, tube, in, which, a, low, carbon, iron, lining, tube, was, inserted, and, filled, with, the, catalyst, hydrogen, that, diffused, through, the, inner, steel, pipe, escaped, to, the, outside, via, thin, holes, in, the, outer, steel, jacket, the, so, called, bosch, holes, a, disadvantage, of, the, tubular, reactors, was, the, relatively, high, pressure, loss, which, had, to, be, applied, again, by, compression, the, development, of, hydrogen, resistant, chromium, molybdenum, steels, made, it, possible, to, construct, single, walled, pipes, modern, ammonia, reactors, are, designed, as, multi, storey, reactors, with, a, low, pressure, drop, in, which, the, catalysts, are, distributed, as, fills, over, about, ten, storeys, one, above, the, other, the, gas, mixture, flows, through, them, one, after, the, other, from, top, to, bottom, cold, gas, is, injected, from, the, side, for, cooling, a, disadvantage, of, this, reactor, type, is, the, incomplete, conversion, of, the, cold, gas, mixture, in, the, last, catalyst, bed, alternatively, the, reaction, mixture, between, the, catalyst, layers, is, cooled, using, heat, exchangers, whereby, the, hydrogen, nitrogen, mixture, is, preheated, to, the, reaction, temperature, reactors, of, this, type, have, three, catalyst, beds, in, addition, to, good, temperature, control, this, reactor, type, has, the, advantage, of, better, conversion, of, the, raw, material, gases, compared, to, reactors, with, cold, gas, injection, uhde, has, developed, and, is, using, an, ammonia, converter, with, three, radial, flow, catalyst, beds, and, two, internal, heat, exchangers, instead, of, axial, flow, catalyst, beds, this, further, reduces, the, pressure, drop, in, the, converter, the, reaction, product, is, continuously, removed, for, maximum, yield, the, gas, mixture, is, cooled, to, 450, c, in, a, heat, exchanger, using, water, freshly, supplied, gases, and, other, process, streams, the, ammonia, also, condenses, and, is, separated, in, a, pressure, separator, unreacted, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, are, then, compressed, back, to, the, process, by, a, circulating, gas, compressor, supplemented, with, fresh, gas, and, fed, to, the, reactor, in, a, subsequent, distillation, the, product, ammonia, is, purified, the, mechanism, of, ammonia, synthesis, contains, the, following, seven, elementary, steps, transport, and, diffusion, the, first, and, last, two, steps, are, fast, compared, to, adsorption, reaction, and, desorption, because, of, the, shell, structure, of, the, catalyst, it, is, known, from, various, investigations, that, the, rate, determining, step, of, the, ammonia, synthesis, is, the, dissociation, of, nitrogen, in, contrast, exchange, reactions, between, hydrogen, and, deuterium, on, the, haber, bosch, catalysts, still, take, place, at, temperatures, of, 196, c, 320, 8, f, at, a, measurable, rate, the, exchange, between, deuterium, and, hydrogen, on, the, ammonia, molecule, also, takes, place, at, room, temperature, since, the, adsorption, of, both, molecules, is, rapid, it, cannot, determine, the, speed, of, ammonia, synthesis, in, addition, to, the, reaction, conditions, the, adsorption, of, nitrogen, on, the, catalyst, surface, depends, on, the, microscopic, structure, of, the, catalyst, surface, iron, has, different, crystal, surfaces, whose, reactivity, is, very, different, the, fe, 111, and, fe, 211, surfaces, have, by, far, the, highest, activity, the, explanation, for, this, is, that, only, these, surfaces, have, so, called, c7, sites, these, are, iron, atoms, with, seven, closest, neighbours, the, dissociative, adsorption, of, nitrogen, on, the, surface, follows, the, following, scheme, where, s, symbolizes, an, iron, atom, on, the, surface, of, the, catalyst, the, adsorption, of, nitrogen, is, similar, to, the, chemisorption, of, carbon, monoxide, on, a, fe, 111, surface, the, adsorption, of, nitrogen, first, leads, to, an, adsorbed, species, with, an, adsorption, energy, of, 24, kjmol, 1, and, an, n, n, stretch, vibration, of, 2100, cm, 1, since, the, nitrogen, is, isoelectronic, to, carbon, monoxide, it, adsorbs, in, an, on, end, configuration, in, which, the, molecule, is, bound, perpendicular, to, the, metal, surface, at, one, nitrogen, atom, this, has, been, confirmed, by, photoelectron, spectroscopy, ab, initio, mo, calculations, have, shown, that, in, addition, to, the, binding, of, the, free, electron, pair, of, nitrogen, to, the, metal, there, is, a, binding, from, the, d, orbitals, of, the, metal, to, the, orbitals, of, nitrogen, which, strengthens, the, iron, nitrogen, bond, the, nitrogen, in, the, state, is, more, strongly, bound, with, 31, kjmol, 1, the, resulting, n, n, bond, weakening, could, be, experimentally, confirmed, by, a, reduction, of, the, wave, numbers, of, the, n, n, stretching, oscillation, to, 1490, cm, 1, further, heating, of, the, fe, 111, area, covered, by, n, 2, leads, to, both, desorption, and, the, emergence, of, a, new, band, at, 450, cm, 1, this, represents, a, metal, nitrogen, oscillation, the, state, a, comparison, with, vibration, spectra, of, complex, compounds, allows, the, conclusion, that, the, n, 2, molecule, is, bound, side, on, with, an, n, atom, in, contact, with, a, c7, site, this, structure, is, called, surface, nitride, the, surface, nitride, is, very, strongly, bound, to, the, surface, hydrogen, atoms, h, ads, which, are, very, mobile, on, the, catalyst, surface, quickly, combine, with, it, infrared, spectroscopically, detected, surface, imides, nh, ad, surface, amides, nh, 2, ad, and, surface, ammoniacates, nh, 3, ad, are, formed, the, latter, decay, under, nh, 3, release, desorption, the, individual, molecules, were, identified, or, assigned, by, x, ray, photoelectron, spectroscopy, xps, high, resolution, electron, energy, loss, spectroscopy, hreels, and, ir, spectroscopy, on, the, basis, of, these, experimental, findings, the, reaction, mechanism, is, believed, to, involve, the, following, steps, see, also, figure, reaction, 5, occurs, in, three, steps, forming, nh, nh, 2, and, then, nh, 3, experimental, evidence, points, to, reaction, 2, as, being, slow, rate, determining, step, this, is, not, unexpected, since, that, step, breaks, the, nitrogen, triple, bond, the, strongest, of, the, bonds, broken, in, the, process, as, with, all, haber, bosch, catalysts, nitrogen, dissociation, is, the, rate, determining, step, for, ruthenium, activated, carbon, catalysts, the, active, center, for, ruthenium, is, a, so, called, b5, site, a, 5, fold, coordinated, position, on, the, ru, 0001, surface, where, two, ruthenium, atoms, form, a, step, edge, with, three, ruthenium, atoms, on, the, ru, 0001, surface, the, number, of, b5, sites, depends, on, the, size, and, shape, of, the, ruthenium, particles, the, ruthenium, precursor, and, the, amount, of, ruthenium, used, the, reinforcing, effect, of, the, basic, carrier, used, in, the, ruthenium, catalyst, is, similar, to, the, promoter, effect, of, alkali, metals, used, in, the, iron, catalyst, an, energy, diagram, can, be, created, based, on, the, enthalpy, of, reaction, of, the, individual, steps, the, energy, diagram, can, be, used, to, compare, homogeneous, and, heterogeneous, reactions, due, to, the, high, activation, energy, of, the, dissociation, of, nitrogen, the, homogeneous, gas, phase, reaction, is, not, realizable, the, catalyst, avoids, this, problem, as, the, energy, gain, resulting, from, the, binding, of, nitrogen, atoms, to, the, catalyst, surface, overcompensates, for, the, necessary, dissociation, energy, so, that, the, reaction, is, finally, exothermic, nevertheless, the, dissociative, adsorption, of, nitrogen, remains, the, rate, determining, step, not, because, of, the, activation, energy, but, mainly, because, of, the, unfavorable, pre, exponential, factor, of, the, rate, constant, although, hydrogenation, is, endothermic, this, energy, can, easily, be, applied, by, the, reaction, temperature, about, 700, k, when, first, invented, the, haber, process, competed, against, another, industrial, process, the, cyanamide, process, however, the, cyanamide, process, consumed, large, amounts, of, electrical, power, and, was, more, labor, intensive, than, the, haber, process, 137, 143, as, of, 2018, the, haber, process, produces, 230, million, tonnes, of, anhydrous, ammonia, per, year, the, ammonia, is, used, mainly, as, a, nitrogen, fertilizer, as, ammonia, itself, in, the, form, of, ammonium, nitrate, and, as, urea, the, haber, process, consumes, 3, 5, of, the, world, s, natural, gas, production, around, 1, 2, of, the, world, s, energy, supply, in, combination, with, advances, in, breeding, herbicides, and, pesticides, these, fertilizers, have, helped, to, increase, the, productivity, of, agricultural, land, with, average, crop, yields, remaining, at, the, 1900, level, the, crop, harvest, in, the, year, 2000, would, have, required, nearly, four, times, more, land, and, the, cultivated, area, would, have, claimed, nearly, half, of, all, ice, free, continents, rather, than, under, 15, of, the, total, land, area, that, is, required, today, the, energy, intensity, of, the, process, contributes, to, climate, change, and, other, environmental, problems, such, as, the, leaching, of, nitrates, into, groundwater, rivers, ponds, and, lakes, expanding, dead, zones, in, coastal, ocean, waters, resulting, from, recurrent, eutrophication, atmospheric, deposition, of, nitrates, and, ammonia, affecting, natural, ecosystems, higher, emissions, of, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, now, the, third, most, important, greenhouse, gas, following, co, 2, and, ch, 4, the, haber, bosch, process, is, one, of, the, largest, contributors, to, a, buildup, of, reactive, nitrogen, in, the, biosphere, causing, an, anthropogenic, disruption, to, the, nitrogen, cycle, since, nitrogen, use, efficiency, is, typically, less, than, 50, farm, runoff, from, heavy, use, of, fixed, industrial, nitrogen, disrupts, biological, habitats, nearly, 50, of, the, nitrogen, found, in, human, tissues, originated, from, the, haber, bosch, process, thus, the, haber, process, serves, as, the, detonator, of, the, population, explosion, enabling, the, global, population, to, increase, from, 1, 6, billion, in, 1900, to, 7, 7, billion, by, november, 2018, reverse, fuel, cell, technology, converts, electric, energy, water, and, nitrogen, into, ammonia, without, a, separate, hydrogen, electrolysis, process, the, use, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilisers, reduces, the, incentive, for, farmers, to, use, more, sustainable, crop, rotations, which, include, legumes, for, their, natural, nitrogen, fixing, ability
