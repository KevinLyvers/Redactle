a, chemical, substance, is, a, unique, form, of, matter, with, constant, chemical, composition, and, characteristic, properties, chemical, substances, may, take, the, form, of, a, single, element, or, chemical, compounds, if, two, or, more, chemical, substances, can, be, combined, without, reacting, they, may, form, a, chemical, mixture, if, a, mixture, is, separated, to, isolate, one, chemical, substance, to, a, desired, degree, the, resulting, substance, is, said, to, be, chemically, pure, chemical, substances, can, exist, in, several, different, physical, states, or, phases, e, g, solids, liquids, gases, or, plasma, without, changing, their, chemical, composition, substances, transition, between, these, phases, of, matter, in, response, to, changes, in, temperature, or, pressure, some, chemical, substances, can, be, combined, or, converted, into, new, substances, by, means, of, chemical, reactions, chemicals, that, do, not, possess, this, ability, are, said, to, be, inert, pure, water, is, an, example, of, a, chemical, substance, with, a, constant, composition, of, two, hydrogen, atoms, bonded, to, a, single, oxygen, atom, i, e, h, 2, o, the, atomic, ratio, of, hydrogen, to, oxygen, is, always, 2, 1, in, every, molecule, of, water, pure, water, will, tend, to, boil, near, 100, c, 212, f, an, example, of, one, of, the, characteristic, properties, that, define, it, other, notable, chemical, substances, include, diamond, a, form, of, the, element, carbon, table, salt, nacl, an, ionic, compound, and, refined, sugar, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, an, organic, compound, in, addition, to, the, generic, definition, offered, above, there, are, several, niche, fields, where, the, term, chemical, substance, may, take, alternate, usages, that, are, widely, accepted, some, of, which, are, outlined, in, the, sections, below, chemical, abstracts, service, cas, lists, several, alloys, of, uncertain, composition, within, their, chemical, substance, index, while, an, alloy, could, be, more, closely, defined, as, a, mixture, referencing, them, in, the, chemical, substances, index, allows, cas, to, offer, specific, guidance, on, standard, naming, of, alloy, compositions, non, stoichiometric, compounds, are, another, special, case, from, inorganic, chemistry, which, violate, the, requirement, for, constant, composition, for, these, substances, it, may, be, difficult, to, draw, the, line, between, a, mixture, and, a, compound, as, in, the, case, of, palladium, hydride, broader, definitions, of, chemicals, or, chemical, substances, can, be, found, for, example, the, term, chemical, substance, means, any, organic, or, inorganic, substance, of, a, particular, molecular, identity, including, i, any, combination, of, such, substances, occurring, in, whole, or, in, part, as, a, result, of, a, chemical, reaction, or, occurring, in, nature, in, the, field, of, geology, inorganic, solid, substances, of, uniform, composition, are, known, as, minerals, when, two, or, more, minerals, are, combined, to, form, mixtures, or, aggregates, they, are, defined, as, rocks, many, minerals, however, mutually, dissolve, into, solid, solutions, such, that, a, single, rock, is, a, uniform, substance, despite, being, a, mixture, in, stoichiometric, terms, feldspars, are, a, common, example, anorthoclase, is, an, alkali, aluminum, silicate, where, the, alkali, metal, is, interchangeably, either, sodium, or, potassium, in, law, chemical, substances, may, include, both, pure, substances, and, mixtures, with, a, defined, composition, or, manufacturing, process, for, example, the, eu, regulation, reach, defines, monoconstituent, substances, multiconstituent, substances, and, substances, of, unknown, or, variable, composition, the, latter, two, consist, of, multiple, chemical, substances, however, their, identity, can, be, established, either, by, direct, chemical, analysis, or, reference, to, a, single, manufacturing, process, for, example, charcoal, is, an, extremely, complex, partially, polymeric, mixture, that, can, be, defined, by, its, manufacturing, process, therefore, although, the, exact, chemical, identity, is, unknown, identification, can, be, made, with, a, sufficient, accuracy, the, cas, index, also, includes, mixtures, polymers, almost, always, appear, as, mixtures, of, molecules, of, multiple, molar, masses, each, of, which, could, be, considered, a, separate, chemical, substance, however, the, polymer, may, be, defined, by, a, known, precursor, or, reaction, s, and, the, molar, mass, distribution, for, example, polyethylene, is, a, mixture, of, very, long, chains, of, ch, 2, repeating, units, and, is, generally, sold, in, several, molar, mass, distributions, ldpe, mdpe, hdpe, and, uhmwpe, the, concept, of, a, chemical, substance, became, firmly, established, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, after, work, by, the, chemist, joseph, proust, on, the, composition, of, some, pure, chemical, compounds, such, as, basic, copper, carbonate, he, deduced, that, all, samples, of, a, compound, have, the, same, composition, that, is, all, samples, have, the, same, proportions, by, mass, of, the, elements, present, in, the, compound, this, is, now, known, as, the, law, of, constant, composition, later, with, the, advancement, of, methods, for, chemical, synthesis, particularly, in, the, realm, of, organic, chemistry, the, discovery, of, many, more, chemical, elements, and, new, techniques, in, the, realm, of, analytical, chemistry, used, for, isolation, and, purification, of, elements, and, compounds, from, chemicals, that, led, to, the, establishment, of, modern, chemistry, the, concept, was, defined, as, is, found, in, most, chemistry, textbooks, however, there, are, some, controversies, regarding, this, definition, mainly, because, the, large, number, of, chemical, substances, reported, in, chemistry, literature, need, to, be, indexed, isomerism, caused, much, consternation, to, early, researchers, since, isomers, have, exactly, the, same, composition, but, differ, in, configuration, arrangement, of, the, atoms, for, example, there, was, much, speculation, about, the, chemical, identity, of, benzene, until, the, correct, structure, was, described, by, friedrich, august, kekul, likewise, the, idea, of, stereoisomerism, that, atoms, have, rigid, three, dimensional, structure, and, can, thus, form, isomers, that, differ, only, in, their, three, dimensional, arrangement, was, another, crucial, step, in, understanding, the, concept, of, distinct, chemical, substances, for, example, tartaric, acid, has, three, distinct, isomers, a, pair, of, diastereomers, with, one, diastereomer, forming, two, enantiomers, an, element, is, a, chemical, substance, made, up, of, a, particular, kind, of, atom, and, hence, cannot, be, broken, down, or, transformed, by, a, chemical, reaction, into, a, different, element, though, it, can, be, transmuted, into, another, element, through, a, nuclear, reaction, this, is, because, all, of, the, atoms, in, a, sample, of, an, element, have, the, same, number, of, protons, though, they, may, be, different, isotopes, with, differing, numbers, of, neutrons, as, of, 2019, there, are, 118, known, elements, about, 80, of, which, are, stable, that, is, they, do, not, change, by, radioactive, decay, into, other, elements, some, elements, can, occur, as, more, than, a, single, chemical, substance, allotropes, for, instance, oxygen, exists, as, both, diatomic, oxygen, o, 2, and, ozone, o, 3, the, majority, of, elements, are, classified, as, metals, these, are, elements, with, a, characteristic, lustre, such, as, iron, copper, and, gold, metals, typically, conduct, electricity, and, heat, well, and, they, are, malleable, and, ductile, around, 14, to, 21, elements, such, as, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, are, classified, as, non, metals, non, metals, lack, the, metallic, properties, described, above, they, also, have, a, high, electronegativity, and, a, tendency, to, form, negative, ions, certain, elements, such, as, silicon, sometimes, resemble, metals, and, sometimes, resemble, non, metals, and, are, known, as, metalloids, a, chemical, compound, is, a, chemical, substance, that, is, composed, of, a, particular, set, of, atoms, or, ions, two, or, more, elements, combined, into, one, substance, through, a, chemical, reaction, form, a, chemical, compound, all, compounds, are, substances, but, not, all, substances, are, compounds, a, chemical, compound, can, be, either, atoms, bonded, together, in, molecules, or, crystals, in, which, atoms, molecules, or, ions, form, a, crystalline, lattice, compounds, based, primarily, on, carbon, and, hydrogen, atoms, are, called, organic, compounds, and, all, others, are, called, inorganic, compounds, compounds, containing, bonds, between, carbon, and, a, metal, are, called, organometallic, compounds, compounds, in, which, components, share, electrons, are, known, as, covalent, compounds, compounds, consisting, of, oppositely, charged, ions, are, known, as, ionic, compounds, or, salts, coordination, complexes, are, compounds, where, a, dative, bond, keeps, the, substance, together, without, a, covalent, or, ionic, bond, coordination, complexes, are, distinct, substances, with, distinct, properties, different, from, a, simple, mixture, typically, these, have, a, metal, such, as, a, copper, ion, in, the, center, and, a, nonmetals, atom, such, as, the, nitrogen, in, an, ammonia, molecule, or, oxygen, in, water, in, a, water, molecule, forms, a, dative, bond, to, the, metal, center, e, g, tetraamminecopper, ii, sulfate, so, 4, h, 2, o, the, metal, is, known, as, a, metal, center, and, the, substance, that, coordinates, to, the, center, is, called, a, ligand, however, the, center, does, not, need, to, be, a, metal, as, exemplified, by, boron, trifluoride, etherate, bf, 3, oet, 2, where, the, highly, lewis, acidic, but, non, metallic, boron, center, takes, the, role, of, the, metal, if, the, ligand, bonds, to, the, metal, center, with, multiple, atoms, the, complex, is, called, a, chelate, in, organic, chemistry, there, can, be, more, than, one, chemical, compound, with, the, same, composition, and, molecular, weight, generally, these, are, called, isomers, isomers, usually, have, substantially, different, chemical, properties, and, often, may, be, isolated, without, spontaneously, interconverting, a, common, example, is, glucose, vs, fructose, the, former, is, an, aldehyde, the, latter, is, a, ketone, their, interconversion, requires, either, enzymatic, or, acid, base, catalysis, however, tautomers, are, an, exception, the, isomerization, occurs, spontaneously, in, ordinary, conditions, such, that, a, pure, substance, cannot, be, isolated, into, its, tautomers, even, if, these, can, be, identified, spectroscopically, or, even, isolated, in, special, conditions, a, common, example, is, glucose, which, has, open, chain, and, ring, forms, one, cannot, manufacture, pure, open, chain, glucose, because, glucose, spontaneously, cyclizes, to, the, hemiacetal, form, all, matter, consists, of, various, elements, and, chemical, compounds, but, these, are, often, intimately, mixed, together, mixtures, contain, more, than, one, chemical, substance, and, they, do, not, have, a, fixed, composition, butter, soil, and, wood, are, common, examples, of, mixtures, sometimes, mixtures, can, be, separated, into, their, component, substances, by, mechanical, processes, such, as, chromatography, distillation, or, evaporation, grey, iron, metal, and, yellow, sulfur, are, both, chemical, elements, and, they, can, be, mixed, together, in, any, ratio, to, form, a, yellow, grey, mixture, no, chemical, process, occurs, and, the, material, can, be, identified, as, a, mixture, by, the, fact, that, the, sulfur, and, the, iron, can, be, separated, by, a, mechanical, process, such, as, using, a, magnet, to, attract, the, iron, away, from, the, sulfur, in, contrast, if, iron, and, sulfur, are, heated, together, in, a, certain, ratio, 1, atom, of, iron, for, each, atom, of, sulfur, or, by, weight, 56, grams, 1, mol, of, iron, to, 32, grams, 1, mol, of, sulfur, a, chemical, reaction, takes, place, and, a, new, substance, is, formed, the, compound, iron, ii, sulfide, with, chemical, formula, fes, the, resulting, compound, has, all, the, properties, of, a, chemical, substance, and, is, not, a, mixture, iron, ii, sulfide, has, its, own, distinct, properties, such, as, melting, point, and, solubility, and, the, two, elements, cannot, be, separated, using, normal, mechanical, processes, a, magnet, will, be, unable, to, recover, the, iron, since, there, is, no, metallic, iron, present, in, the, compound, while, the, term, chemical, substance, is, a, precise, technical, term, that, is, synonymous, with, chemical, for, chemists, the, word, chemical, is, used, in, general, usage, to, refer, to, both, pure, chemical, substances, and, mixtures, often, called, compounds, and, especially, when, produced, or, purified, in, a, laboratory, or, an, industrial, process, in, other, words, the, chemical, substances, of, which, fruits, and, vegetables, for, example, are, naturally, composed, even, when, growing, wild, are, not, called, chemicals, in, general, usage, in, countries, that, require, a, list, of, ingredients, in, products, the, chemicals, listed, are, industrially, produced, chemical, substances, the, word, chemical, is, also, often, used, to, refer, to, addictive, narcotic, or, mind, altering, drugs, within, the, chemical, industry, manufactured, chemicals, are, chemical, substances, which, can, be, classified, by, production, volume, into, bulk, chemicals, fine, chemicals, and, chemicals, found, in, research, only, the, cause, of, the, difference, in, production, volume, is, the, complexity, of, the, molecular, structure, of, the, chemical, bulk, chemicals, are, usually, much, less, complex, while, fine, chemicals, may, be, more, complex, many, of, them, are, simple, enough, to, be, sold, as, building, blocks, in, the, synthesis, of, more, complex, molecules, targeted, for, single, use, as, named, above, the, production, of, a, chemical, includes, not, only, its, synthesis, but, also, its, purification, to, eliminate, by, products, and, impurities, involved, in, the, synthesis, the, last, step, in, production, should, be, the, analysis, of, batch, lots, of, chemicals, in, order, to, identify, and, quantify, the, percentages, of, impurities, for, the, buyer, of, the, chemicals, the, required, purity, and, analysis, depends, on, the, application, but, higher, tolerance, of, impurities, is, usually, expected, in, the, production, of, bulk, chemicals, thus, the, user, of, the, chemical, in, the, us, might, choose, between, the, bulk, or, technical, grade, with, higher, amounts, of, impurities, or, a, much, purer, pharmaceutical, grade, labeled, usp, united, states, pharmacopeia, chemicals, in, the, commercial, and, legal, sense, may, also, include, mixtures, of, highly, variable, composition, as, they, are, products, made, to, a, technical, specification, instead, of, particular, chemical, substances, for, example, gasoline, is, not, a, single, chemical, compound, or, even, a, particular, mixture, different, gasolines, can, have, very, different, chemical, compositions, as, gasoline, is, primarily, defined, through, source, properties, and, octane, rating, every, chemical, substance, has, one, or, more, systematic, names, usually, named, according, to, the, iupac, rules, for, naming, an, alternative, system, is, used, by, the, chemical, abstracts, service, cas, many, compounds, are, also, known, by, their, more, common, simpler, names, many, of, which, predate, the, systematic, name, for, example, the, long, known, sugar, glucose, is, now, systematically, named, 6, hydroxymethyl, oxane, 2, 3, 4, 5, tetrol, natural, products, and, pharmaceuticals, are, also, given, simpler, names, for, example, the, mild, pain, killer, naproxen, is, the, more, common, name, for, the, chemical, compound, s, 6, methoxy, methyl, 2, naphthaleneacetic, acid, chemists, frequently, refer, to, chemical, compounds, using, chemical, formulae, or, molecular, structure, of, the, compound, there, has, been, a, phenomenal, growth, in, the, number, of, chemical, compounds, being, synthesized, or, isolated, and, then, reported, in, the, scientific, literature, by, professional, chemists, around, the, world, an, enormous, number, of, chemical, compounds, are, possible, through, the, chemical, combination, of, the, known, chemical, elements, as, of, feb, 2021, about, 177, million, organic, and, inorganic, substances, including, 68, million, defined, sequence, biopolymers, are, in, the, scientific, literature, and, registered, in, public, databases, the, names, of, many, of, these, compounds, are, often, nontrivial, and, hence, not, very, easy, to, remember, or, cite, accurately, also, it, is, difficult, to, keep, track, of, them, in, the, literature, several, international, organizations, like, iupac, and, cas, have, initiated, steps, to, make, such, tasks, easier, cas, provides, the, abstracting, services, of, the, chemical, literature, and, provides, a, numerical, identifier, known, as, cas, registry, number, to, each, chemical, substance, that, has, been, reported, in, the, chemical, literature, such, as, chemistry, journals, and, patents, this, information, is, compiled, as, a, database, and, is, popularly, known, as, the, chemical, substances, index, other, computer, friendly, systems, that, have, been, developed, for, substance, information, are, smiles, and, the, international, chemical, identifier, or, inchi, often, a, pure, substance, needs, to, be, isolated, from, a, mixture, for, example, from, a, natural, source, where, a, sample, often, contains, numerous, chemical, substances, or, after, a, chemical, reaction, which, often, gives, mixtures, of, chemical, substances, stoichiometry, s, t, k, i, m, t, r, i, is, the, relationship, between, the, weights, of, reactants, and, products, before, during, and, following, chemical, reactions, stoichiometry, is, founded, on, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, where, the, total, mass, of, the, reactants, equals, the, total, mass, of, the, products, leading, to, the, insight, that, the, relations, among, quantities, of, reactants, and, products, typically, form, a, ratio, of, positive, integers, this, means, that, if, the, amounts, of, the, separate, reactants, are, known, then, the, amount, of, the, product, can, be, calculated, conversely, if, one, reactant, has, a, known, quantity, and, the, quantity, of, the, products, can, be, empirically, determined, then, the, amount, of, the, other, reactants, can, also, be, calculated, this, is, illustrated, in, the, image, here, where, the, balanced, equation, is, here, one, molecule, of, methane, reacts, with, two, molecules, of, oxygen, gas, to, yield, one, molecule, of, carbon, dioxide, and, two, molecules, of, water, this, particular, chemical, equation, is, an, example, of, complete, combustion, stoichiometry, measures, these, quantitative, relationships, and, is, used, to, determine, the, amount, of, products, and, reactants, that, are, produced, or, needed, in, a, given, reaction, describing, the, quantitative, relationships, among, substances, as, they, participate, in, chemical, reactions, is, known, as, reaction, stoichiometry, in, the, example, above, reaction, stoichiometry, measures, the, relationship, between, the, quantities, of, methane, and, oxygen, that, react, to, form, carbon, dioxide, and, water, because, of, the, well, known, relationship, of, moles, to, atomic, weights, the, ratios, that, are, arrived, at, by, stoichiometry, can, be, used, to, determine, quantities, by, weight, in, a, reaction, described, by, a, balanced, equation, this, is, called, composition, stoichiometry
