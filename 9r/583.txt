ruby, is, a, pinkish, red, to, blood, red, colored, gemstone, a, variety, of, the, mineral, corundum, aluminium, oxide, ruby, is, one, of, the, most, popular, traditional, jewelry, gems, and, is, very, durable, other, varieties, of, gem, quality, corundum, are, called, sapphires, ruby, is, one, of, the, traditional, cardinal, gems, alongside, amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and, diamond, the, word, ruby, comes, from, ruber, latin, for, red, the, color, of, a, ruby, is, due, to, the, element, chromium, some, gemstones, that, are, popularly, or, historically, called, rubies, such, as, the, black, prince, s, ruby, in, the, british, imperial, state, crown, are, actually, spinels, these, were, once, known, as, balas, rubies, the, quality, of, a, ruby, is, determined, by, its, color, cut, and, clarity, which, along, with, carat, weight, affect, its, value, the, brightest, and, most, valuable, shade, of, red, called, blood, red, or, pigeon, blood, commands, a, large, premium, over, other, rubies, of, similar, quality, after, color, follows, clarity, similar, to, diamonds, a, clear, stone, will, command, a, premium, but, a, ruby, without, any, needle, like, rutile, inclusions, may, indicate, that, the, stone, has, been, treated, ruby, is, the, traditional, birthstone, for, july, and, is, usually, pinker, than, garnet, although, some, rhodolite, garnets, have, a, similar, pinkish, hue, to, most, rubies, the, world, s, most, valuable, ruby, to, be, sold, at, auction, is, the, sunrise, ruby, which, sold, for, us, 34, 8, million, rubies, have, a, hardness, of, 9, 0, on, the, mohs, scale, of, mineral, hardness, among, the, natural, gems, only, moissanite, and, diamond, are, harder, with, diamond, having, a, mohs, hardness, of, 10, 0, and, moissanite, falling, somewhere, in, between, corundum, ruby, and, diamond, in, hardness, sapphire, ruby, and, pure, corundum, are, alumina, the, most, stable, form, of, al, 2, o, 3, in, which, 3, electrons, leave, each, aluminium, ion, to, join, the, regular, octahedral, group, of, six, nearby, o, 2, ions, in, pure, corundum, this, leaves, all, of, the, aluminium, ions, with, a, very, stable, configuration, of, no, unpaired, electrons, or, unfilled, energy, levels, and, the, crystal, is, perfectly, colorless, and, transparent, except, for, flaws, when, a, chromium, atom, replaces, an, occasional, aluminium, atom, it, too, loses, 3, electrons, to, become, a, chromium, 3, ion, to, maintain, the, charge, balance, of, the, al, 2, o, 3, crystal, however, the, cr, 3, ions, are, larger, and, have, electron, orbitals, in, different, directions, than, aluminium, the, octahedral, arrangement, of, the, o, 2, ions, is, distorted, and, the, energy, levels, of, the, different, orbitals, of, those, cr, 3, ions, are, slightly, altered, because, of, the, directions, to, the, o, 2, ions, those, energy, differences, correspond, to, absorption, in, the, ultraviolet, violet, and, yellow, green, regions, of, the, spectrum, if, one, percent, of, the, aluminium, ions, are, replaced, by, chromium, in, ruby, the, yellow, green, absorption, results, in, a, red, color, for, the, gem, additionally, absorption, at, any, of, the, above, wavelengths, stimulates, fluorescent, emission, of, 694, nanometer, wavelength, red, light, which, adds, to, its, red, color, and, perceived, luster, the, chromium, concentration, in, artificial, rubies, can, be, adjusted, in, the, crystal, growth, process, to, be, ten, to, twenty, times, less, than, in, the, natural, gemstones, theodore, maiman, says, that, because, of, the, low, chromium, level, in, these, crystals, they, display, a, lighter, red, color, than, gemstone, ruby, and, are, referred, to, as, pink, ruby, after, absorbing, short, wavelength, light, there, is, a, short, interval, of, time, when, the, crystal, lattice, of, ruby, is, in, an, excited, state, before, fluorescence, occurs, if, 694, nanometer, photons, pass, through, the, crystal, during, that, time, they, can, stimulate, more, fluorescent, photons, to, be, emitted, in, phase, with, them, thus, strengthening, the, intensity, of, that, red, light, by, arranging, mirrors, or, other, means, to, pass, emitted, light, repeatedly, through, the, crystal, a, ruby, laser, in, this, way, produces, a, very, high, intensity, of, coherent, red, light, all, natural, rubies, have, imperfections, in, them, including, color, impurities, and, inclusions, of, rutile, needles, known, as, silk, gemologists, use, these, needle, inclusions, found, in, natural, rubies, to, distinguish, them, from, synthetics, simulants, or, substitutes, usually, the, rough, stone, is, heated, before, cutting, these, days, almost, all, rubies, are, treated, in, some, form, with, heat, treatment, being, the, most, common, practice, untreated, rubies, of, high, quality, command, a, large, premium, some, rubies, show, a, three, point, or, six, point, asterism, or, star, these, rubies, are, cut, into, cabochons, to, display, the, effect, properly, asterisms, are, best, visible, with, a, single, light, source, and, move, across, the, stone, as, the, light, moves, or, the, stone, is, rotated, such, effects, occur, when, light, is, reflected, off, the, silk, the, structurally, oriented, rutile, needle, inclusions, in, a, certain, way, this, is, one, example, where, inclusions, increase, the, value, of, a, gemstone, furthermore, rubies, can, show, color, changes, though, this, occurs, very, rarely, as, well, as, chatoyancy, or, the, cat, s, eye, effect, generally, gemstone, quality, corundum, in, all, shades, of, red, including, pink, are, called, rubies, however, in, the, united, states, a, minimum, color, saturation, must, be, met, to, be, called, a, ruby, otherwise, the, stone, will, be, called, a, pink, sapphire, drawing, a, distinction, between, rubies, and, pink, sapphires, is, relatively, new, having, arisen, sometime, in, the, 20th, century, often, the, distinction, between, ruby, and, pink, sapphire, is, not, clear, and, can, be, debated, as, a, result, of, the, difficulty, and, subjectiveness, of, such, distinctions, trade, organizations, such, as, the, international, colored, gemstone, association, icga, have, adopted, the, broader, definition, for, ruby, which, encompasses, its, lighter, shades, including, pink, historically, rubies, have, been, mined, in, thailand, in, the, pailin, and, samlout, district, of, cambodia, as, well, as, in, afghanistan, australia, brazil, colombia, india, namibia, japan, and, scotland, after, the, second, world, war, ruby, deposits, were, found, in, madagascar, mozambique, nepal, pakistan, tajikistan, tanzania, and, vietnam, the, republic, of, north, macedonia, is, the, only, country, in, mainland, europe, to, have, naturally, occurring, rubies, they, can, mainly, be, found, around, the, city, of, prilep, macedonian, rubies, have, a, unique, raspberry, color, a, few, rubies, have, been, found, in, the, u, s, states, of, montana, north, carolina, south, carolina, and, wyoming, spinel, another, red, gemstone, is, sometimes, found, along, with, rubies, in, the, same, gem, gravel, or, marble, red, spinels, may, be, mistaken, for, rubies, by, those, lacking, experience, with, gems, however, the, finest, red, spinels, now, heavily, sought, can, have, values, approaching, all, but, the, finest, examples, of, ruby, the, mogok, valley, in, upper, myanmar, burma, was, for, centuries, the, world, s, main, source, for, rubies, that, region, has, produced, some, exceptional, rubies, however, in, recent, years, few, good, rubies, have, been, found, in, central, myanmar, the, area, of, mong, hsu, began, producing, rubies, during, the, 1990s, and, rapidly, became, the, world, s, main, ruby, mining, area, the, most, recently, found, ruby, deposit, in, myanmar, is, in, namya, namyazeik, located, in, the, northern, state, of, kachin, in, pakistani, kashmir, there, are, vast, proven, reserves, of, millions, of, rubies, worth, up, to, half, a, billion, dollars, however, as, of, 2017, there, was, only, one, mine, at, chitta, katha, due, to, lack, of, investment, in, afghanistan, rubies, are, mined, at, jegdalek, in, 2017, the, aappaluttoq, mine, in, greenland, began, running, the, rubies, in, greenland, are, said, to, be, among, the, oldest, in, the, world, at, approximately, 3, billion, years, old, the, aappaluttoq, mine, in, greenland, is, located, 160, kilometers, south, of, nuuk, the, capital, of, greenland, the, rubies, are, traceable, from, mine, to, market, the, montepuez, ruby, mine, in, northeastern, mozambique, is, situated, on, one, of, the, most, significant, ruby, deposits, in, the, world, although, rubies, were, only, discovered, here, for, the, first, time, in, 2009, in, less, than, a, decade, mozambique, has, become, the, world, s, most, productive, source, for, gem, quality, ruby, rubies, as, with, other, gemstones, are, graded, using, criteria, known, as, the, four, cs, namely, color, cut, clarity, and, carat, weight, rubies, are, also, evaluated, on, the, basis, of, their, geographic, origin, in, the, evaluation, of, colored, gemstones, color, is, the, most, important, factor, color, divides, into, three, components, hue, saturation, and, tone, hue, refers, to, color, as, we, normally, use, the, term, transparent, gemstones, occur, in, the, pure, spectral, hues, of, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, in, nature, there, are, rarely, pure, hues, so, when, speaking, of, the, hue, of, a, gemstone, we, speak, of, primary, and, secondary, and, sometimes, tertiary, hues, ruby, is, defined, to, be, red, all, other, hues, of, the, gem, species, corundum, are, called, sapphire, ruby, may, exhibit, a, range, of, secondary, hues, including, orange, purple, violet, and, pink, because, rubies, host, many, inclusions, their, clarity, is, evaluated, by, the, inclusions, size, number, location, and, visibility, rubies, with, the, highest, clarity, grades, are, known, as, eye, clean, because, their, inclusions, are, the, least, visible, to, the, naked, human, eye, rubies, may, also, have, thin, intersecting, inclusions, called, silk, silk, can, scatter, light, brightening, the, gem, s, appearance, and, the, presence, of, silk, can, also, show, whether, a, ruby, has, been, previously, heat, treated, since, intense, heat, will, degrade, a, ruby, s, silk, improving, the, quality, of, gemstones, by, treating, them, is, common, practice, some, treatments, are, used, in, almost, all, cases, and, are, therefore, considered, acceptable, during, the, late, 1990s, a, large, supply, of, low, cost, materials, caused, a, sudden, surge, in, supply, of, heat, treated, rubies, leading, to, a, downward, pressure, on, ruby, prices, improvements, used, include, color, alteration, improving, transparency, by, dissolving, rutile, inclusions, healing, of, fractures, cracks, or, even, completely, filling, them, the, most, common, treatment, is, the, application, of, heat, most, rubies, at, the, lower, end, of, the, market, are, heat, treated, to, improve, color, remove, purple, tinge, blue, patches, and, silk, these, heat, treatments, typically, occur, around, temperatures, of, 1800, c, 3300, f, some, rubies, undergo, a, process, of, low, tube, heat, when, the, stone, is, heated, over, charcoal, of, a, temperature, of, about, 1300, c, 2400, f, for, 20, to, 30, minutes, the, silk, is, partially, broken, and, the, color, is, improved, another, treatment, which, has, become, more, frequent, in, recent, years, is, lead, glass, filling, filling, the, fractures, inside, the, ruby, with, lead, glass, or, a, similar, material, dramatically, improves, the, transparency, of, the, stone, making, previously, unsuitable, rubies, fit, for, applications, in, jewelry, the, process, is, done, in, four, steps, if, a, color, needs, to, be, added, the, glass, powder, can, be, enhanced, with, copper, or, other, metal, oxides, as, well, as, elements, such, as, sodium, calcium, potassium, etc, the, second, heating, process, can, be, repeated, three, to, four, times, even, applying, different, mixtures, when, jewelry, containing, rubies, is, heated, for, repairs, it, should, not, be, coated, with, boracic, acid, or, any, other, substance, as, this, can, etch, the, surface, it, does, not, have, to, be, protected, like, a, diamond, the, treatment, can, be, identified, by, noting, bubbles, in, cavities, and, fractures, using, a, 10, loupe, in, 1837, gaudin, made, the, first, synthetic, rubies, by, fusing, potash, alum, at, a, high, temperature, with, a, little, chromium, as, a, pigment, in, 1847, ebelmen, made, white, sapphire, by, fusing, alumina, in, boric, acid, in, 1877, edmond, fr, my, and, industrial, glass, maker, charles, feil, made, crystal, corundum, from, which, small, stones, could, be, cut, in, 1887, fremy, and, auguste, verneuil, manufactured, artificial, ruby, by, fusing, baf, 2, and, al, 2, o, 3, with, a, little, chromium, at, red, heat, in, 1903, verneuil, announced, he, could, produce, synthetic, rubies, on, a, commercial, scale, using, this, flame, fusion, process, later, also, known, as, the, verneuil, process, by, 1910, verneuil, s, laboratory, had, expanded, into, a, 30, furnace, production, facility, with, annual, gemstone, production, having, reached, 1, 000, kilograms, 2, 000, lb, in, 1907, other, processes, in, which, synthetic, rubies, can, be, produced, are, through, czochralski, s, pulling, process, flux, process, and, the, hydrothermal, process, most, synthetic, rubies, originate, from, flame, fusion, due, to, the, low, costs, involved, synthetic, rubies, may, have, no, imperfections, visible, to, the, naked, eye, but, magnification, may, reveal, curved, striae, and, gas, bubbles, the, fewer, the, number, and, the, less, obvious, the, imperfections, the, more, valuable, the, ruby, is, unless, there, are, no, imperfections, i, e, a, perfect, ruby, in, which, case, it, will, be, suspected, of, being, artificial, dopants, are, added, to, some, manufactured, rubies, so, they, can, be, identified, as, synthetic, but, most, need, gemological, testing, to, determine, their, origin, synthetic, rubies, have, technological, uses, as, well, as, gemological, ones, rods, of, synthetic, ruby, are, used, to, make, ruby, lasers, and, masers, the, first, working, laser, was, made, by, theodore, h, maiman, in, 1960, maiman, used, a, solid, state, light, pumped, synthetic, ruby, to, produce, red, laser, light, at, a, wavelength, of, 694, nanometers, nm, ruby, lasers, are, still, in, use, rubies, are, also, used, in, applications, where, high, hardness, is, required, such, as, at, wear, exposed, locations, in, mechanical, clockworks, or, as, scanning, probe, tips, in, a, coordinate, measuring, machine, imitation, rubies, are, also, marketed, red, spinels, red, garnets, and, colored, glass, have, been, falsely, claimed, to, be, rubies, imitations, go, back, to, roman, times, and, already, in, the, 17th, century, techniques, were, developed, to, color, foil, red, by, burning, scarlet, wool, in, the, bottom, part, of, the, furnace, which, was, then, placed, under, the, imitation, stone, trade, terms, such, as, balas, ruby, for, red, spinel, and, rubellite, for, red, tourmaline, can, mislead, unsuspecting, buyers, such, terms, are, therefore, discouraged, from, use, by, many, gemological, associations, such, as, the, laboratory, manual, harmonisation, committee, lmhc, the, concept, of, electromagnetic, radiation, amplification, through, the, mechanism, of, stimulated, emission, had, already, been, successfully, demonstrated, in, the, laboratory, by, way, of, the, maser, using, other, materials, such, as, ammonia, and, later, ruby, but, the, ruby, laser, was, the, first, device, to, work, at, optical, 694, 3, nm, wavelengths, maiman, s, prototype, laser, is, still, in, working, order
