jupiter, is, the, fifth, planet, from, the, sun, and, the, largest, in, the, solar, system, it, is, a, gas, giant, with, a, mass, more, than, 2, 5, times, that, of, all, the, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, combined, and, slightly, less, than, one, thousandth, the, mass, of, the, sun, its, diameter, is, eleven, times, that, of, earth, and, a, tenth, that, of, the, sun, jupiter, orbits, the, sun, at, a, distance, of, 5, 20, au, 778, 5, gm, with, an, orbital, period, of, 11, 86, years, it, is, the, third, brightest, natural, object, in, the, earth, s, night, sky, after, the, moon, and, venus, and, has, been, observed, since, prehistoric, times, its, name, derives, from, that, of, jupiter, the, chief, deity, of, ancient, roman, religion, jupiter, was, the, first, of, the, sun, s, planets, to, form, and, its, inward, migration, during, the, primordial, phase, of, the, solar, system, affected, much, of, the, formation, history, of, the, other, planets, hydrogen, constitutes, 90, of, jupiter, s, volume, followed, by, helium, which, forms, 25, of, its, mass, and, 10, of, its, volume, the, ongoing, contraction, of, jupiter, s, interior, generates, more, heat, than, the, planet, receives, from, the, sun, its, internal, structure, is, believed, to, consist, of, an, outer, mantle, of, fluid, metallic, hydrogen, and, a, diffuse, inner, core, of, denser, material, because, of, its, rapid, rate, of, rotation, one, turn, in, ten, hours, jupiter, is, an, oblate, spheroid, it, has, a, slight, but, noticeable, bulge, around, the, equator, the, outer, atmosphere, is, divided, into, a, series, of, latitudinal, bands, with, turbulence, and, storms, along, their, interacting, boundaries, the, most, obvious, result, of, this, is, the, great, red, spot, a, giant, storm, that, has, been, recorded, since, at, least, 1831, jupiter, is, surrounded, by, a, faint, system, of, planetary, rings, and, has, a, powerful, magnetosphere, the, second, largest, contiguous, structure, in, the, solar, system, after, the, heliosphere, jupiter, forms, a, system, of, 95, known, moons, and, probably, many, more, including, the, four, large, moons, discovered, by, galileo, galilei, in, 1610, io, europa, ganymede, and, callisto, ganymede, the, largest, of, the, four, is, larger, than, the, planet, mercury, callisto, is, the, second, largest, io, and, europa, are, each, about, the, size, of, earth, s, moon, since, 1973, jupiter, has, been, visited, by, nine, robotic, probes, seven, flybys, and, two, dedicated, orbiters, with, one, more, en, route, and, one, awaiting, launch, in, both, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, civilizations, jupiter, was, named, after, the, chief, god, of, the, divine, pantheon, zeus, to, the, greeks, and, jupiter, to, the, romans, the, international, astronomical, union, formally, adopted, the, name, jupiter, for, the, planet, in, 1976, and, has, since, named, its, newly, discovered, satellites, for, the, god, s, lovers, favourites, and, descendants, the, planetary, symbol, for, jupiter, descends, from, a, greek, zeta, with, a, horizontal, stroke, as, an, abbreviation, for, zeus, in, latin, iovis, is, the, genitive, case, of, iuppiter, i, e, jupiter, it, is, associated, with, the, etymology, of, zeus, sky, father, the, english, equivalent, jove, is, only, known, to, have, come, into, use, as, a, poetic, name, for, the, planet, around, the, 14th, century, jovian, is, the, adjectival, form, of, jupiter, the, older, adjectival, form, jovial, employed, by, astrologers, in, the, middle, ages, has, come, to, mean, happy, or, merry, moods, ascribed, to, jupiter, s, influence, in, astrology, the, original, greek, deity, zeus, supplies, the, root, zeno, which, is, used, to, form, some, jupiter, related, words, such, as, zenographic, jupiter, is, believed, to, be, the, oldest, planet, in, the, solar, system, having, formed, just, one, million, years, after, the, sun, and, roughly, 50, million, years, before, earth, current, models, of, solar, system, formation, suggest, that, jupiter, formed, at, or, beyond, the, snow, line, a, distance, from, the, early, sun, where, the, temperature, was, sufficiently, cold, for, volatiles, such, as, water, to, condense, into, solids, the, planet, began, as, a, solid, core, which, then, accumulated, its, gaseous, atmosphere, as, a, consequence, the, planet, must, have, formed, before, the, solar, nebula, was, fully, dispersed, during, its, formation, jupiter, s, mass, gradually, increased, until, it, had, 20, times, the, mass, of, the, earth, approximately, half, of, which, was, made, up, of, silicates, ices, and, other, heavy, element, constituents, when, the, proto, jupiter, grew, larger, than, 50, earth, masses, it, created, a, gap, in, the, solar, nebula, thereafter, the, growing, planet, reached, its, final, mass, in, 3, 4, million, years, since, jupiter, is, made, of, the, same, elements, as, the, sun, hydrogen, and, helium, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, solar, system, might, have, been, early, in, its, formation, a, system, of, multiple, protostars, which, are, quite, common, with, jupiter, being, the, second, but, failed, protostar, but, the, solar, system, never, developed, into, a, system, of, multiple, stars, and, jupiter, today, does, not, qualify, as, a, protostar, or, brown, dwarf, since, it, does, not, have, enough, mass, to, fuse, hydrogen, according, to, the, grand, tack, hypothesis, jupiter, began, to, form, at, a, distance, of, roughly, 3, 5, au, 520, million, km, 330, million, mi, from, the, sun, as, the, young, planet, accreted, mass, interaction, with, the, gas, disk, orbiting, the, sun, and, orbital, resonances, with, saturn, caused, it, to, migrate, inward, this, upset, the, orbits, of, several, super, earths, orbiting, closer, to, the, sun, causing, them, to, collide, destructively, saturn, would, later, have, begun, to, migrate, inwards, at, a, faster, rate, than, jupiter, until, the, two, planets, became, captured, in, a, 3, 2, mean, motion, resonance, at, approximately, 1, 5, au, 220, million, km, 140, million, mi, from, the, sun, this, changed, the, direction, of, migration, causing, them, to, migrate, away, from, the, sun, and, out, of, the, inner, system, to, their, current, locations, all, of, this, happened, over, a, period, of, 3, 6, million, years, with, the, final, migration, of, jupiter, occurring, over, several, hundred, thousand, years, jupiter, s, migration, from, the, inner, solar, system, eventually, allowed, the, inner, planets, including, earth, to, form, from, the, rubble, there, are, several, unresolved, issues, with, the, grand, tack, hypothesis, the, resulting, formation, timescales, of, terrestrial, planets, appear, to, be, inconsistent, with, the, measured, elemental, composition, it, is, likely, that, jupiter, would, have, settled, into, an, orbit, much, closer, to, the, sun, if, it, had, migrated, through, the, solar, nebula, some, competing, models, of, solar, system, formation, predict, the, formation, of, jupiter, with, orbital, properties, that, are, close, to, those, of, the, present, day, planet, other, models, predict, jupiter, forming, at, distances, much, farther, out, such, as, 18, au, 2, 7, billion, km, 1, 7, billion, mi, according, to, the, nice, model, infall, of, proto, kuiper, belt, objects, over, the, first, 600, million, years, of, solar, system, history, caused, jupiter, and, saturn, to, migrate, from, their, initial, positions, into, a, 1, 2, resonance, which, caused, saturn, to, shift, into, a, higher, orbit, disrupting, the, orbits, of, uranus, and, neptune, depleting, the, kuiper, belt, and, triggering, the, late, heavy, bombardment, based, on, jupiter, s, composition, researchers, have, made, the, case, for, an, initial, formation, outside, the, molecular, nitrogen, n, 2, snow, line, which, is, estimated, at, 20, 30, au, 3, 0, 4, 5, billion, km, 1, 9, 2, 8, billion, mi, from, the, sun, and, possibly, even, outside, the, argon, snow, line, which, may, be, as, far, as, 40, au, 6, 0, billion, km, 3, 7, billion, mi, having, formed, at, one, of, these, extreme, distances, jupiter, would, then, have, over, a, roughly, 700, 000, year, period, migrated, inwards, to, its, current, location, during, an, epoch, approximately, 2, 3, million, years, after, the, planet, began, to, form, in, this, model, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, would, have, formed, even, further, out, than, jupiter, and, saturn, would, also, have, migrated, inwards, jupiter, is, a, gas, giant, meaning, its, chemical, composition, is, primarily, hydrogen, and, helium, these, materials, are, classified, as, gasses, in, planetary, geology, a, term, that, does, not, denote, the, state, of, matter, it, is, the, largest, planet, in, the, solar, system, with, a, diameter, of, 142, 984, km, 88, 846, mi, at, its, equator, giving, it, a, volume, 1, 321, times, that, of, the, earth, its, average, density, 1, 326, g, cm, 3, is, lower, than, those, of, the, four, terrestrial, planets, the, atmosphere, of, jupiter, is, approximately, 76, hydrogen, and, 24, helium, by, mass, by, volume, the, upper, atmosphere, is, about, 90, hydrogen, and, 10, helium, with, the, lower, proportion, owing, to, the, individual, helium, atoms, being, more, massive, than, the, molecules, of, hydrogen, formed, in, this, part, of, the, atmosphere, the, atmosphere, contains, trace, amounts, of, elemental, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and, neon, as, well, as, ammonia, water, vapour, phosphine, hydrogen, sulfide, and, hydrocarbons, like, methane, ethane, and, benzene, its, outermost, layer, contains, crystals, of, frozen, ammonia, the, planet, s, interior, is, denser, with, a, composition, of, roughly, 71, hydrogen, 24, helium, and, 5, other, elements, by, mass, the, atmospheric, proportions, of, hydrogen, and, helium, are, close, to, the, theoretical, composition, of, the, primordial, solar, nebula, neon, in, the, upper, atmosphere, only, consists, of, 20, parts, per, million, by, mass, which, is, about, a, tenth, as, abundant, as, in, the, sun, jupiter, s, helium, abundance, is, about, 80, that, of, the, sun, due, to, precipitation, of, these, elements, as, helium, rich, droplets, a, process, that, happens, deep, in, the, planet, s, interior, based, on, spectroscopy, saturn, is, thought, to, be, similar, in, composition, to, jupiter, but, the, other, giant, planets, uranus, and, neptune, have, relatively, less, hydrogen, and, helium, and, relatively, more, of, the, next, most, common, elements, including, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and, sulfur, these, planets, are, known, as, ice, giants, because, during, their, formation, these, elements, are, thought, to, have, been, incorporated, into, them, as, ices, however, they, probably, contain, little, ice, today, jupiter, is, about, ten, times, larger, than, earth, 11, 209, r, and, smaller, than, the, sun, 0, 102, 76, r, jupiter, s, mass, is, 318, times, that, of, earth, 2, 5, times, that, of, all, the, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, combined, it, is, so, massive, that, its, barycentre, with, the, sun, lies, above, the, sun, s, surface, at, 1, 068, solar, radii, from, the, sun, s, centre, 6, jupiter, s, radius, is, about, one, tenth, the, radius, of, the, sun, and, its, mass, is, one, thousandth, the, mass, of, the, sun, as, the, densities, of, the, two, bodies, are, similar, a, jupiter, mass, m, j, or, m, jup, is, often, used, as, a, unit, to, describe, masses, of, other, objects, particularly, extrasolar, planets, and, brown, dwarfs, for, example, the, extrasolar, planet, hd, 209458, b, has, a, mass, of, 0, 69, m, j, while, the, brown, dwarf, gliese, 229, b, has, a, mass, of, 60, 4, m, j, theoretical, models, indicate, that, if, jupiter, had, over, 40, more, mass, the, interior, would, be, so, compressed, that, its, volume, would, decrease, despite, the, increasing, amount, of, matter, for, smaller, changes, in, its, mass, the, radius, would, not, change, appreciably, as, a, result, jupiter, is, thought, to, have, about, as, large, a, diameter, as, a, planet, of, its, composition, and, evolutionary, history, can, achieve, the, process, of, further, shrinkage, with, increasing, mass, would, continue, until, appreciable, stellar, ignition, was, achieved, although, jupiter, would, need, to, be, about, 75, times, more, massive, to, fuse, hydrogen, and, become, a, star, its, diameter, is, sufficient, as, the, smallest, red, dwarf, may, be, only, slightly, larger, in, radius, than, saturn, jupiter, radiates, more, heat, than, it, receives, through, solar, radiation, due, to, the, kelvin, helmholtz, mechanism, within, its, contracting, interior, 30, this, process, causes, jupiter, to, shrink, by, about, 1, mm, 0, 039, in, per, year, at, the, time, of, its, formation, jupiter, was, hotter, and, was, about, twice, its, current, diameter, before, the, early, 21st, century, most, scientists, proposed, one, of, two, scenarios, for, the, formation, of, jupiter, if, the, planet, accreted, first, as, a, solid, body, it, would, consist, of, a, dense, core, a, surrounding, layer, of, fluid, metallic, hydrogen, with, some, helium, extending, outward, to, about, 80, of, the, radius, of, the, planet, and, an, outer, atmosphere, consisting, primarily, of, molecular, hydrogen, alternatively, if, the, planet, collapsed, directly, from, the, gaseous, protoplanetary, disk, it, was, expected, to, completely, lack, a, core, consisting, instead, of, a, denser, and, denser, fluid, predominantly, molecular, and, metallic, hydrogen, all, the, way, to, the, centre, data, from, the, juno, mission, showed, that, jupiter, has, a, diffuse, core, that, mixes, into, its, mantle, extending, for, 30, 50, of, the, planet, s, radius, and, comprising, heavy, elements, with, a, combined, mass, 7, 25, times, the, earth, this, mixing, process, could, have, arisen, during, formation, while, the, planet, accreted, solids, and, gases, from, the, surrounding, nebula, alternatively, it, could, have, been, caused, by, an, impact, from, a, planet, of, about, ten, earth, masses, a, few, million, years, after, jupiter, s, formation, which, would, have, disrupted, an, originally, compact, jovian, core, outside, the, layer, of, metallic, hydrogen, lies, a, transparent, interior, atmosphere, of, hydrogen, at, this, depth, the, pressure, and, temperature, are, above, molecular, hydrogen, s, critical, pressure, of, 1, 3, mpa, and, critical, temperature, of, 33, k, 240, 2, c, 400, 3, f, in, this, state, there, are, no, distinct, liquid, and, gas, phases, hydrogen, is, said, to, be, in, a, supercritical, fluid, state, the, hydrogen, and, helium, gas, extending, downward, from, the, cloud, layer, gradually, transitions, to, a, liquid, in, deeper, layers, possibly, resembling, something, akin, to, an, ocean, of, liquid, hydrogen, and, other, supercritical, fluids, 22, physically, the, gas, gradually, becomes, hotter, and, denser, as, depth, increases, rain, like, droplets, of, helium, and, neon, precipitate, downward, through, the, lower, atmosphere, depleting, the, abundance, of, these, elements, in, the, upper, atmosphere, calculations, suggest, that, helium, drops, separate, from, metallic, hydrogen, at, a, radius, of, 60, 000, km, 37, 000, mi, 11, 000, km, 6, 800, mi, below, the, cloud, tops, and, merge, again, at, 50, 000, km, 31, 000, mi, 22, 000, km, 14, 000, mi, beneath, the, clouds, rainfalls, of, diamonds, have, been, suggested, to, occur, as, well, as, on, saturn, and, the, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, the, temperature, and, pressure, inside, jupiter, increase, steadily, inward, as, the, heat, of, planetary, formation, can, only, escape, by, convection, at, a, surface, depth, where, the, atmospheric, pressure, level, is, 1, bar, 0, 10, mpa, the, temperature, is, around, 165, k, 108, c, 163, f, the, region, where, supercritical, hydrogen, changes, gradually, from, a, molecular, fluid, to, a, metallic, fluid, spans, pressure, ranges, of, 50, 400, gpa, with, temperatures, of, 5, 000, 8, 400, k, 4, 730, 8, 130, c, 8, 540, 14, 660, f, respectively, the, temperature, of, jupiter, s, diluted, core, is, estimated, to, be, 20, 000, k, 19, 700, c, 35, 500, f, with, a, pressure, of, around, 4, 000, gpa, the, atmosphere, of, jupiter, is, primarily, composed, of, molecular, hydrogen, and, helium, with, a, smaller, amount, of, other, compounds, such, as, water, methane, hydrogen, sulfide, and, ammonia, jupiter, s, atmosphere, extends, to, a, depth, of, approximately, 3, 000, km, 2, 000, mi, below, the, cloud, layers, jupiter, is, perpetually, covered, with, clouds, of, ammonia, crystals, which, may, contain, ammonium, hydrosulfide, as, well, the, clouds, are, located, in, the, tropopause, layer, of, the, atmosphere, forming, bands, at, different, latitudes, known, as, tropical, regions, these, are, subdivided, into, lighter, hued, zones, and, darker, belts, the, interactions, of, these, conflicting, circulation, patterns, cause, storms, and, turbulence, wind, speeds, of, 100, metres, per, second, 360, km, h, 220, mph, are, common, in, zonal, jet, streams, the, zones, have, been, observed, to, vary, in, width, colour, and, intensity, from, year, to, year, but, they, have, remained, stable, enough, for, scientists, to, name, them, 6, the, cloud, layer, is, about, 50, km, 31, mi, deep, and, consists, of, at, least, two, decks, of, ammonia, clouds, a, thin, clearer, region, on, top, and, a, thicker, lower, deck, there, may, be, a, thin, layer, of, water, clouds, underlying, the, ammonia, clouds, as, suggested, by, flashes, of, lightning, detected, in, the, atmosphere, of, jupiter, these, electrical, discharges, can, be, up, to, a, thousand, times, as, powerful, as, lightning, on, earth, the, water, clouds, are, assumed, to, generate, thunderstorms, in, the, same, way, as, terrestrial, thunderstorms, driven, by, the, heat, rising, from, the, interior, the, juno, mission, revealed, the, presence, of, shallow, lightning, which, originates, from, ammonia, water, clouds, relatively, high, in, the, atmosphere, these, discharges, carry, mushballs, of, water, ammonia, slushes, covered, in, ice, which, fall, deep, into, the, atmosphere, upper, atmospheric, lightning, has, been, observed, in, jupiter, s, upper, atmosphere, bright, flashes, of, light, that, last, around, 1, 4, milliseconds, these, are, known, as, elves, or, sprites, and, appear, blue, or, pink, due, to, the, hydrogen, the, orange, and, brown, colours, in, the, clouds, of, jupiter, are, caused, by, upwelling, compounds, that, change, colour, when, they, are, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, from, the, sun, the, exact, makeup, remains, uncertain, but, the, substances, are, thought, to, be, made, up, of, phosphorus, sulfur, or, possibly, hydrocarbons, 39, these, colourful, compounds, known, as, chromophores, mix, with, the, warmer, clouds, of, the, lower, deck, the, light, coloured, zones, are, formed, when, rising, convection, cells, form, crystallising, ammonia, that, hides, the, chromophores, from, view, jupiter, has, a, low, axial, tilt, thus, ensuring, that, the, poles, always, receive, less, solar, radiation, than, the, planet, s, equatorial, region, convection, within, the, interior, of, the, planet, transports, energy, to, the, poles, balancing, out, temperatures, at, the, cloud, layer, 54, a, well, known, feature, of, jupiter, is, the, great, red, spot, a, persistent, anticyclonic, storm, located, 22, south, of, the, equator, it, was, first, observed, in, 1831, and, possibly, as, early, as, 1665, images, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, have, shown, two, more, red, spots, adjacent, to, the, great, red, spot, the, storm, is, visible, through, earth, based, telescopes, with, an, aperture, of, 12, cm, or, larger, the, oval, object, rotates, counterclockwise, with, a, period, of, about, six, days, the, maximum, altitude, of, this, storm, is, about, 8, km, 5, mi, above, the, surrounding, cloud, tops, the, spot, s, composition, and, the, source, of, its, red, colour, remain, uncertain, although, photodissociated, ammonia, reacting, with, acetylene, is, a, likely, explanation, the, great, red, spot, is, larger, than, the, earth, mathematical, models, suggest, that, the, storm, is, stable, and, will, be, a, permanent, feature, of, the, planet, however, it, has, significantly, decreased, in, size, since, its, discovery, initial, observations, in, the, late, 1800s, showed, it, to, be, approximately, 41, 000, km, 25, 500, mi, across, by, the, time, of, the, voyager, flybys, in, 1979, the, storm, had, a, length, of, 23, 300, km, 14, 500, mi, and, a, width, of, approximately, 13, 000, km, 8, 000, mi, hubble, observations, in, 1995, showed, it, had, decreased, in, size, to, 20, 950, km, 13, 020, mi, and, observations, in, 2009, showed, the, size, to, be, 17, 910, km, 11, 130, mi, as, of, 2015, the, storm, was, measured, at, approximately, 16, 500, by, 10, 940, km, 10, 250, by, 6, 800, mi, and, was, decreasing, in, length, by, about, 930, km, 580, mi, per, year, in, october, 2021, a, juno, flyby, mission, measured, the, depth, of, the, great, red, spot, putting, it, at, around, 300, 500, kilometres, 190, 310, mi, juno, missions, show, that, there, are, several, polar, cyclone, groups, at, jupiter, s, poles, the, northern, group, contains, nine, cyclones, with, a, large, one, in, the, centre, and, eight, others, around, it, while, its, southern, counterpart, also, consists, of, a, centre, vortex, but, is, surrounded, by, five, large, storms, and, a, single, smaller, one, for, a, total, of, 7, storms, in, 2000, an, atmospheric, feature, formed, in, the, southern, hemisphere, that, is, similar, in, appearance, to, the, great, red, spot, but, smaller, this, was, created, when, smaller, white, oval, shaped, storms, merged, to, form, a, single, feature, these, three, smaller, white, ovals, were, formed, in, 1939, 1940, the, merged, feature, was, named, oval, ba, it, has, since, increased, in, intensity, and, changed, from, white, to, red, earning, it, the, nickname, little, red, spot, in, april, 2017, a, great, cold, spot, was, discovered, in, jupiter, s, thermosphere, at, its, north, pole, this, feature, is, 24, 000, km, 15, 000, mi, across, 12, 000, km, 7, 500, mi, wide, and, 200, c, 360, f, cooler, than, surrounding, material, while, this, spot, changes, form, and, intensity, over, the, short, term, it, has, maintained, its, general, position, in, the, atmosphere, for, more, than, 15, years, it, may, be, a, giant, vortex, similar, to, the, great, red, spot, and, appears, to, be, quasi, stable, like, the, vortices, in, earth, s, thermosphere, this, feature, may, be, formed, by, interactions, between, charged, particles, generated, from, io, and, the, strong, magnetic, field, of, jupiter, resulting, in, a, redistribution, of, heat, flow, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, is, the, strongest, of, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, with, a, dipole, moment, of, 4, 170, gauss, 0, 4170, mt, that, is, tilted, at, an, angle, of, 10, 31, to, the, pole, of, rotation, the, surface, magnetic, field, strength, varies, from, 2, gauss, 0, 20, mt, up, to, 20, gauss, 2, 0, mt, this, field, is, thought, to, be, generated, by, eddy, currents, swirling, movements, of, conducting, materials, within, the, fluid, metallic, hydrogen, core, at, about, 75, jupiter, radii, from, the, planet, the, interaction, of, the, magnetosphere, with, the, solar, wind, generates, a, bow, shock, surrounding, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, is, a, magnetopause, located, at, the, inner, edge, of, a, magnetosheath, a, region, between, it, and, the, bow, shock, the, solar, wind, interacts, with, these, regions, elongating, the, magnetosphere, on, jupiter, s, lee, side, and, extending, it, outward, until, it, nearly, reaches, the, orbit, of, saturn, the, four, largest, moons, of, jupiter, all, orbit, within, the, magnetosphere, which, protects, them, from, solar, wind, 69, the, volcanoes, on, the, moon, io, emit, large, amounts, of, sulfur, dioxide, forming, a, gas, torus, along, its, orbit, the, gas, is, ionized, in, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, producing, sulfur, and, oxygen, ions, they, together, with, hydrogen, ions, originating, from, the, atmosphere, of, jupiter, form, a, plasma, sheet, in, jupiter, s, equatorial, plane, the, plasma, in, the, sheet, co, rotates, with, the, planet, causing, deformation, of, the, dipole, magnetic, field, into, that, of, a, magnetodisk, electrons, within, the, plasma, sheet, generate, a, strong, radio, signature, with, short, superimposed, bursts, in, the, range, of, 0, 6, 30, mhz, that, are, detectable, from, earth, with, consumer, grade, shortwave, radio, receivers, as, io, moves, through, this, torus, the, interaction, generates, alfv, n, waves, that, carry, ionized, matter, into, the, polar, regions, of, jupiter, as, a, result, radio, waves, are, generated, through, a, cyclotron, maser, mechanism, and, the, energy, is, transmitted, out, along, a, cone, shaped, surface, when, earth, intersects, this, cone, the, radio, emissions, from, jupiter, can, exceed, the, radio, output, of, the, sun, jupiter, has, a, faint, planetary, ring, system, composed, of, three, main, segments, an, inner, torus, of, particles, known, as, the, halo, a, relatively, bright, main, ring, and, an, outer, gossamer, ring, these, rings, appear, to, be, made, of, dust, whereas, saturn, s, rings, are, made, of, ice, 65, the, main, ring, is, most, likely, made, out, of, material, ejected, from, the, satellites, adrastea, and, metis, which, is, drawn, into, jupiter, because, of, the, planet, s, strong, gravitational, influence, new, material, is, added, by, additional, impacts, in, a, similar, way, the, moons, thebe, and, amalthea, are, believed, to, produce, the, two, distinct, components, of, the, dusty, gossamer, ring, there, is, evidence, of, a, fourth, ring, that, may, consist, of, collisional, debris, from, amalthea, that, is, strung, along, the, same, moon, s, orbit, jupiter, is, the, only, planet, whose, barycentre, with, the, sun, lies, outside, the, volume, of, the, sun, though, by, only, 7, of, the, sun, s, radius, the, average, distance, between, jupiter, and, the, sun, is, 778, million, km, 5, 2, au, and, it, completes, an, orbit, every, 11, 86, years, this, is, approximately, two, fifths, the, orbital, period, of, saturn, forming, a, near, orbital, resonance, the, orbital, plane, of, jupiter, is, inclined, 1, 30, compared, to, earth, because, the, eccentricity, of, its, orbit, is, 0, 049, jupiter, is, slightly, over, 75, million, km, nearer, the, sun, at, perihelion, than, aphelion, which, means, that, its, orbit, is, nearly, circular, this, low, eccentricity, is, at, odds, with, exoplanet, discoveries, which, have, revealed, jupiter, sized, planets, with, very, high, eccentricities, models, suggest, this, may, be, due, to, there, being, only, two, giant, planets, in, our, solar, system, as, the, presence, of, a, third, or, more, giant, planets, tends, to, induce, larger, eccentricities, the, axial, tilt, of, jupiter, is, relatively, small, only, 3, 13, so, its, seasons, are, insignificant, compared, to, those, of, earth, and, mars, jupiter, s, rotation, is, the, fastest, of, all, the, solar, system, s, planets, completing, a, rotation, on, its, axis, in, slightly, less, than, ten, hours, this, creates, an, equatorial, bulge, easily, seen, through, an, amateur, telescope, because, jupiter, is, not, a, solid, body, its, upper, atmosphere, undergoes, differential, rotation, the, rotation, of, jupiter, s, polar, atmosphere, is, about, 5, minutes, longer, than, that, of, the, equatorial, atmosphere, the, planet, is, an, oblate, spheroid, meaning, that, the, diameter, across, its, equator, is, longer, than, the, diameter, measured, between, its, poles, on, jupiter, the, equatorial, diameter, is, 9, 276, km, 5, 764, mi, longer, than, the, polar, diameter, three, systems, are, used, as, frames, of, reference, for, tracking, planetary, rotation, particularly, when, graphing, the, motion, of, atmospheric, features, system, i, applies, to, latitudes, from, 7, n, to, 7, s, its, period, is, the, planet, s, shortest, at, 9h, 50, m, 30, 0s, system, ii, applies, at, latitudes, north, and, south, of, these, its, period, is, 9h, 55, m, 40, 6s, system, iii, was, defined, by, radio, astronomers, and, corresponds, to, the, rotation, of, the, planet, s, magnetosphere, its, period, is, jupiter, s, official, rotation, jupiter, is, usually, the, fourth, brightest, object, in, the, sky, after, the, sun, the, moon, and, venus, although, at, opposition, mars, can, appear, brighter, than, jupiter, depending, on, jupiter, s, position, with, respect, to, the, earth, it, can, vary, in, visual, magnitude, from, as, bright, as, 2, 94, at, opposition, down, to, 1, 66, during, conjunction, with, the, sun, the, mean, apparent, magnitude, is, 2, 20, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 0, 33, the, angular, diameter, of, jupiter, likewise, varies, from, 50, 1, to, 30, 5, arc, seconds, favourable, oppositions, occur, when, jupiter, is, passing, through, the, perihelion, of, its, orbit, bringing, it, closer, to, earth, near, opposition, jupiter, will, appear, to, go, into, retrograde, motion, for, a, period, of, about, 121, days, moving, backward, through, an, angle, of, 9, 9, before, returning, to, prograde, movement, because, the, orbit, of, jupiter, is, outside, that, of, earth, the, phase, angle, of, jupiter, as, viewed, from, earth, is, always, less, than, 11, 5, thus, jupiter, always, appears, nearly, fully, illuminated, when, viewed, through, earth, based, telescopes, it, was, only, during, spacecraft, missions, to, jupiter, that, crescent, views, of, the, planet, were, obtained, a, small, telescope, will, usually, show, jupiter, s, four, galilean, moons, and, the, prominent, cloud, belts, across, jupiter, s, atmosphere, a, larger, telescope, with, an, aperture, of, 4, 6, inches, 10, 15, cm, will, show, jupiter, s, great, red, spot, when, it, faces, earth, observation, of, jupiter, dates, back, to, at, least, the, babylonian, astronomers, of, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, bc, the, ancient, chinese, knew, jupiter, as, the, su, star, su, x, ng, and, established, their, cycle, of, 12, earthly, branches, based, on, the, approximate, number, of, years, it, takes, jupiter, to, rotate, around, the, sun, the, chinese, language, still, uses, its, name, simplified, as, when, referring, to, years, of, age, by, the, 4th, century, bc, these, observations, had, developed, into, the, chinese, zodiac, and, each, year, became, associated, with, a, tai, sui, star, and, god, controlling, the, region, of, the, heavens, opposite, jupiter, s, position, in, the, night, sky, these, beliefs, survive, in, some, taoist, religious, practices, and, in, the, east, asian, zodiac, s, twelve, animals, the, chinese, historian, xi, zezong, has, claimed, that, gan, de, an, ancient, chinese, astronomer, reported, a, small, star, in, alliance, with, the, planet, which, may, indicate, a, sighting, of, one, of, jupiter, s, moons, with, the, unaided, eye, if, true, this, would, predate, galileo, s, discovery, by, nearly, two, millennia, a, 2016, paper, reports, that, trapezoidal, rule, was, used, by, babylonians, before, 50, bc, for, integrating, the, velocity, of, jupiter, along, the, ecliptic, in, his, 2nd, century, work, the, almagest, the, hellenistic, astronomer, claudius, ptolemaeus, constructed, a, geocentric, planetary, model, based, on, deferents, and, epicycles, to, explain, jupiter, s, motion, relative, to, earth, giving, its, orbital, period, around, earth, as, 4332, 38, days, or, 11, 86, years, in, 1610, italian, polymath, galileo, galilei, discovered, the, four, largest, moons, of, jupiter, now, known, as, the, galilean, moons, using, a, telescope, this, is, thought, to, be, the, first, telescopic, observation, of, moons, other, than, earth, s, just, one, day, after, galileo, simon, marius, independently, discovered, moons, around, jupiter, though, he, did, not, publish, his, discovery, in, a, book, until, 1614, it, was, marius, s, names, for, the, major, moons, however, that, stuck, io, europa, ganymede, and, callisto, the, discovery, was, a, major, point, in, favour, of, copernicus, heliocentric, theory, of, the, motions, of, the, planets, galileo, s, outspoken, support, of, the, copernican, theory, led, to, him, being, tried, and, condemned, by, the, inquisition, in, the, autumn, of, 1639, the, neapolitan, optician, francesco, fontana, tested, a, 22, palm, telescope, of, his, own, making, and, discovered, the, characteristic, bands, of, the, planet, s, atmosphere, during, the, 1660s, giovanni, cassini, used, a, new, telescope, to, discover, spots, in, jupiter, s, atmosphere, observe, that, the, planet, appeared, oblate, and, estimate, its, rotation, period, in, 1692, cassini, noticed, that, the, atmosphere, undergoes, a, differential, rotation, the, great, red, spot, may, have, been, observed, as, early, as, 1664, by, robert, hooke, and, in, 1665, by, cassini, although, this, is, disputed, the, pharmacist, heinrich, schwabe, produced, the, earliest, known, drawing, to, show, details, of, the, great, red, spot, in, 1831, the, red, spot, was, reportedly, lost, from, sight, on, several, occasions, between, 1665, and, 1708, before, becoming, quite, conspicuous, in, 1878, it, was, recorded, as, fading, again, in, 1883, and, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, both, giovanni, borelli, and, cassini, made, careful, tables, of, the, motions, of, jupiter, s, moons, which, allowed, predictions, of, when, the, moons, would, pass, before, or, behind, the, planet, by, the, 1670s, cassini, observed, that, when, jupiter, was, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, from, earth, these, events, would, occur, about, 17, minutes, later, than, expected, ole, r, mer, deduced, that, light, does, not, travel, instantaneously, a, conclusion, that, cassini, had, earlier, rejected, and, this, timing, discrepancy, was, used, to, estimate, the, speed, of, light, in, 1892, e, e, barnard, observed, a, fifth, satellite, of, jupiter, with, the, 36, inch, 910, mm, refractor, at, lick, observatory, in, california, this, moon, was, later, named, amalthea, it, was, the, last, planetary, moon, to, be, discovered, directly, by, a, visual, observer, through, a, telescope, an, additional, eight, satellites, were, discovered, before, the, flyby, of, the, voyager, 1, probe, in, 1979, in, 1932, rupert, wildt, identified, absorption, bands, of, ammonia, and, methane, in, the, spectra, of, jupiter, three, long, lived, anticyclonic, features, called, white, ovals, were, observed, in, 1938, for, several, decades, they, remained, as, separate, features, in, the, atmosphere, sometimes, approaching, each, other, but, never, merging, finally, two, of, the, ovals, merged, in, 1998, then, absorbed, the, third, in, 2000, becoming, oval, ba, in, 1955, bernard, burke, and, kenneth, franklin, discovered, that, jupiter, emits, bursts, of, radio, waves, at, a, frequency, of, 22, 2, mhz, 36, the, period, of, these, bursts, matched, the, rotation, of, the, planet, and, they, used, this, information, to, determine, a, more, precise, value, for, jupiter, s, rotation, rate, radio, bursts, from, jupiter, were, found, to, come, in, two, forms, long, bursts, or, l, bursts, lasting, up, to, several, seconds, and, short, bursts, or, s, bursts, lasting, less, than, a, hundredth, of, a, second, scientists, have, discovered, three, forms, of, radio, signals, transmitted, from, jupiter, jupiter, has, been, visited, by, automated, spacecraft, since, 1973, when, the, space, probe, pioneer, 10, passed, close, enough, to, jupiter, to, send, back, revelations, about, its, properties, and, phenomena, missions, to, jupiter, are, accomplished, at, a, cost, in, energy, which, is, described, by, the, net, change, in, velocity, of, the, spacecraft, or, delta, v, entering, a, hohmann, transfer, orbit, from, earth, to, jupiter, from, low, earth, orbit, requires, a, delta, v, of, 6, 3, km, s, which, is, comparable, to, the, 9, 7, km, s, delta, v, needed, to, reach, low, earth, orbit, gravity, assists, through, planetary, flybys, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, energy, required, to, reach, jupiter, beginning, in, 1973, several, spacecraft, performed, planetary, flyby, manoeuvres, that, brought, them, within, the, observation, range, of, jupiter, the, pioneer, missions, obtained, the, first, close, up, images, of, jupiter, s, atmosphere, and, several, of, its, moons, they, discovered, that, the, radiation, fields, near, the, planet, were, much, stronger, than, expected, but, both, spacecraft, managed, to, survive, in, that, environment, the, trajectories, of, these, spacecraft, were, used, to, refine, the, mass, estimates, of, the, jovian, system, radio, occultations, by, the, planet, resulted, in, better, measurements, of, jupiter, s, diameter, and, the, amount, of, polar, flattening, 47, six, years, later, the, voyager, missions, vastly, improved, the, understanding, of, the, galilean, moons, and, discovered, jupiter, s, rings, they, also, confirmed, that, the, great, red, spot, was, anticyclonic, comparison, of, images, showed, that, the, spot, had, changed, hues, since, the, pioneer, missions, turning, from, orange, to, dark, brown, a, torus, of, ionized, atoms, was, discovered, along, io, s, orbital, path, which, were, found, to, come, from, erupting, volcanoes, on, the, moon, s, surface, as, the, spacecraft, passed, behind, the, planet, it, observed, flashes, of, lightning, in, the, night, side, atmosphere, 87, the, next, mission, to, encounter, jupiter, was, the, ulysses, solar, probe, in, february, 1992, it, performed, a, flyby, manoeuvre, to, attain, a, polar, orbit, around, the, sun, during, this, pass, the, spacecraft, studied, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, although, it, had, no, cameras, to, photograph, the, planet, the, spacecraft, passed, by, jupiter, six, years, later, this, time, at, a, much, greater, distance, in, 2000, the, cassini, probe, flew, by, jupiter, on, its, way, to, saturn, and, provided, higher, resolution, images, the, new, horizons, probe, flew, by, jupiter, in, 2007, for, a, gravity, assist, en, route, to, pluto, the, probe, s, cameras, measured, plasma, output, from, volcanoes, on, io, and, studied, all, four, galilean, moons, in, detail, the, first, spacecraft, to, orbit, jupiter, was, the, galileo, mission, which, reached, the, planet, on, december, 7, 1995, it, remained, in, orbit, for, over, seven, years, conducting, multiple, flybys, of, all, the, galilean, moons, and, amalthea, the, spacecraft, also, witnessed, the, impact, of, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, when, it, collided, with, jupiter, in, 1994, some, of, the, goals, for, the, mission, were, thwarted, due, to, a, malfunction, in, galileo, s, high, gain, antenna, a, 340, kilogram, titanium, atmospheric, probe, was, released, from, the, spacecraft, in, july, 1995, entering, jupiter, s, atmosphere, on, december, 7, it, parachuted, through, 150, km, 93, mi, of, the, atmosphere, at, a, speed, of, about, 2, 575, km, h, 1, 600, mph, and, collected, data, for, 57, 6, minutes, until, the, spacecraft, was, destroyed, the, galileo, orbiter, itself, experienced, a, more, rapid, version, of, the, same, fate, when, it, was, deliberately, steered, into, the, planet, on, september, 21, 2003, nasa, destroyed, the, spacecraft, to, avoid, any, possibility, of, the, spacecraft, crashing, into, and, possibly, contaminating, the, moon, europa, which, may, harbour, life, data, from, this, mission, revealed, that, hydrogen, composes, up, to, 90, of, jupiter, s, atmosphere, the, recorded, temperature, was, more, than, 300, c, 570, f, and, the, wind, speed, measured, more, than, 644, km, h, 400, mph, before, the, probes, vaporized, nasa, s, juno, mission, arrived, at, jupiter, on, july, 4, 2016, with, the, goal, of, studying, the, planet, in, detail, from, a, polar, orbit, the, spacecraft, was, originally, intended, to, orbit, jupiter, thirty, seven, times, over, a, period, of, twenty, months, during, the, mission, the, spacecraft, will, be, exposed, to, high, levels, of, radiation, from, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, which, may, cause, the, failure, of, certain, instruments, on, august, 27, 2016, the, spacecraft, completed, its, first, flyby, of, jupiter, and, sent, back, the, first, ever, images, of, jupiter, s, north, pole, juno, completed, 12, orbits, before, the, end, of, its, budgeted, mission, plan, ending, in, july, 2018, in, june, of, that, year, nasa, extended, the, mission, operations, plan, to, july, 2021, and, in, january, of, that, year, the, mission, was, extended, to, september, 2025, with, four, lunar, flybys, one, of, ganymede, one, of, europa, and, two, of, io, when, juno, reaches, the, end, of, the, mission, it, will, perform, a, controlled, deorbit, and, disintegrate, into, jupiter, s, atmosphere, this, will, avoid, the, risk, of, collision, with, jupiter, s, moons, there, is, great, interest, in, missions, to, study, jupiter, s, larger, icy, moons, which, may, have, subsurface, liquid, oceans, funding, difficulties, have, delayed, progress, causing, nasa, s, jimo, jupiter, icy, moons, orbiter, to, be, cancelled, in, 2005, a, subsequent, proposal, was, developed, for, a, joint, nasa, esa, mission, called, ejsm, laplace, with, a, provisional, launch, date, around, 2020, ejsm, laplace, would, have, consisted, of, the, nasa, led, jupiter, europa, orbiter, and, the, esa, led, jupiter, ganymede, orbiter, however, the, esa, formally, ended, the, partnership, in, april, 2011, citing, budget, issues, at, nasa, and, the, consequences, on, the, mission, timetable, instead, esa, planned, to, go, ahead, with, a, european, only, mission, to, compete, in, its, l1, cosmic, vision, selection, these, plans, have, been, realized, as, the, european, space, agency, s, jupiter, icy, moon, explorer, juice, launched, on, april, 14, 2023, followed, by, nasa, s, europa, clipper, mission, scheduled, for, launch, in, 2024, other, proposed, missions, include, the, chinese, national, space, administration, s, tianwen, 4, mission, which, aims, to, launch, an, orbiter, to, the, jovian, system, and, possibly, callisto, around, 2035, and, cnsa, s, interstellar, express, and, nasa, s, interstellar, probe, which, would, both, use, jupiter, s, gravity, to, help, them, reach, the, edges, of, the, heliosphere, jupiter, has, 95, known, natural, satellites, and, it, is, likely, that, this, number, would, go, up, in, the, future, due, to, improved, instrumentation, of, these, 79, are, less, than, 10, km, in, diameter, the, four, largest, moons, are, ganymede, callisto, io, and, europa, in, order, of, decreasing, size, collectively, known, as, the, galilean, moons, and, are, visible, from, earth, with, binoculars, on, a, clear, night, the, moons, discovered, by, galileo, io, europa, ganymede, and, callisto, are, among, the, largest, in, the, solar, system, the, orbits, of, io, europa, and, ganymede, form, a, pattern, known, as, a, laplace, resonance, for, every, four, orbits, that, io, makes, around, jupiter, europa, makes, exactly, two, orbits, and, ganymede, makes, exactly, one, this, resonance, causes, the, gravitational, effects, of, the, three, large, moons, to, distort, their, orbits, into, elliptical, shapes, because, each, moon, receives, an, extra, tug, from, its, neighbours, at, the, same, point, in, every, orbit, it, makes, the, tidal, force, from, jupiter, on, the, other, hand, works, to, circularize, their, orbits, the, eccentricity, of, their, orbits, causes, regular, flexing, of, the, three, moons, shapes, with, jupiter, s, gravity, stretching, them, out, as, they, approach, it, and, allowing, them, to, spring, back, to, more, spherical, shapes, as, they, swing, away, the, friction, created, by, this, tidal, flexing, generates, heat, in, the, interior, of, the, moons, this, is, seen, most, dramatically, in, the, volcanic, activity, of, io, which, is, subject, to, the, strongest, tidal, forces, and, to, a, lesser, degree, in, the, geological, youth, of, europa, s, surface, which, indicates, recent, resurfacing, of, the, moon, s, exterior, jupiter, s, moons, were, traditionally, classified, into, four, groups, of, four, based, on, their, similar, orbital, elements, this, picture, has, been, complicated, by, the, discovery, of, numerous, small, outer, moons, since, 1999, jupiter, s, moons, are, currently, divided, into, several, different, groups, although, there, are, several, moons, which, are, not, part, of, any, group, the, eight, innermost, regular, moons, which, have, nearly, circular, orbits, near, the, plane, of, jupiter, s, equator, are, thought, to, have, formed, alongside, jupiter, while, the, remainder, are, irregular, moons, and, are, thought, to, be, captured, asteroids, or, fragments, of, captured, asteroids, the, irregular, moons, within, each, group, may, have, a, common, origin, perhaps, as, a, larger, moon, or, captured, body, that, broke, up, as, the, most, massive, of, the, eight, planets, the, gravitational, influence, of, jupiter, has, helped, shape, the, solar, system, with, the, exception, of, mercury, the, orbits, of, the, system, s, planets, lie, closer, to, jupiter, s, orbital, plane, than, the, sun, s, equatorial, plane, the, kirkwood, gaps, in, the, asteroid, belt, are, mostly, caused, by, jupiter, and, the, planet, may, have, been, responsible, for, the, purported, late, heavy, bombardment, in, the, inner, solar, system, s, history, in, addition, to, its, moons, jupiter, s, gravitational, field, controls, numerous, asteroids, that, have, settled, around, the, lagrangian, points, that, precede, and, follow, the, planet, in, its, orbit, around, the, sun, these, are, known, as, the, trojan, asteroids, and, are, divided, into, greek, and, trojan, camps, to, honour, the, iliad, the, first, of, these, 588, achilles, was, discovered, by, max, wolf, in, 1906, since, then, more, than, two, thousand, have, been, discovered, the, largest, is, 624, hektor, the, jupiter, family, is, defined, as, comets, that, have, a, semi, major, axis, smaller, than, jupiter, s, most, short, period, comets, belong, to, this, group, members, of, the, jupiter, family, are, thought, to, form, in, the, kuiper, belt, outside, the, orbit, of, neptune, during, close, encounters, with, jupiter, they, are, perturbed, into, orbits, with, a, smaller, period, which, then, becomes, circularized, by, regular, gravitational, interactions, with, the, sun, and, jupiter, jupiter, has, been, called, the, solar, system, s, vacuum, cleaner, because, of, its, immense, gravity, well, and, location, near, the, inner, solar, system, there, are, more, impacts, on, jupiter, such, as, comets, than, on, any, other, planet, in, the, solar, system, for, example, jupiter, experiences, about, 200, times, more, asteroid, and, comet, impacts, than, earth, in, the, past, scientists, believed, that, jupiter, partially, shielded, the, inner, system, from, cometary, bombardment, however, computer, simulations, in, 2008, suggest, that, jupiter, does, not, cause, a, net, decrease, in, the, number, of, comets, that, pass, through, the, inner, solar, system, as, its, gravity, perturbs, their, orbits, inward, roughly, as, often, as, it, accretes, or, ejects, them, this, topic, remains, controversial, among, scientists, as, some, think, it, draws, comets, towards, earth, from, the, kuiper, belt, while, others, believe, that, jupiter, protects, earth, from, the, oort, cloud, in, july, 1994, the, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, comet, collided, with, jupiter, the, impacts, were, closely, observed, by, observatories, around, the, world, including, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, galileo, spacecraft, the, event, was, widely, covered, by, the, media, surveys, of, early, astronomical, records, and, drawings, produced, eight, examples, of, potential, impact, observations, between, 1664, and, 1839,
