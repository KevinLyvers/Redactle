carbon, monoxide, chemical, formula, co, is, a, poisonous, flammable, gas, that, is, colorless, odorless, tasteless, and, slightly, less, dense, than, air, carbon, monoxide, consists, of, one, carbon, atom, and, one, oxygen, atom, connected, by, a, triple, bond, it, is, the, simplest, carbon, oxide, in, coordination, complexes, the, carbon, monoxide, ligand, is, called, carbonyl, it, is, a, key, ingredient, in, many, processes, in, industrial, chemistry, the, most, common, source, of, carbon, monoxide, is, the, partial, combustion, of, carbon, containing, compounds, numerous, environmental, and, biological, sources, generate, carbon, monoxide, in, industry, carbon, monoxide, is, important, in, the, production, of, many, compounds, including, drugs, fragrances, and, fuels, upon, emission, into, the, atmosphere, carbon, monoxide, affects, several, processes, that, contribute, to, climate, change, indoors, co, is, one, of, the, most, acutely, toxic, contaminants, affecting, indoor, air, quality, co, may, be, emitted, from, tobacco, smoke, and, generated, from, malfunctioning, fuel, burning, stoves, wood, kerosene, natural, gas, propane, and, fuel, burning, heating, systems, wood, oil, natural, gas, and, from, blocked, flues, connected, to, these, appliances, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, is, the, most, common, type, of, fatal, air, poisoning, in, many, countries, carbon, monoxide, has, important, biological, roles, across, phylogenetic, kingdoms, it, is, produced, by, many, organisms, including, humans, in, mammalian, physiology, carbon, monoxide, is, a, classical, example, of, hormesis, where, low, concentrations, serve, as, an, endogenous, neurotransmitter, gasotransmitter, and, high, concentrations, are, toxic, resulting, in, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, it, is, isoelectronic, with, both, cyanide, anion, cn, and, molecular, nitrogen, n, 2, carbon, monoxide, is, the, simplest, oxocarbon, and, is, isoelectronic, with, other, triply, bonded, diatomic, species, possessing, 10, valence, electrons, including, the, cyanide, anion, the, nitrosonium, cation, boron, monofluoride, and, molecular, nitrogen, it, has, a, molar, mass, of, 28, 0, which, according, to, the, ideal, gas, law, makes, it, slightly, less, dense, than, air, whose, average, molar, mass, is, 28, 8, the, carbon, and, oxygen, are, connected, by, a, triple, bond, that, consists, of, a, net, two, pi, bonds, and, one, sigma, bond, the, bond, length, between, the, carbon, atom, and, the, oxygen, atom, is, 112, 8, pm, this, bond, length, is, consistent, with, a, triple, bond, as, in, molecular, nitrogen, n, 2, which, has, a, similar, bond, length, 109, 76, pm, and, nearly, the, same, molecular, mass, carbon, oxygen, double, bonds, are, significantly, longer, 120, 8, pm, in, formaldehyde, for, example, the, boiling, point, 82, k, and, melting, point, 68, k, are, very, similar, to, those, of, n, 2, 77, k, and, 63, k, respectively, the, bond, dissociation, energy, of, 1072, kj, mol, is, stronger, than, that, of, n, 2, 942, kj, mol, and, represents, the, strongest, chemical, bond, known, the, ground, electronic, state, of, carbon, monoxide, is, a, singlet, state, since, there, are, no, unpaired, electrons, the, strength, of, the, c, o, bond, in, carbon, monoxide, is, indicated, by, the, high, frequency, of, its, vibration, 2143, cm, 1, for, comparison, organic, carbonyls, such, as, ketones, and, esters, absorb, at, around, 1700, cm, 1, carbon, and, oxygen, together, have, a, total, of, 10, electrons, in, the, valence, shell, following, the, octet, rule, for, both, carbon, and, oxygen, the, two, atoms, form, a, triple, bond, with, six, shared, electrons, in, three, bonding, molecular, orbitals, rather, than, the, usual, double, bond, found, in, organic, carbonyl, compounds, since, four, of, the, shared, electrons, come, from, the, oxygen, atom, and, only, two, from, carbon, one, bonding, orbital, is, occupied, by, two, electrons, from, oxygen, forming, a, dative, or, dipolar, bond, this, causes, a, c, o, polarization, of, the, molecule, with, a, small, negative, charge, on, carbon, and, a, small, positive, charge, on, oxygen, the, other, two, bonding, orbitals, are, each, occupied, by, one, electron, from, carbon, and, one, from, oxygen, forming, polar, covalent, bonds, with, a, reverse, c, o, polarization, since, oxygen, is, more, electronegative, than, carbon, in, the, free, carbon, monoxide, molecule, a, net, negative, charge, remains, at, the, carbon, end, and, the, molecule, has, a, small, dipole, moment, of, 0, 122, d, the, molecule, is, therefore, asymmetric, oxygen, is, more, electron, dense, than, carbon, and, is, also, slightly, positively, charged, compared, to, carbon, being, negative, carbon, monoxide, has, a, computed, fractional, bond, order, of, 2, 6, indicating, that, the, third, bond, is, important, but, constitutes, somewhat, less, than, a, full, bond, thus, in, valence, bond, terms, c, o, is, the, most, important, structure, while, c, o, is, non, octet, but, has, a, neutral, formal, charge, on, each, atom, and, represents, the, second, most, important, resonance, contributor, because, of, the, lone, pair, and, divalence, of, carbon, in, this, resonance, structure, carbon, monoxide, is, often, considered, to, be, an, extraordinarily, stabilized, carbene, isocyanides, are, compounds, in, which, the, o, is, replaced, by, an, nr, r, alkyl, or, aryl, group, and, have, a, similar, bonding, scheme, if, carbon, monoxide, acts, as, a, ligand, the, polarity, of, the, dipole, may, reverse, with, a, net, negative, charge, on, the, oxygen, end, depending, on, the, structure, of, the, coordination, complex, see, also, the, section, coordination, chemistry, below, theoretical, and, experimental, studies, show, that, despite, the, greater, electronegativity, of, oxygen, the, dipole, moment, points, from, the, more, negative, carbon, end, to, the, more, positive, oxygen, end, the, three, bonds, are, in, fact, polar, covalent, bonds, that, are, strongly, polarized, the, calculated, polarization, toward, the, oxygen, atom, is, 71, for, the, bond, and, 77, for, both, bonds, the, oxidation, state, of, carbon, in, carbon, monoxide, is, 2, in, each, of, these, structures, it, is, calculated, by, counting, all, the, bonding, electrons, as, belonging, to, the, more, electronegative, oxygen, only, the, two, non, bonding, electrons, on, carbon, are, assigned, to, carbon, in, this, count, carbon, then, has, only, two, valence, electrons, in, the, molecule, compared, to, four, in, the, free, atom, carbon, monoxide, occurs, in, various, natural, and, artificial, environments, photochemical, degradation, of, plant, matter, for, example, generates, an, estimated, 60, million, tons, year, typical, concentrations, in, parts, per, million, are, as, follows, carbon, monoxide, co, is, present, in, small, amounts, about, 80, ppb, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, most, of, the, rest, comes, from, chemical, reactions, with, organic, compounds, emitted, by, human, activities, and, natural, origins, due, to, photochemical, reactions, in, the, troposphere, that, generate, about, 5, 10, 12, kilograms, per, year, other, natural, sources, of, co, include, volcanoes, forest, and, bushfires, and, other, miscellaneous, forms, of, combustion, such, as, fossil, fuels, small, amounts, are, also, emitted, from, the, ocean, and, from, geological, activity, because, carbon, monoxide, occurs, dissolved, in, molten, volcanic, rock, at, high, pressures, in, the, earth, s, mantle, because, natural, sources, of, carbon, monoxide, vary, from, year, to, year, it, is, difficult, to, accurately, measure, natural, emissions, of, the, gas, carbon, monoxide, has, an, indirect, effect, on, radiative, forcing, by, elevating, concentrations, of, direct, greenhouse, gases, including, methane, and, tropospheric, ozone, co, can, react, chemically, with, other, atmospheric, constituents, primarily, the, hydroxyl, radical, oh, that, would, otherwise, destroy, methane, through, natural, processes, in, the, atmosphere, it, is, oxidized, to, carbon, dioxide, and, ozone, carbon, monoxide, is, short, lived, in, the, atmosphere, with, an, average, lifetime, of, about, one, to, two, months, and, spatially, variable, in, concentration, due, to, its, long, lifetime, in, the, mid, troposphere, carbon, monoxide, is, also, used, as, a, tracer, for, pollutant, plumes, beyond, earth, carbon, monoxide, is, the, second, most, common, diatomic, molecule, in, the, interstellar, medium, after, molecular, hydrogen, because, of, its, asymmetry, this, polar, molecule, produces, far, brighter, spectral, lines, than, the, hydrogen, molecule, making, co, much, easier, to, detect, interstellar, co, was, first, detected, with, radio, telescopes, in, 1970, it, is, now, the, most, commonly, used, tracer, of, molecular, gas, in, general, in, the, interstellar, medium, of, galaxies, as, molecular, hydrogen, can, only, be, detected, using, ultraviolet, light, which, requires, space, telescopes, carbon, monoxide, observations, provide, much, of, the, information, about, the, molecular, clouds, in, which, most, stars, form, beta, pictoris, the, second, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, pictor, shows, an, excess, of, infrared, emission, compared, to, normal, stars, of, its, type, which, is, caused, by, large, quantities, of, dust, and, gas, including, carbon, monoxide, near, the, star, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, carbon, monoxide, occurs, as, a, result, of, the, photodissociation, of, carbon, dioxide, by, electromagnetic, radiation, of, wavelengths, shorter, than, 169, nm, it, has, also, been, identified, spectroscopically, on, the, surface, of, neptune, s, moon, triton, solid, carbon, monoxide, is, a, component, of, comets, the, volatile, or, ice, component, of, halley, s, comet, is, about, 15, co, at, room, temperature, and, at, atmospheric, pressure, carbon, monoxide, is, actually, only, metastable, see, boudouard, reaction, and, the, same, is, true, at, low, temperatures, where, co, and, co, 2, are, solid, but, nevertheless, it, can, exist, for, billions, of, years, in, comets, there, is, very, little, co, in, the, atmosphere, of, pluto, which, seems, to, have, been, formed, from, comets, this, may, be, because, there, is, or, was, liquid, water, inside, pluto, carbon, monoxide, can, react, with, water, to, form, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, this, is, called, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, when, occurring, in, the, gas, phase, but, it, can, also, take, place, very, slowly, in, an, aqueous, solution, if, the, hydrogen, partial, pressure, is, high, enough, for, instance, in, an, underground, sea, formic, acid, will, be, formed, these, reactions, can, take, place, in, a, few, million, years, even, at, temperatures, such, as, found, on, pluto, carbon, monoxide, is, a, temporary, atmospheric, pollutant, in, some, urban, areas, chiefly, from, the, exhaust, of, internal, combustion, engines, including, vehicles, portable, and, back, up, generators, lawnmowers, power, washers, etc, but, also, from, incomplete, combustion, of, various, other, fuels, including, wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural, gas, and, trash, large, co, pollution, events, can, be, observed, from, space, over, cities, carbon, monoxide, is, along, with, aldehydes, part, of, the, series, of, cycles, of, chemical, reactions, that, form, photochemical, smog, it, reacts, with, hydroxyl, radical, oh, to, produce, a, radical, intermediate, hoco, which, transfers, rapidly, its, radical, hydrogen, to, o, 2, to, form, peroxy, radical, ho, 2, and, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, peroxy, radical, subsequently, reacts, with, nitrogen, oxide, no, to, form, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, and, hydroxyl, radical, no, 2, gives, o, 3, p, via, photolysis, thereby, forming, o, 3, following, reaction, with, o, 2, since, hydroxyl, radical, is, formed, during, the, formation, of, no, 2, the, balance, of, the, sequence, of, chemical, reactions, starting, with, carbon, monoxide, and, leading, to, the, formation, of, ozone, is, where, h, refers, to, the, photon, of, light, absorbed, by, the, no, 2, molecule, in, the, sequence, although, the, creation, of, no, 2, is, the, critical, step, leading, to, low, level, ozone, formation, it, also, increases, this, ozone, in, another, somewhat, mutually, exclusive, way, by, reducing, the, quantity, of, no, that, is, available, to, react, with, ozone, carbon, monoxide, is, one, of, the, most, acutely, toxic, indoor, air, contaminants, carbon, monoxide, may, be, emitted, from, tobacco, smoke, and, generated, from, malfunctioning, fuel,

become, oxidized, to, the, brown, pigment, metmyoglobin, this, stable, red, color, can, persist, much, longer, than, in, normally, packaged, meat, typical, levels, of, carbon, monoxide, used, in, the, facilities, that, use, this, process, are, between, 0, 4, and, 0, 5, the, technology, was, first, given, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, status, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, in, 2002, for, use, as, a, secondary, packaging, system, and, does, not, require, labeling, in, 2004, the, fda, approved, co, as, primary, packaging, method, declaring, that, co, does, not, mask, spoilage, odor, the, process, is, currently, unauthorized, in, many, other, countries, including, japan, singapore, and, the, european, union, in, ancient, history, hannibal, executed, roman, prisoners, with, coal, fumes, during, the, second, punic, war, carbon, monoxide, had, been, used, for, genocide, during, the, holocaust, at, some, extermination, camps, the, most, notable, by, gas, vans, in, che, mno, and, in, the, action, t4, euthanasia, program, humans, have, maintained, a, complex, relationship, with, carbon, monoxide, since, first, learning, to, control, fire, circa, 800, 000, bc, early, humans, probably, discovered, the, toxicity, of, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, upon, introducing, fire, into, their, dwellings, the, early, development, of, metallurgy, and, smelting, technologies, emerging, circa, 6, 000, bc, through, the, bronze, age, likewise, plagued, humankind, from, carbon, monoxide, exposure, apart, from, the, toxicity, of, carbon, monoxide, indigenous, native, americans, may, have, experienced, the, neuroactive, properties, of, carbon, monoxide, through, shamanistic, fireside, rituals, early, civilizations, developed, mythological, tales, to, explain, the, origin, of, fire, such, as, prometheus, from, greek, mythology, who, shared, fire, with, humans, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, first, recorded, that, burning, coals, produced, toxic, fumes, greek, physician, galen, 129, 199, ad, speculated, that, there, was, a, change, in, the, composition, of, the, air, that, caused, harm, when, inhaled, and, many, others, of, the, era, developed, a, basis, of, knowledge, about, carbon, monoxide, in, the, context, of, coal, fume, toxicity, cleopatra, may, have, died, from, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, georg, ernst, stahl, mentioned, carbonarii, halitus, in, 1697, in, reference, to, toxic, vapors, thought, to, be, carbon, monoxide, friedrich, hoffmann, conducted, the, first, modern, scientific, investigation, into, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, from, coal, in, 1716, herman, boerhaave, conducted, the, first, scientific, experiments, on, the, effect, of, carbon, monoxide, coal, fumes, on, animals, in, the, 1730s, joseph, priestley, is, considered, to, have, first, synthesized, carbon, monoxide, in, 1772, carl, wilhelm, scheele, similarly, isolated, carbon, monoxide, from, charcoal, in, 1773, and, thought, it, could, be, the, carbonic, entity, making, fumes, toxic, torbern, bergman, isolated, carbon, monoxide, from, oxalic, acid, in, 1775, later, in, 1776, the, french, chemist, de, lassone, produced, co, by, heating, zinc, oxide, with, coke, but, mistakenly, concluded, that, the, gaseous, product, was, hydrogen, as, it, burned, with, a, blue, flame, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, including, atmospheric, concentrations, carbon, monoxide, burns, with, a, blue, flame, producing, carbon, dioxide, antoine, lavoisier, conducted, similar, inconclusive, experiments, to, lassone, in, 1777, the, gas, was, identified, as, a, compound, containing, carbon, and, oxygen, by, william, cruickshank, in, 1800, thomas, beddoes, and, james, watt, recognized, carbon, monoxide, as, hydrocarbonate, to, brighten, venous, blood, in, 1793, watt, suggested, coal, fumes, could, act, as, an, antidote, to, the, oxygen, in, blood, and, beddoes, and, watt, likewise, suggested, hydrocarbonate, has, a, greater, affinity, for, animal, fiber, than, oxygen, in, 1796, in, 1854, adrien, chenot, similarly, suggested, carbon, monoxide, to, remove, the, oxygen, from, blood, and, then, be, oxidized, by, the, body, to, carbon, dioxide, the, mechanism, for, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, is, widely, credited, to, claude, bernard, whose, memoirs, beginning, in, 1846, and, published, in, 1857, phrased, prevents, arterials, blood, from, becoming, venous, felix, hoppe, seyler, independently, published, similar, conclusions, in, the, following, year, carbon, monoxide, gained, recognition, as, an, essential, reagent, in, the, 1900s, three, industrial, processes, illustrate, its, evolution, in, industry, in, the, fischer, tropsch, process, coal, and, related, carbon, rich, feedstocks, are, converted, into, liquid, fuels, via, the, intermediacy, of, co, originally, developed, as, part, of, the, german, war, effort, to, compensate, for, their, lack, of, domestic, petroleum, this, technology, continues, today, also, in, germany, a, mixture, of, co, and, hydrogen, was, found, to, combine, with, olefins, to, give, aldehydes, this, process, called, hydroformylation, is, used, to, produce, many, large, scale, chemicals, such, as, surfactants, as, well, as, specialty, compounds, that, are, popular, fragrances, and, drugs, for, example, co, is, used, in, the, production, of, vitamin, a, in, a, third, major, process, attributed, to, researchers, at, monsanto, co, combines, with, methanol, to, give, acetic, acid, most, acetic, acid, is, produced, by, the, cativa, process, hydroformylation, and, the, acetic, acid, syntheses, are, two, of, myriad, carbonylation, processes
