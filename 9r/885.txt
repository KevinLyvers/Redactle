in, condensed, matter, physics, a, bose, einstein, condensate, bec, is, a, state, of, matter, that, is, typically, formed, when, a, gas, of, bosons, at, very, low, densities, is, cooled, to, temperatures, very, close, to, absolute, zero, i, e, 0, k, 273, 15, c, 459, 67, f, under, such, conditions, a, large, fraction, of, bosons, occupy, the, lowest, quantum, state, at, which, microscopic, quantum, mechanical, phenomena, particularly, wavefunction, interference, become, apparent, macroscopically, more, generally, condensation, refers, to, the, appearance, of, macroscopic, occupation, of, one, or, several, states, for, example, in, bcs, theory, a, superconductor, is, a, condensate, of, cooper, pairs, as, such, condensation, can, be, associated, with, phase, transition, and, the, macroscopic, occupation, of, the, state, is, the, order, parameter, bose, einstein, condensate, was, first, predicted, generally, in, 1924, 1925, by, albert, einstein, crediting, a, pioneering, paper, by, satyendra, nath, bose, on, the, new, field, now, known, as, quantum, statistics, in, 1995, the, bose, einstein, condensate, was, created, by, eric, cornell, and, carl, wieman, of, the, university, of, colorado, boulder, using, rubidium, atoms, later, that, year, wolfgang, ketterle, of, mit, produced, a, bec, using, sodium, atoms, in, 2001, cornell, wieman, and, ketterle, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, the, achievement, of, bose, einstein, condensation, in, dilute, gases, of, alkali, atoms, and, for, early, fundamental, studies, of, the, properties, of, the, condensates, bose, first, sent, a, paper, to, einstein, on, the, quantum, statistics, of, light, quanta, now, called, photons, in, which, he, derived, planck, s, quantum, radiation, law, without, any, reference, to, classical, physics, einstein, was, impressed, translated, the, paper, himself, from, english, to, german, and, submitted, it, for, bose, to, the, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, which, published, it, in, 1924, the, einstein, manuscript, once, believed, to, be, lost, was, found, in, a, library, at, leiden, university, in, 2005, einstein, then, extended, bose, s, ideas, to, matter, in, two, other, papers, the, result, of, their, efforts, is, the, concept, of, a, bose, gas, governed, by, bose, einstein, statistics, which, describes, the, statistical, distribution, of, identical, particles, with, integer, spin, now, called, bosons, bosons, particles, that, include, the, photon, and, atoms, with, an, even, number, of, neutrons, such, as, helium, 4, 4, he, are, allowed, to, share, a, quantum, state, einstein, proposed, that, cooling, bosonic, atoms, to, a, very, low, temperature, would, cause, them, to, fall, or, condense, into, the, lowest, accessible, quantum, state, resulting, in, a, new, form, of, matter, in, 1938, fritz, london, proposed, the, bec, as, a, mechanism, for, superfluidity, in, 4, he, and, superconductivity, the, quest, to, produce, a, bose, einstein, condensate, in, the, laboratory, was, stimulated, by, a, paper, published, in, 1976, by, two, program, directors, at, the, national, science, foundation, william, stwalley, and, lewis, nosanow, this, led, to, the, immediate, pursuit, of, the, idea, by, four, independent, research, groups, these, were, led, by, isaac, silvera, university, of, amsterdam, walter, hardy, university, of, british, columbia, thomas, greytak, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, and, david, lee, cornell, university, on, 5, june, 1995, the, first, gaseous, condensate, was, produced, by, eric, cornell, and, carl, wieman, at, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, nist, jila, lab, in, a, gas, of, rubidium, atoms, cooled, to, 170, nanokelvins, nk, shortly, thereafter, wolfgang, ketterle, at, mit, produced, a, bose, einstein, condensate, in, a, gas, of, sodium, atoms, for, their, achievements, cornell, wieman, and, ketterle, received, the, 2001, nobel, prize, in, physics, these, early, studies, founded, the, field, of, ultracold, atoms, and, hundreds, of, research, groups, around, the, world, now, routinely, produce, becs, of, dilute, atomic, vapors, in, their, labs, since, 1995, many, other, atomic, species, have, been, condensed, and, becs, have, also, been, realized, using, molecules, quasi, particles, and, photons, this, transition, to, bec, occurs, below, a, critical, temperature, which, for, a, uniform, three, dimensional, gas, consisting, of, non, interacting, particles, with, no, apparent, internal, degrees, of, freedom, is, given, by, where, interactions, shift, the, value, and, the, corrections, can, be, calculated, by, mean, field, theory, this, formula, is, derived, from, finding, the, gas, degeneracy, in, the, bose, gas, using, bose, einstein, statistics, for, an, ideal, bose, gas, we, have, the, equation, of, state, where, v, v, n, displaystyle, v, v, n, is, the, per, particle, volume, displaystyle, lambda, is, the, thermal, wavelength, f, displaystyle, f, is, the, fugacity, and, it, is, noticeable, that, g, 3, 2, displaystyle, g, 3, 2, is, a, monotonically, growing, function, of, f, displaystyle, f, in, f, 0, 1, displaystyle, f, in, which, are, the, only, values, for, which, the, series, converge, recognizing, that, the, second, term, on, the, right, hand, side, contains, the, expression, for, the, average, occupation, number, of, the, fundamental, state, n, 0, displaystyle, langle, n, 0, rangle, the, equation, of, state, can, be, rewritten, as, because, the, left, term, on, the, second, equation, must, always, be, positive, 3, v, g, 3, 2, f, displaystyle, frac, lambda, 3, v, g, 3, 2, f, and, because, g, 3, 2, f, g, 3, 2, 1, displaystyle, g, 3, 2, f, leq, g, 3, 2, 1, a, stronger, condition, is, which, defines, a, transition, between, a, gas, phase, and, a, condensed, phase, on, the, critical, region, it, is, possible, to, define, a, critical, temperature, and, thermal, wavelength, recovering, the, value, indicated, on, the, previous, section, the, critical, values, are, such, that, if, t, t, c, displaystyle, t, t, text, c, or, c, displaystyle, lambda, lambda, text, c, we, are, in, the, presence, of, a, bose, einstein, condensate, understanding, what, happens, with, the, fraction, of, particles, on, the, fundamental, level, is, crucial, as, so, write, the, equation, of, state, for, f, 1, displaystyle, f, 1, obtaining, so, if, t, t, c, displaystyle, t, ll, t, text, c, the, fraction, n, 0, n, 1, displaystyle, frac, langle, n, 0, rangle, n, approx, 1, and, if, t, t, c, displaystyle, t, gg, t, text, c, the, fraction, n, 0, n, 0, displaystyle, frac, langle, n, 0, rangle, n, approx, 0, at, temperatures, near, to, absolute, 0, particles, tend, to, condense, in, the, fundamental, state, which, is, the, state, with, momentum, p, 0, displaystyle, vec, p, 0, consider, a, collection, of, n, non, interacting, particles, which, can, each, be, in, one, of, two, quantum, states, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, and, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, if, the, two, states, are, equal, in, energy, each, different, configuration, is, equally, likely, if, we, can, tell, which, particle, is, which, there, are, 2, n, displaystyle, 2, n, different, configurations, since, each, particle, can, be, in, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, or, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, independently, in, almost, all, of, the, configurations, about, half, the, particles, are, in, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, and, the, other, half, in, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, the, balance, is, a, statistical, effect, the, number, of, configurations, is, largest, when, the, particles, are, divided, equally, if, the, particles, are, indistinguishable, however, there, are, only, n, 1, different, configurations, if, there, are, k, particles, in, state, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, there, are, n, k, particles, in, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, whether, any, particular, particle, is, in, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, or, in, state, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, cannot, be, determined, so, each, value, of, k, determines, a, unique, quantum, state, for, the, whole, system, suppose, now, that, the, energy, of, state, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, is, slightly, greater, than, the, energy, of, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, by, an, amount, e, at, temperature, t, a, particle, will, have, a, lesser, probability, to, be, in, state, 1, displaystyle, 1, rangle, by, e, e, k, t, displaystyle, e, e, kt, in, the, distinguishable, case, the, particle, distribution, will, be, biased, slightly, towards, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, but, in, the, indistinguishable, case, since, there, is, no, statistical, pressure, toward, equal, numbers, the, most, likely, outcome, is, that, most, of, the, particles, will, collapse, into, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, in, the, distinguishable, case, for, large, n, the, fraction, in, state, 0, displaystyle, 0, rangle, can, be, computed, it, is, the, same, as, flipping, a, coin, with, probability, proportional, to, p, exp, e, t, to, land, tails, in, the, indistinguishable, case, each, value, of, k, is, a, single, state, which, has, its, own, separate, boltzmann, probability, so, the, probability, distribution, is, exponential, for, large, n, the, normalization, constant, c, is, 1, p, the, expected, total, number, of, particles, not, in, the, lowest, energy, state, in, the, limit, that, n, displaystyle, n, rightarrow, infty, is, equal, to, it, does, not, grow, when, n, is, large, it, just, approaches, a, constant, this, will, be, a, negligible, fraction, of, the, total, number, of, particles, so, a, collection, of, enough, bose, particles, in, thermal, equilibrium, will, mostly, be, in, the, ground, state, with, only, a, few, in, any, excited, state, no, matter, how, small, the, energy, difference, consider, now, a, gas, of, particles, which, can, be, in, different, momentum, states, labeled, k, displaystyle, k, rangle, if, the, number, of, particles, is, less, than, the, number, of, thermally, accessible, states, for, high, temperatures, and, low, densities, the, particles, will, all, be, in, different, states, in, this, limit, the, gas, is, classical, as, the, density, increases, or, the, temperature, decreases, the, number, of, accessible, states, per, particle, becomes, smaller, and, at, some, point, more, particles, will, be, forced, into, a, single, state, than, the, maximum, allowed, for, that, state, by, statistical, weighting, from, this, point, on, any, extra, particle, added, will, go, into, the, ground, state, to, calculate, the, transition, temperature, at, any, density, integrate, over, all, momentum, states, the, expression, for, maximum, number, of, excited, particles, p, 1, p, when, the, integral, also, known, as, bose, einstein, integral, is, evaluated, with, factors, of, k, b, displaystyle, k, b, and, restored, by, dimensional, analysis, it, gives, the, critical, temperature, formula, of, the, preceding, section, therefore, this, integral, defines, the, critical, temperature, and, particle, number, corresponding, to, the, conditions, of, negligible, chemical, potential, displaystyle, mu, in, bose, einstein, statistics, distribution, displaystyle, mu, is, actually, still, nonzero, for, becs, however, displaystyle, mu, is, less, than, the, ground, state, energy, except, when, specifically, talking, about, the, ground, state, displaystyle, mu, can, be, approximated, for, most, energy, or, momentum, states, as, 0, displaystyle, mu, approx, 0, nikolay, bogoliubov, considered, perturbations, on, the, limit, of, dilute, gas, finding, a, finite, pressure, at, zero, temperature, and, positive, chemical, potential, this, leads, to, corrections, for, the, ground, state, the, bogoliubov, state, has, pressure, t, 0, p, g, n, 2, 2, displaystyle, p, gn, 2, 2, the, original, interacting, system, can, be, converted, to, a, system, of, non, interacting, particles, with, a, dispersion, law, in, some, simplest, cases, the, state, of, condensed, particles, can, be, described, with, a, nonlinear, schr, dinger, equation, also, known, as, gross, pitaevskii, or, ginzburg, landau, equation, the, validity, of, this, approach, is, actually, limited, to, the, case, of, ultracold, temperatures, which, fits, well, for, the, most, alkali, atoms, experiments, this, approach, originates, from, the, assumption, that, the, state, of, the, bec, can, be, described, by, the, unique, wavefunction, of, the, condensate, r, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, for, a, system, of, this, nature, r, 2, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, 2, is, interpreted, as, the, particle, density, so, the, total, number, of, atoms, is, n, d, r, r, 2, displaystyle, n, int, d, vec, r, psi, vec, r, 2, provided, essentially, all, atoms, are, in, the, condensate, that, is, have, condensed, to, the, ground, state, and, treating, the, bosons, using, mean, field, theory, the, energy, e, associated, with, the, state, r, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, is, minimizing, this, energy, with, respect, to, infinitesimal, variations, in, r, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, and, holding, the, number, of, atoms, constant, yields, the, gross, pitaevski, equation, gpe, also, a, non, linear, schr, dinger, equation, where, in, the, case, of, zero, external, potential, the, dispersion, law, of, interacting, bose, einstein, condensed, particles, is, given, by, so, called, bogoliubov, spectrum, for, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, the, gross, pitaevskii, equation, gpe, provides, a, relatively, good, description, of, the, behavior, of, atomic, bec, s, however, gpe, does, not, take, into, account, the, temperature, dependence, of, dynamical, variables, and, is, therefore, valid, only, for, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, it, is, not, applicable, for, example, for, the, condensates, of, excitons, magnons, and, photons, where, the, critical, temperature, is, comparable, to, room, temperature, the, gross, pitaevskii, equation, is, a, partial, differential, equation, in, space, and, time, variables, usually, it, does, not, have, analytic, solution, and, different, numerical, methods, such, as, split, step, crank, nicolson, and, fourier, spectral, methods, are, used, for, its, solution, there, are, different, fortran, and, c, programs, for, its, solution, for, contact, interaction, and, long, range, dipolar, interaction, which, can, be, freely, used, the, gross, pitaevskii, model, of, bec, is, a, physical, approximation, valid, for, certain, classes, of, becs, by, construction, the, gpe, uses, the, following, simplifications, it, assumes, that, interactions, between, condensate, particles, are, of, the, contact, two, body, type, and, also, neglects, anomalous, contributions, to, self, energy, these, assumptions, are, suitable, mostly, for, the, dilute, three, dimensional, condensates, if, one, relaxes, any, of, these, assumptions, the, equation, for, the, condensate, wavefunction, acquires, the, terms, containing, higher, order, powers, of, the, wavefunction, moreover, for, some, physical, systems, the, amount, of, such, terms, turns, out, to, be, infinite, therefore, the, equation, becomes, essentially, non, polynomial, the, examples, where, this, could, happen, are, the, bose, fermi, composite, condensates, effectively, lower, dimensional, condensates, and, dense, condensates, and, superfluid, clusters, and, droplets, it, is, found, that, one, has, to, go, beyond, the, gross, pitaevskii, equation, for, example, the, logarithmic, term, ln, 2, displaystyle, psi, ln, psi, 2, found, in, the, logarithmic, schr, dinger, equation, must, be, added, to, the, gross, pitaevskii, equation, along, with, a, ginzburg, sobyanin, contribution, to, correctly, determine, that, the, speed, of, sound, scales, as, the, cubic, root, of, pressure, for, helium, 4, at, very, low, temperatures, in, close, agreement, with, experiment, however, it, is, clear, that, in, a, general, case, the, behaviour, of, bose, einstein, condensate, can, be, described, by, coupled, evolution, equations, for, condensate, density, superfluid, velocity, and, distribution, function, of, elementary, excitations, this, problem, was, solved, in, 1977, by, peletminskii, et, al, in, microscopical, approach, the, peletminskii, equations, are, valid, for, any, finite, temperatures, below, the, critical, point, years, after, in, 1985, kirkpatrick, and, dorfman, obtained, similar, equations, using, another, microscopical, approach, the, peletminskii, equations, also, reproduce, khalatnikov, hydrodynamical, equations, for, superfluid, as, a, limiting, case, the, phenomena, of, superfluidity, of, a, bose, gas, and, superconductivity, of, a, strongly, correlated, fermi, gas, a, gas, of, cooper, pairs, are, tightly, connected, to, bose, einstein, condensation, under, corresponding, conditions, below, the, temperature, of, phase, transition, these, phenomena, were, observed, in, helium, 4, and, different, classes, of, superconductors, in, this, sense, the, superconductivity, is, often, called, the, superfluidity, of, fermi, gas, in, the, simplest, form, the, origin, of, superfluidity, can, be, seen, from, the, weakly, interacting, bosons, model, in, 1938, pyotr, kapitsa, john, allen, and, don, misener, discovered, that, helium, 4, became, a, new, kind, of, fluid, now, known, as, a, superfluid, at, temperatures, less, than, 2, 17, k, the, lambda, point, superfluid, helium, has, many, unusual, properties, including, zero, viscosity, the, ability, to, flow, without, dissipating, energy, and, the, existence, of, quantized, vortices, it, was, quickly, believed, that, the, superfluidity, was, due, to, partial, bose, einstein, condensation, of, the, liquid, in, fact, many, properties, of, superfluid, helium, also, appear, in, gaseous, condensates, created, by, cornell, wieman, and, ketterle, see, below, superfluid, helium, 4, is, a, liquid, rather, than, a, gas, which, means, that, the, interactions, between, the, atoms, are, relatively, strong, the, original, theory, of, bose, einstein, condensation, must, be, heavily, modified, in, order, to, describe, it, bose, einstein, condensation, remains, however, fundamental, to, the, superfluid, properties, of, helium, 4, note, that, helium, 3, a, fermion, also, enters, a, superfluid, phase, at, a, much, lower, temperature, which, can, be, explained, by, the, formation, of, bosonic, cooper, pairs, of, two, atoms, see, also, fermionic, condensate, the, first, pure, bose, einstein, condensate, was, created, by, eric, cornell, carl, wieman, and, co, workers, at, jila, on, 5, june, 1995, they, cooled, a, dilute, vapor, of, approximately, two, thousand, rubidium, 87, atoms, to, below, 170, nk, using, a, combination, of, laser, cooling, a, technique, that, won, its, inventors, steven, chu, claude, cohen, tannoudji, and, william, d, phillips, the, 1997, nobel, prize, in, physics, and, magnetic, evaporative, cooling, about, four, months, later, an, independent, effort, led, by, wolfgang, ketterle, at, mit, condensed, sodium, 23, ketterle, s, condensate, had, a, hundred, times, more, atoms, allowing, important, results, such, as, the, observation, of, quantum, mechanical, interference, between, two, different, condensates, cornell, wieman, and, ketterle, won, the, 2001, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, achievements, a, group, led, by, randall, hulet, at, rice, university, announced, a, condensate, of, lithium, atoms, only, one, month, following, the, jila, work, lithium, has, attractive, interactions, causing, the, condensate, to, be, unstable, and, collapse, for, all, but, a, few, atoms, hulet, s, team, subsequently, showed, the, condensate, could, be, stabilized, by, confinement, quantum, pressure, for, up, to, about, 1000, atoms, various, isotopes, have, since, been, condensed, in, the, image, accompanying, this, article, the, velocity, distribution, data, indicates, the, formation, of, a, bose, einstein, condensate, out, of, a, gas, of, rubidium, atoms, the, false, colors, indicate, the, number, of, atoms, at, each, velocity, with, red, being, the, fewest, and, white, being, the, most, the, areas, appearing, white, and, light, blue, are, at, the, lowest, velocities, the, peak, is, not, infinitely, narrow, because, of, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, spatially, confined, atoms, have, a, minimum, width, velocity, distribution, this, width, is, given, by, the, curvature, of, the, magnetic, potential, in, the, given, direction, more, tightly, confined, directions, have, bigger, widths, in, the, ballistic, velocity, distribution, this, anisotropy, of, the, peak, on, the, right, is, a, purely, quantum, mechanical, effect, and, does, not, exist, in, the, thermal, distribution, on, the, left, this, graph, served, as, the, cover, design, for, the, 1999, textbook, thermal, physics, by, ralph, baierlein, bose, einstein, condensation, also, applies, to, quasiparticles, in, solids, magnons, excitons, and, polaritons, have, integer, spin, which, means, they, are, bosons, that, can, form, condensates, magnons, electron, spin, waves, can, be, controlled, by, a, magnetic, field, densities, from, the, limit, of, a, dilute, gas, to, a, strongly, interacting, bose, liquid, are, possible, magnetic, ordering, is, the, analog, of, superfluidity, in, 1999, condensation, was, demonstrated, in, antiferromagnetic, tl, cu, cl, 3, at, temperatures, as, great, as, 14, k, the, high, transition, temperature, relative, to, atomic, gases, is, due, to, the, magnons, small, mass, near, that, of, an, electron, and, greater, achievable, density, in, 2006, condensation, in, a, ferromagnetic, yttrium, iron, garnet, thin, film, was, seen, even, at, room, temperature, with, optical, pumping, excitons, electron, hole, pairs, were, predicted, to, condense, at, low, temperature, and, high, density, by, boer, et, al, in, 1961, bilayer, system, experiments, first, demonstrated, condensation, in, 2003, by, hall, voltage, disappearance, fast, optical, exciton, creation, was, used, to, form, condensates, in, sub, kelvin, cu, 2, o, in, 2005, on, polariton, condensation, was, first, detected, for, exciton, polaritons, in, a, quantum, well, microcavity, kept, at, 5, k, in, june, 2020, the, cold, atom, laboratory, experiment, on, board, the, international, space, station, successfully, created, a, bec, of, rubidium, atoms, and, observed, them, for, over, a, second, in, free, fall, although, initially, just, a, proof, of, function, early, results, showed, that, in, the, microgravity, environment, of, the, iss, about, half, of, the, atoms, formed, into, a, magnetically, insensitive, halo, like, cloud, around, the, main, body, of, the, bec, as, in, many, other, systems, vortices, can, exist, in, becs, vortices, can, be, created, for, example, by, stirring, the, condensate, with, lasers, rotating, the, confining, trap, or, by, rapid, cooling, across, the, phase, transition, the, vortex, created, will, be, a, quantum, vortex, with, core, shape, determined, by, the, interactions, fluid, circulation, around, any, point, is, quantized, due, to, the, single, valued, nature, of, the, order, bec, order, parameter, or, wavefunction, that, can, be, written, in, the, form, r, z, e, i, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, phi, rho, z, e, i, ell, theta, where, z, displaystyle, rho, z, and, displaystyle, theta, are, as, in, the, cylindrical, coordinate, system, and, displaystyle, ell, is, the, angular, quantum, number, a, k, a, the, charge, of, the, vortex, since, the, energy, of, a, vortex, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, its, angular, momentum, in, trivial, topology, only, 1, displaystyle, ell, 1, vortices, can, exist, in, the, steady, state, higher, charge, vortices, will, have, a, tendency, to, split, into, 1, displaystyle, ell, 1, vortices, if, allowed, by, the, topology, of, the, geometry, an, axially, symmetric, for, instance, harmonic, confining, potential, is, commonly, used, for, the, study, of, vortices, in, bec, to, determine, z, displaystyle, phi, rho, z, the, energy, of, r, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, must, be, minimized, according, to, the, constraint, r, z, e, i, displaystyle, psi, vec, r, phi, rho, z, e, i, ell, theta, this, is, usually, done, computationally, however, in, a, uniform, medium, the, following, analytic, form, demonstrates, the, correct, behavior, and, is, a, good, approximation, here, n, displaystyle, n, is, the, density, far, from, the, vortex, and, x,

energy, which, is, well, defined, it, is, necessary, to, include, this, boundary, b, displaystyle, b, for, multiply, charged, vortices, 1, displaystyle, ell, 1, the, energy, is, approximated, by, which, is, greater, than, that, of, displaystyle, ell, singly, charged, vortices, indicating, that, these, multiply, charged, vortices, are, unstable, to, decay, research, has, however, indicated, they, are, metastable, states, so, may, have, relatively, long, lifetimes, closely, related, to, the, creation, of, vortices, in, becs, is, the, generation, of, so, called, dark, solitons, in, one, dimensional, becs, these, topological, objects, feature, a, phase, gradient, across, their, nodal, plane, which, stabilizes, their, shape, even, in, propagation, and, interaction, although, solitons, carry, no, charge, and, are, thus, prone, to, decay, relatively, long, lived, dark, solitons, have, been, produced, and, studied, extensively, experiments, led, by, randall, hulet, at, rice, university, from, 1995, through, 2000, showed, that, lithium, condensates, with, attractive, interactions, could, stably, exist, up, to, a, critical, atom, number, quench, cooling, the, gas, they, observed, the, condensate, to, grow, then, subsequently, collapse, as, the, attraction, overwhelmed, the, zero, point, energy, of, the, confining, potential, in, a, burst, reminiscent, of, a, supernova, with, an, explosion, preceded, by, an, implosion, further, work, on, attractive, condensates, was, performed, in, 2000, by, the, jila, team, of, cornell, wieman, and, coworkers, their, instrumentation, now, had, better, control, so, they, used, naturally, attracting, atoms, of, rubidium, 85, having, negative, atom, atom, scattering, length, through, feshbach, resonance, involving, a, sweep, of, the, magnetic, field, causing, spin, flip, collisions, they, lowered, the, characteristic, discrete, energies, at, which, rubidium, bonds, making, their, rb, 85, atoms, repulsive, and, creating, a, stable, condensate, the, reversible, flip, from, attraction, to, repulsion, stems, from, quantum, interference, among, wave, like, condensate, atoms, when, the, jila, team, raised, the, magnetic, field, strength, further, the, condensate, suddenly, reverted, to, attraction, imploded, and, shrank, beyond, detection, then, exploded, expelling, about, two, thirds, of, its, 10, 000, atoms, about, half, of, the, atoms, in, the, condensate, seemed, to, have, disappeared, from, the, experiment, altogether, not, seen, in, the, cold, remnant, or, expanding, gas, cloud, carl, wieman, explained, that, under, current, atomic, theory, this, characteristic, of, bose, einstein, condensate, could, not, be, explained, because, the, energy, state, of, an, atom, near, absolute, zero, should, not, be, enough, to, cause, an, implosion, however, subsequent, mean, field, theories, have, been, proposed, to, explain, it, most, likely, they, formed, molecules, of, two, rubidium, atoms, energy, gained, by, this, bond, imparts, velocity, sufficient, to, leave, the, trap, without, being, detected, the, process, of, creation, of, molecular, bose, condensate, during, the, sweep, of, the, magnetic, field, throughout, the, feshbach, resonance, as, well, as, the, reverse, process, are, described, by, the, exactly, solvable, model, that, can, explain, many, experimental, observations, compared, to, more, commonly, encountered, states, of, matter, bose, einstein, condensates, are, extremely, fragile, the, slightest, interaction, with, the, external, environment, can, be, enough, to, warm, them, past, the, condensation, threshold, eliminating, their, interesting, properties, and, forming, a, normal, gas, nevertheless, they, have, proven, useful, in, exploring, a, wide, range, of, questions, in, fundamental, physics, and, the, years, since, the, initial, discoveries, by, the, jila, and, mit, groups, have, seen, an, increase, in, experimental, and, theoretical, activity, bose, einstein, condensates, composed, of, a, wide, range, of, isotopes, have, been, produced, see, below, examples, include, experiments, that, have, demonstrated, interference, between, condensates, due, to, wave, particle, duality, the, study, of, superfluidity, and, quantized, vortices, the, creation, of, bright, matter, wave, solitons, from, bose, condensates, confined, to, one, dimension, and, the, slowing, of, light, pulses, to, very, low, speeds, using, electromagnetically, induced, transparency, vortices, in, bose, einstein, condensates, are, also, currently, the, subject, of, analogue, gravity, research, studying, the, possibility, of, modeling, black, holes, and, their, related, phenomena, in, such, environments, in, the, laboratory, experimenters, have, also, realized, optical, lattices, where, the, interference, pattern, from, overlapping, lasers, provides, a, periodic, potential, these, have, been, used, to, explore, the, transition, between, a, superfluid, and, a, mott, insulator, they, are, useful, in, studying, bose, einstein, condensation, in, fewer, than, three, dimensions, for, example, the, tonks, girardeau, gas, further, the, sensitivity, of, the, pinning, transition, of, strongly, interacting, bosons, confined, in, a, shallow, one, dimensional, optical, lattice, originally, observed, by, haller, has, been, explored, via, a, tweaking, of, the, primary, optical, lattice, by, a, secondary, weaker, one, thus, for, a, resulting, weak, bichromatic, optical, lattice, it, has, been, found, that, the, pinning, transition, is, robust, against, the, introduction, of, the, weaker, secondary, optical, lattice, studies, of, vortices, in, nonuniform, bose, einstein, condensates, as, well, as, excitations, of, these, systems, by, the, application, of, moving, repulsive, or, attractive, obstacles, have, also, been, undertaken, within, this, context, the, conditions, for, order, and, chaos, in, the, dynamics, of, a, trapped, bose, einstein, condensate, have, been, explored, by, the, application, of, moving, blue, and, red, detuned, laser, beams, hitting, frequencies, slightly, above, and, below, the, resonance, frequency, respectively, via, the, time, dependent, gross, pitaevskii, equation, in, 1999, danish, physicist, lene, hau, led, a, team, from, harvard, university, which, slowed, a, beam, of, light, to, about, 17, meters, per, second, using, a, superfluid, hau, and, her, associates, have, since, made, a, group, of, condensate, atoms, recoil, from, a, light, pulse, such, that, they, recorded, the, light, s, phase, and, amplitude, recovered, by, a, second, nearby, condensate, in, what, they, term, slow, light, mediated, atomic, matter, wave, amplification, using, bose, einstein, condensates, another, current, research, interest, is, the, creation, of, bose, einstein, condensates, in, microgravity, in, order, to, use, its, properties, for, high, precision, atom, interferometry, the, first, demonstration, of, a, bec, in, weightlessness, was, achieved, in, 2008, at, a, drop, tower, in, bremen, germany, by, a, consortium, of, researchers, led, by, ernst, m, rasel, from, leibniz, university, hannover, the, same, team, demonstrated, in, 2017, the, first, creation, of, a, bose, einstein, condensate, in, space, and, it, is, also, the, subject, of, two, upcoming, experiments, on, the, international, space, station, researchers, in, the, new, field, of, atomtronics, use, the, properties, of, bose, einstein, condensates, in, the, emerging, quantum, technology, of, matter, wave, circuits, in, 1970, becs, were, proposed, by, emmanuel, david, tannenbaum, for, anti, stealth, technology, bose, einstein, condensation, has, mainly, been, observed, on, alkaline, atoms, some, of, which, have, collisional, properties, particularly, suitable, for, evaporative, cooling, in, traps, and, which, where, the, first, to, laser, cooled, as, of, 2021, using, ultra, low, temperatures, of, 10, 7, k, or, below, bose, einstein, condensates, had, been, obtained, for, a, multitude, of, isotopes, with, more, or, less, ease, mainly, of, alkali, metal, alkaline, earth, metal, and, lanthanide, atoms, 7, li, 23, na, 39, k, 41, k, 85, rb, 87, rb, 133, cs, 52, cr, 40, ca, 84, sr, 86, sr, 88, sr, 170, yb, 174, yb, 176, yb, 164, dy, 168, er, 169, tm, and, metastable, 4, he, orthohelium, research, was, finally, successful, in, atomic, hydrogen, with, the, aid, of, the, newly, developed, method, of, evaporative, cooling, in, contrast, the, superfluid, state, of, 4, he, below, 1, 17, k, is, differs, significantly, from, dilute, degenerate, atomic, gases, because, the, interaction, between, the, atoms, is, strong, only, 8, of, atoms, are, in, the, condensed, fraction, near, absolute, zero, rather, than, near, 100, of, a, weakly, interacting, bec, the, bosonic, behavior, of, some, of, these, alkaline, gases, appears, odd, at, first, sight, because, their, nuclei, have, half, integer, total, spin, it, arises, from, the, interplay, of, electronic, and, nuclear, spins, at, ultra, low, temperatures, and, corresponding, excitation, energies, the, half, integer, total, spin, of, the, electronic, shell, one, outer, electron, and, half, integer, total, spin, of, the, nucleus, are, coupled, by, a, very, weak, hyperfine, interaction, the, total, spin, of, the, atom, arising, from, this, coupling, is, an, integer, value, conversely, alkali, isotopes, which, have, an, integer, nuclear, spin, such, as, 6, li, and, 40, k, are, fermions, and, can, form, degenerate, fermi, gases, also, called, fermi, condensates, cooling, fermions, to, extremely, low, temperatures, has, created, degenerate, gases, subject, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, to, exhibit, bose, einstein, condensation, the, fermions, must, pair, up, to, form, bosonic, compound, particles, e, g, molecules, or, cooper, pairs, the, first, molecular, condensates, were, created, in, november, 2003, by, the, groups, of, rudolf, grimm, at, the, university, of, innsbruck, deborah, s, jin, at, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, and, wolfgang, ketterle, at, mit, jin, quickly, went, on, to, create, the, first, fermionic, condensate, working, with, the, same, system, but, outside, the, molecular, regime, limitations, of, evaporative, cooling, have, restricted, atomic, becs, to, pulsed, operation, involving, a, highly, inefficient, duty, cycle, that, discards, more, than, 99, of, atoms, to, reach, bec, achieving, continuous, bec, has, been, a, major, open, problem, of, experimental, bec, research, driven, by, the, same, motivations, as, continuous, optical, laser, development, high, flux, high, coherence, matter, waves, produced, continuously, would, enable, new, sensing, applications, continuous, bec, was, achieved, for, the, first, time, in, 2022, with, 84, sr, in, 2020, researchers, reported, the, development, of, superconducting, bec, and, that, there, appears, to, be, a, smooth, transition, between, bec, and, bardeen, cooper, shrieffer, regimes, p, sikivie, and, q, yang, showed, that, cold, dark, matter, axions, would, form, a, bose, einstein, condensate, by, thermalisation, because, of, gravitational, self, interactions, axions, have, not, yet, been, confirmed, to, exist, however, the, important, search, for, them, has, been, greatly, enhanced, with, the, completion, of, upgrades, to, the, axion, dark, matter, experiment, admx, at, the, university, of, washington, in, early, 2018, in, 2014, a, potential, dibaryon, was, detected, at, the, j, lich, research, center, at, about, 2380, mev, the, center, claimed, that, the, measurements, confirm, results, from, 2011, via, a, more, replicable, method, the, particle, existed, for, 10, 23, seconds, and, was, named, d, 2380, this, particle, is, hypothesized, to, consist, of, three, up, and, three, down, quarks, it, is, theorized, that, groups, of, d, d, stars, could, form, bose, einstein, condensates, due, to, prevailing, low, temperatures, in, the, early, universe, and, that, becs, made, of, such, hexaquarks, with, trapped, electrons, could, behave, like, dark, matter
