condensed, matter, physics, is, the, field, of, physics, that, deals, with, the, macroscopic, and, microscopic, physical, properties, of, matter, especially, the, solid, and, liquid, phases, that, arise, from, electromagnetic, forces, between, atoms, and, electrons, more, generally, the, subject, deals, with, condensed, phases, of, matter, systems, of, many, constituents, with, strong, interactions, among, them, more, exotic, condensed, phases, include, the, superconducting, phase, exhibited, by, certain, materials, at, extremely, low, cryogenic, temperatures, the, ferromagnetic, and, antiferromagnetic, phases, of, spins, on, crystal, lattices, of, atoms, the, bose, einstein, condensates, found, in, ultracold, atomic, systems, and, liquid, crystals, condensed, matter, physicists, seek, to, understand, the, behavior, of, these, phases, by, experiments, to, measure, various, material, properties, and, by, applying, the, physical, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical, mechanics, and, other, physics, theories, to, develop, mathematical, models, and, predict, the, properties, of, extremely, large, groups, of, atoms, the, diversity, of, systems, and, phenomena, available, for, study, makes, condensed, matter, physics, the, most, active, field, of, contemporary, physics, one, third, of, all, american, physicists, self, identify, as, condensed, matter, physicists, and, the, division, of, condensed, matter, physics, is, the, largest, division, of, the, american, physical, society, these, include, solid, state, and, soft, matter, physicists, who, study, quantum, and, non, quantum, physical, properties, of, matter, respectively, both, types, study, a, great, range, of, materials, providing, many, research, funding, and, employment, opportunities, the, field, overlaps, with, chemistry, materials, science, engineering, and, nanotechnology, and, relates, closely, to, atomic, physics, and, biophysics, the, theoretical, physics, of, condensed, matter, shares, important, concepts, and, methods, with, that, of, particle, physics, and, nuclear, physics, a, variety, of, topics, in, physics, such, as, crystallography, metallurgy, elasticity, magnetism, etc, were, treated, as, distinct, areas, until, the, 1940s, when, they, were, grouped, together, as, solid, state, physics, around, the, 1960s, the, study, of, physical, properties, of, liquids, was, added, to, this, list, forming, the, basis, for, the, more, comprehensive, specialty, of, condensed, matter, physics, the, bell, telephone, laboratories, was, one, of, the, first, institutes, to, conduct, a, research, program, in, condensed, matter, physics, according, to, the, founding, director, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, solid, state, research, physics, professor, manuel, cardona, it, was, albert, einstein, who, created, the, modern, field, of, condensed, matter, physics, starting, with, his, seminal, 1905, article, on, the, photoelectric, effect, and, photoluminescence, which, opened, the, fields, of, photoelectron, spectroscopy, and, photoluminescence, spectroscopy, and, later, his, 1907, article, on, the, specific, heat, of, solids, which, introduced, for, the, first, time, the, effect, of, lattice, vibrations, on, the, thermodynamic, properties, of, crystals, in, particular, the, specific, heat, deputy, director, of, the, yale, quantum, institute, a, douglas, stone, makes, a, similar, priority, case, for, einstein, in, his, work, on, the, synthetic, history, of, quantum, mechanics, according, to, physicist, philip, warren, anderson, the, use, of, the, term, condensed, matter, to, designate, a, field, of, study, was, coined, by, him, and, volker, heine, when, they, changed, the, name, of, their, group, at, the, cavendish, laboratories, cambridge, from, solid, state, theory, to, theory, of, condensed, matter, in, 1967, as, they, felt, it, better, included, their, interest, in, liquids, nuclear, matter, and, so, on, although, anderson, and, heine, helped, popularize, the, name, condensed, matter, it, had, been, used, in, europe, for, some, years, most, prominently, in, the, springer, verlag, journal, physics, of, condensed, matter, launched, in, 1963, the, name, condensed, matter, physics, emphasized, the, commonality, of, scientific, problems, encountered, by, physicists, working, on, solids, liquids, plasmas, and, other, complex, matter, whereas, solid, state, physics, was, often, associated, with, restricted, industrial, applications, of, metals, and, semiconductors, in, the, 1960s, and, 70s, some, physicists, felt, the, more, comprehensive, name, better, fit, the, funding, environment, and, cold, war, politics, of, the, time, references, to, condensed, states, can, be, traced, to, earlier, sources, for, example, in, the, introduction, to, his, 1947, book, kinetic, theory, of, liquids, yakov, frenkel, proposed, that, the, kinetic, theory, of, liquids, must, accordingly, be, developed, as, a, generalization, and, extension, of, the, kinetic, theory, of, solid, bodies, as, a, matter, of, fact, it, would, be, more, correct, to, unify, them, under, the, title, of, condensed, bodies, one, of, the, first, studies, of, condensed, states, of, matter, was, by, english, chemist, humphry, davy, in, the, first, decades, of, the, nineteenth, century, davy, observed, that, of, the, forty, chemical, elements, known, at, the, time, twenty, six, had, metallic, properties, such, as, lustre, ductility, and, high, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, this, indicated, that, the, atoms, in, john, dalton, s, atomic, theory, were, not, indivisible, as, dalton, claimed, but, had, inner, structure, davy, further, claimed, that, elements, that, were, then, believed, to, be, gases, such, as, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, could, be, liquefied, under, the, right, conditions, and, would, then, behave, as, metals, in, 1823, michael, faraday, then, an, assistant, in, davy, s, lab, successfully, liquefied, chlorine, and, went, on, to, liquefy, all, known, gaseous, elements, except, for, nitrogen, hydrogen, and, oxygen, shortly, after, in, 1869, irish, chemist, thomas, andrews, studied, the, phase, transition, from, a, liquid, to, a, gas, and, coined, the, term, critical, point, to, describe, the, condition, where, a, gas, and, a, liquid, were, indistinguishable, as, phases, and, dutch, physicist, johannes, van, der, waals, supplied, the, theoretical, framework, which, allowed, the, prediction, of, critical, behavior, based, on, measurements, at, much, higher, temperatures, 35, 38, by, 1908, james, dewar, and, heike, kamerlingh, onnes, were, successfully, able, to, liquefy, hydrogen, and, the, then, newly, discovered, helium, respectively, paul, drude, in, 1900, proposed, the, first, theoretical, model, for, a, classical, electron, moving, through, a, metallic, solid, drude, s, model, described, properties, of, metals, in, terms, of, a, gas, of, free, electrons, and, was, the, first, microscopic, model, to, explain, empirical, observations, such, as, the, wiedemann, franz, law, 27, 29, however, despite, the, success, of, drude, s, model, it, had, one, notable, problem, it, was, unable, to, correctly, explain, the, electronic, contribution, to, the, specific, heat, and, magnetic, properties, of, metals, and, the, temperature, dependence, of, resistivity, at, low, temperatures, 366, 368, in, 1911, three, years, after, helium, was, first, liquefied, onnes, working, at, university, of, leiden, discovered, superconductivity, in, mercury, when, he, observed, the, electrical, resistivity, of, mercury, to, vanish, at, temperatures, below, a, certain, value, the, phenomenon, completely, surprised, the, best, theoretical, physicists, of, the, time, and, it, remained, unexplained, for, several, decades, albert, einstein, in, 1922, said, regarding, contemporary, theories, of, superconductivity, that, with, our, far, reaching, ignorance, of, the, quantum, mechanics, of, composite, systems, we, are, very, far, from, being, able, to, compose, a, theory, out, of, these, vague, ideas, drude, s, classical, model, was, augmented, by, wolfgang, pauli, arnold, sommerfeld, felix, bloch, and, other, physicists, pauli, realized, that, the, free, electrons, in, metal, must, obey, the, fermi, dirac, statistics, using, this, idea, he, developed, the, theory, of, paramagnetism, in, 1926, shortly, after, sommerfeld, incorporated, the, fermi, dirac, statistics, into, the, free, electron, model, and, made, it, better, to, explain, the, heat, capacity, two, years, later, bloch, used, quantum, mechanics, to, describe, the, motion, of, an, electron, in, a, periodic, lattice, 366, 368, the, mathematics, of, crystal, structures, developed, by, auguste, bravais, yevgraf, fyodorov, and, others, was, used, to, classify, crystals, by, their, symmetry, group, and, tables, of, crystal, structures, were, the, basis, for, the, series, international, tables, of, crystallography, first, published, in, 1935, band, structure, calculations, were, first, used, in, 1930, to, predict, the, properties, of, new, materials, and, in, 1947, john, bardeen, walter, brattain, and, william, shockley, developed, the, first, semiconductor, based, transistor, heralding, a, revolution, in, electronics, in, 1879, edwin, herbert, hall, working, at, the, johns, hopkins, university, discovered, that, a, voltage, developed, across, conductors, which, was, transverse, to, both, an, electric, current, in, the, conductor, and, a, magnetic, field, applied, perpendicular, to, the, current, this, phenomenon, arising, due, to, the, nature, of, charge, carriers, in, the, conductor, came, to, be, termed, the, hall, effect, but, it, was, not, properly, explained, at, the, time, because, the, electron, was, not, experimentally, discovered, until, 18, years, later, after, the, advent, of, quantum, mechanics, lev, landau, in, 1930, developed, the, theory, of, landau, quantization, and, laid, the, foundation, for, a, theoretical, explanation, of, the, quantum, hall, effect, which, was, discovered, half, a, century, later, 458, 460, magnetism, as, a, property, of, matter, has, been, known, in, china, since, 4000, bc, 1, 2, however, the, first, modern, studies, of, magnetism, only, started, with, the, development, of, electrodynamics, by, faraday, maxwell, and, others, in, the, nineteenth, century, which, included, classifying, materials, as, ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and, diamagnetic, based, on, their, response, to, magnetization, pierre, curie, studied, the, dependence, of, magnetization, on, temperature, and, discovered, the, curie, point, phase, transition, in, ferromagnetic, materials, in, 1906, pierre, weiss, introduced, the, concept, of, magnetic, domains, to, explain, the, main, properties, of, ferromagnets, 9, the, first, attempt, at, a, microscopic, description, of, magnetism, was, by, wilhelm, lenz, and, ernst, ising, through, the, ising, model, that, described, magnetic, materials, as, consisting, of, a, periodic, lattice, of, spins, that, collectively, acquired, magnetization, the, ising, model, was, solved, exactly, to, show, that, spontaneous, magnetization, can, occur, in, one, dimension, and, it, is, possible, in, higher, dimensional, lattices, further, research, such, as, by, bloch, on, spin, waves, and, n, el, on, antiferromagnetism, led, to, developing, new, magnetic, materials, with, applications, to, magnetic, storage, devices, 36, 38, g48, the, sommerfeld, model, and, spin, models, for, ferromagnetism, illustrated, the, successful, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, condensed, matter, problems, in, the, 1930s, however, there, still, were, several, unsolved, problems, most, notably, the, description, of, superconductivity, and, the, kondo, effect, after, world, war, ii, several, ideas, from, quantum, field, theory, were, applied, to, condensed, matter, problems, these, included, recognition, of, collective, excitation, modes, of, solids, and, the, important, notion, of, a, quasiparticle, soviet, physicist, lev, landau, used, the, idea, for, the, fermi, liquid, theory, wherein, low, energy, properties, of, interacting, fermion, systems, were, given, in, terms, of, what, are, now, termed, landau, quasiparticles, landau, also, developed, a, mean, field, theory, for, continuous, phase, transitions, which, described, ordered, phases, as, spontaneous, breakdown, of, symmetry, the, theory, also, introduced, the, notion, of, an, order, parameter, to, distinguish, between, ordered, phases, eventually, in, 1956, john, bardeen, leon, cooper, and, robert, schrieffer, developed, the, so, called, bcs, theory, of, superconductivity, based, on, the, discovery, that, arbitrarily, small, attraction, between, two, electrons, of, opposite, spin, mediated, by, phonons, in, the, lattice, can, give, rise, to, a, bound, state, called, a, cooper, pair, the, study, of, phase, transitions, and, the, critical, behavior, of, observables, termed, critical, phenomena, was, a, major, field, of, interest, in, the, 1960s, leo, kadanoff, benjamin, widom, and, michael, fisher, developed, the, ideas, of, critical, exponents, and, widom, scaling, these, ideas, were, unified, by, kenneth, g, wilson, in, 1972, under, the, formalism, of, the, renormalization, group, in, the, context, of, quantum, field, theory, the, quantum, hall, effect, was, discovered, by, klaus, von, klitzing, dorda, and, pepper, in, 1980, when, they, observed, the, hall, conductance, to, be, integer, multiples, of, a, fundamental, constant, e, 2, h, displaystyle, e, 2, h, see, figure, the, effect, was, observed, to, be, independent, of, parameters, such, as, system, size, and, impurities, in, 1981, theorist, robert, laughlin, proposed, a, theory, explaining, the, unanticipated, precision, of, the, integral, plateau, it, also, implied, that, the, hall, conductance, is, proportional, to, a, topological, invariant, called, chern, number, whose, relevance, for, the, band, structure, of, solids, was, formulated, by, david, j, thouless, and, collaborators, 69, 74, shortly, after, in, 1982, horst, st, rmer, and, daniel, tsui, observed, the, fractional, quantum, hall, effect, where, the, conductance, was, now, a, rational, multiple, of, the, constant, e, 2, h, displaystyle, e, 2, h, laughlin, in, 1983, realized, that, this, was, a, consequence, of, quasiparticle, interaction, in, the, hall, states, and, formulated, a, variational, method, solution, named, the, laughlin, wavefunction, the, study, of, topological, properties, of, the, fractional, hall, effect, remains, an, active, field, of, research, decades, later, the, aforementioned, topological, band, theory, advanced, by, david, j, thouless, and, collaborators, was, further, expanded, leading, to, the, discovery, of, topological, insulators, in, 1986, karl, m, ller, and, johannes, bednorz, discovered, the, first, high, temperature, superconductor, la, 2, x, ba, x, cuo, 4, which, is, superconducting, at, temperatures, as, high, as, 39, kelvin, it, was, realized, that, the, high, temperature, superconductors, are, examples, of, strongly, correlated, materials, where, the, electron, electron, interactions, play, an, important, role, a, satisfactory, theoretical, description, of, high, temperature, superconductors, is, still, not, known, and, the, field, of, strongly, correlated, materials, continues, to, be, an, active, research, topic, in, 2012, several, groups, released, preprints, which, suggest, that, samarium, hexaboride, has, the, properties, of, a, topological, insulator, in, accord, with, the, earlier, theoretical, predictions, since, samarium, hexaboride, is, an, established, kondo, insulator, i, e, a, strongly, correlated, electron, material, it, is, expected, that, the, existence, of, a, topological, dirac, surface, state, in, this, material, would, lead, to, a, topological, insulator, with, strong, electronic, correlations, theoretical, condensed, matter, physics, involves, the, use, of, theoretical, models, to, understand, properties, of, states, of, matter, these, include, models, to, study, the, electronic, properties, of, solids, such, as, the, drude, model, the, band, structure, and, the, density, functional, theory, theoretical, models, have, also, been, developed, to, study, the, physics, of, phase, transitions, such, as, the, ginzburg, landau, theory, critical, exponents, and, the, use, of, mathematical, methods, of, quantum, field, theory, and, the, renormalization, group, modern, theoretical, studies, involve, the, use, of, numerical, computation, of, electronic, structure, and, mathematical, tools, to, understand, phenomena, such, as, high, temperature, superconductivity, topological, phases, and, gauge, symmetries, theoretical, understanding, of, condensed, matter, physics, is, closely, related, to, the, notion, of, emergence, wherein, complex, assemblies, of, particles, behave, in, ways, dramatically, different, from, their, individual, constituents, for, example, a, range, of, phenomena, related, to, high, temperature, superconductivity, are, understood, poorly, although, the, microscopic, physics, of, individual, electrons, and, lattices, is, well, known, similarly, models, of, condensed, matter, systems, have, been, studied, where, collective, excitations, behave, like, photons, and, electrons, thereby, describing, electromagnetism, as, an, emergent, phenomenon, emergent, properties, can, also, occur, at, the, interface, between, materials, one, example, is, the, lanthanum, aluminate, strontium, titanate, interface, where, two, band, insulators, are, joined, to, create, conductivity, and, superconductivity, the, metallic, state, has, historically, been, an, important, building, block, for, studying, properties, of, solids, the, first, theoretical, description, of, metals, was, given, by, paul, drude, in, 1900, with, the, drude, model, which, explained, electrical, and, thermal, properties, by, describing, a, metal, as, an, ideal, gas, of, then, newly, discovered, electrons, he, was, able, to, derive, the, empirical, wiedemann, franz, law, and, get, results, in, close, agreement, with, the, experiments, 90, 91, this, classical, model, was, then, improved, by, arnold, sommerfeld, who, incorporated, the, fermi, dirac, statistics, of, electrons, and, was, able, to, explain, the, anomalous, behavior, of, the, specific, heat, of, metals, in, the, wiedemann, franz, law, 101, 103, in, 1912, the, structure, of, crystalline, solids, was, studied, by, max, von, laue, and, paul, knipping, when, they, observed, the, x, ray, diffraction, pattern, of, crystals, and, concluded, that, crystals, get, their, structure, from, periodic, lattices, of, atoms, 48, in, 1928, swiss, physicist, felix, bloch, provided, a, wave, function, solution, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, with, a, periodic, potential, known, as, bloch, s, theorem, calculating, electronic, properties, of, metals, by, solving, the, many, body, wavefunction, is, often, computationally, hard, and, hence, approximation, methods, are, needed, to, obtain, meaningful, predictions, the, thomas, fermi, theory, developed, in, the, 1920s, was, used, to, estimate, system, energy, and, electronic, density, by, treating, the, local, electron, density, as, a, variational, parameter, later, in, the, 1930s, douglas, hartree, vladimir, fock, and, john, slater, developed, the, so, called, hartree, fock, wavefunction, as, an, improvement, over, the, thomas, fermi, model, the, hartree, fock, method, accounted, for, exchange, statistics, of, single, particle, electron, wavefunctions, in, general, it, is, very, difficult, to, solve, the, hartree, fock, equation, only, the, free, electron, gas, case, can, be, solved, exactly, 330, 337, finally, in, 1964, 65, walter, kohn, pierre, hohenberg, and, lu, jeu, sham, proposed, the, density, functional, theory, dft, which, gave, realistic, descriptions, for, bulk, and, surface, properties, of, metals, the, density, functional, theory, has, been, widely, used, since, the, 1970s, for, band, structure, calculations, of, variety, of, solids, some, states, of, matter, exhibit, symmetry, breaking, where, the, relevant, laws, of, physics, possess, some, form, of, symmetry, that, is, broken, a, common, example, is, crystalline, solids, which, break, continuous, translational, symmetry, other, examples, include, magnetized, ferromagnets, which, break, rotational, symmetry, and, more, exotic, states, such, as, the, ground, state, of, a, bcs, superconductor, that, breaks, u, 1, phase, rotational, symmetry, goldstone, s, theorem, in, quantum, field, theory, states, that, in, a, system, with, broken, continuous, symmetry, there, may, exist, excitations, with, arbitrarily, low, energy, called, the, goldstone, bosons, for, example, in, crystalline, solids, these, correspond, to, phonons, which, are, quantized, versions, of, lattice, vibrations, phase, transition, refers, to, the, change, of, phase, of, a, system, which, is, brought, about, by, change, in, an, external, parameter, such, as, temperature, pressure, or, molar, composition, in, a, single, component, system, a, classical, phase, transition, occurs, at, a, temperature, at, a, specific, pressure, where, there, is, an, abrupt, change, in, the, order, of, the, system, for, example, when, ice, melts, and, becomes, water, the, ordered, hexagonal, crystal, structure, of, ice, is, modified, to, a, hydrogen, bonded, mobile, arrangement, of, water, molecules, in, quantum, phase, transitions, the, temperature, is, set, to, absolute, zero, and, the, non, thermal, control, parameter, such, as, pressure, or, magnetic, field, causes, the, phase, transitions, when, order, is, destroyed, by, quantum, fluctuations, originating, from, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, here, the, different, quantum, phases, of, the, system, refer, to, distinct, ground, states, of, the, hamiltonian, matrix, understanding, the, behavior, of, quantum, phase, transition, is, important, in, the, difficult, tasks, of, explaining, the, properties, of, rare, earth, magnetic, insulators, high, temperature, superconductors, and, other, substances, two, classes, of, phase, transitions, occur, first, order, transitions, and, second, order, or, continuous, transitions, for, the, latter, the, two, phases, involved, do, not, co, exist, at, the, transition, temperature, also, called, the, critical, point, near, the, critical, point, systems, undergo, critical, behavior, wherein, several, of, their, properties, such, as, correlation, length, specific, heat, and, magnetic, susceptibility, diverge, exponentially, these, critical, phenomena, present, serious, challenges, to, physicists, because, normal, macroscopic, laws, are, no, longer, valid, in, the, region, and, novel, ideas, and, methods, must, be, invented, to, find, the, new, laws, that, can, describe, the, system, 75ff, the, simplest, theory, that, can, describe, continuous, phase, transitions, is, the, ginzburg, landau, theory, which, works, in, the, so, called, mean, field, approximation, however, it, can, only, roughly, explain, continuous, phase, transition, for, ferroelectrics, and, type, i, superconductors, which, involves, long, range, microscopic, interactions, for, other, types, of, systems, that, involves, short, range, interactions, near, the, critical, point, a, better, theory, is, needed, 8, 11, near, the, critical, point, the, fluctuations, happen, over, broad, range, of, size, scales, while, the, feature, of, the, whole, system, is, scale, invariant, renormalization, group, methods, successively, average, out, the, shortest, wavelength, fluctuations, in, stages, while, retaining, their, effects, into, the, next, stage, thus, the, changes, of, a, physical, system, as, viewed, at, different, size, scales, can, be, investigated, systematically, the, methods, together, with, powerful, computer, simulation, contribute, greatly, to, the, explanation, of, the, critical, phenomena, associated, with, continuous, phase, transition, 11, experimental, condensed, matter, physics, involves, the, use, of, experimental, probes, to, try, to, discover, new, properties, of, materials, such, probes, include, effects, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, measuring, response, functions, transport, properties, and, thermometry, commonly, used, experimental, methods, include, spectroscopy, with, probes, such, as, x, rays, infrared, light, and, inelastic, neutron, scattering, study, of, thermal, response, such, as, specific, heat, and, measuring, transport, via, thermal, and, heat, conduction, several, condensed, matter, experiments, involve, scattering, of, an, experimental, probe, such, as, x, ray, optical, photons, neutrons, etc, on, constituents, of, a, material, the, choice, of, scattering, probe, depends, on, the, observation, energy, scale, of, interest, visible, light, has, energy, on, the, scale, of, 1, electron, volt, ev, and, is, used, as, a, scattering, probe, to, measure, variations, in, material, properties, such, as, the, dielectric, constant, and, refractive, index, x, rays, have, energies, of, the, order, of, 10, kev, and, hence, are, able, to, probe, atomic, length, scales, and, are, used, to, measure, variations, in, electron, charge, density, and, crystal, structure, 33, 34, neutrons, can, also, probe, atomic, length, scales, and, are, used, to, study, the, scattering, off, nuclei, and, electron, spins, and, magnetization, as, neutrons, have, spin, but, no, charge, coulomb, and, mott, scattering, measurements, can, be, made, by, using, electron, beams, as, scattering, probes, 33, 34, 39, 43, similarly, positron, annihilation, can, be, used, as, an, indirect, measurement, of, local, electron, density, laser, spectroscopy, is, an, excellent, tool, for, studying, the, microscopic, properties, of, a, medium, for, example, to, study, forbidden, transitions, in, media, with, nonlinear, optical, spectroscopy, 258, 259, in, experimental, condensed, matter, physics, external, magnetic, fields, act, as, thermodynamic, variables, that, control, the, state, phase, transitions, and, properties, of, material, systems, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, is, a, method, by, which, external, magnetic, fields, are, used, to, find, resonance, modes, of, individual, nuclei, thus, giving, information, about, the, atomic, molecular, and, bond, structure, of, their, environment, nmr, experiments, can, be, made, in, magnetic, fields, with, strengths, up, to, 60, tesla, higher, magnetic, fields, can, improve, the, quality, of, nmr, measurement, data, 69, 185, quantum, oscillations, is, another, experimental, method, where, high, magnetic, fields, are, used, to, study, material, properties, such, as, the, geometry, of, the, fermi, surface, high, magnetic, fields, will, be, useful, in, experimental, testing, of, the, various, theoretical, predictions, such, as, the, quantized, magnetoelectric, effect, image, magnetic, monopole, and, the, half, integer, quantum, hall, effect, 57, the, local, structure, as, well, as, the, structure, of, the, nearest, neighbour, atoms, can, be, investigated, in, condensed, matter, with, magnetic, resonance, methods, such, as, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, epr, and, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, which, are, very, sensitive, to, the, details, of, the, surrounding, of, nuclei, and, electrons, by, means, of, the, hyperfine, coupling, both, localized, electrons, and, specific, stable, or, unstable, isotopes, of, the, nuclei, become, the, probe, of, these, hyperfine, interactions, which, couple, the, electron, or, nuclear, spin, to, the, local, electric, and, magnetic, fields, these, methods, are, suitable, to, study, defects, diffusion, phase, transitions, and, magnetic, order, common, experimental, methods, include, nmr, nuclear, quadrupole, resonance, nqr, implanted, radioactive, probes, as, in, the, case, of, muon, spin, spectroscopy, displaystyle, mu, sr, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, displaystyle, beta, nmr, and, perturbed, angular, correlation, pac, pac, is, especially, ideal, for, the, study, of, phase, changes, at, extreme, temperatures, above, 2000, c, due, to, the, temperature, independence, of, the, method, ultracold, atom, trapping, in, optical, lattices, is, an, experimental, tool, commonly, used, in, condensed, matter, physics, and, in, atomic, molecular, and, optical, physics, the, method, involves, using, optical, lasers, to, form, an, interference, pattern, which, acts, as, a, lattice, in, which, ions, or, atoms, can, be, placed, at, very, low, temperatures, cold, atoms, in, optical, lattices, are, used, as, quantum, simulators, that, is, they, act, as, controllable, systems, that, can, model, behavior, of, more, complicated, systems, such, as, frustrated, magnets, in, particular, they, are, used, to, engineer, one, two, and, three, dimensional, lattices, for, a, hubbard, model, with, pre, specified, parameters, and, to, study, phase, transitions, for, antiferromagnetic, and, spin, liquid, ordering, in, 1995, a, gas, of, rubidium, atoms, cooled, down, to, a, temperature, of, 170, nk, was, used, to, experimentally, realize, the, bose, einstein, condensate, a, novel, state, of, matter, originally, predicted, by, s, n, bose, and, albert, einstein, wherein, a, large, number, of, atoms, occupy, one, quantum, state, research, in, condensed, matter, physics, has, given, rise, to, several, device, applications, such, as, the, development, of, the, semiconductor, transistor, laser, technology, magnetic, storage, liquid, crystals, optical, fibres, and, several, phenomena, studied, in, the, context, of, nanotechnology, 111ff, methods, such, as, scanning, tunneling, microscopy, can, be, used, to, control, processes, at, the, nanometer, scale, and, have, given, rise, to, the, study, of, nanofabrication, such, molecular, machines, were, developed, for, example, by, nobel, laureates, in, chemistry, ben, feringa, jean, pierre, sauvage, and, fraser, stoddart, feringa, and, his, team, developed, multiple, molecular, machines, such, as, the, molecular, car, molecular, windmill, and, many, more, in, quantum, computation, information, is, represented, by, quantum, bits, or, qubits, the, qubits, may, decohere, quickly, before, useful, computation, is, completed, this, serious, problem, must, be, solved, before, quantum, computing, may, be, realized, to, solve, this, problem, several, promising, approaches, are, proposed, in, condensed, matter, physics, including, josephson, junction, qubits, spintronic, qubits, using, the, spin, orientation, of, magnetic, materials, and, the, topological, non, abelian, anyons, from, fractional, quantum, hall, effect, states, condensed, matter, physics, also, has, important, uses, for, biomedicine, for, example, the, experimental, method, of, magnetic, resonance, imaging, which, is, widely, used, in, medical, diagnosis
