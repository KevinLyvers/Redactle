a, mixture, is, a, material, made, up, of, two, or, more, different, chemical, substances, which, can, be, separated, by, physical, method, a, mixture, is, the, physical, combination, of, two, or, more, substances, in, which, the, identities, are, retained, and, are, mixed, in, the, form, of, solutions, suspensions, and, colloids, mixtures, are, one, product, of, mechanically, blending, or, mixing, chemical, substances, such, as, elements, and, compounds, without, chemical, bonding, or, other, chemical, change, so, that, each, ingredient, substance, retains, its, own, chemical, properties, and, makeup, despite, the, fact, that, there, are, no, chemical, changes, to, its, constituents, the, physical, properties, of, a, mixture, such, as, its, melting, point, may, differ, from, those, of, the, components, some, mixtures, can, be, separated, into, their, components, by, using, physical, mechanical, or, thermal, means, azeotropes, are, one, kind, of, mixture, that, usually, poses, considerable, difficulties, regarding, the, separation, processes, required, to, obtain, their, constituents, physical, or, chemical, processes, or, even, a, blend, of, them, all, mixtures, can, be, characterized, as, being, separable, by, mechanical, means, e, g, purification, distillation, electrolysis, chromatography, heat, filtration, gravitational, sorting, centrifugation, mixtures, differ, from, chemical, compounds, in, the, following, ways, in, the, example, of, sand, and, water, neither, one, of, the, two, substances, changed, in, any, way, when, they, are, mixed, although, the, sand, is, in, the, water, it, still, keeps, the, same, properties, that, it, had, when, it, was, outside, the, water, the, following, table, shows, the, main, properties, and, examples, for, all, possible, phase, combinations, of, the, three, families, of, mixtures, mixtures, can, be, either, homogeneous, or, heterogeneous, a, mixture, of, uniform, composition, and, in, which, all, components, are, in, the, same, phase, such, as, salt, in, water, is, called, homogeneous, whereas, a, mixture, of, non, uniform, composition, and, of, which, the, components, can, be, easily, identified, such, as, sand, in, water, it, is, called, heterogeneous, in, addition, uniform, mixture, is, another, term, for, homogeneous, mixture, and, non, uniform, mixture, is, another, term, for, heterogeneous, mixture, these, terms, are, derived, from, the, idea, that, a, homogeneous, mixture, has, a, uniform, appearance, or, only, one, visible, phase, because, the, particles, are, evenly, distributed, however, a, heterogeneous, mixture, has, non, uniform, composition, and, its, constituent, substances, are, easily, distinguishable, from, one, another, often, but, not, always, in, different, phases, several, solid, substances, such, as, salt, and, sugar, dissolve, in, water, to, form, a, special, type, of, homogeneous, mixture, called, a, solution, in, which, there, is, both, a, solute, dissolved, substance, and, solvent, dissolving, medium, present, air, is, an, example, of, a, solution, as, well, a, homogeneous, mixture, of, gaseous, nitrogen, solvent, in, which, oxygen, and, smaller, amounts, of, other, gaseous, solutes, are, dissolved, mixtures, are, not, limited, in, either, their, number, of, substances, or, the, amounts, of, those, substances, though, in, a, homogeneous, mixture, the, solute, to, solvent, proportion, can, only, reach, a, certain, point, before, the, mixture, separates, and, becomes, heterogeneous, a, homogeneous, mixture, is, characterized, by, uniform, dispersion, of, its, constituent, substances, throughout, the, substances, exist, in, equal, proportion, everywhere, within, the, mixture, differently, put, a, homogeneous, mixture, will, be, the, same, no, matter, from, where, in, the, mixture, it, is, sampled, for, example, if, a, solid, liquid, solution, is, divided, into, two, halves, of, equal, volume, the, halves, will, contain, equal, amounts, of, both, the, liquid, medium, and, dissolved, solid, solvent, and, solute, in, physical, chemistry, and, materials, science, homogeneous, more, narrowly, describes, substances, and, mixtures, which, are, in, a, single, phase, a, solution, is, a, special, type, of, homogeneous, mixture, where, the, ratio, of, solute, to, solvent, remains, the, same, throughout, the, solution, and, the, particles, are, not, visible, with, the, naked, eye, even, if, homogenized, with, multiple, sources, in, solutions, solutes, will, not, settle, out, after, any, period, of, time, and, they, cannot, be, removed, by, physical, methods, such, as, a, filter, or, centrifuge, as, a, homogeneous, mixture, a, solution, has, one, phase, solid, liquid, or, gas, although, the, phase, of, the, solute, and, solvent, may, initially, have, been, different, e, g, salt, water, gases, exhibit, by, far, the, greatest, space, and, consequently, the, weakest, intermolecular, forces, between, their, atoms, or, molecules, since, intermolecular, interactions, are, minuscule, in, comparison, to, those, in, liquids, and, solids, dilute, gases, very, easily, form, solutions, with, one, another, air, is, one, such, example, it, can, be, more, specifically, described, as, a, gaseous, solution, of, oxygen, and, other, gases, dissolved, in, nitrogen, its, major, component, the, basic, properties, of, solutions, are, as, drafted, under, examples, of, heterogeneous, mixtures, are, emulsions, and, foams, in, most, cases, the, mixture, consists, of, two, main, constituents, for, an, emulsion, these, are, immiscible, fluids, such, as, water, and, oil, for, a, foam, these, are, a, solid, and, a, fluid, or, a, liquid, and, a, gas, on, larger, scales, both, constituents, are, present, in, any, region, of, the, mixture, and, in, a, well, mixed, mixture, in, the, same, or, only, slightly, varying, concentrations, on, a, microscopic, scale, however, one, of, the, constituents, is, absent, in, almost, any, sufficiently, small, region, if, such, absence, is, common, on, macroscopic, scales, the, combination, of, the, constituents, is, a, dispersed, medium, not, a, mixture, one, can, distinguish, different, characteristics, of, heterogeneous, mixtures, by, the, presence, or, absence, of, continuum, percolation, of, their, constituents, for, a, foam, a, distinction, is, made, between, reticulated, foam, in, which, one, constituent, forms, a, connected, network, through, which, the, other, can, freely, percolate, or, a, closed, cell, foam, in, which, one, constituent, is, present, as, trapped, in, small, cells, whose, walls, are, formed, by, the, other, constituents, a, similar, distinction, is, possible, for, emulsions, in, many, emulsions, one, constituent, is, present, in, the, form, of, isolated, regions, of, typically, a, globular, shape, dispersed, throughout, the, other, constituent, however, it, is, also, possible, each, constituent, forms, a, large, connected, network, such, a, mixture, is, then, called, bicontinuous, making, a, distinction, between, homogeneous, and, heterogeneous, mixtures, is, a, matter, of, the, scale, of, sampling, on, a, coarse, enough, scale, any, mixture, can, be, said, to, be, homogeneous, if, the, entire, article, is, allowed, to, count, as, a, sample, of, it, on, a, fine, enough, scale, any, mixture, can, be, said, to, be, heterogeneous, because, a, sample, could, be, as, small, as, a, single, molecule, in, practical, terms, if, the, property, of, interest, of, the, mixture, is, the, same, regardless, of, which, sample, of, it, is, taken, for, the, examination, used, the, mixture, is, homogeneous, gy, s, sampling, theory, quantitatively, defines, the, heterogeneity, of, a, particle, as, where, h, i, displaystyle, h, i, c, i, displaystyle, c, i, c, batch, displaystyle, c, text, batch, m, i, displaystyle, m, i, and, m, aver, displaystyle, m, text, aver, are, respectively, the, heterogeneity, of, the, i, displaystyle, i, th, particle, of, the, population, the, mass, concentration, of, the, property, of, interest, in, the, i, displaystyle, i, th, particle, of, the, population, the, mass, concentration, of, the, property, of, interest, in, the, population, the, mass, of, the, i, displaystyle, i, th, particle, in, the, population, and, the, average, mass, of, a, particle, in, the, population, during, sampling, of, heterogeneous, mixtures, of, particles, the, variance, of, the, sampling, error, is, generally, non, zero, pierre, gy, derived, from, the, poisson, sampling, model, the, following, formula, for, the, variance, of, the, sampling, error, in, the, mass, concentration, in, a, sample, in, which, v, is, the, variance, of, the, sampling, error, n, is, the, number, of, particles, in, the, population, before, the, sample, was, taken, q, i, is, the, probability, of, including, the, i, th, particle, of, the, population, in, the, sample, i, e, the, first, order, inclusion, probability, of, the, i, th, particle, m, i, is, the, mass, of, the, i, th, particle, of, the, population, and, a, i, is, the, mass, concentration, of, the, property, of, interest, in, the, i, th, particle, of, the, population, the, above, equation, for, the, variance, of, the, sampling, error, is, an, approximation, based, on, a, linearization, of, the, mass, concentration, in, a, sample, in, the, theory, of, gy, correct, sampling, is, defined, as, a, sampling, scenario, in, which, all, particles, have, the, same, probability, of, being, included, in, the, sample, this, implies, that, q, i, no, longer, depends, on, i, and, can, therefore, be, replaced, by, the, symbol, q, gy, s, equation, for, the, variance, of, the, sampling, error, becomes, where, a, batch, is, that, concentration, of, the, property, of, interest, in, the, population, from, which, the, sample, is, to, be, drawn, and, m, batch, is, the, mass, of, the, population, from, which, the, sample, is, to, be, drawn, air, pollution, research, show, biological, and, health, effects, after, exposure, to, mixtures, are, more, potent, than, effects, from, exposures, of, individual, components
