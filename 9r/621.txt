land, also, known, as, dry, land, ground, or, earth, is, the, solid, terrestrial, surface, of, earth, not, submerged, by, the, ocean, or, another, body, of, water, it, makes, up, 29, 2, of, earth, s, surface, and, includes, all, continents, and, islands, earth, s, land, surface, is, almost, entirely, covered, by, regolith, a, layer, of, rock, soil, and, minerals, that, forms, the, outer, part, of, the, crust, land, plays, an, important, role, in, earth, s, climate, system, being, involved, in, the, carbon, cycle, nitrogen, cycle, and, water, cycle, one, third, of, land, is, covered, in, trees, another, third, is, used, for, agriculture, and, one, tenth, is, covered, in, permanent, snow, and, glaciers, the, remainder, consists, of, desert, savannah, and, prairie, land, terrain, varies, greatly, consisting, of, mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, glaciers, and, other, landforms, in, physical, geology, the, land, is, divided, into, two, major, categories, mountain, ranges, and, relatively, flat, interiors, called, cratons, both, form, over, millions, of, years, through, plate, tectonics, streams, a, major, part, of, earth, s, water, cycle, shape, the, landscape, carve, rocks, transport, sediments, and, replenish, groundwater, at, high, elevations, or, latitudes, snow, is, compacted, and, recrystallized, over, hundreds, or, thousands, of, years, to, form, glaciers, which, can, be, so, heavy, that, they, warp, the, earth, s, crust, about, 30, percent, of, land, has, a, dry, climate, due, to, losing, more, water, through, evaporation, than, it, gains, from, precipitation, since, warm, air, rises, this, generates, winds, though, earth, s, rotation, and, uneven, sun, distribution, also, play, a, part, land, is, commonly, defined, as, the, solid, dry, surface, of, earth, it, can, also, refer, to, the, collective, natural, resources, that, the, land, holds, including, rivers, lakes, and, the, biosphere, human, manipulation, of, the, land, including, agriculture, and, architecture, can, also, be, considered, part, of, land, land, is, formed, from, the, continental, crust, the, layer, of, rock, on, which, soil, groundwater, and, human, and, animal, activity, sits, though, modern, terrestrial, plants, and, animals, evolved, from, aquatic, creatures, earth, s, first, cellular, life, likely, originated, on, land, survival, on, land, relies, on, fresh, water, from, rivers, streams, lakes, and, glaciers, which, constitute, only, three, percent, of, the, water, on, earth, the, vast, majority, of, human, activity, throughout, history, has, occurred, in, habitable, land, areas, supporting, agriculture, and, various, natural, resources, in, recent, decades, scientists, and, policymakers, have, emphasized, the, need, to, manage, land, and, its, biosphere, more, sustainably, through, measures, such, as, restoring, degraded, soil, preserving, biodiversity, protecting, endangered, species, and, addressing, climate, change, land, is, often, defined, as, the, solid, dry, surface, of, earth, the, word, land, may, also, collectively, refer, the, collective, natural, resources, of, earth, including, its, land, cover, rivers, shallow, lakes, its, biosphere, the, lowest, layer, of, the, atmosphere, troposphere, groundwater, reserves, and, the, physical, results, of, human, activity, on, land, such, as, architecture, and, agriculture, the, boundary, between, land, and, sea, is, called, the, shoreline, 625, the, word, land, is, derived, from, old, english, from, the, proto, germanic, word, land, untilled, land, and, then, the, proto, indo, european, lend, especially, in, northern, regions, that, were, home, to, languages, like, proto, celtic, and, proto, slavic, examples, include, old, irish, land, land, plot, church, building, and, old, irish, ithlann, threshing, floor, and, old, east, slavic, ljadina, wasteland, weeds, a, country, or, nation, may, be, referred, to, as, the, motherland, fatherland, or, homeland, of, its, people, 43, many, countries, and, other, places, have, names, incorporating, the, suffix, land, e, g, england, greenland, and, new, zealand, the, equivalent, suffix, stan, from, indo, iranian, ultimately, derived, from, the, proto, indo, iranian, sth, na, is, also, present, in, many, country, and, location, names, such, as, pakistan, afghanistan, and, others, throughout, central, asia, the, suffix, is, also, used, more, generally, as, in, persian, rigest, n, place, of, sand, desert, golest, n, place, of, flowers, garden, gurest, n, graveyard, cemetery, and, hindust, n, land, of, the, indo, people, the, study, of, land, and, its, history, in, general, is, called, geography, mineralogy, is, the, study, of, minerals, and, petrology, is, the, study, of, rocks, soil, science, is, the, study, of, soils, encompassing, the, sub, disciplines, of, pedology, which, focuses, on, soil, formation, and, edaphology, which, focuses, on, the, relationship, between, soil, and, life, the, earliest, material, found, in, the, solar, system, is, dated, to, 4, 5672, 0, 0006, bya, billion, years, ago, therefore, the, earth, itself, must, have, been, formed, by, accretion, around, this, time, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, solar, system, bodies, occurred, in, tandem, with, the, sun, in, theory, a, solar, nebula, partitions, a, volume, out, of, a, molecular, cloud, by, gravitational, collapse, which, begins, to, spin, and, flatten, into, a, circumstellar, disc, out, of, which, the, planets, then, grow, in, tandem, with, the, star, a, nebula, contains, gas, ice, grains, and, dust, including, primordial, nuclides, in, nebular, theory, planetesimals, begin, to, form, as, particulate, matter, accumulates, by, cohesive, clumping, and, then, by, gravity, the, primordial, earth, s, assembly, took, 10, 20, myr, by, 4, 54, 0, 04, bya, the, primordial, earth, had, formed, earth, s, atmosphere, and, oceans, were, formed, by, volcanic, activity, and, outgassing, that, included, water, vapour, the, origin, of, the, world, s, oceans, was, condensation, augmented, by, water, and, ice, delivered, by, asteroids, protoplanets, and, comets, in, this, model, atmospheric, greenhouse, gases, kept, the, oceans, from, freezing, while, the, newly, formed, sun, was, only, at, 70, luminosity, by, 3, 5, bya, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, was, established, which, helped, prevent, the, atmosphere, from, being, stripped, away, by, the, solar, wind, the, atmosphere, and, oceans, of, the, earth, continuously, shape, the, land, by, eroding, and, transporting, solids, on, the, surface, earth, s, crust, formed, when, the, molten, outer, layer, of, the, planet, earth, cooled, to, form, a, solid, mass, as, the, accumulated, water, vapour, began, to, act, in, the, atmosphere, once, land, became, capable, of, supporting, life, biodiversity, evolved, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, expanding, continually, except, when, punctuated, by, mass, extinctions, the, two, models, that, explain, land, mass, propose, either, a, steady, growth, to, the, present, day, forms, or, more, likely, a, rapid, growth, early, in, earth, history, followed, by, a, long, term, steady, continental, area, continents, are, formed, by, plate, tectonics, a, process, ultimately, driven, by, the, continuous, loss, of, heat, from, the, earth, s, interior, on, time, scales, lasting, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, the, supercontinents, have, formed, and, broken, apart, three, times, roughly, 750, mya, million, years, ago, one, of, the, earliest, known, supercontinents, rodinia, began, to, break, apart, the, continents, later, recombined, to, form, pannotia, 600, 540, mya, then, finally, pangaea, which, also, broke, apart, 180, mya, a, continuous, area, of, land, surrounded, by, an, ocean, is, called, a, landmass, although, it, is, most, often, written, as, one, word, to, distinguish, it, from, the, usage, land, mass, the, measure, of, land, area, it, may, also, be, written, as, two, words, there, are, four, major, continuous, landmasses, on, earth, afro, eurasia, america, landmass, antarctica, and, australia, landmass, which, are, subdivided, into, continents, up, to, seven, geographical, regions, are, commonly, regarded, as, continents, ordered, from, greatest, to, least, land, area, these, continents, are, asia, africa, north, america, south, america, antarctica, europe, and, australia, terrain, refers, to, an, area, of, land, and, its, features, terrain, affects, travel, mapmaking, ecosystems, and, surface, water, flow, and, distribution, over, a, large, area, it, can, influence, climate, and, weather, patterns, the, terrain, of, a, region, largely, determines, its, suitability, for, human, settlement, flatter, alluvial, plains, tend, to, have, better, farming, soils, than, steeper, rockier, uplands, elevation, is, defined, as, the, vertical, distance, between, an, object, and, sea, level, while, altitude, is, defined, as, the, vertical, distance, from, an, object, to, earth, s, surface, the, elevation, of, earth, s, land, surface, varies, from, the, low, point, of, 418, m, 1, 371, ft, at, the, dead, sea, to, a, maximum, altitude, of, 8, 848, m, 29, 029, ft, at, the, top, of, mount, everest, the, mean, height, of, land, above, sea, level, is, about, 797, m, 2, 615, ft, with, 98, 9, of, dry, land, situated, above, sea, level, relief, refers, to, the, difference, in, elevation, within, a, landscape, for, example, flat, terrain, would, have, low, relief, while, terrain, with, a, large, elevation, difference, between, the, highest, and, lowest, points, would, be, deemed, high, relief, most, land, has, relatively, low, relief, the, change, in, elevation, between, two, points, of, the, terrain, is, called, a, slope, or, gradient, a, topographic, map, is, a, form, of, terrain, cartography, which, depicts, terrain, in, terms, of, its, elevation, slope, and, the, orientation, of, its, landforms, it, has, prominent, contour, lines, which, connect, points, of, similar, elevation, while, perpendicular, slope, lines, point, in, the, direction, of, the, steepest, slope, hypsometric, tints, are, colors, placed, between, contour, lines, to, indicate, elevation, relative, to, sea, level, a, difference, between, uplands, or, highlands, and, lowlands, is, drawn, in, several, earth, science, fields, in, river, ecology, upland, rivers, are, fast, moving, and, colder, than, lowland, rivers, encouraging, different, species, of, fish, and, other, aquatic, wildlife, to, live, in, these, habitats, for, example, nutrients, are, more, present, in, slow, moving, lowland, rivers, encouraging, different, species, of, macrophytes, to, grow, there, the, term, upland, is, also, used, in, wetland, ecology, where, upland, plants, indicate, an, area, that, is, not, a, wetland, in, addition, the, term, moorland, refers, to, upland, shrubland, biomes, with, acidic, soils, while, heathlands, are, lowland, shrublands, with, acidic, soils, geomorphology, refers, to, the, study, of, the, natural, processes, that, shape, land, s, surface, creating, landforms, 3, erosion, and, tectonics, volcanic, eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the, growth, of, coral, reefs, and, meteorite, impacts, are, among, the, processes, that, constantly, reshape, earth, s, surface, over, geological, time, erosion, transports, one, part, of, land, to, another, via, natural, processes, such, as, wind, water, ice, and, gravity, in, contrast, weathering, wears, away, rock, and, other, solid, land, without, transporting, the, land, somewhere, else, 210, 211, natural, erosional, processes, usually, take, a, long, time, to, cause, noticeable, changes, in, the, landscape, for, example, the, grand, canyon, was, created, over, the, past, 70, million, years, by, the, colorado, river, which, scientists, estimate, continues, to, erode, the, canyon, at, a, rate, of, 0, 3, meters, 1, foot, every, 200, years, however, humans, have, caused, erosion, to, be, 10, 40, times, faster, than, normal, causing, half, the, topsoil, of, the, surface, of, earth, s, land, to, be, lost, within, the, past, 150, years, plate, tectonics, refers, to, the, theory, that, earth, s, lithosphere, is, divided, into, tectonic, plates, that, move, over, the, mantle, 66, this, results, in, continental, drift, with, continents, moving, relative, to, each, other, the, scientist, alfred, wegener, first, hypothesized, the, theory, of, continental, drift, in, 1912, more, researchers, gradually, developed, his, idea, throughout, the, 20th, century, into, the, widely, accepted, theory, of, plate, tectonics, of, today, several, key, characteristics, define, modern, understanding, of, plate, tectonics, the, place, where, two, tectonic, plates, meet, is, called, a, plate, boundary, with, different, geological, phenomena, occurring, across, different, kinds, of, boundaries, for, example, at, divergent, plate, boundaries, seafloor, spreading, is, usually, seen, 74, 75, in, contrast, with, the, subduction, zones, of, convergent, or, transform, plate, boundaries, 78, 80, earthquakes, and, volcanic, activity, are, common, in, all, types, of, boundaries, volcanic, activity, refers, to, any, rupture, in, earth, s, surface, where, magma, escapes, therefore, becoming, lava, 170, 172, the, ring, of, fire, containing, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, volcanos, and, over, 70, of, earth, s, seismological, activity, comprises, plate, boundaries, surrounding, the, pacific, ocean, 68, 409, 452, earth, s, land, interacts, with, and, influences, its, climate, heavily, since, the, land, s, surface, heats, up, and, cools, down, faster, than, air, or, water, latitude, elevation, topography, reflectivity, and, land, use, all, have, varying, effects, on, climate, the, latitude, of, the, land, will, influence, how, much, solar, radiation, reaches, its, surface, high, latitudes, receive, less, solar, radiation, than, low, latitudes, the, land, s, topography, is, important, in, creating, and, transforming, airflow, and, precipitation, large, landforms, such, as, mountain, ranges, can, divert, wind, energy, and, make, air, parcels, less, dense, and, therefore, able, to, hold, less, heat, as, air, rises, this, cooling, effect, causes, condensation, and, precipitation, different, types, of, land, cover, will, influence, the, land, s, albedo, a, measure, of, the, solar, radiation, that, is, reflected, rather, than, absorbed, and, transferred, to, earth, vegetation, has, a, relatively, low, albedo, meaning, that, vegetated, surfaces, are, good, absorbers, of, the, sun, s, energy, forests, have, an, albedo, of, 10, 15, percent, while, grasslands, have, an, albedo, of, 15, 20, percent, in, comparison, sandy, deserts, have, an, albedo, of, 25, 40, percent, land, use, by, humans, also, plays, a, role, in, the, regional, and, global, climate, densely, populated, cities, are, warmer, and, create, urban, heat, islands, that, have, effects, on, the, precipitation, cloud, cover, and, temperature, of, the, region, a, landform, is, a, natural, or, manmade, land, feature, landforms, together, make, up, a, given, terrain, and, their, arrangement, in, the, landscape, is, known, as, topography, landforms, include, hills, mountains, canyons, and, valleys, as, well, as, shoreline, features, such, as, bays, capes, and, peninsulas, the, shoreline, is, the, interface, between, the, land, and, the, ocean, it, migrates, each, day, as, tides, rise, and, fall, and, moves, over, long, periods, of, time, as, sea, levels, change, the, shore, extends, from, the, low, tide, line, to, the, highest, elevation, that, can, be, reached, by, storm, waves, and, the, coast, stretches, out, inland, until, the, point, where, ocean, related, features, are, no, longer, found, 625, 626, when, land, is, in, contact, with, bodies, of, water, the, land, is, likely, weathered, and, eroded, the, weathering, of, a, coastline, may, be, impacted, by, the, tides, caused, by, changes, in, gravitational, forces, on, larger, bodies, of, water, 352, 353, the, precise, length, of, earth, s, coastline, is, indeterminable, due, to, the, coastline, paradox, according, to, the, world, factbook, the, coastline, is, around, 356, 000, kilometres, 221, 000, mi, while, according, to, the, world, resources, institute, it, is, 1, 634, 701, kilometres, 1, 015, 756, mi, coasts, are, important, zones, in, natural, ecosystems, often, home, to, a, wide, range, of, biodiversity, on, land, they, harbour, important, ecosystems, such, as, freshwater, or, estuarine, wetlands, which, are, important, for, bird, populations, and, other, terrestrial, animals, in, wave, protected, areas, they, harbor, saltmarshes, mangroves, or, seagrasses, all, of, which, can, provide, nursery, habitat, for, finfish, shellfish, and, other, aquatic, species, rocky, shores, are, usually, found, along, exposed, coasts, and, provide, habitat, for, a, wide, range, of, sessile, animals, e, g, mussels, starfish, barnacles, and, various, kinds, of, seaweeds, along, tropical, coasts, with, clear, nutrient, poor, water, coral, reefs, can, often, be, found, between, depths, of, 1, 50, meters, 3, 3, 164, 0, feet, according, to, a, united, nations, atlas, 44, of, all, people, live, within, 150, km, 93, mi, of, the, sea, because, of, their, importance, in, society, and, high, concentration, of, population, the, coast, is, important, for, major, parts, of, the, global, food, and, economic, system, and, they, provide, many, ecosystem, services, to, humankind, for, example, important, human, activities, happen, in, port, cities, coastal, fisheries, commercial, recreational, and, subsistence, and, aquaculture, are, major, economic, activities, and, create, jobs, livelihoods, and, protein, for, the, majority, of, coastal, human, populations, other, coastal, spaces, like, beaches, and, seaside, resorts, generate, large, revenues, through, tourism, marine, coastal, ecosystems, can, also, provide, protection, against, sea, level, rise, and, tsunamis, in, many, countries, mangroves, are, the, primary, source, of, wood, for, fuel, e, g, charcoal, and, building, material, coastal, ecosystems, like, mangroves, and, seagrasses, have, a, much, higher, capacity, for, carbon, sequestration, than, many, terrestrial, ecosystems, and, as, such, can, play, a, critical, role, in, the, near, future, to, help, mitigate, climate, change, effects, by, uptake, of, atmospheric, anthropogenic, carbon, dioxide, an, isolated, land, habitat, surrounded, by, water, is, an, island, xxxi, while, a, chain, of, islands, is, an, archipelago, the, smaller, the, island, the, larger, the, percentage, of, its, land, area, will, be, adjacent, to, the, water, and, subsequently, will, be, coast, or, beach, islands, can, be, formed, by, a, variety, of, processes, the, hawaiian, islands, for, example, even, though, they, are, not, near, a, plate, boundary, formed, from, isolated, volcanic, activity, 406, atolls, are, ring, shaped, islands, made, of, coral, created, when, subsidence, causes, an, island, to, sink, beneath, the, ocean, surface, and, leaves, a, ring, of, reefs, around, it, 69, mountains, are, features, that, usually, rise, at, least, 300, metres, 980, ft, higher, than, the, surrounding, terrain, the, formation, of, mountain, belts, is, called, orogenesis, and, results, from, plate, tectonics, 448, 449, for, example, where, a, plate, at, a, convergent, plate, boundary, pushes, one, plate, above, the, other, mountains, could, be, formed, by, either, collisional, events, such, that, earth, s, crust, is, pushed, upwards, 454, 460, or, subductional, events, where, earth, s, crust, is, pushed, into, the, mantle, causing, the, crust, to, melt, rise, due, to, its, low, density, and, solidify, into, hardened, rock, thickening, the, crust, 449, 453, a, plateau, also, called, a, high, plain, or, a, tableland, is, an, area, of, a, highland, consisting, of, flat, terrain, that, is, raised, sharply, above, the, surrounding, area, on, at, least, one, side, creating, steep, cliffs, or, escarpments, 99, both, volcanic, activity, such, as, the, upwelling, of, magma, and, extrusion, of, lava, or, erosion, of, mountains, caused, from, water, glaciers, or, aeolian, processes, can, create, plateaus, plateaus, are, classified, according, to, their, surrounding, environment, as, intermontane, piedmont, or, continental, a, few, plateaus, may, have, a, small, flat, top, while, others, have, wide, ones, buttes, are, smaller, ones, with, less, extrusive, and, more, intrusive, igneous, rock, while, plateaus, or, highlands, are, the, widest, and, mesas, are, a, general, sized, plateau, with, horizontal, bedrock, strata, wide, flat, areas, of, land, are, called, plains, which, cover, more, than, one, third, of, earth, s, land, area, when, they, occur, as, lowered, areas, between, mountains, they, can, create, valleys, canyons, or, gorges, and, ravines, a, plateau, can, be, thought, of, as, an, elevated, plain, plains, are, known, to, have, fertile, soils, and, be, important, for, agriculture, due, to, their, flatness, supporting, grasses, suitable, for, livestock, and, facilitating, the, harvest, of, crops, floodplains, provided, agricultural, land, for, some, of, the, earliest, civilizations, erosion, is, often, a, main, driver, for, the, creation, of, plains, and, valleys, with, rift, valleys, being, a, noticeable, exception, fjords, are, glacial, valleys, that, can, be, thousands, of, meters, deep, opening, out, to, the, sea, any, natural, void, in, the, ground, which, can, be, entered, by, a, human, can, be, considered, a, cave, they, have, been, important, to, humans, as, a, place, of, shelter, since, the, dawn, of, humanity, craters, are, depressions, in, the, ground, but, unlike, caves, they, do, not, provide, shelter, or, extend, underground, there, are, many, kinds, of, craters, such, as, impact, craters, volcanic, calderas, and, isostatic, depressions, such, as, the, one, in, greenland, karst, processes, can, create, both, solution, caves, the, most, frequent, cave, type, and, craters, as, seen, in, karst, sinkholes, the, pedosphere, is, the, outermost, layer, of, earth, s, continental, surface, and, is, composed, of, soil, and, subject, to, soil, formation, processes, below, it, the, lithosphere, encompasses, both, earth, s, crust, and, the, uppermost, layer, of, the, mantle, the, lithosphere, rests, or, floats, on, top, of, the, mantle, below, it, via, isostasy, 463, above, the, solid, ground, the, troposphere, and, humans, use, of, land, can, be, considered, layers, of, the, land, land, cover, refers, to, the, material, physically, present, on, the, land, surface, for, example, woody, crops, herbaceous, crops, barren, land, and, shrub, covered, areas, artificial, surfaces, including, cities, account, for, about, a, third, of, a, percent, of, all, land, land, use, refers, to, human, allocation, of, land, for, various, purposes, including, farming, ranching, and, recreation, e, g, national, parks, worldwide, there, are, an, estimated, 16, 7, million, km, 2, 6, 4, million, sq, mi, of, cropland, and, 33, 5, million,

impacts, on, habitats, and, biodiversity, as, well, as, natural, resources, in, the, target, areas, land, cover, change, detection, and, mapping, is, a, key, component, of, interdisciplinary, land, change, science, which, uses, it, to, determine, the, consequences, of, land, change, on, climate, land, change, modeling, is, used, to, predict, and, analyze, changes, in, land, cover, and, use, soil, is, a, mixture, of, organic, matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and, organisms, that, together, support, life, soil, consists, of, a, solid, phase, of, minerals, and, organic, matter, the, soil, matrix, 222, as, well, as, a, porous, phase, that, holds, gases, the, soil, atmosphere, and, water, the, soil, solution, accordingly, soil, is, a, three, state, system, of, solids, liquids, and, gases, soil, is, a, product, of, several, factors, the, influence, of, climate, relief, elevation, orientation, and, slope, of, terrain, organisms, and, the, soil, s, parent, materials, original, minerals, interacting, over, time, it, continually, undergoes, development, by, way, of, numerous, physical, chemical, and, biological, processes, which, include, weathering, and, erosion, 148, 150, given, its, complexity, and, strong, internal, connectedness, soil, ecologists, regard, soil, as, an, ecosystem, soil, acts, as, an, engineering, medium, a, habitat, for, soil, organisms, a, recycling, system, for, nutrients, and, organic, wastes, a, regulator, of, water, quality, a, modifier, of, atmospheric, composition, and, a, medium, for, plant, growth, making, it, a, critically, important, provider, of, ecosystem, services, since, soil, has, a, tremendous, range, of, available, niches, and, habitats, it, contains, a, prominent, part, of, the, earth, s, genetic, diversity, a, gram, of, soil, can, contain, billions, of, organisms, belonging, to, thousands, of, species, mostly, microbial, and, largely, still, unexplored, soil, is, a, major, component, of, the, earth, s, ecosystem, the, world, s, ecosystems, are, impacted, in, far, reaching, ways, by, the, processes, carried, out, in, the, soil, with, effects, ranging, from, ozone, depletion, and, global, warming, to, rainforest, destruction, and, water, pollution, with, respect, to, earth, s, carbon, cycle, soil, acts, as, an, important, carbon, reservoir, and, it, is, potentially, one, of, the, most, reactive, to, human, disturbance, and, climate, change, as, the, planet, warms, it, has, been, predicted, that, soils, will, add, carbon, dioxide, to, the, atmosphere, due, to, increased, biological, activity, at, higher, temperatures, a, positive, feedback, amplification, this, prediction, has, however, been, questioned, on, consideration, of, more, recent, knowledge, on, soil, carbon, turnover, continental, crust, is, the, layer, of, igneous, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rocks, that, forms, the, geological, continents, and, the, areas, of, shallow, seabed, close, to, their, shores, known, as, continental, shelves, this, layer, is, sometimes, called, sial, because, its, bulk, composition, is, richer, in, aluminium, silicate, and, has, a, lower, density, compared, to, the, oceanic, crust, called, sima, which, is, richer, in, magnesium, silicate, changes, in, seismic, wave, velocities, have, shown, that, at, a, certain, depth, the, conrad, discontinuity, there, is, a, reasonably, sharp, contrast, between, the, more, felsic, upper, continental, crust, and, the, lower, continental, crust, which, is, more, mafic, in, character, the, composition, of, land, is, not, uniform, across, the, earth, varying, between, locations, and, between, strata, within, the, same, location, the, most, prominent, components, of, upper, continental, crust, include, silicon, dioxide, aluminium, oxide, and, magnesium, the, continental, crust, consists, of, lower, density, material, such, as, the, igneous, rocks, granite, and, andesite, less, common, is, basalt, a, denser, volcanic, rock, that, is, the, primary, constituent, of, the, ocean, floors, sedimentary, rock, is, formed, from, the, accumulation, of, sediment, that, becomes, buried, and, compacted, together, nearly, 75, of, the, continental, surfaces, are, covered, by, sedimentary, rocks, although, they, form, about, 5, of, the, crust, the, most, abundant, silicate, minerals, on, earth, s, surface, include, quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene, and, olivine, common, carbonate, minerals, include, calcite, found, in, limestone, and, dolomite, the, rock, that, makes, up, land, is, thicker, than, oceanic, crust, and, it, is, far, more, varied, in, terms, of, composition, about, 31, of, this, continental, crust, is, submerged, in, shallow, water, forming, continental, shelves, land, provides, many, ecosystem, services, such, as, mitigating, climate, change, regulating, water, supply, through, drainage, basins, and, river, systems, and, supporting, food, production, land, resources, are, finite, which, has, led, to, regulations, intended, to, safeguard, these, ecosystem, services, and, a, set, of, practices, called, sustainable, land, management, a, biome, is, an, area, characterized, by, its, vegetation, soil, climate, and, wildlife, there, are, five, major, types, of, biomes, on, land, grasslands, forests, deserts, tundras, and, freshwater, other, types, of, biomes, include, shrublands, wetlands, and, polar, ice, caps, an, ecosystem, refers, to, the, interaction, between, organisms, within, a, particular, environment, and, a, habitat, refers, to, the, environment, where, a, given, species, or, population, of, organisms, lives, biomes, may, span, more, than, one, continent, and, contain, a, variety, of, ecosystems, and, habitats, land, plants, evolved, from, green, algae, and, are, called, embryophytes, they, include, trees, shrubs, ferns, grass, moss, and, flowers, most, plants, are, vascular, plants, meaning, that, their, tissues, distribute, water, and, minerals, throughout, the, plant, through, photosynthesis, most, plants, nourish, themselves, from, sunlight, and, water, breathing, in, carbon, dioxide, and, breathing, out, oxygen, between, 20, and, 50, of, oxygen, is, produced, by, land, vegetation, unlike, plants, terrestrial, animals, are, not, a, monophyletic, group, that, is, a, group, including, all, terrestrial, animals, does, not, encompass, all, lineages, from, a, common, ancestor, this, is, because, there, are, organisms, such, as, the, whale, that, evolved, from, terrestrial, mammals, back, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, many, megafauna, of, the, past, such, as, non, avian, dinosaurs, have, become, extinct, due, to, extinction, events, e, g, the, quaternary, extinction, event, land, is, deeply, intertwined, with, human, development, 21, it, is, a, crucial, resource, for, human, survival, humans, depend, on, land, for, subsistence, and, can, develop, strong, symbolic, attachments, to, it, access, to, land, can, determine, survival, and, wealth, particularly, in, developing, countries, giving, rise, to, complex, power, relationships, in, production, and, consumption, most, of, the, world, s, philosophies, and, religions, recognize, a, human, duty, of, stewardship, towards, land, and, nature, many, humans, see, land, as, a, source, of, spirituality, inspiration, and, beauty, many, also, derive, a, sense, of, belonging, from, land, especially, if, it, also, belonged, to, their, ancestors, various, religions, teach, about, a, connection, between, humans, and, the, land, such, as, veneration, of, bhumi, a, personification, of, the, earth, in, hinduism, and, the, obligation, to, protect, land, as, hima, in, islam, and, in, almost, every, indigenous, group, there, are, etiological, stories, about, the, land, they, live, on, for, indigenous, peoples, connection, to, the, land, is, an, important, part, of, their, identity, and, culture, and, some, religious, groups, consider, a, particular, area, of, land, to, be, sacred, such, as, the, holy, land, in, the, abrahamic, religions, creation, myths, in, many, religions, involve, stories, of, the, creation, of, the, world, by, a, supernatural, deity, or, deities, including, accounts, wherein, the, land, is, separated, from, the, oceans, and, the, air, the, earth, itself, has, often, been, personified, as, a, deity, in, particular, a, goddess, in, many, cultures, the, mother, goddess, is, also, portrayed, as, a, fertility, deity, to, the, aztecs, earth, was, called, tonantzin, our, mother, to, the, incas, earth, was, called, pachamama, mother, earth, the, chinese, earth, goddess, hou, tu, is, similar, to, gaia, the, greek, goddess, personifying, the, earth, in, norse, mythology, the, earth, giantess, j, r, was, the, mother, of, thor, and, the, daughter, of, annar, ancient, egyptian, mythology, is, different, from, that, of, other, cultures, because, earth, geb, is, male, and, the, sky, nut, is, female, ancient, near, eastern, cultures, conceived, of, the, world, as, a, flat, disk, of, land, surrounded, by, ocean, the, pyramid, texts, and, coffin, texts, reveal, that, the, ancient, egyptians, believed, nun, the, ocean, was, a, circular, body, surrounding, nbwt, a, term, meaning, dry, lands, or, islands, the, hebrew, bible, drawing, on, other, near, eastern, ideas, depicts, the, earth, as, a, flat, disc, floating, on, water, with, another, expanse, of, water, above, it, a, similar, model, is, found, in, the, homeric, account, of, the, 8th, century, bc, in, which, okeanos, the, personified, body, of, water, surrounding, the, circular, surface, of, the, earth, is, the, begetter, of, all, life, and, possibly, of, all, gods, the, spherical, form, of, the, earth, was, suggested, by, early, greek, philosophers, a, belief, espoused, by, pythagoras, contrary, to, popular, belief, most, educated, people, in, the, middle, ages, did, not, believe, the, earth, was, flat, this, misconception, is, often, called, the, myth, of, the, flat, earth, as, evidenced, by, thinkers, such, as, thomas, aquinas, the, european, belief, in, a, spherical, earth, was, widespread, by, this, point, in, time, prior, to, circumnavigation, of, the, planet, and, the, introduction, of, space, flight, belief, in, a, spherical, earth, was, based, on, observations, of, the, secondary, effects, of, the, earth, s, shape, and, parallels, drawn, with, the, shape, of, other, planets, humans, have, commonly, traveled, for, business, pleasure, discovery, and, adventure, all, made, easier, in, recent, human, history, as, a, result, of, technologies, like, cars, trains, planes, and, ships, land, navigation, is, an, aspect, of, travel, and, refers, to, progressing, through, unfamiliar, terrain, using, navigational, tools, like, maps, with, references, to, terrain, a, compass, or, satellite, navigation, navigation, on, land, is, often, facilitated, by, reference, to, landmarks, enduring, and, recognizable, natural, or, artificial, features, that, stand, out, from, their, nearby, environment, and, are, often, visible, from, long, distances, natural, landmarks, can, be, characteristic, features, such, as, mountains, or, plateaus, with, examples, including, table, mountain, in, south, africa, mount, ararat, in, turkey, the, grand, canyon, in, the, united, states, uluru, in, australia, and, mount, fuji, in, japan, two, major, eras, of, exploration, occurred, in, human, history, one, of, divergence, and, one, of, convergence, the, former, saw, humans, moving, out, of, africa, settling, in, new, lands, and, developing, distinct, cultures, in, relative, isolation, early, explorers, settled, in, europe, and, asia, 14, 000, years, ago, some, crossed, the, ice, age, land, bridge, from, siberia, to, alaska, and, moved, southbound, to, settle, in, the, americas, for, the, most, part, these, cultures, were, ignorant, of, each, other, s, existence, the, second, period, occurring, over, roughly, the, last, 10, 000, years, saw, increased, cross, cultural, exchange, through, trade, and, exploration, marking, a, new, era, of, cultural, intermingling, human, trade, has, occurred, since, the, prehistoric, era, peter, watson, dates, the, history, of, long, distance, commerce, from, c, 150, 000, years, ago, major, trade, routes, throughout, history, have, existed, on, land, such, as, the, silk, road, which, linked, east, asia, with, europe, and, the, amber, road, which, was, used, to, transfer, amber, from, northern, europe, to, the, mediterranean, sea, the, dark, ages, led, trade, to, collapse, in, the, west, but, it, continued, to, flourish, among, the, kingdoms, of, africa, the, middle, east, india, china, and, southeast, asia, during, the, middle, ages, central, asia, was, the, economic, centre, of, the, world, and, luxury, goods, were, commonly, traded, in, europe, physical, money, either, barter, or, precious, metals, was, dangerous, to, carry, over, a, long, distance, to, address, this, a, burgeoning, banking, industry, enabled, the, shift, to, movable, wealth, or, capital, making, it, far, easier, and, safer, to, trade, across, long, distances, after, the, age, of, sail, international, trade, mostly, occurred, along, sea, routes, notably, to, prevent, intermediary, countries, from, being, able, to, control, trade, routes, and, the, flow, of, goods, in, economics, land, refers, to, a, factor, of, production, it, can, be, leased, in, exchange, for, rent, and, use, of, its, various, raw, material, resources, trees, oil, metals, for, more, than, 10, 000, years, humans, have, engaged, in, activities, on, land, such, as, hunting, foraging, controlled, burning, land, clearing, and, agriculture, beginning, with, the, neolithic, revolution, and, the, spread, of, agriculture, around, the, world, human, land, use, has, significantly, altered, terrestrial, ecosystems, with, an, essentially, global, transformation, of, earth, s, landscape, by, 3000, years, ago, 30, from, around, 1750, human, land, use, has, increased, at, an, accelerating, rate, due, to, the, industrial, revolution, which, created, a, greater, demand, for, natural, resources, and, caused, rapid, population, growth, 34, agriculture, includes, both, crop, farming, and, animal, husbandry, a, third, of, earth, s, land, surface, is, used, for, agriculture, 126, with, estimated, 16, 7, million, km, 2, 6, 4, million, sq, mi, of, cropland, and, 33, 5, million, km, 2, 12, 9, million, sq, mi, of, pastureland, this, has, had, significant, impacts, on, earth, s, ecosystems, when, land, is, cleared, to, make, way, for, agriculture, native, flora, and, fauna, are, replaced, with, newly, introduced, crops, and, livestock, 31, excessively, high, agricultural, land, use, is, driven, by, poor, management, practices, which, lead, to, lower, food, yields, necessitating, more, land, use, food, demand, food, waste, and, diets, high, in, meat, 126, urbanization, has, led, to, greater, population, growth, in, urban, areas, in, the, last, century, although, urban, areas, make, up, less, than, 3, percent, of, earth, s, land, area, the, global, population, shifted, from, a, majority, living, in, rural, areas, to, a, majority, living, in, urban, areas, in, 2007, 35, people, living, in, urban, areas, depend, on, food, produced, in, rural, areas, outside, of, their, cities, which, creates, greater, demand, for, agriculture, and, drives, land, use, change, well, beyond, city, boundaries, 35, urbanization, also, displaces, agricultural, land, because, it, mainly, takes, place, on, the, most, fertile, land, urban, expansion, in, peri, urban, areas, fragments, agricultural, and, natural, lands, forcing, agriculture, to, move, to, less, fertile, land, elsewhere, because, this, land, is, less, fertile, more, land, is, needed, for, the, same, output, which, increases, the, total, agricultural, land, use, 119, another, form, of, land, use, is, mining, whereby, minerals, are, extracted, from, the, ground, using, a, variety, of, methods, evidence, of, mining, activity, dates, back, to, around, 3000, bce, in, ancient, egypt, 34, important, minerals, include, iron, ore, mined, for, use, as, a, raw, material, coal, mined, for, energy, production, and, gemstones, mined, for, use, in, jewellery, and, currency, 34, the, phrase, the, law, of, the, land, first, appeared, in, 1215, in, magna, carta, inspiring, its, later, usage, in, the, united, states, constitution, the, idea, of, common, land, also, originated, with, medieval, english, law, and, refers, collective, ownership, of, land, treating, it, as, a, common, good, in, environmental, science, economics, and, game, theory, the, tragedy, of, the, commons, refers, to, individuals, use, of, common, spaces, for, their, own, gain, deteriorating, the, land, overall, by, taking, more, than, their, fair, share, and, not, cooperating, with, others, the, idea, of, common, land, suggests, public, ownership, but, there, is, still, some, land, that, can, be, privatized, as, property, for, an, individual, such, as, a, landlord, or, king, in, the, developed, world, land, is, expected, to, be, privately, owned, by, an, individual, with, legal, title, but, in, the, developing, world, the, right, to, use, land, is, often, divided, with, the, rights, to, land, resources, being, given, to, different, people, at, different, times, for, the, same, area, of, land, beginning, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, international, community, has, begun, to, recognise, indigenous, land, rights, in, law, for, example, the, treaty, of, waitangi, for, m, ori, people, the, act, on, greenland, self, government, for, inuit, people, and, the, indigenous, peoples, rights, act, in, the, philippines, borders, are, geographical, boundaries, imposed, either, by, geographic, features, oceans, mountain, ranges, rivers, or, by, political, entities, governments, states, or, subnational, entities, political, borders, can, be, established, through, warfare, colonization, or, mutual, agreements, between, the, political, entities, that, reside, in, those, areas, the, creation, of, these, agreements, is, called, boundary, delimitation, many, wars, and, other, conflicts, have, occurred, in, efforts, by, participants, to, expand, the, land, under, their, control, or, to, assert, control, of, a, specific, area, of, considered, to, hold, strategic, historical, or, cultural, significance, the, mongol, empire, of, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, became, the, largest, contiguous, land, empire, in, history, through, war, and, conquest, in, the, 19th, century, united, states, a, concept, of, manifest, destiny, was, developed, by, various, groups, asserting, that, american, settlers, were, destined, to, expand, across, north, america, this, concept, was, used, to, justify, military, action, against, the, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, and, of, mexico, the, aggression, of, nazi, germany, in, world, war, ii, was, motivated, in, part, by, the, concept, of, lebensraum, living, space, which, had, first, became, a, geopolitical, goal, of, imperial, germany, in, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, originally, as, the, core, element, of, the, septemberprogramm, of, territorial, expansion, the, most, extreme, form, of, this, ideology, was, supported, by, the, nazi, party, nsdap, lebensraum, was, one, of, the, leading, motivations, nazi, germany, had, in, initiating, world, war, ii, and, it, would, continue, this, policy, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, land, degradation, is, the, reduction, or, loss, of, the, biological, or, economic, productivity, and, complexity, of, land, as, a, result, of, human, activity, 42, land, degradation, is, driven, by, many, different, activities, including, agriculture, urbanization, energy, production, and, mining, 43, humans, have, altered, more, than, three, quarters, of, ice, free, land, through, habitation, and, other, use, fundamentally, changing, ecosystems, human, activity, is, a, major, factor, in, the, holocene, extinction, and, human, caused, climate, change, is, causing, rising, sea, levels, and, ecosystem, loss, environmental, scientists, study, land, s, ecosystems, natural, resources, biosphere, fauna, and, flora, troposphere, and, the, impact, of, human, activity, on, these, their, recommendations, have, led, to, international, action, to, prevent, biodiversity, loss, and, desertification, and, encourage, sustainable, forest, and, waste, management, the, conservation, movement, lobbies, for, the, protection, of, endangered, species, and, the, protection, of, natural, areas, such, as, parks, 253, international, frameworks, have, focused, on, analyzing, how, humans, can, meet, their, needs, while, using, land, more, efficiently, and, preserving, its, natural, resources, notably, under, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goals, framework, human, land, use, can, cause, soil, to, degrade, both, in, quality, and, in, quantity, 44, soil, degradation, can, be, caused, by, agrochemicals, such, as, fertilizers, pesticides, and, herbicides, infrastructure, development, and, mining, among, other, activities, 43, 47, there, are, several, different, processes, that, lead, to, soil, degradation, physical, processes, such, as, erosion, sealing, and, crusting, lead, to, the, structural, breakdown, of, the, soil, this, means, water, cannot, penetrate, the, soil, surface, causing, surface, runoff, 44, chemical, processes, such, as, salinization, acidification, and, toxication, lead, to, chemical, imbalances, in, the, soil, 44, salinization, in, particular, is, detrimental, as, it, makes, land, less, productive, for, agriculture, and, affects, at, least, 20, of, all, irrigated, lands, 137, deliberate, disruption, of, soil, in, the, form, of, tillage, can, also, alter, biological, processes, in, the, soil, which, leads, to, excessive, mineralization, and, the, loss, of, nutrients, 44, desertification, is, a, type, of, land, degradation, in, drylands, in, which, fertile, areas, become, increasingly, arid, as, a, result, of, natural, processes, or, human, activities, resulting, in, loss, of, biological, productivity, this, spread, of, arid, areas, can, be, influenced, by, a, variety, of, human, factors, such, as, deforestation, improper, land, management, overgrazing, anthropogenic, climate, change, and, overexploitation, of, soil, throughout, geological, history, desertification, has, occurred, naturally, though, in, recent, times, it, is, greatly, accelerated, by, human, activity, ground, pollution, is, soil, contamination, via, pollutants, such, as, hazardous, waste, or, litter, ground, pollution, can, be, prevented, by, properly, monitoring, and, disposing, of, waste, along, with, reducing, unnecessary, chemical, and, plastic, use, unfortunately, proper, disposal, of, waste, often, is, not, economically, beneficial, or, technologically, viable, leading, to, short, term, solutions, of, waste, disposal, that, pollute, the, earth, examples, include, dumping, harmful, industrial, byproducts, overusing, agricultural, fertilizers, and, other, chemicals, and, poorly, maintaining, landfills, some, landfills, can, be, thousands, of, acres, in, size, such, as, the, apex, regional, landfill, in, las, vegas, water, pollution, on, land, is, the, contamination, of, non, oceanic, hydrological, surface, and, underground, water, features, such, as, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, aquifers, reservoirs, and, groundwater, as, a, result, of, human, activities, 6, it, may, be, caused, by, toxic, substances, e, g, oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent, organic, pollutants, industrial, waste, products, stressful, conditions, e, g, changes, of, ph, hypoxia, or, anoxia, increased, temperatures, excessive, turbidity, unpleasant, taste, or, odor, and, changes, of, salinity, or, pathogenic, organisms, the, biodiversity, of, earth, the, variety, and, variability, of, life, is, threatened, by, climate, change, human, activities, and, invasive, species, due, to, an, increase, in, the, rate, of, extinction, biodiversity, loss, is, increasing, agriculture, can, cause, biodiversity, loss, as, land, is, converted, for, agricultural, use, at, a, very, high, rate, particularly, in, the, tropics, which, directly, causes, habitat, loss, the, use, of, pesticides, and, herbicides, can, also, negatively, impact, the, health, of, local, species, 43, ecosystems, can, also, be, divided, and, degraded, by, infrastructure, development, outside, of, urban, areas, 46, biodiversity, loss, can, sometimes, be, reversed, through, ecological, restoration, or, ecological, resilience, such, as, through, the, restoration, of, abandoned, agricultural, areas, 45, however, it, may, also, be, permanent, e, g, through, land, loss, the, planet, s, ecosystem, is, quite, sensitive, occasionally, minor, changes, from, a, healthy, equilibrium, can, have, dramatic, influence, on, a, food, web, or, food, chain, up, to, and, including, the, coextinction, of, that, entire, food, chain, biodiversity, loss, leads, to, reduced, ecosystem, services, and, can, eventually, threaten, food, security, earth, is, currently, undergoing, its, sixth, mass, extinction, the, holocene, extinction, as, a, result, of, human, activities, which, push, beyond, the, planetary, boundaries, so, far, this, extinction, has, proven, irreversible, although, humans, have, used, land, for, its, natural, resources, since, ancient, times, demand, for, resources, such, as, timber, minerals, and, energy, has, grown, exponentially, since, the, industrial, revolution, due, to, population, growth, 34, when, a, natural, resource, is, depleted, to, the, point, of, diminishing, returns, it, is, considered, the, overexploitation, of, that, resource, some, natural, resources, such, as, timber, are, considered, renewable, because, with, sustainable, practices, they, replenish, to, their, previous, levels, 90, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, are, not, considered, renewable, as, they, take, millions, of, years, to, form, with, the, current, supply, of, coal, expected, to, peak, in, the, middle, of, the, 21st, century, 90, economic, materialism, or, consumerism, has, influenced, destructive, patterns, of, modern, resource, usage, in, contrast, with, pre, industrial, usage, different, varieties, of, landscapes
