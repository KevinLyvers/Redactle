saturn, is, the, sixth, planet, from, the, sun, and, the, second, largest, in, the, solar, system, after, jupiter, it, is, a, gas, giant, with, an, average, radius, of, about, nine, times, that, of, earth, it, has, an, eighth, the, average, density, of, earth, but, is, over, 95, times, more, massive, even, though, saturn, is, almost, as, big, as, jupiter, saturn, has, less, than, a, third, the, mass, of, jupiter, saturn, orbits, the, sun, at, a, distance, of, 9, 59, au, 1, 434, million, km, with, an, orbital, period, of, 29, 45, years, saturn, s, interior, is, thought, to, be, composed, of, a, rocky, core, surrounded, by, a, deep, layer, of, metallic, hydrogen, an, intermediate, layer, of, liquid, hydrogen, and, liquid, helium, and, an, outer, layer, of, gas, saturn, has, a, pale, yellow, hue, due, to, ammonia, crystals, in, its, upper, atmosphere, an, electrical, current, in, the, metallic, hydrogen, layer, is, thought, to, give, rise, to, saturn, s, planetary, magnetic, field, which, is, weaker, than, earth, s, but, has, a, magnetic, moment, 580, times, that, of, earth, because, of, saturn, s, greater, size, saturn, s, magnetic, field, strength, is, about, a, twentieth, that, of, jupiter, the, outer, atmosphere, is, generally, bland, and, lacking, in, contrast, although, long, lived, features, can, appear, wind, speeds, on, saturn, can, reach, 1, 800, kilometres, per, hour, 1, 100, miles, per, hour, the, planet, has, a, bright, and, extensive, system, of, rings, composed, mainly, of, ice, particles, with, a, smaller, amount, of, rocky, debris, and, dust, at, least, 146, moons, orbit, the, planet, of, which, 63, are, officially, named, these, do, not, include, the, hundreds, of, moonlets, in, the, rings, titan, saturn, s, largest, moon, and, the, second, largest, in, the, solar, system, is, larger, and, less, massive, than, the, planet, mercury, and, is, the, only, moon, in, the, solar, system, that, has, a, substantial, atmosphere, saturn, is, named, after, the, roman, god, of, wealth, and, agriculture, who, was, the, father, of, the, god, jupiter, its, astronomical, symbol, has, been, traced, back, to, the, greek, oxyrhynchus, papyri, where, it, can, be, seen, to, be, a, greek, kappa, rho, ligature, with, a, horizontal, stroke, as, an, abbreviation, for, cronus, the, greek, name, for, the, planet, it, later, came, to, look, like, a, lower, case, greek, eta, with, the, cross, added, at, the, top, in, the, 16th, century, to, christianize, this, pagan, symbol, the, romans, named, the, seventh, day, of, the, week, saturday, s, turni, di, s, saturn, s, day, for, the, planet, saturn, saturn, is, a, gas, giant, composed, predominantly, of, hydrogen, and, helium, it, lacks, a, definite, surface, though, it, is, likely, to, have, a, solid, core, the, planet, s, rotation, makes, it, an, oblate, spheroid, a, ball, flattened, at, the, poles, and, bulging, at, the, equator, its, equatorial, radius, is, more, than, 10, larger, than, the, polar, radius, 60, 268, km, versus, 54, 364, km, 37, 449, mi, versus, 33, 780, mi, jupiter, uranus, and, neptune, the, other, giant, planets, in, the, solar, system, are, less, oblate, the, combination, of, the, bulge, and, the, rotation, rate, means, that, the, effective, surface, gravity, along, the, equator, 8, 96, m, s, 2, is, 74, of, what, it, is, at, the, poles, and, is, lower, than, the, surface, gravity, of, earth, however, the, equatorial, escape, velocity, nearly, 36, km, s, is, much, higher, than, that, of, earth, saturn, is, the, only, planet, of, the, solar, system, that, is, less, dense, than, water, about, 30, less, although, saturn, s, core, is, considerably, denser, than, water, the, average, specific, density, of, the, planet, is, 0, 69, g, cm, 3, because, of, the, atmosphere, jupiter, has, 318, times, earth, s, mass, and, saturn, is, 95, times, earth, s, mass, together, jupiter, and, saturn, hold, 92, of, the, total, planetary, mass, in, the, solar, system, despite, consisting, mostly, of, hydrogen, and, helium, most, of, saturn, s, mass, is, not, in, the, gas, phase, because, hydrogen, becomes, a, non, ideal, liquid, when, the, density, is, above, 0, 01, g, cm, 3, which, is, reached, at, a, radius, containing, 99, 9, of, saturn, s, mass, the, temperature, pressure, and, density, inside, saturn, all, rise, steadily, toward, the, core, which, causes, hydrogen, to, be, a, metal, in, the, deeper, layers, standard, planetary, models, suggest, that, the, interior, of, saturn, is, similar, to, that, of, jupiter, having, a, small, rocky, core, surrounded, by, hydrogen, and, helium, with, trace, amounts, of, various, volatiles, analysis, of, the, distortion, shows, that, saturn, is, substantially, more, centrally, condensed, than, jupiter, and, therefore, contains, much, more, material, denser, than, hydrogen, near, its, center, saturn, s, central, regions, are, about, 50, hydrogen, by, mass, and, jupiter, s, are, about, 67, hydrogen, this, core, is, similar, in, composition, to, earth, but, is, more, dense, the, examination, of, saturn, s, gravitational, moment, in, combination, with, physical, models, of, the, interior, has, allowed, constraints, to, be, placed, on, the, mass, of, saturn, s, core, in, 2004, scientists, estimated, that, the, core, must, be, 9, 22, times, the, mass, of, earth, which, corresponds, to, a, diameter, of, about, 25, 000, km, 16, 000, mi, however, measurements, of, saturn, s, rings, suggest, a, much, more, diffuse, core, with, a, mass, equal, to, about, 17, earths, and, a, radius, equal, to, about, 60, of, saturn, s, entire, radius, this, is, surrounded, by, a, thicker, liquid, metallic, hydrogen, layer, followed, by, a, liquid, layer, of, helium, saturated, molecular, hydrogen, which, gradually, transitions, to, a, gas, as, altitude, increases, the, outermost, layer, spans, about, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, and, consists, of, gas, saturn, has, a, hot, interior, reaching, 11, 700, c, 21, 100, f, at, its, core, and, radiates, 2, 5, times, more, energy, into, space, than, it, receives, from, the, sun, jupiter, s, thermal, energy, is, generated, by, the, kelvin, helmholtz, mechanism, of, slow, gravitational, compression, but, such, a, process, alone, may, not, be, sufficient, to, explain, heat, production, for, saturn, because, it, is, less, massive, an, alternative, or, additional, mechanism, may, be, the, generation, of, heat, through, the, raining, out, of, droplets, of, helium, deep, in, saturn, s, interior, as, the, droplets, descend, through, the, lower, density, hydrogen, the, process, releases, heat, by, friction, and, leaves, saturn, s, outer, layers, depleted, of, helium, these, descending, droplets, may, have, accumulated, into, a, helium, shell, surrounding, the, core, rainfalls, of, diamonds, have, been, suggested, to, occur, within, saturn, as, well, as, in, jupiter, and, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, the, outer, atmosphere, of, saturn, contains, 96, 3, molecular, hydrogen, and, 3, 25, helium, by, volume, the, proportion, of, helium, is, significantly, deficient, compared, to, the, abundance, of, this, element, in, the, sun, the, quantity, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, metallicity, is, not, known, precisely, but, the, proportions, are, assumed, to, match, the, primordial, abundances, from, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, the, total, mass, of, these, heavier, elements, is, estimated, to, be, 19, 31, times, the, mass, of, earth, with, a, significant, fraction, located, in, saturn, s, core, region, trace, amounts, of, ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and, methane, have, been, detected, in, saturn, s, atmosphere, the, upper, clouds, are, composed, of, ammonia, crystals, while, the, lower, level, clouds, appear, to, consist, of, either, ammonium, hydrosulfide, nh, 4, sh, or, water, ultraviolet, radiation, from, the, sun, causes, methane, photolysis, in, the, upper, atmosphere, leading, to, a, series, of, hydrocarbon, chemical, reactions, with, the, resulting, products, being, carried, downward, by, eddies, and, diffusion, this, photochemical, cycle, is, modulated, by, saturn, s, annual, seasonal, cycle, cassini, observed, a, series, of, cloud, features, found, in, northern, latitudes, nicknamed, the, string, of, pearls, these, features, are, cloud, clearings, that, reside, in, deeper, cloud, layers, saturn, s, atmosphere, exhibits, a, banded, pattern, similar, to, jupiter, s, but, saturn, s, bands, are, much, fainter, and, are, much, wider, near, the, equator, the, nomenclature, used, to, describe, these, bands, is, the, same, as, on, jupiter, saturn, s, finer, cloud, patterns, were, not, observed, until, the, flybys, of, the, voyager, spacecraft, during, the, 1980s, since, then, earth, based, telescopy, has, improved, to, the, point, where, regular, observations, can, be, made, the, composition, of, the, clouds, varies, with, depth, and, increasing, pressure, in, the, upper, cloud, layers, with, temperatures, in, the, range, of, 100, 160, k, and, pressures, extending, between, 0, 5, 2, bar, the, clouds, consist, of, ammonia, ice, water, ice, clouds, begin, at, a, level, where, the, pressure, is, about, 2, 5, bar, and, extend, down, to, 9, 5, bar, where, temperatures, range, from, 185, to, 270, k, intermixed, in, this, layer, is, a, band, of, ammonium, hydrosulfide, ice, lying, in, the, pressure, range, 3, 6, bar, with, temperatures, of, 190, 235, k, finally, the, lower, layers, where, pressures, are, between, 10, and, 20, bar, and, temperatures, are, 270, 330, k, contains, a, region, of, water, droplets, with, ammonia, in, aqueous, solution, saturn, s, usually, bland, atmosphere, occasionally, exhibits, long, lived, ovals, and, other, features, common, on, jupiter, in, 1990, the, hubble, space, telescope, imaged, an, enormous, white, cloud, near, saturn, s, equator, that, was, not, present, during, the, voyager, encounters, and, in, 1994, another, smaller, storm, was, observed, the, 1990, storm, was, an, example, of, a, great, white, spot, a, short, lived, phenomenon, that, occurs, once, every, saturnian, year, roughly, every, 30, earth, years, around, the, time, of, the, northern, hemisphere, s, summer, solstice, previous, great, white, spots, were, observed, in, 1876, 1903, 1933, and, 1960, with, the, 1933, storm, being, the, best, observed, the, latest, giant, storm, was, observed, in, 2010, in, 2015, researchers, used, very, large, array, telescope, to, study, saturnian, atmosphere, and, reported, that, they, found, long, lasting, signatures, of, all, mid, latitude, giant, storms, a, mixture, of, equatorial, storms, up, to, hundreds, of, years, old, and, potentially, an, unreported, older, storm, at, 70, n, the, winds, on, saturn, are, the, second, fastest, among, the, solar, system, s, planets, after, neptune, s, voyager, data, indicate, peak, easterly, winds, of, 500, m, s, 1, 800, km, h, in, images, from, the, cassini, spacecraft, during, 2007, saturn, s, northern, hemisphere, displayed, a, bright, blue, hue, similar, to, uranus, the, color, was, most, likely, caused, by, rayleigh, scattering, thermography, has, shown, that, saturn, s, south, pole, has, a, warm, polar, vortex, the, only, known, example, of, such, a, phenomenon, in, the, solar, system, whereas, temperatures, on, saturn, are, normally, 185, c, temperatures, on, the, vortex, often, reach, as, high, as, 122, c, suspected, to, be, the, warmest, spot, on, saturn, a, persisting, hexagonal, wave, pattern, around, the, north, polar, vortex, in, the, atmosphere, at, about, 78, n, was, first, noted, in, the, voyager, images, the, sides, of, the, hexagon, are, each, about, 14, 500, km, 9, 000, mi, long, which, is, longer, than, the, diameter, of, the, earth, the, entire, structure, rotates, with, a, period, of, 10, h, 39, m, 24, s, the, same, period, as, that, of, the, planet, s, radio, emissions, which, is, assumed, to, be, equal, to, the, period, of, rotation, of, saturn, s, interior, the, hexagonal, feature, does, not, shift, in, longitude, like, the, other, clouds, in, the, visible, atmosphere, the, pattern, s, origin, is, a, matter, of, much, speculation, most, scientists, think, it, is, a, standing, wave, pattern, in, the, atmosphere, polygonal, shapes, have, been, replicated, in, the, laboratory, through, differential, rotation, of, fluids, hst, imaging, of, the, south, polar, region, indicates, the, presence, of, a, jet, stream, but, no, strong, polar, vortex, nor, any, hexagonal, standing, wave, nasa, reported, in, november, 2006, that, cassini, had, observed, a, hurricane, like, storm, locked, to, the, south, pole, that, had, a, clearly, defined, eyewall, eyewall, clouds, had, not, previously, been, seen, on, any, planet, other, than, earth, for, example, images, from, the, galileo, spacecraft, did, not, show, an, eyewall, in, the, great, red, spot, of, jupiter, the, south, pole, storm, may, have, been, present, for, billions, of, years, this, vortex, is, comparable, to, the, size, of, earth, and, it, has, winds, of, 550, km, h, saturn, has, an, intrinsic, magnetic, field, that, has, a, simple, symmetric, shape, a, magnetic, dipole, its, strength, at, the, equator, 0, 2, gauss, 20, t, is, approximately, one, twentieth, of, that, of, the, field, around, jupiter, and, slightly, weaker, than, earth, s, magnetic, field, as, a, result, saturn, s, magnetosphere, is, much, smaller, than, jupiter, s, when, voyager, 2, entered, the, magnetosphere, the, solar, wind, pressure, was, high, and, the, magnetosphere, extended, only, 19, saturn, radii, or, 1, 1, million, km, 684, 000, mi, although, it, enlarged, within, several, hours, and, remained, so, for, about, three, days, most, probably, the, magnetic, field, is, generated, similarly, to, that, of, jupiter, by, currents, in, the, liquid, metallic, hydrogen, layer, called, a, metallic, hydrogen, dynamo, this, magnetosphere, is, efficient, at, deflecting, the, solar, wind, particles, from, the, sun, the, moon, titan, orbits, within, the, outer, part, of, saturn, s, magnetosphere, and, contributes, plasma, from, the, ionized, particles, in, titan, s, outer, atmosphere, saturn, s, magnetosphere, like, earth, s, produces, aurorae, the, average, distance, between, saturn, and, the, sun, is, over, 1, 4, billion, kilometers, 9, au, with, an, average, orbital, speed, of, 9, 68, km, s, it, takes, saturn, 10, 759, earth, days, or, about, 29, 1, 2, years, to, finish, one, revolution, around, the, sun, as, a, consequence, it, forms, a, near, 5, 2, mean, motion, resonance, with, jupiter, the, elliptical, orbit, of, saturn, is, inclined, 2, 48, relative, to, the, orbital, plane, of, the, earth, the, perihelion, and, aphelion, distances, are, respectively, 9, 195, and, 9, 957, au, on, average, the, visible, features, on, saturn, rotate, at, different, rates, depending, on, latitude, and, multiple, rotation, periods, have, been, assigned, to, various, regions, as, in, jupiter, s, case, astronomers, use, three, different, systems, for, specifying, the, rotation, rate, of, saturn, system, i, has, a, period, of, 10, h, 14, m, 00, s, 844, 3, d, and, encompasses, the, equatorial, zone, the, south, equatorial, belt, and, the, north, equatorial, belt, the, polar, regions, are, considered, to, have, rotation, rates, similar, to, system, i, all, other, saturnian, latitudes, excluding, the, north, and, south, polar, regions, are, indicated, as, system, ii, and, have, been, assigned, a, rotation, period, of, 10, h, 38, m, 25, 4, s, 810, 76, d, system, iii, refers, to, saturn, s, internal, rotation, rate, based, on, radio, emissions, from, the, planet, detected, by, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, system, iii, has, a, rotation, period, of, 10, h, 39, m, 22, 4, s, 810, 8, d, system, iii, has, largely, superseded, system, ii, a, precise, value, for, the, rotation, period, of, the, interior, remains, elusive, while, approaching, saturn, in, 2004, cassini, found, that, the, radio, rotation, period, of, saturn, had, increased, appreciably, to, approximately, 10, h, 45, m, 45, s, 36, s, an, estimate, of, saturn, s, rotation, as, an, indicated, rotation, rate, for, saturn, as, a, whole, based, on, a, compilation, of, various, measurements, from, the, cassini, voyager, and, pioneer, probes, is, 10, h, 32, m, 35, s, studies, of, the, planet, s, c, ring, yield, a, rotation, period, of, 10, h, 33, m, 38, s, 1, m, 52, s, 1, m, 19, s, in, march, 2007, it, was, found, that, the, variation, in, radio, emissions, from, the, planet, did, not, match, saturn, s, rotation, rate, this, variance, may, be, caused, by, geyser, activity, on, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, the, water, vapor, emitted, into, saturn, s, orbit, by, this, activity, becomes, charged, and, creates, a, drag, upon, saturn, s, magnetic, field, slowing, its, rotation, slightly, relative, to, the, rotation, of, the, planet, an, apparent, oddity, for, saturn, is, that, it, does, not, have, any, known, trojan, asteroids, these, are, minor, planets, that, orbit, the, sun, at, the, stable, lagrangian, points, designated, l, 4, and, l, 5, located, at, 60, angles, to, the, planet, along, its, orbit, trojan, asteroids, have, been, discovered, for, mars, jupiter, uranus, and, neptune, orbital, resonance, mechanisms, including, secular, resonance, are, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, the, missing, saturnian, trojans, saturn, has, 146, known, moons, 63, of, which, have, formal, names, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, another, 100, 30, outer, irregular, moons, larger, than, 3, km, 2, mi, in, diameter, in, addition, there, is, evidence, of, dozens, to, hundreds, of, moonlets, with, diameters, of, 40, 500, meters, in, saturn, s, rings, which, are, not, considered, to, be, true, moons, titan, the, largest, moon, comprises, more, than, 90, of, the, mass, in, orbit, around, saturn, including, the, rings, saturn, s, second, largest, moon, rhea, may, have, a, tenuous, ring, system, of, its, own, along, with, a, tenuous, atmosphere, many, of, the, other, moons, are, small, 131, are, less, than, 50, km, in, diameter, traditionally, most, of, saturn, s, moons, have, been, named, after, titans, of, greek, mythology, titan, is, the, only, satellite, in, the, solar, system, with, a, major, atmosphere, in, which, a, complex, organic, chemistry, occurs, it, is, the, only, satellite, with, hydrocarbon, lakes, on, 6, june, 2013, scientists, at, the, iaa, csic, reported, the, detection, of, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, in, the, upper, atmosphere, of, titan, a, possible, precursor, for, life, on, 23, june, 2014, nasa, claimed, to, have, strong, evidence, that, nitrogen, in, the, atmosphere, of, titan, came, from, materials, in, the, oort, cloud, associated, with, comets, and, not, from, the, materials, that, formed, saturn, in, earlier, times, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, which, seems, similar, in, chemical, makeup, to, comets, has, often, been, regarded, as, a, potential, habitat, for, microbial, life, evidence, of, this, possibility, includes, the, satellite, s, salt, rich, particles, having, an, ocean, like, composition, that, indicates, most, of, enceladus, s, expelled, ice, comes, from, the, evaporation, of, liquid, salt, water, a, 2015, flyby, by, cassini, through, a, plume, on, enceladus, found, most, of, the, ingredients, to, sustain, life, forms, that, live, by, methanogenesis, in, april, 2014, nasa, scientists, reported, the, possible, beginning, of, a, new, moon, within, the, a, ring, which, was, imaged, by, cassini, on, 15, april, 2013, saturn, is, probably, best, known, for, the, system, of, planetary, rings, that, makes, it, visually, unique, the, rings, extend, from, 6, 630, to, 120, 700, kilometres, 4, 120, to, 75, 000, mi, outward, from, saturn, s, equator, and, average, approximately, 20, metres, 66, ft, in, thickness, they, are, composed, predominantly, of, water, ice, with, trace, amounts, of, tholin, impurities, and, a, peppered, coating, of, approximately, 7, amorphous, carbon, the, particles, that, make, up, the, rings, range, in, size, from, specks, of, dust, up, to, 10, m, while, the, other, gas, giants, also, have, ring, systems, saturn, s, is, the, largest, and, most, visible, there, is, a, debate, on, the, age, of, the, rings, one, side, supports, that, they, are, ancient, and, were, created, simultaneously, with, saturn, from, the, original, nebular, material, around, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, or, shortly, after, the, lhb, around, 4, 1, to, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, the, other, side, supports, that, they, are, much, younger, created, around, 100, million, years, ago, an, mit, research, team, supporting, the, latter, theory, proposed, that, the, rings, are, remnant, of, a, destroyed, moon, of, saturn, named, chrysalis, beyond, the, main, rings, at, a, distance, of, 12, million, km, 7, 5, million, mi, from, the, planet, is, the, sparse, phoebe, ring, it, is, tilted, at, an, angle, of, 27, to, the, other, rings, and, like, phoebe, orbits, in, retrograde, fashion, some, of, the, moons, of, saturn, including, pandora, and, prometheus, act, as, shepherd, moons, to, confine, the, rings, and, prevent, them, from, spreading, out, pan, and, atlas, cause, weak, linear, density, waves, in, saturn, s, rings, that, have, yielded, more, reliable, calculations, of, their, masses, in, september, 2023, astronomers, reported, studies, suggesting, that, the, rings, of, saturn, may, have, resulted, from, the, collision, of, two, moons, a, few, hundred, million, years, ago, the, observation, and, exploration, of, saturn, can, be, divided, into, three, phases, 1, pre, modern, observations, with, the, naked, eye, 2, telescopic, observations, from, earth, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, and, 3, visitation, by, space, probes, in, orbit, or, on, flyby, in, the, 21st, century, telescopic, observations, continue, from, earth, including, earth, orbiting, observatories, like, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, until, its, 2017, retirement, from, the, cassini, orbiter, around, saturn, saturn, has, been, known, since, prehistoric, times, and, in, early, recorded, history, it, was, a, major, character, in, various, mythologies, babylonian, astronomers, systematically, observed, and, recorded, the, movements, of, saturn, in, ancient, greek, the, planet, was, known, as, phainon, and, in, roman, times, it, was, known, as, the, star, of, saturn, in, ancient, roman, mythology, the, planet, phainon, was, sacred, to, this, agricultural, god, from, which, the, planet, takes, its, modern, name, the, romans, considered, the, god, saturnus, the, equivalent, of, the, greek, god, cronus, in, modern, greek, the, planet, retains, the, name, cronus, kronos, the, greek, scientist, ptolemy, based, his, calculations, of, saturn, s, orbit, on, observations, he, made, while, it, was, in, opposition, in, hindu, astrology, there, are, nine, astrological, objects, known, as, navagrahas, saturn, is, known, as, shani, and, judges, everyone, based, on, the, good, and, bad, deeds, performed, in, life, ancient, chinese, and, japanese, culture, designated, the, planet, saturn, as, the, earth, star, this, was, based, on, five, elements, which, were, traditionally, used, to, classify, natural, elements, in, hebrew, saturn, is, called, shabbathai, its, angel, is, cassiel, its, intelligence, or, beneficial, spirit, is, ag, l, hebrew, romanized, agyal, and, its, darker, spirit, demon, is, z, z, l, hebrew, romanized, zazl, zazel, has, been, described, as, a, great, angel, invoked, in, solomonic, magic, who, is, effective, in, love, conjurations, in, ottoman, turkish, urdu, and, malay, the, name, of, zazel, is, zuhal, derived, from, the, arabic, language, arabic, romanized, zuhal, saturn, s, rings, require, at, least, a, 15, mm, diameter, telescope, to, resolve, and, thus, were, not, known, to, exist, until, christiaan, huygens, saw, them, in, 1655, and, published, about, this, in, 1659, galileo, with, his, primitive, telescope, in, 1610, incorrectly, thought, of, saturn, s, appearing, not, quite, round, as, two, moons, on, saturn, s, sides, it, was, not, until, huygens, used, greater, telescopic, magnification, that, this, notion, was, refuted, and, the, rings, were, truly, seen, for, the, first, time, huygens, also, discovered, saturn, s, moon, titan, giovanni, domenico, cassini, later, discovered, four, other, moons, iapetus, rhea, tethys, and, dione, in, 1675, cassini, discovered, the, gap, now, known, as, the, cassini, division, no, further, discoveries, of, significance, were, made, until, 1789, when, william, herschel, discovered, two, further, moons, mimas, and, enceladus, the, irregularly, shaped, satellite, hyperion, which, has, a, resonance, with, titan, was, discovered, in, 1848, by, a, british, team, in, 1899, william, henry, pickering, discovered, phoebe, a, highly, irregular, satellite, that, does, not, rotate, synchronously, with, saturn, as, the, larger, moons, do, phoebe, was, the, first, such, satellite, found, and, it, took, more, than, a, year, to, orbit, saturn, in, a, retrograde, orbit, during, the, early, 20th, century, research, on, titan, led, to, the, confirmation, in, 1944, that, it, had, a, thick, atmosphere, a, feature, unique, among, the, solar, system, s, moons, pioneer, 11, made, the, first, flyby, of, saturn, in, september, 1979, when, it, passed, within, 20, 000, km, 12, 000, mi, of, the, planet, s, cloud, tops, images, were, taken, of, the, planet, and, a, few, of, its, moons, although, their, resolution, was, too, low, to, discern, surface, detail, the, spacecraft, also, studied, saturn, s, rings, revealing, the, thin, f, ring, and, the, fact, that, dark, gaps, in, the, rings, are, bright, when, viewed, at, a, high, phase, angle, towards, the, sun, meaning, that, they, contain, fine, light, scattering, material, in, addition, pioneer, 11, measured, the, temperature, of, titan, in, november, 1980, the, voyager, 1, probe, visited, the, saturn, system, it, sent, back, the, first, high, resolution, images, of, the, planet, its, rings, and, satellites, surface, features, of, various, moons, were, seen, for, the, first, time, voyager, 1, performed, a, close, flyby, of, titan, increasing, knowledge, of, the, atmosphere, of, the, moon, it, proved, that, titan, s, atmosphere, is, impenetrable, at, visible, wavelengths, therefore, no, surface, details, were, seen, the, flyby, changed, the, spacecraft, s, trajectory, out, of, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, almost, a, year, later, in, august, 1981, voyager, 2, continued, the, study, of, the, saturn, system, more, close, up, images, of, saturn, s, moons, were, acquired, as, well, as, evidence, of, changes, in, the, atmosphere, and, the, rings, during, the, flyby, the, probe, s, turnable, camera, platform, stuck, for, a, couple, of, days, and, some, planned, imaging, was, lost, saturn, s, gravity, was, used, to, direct, the, spacecraft, s, trajectory, towards, uranus, the, probes, discovered, and, confirmed, several, new, satellites, orbiting, near, or, within, the, planet, s, rings, as, well, as, the, small, maxwell, gap, a, gap, within, the, c, ring, and, keeler, gap, a, 42, km, wide, gap, in, the, a, ring, the, cassini, huygens, space, probe, entered, orbit, around, saturn, on, 1, july, 2004, in, june, 2004, it, conducted, a, close, flyby, of, phoebe, sending, back, high, resolution, images, and, data, cassini, s, flyby, of, saturn, s, largest, moon, titan, captured, radar, images, of, large, lakes, and, their, coastlines, with, numerous, islands, and, mountains, the, orbiter, completed, two, titan, flybys, before, releasing, the, huygens, probe, on, 25, december, 2004, huygens, descended, onto, the, surface, of, titan, on, 14, january, 2005, starting, in, early, 2005, scientists, used, cassini, to, track, lightning, on, saturn, the, power, of, the, lightning, is, approximately, 1, 000, times, that, of, lightning, on, earth, in, 2006, nasa, reported, that, cassini, had, found, evidence, of, liquid, water, reservoirs, no, more, than, tens, of, meters, below, the, surface, that, erupt, in, geysers, on, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, these, jets, of, icy, particles, are, emitted, into, orbit, around, saturn, from, vents, in, the, moon, s, south, polar, region, over, 100, geysers, have, been, identified, on, enceladus, in, may, 2011, nasa, scientists, reported, that, enceladus, is, emerging, as, the, most, habitable, spot, beyond, earth, in, the, solar, system, for, life, as, we, know, it, cassini, photographs, have, revealed, a, previously, undiscovered, planetary, ring, outside, the, brighter, main, rings, of, saturn, and, inside, the, g, and, e, rings, the, source, of, this, ring, is, hypothesized, to, be, the, crashing, of, a, meteoroid, off, janus, and, epimetheus, in, july, 2006, images, were, returned, of, hydrocarbon, lakes, near, titan, s, north, pole, the, presence, of, which, were, confirmed, in, january, 2007, in, march, 2007, hydrocarbon, seas, were, found, near, the, north, pole, the, largest, of, which, is, almost, the, size, of, the, caspian, sea, in, october, 2006, the, probe, detected, an, 8, 000, km, 5, 000, mi, diameter, cyclone, like, storm, with, an, eyewall, at, saturn, s, south, pole, from, 2004, to, 2, november, 2009, the, probe, discovered, and, confirmed, eight, new, satellites, in, april, 2013, cassini, sent, back, images, of, a, hurricane, at, the, planet, s, north, pole, 20, times, larger, than, those, found, on, earth, with, winds, faster, than, 530, km, h, 330, mph, on, 15, september, 2017, the, cassini, huygens, spacecraft, performed, the, grand, finale, of, its, mission, a, number, of, passes, through, gaps, between, saturn, and, saturn, s, inner, rings, the, atmospheric, entry, of, cassini, ended, the, mission, the, continued, exploration, of, saturn, is, still, considered, to, be, a, viable, option, for, nasa, as, part, of, their, ongoing, new, frontiers, program, of, missions, nasa, previously, requested, for, plans, to, be, put, forward, for, a, mission, to, saturn, that, included, the, saturn, atmospheric, entry, probe, and, possible, investigations, into, the, habitability, and, possible, discovery, of, life, on, saturn, s, moons, titan, and, enceladus, by, dragonfly, saturn, is, the, most, distant, of, the, five, planets, easily, visible, to, the, naked, eye, from, earth, the, other, four, being, mercury, venus, mars, and, jupiter, uranus, and, occasionally, 4, vesta, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, dark, skies, saturn, appears, to, the, naked, eye, in, the, night, sky, as, a, bright, yellowish, point, of, light, the, mean, apparent, magnitude, of, saturn, is, 0, 46, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 0, 34, most, of, the, magnitude, variation, is, due, to, the, inclination, of, the, ring, system, relative, to, the, sun, and, earth, the, brightest, magnitude, 0, 55, occurs, near, the, time, when, the, plane, of, the, rings, is, inclined, most, highly, and, the, faintest, magnitude, 1, 17, occurs, around, the, time, when, they, are, least, inclined, it, takes, approximately, 29, 4, years, for, the, planet, to, complete, an, entire, circuit, of, the, ecliptic, against, the, background, constellations, of, the, zodiac, most, people, will, require, an, optical, aid, very, large, binoculars, or, a, small, telescope, that, magnifies, at, least, 30, times, to, achieve, an, image, of, saturn, s, rings, in, which, a, clear, resolution, is, present, when, earth, passes, through, the, ring, plane, which, occurs, twice, every, saturnian, year, roughly, every, 15, earth, years, the, rings, briefly, disappear, from, view, because, they, are, so, thin, such, a, disappearance, will, next, occur, in, 2025, but, saturn, will, be, too, close, to, the, sun, for, observations, saturn, and, its, rings, are, best, seen, when, the, planet, is, at, or, near, opposition, the, configuration, of, a, planet, when, it, is, at, an, elongation, of, 180, and, thus, appears, opposite, the, sun, in, the, sky, a, saturnian, opposition, occurs, every, year, approximately, every, 378, days, and, results, in, the, planet, appearing, at, its, brightest, both, the, earth, and, saturn, orbit, the, sun, on, eccentric, orbits, which, means, their, distances, from, the, sun, vary, over, time, and, therefore, so, do, their, distances, from, each, other, hence, varying, the, brightness, of, saturn, from, one, opposition, to, the, next, saturn, also, appears, brighter, when, the, rings, are, angled, such, that, they, are, more, visible, for, example, during, the, opposition, of, 17, december, 2002, saturn, appeared, at, its, brightest, due, to, the, favorable, orientation, of, its, rings, relative, to, the, earth, even, though, saturn, was, closer, to, the, earth, and, sun, in, late, 2003, from, time, to, time, saturn, is, occulted, by, the, moon, that, is, the, moon, covers, up, saturn, in, the, sky, as, with, all, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, occultations, of, saturn, occur, in, seasons, saturnian, occultations, will, take, place, monthly, for, about, a, 12, month, period, followed, by, about, a, five, year, period, in, which, no, such, activity, is, registered, the, moon, s, orbit, is, inclined, by, several, degrees, relative, to, saturn, s, so, occultations, will, only, occur, when, saturn, is, near, one, of, the, points, in, the, sky, where, the, two, planes, intersect, both, the, length, of, saturn, s, year, and, the, 18, 6, earth, year, nodal, precession, period, of, the, moon, s, orbit, influence, the, periodicity, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow,
