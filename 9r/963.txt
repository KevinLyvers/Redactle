classical, mechanics, is, a, physical, theory, describing, the, motion, of, objects, such, as, projectiles, parts, of, machinery, spacecraft, planets, stars, and, galaxies, the, development, of, classical, mechanics, involved, substantial, change, in, the, methods, and, philosophy, of, physics, the, qualifier, classical, distinguishes, this, type, of, mechanics, from, physics, developed, after, the, revolutions, in, physics, of, the, early, 20th, century, all, of, which, revealed, limitations, in, classical, mechanics, the, earliest, formulation, of, classical, mechanics, is, often, referred, to, as, newtonian, mechanics, it, consists, of, the, physical, concepts, based, on, the, 17th, century, foundational, works, of, sir, isaac, newton, and, the, mathematical, methods, invented, by, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, leonhard, euler, and, others, to, describe, the, motion, of, bodies, under, the, influence, of, forces, later, methods, based, on, energy, were, developed, by, euler, joseph, louis, lagrange, william, rowan, hamilton, and, others, leading, to, the, development, of, analytical, mechanics, which, includes, lagrangian, mechanics, and, hamiltonian, mechanics, these, advances, made, predominantly, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, extended, beyond, earlier, works, they, are, with, some, modification, used, in, all, areas, of, modern, physics, if, the, present, state, of, an, object, that, obeys, the, laws, of, classical, mechanics, is, known, it, is, possible, to, determine, how, it, will, move, in, the, future, and, how, it, has, moved, in, the, past, chaos, theory, shows, that, the, long, term, predictions, of, classical, mechanics, are, not, reliable, classical, mechanics, provides, accurate, results, when, studying, objects, that, are, not, extremely, massive, and, have, speeds, not, approaching, the, speed, of, light, with, objects, about, the, size, of, an, atom, s, diameter, it, becomes, necessary, to, use, quantum, mechanics, to, describe, velocities, approaching, the, speed, of, light, special, relativity, is, needed, in, cases, where, objects, become, extremely, massive, general, relativity, becomes, applicable, some, modern, sources, include, relativistic, mechanics, in, classical, physics, as, representing, the, field, in, its, most, developed, and, accurate, form, classical, mechanics, was, traditionally, divided, into, three, main, branches, statics, is, the, branch, of, classical, mechanics, that, is, concerned, with, the, analysis, of, force, and, torque, acting, on, a, physical, system, that, does, not, experience, an, acceleration, but, rather, is, in, equilibrium, with, its, environment, kinematics, describes, the, motion, of, points, bodies, objects, and, systems, of, bodies, groups, of, objects, without, considering, the, forces, that, cause, them, to, move, kinematics, as, a, field, of, study, is, often, referred, to, as, the, geometry, of, motion, and, is, occasionally, seen, as, a, branch, of, mathematics, dynamics, goes, beyond, merely, describing, objects, behavior, and, also, considers, the, forces, which, explain, it, some, authors, for, example, taylor, 2005, and, greenwood, 1997, include, special, relativity, within, classical, dynamics, another, division, is, based, on, the, choice, of, mathematical, formalism, classical, mechanics, can, be, mathematically, presented, in, multiple, different, ways, the, physical, content, of, these, different, formulations, is, the, same, but, they, provide, different, insights, and, facilitate, different, types, of, calculations, while, the, term, newtonian, mechanics, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, non, relativistic, classical, physics, it, can, also, refer, to, a, particular, formalism, based, on, newton, s, laws, of, motion, newtonian, mechanics, in, this, sense, emphasizes, force, as, a, vector, quantity, in, contrast, analytical, mechanics, uses, scalar, properties, of, motion, representing, the, system, as, a, whole, usually, its, kinetic, energy, and, potential, energy, the, equations, of, motion, are, derived, from, the, scalar, quantity, by, some, underlying, principle, about, the, scalar, s, variation, two, dominant, branches, of, analytical, mechanics, are, lagrangian, mechanics, which, uses, generalized, coordinates, and, corresponding, generalized, velocities, in, configuration, space, and, hamiltonian, mechanics, which, uses, coordinates, and, corresponding, momenta, in, phase, space, both, formulations, are, equivalent, by, a, legendre, transformation, on, the, generalized, coordinates, velocities, and, momenta, therefore, both, contain, the, same, information, for, describing, the, dynamics, of, a, system, there, are, other, formulations, such, as, hamilton, jacobi, theory, routhian, mechanics, and, appell, s, equation, of, motion, all, equations, of, motion, for, particles, and, fields, in, any, formalism, can, be, derived, from, the, widely, applicable, result, called, the, principle, of, least, action, one, result, is, noether, s, theorem, a, statement, which, connects, conservation, laws, to, their, associated, symmetries, alternatively, a, division, can, be, made, by, region, of, application, for, simplicity, classical, mechanics, often, models, real, world, objects, as, point, particles, that, is, objects, with, negligible, size, the, motion, of, a, point, particle, is, determined, by, a, small, number, of, parameters, its, position, mass, and, the, forces, applied, to, it, classical, mechanics, also, describes, the, more, complex, motions, of, extended, non, pointlike, objects, euler, s, laws, provide, extensions, to, newton, s, laws, in, this, area, the, concepts, of, angular, momentum, rely, on, the, same, calculus, used, to, describe, one, dimensional, motion, the, rocket, equation, extends, the, notion, of, rate, of, change, of, an, object, s, momentum, to, include, the, effects, of, an, object, losing, mass, these, generalizations, extensions, are, derived, from, newton, s, laws, say, by, decomposing, a, solid, body, into, a, collection, of, points, in, reality, the, kind, of, objects, that, classical, mechanics, can, describe, always, have, a, non, zero, size, the, behavior, of, very, small, particles, such, as, the, electron, is, more, accurately, described, by, quantum, mechanics, objects, with, non, zero, size, have, more, complicated, behavior, than, hypothetical, point, particles, because, of, the, additional, degrees, of, freedom, e, g, a, baseball, can, spin, while, it, is, moving, however, the, results, for, point, particles, can, be, used, to, study, such, objects, by, treating, them, as, composite, objects, made, of, a, large, number, of, collectively, acting, point, particles, the, center, of, mass, of, a, composite, object, behaves, like, a, point, particle, classical, mechanics, assumes, that, matter, and, energy, have, definite, knowable, attributes, such, as, location, in, space, and, speed, non, relativistic, mechanics, also, assumes, that, forces, act, instantaneously, see, also, action, at, a, distance, the, position, of, a, point, particle, is, defined, in, relation, to, a, coordinate, system, centered, on, an, arbitrary, fixed, reference, point, in, space, called, the, origin, o, a, simple, coordinate, system, might, describe, the, position, of, a, particle, p, with, a, vector, notated, by, an, arrow, labeled, r, that, points, from, the, origin, o, to, point, p, in, general, the, point, particle, does, not, need, to, be, stationary, relative, to, o, in, cases, where, p, is, moving, relative, to, o, r, is, defined, as, a, function, of, t, time, in, pre, einstein, relativity, known, as, galilean, relativity, time, is, considered, an, absolute, i, e, the, time, interval, that, is, observed, to, elapse, between, any, given, pair, of, events, is, the, same, for, all, observers, in, addition, to, relying, on, absolute, time, classical, mechanics, assumes, euclidean, geometry, for, the, structure, of, space, the, velocity, or, the, rate, of, change, of, displacement, with, time, is, defined, as, the, derivative, of, the, position, with, respect, to, time, in, classical, mechanics, velocities, are, directly, additive, and, subtractive, for, example, if, one, car, travels, east, at, 60, km, h, and, passes, another, car, traveling, in, the, same, direction, at, 50, km, h, the, slower, car, perceives, the, faster, car, as, traveling, east, at, 60, 50, 10, km, h, however, from, the, perspective, of, the, faster, car, the, slower, car, is, moving, 10, km, h, to, the, west, often, denoted, as, 10, km, h, where, the, sign, implies, opposite, direction, velocities, are, directly, additive, as, vector, quantities, they, must, be, dealt, with, using, vector, analysis, mathematically, if, the, velocity, of, the, first, object, in, the, previous, discussion, is, denoted, by, the, vector, u, u, d, and, the, velocity, of, the, second, object, by, the, vector, v, v, e, where, u, is, the, speed, of, the, first, object, v, is, the, speed, of, the, second, object, and, d, and, e, are, unit, vectors, in, the, directions, of, motion, of, each, object, respectively, then, the, velocity, of, the, first, object, as, seen, by, the, second, object, is, similarly, the, first, object, sees, the, velocity, of, the, second, object, as, when, both, objects, are, moving, in, the, same, direction, this, equation, can, be, simplified, to, or, by, ignoring, direction, the, difference, can, be, given, in, terms, of, speed, only, the, acceleration, or, rate, of, change, of, velocity, is, the, derivative, of, the, velocity, with, respect, to, time, the, second, derivative, of, the, position, with, respect, to, time, acceleration, represents, the, velocity, s, change, over, time, velocity, can, change, in, magnitude, direction, or, both, occasionally, a, decrease, in, the, magnitude, of, velocity, v, is, referred, to, as, deceleration, but, generally, any, change, in, the, velocity, over, time, including, deceleration, is, referred, to, as, acceleration, while, the, position, velocity, and, acceleration, of, a, particle, can, be, described, with, respect, to, any, observer, in, any, state, of, motion, classical, mechanics, assumes, the, existence, of, a, special, family, of, reference, frames, in, which, the, mechanical, laws, of, nature, take, a, comparatively, simple, form, these, special, reference, frames, are, called, inertial, frames, an, inertial, frame, is, an, idealized, frame, of, reference, within, which, an, object, with, zero, net, force, acting, upon, it, moves, with, a, constant, velocity, that, is, it, is, either, at, rest, or, moving, uniformly, in, a, straight, line, in, an, inertial, frame, newton, s, law, of, motion, f, m, a, displaystyle, f, ma, is, valid, 185, non, inertial, reference, frames, accelerate, in, relation, to, another, inertial, frame, a, body, rotating, with, respect, to, an, inertial, frame, is, not, an, inertial, frame, when, viewed, from, an, inertial, frame, particles, in, the, non, inertial, frame, appear, to, move, in, ways, not, explained, by, forces, from, existing, fields, in, the, reference, frame, hence, it, appears, that, there, are, other, forces, that, enter, the, equations, of, motion, solely, as, a, result, of, the, relative, acceleration, these, forces, are, referred, to, as, fictitious, forces, inertia, forces, or, pseudo, forces, consider, two, reference, frames, s, and, s, for, observers, in, each, of, the, reference, frames, an, event, has, space, time, coordinates, of, x, y, z, t, in, frame, s, and, x, y, z, t, in, frame, s, assuming, time, is, measured, the, same, in, all, reference, frames, if, we, require, x, x, when, t, 0, then, the, relation, between, the, space, time, coordinates, of, the, same, event, observed, from, the, reference, frames, s, and, s, which, are, moving, at, a, relative, velocity, u, in, the, x, direction, is, this, set, of, formulas, defines, a, group, transformation, known, as, the, galilean, transformation, informally, the, galilean, transform, this, group, is, a, limiting, case, of, the, poincar, group, used, in, special, relativity, the, limiting, case, applies, when, the, velocity, u, is, very, small, compared, to, c, the, speed, of, light, the, transformations, have, the, following, consequences, for, some, problems, it, is, convenient, to, use, rotating, coordinates, reference, frames, thereby, one, can, either, keep, a, mapping, to, a, convenient, inertial, frame, or, introduce, additionally, a, fictitious, centrifugal, force, and, coriolis, force, a, force, in, physics, is, any, action, that, causes, an, object, s, velocity, to, change, that, is, to, accelerate, a, force, originates, from, within, a, field, such, as, an, electro, static, field, caused, by, static, electrical, charges, electro, magnetic, field, caused, by, moving, charges, or, gravitational, field, caused, by, mass, among, others, newton, was, the, first, to, mathematically, express, the, relationship, between, force, and, momentum, some, physicists, interpret, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, as, a, definition, of, force, and, mass, while, others, consider, it, a, fundamental, postulate, a, law, of, nature, either, interpretation, has, the, same, mathematical, consequences, historically, known, as, newton, s, second, law, the, quantity, m, v, is, called, the, canonical, momentum, the, net, force, on, a, particle, is, thus, equal, to, the, rate, of, change, of, the, momentum, of, the, particle, with, time, since, the, definition, of, acceleration, is, a, d, v, d, t, the, second, law, can, be, written, in, the, simplified, and, more, familiar, form, so, long, as, the, force, acting, on, a, particle, is, known, newton, s, second, law, is, sufficient, to, describe, the, motion, of, a, particle, once, independent, relations, for, each, force, acting, on, a, particle, are, available, they, can, be, substituted, into, newton, s, second, law, to, obtain, an, ordinary, differential, equation, which, is, called, the, equation, of, motion, as, an, example, assume, that, friction, is, the, only, force, acting, on, the, particle, and, that, it, may, be, modeled, as, a, function, of, the, velocity, of, the, particle, for, example, where, is, a, positive, constant, the, negative, sign, states, that, the, force, is, opposite, the, sense, of, the, velocity, then, the, equation, of, motion, is, this, can, be, integrated, to, obtain, where, v, 0, is, the, initial, velocity, this, means, that, the, velocity, of, this, particle, decays, exponentially, to, zero, as, time, progresses, in, this, case, an, equivalent, viewpoint, is, that, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, is, absorbed, by, friction, which, converts, it, to, heat, energy, in, accordance, with, the, conservation, of, energy, and, the, particle, is, slowing, down, this, expression, can, be, further, integrated, to, obtain, the, position, r, of, the, particle, as, a, function, of, time, important, forces, include, the, gravitational, force, and, the, lorentz, force, for, electromagnetism, in, addition, newton, s, third, law, can, sometimes, be, used, to, deduce, the, forces, acting, on, a, particle, if, it, is, known, that, particle, a, exerts, a, force, f, on, another, particle, b, it, follows, that, b, must, exert, an, equal, and, opposite, reaction, force, f, on, a, the, strong, form, of, newton, s, third, law, requires, that, f, and, f, act, along, the, line, connecting, a, and, b, while, the, weak, form, does, not, illustrations, of, the, weak, form, of, newton, s, third, law, are, often, found, for, magnetic, forces, if, a, constant, force, f, is, applied, to, a, particle, that, makes, a, displacement, r, the, work, done, by, the, force, is, defined, as, the, scalar, product, of, the, force, and, displacement, vectors, more, generally, if, the, force, varies, as, a, function, of, position, as, the, particle, moves, from, r, 1, to, r, 2, along, a, path, c, the, work, done, on, the, particle, is, given, by, the, line, integral, if, the, work, done, in, moving, the, particle, from, r, 1, to, r, 2, is, the, same, no, matter, what, path, is, taken, the, force, is, said, to, be, conservative, gravity, is, a, conservative, force, as, is, the, force, due, to, an, idealized, spring, as, given, by, hooke, s, law, the, force, due, to, friction, is, non, conservative, the, kinetic, energy, e, k, of, a, particle, of, mass, m, travelling, at, speed, v, is, given, by, for, extended, objects, composed, of, many, particles, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, composite, body, is, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, the, particles, the, work, energy, theorem, states, that, for, a, particle, of, constant, mass, m, the, total, work, w, done, on, the, particle, as, it, moves, from, position, r, 1, to, r, 2, is, equal, to, the, change, in, kinetic, energy, e, k, of, the, particle, conservative, forces, can, be, expressed, as, the, gradient, of, a, scalar, function, known, as, the, potential, energy, and, denoted, e, p, if, all, the, forces, acting, on, a, particle, are, conservative, and, e, p, is, the, total, potential, energy, which, is, defined, as, a, work, of, involved, forces, to, rearrange, mutual, positions, of, bodies, obtained, by, summing, the, potential, energies, corresponding, to, each, force, the, decrease, in, the, potential, energy, is, equal, to, the, increase, in, the, kinetic, energy, this, result, is, known, as, conservation, of, energy, and, states, that, the, total, energy, is, constant, in, time, it, is, often, useful, because, many, commonly, encountered, forces, are, conservative, lagrangian, mechanics, is, a, formulation, of, classical, mechanics, founded, on, the, stationary, action, principle, also, known, as, the, principle, of, least, action, it, was, introduced, by, the, italian, french, mathematician, and, astronomer, joseph, louis, lagrange, in, his, presentation, to, the, turin, academy, of, science, in, 1760, culminating, in, his, 1788, grand, opus, m, canique, analytique, lagrangian, mechanics, describes, a, mechanical, system, as, a, pair, m, l, textstyle, m, l, consisting, of, a, configuration, space, m, textstyle, m, and, a, smooth, function, l, textstyle, l, within, that, space, called, a, lagrangian, for, many, systems, l, t, v, textstyle, l, t, v, where, t, textstyle, t, and, v, displaystyle, v, are, the, kinetic, and, potential, energy, of, the, system, respectively, the, stationary, action, principle, requires, that, the, action, functional, of, the, system, derived, from, l, textstyle, l, must, remain, at, a, stationary, point, a, maximum, minimum, or, saddle, throughout, the, time, evolution, of, the, system, this, constraint, allows, the, calculation, of, the, equations, of, motion, of, the, system, using, lagrange, s, equations, hamiltonian, mechanics, emerged, in, 1833, as, a, reformulation, of, lagrangian, mechanics, introduced, by, sir, william, rowan, hamilton, hamiltonian, mechanics, replaces, generalized, velocities, q, i, displaystyle, dot, q, i, used, in, lagrangian, mechanics, with, generalized, momenta, both, theories, provide, interpretations, of, classical, mechanics, and, describe, the, same, physical, phenomena, hamiltonian, mechanics, has, a, close, relationship, with, geometry, notably, symplectic, geometry, and, poisson, structures, and, serves, as, a, link, between, classical, and, quantum, mechanics, in, this, formalism, the, dynamics, of, a, system, are, governed, by, hamilton, s, equations, which, express, the, time, derivatives, of, position, and, momentum, variables, in, terms, of, partial, derivatives, of, a, function, called, the, hamiltonian, d, q, d, t, h, p, d, p, d, t, h, q, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, q, mathrm, d, t, frac, partial, mathcal, h, partial, boldsymbol, p, quad, frac, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, p, mathrm, d, t, frac, partial, mathcal, h, partial, boldsymbol, q, the, hamiltonian, is, the, legendre, transform, of, the, lagrangian, and, in, many, situations, of, physical, interest, it, is, equal, to, the, total, energy, of, the, system, many, branches, of, classical, mechanics, are, simplifications, or, approximations, of, more, accurate, forms, two, of, the, most, accurate, being, general, relativity, and, relativistic, statistical, mechanics, geometric, optics, is, an, approximation, to, the, quantum, theory, of, light, and, does, not, have, a, superior, classical, form, when, both, quantum, mechanics, and, classical, mechanics, cannot, apply, such, as, at, the, quantum, level, with, many, degrees, of, freedom, quantum, field, theory, qft, is, of, use, qft, deals, with, small, distances, and, large, speeds, with, many, degrees, of, freedom, as, well, as, the, possibility, of, any, change, in, the, number, of, particles, throughout, the, interaction, when, treating, large, degrees, of, freedom, at, the, macroscopic, level, statistical, mechanics, becomes, useful, statistical, mechanics, describes, the, behavior, of, large, but, countable, numbers, of, particles, and, their, interactions, as, a, whole, at, the, macroscopic, level, statistical, mechanics, is, mainly, used, in, thermodynamics, for, systems, that, lie, outside, the, bounds, of, the, assumptions, of, classical, thermodynamics, in, the, case, of, high, velocity, objects, approaching, the, speed, of, light, classical, mechanics, is, enhanced, by, special, relativity, in, case, that, objects, become, extremely, heavy, i, e, their, schwarzschild, radius, is, not, negligibly, small, for, a, given, application, deviations, from, newtonian, mechanics, become, apparent, and, can, be, quantified, by, using, the, parameterized, post, newtonian, formalism, in, that, case, general, relativity, gr, becomes, applicable, however, until, now, there, is, no, theory, of, quantum, gravity, unifying, gr, and, qft, in, the, sense, that, it, could, be, used, when, objects, become, extremely, small, and, heavy, in, special, relativity, the, momentum, of, a, particle, is, given, by, where, m, is, the, particle, s, rest, mass, v, its, velocity, v, is, the, modulus, of, v, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, if, v, is, very, small, compared, to, c, v, 2, c, 2, is, approximately, zero, and, so, thus, the, newtonian, equation, p, m, v, is, an, approximation, of, the, relativistic, equation, for, bodies, moving, with, low, speeds, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, for, example, the, relativistic, cyclotron, frequency, of, a, cyclotron, gyrotron, or, high, voltage, magnetron, is, given, by, where, f, c, is, the, classical, frequency, of, an, electron, or, other, charged, particle, with, kinetic, energy, t, and, rest, mass, m, 0, circling, in, a, magnetic, field, the, rest, mass, of, an, electron, is, 511, kev, so, the, frequency, correction, is, 1, for, a, magnetic, vacuum, tube, with, a, 5, 11, kv, direct, current, accelerating, voltage, the, ray, approximation, of, classical, mechanics, breaks, down, when, the, de, broglie, wavelength, is, not, much, smaller, than, other, dimensions, of, the, system, for, non, relativistic, particles, this, wavelength, is, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, p, is, the, momentum, again, this, happens, with, electrons, before, it, happens, with, heavier, particles, for, example, the, electrons, used, by, clinton, davisson, and, lester, germer, in, 1927, accelerated, by, 54, v, had, a, wavelength, of, 0, 167, nm, which, was, long, enough, to, exhibit, a, single, diffraction, side, lobe, when, reflecting, from, the, face, of, a, nickel, crystal, with, atomic, spacing, of, 0, 215, nm, with, a, larger, vacuum, chamber, it, would, seem, relatively, easy, to, increase, the, angular, resolution, from, around, a, radian, to, a, milliradian, and, see, quantum, diffraction, from, the, periodic, patterns, of, integrated, circuit, computer, memory, more, practical, examples, of, the, failure, of, classical, mechanics, on, an, engineering, scale, are, conduction, by, quantum, tunneling, in, tunnel, diodes, and, very, narrow, transistor, gates, in, integrated, circuits, classical, mechanics, is, the, same, extreme, high, frequency, approximation, as, geometric, optics, it, is, more, often, accurate, because, it, describes, particles, and, bodies, with, rest, mass, these, have, more, momentum, and, therefore, shorter, de, broglie, wavelengths, than, massless, particles, such, as, light, with, the, same, kinetic, energies, the, study, of, the, motion, of, bodies, is, an, ancient, one, making, classical, mechanics, one, of, the, oldest, and, largest, subjects, in, science, engineering, and, technology, the, development, of, classical, mechanics, lead, to, the, development, of, many, areas, of, mathematics, 54, some, greek, philosophers, of, antiquity, among, them, aristotle, founder, of, aristotelian, physics, may, have, been, the, first, to, maintain, the, idea, that, everything, happens, for, a, reason, and, that, theoretical, principles, can, assist, in, the, understanding, of, nature, while, to, a, modern, reader, many, of, these, preserved, ideas, come, forth, as, eminently, reasonable, there, is, a, conspicuous, lack, of, both, mathematical, theory, and, controlled, experiment, as, we, know, it, these, later, became, decisive, factors, in, forming, modern, science, and, their, early, application, came, to, be, known, as, classical, mechanics, in, his, elementa, super, demonstrationem, ponderum, medieval, mathematician, jordanus, de, nemore, introduced, the, concept, of, positional, gravity, and, the, use, of, component, forces, the, first, published, causal, explanation, of, the, motions, of, planets, was, johannes, kepler, s, astronomia, nova, published, in, 1609, he, concluded, based, on, tycho, brahe, s, observations, on, the, orbit, of, mars, that, the, planet, s, orbits, were, ellipses, this, break, with, ancient, thought, was, happening, around, the, same, time, that, galileo, was, proposing, abstract, mathematical, laws, for, the, motion, of, objects, he, may, or, may, not, have, performed, the, famous, experiment, of, dropping, two, cannonballs, of, different, weights, from, the, tower, of, pisa, showing, that, they, both, hit, the, ground, at, the, same, time, the, reality, of, that, particular, experiment, is, disputed, but, he, did, carry, out, quantitative, experiments, by, rolling, balls, on, an, inclined, plane, his, theory, of, accelerated, motion, was, derived, from, the, results, of, such, experiments, and, forms, a, cornerstone, of, classical, mechanics, in, 1673, christiaan, huygens, described, in, his, horologium, oscillatorium, the, first, two, laws, of, motion, the, work, is, also, the, first, modern, treatise, in, which, a, physical, problem, the, accelerated, motion, of, a, falling, body, is, idealized, by, a, set, of, parameters, then, analyzed, mathematically, and, constitutes, one, of, the, seminal, works, of, applied, mathematics, newton, founded, his, principles, of, natural, philosophy, on, three, proposed, laws, of, motion, the, law, of, inertia, his, second, law, of, acceleration, mentioned, above, and, the, law, of, action, and, reaction, and, hence, laid, the, foundations, for, classical, mechanics, both, newton, s, second, and, third, laws, were, given, the, proper, scientific, and, mathematical, treatment, in, newton, s, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, here, they, are, distinguished, from, earlier, attempts, at, explaining, similar, phenomena, which, were, either, incomplete, incorrect, or, given, little, accurate, mathematical, expression, newton, also, enunciated, the, principles, of, conservation, of, momentum, and, angular, momentum, in, mechanics, newton, was, also, the, first, to, provide, the, first, correct, scientific, and, mathematical, formulation, of, gravity, in, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, the, combination, of, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, gravitation, provides, the, fullest, and, most, accurate, description, of, classical, mechanics, he, demonstrated, that, these, laws, apply, to, everyday, objects, as, well, as, to, celestial, objects, in, particular, he, obtained, a, theoretical, explanation, of, kepler, s, laws, of, motion, of, the, planets, newton, had, previously, invented, the, calculus, however, the, principia, was, formulated, entirely, in, terms, of, long, established, geometric, methods, in, emulation, of, euclid, newton, and, most, of, his, contemporaries, with, the, notable, exception, of, huygens, worked, on, the, assumption, that, classical, mechanics, would, be, able, to, explain, all, phenomena, including, light, in, the, form, of, geometric, optics, even, when, discovering, the, so, called, newton, s, rings, a, wave, interference, phenomenon, he, maintained, his, own, corpuscular, theory, of, light, after, newton, classical, mechanics, became, a, principal, field, of, study, in, mathematics, as, well, as, physics, mathematical, formulations, progressively, allowed, finding, solutions, to, a, far, greater, number, of, problems, the, first, notable, mathematical, treatment, was, in, 1788, by, joseph, louis, lagrange, lagrangian, mechanics, was, in, turn, re, formulated, in, 1833, by, william, rowan, hamilton, some, difficulties, were, discovered, in, the, late, 19th, century, that, could, only, be, resolved, by, more, modern, physics, some, of, these, difficulties, related, to, compatibility, with, electromagnetic, theory, and, the, famous, michelson, morley, experiment, the, resolution, of, these, problems, led, to, the, special, theory, of, relativity, often, still, considered, a, part, of, classical, mechanics, a, second, set, of, difficulties, were, related, to, thermodynamics, when, combined, with, thermodynamics, classical, mechanics, leads, to, the, gibbs, paradox, of, classical, statistical, mechanics, in, which, entropy, is, not, a, well, defined, quantity, black, body, radiation, was, not, explained, without, the, introduction, of, quanta, as, experiments, reached, the, atomic, level, classical, mechanics, failed, to, explain, even, approximately, such, basic, things, as, the, energy, levels, and, sizes, of, atoms, and, the, photo, electric, effect, the, effort, at, resolving, these, problems, led, to, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, since, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, classical, mechanics, in, physics, has, no, longer, been, an, independent, theory, instead, classical, mechanics, is, now, considered, an, approximate, theory, to, the, more, general, quantum, mechanics, emphasis, has, shifted, to, understanding, the, fundamental, forces, of, nature, as, in, the, standard, model, and, its, more, modern, extensions, into, a, unified, theory, of, everything, classical, mechanics, is, a, theory, useful, for, the, study, of, the, motion, of, non, quantum, mechanical, low, energy, particles, in, weak, gravitational, fields
