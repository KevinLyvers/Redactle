bromine, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, br, and, atomic, number, 35, it, is, a, volatile, red, brown, liquid, at, room, temperature, that, evaporates, readily, to, form, a, similarly, coloured, vapour, its, properties, are, intermediate, between, those, of, chlorine, and, iodine, isolated, independently, by, two, chemists, carl, jacob, l, wig, in, 1825, and, antoine, j, r, me, balard, in, 1826, its, name, was, derived, from, ancient, greek, bromos, stench, referring, to, its, sharp, and, pungent, smell, elemental, bromine, is, very, reactive, and, thus, does, not, occur, as, a, free, element, in, nature, instead, it, can, be, isolated, from, colourless, soluble, crystalline, mineral, halide, salts, analogous, to, table, salt, a, property, it, shares, with, the, other, halogens, while, it, is, rather, rare, in, the, earth, s, crust, the, high, solubility, of, the, bromide, ion, br, has, caused, its, accumulation, in, the, oceans, commercially, the, element, is, easily, extracted, from, brine, evaporation, ponds, mostly, in, the, united, states, and, israel, the, mass, of, bromine, in, the, oceans, is, about, one, three, hundredth, that, of, chlorine, at, standard, conditions, for, temperature, and, pressure, it, is, a, liquid, the, only, other, element, that, is, liquid, under, these, conditions, is, mercury, at, high, temperatures, organobromine, compounds, readily, dissociate, to, yield, free, bromine, atoms, a, process, that, stops, free, radical, chemical, chain, reactions, this, effect, makes, organobromine, compounds, useful, as, fire, retardants, and, more, than, half, the, bromine, produced, worldwide, each, year, is, put, to, this, purpose, the, same, property, causes, ultraviolet, sunlight, to, dissociate, volatile, organobromine, compounds, in, the, atmosphere, to, yield, free, bromine, atoms, causing, ozone, depletion, as, a, result, many, organobromine, compounds, such, as, the, pesticide, methyl, bromide, are, no, longer, used, bromine, compounds, are, still, used, in, well, drilling, fluids, in, photographic, film, and, as, an, intermediate, in, the, manufacture, of, organic, chemicals, large, amounts, of, bromide, salts, are, toxic, from, the, action, of, soluble, bromide, ions, causing, bromism, however, bromine, is, beneficial, for, human, eosinophils, and, is, an, essential, trace, element, for, collagen, development, in, all, animals, hundreds, of, known, organobromine, compounds, are, generated, by, terrestrial, and, marine, plants, and, animals, and, some, serve, important, biological, roles, as, a, pharmaceutical, the, simple, bromide, ion, br, has, inhibitory, effects, on, the, central, nervous, system, and, bromide, salts, were, once, a, major, medical, sedative, before, replacement, by, shorter, acting, drugs, they, retain, niche, uses, as, antiepileptics, bromine, was, discovered, independently, by, two, chemists, carl, jacob, l, wig, and, antoine, balard, in, 1825, and, 1826, respectively, l, wig, isolated, bromine, from, a, mineral, water, spring, from, his, hometown, bad, kreuznach, in, 1825, l, wig, used, a, solution, of, the, mineral, salt, saturated, with, chlorine, and, extracted, the, bromine, with, diethyl, ether, after, evaporation, of, the, ether, a, brown, liquid, remained, with, this, liquid, as, a, sample, of, his, work, he, applied, for, a, position, in, the, laboratory, of, leopold, gmelin, in, heidelberg, the, publication, of, the, results, was, delayed, and, balard, published, his, results, first, balard, found, bromine, chemicals, in, the, ash, of, seaweed, from, the, salt, marshes, of, montpellier, the, seaweed, was, used, to, produce, iodine, but, also, contained, bromine, balard, distilled, the, bromine, from, a, solution, of, seaweed, ash, saturated, with, chlorine, the, properties, of, the, resulting, substance, were, intermediate, between, those, of, chlorine, and, iodine, thus, he, tried, to, prove, that, the, substance, was, iodine, monochloride, icl, but, after, failing, to, do, so, he, was, sure, that, he, had, found, a, new, element, and, named, it, muride, derived, from, the, latin, word, muria, brine, after, the, french, chemists, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, louis, jacques, th, nard, and, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, approved, the, experiments, of, the, young, pharmacist, balard, the, results, were, presented, at, a, lecture, of, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, and, published, in, annales, de, chimie, et, physique, in, his, publication, balard, stated, that, he, changed, the, name, from, muride, to, br, me, on, the, proposal, of, m, anglada, the, name, br, me, bromine, derives, from, the, greek, br, mos, stench, other, sources, claim, that, the, french, chemist, and, physicist, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, suggested, the, name, br, me, for, the, characteristic, smell, of, the, vapors, bromine, was, not, produced, in, large, quantities, until, 1858, when, the, discovery, of, salt, deposits, in, stassfurt, enabled, its, production, as, a, by, product, of, potash, apart, from, some, minor, medical, applications, the, first, commercial, use, was, the, daguerreotype, in, 1840, bromine, was, discovered, to, have, some, advantages, over, the, previously, used, iodine, vapor, to, create, the, light, sensitive, silver, halide, layer, in, daguerreotypy, by, 1864, a, 25, solution, of, liquid, bromine, in, 75, molar, aqueous, potassium, bromide, was, widely, used, to, treat, gangrene, during, the, american, civil, war, before, the, publications, of, joseph, lister, and, pasteur, potassium, bromide, and, sodium, bromide, were, used, as, anticonvulsants, and, sedatives, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, but, were, gradually, superseded, by, chloral, hydrate, and, then, by, the, barbiturates, in, the, early, years, of, the, first, world, war, bromine, compounds, such, as, xylyl, bromide, were, used, as, poison, gas, bromine, is, the, third, halogen, being, a, nonmetal, in, group, 17, of, the, periodic, table, its, properties, are, thus, similar, to, those, of, fluorine, chlorine, and, iodine, and, tend, to, be, intermediate, between, those, of, the, two, neighbouring, halogens, chlorine, and, iodine, bromine, has, the, electron, configuration, 4s, 2, 3d, 10, 4p, 5, with, the, seven, electrons, in, the, fourth, and, outermost, shell, acting, as, its, valence, electrons, like, all, halogens, it, is, thus, one, electron, short, of, a, full, octet, and, is, hence, a, strong, oxidising, agent, reacting, with, many, elements, in, order, to, complete, its, outer, shell, corresponding, to, periodic, trends, it, is, intermediate, in, electronegativity, between, chlorine, and, iodine, f, 3, 98, cl, 3, 16, br, 2, 96, i, 2, 66, and, is, less, reactive, than, chlorine, and, more, reactive, than, iodine, it, is, also, a, weaker, oxidising, agent, than, chlorine, but, a, stronger, one, than, iodine, conversely, the, bromide, ion, is, a, weaker, reducing, agent, than, iodide, but, a, stronger, one, than, chloride, these, similarities, led, to, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, together, being, classified, as, one, of, the, original, triads, of, johann, wolfgang, d, bereiner, whose, work, foreshadowed, the, periodic, law, for, chemical, elements, it, is, intermediate, in, atomic, radius, between, chlorine, and, iodine, and, this, leads, to, many, of, its, atomic, properties, being, similarly, intermediate, in, value, between, chlorine, and, iodine, such, as, first, ionisation, energy, electron, affinity, enthalpy, of, dissociation, of, the, x, 2, molecule, x, cl, br, i, ionic, radius, and, x, x, bond, length, the, volatility, of, bromine, accentuates, its, very, penetrating, choking, and, unpleasant, odour, all, four, stable, halogens, experience, intermolecular, van, der, waals, forces, of, attraction, and, their, strength, increases, together, with, the, number, of, electrons, among, all, homonuclear, diatomic, halogen, molecules, thus, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, bromine, are, intermediate, between, those, of, chlorine, and, iodine, as, a, result, of, the, increasing, molecular, weight, of, the, halogens, down, the, group, the, density, and, heats, of, fusion, and, vaporisation, of, bromine, are, again, intermediate, between, those, of, chlorine, and, iodine, although, all, their, heats, of, vaporisation, are, fairly, low, leading, to, high, volatility, thanks, to, their, diatomic, molecular, structure, the, halogens, darken, in, colour, as, the, group, is, descended, fluorine, is, a, very, pale, yellow, gas, chlorine, is, greenish, yellow, and, bromine, is, a, reddish, brown, volatile, liquid, that, melts, at, 7, 2, c, and, boils, at, 58, 8, c, iodine, is, a, shiny, black, solid, this, trend, occurs, because, the, wavelengths, of, visible, light, absorbed, by, the, halogens, increase, down, the, group, specifically, the, colour, of, a, halogen, such, as, bromine, results, from, the, electron, transition, between, the, highest, occupied, antibonding, g, molecular, orbital, and, the, lowest, vacant, antibonding, u, molecular, orbital, the, colour, fades, at, low, temperatures, so, that, solid, bromine, at, 195, c, is, pale, yellow, like, solid, chlorine, and, iodine, solid, bromine, crystallises, in, the, orthorhombic, crystal, system, in, a, layered, arrangement, of, br, 2, molecules, the, br, br, distance, is, 227, pm, close, to, the, gaseous, br, br, distance, of, 228, pm, and, the, br, br, distance, between, molecules, is, 331, pm, within, a, layer, and, 399, pm, between, layers, compare, the, van, der, waals, radius, of, bromine, 195, pm, this, structure, means, that, bromine, is, a, very, poor, conductor, of, electricity, with, a, conductivity, of, around, 5, 10, 13, 1, cm, 1, just, below, the, melting, point, although, this, is, higher, than, the, essentially, undetectable, conductivity, of, chlorine, at, a, pressure, of, 55, gpa, roughly, 540, 000, times, atmospheric, pressure, bromine, undergoes, an, insulator, to, metal, transition, at, 75, gpa, it, changes, to, a, face, centered, orthorhombic, structure, at, 100, gpa, it, changes, to, a, body, centered, orthorhombic, monatomic, form, bromine, has, two, stable, isotopes, 79, br, and, 81, br, these, are, its, only, two, natural, isotopes, with, 79, br, making, up, 51, of, natural, bromine, and, 81, br, making, up, the, remaining, 49, both, have, nuclear, spin, 3, 2, and, thus, may, be, used, for, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, although, 81, br, is, more, favourable, the, relatively, 1, 1, distribution, of, the, two, isotopes, in, nature, is, helpful, in, identification, of, bromine, containing, compounds, using, mass, spectroscopy, other, bromine, isotopes, are, all, radioactive, with, half, lives, too, short, to, occur, in, nature, of, these, the, most, important, are, 80, br, t, 1, 2, 17, 7, min, 80m, br, t, 1, 2, 4, 421, h, and, 82, br, t, 1, 2, 35, 28, h, which, may, be, produced, from, the, neutron, activation, of, natural, bromine, the, most, stable, bromine, radioisotope, is, 77, br, t, 1, 2, 57, 04, h, the, primary, decay, mode, of, isotopes, lighter, than, 79, br, is, electron, capture, to, isotopes, of, selenium, that, of, isotopes, heavier, than, 81, br, is, beta, decay, to, isotopes, of, krypton, and, 80, br, may, decay, by, either, mode, to, stable, 80, se, or, 80, kr, br, isotopes, from, 87, br, and, heavier, undergo, beta, decay, with, neutron, emission, and, are, of, practical, importance, because, they, are, fission, products, bromine, is, intermediate, in, reactivity, between, chlorine, and, iodine, and, is, one, of, the, most, reactive, elements, bond, energies, to, bromine, tend, to, be, lower, than, those, to, chlorine, but, higher, than, those, to, iodine, and, bromine, is, a, weaker, oxidising, agent, than, chlorine, but, a, stronger, one, than, iodine, this, can, be, seen, from, the, standard, electrode, potentials, of, the, x, 2, x, couples, f, 2, 866, v, cl, 1, 395, v, br, 1, 087, v, i, 0, 615, v, at, approximately, 0, 3, v, bromination, often, leads, to, higher, oxidation, states, than, iodination, but, lower, or, equal, oxidation, states, to, chlorination, bromine, tends, to, react, with, compounds, including, m, m, m, h, or, m, c, bonds, to, form, m, br, bonds, the, simplest, compound, of, bromine, is, hydrogen, bromide, hbr, it, is, mainly, used, in, the, production, of, inorganic, bromides, and, alkyl, bromides, and, as, a, catalyst, for, many, reactions, in, organic, chemistry, industrially, it, is, mainly, produced, by, the, reaction, of, hydrogen, gas, with, bromine, gas, at, 200, 400, c, with, a, platinum, catalyst, however, reduction, of, bromine, with, red, phosphorus, is, a, more, practical, way, to, produce, hydrogen, bromide, in, the, laboratory, at, room, temperature, hydrogen, bromide, is, a, colourless, gas, like, all, the, hydrogen, halides, apart, from, hydrogen, fluoride, since, hydrogen, cannot, form, strong, hydrogen, bonds, to, the, large, and, only, mildly, electronegative, bromine, atom, however, weak, hydrogen, bonding, is, present, in, solid, crystalline, hydrogen, bromide, at, low, temperatures, similar, to, the, hydrogen, fluoride, structure, before, disorder, begins, to, prevail, as, the, temperature, is, raised, aqueous, hydrogen, bromide, is, known, as, hydrobromic, acid, which, is, a, strong, acid, p, k, a, 9, because, the, hydrogen, bonds, to, bromine, are, too, weak, to, inhibit, dissociation, the, hbr, h, 2, o, system, also, involves, many, hydrates, hbr, n, h, 2, o, for, n, 1, 2, 3, 4, and, 6, which, are, essentially, salts, of, bromine, anions, and, hydronium, cations, hydrobromic, acid, forms, an, azeotrope, with, boiling, point, 124, 3, c, at, 47, 63, g, hbr, per, 100, g, solution, thus, hydrobromic, acid, cannot, be, concentrated, beyond, this, point, by, distillation, unlike, hydrogen, fluoride, anhydrous, liquid, hydrogen, bromide, is, difficult, to, work, with, as, a, solvent, because, its, boiling, point, is, low, it, has, a, small, liquid, range, its, dielectric, constant, is, low, and, it, does, not, dissociate, appreciably, into, h, 2, br, and, hbr, 2, ions, the, latter, in, any, case, are, much, less, stable, than, the, bifluoride, ions, hf, 2, due, to, the, very, weak, hydrogen, bonding, between, hydrogen, and, bromine, though, its, salts, with, very, large, and, weakly, polarising, cations, such, as, cs, and, nr, 4, r, me, et, bu, n, may, still, be, isolated, anhydrous, hydrogen, bromide, is, a, poor, solvent, only, able, to, dissolve, small, molecular, compounds, such, as, nitrosyl, chloride, and, phenol, or, salts, with, very, low, lattice, energies, such, as, tetraalkylammonium, halides, nearly, all, elements, in, the, periodic, table, form, binary, bromides, the, exceptions, are, decidedly, in, the, minority, and, stem, in, each, case, from, one, of, three, causes, extreme, inertness, and, reluctance, to, participate, in, chemical, reactions, the, noble, gases, with, the, exception, of, xenon, in, the, very, unstable, xebr, 2, extreme, nuclear, instability, hampering, chemical, investigation, before, decay, and, transmutation, many, of, the, heaviest, elements, beyond, bismuth, and, having, an, electronegativity, higher, than, bromine, s, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, and, chlorine, so, that, the, resultant, binary, compounds, are, formally, not, bromides, but, rather, oxides, nitrides, fluorides, or, chlorides, of, bromine, nonetheless, nitrogen, tribromide, is, named, as, a, bromide, as, it, is, analogous, to, the, other, nitrogen, trihalides, bromination, of, metals, with, br, 2, tends, to, yield, lower, oxidation, states, than, chlorination, with, cl, 2, when, a, variety, of, oxidation, states, is, available, bromides, can, be, made, by, reaction, of, an, element, or, its, oxide, hydroxide, or, carbonate, with, hydrobromic, acid, and, then, dehydrated, by, mildly, high, temperatures, combined, with, either, low, pressure, or, anhydrous, hydrogen, bromide, gas, these, methods, work, best, when, the, bromide, product, is, stable, to, hydrolysis, otherwise, the, possibilities, include, high, temperature, oxidative, bromination, of, the, element, with, bromine, or, hydrogen, bromide, high, temperature, bromination, of, a, metal, oxide, or, other, halide, by, bromine, a, volatile, metal, bromide, carbon, tetrabromide, or, an, organic, bromide, for, example, niobium, v, oxide, reacts, with, carbon, tetrabromide, at, 370, c, to, form, niobium, v, bromide, another, method, is, halogen, exchange, in, the, presence, of, excess, halogenating, reagent, for, example, when, a, lower, bromide, is, wanted, either, a, higher, halide, may, be, reduced, using, hydrogen, or, a, metal, as, a, reducing, agent, or, thermal, decomposition, or, disproportionation, may, be, used, as, follows, most, metal, bromides, with, the, metal, in, low, oxidation, states, 1, to, 3, are, ionic, nonmetals, tend, to, form, covalent, molecular, bromides, as, do, metals, in, high, oxidation, states, from, 3, and, above, both, ionic, and, covalent, bromides, are, known, for, metals, in, oxidation, state, 3, e, g, scandium, bromide, is, mostly, ionic, but, aluminium, bromide, is, not, silver, bromide, is, very, insoluble, in, water, and, is, thus, often, used, as, a, qualitative, test, for, bromine, the, halogens, form, many, binary, diamagnetic, interhalogen, compounds, with, stoichiometries, xy, xy, 3, xy, 5, and, xy, 7, where, x, is, heavier, than, y, and, bromine, is, no, exception, bromine, forms, a, monofluoride, and, monochloride, as, well, as, a, trifluoride, and, pentafluoride, some, cationic, and, anionic, derivatives, are, also, characterised, such, as, brf, 2, brcl, 2, brf, 2, brf, 4, and, brf, 6, apart, from, these, some, pseudohalides, are, also, known, such, as, cyanogen, bromide, brcn, bromine, thiocyanate, brscn, and, bromine, azide, brn, 3, the, pale, brown, bromine, monofluoride, brf, is, unstable, at, room, temperature, disproportionating, quickly, and, irreversibly, into, bromine, bromine, trifluoride, and, bromine, pentafluoride, it, thus, cannot, be, obtained, pure, it, may, be, synthesised, by, the, direct, reaction, of, the, elements, or, by, the, comproportionation, of, bromine, and, bromine, trifluoride, at, high, temperatures, bromine, monochloride, brcl, a, red, brown, gas, quite, readily, dissociates, reversibly, into, bromine, and, chlorine, at, room, temperature, and, thus, also, cannot, be, obtained, pure, though, it, can, be, made, by, the, reversible, direct, reaction, of, its, elements, in, the, gas, phase, or, in, carbon, tetrachloride, bromine, monofluoride, in, ethanol, readily, leads, to, the, monobromination, of, the, aromatic, compounds, phx, para, bromination, occurs, for, x, me, bu, t, ome, br, meta, bromination, occurs, for, the, deactivating, x, co, 2, et, cho, no, 2, this, is, due, to, heterolytic, fission, of, the, br, f, bond, leading, to, rapid, electrophilic, bromination, by, br, at, room, temperature, bromine, trifluoride, brf, 3, is, a, straw, coloured, liquid, it, may, be, formed, by, directly, fluorinating, bromine, at, room, temperature, and, is, purified, through, distillation, it, reacts, violently, with, water, and, explodes, on, contact, with, flammable, materials, but, is, a, less, powerful, fluorinating, reagent, than, chlorine, trifluoride, it, reacts, vigorously, with, boron, carbon, silicon, arsenic, antimony, iodine, and, sulfur, to, give, fluorides, and, will, also, convert, most, metals, and, many, metal, compounds, to, fluorides, as, such, it, is, used, to, oxidise, uranium, to, uranium, hexafluoride, in, the, nuclear, power, industry, refractory, oxides, tend, to, be, only, partially, fluorinated, but, here, the, derivatives, kbrf, 4, and, brf, 2, sbf, 6, remain, reactive, bromine, trifluoride, is, a, useful, nonaqueous, ionising, solvent, since, it, readily, dissociates, to, form, brf, 2, and, brf, 4, and, thus, conducts, electricity, bromine, pentafluoride, brf, 5, was, first, synthesised, in, 1930, it, is, produced, on, a, large, scale, by, direct, reaction, of, bromine, with, excess, fluorine, at, temperatures, higher, than, 150, c, and, on, a, small, scale, by, the, fluorination, of, potassium, bromide, at, 25, c, it, also, reacts, violently, with, water, and, is, a, very, strong, fluorinating, agent, although, chlorine, trifluoride, is, still, stronger, although, dibromine, is, a, strong, oxidising, agent, with, a, high, first, ionisation, energy, very, strong, oxidisers, such, as, peroxydisulfuryl, fluoride, s, 2, o, 6, f, 2, can, oxidise, it, to, form, the, cherry, red, br, 2, cation, a, few, other, bromine, cations, are, known, namely, the, brown, br, 3, and, dark, brown, br, 5, the, tribromide, anion, br, 3, has, also, been, characterised, it, is, analogous, to, triiodide, bromine, oxides, are, not, as, well, characterised, as, chlorine, oxides, or, iodine, oxides, as, they, are, all, fairly, unstable, it, was, once, thought, that, they, could, not, exist, at, all, dibromine, monoxide, is, a, dark, brown, solid, which, while, reasonably, stable, at, 60, c, decomposes, at, its, melting, point, of, 17, 5, c, it, is, useful, in, bromination, reactions, and, may, be, made, from, the, low, temperature, decomposition, of, bromine, dioxide, in, a, vacuum, it, oxidises, iodine, to, iodine, pentoxide, and, benzene, to, 1, 4, benzoquinone, in, alkaline, solutions, it, gives, the, hypobromite, anion, so, called, bromine, dioxide, a, pale, yellow, crystalline, solid, may, be, better, formulated, as, bromine, perbromate, brobro, 3, it, is, thermally, unstable, above, 40, c, violently, decomposing, to, its, elements, at, 0, c, dibromine, trioxide, syn, brobro, 2, is, also, known, it, is, the, anhydride, of, hypobromous, acid, and, bromic, acid, it, is, an, orange, crystalline, solid, which, decomposes, above, 40, c, if, heated, too, rapidly, it, explodes, around, 0, c, a, few, other, unstable, radical, oxides, are, also, known, as, are, some, poorly, characterised, oxides, such, as, dibromine, pentoxide, tribromine, octoxide, and, bromine, trioxide, the, four, oxoacids, hypobromous, acid, hobr, bromous, acid, hobro, bromic, acid, hobro, 2, and, perbromic, acid, hobro, 3, are, better, studied, due, to, their, greater, stability, though, they, are, only, so, in, aqueous, solution, when, bromine, dissolves, in, aqueous, solution, the, following, reactions, occur, hypobromous, acid, is, unstable, to, disproportionation, the, hypobromite, ions, thus, formed, disproportionate, readily, to, give, bromide, and, bromate, bromous, acids, and, bromites, are, very, unstable, although, the, strontium, and, barium, bromites, are, known, more, important, are, the, bromates, which, are, prepared, on, a, small, scale, by, oxidation, of, bromide, by, aqueous, hypochlorite, and, are, strong, oxidising, agents, unlike, chlorates, which, very, slowly, disproportionate, to, chloride, and, perchlorate, the, bromate, anion, is, stable, to, disproportionation, in, both, acidic, and, aqueous, solutions, bromic, acid, is, a, strong, acid, bromides, and, bromates, may, comproportionate, to, bromine, as, follows, there, were, many, failed, attempts, to, obtain, perbromates, and, perbromic, acid, leading, to, some, rationalisations, as, to, why, they, should, not, exist, until, 1968, when, the, anion, was, first, synthesised, from, the, radioactive, beta, decay, of, unstable, 83, seo, 2, 4, today, perbromates, are, produced, by, the, oxidation, of, alkaline, bromate, solutions, by, fluorine, gas, excess, bromate, and, fluoride, are, precipitated, as, silver, bromate, and, calcium, fluoride, and, the, perbromic, acid, solution, may, be, purified, the, perbromate, ion, is, fairly, inert, at, room, temperature, but, is, thermodynamically, extremely, oxidising, with, extremely, strong, oxidising, agents, needed, to, produce, it, such, as, fluorine, or, xenon, difluoride, the, br, o, bond, in, bro, 4, is, fairly, weak, which, corresponds, to, the, general, reluctance, of, the, 4p, elements, arsenic, selenium, and, bromine, to, attain, their, group, oxidation, state, as, they, come, after, the, scandide, contraction, characterised, by, the, poor, shielding, afforded, by, the, radial, nodeless, 3d, orbitals, like, the, other, carbon, halogen, bonds, the, c, br, bond, is, a, common, functional, group, that, forms, part, of, core, organic, chemistry, formally, compounds, with, this, functional, group, may, be, considered, organic, derivatives, of, the, bromide, anion, due, to, the, difference, of, electronegativity, between, bromine, 2, 96, and, carbon, 2, 55, the, carbon, atom, in, a, c, br, bond, is, electron, deficient, and, thus, electrophilic, the, reactivity, of, organobromine, compounds, resembles, but, is, intermediate, between, the, reactivity, of, organochlorine, and, organoiodine, compounds, for, many, applications, organobromides, represent, a, compromise, of, reactivity, and, cost, organobromides, are, typically, produced, by, additive, or, substitutive, bromination, of, other, organic, precursors, bromine, itself, can, be, used, but, due, to, its, toxicity, and, volatility, safer, brominating, reagents, are, normally, used, such, as, n, bromosuccinimide, the, principal, reactions, for, organobromides, include, dehydrobromination, grignard, reactions, reductive, coupling, and, nucleophilic, substitution, organobromides, are, the, most, common, organohalides, in, nature, even, though, the, concentration, of, bromide, is, only, 0, 3, of, that, for, chloride, in, sea, water, because, of, the, easy, oxidation, of, bromide, to, the, equivalent, of, br, a, potent, electrophile, the, enzyme, bromoperoxidase, catalyzes, this, reaction, the, oceans, are, estimated, to, release, 1, 2, million, tons, of, bromoform, and, 56, 000, tons, of, bromomethane, annually, an, old, qualitative, test, for, the, presence, of, the, alkene, functional, group, is, that, alkenes, turn, brown, aqueous, bromine, solutions, colourless, forming, a, bromohydrin, with, some, of, the, dibromoalkane, also, produced, the, reaction, passes, through, a, short, lived, strongly, electrophilic, bromonium, intermediate, this, is, an, example, of, a, halogen, addition, reaction, bromine, is, significantly, less, abundant, in, the, crust, than, fluorine, or, chlorine, comprising, only, 2, 5, parts, per, million, of, the, earth, s, crustal, rocks, and, then, only, as, bromide, salts, it, is, the, 46th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, it, is, significantly, more, abundant, in, the, oceans, resulting, from, long, term, leaching, there, it, makes, up, 65, parts, per, million, corresponding, to, a, ratio, of, about, one, bromine, atom, for, every, 660, chlorine, atoms, salt, lakes, and, brine, wells, may, have, higher, bromine, concentrations, for, example, the, dead, sea, contains, 0, 4, bromide, ions, it, is, from, these, sources, that, bromine, extraction, is, mostly, economically, feasible, bromine, is, the, tenth, most, abundant, element, in, seawater, the, main, sources, of, bromine, production, are, israel, and, jordan, the, element, is, liberated, by, halogen, exchange, using, chlorine, gas, to, oxidise, br, to, br, 2, this, is, then, removed, with, a, blast, of, steam, or, air, and, is, then, condensed, and, purified, today, bromine, is, transported, in, large, capacity, metal, drums, or, lead, lined, tanks, that, can, hold, hundreds, of, kilograms, or, even, tonnes, of, bromine, the, bromine, industry, is, about, one, hundredth, the, size, of, the, chlorine, industry, laboratory, production, is, unnecessary, because, bromine, is, commercially, available, and, has, a, long, shelf, life, a, wide, variety, of, organobromine, compounds, are, used, in, industry, some, are, prepared, from, bromine, and, others, are, prepared, from, hydrogen, bromide, which, is, obtained, by, burning, hydrogen, in, bromine, brominated, flame, retardants, represent, a, commodity, of, growing, importance, and, make, up, the, largest, commercial, use, of, bromine, when, the, brominated, material, burns, the, flame, retardant, produces, hydrobromic, acid, which, interferes, in, the, radical, chain, reaction, of, the, oxidation, reaction, of, the, fire, the, mechanism, is, that, the, highly, reactive, hydrogen, radicals, oxygen, radicals, and, hydroxyl, radicals, react, with, hydrobromic, acid, to, form, less, reactive, bromine, radicals, i, e, free, bromine, atoms, bromine, atoms, may, also, react, directly, with, other, radicals, to, help, terminate, the, free, radical, chain, reactions, that, characterise, combustion, to, make, brominated, polymers, and, plastics, bromine, containing, compounds, can, be, incorporated, into, the, polymer, during, polymerisation, one, method, is, to, include, a, relatively, small, amount, of, brominated, monomer, during, the, polymerisation, process, for, example, vinyl, bromide, can, be, used, in, the, production, of, polyethylene, polyvinyl, chloride, or, polypropylene, specific, highly, brominated, molecules, can, also, be, added, that, participate, in, the, polymerisation, process, for, example, tetrabromobisphenol, a, can, be, added, to, polyesters, or, epoxy, resins, where, it, becomes, part, of, the, polymer, epoxies, used, in, printed, circuit, boards, are, normally, made, from, such, flame, retardant, resins, indicated, by, the, fr, in, the, abbreviation, of, the, products, fr, 4, and, fr, 2, in, some, cases, the, bromine, containing, compound, may, be, added, after, polymerisation, for, example, decabromodiphenyl, ether, can, be, added, to, the, final, polymers, a, number, of, gaseous, or, highly, volatile, brominated, halomethane, compounds, are, non, toxic, and, make, superior, fire, suppressant, agents, by, this, same, mechanism, and, are, particularly, effective, in, enclosed, spaces, such, as, submarines, airplanes, and, spacecraft, however, they, are, expensive, and, their, production, and, use, has, been, greatly, curtailed, due, to, their, effect, as, ozone, depleting, agents, they, are, no, longer, used, in, routine, fire, extinguishers, but, retain, niche, uses, in, aerospace, and, military, automatic, fire, suppression, applications, they, include, bromochloromethane, halon, 1011, ch, 2, brcl, bromochlorodifluoromethane, halon, 1211, cbrclf, 2, and, bromotrifluoromethane, halon, 1301, cbrf, 3, silver, bromide, is, used, either, alone, or, in, combination, with, silver, chloride, and, silver, iodide, as, the, light, sensitive, constituent, of, photographic, emulsions, ethylene, bromide, was, an, additive, in, gasolines, containing, lead, anti, engine, knocking, agents, it, scavenges, lead, by, forming, volatile, lead, bromide, which, is, exhausted, from, the, engine, this, application, accounted, for, 77, of, the, bromine, use, in, 1966, in, the, us, this, application, has, declined, since, the, 1970s, due, to, environmental, regulations, see, below, brominated, vegetable, oil, bvo, a, complex, mixture, of, plant, derived, triglycerides, that, have, been, reacted, to, contain, atoms, of, the, element, bromine, bonded, to, the, molecules, is, used, primarily, to, help, emulsify, citrus, flavored, soft, drinks, preventing, them, from, separating, during, distribution, poisonous, bromomethane, was, widely, used, as, pesticide, to, fumigate, soil, and, to, fumigate, housing, by, the, tenting, method, ethylene, bromide, was, similarly, used, these, volatile, organobromine, compounds, are, all, now, regulated, as, ozone, depletion, agents, the, montreal, protocol, on, substances, that, deplete, the, ozone, layer, scheduled, the, phase, out, for, the, ozone, depleting, chemical, by, 2005, and, organobromide, pesticides, are, no, longer, used, in, housing, fumigation, they, have, been, replaced, by, such, compounds, as, sulfuryl, fluoride, which, contain, neither, the, chlorine, or, bromine, organics, which, harm, ozone, before, the, montreal, protocol, in, 1991, for, example, an, estimated, 35, 000, tonnes, of, the, chemical, were, used, to, control, nematodes, fungi, weeds, and, other, soil, borne, diseases, in, pharmacology, inorganic, bromide, compounds, especially, potassium, bromide, were, frequently, used, as, general, sedatives, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, bromides, in, the, form, of, simple, salts, are, still, used, as, anticonvulsants, in, both, veterinary, and, human, medicine, although, the, latter, use, varies, from, country, to, country, for, example, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, does, not, approve, bromide, for, the, treatment, of, any, disease, and, sodium, bromide, was, removed, from, over, the, counter, sedative, products, like, bromo, seltzer, in, 1975, commercially, available, organobromine, pharmaceuticals, include, the, vasodilator, nicergoline, the, sedative, brotizolam, the, anticancer, agent, pipobroman, and, the, antiseptic, merbromin, otherwise, organobromine, compounds, are, rarely, pharmaceutically, useful, in, contrast, to, the, situation, for, organofluorine, compounds, several, drugs, are, produced, as, the, bromide, or, equivalents, hydrobromide, salts, but, in, such, cases, bromide, serves, as, an, innocuous, counterion, of, no, biological, significance, other, uses, of, organobromine, compounds, include, high, density, drilling, fluids, dyes, such, as, tyrian, purple, and, the, indicator, bromothymol, blue, and, pharmaceuticals, bromine, itself, as, well, as, some, of, its, compounds, are, used, in, water, treatment, and, is, the, precursor, of, a, variety, of, inorganic, compounds, with, an, enormous, number, of, applications, e, g, silver, bromide, for, photography, zinc, bromine, batteries, are, hybrid, flow, batteries, used, for, stationary, electrical, power, backup, and, storage, from, household, scale, to, industrial, scale, bromine, is, used, in, cooling, towers, in, place, of, chlorine, for, controlling, bacteria, algae, fungi, and, zebra, mussels, because, it, has, similar, antiseptic, qualities, to, chlorine, bromine, can, be, used, in, the, same, manner, as, chlorine, as, a, disinfectant, or, antimicrobial, in, applications, such, as, swimming, pools, bromine, came, into, this, use, in, the, united, states, during, world, war, ii, due, to, a, predicted, shortage, of, chlorine, however, bromine, is, usually, not, used, outside, for, these, applications, due, to, it, being, relatively, more, expensive, than, chlorine, and, the, absence, of, a, stabilizer, to, protect, it, from, the, sun, for, indoor, pools, it, can, be, a, good, option, as, it, is, effective, at, a, wider, ph, range, it, is, also, more, stable, in, a, heated, pool, or, hot, tub, a, 2014, study, suggests, that, bromine, in, the, form, of, bromide, ion, is, a, necessary, cofactor, in, the, biosynthesis, of, collagen, iv, making, the, element, essential, to, basement, membrane, architecture, and, tissue, development, in, animals, nevertheless, no, clear, deprivation, symptoms, or, syndromes, have, been, documented, in, mammals, in, other, biological, functions, bromine, may, be, non, essential, but, still, beneficial, when, it, takes, the, place, of, chlorine, for, example, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, formed, by, the, eosinophil, and, either, chloride, iodide, thiocyanate, or, bromide, ions, eosinophil, peroxidase, provides, a, potent, mechanism, by, which, eosinophils, kill, multicellular, parasites, such, as, the, nematode, worms, involved, in, filariasis, and, some, bacteria, such, as, tuberculosis, bacteria, eosinophil, peroxidase, is, a, haloperoxidase, that, preferentially, uses, bromide, over, chloride, for, this, purpose, generating, hypobromite, hypobromous, acid, although, the, use, of, chloride, is, possible, haloesters, are, generally, thought, of, as, highly, reactive, and, consequently, toxic, intermediates, in, organic, synthesis, nevertheless, mammals, including, humans, cats, and, rats, appear, to, biosynthesize, traces, of, an, bromoester, 2, octyl, 4, bromo, 3, oxobutanoate, which, is, found, in, their, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, appears, to, play, a, yet, unclarified, role, in, inducing, rem, sleep, neutrophil, myeloperoxidase, can, use, h, 2, o, 2, and, br, to, brominate, deoxycytidine, which, could, result, in, dna, mutations, marine, organisms, are, the, main, source, of, organobromine, compounds, and, it, is, in, these, organisms, that, bromine, is, more, firmly, shown, to, be, essential, more, than, 1600, such, organobromine, compounds, were, identified, by, 1999, the, most, abundant, is, methyl, bromide, ch, 3, br, of, which, an, estimated, 56, 000, tonnes, is, produced, by, marine, algae, each, year, the, essential, oil, of, the, hawaiian, alga, asparagopsis, taxiformis, consists, of, 80, bromoform, most, of, such, organobromine, compounds, in, the, sea, are, made, by, the, action, of, a, unique, algal, enzyme, vanadium, bromoperoxidase, the, bromide, anion, is, not, very, toxic, a, normal, daily, intake, is, 2, to, 8, milligrams, however, high, levels, of, bromide, chronically, impair, the, membrane, of, neurons, which, progressively, impairs, neuronal, transmission, leading, to, toxicity, known, as, bromism, bromide, has, an, elimination, half, life, of, 9, to, 12, days, which, can, lead, to, excessive, accumulation, doses, of, 0, 5, to, 1, gram, per, day, of, bromide, can, lead, to, bromism, historically, the, therapeutic, dose, of, bromide, is, about, 3, to, 5, grams, of, bromide, thus, explaining, why, chronic, toxicity, bromism, was, once, so, common, while, significant, and, sometimes, serious, disturbances, occur, to, neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and, gastrointestinal, functions, death, from, bromism, is, rare, bromism, is, caused, by, a, neurotoxic, effect, on, the, brain, which, results, in, somnolence, psychosis, seizures, and, delirium, elemental, bromine, br, 2, is, toxic, and, causes, chemical, burns, on, human, flesh, inhaling, bromine, gas, results, in, similar, irritation, of, the, respiratory, tract, causing, coughing, choking, shortness, of, breath, and, death, if, inhaled, in, large, enough, amounts, chronic, exposure, may, lead, to, frequent, bronchial, infections, and, a, general, deterioration, of, health, as, a, strong, oxidising, agent, bromine, is, incompatible, with, most, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, caution, is, required, when, transporting, bromine, it, is, commonly, carried, in, steel, tanks, lined, with, lead, supported, by, strong, metal, frames, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, of, the, united, states, has, set, a, permissible, exposure, limit, pel, for, bromine, at, a, time, weighted, average, twa, of, 0, 1, ppm, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, twa, 0, 1, ppm, and, a, short, term, limit, of, 0, 3, ppm, the, exposure, to, bromine, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, idlh, is, 3, ppm, bromine, is, classified, as, an, extremely, hazardous, substance, in, the, united, states, as, defined, in, section, 302, of, the, u, s, emergency, planning, and, community,
