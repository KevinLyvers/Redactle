measurement, is, the, quantification, of, attributes, of, an, object, or, event, which, can, be, used, to, compare, with, other, objects, or, events, in, other, words, measurement, is, a, process, of, determining, how, large, or, small, a, physical, quantity, is, as, compared, to, a, basic, reference, quantity, of, the, same, kind, the, scope, and, application, of, measurement, are, dependent, on, the, context, and, discipline, in, natural, sciences, and, engineering, measurements, do, not, apply, to, nominal, properties, of, objects, or, events, which, is, consistent, with, the, guidelines, of, the, international, vocabulary, of, metrology, published, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, however, in, other, fields, such, as, statistics, as, well, as, the, social, and, behavioural, sciences, measurements, can, have, multiple, levels, which, would, include, nominal, ordinal, interval, and, ratio, scales, measurement, is, a, cornerstone, of, trade, science, technology, and, quantitative, research, in, many, disciplines, historically, many, measurement, systems, existed, for, the, varied, fields, of, human, existence, to, facilitate, comparisons, in, these, fields, often, these, were, achieved, by, local, agreements, between, trading, partners, or, collaborators, since, the, 18th, century, developments, progressed, towards, unifying, widely, accepted, standards, that, resulted, in, the, modern, international, system, of, units, si, this, system, reduces, all, physical, measurements, to, a, mathematical, combination, of, seven, base, units, the, science, of, measurement, is, pursued, in, the, field, of, metrology, measurement, is, defined, as, the, process, of, comparison, of, an, unknown, quantity, with, a, known, or, standard, quantity, the, measurement, of, a, property, may, be, categorized, by, the, following, criteria, type, magnitude, unit, and, uncertainty, they, enable, unambiguous, comparisons, between, measurements, measurements, most, commonly, use, the, international, system, of, units, si, as, a, comparison, framework, the, system, defines, seven, fundamental, units, kilogram, metre, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and, mole, all, of, these, units, are, defined, without, reference, to, a, particular, physical, object, which, serves, as, a, standard, artifact, free, definitions, fix, measurements, at, an, exact, value, related, to, a, physical, constant, or, other, invariable, phenomena, in, nature, in, contrast, to, standard, artifacts, which, are, subject, to, deterioration, or, destruction, instead, the, measurement, unit, can, only, ever, change, through, increased, accuracy, in, determining, the, value, of, the, constant, it, is, tied, to, the, first, proposal, to, tie, an, si, base, unit, to, an, experimental, standard, independent, of, fiat, was, by, charles, sanders, peirce, 1839, 1914, who, proposed, to, define, the, metre, in, terms, of, the, wavelength, of, a, spectral, line, this, directly, influenced, the, michelson, morley, experiment, michelson, and, morley, cite, peirce, and, improve, on, his, method, with, the, exception, of, a, few, fundamental, quantum, constants, units, of, measurement, are, derived, from, historical, agreements, nothing, inherent, in, nature, dictates, that, an, inch, has, to, be, a, certain, length, nor, that, a, mile, is, a, better, measure, of, distance, than, a, kilometre, over, the, course, of, human, history, however, first, for, convenience, and, then, for, necessity, standards, of, measurement, evolved, so, that, communities, would, have, certain, common, benchmarks, laws, regulating, measurement, were, originally, developed, to, prevent, fraud, in, commerce, units, of, measurement, are, generally, defined, on, a, scientific, basis, overseen, by, governmental, or, independent, agencies, and, established, in, international, treaties, pre, eminent, of, which, is, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, established, in, 1875, by, the, metre, convention, overseeing, the, international, system, of, units, si, for, example, the, metre, was, redefined, in, 1983, by, the, cgpm, in, terms, of, the, speed, of, light, the, kilogram, was, redefined, in, 2019, in, terms, of, the, planck, constant, and, the, international, yard, was, defined, in, 1960, by, the, governments, of, the, united, states, united, kingdom, australia, and, south, africa, as, being, exactly, 0, 9144, metres, in, the, united, states, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, a, division, of, the, united, states, department, of, commerce, regulates, commercial, measurements, in, the, united, kingdom, the, role, is, performed, by, the, national, physical, laboratory, npl, in, australia, by, the, national, measurement, institute, in, south, africa, by, the, council, for, scientific, and, industrial, research, and, in, india, the, national, physical, laboratory, of, india, unit, is, known, or, standard, quantity, in, terms, of, which, other, physical, quantities, are, measured, before, si, units, were, widely, adopted, around, the, world, the, british, systems, of, english, units, and, later, imperial, units, were, used, in, britain, the, commonwealth, and, the, united, states, the, system, came, to, be, known, as, u, s, customary, units, in, the, united, states, and, is, still, in, use, there, and, in, a, few, caribbean, countries, these, various, systems, of, measurement, have, at, times, been, called, foot, pound, second, systems, after, the, imperial, units, for, length, weight, and, time, even, though, the, tons, hundredweights, gallons, and, nautical, miles, for, example, are, different, for, the, u, s, units, many, imperial, units, remain, in, use, in, britain, which, has, officially, switched, to, the, si, system, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, road, signs, which, are, still, in, miles, draught, beer, and, cider, must, be, sold, by, the, imperial, pint, and, milk, in, returnable, bottles, can, be, sold, by, the, imperial, pint, many, people, measure, their, height, in, feet, and, inches, and, their, weight, in, stone, and, pounds, to, give, just, a, few, examples, imperial, units, are, used, in, many, other, places, for, example, in, many, commonwealth, countries, that, are, considered, metricated, land, area, is, measured, in, acres, and, floor, space, in, square, feet, particularly, for, commercial, transactions, rather, than, government, statistics, similarly, gasoline, is, sold, by, the, gallon, in, many, countries, that, are, considered, metricated, the, metric, system, is, a, decimal, system, of, measurement, based, on, its, units, for, length, the, metre, and, for, mass, the, kilogram, it, exists, in, several, variations, with, different, choices, of, base, units, though, these, do, not, affect, its, day, to, day, use, since, the, 1960s, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, the, internationally, recognised, metric, system, metric, units, of, mass, length, and, electricity, are, widely, used, around, the, world, for, both, everyday, and, scientific, purposes, the, international, system, of, units, abbreviated, as, si, from, the, french, language, name, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, is, the, modern, revision, of, the, metric, system, it, is, the, world, s, most, widely, used, system, of, units, both, in, everyday, commerce, and, in, science, the, si, was, developed, in, 1960, from, the, metre, kilogram, second, mks, system, rather, than, the, centimetre, gram, second, cgs, system, which, in, turn, had, many, variants, the, si, units, for, the, seven, base, physical, quantities, are, in, the, si, base, units, are, the, simple, measurements, for, time, length, mass, temperature, amount, of, substance, electric, current, and, light, intensity, derived, units, are, constructed, from, the, base, units, for, example, the, watt, i, e, the, unit, for, power, is, defined, from, the, base, units, as, m, 2, kg, s, 3, other, physical, properties, may, be, measured, in, compound, units, such, as, material, density, measured, in, kg, m, 3, the, si, allows, easy, multiplication, when, switching, among, units, having, the, same, base, but, different, prefixes, to, convert, from, metres, to, centimetres, it, is, only, necessary, to, multiply, the, number, of, metres, by, 100, since, there, are, 100, centimetres, in, a, metre, inversely, to, switch, from, centimetres, to, metres, one, multiplies, the, number, of, centimetres, by, 0, 01, or, divides, the, number, of, centimetres, by, 100, a, ruler, or, rule, is, a, tool, used, in, for, example, geometry, technical, drawing, engineering, and, carpentry, to, measure, lengths, or, distances, or, to, draw, straight, lines, strictly, speaking, the, ruler, is, the, instrument, used, to, rule, straight, lines, and, the, calibrated, instrument, used, for, determining, length, is, called, a, measure, however, common, usage, calls, both, instruments, rulers, and, the, special, name, straightedge, is, used, for, an, unmarked, rule, the, use, of, the, word, measure, in, the, sense, of, a, measuring, instrument, only, survives, in, the, phrase, tape, measure, an, instrument, that, can, be, used, to, measure, but, cannot, be, used, to, draw, straight, lines, as, can, be, seen, in, the, photographs, on, this, page, a, two, metre, carpenter, s, rule, can, be, folded, down, to, a, length, of, only, 20, centimetres, to, easily, fit, in, a, pocket, and, a, five, metre, long, tape, measure, easily, retracts, to, fit, within, a, small, housing, time, is, an, abstract, measurement, of, elemental, changes, over, a, non, spatial, continuum, it, is, denoted, by, numbers, and, or, named, periods, such, as, hours, days, weeks, months, and, years, it, is, an, apparently, irreversible, series, of, occurrences, within, this, non, spatial, continuum, it, is, also, used, to, denote, an, interval, between, two, relative, points, on, this, continuum, mass, refers, to, the, intrinsic, property, of, all, material, objects, to, resist, changes, in, their, momentum, weight, on, the, other, hand, refers, to, the, downward, force, produced, when, a, mass, is, in, a, gravitational, field, in, free, fall, no, net, gravitational, forces, objects, lack, weight, but, retain, their, mass, the, imperial, units, of, mass, include, the, ounce, pound, and, ton, the, metric, units, gram, and, kilogram, are, units, of, mass, one, device, for, measuring, weight, or, mass, is, called, a, weighing, scale, or, often, simply, a, scale, a, spring, scale, measures, force, but, not, mass, a, balance, compares, weight, both, require, a, gravitational, field, to, operate, some, of, the, most, accurate, instruments, for, measuring, weight, or, mass, are, based, on, load, cells, with, a, digital, read, out, but, require, a, gravitational, field, to, function, and, would, not, work, in, free, fall, the, measures, used, in, economics, are, physical, measures, nominal, price, value, measures, and, real, price, measures, these, measures, differ, from, one, another, by, the, variables, they, measure, and, by, the, variables, excluded, from, measurements, in, the, field, of, survey, research, measures, are, taken, from, individual, attitudes, values, and, behavior, using, questionnaires, as, a, measurement, instrument, as, all, other, measurements, measurement, in, survey, research, is, also, vulnerable, to, measurement, error, i, e, the, departure, from, the, true, value, of, the, measurement, and, the, value, provided, using, the, measurement, instrument, in, substantive, survey, research, measurement, error, can, lead, to, biased, conclusions, and, wrongly, estimated, effects, in, order, to, get, accurate, results, when, measurement, errors, appear, the, results, need, to, be, corrected, for, measurement, errors, the, following, rules, generally, apply, for, displaying, the, exactness, of, measurements, since, accurate, measurement, is, essential, in, many, fields, and, since, all, measurements, are, necessarily, approximations, a, great, deal, of, effort, must, be, taken, to, make, measurements, as, accurate, as, possible, for, example, consider, the, problem, of, measuring, the, time, it, takes, an, object, to, fall, a, distance, of, one, metre, about, 39, in, using, physics, it, can, be, shown, that, in, the, gravitational, field, of, the, earth, it, should, take, any, object, about, 0, 45, second, to, fall, one, metre, however, the, following, are, just, some, of, the, sources, of, error, that, arise, additionally, other, sources, of, experimental, error, include, scientific, experiments, must, be, carried, out, with, great, care, to, eliminate, as, much, error, as, possible, and, to, keep, error, estimates, realistic, in, the, classical, definition, which, is, standard, throughout, the, physical, sciences, measurement, is, the, determination, or, estimation, of, ratios, of, quantities, quantity, and, measurement, are, mutually, defined, quantitative, attributes, are, those, possible, to, measure, at, least, in, principle, the, classical, concept, of, quantity, can, be, traced, back, to, john, wallis, and, isaac, newton, and, was, foreshadowed, in, euclid, s, elements, in, the, representational, theory, measurement, is, defined, as, the, correlation, of, numbers, with, entities, that, are, not, numbers, the, most, technically, elaborated, form, of, representational, theory, is, also, known, as, additive, conjoint, measurement, in, this, form, of, representational, theory, numbers, are, assigned, based, on, correspondences, or, similarities, between, the, structure, of, number, systems, and, the, structure, of, qualitative, systems, a, property, is, quantitative, if, such, structural, similarities, can, be, established, in, weaker, forms, of, representational, theory, such, as, that, implicit, within, the, work, of, stanley, smith, stevens, numbers, need, only, be, assigned, according, to, a, rule, the, concept, of, measurement, is, often, misunderstood, as, merely, the, assignment, of, a, value, but, it, is, possible, to, assign, a, value, in, a, way, that, is, not, a, measurement, in, terms, of, the, requirements, of, additive, conjoint, measurement, one, may, assign, a, value, to, a, person, s, height, but, unless, it, can, be, established, that, there, is, a, correlation, between, measurements, of, height, and, empirical, relations, it, is, not, a, measurement, according, to, additive, conjoint, measurement, theory, likewise, computing, and, assigning, arbitrary, values, like, the, book, value, of, an, asset, in, accounting, is, not, a, measurement, because, it, does, not, satisfy, the, necessary, criteria, three, type, of, representational, theory, all, data, are, inexact, and, statistical, in, nature, thus, the, definition, of, measurement, is, a, set, of, observations, that, reduce, uncertainty, where, the, result, is, expressed, as, a, quantity, this, definition, is, implied, in, what, scientists, actually, do, when, they, measure, something, and, report, both, the, mean, and, statistics, of, the, measurements, in, practical, terms, one, begins, with, an, initial, guess, as, to, the, expected, value, of, a, quantity, and, then, using, various, methods, and, instruments, reduces, the, uncertainty, in, the, value, in, this, view, unlike, the, positivist, representational, theory, all, measurements, are, uncertain, so, instead, of, assigning, one, value, a, range, of, values, is, assigned, to, a, measurement, this, also, implies, that, there, is, not, a, clear, or, neat, distinction, between, estimation, and, measurement, in, quantum, mechanics, a, measurement, is, an, action, that, determines, a, particular, property, position, momentum, energy, etc, of, a, quantum, system, quantum, measurements, are, always, statistical, samples, from, a, probability, distribution, the, distribution, for, many, quantum, phenomena, is, discrete, 197, quantum, measurements, alter, quantum, states, and, yet, repeated, measurements, on, a, quantum, state, are, reproducible, the, measurement, appears, to, act, as, a, filter, changing, the, quantum, state, into, one, with, the, single, measured, quantum, value, the, unambiguous, meaning, of, the, quantum, measurement, is, an, unresolved, fundamental, problem, in, quantum, mechanics, the, most, common, interpretation, is, that, when, a, measurement, is, performed, the, wavefunction, of, the, quantum, system, collapses, to, a, single, definite, value, in, biology, there, is, generally, no, well, established, theory, of, measurement, however, the, importance, of, the, theoretical, context, is, emphasized, moreover, the, theoretical, context, stemming, from, the, theory, of, evolution, leads, to, articulate, the, theory, of, measurement, and, historicity, as, a, fundamental, notion, among, the, most, developed, fields, of, measurement, in, biology, are, the, measurement, of, genetic, diversity, and, species, diversity
