nitrate, is, a, polyatomic, ion, with, the, chemical, formula, no, 3, salts, containing, this, ion, are, called, nitrates, nitrates, are, common, components, of, fertilizers, and, explosives, almost, all, inorganic, nitrates, are, soluble, in, water, an, example, of, an, insoluble, nitrate, is, bismuth, oxynitrate, the, nitrate, anion, is, the, conjugate, base, of, nitric, acid, consisting, of, one, central, nitrogen, atom, surrounded, by, three, identically, bonded, oxygen, atoms, in, a, trigonal, planar, arrangement, the, nitrate, ion, carries, a, formal, charge, of, 1, this, charge, results, from, a, combination, formal, charge, in, which, each, of, the, three, oxygens, carries, a, 2, 3, charge, whereas, the, nitrogen, carries, a, 1, charge, all, these, adding, up, to, formal, charge, of, the, polyatomic, nitrate, ion, this, arrangement, is, commonly, used, as, an, example, of, resonance, like, the, isoelectronic, carbonate, ion, the, nitrate, ion, can, be, represented, by, three, resonance, structures, in, the, no, 3, anion, the, oxidation, state, of, the, central, nitrogen, atom, is, v, 5, this, corresponds, to, the, highest, possible, oxidation, number, of, nitrogen, nitrate, is, a, potentially, powerful, oxidizer, as, evidenced, by, its, explosive, behaviour, at, high, temperature, when, it, is, detonated, in, ammonium, nitrate, nh, 4, no, 3, or, black, powder, ignited, by, the, shock, wave, of, a, primary, explosive, however, in, contrast, to, red, fuming, nitric, acid, hno, 3, n, 2, o, 4, or, concentrated, nitric, acid, hno, 3, nitrate, dissolved, in, aqueous, solution, at, neutral, or, high, ph, is, only, a, weak, oxidizing, agent, and, is, stable, under, sterile, or, aseptic, conditions, in, the, absence, of, microorganisms, to, increase, its, oxidation, power, acidic, conditions, and, high, concentrations, are, needed, under, which, nitrate, transforms, into, nitric, acid, this, behaviour, is, consistent, with, the, general, theory, of, reduction, oxidation, redox, in, electrochemistry, oxidizing, power, is, exacerbated, under, acidic, conditions, while, the, power, of, reducing, agents, is, reinforced, under, basic, conditions, this, can, be, illustrated, by, means, of, a, pourbaix, diagram, e, h, ph, diagram, drawn, using, the, nernst, equation, and, the, corresponding, redox, reactions, during, the, reduction, of, oxidizers, the, oxidation, state, decreases, and, oxide, ions, o, 2, in, excess, released, in, water, by, the, reaction, are, more, easily, protonated, under, acid, conditions, o, 2, 2, h, h, 2, o, which, drives, the, reduction, reaction, to, the, right, according, to, le, chatelier, s, principle, for, the, oxidation, of, reducing, agents, the, reverse, occurs, as, the, oxidation, state, increases, oxide, anions, are, needed, to, neutralise, the, surplus, of, positive, charges, born, by, the, central, atom, as, basic, conditions, favor, the, production, of, oxide, anions, 2, oh, o, 2, h, 2, o, this, drives, the, chemical, equilibrium, of, the, oxidation, reaction, to, the, right, meanwhile, nitrate, is, used, as, a, powerful, terminal, electron, acceptor, by, denitrifying, bacteria, to, deliver, the, energy, they, need, to, thrive, under, anaerobic, conditions, nitrate, is, the, strongest, electron, acceptor, used, by, prokaryote, microorganisms, bacteria, and, archaea, to, respirate, the, redox, couple, no, 3, n, 2, is, at, the, top, of, the, redox, scale, for, the, anaerobic, respiration, just, below, the, couple, oxygen, o, 2, h, 2, o, but, above, the, couples, mn, iv, mn, ii, fe, iii, fe, ii, so, 2, 4, hs, co, 2, ch, 4, in, natural, waters, inevitably, contaminated, by, microorganisms, nitrate, is, a, quite, unstable, and, labile, dissolved, chemical, species, because, it, is, metabolised, by, denitrifying, bacteria, water, samples, for, nitrate, nitrite, analyses, need, to, be, kept, at, 4, c, in, a, refrigerated, room, and, analysed, as, quick, as, possible, to, limit, the, loss, of, nitrate, in, the, first, step, of, the, denitrification, process, dissolved, nitrate, no, 3, is, catalytically, reduced, into, nitrite, no, 2, by, the, enzymatic, activity, of, bacteria, in, aqueous, solution, dissolved, nitrite, n, iii, is, a, more, powerful, oxidizer, that, nitrate, n, v, because, it, has, to, accept, less, electrons, and, its, reduction, is, less, kinetically, hindered, than, that, of, nitrate, during, the, biological, denitrification, process, further, nitrite, reduction, also, gives, rise, to, another, powerful, oxidizing, agent, nitric, oxide, no, no, can, fix, on, myoglobin, accentuating, its, red, coloration, no, is, an, important, biological, signaling, molecule, and, intervenes, in, the, vasodilation, process, but, it, can, also, produce, free, radicals, in, biological, tissues, accelerating, their, degradation, and, aging, process, the, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, generated, by, no, contribute, to, the, oxidative, stress, a, condition, involved, in, vascular, dysfunction, and, atherogenesis, the, nitrate, anion, is, commonly, analysed, in, water, by, ion, chromatography, ic, along, with, other, anions, also, present, in, solution, the, main, advantage, of, ic, is, its, ease, and, the, simultaneous, analysis, of, all, the, anions, present, in, the, aqueous, sample, other, methods, for, the, specific, detection, of, nitrate, rely, on, its, conversion, to, nitrite, followed, by, nitrite, specific, tests, the, reduction, of, nitrate, to, nitrite, is, effected, by, a, copper, cadmium, material, the, sample, is, introduced, in, a, flow, injection, analyzer, and, the, resulting, nitrite, containing, effluent, is, then, combined, with, a, reagent, for, colorimetric, or, electrochemical, detection, the, most, popular, of, these, assays, is, the, griess, test, whereby, nitrite, is, converted, to, a, deeply, colored, azo, dye, suited, for, uv, vis, spectroscopic, analysis, the, method, exploits, the, reactivity, of, nitrous, acid, derived, from, acidification, of, nitrite, nitrous, acid, selectively, reacts, with, aromatic, amines, to, give, diazonium, salts, which, in, turn, couple, with, a, second, reagent, to, give, the, azo, dye, the, detection, limit, is, 0, 02, to, 2, m, such, methods, have, been, highly, adapted, to, biological, samples, nitrate, salts, are, found, naturally, on, earth, in, arid, environments, as, large, deposits, particularly, of, nitratine, a, major, source, of, sodium, nitrate, nitrates, are, produced, by, a, number, of, species, of, nitrifying, bacteria, in, the, natural, environment, using, ammonia, or, urea, as, a, source, of, nitrogen, and, source, of, free, energy, nitrate, compounds, for, gunpowder, were, historically, produced, in, the, absence, of, mineral, nitrate, sources, by, means, of, various, fermentation, processes, using, urine, and, dung, lightning, strikes, in, earth, s, nitrogen, and, oxygen, rich, atmosphere, produce, a, mixture, of, oxides, of, nitrogen, which, form, nitrous, ions, and, nitrate, ions, which, are, washed, from, the, atmosphere, by, rain, or, in, occult, deposition, nitrates, are, produced, industrially, from, nitric, acid, nitrate, is, a, chemical, compound, that, serves, as, a, primary, form, of, nitrogen, for, many, plants, this, essential, nutrient, is, used, by, plants, to, synthesize, proteins, nucleic, acids, and, other, vital, organic, molecules, the, transformation, of, atmospheric, nitrogen, into, nitrate, is, facilitated, by, certain, bacteria, and, lightning, in, the, nitrogen, cycle, which, exemplifies, nature, s, ability, to, convert, a, relatively, inert, molecule, into, a, form, that, is, crucial, for, biological, productivity, nitrates, are, used, as, fertilizers, in, agriculture, because, of, their, high, solubility, and, biodegradability, the, main, nitrate, fertilizers, are, ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and, magnesium, salts, several, billion, kilograms, are, produced, annually, for, this, purpose, the, significance, of, nitrate, extends, beyond, its, role, as, a, nutrient, since, it, acts, as, a, signaling, molecule, in, plants, regulating, processes, such, as, root, growth, flowering, and, leaf, development, while, nitrate, is, beneficial, for, agriculture, since, it, enhances, soil, fertility, and, crop, yields, its, excessive, use, can, lead, to, nutrient, runoff, water, pollution, and, the, proliferation, of, aquatic, dead, zones, therefore, sustainable, agricultural, practices, that, balance, productivity, with, environmental, stewardship, are, necessary, nitrate, s, importance, in, ecosystems, is, evident, since, it, supports, the, growth, and, development, of, plants, contributing, to, biodiversity, and, ecological, balance, nitrates, are, used, as, oxidizing, agents, most, notably, in, explosives, where, the, rapid, oxidation, of, carbon, compounds, liberates, large, volumes, of, gases, see, gunpowder, as, an, example, sodium, nitrate, is, used, to, remove, air, bubbles, from, molten, glass, and, some, ceramics, mixtures, of, molten, salts, are, used, to, harden, the, surface, of, some, metals, nitrate, was, also, used, as, a, film, stock, through, nitrocellulose, due, to, its, high, combustibility, the, film, making, studios, swapped, to, cellulose, acetate, safety, film, in, 1950, in, the, medical, field, nitrate, derived, organic, esters, such, as, glyceryl, trinitrate, isosorbide, dinitrate, and, isosorbide, mononitrate, are, used, in, the, prophylaxis, and, management, of, acute, coronary, syndrome, myocardial, infarction, acute, pulmonary, oedema, this, class, of, drug, to, which, amyl, nitrite, also, belongs, is, known, as, nitrovasodilators, the, two, areas, of, concerns, about, the, toxicity, of, nitrate, are, the, following, one, of, the, most, common, cause, of, methemoglobinemia, in, infants, is, due, to, the, ingestion, of, nitrates, and, nitrites, through, well, water, or, foods, in, fact, nitrates, no, 3, often, present, at, too, high, concentration, in, drinkwater, are, only, the, precursor, chemical, species, of, nitrites, no, 2, the, real, culprits, of, methemoglobinemia, nitrites, produced, by, the, microbial, reduction, of, nitrate, directly, in, the, drinkwater, or, after, ingestion, by, the, infant, in, his, digestive, system, are, more, powerful, oxidizers, than, nitrates, and, are, the, chemical, agent, really, responsible, for, the, oxidation, of, fe, 2, into, fe, 3, in, the, tetrapyrrole, heme, of, hemoglobin, indeed, nitrate, anions, are, too, weak, oxidizers, in, aqueous, solution, to, be, able, to, directly, or, at, least, sufficiently, rapidly, oxidize, fe, 2, into, fe, 3, because, of, kinetics, limitations, infants, younger, than, 4, months, are, at, greater, risk, given, that, they, drink, more, water, per, body, weight, they, have, a, lower, nadh, cytochrome, b5, reductase, activity, and, they, have, a, higher, level, of, fetal, hemoglobin, which, converts, more, easily, to, methemoglobin, additionally, infants, are, at, an, increased, risk, after, an, episode, of, gastroenteritis, due, to, the, production, of, nitrites, by, bacteria, however, other, causes, than, nitrates, can, also, affect, infants, and, pregnant, women, indeed, the, blue, baby, syndrome, can, also, be, caused, by, a, number, of, other, factors, such, as, the, cyanotic, heart, disease, a, congenital, heart, defect, resulting, in, low, levels, of, oxygen, in, the, blood, or, by, gastric, upset, such, as, diarrheal, infection, protein, intolerance, heavy, metal, toxicity, etc, through, the, safe, drinking, water, act, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, has, set, a, maximum, contaminant, level, of, 10, mg, l, or, 10, ppm, of, nitrate, in, drinking, water, an, acceptable, daily, intake, adi, for, nitrate, ions, was, established, in, the, range, of, 0, 3, 7, mg, kg, body, weight, 1, day, 1, by, the, joint, fao, who, expert, committee, on, food, additives, jefca, in, freshwater, or, estuarine, systems, close, to, land, nitrate, can, reach, concentrations, that, are, lethal, to, fish, while, nitrate, is, much, less, toxic, than, ammonia, levels, over, 30, ppm, of, nitrate, can, inhibit, growth, impair, the, immune, system, and, cause, stress, in, some, aquatic, species, nitrate, toxicity, remains, a, subject, of, debate, in, most, cases, of, excess, nitrate, concentrations, in, aquatic, systems, the, primary, sources, are, wastewater, discharges, as, well, as, surface, runoff, from, agricultural, or, landscaped, areas, that, have, received, excess, nitrate, fertilizer, the, resulting, eutrophication, and, algae, blooms, result, in, anoxia, and, dead, zones, as, a, consequence, as, nitrate, forms, a, component, of, total, dissolved, solids, they, are, widely, used, as, an, indicator, of, water, quality, nitrate, deposition, into, ecosystems, has, markedly, increased, due, to, anthropogenic, activities, notably, from, the, widespread, application, of, nitrogen, rich, fertilizers, in, agriculture, and, the, emissions, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, annually, about, 195, million, metric, tons, of, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizers, are, used, worldwide, with, nitrates, constituting, a, significant, portion, of, this, amount, in, regions, with, intensive, agriculture, such, as, parts, of, the, u, s, china, and, india, the, use, of, nitrogen, fertilizers, can, exceed, 200, kilograms, per, hectare, the, impact, of, increased, nitrate, deposition, extends, beyond, plant, communities, to, affect, soil, microbial, populations, the, change, in, soil, chemistry, and, nutrient, dynamics, can, disrupt, the, natural, processes, of, nitrogen, fixation, nitrification, and, denitrification, leading, to, altered, microbial, community, structures, and, functions, this, disruption, can, further, impact, the, nutrient, cycling, and, overall, ecosystem, health, a, source, of, nitrate, in, the, human, diets, arises, from, the, consumption, of, leafy, green, foods, such, as, spinach, and, arugula, no, 3, can, be, present, in, beetroot, juice, drinking, water, represents, also, a, primary, nitrate, intake, source, nitrate, ingestion, rapidly, increases, the, plasma, nitrate, concentration, by, a, factor, of, 2, to, 3, and, this, elevated, nitrate, concentration, can, be, maintained, for, more, than, 2, weeks, increased, plasma, nitrate, enhances, the, production, of, nitric, oxide, no, nitric, oxide, is, a, physiological, signaling, molecule, which, intervenes, in, among, other, things, regulation, of, muscle, blood, flow, and, mitochondrial, respiration, nitrite, no, 2, consumption, is, primarily, determined, by, the, amount, of, processed, meats, eaten, and, the, concentration, of, nitrates, no, 3, added, to, these, meats, bacon, sausages, for, their, curing, although, nitrites, are, the, nitrogen, species, chiefly, used, in, meat, curing, nitrates, are, used, as, well, and, can, be, transformed, into, nitrite, by, microorganisms, or, in, the, digestion, process, starting, by, their, dissolution, in, saliva, and, their, contact, with, the, microbiota, of, the, mouth, nitrites, lead, to, the, formation, of, carcinogenic, nitrosamines, the, production, of, nitrosamines, may, be, inhibited, by, the, use, of, the, antioxidants, vitamin, c, and, the, alpha, tocopherol, form, of, vitamin, e, during, curing, many, meat, processors, claim, their, meats, e, g, bacon, is, uncured, which, is, a, marketing, claim, with, no, factual, basis, there, is, no, such, thing, as, uncured, bacon, as, that, would, be, essentially, raw, sliced, pork, belly, uncured, meat, is, in, fact, actually, cured, with, nitrites, with, virtually, no, distinction, in, process, the, only, difference, being, the, usda, labeling, requirement, between, nitrite, of, vegetable, origin, such, as, from, celery, vs, synthetic, sodium, nitrite, an, analogy, would, be, purified, sea, salt, vs, sodium, chloride, both, being, exactly, the, same, chemical, with, the, only, essential, difference, being, the, origin, anti, hypertensive, diets, such, as, the, dash, diet, typically, contain, high, levels, of, nitrates, which, are, first, reduced, to, nitrite, in, the, saliva, as, detected, in, saliva, testing, prior, to, forming, nitric, oxide, no, symptoms, of, nitrate, poisoning, in, domestic, animals, include, increased, heart, rate, and, respiration, in, advanced, cases, blood, and, tissue, may, turn, a, blue, or, brown, color, feed, can, be, tested, for, nitrate, treatment, consists, of, supplementing, or, substituting, existing, supplies, with, lower, nitrate, material, safe, levels, of, nitrate, for, various, types, of, livestock, are, as, follows, the, values, above, are, on, a, dry, moisture, free, basis, nitrate, formation, with, elements, of, the, periodic, table
