platinum, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, pt, and, atomic, number, 78, it, is, a, dense, malleable, ductile, highly, unreactive, precious, silverish, white, transition, metal, its, name, originates, from, spanish, platina, a, diminutive, of, plata, little, silver, platinum, is, a, member, of, the, platinum, group, of, elements, and, group, 10, of, the, periodic, table, of, elements, it, has, six, naturally, occurring, isotopes, it, is, one, of, the, rarer, elements, in, earth, s, crust, with, an, average, abundance, of, approximately, 5, g, kg, it, occurs, in, some, nickel, and, copper, ores, along, with, some, native, deposits, mostly, in, south, africa, which, accounts, for, 80, of, the, world, production, because, of, its, scarcity, in, earth, s, crust, only, a, few, hundred, tonnes, are, produced, annually, and, given, its, important, uses, it, is, highly, valuable, and, is, a, major, precious, metal, commodity, platinum, is, one, of, the, least, reactive, metals, it, has, remarkable, resistance, to, corrosion, even, at, high, temperatures, and, is, therefore, considered, a, noble, metal, consequently, platinum, is, often, found, chemically, uncombined, as, native, platinum, because, it, occurs, naturally, in, the, alluvial, sands, of, various, rivers, it, was, first, used, by, pre, columbian, south, american, natives, to, produce, artifacts, it, was, referenced, in, european, writings, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, but, it, was, not, until, antonio, de, ulloa, published, a, report, on, a, new, metal, of, colombian, origin, in, 1748, that, it, began, to, be, investigated, by, scientists, platinum, is, used, in, catalytic, converters, laboratory, equipment, electrical, contacts, and, electrodes, platinum, resistance, thermometers, dentistry, equipment, and, jewelry, platinum, is, used, in, the, glass, industry, to, manipulate, molten, glass, which, does, not, wet, platinum, as, a, heavy, metal, it, leads, to, health, problems, upon, exposure, to, its, salts, but, due, to, its, corrosion, resistance, metallic, platinum, has, not, been, linked, to, adverse, health, effects, compounds, containing, platinum, such, as, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and, carboplatin, are, applied, in, chemotherapy, against, certain, types, of, cancer, pure, platinum, is, a, lustrous, ductile, and, malleable, silver, white, metal, platinum, is, more, ductile, than, gold, silver, or, copper, thus, being, the, most, ductile, of, pure, metals, but, it, is, less, malleable, than, gold, its, physical, characteristics, and, chemical, stability, make, it, useful, for, industrial, applications, its, resistance, to, wear, and, tarnish, is, well, suited, to, use, in, fine, jewellery, platinum, has, excellent, resistance, to, corrosion, bulk, platinum, does, not, oxidize, in, air, at, any, temperature, but, it, forms, a, thin, surface, film, of, pto, 2, that, can, be, easily, removed, by, heating, to, about, 400, c, the, most, common, oxidation, states, of, platinum, are, 2, and, 4, the, 1, and, 3, oxidation, states, are, less, common, and, are, often, stabilized, by, metal, bonding, in, bimetallic, or, polymetallic, species, tetracoordinate, platinum, ii, compounds, tend, to, adopt, 16, electron, square, planar, geometries, although, elemental, platinum, is, generally, unreactive, it, is, attacked, by, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and, sulfur, it, reacts, vigorously, with, fluorine, at, 500, c, 932, f, to, form, platinum, tetrafluoride, platinum, is, insoluble, in, hydrochloric, and, nitric, acid, but, dissolves, in, hot, aqua, regia, a, mixture, of, nitric, and, hydrochloric, acids, to, form, aqueous, chloroplatinic, acid, h, 2, ptcl, 6, as, a, soft, acid, the, pt, 2, ion, has, a, great, affinity, for, sulfide, and, sulfur, ligands, numerous, dmso, complexes, have, been, reported, and, care, is, taken, in, the, choosing, of, reaction, solvents, in, 2007, the, german, scientist, gerhard, ertl, won, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, determining, the, detailed, molecular, mechanisms, of, the, catalytic, oxidation, of, carbon, monoxide, over, platinum, catalytic, converter, platinum, has, six, naturally, occurring, isotopes, 190, pt, 192, pt, 194, pt, 195, pt, 196, pt, and, 198, pt, the, most, abundant, of, these, is, 195, pt, comprising, 33, 83, of, all, platinum, it, is, the, only, stable, isotope, with, a, non, zero, spin, the, spin, of, 1, 2, and, other, favourable, magnetic, properties, of, the, nucleus, are, utilised, in, 195, pt, nmr, due, to, its, spin, and, large, abundance, 195, pt, satellite, peaks, are, also, often, observed, in, 1, h, and, 31, p, nmr, spectroscopy, e, g, for, pt, phosphine, and, pt, alkyl, complexes, 190, pt, is, the, least, abundant, at, only, 0, 01, of, the, naturally, occurring, isotopes, only, 190, pt, is, unstable, though, it, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 6, 5, 10, 11, years, causing, an, activity, of, 15, bq, kg, of, natural, platinum, other, isotopes, can, undergo, alpha, decay, but, their, decay, has, never, been, observed, therefore, they, are, considered, stable, platinum, also, has, 38, synthetic, isotopes, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 165, to, 208, making, the, total, number, of, known, isotopes, 44, the, least, stable, of, these, are, 165, pt, and, 166, pt, with, half, lives, of, 260, s, whereas, the, most, stable, is, 193, pt, with, a, half, life, of, 50, years, most, platinum, isotopes, decay, by, some, combination, of, beta, decay, and, alpha, decay, 188, pt, 191, pt, and, 193, pt, decay, primarily, by, electron, capture, 190, pt, and, 198, pt, are, predicted, to, have, energetically, favorable, double, beta, decay, paths, platinum, is, an, extremely, rare, metal, occurring, at, a, concentration, of, only, 0, 005, ppm, in, earth, s, crust, sometimes, mistaken, for, silver, platinum, is, often, found, chemically, uncombined, as, native, platinum, and, as, alloy, with, the, other, platinum, group, metals, and, iron, mostly, most, often, the, native, platinum, is, found, in, secondary, deposits, in, alluvial, deposits, the, alluvial, deposits, used, by, pre, columbian, people, in, the, choc, department, colombia, are, still, a, source, for, platinum, group, metals, another, large, alluvial, deposit, is, in, the, ural, mountains, russia, and, it, is, still, mined, in, nickel, and, copper, deposits, platinum, group, metals, occur, as, sulfides, e, g, pt, pd, s, tellurides, e, g, ptbite, antimonides, pdsb, and, arsenides, e, g, ptas, 2, and, as, end, alloys, with, nickel, or, copper, platinum, arsenide, sperrylite, ptas, 2, is, a, major, source, of, platinum, associated, with, nickel, ores, in, the, sudbury, basin, deposit, in, ontario, canada, at, platinum, alaska, about, 17, 000, kg, 550, 000, ozt, was, mined, between, 1927, and, 1975, the, mine, ceased, operations, in, 1990, the, rare, sulfide, mineral, cooperite, pt, pd, ni, s, contains, platinum, along, with, palladium, and, nickel, cooperite, occurs, in, the, merensky, reef, within, the, bushveld, complex, gauteng, south, africa, in, 1865, chromites, were, identified, in, the, bushveld, region, of, south, africa, followed, by, the, discovery, of, platinum, in, 1906, in, 1924, the, geologist, hans, merensky, discovered, a, large, supply, of, platinum, in, the, bushveld, igneous, complex, in, south, africa, the, specific, layer, he, found, named, the, merensky, reef, contains, around, 75, of, the, world, s, known, platinum, the, large, copper, nickel, deposits, near, norilsk, in, russia, and, the, sudbury, basin, canada, are, the, two, other, large, deposits, in, the, sudbury, basin, the, huge, quantities, of, nickel, ore, processed, make, up, for, the, fact, platinum, is, present, as, only, 0, 5, ppm, in, the, ore, smaller, reserves, can, be, found, in, the, united, states, for, example, in, the, absaroka, range, in, montana, in, 2010, south, africa, was, the, top, producer, of, platinum, with, an, almost, 77, share, followed, by, russia, at, 13, world, production, in, 2010, was, 192, 000, kg, 423, 000, lb, large, platinum, deposits, are, present, in, the, state, of, tamil, nadu, india, platinum, exists, in, higher, abundances, on, the, moon, and, in, meteorites, correspondingly, platinum, is, found, in, slightly, higher, abundances, at, sites, of, bolide, impact, on, earth, that, are, associated, with, resulting, post, impact, volcanism, and, can, be, mined, economically, the, sudbury, basin, is, one, such, example, hexachloroplatinic, acid, mentioned, above, is, probably, the, most, important, platinum, compound, as, it, serves, as, the, precursor, for, many, other, platinum, compounds, by, itself, it, has, various, applications, in, photography, zinc, etchings, indelible, ink, plating, mirrors, porcelain, coloring, and, as, a, catalyst, treatment, of, hexachloroplatinic, acid, with, an, ammonium, salt, such, as, ammonium, chloride, gives, ammonium, hexachloroplatinate, which, is, relatively, insoluble, in, ammonium, solutions, heating, this, ammonium, salt, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, reduces, it, to, elemental, platinum, potassium, hexachloroplatinate, is, similarly, insoluble, and, hexachloroplatinic, acid, has, been, used, in, the, determination, of, potassium, ions, by, gravimetry, when, hexachloroplatinic, acid, is, heated, it, decomposes, through, platinum, iv, chloride, and, platinum, ii, chloride, to, elemental, platinum, although, the, reactions, do, not, occur, stepwise, all, three, reactions, are, reversible, platinum, ii, and, platinum, iv, bromides, are, known, as, well, platinum, hexafluoride, is, a, strong, oxidizer, capable, of, oxidizing, oxygen, platinum, iv, oxide, pto, 2, also, known, as, adams, catalyst, is, a, black, powder, that, is, soluble, in, potassium, hydroxide, koh, solutions, and, concentrated, acids, pto, 2, and, the, less, common, pto, both, decompose, upon, heating, platinum, ii, iv, oxide, pt, 3, o, 4, is, formed, in, the, following, reaction, unlike, palladium, acetate, platinum, ii, acetate, is, not, commercially, available, where, a, base, is, desired, the, halides, have, been, used, in, conjunction, with, sodium, acetate, the, use, of, platinum, ii, acetylacetonate, has, also, been, reported, several, barium, platinides, have, been, synthesized, in, which, platinum, exhibits, negative, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 1, to, 2, these, include, bapt, ba, 3, pt, 2, and, ba, 2, pt, caesium, platinide, cs, 2, pt, a, dark, red, transparent, crystalline, compound, has, been, shown, to, contain, pt, 2, anions, platinum, also, exhibits, negative, oxidation, states, at, surfaces, reduced, electrochemically, the, negative, oxidation, states, exhibited, by, platinum, are, unusual, for, metallic, elements, and, they, are, attributed, to, the, relativistic, stabilization, of, the, 6s, orbitals, it, is, predicted, that, even, the, cation, pto, 2, 4, in, which, platinum, exists, in, the, 10, oxidation, state, may, be, achievable, zeise, s, salt, containing, an, ethylene, ligand, was, one, of, the, first, organometallic, compounds, discovered, dichloro, cycloocta, 1, 5, diene, platinum, ii, is, a, commercially, available, olefin, complex, which, contains, easily, displaceable, cod, ligands, cod, being, an, abbreviation, of, 1, 5, cyclooctadiene, the, cod, complex, and, the, halides, are, convenient, starting, points, to, platinum, chemistry, cisplatin, or, cis, diamminedichloroplatinum, ii, is, the, first, of, a, series, of, square, planar, platinum, ii, containing, chemotherapy, drugs, others, include, carboplatin, and, oxaliplatin, these, compounds, are, capable, of, crosslinking, dna, and, kill, cells, by, similar, pathways, to, alkylating, chemotherapeutic, agents, side, effects, of, cisplatin, include, nausea, and, vomiting, hair, loss, tinnitus, hearing, loss, and, nephrotoxicity, organoplatinum, compounds, such, as, the, above, antitumour, agents, as, well, as, soluble, inorganic, platinum, complexes, are, routinely, characterised, using, 195, pt, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, archaeologists, have, discovered, traces, of, platinum, in, the, gold, used, in, ancient, egyptian, burials, as, early, as, 1200, bce, for, example, a, small, box, from, burial, of, shepenupet, ii, was, found, to, be, decorated, with, gold, platinum, hieroglyphics, however, the, extent, of, early, egyptians, knowledge, of, the, metal, is, unclear, it, is, quite, possible, they, did, not, recognize, there, was, platinum, in, their, gold, the, metal, was, used, by, native, americans, near, modern, day, esmeraldas, ecuador, to, produce, artifacts, of, a, white, gold, platinum, alloy, archeologists, usually, associate, the, tradition, of, platinum, working, in, south, america, with, the, la, tolita, culture, c, 600, bce, 200, ce, but, precise, dates, and, location, are, difficult, as, most, platinum, artifacts, from, the, area, were, bought, secondhand, through, the, antiquities, trade, rather, than, obtained, by, direct, archeological, excavation, to, work, the, metal, they, would, combine, gold, and, platinum, powders, by, sintering, the, resulting, gold, platinum, alloy, would, then, be, soft, enough, to, shape, with, tools, the, platinum, used, in, such, objects, was, not, the, pure, element, but, rather, a, naturally, occurring, mixture, of, the, platinum, group, metals, with, small, amounts, of, palladium, rhodium, and, iridium, the, first, european, reference, to, platinum, appears, in, 1557, in, the, writings, of, the, italian, humanist, julius, caesar, scaliger, as, a, description, of, an, unknown, noble, metal, found, between, dari, n, and, mexico, which, no, fire, nor, any, spanish, artifice, has, yet, been, able, to, liquefy, from, their, first, encounters, with, platinum, the, spanish, generally, saw, the, metal, as, a, kind, of, impurity, in, gold, and, it, was, treated, as, such, it, was, often, simply, thrown, away, and, there, was, an, official, decree, forbidding, the, adulteration, of, gold, with, platinum, impurities, in, 1735, antonio, de, ulloa, and, jorge, juan, y, santacilia, saw, native, americans, mining, platinum, while, the, spaniards, were, travelling, through, colombia, and, peru, for, eight, years, ulloa, and, juan, found, mines, with, the, whitish, metal, nuggets, and, took, them, home, to, spain, antonio, de, ulloa, returned, to, spain, and, established, the, first, mineralogy, lab, in, spain, and, was, the, first, to, systematically, study, platinum, which, was, in, 1748, his, historical, account, of, the, expedition, included, a, description, of, platinum, as, being, neither, separable, nor, calcinable, ulloa, also, anticipated, the, discovery, of, platinum, mines, after, publishing, the, report, in, 1748, ulloa, did, not, continue, to, investigate, the, new, metal, in, 1758, he, was, sent, to, superintend, mercury, mining, operations, in, huancavelica, in, 1741, charles, wood, a, british, metallurgist, found, various, samples, of, colombian, platinum, in, jamaica, which, he, sent, to, william, brownrigg, for, further, investigation, in, 1750, after, studying, the, platinum, sent, to, him, by, wood, brownrigg, presented, a, detailed, account, of, the, metal, to, the, royal, society, stating, that, he, had, seen, no, mention, of, it, in, any, previous, accounts, of, known, minerals, brownrigg, also, made, note, of, platinum, s, extremely, high, melting, point, and, refractoriness, toward, borax, other, chemists, across, europe, soon, began, studying, platinum, including, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, torbern, bergman, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, william, lewis, and, pierre, macquer, in, 1752, henrik, scheffer, published, a, detailed, scientific, description, of, the, metal, which, he, referred, to, as, white, gold, including, an, account, of, how, he, succeeded, in, fusing, platinum, ore, with, the, aid, of, arsenic, scheffer, described, platinum, as, being, less, pliable, than, gold, but, with, similar, resistance, to, corrosion, karl, von, sickingen, researched, platinum, extensively, in, 1772, he, succeeded, in, making, malleable, platinum, by, alloying, it, with, gold, dissolving, the, alloy, in, hot, aqua, regia, precipitating, the, platinum, with, ammonium, chloride, igniting, the, ammonium, chloroplatinate, and, hammering, the, resulting, finely, divided, platinum, to, make, it, cohere, franz, karl, achard, made, the, first, platinum, crucible, in, 1784, he, worked, with, the, platinum, by, fusing, it, with, arsenic, then, later, volatilizing, the, arsenic, because, the, other, platinum, family, members, were, not, discovered, yet, platinum, was, the, first, in, the, list, scheffer, and, sickingen, made, the, false, assumption, that, due, to, its, hardness, which, is, slightly, more, than, for, pure, iron, platinum, would, be, a, relatively, non, pliable, material, even, brittle, at, times, when, in, fact, its, ductility, and, malleability, are, close, to, that, of, gold, their, assumptions, could, not, be, avoided, because, the, platinum, they, experimented, with, was, highly, contaminated, with, minute, amounts, of, platinum, family, elements, such, as, osmium, and, iridium, amongst, others, which, embrittled, the, platinum, alloy, alloying, this, impure, platinum, residue, called, plyoxen, with, gold, was, the, only, solution, at, the, time, to, obtain, a, pliable, compound, but, nowadays, very, pure, platinum, is, available, and, extremely, long, wires, can, be, drawn, from, pure, platinum, very, easily, due, to, its, crystalline, structure, which, is, similar, to, that, of, many, soft, metals, in, 1786, charles, iii, of, spain, provided, a, library, and, laboratory, to, pierre, fran, ois, chabaneau, to, aid, in, his, research, of, platinum, chabaneau, succeeded, in, removing, various, impurities, from, the, ore, including, gold, mercury, lead, copper, and, iron, this, led, him, to, believe, he, was, working, with, a, single, metal, but, in, truth, the, ore, still, contained, the, yet, undiscovered, platinum, group, metals, this, led, to, inconsistent, results, in, his, experiments, at, times, the, platinum, seemed, malleable, but, when, it, was, alloyed, with, iridium, it, would, be, much, more, brittle, sometimes, the, metal, was, entirely, incombustible, but, when, alloyed, with, osmium, it, would, volatilize, after, several, months, chabaneau, succeeded, in, producing, 23, kilograms, of, pure, malleable, platinum, by, hammering, and, compressing, the, sponge, form, while, white, hot, chabeneau, realized, the, infusibility, of, platinum, would, lend, value, to, objects, made, of, it, and, so, started, a, business, with, joaqu, n, cabezas, producing, platinum, ingots, and, utensils, this, started, what, is, known, as, the, platinum, age, in, spain, platinum, along, with, the, rest, of, the, platinum, group, metals, is, obtained, commercially, as, a, by, product, from, nickel, and, copper, mining, and, processing, during, electrorefining, of, copper, noble, metals, such, as, silver, gold, and, the, platinum, group, metals, as, well, as, selenium, and, tellurium, settle, to, the, bottom, of, the, cell, as, anode, mud, which, forms, the, starting, point, for, the, extraction, of, the, platinum, group, metals, if, pure, platinum, is, found, in, placer, deposits, or, other, ores, it, is, isolated, from, them, by, various, methods, of, subtracting, impurities, because, platinum, is, significantly, denser, than, many, of, its, impurities, the, lighter, impurities, can, be, removed, by, simply, floating, them, away, in, a, liquid, platinum, is, paramagnetic, whereas, nickel, and, iron, are, both, ferromagnetic, these, two, impurities, are, thus, removed, by, running, an, electromagnet, over, the, mixture, because, platinum, has, a, higher, melting, point, than, most, other, substances, many, impurities, can, be, burned, or, melted, away, without, melting, the, platinum, finally, platinum, is, resistant, to, hydrochloric, and, sulfuric, acids, whereas, other, substances, are, readily, attacked, by, them, metal, impurities, can, be, removed, by, stirring, the, mixture, in, either, of, the, two, acids, and, recovering, the, remaining, platinum, one, suitable, method, for, purification, for, the, raw, platinum, which, contains, platinum, gold, and, the, other, platinum, group, metals, is, to, process, it, with, aqua, regia, in, which, palladium, gold, and, platinum, are, dissolved, whereas, osmium, iridium, ruthenium, and, rhodium, stay, unreacted, the, gold, is, precipitated, by, the, addition, of, iron, ii, chloride, and, after, filtering, off, the, gold, the, platinum, is, precipitated, as, ammonium, chloroplatinate, by, the, addition, of, ammonium, chloride, ammonium, chloroplatinate, can, be, converted, to, platinum, by, heating, unprecipitated, hexachloroplatinate, iv, may, be, reduced, with, elemental, zinc, and, a, similar, method, is, suitable, for, small, scale, recovery, of, platinum, from, laboratory, residues, mining, and, refining, platinum, has, environmental, impacts, of, the, 218, tonnes, of, platinum, sold, in, 2014, 98, tonnes, were, used, for, vehicle, emissions, control, devices, 45, 74, 7, tonnes, for, jewelry, 34, 20, 0, tonnes, for, chemical, production, and, petroleum, refining, 9, 2, and, 5, 85, tonnes, for, electrical, applications, such, as, hard, disk, drives, 2, 7, the, remaining, 28, 9, tonnes, went, to, various, other, minor, applications, such, as, medicine, and, biomedicine, glassmaking, equipment, investment, electrodes, anticancer, drugs, oxygen, sensors, spark, plugs, and, turbine, engines, the, most, common, use, of, platinum, is, as, a, catalyst, in, chemical, reactions, often, as, platinum, black, it, has, been, employed, as, a, catalyst, since, the, early, 19th, century, when, platinum, powder, was, used, to, catalyze, the, ignition, of, hydrogen, its, most, important, application, is, in, automobiles, as, a, catalytic, converter, which, allows, the, complete, combustion, of, low, concentrations, of, unburned, hydrocarbons, from, the, exhaust, into, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, platinum, is, also, used, in, the, petroleum, industry, as, a, catalyst, in, a, number, of, separate, processes, but, especially, in, catalytic, reforming, of, straight, run, naphthas, into, higher, octane, gasoline, that, becomes, rich, in, aromatic, compounds, pto, 2, also, known, as, adams, catalyst, is, used, as, a, hydrogenation, catalyst, specifically, for, vegetable, oils, platinum, also, strongly, catalyzes, the, decomposition, of, hydrogen, peroxide, into, water, and, oxygen, and, it, is, used, in, fuel, cells, as, a, catalyst, for, the, reduction, of, oxygen, as, a, fuel, cell, catalyst, platinum, enables, hydrogen, and, oxygen, reactions, to, take, place, at, an, optimum, rate, it, is, used, in, platinum, based, proton, exchange, membrane, pem, technologies, required, in, green, hydrogen, production, as, well, as, fuel, cell, electric, vehicle, adoption, fcev, from, 1889, to, 1960, the, meter, was, defined, as, the, length, of, a, platinum, iridium, 90, 10, alloy, bar, known, as, the, international, prototype, meter, the, previous, bar, was, made, of, platinum, in, 1799, until, may, 2019, the, kilogram, was, defined, as, the, mass, of, the, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, a, cylinder, of, the, same, platinum, iridium, alloy, made, in, 1879, the, standard, platinum, resistance, thermometer, sprt, is, one, of, the, four, types, of, thermometers, used, to, define, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, its, 90, the, international, calibration, standard, for, temperature, measurements, the, resistance, wire, in, the, thermometer, is, made, of, pure, platinum, nist, manufactured, the, wires, from, platinum, bar, stock, with, a, chemical, purity, of, 99, 999, by, weight, in, addition, to, laboratory, uses, platinum, resistance, thermometry, prt, also, has, many, industrial, applications, industrial, standards, include, astm, e1137, and, iec, 60751, the, standard, hydrogen, electrode, also, uses, a, platinized, platinum, electrode, due, to, its, corrosion, resistance, and, other, attributes, platinum, is, a, precious, metal, commodity, its, bullion, has, the, iso, currency, code, of, xpt, coins, bars, and, ingots, are, traded, or, collected, platinum, finds, use, in, jewellery, usually, as, a, 90, 95, alloy, due, to, its, inertness, it, is, used, for, this, purpose, for, its, prestige, and, inherent, bullion, value, jewellery, trade, publications, advise, jewellers, to, present, minute, surface, scratches, which, they, term, patina, as, a, desirable, feature, in, an, attempt, to, enhance, value, of, platinum, products, in, watchmaking, vacheron, constantin, patek, philippe, rolex, breitling, and, other, companies, use, platinum, for, producing, their, limited, edition, watch, series, watchmakers, appreciate, the, unique, properties, of, platinum, as, it, neither, tarnishes, nor, wears, out, the, latter, quality, relative, to, gold, during, periods, of, sustained, economic, stability, and, growth, the, price,

thermogravimetric, analysis, because, of, the, stringent, requirements, of, chemical, inertness, upon, heating, to, high, temperatures, 1000, c, platinum, is, used, as, an, alloying, agent, for, various, metal, products, including, fine, wires, noncorrosive, laboratory, containers, medical, instruments, dental, prostheses, electrical, contacts, and, thermocouples, platinum, cobalt, an, alloy, of, roughly, three, parts, platinum, and, one, part, cobalt, is, used, to, make, relatively, strong, permanent, magnets, platinum, based, anodes, are, used, in, ships, pipelines, and, steel, piers, platinum, drugs, are, used, to, treat, a, wide, variety, of, cancers, including, testicular, and, ovarian, carcinomas, melanoma, small, cell, and, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, myelomas, and,

the, eyes, nose, and, throat, and, long, term, exposure, may, cause, both, respiratory, and, skin, allergies, the, current, osha, standard, is, 2, micrograms, per, cubic, meter, of, air, averaged, over, an, 8, hour, work, shift, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, for, platinum, as, 1, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, as, platinum, is, a, catalyst, in, the, manufacture, of, the, silicone, rubber, and, gel, components, of, several, types, of, medical, implants, breast, implants, joint, replacement, prosthetics, artificial, lumbar, discs, vascular, access, ports, etc, the, possibility, that, platinum, could, enter, the, body, and, cause, adverse, effects, has, merited, study, the, food, and, drug, administration, and, other, institutions, have, reviewed, the, issue, and, found, no, evidence, to, suggest, toxicity, in, vivo, chemically, unbounded, platinum, has, been, identified, by, the,
