in, chemistry, amines, m, i, n, m, i, n, uk, also, e, m, i, n, are, compounds, and, functional, groups, that, contain, a, basic, nitrogen, atom, with, a, lone, pair, formally, amines, are, derivatives, of, ammonia, nh, 3, wherein, one, or, more, hydrogen, atoms, have, been, replaced, by, a, substituent, such, as, an, alkyl, or, aryl, group, these, may, respectively, be, called, alkylamines, and, arylamines, amines, in, which, both, types, of, substituent, are, attached, to, one, nitrogen, atom, may, be, called, alkylarylamines, important, amines, include, amino, acids, biogenic, amines, trimethylamine, and, aniline, inorganic, derivatives, of, ammonia, are, also, called, amines, such, as, monochloramine, nclh, 2, the, substituent, nh, 2, is, called, an, amino, group, compounds, with, a, nitrogen, atom, attached, to, a, carbonyl, group, thus, having, the, structure, r, c, o, nr, r, are, called, amides, and, have, different, chemical, properties, from, amines, amines, can, be, classified, according, to, the, nature, and, number, of, substituents, on, nitrogen, aliphatic, amines, contain, only, h, and, alkyl, substituents, aromatic, amines, have, the, nitrogen, atom, connected, to, an, aromatic, ring, amines, alkyl, and, aryl, alike, are, organized, into, three, subcategories, see, table, based, on, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, adjacent, to, the, nitrogen, how, many, hydrogen, atoms, of, the, ammonia, molecule, are, replaced, by, hydrocarbon, groups, a, fourth, subcategory, is, determined, by, the, connectivity, of, the, substituents, attached, to, the, nitrogen, it, is, also, possible, to, have, four, organic, substituents, on, the, nitrogen, these, species, are, not, amines, but, are, quaternary, ammonium, cations, and, have, a, charged, nitrogen, center, quaternary, ammonium, salts, exist, with, many, kinds, of, anions, amines, are, named, in, several, ways, typically, the, compound, is, given, the, prefix, amino, or, the, suffix, amine, the, prefix, n, shows, substitution, on, the, nitrogen, atom, an, organic, compound, with, multiple, amino, groups, is, called, a, diamine, triamine, tetraamine, and, so, forth, lower, amines, are, named, with, the, suffix, amine, higher, amines, have, the, prefix, amino, as, a, functional, group, iupac, however, does, not, recommend, this, convention, but, prefers, the, alkanamine, form, e, g, butan, 2, amine, hydrogen, bonding, significantly, influences, the, properties, of, primary, and, secondary, amines, for, example, methyl, and, ethyl, amines, are, gases, under, standard, conditions, whereas, the, corresponding, methyl, and, ethyl, alcohols, are, liquids, amines, possess, a, characteristic, ammonia, smell, liquid, amines, have, a, distinctive, fishy, and, foul, smell, the, nitrogen, atom, features, a, lone, electron, pair, that, can, bind, h, to, form, an, ammonium, ion, r, 3, nh, the, lone, electron, pair, is, represented, in, this, article, by, two, dots, above, or, next, to, the, n, the, water, solubility, of, simple, amines, is, enhanced, by, hydrogen, bonding, involving, these, lone, electron, pairs, typically, salts, of, ammonium, compounds, exhibit, the, following, order, of, solubility, in, water, primary, ammonium, rnh, 3, secondary, ammonium, r, 2, nh, 2, tertiary, ammonium, r, 3, nh, small, aliphatic, amines, display, significant, solubility, in, many, solvents, whereas, those, with, large, substituents, are, lipophilic, aromatic, amines, such, as, aniline, have, their, lone, pair, electrons, conjugated, into, the, benzene, ring, thus, their, tendency, to, engage, in, hydrogen, bonding, is, diminished, their, boiling, points, are, high, and, their, solubility, in, water, is, low, typically, the, presence, of, an, amine, functional, group, is, deduced, by, a, combination, of, techniques, including, mass, spectrometry, as, well, as, nmr, and, ir, spectroscopies, 1, h, nmr, signals, for, amines, disappear, upon, treatment, of, the, sample, with, d, 2, o, in, their, infrared, spectrum, primary, amines, exhibit, two, n, h, bands, whereas, secondary, amines, exhibit, only, one, in, their, ir, spectra, primary, and, secondary, amines, exhibit, distinctive, n, h, stretching, bands, near, 3300, cm, 1, somewhat, less, distinctive, are, the, bands, appearing, below, 1600, cm, 1, which, are, weaker, and, overlap, with, c, c, and, c, h, modes, for, the, case, of, propyl, amine, the, h, n, h, scissor, mode, appears, near, 1600, cm, 1, the, c, n, stretch, near, 1000, cm, 1, and, the, r, 2, n, h, bend, near, 810, cm, 1, alkyl, amines, characteristically, feature, tetrahedral, nitrogen, centers, c, n, c, and, c, n, h, angles, approach, the, idealized, angle, of, 109, c, n, distances, are, slightly, shorter, than, c, c, distances, the, energy, barrier, for, the, nitrogen, inversion, of, the, stereocenter, is, about, 7, kcal, mol, for, a, trialkylamine, the, interconversion, has, been, compared, to, the, inversion, of, an, open, umbrella, into, a, strong, wind, amines, of, the, type, nhrr, and, nrr, r, are, chiral, the, nitrogen, center, bears, four, substituents, counting, the, lone, pair, because, of, the, low, barrier, to, inversion, amines, of, the, type, nhrr, cannot, be, obtained, in, optical, purity, for, chiral, tertiary, amines, nrr, r, can, only, be, resolved, when, the, r, r, and, r, groups, are, constrained, in, cyclic, structures, such, as, n, substituted, aziridines, quaternary, ammonium, salts, are, resolvable, in, aromatic, amines, anilines, nitrogen, is, often, nearly, planar, owing, to, conjugation, of, the, lone, pair, with, the, aryl, substituent, the, c, n, distance, is, correspondingly, shorter, in, aniline, the, c, n, distance, is, the, same, as, the, c, c, distances, like, ammonia, amines, are, bases, compared, to, alkali, metal, hydroxides, amines, are, weaker, the, basicity, of, amines, depends, on, owing, to, inductive, effects, the, basicity, of, an, amine, might, be, expected, to, increase, with, the, number, of, alkyl, groups, on, the, amine, correlations, are, complicated, owing, to, the, effects, of, solvation, which, are, opposite, the, trends, for, inductive, effects, solvation, effects, also, dominate, the, basicity, of, aromatic, amines, anilines, for, anilines, the, lone, pair, of, electrons, on, nitrogen, delocalizes, into, the, ring, resulting, in, decreased, basicity, substituents, on, the, aromatic, ring, and, their, positions, relative, to, the, amino, group, also, affect, basicity, as, seen, in, the, table, solvation, significantly, affects, the, basicity, of, amines, n, h, groups, strongly, interact, with, water, especially, in, ammonium, ions, consequently, the, basicity, of, ammonia, is, enhanced, by, 10, 11, by, solvation, the, intrinsic, basicity, of, amines, i, e, the, situation, where, solvation, is, unimportant, has, been, evaluated, in, the, gas, phase, in, the, gas, phase, amines, exhibit, the, basicities, predicted, from, the, electron, releasing, effects, of, the, organic, substituents, thus, tertiary, amines, are, more, basic, than, secondary, amines, which, are, more, basic, than, primary, amines, and, finally, ammonia, is, least, basic, the, order, of, pk, b, s, basicities, in, water, does, not, follow, this, order, similarly, aniline, is, more, basic, than, ammonia, in, the, gas, phase, but, ten, thousand, times, less, so, in, aqueous, solution, in, aprotic, polar, solvents, such, as, dmso, dmf, and, acetonitrile, the, energy, of, solvation, is, not, as, high, as, in, protic, polar, solvents, like, water, and, methanol, for, this, reason, the, basicity, of, amines, in, these, aprotic, solvents, is, almost, solely, governed, by, the, electronic, effects, industrially, significant, alkyl, amines, are, prepared, from, ammonia, by, alkylation, with, alcohols, unlike, the, reaction, of, amines, with, alcohols, the, reaction, of, amines, and, ammonia, with, alkyl, halides, is, used, for, synthesis, in, the, laboratory, in, such, reactions, which, are, more, useful, for, alkyl, iodides, and, bromides, the, degree, of, alkylation, is, difficult, to, control, such, that, one, obtains, mixtures, of, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, amines, as, well, as, quaternary, ammonium, salts, selectivity, can, be, improved, via, the, del, pine, reaction, although, this, is, rarely, employed, on, an, industrial, scale, selectivity, is, also, assured, in, the, gabriel, synthesis, which, involves, organohalide, reacting, with, potassium, phthalimide, aryl, halides, are, much, less, reactive, toward, amines, and, for, that, reason, are, more, controllable, a, popular, way, to, prepare, aryl, amines, is, the, buchwald, hartwig, reaction, disubstituted, alkenes, react, with, hcn, in, the, presence, of, strong, acids, to, give, formamides, which, can, be, decarbonylated, this, method, the, ritter, reaction, is, used, industrially, to, produce, tertiary, amines, such, as, tert, octylamine, hydroamination, of, alkenes, is, also, widely, practiced, the, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, zeolite, based, solid, acids, via, the, process, of, hydrogenation, unsaturated, n, containing, functional, groups, are, reduced, to, amines, using, hydrogen, in, the, presence, of, a, nickel, catalyst, suitable, groups, include, nitriles, azides, imines, including, oximes, amides, and, nitro, in, the, case, of, nitriles, reactions, are, sensitive, to, acidic, or, alkaline, conditions, which, can, cause, hydrolysis, of, the, cn, group, lialh, 4, is, more, commonly, employed, for, the, reduction, of, these, same, groups, on, the, laboratory, scale, many, amines, are, produced, from, aldehydes, and, ketones, via, reductive, amination, which, can, either, proceed, catalytically, or, stoichiometrically, aniline, c, 6, h, 5, nh, 2, and, its, derivatives, are, prepared, by, reduction, of, the, nitroaromatics, in, industry, hydrogen, is, the, preferred, reductant, whereas, in, the, laboratory, tin, and, iron, are, often, employed, many, methods, exist, for, the, preparation, of, amines, many, of, these, methods, being, rather, specialized, aside, from, their, basicity, the, dominant, reactivity, of, amines, is, their, nucleophilicity, most, primary, amines, are, good, ligands, for, metal, ions, to, give, coordination, complexes, amines, are, alkylated, by, alkyl, halides, acyl, chlorides, and, acid, anhydrides, react, with, primary, and, secondary, amines, to, form, amides, the, schotten, baumann, reaction, similarly, with, sulfonyl, chlorides, one, obtains, sulfonamides, this, transformation, known, as, the, hinsberg, reaction, is, a, chemical, test, for, the, presence, of, amines, because, amines, are, basic, they, neutralize, acids, to, form, the, corresponding, ammonium, salts, r, 3, nh, when, formed, from, carboxylic, acids, and, primary, and, secondary, amines, these, salts, thermally, dehydrate, to, form, the, corresponding, amides, amines, undergo, sulfamation, upon, treatment, with, sulfur, trioxide, or, sources, thereof, amines, reacts, with, nitrous, acid, to, give, diazonium, salts, the, alkyl, diazonium, salts, are, of, little, importance, because, they, are, too, unstable, the, most, important, members, are, derivatives, of, aromatic, amines, such, as, aniline, phenylamine, a, aryl, or, naphthyl, anilines, and, naphthylamines, form, more, stable, diazonium, salts, which, can, be, isolated, in, the, crystalline, form, diazonium, salts, undergo, a, variety, of, useful, transformations, involving, replacement, of, the, n, 2, group, with, anions, for, example, cuprous, cyanide, gives, the, corresponding, nitriles, aryldiazoniums, couple, with, electron, rich, aromatic, compounds, such, as, a, phenol, to, form, azo, compounds, such, reactions, are, widely, applied, to, the, production, of, dyes, imine, formation, is, an, important, reaction, primary, amines, react, with, ketones, and, aldehydes, to, form, imines, in, the, case, of, formaldehyde, r, h, these, products, typically, exist, as, cyclic, trimers, rnh, 2, r, 2, c, o, r, 2, c, nr, h, 2, o, displaystyle, ce, rnh2, r, 2c, o, r, 2c, nr, h2o, reduction, of, these, imines, gives, secondary, amines, r, 2, c, nr, h, 2, r, 2, ch, nhr, displaystyle, ce, r, 2c, nr, h2, r, 2ch, nhr, similarly, secondary, amines, react, with, ketones, and, aldehydes, to, form, enamines, r, 2, nh, r, r, ch, 2, c, o, r, ch, c, nr, 2, r, h, 2, o, displaystyle, ce, r2nh, r, r, ch2, c, o, r, ch, c, nr2, r, h2o, mercuric, ions, reversibly, oxidize, tertiary, amines, with, an, hydrogen, to, iminium, ions, hg, 2, r, 2, nch, 2, r, hg, r, 2, n, chr, h, displaystyle, ce, hg, 2, r2nch2r, hg, h, an, overview, of, the, reactions, of, amines, is, given, below, amines, are, ubiquitous, in, biology, the, breakdown, of, amino, acids, releases, amines, famously, in, the, case, of, decaying, fish, which, smell, of, trimethylamine, many, neurotransmitters, are, amines, including, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and, histamine, protonated, amino, groups, nh, 3, are, the, most, common, positively, charged, moieties, in, proteins, specifically, in, the, amino, acid, lysine, the, anionic, polymer, dna, is, typically, bound, to, various, amine, rich, proteins, additionally, the, terminal, charged, primary, ammonium, on, lysine, forms, salt, bridges, with, carboxylate, groups, of, other, amino, acids, in, polypeptides, which, is, one, of, the, primary, influences, on, the, three, dimensional, structures, of, proteins, hormones, derived, from, the, modification, of, amino, acids, are, referred, to, as, amine, hormones, typically, the, original, structure, of, the, amino, acid, is, modified, such, that, a, cooh, or, carboxyl, group, is, removed, whereas, the, nh, 3, or, amine, group, remains, amine, hormones, are, synthesized, from, the, amino, acids, tryptophan, or, tyrosine, primary, aromatic, amines, are, used, as, a, starting, material, for, the, manufacture, of, azo, dyes, it, reacts, with, nitrous, acid, to, form, diazonium, salt, which, can, undergo, coupling, reaction, to, form, an, azo, compound, as, azo, compounds, are, highly, coloured, they, are, widely, used, in, dyeing, industries, such, as, most, drugs, and, drug, candidates, contain, amine, functional, groups, aqueous, monoethanolamine, mea, diglycolamine, dga, diethanolamine, dea, diisopropanolamine, dipa, and, methyldiethanolamine, mdea, are, widely, used, industrially, for, removing, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, from, natural, gas, and, refinery, process, streams, they, may, also, be, used, to, remove, co, 2, from, combustion, gases, and, flue, gases, and, may, have, potential, for, abatement, of, greenhouse, gases, related, processes, are, known, as, sweetening, amines, are, often, used, as, epoxy, resin, curing, agents, these, include, dimethylethylamine, cyclohexylamine, and, a, variety, of, diamines, such, as, 4, 4, diaminodicyclohexylmethane, multifunctional, amines, such, as, tetraethylenepentamine, and, triethylenetetramine, are, also, widely, used, in, this, capacity, the, reaction, proceeds, by, the, lone, pair, of, electrons, on, the, amine, nitrogen, attacking, the, outermost, carbon, on, the, oxirane, ring, of, the, epoxy, resin, this, relieves, ring, strain, on, the, epoxide, and, is, the, driving, force, of, the, reaction, molecules, with, tertiary, amine, functionality, are, often, used, to, accelerate, the, epoxy, amine, curing, reaction, and, include, substances, such, as, 2, 4, 6, tris, dimethylaminomethyl, phenol, it, has, been, stated, that, this, is, the, most, widely, used, room, temperature, accelerator, for, two, component, epoxy, resin, systems, low, molecular, weight, simple, amines, such, as, ethylamine, are, only, weakly, toxic, with, ld, 50, between, 100, and, 1000, mg, kg, they, are, skin, irritants, especially, as, some, are, easily, absorbed, through, the, skin, amines, are, a, broad, class, of, compounds, and, more, complex, members, of, the, class, can, be, extremely, bioactive, for, example, strychnine
