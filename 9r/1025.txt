a, beta, particle, also, called, beta, ray, or, beta, radiation, symbol, is, a, high, energy, high, speed, electron, or, positron, emitted, by, the, radioactive, decay, of, an, atomic, nucleus, known, as, beta, decay, there, are, two, forms, of, beta, decay, decay, and, decay, which, produce, electrons, and, positrons, respectively, beta, particles, with, an, energy, of, 0, 5, mev, have, a, range, of, about, one, metre, in, the, air, the, distance, is, dependent, on, the, particle, s, energy, and, the, air, s, density, and, composition, beta, particles, are, a, type, of, ionizing, radiation, and, for, radiation, protection, purposes, they, are, regarded, as, being, more, ionising, than, gamma, rays, but, less, ionising, than, alpha, particles, the, higher, the, ionising, effect, the, greater, the, damage, to, living, tissue, but, also, the, lower, the, penetrating, power, of, the, radiation, through, matter, an, unstable, atomic, nucleus, with, an, excess, of, neutrons, may, undergo, decay, where, a, neutron, is, converted, into, a, proton, an, electron, and, an, electron, antineutrino, the, antiparticle, of, the, neutrino, this, process, is, mediated, by, the, weak, interaction, the, neutron, turns, into, a, proton, through, the, emission, of, a, virtual, w, boson, at, the, quark, level, w, emission, turns, a, down, quark, into, an, up, quark, turning, a, neutron, one, up, quark, and, two, down, quarks, into, a, proton, two, up, quarks, and, one, down, quark, the, virtual, w, boson, then, decays, into, an, electron, and, an, antineutrino, decay, commonly, occurs, among, the, neutron, rich, fission, byproducts, produced, in, nuclear, reactors, free, neutrons, also, decay, via, this, process, both, of, these, processes, contribute, to, the, copious, quantities, of, beta, rays, and, electron, antineutrinos, produced, by, fission, reactor, fuel, rods, unstable, atomic, nuclei, with, an, excess, of, protons, may, undergo, decay, also, called, positron, decay, where, a, proton, is, converted, into, a, neutron, a, positron, and, an, electron, neutrino, beta, plus, decay, can, only, happen, inside, nuclei, when, the, absolute, value, of, the, binding, energy, of, the, daughter, nucleus, is, greater, than, that, of, the, parent, nucleus, i, e, the, daughter, nucleus, is, a, lower, energy, state, the, accompanying, decay, scheme, diagram, shows, the, beta, decay, of, caesium, 137, 137, cs, is, noted, for, a, characteristic, gamma, peak, at, 661, kev, but, this, is, actually, emitted, by, the, daughter, radionuclide, 137m, ba, the, diagram, shows, the, type, and, energy, of, the, emitted, radiation, its, relative, abundance, and, the, daughter, nuclides, after, decay, phosphorus, 32, is, a, beta, emitter, widely, used, in, medicine, it, has, a, short, half, life, of, 14, 29, days, and, decays, into, sulfur, 32, by, beta, decay, as, shown, in, this, nuclear, equation, 1, 709, mev, of, energy, is, released, during, the, decay, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, electron, varies, with, an, average, of, approximately, 0, 5, mev, and, the, remainder, of, the, energy, is, carried, by, the, nearly, undetectable, electron, antineutrino, in, comparison, to, other, beta, radiation, emitting, nuclides, the, electron, is, moderately, energetic, it, is, blocked, by, around, 1, m, of, air, or, 5, mm, of, acrylic, glass, of, the, three, common, types, of, radiation, given, off, by, radioactive, materials, alpha, beta, and, gamma, beta, has, the, medium, penetrating, power, and, the, medium, ionising, power, although, the, beta, particles, given, off, by, different, radioactive, materials, vary, in, energy, most, beta, particles, can, be, stopped, by, a, few, millimeters, of, aluminium, however, this, does, not, mean, that, beta, emitting, isotopes, can, be, completely, shielded, by, such, thin, shields, as, they, decelerate, in, matter, beta, electrons, emit, secondary, gamma, rays, which, are, more, penetrating, than, betas, per, se, shielding, composed, of, materials, with, lower, atomic, weight, generates, gammas, with, lower, energy, making, such, shields, somewhat, more, effective, per, unit, mass, than, ones, made, of, larger, atoms, such, as, lead, being, composed, of, charged, particles, beta, radiation, is, more, strongly, ionizing, than, gamma, radiation, when, passing, through, matter, a, beta, particle, is, decelerated, by, electromagnetic, interactions, and, may, give, off, bremsstrahlung, x, rays, in, water, beta, radiation, from, many, nuclear, fission, products, typically, exceeds, the, speed, of, light, in, that, material, which, is, about, 75, that, of, light, in, vacuum, and, thus, generates, blue, cherenkov, radiation, when, it, passes, through, water, the, intense, beta, radiation, from, the, fuel, rods, of, swimming, pool, reactors, can, thus, be, visualized, through, the, transparent, water, that, covers, and, shields, the, reactor, see, illustration, at, right, the, ionizing, or, excitation, effects, of, beta, particles, on, matter, are, the, fundamental, processes, by, which, radiometric, detection, instruments, detect, and, measure, beta, radiation, the, ionization, of, gas, is, used, in, ion, chambers, and, geiger, m, ller, counters, and, the, excitation, of, scintillators, is, used, in, scintillation, counters, the, following, table, shows, radiation, quantities, in, si, and, non, si, units, the, energy, contained, within, individual, beta, particles, is, measured, via, beta, spectrometry, the, study, of, the, obtained, distribution, of, energies, as, a, spectrum, is, beta, spectroscopy, determination, of, this, energy, is, done, by, measuring, the, amount, of, deflection, of, the, electron, s, path, under, a, magnetic, field, beta, particles, can, be, used, to, treat, health, conditions, such, as, eye, and, bone, cancer, and, are, also, used, as, tracers, strontium, 90, is, the, material, most, commonly, used, to, produce, beta, particles, beta, particles, are, also, used, in, quality, control, to, test, the, thickness, of, an, item, such, as, paper, coming, through, a, system, of, rollers, some, of, the, beta, radiation, is, absorbed, while, passing, through, the, product, if, the, product, is, made, too, thick, or, thin, a, correspondingly, different, amount, of, radiation, will, be, absorbed, a, computer, program, monitoring, the, quality, of, the, manufactured, paper, will, then, move, the, rollers, to, change, the, thickness, of, the, final, product, an, illumination, device, called, a, betalight, contains, tritium, and, a, phosphor, as, tritium, decays, it, emits, beta, particles, these, strike, the, phosphor, causing, the, phosphor, to, give, off, photons, much, like, the, cathode, ray, tube, in, a, television, the, illumination, requires, no, external, power, and, will, continue, as, long, as, the, tritium, exists, and, the, phosphors, do, not, themselves, chemically, change, the, amount, of, light, produced, will, drop, to, half, its, original, value, in, 12, 32, years, the, half, life, of, tritium, beta, plus, or, positron, decay, of, a, radioactive, tracer, isotope, is, the, source, of, the, positrons, used, in, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scan, henri, becquerel, while, experimenting, with, fluorescence, accidentally, found, out, that, uranium, exposed, a, photographic, plate, wrapped, with, black, paper, with, some, unknown, radiation, that, could, not, be, turned, off, like, x, rays, ernest, rutherford, continued, these, experiments, and, discovered, two, different, kinds, of, radiation, he, published, his, results, in, 1899, in, 1900, becquerel, measured, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, m, e, for, beta, particles, by, the, method, of, j, j, thomson, used, to, study, cathode, rays, and, identify, the, electron, he, found, that, e, m, for, a, beta, particle, is, the, same, as, for, thomson, s, electron, and, therefore, suggested, that, the, beta, particle, is, in, fact, an, electron, beta, particles, are, moderately, penetrating, in, living, tissue, and, can, cause, spontaneous, mutation, in, dna, beta, sources, can, be, used, in, radiation, therapy, to, kill, cancer, cells
