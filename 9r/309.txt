in, chemistry, a, radical, also, known, as, a, free, radical, is, an, atom, molecule, or, ion, that, has, at, least, one, unpaired, valence, electron, with, some, exceptions, these, unpaired, electrons, make, radicals, highly, chemically, reactive, many, radicals, spontaneously, dimerize, most, organic, radicals, have, short, lifetimes, a, notable, example, of, a, radical, is, the, hydroxyl, radical, ho, a, molecule, that, has, one, unpaired, electron, on, the, oxygen, atom, two, other, examples, are, triplet, oxygen, and, triplet, carbene, ch, 2, which, have, two, unpaired, electrons, radicals, may, be, generated, in, a, number, of, ways, but, typical, methods, involve, redox, reactions, ionizing, radiation, heat, electrical, discharges, and, electrolysis, are, known, to, produce, radicals, radicals, are, intermediates, in, many, chemical, reactions, more, so, than, is, apparent, from, the, balanced, equations, radicals, are, important, in, combustion, atmospheric, chemistry, polymerization, plasma, chemistry, biochemistry, and, many, other, chemical, processes, a, majority, of, natural, products, are, generated, by, radical, generating, enzymes, in, living, organisms, the, radicals, superoxide, and, nitric, oxide, and, their, reaction, products, regulate, many, processes, such, as, control, of, vascular, tone, and, thus, blood, pressure, they, also, play, a, key, role, in, the, intermediary, metabolism, of, various, biological, compounds, such, radicals, can, even, be, messengers, in, a, process, dubbed, redox, signaling, a, radical, may, be, trapped, within, a, solvent, cage, or, be, otherwise, bound, radicals, are, either, 1, formed, from, spin, paired, molecules, or, 2, from, other, radicals, radicals, are, formed, from, spin, paired, molecules, through, homolysis, of, weak, bonds, or, electron, transfer, also, known, as, reduction, radicals, are, formed, from, other, radicals, through, substitution, addition, and, elimination, reactions, homolysis, makes, two, new, radicals, from, a, spin, paired, molecule, by, breaking, a, covalent, bond, leaving, each, of, the, fragments, with, one, of, the, electrons, in, the, bond, because, breaking, a, chemical, bond, requires, energy, homolysis, occurs, under, the, addition, of, heat, or, light, the, bond, dissociation, energy, associated, with, homolysis, depends, on, the, stability, of, a, given, compound, and, some, weak, bonds, are, able, to, homolyze, at, relatively, lower, temperatures, some, homolysis, reactions, are, particularly, important, because, they, serve, as, an, initiator, for, other, radical, reactions, one, such, example, is, the, homolysis, of, halogens, which, occurs, under, light, and, serves, as, the, driving, force, for, radical, halogenation, reactions, another, notable, reaction, is, the, homolysis, of, dibenzoyl, peroxide, which, results, in, the, formation, of, two, benzoyloxy, radicals, and, acts, as, an, initiator, for, many, radical, reactions, classically, radicals, form, by, one, electron, reductions, typically, one, electron, reduced, organic, compounds, are, unstable, stability, is, conferred, to, the, radical, anion, when, the, charge, can, be, delocalized, examples, include, alkali, metal, naphthenides, anthracenides, and, ketyls, hydrogen, abstraction, generates, radicals, to, achieve, this, reaction, the, c, h, bond, of, the, h, atom, donor, must, be, weak, which, is, rarely, the, case, in, organic, compounds, allylic, and, especiall, doubly, allylic, c, h, bonds, are, prone, to, abstraction, by, o, 2, this, reaction, is, the, basis, of, drying, oils, such, as, linoleic, acid, derivatives, in, free, radical, additions, a, radical, adds, to, a, spin, paired, substrate, when, applied, to, organic, compounds, the, reaction, usually, entails, addition, to, an, alkene, this, addition, generates, a, new, radical, which, can, add, to, yet, another, alkene, etc, this, behavior, underpins, radical, polymerization, technology, that, produces, many, plastics, radical, elimination, can, be, viewed, as, the, reverse, of, radical, addition, in, radical, elimination, an, unstable, radical, compound, breaks, down, into, a, spin, paired, molecule, and, a, new, radical, compound, shown, below, is, an, example, of, a, radical, elimination, reaction, where, a, benzoyloxy, radical, breaks, down, into, a, phenyl, radical, and, a, carbon, dioxide, molecule, the, generation, and, reactivity, of, organic, radicals, are, dependent, on, both, their, thermodynamic, stability, and, the, kinetic, stability, also, known, as, the, persistency, this, distinction, is, necessary, because, these, two, types, of, stability, do, not, always, correlate, with, each, other, for, example, benzylic, radicals, which, is, known, for, its, weak, benzylic, c, h, bond, strength, are, thermodynamically, stabilized, due, to, resonance, delocalization, however, these, radicals, kinetically, transient, because, they, can, undergo, rapid, diffusion, limited, dimerization, resulting, in, a, lifetime, that, is, less, than, a, few, nanosecond, to, avoid, confusion, particularly, for, carbon, centered, radicals, griller, and, ingold, introduced, the, following, definitions, stabilized, should, be, used, to, describe, a, carbon, centered, radical, r, when, the, r, h, bond, strength, is, weaker, than, the, appropriate, c, h, bond, of, alkane, persistent, should, be, used, to, describe, a, radical, that, has, a, lifetime, that, is, significantly, greater, than, methyl, under, the, same, condition, while, relationships, between, thermodynamic, stability, and, kinetic, persistency, is, highly, case, dependent, organic, radicals, can, be, generally, stabilized, by, any, or, all, of, these, factors, presence, of, electronegativity, delocalization, and, steric, hindrance, the, compound, 2, 2, 6, 6, tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl, illustrates, the, combination, of, all, three, factors, it, is, a, commercially, available, solid, that, aside, from, being, magnetic, behaves, like, a, normal, organic, compound, organic, radicals, are, inherently, electron, deficient, thus, the, greater, the, electronegativity, of, the, atom, on, which, the, unpaired, electron, resides, the, less, stable, the, radical, between, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, for, example, carbon, is, the, most, stable, and, oxygen, the, least, stable, electronegativity, also, factors, into, the, stability, of, carbon, atoms, of, different, hybridizations, greater, s, character, correlates, to, higher, electronegativity, of, the, carbon, atom, due, to, the, close, proximity, of, s, orbitals, to, the, nucleus, and, the, greater, the, electronegativity, the, less, stable, a, radical, sp, hybridized, carbons, 50, s, character, form, the, least, stable, radicals, compared, to, sp, 3, hybridized, carbons, 25, s, character, which, form, the, most, stable, radicals, the, delocalization, of, electrons, across, the, structure, of, a, radical, also, known, as, its, ability, to, form, one, or, more, resonance, structures, allows, for, the, electron, deficiency, to, be, spread, over, several, atoms, minimizing, instability, delocalization, usually, occurs, in, the, presence, of, electron, donating, groups, such, as, hydroxyl, groups, oh, ethers, or, adjacent, alkenes, and, amines, nh, 2, or, nr, or, electron, withdrawing, groups, such, as, c, o, or, c, n, delocalization, effects, can, also, be, understood, using, molecular, orbital, theory, as, a, lens, more, specifically, by, examining, the, intramolecular, interaction, of, the, unpaired, electron, with, a, donating, group, s, pair, of, electrons, or, the, empty, orbital, of, an, electron, withdrawing, group, in, the, form, of, a, molecular, orbital, diagram, the, homo, of, a, radical, is, singly, occupied, hence, the, orbital, is, aptly, referred, to, as, the, somo, or, the, singly, occupied, molecular, orbital, for, an, electron, donating, group, the, somo, interacts, with, the, lower, energy, lone, pair, to, form, a, new, lower, energy, filled, bonding, orbital, and, a, singly, filled, new, somo, higher, in, energy, than, the, original, while, the, energy, of, the, unpaired, electron, has, increased, the, decrease, in, energy, of, the, lone, pair, forming, the, new, bonding, orbital, outweighs, the, increase, in, energy, of, the, new, somo, resulting, in, a, net, decrease, of, the, energy, of, the, molecule, therefore, electron, donating, groups, help, stabilize, radicals, with, a, group, that, is, instead, electron, withdrawing, the, somo, then, interacts, with, the, empty, orbital, there, are, no, electrons, occupying, the, higher, energy, orbital, formed, while, a, new, somo, forms, that, is, lower, in, energy, this, results, in, a, lower, energy, and, higher, stability, of, the, radical, species, both, donating, groups, and, withdrawing, groups, stabilize, radicals, another, well, known, albeit, weaker, form, of, delocalization, is, hyperconjugation, in, radical, chemistry, radicals, are, stabilized, by, hyperconjugation, with, adjacent, alkyl, groups, the, donation, of, sigma, c, h, bonds, into, the, partially, empty, radical, orbitals, helps, to, differentiate, the, stabilities, of, radicals, on, tertiary, secondary, and, primary, carbons, tertiary, carbon, radicals, have, three, c, h, bonds, that, donate, secondary, radicals, only, two, and, primary, radicals, only, one, therefore, tertiary, radicals, are, the, most, stable, and, primary, radicals, the, least, stable, most, simply, the, greater, the, steric, hindrance, the, more, difficult, it, is, for, reactions, to, take, place, and, the, radical, form, is, favored, by, default, for, example, compare, the, hydrogen, abstracted, form, of, n, hydroxypiperidine, to, the, molecule, tempo, tempo, or, 2, 2, 6, 6, tetramethylpiperidin, 1, yl, oxyl, is, too, sterically, hindered, by, the, additional, methyl, groups, to, react, making, it, stable, enough, to, be, sold, commercially, in, its, radical, form, n, hydroxypiperidine, however, does, not, have, the, four, methyl, groups, to, impede, the, way, of, a, reacting, molecule, so, the, structure, is, unstable, the, stability, of, many, or, most, organic, radicals, is, not, indicated, by, their, isolability, but, is, manifested, in, their, ability, to, function, as, donors, of, h, this, property, reflects, a, weakened, bond, to, hydrogen, usually, o, h, but, sometimes, n, h, or, c, h, this, behavior, is, important, because, these, h, donors, serve, as, antioxidants, in, biology, and, in, commerce, illustrative, is, tocopherol, vitamin, e, the, tocopherol, radical, itself, is, insufficiently, stable, for, isolation, but, the, parent, molecule, is, a, highly, effective, hydrogen, atom, donor, the, c, h, bond, is, weakened, in, triphenylmethyl, trityl, derivatives, a, large, variety, of, inorganic, radicals, are, stable, and, in, fact, isolable, examples, include, most, first, row, transition, metal, complexes, with, regard, to, main, group, radicals, the, most, abundant, radical, in, the, universe, is, also, the, most, abundant, chemical, in, the, universe, h, most, main, group, radicals, are, not, however, isolable, despite, their, intrinsic, stability, hydrogen, radicals, for, example, combine, eagerly, to, form, h, 2, nitric, oxide, no, is, well, known, example, of, an, isolable, inorganic, radical, fremy, s, salt, potassium, nitrosodisulfonate, kso, 3, 2, no, is, a, related, example, many, thiazyl, radicals, are, known, despite, limited, extent, of, resonance, stabilization, many, radicals, can, be, envisioned, as, the, products, of, breaking, of, covalent, bonds, by, homolysis, the, homolytic, bond, dissociation, energies, usually, abbreviated, as, h, are, a, measure, of, bond, strength, splitting, h, 2, into, 2, h, for, example, requires, a, h, of, 435, kj, mol, while, splitting, cl, 2, into, two, cl, requires, a, h, of, 243, kj, mol, for, weak, bonds, homolysis, can, be, induced, thermally, strong, bonds, require, high, energy, photons, or, even, flames, to, induce, homolysis, diradicals, are, molecules, containing, two, radical, centers, dioxygen, o, 2, is, an, important, example, of, a, stable, diradical, singlet, oxygen, the, lowest, energy, non, radical, state, of, dioxygen, is, less, stable, than, the, diradical, due, to, hund, s, rule, of, maximum, multiplicity, the, relative, stability, of, the, oxygen, diradical, is, primarily, due, to, the, spin, forbidden, nature, of, the, triplet, singlet, transition, required, for, it, to, grab, electrons, i, e, oxidize, the, diradical, state, of, oxygen, also, results, in, its, paramagnetic, character, which, is, demonstrated, by, its, attraction, to, an, external, magnet, diradicals, can, also, occur, in, metal, oxo, complexes, lending, themselves, for, studies, of, spin, forbidden, reactions, in, transition, metal, chemistry, carbenes, in, their, triplet, state, can, be, viewed, as, diradicals, centred, on, the, same, atom, while, these, are, usually, highly, reactive, persistent, carbenes, are, known, with, n, heterocyclic, carbenes, being, the, most, common, example, triplet, carbenes, and, nitrenes, are, diradicals, their, chemical, properties, are, distinct, from, the, properties, of, their, singlet, analogues, a, familiar, radical, reaction, is, combustion, the, oxygen, molecule, is, a, stable, diradical, best, represented, by, o, o, because, spins, of, the, electrons, are, parallel, this, molecule, is, stable, while, the, ground, state, of, oxygen, is, this, unreactive, spin, unpaired, triplet, diradical, an, extremely, reactive, spin, paired, singlet, state, is, available, for, combustion, to, occur, the, energy, barrier, between, these, must, be, overcome, this, barrier, can, be, overcome, by, heat, requiring, high, temperatures, the, triplet, singlet, transition, is, also, forbidden, this, presents, an, additional, barrier, to, the, reaction, it, also, means, molecular, oxygen, is, relatively, unreactive, at, room, temperature, except, in, the, presence, of, a, catalytic, heavy, atom, such, as, iron, or, copper, combustion, consists, of, various, radical, chain, reactions, that, the, singlet, radical, can, initiate, the, flammability, of, a, given, material, strongly, depends, on, the, concentration, of, radicals, that, must, be, obtained, before, initiation, and, propagation, reactions, dominate, leading, to, combustion, of, the, material, once, the, combustible, material, has, been, consumed, termination, reactions, again, dominate, and, the, flame, dies, out, as, indicated, promotion, of, propagation, or, termination, reactions, alters, flammability, for, example, because, lead, itself, deactivates, radicals, in, the, gasoline, air, mixture, tetraethyl, lead, was, once, commonly, added, to, gasoline, this, prevents, the, combustion, from, initiating, in, an, uncontrolled, manner, or, in, unburnt, residues, engine, knocking, or, premature, ignition, preignition, when, a, hydrocarbon, is, burned, a, large, number, of, different, oxygen, radicals, are, involved, initially, hydroperoxyl, radical, hoo, are, formed, these, then, react, further, to, give, organic, hydroperoxides, that, break, up, into, hydroxyl, radicals, ho, many, polymerization, reactions, are, initiated, by, radicals, polymerization, involves, an, initial, radical, adding, to, non, radical, usually, an, alkene, to, give, new, radicals, this, process, is, the, basis, of, the, radical, chain, reaction, the, art, of, polymerization, entails, the, method, by, which, the, initiating, radical, is, introduced, for, example, methyl, methacrylate, mma, can, be, polymerized, to, produce, poly, methyl, methacrylate, pmma, plexiglas, or, perspex, via, a, repeating, series, of, radical, addition, steps, newer, radical, polymerization, methods, are, known, as, living, radical, polymerization, variants, include, reversible, addition, fragmentation, chain, transfer, raft, and, atom, transfer, radical, polymerization, atrp, being, a, prevalent, radical, o, 2, reacts, with, many, organic, compounds, to, generate, radicals, together, with, the, hydroperoxide, radical, drying, oils, and, alkyd, paints, harden, due, to, radical, crosslinking, initiated, by, oxygen, from, the, atmosphere, the, most, common, radical, in, the, lower, atmosphere, is, molecular, dioxygen, photodissociation, of, source, molecules, produces, other, radicals, in, the, lower, atmosphere, important, radical, are, produced, by, the, photodissociation, of, nitrogen, dioxide, to, an, oxygen, atom, and, nitric, oxide, see, eq, 1, 1, below, which, plays, a, key, role, in, smog, formation, and, the, photodissociation, of, ozone, to, give, the, excited, oxygen, atom, o, 1d, see, eq, 1, 2, below, the, net, and, return, reactions, are, also, shown, eq, 1, 3, and, eq, 1, 4, respectively, in, the, upper, atmosphere, the, photodissociation, of, normally, unreactive, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, by, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, is, an, important, source, of, radicals, see, eq, 1, below, these, reactions, give, the, chlorine, radical, cl, which, catalyzes, the, conversion, of, ozone, to, o, 2, thus, facilitating, ozone, depletion, eq, 2, 2, eq, 2, 4, below, such, reactions, cause, the, depletion, of, the, ozone, layer, especially, since, the, chlorine, radical, is, free, to, engage, in, another, reaction, chain, consequently, the, use, of, chlorofluorocarbons, as, refrigerants, has, been, restricted, radicals, play, important, roles, in, biology, many, of, these, are, necessary, for, life, such, as, the, intracellular, killing, of, bacteria, by, phagocytic, cells, such, as, granulocytes, and, macrophages, radicals, are, involved, in, cell, signalling, processes, known, as, redox, signaling, for, example, radical, attack, of, linoleic, acid, produces, a, series, of, 13, hydroxyoctadecadienoic, acids, and, 9, hydroxyoctadecadienoic, acids, which, may, act, to, regulate, localized, tissue, inflammatory, and, or, healing, responses, pain, perception, and, the, proliferation, of, malignant, cells, radical, attacks, on, arachidonic, acid, and, docosahexaenoic, acid, produce, a, similar, but, broader, array, of, signaling, products, radicals, may, also, be, involved, in, parkinson, s, disease, senile, and, drug, induced, deafness, schizophrenia, and, alzheimer, s, the, classic, free, radical, syndrome, the, iron, storage, disease, hemochromatosis, is, typically, associated, with, a, constellation, of, free, radical, related, symptoms, including, movement, disorder, psychosis, skin, pigmentary, melanin, abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and, diabetes, mellitus, the, free, radical, theory, of, aging, proposes, that, radicals, underlie, the, aging, process, itself, similarly, the, process, of, mito, hormesis, suggests, that, repeated, exposure, to, radicals, may, extend, life, span, because, radicals, are, necessary, for, life, the, body, has, a, number, of, mechanisms, to, minimize, radical, induced, damage, and, to, repair, damage, that, occurs, such, as, the, enzymes, superoxide, dismutase, catalase, glutathione, peroxidase, and, glutathione, reductase, in, addition, antioxidants, play, a, key, role, in, these, defense, mechanisms, these, are, often, the, three, vitamins, vitamin, a, vitamin, c, and, vitamin, e, and, polyphenol, antioxidants, furthermore, there, is, good, evidence, indicating, that, bilirubin, and, uric, acid, can, act, as, antioxidants, to, help, neutralize, certain, radicals, bilirubin, comes, from, the, breakdown, of, red, blood, cells, contents, while, uric, acid, is, a, breakdown, product, of, purines, too, much, bilirubin, though, can, lead, to, jaundice, which, could, eventually, damage, the, central, nervous, system, while, too, much, uric, acid, causes, gout, reactive, oxygen, species, or, ros, are, species, such, as, superoxide, hydrogen, peroxide, and, hydroxyl, radical, commonly, associated, with, cell, damage, ros, form, as, a, natural, by, product, of, the, normal, metabolism, of, oxygen, and, have, important, roles, in, cell, signaling, two, important, oxygen, centered, radicals, are, superoxide, and, hydroxyl, radical, they, derive, from, molecular, oxygen, under, reducing, conditions, however, because, of, their, reactivity, these, same, radicals, can, participate, in, unwanted, side, reactions, resulting, in, cell, damage, excessive, amounts, of, these, radicals, can, lead, to, cell, injury, and, death, which, may, contribute, to, many, diseases, such, as, cancer, stroke, myocardial, infarction, diabetes, and, major, disorders, many, forms, of, cancer, are, thought, to, be, the, result, of, reactions, between, radicals, and, dna, potentially, resulting, in, mutations, that, can, adversely, affect, the, cell, cycle, and, potentially, lead, to, malignancy, some, of, the, symptoms, of, aging, such, as, atherosclerosis, are, also, attributed, to, radical, induced, oxidation, of, cholesterol, to, 7, ketocholesterol, in, addition, radicals, contribute, to, alcohol, induced, liver, damage, perhaps, more, than, alcohol, itself, radicals, produced, by, cigarette, smoke, are, implicated, in, inactivation, of, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, in, the, lung, this, process, promotes, the, development, of, emphysema, oxybenzone, has, been, found, to, form, radicals, in, sunlight, and, therefore, may, be, associated, with, cell, damage, as, well, this, only, occurred, when, it, was, combined, with, other, ingredients, commonly, found, in, sunscreens, like, titanium, oxide, and, octyl, methoxycinnamate, ros, attack, the, polyunsaturated, fatty, acid, linoleic, acid, to, form, a, series, of, 13, hydroxyoctadecadienoic, acid, and, 9, hydroxyoctadecadienoic, acid, products, that, serve, as, signaling, molecules, that, may, trigger, responses, that, counter, the, tissue, injury, which, caused, their, formation, ros, attacks, other, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, e, g, arachidonic, acid, and, docosahexaenoic, acid, to, produce, a, similar, series, of, signaling, products, reactive, oxygen, species, are, also, used, in, controlled, reactions, involving, singlet, dioxygen, 1, o, 2, displaystyle, 1, mathrm, o, 2, known, as, type, ii, photooxygenation, reactions, after, dexter, energy, transfer, triplet, triplet, annihilation, from, natural, triplet, dioxygen, 3, o, 2, displaystyle, 3, mathrm, o, 2, and, triplet, excited, state, of, a, photosensitizer, typical, chemical, transformations, with, this, singlet, dioxygen, species, involve, among, others, conversion, of, cellulosic, biowaste, into, new, poylmethine, dyes, until, late, in, the, 20th, century, the, word, radical, was, used, in, chemistry, to, indicate, any, connected, group, of, atoms, such, as, a, methyl, group, or, a, carboxyl, whether, it, was, part, of, a, larger, molecule, or, a, molecule, on, its, own, a, radical, is, often, known, as, an, r, group, the, qualifier, free, was, then, needed, to, specify, the, unbound, case, following, recent, nomenclature, revisions, a, part, of, a, larger, molecule, is, now, called, a, functional, group, or, substituent, and, radical, now, implies, free, however, the, old, nomenclature, may, still, appear, in, some, books, the, term, radical, was, already, in, use, when, the, now, obsolete, radical, theory, was, developed, louis, bernard, guyton, de, morveau, introduced, the, phrase, radical, in, 1785, and, the, phrase, was, employed, by, antoine, lavoisier, in, 1789, in, his, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, a, radical, was, then, identified, as, the, root, base, of, certain, acids, the, latin, word, radix, meaning, root, historically, the, term, radical, in, radical, theory, was, also, used, for, bound, parts, of, the, molecule, especially, when, they, remain, unchanged, in, reactions, these, are, now, called, functional, groups, for, example, methyl, alcohol, was, described, as, consisting, of, a, methyl, radical, and, a, hydroxyl, radical, neither, are, radicals, in, the, modern, chemical, sense, as, they, are, permanently, bound, to, each, other, and, have, no, unpaired, reactive, electrons, however, they, can, be, observed, as, radicals, in, mass, spectrometry, when, broken, apart, by, irradiation, with, energetic, electrons, in, a, modern, context, the, first, organic, carbon, containing, radical, identified, was, the, triphenylmethyl, radical, c, 6, h, 5, 3, c, this, species, was, discovered, by, moses, gomberg, in, 1900, in, 1933, morris, s, kharasch, and, frank, mayo, proposed, that, free, radicals, were, responsible, for, anti, markovnikov, addition, of, hydrogen, bromide, to, allyl, bromide, in, most, fields, of, chemistry, the, historical, definition, of, radicals, contends, that, the, molecules, have, nonzero, electron, spin, however, in, fields, including, spectroscopy, and, astrochemistry, the, definition, is, slightly, different, gerhard, herzberg, who, won, the, nobel, prize, for, his, research, into, the, electron, structure, and, geometry, of, radicals, suggested, a, looser, definition, of, free, radicals, any, transient, chemically, unstable, species, atom, molecule, or, ion, the, main, point, of, his, suggestion, is, that, there, are, many, chemically, unstable, molecules, that, have, zero, spin, such, as, c, 2, c, 3, ch, 2, and, so, on, this, definition, is, more, convenient, for, discussions, of, transient, chemical, processes, and, astrochemistry, therefore, researchers, in, these, fields, prefer, to, use, this, loose, definition, in, chemical, equations, radicals, are, frequently, denoted, by, a, dot, placed, immediately, to, the, right, of, the, atomic, symbol, or, molecular, formula, as, follows, radical, reaction, mechanisms, use, single, headed, arrows, to, depict, the, movement, of, single, electrons, the, homolytic, cleavage, of, the, breaking, bond, is, drawn, with, a, fish, hook, arrow, to, distinguish, from, the, usual, movement, of, two, electrons, depicted, by, a, standard, curly, arrow, the, second, electron, of, the, breaking, bond, also, moves, to, pair, up, with, the, attacking, radical, electron, radicals, also, take, part, in, radical, addition, and, radical, substitution, as, reactive, intermediates, chain, reactions, involving, radicals, can, usually, be, divided, into, three, distinct, processes, these, are, initiation, propagation, and, termination
