an, ion, a, n, n, is, an, atom, or, molecule, with, a, net, electrical, charge, the, charge, of, an, electron, is, considered, to, be, negative, by, convention, and, this, charge, is, equal, and, opposite, to, the, charge, of, a, proton, which, is, considered, to, be, positive, by, convention, the, net, charge, of, an, ion, is, not, zero, because, its, total, number, of, electrons, is, unequal, to, its, total, number, of, protons, a, cation, is, a, positively, charged, ion, with, fewer, electrons, than, protons, e, g, k, potassium, ion, while, an, anion, is, a, negatively, charged, ion, with, more, electrons, than, protons, e, g, cl, chloride, ion, and, oh, hydroxide, ion, opposite, electric, charges, are, pulled, towards, one, another, by, electrostatic, force, so, cations, and, anions, attract, each, other, and, readily, form, ionic, compounds, if, only, a, or, is, present, it, indicates, a, 1, or, 1, charge, 2, indicates, charge, 2, 2, indicates, charge, 2, 2, and, 2, charge, look, like, this, o, 2, 2, negative, charge, peroxide, he, 2, positive, charge, alpha, particle, ions, consisting, of, only, a, single, atom, are, termed, atomic, or, monatomic, ions, while, two, or, more, atoms, form, molecular, ions, or, polyatomic, ions, in, the, case, of, physical, ionization, in, a, fluid, gas, or, liquid, ion, pairs, are, created, by, spontaneous, molecule, collisions, where, each, generated, pair, consists, of, a, free, electron, and, a, positive, ion, ions, are, also, created, by, chemical, interactions, such, as, the, dissolution, of, a, salt, in, liquids, or, by, other, means, such, as, passing, a, direct, current, through, a, conducting, solution, dissolving, an, anode, via, ionization, the, word, ion, was, coined, from, neuter, present, participle, of, greek, ienai, meaning, to, go, a, cation, is, something, that, moves, down, greek, kato, meaning, down, and, an, anion, is, something, that, moves, up, greek, ano, meaning, up, they, are, so, called, because, ions, move, toward, the, electrode, of, opposite, charge, this, term, was, introduced, after, a, suggestion, by, the, english, polymath, william, whewell, by, english, physicist, and, chemist, michael, faraday, in, 1834, for, the, then, unknown, species, that, goes, from, one, electrode, to, the, other, through, an, aqueous, medium, faraday, did, not, know, the, nature, of, these, species, but, he, knew, that, since, metals, dissolved, into, and, entered, a, solution, at, one, electrode, and, new, metal, came, forth, from, a, solution, at, the, other, electrode, that, some, kind, of, substance, has, moved, through, the, solution, in, a, current, this, conveys, matter, from, one, place, to, the, other, in, correspondence, with, faraday, whewell, also, coined, the, words, anode, and, cathode, as, well, as, anion, and, cation, as, ions, that, are, attracted, to, the, respective, electrodes, svante, arrhenius, put, forth, in, his, 1884, dissertation, the, explanation, of, the, fact, that, solid, crystalline, salts, dissociate, into, paired, charged, particles, when, dissolved, for, which, he, would, win, the, 1903, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, arrhenius, explanation, was, that, in, forming, a, solution, the, salt, dissociates, into, faraday, s, ions, he, proposed, that, ions, formed, even, in, the, absence, of, an, electric, current, ions, in, their, gas, like, state, are, highly, reactive, and, will, rapidly, interact, with, ions, of, opposite, charge, to, give, neutral, molecules, or, ionic, salts, ions, are, also, produced, in, the, liquid, or, solid, state, when, salts, interact, with, solvents, for, example, water, to, produce, solvated, ions, which, are, more, stable, for, reasons, involving, a, combination, of, energy, and, entropy, changes, as, the, ions, move, away, from, each, other, to, interact, with, the, liquid, these, stabilized, species, are, more, commonly, found, in, the, environment, at, low, temperatures, a, common, example, is, the, ions, present, in, seawater, which, are, derived, from, dissolved, salts, as, charged, objects, ions, are, attracted, to, opposite, electric, charges, positive, to, negative, and, vice, versa, and, repelled, by, like, charges, when, they, move, their, trajectories, can, be, deflected, by, a, magnetic, field, electrons, due, to, their, smaller, mass, and, thus, larger, space, filling, properties, as, matter, waves, determine, the, size, of, atoms, and, molecules, that, possess, any, electrons, at, all, thus, anions, negatively, charged, ions, are, larger, than, the, parent, molecule, or, atom, as, the, excess, electron, s, repel, each, other, and, add, to, the, physical, size, of, the, ion, because, its, size, is, determined, by, its, electron, cloud, cations, are, smaller, than, the, corresponding, parent, atom, or, molecule, due, to, the, smaller, size, of, the, electron, cloud, one, particular, cation, that, of, hydrogen, contains, no, electrons, and, thus, consists, of, a, single, proton, much, smaller, than, the, parent, hydrogen, atom, anion, and, cation, indicate, the, net, electric, charge, on, an, ion, an, ion, that, has, more, electrons, than, protons, giving, it, a, net, negative, charge, is, named, an, anion, and, a, minus, indication, anion, indicates, the, negative, charge, with, a, cation, it, is, just, the, opposite, it, has, fewer, electrons, than, protons, giving, it, a, net, positive, charge, hence, the, indication, cation, since, the, electric, charge, on, a, proton, is, equal, in, magnitude, to, the, charge, on, an, electron, the, net, electric, charge, on, an, ion, is, equal, to, the, number, of, protons, in, the, ion, minus, the, number, of, electrons, an, anion, n, a, n, ann, eye, n, from, the, greek, word, n, meaning, up, is, an, ion, with, more, electrons, than, protons, giving, it, a, net, negative, charge, since, electrons, are, negatively, charged, and, protons, are, positively, charged, a, cation, k, t, a, n, kat, eye, n, from, the, greek, word, k, to, meaning, down, is, an, ion, with, fewer, electrons, than, protons, giving, it, a, positive, charge, there, are, additional, names, used, for, ions, with, multiple, charges, for, example, an, ion, with, a, 2, charge, is, known, as, a, dianion, and, an, ion, with, a, 2, charge, is, known, as, a, dication, a, zwitterion, is, a, neutral, molecule, with, positive, and, negative, charges, at, different, locations, within, that, molecule, cations, and, anions, are, measured, by, their, ionic, radius, and, they, differ, in, relative, size, cations, are, small, most, of, them, less, than, 10, 10, m, 10, 8, cm, in, radius, but, most, anions, are, large, as, is, the, most, common, earth, anion, oxygen, from, this, fact, it, is, apparent, that, most, of, the, space, of, a, crystal, is, occupied, by, the, anion, and, that, the, cations, fit, into, the, spaces, between, them, the, terms, anion, and, cation, for, ions, that, respectively, travel, to, the, anode, and, cathode, during, electrolysis, were, introduced, by, michael, faraday, in, 1834, following, his, consultation, with, william, whewell, ions, are, ubiquitous, in, nature, and, are, responsible, for, diverse, phenomena, from, the, luminescence, of, the, sun, to, the, existence, of, the, earth, s, ionosphere, atoms, in, their, ionic, state, may, have, a, different, color, from, neutral, atoms, and, thus, light, absorption, by, metal, ions, gives, the, color, of, gemstones, in, both, inorganic, and, organic, chemistry, including, biochemistry, the, interaction, of, water, and, ions, is, often, relevant, for, understanding, properties, of, systems, an, example, of, their, importance, is, in, the, breakdown, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, which, provides, the, energy, for, many, reactions, in, biological, systems, ions, can, be, non, chemically, prepared, using, various, ion, sources, usually, involving, high, voltage, or, temperature, these, are, used, in, a, multitude, of, devices, such, as, mass, spectrometers, optical, emission, spectrometers, particle, accelerators, ion, implanters, and, ion, engines, as, reactive, charged, particles, they, are, also, used, in, air, purification, by, disrupting, microbes, and, in, household, items, such, as, smoke, detectors, as, signalling, and, metabolism, in, organisms, are, controlled, by, a, precise, ionic, gradient, across, membranes, the, disruption, of, this, gradient, contributes, to, cell, death, this, is, a, common, mechanism, exploited, by, natural, and, artificial, biocides, including, the, ion, channels, gramicidin, and, amphotericin, a, fungicide, inorganic, dissolved, ions, are, a, component, of, total, dissolved, solids, a, widely, known, indicator, of, water, quality, the, ionizing, effect, of, radiation, on, a, gas, is, extensively, used, for, the, detection, of, radiation, such, as, alpha, beta, gamma, and, x, rays, the, original, ionization, event, in, these, instruments, results, in, the, formation, of, an, ion, pair, a, positive, ion, and, a, free, electron, by, ion, impact, by, the, radiation, on, the, gas, molecules, the, ionization, chamber, is, the, simplest, of, these, detectors, and, collects, all, the, charges, created, by, direct, ionization, within, the, gas, through, the, application, of, an, electric, field, the, geiger, m, ller, tube, and, the, proportional, counter, both, use, a, phenomenon, known, as, a, townsend, avalanche, to, multiply, the, effect, of, the, original, ionizing, event, by, means, of, a, cascade, effect, whereby, the, free, electrons, are, given, sufficient, energy, by, the, electric, field, to, release, further, electrons, by, ion, impact, when, writing, the, chemical, formula, for, an, ion, its, net, charge, is, written, in, superscript, immediately, after, the, chemical, structure, for, the, molecule, atom, the, net, charge, is, written, with, the, magnitude, before, the, sign, that, is, a, doubly, charged, cation, is, indicated, as, 2, instead, of, 2, however, the, magnitude, of, the, charge, is, omitted, for, singly, charged, molecules, atoms, for, example, the, sodium, cation, is, indicated, as, na, and, not, na, 1, an, alternative, and, acceptable, way, of, showing, a, molecule, atom, with, multiple, charges, is, by, drawing, out, the, signs, multiple, times, this, is, often, seen, with, transition, metals, chemists, sometimes, circle, the, sign, this, is, merely, ornamental, and, does, not, alter, the, chemical, meaning, all, three, representations, of, fe, 2, fe, and, fe, shown, in, the, figure, are, thus, equivalent, monatomic, ions, are, sometimes, also, denoted, with, roman, numerals, particularly, in, spectroscopy, for, example, the, fe, 2, positively, doubly, charged, example, seen, above, is, referred, to, as, fe, iii, fe, iii, or, fe, iii, fe, i, for, a, neutral, fe, atom, fe, ii, for, a, singly, ionized, fe, ion, the, roman, numeral, designates, the, formal, oxidation, state, of, an, element, whereas, the, superscripted, indo, arabic, numerals, denote, the, net, charge, the, two, notations, are, therefore, exchangeable, for, monatomic, ions, but, the, roman, numerals, cannot, be, applied, to, polyatomic, ions, however, it, is, possible, to, mix, the, notations, for, the, individual, metal, centre, with, a, polyatomic, complex, as, shown, by, the, uranyl, ion, example, if, an, ion, contains, unpaired, electrons, it, is, called, a, radical, ion, just, like, uncharged, radicals, radical, ions, are, very, reactive, polyatomic, ions, containing, oxygen, such, as, carbonate, and, sulfate, are, called, oxyanions, molecular, ions, that, contain, at, least, one, carbon, to, hydrogen, bond, are, called, organic, ions, if, the, charge, in, an, organic, ion, is, formally, centred, on, a, carbon, it, is, termed, a, carbocation, if, positively, charged, or, carbanion, if, negatively, charged, monatomic, ions, are, formed, by, the, gain, or, loss, of, electrons, to, the, valence, shell, the, outer, most, electron, shell, in, an, atom, the, inner, shells, of, an, atom, are, filled, with, electrons, that, are, tightly, bound, to, the, positively, charged, atomic, nucleus, and, so, do, not, participate, in, this, kind, of, chemical, interaction, the, process, of, gaining, or, losing, electrons, from, a, neutral, atom, or, molecule, is, called, ionization, atoms, can, be, ionized, by, bombardment, with, radiation, but, the, more, usual, process, of, ionization, encountered, in, chemistry, is, the, transfer, of, electrons, between, atoms, or, molecules, this, transfer, is, usually, driven, by, the, attaining, of, stable, closed, shell, electronic, configurations, atoms, will, gain, or, lose, electrons, depending, on, which, action, takes, the, least, energy, for, example, a, sodium, atom, na, has, a, single, electron, in, its, valence, shell, surrounding, 2, stable, filled, inner, shells, of, 2, and, 8, electrons, since, these, filled, shells, are, very, stable, a, sodium, atom, tends, to, lose, its, extra, electron, and, attain, this, stable, configuration, becoming, a, sodium, cation, in, the, process, on, the, other, hand, a, chlorine, atom, cl, has, 7, electrons, in, its, valence, shell, which, is, one, short, of, the, stable, filled, shell, with, 8, electrons, thus, a, chlorine, atom, tends, to, gain, an, extra, electron, and, attain, a, stable, 8, electron, configuration, becoming, a, chloride, anion, in, the, process, this, driving, force, is, what, causes, sodium, and, chlorine, to, undergo, a, chemical, reaction, wherein, the, extra, electron, is, transferred, from, sodium, to, chlorine, forming, sodium, cations, and, chloride, anions, being, oppositely, charged, these, cations, and, anions, form, ionic, bonds, and, combine, to, form, sodium, chloride, nacl, more, commonly, known, as, table, salt, polyatomic, and, molecular, ions, are, often, formed, by, the, gaining, or, losing, of, elemental, ions, such, as, a, proton, h, in, neutral, molecules, for, example, when, ammonia, nh, 3, accepts, a, proton, h, a, process, called, protonation, it, forms, the, ammonium, ion, nh, 4, ammonia, and, ammonium, have, the, same, number, of, electrons, in, essentially, the, same, electronic, configuration, but, ammonium, has, an, extra, proton, that, gives, it, a, net, positive, charge, ammonia, can, also, lose, an, electron, to, gain, a, positive, charge, forming, the, ion, nh, 3, however, this, ion, is, unstable, because, it, has, an, incomplete, valence, shell, around, the, nitrogen, atom, making, it, a, very, reactive, radical, ion, due, to, the, instability, of, radical, ions, polyatomic, and, molecular, ions, are, usually, formed, by, gaining, or, losing, elemental, ions, such, as, h, rather, than, gaining, or, losing, electrons, this, allows, the, molecule, to, preserve, its, stable, electronic, configuration, while, acquiring, an, electrical, charge, the, energy, required, to, detach, an, electron, in, its, lowest, energy, state, from, an, atom, or, molecule, of, a, gas, with, less, net, electric, charge, is, called, the, ionization, potential, or, ionization, energy, the, n, th, ionization, energy, of, an, atom, is, the, energy, required, to, detach, its, n, th, electron, after, the, first, n, 1, electrons, have, already, been, detached, each, successive, ionization, energy, is, markedly, greater, than, the, last, particularly, great, increases, occur, after, any, given, block, of, atomic, orbitals, is, exhausted, of, electrons, for, this, reason, ions, tend, to, form, in, ways, that, leave, them, with, full, orbital, blocks, for, example, sodium, has, one, valence, electron, in, its, outermost, shell, so, in, ionized, form, it, is, commonly, found, with, one, lost, electron, as, na, on, the, other, side, of, the, periodic, table, chlorine, has, seven, valence, electrons, so, in, ionized, form, it, is, commonly, found, with, one, gained, electron, as, cl, caesium, has, the, lowest, measured, ionization, energy, of, all, the, elements, and, helium, has, the, greatest, in, general, the, ionization, energy, of, metals, is, much, lower, than, the, ionization, energy, of, nonmetals, which, is, why, in, general, metals, will, lose, electrons, to, form, positively, charged, ions, and, nonmetals, will, gain, electrons, to, form, negatively, charged, ions, ionic, bonding, is, a, kind, of, chemical, bonding, that, arises, from, the, mutual, attraction, of, oppositely, charged, ions, ions, of, like, charge, repel, each, other, and, ions, of, opposite, charge, attract, each, other, therefore, ions, do, not, usually, exist, on, their, own, but, will, bind, with, ions, of, opposite, charge, to, form, a, crystal, lattice, the, resulting, compound, is, called, an, ionic, compound, and, is, said, to, be, held, together, by, ionic, bonding, in, ionic, compounds, there, arise, characteristic, distances, between, ion, neighbours, from, which, the, spatial, extension, and, the, ionic, radius, of, individual, ions, may, be, derived, the, most, common, type, of, ionic, bonding, is, seen, in, compounds, of, metals, and, nonmetals, except, noble, gases, which, rarely, form, chemical, compounds, metals, are, characterized, by, having, a, small, number, of, electrons, in, excess, of, a, stable, closed, shell, electronic, configuration, as, such, they, have, the, tendency, to, lose, these, extra, electrons, in, order, to, attain, a, stable, configuration, this, property, is, known, as, electropositivity, non, metals, on, the, other, hand, are, characterized, by, having, an, electron, configuration, just, a, few, electrons, short, of, a, stable, configuration, as, such, they, have, the, tendency, to, gain, more, electrons, in, order, to, achieve, a, stable, configuration, this, tendency, is, known, as, electronegativity, when, a, highly, electropositive, metal, is, combined, with, a, highly, electronegative, nonmetal, the, extra, electrons, from, the, metal, atoms, are, transferred, to, the, electron, deficient, nonmetal, atoms, this, reaction, produces, metal, cations, and, nonmetal, anions, which, are, attracted, to, each, other, to, form, a, salt
