temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forest, is, a, temperate, climate, terrestrial, habitat, type, defined, by, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, with, broadleaf, tree, ecoregions, and, with, conifer, and, broadleaf, tree, mixed, coniferous, forest, ecoregions, these, forests, are, richest, and, most, distinctive, in, central, china, and, eastern, north, america, with, some, other, globally, distinctive, ecoregions, in, the, himalayas, western, and, central, europe, the, southern, coast, of, the, black, sea, australasia, southwestern, south, america, and, the, russian, far, east, the, typical, structure, of, these, forests, includes, four, layers, in, the, northern, hemisphere, characteristic, dominant, broadleaf, trees, in, this, biome, include, oaks, quercus, spp, beeches, fagus, spp, maples, acer, spp, or, birches, betula, spp, the, term, mixed, forest, comes, from, the, inclusion, of, coniferous, trees, as, a, canopy, component, of, some, of, these, forests, typical, coniferous, trees, include, pines, pinus, spp, firs, abies, spp, and, spruces, picea, spp, in, some, areas, of, this, biome, the, conifers, may, be, a, more, important, canopy, species, than, the, broadleaf, species, in, the, southern, hemisphere, endemic, genera, such, as, nothofagus, and, eucalyptus, occupy, this, biome, and, most, coniferous, trees, members, of, the, araucariaceae, and, podocarpaceae, occur, in, mixtures, with, broadleaf, species, and, are, classed, as, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, occur, in, areas, with, distinct, warm, and, cool, seasons, including, climates, such, as, humid, continental, humid, subtropical, and, oceanic, that, give, them, moderate, annual, average, temperatures, 3, to, 23, c, 37, to, 73, f, these, forests, occur, in, relatively, warm, and, rainy, climates, sometimes, also, with, a, distinct, dry, season, a, dry, season, occurs, in, the, winter, in, east, asia, and, in, summer, on, the, wet, fringe, of, the, mediterranean, climate, zones, other, areas, such, as, central, eastern, north, america, have, a, fairly, even, distribution, of, rainfall, annual, rainfall, is, typically, over, 600, mm, 24, in, and, often, over, 1, 500, mm, 59, in, though, it, can, go, as, low, as, 300, mm, 12, in, in, some, parts, of, the, middle, east, and, close, to, 6, 000, mm, 240, in, in, the, mountains, of, new, zealand, and, the, azores, temperatures, are, typically, moderate, except, in, parts, of, asia, such, as, ussuriland, or, the, upper, midwest, where, temperate, forests, can, occur, despite, very, harsh, conditions, with, very, cold, winters, the, climates, are, typically, humid, for, much, of, the, year, usually, appearing, in, the, humid, subtropical, climate, and, in, the, humid, continental, climate, zones, to, the, south, of, tundra, and, the, generally, subarctic, taiga, in, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, they, are, represented, respectively, by, cfa, dfa, dfb, southern, range, and, cfb, and, more, rarely, csb, bsk, and, csa
