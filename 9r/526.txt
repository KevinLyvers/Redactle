aromatic, compounds, or, arenes, usually, refers, to, organic, compounds, with, a, chemistry, typified, by, benzene, and, cyclically, conjugated, the, word, aromatic, originates, from, the, past, grouping, of, molecules, based, on, odor, before, their, general, chemical, properties, were, understood, the, current, definition, of, aromatic, compounds, does, not, have, any, relation, to, their, odor, aromatic, compounds, are, now, defined, as, cyclic, compounds, satisfying, h, ckel, s, rule, aromatic, compounds, have, the, following, general, properties, arenes, are, typically, split, into, two, categories, benzoids, that, contain, a, benzene, derivative, and, follow, the, benzene, ring, model, and, non, benzoids, that, contain, other, aromatic, cyclic, derivatives, aromatic, compounds, are, commonly, used, in, organic, synthesis, and, are, involved, in, many, reaction, types, following, both, additions, and, removals, as, well, as, saturation, and, dearomatization, heteroarenes, are, aromatic, compounds, where, at, least, one, methine, or, vinylene, c, or, ch, ch, group, is, replaced, by, a, heteroatom, oxygen, nitrogen, or, sulfur, examples, of, non, benzene, compounds, with, aromatic, properties, are, furan, a, heterocyclic, compound, with, a, five, membered, ring, that, includes, a, single, oxygen, atom, and, pyridine, a, heterocyclic, compound, with, a, six, membered, ring, containing, one, nitrogen, atom, hydrocarbons, without, an, aromatic, ring, are, called, aliphatic, approximately, half, of, compounds, known, in, the, year, 2000, are, described, as, aromatic, to, some, extent, aromatic, compounds, are, pervasive, in, nature, and, industry, key, industrial, aromatic, hydrocarbons, are, benzene, toluene, xylene, called, btx, many, biomolecules, have, phenyl, groups, including, the, so, called, aromatic, amino, acids, benzene, c, 6, h, 6, is, the, least, complex, aromatic, hydrocarbon, and, it, was, the, first, one, defined, as, such, its, bonding, nature, was, first, recognized, independently, by, joseph, loschmidt, and, august, kekul, in, the, 19th, century, each, carbon, atom, in, the, hexagonal, cycle, has, four, electrons, to, share, one, electron, forms, a, sigma, bond, with, the, hydrogen, atom, and, one, is, used, in, covalently, bonding, to, each, of, the, two, neighboring, carbons, this, leaves, six, electrons, shared, equally, around, the, ring, in, delocalized, pi, molecular, orbitals, the, size, of, the, ring, itself, this, represents, the, equivalent, nature, of, the, six, carbon, carbon, bonds, all, of, bond, order, 1, 5, this, equivalency, can, also, explained, by, resonance, forms, the, electrons, are, visualized, as, floating, above, and, below, the, ring, with, the, electromagnetic, fields, they, generate, acting, to, keep, the, ring, flat, the, circle, symbol, for, aromaticity, was, introduced, by, sir, robert, robinson, and, his, student, james, armit, in, 1925, and, popularized, starting, in, 1959, by, the, morrison, boyd, textbook, on, organic, chemistry, the, proper, use, of, the, symbol, is, debated, some, publications, use, it, to, any, cyclic, system, while, others, use, it, only, for, those, systems, that, obey, h, ckel, s, rule, some, argue, that, in, order, to, stay, in, line, with, robinson, s, originally, intended, proposal, the, use, of, the, circle, symbol, should, be, limited, to, monocyclic, 6, electron, systems, in, this, way, the, circle, symbol, for, a, six, center, six, electron, bond, can, be, compared, to, the, y, symbol, for, a, three, center, two, electron, bond, benzene, derivatives, have, from, one, to, six, substituents, attached, to, the, central, benzene, core, examples, of, benzene, compounds, with, just, one, substituent, are, phenol, which, carries, a, hydroxyl, group, and, toluene, with, a, methyl, group, when, there, is, more, than, one, substituent, present, on, the, ring, their, spatial, relationship, becomes, important, for, which, the, arene, substitution, patterns, ortho, meta, and, para, are, devised, when, reacting, to, form, more, complex, benzene, derivatives, the, substituents, on, a, benzene, ring, can, be, described, as, either, activated, or, deactivated, which, are, electron, donating, and, electron, withdrawing, respectively, activators, are, known, as, ortho, para, directors, and, deactivators, are, known, as, meta, directors, upon, reacting, substituents, will, be, added, at, the, ortho, para, or, meta, positions, depending, on, the, directivity, of, the, current, substituents, to, make, more, complex, benzene, derivatives, often, with, several, isomers, electron, flow, leading, to, re, aromatization, is, key, in, ensuring, the, stability, of, such, products, for, example, three, isomers, exist, for, cresol, because, the, methyl, group, and, the, hydroxyl, group, both, ortho, para, directors, can, be, placed, next, to, each, other, ortho, one, position, removed, from, each, other, meta, or, two, positions, removed, from, each, other, para, given, that, both, the, methyl, and, hydroxyl, group, are, ortho, para, directors, the, ortho, and, para, isomers, are, typically, favoured, xylenol, has, two, methyl, groups, in, addition, to, the, hydroxyl, group, and, for, this, structure, 6, isomers, exist, arene, rings, can, stabilize, charges, as, seen, in, for, example, phenol, c, 6, h, 5, oh, which, is, acidic, at, the, hydroxyl, oh, as, charge, on, the, oxygen, alkoxide, o, is, partially, delocalized, into, the, benzene, ring, although, benzylic, arenes, are, common, non, benzylic, compounds, are, also, exceedingly, important, any, compound, containing, a, cyclic, portion, that, conforms, to, h, ckel, s, rule, and, is, not, a, benzene, derivative, can, be, considered, a, non, benzylic, aromatic, compound, of, annulenes, larger, than, benzene, annulene, and, annulene, are, weakly, aromatic, compounds, and, annulene, cyclooctadecanonaene, is, aromatic, though, strain, within, the, structure, causes, a, slight, deviation, from, the, precisely, planar, structure, necessary, for, aromatic, categorization, another, example, of, a, non, benzylic, monocyclic, arene, is, the, cyclopropenyl, cyclopropenium, cation, which, satisfies, h, ckel, s, rule, with, an, n, equal, to, 0, note, only, the, cationic, form, of, this, cyclic, propenyl, is, aromatic, given, that, neutrality, in, this, compound, would, violate, either, the, octet, rule, or, h, ckel, s, rule, other, non, benzylic, monocyclic, arenes, include, the, aforementioned, heteroarenes, that, can, replace, carbon, atoms, with, other, heteroatoms, such, as, n, o, or, s, common, examples, of, these, are, the, six, membered, pyrrole, and, five, membered, pyridine, both, of, which, have, a, substituted, nitrogen, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, also, known, as, polynuclear, aromatic, compounds, pahs, are, aromatic, hydrocarbons, that, consist, of, fused, aromatic, rings, and, do, not, contain, heteroatoms, or, carry, substituents, naphthalene, is, the, simplest, example, of, a, pah, pahs, occur, in, oil, coal, and, tar, deposits, and, are, produced, as, byproducts, of, fuel, burning, whether, fossil, fuel, or, biomass, as, pollutants, they, are, of, concern, because, some, compounds, have, been, identified, as, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and, teratogenic, pahs, are, also, found, in, cooked, foods, studies, have, shown, that, high, levels, of, pahs, are, found, for, example, in, meat, cooked, at, high, temperatures, such, as, grilling, or, barbecuing, and, in, smoked, fish, they, are, also, a, good, candidate, molecule, to, act, as, a, basis, for, the, earliest, forms, of, life, in, graphene, the, pah, motif, is, extended, to, large, 2d, sheets, aromatic, ring, systems, participate, in, many, organic, reactions, in, aromatic, substitution, one, substituent, on, the, arene, ring, usually, hydrogen, is, replaced, by, another, reagent, the, two, main, types, are, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, when, the, active, reagent, is, an, electrophile, and, nucleophilic, aromatic, substitution, when, the, reagent, is, a, nucleophile, in, radical, nucleophilic, aromatic, substitution, the, active, reagent, is, a, radical, an, example, of, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, is, the, nitration, of, salicylic, acid, where, a, nitro, group, is, added, para, to, the, hydroxide, substituent, nucleophilic, aromatic, substitution, involves, displacement, of, a, leaving, group, such, as, a, halide, on, an, aromatic, ring, aromatic, rings, usually, nucleophilic, but, in, the, presence, of, electron, withdrawing, groups, aromatic, compounds, undergo, nucleophilic, substitution, mechanistically, this, reaction, differs, from, a, common, s, n, 2, reaction, because, it, occurs, at, a, trigonal, carbon, atom, sp, 2, hybridization, hydrogenation, of, arenes, create, saturated, rings, the, compound, 1, naphthol, is, completely, reduced, to, a, mixture, of, decalin, ol, isomers, the, compound, resorcinol, hydrogenated, with, raney, nickel, in, presence, of, aqueous, sodium, hydroxide, forms, an, enolate, which, is, alkylated, with, methyl, iodide, to, 2, methyl, 1, 3, cyclohexandione, in, dearomatization, reactions, the, aromaticity, of, the, reactant, is, lost, in, this, regard, the, dearomatization, is, related, to, hydrogenation, a, classic, approach, is, birch, reduction, the, methodology, is, used, in, synthesis
