in, fluid, dynamics, drag, sometimes, referred, to, as, fluid, resistance, is, a, force, acting, opposite, to, the, relative, motion, of, any, object, moving, with, respect, to, a, surrounding, fluid, this, can, exist, between, two, fluid, layers, two, solid, surfaces, or, between, a, fluid, and, solid, surface, drag, forces, tend, to, decrease, fluid, velocity, relative, to, the, solid, object, in, the, fluid, s, path, unlike, other, resistive, forces, drag, force, depends, on, velocity, this, is, because, drag, force, is, proportional, to, the, velocity, of, low, speed, flow, and, the, squared, velocity, for, high, speed, flow, this, distinction, between, low, and, high, speed, flow, is, measured, by, the, reynolds, number, examples, of, drag, include, types, of, drag, are, generally, divided, into, the, following, categories, the, effect, of, streamlining, on, the, relative, proportions, of, skin, friction, and, form, drag, is, shown, for, two, different, body, sections, an, airfoil, which, is, a, streamlined, body, and, a, cylinder, which, is, a, bluff, body, also, shown, is, a, flat, plate, illustrating, the, effect, that, orientation, has, on, the, relative, proportions, of, skin, friction, and, pressure, difference, between, front, and, back, a, body, is, known, as, bluff, or, blunt, when, the, source, of, drag, is, dominated, by, pressure, forces, and, streamlined, if, the, drag, is, dominated, by, viscous, forces, for, example, road, vehicles, are, bluff, bodies, for, aircraft, pressure, and, friction, drag, are, included, in, the, definition, of, parasitic, drag, parasite, drag, is, often, expressed, in, terms, of, a, hypothetical, this, is, the, area, of, a, flat, plate, perpendicular, to, the, flow, it, is, used, when, comparing, the, drag, of, different, aircraft, for, example, the, douglas, dc, 3, has, an, equivalent, parasite, area, of, 2, 20, m, 2, 23, 7, sq, ft, and, the, mcdonnell, douglas, dc, 9, with, 30, years, of, advancement, in, aircraft, design, an, area, of, 1, 91, m, 2, 20, 6, sq, ft, although, it, carried, five, times, as, many, passengers, lift, induced, drag, also, called, induced, drag, is, drag, which, occurs, as, the, result, of, the, creation, of, lift, on, a, three, dimensional, lifting, body, such, as, the, wing, or, propeller, of, an, airplane, induced, drag, consists, primarily, of, two, components, drag, due, to, the, creation, of, trailing, vortices, vortex, drag, and, the, presence, of, additional, viscous, drag, lift, induced, viscous, drag, that, is, not, present, when, lift, is, zero, the, trailing, vortices, in, the, flow, field, present, in, the, wake, of, a, lifting, body, derive, from, the, turbulent, mixing, of, air, from, above, and, below, the, body, which, flows, in, slightly, different, directions, as, a, consequence, of, creation, of, lift, with, other, parameters, remaining, the, same, as, the, lift, generated, by, a, body, increases, so, does, the, lift, induced, drag, this, means, that, as, the, wing, s, angle, of, attack, increases, up, to, a, maximum, called, the, stalling, angle, the, lift, coefficient, also, increases, and, so, too, does, the, lift, induced, drag, at, the, onset, of, stall, lift, is, abruptly, decreased, as, is, lift, induced, drag, but, viscous, pressure, drag, a, component, of, parasite, drag, increases, due, to, the, formation, of, turbulent, unattached, flow, in, the, wake, behind, the, body, parasitic, drag, or, profile, drag, is, drag, caused, by, moving, a, solid, object, through, a, fluid, parasitic, drag, is, made, up, of, multiple, components, including, viscous, pressure, drag, form, drag, and, drag, due, to, surface, roughness, skin, friction, drag, additionally, the, presence, of, multiple, bodies, in, relative, proximity, may, incur, so, called, interference, drag, which, is, sometimes, described, as, a, component, of, parasitic, drag, in, aviation, induced, drag, tends, to, be, greater, at, lower, speeds, because, a, high, angle, of, attack, is, required, to, maintain, lift, creating, more, drag, however, as, speed, increases, the, angle, of, attack, can, be, reduced, and, the, induced, drag, decreases, parasitic, drag, however, increases, because, the, fluid, is, flowing, more, quickly, around, protruding, objects, increasing, friction, or, drag, at, even, higher, speeds, transonic, wave, drag, enters, the, picture, each, of, these, forms, of, drag, changes, in, proportion, to, the, others, based, on, speed, the, combined, overall, drag, curve, therefore, shows, a, minimum, at, some, airspeed, an, aircraft, flying, at, this, speed, will, be, at, or, close, to, its, optimal, efficiency, pilots, will, use, this, speed, to, maximize, endurance, minimum, fuel, consumption, or, maximize, gliding, range, in, the, event, of, an, engine, failure, drag, depends, on, the, properties, of, the, fluid, and, on, the, size, shape, and, speed, of, the, object, one, way, to, express, this, is, by, means, of, the, drag, equation, f, d, 1, 2, v, 2, c, d, a, displaystyle, f, d, tfrac, 1, 2, rho, v, 2, c, d, a, where, the, drag, coefficient, depends, on, the, shape, of, the, object, and, on, the, reynolds, number, r, e, v, d, v, d, displaystyle, r, e, frac, vd, nu, frac, rho, vd, mu, where, at, low, r, e, displaystyle, r, e, c, d, displaystyle, c, d, is, asymptotically, proportional, to, r, e, 1, displaystyle, r, e, 1, which, means, that, the, drag, is, linearly, proportional, to, the, speed, i, e, the, drag, force, on, a, small, sphere, moving, through, a, viscous, fluid, is, given, by, the, stokes, law, f, d, 3, d, v, displaystyle, f, rm, d, 3, pi, mu, dv, at, high, r, e, displaystyle, r, e, c, d, displaystyle, c, d, is, more, or, less, constant, but, drag, will, vary, as, the, square, of, the, speed, varies, the, graph, to, the, right, shows, how, c, d, displaystyle, c, d, varies, with, r, e, displaystyle, r, e, for, the, case, of, a, sphere, since, the, power, needed, to, overcome, the, drag, force, is, the, product, of, the, force, times, speed, the, power, needed, to, overcome, drag, will, vary, as, the, square, of, the, speed, at, low, reynolds, numbers, and, as, the, cube, of, the, speed, at, high, numbers, it, can, be, demonstrated, that, drag, force, can, be, expressed, as, a, function, of, a, dimensionless, number, which, is, dimensionally, identical, to, the, bejan, number, consequently, drag, force, and, drag, coefficient, can, be, a, function, of, bejan, number, in, fact, from, the, expression, of, drag, force, it, has, been, obtained, f, d, p, a, w, 1, 2, c, d, a, f, l, 2, r, e, l, 2, displaystyle, f, rm, d, delta, p, a, w, frac, 1, 2, c, d, a, f, frac, nu, mu, l, 2, re, l, 2, and, consequently, allows, expressing, the, drag, coefficient, c, d, displaystyle, c, d, as, a, function, of, bejan, number, and, the, ratio, between, wet, area, a, w, displaystyle, a, w, and, front, area, a, f, displaystyle, a, f, c, d, 2, a, w, a, f, b, e, r, e, l, 2, displaystyle, c, d, 2, frac, a, w, a, f, frac, be, re, l, 2, where, r, e, l, displaystyle, re, l, is, the, reynolds, number, related, to, fluid, path, length, l, as, mentioned, the, drag, equation, with, a, constant, drag, coefficient, gives, the, force, moving, through, fluid, a, relatively, large, velocity, i, e, high, reynolds, number, re, 1000, this, is, also, called, quadratic, drag, f, d, 1, 2, v, 2, c, d, a, displaystyle, f, d, tfrac, 1, 2, rho, v, 2, c, d, a, the, derivation, of, this, equation, is, presented, at, drag, equation, derivation, the, reference, area, a, is, often, the, orthographic, projection, of, the, object, or, the, frontal, area, on, a, plane, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, motion, for, objects, with, a, simple, shape, such, as, a, sphere, this, is, the, cross, sectional, area, sometimes, a, body, is, a, composite, of, different, parts, each, with, a, different, reference, area, drag, coefficient, corresponding, to, each, of, those, different, areas, must, be, determined, in, the, case, of, a, wing, the, reference, areas, are, the, same, and, the, drag, force, is, in, the, same, ratio, as, the, lift, force, therefore, the, reference, for, a, wing, is, often, the, lifting, area, sometimes, referred, to, as, wing, area, rather, than, the, frontal, area, for, an, object, with, a, smooth, surface, and, non, fixed, separation, points, like, a, sphere, or, circular, cylinder, the, drag, coefficient, may, vary, with, reynolds, number, r, e, up, to, extremely, high, values, r, e, of, the, order, 10, 7, for, an, object, with, well, defined, fixed, separation, points, like, a, circular, disk, with, its, plane, normal, to, the, flow, direction, the, drag, coefficient, is, constant, for, r, e, 3, 500, the, further, the, drag, coefficient, c, d, is, in, general, a, function, of, the, orientation, of, the, flow, with, respect, to, the, object, apart, from, symmetrical, objects, like, a, sphere, under, the, assumption, that, the, fluid, is, not, moving, relative, to, the, currently, used, reference, system, the, power, required, to, overcome, the, aerodynamic, drag, is, given, by, p, d, f, d, v, 1, 2, v, 3, a, c, d, displaystyle, p, d, mathbf, f, d, cdot, mathbf, v, tfrac, 1, 2, rho, v, 3, ac, d, the, power, needed, to, push, an, object, through, a, fluid, increases, as, the, cube, of, the, velocity, increases, for, example, a, car, cruising, on, a, highway, at, 50, mph, 80, km, h, may, require, only, 10, horsepower, 7, 5, kw, to, overcome, aerodynamic, drag, but, that, same, car, at, 100, mph, 160, km, h, requires, 80, hp, 60, kw, with, a, doubling, of, speeds, the, drag, force, quadruples, per, the, formula, exerting, 4, times, the, force, over, a, fixed, distance, produces, 4, times, as, much, work, at, twice, the, speed, the, work, resulting, in, displacement, over, a, fixed, distance, is, done, twice, as, fast, since, power, is, the, rate, of, doing, work, 4, times, the, work, done, in, half, the, time, requires, 8, times, the, power, when, the, fluid, is, moving, relative, to, the, reference, system, for, example, a, car, driving, into, headwind, the, power, required, to, overcome, the, aerodynamic, drag, is, given, by, the, following, formula, p, d, f, d, v, o, 1, 2, c, d, a, v, w, v, o, 2, v, o,

object, speed, both, relative, to, ground, velocity, as, a, function, of, time, for, an, object, falling, through, a, non, dense, medium, and, released, at, zero, relative, velocity, v, 0, at, time, t, 0, is, roughly, given, by, a, function, involving, a, hyperbolic, tangent, tanh, v, t, 2, m, g, a, c, d, tanh, t, g, c, d, a, 2, m, displaystyle, v, t, sqrt, frac, 2mg, rho, ac, d, tanh, left, t,

the, terminal, velocity, v, t, v, t, 2, m, g, a, c, d, displaystyle, v, t, sqrt, frac, 2mg, rho, ac, d, for, an, object, falling, and, released, at, relative, velocity, v, v, i, at, time, t, 0, with, v, i, v, t, is, also, defined, in, terms, of, the, hyperbolic, tangent, function, v, t, v, t, tanh, t, g, v, t, arctanh, v, i, v, t, displaystyle, v, t, v, t, tanh, left, t, frac, g, v, t,

short, terminal, velocity, is, higher, for, larger, creatures, and, thus, potentially, more, deadly, a, creature, such, as, a, mouse, falling, at, its, terminal, velocity, is, much, more, likely, to, survive, impact, with, the, ground, than, a, human, falling, at, its, terminal, velocity, the, equation, for, viscous, resistance, or, linear, drag, is, appropriate, for, objects, or, particles, moving, through, a, fluid, at, relatively, slow, speeds, assuming, there, is, no, turbulence, purely, laminar, flow, only, exists, up, to, re, 0, 1, under, this, definition, in, this, case, the, force, of, drag, is, approximately, proportional, to, velocity, the, equation, for, viscous, resistance, is, f, d, b, v, displaystyle, mathbf, f, d, b, mathbf, v, where, when, an, object, falls, from,

spherical, objects, moving, slowly, through, a, viscous, fluid, and, thus, at, small, reynolds, number, george, gabriel, stokes, derived, an, expression, for, the, drag, constant, b, 6, r,

is, known, as, stokes, drag, f, d, 6, r, v, displaystyle, mathbf, f, d, 6, pi, eta, r, mathbf, v, for, example, consider, a, small, sphere, with, radius, r, displaystyle, r, 0, 5, micrometre, diameter, 1, 0, m, moving, through, water, at, a, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, of, 10, m, s, using, 10, 3, pa, s, as, the, dynamic, viscosity, of, water, in, si, units, we, find, a, drag, force, of, 0, 09, pn, this, is, about, the, drag, force, that, a, bacterium, experiences, as, it, swims, through, water, the, drag, coefficient, of, a, sphere, can, be, determined, for, the, general, case, of, a, laminar, flow, with, reynolds, numbers, less, than, 2, 10, 5, displaystyle, 2, cdot, 10, 5, using, the, following, formula, c, d, 24, r, e, 4, r, e, 0, 4, r, e, 2, 10, 5, displaystyle, c, d, frac,

in, aerodynamics, aerodynamic, drag, also, known, as, air, resistance, is, the, fluid, drag, force, that, acts, on, any, moving, solid, body, in, the, direction, of, the, air, s, freestream, flow, alternatively, calculated, from, the, flow, field, perspective, far, field, approach, the, drag, force, results, from, three, natural, phenomena, shock, waves, vortex, sheet, and, viscosity, when, the, airplane, produces, lift, another, drag, component, results, induced, drag, symbolized, d, i, displaystyle, d, i, is, due, to, a, modification, of, the, pressure, distribution, due, to, the, trailing, vortex, system, that, accompanies, the, lift, production, an, alternative, perspective, on, lift, and, drag, is, gained, from, considering, the, change, of, momentum, of, the, airflow, the, wing, intercepts, the, airflow, and, forces, the, flow, to, move, downward, this, results, in, an, equal, and, opposite, force, acting, upward, on, the, wing, which, is, the, lift, force, the, change, of, momentum, of, the, airflow, downward, results, in, a, reduction, of, the, rearward, momentum, of, the, flow, which, is, the, result, of, a, force, acting, forward, on, the, airflow, and, applied, by, the, wing, to, the, air, flow, an, equal, but, opposite, force, acts, on, the, wing, rearward, which, is, the, induced, drag, another, drag, component, namely, wave, drag, d, w, displaystyle, d, w, results, from, shock, waves, in, transonic, and, supersonic, flight, speeds, the, shock, waves, induce, changes, in, the, boundary, layer, and, pressure, distribution, over, the, body, surface, therefore, there, are, three, ways, of, categorizing, drag, 19, the, pressure, distribution, acting, on, a, body, s, surface, exerts, normal, forces, on, the, body, those, forces, can, be, added, together, and, the, component, of, that, force, that, acts, downstream, represents, the, drag, force, d, p, r, displaystyle, d, pr, the, nature, of, these, normal, forces, combines, shock, wave, effects, vortex, system, generation, effects, and, wake, viscous, mechanisms, viscosity, of, the, fluid, has, a, major, effect, on, drag, in, the, absence, of, viscosity, the, pressure, forces, acting, to, hinder, the, vehicle, are, canceled, by, a, pressure, force, further, aft, that, acts, to, push, the, vehicle, forward, this, is, called, pressure, recovery, and, the, result, is, that, the, drag, is, zero, that, is, to, say, the, work, the, body, does, on, the, airflow, is, reversible, and, is, recovered, as, there, are, no, frictional, effects, to, convert, the, flow, energy, into, heat, pressure, recovery, acts, even, in, the, case, of, viscous, flow, viscosity, however, results, in, pressure, drag, and, it, is, the, dominant, component, of, drag, in, the, case, of, vehicles, with, regions, of, separated, flow, in, which, the, pressure, recovery, is, infective, the, friction, drag, force, which, is, a, tangential, force, on, the, aircraft, surface, depends, substantially, on, boundary, layer, configuration, and, viscosity, the, net, friction, drag, d, f, displaystyle, d, f, is, calculated, as, the, downstream, projection, of, the, viscous, forces, evaluated, over, the, body, s, surface, the, sum, of, friction, drag, and, pressure, form, drag, is, called, viscous, drag, this, drag, component, is, due, to, viscosity, the, idea, that, a, moving, body, passing, through, air, or, another, fluid, encounters, resistance, had, been, known, since, the, time, of, aristotle, according, to, mervyn, o, gorman, this, was, named, drag, by, archibald, reith, low, louis, charles, breguet, s, paper, of, 1922, began, efforts, to, reduce, drag, by, streamlining, breguet, went, on, to, put, his, ideas, into, practice, by, designing, several, record, breaking, aircraft, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, ludwig, prandtl, s, boundary, layer, theory, in, the, 1920s, provided, the, impetus, to, minimise, skin, friction, a, further, major, call, for, streamlining, was, made, by, sir, melvill, jones, who, provided, the, theoretical, concepts, to, demonstrate, emphatically, the, importance, of, streamlining, in, aircraft, design, in, 1929, his, paper, the, streamline, airplane, presented, to, the, royal, aeronautical, society, was, seminal, he, proposed, an, ideal, aircraft, that, would, have, minimal, drag, which, led, to, the, concepts, of, a, clean, monoplane, and, retractable, undercarriage, the, aspect, of, jones, s, paper, that, most, shocked, the, designers, of, the, time, was, his, plot, of, the, horse, power, required, versus, velocity, for, an, actual, and, an, ideal, plane, by, looking, at, a, data, point, for, a, given, aircraft, and, extrapolating, it, horizontally, to, the, ideal, curve, the, velocity, gain, for, the, same, power, can, be, seen, when, jones, finished, his, presentation, a, member, of, the, audience, described, the, results, as, being, of, the, same, level, of, importance, as, the, carnot, cycle, in, thermodynamics, the, interaction, of, parasitic, and, induced, drag, vs, airspeed, can, be, plotted, as, a, characteristic, curve, illustrated, here, in, aviation, this, is, often, referred, to, as, the, power, curve, and, is, important, to, pilots, because, it, shows, that, below, a, certain, airspeed, maintaining, airspeed, counterintuitively, requires, more, thrust, as, speed, decreases, rather, than, less, the, consequences, of, being, behind, the, curve, in, flight, are, important, and, are, taught, as, part, of, pilot, training, at, the, subsonic, airspeeds, where, the, u, shape, of, this, curve, is, significant, wave, drag, has, not, yet, become, a, factor, and, so, it, is, not, shown, in, the, curve, wave, drag, sometimes, referred, to, as, compressibility, drag, is, drag, that, is, created, when, a, body, moves, in, a, compressible, fluid, and, at, the, speed, that, is, close, to, the, speed, of, sound, in, that, fluid, in, aerodynamics, wave, drag, consists, of, multiple, components, depending, on, the, speed, regime, of, the, flight, in, transonic, flight, wave, drag, is, the, result, of, the, formation, of, shockwaves, in, the, fluid, formed, when, local, areas, of, supersonic, mach, number, greater, than, 1, 0, flow, are, created, in, practice, supersonic, flow, occurs, on, bodies, traveling, well, below, the, speed, of, sound, as, the, local, speed, of, air, increases, as, it, accelerates, over, the, body, to, speeds, above, mach, 1, 0, however, full, supersonic, flow, over, the, vehicle, will, not, develop, until, well, past, mach, 1, 0, aircraft, flying, at, transonic, speed, often, incur, wave, drag, through, the, normal, course, of, operation, in, transonic, flight, wave, drag, is, commonly, referred, to, as, transonic, compressibility, drag, transonic, compressibility, drag, increases, significantly, as, the, speed, of, flight, increases, towards, mach, 1, 0, dominating, other, forms, of, drag, at, those, speeds, in, supersonic, flight, mach, numbers, greater, than, 1, 0, wave, drag, is, the, result, of, shockwaves, present, in, the, fluid, and, attached, to, the, body, typically, oblique, shockwaves, formed, at, the, leading, and, trailing, edges, of, the, body, in, highly, supersonic, flows, or, in, bodies, with, turning, angles, sufficiently, large, unattached, shockwaves, or, bow, waves, will, instead, form, additionally, local, areas, of, transonic, flow, behind, the, initial, shockwave, may, occur, at, lower, supersonic, speeds, and, can, lead, to, the, development, of, additional, smaller, shockwaves, present, on, the, surfaces, of, other, lifting, bodies, similar, to, those, found, in, transonic, flows, in, supersonic, flow, regimes, wave, drag, is, commonly, separated, into, two, components, supersonic, lift, dependent, wave, drag, and, supersonic, volume, dependent, wave, drag, the, closed, form, solution, for, the, minimum, wave, drag, of, a, body, of, revolution, with, a, fixed, length, was, found, by, sears, and, haack, and, is, known, as, the, sears, haack, distribution, similarly, for, a, fixed, volume, the, shape, for, minimum, wave, drag, is, the, von, karman, ogive, the, busemann, biplane, theoretical, concept, is, not, subject, to, wave, drag, when, operated, at, its, design, speed, but, is, incapable, of, generating, lift, in, this, condition, in, 1752, d, alembert, proved, that, potential, flow, the, 18th, century, state, of, the, art, inviscid, flow, theory, amenable, to, mathematical, solutions, resulted, in, the, prediction, of, zero, drag, this, was, in, contradiction, with, experimental, evidence, and, became, known, as, d, alembert, s, paradox, in, the, 19th, century, the, navier, stokes, equations, for, the, description, of, viscous, flow, were, developed, by, saint, venant, navier, and, stokes, stokes, derived, the, drag, around, a, sphere, at, very, low, reynolds, numbers, the, result, of, which, is, called, stokes, law, in, the, limit, of, high, reynolds, numbers, the, navier, stokes, equations, approach, the, inviscid, euler, equations, of, which, the, potential, flow, solutions, considered, by, d, alembert, are, solutions, however, all, experiments, at, high, reynolds, numbers, showed, there, is, drag, attempts, to, construct, inviscid, steady, flow, solutions, to, the, euler, equations, other, than, the, potential, flow, solutions, did, not, result, in, realistic, results, the, notion, of, boundary, layers, introduced, by, prandtl, in, 1904, founded, on, both, theory, and, experiments, explained, the, causes, of, drag, at, high, reynolds, numbers, the, boundary, layer, is, the, thin, layer, of, fluid, close, to, the, object, s, boundary, where, viscous, effects, remain, important, even, when, the, viscosity, is, very, small, or, equivalently, the, reynolds, number, is, very, large
