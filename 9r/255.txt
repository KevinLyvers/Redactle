in, astronomy, stellar, classification, is, the, classification, of, stars, based, on, their, spectral, characteristics, electromagnetic, radiation, from, the, star, is, analyzed, by, splitting, it, with, a, prism, or, diffraction, grating, into, a, spectrum, exhibiting, the, rainbow, of, colors, interspersed, with, spectral, lines, each, line, indicates, a, particular, chemical, element, or, molecule, with, the, line, strength, indicating, the, abundance, of, that, element, the, strengths, of, the, different, spectral, lines, vary, mainly, due, to, the, temperature, of, the, photosphere, although, in, some, cases, there, are, true, abundance, differences, the, spectral, class, of, a, star, is, a, short, code, primarily, summarizing, the, ionization, state, giving, an, objective, measure, of, the, photosphere, s, temperature, most, stars, are, currently, classified, under, the, morgan, keenan, mk, system, using, the, letters, o, b, a, f, g, k, and, m, a, sequence, from, the, hottest, o, type, to, the, coolest, m, type, each, letter, class, is, then, subdivided, using, a, numeric, digit, with, 0, being, hottest, and, 9, being, coolest, e, g, a8, a9, f0, and, f1, form, a, sequence, from, hotter, to, cooler, the, sequence, has, been, expanded, with, three, classes, for, other, stars, that, do, not, fit, in, the, classical, system, w, s, and, c, some, non, stellar, objects, have, also, been, assigned, letters, d, for, white, dwarfs, and, l, t, and, y, for, brown, dwarfs, in, the, mk, system, a, luminosity, class, is, added, to, the, spectral, class, using, roman, numerals, this, is, based, on, the, width, of, certain, absorption, lines, in, the, star, s, spectrum, which, vary, with, the, density, of, the, atmosphere, and, so, distinguish, giant, stars, from, dwarfs, luminosity, class, 0, or, ia, is, used, for, hypergiants, class, i, for, supergiants, class, ii, for, bright, giants, class, iii, for, regular, giants, class, iv, for, subgiants, class, v, for, main, sequence, stars, class, sd, or, vi, for, subdwarfs, and, class, d, or, vii, for, white, dwarfs, the, full, spectral, class, for, the, sun, is, then, g2v, indicating, a, main, sequence, star, with, a, surface, temperature, around, 5, 800, k, the, conventional, colour, description, takes, into, account, only, the, peak, of, the, stellar, spectrum, in, actuality, however, stars, radiate, in, all, parts, of, the, spectrum, because, all, spectral, colours, combined, appear, white, the, actual, apparent, colours, the, human, eye, would, observe, are, far, lighter, than, the, conventional, colour, descriptions, would, suggest, this, characteristic, of, lightness, indicates, that, the, simplified, assignment, of, colours, within, the, spectrum, can, be, misleading, excluding, colour, contrast, effects, in, dim, light, in, typical, viewing, conditions, there, are, no, green, cyan, indigo, or, violet, stars, yellow, dwarfs, such, as, the, sun, are, white, red, dwarfs, are, a, deep, shade, of, yellow, orange, and, brown, dwarfs, do, not, literally, appear, brown, but, hypothetically, would, appear, dim, red, or, grey, black, to, a, nearby, observer, the, modern, classification, system, is, known, as, the, morgan, keenan, mk, classification, each, star, is, assigned, a, spectral, class, from, the, older, harvard, spectral, classification, which, did, not, include, luminosity, and, a, luminosity, class, using, roman, numerals, as, explained, below, forming, the, star, s, spectral, type, other, modern, stellar, classification, systems, such, as, the, ubv, system, are, based, on, color, indices, the, measured, differences, in, three, or, more, color, magnitudes, those, numbers, are, given, labels, such, as, u, v, or, b, v, which, represent, the, colors, passed, by, two, standard, filters, e, g, u, ltraviolet, b, lue, and, v, isual, the, harvard, system, is, a, one, dimensional, classification, scheme, by, astronomer, annie, jump, cannon, who, re, ordered, and, simplified, the, prior, alphabetical, system, by, draper, see, history, stars, are, grouped, according, to, their, spectral, characteristics, by, single, letters, of, the, alphabet, optionally, with, numeric, subdivisions, main, sequence, stars, vary, in, surface, temperature, from, approximately, 2, 000, to, 50, 000, k, whereas, more, evolved, stars, can, have, temperatures, above, 100, 000, k, physically, the, classes, indicate, the, temperature, of, the, star, s, atmosphere, and, are, normally, listed, from, hottest, to, coldest, a, common, mnemonic, for, remembering, the, order, of, the, spectral, type, letters, from, hottest, to, coolest, is, o, h, b, e, a, f, ine, g, uy, g, irl, k, iss, m, e, or, another, one, is, o, ur, b, right, a, stronomers, f, requently, g, enerate, k, iller, m, nemonics, the, spectral, classes, o, through, m, as, well, as, other, more, specialized, classes, discussed, later, are, subdivided, by, arabic, numerals, 0, 9, where, 0, denotes, the, hottest, stars, of, a, given, class, for, example, a0, denotes, the, hottest, stars, in, class, a, and, a9, denotes, the, coolest, ones, fractional, numbers, are, allowed, for, example, the, star, mu, normae, is, classified, as, o9, 7, the, sun, is, classified, as, g2, the, fact, that, the, harvard, classification, of, a, star, indicated, its, surface, or, photospheric, temperature, or, more, precisely, its, effective, temperature, was, not, fully, understood, until, after, its, development, though, by, the, time, the, first, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, was, formulated, by, 1914, this, was, generally, suspected, to, be, true, in, the, 1920s, the, indian, physicist, meghnad, saha, derived, a, theory, of, ionization, by, extending, well, known, ideas, in, physical, chemistry, pertaining, to, the, dissociation, of, molecules, to, the, ionization, of, atoms, first, he, applied, it, to, the, solar, chromosphere, then, to, stellar, spectra, harvard, astronomer, cecilia, payne, then, demonstrated, that, the, o, b, a, f, g, k, m, spectral, sequence, is, actually, a, sequence, in, temperature, because, the, classification, sequence, predates, our, understanding, that, it, is, a, temperature, sequence, the, placement, of, a, spectrum, into, a, given, subtype, such, as, b3, or, a7, depends, upon, largely, subjective, estimates, of, the, strengths, of, absorption, features, in, stellar, spectra, as, a, result, these, subtypes, are, not, evenly, divided, into, any, sort, of, mathematically, representable, intervals, the, yerkes, spectral, classification, also, called, the, mk, or, morgan, keenan, alternatively, referred, to, as, the, mkk, or, morgan, keenan, kellman, system, from, the, authors, initials, is, a, system, of, stellar, spectral, classification, introduced, in, 1943, by, william, wilson, morgan, philip, c, keenan, and, edith, kellman, from, yerkes, observatory, this, two, dimensional, temperature, and, luminosity, classification, scheme, is, based, on, spectral, lines, sensitive, to, stellar, temperature, and, surface, gravity, which, is, related, to, luminosity, whilst, the, harvard, classification, is, based, on, just, surface, temperature, later, in, 1953, after, some, revisions, to, the, list, of, standard, stars, and, classification, criteria, the, scheme, was, named, the, morgan, keenan, classification, or, mk, which, remains, in, use, today, denser, stars, with, higher, surface, gravity, exhibit, greater, pressure, broadening, of, spectral, lines, the, gravity, and, hence, the, pressure, on, the, surface, of, a, giant, star, is, much, lower, than, for, a, dwarf, star, because, the, radius, of, the, giant, is, much, greater, than, a, dwarf, of, similar, mass, therefore, differences, in, the, spectrum, can, be, interpreted, as, luminosity, effects, and, a, luminosity, class, can, be, assigned, purely, from, examination, of, the, spectrum, a, number, of, different, luminosity, classes, are, distinguished, as, listed, in, the, table, below, marginal, cases, are, allowed, for, example, a, star, may, be, either, a, supergiant, or, a, bright, giant, or, may, be, in, between, the, subgiant, and, main, sequence, classifications, in, these, cases, two, special, symbols, are, used, for, example, a, star, classified, as, a3, 4iii, iv, would, be, in, between, spectral, types, a3, and, a4, while, being, either, a, giant, star, or, a, subgiant, sub, dwarf, classes, have, also, been, used, vi, for, sub, dwarfs, stars, slightly, less, luminous, than, the, main, sequence, nominal, luminosity, class, vii, and, sometimes, higher, numerals, is, now, rarely, used, for, white, dwarf, or, hot, sub, dwarf, classes, since, the, temperature, letters, of, the, main, sequence, and, giant, stars, no, longer, apply, to, white, dwarfs, occasionally, letters, a, and, b, are, applied, to, luminosity, classes, other, than, supergiants, for, example, a, giant, star, slightly, less, luminous, than, typical, may, be, given, a, luminosity, class, of, iiib, while, a, luminosity, class, iiia, indicates, a, star, slightly, brighter, than, a, typical, giant, a, sample, of, extreme, v, stars, with, strong, absorption, in, he, ii, 4686, spectral, lines, have, been, given, the, vz, designation, an, example, star, is, hd, 93129, b, additional, nomenclature, in, the, form, of, lower, case, letters, can, follow, the, spectral, type, to, indicate, peculiar, features, of, the, spectrum, for, example, 59, cygni, is, listed, as, spectral, type, b1, 5vnne, indicating, a, spectrum, with, the, general, classification, b1, 5v, as, well, as, very, broad, absorption, lines, and, certain, emission, lines, the, reason, for, the, odd, arrangement, of, letters, in, the, harvard, classification, is, historical, having, evolved, from, the, earlier, secchi, classes, and, been, progressively, modified, as, understanding, improved, during, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, pioneering, stellar, spectroscopist, angelo, secchi, created, the, secchi, classes, in, order, to, classify, observed, spectra, by, 1866, he, had, developed, three, classes, of, stellar, spectra, shown, in, the, table, below, in, the, late, 1890s, this, classification, began, to, be, superseded, by, the, harvard, classification, which, is, discussed, in, the, remainder, of, this, article, the, roman, numerals, used, for, secchi, classes, should, not, be, confused, with, the, completely, unrelated, roman, numerals, used, for, yerkes, luminosity, classes, and, the, proposed, neutron, star, classes, in, the, 1880s, the, astronomer, edward, c, pickering, began, to, make, a, survey, of, stellar, spectra, at, the, harvard, college, observatory, using, the, objective, prism, method, a, first, result, of, this, work, was, the, draper, catalogue, of, stellar, spectra, published, in, 1890, williamina, fleming, classified, most, of, the, spectra, in, this, catalogue, and, was, credited, with, classifying, over, 10, 000, featured, stars, and, discovering, 10, novae, and, more, than, 200, variable, stars, with, the, help, of, the, harvard, computers, especially, williamina, fleming, the, first, iteration, of, the, henry, draper, catalogue, was, devised, to, replace, the, roman, numeral, scheme, established, by, angelo, secchi, the, catalogue, used, a, scheme, in, which, the, previously, used, secchi, classes, i, to, v, were, subdivided, into, more, specific, classes, given, letters, from, a, to, p, also, the, letter, q, was, used, for, stars, not, fitting, into, any, other, class, fleming, worked, with, pickering, to, differentiate, 17, different, classes, based, on, the, intensity, of, hydrogen, spectral, lines, which, causes, variation, in, the, wavelengths, emanated, from, stars, and, results, in, variation, in, color, appearance, the, spectra, in, class, a, tended, to, produce, the, strongest, hydrogen, absorption, lines, while, spectra, in, class, o, produced, virtually, no, visible, lines, the, lettering, system, displayed, the, gradual, decrease, in, hydrogen, absorption, in, the, spectral, classes, when, moving, down, the, alphabet, this, classification, system, was, later, modified, by, annie, jump, cannon, and, antonia, maury, to, produce, the, harvard, spectral, classification, scheme, in, 1897, another, astronomer, at, harvard, antonia, maury, placed, the, orion, subtype, of, secchi, class, i, ahead, of, the, remainder, of, secchi, class, i, thus, placing, the, modern, type, b, ahead, of, the, modern, type, a, she, was, the, first, to, do, so, although, she, did, not, use, lettered, spectral, types, but, rather, a, series, of, twenty, two, types, numbered, from, i, xxii, because, the, 22, roman, numeral, groupings, did, not, account, for, additional, variations, in, spectra, three, additional, divisions, were, made, to, further, specify, differences, lowercase, letters, were, added, to, differentiate, relative, line, appearance, in, spectra, the, lines, were, defined, as, antonia, maury, published, her, own, stellar, classification, catalogue, in, 1897, called, spectra, of, bright, stars, photographed, with, the, 11, inch, draper, telescope, as, part, of, the, henry, draper, memorial, which, included, 4, 800, photographs, and, maury, s, analyses, of, 681, bright, northern, stars, this, was, the, first, instance, in, which, a, woman, was, credited, for, an, observatory, publication, in, 1901, annie, jump, cannon, returned, to, the, lettered, types, but, dropped, all, letters, except, o, b, a, f, g, k, m, and, n, used, in, that, order, as, well, as, p, for, planetary, nebulae, and, q, for, some, peculiar, spectra, she, also, used, types, such, as, b5a, for, stars, halfway, between, types, b, and, a, f2g, for, stars, one, fifth, of, the, way, from, f, to, g, and, so, on, finally, by, 1912, cannon, had, changed, the, types, b, a, b5a, f2g, etc, to, b0, a0, b5, f2, etc, this, is, essentially, the, modern, form, of, the, harvard, classification, system, this, system, was, developed, through, the, analysis, of, spectra, on, photographic, plates, which, could, convert, light, emanated, from, stars, into, a, readable, spectrum, a, luminosity, classification, known, as, the, mount, wilson, system, was, used, to, distinguish, between, stars, of, different, luminosities, this, notation, system, is, still, sometimes, seen, on, modern, spectra, the, stellar, classification, system, is, taxonomic, based, on, type, specimens, similar, to, classification, of, species, in, biology, the, categories, are, defined, by, one, or, more, standard, stars, for, each, category, and, sub, category, with, an, associated, description, of, the, distinguishing, features, stars, are, often, referred, to, as, early, or, late, types, early, is, a, synonym, for, hotter, while, late, is, a, synonym, for, cooler, depending, on, the, context, early, and, late, may, be, absolute, or, relative, terms, early, as, an, absolute, term, would, therefore, refer, to, o, or, b, and, possibly, a, stars, as, a, relative, reference, it, relates, to, stars, hotter, than, others, such, as, early, k, being, perhaps, k0, k1, k2, and, k3, late, is, used, in, the, same, way, with, an, unqualified, use, of, the, term, indicating, stars, with, spectral, types, such, as, k, and, m, but, it, can, also, be, used, for, stars, that, are, cool, relative, to, other, stars, as, in, using, late, g, to, refer, to, g7, g8, and, g9, in, the, relative, sense, early, means, a, lower, arabic, numeral, following, the, class, letter, and, late, means, a, higher, number, this, obscure, terminology, is, a, hold, over, from, a, late, nineteenth, century, model, of, stellar, evolution, which, supposed, that, stars, were, powered, by, gravitational, contraction, via, the, kelvin, helmholtz, mechanism, which, is, now, known, to, not, apply, to, main, sequence, stars, if, that, were, true, then, stars, would, start, their, lives, as, very, hot, early, type, stars, and, then, gradually, cool, down, into, late, type, stars, this, mechanism, provided, ages, of, the, sun, that, were, much, smaller, than, what, is, observed, in, the, geologic, record, and, was, rendered, obsolete, by, the, discovery, that, stars, are, powered, by, nuclear, fusion, the, terms, early, and, late, were, carried, over, beyond, the, demise, of, the, model, they, were, based, on, o, type, stars, are, very, hot, and, extremely, luminous, with, most, of, their, radiated, output, in, the, ultraviolet, range, these, are, the, rarest, of, all, main, sequence, stars, about, 1, in, 3, 000, 000, 0, 00003, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, are, o, type, stars, some, of, the, most, massive, stars, lie, within, this, spectral, class, o, type, stars, frequently, have, complicated, surroundings, that, make, measurement, of, their, spectra, difficult, o, type, spectra, formerly, were, defined, by, the, ratio, of, the, strength, of, the, he, ii, 4541, relative, to, that, of, he, i, 4471, where, is, the, radiation, wavelength, spectral, type, o7, was, defined, to, be, the, point, at, which, the, two, intensities, are, equal, with, the, he, i, line, weakening, towards, earlier, types, type, o3, was, by, definition, the, point, at, which, said, line, disappears, altogether, although, it, can, be, seen, very, faintly, with, modern, technology, due, to, this, the, modern, definition, uses, the, ratio, of, the, nitrogen, line, n, iv, 4058, to, n, iii, 4634, 40, 42, o, type, stars, have, dominant, lines, of, absorption, and, sometimes, emission, for, he, ii, lines, prominent, ionized, si, iv, o, iii, n, iii, and, c, iii, and, neutral, helium, lines, strengthening, from, o5, to, o9, and, prominent, hydrogen, balmer, lines, although, not, as, strong, as, in, later, types, higher, mass, o, type, stars, do, not, retain, extensive, atmospheres, due, to, the, extreme, velocity, of, their, stellar, wind, which, may, reach, 2, 000, km, s, because, they, are, so, massive, o, type, stars, have, very, hot, cores, and, burn, through, their, hydrogen, fuel, very, quickly, so, they, are, the, first, stars, to, leave, the, main, sequence, when, the, mkk, classification, scheme, was, first, described, in, 1943, the, only, subtypes, of, class, o, used, were, o5, to, o9, 5, the, mkk, scheme, was, extended, to, o9, 7, in, 1971, and, o4, in, 1978, and, new, classification, schemes, that, add, types, o2, o3, and, o3, 5, have, subsequently, been, introduced, spectral, standards, b, type, stars, are, very, luminous, and, blue, their, spectra, have, neutral, helium, lines, which, are, most, prominent, at, the, b2, subclass, and, moderate, hydrogen, lines, as, o, and, b, type, stars, are, so, energetic, they, only, live, for, a, relatively, short, time, thus, due, to, the, low, probability, of, kinematic, interaction, during, their, lifetime, they, are, unable, to, stray, far, from, the, area, in, which, they, formed, apart, from, runaway, stars, the, transition, from, class, o, to, class, b, was, originally, defined, to, be, the, point, at, which, the, he, ii, 4541, disappears, however, with, modern, equipment, the, line, is, still, apparent, in, the, early, b, type, stars, today, for, main, sequence, stars, the, b, class, is, instead, defined, by, the, intensity, of, the, he, i, violet, spectrum, with, the, maximum, intensity, corresponding, to, class, b2, for, supergiants, lines, of, silicon, are, used, instead, the, si, iv, 4089, and, si, iii, 4552, lines, are, indicative, of, early, b, at, mid, b, the, intensity, of, the, latter, relative, to, that, of, si, ii, 4128, 30, is, the, defining, characteristic, while, for, late, b, it, is, the, intensity, of, mg, ii, 4481, relative, to, that, of, he, i, 4471, these, stars, tend, to, be, found, in, their, originating, ob, associations, which, are, associated, with, giant, molecular, clouds, the, orion, ob1, association, occupies, a, large, portion, of, a, spiral, arm, of, the, milky, way, and, contains, many, of, the, brighter, stars, of, the, constellation, orion, about, 1, in, 800, 0, 125, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, are, b, type, main, sequence, stars, b, type, stars, are, relatively, uncommon, and, the, closest, is, regulus, at, around, 80, light, years, massive, yet, non, supergiant, stars, known, as, be, stars, have, been, observed, to, show, one, or, more, balmer, lines, in, emission, with, the, hydrogen, related, electromagnetic, radiation, series, projected, out, by, the, stars, being, of, particular, interest, be, stars, are, generally, thought, to, feature, unusually, strong, stellar, winds, high, surface, temperatures, and, significant, attrition, of, stellar, mass, as, the, objects, rotate, at, a, curiously, rapid, rate, objects, known, as, b, stars, or, b, e, stars, for, typographic, reasons, possess, distinctive, neutral, or, low, ionisation, emission, lines, that, are, considered, to, have, forbidden, mechanisms, undergoing, processes, not, normally, allowed, under, current, understandings, of, quantum, mechanics, spectral, standards, a, type, stars, are, among, the, more, common, naked, eye, stars, and, are, white, or, bluish, white, they, have, strong, hydrogen, lines, at, a, maximum, by, a0, and, also, lines, of, ionized, metals, fe, ii, mg, ii, si, ii, at, a, maximum, at, a5, the, presence, of, ca, ii, lines, is, notably, strengthening, by, this, point, about, 1, in, 160, 0, 625, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, are, a, type, stars, which, includes, 9, stars, within, 15, parsecs, spectral, standards, f, type, stars, have, strengthening, spectral, lines, h, and, k, of, ca, ii, neutral, metals, fe, i, cr, i, beginning, to, gain, on, ionized, metal, lines, by, late, f, their, spectra, are, characterized, by, the, weaker, hydrogen, lines, and, ionized, metals, their, color, is, white, about, 1, in, 33, 3, 03, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, are, f, type, stars, including, 1, star, procyon, a, within, 20, ly, spectral, standards, g, type, stars, including, the, sun, have, prominent, spectral, lines, h, and, k, of, ca, ii, which, are, most, pronounced, at, g2, they, have, even, weaker, hydrogen, lines, than, f, but, along, with, the, ionized, metals, they, have, neutral, metals, there, is, a, prominent, spike, in, the, g, band, of, cn, molecules, class, g, main, sequence, stars, make, up, about, 7, 5, nearly, one, in, thirteen, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, there, are, 21, g, type, stars, within, 10pc, class, g, contains, the, yellow, evolutionary, void, supergiant, stars, often, swing, between, o, or, b, blue, and, k, or, m, red, while, they, do, this, they, do, not, stay, for, long, in, the, unstable, yellow, supergiant, class, spectral, standards, k, type, stars, are, orangish, stars, that, are, slightly, cooler, than, the, sun, they, make, up, about, 12, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, there, are, also, giant, k, type, stars, which, range, from, hypergiants, like, rw, cephei, to, giants, and, supergiants, such, as, arcturus, whereas, orange, dwarfs, like, alpha, centauri, b, are, main, sequence, stars, they, have, extremely, weak, hydrogen, lines, if, those, are, present, at, all, and, mostly, neutral, metals, mn, i, fe, i, si, i, by, late, k, molecular, bands, of, titanium, oxide, become, present, mainstream, theories, those, rooted, in, lower, harmful, radioactivity, and, star, longevity, would, thus, suggest, such, stars, have, the, optimal, chances, of, heavily, evolved, life, developing, on, orbiting, planets, if, such, life, is, directly, analogous, to, earth, s, due, to, a, broad, habitable, zone, yet, much, lower, harmful, periods, of, emission, compared, to, those, with, the, broadest, such, zones, spectral, standards, class, m, stars, are, by, far, the, most, common, about, 76, of, the, main, sequence, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, are, class, m, stars, however, class, m, main, sequence, stars, red, dwarfs, have, such, low, luminosities, that, none, are, bright, enough, to, be, seen, with, the, unaided, eye, unless, under, exceptional, conditions, the, brightest, known, m, class, main, sequence, star, is, lacaille, 8760, class, m0v, with, magnitude, 6, 7, the, limiting, magnitude, for, typical, naked, eye, visibility, under, good, conditions, being, typically, quoted, as, 6, 5, and, it, is, extremely, unlikely, that, any, brighter, examples, will, be, found, although, most, class, m, stars, are, red, dwarfs, most, of, the, largest, known, supergiant, stars, in, the, milky, way, are, class, m, stars, such, as, vy, canis, majoris, vv, cephei, antares, and, betelgeuse, furthermore, some, larger, hotter, brown, dwarfs, are, late, class, m, usually, in, the, range, of, m6, 5, to, m9, 5, the, spectrum, of, a, class, m, star, contains, lines, from, oxide, molecules, in, the, visible, spectrum, especially, tio, and, all, neutral, metals, but, absorption, lines, of, hydrogen, are, usually, absent, tio, bands, can, be, strong, in, class, m, stars, usually, dominating, their, visible, spectrum, by, about, m5, vanadium, ii, oxide, bands, become, present, by, late, m, spectral, standards, a, number, of, new, spectral, types, have, been, taken, into, use, from, newly, discovered, types, of, stars, spectra, of, some, very, hot, and, bluish, stars, exhibit, marked, emission, lines, from, carbon, or, nitrogen, or, sometimes, oxygen, once, included, as, type, o, stars, the, wolf, rayet, stars, of, class, w, or, wr, are, notable, for, spectra, lacking, hydrogen, lines, instead, their, spectra, are, dominated, by, broad, emission, lines, of, highly, ionized, helium, nitrogen, carbon, and, sometimes, oxygen, they, are, thought, to, mostly, be, dying, supergiants, with, their, hydrogen, layers, blown, away, by, stellar, winds, thereby, directly, exposing, their, hot, helium, shells, class, wr, is, further, divided, into, subclasses, according, to, the, relative, strength, of, nitrogen, and, carbon, emission, lines, in, their, spectra, and, outer, layers, wr, spectra, range, is, listed, below, although, the, central, stars, of, most, planetary, nebulae, cspne, show, o, type, spectra, around, 10, are, hydrogen, deficient, and, show, wr, spectra, these, are, low, mass, stars, and, to, distinguish, them, from, the, massive, wolf, rayet, stars, their, spectra, are, enclosed, in, square, brackets, e, g, most, of, these, show, spectra, some, and, very, rarely, the, slash, stars, are, o, type, stars, with, wn, like, lines, in, their, spectra, the, name, slash, comes, from, their, printed, spectral, type, having, a, slash, in, it, e, g, of, wnl, there, is, a, secondary, group, found, with, these, spectra, a, cooler, intermediate, group, designated, ofpe, wn9, these, stars, have, also, been, referred, to, as, wn10, or, wn11, but, that, has, become, less, popular, with, the, realisation, of, the, evolutionary, difference, from, other, wolf, rayet, stars, recent, discoveries, of, even, rarer, stars, have, extended, the, range, of, slash, stars, as, far, as, o2, 3, 5if, wn5, 7, which, are, even, hotter, than, the, original, slash, stars, they, are, o, stars, with, strong, magnetic, fields, designation, is, of, p, the, new, spectral, types, l, t, and, y, were, created, to, classify, infrared, spectra, of, cool, stars, this, includes, both, red, dwarfs, and, brown, dwarfs, that, are, very, faint, in, the, visible, spectrum, brown, dwarfs, stars, that, do, not, undergo, hydrogen, fusion, cool, as, they, age, and, so, progress, to, later, spectral, types, brown, dwarfs, start, their, lives, with, m, type, spectra, and, will, cool, through, the, l, t, and, y, spectral, classes, faster, the, less, massive, they, are, the, highest, mass, brown, dwarfs, cannot, have, cooled, to, y, or, even, t, dwarfs, within, the, age, of, the, universe, because, this, leads, to, an, unresolvable, overlap, between, spectral, types, effective, temperature, and, luminosity, for, some, masses, and, ages, of, different, l, t, y, types, no, distinct, temperature, or, luminosity, values, can, be, given, class, l, dwarfs, get, their, designation, because, they, are, cooler, than, m, stars, and, l, is, the, remaining, letter, alphabetically, closest, to, m, some, of, these, objects, have, masses, large, enough, to, support, hydrogen, fusion, and, are, therefore, stars, but, most, are, of, substellar, mass, and, are, therefore, brown, dwarfs, they, are, a, very, dark, red, in, color, and, brightest, in, infrared, their, atmosphere, is, cool, enough, to, allow, metal, hydrides, and, alkali, metals, to, be, prominent, in, their, spectra, due, to, low, surface, gravity, in, giant, stars, tio, and, vo, bearing, condensates, never, form, thus, l, type, stars, larger, than, dwarfs, can, never, form, in, an, isolated, environment, however, it, may, be, possible, for, these, l, type, supergiants, to, form, through, stellar, collisions, an, example, of, which, is, v838, monocerotis, while, in, the, height, of, its, luminous, red, nova, eruption, class, t, dwarfs, are, cool, brown, dwarfs, with, surface, temperatures, between, approximately, 550, and, 1, 300, k, 277, and, 1, 027, c, 530, and, 1, 880, f, their, emission, peaks, in, the, infrared, methane, is, prominent, in, their, spectra, study, of, the, number, of, proplyds, protoplanetary, disks, clumps, of, gas, in, nebulae, from, which, stars, and, planetary, systems, are, formed, indicates, that, the, number, of, stars, in, the, galaxy, should, be, several, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, what, was, previously, conjectured, it, is, theorized, that, these, proplyds, are, in, a, race, with, each, other, the, first, one, to, form, will, become, a, protostar, which, are, very, violent, objects, and, will, disrupt, other, proplyds, in, the, vicinity, stripping, them, of, their, gas, the, victim, proplyds, will, then, probably, go, on, to, become, main, sequence, stars, or, brown, dwarfs, of, the, l, and, t, classes, which, are, quite, invisible, to, us, brown, dwarfs, of, spectral, class, y, are, cooler, than, those, of, spectral, class, t, and, have, qualitatively, different, spectra, from, them, a, total, of, 17, objects, have, been, placed, in, class, y, as, of, august, 2013, although, such, dwarfs, have, been, modelled, and, detected, within, forty, light, years, by, the, wide, field, infrared, survey, explorer, wise, there, is, no, well, defined, spectral, sequence, yet, and, no, prototypes, nevertheless, several, objects, have, been, proposed, as, spectral, classes, y0, y1, and, y2, the, spectra, of, these, prospective, y, objects, display, absorption, around, 1, 55, micrometers, delorme, et, al, have, suggested, that, this, feature, is, due, to, absorption, from, ammonia, and, that, this, should, be, taken, as, the, indicative, feature, for, the, t, y, transition, in, fact, this, ammonia, absorption, feature, is, the, main, criterion, that, has, been, adopted, to, define, this, class, however, this, feature, is, difficult, to, distinguish, from, absorption, by, water, and, methane, and, other, authors, have, stated, that, the, assignment, of, class, y0, is, premature, the, latest, brown, dwarf, proposed, for, the, y, spectral, type, wise, 1828, 2650, is, a, y2, dwarf, with, an, effective, temperature, originally, estimated, around, 300, k, the, temperature, of, the, human, body, parallax, measurements, have, however, since, shown, that, its, luminosity, is, inconsistent, with, it, being, colder, than, 400, k, the, coolest, y, dwarf, currently, known, is, wise, 0855, 0714, with, an, approximate, temperature, of, 250, k, and, a, mass, just, seven, times, that, of, jupiter, the, mass, range, for, y, dwarfs, is, 9, 25, jupiter, masses, but, young, objects, might, reach, below, one, jupiter, mass, although, they, cool, to, become, planets, which, means, that, y, class, objects, straddle, the, 13, jupiter, mass, deuterium, fusion, limit, that, marks, the, current, iau, division, between, brown, dwarfs, and, planets, young, brown, dwarfs, have, low, surface, gravities, because, they, have, larger, radii, and, lower, masses, compared, to, the, field, stars, of, similar, spectral, type, these, sources, are, marked, by, a, letter, beta, for, intermediate, surface, gravity, and, gamma, for, low, surface, gravity, indication, for, low, surface, gravity, are, weak, cah, k, i, and, na, i, lines, as, well, as, strong, vo, line, alpha, stands, for, normal, surface, gravity, and, is, usually, dropped, sometimes, an, extremely, low, surface, gravity, is, denoted, by, a, delta, the, suffix, pec, stands, for, peculiar, the, peculiar, suffix, is, still, used, for, other, features, that, are, unusual, and, summarizes, different, properties, indicative, of, low, surface, gravity, subdwarfs, and, unresolved, binaries, the, prefix, sd, stands, for, subdwarf, and, only, includes, cool, subdwarfs, this, prefix, indicates, a, low, metallicity, and, kinematic, properties, that, are, more, similar, to, halo, stars, than, to, disk, stars, subdwarfs, appear, bluer, than, disk, objects, the, red, suffix, describes, objects, with, red, color, but, an, older, age, this, is, not, interpreted, as, low, surface, gravity, but, as, a, high, dust, content, the, blue, suffix, describes, objects, with, blue, near, infrared, colors, that, cannot, be, explained, with, low, metallicity, some, are, explained, as, l, t, binaries, others, are, not, binaries, such, as, 2mass, j11263991, 5003550, and, are, explained, with, thin, and, or, large, grained, clouds, carbon, stars, are, stars, whose, spectra, indicate, production, of, carbon, a, byproduct, of, triple, alpha, helium, fusion, with, increased, carbon, abundance, and, some, parallel, s, process, heavy, element, production, the, spectra, of, these, stars, become, increasingly, deviant, from, the, usual, late, spectral, classes, g, k, and, m, equivalent, classes, for, carbon, rich, stars, are, s, and, c, the, giants, among, those, stars, are, presumed, to, produce, this, carbon, themselves, but, some, stars, in, this, class, are, double, stars, whose, odd, atmosphere, is, suspected, of, having, been, transferred, from, a, companion, that, is, now, a, white, dwarf, when, the, companion, was, a, carbon, star, originally, classified, as, r, and, n, stars, these, are, also, known, as, carbon, stars, these, are, red, giants, near, the, end, of, their, lives, in, which, there, is, an, excess, of, carbon, in, the, atmosphere, the, old, r, and, n, classes, ran, parallel, to, the, normal, classification, system, from, roughly, mid, g, to, late, m, these, have, more, recently, been, remapped, into, a, unified, carbon, classifier, c, with, n0, starting, at, roughly, c6, another, subset, of, cool, carbon, stars, are, the, c, j, type, stars, which, are, characterized, by, the, strong, presence, of, molecules, of, 13, cn, in, addition, to, those, of, 12, cn, a, few, main, sequence, carbon, stars, are, known, but, the, overwhelming, majority, of, known, carbon, stars, are, giants, or, supergiants, there, are, several, subclasses, class, s, stars, form, a, continuum, between, class, m, stars, and, carbon, stars, those, most, similar, to, class, m, stars, have, strong, zro, absorption, bands, analogous, to, the, tio, bands, of, class, m, stars, whereas, those, most, similar, to, carbon, stars, have, strong, sodium, d, lines, and, weak, c, 2, bands, class, s, stars, have, excess, amounts, of, zirconium, and, other, elements, produced, by, the, s, process, and, have, more, similar, carbon, and, oxygen, abundances, to, class, m, or, carbon, stars, like, carbon, stars, nearly, all, known, class, s, stars, are, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, the, spectral, type, is, formed, by, the, letter, s, and, a, number, between, zero, and, ten, this, number, corresponds, to, the, temperature, of, the, star, and, approximately, follows, the, temperature, scale, used, for, class, m, giants, the, most, common, types, are, s3, to, s5, the, non, standard, designation, s10, has, only, been, used, for, the, star, chi, cygni, when, at, an, extreme, minimum, the, basic, classification, is, usually, followed, by, an, abundance, indication, following, one, of, several, schemes, s2, 5, s2, 5, s2, zr4, ti2, or, s2, 5, a, number, following, a, comma, is, a, scale, between, 1, and, 9, based, on, the, ratio, of, zro, and, tio, a, number, following, a, slash, is, a, more, recent, but, less, common, scheme, designed, to, represent, the, ratio, of, carbon, to, oxygen, on, a, scale, of, 1, to, 10, where, a, 0, would, be, an, ms, star, intensities, of, zirconium, and, titanium, may, be, indicated, explicitly, also, occasionally, seen, is, a, number, following, an, asterisk, which, represents, the, strength, of, the, zro, bands, on, a, scale, from, 1, to, 5, in, between, the, m, and, s, classes, border, cases, are, named, ms, stars, in, a, similar, way, border, cases, between, the, s, and, c, n, classes, are, named, sc, or, cs, the, sequence, m, ms, s, sc, c, n, is, hypothesized, to, be, a, sequence, of, increased, carbon, abundance, with, age, for, carbon, stars, in, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, the, class, d, for, degenerate, is, the, modern, classification, used, for, white, dwarfs, low, mass, stars, that, are, no, longer, undergoing, nuclear, fusion, and, have, shrunk, to, planetary, size, slowly, cooling, down, class, d, is, further, divided, into, spectral, types, da, db, dc, do, dq, dx, and, dz, the, letters, are, not, related, to, the, letters, used, in, the, classification, of, other, stars, but, instead, indicate, the, composition, of, the, white, dwarf, s, visible, outer, layer, or, atmosphere, the, white, dwarf, types, are, as, follows, the, type, is, followed, by, a, number, giving, the, white, dwarf, s, surface, temperature, this, number, is, a, rounded, form, of, 50400, t, eff, where, t, eff, is, the, effective, surface, temperature, measured, in, kelvins, originally, this, number, was, rounded, to, one, of, the, digits, 1, through, 9, but, more, recently, fractional, values, have, started, to, be, used, as, well, as, values, below, 1, and, above, 9, for, example, da1, 5, for, ik, pegasi, b, two, or, more, of, the, type, letters, may, be, used, to, indicate, a, white, dwarf, that, displays, more, than, one, of, the, spectral, features, above, a, different, set, of, spectral, peculiarity, symbols, are, used, for, white, dwarfs, than, for, other, types, of, stars, finally, the, classes, p, and, q, are, left, over, from, the, system, developed, by, cannon, for, the, henry, draper, catalogue, they, are, occasionally, used, for, certain, non, stellar, objects, type, p, objects, are, stars, within, planetary, nebulae, typically, young, white, dwarfs, or, hydrogen, poor, m, giants, type, q, objects, are, novae, stellar, remnants, are, objects, associated, with, the, death, of, stars, included, in, the, category, are, white, dwarfs, and, as, can, be, seen, from, the, radically, different, classification, scheme, for, class, d, non, stellar, objects, are, difficult, to, fit, into, the, mk, system, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, which, the, mk, system, is, based, on, is, observational, in, nature, so, these, remnants, cannot, easily, be, plotted, on, the, diagram, or, cannot, be, placed, at, all, old, neutron, stars, are, relatively, small, and, cold, and, would, fall, on, the, far, right, side, of, the, diagram, planetary, nebulae, are, dynamic, and, tend, to, quickly, fade, in, brightness, as, the, progenitor, star, transitions, to, the, white, dwarf, branch, if, shown, a, planetary, nebula, would, be, plotted, to, the, right, of, the, diagram, s, upper, right, quadrant, a, black, hole, emits, no, visible, light, of, its, own, and, therefore, would, not, appear, on, the, diagram, a, classification, system, for, neutron, stars, using, roman, numerals, has, been, proposed, type, i, for, less, massive, neutron, stars, with, low, cooling, rates, type, ii, for, more, massive, neutron, stars, with, higher, cooling, rates, and, a, proposed, type, iii, for, more, massive, neutron, stars, possible, exotic, star, candidates, with, higher, cooling, rates, the, more, massive, a, neutron, star, is, the, higher, neutrino, flux, it, carries, these, neutrinos, carry, away, so, much, heat, energy, that, after, only, a, few, years, the, temperature, of, an, isolated, neutron, star, falls, from, the, order, of, billions, to, only, around, a, million, kelvin, this, proposed, neutron, star, classification, system, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, earlier, secchi, spectral, classes, and, the, yerkes, luminosity, classes, several, spectral, types, all, previously, used, for, non, standard, stars, in, the, mid, 20th, century, have, been, replaced, during, revisions, of, the, stellar, classification, system, they, may, still, be, found, in, old, editions, of, star, catalogs, r, and, n, have, been, subsumed, into, the, new, c, class, as, c, r, and, c, n, while, humans, may, eventually, be, able, to, colonize, any, kind, of, stellar, habitat, this, section, will, address, the, probability, of, life, arising, around, other, stars, stability, luminosity, and, lifespan, are, all, factors, in, stellar, habitability, humans, know, of, only, one, star, that, hosts, life, the, g, class, sun, a, star, with, an, abundance, of, heavy, elements, and, low, variability, in, brightness, the, solar, system, is, also, unlike, many, stellar, systems, in, that, it, only, contains, one, star, see, habitability, of, binary, star, systems, working, from, these, constraints, and, the, problems, of, having, an, empirical, sample, set, of, only, one, the, range, of, stars, that, are, predicted, to, be, able, to, support, life, is, limited, by, a, few, factors, of, the, main, sequence, star, types, stars, more, massive, than, 1, 5, times, that, of, the, sun, spectral, types, o, b, and, a, age, too, quickly, for, advanced, life, to, develop, using, earth, as, a, guideline, on, the, other, extreme, dwarfs, of, less, than, half, the, mass, of, the, sun, spectral, type, m, are, likely, to, tidally, lock, planets, within, their, habitable, zone, along, with, other, problems, see, habitability, of, red, dwarf, systems, while, there, are, many, problems, facing, life, on, red, dwarfs, many, astronomers, continue, to, model, these, systems, due, to, their, sheer, numbers, and, longevity, for, these, reasons, nasa, s, kepler, mission, is, searching, for, habitable, planets, at, nearby, main, sequence, stars, that, are, less, massive, than, spectral, type, a, but, more, massive, than, type, m, making, the, most, probable, stars, to, host, life, dwarf, stars, of, types, f, g, and, k
