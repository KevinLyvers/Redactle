the, hyades, h, a, d, i, z, greek, also, known, as, caldwell, 41, collinder, 50, or, melotte, 25, is, the, nearest, open, cluster, and, one, of, the, best, studied, star, clusters, located, about, 153, light, years, 47, parsecs, away, from, the, sun, it, consists, of, a, roughly, spherical, group, of, hundreds, of, stars, sharing, the, same, age, place, of, origin, chemical, characteristics, and, motion, through, space, from, the, perspective, of, observers, on, earth, the, hyades, cluster, appears, in, the, constellation, taurus, where, its, brightest, stars, form, a, v, shape, along, with, the, still, brighter, aldebaran, however, aldebaran, is, unrelated, to, the, hyades, as, it, is, located, much, closer, to, earth, 65, ly, and, merely, happens, to, lie, along, the, same, line, of, sight, the, five, brightest, member, stars, of, the, hyades, have, consumed, the, hydrogen, fuel, at, their, cores, and, are, now, evolving, into, giant, stars, four, of, these, stars, with, bayer, designations, gamma, delta, 1, epsilon, and, theta, tauri, form, an, asterism, that, is, traditionally, identified, as, the, head, of, taurus, the, bull, the, fifth, of, these, stars, is, theta, 1, tauri, a, tight, naked, eye, companion, to, the, brighter, theta, 2, tauri, epsilon, tauri, known, as, ain, the, bull, s, eye, has, a, gas, giant, exoplanet, candidate, the, first, planet, to, be, found, in, any, open, cluster, the, age, of, the, hyades, is, estimated, to, be, about, 625, million, years, the, core, of, the, cluster, where, stars, are, the, most, densely, packed, has, a, radius, of, 8, 8, light, years, 2, 7, parsecs, and, the, cluster, s, tidal, radius, where, the, stars, become, more, strongly, influenced, by, the, gravity, of, the, surrounding, milky, way, galaxy, is, 33, light, years, 10, parsecs, however, about, one, third, of, confirmed, member, stars, have, been, observed, well, outside, the, latter, boundary, in, the, cluster, s, extended, halo, these, stars, are, probably, in, the, process, of, escaping, from, its, gravitational, influence, the, cluster, is, sufficiently, close, to, the, sun, that, its, distance, can, be, directly, measured, by, observing, the, amount, of, parallax, shift, of, the, member, stars, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, this, measurement, has, been, performed, with, great, accuracy, using, the, hipparcos, satellite, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, an, alternative, method, of, computing, the, distance, is, to, fit, the, cluster, members, to, a, standardized, infrared, color, magnitude, diagram, for, stars, of, their, type, and, use, the, resulting, data, to, infer, their, intrinsic, brightness, comparing, this, data, to, the, brightness, of, the, stars, as, seen, from, earth, allows, their, distances, to, be, estimated, both, methods, have, yielded, a, distance, estimate, of, 153, light, years, 47, parsecs, to, the, cluster, center, the, fact, that, these, independent, measurements, agree, makes, the, hyades, an, important, rung, on, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, method, for, estimating, the, distances, of, extragalactic, objects, the, stars, of, the, hyades, are, more, enriched, in, heavier, elements, than, the, sun, and, other, ordinary, stars, in, the, solar, neighborhood, with, the, overall, cluster, metallicity, measured, at, 0, 14, the, hyades, cluster, is, related, to, other, stellar, groups, in, the, sun, s, vicinity, its, age, metallicity, and, proper, motion, coincide, with, those, of, the, larger, and, more, distant, praesepe, cluster, and, the, trajectories, of, both, clusters, can, be, traced, back, to, the, same, region, of, space, indicating, a, common, origin, another, associate, is, the, hyades, stream, a, large, collection, of, scattered, stars, that, also, share, a, similar, trajectory, with, the, hyades, cluster, recent, results, have, found, that, at, least, 15, of, stars, in, the, hyades, stream, share, the, same, chemical, fingerprint, as, the, hyades, cluster, stars, however, about, 85, of, stars, in, the, hyades, stream, have, been, shown, to, be, completely, unrelated, to, the, original, cluster, on, the, grounds, of, dissimilar, age, and, metallicity, their, common, motion, is, attributed, to, tidal, effects, of, the, massive, rotating, bar, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, among, the, remaining, members, of, the, hyades, stream, the, exoplanet, host, star, iota, horologii, has, recently, been, proposed, as, an, escaped, member, of, the, primordial, hyades, cluster, the, hyades, are, unrelated, to, two, other, nearby, stellar, groups, the, pleiades, and, the, ursa, major, stream, which, are, easily, visible, to, the, naked, eye, under, clear, dark, skies, a, 2018, gaia, dr1, study, of, the, hyades, cluster, determined, a, u, v, w, group, velocity, of, 41, 92, 0, 16, 19, 35, 0, 13, 1, 11, 0, 11, km, sec, based, on, the, space, velocities, of, the, 138, core, stars, a, 2019, gaia, dr2, study, finds, a, u, v, w, group, velocity, of, 42, 24, 19, 00, 1, 48, km, sec, in, very, close, agreement, with, the, 2018, dr1, derivation, another, dr2, study, from, 2019, focused, on, mapping, the, 3d, topology, velocities, of, the, hyades, main, body, out, to, 30, parsecs, and, included, sub, stellar, members, as, well, they, identified, 1764, member, candidates, including, 10, brown, dwarfs, and, 17, white, dwarfs, the, white, dwarfs, included, 9, single, stars, and, 4, binary, systems, a, 2022, hyades, study, utilizing, gaia, edr3, derived, a, u, v, w, group, velocity, of, 42, 11, 6, 50, 19, 09, 4, 37, 1, 32, 0, 44, km, sec, also, with, close, agreement, to, dr1, and, dr2, studies, together, with, the, other, eye, catching, open, star, cluster, of, the, pleiades, the, hyades, form, the, golden, gate, of, the, ecliptic, which, has, been, known, for, several, thousand, years, in, greek, mythology, the, hyades, were, the, five, daughters, of, atlas, and, half, sisters, to, the, pleiades, after, the, death, of, their, brother, hyas, the, weeping, sisters, were, transformed, into, a, cluster, of, stars, that, was, afterwards, associated, with, rain, as, a, naked, eye, object, the, hyades, cluster, has, been, known, since, prehistoric, times, it, is, mentioned, by, numerous, classical, authors, from, homer, to, ovid, in, book, 18, of, the, iliad, the, stars, of, the, hyades, appear, along, with, the, pleiades, ursa, major, and, orion, on, the, shield, that, the, god, hephaistos, made, for, achilles, in, england, the, cluster, was, known, as, the, april, rainers, from, an, association, with, april, showers, as, recorded, in, the, folk, song, green, grow, the, rushes, o, the, cluster, was, probably, first, catalogued, by, giovanni, battista, hodierna, in, 1654, and, it, subsequently, appeared, in, many, star, atlases, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, however, charles, messier, did, not, include, the, hyades, in, his, 1781, catalog, of, deep, sky, objects, it, therefore, lacks, a, messier, number, unlike, many, other, more, distant, open, clusters, e, g, m44, praesepe, m45, pleiades, and, m67, in, 1869, the, astronomer, r, a, proctor, observed, that, numerous, stars, at, large, distances, from, the, hyades, share, a, similar, motion, through, space, in, 1908, lewis, boss, reported, almost, 25, years, of, observations, to, support, this, premise, arguing, for, the, existence, of, a, co, moving, group, of, stars, that, he, called, the, taurus, stream, now, generally, known, as, the, hyades, stream, or, hyades, supercluster, boss, published, a, chart, that, traced, the, scattered, stars, movements, back, to, a, common, point, of, convergence, by, the, 1920s, the, notion, that, the, hyades, shared, a, common, origin, with, the, praesepe, cluster, was, widespread, with, rudolf, klein, wassink, noting, in, 1927, that, the, two, clusters, are, probably, cosmically, related, for, much, of, the, twentieth, century, scientific, study, of, the, hyades, focused, on, determining, its, distance, modeling, its, evolution, confirming, or, rejecting, candidate, members, and, characterizing, individual, stars, all, stars, form, in, clusters, but, most, clusters, break, up, less, than, 50, million, years, after, star, formation, concludes, the, astronomical, term, for, this, process, is, evaporation, only, extremely, massive, clusters, orbiting, far, from, the, galactic, center, can, avoid, evaporation, over, extended, timescales, as, one, such, survivor, the, hyades, cluster, probably, contained, a, much, larger, star, population, in, its, infancy, estimates, of, its, original, mass, range, from, 800, to, 1, 600, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, m, implying, still, larger, numbers, of, individual, stars, theory, predicts, that, a, young, cluster, of, this, size, should, give, birth, to, stars, and, substellar, objects, of, all, spectral, types, from, huge, hot, o, stars, down, to, dim, brown, dwarfs, however, studies, of, the, hyades, show, that, it, is, deficient, in, stars, at, both, extremes, of, mass, at, an, age, of, 625, million, years, the, cluster, s, main, sequence, turn, off, is, about, 2, 3, m, meaning, that, all, heavier, stars, have, evolved, into, subgiants, giants, or, white, dwarfs, while, less, massive, stars, continue, fusing, hydrogen, on, the, main, sequence, extensive, surveys, have, revealed, a, total, of, 8, white, dwarfs, in, the, cluster, core, corresponding, to, the, final, evolutionary, stage, of, its, original, population, of, b, type, stars, each, about, 3, m, the, preceding, evolutionary, stage, is, currently, represented, by, the, cluster, s, four, red, clump, giants, their, present, spectral, type, is, k0, iii, but, all, are, actually, retired, a, stars, of, around, 2, 5, m, an, additional, white, giant, of, type, a7, iii, is, the, primary, of, 2, tauri, a, binary, system, that, includes, a, less, massive, companion, of, spectral, type, a, this, pair, is, visually, associated, with, 1, tauri, one, of, the, four, red, giants, which, also, has, an, a, type, binary, companion, the, remaining, population, of, confirmed, cluster, members, includes, numerous, bright, stars, of, spectral, types, a, at, least, 21, f, about, 60, and, g, about, 50, all, these, star, types, are, concentrated, much, more, densely, within, the, tidal, radius, of, the, hyades, than, within, an, equivalent, 10, parsec, radius, of, the, earth, by, comparison, our, local, 10, parsec, sphere, contains, only, 4, a, stars, 6, f, stars, and, 21, g, stars, the, hyades, cohort, of, lower, mass, stars, spectral, types, k, and, m, remains, poorly, understood, despite, proximity, and, long, observation, at, least, 48, k, dwarfs, are, confirmed, members, along, with, about, a, dozen, m, dwarfs, of, spectral, types, m0, m2, additional, m, dwarfs, have, been, proposed, in, the, past, this, deficiency, at, the, bottom, of, the, mass, range, contrasts, strongly, with, the, distribution, of, stars, within, 10, parsecs, of, the, solar, system, where, at, least, 239, m, dwarfs, are, known, comprising, about, 76, of, all, neighborhood, stars, in, more, recent, studies, more, low, mass, members, were, discovered, this, is, due, targeted, searches, and, an, improvement, in, proper, motion, searches, about, 35, l, type, 7, 1, 8, 6, 3, 4, 3, 3, and, 15, t, type, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 4, brown, dwarfs, are, currently, reported, as, hyades, members, or, candidate, members, meanwhile, gaia, dr2, allowed, the, identification, of, 710, cluster, members, within, 30, parsec, including, 23, candidates, with, estimated, masses, between, 60, and, 80, m, j, the, observed, distribution, of, stellar, types, in, the, hyades, cluster, demonstrates, a, history, of, mass, segregation, with, the, exception, of, its, white, dwarfs, the, cluster, s, central, two, parsecs, 6, 5, light, years, contain, only, star, systems, of, at, least, 1, m, this, tight, concentration, of, heavy, stars, gives, the, hyades, its, overall, structure, with, a, core, defined, by, bright, closely, packed, systems, and, a, halo, consisting, of, more, widely, separated, stars, in, which, later, spectral, types, are, common, the, core, radius, is, 2, 7, parsecs, 8, 8, light, years, a, little, more, than, the, distance, between, the, sun, and, sirius, while, the, half, mass, radius, within, which, half, the, cluster, s, mass, is, contained, is, 5, 7, parsecs, 19, light, years, the, tidal, radius, of, ten, parsecs, 33, light, years, represents, the, hyades, average, outer, limit, beyond, which, a, star, is, unlikely, to, remain, gravitationally, bound, to, the, cluster, core, stellar, evaporation, occurs, in, the, cluster, halo, as, smaller, stars, are, scattered, outward, by, more, massive, insiders, from, the, halo, they, may, then, be, lost, to, tides, exerted, by, the, galactic, core, or, to, shocks, generated, by, collisions, with, drifting, hydrogen, clouds, in, this, way, the, hyades, probably, lost, much, of, its, original, population, of, m, dwarfs, along, with, substantial, numbers, of, brighter, stars, another, result, of, mass, segregation, is, the, concentration, of, binary, systems, in, the, cluster, core, more, than, half, of, the, known, f, and, g, stars, are, binaries, and, these, are, preferentially, located, within, this, central, region, as, in, the, immediate, solar, neighborhood, binarity, increases, with, increasing, stellar, mass, the, fraction, of, binary, systems, in, the, hyades, increases, from, 26, among, k, type, stars, to, 87, among, a, type, stars, hyades, binaries, tend, to, have, small, separations, with, most, binary, pairs, in, shared, orbits, whose, semimajor, axes, are, smaller, than, 50, astronomical, units, although, the, exact, ratio, of, single, to, multiple, systems, in, the, cluster, remains, uncertain, this, ratio, has, considerable, implications, for, our, understanding, of, its, population, for, example, perryman, and, colleagues, list, about, 200, high, probability, hyades, members, if, the, binary, fraction, is, 50, the, total, cluster, population, would, be, at, least, 300, individual, stars, surveys, indicate, that, 90, of, open, clusters, dissolve, less, than, 1, billion, years, after, formation, while, only, a, tiny, fraction, survive, for, the, present, age, of, the, solar, system, about, 4, 6, billion, years, over, the, next, few, hundred, million, years, the, hyades, will, continue, to, lose, both, mass, and, membership, as, its, brightest, stars, evolve, off, the, main, sequence, and, its, dimmest, stars, evaporate, out, of, the, cluster, halo, it, may, eventually, be, reduced, to, a, remnant, containing, about, a, dozen, star, systems, most, of, them, binary, or, multiple, which, will, remain, vulnerable, to, ongoing, dissipative, forces, this, is, a, list, of, hyades, cluster, member, stars, that, are, fourth, magnitude, or, brighter, four, stars, in, the, hyades, have, been, found, to, host, exoplanets, epsilon, tauri, has, a, superjovian, planet, which, was, the, first, planet, to, be, discovered, in, any, open, cluster, hd, 285507, has, a, hot, jupiter, k2, 25, has, a, neptune, sized, planet, and, k2, 136, has, a, system, of, three, planets, another, star, hd, 283869, may, also, host, a, planet, but, this, has, not, been, confirmed, as, only, one, transit, has, been, detected, in, the, works, of, robert, w, chambers, h, p, lovecraft, and, others, the, fictional, city, of, carcosa, is, located, on, a, planet, in, the, hyades, a, 2018, archaeoastronomical, paper, suggested, that, the, hyades, may, have, inspired, the, norse, myth, of, ragnar, k, astronomer, donald, olson, questioned, these, findings, pointing, out, minor, errors,
