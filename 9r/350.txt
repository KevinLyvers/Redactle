a, carbon, nanotube, cnt, is, a, tube, made, of, carbon, with, a, diameter, in, the, nanometre, range, nanoscale, they, are, one, of, the, allotropes, of, carbon, two, broad, classes, of, carbon, nanotubes, are, recognized, carbon, nanotubes, can, exhibit, remarkable, properties, such, as, exceptional, tensile, strength, and, thermal, conductivity, because, of, their, nanostructure, and, strength, of, the, bonds, between, carbon, atoms, some, swcnt, structures, exhibit, high, electrical, conductivity, while, others, are, semiconductors, in, addition, carbon, nanotubes, can, be, chemically, modified, these, properties, are, expected, to, be, valuable, in, many, areas, of, technology, such, as, electronics, optics, composite, materials, replacing, or, complementing, carbon, fibres, nanotechnology, including, nanomedicine, and, other, applications, of, materials, science, the, predicted, properties, for, swcnts, were, tantalising, but, a, path, to, synthesising, them, was, lacking, until, 1993, when, iijima, and, ichihashi, at, nec, and, bethune, and, others, at, ibm, independently, discovered, that, co, vaporising, carbon, and, transition, metals, such, as, iron, and, cobalt, could, specifically, catalyse, swcnt, formation, these, discoveries, triggered, research, that, succeeded, in, greatly, increasing, the, efficiency, of, the, catalytic, production, technique, and, led, to, an, explosion, of, work, to, characterise, and, find, applications, for, swcnts, the, structure, of, an, ideal, infinitely, long, single, walled, carbon, nanotube, is, that, of, a, regular, hexagonal, lattice, drawn, on, an, infinite, cylindrical, surface, whose, vertices, are, the, positions, of, the, carbon, atoms, since, the, length, of, the, carbon, carbon, bonds, is, fairly, fixed, there, are, constraints, on, the, diameter, of, the, cylinder, and, the, arrangement, of, the, atoms, on, it, in, the, study, of, nanotubes, one, defines, a, zigzag, path, on, a, graphene, like, lattice, as, a, path, that, turns, 60, degrees, alternating, left, and, right, after, stepping, through, each, bond, it, is, also, conventional, to, define, an, armchair, path, as, one, that, makes, two, left, turns, of, 60, degrees, followed, by, two, right, turns, every, four, steps, on, some, carbon, nanotubes, there, is, a, closed, zigzag, path, that, goes, around, the, tube, one, says, that, the, tube, is, of, the, zigzag, type, or, configuration, or, simply, is, a, zigzag, nanotube, if, the, tube, is, instead, encircled, by, a, closed, armchair, path, it, is, said, to, be, of, the, armchair, type, or, an, armchair, nanotube, an, infinite, nanotube, that, is, of, one, type, consists, entirely, of, closed, paths, of, that, type, connected, to, each, other, the, zigzag, and, armchair, configurations, are, not, the, only, structures, that, a, single, walled, nanotube, can, have, to, describe, the, structure, of, a, general, infinitely, long, tube, one, should, imagine, it, being, sliced, open, by, a, cut, parallel, to, its, axis, that, goes, through, some, atom, a, and, then, unrolled, flat, on, the, plane, so, that, its, atoms, and, bonds, coincide, with, those, of, an, imaginary, graphene, sheet, more, precisely, with, an, infinitely, long, strip, of, that, sheet, the, two, halves, of, the, atom, a, will, end, up, on, opposite, edges, of, the, strip, over, two, atoms, a1, and, a2, of, the, graphene, the, line, from, a1, to, a2, will, correspond, to, the, circumference, of, the, cylinder, that, went, through, the, atom, a, and, will, be, perpendicular, to, the, edges, of, the, strip, in, the, graphene, lattice, the, atoms, can, be, split, into, two, classes, depending, on, the, directions, of, their, three, bonds, half, the, atoms, have, their, three, bonds, directed, the, same, way, and, half, have, their, three, bonds, rotated, 180, degrees, relative, to, the, first, half, the, atoms, a1, and, a2, which, correspond, to, the, same, atom, a, on, the, cylinder, must, be, in, the, same, class, it, follows, that, the, circumference, of, the, tube, and, the, angle, of, the, strip, are, not, arbitrary, because, they, are, constrained, to, the, lengths, and, directions, of, the, lines, that, connect, pairs, of, graphene, atoms, in, the, same, class, let, u, and, v, be, two, linearly, independent, vectors, that, connect, the, graphene, atom, a1, to, two, of, its, nearest, atoms, with, the, same, bond, directions, that, is, if, one, numbers, consecutive, carbons, around, a, graphene, cell, with, c1, to, c6, then, u, can, be, the, vector, from, c1, to, c3, and, v, be, the, vector, from, c1, to, c5, then, for, any, other, atom, a2, with, same, class, as, a1, the, vector, from, a1, to, a2, can, be, written, as, a, linear, combination, n, u, m, v, where, n, and, m, are, integers, and, conversely, each, pair, of, integers, n, m, defines, a, possible, position, for, a2, given, n, and, m, one, can, reverse, this, theoretical, operation, by, drawing, the, vector, w, on, the, graphene, lattice, cutting, a, strip, of, the, latter, along, lines, perpendicular, to, w, through, its, endpoints, a1, and, a2, and, rolling, the, strip, into, a, cylinder, so, as, to, bring, those, two, points, together, if, this, construction, is, applied, to, a, pair, k, 0, the, result, is, a, zigzag, nanotube, with, closed, zigzag, paths, of, 2, k, atoms, if, it, is, applied, to, a, pair, k, k, one, obtains, an, armchair, tube, with, closed, armchair, paths, of, 4, k, atoms, the, structure, of, the, nanotube, is, not, changed, if, the, strip, is, rotated, by, 60, degrees, clockwise, around, a1, before, applying, the, hypothetical, reconstruction, above, such, a, rotation, changes, the, corresponding, pair, n, m, to, the, pair, 2, m, n, m, it, follows, that, many, possible, positions, of, a2, relative, to, a1, that, is, many, pairs, n, m, correspond, to, the, same, arrangement, of, atoms, on, the, nanotube, that, is, the, case, for, example, of, the, six, pairs, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and, 3, 1, in, particular, the, pairs, k, 0, and, 0, k, describe, the, same, nanotube, geometry, these, redundancies, can, be, avoided, by, considering, only, pairs, n, m, such, that, n, 0, and, m, 0, that, is, where, the, direction, of, the, vector, w, lies, between, those, of, u, inclusive, and, v, exclusive, it, can, be, verified, that, every, nanotube, has, exactly, one, pair, n, m, that, satisfies, those, conditions, which, is, called, the, tube, s, type, conversely, for, every, type, there, is, a, hypothetical, nanotube, in, fact, two, nanotubes, have, the, same, type, if, and, only, if, one, can, be, conceptually, rotated, and, translated, so, as, to, match, the, other, exactly, instead, of, the, type, n, m, the, structure, of, a, carbon, nanotube, can, be, specified, by, giving, the, length, of, the, vector, w, that, is, the, circumference, of, the, nanotube, and, the, angle, between, the, directions, of, u, and, w, may, range, from, 0, inclusive, to, 60, degrees, clockwise, exclusive, if, the, diagram, is, drawn, with, u, horizontal, the, latter, is, the, tilt, of, the, strip, away, from, the, vertical, a, nanotube, is, chiral, if, it, has, type, n, m, with, m, 0, and, m, n, then, its, enantiomer, mirror, image, has, type, m, n, which, is, different, from, n, m, this, operation, corresponds, to, mirroring, the, unrolled, strip, about, the, line, l, through, a1, that, makes, an, angle, of, 30, degrees, clockwise, from, the, direction, of, the, u, vector, that, is, with, the, direction, of, the, vector, u, v, the, only, types, of, nanotubes, that, are, achiral, are, the, k, 0, zigzag, tubes, and, the, k, k, armchair, tubes, if, two, enantiomers, are, to, be, considered, the, same, structure, then, one, may, consider, only, types, n, m, with, 0, m, n, and, n, 0, then, the, angle, between, u, and, w, which, may, range, from, 0, to, 30, degrees, inclusive, both, is, called, the, chiral, angle, of, the, nanotube, from, n, and, m, one, can, also, compute, the, circumference, c, which, is, the, length, of, the, vector, w, which, turns, out, to, be, in, picometres, the, diameter, d, displaystyle, d, of, the, tube, is, then, c, displaystyle, c, pi, that, is, also, in, picometres, these, formulas, are, only, approximate, especially, for, small, n, and, m, where, the, bonds, are, strained, and, they, do, not, take, into, account, the, thickness, of, the, wall, the, tilt, angle, between, u, and, w, and, the, circumference, c, are, related, to, the, type, indices, n, and, m, by, where, arg, x, y, is, the, clockwise, angle, between, the, x, axis, and, the, vector, x, y, a, function, that, is, available, in, many, programming, languages, as, atan2, y, x, conversely, given, c, and, one, can, get, the, type, n, m, by, the, formulas, which, must, evaluate, to, integers, if, n, and, m, are, too, small, the, structure, described, by, the, pair, n, m, will, describe, a, molecule, that, cannot, be, reasonably, called, a, tube, and, may, not, even, be, stable, for, example, the, structure, theoretically, described, by, the, pair, 1, 0, the, limiting, zigzag, type, would, be, just, a, chain, of, carbons, that, is, a, real, molecule, the, carbyne, which, has, some, characteristics, of, nanotubes, such, as, orbital, hybridization, high, tensile, strength, etc, but, has, no, hollow, space, and, may, not, be, obtainable, as, a, condensed, phase, the, pair, 2, 0, would, theoretically, yield, a, chain, of, fused, 4, cycles, and, 1, 1, the, limiting, armchair, structure, would, yield, a, chain, of, bi, connected, 4, rings, these, structures, may, not, be, realizable, the, thinnest, carbon, nanotube, proper, is, the, armchair, structure, with, type, 2, 2, which, has, a, diameter, of, 0, 3, nm, this, nanotube, was, grown, inside, a, multi, walled, carbon, nanotube, assigning, of, the, carbon, nanotube, type, was, done, by, a, combination, of, high, resolution, transmission, electron, microscopy, hrtem, raman, spectroscopy, and, density, functional, theory, dft, calculations, the, thinnest, freestanding, single, walled, carbon, nanotube, is, about, 0, 43, nm, in, diameter, researchers, suggested, that, it, can, be, either, 5, 1, or, 4, 2, swcnt, but, the, exact, type, of, the, carbon, nanotube, remains, questionable, 3, 3, 4, 3, and, 5, 1, carbon, nanotubes, all, about, 0, 4, nm, in, diameter, were, unambiguously, identified, using, aberration, corrected, high, resolution, transmission, electron, microscopy, inside, double, walled, cnts, the, observation, of, the, longest, carbon, nanotubes, grown, so, far, around, 0, 5, metre, 550, mm, long, was, reported, in, 2013, these, nanotubes, were, grown, on, silicon, substrates, using, an, improved, chemical, vapor, deposition, cvd, method, and, represent, electrically, uniform, arrays, of, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, the, shortest, carbon, nanotube, can, be, considered, to, be, the, organic, compound, cycloparaphenylene, which, was, synthesized, in, 2008, by, ramesh, jasti, other, small, molecule, carbon, nanotubes, have, been, synthesized, since, the, highest, density, of, cnts, was, achieved, in, 2013, grown, on, a, conductive, titanium, coated, copper, surface, that, was, coated, with, co, catalysts, cobalt, and, molybdenum, at, lower, than, typical, temperatures, of, 450, c, the, tubes, averaged, a, height, of, 380, nm, and, a, mass, density, of, 1, 6, g, cm, 3, the, material, showed, ohmic, conductivity, lowest, resistance, 22, k, there, is, no, consensus, on, some, terms, describing, carbon, nanotubes, in, the, scientific, literature, both, wall, and, walled, are, being, used, in, combination, with, single, double, triple, or, multi, and, the, letter, c, is, often, omitted, in, the, abbreviation, for, example, multi, walled, carbon, nanotube, mwnt, the, international, standards, organization, uses, single, wall, or, multi, wall, in, its, documents, multi, walled, nanotubes, mwnts, consist, of, multiple, rolled, layers, concentric, tubes, of, graphene, there, are, two, models, that, can, be, used, to, describe, the, structures, of, multi, walled, nanotubes, in, the, russian, doll, model, sheets, of, graphite, are, arranged, in, concentric, cylinders, e, g, a, 0, 8, single, walled, nanotube, swnt, within, a, larger, 0, 17, single, walled, nanotube, in, the, parchment, model, a, single, sheet, of, graphite, is, rolled, in, around, itself, resembling, a, scroll, of, parchment, or, a, rolled, newspaper, the, interlayer, distance, in, multi, walled, nanotubes, is, close, to, the, distance, between, graphene, layers, in, graphite, approximately, 3, 4, the, russian, doll, structure, is, observed, more, commonly, its, individual, shells, can, be, described, as, swnts, which, can, be, metallic, or, semiconducting, because, of, statistical, probability, and, restrictions, on, the, relative, diameters, of, the, individual, tubes, one, of, the, shells, and, thus, the, whole, mwnt, is, usually, a, zero, gap, metal, double, walled, carbon, nanotubes, dwnts, form, a, special, class, of, nanotubes, because, their, morphology, and, properties, are, similar, to, those, of, swnts, but, they, are, more, resistant, to, attacks, by, chemicals, this, is, especially, important, when, it, is, necessary, to, graft, chemical, functions, to, the, surface, of, the, nanotubes, functionalization, to, add, properties, to, the, cnt, covalent, functionalization, of, swnts, will, break, some, c, c, double, bonds, leaving, holes, in, the, structure, on, the, nanotube, and, thus, modifying, both, its, mechanical, and, electrical, properties, in, the, case, of, dwnts, only, the, outer, wall, is, modified, dwnt, synthesis, on, the, gram, scale, by, the, ccvd, technique, was, first, proposed, in, 2003, from, the, selective, reduction, of, oxide, solutions, in, methane, and, hydrogen, the, telescopic, motion, ability, of, inner, shells, and, their, unique, mechanical, properties, will, permit, the, use, of, multi, walled, nanotubes, as, the, main, movable, arms, in, upcoming, nanomechanical, devices, the, retraction, force, that, occurs, to, telescopic, motion, is, caused, by, the, lennard, jones, interaction, between, shells, and, its, value, is, about, 1, 5, nn, junctions, between, two, or, more, nanotubes, have, been, widely, discussed, theoretically, such, junctions, are, quite, frequently, observed, in, samples, prepared, by, arc, discharge, as, well, as, by, chemical, vapor, deposition, the, electronic, properties, of, such, junctions, were, first, considered, theoretically, by, lambin, et, al, who, pointed, out, that, a, connection, between, a, metallic, tube, and, a, semiconducting, one, would, represent, a, nanoscale, heterojunction, such, a, junction, could, therefore, form, a, component, of, a, nanotube, based, electronic, circuit, the, adjacent, image, shows, a, junction, between, two, multiwalled, nanotubes, junctions, between, nanotubes, and, graphene, have, been, considered, theoretically, and, studied, experimentally, nanotube, graphene, junctions, form, the, basis, of, pillared, graphene, in, which, parallel, graphene, sheets, are, separated, by, short, nanotubes, pillared, graphene, represents, a, class, of, three, dimensional, carbon, nanotube, architectures, recently, several, studies, have, highlighted, the, prospect, of, using, carbon, nanotubes, as, building, blocks, to, fabricate, three, dimensional, macroscopic, 100, nm, in, all, three, dimensions, all, carbon, devices, lalwani, et, al, have, reported, a, novel, radical, initiated, thermal, crosslinking, method, to, fabricate, macroscopic, free, standing, porous, all, carbon, scaffolds, using, single, and, multi, walled, carbon, nanotubes, as, building, blocks, these, scaffolds, possess, macro, micro, and, nano, structured, pores, and, the, porosity, can, be, tailored, for, specific, applications, these, 3d, all, carbon, scaffolds, architectures, may, be, used, for, the, fabrication, of, the, next, generation, of, energy, storage, supercapacitors, field, emission, transistors, high, performance, catalysis, photovoltaics, and, biomedical, devices, implants, and, sensors, carbon, nanobuds, are, a, newly, created, material, combining, two, previously, discovered, allotropes, of, carbon, carbon, nanotubes, and, fullerenes, in, this, new, material, fullerene, like, buds, are, covalently, bonded, to, the, outer, sidewalls, of, the, underlying, carbon, nanotube, this, hybrid, material, has, useful, properties, of, both, fullerenes, and, carbon, nanotubes, in, particular, they, have, been, found, to, be, exceptionally, good, field, emitters, in, composite, materials, the, attached, fullerene, molecules, may, function, as, molecular, anchors, preventing, slipping, of, the, nanotubes, thus, improving, the, composite, s, mechanical, properties, a, carbon, peapod, is, a, novel, hybrid, carbon, material, which, traps, fullerene, inside, a, carbon, nanotube, it, can, possess, interesting, magnetic, properties, with, heating, and, irradiation, it, can, also, be, applied, as, an, oscillator, during, theoretical, investigations, and, predictions, in, theory, a, nanotorus, is, a, carbon, nanotube, bent, into, a, torus, doughnut, shape, nanotori, are, predicted, to, have, many, unique, properties, such, as, magnetic, moments, 1000, times, larger, than, that, previously, expected, for, certain, specific, radii, properties, such, as, magnetic, moment, thermal, stability, etc, vary, widely, depending, on, the, radius, of, the, torus, and, the, radius, of, the, tube, graphenated, carbon, nanotubes, are, a, relatively, new, hybrid, that, combines, graphitic, foliates, grown, along, the, sidewalls, of, multiwalled, or, bamboo, style, cnts, the, foliate, density, can, vary, as, a, function, of, deposition, conditions, e, g, temperature, and, time, with, their, structure, ranging, from, a, few, layers, of, graphene, 10, to, thicker, more, graphite, like, the, fundamental, advantage, of, an, integrated, graphene, cnt, structure, is, the, high, surface, area, three, dimensional, framework, of, the, cnts, coupled, with, the, high, edge, density, of, graphene, depositing, a, high, density, of, graphene, foliates, along, the, length, of, aligned, cnts, can, significantly, increase, the, total, charge, capacity, per, unit, of, nominal, area, as, compared, to, other, carbon, nanostructures, cup, stacked, carbon, nanotubes, cscnts, differ, from, other, quasi, 1d, carbon, structures, which, normally, behave, as, quasi, metallic, conductors, of, electrons, cscnts, exhibit, semiconducting, behavior, because, of, the, stacking, microstructure, of, graphene, layers, many, properties, of, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, depend, significantly, on, the, n, m, type, and, this, dependence, is, non, monotonic, see, kataura, plot, in, particular, the, band, gap, can, vary, from, zero, to, about, 2, ev, and, the, electrical, conductivity, can, show, metallic, or, semiconducting, behavior, carbon, nanotubes, are, the, strongest, and, stiffest, materials, yet, discovered, in, terms, of, tensile, strength, and, elastic, modulus, this, strength, results, from, the, covalent, sp, 2, bonds, formed, between, the, individual, carbon, atoms, in, 2000, a, multiwalled, carbon, nanotube, was, tested, to, have, a, tensile, strength, of, 63, gpa, 9, 100, 000, psi, for, illustration, this, translates, into, the, ability, to, endure, tension, of, a, weight, equivalent, to, 6, 422, kilograms, force, 62, 980, n, 14, 160, lbf, on, a, cable, with, cross, section, of, 1, mm, 2, 0, 0016, sq, in, further, studies, such, as, one, conducted, in, 2008, revealed, that, individual, cnt, shells, have, strengths, of, up, to, 100, gpa, 15, 000, 000, psi, which, is, in, agreement, with, quantum, atomistic, models, because, carbon, nanotubes, have, a, low, density, for, a, solid, of, 1, 3, to, 1, 4, g, cm, 3, its, specific, strength, of, up, to, 48, 000, kn, m, kg, is, the, best, of, known, materials, compared, to, high, carbon, steel, s, 154, kn, m, kg, although, the, strength, of, individual, cnt, shells, is, extremely, high, weak, shear, interactions, between, adjacent, shells, and, tubes, lead, to, significant, reduction, in, the, effective, strength, of, multiwalled, carbon, nanotubes, and, carbon, nanotube, bundles, down, to, only, a, few, gpa, this, limitation, has, been, recently, addressed, by, applying, high, energy, electron, irradiation, which, crosslinks, inner, shells, and, tubes, and, effectively, increases, the, strength, of, these, materials, to, 60, gpa, for, multiwalled, carbon, nanotubes, and, 17, gpa, for, double, walled, carbon, nanotube, bundles, cnts, are, not, nearly, as, strong, under, compression, because, of, their, hollow, structure, and, high, aspect, ratio, they, tend, to, undergo, buckling, when, placed, under, compressive, torsional, or, bending, stress, on, the, other, hand, there, was, evidence, that, in, the, radial, direction, they, are, rather, soft, the, first, transmission, electron, microscope, observation, of, radial, elasticity, suggested, that, even, van, der, waals, forces, can, deform, two, adjacent, nanotubes, later, nanoindentations, with, an, atomic, force, microscope, were, performed, by, several, groups, to, quantitatively, measure, the, radial, elasticity, of, multiwalled, carbon, nanotubes, and, tapping, contact, mode, atomic, force, microscopy, was, also, performed, on, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, young, s, modulus, of, on, the, order, of, several, gpa, showed, that, cnts, are, in, fact, very, soft, in, the, radial, direction, it, was, reported, in, 2020, that, cnt, filled, polymer, nanocomposites, with, 4, wt, and, 6, wt, loadings, are, the, most, optimal, concentrations, as, they, provide, a, good, balance, between, mechanical, properties, and, resilience, of, mechanical, properties, against, uv, exposure, for, the, offshore, umbilical, sheathing, layer, unlike, graphene, which, is, a, two, dimensional, semimetal, carbon, nanotubes, are, either, metallic, or, semiconducting, along, the, tubular, axis, for, a, given, n, m, nanotube, if, n, m, the, nanotube, is, metallic, if, n, m, is, a, multiple, of, 3, and, n, m, then, the, nanotube, is, quasi, metallic, with, a, very, small, band, gap, otherwise, the, nanotube, is, a, moderate, semiconductor, thus, all, armchair, n, m, nanotubes, are, metallic, and, nanotubes, 6, 4, 9, 1, etc, are, semiconducting, carbon, nanotubes, are, not, semimetallic, because, the, degenerate, point, the, point, where, the, band, meets, the, band, at, which, the, energy, goes, to, zero, is, slightly, shifted, away, from, the, k, point, in, the, brillouin, zone, because, of, the, curvature, of, the, tube, surface, causing, hybridization, between, the, and, anti, bonding, bands, modifying, the, band, dispersion, the, rule, regarding, metallic, versus, semiconductor, behavior, has, exceptions, because, curvature, effects, in, small, diameter, tubes, can, strongly, influence, electrical, properties, thus, a, 5, 0, swcnt, that, should, be, semiconducting, in, fact, is, metallic, according, to, the, calculations, likewise, zigzag, and, chiral, swcnts, with, small, diameters, that, should, be, metallic, have, a, finite, gap, armchair, nanotubes, remain, metallic, in, theory, metallic, nanotubes, can, carry, an, electric, current, density, of, 4, 10, 9, a, cm, 2, which, is, more, than, 1, 000, times, greater, than, those, of, metals, such, as, copper, where, for, copper, interconnects, current, densities, are, limited, by, electromigration, carbon, nanotubes, are, thus, being, explored, as, interconnects, and, conductivity, enhancing, components, in, composite, materials, and, many, groups, are, attempting, to, commercialize, highly, conducting, electrical, wire, assembled, from, individual, carbon, nanotubes, there, are, significant, challenges, to, be, overcome, however, such, as, undesired, current, saturation, under, voltage, and, the, much, more, resistive, nanotube, to, nanotube, junctions, and, impurities, all, of, which, lower, the, electrical, conductivity, of, the, macroscopic, nanotube, wires, by, orders, of, magnitude, as, compared, to, the, conductivity, of, the, individual, nanotubes, because, of, its, nanoscale, cross, section, electrons, propagate, only, along, the, tube, s, axis, as, a, result, carbon, nanotubes, are, frequently, referred, to, as, one, dimensional, conductors, the, maximum, electrical, conductance, of, a, single, walled, carbon, nanotube, is, 2, g, 0, where, g, 0, 2, e, 2, h, is, the, conductance, of, a, single, ballistic, quantum, channel, because, of, the, role, of, the, electron, system, in, determining, the, electronic, properties, of, graphene, doping, in, carbon, nanotubes, differs, from, that, of, bulk, crystalline, semiconductors, from, the, same, group, of, the, periodic, table, e, g, silicon, graphitic, substitution, of, carbon, atoms, in, the, nanotube, wall, by, boron, or, nitrogen, dopants, leads, to, p, type, and, n, type, behavior, respectively, as, would, be, expected, in, silicon, however, some, non, substitutional, intercalated, or, adsorbed, dopants, introduced, into, a, carbon, nanotube, such, as, alkali, metals, and, electron, rich, metallocenes, result, in, n, type, conduction, because, they, donate, electrons, to, the, electron, system, of, the, nanotube, by, contrast, electron, acceptors, such, as, fecl, 3, or, electron, deficient, metallocenes, function, as, p, type, dopants, because, they, draw, electrons, away, from, the, top, of, the, valence, band, intrinsic, superconductivity, has, been, reported, although, other, experiments, found, no, evidence, of, this, leaving, the, claim, a, subject, of, debate, in, 2021, michael, strano, the, carbon, p, dubbs, professor, of, chemical, engineering, at, mit, published, department, findings, on, the, use, of, carbon, nanotubes, to, create, an, electric, current, by, immersing, the, structures, in, an, organic, solvent, the, liquid, drew, electrons, out, of, the, carbon, particles, strano, was, quoted, as, saying, this, allows, you, to, do, electrochemistry, but, with, no, wires, and, represents, a, significant, breakthrough, in, the, technology, future, applications, include, powering, micro, or, nanoscale, robots, as, well, as, driving, alcohol, oxidation, reactions, which, are, important, in, the, chemicals, industry, crystallographic, defects, also, affect, the, tube, s, electrical, properties, a, common, result, is, lowered, conductivity, through, the, defective, region, of, the, tube, a, defect, in, metallic, armchair, type, tubes, which, can, conduct, electricity, can, cause, the, surrounding, region, to, become, semiconducting, and, single, monatomic, vacancies, induce, magnetic, properties, carbon, nanotubes, have, useful, absorption, photoluminescence, fluorescence, and, raman, spectroscopy, properties, spectroscopic, methods, offer, the, possibility, of, quick, and, non, destructive, characterization, of, relatively, large, amounts, of, carbon, nanotubes, there, is, a, strong, demand, for, such, characterization, from, the, industrial, point, of, view, numerous, parameters, of, nanotube, synthesis, can, be, changed, intentionally, or, unintentionally, to, alter, the, nanotube, quality, such, as, the, non, tubular, carbon, content, structure, chirality, of, the, produced, nanotubes, and, structural, defects, these, features, then, determine, nearly, all, other, significant, optical, mechanical, and, electrical, properties, carbon, nanotube, optical, properties, have, been, explored, for, use, in, applications, such, as, for, light, emitting, diodes, leds, and, photo, detectors, based, on, a, single, nanotube, have, been, produced, in, the, lab, their, unique, feature, is, not, the, efficiency, which, is, yet, relatively, low, but, the, narrow, selectivity, in, the, wavelength, of, emission, and, detection, of, light, and, the, possibility, of, its, fine, tuning, through, the, nanotube, structure, in, addition, bolometer, and, optoelectronic, memory, devices, have, been, realised, on, ensembles, of, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, nanotube, fluorescence, has, been, investigated, for, the, purposes, of, imaging, and, sensing, in, biomedical, applications, all, nanotubes, are, expected, to, be, very, good, thermal, conductors, along, the, tube, exhibiting, a, property, known, as, ballistic, conduction, but, good, insulators, lateral, to, the, tube, axis, measurements, show, that, an, individual, swnt, has, a, room, temperature, thermal, conductivity, along, its, axis, of, about, 3500, w, m, 1, k, 1, compare, this, to, copper, a, metal, well, known, for, its, good, thermal, conductivity, which, transmits, 385, w, m, 1, k, 1, an, individual, swnt, has, a, room, temperature, thermal, conductivity, lateral, to, its, axis, in, the, radial, direction, of, about, 1, 52, w, m, 1, k, 1, which, is, about, as, thermally, conductive, as, soil, macroscopic, assemblies, of, nanotubes, such, as, films, or, fibres, have, reached, up, to, 1500, w, m, 1, k, 1, so, far, networks, composed, of, nanotubes, demonstrate, different, values, of, thermal, conductivity, from, the, level, of, thermal, insulation, with, the, thermal, conductivity, of, 0, 1, w, m, 1, k, 1, to, such, high, values, that, is, dependent, on, the, amount, of, contribution, to, the, thermal, resistance, of, the, system, caused, by, the, presence, of, impurities, misalignments, and, other, factors, the, temperature, stability, of, carbon, nanotubes, is, estimated, to, be, up, to, 2800, c, in, vacuum, and, about, 750, c, in, air, crystallographic, defects, strongly, affect, the, tube, s, thermal, properties, such, defects, lead, to, phonon, scattering, which, in, turn, increases, the, relaxation, rate, of, the, phonons, this, reduces, the, mean, free, path, and, reduces, the, thermal, conductivity, of, nanotube, structures, phonon, transport, simulations, indicate, that, substitutional, defects, such, as, nitrogen, or, boron, will, primarily, lead, to, the, scattering, of, high, frequency, optical, phonons, however, larger, scale, defects, such, as, stone, wales, defects, cause, phonon, scattering, over, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, leading, to, a, greater, reduction, in, thermal, conductivity, techniques, have, been, developed, to, produce, nanotubes, in, sizeable, quantities, including, arc, discharge, laser, ablation, chemical, vapor, deposition, cvd, and, high, pressure, carbon, monoxide, disproportionation, hipco, among, these, arc, discharge, laser, ablation, are, batch, by, batch, process, chemical, vapor, deposition, can, be, used, both, for, batch, by, batch, or, continuous, processes, and, hipco, is, gas, phase, continuous, process, most, of, these, processes, take, place, in, a, vacuum, or, with, process, gases, the, cvd, growth, method, is, popular, as, it, yields, high, quantity, and, has, a, degree, of, control, over, diameter, length, and, morphology, using, particulate, catalysts, large, quantities, of, nanotubes, can, be, synthesized, by, these, methods, and, industrialisation, is, well, on, its, way, with, several, cnt, and, cnt, fibers, factory, around, the, world, one, problem, of, cvd, processes, is, the, high, variability, in, the, nanotube, s, characteristics, the, hipco, process, advances, in, catalysis, and, continuous, growth, are, making, cnts, more, commercially, viable, the, hipco, process, helps, in, producing, high, purity, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, in, higher, quantity, the, hipco, reactor, operates, at, high, temperature, 900, 1100, c, and, high, pressure, 30, 50, bar, it, uses, carbon, monoxide, as, the, carbon, source, and, iron, pentacarbonyl, or, nickel, tetracarbonyl, as, a, catalyst, these, catalysts, provide, a, nucleation, site, for, the, nanotubes, to, grow, while, cheaper, iron, based, catalysts, like, ferrocene, can, be, used, for, cvd, process, vertically, aligned, carbon, nanotube, arrays, are, also, grown, by, thermal, chemical, vapor, deposition, a, substrate, quartz, silicon, stainless, steel, carbon, fibers, etc, is, coated, with, a, catalytic, metal, fe, co, ni, layer, typically, that, layer, is, iron, and, is, deposited, via, sputtering, to, a, thickness, of, 1, 5, nm, a, 10, 50, nm, underlayer, of, alumina, is, often, also, put, down, on, the, substrate, first, this, imparts, controllable, wetting, and, good, interfacial, properties, when, the, substrate, is, heated, to, the, growth, temperature, 600, to, 850, c, the, continuous, iron, film, breaks, up, into, small, islands, with, each, island, then, nucleating, a, carbon, nanotube, the, sputtered, thickness, controls, the, island, size, and, this, in, turn, determines, the, nanotube, diameter, thinner, iron, layers, drive, down, the, diameter, of, the, islands, and, drive, down, the, diameter, of, the, nanotubes, grown, the, amount, of, time, the, metal, island, can, sit, at, the, growth, temperature, is, limited, as, they, are, mobile, and, can, merge, into, larger, but, fewer, islands, annealing, at, the, growth, temperature, reduces, the, site, density, number, of, cnt, mm, 2, while, increasing, the, catalyst, diameter, the, as, prepared, carbon, nanotubes, always, have, impurities, such, as, other, forms, of, carbon, amorphous, carbon, fullerene, etc, and, non, carbonaceous, impurities, metal, used, for, catalyst, these, impurities, need, to, be, removed, to, make, use, of, the, carbon, nanotubes, in, applications, as, synthesized, carbon, nanotubes, typically, contain, impurities, and, most, importantly, different, chiralities, of, carbon, nanotubes, therefore, multiple, methods, have, been, developed, to, purify, them, including, polymer, assisted, density, gradient, ultracentrifugation, dgu, chromatography, and, aqueous, two, phase, extraction, atpe, these, methods, have, been, reviewed, in, multiple, articles, certain, polymers, selectively, disperse, or, wrap, cnts, of, a, particular, chirality, metallic, character, or, diameter, for, example, poly, phenylenevinylenes, disperses, cnts, of, specific, diameters, 0, 75, 0, 84, nm, and, polyfluorenes, are, highly, selective, for, semiconducting, cnts, it, involves, mainly, two, steps, sonicate, the, mixture, cnts, and, polymers, in, solvent, centrifuge, and, the, supernatant, are, desired, cnts, density, gradient, ultracentrifugation, is, a, method, based, on, the, density, difference, of, cnts, so, that, different, components, are, layered, in, centrifuge, tubes, under, centrifugal, force, chromatography, based, methods, include, size, exclusion, sec, ion, exchange, iex, and, gel, chromatography, for, sec, cnts, are, separated, due, to, the, difference, in, size, using, a, stationary, phase, with, different, pore, size, as, for, iex, the, separation, is, achieved, based, on, their, differential, adsorption, and, desorption, onto, chemically, functionalized, resins, packed, in, an, iex, column, so, understanding, the, interaction, between, cnts, mixtures, and, resins, is, important, the, first, iex, is, reported, to, separate, dna, swcnts, gel, chromatography, is, based, on, the, partition, of, cnts, between, stationary, and, mobile, phase, it, s, found, semiconducting, cnts, are, more, strongly, attracted, by, gel, than, metallic, cnts, while, it, shows, potential, the, current, application, is, limited, to, the, separation, of, semiconducting, n, m, species, atpe, uses, two, water, soluble, polymers, such, as, polyethylene, glycol, peg, and, dextran, when, mixed, two, immiscible, aqueous, phases, form, spontaneously, and, each, of, the, two, phases, shows, a, different, affinity, to, cnts, partition, depends, on, the, solvation, energy, difference, between, two, similar, phases, of, microscale, volumes, by, changing, the, separation, system, or, temperatures, and, adding, strong, oxidants, reductants, or, salts, the, partition, of, cnts, species, into, the, two, phases, can, be, adjusted, despite, the, progress, that, has, been, made, to, separate, and, purify, cnts, many, challenges, remain, such, as, the, growth, of, chirality, controlled, cnts, so, that, no, further, purification, is, needed, or, large, scale, purification, monochiral, cnts, have, the, advantage, that, they, do, contain, less, or, no, impurities, well, defined, non, congested, optical, spectra, this, allows, to, create, for, example, cnt, based, biosensors, with, higher, sensitivity, and, selectivity, for, example, monochiral, swcnts, are, necessary, for, multiplexed, and, ratiometric, sensing, schemes, enhanced, sensitivity, of, biocompatibility, cnts, are, known, to, have, weak, dispersibility, in, many, solvents, such, as, water, as, a, consequence, of, strong, intermolecular, p, p, interactions, this, hinders, the, processability, of, cnts, in, industrial, applications, to, tackle, the, issue, various, techniques, have, been, developed, to, modify, the, surface, of, cnts, in, order, to, improve, their, stability, and, solubility, in, water, this, enhances, the, processing, and, manipulation, of, insoluble, cnts, rendering, them, useful, for, synthesizing, innovative, cnt, nanofluids, with, impressive, properties, that, are, tunable, for, a, wide, range, of, applications, chemical, routes, such, as, covalent, functionalization, have, been, studied, extensively, which, involves, the, oxidation, of, cnts, via, strong, acids, e, g, sulfuric, acid, nitric, acid, or, a, mixture, of, both, in, order, to, set, the, carboxylic, groups, onto, the, surface, of, the, cnts, as, the, final, product, or, for, further, modification, by, esterification, or, amination, free, radical, grafting, is, a, promising, technique, among, covalent, functionalization, methods, in, which, alkyl, or, aryl, peroxides, substituted, anilines, and, diazonium, salts, are, used, as, the, starting, agents, free, radical, grafting, of, macromolecules, as, the, functional, group, onto, the, surface, of, cnts, can, improve, the, solubility, of, cnts, compared, to, common, acid, treatments, which, involve, the, attachment, of, small, molecules, such, as, hydroxyl, onto, the, surface, of, cnts, the, solubility, of, cnts, can, be, improved, significantly, by, free, radical, grafting, because, the, large, functional, molecules, facilitate, the, dispersion, of, cnts, in, a, variety, of, solvents, even, at, a, low, degree, of, functionalization, recently, an, innovative, environmentally, friendly, approach, has, been, developed, for, the, covalent, functionalization, of, multi, walled, carbon, nanotubes, mwcnts, using, clove, buds, this, approach, is, innovative, and, green, because, it, does, not, use, toxic, and, hazardous, acids, which, are, typically, used, in, common, carbon, nanomaterial, functionalization, procedures, the, mwcnts, are, functionalized, in, one, pot, using, a, free, radical, grafting, reaction, the, clove, functionalized, mwcnts, are, then, dispersed, in, water, producing, a, highly, stable, multi, walled, carbon, nanotube, aqueous, suspension, nanofluids, carbon, nanotubes, are, modelled, in, a, similar, manner, as, traditional, composites, in, which, a, reinforcement, phase, is, surrounded, by, a, matrix, phase, ideal, models, such, as, cylindrical, hexagonal, and, square, models, are, common, the, size, of, the, micromechanics, model, is, highly, function, of, the, studied, mechanical, properties, the, concept, of, representative, volume, element, rve, is, used, to, determine, the, appropriate, size, and, configuration, of, the, computer, model, to, replicate, the, actual, behavior, of, the, cnt, reinforced, nanocomposite, depending, on, the, material, property, of, interest, thermal, electrical, modulus, creep, one, rve, might, predict, the, property, better, than, the, alternatives, while, the, implementation, of, the, ideal, model, is, computationally, efficient, they, do, not, represent, microstructural, features, observed, in, scanning, electron, microscopy, of, actual, nanocomposites, to, incorporate, realistic, modeling, computer, models, are, also, generated, to, incorporate, variability, such, as, waviness, orientation, and, agglomeration, of, multiwall, or, single, wall, carbon, nanotubes, there, are, many, metrology, standards, and, reference,

functionalized, to, attain, desired, properties, that, can, be, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, the, two, main, methods, of, carbon, nanotube, functionalization, are, covalent, and, non, covalent, modifications, because, of, their, apparent, hydrophobic, nature, carbon, nanotubes, tend, to, agglomerate, hindering, their, dispersion, in, solvents, or, viscous, polymer, melts, the, resulting, nanotube, bundles, or, aggregates, reduce, the, mechanical, performance, of, the, final, composite, the, surface, of, the, carbon, nanotubes, can, be, modified, to, reduce, the,

for, applications, in, energy, and, electrochemical, water, treatment, when, coated, with, an, ion, exchange, membrane, also, cnt, based, yarns, could, replace, copper, as, a, winding, material, pyrh, nen, et, al, 2015, have, built, a, motor, using, cnt, winding, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, is, the, leading, united, states, federal, agency, conducting, research, and, providing, guidance, on, the, occupational, safety, and, health, implications, and, applications, of, nanomaterials, early, scientific, studies, have, indicated, that, nanoscale, particles, may, pose, a, greater, health, risk, than, bulk, materials, due, to, a, relative, increase, in, surface, area, per, unit, mass, increase, in, length, and, diameter, of, cnt, is, correlated, to, increased, toxicity, and, pathological, alterations, in, lung, the, biological, interactions, of, nanotubes, are, not, well, understood, and, the, field, is, open, to, continued, toxicological, studies, it, is, often, difficult, to, separate, confounding, factors, and, since, carbon, is, relatively, biologically, inert, some, of, the, toxicity, attributed, to, carbon, nanotubes, may, be, instead, due, to, residual, metal, catalyst, contamination, in, previous, studies, only, mitsui, 7, was, reliably, demonstrated, to, be, carcinogenic, although, for, unclear, unknown, reasons, unlike, many, common, mineral, fibers, such, as, asbestos, most, swcnts, and, mwcnts, do, not, fit, the, size, and, aspect, ratio, criteria, to, be, classified, as, respirable, fibers, in, 2013, given, that, the, long, term, health, effects, have, not, yet, been, measured, niosh, published, a, current, intelligence, bulletin, detailing, the, potential, hazards, and, recommended, exposure, limit, for, carbon, nanotubes, and, fibers, the, u, s, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, has, determined, non, regulatory, recommended, exposure, limits, rels, of, 1, g, m, 3, for, carbon, nanotubes, and, carbon, nanofibers, as, background, corrected, elemental, carbon, as, an, 8, hour, time, weighted, average, twa, respirable, mass, concentration, although, cnt, caused, pulmonary, inflammation, and, toxicity, in, mice, exposure, to, aerosols, generated, from, sanding, of, composites, containing, polymer, coated, mwcnts, representative, of, the, actual, end, product, did, not, exert, such, toxicity, as, of, october, 2016, single, wall, carbon, nanotubes, have, been, registered, through, the, european, union, s, registration, evaluation, authorization, and, restriction, of, chemicals, reach, regulations, based, on, evaluation, of, the, potentially, hazardous, properties, of, swcnt, based, on, this, registration, swcnt, commercialization, is, allowed, in, the, eu, up, to, 100, metric, tons, currently, the, type, of, swcnt, registered, through, reach, is, limited, to, the, specific, type, of, single, wall, carbon, nanotubes, manufactured, by, ocsial, which, submitted, the, application, the, true, identity, of, the, discoverers, of, carbon, nanotubes, is, a, subject, of, some, controversy, a, 2006, editorial, written, by, marc, monthioux, and, vladimir, kuznetsov, in, the, journal, carbon, described, the, origin, of, the, carbon, nanotube, a, large, percentage, of, academic, and, popular, literature, attributes, the, discovery, of, hollow, nanometre, size, tubes, composed, of, graphitic, carbon, to, sumio, iijima, of, nec, in, 1991, his, paper, initiated, a, flurry, of, excitement, and, could, be, credited, with, inspiring, the, many, scientists, now, studying, applications, of, carbon, nanotubes, though, iijima, has, been, given, much, of, the, credit, for, discovering, carbon, nanotubes, it, turns, out, that, the, timeline, of, carbon, nanotubes, goes, back, much, further, than, 1991, in, 1952, l, v, radushkevich, and, v, m, lukyanovich, published, clear, images, of, 50, nanometre, diameter, tubes, made, of, carbon, in, the, journal, of, physical, chemistry, of, russia, this, discovery, was, largely, unnoticed, as, the, article, was, published, in, russian, and, western, scientists, access, to, soviet, press, was, limited, during, the, cold, war, monthioux, and, kuznetsov, mentioned, in, their, carbon, editorial, the, fact, is, radushkevich, and, lukyanovich, should, be, credited, for, the, discovery, that, carbon, filaments, could, be, hollow, and, have, a, nanometre, size, diameter, that, is, to, say, for, the, discovery, of, carbon, nanotubes, in, 1976, morinobu, endo, of, cnrs, observed, hollow, tubes, of, rolled, up, graphite, sheets, synthesised, by, a, chemical, vapour, growth, technique, the, first, specimens, observed, would, later, come, to, be, known, as, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, swnts, endo, in, his, early, review, of, vapor, phase, grown, carbon, fibers, vpcf, also, reminded, us, that, he, had, observed, a, hollow, tube, linearly, extended, with, parallel, carbon, layer, faces, near, the, fiber, core, this, appears, to, be, the, observation, of, multi, walled, carbon, nanotubes, at, the, center, of, the, fiber, the, mass, produced, mwcnts, today, are, strongly, related, to, the, vpgcf, developed, by, endo, in, fact, they, call, it, the, endo, process, out, of, respect, for, his, early, work, and, patents, in, 1979, john, abrahamson, presented, evidence, of, carbon, nanotubes, at, the, 14th, biennial, conference, of, carbon, at, pennsylvania, state, university, the, conference, paper, described, carbon, nanotubes, as, carbon, fibers, that, were, produced, on, carbon, anodes, during, arc, discharge, a, characterization, of, these, fibers, was, given, as, well, as, hypotheses, for, their, growth, in, a, nitrogen, atmosphere, at, low, pressures, in, 1981, a, group, of, soviet, scientists, published, the, results, of, chemical, and, structural, characterization, of, carbon, nanoparticles, produced, by, a, thermocatalytic, disproportionation, of, carbon, monoxide, using, tem, images, and, xrd, patterns, the, authors, suggested, that, their, carbon, multi, layer, tubular, crystals, were, formed, by, rolling, graphene, layers, into, cylinders, they, speculated, that, via, this, rolling, many, different, arrangements, of, graphene, hexagonal, nets, are, possible, they, suggested, two, such, possible, arrangements, a, circular, arrangement, armchair, nanotube, and, a, spiral, helical, arrangement, chiral, tube, in, 1987, howard, g, tennent, of, hyperion, catalysis, was, issued, a, u, s, patent, for, the, production, of, cylindrical, discrete, carbon, fibrils, with, a, constant, diameter, between, about, 3, 5, and, about, 70, nanometers, length, 10, 2, times, the, diameter, and, an, outer, region, of, multiple, essentially, continuous, layers, of, ordered, carbon, atoms, and, a, distinct, inner, core, helping, to, create, the, initial, excitement, associated, with, carbon, nanotubes, were, iijima, s, 1991, discovery, of, multi, walled, carbon, nanotubes, in, the, insoluble, material, of, arc, burned, graphite, rods, and, mintmire, dunlap, and, white, s, independent, prediction, that, if, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, could, be, made, they, would, exhibit, remarkable, conducting, properties, nanotube, research, accelerated, greatly, following, the, independent, discoveries, by, iijima, and, ichihashi, at, nec, and, bethune, et, al, at, ibm, of, methods, to, specifically, produce, single, walled, carbon, nanotubes, by, adding, transition, metal, catalysts, to, the, carbon, in, an, arc, discharge, thess, et, al, refined, this, catalytic, method, by, vaporizing, the, carbon, transition, metal, combination, in, a, high, temperature, furnace, which, greatly, improved, the, yield, and, purity, of, the, swnts, and, made, them, widely, available, for, characterization, and, application, experiments, the, arc, discharge, technique, well, known, to, produce, the, famed, buckminsterfullerene, on, a, preparative, scale, thus, played, a, role, in, the, discoveries, of, both, multi, and, single, wall, nanotubes, extending, the, run, of, serendipitous, discoveries, relating, to, fullerenes, the, discovery, of, nanotubes, remains, a, contentious, issue, many, believe, that, iijima, s, report, in, 1991, is, of, particular, importance, because, it, brought, carbon, nanotubes, into, the, awareness, of, the, scientific, community, as, a, whole, in, 2020, during, an, archaeological, excavation, of, keezhadi, in, tamil, nadu, india, 2600, year, old, pottery, was, discovered, whose, coatings, appear, to, contain, carbon, nanotubes, the, robust, mechanical, properties, of, the, nanotubes, are, partially, why, the, coatings, have, lasted, for, so, many, years, say, the, scientists,
