the, cosmic, distance, ladder, also, known, as, the, extragalactic, distance, scale, is, the, succession, of, methods, by, which, astronomers, determine, the, distances, to, celestial, objects, a, direct, distance, measurement, of, an, astronomical, object, is, possible, only, for, those, objects, that, are, close, enough, within, about, a, thousand, parsecs, to, earth, the, techniques, for, determining, distances, to, more, distant, objects, are, all, based, on, various, measured, correlations, between, methods, that, work, at, close, distances, and, methods, that, work, at, larger, distances, several, methods, rely, on, a, standard, candle, which, is, an, astronomical, object, that, has, a, known, luminosity, the, ladder, analogy, arises, because, no, single, technique, can, measure, distances, at, all, ranges, encountered, in, astronomy, instead, one, method, can, be, used, to, measure, nearby, distances, a, second, can, be, used, to, measure, nearby, to, intermediate, distances, and, so, on, each, rung, of, the, ladder, provides, information, that, can, be, used, to, determine, the, distances, at, the, next, higher, rung, at, the, base, of, the, ladder, are, fundamental, distance, measurements, in, which, distances, are, determined, directly, with, no, physical, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, the, object, in, question, the, precise, measurement, of, stellar, positions, is, part, of, the, discipline, of, astrometry, early, fundamental, distances, such, as, the, radii, of, the, earth, moon, and, sun, and, the, distances, between, them, were, well, estimated, with, very, low, technology, by, the, ancient, greeks, direct, distance, measurements, are, based, upon, the, astronomical, unit, au, which, is, defined, as, the, mean, distance, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, kepler, s, laws, provide, precise, ratios, of, the, orbit, sizes, of, objects, orbiting, the, sun, but, provide, no, measurement, of, the, overall, scale, of, the, orbit, system, radar, is, used, to, measure, the, distance, between, the, orbits, of, the, earth, and, of, a, second, body, from, that, measurement, and, the, ratio, of, the, two, orbit, sizes, the, size, of, earth, s, orbit, is, calculated, the, earth, s, orbit, is, known, with, an, absolute, precision, of, a, few, meters, and, a, relative, precision, of, a, few, parts, in, 100, billion, 1, 10, 11, historically, observations, of, venus, transits, were, crucial, in, determining, the, au, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, observations, of, asteroids, were, also, important, presently, the, orbit, of, earth, is, determined, with, high, precision, using, radar, measurements, of, distances, to, venus, and, other, nearby, planets, and, asteroids, and, by, tracking, interplanetary, spacecraft, in, their, orbits, around, the, sun, through, the, solar, system, the, most, important, fundamental, distance, measurements, in, astronomy, come, from, trigonometric, parallax, as, applied, in, the, stellar, parallax, method, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, the, position, of, nearby, stars, will, appear, to, shift, slightly, against, the, more, distant, background, these, shifts, are, angles, in, an, isosceles, triangle, with, 2, au, the, distance, between, the, extreme, positions, of, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, making, the, base, leg, of, the, triangle, and, the, distance, to, the, star, being, the, long, equal, length, legs, the, amount, of, shift, is, quite, small, even, for, the, nearest, stars, measuring, 1, arcsecond, for, an, object, at, 1, parsec, s, distance, 3, 26, light, years, and, thereafter, decreasing, in, angular, amount, as, the, distance, increases, astronomers, usually, express, distances, in, units, of, parsecs, parallax, arcseconds, light, years, are, used, in, popular, media, because, parallax, becomes, smaller, for, a, greater, stellar, distance, useful, distances, can, be, measured, only, for, stars, which, are, near, enough, to, have, a, parallax, larger, than, a, few, times, the, precision, of, the, measurement, in, the, 1990s, for, example, the, hipparcos, mission, obtained, parallaxes, for, over, a, hundred, thousand, stars, with, a, precision, of, about, a, milliarcsecond, providing, useful, distances, for, stars, out, to, a, few, hundred, parsecs, the, hubble, space, telescope, s, wide, field, camera, 3, has, the, potential, to, provide, a, precision, of, 20, to, 40, micro, arcseconds, enabling, reliable, distance, measurements, up, to, 5, 000, parsecs, 16, 000, ly, for, small, numbers, of, stars, the, gaia, space, mission, provided, similarly, accurate, distances, to, most, stars, brighter, than, 15th, magnitude, distances, can, be, measured, within, 10, as, far, as, the, galactic, center, about, 30, 000, light, years, away, stars, have, a, velocity, relative, to, the, sun, that, causes, proper, motion, transverse, across, the, sky, and, radial, velocity, motion, toward, or, away, from, the, sun, the, former, is, determined, by, plotting, the, changing, position, of, the, stars, over, many, years, while, the, latter, comes, from, measuring, the, doppler, shift, of, the, star, s, spectrum, caused, by, motion, along, the, line, of, sight, for, a, group, of, stars, with, the, same, spectral, class, and, a, similar, magnitude, range, a, mean, parallax, can, be, derived, from, statistical, analysis, of, the, proper, motions, relative, to, their, radial, velocities, this, statistical, parallax, method, is, useful, for, measuring, the, distances, of, bright, stars, beyond, 50, parsecs, and, giant, variable, stars, including, cepheids, and, the, rr, lyrae, variables, the, motion, of, the, sun, through, space, provides, a, longer, baseline, that, will, increase, the, accuracy, of, parallax, measurements, known, as, secular, parallax, for, stars, in, the, milky, way, disk, this, corresponds, to, a, mean, baseline, of, 4, au, per, year, while, for, halo, stars, the, baseline, is, 40, au, per, year, after, several, decades, the, baseline, can, be, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, earth, sun, baseline, used, for, traditional, parallax, however, secular, parallax, introduces, a, higher, level, of, uncertainty, because, the, relative, velocity, of, observed, stars, is, an, additional, unknown, when, applied, to, samples, of, multiple, stars, the, uncertainty, can, be, reduced, the, uncertainty, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, sample, size, moving, cluster, parallax, is, a, technique, where, the, motions, of, individual, stars, in, a, nearby, star, cluster, can, be, used, to, find, the, distance, to, the, cluster, only, open, clusters, are, near, enough, for, this, technique, to, be, useful, in, particular, the, distance, obtained, for, the, hyades, has, historically, been, an, important, step, in, the, distance, ladder, other, individual, objects, can, have, fundamental, distance, estimates, made, for, them, under, special, circumstances, if, the, expansion, of, a, gas, cloud, like, a, supernova, remnant, or, planetary, nebula, can, be, observed, over, time, then, an, expansion, parallax, distance, to, that, cloud, can, be, estimated, those, measurements, however, suffer, from, uncertainties, in, the, deviation, of, the, object, from, sphericity, binary, stars, which, are, both, visual, and, spectroscopic, binaries, also, can, have, their, distance, estimated, by, similar, means, and, do, not, suffer, from, the, above, geometric, uncertainty, the, common, characteristic, to, these, methods, is, that, a, measurement, of, angular, motion, is, combined, with, a, measurement, of, the, absolute, velocity, usually, obtained, via, the, doppler, effect, the, distance, estimate, comes, from, computing, how, far, the, object, must, be, to, make, its, observed, absolute, velocity, appear, with, the, observed, angular, motion, almost, all, astronomical, objects, used, as, physical, distance, indicators, belong, to, a, class, that, has, a, known, brightness, by, comparing, this, known, luminosity, to, an, object, s, observed, brightness, the, distance, to, the, object, can, be, computed, using, the, inverse, square, law, these, objects, of, known, brightness, are, termed, standard, candles, coined, by, henrietta, swan, leavitt, the, brightness, of, an, object, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, its, absolute, magnitude, this, quantity, is, derived, from, the, logarithm, of, its, luminosity, as, seen, from, a, distance, of, 10, parsecs, the, apparent, magnitude, the, magnitude, as, seen, by, the, observer, an, instrument, called, a, bolometer, is, used, can, be, measured, and, used, with, the, absolute, magnitude, to, calculate, the, distance, d, to, the, object, in, parsecs, as, follows, 5, log, 10, d, m, m, 5, displaystyle, 5, cdot, log, 10, d, m, m, 5, or, d, 10, m, m, 5, 5, displaystyle, d, 10, m, m, 5, 5, where, m, is, the, apparent, magnitude, and, m, the, absolute, magnitude, for, this, to, be, accurate, both, magnitudes, must, be, in, the, same, frequency, band, and, there, can, be, no, relative, motion, in, the, radial, direction, some, means, of, correcting, for, interstellar, extinction, which, also, makes, objects, appear, fainter, and, more, red, is, needed, especially, if, the, object, lies, within, a, dusty, or, gaseous, region, the, difference, between, an, object, s, absolute, and, apparent, magnitudes, is, called, its, distance, modulus, and, astronomical, distances, especially, intergalactic, ones, are, sometimes, tabulated, in, this, way, two, problems, exist, for, any, class, of, standard, candle, the, principal, one, is, calibration, that, is, the, determination, of, exactly, what, the, absolute, magnitude, of, the, candle, is, this, includes, defining, the, class, well, enough, that, members, can, be, recognized, and, finding, enough, members, of, that, class, with, well, known, distances, to, allow, their, true, absolute, magnitude, to, be, determined, with, enough, accuracy, the, second, problem, lies, in, recognizing, members, of, the, class, and, not, mistakenly, using, a, standard, candle, calibration, on, an, object, which, does, not, belong, to, the, class, at, extreme, distances, which, is, where, one, most, wishes, to, use, a, distance, indicator, this, recognition, problem, can, be, quite, serious, a, significant, issue, with, standard, candles, is, the, recurring, question, of, how, standard, they, are, for, example, all, observations, seem, to, indicate, that, type, ia, supernovae, that, are, of, known, distance, have, the, same, brightness, corrected, by, the, shape, of, the, light, curve, the, basis, for, this, closeness, in, brightness, is, discussed, below, however, the, possibility, exists, that, the, distant, type, ia, supernovae, have, different, properties, than, nearby, type, ia, supernovae, the, use, of, type, ia, supernovae, is, crucial, in, determining, the, correct, cosmological, model, if, indeed, the, properties, of, type, ia, supernovae, are, different, at, large, distances, i, e, if, the, extrapolation, of, their, calibration, to, arbitrary, distances, is, not, valid, ignoring, this, variation, can, dangerously, bias, the, reconstruction, of, the, cosmological, parameters, in, particular, the, reconstruction, of, the, matter, density, parameter, that, this, is, not, merely, a, philosophical, issue, can, be, seen, from, the, history, of, distance, measurements, using, cepheid, variables, in, the, 1950s, walter, baade, discovered, that, the, nearby, cepheid, variables, used, to, calibrate, the, standard, candle, were, of, a, different, type, than, the, ones, used, to, measure, distances, to, nearby, galaxies, the, nearby, cepheid, variables, were, population, i, stars, with, much, higher, metal, content, than, the, distant, population, ii, stars, as, a, result, the, population, ii, stars, were, actually, much, brighter, than, believed, and, when, corrected, this, had, the, effect, of, doubling, the, estimates, of, distances, to, the, globular, clusters, the, nearby, galaxies, and, the, diameter, of, the, milky, way, most, recently, kilonova, have, been, proposed, as, another, type, of, standard, candle, since, kilonovae, explosions, are, spherical, astronomers, could, compare, the, apparent, size, of, a, supernova, explosion, with, its, actual, size, as, seen, by, the, gas, motion, and, thus, measure, the, rate, of, cosmic, expansion, at, different, distances, gravitational, waves, originating, from, the, inspiral, phase, of, compact, binary, systems, such, as, neutron, stars, or, black, holes, have, the, useful, property, that, energy, emitted, as, gravitational, radiation, comes, exclusively, from, the, orbital, energy, of, the, pair, and, the, resultant, shrinking, of, their, orbits, is, directly, observable, as, an, increase, in, the, frequency, of, the, emitted, gravitational, waves, to, leading, order, the, rate, of, change, of, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, is, given, by, 38, d, f, d, t, 96, 8, 3, g, m, 5, 3, f, 11, 3, 5, c, 5, displaystyle, frac, df, dt, frac, 96, pi, 8, 3, g, mathcal, m, frac, 5, 3, f, frac, 11, 3, 5, c, 5, where, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, and, m, displaystyle, mathcal, m, is, a, single, therefore, computable, number, called, the, chirp, mass, of, the, system, a, combination, of, the, masses, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, m, 1, m, 2, of, the, two, objects, m, m, 1, m, 2, 3, 5, m, 1, m, 2, 1, 5, displaystyle, mathcal, m, frac, m, 1, m, 2, 3, 5, m, 1, m, 2, 1, 5, by, observing, the, waveform, the, chirp, mass, can, be, computed, and, thence, the, power, rate, of, energy, emission, of, the, gravitational, waves, thus, such, a, gravitational, wave, source, is, a, standard, siren, of, known, loudness, just, as, with, standard, candles, given, the, emitted, and, received, amplitudes, the, inverse, square, law, determines, the, distance, to, the, source, there, are, some, differences, with, standard, candles, however, gravitational, waves, are, not, emitted, isotropically, but, measuring, the, polarisation, of, the, wave, provides, enough, information, to, determine, the, angle, of, emission, gravitational, wave, detectors, also, have, anisotropic, antenna, patterns, so, the, position, of, the, source, on, the, sky, relative, to, the, detectors, is, needed, to, determine, the, angle, of, reception, generally, if, a, wave, is, detected, by, a, network, of, three, detectors, at, different, locations, the, network, will, measure, enough, information, to, make, these, corrections, and, obtain, the, distance, also, unlike, standard, candles, gravitational, waves, need, no, calibration, against, other, distance, measures, the, measurement, of, distance, does, of, course, require, the, calibration, of, the, gravitational, wave, detectors, but, then, the, distance, is, fundamentally, given, as, a, multiple, of, the, wavelength, of, the, laser, light, being, used, in, the, gravitational, wave, interferometer, there, are, other, considerations, that, limit, the, accuracy, of, this, distance, besides, detector, calibration, fortunately, gravitational, waves, are, not, subject, to, extinction, due, to, an, intervening, absorbing, medium, but, they, are, subject, to, gravitational, lensing, in, the, same, way, as, light, if, a, signal, is, strongly, lensed, then, it, might, be, received, as, multiple, events, separated, in, time, the, analogue, of, multiple, images, of, a, quasar, for, example, less, easy, to, discern, and, control, for, is, the, effect, of, weak, lensing, where, the, signal, s, path, through, space, is, affected, by, many, small, magnification, and, demagnification, events, this, will, be, important, for, signals, originating, at, cosmological, redshifts, greater, than, 1, it, is, difficult, for, detector, networks, to, measure, the, polarization, of, a, signal, accurately, if, the, binary, system, is, observed, nearly, face, on, such, signals, suffer, significantly, larger, errors, in, the, distance, measurement, unfortunately, binaries, radiate, most, strongly, perpendicular, to, the, orbital, plane, so, face, on, signals, are, intrinsically, stronger, and, the, most, commonly, observed, if, the, binary, consists, of, a, pair, of, neutron, stars, their, merger, will, be, accompanied, by, a, kilonova, hypernova, explosion, that, may, allow, the, position, to, be, accurately, identified, by, electromagnetic, telescopes, in, such, cases, the, redshift, of, the, host, galaxy, allows, a, determination, of, the, hubble, constant, h, 0, displaystyle, h, 0, this, was, the, case, for, gw170817, which, was, used, to, make, the, first, such, measurement, even, if, no, electromagnetic, counterpart, can, be, identified, for, an, ensemble, of, signals, it, is, possible, to, use, a, statistical, method, to, infer, the, value, of, h, 0, displaystyle, h, 0, another, class, of, physical, distance, indicator, is, the, standard, ruler, in, 2008, galaxy, diameters, have, been, proposed, as, a, possible, standard, ruler, for, cosmological, parameter, determination, more, recently, the, physical, scale, imprinted, by, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, bao, in, the, early, universe, has, been, used, in, the, early, universe, before, recombination, the, baryons, and, photons, scatter, off, each, other, and, form, a, tightly, coupled, fluid, that, can, support, sound, waves, the, waves, are, sourced, by, primordial, density, perturbations, and, travel, at, speed, that, can, be, predicted, from, the, baryon, density, and, other, cosmological, parameters, the, total, distance, that, these, sound, waves, can, travel, before, recombination, determines, a, fixed, scale, which, simply, expands, with, the, universe, after, recombination, bao, therefore, provide, a, standard, ruler, that, can, be, measured, in, galaxy, surveys, from, the, effect, of, baryons, on, the, clustering, of, galaxies, the, method, requires, an, extensive, galaxy, survey, in, order, to, make, this, scale, visible, but, has, been, measured, with, percent, level, precision, see, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, the, scale, does, depend, on, cosmological, parameters, like, the, baryon, and, matter, densities, and, the, number, of, neutrinos, so, distances, based, on, bao, are, more, dependent, on, cosmological, model, than, those, based, on, local, measurements, light, echos, can, be, also, used, as, standard, rulers, although, it, is, challenging, to, correctly, measure, the, source, geometry, with, few, exceptions, distances, based, on, direct, measurements, are, available, only, out, to, about, a, thousand, parsecs, which, is, a, modest, portion, of, our, own, galaxy, for, distances, beyond, that, measures, depend, upon, physical, assumptions, that, is, the, assertion, that, one, recognizes, the, object, in, question, and, the, class, of, objects, is, homogeneous, enough, that, its, members, can, be, used, for, meaningful, estimation, of, distance, physical, distance, indicators, used, on, progressively, larger, distance, scales, include, when, the, absolute, magnitude, for, a, group, of, stars, is, plotted, against, the, spectral, classification, of, the, star, in, a, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, evolutionary, patterns, are, found, that, relate, to, the, mass, age, and, composition, of, the, star, in, particular, during, their, hydrogen, burning, period, stars, lie, along, a, curve, in, the, diagram, called, the, main, sequence, by, measuring, these, properties, from, a, star, s, spectrum, the, position, of, a, main, sequence, star, on, the, h, r, diagram, can, be, determined, and, thereby, the, star, s, absolute, magnitude, estimated, a, comparison, of, this, value, with, the, apparent, magnitude, allows, the, approximate, distance, to, be, determined, after, correcting, for, interstellar, extinction, of, the, luminosity, because, of, gas, and, dust, in, a, gravitationally, bound, star, cluster, such, as, the, hyades, the, stars, formed, at, approximately, the, same, age, and, lie, at, the, same, distance, this, allows, relatively, accurate, main, sequence, fitting, providing, both, age, and, distance, determination, the, extragalactic, distance, scale, is, a, series, of, techniques, used, today, by, astronomers, to, determine, the, distance, of, cosmological, bodies, beyond, our, own, galaxy, which, are, not, easily, obtained, with, traditional, methods, some, procedures, use, properties, of, these, objects, such, as, stars, globular, clusters, nebulae, and, galaxies, as, a, whole, other, methods, are, based, more, on, the, statistics, and, probabilities, of, things, such, as, entire, galaxy, clusters, discovered, in, 1956, by, olin, wilson, and, m, k, vainu, bappu, the, wilson, bappu, effect, uses, the, effect, known, as, spectroscopic, parallax, many, stars, have, features, in, their, spectra, such, as, the, calcium, k, line, that, indicate, their, absolute, magnitude, the, distance, to, the, star, can, then, be, calculated, from, its, apparent, magnitude, using, the, distance, modulus, there, are, major, limitations, to, this, method, for, finding, stellar, distances, the, calibration, of, the, spectral, line, strengths, has, limited, accuracy, and, it, requires, a, correction, for, interstellar, extinction, though, in, theory, this, method, has, the, ability, to, provide, reliable, distance, calculations, to, stars, up, to, 7, megaparsecs, mpc, it, is, generally, only, used, for, stars, at, hundreds, of, kiloparsecs, kpc, beyond, the, reach, of, the, wilson, bappu, effect, the, next, method, relies, on, the, period, luminosity, relation, of, classical, cepheid, variable, stars, the, following, relation, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, distance, to, galactic, and, extragalactic, classical, cepheids, 5, log, 10, d, v, 3, 34, log, 10, p, 2, 45, v, i, 7, 52, displaystyle, 5, log, 10, d, v, 3, 34, log, 10, p, 2, 45, v, i, 7, 52, 5, log, 10, d, v, 3, 37, log, 10, p, 2, 55, v, i, 7, 48, displaystyle, 5, log, 10, d, v, 3, 37, log, 10, p, 2, 55, v, i, 7, 48, several, problems, complicate, the, use, of, cepheids, as, standard, candles, and, are, actively, debated, chief, among, them, are, the, nature, and, linearity, of, the, period, luminosity, relation, in, various, passbands, and, the, impact, of, metallicity, on, both, the, zero, point, and, slope, of, those, relations, and, the, effects, of, photometric, contamination, blending, and, a, changing, typically, unknown, extinction, law, on, cepheid, distances, these, unresolved, matters, have, resulted, in, cited, values, for, the, hubble, constant, ranging, between, 60, km, s, mpc, and, 80, km, s, mpc, resolving, this, discrepancy, is, one, of, the, foremost, problems, in, astronomy, since, some, cosmological, parameters, of, the, universe, may, be, constrained, significantly, better, by, supplying, a, precise, value, of, the, hubble, constant, cepheid, variable, stars, were, the, key, instrument, in, edwin, hubble, s, 1923, conclusion, that, m31, andromeda, was, an, external, galaxy, as, opposed, to, a, smaller, nebula, within, the, milky, way, he, was, able, to, calculate, the, distance, of, m31, to, 285, kpc, today, s, value, being, 770, kpc, as, detected, thus, far, ngc, 3370, a, spiral, galaxy, in, the, constellation, leo, contains, the, farthest, cepheids, yet, found, at, a, distance, of, 29, mpc, cepheid, variable, stars, are, in, no, way, perfect, distance, markers, at, nearby, galaxies, they, have, an, error, of, about, 7, and, up, to, a, 15, error, for, the, most, distant, there, are, several, different, methods, for, which, supernovae, can, be, used, to, measure, extragalactic, distances, we, can, assume, that, a, supernova, expands, in, a, spherically, symmetric, manner, if, the, supernova, is, close, enough, such, that, we, can, measure, the, angular, extent, t, of, its, photosphere, we, can, use, the, equation, t, displaystyle, omega, frac, delta, theta, delta, t, where, is, angular, velocity, is, angular, extent, in, order, to, get, an, accurate, measurement, it, is, necessary, to, make, two, observations, separated, by, time, t, subsequently, we, can, use, d, v, e, j, displaystyle, d, frac, v, ej, omega, where, d, is, the, distance, to, the, supernova, v, ej, is, the, supernova, s, ejecta, s, radial, velocity, it, can, be, assumed, that, v, ej, equals, v, if, spherically, symmetric, this, method, works, only, if, the, supernova, is, close, enough, to, be, able, to, measure, accurately, the, photosphere, similarly, the, expanding, shell, of, gas, is, in, fact, not, perfectly, spherical, nor, a, perfect, blackbody, also, interstellar, extinction, can, hinder, the, accurate, measurements, of, the, photosphere, this, problem, is, further, exacerbated, by, core, collapse, supernova, all, of, these, factors, contribute, to, the, distance, error, of, up, to, 25, type, ia, supernovae, are, some, of, the, best, ways, to, determine, extragalactic, distances, ia, s, occur, when, a, binary, white, dwarf, star, begins, to, accrete, matter, from, its, companion, star, as, the, white, dwarf, gains, matter, eventually, it, reaches, its, chandrasekhar, limit, of, 1, 4, m, displaystyle, 1, 4m, odot, once, reached, the, star, becomes, unstable, and, undergoes, a, runaway, nuclear, fusion, reaction, because, all, type, ia, supernovae, explode, at, about, the, same, mass, their, absolute, magnitudes, are, all, the, same, this, makes, them, very, useful, as, standard, candles, all, type, ia, supernovae, have, a, standard, blue, and, visual, magnitude, of, m, b, m, v, 19, 3, 0, 3, displaystyle, m, b, approx, m, v, approx, 19, 3, pm, 0, 3, therefore, when, observing, a, type, ia, supernova, if, it, is, possible, to, determine, what, its, peak, magnitude, was, then, its, distance, can, be, calculated, it, is, not, intrinsically, necessary, to, capture, the, supernova, directly, at, its, peak, magnitude, using, the, multicolor, light, curve, shape, method, mlcs, the, shape, of, the, light, curve, taken, at, any, reasonable, time, after, the, initial, explosion, is, compared, to, a, family, of, parameterized, curves, that, will, determine, the, absolute, magnitude, at, the, maximum, brightness, this, method, also, takes, into, effect, interstellar, extinction, dimming, from, dust, and, gas, similarly, the, stretch, method, fits, the, particular, supernovae, magnitude, light, curves, to, a, template, light, curve, this, template, as, opposed, to, being, several, light, curves, at, different, wavelengths, mlcs, is, just, a, single, light, curve, that, has, been, stretched, or, compressed, in, time, by, using, this, stretch, factor, the, peak, magnitude, can, be, determined, using, type, ia, supernovae, is, one, of, the, most, accurate, methods, particularly, since, supernova, explosions, can, be, visible, at, great, distances, their, luminosities, rival, that, of, the, galaxy, in, which, they, are, situated, much, farther, than, cepheid, variables, 500, times, farther, much, time, has, been, devoted, to, the, refining, of, this, method, the, current, uncertainty, approaches, a, mere, 5, corresponding, to, an, uncertainty, of, just, 0, 1, magnitudes, novae, can, be, used, in, much, the, same, way, as, supernovae, to, derive, extragalactic, distances, there, is, a, direct, relation, between, a, nova, s, max, magnitude, and, the, time, for, its, visible, light, to, decline, by, two, magnitudes, this, relation, is, shown, to, be, m, v, max, 9, 96, 2, 31, log, 10, x, displaystyle, m, v, max, 9, 96, 2, 31, log, 10, dot, x, where, x, displaystyle, dot, x, is, the, time, derivative, of, the, nova, s, mag, describing, the, average, rate, of, decline, over, the, first, 2, magnitudes, after, novae, fade, they, are, about, as, bright, as, the, most, luminous, cepheid, variable, stars, therefore, both, these, techniques, have, about, the, same, max, distance, 20, mpc, the, error, in, this, method, produces, an, uncertainty, in, magnitude, of, about, 0, 4, based, on, the, method, of, comparing, the, luminosities, of, globular, clusters, located, in, galactic, halos, from, distant, galaxies, to, that, of, the, virgo, cluster, the, globular, cluster, luminosity, function, carries, an, uncertainty, of, distance, of, about, 20, or, 0, 4, magnitudes, us, astronomer, william, alvin, baum, first, attempted, to, use, globular, clusters, to, measure, distant, elliptical, galaxies, he, compared, the, brightest, globular, clusters, in, virgo, a, galaxy, with, those, in, andromeda, assuming, the, luminosities, of, the, clusters, were, the, same, in, both, knowing, the, distance, to, andromeda, baum, has, assumed, a, direct, correlation, and, estimated, virgo, a, s, distance, baum, used, just, a, single, globular, cluster, but, individual, formations, are, often, poor, standard, candles, canadian, astronomer, ren, racine, assumed, the, use, of, the, globular, cluster, luminosity, function, gclf, would, lead, to, a, better, approximation, the, number, of, globular, clusters, as, a, function, of, magnitude, is, given, by, m, a, e, m, m, 0, 2, 2, 2, displaystyle, phi, m, ae, m, m, 0, 2, 2, sigma, 2, where, m, 0, is, the, turnover, magnitude, m, 0, is, the, magnitude, of, the, virgo, cluster, and, sigma, is, the, dispersion, 1, 4, mag, it, is, assumed, that, globular, clusters, all, have, roughly, the, same, luminosities, within, the, universe, there, is, no, universal, globular, cluster, luminosity, function, that, applies, to, all, galaxies, like, the, gclf, method, a, similar, numerical, analysis, can, be, used, for, planetary, nebulae, within, far, off, galaxies, the, planetary, nebula, luminosity, function, pnlf, was, first, proposed, in, the, late, 1970s, by, holland, cole, and, david, jenner, they, suggested, that, all, planetary, nebulae, might, all, have, similar, maximum, intrinsic, brightness, now, calculated, to, be, m, 4, 53, this, would, therefore, make, them, potential, standard, candles, for, determining, extragalactic, distances, astronomer, george, howard, jacoby, and, his, colleagues, later, proposed, that, the, pnlf, function, equaled, n, m, e, 0, 307, m, 1, e, 3, m, m, displaystyle, n, m, propto, e, 0, 307m, 1, e, 3, m, m, where, n, m, is, number, of, planetary, nebula, having, absolute, magnitude, m, m, is, equal, to, the, nebula, with, the, brightest, magnitude, the, following, method, deals, with, the, overall, inherent, properties, of, galaxies, these, methods, though, with, varying, error, percentages, have, the, ability, to, make, distance, estimates, beyond, 100, mpc, though, it, is, usually, applied, more, locally, the, surface, brightness, fluctuation, sbf, method, takes, advantage, of, the, use, of, ccd, cameras, on, telescopes, because, of, spatial, fluctuations, in, a, galaxy, s, surface, brightness, some, pixels, on, these, cameras, will, pick, up, more, stars, than, others, as, distance, increases, the, picture, will, become, increasingly, smoother, analysis, of, this, describes, a, magnitude, of, the, pixel, to, pixel, variation, which, is, directly, related, to, a, galaxy, s, distance, the, sigma, d, relation, or, d, relation, used, in, elliptical, galaxies, relates, the, angular, diameter, d, of, the, galaxy, to, its, velocity, dispersion, it, is, important, to, describe, exactly, what, d, represents, in, order, to, understand, this, method, it, is, more, precisely, the, galaxy, s, angular, diameter, out, to, the, surface, brightness, level, of, 20, 75, b, mag, arcsec, 2, this, surface, brightness, is, independent, of, the, galaxy, s, actual, distance, from, us, instead, d, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, galaxy, s, distance, represented, as, d, thus, this, relation, does, not, employ, standard, candles, rather, d, provides, a, standard, ruler, this, relation, between, d, and, is, log, d, 1, 333, log, c, displaystyle, log, d, 1, 333, log, sigma, c, where, c, is, a, constant, which, depends, on, the, distance, to, the, galaxy, clusters, this, method, has, the, potential, to, become, one, of, the, strongest, methods, of, galactic, distance, calculators, perhaps, exceeding, the, range, of, even, the, tully, fisher, method, as, of, today, however, elliptical, galaxies, are, not, bright, enough, to, provide, a, calibration, for, this, method, through, the, use, of, techniques, such, as, cepheids, instead, calibration, is, done, using, more, crude, methods, a, succession, of, distance, indicators, which, is, the, distance, ladder, is, needed, for, determining, distances, to, other, galaxies, the, reason, is, that, objects, bright, enough, to, be, recognized, and, measured, at, such, distances, are, so, rare, that, few, or, none, are, present, nearby, so, there, are, too, few, examples, close, enough, with, reliable, trigonometric, parallax, to, calibrate, the, indicator, for, example, cepheid, variables, one, of, the, best, indicators, for, nearby, spiral, galaxies, cannot, yet, be, satisfactorily, calibrated, by, parallax, alone, though, the, gaia, space, mission, can, now, weigh, in, on, that, specific, problem, the, situation, is, further, complicated, by, the, fact, that, different, stellar, populations, generally, do, not, have, all, types, of, stars, in, them, cepheids, in, particular, are, massive, stars, with, short, lifetimes, so, they, will, only, be, found, in, places, where, stars, have, very, recently, been, formed, consequently, because, elliptical, galaxies, usually, have, long, ceased, to, have, large, scale, star, formation, they, will, not, have, cepheids, instead, distance, indicators, whose, origins, are, in, an, older, stellar, population, like, novae, and, rr, lyrae, variables, must, be, used, rr, lyrae, variables, are, less, luminous, than, cepheids, and, novae, are, unpredictable, and, an, intensive, monitoring, program, and, luck, during, that, program, is, needed, to, gather, enough, novae, in, the, target, galaxy, for, a, good, distance, estimate, because, the, more, distant, steps, of, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, depend, upon, the, nearer, ones, the, more, distant, steps, include, the, effects, of, errors, in, the, nearer, steps, both, systematic, and, statistical, ones, the, result, of, these, propagating, errors, means, that, distances, in, astronomy, are, rarely, known, to, the, same, level, of, precision, as, measurements, in, the, other, sciences, and, that, the, precision, necessarily, is, poorer, for, more, distant, types, of, object, another, concern, especially, for, the, very, brightest, standard, candles, is, their, standardness, how, homogeneous, the, objects, are, in, their, true, absolute, magnitude, for, some, of, these, different, standard, candles, the, homogeneity, is, based, on, theories, about, the, formation, and, evolution, of, stars, and, galaxies, and, is, thus, also, subject, to, uncertainties, in, those, aspects, for, the, most, luminous, of, distance, indicators, the, type, ia, supernovae, this, homogeneity, is, known, to, be, poor, however, no, other, class, of, object, is, bright, enough, to, be, detected, at, such, large, distances, so, the, class, is, useful, simply, because, there, is, no, real, alternative, the, observational, result, of, hubble, s, law, the, proportional, relationship, between, distance, and, the, speed, with, which, a, galaxy, is, moving, away, from, us, usually, referred, to, as, redshift, is, a, product, of, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, edwin, hubble, observed, that, fainter, galaxies, are, more, redshifted, finding, the, value, of, the, hubble, constant, was, the, result, of, decades, of, work, by, many, astronomers, both, in, amassing, the, measurements, of, galaxy, redshifts, and, in, calibrating, the, steps, of, the, distance, ladder, hubble, s, law, is, the, primary, means, we, have, for, estimating, the, distances, of, quasars, and, distant, galaxies, in, which, individual, distance, indicators, cannot, be, seen
