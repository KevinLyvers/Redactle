the, mesozoic, era, is, the, era, of, earth, s, geological, history, lasting, from, about, 252, to, 66, million, years, ago, comprising, the, triassic, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, it, is, characterized, by, the, dominance, of, gymnosperms, and, of, archosaurian, reptiles, such, as, the, dinosaurs, a, hot, greenhouse, climate, and, the, tectonic, break, up, of, pangaea, the, mesozoic, is, the, middle, of, the, three, eras, since, complex, life, evolved, the, paleozoic, the, mesozoic, and, the, cenozoic, the, era, began, in, the, wake, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, largest, mass, extinction, in, earth, s, history, and, ended, with, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, another, mass, extinction, whose, victims, included, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, mosasaurs, and, plesiosaurs, the, mesozoic, was, a, time, of, significant, tectonic, climatic, and, evolutionary, activity, the, supercontinent, pangaea, began, to, break, apart, into, separate, landmasses, the, climate, of, the, mesozoic, was, varied, alternating, between, warming, and, cooling, periods, overall, however, the, earth, was, hotter, than, it, is, today, dinosaurs, first, appeared, in, the, mid, triassic, and, became, the, dominant, terrestrial, vertebrates, in, the, late, triassic, or, early, jurassic, occupying, this, position, for, about, 150, or, 135, million, years, until, their, demise, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, archaic, birds, appeared, in, the, jurassic, having, evolved, from, a, branch, of, theropod, dinosaurs, then, true, toothless, birds, appeared, in, the, cretaceous, the, first, mammals, also, appeared, during, the, mesozoic, but, would, remain, small, less, than, 15, kg, 33, lb, until, the, cenozoic, flowering, plants, appeared, in, the, early, cretaceous, and, would, rapidly, diversify, through, the, end, of, the, era, replacing, conifers, and, other, gymnosperms, sensu, lato, like, ginkgoales, cycads, and, bennettitales, as, the, dominant, group, of, plants, the, phrase, age, of, reptiles, was, introduced, by, the, 19th, century, paleontologist, gideon, mantell, who, viewed, it, as, dominated, by, diapsids, such, as, iguanodon, megalosaurus, plesiosaurus, and, pterodactylus, the, current, name, was, proposed, in, 1840, by, the, british, geologist, john, phillips, 1800, 1874, mesozoic, literally, means, middle, life, deriving, from, the, greek, prefix, meso, between, and, z, on, animal, living, being, in, this, way, the, mesozoic, is, comparable, to, the, cenozoic, lit, new, life, and, paleozoic, old, life, eras, as, well, as, the, proterozoic, earlier, life, eon, the, mesozoic, era, was, originally, described, as, the, secondary, era, following, the, primary, paleozoic, and, preceding, the, tertiary, following, the, paleozoic, the, mesozoic, extended, roughly, 186, million, years, from, 251, 902, to, 66, million, years, ago, when, the, cenozoic, era, began, this, time, frame, is, separated, into, three, geologic, periods, from, oldest, to, youngest, the, lower, boundary, of, the, mesozoic, is, set, by, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, during, which, it, has, been, estimated, that, up, to, 90, 96, of, marine, species, became, extinct, although, those, approximations, have, been, brought, into, question, with, some, paleontologists, estimating, the, actual, numbers, as, low, as, 81, it, is, also, known, as, the, great, dying, because, it, is, considered, the, largest, mass, extinction, in, the, earth, s, history, the, upper, boundary, of, the, mesozoic, is, set, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, or, k, pg, extinction, event, which, may, have, been, caused, by, an, asteroid, impactor, that, created, chicxulub, crater, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, towards, the, late, cretaceous, large, volcanic, eruptions, are, also, believed, to, have, contributed, to, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, approximately, 50, of, all, genera, became, extinct, including, all, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, the, triassic, ranges, roughly, from, 252, million, to, 201, million, years, ago, preceding, the, jurassic, period, the, period, is, bracketed, between, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, and, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, two, of, the, big, five, and, it, is, divided, into, three, major, epochs, early, middle, and, late, triassic, the, early, triassic, about, 252, to, 247, million, years, ago, was, dominated, by, deserts, in, the, interior, of, the, pangaea, supercontinent, the, earth, had, just, witnessed, a, massive, die, off, in, which, 95, of, all, life, became, extinct, and, the, most, common, vertebrate, life, on, land, were, lystrosaurus, labyrinthodonts, and, euparkeria, along, with, many, other, creatures, that, managed, to, survive, the, permian, extinction, temnospondyls, reached, peak, diversity, during, the, early, triassic, the, middle, triassic, from, 247, to, 237, million, years, ago, featured, the, beginnings, of, the, breakup, of, pangaea, and, the, opening, of, the, tethys, ocean, ecosystems, had, recovered, from, the, permian, extinction, algae, sponge, corals, and, crustaceans, all, had, recovered, and, new, aquatic, reptiles, evolved, such, as, ichthyosaurs, and, nothosaurs, on, land, pine, forests, flourished, as, did, groups, of, insects, like, mosquitoes, and, fruit, flies, reptiles, began, to, get, bigger, and, bigger, and, the, first, crocodilians, and, dinosaurs, evolved, which, sparked, competition, with, the, large, amphibians, that, had, previously, ruled, the, freshwater, world, respectively, mammal, like, reptiles, on, land, following, the, bloom, of, the, middle, triassic, the, late, triassic, from, 237, to, 201, million, years, ago, featured, frequent, heat, spells, and, moderate, precipitation, 10, 20, inches, per, year, the, recent, warming, led, to, a, boom, of, dinosaurian, evolution, on, land, as, the, continents, began, to, separate, from, each, other, nyasasaurus, from, 243, to, 210, million, years, ago, approximately, 235, 30, ma, some, of, them, separated, into, sauropodomorphs, theropods, and, herrerasaurids, as, well, as, the, first, pterosaurs, during, the, late, triassic, some, advanced, cynodonts, gave, rise, to, the, first, mammaliaformes, all, this, climatic, change, however, resulted, in, a, large, die, out, known, as, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, in, which, many, archosaurs, excluding, pterosaurs, dinosaurs, and, crocodylomorphs, most, synapsids, and, almost, all, large, amphibians, became, extinct, as, well, as, 34, of, marine, life, in, the, earth, s, fourth, mass, extinction, event, the, cause, is, debatable, flood, basalt, eruptions, at, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, is, cited, as, one, possible, cause, the, jurassic, ranges, from, 200, million, years, to, 145, million, years, ago, and, features, three, major, epochs, the, early, jurassic, the, middle, jurassic, and, the, late, jurassic, the, early, jurassic, spans, from, 200, to, 175, million, years, ago, the, climate, was, tropical, and, much, more, humid, than, the, triassic, as, a, result, of, the, large, seas, appearing, between, the, land, masses, in, the, oceans, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and, ammonites, were, abundant, on, land, dinosaurs, and, other, archosaurs, staked, their, claim, as, the, dominant, race, with, theropods, such, as, dilophosaurus, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, the, first, true, crocodiles, evolved, pushing, the, large, amphibians, to, near, extinction, all, in, all, archosaurs, rose, to, rule, the, world, meanwhile, the, first, true, mammals, evolved, remaining, relatively, small, but, spreading, widely, the, jurassic, castorocauda, for, example, had, adaptations, for, swimming, digging, and, catching, fish, fruitafossor, from, the, late, jurassic, period, about, 150, million, years, ago, was, about, the, size, of, a, chipmunk, and, its, teeth, forelimbs, and, back, suggest, that, it, dug, open, the, nests, of, social, insects, probably, termites, as, ants, had, not, yet, appeared, volaticotherium, was, able, to, glide, for, short, distances, like, modern, flying, squirrels, the, first, multituberculates, like, rugosodon, evolved, the, middle, jurassic, spans, from, 175, to, 163, million, years, ago, during, this, epoch, dinosaurs, flourished, as, huge, herds, of, sauropods, such, as, brachiosaurus, and, diplodocus, filled, the, fern, prairies, chased, by, many, new, predators, such, as, allosaurus, conifer, forests, made, up, a, large, portion, of, the, forests, in, the, oceans, plesiosaurs, were, quite, common, and, ichthyosaurs, flourished, this, epoch, was, the, peak, of, the, reptiles, the, late, jurassic, spans, from, 163, to, 145, million, years, ago, during, this, epoch, the, first, avialans, like, archaeopteryx, evolved, from, small, coelurosaurian, dinosaurs, the, increase, in, sea, levels, opened, up, the, atlantic, seaway, which, has, grown, continually, larger, until, today, the, further, separation, of, the, continents, gave, opportunity, for, the, diversification, of, new, dinosaurs, the, cretaceous, is, the, longest, period, of, the, mesozoic, but, has, only, two, epochs, early, and, late, cretaceous, the, early, cretaceous, spans, from, 145, to, 100, million, years, ago, the, early, cretaceous, saw, the, expansion, of, seaways, and, a, decline, in, diversity, of, sauropods, stegosaurs, and, other, high, browsing, groups, with, sauropods, particularly, scarce, in, north, america, some, island, hopping, dinosaurs, like, eustreptospondylus, evolved, to, cope, with, the, coastal, shallows, and, small, islands, of, ancient, europe, other, dinosaurs, rose, up, to, fill, the, empty, space, that, the, jurassic, cretaceous, extinction, left, behind, such, as, carcharodontosaurus, and, spinosaurus, seasons, came, back, into, effect, and, the, poles, got, seasonally, colder, but, some, dinosaurs, still, inhabited, the, polar, forests, year, round, such, as, leaellynasaura, and, muttaburrasaurus, the, poles, were, too, cold, for, crocodiles, and, became, the, last, stronghold, for, large, amphibians, like, koolasuchus, pterosaurs, got, larger, as, genera, like, tapejara, and, ornithocheirus, evolved, mammals, continued, to, expand, their, range, eutriconodonts, produced, fairly, large, wolverine, like, predators, like, repenomamus, and, gobiconodon, early, therians, began, to, expand, into, metatherians, and, eutherians, and, cimolodont, multituberculates, went, on, to, become, common, in, the, fossil, record, the, late, cretaceous, spans, from, 100, to, 66, million, years, ago, the, late, cretaceous, featured, a, cooling, trend, that, would, continue, in, the, cenozoic, era, eventually, tropics, were, restricted, to, the, equator, and, areas, beyond, the, tropic, lines, experienced, extreme, seasonal, changes, in, weather, dinosaurs, still, thrived, as, new, taxa, such, as, tyrannosaurus, ankylosaurus, triceratops, and, hadrosaurs, dominated, the, food, web, in, the, oceans, mosasaurs, ruled, filling, the, role, of, the, ichthyosaurs, which, after, declining, had, disappeared, in, the, cenomanian, turonian, boundary, event, though, pliosaurs, had, gone, extinct, in, the, same, event, long, necked, plesiosaurs, such, as, elasmosaurus, continued, to, thrive, flowering, plants, possibly, appearing, as, far, back, as, the, triassic, became, truly, dominant, for, the, first, time, pterosaurs, in, the, late, cretaceous, declined, for, poorly, understood, reasons, though, this, might, be, due, to, tendencies, of, the, fossil, record, as, their, diversity, seems, to, be, much, higher, than, previously, thought, birds, became, increasingly, common, and, diversified, into, a, variety, of, enantiornithe, and, ornithurine, forms, though, mostly, small, marine, hesperornithes, became, relatively, large, and, flightless, adapted, to, life, in, the, open, sea, metatherians, and, primitive, eutherian, also, became, common, and, even, produced, large, and, specialised, genera, like, didelphodon, and, schowalteria, still, the, dominant, mammals, were, multituberculates, cimolodonts, in, the, north, and, gondwanatheres, in, the, south, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, deccan, traps, and, other, volcanic, eruptions, were, poisoning, the, atmosphere, as, this, continued, it, is, thought, that, a, large, meteor, smashed, into, earth, 66, million, years, ago, creating, the, chicxulub, crater, in, an, event, known, as, the, k, pg, extinction, formerly, k, t, the, fifth, and, most, recent, mass, extinction, event, in, which, 75, of, life, became, extinct, including, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, compared, to, the, vigorous, convergent, plate, mountain, building, of, the, late, paleozoic, mesozoic, tectonic, deformation, was, comparatively, mild, the, sole, major, mesozoic, orogeny, occurred, in, what, is, now, the, arctic, creating, the, innuitian, orogeny, the, brooks, range, the, verkhoyansk, and, cherskiy, ranges, in, siberia, and, the, khingan, mountains, in, manchuria, this, orogeny, was, related, to, the, opening, of, the, arctic, ocean, and, suturing, of, the, north, china, and, siberian, cratons, to, asia, in, contrast, the, era, featured, the, dramatic, rifting, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, which, gradually, split, into, a, northern, continent, laurasia, and, a, southern, continent, gondwana, this, created, the, passive, continental, margin, that, characterizes, most, of, the, atlantic, coastline, such, as, along, the, u, s, east, coast, today, by, the, end, of, the, era, the, continents, had, rifted, into, nearly, their, present, forms, though, not, their, present, positions, laurasia, became, north, america, and, eurasia, while, gondwana, split, into, south, america, africa, australia, antarctica, and, the, indian, subcontinent, which, collided, with, the, asian, plate, during, the, cenozoic, giving, rise, to, the, himalayas, the, triassic, was, generally, dry, a, trend, that, began, in, the, late, carboniferous, and, highly, seasonal, especially, in, the, interior, of, pangaea, low, sea, levels, may, have, also, exacerbated, temperature, extremes, with, its, high, specific, heat, capacity, water, acts, as, a, temperature, stabilizing, heat, reservoir, and, land, areas, near, large, bodies, of, water, especially, oceans, experience, less, variation, in, temperature, because, much, of, pangaea, s, land, was, distant, from, its, shores, temperatures, fluctuated, greatly, and, the, interior, probably, included, expansive, deserts, abundant, red, beds, and, evaporites, such, as, halite, support, these, conclusions, but, some, evidence, suggests, the, generally, dry, climate, of, the, triassic, was, punctuated, by, episodes, of, increased, rainfall, the, most, important, humid, episodes, were, the, carnian, pluvial, event, and, one, in, the, rhaetian, a, few, million, years, before, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, sea, levels, began, to, rise, during, the, jurassic, probably, caused, by, an, increase, in, seafloor, spreading, the, formation, of, new, crust, beneath, the, surface, displaced, ocean, waters, by, as, much, as, 200, m, 656, ft, above, today, s, sea, level, flooding, coastal, areas, furthermore, pangaea, began, to, rift, into, smaller, divisions, creating, new, shoreline, around, the, tethys, ocean, temperatures, continued, to, increase, then, began, to, stabilize, humidity, also, increased, with, the, proximity, of, water, and, deserts, retreated, the, climate, of, the, cretaceous, is, less, certain, and, more, widely, disputed, probably, higher, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, are, thought, to, have, almost, eliminated, the, north, south, temperature, gradient, temperatures, were, about, the, same, across, the, planet, and, about, 10, c, higher, than, today, the, circulation, of, oxygen, to, the, deep, ocean, may, also, have, been, disrupted, preventing, the, decomposition, of, large, volumes, of, organic, matter, which, was, eventually, deposited, as, black, shale, different, studies, have, come, to, different, conclusions, about, the, amount, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, during, different, parts, of, the, mesozoic, with, some, concluding, oxygen, levels, were, lower, than, the, current, level, about, 21, throughout, the, mesozoic, some, concluding, they, were, lower, in, the, triassic, and, part, of, the, jurassic, but, higher, in, the, cretaceous, and, some, concluding, they, were, higher, throughout, most, or, all, of, the, triassic, jurassic, and, cretaceous, the, dominant, land, plant, species, of, the, time, were, gymnosperms, which, are, vascular, cone, bearing, non, flowering, plants, such, as, conifers, that, produce, seeds, without, a, coating, this, contrasts, with, the, earth, s, current, flora, in, which, the, dominant, land, plants, in, terms, of, number, of, species, are, angiosperms, the, earliest, members, of, the, genus, ginkgo, first, appeared, during, the, middle, jurassic, this, genus, is, represented, today, by, a, single, species, ginkgo, biloba, modern, conifer, groups, began, to, radiate, during, the, jurassic, bennettitales, an, extinct, group, of, gymnosperms, with, foliage, superficially, resembling, that, of, cycads, gained, a, global, distribution, during, the, late, triassic, and, represented, one, of, the, most, common, groups, of, mesozoic, seed, plants, flowering, plants, radiated, during, the, early, cretaceous, first, in, the, tropics, but, the, even, temperature, gradient, allowed, them, to, spread, toward, the, poles, throughout, the, period, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, angiosperms, dominated, tree, floras, in, many, areas, although, some, evidence, suggests, that, biomass, was, still, dominated, by, cycads, and, ferns, until, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, some, plant, species, had, distributions, that, were, markedly, different, from, succeeding, periods, for, example, the, schizeales, a, fern, order, were, skewed, to, the, northern, hemisphere, in, the, mesozoic, but, are, now, better, represented, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, extinction, of, nearly, all, animal, species, at, the, end, of, the, permian, period, allowed, for, the, radiation, of, many, new, lifeforms, in, particular, the, extinction, of, the, large, herbivorous, pareiasaurs, and, carnivorous, gorgonopsians, left, those, ecological, niches, empty, some, were, filled, by, the, surviving, cynodonts, and, dicynodonts, the, latter, of, which, subsequently, became, extinct, recent, research, indicates, that, it, took, much, longer, for, the, reestablishment, of, complex, ecosystems, with, high, biodiversity, complex, food, webs, and, specialized, animals, in, a, variety, of, niches, beginning, in, the, mid, triassic, 4, million, to, 6, million, years, after, the, extinction, and, not, fully, proliferated, until, 30, million, years, after, the, extinction, animal, life, was, then, dominated, by, various, archosaurs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, aquatic, reptiles, such, as, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and, mosasaurs, the, climatic, changes, of, the, late, jurassic, and, cretaceous, favored, further, adaptive, radiation, the, jurassic, was, the, height, of, archosaur, diversity, and, the, first, birds, and, eutherian, mammals, also, appeared, some, have, argued, that, insects, diversified, in, symbiosis, with, angiosperms, because, insect, anatomy, especially, the, mouth, parts, seems, particularly, well, suited, for, flowering, plants, however, all, major, insect, mouth, parts, preceded, angiosperms, and, insect, diversification, actually, slowed, when, they, arrived, so, their, anatomy, originally, must, have, been, suited, for, some, other, purpose, at, the, dawn, of, the, mesozoic, ocean, plankton, communities, transitioned, from, ones, dominated, by, green, archaeplastidans, to, ones, dominated, by, endosymbiotic, algae, with, red, algal, derived, plastids, this, transition, is, speculated, to, have, been, caused, by, an, increasing, paucity, of, many, trace, metals, in, the, mesozoic, ocean
