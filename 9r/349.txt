graphite, r, f, a, t, is, a, crystalline, allotrope, form, of, the, element, carbon, it, consists, of, many, stacked, layers, of, graphene, typically, in, the, excess, of, hundred, s, of, layers, graphite, occurs, naturally, and, is, the, most, stable, form, of, carbon, under, standard, conditions, synthetic, and, natural, graphite, are, consumed, on, a, large, scale, 1, 3, million, metric, tons, per, year, in, 2022, for, uses, in, many, critical, industries, including, refractories, 50, lithium, ion, batteries, 18, foundries, 10, lubricants, 5, among, others, 17, under, extremely, high, pressures, and, extremely, high, temperatures, it, converts, to, diamond, it, is, a, good, conductor, of, both, heat, graphite, occurs, naturally, in, ores, that, can, be, classified, into, one, of, two, categories, either, amorphous, microcrystalline, or, crystalline, flake, or, lump, chip, which, is, determined, by, the, ore, morphology, crystallinity, and, grain, size, all, naturally, occurring, graphite, deposits, are, formed, from, the, metamorphism, of, carbonaceous, sedimentary, rocks, and, the, ore, type, is, due, to, its, geologic, setting, coal, that, has, been, thermally, metamorphosed, is, the, typical, source, of, amorphous, graphite, crystalline, flake, graphite, is, mined, from, carbonaceous, metamorphic, rocks, while, lump, or, chip, graphite, is, mined, from, veins, which, occur, in, high, grade, metamorphic, regions, there, are, serious, negative, environmental, impacts, to, graphite, mining, synthetic, graphite, is, graphite, of, high, purity, produced, by, thermal, graphitization, at, temperatures, in, excess, of, 2, 100, c, from, hydrocarbon, materials, most, commonly, by, a, process, known, as, the, acheson, process, the, high, temperatures, are, maintained, for, weeks, and, are, required, not, only, to, form, the, graphite, from, the, precursor, carbons, but, to, also, vaporize, any, impurities, that, may, be, present, including, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, organics, and, metals, this, is, why, synthetic, graphite, is, highly, pure, in, excess, of, 99, 9, c, purity, but, typically, has, lower, density, conductivity, and, a, higher, porosity, than, its, natural, equivalent, synthetic, graphite, can, also, be, formed, into, very, large, flakes, cm, while, maintaining, its, high, purity, unlike, almost, all, sources, of, natural, graphite, synthetic, graphite, has, also, been, known, to, be, formed, by, other, methods, including, by, chemical, vapor, deposition, from, hydrocarbons, at, temperatures, above, 2, 500, k, 2, 230, c, by, decomposition, of, thermally, unstable, carbides, or, by, crystallizing, from, metal, melts, supersaturated, with, carbon, biographite, is, a, commercial, product, proposal, for, reducing, the, carbon, footprint, of, lithium, iron, phosphate, lfp, batteries, it, is, produced, from, forestry, waste, and, similar, byproducts, by, a, company, in, new, zealand, using, a, novel, process, called, thermo, catalytic, graphitisation, which, project, is, supported, by, grants, from, interested, parties, including, a, forestry, company, in, finland, and, a, battery, maker, in, hong, kong, graphite, occurs, in, metamorphic, rocks, as, a, result, of, the, reduction, of, sedimentary, carbon, compounds, during, metamorphism, it, also, occurs, in, igneous, rocks, and, in, meteorites, minerals, associated, with, graphite, include, quartz, calcite, micas, and, tourmaline, the, principal, export, sources, of, mined, graphite, are, in, order, of, tonnage, china, mexico, canada, brazil, and, madagascar, significant, unexploited, graphite, resources, also, exists, in, colombia, s, cordillera, central, in, the, form, of, graphite, bearing, schists, in, meteorites, graphite, occurs, with, troilite, and, silicate, minerals, small, graphitic, crystals, in, meteoritic, iron, are, called, cliftonite, some, microscopic, grains, have, distinctive, isotopic, compositions, indicating, that, they, were, formed, before, the, solar, system, they, are, one, of, about, 12, known, types, of, minerals, that, predate, the, solar, system, and, have, also, been, detected, in, molecular, clouds, these, minerals, were, formed, in, the, ejecta, when, supernovae, exploded, or, low, to, intermediate, sized, stars, expelled, their, outer, envelopes, late, in, their, lives, graphite, may, be, the, second, or, third, oldest, mineral, in, the, universe, graphite, consists, of, sheets, of, trigonal, planar, carbon, the, individual, layers, are, called, graphene, in, each, layer, each, carbon, atom, is, bonded, to, three, other, atoms, forming, a, continuous, layer, of, sp, 2, bonded, carbon, hexagons, like, a, honeycomb, lattice, with, a, bond, length, of, 0, 142, nm, and, the, distance, between, planes, is, 0, 335, nm, bonding, between, layers, is, relatively, weak, van, der, waals, bonds, which, allows, the, graphene, like, layers, to, be, easily, separated, and, to, glide, past, each, other, electrical, conductivity, perpendicular, to, the, layers, is, consequently, about, 1000, times, lower, there, are, two, allotropic, forms, called, alpha, hexagonal, and, beta, rhombohedral, differing, in, terms, of, the, stacking, of, the, graphene, layers, stacking, in, alpha, graphite, is, aba, as, opposed, to, abc, stacking, in, the, energetically, less, stable, beta, graphite, rhombohedral, graphite, cannot, occur, in, pure, form, natural, graphite, or, commercial, natural, graphite, contains, 5, to, 15, rhombohedral, graphite, and, this, may, be, due, to, intensive, milling, the, alpha, form, can, be, converted, to, the, beta, form, through, shear, forces, and, the, beta, form, reverts, to, the, alpha, form, when, it, is, heated, to, 1300, c, for, four, hours, the, equilibrium, pressure, and, temperature, conditions, for, a, transition, between, graphite, and, diamond, is, well, established, theoretically, and, experimentally, the, pressure, changes, linearly, between, 1, 7, gpa, at, 0, k, and, 12, gpa, at, 5000, k, the, diamond, graphite, liquid, triple, point, however, the, phases, have, a, wide, region, about, this, line, where, they, can, coexist, at, normal, temperature, and, pressure, 20, c, 293, k, and, 1, standard, atmosphere, 0, 10, mpa, the, stable, phase, of, carbon, is, graphite, but, diamond, is, metastable, and, its, rate, of, conversion, to, graphite, is, negligible, however, at, temperatures, above, about, 4500, k, diamond, rapidly, converts, to, graphite, rapid, conversion, of, graphite, to, diamond, requires, pressures, well, above, the, equilibrium, line, at, 2000, k, a, pressure, of, 35, gpa, is, needed, the, acoustic, and, thermal, properties, of, graphite, are, highly, anisotropic, since, phonons, propagate, quickly, along, the, tightly, bound, planes, but, are, slower, to, travel, from, one, plane, to, another, graphite, s, high, thermal, stability, and, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, facilitate, its, widespread, use, as, electrodes, and, refractories, in, high, temperature, material, processing, applications, however, in, oxygen, containing, atmospheres, graphite, readily, oxidizes, to, form, carbon, dioxide, at, temperatures, of, 700, c, and, above, graphite, is, an, electrical, conductor, hence, useful, in, such, applications, as, arc, lamp, electrodes, it, can, conduct, electricity, due, to, the, vast, electron, delocalization, within, the, carbon, layers, a, phenomenon, called, aromaticity, these, valence, electrons, are, free, to, move, so, are, able, to, conduct, electricity, however, the, electricity, is, primarily, conducted, within, the, plane, of, the, layers, the, conductive, properties, of, powdered, graphite, allow, its, use, as, pressure, sensor, in, carbon, microphones, graphite, and, graphite, powder, are, valued, in, industrial, applications, for, their, self, lubricating, and, dry, lubricating, properties, however, the, use, of, graphite, is, limited, by, its, tendency, to, facilitate, pitting, corrosion, in, some, stainless, steel, and, to, promote, galvanic, corrosion, between, dissimilar, metals, due, to, its, electrical, conductivity, it, is, also, corrosive, to, aluminium, in, the, presence, of, moisture, for, this, reason, the, us, air, force, banned, its, use, as, a, lubricant, in, aluminium, aircraft, and, discouraged, its, use, in, aluminium, containing, automatic, weapons, even, graphite, pencil, marks, on, aluminium, parts, may, facilitate, corrosion, another, high, temperature, lubricant, hexagonal, boron, nitride, has, the, same, molecular, structure, as, graphite, it, is, sometimes, called, white, graphite, due, to, its, similar, properties, when, a, large, number, of, crystallographic, defects, bind, these, planes, together, graphite, loses, its, lubrication, properties, and, becomes, what, is, known, as, pyrolytic, graphite, it, is, also, highly, anisotropic, and, diamagnetic, thus, it, will, float, in, mid, air, above, a, strong, magnet, if, it, is, made, in, a, fluidized, bed, at, 1000, 1300, c, then, it, is, isotropic, turbostratic, and, is, used, in, blood, contacting, devices, like, mechanical, heart, valves, and, is, called, pyrolytic, carbon, and, is, not, diamagnetic, pyrolytic, graphite, and, pyrolytic, carbon, are, often, confused, but, are, very, different, materials, natural, and, crystalline, graphites, are, not, often, used, in, pure, form, as, structural, materials, due, to, their, shear, planes, brittleness, and, inconsistent, mechanical, properties, in, the, 4th, millennium, bce, during, the, neolithic, age, in, southeastern, europe, the, mari, a, culture, used, graphite, in, a, ceramic, paint, for, decorating, pottery, sometime, before, 1565, some, sources, say, as, early, as, 1500, an, enormous, deposit, of, graphite, was, discovered, on, the, approach, to, grey, knotts, from, the, hamlet, of, seathwaite, in, borrowdale, parish, cumbria, england, which, the, locals, found, useful, for, marking, sheep, during, the, reign, of, elizabeth, i, 1558, 1603, borrowdale, graphite, was, used, as, a, refractory, material, to, line, molds, for, cannonballs, resulting, in, rounder, smoother, balls, that, could, be, fired, farther, contributing, to, the, strength, of, the, english, navy, this, particular, deposit, of, graphite, was, extremely, pure, and, soft, and, could, easily, be, cut, into, sticks, because, of, its, military, importance, this, unique, mine, and, its, production, were, strictly, controlled, by, the, crown, during, the, 19th, century, graphite, s, uses, greatly, expanded, to, include, stove, polish, lubricants, paints, crucibles, foundry, facings, and, pencils, a, major, factor, in, the, expansion, of, educational, tools, during, the, first, great, rise, of, education, for, the, masses, the, british, empire, controlled, most, of, the, world, s, production, especially, from, ceylon, but, production, from, austrian, german, and, american, deposits, expanded, by, mid, century, for, example, the, dixon, crucible, company, of, jersey, city, new, jersey, founded, by, joseph, dixon, and, partner, orestes, cleveland, in, 1845, opened, mines, in, the, lake, ticonderoga, district, of, new, york, built, a, processing, plant, there, and, a, factory, to, manufacture, pencils, crucibles, and, other, products, in, new, jersey, described, in, the, engineering, mining, journal, 21, december, 1878, the, dixon, pencil, is, still, in, production, the, beginnings, of, the, revolutionary, froth, flotation, process, are, associated, with, graphite, mining, included, in, the, e, mj, article, on, the, dixon, crucible, company, is, a, sketch, of, the, floating, tanks, used, in, the, age, old, process, of, extracting, graphite, because, graphite, is, so, light, the, mix, of, graphite, and, waste, was, sent, through, a, final, series, of, water, tanks, where, a, cleaner, graphite, floated, off, which, left, waste, to, drop, out, in, an, 1877, patent, the, two, brothers, bessel, adolph, and, august, of, dresden, germany, took, this, floating, process, a, step, further, and, added, a, small, amount, of, oil, to, the, tanks, and, boiled, the, mix, an, agitation, or, frothing, step, to, collect, the, graphite, the, first, steps, toward, the, future, flotation, process, adolph, bessel, received, the, wohler, medal, for, the, patented, process, that, upgraded, the, recovery, of, graphite, to, 90, from, the, german, deposit, in, 1977, the, german, society, of, mining, engineers, and, metallurgists, organized, a, special, symposium, dedicated, to, their, discovery, and, thus, the, 100th, anniversary, of, flotation, in, the, united, states, in, 1885, hezekiah, bradford, of, philadelphia, patented, a, similar, process, but, it, is, uncertain, if, his, process, was, used, successfully, in, the, nearby, graphite, deposits, of, chester, county, pennsylvania, a, major, producer, by, the, 1890s, the, bessel, process, was, limited, in, use, primarily, because, of, the, abundant, cleaner, deposits, found, around, the, globe, which, needed, not, much, more, than, hand, sorting, to, gather, the, pure, graphite, the, state, of, the, art, c, 1900, is, described, in, the, canadian, department, of, mines, report, on, graphite, mines, and, mining, when, canadian, deposits, began, to, become, important, producers, of, graphite, historically, graphite, was, called, black, lead, or, plumbago, plumbago, was, commonly, used, in, its, massive, mineral, form, both, of, these, names, arise, from, confusion, with, the, similar, appearing, lead, ores, particularly, galena, the, latin, word, for, lead, plumbum, gave, its, name, to, the, english, term, for, this, grey, metallic, sheened, mineral, and, even, to, the, leadworts, or, plumbagos, plants, with, flowers, that, resemble, this, colour, the, term, black, lead, usually, refers, to, a, powdered, or, processed, graphite, matte, black, in, color, abraham, gottlob, werner, coined, the, name, graphite, writing, stone, in, 1789, he, attempted, to, clear, up, the, confusion, between, molybdena, plumbago, and, black, lead, after, carl, wilhelm, scheele, in, 1778, proved, that, these, were, at, least, three, different, minerals, scheele, s, analysis, showed, that, the, chemical, compounds, molybdenum, sulfide, molybdenite, lead, ii, sulfide, galena, and, graphite, were, three, different, soft, black, minerals, natural, graphite, is, mostly, used, for, refractories, batteries, steelmaking, expanded, graphite, brake, linings, foundry, facings, and, lubricants, the, use, of, graphite, as, a, refractory, heat, resistant, material, began, before, 1900, with, graphite, crucibles, used, to, hold, molten, metal, this, is, now, a, minor, part, of, refractories, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, carbon, magnesite, brick, became, important, and, a, bit, later, the, alumina, graphite, shape, as, of, 2017, the, order, of, importance, is, alumina, graphite, shapes, carbon, magnesite, brick, monolithics, gunning, and, ramming, mixes, and, then, crucibles, crucibles, began, using, very, large, flake, graphite, and, carbon, magnesite, bricks, requiring, not, quite, so, large, flake, graphite, for, these, and, others, there, is, now, much, more, flexibility, in, the, size, of, flake, required, and, amorphous, graphite, is, no, longer, restricted, to, low, end, refractories, alumina, graphite, shapes, are, used, as, continuous, casting, ware, such, as, nozzles, and, troughs, to, convey, the, molten, steel, from, ladle, to, mold, and, carbon, magnesite, bricks, line, steel, converters, and, electric, arc, furnaces, to, withstand, extreme, temperatures, graphite, blocks, are, also, used, in, parts, of, blast, furnace, linings, where, the, high, thermal, conductivity, of, the, graphite, is, critical, to, ensuring, adequate, cooling, of, the, bottom, and, hearth, of, the, furnace, high, purity, monolithics, are, often, used, as, a, continuous, furnace, lining, instead, of, carbon, magnesite, bricks, the, us, and, european, refractories, industry, had, a, crisis, in, 2000, 2003, with, an, indifferent, market, for, steel, and, a, declining, refractory, consumption, per, tonne, of, steel, underlying, firm, buyouts, and, many, plant, closures, many, of, the, plant, closures, resulted, from, the, acquisition, of, harbison, walker, refractories, by, rhi, ag, and, some, plants, had, their, equipment, auctioned, off, since, much, of, the, lost, capacity, was, for, carbon, magnesite, brick, graphite, consumption, within, the, refractories, area, moved, towards, alumina, graphite, shapes, and, monolithics, and, away, from, the, brick, the, major, source, of, carbon, magnesite, brick, is, now, china, almost, all, of, the, above, refractories, are, used, to, make, steel, and, account, for, 75, of, refractory, consumption, the, rest, is, used, by, a, variety, of, industries, such, as, cement, according, to, the, usgs, us, natural, graphite, consumption, in, refractories, comprised, 12, 500, tonnes, in, 2010, the, use, of, graphite, in, batteries, has, increased, since, the, 1970s, natural, and, synthetic, graphite, are, used, as, an, anode, material, to, construct, electrodes, in, major, battery, technologies, the, demand, for, batteries, primarily, nickel, metal, hydride, and, lithium, ion, batteries, caused, a, growth, in, demand, for, graphite, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, a, growth, driven, by, portable, electronics, such, as, portable, cd, players, and, power, tools, laptops, mobile, phones, tablets, and, smartphone, products, have, increased, the, demand, for, batteries, electric, vehicle, batteries, are, anticipated, to, increase, graphite, demand, as, an, example, a, lithium, ion, battery, in, a, fully, electric, nissan, leaf, contains, nearly, 40, kg, of, graphite, radioactive, graphite, removed, from, nuclear, reactors, has, been, investigated, as, a, source, of, electricity, for, low, power, applications, this, waste, is, rich, in, carbon, 14, which, emits, electrons, through, beta, decay, so, it, could, potentially, be, used, as, the, basis, for, a, betavoltaic, device, this, concept, is, known, as, the, diamond, battery, graphite, is, predominant, anode, material, used, today, in, lithium, ion, batteries, ev, batteries, contain, four, basic, components, anode, cathode, electrolyte, and, separator, while, there, is, much, focus, on, the, cathode, materials, lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, etc, the, predominant, anode, material, used, in, virtually, all, ev, batteries, is, graphite, natural, graphite, in, steelmaking, mostly, goes, into, raising, the, carbon, content, in, molten, steel, it, can, also, serve, to, lubricate, the, dies, used, to, extrude, hot, steel, carbon, additives, face, competitive, pricing, from, alternatives, such, as, synthetic, graphite, powder, petroleum, coke, and, other, forms, of, carbon, a, carbon, raiser, is, added, to, increase, the, carbon, content, of, the, steel, to, a, specified, level, an, estimate, based, on, usgs, s, graphite, consumption, statistics, indicates, that, steelmakers, in, the, us, used, 10, 500, tonnes, in, this, fashion, in, 2005, natural, amorphous, and, fine, flake, graphite, are, used, in, brake, linings, or, brake, shoes, for, heavier, nonautomotive, vehicles, and, became, important, with, the, need, to, substitute, for, asbestos, this, use, has, been, important, for, quite, some, time, but, nonasbestos, organic, nao, compositions, are, beginning, to, reduce, graphite, s, market, share, a, brake, lining, industry, shake, out, with, some, plant, closures, has, not, been, beneficial, nor, has, an, indifferent, automotive, market, according, to, the, usgs, us, natural, graphite, consumption, in, brake, linings, was, 6, 510, tonnes, in, 2005, a, foundry, facing, mold, wash, is, a, water, based, paint, of, amorphous, or, fine, flake, graphite, painting, the, inside, of, a, mold, with, it, and, letting, it, dry, leaves, a, fine, graphite, coat, that, will, ease, the, separation, of, the, object, cast, after, the, hot, metal, has, cooled, graphite, lubricants, are, specialty, items, for, use, at, very, high, or, very, low, temperatures, as, forging, die, lubricant, an, antiseize, agent, a, gear, lubricant, for, mining, machinery, and, to, lubricate, locks, having, low, grit, graphite, or, even, better, no, grit, graphite, ultra, high, purity, is, highly, desirable, it, can, be, used, as, a, dry, powder, in, water, or, oil, or, as, colloidal, graphite, a, permanent, suspension, in, a, liquid, an, estimate, based, on, usgs, graphite, consumption, statistics, indicates, that, 2, 200, tonnes, were, used, in, this, fashion, in, 2005, metal, can, also, be, impregnated, into, graphite, to, create, a, self, lubricating, alloy, for, application, in, extreme, conditions, such, as, bearings, for, machines, exposed, to, high, or, low, temperatures, the, ability, to, leave, marks, on, paper, and, other, objects, gave, graphite, its, name, given, in, 1789, by, german, mineralogist, abraham, gottlob, werner, it, stems, from, graphein, meaning, to, write, or, draw, in, ancient, greek, from, the, 16th, century, all, pencils, were, made, with, leads, of, english, natural, graphite, but, modern, pencil, lead, is, most, commonly, a, mix, of, powdered, graphite, and, clay, it, was, invented, by, nicolas, jacques, cont, in, 1795, it, is, chemically, unrelated, to, the, metal, lead, whose, ores, had, a, similar, appearance, hence, the, continuation, of, the, name, plumbago, is, another, older, term, for, natural, graphite, used, for, drawing, typically, as, a, lump, of, the, mineral, without, a, wood, casing, the, term, plumbago, drawing, is, normally, restricted, to, 17th, and, 18th, century, works, mostly, portraits, today, pencils, are, still, a, small, but, significant, market, for, natural, graphite, around, 7, of, the, 1, 1, million, tonnes, produced, in, 2011, was, used, to, make, pencils, low, quality, amorphous, graphite, is, used, and, sourced, mainly, from, china, in, art, graphite, is, typically, used, to, create, detailed, and, precise, drawings, as, it, allows, for, a, wide, range, of, values, light, to, dark, to, be, achieved, it, can, also, be, used, to, create, softer, more, subtle, lines, and, shading, graphite, is, popular, among, artists, because, it, is, easy, to, control, easy, to, erase, and, produces, a, clean, professional, look, it, is, also, relatively, inexpensive, and, widely, available, many, artists, use, graphite, in, conjunction, with, other, media, such, as, charcoal, or, ink, to, create, a, range, of, effects, and, textures, in, their, work, graphite, of, various, hardness, or, softness, results, in, different, qualities, and, tones, when, used, as, an, artistic, medium, graphite, is, probably, the, most, used, lubricant, in, pinewood, derbies, natural, graphite, has, found, uses, in, zinc, carbon, batteries, electric, motor, brushes, and, various, specialized, applications, railroads, would, often, mix, powdered, graphite, with, waste, oil, or, linseed, oil, to, create, a, heat, resistant, protective, coating, for, the, exposed, portions, of, a, steam, locomotive, s, boiler, such, as, the, smokebox, or, lower, part, of, the, firebox, the, scope, soldering, iron, uses, a, graphite, tip, as, its, heating, element, expanded, graphite, is, made, by, immersing, natural, flake, graphite, in, a, bath, of, chromic, acid, then, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, which, forces, the, crystal, lattice, planes, apart, thus, expanding, the, graphite, the, expanded, graphite, can, be, used, to, make, graphite, foil, or, used, directly, as, a, hot, top, compound, to, insulate, molten, metal, in, a, ladle, or, red, hot, steel, ingots, and, decrease, heat, loss, or, as, firestops, fitted, around, a, fire, door, or, in, sheet, metal, collars, surrounding, plastic, pipe, during, a, fire, the, graphite, expands, and, chars, to, resist, fire, penetration, and, spread, or, to, make, high, performance, gasket, material, for, high, temperature, use, after, being, made, into, graphite, foil, the, foil, is, machined, and, assembled, into, the, bipolar, plates, in, fuel, cells, the, foil, is, made, into, heat, sinks, for, laptop, computers, which, keeps, them, cool, while, saving, weight, and, is, made, into, a, foil, laminate, that, can, be, used, in, valve, packings, or, made, into, gaskets, old, style, packings, are, now, a, minor, member, of, this, grouping, fine, flake, graphite, in, oils, or, greases, for, uses, requiring, heat, resistance, a, gan, estimate, of, current, us, natural, graphite, consumption, in, this, end, use, is, 7, 500, tonnes, graphite, forms, intercalation, compounds, with, some, metals, and, small, molecules, in, these, compounds, the, host, molecule, or, atom, gets, sandwiched, between, the, graphite, layers, resulting, in, a, type, of, compound, with, variable, stoichiometry, a, prominent, example, of, an, intercalation, compound, is, potassium, graphite, denoted, by, the, formula, kc, 8, some, graphite, intercalation, compounds, are, superconductors, the, highest, transition, temperature, by, june, 2009, t, c, 11, 5, k, is, achieved, in, cac, 6, and, it, further, increases, under, applied, pressure, 15, 1, k, at, 8, gpa, graphite, s, ability, to, intercalate, lithium, ions, without, significant, damage, from, swelling, is, what, makes, it, the, dominant, anode, material, in, lithium, ion, batteries, in, 1893, charles, street, of, le, carbone, discovered, a, process, for, making, artificial, graphite, in, the, mid, 1890s, edward, goodrich, acheson, 1856, 1931, accidentally, invented, another, way, to, produce, synthetic, graphite, after, synthesizing, carborundum, also, called, silicon, carbide, he, discovered, that, overheating, carborundum, as, opposed, to, pure, carbon, produced, almost, pure, graphite, while, studying, the, effects, of, high, temperature, on, carborundum, he, had, found, that, silicon, vaporizes, at, about, 4, 150, c, 7, 500, f, leaving, the, carbon, behind, in, graphitic, carbon, this, graphite, became, valuable, as, a, lubricant, acheson, s, technique, for, producing, silicon, carbide, and, graphite, is, named, the, acheson, process, in, 1896, acheson, received, a, patent, for, his, method, of, synthesizing,
