ultraviolet, fraction, that, produces, damage, and, thus, mutations, in, the, dna, of, the, skin, cells, there, is, a, correlation, between, the, geographic, distribution, of, ultraviolet, radiation, uvr, and, the, distribution, of, indigenous, skin, pigmentation, around, the, world, darker, skinned, populations, are, found, in, the, regions, with, the, most, ultraviolet, closer, to, the, equator,

sulfur, turn, brownish, or, blackish, as, they, decay, naturally, rich, and, fertile, soils, tend, to, be, darker, in, color, the, deeper, brown, color, of, fertile, soil, comes, from, the, decomposing, of, the, organic, matter, dead, leaves, and, roots, become, black, or, brown, as, they, decay, poorer, soils, are, usually, paler, brown, in, color, and, contain, less, water, or, organic, matter, a, large, number, of, mammals, and, predatory, birds, have, a, brown, coloration, this, sometimes, changes, seasonally, and, sometimes, remains, the, same, year, round, this, color, is, likely, related, to, camouflage, since, the, backdrop, of, some, environments, such, as, the, forest, floor, is, often, brown, and, especially, in, the, spring, and, summertime, when, animals,
