in, the, physical, sciences, a, phase, is, a, region, of, material, that, is, chemically, uniform, physically, distinct, and, often, mechanically, separable, in, a, system, consisting, of, ice, and, water, in, a, glass, jar, the, ice, cubes, are, one, phase, the, water, is, a, second, phase, and, the, humid, air, is, a, third, phase, over, the, ice, and, water, the, glass, of, the, jar, is, a, different, material, in, its, own, separate, phase, see, state, of, matter, glass, more, precisely, a, phase, is, a, region, of, space, a, thermodynamic, system, throughout, which, all, physical, properties, of, a, material, are, essentially, uniform, 86, 3, examples, of, physical, properties, include, density, index, of, refraction, magnetization, and, chemical, composition, the, term, phase, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, state, of, matter, but, there, can, be, several, immiscible, phases, of, the, same, state, of, matter, as, where, oil, and, water, separate, into, distinct, phases, both, in, the, liquid, state, it, is, also, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, equilibrium, states, shown, on, a, phase, diagram, described, in, terms, of, state, variables, such, as, pressure, and, temperature, and, demarcated, by, phase, boundaries, phase, boundaries, relate, to, changes, in, the, organization, of, matter, including, for, example, a, subtle, change, within, the, solid, state, from, one, crystal, structure, to, another, as, well, as, state, changes, such, as, between, solid, and, liquid, these, two, usages, are, not, commensurate, with, the, formal, definition, given, above, and, the, intended, meaning, must, be, determined, in, part, from, the, context, in, which, the, term, is, used, distinct, phases, may, be, described, as, different, states, of, matter, such, as, gas, liquid, solid, plasma, or, bose, einstein, condensate, useful, mesophases, between, solid, and, liquid, form, other, states, of, matter, distinct, phases, may, also, exist, within, a, given, state, of, matter, as, shown, in, the, diagram, for, iron, alloys, several, phases, exist, for, both, the, solid, and, liquid, states, phases, may, also, be, differentiated, based, on, solubility, as, in, polar, hydrophilic, or, non, polar, hydrophobic, a, mixture, of, water, a, polar, liquid, and, oil, a, non, polar, liquid, will, spontaneously, separate, into, two, phases, water, has, a, very, low, solubility, is, insoluble, in, oil, and, oil, has, a, low, solubility, in, water, solubility, is, the, maximum, amount, of, a, solute, that, can, dissolve, in, a, solvent, before, the, solute, ceases, to, dissolve, and, remains, in, a, separate, phase, a, mixture, can, separate, into, more, than, two, liquid, phases, and, the, concept, of, phase, separation, extends, to, solids, i, e, solids, can, form, solid, solutions, or, crystallize, into, distinct, crystal, phases, metal, pairs, that, are, mutually, soluble, can, form, alloys, whereas, metal, pairs, that, are, mutually, insoluble, cannot, as, many, as, eight, immiscible, liquid, phases, have, been, observed, mutually, immiscible, liquid, phases, are, formed, from, water, aqueous, phase, hydrophobic, organic, solvents, perfluorocarbons, fluorous, phase, silicones, several, different, metals, and, also, from, molten, phosphorus, not, all, organic, solvents, are, completely, miscible, e, g, a, mixture, of, ethylene, glycol, and, toluene, may, separate, into, two, distinct, organic, phases, phases, do, not, need, to, macroscopically, separate, spontaneously, emulsions, and, colloids, are, examples, of, immiscible, phase, pair, combinations, that, do, not, physically, separate, left, to, equilibration, many, compositions, will, form, a, uniform, single, phase, but, depending, on, the, temperature, and, pressure, even, a, single, substance, may, separate, into, two, or, more, distinct, phases, within, each, phase, the, properties, are, uniform, but, between, the, two, phases, properties, differ, water, in, a, closed, jar, with, an, air, space, over, it, forms, a, two, phase, system, most, of, the, water, is, in, the, liquid, phase, where, it, is, held, by, the, mutual, attraction, of, water, molecules, even, at, equilibrium, molecules, are, constantly, in, motion, and, once, in, a, while, a, molecule, in, the, liquid, phase, gains, enough, kinetic, energy, to, break, away, from, the, liquid, phase, and, enter, the, gas, phase, likewise, every, once, in, a, while, a, vapor, molecule, collides, with, the, liquid, surface, and, condenses, into, the, liquid, at, equilibrium, evaporation, and, condensation, processes, exactly, balance, and, there, is, no, net, change, in, the, volume, of, either, phase, at, room, temperature, and, pressure, the, water, jar, reaches, equilibrium, when, the, air, over, the, water, has, a, humidity, of, about, 3, this, percentage, increases, as, the, temperature, goes, up, at, 100, c, and, atmospheric, pressure, equilibrium, is, not, reached, until, the, air, is, 100, water, if, the, liquid, is, heated, a, little, over, 100, c, the, transition, from, liquid, to, gas, will, occur, not, only, at, the, surface, but, throughout, the, liquid, volume, the, water, boils, for, a, given, composition, only, certain, phases, are, possible, at, a, given, temperature, and, pressure, the, number, and, type, of, phases, that, will, form, is, hard, to, predict, and, is, usually, determined, by, experiment, the, results, of, such, experiments, can, be, plotted, in, phase, diagrams, the, phase, diagram, shown, here, is, for, a, single, component, system, in, this, simple, system, phases, that, are, possible, depend, only, on, pressure, and, temperature, the, markings, show, points, where, two, or, more, phases, can, co, exist, in, equilibrium, at, temperatures, and, pressures, away, from, the, markings, there, will, be, only, one, phase, at, equilibrium, in, the, diagram, the, blue, line, marking, the, boundary, between, liquid, and, gas, does, not, continue, indefinitely, but, terminates, at, a, point, called, the, critical, point, as, the, temperature, and, pressure, approach, the, critical, point, the, properties, of, the, liquid, and, gas, become, progressively, more, similar, at, the, critical, point, the, liquid, and, gas, become, indistinguishable, above, the, critical, point, there, are, no, longer, separate, liquid, and, gas, phases, there, is, only, a, generic, fluid, phase, referred, to, as, a, supercritical, fluid, in, water, the, critical, point, occurs, at, around, 647, k, 374, c, or, 705, f, and, 22, 064, mpa, an, unusual, feature, of, the, water, phase, diagram, is, that, the, solid, liquid, phase, line, illustrated, by, the, dotted, green, line, has, a, negative, slope, for, most, substances, the, slope, is, positive, as, exemplified, by, the, dark, green, line, this, unusual, feature, of, water, is, related, to, ice, having, a, lower, density, than, liquid, water, increasing, the, pressure, drives, the, water, into, the, higher, density, phase, which, causes, melting, another, interesting, though, not, unusual, feature, of, the, phase, diagram, is, the, point, where, the, solid, liquid, phase, line, meets, the, liquid, gas, phase, line, the, intersection, is, referred, to, as, the, triple, point, at, the, triple, point, all, three, phases, can, coexist, experimentally, phase, lines, are, relatively, easy, to, map, due, to, the, interdependence, of, temperature, and, pressure, that, develops, when, multiple, phases, form, gibbs, phase, rule, suggests, that, different, phases, are, completely, determined, by, these, variables, consider, a, test, apparatus, consisting, of, a, closed, and, well, insulated, cylinder, equipped, with, a, piston, by, controlling, the, temperature, and, the, pressure, the, system, can, be, brought, to, any, point, on, the, phase, diagram, from, a, point, in, the, solid, stability, region, left, side, of, the, diagram, increasing, the, temperature, of, the, system, would, bring, it, into, the, region, where, a, liquid, or, a, gas, is, the, equilibrium, phase, depending, on, the, pressure, if, the, piston, is, slowly, lowered, the, system, will, trace, a, curve, of, increasing, temperature, and, pressure, within, the, gas, region, of, the, phase, diagram, at, the, point, where, gas, begins, to, condense, to, liquid, the, direction, of, the, temperature, and, pressure, curve, will, abruptly, change, to, trace, along, the, phase, line, until, all, of, the, water, has, condensed, between, two, phases, in, equilibrium, there, is, a, narrow, region, where, the, properties, are, not, that, of, either, phase, although, this, region, may, be, very, thin, it, can, have, significant, and, easily, observable, effects, such, as, causing, a, liquid, to, exhibit, surface, tension, in, mixtures, some, components, may, preferentially, move, toward, the, interface, in, terms, of, modeling, describing, or, understanding, the, behavior, of, a, particular, system, it, may, be, efficacious, to, treat, the, interfacial, region, as, a, separate, phase, a, single, material, may, have, several, distinct, solid, states, capable, of, forming, separate, phases, water, is, a, well, known, example, of, such, a, material, for, example, water, ice, is, ordinarily, found, in, the, hexagonal, form, ice, i, h, but, can, also, exist, as, the, cubic, ice, i, c, the, rhombohedral, ice, ii, and, many, other, forms, polymorphism, is, the, ability, of, a, solid, to, exist, in, more, than, one, crystal, form, for, pure, chemical, elements, polymorphism, is, known, as, allotropy, for, example, diamond, graphite, and, fullerenes, are, different, allotropes, of, carbon, when, a, substance, undergoes, a, phase, transition, changes, from, one, state, of, matter, to, another, it, usually, either, takes, up, or, releases, energy, for, example, when, water, evaporates, the, increase, in, kinetic, energy, as, the, evaporating, molecules, escape, the, attractive, forces, of, the, liquid, is, reflected, in, a, decrease, in, temperature, the, energy, required, to, induce, the, phase, transition, is, taken, from, the, internal, thermal, energy, of, the, water, which, cools, the, liquid, to, a, lower, temperature, hence, evaporation, is, useful, for, cooling, see, enthalpy, of, vaporization, the, reverse, process, condensation, releases, heat, the, heat, energy, or, enthalpy, associated, with, a, solid, to, liquid, transition, is, the, enthalpy, of, fusion, and, that, associated, with, a, solid, to, gas, transition, is, the, enthalpy, of, sublimation, while, phases, of, matter, are, traditionally, defined, for, systems, in, thermal, equilibrium, work, on, quantum, many, body, localized, mbl, systems, has, provided, a, framework, for, defining, phases, out, of, equilibrium, mbl, phases, never, reach, thermal, equilibrium, and, can, allow, for, new, forms, of, order, disallowed, in, equilibrium, via, a, phenomenon, known, as, localization, protected, quantum, order, the, transitions, between, different, mbl, phases, and, between, mbl, and, thermalizing, phases, are, novel, dynamical, phase, transitions, whose, properties, are, active, areas, of, research
