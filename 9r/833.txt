the, atomic, nucleus, is, the, small, dense, region, consisting, of, protons, and, neutrons, at, the, center, of, an, atom, discovered, in, 1911, by, ernest, rutherford, based, on, the, 1909, geiger, marsden, gold, foil, experiment, after, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, in, 1932, models, for, a, nucleus, composed, of, protons, and, neutrons, were, quickly, developed, by, dmitri, ivanenko, and, werner, heisenberg, an, atom, is, composed, of, a, positively, charged, nucleus, with, a, cloud, of, negatively, charged, electrons, surrounding, it, bound, together, by, electrostatic, force, almost, all, of, the, mass, of, an, atom, is, located, in, the, nucleus, with, a, very, small, contribution, from, the, electron, cloud, protons, and, neutrons, are, bound, together, to, form, a, nucleus, by, the, nuclear, force, the, diameter, of, the, nucleus, is, in, the, range, of, 1, 70, fm, 1, 70, 10, 15, m, for, hydrogen, the, diameter, of, a, single, proton, to, about, 11, 7, fm, for, uranium, these, dimensions, are, much, smaller, than, the, diameter, of, the, atom, itself, nucleus, electron, cloud, by, a, factor, of, about, 26, 634, uranium, atomic, radius, is, about, 156, pm, 156, 10, 12, m, to, about, 60, 250, hydrogen, atomic, radius, is, about, 52, 92, pm, the, branch, of, physics, concerned, with, the, study, and, understanding, of, the, atomic, nucleus, including, its, composition, and, the, forces, that, bind, it, together, is, called, nuclear, physics, the, nucleus, was, discovered, in, 1911, as, a, result, of, ernest, rutherford, s, efforts, to, test, thomson, s, plum, pudding, model, of, the, atom, the, electron, had, already, been, discovered, by, j, j, thomson, knowing, that, atoms, are, electrically, neutral, j, j, thomson, postulated, that, there, must, be, a, positive, charge, as, well, in, his, plum, pudding, model, thomson, suggested, that, an, atom, consisted, of, negative, electrons, randomly, scattered, within, a, sphere, of, positive, charge, ernest, rutherford, later, devised, an, experiment, with, his, research, partner, hans, geiger, and, with, help, of, ernest, marsden, that, involved, the, deflection, of, alpha, particles, helium, nuclei, directed, at, a, thin, sheet, of, metal, foil, he, reasoned, that, if, j, j, thomson, s, model, were, correct, the, positively, charged, alpha, particles, would, easily, pass, through, the, foil, with, very, little, deviation, in, their, paths, as, the, foil, should, act, as, electrically, neutral, if, the, negative, and, positive, charges, are, so, intimately, mixed, as, to, make, it, appear, neutral, to, his, surprise, many, of, the, particles, were, deflected, at, very, large, angles, because, the, mass, of, an, alpha, particle, is, about, 8000, times, that, of, an, electron, it, became, apparent, that, a, very, strong, force, must, be, present, if, it, could, deflect, the, massive, and, fast, moving, alpha, particles, he, realized, that, the, plum, pudding, model, could, not, be, accurate, and, that, the, deflections, of, the, alpha, particles, could, only, be, explained, if, the, positive, and, negative, charges, were, separated, from, each, other, and, that, the, mass, of, the, atom, was, a, concentrated, point, of, positive, charge, this, justified, the, idea, of, a, nuclear, atom, with, a, dense, center, of, positive, charge, and, mass, the, term, nucleus, is, from, the, latin, word, nucleus, a, diminutive, of, nux, nut, meaning, the, kernel, i, e, the, small, nut, inside, a, watery, type, of, fruit, like, a, peach, in, 1844, michael, faraday, used, the, term, to, refer, to, the, central, point, of, an, atom, the, modern, atomic, meaning, was, proposed, by, ernest, rutherford, in, 1912, the, adoption, of, the, term, nucleus, to, atomic, theory, however, was, not, immediate, in, 1916, for, example, gilbert, n, lewis, stated, in, his, famous, article, the, atom, and, the, molecule, that, the, atom, is, composed, of, the, kernel, and, an, outer, atom, or, shell, similarly, the, term, kern, meaning, kernel, is, used, for, nucleus, in, german, and, dutch, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, consists, of, neutrons, and, protons, which, in, turn, are, the, manifestation, of, more, elementary, particles, called, quarks, that, are, held, in, association, by, the, nuclear, strong, force, in, certain, stable, combinations, of, hadrons, called, baryons, the, nuclear, strong, force, extends, far, enough, from, each, baryon, so, as, to, bind, the, neutrons, and, protons, together, against, the, repulsive, electrical, force, between, the, positively, charged, protons, the, nuclear, strong, force, has, a, very, short, range, and, essentially, drops, to, zero, just, beyond, the, edge, of, the, nucleus, the, collective, action, of, the, positively, charged, nucleus, is, to, hold, the, electrically, negative, charged, electrons, in, their, orbits, about, the, nucleus, the, collection, of, negatively, charged, electrons, orbiting, the, nucleus, display, an, affinity, for, certain, configurations, and, numbers, of, electrons, that, make, their, orbits, stable, which, chemical, element, an, atom, represents, is, determined, by, the, number, of, protons, in, the, nucleus, the, neutral, atom, will, have, an, equal, number, of, electrons, orbiting, that, nucleus, individual, chemical, elements, can, create, more, stable, electron, configurations, by, combining, to, share, their, electrons, it, is, that, sharing, of, electrons, to, create, stable, electronic, orbits, about, the, nuclei, that, appears, to, us, as, the, chemistry, of, our, macro, world, protons, define, the, entire, charge, of, a, nucleus, and, hence, its, chemical, identity, neutrons, are, electrically, neutral, but, contribute, to, the, mass, of, a, nucleus, to, nearly, the, same, extent, as, the, protons, neutrons, can, explain, the, phenomenon, of, isotopes, same, atomic, number, with, different, atomic, mass, the, main, role, of, neutrons, is, to, reduce, electrostatic, repulsion, inside, the, nucleus, protons, and, neutrons, are, fermions, with, different, values, of, the, strong, isospin, quantum, number, so, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, can, share, the, same, space, wave, function, since, they, are, not, identical, quantum, entities, they, are, sometimes, viewed, as, two, different, quantum, states, of, the, same, particle, the, nucleon, two, fermions, such, as, two, protons, or, two, neutrons, or, a, proton, neutron, the, deuteron, can, exhibit, bosonic, behavior, when, they, become, loosely, bound, in, pairs, which, have, integer, spin, in, the, rare, case, of, a, hypernucleus, a, third, baryon, called, a, hyperon, containing, one, or, more, strange, quarks, and, or, other, unusual, quark, s, can, also, share, the, wave, function, however, this, type, of, nucleus, is, extremely, unstable, and, not, found, on, earth, except, in, high, energy, physics, experiments, the, neutron, has, a, positively, charged, core, of, radius, 0, 3, fm, surrounded, by, a, compensating, negative, charge, of, radius, between, 0, 3, fm, and, 2, fm, the, proton, has, an, approximately, exponentially, decaying, positive, charge, distribution, with, a, mean, square, radius, of, about, 0, 8, fm, the, shape, of, the, atomic, nucleus, can, be, spherical, rugby, ball, shaped, prolate, deformation, discus, shaped, oblate, deformation, triaxial, a, combination, of, oblate, and, prolate, deformation, or, pear, shaped, nuclei, are, bound, together, by, the, residual, strong, force, nuclear, force, the, residual, strong, force, is, a, minor, residuum, of, the, strong, interaction, which, binds, quarks, together, to, form, protons, and, neutrons, this, force, is, much, weaker, between, neutrons, and, protons, because, it, is, mostly, neutralized, within, them, in, the, same, way, that, electromagnetic, forces, between, neutral, atoms, such, as, van, der, waals, forces, that, act, between, two, inert, gas, atoms, are, much, weaker, than, the, electromagnetic, forces, that, hold, the, parts, of, the, atoms, together, internally, for, example, the, forces, that, hold, the, electrons, in, an, inert, gas, atom, bound, to, its, nucleus, the, nuclear, force, is, highly, attractive, at, the, distance, of, typical, nucleon, separation, and, this, overwhelms, the, repulsion, between, protons, due, to, the, electromagnetic, force, thus, allowing, nuclei, to, exist, however, the, residual, strong, force, has, a, limited, range, because, it, decays, quickly, with, distance, see, yukawa, potential, thus, only, nuclei, smaller, than, a, certain, size, can, be, completely, stable, the, largest, known, completely, stable, nucleus, i, e, stable, to, alpha, beta, and, gamma, decay, is, lead, 208, which, contains, a, total, of, 208, nucleons, 126, neutrons, and, 82, protons, nuclei, larger, than, this, maximum, are, unstable, and, tend, to, be, increasingly, short, lived, with, larger, numbers, of, nucleons, however, bismuth, 209, is, also, stable, to, beta, decay, and, has, the, longest, half, life, to, alpha, decay, of, any, known, isotope, estimated, at, a, billion, times, longer, than, the, age, of, the, universe, the, residual, strong, force, is, effective, over, a, very, short, range, usually, only, a, few, femtometres, fm, roughly, one, or, two, nucleon, diameters, and, causes, an, attraction, between, any, pair, of, nucleons, for, example, between, a, proton, and, a, neutron, to, form, a, deuteron, and, also, between, protons, and, protons, and, neutrons, and, neutrons, the, effective, absolute, limit, of, the, range, of, the, nuclear, force, also, known, as, residual, strong, force, is, represented, by, halo, nuclei, such, as, lithium, 11, or, boron, 14, in, which, dineutrons, or, other, collections, of, neutrons, orbit, at, distances, of, about, 10, fm, roughly, similar, to, the, 8, fm, radius, of, the, nucleus, of, uranium, 238, these, nuclei, are, not, maximally, dense, halo, nuclei, form, at, the, extreme, edges, of, the, chart, of, the, nuclides, the, neutron, drip, line, and, proton, drip, line, and, are, all, unstable, with, short, half, lives, measured, in, milliseconds, for, example, lithium, 11, has, a, half, life, of, 8, 8, ms, halos, in, effect, represent, an, excited, state, with, nucleons, in, an, outer, quantum, shell, which, has, unfilled, energy, levels, below, it, both, in, terms, of, radius, and, energy, the, halo, may, be, made, of, either, neutrons, or, protons, nuclei, which, have, a, single, neutron, halo, include, 11, be, and, 19, c, a, two, neutron, halo, is, exhibited, by, 6, he, 11, li, 17, b, 19, b, and, 22, c, two, neutron, halo, nuclei, break, into, three, fragments, never, two, and, are, called, borromean, nuclei, because, of, this, behavior, referring, to, a, system, of, three, interlocked, rings, in, which, breaking, any, ring, frees, both, of, the, others, 8, he, and, 14, be, both, exhibit, a, four, neutron, halo, nuclei, which, have, a, proton, halo, include, 8, b, and, 26, p, a, two, proton, halo, is, exhibited, by, 17, ne, and, 27, s, proton, halos, are, expected, to, be, more, rare, and, unstable, than, the, neutron, examples, because, of, the, repulsive, electromagnetic, forces, of, the, halo, proton, s, although, the, standard, model, of, physics, is, widely, believed, to, completely, describe, the, composition, and, behavior, of, the, nucleus, generating, predictions, from, theory, is, much, more, difficult, than, for, most, other, areas, of, particle, physics, this, is, due, to, two, reasons, historically, experiments, have, been, compared, to, relatively, crude, models, that, are, necessarily, imperfect, none, of, these, models, can, completely, explain, experimental, data, on, nuclear, structure, the, nuclear, radius, r, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, basic, quantities, that, any, model, must, predict, for, stable, nuclei, not, halo, nuclei, or, other, unstable, distorted, nuclei, the, nuclear, radius, is, roughly, proportional, to, the, cube, root, of, the, mass, number, a, of, the, nucleus, and, particularly, in, nuclei, containing, many, nucleons, as, they, arrange, in, more, spherical, configurations, the, stable, nucleus, has, approximately, a, constant, density, and, therefore, the, nuclear, radius, r, can, be, approximated, by, the, following, formula, where, a, atomic, mass, number, the, number, of, protons, z, plus, the, number, of, neutrons, n, and, r, 0, 1, 25, fm, 1, 25, 10, 15, m, in, this, equation, the, constant, r, 0, varies, by, 0, 2, fm, depending, on, the, nucleus, in, question, but, this, is, less, than, 20, change, from, a, constant, in, other, words, packing, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, nucleus, gives, approximately, the, same, total, size, result, as, packing, hard, spheres, of, a, constant, size, like, marbles, into, a, tight, spherical, or, almost, spherical, bag, some, stable, nuclei, are, not, quite, spherical, but, are, known, to, be, prolate, models, of, nuclear, structure, include, the, cluster, model, describes, the, nucleus, as, a, molecule, like, collection, of, proton, neutron, groups, e, g, alpha, particles, with, one, or, more, valence, neutrons, occupying, molecular, orbitals, early, models, of, the, nucleus, viewed, the, nucleus, as, a, rotating, liquid, drop, in, this, model, the, trade, off, of, long, range, electromagnetic, forces, and, relatively, short, range, nuclear, forces, together, cause, behavior, which, resembled, surface, tension, forces, in, liquid, drops, of, different, sizes, this, formula, is, successful, at, explaining, many, important, phenomena, of, nuclei, such, as, their, changing, amounts, of, binding, energy, as, their, size, and, composition, changes, see, semi, empirical, mass, formula, but, it, does, not, explain, the, special, stability, which, occurs, when, nuclei, have, special, magic, numbers, of, protons, or, neutrons, the, terms, in, the, semi, empirical, mass, formula, which, can, be, used, to, approximate, the, binding, energy, of, many, nuclei, are, considered, as, the, sum, of, five, types, of, energies, see, below, then, the, picture, of, a, nucleus, as, a, drop, of, incompressible, liquid, roughly, accounts, for, the, observed, variation, of, binding, energy, of, the, nucleus, volume, energy, when, an, assembly, of, nucleons, of, the, same, size, is, packed, together, into, the, smallest, volume, each, interior, nucleon, has, a, certain, number, of, other, nucleons, in, contact, with, it, so, this, nuclear, energy, is, proportional, to, the, volume, surface, energy, a, nucleon, at, the, surface, of, a, nucleus, interacts, with, fewer, other, nucleons, than, one, in, the, interior, of, the, nucleus, and, hence, its, binding, energy, is, less, this, surface, energy, term, takes, that, into, account, and, is, therefore, negative, and, is, proportional, to, the, surface, area, coulomb, energy, the, electric, repulsion, between, each, pair, of, protons, in, a, nucleus, contributes, toward, decreasing, its, binding, energy, asymmetry, energy, also, called, pauli, energy, an, energy, associated, with, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, were, it, not, for, the, coulomb, energy, the, most, stable, form, of, nuclear, matter, would, have, the, same, number, of, neutrons, as, protons, since, unequal, numbers, of, neutrons, and, protons, imply, filling, higher, energy, levels, for, one, type, of, particle, while, leaving, lower, energy, levels, vacant, for, the, other, type, pairing, energy, an, energy, which, is, a, correction, term, that, arises, from, the, tendency, of, proton, pairs, and, neutron, pairs, to, occur, an, even, number, of, particles, is, more, stable, than, an, odd, number, a, number, of, models, for, the, nucleus, have, also, been, proposed, in, which, nucleons, occupy, orbitals, much, like, the, atomic, orbitals, in, atomic, physics, theory, these, wave, models, imagine, nucleons, to, be, either, sizeless, point, particles, in, potential, wells, or, else, probability, waves, as, in, the, optical, model, frictionlessly, orbiting, at, high, speed, in, potential, wells, in, the, above, models, the, nucleons, may, occupy, orbitals, in, pairs, due, to, being, fermions, which, allows, explanation, of, even, odd, z, and, n, effects, well, known, from, experiments, the, exact, nature, and, capacity, of, nuclear, shells, differs, from, those, of, electrons, in, atomic, orbitals, primarily, because, the, potential, well, in, which, the, nucleons, move, especially, in, larger, nuclei, is, quite, different, from, the, central, electromagnetic, potential, well, which, binds, electrons, in, atoms, some, resemblance, to, atomic, orbital, models, may, be, seen, in, a, small, atomic, nucleus, like, that, of, helium, 4, in, which, the, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, separately, occupy, 1s, orbitals, analogous, to, the, 1s, orbital, for, the, two, electrons, in, the, helium, atom, and, achieve, unusual, stability, for, the, same, reason, nuclei, with, 5, nucleons, are, all, extremely, unstable, and, short, lived, yet, helium, 3, with, 3, nucleons, is, very, stable, even, with, lack, of, a, closed, 1s, orbital, shell, another, nucleus, with, 3, nucleons, the, triton, hydrogen, 3, is, unstable, and, will, decay, into, helium, 3, when, isolated, weak, nuclear, stability, with, 2, nucleons, np, in, the, 1s, orbital, is, found, in, the, deuteron, hydrogen, 2, with, only, one, nucleon, in, each, of, the, proton, and, neutron, potential, wells, while, each, nucleon, is, a, fermion, the, np, deuteron, is, a, boson, and, thus, does, not, follow, pauli, exclusion, for, close, packing, within, shells, lithium, 6, with, 6, nucleons, is, highly, stable, without, a, closed, second, 1p, shell, orbital, for, light, nuclei, with, total, nucleon, numbers, 1, to, 6, only, those, with, 5, do, not, show, some, evidence, of, stability, observations, of, beta, stability, of, light, nuclei, outside, closed, shells, indicate, that, nuclear, stability, is, much, more, complex, than, simple, closure, of, shell, orbitals, with, magic, numbers, of, protons, and, neutrons, for, larger, nuclei, the, shells, occupied, by, nucleons, begin, to, differ, significantly, from, electron, shells, but, nevertheless, present, nuclear, theory, does, predict, the, magic, numbers, of, filled, nuclear, shells, for, both, protons, and, neutrons, the, closure, of, the, stable, shells, predicts, unusually, stable, configurations, analogous, to, the, noble, group, of, nearly, inert, gases, in, chemistry, an, example, is, the, stability, of, the, closed, shell, of, 50, protons, which, allows, tin, to, have, 10, stable, isotopes, more, than, any, other, element, similarly, the, distance, from, shell, closure, explains, the, unusual, instability, of, isotopes, which, have, far, from, stable, numbers, of, these, particles, such, as, the, radioactive, elements, 43, technetium, and, 61, promethium, each, of, which, is, preceded, and, followed, by, 17, or, more, stable, elements, there, are, however, problems, with, the, shell, model, when, an, attempt, is, made, to, account, for, nuclear, properties, well, away, from, closed, shells, this, has, led, to, complex, post, hoc, distortions, of, the, shape, of, the, potential, well, to, fit, experimental, data, but, the, question, remains, whether, these, mathematical, manipulations, actually, correspond, to, the, spatial, deformations, in, real, nuclei, problems, with, the, shell, model, have, led, some, to, propose, realistic, two, body, and, three, body, nuclear, force, effects, involving, nucleon, clusters, and, then, build, the, nucleus, on, this, basis, three, such, cluster, models, are, the, 1936, resonating, group, structure, model, of, john, wheeler, close, packed, spheron, model, of, linus, pauling, and, the, 2d, ising, model, of, macgregor, as, with, the, case, of, superfluid, liquid, helium, atomic, nuclei, are, an, example, of, a, state, in, which, both, 1, ordinary, particle, physical, rules, for, volume, and, 2, non, intuitive, quantum, mechanical, rules, for, a, wave, like, nature, apply, in, superfluid, helium, the, helium, atoms, have, volume, and, essentially, touch, each, other, yet, at, the, same, time, exhibit, strange, bulk, properties, consistent, with, a, bose, einstein, condensation, the, nucleons, in, atomic, nuclei, also, exhibit, a, wave, like, nature, and, lack, standard, fluid, properties, such, as, friction, for, nuclei, made, of, hadrons, which, are, fermions, bose, einstein, condensation, does, not, occur, yet, nevertheless, many, nuclear, properties, can, only, be, explained, similarly, by, a, combination, of, properties, of, particles, with, volume, in, addition, to, the, frictionless, motion, characteristic, of, the, wave, like, behavior, of, objects, trapped, in, erwin, schr, dinger, s, quantum, orbitals
