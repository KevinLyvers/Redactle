a, lithosphere, from, ancient, greek, l, thos, rocky, and, spha, ra, sphere, is, the, rigid, outermost, rocky, shell, of, a, terrestrial, planet, or, natural, satellite, on, earth, it, is, composed, of, the, crust, and, the, lithospheric, mantle, the, topmost, portion, of, the, upper, mantle, that, behaves, elastically, on, time, scales, of, up, to, thousands, of, years, or, more, the, crust, and, upper, mantle, are, distinguished, on, the, basis, of, chemistry, and, mineralogy, earth, s, lithosphere, which, constitutes, the, hard, and, rigid, outer, vertical, layer, of, the, earth, includes, the, crust, and, the, lithospheric, mantle, or, mantle, lithosphere, the, uppermost, part, of, the, mantle, that, is, not, convecting, the, lithosphere, is, underlain, by, the, asthenosphere, which, is, the, weaker, hotter, and, deeper, part, of, the, upper, mantle, that, is, able, to, convect, the, lithosphere, asthenosphere, boundary, is, defined, by, a, difference, in, response, to, stress, the, lithosphere, remains, rigid, for, very, long, periods, of, geologic, time, in, which, it, deforms, elastically, and, through, brittle, failure, while, the, asthenosphere, deforms, viscously, and, accommodates, strain, through, plastic, deformation, the, thickness, of, the, lithosphere, is, thus, considered, to, be, the, depth, to, the, isotherm, associated, with, the, transition, between, brittle, and, viscous, behavior, the, temperature, at, which, olivine, becomes, ductile, 1, 000, c, or, 1, 830, f, is, often, used, to, set, this, isotherm, because, olivine, is, generally, the, weakest, mineral, in, the, upper, mantle, the, lithosphere, is, subdivided, horizontally, into, tectonic, plates, which, often, include, terranes, accreted, from, other, plates, the, concept, of, the, lithosphere, as, earth, s, strong, outer, layer, was, described, by, the, english, mathematician, a, e, h, love, in, his, 1911, monograph, some, problems, of, geodynamics, and, further, developed, by, the, american, geologist, joseph, barrell, who, wrote, a, series, of, papers, about, the, concept, and, introduced, the, term, lithosphere, the, concept, was, based, on, the, presence, of, significant, gravity, anomalies, over, continental, crust, from, which, he, inferred, that, there, must, exist, a, strong, solid, upper, layer, which, he, called, the, lithosphere, above, a, weaker, layer, which, could, flow, which, he, called, the, asthenosphere, these, ideas, were, expanded, by, the, canadian, geologist, reginald, aldworth, daly, in, 1940, with, his, seminal, work, strength, and, structure, of, the, earth, they, have, been, broadly, accepted, by, geologists, and, geophysicists, these, concepts, of, a, strong, lithosphere, resting, on, a, weak, asthenosphere, are, essential, to, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, the, lithosphere, can, be, divided, into, oceanic, and, continental, lithosphere, oceanic, lithosphere, is, associated, with, oceanic, crust, having, a, mean, density, of, about, 2, 9, grams, per, cubic, centimetre, or, 0, 10, pounds, per, cubic, inch, and, exists, in, the, ocean, basins, continental, lithosphere, is, associated, with, continental, crust, having, a, mean, density, of, about, 2, 7, grams, per, cubic, centimetre, or, 0, 098, pounds, per, cubic, inch, and, underlies, the, continents, and, continental, shelves, oceanic, lithosphere, consists, mainly, of, mafic, crust, and, ultramafic, mantle, peridotite, and, is, denser, than, continental, lithosphere, young, oceanic, lithosphere, found, at, mid, ocean, ridges, is, no, thicker, than, the, crust, but, oceanic, lithosphere, thickens, as, it, ages, and, moves, away, from, the, mid, ocean, ridge, the, oldest, oceanic, lithosphere, is, typically, about, 140, kilometres, 87, mi, thick, this, thickening, occurs, by, conductive, cooling, which, converts, hot, asthenosphere, into, lithospheric, mantle, and, causes, the, oceanic, lithosphere, to, become, increasingly, thick, and, dense, with, age, in, fact, oceanic, lithosphere, is, a, thermal, boundary, layer, for, the, convection, in, the, mantle, the, thickness, of, the, mantle, part, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, can, be, approximated, as, a, thermal, boundary, layer, that, thickens, as, the, square, root, of, time, h, 2, t, displaystyle, h, sim, 2, sqrt, kappa, t, here, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, thickness, of, the, oceanic, mantle, lithosphere, displaystyle, kappa, is, the, thermal, diffusivity, approximately, 1, 0, 10, 6, m, 2, s, or, 6, 5, 10, 4, sq, ft, min, for, silicate, rocks, and, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, age, of, the, given, part, of, the, lithosphere, the, age, is, often, equal, to, l, v, where, l, is, the, distance, from, the, spreading, centre, of, mid, oceanic, ridge, and, v, is, velocity, of, the, lithospheric, plate, oceanic, lithosphere, is, less, dense, than, asthenosphere, for, a, few, tens, of, millions, of, years, but, after, this, becomes, increasingly, denser, than, asthenosphere, while, chemically, differentiated, oceanic, crust, is, lighter, than, asthenosphere, thermal, contraction, of, the, mantle, lithosphere, makes, it, more, dense, than, the, asthenosphere, the, gravitational, instability, of, mature, oceanic, lithosphere, has, the, effect, that, at, subduction, zones, oceanic, lithosphere, invariably, sinks, underneath, the, overriding, lithosphere, which, can, be, oceanic, or, continental, new, oceanic, lithosphere, is, constantly, being, produced, at, mid, ocean, ridges, and, is, recycled, back, to, the, mantle, at, subduction, zones, as, a, result, oceanic, lithosphere, is, much, younger, than, continental, lithosphere, the, oldest, oceanic, lithosphere, is, about, 170, million, years, old, while, parts, of, the, continental, lithosphere, are, billions, of, years, old, geophysical, studies, in, the, early, 21st, century, posit, that, large, pieces, of, the, lithosphere, have, been, subducted, into, the, mantle, as, deep, as, 2, 900, kilometres, 1, 800, mi, to, near, the, core, mantle, boundary, while, others, float, in, the, upper, mantle, yet, others, stick, down, into, the, mantle, as, far, as, 400, kilometres, 250, mi, but, remain, attached, to, the, continental, plate, above, similar, to, the, extent, of, the, old, concept, of, tectosphere, revisited, by, jordan, in, 1988, subducting, lithosphere, remains, rigid, as, demonstrated, by, deep, earthquakes, along, wadati, benioff, zone, to, a, depth, of, about, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, continental, lithosphere, has, a, range, in, thickness, from, about, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, to, perhaps, 280, kilometres, 170, mi, the, upper, approximately, 30, to, 50, kilometres, 19, to, 31, mi, of, typical, continental, lithosphere, is, crust, the, crust, is, distinguished, from, the, upper, mantle, by, the, change, in, chemical, composition, that, takes, place, at, the, moho, discontinuity, the, oldest, parts, of, continental, lithosphere, underlie, cratons, and, the, mantle, lithosphere, there, is, thicker, and, less, dense, than, typical, the, relatively, low, density, of, such, mantle, roots, of, cratons, helps, to, stabilize, these, regions, because, of, its, relatively, low, density, continental, lithosphere, that, arrives, at, a, subduction, zone, cannot, subduct, much, further, than, about, 100, km, 62, mi, before, resurfacing, as, a, result, continental, lithosphere, is, not, recycled, at, subduction, zones, the, way, oceanic, lithosphere, is, recycled, instead, continental, lithosphere, is, a, nearly, permanent, feature, of, the, earth, geoscientists, can, directly, study, the, nature, of, the, subcontinental, mantle, by, examining, mantle, xenoliths, brought, up, in, kimberlite, lamproite, and, other, volcanic, pipes, the, histories, of, these, xenoliths, have, been, investigated, by, many, methods, including, analyses, of, abundances, of, isotopes, of, osmium, and, rhenium, such, studies, have, confirmed, that, mantle, lithospheres, below, some, cratons, have, persisted, for, periods, in, excess, of, 3, billion, years, despite, the, mantle, flow, that, accompanies, plate, tectonics, the, upper, part, of, the, lithosphere, is, a, large, habitat, for, microorganisms, with, some, found, more, than, 4, 8, km, 3, mi, below, earth, s, surface
