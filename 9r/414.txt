thulium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, tm, and, atomic, number, 69, it, is, the, thirteenth, element, in, the, lanthanide, series, of, metals, it, is, the, second, least, abundant, lanthanide, in, the, earth, s, crust, after, radioactively, unstable, promethium, it, is, an, easily, workable, metal, with, a, bright, silvery, gray, luster, it, is, fairly, soft, and, slowly, tarnishes, in, air, despite, its, high, price, and, rarity, thulium, is, used, as, a, dopant, in, solid, state, lasers, and, as, the, radiation, source, in, some, portable, x, ray, devices, it, has, no, significant, biological, role, and, is, not, particularly, toxic, in, 1879, the, swedish, chemist, per, teodor, cleve, separated, two, previously, unknown, components, which, he, called, holmia, and, thulia, from, the, rare, earth, mineral, erbia, these, were, the, oxides, of, holmium, and, thulium, respectively, a, relatively, pure, sample, of, thulium, metal, was, first, obtained, in, 1911, like, the, other, lanthanides, its, most, common, oxidation, state, is, 3, seen, in, its, oxide, halides, and, other, compounds, in, aqueous, solution, like, compounds, of, other, late, lanthanides, soluble, thulium, compounds, form, coordination, complexes, with, nine, water, molecules, pure, thulium, metal, has, a, bright, silvery, luster, which, tarnishes, on, exposure, to, air, the, metal, can, be, cut, with, a, knife, as, it, has, a, mohs, hardness, of, 2, to, 3, it, is, malleable, and, ductile, thulium, is, ferromagnetic, below, 32, k, antiferromagnetic, between, 32, and, 56, k, and, paramagnetic, above, 56, k, thulium, has, two, major, allotropes, the, tetragonal, tm, and, the, more, stable, hexagonal, tm, thulium, tarnishes, slowly, in, air, and, burns, readily, at, 150, c, to, form, thulium, iii, oxide, thulium, is, quite, electropositive, and, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quite, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, thulium, hydroxide, thulium, reacts, with, all, the, halogens, reactions, are, slow, at, room, temperature, but, are, vigorous, above, 200, c, thulium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, pale, green, tm, iii, ions, which, exist, as, 3, complexes, thulium, reacts, with, various, metallic, and, non, metallic, elements, forming, a, range, of, binary, compounds, including, tmn, tms, tmc, 2, tm, 2, c, 3, tmh, 2, tmh, 3, tmsi, 2, tmge, 3, tmb, 4, tmb, 6, and, tmb, 12, like, most, lanthanides, the, 3, state, is, most, common, and, is, the, only, state, observed, in, thulium, solutions, thulium, exists, as, a, tm, 3, ion, in, solution, in, this, state, the, thulium, ion, is, surrounded, by, nine, molecules, of, water, tm, 3, ions, exhibit, a, bright, blue, luminescence, because, it, occurs, late, in, the, series, the, 2, oxidation, state, can, also, exist, stabilized, by, the, nearly, full, 4f, electron, shell, but, occurs, only, in, solids, thulium, s, only, known, oxide, is, tm, 2, o, 3, this, oxide, is, sometimes, called, thulia, reddish, purple, thulium, ii, compounds, can, be, made, by, the, reduction, of, thulium, iii, compounds, examples, of, thulium, ii, compounds, include, the, halides, except, the, fluoride, some, hydrated, thulium, compounds, such, as, tmcl, 3, 7h, 2, o, and, tm, 2, c, 2, o, 4, 3, 6h, 2, o, are, green, or, greenish, white, thulium, dichloride, reacts, very, vigorously, with, water, this, reaction, results, in, hydrogen, gas, and, tm, oh, 3, exhibiting, a, fading, reddish, color, combination, of, thulium, and, chalcogens, results, in, thulium, chalcogenides, thulium, reacts, with, hydrogen, chloride, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, and, thulium, chloride, with, nitric, acid, it, yields, thulium, nitrate, or, tm, no, 3, 3, the, isotopes, of, thulium, range, from, 144, tm, to, 183, tm, the, primary, decay, mode, before, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 169, tm, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, emission, the, primary, decay, products, before, 169, tm, are, element, 68, erbium, isotopes, and, the, primary, products, after, are, element, 70, ytterbium, isotopes, thulium, 169, is, thulium, s, only, primordial, isotope, and, is, the, only, isotope, of, thulium, that, is, thought, to, be, stable, it, is, predicted, to, undergo, alpha, decay, to, holmium, 165, with, a, very, long, half, life, the, longest, lived, radioisotopes, are, thulium, 171, which, has, a, half, life, of, 1, 92, years, and, thulium, 170, which, has, a, half, life, of, 128, 6, days, most, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, a, few, minutes, or, less, in, total, 40, isotopes, and, 26, nuclear, isomers, of, thulium, have, been, detected, most, isotopes, of, thulium, lighter, than, 169, atomic, mass, units, decay, via, electron, capture, or, beta, plus, decay, although, some, exhibit, significant, alpha, decay, or, proton, emission, heavier, isotopes, undergo, beta, minus, decay, thulium, was, discovered, by, swedish, chemist, per, teodor, cleve, in, 1879, by, looking, for, impurities, in, the, oxides, of, other, rare, earth, elements, this, was, the, same, method, carl, gustaf, mosander, earlier, used, to, discover, some, other, rare, earth, elements, cleve, started, by, removing, all, of, the, known, contaminants, of, erbia, er, 2, o, 3, upon, additional, processing, he, obtained, two, new, substances, one, brown, and, one, green, the, brown, substance, was, the, oxide, of, the, element, holmium, and, was, named, holmia, by, cleve, and, the, green, substance, was, the, oxide, of, an, unknown, element, cleve, named, the, oxide, thulia, and, its, element, thulium, after, thule, an, ancient, greek, place, name, associated, with, scandinavia, or, iceland, thulium, s, atomic, symbol, was, initially, tu, but, later, changed, to, tm, thulium, was, so, rare, that, none, of, the, early, workers, had, enough, of, it, to, purify, sufficiently, to, actually, see, the, green, color, they, had, to, be, content, with, spectroscopically, observing, the, strengthening, of, the, two, characteristic, absorption, bands, as, erbium, was, progressively, removed, the, first, researcher, to, obtain, nearly, pure, thulium, was, charles, james, a, british, expatriate, working, on, a, large, scale, at, new, hampshire, college, in, durham, usa, in, 1911, he, reported, his, results, having, used, his, discovered, method, of, bromate, fractional, crystallization, to, do, the, purification, he, famously, needed, 15, 000, purification, operations, to, establish, that, the, material, was, homogeneous, high, purity, thulium, oxide, was, first, offered, commercially, in, the, late, 1950s, as, a, result, of, the, adoption, of, ion, exchange, separation, technology, lindsay, chemical, division, of, american, potash, chemical, corporation, offered, it, in, grades, of, 99, and, 99, 9, purity, the, price, per, kilogram, oscillated, between, us, 4, 600, and, 13, 300, in, the, period, from, 1959, to, 1998, for, 99, 9, purity, and, it, was, the, second, highest, for, the, lanthanides, behind, lutetium, the, element, is, never, found, in, nature, in, pure, form, but, it, is, found, in, small, quantities, in, minerals, with, other, rare, earths, thulium, is, often, found, with, minerals, containing, yttrium, and, gadolinium, in, particular, thulium, occurs, in, the, mineral, gadolinite, however, like, many, other, lanthanides, thulium, also, occurs, in, the, minerals, monazite, xenotime, and, euxenite, thulium, has, not, been, found, in, prevalence, over, the, other, rare, earths, in, any, mineral, yet, its, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, 0, 5, mg, kg, by, weight, thulium, makes, up, approximately, 0, 5, parts, per, million, of, soil, although, this, value, can, range, from, 0, 4, to, 0, 8, parts, per, million, thulium, makes, up, 250, parts, per, quadrillion, of, seawater, in, the, solar, system, thulium, exists, in, concentrations, of, 200, parts, per, trillion, by, weight, and, 1, part, per, trillion, by, moles, thulium, ore, occurs, most, commonly, in, china, however, australia, brazil, greenland, india, tanzania, and, the, united, states, also, have, large, reserves, of, thulium, total, reserves, of, thulium, are, approximately, 100, 000, tonnes, thulium, is, the, least, abundant, lanthanide, on, earth, except, for, the, radioactive, promethium, thulium, is, principally, extracted, from, monazite, ores, 0, 007, thulium, found, in, river, sands, through, ion, exchange, newer, ion, exchange, and, solvent, extraction, techniques, have, led, to, easier, separation, of, the, rare, earths, which, has, yielded, much, lower, costs, for, thulium, production, the, principal, sources, today, are, the, ion, adsorption, clays, of, southern, china, in, these, where, about, two, thirds, of, the, total, rare, earth, content, is, yttrium, thulium, is, about, 0, 5, or, about, tied, with, lutetium, for, rarity, the, metal, can, be, isolated, through, reduction, of, its, oxide, with, lanthanum, metal, or, by, calcium, reduction, in, a, closed, container, none, of, thulium, s, natural, compounds, are, commercially, important, approximately, 50, tonnes, per, year, of, thulium, oxide, are, produced, in, 1996, thulium, oxide, cost, us, 20, per, gram, and, in, 2005, 99, pure, thulium, metal, powder, cost, us, 70, per, gram, holmium, chromium, thulium, triple, doped, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, ho, cr, tm, yag, or, ho, cr, tm, yag, is, an, active, laser, medium, material, with, high, efficiency, it, lases, at, 2080, nm, in, the, infrared, and, is, widely, used, in, military, applications, medicine, and, meteorology, single, element, thulium, doped, yag, tm, yag, lasers, operate, at, 2010, nm, the, wavelength, of, thulium, based, lasers, is, very, efficient, for, superficial, ablation, of, tissue, with, minimal, coagulation, depth, in, air, or, in, water, this, makes, thulium, lasers, attractive, for, laser, based, surgery, despite, its, high, cost, portable, x, ray, devices, use, thulium, that, has, been, bombarded, with, neutrons, in, a, nuclear, reactor, to, produce, the, isotope, thulium, 170, having, a, half, life, of, 128, 6, days, and, five, major, emission, lines, of, comparable, intensity, at, 7, 4, 51, 354, 52, 389, 59, 4, and, 84, 253, kev, these, radioactive, sources, have, a, useful, life, of, about, one, year, as, tools, in, medical, and, dental, diagnosis, as, well, as, to, detect, defects, in, inaccessible, mechanical, and, electronic, components, such, sources, do, not, need, extensive, radiation, protection, only, a, small, cup, of, lead, they, are, among, the, most, popular, radiation, sources, for, use, in, industrial, radiography, thulium, 170, is, gaining, popularity, as, an, x, ray, source, for, cancer, treatment, via, brachytherapy, sealed, source, radiation, therapy, thulium, has, been, used, in, high, temperature, superconductors, similarly, to, yttrium, thulium, potentially, has, use, in, ferrites, ceramic, magnetic, materials, that, are, used, in, microwave, equipment, thulium, is, also, similar, to, scandium, in, that, it, is, used, in, arc, lighting, for, its, unusual, spectrum, in, this, case, its, green, emission, lines, which, are, not, covered, by, other, elements, because, thulium, fluoresces, with, a, blue, color, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, thulium, is, put, into, euro, banknotes, as, a, measure, against, counterfeiting, the, blue, fluorescence, of, tm, doped, calcium, sulfate, has, been, used, in, personal, dosimeters, for, visual, monitoring, of, radiation, tm, doped, halides, in, which, tm, is, in, its, 2, oxidation, state, are, luminescent, materials, that, are, proposed, for, electric, power, generating, windows, based, on, the, principle, of, a, luminescent, solar, concentrator, soluble, thulium, salts, are, mildly, toxic, but, insoluble, thulium, salts, are, completely, nontoxic, when, injected, thulium, can, cause, degeneration, of, the, liver, and, spleen, and, can, also, cause, hemoglobin, concentration, to, fluctuate, liver, damage, from, thulium, is, more, prevalent, in, male, mice, than, female, mice, despite, this, thulium, has, a, low, level, of, toxicity, in, humans, thulium, occurs, in, the, highest, amounts, in, the, liver, kidneys, and, bones, humans, typically, consume, several, micrograms, of, thulium, per, year, the, roots, of, plants, do, not, take, up, thulium, and, the, dry, matter, of, vegetables, usually, contains, one, part, per, billion, of, thulium, thulium, is, toxic, thulium, dust, can, cause, explosions, and, fires
