the, greenhouse, effect, occurs, when, greenhouse, gases, in, a, planet, s, atmosphere, insulate, the, planet, from, losing, heat, to, space, raising, its, surface, temperature, surface, heating, can, happen, from, an, internal, heat, source, as, in, the, case, of, jupiter, or, from, its, host, star, as, in, the, case, of, the, earth, in, the, case, of, earth, the, sun, emits, shortwave, radiation, sunlight, that, passes, through, greenhouse, gases, to, heat, the, earth, s, surface, in, response, the, earth, s, surface, emits, longwave, radiation, that, is, mostly, absorbed, by, greenhouse, gases, the, absorption, of, longwave, radiation, prevents, it, from, reaching, space, reducing, the, rate, at, which, the, earth, can, cool, off, without, the, greenhouse, effect, the, earth, s, average, surface, temperature, would, be, about, 18, c, 0, 4, f, compared, to, the, 20th, century, average, of, about, 14, c, 57, f, or, a, more, recent, average, of, about, 15, c, 59, f, in, addition, to, naturally, present, greenhouse, gases, burning, of, fossil, fuels, has, increased, amounts, of, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, in, the, atmosphere, as, a, result, global, warming, of, about, 1, 2, c, 2, 2, f, has, occurred, since, the, industrial, revolution, with, the, global, average, surface, temperature, increasing, at, a, rate, of, 0, 18, c, 0, 32, f, per, decade, since, 1981, all, objects, with, a, temperature, above, absolute, zero, emit, thermal, radiation, the, wavelengths, of, thermal, radiation, emitted, by, the, sun, and, earth, differ, because, their, surface, temperatures, are, different, the, sun, has, a, surface, temperature, of, 5, 500, c, 9, 900, f, so, it, emits, most, of, its, energy, as, shortwave, radiation, in, near, infrared, and, visible, wavelengths, as, sunlight, in, contrast, earth, s, surface, has, a, much, lower, temperature, so, it, emits, longwave, radiation, at, mid, and, far, infrared, wavelengths, a, gas, is, a, greenhouse, gas, if, it, absorbs, longwave, radiation, earth, s, atmosphere, absorbs, only, 23, of, incoming, shortwave, radiation, but, absorbs, 90, of, the, longwave, radiation, emitted, by, the, surface, thus, accumulating, energy, and, warming, the, earth, s, surface, the, existence, of, the, greenhouse, effect, while, not, named, as, such, was, proposed, as, early, as, 1824, by, joseph, fourier, the, argument, and, the, evidence, were, further, strengthened, by, claude, pouillet, in, 1827, and, 1838, in, 1856, eunice, newton, foote, demonstrated, that, the, warming, effect, of, the, sun, is, greater, for, air, with, water, vapour, than, for, dry, air, and, the, effect, is, even, greater, with, carbon, dioxide, the, term, greenhouse, was, first, applied, to, this, phenomenon, by, nils, gustaf, ekholm, in, 1901, the, greenhouse, effect, on, earth, is, defined, as, the, infrared, radiative, effect, of, all, infrared, absorbing, constituents, in, the, atmosphere, greenhouse, gases, ghgs, clouds, and, some, aerosols, absorb, terrestrial, radiation, emitted, by, the, earth, s, surface, and, elsewhere, in, the, atmosphere, 2232, the, enhanced, greenhouse, effect, describes, the, fact, that, by, increasing, the, concentration, of, ghgs, in, the, atmosphere, due, to, human, action, the, natural, greenhouse, effect, is, increased, 2232, the, term, greenhouse, effect, comes, from, an, analogy, to, greenhouses, both, greenhouses, and, the, greenhouse, effect, work, by, retaining, heat, from, sunlight, but, the, way, they, retain, heat, differs, greenhouses, retain, heat, mainly, by, blocking, convection, the, movement, of, air, in, contrast, the, greenhouse, effect, retains, heat, by, restricting, radiative, transfer, through, the, air, and, reducing, the, rate, at, which, thermal, radiation, is, emitted, into, space, the, existence, of, the, greenhouse, effect, while, not, named, as, such, was, proposed, as, early, as, 1824, by, joseph, fourier, the, argument, and, the, evidence, were, further, strengthened, by, claude, pouillet, in, 1827, and, 1838, in, 1856, eunice, newton, foote, demonstrated, that, the, warming, effect, of, the, sun, is, greater, for, air, with, water, vapour, than, for, dry, air, and, the, effect, is, even, greater, with, carbon, dioxide, she, concluded, that, an, atmosphere, of, that, gas, would, give, to, our, earth, a, high, temperature, john, tyndall, was, the, first, to, measure, the, infrared, absorption, and, emission, of, various, gases, and, vapors, from, 1859, onwards, he, showed, that, the, effect, was, due, to, a, very, small, proportion, of, the, atmosphere, with, the, main, gases, having, no, effect, and, was, largely, due, to, water, vapor, though, small, percentages, of, hydrocarbons, and, carbon, dioxide, had, a, significant, effect, the, effect, was, more, fully, quantified, by, svante, arrhenius, in, 1896, who, made, the, first, quantitative, prediction, of, global, warming, due, to, a, hypothetical, doubling, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, the, term, greenhouse, was, first, applied, to, this, phenomenon, by, nils, gustaf, ekholm, in, 1901, matter, emits, thermal, radiation, at, a, rate, that, is, directly, proportional, to, the, fourth, power, of, its, temperature, some, of, the, radiation, emitted, by, the, earth, s, surface, is, absorbed, by, greenhouse, gases, and, clouds, without, this, absorption, earth, s, surface, would, have, an, average, temperature, of, 18, c, 0, 4, f, however, because, some, of, the, radiation, is, absorbed, earth, s, average, surface, temperature, is, around, 15, c, 59, f, thus, the, earth, s, greenhouse, effect, may, be, measured, as, a, temperature, change, of, 33, c, 59, f, thermal, radiation, is, characterized, by, how, much, energy, it, carries, typically, in, watts, per, square, meter, w, m, 2, scientists, also, measure, the, greenhouse, effect, based, on, how, much, more, longwave, thermal, radiation, leaves, the, earth, s, surface, than, reaches, space, 968, 934, currently, longwave, radiation, leaves, the, surface, at, an, average, rate, of, 398, w, m, 2, but, only, 239, w, m, 2, reaches, space, thus, the, earth, s, greenhouse, effect, can, also, be, measured, as, an, energy, flow, change, of, 159, w, m, 2, 968, 934, the, greenhouse, effect, can, be, expressed, as, a, fraction, 0, 40, or, percentage, 40, of, the, longwave, thermal, radiation, that, leaves, earth, s, surface, but, does, not, reach, space, 968, whether, the, greenhouse, effect, is, expressed, as, a, change, in, temperature, or, as, a, change, in, longwave, thermal, radiation, the, same, effect, is, being, measured, strengthening, of, the, greenhouse, effect, through, additional, greenhouse, gases, from, human, activities, is, known, as, the, enhanced, greenhouse, effect, 2232, as, well, as, being, inferred, from, measurements, by, argo, ceres, and, other, instruments, throughout, the, 21st, century, 7, 17, this, increase, in, radiative, forcing, from, human, activity, has, been, observed, directly, and, is, attributable, mainly, to, increased, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, levels, co, 2, is, produced, by, fossil, fuel, burning, and, other, activities, such, as, cement, production, and, tropical, deforestation, measurements, of, co, 2, from, the, mauna, loa, observatory, show, that, concentrations, have, increased, from, about, 313, parts, per, million, ppm, in, 1960, passing, the, 400, ppm, milestone, in, 2013, the, current, observed, amount, of, co, 2, exceeds, the, geological, record, maxima, 300, ppm, from, ice, core, data, over, the, past, 800, 000, years, ice, core, data, shows, that, carbon, dioxide, has, varied, from, values, as, low, as, 180, ppm, to, the, pre, industrial, level, of, 270, ppm, paleoclimatologists, consider, variations, in, carbon, dioxide, concentration, to, be, a, fundamental, factor, influencing, climate, variations, over, this, time, scale, hotter, matter, emits, shorter, wavelengths, of, radiation, as, a, result, the, sun, emits, shortwave, radiation, as, sunlight, while, the, earth, and, its, atmosphere, emit, longwave, radiation, sunlight, includes, ultraviolet, visible, light, and, near, infrared, radiation, 2251, sunlight, is, reflected, and, absorbed, by, the, earth, and, its, atmosphere, the, atmosphere, and, clouds, reflect, about, 23, and, absorb, 23, the, surface, reflects, 7, and, absorbs, 48, overall, earth, reflects, about, 30, of, the, incoming, sunlight, and, absorbs, the, rest, 240, w, m, 2, 934, the, earth, and, its, atmosphere, emit, longwave, radiation, also, known, as, thermal, infrared, or, terrestrial, radiation, 2251, informally, longwave, radiation, is, sometimes, called, thermal, radiation, outgoing, longwave, radiation, olr, is, the, radiation, from, earth, and, its, atmosphere, that, passes, through, the, atmosphere, and, into, space, the, greenhouse, effect, can, be, directly, seen, in, graphs, of, earth, s, outgoing, longwave, radiation, as, a, function, of, frequency, or, wavelength, the, area, between, the, curve, for, longwave, radiation, emitted, by, earth, s, surface, and, the, curve, for, outgoing, longwave, radiation, indicates, the, size, of, the, greenhouse, effect, different, substances, are, responsible, for, reducing, the, radiation, energy, reaching, space, at, different, frequencies, for, some, frequencies, multiple, substances, play, a, role, carbon, dioxide, is, understood, to, be, responsible, for, the, dip, in, outgoing, radiation, and, associated, rise, in, the, greenhouse, effect, at, around, 667, cm, 1, equivalent, to, a, wavelength, of, 15, microns, each, layer, of, the, atmosphere, with, greenhouse, gases, absorbs, some, of, the, longwave, radiation, being, radiated, upwards, from, lower, layers, it, also, emits, longwave, radiation, in, all, directions, both, upwards, and, downwards, in, equilibrium, with, the, amount, it, has, absorbed, this, results, in, less, radiative, heat, loss, and, more, warmth, below, increasing, the, concentration, of, the, gases, increases, the, amount, of, absorption, and, emission, and, thereby, causing, more, heat, to, be, retained, at, the, surface, and, in, the, layers, below, the, power, of, outgoing, longwave, radiation, emitted, by, a, planet, corresponds, to, the, effective, temperature, of, the, planet, the, effective, temperature, is, the, temperature, that, a, planet, radiating, with, a, uniform, temperature, a, blackbody, would, need, to, have, in, order, to, radiate, the, same, amount, of, energy, this, concept, may, be, used, to, compare, the, amount, of, longwave, radiation, emitted, to, space, and, the, amount, of, longwave, radiation, emitted, by, the, surface, earth, s, surface, temperature, is, often, reported, in, terms, of, the, average, near, surface, air, temperature, this, is, about, 15, c, 59, f, a, bit, lower, than, the, effective, surface, temperature, this, value, is, 33, c, 59, f, warmer, than, earth, s, overall, effective, temperature, energy, flux, is, the, rate, of, energy, flow, per, unit, area, energy, flux, is, expressed, in, units, of, w, m, 2, which, is, the, number, of, joules, of, energy, that, pass, through, a, square, meter, each, second, most, fluxes, quoted, in, high, level, discussions, of, climate, are, global, values, which, means, they, are, the, total, flow, of, energy, over, the, entire, globe, divided, by, the, surface, area, of, the, earth, 5, 1, 10, 14, m, 2, 5, 1, 10, 8, km, 2, 2, 0, 10, 8, sq, mi, the, fluxes, of, radiation, arriving, at, and, leaving, the, earth, are, important, because, radiative, transfer, is, the, only, process, capable, of, exchanging, energy, between, earth, and, the, rest, of, the, universe, 145, the, temperature, of, a, planet, depends, on, the, balance, between, incoming, radiation, and, outgoing, radiation, if, incoming, radiation, exceeds, outgoing, radiation, a, planet, will, warm, if, outgoing, radiation, exceeds, incoming, radiation, a, planet, will, cool, a, planet, will, tend, towards, a, state, of, radiative, equilibrium, in, which, the, power, of, outgoing, radiation, equals, the, power, of, absorbed, incoming, radiation, earth, s, energy, imbalance, is, the, amount, by, which, the, power, of, incoming, sunlight, absorbed, by, earth, s, surface, or, atmosphere, exceeds, the, power, of, outgoing, longwave, radiation, emitted, to, space, energy, imbalance, is, the, fundamental, measurement, that, drives, surface, temperature, a, un, presentation, says, the, eei, is, the, most, critical, number, defining, the, prospects, for, continued, global, warming, and, climate, change, one, study, argues, the, absolute, value, of, eei, represents, the, most, fundamental, metric, defining, the, status, of, global, climate, change, earth, s, energy, imbalance, eei, was, about, 0, 7, w, m, 2, as, of, around, 2015, indicating, that, earth, as, a, whole, is, accumulating, thermal, energy, and, is, in, a, process, of, becoming, warmer, 934, over, 90, of, the, retained, energy, goes, into, warming, the, oceans, with, much, smaller, amounts, going, into, heating, the, land, atmosphere, and, ice, a, simple, picture, assumes, a, steady, state, but, in, the, real, world, the, day, night, diurnal, cycle, as, well, as, the, seasonal, cycle, and, weather, disturbances, complicate, matters, solar, heating, applies, only, during, daytime, at, night, the, atmosphere, cools, somewhat, but, not, greatly, because, the, thermal, inertia, of, the, climate, system, resists, changes, both, day, and, night, as, well, as, for, longer, periods, diurnal, temperature, changes, decrease, with, height, in, the, atmosphere, in, the, lower, portion, of, the, atmosphere, the, troposphere, the, air, temperature, decreases, or, lapses, with, increasing, altitude, the, rate, at, which, temperature, changes, with, altitude, is, called, the, lapse, rate, on, earth, the, air, temperature, decreases, by, about, 6, 5, c, km, 3, 6, f, per, 1000, ft, on, average, although, this, varies, the, temperature, lapse, is, caused, by, convection, air, warmed, by, the, surface, rises, as, it, rises, air, expands, and, cools, simultaneously, other, air, descends, compresses, and, warms, this, process, creates, a, vertical, temperature, gradient, within, the, atmosphere, this, vertical, temperature, gradient, is, essential, to, the, greenhouse, effect, if, the, lapse, rate, was, zero, so, that, the, atmospheric, temperature, did, not, vary, with, altitude, and, was, the, same, as, the, surface, temperature, then, there, would, be, no, greenhouse, effect, i, e, its, value, would, be, zero, greenhouse, gases, make, the, atmosphere, near, earth, s, surface, mostly, opaque, to, longwave, radiation, the, atmosphere, only, becomes, transparent, to, longwave, radiation, at, higher, altitudes, where, the, air, is, less, dense, there, is, less, water, vapor, and, reduced, pressure, broadening, of, absorption, lines, limits, the, wavelengths, that, gas, molecules, can, absorb, for, any, given, wavelength, the, longwave, radiation, that, reaches, space, is, emitted, by, a, particular, radiating, layer, of, the, atmosphere, the, intensity, of, the, emitted, radiation, is, determined, by, the, weighted, average, air, temperature, within, that, layer, so, for, any, given, wavelength, of, radiation, emitted, to, space, there, is, an, associated, effective, emission, temperature, or, brightness, temperature, a, given, wavelength, of, radiation, may, also, be, said, to, have, an, effective, emission, altitude, which, is, a, weighted, average, of, the, altitudes, within, the, radiating, layer, the, effective, emission, temperature, and, altitude, vary, by, wavelength, or, frequency, this, phenomenon, may, be, seen, by, examining, plots, of, radiation, emitted, to, space, earth, s, surface, radiates, longwave, radiation, with, wavelengths, in, the, range, of, 4, 100, microns, greenhouse, gases, that, were, largely, transparent, to, incoming, solar, radiation, are, more, absorbent, for, some, wavelengths, in, this, range, the, atmosphere, near, the, earth, s, surface, is, largely, opaque, to, longwave, radiation, and, most, heat, loss, from, the, surface, is, by, evaporation, and, convection, however, radiative, energy, losses, become, increasingly, important, higher, in, the, atmosphere, largely, because, of, the, decreasing, concentration, of, water, vapor, an, important, greenhouse, gas, rather, than, thinking, of, longwave, radiation, headed, to, space, as, coming, from, the, surface, itself, it, is, more, realistic, to, think, of, this, outgoing, radiation, as, being, emitted, by, a, layer, in, the, mid, troposphere, which, is, effectively, coupled, to, the, surface, by, a, lapse, rate, the, difference, in, temperature, between, these, two, locations, explains, the, difference, between, surface, emissions, and, emissions, to, space, i, e, it, explains, the, greenhouse, effect, a, greenhouse, gas, ghg, is, a, gas, which, contributes, to, the, trapping, of, heat, by, impeding, the, flow, of, longwave, radiation, out, of, a, planet, s, atmosphere, greenhouse, gases, contribute, most, of, the, greenhouse, effect, in, earth, s, energy, budget, gases, which, can, absorb, and, emit, longwave, radiation, are, said, to, be, infrared, active, and, act, as, greenhouse, gases, most, gases, whose, molecules, have, two, different, atoms, such, as, carbon, monoxide, co, and, all, gases, with, three, or, more, atoms, including, h, 2, o, and, co, 2, are, infrared, active, and, act, as, greenhouse, gases, technically, this, is, because, when, these, molecules, vibrate, those, vibrations, modify, the, molecular, dipole, moment, or, asymmetry, in, the, distribution, of, electrical, charge, see, infrared, spectroscopy, gases, with, only, one, atom, such, as, argon, ar, or, with, two, identical, atoms, such, as, nitrogen, n, 2, and, oxygen, o, 2, are, not, infrared, active, they, are, transparent, to, longwave, radiation, and, for, practical, purposes, do, not, absorb, or, emit, longwave, radiation, this, is, because, their, molecules, are, symmetrical, and, so, do, not, have, a, dipole, moment, such, gases, make, up, more, than, 99, of, the, dry, atmosphere, greenhouse, gases, absorb, and, emit, longwave, radiation, within, specific, ranges, of, wavelengths, organized, as, spectral, lines, or, bands, when, greenhouse, gases, absorb, radiation, they, distribute, the, acquired, energy, to, the, surrounding, air, as, thermal, energy, i, e, kinetic, energy, of, gas, molecules, energy, is, transferred, from, greenhouse, gas, molecules, to, other, molecules, via, molecular, collisions, contrary, to, what, is, sometimes, said, greenhouse, gases, do, not, re, emit, photons, after, they, are, absorbed, because, each, molecule, experiences, billions, of, collisions, per, second, any, energy, a, greenhouse, gas, molecule, receives, by, absorbing, a, photon, will, be, redistributed, to, other, molecules, before, there, is, a, chance, for, a, new, photon, to, be, emitted, in, a, separate, process, greenhouse, gases, emit, longwave, radiation, at, a, rate, determined, by, the, air, temperature, this, thermal, energy, is, either, absorbed, by, other, greenhouse, gas, molecules, or, leaves, the, atmosphere, cooling, it, effect, on, air, air, is, warmed, by, latent, heat, buoyant, water, vapor, condensing, into, water, droplets, and, releasing, heat, thermals, warm, air, rising, from, below, and, by, sunlight, being, absorbed, in, the, atmosphere, air, is, cooled, radiatively, by, greenhouse, gases, and, clouds, emitting, longwave, thermal, radiation, within, the, troposphere, greenhouse, gases, typically, have, a, net, cooling, effect, on, air, emitting, more, thermal, radiation, than, they, absorb, warming, and, cooling, of, air, are, well, balanced, on, average, so, that, the, atmosphere, maintains, a, roughly, stable, average, temperature, 139, effect, on, surface, cooling, longwave, radiation, flows, both, upward, and, downward, due, to, absorption, and, emission, in, the, atmosphere, these, canceling, energy, flows, reduce, radiative, surface, cooling, net, upward, radiative, energy, flow, latent, heat, transport, and, thermals, provide, non, radiative, surface, cooling, which, partially, compensates, for, this, reduction, but, there, is, still, a, net, reduction, in, surface, cooling, for, a, given, surface, temperature, 139, effect, on, toa, energy, balance, greenhouse, gases, impact, the, top, of, atmosphere, toa, energy, budget, by, reducing, the, flux, of, longwave, radiation, emitted, to, space, for, a, given, surface, temperature, thus, greenhouse, gases, alter, the, energy, balance, at, toa, this, means, that, the, surface, temperature, needs, to, be, higher, than, the, planet, s, effective, temperature, i, e, the, temperature, associated, with, emissions, to, space, in, order, for, the, outgoing, energy, emitted, to, space, to, balance, the, incoming, energy, from, sunlight, 139, it, is, important, to, focus, on, the, top, of, atmosphere, toa, energy, budget, rather, than, the, surface, energy, budget, when, reasoning, about, the, warming, effect, of, greenhouse, gases, 414, clouds, and, aerosols, have, both, cooling, effects, associated, with, reflecting, sunlight, back, to, space, and, warming, effects, associated, with, trapping, thermal, radiation, on, average, clouds, have, a, strong, net, cooling, effect, however, the, mix, of, cooling, and, warming, effects, varies, depending, on, detailed, characteristics, of, particular, clouds, including, their, type, height, and, optical, properties, thin, cirrus, clouds, can, have, a, net, warming, effect, clouds, can, absorb, and, emit, infrared, radiation, and, thus, affect, the, radiative, properties, of, the, atmosphere, while, the, radiative, forcing, due, to, greenhouse, gases, may, be, determined, to, a, reasonably, high, degree, of, accuracy, the, uncertainties, relating, to, aerosol, radiative, forcings, remain, large, and, rely, to, a, large, extent, on, the, estimates, from, global, modeling, studies, that, are, difficult, to, verify, at, the, present, time, a, given, flux, of, thermal, radiation, has, an, associated, effective, radiating, temperature, or, effective, temperature, effective, temperature, is, the, temperature, that, a, black, body, a, perfect, absorber, emitter, would, need, to, be, to, emit, that, much, thermal, radiation, thus, the, overall, effective, temperature, of, a, planet, is, given, by, where, olr, is, the, average, flux, power, per, unit, area, of, outgoing, longwave, radiation, emitted, to, space, and, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stefan, boltzmann, constant, similarly, the, effective, temperature, of, the, surface, is, given, by, where, slr, is, the, average, flux, of, longwave, radiation, emitted, by, the, surface, olr, is, a, conventional, abbreviation, slr, is, used, here, to, denote, the, flux, of, surface, emitted, longwave, radiation, although, there, is, no, standard, abbreviation, for, this, the, ipcc, reports, the, greenhouse, effect, g, as, being, 159, w, m, 2, where, g, is, the, flux, of, longwave, thermal, radiation, that, leaves, the, surface, minus, the, flux, of, outgoing, longwave, radiation, that, reaches, space, 968, alternatively, the, greenhouse, effect, can, be, described, using, the, normalized, greenhouse, effect, g, defined, as, the, normalized, greenhouse, effect, is, the, fraction, of, the, amount, of, thermal, radiation, emitted, by, the, surface, that, does, not, reach, space, based, on, the, ipcc, numbers, g, 0, 40, in, other, words, 40, percent, less, thermal, radiation, reaches, space, than, what, leaves, the, surface, 968, sometimes, the, greenhouse, effect, is, quantified, as, a, temperature, difference, this, temperature, difference, is, closely, related, to, the, quantities, above, when, the, greenhouse, effect, is, expressed, as, a, temperature, difference, t, g, h, e, displaystyle, delta, t, mathrm, ghe, this, refers, to, the, effective, temperature, associated, with, thermal, radiation, emissions, from, the, surface, minus, the, effective, temperature, associated, with, emissions, to, space, informal, discussions, of, the, greenhouse, effect, often, compare, the, actual, surface, temperature, to, the, temperature, that, the, planet, would, have, if, there, were, no, greenhouse, gases, however, in, formal, technical, discussions, when, the, size, of, the, greenhouse, effect, is, quantified, as, a, temperature, this, is, generally, done, using, the, above, formula, the, formula, refers, to, the, effective, surface, temperature, rather, than, the, actual, surface, temperature, and, compares, the, surface, with, the, top, of, the, atmosphere, rather, than, comparing, reality, to, a, hypothetical, situation, the, temperature, difference, t, g, h, e, displaystyle, delta, t, mathrm, ghe, indicates, how, much, warmer, a, planet, s, surface, is, than, the, planet, s, overall, effective, temperature, earth, s, top, of, atmosphere, toa, energy, imbalance, eei, is, the, amount, by, which, the, power, of, incoming, radiation, exceeds, the, power, of, outgoing, radiation, where, asr, is, the, mean, flux, of, absorbed, solar, radiation, asr, may, be, expanded, as, where, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, albedo, reflectivity, of, the, planet, and, msi, is, the, mean, solar, irradiance, incoming, at, the, top, of, the, atmosphere, the, radiative, equilibrium, temperature, of, a, planet, can, be, expressed, as, a, planet, s, temperature, will, tend, to, shift, towards, a, state, of, radiative, equilibrium, in, which, the, toa, energy, imbalance, is, zero, i, e, e, e, i, 0, displaystyle, mathrm, eei, 0, when, the, planet, is, in, radiative, equilibrium, the, overall, effective, temperature, of, the, planet, is, given, by, thus, the, concept, of, radiative, equilibrium, is, important, because, it, indicates, what, effective, temperature, a, planet, will, tend, towards, having, if, in, addition, to, knowing, the, effective, temperature, t, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, eff, we, know, the, value, of, the, greenhouse, effect, then, we, know, the, mean, average, surface, temperature, of, the, planet, this, is, why, the, quantity, known, as, the, greenhouse, effect, is, important, it, is, one, of, the, few, quantities, that, go, into, determining, the, planet, s, mean, surface, temperature, typically, a, planet, will, be, close, to, radiative, equilibrium, with, the, rates, of, incoming, and, outgoing, energy, being, well, balanced, under, such, conditions, the, planet, s, equilibrium, temperature, is, determined, by, the, mean, solar, irradiance, and, the, planetary, albedo, how, much, sunlight, is, reflected, back, to, space, instead, of, being, absorbed, the, greenhouse, effect, measures, how, much, warmer, the, surface, is, than, the, overall, effective, temperature, of, the, planet, so, the, effective, surface, temperature, t, s, u, r, f, a, c, e, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, surface, eff, is, using, the, definition, of, t, g, h, e, displaystyle, delta, t, mathrm, ghe, one, could, also, express, the, relationship, between, t, s, u, r, f, a, c, e, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, surface, eff, and, t, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, eff, using, g, or, g, so, the, principle, that, a, larger, greenhouse, effect, corresponds, to, a, higher, surface, temperature, if, everything, else, i, e, the, factors, that, determine, t, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, eff, is, held, fixed, is, true, as, a, matter, of, definition, note, that, the, greenhouse, effect, influences, the, temperature, of, the, planet, as, a, whole, in, tandem, with, the, planet, s, tendency, to, move, toward, radiative, equilibrium, there, are, sometimes, misunderstandings, about, how, the, greenhouse, effect, functions, and, raises, temperatures, the, surface, budget, fallacy, is, a, common, error, in, thinking, 413, it, involves, thinking, that, an, increased, co, 2, concentration, could, only, cause, warming, by, increasing, the, downward, thermal, radiation, to, the, surface, as, a, result, of, making, the, atmosphere, a, better, emitter, if, the, atmosphere, near, the, surface, is, already, nearly, opaque, to, thermal, radiation, this, would, mean, that, increasing, co, 2, could, not, lead, to, higher, temperatures, however, it, is, a, mistake, to, focus, on, the, surface, energy, budget, rather, than, the, top, of, atmosphere, energy, budget, regardless, of, what, happens, at, the, surface, increasing, the, concentration, of, co, 2, tends, to, reduce, the, thermal, radiation, reaching, space, olr, leading, to, a, toa, energy, imbalance, that, leads, to, warming, earlier, researchers, like, callendar, 1938, and, plass, 1959, focused, on, the, surface, budget, but, the, work, of, manabe, in, the, 1960s, clarified, the, importance, of, the, top, of, atmosphere, energy, budget, 414, among, those, who, do, not, believe, in, the, greenhouse, effect, there, is, a, fallacy, that, the, greenhouse, effect, involves, greenhouse, gases, sending, heat, from, the, cool, atmosphere, to, the, planet, s, warm, surface, in, violation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, however, this, idea, reflects, a, misunderstanding, radiation, heat, flow, is, the, net, energy, flow, after, the, flows, of, radiation, in, both, directions, have, been, taken, into, account, radiation, heat, flow, occurs, in, the, direction, from, the, surface, to, the, atmosphere, and, space, as, is, to, be, expected, given, that, the, surface, is, warmer, than, the, atmosphere, and, space, while, greenhouse, gases, emit, thermal, radiation, downward, to, the, surface, this, is, part, of, the, normal, process, of, radiation, heat, transfer, the, downward, thermal, radiation, simply, reduces, the, upward, thermal, radiation, net, energy, flow, radiation, heat, flow, i, e, it, reduces, cooling, simplified, models, are, sometimes, used, to, support, understanding, of, how, the, greenhouse, effect, comes, about, and, how, this, affects, surface, temperature, the, greenhouse, effect, can, be, seen, to, occur, in, a, simplified, model, in, which, the, air, is, treated, as, if, it, is, single, uniform, layer, exchanging, radiation, with, the, ground, and, space, slightly, more, complex, models, add, additional, layers, or, introduce, convection, one, simplification, is, to, treat, all, outgoing, longwave, radiation, as, being, emitted, from, an, altitude, where, the, air, temperature, equals, the, overall, effective, temperature, for, planetary, emissions, t, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, eff, some, authors, have, referred, to, this, altitude, as, the, effective, radiating, level, erl, and, suggest, that, as, the, co, 2, concentration, increases, the, erl, must, rise, to, maintain, the, same, mass, of, co, 2, above, that, level, this, approach, is, less, accurate, than, accounting, for, variation, in, radiation, wavelength, by, emission, altitude, however, it, can, be, useful, in, supporting, a, simplified, understanding, of, the, greenhouse, effect, for, instance, it, can, be, used, to, explain, how, the, greenhouse, effect, increases, as, the, concentration, of, greenhouse, gases, increase, earth, s, overall, equivalent, emission, altitude, has, been, increasing, with, a, trend, of, 23, m, 75, ft, decade, which, is, said, to, be, consistent, with, a, global, mean, surface, warming, of, 0, 12, c, 0, 22, f, decade, over, the, period, 1979, 2011, scientists, have, observed, that, at, times, there, is, a, negative, greenhouse, effect, over, parts, of, antarctica, in, a, location, where, there, is, a, strong, temperature, inversion, so, that, the, air, is, warmer, than, the, surface, it, is, possible, for, the, greenhouse, effect, to, be, reversed, so, that, the, presence, of, greenhouse, gases, increases, the, rate, of, radiative, cooling, to, space, in, this, case, the, rate, of, thermal, radiation, emission, to, space, is, greater, than, the, rate, at, which, thermal, radiation, is, emitted, by, the, surface, thus, the, local, value, of, the, greenhouse, effect, is, negative, in, the, solar, system, apart, from, the, earth, at, least, two, other, planets, and, a, moon, also, have, a, greenhouse, effect, the, greenhouse, effect, on, venus, is, particularly, large, and, it, brings, the, surface, temperature, to, as, high, as, 735, k, 462, c, 863, f, this, is, due, to, its, very, dense, atmosphere, which, consists, of, about, 97, carbon, dioxide, although, venus, is, about, 30, closer, to, the, sun, it, absorbs, and, is, warmed, by, less, sunlight, than, earth, because, venus, reflects, 77, of, incident, sunlight, while, earth, reflects, around, 30, in, the, absence, of, a, greenhouse, effect, the, surface, of, venus, would, be, expected, to, have, a, temperature, of, 232, k, 41, c, 42, f, thus, contrary, to, what, one, might, think, being, nearer, to, the, sun, is, not, a, reason, why, venus, is, warmer, than, earth, due, to, its, high, pressure, the, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, exhibits, continuum, absorption, absorption, over, a, broad, range, of, wavelengths, and, is, not, limited, to, absorption, within, the, bands, relevant, to, its, absorption, on, earth, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, involving, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, has, for, many, years, been, hypothesized, to, have, occurred, on, venus, this, idea, is, still, largely, accepted, the, planet, venus, experienced, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, resulting, in, an, atmosphere, which, is, 96, carbon, dioxide, and, a, surface, atmospheric, pressure, roughly, the, same, as, found, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, underwater, on, earth, venus, may, have, had, water, oceans, but, they, would, have, boiled, off, as, the, mean, surface, temperature, rose, to, the, current, 735, k, 462, c, 863, f, mars, has, about, 70, times, as, much, carbon, dioxide, as, earth, but, experiences, only, a, small, greenhouse, effect, about, 6, k, 11, f, the, greenhouse, effect, is, small, due, to, the, lack, of, water, vapor, and, the, overall, thinness, of, the, atmosphere, the, same, radiative, transfer, calculations, that, predict, warming, on, earth, accurately, explain, the, temperature, on, mars, given, its, atmospheric, composition, saturn, s, moon, titan, has, both, a, greenhouse, effect, and, an, anti, greenhouse, effect, the, presence, of, nitrogen, n, 2, methane, ch, 4, and, hydrogen, h, 2, in, the, atmosphere, contribute, to, a, greenhouse, effect, increasing, the, surface, temperature, by, 21, k, 38, f, over, the, expected, temperature, of, the, body, without, these, gases, while, the, gases, n, 2, and, h, 2, ordinarily, do, not, absorb, infrared, radiation, these, gases, absorb, thermal, radiation, on, titan, due, to, pressure, induced, collisions, the, large, mass, and, thickness, of, the, atmosphere, and, the, long, wavelengths, of, the, thermal, radiation, from, the, cold, surface, the, existence, of, a, high, altitude, haze, which, absorbs, wavelengths, of, solar, radiation, but, is, transparent, to, infrared, contribute, to, an, anti, greenhouse, effect, of, approximately, 9, k, 16, f, the, net, result, of, these, two, effects, is, a, warming, of, 21, k, 9, k, 12, k, 22, f, so, titan, s, surface, temperature, of, 94, k, 179, c, 290, f, is, 12, k, warmer, than, it, would, be, if, there, were, no, atmosphere, one, cannot, predict, the, relative, sizes, of, the, greenhouse, effects, on, different, bodies, simply, by, comparing, the, amount, of, greenhouse, gases, in, their, atmospheres, this, is, because, factors, other, than, the, quantity, of, these, gases, also, play, a, role, in, determining, the, size, of, the, greenhouse, effect, overall, atmospheric, pressure, affects, how, much, thermal, radiation, each, molecule, of, a, greenhouse, gas, can, absorb, high, pressure, leads, to, more, absorption, and, low, pressure, leads, to, less, this, is, due, to, pressure, broadening, of, spectral, lines, when, the, total, atmospheric, pressure, is, higher, collisions, between, molecules, occur, at, a, higher, rate, collisions, broaden, the, width, of, absorption, lines, allowing, a, greenhouse, gas, to, absorb, thermal, radiation, over, a, broader, range, of, wavelengths, 226, each, molecule, in, the, air, near, earth, s, surface, experiences, about, 7, billion, collisions, per, second, this, rate, is, lower, at, higher, altitudes, where, the, pressure, and, temperature, are, both, lower, this, means, that, greenhouse, gases, are, able, to, absorb, more, wavelengths, in, the, lower, atmosphere, than, they, can, in, the, upper, atmosphere, on, other, planets, pressure, broadening, means, that, each, molecule, of, a, greenhouse, gas, is, more, effective, at, trapping, thermal, radiation, if, the, total, atmospheric, pressure, is, high, as, on, venus, and, less, effective, at, trapping, thermal, radiation, if, the, atmospheric, pressure, is, low, as, on, mars
