the, kelvin, symbol, k, is, the, base, unit, for, temperature, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, kelvin, scale, is, an, absolute, temperature, scale, that, starts, at, the, lowest, possible, temperature, absolute, zero, taken, to, be, 0, k, by, definition, the, celsius, scale, symbol, c, and, the, kelvin, scale, have, the, exact, same, magnitude, that, is, a, rise, of, 1, k, is, equal, to, a, rise, of, 1, c, and, vice, versa, and, any, temperature, in, degrees, celsius, can, be, converted, to, kelvin, by, adding, 273, 15, the, 19th, century, british, scientist, lord, kelvin, first, developed, and, proposed, the, scale, it, was, often, called, the, absolute, celsius, scale, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, kelvin, was, formally, added, to, the, international, system, of, units, in, 1954, defining, 273, 16, k, to, be, the, triple, point, of, water, the, celsius, fahrenheit, and, rankine, scales, were, redefined, in, terms, of, the, kelvin, scale, using, this, definition, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, now, defines, the, kelvin, in, terms, of, energy, by, setting, the, boltzmann, constant, to, exactly, 1, 380, 649, 10, 23, joules, per, kelvin, every, 1, k, change, of, thermodynamic, temperature, corresponds, to, a, thermal, energy, change, of, exactly, 1, 380, 649, 10, 23, j, during, the, 18th, century, multiple, temperature, scales, were, developed, notably, fahrenheit, and, centigrade, later, celsius, these, scales, predated, much, of, the, modern, science, of, thermodynamics, including, atomic, theory, and, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, which, underpin, the, concept, of, absolute, zero, instead, they, chose, defining, points, within, the, range, of, human, experience, that, could, be, reproduced, easily, and, with, reasonable, accuracy, but, lacked, any, deep, significance, in, thermal, physics, in, the, case, of, the, celsius, scale, and, the, long, since, defunct, newton, scale, and, r, aumur, scale, the, melting, point, of, ice, served, as, such, a, starting, point, with, celsius, being, defined, from, the, 1740s, to, the, 1940s, by, calibrating, a, thermometer, such, that, this, definition, assumes, pure, water, at, a, specific, pressure, chosen, to, approximate, the, natural, air, pressure, at, sea, level, thus, an, increment, of, 1, c, equals, 1, 100, of, the, temperature, difference, between, the, melting, and, boiling, points, the, same, temperature, interval, was, later, used, for, the, kelvin, scale, from, 1787, to, 1802, it, was, determined, by, jacques, charles, unpublished, john, dalton, and, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, that, at, constant, pressure, ideal, gases, expanded, or, contracted, their, volume, linearly, charles, s, law, by, about, 1, 273, parts, per, degree, celsius, of, temperature, s, change, up, or, down, between, 0, c, and, 100, c, extrapolation, of, this, law, suggested, that, a, gas, cooled, to, about, 273, c, would, occupy, zero, volume, in, 1848, william, thomson, who, was, later, ennobled, as, lord, kelvin, published, a, paper, on, an, absolute, thermometric, scale, the, scale, proposed, in, the, paper, turned, out, to, be, unsatisfactory, but, the, principles, and, formulas, upon, which, the, scale, was, based, were, correct, for, example, in, a, footnote, thomson, derived, the, value, of, 273, c, for, absolute, zero, by, calculating, the, negative, reciprocal, of, 0, 00366, the, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, of, an, ideal, gas, per, degree, celsius, relative, to, the, ice, point, this, derived, value, agrees, with, the, currently, accepted, value, of, 273, 15, c, allowing, for, the, precision, and, uncertainty, involved, in, the, calculation, the, scale, was, designed, on, the, principle, that, a, unit, of, heat, descending, from, a, body, a, at, the, temperature, t, of, this, scale, to, a, body, b, at, the, temperature, t, 1, would, give, out, the, same, mechanical, effect, whatever, be, the, number, t, specifically, thomson, expressed, the, amount, of, work, necessary, to, produce, a, unit, of, heat, the, thermal, efficiency, as, t, 1, e, t, e, displaystyle, mu, t, 1, et, e, where, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, temperature, in, celsius, e, displaystyle, e, is, the, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, and, t, displaystyle, mu, t, was, carnot, s, function, a, substance, independent, quantity, depending, on, temperature, motivated, by, an, obsolete, version, of, carnot, s, theorem, the, scale, is, derived, by, finding, a, change, of, variables, t, 1848, f, t, displaystyle, t, 1848, f, t, of, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, such, that, d, t, 1848, d, t, displaystyle, dt, 1848, dt, is, proportional, to, displaystyle, mu, when, thomson, published, his, paper, in, 1848, he, only, considered, regnault, s, experimental, measurements, of, t, displaystyle, mu, t, that, same, year, james, prescott, joule, suggested, to, thomson, that, the, true, formula, for, carnot, s, function, was, t, j, e, 1, e, t, displaystyle, mu, t, j, frac, e, 1, et, where, j, displaystyle, j, is, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, a, unit, of, heat, now, referred, to, as, the, specific, heat, capacity, of, water, approximately, 771, 8, foot, pounds, force, per, degree, fahrenheit, per, pound, 4, 153, j, k, kg, thomson, was, initially, skeptical, of, the, deviations, of, joule, s, formula, from, experiment, stating, i, think, it, will, be, generally, admitted, that, there, can, be, no, such, inaccuracy, in, regnault, s, part, of, the, data, and, there, remains, only, the, uncertainty, regarding, the, density, of, saturated, steam, thomson, referred, to, the, correctness, of, joule, s, formula, as, mayer, s, hypothesis, on, account, of, it, having, been, first, assumed, by, mayer, thomson, arranged, numerous, experiments, in, coordination, with, joule, eventually, concluding, by, 1854, that, joule, s, formula, was, correct, and, the, effect, of, temperature, on, the, density, of, saturated, steam, accounted, for, all, discrepancies, with, regnault, s, data, therefore, in, terms, of, the, modern, kelvin, scale, t, displaystyle, t, the, first, scale, could, be, expressed, as, follows, t, 1848, 100, log, t, 273, k, log, 373, k, 273, k, displaystyle, t, 1848, 100, times, frac, log, t, text, 273, k, log, text, 373, k, text, 273, k, the, parameters, of, the, scale, were, arbitrarily, chosen, to, coincide, with, the, celsius, scale, at, 0, and, 100, c, or, 273, and, 373, k, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, water, on, this, scale, an, increase, of, approximately, 222, degrees, corresponds, to, a, doubling, of, kelvin, temperature, regardless, of, the, starting, temperature, and, infinite, cold, absolute, zero, has, a, numerical, value, of, negative, infinity, thomson, understood, that, with, joule, s, proposed, formula, for, displaystyle, mu, the, relationship, between, work, and, heat, for, a, perfect, thermodynamic, engine, was, simply, the, constant, j, displaystyle, j, in, 1854, thomson, and, joule, thus, formulated, a, second, absolute, scale, that, was, more, practical, and, convenient, agreeing, with, air, thermometers, for, most, purposes, specifically, the, numerical, measure, of, temperature, shall, be, simply, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, the, thermal, unit, divided, by, carnot, s, function, to, explain, this, definition, consider, a, reversible, carnot, cycle, engine, where, q, h, displaystyle, q, h, is, the, amount, of, heat, energy, transferred, into, the, system, q, c, displaystyle, q, c, is, the, heat, leaving, the, system, w, displaystyle, w, is, the, work, done, by, the, system, q, h, q, c, displaystyle, q, h, q, c, t, h, displaystyle, t, h, is, the, temperature, of, the, hot, reservoir, in, celsius, and, t, c, displaystyle, t, c, is, the, temperature, of, the, cold, reservoir, in, celsius, the, carnot, function, is, defined, as, w, q, h, t, h, t, c, displaystyle, mu, w, q, h, t, h, t, c, and, the, absolute, temperature, as, t, h, j, displaystyle, t, h, j, mu, one, finds, the, relationship, t, h, j, q, h, t, h, t, c, w, displaystyle, t, h, j, times, q, h, times, t, h, t, c, w, by, supposing, t, h, t, c, j, t, h, t, c, displaystyle, t, h, t, c, j, times, t, h, t, c, one, obtains, the, general, principle, of, an, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, for, the, carnot, engine, q, h, t, h, q, c, t, c, displaystyle, q, h, t, h, q, c, t, c, the, definition, can, be, shown, to, correspond, to, the, thermometric, temperature, of, the, ideal, gas, laws, this, definition, by, itself, is, not, sufficient, thomson, specified, that, the, scale, should, have, two, properties, these, two, properties, would, be, featured, in, all, future, versions, of, the, kelvin, scale, although, it, was, not, yet, known, by, that, name, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, kelvin, scale, was, often, called, the, absolute, celsius, scale, indicating, celsius, degrees, counted, from, absolute, zero, rather, than, the, freezing, point, of, water, and, using, the, same, symbol, for, regular, celsius, degrees, c, in, 1873, william, thomson, s, older, brother, james, coined, the, term, triple, point, to, describe, the, combination, of, temperature, and, pressure, at, which, the, solid, liquid, and, gas, phases, of, a, substance, were, capable, of, coexisting, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, while, any, two, phases, could, coexist, along, a, range, of, temperature, pressure, combinations, e, g, the, boiling, point, of, water, can, be, affected, quite, dramatically, by, raising, or, lowering, the, pressure, the, triple, point, condition, for, a, given, substance, can, occur, only, at, a, single, pressure, and, only, at, a, single, temperature, by, the, 1940s, the, triple, point, of, water, had, been, experimentally, measured, to, be, about, 0, 6, of, standard, atmospheric, pressure, and, very, close, to, 0, 01, c, per, the, historical, definition, of, celsius, then, in, use, in, 1948, the, celsius, scale, was, recalibrated, by, assigning, the, triple, point, temperature, of, water, the, value, of, 0, 01, c, exactly, and, allowing, the, melting, point, at, standard, atmospheric, pressure, to, have, an, empirically, determined, value, and, the, actual, melting, point, at, ambient, pressure, to, have, a, fluctuating, value, close, to, 0, c, this, was, justified, on, the, grounds, that, the, triple, point, was, judged, to, give, a, more, accurately, reproducible, reference, temperature, than, the, melting, point, the, triple, point, could, be, measured, with, 0, 0001, c, accuracy, while, the, melting, point, just, to, 0, 001, c, in, 1954, with, absolute, zero, having, been, experimentally, determined, to, be, about, 273, 15, c, per, the, definition, of, c, then, in, use, resolution, 3, of, the, 10th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, introduced, a, new, internationally, standardized, kelvin, scale, which, defined, the, triple, point, as, exactly, 273, 15, 0, 01, 273, 16, degrees, kelvin, in, 1967, 1968, resolution, 3, of, the, 13th, cgpm, renamed, the, unit, increment, of, thermodynamic, temperature, kelvin, symbol, k, replacing, degree, kelvin, symbol, k, the, 13th, cgpm, also, held, in, resolution, 4, that, the, kelvin, unit, of, thermodynamic, temperature, is, equal, to, the, fraction, 1, 273, 16, of, the, thermodynamic, temperature, of, the, triple, point, of, water, after, the, 1983, redefinition, of, the, metre, this, left, the, kelvin, the, second, and, the, kilogram, as, the, only, si, units, not, defined, with, reference, to, any, other, unit, in, 2005, noting, that, the, triple, point, could, be, influenced, by, the, isotopic, ratio, of, the, hydrogen, and, oxygen, making, up, a, water, sample, and, that, this, was, now, one, of, the, major, sources, of, the, observed, variability, between, different, realizations, of, the, water, triple, point, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, a, committee, of, the, cgpm, affirmed, that, for, the, purposes, of, delineating, the, temperature, of, the, triple, point, of, water, the, definition, of, the, kelvin, would, refer, to, water, having, the, isotopic, composition, specified, for, vienna, standard, mean, ocean, water, in, 2005, the, cipm, began, a, programme, to, redefine, the, kelvin, along, with, other, si, base, units, using, a, more, experimentally, rigorous, method, in, particular, the, committee, proposed, redefining, the, kelvin, such, that, the, boltzmann, constant, k, b, would, take, the, exact, value, 1, 380, 6505, 10, 23, j, k, the, committee, hoped, the, program, would, be, completed, in, time, for, its, adoption, by, the, cgpm, at, its, 2011, meeting, but, at, the, 2011, meeting, the, decision, was, postponed, to, the, 2014, meeting, when, it, would, be, considered, part, of, a, larger, program, a, challenge, was, to, avoid, degrading, the, accuracy, of, measurements, close, to, the, triple, point, the, redefinition, was, further, postponed, in, 2014, pending, more, accurate, measurements, of, the, boltzmann, constant, in, terms, of, the, current, definition, but, was, finally, adopted, at, the, 26th, cgpm, in, late, 2018, with, a, value, of, k, b, 1, 380, 649, 10, 23, j, k, 1, for, scientific, purposes, the, redefinition, s, main, advantage, is, in, allowing, more, accurate, measurements, at, very, low, and, very, high, temperatures, as, the, techniques, used, depend, on, the, boltzmann, constant, independence, from, any, particular, substance, or, measurement, is, also, a, philosophical, advantage, the, kelvin, now, only, depends, on, the, boltzmann, constant, and, universal, constants, see, 2019, si, unit, dependencies, diagram, allowing, the, kelvin, to, be, expressed, exactly, as, for, practical, purposes, the, redefinition, was, unnoticed, enough, digits, were, used, for, the, boltzmann, constant, to, ensure, that, 273, 16, k, has, enough, significant, digits, to, contain, the, uncertainty, of, water, s, triple, point, and, water, still, normally, freezes, at, 0, c, to, a, high, degree, of, precision, but, before, the, redefinition, the, triple, point, of, water, was, exact, and, the, boltzmann, constant, had, a, measured, value, of, 1, 380, 649, 03, 51, 10, 23, j, k, with, a, relative, standard, uncertainty, of, 3, 7, 10, 7, afterward, the, boltzmann, constant, is, exact, and, the, uncertainty, is, transferred, to, the, triple, point, of, water, which, is, now, 273, 1600, 1, k, the, new, definition, officially, came, into, force, on, 20, may, 2019, the, 144th, anniversary, of, the, metre, convention, the, kelvin, is, often, used, as, a, measure, of, the, colour, temperature, of, light, sources, colour, temperature, is, based, upon, the, principle, that, a, black, body, radiator, emits, light, with, a, frequency, distribution, characteristic, of, its, temperature, black, bodies, at, temperatures, below, about, 4000, k, appear, reddish, whereas, those, above, about, 7500, k, appear, bluish, colour, temperature, is, important, in, the, fields, of, image, projection, and, photography, where, a, colour, temperature, of, approximately, 5600, k, is, required, to, match, daylight, film, emulsions, in, astronomy, the, stellar, classification, of, stars, and, their, place, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, are, based, in, part, upon, their, surface, temperature, known, as, effective, temperature, the, photosphere, of, the, sun, for, instance, has, an, effective, temperature, of, 5772, k, as, adopted, by, iau, 2015, resolution, b3, digital, cameras, and, photographic, software, often, use, colour, temperature, in, k, in, edit, and, setup, menus, the, simple, guide, is, that, higher, colour, temperature, produces, an, image, with, enhanced, white, and, blue, hues, the, reduction, in, colour, temperature, produces, an, image, more, dominated, by, reddish, warmer, colours, for, electronics, the, kelvin, is, used, as, an, indicator, of, how, noisy, a, circuit, is, in, relation, to, an, ultimate, noise, floor, i, e, the, noise, temperature, the, johnson, nyquist, noise, of, resistors, which, produces, an, associated, ktc, noise, when, combined, with, capacitors, is, a, type, of, thermal, noise, derived, from, the, boltzmann, constant, and, can, be, used, to, determine, the, noise, temperature, of, a, circuit, using, the, friis, formulas, for, noise, the, only, si, derived, unit, with, a, special, name, derived, from, the, kelvin, is, the, degree, celsius, like, other, si, units, the, kelvin, can, also, be, modified, by, adding, a, metric, prefix, that, multiplies, it, by, a, power, of, 10, according, to, si, convention, the, kelvin, is, never, referred, to, nor, written, as, a, degree, the, word, kelvin, is, not, capitalized, when, used, as, a, unit, it, may, be, in, plural, form, as, appropriate, for, example, it, is, 283, kelvins, outside, as, for, it, is, 50, degrees, fahrenheit, and, 10, degrees, celsius, the, unit, s, symbol, k, is, a, capital, letter, per, the, si, convention, to, capitalize, symbols, of, units, derived, from, the, name, of, a, person, it, is, common, convention, to, capitalize, kelvin, when, referring, to, lord, kelvin, or, the, kelvin, scale, the, unit, symbol, k, is, encoded, in, unicode, at, code, point, u, 212a, kelvin, sign, however, this, is, a, compatibility, character, provided, for, compatibility, with, legacy, encodings, the, unicode, standard, recommends, using, u, 004b, k, latin, capital, letter, k, instead, that, is, a, normal, capital, k, three, letterlike, symbols, have, been, given, canonical, equivalence, to, regular, letters, u, 2126, ohm, sign, u, 212a, kelvin, sign, and, u, 212b, angstrom, sign, in, all, three, instances, the, regular, letter, should, be, used
