manganese, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, mn, and, atomic, number, 25, it, is, a, hard, brittle, silvery, metal, often, found, in, minerals, in, combination, with, iron, manganese, was, first, isolated, in, the, 1770s, it, is, a, transition, metal, with, a, multifaceted, array, of, industrial, alloy, uses, particularly, in, stainless, steels, it, improves, strength, workability, and, resistance, to, wear, manganese, oxide, is, used, as, an, oxidising, agent, as, a, rubber, additive, and, in, glass, making, fertilisers, and, ceramics, manganese, sulfate, can, be, used, as, a, fungicide, manganese, is, also, an, essential, human, dietary, element, important, in, macronutrient, metabolism, bone, formation, and, free, radical, defense, systems, it, is, a, critical, component, in, dozens, of, proteins, and, enzymes, it, is, found, mostly, in, the, bones, but, also, the, liver, kidneys, and, brain, in, the, human, brain, the, manganese, is, bound, to, manganese, metalloproteins, most, notably, glutamine, synthetase, in, astrocytes, it, is, familiar, in, the, laboratory, in, the, form, of, the, deep, violet, salt, potassium, permanganate, it, occurs, at, the, active, sites, in, some, enzymes, of, particular, interest, is, the, use, of, a, mn, o, cluster, the, oxygen, evolving, complex, in, the, production, of, oxygen, by, plants, manganese, is, a, silvery, gray, metal, that, resembles, iron, it, is, hard, and, very, brittle, difficult, to, fuse, but, easy, to, oxidize, manganese, and, its, common, ions, are, paramagnetic, manganese, tarnishes, slowly, in, air, and, oxidizes, rusts, like, iron, in, water, containing, dissolved, oxygen, naturally, occurring, manganese, is, composed, of, one, stable, isotope, 55, mn, several, radioisotopes, have, been, isolated, and, described, ranging, in, atomic, weight, from, 46, u, 46, mn, to, 72, u, 72, mn, the, most, stable, are, 53, mn, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 7, million, years, 54, mn, with, a, half, life, of, 312, 2, days, and, 52, mn, with, a, half, life, of, 5, 591, days, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, three, hours, and, the, majority, of, less, than, one, minute, the, primary, decay, mode, in, isotopes, lighter, than, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 55, mn, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, in, heavier, isotopes, is, beta, decay, manganese, also, has, three, meta, states, manganese, is, part, of, the, iron, group, of, elements, which, are, thought, to, be, synthesized, in, large, stars, shortly, before, the, supernova, explosion, 53, mn, decays, to, 53, cr, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 7, million, years, because, of, its, relatively, short, half, life, 53, mn, is, relatively, rare, produced, by, cosmic, rays, impact, on, iron, manganese, isotopic, contents, are, typically, combined, with, chromium, isotopic, contents, and, have, found, application, in, isotope, geology, and, radiometric, dating, mn, cr, isotopic, ratios, reinforce, the, evidence, from, 26, al, and, 107, pd, for, the, early, history, of, the, solar, system, variations, in, 53, cr, 52, cr, and, mn, cr, ratios, from, several, meteorites, suggest, an, initial, 53, mn, 55, mn, ratio, which, indicate, that, mn, cr, isotopic, composition, must, result, from, in, situ, decay, of, 53, mn, in, differentiated, planetary, bodies, hence, 53, mn, provides, additional, evidence, for, nucleosynthetic, processes, immediately, before, coalescence, of, the, solar, system, four, allotropes, structural, forms, of, solid, manganese, are, known, labeled, and, and, occurring, at, successively, higher, temperatures, all, are, metallic, stable, at, standard, pressure, and, have, a, cubic, crystal, lattice, but, they, vary, widely, in, their, atomic, structures, alpha, manganese, mn, is, the, equilibrium, phase, at, room, temperature, it, has, a, body, centered, cubic, lattice, and, is, unusual, among, elemental, metals, in, having, a, very, complex, unit, cell, with, 58, atoms, per, cell, 29, atoms, per, primitive, unit, cell, in, four, different, types, of, site, it, is, paramagnetic, at, room, temperature, and, antiferromagnetic, at, temperatures, below, 95, k, 178, c, beta, manganese, mn, forms, when, heated, above, the, transition, temperature, of, 973, k, 700, c, 1, 290, f, it, has, a, primitive, cubic, structure, with, 20, atoms, per, unit, cell, at, two, types, of, sites, which, is, as, complex, as, that, of, any, other, elemental, metal, it, is, easily, obtained, as, a, metastable, phase, at, room, temperature, by, rapid, quenching, it, does, not, show, magnetic, ordering, remaining, paramagnetic, down, to, the, lowest, temperature, measured, 1, 1, k, gamma, manganese, mn, forms, when, heated, above, 1, 370, k, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, it, has, a, simple, face, centered, cubic, structure, four, atoms, per, unit, cell, when, quenched, to, room, temperature, it, converts, to, mn, but, it, can, be, stabilized, at, room, temperature, by, alloying, it, with, at, least, 5, percent, of, other, elements, such, as, c, fe, ni, cu, pd, or, au, and, these, solute, stabilized, alloys, distort, into, a, face, centered, tetragonal, structure, delta, manganese, mn, forms, when, heated, above, 1, 406, k, 1, 130, c, 2, 070, f, and, is, stable, up, to, the, manganese, melting, point, of, 1, 519, k, 1, 250, c, 2, 270, f, it, has, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, two, atoms, per, cubic, unit, cell, common, oxidation, states, of, manganese, are, 2, 3, 4, 6, and, 7, although, all, oxidation, states, from, 3, to, 7, except, 2, have, been, observed, manganese, in, oxidation, state, 7, is, represented, by, salts, of, the, intensely, purple, permanganate, anion, mno, 4, potassium, permanganate, is, a, commonly, used, laboratory, reagent, because, of, its, oxidizing, properties, it, is, used, as, a, topical, medicine, for, example, in, the, treatment, of, fish, diseases, solutions, of, potassium, permanganate, were, among, the, first, stains, and, fixatives, to, be, used, in, the, preparation, of, biological, cells, and, tissues, for, electron, microscopy, aside, from, various, permanganate, salts, mn, vii, is, represented, by, the, unstable, volatile, derivative, mn, 2, o, 7, oxyhalides, mno, 3, f, and, mno, 3, cl, are, powerful, oxidizing, agents, the, most, prominent, example, of, mn, in, the, 6, oxidation, state, is, the, green, anion, manganate, 2, manganate, salts, are, intermediates, in, the, extraction, of, manganese, from, its, ores, compounds, with, oxidation, states, 5, are, somewhat, elusive, and, often, found, associated, to, an, oxide, o, 2, or, nitride, n, 3, ligand, one, example, is, the, blue, anion, hypomanganate, 3, mn, iv, is, somewhat, enigmatic, because, it, is, common, in, nature, but, far, rarer, in, synthetic, chemistry, the, most, common, mn, ore, pyrolusite, is, mno, 2, it, is, the, dark, brown, pigment, of, many, cave, drawings, but, is, also, a, common, ingredient, in, dry, cell, batteries, complexes, of, mn, iv, are, well, known, but, they, require, elaborate, ligands, mn, iv, oh, complexes, are, an, intermediate, in, some, enzymes, including, the, oxygen, evolving, center, oec, in, plants, simple, derivatives, mn, 3, are, rarely, encountered, but, can, be, stabilized, by, suitably, basic, ligands, manganese, iii, acetate, is, an, oxidant, useful, in, organic, synthesis, solid, compounds, of, manganese, iii, are, characterized, by, its, strong, purple, red, color, and, a, preference, for, distorted, octahedral, coordination, resulting, from, the, jahn, teller, effect, a, particularly, common, oxidation, state, for, manganese, in, aqueous, solution, is, 2, which, has, a, pale, pink, color, many, manganese, ii, compounds, are, known, such, as, the, aquo, complexes, derived, from, manganese, ii, sulfate, mnso, 4, and, manganese, ii, chloride, mncl, 2, this, oxidation, state, is, also, seen, in, the, mineral, rhodochrosite, manganese, ii, carbonate, manganese, ii, commonly, exists, with, a, high, spin, s, 5, 2, ground, state, because, of, the, high, pairing, energy, for, manganese, ii, there, are, no, spin, allowed, d, d, transitions, in, manganese, ii, which, explain, its, faint, color, manganese, forms, a, large, variety, of, organometallic, derivatives, i, e, compounds, with, mn, c, bonds, the, organometallic, derivatives, include, numerous, examples, of, mn, in, its, lower, oxidation, states, i, e, mn, iii, up, through, mn, i, this, area, of, organometallic, chemistry, is, attractive, because, mn, is, inexpensive, and, of, relatively, low, toxicity, of, greatest, commercial, interest, is, mmt, methylcyclopentadienyl, manganese, tricarbonyl, which, is, used, as, an, anti, knock, compound, added, to, gasoline, petrol, in, some, countries, it, features, mn, i, consistent, with, other, aspects, of, mn, ii, chemistry, manganocene, mn, c, 5, h, 5, 2, is, high, spin, in, contrast, its, neighboring, metal, iron, forms, an, air, stable, low, spin, derivative, in, the, form, of, ferrocene, fe, c, 5, h, 5, 2, when, conducted, under, an, atmosphere, of, carbon, monoxide, reduction, of, mn, ii, salts, gives, dimanganese, decacarbonyl, mn, 2, co, 10, an, orange, and, volatile, solid, the, air, stability, of, this, mn, 0, compound, and, its, many, derivatives, reflects, the, powerful, electron, acceptor, properties, of, carbon, monoxide, many, alkene, complexes, and, alkyne, complexes, are, derived, from, mn, 2, co, 10, in, mn, ch, 3, 2, dmpe, 2, mn, ii, is, low, spin, which, contrasts, with, the, high, spin, character, of, its, precursor, mnbr, 2, dmpe, 2, dmpe, ch, 3, 2, pch, 2, ch, 2, p, ch, 3, 2, polyalkyl, and, polyaryl, derivatives, of, manganese, often, exist, in, higher, oxidation, states, reflecting, the, electron, releasing, properties, of, alkyl, and, aryl, ligands, one, example, is, 2, the, origin, of, the, name, manganese, is, complex, in, ancient, times, two, black, minerals, were, identified, from, the, regions, of, the, magnetes, either, magnesia, located, within, modern, greece, or, magnesia, ad, sipylum, located, within, modern, turkey, they, were, both, called, magnes, from, their, place, of, origin, but, were, considered, to, differ, in, sex, the, male, magnes, attracted, iron, and, was, the, iron, ore, now, known, as, lodestone, or, magnetite, and, which, probably, gave, us, the, term, magnet, the, female, magnes, ore, did, not, attract, iron, but, was, used, to, decolorize, glass, this, female, magnes, was, later, called, magnesia, known, now, in, modern, times, as, pyrolusite, or, manganese, dioxide, neither, this, mineral, nor, elemental, manganese, is, magnetic, in, the, 16th, century, manganese, dioxide, was, called, manganesum, note, the, two, ns, instead, of, one, by, glassmakers, possibly, as, a, corruption, and, concatenation, of, two, words, since, alchemists, and, glassmakers, eventually, had, to, differentiate, a, magnesia, nigra, the, black, ore, from, magnesia, alba, a, white, ore, also, from, magnesia, also, useful, in, glassmaking, michele, mercati, called, magnesia, nigra, manganesa, and, finally, the, metal, isolated, from, it, became, known, as, manganese, german, mangan, the, name, magnesia, eventually, was, then, used, to, refer, only, to, the, white, magnesia, alba, magnesium, oxide, which, provided, the, name, magnesium, for, the, free, element, when, it, was, isolated, much, later, manganese, dioxide, which, is, abundant, in, nature, has, long, been, used, as, a, pigment, the, cave, paintings, in, gargas, that, are, 30, 000, to, 24, 000, years, old, are, made, from, the, mineral, form, of, mno, 2, pigments, manganese, compounds, were, used, by, egyptian, and, roman, glassmakers, either, to, add, to, or, remove, color, from, glass, use, as, glassmakers, soap, continued, through, the, middle, ages, until, modern, times, and, is, evident, in, 14th, century, glass, from, venice, because, it, was, used, in, glassmaking, manganese, dioxide, was, available, for, experiments, by, alchemists, the, first, chemists, ignatius, gottfried, kaim, 1770, and, johann, glauber, 17th, century, discovered, that, manganese, dioxide, could, be, converted, to, permanganate, a, useful, laboratory, reagent, kaim, also, may, have, reduced, manganese, dioxide, to, isolate, the, metal, but, that, is, uncertain, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, used, manganese, dioxide, to, produce, chlorine, first, hydrochloric, acid, or, a, mixture, of, dilute, sulfuric, acid, and, sodium, chloride, was, made, to, react, with, manganese, dioxide, and, later, hydrochloric, acid, from, the, leblanc, process, was, used, and, the, manganese, dioxide, was, recycled, by, the, weldon, process, the, production, of, chlorine, and, hypochlorite, bleaching, agents, was, a, large, consumer, of, manganese, ores, scheele, and, others, were, aware, that, pyrolusite, mineral, form, of, manganese, dioxide, contained, a, new, element, johan, gottlieb, gahn, isolated, an, impure, sample, of, manganese, metal, in, 1774, which, he, did, by, reducing, the, dioxide, with, carbon, the, manganese, content, of, some, iron, ores, used, in, greece, led, to, speculations, that, steel, produced, from, that, ore, contains, additional, manganese, making, the, spartan, steel, exceptionally, hard, around, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, manganese, was, used, in, steelmaking, and, several, patents, were, granted, in, 1816, it, was, documented, that, iron, alloyed, with, manganese, was, harder, but, not, more, brittle, in, 1837, british, academic, james, couper, noted, an, association, between, miners, heavy, exposure, to, manganese, and, a, form, of, parkinson, s, disease, in, 1912, united, states, patents, were, granted, for, protecting, firearms, against, rust, and, corrosion, with, manganese, phosphate, electrochemical, conversion, coatings, and, the, process, has, seen, widespread, use, ever, since, the, invention, of, the, leclanch, cell, in, 1866, and, the, subsequent, improvement, of, batteries, containing, manganese, dioxide, as, cathodic, depolarizer, increased, the, demand, for, manganese, dioxide, until, the, development, of, batteries, with, nickel, cadmium, and, lithium, most, batteries, contained, manganese, the, zinc, carbon, battery, and, the, alkaline, battery, normally, use, industrially, produced, manganese, dioxide, because, naturally, occurring, manganese, dioxide, contains, impurities, in, the, 20th, century, manganese, dioxide, was, widely, used, as, the, cathodic, for, commercial, disposable, dry, batteries, of, both, the, standard, zinc, carbon, and, alkaline, types, manganese, is, essential, to, iron, and, steel, production, by, virtue, of, its, sulfur, fixing, deoxidizing, and, alloying, properties, this, application, was, first, recognized, by, the, british, metallurgist, robert, forester, mushet, 1811, 1891, who, in, 1856, introduced, the, element, in, the, form, of, spiegeleisen, manganese, comprises, about, 1000, ppm, 0, 1, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, is, the, 12th, most, abundant, element, soil, contains, 7, 9000, ppm, of, manganese, with, an, average, of, 440, ppm, the, atmosphere, contains, 0, 01, g, m, 3, manganese, occurs, principally, as, pyrolusite, mno, 2, braunite, mn, 2, mn, 3, 6, sio, 12, psilomelane, ba, h, 2, o, 2, mn, 5, o, 10, and, to, a, lesser, extent, as, rhodochrosite, mnco, 3, the, most, important, manganese, ore, is, pyrolusite, mno, 2, other, economically, important, manganese, ores, usually, show, a, close, spatial, relation, to, the, iron, ores, such, as, sphalerite, land, based, resources, are, large, but, irregularly, distributed, about, 80, of, the, known, world, manganese, resources, are, in, south, africa, other, important, manganese, deposits, are, in, ukraine, australia, india, china, gabon, and, brazil, according, to, 1978, estimate, the, ocean, floor, has, 500, billion, tons, of, manganese, nodules, attempts, to, find, economically, viable, methods, of, harvesting, manganese, nodules, were, abandoned, in, the, 1970s, in, south, africa, most, identified, deposits, are, located, near, hotazel, in, the, northern, cape, province, kalahari, manganese, fields, with, a, 2011, estimate, of, 15, billion, tons, in, 2011, south, africa, produced, 3, 4, million, tons, topping, all, other, nations, manganese, is, mainly, mined, in, south, africa, australia, china, gabon, brazil, india, kazakhstan, ghana, ukraine, and, malaysia, for, the, production, of, ferromanganese, the, manganese, ore, is, mixed, with, iron, ore, and, carbon, and, then, reduced, either, in, a, blast, furnace, or, in, an, electric, arc, furnace, the, resulting, ferromanganese, has, a, manganese, content, of, 30, 80, pure, manganese, used, for, the, production, of, iron, free, alloys, is, produced, by, leaching, manganese, ore, with, sulfuric, acid, and, a, subsequent, electrowinning, process, a, more, progressive, extraction, process, involves, directly, reducing, a, low, grade, manganese, ore, by, heap, leaching, this, is, done, by, percolating, natural, gas, through, the, bottom, of, the, heap, the, natural, gas, provides, the, heat, needs, to, be, at, least, 850, c, and, the, reducing, agent, carbon, monoxide, this, reduces, all, of, the, manganese, ore, to, manganese, oxide, mno, which, is, a, leachable, form, the, ore, then, travels, through, a, grinding, circuit, to, reduce, the, particle, size, of, the, ore, to, between, 150, and, 250, m, increasing, the, surface, area, to, aid, leaching, the, ore, is, then, added, to, a, leach, tank, of, sulfuric, acid, and, ferrous, iron, fe, 2, in, a, 1, 6, 1, ratio, the, iron, reacts, with, the, manganese, dioxide, mno, 2, to, form, iron, hydroxide, feo, oh, and, elemental, manganese, mn, this, process, yields, approximately, 92, recovery, of, the, manganese, for, further, purification, the, manganese, can, then, be, sent, to, an, electrowinning, facility, in, 1972, the, cia, s, project, azorian, through, billionaire, howard, hughes, commissioned, the, ship, hughes, glomar, explorer, with, the, cover, story, of, harvesting, manganese, nodules, from, the, sea, floor, that, triggered, a, rush, of, activity, to, collect, manganese, nodules, which, was, not, actually, practical, the, real, mission, of, hughes, glomar, explorer, was, to, raise, a, sunken, soviet, submarine, the, k, 129, with, the, goal, of, retrieving, soviet, code, books, an, abundant, resource, of, manganese, in, the, form, of, manganese, nodules, found, on, the, ocean, floor, these, nodules, which, are, composed, of, 29, manganese, are, located, along, the, ocean, floor, the, environmental, impacts, of, nodule, collection, are, of, interest, dissolved, manganese, dmn, is, found, throughout, the, world, s, oceans, 90, of, which, originates, from, hydrothermal, vents, particulate, mn, develops, in, buoyant, plumes, over, an, active, vent, source, while, the, dmn, behaves, conservatively, mn, concentrations, vary, between, the, water, columns, of, the, ocean, at, the, surface, dmn, is, elevated, due, to, input, from, external, sources, such, as, rivers, dust, and, shelf, sediments, coastal, sediments, normally, have, lower, mn, concentrations, but, can, increase, due, to, anthropogenic, discharges, from, industries, such, as, mining, and, steel, manufacturing, which, enter, the, ocean, from, river, inputs, surface, dmn, concentrations, can, also, be, elevated, biologically, through, photosynthesis, and, physically, from, coastal, upwelling, and, wind, driven, surface, currents, internal, cycling, such, as, photo, reduction, from, uv, radiation, can, also, elevate, levels, by, speeding, up, the, dissolution, of, mn, oxides, and, oxidative, scavenging, preventing, mn, from, sinking, to, deeper, waters, elevated, levels, at, mid, depths, can, occur, near, mid, ocean, ridges, and, hydrothermal, vents, the, hydrothermal, vents, release, dmn, enriched, fluid, into, the, water, the, dmn, can, then, travel, up, to, 4, 000, km, due, to, the, microbial, capsules, present, preventing, exchange, with, particles, lowing, the, sinking, rates, dissolved, mn, concentrations, are, even, higher, when, oxygen, levels, are, low, overall, dmn, concentrations, are, normally, higher, in, coastal, regions, and, decrease, when, moving, offshore, manganese, occurs, in, soils, in, three, oxidation, states, the, divalent, cation, mn, 2, and, as, brownish, black, oxides, and, hydroxides, containing, mn, iii, iv, such, as, mnooh, and, mno, 2, soil, ph, and, oxidation, reduction, conditions, affect, which, of, these, three, forms, of, mn, is, dominant, in, a, given, soil, at, ph, values, less, than, 6, or, under, anaerobic, conditions, mn, ii, dominates, while, under, more, alkaline, and, aerobic, conditions, mn, iii, iv, oxides, and, hydroxides, predominate, these, effects, of, soil, acidity, and, aeration, state, on, the, form, of, mn, can, be, modified, or, controlled, by, microbial, activity, microbial, respiration, can, cause, both, the, oxidation, of, mn, 2, to, the, oxides, and, it, can, cause, reduction, of, the, oxides, to, the, divalent, cation, the, mn, iii, iv, oxides, exist, as, brownish, black, stains, and, small, nodules, on, sand, silt, and, clay, particles, these, surface, coatings, on, other, soil, particles, have, high, surface, area, and, carry, negative, charge, the, charged, sites, can, adsorb, and, retain, various, cations, especially, heavy, metals, e, g, cr, 3, cu, 2, zn, 2, and, pb, 2, in, addition, the, oxides, can, adsorb, organic, acids, and, other, compounds, the, adsorption, of, the, metals, and, organic, compounds, can, then, cause, them, to, be, oxidized, while, the, mn, iii, iv, oxides, are, reduced, to, mn, 2, e, g, cr, 3, to, cr, vi, and, colorless, hydroquinone, to, tea, colored, quinone, polymers, manganese, is, essential, to, iron, and, steel, production, by, virtue, of, its, sulfur, fixing, deoxidizing, and, alloying, properties, manganese, has, no, satisfactory, substitute, in, these, applications, in, metallurgy, steelmaking, including, its, ironmaking, component, has, accounted, for, most, manganese, demand, presently, in, the, range, of, 85, to, 90, of, the, total, demand, manganese, is, a, key, component, of, low, cost, stainless, steel, often, ferromanganese, usually, about, 80, manganese, is, the, intermediate, in, modern, processes, small, amounts, of, manganese, improve, the, workability, of, steel, at, high, temperatures, by, forming, a, high, melting, sulfide, and, preventing, the, formation, of, a, liquid, iron, sulfide, at, the, grain, boundaries, if, the, manganese, content, reaches, 4, the, embrittlement, of, the, steel, becomes, a, dominant, feature, the, embrittlement, decreases, at, higher, manganese, concentrations, and, reaches, an, acceptable, level, at, 8, steel, containing, 8, to, 15, of, manganese, has, a, high, tensile, strength, of, up, to, 863, mpa, steel, with, 12, manganese, was, discovered, in, 1882, by, robert, hadfield, and, is, still, known, as, hadfield, steel, mangalloy, it, was, used, for, british, military, steel, helmets, and, later, by, the, u, s, military, manganese, is, used, in, production, of, alloys, with, aluminium, aluminium, with, roughly, 1, 5, manganese, has, increased, resistance, to, corrosion, through, grains, that, absorb, impurities, which, would, lead, to, galvanic, corrosion, the, corrosion, resistant, aluminium, alloys, 3004, and, 3104, 0, 8, to, 1, 5, manganese, are, used, for, most, beverage, cans, before, 2000, more, than, 1, 6, million, tonnes, of, those, alloys, were, used, at, 1, manganese, this, consumed, 16, 000, tonnes, of, manganese, manganese, iv, oxide, was, used, in, the, original, type, of, dry, cell, battery, as, an, electron, acceptor, from, zinc, and, is, the, blackish, material, in, carbon, zinc, type, flashlight, cells, the, manganese, dioxide, is, reduced, to, the, manganese, oxide, hydroxide, mno, oh, during, discharging, preventing, the, formation, of, hydrogen, at, the, anode, of, the, battery, the, same, material, also, functions, in, newer, alkaline, batteries, usually, battery, cells, which, use, the, same, basic, reaction, but, a, different, electrolyte, mixture, in, 2002, more, than, 230, 000, tons, of, manganese, dioxide, was, used, for, this, purpose, copper, alloys, of, manganese, such, as, manganin, are, commonly, found, in, metal, element, shunt, resistors, used, for, measuring, relatively, large, amounts, of, current, these, alloys, have, very, low, temperature, coefficient, of, resistance, and, are, resistant, to, sulfur, this, makes, the, alloys, particularly, useful, in, harsh, automotive, and, industrial, environments, manganese, oxide, and, sulfate, are, components, of, fertilizers, in, the, year, 2000, an, estimated, 20, 000, tons, of, these, compounds, were, used, in, fertilizers, in, the, us, alone, a, comparable, amount, of, mn, compounds, was, also, used, in, animal, feeds, methylcyclopentadienyl, manganese, tricarbonyl, is, an, additive, in, some, unleaded, gasoline, to, boost, octane, rating, and, reduce, engine, knocking, manganese, iv, oxide, manganese, dioxide, mno, 2, is, used, as, a, reagent, in, organic, chemistry, for, the, oxidation, of, benzylic, alcohols, where, the, hydroxyl, group, is, adjacent, to, an, aromatic, ring, manganese, dioxide, has, been, used, since, antiquity, to, oxidize, and, neutralize, the, greenish, tinge, in, glass, from, trace, amounts, of, iron, contamination, mno, 2, is, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, oxygen, and, chlorine, and, in, drying, black, paints, in, some, preparations, it, is, a, brown, pigment, for, paint, and, is, a, constituent, of, natural, umber, tetravalent, manganese, is, used, as, an, activator, in, red, emitting, phosphors, while, many, compounds, are, known, which, show, luminescence, the, majority, are, not, used, in, commercial, application, due, to, low, efficiency, or, deep, red, emission, however, several, mn, 4, activated, fluorides, were, reported, as, potential, red, emitting, phosphors, for, warm, white, leds, but, to, this, day, only, k, 2, sif, 6, mn, 4, is, commercially, available, for, use, in, warm, white, leds, the, metal, is, occasionally, used, in, coins, until, 2000, the, only, united, states, coin, to, use, manganese, was, the, wartime, nickel, from, 1942, to, 1945, an, alloy, of, 75, copper, and, 25, nickel, was, traditionally, used, for, the, production, of, nickel, coins, however, because, of, shortage, of, nickel, metal, during, the, war, it, was, substituted, by, more, available, silver, and, manganese, thus, resulting, in, an, alloy, of, 56, copper, 35, silver, and, 9, manganese, since, 2000, dollar, coins, for, example, the, sacagawea, dollar, and, the, presidential, 1, coins, are, made, from, a, brass, containing, 7, of, manganese, with, a, pure, copper, core, in, both, cases, of, nickel, and, dollar, the, use, of, manganese, in, the, coin, was, to, duplicate, the, electromagnetic, properties, of, a, previous, identically, sized, and, valued, coin, in, the, mechanisms, of, vending, machines, in, the, case, of, the, later, u, s, dollar, coins, the, manganese, alloy, was, intended, to, duplicate, the, properties, of, the, copper, nickel, alloy, used, in, the, previous, susan, b, anthony, dollar, manganese, compounds, have, been, used, as, pigments, and, for, the, coloring, of, ceramics, and, glass, the, brown, color, of, ceramic, is, sometimes, the, result, of, manganese, compounds, in, the, glass, industry, manganese, compounds, are, used, for, two, effects, manganese, iii, reacts, with, iron, ii, to, reduce, strong, green, color, in, glass, by, forming, less, colored, iron, iii, and, slightly, pink, manganese, ii, compensating, for, the, residual, color, of, the, iron, iii, larger, quantities, of, manganese, are, used, to, produce, pink, colored, glass, in, 2009, mas, subramanian, and, associates, at, oregon, state, university, discovered, that, manganese, can, be, combined, with, yttrium, and, indium, to, form, an, intensely, blue, non, toxic, inert, fade, resistant, pigment, yinmn, blue, the, first, new, blue, pigment, discovered, in, 200, years, many, classes, of, enzymes, contain, manganese, cofactors, including, oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and, ligases, other, enzymes, containing, manganese, are, arginase, and, a, mn, containing, superoxide, dismutase, mn, sod, some, reverse, transcriptases, of, many, retroviruses, although, not, lentiviruses, such, as, hiv, contain, manganese, manganese, containing, polypeptides, are, the, diphtheria, toxin, lectins, and, integrins, the, oxygen, evolving, complex, oec, containing, four, atoms, of, manganese, is, a, part, of, photosystem, ii, contained, in, the, thylakoid, membranes, of, chloroplasts, the, oec, is, responsible, for, the, terminal, photooxidation, of, water, during, the, light, reactions, of, photosynthesis, i, e, it, is, the, catalyst, that, makes, the, o, 2, produced, by, plants, manganese, is, an, essential, human, dietary, element, and, is, present, as, a, coenzyme, in, several, biological, processes, which, include, macronutrient, metabolism, bone, formation, and, free, radical, defense, systems, manganese, is, a, critical, component, in, dozens, of, proteins, and, enzymes, the, human, body, contains, about, 12, mg, of, manganese, mostly, in, the, bones, the, soft, tissue, remainder, is, concentrated, in, the, liver, and, kidneys, in, the, human, brain, the, manganese, is, bound, to, manganese, metalloproteins, most, notably, glutamine, synthetase, in, astrocytes, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, iom, updated, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, for, minerals, in, 2001, for, manganese, there, was, not, sufficient, information, to, set, ears, and, rdas, so, needs, are, described, as, estimates, for, adequate, intakes, ais, as, for, safety, the, iom, sets, tolerable, upper, intake, levels, uls, for, vitamins, and, minerals, when, evidence, is, sufficient, in, the, case, of, manganese, the, adult, ul, is, set, at, 11, mg, day, collectively, the, ears, rdas, ais, and, uls, are, referred, to, as, dietary, reference, intakes, dris, manganese, deficiency, is, rare, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, refers, to, the, collective, set, of, information, as, dietary, reference, values, with, population, reference, intake, pri, instead, of, rda, and, average, requirement, instead, of, ear, ai, and, ul, are, defined, the, same, as, in, the, united, states, for, people, ages, 15, and, older, the, ai, is, set, at, 3, 0, mg, day, ais, for, pregnancy, and, lactation, is, 3, 0, mg, day, for, children, ages, 1, 14, years, the, ais, increase, with,

to, set, a, ul, for, u, s, food, and, dietary, supplement, labeling, purposes, the, amount, in, a, serving, is, expressed, as, a, percent, of, daily, value, dv, for, manganese, labeling, purposes, 100, of, the, daily, value, was, 2, 0, mg, but, as, of, 27, may, 2016, it, was, revised, to, 2, 3, mg, to, bring, it, into, agreement, with, the, rda, a, table, of, the, old, and, new, adult, daily, values, is, provided, at, reference, daily, intake, excessive, exposure, or, intake, may, lead, to, a, condition, known, as, manganism, a, neurodegenerative, disorder, that, causes, dopaminergic, neuronal, death, and, symptoms, similar, to, parkinson, s, disease, manganese, deficiency, in, humans, which, is, rare, results, in, a, number, of, medical, problems, a, deficiency, of, manganese, causes, skeletal, deformation, in, animals, and, inhibits, the, production, of, collagen, in, wound, healing, waterborne, manganese, has, a, greater, bioavailability, than, dietary, manganese, according, to, results, from, a, 2010, study, higher, levels, of, exposure, to, manganese, in, drinking, water, are, associated, with, increased, intellectual, impairment, and, reduced, intelligence, quotients, in, school, age, children, it, is, hypothesized, that, long, term, exposure, due, to, inhaling, the, naturally, occurring, manganese, in, shower, water, puts, up, to, 8, 7, million, americans, at, risk, however, data, indicates, that, the, human, body, can, recover, from, certain, adverse, effects, of, overexposure, to, manganese, if, the, exposure, is, stopped, and, the, body, can, clear, the, excess, mn, levels, can, increase, in, seawater, when, hypoxic, periods, occur, since, 1990, there, have, been, reports, of, mn, accumulation, in, marine, organisms, including, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and, echinoderms, specific, tissues, are, targets, in, different, species, including, the, gills, brain, blood, kidney, and, liver, hepatopancreas, physiological, effects, have, been, reported, in, these, species, mn, can, affect, the, renewal, of, immunocytes, and, their, functionality, such, as, phagocytosis, and, activation, of, pro, phenoloxidase, suppressing, the, organisms, immune, systems, this, causes, the, organisms, to, be, more, susceptible, to, infections, as, climate, change, occurs, pathogen, distributions, increase, and, in, order, for, organisms, to, survive, and, defend, themselves, against, these, pathogens, they, need, a, healthy, strong, immune, system, if, their, systems, are, compromised, from, high, mn, levels, they, will, not, be, able, to, fight, off, these, pathogens, and, die, methylcyclopentadienyl, manganese, tricarbonyl, mmt, is, an, additive, developed, to, replace, lead, compounds, for, gasolines, to, improve, the, octane, rating, mmt, is, used, only, in, a, few, countries, fuels, containing, manganese, tend, to, form, manganese, carbides, which, damage, exhaust, valves, compared, to, 1953, levels, of, manganese, in, air, have, dropped, generally, exposure, to, ambient, mn, air, concentrations, in, excess, of, 5, g, mn, m, 3, can, lead, to, mn, induced, symptoms, increased, ferroportin, protein, expression, in, human, embryonic, kidney, hek293, cells, is, associated, with, decreased, intracellular, mn, concentration, and, attenuated, cytotoxicity, characterized, by, the, reversal, of, mn, reduced, glutamate, uptake, and, diminished, lactate, dehydrogenase, leakage, manganese, exposure, in, united, states, is, regulated, by, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, people, can, be, exposed, to, manganese, in, the, workplace, by, breathing, it, in, or, swallowing, it, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, manganese, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 5, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 1, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, and, a, short, term, limit, of, 3, mg, m, 3, at, levels, of, 500, mg, m, 3, manganese, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, manganese, is, essential, for, human, health, albeit, in, milligram, amounts, the, current, maximum, safe, concentration, under, u, s, epa, rules, is, 50, g, mn, l, manganese, overexposure, is, most, frequently, associated, with, manganism, a, rare, neurological, disorder, associated, with, excessive, manganese, ingestion, or, inhalation, historically, persons, employed, in, the, production, or, processing, of, manganese, alloys, have, been, at, risk, for, developing, manganism, however, health, and, safety, regulations, protect, workers, in, developed, nations, the, disorder, was, first, described, in, 1837, by, british, academic, john, couper, who, studied, two, patients, who, were, manganese, grinders, manganism, is, a, biphasic, disorder, in, its, early, stages, an, intoxicated, person, may, experience, depression, mood, swings, compulsive, behaviors, and, psychosis, early, neurological, symptoms, give, way, to, late, stage, manganism, which, resembles, parkinson, s, disease, symptoms, include, weakness, monotone, and, slowed, speech, an, expressionless, face, tremor, forward, leaning, gait, inability, to, walk, backwards, without, falling, rigidity, and, general, problems, with, dexterity, gait, and, balance, unlike, parkinson, s, disease, manganism, is, not, associated, with, loss, of, the, sense, of, smell, and, patients, are, typically, unresponsive, to, treatment, with, l, dopa, symptoms, of, late, stage, manganism, become, more, severe, over, time, even, if, the, source, of, exposure, is, removed, and, brain, manganese, levels, return, to, normal, chronic, manganese, exposure, has, been, shown, to, produce, a, parkinsonism, like, illness, characterized, by, movement, abnormalities, this, condition, is, not, responsive, to, typical, therapies, used, in, the, treatment, of, pd, suggesting, an, alternative, pathway, than, the, typical, dopaminergic, loss, within, the, substantia, nigra, manganese, may, accumulate, in, the, basal, ganglia, leading, to, the, abnormal, movements, a, mutation, of, the, slc30a10, gene, a, manganese, efflux, transporter, necessary, for, decreasing, intracellular, mn, has, been, linked, with, the, development, of, this, parkinsonism, like, disease, the, lewy, bodies, typical, to, pd, are, not, seen, in, mn, induced, parkinsonism, animal, experiments, have, given, the, opportunity, to, examine, the, consequences, of, manganese, overexposure, under, controlled, conditions, in, non, aggressive, rats, manganese, induces, mouse, killing, behavior, manganese, compounds, are, less, toxic, than, those, of, other, widespread, metals, such, as, nickel, and, copper, however, exposure, to, manganese, dusts, and, fumes, should, not, exceed, the, ceiling, value, of, 5, mg, m, 3, even, for, short, periods, because, of, its, toxicity, level, manganese, poisoning, has, been, linked, to, impaired, motor, skills, and, cognitive, disorders, a, protein, called, dmt1, is, the, major, transporter, in, manganese, absorption, from, the, intestine, and, may, be, the, major, transporter, of, manganese, across, the, blood, brain, barrier, dmt1, also, transports, inhaled, manganese, across, the, nasal, epithelium, the, proposed, mechanism, for, manganese, toxicity, is, that, dysregulation, leads, to, oxidative, stress, mitochondrial, dysfunction, glutamate, mediated, excitotoxicity, and, aggregation, of, proteins
