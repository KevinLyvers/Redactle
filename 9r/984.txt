angular, momentum, sometimes, called, moment, of, momentum, or, rotational, momentum, is, the, rotational, analog, of, linear, momentum, it, is, an, important, physical, quantity, because, it, is, a, conserved, quantity, the, total, angular, momentum, of, a, closed, system, remains, constant, angular, momentum, has, both, a, direction, and, a, magnitude, and, both, are, conserved, bicycles, and, motorcycles, flying, discs, rifled, bullets, and, gyroscopes, owe, their, useful, properties, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, conservation, of, angular, momentum, is, also, why, hurricanes, form, spirals, and, neutron, stars, have, high, rotational, rates, in, general, conservation, limits, the, possible, motion, of, a, system, but, it, does, not, uniquely, determine, it, the, three, dimensional, angular, momentum, for, a, point, particle, is, classically, represented, as, a, pseudovector, r, p, the, cross, product, of, the, particle, s, position, vector, r, relative, to, some, origin, and, its, momentum, vector, the, latter, is, p, m, v, in, newtonian, mechanics, unlike, linear, momentum, angular, momentum, depends, on, where, this, origin, is, chosen, since, the, particle, s, position, is, measured, from, it, angular, momentum, is, an, extensive, quantity, that, is, the, total, angular, momentum, of, any, composite, system, is, the, sum, of, the, angular, momenta, of, its, constituent, parts, for, a, continuous, rigid, body, or, a, fluid, the, total, angular, momentum, is, the, volume, integral, of, angular, momentum, density, angular, momentum, per, unit, volume, in, the, limit, as, volume, shrinks, to, zero, over, the, entire, body, similar, to, conservation, of, linear, momentum, where, it, is, conserved, if, there, is, no, external, force, angular, momentum, is, conserved, if, there, is, no, external, torque, torque, can, be, defined, as, the, rate, of, change, of, angular, momentum, analogous, to, force, the, net, external, torque, on, any, system, is, always, equal, to, the, total, torque, on, the, system, the, sum, of, all, internal, torques, of, any, system, is, always, 0, this, is, the, rotational, analogue, of, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, therefore, for, a, closed, system, where, there, is, no, net, external, torque, the, total, torque, on, the, system, must, be, 0, which, means, that, the, total, angular, momentum, of, the, system, is, constant, the, change, in, angular, momentum, for, a, particular, interaction, is, called, angular, impulse, sometimes, twirl, angular, impulse, is, the, angular, analog, of, linear, impulse, the, trivial, case, of, the, angular, momentum, l, displaystyle, l, of, a, body, in, an, orbit, is, given, by, l, 2, m, f, r, 2, displaystyle, l, 2, pi, mfr, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, orbiting, object, f, displaystyle, f, is, the, orbit, s, frequency, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, orbit, s, radius, the, angular, momentum, l, displaystyle, l, of, a, uniform, rigid, sphere, rotating, around, its, axis, instead, is, given, by, l, 4, 5, m, f, r, 2, displaystyle, l, frac, 4, 5, pi, mfr, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, sphere, s, mass, f, displaystyle, f, is, the, frequency, of, rotation, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, sphere, s, radius, thus, for, example, the, orbital, angular, momentum, of, the, earth, with, respect, to, the, sun, is, about, 2, 66, 10, 40, kg, m, 2, s, 1, while, its, rotational, angular, momentum, is, about, 7, 05, 10, 33, kg, m, 2, s, 1, in, the, case, of, a, uniform, rigid, sphere, rotating, around, its, axis, if, instead, of, its, mass, its, density, is, known, the, angular, momentum, l, displaystyle, l, is, given, by, l, 16, 15, 2, f, r, 5, displaystyle, l, frac, 16, 15, pi, 2, rho, fr, 5, where, displaystyle, rho, is, the, sphere, s, density, f, displaystyle, f, is, the, frequency, of, rotation, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, sphere, s, radius, in, the, simplest, case, of, a, spinning, disk, the, angular, momentum, l, displaystyle, l, is, given, by, l, m, f, r, 2, displaystyle, l, pi, mfr, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, disk, s, mass, f, displaystyle, f, is, the, frequency, of, rotation, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, disk, s, radius, if, instead, the, disk, rotates, about, its, diameter, e, g, coin, toss, its, angular, momentum, l, displaystyle, l, is, given, by, l, 1, 2, m, f, r, 2, displaystyle, l, frac, 1, 2, pi, mfr, 2, just, as, for, angular, velocity, there, are, two, special, types, of, angular, momentum, of, an, object, the, spin, angular, momentum, is, the, angular, momentum, about, the, object, s, centre, of, mass, while, the, orbital, angular, momentum, is, the, angular, momentum, about, a, chosen, center, of, rotation, the, earth, has, an, orbital, angular, momentum, by, nature, of, revolving, around, the, sun, and, a, spin, angular, momentum, by, nature, of, its, daily, rotation, around, the, polar, axis, the, total, angular, momentum, is, the, sum, of, the, spin, and, orbital, angular, momenta, in, the, case, of, the, earth, the, primary, conserved, quantity, is, the, total, angular, momentum, of, the, solar, system, because, angular, momentum, is, exchanged, to, a, small, but, important, extent, among, the, planets, and, the, sun, the, orbital, angular, momentum, vector, of, a, point, particle, is, always, parallel, and, directly, proportional, to, its, orbital, angular, velocity, vector, where, the, constant, of, proportionality, depends, on, both, the, mass, of, the, particle, and, its, distance, from, origin, the, spin, angular, momentum, vector, of, a, rigid, body, is, proportional, but, not, always, parallel, to, the, spin, angular, velocity, vector, making, the, constant, of, proportionality, a, second, rank, tensor, rather, than, a, scalar, angular, momentum, is, a, vector, quantity, more, precisely, a, pseudovector, that, represents, the, product, of, a, body, s, rotational, inertia, and, rotational, velocity, in, radians, sec, about, a, particular, axis, however, if, the, particle, s, trajectory, lies, in, a, single, plane, it, is, sufficient, to, discard, the, vector, nature, of, angular, momentum, and, treat, it, as, a, scalar, more, precisely, a, pseudoscalar, angular, momentum, can, be, considered, a, rotational, analog, of, linear, momentum, thus, where, linear, momentum, p, is, proportional, to, mass, m, and, linear, speed, v, p, m, v, displaystyle, p, mv, angular, momentum, l, is, proportional, to, moment, of, inertia, i, and, angular, speed, measured, in, radians, per, second, l, i, displaystyle, l, i, omega, unlike, mass, which, depends, only, on, amount, of, matter, moment, of, inertia, depends, also, on, the, position, of, the, axis, of, rotation, and, the, distribution, of, the, matter, unlike, linear, velocity, which, does, not, depend, upon, the, choice, of, origin, orbital, angular, velocity, is, always, measured, with, respect, to, a, fixed, origin, therefore, strictly, speaking, l, should, be, referred, to, as, the, angular, momentum, relative, to, that, center, in, the, case, of, circular, motion, of, a, single, particle, we, can, use, i, r, 2, m, displaystyle, i, r, 2, m, and, v, r, displaystyle, omega, v, r, to, expand, angular, momentum, as, l, r, 2, m, v, r, displaystyle, l, r, 2, m, cdot, v, r, reducing, to, l, r, m, v, displaystyle, l, rmv, the, product, of, the, radius, of, rotation, r, and, the, linear, momentum, of, the, particle, p, m, v, displaystyle, p, mv, where, v, r, displaystyle, v, r, omega, is, the, linear, tangential, speed, this, simple, analysis, can, also, apply, to, non, circular, motion, if, one, uses, the, component, of, the, motion, perpendicular, to, the, radius, vector, l, r, m, v, displaystyle, l, rmv, perp, where, v, v, sin, displaystyle, v, perp, v, sin, theta, is, the, perpendicular, component, of, the, motion, expanding, l, r, m, v, sin, displaystyle, l, rmv, sin, theta, rearranging, l, r, sin, m, v, displaystyle, l, r, sin, theta, mv, and, reducing, angular, momentum, can, also, be, expressed, l, r, m, v, displaystyle, l, r, perp, mv, where, r, r, sin, displaystyle, r, perp, r, sin, theta, is, the, length, of, the, moment, arm, a, line, dropped, perpendicularly, from, the, origin, onto, the, path, of, the, particle, it, is, this, definition, length, of, moment, arm, linear, momentum, to, which, the, term, moment, of, momentum, refers, another, approach, is, to, define, angular, momentum, as, the, conjugate, momentum, also, called, canonical, momentum, of, the, angular, coordinate, displaystyle, phi, expressed, in, the, lagrangian, of, the, mechanical, system, consider, a, mechanical, system, with, a, mass, m, displaystyle, m, constrained, to, move, in, a, circle, of, radius, r, displaystyle, r, in, the, absence, of, any, external, force, field, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, system, is, t, 1, 2, m, r, 2,

is, defined, by, p, l, m, r, 2, i, l, displaystyle, p, phi, frac, partial, mathcal, l, partial, dot, phi, mr, 2, dot, phi, i, omega, l, to, completely, define, orbital, angular, momentum, in, three, dimensions, it, is, required, to, know, the, rate, at, which, the, position, vector, sweeps, out, angle, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, instantaneous, plane, of, angular, displacement, and, the, mass, involved, as, well, as, how, this, mass, is, distributed, in, space, by, retaining, this, vector, nature, of, angular, momentum, the, general, nature, of, the, equations, is, also, retained, and, can, describe, any, sort, of, three, dimensional, motion, about, the, center, of, rotation, circular, linear, or, otherwise, in, vector, notation, the, orbital, angular, momentum, of, a, point, particle, in, motion, about, the, origin, can, be, expressed, as, l, i, displaystyle, mathbf, l, i, boldsymbol, omega, where, this, can, be, expanded, reduced, and, by, the, rules, of,

perpendicular, to, both, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, it, is, directed, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, angular, displacement, as, indicated, by, the, right, hand, rule, so, that, the, angular, velocity, is, seen, as, counter, clockwise, from, the, head, of, the, vector, conversely, the, l, displaystyle, mathbf, l, vector, defines, the, plane, in, which, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, lie, by, defining, a, unit, vector, u, displaystyle, mathbf, hat, u, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, angular, displacement, a, scalar,

spherical, coordinate, system, the, angular, momentum, vector, expresses, as, angular, momentum, can, be, described, as, the, rotational, analog, of, linear, momentum, like, linear, momentum, it, involves, elements, of, mass, and, displacement, unlike, linear, momentum, it, also, involves, elements, of, position, and, shape, many, problems, in, physics, involve, matter, in, motion, about, some, certain, point, in, space, be, it, in, actual, rotation, about, it, or, simply, moving, past, it, where, it, is, desired, to, know, what, effect, the, moving, matter, has, on, the, point, can, it, exert, energy, upon, it, or, perform, work, about, it, energy, the, ability, to, do, work, can, be, stored, in, matter, by, setting, it, in, motion, a, combination, of, its, inertia, and, its, displacement, inertia, is, measured, by, its, mass, and, displacement, by, its, velocity, their, product, amount, of, inertia, amount, of, displacement, amount, of, inertia, displacement, mass,

point, directly, for, instance, a, particle, of, matter, at, the, outer, edge, of, a, wheel, is, in, effect, at, the, end, of, a, lever, of, the, same, length, as, the, wheel, s, radius, its, momentum, turning, the, lever, about, the, center, point, this, imaginary, lever, is, known, as, the, moment, arm, it, has, the, effect, of, multiplying, the, momentum, s, effort, in, proportion, to, its, length, an, effect, known, as, a, moment, hence, the, particle, s, momentum, referred, to, a, particular, point, moment, arm, amount, of, inertia, amount, of, displacement, moment, of, inertia,

moment, of, inertia, displacement, text, length, times, text, mass, times, text, velocity, text, moment, of, momentum, r, times, m, times, v, l, end, aligned, is, the, angular, momentum, sometimes, called, as, here, the, moment, of, momentum, of, the, particle, versus, that, particular, center, point, the, equation, l, r, m, v, displaystyle, l, rmv, combines, a, moment, a, mass, m, displaystyle, m, turning, moment, arm, r, displaystyle, r, with, a, linear, straight, line, equivalent, speed, v, displaystyle, v, linear, speed, referred, to, the, central, point, is, simply, the, product, of, the, distance, r, displaystyle, r, and, the, angular, speed, displaystyle, omega, versus, the, point, v, r, displaystyle, v, r, omega, another, moment, hence, angular, momentum, contains, a, double, moment, l, r, m, r, displaystyle, l, rmr, omega, simplifying, slightly, l, r, 2, m, displaystyle, l, r, 2, m, omega, the, quantity, r, 2, m, displaystyle, r, 2, m, is, the, particle, s, moment, of, inertia, sometimes, called, the, second, moment, of, mass, it, is, a, measure, of, rotational, inertia, the, above, analogy, of, the, translational, momentum, and, rotational, momentum, can, be, expressed, in, vector, form, the, direction, of, momentum, is, related, to, the, direction, of, the, velocity, for, linear, movement, the, direction, of, angular, momentum, is, related, to, the, angular, velocity, of, the, rotation, because, moment, of, inertia, is, a, crucial, part, of, the, spin, angular, momentum, the, latter, necessarily, includes, all, of, the, complications, of, the, former, which, is, calculated, by, multiplying, elementary, bits, of, the, mass, by, the, squares, of, their, distances, from, the, center, of, rotation, therefore, the, total, moment, of, inertia, and, the, angular, momentum, is, a, complex, function, of, the, configuration, of, the, matter, about, the, center, of, rotation, and, the, orientation, of, the, rotation, for, the, various, bits, for, a, rigid, body, for, instance, a, wheel, or, an, asteroid, the, orientation, of, rotation, is, simply, the, position, of, the, rotation, axis, versus, the, matter, of, the, body, it, may, or, may, not, pass, through, the, center, of, mass, or, it, may, lie, completely, outside, of, the, body, for, the, same, body, angular, momentum, may, take, a, different, value, for, every, possible, axis, about, which, rotation, may, take, place, it, reaches, a, minimum, when, the, axis, passes, through, the, center, of, mass, for, a, collection, of, objects, revolving, about, a, center, for, instance, all, of, the, bodies, of, the, solar, system, the, orientations, may, be, somewhat, organized, as, is, the, solar, system, with, most, of, the, bodies, axes, lying, close, to, the, system, s, axis, their, orientations, may, also, be, completely, random, in, brief, the, more, mass, and, the, farther, it, is, from, the, center, of, rotation, the, longer, the, moment, arm, the, greater, the, moment, of, inertia, and, therefore, the, greater, the, angular, momentum, for, a, given, angular, velocity, in, many, cases, the, moment, of, inertia, and, hence, the, angular, momentum, can, be, simplified, by, i, k, 2, m, displaystyle, i, k, 2, m, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, the, radius, of, gyration, the, distance, from, the, axis, at, which, the, entire, mass, m, displaystyle, m, may, be, considered, as, concentrated, similarly, for, a, point, mass, m, displaystyle, m, the, moment, of, inertia, is, defined, as, i, r, 2, m, displaystyle, i, r, 2, m, where, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, radius, of, the, point, mass, from, the, center, of, rotation, and, for, any, collection, of, particles, m, i, displaystyle, m, i, as, the, sum, i, i, i, i, r, i, 2, m, i, displaystyle, sum, i, i, i, sum, i, r, i, 2, m, i, angular, momentum, s, dependence, on, position, and, shape, is, reflected, in, its, units, versus, linear, momentum, kg, m, 2, s, or, n, m, s, for, angular, momentum, versus, kg, m, s, or, n, s, for, linear, momentum, when, calculating, angular, momentum, as, the, product, of, the, moment, of, inertia, times, the, angular, velocity, the, angular, velocity, must, be, expressed, in, radians, per, second, where, the, radian, assumes, the, dimensionless, value, of, unity, when, performing, dimensional, analysis, it, may, be, productive, to, use, orientational, analysis, which, treats, radians, as, a, base, unit, but, this, is, not, done, in, the, international, system, of, units, the, units, if, angular, momentum, can, be, interpreted, as, torque, time, an, object, with, angular, momentum, of, l, n, m, s, can, be, reduced, to, zero, angular, velocity, by, an, angular, impulse, of, l, n, m, s, the, plane, perpendicular, to, the, axis, of, angular, momentum, and, passing, through, the, center, of, mass, is, sometimes, called, the, invariable, plane, because, the, direction, of, the, axis, remains, fixed, if, only, the, interactions, of, the, bodies, within, the, system, free, from, outside, influences, are, considered, one, such, plane, is, the, invariable, plane, of, the, solar, system, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, can, be, expressed, mathematically, f, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, a, or, force, mass, acceleration, the, rotational, equivalent, for, point, particles, may, be, derived, as, follows, l, i, displaystyle, mathbf, l, i, boldsymbol, omega, which, means, that, the, torque, i, e, the, time, derivative, of, the, angular, momentum, is, d, i, d, t, i, d, d, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, frac, di, dt, boldsymbol, omega, i, frac, d, boldsymbol, omega, dt, because, the, moment, of, inertia, is, m, r, 2, displaystyle, mr, 2, it, follows, that, d, i, d, t, 2, m, r, d, r, d, t, 2, r, p, displaystyle, frac, di, dt, 2mr, frac, dr, dt, 2rp, and, d, l, d, t, i, d, d, t, 2, r, p, displaystyle, frac, d, mathbf, l, dt, i, frac, d, boldsymbol, omega, dt, 2rp, boldsymbol, omega, which, reduces, to, i, 2, r, p, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, i, boldsymbol, alpha, 2rp, boldsymbol, omega, this, is, the, rotational, analog, of, newton, s, second, law, note, that, the, torque, is, not, necessarily, proportional, or, parallel, to, the, angular, acceleration, as, one, might, expect, the, reason, for, this, is, that, the, moment, of, inertia, of, a, particle, can, change, with, time, something, that, cannot, occur, for, ordinary, mass, a, rotational, analog, of, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, might, be, written, in, a, closed, system, no, torque, can, be, exerted, on, any, matter, without, the, exertion, on, some, other, matter, of, an, equal, and, opposite, torque, about, the, same, axis, hence, angular, momentum, can, be, exchanged, between, objects, in, a, closed, system, but, total, angular, momentum, before, and, after, an, exchange, remains, constant, is, conserved, seen, another, way, a, rotational, analogue, of, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, might, be, written, a, rigid, body, continues, in, a, state, of, uniform, rotation, unless, acted, upon, by, an, external, influence, thus, with, no, external, influence, to, act, upon, it, the, original, angular, momentum, of, the, system, remains, constant, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, is, used, in, analyzing, central, force, motion, if, the, net, force, on, some, body, is, directed, always, toward, some, point, the, center, then, there, is, no, torque, on, the, body, with, respect, to, the, center, as, all, of, the, force, is, directed, along, the, radius, vector, and, none, is, perpendicular, to, the, radius, mathematically, torque, r, f, 0, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, mathbf, 0, because, in, this, case, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, are, parallel, vectors, therefore, the, angular, momentum, of, the, body, about, the, center, is, constant, this, is, the, case, with, gravitational, attraction, in, the, orbits, of, planets, and, satellites, where, the, gravitational, force, is, always, directed, toward, the, primary, body, and, orbiting, bodies, conserve, angular, momentum, by, exchanging, distance, and, velocity, as, they, move, about, the, primary, central, force, motion, is, also, used, in, the, analysis, of, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, for, a, planet, angular, momentum, is, distributed, between, the, spin, of, the, planet, and, its, revolution, in, its, orbit, and, these, are, often, exchanged, by, various, mechanisms, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, in, the, earth, moon, system, results, in, the, transfer, of, angular, momentum, from, earth, to, moon, due, to, tidal, torque, the, moon, exerts, on, the, earth, this, in, turn, results, in, the, slowing, down, of, the, rotation, rate, of, earth, at, about, 65, 7, nanoseconds, per, day, and, in, gradual, increase, of, the, radius, of, moon, s, orbit, at, about, 3, 82, centimeters, per, year, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, explains, the, angular, acceleration, of, an, ice, skater, as, they, bring, their, arms, and, legs, close, to, the, vertical, axis, of, rotation, by, bringing, part, of, the, mass, of, their, body, closer, to, the, axis, they, decrease, their, body, s, moment, of, inertia, because, angular, momentum, is, the, product, of, moment, of, inertia, and, angular, velocity, if, the, angular, momentum, remains, constant, is, conserved, then, the, angular, velocity, rotational, speed, of, the, skater, must, increase, the, same, phenomenon, results, in, extremely, fast, spin, of, compact, stars, like, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, when, they, are, formed, out, of, much, larger, and, slower, rotating, stars, conservation, is, not, always, a, full, explanation, for, the, dynamics, of, a, system, but, is, a, key, constraint, for, example, a, spinning, top, is, subject, to, gravitational, torque, making, it, lean, over, and, change, the, angular, momentum, about, the, nutation, axis, but, neglecting, friction, at, the, point, of, spinning, contact, it, has, a, conserved, angular, momentum, about, its, spinning, axis, and, another, about, its, precession, axis, also, in, any, planetary, system, the, planets, star, s, comets, and, asteroids, can, all, move, in, numerous, complicated, ways, but, only, so, that, the, angular, momentum, of, the, system, is, conserved, noether, s, theorem, states, that, every, conservation, law, is, associated, with, a, symmetry, invariant, of, the, underlying, physics, the, symmetry, associated, with, conservation, of, angular, momentum, is, rotational, invariance, the, fact, that, the, physics, of, a, system, is, unchanged, if, it, is, rotated, by, any, angle, about, an, axis, implies, that, angular, momentum, is, conserved, while, angular, momentum, total, conservation, can, be, understood, separately, from, newton, s, laws, of, motion, as, stemming, from, noether, s, theorem, in, systems, symmetric, under, rotations, it, can, also, be, understood, simply, as, an, efficient, method, of, calculation, of, results, that, can, also, be, otherwise, arrived, at, directly, from, newton, s, second, law, together, with, laws, governing, the, forces, of, nature, such, as, newton, s, third, law, maxwell, s, equations, and, lorentz, force, indeed, given, initial, conditions, of, position, and, velocity, for, every, point, and, the, forces, at, such, a, condition, one, may, use, newton, s, second, law, to, calculate, the, second, derivative, of, position, and, solving, for, this, gives, full, information, on, the, development, of, the, physical, system, with, time, note, however, that, this, is, no, longer, true, in, quantum, mechanics, due, to, the, existence, of, particle, spin, which, is, angular, momentum, that, cannot, be, described, by, the, cumulative, effect, of, point, like, motions, in, space, as, an, example, consider, decreasing, of, the, moment, of, inertia, e, g, when, a, figure, skater, is, pulling, in, their, hands, speeding, up, the, circular, motion, in, terms, of, angular, momentum, conservation, we, have, for, angular, momentum, l, moment, of, inertia, i, and, angular, velocity, 0, d, l, d, i, d, i, i, d, displaystyle, 0, dl, d, i, cdot, omega, di, cdot, omega, i, cdot, d, omega, using, this, we, see, that, the, change, requires, an, energy, of, d, e, d, 1, 2, i, 2, 1, 2, d, i, 2, i, d, 1, 2, d, i, 2, displaystyle, de, d, left, tfrac, 1, 2, i, cdot, omega, 2, right, tfrac, 1, 2, di, cdot, omega, 2, i, cdot, omega, cdot, d, omega, tfrac, 1, 2, di, cdot, omega, 2, so, that, a, decrease, in, the, moment, of, inertia, requires, investing, energy, this, can, be, compared, to, the, work, done, as, calculated, using, newton, s, laws, each, point, in, the, rotating, body, is, accelerating, at, each, point, of, time, with, radial, acceleration, of, r, 2, displaystyle, r, cdot, omega, 2, let, us, observe, a, point, of, mass, m, whose, position, vector, relative, to, the, center, of, motion, is, perpendicular, to, the, z, axis, at, a, given, point, of, time, and, is, at, a, distance, z, the, centripetal, force, on, this, point, keeping, the, circular, motion, is, m, z, 2, displaystyle, m, cdot, z, cdot, omega, 2, thus, the, work, required, for, moving, this, point, to, a, distance, dz, farther, from, the, center, of, motion, is, d, w, m, z, 2, d, z, m, 2, d, 1, 2, z, 2, displaystyle, dw, m, cdot, z, cdot, omega, 2, cdot, dz, m, cdot, omega, 2, cdot, d, left, tfrac, 1, 2, z, 2, right, for, a, non, pointlike, body, one, must, integrate, over, this, with, m, replaced, by, the, mass, density, per, unit, z, this, gives, d, w, 1, 2, d, i, 2, displaystyle, dw, tfrac, 1, 2, di, cdot, omega, 2, which, is, exactly, the, energy, required, for, keeping, the, angular, momentum, conserved, note, that, the, above, calculation, can, also, be, performed, per, mass, using, kinematics, only, thus, the, phenomena, of, figure, skater, accelerating, tangential, velocity, while, pulling, their, hands, in, can, be, understood, as, follows, in, layman, s, language, the, skater, s, palms, are, not, moving, in, a, straight, line, so, they, are, constantly, accelerating, inwards, but, do, not, gain, additional, speed, because, the, accelerating, is, always, done, when, their, motion, inwards, is, zero, however, this, is, different, when, pulling, the, palms, closer, to, the, body, the, acceleration, due, to, rotation, now, increases, the, speed, but, because, of, the, rotation, the, increase, in, speed, does, not, translate, to, a, significant, speed, inwards, but, to, an, increase, of, the, rotation, speed, in, classical, mechanics, it, can, be, shown, that, the, rotational, invariance, of, action, functional, implies, conservation, of, angular, momentum, the, action, is, defined, in, classical, physics, as, a, functional, of, positions, x, i, t, displaystyle, x, i, t, often, represented, by, the, use, of, square, brackets, and, the, final, and, initial, times, it, assumes, the, following, form, in, cartesian, coordinates, s, x, i, t, 1, t, 2, t, 1, t, 2, d, t, 1, 2, m, d, x, i, d, t, d, x, i, d, t, v,

angular, momentum, for, rotation, around, a, given, axis, is, the, conjugate, momentum, of, the, generalized, coordinate, of, the, angle, around, the, same, axis, for, example, l, z, displaystyle, l, z, the, angular, momentum, around, the, z, axis, is, l, z, l, z, displaystyle, l, z, frac, partial, cal, l, partial, dot, theta, z, where, l, displaystyle, cal, l, is, the, lagrangian, and, z,

ordinarily, the, lagrangian, depends, on, the, angular, velocity, through, the, kinetic, energy, the, latter, can, be, written, by, separating, the, velocity, to, its, radial, and, tangential, part, with, the, tangential, part, at, the, x, y, plane, around, the, z, axis, being, equal, to, i, 1, 2, m, i, v, t, i, 2, i, 1, 2, m, i, x, i, 2, y, i, 2, z, i, 2, displaystyle, sum, i, tfrac, 1, 2, m, i,

velocity, around, the, z, axis, and, angular, velocity, around, that, axis, respectively, for, a, body, that, is, not, point, like, with, density, we, have, instead, 1, 2, x, y, z, x, i, 2, y, i, 2,

integration, runs, over, the, area, of, the, body, and, i, z, is, the, moment, of, inertia, around, the, z, axis, thus, assuming, the, potential, energy, does, not, depend, on, z, this, assumption, may, fail, for, electromagnetic, systems, we, have, the, angular, momentum, of, the, i, th, object, l, z, i, l, z, i, e, k, z, i, i, z, i, z, i, displaystyle, begin, aligned, l, z, i, frac, partial, cal, l, partial, omega, z, i, frac, partial, e, k, partial, omega, z, i, i, z, i, cdot, omega, z, i, end, aligned, we, have, thus, far, rotated, each, object, by, a, separate, angle, we, may, also, define, an, overall, angle, z, by, which, we, rotate, the, whole, system, thus, rotating, also, each, object, around, the, z, axis, and, have, the, overall, angular, momentum, l, z, i, i, z, i, z, i, displaystyle, l, z, sum, i, i, z, i, cdot, omega, z, i, from, euler, lagrange, equations, it, then, follows, that, 0, l, z, i, d, d, t, l, z, i, l, z, i, d, l, z, i, d, t, displaystyle, 0, frac,

lagrangian, is, dependent, upon, the, angles, of, the, object, only, through, the, potential, we, have, d, l, z, i, d, t, l, z, i, v, z, i, displaystyle, frac, d, l, z, i, dt, frac, partial, cal, l, partial, theta, z, i, frac, partial, v, partial, theta, z, i, which, is, the, torque, on, the, i, th, object, suppose, the, system, is, invariant, to, rotations, so, that, the, potential, is, independent, of, an, overall, rotation, by, the, angle, z, thus, it, may, depend, on, the, angles, of, objects, only, through, their, differences, in, the, form, v, z, i, z, j, v, z, i, z, j, displaystyle, v, theta, z, i, theta, z, j, v, theta, z, i, theta, z, j, we, therefore, get, for, the, total, angular, momentum, d, l, z, d, t, v, z, 0, displaystyle, frac, dl, z, dt, frac, partial, v, partial, theta, z, 0, and, thus, the, angular, momentum, around, the, z, axis, is, conserved, this, analysis, can, be, repeated, separately, for, each, axis, giving, conversation, of, the, angular, momentum, vector, however, the, angles, around, the, three, axes, cannot, be, treated, simultaneously, as, generalized, coordinates, since, they, are, not, independent, in, particular, two, angles, per, point, suffice, to, determine, its, position, while, it, is, true, that, in, the, case, of, a, rigid, body, fully, describing, it, requires, in, addition, to, three, translational, degrees, of, freedom, also, specification, of, three, rotational, degrees, of, freedom, however, these, cannot, be, defined, as, rotations, around, the, cartesian, axes, see, euler, angles, this, caveat, is, reflected, in, quantum, mechanics, in, the, non, trivial, commutation, relations, of, the, different, components, of, the, angular, momentum, operator, equivalently, in, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, hamiltonian, can, be, described, as, a, function, of, the, angular, momentum, as, before, the, part, of, the, kinetic, energy, related, to, rotation, around, the, z, axis, for, the, i, th, object, is,

i, z, i, z, i, displaystyle, l, z, i, i, z, i, cdot, dot, theta, z, i, i, z, i, cdot, omega, z, i, and, so, we, get, the, same, results, as, in, the, lagrangian, formalism, note, that, for, combining, all, axes, together, we, write, the, kinetic, energy, as, e, k, 1, 2, i, p, i, 2, 2, m, i, i, p, r, i, 2, 2, m, i, 1, 2, l, i, t, i, i, 1, l, i, displaystyle, e, k, frac, 1, 2, sum, i, frac, bf, p, i,

is, a, 3, dimensional, matrix, bold, letters, stand, for, 3, dimensional, vectors, for, point, like, bodies, we, have, e, k, i, p, r, i, 2, 2, m, i, l, i, 2, 2, m, i, r, i, 2, displaystyle, e, k, sum, i, left, frac, p, r, i, 2, 2m, i, frac, bf, l, i, 2, 2m, i, r, i, 2, right, this, form, of, the, kinetic, energy, part, of, the, hamiltonian, is, useful, in, analyzing, central, potential, problems, and, is, easily, transformed, to, a, quantum, mechanical, work, frame, e, g, in, the, hydrogen, atom, problem, while, in, classical, mechanics, the, language, of, angular, momentum, can, be, replaced, by, newton, s, laws, of, motion, it, is, particularly, useful, for, motion, in, central, potential, such, as, planetary, motion, in, the, solar, system, thus, the, orbit, of, a, planet, in, the, solar, system, is, defined, by, its, energy, angular, momentum, and, angles, of, the, orbit, major, axis, relative, to, a, coordinate, frame, in, astrodynamics, and, celestial, mechanics, a, quantity, closely, related, to, angular, momentum, is, defined, as, h, r, v, displaystyle, mathbf, h, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, v, called, specific, angular, momentum, note, that, l, m, h, displaystyle, mathbf, l, m, mathbf, h, mass, is, often, unimportant, in, orbital, mechanics, calculations, because, motion, of, a, body, is, determined, by, gravity, the, primary, body, of, the, system, is, often, so, much, larger, than, any, bodies, in, motion, about, it, that, the, gravitational, effect, of, the, smaller, bodies, on, it, can, be, neglected, it, maintains, in, effect, constant, velocity, the, motion, of, all, bodies, is, affected, by, its, gravity, in, the, same, way, regardless, of, mass, and, therefore, all, move, approximately, the, same, way, under, the, same, conditions, angular, momentum, is, also, an, extremely, useful, concept, for, describing, rotating, rigid, bodies, such, as, a, gyroscope, or, a, rocky, planet, for, a, continuous, mass, distribution, with, density, function, r, a, differential, volume, element, dv, with, position, vector, r, within, the, mass, has, a, mass, element, dm, r, dv, therefore, the, infinitesimal, angular, momentum, of, this, element,

in, motion, about, an, arbitrary, origin, it, is, informative, to, develop, the, equation, of, angular, momentum, by, resolving, their, motion, into, components, about, their, own, center, of, mass,

momentum, see, below, is, described, using, a, different, formalism, instead, of, a, classical, pseudovector, in, this, formalism, angular, momentum, is, the, 2, form, noether, charge, associated, with, rotational, invariance, as, a, result, angular, momentum, is, generally, not, conserved, locally, for, general, curved, spacetimes, unless, they, have, rotational, symmetry, whereas, globally, the, notion, of, angular, momentum, itself, only, makes, sense, if, the, spacetime, is, asymptotically, flat, if, the, spacetime, is, only, axially, symmetric, like, for, the, kerr, metric, the, total, angular, momentum, is, not, conserved, but, p, displaystyle, p, phi, is, conserved, which, is, related, to, the, invariance, of, rotating, around, the, symmetry, axis, where, note, that, p, g,

the, product, of, the, relativistic, mass, of, the, particle, and, its, centre, of, mass, which, can, be, thought, of, as, describing, the, motion, of, its, centre, of, mass, since, mass, energy, is, conserved, in, each, of, the, above, cases, for, a, system, of, particles, the, total, angular, momentum, is, just, the, sum, of, the, individual, particle, angular, momenta, and, the, centre, of, mass, is, for, the, system, in, quantum, mechanics, angular, momentum, like, other, quantities, is, expressed, as, an, operator, and, its, one, dimensional, projections, have, quantized, eigenvalues, angular, momentum, is, subject, to, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, implying, that, at, any, time, only, one, projection, also, called, component, can, be, measured, with, definite, precision, the, other, two, then, remain, uncertain, because, of, this, the, axis, of, rotation, of, a, quantum, particle, is, undefined, quantum, particles, do, possess, a, type, of, non, orbital, angular, momentum, called, spin, but, this, angular, momentum, does, not, correspond, to, a, spinning, motion, in, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, the, above, relativistic, definition, becomes, a, tensorial, operator, the, classical, definition, of, angular, momentum, as, l, r, p, displaystyle, mathbf, l, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, p, can, be, carried, over, to, quantum, mechanics, by, reinterpreting, r, as, the, quantum, position, operator, and, p, as, the, quantum, momentum, operator, l, is, then, an, operator, specifically, called, the, orbital, angular, momentum, operator, the, components, of, the, angular, momentum, operator, satisfy, the, commutation, relations, of, the, lie, algebra, so, 3, indeed, these, operators, are, precisely, the, infinitesimal, action, of, the, rotation, group, on, the, quantum, hilbert, space, see, also, the, discussion, below, of, the, angular, momentum, operators, as, the, generators, of, rotations, however, in, quantum, physics, there, is, another, type, of, angular, momentum, called, spin, angular, momentum, represented, by, the, spin, operator, s, spin, is, often, depicted, as, a, particle, literally, spinning, around, an, axis, but, this, is, a, misleading, and, inaccurate, picture, spin, is, an, intrinsic, property, of, a, particle, unrelated, to, any, sort, of, motion, in, space, and, fundamentally, different, from, orbital, angular, momentum, all, elementary, particles, have, a, characteristic, spin, possibly, zero, and, almost, all, elementary, particles, have, nonzero, spin, for, example, electrons, have, spin, 1, 2, this, actually, means, spin, 2, photons, have, spin, 1, this, actually, means, spin, and, pi, mesons, have, spin, 0, finally, there, is, total, angular, momentum, j, which, combines, both, the, spin, and, orbital, angular, momentum, of, all, particles, and, fields, for, one, particle, j, l, s, conservation, of, angular, momentum, applies, to, j, but, not, to, l, or, s, for, example, the, spin, orbit, interaction, allows, angular, momentum, to, transfer, back, and, forth, between, l, and, s, with, the, total, remaining, constant, electrons, and, photons, need, not, have, integer, based, values, for, total, angular, momentum, but, can, also, have, half, integer, values, in, molecules, the, total, angular, momentum, f, is, the, sum, of, the, rovibronic, orbital, angular, momentum, n, the, electron, spin, angular, momentum, s, and, the, nuclear, spin, angular, momentum, i, for, electronic, singlet, states, the, rovibronic, angular, momentum, is, denoted, j, rather, than, n, as, explained, by, van, vleck, the, components, of, the, molecular, rovibronic, angular, momentum, referred, to, molecule, fixed, axes, have, different, commutation, relations, from, those, for, the, components, about, space, fixed, axes, in, quantum, mechanics, angular, momentum, is, quantized, that, is, it, cannot, vary, continuously, but, only, in, quantum, leaps, between, certain, allowed, values, for, any, system, the, following, restrictions, on, measurement, results, apply, where, displaystyle, hbar, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, and, n, displaystyle, hat, n, is, any, euclidean, vector, such, as, x, y, or, z, the, reduced, planck, constant, displaystyle, hbar, is, tiny, by, everyday, standards, about, 10, 34, j, s, and, therefore, this, quantization, does, not, noticeably, affect, the, angular, momentum, of, macroscopic, objects, however, it, is, very, important, in, the, microscopic, world, for, example, the, structure, of, electron, shells, and, subshells, in, chemistry, is, significantly, affected, by, the, quantization, of, angular, momentum, quantization, of, angular, momentum, was, first, postulated, by, niels, bohr, in, his, model, of, the, atom, and, was, later, predicted, by, erwin, schr, dinger, in, his, schr, dinger, equation, in, the, definition, l, r, p, displaystyle, mathbf, l, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, p, six, operators, are, involved, the, position, operators, r, x, displaystyle, r, x, r, y, displaystyle, r, y, r, z, displaystyle, r, z, and, the, momentum, operators, p, x, displaystyle, p, x, p, y, displaystyle, p, y, p, z, displaystyle, p, z, however, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, tells, us, that, it, is, not, possible, for, all, six, of, these, quantities, to, be, known, simultaneously, with, arbitrary, precision, therefore, there, are, limits, to, what, can, be, known, or, measured, about, a, particle, s, angular, momentum, it, turns, out, that, the, best, that, one, can, do, is, to, simultaneously, measure, both, the, angular, momentum, vector, s, magnitude, and, its, component, along, one, axis, the, uncertainty, is, closely, related, to, the, fact, that, different, components, of, an, angular, momentum, operator, do, not, commute, for, example, l, x, l, y, l, y, l, x, displaystyle, l, x, l, y, neq, l, y, l, x, for, the, precise, commutation, relations, see, angular, momentum, operator, as, mentioned, above, orbital, angular, momentum, l, is, defined, as, in, classical, mechanics, l, r, p, displaystyle, mathbf, l, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, p, but, total, angular, momentum, j, is, defined, in, a, different, more, basic, way, j, is, defined, as, the, generator, of, rotations, more, specifically, j, is, defined, so, that, the, operator, r, n, exp, i, j, n, displaystyle, r, hat, n, phi, equiv, exp, left, frac, i, hbar, phi, mathbf, j, cdot, hat, mathbf, n, right, is, the, rotation, operator, that, takes, any, system, and, rotates, it, by, angle, displaystyle, phi, about, the, axis, n, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, n, the, exp, in, the, formula, refers, to, operator, exponential, to, put, this, the, other, way, around, whatever, our, quantum, hilbert, space, is, we, expect, that, the, rotation, group, so, 3, will, act, on, it, there, is, then, an, associated, action, of, the, lie, algebra, so, 3, of, so, 3, the, operators, describing, the, action, of, so, 3, on, our, hilbert, space, are, the, total, angular, momentum, operators, the, relationship, between, the, angular, momentum, operator, and, the, rotation, operators, is, the, same, as, the, relationship, between, lie, algebras, and, lie, groups, in, mathematics, the, close, relationship, between, angular, momentum, and, rotations, is, reflected, in, noether, s, theorem, that, proves, that, angular, momentum, is, conserved, whenever, the, laws, of, physics, are, rotationally, invariant, when, describing, the, motion, of, a, charged, particle, in, an, electromagnetic, field, the, canonical, momentum, p, derived, from, the, lagrangian, for, this, system, is, not, gauge, invariant, as, a, consequence, the, canonical, angular, momentum, l, r, p, is, not, gauge, invariant, either, instead, the, momentum, that, is, physical, the, so, called, kinetic, momentum, used, throughout, this, article, is, in, si, units, p, m, v, p, e, a, displaystyle, mathbf, p, m, mathbf, v, mathbf, p, e,

low, pressure, intensifies, and, the, slowly, circulating, air, is, drawn, toward, the, center, the, molecules, must, speed, up, in, order, to, conserve, angular, momentum, by, the, time, they, reach, the, center, the, speeds, become, destructive, johannes, kepler, determined, the, laws, of, planetary, motion, without, knowledge, of, conservation, of, momentum, however, not, long, after, his, discovery, their, derivation, was, determined, from, conservation, of, angular, momentum, planets, move, more, slowly, the, further, they, are, out, in, their, elliptical, orbits, which, is, explained, intuitively, by, the, fact, that, orbital, angular, momentum, is, proportional, to, the, radius, of, the, orbit, since, the, mass, does, not, change, and, the, angular, momentum, is, conserved, the, velocity, drops, tidal, acceleration, is, an, effect, of, the, tidal, forces, between, an, orbiting, natural, satellite, e, g, the, moon, and, the, primary, planet, that, it, orbits, e, g, earth, the, gravitational, torque, between, the, moon, and, the, tidal, bulge, of, earth, causes, the, moon, to, be, constantly, promoted, to, a, slightly, higher, orbit, 3, 8, cm, per, year, and, earth, to, be, decelerated, by, 25, 858, 0, 003, cy, in, its, rotation, the, length, of, the, day, increases, by, 1, 7, ms, per, century, 2, 3, ms, from, tidal, effect, and, 0, 6, ms, from, post, glacial, rebound, the, earth, loses, angular, momentum, which, is, transferred, to, the, moon, such, that, the, overall, angular, momentum, is, conserved, examples, of, using, conservation, of, angular, momentum, for, practical, advantage, are, abundant, in, engines, such, as, steam, engines, or, internal, combustion, engines, a, flywheel, is, needed, to, efficiently, convert, the, lateral, motion, of, the, pistons, to, rotational, motion, inertial, navigation, systems, explicitly, use, the, fact, that, angular, momentum, is, conserved, with, respect, to, the, inertial, frame, of, space, inertial, navigation, is, what, enables, submarine, trips, under, the, polar, ice, cap, but, are, also, crucial, to, all, forms, of, modern, navigation, rifled, bullets, use, the, stability, provided, by, conservation, of, angular, momentum, to, be, more, true, in, their, trajectory, the, invention, of, rifled, firearms, and, cannons, gave, their, users, significant, strategic, advantage, in, battle, and, thus, were, a, technological, turning, point, in, history, isaac, newton, in, the, principia, hinted, at, angular, momentum, in, his, examples, of, the, first, law, of, motion, a, top, whose, parts, by, their, cohesion, are, perpetually, drawn, aside, from, rectilinear, motions, does, not, cease, its, rotation, otherwise, than, as, it, is, retarded, by, the, air, the, greater, bodies, of, the, planets, and, comets, meeting, with, less, resistance, in, more, free, spaces, preserve, their, motions, both, progressive, and, circular, for, a, much, longer, time, he, did, not, further, investigate, angular, momentum, directly, in, the, principia, saying, from, such, kind, of, reflexions, also, sometimes, arise, the, circular, motions, of, bodies, about, their, own, centres, but, these, are, cases, which, i, do, not, consider, in, what, follows, and, it, would, be, too, tedious, to, demonstrate, every, particular, that, relates, to, this, subject, however, his, geometric, proof, of, the, law, of, areas, is, an, outstanding, example, of, newton, s, genius, and, indirectly, proves, angular, momentum, conservation, in, the, case, of, a, central, force, as, a, planet, orbits, the, sun, the, line, between, the, sun, and, the, planet, sweeps, out, equal, areas, in, equal, intervals, of, time, this, had, been, known, since, kepler, expounded, his, second, law, of, planetary, motion, newton, derived, a, unique, geometric, proof, and, went, on, to, show, that, the, attractive, force, of, the, sun, s, gravity, was, the, cause, of, all, of, kepler, s, laws, during, the, first, interval, of, time, an, object, is, in, motion, from, point, a, to, point, b, undisturbed, it, would, continue, to, point, c, during, the, second, interval, when, the, object, arrives, at, b, it, receives, an, impulse, directed, toward, point, s, the, impulse, gives, it, a, small, added, velocity, toward, s, such, that, if, this, were, its, only, velocity, it, would, move, from, b, to, v, during, the, second, interval, by, the, rules, of, velocity, composition, these, two, velocities, add, and, point, c, is, found, by, construction, of, parallelogram, bccv, thus, the, object, s, path, is, deflected, by, the, impulse, so, that, it, arrives, at, point, c, at, the, end, of, the, second, interval, because, the, triangles, sbc, and, sbc, have, the, same, base, sb, and, the, same, height, bc, or, vc, they, have, the, same, area, by, symmetry, triangle, sbc, also, has, the, same, area, as, triangle, sab, therefore, the, object, has, swept, out, equal, areas, sab, and, sbc, in, equal, times, at, point, c, the, object, receives, another, impulse, toward, s, again, deflecting, its, path, during, the, third, interval, from, d, to, d, thus, it, continues, to, e, and, beyond, the, triangles, sab, sbc, sbc, scd, scd, sde, sde, all, having, the, same, area, allowing, the, time, intervals, to, become, ever, smaller, the, path, abcde, approaches, indefinitely, close, to, a, continuous, curve, note, that, because, this, derivation, is, geometric, and, no, specific, force, is, applied, it, proves, a, more, general, law, than, kepler, s, second, law, of, planetary, motion, it, shows, that, the, law, of, areas, applies, to, any, central, force, attractive, or, repulsive, continuous, or, non, continuous, or, zero, the, proportionality, of, angular, momentum, to, the, area, swept, out, by, a, moving, object, can, be, understood, by, realizing, that, the, bases, of, the, triangles, that, is, the, lines, from, s, to, the, object, are, equivalent, to, the, radius, r, and, that, the, heights, of, the, triangles, are, proportional, to, the, perpendicular, component, of, velocity, v, hence, if, the, area, swept, per, unit, time, is, constant, then, by, the, triangular, area, formula, 1, 2, base, height, the, product, base, height, and, therefore, the, product, rv, are, constant, if, r, and, the, base, length, are, decreased, v, and, height, must, increase, proportionally, mass, is, constant, therefore, angular, momentum, rmv, is, conserved, by, this, exchange, of, distance, and, velocity, in, the, case, of, triangle, sbc, area, is, equal, to, 1, 2, sb, vc, wherever, c, is, eventually, located, due, to, the, impulse, applied, at, b, the, product, sb, vc, and, therefore, rmv, remain, constant, similarly, so, for, each, of, the, triangles, another, areal, proof, of, conservation, of, angular, momentum, for, any, central, force, uses, mamikon, s, sweeping, tangents, theorem, leonhard, euler, daniel, bernoulli, and, patrick, d, arcy, all, understood, angular, momentum, in, terms, of, conservation, of, areal, velocity, a, result, of, their, analysis, of, kepler, s, second, law, of, planetary, motion, it, is, unlikely, that, they, realized, the, implications, for, ordinary, rotating, matter, in, 1736, euler, like, newton, touched, on, some, of, the, equations, of, angular, momentum, in, his, mechanica, without, further, developing, them, bernoulli, wrote, in, a, 1744, letter, of, a, moment, of, rotational, motion, possibly, the, first, conception, of, angular, momentum, as, we, now, understand, it, in, 1799, pierre, simon, laplace, first, realized, that, a, fixed, plane, was, associated, with, rotation, his, invariable, plane, louis, poinsot, in, 1803, began, representing, rotations, as, a, line, segment, perpendicular, to, the, rotation, and, elaborated, on, the, conservation, of, moments, in, 1852, l, on, foucault, used, a, gyroscope, in, an, experiment, to, display, the, earth, s, rotation, william, j, m, rankine, s, 1858, manual, of, applied, mechanics, defined, angular, momentum, in, the, modern, sense, for, the, first, time, a, line, whose, length, is, proportional, to, the, magnitude, of, the, angular, momentum, and, whose, direction, is, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, motion, of, the, body, and, of, the, fixed, point, and, such, that, when, the, motion, of, the, body, is, viewed, from, the, extremity, of, the, line, the, radius, vector, of, the, body, seems, to, have, right, handed, rotation, in, an, 1872, edition, of, the, same, book, rankine, stated, that, the, term, angular, momentum, was, introduced, by, mr, hayward, probably, referring, to, r, b, hayward, s, article, on, a, direct, method, of, estimating, velocities, accelerations, and, all, similar, quantities, with, respect, to, axes, moveable, in, any, manner, in, space, with, applications, which, was, introduced, in, 1856, and, published, in, 1864, rankine, was, mistaken, as, numerous, publications, feature, the, term, starting, in, the, late, 18th, to, early, 19th, centuries, however, hayward, s, article, apparently, was, the, first, use, of, the, term, and, the, concept, seen, by, much, of, the, english, speaking, world, before, this, angular, momentum, was, typically, referred, to, as, momentum, of, rotation, in, english
