color, american, english, or, colour, british, and, commonwealth, english, is, the, visual, perception, based, on, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, though, color, is, not, an, inherent, property, of, matter, color, perception, is, related, to, an, object, s, light, absorption, reflection, emission, spectra, and, interference, for, most, humans, colors, are, perceived, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, with, three, types, of, cone, cells, trichromacy, other, animals, may, have, a, different, number, of, cone, cell, types, or, have, eyes, sensitive, to, different, wavelengths, such, as, bees, that, can, distinguish, ultraviolet, and, thus, have, a, different, color, sensitivity, range, animal, perception, of, color, originates, from, different, light, wavelength, or, spectral, sensitivity, in, cone, cell, types, which, is, then, processed, by, the, brain, colors, have, perceived, properties, such, as, hue, colorfulness, saturation, and, luminance, colors, can, also, be, additively, mixed, commonly, used, for, actual, light, or, subtractively, mixed, commonly, used, for, materials, if, the, colors, are, mixed, in, the, right, proportions, because, of, metamerism, they, may, look, the, same, as, a, single, wavelength, light, for, convenience, colors, can, be, organized, in, a, color, space, which, when, being, abstracted, as, a, mathematical, color, model, can, assign, each, region, of, color, with, a, corresponding, set, of, numbers, as, such, color, spaces, are, an, essential, tool, for, color, reproduction, in, print, photography, computer, monitors, and, television, the, most, well, known, color, models, are, rgb, cmyk, yuv, hsl, and, hsv, because, the, perception, of, color, is, an, important, aspect, of, human, life, different, colors, have, been, associated, with, emotions, activity, and, nationality, names, of, color, regions, in, different, cultures, can, have, different, sometimes, overlapping, areas, in, visual, arts, color, theory, is, used, to, govern, the, use, of, colors, in, an, aesthetically, pleasing, and, harmonious, way, the, theory, of, color, includes, the, color, complements, color, balance, and, classification, of, primary, colors, traditionally, red, yellow, blue, secondary, colors, traditionally, orange, green, purple, and, tertiary, colors, the, study, of, colors, in, general, is, called, color, science, electromagnetic, radiation, is, characterized, by, its, wavelength, or, frequency, and, its, intensity, when, the, wavelength, is, within, the, visible, spectrum, the, range, of, wavelengths, humans, can, perceive, approximately, from, 390, nm, to, 700, nm, it, is, known, as, visible, light, most, light, sources, emit, light, at, many, different, wavelengths, a, source, s, spectrum, is, a, distribution, giving, its, intensity, at, each, wavelength, although, the, spectrum, of, light, arriving, at, the, eye, from, a, given, direction, determines, the, color, sensation, in, that, direction, there, are, many, more, possible, spectral, combinations, than, color, sensations, in, fact, one, may, formally, define, a, color, as, a, class, of, spectra, that, give, rise, to, the, same, color, sensation, although, such, classes, would, vary, widely, among, different, species, and, to, a, lesser, extent, among, individuals, within, the, same, species, in, each, such, class, the, members, are, called, metamers, of, the, color, in, question, this, effect, can, be, visualized, by, comparing, the, light, sources, spectral, power, distributions, and, the, resulting, colors, the, familiar, colors, of, the, rainbow, in, the, spectrum, named, using, the, latin, word, for, appearance, or, apparition, by, isaac, newton, in, 1671, include, all, those, colors, that, can, be, produced, by, visible, light, of, a, single, wavelength, only, the, pure, spectral, or, monochromatic, colors, the, spectrum, above, shows, approximate, wavelengths, in, nm, for, spectral, colors, in, the, visible, range, spectral, colors, have, 100, purity, and, are, fully, saturated, a, complex, mixture, of, spectral, colors, can, be, used, to, describe, any, color, which, is, the, definition, of, a, light, power, spectrum, the, spectral, colors, form, a, continuous, spectrum, and, how, it, is, divided, into, distinct, colors, linguistically, is, a, matter, of, culture, and, historical, contingency, despite, the, ubiquitous, roygbiv, mnemonic, used, to, remember, the, spectral, colors, in, english, the, inclusion, or, exclusion, of, colors, is, contentious, with, disagreement, often, focused, on, indigo, and, cyan, even, if, the, subset, of, color, terms, is, agreed, their, wavelength, ranges, and, borders, between, them, may, not, be, the, intensity, of, a, spectral, color, relative, to, the, context, in, which, it, is, viewed, may, alter, its, perception, considerably, for, example, a, low, intensity, orange, yellow, is, brown, and, a, low, intensity, yellow, green, is, olive, green, additionally, hue, shifts, towards, yellow, or, blue, happen, if, the, intensity, of, a, spectral, light, is, increased, this, is, called, bezold, br, cke, shift, in, color, models, capable, of, representing, spectral, colors, such, as, cieluv, a, spectral, color, has, the, maximal, saturation, in, helmholtz, coordinates, this, is, described, as, 100, purity, the, physical, color, of, an, object, depends, on, how, it, absorbs, and, scatters, light, most, objects, scatter, light, to, some, degree, and, do, not, reflect, or, transmit, light, specularly, like, glasses, or, mirrors, a, transparent, object, allows, almost, all, light, to, transmit, or, pass, through, thus, transparent, objects, are, perceived, as, colorless, conversely, an, opaque, object, does, not, allow, light, to, transmit, through, and, instead, absorbing, or, reflecting, the, light, it, receives, like, transparent, objects, translucent, objects, allow, light, to, transmit, through, but, translucent, objects, are, seen, colored, because, they, scatter, or, absorb, certain, wavelengths, of, light, via, internal, scatterance, the, absorbed, light, is, often, dissipated, as, heat, although, aristotle, and, other, ancient, scientists, had, already, written, on, the, nature, of, light, and, color, vision, it, was, not, until, newton, that, light, was, identified, as, the, source, of, the, color, sensation, in, 1810, goethe, published, his, comprehensive, theory, of, colors, in, which, he, provided, a, rational, description, of, color, experience, which, tells, us, how, it, originates, not, what, it, is, schopenhauer, in, 1801, thomas, young, proposed, his, trichromatic, theory, based, on, the, observation, that, any, color, could, be, matched, with, a, combination, of, three, lights, this, theory, was, later, refined, by, james, clerk, maxwell, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, as, helmholtz, puts, it, the, principles, of, newton, s, law, of, mixture, were, experimentally, confirmed, by, maxwell, in, 1856, young, s, theory, of, color, sensations, like, so, much, else, that, this, marvelous, investigator, achieved, in, advance, of, his, time, remained, unnoticed, until, maxwell, directed, attention, to, it, at, the, same, time, as, helmholtz, ewald, hering, developed, the, opponent, process, theory, of, color, noting, that, color, blindness, and, afterimages, typically, come, in, opponent, pairs, red, green, blue, orange, yellow, violet, and, black, white, ultimately, these, two, theories, were, synthesized, in, 1957, by, hurvich, and, jameson, who, showed, that, retinal, processing, corresponds, to, the, trichromatic, theory, while, processing, at, the, level, of, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, corresponds, to, the, opponent, theory, in, 1931, an, international, group, of, experts, known, as, the, commission, internationale, de, l, clairage, cie, developed, a, mathematical, color, model, which, mapped, out, the, space, of, observable, colors, and, assigned, a, set, of, three, numbers, to, each, the, ability, of, the, human, eye, to, distinguish, colors, is, based, upon, the, varying, sensitivity, of, different, cells, in, the, retina, to, light, of, different, wavelengths, humans, are, trichromatic, the, retina, contains, three, types, of, color, receptor, cells, or, cones, one, type, relatively, distinct, from, the, other, two, is, most, responsive, to, light, that, is, perceived, as, blue, or, blue, violet, with, wavelengths, around, 450, nm, cones, of, this, type, are, sometimes, called, short, wavelength, cones, or, s, cones, or, misleadingly, blue, cones, the, other, two, types, are, closely, related, genetically, and, chemically, middle, wavelength, cones, m, cones, or, green, cones, are, most, sensitive, to, light, perceived, as, green, with, wavelengths, around, 540, nm, while, the, long, wavelength, cones, l, cones, or, red, cones, are, most, sensitive, to, light, that, is, perceived, as, greenish, yellow, with, wavelengths, around, 570, nm, light, no, matter, how, complex, its, composition, of, wavelengths, is, reduced, to, three, color, components, by, the, eye, each, cone, type, adheres, to, the, principle, of, univariance, which, is, that, each, cone, s, output, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, light, that, falls, on, it, over, all, wavelengths, for, each, location, in, the, visual, field, the, three, types, of, cones, yield, three, signals, based, on, the, extent, to, which, each, is, stimulated, these, amounts, of, stimulation, are, sometimes, called, tristimulus, values, the, response, curve, as, a, function, of, wavelength, varies, for, each, type, of, cone, because, the, curves, overlap, some, tristimulus, values, do, not, occur, for, any, incoming, light, combination, for, example, it, is, not, possible, to, stimulate, only, the, mid, wavelength, so, called, green, cones, the, other, cones, will, inevitably, be, stimulated, to, some, degree, at, the, same, time, the, set, of, all, possible, tristimulus, values, determines, the, human, color, space, it, has, been, estimated, that, humans, can, distinguish, roughly, 10, million, different, colors, the, other, type, of, light, sensitive, cell, in, the, eye, the, rod, has, a, different, response, curve, in, normal, situations, when, light, is, bright, enough, to, strongly, stimulate, the, cones, rods, play, virtually, no, role, in, vision, at, all, on, the, other, hand, in, dim, light, the, cones, are, understimulated, leaving, only, the, signal, from, the, rods, resulting, in, a, colorless, response, furthermore, the, rods, are, barely, sensitive, to, light, in, the, red, range, in, certain, conditions, of, intermediate, illumination, the, rod, response, and, a, weak, cone, response, can, together, result, in, color, discriminations, not, accounted, for, by, cone, responses, alone, these, effects, combined, are, summarized, also, in, the, kruithof, curve, which, describes, the, change, of, color, perception, and, pleasingness, of, light, as, a, function, of, temperature, and, intensity, while, the, mechanisms, of, color, vision, at, the, level, of, the, retina, are, well, described, in, terms, of, tristimulus, values, color, processing, after, that, point, is, organized, differently, a, dominant, theory, of, color, vision, proposes, that, color, information, is, transmitted, out, of, the, eye, by, three, opponent, processes, or, opponent, channels, each, constructed, from, the, raw, output, of, the, cones, a, red, green, channel, a, blue, yellow, channel, and, a, black, white, luminance, channel, this, theory, has, been, supported, by, neurobiology, and, accounts, for, the, structure, of, our, subjective, color, experience, specifically, it, explains, why, humans, cannot, perceive, a, reddish, green, or, yellowish, blue, and, it, predicts, the, color, wheel, it, is, the, collection, of, colors, for, which, at, least, one, of, the, two, color, channels, measures, a, value, at, one, of, its, extremes, the, exact, nature, of, color, perception, beyond, the, processing, already, described, and, indeed, the, status, of, color, as, a, feature, of, the, perceived, world, or, rather, as, a, feature, of, our, perception, of, the, world, a, type, of, qualia, is, a, matter, of, complex, and, continuing, philosophical, dispute, from, the, v1, blobs, color, information, is, sent, to, cells, in, the, second, visual, area, v2, the, cells, in, v2, that, are, most, strongly, color, tuned, are, clustered, in, the, thin, stripes, that, like, the, blobs, in, v1, stain, for, the, enzyme, cytochrome, oxidase, separating, the, thin, stripes, are, interstripes, and, thick, stripes, which, seem, to, be, concerned, with, other, visual, information, like, motion, and, high, resolution, form, neurons, in, v2, then, synapse, onto, cells, in, the, extended, v4, this, area, includes, not, only, v4, but, two, other, areas, in, the, posterior, inferior, temporal, cortex, anterior, to, area, v3, the, dorsal, posterior, inferior, temporal, cortex, and, posterior, teo, area, v4, was, initially, suggested, by, semir, zeki, to, be, exclusively, dedicated, to, color, and, he, later, showed, that, v4, can, be, subdivided, into, subregions, with, very, high, concentrations, of, color, cells, separated, from, each, other, by, zones, with, lower, concentration, of, such, cells, though, even, the, latter, cells, respond, better, to, some, wavelengths, than, to, others, a, finding, confirmed, by, subsequent, studies, the, presence, in, v4, of, orientation, selective, cells, led, to, the, view, that, v4, is, involved, in, processing, both, color, and, form, associated, with, color, but, it, is, worth, noting, that, the, orientation, selective, cells, within, v4, are, more, broadly, tuned, than, their, counterparts, in, v1, v2, and, v3, color, processing, in, the, extended, v4, occurs, in, millimeter, sized, color, modules, called, globs, this, is, the, part, of, the, brain, in, which, color, is, first, processed, into, the, full, range, of, hues, found, in, color, space, a, color, vision, deficiency, causes, an, individual, to, perceive, a, smaller, gamut, of, colors, than, the, standard, observer, with, normal, color, vision, the, effect, can, be, mild, having, lower, color, resolution, i, e, anomalous, trichromacy, moderate, lacking, an, entire, dimension, or, channel, of, color, e, g, dichromacy, or, complete, lacking, all, color, perception, i, e, monochromacy, most, forms, of, color, blindness, derive, from, one, or, more, of, the, three, classes, of, cone, cells, either, being, missing, having, a, shifted, spectral, sensitivity, or, having, lower, responsiveness, to, incoming, light, in, addition, cerebral, achromatopsia, is, caused, by, neural, anomalies, in, those, parts, of, the, brain, where, visual, processing, takes, place, some, colors, that, appear, distinct, to, an, individual, with, normal, color, vision, will, appear, metameric, to, the, color, blind, the, most, common, form, of, color, blindness, is, congenital, red, green, color, blindness, affecting, 8, of, males, individuals, with, the, strongest, form, of, this, condition, dichromacy, will, experience, blue, and, purple, green, and, yellow, teal, and, gray, as, colors, of, confusion, i, e, metamers, outside, of, humans, which, are, mostly, trichromatic, having, three, types, of, cones, most, mammals, are, dichromatic, possessing, only, two, cones, however, outside, of, mammals, most, vertebrates, are, tetrachromatic, having, four, types, of, cones, this, includes, most, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and, bony, fish, an, extra, dimension, of, color, vision, means, these, vertebrates, can, see, two, distinct, colors, that, a, normal, human, would, view, as, metamers, some, invertebrates, such, as, the, mantis, shrimp, have, an, even, higher, number, of, cones, 12, that, could, lead, to, a, richer, color, gamut, than, even, imaginable, by, humans, the, existence, of, human, tetrachromats, is, a, contentious, notion, as, many, as, half, of, all, human, females, have, 4, distinct, cone, classes, which, could, enable, tetrachromacy, however, a, distinction, must, be, made, between, retinal, or, weak, tetrachromats, which, express, four, cone, classes, in, the, retina, and, functional, or, strong, tetrachromats, which, are, able, to, make, the, enhanced, color, discriminations, expected, of, tetrachromats, in, fact, there, is, only, one, peer, reviewed, report, of, a, functional, tetrachromat, it, is, estimated, that, while, the, average, person, is, able, to, see, one, million, colors, someone, with, functional, tetrachromacy, could, see, a, hundred, million, colors, in, certain, forms, of, synesthesia, perceiving, letters, and, numbers, grapheme, color, synesthesia, or, hearing, sounds, chromesthesia, will, evoke, a, perception, of, color, behavioral, and, functional, neuroimaging, experiments, have, demonstrated, that, these, color, experiences, lead, to, changes, in, behavioral, tasks, and, lead, to, increased, activation, of, brain, regions, involved, in, color, perception, thus, demonstrating, their, reality, and, similarity, to, real, color, percepts, albeit, evoked, through, a, non, standard, route, synesthesia, can, occur, genetically, with, 4, of, the, population, having, variants, associated, with, the, condition, synesthesia, has, also, been, known, to, occur, with, brain, damage, drugs, and, sensory, deprivation, the, philosopher, pythagoras, experienced, synesthesia, and, provided, one, of, the, first, written, accounts, of, the, condition, in, approximately, 550, bce, he, created, mathematical, equations, for, musical, notes, that, could, form, part, of, a, scale, such, as, an, octave, after, exposure, to, strong, light, in, their, sensitivity, range, photoreceptors, of, a, given, type, become, desensitized, for, a, few, seconds, after, the, light, ceases, they, will, continue, to, signal, less, strongly, than, they, otherwise, would, colors, observed, during, that, period, will, appear, to, lack, the, color, component, detected, by, the, desensitized, photoreceptors, this, effect, is, responsible, for, the, phenomenon, of, afterimages, in, which, the, eye, may, continue, to, see, a, bright, figure, after, looking, away, from, it, but, in, a, complementary, color, afterimage, effects, have, also, been, used, by, artists, including, vincent, van, gogh, when, an, artist, uses, a, limited, color, palette, the, human, visual, system, tends, to, compensate, by, seeing, any, gray, or, neutral, color, as, the, color, which, is, missing, from, the, color, wheel, for, example, in, a, limited, palette, consisting, of, red, yellow, black, and, white, a, mixture, of, yellow, and, black, will, appear, as, a, variety, of, green, a, mixture, of, red, and, black, will, appear, as, a, variety, of, purple, and, pure, gray, will, appear, bluish, the, trichromatic, theory, is, strictly, true, when, the, visual, system, is, in, a, fixed, state, of, adaptation, in, reality, the, visual, system, is, constantly, adapting, to, changes, in, the, environment, and, compares, the, various, colors, in, a, scene, to, reduce, the, effects, of, the, illumination, if, a, scene, is, illuminated, with, one, light, and, then, with, another, as, long, as, the, difference, between, the, light, sources, stays, within, a, reasonable, range, the, colors, in, the, scene, appear, relatively, constant, to, us, this, was, studied, by, edwin, h, land, in, the, 1970s, and, led, to, his, retinex, theory, of, color, constancy, both, phenomena, are, readily, explained, and, mathematically, modeled, with, modern, theories, of, chromatic, adaptation, and, color, appearance, e, g, ciecam02, icam, there, is, no, need, to, dismiss, the, trichromatic, theory, of, vision, but, rather, it, can, be, enhanced, with, an, understanding, of, how, the, visual, system, adapts, to, changes, in, the, viewing, environment, color, reproduction, is, the, science, of, creating, colors, for, the, human, eye, that, faithfully, represent, the, desired, color, it, focuses, on, how, to, construct, a, spectrum, of, wavelengths, that, will, best, evoke, a, certain, color, in, an, observer, most, colors, are, not, spectral, colors, meaning, they, are, mixtures, of, various, wavelengths, of, light, however, these, non, spectral, colors, are, often, described, by, their, dominant, wavelength, which, identifies, the, single, wavelength, of, light, that, produces, a, sensation, most, similar, to, the, non, spectral, color, dominant, wavelength, is, roughly, akin, to, hue, there, are, many, color, perceptions, that, by, definition, cannot, be, pure, spectral, colors, due, to, desaturation, or, because, they, are, purples, mixtures, of, red, and, violet, light, from, opposite, ends, of, the, spectrum, some, examples, of, necessarily, non, spectral, colors, are, the, achromatic, colors, black, gray, and, white, and, colors, such, as, pink, tan, and, magenta, two, different, light, spectra, that, have, the, same, effect, on, the, three, color, receptors, in, the, human, eye, will, be, perceived, as, the, same, color, they, are, metamers, of, that, color, this, is, exemplified, by, the, white, light, emitted, by, fluorescent, lamps, which, typically, has, a, spectrum, of, a, few, narrow, bands, while, daylight, has, a, continuous, spectrum, the, human, eye, cannot, tell, the, difference, between, such, light, spectra, just, by, looking, into, the, light, source, although, the, color, rendering, index, of, each, light, source, may, affect, the, color, of, objects, illuminated, by, these, metameric, light, sources, similarly, most, human, color, perceptions, can, be, generated, by, a, mixture, of, three, colors, called, primaries, this, is, used, to, reproduce, color, scenes, in, photography, printing, television, and, other, media, there, are, a, number, of, methods, or, color, spaces, for, specifying, a, color, in, terms, of, three, particular, primary, colors, each, method, has, its, advantages, and, disadvantages, depending, on, the, particular, application, no, mixture, of, colors, however, can, produce, a, response, truly, identical, to, that, of, a, spectral, color, although, one, can, get, close, especially, for, the, longer, wavelengths, where, the, cie, 1931, color, space, chromaticity, diagram, has, a, nearly, straight, edge, for, example, mixing, green, light, 530, nm, and, blue, light, 460, nm, produces, cyan, light, that, is, slightly, desaturated, because, response, of, the, red, color, receptor, would, be, greater, to, the, green, and, blue, light, in, the, mixture, than, it, would, be, to, a, pure, cyan, light, at, 485, nm, that, has, the, same, intensity, as, the, mixture, of, blue, and, green, because, of, this, and, because, the, primaries, in, color, printing, systems, generally, are, not, pure, themselves, the, colors, reproduced, are, never, perfectly, saturated, spectral, colors, and, so, spectral, colors, cannot, be, matched, exactly, however, natural, scenes, rarely, contain, fully, saturated, colors, thus, such, scenes, can, usually, be, approximated, well, by, these, systems, the, range, of, colors, that, can, be, reproduced, with, a, given, color, reproduction, system, is, called, the, gamut, the, cie, chromaticity, diagram, can, be, used, to, describe, the, gamut, another, problem, with, color, reproduction, systems, is, connected, with, the, initial, measurement, of, color, or, colorimetry, the, characteristics, of, the, color, sensors, in, measurement, devices, e, g, cameras, scanners, are, often, very, far, from, the, characteristics, of, the, receptors, in, the, human, eye, a, color, reproduction, system, tuned, to, a, human, with, normal, color, vision, may, give, very, inaccurate, results, for, other, observers, according, to, color, vision, deviations, to, the, standard, observer, the, different, color, response, of, different, devices, can, be, problematic, if, not, properly, managed, for, color, information, stored, and, transferred, in, digital, form, color, management, techniques, such, as, those, based, on, icc, profiles, can, help, to, avoid, distortions, of, the, reproduced, colors, color, management, does, not, circumvent, the, gamut, limitations, of, particular, output, devices, but, can, assist, in, finding, good, mapping, of, input, colors, into, the, gamut, that, can, be, reproduced, additive, color, is, light, created, by, mixing, together, light, of, two, or, more, different, colors, red, green, and, blue, are, the, additive, primary, colors, normally, used, in, additive, color, systems, such, as, projectors, televisions, and, computer, terminals, subtractive, coloring, uses, dyes, inks, pigments, or, filters, to, absorb, some, wavelengths, of, light, and, not, others, the, color, that, a, surface, displays, comes, from, the, parts, of, the, visible, spectrum, that, are, not, absorbed, and, therefore, remain, visible, without, pigments, or, dye, fabric, fibers, paint, base, and, paper, are, usually, made, of, particles, that, scatter, white, light, all, colors, well, in, all, directions, when, a, pigment, or, ink, is, added, wavelengths, are, absorbed, or, subtracted, from, white, light, so, light, of, another, color, reaches, the, eye, if, the, light, is, not, a, pure, white, source, the, case, of, nearly, all, forms, of, artificial, lighting, the, resulting, spectrum, will, appear, a, slightly, different, color, red, paint, viewed, under, blue, light, may, appear, black, red, paint, is, red, because, it, scatters, only, the, red, components, of, the, spectrum, if, red, paint, is, illuminated, by, blue, light, it, will, be, absorbed, by, the, red, paint, creating, the, appearance, of, a, black, object, the, subtractive, model, also, predicts, the, color, resulting, from, a, mixture, of, paints, or, similar, medium, such, as, fabric, dye, whether, applied, in, layers, or, mixed, together, prior, to, application, in, the, case, of, paint, mixed, before, application, incident, light, interacts, with, many, different, pigment, particles, at, various, depths, inside, the, paint, layer, before, emerging, structural, colors, are, colors, caused, by, interference, effects, rather, than, by, pigments, color, effects, are, produced, when, a, material, is, scored, with, fine, parallel, lines, formed, of, one, or, more, parallel, thin, layers, or, otherwise, composed, of, microstructures, on, the, scale, of, the, color, s, wavelength, if, the, microstructures, are, spaced, randomly, light, of, shorter, wavelengths, will, be, scattered, preferentially, to, produce, tyndall, effect, colors, the, blue, of, the, sky, rayleigh, scattering, caused, by, structures, much, smaller, than, the, wavelength, of, light, in, this, case, air, molecules, the, luster, of, opals, and, the, blue, of, human, irises, if, the, microstructures, are, aligned, in, arrays, for, example, the, array, of, pits, in, a, cd, they, behave, as, a, diffraction, grating, the, grating, reflects, different, wavelengths, in, different, directions, due, to, interference, phenomena, separating, mixed, white, light, into, light, of, different, wavelengths, if, the, structure, is, one, or, more, thin, layers, then, it, will, reflect, some, wavelengths, and, transmit, others, depending, on, the, layers, thickness, structural, color, is, studied, in, the, field, of, thin, film, optics, the, most, ordered, or, the, most, changeable, structural, colors, are, iridescent, structural, color, is, responsible, for, the, blues, and, greens, of, the, feathers, of, many, birds, the, blue, jay, for, example, as, well, as, certain, butterfly, wings, and, beetle, shells, variations, in, the, pattern, s, spacing, often, give, rise, to, an, iridescent, effect, as, seen, in, peacock, feathers, soap, bubbles, films, of, oil, and, mother, of, pearl, because, the, reflected, color, depends, upon, the, viewing, angle, numerous, scientists, have, carried, out, research, in, butterfly, wings, and, beetle, shells, including, isaac, newton, and, robert, hooke, since, 1942, electron, micrography, has, been, used, advancing, the, development, of, products, that, exploit, structural, color, such, as, photonic, cosmetics, the, gamut, of, the, human, color, vision, is, bounded, by, optimal, colors, they, are, the, most, chromatic, colors, that, humans, are, able, to, see, the, emission, or, reflectance, spectrum, of, a, color, is, the, amount, of, light, of, each, wavelength, that, it, emits, or, reflects, in, proportion, to, a, given, maximum, which, has, the, value, of, 1, 100, if, the, emission, or, reflectance, spectrum, of, a, color, is, 0, 0, or, 1, 100, across, the, entire, visible, spectrum, and, it, has, no, more, than, two, transitions, between, 0, and, 1, or, 1, and, 0, then, it, is, an, optimal, color, with, the, current, state, of, technology, we, are, unable, to, produce, any, material, or, pigment, with, these, properties, thus, four, types, of, optimal, color, spectra, are, possible, in, the, first, the, transition, goes, from, 0, at, both, ends, of, the, spectrum, to, 1, in, the, middle, as, shown, in, the, image, at, right, in, the, second, it, goes, from, 1, at, the, ends, to, 0, in, the, middle, in, the, third, type, it, starts, at, 1, at, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, and, it, changes, to, 0, at, a, given, wavelength, in, the, fourth, type, it, starts, at, 0, in, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, and, it, changes, to, 1, at, a, given, wavelength, the, first, type, produces, colors, that, are, similar, to, the, spectral, colors, and, follow, roughly, the, horseshoe, shaped, portion, of, the, cie, xy, chromaticity, diagram, the, spectral, locus, but, are, generally, more, chromatic, although, less, spectrally, pure, the, second, type, produces, colors, that, are, similar, to, but, generally, more, chromatic, and, less, spectrally, pure, than, the, colors, on, the, straight, line, in, the, cie, xy, chromaticity, diagram, the, line, of, purples, leading, to, magenta, or, purple, like, colors, the, third, type, produces, the, colors, located, in, the, warm, sharp, edge, of, the, optimal, color, solid, this, will, be, explained, later, in, the, article, the, fourth, type, produces, the, colors, located, in, the, cold, sharp, edge, of, the, optimal, color, solid, the, optimal, color, solid, r, sch, macadam, color, solid, or, simply, visible, gamut, is, a, type, of, color, solid, that, contains, all, the, colors, that, humans, are, able, to, see, the, optimal, color, solid, is, bounded, by, the, set, of, all, optimal, colors, in, optimal, color, solids, the, colors, of, the, visible, spectrum, are, theoretically, black, because, their, emission, or, reflection, spectrum, is, 1, 100, in, only, one, wavelength, and, 0, in, all, of, the, other, infinite, visible, wavelengths, that, there, are, meaning, that, they, have, a, lightness, of, 0, with, respect, to, white, and, will, also, have, 0, chroma, but, of, course, 100, of, spectral, purity, in, short, in, optimal, color, solids, spectral, colors, are, equivalent, to, black, 0, lightness, 0, chroma, but, have, full, spectral, purity, they, are, located, in, the, horseshoe, shaped, spectral, locus, of, the, chromaticiy, diagram, in, linear, color, spaces, that, contain, all, colors, visible, by, humans, such, as, lms, or, cie, 1931, xyz, the, set, of, half, lines, that, start, at, the, origin, black, 0, 0, 0, and, pass, through, all, the, points, that, represent, the, colors, of, the, visible, spectrum, and, the, portion, of, a, plane, that, passes, through, the, violet, half, line, and, the, red, half, line, both, ends, of, the, visible, spectrum, generate, the, spectrum, cone, the, black, point, coordinates, 0, 0, 0, of, the, optimal, color, solid, and, only, the, black, point, is, tangent, to, the, spectrum, cone, and, the, white, point, 1, 1, 1, only, the, white, point, is, tangent, to, the, inverted, spectrum, cone, with, the, inverted, spectrum, cone, being, symmetrical, to, the, spectrum, cone, with, respect, to, the, middle, gray, point, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, this, means, that, in, linear, color, spaces, the, optimal, color, solid, is, centrally, symmetric, in, most, color, spaces, the, surface, of, the, optimal, color, solid, is, smooth, except, for, two, points, black, and, white, and, two, sharp, edges, the, warm, edge, which, goes, from, black, to, red, to, orange, to, yellow, to, white, and, the, cold, edge, which, goes, from, black, to, deep, violet, to, blue, to, cyan, to, white, this, is, due, to, the, following, if, the, portion, of, the, emission, or, reflection, spectrum, of, a, color, is, spectral, red, which, is, located, at, one, end, of, the, spectrum, it, will, be, seen, as, black, if, the, size, of, the, portion, of, total, emission, or, reflectance, is, increased, now, covering, from, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, to, the, yellow, wavelengths, it, will, be, seen, as, red, or, orange, if, the, portion, is, expanded, more, covering, the, green, wavelengths, it, will, be, seen, as, yellow, if, it, is, expanded, even, more, it, will, cover, more, wavelengths, than, the, yellow, semichrome, does, approaching, white, until, it, is, reached, when, the, full, spectrum, is, emitted, or, reflected, the, described, process, is, called, cumulation, cumulation, can, be, started, at, either, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, we, just, described, cumulation, starting, from, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, generating, the, warm, sharp, edge, cumulation, starting, at, the, violet, end, of, the, spectrum, will, generate, the, cold, sharp, edge, each, hue, has, a, maximum, chroma, color, also, known, as, maximum, chroma, point, semichrome, or, full, color, there, are, no, colors, of, that, hue, with, a, higher, chroma, they, are, the, most, chromatic, vibrant, optimal, colors, although, we, are, for, now, unable, to, produce, them, these, are, the, colors, that, would, be, located, in, an, ideal, color, wheel, they, were, called, semichromes, or, full, colors, by, the, german, chemist, and, philosopher, wilhelm, ostwald, in, the, early, 20th, century, if, b, is, the, complementary, wavelength, of, wavelength, a, then, the, straight, line, that, connects, a, and, b, passes, through, the, achromatic, axis, in, a, linear, color, space, such, as, lms, or, cie, 1931, xyz, if, the, emission, or, reflection, spectrum, of, a, color, is, 1, 100, for, all, the, wavelengths, between, a, and, b, and, 0, for, all, the, wavelengths, on, the, other, half, of, the, color, space, then, that, color, is, a, maximum, chroma, color, semichrome, or, full, color, this, is, the, explanation, to, why, they, were, called, semi, chromes, so, maximum, chroma, colors, are, a, type, of, optimal, colors, as, explained, full, colors, are, far, from, being, monochromatic, if, the, spectral, purity, of, a, maximum, chroma, color, is, increased, its, chroma, will, decrease, because, it, will, approach, the, visible, spectrum, ergo, it, will, approach, black, in, perceptually, uniform, color, spaces, the, lightness, of, the, full, colors, varies, from, around, 30, in, the, violetish, blue, hues, to, around, 90, in, the, yellowish, hues, the, chroma, of, each, maximum, chroma, point, also, varies, depending, on, the, hue, in, optimal, color, solids, plotted, in, perceptually, uniform, color, spaces, semichromes, like, red, green, blue, violet, and, magenta, have, a, high, chroma, while, semichromes, like, yellow, orange, and, cyan, have, a, slightly, lower, chroma, in, color, spaces, such, as, the, hsl, color, space, the, maximum, chroma, colors, are, located, around, the, equator, at, the, periphery, of, the, color, sphere, this, makes, color, solids, with, a, spherical, shape, inherently, non, perceptually, uniform, since, they, imply, that, all, full, colors, have, a, lightness, of, 50, when, as, humans, perceive, them, there, are, full, colors, with, a, lightness, from, around, 30, to, around, 90, a, perceptually, uniform, color, solid, has, an, irregular, shape, the, meanings, and, associations, of, colors, can, play, a, major, role, in, works, of, art, including, literature, individual, colors, have, a, variety, of, cultural, associations, such, as, national, colors, in, general, described, in, individual, color, articles, and, color, symbolism, the, field, of, color, psychology, attempts, to, identify, the, effects, of, color, on, human, emotion, and, activity, chromotherapy, is, a, form, of, alternative, medicine, attributed, to, various, eastern, traditions, colors, have, different, associations, in, different, countries, and, cultures, different, colors, have, been, demonstrated, to, have, effects, on, cognition, for, example, researchers, at, the, university, of, linz, in, austria, demonstrated, that, the, color, red, significantly, decreases, cognitive, functioning, in, men, the, combination, of, the, colors, red, and, yellow, together, can, induce, hunger, which, has, been, capitalized, on, by, a, number, of, chain, restaurants, color, plays, a, role, in, memory, development, too, a, photograph, that, is, in, black, and, white, is, slightly, less, memorable, than, one, in, color, studies, also, show, that, wearing, bright, colors, makes, you, more, memorable, to, people, you, meet, colors, vary, in, several, different, ways, including, hue, shades, of, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and, violet, etc, saturation, brightness, some, color, words, are, derived, from, the, name, of, an, object, of, that, color, such, as, orange, or, salmon, while, others, are, abstract, like, red, in, the, 1969, study, basic, color, terms, their, universality, and, evolution, brent, berlin, and, paul, kay, describe, a, pattern, in, naming, basic, colors, like, red, but, not, red, orange, or, dark, red, or, blood, red, which, are, shades, of, red, all, languages, that, have, two, basic, color, names, distinguish, dark, cool, colors, from, bright, warm, colors, the, next, colors, to, be, distinguished, are, usually, red, and, then, yellow, or, green, all, languages, with, six, basic, colors, include, black, white, red, green, blue, and, yellow, the, pattern, holds, up, to, a, set, of, twelve, black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and, azure, distinct, from, blue, in, russian, and, italian, but, not, english, some, colors, are, objectively, unusual, or, special, for, example, orpiment, was, a, pigment, used, by, painters, in, the, 16th, century, but, is, now, considered, dangerous, due, to, arsenic, sonoluminescence, is, a, blue, purple, created, by, the, energy, of, sound, waves, from, tiny, bubbles, in, extreme, experimental, conditions, and, was, discovered, in, 1934
