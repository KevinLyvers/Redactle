a, pulsar, from, pulsa, ting, r, adio, source, is, a, highly, magnetized, rotating, neutron, star, that, emits, beams, of, electromagnetic, radiation, out, of, its, magnetic, poles, this, radiation, can, be, observed, only, when, a, beam, of, emission, is, pointing, toward, earth, similar, to, the, way, a, lighthouse, can, be, seen, only, when, the, light, is, pointed, in, the, direction, of, an, observer, and, is, responsible, for, the, pulsed, appearance, of, emission, neutron, stars, are, very, dense, and, have, short, regular, rotational, periods, this, produces, a, very, precise, interval, between, pulses, that, ranges, from, milliseconds, to, seconds, for, an, individual, pulsar, pulsars, are, one, of, the, candidates, for, the, source, of, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, see, also, centrifugal, mechanism, of, acceleration, pulsars, highly, regular, pulses, make, them, very, useful, tools, for, astronomers, for, example, observations, of, a, pulsar, in, a, binary, neutron, star, system, were, used, to, indirectly, confirm, the, existence, of, gravitational, radiation, the, first, extrasolar, planets, were, discovered, in, 1992, around, a, pulsar, specifically, psr, b1257, 12, in, 1983, certain, types, of, pulsars, were, detected, that, at, that, time, exceeded, the, accuracy, of, atomic, clocks, in, keeping, time, signals, from, the, first, discovered, pulsar, were, initially, observed, by, jocelyn, bell, while, analyzing, data, recorded, on, august, 6, 1967, from, a, newly, commissioned, radio, telescope, that, she, helped, build, initially, dismissed, as, radio, interference, by, her, supervisor, and, developer, of, the, telescope, antony, hewish, the, fact, that, the, signals, always, appeared, at, the, same, declination, and, right, ascension, soon, ruled, out, a, terrestrial, source, on, november, 28, 1967, bell, and, hewish, using, a, fast, strip, chart, recorder, resolved, the, signals, as, a, series, of, pulses, evenly, spaced, every, 1, 337, seconds, no, astronomical, object, of, this, nature, had, ever, been, observed, before, on, december, 21, bell, discovered, a, second, pulsar, quashing, speculation, that, these, might, be, signals, beamed, at, earth, from, an, extraterrestrial, intelligence, when, observations, with, another, telescope, confirmed, the, emission, it, eliminated, any, sort, of, instrumental, effects, at, this, point, bell, said, of, herself, and, hewish, that, we, did, not, really, believe, that, we, had, picked, up, signals, from, another, civilization, but, obviously, the, idea, had, crossed, our, minds, and, we, had, no, proof, that, it, was, an, entirely, natural, radio, emission, it, is, an, interesting, problem, if, one, thinks, one, may, have, detected, life, elsewhere, in, the, universe, how, does, one, announce, the, results, responsibly, even, so, they, nicknamed, the, signal, lgm, 1, for, little, green, men, a, playful, name, for, intelligent, beings, of, extraterrestrial, origin, it, was, not, until, a, second, pulsating, source, was, discovered, in, a, different, part, of, the, sky, that, the, lgm, hypothesis, was, entirely, abandoned, their, pulsar, was, later, dubbed, cp, 1919, and, is, now, known, by, a, number, of, designators, including, psr, b1919, 21, and, psr, j1921, 2153, although, cp, 1919, emits, in, radio, wavelengths, pulsars, have, subsequently, been, found, to, emit, in, visible, light, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, wavelengths, the, word, pulsar, first, appeared, in, print, in, 1968, an, entirely, novel, kind, of, star, came, to, light, on, aug, 6, last, year, and, was, referred, to, by, astronomers, as, lgm, little, green, men, now, it, is, thought, to, be, a, novel, type, between, a, white, dwarf, and, a, neutron, the, name, pulsar, is, likely, to, be, given, to, it, dr, a, hewish, told, me, yesterday, i, am, sure, that, today, every, radio, telescope, is, looking, at, the, pulsars, the, existence, of, neutron, stars, was, first, proposed, by, walter, baade, and, fritz, zwicky, in, 1934, when, they, argued, that, a, small, dense, star, consisting, primarily, of, neutrons, would, result, from, a, supernova, based, on, the, idea, of, magnetic, flux, conservation, from, magnetic, main, sequence, stars, lodewijk, woltjer, proposed, in, 1964, that, such, neutron, stars, might, contain, magnetic, fields, as, large, as, 10, 14, to, 10, 16, gauss, 10, 10, to, 10, 12, tesla, in, 1967, shortly, before, the, discovery, of, pulsars, franco, pacini, suggested, that, a, rotating, neutron, star, with, a, magnetic, field, would, emit, radiation, and, even, noted, that, such, energy, could, be, pumped, into, a, supernova, remnant, around, a, neutron, star, such, as, the, crab, nebula, after, the, discovery, of, the, first, pulsar, thomas, gold, independently, suggested, a, rotating, neutron, star, model, similar, to, that, of, pacini, and, explicitly, argued, that, this, model, could, explain, the, pulsed, radiation, observed, by, bell, burnell, and, hewish, in, 1968, richard, v, e, lovelace, with, collaborators, discovered, period, p, 33, displaystyle, p, approx, 33, ms, of, the, crab, nebula, pulsar, using, arecibo, observatory, the, discovery, of, the, crab, pulsar, provided, confirmation, of, the, rotating, neutron, star, model, of, pulsars, the, crab, pulsar, 33, millisecond, pulse, period, was, too, short, to, be, consistent, with, other, proposed, models, for, pulsar, emission, moreover, the, crab, pulsar, is, so, named, because, it, is, located, at, the, center, of, the, crab, nebula, consistent, with, the, 1933, prediction, of, baade, and, zwicky, in, 1974, antony, hewish, and, martin, ryle, who, had, developed, revolutionary, radio, telescopes, became, the, first, astronomers, to, be, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, noting, that, hewish, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, discovery, of, pulsars, considerable, controversy, is, associated, with, the, fact, that, hewish, was, awarded, the, prize, while, bell, who, made, the, initial, discovery, while, she, was, his, phd, student, was, not, bell, claims, no, bitterness, upon, this, point, supporting, the, decision, of, the, nobel, prize, committee, in, 1974, joseph, hooton, taylor, jr, and, russell, hulse, discovered, for, the, first, time, a, pulsar, in, a, binary, system, psr, b1913, 16, this, pulsar, orbits, another, neutron, star, with, an, orbital, period, of, just, eight, hours, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, predicts, that, this, system, should, emit, strong, gravitational, radiation, causing, the, orbit, to, continually, contract, as, it, loses, orbital, energy, observations, of, the, pulsar, soon, confirmed, this, prediction, providing, the, first, ever, evidence, of, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, as, of, 2010, observations, of, this, pulsar, continues, to, agree, with, general, relativity, in, 1993, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, taylor, and, hulse, for, the, discovery, of, this, pulsar, in, 1982, don, backer, led, a, group, that, discovered, psr, b1937, 21, a, pulsar, with, a, rotation, period, of, just, 1, 6, milliseconds, 38, 500, rpm, observations, soon, revealed, that, its, magnetic, field, was, much, weaker, than, ordinary, pulsars, while, further, discoveries, cemented, the, idea, that, a, new, class, of, object, the, millisecond, pulsars, msps, had, been, found, msps, are, believed, to, be, the, end, product, of, x, ray, binaries, owing, to, their, extraordinarily, rapid, and, stable, rotation, msps, can, be, used, by, astronomers, as, clocks, rivaling, the, stability, of, the, best, atomic, clocks, on, earth, factors, affecting, the, arrival, time, of, pulses, at, earth, by, more, than, a, few, hundred, nanoseconds, can, be, easily, detected, and, used, to, make, precise, measurements, physical, parameters, accessible, through, pulsar, timing, include, the, 3d, position, of, the, pulsar, its, proper, motion, the, electron, content, of, the, interstellar, medium, along, the, propagation, path, the, orbital, parameters, of, any, binary, companion, the, pulsar, rotation, period, and, its, evolution, with, time, these, are, computed, from, the, raw, timing, data, by, tempo, a, computer, program, specialized, for, this, task, after, these, factors, have, been, taken, into, account, deviations, between, the, observed, arrival, times, and, predictions, made, using, these, parameters, can, be, found, and, attributed, to, one, of, three, possibilities, intrinsic, variations, in, the, spin, period, of, the, pulsar, errors, in, the, realization, of, terrestrial, time, against, which, arrival, times, were, measured, or, the, presence, of, background, gravitational, waves, scientists, are, currently, attempting, to, resolve, these, possibilities, by, comparing, the, deviations, seen, between, several, different, pulsars, forming, what, is, known, as, a, pulsar, timing, array, the, goal, of, these, efforts, is, to, develop, a, pulsar, based, time, standard, precise, enough, to, make, the, first, ever, direct, detection, of, gravitational, waves, in, 2006, a, team, of, astronomers, at, lanl, proposed, a, model, to, predict, the, likely, date, of, pulsar, glitches, with, observational, data, from, the, rossi, x, ray, timing, explorer, they, used, observations, of, the, pulsar, psr, j0537, 6910, that, is, known, to, be, a, quasi, periodic, glitching, pulsar, however, no, general, scheme, for, glitch, forecast, is, known, to, date, in, 1992, aleksander, wolszczan, discovered, the, first, extrasolar, planets, around, psr, b1257, 12, this, discovery, presented, important, evidence, concerning, the, widespread, existence, of, planets, outside, the, solar, system, although, it, is, very, unlikely, that, any, life, form, could, survive, in, the, environment, of, intense, radiation, near, a, pulsar, white, dwarfs, can, also, act, as, pulsars, because, the, moment, of, inertia, of, a, white, dwarf, is, much, higher, than, that, of, a, neutron, star, the, white, dwarf, pulsars, rotate, once, every, several, minutes, far, slower, than, neutron, star, pulsars, by, 2024, three, pulsar, like, white, dwarfs, have, been, identified, there, is, an, alternative, tentative, explanation, of, the, pulsar, like, properties, of, these, white, dwarfs, in, 2019, the, properties, of, pulsars, have, been, explained, using, a, numerical, magnetohydrodynamic, model, explaining, was, developed, at, cornell, university, according, to, this, model, ae, aqr, is, an, intermediate, polar, type, star, where, the, magnetic, field, is, relatively, weak, and, an, accretion, disc, may, form, around, the, white, dwarf, the, star, is, in, the, propeller, regime, and, many, of, its, observational, properties, are, determined, by, the, disc, magnetosphere, interaction, a, similar, model, for, erassu, j191213, 9, 441044, is, supported, by, the, results, of, its, observations, at, ultraviolet, wave, lengths, which, showed, that, its, magnetic, field, strength, does, not, exceed, 50, mg, initially, pulsars, were, named, with, letters, of, the, discovering, observatory, followed, by, their, right, ascension, e, g, cp, 1919, as, more, pulsars, were, discovered, the, letter, code, became, unwieldy, and, so, the, convention, then, arose, of, using, the, letters, psr, pulsating, source, of, radio, followed, by, the, pulsar, s, right, ascension, and, degrees, of, declination, e, g, psr, 0531, 21, and, sometimes, declination, to, a, tenth, of, a, degree, e, g, psr, 1913, 16, 7, pulsars, appearing, very, close, together, sometimes, have, letters, appended, e, g, psr, 0021, 72c, and, psr, 0021, 72d, the, modern, convention, prefixes, the, older, numbers, with, a, b, e, g, psr, b1919, 21, with, the, b, meaning, the, coordinates, are, for, the, 1950, 0, epoch, all, new, pulsars, have, a, j, indicating, 2000, 0, coordinates, and, also, have, declination, including, minutes, e, g, psr, j1921, 2153, pulsars, that, were, discovered, before, 1993, tend, to, retain, their, b, names, rather, than, use, their, j, names, e, g, psr, j1921, 2153, is, more, commonly, known, as, psr, b1919, 21, recently, discovered, pulsars, only, have, a, j, name, e, g, psr, j0437, 4715, all, pulsars, have, a, j, name, that, provides, more, precise, coordinates, of, its, location, in, the, sky, the, events, leading, to, the, formation, of, a, pulsar, begin, when, the, core, of, a, massive, star, is, compressed, during, a, supernova, which, collapses, into, a, neutron, star, the, neutron, star, retains, most, of, its, angular, momentum, and, since, it, has, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, its, progenitor, s, radius, and, therefore, its, moment, of, inertia, is, sharply, reduced, it, is, formed, with, very, high, rotation, speed, a, beam, of, radiation, is, emitted, along, the, magnetic, axis, of, the, pulsar, which, spins, along, with, the, rotation, of, the, neutron, star, the, magnetic, axis, of, the, pulsar, determines, the, direction, of, the, electromagnetic, beam, with, the, magnetic, axis, not, necessarily, being, the, same, as, its, rotational, axis, this, misalignment, causes, the, beam, to, be, seen, once, for, every, rotation, of, the, neutron, star, which, leads, to, the, pulsed, nature, of, its, appearance, in, rotation, powered, pulsars, the, beam, is, the, result, of, the, rotational, energy, of, the, neutron, star, which, generates, an, electrical, field, and, very, strong, magnetic, field, resulting, in, the, acceleration, of, protons, and, electrons, on, the, star, surface, and, the, creation, of, an, electromagnetic, beam, emanating, from, the, poles, of, the, magnetic, field, observations, by, nicer, of, psr, j0030, 0451, indicate, that, both, beams, originate, from, hotspots, located, on, the, south, pole, and, that, there, may, be, more, than, two, such, hotspots, on, that, star, this, rotation, slows, down, over, time, as, electromagnetic, power, is, emitted, when, a, pulsar, s, spin, period, slows, down, sufficiently, the, radio, pulsar, mechanism, is, believed, to, turn, off, the, so, called, death, line, this, turn, off, seems, to, take, place, after, about, 10, 100, million, years, which, means, of, all, the, neutron, stars, born, in, the, 13, 6, billion, year, age, of, the, universe, around, 99, no, longer, pulsate, though, the, general, picture, of, pulsars, as, rapidly, rotating, neutron, stars, is, widely, accepted, werner, becker, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, extraterrestrial, physics, said, in, 2006, the, theory, of, how, pulsars, emit, their, radiation, is, still, in, its, infancy, even, after, nearly, forty, years, of, work, three, distinct, classes, of, pulsars, are, currently, known, to, astronomers, according, to, the, source, of, the, power, of, the, electromagnetic, radiation, although, all, three, classes, of, objects, are, neutron, stars, their, observable, behavior, and, the, underlying, physics, are, quite, different, there, are, however, some, connections, for, example, x, ray, pulsars, are, probably, old, rotationally, powered, pulsars, that, have, already, lost, most, of, their, energy, and, have, only, become, visible, again, after, their, binary, companions, had, expanded, and, begun, transferring, matter, on, to, the, neutron, star, the, process, of, accretion, can, in, turn, transfer, enough, angular, momentum, to, the, neutron, star, to, recycle, it, as, a, rotation, powered, millisecond, pulsar, as, this, matter, lands, on, the, neutron, star, it, is, thought, to, bury, the, magnetic, field, of, the, neutron, star, although, the, details, are, unclear, leaving, millisecond, pulsars, with, magnetic, fields, 1000, 10, 000, times, weaker, than, average, pulsars, this, low, magnetic, field, is, less, effective, at, slowing, the, pulsar, s, rotation, so, millisecond, pulsars, live, for, billions, of, years, making, them, the, oldest, known, pulsars, millisecond, pulsars, are, seen, in, globular, clusters, which, stopped, forming, neutron, stars, billions, of, years, ago, of, interest, to, the, study, of, the, state, of, the, matter, in, a, neutron, star, are, the, glitches, observed, in, the, rotation, velocity, of, the, neutron, star, this, velocity, decreases, slowly, but, steadily, except, for, an, occasional, sudden, variation, a, glitch, one, model, put, forward, to, explain, these, glitches, is, that, they, are, the, result, of, starquakes, that, adjust, the, crust, of, the, neutron, star, models, where, the, glitch, is, due, to, a, decoupling, of, the, possibly, superconducting, interior, of, the, star, have, also, been, advanced, in, both, cases, the, star, s, moment, of, inertia, changes, but, its, angular, momentum, does, not, resulting, in, a, change, in, rotation, rate, when, two, massive, stars, are, born, close, together, from, the, same, cloud, of, gas, they, can, form, a, binary, system, and, orbit, each, other, from, birth, if, those, two, stars, are, at, least, a, few, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, their, lives, will, both, end, in, supernova, explosions, the, more, massive, star, explodes, first, leaving, behind, a, neutron, star, if, the, explosion, does, not, kick, the, second, star, away, the, binary, system, survives, the, neutron, star, can, now, be, visible, as, a, radio, pulsar, and, it, slowly, loses, energy, and, spins, down, later, the, second, star, can, swell, up, allowing, the, neutron, star, to, suck, up, its, matter, the, matter, falling, onto, the, neutron, star, spins, it, up, and, reduces, its, magnetic, field, this, is, called, recycling, because, it, returns, the, neutron, star, to, a, quickly, spinning, state, finally, the, second, star, also, explodes, in, a, supernova, producing, another, neutron, star, if, this, second, explosion, also, fails, to, disrupt, the, binary, a, double, neutron, star, binary, is, formed, otherwise, the, spun, up, neutron, star, is, left, with, no, companion, and, becomes, a, disrupted, recycled, pulsar, spinning, between, a, few, and, 50, times, per, second, the, discovery, of, pulsars, allowed, astronomers, to, study, an, object, never, observed, before, the, neutron, star, this, kind, of, object, is, the, only, place, where, the, behavior, of, matter, at, nuclear, density, can, be, observed, though, not, directly, also, millisecond, pulsars, have, allowed, a, test, of, general, relativity, in, conditions, of, an, intense, gravitational, field, pulsar, maps, have, been, included, on, the, two, pioneer, plaques, as, well, as, the, voyager, golden, record, they, show, the, position, of, the, sun, relative, to, 14, pulsars, which, are, identified, by, the, unique, timing, of, their, electromagnetic, pulses, so, that, earth, s, position, both, in, space, and, time, can, be, calculated, by, potential, extraterrestrial, intelligence, because, pulsars, are, emitting, very, regular, pulses, of, radio, waves, its, radio, transmissions, do, not, require, daily, corrections, moreover, pulsar, positioning, could, create, a, spacecraft, navigation, system, independently, or, be, used, in, conjunction, with, satellite, navigation, x, ray, pulsar, based, navigation, and, timing, xnav, or, simply, pulsar, navigation, is, a, navigation, technique, whereby, the, periodic, x, ray, signals, emitted, from, pulsars, are, used, to, determine, the, location, of, a, vehicle, such, as, a, spacecraft, in, deep, space, a, vehicle, using, xnav, would, compare, received, x, ray, signals, with, a, database, of, known, pulsar, frequencies, and, locations, similar, to, gps, this, comparison, would, allow, the, vehicle, to, calculate, its, position, accurately, 5, km, the, advantage, of, using, x, ray, signals, over, radio, waves, is, that, x, ray, telescopes, can, be, made, smaller, and, lighter, experimental, demonstrations, have, been, reported, in, 2018, generally, the, regularity, of, pulsar, emission, does, not, rival, the, stability, of, atomic, clocks, they, can, still, be, used, as, external, reference, for, example, j0437, 4715, has, a, period, of, 0, 005, 757, 451, 936, 712, 637, s, with, an, error, of, 1, 7, 10, 17, s, this, stability, allows, millisecond, pulsars, to, be, used, in, establishing, ephemeris, time, or, in, building, pulsar, clocks, timing, noise, is, the, name, for, rotational, irregularities, observed, in, all, pulsars, this, timing, noise, is, observable, as, random, wandering, in, the, pulse, frequency, or, phase, it, is, unknown, whether, timing, noise, is, related, to, pulsar, glitches, according, to, a, study, published, in, 2023, the, timing, noise, observed, in, pulsars, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, background, gravitational, waves, alternatively, it, may, be, caused, by, stochastic, fluctuations, in, both, the, internal, related, to, the, presence, of, superfluids, or, turbulence, and, external, due, to, magnetospheric, activity, torques, in, a, pulsar, the, radiation, from, pulsars, passes, through, the, interstellar, medium, ism, before, reaching, earth, free, electrons, in, the, warm, 8000, k, ionized, component, of, the, ism, and, h, ii, regions, affect, the, radiation, in, two, primary, ways, the, resulting, changes, to, the, pulsar, s, radiation, provide, an, important, probe, of, the, ism, itself, because, of, the, dispersive, nature, of, the, interstellar, plasma, lower, frequency, radio, waves, travel, through, the, medium, slower, than, higher, frequency, radio, waves, the, resulting, delay, in, the, arrival, of, pulses, at, a, range, of, frequencies, is, directly, measurable, as, the, dispersion, measure, of, the, pulsar, the, dispersion, measure, is, the, total, column, density, of, free, electrons, between, the, observer, and, the, pulsar, where, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, distance, from, the, pulsar, to, the, observer, and, n, e, displaystyle, n, e, is, the, electron, density, of, the, ism, the, dispersion, measure, is, used, to, construct, models, of, the, free, electron, distribution, in, the, milky, way, additionally, density, inhomogeneities, in, the, ism, cause, scattering, of, the, radio, waves, from, the, pulsar, the, resulting, scintillation, of, the, radio, waves, the, same, effect, as, the, twinkling, of, a, star, in, visible, light, due, to, density, variations, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, can, be, used, to, reconstruct, information, about, the, small, scale, variations, in, the, ism, due, to, the, high, velocity, up, to, several, hundred, km, s, of, many, pulsars, a, single, pulsar, scans, the, ism, rapidly, which, results, in, changing, scintillation, patterns, over, timescales, of, a, few, minutes, the, exact, cause, of, these, density, inhomogeneities, remains, an, open, question, with, possible, explanations, ranging, from, turbulence, to, current, sheets, pulsars, orbiting, within, the, curved, space, time, around, sgr, a, the, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, could, serve, as, probes, of, gravity, in, the, strong, field, regime, arrival, times, of, the, pulses, would, be, affected, by, special, and, general, relativistic, doppler, shifts, and, by, the, complicated, paths, that, the, radio, waves, would, travel, through, the, strongly, curved, space, time, around, the, black, hole, in, order, for, the, effects, of, general, relativity, to, be, measurable, with, current, instruments, pulsars, with, orbital, periods, less, than, about, 10, years, would, need, to, be, discovered, such, pulsars, would, orbit, at, distances, inside, 0, 01, pc, from, sgr, a, searches, are, currently, underway, at, present, five, pulsars, are, known, to, lie, within, 100, pc, from, sgr, a, there, are, four, consortia, around, the, world, which, use, pulsars, to, search, for, gravitational, waves, the, european, pulsar, timing, array, epta, in, europe, the, parkes, pulsar, timing, array, ppta, in, australia, the, north, american, nanohertz, observatory, for, gravitational, waves, nanograv, in, canada, and, the, us, and, the, indian, pulsar, timing, array, inpta, in, india, together, the, consortia, form, the, international, pulsar, timing, array, ipta, the, pulses, from, millisecond, pulsars, msps, are, used, as, a, system, of, galactic, clocks, disturbances, in, the, clocks, will, be, measurable, at, earth, a, disturbance, from, a, passing, gravitational, wave, will, have, a, particular, signature, across, the, ensemble, of, pulsars, and, will, be, thus, detected, the, pulsars, listed, here, were, either, the, first, discovered, of, its, type, or, represent, an, extreme, of, some, type, among, the, known, pulsar, population, such, as, having, the, shortest, measured, period
