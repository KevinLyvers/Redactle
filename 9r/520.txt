propane, p, r, o, p, e, n, is, a, three, carbon, alkane, with, the, molecular, formula, c, 3, h, 8, it, is, a, gas, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, but, compressible, to, a, transportable, liquid, a, by, product, of, natural, gas, processing, and, petroleum, refining, it, is, often, a, constituent, of, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, which, is, commonly, used, as, a, fuel, in, domestic, and, industrial, applications, and, in, low, emissions, public, transportation, other, constituents, of, lpg, may, include, propylene, butane, butylene, butadiene, and, isobutylene, discovered, in, 1857, by, the, french, chemist, marcellin, berthelot, it, became, commercially, available, in, the, us, by, 1911, propane, has, lower, volumetric, energy, density, than, gasoline, or, coal, but, has, higher, gravimetric, energy, density, than, them, and, burns, more, cleanly, propane, gas, has, become, a, popular, choice, for, barbecues, and, portable, stoves, because, its, low, 42, c, boiling, point, makes, it, vaporise, inside, pressurised, liquid, containers, it, exists, in, two, phases, vapor, above, liquid, it, retains, its, ability, to, vaporise, even, in, cold, weather, making, it, better, suited, for, outdoor, use, in, cold, climates, than, alternatives, with, higher, boiling, points, like, butane, lpg, powers, buses, forklifts, automobiles, outboard, boat, motors, and, ice, resurfacing, machines, and, is, used, for, heat, and, cooking, in, recreational, vehicles, and, campers, propane, is, becoming, popular, as, a, replacement, refrigerant, r290, for, heatpumps, also, as, it, offers, greater, efficiency, than, the, current, refrigerants, r410a, r32, higher, temperature, heat, output, and, less, damage, to, the, atmosphere, for, escaped, gasses, at, the, expense, of, high, gas, flammability, propane, was, first, synthesized, by, the, french, chemist, marcellin, berthelot, in, 1857, during, his, researches, on, hydrogenation, berthelot, made, propane, by, heating, propylene, dibromide, c, 3, h, 6, br, 2, with, potassium, iodide, and, water, p, 9, 1, 1, propane, was, found, dissolved, in, pennsylvanian, light, crude, oil, by, edmund, ronalds, in, 1864, walter, o, snelling, of, the, u, s, bureau, of, mines, highlighted, it, as, a, volatile, component, in, gasoline, in, 1910, which, marked, the, birth, of, the, propane, industry, in, the, united, states, the, volatility, of, these, lighter, hydrocarbons, caused, them, to, be, known, as, wild, because, of, the, high, vapor, pressures, of, unrefined, gasoline, on, march, 31, 1912, the, new, york, times, reported, on, snelling, s, work, with, liquefied, gas, saying, a, steel, bottle, will, carry, enough, gas, to, light, an, ordinary, home, for, three, weeks, it, was, during, this, time, that, snelling, in, cooperation, with, frank, p, peterson, chester, kerr, and, arthur, kerr, developed, ways, to, liquefy, the, lp, gases, during, the, refining, of, gasoline, together, they, established, american, gasol, co, the, first, commercial, marketer, of, propane, snelling, had, produced, relatively, pure, propane, by, 1911, and, on, march, 25, 1913, his, method, of, processing, and, producing, lp, gases, was, issued, patent, 1, 056, 845, a, separate, method, of, producing, lp, gas, through, compression, was, developed, by, frank, peterson, and, its, patent, was, granted, on, july, 2, 1912, the, 1920s, saw, increased, production, of, lp, gases, with, the, first, year, of, recorded, production, totaling, 223, 000, us, gallons, 840, m, 3, in, 1922, in, 1927, annual, marketed, lp, gas, production, reached, 1, million, us, gallons, 3, 800, m, 3, and, by, 1935, the, annual, sales, of, lp, gas, had, reached, 56, million, us, gallons, 210, 000, m, 3, major, industry, developments, in, the, 1930s, included, the, introduction, of, railroad, tank, car, transport, gas, odorization, and, the, construction, of, local, bottle, filling, plants, the, year, 1945, marked, the, first, year, that, annual, lp, gas, sales, reached, a, billion, gallons, by, 1947, 62, of, all, u, s, homes, had, been, equipped, with, either, natural, gas, or, propane, for, cooking, in, 1950, 1, 000, propane, fueled, buses, were, ordered, by, the, chicago, transit, authority, and, by, 1958, sales, in, the, u, s, had, reached, 7, billion, us, gallons, 26, 000, 000, m, 3, annually, in, 2004, it, was, reported, to, be, a, growing, 8, billion, to, 10, billion, industry, with, over, 15, billion, us, gallons, 57, 000, 000, m, 3, of, propane, being, used, annually, in, the, u, s, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, propane, shortages, were, reported, in, the, united, states, due, to, increased, demand, the, prop, root, found, in, propane, and, names, of, other, compounds, with, three, carbon, chains, was, derived, from, propionic, acid, which, in, turn, was, named, after, the, greek, words, protos, meaning, first, and, pion, fat, as, it, was, the, first, member, of, the, series, of, fatty, acids, propane, is, a, colorless, odorless, gas, ethyl, mercaptan, is, added, as, a, safety, precaution, as, an, odorant, and, is, commonly, called, a, rotten, egg, smell, at, normal, pressure, it, liquifies, below, its, boiling, point, at, 42, c, and, solidifies, below, its, melting, point, at, 187, 7, c, propane, crystallizes, in, the, space, group, p2, 1, n, the, low, space, filling, of, 58, 5, at, 90, k, due, to, the, bad, stacking, properties, of, the, molecule, is, the, reason, for, the, particularly, low, melting, point, propane, undergoes, combustion, reactions, in, a, similar, fashion, to, other, alkanes, in, the, presence, of, excess, oxygen, propane, burns, to, form, water, and, carbon, dioxide, c, 3, h, 8, 5, o, 2, 3, co, 2, 4, h, 2, o, heat, displaystyle, ce, c3h8, 5, o2, 3, co2, 4, h2o, heat, when, insufficient, oxygen, is, present, for, complete, combustion, carbon, monoxide, soot, carbon, or, both, are, formed, as, well, c, 3, h, 8, 9, 2, o, 2, 2, co, 2, co, 4, h, 2, o, heat, displaystyle, ce, c3h8, 9, 2, o2, 2, co2, co, 4, h2o, heat, c, 3, h, 8, 2, o, 2, 3, c, 4, h, 2, o, heat, displaystyle, ce, c3h8, 2, o2, 3, c, 4, h2o, heat, the, complete, combustion, of, propane, produces, about, 50, mj, kg, of, heat, propane, combustion, is, much, cleaner, than, that, of, coal, or, unleaded, gasoline, propane, s, per, btu, production, of, co, 2, is, almost, as, low, as, that, of, natural, gas, propane, burns, hotter, than, home, heating, oil, or, diesel, fuel, because, of, the, very, high, hydrogen, content, the, presence, of, c, c, bonds, plus, the, multiple, bonds, of, propylene, and, butylene, produce, organic, exhausts, besides, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, during, typical, combustion, these, bonds, also, cause, propane, to, burn, with, a, visible, flame, the, enthalpy, of, combustion, of, propane, gas, where, all, products, return, to, standard, state, for, example, where, water, returns, to, its, liquid, state, at, standard, temperature, known, as, higher, heating, value, is, 2, 219, 2, 0, 5, kj, mol, or, 50, 33, 0, 01, mj, kg, the, enthalpy, of, combustion, of, propane, gas, where, products, do, not, return, to, standard, state, for, example, where, the, hot, gases, including, water, vapor, exit, a, chimney, known, as, lower, heating, value, is, 2043, 455, kj, mol, the, lower, heat, value, is, the, amount, of, heat, available, from, burning, the, substance, where, the, combustion, products, are, vented, to, the, atmosphere, for, example, the, heat, from, a, fireplace, when, the, flue, is, open, the, density, of, propane, gas, at, 25, c, 77, f, is, 1, 808, kg, m, 3, about, 1, 5, the, density, of, air, at, the, same, temperature, the, density, of, liquid, propane, at, 25, c, 77, f, is, 0, 493, g, cm, 3, which, is, equivalent, to, 4, 11, pounds, per, u, s, liquid, gallon, or, 493, g, l, propane, expands, at, 1, 5, per, 10, f, thus, liquid, propane, has, a, density, of, approximately, 4, 2, pounds, per, gallon, 504, g, l, at, 60, f, 15, 6, c, as, the, density, of, propane, changes, with, temperature, this, fact, must, be, considered, every, time, when, the, application, is, connected, with, safety, or, custody, transfer, operations, propane, is, a, popular, choice, for, barbecues, and, portable, stoves, because, the, low, boiling, point, of, 42, c, 44, f, makes, it, vaporize, as, soon, as, it, is, released, from, its, pressurized, container, therefore, no, carburetor, or, other, vaporizing, device, is, required, a, simple, metering, nozzle, suffices, blends, of, pure, dry, isopropane, can, be, used, as, the, circulating, refrigerant, in, suitably, constructed, compressor, based, refrigeration, compared, to, fluorocarbons, propane, has, a, negligible, ozone, depletion, potential, and, very, low, global, warming, potential, having, a, gwp, value, of, 0, 072, 13, 9, times, lower, than, the, gwp, of, carbon, dioxide, and, can, serve, as, a, functional, replacement, for, r, 12, r, 22, r, 134a, and, other, chlorofluorocarbon, or, hydrofluorocarbon, refrigerants, in, conventional, stationary, refrigeration, and, air, conditioning, systems, because, its, global, warming, effect, is, far, less, than, current, refrigerants, propane, was, chosen, as, one, of, five, replacement, refrigerants, approved, by, the, epa, in, 2015, for, use, in, systems, specially, designed, to, handle, its, flammability, such, substitution, is, widely, prohibited, or, discouraged, in, motor, vehicle, air, conditioning, systems, on, the, grounds, that, using, flammable, hydrocarbons, in, systems, originally, designed, to, carry, non, flammable, refrigerant, presents, a, significant, risk, of, fire, or, explosion, vendors, and, advocates, of, hydrocarbon, refrigerants, argue, against, such, bans, on, the, grounds, that, there, have, been, very, few, such, incidents, relative, to, the, number, of, vehicle, air, conditioning, systems, filled, with, hydrocarbons, propane, is, also, instrumental, in, providing, off, the, grid, refrigeration, as, the, energy, source, for, a, gas, absorption, refrigerator, and, is, commonly, used, for, camping, and, recreational, vehicles, it, has, also, been, proposed, to, use, propane, as, a, refrigerant, in, heat, pumps, since, it, can, be, transported, easily, it, is, a, popular, fuel, for, home, heat, and, backup, electrical, generation, in, sparsely, populated, areas, that, do, not, have, natural, gas, pipelines, in, june, 2023, stanford, researchers, found, propane, combustion, emitted, detectable, and, repeatable, levels, of, benzene, that, in, some, homes, raised, indoor, benzene, concentrations, above, well, established, health, benchmarks, the, research, also, shows, that, gas, and, propane, fuels, appear, to, be, the, dominant, source, of, benzene, produced, by, cooking, in, rural, areas, of, north, america, as, well, as, northern, australia, propane, is, used, to, heat, livestock, facilities, in, grain, dryers, and, other, heat, producing, appliances, when, used, for, heating, or, grain, drying, it, is, usually, stored, in, a, large, permanently, placed, cylinder, which, is, refilled, by, a, propane, delivery, truck, as, of, 2014, 6, 2, million, american, households, use, propane, as, their, primary, heating, fuel, in, north, america, local, delivery, trucks, with, an, average, cylinder, size, of, 3, 000, us, gallons, 11, m, 3, fill, up, large, cylinders, that, are, permanently, installed, on, the, property, or, other, service, trucks, exchange, empty, cylinders, of, propane, with, filled, cylinders, large, tractor, trailer, trucks, with, an, average, cylinder, size, of, 10, 000, us, gallons, 38, m, 3, transport, propane, from, the, pipeline, or, refinery, to, the, local, bulk, plant, the, bobtail, tank, truck, is, not, unique, to, the, north, american, market, though, the, practice, is, not, as, common, elsewhere, and, the, vehicles, are, generally, called, tankers, in, many, countries, propane, is, delivered, to, end, users, via, small, or, medium, sized, individual, cylinders, while, empty, cylinders, are, removed, for, refilling, at, a, central, location, there, are, also, community, propane, systems, with, a, central, cylinder, feeding, individual, homes, in, the, u, s, over, 190, 000, on, road, vehicles, use, propane, and, over, 450, 000, forklifts, use, it, for, power, it, is, the, third, most, popular, vehicle, fuel, in, the, world, behind, gasoline, and, diesel, fuel, in, other, parts, of, the, world, propane, used, in, vehicles, is, known, as, autogas, in, 2007, approximately, 13, million, vehicles, worldwide, use, autogas, the, advantage, of, propane, in, cars, is, its, liquid, state, at, a, moderate, pressure, this, allows, fast, refill, times, affordable, fuel, cylinder, construction, and, price, ranges, typically, just, over, half, that, of, gasoline, meanwhile, it, is, noticeably, cleaner, both, in, handling, and, in, combustion, results, in, less, engine, wear, due, to, carbon, deposits, without, diluting, engine, oil, often, extending, oil, change, intervals, and, until, recently, was, relatively, low, cost, in, north, america, the, octane, rating, of, propane, is, relatively, high, at, 110, in, the, united, states, the, propane, fueling, infrastructure, is, the, most, developed, of, all, alternative, vehicle, fuels, many, converted, vehicles, have, provisions, for, topping, off, from, barbecue, bottles, purpose, built, vehicles, are, often, in, commercially, owned, fleets, and, have, private, fueling, facilities, a, further, saving, for, propane, fuel, vehicle, operators, especially, in, fleets, is, that, theft, is, much, more, difficult, than, with, gasoline, or, diesel, fuels, propane, is, also, used, as, fuel, for, small, engines, especially, those, used, indoors, or, in, areas, with, insufficient, fresh, air, and, ventilation, to, carry, away, the, more, toxic, exhaust, of, an, engine, running, on, gasoline, or, diesel, fuel, more, recently, there, have, been, lawn, care, products, like, string, trimmers, lawn, mowers, and, leaf, blowers, intended, for, outdoor, use, but, fueled, by, propane, in, order, to, reduce, air, pollution, many, heavy, duty, highway, trucks, use, propane, as, a, boost, where, it, is, added, through, the, turbocharger, to, mix, with, diesel, fuel, droplets, propane, droplets, very, high, hydrogen, content, helps, the, diesel, fuel, to, burn, hotter, and, therefore, more, completely, this, provides, more, torque, more, horsepower, and, a, cleaner, exhaust, for, the, trucks, it, is, normal, for, a, 7, liter, medium, duty, diesel, truck, engine, to, increase, fuel, economy, by, 20, to, 33, percent, when, a, propane, boost, system, is, used, it, is, cheaper, because, propane, is, much, cheaper, than, diesel, fuel, the, longer, distance, a, cross, country, trucker, can, travel, on, a, full, load, of, combined, diesel, and, propane, fuel, means, they, can, maintain, federal, hours, of, work, rules, with, two, fewer, fuel, stops, in, a, cross, country, trip, truckers, tractor, pulling, competitions, and, farmers, have, been, using, a, propane, boost, system, for, over, forty, years, in, north, america, the, north, american, standard, grade, of, automotive, use, propane, is, rated, hd, 5, heavy, duty, 5, hd, 5, grade, has, a, maximum, of, 5, percent, butane, but, propane, sold, in, europe, has, a, maximum, allowable, amount, of, butane, of, 30, percent, meaning, it, is, not, the, same, fuel, as, hd, 5, the, lpg, used, as, auto, fuel, and, cooking, gas, in, asia, and, australia, also, has, very, high, butane, content, propylene, also, called, propene, can, be, a, contaminant, of, commercial, propane, propane, containing, too, much, propene, is, not, suited, for, most, vehicle, fuels, hd, 5, is, a, specification, that, establishes, a, maximum, concentration, of, 5, propene, in, propane, propane, and, other, lp, gas, specifications, are, established, in, astm, d, 1835, all, propane, fuels, include, an, odorant, almost, always, ethanethiol, so, that, the, gas, can, be, smelled, easily, in, case, of, a, leak, propane, as, hd, 5, was, originally, intended, for, use, as, vehicle, fuel, hd, 5, is, currently, being, used, in, all, propane, applications, typically, in, the, united, states, and, canada, lpg, is, primarily, propane, at, least, 90, while, the, rest, is, mostly, ethane, propylene, butane, and, odorants, including, ethyl, mercaptan, this, is, the, hd, 5, standard, maximum, allowable, propylene, content, and, no, more, than, 5, butanes, and, ethane, defined, by, the, american, society, for, testing, and, materials, by, its, standard, 1835, for, internal, combustion, engines, not, all, products, labeled, lpg, conform, to, this, standard, however, in, mexico, for, example, gas, labeled, lpg, may, consist, of, 60, propane, and, 40, butane, the, exact, proportion, of, this, combination, varies, by, country, depending, on, international, prices, on, the, availability, of, components, and, especially, on, the, climatic, conditions, that, favor, lpg, with, higher, butane, content, in, warmer, regions, and, propane, in, cold, areas, propane, is, bought, and, stored, in, a, liquid, form, lpg, it, can, easily, be, stored, in, a, relatively, small, space, by, comparison, compressed, natural, gas, cng, cannot, be, liquefied, by, compression, at, normal, temperatures, as, these, are, well, above, its, critical, temperature, as, a, gas, very, high, pressure, is, required, to, store, useful, quantities, this, poses, the, hazard, that, in, an, accident, just, as, with, any, compressed, gas, cylinder, such, as, a, co, 2, cylinder, used, for, a, soda, concession, a, cng, cylinder, may, burst, with, great, force, or, leak, rapidly, enough, to, become, a, self, propelled, missile, therefore, cng, is, much, less, efficient, to, store, than, propane, due, to, the, large, cylinder, volume, required, an, alternative, means, of, storing, natural, gas, is, as, a, cryogenic, liquid, in, an, insulated, container, as, liquefied, natural, gas, lng, this, form, of, storage, is, at, low, pressure, and, is, around, 3, 5, times, as, efficient, as, storing, it, as, cng, unlike, propane, if, a, spill, occurs, cng, will, evaporate, and, dissipate, because, it, is, lighter, than, air, propane, is, much, more, commonly, used, to, fuel, vehicles, than, is, natural, gas, because, that, equipment, costs, less, propane, requires, just, 1, 220, kilopascals, 177, psi, of, pressure, to, keep, it, liquid, at, 37, 8, c, 100, f, propane, is, a, simple, asphyxiant, unlike, natural, gas, it, is, denser, than, air, it, may, accumulate, in, low, spaces, and, near, the, floor, when, abused, as, an, inhalant, it, may, cause, hypoxia, lack, of, oxygen, pneumonia, cardiac, failure, or, cardiac, arrest, propane, has, low, toxicity, since, it, is, not, readily, absorbed, and, is, not, biologically, active, commonly, stored, under, pressure, at, room, temperature, propane, and, its, mixtures, will, flash, evaporate, at, atmospheric, pressure, and, cool, well, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, the, cold, gas, which, appears, white, due, to, moisture, condensing, from, the, air, may, cause, frostbite, propane, is, denser, than, air, if, a, leak, in, a, propane, fuel, system, occurs, the, vaporized, gas, will, have, a, tendency, to, sink, into, any, enclosed, area, and, thus, poses, a, risk, of, explosion, and, fire, the, typical, scenario, is, a, leaking, cylinder, stored, in, a, basement, the, propane, leak, drifts, across, the, floor, to, the, pilot, light, on, the, furnace, or, water, heater, and, results, in, an, explosion, or, fire, this, property, makes, propane, generally, unsuitable, as, a, fuel, for, boats, in, 2007, a, heavily, investigated, vapor, related, explosion, occurred, in, ghent, west, virginia, u, s, killing, four, people, and, completely, destroying, the, little, general, convenience, store, on, flat, top, road, causing, several, injuries, another, hazard, associated, with, propane, storage, and, transport, is, known, as, a, bleve, or, boiling, liquid, expanding, vapor, explosion, the, kingman, explosion, involved, a, railroad, tank, car, in, kingman, arizona, u, s, in, 1973, during, a, propane, transfer, the, fire, and, subsequent, explosions, resulted, in, twelve, fatalities, and, numerous, injuries, propane, is, produced, as, a, by, product, of, two, other, processes, natural, gas, processing, and, petroleum, refining, the, processing, of, natural, gas, involves, removal, of, butane, propane, and, large, amounts, of, ethane, from, the, raw, gas, to, prevent, condensation, of, these, volatiles, in, natural, gas, pipelines, additionally, oil, refineries, produce, some, propane, as, a, by, product, of, cracking, petroleum, into, gasoline, or, heating, oil, the, supply, of, propane, cannot, easily, be, adjusted, to, meet, increased, demand, because, of, the, by, product, nature, of, propane, production, about, 90, of, u, s, propane, is, domestically, produced, the, united, states, imports, about, 10, of, the, propane, consumed, each, year, with, about, 70, of, that, coming, from, canada, via, pipeline, and, rail, the, remaining, 30, of, imported, propane, comes, to, the, united, states, from, other, sources, via, ocean, transport, after, it, is, separated, from, the, crude, oil, north, american, propane, is, stored, in, huge, salt, caverns, examples, of, these, are, fort, saskatchewan, alberta, mont, belvieu, texas, and, conway, kansas, these, salt, caverns, can, store, 80, 000, 000, barrels, 13, 000, 000, m, 3, of, propane, as, of, october, 2013, the, retail, cost, of, propane, was, approximately, 2, 37, per, gallon, or, roughly, 25, 95, per, 1, million, btus, this, means, that, filling, a, 500, gallon, propane, tank, which, is, what, households, that, use, propane, as, their, main, source, of, energy, usually, require, cost, 948, 80, of, 500, gallons, or, 400, gallons, a, 7, 5, increase, on, the, 2012, 2013, winter, season, average, us, price, however, propane, costs, per, gallon, change, significantly, from, one, state, to, another, the, energy, information, administration, eia, quotes, a, 2, 995, per, gallon, average, on, the, east, coast, for, october, 2013, while, the, figure, for, the, midwest, was, 1, 860, for, the, same, period, as, of, december, 2015, the, propane, retail, cost, was, approximately, 1, 97, per, gallon, this, means, that, filling, a, 500, gallon, propane, tank, to, 80, capacity, cost, 788, a, 16, 9, decrease, or, 160, less, from, the, november, 2013, quote, in, this, section, similar, regional, differences, in, prices, are, present, with, the, december, 2015, eia, figure, for, the, east, coast, at, 2, 67, per, gallon, and, the, midwest, at, 1, 43, per, gallon, as, of, august, 2018, the, average, us, propane, retail, cost, was, approximately, 2, 48, per, gallon, the, wholesale, price, of, propane, in, the, u, s, always, drops, in, the, summer, as, most, homes, do, not, require, it, for, home, heating, the, wholesale, price, of, propane, in, the, summer, of, 2018, was, between, 86, cents, to, 96, cents, per, u, s, gallon, based, on, a, truckload, or, railway, car, load, the, price, for, home, heating, was, exactly, double, that, price, at, 95, cents, per, gallon, wholesale, a, home, delivered, price, was, 1, 90, per, gallon, if, ordered, 500, gallons, at, a, time, prices, in, the, midwest, are, always, cheaper, than, california, prices, for, home, delivery, always, go, up, near, the, end, of, august, or, the, first, few, days, of, september, when, people, start, ordering, their, home, tanks, to, be, filled
