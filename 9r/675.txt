https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Devonian_extinction
the, late, devonian, extinction, consisted, of, several, extinction, events, in, the, late, devonian, epoch, which, collectively, represent, one, of, the, five, largest, mass, extinction, events, in, the, history, of, life, on, earth, the, term, primarily, refers, to, a, major, extinction, the, kellwasser, event, also, known, as, the, frasnian, famennian, extinction, which, occurred, around, 372, million, years, ago, at, the, boundary, between, the, frasnian, age, and, the, famennian, age, the, last, age, in, the, devonian, period, overall, 19, of, all, families, and, 50, of, all, genera, became, extinct, a, second, mass, extinction, called, the, hangenberg, event, also, known, as, the, end, devonian, extinction, occurred, 359, million, years, ago, bringing, an, end, to, the, famennian, and, devonian, as, the, world, transitioned, into, the, carboniferous, period, although, it, is, well, established, that, there, was, a, massive, loss, of, biodiversity, in, the, late, devonian, the, timespan, of, this, event, is, uncertain, with, estimates, ranging, from, 500, 000, to, 25, million, years, extending, from, the, mid, givetian, to, the, end, famennian, some, consider, the, extinction, to, be, as, many, as, seven, distinct, events, spread, over, about, 25, million, years, with, notable, extinctions, at, the, ends, of, the, givetian, frasnian, and, famennian, ages, by, the, late, devonian, the, land, had, been, colonized, by, plants, and, insects, in, the, oceans, massive, reefs, were, built, by, corals, and, stromatoporoids, euramerica, and, gondwana, were, beginning, to, converge, into, what, would, become, pangaea, the, extinction, seems, to, have, only, affected, marine, life, hard, hit, groups, include, brachiopods, trilobites, and, reef, building, organisms, the, latter, almost, completely, disappeared, the, causes, of, these, extinctions, are, unclear, leading, hypotheses, include, changes, in, sea, level, and, ocean, anoxia, possibly, triggered, by, global, cooling, or, oceanic, volcanism, the, impact, of, a, comet, or, another, extraterrestrial, body, has, also, been, suggested, such, as, the, siljan, ring, event, in, sweden, some, statistical, analysis, suggests, that, the, decrease, in, diversity, was, caused, more, by, a, decrease, in, speciation, than, by, an, increase, in, extinctions, this, might, have, been, caused, by, invasions, of, cosmopolitan, species, rather, than, by, any, single, event, placoderms, were, hit, hard, by, the, kellwasser, event, and, completely, died, out, in, the, hangenberg, event, but, most, other, jawed, vertebrates, were, less, strongly, impacted, agnathans, jawless, fish, were, in, decline, long, before, the, end, of, the, frasnian, and, were, nearly, wiped, out, by, the, extinctions, the, extinction, event, was, accompanied, by, widespread, oceanic, anoxia, that, is, a, lack, of, oxygen, prohibiting, decay, and, allowing, the, preservation, of, organic, matter, this, combined, with, the, ability, of, porous, reef, rocks, to, hold, oil, has, led, to, devonian, rocks, being, an, important, source, of, oil, especially, in, canada, and, the, united, states, during, the, late, devonian, the, continents, were, arranged, differently, from, today, with, a, supercontinent, gondwana, covering, much, of, the, southern, hemisphere, the, continent, of, siberia, occupied, the, northern, hemisphere, while, an, equatorial, continent, laurussia, formed, by, the, collision, of, baltica, and, laurentia, was, drifting, towards, gondwana, closing, the, rheic, ocean, the, caledonian, mountains, were, also, growing, across, what, is, now, the, scottish, highlands, and, scandinavia, while, the, appalachians, rose, over, america, the, biota, was, also, very, different, plants, which, had, been, on, land, in, forms, similar, to, mosses, and, liverworts, since, the, ordovician, had, just, developed, roots, seeds, and, water, transport, systems, that, allowed, them, to, survive, away, from, places, that, were, constantly, wet, and, so, grew, huge, forests, on, the, highlands, several, clades, had, developed, a, shrubby, or, tree, like, habit, by, the, late, givetian, including, the, cladoxylalean, ferns, lepidosigillarioid, lycopsids, and, aneurophyte, and, archaeopterid, progymnosperms, fish, were, also, undergoing, a, huge, radiation, and, tetrapodomorphs, such, as, the, frasnian, age, tiktaalik, were, beginning, to, evolve, leg, like, structures, the, kellwasser, event, and, most, other, later, devonian, pulses, primarily, affected, the, marine, community, and, had, a, greater, effect, on, shallow, warm, water, organisms, than, on, cool, water, organisms, the, kellwasser, event, s, effects, were, also, stronger, at, low, latitudes, than, high, ones, large, differences, are, observed, between, the, biotas, before, and, after, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, demonstrating, the, extinction, event, s, magnitude, the, most, hard, hit, biological, category, affected, by, the, kellwasser, event, were, the, calcite, based, reef, builders, of, the, great, devonian, reef, systems, including, the, stromatoporoid, sponges, and, the, rugose, and, tabulate, corals, it, left, communities, of, beloceratids, and, manticoceratids, devastated, following, the, kellwasser, event, reefs, of, the, famennian, were, primarily, dominated, by, siliceous, sponges, and, calcifying, bacteria, producing, structures, such, as, oncolites, and, stromatolites, although, there, is, evidence, this, shift, in, reef, composition, began, prior, to, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, the, collapse, of, the, reef, system, was, so, stark, that, it, would, take, until, the, mesozoic, for, reefs, to, recover, their, middle, devonian, extent, mesozoic, and, modern, reefs, are, based, on, scleractinian, stony, corals, which, would, not, evolve, until, the, triassic, period, devonian, reef, builders, are, entirely, extinct, in, the, modern, day, stromatoporoids, died, out, in, the, end, devonian, hangenberg, event, while, rugose, and, tabulate, corals, went, extinct, at, the, permian, triassic, extinction, further, taxa, to, be, starkly, affected, include, the, brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, conodonts, acritarch, and, graptolites, cystoids, disappeared, during, this, event, the, surviving, taxa, show, morphological, trends, through, the, event, atrypid, and, strophomenid, brachiopods, became, rarer, replaced, in, many, niches, by, productids, whose, spiny, shells, made, them, more, resistant, to, predation, and, environmental, disturbances, trilobites, evolved, smaller, eyes, in, the, run, up, to, the, kellwasser, event, with, eye, size, increasing, again, afterwards, this, suggests, vision, was, less, important, around, the, event, perhaps, due, to, increasing, water, depth, or, turbidity, the, brims, of, trilobites, i, e, the, rims, of, their, heads, also, expanded, across, this, period, the, brims, are, thought, to, have, served, a, respiratory, purpose, and, the, increasing, anoxia, of, waters, led, to, an, increase, in, their, brim, area, in, response, the, shape, of, conodonts, feeding, apparatus, varied, with, the, oxygen, isotope, ratio, and, thus, with, the, sea, water, temperature, this, may, relate, to, their, occupying, different, trophic, levels, as, nutrient, input, changed, as, with, most, extinction, events, specialist, taxa, occupying, small, niches, were, harder, hit, than, generalists, marine, invertebrates, that, lived, in, warmer, ecoregions, were, devastated, more, compared, to, those, living, in, colder, biomes, vertebrates, were, not, strongly, affected, by, the, kellwasser, event, but, still, experienced, some, diversity, loss, around, half, of, placoderm, families, died, out, primarily, species, poor, bottom, feeding, groups, more, diverse, placoderm, families, survived, the, event, only, to, succumb, in, the, hangenberg, event, at, the, end, of, the, devonian, most, lingering, agnathan, jawless, fish, groups, such, as, osteostracans, galeaspids, and, heterostracans, also, went, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, frasnian, the, jawless, thelodonts, only, barely, survived, succumbing, early, in, the, famennian, among, freshwater, and, shallow, marine, tetrapodomorph, fish, the, tetrapod, like, elpistostegalians, such, as, tiktaalik, disappeared, at, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, true, tetrapods, defined, as, four, limbed, vertebrates, with, digits, survived, and, experienced, an, evolutionary, radiation, following, the, kellwasser, extinction, though, their, fossils, are, rare, until, the, mid, to, late, famennian, the, late, devonian, crash, in, biodiversity, was, more, drastic, than, the, familiar, extinction, event, that, closed, the, cretaceous, a, recent, survey, mcghee, 1996, estimates, that, 22, of, all, the, families, of, marine, animals, largely, invertebrates, were, eliminated, the, family, is, a, great, unit, and, to, lose, so, many, signifies, a, deep, loss, of, ecosystem, diversity, on, a, smaller, scale, 57, of, genera, and, at, least, 75, of, species, did, not, survive, into, the, carboniferous, these, latter, estimates, need, to, be, treated, with, a, degree, of, caution, as, the, estimates, of, species, loss, depend, on, surveys, of, devonian, marine, taxa, that, are, perhaps, not, well, enough, known, to, assess, their, true, rate, of, losses, so, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, effects, of, differential, preservation, and, sampling, biases, during, the, devonian, extinction, rates, appear, to, have, been, higher, than, the, background, rate, for, an, extended, interval, covering, the, last, 20, 25, million, years, of, the, devonian, during, this, time, about, eight, to, ten, distinct, events, can, be, seen, of, which, two, the, kellwasser, and, the, hangenberg, events, stand, out, as, particularly, severe, the, kellwasser, event, was, preceded, by, a, longer, period, of, prolonged, biodiversity, loss, the, kellwasser, event, named, for, its, type, locality, the, kellwassertal, in, lower, saxony, germany, is, the, term, given, to, the, extinction, pulse, that, occurred, near, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, 372, 2, 1, 6, ma, most, references, to, the, late, devonian, extinction, are, in, fact, referring, to, the, kellwasser, which, was, the, first, event, to, be, detected, based, on, marine, invertebrate, record, and, was, the, most, severe, of, the, extinction, crises, of, the, late, devonian, there, may, in, fact, have, been, two, closely, spaced, events, here, as, shown, by, the, presence, of, two, distinct, anoxic, shale, layers, there, is, evidence, that, the, kellwasser, event, was, a, two, pulsed, event, with, the, two, extinction, pulses, being, separated, by, an, interval, of, approximately, 800, 000, years, the, second, pulse, was, more, severe, than, the, first, since, the, kellwasser, related, extinctions, occurred, over, such, a, long, time, it, is, difficult, to, assign, a, single, cause, and, indeed, to, separate, cause, from, effect, from, the, end, of, the, middle, devonian, 382, 7, 1, 6, ma, into, the, late, devonian, 382, 7, 1, 6, ma, to, 358, 9, 0, 4, ma, several, environmental, changes, can, be, detected, from, the, sedimentary, record, which, directly, affected, organisms, and, caused, extinction, what, caused, these, changes, is, somewhat, more, open, to, debate, possible, triggers, for, the, kellwasser, event, are, as, follows, during, the, late, silurian, and, devonian, land, plants, assisted, by, fungi, underwent, a, hugely, significant, phase, of, evolution, known, as, the, silurian, devonian, terrestrial, revolution, their, maximum, height, went, from, 30, cm, at, the, start, of, the, devonian, to, 30, m, archaeopterids, at, the, end, of, the, period, this, increase, in, height, was, made, possible, by, the, evolution, of, advanced, vascular, systems, which, permitted, the, growth, of, complex, branching, and, rooting, systems, facilitating, their, ability, to, colonise, drier, areas, previously, off, limits, to, them, in, conjunction, with, this, the, evolution, of, seeds, permitted, reproduction, and, dispersal, in, areas, which, were, not, waterlogged, allowing, plants, to, colonise, previously, inhospitable, inland, and, upland, areas, the, two, factors, combined, to, greatly, magnify, the, role, of, plants, on, the, global, scale, in, particular, archaeopteris, forests, expanded, rapidly, during, the, closing, ages, of, the, devonian, these, tall, trees, required, deep, rooting, systems, to, acquire, water, and, nutrients, and, provide, anchorage, these, systems, broke, up, the, upper, layers, of, bedrock, and, stabilized, a, deep, layer, of, soil, which, would, have, been, of, the, order, of, metres, thick, in, contrast, early, devonian, plants, bore, only, rhizoids, and, rhizomes, that, could, penetrate, no, more, than, a, few, centimeters, the, mobilization, of, a, large, portion, of, soil, had, a, huge, effect, soil, promotes, weathering, the, chemical, breakdown, of, rocks, releasing, ions, which, are, nutrients, for, plants, and, algae, the, relatively, sudden, input, of, nutrients, into, river, water, as, rooted, plants, expanded, into, upland, regions, may, have, caused, eutrophication, and, subsequent, anoxia, for, example, during, an, algal, bloom, organic, material, formed, at, the, surface, can, sink, at, such, a, rate, that, decomposition, of, dead, organisms, uses, up, all, available, oxygen, creating, anoxic, conditions, and, suffocating, bottom, dwelling, fish, the, fossil, reefs, of, the, frasnian, were, dominated, by, stromatoporoids, and, to, a, lesser, degree, corals, organisms, which, only, thrive, in, low, nutrient, conditions, therefore, the, postulated, influx, of, high, levels, of, nutrients, may, have, caused, an, extinction, anoxic, conditions, correlate, better, with, biotic, crises, than, phases, of, cooling, suggesting, anoxia, may, have, played, the, dominant, role, in, extinction, evidence, exists, of, a, rapid, increase, in, the, rate, of, organic, carbon, burial, and, for, widespread, anoxia, in, oceanic, bottom, waters, signs, of, anoxia, in, shallow, waters, have, also, been, described, from, a, variety, of, localities, good, evidence, has, been, found, for, high, frequency, sea, level, changes, around, the, frasnian, famennian, kellwasser, event, with, one, sea, level, rise, associated, with, the, onset, of, anoxic, deposits, marine, transgressions, likely, helped, spread, deoxygenated, waters, evidence, exists, for, the, modulation, of, the, intensity, of, anoxia, by, milankovitch, cycles, as, well, negative, 238, u, excursions, concomitant, with, both, the, lower, and, upper, kellwasser, events, provide, direct, evidence, for, an, increase, in, anoxia, photic, zone, euxinia, documented, by, concurrent, negative, 199, hg, and, positive, 202, hg, excursions, occurred, in, the, north, american, devonian, seaway, elevated, molybdenum, concentrations, further, support, widespread, euxinic, waters, the, timing, magnitude, and, causes, of, kellwasser, anoxia, remain, poorly, understood, anoxia, was, not, omnipresent, across, the, globe, in, some, regions, such, as, south, china, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, instead, shows, evidence, of, increased, oxygenation, of, the, seafloor, trace, metal, proxies, in, black, shales, from, new, york, state, point, to, anoxic, conditions, only, occurring, intermittently, being, interrupted, by, oxic, intervals, further, indicating, that, anoxia, was, not, globally, synchronous, a, finding, also, supported, by, the, prevalence, of, cyanobacterial, mats, in, the, holy, cross, mountains, in, the, time, period, around, the, kellwasser, event, evidence, from, various, european, sections, reveals, that, kellwasser, anoxia, was, relegated, to, epicontinental, seas, and, developed, as, a, result, of, upwelling, of, poorly, oxygenated, waters, within, ocean, basins, into, shallow, waters, rather, than, a, global, oceanic, anoxic, event, that, intruded, into, epicontinental, seas, a, positive, 18, o, excursion, is, observed, across, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, in, brachiopods, from, north, america, germany, spain, morocco, siberia, and, china, conodont, apatite, 18, o, excursions, also, occurred, at, this, time, a, similar, positive, 18, o, excursion, in, phosphates, is, known, from, the, boundary, corresponding, to, a, removal, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, and, a, global, cooling, event, this, oxygen, isotope, excursion, is, known, from, time, equivalent, strata, in, south, china, and, in, the, western, palaeotethys, suggesting, it, was, a, globally, synchronous, climatic, change, the, concomitance, of, the, drop, in, global, temperatures, and, the, swift, decline, of, metazoan, reefs, indicates, the, blameworthiness, of, global, cooling, in, precipitating, the, extinction, event, the, greening, of, the, continents, during, the, silurian, devonian, terrestrial, revolution, that, led, to, them, being, covered, with, massive, photosynthesizing, land, plants, in, the, first, forests, reduced, co, 2, levels, in, the, atmosphere, since, co, 2, is, a, greenhouse, gas, reduced, levels, might, have, helped, produce, a, chillier, climate, in, contrast, to, the, warm, climate, of, the, middle, devonian, the, biological, sequestration, of, carbon, dioxide, may, have, ultimately, led, to, the, beginning, of, the, late, palaeozoic, ice, age, during, the, famennian, which, has, been, suggested, as, a, cause, of, the, hangenberg, event, the, weathering, of, silicate, rocks, also, draws, down, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, and, co, 2, sequestration, by, mountain, building, has, been, suggested, as, a, cause, of, the, decline, in, greenhouse, gases, during, the, frasnian, famennian, transition, this, mountain, building, may, have, also, enhanced, biological, sequestration, through, an, increase, in, nutrient, runoff, the, combination, of, silicate, weathering, and, the, burial, of, organic, matter, to, decreased, atmospheric, co, 2, concentrations, from, about, 15, to, three, times, present, levels, carbon, in, the, form, of, plant, matter, would, be, produced, on, prodigious, scales, and, given, the, right, conditions, could, be, stored, and, buried, eventually, producing, vast, coal, measures, e, g, in, china, which, locked, the, carbon, out, of, the, atmosphere, and, into, the, lithosphere, this, reduction, in, atmospheric, co, 2, would, have, caused, global, cooling, and, resulted, in, at, least, one, period, of, late, devonian, glaciation, and, subsequent, sea, level, fall, probably, fluctuating, in, intensity, alongside, the, 40ka, milankovic, cycle, the, continued, drawdown, of, organic, carbon, eventually, pulled, the, earth, out, of, its, greenhouse, state, during, the, famennian, into, the, icehouse, that, continued, throughout, the, carboniferous, and, permian, magmatism, was, suggested, as, a, cause, of, the, late, devonian, extinction, in, 2002, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, had, extremely, widespread, trap, magmatism, and, rifting, in, the, russian, and, siberian, platforms, which, were, situated, above, the, hot, mantle, plumes, and, suggested, as, a, cause, of, the, frasnian, famennian, and, end, devonian, extinctions, the, viluy, large, igneous, province, located, in, the, vilyuysk, region, on, the, siberian, craton, covers, most, of, the, present, day, north, eastern, margin, of, the, siberian, platform, the, triple, junction, rift, system, was, formed, during, the, devonian, period, the, viluy, rift, is, the, western, remaining, branch, of, the, system, and, two, other, branches, form, the, modern, margin, of, the, siberian, platform, volcanic, rocks, are, covered, with, post, late, devonian, early, carboniferous, sediments, volcanic, rocks, dyke, belts, and, sills, that, cover, more, than, 320, 000, km, 2, and, a, gigantic, amount, of, magmatic, material, more, than, 1, million, km, 3, formed, in, the, viluy, branch, the, viluy, and, pripyat, dnieper, donets, large, igneous, provinces, were, suggested, to, correlate, with, the, frasnian, famennian, extinction, with, the, kola, and, timan, pechora, magmatic, provinces, being, suggested, to, be, related, to, the, hangenberg, event, at, the, devonian, carboniferous, boundary, viluy, magmatism, may, have, injected, enough, co, 2, and, so, 2, into, the, atmosphere, to, have, generated, a, destabilised, greenhouse, and, ecosystem, causing, rapid, global, cooling, sea, level, falls, and, marine, anoxia, to, occur, during, kellwasser, black, shale, deposition, viluy, traps, activity, may, have, also, enabled, euxinia, by, fertilising, the, oceans, with, sulphate, increasing, rates, of, microbial, sulphate, reduction, recent, studies, have, confirmed, a, correlation, between, viluy, traps, in, the, vilyuysk, region, on, the, siberian, craton, and, the, kellwasser, extinction, by, 40, ar, 39, ar, dating, ages, show, that, the, two, volcanic, phase, hypotheses, are, well, supported, and, the, weighted, mean, ages, of, each, volcanic, phase, are, 376, 7, 3, 4, and, 364, 4, 3, 4, ma, or, 373, 4, 2, 1, and, 363, 2, 2, 0, ma, which, the, first, volcanic, phase, is, in, agreement, with, the, age, of, 372, 2, 3, 2, ma, proposed, for, the, kellwasser, event, however, the, second, volcanic, phase, is, slightly, older, than, hangenberg, event, which, is, dated, to, around, 358, 9, 1, 2, ma, coronene, and, mercury, enrichment, has, been, found, in, deposits, dating, back, to, the, kellwasser, event, with, similar, enrichments, found, in, deposits, coeval, with, the, frasnes, event, at, the, givetian, frasnian, boundary, and, in, ones, coeval, with, the, hangenberg, event, because, coronene, enrichment, is, only, known, in, association, with, large, igneous, province, emissions, and, extraterrestrial, impacts, and, the, fact, that, there, is, no, confirmed, evidence, of, the, latter, occurring, in, association, with, the, kellwasser, event, this, enrichment, strongly, suggests, a, causal, relationship, between, volcanism, and, the, kellwasser, extinction, event, however, not, all, sites, show, evidence, of, mercury, enrichment, across, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, leading, other, studies, to, reject, volcanism, as, an, explanation, for, the, crisis, another, overlooked, contributor, to, the, kellwasser, mass, extinction, could, be, the, now, extinct, cerberean, caldera, which, was, active, in, the, late, devonian, period, and, thought, to, have, undergone, a, supereruption, approximately, 374, million, years, ago, remains, of, this, caldera, can, be, found, in, the, modern, day, state, of, victoria, australia, eovariscan, volcanic, activity, in, present, day, europe, may, have, also, played, a, role, in, conjunction, with, the, viluy, traps, bolide, impacts, can, be, dramatic, triggers, of, mass, extinctions, an, asteroid, impact, was, proposed, as, the, prime, cause, of, this, faunal, turnover, the, impact, that, created, the, siljan, ring, either, was, just, before, the, kellwasser, event, or, coincided, with, it, most, impact, craters, such, as, the, kellwasser, aged, alamo, cannot, generally, be, dated, with, sufficient, precision, to, link, them, to, the, event, others, dated, precisely, are, not, contemporaneous, with, the, extinction, although, some, evidence, of, meteoric, impact, have, been, observed, in, places, including, iridium, anomalies, and, microspherules, these, were, probably, caused, by, other, factors, some, lines, of, evidence, suggest, that, the, meteorite, impact, and, its, associated, geochemical, signals, postdate, the, extinction, event, modelling, studies, have, ruled, out, a, single, impact, as, entirely, inconsistent, with, available, evidence, although, a, multiple, impact, scenario, may, still, be, viable, near, earth, supernovae, have, been, speculated, as, possible, drivers, of, mass, extinctions, due, to, their, ability, to, cause, ozone, depletion, a, recent, explanation, suggests, that, a, nearby, supernova, explosion, was, the, cause, for, the, specific, hangenberg, event, which, marks, the, boundary, between, the, devonian, and, carboniferous, periods, this, could, offer, a, possible, explanation, for, the, dramatic, drop, in, atmospheric, ozone, during, the, hangenberg, event, that, could, have, permitted, massive, ultraviolet, damage, to, the, genetic, material, of, lifeforms, triggering, a, mass, extinction, recent, research, offers, evidence, of, ultraviolet, damage, to, pollen, and, spores, over, many, thousands, of, years, during, this, event, as, observed, in, the, fossil, record, and, that, in, turn, points, to, a, possible, long, term, destruction, of, the, ozone, layer, a, supernova, explosion, is, an, alternative, explanation, to, global, temperature, rise, that, could, account, for, the, drop, in, atmospheric, ozone, because, very, high, mass, stars, required, to, produce, a, supernova, tend, to, form, in, dense, star, forming, regions, of, space, and, have, short, lifespans, lasting, only, at, most, tens, of, millions, of, years, it, is, likely, that, if, a, supernova, did, occur, multiple, others, also, did, within, a, few, million, years, of, it, thus, supernovae, have, also, been, speculated, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, kellwasser, event, as, well, as, the, entire, sequence, of, environmental, crises, covering, several, millions, of, years, towards, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, detecting, either, of, the, long, lived, extra, terrestrial, radioisotopes, 146, sm, or, 244, pu, in, one, or, more, end, devonian, extinction, strata, would, confirm, a, supernova, origin, however, there, is, currently, no, direct, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, other, mechanisms, put, forward, to, explain, the, extinctions, include, tectonic, driven, climate, change, sea, level, change, and, oceanic, overturning, these, have, all, been, discounted, because, they, are, unable, to, explain, the, duration, selectivity, and, periodicity, of, the, extinctions
