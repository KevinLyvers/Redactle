holmium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ho, and, atomic, number, 67, it, is, a, rare, earth, element, and, the, eleventh, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, it, is, a, relatively, soft, silvery, fairly, corrosion, resistant, and, malleable, metal, like, many, other, lanthanides, holmium, is, too, reactive, to, be, found, in, native, form, as, pure, holmium, slowly, forms, a, yellowish, oxide, coating, when, exposed, to, air, when, isolated, holmium, is, relatively, stable, in, dry, air, at, room, temperature, however, it, reacts, with, water, and, corrodes, readily, and, also, burns, in, air, when, heated, in, nature, holmium, occurs, together, with, the, other, rare, earth, metals, like, thulium, it, is, a, relatively, rare, lanthanide, making, up, 1, 4, parts, per, million, of, the, earth, s, crust, an, abundance, similar, to, tungsten, holmium, was, discovered, through, isolation, by, swedish, chemist, per, theodor, cleve, it, was, also, independently, discovered, by, jacques, louis, soret, and, marc, delafontaine, who, together, observed, it, spectroscopically, in, 1878, its, oxide, was, first, isolated, from, rare, earth, ores, by, cleve, in, 1878, the, element, s, name, comes, from, holmia, the, latin, name, for, the, city, of, stockholm, like, many, other, lanthanides, holmium, is, found, in, the, minerals, monazite, and, gadolinite, and, is, usually, commercially, extracted, from, monazite, using, ion, exchange, techniques, its, compounds, in, nature, and, in, nearly, all, of, its, laboratory, chemistry, are, trivalently, oxidized, containing, ho, iii, ions, trivalent, holmium, ions, have, fluorescent, properties, similar, to, many, other, rare, earth, ions, while, yielding, their, own, set, of, unique, emission, light, lines, and, thus, are, used, in, the, same, way, as, some, other, rare, earths, in, certain, laser, and, glass, colorant, applications, holmium, has, the, highest, magnetic, permeability, and, magnetic, saturation, of, any, element, and, is, thus, used, for, the, pole, pieces, of, the, strongest, static, magnets, because, holmium, strongly, absorbs, neutrons, it, is, also, used, as, a, burnable, poison, in, nuclear, reactors, holmium, is, the, eleventh, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, in, the, periodic, table, it, appears, in, period, 6, between, the, lanthanides, dysprosium, to, its, left, and, erbium, to, its, right, and, above, the, actinide, einsteinium, with, a, boiling, point, of, 3, 000, k, 2, 730, c, holmium, is, the, sixth, most, volatile, lanthanide, after, ytterbium, europium, samarium, thulium, and, dysprosium, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, holmium, like, many, of, the, second, half, of, the, lanthanides, normally, assumes, a, hexagonally, close, packed, hcp, structure, its, 67, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4f, 11, 6s, 2, so, that, it, has, thirteen, valence, electrons, filling, the, 4f, and, 6s, subshells, holmium, like, all, of, the, lanthanides, is, paramagnetic, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, however, holmium, is, ferromagnetic, at, temperatures, below, 19, k, 254, 2, c, 425, 5, f, it, has, the, highest, magnetic, moment, 10, 6, b, of, any, naturally, occurring, element, and, possesses, other, unusual, magnetic, properties, when, combined, with, yttrium, it, forms, highly, magnetic, compounds, holmium, metal, tarnishes, slowly, in, air, forming, a, yellowish, oxide, layer, that, has, an, appearance, similar, to, that, of, iron, rust, it, burns, readily, to, form, holmium, iii, oxide, it, is, a, relatively, soft, and, malleable, element, that, is, fairly, corrosion, resistant, and, chemically, stable, in, dry, air, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, in, moist, air, and, at, higher, temperatures, however, it, quickly, oxidizes, forming, a, yellowish, oxide, in, pure, form, holmium, possesses, a, metallic, bright, silvery, luster, holmium, is, quite, electropositive, on, the, pauling, electronegativity, scale, it, has, an, electronegativity, of, 1, 23, it, is, generally, trivalent, it, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, holmium, iii, hydroxide, holmium, metal, reacts, with, all, the, stable, halogens, holmium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, yellow, ho, iii, ions, which, exist, as, a, 3, complexes, as, with, many, lanthanides, holmium, is, usually, found, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, forming, compounds, such, as, holmium, iii, fluoride, hof, 3, and, holmium, iii, chloride, hocl, 3, holmium, in, solution, is, in, the, form, of, ho, 3, surrounded, by, nine, molecules, of, water, holmium, dissolves, in, acids, however, holmium, is, also, found, to, exist, in, 2, 1, and, 0, oxidation, states, the, isotopes, of, holmium, range, from, 140, ho, to, 175, ho, the, primary, decay, mode, before, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 165, ho, is, positron, emission, and, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, minus, decay, the, primary, decay, products, before, 165, ho, are, terbium, and, dysprosium, isotopes, and, the, primary, products, after, are, erbium, isotopes, natural, holmium, consists, of, one, primordial, isotope, holmium, 165, it, is, the, only, isotope, of, holmium, that, is, thought, to, be, stable, although, it, is, predicted, to, undergo, alpha, decay, to, terbium, 161, with, a, very, long, half, life, of, the, 35, synthetic, radioactive, isotopes, that, are, known, the, most, stable, one, is, holmium, 163, 163, ho, with, a, half, life, of, 4570, years, all, other, radioisotopes, have, ground, state, half, lives, not, greater, than, 1, 117, days, with, the, longest, holmium, 166, 166, ho, having, a, half, life, of, 26, 83, hours, and, most, have, half, lives, under, 3, hours, 166m1, ho, has, a, half, life, of, around, 1200, years, the, high, excitation, energy, resulting, in, a, particularly, rich, spectrum, of, decay, gamma, rays, produced, when, the, metastable, state, de, excites, makes, this, isotope, useful, as, a, means, for, calibrating, gamma, ray, spectrometers, holmium, iii, oxide, is, the, only, oxide, of, holmium, it, changes, its, color, depending, on, the, lighting, conditions, in, daylight, it, has, a, yellowish, color, under, trichromatic, light, it, appears, orange, red, almost, indistinguishable, from, the, appearance, of, erbium, oxide, under, the, same, lighting, conditions, the, color, change, is, related, to, the, sharp, emission, lines, of, trivalent, holmium, ions, acting, as, red, phosphors, holmium, iii, oxide, appears, pink, under, a, cold, cathode, fluorescent, lamp, other, chalcogenides, are, known, for, holmium, holmium, iii, sulfide, has, orange, yellow, crystals, in, the, monoclinic, crystal, system, with, the, space, group, p, 2, 1, m, no, 11, under, high, pressure, holmium, iii, sulfide, can, form, in, the, cubic, and, orthorhombic, crystal, systems, it, can, be, obtained, by, the, reaction, of, holmium, iii, oxide, and, hydrogen, sulfide, at, 1, 598, k, 1, 325, c, 2, 417, f, holmium, iii, selenide, is, also, known, it, is, antiferromagnetic, below, 6, k, all, four, trihalides, of, holmium, are, known, holmium, iii, fluoride, is, a, yellowish, powder, that, can, be, produced, by, reacting, holmium, iii, oxide, and, ammonium, fluoride, then, crystallising, it, from, the, ammonium, salt, formed, in, solution, holmium, iii, chloride, can, be, prepared, in, a, similar, way, with, ammonium, chloride, instead, of, ammonium, fluoride, it, has, the, ycl, 3, layer, structure, in, the, solid, state, these, compounds, as, well, as, holmium, iii, bromide, and, holmium, iii, iodide, can, be, obtained, by, the, direct, reaction, of, the, elements, in, addition, holmium, iii, iodide, can, be, obtained, by, the, direct, reaction, of, holmium, and, mercury, ii, iodide, then, removing, the, mercury, by, distillation, organoholmium, compounds, are, very, similar, to, those, of, the, other, lanthanides, as, they, all, share, an, inability, to, undergo, backbonding, they, are, thus, mostly, restricted, to, the, mostly, ionic, cyclopentadienides, isostructural, with, those, of, lanthanum, and, the, bonded, simple, alkyls, and, aryls, some, of, which, may, be, polymeric, holmium, holmia, latin, name, for, stockholm, was, discovered, by, the, swiss, chemists, jacques, louis, soret, and, marc, delafontaine, in, 1878, who, noticed, the, aberrant, spectrographic, emission, spectrum, of, the, then, unknown, element, they, called, it, element, x, the, swedish, chemist, per, teodor, cleve, also, independently, discovered, the, element, while, he, was, working, on, erbia, earth, erbium, oxide, he, was, the, first, to, isolate, the, new, element, using, the, method, developed, by, the, swedish, chemist, carl, gustaf, mosander, cleve, first, removed, all, of, the, known, contaminants, from, erbia, the, result, of, that, effort, was, two, new, materials, one, brown, and, one, green, he, named, the, brown, substance, holmia, after, the, latin, name, for, cleve, s, home, town, stockholm, and, the, green, one, thulia, holmia, was, later, found, to, be, the, holmium, oxide, and, thulia, was, thulium, oxide, in, the, english, physicist, henry, moseley, s, classic, paper, on, atomic, numbers, holmium, was, assigned, the, value, 66, the, holmium, preparation, he, had, been, given, to, investigate, had, been, impure, dominated, by, neighboring, at, the, time, undiscovered, dysprosium, he, would, have, seen, x, ray, emission, lines, for, both, elements, but, assumed, that, the, dominant, ones, belonged, to, holmium, instead, of, the, dysprosium, impurity, like, all, the, other, rare, earth, elements, holmium, is, not, naturally, found, as, a, free, element, it, occurs, combined, with, other, elements, in, gadolinite, monazite, and, other, rare, earth, minerals, no, holmium, dominant, mineral, has, yet, been, found, the, main, mining, areas, are, china, united, states, brazil, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, with, reserves, of, holmium, estimated, as, 400, 000, tonnes, the, annual, production, of, holmium, metal, is, of, about, 10, tonnes, per, year, holmium, makes, up, 1, 3, parts, per, million, of, the, earth, s, crust, by, mass, holmium, makes, up, 1, part, per, million, of, the, soils, 400, parts, per, quadrillion, of, seawater, and, almost, none, of, earth, s, atmosphere, which, is, very, rare, for, a, lanthanide, it, makes, up, 500, parts, per, trillion, of, the, universe, by, mass, holmium, is, commercially, extracted, by, ion, exchange, from, monazite, sand, 0, 05, holmium, but, is, still, difficult, to, separate, from, other, rare, earths, the, element, has, been, isolated, through, the, reduction, of, its, anhydrous, chloride, or, fluoride, with, metallic, calcium, its, estimated, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, 1, 3, mg, kg, holmium, obeys, the, oddo, harkins, rule, as, an, odd, numbered, element, it, is, less, abundant, than, both, dysprosium, and, erbium, however, it, is, the, most, abundant, of, the, odd, numbered, heavy, lanthanides, of, the, lanthanides, only, promethium, thulium, lutetium, and, terbium, are, less, abundant, on, earth, the, principal, current, source, are, some, of, the, ion, adsorption, clays, of, southern, china, some, of, these, have, a, rare, earth, composition, similar, to, that, found, in, xenotime, or, gadolinite, yttrium, makes, up, about, two, thirds, of, the, total, by, mass, holmium, is, around, 1, 5, holmium, is, relatively, inexpensive, for, a, rare, earth, metal, with, the, price, about, 1000, usd, kg, glass, containing, holmium, oxide, and, holmium, oxide, solutions, usually, in, perchloric, acid, have, sharp, optical, absorption, peaks, in, the, spectral, range, 200, to, 900, nm, they, are, therefore, used, as, a, calibration, standard, for, optical, spectrophotometers, the, radioactive, but, long, lived, 166m1, ho, is, used, in, calibration, of, gamma, ray, spectrometers, holmium, is, used, to, create, the, strongest, artificially, generated, magnetic, fields, when, placed, within, high, strength, magnets, as, a, magnetic, pole, piece, also, called, a, magnetic, flux, concentrator, holmium, is, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, some, permanent, magnets, holmium, doped, yttrium, iron, garnet, yig, and, yttrium, lithium, fluoride, have, applications, in, solid, state, lasers, and, ho, yig, has, applications, in, optical, isolators, and, in, microwave, equipment, e, g, yig, spheres, holmium, lasers, emit, at, 2, 1, micrometres, they, are, used, in, medical, dental, and, fiber, optical, applications, it, is, also, being, considered, for, usage, in, the, enucleation, of, the, prostate, since, holmium, can, absorb, nuclear, fission, bred, neutrons, it, is, used, as, a, burnable, poison, to, regulate, nuclear, reactors, it, is, used, as, a, colorant, for, cubic, zirconia, providing, pink, coloring, and, for, glass, providing, yellow, orange, coloring, in, march, 2017, ibm, announced, that, they, had, developed, a, technique, to, store, one, bit, of, data, on, a, single, holmium, atom, set, on, a, bed, of, magnesium, oxide, with, sufficient, quantum, and, classical, control, techniques, holmium, may, be, a, good, candidate, to, make, quantum, computers, holmium, plays, no, biological, role, in, humans, but, its, salts, are, able, to, stimulate, metabolism, humans, typically, consume, about, a, milligram, of, holmium, a, year, plants, do, not, readily, take, up, holmium, from, the, soil, some, vegetables, have, had, their, holmium, content, measured, and, it, amounted, to, 100, parts,
