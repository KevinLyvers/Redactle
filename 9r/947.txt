in, physics, relativistic, mechanics, refers, to, mechanics, compatible, with, special, relativity, sr, and, general, relativity, gr, it, provides, a, non, quantum, mechanical, description, of, a, system, of, particles, or, of, a, fluid, in, cases, where, the, velocities, of, moving, objects, are, comparable, to, the, speed, of, light, c, as, a, result, classical, mechanics, is, extended, correctly, to, particles, traveling, at, high, velocities, and, energies, and, provides, a, consistent, inclusion, of, electromagnetism, with, the, mechanics, of, particles, this, was, not, possible, in, galilean, relativity, where, it, would, be, permitted, for, particles, and, light, to, travel, at, any, speed, including, faster, than, light, the, foundations, of, relativistic, mechanics, are, the, postulates, of, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, the, unification, of, sr, with, quantum, mechanics, is, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, while, attempts, for, that, of, gr, is, quantum, gravity, an, unsolved, problem, in, physics, as, with, classical, mechanics, the, subject, can, be, divided, into, kinematics, the, description, of, motion, by, specifying, positions, velocities, and, accelerations, and, dynamics, a, full, description, by, considering, energies, momenta, and, angular, momenta, and, their, conservation, laws, and, forces, acting, on, particles, or, exerted, by, particles, there, is, however, a, subtlety, what, appears, to, be, moving, and, what, is, at, rest, which, is, termed, by, statics, in, classical, mechanics, depends, on, the, relative, motion, of, observers, who, measure, in, frames, of, reference, although, some, definitions, and, concepts, from, classical, mechanics, do, carry, over, to, sr, such, as, force, as, the, time, derivative, of, momentum, newton, s, second, law, the, work, done, by, a, particle, as, the, line, integral, of, force, exerted, on, the, particle, along, a, path, and, power, as, the, time, derivative, of, work, done, there, are, a, number, of, significant, modifications, to, the, remaining, definitions, and, formulae, sr, states, that, motion, is, relative, and, the, laws, of, physics, are, the, same, for, all, experimenters, irrespective, of, their, inertial, reference, frames, in, addition, to, modifying, notions, of, space, and, time, sr, forces, one, to, reconsider, the, concepts, of, mass, momentum, and, energy, all, of, which, are, important, constructs, in, newtonian, mechanics, sr, shows, that, these, concepts, are, all, different, aspects, of, the, same, physical, quantity, in, much, the, same, way, that, it, shows, space, and, time, to, be, interrelated, consequently, another, modification, is, the, concept, of, the, center, of, mass, of, a, system, which, is, straightforward, to, define, in, classical, mechanics, but, much, less, obvious, in, relativity, see, relativistic, center, of, mass, for, details, the, equations, become, more, complicated, in, the, more, familiar, three, dimensional, vector, calculus, formalism, due, to, the, nonlinearity, in, the, lorentz, factor, which, accurately, accounts, for, relativistic, velocity, dependence, and, the, speed, limit, of, all, particles, and, fields, however, they, have, a, simpler, and, elegant, form, in, four, dimensional, spacetime, which, includes, flat, minkowski, space, sr, and, curved, spacetime, gr, because, three, dimensional, vectors, derived, from, space, and, scalars, derived, from, time, can, be, collected, into, four, vectors, or, four, dimensional, tensors, however, the, six, component, angular, momentum, tensor, is, sometimes, called, a, bivector, because, in, the, 3d, viewpoint, it, is, two, vectors, one, of, these, the, conventional, angular, momentum, being, an, axial, vector, the, relativistic, four, velocity, that, is, the, four, vector, representing, velocity, in, relativity, is, defined, as, follows, in, the, above, displaystyle, tau, is, the, proper, time, of, the, path, through, spacetime, called, the, world, line, followed, by, the, object, velocity, the, above, represents, and, is, the, four, position, the, coordinates, of, an, event, due, to, time, dilation, the, proper, time, is, the, time, between, two, events, in, a, frame, of, reference, where, they, take, place, at, the, same, location, the, proper, time, is, related, to, coordinate, time, t, by, where, v, displaystyle, gamma, mathbf, v, is, the, lorentz, factor, either, version, may, be, quoted, so, it, follows, the, first, three, terms, excepting, the, factor, of, v, displaystyle, gamma, mathbf, v, is, the, velocity, as, seen, by, the, observer, in, their, own, reference, frame, the, v, displaystyle, gamma, mathbf, v, is, determined, by, the, velocity, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, between, the, observer, s, reference, frame, and, the, object, s, frame, which, is, the, frame, in, which, its, proper, time, is, measured, this, quantity, is, invariant, under, lorentz, transformation, so, to, check, to, see, what, an, observer, in, a, different, reference, frame, sees, one, simply, multiplies, the, velocity, four, vector, by, the, lorentz, transformation, matrix, between, the, two, reference, frames, the, mass, of, an, object, as, measured, in, its, own, frame, of, reference, is, called, its, rest, mass, or, invariant, mass, and, is, sometimes, written, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, if, an, object, moves, with, velocity, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, in, some, other, reference, frame, the, quantity, m, v, m, 0, displaystyle, m, gamma, mathbf, v, m, 0, is, often, called, the, object, s, relativistic, mass, in, that, frame, some, authors, use, m, displaystyle, m, to, denote, rest, mass, but, for, the, sake, of, clarity, this, article, will, follow, the, convention, of, using, m, displaystyle, m, for, relativistic, mass, and, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, for, rest, mass, lev, okun, has, suggested, that, the, concept, of, relativistic, mass, has, no, rational, justification, today, and, should, no, longer, be, taught, other, physicists, including, wolfgang, rindler, and, t, r, sandin, contend, that, the, concept, is, useful, see, mass, in, special, relativity, for, more, information, on, this, debate, a, particle, whose, rest, mass, is, zero, is, called, massless, photons, and, gravitons, are, thought, to, be, massless, and, neutrinos, are, nearly, so, there, are, a, couple, of, equivalent, ways, to, define, momentum, and, energy, in, sr, one, method, uses, conservation, laws, if, these, laws, are, to, remain, valid, in, sr, they, must, be, true, in, every, possible, reference, frame, however, if, one, does, some, simple, thought, experiments, using, the, newtonian, definitions, of, momentum, and, energy, one, sees, that, these, quantities, are, not, conserved, in, sr, one, can, rescue, the, idea, of, conservation, by, making, some, small, modifications, to, the, definitions, to, account, for, relativistic, velocities, it, is, these, new, definitions, which, are, taken, as, the, correct, ones, for, momentum, and, energy, in, sr, the, four, momentum, of, an, object, is, straightforward, identical, in, form, to, the, classical, momentum, but, replacing, 3, vectors, with, 4, vectors, the, energy, and, momentum, of, an, object, with, invariant, mass, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, moving, with, velocity, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, with, respect, to, a, given, frame, of, reference, are, respectively, given, by, the, factor, displaystyle, gamma, comes, from, the, definition, of, the, four, velocity, described, above, the, appearance, of, displaystyle, gamma, may, be, stated, in, an, alternative, way, which, will, be, explained, in, the, next, section, the, kinetic, energy, k, displaystyle, k, is, defined, as, and, the, speed, as, a, function, of, kinetic, energy, is, given, by, the, spatial, momentum, may, be, written, as, p, m, v, displaystyle, mathbf, p, m, mathbf, v, preserving, the, form, from, newtonian, mechanics, with, relativistic, mass, substituted, for, newtonian, mass, however, this, substitution, fails, for, some, quantities, including, force, and, kinetic, energy, moreover, the, relativistic, mass, is, not, invariant, under, lorentz, transformations, while, the, rest, mass, is, for, this, reason, many, people, prefer, to, use, the, rest, mass, and, account, for, displaystyle, gamma, explicitly, through, the, 4, velocity, or, coordinate, time, a, simple, relation, between, energy, momentum, and, velocity, may, be, obtained, from, the, definitions, of, energy, and, momentum, by, multiplying, the, energy, by, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, multiplying, the, momentum, by, c, 2, displaystyle, c, 2, and, noting, that, the, two, expressions, are, equal, this, yields, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, may, then, be, eliminated, by, dividing, this, equation, by, c, displaystyle, c, and, squaring, dividing, the, definition, of, energy, by, displaystyle, gamma, and, squaring, and, substituting, this, is, the, relativistic, energy, momentum, relation, while, the, energy, e, displaystyle, e, and, the, momentum, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, depend, on, the, frame, of, reference, in, which, they, are, measured, the, quantity, e, 2, p, c, 2, displaystyle, e, 2, pc, 2, is, invariant, its, value, is, c, 2, displaystyle, c, 2, times, the, squared, magnitude, of, the, 4, momentum, vector, the, invariant, mass, of, a, system, may, be, written, as, due, to, kinetic, energy, and, binding, energy, this, quantity, is, different, from, the, sum, of, the, rest, masses, of, the, particles, of, which, the, system, is, composed, rest, mass, is, not, a, conserved, quantity, in, special, relativity, unlike, the, situation, in, newtonian, physics, however, even, if, an, object, is, changing, internally, so, long, as, it, does, not, exchange, energy, or, momentum, with, its, surroundings, its, rest, mass, will, not, change, and, can, be, calculated, with, the, same, result, in, any, reference, frame, the, relativistic, energy, momentum, equation, holds, for, all, particles, even, for, massless, particles, for, which, m, 0, 0, in, this, case, when, substituted, into, ev, c, 2, p, this, gives, v, c, massless, particles, such, as, photons, always, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, notice, that, the, rest, mass, of, a, composite, system, will, generally, be, slightly, different, from, the, sum, of, the, rest, masses, of, its, parts, since, in, its, rest, frame, their, kinetic, energy, will, increase, its, mass, and, their, negative, binding, energy, will, decrease, its, mass, in, particular, a, hypothetical, box, of, light, would, have, rest, mass, even, though, made, of, particles, which, do, not, since, their, momenta, would, cancel, looking, at, the, above, formula, for, invariant, mass, of, a, system, one, sees, that, when, a, single, massive, object, is, at, rest, v, 0, p, 0, there, is, a, non, zero, mass, remaining, m, 0, e, c, 2, the, corresponding, energy, which, is, also, the, total, energy, when, a, single, particle, is, at, rest, is, referred, to, as, rest, energy, in, systems, of, particles, which, are, seen, from, a, moving, inertial, frame, total, energy, increases, and, so, does, momentum, however, for, single, particles, the, rest, mass, remains, constant, and, for, systems, of, particles, the, invariant, mass, remain, constant, because, in, both, cases, the, energy, and, momentum, increases, subtract, from, each, other, and, cancel, thus, the, invariant, mass, of, systems, of, particles, is, a, calculated, constant, for, all, observers, as, is, the, rest, mass, of, single, particles, for, systems, of, particles, the, energy, momentum, equation, requires, summing, the, momentum, vectors, of, the, particles, the, inertial, frame, in, which, the, momenta, of, all, particles, sums, to, zero, is, called, the, center, of, momentum, frame, in, this, special, frame, the, relativistic, energy, momentum, equation, has, p, 0, and, thus, gives, the, invariant, mass, of, the, system, as, merely, the, total, energy, of, all, parts, of, the, system, divided, by, c, 2, this, is, the, invariant, mass, of, any, system, which, is, measured, in, a, frame, where, it, has, zero, total, momentum, such, as, a, bottle, of, hot, gas, on, a, scale, in, such, a, system, the, mass, which, the, scale, weighs, is, the, invariant, mass, and, it, depends, on, the, total, energy, of, the, system, it, is, thus, more, than, the, sum, of, the, rest, masses, of, the, molecules, but, also, includes, all, the, totaled, energies, in, the, system, as, well, like, energy, and, momentum, the, invariant, mass, of, isolated, systems, cannot, be, changed, so, long, as, the, system, remains, totally, closed, no, mass, or, energy, allowed, in, or, out, because, the, total, relativistic, energy, of, the, system, remains, constant, so, long, as, nothing, can, enter, or, leave, it, an, increase, in, the, energy, of, such, a, system, which, is, caused, by, translating, the, system, to, an, inertial, frame, which, is, not, the, center, of, momentum, frame, causes, an, increase, in, energy, and, momentum, without, an, increase, in, invariant, mass, e, m, 0, c, 2, however, applies, only, to, isolated, systems, in, their, center, of, momentum, frame, where, momentum, sums, to, zero, taking, this, formula, at, face, value, we, see, that, in, relativity, mass, is, simply, energy, by, another, name, and, measured, in, different, units, in, 1927, einstein, remarked, about, special, relativity, under, this, theory, mass, is, not, an, unalterable, magnitude, but, a, magnitude, dependent, on, and, indeed, identical, with, the, amount, of, energy, in, a, totally, closed, system, i, e, isolated, system, the, total, energy, the, total, momentum, and, hence, the, total, invariant, mass, are, conserved, einstein, s, formula, for, change, in, mass, translates, to, its, simplest, e, mc, 2, form, however, only, in, non, closed, systems, in, which, energy, is, allowed, to, escape, for, example, as, heat, and, light, and, thus, invariant, mass, is, reduced, einstein, s, equation, shows, that, such, systems, must, lose, mass, in, accordance, with, the, above, formula, in, proportion, to, the, energy, they, lose, to, the, surroundings, conversely, if, one, can, measure, the, differences, in, mass, between, a, system, before, it, undergoes, a, reaction, which, releases, heat, and, light, and, the, system, after, the, reaction, when, heat, and, light, have, escaped, one, can, estimate, the, amount, of, energy, which, escapes, the, system, in, both, nuclear, and, chemical, reactions, such, energy, represents, the, difference, in, binding, energies, of, electrons, in, atoms, for, chemistry, or, between, nucleons, in, nuclei, in, atomic, reactions, in, both, cases, the, mass, difference, between, reactants, and, cooled, products, measures, the, mass, of, heat, and, light, which, will, escape, the, reaction, and, thus, using, the, equation, give, the, equivalent, energy, of, heat, and, light, which, may, be, emitted, if, the, reaction, proceeds, in, chemistry, the, mass, differences, associated, with, the, emitted, energy, are, around, 10, 9, of, the, molecular, mass, however, in, nuclear, reactions, the, energies, are, so, large, that, they, are, associated, with, mass, differences, which, can, be, estimated, in, advance, if, the, products, and, reactants, have, been, weighed, atoms, can, be, weighed, indirectly, by, using, atomic, masses, which, are, always, the, same, for, each, nuclide, thus, einstein, s, formula, becomes, important, when, one, has, measured, the, masses, of, different, atomic, nuclei, by, looking, at, the, difference, in, masses, one, can, predict, which, nuclei, have, stored, energy, that, can, be, released, by, certain, nuclear, reactions, providing, important, information, which, was, useful, in, the, development, of, nuclear, energy, and, consequently, the, nuclear, bomb, historically, for, example, lise, meitner, was, able, to, use, the, mass, differences, in, nuclei, to, estimate, that, there, was, enough, energy, available, to, make, nuclear, fission, a, favorable, process, the, implications, of, this, special, form, of, einstein, s, formula, have, thus, made, it, one, of, the, most, famous, equations, in, all, of, science, the, equation, e, m, 0, c, 2, applies, only, to, isolated, systems, in, their, center, of, momentum, frame, it, has, been, popularly, misunderstood, to, mean, that, mass, may, be, converted, to, energy, after, which, the, mass, disappears, however, popular, explanations, of, the, equation, as, applied, to, systems, include, open, non, isolated, systems, for, which, heat, and, light, are, allowed, to, escape, when, they, otherwise, would, have, contributed, to, the, mass, invariant, mass, of, the, system, historically, confusion, about, mass, being, converted, to, energy, has, been, aided, by, confusion, between, mass, and, matter, where, matter, is, defined, as, fermion, particles, in, such, a, definition, electromagnetic, radiation, and, kinetic, energy, or, heat, are, not, considered, matter, in, some, situations, matter, may, indeed, be, converted, to, non, matter, forms, of, energy, see, above, but, in, all, these, situations, the, matter, and, non, matter, forms, of, energy, still, retain, their, original, mass, for, isolated, systems, closed, to, all, mass, and, energy, exchange, mass, never, disappears, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, because, energy, cannot, disappear, instead, this, equation, in, context, means, only, that, when, any, energy, is, added, to, or, escapes, from, a, system, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, the, system, will, be, measured, as, having, gained, or, lost, mass, in, proportion, to, energy, added, or, removed, thus, in, theory, if, an, atomic, bomb, were, placed, in, a, box, strong, enough, to, hold, its, blast, and, detonated, upon, a, scale, the, mass, of, this, closed, system, would, not, change, and, the, scale, would, not, move, only, when, a, transparent, window, was, opened, in, the, super, strong, plasma, filled, box, and, light, and, heat, were, allowed, to, escape, in, a, beam, and, the, bomb, components, to, cool, would, the, system, lose, the, mass, associated, with, the, energy, of, the, blast, in, a, 21, kiloton, bomb, for, example, about, a, gram, of, light, and, heat, is, created, if, this, heat, and, light, were, allowed, to, escape, the, remains, of, the, bomb, would, lose, a, gram, of, mass, as, it, cooled, in, this, thought, experiment, the, light, and, heat, carry, away, the, gram, of, mass, and, would, therefore, deposit, this, gram, of, mass, in, the, objects, that, absorb, them, in, relativistic, mechanics, the, time, varying, mass, moment, and, orbital, 3, angular, momentum, of, a, point, like, particle, are, combined, into, a, four, dimensional, bivector, in, terms, of, the, 4, position, x, and, the, 4, momentum, p, of, the, particle, where, denotes, the, exterior, product, this, tensor, is, additive, the, total, angular, momentum, of, a, system, is, the, sum, of, the, angular, momentum, tensors, for, each, constituent, of, the, system, so, for, an, assembly, of, discrete, particles, one, sums, the, angular, momentum, tensors, over, the, particles, or, integrates, the, density, of, angular, momentum, over, the, extent, of, a, continuous, mass, distribution, each, of, the, six, components, forms, a, conserved, quantity, when, aggregated, with, the, corresponding, components, for, other, objects, and, fields, in, special, relativity, newton, s, second, law, does, not, hold, in, the, form, f, m, a, but, it, does, if, it, is, expressed, as, where, p, v, m, 0, v, is, the, momentum, as, defined, above, and, m, 0, is, the, invariant, mass, thus, the, force, is, given, by, starting, from, carrying, out, the, derivatives, gives, if, the, acceleration, is, separated, into, the, part, parallel, to, the, velocity, a, and, the, part, perpendicular, to, it, a, so, that, one, gets, by, construction, a, and, v, are, parallel, so, v, a, v, is, a, vector, with, magnitude, v, 2, a, in, the, direction, of, v, and, hence, a, which, allows, the, replacement, then, consequently, in, some, old, texts, v, 3, m, 0, is, referred, to, as, the, longitudinal, mass, and, v, m, 0, is, referred, to, as, the, transverse, mass, which, is, numerically, the, same, as, the, relativistic, mass, see, mass, in, special, relativity, if, one, inverts, this, to, calculate, acceleration, from, force, one, gets, the, force, described, in, this, section, is, the, classical, 3, d, force, which, is, not, a, four, vector, this, 3, d, force, is, the, appropriate, concept, of, force, since, it, is, the, force, which, obeys, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, it, should, not, be, confused, with, the, so, called, four, force, which, is, merely, the, 3, d, force, in, the, comoving, frame, of, the, object, transformed, as, if, it, were, a, four, vector, however, the, density, of, 3, d, force, linear, momentum, transferred, per, unit, four, volume, is, a, four, vector, density, of, weight, 1, when, combined, with, the, negative, of, the, density, of, power, transferred, the, torque, acting, on, a, point, like, particle, is, defined, as, the, derivative, of, the, angular, momentum, tensor, given, above, with, respect, to, proper, time, or, in, tensor, components, where, f, is, the, 4d, force, acting, on, the, particle, at, the, event, x, as, with, angular, momentum, torque, is, additive, so, for, an, extended, object, one, sums, or, integrates, over, the, distribution, of, mass, the, work, energy, theorem, says, the, change, in, kinetic, energy, is, equal, to, the, work, done, on, the, body, in, special, relativity, if, in, the, initial, state, the, body, was, at, rest, so, v, 0, 0, and, 0, v, 0, 1, and, in, the, final, state, it, has, speed, v, 1, v, setting, 1, v, 1, v, the, kinetic, energy, is, then, a, result, that, can, be, directly, obtained, by, subtracting, the, rest, energy, m, 0, c, 2, from, the, total, relativistic, energy, v, m, 0, c, 2, the, lorentz, factor, v, can, be, expanded, into, a, taylor, series, or, binomial, series, for, v, c, 2, 1, obtaining, and, consequently, for, velocities, much, smaller, than, that, of, light, one, can, neglect, the, terms, with, c, 2, and, higher, in, the, denominator, these, formulas, then, reduce, to, the, standard, definitions, of, newtonian, kinetic, energy, and, momentum, this, is, as, it, should, be, for, special, relativity, must, agree, with, newtonian, mechanics, at, low, velocities
