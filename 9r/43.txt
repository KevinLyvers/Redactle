in, physics, an, electronvolt, symbol, ev, also, written, electron, volt, and, electron, volt, is, the, measure, of, an, amount, of, kinetic, energy, gained, by, a, single, electron, accelerating, through, an, electric, potential, difference, of, one, volt, in, vacuum, when, used, as, a, unit, of, energy, the, numerical, value, of, 1, ev, in, joules, symbol, j, is, equal, to, the, numerical, value, of, the, charge, of, an, electron, in, coulombs, symbol, c, under, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, this, sets, 1, ev, equal, to, the, exact, value, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, j, historically, the, electronvolt, was, devised, as, a, standard, unit, of, measure, through, its, usefulness, in, electrostatic, particle, accelerator, sciences, because, a, particle, with, electric, charge, q, gains, an, energy, e, qv, after, passing, through, a, voltage, of, v, an, electronvolt, is, the, amount, of, energy, gained, or, lost, by, a, single, electron, when, it, moves, through, an, electric, potential, difference, of, one, volt, hence, it, has, a, value, of, one, volt, which, is, 1, j, c, multiplied, by, the, elementary, charge, e, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, therefore, one, electronvolt, is, equal, to, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, j, the, electronvolt, ev, is, a, unit, of, energy, but, is, not, an, si, unit, it, is, a, commonly, used, unit, of, energy, within, physics, widely, used, in, solid, state, atomic, nuclear, and, particle, physics, and, high, energy, astrophysics, it, is, commonly, used, with, si, prefixes, milli, 10, 3, kilo, 10, 3, mega, 10, 6, giga, 10, 9, tera, 10, 12, peta, 10, 15, or, exa, 10, 18, the, respective, symbols, being, mev, kev, mev, gev, tev, pev, and, eev, the, si, unit, of, energy, is, the, joule, j, in, some, older, documents, and, in, the, name, bevatron, the, symbol, bev, is, used, where, the, b, stands, for, billion, the, symbol, bev, is, therefore, equivalent, to, gev, though, neither, is, an, si, unit, in, the, fields, of, physics, in, which, the, electronvolt, is, used, other, quantities, are, typically, measured, using, units, derived, from, the, electronvolt, as, a, product, with, fundamental, constants, of, importance, in, the, theory, are, often, used, by, mass, energy, equivalence, the, electronvolt, corresponds, to, a, unit, of, mass, it, is, common, in, particle, physics, where, units, of, mass, and, energy, are, often, interchanged, to, express, mass, in, units, of, ev, c, 2, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, from, e, mc, 2, it, is, common, to, informally, express, mass, in, terms, of, ev, as, a, unit, of, mass, effectively, using, a, system, of, natural, units, with, c, set, to, 1, the, kilogram, equivalent, of, 1, ev, c, 2, is, 1, ev, c, 2, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, 1, v,

0, 938, gev, c, 2, in, general, the, masses, of, all, hadrons, are, of, the, order, of, 1, gev, c, 2, which, makes, the, gev, c, 2, a, convenient, unit, of, mass, for, particle, physics, the, atomic, mass, constant, m, u, one, twelfth, of, the, mass, a, carbon, 12, atom, is, close, to, the, mass, of, a, proton, to, convert, to, electronvolt, mass, equivalent, use, the, formula, by, dividing, a,
