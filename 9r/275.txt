chemistry, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, properties, and, behavior, of, matter, it, is, a, physical, science, within, the, natural, sciences, that, studies, the, chemical, elements, that, make, up, matter, and, compounds, made, of, atoms, molecules, and, ions, their, composition, structure, properties, behavior, and, the, changes, they, undergo, during, reactions, with, other, substances, chemistry, also, addresses, the, nature, of, chemical, bonds, in, chemical, compounds, in, the, scope, of, its, subject, chemistry, occupies, an, intermediate, position, between, physics, and, biology, it, is, sometimes, called, the, central, science, because, it, provides, a, foundation, for, understanding, both, basic, and, applied, scientific, disciplines, at, a, fundamental, level, for, example, chemistry, explains, aspects, of, plant, growth, botany, the, formation, of, igneous, rocks, geology, how, atmospheric, ozone, is, formed, and, how, environmental, pollutants, are, degraded, ecology, the, properties, of, the, soil, on, the, moon, cosmochemistry, how, medications, work, pharmacology, and, how, to, collect, dna, evidence, at, a, crime, scene, forensics, chemistry, has, existed, under, various, names, since, ancient, times, it, has, evolved, and, now, chemistry, encompasses, various, areas, of, specialisation, or, subdisciplines, that, continue, to, increase, in, number, and, interrelate, to, create, further, interdisciplinary, fields, of, study, the, applications, of, various, fields, of, chemistry, are, used, frequently, for, economic, purposes, in, the, chemical, industry, the, word, chemistry, comes, from, a, modification, during, the, renaissance, of, the, word, alchemy, which, referred, to, an, earlier, set, of, practices, that, encompassed, elements, of, chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism, and, medicine, alchemy, is, often, associated, with, the, quest, to, turn, lead, or, other, base, metals, into, gold, though, alchemists, were, also, interested, in, many, of, the, questions, of, modern, chemistry, the, modern, word, alchemy, in, turn, is, derived, from, the, arabic, word, al, k, m, this, may, have, egyptian, origins, since, al, k, m, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, which, is, in, turn, derived, from, the, word, kemet, which, is, the, ancient, name, of, egypt, in, the, egyptian, language, alternately, al, k, m, may, derive, from, cast, together, the, current, model, of, atomic, structure, is, the, quantum, mechanical, model, traditional, chemistry, starts, with, the, study, of, elementary, particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals, and, other, aggregates, of, matter, matter, can, be, studied, in, solid, liquid, gas, and, plasma, states, in, isolation, or, in, combination, the, interactions, reactions, and, transformations, that, are, studied, in, chemistry, are, usually, the, result, of, interactions, between, atoms, leading, to, rearrangements, of, the, chemical, bonds, which, hold, atoms, together, such, behaviors, are, studied, in, a, chemistry, laboratory, the, chemistry, laboratory, stereotypically, uses, various, forms, of, laboratory, glassware, however, glassware, is, not, central, to, chemistry, and, a, great, deal, of, experimental, as, well, as, applied, industrial, chemistry, is, done, without, it, a, chemical, reaction, is, a, transformation, of, some, substances, into, one, or, more, different, substances, the, basis, of, such, a, chemical, transformation, is, the, rearrangement, of, electrons, in, the, chemical, bonds, between, atoms, it, can, be, symbolically, depicted, through, a, chemical, equation, which, usually, involves, atoms, as, subjects, the, number, of, atoms, on, the, left, and, the, right, in, the, equation, for, a, chemical, transformation, is, equal, when, the, number, of, atoms, on, either, side, is, unequal, the, transformation, is, referred, to, as, a, nuclear, reaction, or, radioactive, decay, the, type, of, chemical, reactions, a, substance, may, undergo, and, the, energy, changes, that, may, accompany, it, are, constrained, by, certain, basic, rules, known, as, chemical, laws, energy, and, entropy, considerations, are, invariably, important, in, almost, all, chemical, studies, chemical, substances, are, classified, in, terms, of, their, structure, phase, as, well, as, their, chemical, compositions, they, can, be, analyzed, using, the, tools, of, chemical, analysis, e, g, spectroscopy, and, chromatography, scientists, engaged, in, chemical, research, are, known, as, chemists, most, chemists, specialize, in, one, or, more, sub, disciplines, several, concepts, are, essential, for, the, study, of, chemistry, some, of, them, are, in, chemistry, matter, is, defined, as, anything, that, has, rest, mass, and, volume, it, takes, up, space, and, is, made, up, of, particles, the, particles, that, make, up, matter, have, rest, mass, as, well, not, all, particles, have, rest, mass, such, as, the, photon, matter, can, be, a, pure, chemical, substance, or, a, mixture, of, substances, the, atom, is, the, basic, unit, of, chemistry, it, consists, of, a, dense, core, called, the, atomic, nucleus, surrounded, by, a, space, occupied, by, an, electron, cloud, the, nucleus, is, made, up, of, positively, charged, protons, and, uncharged, neutrons, together, called, nucleons, while, the, electron, cloud, consists, of, negatively, charged, electrons, which, orbit, the, nucleus, in, a, neutral, atom, the, negatively, charged, electrons, balance, out, the, positive, charge, of, the, protons, the, nucleus, is, dense, the, mass, of, a, nucleon, is, approximately, 1, 836, times, that, of, an, electron, yet, the, radius, of, an, atom, is, about, 10, 000, times, that, of, its, nucleus, the, atom, is, also, the, smallest, entity, that, can, be, envisaged, to, retain, the, chemical, properties, of, the, element, such, as, electronegativity, ionization, potential, preferred, oxidation, state, s, coordination, number, and, preferred, types, of, bonds, to, form, e, g, metallic, ionic, covalent, a, chemical, element, is, a, pure, substance, which, is, composed, of, a, single, type, of, atom, characterized, by, its, particular, number, of, protons, in, the, nuclei, of, its, atoms, known, as, the, atomic, number, and, represented, by, the, symbol, z, the, mass, number, is, the, sum, of, the, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, in, a, nucleus, although, all, the, nuclei, of, all, atoms, belonging, to, one, element, will, have, the, same, atomic, number, they, may, not, necessarily, have, the, same, mass, number, atoms, of, an, element, which, have, different, mass, numbers, are, known, as, isotopes, for, example, all, atoms, with, 6, protons, in, their, nuclei, are, atoms, of, the, chemical, element, carbon, but, atoms, of, carbon, may, have, mass, numbers, of, 12, or, 13, the, standard, presentation, of, the, chemical, elements, is, in, the, periodic, table, which, orders, elements, by, atomic, number, the, periodic, table, is, arranged, in, groups, or, columns, and, periods, or, rows, the, periodic, table, is, useful, in, identifying, periodic, trends, a, compound, is, a, pure, chemical, substance, composed, of, more, than, one, element, the, properties, of, a, compound, bear, little, similarity, to, those, of, its, elements, the, standard, nomenclature, of, compounds, is, set, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, organic, compounds, are, named, according, to, the, organic, nomenclature, system, the, names, for, inorganic, compounds, are, created, according, to, the, inorganic, nomenclature, system, when, a, compound, has, more, than, one, component, then, they, are, divided, into, two, classes, the, electropositive, and, the, electronegative, components, in, addition, the, chemical, abstracts, service, has, devised, a, method, to, index, chemical, substances, in, this, scheme, each, chemical, substance, is, identifiable, by, a, number, known, as, its, cas, registry, number, a, molecule, is, the, smallest, indivisible, portion, of, a, pure, chemical, substance, that, has, its, unique, set, of, chemical, properties, that, is, its, potential, to, undergo, a, certain, set, of, chemical, reactions, with, other, substances, however, this, definition, only, works, well, for, substances, that, are, composed, of, molecules, which, is, not, true, of, many, substances, see, below, molecules, are, typically, a, set, of, atoms, bound, together, by, covalent, bonds, such, that, the, structure, is, electrically, neutral, and, all, valence, electrons, are, paired, with, other, electrons, either, in, bonds, or, in, lone, pairs, thus, molecules, exist, as, electrically, neutral, units, unlike, ions, when, this, rule, is, broken, giving, the, molecule, a, charge, the, result, is, sometimes, named, a, molecular, ion, or, a, polyatomic, ion, however, the, discrete, and, separate, nature, of, the, molecular, concept, usually, requires, that, molecular, ions, be, present, only, in, well, separated, form, such, as, a, directed, beam, in, a, vacuum, in, a, mass, spectrometer, charged, polyatomic, collections, residing, in, solids, for, example, common, sulfate, or, nitrate, ions, are, generally, not, considered, molecules, in, chemistry, some, molecules, contain, one, or, more, unpaired, electrons, creating, radicals, most, radicals, are, comparatively, reactive, but, some, such, as, nitric, oxide, no, can, be, stable, the, inert, or, noble, gas, elements, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and, radon, are, composed, of, lone, atoms, as, their, smallest, discrete, unit, but, the, other, isolated, chemical, elements, consist, of, either, molecules, or, networks, of, atoms, bonded, to, each, other, in, some, way, identifiable, molecules, compose, familiar, substances, such, as, water, air, and, many, organic, compounds, like, alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and, the, various, pharmaceuticals, however, not, all, substances, or, chemical, compounds, consist, of, discrete, molecules, and, indeed, most, of, the, solid, substances, that, make, up, the, solid, crust, mantle, and, core, of, the, earth, are, chemical, compounds, without, molecules, these, other, types, of, substances, such, as, ionic, compounds, and, network, solids, are, organized, in, such, a, way, as, to, lack, the, existence, of, identifiable, molecules, per, se, instead, these, substances, are, discussed, in, terms, of, formula, units, or, unit, cells, as, the, smallest, repeating, structure, within, the, substance, examples, of, such, substances, are, mineral, salts, such, as, table, salt, solids, like, carbon, and, diamond, metals, and, familiar, silica, and, silicate, minerals, such, as, quartz, and, granite, one, of, the, main, characteristics, of, a, molecule, is, its, geometry, often, called, its, structure, while, the, structure, of, diatomic, triatomic, or, tetra, atomic, molecules, may, be, trivial, linear, angular, pyramidal, etc, the, structure, of, polyatomic, molecules, that, are, constituted, of, more, than, six, atoms, of, several, elements, can, be, crucial, for, its, chemical, nature, a, chemical, substance, is, a, kind, of, matter, with, a, definite, composition, and, set, of, properties, a, collection, of, substances, is, called, a, mixture, examples, of, mixtures, are, air, and, alloys, the, mole, is, a, unit, of, measurement, that, denotes, an, amount, of, substance, also, called, chemical, amount, one, mole, is, defined, to, contain, exactly, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, particles, atoms, molecules, ions, or, electrons, where, the, number, of, particles, per, mole, is, known, as, the, avogadro, constant, molar, concentration, is, the, amount, of, a, particular, substance, per, volume, of, solution, and, is, commonly, reported, in, mol, dm, 3, in, addition, to, the, specific, chemical, properties, that, distinguish, different, chemical, classifications, chemicals, can, exist, in, several, phases, for, the, most, part, the, chemical, classifications, are, independent, of, these, bulk, phase, classifications, however, some, more, exotic, phases, are, incompatible, with, certain, chemical, properties, a, phase, is, a, set, of, states, of, a, chemical, system, that, have, similar, bulk, structural, properties, over, a, range, of, conditions, such, as, pressure, or, temperature, physical, properties, such, as, density, and, refractive, index, tend, to, fall, within, values, characteristic, of, the, phase, the, phase, of, matter, is, defined, by, the, phase, transition, which, is, when, energy, put, into, or, taken, out, of, the, system, goes, into, rearranging, the, structure, of, the, system, instead, of, changing, the, bulk, conditions, sometimes, the, distinction, between, phases, can, be, continuous, instead, of, having, a, discrete, boundary, in, this, case, the, matter, is, considered, to, be, in, a, supercritical, state, when, three, states, meet, based, on, the, conditions, it, is, known, as, a, triple, point, and, since, this, is, invariant, it, is, a, convenient, way, to, define, a, set, of, conditions, the, most, familiar, examples, of, phases, are, solids, liquids, and, gases, many, substances, exhibit, multiple, solid, phases, for, example, there, are, three, phases, of, solid, iron, alpha, gamma, and, delta, that, vary, based, on, temperature, and, pressure, a, principal, difference, between, solid, phases, is, the, crystal, structure, or, arrangement, of, the, atoms, another, phase, commonly, encountered, in, the, study, of, chemistry, is, the, aqueous, phase, which, is, the, state, of, substances, dissolved, in, aqueous, solution, that, is, in, water, less, familiar, phases, include, plasmas, bose, einstein, condensates, and, fermionic, condensates, and, the, paramagnetic, and, ferromagnetic, phases, of, magnetic, materials, while, most, familiar, phases, deal, with, three, dimensional, systems, it, is, also, possible, to, define, analogs, in, two, dimensional, systems, which, has, received, attention, for, its, relevance, to, systems, in, biology, atoms, sticking, together, in, molecules, or, crystals, are, said, to, be, bonded, with, one, another, a, chemical, bond, may, be, visualized, as, the, multipole, balance, between, the, positive, charges, in, the, nuclei, and, the, negative, charges, oscillating, about, them, more, than, simple, attraction, and, repulsion, the, energies, and, distributions, characterize, the, availability, of, an, electron, to, bond, to, another, atom, the, chemical, bond, can, be, a, covalent, bond, an, ionic, bond, a, hydrogen, bond, or, just, because, of, van, der, waals, force, each, of, these, kinds, of, bonds, is, ascribed, to, some, potential, these, potentials, create, the, interactions, which, hold, atoms, together, in, molecules, or, crystals, in, many, simple, compounds, valence, bond, theory, the, valence, shell, electron, pair, repulsion, model, vsepr, and, the, concept, of, oxidation, number, can, be, used, to, explain, molecular, structure, and, composition, an, ionic, bond, is, formed, when, a, metal, loses, one, or, more, of, its, electrons, becoming, a, positively, charged, cation, and, the, electrons, are, then, gained, by, the, non, metal, atom, becoming, a, negatively, charged, anion, the, two, oppositely, charged, ions, attract, one, another, and, the, ionic, bond, is, the, electrostatic, force, of, attraction, between, them, for, example, sodium, na, a, metal, loses, one, electron, to, become, an, na, cation, while, chlorine, cl, a, non, metal, gains, this, electron, to, become, cl, the, ions, are, held, together, due, to, electrostatic, attraction, and, that, compound, sodium, chloride, nacl, or, common, table, salt, is, formed, in, a, covalent, bond, one, or, more, pairs, of, valence, electrons, are, shared, by, two, atoms, the, resulting, electrically, neutral, group, of, bonded, atoms, is, termed, a, molecule, atoms, will, share, valence, electrons, in, such, a, way, as, to, create, a, noble, gas, electron, configuration, eight, electrons, in, their, outermost, shell, for, each, atom, atoms, that, tend, to, combine, in, such, a, way, that, they, each, have, eight, electrons, in, their, valence, shell, are, said, to, follow, the, octet, rule, however, some, elements, like, hydrogen, and, lithium, need, only, two, electrons, in, their, outermost, shell, to, attain, this, stable, configuration, these, atoms, are, said, to, follow, the, duet, rule, and, in, this, way, they, are, reaching, the, electron, configuration, of, the, noble, gas, helium, which, has, two, electrons, in, its, outer, shell, similarly, theories, from, classical, physics, can, be, used, to, predict, many, ionic, structures, with, more, complicated, compounds, such, as, metal, complexes, valence, bond, theory, is, less, applicable, and, alternative, approaches, such, as, the, molecular, orbital, theory, are, generally, used, see, diagram, on, electronic, orbitals, in, the, context, of, chemistry, energy, is, an, attribute, of, a, substance, as, a, consequence, of, its, atomic, molecular, or, aggregate, structure, since, a, chemical, transformation, is, accompanied, by, a, change, in, one, or, more, of, these, kinds, of, structures, it, is, invariably, accompanied, by, an, increase, or, decrease, of, energy, of, the, substances, involved, some, energy, is, transferred, between, the, surroundings, and, the, reactants, of, the, reaction, in, the, form, of, heat, or, light, thus, the, products, of, a, reaction, may, have, more, or, less, energy, than, the, reactants, a, reaction, is, said, to, be, exergonic, if, the, final, state, is, lower, on, the, energy, scale, than, the, initial, state, in, the, case, of, endergonic, reactions, the, situation, is, the, reverse, a, reaction, is, said, to, be, exothermic, if, the, reaction, releases, heat, to, the, surroundings, in, the, case, of, endothermic, reactions, the, reaction, absorbs, heat, from, the, surroundings, chemical, reactions, are, invariably, not, possible, unless, the, reactants, surmount, an, energy, barrier, known, as, the, activation, energy, the, speed, of, a, chemical, reaction, at, given, temperature, t, is, related, to, the, activation, energy, e, by, the, boltzmann, s, population, factor, e, e, k, t, displaystyle, e, e, kt, that, is, the, probability, of, a, molecule, to, have, energy, greater, than, or, equal, to, e, at, the, given, temperature, t, this, exponential, dependence, of, a, reaction, rate, on, temperature, is, known, as, the, arrhenius, equation, the, activation, energy, necessary, for, a, chemical, reaction, to, occur, can, be, in, the, form, of, heat, light, electricity, or, mechanical, force, in, the, form, of, ultrasound, a, related, concept, free, energy, which, also, incorporates, entropy, considerations, is, a, very, useful, means, for, predicting, the, feasibility, of, a, reaction, and, determining, the, state, of, equilibrium, of, a, chemical, reaction, in, chemical, thermodynamics, a, reaction, is, feasible, only, if, the, total, change, in, the, gibbs, free, energy, is, negative, g, 0, displaystyle, delta, g, leq, 0, if, it, is, equal, to, zero, the, chemical, reaction, is, said, to, be, at, equilibrium, there, exist, only, limited, possible, states, of, energy, for, electrons, atoms, and, molecules, these, are, determined, by, the, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, which, require, quantization, of, energy, of, a, bound, system, the, atoms, molecules, in, a, higher, energy, state, are, said, to, be, excited, the, molecules, atoms, of, substance, in, an, excited, energy, state, are, often, much, more, reactive, that, is, more, amenable, to, chemical, reactions, the, phase, of, a, substance, is, invariably, determined, by, its, energy, and, the, energy, of, its, surroundings, when, the, intermolecular, forces, of, a, substance, are, such, that, the, energy, of, the, surroundings, is, not, sufficient, to, overcome, them, it, occurs, in, a, more, ordered, phase, like, liquid, or, solid, as, is, the, case, with, water, h, 2, o, a, liquid, at, room, temperature, because, its, molecules, are, bound, by, hydrogen, bonds, whereas, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, is, a, gas, at, room, temperature, and, standard, pressure, as, its, molecules, are, bound, by, weaker, dipole, dipole, interactions, the, transfer, of, energy, from, one, chemical, substance, to, another, depends, on, the, size, of, energy, quanta, emitted, from, one, substance, however, heat, energy, is, often, transferred, more, easily, from, almost, any, substance, to, another, because, the, phonons, responsible, for, vibrational, and, rotational, energy, levels, in, a, substance, have, much, less, energy, than, photons, invoked, for, the, electronic, energy, transfer, thus, because, vibrational, and, rotational, energy, levels, are, more, closely, spaced, than, electronic, energy, levels, heat, is, more, easily, transferred, between, substances, relative, to, light, or, other, forms, of, electronic, energy, for, example, ultraviolet, electromagnetic, radiation, is, not, transferred, with, as, much, efficacy, from, one, substance, to, another, as, thermal, or, electrical, energy, the, existence, of, characteristic, energy, levels, for, different, chemical, substances, is, useful, for, their, identification, by, the, analysis, of, spectral, lines, different, kinds, of, spectra, are, often, used, in, chemical, spectroscopy, e, g, ir, microwave, nmr, esr, etc, spectroscopy, is, also, used, to, identify, the, composition, of, remote, objects, like, stars, and, distant, galaxies, by, analyzing, their, radiation, spectra, the, term, chemical, energy, is, often, used, to, indicate, the, potential, of, a, chemical, substance, to, undergo, a, transformation, through, a, chemical, reaction, or, to, transform, other, chemical, substances, when, a, chemical, substance, is, transformed, as, a, result, of, its, interaction, with, another, substance, or, with, energy, a, chemical, reaction, is, said, to, have, occurred, a, chemical, reaction, is, therefore, a, concept, related, to, the, reaction, of, a, substance, when, it, comes, in, close, contact, with, another, whether, as, a, mixture, or, a, solution, exposure, to, some, form, of, energy, or, both, it, results, in, some, energy, exchange, between, the, constituents, of, the, reaction, as, well, as, with, the, system, environment, which, may, be, designed, vessels, often, laboratory, glassware, chemical, reactions, can, result, in, the, formation, or, dissociation, of, molecules, that, is, molecules, breaking, apart, to, form, two, or, more, molecules, or, rearrangement, of, atoms, within, or, across, molecules, chemical, reactions, usually, involve, the, making, or, breaking, of, chemical, bonds, oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid, base, neutralization, and, molecular, rearrangement, are, some, examples, of, common, chemical, reactions, a, chemical, reaction, can, be, symbolically, depicted, through, a, chemical, equation, while, in, a, non, nuclear, chemical, reaction, the, number, and, kind, of, atoms, on, both, sides, of, the, equation, are, equal, for, a, nuclear, reaction, this, holds, true, only, for, the, nuclear, particles, viz, protons, and, neutrons, the, sequence, of, steps, in, which, the, reorganization, of, chemical, bonds, may, be, taking, place, in, the, course, of, a, chemical, reaction, is, called, its, mechanism, a, chemical, reaction, can, be, envisioned, to, take, place, in, a, number, of, steps, each, of, which, may, have, a, different, speed, many, reaction, intermediates, with, variable, stability, can, thus, be, envisaged, during, the, course, of, a, reaction, reaction, mechanisms, are, proposed, to, explain, the, kinetics, and, the, relative, product, mix, of, a, reaction, many, physical, chemists, specialize, in, exploring, and, proposing, the, mechanisms, of, various, chemical, reactions, several, empirical, rules, like, the, woodward, hoffmann, rules, often, come, in, handy, while, proposing, a, mechanism, for, a, chemical, reaction, according, to, the, iupac, gold, book, a, chemical, reaction, is, a, process, that, results, in, the, interconversion, of, chemical, species, accordingly, a, chemical, reaction, may, be, an, elementary, reaction, or, a, stepwise, reaction, an, additional, caveat, is, made, in, that, this, definition, includes, cases, where, the, interconversion, of, conformers, is, experimentally, observable, such, detectable, chemical, reactions, normally, involve, sets, of, molecular, entities, as, indicated, by, this, definition, but, it, is, often, conceptually, convenient, to, use, the, term, also, for, changes, involving, single, molecular, entities, i, e, microscopic, chemical, events, an, ion, is, a, charged, species, an, atom, or, a, molecule, that, has, lost, or, gained, one, or, more, electrons, when, an, atom, loses, an, electron, and, thus, has, more, protons, than, electrons, the, atom, is, a, positively, charged, ion, or, cation, when, an, atom, gains, an, electron, and, thus, has, more, electrons, than, protons, the, atom, is, a, negatively, charged, ion, or, anion, cations, and, anions, can, form, a, crystalline, lattice, of, neutral, salts, such, as, the, na, and, cl, ions, forming, sodium, chloride, or, nacl, examples, of, polyatomic, ions, that, do, not, split, up, during, acid, base, reactions, are, hydroxide, oh, and, phosphate, po, 4, 3, plasma, is, composed, of, gaseous, matter, that, has, been, completely, ionized, usually, through, high, temperature, a, substance, can, often, be, classified, as, an, acid, or, a, base, there, are, several, different, theories, which, explain, acid, base, behavior, the, simplest, is, arrhenius, theory, which, states, that, acid, is, a, substance, that, produces, hydronium, ions, when, it, is, dissolved, in, water, and, a, base, is, one, that, produces, hydroxide, ions, when, dissolved, in, water, according, to, br, nsted, lowry, acid, base, theory, acids, are, substances, that, donate, a, positive, hydrogen, ion, to, another, substance, in, a, chemical, reaction, by, extension, a, base, is, the, substance, which, receives, that, hydrogen, ion, a, third, common, theory, is, lewis, acid, base, theory, which, is, based, on, the, formation, of, new, chemical, bonds, lewis, theory, explains, that, an, acid, is, a, substance, which, is, capable, of, accepting, a, pair, of, electrons, from, another, substance, during, the, process, of, bond, formation, while, a, base, is, a, substance, which, can, provide, a, pair, of, electrons, to, form, a, new, bond, there, are, several, other, ways, in, which, a, substance, may, be, classified, as, an, acid, or, a, base, as, is, evident, in, the, history, of, this, concept, acid, strength, is, commonly, measured, by, two, methods, one, measurement, based, on, the, arrhenius, definition, of, acidity, is, ph, which, is, a, measurement, of, the, hydronium, ion, concentration, in, a, solution, as, expressed, on, a, negative, logarithmic, scale, thus, solutions, that, have, a, low, ph, have, a, high, hydronium, ion, concentration, and, can, be, said, to, be, more, acidic, the, other, measurement, based, on, the, br, nsted, lowry, definition, is, the, acid, dissociation, constant, k, a, which, measures, the, relative, ability, of, a, substance, to, act, as, an, acid, under, the, br, nsted, lowry, definition, of, an, acid, that, is, substances, with, a, higher, k, a, are, more, likely, to, donate, hydrogen, ions, in, chemical, reactions, than, those, with, lower, k, a, values, redox, red, uction, ox, idation, reactions, include, all, chemical, reactions, in, which, atoms, have, their, oxidation, state, changed, by, either, gaining, electrons, reduction, or, losing, electrons, oxidation, substances, that, have, the, ability, to, oxidize, other, substances, are, said, to, be, oxidative, and, are, known, as, oxidizing, agents, oxidants, or, oxidizers, an, oxidant, removes, electrons, from, another, substance, similarly, substances, that, have, the, ability, to, reduce, other, substances, are, said, to, be, reductive, and, are, known, as, reducing, agents, reductants, or, reducers, a, reductant, transfers, electrons, to, another, substance, and, is, thus, oxidized, itself, and, because, it, donates, electrons, it, is, also, called, an, electron, donor, oxidation, and, reduction, properly, refer, to, a, change, in, oxidation, number, the, actual, transfer, of, electrons, may, never, occur, thus, oxidation, is, better, defined, as, an, increase, in, oxidation, number, and, reduction, as, a, decrease, in, oxidation, number, although, the, concept, of, equilibrium, is, widely, used, across, sciences, in, the, context, of, chemistry, it, arises, whenever, a, number, of, different, states, of, the, chemical, composition, are, possible, as, for, example, in, a, mixture, of, several, chemical, compounds, that, can, react, with, one, another, or, when, a, substance, can, be, present, in, more, than, one, kind, of, phase, a, system, of, chemical, substances, at, equilibrium, even, though, having, an, unchanging, composition, is, most, often, not, static, molecules, of, the, substances, continue, to, react, with, one, another, thus, giving, rise, to, a, dynamic, equilibrium, thus, the, concept, describes, the, state, in, which, the, parameters, such, as, chemical, composition, remain, unchanged, over, time, chemical, reactions, are, governed, by, certain, laws, which, have, become, fundamental, concepts, in, chemistry, some, of, them, are, the, history, of, chemistry, spans, a, period, from, the, ancient, past, to, the, present, since, several, millennia, bc, civilizations, were, using, technologies, that, would, eventually, form, the, basis, of, the, various, branches, of, chemistry, examples, include, extracting, metals, from, ores, making, pottery, and, glazes, fermenting, beer, and, wine, extracting, chemicals, from, plants, for, medicine, and, perfume, rendering, fat, into, soap, making, glass, and, making, alloys, like, bronze, chemistry, was, preceded, by, its, protoscience, alchemy, which, operated, a, non, scientific, approach, to, understanding, the, constituents, of, matter, and, their, interactions, despite, being, unsuccessful, in, explaining, the, nature, of, matter, and, its, transformations, alchemists, set, the, stage, for, modern, chemistry, by, performing, experiments, and, recording, the, results, robert, boyle, although, skeptical, of, elements, and, convinced, of, alchemy, played, a, key, part, in, elevating, the, sacred, art, as, an, independent, fundamental, and, philosophical, discipline, in, his, work, the, sceptical, chymist, 1661, while, both, alchemy, and, chemistry, are, concerned, with, matter, and, its, transformations, the, crucial, difference, was, given, by, the, scientific, method, that, chemists, employed, in, their, work, chemistry, as, a, body, of, knowledge, distinct, from, alchemy, became, an, established, science, with, the, work, of, antoine, lavoisier, who, developed, a, law, of, conservation, of, mass, that, demanded, careful, measurement, and, quantitative, observations, of, chemical, phenomena, the, history, of, chemistry, afterwards, is, intertwined, with, the, history, of, thermodynamics, especially, through, the, work, of, willard, gibbs, the, definition, of, chemistry, has, changed, over, time, as, new, discoveries, and, theories, add, to, the, functionality, of, the, science, the, term, chymistry, in, the, view, of, noted, scientist, robert, boyle, in, 1661, meant, the, subject, of, the, material, principles, of, mixed, bodies, in, 1663, the, chemist, christopher, glaser, described, chymistry, as, a, scientific, art, by, which, one, learns, to, dissolve, bodies, and, draw, from, them, the, different, substances, on, their, composition, and, how, to, unite, them, again, and, exalt, them, to, a, higher, perfection, the, 1730, definition, of, the, word, chemistry, as, used, by, georg, ernst, stahl, meant, the, art, of, resolving, mixed, compound, or, aggregate, bodies, into, their, principles, and, of, composing, such, bodies, from, those, principles, in, 1837, jean, baptiste, dumas, considered, the, word, chemistry, to, refer, to, the, science, concerned, with, the, laws, and, effects, of, molecular, forces, this, definition, further, evolved, until, in, 1947, it, came, to, mean, the, science, of, substances, their, structure, their, properties, and, the, reactions, that, change, them, into, other, substances, a, characterization, accepted, by, linus, pauling, more, recently, in, 1998, professor, raymond, chang, broadened, the, definition, of, chemistry, to, mean, the, study, of, matter, and, the, changes, it, undergoes, early, civilizations, such, as, the, egyptians, babylonians, and, indians, amassed, practical, knowledge, concerning, the, arts, of, metallurgy, pottery, and, dyes, but, did, not, develop, a, systematic, theory, a, basic, chemical, hypothesis, first, emerged, in, classical, greece, with, the, theory, of, four, elements, as, propounded, definitively, by, aristotle, stating, that, fire, air, earth, and, water, were, the, fundamental, elements, from, which, everything, is, formed, as, a, combination, greek, atomism, dates, back, to, 440, bc, arising, in, works, by, philosophers, such, as, democritus, and, epicurus, in, 50, bce, the, roman, philosopher, lucretius, expanded, upon, the, theory, in, his, poem, de, rerum, natura, on, the, nature, of, things, unlike, modern, concepts, of, science, greek, atomism, was, purely, philosophical, in, nature, with, little, concern, for, empirical, observations, and, no, concern, for, chemical, experiments, an, early, form, of, the, idea, of, conservation, of, mass, is, the, notion, that, nothing, comes, from, nothing, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, which, can, be, found, in, empedocles, approx, 4th, century, bc, for, it, is, impossible, for, anything, to, come, to, be, from, what, is, not, and, it, cannot, be, brought, about, or, heard, of, that, what, is, should, be, utterly, destroyed, and, epicurus, 3rd, century, bc, who, describing, the, nature, of, the, universe, wrote, that, the, totality, of, things, was, always, such, as, it, is, now, and, always, will, be, in, the, hellenistic, world, the, art, of, alchemy, first, proliferated, mingling, magic, and, occultism, into, the, study, of, natural, substances, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, transmuting, elements, into, gold, and, discovering, the, elixir, of, eternal, life, work, particularly, the, development, of, distillation, continued, in, the, early, byzantine, period, with, the, most, famous, practitioner, being, the, 4th, century, greek, egyptian, zosimos, of, panopolis, alchemy, continued, to, be, developed, and, practised, throughout, the, arab, world, after, the, muslim, conquests, and, from, there, and, from, the, byzantine, remnants, diffused, into, medieval, and, renaissance, europe, through, latin, translations, the, arabic, works, attributed, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, introduced, a, systematic, classification, of, chemical, substances, and, provided, instructions, for, deriving, an, inorganic, compound, sal, ammoniac, or, ammonium, chloride, from, organic, substances, such, as, plants, blood, and, hair, by, chemical, means, some, arabic, jabirian, works, e, g, the, book, of, mercy, and, the, book, of, seventy, were, later, translated, into, latin, under, the, latinized, name, geber, and, in, 13th, century, europe, an, anonymous, writer, usually, referred, to, as, pseudo, geber, started, to, produce, alchemical, and, metallurgical, writings, under, this, name, later, influential, muslim, philosophers, such, as, ab, al, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, and, avicenna, disputed, the, theories, of, alchemy, particularly, the, theory, of, the, transmutation, of, metals, improvements, of, the, refining, of, ores, and, their, extractions, to, smelt, metals, was, widely, used, source, of, information, for, early, chemists, in, the, 16th, century, among, them, georg, agricola, 1494, 1555, who, published, his, major, work, de, re, metallica, in, 1556, his, work, describing, highly, developed, and, complex, processes, of, mining, metal, ores, and, metal, extraction, were, the, pinnacle, of, metallurgy, during, that, time, his, approach, removed, all, mysticism, associated, with, the, subject, creating, the, practical, base, upon, which, others, could, and, would, build, the, work, describes, the, many, kinds, of, furnace, used, to, smelt, ore, and, stimulated, interest, in, minerals, and, their, composition, agricola, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, metallurgy, and, the, founder, of, geology, as, a, scientific, discipline, under, the, influence, of, the, new, empirical, methods, propounded, by, sir, francis, bacon, and, others, a, group, of, chemists, at, oxford, robert, boyle, robert, hooke, and, john, mayow, began, to, reshape, the, old, alchemical, traditions, into, a, scientific, discipline, boyle, in, particular, questioned, some, commonly, held, chemical, theories, and, argued, for, chemical, practitioners, to, be, more, philosophical, and, less, commercially, focused, in, the, sceptical, chemyst, he, formulated, boyle, s, law, rejected, the, classical, four, elements, and, proposed, a, mechanistic, alternative, of, atoms, and, chemical, reactions, that, could, be, subject, to, rigorous, experiment, in, the, following, decades, many, important, discoveries, were, made, such, as, the, nature, of, air, which, was, discovered, to, be, composed, of, many, different, gases, the, scottish, chemist, joseph, black, and, the, flemish, jan, baptist, van, helmont, discovered, carbon, dioxide, or, what, black, called, fixed, air, in, 1754, henry, cavendish, discovered, hydrogen, and, elucidated, its, properties, and, joseph, priestley, and, independently, carl, wilhelm, scheele, isolated, pure, oxygen, the, theory, of, phlogiston, a, substance, at, the, root, of, all, combustion, was, propounded, by, the, german, georg, ernst, stahl, in, the, early, 18th, century, and, was, only, overturned, by, the, end, of, the, century, by, the, french, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, the, chemical, analogue, of, newton, in, physics, lavoisier, did, more, than, any, other, to, establish, the, new, science, on, proper, theoretical, footing, by, elucidating, the, principle, of, conservation, of, mass, and, developing, a, new, system, of, chemical, nomenclature, used, to, this, day, english, scientist, john, dalton, proposed, the, modern, theory, of, atoms, that, all, substances, are, composed, of, indivisible, atoms, of, matter, and, that, different, atoms, have, varying, atomic, weights, the, development, of, the, electrochemical, theory, of, chemical, combinations, occurred, in, the, early, 19th, century, as, the, result, of, the, work, of, two, scientists, in, particular, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, and, humphry, davy, made, possible, by, the, prior, invention, of, the, voltaic, pile, by, alessandro, volta, davy, discovered, nine, new, elements, including, the, alkali, metals, by, extracting, them, from, their, oxides, with, electric, current, british, william, prout, first, proposed, ordering, all, the, elements, by, their, atomic, weight, as, all, atoms, had, a, weight, that, was, an, exact, multiple, of, the, atomic, weight, of, hydrogen, j, a, r, newlands, devised, an, early, table, of, elements, which, was, then, developed, into, the, modern, periodic, table, of, elements, in, the, 1860s, by, dmitri, mendeleev, and, independently, by, several, other, scientists, including, julius, lothar, meyer, the, inert, gases, later, called, the, noble, gases, were, discovered, by, william, ramsay, in, collaboration, with, lord, rayleigh, at, the, end, of, the, century, thereby, filling, in, the, basic, structure, of, the, table, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, the, theoretical, underpinnings, of, chemistry, were, finally, understood, due, to, a, series, of, remarkable, discoveries, that, succeeded, in, probing, and, discovering, the, very, nature, of, the, internal, structure, of, atoms, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, of, the, university, of, cambridge, discovered, the, electron, and, soon, after, the, french, scientist, becquerel, as, well, as, the, couple, pierre, and, marie, curie, investigated, the, phenomenon, of, radioactivity, in, a, series, of, pioneering, scattering, experiments, ernest, rutherford, at, the, university, of, manchester, discovered, the, internal, structure, of, the, atom, and, the, existence, of, the, proton, classified, and, explained, the, different, types, of, radioactivity, and, successfully, transmuted, the, first, element, by, bombarding, nitrogen, with, alpha, particles, his, work, on, atomic, structure, was, improved, on, by, his, students, the, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, the, englishman, henry, moseley, and, the, german, otto, hahn, who, went, on, to, father, the, emerging, nuclear, chemistry, and, discovered, nuclear, fission, the, electronic, theory, of, chemical, bonds, and, molecular, orbitals, was, developed, by, the, american, scientists, linus, pauling, and, gilbert, n, lewis, the, year, 2011, was, declared, by, the, united, nations, as, the, international, year, of, chemistry, it, was, an, initiative, of, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, and, of, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, and, involves, chemical, societies, academics, and, institutions, worldwide, and, relied, on, individual, initiatives, to, organize, local, and, regional, activities, organic, chemistry, was, developed, by, justus, von, liebig, and, others, following, friedrich, w, hler, s, synthesis, of, urea, other, crucial, 19th, century, advances, were, an, understanding, of, valence, bonding, edward, frankland, in, 1852, and, the, application, of, thermodynamics, to, chemistry, j, w, gibbs, and, svante, arrhenius, in, the, 1870s, in, the, practice, of, chemistry, pure, chemistry, is, the, study, of, the, fundamental, principles, of, chemistry, while, applied, chemistry, applies, that, knowledge, to, develop, technology, and, solve, real, world, problems, chemistry, is, typically, divided, into, several, major, sub, disciplines, there, are, also, several, main, cross, disciplinary, and, more, specialized, fields, of, chemistry, others,
