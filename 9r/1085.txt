in, physics, mathematics, engineering, and, related, fields, a, wave, is, a, propagating, dynamic, disturbance, change, from, equilibrium, of, one, or, more, quantities, periodic, waves, oscillate, repeatedly, about, an, equilibrium, resting, value, at, some, frequency, when, the, entire, waveform, moves, in, one, direction, it, is, said, to, be, a, travelling, wave, by, contrast, a, pair, of, superimposed, periodic, waves, traveling, in, opposite, directions, makes, a, standing, wave, in, a, standing, wave, the, amplitude, of, vibration, has, nulls, at, some, positions, where, the, wave, amplitude, appears, smaller, or, even, zero, there, are, two, types, of, waves, that, are, most, commonly, studied, in, classical, physics, mechanical, waves, and, electromagnetic, waves, in, a, mechanical, wave, stress, and, strain, fields, oscillate, about, a, mechanical, equilibrium, a, mechanical, wave, is, a, local, deformation, strain, in, some, physical, medium, that, propagates, from, particle, to, particle, by, creating, local, stresses, that, cause, strain, in, neighboring, particles, too, for, example, sound, waves, are, variations, of, the, local, pressure, and, particle, motion, that, propagate, through, the, medium, other, examples, of, mechanical, waves, are, seismic, waves, gravity, waves, surface, waves, and, string, vibrations, in, an, electromagnetic, wave, such, as, light, coupling, between, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, sustains, propagation, of, waves, involving, these, fields, according, to, maxwell, s, equations, electromagnetic, waves, can, travel, through, a, vacuum, and, through, some, dielectric, media, at, wavelengths, where, they, are, considered, transparent, electromagnetic, waves, as, determined, by, their, frequencies, or, wavelengths, have, more, specific, designations, including, radio, waves, infrared, radiation, terahertz, waves, visible, light, ultraviolet, radiation, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, other, types, of, waves, include, gravitational, waves, which, are, disturbances, in, spacetime, that, propagate, according, to, general, relativity, heat, diffusion, waves, plasma, waves, that, combine, mechanical, deformations, and, electromagnetic, fields, reaction, diffusion, waves, such, as, in, the, belousov, zhabotinsky, reaction, and, many, more, mechanical, and, electromagnetic, waves, transfer, energy, momentum, and, information, but, they, do, not, transfer, particles, in, the, medium, in, mathematics, and, electronics, waves, are, studied, as, signals, on, the, other, hand, some, waves, have, envelopes, which, do, not, move, at, all, such, as, standing, waves, which, are, fundamental, to, music, and, hydraulic, jumps, a, physical, wave, field, is, almost, always, confined, to, some, finite, region, of, space, called, its, domain, for, example, the, seismic, waves, generated, by, earthquakes, are, significant, only, in, the, interior, and, surface, of, the, planet, so, they, can, be, ignored, outside, it, however, waves, with, infinite, domain, that, extend, over, the, whole, space, are, commonly, studied, in, mathematics, and, are, very, valuable, tools, for, understanding, physical, waves, in, finite, domains, a, plane, wave, is, an, important, mathematical, idealization, where, the, disturbance, is, identical, along, any, infinite, plane, normal, to, a, specific, direction, of, travel, mathematically, the, simplest, wave, is, a, sinusoidal, plane, wave, in, which, at, any, point, the, field, experiences, simple, harmonic, motion, at, one, frequency, in, linear, media, complicated, waves, can, generally, be, decomposed, as, the, sum, of, many, sinusoidal, plane, waves, having, different, directions, of, propagation, and, or, different, frequencies, a, plane, wave, is, classified, as, a, transverse, wave, if, the, field, disturbance, at, each, point, is, described, by, a, vector, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, propagation, also, the, direction, of, energy, transfer, or, longitudinal, wave, if, those, vectors, are, aligned, with, the, propagation, direction, mechanical, waves, include, both, transverse, and, longitudinal, waves, on, the, other, hand, electromagnetic, plane, waves, are, strictly, transverse, while, sound, waves, in, fluids, such, as, air, can, only, be, longitudinal, that, physical, direction, of, an, oscillating, field, relative, to, the, propagation, direction, is, also, referred, to, as, the, wave, s, polarization, which, can, be, an, important, attribute, a, wave, can, be, described, just, like, a, field, namely, as, a, function, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, where, x, displaystyle, x, is, a, position, and, t, displaystyle, t, is, a, time, the, value, of, x, displaystyle, x, is, a, point, of, space, specifically, in, the, region, where, the, wave, is, defined, in, mathematical, terms, it, is, usually, a, vector, in, the, cartesian, three, dimensional, space, r, 3, displaystyle, mathbb, r, 3, however, in, many, cases, one, can, ignore, one, dimension, and, let, x, displaystyle, x, be, a, point, of, the, cartesian, plane, r, 2, displaystyle, mathbb, r, 2, this, is, the, case, for, example, when, studying, vibrations, of, a, drum, skin, one, may, even, restrict, x, displaystyle, x, to, a, point, of, the, cartesian, line, r, displaystyle, mathbb, r, that, is, the, set, of, real, numbers, this, is, the, case, for, example, when, studying, vibrations, in, a, violin, string, or, recorder, the, time, t, displaystyle, t, on, the, other, hand, is, always, assumed, to, be, a, scalar, that, is, a, real, number, the, value, of, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, can, be, any, physical, quantity, of, interest, assigned, to, the, point, x, displaystyle, x, that, may, vary, with, time, for, example, if, f, displaystyle, f, represents, the, vibrations, inside, an, elastic, solid, the, value, of, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, is, usually, a, vector, that, gives, the, current, displacement, from, x, displaystyle, x, of, the, material, particles, that, would, be, at, the, point, x, displaystyle, x, in, the, absence, of, vibration, for, an, electromagnetic, wave, the, value, of, f, displaystyle, f, can, be, the, electric, field, vector, e, displaystyle, e, or, the, magnetic, field, vector, h, displaystyle, h, or, any, related, quantity, such, as, the, poynting, vector, e, h, displaystyle, e, times, h, in, fluid, dynamics, the, value, of, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, could, be, the, velocity, vector, of, the, fluid, at, the, point, x, displaystyle, x, or, any, scalar, property, like, pressure, temperature, or, density, in, a, chemical, reaction, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, could, be, the, concentration, of, some, substance, in, the, neighborhood, of, point, x, displaystyle, x, of, the, reaction, medium, for, any, dimension, d, displaystyle, d, 1, 2, or, 3, the, wave, s, domain, is, then, a, subset, d, displaystyle, d, of, r, d, displaystyle, mathbb, r, d, such, that, the, function, value, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, is, defined, for, any, point, x, displaystyle, x, in, d, displaystyle, d, for, example, when, describing, the, motion, of, a, drum, skin, one, can, consider, d, displaystyle, d, to, be, a, disk, circle, on, the, plane, r, 2, displaystyle, mathbb, r, 2, with, center, at, the, origin, 0, 0, displaystyle, 0, 0, and, let, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, be, the, vertical, displacement, of, the, skin, at, the, point, x, displaystyle, x, of, d, displaystyle, d, and, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, waves, of, the, same, type, are, often, superposed, and, encountered, simultaneously, at, a, given, point, in, space, and, time, the, properties, at, that, point, are, the, sum, of, the, properties, of, each, component, wave, at, that, point, in, general, the, velocities, are, not, the, same, so, the, wave, form, will, change, over, time, and, space, sometimes, one, is, interested, in, a, single, specific, wave, more, often, however, one, needs, to, understand, large, set, of, possible, waves, like, all, the, ways, that, a, drum, skin, can, vibrate, after, being, struck, once, with, a, drum, stick, or, all, the, possible, radar, echos, one, could, get, from, an, airplane, that, may, be, approaching, an, airport, in, some, of, those, situations, one, may, describe, such, a, family, of, waves, by, a, function, f, a, b, x, t, displaystyle, f, a, b, ldots, x, t, that, depends, on, certain, parameters, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, ldots, besides, x, displaystyle, x, and, t, displaystyle, t, then, one, can, obtain, different, waves, that, is, different, functions, of, x, displaystyle, x, and, t, displaystyle, t, by, choosing, different, values, for, those, parameters, for, example, the, sound, pressure, inside, a, recorder, that, is, playing, a, pure, note, is, typically, a, standing, wave, that, can, be, written, as, the, parameter, a, displaystyle, a, defines, the, amplitude, of, the, wave, that, is, the, maximum, sound, pressure, in, the, bore, which, is, related, to, the, loudness, of, the, note, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, sound, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, length, of, the, bore, and, n, displaystyle, n, is, a, positive, integer, 1, 2, 3, that, specifies, the, number, of, nodes, in, the, standing, wave, the, position, x, displaystyle, x, should, be, measured, from, the, mouthpiece, and, the, time, t, displaystyle, t, from, any, moment, at, which, the, pressure, at, the, mouthpiece, is, maximum, the, quantity, 4, l, 2, n, 1, displaystyle, lambda, 4l, 2n, 1, is, the, wavelength, of, the, emitted, note, and, f, c, displaystyle, f, c, lambda, is, its, frequency, many, general, properties, of, these, waves, can, be, inferred, from, this, general, equation, without, choosing, specific, values, for, the, parameters, as, another, example, it, may, be, that, the, vibrations, of, a, drum, skin, after, a, single, strike, depend, only, on, the, distance, r, displaystyle, r, from, the, center, of, the, skin, to, the, strike, point, and, on, the, strength, s, displaystyle, s, of, the, strike, then, the, vibration, for, all, possible, strikes, can, be, described, by, a, function, f, r, s, x, t, displaystyle, f, r, s, x, t, sometimes, the, family, of, waves, of, interest, has, infinitely, many, parameters, for, example, one, may, want, to, describe, what, happens, to, the, temperature, in, a, metal, bar, when, it, is, initially, heated, at, various, temperatures, at, different, points, along, its, length, and, then, allowed, to, cool, by, itself, in, vacuum, in, that, case, instead, of, a, scalar, or, vector, the, parameter, would, have, to, be, a, function, h, displaystyle, h, such, that, h, x, displaystyle, h, x, is, the, initial, temperature, at, each, point, x, displaystyle, x, of, the, bar, then, the, temperatures, at, later, times, can, be, expressed, by, a, function, f, displaystyle, f, that, depends, on, the, function, h, displaystyle, h, that, is, a, functional, operator, so, that, the, temperature, at, a, later, time, is, f, h, x, t, displaystyle, f, h, x, t, another, way, to, describe, and, study, a, family, of, waves, is, to, give, a, mathematical, equation, that, instead, of, explicitly, giving, the, value, of, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, only, constrains, how, those, values, can, change, with, time, then, the, family, of, waves, in, question, consists, of, all, functions, f, displaystyle, f, that, satisfy, those, constraints, that, is, all, solutions, of, the, equation, this, approach, is, extremely, important, in, physics, because, the, constraints, usually, are, a, consequence, of, the, physical, processes, that, cause, the, wave, to, evolve, for, example, if, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, is, the, temperature, inside, a, block, of, some, homogeneous, and, isotropic, solid, material, its, evolution, is, constrained, by, the, partial, differential, equation, where, q, p, f, displaystyle, q, p, f, is, the, heat, that, is, being, generated, per, unit, of, volume, and, time, in, the, neighborhood, of, x, displaystyle, x, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, for, example, by, chemical, reactions, happening, there, x, 1, x, 2, x, 3, displaystyle, x, 1, x, 2, x, 3, are, the, cartesian, coordinates, of, the, point, x, displaystyle, x, f, t, displaystyle, partial, f, partial, t, is, the, first, derivative, of, f, displaystyle, f, with, respect, to, t, displaystyle, t, and, 2, f, x, i, 2, displaystyle, partial, 2, f, partial, x, i, 2, is, the, second, derivative, of, f, displaystyle, f, relative, to, x, i, displaystyle, x, i, the, symbol, displaystyle, partial, is, meant, to, signify, that, in, the, derivative, with, respect, to, some, variable, all, other, variables, must, be, considered, fixed, this, equation, can, be, derived, from, the, laws, of, physics, that, govern, the, diffusion, of, heat, in, solid, media, for, that, reason, it, is, called, the, heat, equation, in, mathematics, even, though, it, applies, to, many, other, physical, quantities, besides, temperatures, for, another, example, we, can, describe, all, possible, sounds, echoing, within, a, container, of, gas, by, a, function, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, x, t, that, gives, the, pressure, at, a, point, x, displaystyle, x, and, time, t, displaystyle, t, within, that, container, if, the, gas, was, initially, at, uniform, temperature, and, composition, the, evolution, of, f, displaystyle, f, is, constrained, by, the, formula, here, p, x, t, displaystyle, p, x, t, is, some, extra, compression, force, that, is, being, applied, to, the, gas, near, x, displaystyle, x, by, some, external, process, such, as, a, loudspeaker, or, piston, right, next, to, p, displaystyle, p, this, same, differential, equation, describes, the, behavior, of, mechanical, vibrations, and, electromagnetic, fields, in, a, homogeneous, isotropic, non, conducting, solid, note, that, this, equation, differs, from, that, of, heat, flow, only, in, that, the, left, hand, side, is, 2, f, t, 2, displaystyle, partial, 2, f, partial, t, 2, the, second, derivative, of, f, displaystyle, f, with, respect, to, time, rather, than, the, first, derivative, f, t, displaystyle, partial, f, partial, t, yet, this, small, change, makes, a, huge, difference, on, the, set, of, solutions, f, displaystyle, f, this, differential, equation, is, called, the, wave, equation, in, mathematics, even, though, it, describes, only, one, very, special, kind, of, waves, consider, a, traveling, transverse, wave, which, may, be, a, pulse, on, a, string, the, medium, consider, the, string, to, have, a, single, spatial, dimension, consider, this, wave, as, traveling, this, wave, can, then, be, described, by, the, two, dimensional, functions, or, more, generally, by, d, alembert, s, formula, u, x, t, f, x, v, t, g, x, v, t, displaystyle, u, x, t, f, x, vt, g, x, vt, representing, two, component, waveforms, f, displaystyle, f, and, g, displaystyle, g, traveling, through, the, medium, in, opposite, directions, a, generalized, representation, of, this, wave, can, be, obtained, as, the, partial, differential, equation, 1, v, 2, 2, u, t, 2, 2, u, x, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, v, 2, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, t, 2, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, x, 2, general, solutions, are, based, upon, duhamel, s, principle, the, form, or, shape, of, f, in, d, alembert, s, formula, involves, the, argument, x, vt, constant, values, of, this, argument, correspond, to, constant, values, of, f, and, these, constant, values, occur, if, x, increases, at, the, same, rate, that, vt, increases, that, is, the, wave, shaped, like, the, function, f, will, move, in, the, positive, x, direction, at, velocity, v, and, g, will, propagate, at, the, same, speed, in, the, negative, x, direction, in, the, case, of, a, periodic, function, f, with, period, that, is, f, x, vt, f, x, vt, the, periodicity, of, f, in, space, means, that, a, snapshot, of, the, wave, at, a, given, time, t, finds, the, wave, varying, periodically, in, space, with, period, the, wavelength, of, the, wave, in, a, similar, fashion, this, periodicity, of, f, implies, a, periodicity, in, time, as, well, f, x, v, t, t, f, x, vt, provided, vt, so, an, observation, of, the, wave, at, a, fixed, location, x, finds, the, wave, undulating, periodically, in, time, with, period, t, v, the, amplitude, of, a, wave, may, be, constant, in, which, case, the, wave, is, a, c, w, or, continuous, wave, or, may, be, modulated, so, as, to, vary, with, time, and, or, position, the, outline, of, the, variation, in, amplitude, is, called, the, envelope, of, the, wave, mathematically, the, modulated, wave, can, be, written, in, the, form, u, x, t, a, x, t, sin, k, x, t, displaystyle, u, x, t, a, x, t, sin, left, kx, omega, t, phi, right, where, a, x, t, displaystyle, a, x, t, is, the, amplitude, envelope, of, the, wave, k, displaystyle, k, is, the, wavenumber, and, displaystyle, phi, is, the, phase, if, the, group, velocity, v, g, displaystyle, v, g, see, below, is, wavelength, independent, this, equation, can, be, simplified, as, u, x, t, a, x, v, g, t, sin, k, x, t, displaystyle, u, x, t, a, x, v, g, t, sin, left, kx, omega, t, phi, right, showing, that, the, envelope, moves, with, the, group, velocity, and, retains, its, shape, otherwise, in, cases, where, the, group, velocity, varies, with, wavelength, the, pulse, shape, changes, in, a, manner, often, described, using, an, envelope, equation, there, are, two, velocities, that, are, associated, with, waves, the, phase, velocity, and, the, group, velocity, phase, velocity, is, the, rate, at, which, the, phase, of, the, wave, propagates, in, space, any, given, phase, of, the, wave, for, example, the, crest, will, appear, to, travel, at, the, phase, velocity, the, phase, velocity, is, given, in, terms, of, the, wavelength, lambda, and, period, t, as, v, p, t, displaystyle, v, mathrm, p, frac, lambda, t, group, velocity, is, a, property, of, waves, that, have, a, defined, envelope, measuring, propagation, through, space, that, is, phase, velocity, of, the, overall, shape, of, the, waves, amplitudes, modulation, or, envelope, of, the, wave, a, sine, wave, sinusoidal, wave, or, sinusoid, symbol, is, a, periodic, wave, whose, waveform, shape, is, the, trigonometric, sine, function, in, mechanics, as, a, linear, motion, over, time, this, is, simple, harmonic, motion, as, rotation, it, corresponds, to, uniform, circular, motion, sine, waves, occur, often, in, physics, including, wind, waves, sound, waves, and, light, waves, such, as, monochromatic, radiation, in, engineering, signal, processing, and, mathematics, fourier, analysis, decomposes, general, functions, into, a, sum, of, sine, waves, of, various, frequencies, relative, phases, and, magnitudes, a, plane, wave, is, a, kind, of, wave, whose, value, varies, only, in, one, spatial, direction, that, is, its, value, is, constant, on, a, plane, that, is, perpendicular, to, that, direction, plane, waves, can, be, specified, by, a, vector, of, unit, length, n, displaystyle, hat, n, indicating, the, direction, that, the, wave, varies, in, and, a, wave, profile, describing, how, the, wave, varies, as, a, function, of, the, displacement, along, that, direction, n, x, displaystyle, hat, n, cdot, vec, x, and, time, t, displaystyle, t, since, the, wave, profile, only, depends, on, the, position, x, displaystyle, vec, x, in, the, combination, n, x, displaystyle, hat, n, cdot, vec, x, any, displacement, in, directions, perpendicular, to, n, displaystyle, hat, n, cannot, affect, the, value, of, the, field, plane, waves, are, often, used, to, model, electromagnetic, waves, far, from, a, source, for, electromagnetic, plane, waves, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, themselves, are, transverse, to, the, direction, of, propagation, and, also, perpendicular, to, each, other, a, standing, wave, also, known, as, a, stationary, wave, is, a, wave, whose, envelope, remains, in, a, constant, position, this, phenomenon, arises, as, a, result, of, interference, between, two, waves, traveling, in, opposite, directions, the, sum, of, two, counter, propagating, waves, of, equal, amplitude, and, frequency, creates, a, standing, wave, standing, waves, commonly, arise, when, a, boundary, blocks, further, propagation, of, the, wave, thus, causing, wave, reflection, and, therefore, introducing, a, counter, propagating, wave, for, example, when, a, violin, string, is, displaced, transverse, waves, propagate, out, to, where, the, string, is, held, in, place, at, the, bridge, and, the, nut, where, the, waves, are, reflected, back, at, the, bridge, and, nut, the, two, opposed, waves, are, in, antiphase, and, cancel, each, other, producing, a, node, halfway, between, two, nodes, there, is, an, antinode, where, the, two, counter, propagating, waves, enhance, each, other, maximally, there, is, no, net, propagation, of, energy, over, time, a, soliton, or, solitary, wave, is, a, self, reinforcing, wave, packet, that, maintains, its, shape, while, it, propagates, at, a, constant, velocity, solitons, are, caused, by, a, cancellation, of, nonlinear, and, dispersive, effects, in, the, medium, dispersive, effects, are, a, property, of, certain, systems, where, the, speed, of, a, wave, depends, on, its, frequency, solitons, are, the, solutions, of, a, widespread, class, of, weakly, nonlinear, dispersive, partial, differential, equations, describing, physical, systems, wave, propagation, is, any, of, the, ways, in, which, waves, travel, with, respect, to, the, direction, of, the, oscillation, relative, to, the, propagation, direction, we, can, distinguish, between, longitudinal, wave, and, transverse, waves, electromagnetic, waves, propagate, in, vacuum, as, well, as, in, material, media, propagation, of, other, wave, types, such, as, sound, may, occur, only, in, a, transmission, medium, the, propagation, and, reflection, of, plane, waves, e, g, pressure, waves, p, wave, or, shear, waves, sh, or, sv, waves, are, phenomena, that, were, first, characterized, within, the, field, of, classical, seismology, and, are, now, considered, fundamental, concepts, in, modern, seismic, tomography, the, analytical, solution, to, this, problem, exists, and, is, well, known, the, frequency, domain, solution, can, be, obtained, by, first, finding, the, helmholtz, decomposition, of, the, displacement, field, which, is, then, substituted, into, the, wave, equation, from, here, the, plane, wave, eigenmodes, can, be, calculated, the, analytical, solution, of, sv, wave, in, a, half, space, indicates, that, the, plane, sv, wave, reflects, back, to, the, domain, as, a, p, and, sv, waves, leaving, out, special, cases, the, angle, of, the, reflected, sv, wave, is, identical, to, the, incidence, wave, while, the, angle, of, the, reflected, p, wave, is, greater, than, the, sv, wave, for, the, same, wave, frequency, the, sv, wavelength, is, smaller, than, the, p, wavelength, this, fact, has, been, depicted, in, this, animated, picture, similar, to, the, sv, wave, the, p, incidence, in, general, reflects, as, the, p, and, sv, wave, there, are, some, special, cases, where, the, regime, is, different, wave, velocity, is, a, general, concept, of, various, kinds, of, wave, velocities, for, a, wave, s, phase, and, speed, concerning, energy, and, information, propagation, the, phase, velocity, is, given, as, v, p, k, displaystyle, v, rm, p, frac, omega, k, where, the, phase, speed, gives, you, the, speed, at, which, a, point, of, constant, phase, of, the, wave, will, travel, for, a, discrete, frequency, the, angular, frequency, cannot, be, chosen, independently, from, the, wavenumber, k, but, both, are, related, through, the, dispersion, relationship, k, displaystyle, omega, omega, k, in, the, special, case, k, ck, with, c, a, constant, the, waves, are, called, non, dispersive, since, all, frequencies, travel, at, the, same, phase, speed, c, for, instance, electromagnetic, waves, in, vacuum, are, non, dispersive, in, case, of, other, forms, of, the, dispersion, relation, we, have, dispersive, waves, the, dispersion, relationship, depends, on, the, medium, through, which, the, waves, propagate, and, on, the, type, of, waves, for, instance, electromagnetic, sound, or, water, waves, the, speed, at, which, a, resultant, wave, packet, from, a, narrow, range, of, frequencies, will, travel, is, called, the, group, velocity, and, is, determined, from, the, gradient, of, the, dispersion, relation, v, g, k, displaystyle, v, rm, g, frac, partial, omega, partial, k, in, almost, all, cases, a, wave, is, mainly, a, movement, of, energy, through, a, medium, most, often, the, group, velocity, is, the, velocity, at, which, the, energy, moves, through, this, medium, waves, exhibit, common, behaviors, under, a, number, of, standard, situations, for, example, waves, normally, move, in, a, straight, line, that, is, rectilinearly, through, a, transmission, medium, such, media, can, be, classified, into, one, or, more, of, the, following, categories, waves, are, usually, defined, in, media, which, allow, most, or, all, of, a, wave, s, energy, to, propagate, without, loss, however, materials, may, be, characterized, as, lossy, if, they, remove, energy, from, a, wave, usually, converting, it, into, heat, this, is, termed, absorption, a, material, which, absorbs, a, wave, s, energy, either, in, transmission, or, reflection, is, characterized, by, a, refractive, index, which, is, complex, the, amount, of, absorption, will, generally, depend, on, the, frequency, wavelength, of, the, wave, which, for, instance, explains, why, objects, may, appear, colored, when, a, wave, strikes, a, reflective, surface, it, changes, direction, such, that, the, angle, made, by, the, incident, wave, and, line, normal, to, the, surface, equals, the, angle, made, by, the, reflected, wave, and, the, same, normal, line, refraction, is, the, phenomenon, of, a, wave, changing, its, speed, mathematically, this, means, that, the, size, of, the, phase, velocity, changes, typically, refraction, occurs, when, a, wave, passes, from, one, medium, into, another, the, amount, by, which, a, wave, is, refracted, by, a, material, is, given, by, the, refractive, index, of, the, material, the, directions, of, incidence, and, refraction, are, related, to, the, refractive, indices, of, the, two, materials, by, snell, s, law, a, wave, exhibits, diffraction, when, it, encounters, an, obstacle, that, bends, the, wave, or, when, it, spreads, after, emerging, from, an, opening, diffraction, effects, are, more, pronounced, when, the, size, of, the, obstacle, or, opening, is, comparable, to, the, wavelength, of, the, wave, when, waves, in, a, linear, medium, the, usual, case, cross, each, other, in, a, region, of, space, they, do, not, actually, interact, with, each, other, but, continue, on, as, if, the, other, one, were, not, present, however, at, any, point, in, that, region, the, field, quantities, describing, those, waves, add, according, to, the, superposition, principle, if, the, waves, are, of, the, same, frequency, in, a, fixed, phase, relationship, then, there, will, generally, be, positions, at, which, the, two, waves, are, in, phase, and, their, amplitudes, add, and, other, positions, where, they, are, out, of, phase, and, their, amplitudes, partially, or, fully, cancel, this, is, called, an, interference, pattern, the, phenomenon, of, polarization, arises, when, wave, motion, can, occur, simultaneously, in, two, orthogonal, directions, transverse, waves, can, be, polarized, for, instance, when, polarization, is, used, as, a, descriptor, without, qualification, it, usually, refers, to, the, special, simple, case, of, linear, polarization, a, transverse, wave, is, linearly, polarized, if, it, oscillates, in, only, one, direction, or, plane, in, the, case, of, linear, polarization, it, is, often, useful, to, add, the, relative, orientation, of, that, plane, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, travel, in, which, the, oscillation, occurs, such, as, horizontal, for, instance, if, the, plane, of, polarization, is, parallel, to, the, ground, electromagnetic, waves, propagating, in, free, space, for, instance, are, transverse, they, can, be, polarized, by, the, use, of, a, polarizing, filter, longitudinal, waves, such, as, sound, waves, do, not, exhibit, polarization, for, these, waves, there, is, only, one, direction, of, oscillation, that, is, along, the, direction, of, travel, a, wave, undergoes, dispersion, when, either, the, phase, velocity, or, the, group, velocity, depends, on, the, wave, frequency, dispersion, is, most, easily, seen, by, letting, white, light, pass, through, a, prism, the, result, of, which, is, to, produce, the, spectrum, of, colors, of, the, rainbow, isaac, newton, performed, experiments, with, light, and, prisms, presenting, his, findings, in, the, opticks, 1704, that, white, light, consists, of, several, colors, and, that, these, colors, cannot, be, decomposed, any, further, the, doppler, effect, or, doppler, shift, is, the, change, in, frequency, of, a, wave, in, relation, to, an, observer, who, is, moving, relative, to, the, wave, source, it, is, named, after, the, austrian, physicist, christian, doppler, who, described, the, phenomenon, in, 1842, a, mechanical, wave, is, an, oscillation, of, matter, and, therefore, transfers, energy, through, a, medium, while, waves, can, move, over, long, distances, the, movement, of, the, medium, of, transmission, the, material, is, limited, therefore, the, oscillating, material, does, not, move, far, from, its, initial, position, mechanical, waves, can, be, produced, only, in, media, which, possess, elasticity, and, inertia, there, are, three, types, of, mechanical, waves, transverse, waves, longitudinal, waves, and, surface, waves, the, transverse, vibration, of, a, string, is, a, function, of, tension, and, inertia, and, is, constrained, by, the, length, of, the, string, as, the, ends, are, fixed, this, constraint, limits, the, steady, state, modes, that, are, possible, and, thereby, the, frequencies, the, speed, of, a, transverse, wave, traveling, along, a, vibrating, string, v, is, directly, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, tension, of, the, string, t, over, the, linear, mass, density, where, the, linear, density, is, the, mass, per, unit, length, of, the, string, acoustic, or, sound, waves, are, compression, waves, which, travel, as, body, waves, at, the, speed, given, by, or, the, square, root, of, the, adiabatic, bulk, modulus, divided, by, the, ambient, density, of, the, medium, see, speed, of, sound, body, waves, travel, through, the, interior, of, the, medium, along, paths, controlled, by, the, material, properties, in, terms, of, density, and, modulus, stiffness, the, density, and, modulus, in, turn, vary, according, to, temperature, composition, and, material, phase, this, effect, resembles, the, refraction, of, light, waves, two, types, of, particle, motion, result, in, two, types, of, body, waves, primary, and, secondary, waves, seismic, waves, are, waves, of, energy, that, travel, through, the, earth, s, layers, and, are, a, result, of, earthquakes, volcanic, eruptions, magma, movement, large, landslides, and, large, man, made, explosions, that, give, out, low, frequency, acoustic, energy, they, include, body, waves, the, primary, p, waves, and, secondary, waves, s, waves, and, surface, waves, such, as, rayleigh, waves, love, waves, and, stoneley, waves, a, shock, wave, is, a, type, of, propagating, disturbance, when, a, wave, moves, faster, than, the, local, speed, of, sound, in, a, fluid, it, is, a, shock, wave, like, an, ordinary, wave, a, shock, wave, carries, energy, and, can, propagate, through, a, medium, however, it, is, characterized, by, an, abrupt, nearly, discontinuous, change, in, pressure, temperature, and, density, of, the, medium, shear, waves, are, body, waves, due, to, shear, rigidity, and, inertia, they, can, only, be, transmitted, through, solids, and, to, a, lesser, extent, through, liquids, with, a, sufficiently, high, viscosity, an, electromagnetic, wave, consists, of, two, waves, that, are, oscillations, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, an, electromagnetic, wave, travels, in, a, direction, that, is, at, right, angles, to, the, oscillation, direction, of, both, fields, in, the, 19th, century, james, clerk, maxwell, showed, that, in, vacuum, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, satisfy, the, wave, equation, both, with, speed, equal, to, that, of, the, speed, of, light, from, this, emerged, the, idea, that, light, is, an, electromagnetic, wave, the, unification, of, light, and, electromagnetic, waves, was, experimentally, confirmed, by, hertz, in, the, end, of, the, 1880s, electromagnetic, waves, can, have, different, frequencies, and, thus, wavelengths, and, are, classified, accordingly, in, wavebands, such, as, radio, waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, the, range, of, frequencies, in, each, of, these, bands, is, continuous, and, the, limits, of, each, band, are, mostly, arbitrary, with, the, exception, of, visible, light, which, must, be, visible, to, the, normal, human, eye, the, schr, dinger, equation, describes, the, wave, like, behavior, of, particles, in, quantum, mechanics, solutions, of, this, equation, are, wave, functions, which, can, be, used, to, describe, the, probability, density, of, a, particle, the, dirac, equation, is, a, relativistic, wave, equation, detailing, electromagnetic, interactions, dirac, waves, accounted, for, the, fine, details, of, the, hydrogen, spectrum, in, a, completely, rigorous, way, the, wave, equation, also, implied, the, existence, of, a, new, form, of, matter, antimatter, previously, unsuspected, and, unobserved, and, which, was, experimentally, confirmed, in, the, context, of, quantum, field, theory, the, dirac, equation, is, reinterpreted, to, describe, quantum, fields, corresponding, to, spin, 1, 2, particles, louis, de, broglie, postulated, that, all, particles, with, momentum, have, a, wavelength, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, p, is, the, magnitude, of, the, momentum, of, the, particle, this, hypothesis, was, at, the, basis, of, quantum, mechanics, nowadays, this, wavelength, is, called, the, de, broglie, wavelength, for, example, the, electrons, in, a, crt, display, have, a, de, broglie, wavelength, of, about, 10, 13, m, a, wave, representing, such, a, particle, traveling, in, the, k, direction, is, expressed, by, the, wave, function, as, follows, where, the, wavelength, is, determined, by, the, wave, vector, k, as, and, the, momentum, by, however, a, wave, like, this, with, definite, wavelength, is, not, localized, in, space, and, so, cannot, represent, a, particle, localized, in, space, to, localize, a, particle, de, broglie, proposed, a, superposition, of, different, wavelengths, ranging, around, a, central, value, in, a, wave, packet, a, waveform, often, used, in, quantum, mechanics, to, describe, the, wave, function, of, a, particle, in, a, wave, packet, the, wavelength, of, the, particle, is, not, precise, and, the, local, wavelength, deviates, on, either, side, of, the, main, wavelength, value, in, representing, the, wave, function, of, a, localized, particle, the, wave, packet, is, often, taken, to, have, a, gaussian, shape, and, is, called, a, gaussian, wave, packet, gaussian, wave, packets, also, are, used, to, analyze, water, waves, for, example, a, gaussian, wavefunction, might, take, the, form, at, some, initial, time, t, 0, where, the, central, wavelength, is, related, to, the, central, wave, vector, k, 0, as, 0, 2, k, 0, it, is, well, known, from, the, theory, of, fourier, analysis, or, from, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, in, the, case, of, quantum, mechanics, that, a, narrow, range, of, wavelengths, is, necessary, to, produce, a, localized, wave, packet, and, the, more, localized, the, envelope, the, larger, the, spread, in, required, wavelengths, the, fourier, transform, of, a, gaussian, is, itself, a, gaussian, given, the, gaussian, the, fourier, transform, is, the, gaussian, in, space, therefore, is, made, up, of, waves, that, is, a, number, of, waves, of, wavelengths, such, that, k, 2, the, parameter, decides, the, spatial, spread, of, the, gaussian, along, the, x, axis, while, the, fourier, transform, shows, a, spread, in, wave, vector, k, determined, by, 1, that, is, the, smaller, the, extent, in, space, the, larger, the, extent, in, k, and, hence, in, 2, k, gravity, waves, are, waves, generated, in, a, fluid, medium, or, at, the, interface, between, two, media, when, the, force, of, gravity, or, buoyancy, works, to, restore, equilibrium, surface, waves, on, water, are, the, most, familiar, example, gravitational, waves, also, travel, through, space, the, first, observation, of, gravitational, waves, was, announced, on, 11, february, 2016, gravitational, waves, are, disturbances, in, the, curvature, of, spacetime, predicted, by, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity
