a, meteor, shower, is, a, celestial, event, in, which, a, number, of, meteors, are, observed, to, radiate, or, originate, from, one, point, in, the, night, sky, these, meteors, are, caused, by, streams, of, cosmic, debris, called, meteoroids, entering, earth, s, atmosphere, at, extremely, high, speeds, on, parallel, trajectories, most, meteors, are, smaller, than, a, grain, of, sand, so, almost, all, of, them, disintegrate, and, never, hit, the, earth, s, surface, very, intense, or, unusual, meteor, showers, are, known, as, meteor, outbursts, and, meteor, storms, which, produce, at, least, 1, 000, meteors, an, hour, most, notably, from, the, leonids, the, meteor, data, centre, lists, over, 900, suspected, meteor, showers, of, which, about, 100, are, well, established, several, organizations, point, to, viewing, opportunities, on, the, internet, nasa, maintains, a, daily, map, of, active, meteor, showers, a, meteor, shower, in, august, 1583, was, recorded, in, the, timbuktu, manuscripts, in, the, modern, era, the, first, great, meteor, storm, was, the, leonids, of, november, 1833, one, estimate, is, a, peak, rate, of, over, one, hundred, thousand, meteors, an, hour, but, another, done, as, the, storm, abated, estimated, more, than, two, hundred, thousand, meteors, during, the, 9, hours, of, the, storm, over, the, entire, region, of, north, america, east, of, the, rocky, mountains, american, denison, olmsted, 1791, 1859, explained, the, event, most, accurately, after, spending, the, last, weeks, of, 1833, collecting, information, he, presented, his, findings, in, january, 1834, to, the, american, journal, of, science, and, arts, published, in, january, april, 1834, and, january, 1836, he, noted, the, shower, was, of, short, duration, and, was, not, seen, in, europe, and, that, the, meteors, radiated, from, a, point, in, the, constellation, of, leo, he, speculated, the, meteors, had, originated, from, a, cloud, of, particles, in, space, work, continued, yet, coming, to, understand, the, annual, nature, of, showers, though, the, occurrences, of, storms, perplexed, researchers, the, actual, nature, of, meteors, was, still, debated, during, the, 19th, century, meteors, were, conceived, as, an, atmospheric, phenomenon, by, many, scientists, alexander, von, humboldt, adolphe, quetelet, julius, schmidt, until, the, italian, astronomer, giovanni, schiaparelli, ascertained, the, relation, between, meteors, and, comets, in, his, work, notes, upon, the, astronomical, theory, of, the, falling, stars, 1867, in, the, 1890s, irish, astronomer, george, johnstone, stoney, 1826, 1911, and, british, astronomer, arthur, matthew, weld, downing, 1850, 1917, were, the, first, to, attempt, to, calculate, the, position, of, the, dust, at, earth, s, orbit, they, studied, the, dust, ejected, in, 1866, by, comet, 55p, tempel, tuttle, before, the, anticipated, leonid, shower, return, of, 1898, and, 1899, meteor, storms, were, expected, but, the, final, calculations, showed, that, most, of, the, dust, would, be, far, inside, earth, s, orbit, the, same, results, were, independently, arrived, at, by, adolf, berberich, of, the, k, nigliches, astronomisches, rechen, institut, royal, astronomical, computation, institute, in, berlin, germany, although, the, absence, of, meteor, storms, that, season, confirmed, the, calculations, the, advance, of, much, better, computing, tools, was, needed, to, arrive, at, reliable, predictions, in, 1981, donald, k, yeomans, of, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, reviewed, the, history, of, meteor, showers, for, the, leonids, and, the, history, of, the, dynamic, orbit, of, comet, tempel, tuttle, a, graph, from, it, was, adapted, and, re, published, in, sky, and, telescope, it, showed, relative, positions, of, the, earth, and, tempel, tuttle, and, marks, where, earth, encountered, dense, dust, this, showed, that, the, meteoroids, are, mostly, behind, and, outside, the, path, of, the, comet, but, paths, of, the, earth, through, the, cloud, of, particles, resulting, in, powerful, storms, were, very, near, paths, of, nearly, no, activity, in, 1985, e, d, kondrat, eva, and, e, a, reznikov, of, kazan, state, university, first, correctly, identified, the, years, when, dust, was, released, which, was, responsible, for, several, past, leonid, meteor, storms, in, 1995, peter, jenniskens, predicted, the, 1995, alpha, monocerotids, outburst, from, dust, trails, in, anticipation, of, the, 1999, leonid, storm, robert, h, mcnaught, david, asher, and, finland, s, esko, lyytinen, were, the, first, to, apply, this, method, in, the, west, in, 2006, jenniskens, published, predictions, for, future, dust, trail, encounters, covering, the, next, 50, years, j, r, mie, vaubaillon, continues, to, update, predictions, based, on, observations, each, year, for, the, institut, de, m, canique, c, leste, et, de, calcul, des, ph, m, rides, imcce, because, meteor, shower, particles, are, all, traveling, in, parallel, paths, and, at, the, same, velocity, they, will, appear, to, an, observer, below, to, radiate, away, from, a, single, point, in, the, sky, this, radiant, point, is, caused, by, the, effect, of, perspective, similar, to, parallel, railroad, tracks, converging, at, a, single, vanishing, point, on, the, horizon, meteor, showers, are, normally, named, after, the, constellation, from, which, the, meteors, appear, to, originate, this, fixed, point, slowly, moves, across, the, sky, during, the, night, due, to, the, earth, turning, on, its, axis, the, same, reason, the, stars, appear, to, slowly, march, across, the, sky, the, radiant, also, moves, slightly, from, night, to, night, against, the, background, stars, radiant, drift, due, to, the, earth, moving, in, its, orbit, around, the, sun, see, imo, meteor, shower, calendar, 2017, international, meteor, organization, for, maps, of, drifting, fixed, points, when, the, moving, radiant, is, at, the, highest, point, it, will, reach, the, observer, s, sky, that, night, the, sun, will, be, just, clearing, the, eastern, horizon, for, this, reason, the, best, viewing, time, for, a, meteor, shower, is, generally, slightly, before, dawn, a, compromise, between, the, maximum, number, of, meteors, available, for, viewing, and, the, brightening, sky, which, makes, them, harder, to, see, meteor, showers, are, named, after, the, nearest, constellation, or, bright, star, with, a, greek, or, roman, letter, assigned, that, is, close, to, the, radiant, position, at, the, peak, of, the, shower, whereby, the, grammatical, declension, of, the, latin, possessive, form, is, replaced, by, id, or, ids, hence, meteors, radiating, from, near, the, star, delta, aquarii, declension, i, are, called, the, delta, aquariids, the, international, astronomical, union, s, task, group, on, meteor, shower, nomenclature, and, the, iau, s, meteor, data, center, keep, track, of, meteor, shower, nomenclature, and, which, showers, are, established, a, meteor, shower, results, from, an, interaction, between, a, planet, such, as, earth, and, streams, of, debris, from, a, comet, comets, can, produce, debris, by, water, vapor, drag, as, demonstrated, by, fred, whipple, in, 1951, and, by, breakup, whipple, envisioned, comets, as, dirty, snowballs, made, up, of, rock, embedded, in, ice, orbiting, the, sun, the, ice, may, be, water, methane, ammonia, or, other, volatiles, alone, or, in, combination, the, rock, may, vary, in, size, from, a, dust, mote, to, a, small, boulder, dust, mote, sized, solids, are, orders, of, magnitude, more, common, than, those, the, size, of, sand, grains, which, in, turn, are, similarly, more, common, than, those, the, size, of, pebbles, and, so, on, when, the, ice, warms, and, sublimates, the, vapor, can, drag, along, dust, sand, and, pebbles, each, time, a, comet, swings, by, the, sun, in, its, orbit, some, of, its, ice, vaporizes, and, a, certain, number, of, meteoroids, will, be, shed, the, meteoroids, spread, out, along, the, entire, trajectory, of, the, comet, to, form, a, meteoroid, stream, also, known, as, a, dust, trail, as, opposed, to, a, comet, s, gas, tail, caused, by, the, tiny, particles, that, are, quickly, blown, away, by, solar, radiation, pressure, recently, peter, jenniskens, has, argued, that, most, of, our, short, period, meteor, showers, are, not, from, the, normal, water, vapor, drag, of, active, comets, but, the, product, of, infrequent, disintegrations, when, large, chunks, break, off, a, mostly, dormant, comet, examples, are, the, quadrantids, and, geminids, which, originated, from, a, breakup, of, asteroid, looking, objects, 196256, 2003, eh, 1, and, 3200, phaethon, respectively, about, 500, and, 1000, years, ago, the, fragments, tend, to, fall, apart, quickly, into, dust, sand, and, pebbles, and, spread, out, along, the, comet, s, orbit, to, form, a, dense, meteoroid, stream, which, subsequently, evolves, into, earth, s, path, shortly, after, whipple, predicted, that, dust, particles, traveled, at, low, speeds, relative, to, the, comet, milos, plavec, was, the, first, to, offer, the, idea, of, a, dust, trail, when, he, calculated, how, meteoroids, once, freed, from, the, comet, would, drift, mostly, in, front, of, or, behind, the, comet, after, completing, one, orbit, the, effect, is, simple, celestial, mechanics, the, material, drifts, only, a, little, laterally, away, from, the, comet, while, drifting, ahead, or, behind, the, comet, because, some, particles, make, a, wider, orbit, than, others, these, dust, trails, are, sometimes, observed, in, comet, images, taken, at, mid, infrared, wavelengths, heat, radiation, where, dust, particles, from, the, previous, return, to, the, sun, are, spread, along, the, orbit, of, the, comet, see, figures, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, planets, determines, where, the, dust, trail, would, pass, by, earth, orbit, much, like, a, gardener, directing, a, hose, to, water, a, distant, plant, most, years, those, trails, would, miss, the, earth, altogether, but, in, some, years, the, earth, is, showered, by, meteors, this, effect, was, first, demonstrated, from, observations, of, the, 1995, alpha, monocerotids, and, from, earlier, not, widely, known, identifications, of, past, earth, storms, over, more, extended, periods, the, dust, trails, can, evolve, in, complicated, ways, for, example, the, orbits, of, some, repeating, comets, and, meteoroids, leaving, them, are, in, resonant, orbits, with, jupiter, or, one, of, the, other, large, planets, so, many, revolutions, of, one, will, equal, another, number, of, the, other, this, creates, a, shower, component, called, a, filament, a, second, effect, is, a, close, encounter, with, a, planet, when, the, meteoroids, pass, by, earth, some, are, accelerated, making, wider, orbits, around, the, sun, others, are, decelerated, making, shorter, orbits, resulting, in, gaps, in, the, dust, trail, in, the, next, return, like, opening, a, curtain, with, grains, piling, up, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, gap, also, jupiter, s, perturbation, can, dramatically, change, sections, of, the, dust, trail, especially, for, a, short, period, comets, when, the, grains, approach, the, giant, planet, at, their, furthest, point, along, the, orbit, around, the, sun, moving, most, slowly, as, a, result, the, trail, has, a, clumping, a, braiding, or, a, tangling, of, crescents, of, each, release, of, material, the, third, effect, is, that, of, radiation, pressure, which, will, push, less, massive, particles, into, orbits, further, from, the, sun, while, more, massive, objects, responsible, for, bolides, or, fireballs, will, tend, to, be, affected, less, by, radiation, pressure, this, makes, some, dust, trail, encounters, rich, in, bright, meteors, others, rich, in, faint, meteors, over, time, these, effects, disperse, the, meteoroids, and, create, a, broader, stream, the, meteors, we, see, from, these, streams, are, part, of, annual, showers, because, earth, encounters, those, streams, every, year, at, much, the, same, rate, when, the, meteoroids, collide, with, other, meteoroids, in, the, zodiacal, cloud, they, lose, their, stream, association, and, become, part, of, the, sporadic, meteors, background, long, since, dispersed, from, any, stream, or, trail, they, form, isolated, meteors, not, a, part, of, any, shower, these, random, meteors, will, not, appear, to, come, from, the, radiant, of, the, leading, shower, in, most, years, the, most, visible, meteor, shower, is, the, perseids, which, peak, on, 12, august, of, each, year, at, over, one, meteor, per, minute, nasa, has, a, tool, to, calculate, how, many, meteors, per, hour, are, visible, from, one, s, observing, location, the, leonid, meteor, shower, peaks, around, 17, november, of, each, year, the, leonid, shower, produces, a, meteor, storm, peaking, at, rates, of, thousands, of, meteors, per, hour, leonid, storms, gave, birth, to, the, term, meteor, shower, when, it, was, first, realised, that, during, the, november, 1833, storm, the, meteors, radiated, from, near, the, star, gamma, leonis, the, last, leonid, storms, were, in, 1999, 2001, two, and, 2002, two, before, that, there, were, storms, in, 1767, 1799, 1833, 1866, 1867, and, 1966, when, the, leonid, shower, is, not, storming, it, is, less, active, than, the, perseids, see, the, infographics, on, meteor, shower, calendar, 2021, on, the, right, official, names, are, given, in, the, international, astronomical, union, s, list, of, meteor, showers, any, other, solar, system, body, with, a, reasonably, transparent, atmosphere, can, also, have, meteor, showers, as, the, moon, is, in, the, neighborhood, of, earth, it, can, experience, the, same, showers, but, will, have, its, own, phenomena, due, to, its, lack, of, an, atmosphere, per, se, such, as, vastly, increasing, its, sodium, tail, nasa, now, maintains, an, ongoing, database, of, observed, impacts, on, the, moon, maintained, by, the, marshall, space, flight, center, whether, from, a, shower, or, not, many, planets, and, moons, have, impact, craters, dating, back, large, spans, of, time, but, new, craters, perhaps, even, related, to, meteor, showers, are, possible, mars, and, thus, its, moons, is, known, to, have, meteor, showers, these, have, not, been, observed, on, other, planets, as, yet, but, may, be, presumed, to, exist, for, mars, in, particular, although, these, are, different, from, the, ones, seen, on, earth, because, of, the, different, orbits, of, mars, and, earth, relative, to, the, orbits, of, comets, the, martian, atmosphere, has, less, than, one, percent, of, the, density, of, earth, s, at, ground, level, at, their, upper, edges, where, meteoroids, strike, the, two, are, more, similar, because, of, the, similar, air, pressure, at, altitudes, for, meteors, the, effects, are, much, the, same, only, the, relatively, slower, motion, of, the, meteoroids, due, to, increased, distance, from, the, sun, should, marginally, decrease, meteor, brightness, this, is, somewhat, balanced, because, the, slower, descent, means, that, martian, meteors, have, more, time, to, ablate, on, march, 7, 2004, the, panoramic, camera, on, mars, exploration, rover, spirit, recorded, a, streak, which, is, now, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, a, meteor, from, a, martian, meteor, shower, associated, with, comet, 114p, wiseman, skiff, a, strong, display, from, this, shower, was, expected, on, december, 20, 2007, other, showers, speculated, about, are, a, lambda, geminid, shower, associated, with, the, eta, aquariids, of, earth, i, e, both, associated, with, comet, 1p, halley, a, beta, canis, major, shower, associated, with, comet, 13p, olbers, and, draconids, from, 5335, damocles, isolated, massive, impacts, have, been, observed, at, jupiter, the, 1994, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, which, formed, a, brief, trail, as, well, and, successive, events, since, then, see, list, of, jupiter, events, meteors, or, meteor, showers, have, been, discussed, for, most, of, the, objects, in, the, solar, system, with, an, atmosphere, mercury, venus, saturn, s, moon, titan, neptune, s, moon, triton, and, pluto
