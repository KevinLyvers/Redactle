magnesium, sulfate, or, magnesium, sulphate, is, a, chemical, compound, a, salt, with, the, formula, mgso, 4, consisting, of, magnesium, cations, mg, 2, 20, 19, by, mass, and, sulfate, anions, so, 2, 4, it, is, a, white, crystalline, solid, soluble, in, water, but, not, in, ethanol, magnesium, sulfate, is, usually, encountered, in, the, form, of, a, hydrate, mgso, 4, n, h, 2, o, for, various, values, of, n, between, 1, and, 11, the, most, common, is, the, heptahydrate, mgso, 4, 7h, 2, o, known, as, epsom, salt, which, is, a, household, chemical, with, many, traditional, uses, including, bath, salts, the, main, use, of, magnesium, sulfate, is, in, agriculture, to, correct, soils, deficient, in, magnesium, an, essential, plant, nutrient, because, of, the, role, of, magnesium, in, chlorophyll, and, photosynthesis, the, monohydrate, is, favored, for, this, use, by, the, mid, 1970s, its, production, was, 2, 3, million, tons, per, year, the, anhydrous, form, and, several, hydrates, occur, in, nature, as, minerals, and, the, salt, is, a, significant, component, of, the, water, from, some, springs, magnesium, sulfate, can, crystallize, as, several, hydrates, including, as, of, 2017, the, existence, of, the, decahydrate, apparently, has, not, been, confirmed, all, the, hydrates, lose, water, upon, heating, above, 320, c, only, the, anhydrous, form, is, stable, it, decomposes, without, melting, at, 1124, c, into, magnesium, oxide, mgo, and, sulfur, trioxide, so, 3, the, heptahydrate, takes, its, common, name, epsom, salt, from, a, bitter, saline, spring, in, epsom, in, surrey, england, where, the, salt, was, produced, from, the, springs, that, arise, where, the, porous, chalk, of, the, north, downs, meets, the, impervious, london, clay, the, heptahydrate, readily, loses, one, equivalent, of, water, to, form, the, hexahydrate, it, is, a, natural, source, of, both, magnesium, and, sulphur, epsom, salts, are, commonly, used, in, bath, salts, exfoliants, muscle, relaxers, and, pain, relievers, however, these, are, different, from, epsom, salts, that, are, used, for, gardening, as, they, contain, aromas, and, perfumes, not, suitable, for, plants, magnesium, sulfate, monohydrate, or, kieserite, can, be, prepared, by, heating, the, heptahydrate, to, 120, c, further, heating, to, 250, c, gives, anhydrous, magnesium, sulfate, kieserite, exhibits, monoclinic, symmetry, at, pressures, lower, than, 2, 7, gpa, after, which, it, transforms, to, phase, of, triclinic, symmetry, the, undecahydrate, mgso, 4, 11h, 2, o, meridianiite, is, stable, at, atmospheric, pressure, only, below, 2, c, above, that, temperature, it, liquefies, into, a, mix, of, solid, heptahydrate, and, a, saturated, solution, it, has, a, eutectic, point, with, water, at, 3, 9, c, and, 17, 3, mass, of, mgso, 4, large, crystals, can, be, obtained, from, solutions, of, the, proper, concentration, kept, at, 0, c, for, a, few, days, at, pressures, of, about, 0, 9, gpa, and, at, 240, k, meridianiite, decomposes, into, a, mixture, of, ice, vi, and, the, enneahydrate, mgso, 4, 9h, 2, o, the, enneahydrate, mgso, 4, 9h, 2, o, was, identified, and, characterized, only, recently, even, though, it, seems, easy, to, produce, by, cooling, a, solution, of, mgso, 4, and, sodium, sulfate, na, 2, so, 4, in, suitable, proportions, the, structure, is, monoclinic, with, unit, cell, parameters, at, 250, k, a, 0, 675, nm, b, 1, 195, nm, c, 1, 465, nm, 95, 1, v, 1, 177, nm, 3, with, z, 4, the, most, probable, space, group, is, p21, c, magnesium, selenate, also, forms, an, enneahydrate, mgseo, 4, 9h, 2, o, but, with, a, different, crystal, structure, as, mg, 2, and, so, 2, 4, ions, are, respectively, the, second, most, abundant, cation, and, anion, present, in, seawater, after, na, and, cl, magnesium, sulfates, are, common, minerals, in, geological, environments, their, occurrence, is, mostly, connected, with, supergene, processes, some, of, them, are, also, important, constituents, of, evaporitic, potassium, magnesium, k, mg, salts, deposits, bright, spots, observed, by, the, dawn, spacecraft, in, occator, crater, on, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, are, most, consistent, with, reflected, light, from, magnesium, sulfate, hexahydrate, almost, all, known, mineralogical, forms, of, mgso, 4, are, hydrates, epsomite, is, the, natural, analogue, of, epsom, salt, meridianiite, mgso, 4, 11h, 2, o, has, been, observed, on, the, surface, of, frozen, lakes, and, is, thought, to, also, occur, on, mars, hexahydrite, is, the, next, lower, hydrate, three, next, lower, hydrates, pentahydrite, starkeyite, and, especially, sanderite, are, rare, kieserite, is, a, monohydrate, and, is, common, among, evaporitic, deposits, anhydrous, magnesium, sulfate, was, reported, from, some, burning, coal, dumps, magnesium, sulfate, is, usually, obtained, directly, from, dry, lake, beds, and, other, natural, sources, it, can, also, be, prepared, by, reacting, magnesite, magnesium, carbonate, mgco, 3, or, magnesia, oxide, mgo, with, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, another, possible, method, is, to, treat, seawater, or, magnesium, containing, industrial, wastes, so, as, to, precipitate, magnesium, hydroxide, and, react, the, precipitate, with, sulfuric, acid, also, magnesium, sulfate, heptahydrate, epsomite, mgso, 4, 7h, 2, o, is, manufactured, by, dissolution, of, magnesium, sulfate, monohydrate, kieserite, mgso, 4, h, 2, o, in, water, and, subsequent, crystallization, of, the, heptahydrate, magnesium, sulfate, relaxation, is, the, primary, mechanism, that, causes, the, absorption, of, sound, in, seawater, at, frequencies, above, 10, khz, acoustic, energy, is, converted, to, thermal, energy, lower, frequencies, are, less, absorbed, by, the, salt, so, that, low, frequency, sound, travels, farther, in, the, ocean, boric, acid, and, magnesium, carbonate, also, contribute, to, absorption, magnesium, sulfate, is, used, both, externally, as, epsom, salt, and, internally, the, main, external, use, is, the, formulation, as, bath, salts, especially, for, foot, baths, to, soothe, sore, feet, such, baths, have, been, claimed, to, also, soothe, and, hasten, recovery, from, muscle, pain, soreness, or, injury, potential, health, effects, of, magnesium, sulfate, are, reflected, in, medical, studies, on, the, impact, of, magnesium, on, resistant, depression, and, as, an, analgesic, for, migraine, and, chronic, pain, magnesium, sulfate, has, been, studied, in, the, treatment, of, asthma, preeclampsia, and, eclampsia, magnesium, sulfate, is, the, usual, component, of, the, concentrated, salt, solution, used, in, isolation, tanks, to, increase, its, specific, gravity, to, approximately, 1, 25, 1, 26, this, high, density, allows, an, individual, to, float, effortlessly, on, the, surface, of, water, in, the, closed, tank, eliminating, stimulation, of, as, many, of, the, external, senses, as, possible, in, the, uk, a, medication, containing, magnesium, sulfate, and, phenol, called, drawing, paste, is, useful, for, small, boils, or, localized, infections, and, removing, splinters, internally, magnesium, sulfate, may, be, administered, by, oral, respiratory, or, intravenous, routes, internal, uses, include, replacement, therapy, for, magnesium, deficiency, treatment, of, acute, and, severe, arrhythmias, as, a, bronchodilator, in, the, treatment, of, asthma, preventing, eclampsia, and, cerebral, palsy, a, tocolytic, agent, and, as, an, anticonvulsant, it, also, may, be, used, as, laxative, in, agriculture, magnesium, sulfate, is, used, to, increase, magnesium, or, sulfur, content, in, soil, it, is, most, commonly, applied, to, potted, plants, or, to, magnesium, hungry, crops, such, as, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, lemons, and, roses, the, advantage, of, magnesium, sulfate, over, other, magnesium, soil, amendments, such, as, dolomitic, lime, is, its, high, solubility, which, also, allows, the, option, of, foliar, feeding, solutions, of, magnesium, sulfate, are, also, nearly, ph, neutral, compared, with, the, slightly, alkaline, salts, of, magnesium, as, found, in, limestone, therefore, the, use, of, magnesium, sulfate, as, a, magnesium, source, for, soil, does, not, significantly, change, the, soil, ph, contrary, to, the, popular, belief, that, magnesium, sulfate, is, able, to, control, pests, and, slugs, helps, seeds, germination, produce, more, flowers, improve, nutrient, uptake, and, is, environmentally, friendly, it, does, none, of, the, purported, claims, except, for, correcting, magnesium, deficiency, in, soils, magnesium, sulfate, can, even, pollute, water, if, used, in, excessive, amounts, magnesium, sulfate, was, historically, used, as, a, treatment, for, lead, poisoning, prior, to, the, development, of, chelation, therapy, as, it, was, hoped, that, any, lead, ingested, would, be, precipitated, out, by, the, magnesium, sulfate, and, subsequently, purged, from, the, digestive, system, this, application, saw, particularly, widespread, use, among, veterinarians, during, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, epsom, salt, was, already, available, on, many, farms, for, agricultural, use, and, it, was, often, prescribed, in, the, treatment, of, farm, animals, that, inadvertently, ingested, lead, magnesium, sulfate, is, used, as, anhydrous, magnesium, sulfate, is, commonly, used, as, a, desiccant, in, organic, synthesis, owing, to, its, affinity, for, water, and, compatibility, with, most, organic, compounds, during, work, up, an, organic, phase, is, treated, with, anhydrous, magnesium, sulfate, the, hydrated, solid, is, then, removed, by, filtration, decantation, or, by, distillation, if, the, boiling, point, is, low, enough, other, inorganic, sulfate, salts, such, as, sodium, sulfate, and, calcium, sulfate, may, be, used, in, the, same, way, magnesium, sulfate, is, used, to, prepare, specific, cements, by, the, reaction, between, magnesium, oxide, and, magnesium, sulfate, solution, which, are, of, good, binding, ability, and, more, resistance, than, portland, cement, this, cement, is, mainly, utilized, in, the, production, of, lightweight, insulation, panels, although, its, poor, water, resistance, limits, its, usage, magnesium, or, sodium, sulfate, is, also, used, for, testing, aggregates, for, soundness, in, accordance, with, astm, c88, standard, when, there, are, no, service, records, of, the, material, exposed, to, actual, weathering, conditions, the, test, is, accomplished, by, repeated, immersion, in, saturated, solutions, followed, by, oven, drying, to, dehydrate, the, salt, precipitated, in, permeable, pore, spaces, the, internal, expansive, force, derived, from, the, rehydration, of, the, salt, upon, re, immersion, simulates, the, expansion, of, water, on, freezing, magnesium, sulfate, is, also, used, to, test, the, resistance, of, concrete, to, external, sulfate, attack, esa, magnesium, sulfate, heptahydrate, is, also, used, to, maintain, the, magnesium, concentration, in, marine, aquaria, which, contain, large, amounts, of, stony, corals, as, it, is, slowly, depleted, in, their, calcification, process, in, a, magnesium, deficient, marine, aquarium, calcium, and, alkalinity, concentrations, are, very, difficult, to, control, because, not, enough, magnesium, is, present, to, stabilize, these, ions, in, the, saltwater, and, prevent, their, spontaneous, precipitation, into, calcium, carbonate, double, salts, containing, magnesium, sulfate, exist, there, are, several, known, as, sodium, magnesium, sulfates, and, potassium, magnesium, sulfates, a, mixed, copper, magnesium, sulfate, heptahydrate, mg, cu, so, 4, 7h, 2, o, was, found, to, occur, in, mine, tailings, and, was, given, the, mineral, name, alpersite
