a, force, is, an, influence, that, can, cause, an, object, to, change, its, velocity, unless, counterbalanced, by, other, forces, the, concept, of, force, makes, the, everyday, notion, of, pushing, or, pulling, mathematically, precise, because, the, magnitude, and, direction, of, a, force, are, both, important, force, is, a, vector, quantity, the, si, unit, of, force, is, the, newton, n, and, force, is, often, represented, by, the, symbol, f, force, plays, an, important, role, in, classical, mechanics, the, concept, of, force, is, central, to, all, three, of, newton, s, laws, of, motion, types, of, forces, often, encountered, in, classical, mechanics, include, elastic, frictional, contact, or, normal, forces, and, gravitational, the, rotational, version, of, force, is, torque, which, produces, changes, in, the, rotational, speed, of, an, object, in, an, extended, body, each, part, often, applies, forces, on, the, adjacent, parts, the, distribution, of, such, forces, through, the, body, is, the, internal, mechanical, stress, in, equilibrium, these, stresses, cause, no, acceleration, of, the, body, as, the, forces, balance, one, another, if, these, are, not, in, equilibrium, they, can, cause, deformation, of, solid, materials, or, flow, in, fluids, in, modern, physics, which, includes, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, the, laws, governing, motion, are, revised, to, rely, on, fundamental, interactions, as, the, ultimate, origin, of, force, however, the, understanding, of, force, provided, by, classical, mechanics, is, useful, for, practical, purposes, philosophers, in, antiquity, used, the, concept, of, force, in, the, study, of, stationary, and, moving, objects, and, simple, machines, but, thinkers, such, as, aristotle, and, archimedes, retained, fundamental, errors, in, understanding, force, in, part, this, was, due, to, an, incomplete, understanding, of, the, sometimes, non, obvious, force, of, friction, and, a, consequently, inadequate, view, of, the, nature, of, natural, motion, a, fundamental, error, was, the, belief, that, a, force, is, required, to, maintain, motion, even, at, a, constant, velocity, most, of, the, previous, misunderstandings, about, motion, and, force, were, eventually, corrected, by, galileo, galilei, and, sir, isaac, newton, with, his, mathematical, insight, newton, formulated, laws, of, motion, that, were, not, improved, for, over, two, hundred, years, by, the, early, 20th, century, einstein, developed, a, theory, of, relativity, that, correctly, predicted, the, action, of, forces, on, objects, with, increasing, momenta, near, the, speed, of, light, and, also, provided, insight, into, the, forces, produced, by, gravitation, and, inertia, with, modern, insights, into, quantum, mechanics, and, technology, that, can, accelerate, particles, close, to, the, speed, of, light, particle, physics, has, devised, a, standard, model, to, describe, forces, between, particles, smaller, than, atoms, the, standard, model, predicts, that, exchanged, particles, called, gauge, bosons, are, the, fundamental, means, by, which, forces, are, emitted, and, absorbed, only, four, main, interactions, are, known, in, order, of, decreasing, strength, they, are, strong, electromagnetic, weak, and, gravitational, 2, 10, 79, high, energy, particle, physics, observations, made, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, confirmed, that, the, weak, and, electromagnetic, forces, are, expressions, of, a, more, fundamental, electroweak, interaction, since, antiquity, the, concept, of, force, has, been, recognized, as, integral, to, the, functioning, of, each, of, the, simple, machines, the, mechanical, advantage, given, by, a, simple, machine, allowed, for, less, force, to, be, used, in, exchange, for, that, force, acting, over, a, greater, distance, for, the, same, amount, of, work, analysis, of, the, characteristics, of, forces, ultimately, culminated, in, the, work, of, archimedes, who, was, especially, famous, for, formulating, a, treatment, of, buoyant, forces, inherent, in, fluids, aristotle, provided, a, philosophical, discussion, of, the, concept, of, a, force, as, an, integral, part, of, aristotelian, cosmology, in, aristotle, s, view, the, terrestrial, sphere, contained, four, elements, that, come, to, rest, at, different, natural, places, therein, aristotle, believed, that, motionless, objects, on, earth, those, composed, mostly, of, the, elements, earth, and, water, were, in, their, natural, place, when, on, the, ground, and, that, they, stay, that, way, if, left, alone, he, distinguished, between, the, innate, tendency, of, objects, to, find, their, natural, place, e, g, for, heavy, bodies, to, fall, which, led, to, natural, motion, and, unnatural, or, forced, motion, which, required, continued, application, of, a, force, this, theory, based, on, the, everyday, experience, of, how, objects, move, such, as, the, constant, application, of, a, force, needed, to, keep, a, cart, moving, had, conceptual, trouble, accounting, for, the, behavior, of, projectiles, such, as, the, flight, of, arrows, an, archer, causes, the, arrow, to, move, at, the, start, of, the, flight, and, it, then, sails, through, the, air, even, though, no, discernible, efficient, cause, acts, upon, it, aristotle, was, aware, of, this, problem, and, proposed, that, the, air, displaced, through, the, projectile, s, path, carries, the, projectile, to, its, target, this, explanation, requires, a, continuous, medium, such, as, air, to, sustain, the, motion, though, aristotelian, physics, was, criticized, as, early, as, the, 6th, century, its, shortcomings, would, not, be, corrected, until, the, 17th, century, work, of, galileo, galilei, who, was, influenced, by, the, late, medieval, idea, that, objects, in, forced, motion, carried, an, innate, force, of, impetus, galileo, constructed, an, experiment, in, which, stones, and, cannonballs, were, both, rolled, down, an, incline, to, disprove, the, aristotelian, theory, of, motion, he, showed, that, the, bodies, were, accelerated, by, gravity, to, an, extent, that, was, independent, of, their, mass, and, argued, that, objects, retain, their, velocity, unless, acted, on, by, a, force, for, example, friction, galileo, s, idea, that, force, is, needed, to, change, motion, rather, than, to, sustain, it, further, improved, upon, by, isaac, beeckman, ren, descartes, and, pierre, gassendi, became, a, key, principle, of, newtonian, physics, in, the, early, 17th, century, before, newton, s, principia, the, term, force, latin, vis, was, applied, to, many, physical, and, non, physical, phenomena, e, g, for, an, acceleration, of, a, point, the, product, of, a, point, mass, and, the, square, of, its, velocity, was, named, vis, viva, live, force, by, leibniz, the, modern, concept, of, force, corresponds, to, newton, s, vis, motrix, accelerating, force, sir, isaac, newton, described, the, motion, of, all, objects, using, the, concepts, of, inertia, and, force, in, 1687, newton, published, his, magnum, opus, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, in, this, work, newton, set, out, three, laws, of, motion, that, have, dominated, the, way, forces, are, described, in, physics, to, this, day, the, precise, ways, in, which, newton, s, laws, are, expressed, have, evolved, in, step, with, new, mathematical, approaches, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, states, that, the, natural, behavior, of, an, object, at, rest, is, to, continue, being, at, rest, and, the, natural, behavior, of, an, object, moving, at, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, is, to, continue, moving, at, that, constant, speed, along, that, straight, line, the, latter, follows, from, the, former, because, of, the, principle, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, the, same, for, all, inertial, observers, i, e, all, observers, who, do, not, feel, themselves, to, be, in, motion, an, observer, moving, in, tandem, with, an, object, will, see, it, as, being, at, rest, so, its, natural, behavior, will, be, to, remain, at, rest, with, respect, to, that, observer, which, means, that, an, observer, who, sees, it, moving, at, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, will, see, it, continuing, to, do, so, 1, 7, according, to, the, first, law, motion, at, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, does, not, need, a, cause, it, is, change, in, motion, that, requires, a, cause, and, newton, s, second, law, gives, the, quantitative, relationship, between, force, and, change, of, motion, newton, s, second, law, states, that, the, net, force, acting, upon, an, object, is, equal, to, the, rate, at, which, its, momentum, changes, with, time, if, the, mass, of, the, object, is, constant, this, law, implies, that, the, acceleration, of, an, object, is, directly, proportional, to, the, net, force, acting, on, the, object, is, in, the, direction, of, the, net, force, and, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, mass, of, the, object, 204, 207, a, modern, statement, of, newton, s, second, law, is, a, vector, equation, f, d, p, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, p, mathrm, d, t, where, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, is, the, momentum, of, the, system, and, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, is, the, net, vector, sum, force, 399, if, a, body, is, in, equilibrium, there, is, zero, net, force, by, definition, balanced, forces, may, be, present, nevertheless, in, contrast, the, second, law, states, that, if, there, is, an, unbalanced, force, acting, on, an, object, it, will, result, in, the, object, s, momentum, changing, over, time, in, common, engineering, applications, the, mass, in, a, system, remains, constant, allowing, as, simple, algebraic, form, for, the, second, law, by, the, definition, of, momentum, f, d, p, d, t, d, m, v, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, p, mathrm, d, t, frac, mathrm, d, left, m, mathbf, v, right, mathrm, d, t, where, m, is, the, mass, and, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, is, the, velocity, 9, 1, 9, 2, if, newton, s, second, law, is, applied, to, a, system, of, constant, mass, m, may, be, moved, outside, the, derivative, operator, the, equation, then, becomes, f, m, d, v, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, v, mathrm, d, t, by, substituting, the, definition, of, acceleration, the, algebraic, version, of, newton, s, second, law, is, derived, f, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, a, whenever, one, body, exerts, a, force, on, another, the, latter, simultaneously, exerts, an, equal, and, opposite, force, on, the, first, in, vector, form, if, f, 1, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 1, 2, is, the, force, of, body, 1, on, body, 2, and, f, 2, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 2, 1, that, of, body, 2, on, body, 1, then, f, 1, 2, f, 2, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 1, 2, mathbf, f, 2, 1, this, law, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, action, reaction, law, with, f, 1, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 1, 2, called, the, action, and, f, 2, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 2, 1, the, reaction, newton, s, third, law, is, a, result, of, applying, symmetry, to, situations, where, forces, can, be, attributed, to, the, presence, of, different, objects, the, third, law, means, that, all, forces, are, interactions, between, different, bodies, and, thus, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, unidirectional, force, or, a, force, that, acts, on, only, one, body, in, a, system, composed, of, object, 1, and, object, 2, the, net, force, on, the, system, due, to, their, mutual, interactions, is, zero, f, 1, 2, f, 2, 1, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 1, 2, mathbf, f, 2, 1, 0, more, generally, in, a, closed, system, of, particles, all, internal, forces, are, balanced, the, particles, may, accelerate, with, respect, to, each, other, but, the, center, of, mass, of, the, system, will, not, accelerate, if, an, external, force, acts, on, the, system, it, will, make, the, center, of, mass, accelerate, in, proportion, to, the, magnitude, of, the, external, force, divided, by, the, mass, of, the, system, 19, 1, combining, newton, s, second, and, third, laws, it, is, possible, to, show, that, the, linear, momentum, of, a, system, is, conserved, in, any, closed, system, in, a, system, of, two, particles, if, p, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 1, is, the, momentum, of, object, 1, and, p, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 2, the, momentum, of, object, 2, then, d, p, 1, d, t, d, p, 2, d, t, f, 1, 2, f, 2, 1, 0, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, p, 1, mathrm, d, t, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, p, 2, mathrm, d, t, mathbf, f, 1, 2, mathbf, f, 2, 1, 0, using, similar, arguments, this, can, be, generalized, to, a, system, with, an, arbitrary, number, of, particles, in, general, as, long, as, all, forces, are, due, to, the, interaction, of, objects, with, mass, it, is, possible, to, define, a, system, such, that, net, momentum, is, never, lost, nor, gained, ch, 12, some, textbooks, use, newton, s, second, law, as, a, definition, of, force, however, for, the, equation, f, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, a, for, a, constant, mass, m, displaystyle, m, to, then, have, any, predictive, content, it, must, be, combined, with, further, information, 12, 1, moreover, inferring, that, a, force, is, present, because, a, body, is, accelerating, is, only, valid, in, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, 59, the, question, of, which, aspects, of, newton, s, laws, to, take, as, definitions, and, which, to, regard, as, holding, physical, content, has, been, answered, in, various, ways, vii, which, ultimately, do, not, affect, how, the, theory, is, used, in, practice, notable, physicists, philosophers, and, mathematicians, who, have, sought, a, more, explicit, definition, of, the, concept, of, force, include, ernst, mach, and, walter, noll, forces, act, in, a, particular, direction, and, have, sizes, dependent, upon, how, strong, the, push, or, pull, is, because, of, these, characteristics, forces, are, classified, as, vector, quantities, this, means, that, forces, follow, a, different, set, of, mathematical, rules, than, physical, quantities, that, do, not, have, direction, denoted, scalar, quantities, for, example, when, determining, what, happens, when, two, forces, act, on, the, same, object, it, is, necessary, to, know, both, the, magnitude, and, the, direction, of, both, forces, to, calculate, the, result, if, both, of, these, pieces, of, information, are, not, known, for, each, force, the, situation, is, ambiguous, 197, historically, forces, were, first, quantitatively, investigated, in, conditions, of, static, equilibrium, where, several, forces, canceled, each, other, out, such, experiments, demonstrate, the, crucial, properties, that, forces, are, additive, vector, quantities, they, have, magnitude, and, direction, when, two, forces, act, on, a, point, particle, the, resulting, force, the, resultant, also, called, the, net, force, can, be, determined, by, following, the, parallelogram, rule, of, vector, addition, the, addition, of, two, vectors, represented, by, sides, of, a, parallelogram, gives, an, equivalent, resultant, vector, that, is, equal, in, magnitude, and, direction, to, the, transversal, of, the, parallelogram, the, magnitude, of, the, resultant, varies, from, the, difference, of, the, magnitudes, of, the, two, forces, to, their, sum, depending, on, the, angle, between, their, lines, of, action, ch, 12, free, body, diagrams, can, be, used, as, a, convenient, way, to, keep, track, of, forces, acting, on, a, system, ideally, these, diagrams, are, drawn, with, the, angles, and, relative, magnitudes, of, the, force, vectors, preserved, so, that, graphical, vector, addition, can, be, done, to, determine, the, net, force, as, well, as, being, added, forces, can, also, be, resolved, into, independent, components, at, right, angles, to, each, other, a, horizontal, force, pointing, northeast, can, therefore, be, split, into, two, forces, one, pointing, north, and, one, pointing, east, summing, these, component, forces, using, vector, addition, yields, the, original, force, resolving, force, vectors, into, components, of, a, set, of, basis, vectors, is, often, a, more, mathematically, clean, way, to, describe, forces, than, using, magnitudes, and, directions, this, is, because, for, orthogonal, components, the, components, of, the, vector, sum, are, uniquely, determined, by, the, scalar, addition, of, the, components, of, the, individual, vectors, orthogonal, components, are, independent, of, each, other, because, forces, acting, at, ninety, degrees, to, each, other, have, no, effect, on, the, magnitude, or, direction, of, the, other, choosing, a, set, of, orthogonal, basis, vectors, is, often, done, by, considering, what, set, of, basis, vectors, will, make, the, mathematics, most, convenient, choosing, a, basis, vector, that, is, in, the, same, direction, as, one, of, the, forces, is, desirable, since, that, force, would, then, have, only, one, non, zero, component, orthogonal, force, vectors, can, be, three, dimensional, with, the, third, component, being, at, right, angles, to, the, other, two, ch, 12, when, all, the, forces, that, act, upon, an, object, are, balanced, then, the, object, is, said, to, be, in, a, state, of, equilibrium, 566, hence, equilibrium, occurs, when, the, resultant, force, acting, on, a, point, particle, is, zero, that, is, the, vector, sum, of, all, forces, is, zero, when, dealing, with, an, extended, body, it, is, also, necessary, that, the, net, torque, be, zero, a, body, is, in, static, equilibrium, with, respect, to, a, frame, of, reference, if, it, at, rest, and, not, accelerating, whereas, a, body, in, dynamic, equilibrium, is, moving, at, a, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, i, e, moving, but, not, accelerating, what, one, observer, sees, as, static, equilibrium, another, can, see, as, dynamic, equilibrium, and, vice, versa, 566, static, equilibrium, was, understood, well, before, the, invention, of, classical, mechanics, objects, that, are, not, accelerating, have, zero, net, force, acting, on, them, the, simplest, case, of, static, equilibrium, occurs, when, two, forces, are, equal, in, magnitude, but, opposite, in, direction, for, example, an, object, on, a, level, surface, is, pulled, attracted, downward, toward, the, center, of, the, earth, by, the, force, of, gravity, at, the, same, time, a, force, is, applied, by, the, surface, that, resists, the, downward, force, with, equal, upward, force, called, a, normal, force, the, situation, produces, zero, net, force, and, hence, no, acceleration, pushing, against, an, object, that, rests, on, a, frictional, surface, can, result, in, a, situation, where, the, object, does, not, move, because, the, applied, force, is, opposed, by, static, friction, generated, between, the, object, and, the, table, surface, for, a, situation, with, no, movement, the, static, friction, force, exactly, balances, the, applied, force, resulting, in, no, acceleration, the, static, friction, increases, or, decreases, in, response, to, the, applied, force, up, to, an, upper, limit, determined, by, the, characteristics, of, the, contact, between, the, surface, and, the, object, a, static, equilibrium, between, two, forces, is, the, most, usual, way, of, measuring, forces, using, simple, devices, such, as, weighing, scales, and, spring, balances, for, example, an, object, suspended, on, a, vertical, spring, scale, experiences, the, force, of, gravity, acting, on, the, object, balanced, by, a, force, applied, by, the, spring, reaction, force, which, equals, the, object, s, weight, using, such, tools, some, quantitative, force, laws, were, discovered, that, the, force, of, gravity, is, proportional, to, volume, for, objects, of, constant, density, widely, exploited, for, millennia, to, define, standard, weights, archimedes, principle, for, buoyancy, archimedes, analysis, of, the, lever, boyle, s, law, for, gas, pressure, and, hooke, s, law, for, springs, these, were, all, formulated, and, experimentally, verified, before, isaac, newton, expounded, his, three, laws, of, motion, ch, 12, dynamic, equilibrium, was, first, described, by, galileo, who, noticed, that, certain, assumptions, of, aristotelian, physics, were, contradicted, by, observations, and, logic, galileo, realized, that, simple, velocity, addition, demands, that, the, concept, of, an, absolute, rest, frame, did, not, exist, galileo, concluded, that, motion, in, a, constant, velocity, was, completely, equivalent, to, rest, this, was, contrary, to, aristotle, s, notion, of, a, natural, state, of, rest, that, objects, with, mass, naturally, approached, simple, experiments, showed, that, galileo, s, understanding, of, the, equivalence, of, constant, velocity, and, rest, were, correct, for, example, if, a, mariner, dropped, a, cannonball, from, the, crow, s, nest, of, a, ship, moving, at, a, constant, velocity, aristotelian, physics, would, have, the, cannonball, fall, straight, down, while, the, ship, moved, beneath, it, thus, in, an, aristotelian, universe, the, falling, cannonball, would, land, behind, the, foot, of, the, mast, of, a, moving, ship, when, this, experiment, is, actually, conducted, the, cannonball, always, falls, at, the, foot, of, the, mast, as, if, the, cannonball, knows, to, travel, with, the, ship, despite, being, separated, from, it, since, there, is, no, forward, horizontal, force, being, applied, on, the, cannonball, as, it, falls, the, only, conclusion, left, is, that, the, cannonball, continues, to, move, with, the, same, velocity, as, the, boat, as, it, falls, thus, no, force, is, required, to, keep, the, cannonball, moving, at, the, constant, forward, velocity, moreover, any, object, traveling, at, a, constant, velocity, must, be, subject, to, zero, net, force, resultant, force, this, is, the, definition, of, dynamic, equilibrium, when, all, the, forces, on, an, object, balance, but, it, still, moves, at, a, constant, velocity, a, simple, case, of, dynamic, equilibrium, occurs, in, constant, velocity, motion, across, a, surface, with, kinetic, friction, in, such, a, situation, a, force, is, applied, in, the, direction, of, motion, while, the, kinetic, friction, force, exactly, opposes, the, applied, force, this, results, in, zero, net, force, but, since, the, object, started, with, a, non, zero, velocity, it, continues, to, move, with, a, non, zero, velocity, aristotle, misinterpreted, this, motion, as, being, caused, by, the, applied, force, when, kinetic, friction, is, taken, into, consideration, it, is, clear, that, there, is, no, net, force, causing, constant, velocity, motion, ch, 12, some, forces, are, consequences, of, the, fundamental, ones, in, such, situations, idealized, models, can, be, used, to, gain, physical, insight, for, example, each, solid, object, is, considered, a, rigid, body, what, we, now, call, gravity, was, not, identified, as, a, universal, force, until, the, work, of, isaac, newton, before, newton, the, tendency, for, objects, to, fall, towards, the, earth, was, not, understood, to, be, related, to, the, motions, of, celestial, objects, galileo, was, instrumental, in, describing, the, characteristics, of, falling, objects, by, determining, that, the, acceleration, of, every, object, in, free, fall, was, constant, and, independent, of, the, mass, of, the, object, today, this, acceleration, due, to, gravity, towards, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, usually, designated, as, g, displaystyle, mathbf, g, and, has, a, magnitude, of, about, 9, 81, meters, per, second, squared, this, measurement, is, taken, from, sea, level, and, may, vary, depending, on, location, and, points, toward, the, center, of, the, earth, this, observation, means, that, the, force, of, gravity, on, an, object, at, the, earth, s, surface, is, directly, proportional, to, the, object, s, mass, thus, an, object, that, has, a, mass, of, m, displaystyle, m, will, experience, a, force, f, m, g, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, g, for, an, object, in, free, fall, this, force, is, unopposed, and, the, net, force, on, the, object, is, its, weight, for, objects, not, in, free, fall, the, force, of, gravity, is, opposed, by, the, reaction, forces, applied, by, their, supports, for, example, a, person, standing, on, the, ground, experiences, zero, net, force, since, a, normal, force, a, reaction, force, is, exerted, by, the, ground, upward, on, the, person, that, counterbalances, his, weight, that, is, directed, downward, ch, 12, newton, s, contribution, to, gravitational, theory, was, to, unify, the, motions, of, heavenly, bodies, which, aristotle, had, assumed, were, in, a, natural, state, of, constant, motion, with, falling, motion, observed, on, the, earth, he, proposed, a, law, of, gravity, that, could, account, for, the, celestial, motions, that, had, been, described, earlier, using, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, newton, came, to, realize, that, the, effects, of, gravity, might, be, observed, in, different, ways, at, larger, distances, in, particular, newton, determined, that, the, acceleration, of, the, moon, around, the, earth, could, be, ascribed, to, the, same, force, of, gravity, if, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, decreased, as, an, inverse, square, law, further, newton, realized, that, the, acceleration, of, a, body, due, to, gravity, is, proportional, to, the, mass, of, the, other, attracting, body, combining, these, ideas, gives, a, formula, that, relates, the, mass, m, displaystyle, m, oplus, and, the, radius, r, displaystyle, r, oplus, of, the, earth, to, the, gravitational, acceleration, g, g, m, r, 2, r, displaystyle, mathbf, g, frac, gm, oplus, r, oplus, 2, hat, mathbf, r, where, the, vector, direction, is, given, by, r, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, r, is, the, unit, vector, directed, outward, from, the, center, of, the, earth, in, this, equation, a, dimensional, constant, g, displaystyle, g, is, used, to, describe, the, relative, strength, of, gravity, this, constant, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, though, its, value, was, unknown, in, newton, s, lifetime, not, until, 1798, was, henry, cavendish, able, to, make, the, first, measurement, of, g, displaystyle, g, using, a, torsion, balance, this, was, widely, reported, in, the, press, as, a, measurement, of, the, mass, of, the, earth, since, knowing, g, displaystyle, g, could, allow, one, to, solve, for, the, earth, s, mass, given, the, above, equation, newton, realized, that, since, all, celestial, bodies, followed, the, same, laws, of, motion, his, law, of, gravity, had, to, be, universal, succinctly, stated, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, states, that, the, force, on, a, spherical, object, of, mass, m, 1, displaystyle, m, 1, due, to, the, gravitational, pull, of, mass, m, 2, displaystyle, m, 2, is, f, g, m, 1, m, 2, r, 2, r, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, gm, 1, m, 2, r, 2, hat, mathbf, r, where, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, distance, between, the, two, objects, centers, of, mass, and, r, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, r, is, the, unit, vector, pointed, in, the, direction, away, from, the, center, of, the, first, object, toward, the, center, of, the, second, object, this, formula, was, powerful, enough, to, stand, as, the, basis, for, all, subsequent, descriptions, of, motion, within, the, solar, system, until, the, 20th, century, during, that, time, sophisticated, methods, of, perturbation, analysis, were, invented, to, calculate, the, deviations, of, orbits, due, to, the, influence, of, multiple, bodies, on, a, planet, moon, comet, or, asteroid, the, formalism, was, exact, enough, to, allow, mathematicians, to, predict, the, existence, of, the, planet, neptune, before, it, was, observed, the, electrostatic, force, was, first, described, in, 1784, by, coulomb, as, a, force, that, existed, intrinsically, between, two, charges, 519, the, properties, of, the, electrostatic, force, were, that, it, varied, as, an, inverse, square, law, directed, in, the, radial, direction, was, both, attractive, and, repulsive, there, was, intrinsic, polarity, was, independent, of, the, mass, of, the, charged, objects, and, followed, the, superposition, principle, coulomb, s, law, unifies, all, these, observations, into, one, succinct, statement, subsequent, mathematicians, and, physicists, found, the, construct, of, the, electric, field, to, be, useful, for, determining, the, electrostatic, force, on, an, electric, charge, at, any, point, in, space, the, electric, field, was, based, on, using, a, hypothetical, test, charge, anywhere, in, space, and, then, using, coulomb, s, law, to, determine, the, electrostatic, force, 4, 6, 4, 8, thus, the, electric, field, anywhere, in, space, is, defined, as, e, f, q, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, f, over, q, where, q, displaystyle, q, is, the, magnitude, of, the, hypothetical, test, charge, similarly, the, idea, of, the, magnetic, field, was, introduced, to, express, how, magnets, can, influence, one, another, at, a, distance, the, lorentz, force, law, gives, the, force, upon, a, body, with, charge, q, displaystyle, q, due, to, electric, and, magnetic, fields, f, q, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, left, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, right, where, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, is, the, electromagnetic, force, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, is, the, electric, field, at, the, body, s, location, b, displaystyle, mathbf, b, is, the, magnetic, field, and, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, is, the, velocity, of, the, particle, the, magnetic, contribution, to, the, lorentz, force, is, the, cross, product, of, the, velocity, vector, with, the, magnetic, field, 482, the, origin, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, would, not, be, fully, explained, until, 1864, when, james, clerk, maxwell, unified, a, number, of, earlier, theories, into, a, set, of, 20, scalar, equations, which, were, later, reformulated, into, 4, vector, equations, by, oliver, heaviside, and, josiah, willard, gibbs, these, maxwell, s, equations, fully, described, the, sources, of, the, fields, as, being, stationary, and, moving, charges, and, the, interactions, of, the, fields, themselves, this, led, maxwell, to, discover, that, electric, and, magnetic, fields, could, be, self, generating, through, a, wave, that, traveled, at, a, speed, that, he, calculated, to, be, the, speed, of, light, this, insight, united, the, nascent, fields, of, electromagnetic, theory, with, optics, and, led, directly, to, a, complete, description, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, when, objects, are, in, contact, the, force, directly, between, them, is, called, the, normal, force, the, component, of, the, total, force, in, the, system, exerted, normal, to, the, interface, between, the, objects, 264, the, normal, force, is, closely, related, to, newton, s, third, law, the, normal, force, for, example, is, responsible, for, the, structural, integrity, of, tables, and, floors, as, well, as, being, the, force, that, responds, whenever, an, external, force, pushes, on, a, solid, object, an, example, of, the, normal, force, in, action, is, the, impact, force, on, an, object, crashing, into, an, immobile, surface, ch, 12, friction, is, a, force, that, opposes, relative, motion, of, two, bodies, at, the, macroscopic, scale, the, frictional, force, is, directly, related, to, the, normal, force, at, the, point, of, contact, there, are, two, broad, classifications, of, frictional, forces, static, friction, and, kinetic, friction, 267, the, static, friction, force, f, s, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathrm, sf, will, exactly, oppose, forces, applied, to, an, object, parallel, to, a, surface, up, to, the, limit, specified, by, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, s, f, displaystyle, mu, mathrm, sf, multiplied, by, the, normal, force, f, n, displaystyle, mathbf, f, text, n, in, other, words, the, magnitude, of, the, static, friction, force, satisfies, the, inequality, 0, f, s, f, s, f, f, n, displaystyle, 0, leq, mathbf, f, mathrm, sf, leq, mu, mathrm, sf, mathbf, f, mathrm, n, the, kinetic, friction, force, f, k, f, displaystyle, f, mathrm, kf, is, typically, independent, of, both, the, forces, applied, and, the, movement, of, the, object, thus, the, magnitude, of, the, force, equals, f, k, f, k, f, f, n, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathrm, kf, mu, mathrm, kf, mathbf, f, mathrm, n, where, k, f, displaystyle, mu, mathrm, kf, is, the, coefficient, of, kinetic, friction, the, coefficient, of, kinetic, friction, is, normally, less, than, the, coefficient, of, static, friction, 267, 271, tension, forces, can, be, modeled, using, ideal, strings, that, are, massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and, do, not, stretch, they, can, be, combined, with, ideal, pulleys, which, allow, ideal, strings, to, switch, physical, direction, ideal, strings, transmit, tension, forces, instantaneously, in, action, reaction, pairs, so, that, if, two, objects, are, connected, by, an, ideal, string, any, force, directed, along, the, string, by, the, first, object, is, accompanied, by, a, force, directed, along, the, string, in, the, opposite, direction, by, the, second, object, by, connecting, the, same, string, multiple, times, to, the, same, object, through, the, use, of, a, configuration, that, uses, movable, pulleys, the, tension, force, on, a, load, can, be, multiplied, for, every, string, that, acts, on, a, load, another, factor, of, the, tension, force, in, the, string, acts, on, the, load, such, machines, allow, a, mechanical, advantage, for, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, length, of, displaced, string, needed, to, move, the, load, these, tandem, effects, result, ultimately, in, the, conservation, of, mechanical, energy, since, the, work, done, on, the, load, is, the, same, no, matter, how, complicated, the, machine, ch, 12, a, simple, elastic, force, acts, to, return, a, spring, to, its, natural, length, an, ideal, spring, is, taken, to, be, massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and, infinitely, stretchable, such, springs, exert, forces, that, push, when, contracted, or, pull, when, extended, in, proportion, to, the, displacement, of, the, spring, from, its, equilibrium, position, this, linear, relationship, was, described, by, robert, hooke, in, 1676, for, whom, hooke, s, law, is, named, if, x, displaystyle, delta, x, is, the, displacement, the, force, exerted, by, an, ideal, spring, equals, f, k, x, displaystyle, mathbf, f, k, delta, mathbf, x, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, the, spring, constant, or, force, constant, which, is, particular, to, the, spring, the, minus, sign, accounts, for, the, tendency, of, the, force, to, act, in, opposition, to, the, applied, load, ch, 12, for, an, object, in, uniform, circular, motion, the, net, force, acting, on, the, object, equals, f, m, v, 2, r, r, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, mv, 2, r, hat, mathbf, r, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, object, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, velocity, of, the, object, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, distance, to, the, center, of, the, circular, path, and, r, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, r, is, the, unit, vector, pointing, in, the, radial, direction, outwards, from, the, center, this, means, that, the, net, force, felt, by, the, object, is, always, directed, toward, the, center, of, the, curving, path, such, forces, act, perpendicular, to, the, velocity, vector, associated, with, the, motion, of, an, object, and, therefore, do, not, change, the, speed, of, the, object, magnitude, of, the, velocity, but, only, the, direction, of, the, velocity, vector, more, generally, the, net, force, that, accelerates, an, object, can, be, resolved, into, a, component, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, path, and, one, that, is, tangential, to, the, path, this, yields, both, the, tangential, force, which, accelerates, the, object, by, either, slowing, it, down, or, speeding, it, up, and, the, radial, centripetal, force, which, changes, its, direction, ch, 12, newton, s, laws, and, newtonian, mechanics, in, general, were, first, developed, to, describe, how, forces, affect, idealized, point, particles, rather, than, three, dimensional, objects, in, real, life, matter, has, extended, structure, and, forces, that, act, on, one, part, of, an, object, might, affect, other, parts, of, an, object, for, situations, where, lattice, holding, together, the, atoms, in, an, object, is, able, to, flow, contract, expand, or, otherwise, change, shape, the, theories, of, continuum, mechanics, describe, the, way, forces, affect, the, material, for, example, in, extended, fluids, differences, in, pressure, result, in, forces, being, directed, along, the, pressure, gradients, as, follows, f, v, p, displaystyle, frac, mathbf, f, v, mathbf, nabla, p, where, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, volume, of, the, object, in, the, fluid, and, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, scalar, function, that, describes, the, pressure, at, all, locations, in, space, pressure, gradients, and, differentials, result, in, the, buoyant, force, for, fluids, suspended, in, gravitational, fields, winds, in, atmospheric, science, and, the, lift, associated, with, aerodynamics, and, flight, ch, 12, a, specific, instance, of, such, a, force, that, is, associated, with, dynamic, pressure, is, fluid, resistance, a, body, force, that, resists, the, motion, of, an, object, through, a, fluid, due, to, viscosity, for, so, called, stokes, drag, the, force, is, approximately, proportional, to, the, velocity, but, opposite, in, direction, f, d, b, v, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathrm, d, b, mathbf, v, where, more, formally, forces, in, continuum, mechanics, are, fully, described, by, a, stress, tensor, with, terms, that, are, roughly, defined, as, f, a, displaystyle, sigma, frac, f, a, where, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, relevant, cross, sectional, area, for, the, volume, for, which, the, stress, tensor, is, being, calculated, this, formalism, includes, pressure, terms, associated, with, forces, that, act, normal, to, the, cross, sectional, area, the, matrix, diagonals, of, the, tensor, as, well, as, shear, terms, associated, with, forces, that, act, parallel, to, the, cross, sectional, area, the, off, diagonal, elements, the, stress, tensor, accounts, for, forces, that, cause, all, strains, deformations, including, also, tensile, stresses, and, compressions, 133, 134, 38, 1, 38, 11, there, are, forces, that, are, frame, dependent, meaning, that, they, appear, due, to, the, adoption, of, non, newtonian, that, is, non, inertial, reference, frames, such, forces, include, the, centrifugal, force, and, the, coriolis, force, these, forces, are, considered, fictitious, because, they, do, not, exist, in, frames, of, reference, that, are, not, accelerating, ch, 12, because, these, forces, are, not, genuine, they, are, also, referred, to, as, pseudo, forces, 12, 11, in, general, relativity, gravity, becomes, a, fictitious, force, that, arises, in, situations, where, spacetime, deviates, from, a, flat, geometry, forces, that, cause, extended, objects, to, rotate, are, associated, with, torques, mathematically, the, torque, of, a, force, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, is, defined, relative, to, an, arbitrary, reference, point, as, the, cross, product, r, f, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, where, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, is, the, position, vector, of, the, force, application, point, relative, to, the, reference, point, 497, torque, is, the, rotation, equivalent, of, force, in, the, same, way, that, angle, is, the, rotational, equivalent, for, position, angular, velocity, for, velocity, and, angular, momentum, for, momentum, as, a, consequence, of, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, there, exists, rotational, inertia, that, ensures, that, all, bodies, maintain, their, angular, momentum, unless, acted, upon, by, an, unbalanced, torque, likewise, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, can, be, used, to, derive, an, analogous, equation, for, the, instantaneous, angular, acceleration, of, the, rigid, body, i, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, i, boldsymbol, alpha, where, this, provides, a, definition, for, the, moment, of, inertia, which, is, the, rotational, equivalent, for, mass, in, more, advanced, treatments, of, mechanics, where, the, rotation, over, a, time, interval, is, described, the, moment, of, inertia, must, be, substituted, by, the, tensor, that, when, properly, analyzed, fully, determines, the, characteristics, of, rotations, including, precession, and, nutation, 96, 113, equivalently, the, differential, form, of, newton, s, second, law, provides, an, alternative, definition, of, torque, d, l, d, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, l, mathrm, dt, where, l, displaystyle, mathbf, l, is, the, angular, momentum, of, the, particle, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, requires, that, all, objects, exerting, torques, themselves, experience, equal, and, opposite, torques, and, therefore, also, directly, implies, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, for, closed, systems, that, experience, rotations, and, revolutions, through, the, action, of, internal, torques, the, yank, is, defined, as, the, rate, of, change, of, force, 131, the, term, is, used, in, biomechanical, analysis, athletic, assessment, and, robotic, control, the, second, tug, third, snatch, fourth, shake, and, higher, derivatives, are, rarely, used, forces, can, be, used, to, define, a, number, of, physical, concepts, by, integrating, with, respect, to, kinematic, variables, for, example, integrating, with, respect, to, time, gives, the, definition, of, impulse, j, t, 1, t, 2, f, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, j, int, t, 1, t, 2, mathbf, f, mathrm, d, t, which, by, newton, s, second, law, must, be, equivalent, to, the, change, in, momentum, yielding, the, impulse, momentum, theorem, similarly, integrating, with, respect, to, position, gives, a, definition, for, the, work, done, by, a, force, 13, 3, w, x, 1, x, 2, f, d, x, displaystyle, w, int, mathbf, x, 1, mathbf, x, 2, mathbf, f, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, x, which, is, equivalent, to, changes, in, kinetic, energy, yielding, the, work,

energy, field, is, used, for, instance, the, gravitational, force, acting, upon, an, object, can, be, seen, as, the, action, of, the, gravitational, field, that, is, present, at, the, object, s, location, restating, mathematically, the, definition, of, energy, via, the, definition, of, work, a, potential, scalar, field, u, r, displaystyle, u, mathbf, r, is, defined, as, that, field, whose, gradient, is, equal, and, opposite, to, the, force, produced, at, every, point, f, u, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathbf, nabla, u, forces, can, be, classified, as, conservative, or, nonconservative, conservative, forces, are, equivalent, to, the, gradient, of, a, potential, while, nonconservative, forces, are, not, ch, 12, a, conservative, force, that, acts, on, a, closed, system, has, an, associated, mechanical, work, that, allows, energy, to, convert, only, between, kinetic, or, potential, forms, this, means, that, for, a, closed, system, the, net, mechanical, energy, is, conserved, whenever, a, conservative, force, acts, on, the, system, the, force, therefore, is, related, directly, to, the, difference, in, potential, energy, between, two, different, locations, in, space, and, can, be, considered, to, be, an, artifact, of, the, potential, field, in, the, same, way, that, the, direction, and, amount, of, a, flow, of, water, can, be, considered, to, be, an, artifact, of, the, contour, map, of, the, elevation, of, an, area, ch, 12, conservative, forces, include, gravity, the, electromagnetic, force, and, the, spring, force, each, of, these, forces, has, models, that, are, dependent, on, a, position, often, given, as, a, radial, vector, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, emanating, from, spherically, symmetric, potentials, examples, of, this, follow, for, gravity, f, g, g, m,

of, potentials, this, is, often, due, a, macroscopic, statistical, average, of, microstates, for, example, static, friction, is, caused, by, the, gradients, of, numerous, electrostatic, potentials, between, the, atoms, but, manifests, as, a, force, model, that, is, independent, of, any, macroscale, position, vector, nonconservative, forces, other, than, friction, include, other, contact, forces, tension, compression, and, drag, for, any, sufficiently, detailed, description, all, these, forces, are, the, results, of, conservative, ones, since, each, of, these, macroscopic, forces, are, the, net, results, of, the, gradients, of, microscopic, potentials, ch, 12, the, connection, between, macroscopic, nonconservative, forces, and, microscopic, conservative, forces, is, described, by, detailed, treatment, with, statistical, mechanics, in, macroscopic, closed, systems, nonconservative, forces, act, to, change, the, internal, energies, of, the, system, and, are, often, associated, with, the, transfer, of, heat, according, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, nonconservative, forces, necessarily, result, in, energy, transformations, within, closed, systems, from, ordered, to, more, random, conditions, as, entropy, increases, ch, 12, the, si, unit, of, force, is, the, newton, symbol, n, which, is, the, force, required, to, accelerate, a, one, kilogram, mass, at, a, rate, of, one, meter, per, second, squared, or, kg, m, s, 2, the, corresponding, cgs, unit, is, the, dyne, the, force, required, to, accelerate, a, one, gram, mass, by, one, centimeter, per, second, squared, or, g, cm, s, 2, a, newton, is, thus, equal, to, 100, 000, dynes, the, gravitational, foot, pound, second, english, unit, of, force, is, the, pound, force, lbf, defined, as, the, force, exerted, by, gravity, on, a, pound, mass, in, the, standard, gravitational, field, of, 9, 80665, m, s, 2, the, pound, force, provides, an, alternative, unit, of, mass, one, slug, is, the, mass, that, will, accelerate, by, one, foot, per, second, squared, when, acted, on, by, one, pound, force, an, alternative, unit, of, force, in, a, different, foot, pound, second, system, the, absolute, fps, system, is, the, poundal, defined, as, the, force, required, to, accelerate, a, one, pound, mass, at, a, rate, of, one, foot, per, second, squared, the, pound, force, has, a, metric, counterpart, less, commonly, used, than, the, newton, the, kilogram, force, kgf, sometimes, kilopond, is, the, force, exerted, by, standard, gravity, on, one, kilogram, of, mass, the, kilogram, force, leads, to, an, alternate, but, rarely, used, unit, of, mass, the, metric, slug, sometimes, mug, or, hyl, is, that, mass, that, accelerates, at, 1, m, s, 2, when, subjected, to, a, force, of, 1, kgf, the, kilogram, force, is, not, a, part, of, the, modern, si, system, and, is, generally, deprecated, sometimes, used, for, expressing, aircraft, weight, jet, thrust, bicycle, spoke, tension, torque, wrench, settings, and, engine, output, torque, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, new, physical, ideas, emerged, to, explain, experimental, results, in, astronomical, and, submicroscopic, realms, as, discussed, below, relativity, alters, the, definition, of, momentum, and, quantum, mechanics, reuses, the, concept, of, force, in, microscopic, contexts, where, newton, s, laws, do, not, apply, directly, in, the, special, theory, of, relativity, mass, and, energy, are, equivalent, as, can, be, seen, by, calculating, the, work, required, to, accelerate, an, object, when, an, object, s, velocity, increases, so, does, its, energy, and, hence, its, mass, equivalent, inertia, it, thus, requires, more, force, to, accelerate, it, the, same, amount, than, it, did, at, a, lower, velocity,

non, zero, rest, mass, m, displaystyle, m, moving, in, the, x, displaystyle, x, direction, at, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, is, 216, f, 3, m, a, x, m, a, y, m, a, z, displaystyle, mathbf, f, left,

steeply, as, the, relative, velocity, approaches, the, speed, of, light, consequently, the, greater, and, greater, force, must, be, applied, to, produce, the, same, acceleration, at, extreme,

to, 1, and, f, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, a, is, a, close, approximation, even, for, use, in, relativity, one, can, restore, the, form, of, f, m, a, displaystyle, f, mu, ma, mu, through, the, use, of, four, vectors, this, relation, is, correct, in, relativity, when, f, displaystyle, f, mu, is, the, four, force, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, invariant, mass, and, a, displaystyle, a, mu, is, the, four, acceleration, the, general, theory, of, relativity, incorporates, a, more, radical, departure, from, the, newtonian, way, of, thinking, about, force, specifically, gravitational, force, this, reimagining, of, the, nature, of, gravity, is, described, more, fully, below, quantum, mechanics, is, a, theory, of, physics, originally, developed, in, order, to, understand, microscopic, phenomena, behavior, at, the, scale, of, molecules, atoms, or, subatomic, particles, generally, and, loosely, speaking, the, smaller, a, system, is, the, more, an, adequate, mathematical, model, will, require, understanding, quantum, effects, the, conceptual, underpinning, of, quantum, physics, is, different, from, that, of, classical, physics, instead, of, thinking, about, quantities, like, position, momentum, and, energy, as, properties, that, an, object, has, one, considers, what, result, might, appear, when, a, measurement, of, a, chosen, type, is, performed, quantum, mechanics, allows, the, physicist, to, calculate, the, probability, that, a, chosen, measurement, will, elicit, a, particular, result, the, expectation, value, for, a, measurement, is, the, average, of, the, possible, results, it, might, yield, weighted, by, their, probabilities, of, occurrence, in, quantum, mechanics, interactions, are, typically, described, in, terms, of, energy, rather, than, force, the, ehrenfest, theorem, provides, a, connection, between, quantum, expectation, values, and, the, classical, concept, of, force, a, connection, that, is, necessarily, inexact, as, quantum, physics, is, fundamentally, different, from, classical, in, quantum, physics, the, born, rule, is, used, to, calculate, the, expectation, values, of, a, position, measurement, or, a, momentum, measurement, these, expectation, values, will, generally, change, over, time, that, is, depending, on, the, time, at, which, for, example, a, position, measurement, is, performed, the, probabilities, for, its, different, possible, outcomes, will, vary, the, ehrenfest, theorem, says, roughly, speaking, that, the, equations, describing, how, these, expectation, values, change, over, time, have, a, form, reminiscent, of, newton, s, second, law, with, a, force, defined, as, the, negative, derivative, of, the, potential, energy, however, the, more, pronounced, quantum, effects, are, in, a, given, situation, the, more, difficult, it, is, to, derive, meaningful, conclusions, from, this, resemblance, quantum, mechanics, also, introduces, two, new, constraints, that, interact, with, forces, at, the, submicroscopic, scale, and, which, are, especially, important, for, atoms, despite, the, strong, attraction, of, the, nucleus, the, uncertainty, principle, limits, the, minimum, extent, of, an, electron, probability, distribution, and, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, prevents, electrons, from, sharing, the, same, probability, distribution, this, gives, rise, to, an, emergent, pressure, known, as, degeneracy, pressure, the, dynamic, equilibrium, between, the, degeneracy, pressure, and, the, attractive, electromagnetic, force, give, atoms, molecules, liquids, and, solids, stability, in, modern, particle, physics, forces, and, the, acceleration, of, particles, are, explained, as, a, mathematical, by, product, of, exchange, of, momentum, carrying, gauge, bosons, with, the, development, of, quantum, field, theory, and, general, relativity, it, was, realized, that, force, is, a, redundant, concept, arising, from, conservation, of, momentum, 4, momentum, in, relativity, and, momentum, of, virtual, particles, in, quantum, electrodynamics, the, conservation, of, momentum, can, be, directly, derived, from, the, homogeneity, or, symmetry, of, space, and, so, is, usually, considered, more, fundamental, than, the, concept, of, a, force, thus, the, currently, known, fundamental, forces, are, considered, more, accurately, to, be, fundamental, interactions, 199, 128, while, sophisticated, mathematical, descriptions, are, needed, to, predict, in, full, detail, the, result, of, such, interactions, there, is, a, conceptually, simple, way, to, describe, them, through, the, use, of, feynman, diagrams, in, a, feynman, diagram, each, matter, particle, is, represented, as, a, straight, line, see, world, line, traveling, through, time, which, normally, increases, up, or, to, the, right, in, the, diagram, matter, and, anti, matter, particles, are, identical, except, for, their, direction, of, propagation, through, the, feynman, diagram, world, lines, of, particles, intersect, at, interaction, vertices, and, the, feynman, diagram, represents, any, force, arising, from, an, interaction, as, occurring, at, the, vertex, with, an, associated, instantaneous, change, in, the, direction, of, the, particle, world, lines, gauge, bosons, are, emitted, away, from, the, vertex, as, wavy, lines, and, in, the, case, of, virtual, particle, exchange, are, absorbed, at, an, adjacent, vertex, the, utility, of, feynman, diagrams, is, that, other, types, of, physical, phenomena, that, are, part, of, the, general, picture, of, fundamental, interactions, but, are, conceptually, separate, from, forces, can, also, be, described, using, the, same, rules, for, example, a, feynman, diagram, can, describe, in, succinct, detail, how, a, neutron, decays, into, an, electron, proton, and, antineutrino, an, interaction, mediated, by, the, same, gauge, boson, that, is, responsible, for, the, weak, nuclear, force, all, of, the, known, forces, of, the, universe, are, classified, into, four, fundamental, interactions, the, strong, and, the, weak, forces, act, only, at, very, short, distances, and, are, responsible, for, the, interactions, between, subatomic, particles, including, nucleons, and, compound, nuclei, the, electromagnetic, force, acts, between, electric, charges, and, the, gravitational, force, acts, between, masses, all, other, forces, in, nature, derive, from, these, four, fundamental, interactions, operating, within, quantum, mechanics, including, the, constraints, introduced, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, for, example, friction, is, a, manifestation, of, the, electromagnetic, force, acting, between, atoms, of, two, surfaces, the, forces, in, springs, modeled, by, hooke, s, law, are, also, the, result, of, electromagnetic, forces, centrifugal, forces, are, acceleration, forces, that, arise, simply, from, the, acceleration, of, rotating, frames, of, reference, 12, 11, 359, the, fundamental, theories, for, forces, developed, from, the, unification, of, different, ideas, for, example, newton, s, universal, theory, of, gravitation, showed, that, the, force, responsible, for, objects, falling, near, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, also, the, force, responsible, for, the, falling, of, celestial, bodies, about, the, earth, the, moon, and, around, the, sun, the, planets, michael, faraday, and, james, clerk, maxwell, demonstrated, that, electric, and, magnetic, forces, were, unified, through, a, theory, of, electromagnetism, in, the, 20th, century, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, led, to, a, modern, understanding, that, the, first, three, fundamental, forces, all, except, gravity, are, manifestations, of, matter, fermions, interacting, by, exchanging, virtual, particles, called, gauge, bosons, this, standard, model, of, particle, physics, assumes, a, similarity, between, the, forces, and, led, scientists, to, predict, the, unification, of, the, weak, and, electromagnetic, forces, in, electroweak, theory, which, was, subsequently, confirmed, by, observation, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, is, an, example, of, action, at, a, distance, one, body, like, the, sun, exerts, an, influence, upon, any, other, body, like, the, earth, no, matter, how, far, apart, they, are, moreover, this, action, at, a, distance, is, instantaneous, according, to, newton, s, theory, the, one, body, shifting, position, changes, the, gravitational, pulls, felt, by, all, other, bodies, all, at, the, same, instant, of, time, albert, einstein, recognized, that, this, was, inconsistent, with, special, relativity, and, its, prediction, that, influences, cannot, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, so, he, sought, a, new, theory, of, gravitation, that, would, be, relativistically, consistent, mercury, s, orbit, did, not, match, that, predicted, by, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, some, astrophysicists, predicted, the, existence, of, an, undiscovered, planet, vulcan, that, could, explain, the, discrepancies, when, einstein, formulated, his, theory, of, general, relativity, gr, he, focused, on, mercury, s, problematic, orbit, and, found, that, his, theory, added, a, correction, which, could, account, for, the, discrepancy, this, was, the, first, time, that, newton, s, theory, of, gravity, had, been, shown, to, be, inexact, since, then, general, relativity, has, been, acknowledged, as, the, theory, that, best, explains, gravity, in, gr, gravitation, is, not, viewed, as, a, force, but, rather, objects, moving, freely, in, gravitational, fields, travel, under, their, own, inertia, in, straight, lines, through, curved, spacetime, defined, as, the, shortest, spacetime, path, between, two, spacetime, events, from, the, perspective, of, the, object, all, motion, occurs, as, if, there, were, no, gravitation, whatsoever, it, is, only, when, observing, the, motion, in, a, global, sense, that, the, curvature, of, spacetime, can, be, observed, and, the, force, is, inferred, from, the, object, s, curved, path, thus, the, straight, line, path, in, spacetime, is, seen, as, a, curved, line, in, space, and, it, is, called, the, ballistic, trajectory, of, the, object, for, example, a, basketball, thrown, from, the, ground, moves, in, a, parabola, as, it, is, in, a, uniform, gravitational, field, its, spacetime, trajectory, is, almost, a, straight, line, slightly, curved, with, the, radius, of, curvature, of, the, order, of, few, light, years, the, time, derivative, of, the, changing, momentum, of, the, object, is, what, we, label, as, gravitational, force, maxwell, s, equations, and, the, set, of, techniques, built, around, them, adequately, describe, a, wide, range, of, physics, involving, force, in, electricity, and, magnetism, this, classical, theory, already, includes, relativity, effects, understanding, quantized, electromagnetic, interactions, between, elementary, particles, requires, quantum, electrodynamics, or, qed, in, qed, photons, are, fundamental, exchange, particles, describing, all, interactions, relating, to, electromagnetism, including, the, electromagnetic, force, there, are, two, nuclear, forces, which, today, are, usually, described, as, interactions, that, take, place, in, quantum, theories, of, particle, physics, the, strong, nuclear, force, is, the, force, responsible, for, the, structural, integrity, of, atomic, nuclei, and, gains, its, name, from, its, ability, to, overpower, the, electromagnetic, repulsion, between, protons, 940, the, strong, force, is, today, understood, to, represent, the, interactions, between, quarks, and, gluons, as, detailed, by, the, theory, of, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, the, strong, force, is, the, fundamental, force, mediated, by, gluons, acting, upon, quarks, antiquarks, and, the, gluons, themselves, the, strong, force, only, acts, directly, upon, elementary, particles, a, residual, is, observed, between, hadrons, notably, the, nucleons, in, atomic, nuclei, known, as, the, nuclear, force, here, the, strong, force, acts, indirectly, transmitted, as, gluons, that, form, part, of, the, virtual, pi, and, rho, mesons, the, classical, transmitters, of, the, nuclear, force, the, failure, of, many, searches, for, free, quarks, has, shown, that, the, elementary, particles, affected, are, not, directly, observable, this, phenomenon, is, called, color, confinement, 232, unique, among, the, fundamental, interactions, the, weak, nuclear, force, creates, no, bound, states, the, weak, force, is, due, to, the, exchange, of, the, heavy, w, and, z, bosons, since, the, weak, force, is, mediated, by, two, types, of, bosons, it, can, be, divided, into, two, types, of, interaction, or, vertices, charged, current, involving, the, electrically, charged, w, and, w, bosons, and, neutral, current, involving, electrically, neutral, z, 0, bosons, the, most, familiar, effect, of, weak, interaction, is, beta, decay, of, neutrons, in, atomic, nuclei, and, the, associated, radioactivity, 951, this, is, a, type, of, charged, current, interaction, the, word, weak, derives, from, the, fact, that, the, field, strength, is, some, 10, 13, times, less, than, that, of, the, strong, force, still, it, is, stronger, than, gravity, over, short, distances, a, consistent, electroweak, theory, has, also, been, developed, which, shows, that, electromagnetic, forces, and, the, weak, force, are, indistinguishable, at, a, temperatures, in, excess, of, approximately, 10, 15, k, such, temperatures, occurred, in, the, plasma, collisions, in, the, early, moments, of, the, big, bang, 201
