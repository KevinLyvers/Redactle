the, great, attractor, is, a, region, of, gravitational, attraction, in, intergalactic, space, and, the, apparent, central, gravitational, point, of, the, laniakea, supercluster, of, galaxies, that, includes, the, milky, way, galaxy, as, well, as, about, 100, 000, other, galaxies, the, observed, attraction, suggests, a, localized, concentration, of, mass, having, the, order, of, 10, 16, solar, masses, however, it, is, obscured, by, the, milky, way, s, galactic, plane, lying, behind, the, zone, of, avoidance, zoa, so, that, in, visible, light, wavelengths, the, great, attractor, is, difficult, to, observe, directly, the, attraction, is, observable, by, its, effect, on, the, motion, of, galaxies, and, their, associated, clusters, over, a, region, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, light, years, across, the, universe, these, galaxies, are, observable, above, and, below, the, zone, of, avoidance, all, are, redshifted, in, accordance, with, the, hubble, flow, indicating, that, they, are, receding, relative, to, the, milky, way, and, to, each, other, but, the, variations, in, their, redshifts, are, large, enough, and, regular, enough, to, reveal, that, they, are, slightly, drawn, towards, the, attraction, the, variations, in, their, redshifts, are, known, as, peculiar, velocities, and, cover, a, range, from, about, 700, km, s, to, 700, km, s, depending, on, the, angular, deviation, from, the, direction, to, the, great, attractor, the, great, attractor, itself, is, moving, towards, the, shapley, supercluster, the, great, attractor, was, named, by, alan, dressler, in, 1987, following, decades, of, redshift, surveys, that, built, up, a, large, dataset, of, redshift, values, the, redshift, values, and, distance, measurements, independent, of, redshift, measurements, were, then, combined, to, create, maps, of, peculiar, velocity, 274, through, a, series, of, peculiar, velocity, tests, astrophysicists, found, that, the, milky, way, was, moving, in, the, direction, of, the, constellation, of, centaurus, at, about, 600, km, s, then, the, discovery, of, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, dipoles, was, used, to, reflect, the, motion, of, the, local, group, of, galaxies, towards, the, great, attractor, the, 1980s, brought, many, discoveries, about, the, great, attractor, such, as, the, fact, that, the, milky, way, is, not, the, only, galaxy, impacted, approximately, 400, elliptical, galaxies, are, moving, toward, the, great, attractor, beyond, the, zone, of, avoidance, caused, by, the, milky, way, galaxy, light, intense, efforts, to, work, through, the, difficulties, caused, by, the, occlusion, by, the, milky, way, during, the, late, 1990, s, identified, the, norma, cluster, at, the, center, of, the, great, attractor, region, the, first, indications, of, a, deviation, from, uniform, expansion, of, the, universe, were, reported, in, 1973, and, again, in, 1978, the, location, of, the, great, attractor, was, finally, determined, in, 1986, it, is, situated, at, a, distance, of, somewhere, between, 150, and, 250, mly, million, light, years, 47, 79, mpc, the, larger, being, the, most, recent, estimate, away, from, the, milky, way, in, the, direction, of, the, constellations, triangulum, australe, the, southern, triangle, and, norma, the, carpenter, s, square, while, objects, in, that, direction, lie, in, the, zone, of, avoidance, the, part, of, the, night, sky, obscured, by, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, are, thus, difficult, to, study, with, visible, wavelengths, x, ray, observations, have, revealed, that, region, of, space, to, be, dominated, by, the, norma, cluster, aco, 3627, a, massive, cluster, of, galaxies, containing, a, preponderance, of, large, old, galaxies, many, of, which, are, colliding, with, their, neighbours, and, radiating, large, amounts, of, radio, waves, in, 1992, much, of, the, apparent, signal, of, the, great, attractor, was, attributed, to, a, statistical, effect, called, malmquist, bias, in, 2005, astronomers, conducting, an, x, ray, survey, of, part, of, the, sky, known, as, the, clusters, in, the, zone, of, avoidance, ciza, project, reported, that, the, great, attractor, was, actually, only, one, tenth, the, mass, that, scientists, had, originally, estimated, the, survey, also, confirmed, earlier, theories, that, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, in, fact, being, pulled, toward, a, much, more, massive, cluster, of, galaxies, near, the, shapley, supercluster, which, lies, beyond, the, great, attractor, and, which, is, called, the, shapley, attractor, a, massive, galaxy, filament, called, the, norma, wall, also, called, great, attractor, wall, is, located, at, the, center, of, the, supposed, position, of, the, great, attractor, the, norma, wall, contains, the, clusters, pavo, ii, norma, centaurus, crux, and, ciza, j1324, 7, 5736, the, most, massive, cluster, in, this, region, is, the, norma, supercluster, later, studies, found, that, the, wall, continues, over, to, the, constellations, of, centaurus, and, vela, the, proposed, laniakea, supercluster, is, defined, as, the, great, attractor, s, basin, it, covers, approximately, four, main, galaxy, superclusters, including, superclusters, of, virgo, and, hydra, centaurus, and, spans, across, 500, million, light, years, because, it, is, not, dense, enough, to, be, gravitationally, bound, it, should, be, dispersing, as, the, universe, expands, but, it, is, instead, anchored, by, a, gravitational, focal, point, thus, the, great, attractor, would, be, the, core, of, the, new, supercluster, the, local, flows, of, the, laniakea, supercluster, converge, in, the, region, of, the, norma, and, centaurus, clusters, approximately, at, the, position, of, the, great, attractor
