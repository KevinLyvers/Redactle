a, pond, is, a, small, still, land, based, body, of, water, formed, by, pooling, inside, a, depression, either, naturally, or, artificially, a, pond, is, smaller, than, a, lake, and, there, are, no, official, criteria, distinguishing, the, two, although, defining, a, pond, to, be, less, than, 5, hectares, 12, acres, in, area, less, than, 5, metres, 16, ft, in, depth, and, with, less, than, 30, with, emergent, vegetation, helps, in, distinguishing, the, ecology, of, ponds, from, those, of, lakes, and, wetlands, 460, ponds, can, be, created, by, a, wide, variety, of, natural, processes, e, g, on, floodplains, as, cutoff, river, channels, by, glacial, processes, by, peatland, formation, in, coastal, dune, systems, by, beavers, or, they, can, simply, be, isolated, depressions, such, as, a, kettle, hole, vernal, pool, prairie, pothole, or, simply, natural, undulations, in, undrained, land, filled, by, runoff, groundwater, or, precipitation, or, all, three, of, these, they, can, be, further, divided, into, four, zones, vegetation, zone, open, water, bottom, mud, and, surface, film, 160, 163, the, size, and, depth, of, ponds, often, varies, greatly, with, the, time, of, year, many, ponds, are, produced, by, spring, flooding, from, rivers, ponds, are, usually, freshwater, but, may, be, brackish, in, nature, saltwater, pools, with, a, direct, connection, to, the, sea, to, maintain, full, salinity, may, sometimes, be, called, ponds, but, these, are, normally, regarded, as, part, of, the, marine, environment, they, do, not, support, fresh, or, brackish, water, based, organisms, and, are, rather, tidal, pools, or, lagoons, ponds, are, typically, shallow, water, bodies, with, varying, abundances, of, aquatic, plants, and, animals, depth, seasonal, water, level, variations, nutrient, fluxes, amount, of, light, reaching, the, ponds, the, shape, the, presence, of, visiting, large, mammals, the, composition, of, any, fish, communities, and, salinity, can, all, affect, the, types, of, plant, and, animal, communities, present, food, webs, are, based, both, on, free, floating, algae, and, upon, aquatic, plants, there, is, usually, a, diverse, array, of, aquatic, life, with, a, few, examples, including, algae, snails, fish, beetles, water, bugs, frogs, turtles, otters, and, muskrats, top, predators, may, include, large, fish, herons, or, alligators, since, fish, are, a, major, predator, upon, amphibian, larvae, ponds, that, dry, up, each, year, thereby, killing, resident, fish, provide, important, refugia, for, amphibian, breeding, ponds, that, dry, up, completely, each, year, are, often, known, as, vernal, pools, some, ponds, are, produced, by, animal, activity, including, alligator, holes, and, beaver, ponds, and, these, add, important, diversity, to, landscapes, ponds, are, frequently, man, made, or, expanded, beyond, their, original, depths, and, bounds, by, anthropogenic, causes, apart, from, their, role, as, highly, biodiverse, fundamentally, natural, freshwater, ecosystems, ponds, have, had, and, still, have, many, uses, including, providing, water, for, agriculture, livestock, and, communities, aiding, in, habitat, restoration, serving, as, breeding, grounds, for, local, and, migrating, species, decorative, components, of, landscape, architecture, flood, control, basins, general, urbanization, interception, basins, for, pollutants, and, sources, and, sinks, of, greenhouse, gases, the, technical, distinction, between, a, pond, and, a, lake, has, not, been, universally, standardized, limnologists, and, freshwater, biologists, have, proposed, formal, definitions, for, pond, in, part, to, include, bodies, of, water, where, light, penetrates, to, the, bottom, of, the, waterbody, bodies, of, water, shallow, enough, for, rooted, water, plants, to, grow, throughout, and, bodies, of, water, which, lack, wave, action, on, the, shoreline, each, of, these, definitions, are, difficult, to, measure, or, verify, in, practice, and, are, of, limited, practical, use, and, are, mostly, not, now, used, accordingly, some, organizations, and, researchers, have, settled, on, technical, definitions, of, pond, and, lake, that, rely, on, size, alone, some, regions, of, the, united, states, define, a, pond, as, a, body, of, water, with, a, surface, area, of, less, than, 10, acres, 4, 0, ha, minnesota, known, as, the, land, of, 10, 000, lakes, is, commonly, said, to, distinguish, lakes, from, ponds, bogs, and, other, water, features, by, this, definition, but, also, says, that, a, lake, is, distinguished, primarily, by, wave, action, reaching, the, shore, even, among, organizations, and, researchers, who, distinguish, lakes, from, ponds, by, size, alone, there, is, no, universally, recognized, standard, for, the, maximum, size, of, a, pond, the, international, ramsar, wetland, convention, sets, the, upper, limit, for, pond, size, as, 8, hectares, 80, 000, m, 2, 20, acres, researchers, for, the, british, charity, pond, conservation, now, called, freshwater, habitats, trust, have, defined, a, pond, to, be, a, man, made, or, natural, waterbody, that, is, between, 1, m, 2, 0, 00010, hectares, 0, 00025, acres, and, 20, 000, m, 2, 2, 0, hectares, 4, 9, acres, in, area, which, holds, water, for, four, months, of, the, year, or, more, other, european, biologists, have, set, the, upper, size, limit, at, 5, hectares, 50, 000, m, 2, 12, acres, in, north, america, even, larger, bodies, of, water, have, been, called, ponds, for, example, crystal, lake, at, 33, acres, 130, 000, m, 2, 13, ha, walden, pond, in, concord, massachusetts, at, 61, acres, 250, 000, m, 2, 25, ha, and, nearby, spot, pond, at, 340, acres, 140, ha, there, are, numerous, examples, in, other, states, where, bodies, of, water, less, than, 10, acres, 40, 000, m, 2, 4, 0, ha, are, being, called, lakes, as, the, case, of, crystal, lake, shows, marketing, purposes, can, sometimes, be, the, driving, factor, behind, the, categorization, in, practice, a, body, of, water, is, called, a, pond, or, a, lake, on, an, individual, basis, as, conventions, change, from, place, to, place, and, over, time, in, origin, a, pond, is, a, variant, form, of, the, word, pound, meaning, a, confining, enclosure, in, earlier, times, ponds, were, artificial, and, utilitarian, as, stew, ponds, mill, ponds, and, so, on, the, significance, of, this, feature, seems, in, some, cases, to, have, been, lost, when, the, word, was, carried, abroad, with, emigrants, however, some, parts, of, new, england, contain, ponds, that, are, actually, the, size, of, a, small, lake, when, compared, to, other, countries, in, the, united, states, natural, pools, are, often, called, ponds, ponds, for, a, specific, purpose, keep, the, adjective, such, as, stock, pond, used, for, watering, livestock, the, term, is, also, used, for, temporary, accumulation, of, water, from, surface, runoff, ponded, water, there, are, various, regional, names, for, naturally, occurring, ponds, in, scotland, one, of, the, terms, is, lochan, which, may, also, apply, to, a, large, body, of, water, such, as, a, lake, in, the, south, western, parts, of, north, american, lakes, or, ponds, that, are, temporary, and, often, dried, up, for, most, parts, of, the, year, are, called, playas, these, playas, are, simply, shallow, depressions, in, dry, areas, that, may, only, fill, with, water, on, certain, occasion, like, excess, local, drainage, groundwater, seeping, or, rain, any, depression, in, the, ground, which, collects, and, retains, a, sufficient, amount, of, water, can, be, considered, a, pond, and, such, can, be, formed, by, a, variety, of, geological, ecological, and, human, terraforming, events, natural, ponds, are, those, caused, by, environmental, occurrences, these, can, vary, from, glacial, volcanic, fluvial, or, even, tectonic, events, since, the, pleistocene, epoch, glacial, processes, have, created, most, of, the, northern, hemispheric, ponds, an, example, is, the, prairie, pothole, region, of, north, america, when, glaciers, retreat, they, may, leave, behind, uneven, ground, due, to, bedrock, elastic, rebound, and, sediment, outwash, plains, these, areas, may, develop, depressions, that, can, fill, up, with, excess, precipitation, or, seeping, ground, water, forming, a, small, pond, kettle, lakes, and, ponds, are, formed, when, ice, breaks, off, from, a, larger, glacier, is, eventually, buried, by, the, surrounding, glacial, till, and, over, time, melts, orogenies, and, other, tectonic, uplifting, events, have, created, some, of, the, oldest, lakes, and, ponds, on, the, globe, these, indentions, have, the, tendency, to, quickly, fill, with, groundwater, if, they, occur, below, the, local, water, table, other, tectonic, rifts, or, depressions, can, fill, with, precipitation, local, mountain, runoff, or, be, fed, by, mountain, streams, volcanic, activity, can, also, lead, to, lake, and, pond, formation, through, collapsed, lava, tubes, or, volcanic, cones, natural, floodplains, along, rivers, as, well, as, landscapes, that, contain, many, depressions, may, experience, spring, rainy, season, flooding, and, snow, melt, temporary, or, vernal, ponds, are, created, this, way, and, are, important, for, breeding, fish, insects, and, amphibians, particularly, in, large, river, systems, like, the, amazon, some, ponds, are, solely, created, by, animals, species, such, as, beavers, bison, alligators, and, other, crocodilians, through, damning, and, nest, excavation, respectively, in, landscapes, with, organic, soils, local, fires, can, create, depressions, during, periods, of, drought, these, have, the, tendency, to, fill, up, with, small, amounts, of, precipitation, until, normal, water, levels, return, turning, these, isolated, ponds, into, open, water, manmade, ponds, are, those, created, by, human, intervention, for, the, sake, of, the, local, environment, industrial, settings, or, for, recreational, ornamental, use, many, ecosystems, are, linked, by, water, and, ponds, have, been, found, to, hold, a, greater, biodiversity, of, species, than, larger, freshwater, lakes, or, river, systems, as, such, ponds, are, habitats, for, many, varieties, of, organisms, including, plants, amphibians, fish, reptiles, waterfowl, insects, and, even, some, mammals, ponds, are, used, for, breeding, grounds, for, these, species, but, also, as, shelter, and, even, drinking, feeding, locations, for, other, wildlife, aquaculture, practices, lean, heavily, on, artificial, ponds, in, order, to, grow, and, care, for, many, different, type, of, fish, either, for, human, consumption, research, species, conservation, or, recreational, sport, in, agriculture, practices, treatment, ponds, can, be, created, to, reduce, nutrient, runoff, from, reaching, local, streams, or, groundwater, storages, pollutants, that, enter, ponds, can, often, be, mitigated, by, natural, sedimentation, and, other, biological, and, chemical, activities, within, the, water, as, such, waste, stabilization, ponds, are, becoming, popular, low, cost, methods, for, general, wastewater, treatment, they, may, also, provide, irrigation, reservoirs, for, struggling, farms, during, times, of, drought, as, urbanization, continues, to, spread, retention, ponds, are, becoming, more, common, in, new, housing, developments, these, ponds, reduce, the, risk, of, flooding, and, erosion, damage, from, excess, storm, water, runoff, in, local, communities, experimental, ponds, are, used, to, test, hypotheses, in, the, fields, of, environmental, science, chemistry, aquatic, biology, and, limnology, some, ponds, are, the, life, blood, of, many, small, villages, in, arid, countries, such, as, those, in, sub, saharan, africa, where, bathing, sanitation, fishing, socialization, and, rituals, are, held, in, the, indian, subcontinent, hindu, temple, monks, care, for, sacred, ponds, used, for, religious, practices, and, bathing, pilgrims, alike, in, europe, during, medieval, times, it, was, typical, for, many, monastery, and, castles, small, partly, self, sufficient, communities, to, have, fish, ponds, these, are, still, common, in, europe, and, in, east, asia, notably, japan, where, koi, may, be, kept, or, raised, in, nepal, artificial, ponds, were, essential, elements, of, the, ancient, drinking, water, supply, system, these, ponds, were, fed, with, rainwater, water, coming, in, through, canals, their, own, springs, or, a, combination, of, these, sources, they, were, designed, to, retain, the, water, while, at, the, same, time, letting, some, water, seep, away, to, feed, the, local, aquifers, a, defining, feature, of, a, pond, is, the, presence, of, standing, water, which, provides, habitat, for, a, biological, community, commonly, referred, to, as, pond, life, because, of, this, many, ponds, and, lakes, contain, large, numbers, of, endemic, species, that, have, gone, through, adaptive, radiation, to, become, specialized, to, their, preferred, habitat, familiar, examples, might, include, water, lilies, and, other, aquatic, plants, frogs, turtles, and, fish, often, the, entire, margin, of, the, pond, is, fringed, by, wetland, and, these, wetlands, support, the, aquatic, food, web, provide, shelter, for, wildlife, and, stabilize, the, shore, of, the, pond, this, margin, is, also, known, as, the, littoral, zone, and, contains, much, of, the, photosynthetic, algae, and, plants, of, this, ecosystem, called, macrophytes, other, photosynthetic, organisms, such, as, phytoplankton, suspended, algae, and, periphytons, organisms, including, cyanobacteria, detritus, and, other, microbes, thrive, here, and, stand, as, the, primary, producers, of, pond, food, webs, some, grazing, animals, like, geese, and, muskrats, consume, the, wetland, plants, directly, as, a, source, of, food, in, many, other, cases, pond, plants, will, decay, in, the, water, many, invertebrates, and, herbivorous, zooplankton, then, feed, on, the, decaying, plants, and, these, lower, trophic, level, organisms, provide, food, for, wetland, species, including, fish, dragonflies, and, herons, both, in, the, littoral, zone, and, the, limnetic, zone, the, open, water, limnetic, zone, may, allow, algae, to, grow, as, sunlight, still, penetrates, here, these, algae, may, support, yet, another, food, web, that, includes, aquatic, insects, and, other, small, fish, species, a, pond, therefore, may, have, combinations, of, three, different, food, webs, one, based, on, larger, plants, one, based, upon, decayed, plants, and, one, based, upon, algae, and, their, specific, upper, trophic, level, consumers, and, predators, hence, ponds, often, have, many, different, animal, species, using, the, wide, array, of, food, sources, though, biotic, interaction, they, therefore, provide, an, important, source, of, biological, diversity, in, landscapes, opposite, to, long, standing, ponds, are, vernal, ponds, these, ponds, dry, up, for, part, of, the, year, and, are, so, called, because, they, are, typically, at, their, peak, depth, in, the, spring, the, meaning, of, vernal, comes, form, the, latin, word, for, spring, naturally, occurring, vernal, ponds, do, not, usually, have, fish, a, major, higher, tropic, level, consumer, as, these, ponds, frequently, dry, up, the, absence, of, fish, is, a, very, important, characteristic, of, these, ponds, since, it, prevents, long, chained, biotic, interactions, from, establishing, ponds, without, these, competitive, predation, pressures, provides, breeding, locations, and, safe, havens, for, endangered, or, migrating, species, hence, introducing, fish, to, a, pond, can, have, seriously, detrimental, consequences, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, california, the, vernal, ponds, have, rare, and, endangered, plant, species, on, the, coastal, plain, they, provide, habitat, for, endangered, frogs, such, as, the, mississippi, gopher, frog, often, groups, of, ponds, in, a, given, landscape, so, called, pondscapes, offer, especially, high, biodiversity, benefits, compared, to, single, ponds, a, group, of, ponds, provides, a, higher, degree, of, habitat, complexity, and, habitat, connectivity, many, ponds, undergo, a, regular, yearly, process, in, the, same, matter, as, larger, lakes, if, they, are, deep, enough, and, or, protected, from, the, wind, abiotic, factors, such, as, uv, radiation, general, temperature, wind, speed, water, density, and, even, size, all, have, important, roles, to, play, when, it, comes, to, the, seasonal, effects, on, lakes, and, ponds, spring, overturn, summer, stratification, autumn, turnover, and, an, inverse, winter, stratification, ponds, adjust, their, stratification, or, their, vertical, zonation, of, temperature, due, to, these, influences, these, environmental, factors, affect, pond, circulation, and, temperature, gradients, within, the, water, itself, producing, distant, layers, the, epilimnion, metalimnion, and, hypolimnion, each, zone, has, varied, traits, that, sustain, or, harm, specific, organisms, and, biotic, interactions, below, the, surface, depending, on, the, season, winter, surface, ice, begins, to, melt, in, the, spring, this, allows, the, water, column, to, begin, mixing, thanks, to, solar, convection, and, wind, velocity, as, the, pond, mixes, an, overall, constant, temperature, is, reached, as, temperatures, increase, through, the, summer, thermal, stratification, takes, place, summer, stratification, allows, for, the, epilimnion, to, be, mixed, by, winds, keeping, a, consistent, warm, temperature, throughout, this, zone, here, photosynthesis, and, primary, production, flourishes, however, those, species, that, need, cooler, water, with, higher, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, will, favor, the, lower, metalimnion, or, hypolimnion, air, temperature, drops, as, fall, approaches, and, a, deep, mixing, layer, occurs, autumn, turnover, results, in, isothermal, lakes, with, high, levels, of, dissolved, oxygen, as, the, water, reaches, an, average, colder, temperature, finally, winter, stratification, occurs, inversely, to, summer, stratification, as, surface, ice, begins, to, form, yet, again, this, ice, cover, remains, until, solar, radiation, and, convection, return, in, the, spring, due, to, this, constant, change, in, vertical, zonation, seasonal, stratification, causes, habitats, to, grow, and, shrink, accordingly, certain, species, are, bound, to, these, distinct, layers, of, the, water, column, where, they, can, thrive, and, survive, with, the, best, efficiency, possible, for, more, information, regarding, seasonal, thermal, stratification, of, ponds, and, lakes, please, look, at, lake, stratification, ponds, provide, not, only, environmental, values, but, practical, benefits, to, society, one, increasingly, crucial, benefit, that, ponds, provide, is, their, ability, to, act, as, greenhouse, gas, sinks, most, natural, lakes, and, ponds, are, greenhouse, gas, sources, and, aid, in, the, flux, of, these, dissolved, compounds, however, manmade, farm, ponds, are, becoming, significant, sinks, for, gas, mitigation, and, the, fight, against, climate, change, these, agriculture, runoff, ponds, receive, high, ph, level, water, from, surrounding, soils, highly, acidic, drainage, ponds, act, as, catalysis, for, excess, co, 2, carbon, dioxide, to, be, converted, into, forms, of, carbon, that, can, easily, be, stored, in, sediments, when, these, new, drainage, ponds, are, constructed, concentrations, of, bacteria, that, normally, break, down, dead, organic, matter, such, as, algae, are, low, as, a, result, breakdown, and, release, of, nitrogen, gases, from, these, organic, materials, such, as, n, 2, o, does, not, occur, and, thus, not, added, to, our, atmosphere, this, process, is, also, used, with, regular, denitrification, in, anoxic, layer, of, ponds, however, not, all, ponds, have, the, ability, to, become, sinks, for, greenhouse, gasses, most, ponds, experience, eutrophication, where, faced, with, excessive, nutrient, input, from, fertilizers, and, runoff, this, over, nitrifies, the, pond, water, and, results, in, mass, algae, blooms, and, local, fish, kills, some, farm, ponds, are, not, used, for, runoff, control, but, rather, for, livestock, like, cattle, or, buffalo, as, watering, and, bathing, holes, as, mentioned, in, the, use, section, ponds, are, important, hotspots, for, biodiversity, sometimes, this, becomes, an, issue, with, invasive, or, introduced, species, that, disrupt, pond, ecosystem, dynamics, such, as, food, web, structure, niche, partitioning, and, guild, assignments, this, varies, from, introduced, fish, species, such, as, the, common, carp, that, eat, native, water, plants, or, northern, snakeheads, that, attack, breeding, amphibians, aquatic, snails, that, carry, infectious, parasites, that, kill, other, species, and, even, rapid, spreading, aquatic, plants, like, hydrilla, and, duckweed, that, can, restrict, water, flow, and, cause, overbank, flooding, ponds, depending, on, their, orientation, and, size, can, spread, their, wetland, habitats, into, the, local, riparian, zones, or, watershed, boundaries, gentle, slopes, of, land, into, ponds, provides, an, expanse, of, habitat, for, wetland, plants, and, wet, meadows, to, expand, beyond, the, limitation, of, the, pond, however, the, construction, of, retaining, walls, lawns, and, other, urbanized, developments, can, severely, degrade, the, range, of, pond, habitats, and, the, longevity, of, the, pond, itself, roads, and, highways, act, in, the, same, manor, but, they, also, interfere, with, amphibians, and, turtles, that, migrate, to, and, from, ponds, as, part, of, their, annual, breeding, cycle, and, should, be, kept, as, far, away, from, established, ponds, as, possible, because, of, these, factors, gently, sloping, shorelines, with, broad, expanses, of, wetland, plants, not, only, provide, the, best, conditions, for, wildlife, but, they, help, protect, water, quality, from, sources, in, the, surrounding, landscapes, it, is, also, beneficial, to, allow, water, levels, to, fall, each, year, during, drier, periods, in, order, to, re, establish, these, gentile, shorelines, in, landscapes, where, ponds, are, artificially, constructed, they, are, done, so, to, provide, wildlife, viewing, and, conservation, opportunities, to, treat, wastewater, for, sequestration, and, pollution, containment, or, for, simply, aesthetic, purposes, for, natural, pond, conservation, and, development, one, way, to, stimulate, this, is, with, general, stream, and, river, restoration, many, small, rivers, and, streams, feed, into, or, from, local, ponds, within, the, same, watershed, when, these, rivers, and, streams, flood, and, begin, to, meander, large, numbers, of, natural, ponds, including, vernal, pools, and, wetlands, develop, some, notable, ponds, are
