cadmium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cd, and, atomic, number, 48, this, soft, silvery, white, metal, is, chemically, similar, to, the, two, other, stable, metals, in, group, 12, zinc, and, mercury, like, zinc, it, demonstrates, oxidation, state, 2, in, most, of, its, compounds, and, like, mercury, it, has, a, lower, melting, point, than, the, transition, metals, in, groups, 3, through, 11, cadmium, and, its, congeners, in, group, 12, are, often, not, considered, transition, metals, in, that, they, do, not, have, partly, filled, d, or, f, electron, shells, in, the, elemental, or, common, oxidation, states, the, average, concentration, of, cadmium, in, earth, s, crust, is, between, 0, 1, and, 0, 5, parts, per, million, ppm, it, was, discovered, in, 1817, simultaneously, by, stromeyer, and, hermann, both, in, germany, as, an, impurity, in, zinc, carbonate, cadmium, occurs, as, a, minor, component, in, most, zinc, ores, and, is, a, byproduct, of, zinc, production, it, was, used, for, a, long, time, in, the, 1900s, as, a, corrosion, resistant, plating, on, steel, and, cadmium, compounds, are, used, as, red, orange, and, yellow, pigments, to, color, glass, and, to, stabilize, plastic, cadmium, s, use, is, generally, decreasing, because, it, is, toxic, it, is, specifically, listed, in, the, european, restriction, of, hazardous, substances, directive, and, nickel, cadmium, batteries, have, been, replaced, with, nickel, metal, hydride, and, lithium, ion, batteries, due, to, it, being, a, neutron, poison, cadmium, is, also, used, as, a, component, of, control, rods, in, nuclear, fission, reactors, one, of, its, few, new, uses, is, in, cadmium, telluride, solar, panels, although, cadmium, has, no, known, biological, function, in, higher, organisms, a, cadmium, dependent, carbonic, anhydrase, has, been, found, in, marine, diatoms, cadmium, is, a, soft, malleable, ductile, silvery, white, divalent, metal, it, is, similar, in, many, respects, to, zinc, but, forms, complex, compounds, unlike, most, other, metals, cadmium, is, resistant, to, corrosion, and, is, used, as, a, protective, plate, on, other, metals, as, a, bulk, metal, cadmium, is, insoluble, in, water, and, is, not, flammable, however, in, its, powdered, form, it, may, burn, and, release, toxic, fumes, although, cadmium, usually, has, an, oxidation, state, of, 2, it, also, exists, in, the, 1, state, cadmium, and, its, congeners, are, not, always, considered, transition, metals, in, that, they, do, not, have, partly, filled, d, or, f, electron, shells, in, the, elemental, or, common, oxidation, states, cadmium, burns, in, air, to, form, brown, amorphous, cadmium, oxide, cdo, the, crystalline, form, of, this, compound, is, a, dark, red, which, changes, color, when, heated, similar, to, zinc, oxide, hydrochloric, acid, sulfuric, acid, and, nitric, acid, dissolve, cadmium, by, forming, cadmium, chloride, cdcl, 2, cadmium, sulfate, cdso, 4, or, cadmium, nitrate, cd, no, 3, 2, the, oxidation, state, 1, can, be, produced, by, dissolving, cadmium, in, a, mixture, of, cadmium, chloride, and, aluminium, chloride, forming, the, cd, 2, 2, cation, which, is, similar, to, the, hg, 2, 2, cation, in, mercury, i, chloride, the, structures, of, many, cadmium, complexes, with, nucleobases, amino, acids, and, vitamins, have, been, determined, naturally, occurring, cadmium, is, composed, of, eight, isotopes, two, of, them, are, radioactive, and, three, are, expected, to, decay, but, have, not, measurably, done, so, under, laboratory, conditions, the, two, natural, radioactive, isotopes, are, 113, cd, beta, decay, half, life, is, 7, 7, 10, 15, y, and, 116, cd, two, neutrino, double, beta, decay, half, life, is, 2, 9, 10, 19, y, the, other, three, are, 106, cd, 108, cd, both, double, electron, capture, and, 114, cd, double, beta, decay, only, lower, limits, on, these, half, lives, have, been, determined, at, least, three, isotopes, 110, cd, 111, cd, and, 112, cd, are, stable, among, the, isotopes, that, do, not, occur, naturally, the, most, long, lived, are, 109, cd, with, a, half, life, of, 462, 6, days, and, 115, cd, with, a, half, life, of, 53, 46, hours, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, 2, 5, hours, and, the, majority, have, half, lives, of, less, than, 5, minutes, cadmium, has, 8, known, meta, states, with, the, most, stable, being, 113m, cd, t, 1, 2, 14, 1, years, 115m, cd, t, 1, 2, 44, 6, days, and, 117m, cd, t, 1, 2, 3, 36, hours, the, known, isotopes, of, cadmium, range, in, atomic, mass, from, 94, 950, u, 95, cd, to, 131, 946, u, 132, cd, for, isotopes, lighter, than, 112, u, the, primary, decay, mode, is, electron, capture, and, the, dominant, decay, product, is, element, 47, silver, heavier, isotopes, decay, mostly, through, beta, emission, producing, element, 49, indium, one, isotope, of, cadmium, 113, cd, absorbs, neutrons, with, high, selectivity, with, very, high, probability, neutrons, with, energy, below, the, cadmium, cut, off, will, be, absorbed, those, higher, than, the, cut, off, will, be, transmitted, the, cadmium, cut, off, is, about, 0, 5, ev, and, neutrons, below, that, level, are, deemed, slow, neutrons, distinct, from, intermediate, and, fast, neutrons, cadmium, is, created, via, the, s, process, in, low, to, medium, mass, stars, with, masses, of, 0, 6, to, 10, solar, masses, over, thousands, of, years, in, that, process, a, silver, atom, captures, a, neutron, and, then, undergoes, beta, decay, cadmium, latin, cadmia, greek, meaning, calamine, a, cadmium, bearing, mixture, of, minerals, that, was, named, after, the, greek, mythological, character, cadmus, the, founder, of, thebes, was, discovered, in, contaminated, zinc, compounds, sold, in, pharmacies, in, germany, in, 1817, by, friedrich, stromeyer, karl, samuel, leberecht, hermann, simultaneously, investigated, the, discoloration, in, zinc, oxide, and, found, an, impurity, first, suspected, to, be, arsenic, because, of, the, yellow, precipitate, with, hydrogen, sulfide, additionally, stromeyer, discovered, that, one, supplier, sold, zinc, carbonate, instead, of, zinc, oxide, stromeyer, found, the, new, element, as, an, impurity, in, zinc, carbonate, calamine, and, for, 100, years, germany, remained, the, only, important, producer, of, the, metal, the, metal, was, named, after, the, latin, word, for, calamine, because, it, was, found, in, this, zinc, ore, stromeyer, noted, that, some, impure, samples, of, calamine, changed, color, when, heated, but, pure, calamine, did, not, he, was, persistent, in, studying, these, results, and, eventually, isolated, cadmium, metal, by, roasting, and, reducing, the, sulfide, the, potential, for, cadmium, yellow, as, pigment, was, recognized, in, the, 1840s, but, the, lack, of, cadmium, limited, this, application, even, though, cadmium, and, its, compounds, are, toxic, in, certain, forms, and, concentrations, the, british, pharmaceutical, codex, from, 1907, states, that, cadmium, iodide, was, used, as, a, medication, to, treat, enlarged, joints, scrofulous, glands, and, chilblains, in, 1907, the, international, astronomical, union, defined, the, international, ngstr, m, in, terms, of, a, red, cadmium, spectral, line, 1, wavelength, 6438, 46963, this, was, adopted, by, the, 7th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1927, in, 1960, the, definitions, of, both, the, metre, and, ngstr, m, were, changed, to, use, krypton, after, the, industrial, scale, production, of, cadmium, started, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, major, application, of, cadmium, was, the, coating, of, iron, and, steel, to, prevent, corrosion, in, 1944, 62, and, in, 1956, 59, of, the, cadmium, in, the, united, states, was, used, for, plating, in, 1956, 24, of, the, cadmium, in, the, united, states, was, used, for, a, second, application, in, red, orange, and, yellow, pigments, from, sulfides, and, selenides, of, cadmium, the, stabilizing, effect, of, cadmium, chemicals, like, the, carboxylates, cadmium, laurate, and, cadmium, stearate, on, pvc, led, to, an, increased, use, of, those, compounds, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, demand, for, cadmium, in, pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and, alloys, declined, as, a, result, of, environmental, and, health, regulations, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, 2006, only, 7, of, total, cadmium, consumption, was, used, for, plating, and, only, 10, was, used, for, pigments, at, the, same, time, these, decreases, in, consumption, were, compensated, by, a, growing, demand, for, cadmium, for, nickel, cadmium, batteries, which, accounted, for, 81, of, the, cadmium, consumption, in, the, united, states, in, 2006, cadmium, makes, up, about, 0, 1, ppm, of, earth, s, crust, and, is, the, 65th, most, abundant, element, it, is, much, rarer, than, zinc, which, makes, up, about, 65, ppm, no, significant, deposits, of, cadmium, containing, ores, are, known, the, only, cadmium, mineral, of, importance, greenockite, cd, s, is, nearly, always, associated, with, sphalerite, zns, this, association, is, caused, by, geochemical, similarity, between, zinc, and, cadmium, with, no, geological, process, likely, to, separate, them, thus, cadmium, is, produced, mainly, as, a, byproduct, of, mining, smelting, and, refining, sulfidic, ores, of, zinc, and, to, a, lesser, degree, lead, and, copper, small, amounts, of, cadmium, about, 10, of, consumption, are, produced, from, secondary, sources, mainly, from, dust, generated, by, recycling, iron, and, steel, scrap, production, in, the, united, states, began, in, 1907, but, wide, use, began, after, world, war, i, metallic, cadmium, can, be, found, in, the, vilyuy, river, basin, in, siberia, rocks, mined, for, phosphate, fertilizers, contain, varying, amounts, of, cadmium, resulting, in, a, cadmium, concentration, of, as, much, as, 300, mg, kg, in, the, fertilizers, and, a, high, cadmium, content, in, agricultural, soils, coal, can, contain, significant, amounts, of, cadmium, which, ends, up, mostly, in, coal, fly, ash, cadmium, in, soil, can, be, absorbed, by, crops, such, as, rice, and, cocoa, in, 2002, the, chinese, ministry, of, agriculture, measured, that, 28, of, rice, it, sampled, had, excess, lead, and, 10, had, excess, cadmium, above, limits, defined, by, law, consumer, reports, tested, 28, brands, of, dark, chocolate, sold, in, the, united, states, in, 2022, and, found, cadmium, in, all, of, them, with, 13, exceeding, the, california, maximum, allowable, dose, level, some, plants, such, as, willow, trees, and, poplars, have, been, found, to, clean, both, lead, and, cadmium, from, soil, typical, background, concentrations, of, cadmium, do, not, exceed, 5, ng, m, 3, in, the, atmosphere, 2, mg, kg, in, soil, 1, g, l, in, freshwater, and, 50, ng, l, in, seawater, concentrations, of, cadmium, above, 10, g, l, may, be, stable, in, water, having, low, total, solute, concentrations, and, p, h, and, can, be, difficult, to, remove, by, conventional, water, treatment, processes, cadmium, is, a, common, impurity, in, zinc, ores, and, it, is, most, often, isolated, during, the, production, of, zinc, some, zinc, ores, concentrates, from, zinc, sulfate, ores, contain, up, to, 1, 4, of, cadmium, in, the, 1970s, the, output, of, cadmium, was, 2, 9, kilograms, 6, 5, lb, per, ton, of, zinc, zinc, sulfide, ores, are, roasted, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, converting, the, zinc, sulfide, to, the, oxide, zinc, metal, is, produced, either, by, smelting, the, oxide, with, carbon, or, by, electrolysis, in, sulfuric, acid, cadmium, is, isolated, from, the, zinc, metal, by, vacuum, distillation, if, the, zinc, is, smelted, or, cadmium, sulfate, is, precipitated, from, the, electrolysis, solution, the, british, geological, survey, reports, that, in, 2001, china, was, the, top, producer, of, cadmium, with, almost, one, sixth, of, the, world, s, production, closely, followed, by, south, korea, and, japan, cadmium, is, a, common, component, of, electric, batteries, pigments, coatings, and, electroplating, in, 2009, 86, of, cadmium, was, used, in, batteries, predominantly, in, rechargeable, nickel, cadmium, batteries, nickel, cadmium, cells, have, a, nominal, cell, potential, of, 1, 2, v, the, cell, consists, of, a, positive, nickel, hydroxide, electrode, and, a, negative, cadmium, electrode, plate, separated, by, an, alkaline, electrolyte, potassium, hydroxide, the, european, union, put, a, limit, on, cadmium, in, electronics, in, 2004, of, 0, 01, with, some, exceptions, and, in, 2006, reduced, the, limit, on, cadmium, content, to, 0, 002, another, type, of, battery, based, on, cadmium, is, the, silver, cadmium, battery, cadmium, electroplating, consuming, 6, of, the, global, production, is, used, in, the, aircraft, industry, to, reduce, corrosion, of, steel, components, this, coating, is, passivated, by, chromate, salts, a, limitation, of, cadmium, plating, is, hydrogen, embrittlement, of, high, strength, steels, from, the, electroplating, process, therefore, steel, parts, heat, treated, to, tensile, strength, above, 1300, mpa, 200, ksi, should, be, coated, by, an, alternative, method, such, as, special, low, embrittlement, cadmium, electroplating, processes, or, physical, vapor, deposition, titanium, embrittlement, from, cadmium, plated, tool, residues, resulted, in, banishment, of, those, tools, and, the, implementation, of, routine, tool, testing, to, detect, cadmium, contamination, in, the, a, 12, sr, 71, u, 2, and, subsequent, aircraft, programs, that, use, titanium, cadmium, is, used, in, the, control, rods, of, nuclear, reactors, acting, as, a, very, effective, neutron, poison, to, control, neutron, flux, in, nuclear, fission, when, cadmium, rods, are, inserted, in, the, core, of, a, nuclear, reactor, cadmium, absorbs, neutrons, preventing, them, from, creating, additional, fission, events, thus, controlling, the, amount, of, reactivity, the, pressurized, water, reactor, designed, by, westinghouse, electric, company, uses, an, alloy, consisting, of, 80, silver, 15, indium, and, 5, cadmium, qled, tvs, have, been, starting, to, include, cadmium, in, construction, some, companies, have, been, looking, to, reduce, the, environmental, impact, of, human, exposure, and, pollution, of, the, material, in, televisions, during, production, complexes, based, on, cadmium, and, other, heavy, metals, have, potential, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, but, their, use, is, often, limited, due, to, toxic, side, effects, cadmium, oxide, was, used, in, black, and, white, television, phosphors, and, in, the, blue, and, green, phosphors, of, color, television, cathode, ray, tubes, cadmium, sulfide, cds, is, used, as, a, photoconductive, surface, coating, for, photocopier, drums, various, cadmium, salts, are, used, in, paint, pigments, with, cds, as, a, yellow, pigment, being, the, most, common, cadmium, selenide, is, a, red, pigment, commonly, called, cadmium, red, to, painters, who, work, with, the, pigment, cadmium, provides, the, most, brilliant, and, durable, yellows, oranges, and, reds, so, much, so, that, during, production, these, colors, are, significantly, toned, down, before, they, are, ground, with, oils, and, binders, or, blended, into, watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and, other, paint, and, pigment, formulations, because, these, pigments, are, potentially, toxic, users, should, use, a, barrier, cream, on, the, hands, to, prevent, absorption, through, the, skin, even, though, the, amount, of, cadmium, absorbed, into, the, body, through, the, skin, is, reported, to, be, less, than, 1, in, pvc, cadmium, was, used, as, heat, light, and, weathering, stabilizers, currently, cadmium, stabilizers, have, been, completely, replaced, with, barium, zinc, calcium, zinc, and, organo, tin, stabilizers, cadmium, is, used, in, many, kinds, of, solder, and, bearing, alloys, because, it, has, a, low, coefficient, of, friction, and, fatigue, resistance, it, is, also, found, in, some, of, the, lowest, melting, alloys, such, as, wood, s, metal, cadmium, is, an, element, in, some, semiconductor, materials, cadmium, sulfide, cadmium, selenide, and, cadmium, telluride, are, used, in, some, photodetectors, and, solar, cells, hgcdte, detectors, are, sensitive, to, mid, infrared, light, and, used, in, some, motion, detectors, helium, cadmium, lasers, are, a, common, source, of, blue, or, ultraviolet, laser, light, lasers, at, wavelengths, of, 325, 354, and, 442, nm, are, made, using, this, gain, medium, some, models, can, switch, between, these, wavelengths, they, are, notably, used, in, fluorescence, microscopy, as, well, as, various, laboratory, uses, requiring, laser, light, at, these, wavelengths, cadmium, selenide, quantum, dots, emit, bright, luminescence, under, uv, excitation, he, cd, laser, for, example, the, color, of, this, luminescence, can, be, green, yellow, or, red, depending, on, the, particle, size, colloidal, solutions, of, those, particles, are, used, for, imaging, of, biological, tissues, and, solutions, with, a, fluorescence, microscope, in, molecular, biology, cadmium, is, used, to, block, voltage, dependent, calcium, channels, from, fluxing, calcium, ions, as, well, as, in, hypoxia, research, to, stimulate, proteasome, dependent, degradation, of, hif, 1, cadmium, selective, sensors, based, on, the, fluorophore, bodipy, have, been, developed, for, imaging, and, sensing, of, cadmium, in, cells, one, powerful, method, for, monitoring, cadmium, in, aqueous, environments, involves, electrochemistry, by, employing, a, self, assembled, monolayer, one, can, obtain, a, cadmium, selective, electrode, with, a, ppt, level, sensitivity, cadmium, has, no, known, function, in, higher, organisms, and, is, considered, toxic, cadmium, is, considered, an, environmental, pollutant, hazardous, to, living, organisms, a, cadmium, dependent, carbonic, anhydrase, has, been, found, in, some, marine, diatoms, which, live, in, environments, with, low, zinc, concentrations, cadmium, is, preferentially, absorbed, in, the, kidneys, of, humans, up, to, about, 30, mg, of, cadmium, is, commonly, inhaled, throughout, human, childhood, and, adolescence, cadmium, is, under, research, for, its, potential, toxicity, to, increase, the, risk, of, cancer, cardiovascular, disease, and, osteoporosis, the, biogeochemistry, of, cadmium, and, its, release, to, the, environment, is, under, research, individuals, and, organizations, have, been, reviewing, cadmium, s, bioinorganic, aspects, for, its, toxicity, the, most, dangerous, form, of, occupational, exposure, to, cadmium, is, inhalation, of, fine, dust, and, fumes, or, ingestion, of, highly, soluble, cadmium, compounds, inhalation, of, cadmium, fumes, can, result, initially, in, metal, fume, fever, but, may, progress, to, chemical, pneumonitis, pulmonary, edema, and, death, cadmium, is, also, an, environmental, hazard, human, exposure, is, primarily, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, phosphate, fertilizers, natural, sources, iron, and, steel, production, cement, production, and, related, activities, nonferrous, metals, production, and, municipal, solid, waste, incineration, other, sources, of, cadmium, include, bread, root, crops, and, vegetables, there, have, been, a, few, instances, of, general, population, poisoning, as, the, result, of, long, term, exposure, to, cadmium, in, contaminated, food, and, water, research, into, an, estrogen, mimicry, that, may, induce, breast, cancer, is, ongoing, as, of, 2012, in, the, decades, leading, up, to, world, war, ii, mining, operations, contaminated, the, jinz, river, in, japan, with, cadmium, and, traces, of, other, toxic, metals, as, a, consequence, cadmium, accumulated, in, the, rice, crops, along, the, riverbanks, downstream, of, the, mines, some, members, of, the, local, agricultural, communities, consumed, the, contaminated, rice, and, developed, itai, itai, disease, and, renal, abnormalities, including, proteinuria, and, glucosuria, the, victims, of, this, poisoning, were, almost, exclusively, post, menopausal, women, with, low, iron, and, low, body, stores, of, other, minerals, similar, general, population, cadmium, exposures, in, other, parts, of, the, world, have, not, resulted, in, the, same, health, problems, because, the, populations, maintained, sufficient, iron, and, other, mineral, levels, thus, although, cadmium, is, a, major, factor, in, the, itai, itai, disease, in, japan, most, researchers, have, concluded, that, it, was, one, of, several, factors, cadmium, is, one, of, ten, substances, banned, by, the, european, union, s, restriction, of, hazardous, substances, rohs, directive, which, regulates, hazardous, substances, in, electrical, and, electronic, equipment, but, allows, for, certain, exemptions, and, exclusions, from, the, scope, of, the, law, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, has, classified, cadmium, and, cadmium, compounds, as, carcinogenic, to, humans, although, occupational, exposure, to, cadmium, is, linked, to, lung, and, prostate, cancer, there, is, still, uncertainty, about, the, carcinogenicity, of, cadmium, in, low, environmental, exposure, recent, data, from, epidemiological, studies, suggest, that, intake, of, cadmium, through, diet, is, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, endometrial, breast, and, prostate, cancer, as, well, as, with, osteoporosis, in, humans, a, recent, study, has, demonstrated, that, endometrial, tissue, is, characterized, by, higher, levels, of, cadmium, in, current, and, former, smoking, females, cadmium, exposure, is, associated, with, a, large, number, of, illnesses, including, kidney, disease, early, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and, cardiovascular, diseases, although, studies, show, a, significant, correlation, between, cadmium, exposure, and, occurrence, of, disease, in, human, populations, a, molecular, mechanism, has, not, yet, been, identified, one, hypothesis, holds, that, cadmium, is, an, endocrine, disruptor, and, some, experimental, studies, have, shown, that, it, can, interact, with, different, hormonal, signaling, pathways, for, example, cadmium, can, bind, to, the, estrogen, receptor, alpha, and, affect, signal, transduction, along, the, estrogen, and, mapk, signaling, pathways, at, low, doses, the, tobacco, plant, absorbs, and, accumulates, heavy, metals, such, as, cadmium, from, the, surrounding, soil, into, its, leaves, following, tobacco, smoke, inhalation, these, are, readily, absorbed, into, the, body, of, users, tobacco, smoking, is, the, most, important, single, source, of, cadmium, exposure, in, the, general, population, an, estimated, 10, of, the, cadmium, content, of, a, cigarette, is, inhaled, through, smoking, absorption, of, cadmium, through, the, lungs, is, more, effective, than, through, the, gut, as, much, as, 50, of, the, cadmium, inhaled, in, cigarette, smoke, may, be, absorbed, on, average, cadmium, concentrations, in, the, blood, of, smokers, is, 4, to, 5, times, greater, than, non, smokers, and, in, the, kidney, 2, 3, times, greater, than, in, non, smokers, despite, the, high, cadmium, content, in, cigarette, smoke, there, seems, to, be, little, exposure, to, cadmium, from, passive, smoking, in, a, non, smoking, population, food, is, the, greatest, source, of, exposure, high, quantities, of, cadmium, can, be, found, in, crustaceans, mollusks, offal, frog, legs, cocoa, solids, bitter, and, semi, bitter, chocolate, seaweed, fungi, and, algae, products, however, grains, vegetables, and, starchy, roots, and, tubers, are, consumed, in, much, greater, quantity, in, the, u, s, and, are, the, source, of, the, greatest, dietary, exposure, there, most, plants, bio, accumulate, metal, toxins, such, as, cadmium, and, when, composted, to, form, organic, fertilizers, yield, a, product, that, often, can, contain, high, amounts, e, g, over, 0, 5, mg, of, metal, toxins, for, every, kilogram, of, fertilizer, fertilizers, made, from, animal, dung, e, g, cow, dung, or, urban, waste, can, contain, similar, amounts, of, cadmium, the, cadmium, added, to, the, soil, from, fertilizers, rock, phosphates, or, organic, fertilizers, become, bio, available, and, toxic, only, if, the, soil, ph, is, low, i, e, acidic, soils, in, the, european, union, an, analysis, of, almost, 22, 000, topsoil, samples, with, lucas, survey, concluded, that, 5, 5, of, samples, have, concentrations, higher, than, 1, mg, kg, 1, zinc, copper, calcium, and, iron, ions, and, selenium, with, vitamin, c, are, used, to, treat, cadmium, intoxication, although, it, is, not, easily, reversed, because, of, the, adverse, effects, of, cadmium, on, the, environment, and, human, health, the, supply, and, use, of, cadmium, is, restricted, in, europe, under, the, reach, regulation, the, efsa, panel, on, contaminants, in, the, food, chain, specifies, that, 2, 5, g, kg, body, weight, is, a, tolerable, weekly, intake, for, humans, the, joint, fao, who, expert, committee, on, food, additives, has, declared, 7, g, kg, body, weight, to, be, the, provisional, tolerable,
