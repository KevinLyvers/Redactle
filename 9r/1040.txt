in, physics, a, subatomic, particle, is, a, particle, smaller, than, an, atom, according, to, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, a, subatomic, particle, can, be, either, a, composite, particle, which, is, composed, of, other, particles, for, example, a, baryon, like, a, proton, or, a, neutron, composed, of, three, quarks, or, a, meson, composed, of, two, quarks, or, an, elementary, particle, which, is, not, composed, of, other, particles, for, example, quarks, or, electrons, muons, and, tau, particles, which, are, called, leptons, particle, physics, and, nuclear, physics, study, these, particles, and, how, they, interact, most, force, carrying, particles, like, photons, or, gluons, are, called, bosons, and, although, they, have, quanta, of, energy, do, not, have, rest, mass, or, discrete, diameters, other, than, pure, energy, wavelength, and, are, unlike, the, former, particles, that, have, rest, mass, and, cannot, overlap, or, combine, which, are, called, fermions, the, w, and, z, bosons, however, are, an, exception, to, this, rule, and, have, relatively, large, rest, masses, at, approximately, 80gev, and, 90gev, respectively, experiments, show, that, light, could, behave, like, a, stream, of, particles, called, photons, as, well, as, exhibiting, wave, like, properties, this, led, to, the, concept, of, wave, particle, duality, to, reflect, that, quantum, scale, particles, behave, both, like, particles, and, like, waves, they, are, sometimes, called, wavicles, to, reflect, this, another, concept, the, uncertainty, principle, states, that, some, of, their, properties, taken, together, such, as, their, simultaneous, position, and, momentum, cannot, be, measured, exactly, the, wave, particle, duality, has, been, shown, to, apply, not, only, to, photons, but, to, more, massive, particles, as, well, interactions, of, particles, in, the, framework, of, quantum, field, theory, are, understood, as, creation, and, annihilation, of, quanta, of, corresponding, fundamental, interactions, this, blends, particle, physics, with, field, theory, even, among, particle, physicists, the, exact, definition, of, a, particle, has, diverse, descriptions, these, professional, attempts, at, the, definition, of, a, particle, include, subatomic, particles, are, either, elementary, i, e, not, made, of, multiple, other, particles, or, composite, and, made, of, more, than, one, elementary, particle, bound, together, the, elementary, particles, of, the, standard, model, are, all, of, these, have, now, been, discovered, through, experiments, with, the, latest, being, the, top, quark, 1995, tau, neutrino, 2000, and, higgs, boson, 2012, various, extensions, of, the, standard, model, predict, the, existence, of, an, elementary, graviton, particle, and, many, other, elementary, particles, but, none, have, been, discovered, as, of, 2021, the, word, hadron, comes, from, greek, and, was, introduced, in, 1962, by, lev, okun, nearly, all, composite, particles, contain, multiple, quarks, and, or, antiquarks, bound, together, by, gluons, with, a, few, exceptions, with, no, quarks, such, as, positronium, and, muonium, those, containing, few, 5, quarks, including, antiquarks, are, called, hadrons, due, to, a, property, known, as, color, confinement, quarks, are, never, found, singly, but, always, occur, in, hadrons, containing, multiple, quarks, the, hadrons, are, divided, by, number, of, quarks, including, antiquarks, into, the, baryons, containing, an, odd, number, of, quarks, almost, always, 3, of, which, the, proton, and, neutron, the, two, nucleons, are, by, far, the, best, known, and, the, mesons, containing, an, even, number, of, quarks, almost, always, 2, one, quark, and, one, antiquark, of, which, the, pions, and, kaons, are, the, best, known, except, for, the, proton, and, neutron, all, other, hadrons, are, unstable, and, decay, into, other, particles, in, microseconds, or, less, a, proton, is, made, of, two, up, quarks, and, one, down, quark, while, the, neutron, is, made, of, two, down, quarks, and, one, up, quark, these, commonly, bind, together, into, an, atomic, nucleus, e, g, a, helium, 4, nucleus, is, composed, of, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, most, hadrons, do, not, live, long, enough, to, bind, into, nucleus, like, composites, those, that, do, other, than, the, proton, and, neutron, form, exotic, nuclei, any, subatomic, particle, like, any, particle, in, the, three, dimensional, space, that, obeys, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, can, be, either, a, boson, with, integer, spin, or, a, fermion, with, odd, half, integer, spin, in, the, standard, model, all, the, elementary, fermions, have, spin, 1, 2, and, are, divided, into, the, quarks, which, carry, color, charge, and, therefore, feel, the, strong, interaction, and, the, leptons, which, do, not, the, elementary, bosons, comprise, the, gauge, bosons, photon, w, and, z, gluons, with, spin, 1, while, the, higgs, boson, is, the, only, elementary, particle, with, spin, zero, the, hypothetical, graviton, is, required, theoretically, to, have, spin, 2, but, is, not, part, of, the, standard, model, some, extensions, such, as, supersymmetry, predict, additional, elementary, particles, with, spin, 3, 2, but, none, have, been, discovered, as, of, 2021, due, to, the, laws, for, spin, of, composite, particles, the, baryons, 3, quarks, have, spin, either, 1, 2, or, 3, 2, and, are, therefore, fermions, the, mesons, 2, quarks, have, integer, spin, of, either, 0, or, 1, and, are, therefore, bosons, in, special, relativity, the, energy, of, a, particle, at, rest, equals, its, mass, times, the, speed, of, light, squared, e, mc, 2, that, is, mass, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, energy, and, vice, versa, if, a, particle, has, a, frame, of, reference, in, which, it, lies, at, rest, then, it, has, a, positive, rest, mass, and, is, referred, to, as, massive, all, composite, particles, are, massive, baryons, meaning, heavy, tend, to, have, greater, mass, than, mesons, meaning, intermediate, which, in, turn, tend, to, be, heavier, than, leptons, meaning, lightweight, but, the, heaviest, lepton, the, tau, particle, is, heavier, than, the, two, lightest, flavours, of, baryons, nucleons, it, is, also, certain, that, any, particle, with, an, electric, charge, is, massive, when, originally, defined, in, the, 1950s, the, terms, baryons, mesons, and, leptons, referred, to, masses, however, after, the, quark, model, became, accepted, in, the, 1970s, it, was, recognised, that, baryons, are, composites, of, three, quarks, mesons, are, composites, of, one, quark, and, one, antiquark, while, leptons, are, elementary, and, are, defined, as, the, elementary, fermions, with, no, color, charge, all, massless, particles, particles, whose, invariant, mass, is, zero, are, elementary, these, include, the, photon, and, gluon, although, the, latter, cannot, be, isolated, most, subatomic, particles, are, not, stable, all, leptons, as, well, as, baryons, decay, by, either, the, strong, force, or, weak, force, except, for, the, proton, protons, are, not, known, to, decay, although, whether, they, are, truly, stable, is, unknown, as, some, very, important, grand, unified, theories, guts, actually, require, it, the, and, muons, as, well, as, their, antiparticles, decay, by, the, weak, force, neutrinos, and, antineutrinos, do, not, decay, but, a, related, phenomenon, of, neutrino, oscillations, is, thought, to, exist, even, in, vacuums, the, electron, and, its, antiparticle, the, positron, are, theoretically, stable, due, to, charge, conservation, unless, a, lighter, particle, having, magnitude, of, electric, charge, e, exists, which, is, unlikely, its, charge, is, not, shown, yet, all, observable, subatomic, particles, have, their, electric, charge, an, integer, multiple, of, the, elementary, charge, the, standard, model, s, quarks, have, non, integer, electric, charges, namely, multiple, of, 1, 3, e, but, quarks, and, other, combinations, with, non, integer, electric, charge, cannot, be, isolated, due, to, color, confinement, for, baryons, mesons, and, their, antiparticles, the, constituent, quarks, charges, sum, up, to, an, integer, multiple, of, e, through, the, work, of, albert, einstein, satyendra, nath, bose, louis, de, broglie, and, many, others, current, scientific, theory, holds, that, all, particles, also, have, a, wave, nature, this, has, been, verified, not, only, for, elementary, particles, but, also, for, compound, particles, like, atoms, and, even, molecules, in, fact, according, to, traditional, formulations, of, non, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, wave, particle, duality, applies, to, all, objects, even, macroscopic, ones, although, the, wave, properties, of, macroscopic, objects, cannot, be, detected, due, to, their, small, wavelengths, interactions, between, particles, have, been, scrutinized, for, many, centuries, and, a, few, simple, laws, underpin, how, particles, behave, in, collisions, and, interactions, the, most, fundamental, of, these, are, the, laws, of, conservation, of, energy, and, conservation, of, momentum, which, let, us, make, calculations, of, particle, interactions, on, scales, of, magnitude, that, range, from, stars, to, quarks, these, are, the, prerequisite, basics, of, newtonian, mechanics, a, series, of, statements, and, equations, in, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, originally, published, in, 1687, the, negatively, charged, electron, has, a, mass, of, about, 1, 1836, of, that, of, a, hydrogen, atom, the, remainder, of, the, hydrogen, atom, s, mass, comes, from, the, positively, charged, proton, the, atomic, number, of, an, element, is, the, number, of, protons, in, its, nucleus, neutrons, are, neutral, particles, having, a, mass, slightly, greater, than, that, of, the, proton, different, isotopes, of, the, same, element, contain, the, same, number, of, protons, but, different, numbers, of, neutrons, the, mass, number, of, an, isotope, is, the, total, number, of, nucleons, neutrons, and, protons, collectively, chemistry, concerns, itself, with, how, electron, sharing, binds, atoms, into, structures, such, as, crystals, and, molecules, the, subatomic, particles, considered, important, in, the, understanding, of, chemistry, are, the, electron, the, proton, and, the, neutron, nuclear, physics, deals, with, how, protons, and, neutrons, arrange, themselves, in, nuclei, the, study, of, subatomic, particles, atoms, and, molecules, and, their, structure, and, interactions, requires, quantum, mechanics, analyzing, processes, that, change, the, numbers, and, types, of, particles, requires, quantum, field, theory, the, study, of, subatomic, particles, per, se, is, called, particle, physics, the, term, high, energy, physics, is, nearly, synonymous, to, particle, physics, since, creation, of, particles, requires, high, energies, it, occurs, only, as, a, result, of, cosmic, rays, or, in, particle, accelerators, particle, phenomenology, systematizes, the, knowledge, about, subatomic, particles, obtained, from, these, experiments, the, term, subatomic, particle, is, largely, a, retronym, of, the, 1960s, used, to, distinguish, a, large, number, of, baryons, and, mesons, which, comprise, hadrons, from, particles, that, are, now, thought, to, be, truly, elementary, before, that, hadrons, were, usually, classified, as, elementary, because, their, composition, was, unknown, a, list, of, important, discoveries, follows
