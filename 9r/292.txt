alchemy, from, the, arabic, word, al, k, m, is, an, ancient, branch, of, natural, philosophy, a, philosophical, and, protoscientific, tradition, that, was, historically, practised, in, china, india, the, muslim, world, and, europe, in, its, western, form, alchemy, is, first, attested, in, a, number, of, pseudepigraphical, texts, written, in, greco, roman, egypt, during, the, first, few, centuries, ad, greek, speaking, alchemists, often, referred, to, their, craft, as, the, art, or, knowledge, and, it, was, often, characterised, as, mystic, sacred, or, divine, alchemists, attempted, to, purify, mature, and, perfect, certain, materials, common, aims, were, chrysopoeia, the, transmutation, of, base, metals, e, g, lead, into, noble, metals, particularly, gold, the, creation, of, an, elixir, of, immortality, and, the, creation, of, panaceas, able, to, cure, any, disease, the, perfection, of, the, human, body, and, soul, was, thought, to, result, from, the, alchemical, magnum, opus, great, work, the, concept, of, creating, the, philosophers, stone, was, variously, connected, with, all, of, these, projects, islamic, and, european, alchemists, developed, a, basic, set, of, laboratory, techniques, theories, and, terms, some, of, which, are, still, in, use, today, they, did, not, abandon, the, ancient, greek, philosophical, idea, that, everything, is, composed, of, four, elements, and, they, tended, to, guard, their, work, in, secrecy, often, making, use, of, cyphers, and, cryptic, symbolism, in, europe, the, 12th, century, translations, of, medieval, islamic, works, on, science, and, the, rediscovery, of, aristotelian, philosophy, gave, birth, to, a, flourishing, tradition, of, latin, alchemy, this, late, medieval, tradition, of, alchemy, would, go, on, to, play, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, early, modern, science, particularly, chemistry, and, medicine, modern, discussions, of, alchemy, are, generally, split, into, an, examination, of, its, exoteric, practical, applications, and, its, esoteric, spiritual, aspects, despite, criticisms, by, scholars, such, as, eric, j, holmyard, and, marie, louise, von, franz, that, they, should, be, understood, as, complementary, the, former, is, pursued, by, historians, of, the, physical, sciences, who, examine, the, subject, in, terms, of, early, chemistry, medicine, and, charlatanism, and, the, philosophical, and, religious, contexts, in, which, these, events, occurred, the, latter, interests, historians, of, esotericism, psychologists, and, some, philosophers, and, spiritualists, the, subject, has, also, made, an, ongoing, impact, on, literature, and, the, arts, the, word, alchemy, comes, from, old, french, alquemie, alkimie, used, in, medieval, latin, as, alchymia, this, name, was, itself, adopted, from, the, arabic, word, al, k, miy, the, arabic, al, k, miy, in, turn, was, a, borrowing, of, the, late, greek, term, kh, me, a, also, spelled, khumeia, and, kh, m, a, with, al, being, the, arabic, definite, article, the, together, this, association, can, be, interpreted, as, the, process, of, transmutation, by, which, to, fuse, or, reunite, with, the, divine, or, original, form, several, etymologies, have, been, proposed, for, the, greek, term, the, first, was, proposed, by, zosimos, of, panopolis, 3rd, 4th, centuries, who, derived, it, from, the, name, of, a, book, the, khemeu, hermann, diels, argued, in, 1914, that, it, rather, derived, from, used, to, describe, metallic, objects, formed, by, casting, others, trace, its, roots, to, the, egyptian, name, k, me, hieroglyphic, khmi, meaning, black, earth, which, refers, to, the, fertile, and, auriferous, soil, of, the, nile, valley, as, opposed, to, red, desert, sand, according, to, the, egyptologist, wallis, budge, the, arabic, word, al, k, miya, actually, means, the, egyptian, borrowing, from, the, coptic, word, for, egypt, k, me, or, its, equivalent, in, the, mediaeval, bohairic, dialect, of, coptic, kh, me, this, coptic, word, derives, from, demotic, km, itself, from, ancient, egyptian, kmt, the, ancient, egyptian, word, referred, to, both, the, country, and, the, colour, black, egypt, was, the, black, land, by, contrast, with, the, red, land, the, surrounding, desert, alchemy, encompasses, several, philosophical, traditions, spanning, some, four, millennia, and, three, continents, these, traditions, general, penchant, for, cryptic, and, symbolic, language, makes, it, hard, to, trace, their, mutual, influences, and, genetic, relationships, one, can, distinguish, at, least, three, major, strands, which, appear, to, be, mostly, independent, at, least, in, their, earlier, stages, chinese, alchemy, centered, in, china, indian, alchemy, centered, on, the, indian, subcontinent, and, western, alchemy, which, occurred, around, the, mediterranean, and, whose, center, shifted, over, the, millennia, from, greco, roman, egypt, to, the, islamic, world, and, finally, medieval, europe, chinese, alchemy, was, closely, connected, to, taoism, and, indian, alchemy, with, the, dharmic, faiths, in, contrast, western, alchemy, developed, its, philosophical, system, mostly, independent, of, but, influenced, by, various, western, religions, it, is, still, an, open, question, whether, these, three, strands, share, a, common, origin, or, to, what, extent, they, influenced, each, other, the, start, of, western, alchemy, may, generally, be, traced, to, ancient, and, hellenistic, egypt, where, the, city, of, alexandria, was, a, center, of, alchemical, knowledge, and, retained, its, pre, eminence, through, most, of, the, greek, and, roman, periods, following, the, work, of, andr, jean, festugi, re, modern, scholars, see, alchemical, practice, in, the, roman, empire, as, originating, from, the, egyptian, goldsmith, s, art, greek, philosophy, and, different, religious, traditions, tracing, the, origins, of, the, alchemical, art, in, egypt, is, complicated, by, the, pseudepigraphic, nature, of, texts, from, the, greek, alchemical, corpus, the, treatises, of, zosimos, of, panopolis, the, earliest, historically, attested, author, fl, c, 300, ad, can, help, in, situating, the, other, authors, zosimus, based, his, work, on, that, of, older, alchemical, authors, such, as, mary, the, jewess, pseudo, democritus, and, agathodaimon, but, very, little, is, known, about, any, of, these, authors, the, most, complete, of, their, works, the, four, books, of, pseudo, democritus, were, probably, written, in, the, first, century, ad, recent, scholarship, tends, to, emphasize, the, testimony, of, zosimus, who, traced, the, alchemical, arts, back, to, egyptian, metallurgical, and, ceremonial, practices, it, has, also, been, argued, that, early, alchemical, writers, borrowed, the, vocabulary, of, greek, philosophical, schools, but, did, not, implement, any, of, its, doctrines, in, a, systematic, way, zosimos, of, panopolis, wrote, in, the, final, abstinence, also, known, as, the, final, count, zosimos, explains, that, the, ancient, practice, of, tinctures, the, technical, greek, name, for, the, alchemical, arts, had, been, taken, over, by, certain, demons, who, taught, the, art, only, to, those, who, offered, them, sacrifices, since, zosimos, also, called, the, demons, the, guardians, of, places, hoi, kat, t, pon, phoroi, and, those, who, offered, them, sacrifices, priests, hier, a, it, is, fairly, clear, that, he, was, referring, to, the, gods, of, egypt, and, their, priests, while, critical, of, the, kind, of, alchemy, he, associated, with, the, egyptian, priests, and, their, followers, zosimos, nonetheless, saw, the, tradition, s, recent, past, as, rooted, in, the, rites, of, the, egyptian, temples, zosimos, of, panopolis, asserted, that, alchemy, dated, back, to, pharaonic, egypt, where, it, was, the, domain, of, the, priestly, class, though, there, is, little, to, no, evidence, for, his, assertion, alchemical, writers, used, classical, figures, from, greek, roman, and, egyptian, mythology, to, illuminate, their, works, and, allegorize, alchemical, transmutation, these, included, the, pantheon, of, gods, related, to, the, classical, planets, isis, osiris, jason, and, many, others, the, central, figure, in, the, mythology, of, alchemy, is, hermes, trismegistus, or, thrice, great, hermes, his, name, is, derived, from, the, god, thoth, and, his, greek, counterpart, hermes, hermes, and, his, caduceus, or, serpent, staff, were, among, alchemy, s, principal, symbols, according, to, clement, of, alexandria, he, wrote, what, were, called, the, forty, two, books, of, hermes, covering, all, fields, of, knowledge, the, hermetica, of, thrice, great, hermes, is, generally, understood, to, form, the, basis, for, western, alchemical, philosophy, and, practice, called, the, hermetic, philosophy, by, its, early, practitioners, these, writings, were, collected, in, the, first, centuries, of, the, common, era, the, dawn, of, western, alchemy, is, sometimes, associated, with, that, of, metallurgy, extending, back, to, 3500, bc, many, writings, were, lost, when, the, roman, emperor, diocletian, ordered, the, burning, of, alchemical, books, after, suppressing, a, revolt, in, alexandria, ad, 292, few, original, egyptian, documents, on, alchemy, have, survived, most, notable, among, them, the, stockholm, papyrus, and, the, leyden, papyrus, x, dating, from, ad, 250, 300, they, contained, recipes, for, dyeing, and, making, artificial, gemstones, cleaning, and, fabricating, pearls, and, manufacturing, of, imitation, gold, and, silver, these, writings, lack, the, mystical, philosophical, elements, of, alchemy, but, do, contain, the, works, of, bolus, of, mendes, or, pseudo, democritus, which, aligned, these, recipes, with, theoretical, knowledge, of, astrology, and, the, classical, elements, between, the, time, of, bolus, and, zosimos, the, change, took, place, that, transformed, this, metallurgy, into, a, hermetic, art, alexandria, acted, as, a, melting, pot, for, philosophies, of, pythagoreanism, platonism, stoicism, and, gnosticism, which, formed, the, origin, of, alchemy, s, character, an, important, example, of, alchemy, s, roots, in, greek, philosophy, originated, by, empedocles, and, developed, by, aristotle, was, that, all, things, in, the, universe, were, formed, from, only, four, elements, earth, air, water, and, fire, according, to, aristotle, each, element, had, a, sphere, to, which, it, belonged, and, to, which, it, would, return, if, left, undisturbed, the, four, elements, of, the, greek, were, mostly, qualitative, aspects, of, matter, not, quantitative, as, our, modern, elements, are, true, alchemy, never, regarded, earth, air, water, and, fire, as, corporeal, or, chemical, substances, in, the, present, day, sense, of, the, word, the, four, elements, are, simply, the, primary, and, most, general, qualities, by, means, of, which, the, amorphous, and, purely, quantitative, substance, of, all, bodies, first, reveals, itself, in, differentiated, form, later, alchemists, extensively, developed, the, mystical, aspects, of, this, concept, alchemy, coexisted, alongside, emerging, christianity, lactantius, believed, hermes, trismegistus, had, prophesied, its, birth, st, augustine, later, affirmed, this, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, but, also, condemned, trismegistus, for, idolatry, examples, of, pagan, christian, and, jewish, alchemists, can, be, found, during, this, period, most, of, the, greco, roman, alchemists, preceding, zosimos, are, known, only, by, pseudonyms, such, as, moses, isis, cleopatra, democritus, and, ostanes, others, authors, such, as, komarios, and, chymes, we, only, know, through, fragments, of, text, after, ad, 400, greek, alchemical, writers, occupied, themselves, solely, in, commenting, on, the, works, of, these, predecessors, by, the, middle, of, the, 7th, century, alchemy, was, almost, an, entirely, mystical, discipline, it, was, at, that, time, that, khalid, ibn, yazid, sparked, its, migration, from, alexandria, to, the, islamic, world, facilitating, the, translation, and, preservation, of, greek, alchemical, texts, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, greek, alchemy, was, preserved, in, medieval, byzantine, manuscripts, after, the, fall, of, egypt, and, yet, historians, have, only, relatively, recently, begun, to, pay, attention, to, the, study, and, development, of, greek, alchemy, in, the, byzantine, period, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, text, vedas, describe, a, connection, between, eternal, life, and, gold, a, considerable, knowledge, of, metallurgy, has, been, exhibited, in, a, third, century, ad, text, called, arthashastra, which, provides, ingredients, of, explosives, agniyoga, and, salts, extracted, from, fertile, soils, and, plant, remains, yavakshara, such, as, saltpetre, nitre, perfume, making, different, qualities, of, perfumes, are, mentioned, granulated, refined, sugar, buddhist, texts, from, the, 2nd, to, 5th, centuries, mention, the, transmutation, of, base, metals, to, gold, according, to, some, scholars, greek, alchemy, may, have, influenced, indian, alchemy, but, there, are, no, hard, evidences, to, back, this, claim, the, 11th, century, persian, chemist, and, physician, ab, rayh, n, b, r, n, who, visited, gujarat, as, part, of, the, court, of, mahmud, of, ghazni, reported, that, they, have, a, science, similar, to, alchemy, which, is, quite, peculiar, to, them, which, in, sanskrit, is, called, ras, yana, and, in, persian, rasav, tam, it, means, the, art, of, obtaining, manipulating, rasa, nectar, mercury, and, juice, this, art, was, restricted, to, certain, operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and, medicines, many, of, which, have, mercury, as, their, core, element, its, principles, restored, the, health, of, those, who, were, ill, beyond, hope, and, gave, back, youth, to, fading, old, age, the, goals, of, alchemy, in, india, included, the, creation, of, a, divine, body, sanskrit, divya, deham, and, immortality, while, still, embodied, sanskrit, j, van, mukti, sanskrit, alchemical, texts, include, much, material, on, the, manipulation, of, mercury, and, sulphur, that, are, homologized, with, the, semen, of, the, god, iva, and, the, menstrual, blood, of, the, goddess, dev, some, early, alchemical, writings, seem, to, have, their, origins, in, the, kaula, tantric, schools, associated, to, the, teachings, of, the, personality, of, matsyendranath, other, early, writings, are, found, in, the, jaina, medical, treatise, kaly, ak, rakam, of, ugr, ditya, written, in, south, india, in, the, early, 9th, century, two, famous, early, indian, alchemical, authors, were, n, g, rjuna, siddha, and, nityan, tha, siddha, n, g, rjuna, siddha, was, a, buddhist, monk, his, book, rasendramangalam, is, an, example, of, indian, alchemy, and, medicine, nityan, tha, siddha, wrote, rasaratn, kara, also, a, highly, influential, work, in, sanskrit, rasa, translates, to, mercury, and, n, g, rjuna, siddha, was, said, to, have, developed, a, method, of, converting, mercury, into, gold, scholarship, on, indian, alchemy, is, in, the, publication, of, the, alchemical, body, by, david, gordon, white, a, modern, bibliography, on, indian, alchemical, studies, has, been, written, by, white, the, contents, of, 39, sanskrit, alchemical, treatises, have, been, analysed, in, detail, in, g, jan, meulenbeld, s, history, of, indian, medical, literature, the, discussion, of, these, works, in, himl, gives, a, summary, of, the, contents, of, each, work, their, special, features, and, where, possible, the, evidence, concerning, their, dating, chapter, 13, of, himl, various, works, on, rasa, stra, and, ratna, stra, or, various, works, on, alchemy, and, gems, gives, brief, details, of, a, further, 655, six, hundred, and, fifty, five, treatises, in, some, cases, meulenbeld, gives, notes, on, the, contents, and, authorship, of, these, works, in, other, cases, references, are, made, only, to, the, unpublished, manuscripts, of, these, titles, a, great, deal, remains, to, be, discovered, about, indian, alchemical, literature, the, content, of, the, sanskrit, alchemical, corpus, has, not, yet, 2014, been, adequately, integrated, into, the, wider, general, history, of, alchemy, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, focus, of, alchemical, development, moved, to, the, islamic, world, much, more, is, known, about, islamic, alchemy, because, it, was, better, documented, indeed, most, of, the, earlier, writings, that, have, come, down, through, the, years, were, preserved, as, arabic, translations, the, word, alchemy, itself, was, derived, from, the, arabic, word, al, k, miy, the, early, islamic, world, was, a, melting, pot, for, alchemy, platonic, and, aristotelian, thought, which, had, already, been, somewhat, appropriated, into, hermetical, science, continued, to, be, assimilated, during, the, late, 7th, and, early, 8th, centuries, through, syriac, translations, and, scholarship, in, the, late, ninth, and, early, tenth, centuries, the, arabic, works, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, hayy, n, latinized, as, geber, or, geberus, introduced, a, new, approach, to, alchemy, paul, kraus, who, wrote, the, standard, reference, work, on, jabir, put, it, as, follows, to, form, an, idea, of, the, historical, place, of, jabir, s, alchemy, and, to, tackle, the, problem, of, its, sources, it, is, advisable, to, compare, it, with, what, remains, to, us, of, the, alchemical, literature, in, the, greek, language, one, knows, in, which, miserable, state, this, literature, reached, us, collected, by, byzantine, scientists, from, the, tenth, century, the, corpus, of, the, greek, alchemists, is, a, cluster, of, incoherent, fragments, going, back, to, all, the, times, since, the, third, century, until, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, the, efforts, of, berthelot, and, ruelle, to, put, a, little, order, in, this, mass, of, literature, led, only, to, poor, results, and, the, later, researchers, among, them, in, particular, mrs, hammer, jensen, tannery, lagercrantz, von, lippmann, reitzenstein, ruska, bidez, festugi, re, and, others, could, make, clear, only, few, points, of, detail, the, study, of, the, greek, alchemists, is, not, very, encouraging, an, even, surface, examination, of, the, greek, texts, shows, that, a, very, small, part, only, was, organized, according, to, true, experiments, of, laboratory, even, the, supposedly, technical, writings, in, the, state, where, we, find, them, today, are, unintelligible, nonsense, which, refuses, any, interpretation, it, is, different, with, jabir, s, alchemy, the, relatively, clear, description, of, the, processes, and, the, alchemical, apparati, the, methodical, classification, of, the, substances, mark, an, experimental, spirit, which, is, extremely, far, away, from, the, weird, and, odd, esotericism, of, the, greek, texts, the, theory, on, which, jabir, supports, his, operations, is, one, of, clearness, and, of, an, impressive, unity, more, than, with, the, other, arab, authors, one, notes, with, him, a, balance, between, theoretical, teaching, and, practical, teaching, between, the, ilm, and, the, amal, in, vain, one, would, seek, in, the, greek, texts, a, work, as, systematic, as, that, which, is, presented, for, example, in, the, book, of, seventy, islamic, philosophers, also, made, great, contributions, to, alchemical, hermeticism, the, most, influential, author, in, this, regard, was, arguably, jabir, jabir, s, ultimate, goal, was, takwin, the, artificial, creation, of, life, in, the, alchemical, laboratory, up, to, and, including, human, life, he, analysed, each, aristotelian, element, in, terms, of, four, basic, qualities, of, hotness, coldness, dryness, and, moistness, according, to, jabir, in, each, metal, two, of, these, qualities, were, interior, and, two, were, exterior, for, example, lead, was, externally, cold, and, dry, while, gold, was, hot, and, moist, thus, jabir, theorized, by, rearranging, the, qualities, of, one, metal, a, different, metal, would, result, by, this, reasoning, the, search, for, the, philosopher, s, stone, was, introduced, to, western, alchemy, jabir, developed, an, elaborate, numerology, whereby, the, root, letters, of, a, substance, s, name, in, arabic, when, treated, with, various, transformations, held, correspondences, to, the, element, s, physical, properties, the, elemental, system, used, in, medieval, alchemy, also, originated, with, jabir, his, original, system, consisted, of, seven, elements, which, included, the, five, classical, elements, aether, air, earth, fire, and, water, in, addition, to, two, chemical, elements, representing, the, metals, sulphur, the, stone, which, burns, which, characterized, the, principle, of, combustibility, and, mercury, which, contained, the, idealized, principle, of, metallic, properties, shortly, thereafter, this, evolved, into, eight, elements, with, the, arabic, concept, of, the, three, metallic, principles, sulphur, giving, flammability, or, combustion, mercury, giving, volatility, and, stability, and, salt, giving, solidity, the, atomic, theory, of, corpuscularianism, where, all, physical, bodies, possess, an, inner, and, outer, layer, of, minute, particles, or, corpuscles, also, has, its, origins, in, the, work, of, jabir, from, the, 9th, to, 14th, centuries, alchemical, theories, faced, criticism, from, a, variety, of, practical, muslim, chemists, including, alkindus, ab, al, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, avicenna, and, ibn, khaldun, in, particular, they, wrote, refutations, against, the, idea, of, the, transmutation, of, metals, from, the, 14th, century, onwards, many, materials, and, practices, originally, belonging, to, indian, alchemy, rasayana, were, assimilated, in, the, persian, texts, written, by, muslim, scholars, researchers, have, found, evidence, that, chinese, alchemists, and, philosophers, discovered, complex, mathematical, phenomena, that, were, shared, with, arab, alchemists, during, the, medieval, period, discovered, in, bc, china, the, magic, square, of, three, was, propagated, to, followers, of, ab, m, s, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, at, some, point, over, the, proceeding, several, hundred, years, other, commonalities, shared, between, the, two, alchemical, schools, of, thought, include, discrete, naming, for, ingredients, and, heavy, influence, from, the, natural, elements, the, silk, road, provided, a, clear, path, for, the, exchange, of, goods, ideas, ingredients, religion, and, many, other, aspects, of, life, with, which, alchemy, is, intertwined, whereas, european, alchemy, eventually, centered, on, the, transmutation, of, base, metals, into, noble, metals, chinese, alchemy, had, a, more, obvious, connection, to, medicine, the, philosopher, s, stone, of, european, alchemists, can, be, compared, to, the, grand, elixir, of, immortality, sought, by, chinese, alchemists, in, the, hermetic, view, these, two, goals, were, not, unconnected, and, the, philosopher, s, stone, was, often, equated, with, the, universal, panacea, therefore, the, two, traditions, may, have, had, more, in, common, than, initially, appears, as, early, as, 317, ad, ge, hong, documented, the, use, of, metals, minerals, and, elixirs, in, early, chinese, medicine, hong, identified, three, ancient, chinese, documents, titled, scripture, of, great, clarity, scripture, of, the, nine, elixirs, and, scripture, of, the, golden, liquor, as, texts, containing, fundamental, alchemical, information, he, also, described, alchemy, along, with, meditation, as, the, sole, spiritual, practices, that, could, allow, one, to, gain, immortality, or, to, transcend, in, his, work, inner, chapters, of, the, book, of, the, master, who, embraces, spontaneous, nature, 317, ad, hong, argued, that, alchemical, solutions, such, as, elixirs, were, preferable, to, traditional, medicinal, treatment, due, to, the, spiritual, protection, they, could, provide, in, the, centuries, following, ge, hong, s, death, the, emphasis, placed, on, alchemy, as, a, spiritual, practice, among, chinese, daoists, was, reduced, in, 499, ad, tao, hongjing, refuted, hong, s, statement, that, alchemy, is, as, important, a, spiritual, practice, as, shangqing, meditation, while, hongjing, did, not, deny, the, power, of, alchemical, elixirs, to, grant, immortality, or, provide, divine, protection, he, ultimately, found, the, scripture, of, the, nine, elixirs, to, be, ambiguous, and, spiritually, unfulfilling, aiming, to, implement, more, accessible, practising, techniques, in, the, early, 700s, neidan, also, known, as, internal, alchemy, was, adopted, by, daoists, as, a, new, form, of, alchemy, neidan, emphasized, appeasing, the, inner, gods, that, inhabit, the, human, body, by, practising, alchemy, with, compounds, found, in, the, body, rather, than, the, mixing, of, natural, resources, that, was, emphasized, in, early, dao, alchemy, for, example, saliva, was, often, considered, nourishment, for, the, inner, gods, and, did, not, require, any, conscious, alchemical, reaction, to, produce, the, inner, gods, were, not, thought, of, as, physical, presences, occupying, each, person, but, rather, a, collection, of, deities, that, are, each, said, to, represent, and, protect, a, specific, body, part, or, region, although, those, who, practised, neidan, prioritized, meditation, over, external, alchemical, strategies, many, of, the, same, elixirs, and, constituents, from, previous, daoist, alchemical, schools, of, thought, continued, to, be, utilized, in, tandem, with, meditation, eternal, life, remained, a, consideration, for, neidan, alchemists, as, it, was, believed, that, one, would, become, immortal, if, an, inner, god, were, to, be, immortalized, within, them, through, spiritual, fulfilment, black, powder, may, have, been, an, important, invention, of, chinese, alchemists, it, is, said, that, the, chinese, invented, gunpowder, while, trying, to, find, a, potion, for, eternal, life, described, in, 9th, century, texts, and, used, in, fireworks, in, china, by, the, 10th, century, it, was, used, in, cannons, by, 1290, from, china, the, use, of, gunpowder, spread, to, japan, the, mongols, the, muslim, world, and, europe, gunpowder, was, used, by, the, mongols, against, the, hungarians, in, 1241, and, in, europe, by, the, 14th, century, chinese, alchemy, was, closely, connected, to, taoist, forms, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, such, as, acupuncture, and, moxibustion, in, the, early, song, dynasty, followers, of, this, taoist, idea, chiefly, the, elite, and, upper, class, would, ingest, mercuric, sulfide, which, though, tolerable, in, low, levels, led, many, to, suicide, thinking, that, this, consequential, death, would, lead, to, freedom, and, access, to, the, taoist, heavens, the, ensuing, deaths, encouraged, people, to, eschew, this, method, of, alchemy, in, favour, of, external, sources, the, aforementioned, tai, chi, chuan, mastering, of, the, qi, etc, chinese, alchemy, was, introduced, to, the, west, by, obed, simon, johnson, the, introduction, of, alchemy, to, latin, europe, may, be, dated, to, 11, february, 1144, with, the, completion, of, robert, of, chester, s, translation, of, the, liber, de, compositione, alchemiae, book, on, the, composition, of, alchemy, from, an, arabic, work, attributed, to, khalid, ibn, yazid, although, european, craftsmen, and, technicians, pre, existed, robert, notes, in, his, preface, that, alchemy, here, still, referring, to, the, elixir, rather, than, to, the, art, itself, was, unknown, in, latin, europe, at, the, time, of, his, writing, the, translation, of, arabic, texts, concerning, numerous, disciplines, including, alchemy, flourished, in, 12th, century, toledo, spain, through, contributors, like, gerard, of, cremona, and, adelard, of, bath, translations, of, the, time, included, the, turba, philosophorum, and, the, works, of, avicenna, and, muhammad, ibn, zakariya, al, razi, these, brought, with, them, many, new, words, to, the, european, vocabulary, for, which, there, was, no, previous, latin, equivalent, alcohol, carboy, elixir, and, athanor, are, examples, meanwhile, theologian, contemporaries, of, the, translators, made, strides, towards, the, reconciliation, of, faith, and, experimental, rationalism, thereby, priming, europe, for, the, influx, of, alchemical, thought, the, 11th, century, st, anselm, put, forth, the, opinion, that, faith, and, rationalism, were, compatible, and, encouraged, rationalism, in, a, christian, context, in, the, early, 12th, century, peter, abelard, followed, anselm, s, work, laying, down, the, foundation, for, acceptance, of, aristotelian, thought, before, the, first, works, of, aristotle, had, reached, the, west, in, the, early, 13th, century, robert, grosseteste, used, abelard, s, methods, of, analysis, and, added, the, use, of, observation, experimentation, and, conclusions, when, conducting, scientific, investigations, grosseteste, also, did, much, work, to, reconcile, platonic, and, aristotelian, thinking, through, much, of, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, alchemical, knowledge, in, europe, remained, centered, on, translations, and, new, latin, contributions, were, not, made, the, efforts, of, the, translators, were, succeeded, by, that, of, the, encyclopaedists, in, the, 13th, century, albertus, magnus, and, roger, bacon, were, the, most, notable, of, these, their, work, summarizing, and, explaining, the, newly, imported, alchemical, knowledge, in, aristotelian, terms, albertus, magnus, a, dominican, friar, is, known, to, have, written, works, such, as, the, book, of, minerals, where, he, observed, and, commented, on, the, operations, and, theories, of, alchemical, authorities, like, hermes, trismegistus, pseudo, democritus, and, unnamed, alchemists, of, his, time, albertus, critically, compared, these, to, the, writings, of, aristotle, and, avicenna, where, they, concerned, the, transmutation, of, metals, from, the, time, shortly, after, his, death, through, to, the, 15th, century, more, than, 28, alchemical, tracts, were, misattributed, to, him, a, common, practice, giving, rise, to, his, reputation, as, an, accomplished, alchemist, likewise, alchemical, texts, have, been, attributed, to, albert, s, student, thomas, aquinas, roger, bacon, a, franciscan, friar, who, wrote, on, a, wide, variety, of, topics, including, optics, comparative, linguistics, and, medicine, composed, his, great, work, latin, opus, majus, for, pope, clement, iv, as, part, of, a, project, towards, rebuilding, the, medieval, university, curriculum, to, include, the, new, learning, of, his, time, while, alchemy, was, not, more, important, to, him, than, other, sciences, and, he, did, not, produce, allegorical, works, on, the, topic, he, did, consider, it, and, astrology, to, be, important, parts, of, both, natural, philosophy, and, theology, and, his, contributions, advanced, alchemy, s, connections, to, soteriology, and, christian, theology, bacon, s, writings, integrated, morality, salvation, alchemy, and, the, prolongation, of, life, his, correspondence, with, clement, highlighted, this, noting, the, importance, of, alchemy, to, the, papacy, like, the, greeks, before, him, bacon, acknowledged, the, division, of, alchemy, into, practical, and, theoretical, spheres, he, noted, that, the, theoretical, lay, outside, the, scope, of, aristotle, the, natural, philosophers, and, all, latin, writers, of, his, time, the, practical, confirmed, the, theoretical, and, bacon, advocated, its, uses, in, natural, science, and, medicine, in, later, european, legend, he, became, an, archmage, in, particular, along, with, albertus, magnus, he, was, credited, with, the, forging, of, a, brazen, head, capable, of, answering, its, owner, s, questions, soon, after, bacon, the, influential, work, of, pseudo, geber, sometimes, identified, as, paul, of, taranto, appeared, his, summa, perfectionis, remained, a, staple, summary, of, alchemical, practice, and, theory, through, the, medieval, and, renaissance, periods, it, was, notable, for, its, inclusion, of, practical, chemical, operations, alongside, sulphur, mercury, theory, and, the, unusual, clarity, with, which, they, were, described, by, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, alchemy, had, developed, into, a, fairly, structured, system, of, belief, adepts, believed, in, the, macrocosm, microcosm, theories, of, hermes, that, is, to, say, they, believed, that, processes, that, affect, minerals, and, other, substances, could, have, an, effect, on, the, human, body, for, example, if, one, could, learn, the, secret, of, purifying, gold, one, could, use, the, technique, to, purify, the, human, soul, they, believed, in, the, four, elements, and, the, four, qualities, as, described, above, and, they, had, a, strong, tradition, of, cloaking, their, written, ideas, in, a, labyrinth, of, coded, jargon, set, with, traps, to, mislead, the, uninitiated, finally, the, alchemists, practised, their, art, they, actively, experimented, with, chemicals, and, made, observations, and, theories, about, how, the, universe, operated, their, entire, philosophy, revolved, around, their, belief, that, man, s, soul, was, divided, within, himself, after, the, fall, of, adam, by, purifying, the, two, parts, of, man, s, soul, man, could, be, reunited, with, god, in, the, 14th, century, alchemy, became, more, accessible, to, europeans, outside, the, confines, of, latin, speaking, churchmen, and, scholars, alchemical, discourse, shifted, from, scholarly, philosophical, debate, to, an, exposed, social, commentary, on, the, alchemists, themselves, dante, piers, plowman, and, chaucer, all, painted, unflattering, pictures, of, alchemists, as, thieves, and, liars, pope, john, xxii, s, 1317, edict, spondent, quas, non, exhibent, forbade, the, false, promises, of, transmutation, made, by, pseudo, alchemists, roman, catholic, inquisitor, general, nicholas, eymerich, s, directorium, inquisitorum, written, in, 1376, associated, alchemy, with, the, performance, of, demonic, rituals, which, eymerich, differentiated, from, magic, performed, in, accordance, with, scripture, this, did, not, however, lead, to, any, change, in, the, inquisition, s, monitoring, or, prosecution, of, alchemists, in, 1403, henry, iv, of, england, banned, the, practice, of, multiplying, metals, although, it, was, possible, to, buy, a, licence, to, attempt, to, make, gold, alchemically, and, a, number, were, granted, by, henry, vi, and, edward, iv, these, critiques, and, regulations, centered, more, around, pseudo, alchemical, charlatanism, than, the, actual, study, of, alchemy, which, continued, with, an, increasingly, christian, tone, the, 14th, century, saw, the, christian, imagery, of, death, and, resurrection, employed, in, the, alchemical, texts, of, petrus, bonus, john, of, rupescissa, and, in, works, written, in, the, name, of, raymond, lull, and, arnold, of, villanova, nicolas, flamel, is, a, well, known, alchemist, to, the, point, where, he, had, many, pseudepigraphic, imitators, although, the, historical, flamel, existed, the, writings, and, legends, assigned, to, him, only, appeared, in, 1612, a, common, idea, in, european, alchemy, in, the, medieval, era, was, a, metaphysical, homeric, chain, of, wise, men, that, link, heaven, and, earth, that, included, ancient, pagan, philosophers, and, other, important, historical, figures, during, the, renaissance, hermetic, and, platonic, foundations, were, restored, to, european, alchemy, the, dawn, of, medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and, entrepreneurial, branches, of, alchemy, followed, in, the, late, 15th, century, marsilio, ficino, translated, the, corpus, hermeticum, and, the, works, of, plato, into, latin, these, were, previously, unavailable, to, europeans, who, for, the, first, time, had, a, full, picture, of, the, alchemical, theory, that, bacon, had, declared, absent, renaissance, humanism, and, renaissance, neoplatonism, guided, alchemists, away, from, physics, to, refocus, on, mankind, as, the, alchemical, vessel, esoteric, systems, developed, that, blended, alchemy, into, a, broader, occult, hermeticism, fusing, it, with, magic, astrology, and, christian, cabala, a, key, figure, in, this, development, was, german, heinrich, cornelius, agrippa, 1486, 1535, who, received, his, hermetic, education, in, italy, in, the, schools, of, the, humanists, in, his, de, occulta, philosophia, he, attempted, to, merge, kabbalah, hermeticism, and, alchemy, he, was, instrumental, in, spreading, this, new, blend, of, hermeticism, outside, the, borders, of, italy, paracelsus, philippus, aureolus, theophrastus, bombastus, von, hohenheim, 1493, 1541, cast, alchemy, into, a, new, form, rejecting, some, of, agrippa, s, occultism, and, moving, away, from, chrysopoeia, paracelsus, pioneered, the, use, of, chemicals, and, minerals, in, medicine, and, wrote, many, have, said, of, alchemy, that, it, is, for, the, making, of, gold, and, silver, for, me, such, is, not, the, aim, but, to, consider, only, what, virtue, and, power, may, lie, in, medicines, his, hermetical, views, were, that, sickness, and, health, in, the, body, relied, on, the, harmony, of, man, the, microcosm, and, nature, the, macrocosm, he, took, an, approach, different, from, those, before, him, using, this, analogy, not, in, the, manner, of, soul, purification, but, in, the, manner, that, humans, must, have, certain, balances, of, minerals, in, their, bodies, and, that, certain, illnesses, of, the, body, had, chemical, remedies, that, could, cure, them, iatrochemistry, refers, to, the, pharmaceutical, applications, of, alchemy, championed, by, paracelsus, john, dee, 13, july, 1527, december, 1608, followed, agrippa, s, occult, tradition, although, better, known, for, angel, summoning, divination, and, his, role, as, astrologer, cryptographer, and, consultant, to, queen, elizabeth, i, dee, s, alchemical, monas, hieroglyphica, written, in, 1564, was, his, most, popular, and, influential, work, his, writing, portrayed, alchemy, as, a, sort, of, terrestrial, astronomy, in, line, with, the, hermetic, axiom, as, above, so, below, during, the, 17th, century, a, short, lived, supernatural, interpretation, of, alchemy, became, popular, including, support, by, fellows, of, the, royal, society, robert, boyle, and, elias, ashmole, proponents, of, the, supernatural, interpretation, of, alchemy, believed, that, the, philosopher, s, stone, might, be, used, to, summon, and, communicate, with, angels, entrepreneurial, opportunities, were, common, for, the, alchemists, of, renaissance, europe, alchemists, were, contracted, by, the, elite, for, practical, purposes, related, to, mining, medical, services, and, the, production, of, chemicals, medicines, metals, and, gemstones, rudolf, ii, holy, roman, emperor, in, the, late, 16th, century, famously, received, and, sponsored, various, alchemists, at, his, court, in, prague, including, dee, and, his, associate, edward, kelley, king, james, iv, of, scotland, julius, duke, of, brunswick, l, neburg, henry, v, duke, of, brunswick, l, neburg, augustus, elector, of, saxony, julius, echter, von, mespelbrunn, and, maurice, landgrave, of, hesse, kassel, all, contracted, alchemists, john, s, son, arthur, dee, worked, as, a, court, physician, to, michael, i, of, russia, and, charles, i, of, england, but, also, compiled, the, alchemical, book, fasciculus, chemicus, although, most, of, these, appointments, were, legitimate, the, trend, of, pseudo, alchemical, fraud, continued, through, the, renaissance, betr, ger, would, use, sleight, of, hand, or, claims, of, secret, knowledge, to, make, money, or, secure, patronage, legitimate, mystical, and, medical, alchemists, such, as, michael, maier, and, heinrich, khunrath, wrote, about, fraudulent, transmutations, distinguishing, themselves, from, the, con, artists, false, alchemists, were, sometimes, prosecuted, for, fraud, the, terms, chemia, and, alchemia, were, used, as, synonyms, in, the, early, modern, period, and, the, differences, between, alchemy, chemistry, and, small, scale, assaying, and, metallurgy, were, not, as, neat, as, in, the, present, day, there, were, important, overlaps, between, practitioners, and, trying, to, classify, them, into, alchemists, chemists, and, craftsmen, is, anachronistic, for, example, tycho, brahe, 1546, 1601, an, alchemist, better, known, for, his, astronomical, and, astrological, investigations, had, a, laboratory, built, at, his, uraniborg, observatory, research, institute, michael, sendivogius, micha, s, dziw, j, 1566, 1636, a, polish, alchemist, philosopher, medical, doctor, and, pioneer, of, chemistry, wrote, mystical, works, but, is, also, credited, with, distilling, oxygen, in, a, lab, sometime, around, 1600, sendivogious, taught, his, technique, to, cornelius, drebbel, who, in, 1621, applied, this, in, a, submarine, isaac, newton, devoted, considerably, more, of, his, writing, to, the, study, of, alchemy, see, isaac, newton, s, occult, studies, than, he, did, to, either, optics, or, physics, other, early, modern, alchemists, who, were, eminent, in, their, other, studies, include, robert, boyle, and, jan, baptist, van, helmont, their, hermeticism, complemented, rather, than, precluded, their, practical, achievements, in, medicine, and, science, the, decline, of, european, alchemy, was, brought, about, by, the, rise, of, modern, science, with, its, emphasis, on, rigorous, quantitative, experimentation, and, its, disdain, for, ancient, wisdom, although, the, seeds, of, these, events, were, planted, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, alchemy, still, flourished, for, some, two, hundred, years, and, in, fact, may, have, reached, its, peak, in, the, 18th, century, as, late, as, 1781, james, price, claimed, to, have, produced, a, powder, that, could, transmute, mercury, into, silver, or, gold, early, modern, european, alchemy, continued, to, exhibit, a, diversity, of, theories, practices, and, purposes, scholastic, and, anti, aristotelian, paracelsian, and, anti, paracelsian, hermetic, neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and, more, plus, virtually, every, combination, and, compromise, thereof, robert, boyle, 1627, 1691, pioneered, the, scientific, method, in, chemical, investigations, he, assumed, nothing, in, his, experiments, and, compiled, every, piece, of, relevant, data, boyle, would, note, the, place, in, which, the, experiment, was, carried, out, the, wind, characteristics, the, position, of, the, sun, and, moon, and, the, barometer, reading, all, just, in, case, they, proved, to, be, relevant, this, approach, eventually, led, to, the, founding, of, modern, chemistry, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, based, on, revolutionary, discoveries, and, ideas, of, lavoisier, and, john, dalton, beginning, around, 1720, a, rigid, distinction, began, to, be, drawn, for, the, first, time, between, alchemy, and, chemistry, by, the, 1740s, alchemy, was, now, restricted, to, the, realm, of, gold, making, leading, to, the, popular, belief, that, alchemists, were, charlatans, and, the, tradition, itself, nothing, more, than, a, fraud, in, order, to, protect, the, developing, science, of, modern, chemistry, from, the, negative, censure, to, which, alchemy, was, being, subjected, academic, writers, during, the, 18th, century, scientific, enlightenment, attempted, to, divorce, and, separate, the, new, chemistry, from, the, old, practices, of, alchemy, this, move, was, mostly, successful, and, the, consequences, of, this, continued, into, the, 19th, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, during, the, occult, revival, of, the, early, 19th, century, alchemy, received, new, attention, as, an, occult, science, the, esoteric, or, occultist, school, that, arose, during, the, 19th, century, held, the, view, that, the, substances, and, operations, mentioned, in, alchemical, literature, are, to, be, interpreted, in, a, spiritual, sense, less, than, as, a, practical, tradition, or, protoscience, this, interpretation, claimed, that, the, obscure, language, of, the, alchemical, texts, which, 19th, century, practitioners, were, not, always, able, to, decipher, were, an, allegorical, guise, for, spiritual, moral, or, mystical, processes, two, seminal, figures, during, this, period, were, mary, anne, atwood, and, ethan, allen, hitchcock, who, independently, published, similar, works, regarding, spiritual, alchemy, both, rebuffed, the, growing, successes, of, chemistry, developing, a, completely, esoteric, view, of, alchemy, atwood, wrote, no, modern, art, or, chemistry, notwithstanding, all, its, surreptitious, claims, has, any, thing, in, common, with, alchemy, atwood, s, work, influenced, subsequent, authors, of, the, occult, revival, including, eliphas, levi, arthur, edward, waite, and, rudolf, steiner, hitchcock, in, his, remarks, upon, alchymists, 1855, attempted, to, make, a, case, for, his, spiritual, interpretation, with, his, claim, that, the, alchemists, wrote, about, a, spiritual, discipline, under, a, materialistic, guise, in, order, to, avoid, accusations, of, blasphemy, from, the, church, and, state, in, 1845, baron, carl, reichenbach, published, his, studies, on, odic, force, a, concept, with, some, similarities, to, alchemy, but, his, research, did, not, enter, the, mainstream, of, scientific, discussion, in, 1946, louis, cattiaux, published, the, message, retrouv, a, work, that, was, at, once, philosophical, mystical, and, highly, influenced, by, alchemy, in, his, lineage, many, researchers, including, emmanuel, and, charles, d, hooghvorst, are, updating, alchemical, studies, in, france, and, belgium, several, women, appear, in, the, earliest, history, of, alchemy, michael, maier, names, four, women, who, were, able, to, make, the, philosophers, stone, mary, the, jewess, cleopatra, the, alchemist, medera, and, taphnutia, zosimos, sister, theosebia, later, known, as, euthica, the, arab, and, isis, the, prophetess, also, played, roles, in, early, alchemical, texts, the, first, alchemist, whose, name, we, know, was, mary, the, jewess, c, 200, a, d, early, sources, claim, that, mary, or, maria, devised, a, number, of, improvements, to, alchemical, equipment, and, tools, as, well, as, novel, techniques, in, chemistry, her, best, known, advances, were, in, heating, and, distillation, processes, the, laboratory, water, bath, known, eponymously, especially, in, france, as, the, bain, marie, is, said, to, have, been, invented, or, at, least, improved, by, her, essentially, a, double, boiler, it, was, and, is, used, in, chemistry, for, processes, that, required, gentle, heating, the, tribikos, a, modified, distillation, apparatus, and, the, kerotakis, a, more, intricate, apparatus, used, especially, for, sublimations, are, two, other, advancements, in, the, process, of, distillation, that, are, credited, to, her, although, we, have, no, writing, from, mary, herself, she, is, known, from, the, early, fourth, century, writings, of, zosimos, of, panopolis, after, the, greco, roman, period, women, s, names, appear, less, frequently, in, alchemical, literature, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, and, beginning, of, the, renaissance, due, to, the, emergence, of, print, women, were, able, to, access, the, alchemical, knowledge, from, texts, of, the, preceding, centuries, caterina, sforza, the, countess, of, forl, and, lady, of, imola, is, one, of, the, few, confirmed, female, alchemists, after, mary, the, jewess, as, she, owned, an, apothecary, she, would, practice, science, and, conduct, experiments, in, her, botanic, gardens, and, laboratories, being, knowledgeable, in, alchemy, and, pharmacology, she, recorded, all, of, her, alchemical, ventures, in, a, manuscript, named, experimenti, experiments, the, manuscript, contained, more, than, four, hundred, recipes, covering, alchemy, as, well, as, cosmetics, and, medicine, one, of, these, recipes, was, for, the, water, of, talc, talc, which, makes, up, talcum, powder, is, a, mineral, which, when, combined, with, water, and, distilled, was, said, to, produce, a, solution, which, yielded, many, benefits, these, supposed, benefits, included, turning, silver, to, gold, and, rejuvenation, when, combined, with, white, wine, its, powder, form, could, be, ingested, to, counteract, poison, furthermore, if, that, powder, was, mixed, and, drunk, with, white, wine, it, was, said, to, be, a, source, of, protection, from, any, poison, sickness, or, plague, other, recipes, were, for, making, hair, dyes, lotions, lip, colours, there, was, also, information, on, how, to, treat, a, variety, of, ailments, from, fevers, and, coughs, to, epilepsy, and, cancer, in, addition, there, were, instructions, on, producing, the, quintessence, or, aether, an, elixir, which, was, believed, to, be, able, to, heal, all, sicknesses, defend, against, diseases, and, perpetuate, youthfulness, she, also, wrote, about, creating, the, illustrious, philosophers, stone, some, women, known, for, their, interest, in, alchemy, were, catherine, de, medici, the, queen, of, france, and, marie, de, medici, the, following, queen, of, france, who, carried, out, experiments, in, her, personal, laboratory, also, isabella, d, este, the, marchioness, of, mantua, made, perfumes, herself, to, serve, as, gifts, due, to, the, proliferation, in, alchemical, literature, of, pseudepigrapha, and, anonymous, works, however, it, is, difficult, to, know, which, of, the, alchemists, were, actually, women, this, contributed, to, a, broader, pattern, in, which, male, authors, credited, prominent, noblewomen, for, beauty, products, with, the, purpose, of, appealing, to, a, female, audience, for, example, in, ricettario, galante, gallant, recipe, book, the, distillation, of, lemons, and, roses, was, attributed, to, elisabetta, gonzaga, the, duchess, of, urbino, in, the, same, book, isabella, d, aragona, the, daughter, of, alfonso, ii, of, naples, is, accredited, for, recipes, involving, alum, and, mercury, ippolita, maria, sforza, is, even, referred, to, in, an, anonymous, manuscript, about, a, hand, lotion, created, with, rose, powder, and, crushed, bones, as, the, sixteenth, century, went, on, scientific, culture, flourished, and, people, began, collecting, secrets, during, this, period, secrets, referred, to, experiments, and, the, most, coveted, ones, were, not, those, which, were, bizarre, but, the, ones, which, had, been, proven, to, yield, the, desired, outcome, in, this, period, the, only, book, of, secrets, ascribed, to, a, woman, was, i, secreti, della, signora, isabella, cortese, the, secrets, of, signora, isabella, cortese, this, book, contained, information, on, how, to, turn, base, metals, into, gold, medicine, and, cosmetics, however, it, is, rumoured, that, a, man, girolamo, ruscelli, was, the, real, author, and, only, used, a, female, voice, to, attract, female, readers, in, the, nineteenth, century, mary, anne, atwood, s, a, suggestive, inquiry, into, the, hermetic, mystery, 1850, marked, the, return, of, women, during, the, occult, revival, the, history, of, alchemy, has, become, a, recognized, subject, of, academic, study, as, the, language, of, the, alchemists, is, analysed, historians, are, becoming, more, aware, of, the, connections, between, that, discipline, and, other, facets, of, western, cultural, history, such, as, the, evolution, of, science, and, philosophy, the, sociology, and, psychology, of, the, intellectual, communities, kabbalism, spiritualism, rosicrucianism, and, other, mystic, movements, institutions, involved, in, this, research, include, the, chymistry, of, isaac, newton, project, at, indiana, university, the, university, of, exeter,

regularly, on, the, topic, of, alchemy, include, ambix, published, by, the, society, for, the, history, of, alchemy, and, chemistry, and, isis, published, by, the, history, of, science, society, western, alchemical, theory, corresponds, to, the, worldview, of, late, antiquity, in, which, it, was, born, concepts, were, imported, from, neoplatonism, and, earlier, greek, cosmology, as, such, the, classical, elements, appear, in, alchemical, writings, as, do, the, seven, classical, planets, and, the, corresponding, seven, metals, of, antiquity, similarly, the, gods, of, the, roman, pantheon, who, are, associated, with, these, luminaries, are, discussed, in, alchemical, literature, the, concepts, of, prima, materia, and, anima, mundi, are, central, to, the, theory, of, the, philosopher, s, stone, the, great, work, of, alchemy, is, often, described, as, a, series, of, four, stages, represented, by, colours, due, to, the, complexity, and, obscurity, of, alchemical, literature, and, the, 18th, century, diffusion, of, remaining, alchemical, practitioners, into, the, area, of, chemistry, the, general, understanding, of, alchemy, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, was, influenced, by, several, distinct, and, radically, different, interpretations, those, focusing, on, the, exoteric, such, as, historians, of, science, lawrence, m, principe, and, william, r, newman, have, interpreted, the, decknamen, or, code, words, of, alchemy, as, physical, substances, these, scholars, have, reconstructed, physicochemical, experiments, that, they, say, are, described, in, medieval, and, early, modern, texts, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, spectrum, focusing, on, the, esoteric, scholars, such, as, florin, george, c, lian, and, anna, marie, roos, who, question, the, reading, of, principe, and, newman, interpret, these, same, decknamen, as, spiritual, religious, or, psychological, concepts, new, interpretations, of, alchemy, are, still, perpetuated, sometimes, merging, in, concepts, from, new, age, or, radical, environmentalism, movements, groups, like, the, rosicrucians, and, freemasons, have, a, continued, interest, in, alchemy, and, its, symbolism, since, the, victorian, revival, of, alchemy, occultists, reinterpreted, alchemy, as, a, spiritual, practice, involving, the, self, transformation, of, the, practitioner, and, only, incidentally, or, not, at, all, the, transformation, of, laboratory, substances, which, has, contributed, to, a, merger, of, magic, and, alchemy, in, popular, thought, in, the, eyes, of, a, variety, of, modern, esoteric, and, neo, hermetic, practitioners, alchemy, is, primarily, spiritual, in, this, interpretation, transmutation, of, lead, into, gold, is, presented, as, an, analogy, for, personal, transmutation, purification, and, perfection, according, to, this, view, early, alchemists, such, as, zosimos, of, panopolis, c, 300, ad, highlighted, the, spiritual, nature, of, the, alchemical, quest, symbolic, of, a, religious, regeneration, of, the, human, soul, this, approach, is, held, to, have, continued, in, the, middle, ages, as, metaphysical, aspects, substances, physical, states, and, material, processes, are, supposed, to, have, been, used, as, metaphors, for, spiritual, entities, spiritual, states, and, ultimately, transformation, in, this, sense, the, literal, meanings, of, alchemical, formulas, hid, a, spiritual, philosophy, in, the, neo, hermeticist, interpretation, both, the, transmutation, of, common, metals, into, gold, and, the, universal, panacea, are, held, to, symbolize, evolution, from, an, imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and, ephemeral, state, toward, a, perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and, everlasting, state, so, the, philosopher, s, stone, then, represented, a, mystic, key, that, would, make, this, evolution, possible, applied, to, the, alchemist, the, twin, goal, symbolized, their, evolution, from, ignorance, to, enlightenment, and, the, stone, represented, a, hidden, spiritual, truth, or, power, that, would, lead, to, that, goal, in, texts, that, are, believed, to, have, been, written, according, to, this, view, the, cryptic, alchemical, symbols, diagrams, and, textual, imagery, of, late, alchemical, works, are, supposed, to, contain, multiple, layers, of, meanings, allegories, and, references, to, other, equally, cryptic, works, which, must, be, laboriously, decoded, to, discover, their, true, meaning, in, his, 1766, alchemical, catechism, th, odore, henri, de, tschudi, suggested, that, the, usage, of, the, metals, was, symbolic, q, when, the, philosophers, speak, of, gold, and, silver, from, which, they, extract, their, matter, are, we, to, suppose, that, they, refer, to, the, vulgar, gold, and, silver, a, by, no, means, vulgar, silver, and, gold, are, dead, while, those, of, the, philosophers, are, full, of, life, alchemical, symbolism, has, been, important, in, analytical, psychology, and, was, revived, and, popularized, from, near, extinction, by, the, swiss, psychologist, carl, gustav, jung, jung, was, initially, confounded, and, at, odds, with, alchemy, and, its, images, but, after, being, given, a, copy, of, the, secret, of, the, golden, flower, a, chinese, alchemical, text, translated, by, his, friend, richard, wilhelm, he, discovered, a, direct, correlation, or, parallel, between, the, symbolic, images, in, the, alchemical, drawings, and, the, inner, symbolic, images, coming, up, in, his, patients, dreams, visions, or, fantasies, he, observed, these, alchemical, images, occurring, during, the, psychic, process, of, transformation, a, process, that, jung, called, individuation, specifically, he, regarded, the, conjuring, up, of, images, of, gold, or, lapis, as, symbolic, expressions, of, the, origin, and, goal, of, this, process, of, individuation, together, with, his, alchemical, mystica, soror, mystical, sister, jungian, swiss, analyst, marie, louise, von, franz, jung, began, collecting, old, alchemical, texts, compiled, a, lexicon, of, key, phrases, with, cross, references, and, pored, over, them, the, volumes, of, work, he, wrote, shed, new, light, onto, understanding, the, art, of, transubstantiation, and, renewed, alchemy, s, popularity, as, a, symbolic, process, of, coming, into, wholeness, as, a, human, being, where, opposites, are, brought, into, contact, and, inner, and, outer, spirit, and, matter, are, reunited, in, the, hieros, gamos, or, divine, marriage, his, writings, are, influential, in, general, psychology, but, especially, to, those, who, have, an, interest, in, understanding, the, importance, of, dreams, symbols, and, the, unconscious, archetypal, forces, archetypes, that, comprise, all, psychic, life, both, von, franz, and, jung, have, contributed, significantly, to, the, subject, and, work, of, alchemy, and, its, continued, presence, in, psychology, as, well, as, contemporary, culture, among, the, volumes, jung, wrote, on, alchemy, his, magnum, opus, is, volume, 14, of, his, collected, works, mysterium, coniunctionis, alchemy, has, had, a, long, standing, relationship, with, art, seen, both, in, alchemical, texts, and, in, mainstream, entertainment, literary, alchemy, appears, throughout, the, history, of, english, literature, from, shakespeare, to, j,

trend, of, alchemical, satire, that, can, still, be, seen, in, recent, fantasy, works, like, those, of, the, late, sir, terry, pratchett, another, literary, work, taking, inspiration, from, the, alchemical, tradition, is, the, 1988, novel, the, alchemist, by, brazilian, writer, paulo, coelho, visual, artists, have, had, a, similar, relationship, with, alchemy, while, some, used, it, as, a,

and, continues, to, influence, popular, performers, in, the, last, hundred, years, alchemists, have, been, portrayed, in, a, magical, and, spagyric, role, in, fantasy, fiction, film, television,
