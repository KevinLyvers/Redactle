ozone, depletion, consists, of, two, related, events, observed, since, the, late, 1970s, a, steady, lowering, of, about, four, percent, in, the, total, amount, of, ozone, in, earth, s, atmosphere, and, a, much, larger, springtime, decrease, in, stratospheric, ozone, the, ozone, layer, around, earth, s, polar, regions, the, latter, phenomenon, is, referred, to, as, the, ozone, hole, there, are, also, springtime, polar, tropospheric, ozone, depletion, events, in, addition, to, these, stratospheric, events, the, main, causes, of, ozone, depletion, and, the, ozone, hole, are, manufactured, chemicals, especially, manufactured, halocarbon, refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and, foam, blowing, agents, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, hcfcs, halons, referred, to, as, ozone, depleting, substances, ods, these, compounds, are, transported, into, the, stratosphere, by, turbulent, mixing, after, being, emitted, from, the, surface, mixing, much, faster, than, the, molecules, can, settle, once, in, the, stratosphere, they, release, atoms, from, the, halogen, group, through, photodissociation, which, catalyze, the, breakdown, of, ozone, o, 3, into, oxygen, o, 2, both, types, of, ozone, depletion, were, observed, to, increase, as, emissions, of, halocarbons, increased, ozone, depletion, and, the, ozone, hole, have, generated, worldwide, concern, over, increased, cancer, risks, and, other, negative, effects, the, ozone, layer, prevents, harmful, wavelengths, of, ultraviolet, uvb, light, from, passing, through, the, earth, s, atmosphere, these, wavelengths, cause, skin, cancer, sunburn, permanent, blindness, and, cataracts, which, were, projected, to, increase, dramatically, as, a, result, of, thinning, ozone, as, well, as, harming, plants, and, animals, these, concerns, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, montreal, protocol, in, 1987, which, bans, the, production, of, cfcs, halons, and, other, ozone, depleting, chemicals, currently, scientists, plan, to, develop, new, refrigerants, to, replace, older, ones, the, ban, came, into, effect, in, 1989, ozone, levels, stabilized, by, the, mid, 1990s, and, began, to, recover, in, the, 2000s, as, the, shifting, of, the, jet, stream, in, the, southern, hemisphere, towards, the, south, pole, has, stopped, and, might, even, be, reversing, recovery, was, projected, to, continue, over, the, next, century, with, the, ozone, hole, expected, to, reach, pre, 1980, levels, by, around, 2075, in, 2019, nasa, reported, that, the, ozone, hole, was, the, smallest, ever, since, it, was, first, discovered, in, 1982, the, un, now, projects, that, under, the, current, regulations, the, ozone, layer, will, completely, regenerate, by, 2045, the, montreal, protocol, is, considered, the, most, successful, international, environmental, agreement, to, date, three, forms, or, allotropes, of, oxygen, are, involved, in, the, ozone, oxygen, cycle, oxygen, atoms, o, or, atomic, oxygen, oxygen, gas, o, 2, or, diatomic, oxygen, and, ozone, gas, o, 3, or, triatomic, oxygen, ozone, is, formed, in, the, stratosphere, when, oxygen, gas, molecules, photodissociate, after, absorbing, uvc, photons, this, converts, a, single, o, 2, into, two, atomic, oxygen, radicals, the, atomic, oxygen, radicals, then, combine, with, separate, o, 2, molecules, to, create, two, o, 3, molecules, these, ozone, molecules, absorb, uvb, light, following, which, ozone, splits, into, a, molecule, of, o, 2, and, an, oxygen, atom, the, oxygen, atom, then, joins, up, with, an, oxygen, molecule, to, regenerate, ozone, this, is, a, continuing, process, that, terminates, when, an, oxygen, atom, recombines, with, an, ozone, molecule, to, make, two, o, 2, molecules, it, is, worth, noting, that, ozone, is, the, only, atmospheric, gas, that, absorbs, uvb, light, the, total, amount, of, ozone, in, the, stratosphere, is, determined, by, a, balance, between, photochemical, production, and, recombination, ozone, can, be, destroyed, by, a, number, of, free, radical, catalysts, the, most, important, are, the, hydroxyl, radical, oh, nitric, oxide, radical, no, chlorine, radical, cl, and, bromine, radical, br, the, dot, is, a, notation, to, indicate, that, each, species, has, an, unpaired, electron, and, is, thus, extremely, reactive, all, of, these, have, both, natural, and, man, made, sources, at, present, most, of, the, oh, and, no, in, the, stratosphere, is, naturally, occurring, but, human, activity, has, drastically, increased, the, levels, of, chlorine, and, bromine, these, elements, are, found, in, stable, organic, compounds, especially, chlorofluorocarbons, which, can, travel, to, the, stratosphere, without, being, destroyed, in, the, troposphere, due, to, their, low, reactivity, once, in, the, stratosphere, the, cl, and, br, atoms, are, released, from, the, parent, compounds, by, the, action, of, ultraviolet, light, e, g, ozone, is, a, highly, reactive, molecule, that, easily, reduces, to, the, more, stable, oxygen, form, with, the, assistance, of, a, catalyst, cl, and, br, atoms, destroy, ozone, molecules, through, a, variety, of, catalytic, cycles, in, the, simplest, example, of, such, a, cycle, a, chlorine, atom, reacts, with, an, ozone, molecule, o, 3, taking, an, oxygen, atom, to, form, chlorine, monoxide, clo, and, leaving, an, oxygen, molecule, o, 2, the, clo, can, react, with, a, second, molecule, of, ozone, releasing, the, chlorine, atom, and, yielding, two, molecules, of, oxygen, the, chemical, shorthand, for, these, gas, phase, reactions, is, the, overall, effect, is, a, decrease, in, the, amount, of, ozone, though, the, rate, of, these, processes, can, be, decreased, by, the, effects, of, null, cycles, more, complicated, mechanisms, have, also, been, discovered, that, lead, to, ozone, destruction, in, the, lower, stratosphere, a, single, chlorine, atom, would, continuously, destroy, ozone, thus, a, catalyst, for, up, to, two, years, the, time, scale, for, transport, back, down, to, the, troposphere, except, for, reactions, that, remove, it, from, this, cycle, by, forming, reservoir, species, such, as, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, and, chlorine, nitrate, clono, 2, bromine, is, even, more, efficient, than, chlorine, at, destroying, ozone, on, a, per, atom, basis, but, there, is, much, less, bromine, in, the, atmosphere, at, present, both, chlorine, and, bromine, contribute, significantly, to, overall, ozone, depletion, laboratory, studies, have, also, shown, that, fluorine, and, iodine, atoms, participate, in, analogous, catalytic, cycles, however, fluorine, atoms, react, rapidly, with, water, vapour, methane, and, hydrogen, to, form, strongly, bound, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, in, the, earth, s, stratosphere, while, organic, molecules, containing, iodine, react, so, rapidly, in, the, lower, atmosphere, that, they, do, not, reach, the, stratosphere, in, significant, quantities, a, single, chlorine, atom, is, able, to, react, with, an, average, of, 100, 000, ozone, molecules, before, it, is, removed, from, the, catalytic, cycle, this, fact, plus, the, amount, of, chlorine, released, into, the, atmosphere, yearly, by, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, and, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hcfcs, demonstrates, the, danger, of, cfcs, and, hcfcs, to, the, environment, the, ozone, hole, is, usually, measured, by, reduction, in, the, total, column, ozone, above, a, point, on, the, earth, s, surface, this, is, normally, expressed, in, dobson, units, abbreviated, as, du, the, most, prominent, decrease, in, ozone, has, been, in, the, lower, stratosphere, marked, decreases, in, column, ozone, in, the, antarctic, spring, and, early, summer, compared, to, the, early, 1970s, and, before, have, been, observed, using, instruments, such, as, the, total, ozone, mapping, spectrometer, toms, reductions, of, up, to, 70, percent, in, the, ozone, column, observed, in, the, austral, southern, hemispheric, spring, over, antarctica, and, first, reported, in, 1985, farman, et, al, are, continuing, antarctic, total, column, ozone, in, september, and, october, have, continued, to, be, 40, 50, percent, lower, than, pre, ozone, hole, values, since, the, 1990s, a, gradual, trend, toward, healing, was, reported, in, 2016, in, 2017, nasa, announced, that, the, ozone, hole, was, the, weakest, since, 1988, because, of, warm, stratospheric, conditions, it, is, expected, to, recover, around, 2070, the, amount, lost, is, more, variable, year, to, year, in, the, arctic, than, in, the, antarctic, the, greatest, arctic, declines, are, in, the, winter, and, spring, reaching, up, to, 30, percent, when, the, stratosphere, is, coldest, reactions, that, take, place, on, polar, stratospheric, clouds, pscs, play, an, important, role, in, enhancing, ozone, depletion, pscs, form, more, readily, in, the, extreme, cold, of, the, arctic, and, antarctic, stratosphere, this, is, why, ozone, holes, first, formed, and, are, deeper, over, antarctica, early, models, failed, to, take, pscs, into, account, and, predicted, a, gradual, global, depletion, which, is, why, the, sudden, antarctic, ozone, hole, was, such, a, surprise, to, many, scientists, it, is, more, accurate, to, speak, of, ozone, depletion, in, middle, latitudes, rather, than, holes, total, column, ozone, declined, below, pre, 1980, values, between, 1980, and, 1996, for, mid, latitudes, in, the, northern, mid, latitudes, it, then, increased, from, the, minimum, value, by, about, two, percent, from, 1996, to, 2009, as, regulations, took, effect, and, the, amount, of, chlorine, in, the, stratosphere, decreased, in, the, southern, hemisphere, s, mid, latitudes, total, ozone, remained, constant, over, that, time, period, there, are, no, significant, trends, in, the, tropics, largely, because, halogen, containing, compounds, have, not, had, time, to, break, down, and, release, chlorine, and, bromine, atoms, at, tropical, latitudes, large, volcanic, eruptions, have, been, shown, to, have, substantial, albeit, uneven, ozone, depleting, effects, as, observed, with, the, 1991, eruption, of, mt, pinatubo, in, the, philippines, ozone, depletion, also, explains, much, of, the, observed, reduction, in, stratospheric, and, upper, tropospheric, temperatures, the, source, of, the, warmth, of, the, stratosphere, is, the, absorption, of, uv, radiation, by, ozone, hence, reduced, ozone, leads, to, cooling, some, stratospheric, cooling, is, also, predicted, from, increases, in, greenhouse, gases, such, as, co, 2, and, cfcs, themselves, however, the, ozone, induced, cooling, appears, to, be, dominant, predictions, of, ozone, levels, remain, difficult, but, the, precision, of, models, predictions, of, observed, values, and, the, agreement, among, different, modeling, techniques, have, increased, steadily, the, world, meteorological, organization, global, ozone, research, and, monitoring, project, report, no, 44, is, strongly, in, favor, of, the, montreal, protocol, but, notes, that, a, unep, 1994, assessment, overestimated, ozone, loss, for, the, 1994, 1997, period, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, and, other, halogenated, ozone, depleting, substances, ods, are, mainly, responsible, for, man, made, chemical, ozone, depletion, the, total, amount, of, effective, halogens, chlorine, and, bromine, in, the, stratosphere, can, be, calculated, and, are, known, as, the, equivalent, effective, stratospheric, chlorine, eesc, cfcs, as, refrigerants, were, invented, by, thomas, midgley, jr, in, the, 1930s, they, were, used, in, air, conditioning, and, cooling, units, as, aerosol, spray, propellants, prior, to, the, 1970s, and, in, the, cleaning, processes, of, delicate, electronic, equipment, they, also, occur, as, by, products, of, some, chemical, processes, no, significant, natural, sources, have, ever, been, identified, for, these, compounds, their, presence, in, the, atmosphere, is, due, almost, entirely, to, human, manufacture, as, mentioned, above, when, such, ozone, depleting, chemicals, reach, the, stratosphere, they, are, dissociated, by, ultraviolet, light, to, release, chlorine, atoms, the, chlorine, atoms, act, as, a, catalyst, and, each, can, break, down, tens, of, thousands, of, ozone, molecules, before, being, removed, from, the, stratosphere, given, the, longevity, of, cfc, molecules, recovery, times, are, measured, in, decades, it, is, calculated, that, a, cfc, molecule, takes, an, average, of, about, five, to, seven, years, to, go, from, the, ground, level, up, to, the, upper, atmosphere, and, it, can, stay, there, for, about, a, century, destroying, up, to, one, hundred, thousand, ozone, molecules, during, that, time, 1, 1, 1, trichloro, 2, 2, 2, trifluoroethane, also, known, as, cfc, 113a, is, one, of, four, man, made, chemicals, newly, discovered, in, the, atmosphere, by, a, team, at, the, university, of, east, anglia, cfc, 113a, is, the, only, known, cfc, whose, abundance, in, the, atmosphere, is, still, growing, its, source, remains, a, mystery, but, illegal, manufacturing, is, suspected, by, some, cfc, 113a, seems, to, have, been, accumulating, unabated, since, 1960, between, 2012, and, 2017, concentrations, of, the, gas, jumped, by, 40, percent, a, study, by, an, international, team, of, researchers, published, in, nature, found, that, since, 2013, emissions, that, are, predominately, from, north, eastern, china, have, released, large, quantities, of, the, banned, chemical, chlorofluorocarbon, 11, cfc, 11, into, the, atmosphere, scientists, estimate, that, without, action, these, cfc, 11, emissions, will, delay, the, recovery, of, the, planet, s, ozone, hole, by, a, decade, satellites, burning, up, upon, re, entry, into, earth, s, atmosphere, produce, aluminum, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, nanoparticles, that, endure, in, the, atmosphere, for, decades, estimates, for, 2022, alone, were, 17, metric, tons, 30, kg, of, nanoparticles, per, 250, kg, satellite, increasing, populations, of, satellite, constellations, can, eventually, lead, to, significant, ozone, depletion, scientists, have, attributed, ozone, depletion, to, the, increase, of, man, made, anthropogenic, halogen, compounds, from, cfcs, by, combining, observational, data, with, computer, models, these, complex, chemistry, transport, models, e, g, slimcat, clams, chemical, lagrangian, model, of, the, stratosphere, work, by, combining, measurements, of, chemicals, and, meteorological, fields, with, chemical, reaction, rate, constants, they, identify, key, chemical, reactions, and, transport, processes, that, bring, cfc, photolysis, products, into, contact, with, ozone, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, is, an, area, of, the, antarctic, stratosphere, in, which, the, recent, ozone, levels, have, dropped, to, as, low, as, 33, percent, of, their, pre, 1975, values, the, ozone, hole, occurs, during, the, antarctic, spring, from, september, to, early, december, as, strong, westerly, winds, start, to, circulate, around, the, continent, and, create, an, atmospheric, container, within, this, polar, vortex, over, 50, percent, of, the, lower, stratospheric, ozone, is, destroyed, during, the, antarctic, spring, as, explained, above, the, primary, cause, of, ozone, depletion, is, the, presence, of, chlorine, containing, source, gases, primarily, cfcs, and, related, halocarbons, in, the, presence, of, uv, light, these, gases, dissociate, releasing, chlorine, atoms, which, then, go, on, to, catalyze, ozone, destruction, the, cl, catalyzed, ozone, depletion, can, take, place, in, the, gas, phase, but, it, is, substantially, enhanced, in, the, presence, of, polar, stratospheric, clouds, pscs, these, polar, stratospheric, clouds, form, during, winter, in, the, extreme, cold, polar, winters, are, dark, consisting, of, three, months, without, solar, radiation, sunlight, the, lack, of, sunlight, contributes, to, a, decrease, in, temperature, and, the, polar, vortex, traps, and, chills, the, air, temperatures, are, around, or, below, 80, c, these, low, temperatures, form, cloud, particles, there, are, three, types, of, psc, clouds, nitric, acid, trihydrate, clouds, slowly, cooling, water, ice, clouds, and, rapid, cooling, water, ice, nacreous, clouds, provide, surfaces, for, chemical, reactions, whose, products, will, in, the, spring, lead, to, ozone, destruction, the, photochemical, processes, involved, are, complex, but, well, understood, the, key, observation, is, that, ordinarily, most, of, the, chlorine, in, the, stratosphere, resides, in, reservoir, compounds, primarily, chlorine, nitrate, clono, 2, as, well, as, stable, end, products, such, as, hcl, the, formation, of, end, products, essentially, removes, cl, from, the, ozone, depletion, process, reservoir, compounds, sequester, cl, which, can, later, be, made, available, via, absorption, of, light, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 400, nm, during, the, antarctic, winter, and, spring, reactions, on, the, surface, of, the, polar, stratospheric, cloud, particles, convert, these, reservoir, compounds, into, reactive, free, radicals, cl, and, clo, denitrification, is, the, process, by, which, the, clouds, remove, no, 2, from, the, stratosphere, by, converting, it, to, nitric, acid, in, psc, particles, which, then, are, lost, by, sedimentation, this, prevents, newly, formed, clo, from, being, converted, back, into, clono, 2, the, role, of, sunlight, in, ozone, depletion, is, the, reason, why, the, antarctic, ozone, depletion, is, greatest, during, spring, during, winter, even, though, pscs, are, at, their, most, abundant, there, is, no, light, over, the, pole, to, drive, chemical, reactions, during, the, spring, however, sunlight, returns, and, provides, energy, to, drive, photochemical, reactions, and, melt, the, polar, stratospheric, clouds, releasing, considerable, clo, which, drives, the, hole, mechanism, further, warming, temperatures, near, the, end, of, spring, break, up, the, vortex, around, mid, december, as, warm, ozone, and, no, 2, rich, air, flows, in, from, lower, latitudes, the, pscs, are, destroyed, the, enhanced, ozone, depletion, process, shuts, down, and, the, ozone, hole, closes, most, of, the, ozone, that, is, destroyed, is, in, the, lower, stratosphere, in, contrast, to, the, much, smaller, ozone, depletion, through, homogeneous, gas, phase, reactions, which, occurs, primarily, in, the, upper, stratosphere, since, the, ozone, layer, absorbs, uvb, ultraviolet, light, from, the, sun, ozone, layer, depletion, increases, surface, uvb, levels, all, else, equal, which, could, lead, to, damage, including, an, increase, in, skin, cancer, this, was, the, reason, for, the, montreal, protocol, although, decreases, in, stratospheric, ozone, are, well, tied, to, cfcs, and, increases, in, surface, uvb, there, is, no, direct, observational, evidence, linking, ozone, depletion, to, higher, incidence, of, skin, cancer, and, eye, damage, in, human, beings, this, is, partly, because, uva, which, has, also, been, implicated, in, some, forms, of, skin, cancer, is, not, absorbed, by, ozone, and, because, it, is, nearly, impossible, to, control, statistics, for, lifestyle, changes, over, time, ozone, depletion, may, also, influence, wind, patterns, ozone, while, a, minority, constituent, in, earth, s, atmosphere, is, responsible, for, most, of, the, absorption, of, uvb, radiation, the, amount, of, uvb, radiation, that, penetrates, through, the, ozone, layer, decreases, exponentially, with, the, slant, path, thickness, and, density, of, the, layer, when, stratospheric, ozone, levels, decrease, higher, levels, of, uvb, reach, the, earth, s, surface, uv, driven, phenolic, formation, in, tree, rings, has, dated, the, start, of, ozone, depletion, in, northern, latitudes, to, the, late, 1700s, in, october, 2008, the, ecuadorian, space, agency, published, a, report, called, hiperion, the, study, used, ground, instruments, in, ecuador, and, the, last, 28, years, data, from, 12, satellites, of, several, countries, and, found, that, the, uv, radiation, reaching, equatorial, latitudes, was, far, greater, than, expected, with, the, uv, index, climbing, as, high, as, 24, in, quito, the, who, considers, 11, as, an, extreme, index, and, a, great, risk, to, health, the, report, concluded, that, depleted, ozone, levels, around, the, mid, latitudes, of, the, planet, are, already, endangering, large, populations, in, these, areas, later, the, conida, the, peruvian, space, agency, published, its, own, study, which, yielded, almost, the, same, findings, as, the, ecuadorian, study, the, main, public, concern, regarding, the, ozone, hole, has, been, the, effects, of, increased, surface, uv, radiation, on, human, health, so, far, ozone, depletion, in, most, locations, has, been, typically, a, few, percent, and, as, noted, above, no, direct, evidence, of, health, damage, is, available, in, most, latitudes, if, the, high, levels, of, depletion, seen, in, the, ozone, hole, were, to, be, common, across, the, globe, the, effects, could, be, substantially, more, dramatic, as, the, ozone, hole, over, antarctica, has, in, some, instances, grown, so, large, as, to, affect, parts, of, australia, new, zealand, chile, argentina, and, south, africa, environmentalists, have, been, concerned, that, the, increase, in, surface, uv, could, be, significant, excessive, ultraviolet, radiation, uvr, has, reducing, effects, on, the, rates, of, photosynthesis, and, growth, of, benthic, diatom, communities, microalgae, species, that, increase, water, quality, and, are, pollution, resistant, that, are, present, in, shallow, freshwater, ozone, depletion, not, only, affects, human, health, but, also, has, a, profound, impact, on, biodiversity, it, damages, plants, and, trees, at, the, cellular, level, affecting, their, growth, vitality, photosynthesis, water, balance, and, defense, mechanisms, against, pests, and, diseases, this, sets, off, a, cascade, of, ecological, impacts, harming, soil, microbes, insects, wildlife, and, entire, ecosystems, ozone, depletion, would, magnify, all, of, the, effects, of, uv, on, human, health, both, positive, including, production, of, vitamin, d, and, negative, including, sunburn, skin, cancer, and, cataracts, in, addition, increased, surface, uv, leads, to, increased, tropospheric, ozone, which, is, a, health, risk, to, humans, the, most, common, forms, of, skin, cancer, in, humans, basal, and, squamous, cell, carcinomas, have, been, strongly, linked, to, uv, b, exposure, the, mechanism, by, which, uvb, induces, these, cancers, is, well, understood, absorption, of, uv, b, radiation, causes, the, pyrimidine, bases, in, the, dna, molecule, to, form, dimers, resulting, in, transcription, errors, when, the, dna, replicates, these, cancers, are, relatively, mild, and, rarely, fatal, although, the, treatment, of, squamous, cell, carcinoma, sometimes, requires, extensive, reconstructive, surgery, by, combining, epidemiological, data, with, results, of, animal, studies, scientists, have, estimated, that, every, one, percent, decrease, in, long, term, stratospheric, ozone, would, increase, the, incidence, of, these, cancers, by, 2, another, form, of, skin, cancer, malignant, melanoma, is, much, less, common, but, far, more, dangerous, being, lethal, in, about, 15, 20, percent, of, the, cases, diagnosed, the, relationship, between, malignant, melanoma, and, ultraviolet, exposure, is, not, yet, fully, understood, but, it, appears, that, both, uv, b, and, uv, a, are, involved, because, of, this, uncertainty, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, effect, of, ozone, depletion, on, melanoma, incidence, one, study, showed, that, a, 10, percent, increase, in, uv, b, radiation, was, associated, with, a, 19, percent, increase, in, melanomas, for, men, and, 16, percent, for, women, a, study, of, people, in, punta, arenas, at, the, southern, tip, of, chile, showed, a, 56, percent, increase, in, melanoma, and, a, 46, percent, increase, in, nonmelanoma, skin, cancer, over, a, period, of, seven, years, along, with, decreased, ozone, and, increased, uvb, levels, epidemiological, studies, suggest, an, association, between, ocular, cortical, cataracts, and, uv, b, exposure, using, crude, approximations, of, exposure, and, various, cataract, assessment, techniques, a, detailed, assessment, of, ocular, exposure, to, uv, b, was, carried, out, in, a, study, on, chesapeake, bay, watermen, where, increases, in, average, annual, ocular, exposure, were, associated, with, increasing, risk, of, cortical, opacity, in, this, highly, exposed, group, of, predominantly, white, males, the, evidence, linking, cortical, opacities, to, sunlight, exposure, was, the, strongest, to, date, based, on, these, results, ozone, depletion, is, predicted, to, cause, hundreds, of, thousands, of, additional, cataracts, by, 2050, increased, surface, uv, leads, to, increased, tropospheric, ozone, ground, level, ozone, is, generally, recognized, to, be, a, health, risk, as, ozone, is, toxic, due, to, its, strong, oxidant, properties, the, risks, are, particularly, high, for, young, children, the, elderly, and, those, with, asthma, or, other, respiratory, difficulties, at, this, time, ozone, at, ground, level, is, produced, mainly, by, the, action, of, uv, radiation, on, combustion, gases, from, vehicle, exhausts, vitamin, d, is, produced, in, the, skin, by, ultraviolet, light, thus, higher, uvb, exposure, raises, human, vitamin, d, in, those, deficient, in, it, recent, research, primarily, since, the, montreal, protocol, shows, that, many, humans, have, less, than, optimal, vitamin, d, levels, in, particular, in, the, u, s, population, the, lowest, quarter, of, vitamin, d, 17, 8, ng, ml, were, found, using, information, from, the, national, health, and, nutrition, examination, survey, to, be, associated, with, an, increase, in, all, cause, mortality, in, the, general, population, while, blood, level, of, vitamin, d, in, excess, of, 100, ng, ml, appear, to, raise, blood, calcium, excessively, and, to, be, associated, with, higher, mortality, the, body, has, mechanisms, that, prevent, sunlight, from, producing, vitamin, d, in, excess, of, the, body, s, requirements, a, november, 2011, report, by, scientists, at, the, institute, of, zoology, in, london, england, found, that, whales, off, the, coast, of, california, have, shown, a, sharp, rise, in, sun, damage, and, these, scientists, fear, that, the, thinning, ozone, layer, is, to, blame, the, study, photographed, and, took, skin, biopsies, from, over, 150, whales, in, the, gulf, of, california, and, found, widespread, evidence, of, epidermal, damage, commonly, associated, with, acute, and, severe, sunburn, having, cells, that, form, when, the, dna, is, damaged, by, uv, radiation, the, findings, suggest, rising, uv, levels, as, a, result, of, ozone, depletion, are, to, blame, for, the, observed, skin, damage, in, the, same, way, that, human, skin, cancer, rates, have, been, on, the, increase, in, recent, decades, apart, from, whales, many, other, animals, such, as, dogs, cats, sheep, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, also, suffer, the, negative, effects, of, increased, uv, b, radiations, an, increase, of, uv, radiation, would, be, expected, to, affect, crops, a, number, of, economically, important, species, of, plants, such, as, rice, depend, on, cyanobacteria, residing, on, their, roots, for, the, retention, of, nitrogen, cyanobacteria, are, sensitive, to, uv, radiation, and, would, be, affected, by, its, increase, despite, mechanisms, to, reduce, or, repair, the, effects, of, increased, ultraviolet, radiation, plants, have, a, limited, ability, to, adapt, to, increased, levels, of, uvb, therefore, plant, growth, can, be, directly, affected, by, uvb, radiation, over, the, years, the, arctic, ozone, layer, has, depleted, severely, as, a, consequence, species, that, live, above, the, snow, cover, or, in, areas, where, snow, has, melted, abundantly, due, to, hot, temperatures, are, negatively, impacted, due, to, uv, radiation, that, reaches, the, ground, depletion, of, the, ozone, layer, and, allowing, excess, uvb, radiation, would, initially, be, assumed, to, increase, damage, to, plant, dna, reports, have, found, that, when, plants, are, exposed, to, uvb, radiation, similar, to, stratospheric, ozone, depletion, there, was, no, significant, change, in, plant, height, or, leaf, mass, but, showed, a, response, in, shoot, biomass, and, leaf, area, with, a, small, decrease, however, uvb, radiation, has, been, shown, to, decrease, quantum, yield, of, photosystem, ii, uvb, damage, only, occurs, under, extreme, exposure, and, most, plants, also, have, uvb, absorbing, flavonoids, which, allow, them, to, acclimatize, to, the, radiation, present, plants, experience, different, levels, of, uv, radiation, throughout, the, day, it, is, known, that, they, are, able, to, shift, the, levels, and, types, of, uv, sunscreens, i, e, flavonoids, that, they, contain, throughout, the, day, this, allows, them, to, increase, their, protection, against, uv, radiation, plants, that, have, been, affected, by, radiation, throughout, development, are, more, affected, by, the, inability, to, intercept, light, with, a, larger, leaf, area, than, having, photosynthetic, systems, compromised, damage, from, uvb, radiation, is, more, likely, to, be, significant, on, species, interactions, than, on, plants, themselves, another, significant, impact, of, ozone, depletion, on, plant, life, is, the, stress, experienced, by, plants, when, exposed, to, uv, radiation, this, can, cause, a, decrease, in, plant, growth, and, an, increase, in, oxidative, stress, due, to, the, production, of, nitric, oxide, and, hydrogen, peroxide, in, areas, where, substantial, ozone, depletion, has, occurred, increased, uv, b, radiation, reduces, terrestrial, plant, productivity, and, likewise, carbon, sequestration, by, about, 6, moreover, if, plants, are, exposed, to, high, levels, of, uv, radiation, it, can, elicit, the, production, of, harmful, volatile, organic, compounds, like, isoprenes, the, emission, of, isoprenes, into, the, air, by, plants, can, severely, impact, the, environment, by, adding, to, air, pollution, and, increasing, the, amount, of, carbon, in, the, atmosphere, ultimately, contributing, to, climate, change, the, full, extent, of, the, damage, that, cfcs, have, caused, to, the, ozone, layer, is, not, known, and, will, not, be, known, for, decades, however, marked, decreases, in, column, ozone, have, already, been, observed, the, montreal, and, vienna, conventions, were, installed, long, before, a, scientific, consensus, was, established, or, important, uncertainties, in, the, science, field, were, being, resolved, the, ozone, case, was, understood, comparably, well, by, lay, persons, as, e, g, ozone, shield, or, ozone, hole, were, useful, easy, to, understand, bridging, metaphors, americans, voluntarily, switched, away, from, aerosol, sprays, resulting, in, a, 50, percent, sales, loss, even, before, legislation, was, enforced, after, a, 1976, report, by, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, concluded, that, credible, scientific, evidence, supported, the, ozone, depletion, hypothesis, a, few, countries, including, the, united, states, canada, sweden, denmark, and, norway, moved, to, eliminate, the, use, of, cfcs, in, aerosol, spray, cans, at, the, time, this, was, widely, regarded, as, a, first, step, towards, a, more, comprehensive, regulation, policy, but, progress, in, this, direction, slowed, in, subsequent, years, due, to, a, combination, of, political, factors, continued, resistance, from, the, halocarbon, industry, and, a, general, change, in, attitude, towards, environmental, regulation, during, the, first, two, years, of, the, reagan, administration, and, scientific, developments, subsequent, national, academy, assessments, that, indicated, that, the, first, estimates, of, the, magnitude, of, ozone, depletion, had, been, overly, large, a, critical, dupont, manufacturing, patent, for, freon, was, set, to, expire, in, 1979, the, united, states, banned, the, use, of, cfcs, in, aerosol, cans, in, 1978, the, european, community, rejected, proposals, to, ban, cfcs, in, aerosol, sprays, and, in, the, u, s, cfcs, continued, to, be, used, as, refrigerants, and, for, cleaning, circuit, boards, worldwide, cfc, production, fell, sharply, after, the, u, s, aerosol, ban, but, by, 1986, had, returned, nearly, to, its, 1976, level, in, 1993, dupont, canada, closed, its, cfc, facility, the, u, s, government, s, attitude, began, to, change, again, in, 1983, when, william, ruckelshaus, replaced, anne, m, burford, as, administrator, of, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, under, ruckelshaus, and, his, successor, lee, thomas, the, epa, pushed, for, an, international, approach, to, halocarbon, regulations, in, 1985, twenty, nations, including, most, of, the, major, cfc, producers, signed, the, vienna, convention, for, the, protection, of, the, ozone, layer, which, established, a, framework, for, negotiating, international, regulations, on, ozone, depleting, substances, that, same, year, the, discovery, of, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, was, announced, causing, a, revival, in, public, attention, to, the, issue, in, 1987, representatives, from, 43, nations, signed, the, montreal, protocol, meanwhile, the, halocarbon, industry, shifted, its, position, and, started, supporting, a, protocol, to, limit, cfc, production, however, this, shift, was, uneven, with, dupont, acting, more, quickly, than, its, european, counterparts, dupont, may, have, feared, court, action, related, to, increased, skin, cancer, especially, as, the, epa, had, published, a, study, in, 1986, claiming, that, an, additional, 40, million, cases, and, 800, 000, cancer, deaths, were, to, be, expected, in, the, u, s, in, the, next, 88, years, the, eu, shifted, its, position, as, well, after, germany, gave, up, its, defence, of, the, cfc, industry, and, started, supporting, moves, towards, regulation, government, and, industry, in, france, and, the, uk, tried, to, defend, their, cfc, producing, industries, even, after, the, montreal, protocol, had, been, signed, at, montreal, the, participants, agreed, to, freeze, production, of, cfcs, at, 1986, levels, and, to, reduce, production, by, 50, percent, by, 1999, after, a, series, of, scientific, expeditions, to, the, antarctic, produced, convincing, evidence, that, the, ozone, hole, was, indeed, caused, by, chlorine, and, bromine, from, manmade, organohalogens, the, montreal, protocol, was, strengthened, at, a, 1990, meeting, in, london, the, participants, agreed, to, phase, out, cfcs, and, halons, entirely, aside, from, a, very, small, amount, marked, for, certain, essential, uses, such, as, asthma, inhalers, by, 2000, in, non, article, 5, countries, and, by, 2010, in, article, 5, less, developed, signatories, at, a, 1992, meeting, in, copenhagen, denmark, the, phase, out, date, was, moved, up, to, 1996, at, the, same, meeting, methyl, bromide, mebr, a, fumigant, used, primarily, in, agricultural, production, was, added, to, the, list, of, controlled, substances, for, all, substances, controlled, under, the, protocol, phaseout, schedules, were, delayed, for, less, developed, article, 5, 1, countries, and, phaseout, in, these, countries, was, supported, by, transfers, of, expertise, technology, and, money, from, non, article, 5, 1, parties, to, the, protocol, additionally, exemptions, from, the, agreed, schedules, could, be, applied, for, under, the, essential, use, exemption, eue, process, for, substances, other, than, methyl, bromide, and, under, the, critical, use, exemption, cue, process, for, methyl, bromide, civil, society, including, especially, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, played, critical, roles, at, all, stages, of, policy, development, leading, to, the, vienna, conference, the, montreal, protocol, and, in, assessing, compliance, afterwards, the, major, companies, claimed, that, no, alternatives, to, hfc, existed, an, ozone, safe, hydrocarbon, refrigerant, was, developed, at, a, technological, institute, in, hamburg, germany, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, the, hydrocarbon, gases, propane, and, butane, and, in, 1992, came, to, the, attention, of, the, ngo, greenpeace, greenpeace, called, it, greenfreeze, the, ngo, then, worked, successfully, first, with, a, small, and, struggling, company, to, market, an, appliance, beginning, in, europe, then, asia, and, later, latin, america, receiving, a, 1997, unep, award, by, 1995, germany, had, made, cfc, refrigerators, illegal, since, 2004, corporations, like, coca, cola, carlsberg, and, ikea, formed, a, coalition, to, promote, the, ozone, safe, greenfreeze, units, production, spread, to, companies, like, electrolux, bosch, and, lg, with, sales, reaching, some, 300, million, refrigerators, by, 2008, in, latin, america, a, domestic, argentinian, company, began, greenfreeze, production, in, 2003, while, the, giant, bosch, in, brazil, began, a, year, later, by, 2013, it, was, being, used, by, some, 700, million, refrigerators, making, up, about, 40, percent, of, the, market, in, the, u, s, however, change, has, been, much, slower, to, some, extent, cfcs, were, being, replaced, by, the, less, damaging, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hcfcs, although, concerns, remain, regarding, hcfcs, also, in, some, applications, hydrofluorocarbons, hfcs, were, being, used, to, replace, cfcs, hfcs, which, contain, no, chlorine, or, bromine, do, not, contribute, to, ozone, depletion, although, they, are, potent, greenhouse, gases, the, best, known, of, these, compounds, is, probably, hfc, 134a, r, 134a, which, in, the, united, states, has, largely, replaced, cfc, 12, r, 12, in, automobile, air, conditioners, in, laboratory, analytics, a, former, essential, use, the, ozone, depleting, substances, can, be, replaced, with, other, solvents, chemical, companies, like, du, pont, whose, representatives, disparaged, greenfreeze, as, that, german, technology, maneuvered, the, epa, to, block, the, technology, in, the, u, s, until, 2011, ben, jerry, s, of, unilever, and, general, electric, spurred, by, greenpeace, had, expressed, formal, interest, in, 2008, which, figured, in, the, epa, s, final, approval, the, eu, recast, its, ozone, regulation, in, 2009, the, law, bans, ozone, depleting, substances, with, the, goal, of, protecting, the, ozone, layer, the, list, of, ods, that, are, subject, to, the, regulation, is, the, same, as, those, under, the, montreal, protocol, with, some, additions, more, recently, policy, experts, have, advocated, for, efforts, to, link, ozone, protection, efforts, to, climate, protection, efforts, many, ods, are, also, greenhouse, gases, some, thousands, of, times, more, powerful, agents, of, radiative, forcing, than, carbon, dioxide, over, the, short, and, medium, term, thus, policies, protecting, the, ozone, layer, have, had, benefits, in, mitigating, climate, change, the, reduction, of, the, radiative, forcing, due, to, ods, probably, masked, the, true, level, of, climate, change, effects, of, other, greenhouse, gases, and, was, responsible, for, the, slow, down, of, global, warming, from, the, mid, 90s, policy, decisions, in, one, arena, affect, the, costs, and, effectiveness, of, environmental, improvements, in, the, other, the, imo, has, amended, marpol, annex, vi, regulation, 12, regarding, ozone, depleting, substances, as, from, july, 1, 2010, all, vessels, where, marpol, annex, vi, is, applicable, should, have, a, list, of, equipment, using, ozone, depleting, substances, the, list, should, include, the, name, of, ods, type, and, location, of, equipment, quantity, in, kg, and, date, all, changes, since, that, date, should, be, recorded, in, an, ods, record, book, on, board, recording, all, intended, or, unintended, releases, to, the, atmosphere, furthermore, new, ods, supply, or, landing, to, shore, facilities, should, be, recorded, as, well, since, the, adoption, and, strengthening, of, the, montreal, protocol, has, led, to, reductions, in, the, emissions, of, cfcs, atmospheric, concentrations, of, the, most, significant, compounds, have, been, declining, these, substances, are, being, gradually, removed, from, the, atmosphere, since, peaking, in, 1994, the, effective, equivalent, chlorine, eecl, level, in, the, atmosphere, had, dropped, about, 10, percent, by, 2008, the, decrease, in, ozone, depleting, chemicals, has, also, been, significantly, affected, by, a, decrease, in, bromine, containing, chemicals, the, data, suggest, that, substantial, natural, sources, exist, for, atmospheric, methyl, bromide, ch, 3, br, the, phase, out, of, cfcs, means, that, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, which, is, not, covered, by, the, montreal, protocol, has, become, the, most, highly, emitted, ozone, depleting, substance, and, is, expected, to, remain, so, throughout, the, 21st, century, according, to, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, global, stratospheric, ozone, levels, experienced, rapid, decline, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, and, have, since, been, increasing, but, have, not, reached, preindustrial, levels, although, considerable, variability, is, expected, from, year, to, year, including, in, polar, regions, where, depletion, is, largest, the, ozone, layer, is, expected, to, continue, recovering, in, coming, decades, due, to, declining, ozone, depleting, substance, concentrations, assuming, full, compliance, with, the, montreal, protocol, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, is, expected, to, continue, for, decades, ozone, concentrations, in, the, lower, stratosphere, over, antarctica, increased, by, 5, 10, percent, by, 2020, and, will, return, to, pre, 1980, levels, by, about, 2060, 2075, this, is, 10, 25, years, later, than, predicted, in, earlier, assessments, because, of, revised, estimates, of, atmospheric, concentrations, of, ozone, depleting, substances, including, a, larger, predicted, future, usage, in, developing, countries, another, factor, that, may, prolong, ozone, depletion, is, the, drawdown, of, nitrogen, oxides, from, above, the, stratosphere, due, to, changing, wind, patterns, a, gradual, trend, toward, healing, was, reported, in, 2016, in, 2019, the, ozone, hole, was, at, its, smallest, in, the, previous, thirty, years, due, to, the, warmer, polar, stratosphere, weakening, the, polar, vortex, in, september, 2023, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, was, one, of, the, largest, on, record, at, 26, million, square, kilometers, the, anomalously, large, ozone, loss, may, have, been, a, result, of, the, 2022, tonga, volcanic, eruption, the, basic, physical, and, chemical, processes, that, lead, to, the, formation, of, an, ozone, layer, in, the, earth, s, stratosphere, were, discovered, by, sydney, chapman, in, 1930, short, wavelength, uv, radiation, splits, an, oxygen, o, 2, molecule, into, two, oxygen, o, atoms, which, then, combine, with, other, oxygen, molecules, to, form, ozone, ozone, is, removed, when, an, oxygen, atom, and, an, ozone, molecule, recombine, to, form, two, oxygen, molecules, i, e, o, o, 3, 2, o, 2, in, the, 1950s, david, bates, and, marcel, nicolet, presented, evidence, that, various, free, radicals, in, particular, hydroxyl, oh, and, nitric, oxide, no, could, catalyze, this, recombination, reaction, reducing, the, overall, amount, of, ozone, these, free, radicals, were, known, to, be, present, in, the, stratosphere, and, so, were, regarded, as, part, of, the, natural, balance, it, was, estimated, that, in, their, absence, the, ozone, layer, would, be, about, twice, as, thick, as, it, currently, is, in, 1970, paul, crutzen, pointed, out, that, emissions, of, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, a, stable, long, lived, gas, produced, by, soil, bacteria, from, the, earth, s, surface, could, affect, the, amount, of, nitric, oxide, no, in, the, stratosphere, crutzen, showed, that, nitrous, oxide, lives, long, enough, to, reach, the, stratosphere, where, it, is, converted, into, no, crutzen, then, noted, that, increasing, use, of, fertilizers, might, have, led, to, an, increase, in, nitrous, oxide, emissions, over, the, natural, background, which, would, in, turn, result, in, an, increase, in, the, amount, of, no, in, the, stratosphere, thus, human, activity, could, affect, the, stratospheric, ozone, layer, in, the, following, year, crutzen, and, independently, harold, johnston, suggested, that, no, emissions, from, supersonic, passenger, aircraft, which, would, fly, in, the, lower, stratosphere, could, also, deplete, the, ozone, layer, however, more, recent, analysis, in, 1995, by, david, w, fahey, an, atmospheric, scientist, at, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, found, that, the, drop, in, ozone, would, be, from, 1, 2, percent, if, a, fleet, of, 500, supersonic, passenger, aircraft, were, operated, this, fahey, expressed, would, not, be, a, showstopper, for, advanced, supersonic, passenger, aircraft, development, in, 1974, frank, sherwood, rowland, chemistry, professor, at, the, university, of, california, at, irvine, and, his, postdoctoral, associate, mario, j, molina, suggested, that, long, lived, organic, halogen, compounds, such, as, cfcs, might, behave, in, a, similar, fashion, as, crutzen, had, proposed, for, nitrous, oxide, james, lovelock, had, recently, discovered, during, a, cruise, in, the, south, atlantic, in, 1971, that, almost, all, of, the, cfc, compounds, manufactured, since, their, invention, in, 1930, were, still, present, in, the, atmosphere, molina, and, rowland, concluded, that, like, n, 2, o, the, cfcs, would, reach, the, stratosphere, where, they, would, be, dissociated, by, uv, light, releasing, chlorine, atoms, a, year, earlier, richard, stolarski, and, ralph, cicerone, at, the, university, of, michigan, had, shown, that, cl, is, even, more, efficient, than, no, at, catalyzing, the, destruction, of, ozone, similar, conclusions, were, reached, by, michael, mcelroy, and, steven, wofsy, at, harvard, university, neither, group, however, had, realized, that, cfcs, were, a, potentially, large, source, of, stratospheric, chlorine, instead, they, had, been, investigating, the, possible, effects, of, hcl, emissions, from, the, space, shuttle, which, are, very, much, smaller, the, rowland, molina, hypothesis, was, strongly, disputed, by, representatives, of, the, aerosol, and, halocarbon, industries, the, chair, of, the, board, of, dupont, was, quoted, as, saying, that, ozone, depletion, theory, is, a, science, fiction, tale, a, load, of, rubbish, utter, nonsense, robert, abplanalp, the, president, of, precision, valve, corporation, and, inventor, of, the, first, practical, aerosol, spray, can, valve, wrote, to, the, chancellor, of, uc, irvine, to, complain, about, rowland, s, public, statements, nevertheless, within, three, years, most, of, the, basic, assumptions, made, by, rowland, and, molina, were, confirmed, by, laboratory, measurements, and, by, direct, observation, in, the, stratosphere, the, concentrations, of, the, source, gases, cfcs, and, related, compounds, and, the, chlorine, reservoir, species, hcl, and, clono, 2, were, measured, throughout, the, stratosphere, and, demonstrated, that, cfcs, were, indeed, the, major, source, of, stratospheric, chlorine, and, that, nearly, all, of, the, cfcs, emitted, would, eventually, reach, the, stratosphere, even, more, convincing, was, the, measurement, by, james, g, anderson, and, collaborators, of, chlorine, monoxide, clo, in, the, stratosphere, clo, is, produced, by, the, reaction, of, cl, with, ozone, its, observation, thus, demonstrated, that, cl, radicals, not, only, were, present, in, the, stratosphere, but, also, were, actually, involved, in, destroying, ozone, mcelroy, and, wofsy, extended, the, work, of, rowland, and, molina, by, showing, that, bromine, atoms, were, even, more, effective, catalysts, for, ozone, loss, than, chlorine, atoms, and, argued, that, the, brominated, organic, compounds, known, as, halons, widely, used, in, fire, extinguishers, were, a, potentially, large, source, of, stratospheric, bromine, in, 1976, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, released, a, report, concluding, that, the, ozone, depletion, hypothesis, was, strongly, supported, by, the, scientific, evidence, in, response, the, united, states, canada, and, norway, banned, the, use, of, cfcs, in, aerosol, spray, cans, in, 1978, early, estimates, were, that, if, cfc, production, continued, at, 1977, levels, the, total, atmospheric, ozone, would, after, a, century, or, so, reach, a, steady, state, 15, to, 18, percent, below, normal, levels, by, 1984, when, better, evidence, on, the, speed, of, critical, reactions, was, available, this, estimate, was, changed, to, 5, to, 9, percent, steady, state, depletion, crutzen, molina, and, rowland, were, awarded, the, 1995, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, their, work, on, stratospheric, ozone, the, discovery, of, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, by, british, antarctic, survey, scientists, farman, gardiner, and, shanklin, first, reported, in, a, paper, in, nature, in, may, 1985, came, as, a, shock, to, the, scientific, community, because, the, observed, decline, in, polar, ozone, was, far, larger, than, had, been, anticipated, satellite, measurements, toms, onboard, nimbus, 7, showing, massive, depletion, of, ozone, around, the, south, pole, were, becoming, available, at, the, same, time, however, these, were, initially, rejected, as, unreasonable, by, data, quality, control, algorithms, they, were, filtered, out, as, errors, since, the, values, were, unexpectedly, low, the, ozone, hole, was, detected, only, in, satellite, data, when, the, raw, data, was, reprocessed, following, evidence, of, ozone, depletion, in, in, situ, observations, when, the, software, was, rerun, without, the, flags, the, ozone, hole, was, seen, as, far, back, as, 1976, susan, solomon, an, atmospheric, chemist, at, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, proposed, that, chemical, reactions, on, polar, stratospheric, clouds, pscs, in, the, cold, antarctic, stratosphere, caused, a, massive, though, localized, and, seasonal, increase, in, the, amount, of, chlorine, present, in, active, ozone, destroying, forms, the, polar, stratospheric, clouds, in, antarctica, are, only, formed, at, very, low, temperatures, as, low, as, 80, c, and, early, spring, conditions, in, such, conditions, the, ice, crystals, of, the, cloud, provide, a, suitable, surface, for, conversion, of, unreactive, chlorine, compounds, into, reactive, chlorine, compounds, which, can, easily, deplete, ozone, moreover, the, polar, vortex, formed, over, antarctica, is, very, tight, and, the, reaction, occurring, on, the, surface, of, the, cloud, crystals, is, far, different, from, when, it, occurs, in, atmosphere, these, conditions, have, led, to, ozone, hole, formation, in, antarctica, this, hypothesis, was, decisively, confirmed, first, by, laboratory, measurements, and, subsequently, by, direct, measurements, from, the, ground, and, from, high, altitude, airplanes, of, very, high, concentrations, of, chlorine, monoxide, clo, in, the, antarctic, stratosphere, alternative, hypotheses, which, had, attributed, the, ozone, hole, to, variations, in, solar, uv, radiation, or, to, changes, in, atmospheric, circulation, patterns, were, also, tested, and, shown, to, be, untenable, meanwhile, analysis, of, ozone, measurements, from, the, worldwide, network, of, ground, based, dobson, spectrophotometers, led, an, international, panel, to, conclude, that, the, ozone, layer, was, in, fact, being, depleted, at, all, latitudes, outside, of, the, tropics, these, trends, were, confirmed, by, satellite, measurements, as, a, consequence, the, major, halocarbon, producing, nations, agreed, to, phase, out, production, of, cfcs, halons, and, related, compounds, a, process, that, was, completed, in, 1996, since, 1981, the, united, nations, environment, programme, under, the, auspices, of, the, world, meteorological, organization, has, sponsored, a, series, of, technical, reports, on, the, scientific, assessment, of, ozone, depletion, based, on, satellite, measurements, the, 2007, report, showed, that, the, hole, in, the, ozone, layer, was, recovering, and, the, smallest, it, had, been, for, about, a, decade, a, 2010, report, found, over, the, past, decade, global, ozone, and, ozone, in, the, arctic, and, antarctic, regions, is, no, longer, decreasing, but, is, not, yet, increasing, the, ozone, layer, outside, the, polar, regions, is, projected, to, recover, to, its, pre, 1980, levels, some, time, before, the, middle, of, this, century, in, contrast, the, springtime, ozone, hole, over, the, antarctic, is, expected, to, recover, much, later, in, 2012, noaa, and, nasa, reported, warmer, air, temperatures, high, above, the, antarctic, led, to, the, second, smallest, season, ozone, hole, in, 20, years, averaging, 17, 9, million, square, kilometres, the, hole, reached, its, maximum, size, for, the, season, on, sept, 22, stretching, to, 21, 2, million, square, kilometres, a, gradual, trend, toward, healing, was, reported, in, 2016, and, then, in, 2017, it, is, reported, that, the, recovery, signal, is, evident, even, in, the, ozone, loss, saturation, altitudes, the, hole, in, the, earth, s, ozone, layer, over, the, south, pole, has, affected, atmospheric, circulation, in, the, southern, hemisphere, all, the, way, to, the, equator, the, ozone, hole, has, influenced, atmospheric, circulation, all, the, way, to, the, tropics, and, increased, rainfall, at, low, subtropical, latitudes, in, the, southern, hemisphere, on, march, 3, 2005, the, journal, nature, published, an, article, linking, 2004, s, unusually, large, arctic, ozone, hole, to, solar, wind, activity, on, march, 15, 2011, a, record, ozone, layer, loss, was, observed, with, about, half, of, the, ozone, present, over, the, arctic, having, been, destroyed, the, change, was, attributed, to, increasingly, cold, winters, in, the, arctic, stratosphere, at, an, altitude, of, approximately, 20, km, 12, mi, a, change, associated, with, global, warming, in, a, relationship, that, is, still, under, investigation, by, march, 25, the, ozone, loss, had, become, the, largest, compared, to, that, observed, in, all, previous, winters, with, the, possibility, that, it, would, become, an, ozone, hole, this, would, require, that, the, quantities, of, ozone, to, fall, below, 200, dobson, units, from, the, 250, recorded, over, central, siberia, it, is, predicted, that, the, thinning, layer, would, affect, parts, of, scandinavia, and, eastern, europe, on, march, 30, 31, on, october, 2, 2011, a, study, was, published, in, the, journal, nature, which, said, that, between, december, 2010, and, march, 2011, up, to, 80, percent, of, the, ozone, in, the, atmosphere, at, about, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, above, the, surface, was, destroyed, the, level, of, ozone, depletion, was, severe, enough, that, scientists, said, it, could, be, compared, to, the, ozone, hole, that, forms, over, antarctica, every, winter, according, to, the, study, for, the, first, time, sufficient, loss, occurred, to, reasonably, be, described, as, an, arctic, ozone, hole, the, study, analyzed, data, from, the, aura, and, calipso, satellites, and, determined, that, the, larger, than, normal, ozone, loss, was, due, to, an, unusually, long, period, of, cold, weather, in, the, arctic, some, 30, days, more, than, typical, which, allowed, for, more, ozone, destroying, chlorine, compounds, to, be, created, according, to, lamont, poole, a, co, author, of, the, study, cloud, and, aerosol, particles, on, which, the, chlorine, compounds, are, found, were, abundant, in, the, arctic, until, mid, march, 2011, much, later, than, usual, with, average, amounts, at, some, altitudes, similar, to, those, observed, in, the, antarctic, and, dramatically, larger, than, the, near, zero, values, seen, in, march, in, most, arctic, winters, in, 2013, researchers, analyzed, the, data, and, found, the, 2010, 2011, arctic, event, did, not, reach, the, ozone, depletion, levels, to, classify, as, a, true, hole, a, hole, in, the, ozone, is, generally, classified, as, 220, dobson, units, or, lower, the, arctic, hole, did, not, approach, that, low, level, it, has, since, been, classified, as, a, mini, hole, following, the, ozone, depletion, in, 1997, and, 2011, a, 90, drop, in, ozone, was, measured, by, weather, balloons, over, the, arctic, in, march, 2020, as, they, normally, recorded, 3, 5, parts, per, million, of, ozone, compared, to, only, around, 0, 3, parts, per, million, lastly, due, to, the, coldest, temperatures, ever, recorded, since, 1979, and, a, strong, polar, vortex, which, allowed, chemicals, including, chlorine, and, bromine, to, reduce, ozone, a, rare, hole, the, result, of, unusually, low, temperatures, in, the, atmosphere, above, the, north, pole, was, studied, in, 2020, as, winters, that, are, colder, are, more, affected, at, times, there, is, an, ozone, hole, over, tibet, in, 2006, a, 2, 5, million, square, kilometer, ozone, hole, was, detected, over, tibet, again, in, 2011, an, ozone, hole, appeared, over, mountainous, regions, of, tibet, xinjiang, qinghai, and, the, hindu, kush, along, with, an, unprecedented, hole, over, the, arctic, though, the, tibet, one, was, far, less, intense, than, the, ones, over, the, arctic, or, antarctic, research, in, 2012, showed, that, the, same, process, that, produces, the, ozone, hole, over, antarctica, occurs, over, summer, storm, clouds, in, the, united, states, and, thus, may, be, destroying, ozone, there, as, well, physicist, qing, bin, lu, of, the, university, of, waterloo, claimed, to, have, discovered, a, large, all, season, ozone, hole, in, the, lower, stratosphere, over, the, tropics, in, july, 2022, however, other, researchers, in, the, field, refuted, this, claim, stating, that, the, research, was, riddled, with, serious, errors, and, unsubstantiated, assertions, according, to, dr, paul, young, a, lead, author, of, the, 2022, wmo, unep, scientific, assessment, of, ozone, depletion, the, author, s, identification, of, a, tropical, ozone, hole, is, down, to, him, looking, at, percentage, changes, in, ozone, rather, than, absolute, changes, with, the, latter, being, much, more, relevant, for, damaging, uv, reaching, the, surface, specifically, lu, s, work, defines, ozone, hole, as, an, area, with, o3, loss, in, percent, larger, than, 25, with, respect, to, the, undisturbed, o3, value, when, there, were, no, significant, cfcs, in, the, stratosphere, in, the, 1960s, instead, of, the, general, definition, of, 220, dobson, units, or, lower, dr, marta, abalos, alvarez, has, added, ozone, depletion, in, the, tropics, is, nothing, new, and, is, mainly, due, to, the, acceleration, of, the, brewer, dobson, circulation, analyzing, the, atmospheric, impacts, of, the, 2019, 2020, australian, bushfire, season, scientists, led, by, mit, researcher, susan, solomon, found, the, smoke, destroyed, 3, 5, of, ozone, in, affected, areas, of, the, southern, hemisphere, smoke, particles, absorb, hydrogen, chloride, and, act, as, a, catalyst, to, create, chlorine, radicals, that, destroy, ozone, among, others, robert, watson, had, a, role, in, the, science, assessment, and, in, the, regulation, efforts, of, ozone, depletion, and, global, warming, prior, to, the, 1980s, the, eu, nasa, nas, unep, wmo, and, the, british, government, had, dissenting, scientific, reports, and, watson, played, a, role, in, the, process, of, unified, assessments, based, on, the, experience, with, the, ozone, case, the, ipcc, started, to, work, on, a, unified, reporting, and, science, assessment, to, reach, a, consensus, to, provide, the, ipcc, summary, for, policymakers, there, are, various, areas, of, linkage, between, ozone, depletion, and, global, warming, science, in, 2019, nasa, reported, that, there, was, no, significant, relation, between, size, of, the, ozone, hole, and, climate, change, since, cfc, molecules, are, heavier, than, air, nitrogen, or, oxygen, it, is, commonly, believed, that, the, cfc, molecules, cannot, reach, the, stratosphere, in, significant, amounts, however, atmospheric, gases, are, not, sorted, by, weight, at, these, altitudes, the, forces, of, wind, can, fully, mix, the, gases, in, the, atmosphere, some, of, the, heavier, cfcs, are, not, evenly, distributed, another, misconception, is, that, it, is, generally, accepted, that, natural, sources, of, tropospheric, chlorine, are, four, to, five, times, larger, than, man, made, ones, while, this, statement, is, strictly, true, tropospheric, chlorine, is, irrelevant, it, is, stratospheric, chlorine, that, affects, ozone, depletion, chlorine, from, ocean, spray, is, soluble, and, thus, is, washed, by, rainfall, before, it, reaches, the, stratosphere, cfcs, in, contrast, are, insoluble, and, long, lived, allowing, them, to, reach, the, stratosphere, in, the, lower, atmosphere, there, is, much, more, chlorine, from, cfcs, and, related, haloalkanes, than, there, is, in, hcl, from, salt, spray, and, in, the, stratosphere, halocarbons, are, dominant, only, methyl, chloride, which, is, one, of, these, halocarbons, has, a, mainly, natural, source, and, it, is, responsible, for, about, 20, percent, of, the, chlorine, in, the, stratosphere, the, remaining, 80, percent, comes, from, manmade, sources, very, violent, volcanic, eruptions, can, inject, hcl, into, the, stratosphere, but, researchers, have, shown, that, the, contribution, is, not, significant, compared, to, that, from, cfcs, a, similar, erroneous, assertion, is, that, soluble, halogen, compounds, from, the, volcanic, plume, of, mount, erebus, on, ross, island, antarctica, are, a, major, contributor, to, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, nevertheless, a, 2015, study, showed, that, the, role, of, mount, erebus, volcano, in, the, antarctic, ozone, depletion, was, probably, underestimated, based, on, the, ncep, ncar, reanalysis, data, over, the, last, 35, years, and, by, using, the, noaa, hysplit, trajectory, model, researchers, showed, that, erebus, volcano, gas, emissions, including, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, can, reach, the, antarctic, stratosphere, via, high, latitude, cyclones, and, then, the, polar, vortex, depending, on, erebus, volcano, activity, the, additional, annual, hcl, mass, entering, the, stratosphere, from, erebus, varies, from, 1, 0, to, 14, 3, kt, g, m, b, dobson, mentioned, that, when, springtime, ozone, levels, in, the, antarctic, over, halley, bay, were, first, measured, in, 1956, he, was, surprised, to, find, that, they, were, 320, du, or, about, 150, du, below, spring, arctic, levels, of, 450, du, these, were, at, that, time, the, only, known, antarctic, ozone, values, available, what, dobson, describes, is, essentially, the, baseline, from, which, the, ozone, hole, is, measured, actual, ozone, hole, values, are, in, the, 150, 100, du, range, the, discrepancy, between, the, arctic, and, antarctic, noted, by, dobson, was, primarily, a, matter, of, timing, during, the, arctic, spring, ozone, levels, rose, smoothly, peaking, in, april, whereas, in, the, antarctic, they, stayed, approximately, constant, during, early, spring, rising, abruptly, in, november, when, the, polar, vortex, broke, down, the, behavior, seen, in, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, is, different, instead, of, staying, constant, early, springtime, ozone, levels, drop, from, their, already, low, winter, values, by, as, much, as, 50, percent, and, normal, values, are, not, reached, again, until, december, some, people, thought, that, the, ozone, hole, should, be, above, the, sources, of, cfcs, however, cfcs, are, well, mixed, globally, in, the, troposphere, and, stratosphere, the, reason, for, occurrence, of, the, ozone, hole, above, antarctica, is, not, because, there, are, more, cfcs, concentrated, but, because, the, low, temperatures, help, form, polar, stratospheric, clouds, in, fact, there, are, findings, of, significant, and, localized, ozone, holes, above, other, parts, of, the, earth, such, as, above, central, asia, public, misconceptions, and, misunderstandings, of, complex, issues, like, ozone, depletion, are, common, the, limited, scientific, knowledge, of, the, public, led, to, confusion, about, global, warming, or, the, perception, of, global, warming, as, a, subset, of, the, ozone, hole, in, the, beginning, classical, green, ngos, refrained, from, using, cfc, depletion, for, campaigning, as, they, assumed, the, topic, was, too, complicated, they, became, active, much, later, e, g, in, greenpeace, s, support, for, a, cfc, free, refrigerator, produced, by, the, former, east, german, company, veb, dkk, scharfenstein, the, metaphors, used, in, the, cfc, discussion, ozone, shield, ozone, hole, are, not, exact, in, the, scientific, sense, the, ozone, hole, is, more, of, a, depression, less, a, hole, in, the, windshield, the, ozone, does, not, disappear, through, the, layer, nor, is, there, a, uniform, thinning, of, the, ozone, layer, however, they, resonated, better, with, non, scientists, and, their, concerns, the, ozone, hole, was, seen, as, a, hot, issue, and, imminent, risk, as, laypeople, feared, severe, personal, consequences, such, as, skin, cancer, cataracts, damage, to, plants, and, reduction, of, plankton, populations, in, the, ocean, s, photic, zone, not, only, on, the, policy, level, ozone, regulation, compared, to, climate, change, fared, much, better, in, public, opinion, americans, voluntarily, switched, away, from, aerosol, sprays, before, legislation, was, enforced, while, climate, change, failed, to, achieve, comparable, concern, and, public, action, the, sudden, identification, in, 1985, that, there, was, a, substantial, hole, was, widely, reported, in, the, press, the, especially, rapid, ozone, depletion, in, antarctica, had, previously, been, dismissed, as, a, measurement, error, scientific, consensus, was, established, after, regulation, while, the, antarctic, ozone, hole, has, a, relatively, small, effect, on, global, ozone, the, hole, has, generated, a, great, deal, of, public, interest, because, in, 1994, the, united, nations, general, assembly, voted, to, designate, september, 16, as, the, international, day, for, the, preservation, of, the, ozone, layer, or, world, ozone, day, the, designation, commemorates, the, signing, of, the, montreal, protocol, on, that, date, in, 1987
