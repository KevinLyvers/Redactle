water, vapor, water, vapour, or, aqueous, vapor, is, the, gaseous, phase, of, water, it, is, one, state, of, water, within, the, hydrosphere, water, vapor, can, be, produced, from, the, evaporation, or, boiling, of, liquid, water, or, from, the, sublimation, of, ice, water, vapor, is, transparent, like, most, constituents, of, the, atmosphere, under, typical, atmospheric, conditions, water, vapor, is, continuously, generated, by, evaporation, and, removed, by, condensation, it, is, less, dense, than, most, of, the, other, constituents, of, air, and, triggers, convection, currents, that, can, lead, to, clouds, and, fog, being, a, component, of, earth, s, hydrosphere, and, hydrologic, cycle, it, is, particularly, abundant, in, earth, s, atmosphere, where, it, acts, as, a, greenhouse, gas, and, warming, feedback, contributing, more, to, total, greenhouse, effect, than, non, condensable, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, use, of, water, vapor, as, steam, has, been, important, for, cooking, and, as, a, major, component, in, energy, production, and, transport, systems, since, the, industrial, revolution, water, vapor, is, a, relatively, common, atmospheric, constituent, present, even, in, the, solar, atmosphere, as, well, as, every, planet, in, the, solar, system, and, many, astronomical, objects, including, natural, satellites, comets, and, even, large, asteroids, likewise, the, detection, of, extrasolar, water, vapor, would, indicate, a, similar, distribution, in, other, planetary, systems, water, vapor, can, also, be, indirect, evidence, supporting, the, presence, of, extraterrestrial, liquid, water, in, the, case, of, some, planetary, mass, objects, water, vapor, which, reacts, to, temperature, changes, is, referred, to, as, a, feedback, because, it, amplifies, the, effect, of, forces, that, initially, cause, the, warming, so, it, is, a, greenhouse, gas, whenever, a, water, molecule, leaves, a, surface, and, diffuses, into, a, surrounding, gas, it, is, said, to, have, evaporated, each, individual, water, molecule, which, transitions, between, a, more, associated, liquid, and, a, less, associated, vapor, gas, state, does, so, through, the, absorption, or, release, of, kinetic, energy, the, aggregate, measurement, of, this, kinetic, energy, transfer, is, defined, as, thermal, energy, and, occurs, only, when, there, is, differential, in, the, temperature, of, the, water, molecules, liquid, water, that, becomes, water, vapor, takes, a, parcel, of, heat, with, it, in, a, process, called, evaporative, cooling, the, amount, of, water, vapor, in, the, air, determines, how, frequently, molecules, will, return, to, the, surface, when, a, net, evaporation, occurs, the, body, of, water, will, undergo, a, net, cooling, directly, related, to, the, loss, of, water, in, the, us, the, national, weather, service, measures, the, actual, rate, of, evaporation, from, a, standardized, pan, open, water, surface, outdoors, at, various, locations, nationwide, others, do, likewise, around, the, world, the, us, data, is, collected, and, compiled, into, an, annual, evaporation, map, the, measurements, range, from, under, 30, to, over, 120, inches, per, year, formulas, can, be, used, for, calculating, the, rate, of, evaporation, from, a, water, surface, such, as, a, swimming, pool, in, some, countries, the, evaporation, rate, far, exceeds, the, precipitation, rate, evaporative, cooling, is, restricted, by, atmospheric, conditions, humidity, is, the, amount, of, water, vapor, in, the, air, the, vapor, content, of, air, is, measured, with, devices, known, as, hygrometers, the, measurements, are, usually, expressed, as, specific, humidity, or, percent, relative, humidity, the, temperatures, of, the, atmosphere, and, the, water, surface, determine, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, 100, relative, humidity, occurs, when, the, partial, pressure, of, water, vapor, is, equal, to, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, this, condition, is, often, referred, to, as, complete, saturation, humidity, ranges, from, 0, grams, per, cubic, metre, in, dry, air, to, 30, grams, per, cubic, metre, 0, 03, ounce, per, cubic, foot, when, the, vapor, is, saturated, at, 30, c, sublimation, is, the, process, by, which, water, molecules, directly, leave, the, surface, of, ice, without, first, becoming, liquid, water, sublimation, accounts, for, the, slow, mid, winter, disappearance, of, ice, and, snow, at, temperatures, too, low, to, cause, melting, antarctica, shows, this, effect, to, a, unique, degree, because, it, is, by, far, the, continent, with, the, lowest, rate, of, precipitation, on, earth, as, a, result, there, are, large, areas, where, millennial, layers, of, snow, have, sublimed, leaving, behind, whatever, non, volatile, materials, they, had, contained, this, is, extremely, valuable, to, certain, scientific, disciplines, a, dramatic, example, being, the, collection, of, meteorites, that, are, left, exposed, in, unparalleled, numbers, and, excellent, states, of, preservation, sublimation, is, important, in, the, preparation, of, certain, classes, of, biological, specimens, for, scanning, electron, microscopy, typically, the, specimens, are, prepared, by, cryofixation, and, freeze, fracture, after, which, the, broken, surface, is, freeze, etched, being, eroded, by, exposure, to, vacuum, until, it, shows, the, required, level, of, detail, this, technique, can, display, protein, molecules, organelle, structures, and, lipid, bilayers, with, very, low, degrees, of, distortion, water, vapor, will, only, condense, onto, another, surface, when, that, surface, is, cooler, than, the, dew, point, temperature, or, when, the, water, vapor, equilibrium, in, air, has, been, exceeded, when, water, vapor, condenses, onto, a, surface, a, net, warming, occurs, on, that, surface, the, water, molecule, brings, heat, energy, with, it, in, turn, the, temperature, of, the, atmosphere, drops, slightly, in, the, atmosphere, condensation, produces, clouds, fog, and, precipitation, usually, only, when, facilitated, by, cloud, condensation, nuclei, the, dew, point, of, an, air, parcel, is, the, temperature, to, which, it, must, cool, before, water, vapor, in, the, air, begins, to, condense, condensation, in, the, atmosphere, forms, cloud, droplets, also, a, net, condensation, of, water, vapor, occurs, on, surfaces, when, the, temperature, of, the, surface, is, at, or, below, the, dew, point, temperature, of, the, atmosphere, deposition, is, a, phase, transition, separate, from, condensation, which, leads, to, the, direct, formation, of, ice, from, water, vapor, frost, and, snow, are, examples, of, deposition, there, are, several, mechanisms, of, cooling, by, which, condensation, occurs, 1, direct, loss, of, heat, by, conduction, or, radiation, 2, cooling, from, the, drop, in, air, pressure, which, occurs, with, uplift, of, air, also, known, as, adiabatic, cooling, air, can, be, lifted, by, mountains, which, deflect, the, air, upward, by, convection, and, by, cold, and, warm, fronts, 3, advective, cooling, cooling, due, to, horizontal, movement, of, air, a, number, of, chemical, reactions, have, water, as, a, product, if, the, reactions, take, place, at, temperatures, higher, than, the, dew, point, of, the, surrounding, air, the, water, will, be, formed, as, vapor, and, increase, the, local, humidity, if, below, the, dew, point, local, condensation, will, occur, typical, reactions, that, result, in, water, formation, are, the, burning, of, hydrogen, or, hydrocarbons, in, air, or, other, oxygen, containing, gas, mixtures, or, as, a, result, of, reactions, with, oxidizers, in, a, similar, fashion, other, chemical, or, physical, reactions, can, take, place, in, the, presence, of, water, vapor, resulting, in, new, chemicals, forming, such, as, rust, on, iron, or, steel, polymerization, occurring, certain, polyurethane, foams, and, cyanoacrylate, glues, cure, with, exposure, to, atmospheric, humidity, or, forms, changing, such, as, where, anhydrous, chemicals, may, absorb, enough, vapor, to, form, a, crystalline, structure, or, alter, an, existing, one, sometimes, resulting, in, characteristic, color, changes, that, can, be, used, for, measurement, measuring, the, quantity, of, water, vapor, in, a, medium, can, be, done, directly, or, remotely, with, varying, degrees, of, accuracy, remote, methods, such, electromagnetic, absorption, are, possible, from, satellites, above, planetary, atmospheres, direct, methods, may, use, electronic, transducers, moistened, thermometers, or, hygroscopic, materials, measuring, changes, in, physical, properties, or, dimensions, water, vapor, is, lighter, or, less, dense, than, dry, air, at, equivalent, temperatures, it, is, buoyant, with, respect, to, dry, air, whereby, the, density, of, dry, air, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, 273, 15, k, 101, 325, kpa, is, 1, 27, g, l, and, water, vapor, at, standard, temperature, has, a, vapor, pressure, of, 0, 6, kpa, and, the, much, lower, density, of, 0, 0048, g, l, water, vapor, and, dry, air, density, calculations, at, 0, c, at, the, same, temperature, a, column, of, dry, air, will, be, denser, or, heavier, than, a, column, of, air, containing, any, water, vapor, the, molar, mass, of, diatomic, nitrogen, and, diatomic, oxygen, both, being, greater, than, the, molar, mass, of, water, thus, any, volume, of, dry, air, will, sink, if, placed, in, a, larger, volume, of, moist, air, also, a, volume, of, moist, air, will, rise, or, be, buoyant, if, placed, in, a, larger, region, of, dry, air, as, the, temperature, rises, the, proportion, of, water, vapor, in, the, air, increases, and, its, buoyancy, will, increase, the, increase, in, buoyancy, can, have, a, significant, atmospheric, impact, giving, rise, to, powerful, moisture, rich, upward, air, currents, when, the, air, temperature, and, sea, temperature, reaches, 25, c, or, above, this, phenomenon, provides, a, significant, driving, force, for, cyclonic, and, anticyclonic, weather, systems, typhoons, and, hurricanes, water, vapor, is, a, by, product, of, respiration, in, plants, and, animals, its, contribution, to, the, pressure, increases, as, its, concentration, increases, its, partial, pressure, contribution, to, air, pressure, increases, lowering, the, partial, pressure, contribution, of, the, other, atmospheric, gases, dalton, s, law, the, total, air, pressure, must, remain, constant, the, presence, of, water, vapor, in, the, air, naturally, dilutes, or, displaces, the, other, air, components, as, its, concentration, increases, this, can, have, an, effect, on, respiration, in, very, warm, air, 35, c, the, proportion, of, water, vapor, is, large, enough, to, give, rise, to, the, stuffiness, that, can, be, experienced, in, humid, jungle, conditions, or, in, poorly, ventilated, buildings, water, vapor, has, lower, density, than, that, of, air, and, is, therefore, buoyant, in, air, but, has, lower, vapor, pressure, than, that, of, air, when, water, vapor, is, used, as, a, lifting, gas, by, a, thermal, airship, the, water, vapor, is, heated, to, form, steam, so, that, its, vapor, pressure, is, greater, than, the, surrounding, air, pressure, in, order, to, maintain, the, shape, of, a, theoretical, steam, balloon, which, yields, approximately, 60, the, lift, of, helium, and, twice, that, of, hot, air, the, amount, of, water, vapor, in, an, atmosphere, is, constrained, by, the, restrictions, of, partial, pressures, and, temperature, dew, point, temperature, and, relative, humidity, act, as, guidelines, for, the, process, of, water, vapor, in, the, water, cycle, energy, input, such, as, sunlight, can, trigger, more, evaporation, on, an, ocean, surface, or, more, sublimation, on, a, chunk, of, ice, on, top, of, a, mountain, the, balance, between, condensation, and, evaporation, gives, the, quantity, called, vapor, partial, pressure, the, maximum, partial, pressure, saturation, pressure, of, water, vapor, in, air, varies, with, temperature, of, the, air, and, water, vapor, mixture, a, variety, of, empirical, formulas, exist, for, this, quantity, the, most, used, reference, formula, is, the, goff, gratch, equation, for, the, svp, over, liquid, water, below, zero, degrees, celsius, where, t, temperature, of, the, moist, air, is, given, in, units, of, kelvin, and, p, is, given, in, units, of, millibars, hectopascals, the, formula, is, valid, from, about, 50, to, 102, c, however, there, are, a, very, limited, number, of, measurements, of, the, vapor, pressure, of, water, over, supercooled, liquid, water, there, are, a, number, of, other, formulae, which, can, be, used, under, certain, conditions, such, as, when, the, boiling, temperature, of, water, is, reached, a, net, evaporation, will, always, occur, during, standard, atmospheric, conditions, regardless, of, the, percent, of, relative, humidity, this, immediate, process, will, dispel, massive, amounts, of, water, vapor, into, a, cooler, atmosphere, exhaled, air, is, almost, fully, at, equilibrium, with, water, vapor, at, the, body, temperature, in, the, cold, air, the, exhaled, vapor, quickly, condenses, thus, showing, up, as, a, fog, or, mist, of, water, droplets, and, as, condensation, or, frost, on, surfaces, forcibly, condensing, these, water, droplets, from, exhaled, breath, is, the, basis, of, exhaled, breath, condensate, an, evolving, medical, diagnostic, test, controlling, water, vapor, in, air, is, a, key, concern, in, the, heating, ventilating, and, air, conditioning, hvac, industry, thermal, comfort, depends, on, the, moist, air, conditions, non, human, comfort, situations, are, called, refrigeration, and, also, are, affected, by, water, vapor, for, example, many, food, stores, like, supermarkets, utilize, open, chiller, cabinets, or, food, cases, which, can, significantly, lower, the, water, vapor, pressure, lowering, humidity, this, practice, delivers, several, benefits, as, well, as, problems, gaseous, water, represents, a, small, but, environmentally, significant, constituent, of, the, atmosphere, the, percentage, of, water, vapor, in, surface, air, varies, from, 0, 01, at, 42, c, 44, f, to, 4, 24, when, the, dew, point, is, 30, c, 86, f, over, 99, of, atmospheric, water, is, in, the, form, of, vapour, rather, than, liquid, water, or, ice, and, approximately, 99, 13, of, the, water, vapour, is, contained, in, the, troposphere, the, condensation, of, water, vapor, to, the, liquid, or, ice, phase, is, responsible, for, clouds, rain, snow, and, other, precipitation, all, of, which, count, among, the, most, significant, elements, of, what, we, experience, as, weather, less, obviously, the, latent, heat, of, vaporization, which, is, released, to, the, atmosphere, whenever, condensation, occurs, is, one, of, the, most, important, terms, in, the, atmospheric, energy, budget, on, both, local, and, global, scales, for, example, latent, heat, release, in, atmospheric, convection, is, directly, responsible, for, powering, destructive, storms, such, as, tropical, cyclones, and, severe, thunderstorms, water, vapor, is, an, important, greenhouse, gas, owing, to, the, presence, of, the, hydroxyl, bond, which, strongly, absorbs, in, the, infra, red, water, vapor, is, the, working, medium, of, the, atmospheric, thermodynamic, engine, which, transforms, heat, energy, from, sun, irradiation, into, mechanical, energy, in, the, form, of, winds, transforming, thermal, energy, into, mechanical, energy, requires, an, upper, and, a, lower, temperature, level, as, well, as, a, working, medium, which, shuttles, forth, and, back, between, both, the, upper, temperature, level, is, given, by, the, soil, or, water, surface, of, the, earth, which, absorbs, the, incoming, sun, radiation, and, warms, up, evaporating, water, the, moist, and, warm, air, at, the, ground, is, lighter, than, its, surroundings, and, rises, up, to, the, upper, limit, of, the, troposphere, there, the, water, molecules, radiate, their, thermal, energy, into, outer, space, cooling, down, the, surrounding, air, the, upper, atmosphere, constitutes, the, lower, temperature, level, of, the, atmospheric, thermodynamic, engine, the, water, vapor, in, the, now, cold, air, condenses, out, and, falls, down, to, the, ground, in, the, form, of, rain, or, snow, the, now, heavier, cold, and, dry, air, sinks, down, to, ground, as, well, the, atmospheric, thermodynamic, engine, thus, establishes, a, vertical, convection, which, transports, heat, from, the, ground, into, the, upper, atmosphere, where, the, water, molecules, can, radiate, it, to, outer, space, due, to, the, earth, s, rotation, and, the, resulting, coriolis, forces, this, vertical, atmospheric, convection, is, also, converted, into, a, horizontal, convection, in, the, form, of, cyclones, and, anticyclones, which, transport, the, water, evaporated, over, the, oceans, into, the, interior, of, the, continents, enabling, vegetation, to, grow, water, in, earth, s, atmosphere, is, not, merely, below, its, boiling, point, 100, c, but, at, altitude, it, goes, below, its, freezing, point, 0, c, due, to, water, s, highly, polar, attraction, when, combined, with, its, quantity, water, vapor, then, has, a, relevant, dew, point, and, frost, point, unlike, e, g, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, water, vapor, thus, has, a, scale, height, a, fraction, of, that, of, the, bulk, atmosphere, as, the, water, condenses, and, exits, primarily, in, the, troposphere, the, lowest, layer, of, the, atmosphere, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, methane, being, well, mixed, in, the, atmosphere, tend, to, rise, above, water, vapour, the, absorption, and, emission, of, both, compounds, contribute, to, earth, s, emission, to, space, and, thus, the, planetary, greenhouse, effect, this, greenhouse, forcing, is, directly, observable, via, distinct, spectral, features, versus, water, vapor, and, observed, to, be, rising, with, rising, co, 2, levels, conversely, adding, water, vapor, at, high, altitudes, has, a, disproportionate, impact, which, is, why, jet, traffic, has, a, disproportionately, high, warming, effect, oxidation, of, methane, is, also, a, major, source, of, water, vapour, in, the, stratosphere, and, adds, about, 15, to, methane, s, global, warming, effect, in, the, absence, of, other, greenhouse, gases, earth, s, water, vapor, would, condense, to, the, surface, this, has, likely, happened, possibly, more, than, once, scientists, thus, distinguish, between, non, condensable, driving, and, condensable, driven, greenhouse, gases, i, e, the, above, water, vapor, feedback, fog, and, clouds, form, through, condensation, around, cloud, condensation, nuclei, in, the, absence, of, nuclei, condensation, will, only, occur, at, much, lower, temperatures, under, persistent, condensation, or, deposition, cloud, droplets, or, snowflakes, form, which, precipitate, when, they, reach, a, critical, mass, atmospheric, concentration, of, water, vapour, is, highly, variable, between, locations, and, times, from, 10, ppmv, in, the, coldest, air, to, 5, 50, 000, ppmv, in, humid, tropical, air, and, can, be, measured, with, a, combination, of, land, observations, weather, balloons, and, satellites, the, water, content, of, the, atmosphere, as, a, whole, is, constantly, depleted, by, precipitation, at, the, same, time, it, is, constantly, replenished, by, evaporation, most, prominently, from, oceans, lakes, rivers, and, moist, earth, other, sources, of, atmospheric, water, include, combustion, respiration, volcanic, eruptions, the, transpiration, of, plants, and, various, other, biological, and, geological, processes, at, any, given, time, there, is, about, 1, 29, x, 10, 16, litres, 3, 4, x, 10, 15, gal, of, water, in, the, atmosphere, the, atmosphere, holds, 1, part, in, 2500, of, the, fresh, water, and, 1, part, in, 100, 000, of, the, total, water, on, earth, the, mean, global, content, of, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, is, roughly, sufficient, to, cover, the, surface, of, the, planet, with, a, layer, of, liquid, water, about, 25, mm, deep, the, mean, annual, precipitation, for, the, planet, is, about, 1, metre, a, comparison, which, implies, a, rapid, turnover, of, water, in, the, air, on, average, the, residence, time, of, a, water, molecule, in, the, troposphere, is, about, 9, to, 10, days, global, mean, water, vapour, is, about, 0, 25, of, the, atmosphere, by, mass, and, also, varies, seasonally, in, terms, of, contribution, to, atmospheric, pressure, between, 2, 62, hpa, in, july, and, 2, 33, hpa, in, december, ipcc, ar6, expresses, medium, confidence, in, increase, of, total, water, vapour, at, about, 1, 2, per, decade, it, is, expected, to, increase, by, around, 7, per, c, of, warming, episodes, of, surface, geothermal, activity, such, as, volcanic, eruptions, and, geysers, release, variable, amounts, of, water, vapor, into, the, atmosphere, such, eruptions, may, be, large, in, human, terms, and, major, explosive, eruptions, may, inject, exceptionally, large, masses, of, water, exceptionally, high, into, the, atmosphere, but, as, a, percentage, of, total, atmospheric, water, the, role, of, such, processes, is, trivial, the, relative, concentrations, of, the, various, gases, emitted, by, volcanoes, varies, considerably, according, to, the, site, and, according, to, the, particular, event, at, any, one, site, however, water, vapor, is, consistently, the, commonest, volcanic, gas, as, a, rule, it, comprises, more, than, 60, of, total, emissions, during, a, subaerial, eruption, atmospheric, water, vapor, content, is, expressed, using, various, measures, these, include, vapor, pressure, specific, humidity, mixing, ratio, dew, point, temperature, and, relative, humidity, because, water, molecules, absorb, microwaves, and, other, radio, wave, frequencies, water, in, the, atmosphere, attenuates, radar, signals, in, addition, atmospheric, water, will, reflect, and, refract, signals, to, an, extent, that, depends, on, whether, it, is, vapor, liquid, or, solid, generally, radar, signals, lose, strength, progressively, the, farther, they, travel, through, the, troposphere, different, frequencies, attenuate, at, different, rates, such, that, some, components, of, air, are, opaque, to, some, frequencies, and, transparent, to, others, radio, waves, used, for, broadcasting, and, other, communication, experience, the, same, effect, water, vapor, reflects, radar, to, a, lesser, extent, than, do, water, s, other, two, phases, in, the, form, of, drops, and, ice, crystals, water, acts, as, a, prism, which, it, does, not, do, as, an, individual, molecule, however, the, existence, of, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, causes, the, atmosphere, to, act, as, a, giant, prism, a, comparison, of, goes, 12, satellite, images, shows, the, distribution, of, atmospheric, water, vapor, relative, to, the, oceans, clouds, and, continents, of, the, earth, vapor, surrounds, the, planet, but, is, unevenly, distributed, the, image, loop, on, the, right, shows, monthly, average, of, water, vapor, content, with, the, units, are, given, in, centimeters, which, is, the, precipitable, water, or, equivalent, amount, of, water, that, could, be, produced, if, all, the, water, vapor, in, the, column, were, to, condense, the, lowest, amounts, of, water, vapor, 0, centimeters, appear, in, yellow, and, the, highest, amounts, 6, centimeters, appear, in, dark, blue, areas, of, missing, data, appear, in, shades, of, gray, the, maps, are, based, on, data, collected, by, the, moderate, resolution, imaging, spectroradiometer, modis, sensor, on, nasa, s, aqua, satellite, the, most, noticeable, pattern, in, the, time, series, is, the, influence, of, seasonal, temperature, changes, and, incoming, sunlight, on, water, vapor, in, the, tropics, a, band, of, extremely, humid, air, wobbles, north, and, south, of, the, equator, as, the, seasons, change, this, band, of, humidity, is, part, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, where, the, easterly, trade, winds, from, each, hemisphere, converge, and, produce, near, daily, thunderstorms, and, clouds, farther, from, the, equator, water, vapor, concentrations, are, high, in, the, hemisphere, experiencing, summer, and, low, in, the, one, experiencing, winter, another, pattern, that, shows, up, in, the, time, series, is, that, water, vapor, amounts, over, land, areas, decrease, more, in, winter, months, than, adjacent, ocean, areas, do, this, is, largely, because, air, temperatures, over, land, drop, more, in, the, winter, than, temperatures, over, the, ocean, water, vapor, condenses, more, rapidly, in, colder, air, as, water, vapor, absorbs, light, in, the, visible, spectral, range, its, absorption, can, be, used, in, spectroscopic, applications, such, as, doas, to, determine, the, amount, of, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, this, is, done, operationally, e, g, from, the, global, ozone, monitoring, experiment, gome, spectrometers, on, ers, gome, and, metop, gome, 2, the, weaker, water, vapor, absorption, lines, in, the, blue, spectral, range, and, further, into, the, uv, up, to, its, dissociation, limit, around, 243, nm, are, mostly, based, on, quantum, mechanical, calculations, and, are, only, partly, confirmed, by, experiments, water, vapor, plays, a, key, role, in, lightning, production, in, the, atmosphere, from, cloud, physics, usually, clouds, are, the, real, generators, of, static, charge, as, found, in, earth, s, atmosphere, the, ability, of, clouds, to, hold, massive, amounts, of, electrical, energy, is, directly, related, to, the, amount, of, water, vapor, present, in, the, local, system, the, amount, of, water, vapor, directly, controls, the, permittivity, of, the, air, during, times, of, low, humidity, static, discharge, is, quick, and, easy, during, times, of, higher, humidity, fewer, static, discharges, occur, permittivity, and, capacitance, work, hand, in, hand, to, produce, the, megawatt, outputs, of, lightning, after, a, cloud, for, instance, has, started, its, way, to, becoming, a, lightning, generator, atmospheric, water, vapor, acts, as, a, substance, or, insulator, that, decreases, the, ability, of, the, cloud, to, discharge, its, electrical, energy, over, a, certain, amount, of, time, if, the, cloud, continues, to, generate, and, store, more, static, electricity, the, barrier, that, was, created, by, the, atmospheric, water, vapor, will, ultimately, break, down, from, the, stored, electrical, potential, energy, this, energy, will, be, released, to, a, local, oppositely, charged, region, in, the, form, of, lightning, the, strength, of, each, discharge, is, directly, related, to, the, atmospheric, permittivity, capacitance, and, the, source, s, charge, generating, ability, water, vapor, is, common, in, the, solar, system, and, by, extension, other, planetary, systems, its, signature, has, been, detected, in, the, atmospheres, of, the, sun, occurring, in, sunspots, the, presence, of, water, vapor, has, been, detected, in, the, atmospheres, of, all, seven, extraterrestrial, planets, in, the, solar, system, the, earth, s, moon, and, the, moons, of, other, planets, although, typically, in, only, trace, amounts, geological, formations, such, as, cryogeysers, are, thought, to, exist, on, the, surface, of, several, icy, moons, ejecting, water, vapor, due, to, tidal, heating, and, may, indicate, the, presence, of, substantial, quantities, of, subsurface, water, plumes, of, water, vapor, have, been, detected, on, jupiter, s, moon, europa, and, are, similar, to, plumes, of, water, vapor, detected, on, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, traces, of, water, vapor, have, also, been, detected, in, the, stratosphere, of, titan, water, vapor, has, been, found, to, be, a, major, constituent, of, the, atmosphere, of, dwarf, planet, ceres, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, the, detection, was, made, by, using, the, far, infrared, abilities, of, the, herschel, space, observatory, the, finding, is, unexpected, because, comets, not, asteroids, are, typically, considered, to, sprout, jets, and, plumes, according, to, one, of, the, scientists, the, lines, are, becoming, more, and, more, blurred, between, comets, and, asteroids, scientists, studying, mars, hypothesize, that, if, water, moves, about, the, planet, it, does, so, as, vapor, the, brilliance, of, comet, tails, comes, largely, from, water, vapor, on, approach, to, the, sun, the, ice, many, comets, carry, sublimes, to, vapor, knowing, a, comet, s, distance, from, the, sun, astronomers, may, deduce, the, comet, s, water, content, from, its, brilliance, water, vapor, has, also, been, confirmed, outside, the, solar, system, spectroscopic, analysis, of, hd, 209458, b, an, extrasolar, planet, in, the, constellation, pegasus, provides, the, first, evidence, of, atmospheric, water, vapor, beyond, the, solar, system, a, star, called, cw, leonis, was, found, to, have, a, ring, of, vast, quantities, of, water, vapor, circling, the, aging, massive, star, a, nasa, satellite, designed, to, study, chemicals, in, interstellar, gas, clouds, made, the, discovery, with, an, onboard, spectrometer, most, likely, the, water, vapor, was, vaporized, from, the, surfaces, of, orbiting, comets, other, exoplanets, with, evidence, of, water, vapor, include, hat, p, 11b, and, k2, 18b
