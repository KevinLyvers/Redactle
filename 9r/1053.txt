in, particle, physics, a, boson, b, o, z, n, b, o, s, n, is, a, subatomic, particle, whose, spin, quantum, number, has, an, integer, value, 0, 1, 2, bosons, form, one, of, the, two, fundamental, classes, of, subatomic, particle, the, other, being, fermions, which, have, odd, half, integer, spin, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, every, observed, subatomic, particle, is, either, a, boson, or, a, fermion, paul, dirac, coined, the, name, boson, to, commemorate, the, contribution, of, satyendra, nath, bose, an, indian, physicist, some, bosons, are, elementary, particles, occupying, a, special, role, in, particle, physics, distinct, from, the, role, of, fermions, which, are, sometimes, described, as, the, constituents, of, ordinary, matter, certain, elementary, bosons, e, g, gluons, act, as, force, carriers, which, give, rise, to, forces, between, other, particles, while, one, the, higgs, boson, contributes, to, the, phenomenon, of, mass, other, bosons, such, as, mesons, are, composite, particles, made, up, of, smaller, constituents, outside, the, realm, of, particle, physics, multiple, identical, composite, bosons, in, this, context, sometimes, known, as, bose, particles, behave, at, high, densities, or, low, temperatures, in, a, characteristic, manner, described, by, bose, einstein, statistics, for, example, a, gas, of, helium, 4, atoms, becomes, a, superfluid, at, temperatures, close, to, absolute, zero, similarly, superconductivity, arises, because, some, quasiparticles, such, as, cooper, pairs, behave, in, the, same, way, the, name, boson, was, coined, by, paul, dirac, to, commemorate, the, contribution, of, satyendra, nath, bose, an, indian, physicist, when, bose, was, a, reader, later, professor, at, the, university, of, dhaka, bengal, now, in, bangladesh, he, and, albert, einstein, developed, the, theory, characterising, such, particles, now, known, as, bose, einstein, statistics, and, bose, einstein, condensate, all, observed, elementary, particles, are, either, bosons, with, integer, spin, or, fermions, with, odd, half, integer, spin, whereas, the, elementary, particles, that, make, up, ordinary, matter, leptons, and, quarks, are, fermions, elementary, bosons, occupy, a, special, role, in, particle, physics, they, act, either, as, force, carriers, which, give, rise, to, forces, between, other, particles, or, in, one, case, give, rise, to, the, phenomenon, of, mass, according, to, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, there, are, five, elementary, bosons, composite, particles, such, as, hadrons, nuclei, and, atoms, can, be, bosons, or, fermions, depending, on, their, constituents, since, bosons, have, integer, spin, and, fermions, odd, half, integer, spin, any, composite, particle, made, up, of, an, even, number, of, fermions, is, a, boson, composite, bosons, include, as, quantum, particles, the, behaviour, of, multiple, indistinguishable, bosons, at, high, densities, is, described, by, bose, einstein, statistics, one, characteristic, which, becomes, important, in, superfluidity, and, other, applications, of, bose, einstein, condensates, is, that, there, is, no, restriction, on, the, number, of, bosons, that, may, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, as, a, consequence, when, for, example, a, gas, of, helium, 4, atoms, is, cooled, to, temperatures, very, close, to, absolute, zero, and, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, particles, becomes, negligible, it, condenses, into, a, low, energy, state, and, becomes, a, superfluid, certain, quasiparticles, are, observed, to, behave, as, bosons, and, to, follow, bose, einstein, statistics, including, cooper, pairs, plasmons, and, phonons, 130, each, of, the, five, has, integer, nonzero, spin
