hydrology, from, ancient, greek, h, d, r, water, and, log, a, study, of, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, movement, distribution, and, management, of, water, on, earth, and, other, planets, including, the, water, cycle, water, resources, and, drainage, basin, sustainability, a, practitioner, of, hydrology, is, called, a, hydrologist, hydrologists, are, scientists, studying, earth, or, environmental, science, civil, or, environmental, engineering, and, physical, geography, using, various, analytical, methods, and, scientific, techniques, they, collect, and, analyze, data, to, help, solve, water, related, problems, such, as, environmental, preservation, natural, disasters, and, water, management, hydrology, subdivides, into, surface, water, hydrology, groundwater, hydrology, hydrogeology, and, marine, hydrology, domains, of, hydrology, include, hydrometeorology, surface, hydrology, hydrogeology, drainage, basin, management, and, water, quality, oceanography, and, meteorology, are, not, included, because, water, is, only, one, of, many, important, aspects, within, those, fields, hydrological, research, can, inform, environmental, engineering, policy, and, planning, hydrology, has, been, subject, to, investigation, and, engineering, for, millennia, ancient, egyptians, were, one, of, the, first, to, employ, hydrology, in, their, engineering, and, agriculture, inventing, a, form, of, water, management, known, as, basin, irrigation, mesopotamian, towns, were, protected, from, flooding, with, high, earthen, walls, aqueducts, were, built, by, the, greeks, and, romans, while, history, shows, that, the, chinese, built, irrigation, and, flood, control, works, the, ancient, sinhalese, used, hydrology, to, build, complex, irrigation, works, in, sri, lanka, also, known, for, the, invention, of, the, valve, pit, which, allowed, construction, of, large, reservoirs, anicuts, and, canals, which, still, function, marcus, vitruvius, in, the, first, century, bc, described, a, philosophical, theory, of, the, hydrologic, cycle, in, which, precipitation, falling, in, the, mountains, infiltrated, the, earth, s, surface, and, led, to, streams, and, springs, in, the, lowlands, with, the, adoption, of, a, more, scientific, approach, leonardo, da, vinci, and, bernard, palissy, independently, reached, an, accurate, representation, of, the, hydrologic, cycle, it, was, not, until, the, 17th, century, that, hydrologic, variables, began, to, be, quantified, pioneers, of, the, modern, science, of, hydrology, include, pierre, perrault, edme, mariotte, and, edmund, halley, by, measuring, rainfall, runoff, and, drainage, area, perrault, showed, that, rainfall, was, sufficient, to, account, for, the, flow, of, the, seine, mariotte, combined, velocity, and, river, cross, section, measurements, to, obtain, a, discharge, value, again, in, the, seine, halley, showed, that, the, evaporation, from, the, mediterranean, sea, was, sufficient, to, account, for, the, outflow, of, rivers, flowing, into, the, sea, advances, in, the, 18th, century, included, the, bernoulli, piezometer, and, bernoulli, s, equation, by, daniel, bernoulli, and, the, pitot, tube, by, henri, pitot, the, 19th, century, saw, development, in, groundwater, hydrology, including, darcy, s, law, the, dupuit, thiem, well, formula, and, hagen, poiseuille, s, capillary, flow, equation, rational, analyses, began, to, replace, empiricism, in, the, 20th, century, while, governmental, agencies, began, their, own, hydrological, research, programs, of, particular, importance, were, leroy, sherman, s, unit, hydrograph, the, infiltration, theory, of, robert, e, horton, and, c, v, theis, aquifer, test, equation, describing, well, hydraulics, since, the, 1950s, hydrology, has, been, approached, with, a, more, theoretical, basis, than, in, the, past, facilitated, by, advances, in, the, physical, understanding, of, hydrological, processes, and, by, the, advent, of, computers, and, especially, geographic, information, systems, gis, see, also, gis, and, hydrology, the, central, theme, of, hydrology, is, that, water, circulates, throughout, the, earth, through, different, pathways, and, at, different, rates, the, most, vivid, image, of, this, is, in, the, evaporation, of, water, from, the, ocean, which, forms, clouds, these, clouds, drift, over, the, land, and, produce, rain, the, rainwater, flows, into, lakes, rivers, or, aquifers, the, water, in, lakes, rivers, and, aquifers, then, either, evaporates, back, to, the, atmosphere, or, eventually, flows, back, to, the, ocean, completing, a, cycle, water, changes, its, state, of, being, several, times, throughout, this, cycle, the, areas, of, research, within, hydrology, concern, the, movement, of, water, between, its, various, states, or, within, a, given, state, or, simply, quantifying, the, amounts, in, these, states, in, a, given, region, parts, of, hydrology, concern, developing, methods, for, directly, measuring, these, flows, or, amounts, of, water, while, others, concern, modeling, these, processes, either, for, scientific, knowledge, or, for, making, a, prediction, in, practical, applications, ground, water, is, water, beneath, earth, s, surface, often, pumped, for, drinking, water, groundwater, hydrology, hydrogeology, considers, quantifying, groundwater, flow, and, solute, transport, problems, in, describing, the, saturated, zone, include, the, characterization, of, aquifers, in, terms, of, flow, direction, groundwater, pressure, and, by, inference, groundwater, depth, see, aquifer, test, measurements, here, can, be, made, using, a, piezometer, aquifers, are, also, described, in, terms, of, hydraulic, conductivity, storativity, and, transmissivity, there, are, a, number, of, geophysical, methods, for, characterizing, aquifers, there, are, also, problems, in, characterizing, the, vadose, zone, unsaturated, zone, infiltration, is, the, process, by, which, water, enters, the, soil, some, of, the, water, is, absorbed, and, the, rest, percolates, down, to, the, water, table, the, infiltration, capacity, the, maximum, rate, at, which, the, soil, can, absorb, water, depends, on, several, factors, the, layer, that, is, already, saturated, provides, a, resistance, that, is, proportional, to, its, thickness, while, that, plus, the, depth, of, water, above, the, soil, provides, the, driving, force, hydraulic, head, dry, soil, can, allow, rapid, infiltration, by, capillary, action, this, force, diminishes, as, the, soil, becomes, wet, compaction, reduces, the, porosity, and, the, pore, sizes, surface, cover, increases, capacity, by, retarding, runoff, reducing, compaction, and, other, processes, higher, temperatures, reduce, viscosity, increasing, infiltration, 250, 275, soil, moisture, can, be, measured, in, various, ways, by, capacitance, probe, time, domain, reflectometer, or, tensiometer, other, methods, include, solute, sampling, and, geophysical, methods, hydrology, considers, quantifying, surface, water, flow, and, solute, transport, although, the, treatment, of, flows, in, large, rivers, is, sometimes, considered, as, a, distinct, topic, of, hydraulics, or, hydrodynamics, surface, water, flow, can, include, flow, both, in, recognizable, river, channels, and, otherwise, methods, for, measuring, flow, once, the, water, has, reached, a, river, include, the, stream, gauge, see, discharge, and, tracer, techniques, other, topics, include, chemical, transport, as, part, of, surface, water, sediment, transport, and, erosion, one, of, the, important, areas, of, hydrology, is, the, interchange, between, rivers, and, aquifers, groundwater, surface, water, interactions, in, streams, and, aquifers, can, be, complex, and, the, direction, of, net, water, flux, into, surface, water, or, into, the, aquifer, may, vary, spatially, along, a, stream, channel, and, over, time, at, any, particular, location, depending, on, the, relationship, between, stream, stage, and, groundwater, levels, in, some, considerations, hydrology, is, thought, of, as, starting, at, the, land, atmosphere, boundary, and, so, it, is, important, to, have, adequate, knowledge, of, both, precipitation, and, evaporation, precipitation, can, be, measured, in, various, ways, disdrometer, for, precipitation, characteristics, at, a, fine, time, scale, radar, for, cloud, properties, rain, rate, estimation, hail, and, snow, detection, rain, gauge, for, routine, accurate, measurements, of, rain, and, snowfall, satellite, for, rainy, area, identification, rain, rate, estimation, land, cover, land, use, and, soil, moisture, for, example, evaporation, is, an, important, part, of, the, water, cycle, it, is, partly, affected, by, humidity, which, can, be, measured, by, a, sling, psychrometer, it, is, also, affected, by, the, presence, of, snow, hail, and, ice, and, can, relate, to, dew, mist, and, fog, hydrology, considers, evaporation, of, various, forms, from, water, surfaces, as, transpiration, from, plant, surfaces, in, natural, and, agronomic, ecosystems, direct, measurement, of, evaporation, can, be, obtained, using, simon, s, evaporation, pan, detailed, studies, of, evaporation, involve, boundary, layer, considerations, as, well, as, momentum, heat, flux, and, energy, budgets, remote, sensing, of, hydrologic, processes, can, provide, information, on, locations, where, in, situ, sensors, may, be, unavailable, or, sparse, it, also, enables, observations, over, large, spatial, extents, many, of, the, variables, constituting, the, terrestrial, water, balance, for, example, surface, water, storage, soil, moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and, snow, and, ice, are, measurable, using, remote, sensing, at, various, spatial, temporal, resolutions, and, accuracies, sources, of, remote, sensing, include, land, based, sensors, airborne, sensors, and, satellite, sensors, which, can, capture, microwave, thermal, and, near, infrared, data, or, use, lidar, for, example, in, hydrology, studies, of, water, quality, concern, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, and, both, dissolved, and, sediment, material, in, addition, water, quality, is, affected, by, the, interaction, of, dissolved, oxygen, with, organic, material, and, various, chemical, transformations, that, may, take, place, measurements, of, water, quality, may, involve, either, in, situ, methods, in, which, analyses, take, place, on, site, often, automatically, and, laboratory, based, analyses, and, may, include, microbiological, analysis, observations, of, hydrologic, processes, are, used, to, make, predictions, of, the, future, behavior, of, hydrologic, systems, water, flow, water, quality, one, of, the, major, current, concerns, in, hydrologic, research, is, prediction, in, ungauged, basins, pub, i, e, in, basins, where, no, or, only, very, few, data, exist, the, aims, of, statistical, hydrology, is, to, provide, appropriate, statistical, methods, for, analyzing, and, modeling, various, parts, of, the, hydrological, cycle, by, analyzing, the, statistical, properties, of, hydrologic, records, such, as, rainfall, or, river, flow, hydrologists, can, estimate, future, hydrologic, phenomena, when, making, assessments, of, how, often, relatively, rare, events, will, occur, analyses, are, made, in, terms, of, the, return, period, of, such, events, other, quantities, of, interest, include, the, average, flow, in, a, river, in, a, year, or, by, season, these, estimates, are, important, for, engineers, and, economists, so, that, proper, risk, analysis, can, be, performed, to, influence, investment, decisions, in, future, infrastructure, and, to, determine, the, yield, reliability, characteristics, of, water, supply, systems, statistical, information, is, utilized, to, formulate, operating, rules, for, large, dams, forming, part, of, systems, which, include, agricultural, industrial, and, residential, demands, hydrological, models, are, simplified, conceptual, representations, of, a, part, of, the, hydrologic, cycle, they, are, primarily, used, for, hydrological, prediction, and, for, understanding, hydrological, processes, within, the, general, field, of, scientific, modeling, two, major, types, of, hydrological, models, can, be, distinguished, recent, research, in, hydrological, modeling, tries, to, have, a, more, global, approach, to, the, understanding, of, the, behavior, of, hydrologic, systems, to, make, better, predictions, and, to, face, the, major, challenges, in, water, resources, management, water, movement, is, a, significant, means, by, which, other, materials, such, as, soil, gravel, boulders, or, pollutants, are, transported, from, place, to, place, initial, input, to, receiving, waters, may, arise, from, a, point, source, discharge, or, a, line, source, or, area, source, such, as, surface, runoff, since, the, 1960s, rather, complex, mathematical, models, have, been, developed, facilitated, by, the, availability, of, high, speed, computers, the, most, common, pollutant, classes, analyzed, are, nutrients, pesticides, total, dissolved, solids, and, sediment
