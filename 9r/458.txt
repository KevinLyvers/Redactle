an, acid, is, a, molecule, or, ion, capable, of, either, donating, a, proton, i, e, hydrogen, ion, h, known, as, a, br, nsted, lowry, acid, or, forming, a, covalent, bond, with, an, electron, pair, known, as, a, lewis, acid, the, first, category, of, acids, are, the, proton, donors, or, br, nsted, lowry, acids, in, the, special, case, of, aqueous, solutions, proton, donors, form, the, hydronium, ion, h, 3, o, and, are, known, as, arrhenius, acids, br, nsted, and, lowry, generalized, the, arrhenius, theory, to, include, non, aqueous, solvents, a, br, nsted, or, arrhenius, acid, usually, contains, a, hydrogen, atom, bonded, to, a, chemical, structure, that, is, still, energetically, favorable, after, loss, of, h, aqueous, arrhenius, acids, have, characteristic, properties, that, provide, a, practical, description, of, an, acid, acids, form, aqueous, solutions, with, a, sour, taste, can, turn, blue, litmus, red, and, react, with, bases, and, certain, metals, like, calcium, to, form, salts, the, word, acid, is, derived, from, the, latin, acidus, meaning, sour, an, aqueous, solution, of, an, acid, has, a, ph, less, than, 7, and, is, colloquially, also, referred, to, as, acid, as, in, dissolved, in, acid, while, the, strict, definition, refers, only, to, the, solute, a, lower, ph, means, a, higher, acidity, and, thus, a, higher, concentration, of, positive, hydrogen, ions, in, the, solution, chemicals, or, substances, having, the, property, of, an, acid, are, said, to, be, acidic, common, aqueous, acids, include, hydrochloric, acid, a, solution, of, hydrogen, chloride, that, is, found, in, gastric, acid, in, the, stomach, and, activates, digestive, enzymes, acetic, acid, vinegar, is, a, dilute, aqueous, solution, of, this, liquid, sulfuric, acid, used, in, car, batteries, and, citric, acid, found, in, citrus, fruits, as, these, examples, show, acids, in, the, colloquial, sense, can, be, solutions, or, pure, substances, and, can, be, derived, from, acids, in, the, strict, sense, that, are, solids, liquids, or, gases, strong, acids, and, some, concentrated, weak, acids, are, corrosive, but, there, are, exceptions, such, as, carboranes, and, boric, acid, the, second, category, of, acids, are, lewis, acids, which, form, a, covalent, bond, with, an, electron, pair, an, example, is, boron, trifluoride, bf, 3, whose, boron, atom, has, a, vacant, orbital, that, can, form, a, covalent, bond, by, sharing, a, lone, pair, of, electrons, on, an, atom, in, a, base, for, example, the, nitrogen, atom, in, ammonia, nh, 3, lewis, considered, this, as, a, generalization, of, the, br, nsted, definition, so, that, an, acid, is, a, chemical, species, that, accepts, electron, pairs, either, directly, or, by, releasing, protons, h, into, the, solution, which, then, accept, electron, pairs, hydrogen, chloride, acetic, acid, and, most, other, br, nsted, lowry, acids, cannot, form, a, covalent, bond, with, an, electron, pair, however, and, are, therefore, not, lewis, acids, conversely, many, lewis, acids, are, not, arrhenius, or, br, nsted, lowry, acids, in, modern, terminology, an, acid, is, implicitly, a, br, nsted, acid, and, not, a, lewis, acid, since, chemists, almost, always, refer, to, a, lewis, acid, explicitly, as, such, modern, definitions, are, concerned, with, the, fundamental, chemical, reactions, common, to, all, acids, most, acids, encountered, in, everyday, life, are, aqueous, solutions, or, can, be, dissolved, in, water, so, the, arrhenius, and, br, nsted, lowry, definitions, are, the, most, relevant, the, br, nsted, lowry, definition, is, the, most, widely, used, definition, unless, otherwise, specified, acid, base, reactions, are, assumed, to, involve, the, transfer, of, a, proton, h, from, an, acid, to, a, base, hydronium, ions, are, acids, according, to, all, three, definitions, although, alcohols, and, amines, can, be, br, nsted, lowry, acids, they, can, also, function, as, lewis, bases, due, to, the, lone, pairs, of, electrons, on, their, oxygen, and, nitrogen, atoms, in, 1884, svante, arrhenius, attributed, the, properties, of, acidity, to, hydrogen, ions, h, later, described, as, protons, or, hydrons, an, arrhenius, acid, is, a, substance, that, when, added, to, water, increases, the, concentration, of, h, ions, in, the, water, chemists, often, write, h, aq, and, refer, to, the, hydrogen, ion, when, describing, acid, base, reactions, but, the, free, hydrogen, nucleus, a, proton, does, not, exist, alone, in, water, it, exists, as, the, hydronium, ion, h, 3, o, or, other, forms, h, 5, o, 2, h, 9, o, 4, thus, an, arrhenius, acid, can, also, be, described, as, a, substance, that, increases, the, concentration, of, hydronium, ions, when, added, to, water, examples, include, molecular, substances, such, as, hydrogen, chloride, and, acetic, acid, an, arrhenius, base, on, the, other, hand, is, a, substance, that, increases, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, oh, ions, when, dissolved, in, water, this, decreases, the, concentration, of, hydronium, because, the, ions, react, to, form, h, 2, o, molecules, due, to, this, equilibrium, any, increase, in, the, concentration, of, hydronium, is, accompanied, by, a, decrease, in, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, thus, an, arrhenius, acid, could, also, be, said, to, be, one, that, decreases, hydroxide, concentration, while, an, arrhenius, base, increases, it, in, an, acidic, solution, the, concentration, of, hydronium, ions, is, greater, than, 10, 7, moles, per, liter, since, ph, is, defined, as, the, negative, logarithm, of, the, concentration, of, hydronium, ions, acidic, solutions, thus, have, a, ph, of, less, than, 7, while, the, arrhenius, concept, is, useful, for, describing, many, reactions, it, is, also, quite, limited, in, its, scope, in, 1923, chemists, johannes, nicolaus, br, nsted, and, thomas, martin, lowry, independently, recognized, that, acid, base, reactions, involve, the, transfer, of, a, proton, a, br, nsted, lowry, acid, or, simply, br, nsted, acid, is, a, species, that, donates, a, proton, to, a, br, nsted, lowry, base, br, nsted, lowry, acid, base, theory, has, several, advantages, over, arrhenius, theory, consider, the, following, reactions, of, acetic, acid, ch, 3, cooh, the, organic, acid, that, gives, vinegar, its, characteristic, taste, both, theories, easily, describe, the, first, reaction, ch, 3, cooh, acts, as, an, arrhenius, acid, because, it, acts, as, a, source, of, h, 3, o, when, dissolved, in, water, and, it, acts, as, a, br, nsted, acid, by, donating, a, proton, to, water, in, the, second, example, ch, 3, cooh, undergoes, the, same, transformation, in, this, case, donating, a, proton, to, ammonia, nh, 3, but, does, not, relate, to, the, arrhenius, definition, of, an, acid, because, the, reaction, does, not, produce, hydronium, nevertheless, ch, 3, cooh, is, both, an, arrhenius, and, a, br, nsted, lowry, acid, br, nsted, lowry, theory, can, be, used, to, describe, reactions, of, molecular, compounds, in, nonaqueous, solution, or, the, gas, phase, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, and, ammonia, combine, under, several, different, conditions, to, form, ammonium, chloride, nh, 4, cl, in, aqueous, solution, hcl, behaves, as, hydrochloric, acid, and, exists, as, hydronium, and, chloride, ions, the, following, reactions, illustrate, the, limitations, of, arrhenius, s, definition, as, with, the, acetic, acid, reactions, both, definitions, work, for, the, first, example, where, water, is, the, solvent, and, hydronium, ion, is, formed, by, the, hcl, solute, the, next, two, reactions, do, not, involve, the, formation, of, ions, but, are, still, proton, transfer, reactions, in, the, second, reaction, hydrogen, chloride, and, ammonia, dissolved, in, benzene, react, to, form, solid, ammonium, chloride, in, a, benzene, solvent, and, in, the, third, gaseous, hcl, and, nh, 3, combine, to, form, the, solid, a, third, only, marginally, related, concept, was, proposed, in, 1923, by, gilbert, n, lewis, which, includes, reactions, with, acid, base, characteristics, that, do, not, involve, a, proton, transfer, a, lewis, acid, is, a, species, that, accepts, a, pair, of, electrons, from, another, species, in, other, words, it, is, an, electron, pair, acceptor, br, nsted, acid, base, reactions, are, proton, transfer, reactions, while, lewis, acid, base, reactions, are, electron, pair, transfers, many, lewis, acids, are, not, br, nsted, lowry, acids, contrast, how, the, following, reactions, are, described, in, terms, of, acid, base, chemistry, in, the, first, reaction, a, fluoride, ion, f, gives, up, an, electron, pair, to, boron, trifluoride, to, form, the, product, tetrafluoroborate, fluoride, loses, a, pair, of, valence, electrons, because, the, electrons, shared, in, the, b, f, bond, are, located, in, the, region, of, space, between, the, two, atomic, nuclei, and, are, therefore, more, distant, from, the, fluoride, nucleus, than, they, are, in, the, lone, fluoride, ion, bf, 3, is, a, lewis, acid, because, it, accepts, the, electron, pair, from, fluoride, this, reaction, cannot, be, described, in, terms, of, br, nsted, theory, because, there, is, no, proton, transfer, the, second, reaction, can, be, described, using, either, theory, a, proton, is, transferred, from, an, unspecified, br, nsted, acid, to, ammonia, a, br, nsted, base, alternatively, ammonia, acts, as, a, lewis, base, and, transfers, a, lone, pair, of, electrons, to, form, a, bond, with, a, hydrogen, ion, the, species, that, gains, the, electron, pair, is, the, lewis, acid, for, example, the, oxygen, atom, in, h, 3, o, gains, a, pair, of, electrons, when, one, of, the, h, o, bonds, is, broken, and, the, electrons, shared, in, the, bond, become, localized, on, oxygen, depending, on, the, context, a, lewis, acid, may, also, be, described, as, an, oxidizer, or, an, electrophile, organic, br, nsted, acids, such, as, acetic, citric, or, oxalic, acid, are, not, lewis, acids, they, dissociate, in, water, to, produce, a, lewis, acid, h, but, at, the, same, time, they, also, yield, an, equal, amount, of, a, lewis, base, acetate, citrate, or, oxalate, respectively, for, the, acids, mentioned, this, article, deals, mostly, with, br, nsted, acids, rather, than, lewis, acids, reactions, of, acids, are, often, generalized, in, the, form, ha, h, a, where, ha, represents, the, acid, and, a, is, the, conjugate, base, this, reaction, is, referred, to, as, protolysis, the, protonated, form, ha, of, an, acid, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, free, acid, acid, base, conjugate, pairs, differ, by, one, proton, and, can, be, interconverted, by, the, addition, or, removal, of, a, proton, protonation, and, deprotonation, respectively, the, acid, can, be, the, charged, species, and, the, conjugate, base, can, be, neutral, in, which, case, the, generalized, reaction, scheme, could, be, written, as, ha, h, a, in, solution, there, exists, an, equilibrium, between, the, acid, and, its, conjugate, base, the, equilibrium, constant, k, is, an, expression, of, the, equilibrium, concentrations, of, the, molecules, or, the, ions, in, solution, brackets, indicate, concentration, such, that, means, the, concentration, of, h, 2, o, the, acid, dissociation, constant, k, a, is, generally, used, in, the, context, of, acid, base, reactions, the, numerical, value, of, k, a, is, equal, to, the, product, multiplication, of, the, concentrations, of, the, products, divided, by, the, concentration, of, the, reactants, where, the, reactant, is, the, acid, ha, and, the, products, are, the, conjugate, base, and, h, the, stronger, of, two, acids, will, have, a, higher, k, a, than, the, weaker, acid, the, ratio, of, hydrogen, ions, to, acid, will, be, higher, for, the, stronger, acid, as, the, stronger, acid, has, a, greater, tendency, to, lose, its, proton, because, the, range, of, possible, values, for, k, a, spans, many, orders, of, magnitude, a, more, manageable, constant, p, k, a, is, more, frequently, used, where, p, k, a, log, 10, k, a, stronger, acids, have, a, smaller, p, k, a, than, weaker, acids, experimentally, determined, p, k, a, at, 25, c, in, aqueous, solution, are, often, quoted, in, textbooks, and, reference, material, arrhenius, acids, are, named, according, to, their, anions, in, the, classical, naming, system, the, ionic, suffix, is, dropped, and, replaced, with, a, new, suffix, according, to, the, table, following, the, prefix, hydro, is, used, when, the, acid, is, made, up, of, just, hydrogen, and, one, other, element, for, example, hcl, has, chloride, as, its, anion, so, the, hydro, prefix, is, used, and, the, ide, suffix, makes, the, name, take, the, form, hydrochloric, acid, classical, naming, system, in, the, iupac, naming, system, aqueous, is, simply, added, to, the, name, of, the, ionic, compound, thus, for, hydrogen, chloride, as, an, acid, solution, the, iupac, name, is, aqueous, hydrogen, chloride, the, strength, of, an, acid, refers, to, its, ability, or, tendency, to, lose, a, proton, a, strong, acid, is, one, that, completely, dissociates, in, water, in, other, words, one, mole, of, a, strong, acid, ha, dissolves, in, water, yielding, one, mole, of, h, and, one, mole, of, the, conjugate, base, a, and, none, of, the, protonated, acid, ha, in, contrast, a, weak, acid, only, partially, dissociates, and, at, equilibrium, both, the, acid, and, the, conjugate, base, are, in, solution, examples, of, strong, acids, are, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, hydroiodic, acid, hi, hydrobromic, acid, hbr, perchloric, acid, hclo, 4, nitric, acid, hno, 3, and, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, in, water, each, of, these, essentially, ionizes, 100, the, stronger, an, acid, is, the, more, easily, it, loses, a, proton, h, two, key, factors, that, contribute, to, the, ease, of, deprotonation, are, the, polarity, of, the, h, a, bond, and, the, size, of, atom, a, which, determines, the, strength, of, the, h, a, bond, acid, strengths, are, also, often, discussed, in, terms, of, the, stability, of, the, conjugate, base, stronger, acids, have, a, larger, acid, dissociation, constant, k, a, and, a, lower, p, k, a, than, weaker, acids, sulfonic, acids, which, are, organic, oxyacids, are, a, class, of, strong, acids, a, common, example, is, toluenesulfonic, acid, tosylic, acid, unlike, sulfuric, acid, itself, sulfonic, acids, can, be, solids, in, fact, polystyrene, functionalized, into, polystyrene, sulfonate, is, a, solid, strongly, acidic, plastic, that, is, filterable, superacids, are, acids, stronger, than, 100, sulfuric, acid, examples, of, superacids, are, fluoroantimonic, acid, magic, acid, and, perchloric, acid, the, strongest, known, acid, is, helium, hydride, ion, with, a, proton, affinity, of, 177, 8kj, mol, superacids, can, permanently, protonate, water, to, give, ionic, crystalline, hydronium, salts, they, can, also, quantitatively, stabilize, carbocations, while, k, a, measures, the, strength, of, an, acid, compound, the, strength, of, an, aqueous, acid, solution, is, measured, by, ph, which, is, an, indication, of, the, concentration, of, hydronium, in, the, solution, the, ph, of, a, simple, solution, of, an, acid, compound, in, water, is, determined, by, the, dilution, of, the, compound, and, the, compound, s, k, a, lewis, acids, have, been, classified, in, the, ecw, model, and, it, has, been, shown, that, there, is, no, one, order, of, acid, strengths, the, relative, acceptor, strength, of, lewis, acids, toward, a, series, of, bases, versus, other, lewis, acids, can, be, illustrated, by, c, b, plots, it, has, been, shown, that, to, define, the, order, of, lewis, acid, strength, at, least, two, properties, must, be, considered, for, pearson, s, qualitative, hsab, theory, the, two, properties, are, hardness, and, strength, while, for, drago, s, quantitative, ecw, model, the, two, properties, are, electrostatic, and, covalent, monoprotic, acids, also, known, as, monobasic, acids, are, those, acids, that, are, able, to, donate, one, proton, per, molecule, during, the, process, of, dissociation, sometimes, called, ionization, as, shown, below, symbolized, by, ha, common, examples, of, monoprotic, acids, in, mineral, acids, include, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, and, nitric, acid, hno, 3, on, the, other, hand, for, organic, acids, the, term, mainly, indicates, the, presence, of, one, carboxylic, acid, group, and, sometimes, these, acids, are, known, as, monocarboxylic, acid, examples, in, organic, acids, include, formic, acid, hcooh, acetic, acid, ch, 3, cooh, and, benzoic, acid, c, 6, h, 5, cooh, polyprotic, acids, also, known, as, polybasic, acids, are, able, to, donate, more, than, one, proton, per, acid, molecule, in, contrast, to, monoprotic, acids, that, only, donate, one, proton, per, molecule, specific, types, of, polyprotic, acids, have, more, specific, names, such, as, diprotic, or, dibasic, acid, two, potential, protons, to, donate, and, triprotic, or, tribasic, acid, three, potential, protons, to, donate, some, macromolecules, such, as, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, can, have, a, very, large, number, of, acidic, protons, a, diprotic, acid, here, symbolized, by, h, 2, a, can, undergo, one, or, two, dissociations, depending, on, the, ph, each, dissociation, has, its, own, dissociation, constant, k, a1, and, k, a2, the, first, dissociation, constant, is, typically, greater, than, the, second, i, e, k, a1, k, a2, for, example, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, can, donate, one, proton, to, form, the, bisulfate, anion, hso, 4, for, which, k, a1, is, very, large, then, it, can, donate, a, second, proton, to, form, the, sulfate, anion, so, 2, 4, wherein, the, k, a2, is, intermediate, strength, the, large, k, a1, for, the, first, dissociation, makes, sulfuric, a, strong, acid, in, a, similar, manner, the, weak, unstable, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, can, lose, one, proton, to, form, bicarbonate, anion, hco, 3, and, lose, a, second, to, form, carbonate, anion, co, 2, 3, both, k, a, values, are, small, but, k, a1, k, a2, a, triprotic, acid, h, 3, a, can, undergo, one, two, or, three, dissociations, and, has, three, dissociation, constants, where, k, a1, k, a2, k, a3, an, inorganic, example, of, a, triprotic, acid, is, orthophosphoric, acid, h, 3, po, 4, usually, just, called, phosphoric, acid, all, three, protons, can, be, successively, lost, to, yield, h, 2, po, 4, then, hpo, 2, 4, and, finally, po, 3, 4, the, orthophosphate, ion, usually, just, called, phosphate, even, though, the, positions, of, the, three, protons, on, the, original, phosphoric, acid, molecule, are, equivalent, the, successive, k, a, values, differ, since, it, is, energetically, less, favorable, to, lose, a, proton, if, the, conjugate, base, is, more, negatively, charged, an, organic, example, of, a, triprotic, acid, is, citric, acid, which, can, successively, lose, three, protons, to, finally, form, the, citrate, ion, although, the, subsequent, loss, of, each, hydrogen, ion, is, less, favorable, all, of, the, conjugate, bases, are, present, in, solution, the, fractional, concentration, alpha, for, each, species, can, be, calculated, for, example, a, generic, diprotic, acid, will, generate, 3, species, in, solution, h, 2, a, ha, and, a, 2, the, fractional, concentrations, can, be, calculated, as, below, when, given, either, the, ph, which, can, be, converted, to, the, or, the, concentrations, of, the, acid, with, all, its, conjugate, bases, a, plot, of, these, fractional, concentrations, against, ph, for, given, k, 1, and, k, 2, is, known, as, a, bjerrum, plot, a, pattern, is, observed, in, the, above, equations, and, can, be, expanded, to, the, general, n, protic, acid, that, has, been, deprotonated, i, times, where, k, 0, 1, and, the, other, k, terms, are, the, dissociation, constants, for, the, acid, neutralization, is, the, reaction, between, an, acid, and, a, base, producing, a, salt, and, neutralized, base, for, example, hydrochloric, acid, and, sodium, hydroxide, form, sodium, chloride, and, water, neutralization, is, the, basis, of, titration, where, a, ph, indicator, shows, equivalence, point, when, the, equivalent, number, of, moles, of, a, base, have, been, added, to, an, acid, it, is, often, wrongly, assumed, that, neutralization, should, result, in, a, solution, with, ph, 7, 0, which, is, only, the, case, with, similar, acid, and, base, strengths, during, a, reaction, neutralization, with, a, base, weaker, than, the, acid, results, in, a, weakly, acidic, salt, an, example, is, the, weakly, acidic, ammonium, chloride, which, is, produced, from, the, strong, acid, hydrogen, chloride, and, the, weak, base, ammonia, conversely, neutralizing, a, weak, acid, with, a, strong, base, gives, a, weakly, basic, salt, e, g, sodium, fluoride, from, hydrogen, fluoride, and, sodium, hydroxide, in, order, for, a, protonated, acid, to, lose, a, proton, the, ph, of, the, system, must, rise, above, the, p, k, a, of, the, acid, the, decreased, concentration, of, h, in, that, basic, solution, shifts, the, equilibrium, towards, the, conjugate, base, form, the, deprotonated, form, of, the, acid, in, lower, ph, more, acidic, solutions, there, is, a, high, enough, h, concentration, in, the, solution, to, cause, the, acid, to, remain, in, its, protonated, form, solutions, of, weak, acids, and, salts, of, their, conjugate, bases, form, buffer, solutions, to, determine, the, concentration, of, an, acid, in, an, aqueous, solution, an, acid, base, titration, is, commonly, performed, a, strong, base, solution, with, a, known, concentration, usually, naoh, or, koh, is, added, to, neutralize, the, acid, solution, according, to, the, color, change, of, the, indicator, with, the, amount, of, base, added, the, titration, curve, of, an, acid, titrated, by, a, base, has, two, axes, with, the, base, volume, on, the, x, axis, and, the, solution, s, ph, value, on, the, y, axis, the, ph, of, the, solution, always, goes, up, as, the, base, is, added, to, the, solution, for, each, diprotic, acid, titration, curve, from, left, to, right, there, are, two, midpoints, two, equivalence, points, and, two, buffer, regions, due, to, the, successive, dissociation, processes, there, are, two, equivalence, points, in, the, titration, curve, of, a, diprotic, acid, the, first, equivalence, point, occurs, when, all, first, hydrogen, ions, from, the, first, ionization, are, titrated, in, other, words, the, amount, of, oh, added, equals, the, original, amount, of, h, 2, a, at, the, first, equivalence, point, the, second, equivalence, point, occurs, when, all, hydrogen, ions, are, titrated, therefore, the, amount, of, oh, added, equals, twice, the, amount, of, h, 2, a, at, this, time, for, a, weak, diprotic, acid, titrated, by, a, strong, base, the, second, equivalence, point, must, occur, at, ph, above, 7, due, to, the, hydrolysis, of, the, resulted, salts, in, the, solution, at, either, equivalence, point, adding, a, drop, of, base, will, cause, the, steepest, rise, of, the, ph, value, in, the, system, a, titration, curve, for, a, diprotic, acid, contains, two, midpoints, where, ph, pk, a, since, there, are, two, different, k, a, values, the, first, midpoint, occurs, at, ph, pk, a1, and, the, second, one, occurs, at, ph, pk, a2, each, segment, of, the, curve, that, contains, a, midpoint, at, its, center, is, called, the, buffer, region, because, the, buffer, regions, consist, of, the, acid, and, its, conjugate, base, it, can, resist, ph, changes, when, base, is, added, until, the, next, equivalent, points, acids, are, fundamental, reagents, in, treating, almost, all, processes, in, modern, industry, sulfuric, acid, a, diprotic, acid, is, the, most, widely, used, acid, in, industry, and, is, also, the, most, produced, industrial, chemical, in, the, world, it, is, mainly, used, in, producing, fertilizer, detergent, batteries, and, dyes, as, well, as, used, in, processing, many, products, such, like, removing, impurities, according, to, the, statistics, data, in, 2011, the, annual, production, of, sulfuric, acid, was, around, 200, million, tonnes, in, the, world, for, example, phosphate, minerals, react, with, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, phosphoric, acid, for, the, production, of, phosphate, fertilizers, and, zinc, is, produced, by, dissolving, zinc, oxide, into, sulfuric, acid, purifying, the, solution, and, electrowinning, in, the, chemical, industry, acids, react, in, neutralization, reactions, to, produce, salts, for, example, nitric, acid, reacts, with, ammonia, to, produce, ammonium, nitrate, a, fertilizer, additionally, carboxylic, acids, can, be, esterified, with, alcohols, to, produce, esters, acids, are, often, used, to, remove, rust, and, other, corrosion, from, metals, in, a, process, known, as, pickling, they, may, be, used, as, an, electrolyte, in, a, wet, cell, battery, such, as, sulfuric, acid, in, a, car, battery, tartaric, acid, is, an, important, component, of, some, commonly, used, foods, like, unripened, mangoes, and, tamarind, natural, fruits, and, vegetables, also, contain, acids, citric, acid, is, present, in, oranges, lemon, and, other, citrus, fruits, oxalic, acid, is, present, in, tomatoes, spinach, and, especially, in, carambola, and, rhubarb, rhubarb, leaves, and, unripe, carambolas, are, toxic, because, of, high, concentrations, of, oxalic, acid, ascorbic, acid, vitamin, c, is, an, essential, vitamin, for, the, human, body, and, is, present, in, such, foods, as, amla, indian, gooseberry, lemon, citrus, fruits, and, guava, many, acids, can, be, found, in, various, kinds, of, food, as, additives, as, they, alter, their, taste, and, serve, as, preservatives, phosphoric, acid, for, example, is, a, component, of, cola, drinks, acetic, acid, is, used, in, day, to, day, life, as, vinegar, citric, acid, is, used, as, a, preservative, in, sauces, and, pickles, carbonic, acid, is, one, of, the, most, common, acid, additives, that, are, widely, added, in, soft, drinks, during, the, manufacturing, process, co, 2, is, usually, pressurized, to, dissolve, in, these, drinks, to, generate, carbonic, acid, carbonic, acid, is, very, unstable, and, tends, to, decompose, into, water, and, co, 2, at, room, temperature, and, pressure, therefore, when, bottles, or, cans, of, these, kinds, of, soft, drinks, are, opened, the, soft, drinks, fizz, and, effervesce, as, co, 2, bubbles, come, out, certain, acids, are, used, as, drugs, acetylsalicylic, acid, aspirin, is, used, as, a, pain, killer, and, for, bringing, down, fevers, acids, play, important, roles, in, the, human, body, the, hydrochloric, acid, present, in, the, stomach, aids, digestion, by, breaking, down, large, and, complex, food, molecules, amino, acids, are, required, for, synthesis, of, proteins, required, for, growth, and, repair, of, body, tissues, fatty, acids, are, also, required, for, growth, and, repair, of, body, tissues, nucleic, acids, are, important, for, the, manufacturing, of, dna, and, rna, and, transmitting, of, traits, to, offspring, through, genes, carbonic, acid, is, important, for, maintenance, of, ph, equilibrium, in, the, body, human, bodies, contain, a, variety, of, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, among, those, dicarboxylic, acids, play, an, essential, role, in, many, biological, behaviors, many, of, those, acids, are, amino, acids, which, mainly, serve, as, materials, for, the, synthesis, of, proteins, other, weak, acids, serve, as, buffers, with, their, conjugate, bases, to, keep, the, body, s, ph, from, undergoing, large, scale, changes, that, would, be, harmful, to, cells, the, rest, of, the, dicarboxylic, acids, also, participate, in, the, synthesis, of, various, biologically, important, compounds, in, human, bodies, acids, are, used, as, catalysts, in, industrial, and, organic, chemistry, for, example, sulfuric, acid, is, used, in, very, large, quantities, in, the, alkylation, process, to, produce, gasoline, some, acids, such, as, sulfuric, phosphoric, and, hydrochloric, acids, also, effect, dehydration, and, condensation, reactions, in, biochemistry, many, enzymes, employ, acid, catalysis, many, biologically, important, molecules, are, acids, nucleic, acids, which, contain, acidic, phosphate, groups, include, dna, and, rna, nucleic, acids, contain, the, genetic, code, that, determines, many, of, an, organism, s, characteristics, and, is, passed, from, parents, to, offspring, dna, contains, the, chemical, blueprint, for, the, synthesis, of, proteins, which, are, made, up, of, amino, acid, subunits, cell, membranes, contain, fatty, acid, esters, such, as, phospholipids, an, amino, acid, has, a, central, carbon, the, or, alpha, carbon, that, is, covalently, bonded, to, a, carboxyl, group, thus, they, are, carboxylic, acids, an, amino, group, a, hydrogen, atom, and, a, variable, group, the, variable, group, also, called, the, r, group, or, side, chain, determines, the, identity, and, many, of, the, properties, of, a, specific, amino, acid, in, glycine, the, simplest, amino, acid, the, r, group, is, a, hydrogen, atom, but, in, all, other, amino, acids, it, is, contains, one, or, more, carbon, atoms, bonded, to, hydrogens, and, may, contain, other, elements, such, as, sulfur, oxygen, or, nitrogen, with, the, exception, of, glycine, naturally, occurring, amino, acids, are, chiral, and, almost, invariably, occur, in, the, l, configuration, peptidoglycan, found, in, some, bacterial, cell, walls, contains, some, d, amino, acids, at, physiological, ph, typically, around, 7, free, amino, acids, exist, in, a, charged, form, where, the, acidic, carboxyl, group, cooh, loses, a, proton, coo, and, the, basic, amine, group, nh, 2, gains, a, proton, nh, 3, the, entire, molecule, has, a, net, neutral, charge, and, is, a, zwitterion, with, the, exception, of, amino, acids, with, basic, or, acidic, side, chains, aspartic, acid, for, example, possesses, one, protonated, amine, and, two, deprotonated, carboxyl, groups, for, a, net, charge, of, 1, at, physiological, ph, fatty, acids, and, fatty, acid, derivatives, are, another, group, of, carboxylic, acids, that, play, a, significant, role, in, biology, these, contain, long, hydrocarbon, chains, and, a, carboxylic, acid, group, on, one, end, the, cell, membrane, of, nearly, all, organisms, is, primarily, made, up, of, a, phospholipid, bilayer, a, micelle, of, hydrophobic, fatty, acid, esters, with, polar, hydrophilic, phosphate, head, groups, membranes, contain, additional, components, some, of, which, can, participate, in, acid, base, reactions, in, humans, and, many, other, animals, hydrochloric, acid, is, a, part, of, the, gastric, acid, secreted, within, the, stomach, to, help, hydrolyze, proteins, and, polysaccharides, as, well, as, converting, the, inactive, pro, enzyme, pepsinogen, into, the, enzyme, pepsin, some, organisms, produce, acids, for, defense, for, example, ants, produce, formic, acid, acid, base, equilibrium, plays, a, critical, role, in, regulating, mammalian, breathing, oxygen, gas, o, 2, drives, cellular, respiration, the, process, by, which, animals, release, the, chemical, potential, energy, stored, in, food, producing, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, as, a, byproduct, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, are, exchanged, in, the, lungs, and, the, body, responds, to, changing, energy, demands, by, adjusting, the, rate, of, ventilation, for, example, during, periods, of, exertion, the, body, rapidly, breaks, down, stored, carbohydrates, and, fat, releasing, co, 2, into, the, blood, stream, in, aqueous, solutions, such, as, blood, co, 2, exists, in, equilibrium, with, carbonic, acid, and, bicarbonate, ion, it, is, the, decrease, in, ph, that, signals, the, brain, to, breathe, faster, and, deeper, expelling, the, excess, co, 2, and, resupplying, the, cells, with, o, 2, cell, membranes, are, generally, impermeable, to, charged, or, large, polar, molecules, because, of, the, lipophilic, fatty, acyl, chains, comprising, their, interior, many, biologically, important, molecules, including, a, number, of, pharmaceutical, agents, are, organic, weak, acids, that, can, cross, the, membrane, in, their, protonated, uncharged, form, but, not, in, their, charged, form, i, e, as, the, conjugate, base, for, this, reason, the, activity, of, many, drugs, can, be, enhanced, or, inhibited, by, the, use, of, antacids, or, acidic, foods, the, charged, form, however, is, often, more, soluble, in, blood, and, cytosol, both, aqueous, environments, when, the, extracellular, environment, is, more, acidic, than, the, neutral, ph, within, the, cell, certain, acids, will, exist, in, their, neutral, form, and, will, be, membrane, soluble, allowing, them, to, cross, the, phospholipid, bilayer, acids, that, lose, a, proton, at, the, intracellular, ph, will, exist, in, their, soluble, charged, form, and, are, thus, able, to, diffuse, through, the, cytosol, to, their, target, ibuprofen, aspirin, and, penicillin, are, examples, of, drugs, that, are, weak, acids, a, sulfonic, acid, has, the, general, formula, rs, o, 2, oh, where, r, is, an, organic, radical, a, carboxylic, acid, has, the, general, formula, r, c, o, oh, where, r, is, an, organic, radical, the, carboxyl, group, c, o, oh, contains, a, carbonyl, group, c, o, and, a, hydroxyl, group, o, h, halogenation, at, alpha, position, increases, acid, strength, so, that, the, following, acids, are, all, stronger, than, acetic, acid, normal, carboxylic, acids, are, the, direct, union, of, a, carbonyl, group, and, a, hydroxyl, group, in, vinylogous, carboxylic, acids, a, carbon, carbon, double, bond, separates, the, carbonyl, and, hydroxyl, groups
