curium, is, a, synthetic, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cm, and, atomic, number, 96, this, transuranic, actinide, element, was, named, after, eminent, scientists, marie, and, pierre, curie, both, known, for, their, research, on, radioactivity, curium, was, first, intentionally, made, by, the, team, of, glenn, t, seaborg, ralph, a, james, and, albert, ghiorso, in, 1944, using, the, cyclotron, at, berkeley, they, bombarded, the, newly, discovered, element, plutonium, the, isotope, 239, pu, with, alpha, particles, this, was, then, sent, to, the, metallurgical, laboratory, at, university, of, chicago, where, a, tiny, sample, of, curium, was, eventually, separated, and, identified, the, discovery, was, kept, secret, until, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, news, was, released, to, the, public, in, november, 1947, most, curium, is, produced, by, bombarding, uranium, or, plutonium, with, neutrons, in, nuclear, reactors, one, tonne, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, contains, 20, grams, of, curium, curium, is, a, hard, dense, silvery, metal, with, a, high, melting, and, boiling, point, for, an, actinide, it, is, paramagnetic, at, ambient, conditions, but, becomes, antiferromagnetic, upon, cooling, and, other, magnetic, transitions, are, also, seen, in, many, curium, compounds, in, compounds, curium, usually, has, valence, 3, and, sometimes, 4, the, 3, valence, is, predominant, in, solutions, curium, readily, oxidizes, and, its, oxides, are, a, dominant, form, of, this, element, it, forms, strongly, fluorescent, complexes, with, various, organic, compounds, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, its, incorporation, into, bacteria, and, archaea, if, it, gets, into, the, human, body, curium, accumulates, in, bones, lungs, and, liver, where, it, promotes, cancer, all, known, isotopes, of, curium, are, radioactive, and, have, small, critical, mass, for, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, the, most, stable, isotope, 247, cm, has, a, half, life, of, 15, 6, million, years, the, longest, lived, curium, isotopes, predominantly, emit, alpha, particles, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, can, use, the, heat, from, this, process, but, this, is, hindered, by, the, rarity, and, high, cost, of, curium, curium, is, used, in, making, heavier, actinides, and, the, 238, pu, radionuclide, for, power, sources, in, artificial, cardiac, pacemakers, and, rtgs, for, spacecraft, it, served, as, the, source, in, the, alpha, particle, x, ray, spectrometers, of, several, space, probes, including, the, sojourner, spirit, opportunity, and, curiosity, mars, rovers, and, the, philae, lander, on, comet, 67p, churyumov, gerasimenko, to, analyze, the, composition, and, structure, of, the, surface, researchers, have, proposed, using, curium, as, fuel, in, nuclear, reactors, though, curium, had, likely, been, produced, in, previous, nuclear, experiments, as, well, as, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, at, oklo, gabon, it, was, first, intentionally, synthesized, isolated, and, identified, in, 1944, at, university, of, california, berkeley, by, glenn, t, seaborg, ralph, a, james, and, albert, ghiorso, in, their, experiments, they, used, a, 60, inch, 150, cm, cyclotron, curium, was, chemically, identified, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, now, argonne, national, laboratory, university, of, chicago, it, was, the, third, transuranium, element, to, be, discovered, even, though, it, is, the, fourth, in, the, series, the, lighter, element, americium, was, still, unknown, the, sample, was, prepared, as, follows, first, plutonium, nitrate, solution, was, coated, on, a, platinum, foil, of, 0, 5, cm, 2, area, the, solution, was, evaporated, and, the, residue, was, converted, into, plutonium, iv, oxide, puo, 2, by, annealing, following, cyclotron, irradiation, of, the, oxide, the, coating, was, dissolved, with, nitric, acid, and, then, precipitated, as, the, hydroxide, using, concentrated, aqueous, ammonia, solution, the, residue, was, dissolved, in, perchloric, acid, and, further, separation, was, done, by, ion, exchange, to, yield, a, certain, isotope, of, curium, the, separation, of, curium, and, americium, was, so, painstaking, that, the, berkeley, group, initially, called, those, elements, pandemonium, from, greek, for, all, demons, or, hell, and, delirium, from, latin, for, madness, curium, 242, was, made, in, july, august, 1944, by, bombarding, 239, pu, with, particles, to, produce, curium, with, the, release, of, a, neutron, curium, 242, was, unambiguously, identified, by, the, characteristic, energy, of, the, particles, emitted, during, the, decay, the, half, life, of, this, alpha, decay, was, first, measured, as, 150, days, and, then, corrected, to, 162, 8, days, another, isotope, 240, cm, was, produced, in, a, similar, reaction, in, march, 1945, the, decay, half, life, of, 240, cm, was, correctly, determined, as, 26, 7, days, the, discovery, of, curium, and, americium, in, 1944, was, closely, related, to, the, manhattan, project, so, the, results, were, confidential, and, declassified, only, in, 1945, seaborg, leaked, the, synthesis, of, the, elements, 95, and, 96, on, the, u, s, radio, show, for, children, the, quiz, kids, five, days, before, the, official, presentation, at, an, american, chemical, society, meeting, on, november, 11, 1945, when, one, listener, asked, if, any, new, transuranic, element, beside, plutonium, and, neptunium, had, been, discovered, during, the, war, the, discovery, of, curium, 242, cm, and, 240, cm, its, production, and, its, compounds, was, later, patented, listing, only, seaborg, as, the, inventor, the, element, was, named, after, marie, curie, and, her, husband, pierre, curie, who, are, known, for, discovering, radium, and, for, their, work, in, radioactivity, it, followed, the, example, of, gadolinium, a, lanthanide, element, above, curium, in, the, periodic, table, which, was, named, after, the, explorer, of, rare, earth, elements, johan, gadolin, as, the, name, for, the, element, of, atomic, number, 96, we, should, like, to, propose, curium, with, symbol, cm, the, evidence, indicates, that, element, 96, contains, seven, 5f, electrons, and, is, thus, analogous, to, the, element, gadolinium, with, its, seven, 4f, electrons, in, the, regular, rare, earth, series, on, this, basis, element, 96, is, named, after, the, curies, in, a, manner, analogous, to, the, naming, of, gadolinium, in, which, the, chemist, gadolin, was, honored, the, first, curium, samples, were, barely, visible, and, were, identified, by, their, radioactivity, louis, werner, and, isadore, perlman, made, the, first, substantial, sample, of, 30, g, curium, 242, hydroxide, at, university, of, california, berkeley, in, 1947, by, bombarding, americium, 241, with, neutrons, macroscopic, amounts, of, curium, iii, fluoride, were, obtained, in, 1950, by, w, w, t, crane, j, c, wallmann, and, b, b, cunningham, its, magnetic, susceptibility, was, very, close, to, that, of, gdf, 3, providing, the, first, experimental, evidence, for, the, 3, valence, of, curium, in, its, compounds, curium, metal, was, produced, only, in, 1951, by, reduction, of, cmf, 3, with, barium, a, synthetic, radioactive, element, curium, is, a, hard, dense, metal, with, a, silvery, white, appearance, and, physical, and, chemical, properties, resembling, gadolinium, its, melting, point, of, 1344, c, is, significantly, higher, than, that, of, the, previous, elements, neptunium, 637, c, plutonium, 639, c, and, americium, 1176, c, in, comparison, gadolinium, melts, at, 1312, c, curium, boils, at, 3556, c, with, a, density, of, 13, 52, g, cm, 3, curium, is, lighter, than, neptunium, 20, 45, g, cm, 3, and, plutonium, 19, 8, g, cm, 3, but, heavier, than, most, other, metals, of, two, crystalline, forms, of, curium, cm, is, more, stable, at, ambient, conditions, it, has, a, hexagonal, symmetry, space, group, p6, 3, mmc, lattice, parameters, a, 365, pm, and, c, 1182, pm, and, four, formula, units, per, unit, cell, the, crystal, consists, of, double, hexagonal, close, packing, with, the, layer, sequence, abac, and, so, is, isotypic, with, lanthanum, at, pressure, 23, gpa, at, room, temperature, cm, becomes, cm, which, has, face, centered, cubic, symmetry, space, group, fm, 3, m, and, lattice, constant, a, 493, pm, on, further, compression, to, 43, gpa, curium, becomes, an, orthorhombic, cm, structure, similar, to, uranium, with, no, further, transitions, observed, up, to, 52, gpa, these, three, curium, phases, are, also, called, cm, i, ii, and, iii, curium, has, peculiar, magnetic, properties, its, neighbor, element, americium, shows, no, deviation, from, curie, weiss, paramagnetism, in, the, entire, temperature, range, but, cm, transforms, to, an, antiferromagnetic, state, upon, cooling, to, 65, 52, k, and, cm, exhibits, a, ferrimagnetic, transition, at, 205, k, curium, pnictides, show, ferromagnetic, transitions, upon, cooling, 244, cmn, and, 244, cmas, at, 109, k, 248, cmp, at, 73, k, and, 248, cmsb, at, 162, k, the, lanthanide, analog, of, curium, gadolinium, and, its, pnictides, also, show, magnetic, transitions, upon, cooling, but, the, transition, character, is, somewhat, different, gd, and, gdn, become, ferromagnetic, and, gdp, gdas, and, gdsb, show, antiferromagnetic, ordering, in, accordance, with, magnetic, data, electrical, resistivity, of, curium, increases, with, temperature, about, twice, between, 4, and, 60, k, and, then, is, nearly, constant, up, to, room, temperature, there, is, a, significant, increase, in, resistivity, over, time, 10, cm, h, due, to, self, damage, of, the, crystal, lattice, by, alpha, decay, this, makes, uncertain, the, true, resistivity, of, curium, 125, cm, curium, s, resistivity, is, similar, to, that, of, gadolinium, and, the, actinides, plutonium, and, neptunium, but, significantly, higher, than, that, of, americium, uranium, polonium, and, thorium, under, ultraviolet, illumination, curium, iii, ions, show, strong, and, stable, yellow, orange, fluorescence, with, a, maximum, in, the, range, of, 590, 640, nm, depending, on, their, environment, the, fluorescence, originates, from, the, transitions, from, the, first, excited, state, 6, d, 7, 2, and, the, ground, state, 8, s, 7, 2, analysis, of, this, fluorescence, allows, monitoring, interactions, between, cm, iii, ions, in, organic, and, inorganic, complexes, curium, ion, in, solution, almost, always, has, a, 3, oxidation, state, the, most, stable, oxidation, state, for, curium, a, 4, oxidation, state, is, seen, mainly, in, a, few, solid, phases, such, as, cmo, 2, and, cmf, 4, aqueous, curium, iv, is, only, known, in, the, presence, of, strong, oxidizers, such, as, potassium, persulfate, and, is, easily, reduced, to, curium, iii, by, radiolysis, and, even, by, water, itself, chemical, behavior, of, curium, is, different, from, the, actinides, thorium, and, uranium, and, is, similar, to, americium, and, many, lanthanides, in, aqueous, solution, the, cm, 3, ion, is, colorless, to, pale, green, cm, 4, ion, is, pale, yellow, the, optical, absorption, of, cm, 3, ion, contains, three, sharp, peaks, at, 375, 4, 381, 2, and, 396, 5, nm, and, their, strength, can, be, directly, converted, into, the, concentration, of, the, ions, the, 6, oxidation, state, has, only, been, reported, once, in, solution, in, 1978, as, the, curyl, ion, cmo, 2, 2, this, was, prepared, from, beta, decay, of, americium, 242, in, the, americium, v, ion, 242, amo, 2, failure, to, get, cm, vi, from, oxidation, of, cm, iii, and, cm, iv, may, be, due, to, the, high, cm, 4, cm, 3, ionization, potential, and, the, instability, of, cm, v, curium, ions, are, hard, lewis, acids, and, thus, form, most, stable, complexes, with, hard, bases, the, bonding, is, mostly, ionic, with, a, small, covalent, component, curium, in, its, complexes, commonly, exhibits, a, 9, fold, coordination, environment, with, a, tricapped, trigonal, prismatic, molecular, geometry, about, 19, radioisotopes, and, 7, nuclear, isomers, 233, cm, to, 251, cm, are, known, none, are, stable, the, longest, half, lives, are, 15, 6, million, years, 247, cm, and, 348, 000, years, 248, cm, other, long, lived, ones, are, 245, cm, 8500, years, 250, cm, 8300, years, and, 246, cm, 4760, years, curium, 250, is, unusual, it, mostly, 86, decays, by, spontaneous, fission, the, most, commonly, used, isotopes, are, 242, cm, and, 244, cm, with, the, half, lives, 162, 8, days, and, 18, 1, years, respectively, all, isotopes, ranging, from, 242, cm, to, 248, cm, as, well, as, 250, cm, undergo, a, self, sustaining, nuclear, chain, reaction, and, thus, in, principle, can, be, a, nuclear, fuel, in, a, reactor, as, in, most, transuranic, elements, nuclear, fission, cross, section, is, especially, high, for, the, odd, mass, curium, isotopes, 243, cm, 245, cm, and, 247, cm, these, can, be, used, in, thermal, neutron, reactors, whereas, a, mixture, of, curium, isotopes, is, only, suitable, for, fast, breeder, reactors, since, the, even, mass, isotopes, are, not, fissile, in, a, thermal, reactor, and, accumulate, as, burn, up, increases, the, mixed, oxide, mox, fuel, which, is, to, be, used, in, power, reactors, should, contain, little, or, no, curium, because, neutron, activation, of, 248, cm, will, create, californium, californium, is, a, strong, neutron, emitter, and, would, pollute, the, back, end, of, the, fuel, cycle, and, increase, the, dose, to, reactor, personnel, hence, if, minor, actinides, are, to, be, used, as, fuel, in, a, thermal, neutron, reactor, the, curium, should, be, excluded, from, the, fuel, or, placed, in, special, fuel, rods, where, it, is, the, only, actinide, present, the, adjacent, table, lists, the, critical, masses, for, curium, isotopes, for, a, sphere, without, moderator, or, reflector, with, a, metal, reflector, 30, cm, of, steel, the, critical, masses, of, the, odd, isotopes, are, about, 3, 4, kg, when, using, water, thickness, 20, 30, cm, as, the, reflector, the, critical, mass, can, be, as, small, as, 59, grams, for, 245, cm, 155, grams, for, 243, cm, and, 1550, grams, for, 247, cm, there, is, significant, uncertainty, in, these, critical, mass, values, while, it, is, usually, on, the, order, of, 20, the, values, for, 242, cm, and, 246, cm, were, listed, as, large, as, 371, kg, and, 70, 1, kg, respectively, by, some, research, groups, curium, is, not, currently, used, as, nuclear, fuel, due, to, its, low, availability, and, high, price, 245, cm, and, 247, cm, have, very, small, critical, mass, and, so, could, be, used, in, tactical, nuclear, weapons, but, none, are, known, to, have, been, made, curium, 243, is, not, suitable, for, such, due, to, its, short, half, life, and, strong, emission, which, would, cause, excessive, heat, curium, 247, would, be, highly, suitable, due, to, its, long, half, life, which, is, 647, times, longer, than, plutonium, 239, used, in, many, existing, nuclear, weapons, the, longest, lived, isotope, 247, cm, has, half, life, 15, 6, million, years, so, any, primordial, curium, that, is, present, on, earth, when, it, formed, should, have, decayed, by, now, its, past, presence, as, an, extinct, radionuclide, is, detectable, as, an, excess, of, its, primordial, long, lived, daughter, 235, u, traces, of, 242, cm, may, occur, naturally, in, uranium, minerals, due, to, neutron, capture, and, beta, decay, 238, u, 239, pu, 240, pu, 241, am, 242, cm, though, the, quantities, would, be, tiny, and, this, has, not, been, confirmed, even, with, extremely, generous, estimates, for, neutron, absorption, possibilities, the, quantity, of, 242, cm, present, in, 1, 10, 8, kg, of, 18, uranium, pitchblende, would, not, even, be, one, atom, traces, of, 247, cm, are, also, probably, brought, to, earth, in, cosmic, rays, but, this, also, has, not, been, confirmed, there, is, also, the, possibility, of, 244, cm, being, produced, as, the, double, beta, decay, daughter, of, natural, 244, pu, curium, is, made, artificially, in, small, amounts, for, research, purposes, it, also, occurs, as, one, of, the, waste, products, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, curium, is, present, in, nature, in, some, areas, used, for, nuclear, weapons, testing, analysis, of, the, debris, at, the, test, site, of, the, united, states, first, thermonuclear, weapon, ivy, mike, 1, november, 1952, enewetak, atoll, besides, einsteinium, fermium, plutonium, and, americium, also, revealed, isotopes, of, berkelium, californium, and, curium, in, particular, 245, cm, 246, cm, and, smaller, quantities, of, 247, cm, 248, cm, and, 249, cm, atmospheric, curium, compounds, are, poorly, soluble, in, common, solvents, and, mostly, adhere, to, soil, particles, soil, analysis, revealed, about, 4, 000, times, higher, concentration, of, curium, at, the, sandy, soil, particles, than, in, water, present, in, the, soil, pores, an, even, higher, ratio, of, about, 18, 000, was, measured, in, loam, soils, the, transuranium, elements, from, americium, to, fermium, including, curium, occurred, naturally, in, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, at, oklo, but, no, longer, do, so, curium, and, other, non, primordial, actinides, have, also, been, suspected, to, exist, in, the, spectrum, of, przybylski, s, star, curium, is, made, in, small, amounts, in, nuclear, reactors, and, by, now, only, kilograms, of, 242, cm, and, 244, cm, have, been, accumulated, and, grams, or, even, milligrams, for, heavier, isotopes, hence, the, high, price, of, curium, which, has, been, quoted, at, 160, 185, usd, per, milligram, with, a, more, recent, estimate, at, us, 2, 000, g, for, 242, cm, and, us, 170, g, for, 244, cm, in, nuclear, reactors, curium, is, formed, from, 238, u, in, a, series, of, nuclear, reactions, in, the, first, chain, 238, u, captures, a, neutron, and, converts, into, 239, u, which, via, decay, transforms, into, 239, np, and, 239, pu, further, neutron, capture, followed, by, decay, gives, americium, 241, am, which, further, becomes, 242, cm, for, research, purposes, curium, is, obtained, by, irradiating, not, uranium, but, plutonium, which, is, available, in, large, amounts, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, a, much, higher, neutron, flux, is, used, for, the, irradiation, that, results, in, a, different, reaction, chain, and, formation, of, 244, cm, curium, 244, alpha, decays, to, 240, pu, but, it, also, absorbs, neutrons, hence, a, small, amount, of, heavier, curium, isotopes, of, those, 247, cm, and, 248, cm, are, popular, in, scientific, research, due, to, their, long, half, lives, but, the, production, rate, of, 247, cm, in, thermal, neutron, reactors, is, low, because, it, is, prone, to, fission, due, to, thermal, neutrons, synthesis, of, 250, cm, by, neutron, capture, is, unlikely, due, to, the, short, half, life, of, the, intermediate, 249, cm, 64, min, which, decays, to, the, berkelium, isotope, 249, bk, the, above, cascade, of, n, reactions, gives, a, mix, of, different, curium, isotopes, their, post, synthesis, separation, is, cumbersome, so, a, selective, synthesis, is, desired, curium, 248, is, favored, for, research, purposes, due, to, its, long, half, life, the, most, efficient, way, to, prepare, this, isotope, is, by, decay, of, the, californium, isotope, 252, cf, which, is, available, in, relatively, large, amounts, due, to, its, long, half, life, 2, 65, years, about, 35, 50, mg, of, 248, cm, is, produced, thus, per, year, the, associated, reaction, produces, 248, cm, with, isotopic, purity, of, 97, another, isotope, 245, cm, can, be, obtained, for, research, from, decay, of, 249, cf, the, latter, isotope, is, produced, in, small, amounts, from, decay, of, 249, bk, most, synthesis, routines, yield, a, mix, of, actinide, isotopes, as, oxides, from, which, a, given, isotope, of, curium, needs, to, be, separated, an, example, procedure, could, be, to, dissolve, spent, reactor, fuel, e, g, mox, fuel, in, nitric, acid, and, remove, the, bulk, of, the, uranium, and, plutonium, using, a, purex, p, lutonium, ur, anium, ex, traction, type, extraction, with, tributyl, phosphate, in, a, hydrocarbon, the, lanthanides, and, the, remaining, actinides, are, then, separated, from, the, aqueous, residue, raffinate, by, a, diamide, based, extraction, to, give, after, stripping, a, mixture, of, trivalent, actinides, and, lanthanides, a, curium, compound, is, then, selectively, extracted, using, multi, step, chromatographic, and, centrifugation, techniques, with, an, appropriate, reagent, bis, triazinyl, bipyridine, complex, has, been, recently, proposed, as, such, reagent, which, is, highly, selective, to, curium, separation, of, curium, from, the, very, chemically, similar, americium, can, also, be, done, by, treating, a, slurry, of, their, hydroxides, in, aqueous, sodium, bicarbonate, with, ozone, at, elevated, temperature, both, americium, and, curium, are, present, in, solutions, mostly, in, the, 3, valence, state, americium, oxidizes, to, soluble, am, iv, complexes, but, curium, stays, unchanged, and, so, can, be, isolated, by, repeated, centrifugation, metallic, curium, is, obtained, by, reduction, of, its, compounds, initially, curium, iii, fluoride, was, used, for, this, purpose, the, reaction, was, done, in, an, environment, free, of, water, and, oxygen, in, an, apparatus, made, of, tantalum, and, tungsten, using, elemental, barium, or, lithium, as, reducing, agents, another, possibility, is, reduction, of, curium, iv, oxide, using, a, magnesium, zinc, alloy, in, a, melt, of, magnesium, chloride, and, magnesium, fluoride, curium, readily, reacts, with, oxygen, forming, mostly, cm, 2, o, 3, and, cmo, 2, oxides, but, the, divalent, oxide, cmo, is, also, known, black, cmo, 2, can, be, obtained, by, burning, curium, oxalate, cm, 2, c, 2, o, 4, 3, nitrate, cm, no, 3, 3, or, hydroxide, in, pure, oxygen, upon, heating, to, 600, 650, c, in, vacuum, about, 0, 01, pa, it, transforms, into, the, whitish, cm, 2, o, 3, or, cm, 2, o, 3, can, be, obtained, by, reducing, cmo, 2, with, molecular, hydrogen, also, a, number, of, ternary, oxides, of, the, type, m, ii, cmo, 3, are, known, where, m, stands, for, a, divalent, metal, such, as, barium, thermal, oxidation, of, trace, quantities, of, curium, hydride, cmh, 2, 3, has, been, reported, to, give, a, volatile, form, of, cmo, 2, and, the, volatile, trioxide, cmo, 3, one, of, two, known, examples, of, the, very, rare, 6, state, for, curium, another, observed, species, was, reported, to, behave, similar, to, a, supposed, plutonium, tetroxide, and, was, tentatively, characterized, as, cmo, 4, with, curium, in, the, extremely, rare, 8, state, but, new, experiments, seem, to, indicate, that, cmo, 4, does, not, exist, and, have, cast, doubt, on, the, existence, of, puo, 4, as, well, the, colorless, curium, iii, fluoride, cmf, 3, can, be, made, by, adding, fluoride, ions, into, curium, iii, containing, solutions, the, brown, tetravalent, curium, iv, fluoride, cmf, 4, on, the, other, hand, is, only, obtained, by, reacting, curium, iii, fluoride, with, molecular, fluorine, a, series, of, ternary, fluorides, are, known, of, the, form, a, 7, cm, 6, f, 31, a, alkali, metal, the, colorless, curium, iii, chloride, cmcl, 3, is, made, by, reacting, curium, hydroxide, cm, oh, 3, with, anhydrous, hydrogen, chloride, gas, it, can, be, further, turned, into, other, halides, such, as, curium, iii, bromide, colorless, to, light, green, and, curium, iii, iodide, colorless, by, reacting, it, with, the, ammonia, salt, of, the, corresponding, halide, at, temperatures, of, 400, 450, c, or, one, can, heat, curium, oxide, to, 600, c, with, the, corresponding, acid, such, as, hydrobromic, for, curium, bromide, vapor, phase, hydrolysis, of, curium, iii, chloride, gives, curium, oxychloride, sulfides, selenides, and, tellurides, of, curium, have, been, obtained, by, treating, curium, with, gaseous, sulfur, selenium, or, tellurium, in, vacuum, at, elevated, temperature, curium, pnictides, of, the, type, cmx, are, known, for, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, and, antimony, they, can, be, prepared, by, reacting, either, curium, iii, hydride, cmh, 3, or, metallic, curium, with, these, elements, at, elevated, temperature, organometallic, complexes, analogous, to, uranocene, are, known, also, for, other, actinides, such, as, thorium, protactinium, neptunium, plutonium, and, americium, molecular, orbital, theory, predicts, a, stable, curocene, complex, 8, c, 8, h, 8, 2, cm, but, it, has, not, been, reported, experimentally, yet, formation, of, the, complexes, of, the, type, cm, n, c, 3, h, 7, btp, 3, btp, 2, 6, di, 1, 2, 4, triazin, 3, yl, pyridine, in, solutions, containing, n, c, 3, h, 7, btp, and, cm, 3, ions, has, been, confirmed, by, exafs, some, of, these, btp, type, complexes, selectively, interact, with, curium, and, thus, are, useful, for, separating, it, from, lanthanides, and, another, actinides, dissolved, cm, 3, ions, bind, with, many, organic, compounds, such, as, hydroxamic, acid, urea, fluorescein, and, adenosine, triphosphate, many, of, these, compounds, are, related, to, biological, activity, of, various, microorganisms, the, resulting, complexes, show, strong, yellow, orange, emission, under, uv, light, excitation, which, is, convenient, not, only, for, their, detection, but, also, for, studying, interactions, between, the, cm, 3, ion, and, the, ligands, via, changes, in, the, half, life, of, the, order, 0, 1, ms, and, spectrum, of, the, fluorescence, curium, has, no, biological, significance, there, are, a, few, reports, on, biosorption, of, cm, 3, by, bacteria, and, archaea, but, no, evidence, for, incorporation, of, curium, into, them, curium, is, one, of, the, most, radioactive, isolable, elements, its, two, most, common, isotopes, 242, cm, and, 244, cm, are, strong, alpha, emitters, energy, 6, mev, they, have, fairly, short, half, lives, 162, 8, days, and, 18, 1, years, and, give, as, much, as, 120, w, g, and, 3, w, g, of, heat, respectively, therefore, curium, can, be, used, in, its, common, oxide, form, in, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, like, those, in, spacecraft, this, application, has, been, studied, for, the, 244, cm, isotope, while, 242, cm, was, abandoned, due, to, its, prohibitive, price, around, 2000, usd, g, 243, cm, with, a, 30, year, half, life, and, good, energy, yield, of, 1, 6, w, g, could, be, a, suitable, fuel, but, it, gives, significant, amounts, of, harmful, gamma, and, beta, rays, from, radioactive, decay, products, as, an, emitter, 244, cm, needs, much, less, radiation, shielding, but, it, has, a, high, spontaneous, fission, rate, and, thus, a, lot, of, neutron, and, gamma, radiation, compared, to, a, competing, thermoelectric, generator, isotope, such, as, 238, pu, 244, cm, emits, 500, times, more, neutrons, and, its, higher, gamma, emission, requires, a, shield, that, is, 20, times, thicker, 2, inches, 51, mm, of, lead, for, a, 1, kw, source, compared, to, 0, 1, inches, 2, 5, mm, for, 238, pu, therefore, this, use, of, curium, is, currently, considered, impractical, a, more, promising, use, of, 242, cm, is, for, making, 238, pu, a, better, radioisotope, for, thermoelectric, generators, such, as, in, heart, pacemakers, the, alternate, routes, to, 238, pu, use, the, n, reaction, of, 237, np, or, deuteron, bombardment, of, uranium, though, both, reactions, always, produce, 236, pu, as, an, undesired, by, product, since, the, latter, decays, to, 232, u, with, strong, gamma, emission, curium, is, a, common, starting, material, for, making, higher, transuranic, and, superheavy, elements, thus, bombarding, 248, cm, with, neon, 22, ne, magnesium, 26, mg, or, calcium, 48, ca, yields, isotopes, of, seaborgium, 265, sg, hassium, 269, hs, and, 270, hs, and, livermorium, 292, lv, 293, lv, and, possibly, 294, lv, californium, was, discovered, when, a, microgram, sized, target, of, curium, 242, was, irradiated, with, 35, mev, alpha, particles, using, the, 60, inch, 150, cm, cyclotron, at, berkeley, only, about, 5, 000, atoms, of, californium, were, produced, in, this, experiment, the, odd, mass, curium, isotopes, 243, cm, 245, cm, and, 247, cm, are, all, highly, fissile, and, can, release, additional, energy, in, a, thermal, spectrum, nuclear, reactor, all, curium, isotopes, are, fissionable, in, fast, neutron, reactors, this, is, one, of, the, motives, for, minor, actinide, separation, and, transmutation, in, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, helping, to, reduce, the, long, term, radiotoxicity, of, used, or, spent, nuclear, fuel, the, most, practical, application, of, 244, cm, though, rather, limited, in, total, volume, is, as, particle, source, in, alpha, particle, x, ray, spectrometers, apxs, these, instruments, were, installed, on, the, sojourner, mars, mars, 96, mars, exploration, rovers, and, philae, comet, lander, as, well, as, the, mars, science, laboratory, to, analyze, the, composition, and, structure, of, the, rocks, on, the, surface, of, planet, mars, apxs, was, also, used, in, the, surveyor, 5, 7, moon, probes, but, with, a, 242, cm, source, an, elaborate, apxs, setup, has, a, sensor, head, containing, six, curium, sources, with, a, total, decay, rate, of, several, tens, of, millicuries, roughly, one, gigabecquerel, the, sources, are, collimated, on, a, sample, and, the, energy, spectra, of, the, alpha, particles, and, protons, scattered, from, the, sample, are, analyzed, proton, analysis, is, done, only, in, some, spectrometers, these, spectra, contain, quantitative, information, on, all, major, elements, in, the, sample, except, for, hydrogen, helium, and, lithium, due, to, its, radioactivity, curium, and, its, compounds, must, be, handled, in, appropriate, labs, under, special, arrangements, while, curium, itself, mostly, emits, particles, which, are, absorbed, by, thin, layers, of, common, materials, some, of, its, decay, products, emit, significant, fractions, of, beta, and, gamma, rays, which, require, a, more, elaborate, protection, if, consumed, curium, is, excreted, within, a, few, days, and, only, 0, 05, is, absorbed, in, the, blood, from, there, 45, goes, to, the, liver, 45, to, the, bones, and, the, remaining, 10, is, excreted, in, bone, curium, accumulates, on, the, inside, of, the, interfaces, to, the, bone, marrow, and, does, not, significantly, redistribute, with, time, its, radiation, destroys, bone, marrow, and, thus, stops, red, blood, cell, creation, the, biological, half, life, of, curium, is, about, 20, years, in, the, liver, and, 50, years, in, the, bones, curium, is, absorbed, in, the, body, much, more, strongly, via, inhalation, and, the, allowed, total, dose, of, 244, cm, in, soluble, form, is, 0, 3, ci, intravenous, injection, of, 242, cm, and, 244, cm, containing, solutions, to, rats, increased, the, incidence, of, bone, tumor, and, inhalation, promoted, lung, and, liver, cancer, curium, isotopes, are, inevitably, present, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, about, 20, g, tonne, the, isotopes, 245, cm, 248, cm, have, decay, times, of, thousands, of, years, and, must, be, removed, to, neutralize, the, fuel, for, disposal, such, a, procedure, involves, several, steps, where, curium, is, first, separated, and, then, converted, by, neutron, bombardment, in, special, reactors, to, short, lived, nuclides, this, procedure, nuclear, transmutation, while, well, documented, for, other, elements, is, still, being, developed, for, curium
