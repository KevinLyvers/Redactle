parallax, is, a, displacement, or, difference, in, the, apparent, position, of, an, object, viewed, along, two, different, lines, of, sight, and, is, measured, by, the, angle, or, half, angle, of, inclination, between, those, two, lines, due, to, foreshortening, nearby, objects, show, a, larger, parallax, than, farther, objects, so, parallax, can, be, used, to, determine, distances, to, measure, large, distances, such, as, the, distance, of, a, planet, or, a, star, from, earth, astronomers, use, the, principle, of, parallax, here, the, term, parallax, is, the, semi, angle, of, inclination, between, two, sight, lines, to, the, star, as, observed, when, earth, is, on, opposite, sides, of, the, sun, in, its, orbit, these, distances, form, the, lowest, rung, of, what, is, called, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, the, first, in, a, succession, of, methods, by, which, astronomers, determine, the, distances, to, celestial, objects, serving, as, a, basis, for, other, distance, measurements, in, astronomy, forming, the, higher, rungs, of, the, ladder, parallax, also, affects, optical, instruments, such, as, rifle, scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and, twin, lens, reflex, cameras, that, view, objects, from, slightly, different, angles, many, animals, along, with, humans, have, two, eyes, with, overlapping, visual, fields, that, use, parallax, to, gain, depth, perception, this, process, is, known, as, stereopsis, in, computer, vision, the, effect, is, used, for, computer, stereo, vision, and, there, is, a, device, called, a, parallax, rangefinder, that, uses, it, to, find, the, range, and, in, some, variations, also, altitude, to, a, target, a, simple, everyday, example, of, parallax, can, be, seen, in, the, dashboards, of, motor, vehicles, that, use, a, needle, style, mechanical, speedometer, when, viewed, from, directly, in, front, the, speed, may, show, exactly, 60, but, when, viewed, from, the, passenger, seat, the, needle, may, appear, to, show, a, slightly, different, speed, due, to, the, angle, of, viewing, combined, with, the, displacement, of, the, needle, from, the, plane, of, the, numerical, dial, because, the, eyes, of, humans, and, other, animals, are, in, different, positions, on, the, head, they, present, different, views, simultaneously, this, is, the, basis, of, stereopsis, the, process, by, which, the, brain, exploits, the, parallax, due, to, the, different, views, from, the, eye, to, gain, depth, perception, and, estimate, distances, to, objects, animals, also, use, motion, parallax, in, which, the, animals, or, just, the, head, move, to, gain, different, viewpoints, for, example, pigeons, whose, eyes, do, not, have, overlapping, fields, of, view, and, thus, cannot, use, stereopsis, bob, their, heads, up, and, down, to, see, depth, the, motion, parallax, is, exploited, also, in, wiggle, stereoscopy, computer, graphics, that, provide, depth, cues, through, viewpoint, shifting, animation, rather, than, through, binocular, vision, parallax, arises, due, to, a, change, in, viewpoint, occurring, due, to, the, motion, of, the, observer, of, the, observed, or, both, what, is, essential, is, relative, motion, by, observing, parallax, measuring, angles, and, using, geometry, one, can, determine, distance, distance, measurement, by, parallax, is, a, special, case, of, the, principle, of, triangulation, which, states, that, one, can, solve, for, all, the, sides, and, angles, in, a, network, of, triangles, if, in, addition, to, all, the, angles, in, the, network, the, length, of, at, least, one, side, has, been, measured, thus, the, careful, measurement, of, the, length, of, one, baseline, can, fix, the, scale, of, an, entire, triangulation, network, in, parallax, the, triangle, is, extremely, long, and, narrow, and, by, measuring, both, its, shortest, side, the, motion, of, the, observer, and, the, small, top, angle, always, less, than, 1, arcsecond, leaving, the, other, two, close, to, 90, degrees, the, length, of, the, long, sides, in, practice, considered, to, be, equal, can, be, determined, in, astronomy, assuming, the, angle, is, small, the, distance, to, a, star, measured, in, parsecs, is, the, reciprocal, of, the, parallax, measured, in, arcseconds, d, p, c, 1, p, a, r, c, s, e, c, displaystyle, d, mathrm, pc, 1, p, mathrm, arcsec, for, example, the, distance, to, proxima, centauri, is, 1, 0, 7687, 1, 3009, parsecs, 4, 243, ly, on, earth, a, coincidence, rangefinder, or, parallax, rangefinder, can, be, used, to, find, distance, to, a, target, in, surveying, the, problem, of, resection, explores, angular, measurements, from, a, known, baseline, for, determining, an, unknown, point, s, coordinates, the, most, important, fundamental, distance, measurements, in, astronomy, come, from, trigonometric, parallax, as, applied, in, the, stellar, parallax, method, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, the, position, of, nearby, stars, will, appear, to, shift, slightly, against, the, more, distant, background, these, shifts, are, angles, in, an, isosceles, triangle, with, 2, au, the, distance, between, the, extreme, positions, of, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, making, the, base, leg, of, the, triangle, and, the, distance, to, the, star, being, the, long, equal, length, legs, the, amount, of, shift, is, quite, small, even, for, the, nearest, stars, measuring, 1, arcsecond, for, an, object, at, 1, parsec, s, distance, 3, 26, light, years, and, thereafter, decreasing, in, angular, amount, as, the, distance, increases, astronomers, usually, express, distances, in, units, of, parsecs, parallax, arcseconds, light, years, are, used, in, popular, media, because, parallax, becomes, smaller, for, a, greater, stellar, distance, useful, distances, can, be, measured, only, for, stars, which, are, near, enough, to, have, a, parallax, larger, than, a, few, times, the, precision, of, the, measurement, in, the, 1990s, for, example, the, hipparcos, mission, obtained, parallaxes, for, over, a, hundred, thousand, stars, with, a, precision, of, about, a, milliarcsecond, providing, useful, distances, for, stars, out, to, a, few, hundred, parsecs, the, hubble, space, telescope, s, wide, field, camera, 3, has, the, potential, to, provide, a, precision, of, 20, to, 40, micro, arcseconds, enabling, reliable, distance, measurements, up, to, 5, 000, parsecs, 16, 000, ly, for, small, numbers, of, stars, the, gaia, space, mission, provided, similarly, accurate, distances, to, most, stars, brighter, than, 15th, magnitude, distances, can, be, measured, within, 10, as, far, as, the, galactic, center, about, 30, 000, light, years, away, stars, have, a, velocity, relative, to, the, sun, that, causes, proper, motion, transverse, across, the, sky, and, radial, velocity, motion, toward, or, away, from, the, sun, the, former, is, determined, by, plotting, the, changing, position, of, the, stars, over, many, years, while, the, latter, comes, from, measuring, the, doppler, shift, of, the, star, s, spectrum, caused, by, motion, along, the, line, of, sight, for, a, group, of, stars, with, the, same, spectral, class, and, a, similar, magnitude, range, a, mean, parallax, can, be, derived, from, statistical, analysis, of, the, proper, motions, relative, to, their, radial, velocities, this, statistical, parallax, method, is, useful, for, measuring, the, distances, of, bright, stars, beyond, 50, parsecs, and, giant, variable, stars, including, cepheids, and, the, rr, lyrae, variables, the, motion, of, the, sun, through, space, provides, a, longer, baseline, that, will, increase, the, accuracy, of, parallax, measurements, known, as, secular, parallax, for, stars, in, the, milky, way, disk, this, corresponds, to, a, mean, baseline, of, 4, au, per, year, while, for, halo, stars, the, baseline, is, 40, au, per, year, after, several, decades, the, baseline, can, be, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, earth, sun, baseline, used, for, traditional, parallax, however, secular, parallax, introduces, a, higher, level, of, uncertainty, because, the, relative, velocity, of, observed, stars, is, an, additional, unknown, when, applied, to, samples, of, multiple, stars, the, uncertainty, can, be, reduced, the, uncertainty, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, sample, size, moving, cluster, parallax, is, a, technique, where, the, motions, of, individual, stars, in, a, nearby, star, cluster, can, be, used, to, find, the, distance, to, the, cluster, only, open, clusters, are, near, enough, for, this, technique, to, be, useful, in, particular, the, distance, obtained, for, the, hyades, has, historically, been, an, important, step, in, the, distance, ladder, other, individual, objects, can, have, fundamental, distance, estimates, made, for, them, under, special, circumstances, if, the, expansion, of, a, gas, cloud, like, a, supernova, remnant, or, planetary, nebula, can, be, observed, over, time, then, an, expansion, parallax, distance, to, that, cloud, can, be, estimated, those, measurements, however, suffer, from, uncertainties, in, the, deviation, of, the, object, from, sphericity, binary, stars, which, are, both, visual, and, spectroscopic, binaries, also, can, have, their, distance, estimated, by, similar, means, and, do, not, suffer, from, the, above, geometric, uncertainty, the, common, characteristic, to, these, methods, is, that, a, measurement, of, angular, motion, is, combined, with, a, measurement, of, the, absolute, velocity, usually, obtained, via, the, doppler, effect, the, distance, estimate, comes, from, computing, how, far, the, object, must, be, to, make, its, observed, absolute, velocity, appear, with, the, observed, angular, motion, measurements, made, by, viewing, the, position, of, some, marker, relative, to, something, to, be, measured, are, subject, to, parallax, error, if, the, marker, is, some, distance, away, from, the, object, of, measurement, and, not, viewed, from, the, correct, position, for, example, if, measuring, the, distance, between, two, ticks, on, a, line, with, a, ruler, marked, on, its, top, surface, the, thickness, of, the, ruler, will, separate, its, markings, from, the, ticks, if, viewed, from, a, position, not, exactly, perpendicular, to, the, ruler, the, apparent, position, will, shift, and, the, reading, will, be, less, accurate, than, the, ruler, is, capable, of, a, similar, error, occurs, when, reading, the, position, of, a, pointer, against, a, scale, in, an, instrument, such, as, an, analog, multimeter, to, help, the, user, avoid, this, problem, the, scale, is, sometimes, printed, above, a, narrow, strip, of, mirror, and, the, user, s, eye, is, positioned, so, that, the, pointer, obscures, its, reflection, guaranteeing, that, the, user, s, line, of, sight, is, perpendicular, to, the, mirror, and, therefore, to, the, scale, the, same, effect, alters, the, speed, read, on, a, car, s, speedometer, by, a, driver, in, front, of, it, and, a, passenger, off, to, the, side, values, read, from, a, graticule, not, in, actual, contact, with, the, display, on, an, oscilloscope, etc, when, viewed, through, a, stereo, viewer, aerial, picture, pair, offers, a, pronounced, stereo, effect, of, landscape, and, buildings, high, buildings, appear, to, keel, over, in, the, direction, away, from, the, center, of, the, photograph, measurements, of, this, parallax, are, used, to, deduce, the, height, of, the, buildings, provided, that, flying, height, and, baseline, distances, are, known, this, is, a, key, component, of, the, process, of, photogrammetry, parallax, error, can, be, seen, when, taking, photos, with, many, types, of, cameras, such, as, twin, lens, reflex, cameras, and, those, including, viewfinders, such, as, rangefinder, cameras, in, such, cameras, the, eye, sees, the, subject, through, different, optics, the, viewfinder, or, a, second, lens, than, the, one, through, which, the, photo, is, taken, as, the, viewfinder, is, often, found, above, the, lens, of, the, camera, photos, with, parallax, error, are, often, slightly, lower, than, intended, the, classic, example, being, the, image, of, a, person, with, their, head, cropped, off, this, problem, is, addressed, in, single, lens, reflex, cameras, in, which, the, viewfinder, sees, through, the, same, lens, through, which, the, photo, is, taken, with, the, aid, of, a, movable, mirror, thus, avoiding, parallax, error, parallax, is, also, an, issue, in, image, stitching, such, as, for, panoramas, parallax, affects, sighting, devices, of, ranged, weapons, in, many, ways, on, sights, fitted, on, small, arms, and, bows, etc, the, perpendicular, distance, between, the, sight, and, the, weapon, s, launch, axis, e, g, the, bore, axis, of, a, gun, generally, referred, to, as, sight, height, can, induce, significant, aiming, errors, when, shooting, at, close, range, particularly, when, shooting, at, small, targets, this, parallax, error, is, compensated, for, when, needed, via, calculations, that, also, take, in, other, variables, such, as, bullet, drop, windage, and, the, distance, at, which, the, target, is, expected, to, be, sight, height, can, be, used, to, advantage, when, sighting, in, rifles, for, field, use, a, typical, hunting, rifle, 222, with, telescopic, sights, sighted, in, at, 75m, will, still, be, useful, from, 50, to, 200, m, 55, to, 219, yd, without, needing, further, adjustment, in, some, reticled, optical, instruments, such, as, telescopes, microscopes, or, in, telescopic, sights, scopes, used, on, small, arms, and, theodolites, parallax, can, create, problems, when, the, reticle, is, not, coincident, with, the, focal, plane, of, the, target, image, this, is, because, when, the, reticle, and, the, target, are, not, at, the, same, focus, the, optically, corresponded, distances, being, projected, through, the, eyepiece, are, also, different, and, the, user, s, eye, will, register, the, difference, in, parallaxes, between, the, reticle, and, the, target, whenever, eye, position, changes, as, a, relative, displacement, on, top, of, each, other, the, term, parallax, shift, refers, to, the, resultant, apparent, floating, movements, of, the, reticle, over, the, target, image, when, the, user, moves, his, her, head, eye, laterally, up, down, or, left, right, behind, the, sight, i, e, an, error, where, the, reticle, does, not, stay, aligned, with, the, user, s, optical, axis, some, firearm, scopes, are, equipped, with, a, parallax, compensation, mechanism, which, consists, of, a, movable, optical, element, that, enables, the, optical, system, to, shift, the, focus, of, the, target, image, at, varying, distances, into, the, same, optical, plane, of, the, reticle, or, vice, versa, many, low, tier, telescopic, sights, may, have, no, parallax, compensation, because, in, practice, they, can, still, perform, very, acceptably, without, eliminating, parallax, shift, in, this, case, the, scope, is, often, set, fixed, at, a, designated, parallax, free, distance, that, best, suits, their, intended, usage, typical, standard, factory, parallax, free, distances, for, hunting, scopes, are, 100, yd, or, 90, m, to, make, them, suited, for, hunting, shots, that, rarely, exceed, 300, yd, m, some, competition, and, military, style, scopes, without, parallax, compensation, may, be, adjusted, to, be, parallax, free, at, ranges, up, to, 300, yd, m, to, make, them, better, suited, for, aiming, at, longer, ranges, scopes, for, guns, with, shorter, practical, ranges, such, as, airguns, rimfire, rifles, shotguns, and, muzzleloaders, will, have, parallax, settings, for, shorter, distances, commonly, 50, m, 55, yd, for, rimfire, scopes, and, 100, m, 110, yd, for, shotguns, and, muzzleloaders, airgun, scopes, are, very, often, found, with, adjustable, parallax, usually, in, the, form, of, an, adjustable, objective, or, ao, for, short, design, and, may, adjust, down, to, as, near, as, 3, metres, 3, 3, yd, non, magnifying, reflector, or, reflex, sights, can, be, theoretically, parallax, free, but, since, these, sights, use, parallel, collimated, light, this, is, only, true, when, the, target, is, at, infinity, at, finite, distances, eye, movement, perpendicular, to, the, device, will, cause, parallax, movement, in, the, reticle, image, in, exact, relationship, to, the, eye, position, in, the, cylindrical, column, of, light, created, by, the, collimating, optics, firearm, sights, such, as, some, red, dot, sights, try, to, correct, for, this, via, not, focusing, the, reticle, at, infinity, but, instead, at, some, finite, distance, a, designed, target, range, where, the, reticle, will, show, very, little, movement, due, to, parallax, some, manufacturers, market, reflector, sight, models, they, call, parallax, free, but, this, refers, to, an, optical, system, that, compensates, for, off, axis, spherical, aberration, an, optical, error, induced, by, the, spherical, mirror, used, in, the, sight, that, can, cause, the, reticle, position, to, diverge, off, the, sight, s, optical, axis, with, change, in, eye, position, because, of, the, positioning, of, field, or, naval, artillery, guns, each, one, has, a, slightly, different, perspective, of, the, target, relative, to, the, location, of, the, fire, control, system, itself, therefore, when, aiming, its, guns, at, the, target, the, fire, control, system, must, compensate, for, parallax, in, order, to, assure, that, fire, from, each, gun, converges, on, the, target, several, of, mark, renn, s, sculptural, works, play, with, parallax, appearing, abstract, until, viewed, from, a, specific, angle, one, such, sculpture, is, the, darwin, gate, pictured, in, shrewsbury, england, which, from, a, certain, angle, appears, to, form, a, dome, according, to, historic, england, in, the, form, of, a, saxon, helmet, with, a, norman, window, inspired, by, features, of, st, mary, s, church, which, was, attended, by, charles, darwin, as, a, boy, in, a, philosophic, geometric, sense, an, apparent, change, in, the, direction, of, an, object, caused, by, a, change, in, observational, position, that, provides, a, new, line, of, sight, the, apparent, displacement, or, difference, of, position, of, an, object, as, seen, from, two, different, stations, or, points, of, view, in, contemporary, writing, parallax, can, also, be, the, same, story, or, a, similar, story, from, approximately, the, same, timeline, from, one, book, told, from, a, different, perspective, in, another, book, the, word, and, concept, feature, prominently, in, james, joyce, s, 1922, novel, ulysses, orson, scott, card, also, used, the, term, when, referring, to, ender, s, shadow, as, compared, to, ender, s, game, the, metaphor, is, invoked, by, slovenian, philosopher, slavoj, i, ek, in, his, 2006, book, the, parallax, view, borrowing, the, concept, of, parallax, view, from, the, japanese, philosopher, and, literary, critic, kojin, karatani, i, ek, notes, the, philosophical, twist, to, be, added, to, parallax, of, course, is, that, the, observed, distance, is, not, simply, subjective, since, the, same, object, that, exists, out, there, is, seen, from, two, different, stances, or, points, of, view, it, is, rather, that, as, hegel, would, have, put, it, subject, and, object, are, inherently, mediated, so, that, an, epistemological, shift, in, the, subject, s, point, of, view, always, reflects, an, ontological, shift, in, the, object, itself, or, to, put, it, in, lacanese, the, subject, s, gaze, is, always, already, inscribed, into, the, perceived, object, itself, in, the, guise, of, its, blind, spot, that, which, is, in, the, object, more, than, the, object, itself, the, point, from, which, the, object, itself, returns, the, gaze, sure, the, picture, is, in, my, eye, but, i, am, also, in, the, picture
