calcium, carbonate, is, a, chemical, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, ca, co, 3, it, is, a, common, substance, found, in, rocks, as, the, minerals, calcite, and, aragonite, most, notably, in, chalk, and, limestone, eggshells, gastropod, shells, shellfish, skeletons, and, pearls, materials, containing, much, calcium, carbonate, or, resembling, it, are, described, as, calcareous, calcium, carbonate, is, the, active, ingredient, in, agricultural, lime, and, is, produced, when, calcium, ions, in, hard, water, react, with, carbonate, ions, to, form, limescale, it, has, medical, use, as, a, calcium, supplement, or, as, an, antacid, but, excessive, consumption, can, be, hazardous, and, cause, hypercalcemia, and, digestive, issues, calcium, carbonate, shares, the, typical, properties, of, other, carbonates, notably, it, calcium, carbonate, reacts, with, water, that, is, saturated, with, carbon, dioxide, to, form, the, soluble, calcium, bicarbonate, this, reaction, is, important, in, the, erosion, of, carbonate, rock, forming, caverns, and, leads, to, hard, water, in, many, regions, an, unusual, form, of, calcium, carbonate, is, the, hexahydrate, ikaite, caco, 3, 6h, 2, o, ikaite, is, stable, only, below, 8, c, the, vast, majority, of, calcium, carbonate, used, in, industry, is, extracted, by, mining, or, quarrying, pure, calcium, carbonate, such, as, for, food, or, pharmaceutical, use, can, be, produced, from, a, pure, quarried, source, usually, marble, alternatively, calcium, carbonate, is, prepared, from, calcium, oxide, water, is, added, to, give, calcium, hydroxide, then, carbon, dioxide, is, passed, through, this, solution, to, precipitate, the, desired, calcium, carbonate, referred, to, in, the, industry, as, precipitated, calcium, carbonate, pcc, this, process, is, called, carbonatation, in, a, laboratory, calcium, carbonate, can, easily, be, crystallized, from, calcium, chloride, cacl, 2, by, placing, an, aqueous, solution, of, cacl, 2, in, a, desiccator, alongside, ammonium, carbonate, 2, co, 3, in, the, desiccator, ammonium, carbonate, is, exposed, to, air, and, decomposes, into, ammonia, carbon, dioxide, and, water, the, carbon, dioxide, then, diffuses, into, the, aqueous, solution, of, calcium, chloride, reacts, with, the, calcium, ions, and, the, water, and, forms, calcium, carbonate, the, thermodynamically, stable, form, of, caco, 3, under, normal, conditions, is, hexagonal, caco, 3, the, mineral, calcite, other, forms, can, be, prepared, the, denser, 2, 83, g, cm, 3, orthorhombic, caco, 3, the, mineral, aragonite, and, hexagonal, caco, 3, occurring, as, the, mineral, vaterite, the, aragonite, form, can, be, prepared, by, precipitation, at, temperatures, above, 85, c, the, vaterite, form, can, be, prepared, by, precipitation, at, 60, c, calcite, contains, calcium, atoms, coordinated, by, six, oxygen, atoms, in, aragonite, they, are, coordinated, by, nine, oxygen, atoms, the, vaterite, structure, is, not, fully, understood, magnesium, carbonate, mgco, 3, has, the, calcite, structure, whereas, strontium, carbonate, srco, 3, and, barium, carbonate, baco, 3, adopt, the, aragonite, structure, reflecting, their, larger, ionic, radii, calcium, carbonate, crystallizes, in, three, anhydrous, polymorphs, of, which, calcite, is, the, thermodynamically, most, stable, at, room, temperature, aragonite, is, only, slightly, less, so, and, vaterite, is, the, least, stable, the, calcite, crystal, structure, is, trigonal, with, space, group, r, 3, c, no, 167, in, the, international, tables, for, crystallography, and, pearson, symbol, hr10, aragonite, is, orthorhombic, with, space, group, pmcn, no, 62, and, pearson, symbol, op20, vaterite, is, composed, of, at, least, two, different, coexisting, crystallographic, structures, the, major, structure, exhibits, hexagonal, symmetry, in, space, group, p6, 3, mmc, the, minor, structure, is, still, unknown, all, three, polymorphs, crystallize, simultaneously, from, aqueous, solutions, under, ambient, conditions, in, additive, free, aqueous, solutions, calcite, forms, easily, as, the, major, product, while, aragonite, appears, only, as, a, minor, product, at, high, saturation, vaterite, is, typically, the, first, phase, precipitated, which, is, followed, by, a, transformation, of, the, vaterite, to, calcite, this, behavior, seems, to, follow, ostwald, s, rule, in, which, the, least, stable, polymorph, crystallizes, first, followed, by, the, crystallization, of, different, polymorphs, via, a, sequence, of, increasingly, stable, phases, however, aragonite, whose, stability, lies, between, those, of, vaterite, and, calcite, seems, to, be, the, exception, to, this, rule, as, aragonite, does, not, form, as, a, precursor, to, calcite, under, ambient, conditions, aragonite, occurs, in, majority, when, the, reaction, conditions, inhibit, the, formation, of, calcite, and, or, promote, the, nucleation, of, aragonite, for, example, the, formation, of, aragonite, is, promoted, by, the, presence, of, magnesium, ions, or, by, using, proteins, and, peptides, derived, from, biological, calcium, carbonate, some, polyamines, such, as, cadaverine, and, poly, ethylene, imine, have, been, shown, to, facilitate, the, formation, of, aragonite, over, calcite, organisms, such, as, molluscs, and, arthropods, have, shown, the, ability, to, grow, all, three, crystal, polymorphs, of, calcium, carbonate, mainly, as, protection, shells, and, muscle, attachments, moreover, they, exhibit, a, remarkable, capability, of, phase, selection, over, calcite, and, aragonite, and, some, organisms, can, switch, between, the, two, polymorphs, the, ability, of, phase, selection, is, usually, attributed, to, the, use, of, specific, macromolecules, or, combinations, of, macromolecules, by, such, organisms, calcite, aragonite, and, vaterite, are, pure, calcium, carbonate, minerals, industrially, important, source, rocks, which, are, predominantly, calcium, carbonate, include, limestone, chalk, marble, and, travertine, eggshells, snail, shells, and, most, seashells, are, predominantly, calcium, carbonate, and, can, be, used, as, industrial, sources, of, that, chemical, oyster, shells, have, enjoyed, recent, recognition, as, a, source, of, dietary, calcium, but, are, also, a, practical, industrial, source, dark, green, vegetables, such, as, broccoli, and, kale, contain, dietarily, significant, amounts, of, calcium, carbonate, but, they, are, not, practical, as, an, industrial, source, annelids, in, the, family, lumbricidae, earthworms, possess, a, regionalization, of, the, digestive, track, called, calciferous, glands, kalkdr, sen, or, glandes, de, morren, that, processes, calcium, and, co, 2, into, calcium, carbonate, which, is, later, excreted, into, the, dirt, the, function, of, these, glands, is, unknown, but, is, believed, to, serve, as, a, co, 2, regulation, mechanism, within, the, animals, tissues, this, process, is, ecologically, significant, stabilizing, the, ph, of, acid, soils, beyond, earth, strong, evidence, suggests, the, presence, of, calcium, carbonate, on, mars, signs, of, calcium, carbonate, have, been, detected, at, more, than, one, location, notably, at, gusev, and, huygens, craters, this, provides, some, evidence, for, the, past, presence, of, liquid, water, carbonate, is, found, frequently, in, geologic, settings, and, constitutes, an, enormous, carbon, reservoir, calcium, carbonate, occurs, as, aragonite, calcite, and, dolomite, as, significant, constituents, of, the, calcium, cycle, the, carbonate, minerals, form, the, rock, types, limestone, chalk, marble, travertine, tufa, and, others, in, warm, clear, tropical, waters, corals, are, more, abundant, than, towards, the, poles, where, the, waters, are, cold, calcium, carbonate, contributors, including, plankton, such, as, coccoliths, and, planktic, foraminifera, coralline, algae, sponges, brachiopods, echinoderms, bryozoa, and, mollusks, are, typically, found, in, shallow, water, environments, where, sunlight, and, filterable, food, are, more, abundant, cold, water, carbonates, do, exist, at, higher, latitudes, but, have, a, very, slow, growth, rate, the, calcification, processes, are, changed, by, ocean, acidification, where, the, oceanic, crust, is, subducted, under, a, continental, plate, sediments, will, be, carried, down, to, warmer, zones, in, the, asthenosphere, and, lithosphere, under, these, conditions, calcium, carbonate, decomposes, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, which, along, with, other, gases, give, rise, to, explosive, volcanic, eruptions, the, carbonate, compensation, depth, ccd, is, the, point, in, the, ocean, where, the, rate, of, precipitation, of, calcium, carbonate, is, balanced, by, the, rate, of, dissolution, due, to, the, conditions, present, deep, in, the, ocean, the, temperature, drops, and, pressure, increases, increasing, pressure, also, increases, the, solubility, of, calcium, carbonate, calcium, carbonate, is, unusual, in, that, its, solubility, increases, with, decreasing, temperature, the, carbonate, compensation, depth, ranges, from, 4, 000, to, 6, 000, meters, below, sea, level, in, modern, oceans, and, the, various, polymorphs, calcite, aragonite, have, different, compensation, depths, based, on, their, stability, calcium, carbonate, can, preserve, fossils, through, permineralization, most, of, the, vertebrate, fossils, of, the, two, medicine, formation, a, geologic, formation, known, for, its, duck, billed, dinosaur, eggs, are, preserved, by, caco, 3, permineralization, this, type, of, preservation, conserves, high, levels, of, detail, even, down, to, the, microscopic, level, however, it, also, leaves, specimens, vulnerable, to, weathering, when, exposed, to, the, surface, trilobite, populations, were, once, thought, to, have, composed, the, majority, of, aquatic, life, during, the, cambrian, due, to, the, fact, that, their, calcium, carbonate, rich, shells, were, more, easily, preserved, than, those, of, other, species, which, had, purely, chitinous, shells, the, main, use, of, calcium, carbonate, is, in, the, construction, industry, either, as, a, building, material, or, limestone, aggregate, for, road, building, as, an, ingredient, of, cement, or, as, the, starting, material, for, the, preparation, of, builders, lime, by, burning, in, a, kiln, however, because, of, weathering, mainly, caused, by, acid, rain, calcium, carbonate, in, limestone, form, is, no, longer, used, for, building, purposes, on, its, own, but, only, as, a, raw, primary, substance, for, building, materials, calcium, carbonate, is, also, used, in, the, purification, of, iron, from, iron, ore, in, a, blast, furnace, the, carbonate, is, calcined, in, situ, to, give, calcium, oxide, which, forms, a, slag, with, various, impurities, present, and, separates, from, the, purified, iron, in, the, oil, industry, calcium, carbonate, is, added, to, drilling, fluids, as, a, formation, bridging, and, filtercake, sealing, agent, it, is, also, a, weighting, material, which, increases, the, density, of, drilling, fluids, to, control, the, downhole, pressure, calcium, carbonate, is, added, to, swimming, pools, as, a, ph, corrector, for, maintaining, alkalinity, and, offsetting, the, acidic, properties, of, the, disinfectant, agent, it, is, also, used, as, a, raw, material, in, the, refining, of, sugar, from, sugar, beet, it, is, calcined, in, a, kiln, with, anthracite, to, produce, calcium, oxide, and, carbon, dioxide, this, burnt, lime, is, then, slaked, in, fresh, water, to, produce, a, calcium, hydroxide, suspension, for, the, precipitation, of, impurities, in, raw, juice, during, carbonatation, calcium, carbonate, in, the, form, of, chalk, has, traditionally, been, a, major, component, of, blackboard, chalk, however, modern, manufactured, chalk, is, mostly, gypsum, hydrated, calcium, sulfate, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, calcium, carbonate, is, a, main, source, for, growing, biorock, precipitated, calcium, carbonate, pcc, pre, dispersed, in, slurry, form, is, a, common, filler, material, for, latex, gloves, with, the, aim, of, achieving, maximum, saving, in, material, and, production, costs, fine, ground, calcium, carbonate, gcc, is, an, essential, ingredient, in, the, microporous, film, used, in, diapers, and, some, building, films, as, the, pores, are, nucleated, around, the, calcium, carbonate, particles, during, the, manufacture, of, the, film, by, biaxial, stretching, gcc, and, pcc, are, used, as, a, filler, in, paper, because, they, are, cheaper, than, wood, fiber, printing, and, writing, paper, can, contain, 10, 20, calcium, carbonate, in, north, america, calcium, carbonate, has, begun, to, replace, kaolin, in, the, production, of, glossy, paper, europe, has, been, practicing, this, as, alkaline, papermaking, or, acid, free, papermaking, for, some, decades, pcc, used, for, paper, filling, and, paper, coatings, is, precipitated, and, prepared, in, a, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, having, characteristic, narrow, particle, size, distributions, and, equivalent, spherical, diameters, of, 0, 4, to, 3, micrometers, calcium, carbonate, is, widely, used, as, an, extender, in, paints, in, particular, matte, emulsion, paint, where, typically, 30, by, weight, of, the, paint, is, either, chalk, or, marble, it, is, also, a, popular, filler, in, plastics, some, typical, examples, include, around, 15, 20, loading, of, chalk, in, unplasticized, polyvinyl, chloride, upvc, drainpipes, 5, 15, loading, of, stearate, coated, chalk, or, marble, in, upvc, window, profile, pvc, cables, can, use, calcium, carbonate, at, loadings, of, up, to, 70, phr, parts, per, hundred, parts, of, resin, to, improve, mechanical, properties, tensile, strength, and, elongation, and, electrical, properties, volume, resistivity, polypropylene, compounds, are, often, filled, with, calcium, carbonate, to, increase, rigidity, a, requirement, that, becomes, important, at, high, usage, temperatures, here, the, percentage, is, often, 20, 40, it, also, routinely, used, as, a, filler, in, thermosetting, resins, sheet, and, bulk, molding, compounds, and, has, also, been, mixed, with, abs, and, other, ingredients, to, form, some, types, of, compression, molded, clay, poker, chips, precipitated, calcium, carbonate, made, by, dropping, calcium, oxide, into, water, is, used, by, itself, or, with, additives, as, a, white, paint, known, as, whitewashing, calcium, carbonate, is, added, to, a, wide, range, of, trade, and, do, it, yourself, adhesives, sealants, and, decorating, fillers, ceramic, tile, adhesives, typically, contain, 70, to, 80, limestone, decorating, crack, fillers, contain, similar, levels, of, marble, or, dolomite, it, is, also, mixed, with, putty, in, setting, stained, glass, windows, and, as, a, resist, to, prevent, glass, from, sticking, to, kiln, shelves, when, firing, glazes, and, paints, at, high, temperature, in, ceramic, glaze, applications, calcium, carbonate, is, known, as, whiting, and, is, a, common, ingredient, for, many, glazes, in, its, white, powdered, form, when, a, glaze, containing, this, material, is, fired, in, a, kiln, the, whiting, acts, as, a, flux, material, in, the, glaze, ground, calcium, carbonate, is, an, abrasive, both, as, scouring, powder, and, as, an, ingredient, of, household, scouring, creams, in, particular, in, its, calcite, form, which, has, the, relatively, low, hardness, level, of, 3, on, the, mohs, scale, and, will, therefore, not, scratch, glass, and, most, other, ceramics, enamel, bronze, iron, and, steel, and, have, a, moderate, effect, on, softer, metals, like, aluminium, and, copper, a, paste, made, from, calcium, carbonate, and, deionized, water, can, be, used, to, clean, tarnish, on, silver, calcium, carbonate, is, widely, used, medicinally, as, an, inexpensive, dietary, calcium, supplement, for, gastric, antacid, such, as, tums, and, eno, it, may, be, used, as, a, phosphate, binder, for, the, treatment, of, hyperphosphatemia, primarily, in, patients, with, chronic, kidney, failure, it, is, used, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, as, an, inert, filler, for, tablets, and, other, pharmaceuticals, calcium, carbonate, is, used, in, the, production, of, calcium, oxide, as, well, as, toothpaste, and, has, seen, a, resurgence, as, a, food, preservative, and, color, retainer, when, used, in, or, with, products, such, as, organic, apples, calcium, carbonate, is, used, therapeutically, as, phosphate, binder, in, patients, on, maintenance, haemodialysis, it, is, the, most, common, form, of, phosphate, binder, prescribed, particularly, in, non, dialysis, chronic, kidney, disease, calcium, carbonate, is, the, most, commonly, used, phosphate, binder, but, clinicians, are, increasingly, prescribing, the, more, expensive, non, calcium, based, phosphate, binders, particularly, sevelamer, excess, calcium, from, supplements, fortified, food, and, high, calcium, diets, can, cause, milk, alkali, syndrome, which, has, serious, toxicity, and, can, be, fatal, in, 1915, bertram, sippy, introduced, the, sippy, regimen, of, hourly, ingestion, of, milk, and, cream, and, the, gradual, addition, of, eggs, and, cooked, cereal, for, 10, days, combined, with, alkaline, powders, which, provided, symptomatic, relief, for, peptic, ulcer, disease, over, the, next, several, decades, the, sippy, regimen, resulted, in, kidney, failure, alkalosis, and, hypercalcaemia, mostly, in, men, with, peptic, ulcer, disease, these, adverse, effects, were, reversed, when, the, regimen, stopped, but, it, was, fatal, in, some, patients, with, protracted, vomiting, milk, alkali, syndrome, declined, in, men, after, effective, treatments, for, peptic, ulcer, disease, arose, since, the, 1990s, it, has, been, most, frequently, reported, in, women, taking, calcium, supplements, above, the, recommended, range, of, 1, 2, to, 1, 5, grams, daily, for, prevention, and, treatment, of, osteoporosis, and, is, exacerbated, by, dehydration, calcium, has, been, added, to, over, the, counter, products, which, contributes, to, inadvertent, excessive, intake, excessive, calcium, intake, can, lead, to, hypercalcemia, complications, of, which, include, vomiting, abdominal, pain, and, altered, mental, status, as, a, food, additive, it, is, designated, e170, and, it, has, an, ins, number, of, 170, used, as, an, acidity, regulator, anticaking, agent, stabilizer, or, color, it, is, approved, for, usage, in, the, eu, us, and, australia, and, new, zealand, it, is, added, by, law, to, all, uk, milled, bread, flour, except, wholemeal, it, is, used, in, some, soy, milk, and, almond, milk, products, as, a, source, of, dietary, calcium, at, least, one, study, suggests, that, calcium, carbonate, might, be, as, bioavailable, as, the, calcium, in, cow, s, milk, calcium, carbonate, is, also, used, as, a, firming, agent, in, many, canned, and, bottled, vegetable, products, several, calcium, supplement, formulations, have, been, documented, to, contain, the, chemical, element, lead, posing, a, public, health, concern, lead, is, commonly, found, in, natural, sources, of, calcium, agricultural, lime, powdered, chalk, or, limestone, is, used, as, a, cheap, method, of, neutralising, acidic, soil, making, it, suitable, for, planting, also, used, in, aquaculture, industry, for, ph, regulation, of, pond, soil, before, initiating, culture, there, is, interest, in, understanding, whether, or, not, it, can, affect, pesticide, adsorption, and, desorption, in, calcareous, soil, calcium, carbonate, is, a, key, ingredient, in, many, household, cleaning, powders, like, comet, and, is, used, as, a, scrubbing, agent, in, 1989, a, researcher, ken, simmons, introduced, caco, 3, into, the, whetstone, brook, in, massachusetts, his, hope, was, that, the, calcium, carbonate, would, counter, the, acid, in, the, stream, from, acid, rain, and, save, the, trout, that, had, ceased, to, spawn, although, his, experiment, was, a, success, it, did, increase, the, amount, of, aluminium, ions, in, the, area, of, the, brook, that, was, not, treated, with, the, limestone, this, shows, that, caco, 3, can, be, added, to, neutralize, the, effects, of, acid, rain, in, river, ecosystems, currently, calcium, carbonate, is, used, to, neutralize, acidic, conditions, in, both, soil, and, water, since, the, 1970s, such, liming, has, been, practiced, on, a, large, scale, in, sweden, to, mitigate, acidification, and, several, thousand, lakes, and, streams, are, limed, repeatedly, calcium, carbonate, is, also, used, in, flue, gas, desulfurization, applications, eliminating, harmful, so, 2, and, no, 2, emissions, from, coal, and, other, fossil, fuels, burnt, in, large, fossil, fuel, power, stations, calcium, carbonate, is, commonly, used, in, the, plastic, industry, as, a, filler, when, it, is, incorporated, in, a, plastic, material, it, can, improve, the, hardness, stiffness, dimensional, stability, and, processability, of, the, material, calcination, of, limestone, using, charcoal, fires, to, produce, quicklime, has, been, practiced, since, antiquity, by, cultures, all, over, the, world, the, temperature, at, which, limestone, yields, calcium, oxide, is, usually, given, as, 825, c, but, stating, an, absolute, threshold, is, misleading, calcium, carbonate, exists, in, equilibrium, with, calcium, oxide, and, carbon, dioxide, at, any, temperature, at, each, temperature, there, is, a, partial, pressure, of, carbon, dioxide, that, is, in, equilibrium, with, calcium, carbonate, at, room, temperature, the, equilibrium, overwhelmingly, favors, calcium, carbonate, because, the, equilibrium, co, 2, pressure, is, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, partial, co, 2, pressure, in, air, which, is, about, 0, 035, kpa, at, temperatures, above, 550, c, the, equilibrium, co, 2, pressure, begins, to, exceed, the, co, 2, pressure, in, air, so, above, 550, c, calcium, carbonate, begins, to, outgas, co, 2, into, air, however, in, a, charcoal, fired, kiln, the, concentration, of, co, 2, will, be, much, higher, than, it, is, in, air, indeed, if, all, the, oxygen, in, the, kiln, is, consumed, in, the, fire, then, the, partial, pressure, of, co, 2, in, the, kiln, can, be, as, high, as, 20, kpa, the, table, shows, that, this, partial, pressure, is, not, achieved, until, the, temperature, is, nearly, 800, c, for, the, outgassing, of, co, 2, from, calcium, carbonate, to, happen, at, an, economically, useful, rate, the, equilibrium, pressure, must, significantly, exceed, the, ambient, pressure, of, co, 2, and, for, it, to, happen, rapidly, the, equilibrium, pressure, must, exceed, total, atmospheric, pressure, of, 101, kpa, which, happens, at, 898, c, calcium, carbonate, is, poorly, soluble, in, pure, water, 47, mg, l, at, normal, atmospheric, co, 2, partial, pressure, as, shown, below, the, equilibrium, of, its, solution, is, given, by, the, equation, with, dissolved, calcium, carbonate, on, the, right, where, the, solubility, product, for, is, given, as, anywhere, from, k, sp, 3, 7, 10, 9, to, k, sp, 8, 7, 10, 9, at, 25, c, depending, upon, the, data, source, what, the, equation, means, is, that, the, product, of, molar, concentration, of, calcium, ions, moles, of, dissolved, ca, 2, per, liter, of, solution, with, the, molar, concentration, of, dissolved, co, 2, 3, cannot, exceed, the, value, of, k, sp, this, seemingly, simple, solubility, equation, however, must, be, taken, along, with, the, more, complicated, equilibrium, of, carbon, dioxide, with, water, see, carbonic, acid, some, of, the, co, 2, 3, combines, with, h, in, the, solution, according, to, hco, 3, is, known, as, the, bicarbonate, ion, calcium, bicarbonate, is, many, times, more, soluble, in, water, than, calcium, carbonate, indeed, it, exists, only, in, solution, some, of, the, hco, 3, combines, with, h, in, solution, according, to, some, of, the, h, 2, co, 3, breaks, up, into, water, and, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, according, to, and, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, is, in, equilibrium, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, according, to, for, ambient, air, p, co, 2, is, around, 3, 5, 10, 4, atm, or, equivalently, 35, pa, the, last, equation, above, fixes, the, concentration, of, dissolved, co, 2, as, a, function, of, p, co, 2, independent, of, the, concentration, of, dissolved, caco, 3, at, atmospheric, partial, pressure, of, co, 2, dissolved, co, 2, concentration, is, 1, 2, 10, 5, moles, per, liter, the, equation, before, that, fixes, the, concentration, of, h, 2, co, 3, as, a, function, of, co, 2, concentration, for, 1, 2, 10, 5, it, results, in, 2, 0, 10, 8, moles, per, liter, when, is, known, the, remaining, three, equations, together, with, which, is, true, for, all, aqueous, solutions, and, the, constraint, that, the, solution, must, be, electrically, neutral, i, e, the, overall, charge, of, dissolved, positive, ions, 2, must, be, cancelled, out, by, the, overall, charge, of, dissolved, negative, ions, make, it, possible, to, solve, simultaneously, for, the, remaining, five, unknown, concentrations, the, previously, mentioned, form, of, the, neutrality, is, valid, only, if, calcium, carbonate, has, been, put, in, contact, with, pure, water, or, with, a, neutral, ph, solution, in, the, case, where, the, initial, water, solvent, ph, is, not, neutral, the, balance, is, not, neutral, the, adjacent, table, shows, the, result, for, and, in, the, form, of, ph, as, a, function, of, ambient, partial, pressure, of, co, 2, k, sp, 4, 47, 10, 9, has, been, taken, for, the, calculation, the, effect, of, the, latter, is, especially, evident, in, day, to, day, life, of, people, who, have, hard, water, water, in, aquifers, underground, can, be, exposed, to, levels, of, co, 2, much, higher, than, atmospheric, as, such, water, percolates, through, calcium, carbonate, rock, the, caco, 3, dissolves, according, to, one, of, the, trends, above, when, that, same, water, then, emerges, from, the, tap, in, time, it, comes, into, equilibrium, with, co, 2, levels, in, the, air, by, outgassing, its, excess, co, 2, the, calcium, carbonate, becomes, less, soluble, as, a, result, and, the, excess, precipitates, as, lime, scale, this, same, process, is, responsible, for, the, formation, of, stalactites, and, stalagmites, in, limestone, caves, two, hydrated, phases, of, calcium, carbonate, monohydrocalcite, caco, 3, h, 2, o, and, ikaite, caco, 3, 6h, 2, o, may, precipitate, from, water, at, ambient, conditions, and, persist, as, metastable, phases, in, contrast, to, the, open, equilibrium, scenario, above, many, swimming, pools, are, managed, by, addition, of, sodium, bicarbonate, nahco, 3, to, the, concentration, of, about, 2, mmol, l, as, a, buffer, then, control, of, ph, through, use, of, hcl, nahso, 4, na, 2, co, 3, naoh, or, chlorine, formulations, that, are, acidic, or, basic, in, this, situation, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, total, inorganic, carbon, is, far, from, equilibrium, with, atmospheric, co, 2, progress, towards, equilibrium, through, outgassing, of, co, 2, is, slowed, by, in, this, situation, the, dissociation, constants, for, the, much, faster, reactions, allow, the, prediction, of, concentrations, of, each, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, species, in, solution, from, the, added, concentration, of, hco, 3, which, constitutes, more, than, 90, of, bjerrum, plot, species, from, ph, 7, to, ph, 8, at, 25, c, in, fresh, water, addition, of, hco, 3, will, increase, co, 2, 3, concentration, at, any, ph, rearranging, the, equations, given, above, we, can, see, that, k, sp, and, k, a2, therefore, when, hco, 3, concentration, is, known, the, maximum, concentration, of, ca, 2, ions, before, scaling, through, caco, 3, precipitation, can, be, predicted, from, the, formula, the, solubility, product, for, caco, 3, k, sp, and, the, dissociation, constants, for, the, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, species, including, k, a2, are, all, substantially, affected, by, temperature, and, salinity, with, the, overall, effect, that, max, increases, from, freshwater, to, saltwater, and, decreases, with, rising, temperature, ph, or, added, bicarbonate, level, as, illustrated, in, the, accompanying, graphs, the, trends, are, illustrative, for, pool, management, but, whether, scaling, occurs, also, depends, on, other, factors, including, interactions, with, mg, 2, and, other, ions, in, the, pool, as, well, as, supersaturation, effects, scaling, is, commonly, observed, in, electrolytic, chlorine, generators, where, there, is, a, high, ph, near, the, cathode, surface, and, scale, deposition, further, increases, temperature, this, is, one, reason, that, some, pool, operators, prefer, borate, over, bicarbonate, as, the, primary, ph, buffer, and, avoid, the, use, of, pool, chemicals, containing, calcium, solutions, of, strong, hcl, moderately, strong, sulfamic, or, weak, acetic, citric, sorbic, lactic, phosphoric, acids, are, commercially, available, they, are, commonly, used, as, descaling, agents, to, remove, limescale, deposits, the, maximum, amount, of, caco, 3, that, can, be, dissolved, by, one, liter, of, an, acid, solution, can, be, calculated, using, the, above, equilibrium, equations
