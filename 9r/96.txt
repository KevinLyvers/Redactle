ceres, minor, planet, designation, 1, ceres, is, a, dwarf, planet, in, the, middle, main, asteroid, belt, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, it, was, the, first, known, asteroid, discovered, on, 1, january, 1801, by, giuseppe, piazzi, at, palermo, astronomical, observatory, in, sicily, and, announced, as, a, new, planet, ceres, was, later, classified, as, an, asteroid, and, then, a, dwarf, planet, the, only, one, not, beyond, neptune, s, orbit, ceres, s, small, size, means, that, even, at, its, brightest, it, is, too, dim, to, be, seen, by, the, naked, eye, except, under, extremely, dark, skies, its, apparent, magnitude, ranges, from, 6, 7, to, 9, 3, peaking, at, opposition, when, it, is, closest, to, earth, once, every, 15, to, 16, month, synodic, period, as, a, result, its, surface, features, are, barely, visible, even, with, the, most, powerful, telescopes, and, little, was, known, about, it, until, the, robotic, nasa, spacecraft, dawn, approached, ceres, for, its, orbital, mission, in, 2015, dawn, found, ceres, s, surface, to, be, a, mixture, of, water, ice, and, hydrated, minerals, such, as, carbonates, and, clay, gravity, data, suggest, ceres, to, be, partially, differentiated, into, a, muddy, ice, rock, mantle, core, and, a, less, dense, but, stronger, crust, that, is, at, most, thirty, per, cent, ice, by, volume, although, ceres, likely, lacks, an, internal, ocean, of, liquid, water, brines, still, flow, through, the, outer, mantle, and, reach, the, surface, allowing, cryovolcanoes, such, as, ahuna, mons, to, form, roughly, every, fifty, million, years, this, makes, ceres, the, closest, known, cryovolcanically, active, body, to, the, sun, additionally, ceres, hosts, an, extremely, tenuous, and, transient, atmosphere, of, water, vapour, vented, from, localised, sources, on, its, surface, in, the, years, between, the, acceptance, of, heliocentrism, in, the, 18th, century, and, the, discovery, of, neptune, in, 1846, several, astronomers, argued, that, mathematical, laws, predicted, the, existence, of, a, hidden, or, missing, planet, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, in, 1596, theoretical, astronomer, johannes, kepler, believed, that, the, ratios, between, planetary, orbits, would, conform, to, god, s, design, only, with, the, addition, of, two, planets, one, between, jupiter, and, mars, and, one, between, venus, and, mercury, other, theoreticians, such, as, immanuel, kant, pondered, whether, the, gap, had, been, created, by, the, gravity, of, jupiter, in, 1761, astronomer, and, mathematician, johann, heinrich, lambert, asked, and, who, knows, whether, already, planets, are, missing, which, have, departed, from, the, vast, space, between, mars, and, jupiter, does, it, then, hold, of, celestial, bodies, as, well, as, of, the, earth, that, the, stronger, chafe, the, weaker, and, are, jupiter, and, saturn, destined, to, plunder, forever, in, 1772, german, astronomer, johann, elert, bode, citing, johann, daniel, titius, published, a, formula, later, known, as, the, titius, bode, law, that, appeared, to, predict, the, orbits, of, the, known, planets, but, for, an, unexplained, gap, between, mars, and, jupiter, this, formula, predicted, that, there, ought, to, be, another, planet, with, an, orbital, radius, near, 2, 8, astronomical, units, au, or, 420, million, km, from, the, sun, the, titius, bode, law, gained, more, credence, with, william, herschel, s, 1781, discovery, of, uranus, near, the, predicted, distance, for, a, planet, beyond, saturn, in, 1800, a, group, headed, by, franz, xaver, von, zach, editor, of, the, german, astronomical, journal, monatliche, correspondenz, monthly, correspondence, sent, requests, to, twenty, four, experienced, astronomers, whom, he, dubbed, the, celestial, police, asking, that, they, combine, their, efforts, and, begin, a, methodical, search, for, the, expected, planet, although, they, did, not, discover, ceres, they, later, found, the, asteroids, pallas, juno, and, vesta, one, of, the, astronomers, selected, for, the, search, was, giuseppe, piazzi, a, catholic, priest, at, the, academy, of, palermo, sicily, before, receiving, his, invitation, to, join, the, group, piazzi, discovered, ceres, on, 1, january, 1801, he, was, searching, for, the, 87th, of, the, catalogue, of, the, zodiacal, stars, of, mr, la, caille, but, found, that, it, was, preceded, by, another, instead, of, a, star, piazzi, had, found, a, moving, starlike, object, which, he, first, thought, was, a, comet, piazzi, observed, ceres, twenty, four, times, the, final, sighting, occurring, on, 11, february, 1801, when, illness, interrupted, his, work, he, announced, his, discovery, on, 24, january, 1801, in, letters, to, two, fellow, astronomers, his, compatriot, barnaba, oriani, of, milan, and, bode, in, berlin, he, reported, it, as, a, comet, but, since, its, movement, is, so, slow, and, rather, uniform, it, has, occurred, to, me, several, times, that, it, might, be, something, better, than, a, comet, in, april, piazzi, sent, his, complete, observations, to, oriani, bode, and, french, astronomer, j, r, me, lalande, the, information, was, published, in, the, september, 1801, issue, of, the, monatliche, correspondenz, by, this, time, the, apparent, position, of, ceres, had, changed, primarily, due, to, earth, s, motion, around, the, sun, and, was, too, close, to, the, sun, s, glare, for, other, astronomers, to, confirm, piazzi, s, observations, towards, the, end, of, the, year, ceres, should, have, been, visible, again, but, after, such, a, long, time, it, was, difficult, to, predict, its, exact, position, to, recover, ceres, mathematician, carl, friedrich, gauss, then, twenty, four, years, old, developed, an, efficient, method, of, orbit, determination, he, predicted, the, path, of, ceres, within, a, few, weeks, and, sent, his, results, to, von, zach, on, 31, december, 1801, von, zach, and, fellow, celestial, policeman, heinrich, w, m, olbers, found, ceres, near, the, predicted, position, and, continued, to, record, its, position, at, 2, 8, au, from, the, sun, ceres, appeared, to, fit, the, titius, bode, law, almost, perfectly, when, neptune, was, discovered, in, 1846, eight, au, closer, than, predicted, most, astronomers, concluded, that, the, law, was, a, coincidence, the, early, observers, were, able, to, calculate, the, size, of, ceres, only, to, within, an, order, of, magnitude, herschel, underestimated, its, diameter, at, 260, km, 160, mi, in, 1802, in, 1811, german, astronomer, johann, hieronymus, schr, ter, overestimated, it, as, 2, 613, km, 1, 624, mi, in, the, 1970s, infrared, photometry, enabled, more, accurate, measurements, of, its, albedo, and, ceres, s, diameter, was, determined, to, within, ten, per, cent, of, its, true, value, of, 939, km, 583, mi, piazzi, s, proposed, name, for, his, discovery, was, ceres, ferdinandea, ceres, after, the, roman, goddess, of, agriculture, whose, earthly, home, and, oldest, temple, lay, in, sicily, and, ferdinandea, in, honour, of, piazzi, s, monarch, and, patron, king, ferdinand, iii, of, sicily, the, latter, was, not, acceptable, to, other, nations, and, was, dropped, before, von, zach, s, recovery, of, ceres, in, december, 1801, von, zach, referred, to, the, planet, as, hera, and, bode, referred, to, it, as, juno, despite, piazzi, s, objections, those, names, gained, currency, in, germany, before, the, object, s, existence, was, confirmed, once, it, was, astronomers, settled, on, piazzi, s, name, the, adjectival, forms, of, ceres, are, cererian, and, cererean, both, pronounced, s, r, r, i, n, cerium, a, rare, earth, element, discovered, in, 1803, was, named, after, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, the, old, astronomical, symbol, of, ceres, still, used, in, astrology, is, a, sickle, the, sickle, was, one, of, the, classical, symbols, of, the, goddess, ceres, and, was, suggested, apparently, independently, by, von, zach, and, bode, in, 1802, it, is, similar, in, form, to, the, symbol, a, circle, with, a, small, cross, beneath, of, the, planet, venus, but, with, a, break, in, the, circle, it, had, various, minor, graphic, variants, including, a, reversed, form, typeset, as, a, c, the, initial, letter, of, the, name, ceres, with, a, plus, sign, the, generic, asteroid, symbol, of, a, numbered, disk, was, introduced, in, 1867, and, quickly, became, the, norm, the, categorisation, of, ceres, has, changed, more, than, once, and, has, been, the, subject, of, some, disagreement, bode, believed, ceres, to, be, the, missing, planet, he, had, proposed, to, exist, between, mars, and, jupiter, ceres, was, assigned, a, planetary, symbol, and, remained, listed, as, a, planet, in, astronomy, books, and, tables, along, with, pallas, juno, and, vesta, for, over, half, a, century, as, other, objects, were, discovered, in, the, neighbourhood, of, ceres, astronomers, began, to, suspect, that, it, represented, the, first, of, a, new, class, of, objects, when, pallas, was, discovered, in, 1802, herschel, coined, the, term, asteroid, star, like, for, these, bodies, writing, that, they, resemble, small, stars, so, much, as, hardly, to, be, distinguished, from, them, even, by, very, good, telescopes, in, 1852, johann, franz, encke, in, the, berliner, astronomisches, jahrbuch, declared, the, traditional, system, of, granting, planetary, symbols, too, cumbersome, for, these, new, objects, and, introduced, a, new, method, of, placing, numbers, before, their, names, in, order, of, discovery, the, numbering, system, initially, began, with, the, fifth, asteroid, 5, astraea, as, number, 1, but, in, 1867, ceres, was, adopted, into, the, new, system, under, the, name, 1, ceres, by, the, 1860s, astronomers, widely, accepted, that, a, fundamental, difference, existed, between, the, major, planets, and, asteroids, such, as, ceres, though, the, word, planet, had, yet, to, be, precisely, defined, in, the, 1950s, scientists, generally, stopped, considering, most, asteroids, as, planets, but, ceres, sometimes, retained, its, status, after, that, because, of, its, planet, like, geophysical, complexity, then, in, 2006, the, debate, surrounding, pluto, led, to, calls, for, a, definition, of, planet, and, the, possible, reclassification, of, ceres, perhaps, even, its, general, reinstatement, as, a, planet, a, proposal, before, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, the, global, body, responsible, for, astronomical, nomenclature, and, classification, defined, a, planet, as, a, celestial, body, that, a, has, sufficient, mass, for, its, self, gravity, to, overcome, rigid, body, forces, so, that, it, assumes, a, hydrostatic, equilibrium, nearly, round, shape, and, b, is, in, orbit, around, a, star, and, is, neither, a, star, nor, a, satellite, of, a, planet, had, this, resolution, been, adopted, it, would, have, made, ceres, the, fifth, planet, in, order, from, the, sun, but, on, 24, august, 2006, the, assembly, adopted, the, additional, requirement, that, a, planet, must, have, cleared, the, neighbourhood, around, its, orbit, ceres, is, not, a, planet, because, it, does, not, dominate, its, orbit, sharing, it, as, it, does, with, the, thousands, of, other, asteroids, in, the, asteroid, belt, and, constituting, only, about, forty, per, cent, of, the, belt, s, total, mass, bodies, that, met, the, first, proposed, definition, but, not, the, second, such, as, ceres, were, instead, classified, as, dwarf, planets, planetary, geologists, still, often, ignore, this, definition, and, consider, ceres, to, be, a, planet, anyway, ceres, is, a, dwarf, planet, but, there, is, some, confusion, about, whether, it, is, also, an, asteroid, a, nasa, webpage, states, that, vesta, the, belt, s, second, largest, object, is, the, largest, asteroid, the, iau, has, been, equivocal, on, the, subject, though, its, minor, planet, center, the, organisation, charged, with, cataloguing, such, objects, notes, that, dwarf, planets, may, have, dual, designations, and, the, joint, iau, usgs, nasa, gazetteer, categorises, ceres, as, both, asteroid, and, a, dwarf, planet, ceres, follows, an, orbit, between, mars, and, jupiter, near, the, middle, of, the, asteroid, belt, with, an, orbital, period, year, of, 4, 6, earth, years, compared, to, other, planets, and, dwarf, planets, ceres, s, orbit, is, moderately, tilted, relative, to, that, of, earth, its, inclination, i, is, 10, 6, compared, to, 7, for, mercury, and, 17, for, pluto, it, is, also, slightly, elongated, with, an, eccentricity, e, 0, 08, compared, to, 0, 09, for, mars, ceres, is, not, part, of, an, asteroid, family, probably, due, to, its, large, proportion, of, ice, as, smaller, bodies, with, the, same, composition, would, have, sublimated, to, nothing, over, the, age, of, the, solar, system, it, was, once, thought, to, be, a, member, of, the, gefion, family, the, members, of, which, share, similar, proper, orbital, elements, suggesting, a, common, origin, through, an, asteroid, collision, in, the, past, ceres, was, later, found, to, have, a, different, composition, from, the, gefion, family, and, appears, to, be, an, interloper, having, similar, orbital, elements, but, not, a, common, origin, due, to, their, small, masses, and, large, separations, objects, within, the, asteroid, belt, rarely, fall, into, gravitational, resonances, with, each, other, nevertheless, ceres, is, able, to, capture, other, asteroids, into, temporary, 1, 1, resonances, making, them, temporary, trojans, for, periods, from, a, few, hundred, thousand, to, more, than, two, million, years, fifty, such, objects, have, been, identified, ceres, is, close, to, a, 1, 1, mean, motion, orbital, resonance, with, pallas, their, proper, orbital, periods, differ, by, 0, 2, but, not, close, enough, to, be, significant, over, astronomical, timescales, the, rotation, period, of, ceres, the, cererian, day, is, 9, hours, and, 4, minutes, the, small, equatorial, crater, of, kait, is, selected, as, its, prime, meridian, ceres, has, an, axial, tilt, of, 4, small, enough, for, its, polar, regions, to, contain, permanently, shadowed, craters, that, are, expected, to, act, as, cold, traps, and, accumulate, water, ice, over, time, similar, to, what, occurs, on, the, moon, and, mercury, about, 0, 14, of, water, molecules, released, from, the, surface, are, expected, to, end, up, in, the, traps, hopping, an, average, of, three, times, before, escaping, or, being, trapped, dawn, the, first, spacecraft, to, orbit, ceres, determined, that, the, north, polar, axis, points, at, right, ascension, 19, h, 25, m, 40, 3, s, 291, 418, declination, 66, 45, 50, about, 1, 5, degrees, from, delta, draconis, which, means, an, axial, tilt, of, 4, this, means, that, ceres, currently, sees, little, to, no, seasonal, variation, in, sunlight, by, latitude, gravitational, influence, from, jupiter, and, saturn, over, the, course, of, three, million, years, has, triggered, cyclical, shifts, in, ceres, s, axial, tilt, ranging, from, two, to, twenty, degrees, meaning, that, seasonal, variation, in, sun, exposure, has, occurred, in, the, past, with, the, last, period, of, seasonal, activity, estimated, at, 14, 000, years, ago, those, craters, that, remain, in, shadow, during, periods, of, maximum, axial, tilt, are, the, most, likely, to, retain, water, ice, from, eruptions, or, cometary, impacts, over, the, age, of, the, solar, system, ceres, is, the, largest, asteroid, in, the, main, asteroid, belt, it, has, been, classified, as, a, c, type, or, carbonaceous, asteroid, and, due, to, the, presence, of, clay, minerals, as, a, g, type, asteroid, it, has, a, similar, but, not, identical, composition, to, that, of, carbonaceous, chondrite, meteorites, it, is, an, oblate, spheroid, with, an, equatorial, diameter, 8, larger, than, its, polar, diameter, measurements, from, the, dawn, spacecraft, found, a, mean, diameter, of, 939, 4, km, 583, 7, mi, and, a, mass, of, 9, 38, 10, 20, kg, this, gives, ceres, a, density, of, 2, 16, g, cm, 3, suggesting, that, a, quarter, of, its, mass, is, water, ice, ceres, makes, up, 40, of, the, estimated, 2394, 5, 10, 18, kg, mass, of, the, asteroid, belt, and, it, has, 3, 1, 2, times, the, mass, of, the, next, asteroid, vesta, but, it, is, only, 1, 3, the, mass, of, the, moon, it, is, close, to, being, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, but, some, deviations, from, an, equilibrium, shape, have, yet, to, be, explained, regardless, ceres, is, the, only, widely, accepted, dwarf, planet, with, an, orbital, period, less, than, that, of, neptune, modelling, has, suggested, ceres, s, rocky, material, is, partially, differentiated, and, that, it, may, possess, a, small, core, but, the, data, is, also, consistent, with, a, mantle, of, hydrated, silicates, and, no, core, because, dawn, lacked, a, magnetometer, it, is, not, known, if, ceres, has, a, magnetic, field, it, is, believed, not, to, ceres, s, internal, differentiation, may, be, related, to, its, lack, of, a, natural, satellite, as, satellites, of, main, belt, asteroids, are, mostly, believed, to, form, from, collisional, disruption, creating, an, undifferentiated, rubble, pile, structure, the, surface, composition, of, ceres, is, homogeneous, on, a, global, scale, and, it, is, rich, in, carbonates, and, ammoniated, phyllosilicates, that, have, been, altered, by, water, though, water, ice, in, the, regolith, varies, from, approximately, 10, in, polar, latitudes, to, much, drier, even, ice, free, in, the, equatorial, regions, studies, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, show, graphite, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, on, ceres, s, surface, the, graphite, is, evidently, the, result, of, space, weathering, on, ceres, s, older, surfaces, the, latter, two, are, volatile, under, cererian, conditions, and, would, be, expected, to, either, escape, quickly, or, settle, in, cold, traps, and, so, are, evidently, associated, with, areas, with, relatively, recent, geological, activity, organic, compounds, were, detected, in, ernutet, crater, and, most, of, the, planet, s, near, surface, is, rich, in, carbon, at, approximately, 20, by, mass, the, carbon, content, is, more, than, five, times, higher, than, in, carbonaceous, chondrite, meteorites, analysed, on, earth, the, surface, carbon, shows, evidence, of, being, mixed, with, products, of, rock, water, interactions, such, as, clays, this, chemistry, suggests, ceres, formed, in, a, cold, environment, perhaps, outside, the, orbit, of, jupiter, and, that, it, accreted, from, ultra, carbon, rich, materials, in, the, presence, of, water, which, could, provide, conditions, favourable, to, organic, chemistry, dawn, revealed, that, ceres, has, a, heavily, cratered, surface, though, with, fewer, large, craters, than, expected, models, based, on, the, formation, of, the, current, asteroid, belt, had, predicted, ceres, should, have, ten, to, fifteen, craters, larger, than, 400, km, 250, mi, in, diameter, the, largest, confirmed, crater, on, ceres, kerwan, basin, is, 284, km, 176, mi, across, the, most, likely, reason, for, this, is, viscous, relaxation, of, the, crust, slowly, flattening, out, larger, impacts, ceres, s, north, polar, region, shows, far, more, cratering, than, the, equatorial, region, with, the, eastern, equatorial, region, in, particular, comparatively, lightly, cratered, the, overall, size, frequency, of, craters, of, between, twenty, and, a, hundred, kilometres, 10, 60, mi, is, consistent, with, their, having, originated, in, the, late, heavy, bombardment, with, craters, outside, the, ancient, polar, regions, likely, erased, by, early, cryovolcanism, three, large, shallow, basins, planitiae, with, degraded, rims, are, likely, to, be, eroded, craters, the, largest, vendimia, planitia, at, 800, km, 500, mi, across, is, also, the, largest, single, geographical, feature, on, ceres, two, of, the, three, have, higher, than, average, ammonium, concentrations, dawn, observed, 4, 423, boulders, larger, than, 105, m, 344, ft, in, diameter, on, the, surface, of, ceres, these, boulders, likely, formed, through, impacts, and, are, found, within, or, near, craters, though, not, all, craters, contain, boulders, large, boulders, are, more, numerous, at, higher, latitudes, boulders, on, ceres, are, brittle, and, degrade, rapidly, due, to, thermal, stress, at, dawn, and, dusk, the, surface, temperature, changes, rapidly, and, meteoritic, impacts, their, maximum, age, is, estimated, to, be, 150, million, years, much, shorter, than, the, lifetime, of, boulders, on, vesta, although, ceres, lacks, plate, tectonics, with, the, vast, majority, of, its, surface, features, linked, either, to, impacts, or, to, cryovolcanic, activity, several, potentially, tectonic, features, have, been, tentatively, identified, on, its, surface, particularly, in, its, eastern, hemisphere, the, samhain, catenae, kilometre, scale, linear, fractures, on, ceres, s, surface, lack, any, apparent, link, to, impacts, and, bear, a, stronger, resemblance, to, pit, crater, chains, which, are, indicative, of, buried, normal, faults, also, several, craters, on, ceres, have, shallow, fractured, floors, consistent, with, cryomagmatic, intrusion, ceres, has, one, prominent, mountain, ahuna, mons, this, appears, to, be, a, cryovolcano, and, has, few, craters, suggesting, a, maximum, age, of, 240, million, years, its, relatively, high, gravitational, field, suggests, it, is, dense, and, thus, composed, more, of, rock, than, ice, and, that, its, placement, is, likely, due, to, diapirism, of, a, slurry, of, brine, and, silicate, particles, from, the, top, of, the, mantle, it, is, roughly, antipodal, to, kerwan, basin, seismic, energy, from, the, kerwan, forming, impact, may, have, focused, on, the, opposite, side, of, ceres, fracturing, the, outer, layers, of, the, crust, and, triggering, the, movement, of, high, viscosity, cryomagma, muddy, water, ice, softened, by, its, content, of, salts, onto, the, surface, kerwan, too, shows, evidence, of, the, effects, of, liquid, water, due, to, impact, melting, of, subsurface, ice, a, 2018, computer, simulation, suggests, that, cryovolcanoes, on, ceres, once, formed, recede, due, to, viscous, relaxation, over, several, hundred, million, years, the, team, identified, 22, features, as, strong, candidates, for, relaxed, cryovolcanoes, on, ceres, s, surface, yamor, mons, an, ancient, impact, cratered, peak, resembles, ahuna, mons, despite, being, much, older, due, to, it, lying, in, ceres, s, northern, polar, region, where, lower, temperatures, prevent, viscous, relaxation, of, the, crust, models, suggest, that, over, the, past, billion, years, one, cryovolcano, has, formed, on, ceres, on, average, every, fifty, million, years, the, eruptions, may, be, linked, to, ancient, impact, basins, but, are, not, uniformly, distributed, over, ceres, the, model, suggests, that, contrary, to, findings, at, ahuna, mons, cererian, cryovolcanoes, must, be, composed, of, far, less, dense, material, than, average, for, ceres, s, crust, or, the, observed, viscous, relaxation, could, not, occur, an, unexpectedly, large, number, of, cererian, craters, have, central, pits, perhaps, due, to, cryovolcanic, processes, others, have, central, peaks, hundreds, of, bright, spots, faculae, have, been, observed, by, dawn, the, brightest, in, the, middle, of, 80, km, 50, mi, occator, crater, the, bright, spot, in, the, centre, of, occator, is, named, cerealia, facula, and, the, group, of, bright, spots, to, its, east, vinalia, faculae, occator, possesses, a, pit, 9, 10, km, wide, partially, filled, by, a, central, dome, the, dome, post, dates, the, faculae, and, is, likely, due, to, freezing, of, a, subterranean, reservoir, comparable, to, pingos, in, earth, s, arctic, region, a, haze, periodically, appears, above, cerealia, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, some, sort, of, outgassing, or, sublimating, ice, formed, the, bright, spots, in, march, 2016, dawn, found, definitive, evidence, of, water, ice, on, the, surface, of, ceres, at, oxo, crater, on, 9, december, 2015, nasa, scientists, reported, that, the, bright, spots, on, ceres, may, be, due, to, a, type, of, salt, from, evaporated, brine, containing, magnesium, sulfate, hexahydrate, mgso, 4, 6h, 2, o, the, spots, were, also, found, to, be, associated, with, ammonia, rich, clays, near, infrared, spectra, of, these, bright, areas, were, reported, in, 2017, to, be, consistent, with, a, large, amount, of, sodium, carbonate, na, 2, co, 3, and, smaller, amounts, of, ammonium, chloride, nh, 4, cl, or, ammonium, bicarbonate, nh, 4, hco, 3, these, materials, have, been, suggested, to, originate, from, the, crystallisation, of, brines, that, reached, the, surface, in, august, 2020, nasa, confirmed, that, ceres, was, a, water, rich, body, with, a, deep, reservoir, of, brine, that, percolated, to, the, surface, in, hundreds, of, locations, causing, bright, spots, including, those, in, occator, crater, the, active, geology, of, ceres, is, driven, by, ice, and, brines, water, leached, from, rock, is, estimated, to, possess, a, salinity, of, around, 5, altogether, ceres, is, approximately, 50, water, by, volume, compared, to, 0, 1, for, earth, and, 73, rock, by, mass, ceres, s, largest, craters, are, several, kilometres, deep, inconsistent, with, an, ice, rich, shallow, subsurface, the, fact, that, the, surface, has, preserved, craters, almost, 300, km, 200, mi, in, diameter, indicates, that, the, outermost, layer, of, ceres, is, roughly, 1000, times, stronger, than, water, ice, this, is, consistent, with, a, mixture, of, silicates, hydrated, salts, and, methane, clathrates, with, no, more, than, 30, water, ice, by, volume, gravity, measurements, from, dawn, have, generated, three, competing, models, for, ceres, s, interior, in, the, three, layer, model, ceres, is, thought, to, consist, of, an, outer, 40, km, 25, mi, thick, crust, of, ice, salts, and, hydrated, minerals, and, an, inner, muddy, mantle, of, hydrated, rock, such, as, clays, separated, by, a, 60, km, 37, mi, layer, of, a, muddy, mixture, of, brine, and, rock, it, is, not, possible, to, tell, if, ceres, s, deep, interior, contains, liquid, or, a, core, of, dense, material, rich, in, metal, but, the, low, central, density, suggests, it, may, retain, about, 10, porosity, one, study, estimated, the, densities, of, the, core, and, mantle, crust, to, be, 2, 46, 2, 90, and, 1, 68, 1, 95, g, cm, 3, respectively, with, the, mantle, and, crust, together, being, 70, 190, km, 40, 120, mi, thick, only, partial, dehydration, expulsion, of, ice, from, the, core, is, expected, though, the, high, density, of, the, mantle, relative, to, water, ice, reflects, its, enrichment, in, silicates, and, salts, that, is, the, core, if, it, exists, the, mantle, and, crust, all, consist, of, rock, and, ice, though, in, different, ratios, ceres, s, mineral, composition, can, be, determined, indirectly, only, for, its, outer, 100, km, 60, mi, the, solid, outer, crust, 40, km, 25, mi, thick, is, a, mixture, of, ice, salts, and, hydrated, minerals, under, that, is, a, layer, that, may, contain, a, small, amount, of, brine, this, extends, to, a, depth, of, at, least, the, 100, km, 60, mi, limit, of, detection, under, that, is, thought, to, be, a, mantle, dominated, by, hydrated, rocks, such, as, clays, in, one, two, layer, model, ceres, consists, of, a, core, of, chondrules, and, a, mantle, of, mixed, ice, and, micron, sized, solid, particulates, mud, sublimation, of, ice, at, the, surface, would, leave, a, deposit, of, hydrated, particulates, perhaps, twenty, metres, thick, the, range, of, the, extent, of, differentiation, is, consistent, with, the, data, from, a, large, 360, km, 220, mi, core, of, 75, chondrules, and, 25, particulates, and, a, mantle, of, 75, ice, and, 25, particulates, to, a, small, 85, km, 55, mi, core, consisting, nearly, entirely, of, particulates, and, a, mantle, of, 30, ice, and, 70, particulates, with, a, large, core, the, core, mantle, boundary, should, be, warm, enough, for, pockets, of, brine, with, a, small, core, the, mantle, should, remain, liquid, below, 110, km, 68, mi, in, the, latter, case, a, 2, freezing, of, the, liquid, reservoir, would, compress, the, liquid, enough, to, force, some, to, the, surface, producing, cryovolcanism, a, second, two, layer, model, suggests, a, partial, differentiation, of, ceres, into, a, volatile, rich, crust, and, a, denser, mantle, of, hydrated, silicates, a, range, of, densities, for, the, crust, and, mantle, can, be, calculated, from, the, types, of, meteorite, thought, to, have, impacted, ceres, with, ci, class, meteorites, density, 2, 46, g, cm, 3, the, crust, would, be, approximately, 70, km, 40, mi, thick, and, have, a, density, of, 1, 68, g, cm, 3, with, cm, class, meteorites, density, 2, 9, g, cm, 3, the, crust, would, be, approximately, 190, km, 120, mi, thick, and, have, a, density, of, 1, 9, g, cm, 3, best, fit, modelling, yields, a, crust, approximately, 40, km, 25, mi, thick, with, a, density, of, approximately, 1, 25, g, cm, 3, and, a, mantle, core, density, of, approximately, 2, 4, g, cm, 3, in, 2017, dawn, confirmed, that, ceres, has, a, transient, atmosphere, of, water, vapour, hints, of, an, atmosphere, had, appeared, in, early, 2014, when, the, herschel, space, observatory, detected, localised, mid, latitude, sources, of, water, vapour, on, ceres, no, more, than, 60, km, 40, mi, in, diameter, which, each, give, off, approximately, 10, 26, molecules, 3, kg, of, water, per, second, two, potential, source, regions, designated, piazzi, 123, e, 21, n, and, region, a, 231, e, 23, n, were, visualised, in, the, near, infrared, as, dark, areas, region, a, also, has, a, bright, centre, by, the, keck, observatory, possible, mechanisms, for, the, vapour, release, are, sublimation, from, approximately, 0, 6, km, 2, 0, 2, sq, mi, of, exposed, surface, ice, cryovolcanic, eruptions, resulting, from, radiogenic, internal, heat, or, pressurisation, of, a, subsurface, ocean, due, to, thickening, of, an, overlying, layer, of, ice, in, 2015, david, jewitt, included, ceres, in, his, list, of, active, asteroids, surface, water, ice, is, unstable, at, distances, less, than, 5, au, from, the, sun, so, it, is, expected, to, sublime, if, exposed, directly, to, solar, radiation, proton, emission, from, solar, flares, and, cmes, can, sputter, exposed, ice, patches, on, the, surface, leading, to, a, positive, correlation, between, detections, of, water, vapour, and, solar, activity, water, ice, can, migrate, from, the, deep, layers, of, ceres, to, the, surface, but, it, escapes, in, a, short, time, surface, sublimation, would, be, expected, to, be, lower, when, ceres, is, farther, from, the, sun, in, its, orbit, and, internally, powered, emissions, should, not, be, affected, by, its, orbital, position, the, limited, data, previously, available, suggested, cometary, style, sublimation, but, evidence, from, dawn, suggests, geologic, activity, could, be, at, least, partially, responsible, studies, using, dawn, s, gamma, ray, and, neutron, detector, grand, reveal, that, ceres, accelerates, electrons, from, the, solar, wind, the, most, accepted, hypothesis, is, that, these, electrons, are, being, accelerated, by, collisions, between, the, solar, wind, and, a, tenuous, water, vapour, exosphere, bow, shocks, like, these, could, also, be, explained, by, a, transient, magnetic, field, but, this, is, considered, less, likely, as, the, interior, of, ceres, is, not, thought, to, be, sufficiently, electrically, conductive, ceres, thin, exosphere, is, continuously, replenished, through, exposure, of, water, ice, patches, by, impacts, water, ice, diffusion, through, the, porous, ice, crust, and, proton, sputtering, during, solar, activity, the, rate, of, this, vapour, diffusion, scales, with, grain, size, and, is, heavily, affected, by, a, global, dust, mantle, consisting, of, an, aggregate, of, approximately, 1, micron, particles, exospheric, replenishment, through, sublimation, alone, is, very, small, with, the, current, outgassing, rate, being, only, 0, 003, kg, s, various, models, of, an, extant, exosphere, have, been, attempted, including, ballistic, trajectory, dsmc, and, polar, cap, numerical, models, results, showed, a, water, exosphere, half, life, of, 7, hours, from, the, ballistic, trajectory, model, an, outgassing, rate, of, 6, kg, s, with, an, optically, thin, atmosphere, sustained, for, tens, of, days, using, a, dsmc, model, and, seasonal, polar, caps, formed, from, exosphere, water, delivery, using, the, polar, cap, model, the, mobility, of, water, molecules, within, the, exosphere, is, dominated, by, ballistic, hops, coupled, with, interaction, of, the, surface, however, less, is, known, about, direct, interactions, with, planetary, regoliths, ceres, is, a, surviving, protoplanet, that, formed, 4, 56, billion, years, ago, alongside, pallas, and, vesta, one, of, only, three, remaining, in, the, inner, solar, system, with, the, rest, either, merging, to, form, terrestrial, planets, being, shattered, in, collisions, or, being, ejected, by, jupiter, despite, ceres, s, current, location, its, composition, is, not, consistent, with, having, formed, within, the, asteroid, belt, it, seems, rather, that, it, formed, between, the, orbits, of, jupiter, and, saturn, and, was, deflected, into, the, asteroid, belt, as, jupiter, migrated, outward, the, discovery, of, ammonium, salts, in, occator, crater, supports, an, origin, in, the, outer, solar, system, as, ammonia, is, far, more, abundant, in, that, region, the, early, geological, evolution, of, ceres, was, dependent, on, the, heat, sources, available, during, and, after, its, formation, impact, energy, from, planetesimal, accretion, and, decay, of, radionuclides, possibly, including, short, lived, extinct, radionuclides, such, as, aluminium, 26, these, may, have, been, sufficient, to, allow, ceres, to, differentiate, into, a, rocky, core, and, icy, mantle, or, even, a, liquid, water, ocean, soon, after, its, formation, this, ocean, should, have, left, an, icy, layer, under, the, surface, as, it, froze, the, fact, that, dawn, found, no, evidence, of, such, a, layer, suggests, that, ceres, s, original, crust, was, at, least, partially, destroyed, by, later, impacts, thoroughly, mixing, the, ice, with, the, salts, and, silicate, rich, material, of, the, ancient, seafloor, and, the, material, beneath, ceres, possesses, surprisingly, few, large, craters, suggesting, that, viscous, relaxation, and, cryovolcanism, have, erased, older, geological, features, the, presence, of, clays, and, carbonates, requires, chemical, reactions, at, temperatures, above, 50, c, consistent, with, hydrothermal, activity, it, has, become, considerably, less, geologically, active, over, time, with, a, surface, dominated, by, impact, craters, nevertheless, evidence, from, dawn, reveals, that, internal, processes, have, continued, to, sculpt, ceres, s, surface, to, a, significant, extent, contrary, to, predictions, that, ceres, s, small, size, would, have, ceased, internal, geological, activity, early, in, its, history, although, ceres, is, not, as, actively, discussed, as, a, potential, home, for, microbial, extraterrestrial, life, as, mars, europa, enceladus, or, titan, are, it, has, the, most, water, of, any, body, in, the, inner, solar, system, after, earth, and, the, likely, brine, pockets, under, its, surface, could, provide, habitats, for, life, unlike, europa, or, enceladus, it, does, not, experience, tidal, heating, but, it, is, close, enough, to, the, sun, and, contains, enough, long, lived, radioactive, isotopes, to, preserve, liquid, water, in, its, subsurface, for, extended, periods, the, remote, detection, of, organic, compounds, and, the, presence, of, water, mixed, with, 20, carbon, by, mass, in, its, near, surface, could, provide, conditions, favourable, to, organic, chemistry, of, the, biochemical, elements, ceres, is, rich, in, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and, nitrogen, but, phosphorus, has, yet, to, be, detected, and, sulfur, despite, being, suggested, by, hubble, uv, observations, was, not, detected, by, dawn, when, in, opposition, near, its, perihelion, ceres, can, reach, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 6, 7, this, is, too, dim, to, be, visible, to, the, average, naked, eye, but, under, ideal, viewing, conditions, keen, eyes, may, be, able, to, see, it, vesta, is, the, only, other, asteroid, that, can, regularly, reach, a, similarly, bright, magnitude, while, pallas, and, 7, iris, do, so, only, when, both, in, opposition, and, near, perihelion, when, in, conjunction, ceres, has, a, magnitude, of, around, 9, 3, which, corresponds, to, the, faintest, objects, visible, with, 10, 50, binoculars, thus, it, can, be, seen, with, such, binoculars, in, a, naturally, dark, and, clear, night, sky, around, new, moon, an, occultation, of, the, star, bd, 8, 471, by, ceres, was, observed, on, 13, november, 1984, in, mexico, florida, and, across, the, caribbean, allowing, better, measurements, of, its, size, shape, and, albedo, on, 25, june, 1995, hubble, obtained, ultraviolet, images, of, ceres, with, 50, km, 30, mi, resolution, in, 2002, the, keck, observatory, obtained, infrared, images, with, 30, km, 20, mi, resolution, using, adaptive, optics, before, the, dawn, mission, only, a, few, surface, features, had, been, unambiguously, detected, on, ceres, high, resolution, ultraviolet, hubble, images, in, 1995, showed, a, dark, spot, on, its, surface, which, was, nicknamed, piazzi, in, honour, of, the, discoverer, of, ceres, it, was, thought, to, be, a, crater, visible, light, images, of, a, full, rotation, taken, by, hubble, in, 2003, and, 2004, showed, eleven, recognisable, surface, features, the, natures, of, which, were, undetermined, one, of, them, corresponded, to, the, piazzi, feature, near, infrared, images, over, a, whole, rotation, taken, with, adaptive, optics, by, the, keck, observatory, in, 2012, showed, bright, and, dark, features, moving, with, ceres, s, rotation, two, dark, features, were, circular, and, were, presumed, to, be, craters, one, was, observed, to, have, a, bright, central, region, and, the, other, was, identified, as, the, piazzi, feature, dawn, eventually, revealed, piazzi, to, be, a, dark, region, in, the, middle, of, vendimia, planitia, close, to, the, crater, dantu, and, the, other, dark, feature, to, be, within, hanami, planitia, and, close, to, occator, crater, in, the, early, 1990s, nasa, initiated, the, discovery, program, which, was, intended, to, be, a, series, of, low, cost, scientific, missions, in, 1996, the, program, s, study, team, proposed, a, high, priority, mission, to, explore, the, asteroid, belt, using, a, spacecraft, with, an, ion, engine, funding, remained, problematic, for, nearly, a, decade, but, by, 2004, the, dawn, vehicle, passed, its, critical, design, review, dawn, the, first, space, mission, to, visit, either, vesta, or, ceres, was, launched, on, 27, september, 2007, on, 3, may, 2011, dawn, acquired, its, first, targeting, image, 1, 200, 000, km, 750, 000, mi, from, vesta, after, orbiting, vesta, for, thirteen, months, dawn, used, its, ion, engine, to, depart, for, ceres, with, gravitational, capture, occurring, on, 6, march, 2015, at, a, separation, of, 61, 000, km, 38, 000, mi, four, months, before, the, new, horizons, flyby, of, pluto, the, spacecraft, instrumentation, included, a, framing, camera, a, visual, and, infrared, spectrometer, and, a, gamma, ray, and, neutron, detector, these, instruments, examined, ceres, s, shape, and, elemental, composition, on, 13, january, 2015, as, dawn, approached, ceres, the, spacecraft, took, its, first, images, at, near, hubble, resolution, revealing, impact, craters, and, a, small, high, albedo, spot, on, the, surface, additional, imaging, sessions, at, increasingly, better, resolution, took, place, from, february, to, april, dawn, s, mission, profile, called, for, it, to, study, ceres, from, a, series, of, circular, polar, orbits, at, successively, lower, altitudes, it, entered, its, first, observational, orbit, rc3, around, ceres, at, an, altitude, of, 13, 500, km, 8, 400, mi, on, 23, april, 2015, staying, for, only, one, orbit, 15, days, the, spacecraft, then, reduced, its, orbital, distance, to, 4, 400, km, 2, 700, mi, for, its, second, observational, orbit, survey, for, three, weeks, then, down, to, 1, 470, km, 910, mi, hamo, high, altitude, mapping, orbit, for, two, months, and, then, down, to, its, final, orbit, at, 375, km, 233, mi, lamo, low, altitude, mapping, orbit, for, at, least, three, months, in, october, 2015, nasa, released, a, true, colour, portrait, of, ceres, made, by, dawn, in, 2017, dawn, s, mission, was, extended, to, perform, a, series, of, closer, orbits, around, ceres, until, the, hydrazine, used, to, maintain, its, orbit, ran, out, dawn, soon, discovered, evidence, of, cryovolcanism, two, distinct, bright, spots, or, high, albedo, features, inside, a, crater, different, from, the, bright, spots, observed, in, earlier, hubble, images, were, seen, in, a, 19, february, 2015, image, leading, to, speculation, about, a, possible, cryovolcanic, origin, or, outgassing, on, 2, september, 2016, scientists, from, the, dawn, team, argued, in, a, science, paper, that, ahuna, mons, was, the, strongest, evidence, yet, for, cryovolcanic, features, on, ceres, on, 11, may, 2015, nasa, released, a, higher, resolution, image, showing, that, the, spots, were, composed, of, multiple, smaller, spots, on, 9, december, 2015, nasa, scientists, reported, that, the, bright, spots, on, ceres, may, be, related, to, a, type, of, salt, particularly, a, form, of, brine, containing, magnesium, sulfate, hexahydrate, mgso, 4, 6h, 2, o, the, spots, were, also, found, to, be, associated, with, ammonia, rich, clays, in, june, 2016, near, infrared, spectra, of, these, bright, areas, were, found, to, be, consistent, with, a, large, amount, of, sodium, carbonate, na, 2, co, 3, implying, that, recent, geologic, activity, was, probably, involved, in, the, creation, of, the, bright, spots, from, june, to, october, 2018, dawn, orbited, ceres, from, as, close, as, 35, km, 22, mi, to, as, far, away, as, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, the, dawn, mission, ended, on, 1, november, 2018, after, the, spacecraft, ran, out, of, fuel, in, 2020, an, esa, team, proposed, the, calathus, mission, concept, a, followup, mission, to, occator, crater, to, return, a, sample, of, the, bright, carbonate, faculae, and, dark, organics, to, earth, the, chinese, space, agency, is, designing, a, sample, return,
