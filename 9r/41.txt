the, standard, atmosphere, symbol, atm, is, a, unit, of, pressure, defined, as, 101, 325, pa, it, is, sometimes, used, as, a, reference, pressure, or, standard, pressure, it, is, approximately, equal, to, earth, s, average, atmospheric, pressure, at, sea, level, the, standard, atmosphere, was, originally, defined, as, the, pressure, exerted, by, a, 760, mm, column, of, mercury, at, 0, c, 32, f, and, standard, gravity, g, n, 9, 806, 65, m, s, 2, it, was, used, as, a, reference, condition, for, physical, and, chemical, properties, and, was, implicit, in, the, definition, of, the, celsius, temperature, scale, which, defined, 100, c, 212, f, as, the, boiling, point, of, water, at, this, pressure, in, 1954, the, 10th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, adopted, standard, atmosphere, for, general, use, and, affirmed, its, definition, of, being, precisely, equal, to, 1, 013, 250, dynes, per, square, centimetre, 101, 325, pa, this, defined, pressure, in, a, way, that, is, independent, of, the, properties, of, any, particular, substance, in, addition, the, cgpm, noted, that, there, had, been, some, misapprehension, that, the, previous, definition, from, the, 9th, cgpm, led, some, physicists, to, believe, that, this, definition, of, the, standard, atmosphere, was, valid, only, for, accurate, work, in, thermometry, in, chemistry, and, in, various, industries, the, reference, pressure, referred, to, in, standard, temperature, and, pressure, was, commonly, 1, atm, 101, 325, kpa, prior, to, 1982, but, standards, have, since, diverged, in, 1982, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, recommended, that, for, the, purposes, of, specifying, the, physical, properties, of, substances, standard, pressure, should, be, precisely, 100, kpa, 1, bar, a, pressure, of, 1, atm, can, also, be, stated, as, the, ata, unit, is, used, in, place, of, atm, to, indicate, the, total, pressure, of, the, system, compared, to, a, vacuum, for, example, an, underwater, pressure, of, 3, ata, would, mean, that, this, pressure, includes, 1, atm, of, air, pressure, and, thus, 2, atm, due, to, the, water
