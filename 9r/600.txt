sandstone, is, a, clastic, sedimentary, rock, composed, mainly, of, sand, sized, 0, 0625, to, 2, mm, silicate, grains, cemented, together, by, another, mineral, sandstones, comprise, about, 20, 25, of, all, sedimentary, rocks, most, sandstone, is, composed, of, quartz, or, feldspar, because, they, are, the, most, resistant, minerals, to, the, weathering, processes, at, the, earth, s, surface, like, uncemented, sand, sandstone, may, be, any, color, due, to, impurities, within, the, minerals, but, the, most, common, colors, are, tan, brown, yellow, red, grey, pink, white, and, black, because, sandstone, beds, can, form, highly, visible, cliffs, and, other, topographic, features, certain, colors, of, sandstone, have, become, strongly, identified, with, certain, regions, such, as, the, red, rock, deserts, of, arches, national, park, and, other, areas, of, the, american, southwest, rock, formations, composed, of, sandstone, usually, allow, the, percolation, of, water, and, other, fluids, and, are, porous, enough, to, store, large, quantities, making, them, valuable, aquifers, and, petroleum, reservoirs, quartz, bearing, sandstone, can, be, changed, into, quartzite, through, metamorphism, usually, related, to, tectonic, compression, within, orogenic, belts, sandstones, are, clastic, in, origin, as, opposed, to, either, organic, like, chalk, and, coal, or, chemical, like, gypsum, and, jasper, the, silicate, sand, grains, from, which, they, form, are, the, product, of, physical, and, chemical, weathering, of, bedrock, weathering, and, erosion, are, most, rapid, in, areas, of, high, relief, such, as, volcanic, arcs, areas, of, continental, rifting, and, orogenic, belts, eroded, sand, is, transported, by, rivers, or, by, the, wind, from, its, source, areas, to, depositional, environments, where, tectonics, has, created, accommodation, space, for, sediments, to, accumulate, forearc, basins, tend, to, accumulate, sand, rich, in, lithic, grains, and, plagioclase, intracontinental, basins, and, grabens, along, continental, margins, are, also, common, environments, for, deposition, of, sand, as, sediments, continue, to, accumulate, in, the, depositional, environment, older, sand, is, buried, by, younger, sediments, and, it, undergoes, diagenesis, this, mostly, consists, of, compaction, and, lithification, of, the, sand, early, stages, of, diagenesis, described, as, eogenesis, take, place, at, shallow, depths, a, few, tens, of, meters, and, are, characterized, by, bioturbation, and, mineralogical, changes, in, the, sands, with, only, slight, compaction, the, red, hematite, that, gives, red, bed, sandstones, their, color, is, likely, formed, during, eogenesis, deeper, burial, is, accompanied, by, mesogenesis, during, which, most, of, the, compaction, and, lithification, takes, place, compaction, takes, place, as, the, sand, comes, under, increasing, pressure, from, overlying, sediments, sediment, grains, move, into, more, compact, arrangements, ductile, grains, such, as, mica, grains, are, deformed, and, pore, space, is, reduced, in, addition, to, this, physical, compaction, chemical, compaction, may, take, place, via, pressure, solution, points, of, contact, between, grains, are, under, the, greatest, strain, and, the, strained, mineral, is, more, soluble, than, the, rest, of, the, grain, as, a, result, the, contact, points, are, dissolved, away, allowing, the, grains, to, come, into, closer, contact, lithification, follows, closely, on, compaction, as, increased, temperatures, at, depth, hasten, deposition, of, cement, that, binds, the, grains, together, pressure, solution, contributes, to, cementing, as, the, mineral, dissolved, from, strained, contact, points, is, redeposited, in, the, unstrained, pore, spaces, mechanical, compaction, takes, place, primarily, at, depths, less, than, 1, 000, meters, 3, 300, ft, chemical, compaction, continues, to, depths, of, 2, 000, meters, 6, 600, ft, and, most, cementation, takes, place, at, depths, of, 2, 000, 5, 000, meters, 6, 600, 16, 400, ft, unroofing, of, buried, sandstone, is, accompanied, by, telogenesis, the, third, and, final, stage, of, diagenesis, as, erosion, reduces, the, depth, of, burial, renewed, exposure, to, meteoric, water, produces, additional, changes, to, the, sandstone, such, as, dissolution, of, some, of, the, cement, to, produce, secondary, porosity, framework, grains, are, sand, sized, 0, 0625, to, 2, millimeter, 0, 00246, to, 0, 07874, in, diameter, detrital, fragments, that, make, up, the, bulk, of, a, sandstone, most, framework, grains, are, composed, of, quartz, or, feldspar, which, are, the, common, minerals, most, resistant, to, weathering, processes, at, the, earth, s, surface, as, seen, in, the, goldich, dissolution, series, framework, grains, can, be, classified, into, several, different, categories, based, on, their, mineral, composition, matrix, is, very, fine, material, which, is, present, within, interstitial, pore, space, between, the, framework, grains, the, nature, of, the, matrix, within, the, interstitial, pore, space, results, in, a, twofold, classification, cement, is, what, binds, the, siliciclastic, framework, grains, together, cement, is, a, secondary, mineral, that, forms, after, deposition, and, during, burial, of, the, sandstone, these, cementing, materials, may, be, either, silicate, minerals, or, non, silicate, minerals, such, as, calcite, sandstone, that, becomes, depleted, of, its, cement, binder, through, weathering, gradually, becomes, friable, and, unstable, this, process, can, be, somewhat, reversed, by, the, application, of, tetraethyl, orthosilicate, si, oc, 2, h, 5, 4, which, will, deposit, amorphous, silicon, dioxide, between, the, sand, grains, the, reaction, is, as, follows, pore, space, includes, the, open, spaces, within, a, rock, or, a, soil, the, pore, space, in, a, rock, has, a, direct, relationship, to, the, porosity, and, permeability, of, the, rock, the, porosity, and, permeability, are, directly, influenced, by, the, way, the, sand, grains, are, packed, together, sandstones, are, typically, classified, by, point, counting, a, thin, section, using, a, method, like, the, gazzi, dickinson, method, this, yields, the, relative, percentages, of, quartz, feldspar, and, lithic, grains, and, the, amount, of, clay, matrix, the, composition, of, a, sandstone, can, provide, important, information, on, the, genesis, of, the, sediments, when, used, with, a, triangular, q, uartz, f, eldspar, l, ithic, fragment, qfl, diagrams, however, geologist, have, not, been, able, to, agree, on, a, set, of, boundaries, separating, regions, of, the, qfl, triangle, visual, aids, are, diagrams, that, allow, geologists, to, interpret, different, characteristics, of, a, sandstone, for, example, a, qfl, chart, can, be, marked, with, a, provenance, model, that, shows, the, likely, tectonic, origin, of, sandstones, with, various, compositions, of, framework, grains, likewise, the, stage, of, textural, maturity, chart, illustrates, the, different, stages, that, a, sandstone, goes, through, as, the, degree, of, kinetic, processing, of, the, sediments, increases, dott, s, 1964, sandstone, classification, scheme, is, one, of, many, such, schemes, used, by, geologists, for, classifying, sandstones, dott, s, scheme, is, a, modification, of, gilbert, s, classification, of, silicate, sandstones, and, it, incorporates, r, l, folk, s, dual, textural, and, compositional, maturity, concepts, into, one, classification, system, the, philosophy, behind, combining, gilbert, s, and, r, l, folk, s, schemes, is, that, it, is, better, able, to, portray, the, continuous, nature, of, textural, variation, from, mudstone, to, arenite, and, from, stable, to, unstable, grain, composition, dott, s, classification, scheme, is, based, on, the, mineralogy, of, framework, grains, and, on, the, type, of, matrix, present, in, between, the, framework, grains, in, this, specific, classification, scheme, dott, has, set, the, boundary, between, arenite, and, wackes, at, 15, matrix, in, addition, dott, also, breaks, up, the, different, types, of, framework, grains, that, can, be, present, in, a, sandstone, into, three, major, categories, quartz, feldspar, and, lithic, grains, when, sandstone, is, subjected, to, the, great, heat, and, pressure, associated, with, regional, metamorphism, the, individual, quartz, grains, recrystallize, along, with, the, former, cementing, material, to, form, the, metamorphic, rock, called, quartzite, most, or, all, of, the, original, texture, and, sedimentary, structures, of, the, sandstone, are, erased, by, the, metamorphism, the, grains, are, so, tightly, interlocked, that, when, the, rock, is, broken, it, fractures, through, the, grains, to, form, an, irregular, or, conchoidal, fracture, geologists, had, recognized, by, 1941, that, some, rocks, show, the, macroscopic, characteristics, of, quartzite, even, though, they, have, not, undergone, metamorphism, at, high, pressure, and, temperature, these, rocks, have, been, subject, only, to, the, much, lower, temperatures, and, pressures, associated, with, diagenesis, of, sedimentary, rock, but, diagenesis, has, cemented, the, rock, so, thoroughly, that, microscopic, examination, is, necessary, to, distinguish, it, from, metamorphic, quartzite, the, term, orthoquartzite, is, used, to, distinguish, such, sedimentary, rock, from, metaquartzite, produced, by, metamorphism, by, extension, the, term, orthoquartzite, has, occasionally, been, more, generally, applied, to, any, quartz, cemented, quartz, arenite, orthoquartzite, in, the, narrow, sense, is, often, 99, sio, 2, with, only, very, minor, amounts, of, iron, oxide, and, trace, resistant, minerals, such, as, zircon, rutile, and, magnetite, although, few, fossils, are, normally, present, the, original, texture, and, sedimentary, structures, are, preserved, the, typical, distinction, between, a, true, orthoquartzite, and, an, ordinary, quartz, sandstone, is, that, an, orthoquartzite, is, so, highly, cemented, that, it, will, fracture, across, grains, not, around, them, this, is, a, distinction, that, can, be, recognized, in, the, field, in, turn, the, distinction, between, an, orthoquartzite, and, a, metaquartzite, is, the, onset, of, recrystallization, of, existing, grains, the, dividing, line, may, be, placed, at, the, point, where, strained, quartz, grains, begin, to, be, replaced, by, new, unstrained, small, quartz, grains, producing, a, mortar, texture, that, can, be, identified, in, thin, sections, under, a, polarizing, microscope, with, increasing, grade, of, metamorphism, further, recrystallization, produces, foam, texture, characterized, by, polygonal, grains, meeting, at, triple, junctions, and, then, porphyroblastic, texture, characterized, by, coarse, irregular, grains, including, some, larger, grains, porphyroblasts, sandstone, has, been, used, since, prehistoric, times, for, construction, decorative, art, works, and, tools, it, has, been, widely, employed, around, the, world, in, constructing, temples, churches, homes, and, other, buildings, and, in, civil, engineering, although, its, resistance, to, weathering, varies, sandstone, is, easy, to, work, that, makes, it, a, common, building, and, paving, material, including, in, asphalt, concrete, however, some, types, that, have, been, used, in, the, past, such, as, the, collyhurst, sandstone, used, in, north, west, england, have, had, poor, long, term, weather, resistance, necessitating, repair, and, replacement, in, older, buildings, because, of, the, hardness, of, individual, grains, uniformity, of, grain, size, and, friability, of, their, structure, some, types, of, sandstone, are, excellent, materials, from, which, to, make, grindstones, for, sharpening, blades, and, other, implements, non, friable, sandstone, can, be, used, to, make, grindstones, for, grinding, grain, e, g, gritstone, a, type, of, pure, quartz, sandstone, orthoquartzite, with, more, of, 90, 95, percent, of, quartz, has, been, proposed, for, nomination, to, the, global, heritage, stone, resource, in, some, regions, of, argentina, the, orthoquartzite, stoned, facade, is, one, of, the, main, features, of, the, mar, del, plata, style, bungalows
