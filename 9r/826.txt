ionizing, radiation, us, ionising, radiation, in, the, uk, including, nuclear, radiation, consists, of, subatomic, particles, or, electromagnetic, waves, that, have, sufficient, energy, to, ionize, atoms, or, molecules, by, detaching, electrons, from, them, some, particles, can, travel, up, to, 99, of, the, speed, of, light, and, the, electromagnetic, waves, are, on, the, high, energy, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, gamma, rays, x, rays, and, the, higher, energy, ultraviolet, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, are, ionizing, radiation, whereas, the, lower, energy, ultraviolet, visible, light, nearly, all, types, of, laser, light, infrared, microwaves, and, radio, waves, are, non, ionizing, radiation, the, boundary, between, ionizing, and, non, ionizing, radiation, in, the, ultraviolet, area, cannot, be, sharply, defined, as, different, molecules, and, atoms, ionize, at, different, energies, the, energy, of, ionizing, radiation, starts, between, 10, electronvolts, ev, and, 33, ev, ionizing, subatomic, particles, include, alpha, particles, beta, particles, and, neutrons, these, particles, are, created, by, radioactive, decay, and, almost, all, are, energetic, enough, to, ionize, there, are, also, secondary, cosmic, particles, produced, after, cosmic, rays, interact, with, earth, s, atmosphere, including, muons, mesons, and, positrons, cosmic, rays, may, also, produce, radioisotopes, on, earth, for, example, carbon, 14, which, in, turn, decay, and, emit, ionizing, radiation, cosmic, rays, and, the, decay, of, radioactive, isotopes, are, the, primary, sources, of, natural, ionizing, radiation, on, earth, contributing, to, background, radiation, ionizing, radiation, is, also, generated, artificially, by, x, ray, tubes, particle, accelerators, and, nuclear, fission, ionizing, radiation, is, not, immediately, detectable, by, human, senses, so, instruments, such, as, geiger, counters, are, used, to, detect, and, measure, it, however, very, high, energy, particles, can, produce, visible, effects, on, both, organic, and, inorganic, matter, e, g, water, lighting, in, cherenkov, radiation, or, humans, e, g, acute, radiation, syndrome, ionizing, radiation, is, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, such, as, medicine, nuclear, power, research, and, industrial, manufacturing, but, presents, a, health, hazard, if, proper, measures, against, excessive, exposure, are, not, taken, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, causes, cell, damage, to, living, tissue, and, organ, damage, in, high, acute, doses, it, will, result, in, radiation, burns, and, radiation, sickness, and, lower, level, doses, over, a, protracted, time, can, cause, cancer, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, icrp, issues, guidance, on, ionizing, radiation, protection, and, the, effects, of, dose, uptake, on, human, health, ionizing, radiation, may, be, grouped, as, directly, or, indirectly, ionizing, any, charged, particle, with, mass, can, ionize, atoms, directly, by, fundamental, interaction, through, the, coulomb, force, if, it, carries, sufficient, kinetic, energy, such, particles, include, atomic, nuclei, electrons, muons, charged, pions, protons, and, energetic, charged, nuclei, stripped, of, their, electrons, when, moving, at, relativistic, speeds, near, the, speed, of, light, c, these, particles, have, enough, kinetic, energy, to, be, ionizing, but, there, is, considerable, speed, variation, for, example, a, typical, alpha, particle, moves, at, about, 5, of, c, but, an, electron, with, 33, ev, just, enough, to, ionize, moves, at, about, 1, of, c, two, of, the, first, types, of, directly, ionizing, radiation, to, be, discovered, are, alpha, particles, which, are, helium, nuclei, ejected, from, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, during, radioactive, decay, and, energetic, electrons, which, are, called, beta, particles, natural, cosmic, rays, are, made, up, primarily, of, relativistic, protons, but, also, include, heavier, atomic, nuclei, like, helium, ions, and, hze, ions, in, the, atmosphere, such, particles, are, often, stopped, by, air, molecules, and, this, produces, short, lived, charged, pions, which, soon, decay, to, muons, a, primary, type, of, cosmic, ray, radiation, that, reaches, the, surface, of, the, earth, pions, can, also, be, produced, in, large, amounts, in, particle, accelerators, alpha, particles, consist, of, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, bound, together, into, a, particle, identical, to, a, helium, nucleus, alpha, particle, emissions, are, generally, produced, in, the, process, of, alpha, decay, alpha, particles, are, a, strongly, ionizing, form, of, radiation, but, when, emitted, by, radioactive, decay, they, have, low, penetration, power, and, can, be, absorbed, by, a, few, centimeters, of, air, or, by, the, top, layer, of, human, skin, more, powerful, alpha, particles, from, ternary, fission, are, three, times, as, energetic, and, penetrate, proportionately, farther, in, air, the, helium, nuclei, that, form, 10, 12, of, cosmic, rays, are, also, usually, of, much, higher, energy, than, those, produced, by, radioactive, decay, and, pose, shielding, problems, in, space, however, this, type, of, radiation, is, significantly, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, which, is, a, radiation, shield, equivalent, to, about, 10, meters, of, water, the, alpha, particle, was, named, by, ernest, rutherford, after, the, first, letter, in, the, greek, alphabet, when, he, ranked, the, known, radioactive, emissions, in, descending, order, of, ionising, effect, in, 1899, the, symbol, is, or, 2, because, they, are, identical, to, helium, nuclei, they, are, also, sometimes, written, as, he, 2, or, 4, 2, he, 2, indicating, a, helium, ion, with, a, 2, charge, missing, its, two, electrons, if, the, ion, gains, electrons, from, its, environment, the, alpha, particle, can, be, written, as, a, normal, electrically, neutral, helium, atom, 4, 2, he, beta, particles, are, high, energy, high, speed, electrons, or, positrons, emitted, by, certain, types, of, radioactive, nuclei, such, as, potassium, 40, the, production, of, beta, particles, is, termed, beta, decay, they, are, designated, by, the, greek, letter, beta, there, are, two, forms, of, beta, decay, and, which, respectively, give, rise, to, the, electron, and, the, positron, beta, particles, are, much, less, penetrating, than, gamma, radiation, but, more, penetrating, than, alpha, particles, high, energy, beta, particles, may, produce, x, rays, known, as, bremsstrahlung, braking, radiation, or, secondary, electrons, delta, ray, as, they, pass, through, matter, both, of, these, can, cause, an, indirect, ionization, effect, bremsstrahlung, is, of, concern, when, shielding, beta, emitters, as, the, interaction, of, beta, particles, with, some, shielding, materials, produces, bremsstrahlung, the, effect, is, greater, with, material, having, high, atomic, numbers, so, material, with, low, atomic, numbers, is, used, for, beta, source, shielding, the, positron, or, antielectron, is, the, antiparticle, or, the, antimatter, counterpart, of, the, electron, when, a, low, energy, positron, collides, with, a, low, energy, electron, annihilation, occurs, resulting, in, their, conversion, into, the, energy, of, two, or, more, gamma, ray, photons, see, electron, positron, annihilation, as, positrons, are, positively, charged, particles, they, can, directly, ionize, an, atom, through, coulomb, interactions, positrons, can, be, generated, by, positron, emission, nuclear, decay, through, weak, interactions, or, by, pair, production, from, a, sufficiently, energetic, photon, positrons, are, common, artificial, sources, of, ionizing, radiation, used, in, medical, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scans, charged, nuclei, are, characteristic, of, galactic, cosmic, rays, and, solar, particle, events, and, except, for, alpha, particles, charged, helium, nuclei, have, no, natural, sources, on, earth, in, space, however, very, high, energy, protons, helium, nuclei, and, hze, ions, can, be, initially, stopped, by, relatively, thin, layers, of, shielding, clothes, or, skin, however, the, resulting, interaction, will, generate, secondary, radiation, and, cause, cascading, biological, effects, if, just, one, atom, of, tissue, is, displaced, by, an, energetic, proton, for, example, the, collision, will, cause, further, interactions, in, the, body, this, is, called, linear, energy, transfer, let, which, utilizes, elastic, scattering, let, can, be, visualized, as, a, billiard, ball, hitting, another, in, the, manner, of, the, conservation, of, momentum, sending, both, away, with, the, energy, of, the, first, ball, divided, between, the, two, unequally, when, a, charged, nucleus, strikes, a, relatively, slow, moving, nucleus, of, an, object, in, space, let, occurs, and, neutrons, alpha, particles, low, energy, protons, and, other, nuclei, will, be, released, by, the, collisions, and, contribute, to, the, total, absorbed, dose, of, tissue, indirectly, ionizing, radiation, is, electrically, neutral, and, does, not, interact, strongly, with, matter, therefore, the, bulk, of, the, ionization, effects, are, due, to, secondary, ionization, even, though, photons, are, electrically, neutral, they, can, ionize, atoms, indirectly, through, the, photoelectric, effect, and, the, compton, effect, either, of, those, interactions, will, cause, the, ejection, of, an, electron, from, an, atom, at, relativistic, speeds, turning, that, electron, into, a, beta, particle, secondary, beta, particle, that, will, ionize, other, atoms, since, most, of, the, ionized, atoms, are, due, to, the, secondary, beta, particles, photons, are, indirectly, ionizing, radiation, radiated, photons, are, called, gamma, rays, if, they, are, produced, by, a, nuclear, reaction, subatomic, particle, decay, or, radioactive, decay, within, the, nucleus, they, are, called, x, rays, if, produced, outside, the, nucleus, the, generic, term, photon, is, used, to, describe, both, x, rays, normally, have, a, lower, energy, than, gamma, rays, and, an, older, convention, was, to, define, the, boundary, as, a, wavelength, of, 10, 11, m, or, a, photon, energy, of, 100, kev, that, threshold, was, driven, by, historic, limitations, of, older, x, ray, tubes, and, low, awareness, of, isomeric, transitions, modern, technologies, and, discoveries, have, shown, an, overlap, between, x, ray, and, gamma, energies, in, many, fields, they, are, functionally, identical, differing, for, terrestrial, studies, only, in, origin, of, the, radiation, in, astronomy, however, where, radiation, origin, often, cannot, be, reliably, determined, the, old, energy, division, has, been, preserved, with, x, rays, defined, as, being, between, about, 120, ev, and, 120, kev, and, gamma, rays, as, being, of, any, energy, above, 100, to, 120, kev, regardless, of, source, most, astronomical, gamma, ray, astronomy, are, known, not, to, originate, in, nuclear, radioactive, processes, but, rather, result, from, processes, like, those, that, produce, astronomical, x, rays, except, driven, by, much, more, energetic, electrons, photoelectric, absorption, is, the, dominant, mechanism, in, organic, materials, for, photon, energies, below, 100, kev, typical, of, classical, x, ray, tube, originated, x, rays, at, energies, beyond, 100, kev, photons, ionize, matter, increasingly, through, the, compton, effect, and, then, indirectly, through, pair, production, at, energies, beyond, 5, mev, the, accompanying, interaction, diagram, shows, two, compton, scatterings, happening, sequentially, in, every, scattering, event, the, gamma, ray, transfers, energy, to, an, electron, and, it, continues, on, its, path, in, a, different, direction, and, with, reduced, energy, the, lowest, ionization, energy, of, any, element, is, 3, 89, ev, for, caesium, however, us, federal, communications, commission, material, defines, ionizing, radiation, as, that, with, a, photon, energy, greater, than, 10, ev, equivalent, to, a, far, ultraviolet, wavelength, of, 124, nanometers, roughly, this, corresponds, to, both, the, first, ionization, energy, of, oxygen, and, the, ionization, energy, of, hydrogen, both, about, 14, ev, in, some, environmental, protection, agency, references, the, ionization, of, a, typical, water, molecule, at, an, energy, of, 33, ev, is, referenced, as, the, appropriate, biological, threshold, for, ionizing, radiation, this, value, represents, the, so, called, w, value, the, colloquial, name, for, the, icru, s, mean, energy, expended, in, a, gas, per, ion, pair, formed, which, combines, ionization, energy, plus, the, energy, lost, to, other, processes, such, as, excitation, at, 38, nanometers, wavelength, for, electromagnetic, radiation, 33, ev, is, close, to, the, energy, at, the, conventional, 10, nm, wavelength, transition, between, extreme, ultraviolet, and, x, ray, radiation, which, occurs, at, about, 125, ev, thus, x, ray, radiation, is, always, ionizing, but, only, extreme, ultraviolet, radiation, can, be, considered, ionizing, under, all, definitions, neutrons, have, a, neutral, electrical, charge, often, misunderstood, as, zero, electrical, charge, and, thus, often, do, not, directly, cause, ionization, in, a, single, step, or, interaction, with, matter, however, fast, neutrons, will, interact, with, the, protons, in, hydrogen, via, linear, energy, transfer, energy, that, a, particle, transfers, to, the, material, it, is, moving, through, this, mechanism, scatters, the, nuclei, of, the, materials, in, the, target, area, causing, direct, ionization, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, when, neutrons, strike, the, hydrogen, nuclei, proton, radiation, fast, protons, results, these, protons, are, themselves, ionizing, because, they, are, of, high, energy, are, charged, and, interact, with, the, electrons, in, matter, neutrons, that, strike, other, nuclei, besides, hydrogen, will, transfer, less, energy, to, the, other, particle, if, linear, energy, transfer, does, occur, but, for, many, nuclei, struck, by, neutrons, inelastic, scattering, occurs, whether, elastic, or, inelastic, scatter, occurs, is, dependent, on, the, speed, of, the, neutron, whether, fast, or, thermal, or, somewhere, in, between, it, is, also, dependent, on, the, nuclei, it, strikes, and, its, neutron, cross, section, in, inelastic, scattering, neutrons, are, readily, absorbed, in, a, type, of, nuclear, reaction, called, neutron, capture, and, attributes, to, the, neutron, activation, of, the, nucleus, neutron, interactions, with, most, types, of, matter, in, this, manner, usually, produce, radioactive, nuclei, the, abundant, oxygen, 16, nucleus, for, example, undergoes, neutron, activation, rapidly, decays, by, a, proton, emission, forming, nitrogen, 16, which, decays, to, oxygen, 16, the, short, lived, nitrogen, 16, decay, emits, a, powerful, beta, ray, this, process, can, be, written, as, 16, o, n, p, 16, n, fast, neutron, capture, possible, with, 11, mev, neutron, 16, n, 16, o, decay, t, 1, 2, 7, 13, s, this, high, energy, further, interacts, rapidly, with, other, nuclei, emitting, high, energy, via, bremsstrahlung, while, not, a, favorable, reaction, the, 16, o, n, p, 16, n, reaction, is, a, major, source, of, x, rays, emitted, from, the, cooling, water, of, a, pressurized, water, reactor, and, contributes, enormously, to, the, radiation, generated, by, a, water, cooled, nuclear, reactor, while, operating, for, the, best, shielding, of, neutrons, hydrocarbons, that, have, an, abundance, of, hydrogen, are, used, in, fissile, materials, secondary, neutrons, may, produce, nuclear, chain, reactions, causing, a, larger, amount, of, ionization, from, the, daughter, products, of, fission, outside, the, nucleus, free, neutrons, are, unstable, and, have, a, mean, lifetime, of, 14, minutes, 42, seconds, free, neutrons, decay, by, emission, of, an, electron, and, an, electron, antineutrino, to, become, a, proton, a, process, known, as, beta, decay, in, the, adjacent, diagram, a, neutron, collides, with, a, proton, of, the, target, material, and, then, becomes, a, fast, recoil, proton, that, ionizes, in, turn, at, the, end, of, its, path, the, neutron, is, captured, by, a, nucleus, in, an, n, reaction, that, leads, to, the, emission, of, a, neutron, capture, photon, such, photons, always, have, enough, energy, to, qualify, as, ionizing, radiation, neutron, radiation, alpha, radiation, and, extremely, energetic, gamma, 20, mev, can, cause, nuclear, transmutation, and, induced, radioactivity, the, relevant, mechanisms, are, neutron, activation, alpha, absorption, and, photodisintegration, a, large, enough, number, of, transmutations, can, change, macroscopic, properties, and, cause, targets, to, become, radioactive, themselves, even, after, the, original, source, is, removed, ionization, of, molecules, can, lead, to, radiolysis, breaking, chemical, bonds, and, formation, of, highly, reactive, free, radicals, these, free, radicals, may, then, react, chemically, with, neighbouring, materials, even, after, the, original, radiation, has, stopped, e, g, ozone, cracking, of, polymers, by, ozone, formed, by, ionization, of, air, ionizing, radiation, can, also, accelerate, existing, chemical, reactions, such, as, polymerization, and, corrosion, by, contributing, to, the, activation, energy, required, for, the, reaction, optical, materials, deteriorate, under, the, effect, of, ionizing, radiation, high, intensity, ionizing, radiation, in, air, can, produce, a, visible, ionized, air, glow, of, telltale, bluish, purple, color, the, glow, can, be, observed, e, g, during, criticality, accidents, around, mushroom, clouds, shortly, after, a, nuclear, explosion, or, the, inside, of, a, damaged, nuclear, reactor, like, during, the, chernobyl, disaster, monatomic, fluids, e, g, molten, sodium, have, no, chemical, bonds, to, break, and, no, crystal, lattice, to, disturb, so, they, are, immune, to, the, chemical, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, simple, diatomic, compounds, with, very, negative, enthalpy, of, formation, such, as, hydrogen, fluoride, will, reform, rapidly, and, spontaneously, after, ionization, the, ionization, of, materials, temporarily, increases, their, conductivity, potentially, permitting, damaging, current, levels, this, is, a, particular, hazard, in, semiconductor, microelectronics, employed, in, electronic, equipment, with, subsequent, currents, introducing, operation, errors, or, even, permanently, damaging, the, devices, devices, intended, for, high, radiation, environments, such, as, the, nuclear, industry, and, extra, atmospheric, space, applications, may, be, made, radiation, hard, to, resist, such, effects, through, design, material, selection, and, fabrication, methods, proton, radiation, found, in, space, can, also, cause, single, event, upsets, in, digital, circuits, the, electrical, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, are, exploited, in, gas, filled, radiation, detectors, e, g, the, geiger, muller, counter, or, the, ion, chamber, most, adverse, health, effects, of, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, may, be, grouped, in, two, general, categories, the, most, common, impact, is, stochastic, induction, of, cancer, with, a, latent, period, of, years, or, decades, after, exposure, for, example, ionizing, radiation, is, one, cause, of, chronic, myelogenous, leukemia, although, most, people, with, cml, have, not, been, exposed, to, radiation, the, mechanism, by, which, this, occurs, is, well, understood, but, quantitative, models, predicting, the, level, of, risk, remain, controversial, the, most, widely, accepted, model, the, linear, no, threshold, model, lnt, holds, that, the, incidence, of, cancers, due, to, ionizing, radiation, increases, linearly, with, effective, radiation, dose, at, a, rate, of, 5, 5, per, sievert, if, this, is, correct, then, natural, background, radiation, is, the, most, hazardous, source, of, radiation, to, general, public, health, followed, by, medical, imaging, as, a, close, second, other, stochastic, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, are, teratogenesis, cognitive, decline, and, heart, disease, although, dna, is, always, susceptible, to, damage, by, ionizing, radiation, the, dna, molecule, may, also, be, damaged, by, radiation, with, enough, energy, to, excite, certain, molecular, bonds, to, form, pyrimidine, dimers, this, energy, may, be, less, than, ionizing, but, near, to, it, a, good, example, is, ultraviolet, spectrum, energy, which, begins, at, about, 3, 1, ev, 400, nm, at, close, to, the, same, energy, level, which, can, cause, sunburn, to, unprotected, skin, as, a, result, of, photoreactions, in, collagen, and, in, the, uv, b, range, also, damage, in, dna, for, example, pyrimidine, dimers, thus, the, mid, and, lower, ultraviolet, electromagnetic, spectrum, is, damaging, to, biological, tissues, as, a, result, of, electronic, excitation, in, molecules, which, falls, short, of, ionization, but, produces, similar, non, thermal, effects, to, some, extent, visible, light, and, also, ultraviolet, a, uva, which, is, closest, to, visible, energies, have, been, proven, to, result, in, formation, of, reactive, oxygen, species, in, skin, which, cause, indirect, damage, since, these, are, electronically, excited, molecules, which, can, inflict, reactive, damage, although, they, do, not, cause, sunburn, erythema, like, ionization, damage, all, these, effects, in, skin, are, beyond, those, produced, by, simple, thermal, effects, the, table, below, shows, radiation, and, dose, quantities, in, si, and, non, si, units, ionizing, radiation, has, many, industrial, military, and, medical, uses, its, usefulness, must, be, balanced, with, its, hazards, a, compromise, that, has, shifted, over, time, for, example, at, one, time, assistants, in, shoe, shops, in, the, us, used, x, rays, to, check, a, child, s, shoe, size, but, this, practice, was, halted, when, the, risks, of, ionizing, radiation, were, better, understood, neutron, radiation, is, essential, to, the, working, of, nuclear, reactors, and, nuclear, weapons, the, penetrating, power, of, x, ray, gamma, beta, and, positron, radiation, is, used, for, medical, imaging, nondestructive, testing, and, a, variety, of, industrial, gauges, radioactive, tracers, are, used, in, medical, and, industrial, applications, as, well, as, biological, and, radiation, chemistry, alpha, radiation, is, used, in, static, eliminators, and, smoke, detectors, the, sterilizing, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, are, useful, for, cleaning, medical, instruments, food, irradiation, and, the, sterile, insect, technique, measurements, of, carbon, 14, can, be, used, to, date, the, remains, of, long, dead, organisms, such, as, wood, that, is, thousands, of, years, old, ionizing, radiation, is, generated, through, nuclear, reactions, nuclear, decay, by, very, high, temperature, or, via, acceleration, of, charged, particles, in, electromagnetic, fields, natural, sources, include, the, sun, lightning, and, supernova, explosions, artificial, sources, include, nuclear, reactors, particle, accelerators, and, x, ray, tubes, the, united, nations, scientific, committee, on, the, effects, of, atomic, radiation, unscear, itemized, types, of, human, exposures, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, manages, the, international, system, of, radiological, protection, which, sets, recommended, limits, for, dose, uptake, background, radiation, comes, from, both, natural, and, human, made, sources, the, global, average, exposure, of, humans, to, ionizing, radiation, is, about, 3, msv, 0, 3, rem, per, year, 80, of, which, comes, from, nature, the, remaining, 20, results, from, exposure, to, human, made, radiation, sources, primarily, from, medical, imaging, average, human, made, exposure, is, much, higher, in, developed, countries, mostly, due, to, ct, scans, and, nuclear, medicine, natural, background, radiation, comes, from, five, primary, sources, cosmic, radiation, solar, radiation, external, terrestrial, sources, radiation, in, the, human, body, and, radon, the, background, rate, for, natural, radiation, varies, considerably, with, location, being, as, low, as, 1, 5, msv, a, 1, 5, msv, per, year, in, some, areas, and, over, 100, msv, a, in, others, the, highest, level, of, purely, natural, radiation, recorded, on, the, earth, s, surface, is, 90, gy, h, 0, 8, gy, a, on, a, brazilian, black, beach, composed, of, monazite, the, highest, background, radiation, in, an, inhabited, area, is, found, in, ramsar, primarily, due, to, naturally, radioactive, limestone, used, as, a, building, material, some, 2000, of, the, most, exposed, residents, receive, an, average, radiation, dose, of, 10, mgy, per, year, 1, rad, yr, ten, times, more, than, the, icrp, recommended, limit, for, exposure, to, the, public, from, artificial, sources, record, levels, were, found, in, a, house, where, the, effective, radiation, dose, due, to, external, radiation, was, 135, msv, a, 13, 5, rem, yr, and, the, committed, dose, from, radon, was, 640, msv, a, 64, 0, rem, yr, this, unique, case, is, over, 200, times, higher, than, the, world, average, background, radiation, despite, the, high, levels, of, background, radiation, that, the, residents, of, ramsar, receive, there, is, no, compelling, evidence, that, they, experience, a, greater, health, risk, the, icrp, recommendations, are, conservative, limits, and, may, represent, an, over, representation, of, the, actual, health, risk, generally, radiation, safety, organization, recommend, the, most, conservative, limits, assuming, it, is, best, to, err, on, the, side, of, caution, this, level, of, caution, is, appropriate, but, should, not, be, used, to, create, fear, about, background, radiation, danger, radiation, danger, from, background, radiation, may, be, a, serious, threat, but, is, more, likely, a, small, overall, risk, compared, to, all, other, factors, in, the, environment, the, earth, and, all, living, things, on, it, are, constantly, bombarded, by, radiation, from, outside, our, solar, system, this, cosmic, radiation, consists, of, relativistic, particles, positively, charged, nuclei, ions, from, 1, amu, protons, about, 85, of, it, to, 26, amu, iron, nuclei, and, even, beyond, the, high, atomic, number, particles, are, called, hze, ions, the, energy, of, this, radiation, can, far, exceed, that, which, humans, can, create, even, in, the, largest, particle, accelerators, see, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, ray, this, radiation, interacts, in, the, atmosphere, to, create, secondary, radiation, that, rains, down, including, x, rays, muons, protons, antiprotons, alpha, particles, pions, electrons, positrons, and, neutrons, the, dose, from, cosmic, radiation, is, largely, from, muons, neutrons, and, electrons, with, a, dose, rate, that, varies, in, different, parts, of, the, world, and, based, largely, on, the, geomagnetic, field, altitude, and, solar, cycle, the, cosmic, radiation, dose, rate, on, airplanes, is, so, high, that, according, to, the, united, nations, unscear, 2000, report, see, links, at, bottom, airline, flight, crew, workers, receive, more, dose, on, average, than, any, other, worker, including, those, in, nuclear, power, plants, airline, crews, receive, more, cosmic, rays, if, they, routinely, work, flight, routes, that, take, them, close, to, the, north, or, south, pole, at, high, altitudes, where, this, type, of, radiation, is, maximal, cosmic, rays, also, include, high, energy, gamma, rays, which, are, far, beyond, the, energies, produced, by, solar, or, human, sources, most, materials, on, earth, contain, some, radioactive, atoms, even, if, in, small, quantities, most, of, the, dose, received, from, these, sources, is, from, gamma, ray, emitters, in, building, materials, or, rocks, and, soil, when, outside, the, major, radionuclides, of, concern, for, terrestrial, radiation, are, isotopes, of, potassium, uranium, and, thorium, each, of, these, sources, has, been, decreasing, in, activity, since, the, formation, of, the, earth, all, earthly, materials, that, are, the, building, blocks, of, life, contain, a, radioactive, component, as, humans, plants, and, animals, consume, food, air, and, water, an, inventory, of, radioisotopes, builds, up, within, the, organism, see, banana, equivalent, dose, some, radionuclides, like, potassium, 40, emit, a, high, energy, gamma, ray, that, can, be, measured, by, sensitive, electronic, radiation, measurement, systems, these, internal, radiation, sources, contribute, to, an, individual, s, total, radiation, dose, from, natural, background, radiation, an, important, source, of, natural, radiation, is, radon, gas, which, seeps, continuously, from, bedrock, but, can, because, of, its, high, density, accumulate, in, poorly, ventilated, houses, radon, 222, is, a, gas, produced, by, the, decay, of, radium, 226, both, are, a, part, of, the, natural, uranium, decay, chain, uranium, is, found, in, soil, throughout, the, world, in, varying, concentrations, radon, is, the, largest, cause, of, lung, cancer, among, non, smokers, and, the, second, leading, cause, overall, there, are, three, standard, ways, to, limit, exposure, these, can, all, be, applied, to, natural, and, human, made, sources, for, human, made, sources, the, use, of, containment, is, a, major, tool, in, reducing, dose, uptake, and, is, effectively, a, combination, of, shielding, and, isolation, from, the, open, environment, radioactive, materials, are, confined, in, the, smallest, possible, space, and, kept, out, of, the, environment, such, as, in, a, hot, cell, for, radiation, or, glove, box, for, contamination, radioactive, isotopes, for, medical, use, for, example, are, dispensed, in, closed, handling, facilities, usually, gloveboxes, while, nuclear, reactors, operate, within, closed, systems, with, multiple, barriers, that, keep, the, radioactive, materials, contained, work, rooms, hot, cells, and, gloveboxes, have, slightly, reduced, air, pressures, to, prevent, escape, of, airborne, material, to, the, open, environment, in, nuclear, conflicts, or, civil, nuclear, releases, civil, defense, measures, can, help, reduce, exposure, of, populations, by, reducing, ingestion, of, isotopes, and, occupational, exposure, one, is, the, issue, of, potassium, iodide, ki, tablets, which, blocks, the, uptake, of, radioactive, iodine, one, of, the, major, radioisotope, products, of, nuclear, fission, into, the, human, thyroid, gland, occupationally, exposed, individuals, are, controlled, within, the, regulatory, framework, of, the, country, they, work, in, and, in, accordance, with, any, local, nuclear, licence, constraints, these, are, usually, based, on, the, recommendations, of, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, the, icrp, recommends, limiting, artificial, irradiation, for, occupational, exposure, the, limit, is, 50, msv, in, a, single, year, with, a, maximum, of, 100, msv, in, a, consecutive, five, year, period, the, radiation, exposure, of, these, individuals, is, carefully, monitored, with, the, use, of, dosimeters, and, other, radiological, protection, instruments, which, will, measure, radioactive, particulate, concentrations, area, gamma, dose, readings, and, radioactive, contamination, a, legal, record, of, dose, is, kept, examples, of, activities, where, occupational, exposure, is, a, concern, include, some, human, made, radiation, sources, affect, the, body, through, direct, radiation, known, as, effective, dose, radiation, while, others, take, the, form, of, radioactive, contamination, and, irradiate, the, body, from, within, the, latter, is, known, as, committed, dose, medical, procedures, such, as, diagnostic, x, rays, nuclear, medicine, and, radiation, therapy, are, by, far, the, most, significant, source, of, human, made, radiation, exposure, to, the, general, public, some, of, the, major, radionuclides, used, are, i, 131, tc, 99m, co, 60, ir, 192, and, cs, 137, the, public, is, also, exposed, to, radiation, from, consumer, products, such, as, tobacco, polonium, 210, combustible, fuels, gas, coal, etc, televisions, luminous, watches, and, dials, tritium, airport, x, ray, systems, smoke, detectors, americium, electron, tubes, and, gas, lantern, mantles, thorium, of, lesser, magnitude, members, of, the, public, are, exposed, to, radiation, from, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, which, includes, the, entire, sequence, from, processing, uranium, to, the, disposal, of, the, spent, fuel, the, effects, of, such, exposure, have, not, been, reliably, measured, due, to, the, extremely, low, doses, involved, opponents, use, a, cancer, per, dose, model, to, assert, that, such, activities, cause, several, hundred, cases, of, cancer, per, year, an, application, of, the, widely, accepted, linear, no, threshold, model, lnt, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, recommends, limiting, artificial, irradiation, to, the, public, to, an, average, of, 1, msv, 0, 001, sv, of, effective, dose, per, year, not, including, medical, and, occupational, exposures, in, a, nuclear, war, gamma, rays, from, both, the, initial, weapon, explosion, and, fallout, would, be, the, sources, of, radiation, exposure, massive, particles, are, a, concern, for, astronauts, outside, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, who, would, receive, solar, particles, from, solar, proton, events, spe, and, galactic, cosmic, rays, from, cosmic, sources, these, high, energy, charged, nuclei, are, blocked, by, earth, s, magnetic, field, but, pose, a, major, health, concern, for, astronauts, traveling, to, the, moon, and, to, any, distant, location, beyond, the, earth, orbit, highly, charged, hze, ions, in, particular, are, known, to, be, extremely, damaging, although, protons, make, up, the, vast, majority, of, galactic, cosmic, rays, evidence, indicates, past, spe, radiation, levels, that, would, have, been, lethal, for, unprotected, astronauts, air, travel, exposes, people, on, aircraft, to, increased, radiation, from, space, as, compared, to, sea, level, including, cosmic, rays, and, from, solar, flare, events, software, programs, such, as, epcard, cari, sievert, pcaire, are, attempts, to, simulate, exposure, by, aircrews, and, passengers, an, example, of, a, measured, dose, not, simulated, dose, is, 6, sv, per, hour, from, london, heathrow, to, tokyo, narita, on, a, high, latitude, polar, route, however, dosages, can, vary, such, as, during, periods, of, high, solar, activity, the, united, states, faa, requires, airlines, to, provide, flight, crew, with, information, about, cosmic, radiation, and, an, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, recommendation, for, the, general, public, is, no, more, than, 1, msv, per, year, in, addition, many, airlines, do, not, allow, pregnant, flightcrew, members, to, comply, with, a, european, directive, the, faa, has, a, recommended, limit, of, 1, msv, total, for, a, pregnancy, and, no, more, than, 0, 5, msv, per, month, information, originally, based, on, fundamentals, of, aerospace, medicine, published, in, 2008, hazardous, levels, of, ionizing, radiation, are, signified, by, the, trefoil, sign, on, a, yellow, background, these, are, usually, posted, at, the, boundary, of, a, radiation, controlled, area, or, in, any, place, where, radiation, levels, are, significantly, above, background, due, to, human, intervention, the, red, ionizing, radiation, warning, symbol, iso, 21482, was, launched, in, 2007, and, is, intended, for, iaea, category, 1, 2, and, 3, sources, defined, as, dangerous, sources, capable, of, death, or, serious, injury, including, food, irradiators, teletherapy, machines, for, cancer, treatment, and, industrial, radiography, units, the, symbol, is, to, be, placed, on, the, device, housing, the, source, as, a, warning, not, to, dismantle, the, device, or, to, get, any, closer, it, will, not, be, visible, under, normal, use, only, if, someone, attempts, to, disassemble, the, device, the,
