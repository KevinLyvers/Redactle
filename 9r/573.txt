kaolinite, k, e, l, n, a, t, l, kay, l, nyte, lih, also, called, kaolin, is, a, clay, mineral, with, the, chemical, composition, al, 2, si, 2, o, 5, oh, 4, it, is, a, layered, silicate, mineral, with, one, tetrahedral, sheet, of, silica, sio, 4, linked, through, oxygen, atoms, to, one, octahedral, sheet, of, alumina, alo, 6, kaolinite, is, a, soft, earthy, usually, white, mineral, dioctahedral, phyllosilicate, clay, produced, by, the, chemical, weathering, of, aluminium, silicate, minerals, like, feldspar, it, has, a, low, shrink, swell, capacity, and, a, low, cation, exchange, capacity, 1, 15, meq, 100, g, rocks, that, are, rich, in, kaolinite, and, halloysite, are, known, as, kaolin, k, e, l, n, or, china, clay, in, many, parts, of, the, world, kaolin, is, colored, pink, orange, red, by, iron, oxide, giving, it, a, distinct, rust, hue, lower, concentrations, of, iron, oxide, yield, the, white, yellow, or, light, orange, colors, of, kaolin, alternating, lighter, and, darker, layers, are, sometimes, found, as, at, providence, canyon, state, park, in, georgia, united, states, kaolin, is, an, important, raw, material, in, many, industries, and, applications, commercial, grades, of, kaolin, are, supplied, and, transported, as, powder, lumps, semi, dried, noodle, or, slurry, global, production, of, kaolin, in, 2021, was, estimated, to, be, 45, million, tonnes, with, a, total, market, value, of, us4, 24, billion, the, english, name, kaolin, was, borrowed, in, 1727, from, fran, ois, xavier, d, entrecolles, s, 1712, french, reports, on, the, manufacture, of, jingdezhen, porcelain, d, entrecolles, was, transcribing, the, chinese, term, now, romanized, as, g, ol, ngt, in, pinyin, taken, from, the, name, of, the, village, of, gaoling, high, ridge, near, ehu, in, fuliang, county, now, part, of, jiangxi, province, s, jingdezhen, prefecture, the, area, around, the, village, had, become, the, main, source, of, jingdezhen, s, kaolin, over, the, course, of, the, qing, dynasty, the, mineralogical, suffix, ite, was, later, added, to, generalize, the, name, to, cover, nearly, identical, minerals, from, other, locations, kaolinite, is, also, occasionally, discussed, under, the, archaic, names, lithomarge, and, lithomarga, from, latin, lithomarga, a, combination, of, litho, greek, l, thos, stone, and, marga, marl, in, more, proper, modern, use, lithomarge, now, refers, specifically, to, a, compacted, and, massive, form, of, kaolin, the, chemical, formula, for, kaolinite, as, written, in, mineralogy, is, al, 2, si, 2, o, 5, oh, 4, however, in, ceramics, applications, the, same, formula, is, typically, written, in, terms, of, oxides, thus, giving, al, 2, o, 3, 2sio, 2, 2h, 2, o, compared, with, other, clay, minerals, kaolinite, is, chemically, and, structurally, simple, it, is, described, as, a, 1, 1, or, to, clay, mineral, because, its, crystals, consist, of, stacked, to, layers, each, to, layer, consists, of, a, tetrahedral, t, sheet, composed, of, silicon, and, oxygen, ions, bonded, to, an, octahedral, o, sheet, composed, of, oxygen, aluminium, and, hydroxyl, ions, the, t, sheet, is, so, called, because, each, silicon, ion, is, surrounded, by, four, oxygen, ions, forming, a, tetrahedron, the, o, sheet, is, so, called, because, each, aluminium, ion, is, surrounded, by, six, oxygen, or, hydroxyl, ions, arranged, at, the, corners, of, an, octahedron, the, two, sheets, in, each, layer, are, strongly, bonded, together, via, shared, oxygen, ions, while, layers, are, bonded, via, hydrogen, bonding, between, oxygen, on, the, outer, face, of, the, t, sheet, of, one, layer, and, hydroxyl, on, the, outer, face, of, the, o, sheet, of, the, next, layer, a, kaolinite, layer, has, no, net, electrical, charge, and, so, there, are, no, large, cations, such, as, calcium, sodium, or, potassium, between, layers, as, with, most, other, clay, minerals, this, accounts, for, kaolinite, s, relatively, low, ion, exchange, capacity, the, close, hydrogen, bonding, between, layers, also, hinders, water, molecules, from, infiltrating, between, layers, accounting, for, kaolinite, s, nonswelling, character, when, moistened, the, tiny, platelike, crystals, of, kaolinite, acquire, a, layer, of, water, molecules, that, cause, crystals, to, adhere, to, each, other, and, give, kaolin, clay, its, cohesiveness, the, bonds, are, weak, enough, to, allow, the, plates, to, slip, past, each, other, when, the, clay, is, being, molded, but, strong, enough, to, hold, the, plates, in, place, and, allow, the, molded, clay, to, retain, its, shape, when, the, clay, is, dried, most, of, the, water, molecules, are, removed, and, the, plates, hydrogen, bond, directly, to, each, other, so, that, the, dried, clay, is, rigid, but, still, fragile, if, the, clay, is, moistened, again, it, will, once, more, become, plastic, kaolinite, group, clays, undergo, a, series, of, phase, transformations, upon, thermal, treatment, in, air, at, atmospheric, pressure, high, energy, milling, of, kaolin, results, in, the, formation, of, a, mechanochemically, amorphized, phase, similar, to, metakaolin, although, the, properties, of, this, solid, are, quite, different, the, high, energy, milling, process, is, highly, inefficient, and, consumes, a, large, amount, of, energy, below, 100, c, exposure, to, low, humidity, air, will, result, in, the, slow, evaporation, of, any, liquid, water, in, the, kaolin, at, low, moisture, content, the, mass, can, be, described, leather, dry, and, at, near, 0, moisture, it, is, referred, to, as, bone, dry, above, 100, c, any, remaining, free, water, is, lost, above, around, 400, c, hydroxyl, ions, oh, are, lost, from, the, kaolinite, crystal, structure, in, the, form, of, water, the, material, cannot, now, be, plasticised, by, absorbing, water, this, is, irreversible, as, are, subsequent, transformations, this, is, referred, to, as, calcination, endothermic, dehydration, of, kaolinite, begins, at, 550, 600, c, producing, disordered, metakaolin, but, continuous, hydroxyl, loss, is, observed, up, to, 900, c, 1, 650, f, although, historically, there, was, much, disagreement, concerning, the, nature, of, the, metakaolin, phase, extensive, research, has, led, to, a, general, consensus, that, metakaolin, is, not, a, simple, mixture, of, amorphous, silica, sio, 2, and, alumina, al, 2, o, 3, but, rather, a, complex, amorphous, structure, that, retains, some, longer, range, order, but, not, strictly, crystalline, due, to, stacking, of, its, hexagonal, layers, further, heating, to, 925, 950, c, converts, metakaolin, to, an, aluminium, silicon, spinel, which, is, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, a, gamma, alumina, type, structure, upon, calcination, above, 1050, c, the, spinel, phase, nucleates, and, transforms, to, platelet, mullite, and, highly, crystalline, cristobalite, finally, at, 1400, c, the, needle, form, of, mullite, appears, offering, substantial, increases, in, structural, strength, and, heat, resistance, this, is, a, structural, but, not, chemical, transformation, see, stoneware, for, more, information, on, this, form, kaolinite, is, one, of, the, most, common, minerals, it, is, mined, as, kaolin, in, australia, brazil, bulgaria, china, czech, republic, france, germany, india, iran, malaysia, south, africa, south, korea, spain, tanzania, thailand, united, kingdom, united, states, and, vietnam, mantles, of, kaolinite, are, common, in, western, and, northern, europe, the, ages, of, these, mantles, are, mesozoic, to, early, cenozoic, kaolinite, clay, occurs, in, abundance, in, soils, that, have, formed, from, the, chemical, weathering, of, rocks, in, hot, moist, climates, for, example, in, tropical, rainforest, areas, comparing, soils, along, a, gradient, towards, progressively, cooler, or, drier, climates, the, proportion, of, kaolinite, decreases, while, the, proportion, of, other, clay, minerals, such, as, illite, in, cooler, climates, or, smectite, in, drier, climates, increases, such, climatically, related, differences, in, clay, mineral, content, are, often, used, to, infer, changes, in, climates, in, the, geological, past, where, ancient, soils, have, been, buried, and, preserved, in, the, institut, national, pour, l, tude, agronomique, au, congo, belge, ineac, classification, system, soils, in, which, the, clay, fraction, is, predominantly, kaolinite, are, called, kaolisol, from, kaolin, and, soil, in, the, us, the, main, kaolin, deposits, are, found, in, central, georgia, on, a, stretch, of, the, atlantic, seaboard, fall, line, between, augusta, and, macon, this, area, of, thirteen, counties, is, called, the, white, gold, belt, sandersville, is, known, as, the, kaolin, capital, of, the, world, due, to, its, abundance, of, kaolin, in, the, late, 1800s, an, active, kaolin, surface, mining, industry, existed, in, the, extreme, southeast, corner, of, pennsylvania, near, the, towns, of, landenberg, and, kaolin, and, in, what, is, present, day, white, clay, creek, preserve, the, product, was, brought, by, train, to, newark, delaware, on, the, newark, pomeroy, line, along, which, can, still, be, seen, many, open, pit, clay, mines, the, deposits, were, formed, between, the, late, cretaceous, and, early, paleogene, about, 100, to, 45, million, years, ago, in, sediments, derived, from, weathered, igneous, and, metakaolin, rocks, kaolin, production, in, the, us, during, 2011, was, 5, 5, million, tons, during, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, sediments, deposited, in, the, esplugafreda, area, of, spain, were, enriched, with, kaolinite, from, a, detrital, source, due, to, denudation, difficulties, are, encountered, when, trying, to, explain, kaolinite, formation, under, atmospheric, conditions, by, extrapolation, of, thermodynamic, data, from, the, more, successful, high, temperature, syntheses, la, iglesia, and, van, oosterwijk, gastuche, 1978, thought, that, the, conditions, under, which, kaolinite, will, nucleate, can, be, deduced, from, stability, diagrams, based, as, they, are, on, dissolution, data, because, of, a, lack, of, convincing, results, in, their, own, experiments, la, iglesia, and, van, oosterwijk, gastuche, 1978, had, to, conclude, however, that, there, were, other, still, unknown, factors, involved, in, the, low, temperature, nucleation, of, kaolinite, because, of, the, observed, very, slow, crystallization, rates, of, kaolinite, from, solution, at, room, temperature, fripiat, and, herbillon, 1971, postulated, the, existence, of, high, activation, energies, in, the, low, temperature, nucleation, of, kaolinite, at, high, temperatures, equilibrium, thermodynamic, models, appear, to, be, satisfactory, for, the, description, of, kaolinite, dissolution, and, nucleation, because, the, thermal, energy, suffices, to, overcome, the, energy, barriers, involved, in, the, nucleation, process, the, importance, of, syntheses, at, ambient, temperature, and, atmospheric, pressure, towards, the, understanding, of, the, mechanism, involved, in, the, nucleation, of, clay, minerals, lies, in, overcoming, these, energy, barriers, as, indicated, by, caill, re, and, h, nin, 1960, the, processes, involved, will, have, to, be, studied, in, well, defined, experiments, because, it, is, virtually, impossible, to, isolate, the, factors, involved, by, mere, deduction, from, complex, natural, physico, chemical, systems, such, as, the, soil, environment, fripiat, and, herbillon, 1971, in, a, review, on, the, formation, of, kaolinite, raised, the, fundamental, question, how, a, disordered, material, i, e, the, amorphous, fraction, of, tropical, soils, could, ever, be, transformed, into, a, corresponding, ordered, structure, this, transformation, seems, to, take, place, in, soils, without, major, changes, in, the, environment, in, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, and, at, ambient, temperature, and, pressure, low, temperature, synthesis, of, clay, minerals, with, kaolinite, as, an, example, has, several, aspects, in, the, first, place, the, silicic, acid, to, be, supplied, to, the, growing, crystal, must, be, in, a, monomeric, form, i, e, silica, should, be, present, in, very, dilute, solution, caill, re, et, al, 1957, caill, re, and, h, nin, 1960, wey, and, siffert, 1962, millot, 1970, in, order, to, prevent, the, formation, of, amorphous, silica, gels, precipitating, from, supersaturated, solutions, without, reacting, with, the, aluminium, or, magnesium, cations, to, form, crystalline, silicates, the, silicic, acid, must, be, present, in, concentrations, below, the, maximum, solubility, of, amorphous, silica, the, principle, behind, this, prerequisite, can, be, found, in, structural, chemistry, since, the, polysilicate, ions, are, not, of, uniform, size, they, cannot, arrange, themselves, along, with, the, metal, ions, into, a, regular, crystal, lattice, iler, 1955, p, 182, the, second, aspect, of, the, low, temperature, synthesis, of, kaolinite, is, that, the, aluminium, cations, must, be, hexacoordinated, with, respect, to, oxygen, caill, re, and, h, nin, 1947, caill, re, et, al, 1953, h, nin, and, robichet, 1955, gastuche, et, al, 1962, and, caill, re, and, h, nin, 1962, have, concluded, that, kaolinite, can, only, ever, be, formed, when, the, aluminium, hydroxide, is, in, the, form, of, gibbsite, otherwise, the, precipitate, formed, will, be, a, mixed, alumino, silicic, gel, as, millot, 1970, p, 343, put, it, if, it, were, the, only, requirement, large, amounts, of, kaolinite, could, be, harvested, simply, by, adding, gibbsite, powder, to, a, silica, solution, undoubtedly, a, marked, degree, of, adsorption, of, the, silica, in, solution, by, the, gibbsite, surfaces, will, take, place, but, as, stated, before, mere, adsorption, does, not, create, the, layer, lattice, typical, of, kaolinite, crystals, the, third, aspect, is, that, these, two, initial, components, must, be, incorporated, into, one, mixed, crystal, with, a, layer, structure, from, the, following, equation, as, given, by, gastuche, and, dekimpe, 1962, for, kaolinite, formation, it, can, be, seen, that, five, molecules, of, water, must, be, removed, from, the, reaction, for, every, molecule, of, kaolinite, formed, field, evidence, illustrating, the, importance, of, the, removal, of, water, from, the, kaolinite, reaction, has, been, supplied, by, gastuche, and, dekimpe, 1962, while, studying, soil, formation, on, a, basaltic, rock, in, kivu, za, re, they, noted, how, the, occurrence, of, kaolinite, depended, on, the, degr, e, de, drainage, of, the, area, involved, a, clear, distinction, was, found, between, areas, with, good, drainage, i, e, areas, with, a, marked, difference, between, wet, and, dry, seasons, and, those, areas, with, poor, drainage, i, e, perennially, swampy, areas, kaolinite, was, only, found, in, the, areas, with, distinct, seasonal, alternations, between, wet, and, dry, the, possible, significance, of, alternating, wet, and, dry, conditions, on, the, transition, of, allophane, into, kaolinite, has, been, stressed, by, tamura, and, jackson, 1953, the, role, of, alternations, between, wetting, and, drying, on, the, formation, of, kaolinite, has, also, been, noted, by, moore, 1964, syntheses, of, kaolinite, at, high, temperatures, more, than, 100, c, are, relatively, well, known, there, are, for, example, the, syntheses, of, van, nieuwenberg, and, pieters, 1929, noll, 1934, noll, 1936, norton, 1939, roy, and, osborn, 1954, roy, 1961, hawkins, and, roy, 1962, tomura, et, al, 1985, satokawa, et, al, 1994, and, huertas, et, al, 1999, relatively, few, low, temperature, syntheses, have, become, known, cf, brindley, and, dekimpe, 1961, dekimpe, 1969, bogatyrev, et, al, 1997, laboratory, syntheses, of, kaolinite, at, room, temperature, and, atmospheric, pressure, have, been, described, by, dekimpe, et, al, 1961, from, those, tests, the, role, of, periodicity, becomes, convincingly, clear, dekimpe, et, al, 1961, had, used, daily, additions, of, alumina, as, alcl, 3, 6, h, 2, o, and, silica, in, the, form, of, ethyl, silicate, during, at, least, two, months, in, addition, adjustments, of, the, ph, took, place, every, day, by, way, of, adding, either, hydrochloric, acid, or, sodium, hydroxide, such, daily, additions, of, si, and, al, to, the, solution, in, combination, with, the, daily, titrations, with, hydrochloric, acid, or, sodium, hydroxide, during, at, least, 60, days, will, have, introduced, the, necessary, element, of, periodicity, only, now, the, actual, role, of, what, has, been, described, as, the, aging, alterung, of, amorphous, alumino, silicates, as, for, example, harder, 1978, had, noted, can, be, fully, understood, as, such, time, is, not, bringing, about, any, change, in, a, closed, system, at, equilibrium, but, a, series, of, alternations, of, periodically, changing, conditions, by, definition, taking, place, in, an, open, system, will, bring, about, the, low, temperature, formation, of, more, and, more, of, the, stable, phase, kaolinite, instead, of, ill, defined, amorphous, alumino, silicates, in, 2009, up, to, 70, of, kaolin, was, used, in, the, production, of, paper, following, reduced, demand, from, the, paper, industry, resulting, from, both, competing, minerals, and, the, effect, of, digital, media, in, 2016, the, market, share, was, reported, to, be, paper, 36, ceramics, 31, paint, 7, and, other, 26, according, to, the, usgs, in, 2021, the, global, production, of, kaolin, was, estimated, to, be, around, 45, million, tonnes, global, production, of, kaolin, by, country, in, 2012, was, estimated, to, be, some, selected, typical, properties, of, various, ceramic, grade, kaolins, are, kaolin, is, generally, recognized, as, safe, but, may, cause, mild, irritation, of, the, skin, or, mucous, membranes, kaolin, products, may, also, contain, traces, of, crystalline, silica, a, known, carcinogen, if, inhaled, in, the, us, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, kaolin, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 15, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 10, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, twa, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday
