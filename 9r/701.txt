taiga, or, tayga, t, a, ty, g, russian, also, known, as, boreal, forest, or, snow, forest, is, a, biome, characterized, by, coniferous, forests, consisting, mostly, of, pines, spruces, and, larches, the, taiga, or, boreal, forest, is, the, world, s, largest, land, biome, in, north, america, it, covers, most, of, inland, canada, alaska, and, parts, of, the, northern, contiguous, united, states, in, eurasia, it, covers, most, of, sweden, finland, much, of, russia, from, karelia, in, the, west, to, the, pacific, ocean, including, much, of, siberia, much, of, norway, and, estonia, some, of, the, scottish, highlands, some, lowland, coastal, areas, of, iceland, and, areas, of, northern, kazakhstan, northern, mongolia, and, northern, japan, on, the, island, of, hokkaid, the, principal, tree, species, depending, on, the, length, of, the, growing, season, and, summer, temperatures, vary, across, the, world, the, taiga, of, north, america, is, mostly, spruce, scandinavian, and, finnish, taiga, consists, of, a, mix, of, spruce, pines, and, birch, russian, taiga, has, spruces, pines, and, larches, depending, on, the, region, and, the, eastern, siberian, taiga, is, a, vast, larch, forest, taiga, in, its, current, form, is, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, having, only, existed, for, the, last, 12, 000, years, since, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, epoch, covering, land, that, had, been, mammoth, steppe, or, under, the, scandinavian, ice, sheet, in, eurasia, and, under, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, in, north, america, during, the, late, pleistocene, although, at, high, elevations, taiga, grades, into, alpine, tundra, through, krummholz, it, is, not, exclusively, an, alpine, biome, and, unlike, subalpine, forest, much, of, taiga, is, lowlands, the, term, taiga, is, not, used, consistently, by, all, cultures, in, the, english, language, boreal, forest, is, used, in, the, united, states, and, canada, in, referring, to, more, southerly, regions, while, taiga, is, used, to, describe, the, more, northern, barren, areas, approaching, the, tree, line, and, the, tundra, hoffman, 1958, discusses, the, origin, of, this, differential, use, in, north, america, and, how, this, differentiation, distorts, established, russian, usage, climate, change, is, a, threat, to, taiga, and, how, the, carbon, dioxide, absorbed, or, emitted, should, be, treated, by, carbon, accounting, is, controversial, taiga, covers, 17, million, square, kilometres, 6, 6, million, square, miles, or, 11, 5, of, the, earth, s, land, area, second, only, to, deserts, and, xeric, shrublands, the, largest, areas, are, located, in, russia, and, canada, in, sweden, taiga, is, associated, with, the, norrland, terrain, after, the, permanent, ice, caps, and, tundra, taiga, is, the, terrestrial, biome, with, the, lowest, annual, average, temperatures, with, mean, annual, temperature, generally, varying, from, 5, to, 5, c, 23, to, 41, f, extreme, winter, minimums, in, the, northern, taiga, are, typically, lower, than, those, of, the, tundra, there, are, taiga, areas, of, eastern, siberia, and, interior, alaska, yukon, where, the, mean, annual, temperature, reaches, down, to, 10, c, 14, f, and, the, lowest, reliably, recorded, temperatures, in, the, northern, hemisphere, were, recorded, in, the, taiga, of, northeastern, russia, taiga, has, a, subarctic, climate, with, very, large, temperature, range, between, seasons, 20, c, 4, f, would, be, a, typical, winter, day, temperature, and, 18, c, 64, f, an, average, summer, day, but, the, long, cold, winter, is, the, dominant, feature, this, climate, is, classified, as, dfc, dwc, dsc, dfd, and, dwd, in, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, scheme, meaning, that, the, short, summers, 24, h, average, 10, c, 50, f, or, more, although, generally, warm, and, humid, only, last, 1, 3, months, while, winters, with, average, temperatures, below, freezing, last, 5, 7, months, in, siberian, taiga, the, average, temperature, of, the, coldest, month, is, between, 6, c, 21, f, and, 50, c, 58, f, there, are, also, some, much, smaller, areas, grading, towards, the, oceanic, cfc, climate, with, milder, winters, whilst, the, extreme, south, and, in, eurasia, west, of, the, taiga, reaches, into, humid, continental, climates, dfb, dwb, with, longer, summers, according, to, some, sources, the, boreal, forest, grades, into, a, temperate, mixed, forest, when, mean, annual, temperature, reaches, about, 3, c, 37, f, discontinuous, permafrost, is, found, in, areas, with, mean, annual, temperature, below, freezing, whilst, in, the, dfd, and, dwd, climate, zones, continuous, permafrost, occurs, and, restricts, growth, to, very, shallow, rooted, trees, like, siberian, larch, the, growing, season, when, the, vegetation, in, the, taiga, comes, alive, is, usually, slightly, longer, than, the, climatic, definition, of, summer, as, the, plants, of, the, boreal, biome, have, a, lower, temperature, threshold, to, trigger, growth, than, other, plants, some, sources, claim, 130, days, growing, season, as, typical, for, the, taiga, in, canada, and, scandinavia, the, growing, season, is, often, estimated, by, using, the, period, of, the, year, when, the, 24, hour, average, temperature, is, 5, c, 41, f, or, more, for, the, taiga, plains, in, canada, growing, season, varies, from, 80, to, 150, days, and, in, the, taiga, shield, from, 100, to, 140, days, other, sources, define, growing, season, by, frost, free, days, data, for, locations, in, southwest, yukon, gives, 80, 120, frost, free, days, the, closed, canopy, boreal, forest, in, kenozersky, national, park, near, plesetsk, arkhangelsk, province, russia, on, average, has, 108, frost, free, days, the, longest, growing, season, is, found, in, the, smaller, areas, with, oceanic, influences, in, coastal, areas, of, scandinavia, and, finland, the, growing, season, of, the, closed, boreal, forest, can, be, 145, 180, days, the, shortest, growing, season, is, found, at, the, northern, taiga, tundra, ecotone, where, the, northern, taiga, forest, no, longer, can, grow, and, the, tundra, dominates, the, landscape, when, the, growing, season, is, down, to, 50, 70, days, and, the, 24, hr, average, of, the, warmest, month, of, the, year, usually, is, 10, c, 50, f, or, less, high, latitudes, mean, that, the, sun, does, not, rise, far, above, the, horizon, and, less, solar, energy, is, received, than, further, south, but, the, high, latitude, also, ensures, very, long, summer, days, as, the, sun, stays, above, the, horizon, nearly, 20, hours, each, day, or, up, to, 24, hours, with, only, around, 6, hours, of, daylight, or, none, occurring, in, the, dark, winters, depending, on, latitude, the, areas, of, the, taiga, inside, the, arctic, circle, have, midnight, sun, in, mid, summer, and, polar, night, in, mid, winter, the, taiga, experiences, relatively, low, precipitation, throughout, the, year, generally, 200, 750, mm, 7, 9, 29, 5, in, annually, 1, 000, mm, 39, in, in, some, areas, primarily, as, rain, during, the, summer, months, but, also, as, snow, or, fog, snow, may, remain, on, the, ground, for, as, long, as, nine, months, in, the, northernmost, extensions, of, the, taiga, biome, the, fog, especially, predominant, in, low, lying, areas, during, and, after, the, thawing, of, frozen, arctic, seas, stops, sunshine, from, getting, through, to, plants, even, during, the, long, summer, days, as, evaporation, is, consequently, low, for, most, of, the, year, annual, precipitation, exceeds, evaporation, and, is, sufficient, to, sustain, the, dense, vegetation, growth, including, large, trees, this, explains, the, striking, difference, in, biomass, per, square, metre, between, the, taiga, and, the, steppe, biomes, in, warmer, climates, where, evapotranspiration, exceeds, precipitation, restricting, vegetation, to, mostly, grasses, in, general, taiga, grows, to, the, south, of, the, 10, c, 50, f, july, isotherm, occasionally, as, far, north, as, the, 9, c, 48, f, july, isotherm, with, the, southern, limit, more, variable, depending, on, rainfall, and, taiga, may, be, replaced, by, forest, steppe, south, of, the, 15, c, 59, f, july, isotherm, where, rainfall, is, very, low, but, more, typically, extends, south, to, the, 18, c, 64, f, july, isotherm, and, locally, where, rainfall, is, higher, such, as, in, eastern, siberia, and, adjacent, outer, manchuria, south, to, the, 20, c, 68, f, july, isotherm, in, these, warmer, areas, the, taiga, has, higher, species, diversity, with, more, warmth, loving, species, such, as, korean, pine, jezo, spruce, and, manchurian, fir, and, merges, gradually, into, mixed, temperate, forest, or, more, locally, on, the, pacific, ocean, coasts, of, north, america, and, asia, into, coniferous, temperate, rainforests, where, oak, and, hornbeam, appear, and, join, the, conifers, birch, and, populus, tremula, the, area, currently, classified, as, taiga, in, europe, and, north, america, except, alaska, was, recently, glaciated, as, the, glaciers, receded, they, left, depressions, in, the, topography, that, have, since, filled, with, water, creating, lakes, and, bogs, especially, muskeg, soil, found, throughout, the, taiga, taiga, soil, tends, to, be, young, and, poor, in, nutrients, lacking, the, deep, organically, enriched, profile, present, in, temperate, deciduous, forests, the, colder, climate, hinders, development, of, soil, and, the, ease, with, which, plants, can, use, its, nutrients, the, relative, lack, of, deciduous, trees, which, drop, huge, volumes, of, leaves, annually, and, grazing, animals, which, contribute, significant, manure, are, also, factors, the, diversity, of, soil, organisms, in, the, boreal, forest, is, high, comparable, to, the, tropical, rainforest, fallen, leaves, and, moss, can, remain, on, the, forest, floor, for, a, long, time, in, the, cool, moist, climate, which, limits, their, organic, contribution, to, the, soil, acids, from, evergreen, needles, further, leach, the, soil, creating, spodosol, also, known, as, podzol, and, the, acidic, forest, floor, often, has, only, lichens, and, some, mosses, growing, on, it, in, clearings, in, the, forest, and, in, areas, with, more, boreal, deciduous, trees, there, are, more, herbs, and, berries, growing, and, soils, are, consequently, deeper, since, north, america, and, eurasia, were, originally, connected, by, the, bering, land, bridge, a, number, of, animal, and, plant, species, more, animals, than, plants, were, able, to, colonize, both, land, masses, and, are, globally, distributed, throughout, the, taiga, biome, see, circumboreal, region, others, differ, regionally, typically, with, each, genus, having, several, distinct, species, each, occupying, different, regions, of, the, taiga, taigas, also, have, some, small, leaved, deciduous, trees, like, birch, alder, willow, and, poplar, these, grow, mostly, in, areas, further, south, of, the, most, extreme, winter, weather, the, dahurian, larch, tolerates, the, coldest, winters, of, the, northern, hemisphere, in, eastern, siberia, the, very, southernmost, parts, of, the, taiga, may, have, trees, such, as, oak, maple, elm, and, lime, scattered, among, the, conifers, and, there, is, usually, a, gradual, transition, into, a, temperate, mixed, forest, such, as, the, eastern, forest, boreal, transition, of, eastern, canada, in, the, interior, of, the, continents, with, the, driest, climates, the, boreal, forests, might, grade, into, temperate, grassland, there, are, two, major, types, of, taiga, the, southern, part, is, the, closed, canopy, forest, consisting, of, many, closely, spaced, trees, and, mossy, groundcover, in, clearings, in, the, forest, shrubs, and, wildflowers, are, common, such, as, the, fireweed, and, lupine, the, other, type, is, the, lichen, woodland, or, sparse, taiga, with, trees, that, are, farther, spaced, and, lichen, groundcover, the, latter, is, common, in, the, northernmost, taiga, in, the, northernmost, taiga, the, forest, cover, is, not, only, more, sparse, but, often, stunted, in, growth, form, moreover, ice, pruned, asymmetric, black, spruce, in, north, america, are, often, seen, with, diminished, foliage, on, the, windward, side, in, canada, scandinavia, and, finland, the, boreal, forest, is, usually, divided, into, three, subzones, the, high, boreal, northern, boreal, taiga, zone, the, middle, boreal, closed, forest, and, the, southern, boreal, a, closed, canopy, boreal, forest, with, some, scattered, temperate, deciduous, trees, among, the, conifers, commonly, seen, are, species, such, as, maple, elm, and, oak, this, southern, boreal, forest, experiences, the, longest, and, warmest, growing, season, of, the, biome, in, some, regions, including, scandinavia, and, western, russia, this, subzone, is, commonly, used, for, agricultural, purposes, the, boreal, forest, is, home, to, many, types, of, berries, some, species, are, confined, to, the, southern, and, middle, closed, boreal, forest, such, as, wild, strawberry, and, partridgeberry, others, grow, in, most, areas, of, the, taiga, such, as, cranberry, and, cloudberry, some, berries, can, grow, in, both, the, taiga, and, the, lower, arctic, southern, regions, tundra, such, as, bilberry, bunchberry, and, lingonberry, the, forests, of, the, taiga, are, largely, coniferous, dominated, by, larch, spruce, fir, and, pine, the, woodland, mix, varies, according, to, geography, and, climate, for, example, the, eastern, canadian, forests, ecoregion, of, the, higher, elevations, of, the, laurentian, mountains, and, the, northern, appalachian, mountains, in, canada, is, dominated, by, balsam, fir, abies, balsamea, while, further, north, the, eastern, canadian, shield, taiga, of, northern, quebec, and, labrador, is, mostly, black, spruce, picea, mariana, and, tamarack, larch, larix, laricina, evergreen, species, in, the, taiga, spruce, fir, and, pine, have, a, number, of, adaptations, specifically, for, survival, in, harsh, taiga, winters, although, larch, which, is, extremely, cold, tolerant, is, deciduous, taiga, trees, tend, to, have, shallow, roots, to, take, advantage, of, the, thin, soils, while, many, of, them, seasonally, alter, their, biochemistry, to, make, them, more, resistant, to, freezing, called, hardening, the, narrow, conical, shape, of, northern, conifers, and, their, downward, drooping, limbs, also, help, them, shed, snow, because, the, sun, is, low, in, the, horizon, for, most, of, the, year, it, is, difficult, for, plants, to, generate, energy, from, photosynthesis, pine, spruce, and, fir, do, not, lose, their, leaves, seasonally, and, are, able, to, photosynthesize, with, their, older, leaves, in, late, winter, and, spring, when, light, is, good, but, temperatures, are, still, too, low, for, new, growth, to, commence, the, adaptation, of, evergreen, needles, limits, the, water, lost, due, to, transpiration, and, their, dark, green, color, increases, their, absorption, of, sunlight, although, precipitation, is, not, a, limiting, factor, the, ground, freezes, during, the, winter, months, and, plant, roots, are, unable, to, absorb, water, so, desiccation, can, be, a, severe, problem, in, late, winter, for, evergreens, although, the, taiga, is, dominated, by, coniferous, forests, some, broadleaf, trees, also, occur, including, birch, aspen, willow, and, rowan, many, smaller, herbaceous, plants, such, as, ferns, and, occasionally, ramps, grow, closer, to, the, ground, periodic, stand, replacing, wildfires, with, return, times, of, between, 20, and, 200, years, clear, out, the, tree, canopies, allowing, sunlight, to, invigorate, new, growth, on, the, forest, floor, for, some, species, wildfires, are, a, necessary, part, of, the, life, cycle, in, the, taiga, some, e, g, jack, pine, have, cones, which, only, open, to, release, their, seed, after, a, fire, dispersing, their, seeds, onto, the, newly, cleared, ground, certain, species, of, fungi, such, as, morels, are, also, known, to, do, this, grasses, grow, wherever, they, can, find, a, patch, of, sun, mosses, and, lichens, thrive, on, the, damp, ground, and, on, the, sides, of, tree, trunks, in, comparison, with, other, biomes, however, the, taiga, has, low, botanical, diversity, coniferous, trees, are, the, dominant, plants, of, the, taiga, biome, very, few, species, in, four, main, genera, are, found, the, evergreen, spruce, fir, and, pine, and, the, deciduous, larch, in, north, america, one, or, two, species, of, fir, and, one, or, two, species, of, spruce, are, dominant, across, scandinavia, and, western, russia, the, scots, pine, is, a, common, component, of, the, taiga, while, taiga, of, the, russian, far, east, and, mongolia, is, dominated, by, larch, rich, in, spruce, and, scots, pine, in, the, western, siberian, plain, the, taiga, is, dominated, by, larch, in, eastern, siberia, before, returning, to, its, original, floristic, richness, on, the, pacific, shores, two, deciduous, trees, mingle, throughout, southern, siberia, birch, and, populus, tremula, the, boreal, forest, taiga, supports, a, relatively, small, variety, of, highly, specialized, and, adapted, animals, due, to, the, harshness, of, the, climate, canada, s, boreal, forest, includes, 85, species, of, mammals, 130, species, of, fish, and, an, estimated, 32, 000, species, of, insects, insects, play, a, critical, role, as, pollinators, decomposers, and, as, a, part, of, the, food, web, many, nesting, birds, rodents, and, small, carnivorous, mammals, rely, on, them, for, food, in, the, summer, months, the, cold, winters, and, short, summers, make, the, taiga, a, challenging, biome, for, reptiles, and, amphibians, which, depend, on, environmental, conditions, to, regulate, their, body, temperatures, there, are, only, a, few, species, in, the, boreal, forest, including, red, sided, garter, snake, common, european, adder, blue, spotted, salamander, northern, two, lined, salamander, siberian, salamander, wood, frog, northern, leopard, frog, boreal, chorus, frog, american, toad, and, canadian, toad, most, hibernate, underground, in, winter, fish, of, the, taiga, must, be, able, to, withstand, cold, water, conditions, and, be, able, to, adapt, to, life, under, ice, covered, water, species, in, the, taiga, include, alaska, blackfish, northern, pike, walleye, longnose, sucker, white, sucker, various, species, of, cisco, lake, whitefish, round, whitefish, pygmy, whitefish, arctic, lamprey, various, grayling, species, brook, trout, including, sea, run, brook, trout, in, the, hudson, bay, area, chum, salmon, siberian, taimen, lenok, and, lake, chub, the, taiga, is, mainly, home, to, a, number, of, large, herbivorous, mammals, such, as, alces, alces, moose, and, a, few, subspecies, of, rangifer, tarandus, reindeer, in, eurasia, caribou, in, north, america, some, areas, of, the, more, southern, closed, boreal, forest, have, populations, of, other, cervidae, species, such, as, the, maral, elk, sitka, black, tailed, deer, and, roe, deer, while, normally, a, polar, species, some, southern, herds, of, muskoxen, reside, in, the, taiga, of, russia, s, far, east, and, north, america, the, amur, kamchatka, region, of, far, eastern, russia, also, supports, the, snow, sheep, the, russian, relative, of, the, american, bighorn, sheep, wild, boar, and, long, tailed, goral, the, largest, animal, in, the, taiga, is, the, wood, bison, of, northern, canada, alaska, additionally, some, numbers, of, the, american, plains, bison, have, been, introduced, into, the, russian, far, east, as, part, of, the, taiga, regeneration, project, called, pleistocene, park, in, addition, to, przewalski, s, horse, small, mammals, of, the, taiga, biome, include, rodent, species, such, as, the, beaver, squirrel, chipmunk, marmot, lemming, north, american, porcupine, and, vole, as, well, as, a, small, number, of, lagomorph, species, such, as, the, pika, snowshoe, hare, and, mountain, hare, these, species, have, adapted, to, survive, the, harsh, winters, in, their, native, ranges, some, larger, mammals, such, as, bears, eat, heartily, during, the, summer, in, order, to, gain, weight, and, then, go, into, hibernation, during, the, winter, other, animals, have, adapted, layers, of, fur, or, feathers, to, insulate, them, from, the, cold, predatory, mammals, of, the, taiga, must, be, adapted, to, travel, long, distances, in, search, of, scattered, prey, or, be, able, to, supplement, their, diet, with, vegetation, or, other, forms, of, food, such, as, raccoons, mammalian, predators, of, the, taiga, include, canada, lynx, eurasian, lynx, stoat, siberian, weasel, least, weasel, sable, american, marten, north, american, river, otter, european, otter, american, mink, wolverine, asian, badger, fisher, timber, wolf, mongolian, wolf, coyote, red, fox, arctic, fox, grizzly, bear, american, black, bear, asiatic, black, bear, ussuri, brown, bear, polar, bear, only, small, areas, of, northern, taiga, siberian, tiger, and, amur, leopard, more, than, 300, species, of, birds, have, their, nesting, grounds, in, the, taiga, siberian, thrush, white, throated, sparrow, and, black, throated, green, warbler, migrate, to, this, habitat, to, take, advantage, of, the, long, summer, days, and, abundance, of, insects, found, around, the, numerous, bogs, and, lakes, of, the, 300, species, of, birds, that, summer, in, the, taiga, only, 30, stay, for, the, winter, these, are, either, carrion, feeding, or, large, raptors, that, can, take, live, mammal, prey, such, as, the, golden, eagle, rough, legged, buzzard, also, known, as, the, rough, legged, hawk, steller, s, sea, eagle, in, coastal, northeastern, russia, japan, great, gray, owl, snowy, owl, barred, owl, great, horned, owl, crow, and, raven, the, only, other, viable, adaptation, is, seed, eating, birds, which, include, several, species, of, grouse, capercaillie, and, crossbills, fire, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, factors, shaping, the, composition, and, development, of, boreal, forest, stands, it, is, the, dominant, stand, renewing, disturbance, through, much, of, the, canadian, boreal, forest, the, fire, history, that, characterizes, an, ecosystem, is, its, fire, regime, which, has, 3, elements, 1, fire, type, and, intensity, e, g, crown, fires, severe, surface, fires, and, light, surface, fires, 2, size, of, typical, fires, of, significance, and, 3, frequency, or, return, intervals, for, specific, land, units, the, average, time, within, a, fire, regime, to, burn, an, area, equivalent, to, the, total, area, of, an, ecosystem, is, its, fire, rotation, heinselman, 1973, or, fire, cycle, van, wagner, 1978, however, as, heinselman, 1981, noted, each, physiographic, site, tends, to, have, its, own, return, interval, so, that, some, areas, are, skipped, for, long, periods, while, others, might, burn, two, times, or, more, often, during, a, nominal, fire, rotation, the, dominant, fire, regime, in, the, boreal, forest, is, high, intensity, crown, fires, or, severe, surface, fires, of, very, large, size, often, more, than, 10, 000, ha, 100, km, 2, and, sometimes, more, than, 400, 000, ha, 4000, km, 2, such, fires, kill, entire, stands, fire, rotations, in, the, drier, regions, of, western, canada, and, alaska, average, 50, 100, years, shorter, than, in, the, moister, climates, of, eastern, canada, where, they, may, average, 200, years, or, more, fire, cycles, also, tend, to, be, long, near, the, tree, line, in, the, subarctic, spruce, lichen, woodlands, the, longest, cycles, possibly, 300, years, probably, occur, in, the, western, boreal, in, floodplain, white, spruce, amiro, et, al, 2001, calculated, the, mean, fire, cycle, for, the, period, 1980, to, 1999, in, the, canadian, boreal, forest, including, taiga, at, 126, years, increased, fire, activity, has, been, predicted, for, western, canada, but, parts, of, eastern, canada, may, experience, less, fire, in, future, because, of, greater, precipitation, in, a, warmer, climate, the, mature, boreal, forest, pattern, in, the, south, shows, balsam, fir, dominant, on, well, drained, sites, in, eastern, canada, changing, centrally, and, westward, to, a, prominence, of, white, spruce, with, black, spruce, and, tamarack, forming, the, forests, on, peats, and, with, jack, pine, usually, present, on, dry, sites, except, in, the, extreme, east, where, it, is, absent, the, effects, of, fires, are, inextricably, woven, into, the, patterns, of, vegetation, on, the, landscape, which, in, the, east, favour, black, spruce, paper, birch, and, jack, pine, over, balsam, fir, and, in, the, west, give, the, advantage, to, aspen, jack, pine, black, spruce, and, birch, over, white, spruce, many, investigators, have, reported, the, ubiquity, of, charcoal, under, the, forest, floor, and, in, the, upper, soil, profile, charcoal, in, soils, provided, bryson, et, al, 1965, with, clues, about, the, forest, history, of, an, area, 280, km, north, of, the, then, current, tree, line, at, ennadai, lake, district, keewatin, northwest, territories, two, lines, of, evidence, support, the, thesis, that, fire, has, always, been, an, integral, factor, in, the, boreal, forest, 1, direct, eye, witness, accounts, and, forest, fire, statistics, and, 2, indirect, circumstantial, evidence, based, on, the, effects, of, fire, as, well, as, on, persisting, indicators, the, patchwork, mosaic, of, forest, stands, in, the, boreal, forest, typically, with, abrupt, irregular, boundaries, circumscribing, homogenous, stands, is, indirect, but, compelling, testimony, to, the, role, of, fire, in, shaping, the, forest, the, fact, is, that, most, boreal, forest, stands, are, less, than, 100, years, old, and, only, in, the, rather, few, areas, that, have, escaped, burning, are, there, stands, of, white, spruce, older, than, 250, years, the, prevalence, of, fire, adaptive, morphologic, and, reproductive, characteristics, of, many, boreal, plant, species, is, further, evidence, pointing, to, a, long, and, intimate, association, with, fire, seven, of, the, ten, most, common, trees, in, the, boreal, forest, jack, pine, lodgepole, pine, aspen, balsam, poplar, populus, balsamifera, paper, birch, tamarack, black, spruce, can, be, classed, as, pioneers, in, their, adaptations, for, rapid, invasion, of, open, areas, white, spruce, shows, some, pioneering, abilities, too, but, is, less, able, than, black, spruce, and, the, pines, to, disperse, seed, at, all, seasons, only, balsam, fir, and, alpine, fir, seem, to, be, poorly, adapted, to, reproduce, after, fire, as, their, cones, disintegrate, at, maturity, leaving, no, seed, in, the, crowns, the, oldest, forests, in, the, northwest, boreal, region, some, older, than, 300, years, are, of, white, spruce, occurring, as, pure, stands, on, moist, floodplains, here, the, frequency, of, fire, is, much, less, than, on, adjacent, uplands, dominated, by, pine, black, spruce, and, aspen, in, contrast, in, the, cordilleran, region, fire, is, most, frequent, in, the, valley, bottoms, decreasing, upward, as, shown, by, a, mosaic, of, young, pioneer, pine, and, broadleaf, stands, below, and, older, spruce, fir, on, the, slopes, above, without, fire, the, boreal, forest, would, become, more, and, more, homogeneous, with, the, long, lived, white, spruce, gradually, replacing, pine, aspen, balsam, poplar, and, birch, and, perhaps, even, black, spruce, except, on, the, peatlands, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, twentieth, century, the, zone, of, latitude, occupied, by, the, boreal, forest, experienced, some, of, the, greatest, temperature, increases, on, earth, winter, temperatures, have, increased, more, than, summer, temperatures, in, summer, the, daily, low, temperature, has, increased, more, than, the, daily, high, temperature, the, number, of, days, with, extremely, cold, temperatures, e, g, 20, to, 40, c, 4, to, 40, f, has, decreased, irregularly, but, systematically, in, nearly, all, the, boreal, region, allowing, better, survival, for, tree, damaging, insects, in, fairbanks, alaska, the, length, of, the, frost, free, season, has, increased, from, 60, to, 90, days, in, the, early, twentieth, century, to, about, 120, days, a, century, later, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, boreal, environments, have, only, a, few, states, which, are, stable, in, the, long, term, a, treeless, tundra, steppe, a, forest, with, 75, tree, cover, and, an, open, woodland, with, 20, and, 45, tree, cover, thus, continued, climate, change, would, be, able, to, force, at, least, some, of, the, presently, existing, taiga, forests, into, one, of, the, two, woodland, states, or, even, into, a, treeless, steppe, but, it, could, also, shift, tundra, areas, into, woodland, or, forest, states, as, they, warm, and, become, more, suitable, for, tree, growth, in, keeping, with, this, hypothesis, several, studies, published, in, the, early, 2010s, found, that, there, was, already, a, substantial, drought, induced, tree, loss, in, the, western, canadian, boreal, forests, since, the, 1960s, although, this, trend, was, weak, or, even, non, existent, in, the, eastern, forests, it, was, particularly, pronounced, in, the, western, coniferous, forests, however, in, 2016, a, study, found, no, overall, canadian, boreal, forest, trend, between, 1950, and, 2012, while, it, also, found, improved, growth, in, some, southern, boreal, forests, and, dampened, growth, in, the, north, contrary, to, what, the, hypothesis, would, suggest, those, patterns, were, statistically, weak, a, 2018, landsat, reanalysis, confirmed, that, there, was, a, drying, trend, and, a, loss, of, forest, in, western, canadian, forests, and, some, greening, in, the, wetter, east, but, it, had, also, concluded, that, most, of, the, forest, loss, attributed, to, climate, change, in, the, earlier, studies, had, instead, constituted, a, delayed, response, to, anthropogenic, disturbance, subsequent, research, found, that, even, in, the, forests, where, biomass, trends, did, not, change, there, was, a, substantial, shift, towards, the, deciduous, broad, leaved, trees, with, higher, drought, tolerance, over, the, past, 65, years, and, another, landsat, analysis, of, 100, 000, undisturbed, sites, found, that, the, areas, with, low, tree, cover, became, greener, in, response, to, warming, but, tree, mortality, browning, became, the, dominant, response, as, the, proportion, of, existing, tree, cover, increased, while, the, majority, of, studies, on, boreal, forest, transitions, have, been, done, in, canada, similar, trends, have, been, detected, in, the, other, countries, summer, warming, has, been, shown, to, increase, water, stress, and, reduce, tree, growth, in, dry, areas, of, the, southern, boreal, forest, in, central, alaska, and, portions, of, far, eastern, russia, in, siberia, the, taiga, is, converting, from, predominantly, needle, shedding, larch, trees, to, evergreen, conifers, in, response, to, a, warming, climate, this, is, likely, to, further, accelerate, warming, as, the, evergreen, trees, will, absorb, more, of, the, sun, s, rays, given, the, vast, size, of, the, area, such, a, change, has, the, potential, to, affect, areas, well, outside, of, the, region, in, much, of, the, boreal, forest, in, alaska, the, growth, of, white, spruce, trees, are, stunted, by, unusually, warm, summers, while, trees, on, some, of, the, coldest, fringes, of, the, forest, are, experiencing, faster, growth, than, previously, lack, of, moisture, in, the, warmer, summers, are, also, stressing, the, birch, trees, of, central, alaska, in, addition, to, these, observations, there, has, also, been, work, on, projecting, future, forest, trends, a, 2018, study, of, the, seven, tree, species, dominant, in, the, eastern, canadian, forests, found, that, while, 2, c, warming, alone, increases, their, growth, by, around, 13, on, average, water, availability, is, much, more, important, than, temperature, and, further, warming, of, up, to, 4, c, would, result, in, substantial, declines, unless, matched, by, increases, in, precipitation, a, 2019, study, suggested, that, the, forest, plots, commonly, used, to, evaluate, boreal, forest, response, to, climate, change, tend, to, have, less, evolutionary, competition, between, trees, than, the, typical, forest, and, that, with, strong, competition, there, was, little, net, growth, in, response, to, warming, climatic, change, only, stimulated, growth, for, trees, under, weak, competition, in, central, boreal, forests, a, 2021, paper, had, confirmed, that, the, boreal, forests, are, much, more, strongly, affected, by, climate, change, than, the, other, forest, types, in, canada, and, projected, that, most, of, the, eastern, canadian, boreal, forests, would, reach, a, tipping, point, around, 2080, under, the, rcp, 8, 5, scenario, which, represents, the, largest, potential, increase, in, anthropogenic, emissions, another, 2021, study, projected, that, under, the, moderate, ssp2, 4, 5, scenario, boreal, forests, would, experience, a, 15, worldwide, increase, in, biomass, by, the, end, of, the, century, but, this, would, be, more, than, offset, by, the, 41, biomass, decline, in, the, tropics, in, 2022, the, results, of, a, 5, year, warming, experiment, in, north, america, had, shown, that, the, juveniles, of, tree, species, which, currently, dominate, the, southern, margins, of, the, boreal, forests, fare, the, worst, in, response, to, even, 1, 5, c, or, 3, 1, c, of, warming, and, the, associated, reductions, in, precipitation, while, the, temperate, species, which, would, benefit, from, such, conditions, are, also, present, in, the, southern, boreal, forests, they, are, both, rare, and, have, slower, growth, rates, a, 2022, assessment, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, designated, two, inter, related, tipping, points, associated, with, climate, change, the, die, off, of, taiga, at, its, southern, edge, and, the, area, s, consequent, reversion, to, grassland, similar, to, the, amazon, rainforest, dieback, and, the, opposite, process, to, the, north, where, the, rapid, warming, of, the, adjacent, tundra, areas, converts, them, to, taiga, while, both, of, these, processes, can, already, be, observed, today, the, assessment, believes, that, they, would, likely, not, become, unstoppable, and, thus, meet, the, definition, of, a, tipping, point, until, global, warming, of, around, 4, c, however, the, certainty, level, is, still, limited, and, it, is, possible, that, 1, 5, c, would, be, sufficient, for, either, tipping, point, on, the, other, hand, the, southern, die, off, may, not, be, inevitable, until, 5, c, while, the, replacement, of, tundra, with, taiga, may, require, 7, 2, c, once, the, right, level, of, warming, is, met, either, process, would, take, at, least, 40, 50, years, to, finish, and, is, more, likely, to, unfold, over, a, century, or, more, while, the, southern, die, off, would, involve, the, loss, of, around, 52, billion, tons, of, carbon, the, net, result, is, cooling, of, around, 0, 18, c, globally, and, between, 0, 5, c, to, 2, c, regionally, likewise, boreal, forest, expansion, into, tundra, has, a, net, global, warming, effect, of, around, 0, 14, c, globally, and, 0, 5, c, to, 1, c, regionally, even, though, new, forest, growth, captures, around, 6, billion, tons, of, carbon, in, both, cases, this, is, due, to, the, snow, covered, ground, having, a, much, greater, albedo, than, the, forests, according, to, a, later, study, disappearing, of, boreal, forests, can, also, increase, warming, despite, the, effect, on, albedo, while, the, conclusion, about, cooling, from, deforestation, in, these, areas, made, by, previous, studies, results, from, the, failure, of, models, to, properly, capture, the, effects, of, evapotranspiration, primary, boreal, forests, hold, 1, 042, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, more, than, currently, found, in, the, atmosphere, 2, times, more, than, all, human, caused, ghg, emissions, since, the, year, 1870, in, a, warmer, climate, their, ability, to, store, carbon, will, be, reduced, some, of, the, larger, cities, situated, in, this, biome, are, murmansk, arkhangelsk, yakutsk, anchorage, yellowknife, troms, lule, and, oulu, large, areas, of, siberia, s, taiga, have, been, harvested, for, lumber, since, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, previously, the, forest, was, protected, by, the, restrictions, of, the, soviet, ministry, of, forestry, but, with, the, collapse, of, the, union, the, restrictions, regarding, trade, with, western, nations, have, vanished, trees, are, easy, to, harvest, and, sell, well, so, loggers, have, begun, harvesting, russian, taiga, evergreen, trees, for, sale, to, nations, previously, forbidden, by, soviet, law, recent, years, have, seen, outbreaks, of, insect, pests, in, forest, destroying, plagues, the, spruce, bark, beetle, dendroctonus, rufipennis, in, yukon, and, alaska, the, mountain, pine, beetle, in, british, columbia, the, aspen, leaf, miner, the, larch, sawfly, the, spruce, budworm, choristoneura, fumiferana, the, spruce, coneworm, the, effect, of, sulphur, dioxide, on, woody, boreal, forest, species, was, investigated, by, addison, et, al, 1984, who, exposed, plants, growing, on, native, soils, and, tailings, to, 15, 2, mol, m, 3, 0, 34, ppm, of, so, 2, on, co, 2, assimilation, rate, nar, the, canadian, maximum, acceptable, limit, for, atmospheric, so, 2, is, 0, 34, ppm, fumigation, with, so, 2, significantly, reduced, nar, in, all, species, and, produced, visible, symptoms, of, injury, in, 2, 20, days, the, decrease, in, nar, of, deciduous, species, trembling, aspen, willow, green, alder, and, white, birch, was, significantly, more, rapid, than, of, conifers, white, spruce, black, spruce, and, jack, pine, or, an, evergreen, angiosperm, labrador, tea, growing, on, a, fertilized, brunisol, these, metabolic, and, visible, injury, responses, seemed, to, be, related, to, the, differences, in, s, uptake, owing, in, part, to, higher, gas, exchange, rates, for, deciduous, species, than, for, conifers, conifers, growing, in, oil, sands, tailings, responded, to, so, 2, with, a, significantly, more, rapid, decrease, in, nar, compared, with, those, growing, in, the, brunisol, perhaps, because, of, predisposing, toxic, material, in, the, tailings, however, sulphur, uptake, and, visible, symptom, development, did, not, differ, between, conifers, growing, on, the, 2, substrates, acidification, of, precipitation, by, anthropogenic, acid, forming, emissions, has, been, associated, with, damage, to, vegetation, and, reduced, forest, productivity, but, 2, year, old, white, spruce, that, were, subjected, to, simulated, acid, rain, at, ph, 4, 6, 3, 6, and, 2, 6, applied, weekly, for, 7, weeks, incurred, no, statistically, significant, p, 0, 05, reduction, in, growth, during, the, experiment, compared, with, the, background, control, ph, 5, 6, abouguendia, and, baschak, 1987, however, symptoms, of, injury, were, observed, in, all, treatments, the, number, of, plants, and, the, number, of, needles, affected, increased, with, increasing, rain, acidity, and, with, time, scherbatskoy, and, klein, 1983, found, no, significant, effect, of, chlorophyll, concentration, in, white, spruce, at, ph, 4, 3, and, 2, 8, but, abouguendia, and, baschak, 1987, found, a, significant, reduction, in, white, spruce, at, ph, 2, 6, while, the, foliar, sulphur, content, significantly, greater, at, ph, 2, 6, than, any, of, the, other, treatments, the, taiga, stores, enormous, quantities, of, carbon, more, than, the, world, s, temperate, and, tropical, forests, combined, much, of, it, in, wetlands, and, peatland, in, fact, current, estimates, place, boreal, forests, as, storing, twice, as, much, carbon, per, unit, area, as, tropical, forests, wildfires, could, use, up, a, significant, part, of, the, global, carbon, budget, so, fire, management, at, about, 12, dollars, per, tonne, of, carbon, not, released, is, very, cheap, compared, to, the, social, cost, of, carbon, some, nations, are, discussing, protecting, areas, of, the, taiga, by, prohibiting, logging, mining, oil, and, gas, production, and, other, forms, of, development, responding, to, a, letter, signed, by, 1, 500, scientists, calling, on, political, leaders, to, protect, at, least, half, of, the, boreal, forest, two, canadian, provincial, governments, ontario, and, quebec, offered, election, promises, to, discuss, measures, in, 2008, that, might, eventually, classify, at, least, half, of, their, northern, boreal, forest, as, protected, although, both, provinces, admitted, it, would, take, decades, to, plan, working, with, aboriginal, and, local, communities, and, ultimately, mapping, out, precise, boundaries, of, the, areas, off, limits, to, development, the, measures, were, touted, to, create, some, of, the, largest, protected, areas, networks, in, the, world, once, completed, since, then, however, very, little, action, has, been, taken, for, instance, in, february, 2010, the, canadian, government, established, limited, protection, for, 13, 000, square, kilometres, of, boreal, forest, by, creating, a, new, 10, 700, square, kilometre, park, reserve, in, the, mealy, mountains, area, of, eastern, canada, and, a, 3, 000, square, kilometre, waterway, provincial, park, that, follows, alongside, the, eagle, river, from, headwaters, to, sea, one, of, the, biggest, areas, of, research, and, a, topic, still, full, of, unsolved, questions, is, the, recurring, disturbance, of, fire, and, the, role, it, plays, in, propagating, the, lichen, woodland, the, phenomenon, of, wildfire, by, lightning, strike, is, the, primary, determinant, of, understory, vegetation, and, because, of, this, it, is, considered, to, be, the, predominant, force, behind, community, and, ecosystem, properties, in, the, lichen, woodland, the, significance, of, fire, is, clearly, evident, when, one, considers, that, understory, vegetation, influences, tree, seedling, germination, in, the, short, term, and, decomposition, of, biomass, and, nutrient, availability, in, the, long, term, the, recurrent, cycle, of, large, damaging, fire, occurs, approximately, every, 70, to, 100, years, understanding, the, dynamics, of, this, ecosystem, is, entangled, with, discovering, the, successional, paths, that, the, vegetation, exhibits, after, a, fire, trees, shrubs, and, lichens, all, recover, from, fire, induced, damage, through, vegetative, reproduction, as, well, as, invasion, by, propagules, seeds, that, have, fallen, and, become, buried, provide, little, help, in, re, establishment, of, a, species, the, reappearance, of, lichens, is, reasoned, to, occur, because, of, varying, conditions, and, light, nutrient, availability, in, each, different, microstate, several, different, studies, have, been, done, that, have, led, to, the, formation, of, the, theory, that, post, fire, development, can, be, propagated, by, any, of, four, pathways, self, replacement, species, dominance, relay, species, replacement, or, gap, phase, self, replacement, self, replacement, is, simply, the, re, establishment, of, the, pre, fire, dominant, species, species, dominance, relay, is, a, sequential, attempt, of, tree, species, to, establish, dominance, in, the, canopy, species, replacement, is, when, fires, occur, in, sufficient, frequency, to, interrupt, species, dominance, relay, gap, phase, self, replacement, is, the, least, common, and, so, far, has, only, been, documented, in, western, canada, it, is, a, self, replacement, of, the, surviving, species, into, the, canopy, gaps, after, a, fire, kills, another, species, the, particular, pathway, taken, after, fire, disturbance, depends, on, how, the, landscape, is, able, to, support, trees, as, well, as, fire, frequency, fire, frequency, has, a, large, role, in, shaping, the, original, inception, of, the, lower, forest, line, of, the, lichen, woodland, taiga, it, has, been, hypothesized, by, serge, payette, that, the, spruce, moss, forest, ecosystem, was, changed, into, the, lichen, woodland, biome, due, to, the, initiation, of, two, compounded, strong, disturbances, large, fire, and, the, appearance, and, attack, of, the, spruce, budworm, the, spruce, budworm, is, a, deadly, insect, to, the, spruce, populations, in, the, southern, regions, of, the, taiga, j, p, jasinski, confirmed, this, theory, five, years, later, stating, their, persistence, along, with, their, previous, moss, forest, histories, and, current, occurrence, adjacent, to, closed, moss, forests, indicate, that, they, are, an, alternative, stable, state, to, the, spruce, moss, forests
