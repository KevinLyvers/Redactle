heat, capacity, or, thermal, capacity, is, a, physical, property, of, matter, defined, as, the, amount, of, heat, to, be, supplied, to, an, object, to, produce, a, unit, change, in, its, temperature, the, si, unit, of, heat, capacity, is, joule, per, kelvin, j, k, heat, capacity, is, an, extensive, property, the, corresponding, intensive, property, is, the, specific, heat, capacity, found, by, dividing, the, heat, capacity, of, an, object, by, its, mass, dividing, the, heat, capacity, by, the, amount, of, substance, in, moles, yields, its, molar, heat, capacity, the, volumetric, heat, capacity, measures, the, heat, capacity, per, volume, in, architecture, and, civil, engineering, the, heat, capacity, of, a, building, is, often, referred, to, as, its, thermal, mass, the, heat, capacity, of, an, object, denoted, by, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, limit, where, q, displaystyle, delta, q, is, the, amount, of, heat, that, must, be, added, to, the, object, of, mass, m, in, order, to, raise, its, temperature, by, t, displaystyle, delta, t, the, value, of, this, parameter, usually, varies, considerably, depending, on, the, starting, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, of, the, object, and, the, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, applied, to, it, in, particular, it, typically, varies, dramatically, with, phase, transitions, such, as, melting, or, vaporization, see, enthalpy, of, fusion, and, enthalpy, of, vaporization, therefore, it, should, be, considered, a, function, c, p, t, displaystyle, c, p, t, of, those, two, variables, the, variation, can, be, ignored, in, contexts, when, working, with, objects, in, narrow, ranges, of, temperature, and, pressure, for, example, the, heat, capacity, of, a, block, of, iron, weighing, one, pound, is, about, 204, j, k, when, measured, from, a, starting, temperature, t, 25, c, and, p, 1, atm, of, pressure, that, approximate, value, is, adequate, for, temperatures, between, 15, c, and, 35, c, and, surrounding, pressures, from, 0, to, 10, atmospheres, because, the, exact, value, varies, very, little, in, those, ranges, one, can, trust, that, the, same, heat, input, of, 204, j, will, raise, the, temperature, of, the, block, from, 15, c, to, 16, c, or, from, 34, c, to, 35, c, with, negligible, error, at, constant, pressure, heat, supplied, to, the, system, contributes, to, both, the, work, done, and, the, change, in, internal, energy, according, to, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, the, heat, capacity, is, called, c, p, displaystyle, c, p, and, defined, as, c, p, q, d, t, p, c, o, n, s, t, displaystyle, c, p, frac, delta, q, dt, bigr, p, const, from, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, follows, q, d, u, p, d, v, displaystyle, delta, q, du, pdv, and, the, inner, energy, as, a, function, of, p, displaystyle, p, and, t, displaystyle, t, is, q, u, t, p, d, t, u, p, t, d, p, p, v, t, p, d, t, v, p, t, d, p, displaystyle, delta, q, left, frac, partial, u, partial, t, right, p, dt, left, frac, partial, u, partial, p, right, t, dp, p, left, for, constant, pressure, d, p, 0, displaystyle, dp, 0, the, equation, simplifies, to, c, p, q, d, t, p, c, o, n, s, t, u, t, p, p, v, t, p, h, t, p, displaystyle, c, p, frac, delta, q, dt, bigr, p, const, left, frac, partial, u, partial, t, right, p, p, left, frac, partial, v, partial, t, right, p, left, frac, partial, h, partial, t, right, p, where, the, final, equality, follows, from, the, appropriate, maxwell, relations, and, is, commonly, used, as, the, definition, of, the, isobaric, heat, capacity, a, system, undergoing, a, process, at, constant, volume, implies, that, no, expansion, work, is, done, so, the, heat, supplied, contributes, only, to, the, change, in, internal, energy, the, heat, capacity, obtained, this, way, is, denoted, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, the, value, of, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, is, always, less, than, the, value, of, c, p, displaystyle, c, p, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, c, p, displaystyle, c, p, expressing, the, inner, energy, as, a, function, of, the, variables, t, displaystyle, t, and, v, displaystyle, v, gives, q, u, t, v, d, t, u, v, t, d, v, p, d, v, displaystyle, delta, q, left, frac, partial, u, partial, t, right, v, dt, left, frac, partial, u, partial, v, right, t, dv, pdv, for, a, constant, volume, d, v, 0, displaystyle, dv, 0, the, heat, capacity, reads, c, v, q, d, t, v, const, u, t, v, displaystyle, c, v, frac, delta, q, dt, bigr, v, text, const, left, frac, partial, u, partial, t, right, v, the, relation, between, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, and, c, p, displaystyle, c, p, is, then, c, p, c, v, u, v, t, p, v, t, p, displaystyle, c, p, c, v, left, left, frac, partial, u, partial, v, right, t, p, right, left, frac, partial, v, partial, t, right, p, mayer, s, relation, where, using, the, above, two, relations, the, specific, heats, can, be, deduced, as, follows, following, from, the, equipartition, of, energy, it, is, deduced, that, an, ideal, gas, has, the, isochoric, heat, capacity, c, v, n, r, n, f, 2, n, r, 3, n, i, 2, displaystyle, c, v, nr, frac, n, f, 2, nr, frac, 3, n, i, 2, where, n, f, displaystyle, n, f, is, the, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, of, each, individual, particle, in, the, gas, and, n, i, n, f, 3, displaystyle, n, i, n, f, 3, is, the, number, of, internal, degrees, of, freedom, where, the, number, 3, comes, from, the, three, translational, degrees, of, freedom, for, a, gas, in, 3d, space, this, means, that, a, monoatomic, ideal, gas, with, zero, internal, degrees, of, freedom, will, have, isochoric, heat, capacity, c, v, 3, n, r, 2, displaystyle, c, v, frac, 3nr, 2, no, change, in, internal, energy, as, the, temperature, of, the, system, is, constant, throughout, the, process, leads, to, only, work, done, by, the, total, supplied, heat, and, thus, an, infinite, amount, of, heat, is, required, to, increase, the, temperature, of, the, system, by, a, unit, temperature, leading, to, infinite, or, undefined, heat, capacity, of, the, system, heat, capacity, of, a, system, undergoing, phase, transition, is, infinite, because, the, heat, is, utilized, in, changing, the, state, of, the, material, rather, than, raising, the, overall, temperature, the, heat, capacity, may, be, well, defined, even, for, heterogeneous, objects, with, separate, parts, made, of, different, materials, such, as, an, electric, motor, a, crucible, with, some, metal, or, a, whole, building, in, many, cases, the, isobaric, heat, capacity, of, such, objects, can, be, computed, by, simply, adding, together, the, isobaric, heat, capacities, of, the, individual, parts, however, this, computation, is, valid, only, when, all, parts, of, the, object, are, at, the, same, external, pressure, before, and, after, the, measurement, that, may, not, be, possible, in, some, cases, for, example, when, heating, an, amount, of, gas, in, an, elastic, container, its, volume, and, pressure, will, both, increase, even, if, the, atmospheric, pressure, outside, the, container, is, kept, constant, therefore, the, effective, heat, capacity, of, the, gas, in, that, situation, will, have, a, value, intermediate, between, its, isobaric, and, isochoric, capacities, c, p, displaystyle, c, p, and, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, for, complex, thermodynamic, systems, with, several, interacting, parts, and, state, variables, or, for, measurement, conditions, that, are, neither, constant, pressure, nor, constant, volume, or, for, situations, where, the, temperature, is, significantly, non, uniform, the, simple, definitions, of, heat, capacity, above, are, not, useful, or, even, meaningful, the, heat, energy, that, is, supplied, may, end, up, as, kinetic, energy, energy, of, motion, and, potential, energy, energy, stored, in, force, fields, both, at, macroscopic, and, atomic, scales, then, the, change, in, temperature, will, depend, on, the, particular, path, that, the, system, followed, through, its, phase, space, between, the, initial, and, final, states, namely, one, must, somehow, specify, how, the, positions, velocities, pressures, volumes, etc, changed, between, the, initial, and, final, states, and, use, the, general, tools, of, thermodynamics, to, predict, the, system, s, reaction, to, a, small, energy, input, the, constant, volume, and, constant, pressure, heating, modes, are, just, two, among, infinitely, many, paths, that, a, simple, homogeneous, system, can, follow, the, heat, capacity, can, usually, be, measured, by, the, method, implied, by, its, definition, start, with, the, object, at, a, known, uniform, temperature, add, a, known, amount, of, heat, energy, to, it, wait, for, its, temperature, to, become, uniform, and, measure, the, change, in, its, temperature, this, method, can, give, moderately, accurate, values, for, many, solids, however, it, cannot, provide, very, precise, measurements, especially, for, gases, the, si, unit, for, heat, capacity, of, an, object, is, joule, per, kelvin, j, k, or, j, k, 1, since, an, increment, of, temperature, of, one, degree, celsius, is, the, same, as, an, increment, of, one, kelvin, that, is, the, same, unit, as, j, c, the, heat, capacity, of, an, object, is, an, amount, of, energy, divided, by, a, temperature, change, which, has, the, dimension, l, 2, m, t, 2, 1, therefore, the, si, unit, j, k, is, equivalent, to, kilogram, meter, squared, per, second, squared, per, kelvin, kg, m, 2, s, 2, k, 1, professionals, in, construction, civil, engineering, chemical, engineering, and, other, technical, disciplines, especially, in, the, united, states, may, use, the, so, called, english, engineering, units, that, include, the, pound, lb, 0, 45359237, kg, as, the, unit, of, mass, the, degree, fahrenheit, or, rankine, 5, 9, k, about, 0, 55556, k, as, the, unit, of, temperature, increment, and, the, british, thermal, unit, btu, 1055, 06, j, as, the, unit, of, heat, in, those, contexts, the, unit, of, heat, capacity, is, 1, btu, r, 1900, j, k, the, btu, was, in, fact, defined, so, that, the, average, heat, capacity, of, one, pound, of, water, would, be, 1, btu, f, in, this, regard, with, respect, to, mass, note, conversion, of, 1, btu, lb, r, 4, 187, j, kg, k, and, the, calorie, below, in, chemistry, heat, amounts, are, often, measured, in, calories, confusingly, two, units, with, that, name, denoted, cal, or, cal, have, been, commonly, used, to, measure, amounts, of, heat, with, these, units, of, heat, energy, the, units, of, heat, capacity, are, most, physical, systems, exhibit, a, positive, heat, capacity, constant, volume, and, constant, pressure, heat, capacities, rigorously, defined, as, partial, derivatives, are, always, positive, for, homogeneous, bodies, however, even, though, it, can, seem, paradoxical, at, first, there, are, some, systems, for, which, the, heat, capacity, q, displaystyle, q, t, displaystyle, delta, t, is, negative, examples, include, a, reversibly, and, nearly, adiabatically, expanding, ideal, gas, which, cools, t, displaystyle, delta, t, 0, while, a, small, amount, of, heat, q, displaystyle, q, 0, is, put, in, or, combusting, methane, with, increasing, temperature, t, displaystyle, delta, t, 0, and, giving, off, heat, q, displaystyle, q, 0, others, are, inhomogeneous, systems, that, do, not, meet, the, strict, definition, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, they, include, gravitating, objects, such, as, stars, and, galaxies, and, also, some, nano, scale, clusters, of, a, few, tens, of, atoms, close, to, a, phase, transition, a, negative, heat, capacity, can, result, in, a, negative, temperature, according, to, the, virial, theorem, for, a, self, gravitating, body, like, a, star, or, an, interstellar, gas, cloud, the, average, potential, energy, u, pot, and, the, average, kinetic, energy, u, kin, are, locked, together, in, the, relation, the, total, energy, u, u, pot, u, kin, therefore, obeys, if, the, system, loses, energy, for, example, by, radiating, energy, into, space, the, average, kinetic, energy, actually, increases, if, a, temperature, is, defined, by, the, average, kinetic, energy, then, the, system, therefore, can, be, said, to, have, a, negative, heat, capacity, a, more, extreme, version, of, this, occurs, with, black, holes, according, to, black, hole, thermodynamics, the, more, mass, and, energy, a, black, hole, absorbs, the, colder, it, becomes, in, contrast, if, it, is, a, net, emitter, of, energy, through, hawking, radiation, it, will, become, hotter, and, hotter, until, it, boils, away, according, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, when, two, systems, with, different, temperatures, interact, via, a, purely, thermal, connection, heat, will, flow, from, the, hotter, system, to, the, cooler, one, this, can, also, be, understood, from, a, statistical, point, of, view, therefore, if, such, systems, have, equal, temperatures, they, are, at, thermal, equilibrium, however, this, equilibrium, is, stable, only, if, the, systems, have, positive, heat, capacities, for, such, systems, when, heat, flows, from, a, higher, temperature, system, to, a, lower, temperature, one, the, temperature, of, the, first, decreases, and, that, of, the, latter, increases, so, that, both, approach, equilibrium, in, contrast, for, systems, with, negative, heat, capacities, the, temperature, of, the, hotter, system, will, further, increase, as, it, loses, heat, and, that, of, the, colder, will, further, decrease, so, that, they, will, move, farther, from, equilibrium, this, means, that, the, equilibrium, is, unstable, for, example, according, to, theory, the, smaller, less, massive, a, black, hole, is, the, smaller, its, schwarzschild, radius, will, be, and, therefore, the, greater, the, curvature, of, its, event, horizon, will, be, as, well, as, its, temperature, thus, the, smaller, the, black, hole, the, more, thermal, radiation, it, will, emit, and, the, more, quickly, it, will, evaporate, by, hawking, radiation
