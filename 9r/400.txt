caesium, iupac, spelling, also, spelled, cesium, in, american, english, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cs, and, atomic, number, 55, it, is, a, soft, silvery, golden, alkali, metal, with, a, melting, point, of, 28, 5, c, 83, 3, f, 301, 6, k, which, makes, it, one, of, only, five, elemental, metals, that, are, liquid, at, or, near, room, temperature, caesium, has, physical, and, chemical, properties, similar, to, those, of, rubidium, and, potassium, it, is, pyrophoric, and, reacts, with, water, even, at, 116, c, 177, f, it, is, the, least, electronegative, element, with, a, value, of, 0, 79, on, the, pauling, scale, it, has, only, one, stable, isotope, caesium, 133, caesium, is, mined, mostly, from, pollucite, caesium, 137, a, fission, product, is, extracted, from, waste, produced, by, nuclear, reactors, it, has, the, largest, atomic, radius, of, all, elements, whose, radii, have, been, measured, or, calculated, at, about, 260, picometers, the, german, chemist, robert, bunsen, and, physicist, gustav, kirchhoff, discovered, caesium, in, 1860, by, the, newly, developed, method, of, flame, spectroscopy, the, first, small, scale, applications, for, caesium, were, as, a, getter, in, vacuum, tubes, and, in, photoelectric, cells, caesium, is, widely, used, in, highly, accurate, atomic, clocks, in, 1967, the, international, system, of, units, began, using, a, specific, hyperfine, transition, of, neutral, caesium, 133, atoms, to, define, the, basic, unit, of, time, the, second, since, the, 1990s, the, largest, application, of, the, element, has, been, as, caesium, formate, for, drilling, fluids, but, it, has, a, range, of, applications, in, the, production, of, electricity, in, electronics, and, in, chemistry, the, radioactive, isotope, caesium, 137, has, a, half, life, of, about, 30, years, and, is, used, in, medical, applications, industrial, gauges, and, hydrology, nonradioactive, caesium, compounds, are, only, mildly, toxic, but, the, pure, metal, s, tendency, to, react, explosively, with, water, means, that, caesium, is, considered, a, hazardous, material, and, the, radioisotopes, present, a, significant, health, and, environmental, hazard, caesium, is, the, spelling, recommended, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, the, american, chemical, society, acs, has, used, the, spelling, cesium, since, 1921, following, webster, s, new, international, dictionary, the, element, was, named, after, the, latin, word, caesius, meaning, bluish, grey, in, medieval, and, early, modern, writings, caesius, was, spelled, with, the, ligature, as, c, sius, hence, an, alternative, but, now, old, fashioned, orthography, is, c, sium, more, spelling, explanation, at, ae, oe, vs, e, of, all, elements, that, are, solid, at, room, temperature, caesium, is, the, softest, it, has, a, hardness, of, 0, 2, mohs, it, is, a, very, ductile, pale, metal, which, darkens, in, the, presence, of, trace, amounts, of, oxygen, when, in, the, presence, of, mineral, oil, where, it, is, best, kept, during, transport, it, loses, its, metallic, lustre, and, takes, on, a, duller, grey, appearance, it, has, a, melting, point, of, 28, 5, c, 83, 3, f, making, it, one, of, the, few, elemental, metals, that, are, liquid, near, room, temperature, the, others, are, rubidium, 39, c, francium, estimated, at, 27, c, mercury, 39, c, and, gallium, 30, c, bromine, is, also, liquid, at, room, temperature, melting, at, 7, 2, c, but, it, is, a, halogen, and, not, a, metal, mercury, is, the, only, stable, elemental, metal, with, a, known, melting, point, lower, than, caesium, in, addition, the, metal, has, a, rather, low, boiling, point, 641, c, 1, 186, f, the, lowest, of, all, stable, metals, other, than, mercury, copernicium, and, flerovium, have, been, predicted, to, have, lower, boiling, points, than, mercury, and, caesium, but, they, are, extremely, radioactive, and, it, is, not, certain, if, they, are, metals, caesium, forms, alloys, with, the, other, alkali, metals, gold, and, mercury, amalgams, at, temperatures, below, 650, c, 1, 202, f, it, does, not, alloy, with, cobalt, iron, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, tantalum, or, tungsten, it, forms, well, defined, intermetallic, compounds, with, antimony, gallium, indium, and, thorium, which, are, photosensitive, it, mixes, with, all, the, other, alkali, metals, except, lithium, the, alloy, with, a, molar, distribution, of, 41, caesium, 47, potassium, and, 12, sodium, has, the, lowest, melting, point, of, any, known, metal, alloy, at, 78, c, 108, f, a, few, amalgams, have, been, studied, cshg, 2, is, black, with, a, purple, metallic, lustre, while, cshg, is, golden, coloured, also, with, a, metallic, lustre, the, golden, colour, of, caesium, comes, from, the, decreasing, frequency, of, light, required, to, excite, electrons, of, the, alkali, metals, as, the, group, is, descended, for, lithium, through, rubidium, this, frequency, is, in, the, ultraviolet, but, for, caesium, it, enters, the, blue, violet, end, of, the, spectrum, in, other, words, the, plasmonic, frequency, of, the, alkali, metals, becomes, lower, from, lithium, to, caesium, thus, caesium, transmits, and, partially, absorbs, violet, light, preferentially, while, other, colours, having, lower, frequency, are, reflected, hence, it, appears, yellowish, its, compounds, burn, with, a, blue, or, violet, colour, caesium, exists, in, the, form, of, different, allotropes, one, of, them, a, dimer, called, dicaesium, caesium, metal, is, highly, reactive, and, pyrophoric, it, ignites, spontaneously, in, air, and, reacts, explosively, with, water, even, at, low, temperatures, more, so, than, the, other, alkali, metals, it, reacts, with, ice, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 116, c, 177, f, because, of, this, high, reactivity, caesium, metal, is, classified, as, a, hazardous, material, it, is, stored, and, shipped, in, dry, saturated, hydrocarbons, such, as, mineral, oil, it, can, be, handled, only, under, inert, gas, such, as, argon, however, a, caesium, water, explosion, is, often, less, powerful, than, a, sodium, water, explosion, with, a, similar, amount, of, sodium, this, is, because, caesium, explodes, instantly, upon, contact, with, water, leaving, little, time, for, hydrogen, to, accumulate, caesium, can, be, stored, in, vacuum, sealed, borosilicate, glass, ampoules, in, quantities, of, more, than, about, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, caesium, is, shipped, in, hermetically, sealed, stainless, steel, containers, the, chemistry, of, caesium, is, similar, to, that, of, other, alkali, metals, in, particular, rubidium, the, element, above, caesium, in, the, periodic, table, as, expected, for, an, alkali, metal, the, only, common, oxidation, state, is, 1, some, slight, differences, arise, from, the, fact, that, it, has, a, higher, atomic, mass, and, is, more, electropositive, than, other, nonradioactive, alkali, metals, caesium, is, the, most, electropositive, chemical, element, the, caesium, ion, is, also, larger, and, less, hard, than, those, of, the, lighter, alkali, metals, most, caesium, compounds, contain, the, element, as, the, cation, cs, which, binds, ionically, to, a, wide, variety, of, anions, one, noteworthy, exception, is, the, caeside, anion, cs, and, others, are, the, several, suboxides, see, section, on, oxides, below, more, recently, caesium, is, predicted, to, behave, as, a, p, block, element, and, capable, of, forming, higher, fluorides, with, higher, oxidation, states, i, e, csf, n, with, n, 1, under, high, pressure, this, prediction, needs, to, be, validated, by, further, experiments, salts, of, cs, are, usually, colourless, unless, the, anion, itself, is, coloured, many, of, the, simple, salts, are, hygroscopic, but, less, so, than, the, corresponding, salts, of, lighter, alkali, metals, the, phosphate, acetate, carbonate, halides, oxide, nitrate, and, sulfate, salts, are, water, soluble, its, double, salts, are, often, less, soluble, and, the, low, solubility, of, caesium, aluminium, sulfate, is, exploited, in, refining, cs, from, ores, the, double, salts, with, antimony, such, as, cssbcl, 4, bismuth, cadmium, copper, iron, and, lead, are, also, poorly, soluble, caesium, hydroxide, csoh, is, hygroscopic, and, strongly, basic, it, rapidly, etches, the, surface, of, semiconductors, such, as, silicon, csoh, has, been, previously, regarded, by, chemists, as, the, strongest, base, reflecting, the, relatively, weak, attraction, between, the, large, cs, ion, and, oh, it, is, indeed, the, strongest, arrhenius, base, however, a, number, of, compounds, such, as, n, butyllithium, sodium, amide, sodium, hydride, caesium, hydride, etc, which, cannot, be, dissolved, in, water, as, reacting, violently, with, it, but, rather, only, used, in, some, anhydrous, polar, aprotic, solvents, are, far, more, basic, on, the, basis, of, the, br, nsted, lowry, acid, base, theory, a, stoichiometric, mixture, of, caesium, and, gold, will, react, to, form, yellow, caesium, auride, cs, au, upon, heating, the, auride, anion, here, behaves, as, a, pseudohalogen, the, compound, reacts, violently, with, water, yielding, caesium, hydroxide, metallic, gold, and, hydrogen, gas, in, liquid, ammonia, it, can, be, reacted, with, a, caesium, specific, ion, exchange, resin, to, produce, tetramethylammonium, auride, the, analogous, platinum, compound, red, caesium, platinide, cs, 2, pt, contains, the, platinide, ion, that, behaves, as, a, pseudo, chalcogen, like, all, metal, cations, cs, forms, complexes, with, lewis, bases, in, solution, because, of, its, large, size, cs, usually, adopts, coordination, numbers, greater, than, 6, the, number, typical, for, the, smaller, alkali, metal, cations, this, difference, is, apparent, in, the, 8, coordination, of, cscl, this, high, coordination, number, and, softness, tendency, to, form, covalent, bonds, are, properties, exploited, in, separating, cs, from, other, cations, in, the, remediation, of, nuclear, wastes, where, 137, cs, must, be, separated, from, large, amounts, of, nonradioactive, k, caesium, fluoride, csf, is, a, hygroscopic, white, solid, that, is, widely, used, in, organofluorine, chemistry, as, a, source, of, fluoride, anions, caesium, fluoride, has, the, halite, structure, which, means, that, the, cs, and, f, pack, in, a, cubic, closest, packed, array, as, do, na, and, cl, in, sodium, chloride, notably, caesium, and, fluorine, have, the, lowest, and, highest, electronegativities, respectively, among, all, the, known, elements, caesium, chloride, cscl, crystallizes, in, the, simple, cubic, crystal, system, also, called, the, caesium, chloride, structure, this, structural, motif, is, composed, of, a, primitive, cubic, lattice, with, a, two, atom, basis, each, with, an, eightfold, coordination, the, chloride, atoms, lie, upon, the, lattice, points, at, the, edges, of, the, cube, while, the, caesium, atoms, lie, in, the, holes, in, the, centre, of, the, cubes, this, structure, is, shared, with, csbr, and, csi, and, many, other, compounds, that, do, not, contain, cs, in, contrast, most, other, alkaline, halides, have, the, sodium, chloride, nacl, structure, the, cscl, structure, is, preferred, because, cs, has, an, ionic, radius, of, 174, pm, and, cl, 181, pm, more, so, than, the, other, alkali, metals, caesium, forms, numerous, binary, compounds, with, oxygen, when, caesium, burns, in, air, the, superoxide, cso, 2, is, the, main, product, the, normal, caesium, oxide, cs, 2, o, forms, yellow, orange, hexagonal, crystals, and, is, the, only, oxide, of, the, anti, cdcl, 2, type, it, vaporizes, at, 250, c, 482, f, and, decomposes, to, caesium, metal, and, the, peroxide, cs, 2, o, 2, at, temperatures, above, 400, c, 752, f, in, addition, to, the, superoxide, and, the, ozonide, cso, 3, several, brightly, coloured, suboxides, have, also, been, studied, these, include, cs, 7, o, cs, 4, o, cs, 11, o, 3, cs, 3, o, dark, green, cso, cs, 3, o, 2, as, well, as, cs, 7, o, 2, the, latter, may, be, heated, in, a, vacuum, to, generate, cs, 2, o, binary, compounds, with, sulfur, selenium, and, tellurium, also, exist, caesium, has, 41, known, isotopes, ranging, in, mass, number, i, e, number, of, nucleons, in, the, nucleus, from, 112, to, 152, several, of, these, are, synthesized, from, lighter, elements, by, the, slow, neutron, capture, process, s, process, inside, old, stars, and, by, the, r, process, in, supernova, explosions, the, only, stable, caesium, isotope, is, 133, cs, with, 78, neutrons, although, it, has, a, large, nuclear, spin, 7, 2, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, studies, can, use, this, isotope, at, a, resonating, frequency, of, 11, 7, mhz, the, radioactive, 135, cs, has, a, very, long, half, life, of, about, 2, 3, million, years, the, longest, of, all, radioactive, isotopes, of, caesium, 137, cs, and, 134, cs, have, half, lives, of, 30, and, two, years, respectively, 137, cs, decomposes, to, a, short, lived, 137m, ba, by, beta, decay, and, then, to, nonradioactive, barium, while, 134, cs, transforms, into, 134, ba, directly, the, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, of, 129, 131, 132, and, 136, have, half, lives, between, a, day, and, two, weeks, while, most, of, the, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, from, a, few, seconds, to, fractions, of, a, second, at, least, 21, metastable, nuclear, isomers, exist, other, than, 134m, cs, with, a, half, life, of, just, under, 3, hours, all, are, very, unstable, and, decay, with, half, lives, of, a, few, minutes, or, less, the, isotope, 135, cs, is, one, of, the, long, lived, fission, products, of, uranium, produced, in, nuclear, reactors, however, this, fission, product, yield, is, reduced, in, most, reactors, because, the, predecessor, 135, xe, is, a, potent, neutron, poison, and, frequently, transmutes, to, stable, 136, xe, before, it, can, decay, to, 135, cs, the, beta, decay, from, 137, cs, to, 137m, ba, results, in, gamma, radiation, as, the, 137m, ba, relaxes, to, ground, state, 137, ba, with, the, emitted, photons, having, an, energy, of, 0, 6617, mev, 137, cs, and, 90, sr, are, the, principal, medium, lived, products, of, nuclear, fission, and, the, prime, sources, of, radioactivity, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, after, several, years, of, cooling, lasting, several, hundred, years, those, two, isotopes, are, the, largest, source, of, residual, radioactivity, in, the, area, of, the, chernobyl, disaster, because, of, the, low, capture, rate, disposing, of, 137, cs, through, neutron, capture, is, not, feasible, and, the, only, current, solution, is, to, allow, it, to, decay, over, time, almost, all, caesium, produced, from, nuclear, fission, comes, from, the, beta, decay, of, originally, more, neutron, rich, fission, products, passing, through, various, isotopes, of, iodine, and, xenon, because, iodine, and, xenon, are, volatile, and, can, diffuse, through, nuclear, fuel, or, air, radioactive, caesium, is, often, created, far, from, the, original, site, of, fission, with, nuclear, weapons, testing, in, the, 1950s, through, the, 1980s, 137, cs, was, released, into, the, atmosphere, and, returned, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, as, a, component, of, radioactive, fallout, it, is, a, ready, marker, of, the, movement, of, soil, and, sediment, from, those, times, caesium, is, a, relatively, rare, element, estimated, to, average, 3, parts, per, million, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, is, the, 45th, most, abundant, element, and, 36th, among, the, metals, caesium, is, 30, times, less, abundant, than, rubidium, with, which, it, is, closely, associated, chemically, due, to, its, large, ionic, radius, caesium, is, one, of, the, incompatible, elements, during, magma, crystallization, caesium, is, concentrated, in, the, liquid, phase, and, crystallizes, last, therefore, the, largest, deposits, of, caesium, are, zone, pegmatite, ore, bodies, formed, by, this, enrichment, process, because, caesium, does, not, substitute, for, potassium, as, readily, as, rubidium, does, the, alkali, evaporite, minerals, sylvite, kcl, and, carnallite, kmgcl, 3, 6h, 2, o, may, contain, only, 0, 002, caesium, consequently, caesium, is, found, in, few, minerals, percentage, amounts, of, caesium, may, be, found, in, beryl, be, 3, al, 2, sio, 3, 6, and, avogadrite, k, cs, bf, 4, up, to, 15, wt, cs, 2, o, in, the, closely, related, mineral, pezzottaite, cs, be, 2, li, al, 2, si, 6, o, 18, up, to, 8, 4, wt, cs, 2, o, in, the, rare, mineral, londonite, cs, k, al, 4, be, 4, b, be, 12, o, 28, and, less, in, the, more, widespread, rhodizite, the, only, economically, important, ore, for, caesium, is, pollucite, cs, alsi, 2, o, 6, which, is, found, in, a, few, places, around, the, world, in, zoned, pegmatites, associated, with, the, more, commercially, important, lithium, minerals, lepidolite, and, petalite, within, the, pegmatites, the, large, grain, size, and, the, strong, separation, of, the, minerals, results, in, high, grade, ore, for, mining, the, world, s, most, significant, and, richest, known, source, of, caesium, is, the, tanco, mine, at, bernic, lake, in, manitoba, canada, estimated, to, contain, 350, 000, metric, tons, of, pollucite, ore, representing, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, reserve, base, although, the, stoichiometric, content, of, caesium, in, pollucite, is, 42, 6, pure, pollucite, samples, from, this, deposit, contain, only, about, 34, caesium, while, the, average, content, is, 24, wt, commercial, pollucite, contains, more, than, 19, caesium, the, bikita, pegmatite, deposit, in, zimbabwe, is, mined, for, its, petalite, but, it, also, contains, a, significant, amount, of, pollucite, another, notable, source, of, pollucite, is, in, the, karibib, desert, namibia, at, the, present, rate, of, world, mine, production, of, 5, to, 10, metric, tons, per, year, reserves, will, last, for, thousands, of, years, mining, and, refining, pollucite, ore, is, a, selective, process, and, is, conducted, on, a, smaller, scale, than, for, most, other, metals, the, ore, is, crushed, hand, sorted, but, not, usually, concentrated, and, then, ground, caesium, is, then, extracted, from, pollucite, primarily, by, three, methods, acid, digestion, alkaline, decomposition, and, direct, reduction, in, the, acid, digestion, the, silicate, pollucite, rock, is, dissolved, with, strong, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, hcl, sulfuric, h, 2, so, 4, hydrobromic, hbr, or, hydrofluoric, hf, acids, with, hydrochloric, acid, a, mixture, of, soluble, chlorides, is, produced, and, the, insoluble, chloride, double, salts, of, caesium, are, precipitated, as, caesium, antimony, chloride, cs, 4, sbcl, 7, caesium, iodine, chloride, cs, 2, icl, or, caesium, hexachlorocerate, cs, 2, cecl, 6, after, separation, the, pure, precipitated, double, salt, is, decomposed, and, pure, cscl, is, precipitated, by, evaporating, the, water, the, sulfuric, acid, method, yields, the, insoluble, double, salt, directly, as, caesium, alum, csal, so, 4, 2, 12h, 2, o, the, aluminium, sulfate, component, is, converted, to, insoluble, aluminium, oxide, by, roasting, the, alum, with, carbon, and, the, resulting, product, is, leached, with, water, to, yield, a, cs, 2, so, 4, solution, roasting, pollucite, with, calcium, carbonate, and, calcium, chloride, yields, insoluble, calcium, silicates, and, soluble, caesium, chloride, leaching, with, water, or, dilute, ammonia, nh, 4, oh, yields, a, dilute, chloride, cscl, solution, this, solution, can, be, evaporated, to, produce, caesium, chloride, or, transformed, into, caesium, alum, or, caesium, carbonate, though, not, commercially, feasible, the, ore, can, be, directly, reduced, with, potassium, sodium, or, calcium, in, vacuum, to, produce, caesium, metal, directly, most, of, the, mined, caesium, as, salts, is, directly, converted, into, caesium, formate, hcoo, cs, for, applications, such, as, oil, drilling, to, supply, the, developing, market, cabot, corporation, built, a, production, plant, in, 1997, at, the, tanco, mine, near, bernic, lake, in, manitoba, with, a, capacity, of, 12, 000, barrels, 1, 900, m, 3, per, year, of, caesium, formate, solution, the, primary, smaller, scale, commercial, compounds, of, caesium, are, caesium, chloride, and, nitrate, alternatively, caesium, metal, may, be, obtained, from, the, purified, compounds, derived, from, the, ore, caesium, chloride, and, the, other, caesium, halides, can, be, reduced, at, 700, to, 800, c, 1, 292, to, 1, 472, f, with, calcium, or, barium, and, caesium, metal, distilled, from, the, result, in, the, same, way, the, aluminate, carbonate, or, hydroxide, may, be, reduced, by, magnesium, the, metal, can, also, be, isolated, by, electrolysis, of, fused, caesium, cyanide, cscn, exceptionally, pure, and, gas, free, caesium, can, be, produced, by, 390, c, 734, f, thermal, decomposition, of, caesium, azide, csn, 3, which, can, be, produced, from, aqueous, caesium, sulfate, and, barium, azide, in, vacuum, applications, caesium, dichromate, can, be, reacted, with, zirconium, to, produce, pure, caesium, metal, without, other, gaseous, products, the, price, of, 99, 8, pure, caesium, metal, basis, in, 2009, was, about, 10, per, gram, 280, oz, but, the, compounds, are, significantly, cheaper, in, 1860, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, discovered, caesium, in, the, mineral, water, from, d, rkheim, germany, because, of, the, bright, blue, lines, in, the, emission, spectrum, they, derived, the, name, from, the, latin, word, caesius, meaning, bluish, grey, caesium, was, the, first, element, to, be, discovered, with, a, spectroscope, which, had, been, invented, by, bunsen, and, kirchhoff, only, a, year, previously, to, obtain, a, pure, sample, of, caesium, 44, 000, litres, 9, 700, imp, gal, 12, 000, us, gal, of, mineral, water, had, to, be, evaporated, to, yield, 240, kilograms, 530, lb, of, concentrated, salt, solution, the, alkaline, earth, metals, were, precipitated, either, as, sulfates, or, oxalates, leaving, the, alkali, metal, in, the, solution, after, conversion, to, the, nitrates, and, extraction, with, ethanol, a, sodium, free, mixture, was, obtained, from, this, mixture, the, lithium, was, precipitated, by, ammonium, carbonate, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, form, insoluble, salts, with, chloroplatinic, acid, but, these, salts, show, a, slight, difference, in, solubility, in, hot, water, and, the, less, soluble, caesium, and, rubidium, hexachloroplatinate, cs, rb, 2, ptcl, 6, were, obtained, by, fractional, crystallization, after, reduction, of, the, hexachloroplatinate, with, hydrogen, caesium, and, rubidium, were, separated, by, the, difference, in, solubility, of, their, carbonates, in, alcohol, the, process, yielded, 9, 2, grams, 0, 32, oz, of, rubidium, chloride, and, 7, 3, grams, 0, 26, oz, of, caesium, chloride, from, the, initial, 44, 000, litres, of, mineral, water, from, the, caesium, chloride, the, two, scientists, estimated, the, atomic, weight, of, the, new, element, at, 123, 35, compared, to, the, currently, accepted, one, of, 132, 9, they, tried, to, generate, elemental, caesium, by, electrolysis, of, molten, caesium, chloride, but, instead, of, a, metal, they, obtained, a, blue, homogeneous, substance, which, neither, under, the, naked, eye, nor, under, the, microscope, showed, the, slightest, trace, of, metallic, substance, as, a, result, they, assigned, it, as, a, subchloride, cs, 2, cl, in, reality, the, product, was, probably, a, colloidal, mixture, of, the, metal, and, caesium, chloride, the, electrolysis, of, the, aqueous, solution, of, chloride, with, a, mercury, cathode, produced, a, caesium, amalgam, which, readily, decomposed, under, the, aqueous, conditions, the, pure, metal, was, eventually, isolated, by, the, swedish, chemist, carl, setterberg, while, working, on, his, doctorate, with, kekul, and, bunsen, in, 1882, he, produced, caesium, metal, by, electrolysing, caesium, cyanide, avoiding, the, problems, with, the, chloride, historically, the, most, important, use, for, caesium, has, been, in, research, and, development, primarily, in, chemical, and, electrical, fields, very, few, applications, existed, for, caesium, until, the, 1920s, when, it, came, into, use, in, radio, vacuum, tubes, where, it, had, two, functions, as, a, getter, it, removed, excess, oxygen, after, manufacture, and, as, a, coating, on, the, heated, cathode, it, increased, the, electrical, conductivity, caesium, was, not, recognized, as, a, high, performance, industrial, metal, until, the, 1950s, applications, for, nonradioactive, caesium, included, photoelectric, cells, photomultiplier, tubes, optical, components, of, infrared, spectrophotometers, catalysts, for, several, organic, reactions, crystals, for, scintillation, counters, and, in, magnetohydrodynamic, power, generators, caesium, is, also, used, as, a, source, of, positive, ions, in, secondary, ion, mass, spectrometry, sims, since, 1967, the, international, system, of, measurements, has, based, the, primary, unit, of, time, the, second, on, the, properties, of, caesium, the, international, system, of, units, si, defines, the, second, as, the, duration, of, 9, 192, 631, 770, cycles, at, the, microwave, frequency, of, the, spectral, line, corresponding, to, the, transition, between, two, hyperfine, energy, levels, of, the, ground, state, of, caesium, 133, the, 13th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, of, 1967, defined, a, second, as, the, duration, of, 9, 192, 631, 770, cycles, of, microwave, light, absorbed, or, emitted, by, the, hyperfine, transition, of, caesium, 133, atoms, in, their, ground, state, undisturbed, by, external, fields, the, largest, present, day, use, of, nonradioactive, caesium, is, in, caesium, formate, drilling, fluids, for, the, extractive, oil, industry, aqueous, solutions, of, caesium, formate, hcoo, cs, made, by, reacting, caesium, hydroxide, with, formic, acid, were, developed, in, the, mid, 1990s, for, use, as, oil, well, drilling, and, completion, fluids, the, function, of, a, drilling, fluid, is, to, lubricate, drill, bits, to, bring, rock, cuttings, to, the, surface, and, to, maintain, pressure, on, the, formation, during, drilling, of, the, well, completion, fluids, assist, the, emplacement, of, control, hardware, after, drilling, but, prior, to, production, by, maintaining, the, pressure, the, high, density, of, the, caesium, formate, brine, up, to, 2, 3, g, cm, 3, or, 19, 2, pounds, per, gallon, coupled, with, the, relatively, benign, nature, of, most, caesium, compounds, reduces, the, requirement, for, toxic, high, density, suspended, solids, in, the, drilling, fluid, a, significant, technological, engineering, and, environmental, advantage, unlike, the, components, of, many, other, heavy, liquids, caesium, formate, is, relatively, environment, friendly, caesium, formate, brine, can, be, blended, with, potassium, and, sodium, formates, to, decrease, the, density, of, the, fluids, to, that, of, water, 1, 0, g, cm, 3, or, 8, 3, pounds, per, gallon, furthermore, it, is, biodegradable, and, may, be, recycled, which, is, important, in, view, of, its, high, cost, about, 4, 000, per, barrel, in, 2001, alkali, formates, are, safe, to, handle, and, do, not, damage, the, producing, formation, or, downhole, metals, as, corrosive, alternative, high, density, brines, such, as, zinc, bromide, znbr, 2, solutions, sometimes, do, they, also, require, less, cleanup, and, reduce, disposal, costs, caesium, based, atomic, clocks, use, the, electromagnetic, transitions, in, the, hyperfine, structure, of, caesium, 133, atoms, as, a, reference, point, the, first, accurate, caesium, clock, was, built, by, louis, essen, in, 1955, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, in, the, uk, caesium, clocks, have, improved, over, the, past, half, century, and, are, regarded, as, the, most, accurate, realization, of, a, unit, that, mankind, has, yet, achieved, these, clocks, measure, frequency, with, an, error, of, 2, to, 3, parts, in, 10, 14, which, corresponds, to, an, accuracy, of, 2, nanoseconds, per, day, or, one, second, in, 1, 4, million, years, the, latest, versions, are, more, accurate, than, 1, part, in, 10, 15, about, 1, second, in, 20, million, years, the, caesium, standard, is, the, primary, standard, for, standards, compliant, time, and, frequency, measurements, caesium, clocks, regulate, the, timing, of, cell, phone, networks, and, the, internet, the, second, symbol, s, is, the, si, unit, of, time, the, bipm, restated, its, definition, at, its, 26th, conference, in, 2018, is, defined, by, taking, the, fixed, numerical, value, of, the, caesium, frequency, cs, the, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, to, be, 9, 192, 631, 770, when, expressed, in, the, unit, hz, which, is, equal, to, s, 1, caesium, vapour, thermionic, generators,

niche, use, in, organic, chemistry, as, a, base, and, as, an, anhydrous, source, of, fluoride, ion, caesium, salts, sometimes, replace, potassium, or, sodium, salts, in, organic, synthesis, such, as, cyclization, esterification, and, polymerization, caesium, has, also, been, used, in, thermoluminescent, radiation, dosimetry, tld, when, exposed, to, radiation, it, acquires, crystal, defects, that, when, heated, revert, with, emission, of, light, proportionate, to, the, received, dose, thus, measuring, the, light, pulse, with, a, photomultiplier, tube, can, allow, the, accumulated, radiation, dose, to, be, quantified, caesium, 137, is, a, radioisotope, commonly, used, as, a, gamma, emitter, in, industrial, applications, its, advantages, include, a, half, life, of, roughly, 30, years, its, availability, from, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, and, having, 137, ba, as, a, stable, end, product, the, high, water, solubility, is, a, disadvantage, which, makes, it, incompatible, with, large, pool, irradiators, for, food, and, medical, supplies, it, has, been, used, in, agriculture, cancer, treatment, and, the, sterilization, of, food, sewage, sludge, and, surgical, equipment, radioactive, isotopes, of, caesium, in, radiation, devices, were, used, in, the, medical, field, to, treat, certain, types, of, cancer, but, emergence, of, better, alternatives, and, the, use, of, water, soluble, caesium, chloride, in, the, sources, which, could, create, wide, ranging, contamination, gradually, put, some, of, these, caesium, sources, out, of, use, caesium, 137, has, been, employed, in, a, variety, of, industrial, measurement, gauges, including, moisture, density, levelling, and, thickness, gauges, it, has, also, been, used, in, well, logging, devices, for, measuring, the, electron,

a, daughter, product, of, fission, bomb, testing, from, the, 1950s, through, the, mid, 1980s, caesium, 137, was, released, into, the, atmosphere, where, it, was, absorbed, readily, into, solution, known, year, to, year, variation, within, that, period, allows, correlation, with, soil, and, sediment, layers, caesium, 134, and, to, a, lesser, extent, caesium, 135, have, also, been, used, in, hydrology, to, measure, the, caesium, output, by, the, nuclear, power, industry, while, they, are, less, prevalent, than, either, caesium, 133, or, caesium, 137, these, bellwether, isotopes, are, produced, solely, from, anthropogenic, sources, caesium, and, mercury, were, used, as, a, propellant, in, early, ion, engines, designed, for, spacecraft, propulsion, on, very, long, interplanetary, or, extraplanetary, missions, the, fuel, was, ionized, by, contact, with, a, charged, tungsten, electrode, but, corrosion, by, caesium, on, spacecraft, components, has, pushed, development, in, the, direction, of, inert, gas, propellants, such, as, xenon, which, are, easier, to, handle, in, ground, based, tests, and, do, less, potential, damage, to, the, spacecraft, xenon, was, used, in, the, experimental, spacecraft, deep, space, 1, launched, in, 1998, nevertheless, field, emission, electric, propulsion, thrusters, that, accelerate, liquid, metal, ions, such, as, caesium, have, been, built, caesium, nitrate, is, used, as, an, oxidizer, and, pyrotechnic, colorant, to, burn, silicon, in, infrared, flares, such, as, the, luu, 19, flare, because, it, emits, much, of, its, light, in,

chloride, the, principal, use, of, nonradioactive, caesium, is, as, caesium, formate, in, petroleum, drilling, fluids, because, it, is, much, less, toxic, than, alternatives, though, it, is, more, costly, caesium, is, one, of, the, most, reactive, elements, and, is, highly, explosive, in, the, presence, of, water, the, hydrogen, gas, produced, by, the, reaction, is, heated, by, the, thermal, energy, released, at, the, same, time, causing, ignition, and, a, violent, explosion, this, can, occur, with, other, alkali, metals, but, caesium, is, so, potent, that, this, explosive, reaction, can, be, triggered, even, by, cold, water, it, is, highly, pyrophoric, the, autoignition, temperature, of, caesium, is, 116, c, 177, f, and, it, ignites, explosively, in, air, to, form, caesium, hydroxide, and, various, oxides, caesium, hydroxide, is, a, very, strong, base, and, will, rapidly, corrode, glass, the, isotopes, 134, and, 137, are, present, in, the, biosphere, in, small, amounts, from, human, activities, differing, by, location, radiocaesium, does, not, accumulate, in, the, body, as, readily, as, other, fission, products, such, as, radioiodine, and, radiostrontium, about, 10, of, absorbed, radiocaesium, washes, out, of, the, body, relatively, quickly, in, sweat, and, urine, the, remaining, 90, has, a, biological, half, life, between, 50, and, 150, days, radiocaesium, follows, potassium, and, tends, to, accumulate, in, plant, tissues, including, fruits, and, vegetables, plants, vary, widely, in, the, absorption, of, caesium, sometimes, displaying, great, resistance, to, it, it, is, also, well, documented, that, mushrooms, from, contaminated, forests, accumulate, radiocaesium, caesium, 137, in, the, fungal, sporocarps, accumulation, of, caesium, 137, in, lakes, has, been, a, great, concern, after, the, chernobyl, disaster, experiments, with, dogs, showed, that, a, single, dose, of, 3, 8, millicuries, 140, mbq, 4, 1, g, of, caesium, 137, per, kilogram, is, lethal, within, three, weeks, smaller, amounts, may, cause, infertility, and, cancer, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, and, other, sources, have, warned, that, radioactive, materials, such, as, caesium, 137, could, be, used, in, radiological, dispersion, devices, or, dirty, bombs
