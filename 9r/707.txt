prairies, are, ecosystems, considered, part, of, the, temperate, grasslands, savannas, and, shrublands, biome, by, ecologists, based, on, similar, temperate, climates, moderate, rainfall, and, a, composition, of, grasses, herbs, and, shrubs, rather, than, trees, as, the, dominant, vegetation, type, temperate, grassland, regions, include, the, pampas, of, argentina, brazil, and, uruguay, and, the, steppe, of, ukraine, russia, and, kazakhstan, lands, typically, referred, to, as, prairie, tend, to, be, in, north, america, the, term, encompasses, the, lower, and, mid, latitude, of, the, area, referred, to, as, the, interior, plains, of, canada, the, united, states, and, mexico, it, includes, all, of, the, great, plains, as, well, as, the, wetter, hillier, land, to, the, east, from, west, to, east, generally, the, drier, expanse, of, shortgrass, prairie, gives, way, to, mixed, grass, prairie, and, ultimately, the, richer, soils, of, the, tallgrass, prairie, in, the, u, s, the, area, is, constituted, by, most, or, all, of, the, states, from, north, to, south, of, north, dakota, south, dakota, nebraska, kansas, and, oklahoma, and, sizable, parts, of, the, states, of, montana, wyoming, colorado, new, mexico, texas, in, the, west, and, to, the, east, minnesota, wisconsin, iowa, missouri, illinois, and, indiana, the, palouse, of, washington, and, the, central, valley, of, california, are, also, prairies, the, canadian, prairies, occupy, vast, areas, of, manitoba, saskatchewan, and, alberta, prairies, may, contain, various, lush, flora, and, fauna, often, contain, rich, soil, maintained, by, biodiversity, with, a, temperate, climate, and, a, varied, view, according, to, theodore, roosevelt, we, have, taken, into, our, language, the, word, prairie, because, when, our, backwoodsmen, first, reached, the, land, and, saw, the, great, natural, meadows, of, long, grass, sights, unknown, to, the, gloomy, forests, wherein, they, had, always, dwelt, they, knew, not, what, to, call, them, and, borrowed, the, term, already, in, use, among, the, french, inhabitants, prairie, pronounced, is, the, french, word, for, meadow, formed, ultimately, from, the, latin, root, word, pratum, same, meaning, the, formation, of, the, north, american, prairies, started, with, the, uplift, of, the, rocky, mountains, near, alberta, the, mountains, created, a, rain, shadow, which, resulted, in, lower, precipitation, rates, downwind, the, parent, material, of, most, prairie, soil, was, distributed, during, the, last, glacial, advance, that, began, about, 110, 000, years, ago, the, glaciers, expanding, southward, scraped, the, landscape, picking, up, geologic, material, and, leveling, the, terrain, as, the, glaciers, retreated, about, 10, 000, years, ago, they, deposited, this, material, in, the, form, of, till, wind, based, loess, deposits, also, form, an, important, parent, material, for, prairie, soils, tallgrass, prairie, evolved, over, tens, of, thousands, of, years, with, the, disturbances, of, grazing, and, fire, native, ungulates, such, as, bison, elk, and, white, tailed, deer, roamed, the, expansive, diverse, grasslands, before, european, colonization, of, the, americas, for, 10, 000, 20, 000, years, native, people, used, fire, annually, as, a, tool, to, assist, in, hunting, transportation, and, safety, evidence, of, ignition, sources, of, fire, in, the, tall, grass, prairie, are, overwhelmingly, human, as, opposed, to, lightning, humans, and, grazing, animals, were, active, participants, in, the, process, of, prairie, formation, and, the, establishment, of, the, diversity, of, graminoid, and, forbs, species, fire, has, the, effect, on, prairies, of, removing, trees, clearing, dead, plant, matter, and, changing, the, availability, of, certain, nutrients, in, the, soil, from, the, ash, produced, fire, kills, the, vascular, tissue, of, trees, but, not, prairie, species, as, up, to, 75, depending, on, the, species, of, the, total, plant, biomass, is, below, the, soil, surface, and, will, re, grow, from, its, deep, upwards, of, 20, feet, roots, without, disturbance, trees, will, encroach, on, a, grassland, and, cast, shade, which, suppresses, the, understory, prairie, and, widely, spaced, oak, trees, evolved, to, coexist, in, the, oak, savanna, ecosystem, prairie, ecosystems, in, the, united, states, and, canada, are, divided, into, the, easternmost, tallgrass, prairie, the, westernmost, shortgrass, prairie, and, the, central, mixed, grass, prairie, tallgrass, prairies, receive, over, 30, inches, of, rainfall, per, year, whereas, shortgrass, prairies, are, much, more, arid, receiving, only, 12, inches, or, so, and, mixed, grass, prairies, receive, intermediate, rainfall, wet, mesic, and, dry, prairie, ecosystems, can, also, form, more, locally, due, to, soil, and, terrain, characteristics, wet, prairies, may, form, in, low, lying, areas, with, poor, drainage, dry, prairie, can, be, found, on, uplands, or, slopes, dry, prairie, is, the, dominant, habitat, type, in, the, southern, canadian, agricultural, and, climatic, region, which, is, known, as, palliser, s, triangle, it, was, once, thought, to, be, completely, unarable, but, is, now, one, of, the, most, important, agricultural, regions, in, canada, thanks, to, advances, in, irrigation, technology, the, dominant, plant, life, in, prairies, consists, of, grasses, which, may, include, 40, to, 60, different, grass, species, in, addition, to, grasses, prairies, can, include, over, 300, species, of, flowering, plants, the, konza, tallgrass, prairie, in, kansas, hosts, 250, species, of, native, plants, and, provides, habitat, for, 208, birds, 27, mammals, 25, reptiles, and, over, 3, 000, insects, some, of, the, dominant, grasses, of, prairies, are, indian, grass, big, bluestem, side, oats, grama, canada, wildrye, and, switchgrass, prairies, are, considered, to, be, fire, dependent, ecosystems, regular, controlled, burning, by, native, americans, practices, developed, through, observation, of, non, anthropogenic, fire, and, its, effects, maintained, the, biodiversity, of, the, prairie, clearing, away, dead, vegetation, and, preventing, trees, from, shading, out, the, diverse, grasses, and, herbaceous, plants, prairies, also, depend, on, the, presence, of, large, grazing, animals, particularly, bison, bison, are, important, to, the, prairie, ecosystem, because, they, shape, and, alter, the, environment, by, grazing, trampling, areas, with, their, hooves, wallowing, and, depositing, manure, bison, eat, more, grass, than, flowering, plants, increasing, the, diversity, of, plants, in, the, prairie, cattle, are, thought, to, prefer, to, eat, flowering, plants, over, grasses, but, it, is, not, known, if, that, is, because, of, inherent, differences, in, the, species, or, because, farmed, cattle, tend, to, be, confined, in, smaller, areas, bison, dung, is, a, vital, source, of, nutrients, for, prairie, soil, spreads, seeds, and, supports, over, 1, 000, insect, species, including, specialist, dung, beetles, which, cannot, subsist, on, the, feces, of, any, other, animal, in, spite, of, long, recurrent, droughts, and, occasional, torrential, rains, the, grasslands, of, the, great, plains, were, not, subject, to, great, soil, erosion, the, root, systems, of, native, prairie, grasses, firmly, held, the, soil, in, place, to, prevent, run, off, of, soil, when, the, plant, died, the, fungi, and, bacteria, returned, its, nutrients, to, the, soil, these, deep, roots, also, helped, native, prairie, plants, reach, water, in, even, the, driest, conditions, native, grasses, suffer, much, less, damage, from, dry, conditions, than, many, farm, crops, currently, grown, when, the, eastern, tallgrass, prairies, were, plowed, and, turned, into, agricultural, lands, the, prairie, grasses, with, their, strong, root, systems, were, destroyed, in, combination, with, severe, droughts, that, resulted, in, the, dust, bowl, a, major, ecological, disaster, in, which, winds, picked, up, the, dry, unprotected, prairie, soil, and, formed, it, into, black, blizzards, of, airborne, dirt, that, blackened, the, skies, for, days, at, a, time, across, 19, states, and, forced, 400, 000, people, to, abandon, the, great, plains, ecoregion, the, dust, bowl, was, a, major, reason, for, the, great, depression, nomadic, hunting, has, been, the, main, human, activity, on, the, prairies, for, the, majority, of, the, archaeological, record, this, once, included, many, now, extinct, species, of, megafauna, after, the, other, extinctions, the, main, hunted, animal, on, the, prairies, was, the, plains, bison, using, loud, noises, and, waving, large, signals, native, peoples, would, drive, bison, into, fenced, pens, called, buffalo, pounds, to, be, killed, with, bows, and, arrows, or, spears, or, drive, them, off, a, cliff, called, a, buffalo, jump, to, kill, or, injure, the, bison, en, masse, the, introduction, of, the, horse, and, the, gun, greatly, expanded, the, killing, power, of, the, plains, natives, that, was, followed, by, the, policy, of, indiscriminate, killing, by, european, americans, and, canadians, for, both, commercial, reasons, and, to, weaken, the, independence, of, plains, natives, and, caused, a, dramatic, drop, in, bison, numbers, from, millions, to, a, few, hundred, in, a, century, s, time, and, almost, caused, their, extinction, the, very, dense, soil, plagued, the, first, european, settlers, who, were, using, wooden, plows, which, were, more, suitable, for, loose, forest, soil, on, the, prairie, the, plows, bounced, around, and, the, soil, stuck, to, them, this, problem, was, solved, in, 1837, by, an, illinois, blacksmith, named, john, deere, who, developed, a, steel, moldboard, plow, that, was, stronger, and, cut, the, roots, making, the, fertile, soils, ready, for, farming, former, grasslands, are, now, among, the, most, productive, agricultural, lands, on, earth, the, tallgrass, prairie, has, been, converted, into, one, of, the, most, intensive, crop, producing, areas, in, north, america, less, than, one, tenth, of, one, percent, 0, 09, of, the, original, landcover, of, the, tallgrass, prairie, biome, remains, much, of, what, persists, is, in, cemetery, prairies, railroad, rights, of, way, or, rocky, sandy, hilly, places, unsuitable, for, agriculture, states, formerly, with, landcover, in, native, tallgrass, prairie, including, iowa, illinois, minnesota, wisconsin, nebraska, and, missouri, have, become, valued, for, their, highly, productive, soils, and, are, included, in, the, corn, belt, as, an, example, of, this, land, use, intensity, illinois, and, iowa, rank, 49th, and, 50th, out, of, 50, us, states, in, total, uncultivated, land, remaining, drier, shortgrass, prairies, were, once, used, mostly, for, open, range, ranching, with, the, development, of, barbed, wire, in, the, 1870s, and, improved, irrigation, techniques, this, region, has, mostly, been, converted, to, cropland, and, small, fenced, pastures, in, southern, canada, palliser, s, triangle, has, been, changed, into, one, of, the, most, important, sources, of, wheat, in, the, world, as, a, result, of, improved, methods, of, watering, wheat, fields, along, with, the, rest, of, the, southern, prairie, provinces, which, also, grow, wheat, canola, and, many, other, grains, despite, those, advances, in, farming, technology, the, area, is, still, very, prone, to, extended, periods, of, drought, which, can, be, disastrous, for, the, industry, if, it, is, significantly, prolonged, research, by, david, tilman, ecologist, at, the, university, of, minnesota, suggests, biofuels, made, from, high, diversity, mixtures, of, prairie, plants, can, reduce, global, warming, by, removing, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, even, when, grown, on, infertile, soils, they, can, provide, a, substantial, portion, of, global, energy, needs, and, leave, fertile, land, for, food, production, unlike, corn, and, soybeans, which, are, both, directly, and, indirectly, major, food, crops, including, livestock, feed, prairie, grasses, are, not, used, for, human, consumption, prairie, grasses, can, be, grown, in, infertile, soil, eliminating, the, cost, of, adding, nutrients, to, the, soil, tilman, and, his, colleagues, estimate, that, prairie, grass, biofuels, would, yield, 51, percent, more, energy, per, acre, than, ethanol, from, corn, grown, on, fertile, land, some, plants, commonly, used, are, lupine, big, bluestem, turkey, foot, blazing, star, switchgrass, and, prairie, clover, because, rich, and, thick, topsoil, made, the, land, well, suited, for, agricultural, use, only, 1, of, tallgrass, prairie, remains, in, the, u, s, today, shortgrass, prairie, is, more, abundant, significant, preserved, areas, of, prairie, include, virgin, prairie, refers, to, prairie, land, which, has, never, been, plowed, small, virgin, prairies, exist, in, the, american, midwestern, states, and, in, canada, restored, prairie, refers, to, a, prairie, that, has, been, reseeded, after, plowing, or, other, disturbance, a, prairie, garden, is, a, garden, primarily, consisting, of, plants, from, a, prairie, the, originally, treeless, prairies, of, the, upper, mississippi, basin, began, in, indiana, and, extended, westward, and, north, westward, until, they, merged, with, the, drier, region, known, as, the, great, plains, an, eastward, extension, of, the, same, region, originally, tree, covered, extended, to, central, ohio, thus, the, prairies, generally, lie, between, the, ohio, and, missouri, rivers, on, the, south, and, the, great, lakes, on, the, north, the, prairies, are, a, contribution, of, the, glacial, period, they, consist, for, the, most, part, of, glacial, drift, deposited, unconformably, on, an, underlying, rock, surface, of, moderate, or, small, relief, here, the, rocks, are, an, extension, of, the, same, stratified, palaeozoic, formations, already, described, as, occurring, in, the, appalachian, region, and, around, the, great, lakes, they, are, usually, fine, textured, limestones, and, shales, lying, horizontal, the, moderate, or, small, relief, that, they, were, given, by, mature, preglacial, erosion, is, now, buried, under, the, drift, the, greatest, area, of, the, prairies, from, indiana, to, north, dakota, consists, of, till, plains, that, is, sheets, of, unstratified, drift, the, plains, are, 30, 50, or, even, 100, ft, up, to, 30, m, thick, covering, the, underlying, rock, surface, for, thousands, of, square, miles, except, where, postglacial, stream, erosion, has, locally, laid, it, bare, the, plains, have, an, extraordinarily, even, surface, the, till, is, presumably, made, in, part, of, preglacial, soils, but, it, is, more, largely, composed, of, rock, waste, mechanically, transported, by, the, creeping, ice, sheets, although, the, crystalline, rocks, from, canada, and, some, of, the, more, resistant, stratified, rocks, south, of, the, great, lakes, occur, as, boulders, and, stones, a, great, part, of, the, till, has, been, crushed, and, ground, to, a, clayey, texture, the, till, plains, although, sweeping, in, broad, swells, of, slowly, changing, altitude, often, appear, level, to, the, eye, with, a, view, stretching, to, the, horizon, here, and, there, faint, depressions, occur, occupied, by, marshy, sloughs, or, floored, with, a, rich, black, soil, of, postglacial, origin, it, is, thus, by, sub, glacial, aggradation, that, the, prairies, have, been, levelled, up, to, a, smooth, surface, in, contrast, to, the, higher, and, non, glaciated, hilly, country, just, to, the, south, the, great, ice, sheets, formed, terminal, moraines, around, their, border, at, various, end, stages, however, the, morainic, belts, are, of, small, relief, in, comparison, to, the, great, area, of, the, ice, they, rise, gently, from, the, till, plains, to, a, height, of, 50, 100, or, more, feet, they, may, be, one, two, or, three, miles, 5, km, wide, and, their, hilly, surface, dotted, over, with, boulders, contains, many, small, lakes, in, basins, or, hollows, instead, of, streams, in, valleys, the, morainic, belts, are, arranged, in, groups, of, concentric, loops, convex, southward, because, the, ice, sheets, advanced, in, lobes, along, the, lowlands, of, the, great, lakes, neighboring, morainic, loops, join, each, other, in, re, entrants, north, pointing, cusps, where, two, adjacent, glacial, lobes, came, together, and, formed, their, moraines, in, largest, volume, the, moraines, are, of, too, small, relief, to, be, shown, on, any, maps, except, of, the, largest, scale, small, as, they, are, they, are, the, chief, relief, of, the, prairie, states, and, in, association, with, the, nearly, imperceptible, slopes, of, the, till, plains, they, determine, the, course, of, many, streams, and, rivers, which, as, a, whole, are, consequent, upon, the, surface, form, of, the, glacial, deposits, the, complexity, of, the, glacial, period, and, its, subdivision, into, several, glacial, epochs, separated, by, interglacial, epochs, of, considerable, length, certainly, longer, than, the, postglacial, epoch, has, a, structural, consequence, in, the, superposition, of, successive, till, sheets, alternating, with, non, glacial, deposits, it, also, has, a, physiographic, consequence, in, the, very, different, amount, of, normal, postglacial, erosion, suffered, by, the, different, parts, of, the, glacial, deposits, the, southernmost, drift, sheets, as, in, southern, iowa, and, northern, missouri, have, lost, their, initially, plain, surface, and, are, now, maturely, dissected, into, gracefully, rolling, forms, here, the, valleys, of, even, the, small, streams, are, well, opened, and, graded, and, marshes, and, lakes, are, rare, these, sheets, are, of, early, pleistocene, origin, nearer, the, great, lakes, the, till, sheets, are, trenched, only, by, the, narrow, valleys, of, the, large, streams, marshy, sloughs, still, occupy, the, faint, depressions, in, the, till, plains, and, the, associated, moraines, have, abundant, small, lakes, in, their, undrained, hollows, these, drift, sheets, are, of, late, pleistocene, origin, when, the, ice, sheets, extended, to, the, land, sloping, southward, to, the, ohio, river, mississippi, river, and, missouri, river, the, drift, laden, streams, flowed, freely, away, from, the, ice, border, as, the, streams, escaped, from, their, subglacial, channels, they, spread, into, broader, channels, and, deposited, some, of, their, load, and, thus, aggraded, their, courses, local, sheets, or, aprons, of, gravel, and, sand, are, spread, more, or, less, abundantly, along, the, outer, side, of, the, morainic, belts, long, trains, of, gravel, and, sands, clog, the, valleys, that, lead, southward, from, the, glaciated, to, the, non, glaciated, area, later, when, the, ice, retreated, farther, and, the, unloaded, streams, returned, to, their, earlier, degrading, habit, they, more, or, less, completely, scoured, out, the, valley, deposits, the, remains, of, which, are, now, seen, in, terraces, on, either, side, of, the, present, flood, plains, when, the, ice, of, the, last, glacial, epoch, had, retreated, so, far, that, its, front, border, lay, on, a, northward, slope, belonging, to, the, drainage, area, of, the, great, lakes, bodies, of, water, accumulated, in, front, of, the, ice, margin, forming, glacio, marginal, lakes, the, lakes, were, small, at, first, and, each, had, its, own, outlet, at, the, lowest, depression, of, land, to, the, south, as, the, ice, melted, further, back, neighboring, lakes, became, confluent, at, the, level, of, the, lowest, outlet, of, the, group, the, outflowing, streams, grew, in, the, same, proportion, and, eroded, a, broad, channel, across, the, height, of, land, and, far, down, stream, while, the, lake, waters, built, sand, reefs, or, carved, shore, cliffs, along, their, margin, and, laid, down, sheets, of, clay, on, their, floors, all, of, these, features, are, easily, recognized, in, the, prairie, region, the, present, site, of, chicago, was, determined, by, an, indian, portage, or, carry, across, the, low, divide, between, lake, michigan, and, the, headwaters, of, the, illinois, river, this, divide, lies, on, the, floor, of, the, former, outlet, channel, of, the, glacial, lake, michigan, corresponding, outlets, are, known, for, lake, erie, lake, huron, and, lake, superior, a, very, large, sheet, of, water, named, lake, agassiz, once, overspread, a, broad, till, plain, in, northern, minnesota, and, north, dakota, the, outlet, of, this, glacial, lake, called, river, warren, eroded, a, large, channel, in, which, the, minnesota, river, evident, today, the, red, river, of, the, north, flows, northward, through, a, plain, formerly, covered, by, lake, agassiz, certain, extraordinary, features, were, produced, when, the, retreat, of, the, ice, sheet, had, progressed, so, far, as, to, open, an, eastward, outlet, for, the, marginal, lakes, this, outlet, occurred, along, the, depression, between, the, northward, slope, of, the, appalachian, plateau, in, west, central, new, york, and, the, southward, slope, of, the, melting, ice, sheet, when, this, eastward, outlet, came, to, be, lower, than, the, south, westward, outlet, across, the, height, of, land, to, the, ohio, or, mississippi, river, the, discharge, of, the, marginal, lakes, was, changed, from, the, mississippi, system, to, the, hudson, system, many, well, defined, channels, cutting, across, the, north, sloping, spurs, of, the, plateau, in, the, neighborhood, of, syracuse, new, york, mark, the, temporary, paths, of, the, ice, bordered, outlet, river, successive, channels, are, found, at, lower, and, lower, levels, on, the, plateau, slope, indicating, the, successive, courses, taken, by, the, lake, outlet, as, the, ice, melted, farther, and, farther, back, on, some, of, the, channels, deep, gorges, were, eroded, heading, in, temporary, cataracts, which, exceeded, niagara, in, height, but, not, in, breadth, the, pools, excavated, by, the, plunging, waters, at, the, head, of, the, gorges, are, now, occupied, by, little, lakes, the, most, significant, stage, in, this, series, of, changes, occurred, when, the, glacio, marginal, lake, waters, were, lowered, so, that, the, long, escarpment, of, niagara, limestone, was, laid, bare, in, western, new, york, the, previously, confluent, waters, were, then, divided, into, two, lakes, the, higher, one, lake, erie, supplied, the, outflowing, niagara, river, which, poured, its, waters, down, the, escarpment, to, the, lower, lake, ontario, that, gave, rise, to, niagara, falls, lake, ontario, s, outlet, for, a, time, ran, down, the, mohawk, valley, to, the, hudson, river, at, the, higher, elevation, it, was, known, as, lake, iroquois, when, ice, melted, from, the, northeastern, end, of, the, lake, it, dropped, to, a, lower, level, and, drained, through, the, st, lawrence, area, creating, a, lower, base, level, for, the, niagara, river, and, increasing, its, erosive, capacity, in, certain, districts, the, subglacial, till, was, not, spread, out, in, a, smooth, plain, but, accumulated, in, elliptical, mounds, 100, 200, feet, high, and, 0, 5, to, 1, mile, 0, 80, to, 1, 61, kilometres, long, with, axes, parallel, to, the, direction, of, the, ice, motion, as, indicated, by, striae, on, the, underlying, rock, floor, these, hills, are, known, by, the, irish, name, drumlins, used, for, similar, hills, in, north, western, ireland, the, most, remarkable, groups, of, drumlins, occur, in, western, new, york, where, their, number, is, estimated, at, over, 6, 000, and, in, southern, wisconsin, where, it, is, placed, at, 5, 000, they, completely, dominate, the, topography, of, their, districts, a, curious, deposit, of, an, impalpably, fine, and, unstratified, silt, known, by, the, german, name, bess, or, loess, lies, on, the, older, drift, sheets, near, the, larger, river, courses, of, the, upper, mississippi, basin, it, attains, a, thickness, of, 20, ft, 6, 1, m, or, more, near, the, rivers, and, gradually, fades, away, at, a, distance, of, ten, or, more, miles, 16, or, more, km, on, either, side, it, contains, land, shells, and, hence, cannot, be, attributed, to, marine, or, lacustrine, submergence, the, best, explanation, is, that, during, certain, phases, of, the, glacial, period, it, was, carried, as, dust, by, the, winds, from, the, flood, plains, of, aggrading, rivers, and, slowly, deposited, on, the, neighboring, grass, covered, plains, the, glacial, and, eolian, origin, of, this, sediment, is, evidenced, by, the, angularity, of, its, grains, a, bank, of, it, will, stand, without, slumping, for, years, whereas, if, it, had, been, transported, significantly, by, water, the, grains, would, have, been, rounded, and, polished, loess, is, parent, material, for, an, extremely, fertile, but, droughty, soil, southwestern, wisconsin, and, parts, of, the, adjacent, states, of, illinois, iowa, and, minnesota, are, known, as, the, driftless, zone, because, although, bordered, by, drift, sheets, and, moraines, it, is, free, from, glacial, deposits, it, must, therefore, have, been, a, sort, of, oasis, when, the, ice, sheets, from, the, north, advanced, past, it, on, the, east, and, west, and, joined, around, its, southern, border, the, reason, for, this, exemption, from, glaciation, is, the, converse, of, that, for, the, southward, convexity, of, the, morainic, loops, while, they, mark, the, paths, of, greatest, glacial, advance, along, lowland, troughs, lake, basins, the, driftless, zone, is, a, district, protected, from, ice, invasion, by, reason, of, the, obstruction, which, the, highlands, of, northern, wisconsin, and, michigan, part, of, the, superior, upland, offered, to, glacial, advance, the, course, of, the, upper, mississippi, river, is, largely, consequent, upon, glacial, deposits, its, sources, are, in, the, morainic, lakes, in, northern, minnesota, the, drift, deposits, thereabouts, are, so, heavy, that, the, present, divides, between, the, drainage, basins, of, hudson, bay, lake, superior, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, evidently, stand, in, no, very, definite, relation, to, the, preglacial, divides, the, course, of, the, mississippi, through, minnesota, is, largely, guided, by, the, form, of, the, drift, cover, several, rapids, and, the, saint, anthony, falls, determining, the, site, of, minneapolis, are, signs, of, immaturity, resulting, from, superposition, through, the, drift, on, the, under, rock, farther, south, as, far, as, the, entrance, of, the, ohio, river, the, mississippi, follows, a, rock, walled, valley, 300, to, 400, ft, 91, to, 122, m, deep, with, a, flood, plain, 2, to, 4, mi, 3, 2, to, 6, 4, km, wide, this, valley, seems, to, represent, the, path, of, an, enlarged, early, glacial, mississippi, when, much, precipitation, that, is, today, discharged, to, hudson, bay, and, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, was, delivered, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, for, the, curves, of, the, present, river, are, of, distinctly, smaller, radii, than, the, curves, of, the, valley, lake, pepin, 30, mi, below, st, paul, a, picturesque, expansion, of, the, river, across, its, flood, plain, is, due, to, the, aggradation, of, the, valley, floor, where, the, chippewa, river, coming, from, the, northeast, brought, an, overload, of, fluvio, glacial, drift, hence, even, the, father, of, waters, like, so, many, other, rivers, in, the, northern, states, owes, many, of, its, features, more, or, less, directly, to, glacial, action, the, fertility, of, the, prairies, is, a, natural, consequence, of, their, origin, during, the, mechanical, transportation, of, the, till, no, vegetation, was, present, to, remove, the, minerals, essential, to, plant, growth, as, is, the, case, in, the, soils, of, normally, weathered, and, dissected, peneplains, the, soil, is, similar, to, the, appalachian, piedmont, which, though, not, exhausted, by, the, primeval, forest, cover, are, by, no, means, so, rich, as, the, till, sheets, of, the, prairies, moreover, whatever, the, rocky, understructure, the, till, soil, has, been, averaged, by, a, thorough, mechanical, mixture, of, rock, grindings, hence, the, prairies, are, continuously, fertile, for, scores, of, miles, together, the, true, prairies, were, once, covered, with, a, rich, growth, of, natural, grass, and, annual, flowering, plants, but, today, they, are, covered, with, farms
