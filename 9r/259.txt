a, planetary, nebula, is, a, type, of, emission, nebula, consisting, of, an, expanding, glowing, shell, of, ionized, gas, ejected, from, red, giant, stars, late, in, their, lives, the, term, planetary, nebula, is, a, misnomer, because, they, are, unrelated, to, planets, the, term, originates, from, the, planet, like, round, shape, of, these, nebulae, observed, by, astronomers, through, early, telescopes, the, first, usage, may, have, occurred, during, the, 1780s, with, the, english, astronomer, william, herschel, who, described, these, nebulae, as, resembling, planets, however, as, early, as, january, 1779, the, french, astronomer, antoine, darquier, de, pellepoix, described, in, his, observations, of, the, ring, nebula, very, dim, but, perfectly, outlined, it, is, as, large, as, jupiter, and, resembles, a, fading, planet, though, the, modern, interpretation, is, different, the, old, term, is, still, used, all, planetary, nebulae, form, at, the, end, of, the, life, of, a, star, of, intermediate, mass, about, 1, 8, solar, masses, it, is, expected, that, the, sun, will, form, a, planetary, nebula, at, the, end, of, its, life, cycle, they, are, relatively, short, lived, phenomena, lasting, perhaps, a, few, tens, of, millennia, compared, to, considerably, longer, phases, of, stellar, evolution, once, all, of, the, red, giant, s, atmosphere, has, been, dissipated, energetic, ultraviolet, radiation, from, the, exposed, hot, luminous, core, called, a, planetary, nebula, nucleus, p, n, n, ionizes, the, ejected, material, absorbed, ultraviolet, light, then, energizes, the, shell, of, nebulous, gas, around, the, central, star, causing, it, to, appear, as, a, brightly, coloured, planetary, nebula, planetary, nebulae, probably, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, chemical, evolution, of, the, milky, way, by, expelling, elements, into, the, interstellar, medium, from, stars, where, those, elements, were, created, planetary, nebulae, are, observed, in, more, distant, galaxies, yielding, useful, information, about, their, chemical, abundances, starting, from, the, 1990s, hubble, space, telescope, images, revealed, that, many, planetary, nebulae, have, extremely, complex, and, varied, morphologies, about, one, fifth, are, roughly, spherical, but, the, majority, are, not, spherically, symmetric, the, mechanisms, that, produce, such, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, and, features, are, not, yet, well, understood, but, binary, central, stars, stellar, winds, and, magnetic, fields, may, play, a, role, the, first, planetary, nebula, discovered, though, not, yet, termed, as, such, was, the, dumbbell, nebula, in, the, constellation, of, vulpecula, it, was, observed, by, charles, messier, on, july, 12, 1764, and, listed, as, m27, in, his, catalogue, of, nebulous, objects, to, early, observers, with, low, resolution, telescopes, m27, and, subsequently, discovered, planetary, nebulae, resembled, the, giant, planets, like, uranus, as, early, as, january, 1779, the, french, astronomer, antoine, darquier, de, pellepoix, described, in, his, observations, of, the, ring, nebula, a, very, dull, nebula, but, perfectly, outlined, as, large, as, jupiter, and, looks, like, a, fading, planet, the, nature, of, these, objects, remained, unclear, in, 1782, william, herschel, discoverer, of, uranus, found, the, saturn, nebula, ngc, 7009, and, described, it, as, a, curious, nebula, or, what, else, to, call, it, i, do, not, know, he, later, described, these, objects, as, seeming, to, be, planets, of, the, starry, kind, as, noted, by, darquier, before, him, herschel, found, that, the, disk, resembled, a, planet, but, it, was, too, faint, to, be, one, in, 1785, herschel, wrote, to, j, r, me, lalande, these, are, celestial, bodies, of, which, as, yet, we, have, no, clear, idea, and, which, are, perhaps, of, a, type, quite, different, from, those, that, we, are, familiar, with, in, the, heavens, i, have, already, found, four, that, have, a, visible, diameter, of, between, 15, and, 30, seconds, these, bodies, appear, to, have, a, disk, that, is, rather, like, a, planet, that, is, to, say, of, equal, brightness, all, over, round, or, somewhat, oval, and, about, as, well, defined, in, outline, as, the, disk, of, the, planets, of, a, light, strong, enough, to, be, visible, with, an, ordinary, telescope, of, only, one, foot, yet, they, have, only, the, appearance, of, a, star, of, about, ninth, magnitude, he, assigned, these, to, class, iv, of, his, catalogue, of, nebulae, eventually, listing, 78, planetary, nebulae, most, of, which, are, in, fact, galaxies, herschel, used, the, term, planetary, nebulae, for, these, objects, the, origin, of, this, term, not, known, the, label, planetary, nebula, became, ingrained, in, the, terminology, used, by, astronomers, to, categorize, these, types, of, nebulae, and, is, still, in, use, by, astronomers, today, the, nature, of, planetary, nebulae, remained, unknown, until, the, first, spectroscopic, observations, were, made, in, the, mid, 19th, century, using, a, prism, to, disperse, their, light, william, huggins, was, one, of, the, earliest, astronomers, to, study, the, optical, spectra, of, astronomical, objects, on, august, 29, 1864, huggins, was, the, first, to, analyze, the, spectrum, of, a, planetary, nebula, when, he, observed, cat, s, eye, nebula, his, observations, of, stars, had, shown, that, their, spectra, consisted, of, a, continuum, of, radiation, with, many, dark, lines, superimposed, he, found, that, many, nebulous, objects, such, as, the, andromeda, nebula, as, it, was, then, known, had, spectra, that, were, quite, similar, however, when, huggins, looked, at, the, cat, s, eye, nebula, he, found, a, very, different, spectrum, rather, than, a, strong, continuum, with, absorption, lines, superimposed, the, cat, s, eye, nebula, and, other, similar, objects, showed, a, number, of, emission, lines, brightest, of, these, was, at, a, wavelength, of, 500, 7, nanometres, which, did, not, correspond, with, a, line, of, any, known, element, at, first, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, line, might, be, due, to, an, unknown, element, which, was, named, nebulium, a, similar, idea, had, led, to, the, discovery, of, helium, through, analysis, of, the, sun, s, spectrum, in, 1868, while, helium, was, isolated, on, earth, soon, after, its, discovery, in, the, spectrum, of, the, sun, nebulium, was, not, in, the, early, 20th, century, henry, norris, russell, proposed, that, rather, than, being, a, new, element, the, line, at, 500, 7, nm, was, due, to, a, familiar, element, in, unfamiliar, conditions, physicists, showed, in, the, 1920s, that, in, gas, at, extremely, low, densities, electrons, can, occupy, excited, metastable, energy, levels, in, atoms, and, ions, that, would, otherwise, be, de, excited, by, collisions, that, would, occur, at, higher, densities, electron, transitions, from, these, levels, in, nitrogen, and, oxygen, ions, o, o, 2, a, k, a, o, iii, and, n, give, rise, to, the, 500, 7, nm, emission, line, and, others, these, spectral, lines, which, can, only, be, seen, in, very, low, density, gases, are, called, forbidden, lines, spectroscopic, observations, thus, showed, that, nebulae, were, made, of, extremely, rarefied, gas, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, are, very, hot, only, when, a, star, has, exhausted, most, of, its, nuclear, fuel, can, it, collapse, to, a, small, size, planetary, nebulae, are, understood, as, a, final, stage, of, stellar, evolution, spectroscopic, observations, show, that, all, planetary, nebulae, are, expanding, this, led, to, the, idea, that, planetary, nebulae, were, caused, by, a, star, s, outer, layers, being, thrown, into, space, at, the, end, of, its, life, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, technological, improvements, helped, to, further, the, study, of, planetary, nebulae, space, telescopes, allowed, astronomers, to, study, light, wavelengths, outside, those, that, the, earth, s, atmosphere, transmits, infrared, and, ultraviolet, studies, of, planetary, nebulae, allowed, much, more, accurate, determinations, of, nebular, temperatures, densities, and, elemental, abundances, charge, coupled, device, technology, allowed, much, fainter, spectral, lines, to, be, measured, accurately, than, had, previously, been, possible, the, hubble, space, telescope, also, showed, that, while, many, nebulae, appear, to, have, simple, and, regular, structures, when, observed, from, the, ground, the, very, high, optical, resolution, achievable, by, telescopes, above, the, earth, s, atmosphere, reveals, extremely, complex, structures, under, the, morgan, keenan, spectral, classification, scheme, planetary, nebulae, are, classified, as, type, p, although, this, notation, is, seldom, used, in, practice, stars, greater, than, 8, solar, masses, m, will, probably, end, their, lives, in, dramatic, supernovae, explosions, while, planetary, nebulae, seemingly, only, occur, at, the, end, of, the, lives, of, intermediate, and, low, mass, stars, between, 0, 8, m, to, 8, 0, m, progenitor, stars, that, form, planetary, nebulae, will, spend, most, of, their, lifetimes, converting, their, hydrogen, into, helium, in, the, star, s, core, by, nuclear, fusion, at, about, 15, million, k, this, generates, energy, in, the, core, which, creates, outward, pressure, that, balances, the, crushing, inward, pressures, of, gravity, this, state, of, equilibrium, is, known, as, the, main, sequence, which, can, last, for, tens, of, millions, to, billions, of, years, depending, on, the, mass, when, the, hydrogen, in, the, core, starts, to, run, out, nuclear, fusion, generates, less, energy, and, gravity, starts, compressing, the, core, causing, a, rise, in, temperature, to, about, 100, million, k, such, high, core, temperatures, then, make, the, star, s, cooler, outer, layers, expand, to, create, much, larger, red, giant, stars, this, end, phase, causes, a, dramatic, rise, in, stellar, luminosity, where, the, released, energy, is, distributed, over, a, much, larger, surface, area, which, in, fact, causes, the, average, surface, temperature, to, be, lower, in, stellar, evolution, terms, stars, undergoing, such, increases, in, luminosity, are, known, as, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, agb, during, this, phase, the, star, can, lose, 50, 70, of, its, total, mass, from, its, stellar, wind, for, the, more, massive, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, that, form, planetary, nebulae, whose, progenitors, exceed, about, 0, 6m, their, cores, will, continue, to, contract, when, temperatures, reach, about, 100, million, k, the, available, helium, nuclei, fuse, into, carbon, and, oxygen, so, that, the, star, again, resumes, radiating, energy, temporarily, stopping, the, core, s, contraction, this, new, helium, burning, phase, fusion, of, helium, nuclei, forms, a, growing, inner, core, of, inert, carbon, and, oxygen, above, it, is, a, thin, helium, burning, shell, surrounded, in, turn, by, a, hydrogen, burning, shell, however, this, new, phase, lasts, only, 20, 000, years, or, so, a, very, short, period, compared, to, the, entire, lifetime, of, the, star, the, venting, of, atmosphere, continues, unabated, into, interstellar, space, but, when, the, outer, surface, of, the, exposed, core, reaches, temperatures, exceeding, about, 30, 000, k, there, are, enough, emitted, ultraviolet, photons, to, ionize, the, ejected, atmosphere, causing, the, gas, to, shine, as, a, planetary, nebula, after, a, star, passes, through, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, agb, phase, the, short, planetary, nebula, phase, of, stellar, evolution, begins, as, gases, blow, away, from, the, central, star, at, speeds, of, a, few, kilometers, per, second, the, central, star, is, the, remnant, of, its, agb, progenitor, an, electron, degenerate, carbon, oxygen, core, that, has, lost, most, of, its, hydrogen, envelope, due, to, mass, loss, on, the, agb, as, the, gases, expand, the, central, star, undergoes, a, two, stage, evolution, first, growing, hotter, as, it, continues, to, contract, and, hydrogen, fusion, reactions, occur, in, the, shell, around, the, core, and, then, slowly, cooling, when, the, hydrogen, shell, is, exhausted, through, fusion, and, mass, loss, in, the, second, phase, it, radiates, away, its, energy, and, fusion, reactions, cease, as, the, central, star, is, not, heavy, enough, to, generate, the, core, temperatures, required, for, carbon, and, oxygen, to, fuse, during, the, first, phase, the, central, star, maintains, constant, luminosity, while, at, the, same, time, it, grows, ever, hotter, eventually, reaching, temperatures, around, 100, 000, k, in, the, second, phase, it, cools, so, much, that, it, does, not, give, off, enough, ultraviolet, radiation, to, ionize, the, increasingly, distant, gas, cloud, the, star, becomes, a, white, dwarf, and, the, expanding, gas, cloud, becomes, invisible, to, us, ending, the, planetary, nebula, phase, of, evolution, for, a, typical, planetary, nebula, about, 10, 000, years, passes, between, its, formation, and, recombination, of, the, resulting, plasma, planetary, nebulae, may, play, a, very, important, role, in, galactic, evolution, newly, born, stars, consist, almost, entirely, of, hydrogen, and, helium, but, as, stars, evolve, through, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, phase, they, create, heavier, elements, via, nuclear, fusion, which, are, eventually, expelled, by, strong, stellar, winds, planetary, nebulae, usually, contain, larger, proportions, of, elements, such, as, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, and, these, are, recycled, into, the, interstellar, medium, via, these, powerful, winds, in, this, way, planetary, nebulae, greatly, enrich, the, milky, way, and, their, nebulae, with, these, heavier, elements, collectively, known, by, astronomers, as, metals, and, specifically, referred, to, by, the, metallicity, parameter, z, subsequent, generations, of, stars, formed, from, such, nebulae, also, tend, to, have, higher, metallicities, although, these, metals, are, present, in, stars, in, relatively, tiny, amounts, they, have, marked, effects, on, stellar, evolution, and, fusion, reactions, when, stars, formed, earlier, in, the, universe, they, theoretically, contained, smaller, quantities, of, heavier, elements, known, examples, are, the, metal, poor, population, ii, stars, see, stellar, population, identification, of, stellar, metallicity, content, is, found, by, spectroscopy, a, typical, planetary, nebula, is, roughly, one, light, year, across, and, consists, of, extremely, rarefied, gas, with, a, density, generally, from, 100, to, 10, 000, particles, per, cm, 3, the, earth, s, atmosphere, by, comparison, contains, 2, 5, 10, 19, particles, per, cm, 3, young, planetary, nebulae, have, the, highest, densities, sometimes, as, high, as, 10, 6, particles, per, cm, 3, as, nebulae, age, their, expansion, causes, their, density, to, decrease, the, masses, of, planetary, nebulae, range, from, 0, 1, to, 1, solar, masses, radiation, from, the, central, star, heats, the, gases, to, temperatures, of, about, 10, 000, k, the, gas, temperature, in, central, regions, is, usually, much, higher, than, at, the, periphery, reaching, 16, 000, 25, 000, k, the, volume, in, the, vicinity, of, the, central, star, is, often, filled, with, a, very, hot, coronal, gas, having, the, temperature, of, about, 1, 000, 000, k, this, gas, originates, from, the, surface, of, the, central, star, in, the, form, of, the, fast, stellar, wind, nebulae, may, be, described, as, matter, bounded, or, radiation, bounded, in, the, former, case, there, is, not, enough, matter, in, the, nebula, to, absorb, all, the, uv, photons, emitted, by, the, star, and, the, visible, nebula, is, fully, ionized, in, the, latter, case, there, are, not, enough, uv, photons, being, emitted, by, the, central, star, to, ionize, all, the, surrounding, gas, and, an, ionization, front, propagates, outward, into, the, circumstellar, envelope, of, neutral, atoms, about, 3000, planetary, nebulae, are, now, known, to, exist, in, our, galaxy, out, of, 200, billion, stars, their, very, short, lifetime, compared, to, total, stellar, lifetime, accounts, for, their, rarity, they, are, found, mostly, near, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, with, the, greatest, concentration, near, the, galactic, center, only, about, 20, of, planetary, nebulae, are, spherically, symmetric, for, example, see, abell, 39, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, exist, with, some, very, complex, forms, seen, planetary, nebulae, are, classified, by, different, authors, into, stellar, disk, ring, irregular, helical, bipolar, quadrupolar, and, other, types, although, the, majority, of, them, belong, to, just, three, types, spherical, elliptical, and, bipolar, bipolar, nebulae, are, concentrated, in, the, galactic, plane, probably, produced, by, relatively, young, massive, progenitor, stars, and, bipolars, in, the, galactic, bulge, appear, to, prefer, orienting, their, orbital, axes, parallel, to, the, galactic, plane, on, the, other, hand, spherical, nebulae, are, probably, produced, by, old, stars, similar, to, the, sun, the, huge, variety, of, the, shapes, is, partially, the, projection, effect, the, same, nebula, when, viewed, under, different, angles, will, appear, different, nevertheless, the, reason, for, the, huge, variety, of, physical, shapes, is, not, fully, understood, gravitational, interactions, with, companion, stars, if, the, central, stars, are, binary, stars, may, be, one, cause, another, possibility, is, that, planets, disrupt, the, flow, of, material, away, from, the, star, as, the, nebula, forms, it, has, been, determined, that, the, more, massive, stars, produce, more, irregularly, shaped, nebulae, in, january, 2005, astronomers, announced, the, first, detection, of, magnetic, fields, around, the, central, stars, of, two, planetary, nebulae, and, hypothesized, that, the, fields, might, be, partly, or, wholly, responsible, for, their, remarkable, shapes, planetary, nebulae, have, been, detected, as, members, in, four, galactic, globular, clusters, messier, 15, messier, 22, ngc, 6441, and, palomar, 6, evidence, also, points, to, the, potential, discovery, of, planetary, nebulae, in, globular, clusters, in, the, galaxy, m31, however, there, is, currently, only, one, case, of, a, planetary, nebula, discovered, in, an, open, cluster, that, is, agreed, upon, by, independent, researchers, that, case, pertains, to, the, planetary, nebula, phr, 1315, 6555, and, the, open, cluster, andrews, lindsay, 1, indeed, through, cluster, membership, phr, 1315, 6555, possesses, among, the, most, precise, distances, established, for, a, planetary, nebula, i, e, a, 4, distance, solution, the, cases, of, ngc, 2818, and, ngc, 2348, in, messier, 46, exhibit, mismatched, velocities, between, the, planetary, nebulae, and, the, clusters, which, indicates, they, are, line, of, sight, coincidences, a, subsample, of, tentative, cases, that, may, potentially, be, cluster, pn, pairs, includes, abell, 8, and, bica, 6, and, he, 2, 86, and, ngc, 4463, theoretical, models, predict, that, planetary, nebulae, can, form, from, main, sequence, stars, of, between, one, and, eight, solar, masses, which, puts, the, progenitor, star, s, age, at, greater, than, 40, million, years, although, there, are, a, few, hundred, known, open, clusters, within, that, age, range, a, variety, of, reasons, limit, the, chances, of, finding, a, planetary, nebula, within, for, one, reason, the, planetary, nebula, phase, for, more, massive, stars, is, on, the, order, of, millennia, which, is, a, blink, of, the, eye, in, astronomic, terms, also, partly, because, of, their, small, total, mass, open, clusters, have, relatively, poor, gravitational, cohesion, and, tend, to, disperse, after, a, relatively, short, time, typically, from, 100, to, 600, million, years, the, distances, to, planetary, nebulae, are, generally, poorly, determined, but, the, gaia, mission, is, now, measuring, direct, parallactic, distances, between, their, central, stars, and, neighboring, stars, it, is, also, possible, to, determine, distances, to, nearby, planetary, nebula, by, measuring, their, expansion, rates, high, resolution, observations, taken, several, years, apart, will, show, the, expansion, of, the, nebula, perpendicular, to, the, line, of, sight, while, spectroscopic, observations, of, the, doppler, shift, will, reveal, the, velocity, of, expansion, in, the, line, of, sight, comparing, the, angular, expansion, with, the, derived, velocity, of, expansion, will, reveal, the, distance, to, the, nebula, the, issue, of, how, such, a, diverse, range, of, nebular, shapes, can, be, produced, is, a, debatable, topic, it, is, theorised, that, interactions, between, material, moving, away, from, the, star, at, different, speeds, gives, rise, to, most, observed, shapes, however, some, astronomers, postulate, that, close, binary, central, stars, might, be, responsible, for, the, more, complex, and, extreme, planetary, nebulae, several, have, been, shown, to, exhibit, strong, magnetic, fields, and, their, interactions, with, ionized, gas, could, explain, some, planetary, nebulae, shapes, there, are, two, main, methods, of, determining, metal, abundances, in, nebulae, these, rely, on, recombination, lines, and, collisionally, excited, lines, large, discrepancies, are, sometimes, seen, between, the, results, derived, from, the, two, methods, this, may, be, explained, by, the, presence, of, small, temperature, fluctuations, within, planetary, nebulae, the, discrepancies, may, be, too, large, to, be, caused, by, temperature, effects, and, some, hypothesize, the, existence, of, cold, knots, containing, very, little, hydrogen, to, explain, the, observations, however, such, knots, have, yet, to, be, observed
