alpha, particles, also, called, alpha, rays, or, alpha, radiation, consist, of, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, bound, together, into, a, particle, identical, to, a, helium, 4, nucleus, they, are, generally, produced, in, the, process, of, alpha, decay, but, may, also, be, produced, in, other, ways, alpha, particles, are, named, after, the, first, letter, in, the, greek, alphabet, the, symbol, for, the, alpha, particle, is, or, 2, because, they, are, identical, to, helium, nuclei, they, are, also, sometimes, written, as, he, 2, or, 4, 2, he, 2, indicating, a, helium, ion, with, a, 2, charge, missing, its, two, electrons, once, the, ion, gains, electrons, from, its, environment, the, alpha, particle, becomes, a, normal, electrically, neutral, helium, atom, 4, 2, he, alpha, particles, have, a, net, spin, of, zero, when, produced, in, standard, alpha, radioactive, decay, alpha, particles, generally, have, a, kinetic, energy, of, about, 5, mev, and, a, velocity, in, the, vicinity, of, 4, of, the, speed, of, light, they, are, a, highly, ionizing, form, of, particle, radiation, with, low, penetration, depth, stopped, by, a, few, centimetres, of, air, or, by, the, skin, however, so, called, long, range, alpha, particles, from, ternary, fission, are, three, times, as, energetic, and, penetrate, three, times, as, far, the, helium, nuclei, that, form, 10, 12, of, cosmic, rays, are, also, usually, of, much, higher, energy, than, those, produced, by, nuclear, decay, processes, and, thus, may, be, highly, penetrating, and, able, to, traverse, the, human, body, and, also, many, metres, of, dense, solid, shielding, depending, on, their, energy, to, a, lesser, extent, this, is, also, true, of, very, high, energy, helium, nuclei, produced, by, particle, accelerators, the, term, alpha, particle, was, coined, by, ernest, rutherford, in, reporting, his, studies, of, the, properties, of, uranium, radiation, the, radiation, appeared, to, have, two, different, characters, the, first, he, called, displaystyle, alpha, radiation, and, the, more, penetrating, one, he, called, displaystyle, beta, radiation, after, five, years, of, additional, experimental, work, rutherford, and, hans, geiger, determined, that, the, alpha, particle, after, it, has, lost, its, positive, charge, is, a, helium, atom, 61, alpha, radiation, consists, of, particles, equivalent, to, doubly, ionized, helium, nuclei, he, 2, which, can, gain, electrons, from, passing, through, matter, this, mechanism, is, the, origin, of, terrestrial, helium, gas, the, best, known, source, of, alpha, particles, is, alpha, decay, of, heavier, mass, number, of, at, least, 104, atoms, when, an, atom, emits, an, alpha, particle, in, alpha, decay, the, atom, s, mass, number, decreases, by, four, due, to, the, loss, of, the, four, nucleons, in, the, alpha, particle, the, atomic, number, of, the, atom, goes, down, by, two, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, two, protons, the, atom, becomes, a, new, element, examples, of, this, sort, of, nuclear, transmutation, by, alpha, decay, are, the, decay, of, uranium, to, thorium, and, that, of, radium, to, radon, alpha, particles, are, commonly, emitted, by, all, of, the, larger, radioactive, nuclei, such, as, uranium, thorium, actinium, and, radium, as, well, as, the, transuranic, elements, unlike, other, types, of, decay, alpha, decay, as, a, process, must, have, a, minimum, size, atomic, nucleus, that, can, support, it, the, smallest, nuclei, that, have, to, date, been, found, to, be, capable, of, alpha, emission, are, beryllium, 8, and, tellurium, 104, not, counting, beta, delayed, alpha, emission, of, some, lighter, elements, the, alpha, decay, sometimes, leaves, the, parent, nucleus, in, an, excited, state, the, emission, of, a, gamma, ray, then, removes, the, excess, energy, in, contrast, to, beta, decay, the, fundamental, interactions, responsible, for, alpha, decay, are, a, balance, between, the, electromagnetic, force, and, nuclear, force, alpha, decay, results, from, the, coulomb, repulsion, between, the, alpha, particle, and, the, rest, of, the, nucleus, which, both, have, a, positive, electric, charge, but, which, is, kept, in, check, by, the, nuclear, force, in, classical, physics, alpha, particles, do, not, have, enough, energy, to, escape, the, potential, well, from, the, strong, force, inside, the, nucleus, this, well, involves, escaping, the, strong, force, to, go, up, one, side, of, the, well, which, is, followed, by, the, electromagnetic, force, causing, a, repulsive, push, off, down, the, other, side, however, the, quantum, tunnelling, effect, allows, alphas, to, escape, even, though, they, do, not, have, enough, energy, to, overcome, the, nuclear, force, this, is, allowed, by, the, wave, nature, of, matter, which, allows, the, alpha, particle, to, spend, some, of, its, time, in, a, region, so, far, from, the, nucleus, that, the, potential, from, the, repulsive, electromagnetic, force, has, fully, compensated, for, the, attraction, of, the, nuclear, force, from, this, point, alpha, particles, can, escape, especially, energetic, alpha, particles, deriving, from, a, nuclear, process, are, produced, in, the, relatively, rare, one, in, a, few, hundred, nuclear, fission, process, of, ternary, fission, in, this, process, three, charged, particles, are, produced, from, the, event, instead, of, the, normal, two, with, the, smallest, of, the, charged, particles, most, probably, 90, probability, being, an, alpha, particle, such, alpha, particles, are, termed, long, range, alphas, since, at, their, typical, energy, of, 16, mev, they, are, at, far, higher, energy, than, is, ever, produced, by, alpha, decay, ternary, fission, happens, in, both, neutron, induced, fission, the, nuclear, reaction, that, happens, in, a, nuclear, reactor, and, also, when, fissionable, and, fissile, actinides, nuclides, i, e, heavy, atoms, capable, of, fission, undergo, spontaneous, fission, as, a, form, of, radioactive, decay, in, both, induced, and, spontaneous, fission, the, higher, energies, available, in, heavy, nuclei, result, in, long, range, alphas, of, higher, energy, than, those, from, alpha, decay, energetic, helium, nuclei, helium, ions, may, be, produced, by, cyclotrons, synchrotrons, and, other, particle, accelerators, convention, is, that, they, are, not, normally, referred, to, as, alpha, particles, helium, nuclei, may, participate, in, nuclear, reactions, in, stars, and, occasionally, and, historically, these, have, been, referred, to, as, alpha, reactions, see, triple, alpha, process, and, alpha, process, in, addition, extremely, high, energy, helium, nuclei, sometimes, referred, to, as, alpha, particles, make, up, about, 10, to, 12, of, cosmic, rays, the, mechanisms, of, cosmic, ray, production, continue, to, be, debated, the, energy, of, the, alpha, particle, emitted, in, alpha, decay, is, mildly, dependent, on, the, half, life, for, the, emission, process, with, many, orders, of, magnitude, differences, in, half, life, being, associated, with, energy, changes, of, less, than, 50, shown, by, the, geiger, nuttall, law, the, energy, of, alpha, particles, emitted, varies, with, higher, energy, alpha, particles, being, emitted, from, larger, nuclei, but, most, alpha, particles, have, energies, of, between, 3, and, 7, mev, mega, electron, volts, corresponding, to, extremely, long, and, extremely, short, half, lives, of, alpha, emitting, nuclides, respectively, the, energies, and, ratios, are, often, distinct, and, can, be, used, to, identify, specific, nuclides, as, in, alpha, spectrometry, with, a, typical, kinetic, energy, of, 5, mev, the, speed, of, emitted, alpha, particles, is, 15, 000, km, s, which, is, 5, of, the, speed, of, light, this, energy, is, a, substantial, amount, of, energy, for, a, single, particle, but, their, high, mass, means, alpha, particles, have, a, lower, speed, than, any, other, common, type, of, radiation, e, g, particles, neutrons, because, of, their, charge, and, large, mass, alpha, particles, are, easily, absorbed, by, materials, and, they, can, travel, only, a, few, centimetres, in, air, they, can, be, absorbed, by, tissue, paper, or, by, the, outer, layers, of, human, skin, they, typically, penetrate, skin, about, 40, micrometres, equivalent, to, a, few, cells, deep, due, to, the, short, range, of, absorption, and, inability, to, penetrate, the, outer, layers, of, skin, alpha, particles, are, not, in, general, dangerous, to, life, unless, the, source, is, ingested, or, inhaled, because, of, this, high, mass, and, strong, absorption, if, alpha, emitting, radionuclides, do, enter, the, body, upon, being, inhaled, ingested, or, injected, as, with, the, use, of, thorotrast, for, high, quality, x, ray, images, prior, to, the, 1950s, alpha, radiation, is, the, most, destructive, form, of, ionizing, radiation, it, is, the, most, strongly, ionizing, and, with, large, enough, doses, can, cause, any, or, all, of, the, symptoms, of, radiation, poisoning, it, is, estimated, that, chromosome, damage, from, alpha, particles, is, anywhere, from, 10, to, 1000, times, greater, than, that, caused, by, an, equivalent, amount, of, gamma, or, beta, radiation, with, the, average, being, set, at, 20, times, a, study, of, european, nuclear, workers, exposed, internally, to, alpha, radiation, from, plutonium, and, uranium, found, that, when, relative, biological, effectiveness, is, considered, to, be, 20, the, carcinogenic, potential, in, terms, of, lung, cancer, of, alpha, radiation, appears, to, be, consistent, with, that, reported, for, doses, of, external, gamma, radiation, i, e, a, given, dose, of, alpha, particles, inhaled, presents, the, same, risk, as, a, 20, times, higher, dose, of, gamma, radiation, the, powerful, alpha, emitter, polonium, 210, a, milligram, of, 210, po, emits, as, many, alpha, particles, per, second, as, 4, 215, grams, of, 226, ra, is, suspected, of, playing, a, role, in, lung, cancer, and, bladder, cancer, related, to, tobacco, smoking, 210, po, was, used, to, kill, russian, dissident, and, ex, fsb, officer, alexander, v, litvinenko, in, 2006, in, 1899, physicists, ernest, rutherford, working, in, mcgill, university, in, montreal, canada, and, paul, villard, working, in, paris, separated, radiation, into, three, types, eventually, named, alpha, beta, and, gamma, by, rutherford, based, on, penetration, of, objects, and, deflection, by, a, magnetic, field, alpha, rays, were, defined, by, rutherford, as, those, having, the, lowest, penetration, of, ordinary, objects, rutherford, s, work, also, included, measurements, of, the, ratio, of, an, alpha, particle, s, mass, to, its, charge, which, led, him, to, the, hypothesis, that, alpha, particles, were, doubly, charged, helium, ions, later, shown, to, be, bare, helium, nuclei, in, 1909, ernest, rutherford, and, thomas, royds, finally, proved, that, alpha, particles, were, indeed, helium, ions, to, do, this, they, collected, and, purified, the, gas, emitted, by, radium, a, known, alpha, particle, emitter, in, a, glass, tube, an, electric, spark, discharge, inside, the, tube, produced, light, subsequent, study, of, the, spectra, of, this, light, showed, that, the, gas, was, helium, and, thus, the, alpha, particles, were, indeed, the, helium, ions, 61, because, alpha, particles, occur, naturally, but, can, have, energy, high, enough, to, participate, in, a, nuclear, reaction, study, of, them, led, to, much, early, knowledge, of, nuclear, physics, rutherford, used, alpha, particles, emitted, by, radium, bromide, to, infer, that, j, j, thomson, s, plum, pudding, model, of, the, atom, was, fundamentally, flawed, in, rutherford, s, gold, foil, experiment, conducted, by, his, students, hans, geiger, and, ernest, marsden, a, narrow, beam, of, alpha, particles, was, established, passing, through, very, thin, a, few, hundred, atoms, thick, gold, foil, the, alpha, particles, were, detected, by, a, zinc, sulfide, screen, which, emits, a, flash, of, light, upon, an, alpha, particle, collision, rutherford, hypothesized, that, assuming, the, plum, pudding, model, of, the, atom, was, correct, the, positively, charged, alpha, particles, would, be, only, slightly, deflected, if, at, all, by, the, dispersed, positive, charge, predicted, it, was, found, that, some, of, the, alpha, particles, were, deflected, at, much, larger, angles, than, expected, at, a, suggestion, by, rutherford, to, check, it, and, some, even, bounced, almost, directly, back, although, most, of, the, alpha, particles, went, straight, through, as, expected, rutherford, commented, that, the, few, particles, that, were, deflected, was, akin, to, shooting, a, fifteen, inch, shell, at, tissue, paper, only, to, have, it, bounce, off, again, assuming, the, plum, pudding, theory, was, correct, it, was, determined, that, the, atom, s, positive, charge, was, concentrated, in, a, small, area, in, its, center, making, the, positive, charge, dense, enough, to, deflect, any, positively, charged, alpha, particles, that, came, close, to, what, was, later, termed, the, nucleus, prior, to, this, discovery, it, was, not, known, that, alpha, particles, were, themselves, atomic, nuclei, nor, was, the, existence, of, protons, or, neutrons, known, after, this, discovery, j, j, thomson, s, plum, pudding, model, was, abandoned, and, rutherford, s, experiment, led, to, the, bohr, model, and, later, the, modern, wave, mechanical, model, of, the, atom, in, 1917, rutherford, went, on, to, use, alpha, particles, to, accidentally, produce, what, he, later, understood, as, a, directed, nuclear, transmutation, of, one, element, to, another, transmutation, of, elements, from, one, to, another, had, been, understood, since, 1901, as, a, result, of, natural, radioactive, decay, but, when, rutherford, projected, alpha, particles, from, alpha, decay, into, air, he, discovered, this, produced, a, new, type, of, radiation, which, proved, to, be, hydrogen, nuclei, rutherford, named, these, protons, further, experimentation, showed, the, protons, to, be, coming, from, the, nitrogen, component, of, air, and, the, reaction, was, deduced, to, be, a, transmutation, of, nitrogen, into, oxygen, in, the, reaction, this, was, the, first, discovered, nuclear, reaction, to, the, adjacent, pictures, according, to, the, energy, loss, curve, by, bragg, it, is, recognizable, that, the, alpha, particle, indeed, loses, more, energy, on, the, end, of, the, trace, in, 2011, members, of, the, international, star, collaboration, using, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, at, the, u, s, department, of, energy, s, brookhaven, national, laboratory, detected, the, antimatter, partner, of, the, helium, nucleus, also, known, as, the, anti, alpha, the, experiment, used, gold, ions, moving, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, and, colliding, head, on, to, produce, the, antiparticle, alpha, emitting, radionuclides, are, presently, being, used, in, three, different, ways, to, eradicate, cancerous, tumors, as, an, infusible, radioactive, treatment, targeted, to, specific, tissues, radium, 223, as, a, source, of, radiation, inserted, directly, into, solid, tumors, radium, 224, and, as, an, attachment, to, an, tumor, targeting, molecule, such, as, an, antibody, to, a, tumor, associated, antigen, radium, 223, is, an, alpha, emitter, that, is, naturally, attracted, to, the, bone, because, it, is, a, calcium, mimetic, radium, 223, as, radium, 223, dichloride, can, be, infused, into, a, cancer, patient, s, veins, after, which, it, migrates, to, parts, of, the, bone, where, there, is, rapid, turnover, of, cells, due, to, the, presence, of, metastasized, tumors, once, within, the, bone, ra, 223, emits, alpha, radiation, that, can, destroy, tumor, cells, within, a, 100, micron, distance, this, approach, has, been, in, use, since, 2013, to, treat, prostate, cancer, which, has, metastasized, to, the, bone, radionuclides, infused, into, the, circulation, are, able, to, reach, sites, that, are, accessible, to, blood, vessels, this, means, however, that, the, interior, of, a, large, tumor, that, is, not, vascularized, i, e, is, not, well, penetrated, by, blood, vessels, may, not, be, effectively, eradicated, by, the, radioactivity, radium, 224, is, a, radioactive, atom, that, is, utilized, as, a, source, of, alpha, radiation, in, a, cancer, treatment, device, called, dart, diffusing, alpha, emitters, radiation, therapy, each, radium, 224, atom, undergoes, a, decay, process, producing, 6, daughter, atoms, during, this, process, 4, alpha, particles, are, emitted, the, range, of, an, alpha, particle, up, to, 100, microns, is, insufficient, to, cover, the, width, of, many, tumors, however, radium, 224, s, daughter, atoms, can, diffuse, up, to, 2, 3, mm, in, the, tissue, thus, creating, a, kill, region, with, enough, radiation, to, potentially, destroy, an, entire, tumor, if, the, seeds, are, placed, appropriately, radium, 224, s, half, life, is, short, enough, at, 3, 6, days, to, produce, a, rapid, clinical, effect, while, avoiding, the, risk, of, radiation, damage, due, to, overexposure, at, the, same, time, the, half, life, is, long, enough, to, allow, for, handling, and, shipping, the, seeds, to, a, cancer, treatment, center, at, any, location, across, the, globe, targeted, alpha, therapy, for, solid, tumors, involves, attaching, an, alpha, particle, emitting, radionuclide, to, a, tumor, targeting, molecule, such, as, an, antibody, that, can, be, delivered, by, intravenous, administration, to, a, cancer, patient, in, computer, technology, dynamic, random, access, memory, dram, soft, errors, were, linked, to, alpha, particles, in, 1978, in, intel, s, dram, chips, the, discovery, led, to, strict, control, of, radioactive, elements, in, the, packaging, of, semiconductor, materials, and, the, problem, is, largely, considered, to, be, solved, media, related, to, alpha, particles, at, wikimedia, commons
