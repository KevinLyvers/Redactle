an, intermolecular, force, imf, also, secondary, force, is, the, force, that, mediates, interaction, between, molecules, including, the, electromagnetic, forces, of, attraction, or, repulsion, which, act, between, atoms, and, other, types, of, neighbouring, particles, e, g, atoms, or, ions, intermolecular, forces, are, weak, relative, to, intramolecular, forces, the, forces, which, hold, a, molecule, together, for, example, the, covalent, bond, involving, sharing, electron, pairs, between, atoms, is, much, stronger, than, the, forces, present, between, neighboring, molecules, both, sets, of, forces, are, essential, parts, of, force, fields, frequently, used, in, molecular, mechanics, the, first, reference, to, the, nature, of, microscopic, forces, is, found, in, alexis, clairaut, s, work, th, orie, de, la, figure, de, la, terre, published, in, paris, in, 1743, other, scientists, who, have, contributed, to, the, investigation, of, microscopic, forces, include, laplace, gauss, maxwell, boltzmann, and, pauling, attractive, intermolecular, forces, are, categorized, into, the, following, types, information, on, intermolecular, forces, is, obtained, by, macroscopic, measurements, of, properties, like, viscosity, pressure, volume, temperature, pvt, data, the, link, to, microscopic, aspects, is, given, by, virial, coefficients, and, intermolecular, pair, potentials, such, as, the, mie, potential, buckingham, potential, or, lennard, jones, potential, in, the, broadest, sense, it, can, be, understood, as, such, interactions, between, any, particles, molecules, atoms, ions, and, molecular, ions, in, which, the, formation, of, chemical, that, is, ionic, covalent, or, metallic, bonds, does, not, occur, in, other, words, these, interactions, are, significantly, weaker, than, covalent, ones, and, do, not, lead, to, a, significant, restructuring, of, the, electronic, structure, of, the, interacting, particles, this, is, only, partially, true, for, example, all, enzymatic, and, catalytic, reactions, begin, with, a, weak, intermolecular, interaction, between, a, substrate, and, an, enzyme, or, a, molecule, with, a, catalyst, but, several, such, weak, interactions, with, the, required, spatial, configuration, of, the, active, center, of, the, enzyme, lead, to, significant, restructuring, changes, the, energy, state, of, molecules, or, substrate, which, ultimately, leads, to, the, breaking, of, some, and, the, formation, of, other, covalent, chemical, bonds, strictly, speaking, all, enzymatic, reactions, begin, with, intermolecular, interactions, between, the, substrate, and, the, enzyme, therefore, the, importance, of, these, interactions, is, especially, great, in, biochemistry, and, molecular, biology, and, is, the, basis, of, enzymology, a, hydrogen, bond, is, an, extreme, form, of, dipole, dipole, bonding, referring, to, the, attraction, between, a, hydrogen, atom, that, is, bonded, to, an, element, with, high, electronegativity, usually, nitrogen, oxygen, or, fluorine, the, hydrogen, bond, is, often, described, as, a, strong, electrostatic, dipole, dipole, interaction, however, it, also, has, some, features, of, covalent, bonding, it, is, directional, stronger, than, a, van, der, waals, force, interaction, produces, interatomic, distances, shorter, than, the, sum, of, their, van, der, waals, radii, and, usually, involves, a, limited, number, of, interaction, partners, which, can, be, interpreted, as, a, kind, of, valence, the, number, of, hydrogen, bonds, formed, between, molecules, is, equal, to, the, number, of, active, pairs, the, molecule, which, donates, its, hydrogen, is, termed, the, donor, molecule, while, the, molecule, containing, lone, pair, participating, in, h, bonding, is, termed, the, acceptor, molecule, the, number, of, active, pairs, is, equal, to, the, common, number, between, number, of, hydrogens, the, donor, has, and, the, number, of, lone, pairs, the, acceptor, has, though, both, not, depicted, in, the, diagram, water, molecules, have, four, active, bonds, the, oxygen, atom, s, two, lone, pairs, interact, with, a, hydrogen, each, forming, two, additional, hydrogen, bonds, and, the, second, hydrogen, atom, also, interacts, with, a, neighbouring, oxygen, intermolecular, hydrogen, bonding, is, responsible, for, the, high, boiling, point, of, water, 100, c, compared, to, the, other, group, 16, hydrides, which, have, little, capability, to, hydrogen, bond, intramolecular, hydrogen, bonding, is, partly, responsible, for, the, secondary, tertiary, and, quaternary, structures, of, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, it, also, plays, an, important, role, in, the, structure, of, polymers, both, synthetic, and, natural, the, attraction, between, cationic, and, anionic, sites, is, a, noncovalent, or, intermolecular, interaction, which, is, usually, referred, to, as, ion, pairing, or, salt, bridge, it, is, essentially, due, to, electrostatic, forces, although, in, aqueous, medium, the, association, is, driven, by, entropy, and, often, even, endothermic, most, salts, form, crystals, with, characteristic, distances, between, the, ions, in, contrast, to, many, other, noncovalent, interactions, salt, bridges, are, not, directional, and, show, in, the, solid, state, usually, contact, determined, only, by, the, van, der, waals, radii, of, the, ions, inorganic, as, well, as, organic, ions, display, in, water, at, moderate, ionic, strength, i, similar, salt, bridge, as, association, g, values, around, 5, to, 6, kj, mol, for, a, 1, 1, combination, of, anion, and, cation, almost, independent, of, the, nature, size, polarizability, etc, of, the, ions, the, g, values, are, additive, and, approximately, a, linear, function, of, the, charges, the, interaction, of, e, g, a, doubly, charged, phosphate, anion, with, a, single, charged, ammonium, cation, accounts, for, about, 2x5, 10, kj, mol, the, g, values, depend, on, the, ionic, strength, i, of, the, solution, as, described, by, the, debye, h, ckel, equation, at, zero, ionic, strength, one, observes, g, 8, kj, mol, dipole, dipole, interactions, or, keesom, interactions, are, electrostatic, interactions, between, molecules, which, have, permanent, dipoles, this, interaction, is, stronger, than, the, london, forces, but, is, weaker, than, ion, ion, interaction, because, only, partial, charges, are, involved, these, interactions, tend, to, align, the, molecules, to, increase, attraction, reducing, potential, energy, an, example, of, a, dipole, dipole, interaction, can, be, seen, in, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, the, positive, end, of, a, polar, molecule, will, attract, the, negative, end, of, the, other, molecule, and, influence, its, position, polar, molecules, have, a, net, attraction, between, them, examples, of, polar, molecules, include, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, and, chloroform, chcl, 3, often, molecules, contain, dipolar, groups, of, atoms, but, have, no, overall, dipole, moment, on, the, molecule, as, a, whole, this, occurs, if, there, is, symmetry, within, the, molecule, that, causes, the, dipoles, to, cancel, each, other, out, this, occurs, in, molecules, such, as, tetrachloromethane, and, carbon, dioxide, the, dipole, dipole, interaction, between, two, individual, atoms, is, usually, zero, since, atoms, rarely, carry, a, permanent, dipole, the, keesom, interaction, is, a, van, der, waals, force, it, is, discussed, further, in, the, section, van, der, waals, forces, ion, dipole, and, ion, induced, dipole, forces, are, similar, to, dipole, dipole, and, dipole, induced, dipole, interactions, but, involve, ions, instead, of, only, polar, and, non, polar, molecules, ion, dipole, and, ion, induced, dipole, forces, are, stronger, than, dipole, dipole, interactions, because, the, charge, of, any, ion, is, much, greater, than, the, charge, of, a, dipole, moment, ion, dipole, bonding, is, stronger, than, hydrogen, bonding, an, ion, dipole, force, consists, of, an, ion, and, a, polar, molecule, interacting, they, align, so, that, the, positive, and, negative, groups, are, next, to, one, another, allowing, maximum, attraction, an, important, example, of, this, interaction, is, hydration, of, ions, in, water, which, give, rise, to, hydration, enthalpy, the, polar, water, molecules, surround, themselves, around, ions, in, water, and, the, energy, released, during, the, process, is, known, as, hydration, enthalpy, the, interaction, has, its, immense, importance, in, justifying, the, stability, of, various, ions, like, cu, 2, in, water, an, ion, induced, dipole, force, consists, of, an, ion, and, a, non, polar, molecule, interacting, like, a, dipole, induced, dipole, force, the, charge, of, the, ion, causes, distortion, of, the, electron, cloud, on, the, non, polar, molecule, the, van, der, waals, forces, arise, from, interaction, between, uncharged, atoms, or, molecules, leading, not, only, to, such, phenomena, as, the, cohesion, of, condensed, phases, and, physical, absorption, of, gases, but, also, to, a, universal, force, of, attraction, between, macroscopic, bodies, the, first, contribution, to, van, der, waals, forces, is, due, to, electrostatic, interactions, between, rotating, permanent, dipoles, quadrupoles, all, molecules, with, symmetry, lower, than, cubic, and, multipoles, it, is, termed, the, keesom, interaction, named, after, willem, hendrik, keesom, these, forces, originate, from, the, attraction, between, permanent, dipoles, dipolar, molecules, and, are, temperature, dependent, they, consist, of, attractive, interactions, between, dipoles, that, are, ensemble, averaged, over, different, rotational, orientations, of, the, dipoles, it, is, assumed, that, the, molecules, are, constantly, rotating, and, never, get, locked, into, place, this, is, a, good, assumption, but, at, some, point, molecules, do, get, locked, into, place, the, energy, of, a, keesom, interaction, depends, on, the, inverse, sixth, power, of, the, distance, unlike, the, interaction, energy, of, two, spatially, fixed, dipoles, which, depends, on, the, inverse, third, power, of, the, distance, the, keesom, interaction, can, only, occur, among, molecules, that, possess, permanent, dipole, moments, i, e, two, polar, molecules, also, keesom, interactions, are, very, weak, van, der, waals, interactions, and, do, not, occur, in, aqueous, solutions, that, contain, electrolytes, the, angle, averaged, interaction, is, given, by, the, following, equation, where, d, electric, dipole, moment, 0, displaystyle, varepsilon, 0, permittivity, of, free, space, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, dielectric, constant, of, surrounding, material, t, temperature, k, b, displaystyle, k, text, b, boltzmann, constant, and, r, distance, between, molecules, the, second, contribution, is, the, induction, also, termed, polarization, or, debye, force, arising, from, interactions, between, rotating, permanent, dipoles, and, from, the, polarizability, of, atoms, and, molecules, induced, dipoles, these, induced, dipoles, occur, when, one, molecule, with, a, permanent, dipole, repels, another, molecule, s, electrons, a, molecule, with, permanent, dipole, can, induce, a, dipole, in, a, similar, neighboring, molecule, and, cause, mutual, attraction, debye, forces, cannot, occur, between, atoms, the, forces, between, induced, and, permanent, dipoles, are, not, as, temperature, dependent, as, keesom, interactions, because, the, induced, dipole, is, free, to, shift, and, rotate, around, the, polar, molecule, the, debye, induction, effects, and, keesom, orientation, effects, are, termed, polar, interactions, the, induced, dipole, forces, appear, from, the, induction, also, termed, polarization, which, is, the, attractive, interaction, between, a, permanent, multipole, on, one, molecule, with, an, induced, by, the, former, di, multi, pole, 31, on, another, this, interaction, is, called, the, debye, force, named, after, peter, j, w, debye, one, example, of, an, induction, interaction, between, permanent, dipole, and, induced, dipole, is, the, interaction, between, hcl, and, ar, in, this, system, ar, experiences, a, dipole, as, its, electrons, are, attracted, to, the, h, side, of, hcl, or, repelled, from, the, cl, side, by, hcl, the, angle, averaged, interaction, is, given, by, the, following, equation, where, 2, displaystyle, alpha, 2, polarizability, this, kind, of, interaction, can, be, expected, between, any, polar, molecule, and, non, polar, symmetrical, molecule, the, induction, interaction, force, is, far, weaker, than, dipole, dipole, interaction, but, stronger, than, the, london, dispersion, force, the, third, and, dominant, contribution, is, the, dispersion, or, london, force, fluctuating, dipole, induced, dipole, which, arises, due, to, the, non, zero, instantaneous, dipole, moments, of, all, atoms, and, molecules, such, polarization, can, be, induced, either, by, a, polar, molecule, or, by, the, repulsion, of, negatively, charged, electron, clouds, in, non, polar, molecules, thus, london, interactions, are, caused, by, random, fluctuations, of, electron, density, in, an, electron, cloud, an, atom, with, a, large, number, of, electrons, will, have, a, greater, associated, london, force, than, an, atom, with, fewer, electrons, the, dispersion, london, force, is, the, most, important, component, because, all, materials, are, polarizable, whereas, keesom, and, debye, forces, require, permanent, dipoles, the, london, interaction, is, universal, and, is, present, in, atom, atom, interactions, as, well, for, various, reasons, london, interactions, dispersion, have, been, considered, relevant, for, interactions, between, macroscopic, bodies, in, condensed, systems, hamaker, developed, the, theory, of, van, der, waals, between, macroscopic, bodies, in, 1937, and, showed, that, the, additivity, of, these, interactions, renders, them, considerably, more, long, range, kj, mol, this, comparison, is, approximate, the, actual, relative, strengths, will, vary, depending, on, the, molecules, involved, for, instance, the, presence, of, water, creates, competing, interactions, that, greatly, weaken, the, strength, of, both, ionic, and, hydrogen, bonds, we, may, consider, that, for, static, systems, ionic, bonding, and, covalent, bonding, will, always, be, stronger, than, intermolecular, forces, in, any, given, substance, but, it, is, not, so, for, big, moving, systems, like, enzyme, molecules, interacting, with, substrate, molecules, here, the, numerous, intramolecular, most, often, hydrogen, bonds, bonds, form, an, active, intermediate, state, where, the, intermolecular, bonds, cause, some, of, the, covalent, bond, to, be, broken, while, the, others, are, formed, in, this, way, proceeding, the, thousands, of, enzymatic, reactions, so, important, for, living, organisms, intermolecular, forces, are, repulsive, at, short, distances, and, attractive, at, long, distances, see, the, lennard, jones, potential, in, a, gas, the, repulsive, force, chiefly, has, the, effect, of, keeping, two, molecules, from, occupying, the, same, volume, this, gives, a, real, gas, a, tendency, to, occupy, a, larger, volume, than, an, ideal, gas, at, the, same, temperature, and, pressure, the, attractive, force, draws, molecules, closer, together, and, gives, a, real, gas, a, tendency, to, occupy, a, smaller, volume, than, an, ideal, gas, which, interaction, is, more, important, depends, on, temperature, and, pressure, see, compressibility, factor, in, a, gas, the, distances, between, molecules, are, generally, large, so, intermolecular, forces, have, only, a, small, effect, the, attractive, force, is, not, overcome, by, the, repulsive, force, but, by, the, thermal, energy, of, the, molecules, temperature, is, the, measure, of, thermal, energy, so, increasing, temperature, reduces, the, influence, of, the, attractive, force, in, contrast, the, influence, of, the, repulsive, force, is, essentially, unaffected, by, temperature, when, a, gas, is, compressed, to, increase, its, density, the, influence, of, the, attractive, force, increases, if, the, gas, is, made, sufficiently, dense, the, attractions, can, become, large, enough, to, overcome, the, tendency, of, thermal, motion, to, cause, the, molecules, to, disperse, then, the, gas, can, condense, to, form, a, solid, or, liquid, i, e, a, condensed, phase, lower, temperature, favors, the, formation, of, a, condensed, phase, in, a, condensed, phase, there, is, very, nearly, a, balance, between, the, attractive, and, repulsive, forces, intermolecular, forces, observed, between, atoms, and, molecules, can, be, described, phenomenologically, as, occurring, between, permanent, and, instantaneous, dipoles, as, outlined, above, alternatively, one, may, seek, a, fundamental, unifying, theory, that, is, able, to, explain, the, various, types, of, interactions, such, as, hydrogen, bonding, van, der, waals, force, and, dipole, dipole, interactions, typically, this, is, done, by, applying, the, ideas, of, quantum, mechanics, to, molecules, and, rayleigh, schr, dinger, perturbation, theory, has, been, especially, effective, in, this, regard, when, applied, to, existing, quantum, chemistry, methods, such, a, quantum, mechanical, explanation, of, intermolecular, interactions, provides, an, array, of, approximate, methods, that, can, be, used, to, analyze, intermolecular, interactions, one, of, the, most, helpful, methods, to, visualize, this, kind, of, intermolecular, interactions, that, we, can, find, in, quantum, chemistry, is, the, non, covalent, interaction, index, which, is, based, on, the, electron, density, of, the, system, london, dispersion, forces, play, a, big, role, with, this, concerning, electron, density, topology, recent, methods, based, on, electron, density, gradient, methods, have, emerged, recently, notably, with, the, development, of, ibsi, intrinsic, bond, strength, index, relying, on, the, igm, independent, gradient, model, methodology
