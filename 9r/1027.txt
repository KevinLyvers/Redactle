particle, physics, or, high, energy, physics, is, the, study, of, fundamental, particles, and, forces, that, constitute, matter, and, radiation, the, field, also, studies, combinations, of, elementary, particles, up, to, the, scale, of, protons, and, neutrons, while, the, study, of, combination, of, protons, and, neutrons, is, called, nuclear, physics, the, fundamental, particles, in, the, universe, are, classified, in, the, standard, model, as, fermions, matter, particles, and, bosons, force, carrying, particles, there, are, three, generations, of, fermions, although, ordinary, matter, is, made, only, from, the, first, fermion, generation, the, first, generation, consists, of, up, and, down, quarks, which, form, protons, and, neutrons, and, electrons, and, electron, neutrinos, the, three, fundamental, interactions, known, to, be, mediated, by, bosons, are, electromagnetism, the, weak, interaction, and, the, strong, interaction, quarks, cannot, exist, on, their, own, but, form, hadrons, hadrons, that, contain, an, odd, number, of, quarks, are, called, baryons, and, those, that, contain, an, even, number, are, called, mesons, two, baryons, the, proton, and, the, neutron, make, up, most, of, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, mesons, are, unstable, and, the, longest, lived, last, for, only, a, few, hundredths, of, a, microsecond, they, occur, after, collisions, between, particles, made, of, quarks, such, as, fast, moving, protons, and, neutrons, in, cosmic, rays, mesons, are, also, produced, in, cyclotrons, or, other, particle, accelerators, particles, have, corresponding, antiparticles, with, the, same, mass, but, with, opposite, electric, charges, for, example, the, antiparticle, of, the, electron, is, the, positron, the, electron, has, a, negative, electric, charge, the, positron, has, a, positive, charge, these, antiparticles, can, theoretically, form, a, corresponding, form, of, matter, called, antimatter, some, particles, such, as, the, photon, are, their, own, antiparticle, these, elementary, particles, are, excitations, of, the, quantum, fields, that, also, govern, their, interactions, the, dominant, theory, explaining, these, fundamental, particles, and, fields, along, with, their, dynamics, is, called, the, standard, model, the, reconciliation, of, gravity, to, the, current, particle, physics, theory, is, not, solved, many, theories, have, addressed, this, problem, such, as, loop, quantum, gravity, string, theory, and, supersymmetry, theory, practical, particle, physics, is, the, study, of, these, particles, in, radioactive, processes, and, in, particle, accelerators, such, as, the, large, hadron, collider, theoretical, particle, physics, is, the, study, of, these, particles, in, the, context, of, cosmology, and, quantum, theory, the, two, are, closely, interrelated, the, higgs, boson, was, postulated, by, theoretical, particle, physicists, and, its, presence, confirmed, by, practical, experiments, the, idea, that, all, matter, is, fundamentally, composed, of, elementary, particles, dates, from, at, least, the, 6th, century, bc, in, the, 19th, century, john, dalton, through, his, work, on, stoichiometry, concluded, that, each, element, of, nature, was, composed, of, a, single, unique, type, of, particle, the, word, atom, after, the, greek, word, atomos, meaning, indivisible, has, since, then, denoted, the, smallest, particle, of, a, chemical, element, but, physicists, later, discovered, that, atoms, are, not, in, fact, the, fundamental, particles, of, nature, but, are, conglomerates, of, even, smaller, particles, such, as, the, electron, the, early, 20th, century, explorations, of, nuclear, physics, and, quantum, physics, led, to, proofs, of, nuclear, fission, in, 1939, by, lise, meitner, based, on, experiments, by, otto, hahn, and, nuclear, fusion, by, hans, bethe, in, that, same, year, both, discoveries, also, led, to, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, throughout, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, a, bewildering, variety, of, particles, was, found, in, collisions, of, particles, from, beams, of, increasingly, high, energy, it, was, referred, to, informally, as, the, particle, zoo, important, discoveries, such, as, the, cp, violation, by, james, cronin, and, val, fitch, brought, new, questions, to, matter, antimatter, imbalance, after, the, formulation, of, the, standard, model, during, the, 1970s, physicists, clarified, the, origin, of, the, particle, zoo, the, large, number, of, particles, was, explained, as, combinations, of, a, relatively, small, number, of, more, fundamental, particles, and, framed, in, the, context, of, quantum, field, theories, this, reclassification, marked, the, beginning, of, modern, particle, physics, the, current, state, of, the, classification, of, all, elementary, particles, is, explained, by, the, standard, model, which, gained, widespread, acceptance, in, the, mid, 1970s, after, experimental, confirmation, of, the, existence, of, quarks, it, describes, the, strong, weak, and, electromagnetic, fundamental, interactions, using, mediating, gauge, bosons, the, species, of, gauge, bosons, are, eight, gluons, w, w, and, z, bosons, and, the, photon, the, standard, model, also, contains, 24, fundamental, fermions, 12, particles, and, their, associated, anti, particles, which, are, the, constituents, of, all, matter, finally, the, standard, model, also, predicted, the, existence, of, a, type, of, boson, known, as, the, higgs, boson, on, 4, july, 2012, physicists, with, the, large, hadron, collider, at, cern, announced, they, had, found, a, new, particle, that, behaves, similarly, to, what, is, expected, from, the, higgs, boson, the, standard, model, as, currently, formulated, has, 61, elementary, particles, those, elementary, particles, can, combine, to, form, composite, particles, accounting, for, the, hundreds, of, other, species, of, particles, that, have, been, discovered, since, the, 1960s, the, standard, model, has, been, found, to, agree, with, almost, all, the, experimental, tests, conducted, to, date, however, most, particle, physicists, believe, that, it, is, an, incomplete, description, of, nature, and, that, a, more, fundamental, theory, awaits, discovery, see, theory, of, everything, in, recent, years, measurements, of, neutrino, mass, have, provided, the, first, experimental, deviations, from, the, standard, model, since, neutrinos, do, not, have, mass, in, the, standard, model, modern, particle, physics, research, is, focused, on, subatomic, particles, including, atomic, constituents, such, as, electrons, protons, and, neutrons, protons, and, neutrons, are, composite, particles, called, baryons, made, of, quarks, that, are, produced, by, radioactive, and, scattering, processes, such, particles, are, photons, neutrinos, and, muons, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, exotic, particles, all, particles, and, their, interactions, observed, to, date, can, be, described, almost, entirely, by, the, standard, model, dynamics, of, particles, are, also, governed, by, quantum, mechanics, they, exhibit, wave, particle, duality, displaying, particle, like, behaviour, under, certain, experimental, conditions, and, wave, like, behaviour, in, others, in, more, technical, terms, they, are, described, by, quantum, state, vectors, in, a, hilbert, space, which, is, also, treated, in, quantum, field, theory, following, the, convention, of, particle, physicists, the, term, elementary, particles, is, applied, to, those, particles, that, are, according, to, current, understanding, presumed, to, be, indivisible, and, not, composed, of, other, particles, ordinary, matter, is, made, from, first, generation, quarks, up, down, and, leptons, electron, electron, neutrino, collectively, quarks, and, leptons, are, called, fermions, because, they, have, a, quantum, spin, of, half, integers, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, etc, this, causes, the, fermions, to, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, where, no, two, particles, may, occupy, the, same, quantum, state, quarks, have, fractional, elementary, electric, charge, 1, 3, or, 2, 3, and, leptons, have, whole, numbered, electric, charge, 0, or, 1, quarks, also, have, color, charge, which, is, labeled, arbitrarily, with, no, correlation, to, actual, light, color, as, red, green, and, blue, because, the, interactions, between, the, quarks, store, energy, which, can, convert, to, other, particles, when, the, quarks, are, far, apart, enough, quarks, cannot, be, observed, independently, this, is, called, color, confinement, there, are, three, known, generations, of, quarks, up, and, down, strange, and, charm, top, and, bottom, and, leptons, electron, and, its, neutrino, muon, and, its, neutrino, tau, and, its, neutrino, with, strong, indirect, evidence, that, a, fourth, generation, of, fermions, does, not, exist, bosons, are, the, mediators, or, carriers, of, fundamental, interactions, such, as, electromagnetism, the, weak, interaction, and, the, strong, interaction, electromagnetism, is, mediated, by, the, photon, the, quanta, of, light, 29, 30, the, weak, interaction, is, mediated, by, the, w, and, z, bosons, the, strong, interaction, is, mediated, by, the, gluon, which, can, link, quarks, together, to, form, composite, particles, due, to, the, aforementioned, color, confinement, gluons, are, never, observed, independently, the, higgs, boson, gives, mass, to, the, w, and, z, bosons, via, the, higgs, mechanism, the, gluon, and, photon, are, expected, to, be, massless, all, bosons, have, an, integer, quantum, spin, 0, and, 1, and, can, have, the, same, quantum, state, most, aforementioned, particles, have, corresponding, antiparticles, which, compose, antimatter, normal, particles, have, positive, lepton, or, baryon, number, and, antiparticles, have, these, numbers, negative, most, properties, of, corresponding, antiparticles, and, particles, are, the, same, with, a, few, gets, reversed, the, electron, s, antiparticle, positron, has, an, opposite, charge, to, differentiate, between, antiparticles, and, particles, a, plus, or, negative, sign, is, added, in, superscript, for, example, the, electron, and, the, positron, are, denoted, e, and, e, when, a, particle, and, an, antiparticle, interact, with, each, other, they, are, annihilated, and, convert, to, other, particles, some, particles, such, as, the, photon, or, gluon, have, no, antiparticles, quarks, and, gluons, additionally, have, color, charges, which, influences, the, strong, interaction, quark, s, color, charges, are, called, red, green, and, blue, though, the, particle, itself, have, no, physical, color, and, in, antiquarks, are, called, antired, antigreen, and, antiblue, the, gluon, can, have, eight, color, charges, which, are, the, result, of, quarks, interactions, to, form, composite, particles, gauge, symmetry, su, 3, the, neutrons, and, protons, in, the, atomic, nuclei, are, baryons, the, neutron, is, composed, of, two, down, quarks, and, one, up, quark, and, the, proton, is, composed, of, two, up, quarks, and, one, down, quark, a, baryon, is, composed, of, three, quarks, and, a, meson, is, composed, of, two, quarks, one, normal, one, anti, baryons, and, mesons, are, collectively, called, hadrons, quarks, inside, hadrons, are, governed, by, the, strong, interaction, thus, are, subjected, to, quantum, chromodynamics, color, charges, the, bounded, quarks, must, have, their, color, charge, to, be, neutral, or, white, for, analogy, with, mixing, the, primary, colors, more, exotic, hadrons, can, have, other, types, arrangement, or, number, of, quarks, tetraquark, pentaquark, an, atom, is, made, from, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, by, modifying, the, particles, inside, a, normal, atom, exotic, atoms, can, be, formed, a, simple, example, would, be, the, hydrogen, 4, 1, which, has, one, of, its, electrons, replaced, with, a, muon, the, graviton, is, a, hypothetical, particle, that, can, mediate, the, gravitational, interaction, but, it, has, not, been, detected, or, completely, reconciled, with, current, theories, many, other, hypothetical, particles, have, been, proposed, to, address, the, limitations, of, the, standard, model, notably, supersymmetric, particles, aim, to, solve, the, hierarchy, problem, axions, address, the, strong, cp, problem, and, various, other, particles, are, proposed, to, explain, the, origins, of, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, the, world, s, major, particle, physics, laboratories, are, theoretical, particle, physics, attempts, to, develop, the, models, theoretical, framework, and, mathematical, tools, to, understand, current, experiments, and, make, predictions, for, future, experiments, see, also, theoretical, physics, there, are, several, major, interrelated, efforts, being, made, in, theoretical, particle, physics, today, one, important, branch, attempts, to, better, understand, the, standard, model, and, its, tests, theorists, make, quantitative, predictions, of, observables, at, collider, and, astronomical, experiments, which, along, with, experimental, measurements, is, used, to, extract, the, parameters, of, the, standard, model, with, less, uncertainty, this, work, probes, the, limits, of, the, standard, model, and, therefore, expands, scientific, understanding, of, nature, s, building, blocks, those, efforts, are, made, challenging, by, the, difficulty, of, calculating, high, precision, quantities, in, quantum, chromodynamics, some, theorists, working, in, this, area, use, the, tools, of, perturbative, quantum, field, theory, and, effective, field, theory, referring, to, themselves, as, phenomenologists, others, make, use, of, lattice, field, theory, and, call, themselves, lattice, theorists, another, major, effort, is, in, model, building, where, model, builders, develop, ideas, for, what, physics, may, lie, beyond, the, standard, model, at, higher, energies, or, smaller, distances, this, work, is, often, motivated, by, the, hierarchy, problem, and, is, constrained, by, existing, experimental, data, it, may, involve, work, on, supersymmetry, alternatives, to, the, higgs, mechanism, extra, spatial, dimensions, such, as, the, randall, sundrum, models, preon, theory, combinations, of, these, or, other, ideas, vanishing, dimensions, theory, is, a, particle, physics, theory, suggesting, that, systems, with, higher, energy, have, a, smaller, number, of, dimensions, a, third, major, effort, in, theoretical, particle, physics, is, string, theory, string, theorists, attempt, to, construct, a, unified, description, of, quantum, mechanics, and, general, relativity, by, building, a, theory, based, on, small, strings, and, branes, rather, than, particles, if, the, theory, is, successful, it, may, be, considered, a, theory, of, everything, or, toe, there, are, also, other, areas, of, work, in, theoretical, particle, physics, ranging, from, particle, cosmology, to, loop, quantum, gravity, in, principle, all, physics, and, practical, applications, developed, therefrom, can, be, derived, from, the, study, of, fundamental, particles, in, practice, even, if, particle, physics, is, taken, to, mean, only, high, energy, atom, smashers, many, technologies, have, been, developed, during, these, pioneering, investigations, that, later, find, wide, uses, in, society, particle, accelerators, are, used, to, produce, medical, isotopes, for, research, and, treatment, for, example, isotopes, used, in, pet, imaging, or, used, directly, in, external, beam, radiotherapy, the, development, of, superconductors, has, been, pushed, forward, by, their, use, in, particle, physics, the, world, wide, web, and, touchscreen, technology, were, initially, developed, at, cern, additional, applications, are, found, in, medicine, national, security, industry, computing, science, and, workforce, development, illustrating, a, long, and, growing, list, of, beneficial, practical, applications, with, contributions, from, particle, physics, major, efforts, to, look, for, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, include, the, future, circular, collider, proposed, for, cern, and, the, particle, physics, project, prioritization, panel, p5, in, the, us, that, will, update, the, 2014, p5, study, that, recommended, the, deep, underground, neutrino, experiment, among, other, experiments
