tropical, rainforests, are, dense, and, warm, rainforests, with, high, rainfall, typically, found, between, 10, north, and, south, of, the, equator, they, are, a, subset, of, the, tropical, forest, biome, that, occurs, roughly, within, the, 28, latitudes, in, the, torrid, zone, between, the, tropic, of, cancer, and, tropic, of, capricorn, tropical, rainforests, are, a, type, of, tropical, moist, broadleaf, forest, that, includes, the, more, extensive, seasonal, tropical, forests, true, rainforests, usually, occur, in, tropical, rainforest, climates, where, no, dry, season, occurs, all, months, have, an, average, precipitation, of, at, least, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, seasonal, tropical, forests, with, tropical, monsoon, or, savanna, climates, are, sometimes, included, in, the, broader, definition, tropical, rainforests, ecosystems, are, distinguished, by, their, consistent, high, temperatures, exceeding, 18, c, 64, f, monthly, and, substantial, annual, rainfall, the, abundant, rainfall, results, in, nutrient, poor, leached, soils, which, profoundly, affect, the, flora, and, fauna, adapted, to, these, conditions, these, rainforests, are, renowned, for, their, significant, biodiversity, they, are, home, to, 40, 75, of, all, species, globally, including, half, of, the, world, s, animal, and, plant, species, and, two, thirds, of, all, flowering, plant, species, their, dense, insect, population, and, variety, of, trees, and, higher, plants, are, notable, described, as, the, world, s, largest, pharmacy, over, a, quarter, of, natural, medicines, have, been, discovered, in, them, however, tropical, rainforests, are, threatened, by, human, activities, such, as, logging, and, agricultural, expansion, leading, to, habitat, fragmentation, and, loss, the, structure, of, a, tropical, rainforest, is, stratified, into, layers, each, hosting, unique, ecosystems, these, include, the, emergent, layer, with, towering, trees, the, densely, populated, canopy, layer, the, understory, layer, rich, in, wildlife, and, the, forest, floor, which, is, sparse, due, to, low, light, penetration, the, soil, is, characteristically, nutrient, poor, and, acidic, tropical, rainforests, have, a, long, history, of, ecological, succession, influenced, by, natural, events, and, human, activities, they, are, crucial, for, global, ecological, functions, including, carbon, sequestration, and, climate, regulation, many, indigenous, peoples, around, the, world, have, inhabited, rainforests, for, millennia, relying, on, them, for, sustenance, and, shelter, but, face, challenges, from, modern, economic, activities, conservation, efforts, are, diverse, focusing, on, both, preservation, and, sustainable, management, international, policies, such, as, the, reducing, emissions, from, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, redd, and, redd, programs, aim, to, curb, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, despite, these, efforts, tropical, rainforests, continue, to, face, significant, threats, from, deforestation, and, climate, change, highlighting, the, ongoing, challenge, of, balancing, conservation, with, human, development, needs, tropical, rainforests, are, hot, and, wet, mean, monthly, temperatures, exceed, 18, c, 64, f, during, all, months, of, the, year, average, annual, rainfall, is, no, less, than, 1, 680, mm, 66, in, and, can, exceed, 10, m, 390, in, although, it, typically, lies, between, 1, 750, mm, 69, in, and, 3, 000, mm, 120, in, this, high, level, of, precipitation, often, results, in, poor, soils, due, to, leaching, of, soluble, nutrients, in, the, ground, tropical, rainforests, exhibit, high, levels, of, biodiversity, around, 40, to, 75, of, all, biotic, species, are, indigenous, to, the, rainforests, rainforests, are, home, to, half, of, all, the, living, animal, and, plant, species, on, the, planet, two, thirds, of, all, flowering, plants, can, be, found, in, rainforests, a, single, hectare, of, rainforest, may, contain, 42, 000, different, species, of, insect, up, to, 807, trees, of, 313, species, and, 1, 500, species, of, higher, plants, tropical, rainforests, have, been, called, the, world, s, largest, pharmacy, because, over, one, quarter, of, natural, medicines, have, been, discovered, within, them, it, is, likely, that, there, may, be, many, millions, of, species, of, plants, insects, and, microorganisms, still, undiscovered, in, tropical, rainforests, tropical, rainforests, are, among, the, most, threatened, ecosystems, globally, due, to, large, scale, fragmentation, as, a, result, of, human, activity, habitat, fragmentation, caused, by, geological, processes, such, as, volcanism, and, climate, change, occurred, in, the, past, and, have, been, identified, as, important, drivers, of, speciation, however, fast, human, driven, habitat, destruction, is, suspected, to, be, one, of, the, major, causes, of, species, extinction, tropical, rain, forests, have, been, subjected, to, heavy, logging, and, agricultural, clearance, throughout, the, 20th, century, and, the, area, covered, by, rainforests, around, the, world, is, rapidly, shrinking, tropical, rainforests, have, existed, on, earth, for, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, most, tropical, rainforests, today, are, on, fragments, of, the, mesozoic, era, supercontinent, of, gondwana, the, separation, of, the, landmass, resulted, in, a, great, loss, of, amphibian, diversity, while, at, the, same, time, the, drier, climate, spurred, the, diversification, of, reptiles, the, division, left, tropical, rainforests, located, in, five, major, regions, of, the, world, tropical, america, africa, southeast, asia, madagascar, and, new, guinea, with, smaller, outliers, in, australia, however, the, specifics, of, the, origin, of, rainforests, remain, uncertain, due, to, an, incomplete, fossil, record, several, biomes, may, appear, similar, to, or, merge, via, ecotones, with, tropical, rainforest, moist, seasonal, tropical, forests, receive, high, overall, rainfall, with, a, warm, summer, wet, season, and, a, cooler, winter, dry, season, these, forests, usually, fall, under, tropical, monsoon, or, tropical, savanna, climates, some, trees, in, these, forests, drop, some, or, all, of, their, leaves, during, the, winter, dry, season, thus, they, are, sometimes, called, tropical, mixed, forest, they, are, found, in, parts, of, south, america, in, central, america, and, around, the, caribbean, in, coastal, west, africa, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, and, across, much, of, indochina, these, are, found, in, cooler, climate, mountainous, areas, becoming, known, as, cloud, forests, at, higher, elevations, depending, on, latitude, the, lower, limit, of, montane, rainforests, on, large, mountains, is, generally, between, 1500, and, 2500, m, while, the, upper, limit, is, usually, from, 2400, to, 3300, m, tropical, freshwater, swamp, forests, or, flooded, forests, are, found, in, amazon, basin, the, v, rzea, and, elsewhere, rainforests, are, divided, into, different, strata, or, layers, with, vegetation, organized, into, a, vertical, pattern, from, the, top, of, the, soil, to, the, canopy, each, layer, is, a, unique, biotic, community, containing, different, plants, and, animals, adapted, for, life, in, that, particular, strata, only, the, emergent, layer, is, unique, to, tropical, rainforests, while, the, others, are, also, found, in, temperate, rainforests, the, forest, floor, the, bottom, most, layer, receives, only, 2, of, the, sunlight, only, plants, adapted, to, low, light, can, grow, in, this, region, away, from, riverbanks, swamps, and, clearings, where, dense, undergrowth, is, found, the, forest, floor, is, relatively, clear, of, vegetation, because, of, the, low, sunlight, penetration, this, more, open, quality, permits, the, easy, movement, of, larger, animals, such, as, ungulates, like, the, okapi, okapia, johnstoni, tapir, tapirus, sp, sumatran, rhinoceros, dicerorhinus, sumatrensis, and, apes, like, the, western, lowland, gorilla, gorilla, gorilla, as, well, as, many, species, of, reptiles, amphibians, and, insects, the, forest, floor, also, contains, decaying, plant, and, animal, matter, which, disappears, quickly, because, the, warm, humid, conditions, promote, rapid, decay, many, forms, of, fungi, growing, here, help, decay, the, animal, and, plant, waste, the, understory, layer, lies, between, the, canopy, and, the, forest, floor, the, understory, is, home, to, a, number, of, birds, small, mammals, insects, reptiles, and, predators, examples, include, leopard, panthera, pardus, poison, dart, frogs, dendrobates, sp, ring, tailed, coati, nasua, nasua, boa, constrictor, boa, constrictor, and, many, species, of, coleoptera, the, vegetation, at, this, layer, generally, consists, of, shade, tolerant, shrubs, herbs, small, trees, and, large, woody, vines, which, climb, into, the, trees, to, capture, sunlight, only, about, 5, of, sunlight, breaches, the, canopy, to, arrive, at, the, understory, causing, true, understory, plants, to, seldom, grow, to, 3, m, 10, feet, as, an, adaptation, to, these, low, light, levels, understory, plants, have, often, evolved, much, larger, leaves, many, seedlings, that, will, grow, to, the, canopy, level, are, in, the, understory, the, canopy, is, the, primary, layer, of, the, forest, forming, a, roof, over, the, two, remaining, layers, it, contains, the, majority, of, the, largest, trees, typically, 30, 45, m, in, height, tall, broad, leaved, evergreen, trees, are, the, dominant, plants, the, densest, areas, of, biodiversity, are, found, in, the, forest, canopy, as, it, often, supports, a, rich, flora, of, epiphytes, including, orchids, bromeliads, mosses, and, lichens, these, epiphytic, plants, attach, to, trunks, and, branches, and, obtain, water, and, minerals, from, rain, and, debris, that, collects, on, the, supporting, plants, the, fauna, is, similar, to, that, found, in, the, emergent, layer, but, more, diverse, it, is, suggested, that, the, total, arthropod, species, richness, of, the, tropical, canopy, might, be, as, high, as, 20, million, other, species, inhabiting, this, layer, include, many, avian, species, such, as, the, yellow, casqued, wattled, hornbill, ceratogymna, elata, collared, sunbird, anthreptes, collaris, grey, parrot, psitacus, erithacus, keel, billed, toucan, ramphastos, sulfuratus, scarlet, macaw, ara, macao, as, well, as, other, animals, like, the, spider, monkey, ateles, sp, african, giant, swallowtail, papilio, antimachus, three, toed, sloth, bradypus, tridactylus, kinkajou, potos, flavus, and, tamandua, tamandua, tetradactyla, the, emergent, layer, contains, a, small, number, of, very, large, trees, called, emergents, which, grow, above, the, general, canopy, reaching, heights, of, 45, 55, m, although, on, occasion, a, few, species, will, grow, to, 70, 80, m, tall, some, examples, of, emergents, include, hydrochorea, elegans, dipteryx, panamensis, hieronyma, alchorneoides, hymenolobium, mesoamericanum, lecythis, ampla, and, terminalia, oblonga, these, trees, need, to, be, able, to, withstand, the, hot, temperatures, and, strong, winds, that, occur, above, the, canopy, in, some, areas, several, unique, faunal, species, inhabit, this, layer, such, as, the, crowned, eagle, stephanoaetus, coronatus, the, king, colobus, colobus, polykomos, and, the, large, flying, fox, pteropus, vampyrus, however, stratification, is, not, always, clear, rainforests, are, dynamic, and, many, changes, affect, the, structure, of, the, forest, emergent, or, canopy, trees, collapse, for, example, causing, gaps, to, form, openings, in, the, forest, canopy, are, widely, recognized, as, important, for, the, establishment, and, growth, of, rainforest, trees, it, is, estimated, that, perhaps, 75, of, the, tree, species, at, la, selva, biological, station, costa, rica, are, dependent, on, canopy, opening, for, seed, germination, or, for, growth, beyond, sapling, size, for, example, tropical, rainforests, are, located, around, and, near, the, equator, therefore, having, what, is, called, an, equatorial, climate, characterized, by, three, major, climatic, parameters, temperature, rainfall, and, dry, season, intensity, other, parameters, that, affect, tropical, rainforests, are, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, solar, radiation, and, nitrogen, availability, in, general, climatic, patterns, consist, of, warm, temperatures, and, high, annual, rainfall, however, the, abundance, of, rainfall, changes, throughout, the, year, creating, distinct, moist, and, dry, seasons, tropical, forests, are, classified, by, the, amount, of, rainfall, received, each, year, which, has, allowed, ecologists, to, define, differences, in, these, forests, that, look, so, similar, in, structure, according, to, holdridge, s, classification, of, tropical, ecosystems, true, tropical, rainforests, have, an, annual, rainfall, greater, than, 2, m, and, annual, temperature, greater, than, 24, degrees, celsius, with, a, potential, evapotranspiration, ratio, pet, value, of, 0, 25, however, most, lowland, tropical, forests, can, be, classified, as, tropical, moist, or, wet, forests, which, differ, in, regards, to, rainfall, tropical, forest, ecology, dynamics, composition, and, function, are, sensitive, to, changes, in, climate, especially, changes, in, rainfall, soil, types, are, highly, variable, in, the, tropics, and, are, the, result, of, a, combination, of, several, variables, such, as, climate, vegetation, topographic, position, parent, material, and, soil, age, most, tropical, soils, are, characterized, by, significant, leaching, and, poor, nutrients, however, there, are, some, areas, that, contain, fertile, soils, soils, throughout, the, tropical, rainforests, fall, into, two, classifications, which, include, the, ultisols, and, oxisols, ultisols, are, known, as, well, weathered, acidic, red, clay, soils, deficient, in, major, nutrients, such, as, calcium, and, potassium, similarly, oxisols, are, acidic, old, typically, reddish, highly, weathered, and, leached, however, are, well, drained, compared, to, ultisols, the, clay, content, of, ultisols, is, high, making, it, difficult, for, water, to, penetrate, and, flow, through, the, reddish, color, of, both, soils, is, the, result, of, heavy, heat, and, moisture, forming, oxides, of, iron, and, aluminium, which, are, insoluble, in, water, and, not, taken, up, readily, by, plants, soil, chemical, and, physical, characteristics, are, strongly, related, to, above, ground, productivity, and, forest, structure, and, dynamics, the, physical, properties, of, soil, control, the, tree, turnover, rates, whereas, chemical, properties, such, as, available, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, control, forest, growth, rates, the, soils, of, the, eastern, and, central, amazon, as, well, as, the, southeast, asian, rainforest, are, old, and, mineral, poor, whereas, the, soils, of, the, western, amazon, ecuador, and, peru, and, volcanic, areas, of, costa, rica, are, young, and, mineral, rich, primary, productivity, or, wood, production, is, highest, in, western, amazon, and, lowest, in, eastern, amazon, which, contains, heavily, weathered, soils, classified, as, oxisols, additionally, amazonian, soils, are, greatly, weathered, making, them, devoid, of, minerals, like, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and, magnesium, which, come, from, rock, sources, however, not, all, tropical, rainforests, occur, on, nutrient, poor, soils, but, on, nutrient, rich, floodplains, and, volcanic, soils, located, in, the, andean, foothills, and, volcanic, areas, of, southeast, asia, africa, and, central, america, oxisols, infertile, deeply, weathered, and, severely, leached, have, developed, on, the, ancient, gondwanan, shields, rapid, bacterial, decay, prevents, the, accumulation, of, humus, the, concentration, of, iron, and, aluminium, oxides, by, the, laterization, process, gives, the, oxisols, a, bright, red, color, and, sometimes, produces, minable, deposits, e, g, bauxite, on, younger, substrates, especially, of, volcanic, origin, tropical, soils, may, be, quite, fertile, this, high, rate, of, decomposition, is, the, result, of, phosphorus, levels, in, the, soils, precipitation, high, temperatures, and, the, extensive, microorganism, communities, in, addition, to, the, bacteria, and, other, microorganisms, there, are, an, abundance, of, other, decomposers, such, as, fungi, and, termites, that, aid, in, the, process, as, well, nutrient, recycling, is, important, because, below, ground, resource, availability, controls, the, above, ground, biomass, and, community, structure, of, tropical, rainforests, these, soils, are, typically, phosphorus, limited, which, inhibits, net, primary, productivity, or, the, uptake, of, carbon, the, soil, contains, microbial, organisms, such, as, bacteria, which, break, down, leaf, litter, and, other, organic, matter, into, inorganic, forms, of, carbon, usable, by, plants, through, a, process, called, decomposition, during, the, decomposition, process, the, microbial, community, is, respiring, taking, up, oxygen, and, releasing, carbon, dioxide, the, decomposition, rate, can, be, evaluated, by, measuring, the, uptake, of, oxygen, high, temperatures, and, precipitation, increase, decomposition, rate, which, allows, plant, litter, to, rapidly, decay, in, tropical, regions, releasing, nutrients, that, are, immediately, taken, up, by, plants, through, surface, or, ground, waters, the, seasonal, patterns, in, respiration, are, controlled, by, leaf, litter, fall, and, precipitation, the, driving, force, moving, the, decomposable, carbon, from, the, litter, to, the, soil, respiration, rates, are, highest, early, in, the, wet, season, because, the, recent, dry, season, results, in, a, large, percentage, of, leaf, litter, and, thus, a, higher, percentage, of, organic, matter, being, leached, into, the, soil, a, common, feature, of, many, tropical, rainforests, is, the, distinct, buttress, roots, of, trees, instead, of, penetrating, to, deeper, soil, layers, buttress, roots, create, a, widespread, root, network, at, the, surface, for, more, efficient, uptake, of, nutrients, in, a, very, nutrient, poor, and, competitive, environment, most, of, the, nutrients, within, the, soil, of, a, tropical, rainforest, occur, near, the, surface, because, of, the, rapid, turnover, time, and, decomposition, of, organisms, and, leaves, because, of, this, the, buttress, roots, occur, at, the, surface, so, the, trees, can, maximize, uptake, and, actively, compete, with, the, rapid, uptake, of, other, trees, these, roots, also, aid, in, water, uptake, and, storage, increase, surface, area, for, gas, exchange, and, collect, leaf, litter, for, added, nutrition, additionally, these, roots, reduce, soil, erosion, and, maximize, nutrient, acquisition, during, heavy, rains, by, diverting, nutrient, rich, water, flowing, down, the, trunk, into, several, smaller, flows, while, also, acting, as, a, barrier, to, ground, flow, also, the, large, surface, areas, these, roots, create, provide, support, and, stability, to, rainforests, trees, which, commonly, grow, to, significant, heights, this, added, stability, allows, these, trees, to, withstand, the, impacts, of, severe, storms, thus, reducing, the, occurrence, of, fallen, trees, succession, is, an, ecological, process, that, changes, the, biotic, community, structure, over, time, towards, a, more, stable, diverse, community, structure, after, an, initial, disturbance, to, the, community, the, initial, disturbance, is, often, a, natural, phenomenon, or, human, caused, event, natural, disturbances, include, hurricanes, volcanic, eruptions, river, movements, or, an, event, as, small, as, a, fallen, tree, that, creates, gaps, in, the, forest, in, tropical, rainforests, these, same, natural, disturbances, have, been, well, documented, in, the, fossil, record, and, are, credited, with, encouraging, speciation, and, endemism, human, land, use, practices, have, led, to, large, scale, deforestation, in, many, tropical, countries, such, as, costa, rica, these, deforested, lands, have, been, abandoned, and, forests, have, been, allowed, to, regenerate, through, ecological, succession, these, regenerating, young, successional, forests, are, called, secondary, forests, or, second, growth, forests, tropical, rainforests, exhibit, a, vast, diversity, in, plant, and, animal, species, the, root, for, this, remarkable, speciation, has, been, a, query, of, scientists, and, ecologists, for, years, a, number, of, theories, have, been, developed, for, why, and, how, the, tropics, can, be, so, diverse, interspecific, competition, results, from, a, high, density, of, species, with, similar, niches, in, the, tropics, and, limited, resources, available, species, which, lose, the, competition, may, either, become, extinct, or, find, a, new, niche, direct, competition, will, often, lead, to, one, species, dominating, another, by, some, advantage, ultimately, driving, it, to, extinction, niche, partitioning, is, the, other, option, for, a, species, this, is, the, separation, and, rationing, of, necessary, resources, by, utilizing, different, habitats, food, sources, cover, or, general, behavioral, differences, a, species, with, similar, food, items, but, different, feeding, times, is, an, example, of, niche, partitioning, the, theory, of, pleistocene, refugia, was, developed, by, j, rgen, haffer, in, 1969, with, his, article, speciation, of, amazonian, forest, birds, haffer, proposed, the, explanation, for, speciation, was, the, product, of, rainforest, patches, being, separated, by, stretches, of, non, forest, vegetation, during, the, last, glacial, period, he, called, these, patches, of, rainforest, areas, refuges, and, within, these, patches, allopatric, speciation, occurred, with, the, end, of, the, glacial, period, and, increase, in, atmospheric, humidity, rainforest, began, to, expand, and, the, refuges, reconnected, this, theory, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, scientists, are, still, skeptical, of, whether, or, not, this, theory, is, legitimate, genetic, evidence, suggests, speciation, had, occurred, in, certain, taxa, 1, 2, million, years, ago, preceding, the, pleistocene, tropical, rainforests, have, harboured, human, life, for, many, millennia, with, many, indigenous, people, in, south, and, central, america, who, belong, to, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, congo, pygmies, in, central, africa, and, several, tribes, in, southeast, asia, like, the, dayak, people, and, the, penan, people, in, borneo, food, resources, within, the, forest, are, extremely, dispersed, due, to, the, high, biological, diversity, and, what, food, does, exist, is, largely, restricted, to, the, canopy, and, requires, considerable, energy, to, obtain, some, groups, of, hunter, gatherers, have, exploited, rainforest, on, a, seasonal, basis, but, dwelt, primarily, in, adjacent, savanna, and, open, forest, environments, where, food, is, much, more, abundant, other, people, described, as, rainforest, dwellers, are, hunter, gatherers, who, subsist, in, large, part, by, trading, high, value, forest, products, such, as, hides, feathers, and, honey, with, agricultural, people, living, outside, the, forest, many, indigenous, peoples, around, the, world, live, within, rainforests, as, hunter, gatherers, or, subsist, as, part, time, small, scale, farmers, supplemented, in, large, part, by, trading, high, value, forest, products, such, as, hides, feathers, and, honey, with, agricultural, people, living, outside, the, forests, peoples, have, inhabited, the, rainforests, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, and, have, remained, so, elusive, that, only, recently, have, some, tribes, been, discovered, these, indigenous, peoples, are, greatly, threatened, by, loggers, in, search, for, old, growth, tropical, hardwoods, like, ipe, cumaru, and, wenge, and, by, farmers, who, are, looking, to, expand, their, land, for, cattle, meat, and, soybeans, which, are, used, to, feed, cattle, in, europe, and, china, on, 18, january, 2007, funai, reported, also, that, it, had, confirmed, the, presence, of, 67, different, uncontacted, tribes, in, brazil, up, from, 40, in, 2005, with, this, addition, brazil, has, now, overtaken, the, island, of, new, guinea, as, the, country, having, the, largest, number, of, uncontacted, tribes, the, province, of, irian, jaya, or, west, papua, in, the, island, of, new, guinea, is, home, to, an, estimated, 44, uncontacted, tribal, groups, the, pygmy, peoples, are, hunter, gatherer, groups, living, in, equatorial, rainforests, characterized, by, their, short, height, below, one, and, a, half, meters, or, 59, inches, on, average, amongst, this, group, are, the, efe, aka, twa, baka, and, mbuti, people, of, central, africa, however, the, term, pygmy, is, considered, pejorative, so, many, tribes, prefer, not, to, be, labeled, as, such, some, notable, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, or, amerindians, include, the, huaorani, ya, nomam, and, kayapo, people, of, the, amazon, the, traditional, agricultural, system, practiced, by, tribes, in, the, amazon, is, based, on, swidden, cultivation, also, known, as, slash, and, burn, or, shifting, cultivation, and, is, considered, a, relatively, benign, disturbance, in, fact, when, looking, at, the, level, of, individual, swidden, plots, a, number, of, traditional, farming, practices, are, considered, beneficial, for, example, the, use, of, shade, trees, and, fallowing, all, help, preserve, soil, organic, matter, which, is, a, critical, factor, in, the, maintenance, of, soil, fertility, in, the, deeply, weathered, and, leached, soils, common, in, the, amazon, there, is, a, diversity, of, forest, people, in, asia, including, the, lumad, peoples, of, the, philippines, and, the, penan, and, dayak, people, of, borneo, the, dayaks, are, a, particularly, interesting, group, as, they, are, noted, for, their, traditional, headhunting, culture, fresh, human, heads, were, required, to, perform, certain, rituals, such, as, the, iban, kenyalang, and, the, kenyah, mamat, pygmies, who, live, in, southeast, asia, are, amongst, others, referred, to, as, negrito, yam, coffee, chocolate, banana, mango, papaya, macadamia, avocado, and, sugarcane, all, originally, came, from, tropical, rainforest, and, are, still, mostly, grown, on, plantations, in, regions, that, were, formerly, primary, forest, in, the, mid, 1980s, and, 1990s, 40, million, tons, of, bananas, were, consumed, worldwide, each, year, along, with, 13, million, tons, of, mango, central, american, coffee, exports, were, worth, us, 3, billion, in, 1970, much, of, the, genetic, variation, used, in, evading, the, damage, caused, by, new, pests, is, still, derived, from, resistant, wild, stock, tropical, forests, have, supplied, 250, cultivated, kinds, of, fruit, compared, to, only, 20, for, temperate, forests, forests, in, new, guinea, alone, contain, 251, tree, species, with, edible, fruits, of, which, only, 43, had, been, established, as, cultivated, crops, by, 1985, in, addition, to, extractive, human, uses, rain, forests, also, have, non, extractive, uses, that, are, frequently, summarized, as, ecosystem, services, rain, forests, play, an, important, role, in, maintaining, biological, diversity, sequestering, and, storing, carbon, global, climate, regulation, disease, control, and, pollination, half, of, the, rainfall, in, the, amazon, area, is, produced, by, the, forests, the, moisture, from, the, forests, is, important, to, the, rainfall, in, brazil, paraguay, argentina, deforestation, in, the, amazon, rainforest, region, was, one, of, the, main, reason, that, cause, the, severe, drought, of, 2014, 2015, in, brazil, for, the, last, three, decades, the, amount, of, carbon, absorbed, by, the, world, s, intact, tropical, forests, has, fallen, according, to, a, study, published, in, 2020, in, the, journal, nature, in, 2019, they, took, up, a, third, less, carbon, than, they, did, in, the, 1990s, due, to, higher, temperatures, droughts, and, deforestation, the, typical, tropical, forest, may, become, a, carbon, source, by, the, 2060s, despite, the, negative, effects, of, tourism, in, the, tropical, rainforests, there, are, also, several, important, positive, effects, deposits, of, precious, metals, gold, silver, coltan, and, fossil, fuels, oil, and, natural, gas, occur, underneath, rainforests, globally, these, resources, are, important, to, developing, nations, and, their, extraction, is, often, given, priority, to, encourage, economic, growth, mining, and, drilling, can, require, large, amounts, of, land, development, directly, causing, deforestation, in, ghana, a, west, african, nation, deforestation, from, decades, of, mining, activity, left, about, 12, of, the, country, s, original, rainforest, intact, with, the, invention, of, agriculture, humans, were, able, to, clear, sections, of, rainforest, to, produce, crops, converting, it, to, open, farmland, such, people, however, obtain, their, food, primarily, from, farm, plots, cleared, from, the, forest, and, hunt, and, forage, within, the, forest, to, supplement, this, the, issue, arising, is, between, the, independent, farmer, providing, for, his, family, and, the, needs, and, wants, of, the, globe, as, a, whole, this, issue, has, seen, little, improvement, because, no, plan, has, been, established, for, all, parties, to, be, aided, agriculture, on, formerly, forested, land, is, not, without, difficulties, rainforest, soils, are, often, thin, and, leached, of, many, minerals, and, the, heavy, rainfall, can, quickly, leach, nutrients, from, area, cleared, for, cultivation, people, such, as, the, yanomamo, of, the, amazon, utilize, slash, and, burn, agriculture, to, overcome, these, limitations, and, enable, them, to, push, deep, into, what, were, previously, rainforest, environments, however, these, are, not, rainforest, dwellers, rather, they, are, dwellers, in, cleared, farmland, that, make, forays, into, the, rainforest, up, to, 90, of, the, typical, yanamomo, diet, comes, from, farmed, plants, some, action, has, been, taken, by, suggesting, fallow, periods, of, the, land, allowing, secondary, forest, to, grow, and, replenish, the, soil, beneficial, practices, like, soil, restoration, and, conservation, can, benefit, the, small, farmer, and, allow, better, production, on, smaller, parcels, of, land, the, tropics, take, a, major, role, in, reducing, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, the, tropics, most, notably, the, amazon, rainforest, are, called, carbon, sinks, as, major, carbon, reducers, and, carbon, and, soil, methane, storages, their, destruction, contributes, to, increasing, global, energy, trapping, atmospheric, gases, climate, change, has, been, significantly, contributed, to, by, the, destruction, of, the, rainforests, a, simulation, was, performed, in, which, all, rainforest, in, africa, were, removed, the, simulation, showed, an, increase, in, atmospheric, temperature, by, 2, 5, to, 5, degrees, celsius, some, species, of, fauna, show, a, trend, towards, declining, populations, in, rainforests, for, example, reptiles, that, feed, on, amphibians, and, reptiles, this, trend, requires, close, monitoring, the, seasonality, of, rainforests, affects, the, reproductive, patterns, of, amphibians, and, this, in, turn, can, directly, affect, the, species, of, reptiles, that, feed, on, these, groups, particularly, species, with, specialized, feeding, since, these, are, less, likely, to, use, alternative, resources, efforts, to, protect, and, conserve, tropical, rainforest, habitats, are, diverse, and, widespread, tropical, rainforest, conservation, ranges, from, strict, preservation, of, habitat, to, finding, sustainable, management, techniques, for, people, living, in, tropical, rainforests, international, policy, has, also, introduced, a, market, incentive, program, called, reducing, emissions, from, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, redd, for, companies, and, governments, to, outset, their, carbon, emissions, through, financial, investments, into, rainforest, conservation
