americium, is, a, synthetic, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, am, and, atomic, number, 95, it, is, radioactive, and, a, transuranic, member, of, the, actinide, series, in, the, periodic, table, located, under, the, lanthanide, element, europium, and, was, thus, named, after, the, americas, by, analogy, americium, was, first, produced, in, 1944, by, the, group, of, glenn, t, seaborg, from, berkeley, california, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, of, the, university, of, chicago, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, although, it, is, the, third, element, in, the, transuranic, series, it, was, discovered, fourth, after, the, heavier, curium, the, discovery, was, kept, secret, and, only, released, to, the, public, in, november, 1945, most, americium, is, produced, by, uranium, or, plutonium, being, bombarded, with, neutrons, in, nuclear, reactors, one, tonne, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, contains, about, 100, grams, of, americium, it, is, widely, used, in, commercial, ionization, chamber, smoke, detectors, as, well, as, in, neutron, sources, and, industrial, gauges, several, unusual, applications, such, as, nuclear, batteries, or, fuel, for, space, ships, with, nuclear, propulsion, have, been, proposed, for, the, isotope, 242m, am, but, they, are, as, yet, hindered, by, the, scarcity, and, high, price, of, this, nuclear, isomer, americium, is, a, relatively, soft, radioactive, metal, with, silvery, appearance, its, most, common, isotopes, are, 241, am, and, 243, am, in, chemical, compounds, americium, usually, assumes, the, oxidation, state, 3, especially, in, solutions, several, other, oxidation, states, are, known, ranging, from, 2, to, 7, and, can, be, identified, by, their, characteristic, optical, absorption, spectra, the, crystal, lattices, of, solid, americium, and, its, compounds, contain, small, intrinsic, radiogenic, defects, due, to, metamictization, induced, by, self, irradiation, with, alpha, particles, which, accumulates, with, time, this, can, cause, a, drift, of, some, material, properties, over, time, more, noticeable, in, older, samples, although, americium, was, likely, produced, in, previous, nuclear, experiments, it, was, first, intentionally, synthesized, isolated, and, identified, in, late, autumn, 1944, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, by, glenn, t, seaborg, leon, o, morgan, ralph, a, james, and, albert, ghiorso, they, used, a, 60, inch, cyclotron, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, the, element, was, chemically, identified, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, now, argonne, national, laboratory, of, the, university, of, chicago, following, the, lighter, neptunium, plutonium, and, heavier, curium, americium, was, the, fourth, transuranium, element, to, be, discovered, at, the, time, the, periodic, table, had, been, restructured, by, seaborg, to, its, present, layout, containing, the, actinide, row, below, the, lanthanide, one, this, led, to, americium, being, located, right, below, its, twin, lanthanide, element, europium, it, was, thus, by, analogy, named, after, the, americas, the, name, americium, after, the, americas, and, the, symbol, am, are, suggested, for, the, element, on, the, basis, of, its, position, as, the, sixth, member, of, the, actinide, rare, earth, series, analogous, to, europium, eu, of, the, lanthanide, series, the, new, element, was, isolated, from, its, oxides, in, a, complex, multi, step, process, first, plutonium, 239, nitrate, 239, puno, 3, solution, was, coated, on, a, platinum, foil, of, about, 0, 5, cm, 2, area, the, solution, was, evaporated, and, the, residue, was, converted, into, plutonium, dioxide, puo, 2, by, calcining, after, cyclotron, irradiation, the, coating, was, dissolved, with, nitric, acid, and, then, precipitated, as, the, hydroxide, using, concentrated, aqueous, ammonia, solution, the, residue, was, dissolved, in, perchloric, acid, further, separation, was, carried, out, by, ion, exchange, yielding, a, certain, isotope, of, curium, the, separation, of, curium, and, americium, was, so, painstaking, that, those, elements, were, initially, called, by, the, berkeley, group, as, pandemonium, from, greek, for, all, demons, or, hell, and, delirium, from, latin, for, madness, initial, experiments, yielded, four, americium, isotopes, 241, am, 242, am, 239, am, and, 238, am, americium, 241, was, directly, obtained, from, plutonium, upon, absorption, of, two, neutrons, it, decays, by, emission, of, a, particle, to, 237, np, the, half, life, of, this, decay, was, first, determined, as, 510, 20, years, but, then, corrected, to, 432, 2, years, the, second, isotope, 242, am, was, produced, upon, neutron, bombardment, of, the, already, created, 241, am, upon, rapid, decay, 242, am, converts, into, the, isotope, of, curium, 242, cm, which, had, been, discovered, previously, the, half, life, of, this, decay, was, initially, determined, at, 17, hours, which, was, close, to, the, presently, accepted, value, of, 16, 02, h, the, discovery, of, americium, and, curium, in, 1944, was, closely, related, to, the, manhattan, project, the, results, were, confidential, and, declassified, only, in, 1945, seaborg, leaked, the, synthesis, of, the, elements, 95, and, 96, on, the, u, s, radio, show, for, children, quiz, kids, five, days, before, the, official, presentation, at, an, american, chemical, society, meeting, on, 11, november, 1945, when, one, of, the, listeners, asked, whether, any, new, transuranium, element, besides, plutonium, and, neptunium, had, been, discovered, during, the, war, after, the, discovery, of, americium, isotopes, 241, am, and, 242, am, their, production, and, compounds, were, patented, listing, only, seaborg, as, the, inventor, the, initial, americium, samples, weighed, a, few, micrograms, they, were, barely, visible, and, were, identified, by, their, radioactivity, the, first, substantial, amounts, of, metallic, americium, weighing, 40, 200, micrograms, were, not, prepared, until, 1951, by, reduction, of, americium, iii, fluoride, with, barium, metal, in, high, vacuum, at, 1100, c, the, longest, lived, and, most, common, isotopes, of, americium, 241, am, and, 243, am, have, half, lives, of, 432, 2, and, 7, 370, years, respectively, therefore, any, primordial, americium, americium, that, was, present, on, earth, during, its, formation, should, have, decayed, by, now, trace, amounts, of, americium, probably, occur, naturally, in, uranium, minerals, as, a, result, of, neutron, capture, and, beta, decay, 238, u, 239, pu, 240, pu, 241, am, though, the, quantities, would, be, tiny, and, this, has, not, been, confirmed, extraterrestrial, long, lived, 247, cm, is, probably, also, deposited, on, earth, and, has, 243, am, as, one, of, its, intermediate, decay, products, but, again, this, has, not, been, confirmed, existing, americium, is, concentrated, in, the, areas, used, for, the, atmospheric, nuclear, weapons, tests, conducted, between, 1945, and, 1980, as, well, as, at, the, sites, of, nuclear, incidents, such, as, the, chernobyl, disaster, for, example, the, analysis, of, the, debris, at, the, testing, site, of, the, first, u, s, hydrogen, bomb, ivy, mike, 1, november, 1952, enewetak, atoll, revealed, high, concentrations, of, various, actinides, including, americium, but, due, to, military, secrecy, this, result, was, not, published, until, later, in, 1956, trinitite, the, glassy, residue, left, on, the, desert, floor, near, alamogordo, new, mexico, after, the, plutonium, based, trinity, nuclear, bomb, test, on, 16, july, 1945, contains, traces, of, americium, 241, elevated, levels, of, americium, were, also, detected, at, the, crash, site, of, a, us, boeing, b, 52, bomber, aircraft, which, carried, four, hydrogen, bombs, in, 1968, in, greenland, in, other, regions, the, average, radioactivity, of, surface, soil, due, to, residual, americium, is, only, about, 0, 01, picocuries, per, gram, 0, 37, mbq, g, atmospheric, americium, compounds, are, poorly, soluble, in, common, solvents, and, mostly, adhere, to, soil, particles, soil, analysis, revealed, about, 1, 900, times, higher, concentration, of, americium, inside, sandy, soil, particles, than, in, the, water, present, in, the, soil, pores, an, even, higher, ratio, was, measured, in, loam, soils, americium, is, produced, mostly, artificially, in, small, quantities, for, research, purposes, a, tonne, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, contains, about, 100, grams, of, various, americium, isotopes, mostly, 241, am, and, 243, am, their, prolonged, radioactivity, is, undesirable, for, the, disposal, and, therefore, americium, together, with, other, long, lived, actinides, must, be, neutralized, the, associated, procedure, may, involve, several, steps, where, americium, is, first, separated, and, then, converted, by, neutron, bombardment, in, special, reactors, to, short, lived, nuclides, this, procedure, is, well, known, as, nuclear, transmutation, but, it, is, still, being, developed, for, americium, the, transuranic, elements, from, americium, to, fermium, occurred, naturally, in, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, at, oklo, but, no, longer, do, so, americium, is, also, one, of, the, elements, that, have, theoretically, been, detected, in, przybylski, s, star, americium, has, been, produced, in, small, quantities, in, nuclear, reactors, for, decades, and, kilograms, of, its, 241, am, and, 243, am, isotopes, have, been, accumulated, by, now, nevertheless, since, it, was, first, offered, for, sale, in, 1962, its, price, about, us, 1, 500, per, gram, us, 43, 000, oz, of, 241, am, remains, almost, unchanged, owing, to, the, very, complex, separation, procedure, the, heavier, isotope, 243, am, is, produced, in, much, smaller, amounts, it, is, thus, more, difficult, to, separate, resulting, in, a, higher, cost, of, the, order, us, 100, 000, us, 160, 000, per, gram, us, 2, 800, 000, us, 4, 500, 000, oz, americium, is, not, synthesized, directly, from, uranium, the, most, common, reactor, material, but, from, the, plutonium, isotope, 239, pu, the, latter, needs, to, be, produced, first, according, to, the, following, nuclear, process, the, capture, of, two, neutrons, by, 239, pu, a, so, called, n, reaction, followed, by, a, decay, results, in, 241, am, the, plutonium, present, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, contains, about, 12, of, 241, pu, because, it, beta, decays, to, 241, am, 241, pu, can, be, extracted, and, may, be, used, to, generate, further, 241, am, however, this, process, is, rather, slow, half, of, the, original, amount, of, 241, pu, decays, to, 241, am, after, about, 15, years, and, the, 241, am, amount, reaches, a, maximum, after, 70, years, the, obtained, 241, am, can, be, used, for, generating, heavier, americium, isotopes, by, further, neutron, capture, inside, a, nuclear, reactor, in, a, light, water, reactor, lwr, 79, of, 241, am, converts, to, 242, am, and, 10, to, its, nuclear, isomer, 242m, am, americium, 242, has, a, half, life, of, only, 16, hours, which, makes, its, further, conversion, to, 243, am, extremely, inefficient, the, latter, isotope, is, produced, instead, in, a, process, where, 239, pu, captures, four, neutrons, under, high, neutron, flux, most, synthesis, routines, yield, a, mixture, of, different, actinide, isotopes, in, oxide, forms, from, which, isotopes, of, americium, can, be, separated, in, a, typical, procedure, the, spent, reactor, fuel, e, g, mox, fuel, is, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, and, the, bulk, of, uranium, and, plutonium, is, removed, using, a, purex, type, extraction, p, lutonium, ur, anium, ex, traction, with, tributyl, phosphate, in, a, hydrocarbon, the, lanthanides, and, remaining, actinides, are, then, separated, from, the, aqueous, residue, raffinate, by, a, diamide, based, extraction, to, give, after, stripping, a, mixture, of, trivalent, actinides, and, lanthanides, americium, compounds, are, then, selectively, extracted, using, multi, step, chromatographic, and, centrifugation, techniques, with, an, appropriate, reagent, a, large, amount, of, work, has, been, done, on, the, solvent, extraction, of, americium, for, example, a, 2003, eu, funded, project, codenamed, europart, studied, triazines, and, other, compounds, as, potential, extraction, agents, a, bis, triazinyl, bipyridine, complex, was, proposed, in, 2009, as, such, a, reagent, is, highly, selective, to, americium, and, curium, separation, of, americium, from, the, highly, similar, curium, can, be, achieved, by, treating, a, slurry, of, their, hydroxides, in, aqueous, sodium, bicarbonate, with, ozone, at, elevated, temperatures, both, am, and, cm, are, mostly, present, in, solutions, in, the, 3, valence, state, whereas, curium, remains, unchanged, americium, oxidizes, to, soluble, am, iv, complexes, which, can, be, washed, away, metallic, americium, is, obtained, by, reduction, from, its, compounds, americium, iii, fluoride, was, first, used, for, this, purpose, the, reaction, was, conducted, using, elemental, barium, as, reducing, agent, in, a, water, and, oxygen, free, environment, inside, an, apparatus, made, of, tantalum, and, tungsten, an, alternative, is, the, reduction, of, americium, dioxide, by, metallic, lanthanum, or, thorium, in, the, periodic, table, americium, is, located, to, the, right, of, plutonium, to, the, left, of, curium, and, below, the, lanthanide, europium, with, which, it, shares, many, physical, and, chemical, properties, americium, is, a, highly, radioactive, element, when, freshly, prepared, it, has, a, silvery, white, metallic, lustre, but, then, slowly, tarnishes, in, air, with, a, density, of, 12, g, cm, 3, americium, is, less, dense, than, both, curium, 13, 52, g, cm, 3, and, plutonium, 19, 8, g, cm, 3, but, has, a, higher, density, than, europium, 5, 264, g, cm, 3, mostly, because, of, its, higher, atomic, mass, americium, is, relatively, soft, and, easily, deformable, and, has, a, significantly, lower, bulk, modulus, than, the, actinides, before, it, th, pa, u, np, and, pu, its, melting, point, of, 1173, c, is, significantly, higher, than, that, of, plutonium, 639, c, and, europium, 826, c, but, lower, than, for, curium, 1340, c, at, ambient, conditions, americium, is, present, in, its, most, stable, form, which, has, a, hexagonal, crystal, symmetry, and, a, space, group, p6, 3, mmc, with, cell, parameters, a, 346, 8, pm, and, c, 1124, pm, and, four, atoms, per, unit, cell, the, crystal, consists, of, a, double, hexagonal, close, packing, with, the, layer, sequence, abac, and, so, is, isotypic, with, lanthanum, and, several, actinides, such, as, curium, the, crystal, structure, of, americium, changes, with, pressure, and, temperature, when, compressed, at, room, temperature, to, 5, gpa, am, transforms, to, the, modification, which, has, a, face, centered, cubic, fcc, symmetry, space, group, fm, 3, m, and, lattice, constant, a, 489, pm, this, fcc, structure, is, equivalent, to, the, closest, packing, with, the, sequence, abc, upon, further, compression, to, 23, gpa, americium, transforms, to, an, orthorhombic, am, structure, similar, to, that, of, uranium, there, are, no, further, transitions, observed, up, to, 52, gpa, except, for, an, appearance, of, a, monoclinic, phase, at, pressures, between, 10, and, 15, gpa, there, is, no, consistency, on, the, status, of, this, phase, in, the, literature, which, also, sometimes, lists, the, and, phases, as, i, ii, and, iii, the, transition, is, accompanied, by, a, 6, decrease, in, the, crystal, volume, although, theory, also, predicts, a, significant, volume, change, for, the, transition, it, is, not, observed, experimentally, the, pressure, of, the, transition, decreases, with, increasing, temperature, and, when, americium, is, heated, at, ambient, pressure, at, 770, c, it, changes, into, an, fcc, phase, which, is, different, from, am, and, at, 1075, c, it, converts, to, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, the, pressure, temperature, phase, diagram, of, americium, is, thus, rather, similar, to, those, of, lanthanum, praseodymium, and, neodymium, as, with, many, other, actinides, self, damage, of, the, crystal, structure, due, to, alpha, particle, irradiation, is, intrinsic, to, americium, it, is, especially, noticeable, at, low, temperatures, where, the, mobility, of, the, produced, structure, defects, is, relatively, low, by, broadening, of, x, ray, diffraction, peaks, this, effect, makes, somewhat, uncertain, the, temperature, of, americium, and, some, of, its, properties, such, as, electrical, resistivity, so, for, americium, 241, the, resistivity, at, 4, 2, k, increases, with, time, from, about, 2, ohm, cm, to, 10, ohm, cm, after, 40, hours, and, saturates, at, about, 16, ohm, cm, after, 140, hours, this, effect, is, less, pronounced, at, room, temperature, due, to, annihilation, of, radiation, defects, also, heating, to, room, temperature, the, sample, which, was, kept, for, hours, at, low, temperatures, restores, its, resistivity, in, fresh, samples, the, resistivity, gradually, increases, with, temperature, from, about, 2, ohm, cm, at, liquid, helium, to, 69, ohm, cm, at, room, temperature, this, behavior, is, similar, to, that, of, neptunium, uranium, thorium, and, protactinium, but, is, different, from, plutonium, and, curium, which, show, a, rapid, rise, up, to, 60, k, followed, by, saturation, the, room, temperature, value, for, americium, is, lower, than, that, of, neptunium, plutonium, and, curium, but, higher, than, for, uranium, thorium, and, protactinium, americium, is, paramagnetic, in, a, wide, temperature, range, from, that, of, liquid, helium, to, room, temperature, and, above, this, behavior, is, markedly, different, from, that, of, its, neighbor, curium, which, exhibits, antiferromagnetic, transition, at, 52, k, the, thermal, expansion, coefficient, of, americium, is, slightly, anisotropic, and, amounts, to, 7, 5, 0, 2, 10, 6, c, along, the, shorter, a, axis, and, 6, 2, 0, 4, 10, 6, c, for, the, longer, c, hexagonal, axis, the, enthalpy, of, dissolution, of, americium, metal, in, hydrochloric, acid, at, standard, conditions, is, 620, 6, 1, 3, kj, mol, from, which, the, standard, enthalpy, change, of, formation, f, h, of, aqueous, am, 3, ion, is, 621, 2, 2, 0, kj, mol, the, standard, potential, am, 3, am, 0, is, 2, 08, 0, 01, v, americium, metal, readily, reacts, with, oxygen, and, dissolves, in, aqueous, acids, the, most, stable, oxidation, state, for, americium, is, 3, the, chemistry, of, americium, iii, has, many, similarities, to, the, chemistry, of, lanthanide, iii, compounds, for, example, trivalent, americium, forms, insoluble, fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate, and, other, salts, compounds, of, americium, in, oxidation, states, 2, 4, 5, 6, and, 7, have, also, been, studied, this, is, the, widest, range, that, has, been, observed, with, actinide, elements, the, color, of, americium, compounds, in, aqueous, solution, is, as, follows, am, 3, yellow, reddish, am, 4, yellow, reddish, am, v, o, 2, yellow, am, vi, o, 2, 2, brown, and, am, vii, o, 5, 6, dark, green, the, absorption, spectra, have, sharp, peaks, due, to, f, f, transitions, in, the, visible, and, near, infrared, regions, typically, am, iii, has, absorption, maxima, at, ca, 504, and, 811, nm, am, v, at, ca, 514, and, 715, nm, and, am, vi, at, ca, 666, and, 992, nm, americium, compounds, with, oxidation, state, 4, and, higher, are, strong, oxidizing, agents, comparable, in, strength, to, the, permanganate, ion, mno, 4, in, acidic, solutions, whereas, the, am, 4, ions, are, unstable, in, solutions, and, readily, convert, to, am, 3, compounds, such, as, americium, dioxide, amo, 2, and, americium, iv, fluoride, amf, 4, are, stable, in, the, solid, state, the, pentavalent, oxidation, state, of, americium, was, first, observed, in, 1951, in, acidic, aqueous, solution, the, amo, 2, ion, is, unstable, with, respect, to, disproportionation, the, reaction, is, typical, the, chemistry, of, am, v, and, am, vi, is, comparable, to, the, chemistry, of, uranium, in, those, oxidation, states, in, particular, compounds, like, li, 3, amo, 4, and, li, 6, amo, 6, are, comparable, to, uranates, and, the, ion, amo, 2, 2, is, comparable, to, the, uranyl, ion, uo, 2, 2, such, compounds, can, be, prepared, by, oxidation, of, am, iii, in, dilute, nitric, acid, with, ammonium, persulfate, other, oxidising, agents, that, have, been, used, include, silver, i, oxide, ozone, and, sodium, persulfate, three, americium, oxides, are, known, with, the, oxidation, states, 2, amo, 3, am, 2, o, 3, and, 4, amo, 2, americium, ii, oxide, was, prepared, in, minute, amounts, and, has, not, been, characterized, in, detail, americium, iii, oxide, is, a, red, brown, solid, with, a, melting, point, of, 2205, c, americium, iv, oxide, is, the, main, form, of, solid, americium, which, is, used, in, nearly, all, its, applications, as, most, other, actinide, dioxides, it, is, a, black, solid, with, a, cubic, fluorite, crystal, structure, the, oxalate, of, americium, iii, vacuum, dried, at, room, temperature, has, the, chemical, formula, am, 2, c, 2, o, 4, 3, 7h, 2, o, upon, heating, in, vacuum, it, loses, water, at, 240, c, and, starts, decomposing, into, amo, 2, at, 300, c, the, decomposition, completes, at, about, 470, c, the, initial, oxalate, dissolves, in, nitric, acid, with, the, maximum, solubility, of, 0, 25, g, l, halides, of, americium, are, known, for, the, oxidation, states, 2, 3, and, 4, where, the, 3, is, most, stable, especially, in, solutions, reduction, of, am, iii, compounds, with, sodium, amalgam, yields, am, ii, salts, the, black, halides, amcl, 2, ambr, 2, and, ami, 2, they, are, very, sensitive, to, oxygen, and, oxidize, in, water, releasing, hydrogen, and, converting, back, to, the, am, iii, state, specific, lattice, constants, are, americium, iii, fluoride, amf, 3, is, poorly, soluble, and, precipitates, upon, reaction, of, am, 3, and, fluoride, ions, in, weak, acidic, solutions, the, tetravalent, americium, iv, fluoride, amf, 4, is, obtained, by, reacting, solid, americium, iii,

this, purpose, black, am, oh, 4, was, dissolved, in, 15, m, nh, 4, f, with, the, americium, concentration, of, 0, 01, m, the, resulting, reddish, solution, had, a, characteristic, optical, absorption, spectrum, which, is, similar, to, that, of, amf, 4, but, differed, from, other, oxidation, states, of, americium, heating, the, am, iv, solution, to, 90, c, did, not, result, in, its, disproportionation, or, reduction, however, a, slow, reduction, was, observed, to, am, iii, and, assigned, to, self, irradiation, of, americium, by, alpha, particles, most, americium, iii, halides,

sb, 2, o, 3, and, amocl, can, also, be, produced, by, vapor, phase, hydrolysis, the, known, chalcogenides, of, americium, include, the, sulfide, ams, 2, selenides, amse, 2, and, am, 3, se, 4, and, tellurides, am, 2, te, 3, and, amte, 2, the, pnictides, of, americium, 243, am, of, the, amx, type, are, known, for, the, elements, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, they, crystallize, in, the, rock, salt, lattice, americium, monosilicide, amsi, and, disilicide, nominally, amsi, x, with, 1, 87, x, 2, 0, were, obtained, by, reduction, of, americium, iii, fluoride, with, elementary, silicon, in, vacuum, at, 1050, c, amsi, and, 1150, 1200, c, amsi, x, amsi, is, a, black, solid, isomorphic, with, lasi, it, has, an, orthorhombic, crystal, symmetry, amsi, x, has, a, bright, silvery, lustre, and, a, tetragonal, crystal, lattice, space, group, i, 4, 1, amd, it, is, isomorphic, with, pusi, 2, and, thsi, 2, borides, of, americium, include, amb, 4, and, amb, 6, the, tetraboride, can, be, obtained, by, heating, an, oxide, or, halide, of, americium, with, magnesium, diboride, in, vacuum, or, inert, atmosphere, analogous, to, uranocene, americium, forms, the, organometallic, compound, amerocene, with, two, cyclooctatetraene, ligands, with, the, chemical, formula, 8, c, 8, h, 8, 2, am, a, cyclopentadienyl, complex, is, also, known, that, is, likely, to, be, stoichiometrically, amcp, 3, formation, of, the, complexes, of, the, type, am, n, c, 3, h, 7, btp, 3, where, btp, stands, for, 2, 6, di, 1, 2, 4, triazin, 3, yl, pyridine, in, solutions, containing, n, c, 3, h, 7, btp, and, am, 3, ions, has, been, confirmed, by, exafs, some, of, these, btp, type, complexes, selectively, interact, with, americium, and, therefore, are, useful, in, its, selective, separation, from, lanthanides, and, another, actinides, americium, is, an, artificial, element, of, recent, origin, and, thus, does, not, have, a, biological, requirement, it, is, harmful, to, life, it, has, been, proposed, to, use, bacteria, for, removal, of, americium, and, other, heavy, metals, from, rivers, and, streams, thus, enterobacteriaceae, of, the, genus, citrobacter, precipitate, americium, ions, from, aqueous, solutions, binding, them, into, a, metal, phosphate, complex, at, their, cell, walls, several, studies, have, been, reported, on, the, biosorption, and, bioaccumulation, of, americium, by, bacteria, and, fungi, the, isotope, 242m, am, half, life, 141, years, has, the, largest, cross, sections, for, absorption, of, thermal, neutrons, 5, 700, barns, that, results, in, a, small, critical, mass, for, a, sustained, nuclear, chain, reaction, the, critical, mass, for, a, bare, 242m, am, sphere, is, about, 9, 14, kg, the, uncertainty, results, from, insufficient, knowledge, of, its, material, properties, it, can, be, lowered, to, 3, 5, kg, with, a, metal, reflector, and, should, become, even, smaller, with, a, water, reflector, such, small, critical, mass, is, favorable, for, portable, nuclear, weapons, but, those, based, on, 242m, am, are, not, known, yet, probably, because, of, its, scarcity, and, high, price, the, critical, masses, of, the, two, readily, available, isotopes, 241, am, and, 243, am, are, relatively, high, 57, 6, to, 75, 6, kg, for, 241, am, and, 209, kg, for, 243, am, scarcity, and, high, price, yet, hinder, application, of, americium, as, a, nuclear, fuel, in, nuclear, reactors, there, are, proposals, of, very, compact, 10, kw, high, flux, reactors, using, as, little, as, 20, grams, of, 242m, am, such, low, power, reactors, would, be, relatively, safe, to, use, as, neutron, sources, for, radiation, therapy, in, hospitals, about, 18, isotopes, and, 11, nuclear, isomers, are, known, for, americium, having, mass, numbers, 229, 230, and, 232, through, 247, there, are, two, long, lived, alpha, emitters, 243, am, has, a, half, life, of, 7, 370, years, and, is, the, most, stable, isotope, and, 241, am, has, a, half, life, of, 432, 2, years, the, most, stable, nuclear, isomer, is, 242m1, am, it, has, a, long, half, life, of, 141, years, the, half, lives, of, other, isotopes, and, isomers, range, from, 0, 64, microseconds, for, 245m1, am, to, 50, 8, hours, for, 240, am, as, with, most, other, actinides, the, isotopes, of, americium, with, odd, number, of, neutrons, have, relatively, high, rate, of, nuclear, fission, and, low, critical, mass, americium, 241, decays, to, 237, np, emitting, alpha, particles, of, 5, different, energies, mostly, at, 5, 486, mev, 85, 2, and, 5, 443, mev, 12, 8, because, many, of, the, resulting, states, are, metastable, they, also, emit, gamma, rays, with, the, discrete, energies, between, 26, 3, and, 158, 5, kev, americium, 242, is, a, short, lived, isotope, with, a, half, life, of, 16, 02, h, it, mostly, 82, 7, converts, by, decay, to, 242, cm, but, also, by, electron, capture, to, 242, pu, 17, 3, both, 242, cm, and, 242, pu, transform, via, nearly, the, same, decay, chain, through, 238, pu, down, to, 234, u, nearly, all, 99, 541, of, 242m1, am, decays, by, internal, conversion, to, 242, am, and, the, remaining, 0, 459, by, decay, to, 238, np, the, latter, subsequently, decays, to, 238, pu, and, then, to, 234, u, americium, 243, transforms, by, emission, into, 239, np, which, converts, by, decay, to, 239, pu, and, the, 239, pu, changes, into, 235, u, by, emitting, an, particle, americium, is, used, in, the, most, common, type, of, household, smoke, detector, which, uses, 241, am, in, the, form, of, americium, dioxide, as, its, source, of, ionizing, radiation, this, isotope, is, preferred, over, 226, ra, because, it, emits, 5, times, more, alpha, particles, and, relatively, little, harmful, gamma, radiation, the, amount, of, americium, in, a, typical, new, smoke, detector, is, 1, microcurie, 37, kbq, or, 0, 29, microgram, this, amount, declines, slowly, as, the, americium, decays, into, neptunium, 237, a, different, transuranic, element, with, a, much, longer, half, life, about, 2, 14, million, years, with, its, half, life, of, 432, 2, years, the, americium, in, a, smoke, detector, includes, about, 3, neptunium, after, 19, years, and, about, 5, after, 32, years, the, radiation, passes, through, an, ionization, chamber, an, air, filled, space, between, two, electrodes, and, permits, a, small, constant, current, between, the, electrodes, any, smoke, that, enters, the, chamber, absorbs, the, alpha, particles, which, reduces, the, ionization, and, affects, this, current, triggering, the, alarm, compared, to, the, alternative, optical, smoke, detector, the, ionization, smoke, detector, is, cheaper, and, can, detect, particles, which, are, too, small, to, produce, significant, light, scattering, however, it, is, more, prone, to, false, alarms, as, 241, am, has, a, roughly, similar, half, life, to, 238, pu, 432, 2, years, vs, 87, years, it, has, been, proposed, as, an, active, element, of, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, for, example, in, spacecraft, although, americium, produces, less, heat, and, electricity, the, power, yield, is, 114, 7, mw, g, for, 241, am, and, 6, 31, mw, g, for, 243, am, cf, 390, mw, g, for, 238, pu, and, its, radiation, poses, more, threat, to, humans, owing, to, neutron, emission, the, european, space, agency, is, considering, using, americium, for, its, space, probes, another, proposed, space, related, application, of, americium, is, a, fuel, for, space, ships, with, nuclear, propulsion, it, relies, on, the, very, high, rate, of, nuclear, fission, of, 242m, am, which, can, be, maintained, even, in, a, micrometer, thick, foil, small, thickness, avoids, the, problem, of, self, absorption, of, emitted, radiation, this, problem, is, pertinent, to, uranium, or, plutonium, rods, in, which, only, surface, layers, provide, alpha, particles, the, fission, products, of, 242m, am, can, either, directly, propel, the, spaceship, or, they, can, heat, a, thrusting, gas, they, can, also, transfer, their, energy, to, a, fluid, and, generate, electricity, through, a, magnetohydrodynamic, generator, one, more, proposal, which, utilizes, the, high, nuclear, fission, rate, of, 242m, am, is, a, nuclear, battery, its, design, relies, not, on, the, energy, of, the, emitted, by, americium, alpha, particles, but, on, their, charge, that, is, the, americium, acts, as, the, self, sustaining, cathode, a, single, 3, 2, kg, 242m, am, charge, of, such, battery, could, provide, about, 140, kw, of, power, over, a, period, of, 80, days, even, with, all, the, potential, benefits, the, current, applications, of, 242m, am, are, as, yet, hindered, by, the, scarcity, and, high, price, of, this, particular, nuclear, isomer, in, 2019, researchers, at, the, uk, national, nuclear, laboratory, and, the, university, of, leicester, demonstrated, the, use, of, heat, generated, by, americium, to, illuminate, a, small, light, bulb, this, technology, could, lead, to, systems, to, power, missions, with, durations, up, to, 400, years, into, interstellar, space, where, solar, panels, do, not, function, the, oxide, of, 241, am, pressed, with, beryllium, is, an, efficient, neutron, source, here, americium, acts, as, the, alpha, source, and, beryllium, produces, neutrons, owing, to, its, large, cross, section, for, the, n, nuclear, reaction, the, most, widespread, use, of, 241, ambe, neutron, sources, is, a, neutron, probe, a, device, used, to, measure, the, quantity, of, water, present, in, soil, as, well, as, moisture, density, for, quality, control, in, highway, construction, 241, am, neutron, sources, are, also, used, in, well, logging, applications, as, well, as, in, neutron, radiography, tomography, and, other, radiochemical, investigations, americium, is, a, starting, material, for, the, production, of, other, transuranic, elements, and, transactinides, for, example, 82, 7, of, 242, am, decays, to, 242, cm, and, 17, 3, to, 242, pu, in, the, nuclear, reactor, 242, am, is, also, up, converted, by, neutron, capture, to, 243, am, and, 244, am, which, transforms, by, decay, to, 244, cm, irradiation, of, 241, am, by, 12, c, or, 22, ne, ions, yields, the, isotopes, 247, es, einsteinium, or, 260, db, dubnium, respectively, furthermore, the, element, berkelium, 243, bk, isotope, had, been, first, intentionally, produced, and, identified, by, bombarding, 241, am, with, alpha, particles, in, 1949, by, the, same, berkeley, group, using, the, same, 60, inch, cyclotron, similarly, nobelium, was, produced, at, the, joint, institute, for, nuclear, research, dubna, russia, in, 1965, in, several, reactions, one, of, which, included, irradiation, of, 243, am, with, 15, n, ions, besides, one, of, the, synthesis, reactions, for, lawrencium, discovered, by, scientists, at, berkeley, and, dubna, included, bombardment, of, 243, am, with, 18, o, americium, 241, has, been, used, as, a, portable, source, of, both, gamma, rays, and, alpha, particles, for, a, number, of, medical, and, industrial, uses, the, 59, 5409, kev, gamma, ray, emissions, from, 241, am, in, such, sources, can, be, used, for, indirect, analysis, of, materials, in, radiography, and, x, ray, fluorescence, spectroscopy, as, well, as, for, quality, control, in, fixed, nuclear, density, gauges, and, nuclear, densometers, for, example, the, element, has, been, employed, to, gauge, glass, thickness, to, help, create, flat, glass, americium, 241, is, also, suitable, for, calibration, of, gamma, ray, spectrometers, in, the, low, energy, range, since, its, spectrum, consists, of, nearly, a, single, peak, and, negligible, compton, continuum, at, least, three, orders, of, magnitude, lower, intensity, americium, 241, gamma, rays, were, also, used, to, provide, passive, diagnosis, of, thyroid, function, this, medical, application, is, however, obsolete, as, a, highly, radioactive, element, americium, and, its, compounds, must, be, handled, only, in, an, appropriate, laboratory, under, special, arrangements, although, most, americium, isotopes, predominantly, emit, alpha, particles, which, can, be, blocked, by, thin, layers, of, common, materials, many, of, the, daughter, products, emit, gamma, rays, and, neutrons, which, have, a, long, penetration, depth, if, consumed, most, of, the, americium, is, excreted, within, a, few, days, with, only, 0, 05, absorbed, in, the, blood, of, which, roughly, 45, goes, to, the, liver, and, 45, to, the, bones, and, the, remaining, 10, is, excreted, the, uptake, to, the, liver, depends, on, the, individual, and, increases, with, age, in, the, bones, americium, is, first, deposited, over, cortical, and, trabecular, surfaces, and, slowly, redistributes, over, the, bone, with, time, the, biological, half, life, of, 241, am, is, 50, years, in, the, bones, and, 20, years, in, the, liver, whereas, in, the, gonads, testicles, and, ovaries, it, remains, permanently, in, all, these, organs, americium, promotes, formation, of, cancer, cells, as, a, result, of, its, radioactivity, americium, often, enters, landfills, from, discarded, smoke, detectors, the, rules, associated, with, the, disposal, of, smoke, detectors, are, relaxed, in, most, jurisdictions, in, 1994, 17, year, old, david, hahn, extracted, the, americium, from, about, 100, smoke, detectors, in, an, attempt, to, build, a, breeder, nuclear, reactor, there, have, been, a, few, cases, of, exposure, to, americium, the, worst, case, being, that, of, chemical, operations, technician, harold, mccluskey, who, at, the, age, of, 64, was, exposed, to, 500, times, the, occupational, standard, for, americium, 241, as, a, result, of, an, explosion, in, his, lab, mccluskey, died, at, the, age, of, 75, of, unrelated, pre, existing, disease
