the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, lome, sometimes, known, as, the, end, ordovician, mass, extinction, or, the, ordovician, silurian, extinction, is, the, first, of, the, big, five, major, mass, extinction, events, in, earth, s, history, occurring, roughly, 445, million, years, ago, ma, it, is, often, considered, to, be, the, second, largest, known, extinction, event, just, behind, the, end, permian, mass, extinction, in, terms, of, the, percentage, of, genera, that, became, extinct, extinction, was, global, during, this, interval, eliminating, 49, 60, of, marine, genera, and, nearly, 85, of, marine, species, under, most, tabulations, only, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, exceeds, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, in, biodiversity, loss, the, extinction, event, abruptly, affected, all, major, taxonomic, groups, and, caused, the, disappearance, of, one, third, of, all, brachiopod, and, bryozoan, families, as, well, as, numerous, groups, of, conodonts, trilobites, echinoderms, corals, bivalves, and, graptolites, despite, its, taxonomic, severity, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, did, not, produce, major, changes, to, ecosystem, structures, compared, to, other, mass, extinctions, nor, did, it, lead, to, any, particular, morphological, innovations, diversity, gradually, recovered, to, pre, extinction, levels, over, the, first, 5, million, years, of, the, silurian, period, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, is, traditionally, considered, to, occur, in, two, distinct, pulses, the, first, pulse, interval, known, as, lomei, 1, began, at, the, boundary, between, the, katian, and, hirnantian, stages, of, the, late, ordovician, epoch, this, extinction, pulse, is, typically, attributed, to, the, late, ordovician, glaciation, which, abruptly, expanded, over, gondwana, at, the, beginning, of, the, hirnantian, and, shifted, the, earth, from, a, greenhouse, to, icehouse, climate, cooling, and, a, falling, sea, level, brought, on, by, the, glaciation, led, to, habitat, loss, for, many, organisms, along, the, continental, shelves, especially, endemic, taxa, with, restricted, temperature, tolerance, and, latitudinal, range, during, this, extinction, pulse, there, were, also, several, marked, changes, in, biologically, responsive, carbon, and, oxygen, isotopes, marine, life, partially, rediversified, during, the, cold, period, and, a, new, cold, water, ecosystem, the, hirnantia, fauna, was, established, the, second, pulse, interval, of, extinction, referred, to, as, lomei, 2, occurred, in, the, later, half, of, the, hirnantian, as, the, glaciation, abruptly, receded, and, warm, conditions, returned, the, second, pulse, was, associated, with, intense, worldwide, anoxia, oxygen, depletion, and, euxinia, toxic, sulfide, production, which, persisted, into, the, subsequent, rhuddanian, stage, of, the, silurian, period, some, researchers, have, proposed, the, existence, of, a, third, distinct, pulse, of, the, mass, extinction, during, the, early, rhuddanian, evidenced, by, a, negative, carbon, isotope, excursion, and, a, pulse, of, anoxia, into, shelf, environments, amidst, already, low, background, oxygen, levels, others, however, have, argued, that, rhuddanian, anoxia, was, simply, part, of, the, second, pulse, which, according, to, this, view, was, longer, and, more, drawn, out, than, most, authors, suggest, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, followed, the, great, ordovician, biodiversification, event, gobe, one, of, the, largest, surges, of, increasing, biodiversity, in, the, geological, and, biological, history, of, the, earth, at, the, time, of, the, extinction, most, complex, multicellular, organisms, lived, in, the, sea, and, the, only, evidence, of, life, on, land, are, rare, spores, from, small, early, land, plants, at, the, time, of, the, extinction, around, 100, marine, families, became, extinct, covering, about, 49, of, genera, a, more, reliable, estimate, than, species, the, brachiopods, and, bryozoans, were, strongly, impacted, along, with, many, of, the, trilobite, conodont, and, graptolite, families, the, extinction, was, divided, into, two, major, extinction, pulses, the, first, pulse, occurred, at, the, base, of, the, global, metabolograptus, extraordinarius, graptolite, biozone, which, marks, the, end, of, the, katian, stage, and, the, start, of, the, hirnantian, stage, the, second, pulse, of, extinction, occurred, in, the, later, part, of, the, hirnantian, stage, coinciding, with, the, metabolograptus, persculptus, zone, each, extinction, pulse, affected, different, groups, of, animals, and, was, followed, by, a, rediversification, event, statistical, analysis, of, marine, losses, at, this, time, suggests, that, the, decrease, in, diversity, was, mainly, caused, by, a, sharp, increase, in, extinctions, rather, than, a, decrease, in, speciation, following, such, a, major, loss, of, diversity, silurian, communities, were, initially, less, complex, and, broader, niched, nonetheless, in, south, china, warm, water, benthic, communities, with, complex, trophic, webs, thrived, immediately, following, lome, highly, endemic, faunas, which, characterized, the, late, ordovician, were, replaced, by, faunas, that, were, amongst, the, most, cosmopolitan, in, the, phanerozoic, biogeographic, patterns, that, persisted, throughout, most, of, the, silurian, lome, had, few, of, the, long, term, ecological, impacts, associated, with, the, permian, triassic, and, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, events, furthermore, biotic, recovery, from, lome, proceeded, at, a, much, faster, rate, than, it, did, after, the, permian, triassic, extinction, nevertheless, a, large, number, of, taxa, disappeared, from, the, earth, over, a, short, time, interval, eliminating, and, altering, the, relative, diversity, and, abundance, of, certain, groups, the, cambrian, type, evolutionary, fauna, nearly, died, out, and, was, unable, to, rediversify, after, the, extinction, brachiopod, diversity, and, composition, was, strongly, affected, with, the, cambrian, type, inarticulate, brachiopods, linguliforms, and, craniiforms, never, recovering, their, pre, extinction, diversity, articulate, rhynchonelliform, brachiopods, part, of, the, paleozoic, evolutionary, fauna, were, more, variable, in, their, response, to, the, extinction, some, early, rhynchonelliform, groups, such, as, the, orthida, and, strophomenida, declined, significantly, others, including, the, pentamerida, athyridida, spiriferida, and, atrypida, were, less, affected, and, took, the, opportunity, to, diversify, after, the, extinction, the, extinction, pulse, at, the, end, of, the, katian, was, selective, in, its, effects, disproportionally, affecting, deep, water, species, and, tropical, endemics, inhabiting, epicontinental, seas, the, foliomena, fauna, an, assemblage, of, thin, shelled, species, adapted, for, deep, dysoxic, low, oxygen, waters, went, extinct, completely, in, the, first, extinction, pulse, the, foliomena, fauna, was, formerly, widespread, and, resistant, to, background, extinction, rates, prior, to, the, hirnantian, so, their, unexpected, extinction, points, towards, the, abrupt, loss, of, their, specific, habitat, during, the, glaciation, a, high, latitude, brachiopod, assemblage, the, hirnantia, fauna, established, itself, along, outer, shelf, environments, in, lower, latitudes, probably, in, response, to, cooling, however, the, hirnantia, fauna, would, meet, its, demise, in, the, second, extinction, pulse, replaced, by, silurian, style, assemblages, adapted, for, warmer, waters, the, brachiopod, survival, intervals, following, the, second, pulse, spanned, the, terminal, hirnantian, to, the, middle, rhuddanian, after, which, the, recovery, interval, began, and, lasted, until, the, early, aeronian, overall, the, brachiopod, recovery, in, the, late, rhuddanian, was, rapid, brachiopod, survivors, of, the, mass, extinction, tended, to, be, endemic, to, one, palaeoplate, or, even, one, locality, in, the, survival, interval, in, the, earliest, silurian, though, their, ranges, geographically, expanded, over, the, course, of, the, biotic, recovery, the, region, around, what, is, today, oslo, was, a, hotbed, of, atrypide, rediversification, brachiopod, recovery, consisted, mainly, of, the, reestablishment, of, cosmopolitan, brachiopod, taxa, from, the, late, ordovician, progenitor, taxa, that, arose, following, the, mass, extinction, displayed, numerous, novel, adaptations, for, resisting, environmental, stresses, although, some, brachiopods, did, experience, the, lilliput, effect, in, response, to, the, extinction, this, phenomenon, was, not, particularly, widespread, compared, to, other, mass, extinctions, trilobites, were, hit, hard, by, both, phases, of, the, extinction, with, about, 70, of, genera, and, 50, of, families, going, extinct, between, the, katian, and, silurian, the, extinction, disproportionately, affected, deep, water, species, and, groups, with, fully, planktonic, larvae, or, adults, the, order, agnostida, was, completely, wiped, out, and, the, formerly, diverse, asaphida, survived, with, only, a, single, genus, raphiophorus, a, cool, water, trilobite, assemblage, the, mucronaspis, fauna, coincides, with, the, hirnantia, brachiopod, fauna, in, the, timing, of, its, expansion, and, demise, trilobite, faunas, after, the, extinction, were, dominated, by, families, that, appeared, in, the, ordovician, and, survived, lome, such, as, encrinuridae, and, odontopleuridae, over, a, third, of, bryozoan, genera, went, extinct, but, most, families, survived, the, extinction, interval, and, the, group, as, a, whole, recovered, in, the, silurian, the, hardest, hit, subgroups, were, the, cryptostomes, and, trepostomes, which, never, recovered, the, full, extent, of, their, ordovician, diversity, bryozoan, extinctions, started, in, coastal, regions, of, laurentia, before, high, extinction, rates, shifted, to, baltica, by, the, end, of, the, hirnantian, bryozoan, biodiversity, loss, appears, to, have, been, a, prolonged, process, which, partially, preceded, the, hirnantian, extinction, pulses, extinction, rates, among, ordovician, bryozoan, genera, were, actually, higher, in, the, early, and, late, katian, and, origination, rates, sharply, dropped, in, the, late, katian, and, hirnantian, about, 70, of, crinoid, genera, died, out, early, studies, of, crinoid, biodiversity, loss, by, jack, sepkoski, overestimated, crinoid, biodiversity, losses, during, lome, most, extinctions, occurred, in, the, first, pulse, however, they, rediversified, quickly, in, tropical, areas, and, reacquired, their, pre, extinction, diversity, not, long, into, the, silurian, many, other, echinoderms, became, very, rare, after, the, ordovician, such, as, the, cystoids, edrioasteroids, and, other, early, crinoid, like, groups, stromatoporoid, generic, and, familial, taxonomic, diversity, was, not, significantly, impacted, by, the, mass, extinction, sponges, thrived, and, dominated, marine, ecosystems, in, south, china, immediately, after, the, extinction, event, colonising, depauperate, anoxic, environments, in, the, earliest, rhuddanian, their, pervasiveness, in, marine, environments, after, the, biotic, crisis, has, been, attributed, to, drastically, decreased, competition, and, an, abundance, of, vacant, niches, left, behind, by, organisms, that, perished, in, the, catastrophe, sponges, may, have, assisted, the, recovery, of, other, sessile, suspension, feeders, by, helping, stabilise, sediment, surfaces, they, enabled, bryozoans, brachiopods, and, corals, to, recolonise, the, seafloor, the, first, pulse, of, the, late, ordovician, extinction, has, typically, been, attributed, to, the, late, ordovician, glaciation, which, is, unusual, among, mass, extinctions, and, has, made, lome, an, outlier, although, there, was, a, longer, cooling, trend, in, middle, and, lower, ordovician, the, most, severe, and, abrupt, period, of, glaciation, occurred, in, the, hirnantian, stage, which, was, bracketed, by, both, pulses, of, the, extinction, the, rapid, continental, glaciation, was, centered, on, gondwana, which, was, located, at, the, south, pole, in, the, late, ordovician, the, hirnantian, glaciation, is, considered, one, of, the, most, severe, ice, ages, of, the, paleozoic, which, previously, maintained, the, relatively, warm, climate, conditions, of, a, greenhouse, earth, the, cause, of, the, glaciation, is, heavily, debated, the, late, ordovician, glaciation, was, preceded, by, a, fall, in, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, from, 7, 000, ppm, to, 4, 400, ppm, atmospheric, and, oceanic, co, 2, levels, may, have, fluctuated, with, the, growth, and, decay, of, gondwanan, glaciation, the, appearance, and, development, of, terrestrial, plants, and, microphytoplankton, which, consumed, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, may, have, diminished, the, greenhouse, effect, and, promoting, the, transition, of, the, climatic, system, to, the, glacial, mode, heavy, silicate, weathering, of, the, uplifting, appalachians, and, caledonides, occurred, during, the, late, ordovician, which, sequestered, co, 2, in, the, hirnantian, stage, the, volcanism, diminished, and, the, continued, weathering, caused, a, significant, and, rapid, draw, down, of, co, 2, coincident, with, the, rapid, and, short, ice, age, as, earth, cooled, and, sea, levels, dropped, highly, weatherable, carbonate, platforms, became, exposed, above, water, enkindling, a, positive, feedback, loop, of, inorganic, carbon, sequestration, a, hypothetical, large, igneous, province, emplaced, during, the, katian, whose, existence, is, unproven, has, been, speculated, to, have, been, the, sink, that, absorbed, carbon, dioxide, and, precipitated, hirnantian, cooling, alternatively, volcanic, activity, may, have, caused, the, cooling, by, supplying, sulphur, aerosols, to, the, atmosphere, and, generating, severe, volcanic, winters, that, triggered, a, runaway, ice, albedo, positive, feedback, loop, in, addition, volcanic, fertilisation, of, the, oceans, with, phosphorus, may, have, increased, populations, of, photosynthetic, algae, and, enhanced, biological, sequestration, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, increased, burial, of, organic, carbon, is, another, method, of, drawing, down, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, that, may, have, played, a, role, in, the, late, ordovician, other, studies, point, to, an, asteroid, strike, and, impact, winter, as, the, culprit, for, the, glaciation, true, polar, wander, and, the, associated, rapid, palaeogeographic, changes, have, also, been, proposed, as, a, cause, two, environmental, changes, associated, with, the, glaciation, were, responsible, for, much, of, the, late, ordovician, extinction, first, the, cooling, global, climate, was, probably, especially, detrimental, because, the, biota, were, adapted, to, an, intense, greenhouse, especially, because, most, shallow, sea, habitats, in, the, ordovician, were, located, in, the, tropics, the, southward, shift, of, the, polar, front, severely, contracted, the, available, latitudinal, range, of, warm, adapted, organisms, second, sea, level, decline, caused, by, sequestering, of, water, in, the, ice, cap, drained, the, vast, epicontinental, seaways, and, eliminated, the, habitat, of, many, endemic, communities, the, dispersed, positions, of, the, continents, in, contrast, to, their, position, during, the, much, less, extinction, inducing, pleistocene, glaciations, made, glacioeustatic, marine, regression, especially, hazardous, to, marine, life, falling, sea, levels, may, have, acted, as, a, positive, feedback, loop, accelerating, further, cooling, as, shallow, seas, receded, carbonate, shelf, production, declined, and, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, levels, correspondingly, decreased, fostering, even, more, cooling, ice, caps, formed, on, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, as, it, drifted, over, the, south, pole, correlating, rock, strata, have, been, detected, in, late, ordovician, rock, strata, of, north, africa, and, then, adjacent, northeastern, south, america, which, were, south, polar, locations, at, the, time, glaciation, locks, up, water, from, the, world, ocean, and, interglacials, free, it, causing, sea, levels, repeatedly, to, drop, and, rise, the, vast, shallow, ordovician, seas, withdrew, which, eliminated, many, ecological, niches, then, returned, carrying, diminished, founder, populations, lacking, many, whole, families, of, organisms, then, they, withdrew, again, with, the, next, pulse, of, glaciation, eliminating, biological, diversity, at, each, change, in, the, north, african, strata, five, pulses, of, glaciation, from, seismic, sections, are, recorded, in, the, yangtze, platform, a, relict, warm, water, fauna, continued, to, persist, because, south, china, blocked, the, transport, of, cold, waters, from, gondwanan, waters, at, higher, latitudes, this, incurred, a, shift, in, the, location, of, bottom, water, formation, shifting, from, low, latitudes, characteristic, of, greenhouse, conditions, to, high, latitudes, characteristic, of, icehouse, conditions, which, was, accompanied, by, increased, deep, ocean, currents, and, oxygenation, of, the, bottom, water, an, opportunistic, fauna, briefly, thrived, there, before, anoxic, conditions, returned, the, breakdown, in, the, oceanic, circulation, patterns, brought, up, nutrients, from, the, abyssal, waters, surviving, species, were, those, that, coped, with, the, changed, conditions, and, filled, the, ecological, niches, left, by, the, extinctions, however, not, all, studies, agree, that, cooling, and, glaciation, caused, lomei, 1, one, study, suggests, that, the, first, pulse, began, not, during, the, rapid, hirnantian, ice, cap, expansion, but, in, an, interval, of, deglaciation, following, it, another, heavily, discussed, factor, in, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, is, anoxia, the, absence, of, dissolved, oxygen, in, seawater, anoxia, not, only, deprives, most, life, forms, of, a, vital, component, of, respiration, it, also, encourages, the, formation, of, toxic, metal, ions, and, other, compounds, one, of, the, most, common, of, these, poisonous, chemicals, is, hydrogen, sulfide, a, biological, waste, product, and, major, component, of, the, sulfur, cycle, oxygen, depletion, when, combined, with, high, levels, of, sulfide, is, called, euxinia, though, less, toxic, ferrous, iron, fe, 2, is, another, substance, which, commonly, forms, in, anoxic, waters, anoxia, is, the, most, common, culprit, for, the, second, pulse, of, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, and, is, connected, to, many, other, mass, extinctions, throughout, geological, time, it, may, have, also, had, a, role, in, the, first, pulse, of, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, though, support, for, this, hypothesis, is, inconclusive, and, contradicts, other, evidence, for, high, oxygen, levels, in, seawater, during, the, glaciation, some, geologists, have, argued, that, anoxia, played, a, role, in, the, first, extinction, pulse, though, this, hypothesis, is, controversial, in, the, early, hirnantian, shallow, water, sediments, throughout, the, world, experience, a, large, positive, excursion, in, the, 34, s, ratio, of, buried, pyrite, this, ratio, indicates, that, shallow, water, pyrite, which, formed, at, the, beginning, of, the, glaciation, had, a, decreased, proportion, of, 32, s, a, common, lightweight, isotope, of, sulfur, 32, s, in, the, seawater, could, hypothetically, be, used, up, by, extensive, deep, sea, pyrite, deposition, the, ordovician, ocean, also, had, very, low, levels, of, sulfate, a, nutrient, which, would, otherwise, resupply, 32, s, from, the, land, pyrite, forms, most, easily, in, anoxic, and, euxinic, environments, while, better, oxygenation, encourages, the, formation, of, gypsum, instead, as, a, result, anoxia, and, euxinia, would, need, to, be, common, in, the, deep, sea, to, produce, enough, pyrite, to, shift, the, 34, s, ratio, thallium, isotope, ratios, can, also, be, used, as, indicators, of, anoxia, a, major, positive, 205, tl, excursion, in, the, late, katian, just, before, the, katian, hirnantian, boundary, likely, reflects, a, global, enlargement, of, oxygen, minimum, zones, during, the, late, katian, thallium, isotopic, perturbations, indicating, proliferation, of, anoxic, waters, notably, preceded, the, appearance, of, other, geochemical, indicators, of, the, expansion, of, anoxia, a, more, direct, proxy, for, anoxic, conditions, is, fe, hr, fe, t, this, ratio, describes, the, comparative, abundance, of, highly, reactive, iron, compounds, which, are, only, stable, without, oxygen, most, geological, sections, corresponding, to, the, beginning, of, the, hirnantian, glaciation, have, fe, hr, fe, t, below, 0, 38, indicating, oxygenated, waters, however, higher, fe, hr, fe, t, values, are, known, from, a, few, deep, water, early, hirnantian, sequences, found, in, china, and, nevada, elevated, fe, py, fe, hr, values, have, also, been, found, in, association, with, lomei, 1, including, ones, above, 0, 8, that, are, tell, tale, indicators, of, euxinia, glaciation, could, conceivably, trigger, anoxic, conditions, albeit, indirectly, if, continental, shelves, are, exposed, by, falling, sea, levels, then, organic, surface, runoff, flows, into, deeper, oceanic, basins, the, organic, matter, would, have, more, time, to, leach, out, phosphate, and, other, nutrients, before, being, deposited, on, the, seabed, increased, phosphate, concentration, in, the, seawater, would, lead, to, eutrophication, and, then, anoxia, deep, water, anoxia, and, euxinia, would, impact, deep, water, benthic, fauna, as, expected, for, the, first, pulse, of, extinction, chemical, cycle, disturbances, would, also, steepen, the, chemocline, restricting, the, habitable, zone, of, planktonic, fauna, which, also, go, extinct, in, the, first, pulse, this, scenario, is, congruent, with, both, organic, carbon, isotope, excursions, and, general, extinction, patterns, observed, in, the, first, pulse, however, data, supporting, deep, water, anoxia, during, the, glaciation, contrasts, with, more, extensive, evidence, for, well, oxygenated, waters, black, shales, which, are, indicative, of, an, anoxic, environment, become, very, rare, in, the, early, hirnantian, compared, to, surrounding, time, periods, although, early, hirnantian, black, shales, can, be, found, in, a, few, isolated, ocean, basins, such, as, the, yangtze, platform, of, china, from, a, worldwide, perspective, these, correspond, to, local, events, some, chinese, sections, record, an, early, hirnantian, increase, in, the, abundance, of, mo, 98, a, heavy, isotope, of, molybdenum, this, shift, can, correspond, to, a, balance, between, minor, local, anoxia, and, well, oxygenated, waters, on, a, global, scale, other, trace, elements, point, towards, increased, deep, sea, oxygenation, at, the, start, of, the, glaciation, oceanic, current, modelling, suggest, that, glaciation, would, have, encouraged, oxygenation, in, most, areas, apart, from, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, devastation, of, the, dicranograptidae, diplograptidae, orthograptidae, ddo, graptolite, fauna, which, was, well, adapted, to, anoxic, conditions, further, suggests, that, lomei, 1, was, associated, with, increased, oxygenation, of, the, water, column, and, not, the, other, way, around, deep, sea, anoxia, is, not, the, only, explanation, for, the, 34, s, excursion, of, pyrite, carbonate, associated, sulfate, maintains, high, 32, s, levels, indicating, that, seawater, in, general, did, not, experience, 32, s, depletion, during, the, glaciation, even, if, pyrite, burial, did, increase, at, that, time, its, chemical, effects, would, have, been, far, too, slow, to, explain, the, rapid, excursion, or, extinction, pulse, instead, cooling, may, lower, the, metabolism, of, warm, water, aerobic, bacteria, reducing, decomposition, of, organic, matter, fresh, organic, matter, would, eventually, sink, down, and, supply, nutrients, to, sulfate, reducing, microbes, living, in, the, seabed, sulfate, reducing, microbes, prioritize, 32, s, during, anaerobic, respiration, leaving, behind, heavier, isotopes, a, bloom, of, sulfate, reducing, microbes, can, quickly, account, for, the, 34, s, excursion, in, marine, sediments, without, a, corresponding, decrease, in, oxygen, a, few, studies, have, proposed, that, the, first, extinction, pulse, did, not, begin, with, the, hirnantian, glaciation, but, instead, corresponds, to, an, interglacial, period, or, other, warming, event, anoxia, would, be, the, most, likely, mechanism, of, extinction, in, a, warming, event, as, evidenced, by, other, extinctions, involving, warming, however, this, view, of, the, first, extinction, pulse, is, controversial, and, not, widely, accepted, the, late, hirnantian, experienced, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, abundance, of, black, shales, coinciding, with, the, retreat, of, the, hirnantian, glaciation, black, shale, expands, out, of, isolated, basins, to, become, the, dominant, oceanic, sediment, at, all, latitudes, and, depths, the, worldwide, distribution, of, black, shales, in, the, late, hirnantian, is, indicative, of, a, global, anoxic, event, which, has, been, termed, the, hirnantian, ocean, anoxic, event, hoae, corresponding, to, widespread, anoxia, are, 34, s, cas, 98, mo, 238, u, and, nd, t, excursions, found, in, many, different, regions, at, least, in, european, sections, late, hirnantian, anoxic, waters, were, originally, ferruginous, dominated, by, ferrous, iron, before, gradually, becoming, more, euxinic, in, the, yangtze, sea, located, on, the, western, margins, of, the, south, china, microcontinent, the, second, extinction, pulse, occurred, alongside, intense, euxinia, which, spread, out, from, the, middle, of, the, continental, shelf, mercury, loading, in, south, china, during, lomei, 2, was, likely, related, to, euxinia, however, some, evidence, suggests, that, the, top, of, the, water, column, in, the, ordovician, oceans, remained, well, oxygenated, even, as, the, seafloor, became, deoxygenated, on, a, global, scale, euxinia, was, probably, one, or, two, orders, of, magnitude, more, prevalent, than, in, the, modern, day, global, anoxia, may, have, lasted, more, than, 3, million, years, persisting, through, the, entire, rhuddanian, stage, of, the, silurian, period, this, would, make, the, hirnantian, rhuddanian, anoxia, one, of, the, longest, lasting, anoxic, events, in, geologic, time, the, cause, of, the, hirnantian, rhuddanian, anoxic, event, is, uncertain, like, most, global, anoxic, events, an, increased, supply, of, nutrients, such, as, nitrates, and, phosphates, would, encourage, algal, or, microbial, blooms, that, deplete, oxygen, levels, in, the, seawater, the, most, likely, culprits, are, cyanobacteria, which, can, use, nitrogen, fixation, to, produce, usable, nitrogen, compounds, in, the, absence, of, nitrates, nitrogen, isotopes, during, the, anoxic, event, record, high, rates, of, denitrification, a, biological, process, which, depletes, nitrates, the, nitrogen, fixing, ability, of, cyanobacteria, would, give, them, an, edge, over, inflexible, competitors, like, eukaryotic, algae, at, anticosti, island, a, uranium, isotope, excursion, consistent, with, anoxia, actually, occurs, prior, to, indicators, of, receding, glaciation, this, may, suggest, that, the, hirnantian, rhuddanian, anoxic, event, and, its, corresponding, extinction, began, during, the, glaciation, not, after, it, cool, temperatures, can, lead, to, upwelling, cycling, nutrients, into, productive, surface, waters, via, air, and, ocean, cycles, upwelling, could, instead, be, encouraged, by, increasing, oceanic, stratification, through, an, input, of, freshwater, from, melting, glaciers, this, would, be, more, reasonable, if, the, anoxic, event, coincided, with, the, end, of, glaciation, as, supported, by, most, other, studies, however, oceanic, models, argue, that, marine, currents, would, recover, too, quickly, for, freshwater, disruptions, to, have, a, meaningful, effect, on, nutrient, cycles, retreating, glaciers, could, expose, more, land, to, weathering, which, would, be, a, more, sustained, source, of, phosphates, flowing, into, the, ocean, there, is, also, evidence, implicating, volcanism, as, a, contributor, to, late, hirnantian, anoxia, there, were, few, clear, patterns, of, extinction, associated, with, the, second, extinction, pulse, every, region, and, marine, environment, experienced, the, second, extinction, pulse, to, some, extent, many, taxa, which, survived, or, diversified, after, the, first, pulse, were, finished, off, in, the, second, pulse, these, include, the, hirnantia, brachiopod, fauna, and, mucronaspis, trilobite, fauna, which, previously, thrived, in, the, cold, glacial, period, other, taxa, such, as, graptolites, and, warm, water, reef, denizens, were, less, affected, sediments, from, china, and, baltica, seemingly, show, a, more, gradual, replacement, of, the, hirnantia, fauna, after, glaciation, although, this, suggests, that, the, second, extinction, pulse, may, have, been, a, minor, event, at, best, other, paleontologists, maintain, that, an, abrupt, ecological, turnover, accompanied, the, end, of, glaciation, there, may, be, a, correlation, between, the, relatively, slow, recovery, after, the, second, extinction, pulse, and, the, prolonged, nature, of, the, anoxic, event, which, accompanied, it, on, the, other, hand, the, occurrence, of, euxinic, pulses, similar, in, magnitude, to, lomei, 2, during, the, katian, without, ensuing, biological, collapses, has, caused, some, researchers, to, question, whether, euxinia, alone, could, have, been, lomei, 2, s, driver, deposition, of, black, graptolite, shales, continued, to, be, common, into, the, earliest, rhuddanian, indicating, that, anoxia, persisted, well, into, the, llandovery, a, sharp, reduction, in, the, average, size, of, many, organisms, likely, attributable, to, the, lilliput, effect, and, the, disappearance, of, many, relict, taxa, from, the, ordovician, indicate, a, third, extinction, interval, linked, to, an, expansion, of, anoxic, conditions, into, shallower, shelf, environments, particularly, in, baltica, this, sharp, decline, in, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, was, likely, linked, to, a, period, of, global, warming, documented, by, a, negative, carbon, isotope, excursion, preserved, in, baltican, sediments, toxic, metals, on, the, ocean, floor, may, have, dissolved, into, the, water, when, the, oceans, oxygen, was, depleted, an, increase, in, available, nutrients, in, the, oceans, may, have, been, a, factor, and, decreased, ocean, circulation, caused, by, global, cooling, may, also, have, been, a, factor, hg, toc, values, from, the, peri, baltic, region, indicate, noticeable, spikes, in, mercury, concentrations, during, the, lower, late, katian, the, katian, hirnantian, boundary, and, the, late, hirnantian, the, toxic, metals, may, have, killed, life, forms, in, lower, trophic, levels, of, the, food, chain, causing, a, decline, in, population, and, subsequently, resulting, in, starvation, for, the, dependent, higher, feeding, life, forms, in, the, chain, a, minority, hypothesis, to, explain, the, first, burst, has, been, proposed, by, philip, ball, adrian, lewis, melott, and, brian, c, thomas, suggesting, that, the, initial, extinctions, could, have, been, caused, by, a, gamma, ray, burst, originating, from, a, hypernova, in, a, nearby, arm, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, within, 6, 000, light, years, of, earth, a, ten, second, burst, would, have, stripped, the, earth, s, atmosphere, of, half, of, its, ozone, almost, immediately, exposing, surface, dwelling, organisms, including, those, responsible, for, planetary, photosynthesis, to, high, levels, of, extreme, ultraviolet, radiation, under, this, hypothesis, several, groups, of, marine, organisms, with, a, planktonic, lifestyle, were, more, exposed, to, more, uv, radiation, than, groups, that, lived, on, the, seabed, it, is, estimated, that, 20, to, 60, of, the, total, phytoplankton, biomass, on, earth, would, have, been, killed, in, such, an, event, because, the, oceans, were, mostly, oligotrophic, and, clear, during, the, late, ordovician, this, is, consistent, with, observations, that, planktonic, organisms, suffered, severely, during, the, first, extinction, pulse, in, addition, species, dwelling, in, shallow, water, were, more, likely, to, become, extinct, than, species, dwelling, in, deep, water, also, consistent, with, the, hypothetical, effects, of, a, galactic, gamma, ray, burst, a, gamma, ray, burst, could, also, explain, the, rapid, expansion, of, glaciers, since, the, high, energy, rays, would, cause, ozone, a, greenhouse, gas, to, dissociate, and, its, dissociated, oxygen, atoms, to, then, react, with, nitrogen, to, form, nitrogen, dioxide, a, darkly, coloured, aerosol, which, cools, the, planet, it, would, also, cohere, with, the, major, 13c, isotopic, excursion, indicating, increased, sequestration, of, carbon, 12, out, of, the, atmosphere, which, would, have, occurred, as, a, result, of, the, nitrogen, dioxide, reacting, with, hydroxyl, and, raining, back, down, to, earth, as, nitric, acid, precipitating, large, quantities, of, nitrates, that, would, have, enhanced, wetland, productivity, and, sequestration, of, carbon, dioxide, although, the, gamma, ray, burst, hypothesis, is, consistent, with, some, patterns, at, the, onset, of, extinction, there, is, no, unambiguous, evidence, that, such, a, nearby, gamma, ray, burst, ever, happened, though, more, commonly, associated, with, greenhouse, gases, and, global, warming, volcanoes, may, have, cooled, the, planet, and, precipitated, glaciation, by, discharging, sulphur, into, the, atmosphere, this, is, supported, by, a, positive, uptick, in, pyritic, 33, s, values, a, geochemical, signal, of, volcanic, sulphur, discharge, coeval, with, lomei, 1, more, recently, in, may, 2020, a, study, suggested, the, first, pulse, of, mass, extinction, was, caused, by, volcanism, which, induced, global, warming, and, anoxia, rather, than, cooling, and, glaciation, higher, resolution, of, species, diversity, patterns, in, the, late, ordovician, suggest, that, extinction, rates, rose, significantly, in, the, early, or, middle, katian, stage, several, million, years, earlier, than, the, hirnantian, glaciation, this, early, phase, of, extinction, is, associated, with, large, igneous, province, lip, activity, possibly, that, of, the, alborz, lip, of, northern, iran, as, well, as, a, warming, phase, known, as, the, boda, event, however, other, research, still, suggests, the, boda, event, was, a, cooling, event, instead, increased, volcanic, activity, during, the, early, late, katian, and, around, the, katian, hirnantian, boundary, is, also, implied, by, heightened, mercury, concentrations, relative, to, total, organic, carbon, marine, bentonite, layers, associated, with, the, subduction, of, the, junggar, ocean, underneath, the, yili, block, have, been, dated, to, the, late, katian, close, to, the, katian, hirnantian, boundary, volcanic, activity, could, also, provide, a, plausible, explanation, for, anoxia, during, the, first, pulse, of, the, mass, extinction, a, volcanic, input, of, phosphorus, which, was, insufficient, to, enkindle, persistent, anoxia, on, its, own, may, have, triggered, a, positive, feedback, loop, of, phosphorus, recycling, from, marine, sediments, sustaining, widespread, marine, oxygen, depletion, over, the, course, of, lomei, 1, also, the, weathering, of, nutrient, rich, volcanic, rocks, emplaced, during, the, middle, and, late, katian, likely, enhanced, the, reduction, in, dissolved, oxygen, intense, volcanism, also, fits, in, well, with, the, attribution, of, euxinia, as, the, main, driver, of, lomei, 2, sudden, volcanism, at, the, ordovician, silurian, boundary, is, suggested, to, have, supplied, abundant, sulphur, dioxide, greatly, facilitating, the, development, of, euxinia, other, papers, have, criticised, the, volcanism, hypothesis, claiming, that, volcanic, activity, was, relatively, low, in, the, ordovician, and, that, superplume, and, lip, volcanic, activity, is, especially, unlikely, to, have, caused, the, mass, extinction, at, the, end, of, the, ordovician, a, 2022, study, argued, against, a, volcanic, cause, of, lome, citing, the, lack, of, mercury, anomalies, and, the, discordance, between, deposition, of, bentonites, and, redox, changes, in, drillcores, from, south, china, straddling, the, ordovician, silurian, boundary, mercury, anomalies, at, the, end, of, the, ordovician, relative, to, total, organic, carbon, or, hg, toc, that, some, researchers, have, attributed, to, large, scale, volcanism, have, been, reinterpreted, by, some, to, be, flawed, because, the, main, mercury, host, in, the, ordovician, was, sulphide, and, thus, hg, ts, should, be, used, instead, hg, ts, values, show, no, evidence, of, volcanogenic, mercury, loading, a, finding, bolstered, by, 199, hg, measurements, much, higher, than, would, be, expected, for, volcanogenic, mercury, input, a, 2023, paper, points, to, the, deniliquin, multiple, ring, feature, in, southeastern, australia, which, has, been, dated, to, around, the, start, of, lomei, 1, for, initiating, the, intense, hirnantian, glaciation, and, the, first, pulse, of, the, extinction, event, according, to, the, paper, it, still, requires, further, research, to, test, the, idea
