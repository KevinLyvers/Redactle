an, aerosol, is, a, suspension, of, fine, solid, particles, or, liquid, droplets, in, air, or, another, gas, aerosols, can, be, generated, from, natural, or, human, causes, the, term, aerosol, commonly, refers, to, the, mixture, of, particulates, in, air, and, not, to, the, particulate, matter, alone, examples, of, natural, aerosols, are, fog, mist, or, dust, examples, of, human, caused, aerosols, include, particulate, air, pollutants, mist, from, the, discharge, at, hydroelectric, dams, irrigation, mist, perfume, from, atomizers, smoke, dust, sprayed, pesticides, and, medical, treatments, for, respiratory, illnesses, several, types, of, atmospheric, aerosol, have, a, significant, effect, on, earth, s, climate, volcanic, desert, dust, sea, salt, that, originating, from, biogenic, sources, and, human, made, volcanic, aerosol, forms, in, the, stratosphere, after, an, eruption, as, droplets, of, sulfuric, acid, that, can, prevail, for, up, to, two, years, and, reflect, sunlight, lowering, temperature, desert, dust, mineral, particles, blown, to, high, altitudes, absorb, heat, and, may, be, responsible, for, inhibiting, storm, cloud, formation, human, made, sulfate, aerosols, primarily, from, burning, oil, and, coal, affect, the, behavior, of, clouds, when, aerosols, absorb, pollutants, it, facilitates, the, deposition, of, pollutants, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, as, well, as, to, bodies, of, water, this, has, the, potential, to, be, damaging, to, both, the, environment, and, human, health, ship, tracks, are, clouds, that, form, around, the, exhaust, released, by, ships, into, the, still, ocean, air, water, molecules, collect, around, the, tiny, particles, aerosols, from, exhaust, to, form, a, cloud, seed, more, and, more, water, accumulates, on, the, seed, until, a, visible, cloud, is, formed, in, the, case, of, ship, tracks, the, cloud, seeds, are, stretched, over, a, long, narrow, path, where, the, wind, has, blown, the, ship, s, exhaust, so, the, resulting, clouds, resemble, long, strings, over, the, ocean, the, warming, caused, by, human, produced, greenhouse, gases, has, been, somewhat, offset, by, the, cooling, effect, of, human, produced, aerosols, in, 2020, regulations, on, fuel, significantly, cut, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, from, international, shipping, by, approximately, 80, leading, to, an, unexpected, global, geoengineering, termination, shock, the, liquid, or, solid, particles, in, an, aerosol, have, diameters, typically, less, than, 1, m, larger, particles, with, a, significant, settling, speed, make, the, mixture, a, suspension, but, the, distinction, is, not, clear, in, everyday, language, aerosol, often, refers, to, a, dispensing, system, that, delivers, a, consumer, product, from, a, spray, can, diseases, can, spread, by, means, of, small, droplets, in, the, breath, sometimes, called, bioaerosols, aerosol, is, defined, as, a, suspension, system, of, solid, or, liquid, particles, in, a, gas, an, aerosol, includes, both, the, particles, and, the, suspending, gas, which, is, usually, air, meteorologists, usually, refer, to, them, as, particle, matter, pm2, 5, or, pm10, depending, on, their, size, frederick, g, donnan, presumably, first, used, the, term, aerosol, during, world, war, i, to, describe, an, aero, solution, clouds, of, microscopic, particles, in, air, this, term, developed, analogously, to, the, term, hydrosol, a, colloid, system, with, water, as, the, dispersed, medium, primary, aerosols, contain, particles, introduced, directly, into, the, gas, secondary, aerosols, form, through, gas, to, particle, conversion, key, aerosol, groups, include, sulfates, organic, carbon, black, carbon, nitrates, mineral, dust, and, sea, salt, they, usually, clump, together, to, form, a, complex, mixture, various, types, of, aerosol, classified, according, to, physical, form, and, how, they, were, generated, include, dust, fume, mist, smoke, and, fog, there, are, several, measures, of, aerosol, concentration, environmental, science, and, environmental, health, often, use, the, mass, concentration, m, defined, as, the, mass, of, particulate, matter, per, unit, volume, in, units, such, as, g, m, 3, also, commonly, used, is, the, number, concentration, n, the, number, of, particles, per, unit, volume, in, units, such, as, number, per, m, 3, or, number, per, cm, 3, particle, size, has, a, major, influence, on, particle, properties, and, the, aerosol, particle, radius, or, diameter, d, p, is, a, key, property, used, to, characterise, aerosols, aerosols, vary, in, their, dispersity, a, monodisperse, aerosol, producible, in, the, laboratory, contains, particles, of, uniform, size, most, aerosols, however, as, polydisperse, colloidal, systems, exhibit, a, range, of, particle, sizes, liquid, droplets, are, almost, always, nearly, spherical, but, scientists, use, an, equivalent, diameter, to, characterize, the, properties, of, various, shapes, of, solid, particles, some, very, irregular, the, equivalent, diameter, is, the, diameter, of, a, spherical, particle, with, the, same, value, of, some, physical, property, as, the, irregular, particle, the, equivalent, volume, diameter, d, e, is, defined, as, the, diameter, of, a, sphere, of, the, same, volume, as, that, of, the, irregular, particle, also, commonly, used, is, the, aerodynamic, diameter, d, a, people, generate, aerosols, for, various, purposes, including, some, devices, for, generating, aerosols, are, several, types, of, atmospheric, aerosol, have, a,

although, all, hydrometeors, solid, and, liquid, can, be, described, as, aerosols, a, distinction, is, commonly, made, between, such, dispersions, i, e, clouds, containing, activated, drops, and, crystals, and, aerosol, particles, the, atmosphere, of, earth, contains, aerosols, of, various, types, and, concentrations, including, quantities, of, aerosols, can, be, found, in, urban, ecosystems, in, various, forms, for, example, the, presence, of, aerosols, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, can, influence, its, climate, as, well, as, human, health, volcanic, eruptions, release, large, amounts, of, sulphuric, acid, hydrogen, sulfide, and, hydrochloric, acid, into, the, atmosphere, these, gases, represent, aerosols, and, eventually, return, to, earth, as, acid, rain, having, a, number, of, adverse, effects, on, the, environment, and, human, life, when, aerosols, absorb, pollutants, it, facilitates, the, deposition, of, pollutants, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, as, well, as, to, bodies, of, water, this, has, the, potential, to, be, damaging, to, both, the, environment, and, human, health, aerosols, interact, with, the, earth, s, energy, budget, in, two, ways, directly, and, indirectly, ship, tracks, are, clouds, that, form, around, the, exhaust, released, by, ships, into, the, still, ocean, air, water, molecules, collect, around, the, tiny, particles, aerosols, from, exhaust, to, form, a, cloud, seed, more, and, more, water, accumulates, on, the, seed, until, a, visible, cloud, is, formed, in, the, case, of, ship, tracks, the, cloud, seeds, are, stretched, over, a, long, narrow, path, where, the, wind, has, blown, the, ship, s, exhaust, so, the, resulting, clouds, resemble, long, strings, over, the, ocean, the, warming, caused, by, human, produced, greenhouse, gases, has, been, somewhat, offset, by, the, cooling, effect, of, human, produced, aerosols, in, 2020, regulations, on, fuel, significantly, cut, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, from, international, shipping, by, approximately, 80, leading, to, an, unexpected, global, geoengineering, termination, shock, aerosols, in, the, 20, m, range, show, a, particularly, long, persistence, time, in, air, conditioned, rooms, due, to, their, jet, rider, behaviour, move, with, air, jets, gravitationally, fall, out, in, slowly, moving, air, as, this, aerosol, size, is, most, effectively, adsorbed, in, the, human, nose, the, primordial, infection, site, in, covid, 19, such, aerosols, may, contribute, to, the, pandemic, aerosol, particles, with, an, effective, diameter, smaller, than, 10, m, can, enter, the, bronchi, while, the, ones, with, an, effective, diameter, smaller, than, 2, 5, m, can, enter, as, far, as, the, gas, exchange, region, in, the, lungs, which, can, be, hazardous, to, human, health, for, a, monodisperse, aerosol, a, single, number, the, particle, diameter, suffices, to, describe, the, size, of, the, particles, however, more, complicated, particle, size, distributions, describe, the, sizes, of, the, particles, in, a, polydisperse, aerosol, this, distribution, defines, the, relative, amounts, of, particles, sorted, according, to, size, one, approach, to, defining, the, particle, size, distribution, uses, a, list, of, the, sizes, of, every, particle, in, a, sample, however, this, approach, proves, tedious, to, ascertain, in, aerosols, with, millions, of, particles, and, awkward, to, use, another, approach, splits, the, size, range, into, intervals, and, finds, the, number, or, proportion, of, particles, in, each, interval, these, data, can, be, presented, in, a, histogram, with, the, area, of, each, bar, representing, the, proportion, of, particles, in, that, size, bin, usually, normalised, by, dividing, the, number, of, particles, in, a, bin, by, the, width, of, the, interval, so, that, the, area, of, each, bar, is, proportionate, to, the, number, of, particles, in, the, size, range, that, it, represents, if, the, width, of, the, bins, tends, to, zero, the, frequency, function, is, where, therefore, the, area, under, the, frequency, curve, between, two, sizes, a, and, b, represents, the, total, fraction, of, the, particles, in, that, size, range, it, can, also, be, formulated, in, terms, of, the, total, number, density, n, assuming, spherical, aerosol, particles, the, aerosol, surface, area, per, unit, volume, s, is, given, by, the, second, moment, and, the, third, moment, gives, the, total, volume, concentration, v, of, the, particles, the, particle, size, distribution, can, be, approximated, the, normal, distribution, usually, does, not, suitably, describe, particle, size, distributions, in, aerosols, because, of, the, skewness, associated, with, a, long, tail, of, larger, particles, also, for, a, quantity, that, varies, over, a, large, range, as, many, aerosol, sizes, do, the, width, of, the, distribution, implies, negative, particles, sizes, which, is, not, physically, realistic, however, the, normal, distribution, can, be, suitable, for, some, aerosols, such, as, test, aerosols, certain, pollen, grains, and, spores, a, more, widely, chosen, log, normal, distribution, gives, the, number, frequency, as, where, the, log, normal, distribution, has, no, negative, values, can, cover, a, wide, range, of, values, and, fits, many, observed, size, distributions, reasonably, well, other, distributions, sometimes, used, to, characterise, particle, size, include, the, rosin, rammler, distribution, applied, to, coarsely, dispersed, dusts, and, sprays, the, nukiyama, tanasawa, distribution, for, sprays, of, extremely, broad, size, ranges, the, power, function, distribution, occasionally, applied, to, atmospheric, aerosols, the, exponential, distribution, applied, to, powdered, materials, and, for, cloud, droplets, the, khrgian, mazin, distribution, for, low, values, of, the, reynolds, number, 1, true, for, most, aerosol, motion, stokes, law, describes, the, force, of, resistance, on, a, solid, spherical, particle, in, a, fluid, however, stokes, law, is, only, valid, when, the, velocity, of, the, gas, at, the, surface, of, the, particle, is, zero, for, small, particles, 1, m, that, characterize, aerosols, however, this, assumption, fails, to, account, for, this, failure, one, can, introduce, the, cunningham, correction, factor, always, greater, than, 1, including, this, factor, one, finds, the, relation, between, the, resisting, force, on, a, particle, and, its, velocity, where, this, allows, us, to, calculate, the, terminal, velocity, of, a, particle, undergoing, gravitational, settling, in, still, air, neglecting, buoyancy, effects, we, find, where, the, terminal, velocity, can, also, be, derived, for, other, kinds, of, forces, if, stokes, law, holds, then, the, resistance, to, motion, is, directly, proportional, to, speed, the, constant, of, proportionality, is, the, mechanical, mobility, b, of, a, particle, a, particle, traveling, at, any, reasonable, initial, velocity, approaches, its, terminal, velocity, exponentially, with, an, e, folding, time, equal, to, the, relaxation, time, where, to, account, for, the, effect, of, the, shape, of, non, spherical, particles, a, correction, factor, known, as, the, dynamic, shape, factor, is, applied, to, stokes, law, it, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, resistive, force, of, the, irregular, particle, to, that, of, a, spherical, particle, with, the, same, volume, and, velocity, where, the, aerodynamic, diameter, of, an, irregular, particle, is, defined, as, the, diameter, of, the, spherical, particle, with, a, density, of, 1000, kg, m, 3, and, the, same, settling, velocity, as, the, irregular, particle, neglecting, the, slip, correction, the, particle, settles, at, the, terminal, velocity, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, aerodynamic, diameter, d, a, where, this, equation, gives, the, aerodynamic, diameter, one, can, apply, the, aerodynamic, diameter, to, particulate, pollutants, or, to, inhaled, drugs, to, predict, where, in, the, respiratory, tract, such, particles, deposit, pharmaceutical, companies, typically, use, aerodynamic, diameter, not, geometric, diameter, to, characterize, particles, in, inhalable, drugs, the, previous, discussion, focused, on, single, aerosol, particles, in, contrast, aerosol, dynamics, explains, the, evolution, of, complete, aerosol, populations, the, concentrations, of, particles, will, change, over, time, as, a, result, of, many, processes, external, processes, that, move, particles, outside, a, volume, of, gas, under, study, include, diffusion, gravitational, settling, and, electric, charges, and, other, external, forces, that, cause, particle, migration, a, second, set, of, processes, internal, to, a, given, volume, of, gas, include, particle, formation, nucleation, evaporation, chemical, reaction, and, coagulation, a, differential, equation, called, the, aerosol, general, dynamic, equation, gde, characterizes, the, evolution, of, the, number, density, of, particles, in, an, aerosol, due, to, these, processes, change, in, time, convective, transport, brownian, diffusion, gas, particle, interactions, coagulation, migration, by, external, forces, where, as, particles, and, droplets, in, an, aerosol, collide, with, one, another, they, may, undergo, coalescence, or, aggregation, this, process, leads, to, a, change, in, the, aerosol, particle, size, distribution, with, the, mode, increasing, in, diameter, as, total, number, of, particles, decreases, on, occasion, particles, may, shatter, apart, into, numerous, smaller, particles, however, this, process, usually, occurs, primarily, in, particles, too, large, for, consideration, as, aerosols, the, knudsen, number, of, the, particle, define, three, different, dynamical, regimes, that, govern, the, behaviour, of, an, aerosol, where, displaystyle, lambda, is, the, mean, free, path, of, the, suspending, gas, and, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, diameter, of, the, particle, for, particles, in, the, free, molecular, regime, k, n, 1, particles, small, compared, to, the, mean, free, path, of, the, suspending, gas, in, this, regime, particles, interact, with, the, suspending, gas, through, a, series, of, ballistic, collisions, with, gas, molecules, as, such, they, behave, similarly, to, gas, molecules, tending, to, follow, streamlines, and, diffusing, rapidly, through, brownian, motion, the, mass, flux, equation, in, the, free, molecular, regime, is, where, a, is, the, particle, radius, p, and, p, a, are, the, pressures, far, from, the, droplet, and, at, the, surface, of, the, droplet, respectively, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, t, is, the, temperature, c, a, is, mean, thermal, velocity, and, is, mass, accommodation, coefficient, the, derivation, of, this, equation, assumes, constant, pressure, and, constant, diffusion, coefficient, particles, are, in, the, continuum, regime, when, k, n, 1, in, this, regime, the, particles, are, big, compared, to, the, mean, free, path, of, the, suspending, gas, meaning, that, the, suspending, gas, acts, as, a, continuous, fluid, flowing, round, the, particle, the, molecular, flux, in, this, regime, is, where, a, is, the, radius, of, the, particle, a, m, a, is, the, molecular, mass, of, the, particle, a, d, ab, is, the, diffusion, coefficient, between, particles, a, and, b, r, is, the, ideal, gas, constant, t, is, the, temperature, in, absolute, units, like, kelvin, and, p, a, and, p, as, are, the, pressures, at, infinite, and, at, the, surface, respectively, the, transition, regime, contains, all, the, particles, in, between, the, free, molecular, and, continuum, regimes, or, k, n, 1, the, forces, experienced, by, a, particle, are, a, complex, combination, of, interactions, with, individual, gas, molecules, and, macroscopic, interactions, the, semi, empirical, equation, describing, mass, flux, is, where, i, cont, is, the, mass, flux, in, the, continuum, regime, this, formula, is, called, the, fuchs, sutugin, interpolation, formula, these, equations, do, not, take, into, account, the, heat, release, effect, aerosol, partitioning, theory, governs, condensation, on, and, evaporation, from, an, aerosol, surface, respectively, condensation, of, mass, causes, the, mode, of, the, particle, size, distributions, of, the, aerosol, to, increase, conversely, evaporation, causes, the, mode, to, decrease, nucleation, is, the, process, of, forming, aerosol, mass, from, the, condensation, of, a, gaseous, precursor, specifically, a, vapor, net, condensation, of, the, vapor, requires, supersaturation, a, partial, pressure, greater, than, its, vapor, pressure, this, can, happen, for, three, reasons, there, are, two, types, of, nucleation, processes, gases, preferentially, condense, onto, surfaces, of, pre, existing, aerosol, particles, known, as, heterogeneous, nucleation, this, process, causes, the, diameter, at, the, mode, of, particle, size, distribution, to, increase, with, constant, number, concentration, with, sufficiently, high, supersaturation, and, no, suitable, surfaces, particles, may, condense, in, the, absence, of, a, pre, existing, surface, known, as, homogeneous, nucleation, this, results, in, the, addition, of, very, small, rapidly, growing, particles, to, the, particle, size, distribution, water, coats, particles, in, aerosols, making, them, activated, usually, in, the, context, of, forming, a, cloud, droplet, such, as, natural, cloud, seeding, by, aerosols, from, trees, in, a, forest, following, the, kelvin, equation, based, on, the, curvature, of, liquid, droplets, smaller, particles, need, a, higher, ambient, relative, humidity, to, maintain, equilibrium, than, larger, particles, do, the, following, formula, gives, relative, humidity, at, equilibrium, where, p, s, displaystyle, p, s, is, the, saturation, vapor, pressure, above, a, particle, at, equilibrium, around, a, curved, liquid, droplet, p, 0, is, the, saturation, vapor, pressure, flat, surface, of, the, same, liquid, and, s, is, the, saturation, ratio, kelvin, equation, for, saturation, vapor, pressure, above, a, curved, surface, is, where, r, p, droplet, radius, surface, tension, of, droplet, density, of, liquid, m, molar, mass, t, temperature, and, r, molar, gas, constant, there, are, no, general, solutions, to, the, general, dynamic, equation, gde, common, methods, used, to, solve, the, general, dynamic, equation, include, aerosol, can, either, be, measured, in, situ, or, with, remote, sensing, techniques, some, available, in, situ, measurement, techniques, include, remote, sensing, approaches, include, particles, can, deposit, in, the, nose, mouth, pharynx, and, larynx, the, head, airways, region, deeper, within, the, respiratory, tract, from, the, trachea, to, the, terminal, bronchioles, or, in, the, alveolar, region, the, location, of, deposition, of, aerosol, particles, within, the, respiratory, system, strongly, determines, the, health, effects, of, exposure, to, such, aerosols, this, phenomenon, led, people, to, invent, aerosol, samplers, that, select, a, subset, of, the, aerosol, particles, that, reach, certain, parts, of, the, respiratory, system, examples, of, these, subsets, of, the, particle, size, distribution, of, an, aerosol, important, in, occupational, health, include, the, inhalable, thoracic, and, respirable, fractions, the, fraction, that, can, enter, each, part, of, the, respiratory, system, depends, on, the, deposition, of, particles, in, the, upper, parts, of, the, airway, the, inhalable, fraction, of, particles, defined, as, the, proportion, of, particles, originally, in, the, air, that, can, enter, the, nose, or, mouth, depends, on, external, wind, speed, and, direction, and, on, the, particle, size, distribution, by, aerodynamic, diameter, the, thoracic, fraction, is, the, proportion, of, the, particles, in, ambient, aerosol, that, can, reach, the, thorax, or, chest, region, the, respirable, fraction, is, the, proportion, of, particles, in, the, air, that, can, reach, the, alveolar, region, to, measure, the, respirable, fraction, of, particles, in, air, a, pre, collector, is, used, with, a, sampling, filter, the, pre, collector, excludes, particles, as, the, airways, remove, particles, from, inhaled, air, the, sampling, filter, collects, the, particles, for, measurement, it, is, common, to, use, cyclonic, separation, for, the, pre, collector, but, other, techniques, include, impactors, horizontal, elutriators, and, large, pore, membrane, filters, two, alternative, size, selective, criteria, often, used, in, atmospheric, monitoring, are, pm, 10, and, pm, 2, 5, pm, 10, is, defined, by, iso, as, particles, which, pass, through, a, size, selective, inlet, with, a, 50, efficiency, cut, off, at, 10, m, aerodynamic, diameter, and, pm, 2, 5, as, particles, which, pass, through, a, size, selective, inlet, with, a, 50, efficiency, cut, off, at, 2, 5, m, aerodynamic, diameter, pm, 10, corresponds, to, the, thoracic, convention, as, defined, in, iso, 7708, 1995, clause, 6, pm, 2, 5, corresponds, to, the, high, risk, respirable, convention, as, defined, in, iso, 7708, 1995, 7, 1, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, replaced, the, older, standards, for, particulate, matter, based, on, total, suspended, particulate, with, another, standard, based, on, pm, 10, in, 1987, and, then, introduced, standards, for, pm, 2, 5, also, known, as, fine, particulate, matter, in, 1997
