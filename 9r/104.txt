stratosphere, 98, 4, nitrogen, n, 2, 1, 4, methane, ch, 4, 0, 2, hydrogen, h, 2, titan, is, the, largest, moon, of, saturn, and, the, second, largest, in, the, solar, system, it, is, the, only, moon, known, to, have, an, atmosphere, denser, than, the, earth, s, and, is, the, only, known, object, in, space, other, than, earth, on, which, there, is, clear, evidence, that, stable, bodies, of, liquid, exist, titan, is, one, of, seven, gravitationally, rounded, moons, of, saturn, and, the, second, most, distant, among, them, frequently, described, as, a, planet, like, moon, titan, is, 50, larger, in, diameter, than, earth, s, moon, and, 80, more, massive, it, is, the, second, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, after, jupiter, s, ganymede, and, is, larger, than, mercury, yet, titan, is, only, 40, as, massive, as, mercury, because, mercury, is, mainly, iron, and, rock, while, much, of, titan, is, ice, which, is, less, dense, discovered, in, 1655, by, the, dutch, astronomer, christiaan, huygens, titan, was, the, first, known, moon, of, saturn, and, the, sixth, known, planetary, satellite, after, earth, s, moon, and, the, four, galilean, moons, of, jupiter, titan, orbits, saturn, at, 20, saturn, radii, or, 1, 200, 000, km, above, saturn, s, apparent, surface, from, titan, s, surface, saturn, subtends, an, arc, of, 5, 09, degrees, and, if, it, were, visible, through, the, moon, s, thick, atmosphere, it, would, appear, 11, 4, times, larger, in, the, sky, in, diameter, than, the, moon, from, earth, which, subtends, 0, 48, of, arc, titan, is, primarily, composed, of, ice, and, rocky, material, with, a, rocky, core, surrounded, by, various, layers, of, ice, including, a, crust, of, ice, i, h, and, a, subsurface, layer, of, ammonia, rich, liquid, water, much, as, with, venus, before, the, space, age, the, dense, opaque, atmosphere, prevented, understanding, of, titan, s, surface, until, the, cassini, huygens, mission, in, 2004, provided, new, information, including, the, discovery, of, liquid, hydrocarbon, lakes, in, titan, s, polar, regions, and, the, discovery, of, its, atmospheric, super, rotation, the, geologically, young, surface, is, generally, smooth, with, few, impact, craters, although, mountains, and, several, possible, cryovolcanoes, have, been, found, the, atmosphere, of, titan, is, mainly, nitrogen, and, methane, minor, components, lead, to, the, formation, of, hydrocarbon, clouds, and, heavy, organonitrogen, haze, its, climate, including, wind, and, rain, creates, surface, features, similar, to, those, of, earth, such, as, dunes, rivers, lakes, seas, probably, of, liquid, methane, and, ethane, and, deltas, and, is, dominated, by, seasonal, weather, patterns, as, on, earth, with, its, liquids, both, surface, and, subsurface, and, robust, nitrogen, atmosphere, titan, s, methane, cycle, nearly, resembles, earth, s, water, cycle, albeit, at, a, much, lower, temperature, of, about, 94, k, 179, c, 290, f, due, to, these, factors, titan, is, called, the, most, earth, like, celestial, object, in, the, solar, system, the, dutch, astronomer, christiaan, huygens, discovered, titan, on, march, 25, 1655, fascinated, by, galileo, s, 1610, discovery, of, jupiter, s, four, largest, moons, and, his, advancements, in, telescope, technology, huygens, with, the, help, of, his, elder, brother, constantijn, huygens, jr, began, building, telescopes, around, 1650, and, discovered, the, first, observed, moon, orbiting, saturn, with, one, of, the, telescopes, they, built, huygens, named, his, discovery, saturni, luna, or, luna, saturni, latin, for, moon, of, saturn, publishing, in, the, 1655, tract, de, saturni, luna, observatio, nova, a, new, observation, of, saturn, s, moon, after, giovanni, domenico, cassini, published, his, discoveries, of, four, more, moons, of, saturn, between, 1673, and, 1686, astronomers, began, referring, to, these, and, titan, as, saturn, i, through, v, with, titan, then, in, fourth, position, other, early, epithets, for, titan, include, saturn, s, ordinary, satellite, the, international, astronomical, union, officially, numbers, titan, as, saturn, vi, the, name, titan, and, the, names, of, all, seven, satellites, of, saturn, then, known, came, from, john, herschel, son, of, william, herschel, discoverer, of, two, other, saturnian, moons, mimas, and, enceladus, in, his, 1847, publication, results, of, astronomical, observations, made, during, the, years, 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at, the, cape, of, good, hope, numerous, small, moons, have, been, discovered, around, saturn, since, then, saturnian, moons, are, named, after, mythological, giants, the, name, titan, comes, from, the, titans, a, race, of, immortals, in, greek, mythology, the, regular, moons, of, jupiter, and, saturn, likely, formed, via, co, accretion, similar, to, the, process, believed, to, have, formed, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, as, the, young, gas, giants, formed, they, were, surrounded, by, discs, of, material, that, gradually, coalesced, into, moons, while, the, four, galilean, moons, of, jupiter, exist, in, highly, regular, planet, like, orbits, titan, overwhelmingly, dominates, saturn, s, system, and, has, a, high, orbital, eccentricity, not, immediately, explained, by, co, accretion, alone, a, proposed, model, for, the, formation, of, titan, is, that, saturn, s, system, began, with, a, group, of, moons, similar, to, jupiter, s, galilean, moons, but, that, they, were, disrupted, by, a, series, of, giant, impacts, which, would, go, on, to, form, titan, saturn, s, mid, sized, moons, such, as, iapetus, and, rhea, were, formed, from, the, debris, of, these, collisions, such, a, violent, beginning, would, also, explain, titan, s, orbital, eccentricity, a, 2014, analysis, of, titan, s, atmospheric, nitrogen, suggested, that, it, was, possibly, sourced, from, material, similar, to, that, found, in, the, oort, cloud, and, not, from, sources, present, during, the, co, accretion, of, materials, around, saturn, titan, orbits, saturn, once, every, 15, days, and, 22, hours, like, earth, s, moon, and, many, of, the, satellites, of, the, giant, planets, its, rotational, period, its, day, is, identical, to, its, orbital, period, titan, is, tidally, locked, in, synchronous, rotation, with, saturn, and, permanently, shows, one, face, to, the, planet, longitudes, on, titan, are, measured, westward, starting, from, the, meridian, passing, through, this, point, its, orbital, eccentricity, is, 0, 0288, and, the, orbital, plane, is, inclined, 0, 348, degrees, relative, to, the, saturnian, equator, the, small, and, irregularly, shaped, satellite, hyperion, is, locked, in, a, 3, 4, orbital, resonance, with, titan, that, is, hyperion, orbits, three, times, for, every, four, times, titan, orbits, hyperion, probably, formed, in, a, stable, orbital, island, whereas, the, massive, titan, absorbed, or, ejected, any, other, bodies, that, made, close, approaches, titan, is, 5, 149, 46, kilometres, 3, 199, 73, mi, in, diameter, it, is, 6, larger, than, the, planet, mercury, and, 50, larger, than, earth, s, moon, titan, is, the, tenth, largest, object, known, in, the, solar, system, including, the, sun, before, the, arrival, of, voyager, 1, in, 1980, titan, was, thought, to, be, slightly, larger, than, ganymede, which, has, a, diameter, 5, 262, kilometres, 3, 270, mi, and, thus, the, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, this, was, an, overestimation, caused, by, titan, s, dense, opaque, atmosphere, with, a, haze, layer, 100, 200, kilometers, above, its, surface, this, increases, its, apparent, diameter, titan, s, diameter, and, mass, and, thus, its, density, are, similar, to, those, of, the, jovian, moons, ganymede, and, callisto, based, on, its, bulk, density, of, 1, 881, g, cm, 3, titan, s, composition, is, 40, 60, rock, with, the, rest, being, water, ice, and, other, materials, 30, titan, is, probably, partially, differentiated, into, distinct, layers, with, a, 3, 400, kilometre, 2, 100, mi, rocky, center, this, rocky, center, is, believed, to, be, surrounded, by, several, layers, composed, of, different, crystalline, forms, of, ice, and, or, water, the, exact, structure, depends, heavily, on, the, heat, flux, from, within, titan, itself, which, is, poorly, constrained, the, interior, may, still, be, hot, enough, for, a, liquid, layer, consisting, of, a, magma, composed, of, water, and, ammonia, between, the, ice, i, h, crust, and, deeper, ice, layers, made, of, high, pressure, forms, of, ice, the, heat, flow, from, inside, titan, may, even, be, too, high, for, high, pressure, ices, to, form, with, the, outermost, layers, instead, consisting, primarily, of, liquid, water, underneath, a, surface, crust, the, presence, of, ammonia, allows, water, to, remain, liquid, even, at, a, temperature, as, low, as, 176, k, 97, c, for, eutectic, mixture, with, water, the, cassini, probe, discovered, evidence, for, the, layered, structure, in, the, form, of, natural, extremely, low, frequency, radio, waves, in, titan, s, atmosphere, titan, s, surface, is, thought, to, be, a, poor, reflector, of, extremely, low, frequency, radio, waves, so, they, may, instead, be, reflecting, off, the, liquid, ice, boundary, of, a, subsurface, ocean, surface, features, were, observed, by, the, cassini, spacecraft, to, systematically, shift, by, up, to, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, between, october, 2005, and, may, 2007, which, suggests, that, the, crust, is, decoupled, from, the, interior, and, provides, additional, evidence, for, an, interior, liquid, layer, further, supporting, evidence, for, a, liquid, layer, and, ice, shell, decoupled, from, the, solid, core, comes, from, the, way, the, gravity, field, varies, as, titan, orbits, saturn, comparison, of, the, gravity, field, with, the, radar, based, topography, observations, also, suggests, that, the, ice, shell, may, be, substantially, rigid, titan, is, the, only, moon, in, the, solar, system, with, an, atmosphere, denser, than, earth, s, with, a, surface, pressure, of, 1, 448, atm, 834, and, it, is, one, of, only, two, moons, whose, atmospheres, are, able, to, support, clouds, hazes, and, weather, the, other, being, neptune, s, moon, triton, 872, the, presence, of, a, significant, atmosphere, was, first, suspected, by, catalan, astronomer, josep, comas, i, sol, who, observed, distinct, limb, darkening, on, titan, in, 1903, due, to, the, extensive, hazy, atmosphere, titan, was, once, thought, to, be, the, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, until, the, voyager, missions, revealed, that, ganymede, is, slightly, larger, 831, the, haze, also, shrouded, titan, s, surface, from, view, so, direct, images, of, its, surface, could, not, be, taken, until, the, cassini, huygens, mission, in, 2004, the, primary, constituents, of, titan, s, atmosphere, are, nitrogen, methane, and, hydrogen, 243, the, precise, atmospheric, composition, varies, depending, on, altitude, and, latitude, due, to, methane, cycling, between, a, gas, and, a, liquid, in, titan, s, lower, atmosphere, the, methane, cycle, nitrogen, is, the, most, abundant, gas, with, a, concentration, of, around, 98, 6, in, the, stratosphere, that, decreases, to, 95, 1, in, the, troposphere, direct, observations, by, the, huygens, probe, determined, that, methane, concentrations, are, highest, near, the, surface, with, a, concentration, of, 4, 92, that, remains, relatively, constant, up, to, 8, kilometres, 5, 0, mi, above, the, surface, methane, concentrations, then, gradually, decrease, with, increasing, altitude, down, to, a, concentration, of, 1, 41, in, the, stratosphere, 243, 244, methane, also, increases, in, concentration, near, titan, s, winter, pole, probably, due, to, evaporation, from, the, surface, in, high, latitude, regions, 385, hydrogen, is, the, third, most, abundant, gas, with, a, concentration, of, around, 0, 1, 243, there, are, trace, amounts, of, other, hydrocarbons, such, as, ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene, and, propane, and, other, gases, such, as, cyanoacetylene, hydrogen, cyanide, carbon, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, cyanogen, argon, and, helium, the, hydrocarbons, are, thought, to, form, in, titan, s, upper, atmosphere, in, reactions, resulting, from, the, breakup, of, methane, by, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, light, producing, a, thick, orange, smog, energy, from, the, sun, should, have, converted, all, traces, of, methane, in, titan, s, atmosphere, into, more, complex, hydrocarbons, within, 50, million, years, a, short, time, compared, to, the, age, of, the, solar, system, this, suggests, that, methane, must, be, replenished, by, a, reservoir, on, or, within, titan, itself, the, ultimate, origin, of, the, methane, in, its, atmosphere, may, be, its, interior, released, via, eruptions, from, cryovolcanoes, on, april, 3, 2013, nasa, reported, that, complex, organic, chemicals, collectively, called, tholins, likely, arise, on, titan, based, on, studies, simulating, the, atmosphere, of, titan, on, june, 6, 2013, scientists, at, the, iaa, csic, reported, the, detection, of, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, in, the, upper, atmosphere, of, titan, on, september, 30, 2013, propene, was, detected, in, the, atmosphere, of, titan, by, nasa, s, cassini, spacecraft, using, its, composite, infrared, spectrometer, cirs, this, is, the, first, time, propene, has, been, found, on, any, moon, or, planet, other, than, earth, and, is, the, first, chemical, found, by, the, cirs, the, detection, of, propene, fills, a, mysterious, gap, in, observations, that, date, back, to, nasa, s, voyager, 1, spacecraft, s, first, close, planetary, flyby, of, titan, in, 1980, during, which, it, was, discovered, that, many, of, the, gases, that, make, up, titan, s, brown, haze, were, hydrocarbons, theoretically, formed, via, the, recombination, of, radicals, created, by, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, photolysis, of, methane, titan, s, surface, temperature, is, about, 94, k, 179, 2, c, at, this, temperature, water, ice, has, an, extremely, low, vapor, pressure, so, the, little, water, vapor, present, appears, limited, to, the, stratosphere, titan, receives, about, 1, as, much, sunlight, as, earth, before, sunlight, reaches, the, surface, about, 90, has, been, absorbed, by, the, thick, atmosphere, leaving, only, 0, 1, of, the, amount, of, light, earth, receives, atmospheric, methane, creates, a, greenhouse, effect, on, titan, s, surface, without, which, titan, would, be, much, colder, conversely, haze, in, titan, s, atmosphere, contributes, to, an, anti, greenhouse, effect, by, absorbing, sunlight, canceling, a, portion, of, the, greenhouse, effect, and, making, its, surface, significantly, colder, than, its, upper, atmosphere, titan, s, clouds, probably, composed, of, methane, ethane, or, other, simple, organics, are, scattered, and, variable, punctuating, the, overall, haze, the, findings, of, the, huygens, probe, indicate, that, titan, s, atmosphere, periodically, rains, liquid, methane, and, other, organic, compounds, onto, its, surface, clouds, typically, cover, 1, of, titan, s, disk, though, outburst, events, have, been, observed, in, which, the, cloud, cover, rapidly, expands, to, as, much, as, 8, one, hypothesis, asserts, that, the, southern, clouds, are, formed, when, heightened, levels, of, sunlight, during, the, southern, summer, generate, uplift, in, the, atmosphere, resulting, in, convection, this, explanation, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, cloud, formation, has, been, observed, not, only, after, the, southern, summer, solstice, but, also, during, mid, spring, increased, methane, humidity, at, the, south, pole, possibly, contributes, to, the, rapid, increases, in, cloud, size, it, was, summer, in, titan, s, southern, hemisphere, until, 2010, when, saturn, s, orbit, which, governs, titan, s, motion, moved, titan, s, northern, hemisphere, into, the, sunlight, when, the, seasons, switch, it, is, expected, that, ethane, will, begin, to, condense, over, the, south, pole, the, surface, of, titan, has, been, described, as, complex, fluid, processed, geologically, young, titan, has, been, around, since, the, solar, system, s, formation, but, its, surface, is, much, younger, between, 100, million, and, 1, billion, years, old, geological, processes, may, have, reshaped, titan, s, surface, titan, s, atmosphere, is, four, times, as, thick, as, earth, s, making, it, difficult, for, astronomical, instruments, to, image, its, surface, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, the, cassini, spacecraft, used, infrared, instruments, radar, altimetry, and, synthetic, aperture, radar, sar, imaging, to, map, portions, of, titan, during, its, close, fly, bys, the, first, images, revealed, a, diverse, geology, with, both, rough, and, smooth, areas, there, are, features, that, may, be, volcanic, in, origin, disgorging, water, mixed, with, ammonia, onto, the, surface, there, is, also, evidence, that, titan, s, ice, shell, may, be, substantially, rigid, which, would, suggest, little, geologic, activity, there, are, also, streaky, features, some, of, them, hundreds, of, kilometers, in, length, that, appear, to, be, caused, by, windblown, particles, examination, has, also, shown, the, surface, to, be, relatively, smooth, the, few, features, that, seem, to, be, impact, craters, appeared, to, have, been, partially, filled, in, perhaps, by, raining, hydrocarbons, or, cryovolcanism, radar, altimetry, suggests, topographical, variation, is, low, typically, no, more, than, 150, meters, occasional, elevation, changes, of, 500, meters, have, been, discovered, and, titan, has, mountains, that, sometimes, reach, several, hundred, meters, to, more, than, 1, kilometer, in, height, titan, s, surface, is, marked, by, broad, regions, of, bright, and, dark, terrain, these, include, xanadu, a, large, reflective, equatorial, area, about, the, size, of, australia, it, was, first, identified, in, infrared, images, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, in, 1994, and, later, viewed, by, the, cassini, spacecraft, the, convoluted, region, is, filled, with, hills, and, cut, by, valleys, and, chasms, it, is, criss, crossed, in, places, by, dark, lineaments, sinuous, topographical, features, resembling, ridges, or, crevices, these, may, represent, tectonic, activity, which, would, indicate, that, xanadu, is, geologically, young, alternatively, the, lineaments, may, be, liquid, formed, channels, suggesting, old, terrain, that, has, been, cut, through, by, stream, systems, there, are, dark, areas, of, similar, size, elsewhere, on, titan, observed, from, the, ground, and, by, cassini, at, least, one, of, these, ligeia, mare, titan, s, second, largest, sea, is, almost, a, pure, methane, sea, following, the, voyager, flybys, titan, was, confirmed, to, have, an, atmosphere, capable, of, supporting, liquid, hydrocarbons, on, its, surface, however, the, first, tentative, detection, only, came, in, 1995, when, data, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, radar, observations, suggested, expansive, hydrocarbon, lakes, seas, or, oceans, the, existence, of, liquid, hydrocarbons, on, titan, was, finally, confirmed, in, situ, by, the, cassini, orbiter, with, the, cassini, mission, team, announcing, definitive, evidence, of, the, presence, of, lakes, filled, with, liquid, methane, on, saturn, s, moon, titan, in, january, 2007, the, observed, lakes, and, seas, of, titan, are, largely, restricted, to, its, polar, regions, where, colder, temperatures, allow, the, presence, of, permanent, liquid, hydrocarbons, 58, near, titan, s, north, pole, are, kraken, mare, the, largest, sea, ligeia, mare, the, second, largest, sea, and, punga, mare, each, filling, broad, depressions, and, cumulatively, representing, roughly, 80, of, titan, s, sea, and, lake, coverage, 691, 000, square, kilometres, 267, 000, sq, mi, combined, all, three, maria, s, sea, levels, are, similar, suggesting, that, they, may, be, hydraulically, connected, the, southern, polar, region, meanwhile, hosts, four, dry, broad, depressions, potentially, representing, dried, up, seabeds, additional, smaller, lakes, occupy, titan, s, polar, regions, covering, a, cumulative, surface, area, of, 215, 000, square, kilometres, 83, 000, sq, mi, lakes, in, titan, s, lower, latitude, and, equatorial, regions, have, been, proposed, though, none, have, been, confirmed, seasonal, or, transient, equatorial, lakes, may, pool, following, large, rainstorms, 60, cassini, radar, data, has, been, used, to, conduct, bathymetry, of, titan, s, seas, and, lakes, using, detected, subsurface, reflections, the, measured, maximum, depth, of, ligeia, mare, is, roughly, 200, metres, 660, ft, and, that, of, ontario, lacus, is, roughly, 90, metres, 300, ft, 67, 70, titan, s, lakes, and, seas, are, dominated, by, methane, ch, 4, with, smaller, amounts, of, ethane, c, 2, h, 6, and, dissolved, nitrogen, n, 2, the, fraction, of, these, components, varies, across, different, bodies, observations, of, ligeia, mare, are, consistent, with, 71, ch, 4, 12, c, 2, h, 6, and, 17, n, 2, by, volume, whilst, ontario, lacus, is, consistent, with, 49, ch, 4, 41, c, 2, h, 6, and, 10, n, 2, by, volume, as, titan, is, synchronously, locked, with, saturn, there, exists, a, permanent, tidal, bulge, of, roughly, 100, metres, 330, ft, at, the, sub, and, anti, saturnian, points, titan, s, orbital, eccentricity, means, that, tidal, acceleration, varies, by, 9, though, the, long, orbital, period, means, that, these, tidal, cycles, are, very, gradual, 70, 71, a, team, of, researchers, led, by, ralph, d, lorenz, evaluated, that, the, tidal, range, of, titan, s, major, seas, are, around, 0, 2, 0, 8, metres, 0, 66, 2, 62, ft, 12, through, cassini, radar, mapping, of, titan, s, surface, numerous, landforms, have, been, interpreted, as, candidate, cryovolcanic, and, tectonic, features, by, multiple, authors, 14, a, 2016, analysis, of, mountainous, ridges, on, titan, revealed, that, ridges, are, concentrated, in, titan, s, equatorial, regions, implying, that, ridges, either, form, more, frequently, in, or, are, better, preserved, in, low, latitude, regions, the, ridges, primarily, oriented, east, to, west, are, linear, to, arcuate, in, shape, with, the, authors, of, the, analysis, comparing, them, to, terrestrial, fold, belts, indicative, of, horizontal, compression, or, convergence, they, note, that, the, global, distribution, of, titan, s, ridges, could, be, indicative, of, global, contraction, with, a, thickened, ice, shell, causing, regional, uplift, 23, 25, the, identification, of, cryovolcanic, features, on, titan, remains, controversial, and, inconclusive, primarily, due, to, limitations, of, cassini, imagery, and, coverage, cassini, radar, and, vims, imagery, revealed, several, candidate, cryovolcanic, features, particularly, flow, like, terrains, in, western, xanadu, and, steep, sided, lakes, in, the, northern, hemisphere, that, resemble, maar, craters, on, earth, which, are, created, by, explosive, subterranean, eruptions, the, likeliest, cryovolcano, features, is, a, complex, of, landforms, that, includes, two, mountains, doom, mons, and, erebor, mons, a, large, depression, sotra, patera, and, a, system, of, flow, like, features, mohini, fluctus, between, 2005, and, 2006, parts, of, sotra, patera, and, mohini, fluctus, became, significantly, brighter, whilst, the, surrounding, plains, remained, unchanged, potentially, indicative, of, ongoing, cryovolcanic, activity, 21, 23, indirect, lines, of, evidence, for, cryovolcanism, include, the, presence, of, argon, 40, in, titan, s, atmosphere, radiogenic, 40, ar, is, sourced, from, the, decay, of, 40, k, and, has, likely, been, produced, within, titan, over, the, course, of, billions, of, years, within, its, rocky, core, 40, ar, s, presence, in, titan, s, atmosphere, is, thus, supportive, of, active, geology, on, titan, with, cryovolcanism, being, one, possible, method, of, bringing, the, isotope, up, from, the, interior, titan, s, surface, has, comparatively, few, impact, craters, with, erosion, tectonics, and, cryovolcanism, possibly, working, to, erase, them, over, time, compared, to, the, craters, of, similarly, sized, and, structured, ganymede, and, callisto, those, of, titan, are, much, shallower, many, have, dark, floors, of, sediment, geomorphological, analysis, of, impact, craters, largely, suggests, that, erosion, and, burial, are, the, primary, mechanisms, of, crater, modification, 2, titan, s, craters, are, also, not, evenly, distributed, as, the, polar, regions, are, almost, devoid, of, any, identified, craters, whilst, the, majority, are, located, in, the, equatorial, dune, fields, this, inequality, may, be, the, result, of, oceans, that, once, occupied, titan, s, poles, polar, sediment, deposition, by, past, rainfall, or, increased, rates, of, erosion, in, the, polar, regions, 19, the, majority, of, titan, s, surface, is, covered, by, plains, of, the, several, types, of, plains, observed, the, most, extensive, are, the, undifferentiated, plains, that, encompass, vast, radar, dark, uniform, regions, 15, these, mid, latitude, plains, located, largely, between, 20, 60, north, or, south, appear, younger, than, all, major, geological, features, except, dunes, and, several, craters, 177, the, undifferentiated, plains, likely, were, formed, by, wind, driven, processes, and, composed, of, organic, rich, sediment, 180, another, extensive, type, of, terrain, on, titan, are, sand, dunes, grouped, together, into, vast, dune, fields, or, sand, seas, located, within, 30, north, or, south, titanian, dunes, are, typically, 1, 2, kilometres, 0, 62, 1, 24, mi, wide, and, spaced, 1, 4, kilometres, 0, 62, 2, 49, mi, apart, with, some, individual, dunes, over, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, in, length, limited, radar, derived, height, data, suggests, that, the, dunes, are, 80, 130, metres, 260, 430, ft, tall, with, the, dunes, appearing, dark, in, cassini, sar, imagery, interactions, between, the, dunes, and, obstacle, features, such, as, mountains, indicate, that, sand, is, generally, transported, in, a, west, to, east, direction, the, sand, that, constructs, the, dunes, is, dominated, by, organic, material, probably, from, titan, s, atmosphere, possible, sources, of, sand, include, river, channels, or, the, undifferentiated, plains, 16, 18, titan, is, never, visible, to, the, naked, eye, but, can, be, observed, through, small, telescopes, or, strong, binoculars, amateur, observation, is, difficult, because, of, the, proximity, of, titan, to, saturn, s, brilliant, globe, and, ring, system, an, occulting, bar, covering, part, of, the, eyepiece, and, used, to, block, the, bright, planet, greatly, improves, viewing, titan, has, a, maximum, apparent, magnitude, of, 8, 2, and, mean, opposition, magnitude, 8, 4, this, compares, to, 4, 6, for, the, similarly, sized, ganymede, in, the, jovian, system, observations, of, titan, prior, to, the, space, age, were, limited, in, 1907, spanish, astronomer, josep, comas, i, sol, observed, limb, darkening, of, titan, the, first, evidence, that, the, body, has, an, atmosphere, in, 1944, gerard, p, kuiper, used, a, spectroscopic, technique, to, detect, an, atmosphere, of, methane, the, first, probe, to, visit, the, saturnian, system, was, pioneer, 11, in, 1979, which, revealed, that, titan, was, probably, too, cold, to, support, life, it, took, images, of, titan, including, titan, and, saturn, together, in, mid, to, late, 1979, the, quality, was, soon, surpassed, by, the, two, voyagers, titan, was, examined, by, both, voyager, 1, and, 2, in, 1980, and, 1981, respectively, voyager, 1, s, trajectory, was, designed, to, provide, an, optimized, titan, flyby, during, which, the, spacecraft, was, able, to, determine, the, density, composition, and, temperature, of, the, atmosphere, and, obtain, a, precise, measurement, of, titan, s, mass, atmospheric, haze, prevented, direct, imaging, of, the, surface, though, in, 2004, intensive, digital, processing, of, images, taken, through, voyager, 1, s, orange, filter, did, reveal, hints, of, the, light, and, dark, features, now, known, as, xanadu, and, shangri, la, which, had, been, observed, in, the, infrared, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, voyager, 2, which, would, have, been, diverted, to, perform, the, titan, flyby, if, voyager, 1, had, been, unable, to, did, not, pass, near, titan, and, continued, on, to, uranus, and, neptune, 94, the, cassini, huygens, spacecraft, reached, saturn, on, july, 1, 2004, and, began, the, process, of, mapping, titan, s, surface, by, radar, a, joint, project, of, the, european, space, agency, esa, and, nasa, cassini, huygens, proved, a, very, successful, mission, the, cassini, probe, flew, by, titan, on, october, 26, 2004, and, took, the, highest, resolution, images, ever, of, titan, s, surface, at, only, 1, 200, kilometres, 750, mi, discerning, patches, of, light, and, dark, that, would, be, invisible, to, the, human, eye, on, july, 22, 2006, cassini, made, its, first, targeted, close, fly, by, at, 950, kilometres, 590, mi, from, titan, the, closest, flyby, was, at, 880, kilometres, 550, mi, on, june, 21, 2010, liquid, has, been, found, in, abundance, on, the, surface, in, the, north, polar, region, in, the, form, of, many, lakes, and, seas, discovered, by, cassini, huygens, was, an, atmospheric, probe, that, touched, down, on, titan, on, january, 14, 2005, discovering, that, many, of, its, surface, features, seem, to, have, been, formed, by, fluids, at, some, point, in, the, past, titan, is, the, most, distant, body, from, earth, to, have, a, space, probe, land, on, its, surface, the, huygens, probe, landed, just, off, the, easternmost, tip, of, a, bright, region, now, called, adiri, the, probe, photographed, pale, hills, with, dark, rivers, running, down, to, a, dark, plain, current, understanding, is, that, the, hills, also, referred, to, as, highlands, are, composed, mainly, of, water, ice, dark, organic, compounds, created, in, the, upper, atmosphere, by, the, ultraviolet, radiation, of, the, sun, may, rain, from, titan, s, atmosphere, they, are, washed, down, the, hills, with, the, methane, rain, and, are, deposited, on, the, plains, over, geological, time, scales, after, landing, huygens, photographed, a, dark, plain, covered, in, small, rocks, and, pebbles, which, are, composed, of, water, ice, the, two, rocks, just, below, the, middle, of, the, image, on, the, right, are, smaller, than, they, may, appear, the, left, hand, one, is, 15, centimeters, across, and, the, one, in, the, center, is, 4, centimeters, across, at, a, distance, of, about, 85, centimeters, from, huygens, there, is, evidence, of, erosion, at, the, base, of, the, rocks, indicating, possible, fluvial, activity, the, ground, surface, is, darker, than, originally, expected, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, water, and, hydrocarbon, ice, in, march, 2007, nasa, esa, and, cospar, decided, to, name, the, huygens, landing, site, the, hubert, curien, memorial, station, in, memory, of, the, former, president, of, the, esa, the, dragonfly, mission, developed, and, operated, by, the, johns, hopkins, applied, physics, laboratory, will, launch, in, july, 2028, it, consists, of, a, large, drone, powered, by, an, rtg, to, fly, in, the, atmosphere, of, titan, as, new, frontiers, 4, its, instruments, will, study, how, far, prebiotic, chemistry, may, have, progressed, the, mission, is, planned, to, arrive, at, titan, in, the, mid, 2030s, there, have, been, several, conceptual, missions, proposed, in, recent, years, for, returning, a, robotic, space, probe, to, titan, initial, conceptual, work, has, been, completed, for, such, missions, by, nasa, and, jpl, and, esa, at, present, none, of, these, proposals, have, become, funded, missions, the, titan, saturn, system, mission, tssm, was, a, joint, nasa, esa, proposal, for, exploration, of, saturn, s, moons, it, envisions, a, hot, air, balloon, floating, in, titan, s, atmosphere, for, six, months, it, was, competing, against, the, europa, jupiter, system, mission, ejsm, proposal, for, funding, in, february, 2009, it, was, announced, that, esa, nasa, had, given, the, ejsm, mission, priority, ahead, of, the, tssm, the, proposed, titan, mare, explorer, time, was, a, low, cost, lander, that, would, splash, down, in, ligeia, mare, in, titan, s, northern, hemisphere, the, probe, would, float, whilst, investigating, titan, s, hydrocarbon, cycle, sea, chemistry, and, titan, s, origins, it, was, selected, for, a, phase, a, design, study, in, 2011, as, a, candidate, mission, for, the, 12th, nasa, discovery, program, opportunity, but, was, not, selected, for, flight, another, mission, to, titan, proposed, in, early, 2012, by, jason, barnes, a, scientist, at, the, university, of, idaho, is, the, aerial, vehicle, for, in, situ, and, airborne, titan, reconnaissance, aviatr, an, uncrewed, plane, or, drone, that, would, fly, through, titan, s, atmosphere, and, take, high, definition, images, of, the, surface, of, titan, nasa, did, not, approve, the, requested, 715, million, and, the, future, of, the, project, is, uncertain, a, conceptual, design, for, another, lake, lander, was, proposed, in, late, 2012, by, the, spanish, based, private, engineering, firm, sener, and, the, centro, de, astrobiolog, a, in, madrid, the, concept, probe, is, called, titan, lake, in, situ, sampling, propelled, explorer, talise, the, major, difference, compared, to, the, time, probe, would, be, that, talise, is, envisioned, with, its, own, propulsion, system, and, would, therefore, not, be, limited, to, simply, drifting, on, the, lake, when, it, splashes, down, a, discovery, program, contestant, for, its, mission, 13, is, journey, to, enceladus, and, titan, jet, an, astrobiology, saturn, orbiter, that, would, assess, the, habitability, potential, of, enceladus, and, titan, in, 2015, the, nasa, innovative, advanced, concepts, program, niac, awarded, a, phase, ii, grant, to, a, design, study, of, a, titan, submarine, to, explore, the, seas, of, titan, titan, is, thought, to, be, a, prebiotic, environment, rich, in, complex, organic, compounds, but, its, surface, is, in, a, deep, freeze, at, 179, c, 290, 2, f, 94, 1, k, so, it, is, currently, understood, that, life, cannot, exist, on, the, moon, s, frigid, surface, however, titan, seems, to, contain, a, global, ocean, beneath, its, ice, shell, and, within, this, ocean, conditions, are, potentially, suitable, for, microbial, life, the, cassini, huygens, mission, was, not, equipped, to, provide, evidence, for, biosignatures, or, complex, organic, compounds, it, showed, an, environment, on, titan, that, is, similar, in, some, ways, to, ones, hypothesized, for, the, primordial, earth, scientists, surmise, that, the, atmosphere, of, early, earth, was, similar, in, composition, to, the, current, atmosphere, on, titan, with, the, important, exception, of, a, lack, of, water, vapor, on, titan, the, miller, urey, experiment, and, several, following, experiments, have, shown, that, with, an, atmosphere, similar, to, that, of, titan, and, the, addition, of, uv, radiation, complex, molecules, and, polymer, substances, like, tholins, can, be, generated, the, reaction, starts, with, dissociation, of, nitrogen, and, methane, forming, hydrogen, cyanide, and, acetylene, further, reactions, have, been, studied, extensively, it, has, been, reported, that, when, energy, was, applied, to, a, combination, of, gases, like, those, in, titan, s, atmosphere, five, nucleotide, bases, the, building, blocks, of, dna, and, rna, were, among, the, many, compounds, produced, in, addition, amino, acids, the, building, blocks, of, protein, were, found, it, was, the, first, time, nucleotide, bases, and, amino, acids, had, been, found, in, such, an, experiment, without, liquid, water, being, present, laboratory, simulations, have, led, to, the, suggestion, that, enough, organic, material, exists, on, titan, to, start, a, chemical, evolution, analogous, to, what, is, thought, to, have, started, life, on, earth, the, analogy, assumes, the, presence, of, liquid, water, for, longer, periods, than, is, currently, observable, several, hypotheses, postulate, that, liquid, water, from, an, impact, could, be, preserved, under, a, frozen, isolation, layer, it, has, also, been, hypothesized, that, liquid, ammonia, oceans, could, exist, deep, below, the, surface, another, model, suggests, an, ammonia, water, solution, as, much, as, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, deep, beneath, a, water, ice, crust, with, conditions, that, although, extreme, by, terrestrial, standards, are, such, that, life, could, survive, heat, transfer, between, the, interior, and, upper, layers, would, be, critical, in, sustaining, any, subsurface, oceanic, life, detection, of, microbial, life, on, titan, would, depend, on, its, biogenic, effects, with, the, atmospheric, methane, and, nitrogen, examined, it, has, been, speculated, that, life, could, exist, in, the, lakes, of, liquid, methane, on, titan, just, as, organisms, on, earth, live, in, water, such, organisms, would, inhale, h, 2, in, place, of, o, 2, metabolize, it, with, acetylene, instead, of, glucose, and, exhale, methane, instead, of, carbon, dioxide, however, such, hypothetical, organisms, would, be, required, to, metabolize, at, a, deep, freeze, temperature, of, 179, 2, c, 290, 6, f, 94, 0, k, all, life, forms, on, earth, including, methanogens, use, liquid, water, as, a, solvent, it, is, speculated, that, life, on, titan, might, instead, use, a, liquid, hydrocarbon, such, as, methane, or, ethane, although, water, is, a, stronger, solvent, than, methane, water, is, also, more, chemically, reactive, and, can, break, down, large, organic, molecules, through, hydrolysis, a, life, form, whose, solvent, was, a, hydrocarbon, would, not, face, the, risk, of, its, biomolecules, being, destroyed, in, this, way, in, 2005, astrobiologist, chris, mckay, argued, that, if, methanogenic, life, did, exist, on, the, surface, of, titan, it, would, likely, have, a, measurable, effect, on, the, mixing, ratio, in, the, titan, troposphere, levels, of, hydrogen, and, acetylene, would, be, measurably, lower, than, otherwise, expected, assuming, metabolic, rates, similar, to, those, of, methanogenic, organisms, on, earth, the, concentration, of, molecular, hydrogen, would, drop, by, a, factor, of, 1000, on, the, titanian, surface, solely, due, to, a, hypothetical, biological, sink, mckay, noted, that, if, life, is, indeed, present, the, low, temperatures, on, titan, would, result, in, very, slow, metabolic, processes, which, could, conceivably, be, hastened, by, the, use, of, catalysts, similar, to, enzymes, he, also, noted, that, the, low, solubility, of, organic, compounds, in, methane, presents, a, more, significant, challenge, to, any, possible, form, of, life, forms, of, active, transport, and, organisms, with, large, surface, to, volume, ratios, could, theoretically, lessen, the, disadvantages, posed, by, this, fact, in, 2010, darrell, strobel, from, johns, hopkins, university, identified, a, greater, abundance, of, molecular, hydrogen, in, the, upper, atmospheric, layers, of, titan, compared, to, the, lower, layers, arguing, for, a, downward, flow, at, a, rate, of, roughly, 10, 28, molecules, per, second, and, disappearance, of, hydrogen, near, titan, s, surface, as, strobel, noted, his, findings, were, in, line, with, the, effects, mckay, had, predicted, if, methanogenic, life, forms, were, present, the, same, year, another, study, showed, low, levels, of, acetylene, on, titan, s, surface, which, were, interpreted, by, mckay, as, consistent, with, the, hypothesis, of, organisms, consuming, hydrocarbons, although, restating, the, biological, hypothesis, he, cautioned, that, other, explanations, for, the, hydrogen, and, acetylene, findings, are, more, likely, the, possibilities, of, yet, unidentified, physical, or, chemical, processes, e, g, a, surface, catalyst, accepting, hydrocarbons, or, hydrogen, or, flaws, in, the, current, models, of, material, flow, composition, data, and, transport, models, need, to, be, substantiated, etc, even, so, despite, saying, that, a, non, biological, catalytic, explanation, would, be, less, startling, than, a, biological, one, mckay, noted, that, the, discovery, of, a, catalyst, effective, at, 95, k, 180, c, would, still, be, significant, with, regards, to, the, acetylene, findings, mark, allen, the, principal, investigator, with, the, nasa, astrobiology, institute, titan, team, provided, a, speculative, non, biological, explanation, sunlight, or, cosmic, rays, could, transform, the, acetylene, in, icy, aerosols, in, the, atmosphere, into, more, complex, molecules, that, would, fall, to, the, ground, with, no, acetylene, signature, as, nasa, notes, in, its, news, article, on, the, june, 2010, findings, to, date, methane, based, life, forms, are, only, hypothetical, scientists, have, not, yet, detected, this, form, of, life, anywhere, as, the, nasa, statement, also, says, some, scientists, believe, these, chemical, signatures, bolster, the, argument, for, a, primitive, exotic, form, of, life, or, precursor, to, life, on, titan, s, surface, in, february, 2015, a, hypothetical, cell, membrane, capable, of, functioning, in, liquid, methane, at, cryogenic, temperatures, deep, freeze, conditions, was, modeled, composed, of, small, molecules, containing, carbon, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, it, would, have, the, same, stability, and, flexibility, as, cell, membranes, on, earth, which, are, composed, of, phospholipids, compounds, of, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and, phosphorus, this, hypothetical, cell, membrane, was, termed, an, azotosome, a, combination, of, azote, french, for, nitrogen, and, liposome, despite, these, biological, possibilities, there, are, formidable, obstacles, to, life, on, titan, and, any, analogy, to, earth, is, inexact, at, a, vast, distance, from, the, sun, titan, is, frigid, and, its, atmosphere, lacks, co, 2, at, titan, s, surface, water, exists, only, in, solid, form, because, of, these, difficulties, scientists, such, as, jonathan, lunine, have, viewed, titan, less, as, a, likely, habitat, for, life, than, as, an, experiment, for, examining, hypotheses, on, the, conditions, that, prevailed, prior, to, the, appearance, of, life, on, earth, although, life, itself, may, not, exist, the, prebiotic, conditions, on, titan, and, the, associated, organic, chemistry, remain, of, great, interest, in, understanding, the, early, history, of, the, terrestrial, biosphere, using, titan, as, a, prebiotic, experiment, involves, not, only, observation, through, spacecraft, but, laboratory, experiments, and, chemical, and, photochemical, modeling, on, earth, it, is, hypothesized, that, large, asteroid, and, cometary, impacts, on, earth, s, surface, may, have, caused, fragments, of, microbe, laden, rock, to, escape, earth, s, gravity, suggesting, the, possibility, of, panspermia, calculations, indicate, that, these, would, encounter, many, of, the, bodies, in, the, solar, system, including, titan, on, the, other, hand, jonathan, lunine, has, argued, that, any, living, things, in, titan, s, cryogenic, hydrocarbon, lakes, would, need, to, be, so, different, chemically, from, earth, life, that, it, would, not, be, possible, for, one, to, be, the, ancestor, of, the, other, conditions, on, titan, could, become, far, more, habitable, in, the, far, future, five, billion, years, from, now, as, the, sun, becomes, a, sub, red, giant, its, surface, temperature, could, rise, enough, for, titan, to, support, liquid, water, on, its, surface, making, it, habitable, as, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, output, decreases, the, haze, in, titan, s, upper, atmosphere, will, be, depleted, lessening, the, anti, greenhouse, effect, on, the, surface, and, enabling, the, greenhouse, created, by, atmospheric, methane, to, play, a, far, greater, role, these, conditions, together, could, create, a, habitable, environment, and, could, persist, for, several, hundred, million, years, this, is, proposed, to, have, been, sufficient, time, for, simple, life, to, spawn, on, earth, though, the, higher, viscosity, of, ammonia, water, solutions, coupled, with, low, temperatures, would, cause, chemical, reactions, to, proceed, more, slowly, on, titan
