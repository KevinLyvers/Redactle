the, triassic, t, r, a, s, k, try, ass, ik, sometimes, symbolized, is, a, geologic, period, and, system, which, spans, 50, 5, million, years, from, the, end, of, the, permian, period, 251, 902, million, years, ago, mya, to, the, beginning, of, the, jurassic, period, 201, 4, mya, the, triassic, is, the, first, and, shortest, period, of, the, mesozoic, era, both, the, start, and, end, of, the, period, are, marked, by, major, extinction, events, the, triassic, period, is, subdivided, into, three, epochs, early, triassic, middle, triassic, and, late, triassic, the, triassic, began, in, the, wake, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, which, left, the, earth, s, biosphere, impoverished, it, was, well, into, the, middle, of, the, triassic, before, life, recovered, its, former, diversity, three, categories, of, organisms, can, be, distinguished, in, the, triassic, record, survivors, from, the, extinction, event, new, groups, that, flourished, briefly, and, other, new, groups, that, went, on, to, dominate, the, mesozoic, era, reptiles, especially, archosaurs, were, the, chief, terrestrial, vertebrates, during, this, time, a, specialized, group, of, archosaurs, called, dinosaurs, first, appeared, in, the, late, triassic, but, did, not, become, dominant, until, the, succeeding, jurassic, period, archosaurs, that, became, dominant, in, this, period, were, primarily, pseudosuchians, relatives, and, ancestors, of, modern, crocodilians, while, some, archosaurs, specialized, in, flight, the, first, time, among, vertebrates, becoming, the, pterosaurs, therapsids, the, dominant, vertebrates, of, the, preceding, permian, period, declined, throughout, the, period, the, first, true, mammals, themselves, a, specialized, subgroup, of, therapsids, also, evolved, during, this, period, the, vast, supercontinent, of, pangaea, dominated, the, globe, during, the, triassic, but, in, the, latest, triassic, rhaetian, and, early, jurassic, it, began, to, gradually, rift, into, two, separate, landmasses, laurasia, to, the, north, and, gondwana, to, the, south, the, global, climate, during, the, triassic, was, mostly, hot, and, dry, with, deserts, spanning, much, of, pangaea, s, interior, however, the, climate, shifted, and, became, more, humid, as, pangaea, began, to, drift, apart, the, end, of, the, period, was, marked, by, yet, another, major, mass, extinction, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, that, wiped, out, many, groups, including, most, pseudosuchians, and, allowed, dinosaurs, to, assume, dominance, in, the, jurassic, the, triassic, was, named, in, 1834, by, friedrich, august, von, alberti, after, a, succession, of, three, distinct, rock, layers, greek, tri, s, meaning, triad, that, are, widespread, in, southern, germany, the, lower, buntsandstein, colourful, sandstone, the, middle, muschelkalk, shell, bearing, limestone, and, the, upper, keuper, coloured, clay, on, the, geologic, time, scale, the, triassic, is, usually, divided, into, early, middle, and, late, triassic, epochs, and, the, corresponding, rocks, are, referred, to, as, lower, middle, or, upper, triassic, the, faunal, stages, from, the, youngest, to, oldest, are, during, the, triassic, almost, all, the, earth, s, land, mass, was, concentrated, into, a, single, supercontinent, pangaea, lit, entire, land, this, supercontinent, was, more, or, less, centered, on, the, equator, and, extended, between, the, poles, though, it, did, drift, northwards, as, the, period, progressed, southern, pangea, also, known, as, gondwana, was, made, up, by, closely, appressed, cratons, corresponding, to, modern, south, america, africa, madagascar, india, antarctica, and, australia, north, pangea, also, known, as, laurussia, or, laurasia, corresponds, to, modern, day, north, america, and, the, fragmented, predecessors, of, eurasia, the, western, edge, of, pangea, lay, at, the, margin, of, an, enormous, ocean, panthalassa, lit, entire, sea, which, roughly, corresponds, to, the, modern, pacific, ocean, practically, all, deep, ocean, crust, present, during, the, triassic, has, been, recycled, through, the, subduction, of, oceanic, plates, so, very, little, is, known, about, the, open, ocean, from, this, time, period, most, information, on, panthalassan, geology, and, marine, life, is, derived, from, island, arcs, and, rare, seafloor, sediments, accreted, onto, surrounding, land, masses, such, as, present, day, japan, and, western, north, america, the, eastern, edge, of, pangea, was, encroached, upon, by, a, pair, of, extensive, oceanic, basins, the, neo, tethys, or, simply, tethys, and, paleo, tethys, oceans, these, extended, from, china, to, iberia, hosting, abundant, marine, life, along, their, shallow, tropical, peripheries, they, were, divided, from, each, other, by, a, long, string, of, microcontinents, known, as, the, cimmerian, terranes, cimmerian, crust, had, detached, from, gondwana, in, the, early, permian, and, drifted, northwards, during, the, triassic, enlarging, the, neo, tethys, ocean, which, formed, in, their, wake, at, the, same, time, they, forced, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, to, shrink, as, it, was, being, subducted, under, asia, by, the, end, of, the, triassic, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, occupied, a, small, area, and, the, cimmerian, terranes, began, to, collide, with, southern, asia, this, collision, known, as, the, cimmerian, orogeny, continued, into, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, to, produce, a, chain, of, mountain, ranges, stretching, from, turkey, to, malaysia, pangaea, was, fractured, by, widespread, faulting, and, rift, basins, during, the, triassic, especially, late, in, that, period, but, had, not, yet, separated, the, first, nonmarine, sediments, in, the, rift, that, marks, the, initial, break, up, of, pangaea, which, separated, eastern, north, america, from, morocco, are, of, late, triassic, age, in, the, united, states, these, thick, sediments, comprise, the, newark, supergroup, rift, basins, are, also, common, in, south, america, europe, and, africa, terrestrial, environments, are, particularly, well, represented, in, the, south, africa, russia, central, europe, and, the, southwest, united, states, terrestrial, triassic, biostratigraphy, is, mostly, based, on, terrestrial, and, freshwater, tetrapods, as, well, as, conchostracans, clam, shrimps, a, type, of, fast, breeding, crustacean, which, lived, in, lakes, and, hypersaline, environments, because, a, supercontinent, has, less, shoreline, compared, to, a, series, of, smaller, continents, triassic, marine, deposits, are, relatively, uncommon, on, a, global, scale, a, major, exception, is, in, western, europe, where, the, triassic, was, first, studied, the, northeastern, margin, of, gondwana, was, a, stable, passive, margin, along, the, neo, tethys, ocean, and, marine, sediments, have, been, preserved, in, parts, of, northern, india, and, arabia, in, north, america, marine, deposits, are, limited, to, a, few, exposures, in, the, west, during, the, triassic, peneplains, are, thought, to, have, formed, in, what, is, now, norway, and, southern, sweden, remnants, of, this, peneplain, can, be, traced, as, a, tilted, summit, accordance, in, the, swedish, west, coast, in, northern, norway, triassic, peneplains, may, have, been, buried, in, sediments, to, be, then, re, exposed, as, coastal, plains, called, strandflats, dating, of, illite, clay, from, a, strandflat, of, b, mlo, southern, norway, have, shown, that, landscape, there, became, weathered, in, late, triassic, times, c, 210, million, years, ago, with, the, landscape, likely, also, being, shaped, during, that, time, eustatic, sea, level, in, the, triassic, was, consistently, low, compared, to, the, other, geological, periods, the, beginning, of, the, triassic, was, around, present, sea, level, rising, to, about, 10, 20, metres, 33, 66, ft, above, present, day, sea, level, during, the, early, and, middle, triassic, sea, level, rise, accelerated, in, the, ladinian, culminating, with, a, sea, level, up, to, 50, metres, 164, ft, above, present, day, levels, during, the, carnian, sea, level, began, to, decline, in, the, norian, reaching, a, low, of, 50, metres, 164, ft, below, present, sea, level, during, the, mid, rhaetian, low, global, sea, levels, persisted, into, the, earliest, jurassic, the, long, term, sea, level, trend, is, superimposed, by, 22, sea, level, drop, events, widespread, in, the, geologic, record, mostly, of, minor, less, than, 25, metre, 82, ft, and, medium, 25, 75, metre, 82, 246, ft, magnitudes, a, lack, of, evidence, for, triassic, continental, ice, sheets, suggest, that, glacial, eustasy, is, unlikely, to, be, the, cause, of, these, changes, the, triassic, continental, interior, climate, was, generally, hot, and, dry, so, that, typical, deposits, are, red, bed, sandstones, and, evaporites, there, is, no, evidence, of, glaciation, at, or, near, either, pole, in, fact, the, polar, regions, were, apparently, moist, and, temperate, providing, a, climate, suitable, for, forests, and, vertebrates, including, reptiles, pangaea, s, large, size, limited, the, moderating, effect, of, the, global, ocean, its, continental, climate, was, highly, seasonal, with, very, hot, summers, and, cold, winters, the, strong, contrast, between, the, pangea, supercontinent, and, the, global, ocean, triggered, intense, cross, equatorial, monsoons, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, pangean, megamonsoons, the, triassic, may, have, mostly, been, a, dry, period, but, evidence, exists, that, it, was, punctuated, by, several, episodes, of, increased, rainfall, in, tropical, and, subtropical, latitudes, of, the, tethys, sea, and, its, surrounding, land, sediments, and, fossils, suggestive, of, a, more, humid, climate, are, known, from, the, anisian, to, ladinian, of, the, tethysian, domain, and, from, the, carnian, and, rhaetian, of, a, larger, area, that, includes, also, the, boreal, domain, e, g, svalbard, islands, the, north, american, continent, the, south, china, block, and, argentina, the, best, studied, of, such, episodes, of, humid, climate, and, probably, the, most, intense, and, widespread, was, the, carnian, pluvial, event, the, early, triassic, was, the, hottest, portion, of, the, entire, phanerozoic, seeing, as, it, occurred, during, and, immediately, after, the, discharge, of, titanic, volumes, of, greenhouse, gases, from, the, siberian, traps, the, early, triassic, began, with, the, permian, triassic, thermal, maximum, pttm, and, was, followed, by, the, brief, dienerian, cooling, dc, from, 251, to, 249, ma, which, was, in, turn, followed, by, the, latest, smithian, thermal, maximum, lstt, around, 249, to, 248, ma, during, the, latest, olenekian, cooling, loc, from, 248, to, 247, ma, temperatures, cooled, by, about, 6, c, the, middle, triassic, was, cooler, than, the, early, triassic, with, temperatures, falling, over, most, of, the, anisian, with, the, exception, of, a, warming, spike, in, the, latter, portion, of, the, stage, from, 242, to, 233, ma, the, ladinian, carnian, cooling, lcc, ensued, at, the, beginning, of, the, carnian, global, temperatures, continued, to, be, relatively, cool, the, eruption, of, the, wrangellia, large, igneous, province, around, 234, ma, caused, abrupt, global, warming, terminating, the, cooling, trend, of, the, lcc, this, warming, was, responsible, for, the, carnian, pluvial, event, and, resulted, in, an, episode, of, widespread, global, humidity, the, cpe, ushered, in, the, mid, carnian, warm, interval, mcwi, which, lasted, from, 234, to, 227, ma, at, the, carnian, norian, boundary, occurred, a, positive, 13, c, excursion, believed, to, signify, an, increase, in, organic, carbon, burial, from, 227, to, 217, ma, there, was, a, relatively, cool, period, known, as, the, early, norian, cool, interval, enci, after, which, occurred, the, mid, norian, warm, interval, mnwi, from, 217, to, 209, ma, the, mnwi, was, briefly, interrupted, around, 214, ma, by, a, cooling, possibly, related, to, the, manicouagan, impact, around, 212, ma, a, 10, myr, eccentricity, maximum, caused, a, paludification, of, pangaea, and, a, reduction, in, the, size, of, arid, climatic, zones, the, rhaetian, cool, interval, rci, lasted, from, 209, to, 201, ma, at, the, terminus, of, the, triassic, there, was, an, extreme, warming, event, referred, to, as, the, end, triassic, thermal, event, ette, which, was, responsible, for, the, triassic, jurassic, mass, extinction, bubbles, of, carbon, dioxide, in, basaltic, rocks, dating, back, to, the, end, of, the, triassic, indicate, that, volcanic, activity, from, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, helped, trigger, climate, change, in, the, ette, during, the, early, triassic, lycophytes, particularly, those, of, the, order, isoetales, which, contains, living, quillworts, rose, to, prominence, due, to, the, environmental, instability, following, the, permian, triassic, extinction, with, one, particularly, notable, example, being, the, genus, pleuromeia, which, grew, in, columnar, like, fashion, sometimes, reaching, a, height, of, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, the, relevance, of, lycophytes, declined, from, the, middle, triassic, onwards, following, the, return, of, more, stable, environmental, conditions, while, having, first, appeared, during, the, permian, the, extinct, seed, plant, group, bennettitales, first, became, a, prominent, element, in, global, floras, during, the, late, triassic, a, position, they, would, hold, for, much, of, the, mesozoic, in, the, southern, hemisphere, landmasses, of, gondwana, the, tree, dicroidium, an, extinct, seed, fern, belong, to, the, order, corystospermales, was, a, dominant, element, in, forest, habitats, across, the, region, during, the, middle, late, triassic, during, the, late, triassic, the, ginkgoales, which, today, are, represented, by, only, a, single, species, ginkgo, biloba, underwent, considerable, diversification, conifers, were, abundant, during, the, triassic, and, included, the, voltziales, which, contains, various, lineages, probably, including, those, ancestral, to, modern, conifers, as, well, as, the, extinct, family, cheirolepidiaceae, which, first, appeared, in, the, late, triassic, and, would, be, prominent, throughout, most, of, the, rest, of, the, mesozoic, no, known, coal, deposits, date, from, the, start, of, the, triassic, period, this, is, known, as, the, early, triassic, coal, gap, and, can, be, seen, as, part, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, possible, explanations, for, the, coal, gap, include, sharp, drops, in, sea, level, at, the, time, of, the, permo, triassic, boundary, acid, rain, from, the, siberian, traps, eruptions, or, from, an, impact, event, that, overwhelmed, acidic, swamps, climate, shift, to, a, greenhouse, climate, that, was, too, hot, and, dry, for, peat, accumulation, evolution, of, fungi, or, herbivores, that, were, more, destructive, of, wetlands, the, extinction, of, all, plants, adapted, to, peat, swamps, with, a, hiatus, of, several, million, years, before, new, plant, species, evolved, that, were, adapted, to, peat, swamps, or, soil, anoxia, as, oxygen, levels, plummeted, before, the, permian, extinction, archaeplastida, red, and, green, algae, had, been, the, major, marine, phytoplanktons, since, about, 659, 645, million, years, ago, when, they, replaced, marine, planktonic, cyanobacteria, which, first, appeared, about, 800, million, years, ago, as, the, dominant, phytoplankton, in, the, oceans, in, the, triassic, secondary, endosymbiotic, algae, became, the, most, important, plankton, in, marine, environments, new, modern, types, of, corals, appeared, in, the, early, triassic, forming, small, patches, of, reefs, of, modest, extent, compared, to, the, great, reef, systems, of, devonian, or, modern, times, at, the, end, of, the, carnian, a, reef, crisis, occurred, in, south, china, serpulids, appeared, in, the, middle, triassic, microconchids, were, abundant, the, shelled, cephalopods, called, ammonites, recovered, diversifying, from, a, single, line, that, survived, the, permian, extinction, bivalves, began, to, rapidly, diversify, during, the, middle, triassic, becoming, highly, abundant, in, the, oceans, aquatic, insects, rapidly, diversified, during, the, middle, triassic, with, this, time, interval, representing, a, crucial, diversification, for, holometabola, the, clade, containing, the, majority, of, modern, insect, species, in, the, wake, of, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, event, the, fish, fauna, was, remarkably, uniform, with, many, families, and, genera, exhibiting, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, coelacanths, show, their, highest, post, devonian, diversity, in, the, early, triassic, ray, finned, fishes, actinopterygians, went, through, a, remarkable, diversification, in, the, beginning, of, the, triassic, leading, to, peak, diversity, during, the, middle, triassic, however, the, pattern, of, this, diversification, is, still, not, well, understood, due, to, a, taphonomic, megabias, the, first, stem, group, teleosts, appeared, during, the, triassic, teleosts, are, by, far, the, most, diverse, group, of, fish, today, predatory, actinopterygians, such, as, saurichthyids, and, birgeriids, some, of, which, grew, over, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, in, length, appeared, in, the, early, triassic, and, became, widespread, and, successful, during, the, period, as, a, whole, lakes, and, rivers, were, populated, by, lungfish, dipnoi, such, as, ceratodus, which, are, mainly, known, from, the, dental, plates, abundant, in, the, fossils, record, hybodonts, a, group, of, shark, like, cartilaginous, fish, were, dominant, in, both, freshwater, and, marine, environments, throughout, the, triassic, last, survivors, of, the, mainly, palaeozoic, eugeneodontida, are, known, from, the, early, triassic, temnospondyl, amphibians, were, among, those, groups, that, survived, the, permian, triassic, extinction, once, abundant, in, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, environments, the, terrestrial, species, had, mostly, died, out, during, the, extinction, event, the, triassic, survivors, were, aquatic, or, semi, aquatic, and, were, represented, by, tupilakosaurus, thabanchuia, branchiosauridae, and, micropholis, all, of, which, died, out, in, early, triassic, and, the, successful, stereospondyli, with, survivors, into, the, cretaceous, period, the, largest, triassic, stereospondyls, such, as, mastodonsaurus, were, up, to, 4, to, 6, metres, 13, to, 20, ft, in, length, some, lineages, e, g, trematosaurs, flourished, briefly, in, the, early, triassic, while, others, e, g, capitosaurs, remained, successful, throughout, the, whole, period, or, only, came, to, prominence, in, the, late, triassic, e, g, plagiosaurus, metoposaurs, the, first, lissamphibians, modern, amphibians, appear, in, the, triassic, with, the, progenitors, of, the, first, frogs, already, present, by, the, early, triassic, however, the, group, as, a, whole, did, not, become, common, until, the, jurassic, when, the, temnospondyls, had, become, very, rare, most, of, the, reptiliomorpha, stem, amniotes, that, gave, rise, to, the, amniotes, disappeared, in, the, triassic, but, two, water, dwelling, groups, survived, embolomeri, that, only, survived, into, the, early, part, of, the, period, and, the, chroniosuchia, which, survived, until, the, end, of, the, triassic, the, permian, triassic, extinction, devastated, terrestrial, life, biodiversity, rebounded, as, the, surviving, species, repopulated, empty, terrain, but, these, were, short, lived, diverse, communities, with, complex, food, web, structures, took, 30, million, years, to, reestablish, archosauromorph, reptiles, which, had, already, appeared, and, diversified, to, an, extent, in, the, permian, period, exploded, in, diversity, as, an, adaptive, radiation, in, response, to, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, by, the, early, triassic, several, major, archosauromorph, groups, had, appeared, long, necked, lizard, like, early, archosauromorphs, were, known, as, protorosaurs, which, is, likely, a, paraphyletic, group, rather, than, a, true, clade, tanystropheids, were, a, family, of, protorosaurs, which, elevated, their, neck, size, to, extremes, with, the, largest, genus, tanystropheus, having, a, neck, longer, than, its, body, the, protorosaur, family, sharovipterygidae, used, their, elongated, hindlimbs, for, gliding, other, archosauromorphs, such, as, rhynchosaurs, and, allokotosaurs, were, mostly, stocky, bodied, herbivores, with, specialized, jaw, structures, rhynchosaurs, barrel, gutted, herbivores, thrived, for, only, a, short, period, of, time, becoming, extinct, about, 220, million, years, ago, they, were, exceptionally, abundant, in, the, middle, of, the, triassic, as, the, primary, large, herbivores, in, many, carnian, age, ecosystems, they, sheared, plants, with, premaxillary, beaks, and, plates, along, the, upper, jaw, with, multiple, rows, of, teeth, allokotosaurs, were, iguana, like, reptiles, including, trilophosaurus, a, common, late, triassic, reptile, with, three, crowned, teeth, teraterpeton, which, had, a, long, beak, like, snout, and, shringasaurus, a, horned, herbivore, which, reached, a, body, length, of, 3, 4, metres, 9, 8, 13, 1, ft, one, group, of, archosauromorphs, the, archosauriforms, were, distinguished, by, their, active, predatory, lifestyle, with, serrated, teeth, and, upright, limb, postures, archosauriforms, were, diverse, in, the, triassic, including, various, terrestrial, and, semiaquatic, predators, of, all, shapes, and, sizes, the, large, headed, and, robust, erythrosuchids, were, among, the, dominant, carnivores, in, the, early, triassic, phytosaurs, were, a, particularly, common, group, which, prospered, during, the, late, triassic, these, long, snouted, and, semiaquatic, predators, resemble, living, crocodiles, and, probably, had, a, similar, lifestyle, hunting, for, fish, and, small, reptiles, around, the, water, s, edge, however, this, resemblance, is, only, superficial, and, is, a, prime, case, of, convergent, evolution, true, archosaurs, appeared, in, the, early, triassic, splitting, into, two, branches, avemetatarsalia, the, ancestors, to, birds, and, pseudosuchia, the, ancestors, to, crocodilians, avemetatarsalians, were, a, minor, component, of, their, ecosystems, but, eventually, produced, the, earliest, pterosaurs, and, dinosaurs, in, the, late, triassic, early, long, tailed, pterosaurs, appeared, in, the, norian, and, quickly, spread, worldwide, triassic, dinosaurs, evolved, in, the, carnian, and, include, early, sauropodomorphs, and, theropods, most, triassic, dinosaurs, were, small, predators, and, only, a, few, were, common, such, as, coelophysis, which, was, 1, to, 2, metres, 3, 3, to, 6, 6, ft, long, triassic, sauropodomorphs, primarily, inhabited, cooler, regions, of, the, world, the, large, predator, smok, was, most, likely, also, an, archosaur, but, it, is, uncertain, if, it, was, a, primitive, dinosaur, or, a, pseudosuchian, pseudosuchians, were, far, more, ecologically, dominant, in, the, triassic, including, large, herbivores, such, as, aetosaurs, large, carnivores, rauisuchians, and, the, first, crocodylomorphs, sphenosuchians, aetosaurs, were, heavily, armored, reptiles, that, were, common, during, the, last, 30, million, years, of, the, late, triassic, until, they, died, out, at, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, most, aetosaurs, were, herbivorous, and, fed, on, low, growing, plants, but, some, may, have, eaten, meat, rauisuchians, formally, known, as, paracrocodylomorphs, were, the, keystone, predators, of, most, triassic, terrestrial, ecosystems, over, 25, species, have, been, found, including, giant, quadrupedal, hunters, sleek, bipedal, omnivores, and, lumbering, beasts, with, deep, sails, on, their, backs, they, probably, occupied, the, large, predator, niche, later, filled, by, theropods, rauisuchians, were, ancestral, to, small, lightly, built, crocodylomorphs, the, only, pseudosuchians, which, survived, into, the, jurassic, there, were, many, types, of, marine, reptiles, these, included, the, sauropterygia, which, featured, pachypleurosaurus, and, nothosaurs, both, common, during, the, middle, triassic, especially, in, the, tethys, region, placodonts, the, earliest, known, herbivorous, marine, reptile, atopodentatus, and, the, first, plesiosaurs, the, first, of, the, lizardlike, thalattosauria, askeptosaurs, and, the, highly, successful, ichthyopterygians, which, appeared, in, early, triassic, seas, soon, diversified, by, the, middle, triassic, some, ichthyopterygians, were, achieving, very, large, body, masses, among, other, reptiles, the, earliest, turtles, like, proganochelys, and, proterochersis, appeared, during, the, norian, age, stage, of, the, late, triassic, period, the, lepidosauromorpha, specifically, the, sphenodontia, are, first, found, in, the, fossil, record, of, the, earlier, carnian, age, though, the, earliest, lepidosauromorphs, likely, occurred, in, the, permian, the, procolophonidae, the, last, surviving, parareptiles, were, an, important, group, of, small, lizard, like, herbivores, the, drepanosaurs, were, a, clade, of, unusual, chameleon, like, arboreal, reptiles, with, birdlike, heads, and, specialised, claws, three, therapsid, groups, survived, into, the, triassic, dicynodonts, therocephalians, and, cynodonts, the, cynodont, cynognathus, was, a, characteristic, top, predator, in, the, olenekian, and, anisian, of, gondwana, both, kannemeyeriiform, dicynodonts, and, gomphodont, cynodonts, remained, important, herbivores, during, much, of, the, period, therocephalians, included, both, large, predators, moschorhinus, and, herbivorous, forms, bauriids, until, their, extinction, midway, through, the, period, ecteniniid, cynodonts, played, a, role, as, large, sized, cursorial, predators, in, the, late, triassic, during, the, carnian, early, part, of, the, late, triassic, some, advanced, cynodonts, gave, rise, to, the, first, mammals, during, the, triassic, archosaurs, displaced, therapsids, as, the, largest, and, most, ecologically, prolific, terrestrial, amniotes, this, triassic, takeover, may, have, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, mammals, by, forcing, the, surviving, therapsids, and, their, mammaliaform, successors, to, live, as, small, mainly, nocturnal, insectivores, nocturnal, life, may, have, forced, the, mammaliaforms, to, develop, fur, and, a, higher, metabolic, rate, two, early, triassic, lagerst, tten, high, quality, fossil, beds, the, dienerian, aged, guiyang, biota, and, the, earliest, spathian, aged, paris, biota, stand, out, due, to, their, exceptional, preservation, and, diversity, they, represent, the, earliest, lagerst, tten, of, the, mesozoic, era, and, provide, insight, into, the, biotic, recovery, from, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, event, the, monte, san, giorgio, lagerst, tte, now, in, the, lake, lugano, region, of, northern, italy, and, southern, switzerland, was, in, middle, triassic, times, a, lagoon, behind, reefs, with, an, anoxic, bottom, layer, so, there, were, no, scavengers, and, little, turbulence, to, disturb, fossilization, a, situation, that, can, be, compared, to, the, better, known, jurassic, solnhofen, limestone, lagerst, tte, the, remains, of, fish, and, various, marine, reptiles, including, the, common, pachypleurosaur, neusticosaurus, and, the, bizarre, long, necked, archosauromorph, tanystropheus, along, with, some, terrestrial, forms, like, ticinosuchus, and, macrocnemus, have, been, recovered, from, this, locality, all, these, fossils, date, from, the, anisian, and, ladinian, ages, about, 242, ma, ago, the, triassic, period, ended, with, a, mass, extinction, which, was, particularly, severe, in, the, oceans, the, conodonts, disappeared, as, did, all, the, marine, reptiles, except, ichthyosaurs, and, plesiosaurs, invertebrates, like, brachiopods, and, molluscs, such, as, gastropods, were, severely, affected, in, the, oceans, 22, of, marine, families, and, possibly, about, half, of, marine, genera, went, missing, though, the, end, triassic, extinction, event, was, not, equally, devastating, in, all, terrestrial, ecosystems, several, important, clades, of, crurotarsans, large, archosaurian, reptiles, previously, grouped, together, as, the, thecodonts, disappeared, as, did, most, of, the, large, labyrinthodont, amphibians, groups, of, small, reptiles, and, most, synapsids, some, of, the, early, primitive, dinosaurs, also, became, extinct, but, more, adaptive, ones, survived, to, evolve, into, the, jurassic, surviving, plants, that, went, on, to, dominate, the, mesozoic, world, included, modern, conifers, and, cycadeoids, the, cause, of, the, late, triassic, extinction, is, uncertain, it, was, accompanied, by, huge, volcanic, eruptions, that, occurred, as, the, supercontinent, pangaea, began, to, break, apart, about, 202, to, 191, million, years, ago, 40ar, 39ar, dates, forming, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, camp, one, of, the, largest, known, inland, volcanic, events, since, the, planet, had, first, cooled, and, stabilized, other, possible, but, less, likely, causes, for, the, extinction, events, include, global, cooling, or, even, a, bolide, impact, for, which, an, impact, crater, containing, manicouagan, reservoir, in, quebec, canada, has, been, singled, out, however, the, manicouagan, impact, melt, has, been, dated, to, 214, 1, mya, the, date, of, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, has, also, been, more, accurately, fixed, recently, at, 201, 4, mya, both, dates, are, gaining, accuracy, by, using, more, accurate, forms, of, radiometric, dating, in, particular, the, decay, of, uranium, to, lead, in, zircons, formed, at, time, of, the, impact, so, the, evidence, suggests, the, manicouagan, impact, preceded, the, end, of, the, triassic, by, approximately, 10, 2, ma, it, could, not, therefore, be, the, immediate, cause, of, the, observed, mass, extinction, the, number, of, late, triassic, extinctions, is, disputed, some, studies, suggest, that, there, are, at, least, two, periods, of, extinction, towards, the, end, of, the, triassic, separated, by, 12, to, 17, million, years, but, arguing, against, this, is, a, recent, study, of, north, american, faunas, in, the, petrified, forest, of, northeast, arizona, there, is, a, unique, sequence, of, late, carnian, early, norian, terrestrial, sediments, an, analysis, in, 2002, found, no, significant, change, in, the, paleoenvironment, phytosaurs, the, most, common, fossils, there, experienced, a, change, over, only, at, the, genus, level, and, the, number, of, species, remained, the, same, some, aetosaurs, the, next, most, common, tetrapods, and, early, dinosaurs, passed, through, unchanged, however, both, phytosaurs, and, aetosaurs, were, among, the, groups, of, archosaur, reptiles, completely, wiped, out, by, the, end, triassic, extinction, event, it, seems, likely, then, that, there, was, some, sort, of, end, carnian, extinction, when, several, herbivorous, archosauromorph, groups, died, out, while, the, large, herbivorous, therapsids, the, kannemeyeriid, dicynodonts, and, the, traversodont, cynodonts, were, much, reduced, in, the, northern, half, of, pangaea, laurasia, these, extinctions, within, the, triassic, and, at, its, end, allowed, the, dinosaurs, to, expand, into, many, niches, that, had, become, unoccupied, dinosaurs, became, increasingly, dominant, abundant, and, diverse, and, remained, that, way, for, the, next, 150, million, years, the, true, age, of, dinosaurs, is, during, the, following, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, rather, than, the, triassic
