a, natural, satellite, is, in, the, most, common, usage, an, astronomical, body, that, orbits, a, planet, dwarf, planet, or, small, solar, system, body, or, sometimes, another, natural, satellite, natural, satellites, are, colloquially, referred, to, as, moons, a, derivation, from, the, moon, of, earth, in, the, solar, system, there, are, six, planetary, satellite, systems, containing, 288, known, natural, satellites, altogether, seven, objects, commonly, considered, dwarf, planets, by, astronomers, are, also, known, to, have, natural, satellites, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, makemake, gonggong, and, eris, as, of, january, 2022, there, are, 447, other, minor, planets, known, to, have, natural, satellites, a, planet, usually, has, at, least, around, 10, 000, times, the, mass, of, any, natural, satellites, that, orbit, it, with, a, correspondingly, much, larger, diameter, the, earth, moon, system, is, a, unique, exception, in, the, solar, system, at, 3, 474, kilometres, 2, 158, miles, across, the, moon, is, 0, 273, times, the, diameter, of, earth, and, about, 1, 80, of, its, mass, the, next, largest, ratios, are, the, neptune, triton, system, at, 0, 055, with, a, mass, ratio, of, about, 1, to, 4790, the, saturn, titan, system, at, 0, 044, with, the, second, mass, ratio, next, to, the, earth, moon, system, 1, to, 4220, the, jupiter, ganymede, system, at, 0, 038, and, the, uranus, titania, system, at, 0, 031, for, the, category, of, dwarf, planets, charon, has, the, largest, ratio, being, 0, 52, the, diameter, and, 12, 2, the, mass, of, pluto, the, first, known, natural, satellite, was, the, moon, but, it, was, considered, a, planet, until, copernicus, introduction, of, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, in, 1543, until, the, discovery, of, the, galilean, satellites, in, 1610, there, was, no, opportunity, for, referring, to, such, objects, as, a, class, galileo, chose, to, refer, to, his, discoveries, as, planet, planets, but, later, discoverers, chose, other, terms, to, distinguish, them, from, the, objects, they, orbited, the, first, to, use, the, term, satellite, to, describe, orbiting, bodies, was, the, german, astronomer, johannes, kepler, in, his, pamphlet, narratio, de, observatis, a, se, quatuor, iouis, satellitibus, erronibus, narration, about, four, satellites, of, jupiter, observed, in, 1610, he, derived, the, term, from, the, latin, word, satelles, meaning, guard, attendant, or, companion, because, the, satellites, accompanied, their, primary, planet, in, their, journey, through, the, heavens, the, term, satellite, thus, became, the, normal, one, for, referring, to, an, object, orbiting, a, planet, as, it, avoided, the, ambiguity, of, moon, in, 1957, however, the, launching, of, the, artificial, object, sputnik, created, a, need, for, new, terminology, the, terms, man, made, satellite, and, artificial, moon, were, very, quickly, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, simpler, satellite, and, as, a, consequence, the, term, has, become, linked, primarily, with, artificial, objects, flown, in, space, because, of, this, shift, in, meaning, the, term, moon, which, had, continued, to, be, used, in, a, generic, sense, in, works, of, popular, science, and, fiction, has, regained, respectability, and, is, now, used, interchangeably, with, natural, satellite, even, in, scientific, articles, when, it, is, necessary, to, avoid, both, the, ambiguity, of, confusion, with, earth, s, natural, satellite, the, moon, and, the, natural, satellites, of, the, other, planets, on, the, one, hand, and, artificial, satellites, on, the, other, the, term, natural, satellite, using, natural, in, a, sense, opposed, to, artificial, is, used, to, further, avoid, ambiguity, the, convention, is, to, capitalize, the, word, moon, when, referring, to, earth, s, natural, satellite, a, proper, noun, but, not, when, referring, to, other, natural, satellites, common, nouns, many, authors, define, satellite, or, natural, satellite, as, orbiting, some, planet, or, minor, planet, synonymous, with, moon, by, such, a, definition, all, natural, satellites, are, moons, but, earth, and, other, planets, are, not, satellites, a, few, recent, authors, define, moon, as, a, satellite, of, a, planet, or, minor, planet, and, planet, as, a, satellite, of, a, star, such, authors, consider, earth, as, a, natural, satellite, of, the, sun, there, is, no, established, lower, limit, on, what, is, considered, a, moon, every, natural, celestial, body, with, an, identified, orbit, around, a, planet, of, the, solar, system, some, as, small, as, a, kilometer, across, has, been, considered, a, moon, though, objects, a, tenth, that, size, within, saturn, s, rings, which, have, not, been, directly, observed, have, been, called, moonlets, small, asteroid, moons, natural, satellites, of, asteroids, such, as, dactyl, have, also, been, called, moonlets, the, upper, limit, is, also, vague, two, orbiting, bodies, are, sometimes, described, as, a, double, planet, rather, than, primary, and, satellite, asteroids, such, as, 90, antiope, are, considered, double, asteroids, but, they, have, not, forced, a, clear, definition, of, what, constitutes, a, moon, some, authors, consider, the, pluto, charon, system, to, be, a, double, dwarf, planet, the, most, common, dividing, line, on, what, is, considered, a, moon, rests, upon, whether, the, barycentre, is, below, the, surface, of, the, larger, body, though, this, is, somewhat, arbitrary, because, it, depends, on, distance, as, well, as, relative, mass, the, natural, satellites, orbiting, relatively, close, to, the, planet, on, prograde, uninclined, circular, orbits, regular, satellites, are, generally, thought, to, have, been, formed, out, of, the, same, collapsing, region, of, the, protoplanetary, disk, that, created, its, primary, in, contrast, irregular, satellites, generally, orbiting, on, distant, inclined, eccentric, and, or, retrograde, orbits, are, thought, to, be, captured, asteroids, possibly, further, fragmented, by, collisions, most, of, the, major, natural, satellites, of, the, solar, system, have, regular, orbits, while, most, of, the, small, natural, satellites, have, irregular, orbits, the, moon, and, the, moons, of, pluto, are, exceptions, among, large, bodies, in, that, they, are, thought, to, have, originated, from, the, collision, of, two, large, protoplanetary, objects, early, in, the, solar, system, s, history, see, the, giant, impact, hypothesis, the, material, that, would, have, been, placed, in, orbit, around, the, central, body, is, predicted, to, have, reaccreted, to, form, one, or, more, orbiting, natural, satellites, as, opposed, to, planetary, sized, bodies, asteroid, moons, are, thought, to, commonly, form, by, this, process, triton, is, another, exception, although, large, and, in, a, close, circular, orbit, its, motion, is, retrograde, and, it, is, thought, to, be, a, captured, dwarf, planet, the, capture, of, an, asteroid, from, a, heliocentric, orbit, is, not, always, permanent, according, to, simulations, temporary, satellites, should, be, a, common, phenomenon, the, only, observed, examples, are, 1991, vg, 2006, rh, 120, 2020, cd, 3, 2006, rh, 120, was, a, temporary, satellite, of, earth, for, nine, months, in, 2006, and, 2007, most, regular, moons, natural, satellites, following, relatively, close, and, prograde, orbits, with, small, orbital, inclination, and, eccentricity, in, the, solar, system, are, tidally, locked, to, their, respective, primaries, meaning, that, the, same, side, of, the, natural, satellite, always, faces, its, planet, this, phenomenon, comes, about, through, a, loss, of, energy, due, to, tidal, forces, raised, by, the, planet, slowing, the, rotation, of, the, satellite, until, it, is, negligible, exceptions, are, known, one, such, exception, is, saturn, s, natural, satellite, hyperion, which, rotates, chaotically, because, of, the, gravitational, influence, of, titan, pluto, s, four, circumbinary, small, moons, also, rotate, chaotically, due, to, charon, s, influence, in, contrast, the, outer, natural, satellites, of, the, giant, planets, irregular, satellites, are, too, far, away, to, have, become, locked, for, example, jupiter, s, himalia, saturn, s, phoebe, and, neptune, s, nereid, have, rotation, periods, in, the, range, of, ten, hours, whereas, their, orbital, periods, are, hundreds, of, days, no, moons, of, moons, or, subsatellites, natural, satellites, that, orbit, a, natural, satellite, of, a, planet, are, currently, known, in, most, cases, the, tidal, effects, of, the, planet, would, make, such, a, system, unstable, however, calculations, performed, after, the, 2008, detection, of, a, possible, ring, system, around, saturn, s, moon, rhea, indicate, that, satellites, orbiting, rhea, could, have, stable, orbits, furthermore, the, suspected, rings, are, thought, to, be, narrow, a, phenomenon, normally, associated, with, shepherd, moons, however, targeted, images, taken, by, the, cassini, spacecraft, failed, to, detect, rings, around, rhea, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, saturn, s, moon, iapetus, had, a, satellite, in, the, past, this, is, one, of, several, hypotheses, that, have, been, put, forward, to, account, for, its, equatorial, ridge, light, curve, analysis, suggests, that, saturn, s, irregular, satellite, kiviuq, is, extremely, prolate, and, is, likely, a, contact, binary, or, even, a, binary, moon, two, natural, satellites, are, known, to, have, small, companions, at, both, their, l, 4, and, l, 5, lagrangian, points, sixty, degrees, ahead, and, behind, the, body, in, its, orbit, these, companions, are, called, trojan, moons, as, their, orbits, are, analogous, to, the, trojan, asteroids, of, jupiter, the, trojan, moons, are, telesto, and, calypso, which, are, the, leading, and, following, companions, respectively, of, the, saturnian, moon, tethys, and, helene, and, polydeuces, the, leading, and, following, companions, of, the, saturnian, moon, dione, the, discovery, of, 243, ida, s, natural, satellite, dactyl, in, the, early, 1990s, confirmed, that, some, asteroids, have, natural, satellites, indeed, 87, sylvia, has, two, some, such, as, 90, antiope, are, double, asteroids, with, two, comparably, sized, components, neptune, s, moon, proteus, is, the, largest, irregularly, shaped, natural, satellite, the, shapes, of, eris, moon, dysnomia, and, orcus, moon, vanth, are, unknown, all, other, known, natural, satellites, that, are, at, least, the, size, of, uranus, s, miranda, have, lapsed, into, rounded, ellipsoids, under, hydrostatic, equilibrium, i, e, are, round, rounded, satellites, and, are, sometimes, categorized, as, planetary, mass, moons, dysnomia, s, density, is, known, to, be, high, enough, that, it, is, probably, a, solid, ellipsoid, as, well, the, larger, natural, satellites, being, tidally, locked, tend, toward, ovoid, egg, like, shapes, squat, at, their, poles, and, with, longer, equatorial, axes, in, the, direction, of, their, primaries, their, planets, than, in, the, direction, of, their, motion, saturn, s, moon, mimas, for, example, has, a, major, axis, 9, greater, than, its, polar, axis, and, 5, greater, than, its, other, equatorial, axis, methone, another, of, saturn, s, moons, is, only, around, 3, km, in, diameter, and, visibly, egg, shaped, the, effect, is, smaller, on, the, largest, natural, satellites, where, their, gravity, is, greater, relative, to, the, effects, of, tidal, distortion, especially, those, that, orbit, less, massive, planets, or, as, in, the, case, of, the, moon, at, greater, distances, of, the, twenty, known, natural, satellites, in, the, solar, system, that, are, large, enough, to, be, gravitationally, rounded, several, remain, geologically, active, today, io, is, the, most, volcanically, active, body, in, the, solar, system, while, europa, enceladus, titan, and, triton, display, evidence, of, ongoing, tectonic, activity, and, cryovolcanism, in, the, first, three, cases, the, geological, activity, is, powered, by, the, tidal, heating, resulting, from, having, eccentric, orbits, close, to, their, giant, planet, primaries, this, mechanism, would, have, also, operated, on, triton, in, the, past, before, its, orbit, was, circularized, many, other, natural, satellites, such, as, earth, s, moon, ganymede, tethys, and, miranda, show, evidence, of, past, geological, activity, resulting, from, energy, sources, such, as, the, decay, of, their, primordial, radioisotopes, greater, past, orbital, eccentricities, due, in, some, cases, to, past, orbital, resonances, or, the, differentiation, or, freezing, of, their, interiors, enceladus, and, triton, both, have, active, features, resembling, geysers, although, in, the, case, of, triton, solar, heating, appears, to, provide, the, energy, titan, and, triton, have, significant, atmospheres, titan, also, has, hydrocarbon, lakes, all, four, of, the, galilean, moons, have, atmospheres, though, they, are, extremely, thin, four, of, the, largest, natural, satellites, europa, ganymede, callisto, and, titan, are, thought, to, have, subsurface, oceans, of, liquid, water, while, smaller, enceladus, also, supports, a, global, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, water, besides, planets, and, dwarf, planets, objects, within, our, solar, system, known, to, have, natural, satellites, are, 76, in, the, asteroid, belt, five, with, two, each, four, jupiter, trojans, 39, near, earth, objects, two, with, two, satellites, each, and, 14, mars, crossers, there, are, also, 84, known, natural, satellites, of, trans, neptunian, objects, some, 150, additional, small, bodies, have, been, observed, within, the, rings, of, saturn, but, only, a, few, were, tracked, long, enough, to, establish, orbits, planets, around, other, stars, are, likely, to, have, satellites, as, well, and, although, numerous, candidates, have, been, detected, to, date, none, have, yet, been, confirmed, of, the, inner, planets, mercury, and, venus, have, no, natural, satellites, earth, has, one, large, natural, satellite, known, as, the, moon, and, mars, has, two, tiny, natural, satellites, phobos, and, deimos, the, giant, planets, have, extensive, systems, of, natural, satellites, including, half, a, dozen, comparable, in, size, to, earth, s, moon, the, four, galilean, moons, saturn, s, titan, and, neptune, s, triton, saturn, has, an, additional, six, mid, sized, natural, satellites, massive, enough, to, have, achieved, hydrostatic, equilibrium, and, uranus, has, five, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, satellites, may, potentially, harbour, life, among, the, objects, generally, agreed, by, astronomers, to, be, dwarf, planets, ceres, and, sedna, have, no, known, natural, satellites, pluto, has, the, relatively, large, natural, satellite, charon, and, four, smaller, natural, satellites, styx, nix, kerberos, and, hydra, haumea, has, two, natural, satellites, orcus, quaoar, makemake, gonggong, and, eris, have, one, each, the, pluto, charon, system, is, unusual, in, that, the, center, of, mass, lies, in, open, space, between, the, two, a, characteristic, sometimes, associated, with, a, double, planet, system, the, seven, largest, natural, satellites, in, the, solar, system, those, bigger, than, 2, 500, km, across, are, jupiter, s, galilean, moons, ganymede, callisto, io, and, europa, saturn, s, moon, titan, earth, s, moon, and, neptune, s, captured, natural, satellite, triton, triton, the, smallest, of, these, has, more, mass, than, all, smaller, natural, satellites, together, similarly, in, the, next, size, group, of, nine, mid, sized, natural, satellites, between, 1, 000, km, and, 1, 600, km, across, titania, oberon, rhea, iapetus, charon, ariel, umbriel, dione, and, tethys, the, smallest, tethys, has, more, mass, than, all, smaller, natural, satellites, together, as, well, as, the, natural, satellites, of, the, various, planets, there, are, also, over, 80, known, natural, satellites, of, the, dwarf, planets, minor, planets, and, other, small, solar, system, bodies, some, studies, estimate, that, up, to, 15, of, all, trans, neptunian, objects, could, have, satellites, the, following, is, a, comparative, table, classifying, the, natural, satellites, in, the, solar, system, by, diameter, the, column, on, the, right, includes, some, notable, planets, dwarf, planets, asteroids, and, trans, neptunian, objects, for, comparison, the, natural, satellites, of, the, planets, are, named, after, mythological, figures, these, are, predominantly, greek, except, for, the, uranian, natural, satellites, which, are, named, after, shakespearean, characters, the, twenty, satellites, massive, enough, to, be, round, are, in, bold, in, the, table, below, minor, planets, and, satellites, where, there, is, disagreement, in,
