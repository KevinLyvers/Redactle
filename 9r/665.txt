land, reclamation, often, known, as, reclamation, and, also, known, as, land, fill, not, to, be, confused, with, a, waste, landfill, is, the, process, of, creating, new, land, from, oceans, seas, riverbeds, or, lake, beds, the, land, reclaimed, is, known, as, reclamation, ground, reclaimed, land, or, land, fill, in, ancient, egypt, the, rulers, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, c, 2000, 1800, bc, undertook, a, far, sighted, land, reclamation, scheme, to, increase, agricultural, output, they, constructed, levees, and, canals, to, connect, the, faiyum, with, the, bahr, yussef, waterway, diverting, water, that, would, have, flowed, into, lake, moeris, and, causing, gradual, evaporation, around, the, lake, s, edges, creating, new, farmland, from, the, reclaimed, land, a, similar, land, reclamation, system, using, dams, and, drainage, canals, was, used, in, the, greek, copaic, basin, during, the, middle, helladic, period, c, 1900, 1600, bc, one, of, the, earliest, large, scale, projects, was, the, beemster, polder, in, the, netherlands, realized, in, 1612, adding, 70, square, kilometres, 27, sq, mi, of, land, in, hong, kong, the, praya, reclamation, scheme, added, 20, to, 24, hectares, 50, to, 60, acres, of, land, in, 1890, during, the, second, phase, of, construction, it, was, one, of, the, most, ambitious, projects, ever, taken, during, the, colonial, hong, kong, era, some, 20, of, land, in, the, tokyo, bay, area, has, been, reclaimed, most, notably, odaiba, artificial, island, the, city, of, rio, de, janeiro, was, largely, built, on, reclaimed, land, as, was, wellington, new, zealand, land, reclamation, can, be, achieved, by, a, number, of, different, methods, the, simplest, method, involves, filling, the, area, with, large, amounts, of, heavy, rock, and, or, cement, then, filling, with, clay, and, dirt, until, the, desired, height, is, reached, the, process, is, called, infilling, and, the, material, used, to, fill, the, space, is, generally, called, infill, draining, of, submerged, wetlands, is, often, used, to, reclaim, land, for, agricultural, use, deep, cement, mixing, is, used, typically, in, situations, in, which, the, material, displaced, by, either, dredging, or, draining, may, be, contaminated, and, hence, needs, to, be, contained, land, dredging, is, also, another, method, of, land, reclamation, it, is, the, removal, of, sediments, and, debris, from, the, bottom, of, a, body, of, water, it, is, commonly, used, for, maintaining, reclaimed, land, masses, as, sedimentation, a, natural, process, fills, channels, and, harbors, morocco, nigeria, south, africa, tanzania, bahrain, china, india, indonesia, japan, lebanon, maldives, malaysia, pakistan, philippines, qatar, singapore, south, korea, sri, lanka, united, arab, emirates, belarus, belgium, denmark, finland, france, greece, ireland, italy, monaco, netherlands, norway, russia, spain, turkey, united, kingdom, ukraine, bahamas, bermuda, canada, mexico, united, states, australia, fiji, new, zealand, argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, panama, uruguay, venezuela, agriculture, was, a, driver, of, land, reclamation, before, industrialisation, in, south, china, farmers, reclaimed, paddy, fields, by, enclosing, an, area, with, a, stone, wall, on, the, sea, shore, near, a, river, mouth, or, river, delta, the, species, of, rice, that, are, grown, on, these, grounds, are, more, salt, tolerant, another, use, of, such, enclosed, land, is, the, creation, of, fish, ponds, it, is, commonly, seen, on, the, pearl, river, delta, and, hong, kong, these, reclaimed, areas, also, attract, species, of, migrating, birds, a, related, practice, is, the, draining, of, swampy, or, seasonally, submerged, wetlands, to, convert, them, to, farmland, while, this, does, not, create, new, land, exactly, it, allows, commercially, productive, use, of, land, that, would, otherwise, be, restricted, to, wildlife, habitat, it, is, also, an, important, method, of, mosquito, control, even, in, the, post, industrial, age, there, have, been, land, reclamation, projects, intended, for, increasing, available, agricultural, land, for, example, the, village, of, ogata, in, akita, japan, was, established, on, land, reclaimed, from, lake, hachir, gata, japan, s, second, largest, lake, at, the, time, starting, in, 1957, by, 1977, the, amount, of, land, reclaimed, totalled, 172, 03, square, kilometres, 66, 42, sq, mi, artificial, islands, are, an, example, of, land, reclamation, creating, an, artificial, island, is, an, expensive, and, risky, undertaking, it, is, often, considered, in, places, with, high, population, density, and, a, scarcity, of, flat, land, kansai, international, airport, in, osaka, and, hong, kong, international, airport, are, examples, where, this, process, was, deemed, necessary, the, palm, islands, the, world, and, hotel, burj, al, arab, off, dubai, in, the, united, arab, emirates, are, other, examples, of, artificial, islands, although, there, is, yet, no, real, scarcity, of, land, in, dubai, as, well, as, the, flevopolder, in, the, netherlands, which, is, the, largest, artificial, island, in, the, world, beach, rebuilding, is, the, process, of, repairing, beaches, using, materials, such, as, sand, or, mud, from, inland, this, can, be, used, to, build, up, beaches, suffering, from, beach, starvation, or, erosion, from, longshore, drift, it, stops, the, movement, of, the, original, beach, material, through, longshore, drift, and, retains, a, natural, look, to, the, beach, although, it, is, not, a, long, lasting, solution, it, is, cheap, compared, to, other, types, of, coastal, defences, an, example, of, this, is, the, city, of, mumbai, as, human, overcrowding, of, developed, areas, intensified, during, the, 20th, century, it, has, become, important, to, develop, land, re, use, strategies, for, completed, landfills, some, of, the, most, common, usages, are, for, parks, golf, courses, and, other, sports, fields, increasingly, however, office, buildings, and, industrial, uses, are, made, on, a, completed, landfill, in, these, latter, uses, methane, capture, is, customarily, carried, out, to, minimize, explosive, hazard, within, the, building, an, example, of, a, class, a, office, building, constructed, over, a, landfill, is, the, dakin, building, at, sierra, point, brisbane, california, the, underlying, fill, was, deposited, from, 1965, to, 1985, mostly, consisting, of, construction, debris, from, san, francisco, and, some, municipal, wastes, aerial, photographs, prior, to, 1965, show, this, area, to, be, tidelands, of, the, san, francisco, bay, a, clay, cap, was, constructed, over, the, debris, prior, to, building, approval, a, notable, example, is, sydney, olympic, park, the, primary, venue, for, the, 2000, summer, olympic, games, which, was, built, atop, an, industrial, wasteland, that, included, landfills, another, strategy, for, landfill, is, the, incineration, of, landfill, trash, at, high, temperature, via, the, plasma, arc, gasification, process, which, is, currently, used, at, two, facilities, in, japan, and, was, proposed, to, be, used, at, a, facility, in, st, lucie, county, florida, the, planned, facility, in, florida, was, later, canceled, draining, wetlands, for, ploughing, for, example, is, a, form, of, habitat, destruction, in, some, parts, of, the, world, new, reclamation, projects, are, restricted, or, no, longer, allowed, due, to, environmental, protection, laws, reclamation, projects, have, strong, negative, impacts, on, coastal, populations, although, some, species, can, take, advantage, of, the, newly, created, area, a, 2022, global, analysis, estimated, that, 39, of, losses, approximately, 5, 300, km, 2, or, 2, 000, sq, mi, and, 14, of, gains, approximately, 1, 300, km, 2, or, 500, sq, mi, of, tidal, wetlands, mangroves, tidal, flats, and, tidal, marshes, between, 1999, 2019, were, due, to, direct, human, activities, including, conversion, to, aquaculture, agriculture, plantations, coastal, developments, and, other, physical, structures, the, state, of, california, created, a, state, commission, the, san, francisco, bay, conservation, and, development, commission, in, 1965, to, protect, san, francisco, bay, and, regulate, development, near, its, shores, the, commission, was, created, in, response, to, growing, concern, over, the, shrinking, size, of, the, bay, hong, kong, legislators, passed, the, protection, of, the, harbour, ordinance, proposed, by, the, society, for, protection, of, the, harbour, in, 1997, in, an, effort, to, safeguard, the, increasingly, threatened, victoria, harbour, against, encroaching, land, development, several, large, reclamation, schemes, at, green, island, west, kowloon, and, kowloon, bay, were, subsequently, shelved, and, others, reduced, in, size, reclaimed, land, is, highly, susceptible, to, soil, liquefaction, during, earthquakes, which, can, amplify, the, amount, of, damage, that, occurs, to, buildings, and, infrastructure, subsidence, is, another, issue, both, from, soil, compaction, on, filled, land, and, also, when, wetlands, are, enclosed, by, levees, and, drained, to, create, polders, drained, marshes, will, eventually, sink, below, the, surrounding, water, level, increasing, the, danger, from, flooding, 67, km, 2, 26, sq, mi, of, land, was, reclaimed, up, to, 2013, praya, reclamation, scheme, began, in, the, late, 1860s, and, consisted, of, two, stages, totaling, 20, to, 24, hectares, 50, to, 60, acres, hong, kong, disneyland, hong, kong, international, airport, and, its, predecessor, kai, tak, airport, were, all, built, on, reclaimed, land, in, addition, much, reclamation, has, taken, place, in, prime, locations, on, the, waterfront, on, both, sides, of, victoria, harbour, this, has, raised, environmental, issues, of, the, protection, of, the, harbour, which, was, once, the, source, of, prosperity, of, hong, kong, traffic, congestion, in, the, central, district, as, well, as, the, collusion, of, the, hong, kong, government, with, the, real, estate, developers, in, the, territory, in, addition, as, the, city, expanded, new, towns, in, different, decades, were, mostly, built, on, reclaimed, land, such, as, kwun, tong, sha, tin, ma, on, shan, tai, po, tseung, kwan, o, tuen, mun, and, west, kowloon, 20, percent, of, the, original, size, or, 135, km, 2, 52, sq, mi, as, of, 2003, plans, for, 99, km, 2, 38, sq, mi, more, are, to, go, ahead, even, though, disputes, persist, with, malaysia, over, singapore, s, extensive, land, reclamation, works, parts, of, changi, airport, are, also, on, reclaimed, land, dubai, has, a, total, of, four, reclaimed, islands, the, palm, jumeirah, jebal, ali, the, burj, al, arab, island, and, the, world, islands, with, a, fifth, under, construction, the, palm, deira, there, are, several, human, made, islands, in, abu, dhabi, such, as, yas, island, and, al, lulu, island, 0, 41, km, 2, 0, 16, sq, mi, out, of, 2, 05, km, 2, 0, 79, sq, mi, or, one, fifth, of, monaco, comes, from, land, taken, from, the, sea, mainly, in, the, neighborhoods, of, fontvieille, la, condamine, and, larvotto, bas, moulins, about, 1, 6, almost, 17, of, the, entire, country, or, about, 7, 000, km, 2, 2, 700, sq, mi, in, total, has, been, reclaimed, from, the, sea, lakes, marshes, and, swamps, the, province, of, flevoland, has, almost, completely, been, reclaimed, from, the, zuiderzee
