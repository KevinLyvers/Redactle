sedimentary, rocks, are, types, of, rock, that, are, formed, by, the, accumulation, or, deposition, of, mineral, or, organic, particles, at, earth, s, surface, followed, by, cementation, sedimentation, is, the, collective, name, for, processes, that, cause, these, particles, to, settle, in, place, the, particles, that, form, a, sedimentary, rock, are, called, sediment, and, may, be, composed, of, geological, detritus, minerals, or, biological, detritus, organic, matter, the, geological, detritus, originated, from, weathering, and, erosion, of, existing, rocks, or, from, the, solidification, of, molten, lava, blobs, erupted, by, volcanoes, the, geological, detritus, is, transported, to, the, place, of, deposition, by, water, wind, ice, or, mass, movement, which, are, called, agents, of, denudation, biological, detritus, was, formed, by, bodies, and, parts, mainly, shells, of, dead, aquatic, organisms, as, well, as, their, fecal, mass, suspended, in, water, and, slowly, piling, up, on, the, floor, of, water, bodies, marine, snow, sedimentation, may, also, occur, as, dissolved, minerals, precipitate, from, water, solution, the, sedimentary, rock, cover, of, the, continents, of, the, earth, s, crust, is, extensive, 73, of, the, earth, s, current, land, surface, but, sedimentary, rock, is, estimated, to, be, only, 8, of, the, volume, of, the, crust, sedimentary, rocks, are, only, a, thin, veneer, over, a, crust, consisting, mainly, of, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, sedimentary, rocks, are, deposited, in, layers, as, strata, forming, a, structure, called, bedding, sedimentary, rocks, are, often, deposited, in, large, structures, called, sedimentary, basins, sedimentary, rocks, have, also, been, found, on, mars, the, study, of, sedimentary, rocks, and, rock, strata, provides, information, about, the, subsurface, that, is, useful, for, civil, engineering, for, example, in, the, construction, of, roads, houses, tunnels, canals, or, other, structures, sedimentary, rocks, are, also, important, sources, of, natural, resources, including, coal, fossil, fuels, drinking, water, and, ores, the, study, of, the, sequence, of, sedimentary, rock, strata, is, the, main, source, for, an, understanding, of, the, earth, s, history, including, palaeogeography, paleoclimatology, and, the, history, of, life, the, scientific, discipline, that, studies, the, properties, and, origin, of, sedimentary, rocks, is, called, sedimentology, sedimentology, is, part, of, both, geology, and, physical, geography, and, overlaps, partly, with, other, disciplines, in, the, earth, sciences, such, as, pedology, geomorphology, geochemistry, and, structural, geology, sedimentary, rocks, can, be, subdivided, into, four, groups, based, on, the, processes, responsible, for, their, formation, clastic, sedimentary, rocks, biochemical, biogenic, sedimentary, rocks, chemical, sedimentary, rocks, and, a, fourth, category, for, other, sedimentary, rocks, formed, by, impacts, volcanism, and, other, minor, processes, clastic, sedimentary, rocks, are, composed, of, rock, fragments, clasts, that, have, been, cemented, together, the, clasts, are, commonly, individual, grains, of, quartz, feldspar, clay, minerals, or, mica, however, any, type, of, mineral, may, be, present, clasts, may, also, be, lithic, fragments, composed, of, more, than, one, mineral, clastic, sedimentary, rocks, are, subdivided, according, to, the, dominant, particle, size, most, geologists, use, the, udden, wentworth, grain, size, scale, and, divide, unconsolidated, sediment, into, three, fractions, gravel, 2, mm, diameter, sand, 1, 16, to, 2, mm, diameter, and, mud, 1, 16, mm, diameter, mud, is, further, divided, into, silt, 1, 16, to, 1, 256, mm, diameter, and, clay, 1, 256, mm, diameter, the, classification, of, clastic, sedimentary, rocks, parallels, this, scheme, conglomerates, and, breccias, are, made, mostly, of, gravel, sandstones, are, made, mostly, of, sand, and, mudrocks, are, made, mostly, of, mud, this, tripartite, subdivision, is, mirrored, by, the, broad, categories, of, rudites, arenites, and, lutites, respectively, in, older, literature, the, subdivision, of, these, three, broad, categories, is, based, on, differences, in, clast, shape, conglomerates, and, breccias, composition, sandstones, or, grain, size, or, texture, mudrocks, conglomerates, are, dominantly, composed, of, rounded, gravel, while, breccias, are, composed, of, dominantly, angular, gravel, sandstone, classification, schemes, vary, widely, but, most, geologists, have, adopted, the, dott, scheme, which, uses, the, relative, abundance, of, quartz, feldspar, and, lithic, framework, grains, and, the, abundance, of, a, muddy, matrix, between, the, larger, grains, six, sandstone, names, are, possible, using, the, descriptors, for, grain, composition, quartz, feldspathic, and, lithic, and, the, amount, of, matrix, wacke, or, arenite, for, example, a, quartz, arenite, would, be, composed, of, mostly, 90, quartz, grains, and, have, little, or, no, clayey, matrix, between, the, grains, a, lithic, wacke, would, have, abundant, lithic, grains, and, abundant, muddy, matrix, etc, although, the, dott, classification, scheme, is, widely, used, by, sedimentologists, common, names, like, greywacke, arkose, and, quartz, sandstone, are, still, widely, used, by, non, specialists, and, in, popular, literature, mudrocks, are, sedimentary, rocks, composed, of, at, least, 50, silt, and, clay, sized, particles, these, relatively, fine, grained, particles, are, commonly, transported, by, turbulent, flow, in, water, or, air, and, deposited, as, the, flow, calms, and, the, particles, settle, out, of, suspension, most, authors, presently, use, the, term, mudrock, to, refer, to, all, rocks, composed, dominantly, of, mud, mudrocks, can, be, divided, into, siltstones, composed, dominantly, of, silt, sized, particles, mudstones, with, subequal, mixture, of, silt, and, clay, sized, particles, and, claystones, composed, mostly, of, clay, sized, particles, most, authors, use, shale, as, a, term, for, a, fissile, mudrock, regardless, of, grain, size, although, some, older, literature, uses, the, term, shale, as, a, synonym, for, mudrock, biochemical, sedimentary, rocks, are, created, when, organisms, use, materials, dissolved, in, air, or, water, to, build, their, tissue, examples, include, chemical, sedimentary, rock, forms, when, mineral, constituents, in, solution, become, supersaturated, and, inorganically, precipitate, common, chemical, sedimentary, rocks, include, oolitic, limestone, and, rocks, composed, of, evaporite, minerals, such, as, halite, rock, salt, sylvite, baryte, and, gypsum, this, fourth, miscellaneous, category, includes, volcanic, tuff, and, volcanic, breccias, formed, by, deposition, and, later, cementation, of, lava, fragments, erupted, by, volcanoes, and, impact, breccias, formed, after, impact, events, alternatively, sedimentary, rocks, can, be, subdivided, into, compositional, groups, based, on, their, mineralogy, sedimentary, rocks, are, formed, when, sediment, is, deposited, out, of, air, ice, wind, gravity, or, water, flows, carrying, the, particles, in, suspension, this, sediment, is, often, formed, when, weathering, and, erosion, break, down, a, rock, into, loose, material, in, a, source, area, the, material, is, then, transported, from, the, source, area, to, the, deposition, area, the, type, of, sediment, transported, depends, on, the, geology, of, the, hinterland, the, source, area, of, the, sediment, however, some, sedimentary, rocks, such, as, evaporites, are, composed, of, material, that, form, at, the, place, of, deposition, the, nature, of, a, sedimentary, rock, therefore, not, only, depends, on, the, sediment, supply, but, also, on, the, sedimentary, depositional, environment, in, which, it, formed, as, sediments, accumulate, in, a, depositional, environment, older, sediments, are, buried, by, younger, sediments, and, they, undergo, diagenesis, diagenesis, includes, all, the, chemical, physical, and, biological, changes, exclusive, of, surface, weathering, undergone, by, a, sediment, after, its, initial, deposition, this, includes, compaction, and, lithification, of, the, sediments, early, stages, of, diagenesis, described, as, eogenesis, take, place, at, shallow, depths, a, few, tens, of, meters, and, is, characterized, by, bioturbation, and, mineralogical, changes, in, the, sediments, with, only, slight, compaction, the, red, hematite, that, gives, red, bed, sandstones, their, color, is, likely, formed, during, eogenesis, some, biochemical, processes, like, the, activity, of, bacteria, can, affect, minerals, in, a, rock, and, are, therefore, seen, as, part, of, diagenesis, deeper, burial, is, accompanied, by, mesogenesis, during, which, most, of, the, compaction, and, lithification, takes, place, compaction, takes, place, as, the, sediments, come, under, increasing, overburden, lithostatic, pressure, from, overlying, sediments, sediment, grains, move, into, more, compact, arrangements, grains, of, ductile, minerals, such, as, mica, are, deformed, and, pore, space, is, reduced, sediments, are, typically, saturated, with, groundwater, or, seawater, when, originally, deposited, and, as, pore, space, is, reduced, much, of, these, connate, fluids, are, expelled, in, addition, to, this, physical, compaction, chemical, compaction, may, take, place, via, pressure, solution, points, of, contact, between, grains, are, under, the, greatest, strain, and, the, strained, mineral, is, more, soluble, than, the, rest, of, the, grain, as, a, result, the, contact, points, are, dissolved, away, allowing, the, grains, to, come, into, closer, contact, the, increased, pressure, and, temperature, stimulate, further, chemical, reactions, such, as, the, reactions, by, which, organic, material, becomes, lignite, or, coal, lithification, follows, closely, on, compaction, as, increased, temperatures, at, depth, hasten, the, precipitation, of, cement, that, binds, the, grains, together, pressure, solution, contributes, to, this, process, of, cementation, as, the, mineral, dissolved, from, strained, contact, points, is, redeposited, in, the, unstrained, pore, spaces, this, further, reduces, porosity, and, makes, the, rock, more, compact, and, competent, unroofing, of, buried, sedimentary, rock, is, accompanied, by, telogenesis, the, third, and, final, stage, of, diagenesis, as, erosion, reduces, the, depth, of, burial, renewed, exposure, to, meteoric, water, produces, additional, changes, to, the, sedimentary, rock, such, as, leaching, of, some, of, the, cement, to, produce, secondary, porosity, at, sufficiently, high, temperature, and, pressure, the, realm, of, diagenesis, makes, way, for, metamorphism, the, process, that, forms, metamorphic, rock, the, color, of, a, sedimentary, rock, is, often, mostly, determined, by, iron, an, element, with, two, major, oxides, iron, ii, oxide, and, iron, iii, oxide, iron, ii, oxide, feo, only, forms, under, low, oxygen, anoxic, circumstances, and, gives, the, rock, a, grey, or, greenish, colour, iron, iii, oxide, fe, 2, o, 3, in, a, richer, oxygen, environment, is, often, found, in, the, form, of, the, mineral, hematite, and, gives, the, rock, a, reddish, to, brownish, colour, in, arid, continental, climates, rocks, are, in, direct, contact, with, the, atmosphere, and, oxidation, is, an, important, process, giving, the, rock, a, red, or, orange, colour, thick, sequences, of, red, sedimentary, rocks, formed, in, arid, climates, are, called, red, beds, however, a, red, colour, does, not, necessarily, mean, the, rock, formed, in, a, continental, environment, or, arid, climate, the, presence, of, organic, material, can, colour, a, rock, black, or, grey, organic, material, is, formed, from, dead, organisms, mostly, plants, normally, such, material, eventually, decays, by, oxidation, or, bacterial, activity, under, anoxic, circumstances, however, organic, material, cannot, decay, and, leaves, a, dark, sediment, rich, in, organic, material, this, can, for, example, occur, at, the, bottom, of, deep, seas, and, lakes, there, is, little, water, mixing, in, such, environments, as, a, result, oxygen, from, surface, water, is, not, brought, down, and, the, deposited, sediment, is, normally, a, fine, dark, clay, dark, rocks, rich, in, organic, material, are, therefore, often, shales, the, size, form, and, orientation, of, clasts, the, original, pieces, of, rock, in, a, sediment, is, called, its, texture, the, texture, is, a, small, scale, property, of, a, rock, but, determines, many, of, its, large, scale, properties, such, as, the, density, porosity, or, permeability, the, 3d, orientation, of, the, clasts, is, called, the, fabric, of, the, rock, the, size, and, form, of, clasts, can, be, used, to, determine, the, velocity, and, direction, of, current, in, the, sedimentary, environment, that, moved, the, clasts, from, their, origin, fine, calcareous, mud, only, settles, in, quiet, water, while, gravel, and, larger, clasts, are, moved, only, by, rapidly, moving, water, the, grain, size, of, a, rock, is, usually, expressed, with, the, wentworth, scale, though, alternative, scales, are, sometimes, used, the, grain, size, can, be, expressed, as, a, diameter, or, a, volume, and, is, always, an, average, value, since, a, rock, is, composed, of, clasts, with, different, sizes, the, statistical, distribution, of, grain, sizes, is, different, for, different, rock, types, and, is, described, in, a, property, called, the, sorting, of, the, rock, when, all, clasts, are, more, or, less, of, the, same, size, the, rock, is, called, well, sorted, and, when, there, is, a, large, spread, in, grain, size, the, rock, is, called, poorly, sorted, the, form, of, the, clasts, can, reflect, the, origin, of, the, rock, for, example, coquina, a, rock, composed, of, clasts, of, broken, shells, can, only, form, in, energetic, water, the, form, of, a, clast, can, be, described, by, using, four, parameters, chemical, sedimentary, rocks, have, a, non, clastic, texture, consisting, entirely, of, crystals, to, describe, such, a, texture, only, the, average, size, of, the, crystals, and, the, fabric, are, necessary, most, sedimentary, rocks, contain, either, quartz, siliciclastic, rocks, or, calcite, carbonate, rocks, in, contrast, to, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, a, sedimentary, rock, usually, contains, very, few, different, major, minerals, however, the, origin, of, the, minerals, in, a, sedimentary, rock, is, often, more, complex, than, in, an, igneous, rock, minerals, in, a, sedimentary, rock, may, have, been, present, in, the, original, sediments, or, may, formed, by, precipitation, during, diagenesis, in, the, second, case, a, mineral, precipitate, may, have, grown, over, an, older, generation, of, cement, a, complex, diagenetic, history, can, be, established, by, optical, mineralogy, using, a, petrographic, microscope, carbonate, rocks, predominantly, consist, of, carbonate, minerals, such, as, calcite, aragonite, or, dolomite, both, the, cement, and, the, clasts, including, fossils, and, ooids, of, a, carbonate, sedimentary, rock, usually, consist, of, carbonate, minerals, the, mineralogy, of, a, clastic, rock, is, determined, by, the, material, supplied, by, the, source, area, the, manner, of, its, transport, to, the, place, of, deposition, and, the, stability, of, that, particular, mineral, the, resistance, of, rock, forming, minerals, to, weathering, is, expressed, by, the, goldich, dissolution, series, in, this, series, quartz, is, the, most, stable, followed, by, feldspar, micas, and, finally, other, less, stable, minerals, that, are, only, present, when, little, weathering, has, occurred, the, amount, of, weathering, depends, mainly, on, the, distance, to, the, source, area, the, local, climate, and, the, time, it, took, for, the, sediment, to, be, transported, to, the, point, where, it, is, deposited, in, most, sedimentary, rocks, mica, feldspar, and, less, stable, minerals, have, been, weathered, to, clay, minerals, like, kaolinite, illite, or, smectite, among, the, three, major, types, of, rock, fossils, are, most, commonly, found, in, sedimentary, rock, unlike, most, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, sedimentary, rocks, form, at, temperatures, and, pressures, that, do, not, destroy, fossil, remnants, often, these, fossils, may, only, be, visible, under, magnification, dead, organisms, in, nature, are, usually, quickly, removed, by, scavengers, bacteria, rotting, and, erosion, but, under, exceptional, circumstances, these, natural, processes, are, unable, to, take, place, leading, to, fossilisation, the, chance, of, fossilisation, is, higher, when, the, sedimentation, rate, is, high, so, that, a, carcass, is, quickly, buried, in, anoxic, environments, where, little, bacterial, activity, occurs, or, when, the, organism, had, a, particularly, hard, skeleton, larger, well, preserved, fossils, are, relatively, rare, fossils, can, be, both, the, direct, remains, or, imprints, of, organisms, and, their, skeletons, most, commonly, preserved, are, the, harder, parts, of, organisms, such, as, bones, shells, and, the, woody, tissue, of, plants, soft, tissue, has, a, much, smaller, chance, of, being, fossilized, and, the, preservation, of, soft, tissue, of, animals, older, than, 40, million, years, is, very, rare, imprints, of, organisms, made, while, they, were, still, alive, are, called, trace, fossils, examples, of, which, are, burrows, footprints, etc, as, a, part, of, a, sedimentary, rock, fossils, undergo, the, same, diagenetic, processes, as, does, the, host, rock, for, example, a, shell, consisting, of, calcite, can, dissolve, while, a, cement, of, silica, then, fills, the, cavity, in, the, same, way, precipitating, minerals, can, fill, cavities, formerly, occupied, by, blood, vessels, vascular, tissue, or, other, soft, tissues, this, preserves, the, form, of, the, organism, but, changes, the, chemical, composition, a, process, called, permineralization, the, most, common, minerals, involved, in, permineralization, are, various, forms, of, amorphous, silica, chalcedony, flint, chert, carbonates, especially, calcite, and, pyrite, at, high, pressure, and, temperature, the, organic, material, of, a, dead, organism, undergoes, chemical, reactions, in, which, volatiles, such, as, water, and, carbon, dioxide, are, expulsed, the, fossil, in, the, end, consists, of, a, thin, layer, of, pure, carbon, or, its, mineralized, form, graphite, this, form, of, fossilisation, is, called, carbonisation, it, is, particularly, important, for, plant, fossils, the, same, process, is, responsible, for, the, formation, of, fossil, fuels, like, lignite, or, coal, structures, in, sedimentary, rocks, can, be, divided, into, primary, structures, formed, during, deposition, and, secondary, structures, formed, after, deposition, unlike, textures, structures, are, always, large, scale, features, that, can, easily, be, studied, in, the, field, sedimentary, structures, can, indicate, something, about, the, sedimentary, environment, or, can, serve, to, tell, which, side, originally, faced, up, where, tectonics, have, tilted, or, overturned, sedimentary, layers, sedimentary, rocks, are, laid, down, in, layers, called, beds, or, strata, a, bed, is, defined, as, a, layer, of, rock, that, has, a, uniform, lithology, and, texture, beds, form, by, the, deposition, of, layers, of, sediment, on, top, of, each, other, the, sequence, of, beds, that, characterizes, sedimentary, rocks, is, called, bedding, single, beds, can, be, a, couple, of, centimetres, to, several, meters, thick, finer, less, pronounced, layers, are, called, laminae, and, the, structure, a, lamina, forms, in, a, rock, is, called, lamination, laminae, are, usually, less, than, a, few, centimetres, thick, though, bedding, and, lamination, are, often, originally, horizontal, in, nature, this, is, not, always, the, case, in, some, environments, beds, are, deposited, at, a, usually, small, angle, sometimes, multiple, sets, of, layers, with, different, orientations, exist, in, the, same, rock, a, structure, called, cross, bedding, cross, bedding, is, characteristic, of, deposition, by, a, flowing, medium, wind, or, water, the, opposite, of, cross, bedding, is, parallel, lamination, where, all, sedimentary, layering, is, parallel, differences, in, laminations, are, generally, caused, by, cyclic, changes, in, the, sediment, supply, caused, for, example, by, seasonal, changes, in, rainfall, temperature, or, biochemical, activity, laminae, that, represent, seasonal, changes, similar, to, tree, rings, are, called, varves, any, sedimentary, rock, composed, of, millimeter, or, finer, scale, layers, can, be, named, with, the, general, term, laminite, when, sedimentary, rocks, have, no, lamination, at, all, their, structural, character, is, called, massive, bedding, graded, bedding, is, a, structure, where, beds, with, a, smaller, grain, size, occur, on, top, of, beds, with, larger, grains, this, structure, forms, when, fast, flowing, water, stops, flowing, larger, heavier, clasts, in, suspension, settle, first, then, smaller, clasts, although, graded, bedding, can, form, in, many, different, environments, it, is, a, characteristic, of, turbidity, currents, the, surface, of, a, particular, bed, called, the, bedform, can, also, be, indicative, of, a, particular, sedimentary, environment, examples, of, bed, forms, include, dunes, and, ripple, marks, sole, markings, such, as, tool, marks, and, flute, casts, are, grooves, eroded, on, a, surface, that, are, preserved, by, renewed, sedimentation, these, are, often, elongated, structures, and, can, be, used, to, establish, the, direction, of, the, flow, during, deposition, ripple, marks, also, form, in, flowing, water, there, can, be, symmetric, or, asymmetric, asymmetric, ripples, form, in, environments, where, the, current, is, in, one, direction, such, as, rivers, the, longer, flank, of, such, ripples, is, on, the, upstream, side, of, the, current, symmetric, wave, ripples, occur, in, environments, where, currents, reverse, directions, such, as, tidal, flats, mudcracks, are, a, bed, form, caused, by, the, dehydration, of, sediment, that, occasionally, comes, above, the, water, surface, such, structures, are, commonly, found, at, tidal, flats, or, point, bars, along, rivers, secondary, sedimentary, structures, are, those, which, formed, after, deposition, such, structures, form, by, chemical, physical, and, biological, processes, within, the, sediment, they, can, be, indicators, of, circumstances, after, deposition, some, can, be, used, as, way, up, criteria, organic, materials, in, a, sediment, can, leave, more, traces, than, just, fossils, preserved, tracks, and, burrows, are, examples, of, trace, fossils, also, called, ichnofossils, such, traces, are, relatively, rare, most, trace, fossils, are, burrows, of, molluscs, or, arthropods, this, burrowing, is, called, bioturbation, by, sedimentologists, it, can, be, a, valuable, indicator, of, the, biological, and, ecological, environment, that, existed, after, the, sediment, was, deposited, on, the, other, hand, the, burrowing, activity, of, organisms, can, destroy, other, primary, structures, in, the, sediment, making, a, reconstruction, more, difficult, secondary, structures, can, also, form, by, diagenesis, or, the, formation, of, a, soil, pedogenesis, when, a, sediment, is, exposed, above, the, water, level, an, example, of, a, diagenetic, structure, common, in, carbonate, rocks, is, a, stylolite, stylolites, are, irregular, planes, where, material, was, dissolved, into, the, pore, fluids, in, the, rock, this, can, result, in, the, precipitation, of, a, certain, chemical, species, producing, colouring, and, staining, of, the, rock, or, the, formation, of, concretions, concretions, are, roughly, concentric, bodies, with, a, different, composition, from, the, host, rock, their, formation, can, be, the, result, of, localized, precipitation, due, to, small, differences, in, composition, or, porosity, of, the, host, rock, such, as, around, fossils, inside, burrows, or, around, plant, roots, in, carbonate, rocks, such, as, limestone, or, chalk, chert, or, flint, concretions, are, common, while, terrestrial, sandstones, sometimes, contain, iron, concretions, calcite, concretions, in, clay, containing, angular, cavities, or, cracks, are, called, septarian, concretions, after, deposition, physical, processes, can, deform, the, sediment, producing, a, third, class, of, secondary, structures, density, contrasts, between, different, sedimentary, layers, such, as, between, sand, and, clay, can, result, in, flame, structures, or, load, casts, formed, by, inverted, diapirism, while, the, clastic, bed, is, still, fluid, diapirism, can, cause, a, denser, upper, layer, to, sink, into, a, lower, layer, sometimes, density, contrasts, occur, or, are, enhanced, when, one, of, the, lithologies, dehydrates, clay, can, be, easily, compressed, as, a, result, of, dehydration, while, sand, retains, the, same, volume, and, becomes, relatively, less, dense, on, the, other, hand, when, the, pore, fluid, pressure, in, a, sand, layer, surpasses, a, critical, point, the, sand, can, break, through, overlying, clay, layers, and, flow, through, forming, discordant, bodies, of, sedimentary, rock, called, sedimentary, dykes, the, same, process, can, form, mud, volcanoes, on, the, surface, where, they, broke, through, upper, layers, sedimentary, dykes, can, also, be, formed, in, a, cold, climate, where, the, soil, is, permanently, frozen, during, a, large, part, of, the, year, frost, weathering, can, form, cracks, in, the, soil, that, fill, with, rubble, from, above, such, structures, can, be, used, as, climate, indicators, as, well, as, way, up, structures, density, contrasts, can, also, cause, small, scale, faulting, even, while, sedimentation, progresses, synchronous, sedimentary, faulting, such, faulting, can, also, occur, when, large, masses, of, non, lithified, sediment, are, deposited, on, a, slope, such, as, at, the, front, side, of, a, delta, or, the, continental, slope, instabilities, in, such, sediments, can, result, in, the, deposited, material, to, slump, producing, fissures, and, folding, the, resulting, structures, in, the, rock, are, syn, sedimentary, folds, and, faults, which, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, from, folds, and, faults, formed, by, tectonic, forces, acting, on, lithified, rocks, the, setting, in, which, a, sedimentary, rock, forms, is, called, the, depositional, environment, every, environment, has, a, characteristic, combination, of, geologic, processes, and, circumstances, the, type, of, sediment, that, is, deposited, is, not, only, dependent, on, the, sediment, that, is, transported, to, a, place, provenance, but, also, on, the, environment, itself, a, marine, environment, means, that, the, rock, was, formed, in, a, sea, or, ocean, often, a, distinction, is, made, between, deep, and, shallow, marine, environments, deep, marine, usually, refers, to, environments, more, than, 200, m, below, the, water, surface, including, the, abyssal, plain, shallow, marine, environments, exist, adjacent, to, coastlines, and, can, extend, to, the, boundaries, of, the, continental, shelf, the, water, movements, in, such, environments, have, a, generally, higher, energy, than, that, in, deep, environments, as, wave, activity, diminishes, with, depth, this, means, that, coarser, sediment, particles, can, be, transported, and, the, deposited, sediment, can, be, coarser, than, in, deeper, environments, when, the, sediment, is, transported, from, the, continent, an, alternation, of, sand, clay, and, silt, is, deposited, when, the, continent, is, far, away, the, amount, of, such, sediment, deposited, may, be, small, and, biochemical, processes, dominate, the, type, of, rock, that, forms, especially, in, warm, climates, shallow, marine, environments, far, offshore, mainly, see, deposition, of, carbonate, rocks, the, shallow, warm, water, is, an, ideal, habitat, for, many, small, organisms, that, build, carbonate, skeletons, when, these, organisms, die, their, skeletons, sink, to, the, bottom, forming, a, thick, layer, of, calcareous, mud, that, may, lithify, into, limestone, warm, shallow, marine, environments, also, are, ideal, environments, for, coral, reefs, where, the, sediment, consists, mainly, of, the, calcareous, skeletons, of, larger, organisms, in, deep, marine, environments, the, water, current, working, the, sea, bottom, is, small, only, fine, particles, can, be, transported, to, such, places, typically, sediments, depositing, on, the, ocean, floor, are, fine, clay, or, small, skeletons, of, micro, organisms, at, 4, km, depth, the, solubility, of, carbonates, increases, dramatically, the, depth, zone, where, this, happens, is, called, the, lysocline, calcareous, sediment, that, sinks, below, the, lysocline, dissolves, as, a, result, no, limestone, can, be, formed, below, this, depth, skeletons, of, micro, organisms, formed, of, silica, such, as, radiolarians, are, not, as, soluble, and, are, still, deposited, an, example, of, a, rock, formed, of, silica, skeletons, is, radiolarite, when, the, bottom, of, the, sea, has, a, small, inclination, for, example, at, the, continental, slopes, the, sedimentary, cover, can, become, unstable, causing, turbidity, currents, turbidity, currents, are, sudden, disturbances, of, the, normally, quiet, deep, marine, environment, and, can, cause, the, near, instantaneous, deposition, of, large, amounts, of, sediment, such, as, sand, and, silt, the, rock, sequence, formed, by, a, turbidity, current, is, called, a, turbidite, the, coast, is, an, environment, dominated, by, wave, action, at, a, beach, dominantly, denser, sediment, such, as, sand, or, gravel, often, mingled, with, shell, fragments, is, deposited, while, the, silt, and, clay, sized, material, is, kept, in, mechanical, suspension, tidal, flats, and, shoals, are, places, that, sometimes, dry, because, of, the, tide, they, are, often, cross, cut, by, gullies, where, the, current, is, strong, and, the, grain, size, of, the, deposited, sediment, is, larger, where, rivers, enter, the, body, of, water, either, on, a, sea, or, lake, coast, deltas, can, form, these, are, large, accumulations, of, sediment, transported, from, the, continent, to, places, in, front, of, the, mouth, of, the, river, deltas, are, dominantly, composed, of, clastic, rather, than, chemical, sediment, a, continental, sedimentary, environment, is, an, environment, in, the, interior, of, a, continent, examples, of, continental, environments, are, lagoons, lakes, swamps, floodplains, and, alluvial, fans, in, the, quiet, water, of, swamps, lakes, and, lagoons, fine, sediment, is, deposited, mingled, with, organic, material, from, dead, plants, and, animals, in, rivers, the, energy, of, the, water, is, much, greater, and, can, transport, heavier, clastic, material, besides, transport, by, water, sediment, can, be, transported, by, wind, or, glaciers, sediment, transported, by, wind, is, called, aeolian, and, is, almost, always, very, well, sorted, while, sediment, transported, by, a, glacier, is, called, glacial, till, and, is, characterized, by, very, poor, sorting, aeolian, deposits, can, be, quite, striking, the, depositional, environment, of, the, touchet, formation, located, in, the, northwestern, united, states, had, intervening, periods, of, aridity, which, resulted, in, a, series, of, rhythmite, layers, erosional, cracks, were, later, infilled, with, layers, of, soil, material, especially, from, aeolian, processes, the, infilled, sections, formed, vertical, inclusions, in, the, horizontally, deposited, layers, and, thus, provided, evidence, of, the, sequence, of, events, during, deposition, of, the, forty, one, layers, of, the, formation, the, kind, of, rock, formed, in, a, particular, depositional, environment, is, called, its, sedimentary, facies, sedimentary, environments, usually, exist, alongside, each, other, in, certain, natural, successions, a, beach, where, sand, and, gravel, is, deposited, is, usually, bounded, by, a, deeper, marine, environment, a, little, offshore, where, finer, sediments, are, deposited, at, the, same, time, behind, the, beach, there, can, be, dunes, where, the, dominant, deposition, is, well, sorted, sand, or, a, lagoon, where, fine, clay, and, organic, material, is, deposited, every, sedimentary, environment, has, its, own, characteristic, deposits, when, sedimentary, strata, accumulate, through, time, the, environment, can, shift, forming, a, change, in, facies, in, the, subsurface, at, one, location, on, the, other, hand, when, a, rock, layer, with, a, certain, age, is, followed, laterally, the, lithology, the, type, of, rock, and, facies, eventually, change, facies, can, be, distinguished, in, a, number, of, ways, the, most, common, are, by, the, lithology, for, example, limestone, siltstone, or, sandstone, or, by, fossil, content, coral, for, example, only, lives, in, warm, and, shallow, marine, environments, and, fossils, of, coral, are, thus, typical, for, shallow, marine, facies, facies, determined, by, lithology, are, called, lithofacies, facies, determined, by, fossils, are, biofacies, sedimentary, environments, can, shift, their, geographical, positions, through, time, coastlines, can, shift, in, the, direction, of, the, sea, when, the, sea, level, drops, regression, when, the, surface, rises, transgression, due, to, tectonic, forces, in, the, earth, s, crust, or, when, a, river, forms, a, large, delta, in, the, subsurface, such, geographic, shifts, of, sedimentary, environments, of, the, past, are, recorded, in, shifts, in, sedimentary, facies, this, means, that, sedimentary, facies, can, change, either, parallel, or, perpendicular, to, an, imaginary, layer, of, rock, with, a, fixed, age, a, phenomenon, described, by, walther, s, law, the, situation, in, which, coastlines, move, in, the, direction, of, the, continent, is, called, transgression, in, the, case, of, transgression, deeper, marine, facies, are, deposited, over, shallower, facies, a, succession, called, onlap, regression, is, the, situation, in, which, a, coastline, moves, in, the, direction, of, the, sea, with, regression, shallower, facies, are, deposited, on, top, of, deeper, facies, a, situation, called, offlap, the, facies, of, all, rocks, of, a, certain, age, can, be, plotted, on, a, map, to, give, an, overview, of, the, palaeogeography, a, sequence, of, maps, for, different, ages, can, give, an, insight, in, the, development, of, the, regional, geography, places, where, large, scale, sedimentation, takes, place, are, called, sedimentary, basins, the, amount, of, sediment, that, can, be, deposited, in, a, basin, depends, on, the, depth, of, the, basin, the, so, called, accommodation, space, the, depth, shape, and, size, of, a, basin, depend, on, tectonics, movements, within, the, earth, s, lithosphere, where, the, lithosphere, moves, upward, tectonic, uplift, land, eventually, rises, above, sea, level, and, the, area, becomes, a, source, for, new, sediment, as, erosion, removes, material, where, the, lithosphere, moves, downward, tectonic, subsidence, a, basin, forms, and, sediments, are, deposited, a, type, of, basin, formed, by, the, moving, apart, of, two, pieces, of, a, continent, is, called, a, rift, basin, rift, basins, are, elongated, narrow, and, deep, basins, due, to, divergent, movement, the, lithosphere, is, stretched, and, thinned, so, that, the, hot, asthenosphere, rises, and, heats, the, overlying, rift, basin, apart, from, continental, sediments, rift, basins, normally, also, have, part, of, their, infill, consisting, of, volcanic, deposits, when, the, basin, grows, due, to, continued, stretching, of, the, lithosphere, the, rift, grows, and, the, sea, can, enter, forming, marine, deposits, when, a, piece, of, lithosphere, that, was, heated, and, stretched, cools, again, its, density, rises, causing, isostatic, subsidence, if, this, subsidence, continues, long, enough, the, basin, is, called, a, sag, basin, examples, of, sag, basins, are, the, regions, along, passive, continental, margins, but, sag, basins, can, also, be, found, in, the, interior, of, continents, in, sag, basins, the, extra, weight, of, the, newly, deposited, sediments, is, enough, to, keep, the, subsidence, going, in, a, vicious, circle, the, total, thickness, of, the, sedimentary, infill, in, a, sag, basin, can, thus, exceed, 10, km, a, third, type, of, basin, exists, along, convergent, plate, boundaries, places, where, one, tectonic, plate, moves, under, another, into, the, asthenosphere, the, subducting, plate, bends, and, forms, a, fore, arc, basin, in, front, of, the, overriding, plate, an, elongated, deep, asymmetric, basin, fore, arc, basins, are, filled, with, deep, marine, deposits, and, thick, sequences, of, turbidites, such, infill, is, called, flysch, when, the, convergent, movement, of, the, two, plates, results, in, continental, collision, the, basin, becomes, shallower, and, develops, into, a, foreland, basin, at, the, same, time, tectonic, uplift, forms, a, mountain, belt, in, the, overriding, plate, from, which, large, amounts, of, material, are, eroded, and, transported, to, the, basin, such, erosional, material, of, a, growing, mountain, chain, is, called, molasse, and, has, either, a, shallow, marine, or, a, continental, facies, at, the, same, time, the, growing, weight, of, the, mountain, belt, can, cause, isostatic, subsidence, in, the, area, of, the, overriding, plate, on, the, other, side, to, the, mountain, belt, the, basin, type, resulting, from, this, subsidence, is, called, a, back, arc, basin, and, is, usually, filled, by, shallow, marine, deposits, and, molasse, in, many, cases, facies, changes, and, other, lithological, features, in, sequences, of, sedimentary, rock, have, a, cyclic, nature, this, cyclic, nature, was, caused, by, cyclic, changes, in, sediment, supply, and, the, sedimentary, environment, most, of, these, cyclic, changes, are, caused, by, astronomic, cycles, short, astronomic, cycles, can, be, the, difference, between, the, tides, or, the, spring, tide, every, two, weeks, on, a, larger, time, scale, cyclic, changes, in, climate, and, sea, level, are, caused, by, milankovitch, cycles, cyclic, changes, in, the, orientation, and, or, position, of, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, and, orbit, around, the, sun, there, are, a, number, of, milankovitch, cycles, known, lasting, between, 10, 000, and, 200, 000, years, relatively, small, changes, in, the, orientation, of, the, earth, s, axis, or, length, of, the, seasons, can, be, a, major, influence, on, the, earth, s, climate, an, example, are, the, ice, ages, of, the, past, 2, 6, million, years, the, quaternary, period, which, are, assumed, to, have, been, caused, by, astronomic, cycles, climate, change, can, influence, the, global, sea, level, and, thus, the, amount, of, accommodation, space, in, sedimentary, basins, and, sediment, supply, from, a, certain, region, eventually, small, changes, in, astronomic, parameters, can, cause, large, changes, in, sedimentary, environment, and, sedimentation, the, rate, at, which, sediment, is, deposited, differs, depending, on, the, location, a, channel, in, a, tidal, flat, can, see, the, deposition, of, a, few, metres, of, sediment, in, one, day, while, on, the, deep, ocean, floor, each, year, only, a, few, millimetres, of, sediment, accumulate, a, distinction, can, be, made, between, normal, sedimentation, and, sedimentation, caused, by, catastrophic, processes, the, latter, category, includes, all, kinds, of, sudden, exceptional, processes, like, mass, movements, rock, slides, or, flooding, catastrophic, processes, can, see, the, sudden, deposition, of, a, large, amount, of, sediment, at, once, in, some, sedimentary, environments, most, of, the, total, column, of, sedimentary, rock, was, formed, by, catastrophic, processes, even, though, the, environment, is, usually, a, quiet, place, other, sedimentary, environments, are, dominated, by, normal, ongoing, sedimentation, in, many, cases, sedimentation, occurs, slowly, in, a, desert, for, example, the, wind, deposits, siliciclastic, material, sand, or, silt, in, some, spots, or, catastrophic, flooding, of, a, wadi, may, cause, sudden, deposits, of, large, quantities, of, detrital, material, but, in, most, places, eolian, erosion, dominates, the, amount, of, sedimentary, rock, that, forms, is, not, only, dependent, on, the, amount, of, supplied, material, but, also, on, how, well, the, material, consolidates, erosion, removes, most, deposited, sediment, shortly, after, deposition, that, new, rock, layers, are, above, older, rock, layers, is, stated, in, the, principle, of, superposition, there, are, usually, some, gaps, in, the, sequence, called, unconformities, these, represent, periods, where, no, new, sediments, were, laid, down, or, when, earlier, sedimentary, layers, were, raised, above, sea, level, and, eroded, away, sedimentary, rocks, contain, important, information, about, the, history, of, the, earth, they, contain, fossils, the, preserved, remains, of, ancient, plants, and, animals, coal, is, considered, a, type, of, sedimentary, rock, the, composition, of, sediments, provides, us, with, clues, as, to, the, original, rock, differences, between, successive, layers, indicate, changes, to, the, environment, over, time, sedimentary, rocks, can, contain, fossils, because, unlike, most, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, they, form, at, temperatures, and, pressures, that, do, not, destroy, fossil, remains, provenance, is, the, reconstruction, of, the, origin, of, sediments, all, rock, exposed, at, earth, s, surface, is, subjected, to, physical, or, chemical, weathering, and, broken, down, into, finer, grained, sediment, all, three, types, of, rocks, igneous, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rocks, can, be, the, source, of, sedimentary, detritus, the, purpose, of, sedimentary, provenance, studies, is, to, reconstruct, and, interpret, the, history, of, sediment, from, the, initial, parent, rocks, at, a, source, area, to, final, detritus, at, a, burial, place, ref
