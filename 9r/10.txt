a, scientific, theory, is, an, explanation, of, an, aspect, of, the, natural, world, and, universe, that, can, be, or, a, fortiori, that, has, been, repeatedly, tested, and, corroborated, in, accordance, with, the, scientific, method, using, accepted, protocols, of, observation, measurement, and, evaluation, of, results, where, possible, theories, are, tested, under, controlled, conditions, in, an, experiment, in, circumstances, not, amenable, to, experimental, testing, theories, are, evaluated, through, principles, of, abductive, reasoning, established, scientific, theories, have, withstood, rigorous, scrutiny, and, embody, scientific, knowledge, a, scientific, theory, differs, from, a, scientific, fact, or, scientific, law, in, that, a, theory, seeks, to, explain, why, or, how, whereas, a, fact, is, a, simple, basic, observation, and, a, law, is, an, empirical, description, of, a, relationship, between, facts, and, or, other, laws, for, example, newton, s, law, of, gravity, is, a, mathematical, equation, that, can, be, used, to, predict, the, attraction, between, bodies, but, it, is, not, a, theory, to, explain, how, gravity, works, stephen, jay, gould, wrote, that, facts, and, theories, are, different, things, not, rungs, in, a, hierarchy, of, increasing, certainty, facts, are, the, world, s, data, theories, are, structures, of, ideas, that, explain, and, interpret, facts, the, meaning, of, the, term, scientific, theory, often, contracted, to, theory, for, brevity, as, used, in, the, disciplines, of, science, is, significantly, different, from, the, common, vernacular, usage, of, theory, in, everyday, speech, theory, can, imply, an, explanation, that, represents, an, unsubstantiated, and, speculative, guess, whereas, in, a, scientific, context, it, most, often, refers, to, an, explanation, that, has, already, been, tested, and, is, widely, accepted, as, valid, the, strength, of, a, scientific, theory, is, related, to, the, diversity, of, phenomena, it, can, explain, and, its, simplicity, as, additional, scientific, evidence, is, gathered, a, scientific, theory, may, be, modified, and, ultimately, rejected, if, it, cannot, be, made, to, fit, the, new, findings, in, such, circumstances, a, more, accurate, theory, is, then, required, some, theories, are, so, well, established, that, they, are, unlikely, ever, to, be, fundamentally, changed, for, example, scientific, theories, such, as, evolution, heliocentric, theory, cell, theory, theory, of, plate, tectonics, germ, theory, of, disease, etc, in, certain, cases, a, scientific, theory, or, scientific, law, that, fails, to, fit, all, data, can, still, be, useful, due, to, its, simplicity, as, an, approximation, under, specific, conditions, an, example, is, newton, s, laws, of, motion, which, are, a, highly, accurate, approximation, to, special, relativity, at, velocities, that, are, small, relative, to, the, speed, of, light, scientific, theories, are, testable, and, make, verifiable, predictions, they, describe, the, causes, of, a, particular, natural, phenomenon, and, are, used, to, explain, and, predict, aspects, of, the, physical, universe, or, specific, areas, of, inquiry, for, example, electricity, chemistry, and, astronomy, as, with, other, forms, of, scientific, knowledge, scientific, theories, are, both, deductive, and, inductive, aiming, for, predictive, and, explanatory, power, scientists, use, theories, to, further, scientific, knowledge, as, well, as, to, facilitate, advances, in, technology, or, medicine, scientific, hypothesis, can, never, be, proven, because, scientists, are, not, able, to, fully, confirm, that, their, hypothesis, is, true, instead, scientists, say, that, the, study, supports, or, is, consistent, with, their, hypothesis, albert, einstein, described, two, different, types, of, scientific, theories, constructive, theories, and, principle, theories, constructive, theories, are, constructive, models, for, phenomena, for, example, kinetic, theory, principle, theories, are, empirical, generalisations, one, such, example, being, newton, s, laws, of, motion, for, any, theory, to, be, accepted, within, most, academia, there, is, usually, one, simple, criterion, the, essential, criterion, is, that, the, theory, must, be, observable, and, repeatable, the, aforementioned, criterion, is, essential, to, prevent, fraud, and, perpetuate, science, itself, the, defining, characteristic, of, all, scientific, knowledge, including, theories, is, the, ability, to, make, falsifiable, or, testable, predictions, the, relevance, and, specificity, of, those, predictions, determine, how, potentially, useful, the, theory, is, a, would, be, theory, that, makes, no, observable, predictions, is, not, a, scientific, theory, at, all, predictions, not, sufficiently, specific, to, be, tested, are, similarly, not, useful, in, both, cases, the, term, theory, is, not, applicable, a, body, of, descriptions, of, knowledge, can, be, called, a, theory, if, it, fulfills, the, following, criteria, these, qualities, are, certainly, true, of, such, established, theories, as, special, and, general, relativity, quantum, mechanics, plate, tectonics, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, etc, in, addition, most, scientists, prefer, to, work, with, a, theory, that, meets, the, following, qualities, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, defines, scientific, theories, as, follows, the, formal, scientific, definition, of, theory, is, quite, different, from, the, everyday, meaning, of, the, word, it, refers, to, a, comprehensive, explanation, of, some, aspect, of, nature, that, is, supported, by, a, vast, body, of, evidence, many, scientific, theories, are, so, well, established, that, no, new, evidence, is, likely, to, alter, them, substantially, for, example, no, new, evidence, will, demonstrate, that, the, earth, does, not, orbit, around, the, sun, heliocentric, theory, or, that, living, things, are, not, made, of, cells, cell, theory, that, matter, is, not, composed, of, atoms, or, that, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, not, divided, into, solid, plates, that, have, moved, over, geological, timescales, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, one, of, the, most, useful, properties, of, scientific, theories, is, that, they, can, be, used, to, make, predictions, about, natural, events, or, phenomena, that, have, not, yet, been, observed, from, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, a, scientific, theory, is, a, well, substantiated, explanation, of, some, aspect, of, the, natural, world, based, on, a, body, of, facts, that, have, been, repeatedly, confirmed, through, observation, and, experiment, such, fact, supported, theories, are, not, guesses, but, reliable, accounts, of, the, real, world, the, theory, of, biological, evolution, is, more, than, just, a, theory, it, is, as, factual, an, explanation, of, the, universe, as, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, or, the, germ, theory, of, disease, our, understanding, of, gravity, is, still, a, work, in, progress, but, the, phenomenon, of, gravity, like, evolution, is, an, accepted, fact, note, that, the, term, theory, would, not, be, appropriate, for, describing, untested, but, intricate, hypotheses, or, even, scientific, models, the, scientific, method, involves, the, proposal, and, testing, of, hypotheses, by, deriving, predictions, from, the, hypotheses, about, the, results, of, future, experiments, then, performing, those, experiments, to, see, whether, the, predictions, are, valid, this, provides, evidence, either, for, or, against, the, hypothesis, when, enough, experimental, results, have, been, gathered, in, a, particular, area, of, inquiry, scientists, may, propose, an, explanatory, framework, that, accounts, for, as, many, of, these, as, possible, this, explanation, is, also, tested, and, if, it, fulfills, the, necessary, criteria, see, above, then, the, explanation, becomes, a, theory, this, can, take, many, years, as, it, can, be, difficult, or, complicated, to, gather, sufficient, evidence, once, all, of, the, criteria, have, been, met, it, will, be, widely, accepted, by, scientists, see, scientific, consensus, as, the, best, available, explanation, of, at, least, some, phenomena, it, will, have, made, predictions, of, phenomena, that, previous, theories, could, not, explain, or, could, not, predict, accurately, and, it, will, have, many, repeated, bouts, of, testing, the, strength, of, the, evidence, is, evaluated, by, the, scientific, community, and, the, most, important, experiments, will, have, been, replicated, by, multiple, independent, groups, theories, do, not, have, to, be, perfectly, accurate, to, be, scientifically, useful, for, example, the, predictions, made, by, classical, mechanics, are, known, to, be, inaccurate, in, the, relativistic, realm, but, they, are, almost, exactly, correct, at, the, comparatively, low, velocities, of, common, human, experience, in, chemistry, there, are, many, acid, base, theories, providing, highly, divergent, explanations, of, the, underlying, nature, of, acidic, and, basic, compounds, but, they, are, very, useful, for, predicting, their, chemical, behavior, like, all, knowledge, in, science, no, theory, can, ever, be, completely, certain, since, it, is, possible, that, future, experiments, might, conflict, with, the, theory, s, predictions, however, theories, supported, by, the, scientific, consensus, have, the, highest, level, of, certainty, of, any, scientific, knowledge, for, example, that, all, objects, are, subject, to, gravity, or, that, life, on, earth, evolved, from, a, common, ancestor, acceptance, of, a, theory, does, not, require, that, all, of, its, major, predictions, be, tested, if, it, is, already, supported, by, sufficiently, strong, evidence, for, example, certain, tests, may, be, unfeasible, or, technically, difficult, as, a, result, theories, may, make, predictions, that, have, not, yet, been, confirmed, or, proven, incorrect, in, this, case, the, predicted, results, may, be, described, informally, with, the, term, theoretical, these, predictions, can, be, tested, at, a, later, time, and, if, they, are, incorrect, this, may, lead, to, the, revision, or, rejection, of, the, theory, as, feynman, puts, it, it, doesn, t, matter, how, beautiful, your, theory, is, it, doesn, t, matter, how, smart, you, are, if, it, doesn, t, agree, with, experiment, it, s, wrong, if, experimental, results, contrary, to, a, theory, s, predictions, are, observed, scientists, first, evaluate, whether, the, experimental, design, was, sound, and, if, so, they, confirm, the, results, by, independent, replication, a, search, for, potential, improvements, to, the, theory, then, begins, solutions, may, require, minor, or, major, changes, to, the, theory, or, none, at, all, if, a, satisfactory, explanation, is, found, within, the, theory, s, existing, framework, over, time, as, successive, modifications, build, on, top, of, each, other, theories, consistently, improve, and, greater, predictive, accuracy, is, achieved, since, each, new, version, of, a, theory, or, a, completely, new, theory, must, have, more, predictive, and, explanatory, power, than, the, last, scientific, knowledge, consistently, becomes, more, accurate, over, time, if, modifications, to, the, theory, or, other, explanations, seem, to, be, insufficient, to, account, for, the, new, results, then, a, new, theory, may, be, required, since, scientific, knowledge, is, usually, durable, this, occurs, much, less, commonly, than, modification, furthermore, until, such, a, theory, is, proposed, and, accepted, the, previous, theory, will, be, retained, this, is, because, it, is, still, the, best, available, explanation, for, many, other, phenomena, as, verified, by, its, predictive, power, in, other, contexts, for, example, it, has, been, known, since, 1859, that, the, observed, perihelion, precession, of, mercury, violates, newtonian, mechanics, but, the, theory, remained, the, best, explanation, available, until, relativity, was, supported, by, sufficient, evidence, also, while, new, theories, may, be, proposed, by, a, single, person, or, by, many, the, cycle, of, modifications, eventually, incorporates, contributions, from, many, different, scientists, after, the, changes, the, accepted, theory, will, explain, more, phenomena, and, have, greater, predictive, power, if, it, did, not, the, changes, would, not, be, adopted, this, new, explanation, will, then, be, open, to, further, replacement, or, modification, if, a, theory, does, not, require, modification, despite, repeated, tests, this, implies, that, the, theory, is, very, accurate, this, also, means, that, accepted, theories, continue, to, accumulate, evidence, over, time, and, the, length, of, time, that, a, theory, or, any, of, its, principles, remains, accepted, often, indicates, the, strength, of, its, supporting, evidence, in, some, cases, two, or, more, theories, may, be, replaced, by, a, single, theory, that, explains, the, previous, theories, as, approximations, or, special, cases, analogous, to, the, way, a, theory, is, a, unifying, explanation, for, many, confirmed, hypotheses, this, is, referred, to, as, unification, of, theories, for, example, electricity, and, magnetism, are, now, known, to, be, two, aspects, of, the, same, phenomenon, referred, to, as, electromagnetism, when, the, predictions, of, different, theories, appear, to, contradict, each, other, this, is, also, resolved, by, either, further, evidence, or, unification, for, example, physical, theories, in, the, 19th, century, implied, that, the, sun, could, not, have, been, burning, long, enough, to, allow, certain, geological, changes, as, well, as, the, evolution, of, life, this, was, resolved, by, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fusion, the, main, energy, source, of, the, sun, contradictions, can, also, be, explained, as, the, result, of, theories, approximating, more, fundamental, non, contradictory, phenomena, for, example, atomic, theory, is, an, approximation, of, quantum, mechanics, current, theories, describe, three, separate, fundamental, phenomena, of, which, all, other, theories, are, approximations, the, potential, unification, of, these, is, sometimes, called, the, theory, of, everything, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, the, principle, of, special, relativity, which, soon, became, a, theory, special, relativity, predicted, the, alignment, of, the, newtonian, principle, of, galilean, invariance, also, termed, galilean, relativity, with, the, electromagnetic, field, by, omitting, from, special, relativity, the, luminiferous, aether, einstein, stated, that, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, measured, in, an, object, in, relative, motion, is, inertial, that, is, the, object, exhibits, constant, velocity, which, is, speed, with, direction, when, measured, by, its, observer, he, thereby, duplicated, the, lorentz, transformation, and, the, lorentz, contraction, that, had, been, hypothesized, to, resolve, experimental, riddles, and, inserted, into, electrodynamic, theory, as, dynamical, consequences, of, the, aether, s, properties, an, elegant, theory, special, relativity, yielded, its, own, consequences, such, as, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, transforming, into, one, another, and, the, resolution, of, the, paradox, that, an, excitation, of, the, electromagnetic, field, could, be, viewed, in, one, reference, frame, as, electricity, but, in, another, as, magnetism, einstein, sought, to, generalize, the, invariance, principle, to, all, reference, frames, whether, inertial, or, accelerating, rejecting, newtonian, gravitation, a, central, force, acting, instantly, at, a, distance, einstein, presumed, a, gravitational, field, in, 1907, einstein, s, equivalence, principle, implied, that, a, free, fall, within, a, uniform, gravitational, field, is, equivalent, to, inertial, motion, by, extending, special, relativity, s, effects, into, three, dimensions, general, relativity, extended, length, contraction, into, space, contraction, conceiving, of, 4d, space, time, as, the, gravitational, field, that, alters, geometrically, and, sets, all, local, objects, pathways, even, massless, energy, exerts, gravitational, motion, on, local, objects, by, curving, the, geometrical, surface, of, 4d, space, time, yet, unless, the, energy, is, vast, its, relativistic, effects, of, contracting, space, and, slowing, time, are, negligible, when, merely, predicting, motion, although, general, relativity, is, embraced, as, the, more, explanatory, theory, via, scientific, realism, newton, s, theory, remains, successful, as, merely, a, predictive, theory, via, instrumentalism, to, calculate, trajectories, engineers, and, nasa, still, uses, newton, s, equations, which, are, simpler, to, operate, both, scientific, laws, and, scientific, theories, are, produced, from, the, scientific, method, through, the, formation, and, testing, of, hypotheses, and, can, predict, the, behavior, of, the, natural, world, both, are, also, typically, well, supported, by, observations, and, or, experimental, evidence, however, scientific, laws, are, descriptive, accounts, of, how, nature, will, behave, under, certain, conditions, scientific, theories, are, broader, in, scope, and, give, overarching, explanations, of, how, nature, works, and, why, it, exhibits, certain, characteristics, theories, are, supported, by, evidence, from, many, different, sources, and, may, contain, one, or, several, laws, a, common, misconception, is, that, scientific, theories, are, rudimentary, ideas, that, will, eventually, graduate, into, scientific, laws, when, enough, data, and, evidence, have, been, accumulated, a, theory, does, not, change, into, a, scientific, law, with, the, accumulation, of, new, or, better, evidence, a, theory, will, always, remain, a, theory, a, law, will, always, remain, a, law, both, theories, and, laws, could, potentially, be, falsified, by, countervailing, evidence, theories, and, laws, are, also, distinct, from, hypotheses, unlike, hypotheses, theories, and, laws, may, be, simply, referred, to, as, scientific, fact, however, in, science, theories, are, different, from, facts, even, when, they, are, well, supported, for, example, evolution, is, both, a, theory, and, a, fact, the, logical, positivists, thought, of, scientific, theories, as, statements, in, a, formal, language, first, order, logic, is, an, example, of, a, formal, language, the, logical, positivists, envisaged, a, similar, scientific, language, in, addition, to, scientific, theories, the, language, also, included, observation, sentences, the, sun, rises, in, the, east, definitions, and, mathematical, statements, the, phenomena, explained, by, the, theories, if, they, could, not, be, directly, observed, by, the, senses, for, example, atoms, and, radio, waves, were, treated, as, theoretical, concepts, in, this, view, theories, function, as, axioms, predicted, observations, are, derived, from, the, theories, much, like, theorems, are, derived, in, euclidean, geometry, however, the, predictions, are, then, tested, against, reality, to, verify, the, predictions, and, the, axioms, can, be, revised, as, a, direct, result, the, phrase, the, received, view, of, theories, is, used, to, describe, this, approach, terms, commonly, associated, with, it, are, linguistic, because, theories, are, components, of, a, language, and, syntactic, because, a, language, has, rules, about, how, symbols, can, be, strung, together, problems, in, defining, this, kind, of, language, precisely, e, g, are, objects, seen, in, microscopes, observed, or, are, they, theoretical, objects, led, to, the, effective, demise, of, logical, positivism, in, the, 1970s, the, semantic, view, of, theories, which, identifies, scientific, theories, with, models, rather, than, propositions, has, replaced, the, received, view, as, the, dominant, position, in, theory, formulation, in, the, philosophy, of, science, a, model, is, a, logical, framework, intended, to, represent, reality, a, model, of, reality, similar, to, the, way, that, a, map, is, a, graphical, model, that, represents, the, territory, of, a, city, or, country, in, this, approach, theories, are, a, specific, category, of, models, that, fulfill, the, necessary, criteria, see, above, one, can, use, language, to, describe, a, model, however, the, theory, is, the, model, or, a, collection, of, similar, models, and, not, the, description, of, the, model, a, model, of, the, solar, system, for, example, might, consist, of, abstract, objects, that, represent, the, sun, and, the, planets, these, objects, have, associated, properties, e, g, positions, velocities, and, masses, the, model, parameters, e, g, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, determine, how, the, positions, and, velocities, change, with, time, this, model, can, then, be, tested, to, see, whether, it, accurately, predicts, future, observations, astronomers, can, verify, that, the, positions, of, the, model, s, objects, over, time, match, the, actual, positions, of, the, planets, for, most, planets, the, newtonian, model, s, predictions, are, accurate, for, mercury, it, is, slightly, inaccurate, and, the, model, of, general, relativity, must, be, used, instead, the, word, semantic, refers, to, the, way, that, a, model, represents, the, real, world, the, representation, literally, re, presentation, describes, particular, aspects, of, a, phenomenon, or, the, manner, of, interaction, among, a, set, of, phenomena, for, instance, a, scale, model, of, a, house, or, of, a, solar, system, is, clearly, not, an, actual, house, or, an, actual, solar, system, the, aspects, of, an, actual, house, or, an, actual, solar, system, represented, in, a, scale, model, are, only, in, certain, limited, ways, representative, of, the, actual, entity, a, scale, model, of, a, house, is, not, a, house, but, to, someone, who, wants, to, learn, about, houses, analogous, to, a, scientist, who, wants, to, understand, reality, a, sufficiently, detailed, scale, model, may, suffice, several, commentators, have, stated, that, the, distinguishing, characteristic, of, theories, is, that, they, are, explanatory, as, well, as, descriptive, while, models, are, only, descriptive, although, still, predictive, in, a, more, limited, sense, philosopher, stephen, pepper, also, distinguished, between, theories, and, models, and, said, in, 1948, that, general, models, and, theories, are, predicated, on, a, root, metaphor, that, constrains, how, scientists, theorize, and, model, a, phenomenon, and, thus, arrive, at, testable, hypotheses, engineering, practice, makes, a, distinction, between, mathematical, models, and, physical, models, the, cost, of, fabricating, a, physical, model, can, be, minimized, by, first, creating, a, mathematical, model, using, a, computer, software, package, such, as, a, computer, aided, design, tool, the, component, parts, are, each, themselves, modelled, and, the, fabrication, tolerances, are, specified, an, exploded, view, drawing, is, used, to, lay, out, the, fabrication, sequence, simulation, packages, for, displaying, each, of, the, subassemblies, allow, the, parts, to, be, rotated, magnified, in, realistic, detail, software, packages, for, creating, the, bill, of, materials, for, construction, allows, subcontractors, to, specialize, in, assembly, processes, which, spreads, the, cost, of, manufacturing, machinery, among, multiple, customers, see, computer, aided, engineering, computer, aided, manufacturing, and, 3d, printing, an, assumption, or, axiom, is, a, statement, that, is, accepted, without, evidence, for, example, assumptions, can, be, used, as, premises, in, a, logical, argument, isaac, asimov, described, assumptions, as, follows, it, is, incorrect, to, speak, of, an, assumption, as, either, true, or, false, since, there, is, no, way, of, proving, it, to, be, either, if, there, were, it, would, no, longer, be, an, assumption, it, is, better, to, consider, assumptions, as, either, useful, or, useless, depending, on, whether, deductions, made, from, them, corresponded, to, reality, since, we, must, start, somewhere, we, must, have, assumptions, but, at, least, let, us, have, as, few, assumptions, as, possible, certain, assumptions, are, necessary, for, all, empirical, claims, e, g, the, assumption, that, reality, exists, however, theories, do, not, generally, make, assumptions, in, the, conventional, sense, statements, accepted, without, evidence, while, assumptions, are, often, incorporated, during, the, formation, of, new, theories, these, are, either, supported, by, evidence, such, as, from, previously, existing, theories, or, the, evidence, is, produced, in, the, course, of, validating, the, theory, this, may, be, as, simple, as, observing, that, the, theory, makes, accurate, predictions, which, is, evidence, that, any, assumptions, made, at, the, outset, are, correct, or, approximately, correct, under, the, conditions, tested, conventional, assumptions, without, evidence, may, be, used, if, the, theory, is, only, intended, to, apply, when, the, assumption, is, valid, or, approximately, valid, for, example, the, special, theory, of, relativity, assumes, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, the, theory, makes, accurate, predictions, when, the, assumption, is, valid, and, does, not, make, accurate, predictions, when, the, assumption, is, not, valid, such, assumptions, are, often, the, point, with, which, older, theories, are, succeeded, by, new, ones, the, general, theory, of, relativity, works, in, non, inertial, reference, frames, as, well, the, term, assumption, is, actually, broader, than, its, standard, use, etymologically, speaking, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed, and, online, wiktionary, indicate, its, latin, source, as, assumere, accept, to, take, to, oneself, adopt, usurp, which, is, a, conjunction, of, ad, to, towards, at, and, sumere, to, take, the, root, survives, with, shifted, meanings, in, the, italian, assumere, and, spanish, sumir, the, first, sense, of, assume, in, the, oed, is, to, take, unto, oneself, receive, accept, adopt, the, term, was, originally, employed, in, religious, contexts, as, in, to, receive, up, into, heaven, especially, the, reception, of, the, virgin, mary, into, heaven, with, body, preserved, from, corruption, 1297, ce, but, it, was, also, simply, used, to, refer, to, receive, into, association, or, adopt, into, partnership, moreover, other, senses, of, assumere, included, i, investing, oneself, with, an, attribute, ii, to, undertake, especially, in, law, iii, to, take, to, oneself, in, appearance, only, to, pretend, to, possess, and, iv, to, suppose, a, thing, to, be, all, senses, from, oed, entry, on, assume, the, oed, entry, for, assumption, is, almost, perfectly, symmetrical, in, senses, thus, assumption, connotes, other, associations, than, the, contemporary, standard, sense, of, that, which, is, assumed, or, taken, for, granted, a, supposition, postulate, only, the, 11th, of, 12, senses, of, assumption, and, the, 10th, of, 11, senses, of, assume, karl, popper, described, the, characteristics, of, a, scientific, theory, as, follows, popper, summarized, these, statements, by, saying, that, the, central, criterion, of, the, scientific, status, of, a, theory, is, its, falsifiability, or, refutability, or, testability, echoing, this, stephen, hawking, states, a, theory, is, a, good, theory, if, it, satisfies, two, requirements, it, must, accurately, describe, a, large, class, of, observations, on, the, basis, of, a, model, that, contains, only, a, few, arbitrary, elements, and, it, must, make, definite, predictions, about, the, results, of, future, observations, he, also, discusses, the, unprovable, but, falsifiable, nature, of, theories, which, is, a, necessary, consequence, of, inductive, logic, and, that, you, can, disprove, a, theory, by, finding, even, a, single, observation, that, disagrees, with, the, predictions, of, the, theory, several, philosophers, and, historians, of, science, have, however, argued, that, popper, s, definition, of, theory, as, a, set, of, falsifiable, statements, is, wrong, because, as, philip, kitcher, has, pointed, out, if, one, took, a, strictly, popperian, view, of, theory, observations, of, uranus, when, first, discovered, in, 1781, would, have, falsified, newton, s, celestial, mechanics, rather, people, suggested, that, another, planet, influenced, uranus, orbit, and, this, prediction, was, indeed, eventually, confirmed, kitcher, agrees, with, popper, that, there, is, surely, something, right, in, the, idea, that, a, science, can, succeed, only, if, it, can, fail, he, also, says, that, scientific, theories, include, statements, that, cannot, be, falsified, and, that, good, theories, must, also, be, creative, he, insists, we, view, scientific, theories, as, an, elaborate, collection, of, statements, some, of, which, are, not, falsifiable, while, others, those, he, calls, auxiliary, hypotheses, are, according, to, kitcher, good, scientific, theories, must, have, three, features, like, other, definitions, of, theories, including, popper, s, kitcher, makes, it, clear, that, a, theory, must, include, statements, that, have, observational, consequences, but, like, the, observation, of, irregularities, in, the, orbit, of, uranus, falsification, is, only, one, possible, consequence, of, observation, the, production, of, new, hypotheses, is, another, possible, and, equally, important, result, the, concept, of, a, scientific, theory, has, also, been, described, using, analogies, and, metaphors, for, example, the, logical, empiricist, carl, gustav, hempel, likened, the, structure, of, a, scientific, theory, to, a, complex, spatial, network, its, terms, are, represented, by, the, knots, while, the, threads, connecting, the, latter, correspond, in, part, to, the, definitions, and, in, part, to, the, fundamental, and, derivative, hypotheses, included, in, the, theory, the, whole, system, floats, as, it, were, above, the, plane, of, observation, and, is, anchored, to, it, by, the, rules, of, interpretation, these, might, be, viewed, as, strings, which, are, not, part, of, the, network, but, link, certain, points, of, the, latter, with, specific, places, in, the, plane, of, observation, by, virtue, of, these, interpretive, connections, the, network, can, function, as, a, scientific, theory, from, certain, observational, data, we, may, ascend, via, an, interpretive, string, to, some, point, in, the, theoretical, network, thence, proceed, via, definitions, and, hypotheses, to, other, points, from, which, another, interpretive, string, permits, a, descent, to, the, plane, of, observation, michael, polanyi, made, an, analogy, between, a, theory, and, a, map, a, theory, is, something, other, than, myself, it, may, be, set, out, on, paper, as, a, system, of, rules, and, it, is, the, more, truly, a, theory, the, more, completely, it, can, be, put, down, in, such, terms, mathematical, theory, reaches, the, highest, perfection, in, this, respect, but, even, a, geographical, map, fully, embodies, in, itself, a, set, of, strict, rules, for, finding, one, s, way, through, a, region, of, otherwise, uncharted, experience, indeed, all, theory, may, be, regarded, as, a, kind, of, map, extended, over, space, and, time, a, scientific, theory, can, also, be, thought, of, as, a, book, that, captures, the, fundamental, information, about, the, world, a, book, that, must, be, researched, written, and, shared, in, 1623, galileo, galilei, wrote, philosophy, is, written, in, this, grand, book, i, mean, the, universe, which, stands, continually, open, to, our, gaze, but, it, cannot, be, understood, unless, one, first, learns, to, comprehend, the, language, and, interpret, the, characters, in, which, it, is, written, it, is, written, in, the, language, of, mathematics, and, its, characters, are, triangles, circles, and, other, geometrical, figures, without, which, it, is, humanly, impossible, to, understand, a, single, word, of, it, without, these, one, is, wandering, around, in, a, dark, labyrinth, the, book, metaphor, could, also, be, applied, in, the, following, passage, by, the, contemporary, philosopher, of, science, ian, hacking, i, myself, prefer, an, argentine, fantasy, god, did, not, write, a, book, of, nature, of, the, sort, that, the, old, europeans, imagined, he, wrote, a, borgesian, library, each, book, of, which, is, as, brief, as, possible, yet, each, book, of, which, is, inconsistent, with, every, other, no, book, is, redundant, for, every, book, there, is, some, humanly, accessible, bit, of, nature, such, that, that, book, and, no, other, makes, possible, the, comprehension, prediction, and, influencing, of, what, is, going, on, leibniz, said, that, god, chose, a, world, which, maximized, the, variety, of, phenomena, while, choosing, the, simplest, laws, exactly, so, but, the, best, way, to, maximize, phenomena, and, have, simplest, laws, is, to, have, the, laws, inconsistent, with, each, other, each, applying, to, this, or, that, but, none, applying, to, all, in, physics, the, term, theory, is, generally, used, for, a, mathematical, framework, derived, from, a, small, set, of, basic, postulates, usually, symmetries, like, equality, of, locations, in, space, or, in, time, or, identity, of, electrons, etc, that, is, capable, of, producing, experimental, predictions, for, a, given, category, of, physical, systems, a, good, example, is, classical, electromagnetism, which, encompasses, results, derived, from, gauge, symmetry, sometimes, called, gauge, invariance, in, a, form, of, a, few, equations, called, maxwell, s, equations, the, specific, mathematical, aspects, of, classical, electromagnetic, theory, are, termed, laws, of, electromagnetism, reflecting, the, level, of, consistent, and, reproducible, evidence, that, supports, them, within, electromagnetic, theory, generally, there, are, numerous, hypotheses, about, how, electromagnetism, applies, to, specific, situations, many, of, these, hypotheses, are, already, considered, to, be, adequately, tested, with, new, ones, always, in, the, making, and, perhaps, untested, an, example, of, the, latter, might, be, the, radiation, reaction, force, as, of, 2009, its, effects, on, the, periodic, motion, of, charges, are, detectable, in, synchrotrons, but, only, as, averaged, effects, over, time, some, researchers, are, now, considering, experiments, that, could, observe, these, effects, at, the, instantaneous, level, i, e, not, averaged, over, time, note, that, many, fields, of, inquiry, do, not, have, specific, named, theories, e, g, developmental, biology, scientific, knowledge, outside, a, named, theory, can, still, have, a, high, level, of, certainty, depending, on, the, amount, of, evidence, supporting, it, also, note, that, since, theories, draw, evidence, from, many, fields, the, categorization, is, not, absolute
