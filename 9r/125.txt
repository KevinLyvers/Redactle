the, galactic, center, is, the, barycenter, of, the, milky, way, and, a, corresponding, point, on, the, rotational, axis, of, the, galaxy, its, central, massive, object, is, a, supermassive, black, hole, of, about, 4, million, solar, masses, which, is, called, sagittarius, a, a, compact, radio, source, which, is, almost, exactly, at, the, galactic, rotational, center, the, galactic, center, is, approximately, 8, kiloparsecs, 26, 000, ly, away, from, earth, in, the, direction, of, the, constellations, sagittarius, ophiuchus, and, scorpius, where, the, milky, way, appears, brightest, visually, close, to, the, butterfly, cluster, m6, or, the, star, shaula, south, to, the, pipe, nebula, there, are, around, 10, million, stars, within, one, parsec, of, the, galactic, center, dominated, by, red, giants, with, a, significant, population, of, massive, supergiants, and, wolf, rayet, stars, from, star, formation, in, the, region, around, 1, million, years, ago, the, core, stars, are, a, small, part, within, the, much, wider, galactic, bulge, because, of, interstellar, dust, along, the, line, of, sight, the, galactic, center, cannot, be, studied, at, visible, ultraviolet, or, soft, low, energy, x, ray, wavelengths, the, available, information, about, the, galactic, center, comes, from, observations, at, gamma, ray, hard, high, energy, x, ray, infrared, submillimetre, and, radio, wavelengths, immanuel, kant, stated, in, universal, natural, history, and, theory, of, the, heavens, 1755, that, a, large, star, was, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, that, sirius, might, be, the, star, harlow, shapley, stated, in, 1918, that, the, halo, of, globular, clusters, surrounding, the, milky, way, seemed, to, be, centered, on, the, star, swarms, in, the, constellation, of, sagittarius, but, the, dark, molecular, clouds, in, the, area, blocked, the, view, for, optical, astronomy, in, the, early, 1940s, walter, baade, at, mount, wilson, observatory, took, advantage, of, wartime, blackout, conditions, in, nearby, los, angeles, to, conduct, a, search, for, the, center, with, the, 100, inch, 250, cm, hooker, telescope, he, found, that, near, the, star, alnasl, gamma, sagittarii, there, is, a, one, degree, wide, void, in, the, interstellar, dust, lanes, which, provides, a, relatively, clear, view, of, the, swarms, of, stars, around, the, nucleus, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, this, gap, has, been, known, as, baade, s, window, ever, since, at, dover, heights, in, sydney, australia, a, team, of, radio, astronomers, from, the, division, of, radiophysics, at, the, csiro, led, by, joseph, lade, pawsey, used, sea, interferometry, to, discover, some, of, the, first, interstellar, and, intergalactic, radio, sources, including, taurus, a, virgo, a, and, centaurus, a, by, 1954, they, had, built, an, 80, foot, 24, m, fixed, dish, antenna, and, used, it, to, make, a, detailed, study, of, an, extended, extremely, powerful, belt, of, radio, emission, that, was, detected, in, sagittarius, they, named, an, intense, point, source, near, the, center, of, this, belt, sagittarius, a, and, realised, that, it, was, located, at, the, very, center, of, the, galaxy, despite, being, some, 32, degrees, south, west, of, the, conjectured, galactic, center, of, the, time, in, 1958, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, decided, to, adopt, the, position, of, sagittarius, a, as, the, true, zero, coordinate, point, for, the, system, of, galactic, latitude, and, longitude, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, location, is, ra, 17, h, 45, m, 40, 04, s, dec, 29, 00, 28, 1, j2000, epoch, in, july, 2022, astronomers, reported, the, discovery, of, massive, amounts, of, prebiotic, molecules, including, some, associated, with, rna, in, the, galactic, center, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, exact, distance, between, the, solar, system, and, the, galactic, center, is, not, certain, although, estimates, since, 2000, have, remained, within, the, range, 24, 28, 4, kilolight, years, 7, 4, 8, 7, kiloparsecs, the, latest, estimates, from, geometric, based, methods, and, standard, candles, yield, the, following, distances, to, the, galactic, center, an, accurate, determination, of, the, distance, to, the, galactic, center, as, established, from, variable, stars, e, g, rr, lyrae, variables, or, standard, candles, e, g, red, clump, stars, is, hindered, by, numerous, effects, which, include, an, ambiguous, reddening, law, a, bias, for, smaller, values, of, the, distance, to, the, galactic, center, because, of, a, preferential, sampling, of, stars, toward, the, near, side, of, the, galactic, bulge, owing, to, interstellar, extinction, and, an, uncertainty, in, characterizing, how, a, mean, distance, to, a, group, of, variable, stars, found, in, the, direction, of, the, galactic, bulge, relates, to, the, distance, to, the, galactic, center, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, s, bar, which, extends, across, the, galactic, center, is, also, actively, debated, with, estimates, for, its, half, length, and, orientation, spanning, between, 1, 5, kpc, short, or, a, long, bar, and, 10, 50, certain, authors, advocate, that, the, milky, way, features, two, distinct, bars, one, nestled, within, the, other, the, bar, is, delineated, by, red, clump, stars, see, also, red, giant, however, rr, lyrae, variables, do, not, trace, a, prominent, galactic, bar, the, bar, may, be, surrounded, by, a, ring, called, the, 5, kpc, ring, that, contains, a, large, fraction, of, the, molecular, hydrogen, present, in, the, milky, way, and, most, of, the, milky, way, s, star, formation, activity, viewed, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, it, would, be, the, brightest, feature, of, the, milky, way, the, complex, astronomical, radio, source, sagittarius, a, appears, to, be, located, almost, exactly, at, the, galactic, center, and, contains, an, intense, compact, radio, source, sagittarius, a, which, coincides, with, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, accretion, of, gas, onto, the, black, hole, probably, involving, an, accretion, disk, around, it, would, release, energy, to, power, the, radio, source, itself, much, larger, than, the, black, hole, a, study, in, 2008, which, linked, radio, telescopes, in, hawaii, arizona, and, california, very, long, baseline, interferometry, measured, the, diameter, of, sagittarius, a, to, be, 44, million, kilometers, 0, 3, au, for, comparison, the, radius, of, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, is, about, 150, million, kilometers, 1, 0, au, whereas, the, distance, of, mercury, from, the, sun, at, closest, approach, perihelion, is, 46, million, kilometers, 0, 3, au, thus, the, diameter, of, the, radio, source, is, slightly, less, than, the, distance, from, mercury, to, the, sun, scientists, at, the, max, planck, institute, for, extraterrestrial, physics, in, germany, using, chilean, telescopes, have, confirmed, the, existence, of, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, galactic, center, on, the, order, of, 4, 3, million, solar, masses, later, studies, have, estimated, a, mass, of, 3, 7, million, or, 4, 1, million, solar, masses, on, 5, january, 2015, nasa, reported, observing, an, x, ray, flare, 400, times, brighter, than, usual, a, record, breaker, from, sagittarius, a, the, unusual, event, may, have, been, caused, by, the, breaking, apart, of, an, asteroid, falling, into, the, black, hole, or, by, the, entanglement, of, magnetic, field, lines, within, gas, flowing, into, sagittarius, a, according, to, astronomers, in, november, 2010, it, was, announced, that, two, large, elliptical, lobe, structures, of, energetic, plasma, termed, bubbles, which, emit, gamma, and, x, rays, were, detected, astride, the, milky, way, galaxy, s, core, termed, fermi, or, erosita, bubbles, they, extend, up, to, about, 25, 000, light, years, above, and, below, the, galactic, center, the, galaxy, s, diffuse, gamma, ray, fog, hampered, prior, observations, but, the, discovery, team, led, by, d, finkbeiner, building, on, research, by, g, dobler, worked, around, this, problem, the, 2014, bruno, rossi, prize, went, to, tracy, slatyer, douglas, finkbeiner, and, meng, su, for, their, discovery, in, gamma, rays, of, the, large, unanticipated, galactic, structure, called, the, fermi, bubbles, the, origin, of, the, bubbles, is, being, researched, the, bubbles, are, connected, and, seemingly, coupled, via, energy, transport, to, the, galactic, core, by, columnar, structures, of, energetic, plasma, termed, chimneys, in, 2020, for, the, first, time, the, lobes, were, seen, in, visible, light, and, optical, measurements, were, made, by, 2022, detailed, computer, simulations, further, confirmed, that, the, bubbles, were, caused, by, the, sagittarius, a, black, hole, the, central, cubic, parsec, around, sagittarius, a, contains, around, 10, million, stars, although, most, of, them, are, old, red, giant, stars, the, galactic, center, is, also, rich, in, massive, stars, more, than, 100, ob, and, wolf, rayet, stars, have, been, identified, there, so, far, they, seem, to, have, all, been, formed, in, a, single, star, formation, event, a, few, million, years, ago, the, existence, of, these, relatively, young, stars, was, a, surprise, to, experts, who, expected, the, tidal, forces, from, the, central, black, hole, to, prevent, their, formation, this, paradox, of, youth, is, even, stronger, for, stars, that, are, on, very, tight, orbits, around, sagittarius, a, such, as, s2, and, s0, 102, the, scenarios, invoked, to, explain, this, formation, involve, either, star, formation, in, a, massive, star, cluster, offset, from, the, galactic, center, that, would, have, migrated, to, its, current, location, once, formed, or, star, formation, within, a, massive, compact, gas, accretion, disk, around, the, central, black, hole, current, evidence, favors, the, latter, theory, as, formation, through, a, large, accretion, disk, is, more, likely, to, lead, to, the, observed, discrete, edge, of, the, young, stellar, cluster, at, roughly, 0, 5, parsec, most, of, these, 100, young, massive, stars, seem, to, be, concentrated, within, one, or, two, disks, rather, than, randomly, distributed, within, the, central, parsec, this, observation, however, does, not, allow, definite, conclusions, to, be, drawn, at, this, point, star, formation, does, not, seem, to, be, occurring, currently, at, the, galactic, center, although, the, circumnuclear, disk, of, molecular, gas, that, orbits, the, galactic, center, at, two, parsecs, seems, a, fairly, favorable, site, for, star, formation, work, presented, in, 2002, by, antony, stark, and, chris, martin, mapping, the, gas, density, in, a, 400, light, year, region, around, the, galactic, center, has, revealed, an, accumulating, ring, with, a, mass, several, million, times, that, of, the, sun, and, near, the, critical, density, for, star, formation, they, predict, that, in, approximately, 200, million, years, there, will, be, an, episode, of, starburst, in, the, galactic, center, with, many, stars, forming, rapidly, and, undergoing, supernovae, at, a, hundred, times, the, current, rate, this, starburst, may, also, be, accompanied, by, the, formation, of, galactic, relativistic, jets, as, matter, falls, into, the, central, black, hole, it, is, thought, that, the, milky, way, undergoes, a, starburst, of, this, sort, every, 500, million, years, in, addition, to, the, paradox, of, youth, there, is, a, conundrum, of, old, age, associated, with, the, distribution, of, the, old, stars, at, the, galactic, center, theoretical, models, had, predicted, that, the, old, stars, which, far, outnumber, young, stars, should, have, a, steeply, rising, density, near, the, black, hole, a, so, called, bahcall, wolf, cusp, instead, it, was, discovered, in, 2009, that, the, density, of, the, old, stars, peaks, at, a, distance, of, roughly, 0, 5, parsec, from, sgr, a, then, falls, inward, instead, of, a, dense, cluster, there, is, a, hole, or, core, around, the, black, hole, several, suggestions, have, been, put, forward, to, explain, this, puzzling, observation, but, none, is, completely, satisfactory, for, instance, although, the, black, hole, would, eat, stars, near, it, creating, a, region, of, low, density, this, region, would, be, much, smaller, than, a, parsec, because, the, observed, stars, are, a, fraction, of, the, total, number, it, is, theoretically, possible, that, the, overall, stellar, distribution, is, different, from, what, is, observed, although, no, plausible, models, of, this, sort, have, been, proposed, yet, in, may, 2021, nasa, published, new, images, of, the, galactic, center, based, on, surveys, from, chandra, x, ray, observatory, and, other, telescopes, images, are, about, 2, 2, degrees, 1, 000, light, years, across, and, 4, 2, degrees, 2, 000, light, years, long, press
