the, crab, nebula, catalogue, designations, m1, ngc, 1952, taurus, a, is, a, supernova, remnant, and, pulsar, wind, nebula, in, the, constellation, of, taurus, the, common, name, comes, from, a, drawing, that, somewhat, resembled, a, crab, with, arms, produced, by, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, in, 1842, or, 1843, using, a, 36, inch, 91, cm, telescope, the, nebula, was, discovered, by, english, astronomer, john, bevis, in, 1731, it, corresponds, with, a, bright, supernova, recorded, by, chinese, astronomers, in, 1054, as, a, guest, star, the, nebula, was, the, first, astronomical, object, identified, that, corresponds, with, a, historically, observed, supernova, explosion, at, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 8, 4, comparable, to, that, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, it, is, not, visible, to, the, naked, eye, but, can, be, made, out, using, binoculars, under, favourable, conditions, the, nebula, lies, in, the, perseus, arm, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, at, a, distance, of, about, 2, 0, kiloparsecs, 6, 500, ly, from, earth, it, has, a, diameter, of, 3, 4, parsecs, 11, ly, corresponding, to, an, apparent, diameter, of, some, 7, arcminutes, and, is, expanding, at, a, rate, of, about, 1, 500, kilometres, per, second, 930, mi, s, or, 0, 5, of, the, speed, of, light, at, the, center, of, the, nebula, lies, the, crab, pulsar, a, neutron, star, 28, 30, kilometres, 17, 19, mi, across, with, a, spin, rate, of, 30, 2, times, per, second, which, emits, pulses, of, radiation, from, gamma, rays, to, radio, waves, at, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, energies, above, 30, kev, the, crab, nebula, is, generally, the, brightest, persistent, gamma, ray, source, in, the, sky, with, measured, flux, extending, to, above, 10, tev, the, nebula, s, radiation, allows, detailed, study, of, celestial, bodies, that, occult, it, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, sun, s, corona, was, mapped, from, observations, of, the, crab, nebula, s, radio, waves, passing, through, it, and, in, 2003, the, thickness, of, the, atmosphere, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, was, measured, as, it, blocked, out, x, rays, from, the, nebula, the, earliest, recorded, documentation, of, observation, of, astronomical, object, sn, 1054, was, as, it, was, occurring, in, 1054, by, chinese, astrononomers, and, japanese, observers, hence, its, numerical, identification, modern, understanding, that, the, crab, nebula, was, created, by, a, supernova, traces, back, to, 1921, when, carl, otto, lampland, announced, he, had, seen, changes, in, the, nebula, s, structure, this, eventually, led, to, the, conclusion, that, the, creation, of, the, crab, nebula, corresponds, to, the, bright, sn, 1054, supernova, recorded, by, medieval, astronomers, in, ad, 1054, the, crab, nebula, was, first, identified, in, 1731, by, john, bevis, the, nebula, was, independently, rediscovered, in, 1758, by, charles, messier, as, he, was, observing, a, bright, comet, messier, catalogued, it, as, the, first, entry, in, his, catalogue, of, comet, like, objects, in, 1757, alexis, clairaut, reexamined, the, calculations, of, edmund, halley, and, predicted, the, return, of, halley, s, comet, in, late, 1758, the, exact, time, of, the, comet, s, return, required, the, consideration, of, perturbations, to, its, orbit, caused, by, planets, in, the, solar, system, such, as, jupiter, which, clairaut, and, his, two, colleagues, j, r, me, lalande, and, nicole, reine, lepaute, carried, out, more, precisely, than, halley, finding, that, the, comet, should, appear, in, the, constellation, of, taurus, it, was, in, searching, in, vain, for, the, comet, that, charles, messier, found, the, crab, nebula, which, he, at, first, thought, to, be, halley, s, comet, after, some, observation, noticing, that, the, object, that, he, was, observing, was, not, moving, across, the, sky, messier, concluded, that, the, object, was, not, a, comet, messier, then, realised, the, usefulness, of, compiling, a, catalogue, of, celestial, objects, of, a, cloudy, nature, but, fixed, in, the, sky, to, avoid, incorrectly, cataloguing, them, as, comets, this, realization, led, him, to, compile, the, messier, catalogue, william, herschel, observed, the, crab, nebula, numerous, times, between, 1783, and, 1809, but, it, is, not, known, whether, he, was, aware, of, its, existence, in, 1783, or, if, he, discovered, it, independently, of, messier, and, bevis, after, several, observations, he, concluded, that, it, was, composed, of, a, group, of, stars, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, observed, the, nebula, at, birr, castle, in, the, early, 1840s, using, a, 36, inch, 0, 9, m, telescope, and, made, a, drawing, of, it, that, showed, it, with, arms, like, those, of, a, crab, he, observed, it, again, later, in, 1848, using, a, 72, inch, 1, 8, m, telescope, but, could, not, confirm, the, supposed, resemblance, but, the, name, stuck, nevertheless, the, crab, nebula, was, the, first, astronomical, object, recognized, as, being, connected, to, a, supernova, explosion, in, the, early, twentieth, century, the, analysis, of, early, photographs, of, the, nebula, taken, several, years, apart, revealed, that, it, was, expanding, tracing, the, expansion, back, revealed, that, the, nebula, must, have, become, visible, on, earth, about, 900, years, before, historical, records, revealed, that, a, new, star, bright, enough, to, be, seen, in, the, daytime, had, been, recorded, in, the, same, part, of, the, sky, by, chinese, astronomers, on, 4, july, 1054, and, probably, also, by, japanese, observers, in, 1913, when, vesto, slipher, registered, his, spectroscopy, study, of, the, sky, the, crab, nebula, was, again, one, of, the, first, objects, to, be, studied, changes, in, the, cloud, suggesting, its, small, extent, were, discovered, by, carl, lampland, in, 1921, that, same, year, john, charles, duncan, demonstrated, that, the, remnant, was, expanding, while, knut, lundmark, noted, its, proximity, to, the, guest, star, of, 1054, in, 1928, edwin, hubble, proposed, associating, the, cloud, with, the, star, of, 1054, an, idea, that, remained, controversial, until, the, nature, of, supernovae, was, understood, and, it, was, nicholas, mayall, who, indicated, that, the, star, of, 1054, was, undoubtedly, the, supernova, whose, explosion, produced, the, crab, nebula, the, search, for, historical, supernovae, started, at, that, moment, seven, other, historical, sightings, have, been, found, by, comparing, modern, observations, of, supernova, remnants, with, astronomical, documents, of, past, centuries, after, the, original, connection, to, chinese, observations, in, 1934, connections, were, made, to, a, 13th, century, japanese, reference, to, a, guest, star, in, meigetsuki, a, few, weeks, before, the, chinese, reference, the, event, was, long, considered, unrecorded, in, islamic, astronomy, but, in, 1978, a, reference, was, found, in, a, 13th, century, copy, made, by, ibn, abi, usaibia, of, a, work, by, ibn, butlan, a, nestorian, christian, physician, active, in, baghdad, at, the, time, of, the, supernova, given, its, great, distance, the, daytime, guest, star, observed, by, the, chinese, could, only, have, been, a, supernova, a, massive, exploding, star, having, exhausted, its, supply, of, energy, from, nuclear, fusion, and, collapsed, in, on, itself, recent, analysis, of, historical, records, have, found, that, the, supernova, that, created, the, crab, nebula, probably, appeared, in, april, or, early, may, rising, to, its, maximum, brightness, of, between, apparent, magnitude, 7, and, 4, 5, brighter, even, than, venus, 4, 2, and, everything, in, the, night, sky, except, the, moon, by, july, the, supernova, was, visible, to, the, naked, eye, for, about, two, years, after, its, first, observation, in, the, 1960s, because, of, the, prediction, and, discovery, of, pulsars, the, crab, nebula, again, became, a, major, center, of, interest, it, was, then, that, franco, pacini, predicted, the, existence, of, the, crab, pulsar, for, the, first, time, which, would, explain, the, brightness, of, the, cloud, in, late, 1968, david, h, staelin, and, edward, c, reifenstein, iii, reported, the, discovery, of, two, rapidly, variable, radio, sources, in, the, area, of, the, crab, nebula, using, the, green, bank, telescope, they, named, them, np, 0527, and, np, 0532, the, period, of, 33, milliseconds, and, precise, location, of, the, crab, nebula, pulsar, np, 0532, was, discovered, by, richard, v, e, lovelace, and, collaborators, on, 10, november, 1968, at, the, arecibo, radio, observatory, this, discovery, also, proved, that, pulsars, are, rotating, neutron, stars, not, pulsating, white, dwarfs, as, many, scientists, suggested, soon, after, the, discovery, of, the, crab, pulsar, david, richards, discovered, using, the, arecibo, observatory, that, the, crab, pulsar, spins, down, and, therefore, the, pulsar, loses, its, rotational, energy, thomas, gold, has, shown, that, the, spin, down, power, of, the, pulsar, is, sufficient, to, power, the, crab, nebula, the, discovery, of, the, crab, pulsar, and, the, knowledge, of, its, exact, age, almost, to, the, day, allows, for, the, verification, of, basic, physical, properties, of, these, objects, such, as, characteristic, age, and, spin, down, luminosity, the, orders, of, magnitude, involved, notably, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, along, with, various, aspects, related, to, the, dynamics, of, the, remnant, the, role, of, this, supernova, to, the, scientific, understanding, of, supernova, remnants, was, crucial, as, no, other, historical, supernova, created, a, pulsar, whose, precise, age, is, known, for, certain, the, only, possible, exception, to, this, rule, would, be, sn, 1181, whose, supposed, remnant, 3c, 58, is, home, to, a, pulsar, but, its, identification, using, chinese, observations, from, 1181, is, contested, the, inner, part, of, the, crab, nebula, is, dominated, by, a, pulsar, wind, nebula, enveloping, the, pulsar, some, sources, consider, the, crab, nebula, to, be, an, example, of, both, a, pulsar, wind, nebula, as, well, as, a, supernova, remnant, while, others, separate, the, two, phenomena, based, on, the, different, sources, of, energy, production, and, behaviour, the, crab, nebula, was, the, first, astrophysical, object, confirmed, to, emit, gamma, rays, in, the, very, high, energy, vhe, band, above, 100, gev, in, energy, the, vhe, detection, was, carried, out, in, 1989, by, the, whipple, observatory, 10m, gamma, ray, telescope, which, opened, the, vhe, gamma, ray, window, and, led, to, the, detection, of, numerous, vhe, sources, since, then, in, 2019, the, crab, nebula, was, observed, to, emit, gamma, rays, in, excess, of, 100, tev, making, it, the, first, identified, source, beyond, 100, tev, in, visible, light, the, crab, nebula, consists, of, a, broadly, oval, shaped, mass, of, filaments, about, 6, arcminutes, long, and, 4, arcminutes, wide, by, comparison, the, full, moon, is, 30, arcminutes, across, surrounding, a, diffuse, blue, central, region, in, three, dimensions, the, nebula, is, thought, to, be, shaped, either, like, an, oblate, spheroid, estimated, as, 1, 380, pc, 4, 500, ly, away, or, a, prolate, spheroid, estimated, as, 2, 020, pc, 6, 600, ly, away, the, filaments, are, the, remnants, of, the, progenitor, star, s, atmosphere, and, consist, largely, of, ionised, helium, and, hydrogen, along, with, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon, and, sulfur, the, filaments, temperatures, are, typically, between, 11, 000, and, 18, 000, k, and, their, densities, are, about, 1, 300, particles, per, cm, 3, in, 1953, iosif, shklovsky, proposed, that, the, diffuse, blue, region, is, predominantly, produced, by, synchrotron, radiation, which, is, radiation, given, off, by, the, curving, motion, of, electrons, in, a, magnetic, field, the, radiation, corresponded, to, electrons, moving, at, speeds, up, to, half, the, speed, of, light, three, years, later, the, hypothesis, was, confirmed, by, observations, in, the, 1960s, it, was, found, that, the, source, of, the, curved, paths, of, the, electrons, was, the, strong, magnetic, field, produced, by, a, neutron, star, at, the, centre, of, the, nebula, even, though, the, crab, nebula, is, the, focus, of, much, attention, among, astronomers, its, distance, remains, an, open, question, owing, to, uncertainties, in, every, method, used, to, estimate, its, distance, in, 2008, the, consensus, was, that, its, distance, from, earth, is, 2, 0, 0, 5, kpc, 6, 500, 1, 600, ly, along, its, longest, visible, dimension, it, thus, measures, about, 4, 1, 1, pc, 13, 3, ly, across, the, crab, nebula, currently, is, expanding, outward, at, about, 1, 500, km, s, 930, mi, s, images, taken, several, years, apart, reveal, the, slow, expansion, of, the, nebula, and, by, comparing, this, angular, expansion, with, its, spectroscopically, determined, expansion, velocity, the, nebula, s, distance, can, be, estimated, in, 1973, an, analysis, of, many, methods, used, to, compute, the, distance, to, the, nebula, had, reached, a, conclusion, of, about, 1, 9, kpc, 6, 300, ly, consistent, with, the, currently, cited, value, tracing, back, its, expansion, assuming, a, constant, decrease, of, expansion, speed, due, to, the, nebula, s, mass, yielded, a, date, for, the, creation, of, the, nebula, several, decades, after, 1054, implying, that, its, outward, velocity, has, decelerated, less, than, assumed, since, the, supernova, explosion, this, reduced, deceleration, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, energy, from, the, pulsar, that, feeds, into, the, nebula, s, magnetic, field, which, expands, and, forces, the, nebula, s, filaments, outward, estimates, of, the, total, mass, of, the, nebula, are, important, for, estimating, the, mass, of, the, supernova, s, progenitor, star, the, amount, of, matter, contained, in, the, crab, nebula, s, filaments, ejecta, mass, of, ionized, and, neutral, gas, mostly, helium, is, estimated, to, be, 4, 6, 1, 8, m, one, of, the, many, nebular, components, or, anomalies, of, the, crab, nebula, is, a, helium, rich, torus, which, is, visible, as, an, east, west, band, crossing, the, pulsar, region, the, torus, composes, about, 25, of, the, visible, ejecta, however, it, is, suggested, by, calculation, that, about, 95, of, the, torus, is, helium, as, yet, there, has, been, no, plausible, explanation, put, forth, for, the, structure, of, the, torus, at, the, center, of, the, crab, nebula, are, two, faint, stars, one, of, which, is, the, star, responsible, for, the, existence, of, the, nebula, it, was, identified, as, such, in, 1942, when, rudolf, minkowski, found, that, its, optical, spectrum, was, extremely, unusual, the, region, around, the, star, was, found, to, be, a, strong, source, of, radio, waves, in, 1949, and, x, rays, in, 1963, and, was, identified, as, one, of, the, brightest, objects, in, the, sky, in, gamma, rays, in, 1967, then, in, 1968, the, star, was, found, to, be, emitting, its, radiation, in, rapid, pulses, becoming, one, of, the, first, pulsars, to, be, discovered, pulsars, are, sources, of, powerful, electromagnetic, radiation, emitted, in, short, and, extremely, regular, pulses, many, times, a, second, they, were, a, great, mystery, when, discovered, in, 1967, and, the, team, who, identified, the, first, one, considered, the, possibility, that, it, could, be, a, signal, from, an, advanced, civilization, however, the, discovery, of, a, pulsating, radio, source, in, the, centre, of, the, crab, nebula, was, strong, evidence, that, pulsars, were, formed, by, supernova, explosions, they, now, are, understood, to, be, rapidly, rotating, neutron, stars, whose, powerful, magnetic, fields, concentrates, their, radiation, emissions, into, narrow, beams, the, crab, pulsar, is, believed, to, be, about, 28, 30, km, 17, 19, mi, in, diameter, it, emits, pulses, of, radiation, every, 33, milliseconds, pulses, are, emitted, at, wavelengths, across, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, from, radio, waves, to, x, rays, like, all, isolated, pulsars, its, period, is, slowing, very, gradually, occasionally, its, rotational, period, shows, sharp, changes, known, as, glitches, which, are, believed, to, be, caused, by, a, sudden, realignment, inside, the, neutron, star, the, energy, released, as, the, pulsar, slows, down, is, enormous, and, it, powers, the, emission, of, the, synchrotron, radiation, of, the, crab, nebula, which, has, a, total, luminosity, about, 75, 000, times, greater, than, that, of, the, sun, the, pulsar, s, extreme, energy, output, creates, an, unusually, dynamic, region, at, the, centre, of, the, crab, nebula, while, most, astronomical, objects, evolve, so, slowly, that, changes, are, visible, only, over, timescales, of, many, years, the, inner, parts, of, the, crab, nebula, show, changes, over, timescales, of, only, a, few, days, the, most, dynamic, feature, in, the, inner, part, of, the, nebula, is, the, point, where, the, pulsar, s, equatorial, wind, slams, into, the, bulk, of, the, nebula, forming, a, shock, front, the, shape, and, position, of, this, feature, shifts, rapidly, with, the, equatorial, wind, appearing, as, a, series, of, wisp, like, features, that, steepen, brighten, then, fade, as, they, move, away, from, the, pulsar, to, well, out, into, the, main, body, of, the, nebula, the, star, that, exploded, as, a, supernova, is, referred, to, as, the, supernova, s, progenitor, star, two, types, of, stars, explode, as, supernovae, white, dwarfs, and, massive, stars, in, the, so, called, type, ia, supernovae, gases, falling, onto, a, dead, white, dwarf, raise, its, mass, until, it, nears, a, critical, level, the, chandrasekhar, limit, resulting, in, a, runaway, nuclear, fusion, explosion, that, obliterates, the, star, in, type, ib, c, and, type, ii, supernovae, the, progenitor, star, is, a, massive, star, whose, core, runs, out, of, fuel, to, power, its, nuclear, fusion, reactions, and, collapses, in, on, itself, releasing, gravitational, potential, energy, in, a, form, that, blows, away, the, star, s, outer, layers, type, ia, supernovae, do, not, produce, pulsars, so, the, pulsar, in, the, crab, nebula, shows, it, must, have, formed, in, a, core, collapse, supernova, theoretical, models, of, supernova, explosions, suggest, that, the, star, that, exploded, to, produce, the, crab, nebula, must, have, had, a, mass, of, between, 9, and, 11, m, stars, with, masses, lower, than, 8, m, are, thought, to, be, too, small, to, produce, supernova, explosions, and, end, their, lives, by, producing, a, planetary, nebula, instead, while, a, star, heavier, than, 12, m, would, have, produced, a, nebula, with, a, different, chemical, composition, from, that, observed, in, the, crab, nebula, recent, studies, however, suggest, the, progenitor, could, have, been, a, super, asymptotic, giant, branch, star, in, the, 8, to, 10, m, range, that, would, have, exploded, in, an, electron, capture, supernova, in, june, 2021, a, paper, in, the, journal, nature, astronomy, reported, that, the, 2018, supernova, sn, 2018zd, in, the, galaxy, ngc, 2146, about, 31, million, light, years, from, earth, appeared, to, be, the, first, observation, of, an, electron, capture, supernova, the, 1054, supernova, explosion, that, created, the, crab, nebula, had, been, thought, to, be, the, best, candidate, for, an, electron, capture, supernova, and, the, 2021, paper, makes, it, more, likely, that, this, was, correct, a, significant, problem, in, studies, of, the, crab, nebula, is, that, the, combined, mass, of, the, nebula, and, the, pulsar, add, up, to, considerably, less, than, the, predicted, mass, of, the, progenitor, star, and, the, question, of, where, the, missing, mass, is, remains, unresolved, estimates, of, the, mass, of, the, nebula, are, made, by, measuring, the, total, amount, of, light, emitted, and, calculating, the, mass, required, given, the, measured, temperature, and, density, of, the, nebula, estimates, range, from, about, 1, 5, m, with, 2, 3, m, being, the, generally, accepted, value, the, neutron, star, mass, is, estimated, to, be, between, 1, 4, and, 2, m, the, predominant, theory, to, account, for, the, missing, mass, of, the, crab, nebula, is, that, a, substantial, proportion, of, the, mass, of, the, progenitor, was, carried, away, before, the, supernova, explosion, in, a, fast, stellar, wind, a, phenomenon, commonly, seen, in, wolf, rayet, stars, however, this, would, have, created, a, shell, around, the, nebula, although, attempts, have, been, made, at, several, wavelengths, to, observe, a, shell, none, has, yet, been, found, the, crab, nebula, lies, roughly, 1, 5, degrees, away, from, the, ecliptic, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, this, means, that, the, moon, and, occasionally, planets, can, transit, or, occult, the, nebula, although, the, sun, does, not, transit, the, nebula, its, corona, passes, in, front, of, it, these, transits, and, occultations, can, be, used, to, analyse, both, the, nebula, and, the, object, passing, in, front, of, it, by, observing, how, radiation, from, the, nebula, is, altered, by, the, transiting, body, lunar, transits, have, been, used, to, map, x, ray, emissions, from, the, nebula, before, the, launch, of, x, ray, observing, satellites, such, as, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, x, ray, observations, generally, had, quite, low, angular, resolution, but, when, the, moon, passes, in, front, of, the, nebula, its, position, is, very, accurately, known, and, so, the, variations, in, the, nebula, s, brightness, can, be, used, to, create, maps, of, x, ray, emission, when, x, rays, were, first, observed, from, the, crab, nebula, a, lunar, occultation, was, used, to, determine, the, exact, location, of, their, source, the, sun, s, corona, passes, in, front, of, the, crab, nebula, every, june, variations, in, the, radio, waves, received, from, the, crab, nebula, at, this, time, can, be, used, to, infer, details, about, the, corona, s, density, and, structure, early, observations, established, that, the, corona, extended, out, to, much, greater, distances, than, had, previously, been, thought, later, observations, found, that, the, corona, contained, substantial, density, variations, very, rarely, saturn, transits, the, crab, nebula, its, transit, on, 4, january, 2003, utc, was, the, first, since, 31, december, 1295, o, s, another, will, not, occur, until, 5, august, 2267, researchers, used, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, to, observe, saturn, s, moon, titan, as, it, crossed, the, nebula, and, found, that, titan, s, x, ray, shadow, was, larger, than, its, solid, surface, due, to, absorption, of, x, rays, in, its, atmosphere, these, observations, showed, that, the, thickness, of, titan, s, atmosphere, is, 880, km, 550, mi, the, transit, of, saturn, itself, could, not, be, observed, because, chandra, was, passing, through, the, van, allen, belts, at, the, time
