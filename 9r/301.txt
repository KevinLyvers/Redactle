a, chemical, equation, is, the, symbolic, representation, of, a, chemical, reaction, in, the, form, of, symbols, and, chemical, formulas, the, reactant, entities, are, given, on, the, left, hand, side, and, the, product, entities, are, on, the, right, hand, side, with, a, plus, sign, between, the, entities, in, both, the, reactants, and, the, products, and, an, arrow, that, points, towards, the, products, to, show, the, direction, of, the, reaction, the, chemical, formulas, may, be, symbolic, structural, pictorial, diagrams, or, intermixed, the, coefficients, next, to, the, symbols, and, formulas, of, entities, are, the, absolute, values, of, the, stoichiometric, numbers, the, first, chemical, equation, was, diagrammed, by, jean, beguin, in, 1615, a, chemical, equation, see, an, example, below, consists, of, a, list, of, reactants, the, starting, substances, on, the, left, hand, side, an, arrow, symbol, and, a, list, of, products, substances, formed, in, the, chemical, reaction, on, the, right, hand, side, each, substance, is, specified, by, its, chemical, formula, optionally, preceded, by, a, number, called, stoichiometric, coefficient, the, coefficient, specifies, how, many, entities, e, g, molecules, of, that, substance, are, involved, in, the, reaction, on, a, molecular, basis, if, not, written, explicitly, the, coefficient, is, equal, to, 1, multiple, substances, on, any, side, of, the, equation, are, separated, from, each, other, by, a, plus, sign, as, an, example, the, equation, for, the, reaction, of, hydrochloric, acid, with, sodium, can, be, denoted, given, the, formulas, are, fairly, simple, this, equation, could, be, read, as, two, h, c, l, plus, two, n, a, yields, two, n, a, c, l, and, h, two, alternately, and, in, general, for, equations, involving, complex, chemicals, the, chemical, formulas, are, read, using, iupac, nomenclature, which, could, verbalise, this, equation, as, two, hydrochloric, acid, molecules, and, two, sodium, atoms, react, to, form, two, formula, units, of, sodium, chloride, and, a, hydrogen, gas, molecule, different, variants, of, the, arrow, symbol, are, used, to, denote, the, type, of, a, reaction, to, indicate, physical, state, of, a, chemical, a, symbol, in, parentheses, may, be, appended, to, its, formula, s, for, a, solid, l, for, a, liquid, g, for, a, gas, and, aq, for, an, aqueous, solution, this, is, especially, done, when, one, wishes, to, emphasize, the, states, or, changes, thereof, for, example, the, reaction, of, aqueous, hydrochloric, acid, with, solid, metallic, sodium, to, form, aqueous, sodium, chloride, and, hydrogen, gas, would, be, written, like, this, that, reaction, would, have, different, thermodynamic, and, kinetic, properties, if, gaseous, hydrogen, chloride, were, to, replace, the, hydrochloric, acid, as, a, reactant, alternately, an, arrow, without, parentheses, is, used, in, some, cases, to, indicate, formation, of, a, gas, or, precipitate, this, is, especially, useful, if, only, one, such, species, is, formed, here, is, an, example, indicating, that, hydrogen, gas, is, formed, if, the, reaction, requires, energy, it, is, indicated, above, the, arrow, a, capital, greek, letter, delta, or, a, triangle, is, put, on, the, reaction, arrow, to, show, that, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, is, added, to, the, reaction, the, expression, h, is, used, as, a, symbol, for, the, addition, of, energy, in, the, form, of, light, other, symbols, are, used, for, other, specific, types, of, energy, or, radiation, similarly, if, a, reaction, requires, a, certain, medium, with, certain, specific, characteristics, then, the, name, of, the, acid, or, base, that, is, used, as, a, medium, may, be, placed, on, top, of, the, arrow, if, no, specific, acid, or, base, is, required, another, way, of, denoting, the, use, of, an, acidic, or, basic, medium, is, to, write, h, or, oh, or, even, acid, or, base, on, top, of, the, arrow, specific, conditions, of, the, temperature, and, pressure, as, well, as, the, presence, of, catalysts, may, be, indicated, in, the, same, way, the, standard, notation, for, chemical, equations, only, permits, all, reactants, on, one, side, all, products, on, the, other, and, all, stoichiometric, coefficients, positive, for, example, the, usual, form, of, the, equation, for, dehydration, of, methanol, to, dimethylether, is, sometimes, an, extension, is, used, where, some, substances, with, their, stoichiometric, coefficients, are, moved, above, or, below, the, arrow, preceded, by, a, plus, sign, or, nothing, for, a, reactant, and, by, a, minus, sign, for, a, product, then, the, same, equation, can, look, like, this, such, notation, serves, to, hide, less, important, substances, from, the, sides, of, the, equation, to, make, the, type, of, reaction, at, hand, more, obvious, and, to, facilitate, chaining, of, chemical, equations, this, is, very, useful, in, illustrating, multi, step, reaction, mechanisms, note, that, the, substances, above, or, below, the, arrows, are, not, catalysts, in, this, case, because, they, are, consumed, or, produced, in, the, reaction, like, ordinary, reactants, or, products, another, extension, used, in, reaction, mechanisms, moves, some, substances, to, branches, of, the, arrow, both, extensions, are, used, in, the, example, illustration, of, a, mechanism, use, of, negative, stoichiometric, coefficients, at, either, side, of, the, equation, like, in, the, example, below, is, not, widely, adopted, and, is, often, discouraged, because, no, nuclear, reactions, take, place, in, a, chemical, reaction, the, chemical, elements, pass, through, the, reaction, unchanged, thus, each, side, of, the, chemical, equation, must, represent, the, same, number, of, atoms, of, any, particular, element, or, nuclide, if, different, isotopes, are, taken, into, account, the, same, holds, for, the, total, electric, charge, as, stated, by, the, charge, conservation, law, an, equation, adhering, to, these, requirements, is, said, to, be, balanced, a, chemical, equation, is, balanced, by, assigning, suitable, values, to, the, stoichiometric, coefficients, simple, equations, can, be, balanced, by, inspection, that, is, by, trial, and, error, another, technique, involves, solving, a, system, of, linear, equations, balanced, equations, are, usually, written, with, smallest, natural, number, coefficients, yet, sometimes, it, may, be, advantageous, to, accept, a, fractional, coefficient, if, it, simplifies, the, other, coefficients, the, introductory, example, can, thus, be, rewritten, as, in, some, circumstances, the, fractional, coefficients, are, even, inevitable, for, example, the, reaction, corresponding, to, the, standard, enthalpy, of, formation, must, be, written, such, that, one, molecule, of, a, single, product, is, formed, this, will, often, require, that, some, reactant, coefficients, be, fractional, as, is, the, case, with, the, formation, of, lithium, fluoride, the, method, of, inspection, can, be, outlined, as, setting, the, most, complex, substance, s, stoichiometric, coefficient, to, 1, and, assigning, values, to, other, coefficients, step, by, step, such, that, both, sides, of, the, equation, end, up, with, the, same, number, of, atoms, for, each, element, if, any, fractional, coefficients, arise, during, this, process, the, presence, of, fractions, may, be, eliminated, at, any, time, by, multiplying, all, coefficients, by, their, lowest, common, denominator, balancing, of, the, chemical, equation, for, the, complete, combustion, of, methane, is, achieved, as, follows, for, each, chemical, element, or, nuclide, or, unchanged, moiety, or, charge, i, its, conservation, requirement, can, be, expressed, by, the, mathematical, equation, where, this, results, in, a, homogeneous, system, of, linear, equations, which, are, readily, solved, using, mathematical, methods, such, system, always, has, the, all, zeros, trivial, solution, which, we, are, not, interested, in, but, if, there, are, any, additional, solutions, there, will, be, infinite, number, of, them, any, non, trivial, solution, will, balance, the, chemical, equation, a, preferred, solution, is, one, with, whole, number, mostly, positive, stoichiometric, coefficients, s, j, with, greatest, common, divisor, equal, to, one, let, us, assign, variables, to, stoichiometric, coefficients, of, the, chemical, equation, from, the, previous, section, and, write, the, corresponding, linear, equations, c, s, 1, s, 3, h, 4, s, 1, 2, s, 4, o, 2, s, 2, 2, s, 3, s, 4, displaystyle, quad, begin, aligned, text, c, s, 1, s, 3, text, h, 4s, 1, 2s, 4, text, o, 2s, 2, 2s, 3, s, 4, end, aligned, all, solutions, to, this, system, of, linear, equations, are, of, the, following, form, where, r, is, any, real, number, the, choice, of, r, 1, yields, the, preferred, solution, which, corresponds, to, the, balanced, chemical, equation, the, system, of, linear, equations, introduced, in, the, previous, section, can, also, be, written, using, an, efficient, matrix, formalism, first, to, unify, the, reactant, and, product, stoichiometric, coefficients, s, j, let, us, introduce, the, quantity, called, stoichiometric, number, which, simplifies, the, linear, equations, to, where, j, is, the, total, number, of, reactant, and, product, substances, formulas, in, the, chemical, equation, placement, of, the, values, a, ij, at, row, i, and, column, j, of, the, composition, matrix, and, arrangement, of, the, stoichiometric, numbers, into, the, stoichiometric, vector, allows, the, system, of, equations, to, be, expressed, as, a, single, matrix, equation, like, previously, any, nonzero, stoichiometric, vector, which, solves, the, matrix, equation, will, balance, the, chemical, equation, the, set, of, solutions, to, the, matrix, equation, is, a, linear, space, called, the, kernel, of, the, matrix, a, for, this, space, to, contain, nonzero, vectors, i, e, to, have, a, positive, dimension, j, n, the, columns, of, the, composition, matrix, a, must, not, be, linearly, independent, the, problem, of, balancing, a, chemical, equation, then, becomes, the, problem, of, determining, the, j, n, dimensional, kernel, of, the, composition, matrix, it, is, important, to, note, that, only, for, j, n, 1, will, there, be, a, unique, preferred, solution, to, the, balancing, problem, for, j, n, 1, there, will, be, an, infinite, number, of, preferred, solutions, with, j, n, of, them, linearly, independent, if, j, n, 0, there, will, be, only, the, unusable, trivial, solution, the, zero, vector, techniques, have, been, developed, to, quickly, calculate, a, set, of, j, n, independent, solutions, to, the, balancing, problem, which, are, superior, to, the, inspection, and, algebraic, method, in, that, they, are, determinative, and, yield, all, solutions, to, the, balancing, problem, using, the, same, chemical, equation, again, write, the, corresponding, matrix, equation, its, solutions, are, of, the, following, form, where, r, is, any, real, number, the, choice, of, r, 1, and, a, sign, flip, of, the, first, two, rows, yields, the, preferred, solution, to, the, balancing, problem, an, ionic, equation, is, a, chemical, equation, in, which, electrolytes, are, written, as, dissociated, ions, ionic, equations, are, used, for, single, and, double, displacement, reactions, that, occur, in, aqueous, solutions, for, example, in, the, following, precipitation, reaction, the, full, ionic, equation, is, or, with, all, physical, states, included, in, this, reaction, the, ca, 2, and, the, no, 3, ions, remain, in, solution, and, are, not, part, of, the, reaction, that, is, these, ions, are, identical, on, both, the, reactant, and, product, side, of, the, chemical, equation, because, such, ions, do, not, participate, in, the, reaction, they, are, called, spectator, ions, a, net, ionic, equation, is, the, full, ionic, equation, from, which, the, spectator, ions, have, been, removed, the, net, ionic, equation, of, the, proceeding, reactions, is, or, in, reduced, balanced, form, in, a, neutralization, or, acid, base, reaction, the, net, ionic, equation, will, usually, be, there, are, a, few, acid, base, reactions, that, produce, a, precipitate, in, addition, to, the, water, molecule, shown, above, an, example, is, the, reaction, of, barium, hydroxide, with, phosphoric, acid, which, produces, not, only, water, but, also, the, insoluble, salt, barium, phosphate, in, this, reaction, there, are, no, spectator, ions, so, the, net, ionic, equation, is, the, same, as, the, full, ionic, equation, double, displacement, reactions, that, feature, a, carbonate, reacting, with, an, acid, have, the, net, ionic, equation, if, every, ion, is, a, spectator, ion, then, there, was, no, reaction, and, the, net, ionic, equation, is, null, generally, if, z, j, is, the, multiple, of, elementary, charge, on, the, j, th, molecule, charge, neutrality, may, be, written, as, where, the, j, are, the, stoichiometric, coefficients, described, above, the, z, j, may, be, incorporated, as, an, additional, row, in, the, a, ij, matrix, described, above, and, a, properly, balanced, ionic, equation, will, then, also, obey, now, mr, pfaundler, has, joined, these, two, phenomena, in, a, single, concept, by, considering, the, observed, limit, as, the, result, of, two, opposing, reactions, driving, the, one, in, the, example, cited, to, the, formation, of, sea, salt, and, nitric, acid, the, other, to, hydrochloric, acid, and, sodium, nitrate, this, consideration, which, experiment, validates, justifies, the, expression, chemical, equilibrium, which, is, used, to, characterize, the, final, state, of, limited, reactions, i, would, propose, to, translate, this, expression, by, the, following, symbol, i, thus, replace, in, this, case, the, sign, in, the, chemical, equation, by, the, sign, which, in, reality, doesn, t, express, just, equality, but, shows, also, the, direction, of, the, reaction, this, clearly, expresses, that, a, chemical, action, occurs, simultaneously, in, two, opposing, directions
