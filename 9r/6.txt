observation, in, the, natural, sciences, is, an, act, or, instance, of, noticing, or, perceiving, and, the, acquisition, of, information, from, a, primary, source, in, living, beings, observation, employs, the, senses, in, science, observation, can, also, involve, the, perception, and, recording, of, data, via, the, use, of, scientific, instruments, the, term, may, also, refer, to, any, data, collected, during, the, scientific, activity, observations, can, be, qualitative, that, is, the, absence, or, presence, of, a, property, is, noted, and, the, observed, phenomenon, described, or, quantitative, if, a, numerical, value, is, attached, to, the, observed, phenomenon, by, counting, or, measuring, the, scientific, method, requires, observations, of, natural, phenomena, to, formulate, and, test, hypotheses, it, consists, of, the, following, steps, observations, play, a, role, in, the, second, and, fifth, steps, of, the, scientific, method, however, the, need, for, reproducibility, requires, that, observations, by, different, observers, can, be, comparable, human, sense, impressions, are, subjective, and, qualitative, making, them, difficult, to, record, or, compare, the, use, of, measurement, was, developed, to, allow, recording, and, comparison, of, observations, made, at, different, times, and, places, by, different, people, the, measurement, consists, of, using, observation, to, compare, the, phenomenon, being, observed, to, a, standard, unit, the, standard, unit, can, be, an, artifact, process, or, definition, which, can, be, duplicated, or, shared, by, all, observers, in, measurement, the, number, of, standard, units, which, is, equal, to, the, observation, is, counted, measurement, reduces, an, observation, to, a, number, that, can, be, recorded, and, two, observations, which, result, in, the, same, number, are, equal, within, the, resolution, of, the, process, human, senses, are, limited, and, subject, to, errors, in, perception, such, as, optical, illusions, scientific, instruments, were, developed, to, aid, human, abilities, of, observation, such, as, weighing, scales, clocks, telescopes, microscopes, thermometers, cameras, and, tape, recorders, and, also, translate, into, perceptible, form, events, that, are, unobservable, by, the, senses, such, as, indicator, dyes, voltmeters, spectrometers, infrared, cameras, oscilloscopes, interferometers, geiger, counters, and, radio, receivers, one, problem, encountered, throughout, scientific, fields, is, that, the, observation, may, affect, the, process, being, observed, resulting, in, a, different, outcome, than, if, the, process, was, unobserved, this, is, called, the, observer, effect, for, example, it, is, not, normally, possible, to, check, the, air, pressure, in, an, automobile, tire, without, letting, out, some, of, the, air, thereby, changing, the, pressure, however, in, most, fields, of, science, it, is, possible, to, reduce, the, effects, of, observation, to, insignificance, by, using, better, instruments, considered, as, a, physical, process, itself, all, forms, of, observation, human, or, instrumental, involve, amplification, and, are, thus, thermodynamically, irreversible, processes, increasing, entropy, in, some, specific, fields, of, science, the, results, of, observation, differ, depending, on, factors, that, are, not, important, in, everyday, observation, these, are, usually, illustrated, with, apparent, paradoxes, in, which, an, event, appears, different, when, observed, from, two, different, points, of, view, seeming, to, violate, common, sense, the, human, senses, do, not, function, like, a, video, camcorder, impartially, recording, all, observations, human, perception, occurs, by, a, complex, unconscious, process, of, abstraction, in, which, certain, details, of, the, incoming, sense, data, are, noticed, and, remembered, and, the, rest, is, forgotten, what, is, kept, and, what, is, thrown, away, depends, on, an, internal, model, or, representation, of, the, world, called, by, psychologists, a, schema, that, is, built, up, over, our, entire, lives, the, data, is, fitted, into, this, schema, later, when, events, are, remembered, memory, gaps, may, even, be, filled, by, plausible, data, the, mind, makes, up, to, fit, the, model, this, is, called, reconstructive, memory, how, much, attention, the, various, perceived, data, are, given, depends, on, an, internal, value, system, which, judges, how, important, it, is, to, the, individual, thus, two, people, can, view, the, same, event, and, come, away, with, entirely, different, perceptions, of, it, even, disagreeing, about, simple, facts, this, is, why, eyewitness, testimony, is, notoriously, unreliable, several, of, the, more, important, ways, observations, can, be, affected, by, human, psychology, are, given, below, human, observations, are, biased, toward, confirming, the, observer, s, conscious, and, unconscious, expectations, and, view, of, the, world, we, see, what, we, expect, to, see, in, psychology, this, is, called, confirmation, bias, since, the, object, of, scientific, research, is, the, discovery, of, new, phenomena, this, bias, can, and, has, caused, new, discoveries, to, be, overlooked, one, example, is, the, discovery, of, x, rays, it, can, also, result, in, erroneous, scientific, support, for, widely, held, cultural, myths, on, the, other, hand, as, in, the, scientific, racism, that, supported, ideas, of, racial, superiority, in, the, early, 20th, century, correct, scientific, technique, emphasizes, careful, recording, of, observations, separating, experimental, observations, from, the, conclusions, drawn, from, them, and, techniques, such, as, blind, or, double, blind, experiments, to, minimize, observational, bias, modern, scientific, instruments, can, extensively, process, observations, before, they, are, presented, to, the, human, senses, and, particularly, with, computerized, instruments, there, is, sometimes, a, question, as, to, where, in, the, data, processing, chain, observing, ends, and, drawing, conclusions, begins, this, has, recently, become, an, issue, with, digitally, enhanced, images, published, as, experimental, data, in, papers, in, scientific, journals, the, images, are, enhanced, to, bring, out, features, that, the, researcher, wants, to, emphasize, but, this, also, has, the, effect, of, supporting, the, researcher, s, conclusions, this, is, a, form, of, bias, that, is, difficult, to, quantify, some, scientific, journals, have, begun, to, set, detailed, standards, for, what, types, of, image, processing, are, allowed, in, research, results, computerized, instruments, often, keep, a, copy, of, the, raw, data, from, sensors, before, processing, which, is, the, ultimate, defense, against, processing, bias, and, similarly, scientific, standards, require, preservation, of, the, original, unenhanced, raw, versions, of, images, used, as, research, data, in, cosmology, the, origins, of, observation, are, related, with, the, origins, of, evolutions, in, our, cosmos, process, philosophy, is, the, changing, relationships, of, our, senses, minds, and, experiences, to, ourselves, observe, always, that, everything, is, the, result, of, a, change, and, get, used, to, thinking, that, there, is, nothing, nature, loves, so, well, as, to, change, existing, forms, and, to, make, new, ones, like, them
