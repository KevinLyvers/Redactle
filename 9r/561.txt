a, stratigraphic, unit, is, a, volume, of, rock, of, identifiable, origin, and, relative, age, range, that, is, defined, by, the, distinctive, and, dominant, easily, mapped, and, recognizable, petrographic, lithologic, or, paleontologic, features, facies, that, characterize, it, units, must, be, mappable, and, distinct, from, one, another, but, the, contact, need, not, be, particularly, distinct, for, instance, a, unit, may, be, defined, by, terms, such, as, when, the, sandstone, component, exceeds, 75, sequences, of, sedimentary, and, volcanic, rocks, are, subdivided, on, the, basis, of, their, shared, or, associated, lithology, formally, identified, lithostratigraphic, units, are, structured, in, a, hierarchy, of, lithostratigraphic, rank, higher, rank, units, generally, comprising, two, or, more, units, of, lower, rank, going, from, smaller, to, larger, in, rank, the, main, lithostratigraphic, ranks, are, bed, member, formation, group, and, supergroup, formal, names, of, lithostratigraphic, units, are, assigned, by, geological, surveys, units, of, formation, or, higher, rank, are, usually, named, for, the, unit, s, type, location, and, the, formal, name, usually, also, states, the, unit, s, rank, or, lithology, a, lithostratigraphic, unit, may, have, a, change, in, rank, over, a, some, distance, a, group, may, thin, to, a, formation, in, another, region, and, a, formation, may, reduce, in, rank, for, member, or, bed, as, it, pinches, out, a, bed, is, a, lithologically, distinct, layer, within, a, member, or, formation, and, is, the, smallest, recognisable, stratigraphic, unit, these, are, not, normally, named, but, may, be, in, the, case, of, a, marker, horizon, a, member, is, a, named, lithologically, distinct, part, of, a, formation, not, all, formations, are, subdivided, in, this, way, and, even, where, they, are, recognized, they, may, only, form, part, of, the, formation, a, member, need, not, be, mappable, at, the, same, scale, as, a, formation, formations, are, the, primary, units, used, in, the, subdivision, of, a, sequence, and, may, vary, in, scale, from, tens, of, centimetres, to, kilometres, they, should, be, distinct, lithologically, from, other, formations, although, the, boundaries, do, not, need, to, be, sharp, to, be, formally, recognised, a, formation, must, have, sufficient, extent, to, be, useful, in, mapping, an, area, a, group, is, a, set, of, two, or, more, formations, that, share, certain, lithological, characteristics, a, group, may, be, made, up, of, different, formations, in, different, geographical, areas, and, individual, formations, may, appear, in, more, than, one, group, groups, are, occasionally, divided, into, subgroups, but, subgroups, are, not, mentioned, in, the, north, american, stratigraphic, code, and, are, permitted, under, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, guidelines, only, in, exceptional, circumstances, a, supergroup, is, a, set, of, two, or, more, associated, groups, and, or, formations, that, share, certain, lithological, characteristics, a, supergroup, may, be, made, up, of, different, groups, in, different, geographical, areas, a, sequence, of, fossil, bearing, sedimentary, rocks, can, be, subdivided, on, the, basis, of, the, occurrence, of, particular, fossil, taxa, a, unit, defined, in, this, way, is, known, as, a, biostratigraphic, unit, generally, shortened, to, biozone, the, five, commonly, used, types, of, biozone, are, assemblage, range, abundance, interval, and, lineage, zones
