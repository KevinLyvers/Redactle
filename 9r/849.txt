the, focal, length, of, an, optical, system, is, a, measure, of, how, strongly, the, system, converges, or, diverges, light, it, is, the, inverse, of, the, system, s, optical, power, a, positive, focal, length, indicates, that, a, system, converges, light, while, a, negative, focal, length, indicates, that, the, system, diverges, light, a, system, with, a, shorter, focal, length, bends, the, rays, more, sharply, bringing, them, to, a, focus, in, a, shorter, distance, or, diverging, them, more, quickly, for, the, special, case, of, a, thin, lens, in, air, a, positive, focal, length, is, the, distance, over, which, initially, collimated, parallel, rays, are, brought, to, a, focus, or, alternatively, a, negative, focal, length, indicates, how, far, in, front, of, the, lens, a, point, source, must, be, located, to, form, a, collimated, beam, for, more, general, optical, systems, the, focal, length, has, no, intuitive, meaning, it, is, simply, the, inverse, of, the, system, s, optical, power, in, most, photography, and, all, telescopy, where, the, subject, is, essentially, infinitely, far, away, longer, focal, length, lower, optical, power, leads, to, higher, magnification, and, a, narrower, angle, of, view, conversely, shorter, focal, length, or, higher, optical, power, is, associated, with, lower, magnification, and, a, wider, angle, of, view, on, the, other, hand, in, applications, such, as, microscopy, in, which, magnification, is, achieved, by, bringing, the, object, close, to, the, lens, a, shorter, focal, length, higher, optical, power, leads, to, higher, magnification, because, the, subject, can, be, brought, closer, to, the, center, of, projection, for, a, thin, lens, in, air, the, focal, length, is, the, distance, from, the, center, of, the, lens, to, the, principal, foci, or, focal, points, of, the, lens, for, a, converging, lens, for, example, a, convex, lens, the, focal, length, is, positive, and, is, the, distance, at, which, a, beam, of, collimated, light, will, be, focused, to, a, single, spot, for, a, diverging, lens, for, example, a, concave, lens, the, focal, length, is, negative, and, is, the, distance, to, the, point, from, which, a, collimated, beam, appears, to, be, diverging, after, passing, through, the, lens, when, a, lens, is, used, to, form, an, image, of, some, object, the, distance, from, the, object, to, the, lens, u, the, distance, from, the, lens, to, the, image, v, and, the, focal, length, f, are, related, by, the, focal, length, of, a, thin, convex, lens, can, be, easily, measured, by, using, it, to, form, an, image, of, a, distant, light, source, on, a, screen, the, lens, is, moved, until, a, sharp, image, is, formed, on, the, screen, in, this, case, 1, u, is, negligible, and, the, focal, length, is, then, given, by, determining, the, focal, length, of, a, concave, lens, is, somewhat, more, difficult, the, focal, length, of, such, a, lens, is, defined, as, the, point, at, which, the, spreading, beams, of, light, meet, when, they, are, extended, backwards, no, image, is, formed, during, such, a, test, and, the, focal, length, must, be, determined, by, passing, light, for, example, the, light, of, a, laser, beam, through, the, lens, examining, how, much, that, light, becomes, dispersed, bent, and, following, the, beam, of, light, backwards, to, the, lens, s, focal, point, for, a, thick, lens, one, which, has, a, non, negligible, thickness, or, an, imaging, system, consisting, of, several, lenses, or, mirrors, e, g, a, photographic, lens, or, a, telescope, there, are, several, related, concepts, that, are, referred, to, as, focal, lengths, for, an, optical, system, in, air, the, effective, focal, length, front, focal, length, and, rear, focal, length, are, all, the, same, and, may, be, called, simply, focal, length, for, an, optical, system, in, a, medium, other, than, air, or, vacuum, the, front, and, rear, focal, lengths, are, equal, to, the, efl, times, the, refractive, index, of, the, medium, in, front, of, or, behind, the, lens, n, 1, and, n, 2, in, the, diagram, above, the, term, focal, length, by, itself, is, ambiguous, in, this, case, the, historical, usage, was, to, define, the, focal, length, as, the, efl, times, the, index, of, refraction, of, the, medium, for, a, system, with, different, media, on, both, sides, such, as, the, human, eye, the, front, and, rear, focal, lengths, are, not, equal, to, one, another, and, convention, may, dictate, which, one, is, called, the, focal, length, of, the, system, some, modern, authors, avoid, this, ambiguity, by, instead, defining, focal, length, to, be, a, synonym, for, efl, the, distinction, between, front, rear, focal, length, and, efl, is, important, for, studying, the, human, eye, the, eye, can, be, represented, by, an, equivalent, thin, lens, at, an, air, fluid, boundary, with, front, and, rear, focal, lengths, equal, to, those, of, the, eye, or, it, can, be, represented, by, a, different, equivalent, thin, lens, that, is, totally, in, air, with, focal, length, equal, to, the, eye, s, efl, for, the, case, of, a, lens, of, thickness, d, in, air, n, 1, n, 2, 1, and, surfaces, with, radii, of, curvature, r, 1, and, r, 2, the, effective, focal, length, f, is, given, by, the, lensmaker, s, equation, 1, f, n, 1, 1, r, 1, 1, r, 2, n, 1, d, n, r, 1, r, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, n, 1, left, frac, 1, r, 1, frac, 1, r, 2, frac, n, 1, d, nr, 1, r, 2, right, where, n, is, the, refractive, index, of, the, lens, medium, the, quantity, 1, f, is, also, known, as, the, optical, power, of, the, lens, the, corresponding, front, focal, distance, is, ffd, f, 1, n, 1, d, n, r, 2, displaystyle, mbox, ffd, f, left, 1, frac, n, 1, d, nr, 2, right, and, the, back, focal, distance, bfd, f, 1, n, 1, d, n, r, 1, displaystyle, mbox, bfd, f, left, 1, frac, n, 1, d, nr, 1, right, in, the, sign, convention, used, here, the, value, of, r, 1, will, be, positive, if, the, first, lens, surface, is, convex, and, negative, if, it, is, concave, the, value, of, r, 2, is, negative, if, the, second, surface, is, convex, and, positive, if, concave, sign, conventions, vary, between, different, authors, which, results, in, different, forms, of, these, equations, depending, on, the, convention, used, for, a, spherically, curved, mirror, in, air, the, magnitude, of, the, focal, length, is, equal, to, the, radius, of, curvature, of, the, mirror, divided, by, two, the, focal, length, is, positive, for, a, concave, mirror, and, negative, for, a, convex, mirror, in, the, sign, convention, used, in, optical, design, a, concave, mirror, has, negative, radius, of, curvature, so, f, r, 2, displaystyle, f, r, over, 2, where, r, is, the, radius, of, curvature, of, the, mirror, s, surface, see, radius, of, curvature, optics, for, more, information, on, the, sign, convention, for, radius, of, curvature, used, here, camera, lens, focal, lengths, are, usually, specified, in, millimetres, mm, but, some, older, lenses, are, marked, in, centimetres, cm, or, inches, focal, length, f, and, field, of, view, fov, of, a, lens, are, inversely, proportional, for, a, standard, rectilinear, lens, f, o, v, 2, arctan, x, 2, f, textstyle, mathrm, fov, 2, arctan, left, x, over, 2f, right, where, x, is, the, width, of, the, film, or, imaging, sensor, when, a, photographic, lens, is, set, to, infinity, its, rear, principal, plane, is, separated, from, the, sensor, or, film, which, is, then, situated, at, the, focal, plane, by, the, lens, s, focal, length, objects, far, away, from, the, camera, then, produce, sharp, images, on, the, sensor, or, film, which, is, also, at, the, image, plane, to, render, closer, objects, in, sharp, focus, the, lens, must, be, adjusted, to, increase, the, distance, between, the, rear, principal, plane, and, the, film, to, put, the, film, at, the, image, plane, the, focal, length, f, the, distance, from, the, front, principal, plane, to, the, object, to, photograph, s, 1, and, the, distance, from, the, rear, principal, plane, to, the, image, plane, s, 2, are, then, related, by, 1, s, 1, 1, s, 2, 1, f, displaystyle, frac, 1, s, 1, frac, 1, s, 2, frac, 1, f, as, s, 1, is, decreased, s, 2, must, be, increased, for, example, consider, a, normal, lens, for, a, 35, mm, camera, with, a, focal, length, of, f, 50, mm, to, focus, a, distant, object, s, 1, the, rear, principal, plane, of, the, lens, must, be, located, a, distance, s, 2, 50, mm, from, the, film, plane, so, that, it, is, at, the, location, of, the, image, plane, to, focus, an, object, 1, m, away, s, 1, 1, 000, mm, the, lens, must, be, moved, 2, 6, mm, farther, away, from, the, film, plane, to, s, 2, 52, 6, mm, the, focal, length, of, a, lens, determines, the, magnification, at, which, it, images, distant, objects, it, is, equal, to, the, distance, between, the, image, plane, and, a, pinhole, that, images, distant, objects, the, same, size, as, the, lens, in, question, for, rectilinear, lenses, that, is, with, no, image, distortion, the, imaging, of, distant, objects, is, well, modelled, as, a, pinhole, camera, model, this, model, leads, to, the, simple, geometric, model, that, photographers, use, for, computing, the, angle, of, view, of, a, camera, in, this, case, the, angle, of, view, depends, only, on, the, ratio, of, focal, length, to, film, size, in, general, the, angle, of, view, depends, also, on, the, distortion, a, lens, with, a, focal, length, about, equal, to, the, diagonal, size, of, the, film, or, sensor, format, is, known, as, a, normal, lens, its, angle, of, view, is, similar, to, the, angle, subtended, by, a, large, enough, print, viewed, at, a, typical, viewing, distance, of, the, print, diagonal, which, therefore, yields, a, normal, perspective, when, viewing, the, print, this, angle, of, view, is, about, 53, degrees, diagonally, for, full, frame, 35, mm, format, cameras, the, diagonal, is, 43, mm, and, a, typical, normal, lens, has, a, 50, mm, focal, length, a, lens, with, a, focal, length, shorter, than, normal, is, often, referred, to, as, a, wide, angle, lens, typically, 35, mm, and, less, for, 35, mm, format, cameras, while, a, lens, significantly, longer, than, normal, may, be, referred, to, as, a, telephoto, lens, typically, 85, mm, and, more, for, 35, mm, format, cameras, technically, long, focal, length, lenses, are, only, telephoto, if, the, focal, length, is, longer, than, the, physical, length, of, the, lens, but, the, term, is, often, used, to, describe, any, long, focal, length, lens, due, to, the, popularity, of, the, 35, mm, standard, camera, lens, combinations, are, often, described, in, terms, of, their, 35, mm, equivalent, focal, length, that, is, the, focal, length, of, a, lens, that, would, have, the, same, angle, of, view, or, field, of, view, if, used, on, a, full, frame, 35, mm, camera, use, of, a, 35, mm, equivalent, focal, length, is, particularly, common, with, digital, cameras, which, often, use, sensors, smaller, than, 35, mm, film, and, so, require, correspondingly, shorter, focal, lengths, to, achieve, a, given, angle, of, view, by, a, factor, known, as, the, crop, factor, the, optical, power, of, a, lens, or, curved, mirror, is, a, physical, quantity, equal, to, the, reciprocal, of, the, focal, length, expressed, in, metres, a, dioptre, is, its, unit, of, measurement, with, dimension, of, reciprocal, length, equivalent, to, one, reciprocal, metre, 1, dioptre, 1, m, 1, for, example, a, 2, dioptre, lens, brings, parallel, rays, of, light, to, focus, at, 1, 2, metre, a, flat, window, has, an, optical, power, of, zero, dioptres, as, it, does, not, cause, light, to, converge, or, diverge, the, main, benefit, of, using, optical, power, rather, than, focal, length, is, that, the, thin, lens, formula, has, the, object, distance, image, distance, and, focal, length, all, as, reciprocals, additionally, when, relatively, thin, lenses, are, placed, close, together, their, powers, approximately, add, thus, a, thin, 2, 0, dioptre, lens, placed, close, to, a, thin, 0, 5, dioptre, lens, yields, almost, the, same, focal, length, as, a, single, 2, 5, dioptre, lens
