a, barred, spiral, galaxy, is, a, spiral, galaxy, with, a, central, bar, shaped, structure, composed, of, stars, bars, are, found, in, about, two, thirds, of, all, spiral, galaxies, in, the, local, universe, and, generally, affect, both, the, motions, of, stars, and, interstellar, gas, within, spiral, galaxies, and, can, affect, spiral, arms, as, well, the, milky, way, galaxy, where, the, solar, system, is, located, is, classified, as, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, edwin, hubble, classified, spiral, galaxies, of, this, type, as, sb, spiral, barred, in, his, hubble, sequence, and, arranged, them, into, sub, categories, based, on, how, open, the, arms, of, the, spiral, are, sba, types, feature, tightly, bound, arms, while, sbc, types, are, at, the, other, extreme, and, have, loosely, bound, arms, sbb, type, galaxies, lie, in, between, the, two, sb0, is, a, barred, lenticular, galaxy, a, new, type, sbm, was, subsequently, created, to, describe, somewhat, irregular, barred, spirals, such, as, the, magellanic, clouds, which, were, once, classified, as, irregular, galaxies, but, have, since, been, found, to, contain, barred, spiral, structures, among, other, types, in, hubble, s, classifications, for, the, galaxies, are, the, spiral, galaxy, elliptical, galaxy, and, irregular, galaxy, although, theoretical, models, of, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, had, not, previously, expected, galaxies, becoming, stable, enough, to, host, bars, very, early, in, the, universe, s, history, evidence, has, recently, emerged, of, the, existence, of, numerous, spiral, galaxies, in, the, early, universe, barred, galaxies, are, apparently, predominant, with, surveys, showing, that, up, to, two, thirds, of, all, spiral, galaxies, develop, a, bar, the, creation, of, the, bar, is, generally, thought, to, be, the, result, of, a, density, wave, radiating, from, the, center, of, the, galaxy, whose, effects, reshape, the, orbits, of, the, inner, stars, this, effect, builds, over, time, to, stars, orbiting, farther, out, which, creates, a, self, perpetuating, bar, structure, the, bar, structure, is, believed, to, act, as, a, type, of, stellar, nursery, channeling, gas, inwards, from, the, spiral, arms, through, orbital, resonance, fueling, star, birth, in, the, vicinity, of, its, center, this, process, is, also, thought, to, explain, why, many, barred, spiral, galaxies, have, active, galactic, nuclei, such, as, that, seen, in, the, southern, pinwheel, galaxy, bars, are, thought, to, be, temporary, phenomena, in, the, lives, of, spiral, galaxies, the, bar, structures, decay, over, time, transforming, galaxies, from, barred, spirals, to, more, regular, spiral, patterns, past, a, certain, size, the, accumulated, mass, of, the, bar, compromises, the, stability, of, the, overall, bar, structure, simulations, show, that, many, bars, likely, experience, a, buckling, event, in, which, a, disturbance, in, the, orbital, resonances, of, stars, in, the, bar, structure, leads, to, an, inward, collapse, in, which, the, bar, becomes, thicker, and, shorter, though, the, exact, mechanism, behind, this, buckling, instability, remains, hotly, debated, barred, spiral, galaxies, with, high, mass, accumulated, in, their, center, thus, tend, to, have, short, stubby, bars, such, buckling, phenomena, are, significantly, suppressed, and, delayed, by, the, presence, of, a, supermassive, black, hole, in, the, galactic, center, but, occur, nonetheless, since, so, many, spiral, galaxies, have, bar, structures, it, is, likely, that, they, are, recurring, phenomena, in, spiral, galaxy, development, the, oscillating, evolutionary, cycle, from, spiral, galaxy, to, barred, spiral, galaxy, is, thought, to, take, on, average, about, two, billion, years, recent, studies, have, confirmed, the, idea, that, bars, are, a, sign, of, galaxies, reaching, full, maturity, as, the, formative, years, end, a, 2008, investigation, found, that, only, 20, percent, of, the, spiral, galaxies, in, the, distant, past, possessed, bars, compared, with, about, 65, percent, of, their, local, counterparts, the, general, classification, is, sb, spiral, barred, the, sub, categories, are, based, on, how, open, or, tight, the, arms, of, the, spiral, are, sba, types, feature, tightly, bound, arms, sbc, types, are, at, the, other, extreme, and, have, loosely, bound, arms, sbb, galaxies, lie, in, between, sbm, describes, somewhat, irregular, barred, spirals, sb0, is, a, barred, lenticular, galaxy, of, barred, magellanic, spiral
