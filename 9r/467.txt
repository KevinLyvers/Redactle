potassium, hydroxide, is, an, inorganic, compound, with, the, formula, k, oh, and, is, commonly, called, caustic, potash, along, with, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, koh, is, a, prototypical, strong, base, it, has, many, industrial, and, niche, applications, most, of, which, utilize, its, caustic, nature, and, its, reactivity, toward, acids, an, estimated, 700, 000, to, 800, 000, tonnes, were, produced, in, 2005, koh, is, noteworthy, as, the, precursor, to, most, soft, and, liquid, soaps, as, well, as, numerous, potassium, containing, chemicals, it, is, a, white, solid, that, is, dangerously, corrosive, koh, exhibits, high, thermal, stability, because, of, this, high, stability, and, relatively, low, melting, point, it, is, often, melt, cast, as, pellets, or, rods, forms, that, have, low, surface, area, and, convenient, handling, properties, these, pellets, become, tacky, in, air, because, koh, is, hygroscopic, most, commercial, samples, are, ca, 90, pure, the, remainder, being, water, and, carbonates, its, dissolution, in, water, is, strongly, exothermic, concentrated, aqueous, solutions, are, sometimes, called, potassium, lyes, even, at, high, temperatures, solid, koh, does, not, dehydrate, readily, at, higher, temperatures, solid, koh, crystallizes, in, the, nacl, crystal, structure, the, oh, group, is, either, rapidly, or, randomly, disordered, so, that, it, is, effectively, a, spherical, anion, of, radius, 1, 53, between, cl, and, f, in, size, at, room, temperature, the, oh, groups, are, ordered, and, the, environment, about, the, k, centers, is, distorted, with, k, oh, distances, ranging, from, 2, 69, to, 3, 15, depending, on, the, orientation, of, the, oh, group, koh, forms, a, series, of, crystalline, hydrates, namely, the, monohydrate, koh, h, 2, o, the, dihydrate, koh, 2, h, 2, o, and, the, tetrahydrate, koh, 4, h, 2, o, about, 112, g, of, koh, dissolve, in, 100, ml, water, at, room, temperature, which, contrasts, with, 100, g, 100, ml, for, naoh, thus, on, a, molar, basis, koh, is, slightly, more, soluble, than, naoh, lower, molecular, weight, alcohols, such, as, methanol, ethanol, and, propanols, are, also, excellent, solvents, they, participate, in, an, acid, base, equilibrium, in, the, case, of, methanol, the, potassium, methoxide, methylate, forms, because, of, its, high, affinity, for, water, koh, serves, as, a, desiccant, in, the, laboratory, it, is, often, used, to, dry, basic, solvents, especially, amines, and, pyridines, koh, like, naoh, serves, as, a, source, of, oh, a, highly, nucleophilic, anion, that, attacks, polar, bonds, in, both, inorganic, and, organic, materials, aqueous, koh, saponifies, esters, when, r, is, a, long, chain, the, product, is, called, a, potassium, soap, this, reaction, is, manifested, by, the, greasy, feel, that, koh, gives, when, touched, fats, on, the, skin, are, rapidly, converted, to, soap, and, glycerol, molten, koh, is, used, to, displace, halides, and, other, leaving, groups, the, reaction, is, especially, useful, for, aromatic, reagents, to, give, the, corresponding, phenols, complementary, to, its, reactivity, toward, acids, koh, attacks, oxides, thus, sio, 2, is, attacked, by, koh, to, give, soluble, potassium, silicates, koh, reacts, with, carbon, dioxide, to, give, potassium, bicarbonate, historically, koh, was, made, by, adding, potassium, carbonate, to, a, strong, solution, of, calcium, hydroxide, slaked, lime, the, salt, metathesis, reaction, results, in, precipitation, of, solid, calcium, carbonate, leaving, potassium, hydroxide, in, solution, filtering, off, the, precipitated, calcium, carbonate, and, boiling, down, the, solution, gives, potassium, hydroxide, calcinated, or, caustic, potash, this, method, of, producing, potassium, hydroxide, remained, dominant, until, the, late, 19th, century, when, it, was, largely, replaced, by, the, current, method, of, electrolysis, of, potassium, chloride, solutions, the, method, is, analogous, to, the, manufacture, of, sodium, hydroxide, see, chloralkali, process, hydrogen, gas, forms, as, a, byproduct, on, the, cathode, concurrently, an, anodic, oxidation, of, the, chloride, ion, takes, place, forming, chlorine, gas, as, a, byproduct, separation, of, the, anodic, and, cathodic, spaces, in, the, electrolysis, cell, is, essential, for, this, process, koh, and, naoh, can, be, used, interchangeably, for, a, number, of, applications, although, in, industry, naoh, is, preferred, because, of, its, lower, cost, in, industry, koh, is, a, good, catalyst, for, hydrothermal, gasification, process, in, this, process, it, is, used, to, improve, the, yield, of, gas, and, amount, of, hydrogen, in, process, for, example, production, of, coke, fuel, from, coal, often, produces, much, coking, wastewater, in, order, to, degrade, it, supercritical, water, is, used, to, convert, it, to, the, syngas, containing, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, hydrogen, and, methane, using, pressure, swing, adsorption, we, could, separate, various, gases, and, then, use, power, to, gas, technology, to, convert, them, to, fuel, on, the, other, hand, the, hydrothermal, gasification, process, could, degrade, other, waste, such, as, sewage, sludge, and, waste, from, food, factories, many, potassium, salts, are, prepared, by, neutralization, reactions, involving, koh, the, potassium, salts, of, carbonate, cyanide, permanganate, phosphate, and, various, silicates, are, prepared, by, treating, either, the, oxides, or, the, acids, with, koh, the, high, solubility, of, potassium, phosphate, is, desirable, in, fertilizers, the, saponification, of, fats, with, koh, is, used, to, prepare, the, corresponding, potassium, soaps, which, are, softer, than, the, more, common, sodium, hydroxide, derived, soaps, because, of, their, softness, and, greater, solubility, potassium, soaps, require, less, water, to, liquefy, and, can, thus, contain, more, cleaning, agent, than, liquefied, sodium, soaps, aqueous, potassium, hydroxide, is, employed, as, the, electrolyte, in, alkaline, batteries, based, on, nickel, cadmium, nickel, hydrogen, and, manganese, dioxide, zinc, potassium, hydroxide, is, preferred, over, sodium, hydroxide, because, its, solutions, are, more, conductive, the, nickel, metal, hydride, batteries, in, the, toyota, prius, use, a, mixture, of, potassium, hydroxide, and, sodium, hydroxide, nickel, iron, batteries, also, use, potassium, hydroxide, electrolyte, in, food, products, potassium, hydroxide, acts, as, a, food, thickener, ph, control, agent, and, food, stabilizer, the, fda, considers, it, generally, safe, as, a, direct, food, ingredient, when, used, in, accordance, with, good, manufacturing, practices, it, is, known, in, the, e, number, system, as, e525, like, sodium, hydroxide, potassium, hydroxide, attracts, numerous, specialized, applications, virtually, all, of, which, rely, on, its, properties, as, a, strong, chemical, base, with, its, consequent, ability, to, degrade, many, materials, for, example, in, a, process, commonly, referred, to, as, chemical, cremation, or, resomation, potassium, hydroxide, hastens, the, decomposition, of, soft, tissues, both, animal, and, human, to, leave, behind, only, the, bones, and, other, hard, tissues, entomologists, wishing, to, study, the, fine, structure, of, insect, anatomy, may, use, a, 10, aqueous, solution, of, koh, to, apply, this, process, in, chemical, synthesis, the, choice, between, the, use, of, koh, and, the, use, of, naoh, is, guided, by, the, solubility, or, keeping, quality, of, the, resulting, salt, the, corrosive, properties, of, potassium, hydroxide, make, it, a, useful, ingredient, in, agents, and, preparations, that, clean, and, disinfect, surfaces, and, materials, that, can, themselves, resist, corrosion, by, koh, koh, is, also, used, for, semiconductor, chip, fabrication, for, example, anisotropic, wet, etching, potassium, hydroxide, is, often, the, main, active, ingredient, in, chemical, cuticle, removers, used, in, manicure, treatments, because, aggressive, bases, like, koh, damage, the, cuticle, of, the, hair, shaft, potassium, hydroxide, is, used, to, chemically, assist, the, removal, of, hair, from, animal, hides, the, hides, are, soaked, for, several, hours, in, a, solution, of, koh, and, water, to, prepare, them, for, the, unhairing, stage, of, the, tanning, process, this, same, effect, is, also, used, to, weaken, human, hair, in, preparation, for, shaving, preshave, products, and, some, shave, creams, contain, potassium, hydroxide, to, force, open, the, hair, cuticle, and, to, act, as, a, hygroscopic, agent, to, attract, and, force, water, into, the, hair, shaft, causing, further, damage, to, the, hair, in, this, weakened, state, the, hair, is, more, easily, cut, by, a, razor, blade, potassium, hydroxide, is, used, to, identify, some, species, of, fungi, a, 3, 5, aqueous, solution, of, koh, is, applied, to, the, flesh, of, a, mushroom, and, the, researcher, notes, whether, or, not, the, color, of, the, flesh, changes, certain, species, of, gilled, mushrooms, boletes, polypores, and, lichens, are, identifiable, based, on, this, color, change, reaction, potassium, hydroxide, and, its, solutions, are, severe, irritants, to, skin, and, other, tissue
