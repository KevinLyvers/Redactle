a, river, delta, is, a, landform, shaped, like, a, triangle, created, by, the, deposition, of, sediment, that, is, carried, by, a, river, and, enters, slower, moving, or, stagnant, water, this, occurs, at, a, river, mouth, when, it, enters, an, ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or, more, rarely, another, river, that, cannot, carry, away, the, supplied, sediment, it, is, so, named, because, its, triangle, shape, resembles, the, uppercase, greek, letter, delta, the, size, and, shape, of, a, delta, are, controlled, by, the, balance, between, watershed, processes, that, supply, sediment, and, receiving, basin, processes, that, redistribute, sequester, and, export, that, sediment, the, size, geometry, and, location, of, the, receiving, basin, also, plays, an, important, role, in, delta, evolution, river, deltas, are, important, in, human, civilization, as, they, are, major, agricultural, production, centers, and, population, centers, they, can, provide, coastline, defence, and, can, impact, drinking, water, supply, they, are, also, ecologically, important, with, different, species, assemblages, depending, on, their, landscape, position, on, geologic, timescales, they, are, also, important, carbon, sinks, a, river, delta, is, so, named, because, the, shape, of, the, nile, delta, approximates, the, triangular, uppercase, greek, letter, delta, the, triangular, shape, of, the, nile, delta, was, known, to, audiences, of, classical, athenian, drama, the, tragedy, prometheus, bound, by, aeschylus, refers, to, it, as, the, triangular, nilotic, land, though, not, as, a, delta, herodotus, s, description, of, egypt, in, his, histories, mentions, the, delta, fourteen, times, as, the, delta, as, it, is, called, by, the, ionians, including, describing, the, outflow, of, silt, into, the, sea, and, the, convexly, curved, seaward, side, of, the, triangle, despite, making, comparisons, to, other, river, systems, deltas, herodotus, did, not, describe, them, as, deltas, the, greek, historian, polybius, likened, the, land, between, the, rh, ne, and, is, re, rivers, to, the, nile, delta, referring, to, both, as, islands, but, did, not, apply, the, word, delta, according, to, the, greek, geographer, strabo, the, cynic, philosopher, onesicritus, of, astypalaea, who, accompanied, alexander, the, great, s, conquests, in, india, reported, that, patalene, the, delta, of, the, indus, river, was, a, delta, koin, greek, romanized, kalei, de, t, n, n, son, d, lta, lit, he, calls, the, island, a, delta, the, roman, author, arrian, s, indica, states, that, the, delta, of, the, land, of, the, indians, is, made, by, the, indus, river, no, less, than, is, the, case, with, that, of, egypt, as, a, generic, term, for, the, landform, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, the, word, delta, is, first, attested, in, the, english, speaking, world, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, the, work, of, edward, gibbon, river, deltas, form, when, a, river, carrying, sediment, reaches, a, body, of, water, such, as, a, lake, ocean, or, a, reservoir, when, the, flow, enters, the, standing, water, it, is, no, longer, confined, to, its, channel, and, expands, in, width, this, flow, expansion, results, in, a, decrease, in, the, flow, velocity, which, diminishes, the, ability, of, the, flow, to, transport, sediment, as, a, result, sediment, drops, out, of, the, flow, and, is, deposited, as, alluvium, which, builds, up, to, form, the, river, delta, over, time, this, single, channel, builds, a, deltaic, lobe, such, as, the, bird, s, foot, of, the, mississippi, or, ural, river, deltas, pushing, its, mouth, into, the, standing, water, as, the, deltaic, lobe, advances, the, gradient, of, the, river, channel, becomes, lower, because, the, river, channel, is, longer, but, has, the, same, change, in, elevation, see, slope, as, the, gradient, of, the, river, channel, decreases, the, amount, of, shear, stress, on, the, bed, decreases, which, results, in, the, deposition, of, sediment, within, the, channel, and, a, rise, in, the, channel, bed, relative, to, the, floodplain, this, destabilizes, the, river, channel, if, the, river, breaches, its, natural, levees, such, as, during, a, flood, it, spills, out, into, a, new, course, with, a, shorter, route, to, the, ocean, thereby, obtaining, a, steeper, more, stable, gradient, typically, when, the, river, switches, channels, in, this, manner, some, of, its, flow, remains, in, the, abandoned, channel, repeated, channel, switching, events, build, up, a, mature, delta, with, a, distributary, network, another, way, these, distributary, networks, form, is, from, the, deposition, of, mouth, bars, mid, channel, sand, and, or, gravel, bars, at, the, mouth, of, a, river, when, this, mid, channel, bar, is, deposited, at, the, mouth, of, a, river, the, flow, is, routed, around, it, this, results, in, additional, deposition, on, the, upstream, end, of, the, mouth, bar, which, splits, the, river, into, two, distributary, channels, a, good, example, of, the, result, of, this, process, is, the, wax, lake, delta, in, both, of, these, cases, depositional, processes, force, redistribution, of, deposition, from, areas, of, high, deposition, to, areas, of, low, deposition, this, results, in, the, smoothing, of, the, planform, or, map, view, shape, of, the, delta, as, the, channels, move, across, its, surface, and, deposit, sediment, because, the, sediment, is, laid, down, in, this, fashion, the, shape, of, these, deltas, approximates, a, fan, the, more, often, the, flow, changes, course, the, shape, develops, closer, to, an, ideal, fan, because, more, rapid, changes, in, channel, position, result, in, a, more, uniform, deposition, of, sediment, on, the, delta, front, the, mississippi, and, ural, river, deltas, with, their, bird, s, feet, are, examples, of, rivers, that, do, not, avulse, often, enough, to, form, a, symmetrical, fan, shape, alluvial, fan, deltas, as, seen, by, their, name, avulse, frequently, and, more, closely, approximate, an, ideal, fan, shape, most, large, river, deltas, discharge, to, intra, cratonic, basins, on, the, trailing, edges, of, passive, margins, due, to, the, majority, of, large, rivers, such, as, the, mississippi, nile, amazon, ganges, indus, yangtze, and, yellow, river, discharging, along, passive, continental, margins, this, phenomenon, is, due, mainly, to, three, factors, topography, basin, area, and, basin, elevation, topography, along, passive, margins, tend, to, be, more, gradual, and, widespread, over, a, greater, area, enabling, sediment, to, pile, up, and, accumulate, over, time, to, form, large, river, deltas, topography, along, active, margins, tends, to, be, steeper, and, less, widespread, which, results, in, sediments, not, having, the, ability, to, pile, up, and, accumulate, due, to, the, sediment, traveling, into, a, steep, subduction, trench, rather, than, a, shallow, continental, shelf, there, are, many, other, lesser, factors, that, could, explain, why, the, majority, of, river, deltas, form, along, passive, margins, rather, than, active, margins, along, active, margins, orogenic, sequences, cause, tectonic, activity, to, form, over, steepened, slopes, brecciated, rocks, and, volcanic, activity, resulting, in, delta, formation, to, exist, closer, to, the, sediment, source, when, sediment, does, not, travel, far, from, the, source, sediments, that, build, up, are, coarser, grained, and, more, loosely, consolidated, therefore, making, delta, formation, more, difficult, tectonic, activity, on, active, margins, causes, the, formation, of, river, deltas, to, form, closer, to, the, sediment, source, which, may, affect, channel, avulsion, delta, lobe, switching, and, auto, cyclicity, active, margin, river, deltas, tend, to, be, much, smaller, and, less, abundant, but, may, transport, similar, amounts, of, sediment, however, the, sediment, is, never, piled, up, in, thick, sequences, due, to, the, sediment, traveling, and, depositing, in, deep, subduction, trenches, at, the, mouth, of, a, river, the, change, in, flow, conditions, can, cause, the, river, to, drop, any, sediment, it, is, carrying, this, sediment, deposition, can, generate, a, variety, of, landforms, such, as, deltas, sand, bars, spits, and, tie, channels, landforms, at, the, river, mouth, drastically, alter, the, geomorphology, and, ecosystem, deltas, are, typically, classified, according, to, the, main, control, on, deposition, which, is, a, combination, of, river, wave, and, tidal, processes, depending, on, the, strength, of, each, the, other, two, factors, that, play, a, major, role, are, landscape, position, and, the, grain, size, distribution, of, the, source, sediment, entering, the, delta, from, the, river, fluvial, dominated, deltas, are, found, in, areas, of, low, tidal, range, and, low, wave, energy, where, the, river, water, is, nearly, equal, in, density, to, the, basin, water, the, delta, is, characterized, by, homopycnal, flow, in, which, the, river, water, rapidly, mixes, with, basin, water, and, abruptly, dumps, most, of, its, sediment, load, where, the, river, water, has, a, higher, density, than, basin, water, typically, from, a, heavy, load, of, sediment, the, delta, is, characterized, by, hyperpycnal, flow, in, which, the, river, water, hugs, the, basin, bottom, as, a, density, current, that, deposits, its, sediments, as, turbidites, when, the, river, water, is, less, dense, than, the, basin, water, as, is, typical, of, river, deltas, on, an, ocean, coastline, the, delta, is, characterized, by, hypopycnal, flow, in, which, the, river, water, is, slow, to, mix, with, the, denser, basin, water, and, spreads, out, as, a, surface, fan, this, allows, fine, sediments, to, be, carried, a, considerable, distance, before, settling, out, of, suspension, beds, in, a, hypocynal, delta, dip, at, a, very, shallow, angle, around, 1, degree, fluvial, dominated, deltas, are, further, distinguished, by, the, relative, importance, of, the, inertia, of, rapidly, flowing, water, the, importance, of, turbulent, bed, friction, beyond, the, river, mouth, and, buoyancy, outflow, dominated, by, inertia, tends, to, form, gilbert, type, deltas, outflow, dominated, by, turbulent, friction, is, prone, to, channel, bifurcation, while, buoyancy, dominated, outflow, produces, long, distributaries, with, narrow, subaqueous, natural, levees, and, few, channel, bifurcations, the, modern, mississippi, river, delta, is, a, good, example, of, a, fluvial, dominated, delta, whose, outflow, is, buoyancy, dominated, channel, abandonment, has, been, frequent, with, seven, distinct, channels, active, over, the, last, 5000, years, other, fluvial, dominated, deltas, include, the, mackenzie, delta, and, the, alta, delta, a, gilbert, delta, named, after, grove, karl, gilbert, is, a, type, of, fluvial, dominated, delta, formed, from, coarse, sediments, as, opposed, to, gently, sloping, muddy, deltas, such, as, that, of, the, mississippi, for, example, a, mountain, river, depositing, sediment, into, a, freshwater, lake, would, form, this, kind, of, delta, it, is, commonly, a, result, of, homopycnal, flow, such, deltas, are, characterized, by, a, tripartite, structure, of, topset, foreset, and, bottomset, beds, river, water, entering, the, lake, rapidly, deposits, its, coarser, sediments, on, the, submerged, face, of, the, delta, forming, steeping, dipping, foreset, beds, the, finer, sediments, are, deposited, on, the, lake, bottom, beyond, this, steep, slope, as, more, gently, dipping, bottomset, beds, behind, the, delta, front, braided, channels, deposit, the, gently, dipping, beds, of, the, topset, on, the, delta, plain, while, some, authors, describe, both, lacustrine, and, marine, locations, of, gilbert, deltas, others, note, that, their, formation, is, more, characteristic, of, the, freshwater, lakes, where, it, is, easier, for, the, river, water, to, mix, with, the, lakewater, faster, as, opposed, to, the, case, of, a, river, falling, into, the, sea, or, a, salt, lake, where, less, dense, fresh, water, brought, by, the, river, stays, on, top, longer, gilbert, himself, first, described, this, type, of, delta, on, lake, bonneville, in, 1885, elsewhere, similar, structures, occur, for, example, at, the, mouths, of, several, creeks, that, flow, into, okanagan, lake, in, british, columbia, and, form, prominent, peninsulas, at, naramata, summerland, and, peachland, in, wave, dominated, deltas, wave, driven, sediment, transport, controls, the, shape, of, the, delta, and, much, of, the, sediment, emanating, from, the, river, mouth, is, deflected, along, the, coastline, the, relationship, between, waves, and, river, deltas, is, quite, variable, and, largely, influenced, by, the, deepwater, wave, regimes, of, the, receiving, basin, with, a, high, wave, energy, near, shore, and, a, steeper, slope, offshore, waves, will, make, river, deltas, smoother, waves, can, also, be, responsible, for, carrying, sediments, away, from, the, river, delta, causing, the, delta, to, retreat, for, deltas, that, form, further, upriver, in, an, estuary, there, are, complex, yet, quantifiable, linkages, between, winds, tides, river, discharge, and, delta, water, levels, erosion, is, also, an, important, control, in, tide, dominated, deltas, such, as, the, ganges, delta, which, may, be, mainly, submarine, with, prominent, sandbars, and, ridges, this, tends, to, produce, a, dendritic, structure, tidal, deltas, behave, differently, from, river, dominated, and, wave, dominated, deltas, which, tend, to, have, a, few, main, distributaries, once, a, wave, dominated, or, river, dominated, distributary, silts, up, it, is, abandoned, and, a, new, channel, forms, elsewhere, in, a, tidal, delta, new, distributaries, are, formed, during, times, when, there, is, a, lot, of, water, around, such, as, floods, or, storm, surges, these, distributaries, slowly, silt, up, at, a, more, or, less, constant, rate, until, they, fizzle, out, a, tidal, freshwater, delta, is, a, sedimentary, deposit, formed, at, the, boundary, between, an, upland, stream, and, an, estuary, in, the, region, known, as, the, subestuary, drowned, coastal, river, valleys, that, were, inundated, by, rising, sea, levels, during, the, late, pleistocene, and, subsequent, holocene, tend, to, have, dendritic, estuaries, with, many, feeder, tributaries, each, tributary, mimics, this, salinity, gradient, from, its, brackish, junction, with, the, mainstem, estuary, up, to, the, fresh, stream, feeding, the, head, of, tidal, propagation, as, a, result, the, tributaries, are, considered, to, be, subestuaries, the, origin, and, evolution, of, a, tidal, freshwater, delta, involves, processes, that, are, typical, of, all, deltas, as, well, as, processes, that, are, unique, to, the, tidal, freshwater, setting, the, combination, of, processes, that, create, a, tidal, freshwater, delta, result, in, a, distinct, morphology, and, unique, environmental, characteristics, many, tidal, freshwater, deltas, that, exist, today, are, directly, caused, by, the, onset, of, or, changes, in, historical, land, use, especially, deforestation, intensive, agriculture, and, urbanization, these, ideas, are, well, illustrated, by, the, many, tidal, freshwater, deltas, prograding, into, chesapeake, bay, along, the, east, coastline, of, the, united, states, research, has, demonstrated, that, the, accumulating, sediments, in, this, estuary, derive, from, post, european, settlement, deforestation, agriculture, and, urban, development, other, rivers, particularly, those, on, coasts, with, significant, tidal, range, do, not, form, a, delta, but, enter, into, the, sea, in, the, form, of, an, estuary, notable, examples, include, the, gulf, of, saint, lawrence, and, the, tagus, estuary, in, rare, cases, the, river, delta, is, located, inside, a, large, valley, and, is, called, an, inverted, river, delta, sometimes, a, river, divides, into, multiple, branches, in, an, inland, area, only, to, rejoin, and, continue, to, the, sea, such, an, area, is, called, an, inland, delta, and, often, occurs, on, former, lake, beds, the, term, was, first, coined, by, alexander, von, humboldt, for, the, middle, reaches, of, the, orinoco, river, which, he, visited, in, 1800, other, prominent, examples, include, the, inner, niger, delta, peace, athabasca, delta, the, sacramento, san, joaquin, river, delta, and, the, sistan, delta, of, iran, the, danube, has, one, in, the, valley, on, the, slovak, hungarian, border, between, bratislava, and, i, a, in, some, cases, a, river, flowing, into, a, flat, arid, area, splits, into, channels, that, evaporate, as, it, progresses, into, the, desert, the, okavango, delta, in, botswana, is, one, example, see, endorheic, basin, the, generic, term, mega, delta, can, be, used, to, describe, very, large, asian, river, deltas, such, as, the, yangtze, pearl, red, mekong, irrawaddy, ganges, brahmaputra, and, indus, the, formation, of, a, delta, is, complicated, multiple, and, cross, cutting, over, time, but, in, a, simple, delta, three, main, types, of, bedding, may, be, distinguished, the, bottomset, beds, foreset, frontset, beds, and, topset, beds, this, three, part, structure, may, be, seen, on, small, scale, by, crossbedding, human, activities, in, both, deltas, and, the, river, basins, upstream, of, deltas, can, radically, alter, delta, environments, upstream, land, use, change, such, as, anti, erosion, agricultural, practices, and, hydrological, engineering, such, as, dam, construction, in, the, basins, feeding, deltas, have, reduced, river, sediment, delivery, to, many, deltas, in, recent, decades, this, change, means, that, there, is, less, sediment, available, to, maintain, delta, landforms, and, compensate, for, erosion, and, sea, level, rise, causing, some, deltas, to, start, losing, land, declines, in, river, sediment, delivery, are, projected, to, continue, in, the, coming, decades, the, extensive, anthropogenic, activities, in, deltas, also, interfere, with, geomorphological, and, ecological, delta, processes, people, living, on, deltas, often, construct, flood, defences, which, prevent, sedimentation, from, floods, on, deltas, and, therefore, means, that, sediment, deposition, can, not, compensate, for, subsidence, and, erosion, in, addition, to, interference, with, delta, aggradation, pumping, of, groundwater, oil, and, gas, and, constructing, infrastructure, all, accelerate, subsidence, increasing, relative, sea, level, rise, anthropogenic, activities, can, also, destabilise, river, channels, through, sand, mining, and, cause, saltwater, intrusion, there, are, small, scale, efforts, to, correct, these, issues, improve, delta, environments, and, increase, environmental, sustainability, through, sedimentation, enhancing, strategies, while, nearly, all, deltas, have, been, impacted, to, some, degree, by, humans, the, nile, delta, and, colorado, river, delta, are, some, of, the, most, extreme, examples, of, the, devastation, caused, to, deltas, by, damming, and, diversion, of, water, historical, data, documents, show, that, during, the, roman, empire, and, little, ice, age, times, when, there, was, considerable, anthropogenic, pressure, there, was, significant, sediment, accumulation, in, deltas, the, industrial, revolution, has, only, amplified, the, impact, of, humans, on, delta, growth, and, retreat, ancient, deltas, are, a, benefit, to, the, economy, due, to, their, well, sorted, sand, and, gravel, sand, and, gravel, are, often, quarried, from, these, old, deltas, and, used, in, concrete, for, highways, buildings, sidewalks, and, even, landscaping, more, than, 1, billion, tons, of, sand, and, gravel, are, produced, in, the, united, states, alone, not, all, sand, and, gravel, quarries, are, former, deltas, but, for, ones, that, are, much, of, the, sorting, is, already, done, by, the, power, of, water, urban, areas, and, human, habitation, tend, to, be, located, in, lowlands, near, water, access, for, transportation, and, sanitation, this, makes, deltas, a, common, location, for, civilizations, to, flourish, due, to, access, to, flat, land, for, farming, freshwater, for, sanitation, and, irrigation, and, sea, access, for, trade, deltas, often, host, extensive, industrial, and, commercial, activities, as, well, as, agricultural, land, which, are, often, in, conflict, some, of, the, world, s, largest, regional, economies, are, located, on, deltas, such, as, the, pearl, river, delta, yangtze, river, delta, european, low, countries, and, the, greater, tokyo, area, the, ganges, brahmaputra, delta, which, spans, most, of, bangladesh, and, west, bengal, and, empties, into, the, bay, of, bengal, is, the, world, s, largest, delta, the, selenga, river, delta, in, the, russian, republic, of, buryatia, is, the, largest, delta, emptying, into, a, body, of, fresh, water, in, its, case, lake, baikal, researchers, have, found, a, number, of, examples, of, deltas, that, formed, in, martian, lakes, finding, deltas, is, a, major, sign, that, mars, once, had, large, amounts, of, water, deltas, have, been, found, over, a, wide, geographical, range, below, are, pictures, of, a, few
