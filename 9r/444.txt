a, chemical, compound, is, a, chemical, substance, composed, of, many, identical, molecules, or, molecular, entities, containing, atoms, from, more, than, one, chemical, element, held, together, by, chemical, bonds, a, molecule, consisting, of, atoms, of, only, one, element, is, therefore, not, a, compound, a, compound, can, be, transformed, into, a, different, substance, by, a, chemical, reaction, which, may, involve, interactions, with, other, substances, in, this, process, bonds, between, atoms, may, be, broken, and, or, new, bonds, formed, there, are, four, major, types, of, compounds, distinguished, by, how, the, constituent, atoms, are, bonded, together, molecular, compounds, are, held, together, by, covalent, bonds, ionic, compounds, are, held, together, by, ionic, bonds, intermetallic, compounds, are, held, together, by, metallic, bonds, coordination, complexes, are, held, together, by, coordinate, covalent, bonds, non, stoichiometric, compounds, form, a, disputed, marginal, case, a, chemical, formula, specifies, the, number, of, atoms, of, each, element, in, a, compound, molecule, using, the, standard, chemical, symbols, with, numerical, subscripts, many, chemical, compounds, have, a, unique, cas, number, identifier, assigned, by, the, chemical, abstracts, service, globally, more, than, 350, 000, chemical, compounds, including, mixtures, of, chemicals, have, been, registered, for, production, and, use, the, term, compound, with, a, meaning, similar, to, the, modern, has, been, used, at, least, since, 1661, when, robert, boyle, s, the, sceptical, chymist, was, published, in, this, book, boyle, variously, used, the, terms, compound, compounded, body, perfectly, mixt, body, and, concrete, perfectly, mixt, bodies, included, for, example, gold, lead, mercury, and, wine, while, the, distinction, between, compound, and, mixture, is, not, so, clear, the, distinction, between, element, and, compound, is, a, central, theme, quicksilver, with, aqua, fortis, will, be, brought, into, a, white, powder, with, sulphur, it, will, compose, a, blood, red, and, volatile, cinaber, and, yet, out, of, all, these, exotick, compounds, we, may, recover, the, very, same, running, mercury, boyle, used, the, concept, of, corpuscles, or, atomes, as, he, also, called, them, to, explain, how, a, limited, number, of, elements, could, combine, into, a, vast, number, of, compounds, if, we, assigne, to, the, corpuscles, whereof, each, element, consists, a, peculiar, size, and, shape, such, corpuscles, may, be, mingled, in, such, various, proportions, and, connected, so, many, wayes, that, an, almost, incredible, number, of, concretes, may, be, compos, d, of, them, in, his, logick, published, in, 1724, the, english, minister, and, logician, isaac, watts, gave, an, early, definition, of, chemical, element, and, contrasted, element, with, chemical, compound, in, clear, modern, terms, among, substances, some, are, called, simple, some, are, compound, simple, substances, are, usually, called, elements, of, which, all, other, bodies, are, compounded, elements, are, such, substances, as, cannot, be, resolved, or, reduced, into, two, or, more, substances, of, different, kinds, followers, of, aristotle, made, fire, air, earth, and, water, to, be, the, four, elements, of, which, all, earthly, things, were, compounded, and, they, suppos, d, the, heavens, to, be, a, quintessence, or, fifth, sort, of, body, distinct, from, all, these, but, since, experimental, philosophy, have, been, better, understood, this, doctrine, has, been, abundantly, refuted, the, chymists, make, spirit, salt, sulphur, water, and, earth, to, be, their, five, elements, because, they, can, reduce, all, terrestrial, things, to, these, five, this, seems, to, come, nearer, the, truth, tho, they, are, not, all, agreed, compound, substances, are, made, up, of, two, or, more, simple, substances, so, a, needle, is, simple, body, being, made, only, of, steel, but, a, sword, or, a, knife, is, a, compound, because, its, handle, is, made, of, materials, different, from, the, blade, any, substance, consisting, of, two, or, more, different, types, of, atoms, chemical, elements, in, a, fixed, stoichiometric, proportion, can, be, termed, a, chemical, compound, the, concept, is, most, readily, understood, when, considering, pure, chemical, substances, 15, it, follows, from, their, being, composed, of, fixed, proportions, of, two, or, more, types, of, atoms, that, chemical, compounds, can, be, converted, via, chemical, reaction, into, compounds, or, substances, each, having, fewer, atoms, a, chemical, formula, is, a, way, of, expressing, information, about, the, proportions, of, atoms, that, constitute, a, particular, chemical, compound, using, chemical, symbols, for, the, chemical, elements, and, subscripts, to, indicate, the, number, of, atoms, involved, for, example, water, is, composed, of, two, hydrogen, atoms, bonded, to, one, oxygen, atom, the, chemical, formula, is, h, 2, o, in, the, case, of, non, stoichiometric, compounds, the, proportions, may, be, reproducible, with, regard, to, their, preparation, and, give, fixed, proportions, of, their, component, elements, but, proportions, that, are, not, integral, chemical, compounds, have, a, unique, and, defined, chemical, structure, held, together, in, a, defined, spatial, arrangement, by, chemical, bonds, chemical, compounds, can, be, molecular, compounds, held, together, by, covalent, bonds, salts, held, together, by, ionic, bonds, intermetallic, compounds, held, together, by, metallic, bonds, or, the, subset, of, chemical, complexes, that, are, held, together, by, coordinate, covalent, bonds, pure, chemical, elements, are, generally, not, considered, chemical, compounds, failing, the, two, or, more, atom, requirement, though, they, often, consist, of, molecules, composed, of, multiple, atoms, such, as, in, the, diatomic, molecule, h, 2, or, the, polyatomic, molecule, s, 8, etc, many, chemical, compounds, have, a, unique, numerical, identifier, assigned, by, the, chemical, abstracts, service, cas, its, cas, number, there, is, varying, and, sometimes, inconsistent, nomenclature, differentiating, substances, which, include, truly, non, stoichiometric, examples, from, chemical, compounds, which, require, the, fixed, ratios, many, solid, chemical, substances, for, example, many, silicate, minerals, are, chemical, substances, but, do, not, have, simple, formulae, reflecting, chemically, bonding, of, elements, to, one, another, in, fixed, ratios, even, so, these, crystalline, substances, are, often, called, non, stoichiometric, compounds, it, may, be, argued, that, they, are, related, to, rather, than, being, chemical, compounds, insofar, as, the, variability, in, their, compositions, is, often, due, to, either, the, presence, of, foreign, elements, trapped, within, the, crystal, structure, of, an, otherwise, known, true, chemical, compound, or, due, to, perturbations, in, structure, relative, to, the, known, compound, that, arise, because, of, an, excess, of, deficit, of, the, constituent, elements, at, places, in, its, structure, such, non, stoichiometric, substances, form, most, of, the, crust, and, mantle, of, the, earth, other, compounds, regarded, as, chemically, identical, may, have, varying, amounts, of, heavy, or, light, isotopes, of, the, constituent, elements, which, changes, the, ratio, of, elements, by, mass, slightly, a, molecule, is, an, electrically, neutral, group, of, two, or, more, atoms, held, together, by, chemical, bonds, a, molecule, may, be, homonuclear, that, is, it, consists, of, atoms, of, one, chemical, element, as, with, two, atoms, in, the, oxygen, molecule, o, 2, or, it, may, be, heteronuclear, a, chemical, compound, composed, of, more, than, one, element, as, with, water, two, hydrogen, atoms, and, one, oxygen, atom, h, 2, o, a, molecule, is, the, smallest, unit, of, a, substance, that, still, carries, all, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, that, substance, an, ionic, compound, is, a, chemical, compound, composed, of, ions, held, together, by, electrostatic, forces, termed, ionic, bonding, the, compound, is, neutral, overall, but, consists, of, positively, charged, ions, called, cations, and, negatively, charged, ions, called, anions, these, can, be, simple, ions, such, as, the, sodium, na, and, chloride, cl, in, sodium, chloride, or, polyatomic, species, such, as, the, ammonium, nh, 4, and, carbonate, co, 2, 3, ions, in, ammonium, carbonate, individual, ions, within, an, ionic, compound, usually, have, multiple, nearest, neighbours, so, are, not, considered, to, be, part, of, molecules, but, instead, part, of, a, continuous, three, dimensional, network, usually, in, a, crystalline, structure, ionic, compounds, containing, basic, ions, hydroxide, oh, or, oxide, o, 2, are, classified, as, bases, ionic, compounds, without, these, ions, are, also, known, as, salts, and, can, be, formed, by, acid, base, reactions, ionic, compounds, can, also, be, produced, from, their, constituent, ions, by, evaporation, of, their, solvent, precipitation, freezing, a, solid, state, reaction, or, the, electron, transfer, reaction, of, reactive, metals, with, reactive, non, metals, such, as, halogen, gases, ionic, compounds, typically, have, high, melting, and, boiling, points, and, are, hard, and, brittle, as, solids, they, are, almost, always, electrically, insulating, but, when, melted, or, dissolved, they, become, highly, conductive, because, the, ions, are, mobilized, an, intermetallic, compound, is, a, type, of, metallic, alloy, that, forms, an, ordered, solid, state, compound, between, two, or, more, metallic, elements, intermetallics, are, generally, hard, and, brittle, with, good, high, temperature, mechanical, properties, they, can, be, classified, as, stoichiometric, or, nonstoichiometric, intermetallic, compounds, a, coordination, complex, consists, of, a, central, atom, or, ion, which, is, usually, metallic, and, is, called, the, coordination, centre, and, a, surrounding, array, of, bound, molecules, or, ions, that, are, in, turn, known, as, ligands, or, complexing, agents, many, metal, containing, compounds, especially, those, of, transition, metals, are, coordination, complexes, a, coordination, complex, whose, centre, is, a, metal, atom, is, called, a, metal, complex, of, d, block, element, compounds, are, held, together, through, a, variety, of, different, types, of, bonding, and, forces, the, differences, in, the, types, of, bonds, in, compounds, differ, based, on, the, types, of, elements, present, in, the, compound, london, dispersion, forces, are, the, weakest, force, of, all, intermolecular, forces, they, are, temporary, attractive, forces, that, form, when, the, electrons, in, two, adjacent, atoms, are, positioned, so, that, they, create, a, temporary, dipole, additionally, london, dispersion, forces, are, responsible, for, condensing, non, polar, substances, to, liquids, and, to, further, freeze, to, a, solid, state, dependent, on, how, low, the, temperature, of, the, environment, is, a, covalent, bond, also, known, as, a, molecular, bond, involves, the, sharing, of, electrons, between, two, atoms, primarily, this, type, of, bond, occurs, between, elements, that, fall, close, to, each, other, on, the, periodic, table, of, elements, yet, it, is, observed, between, some, metals, and, nonmetals, this, is, due, to, the, mechanism, of, this, type, of, bond, elements, that, fall, close, to, each, other, on, the, periodic, table, tend, to, have, similar, electronegativities, which, means, they, have, a, similar, affinity, for, electrons, since, neither, element, has, a, stronger, affinity, to, donate, or, gain, electrons, it, causes, the, elements, to, share, electrons, so, both, elements, have, a, more, stable, octet, ionic, bonding, occurs, when, valence, electrons, are, completely, transferred, between, elements, opposite, to, covalent, bonding, this, chemical, bond, creates, two, oppositely, charged, ions, the, metals, in, ionic, bonding, usually, lose, their, valence, electrons, becoming, a, positively, charged, cation, the, nonmetal, will, gain, the, electrons, from, the, metal, making, the, nonmetal, a, negatively, charged, anion, as, outlined, ionic, bonds, occur, between, an, electron, donor, usually, a, metal, and, an, electron, acceptor, which, tends, to, be, a, nonmetal, hydrogen, bonding, occurs, when, a, hydrogen, atom, bonded, to, an, electronegative, atom, forms, an, electrostatic, connection, with, another, electronegative, atom, through, interacting, dipoles, or, charges, a, compound, can, be, converted, to, a, different, chemical, composition, by, interaction, with, a, second, chemical, compound, via, a, chemical, reaction, in, this, process, bonds, between, atoms, are, broken, in, both, of, the, interacting, compounds, and, then, bonds, are, reformed, so, that, new, associations, are, made, between, atoms, schematically, this, reaction, could, be, described, as, ab, cd, ad, cb, where, a, b, c, and, d, are, each, unique, atoms, and, ab, ad, cd, and, cb, are, each, unique, compounds
