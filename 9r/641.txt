in, physical, geography, a, fjord, or, fiord, f, j, r, d, f, i, r, d, is, a, long, narrow, sea, inlet, with, steep, sides, or, cliffs, created, by, a, glacier, fjords, exist, on, the, coasts, of, antarctica, the, arctic, and, surrounding, landmasses, of, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, norway, s, coastline, is, estimated, to, be, 29, 000, km, 18, 000, mi, long, with, its, nearly, 1, 200, fjords, but, only, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, long, excluding, the, fjords, a, true, fjord, is, formed, when, a, glacier, cuts, a, u, shaped, valley, by, ice, segregation, and, abrasion, of, the, surrounding, bedrock, according, to, the, standard, model, glaciers, formed, in, pre, glacial, valleys, with, a, gently, sloping, valley, floor, the, work, of, the, glacier, then, left, an, overdeepened, u, shaped, valley, that, ends, abruptly, at, a, valley, or, trough, end, such, valleys, are, fjords, when, flooded, by, the, ocean, thresholds, above, sea, level, create, freshwater, lakes, glacial, melting, is, accompanied, by, the, rebounding, of, earth, s, crust, as, the, ice, load, and, eroded, sediment, is, removed, also, called, isostasy, or, glacial, rebound, in, some, cases, this, rebound, is, faster, than, sea, level, rise, most, fjords, are, deeper, than, the, adjacent, sea, sognefjord, norway, reaches, as, much, as, 1, 300, m, 4, 265, ft, below, sea, level, fjords, generally, have, a, sill, or, shoal, bedrock, at, their, mouth, caused, by, the, previous, glacier, s, reduced, erosion, rate, and, terminal, moraine, in, many, cases, this, sill, causes, extreme, currents, and, large, saltwater, rapids, see, skookumchuck, saltstraumen, in, norway, is, often, described, as, the, world, s, strongest, tidal, current, these, characteristics, distinguish, fjords, from, rias, such, as, the, bay, of, kotor, which, are, drowned, valleys, flooded, by, the, rising, sea, drammensfjorden, is, cut, almost, in, two, by, the, svelvik, ridge, a, sandy, moraine, that, was, below, sea, level, when, it, was, covered, by, ice, but, after, the, post, glacial, rebound, reaches, 60, m, 200, ft, above, the, fjord, in, the, 19th, century, jens, esmark, introduced, the, theory, that, fjords, are, or, have, been, created, by, glaciers, and, that, large, parts, of, northern, europe, had, been, covered, by, thick, ice, in, prehistory, thresholds, at, the, mouths, and, overdeepening, of, fjords, compared, to, the, ocean, are, the, strongest, evidence, of, glacial, origin, and, these, thresholds, are, mostly, rocky, thresholds, are, related, to, sounds, and, low, land, where, the, ice, could, spread, out, and, therefore, have, less, erosive, force, john, walter, gregory, argued, that, fjords, are, of, tectonic, origin, and, that, glaciers, had, a, negligible, role, in, their, formation, gregory, s, views, were, rejected, by, subsequent, research, and, publications, in, the, case, of, hardangerfjord, the, fractures, of, the, caledonian, fold, has, guided, the, erosion, by, glaciers, while, there, is, no, clear, relation, between, the, direction, of, sognefjord, and, the, fold, pattern, this, relationship, between, fractures, and, direction, of, fjords, is, also, observed, in, lyngen, preglacial, tertiary, rivers, presumably, eroded, the, surface, and, created, valleys, that, later, guided, the, glacial, flow, and, erosion, of, the, bedrock, this, may, in, particular, have, been, the, case, in, western, norway, where, the, tertiary, uplift, of, the, landmass, amplified, eroding, forces, of, rivers, confluence, of, tributary, fjords, led, to, excavation, of, the, deepest, fjord, basins, near, the, very, coast, the, typical, west, norwegian, glacier, spread, out, presumably, through, sounds, and, low, valleys, and, lost, their, concentration, and, reduced, the, glaciers, power, to, erode, leaving, bedrock, thresholds, bolstadfjorden, is, 160, m, 520, ft, deep, with, a, threshold, of, only, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, while, the, 1, 300, m, 4, 300, ft, deep, sognefjorden, has, a, threshold, around, 100, to, 200, m, 330, to, 660, ft, deep, hardangerfjord, is, made, up, of, several, basins, separated, by, thresholds, the, deepest, basin, samlafjorden, between, jonaneset, jondal, and, lvik, with, a, distinct, threshold, at, vikingneset, in, kvam, municipality, hanging, valleys, are, common, along, glaciated, fjords, and, u, shaped, valleys, a, hanging, valley, is, a, tributary, valley, that, is, higher, than, the, main, valley, and, was, created, by, tributary, glacier, flows, into, a, glacier, of, larger, volume, the, shallower, valley, appears, to, be, hanging, above, the, main, valley, or, a, fjord, often, waterfalls, form, at, or, near, the, outlet, of, the, upper, valley, small, waterfalls, within, these, fjords, are, also, used, as, freshwater, resources, hanging, valleys, also, occur, underwater, in, fjord, systems, the, branches, of, sognefjord, are, for, instance, much, shallower, than, the, main, fjord, the, mouth, of, fj, rlandsfjord, is, about, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, deep, while, the, main, fjord, is, 1, 200, m, 3, 900, ft, nearby, the, mouth, of, ikjefjord, is, only, 50, m, 160, ft, deep, while, the, main, fjord, is, around, 1, 300, m, 4, 300, ft, at, the, same, point, during, the, winter, season, there, is, usually, little, inflow, of, freshwater, surface, water, and, deeper, water, down, to, 100, m, or, 330, ft, or, more, are, mixed, during, winter, because, of, the, steady, cooling, of, the, surface, and, wind, in, the, deep, fjords, there, is, still, fresh, water, from, the, summer, with, less, density, than, the, saltier, water, along, the, coast, offshore, wind, common, in, the, fjord, areas, during, winter, sets, up, a, current, on, the, surface, from, the, inner, to, the, outer, parts, this, current, on, the, surface, in, turn, pulls, dense, salt, water, from, the, coast, across, the, fjord, threshold, and, into, the, deepest, parts, of, the, fjord, bolstadfjorden, has, a, threshold, of, only, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, and, strong, inflow, of, freshwater, from, vosso, river, creates, a, brackish, surface, that, blocks, circulation, of, the, deep, fjord, the, deeper, salt, layers, of, bolstadfjorden, are, deprived, of, oxygen, and, the, seabed, is, covered, with, organic, material, the, shallow, threshold, also, creates, a, strong, tidal, current, during, the, summer, season, there, is, usually, a, large, inflow, of, river, water, in, the, inner, areas, this, freshwater, gets, mixed, with, saltwater, creating, a, layer, of, brackish, water, with, a, slightly, higher, surface, than, the, ocean, which, in, turn, sets, up, a, current, from, the, river, mouths, towards, the, ocean, this, current, is, gradually, more, salty, towards, the, coast, and, right, under, the, surface, current, there, is, a, reverse, current, of, saltier, water, from, the, coast, in, the, deeper, parts, of, the, fjord, the, cold, water, remaining, from, winter, is, still, and, separated, from, the, atmosphere, by, the, brackish, top, layer, this, deep, water, is, ventilated, by, mixing, with, the, upper, layer, causing, it, to, warm, and, freshen, over, the, summer, in, fjords, with, a, shallow, threshold, or, low, levels, of, mixing, this, deep, water, is, not, replaced, every, year, and, low, oxygen, concentration, makes, the, deep, water, unsuitable, for, fish, and, animals, in, the, most, extreme, cases, there, is, a, constant, barrier, of, freshwater, on, the, surface, and, the, fjord, freezes, over, such, that, there, is, no, oxygen, below, the, surface, drammensfjorden, is, one, example, the, mixing, in, fjords, predominantly, results, from, the, propagation, of, an, internal, tide, from, the, entrance, sill, or, internal, seiching, the, gaupnefjorden, branch, of, sognefjorden, is, strongly, affected, by, freshwater, as, a, glacial, river, flows, in, velfjorden, has, little, inflow, of, freshwater, in, 2000, some, coral, reefs, were, discovered, along, the, bottoms, of, the, norwegian, fjords, these, reefs, were, found, in, fjords, from, the, north, of, norway, to, the, south, the, marine, life, on, the, reefs, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, reasons, why, the, norwegian, coastline, is, such, a, generous, fishing, ground, since, this, discovery, is, fairly, new, little, research, has, been, done, the, reefs, are, host, to, thousands, of, lifeforms, such, as, plankton, coral, anemones, fish, several, species, of, shark, and, many, more, most, are, specially, adapted, to, life, under, the, greater, pressure, of, the, water, column, above, it, and, the, total, darkness, of, the, deep, sea, new, zealand, s, fjords, are, also, host, to, deep, water, corals, but, a, surface, layer, of, dark, fresh, water, allows, these, corals, to, grow, in, much, shallower, water, than, usual, an, underwater, observatory, in, milford, sound, allows, tourists, to, view, them, without, diving, in, some, places, near, the, seaward, margins, of, areas, with, fjords, the, ice, scoured, channels, are, so, numerous, and, varied, in, direction, that, the, rocky, coast, is, divided, into, thousands, of, island, blocks, some, large, and, mountainous, while, others, are, merely, rocky, points, or, rock, reefs, menacing, navigation, these, are, called, skerries, the, term, skerry, is, derived, from, the, old, norse, sker, which, means, a, rock, in, the, sea, skerries, most, commonly, formed, at, the, outlet, of, fjords, where, submerged, glacially, formed, valleys, perpendicular, to, the, coast, join, with, other, cross, valleys, in, a, complex, array, the, island, fringe, of, norway, is, such, a, group, of, skerries, called, a, skj, rg, rd, many, of, the, cross, fjords, are, so, arranged, that, they, parallel, the, coast, and, provide, a, protected, channel, behind, an, almost, unbroken, succession, of, mountainous, islands, and, skerries, by, this, channel, one, can, travel, through, a, protected, passage, almost, the, entire, 1, 601, km, 995, mi, route, from, stavanger, to, north, cape, norway, the, blindleia, is, a, skerry, protected, waterway, that, starts, near, kristiansand, in, southern, norway, and, continues, past, lillesand, the, swedish, coast, along, bohusl, n, is, likewise, skerry, guarded, the, inside, passage, provides, a, similar, route, from, seattle, washington, and, vancouver, british, columbia, to, skagway, alaska, yet, another, such, skerry, protected, passage, extends, from, the, straits, of, magellan, north, for, 800, km, 500, mi, fjords, provide, unique, environmental, conditions, for, phytoplankton, communities, in, polar, fjords, glacier, and, ice, sheet, outflow, add, cold, fresh, meltwater, along, with, transported, sediment, into, the, body, of, water, nutrients, provided, by, this, outflow, can, significantly, enhance, phytoplankton, growth, for, example, in, some, fjords, of, the, west, antarctic, peninsula, wap, nutrient, enrichment, from, meltwater, drives, diatom, blooms, a, highly, productive, group, of, phytoplankton, that, enable, such, fjords, to, be, valuable, feeding, grounds, for, other, species, it, is, possible, that, as, climate, change, reduces, long, term, meltwater, output, nutrient, dynamics, within, such, fjords, will, shift, to, favor, less, productive, species, destabilizing, the, food, web, ecology, of, fjord, systems, in, addition, to, nutrient, flux, sediment, carried, by, flowing, glaciers, can, become, suspended, in, the, water, column, increasing, turbidity, and, reducing, light, penetration, into, greater, depths, of, the, fjord, this, effect, can, limit, the, available, light, for, photosynthesis, in, deeper, areas, of, the, water, mass, reducing, phytoplankton, abundance, beneath, the, surface, overall, phytoplankton, abundance, and, species, composition, within, fjords, is, highly, seasonal, varying, as, a, result, of, seasonal, light, availability, and, water, properties, that, depend, on, glacial, melt, and, the, formation, of, sea, ice, the, study, of, phytoplankton, communities, within, fjords, is, an, active, area, of, research, supported, by, groups, such, as, fjordphyto, a, citizen, science, initiative, to, study, phytoplankton, samples, collected, by, local, residents, tourists, and, boaters, of, all, backgrounds, an, epishelf, lake, forms, when, meltwater, is, trapped, behind, a, floating, ice, shelf, and, the, freshwater, floats, on, the, denser, saltwater, below, its, surface, may, freeze, forming, an, isolated, ecosystem, the, word, fjord, is, borrowed, from, norwegian, where, it, is, pronounced, or, in, various, dialects, and, has, a, more, general, meaning, referring, in, many, cases, to, any, long, narrow, body, of, water, inlet, or, channel, for, example, see, oslofjord, the, norwegian, word, is, inherited, from, old, norse, fj, r, r, a, noun, which, refers, to, a, lake, like, body, of, water, used, for, passage, and, ferrying, and, is, closely, related, to, the, noun, fer, travelling, ferrying, journey, both, words, go, back, to, indo, european, p, rtus, crossing, from, the, root, per, cross, the, words, fare, and, ferry, are, of, the, same, origin, the, scandinavian, fjord, proto, scandinavian, fer, uz, is, the, origin, for, similar, germanic, words, icelandic, fj, r, ur, faroese, fj, r, ur, swedish, fj, rd, for, baltic, waterbodies, scots, firth, for, marine, waterbodies, mainly, in, scotland, and, northern, england, the, norse, noun, fj, r, r, was, adopted, in, german, as, f, rde, used, for, the, narrow, long, bays, of, schleswig, holstein, and, in, english, as, firth, fjord, river, mouth, the, english, word, ford, compare, german, furt, low, german, ford, or, v, rde, in, dutch, names, voorde, such, as, vilvoorde, ancient, greek, poros, and, latin, portus, is, assumed, to, originate, from, germanic, fer, u, and, indo, european, root, pertu, meaning, crossing, point, fjord, firth, f, rde, as, well, as, ford, furt, v, rde, voorde, refer, to, a, germanic, noun, for, a, travel, north, germanic, ferd, or, f, rd, and, of, the, verb, to, travel, dutch, varen, german, fahren, english, to, fare, as, a, loanword, from, norwegian, it, is, one, of, the, few, words, in, the, english, language, to, start, with, the, sequence, fj, the, word, was, for, a, long, time, normally, spelled, f, i, ord, a, spelling, preserved, in, place, names, such, as, grise, fiord, the, fiord, spelling, mostly, remains, only, in, new, zealand, english, as, in, the, place, name, fiordland, the, use, of, the, word, fjord, in, norwegian, danish, and, swedish, is, more, general, than, in, english, and, in, international, scientific, terminology, in, scandinavia, fjord, is, used, for, a, narrow, inlet, of, the, sea, in, norway, denmark, and, western, sweden, but, this, is, not, its, only, application, in, norway, and, iceland, the, usage, is, closest, to, the, old, norse, with, fjord, used, for, both, a, firth, and, for, a, long, narrow, inlet, in, eastern, norway, the, term, is, also, applied, to, long, narrow, freshwater, lakes, randsfjorden, and, tyrifjorden, and, sometimes, even, to, rivers, for, instance, in, fl, municipality, in, hallingdal, the, hallingdal, river, is, referred, to, as, fjorden, in, southeast, sweden, the, name, fjard, fj, rd, is, a, subdivision, of, the, term, fjord, used, for, bays, bights, and, narrow, inlets, on, the, swedish, baltic, sea, coast, and, in, most, swedish, lakes, this, latter, term, is, also, used, for, bodies, of, water, off, the, coast, of, finland, where, finland, swedish, is, spoken, in, danish, the, word, may, even, apply, to, shallow, lagoons, in, modern, icelandic, fj, r, ur, is, still, used, with, the, broader, meaning, of, firth, or, inlet, in, faroese, fj, r, ur, is, used, both, about, inlets, and, about, broader, sounds, whereas, a, narrower, sound, is, called, sund, in, the, finnish, language, a, word, vuono, is, used, although, there, is, only, one, fjord, in, finland, in, old, norse, genitive, was, fjar, ar, whereas, dative, was, fir, i, the, dative, form, has, become, common, place, names, like, f, rde, for, instance, f, rde, fyrde, or, f, rre, for, instance, f, rre, the, german, use, of, the, word, f, hrde, for, long, narrow, bays, on, their, baltic, sea, coastline, indicates, a, common, germanic, origin, of, the, word, the, landscape, consists, mainly, of, moraine, heaps, the, f, hrden, and, some, fjords, on, the, east, side, of, jutland, denmark, are, also, of, glacial, origin, but, while, the, glaciers, digging, real, fjords, moved, from, the, mountains, to, the, sea, in, denmark, and, germany, they, were, tongues, of, a, huge, glacier, covering, the, basin, of, which, is, now, the, baltic, sea, see, f, rden, and, east, jutland, fjorde, whereas, fjord, names, mostly, describe, bays, though, not, always, geological, fjords, straits, in, the, same, regions, typically, are, named, sund, in, scandinavian, languages, as, well, as, in, german, the, word, is, related, to, to, sunder, in, the, meaning, of, to, separate, so, the, use, of, sound, to, name, fjords, in, north, america, and, new, zealand, differs, from, the, european, meaning, of, that, word, the, name, of, wexford, in, ireland, is, originally, derived, from, veisafj, r, r, inlet, of, the, mud, flats, in, old, norse, as, used, by, the, viking, settlers, though, the, inlet, at, that, place, in, modern, terms, is, an, estuary, not, a, fjord, similarly, the, name, of, milford, now, milford, haven, in, wales, is, derived, from, melrfj, r, r, sandbank, fjord, inlet, though, the, inlet, on, which, it, is, located, is, actually, a, ria, before, or, in, the, early, phase, of, old, norse, angr, was, another, common, noun, for, fjords, and, other, inlets, of, the, ocean, this, word, has, survived, only, as, a, suffix, in, names, of, some, scandinavian, fjords, and, has, in, same, cases, also, been, transferred, to, adjacent, settlements, or, surrounding, areas, for, instance, hardanger, stavanger, and, geiranger, the, differences, in, usage, between, the, english, and, the, scandinavian, languages, have, contributed, to, confusion, in, the, use, of, the, term, fjord, bodies, of, water, that, are, clearly, fjords, in, scandinavian, languages, are, not, considered, fjords, in, english, similarly, bodies, of, water, that, would, clearly, not, be, fjords, in, the, scandinavian, sense, have, been, named, or, suggested, to, be, fjords, examples, of, this, confused, usage, follow, in, the, danish, language, some, inlets, are, called, a, fjord, but, are, according, to, the, english, language, definition, technically, not, a, fjord, for, example, roskilde, fjord, limfjord, in, english, terminology, is, a, sound, since, it, separates, the, north, jutlandic, island, vendsyssel, thy, from, the, rest, of, jutland, however, the, limfjord, once, was, a, fjord, until, the, sea, broke, through, from, the, west, ringk, bing, fjord, on, the, western, coast, of, jutland, is, a, lagoon, the, long, narrow, fjords, of, denmark, s, baltic, sea, coast, like, the, german, f, rden, were, dug, by, ice, moving, from, the, sea, upon, land, while, fjords, in, the, geological, sense, were, dug, by, ice, moving, from, the, mountains, down, to, the, sea, however, some, definitions, of, a, fjord, is, a, long, narrow, inlet, consisting, of, only, one, inlet, created, by, glacial, activity, examples, of, danish, fjords, are, kolding, fjord, vejle, fjord, and, mariager, fjord, the, fjords, in, finnmark, in, norway, which, are, fjords, in, the, scandinavian, sense, of, the, term, are, not, universally, considered, to, be, fjords, by, the, scientific, community, because, although, glacially, formed, most, finnmark, fjords, lack, the, steep, sided, valleys, of, the, more, southerly, norwegian, fjords, the, glacial, pack, was, deep, enough, to, cover, even, the, high, grounds, when, they, were, formed, the, oslofjord, on, the, other, hand, is, a, rift, valley, and, not, glacially, formed, the, indigenous, m, ori, people, of, new, zealand, see, a, fjord, as, a, kind, of, sea, m, ori, tai, that, runs, by, a, bluff, matapari, altogether, tai, matapari, bluff, sea, the, term, fjord, is, sometimes, applied, to, steep, sided, inlets, which, were, not, created, by, glaciers, most, such, inlets, are, drowned, river, canyons, or, rias, examples, include, some, norwegian, freshwater, lakes, that, have, formed, in, long, glacially, carved, valleys, with, sill, thresholds, ice, front, deltas, or, terminal, moraines, blocking, the, outlet, follow, the, norwegian, naming, convention, they, are, frequently, named, fjords, ice, front, deltas, developed, when, the, ice, front, was, relatively, stable, for, long, time, during, the, melting, of, the, ice, shield, the, resulting, landform, is, an, isthmus, between, the, lake, and, the, saltwater, fjord, in, norwegian, called, eid, as, in, placename, eidfjord, or, nordfjordeid, the, post, glacial, rebound, changed, these, deltas, into, terraces, up, to, the, level, of, the, original, sea, level, in, eidfjord, eio, has, dug, through, the, original, delta, and, left, a, 110, m, 360, ft, terrace, while, lake, is, only, 19, m, 62, ft, above, sea, level, such, deposits, are, valuable, sources, of, high, quality, building, materials, sand, and, gravel, for, houses, and, infrastructure, eidfjord, village, sits, on, the, eid, or, isthmus, between, eidfjordvatnet, lake, and, eidfjorden, branch, of, hardangerfjord, nordfjordeid, is, the, isthmus, with, a, village, between, hornindalsvatnet, lake, and, nordfjord, such, lakes, are, also, denoted, fjord, valley, lakes, by, geologists, one, of, norway, s, largest, is, tyrifjorden, at, 63, m, 207, ft, above, sea, level, and, an, average, depth, at, 97, m, 318, ft, most, of, the, lake, is, under, sea, level, norway, s, largest, lake, mj, sa, is, also, referred, to, as, the, fjord, by, locals, another, example, is, the, freshwater, fjord, movatnet, mo, lake, that, until, 1743, was, separated, from, romarheimsfjorden, by, an, isthmus, and, connected, by, a, short, river, during, a, flood, in, november, 1743, the, river, bed, eroded, and, sea, water, could, flow, into, the, lake, at, high, tide, eventually, movatnet, became, a, saltwater, fjord, and, renamed, mofjorden, mofjorden, like, fjords, freshwater, lakes, are, often, deep, for, instance, hornindalsvatnet, is, at, least, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, deep, and, water, takes, an, average, of, 16, years, to, flow, through, the, lake, such, lakes, created, by, glacial, action, are, also, called, fjord, lakes, or, moraine, dammed, lakes, some, of, these, lakes, were, salt, after, the, ice, age, but, later, cut, off, from, the, ocean, during, the, post, glacial, rebound, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, eastern, norway, was, about, 200, m, 660, ft, lower, the, marine, limit, when, the, ice, cap, receded, and, allowed, the, ocean, to, fill, valleys, and, lowlands, and, lakes, like, mj, sa, and, tyrifjorden, were, part, of, the, ocean, while, drammen, valley, was, a, narrow, fjord, at, the, time, of, the, vikings, drammensfjord, was, still, four, or, five, m, 13, or, 16, ft, higher, than, today, and, reached, the, town, of, hokksund, while, parts, of, what, is, now, the, city, of, drammen, was, under, water, after, the, ice, age, the, ocean, was, about, 150, m, 490, ft, at, notodden, the, ocean, stretched, like, a, fjord, through, heddalsvatnet, all, the, way, to, hjartdal, post, glacial, rebound, eventually, separated, heddalsvatnet, from, the, ocean, and, turned, it, into, a, freshwater, lake, in, neolithic, times, heddalsvatnet, was, still, a, saltwater, fjord, connected, to, the, ocean, and, was, cut, off, from, the, ocean, around, 1500, bc, some, freshwater, fjords, such, as, slidrefjord, are, above, the, marine, limit, like, freshwater, fjords, the, continuation, of, fjords, on, land, are, in, the, same, way, denoted, as, fjord, valleys, for, instance, fl, msdal, fl, m, valley, and, m, b, dalen,
