time, is, the, continued, sequence, of, existence, and, events, that, occurs, in, an, apparently, irreversible, succession, from, the, past, through, the, present, and, into, the, future, it, is, a, component, quantity, of, various, measurements, used, to, sequence, events, to, compare, the, duration, of, events, or, the, intervals, between, them, and, to, quantify, rates, of, change, of, quantities, in, material, reality, or, in, the, conscious, experience, time, is, often, referred, to, as, a, fourth, dimension, along, with, three, spatial, dimensions, time, is, one, of, the, seven, fundamental, physical, quantities, in, both, the, international, system, of, units, si, and, international, system, of, quantities, the, si, base, unit, of, time, is, the, second, which, is, defined, by, measuring, the, electronic, transition, frequency, of, caesium, atoms, general, relativity, is, the, primary, framework, for, understanding, how, spacetime, works, through, advances, in, both, theoretical, and, experimental, investigations, of, spacetime, it, has, been, shown, that, time, can, be, distorted, and, dilated, particularly, at, the, edges, of, black, holes, throughout, history, time, has, been, an, important, subject, of, study, in, religion, philosophy, and, science, temporal, measurement, has, occupied, scientists, and, technologists, and, has, been, a, prime, motivation, in, navigation, and, astronomy, time, is, also, of, significant, social, importance, having, economic, value, time, is, money, as, well, as, personal, value, due, to, an, awareness, of, the, limited, time, in, each, day, and, in, human, life, spans, the, concept, of, time, can, be, complex, multiple, notions, exist, and, defining, time, in, a, manner, applicable, to, all, fields, without, circularity, has, consistently, eluded, scholars, nevertheless, diverse, fields, such, as, business, industry, sports, the, sciences, and, the, performing, arts, all, incorporate, some, notion, of, time, into, their, respective, measuring, systems, traditional, definitions, of, time, involved, the, observation, of, periodic, motion, such, as, the, apparent, motion, of, the, sun, across, the, sky, the, phases, of, the, moon, and, the, passage, of, a, free, swinging, pendulum, more, modern, systems, include, the, global, positioning, system, other, satellite, systems, coordinated, universal, time, and, mean, solar, time, although, these, systems, differ, from, one, another, with, careful, measurements, they, can, be, synchronized, in, physics, time, is, a, fundamental, concept, to, define, other, quantities, such, as, velocity, to, avoid, a, circular, definition, time, in, physics, is, operationally, defined, as, what, a, clock, reads, specifically, a, count, of, repeating, events, such, as, the, si, second, although, this, aids, in, practical, measurements, it, does, not, address, the, essence, of, time, physicists, developed, the, concept, of, the, spacetime, continuum, where, events, are, assigned, four, coordinates, three, for, space, and, one, for, time, events, like, particle, collisions, supernovas, or, rocket, launches, have, coordinates, that, may, vary, for, different, observers, making, concepts, like, now, and, here, relative, in, general, relativity, these, coordinates, do, not, directly, correspond, to, the, causal, structure, of, events, instead, the, spacetime, interval, is, calculated, and, classified, as, either, space, like, or, time, like, depending, on, whether, an, observer, exists, that, would, say, the, events, are, separated, by, space, or, by, time, since, the, time, required, for, light, to, travel, a, specific, distance, is, the, same, for, all, observers, a, fact, first, publicly, demonstrated, by, the, michelson, morley, experiment, all, observers, will, consistently, agree, on, this, definition, of, time, as, a, causal, relation, general, relativity, does, not, address, the, nature, of, time, for, extremely, small, intervals, where, quantum, mechanics, holds, in, quantum, mechanics, time, is, treated, as, a, universal, and, absolute, parameter, differing, from, general, relativity, s, notion, of, independent, clocks, the, problem, of, time, consists, of, reconciling, these, two, theories, as, of, 2024, there, is, no, generally, accepted, theory, of, quantum, general, relativity, generally, speaking, methods, of, temporal, measurement, or, chronometry, take, two, distinct, forms, the, calendar, a, mathematical, tool, for, organising, intervals, of, time, and, the, clock, a, physical, mechanism, that, counts, the, passage, of, time, in, day, to, day, life, the, clock, is, consulted, for, periods, less, than, a, day, whereas, the, calendar, is, consulted, for, periods, longer, than, a, day, increasingly, personal, electronic, devices, display, both, calendars, and, clocks, simultaneously, the, number, as, on, a, clock, dial, or, calendar, that, marks, the, occurrence, of, a, specified, event, as, to, hour, or, date, is, obtained, by, counting, from, a, fiducial, epoch, a, central, reference, point, artifacts, from, the, paleolithic, suggest, that, the, moon, was, used, to, reckon, time, as, early, as, 6, 000, years, ago, lunar, calendars, were, among, the, first, to, appear, with, years, of, either, 12, or, 13, lunar, months, either, 354, or, 384, days, without, intercalation, to, add, days, or, months, to, some, years, seasons, quickly, drift, in, a, calendar, based, solely, on, twelve, lunar, months, lunisolar, calendars, have, a, thirteenth, month, added, to, some, years, to, make, up, for, the, difference, between, a, full, year, now, known, to, be, about, 365, 24, days, and, a, year, of, just, twelve, lunar, months, the, numbers, twelve, and, thirteen, came, to, feature, prominently, in, many, cultures, at, least, partly, due, to, this, relationship, of, months, to, years, other, early, forms, of, calendars, originated, in, mesoamerica, particularly, in, ancient, mayan, civilization, these, calendars, were, religiously, and, astronomically, based, with, 18, months, in, a, year, and, 20, days, in, a, month, plus, five, epagomenal, days, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, reforms, of, julius, caesar, in, 45, bc, put, the, roman, world, on, a, solar, calendar, this, julian, calendar, was, faulty, in, that, its, intercalation, still, allowed, the, astronomical, solstices, and, equinoxes, to, advance, against, it, by, about, 11, minutes, per, year, pope, gregory, xiii, introduced, a, correction, in, 1582, the, gregorian, calendar, was, only, slowly, adopted, by, different, nations, over, a, period, of, centuries, but, it, is, now, by, far, the, most, commonly, used, calendar, around, the, world, during, the, french, revolution, a, new, clock, and, calendar, were, invented, as, part, of, the, dechristianization, of, france, and, to, create, a, more, rational, system, in, order, to, replace, the, gregorian, calendar, the, french, republican, calendar, s, days, consisted, of, ten, hours, of, a, hundred, minutes, of, a, hundred, seconds, which, marked, a, deviation, from, the, base, 12, duodecimal, system, used, in, many, other, devices, by, many, cultures, the, system, was, abolished, in, 1806, a, large, variety, of, devices, have, been, invented, to, measure, time, the, study, of, these, devices, is, called, horology, an, egyptian, device, that, dates, to, c, 1500, bc, similar, in, shape, to, a, bent, t, square, measured, the, passage, of, time, from, the, shadow, cast, by, its, crossbar, on, a, nonlinear, rule, the, t, was, oriented, eastward, in, the, mornings, at, noon, the, device, was, turned, around, so, that, it, could, cast, its, shadow, in, the, evening, direction, a, sundial, uses, a, gnomon, to, cast, a, shadow, on, a, set, of, markings, calibrated, to, the, hour, the, position, of, the, shadow, marks, the, hour, in, local, time, the, idea, to, separate, the, day, into, smaller, parts, is, credited, to, egyptians, because, of, their, sundials, which, operated, on, a, duodecimal, system, the, importance, of, the, number, 12, is, due, to, the, number, of, lunar, cycles, in, a, year, and, the, number, of, stars, used, to, count, the, passage, of, night, the, most, precise, timekeeping, device, of, the, ancient, world, was, the, water, clock, or, clepsydra, one, of, which, was, found, in, the, tomb, of, egyptian, pharaoh, amenhotep, i, they, could, be, used, to, measure, the, hours, even, at, night, but, required, manual, upkeep, to, replenish, the, flow, of, water, the, ancient, greeks, and, the, people, from, chaldea, southeastern, mesopotamia, regularly, maintained, timekeeping, records, as, an, essential, part, of, their, astronomical, observations, arab, inventors, and, engineers, in, particular, made, improvements, on, the, use, of, water, clocks, up, to, the, middle, ages, in, the, 11th, century, chinese, inventors, and, engineers, invented, the, first, mechanical, clocks, driven, by, an, escapement, mechanism, the, hourglass, uses, the, flow, of, sand, to, measure, the, flow, of, time, they, were, used, in, navigation, ferdinand, magellan, used, 18, glasses, on, each, ship, for, his, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, 1522, incense, sticks, and, candles, were, and, are, commonly, used, to, measure, time, in, temples, and, churches, across, the, globe, water, clocks, and, later, mechanical, clocks, were, used, to, mark, the, events, of, the, abbeys, and, monasteries, of, the, middle, ages, richard, of, wallingford, 1292, 1336, abbot, of, st, alban, s, abbey, famously, built, a, mechanical, clock, as, an, astronomical, orrery, about, 1330, great, advances, in, accurate, time, keeping, were, made, by, galileo, galilei, and, especially, christiaan, huygens, with, the, invention, of, pendulum, driven, clocks, along, with, the, invention, of, the, minute, hand, by, jost, burgi, the, english, word, clock, probably, comes, from, the, middle, dutch, word, klocke, which, in, turn, derives, from, the, medieval, latin, word, clocca, which, ultimately, derives, from, celtic, and, is, cognate, with, french, latin, and, german, words, that, mean, bell, the, passage, of, the, hours, at, sea, was, marked, by, bells, and, denoted, the, time, see, ship, s, bell, the, hours, were, marked, by, bells, in, abbeys, as, well, as, at, sea, clocks, can, range, from, watches, to, more, exotic, varieties, such, as, the, clock, of, the, long, now, they, can, be, driven, by, a, variety, of, means, including, gravity, springs, and, various, forms, of, electrical, power, and, regulated, by, a, variety, of, means, such, as, a, pendulum, alarm, clocks, first, appeared, in, ancient, greece, around, 250, bc, with, a, water, clock, that, would, set, off, a, whistle, this, idea, was, later, mechanized, by, levi, hutchins, and, seth, e, thomas, a, chronometer, is, a, portable, timekeeper, that, meets, certain, precision, standards, initially, the, term, was, used, to, refer, to, the, marine, chronometer, a, timepiece, used, to, determine, longitude, by, means, of, celestial, navigation, a, precision, first, achieved, by, john, harrison, more, recently, the, term, has, also, been, applied, to, the, chronometer, watch, a, watch, that, meets, precision, standards, set, by, the, swiss, agency, cosc, the, most, accurate, timekeeping, devices, are, atomic, clocks, which, are, accurate, to, seconds, in, many, millions, of, years, and, are, used, to, calibrate, other, clocks, and, timekeeping, instruments, atomic, clocks, use, the, frequency, of, electronic, transitions, in, certain, atoms, to, measure, the, second, one, of, the, atoms, used, is, caesium, most, modern, atomic, clocks, probe, caesium, with, microwaves, to, determine, the, frequency, of, these, electron, vibrations, since, 1967, the, international, system, of, measurements, bases, its, unit, of, time, the, second, on, the, properties, of, caesium, atoms, si, defines, the, second, as, 9, 192, 631, 770, cycles, of, the, radiation, that, corresponds, to, the, transition, between, two, electron, spin, energy, levels, of, the, ground, state, of, the, 133, cs, atom, today, the, global, positioning, system, in, coordination, with, the, network, time, protocol, can, be, used, to, synchronize, timekeeping, systems, across, the, globe, in, medieval, philosophical, writings, the, atom, was, a, unit, of, time, referred, to, as, the, smallest, possible, division, of, time, the, earliest, known, occurrence, in, english, is, in, byrhtferth, s, enchiridion, a, science, text, of, 1010, 1012, where, it, was, defined, as, 1, 564, of, a, momentum, 1, 1, 2, minutes, and, thus, equal, to, 15, 94, of, a, second, it, was, used, in, the, computus, the, process, of, calculating, the, date, of, easter, as, of, may, 2010, the, smallest, time, interval, uncertainty, in, direct, measurements, is, on, the, order, of, 12, attoseconds, 1, 2, 10, 17, seconds, about, 3, 7, 10, 26, planck, times, the, second, s, is, the, si, base, unit, a, minute, min, is, 60, seconds, in, length, or, rarely, 59, or, 61, seconds, when, leap, seconds, are, employed, and, an, hour, is, 60, minutes, or, 3600, seconds, in, length, a, day, is, usually, 24, hours, or, 86, 400, seconds, in, length, however, the, duration, of, a, calendar, day, can, vary, due, to, daylight, saving, time, and, leap, seconds, a, time, standard, is, a, specification, for, measuring, time, assigning, a, number, or, calendar, date, to, an, instant, point, in, time, quantifying, the, duration, of, a, time, interval, and, establishing, a, chronology, ordering, of, events, in, modern, times, several, time, specifications, have, been, officially, recognized, as, standards, where, formerly, they, were, matters, of, custom, and, practice, the, invention, in, 1955, of, the, caesium, atomic, clock, has, led, to, the, replacement, of, older, and, purely, astronomical, time, standards, such, as, sidereal, time, and, ephemeris, time, for, most, practical, purposes, by, newer, time, standards, based, wholly, or, partly, on, atomic, time, using, the, si, second, international, atomic, time, tai, is, the, primary, international, time, standard, from, which, other, time, standards, are, calculated, universal, time, ut1, is, mean, solar, time, at, 0, longitude, computed, from, astronomical, observations, it, varies, from, tai, because, of, the, irregularities, in, earth, s, rotation, coordinated, universal, time, utc, is, an, atomic, time, scale, designed, to, approximate, universal, time, utc, differs, from, tai, by, an, integral, number, of, seconds, utc, is, kept, within, 0, 9, second, of, ut1, by, the, introduction, of, one, second, steps, to, utc, the, leap, second, the, global, positioning, system, broadcasts, a, very, precise, time, signal, based, on, utc, time, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, split, into, a, number, of, time, zones, standard, time, or, civil, time, in, a, time, zone, deviates, a, fixed, round, amount, usually, a, whole, number, of, hours, from, some, form, of, universal, time, usually, utc, most, time, zones, are, exactly, one, hour, apart, and, by, convention, compute, their, local, time, as, an, offset, from, utc, for, example, time, zones, at, sea, are, based, on, utc, in, many, locations, but, not, at, sea, these, offsets, vary, twice, yearly, due, to, daylight, saving, time, transitions, some, other, time, standards, are, used, mainly, for, scientific, work, terrestrial, time, is, a, theoretical, ideal, scale, realized, by, tai, geocentric, coordinate, time, and, barycentric, coordinate, time, are, scales, defined, as, coordinate, times, in, the, context, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, barycentric, dynamical, time, is, an, older, relativistic, scale, that, is, still, in, use, many, ancient, cultures, particularly, in, the, east, had, a, cyclical, view, of, time, in, these, traditions, time, was, often, seen, as, a, recurring, pattern, of, ages, or, cycles, where, events, and, phenomena, repeated, themselves, in, a, predictable, manner, one, of, the, most, famous, examples, of, this, concept, is, found, in, hindu, philosophy, where, time, is, depicted, as, a, wheel, called, the, kalachakra, or, wheel, of, time, according, to, this, belief, the, universe, undergoes, endless, cycles, of, creation, preservation, and, destruction, similarly, in, other, ancient, cultures, such, as, those, of, the, mayans, aztecs, and, chinese, there, were, also, beliefs, in, cyclical, time, often, associated, with, astronomical, observations, and, calendars, these, cultures, developed, complex, systems, to, track, time, seasons, and, celestial, movements, reflecting, their, understanding, of, cyclical, patterns, in, nature, and, the, universe, the, cyclical, view, of, time, contrasts, with, the, linear, concept, of, time, more, common, in, western, thought, where, time, is, seen, as, progressing, in, a, straight, line, from, past, to, future, without, repetition, in, general, the, islamic, and, judeo, christian, world, view, regards, time, as, linear, and, directional, beginning, with, the, act, of, creation, by, god, the, traditional, christian, view, sees, time, ending, teleologically, with, the, eschatological, end, of, the, present, order, of, things, the, end, time, in, the, old, testament, book, ecclesiastes, traditionally, ascribed, to, solomon, 970, 928, bc, time, as, the, hebrew, word, iddan, age, as, in, ice, age, z, man, time, is, often, translated, is, a, medium, for, the, passage, of, predestined, events, another, word, zam, n, meant, time, fit, for, an, event, and, is, used, as, the, modern, arabic, persian, and, hebrew, equivalent, to, the, english, word, time, the, greek, language, denotes, two, distinct, principles, chronos, and, kairos, the, former, refers, to, numeric, or, chronological, time, the, latter, literally, the, right, or, opportune, moment, relates, specifically, to, metaphysical, or, divine, time, in, theology, kairos, is, qualitative, as, opposed, to, quantitative, in, greek, mythology, chronos, ancient, greek, is, identified, as, the, personification, of, time, his, name, in, greek, means, time, and, is, alternatively, spelled, chronus, latin, spelling, or, khronos, chronos, is, usually, portrayed, as, an, old, wise, man, with, a, long, gray, beard, such, as, father, time, some, english, words, whose, etymological, root, is, khronos, chronos, include, chronology, chronometer, chronic, anachronism, synchronise, and, chronicle, rabbis, sometimes, saw, time, like, an, accordion, that, was, expanded, and, collapsed, at, will, according, to, kabbalists, time, is, a, paradox, and, an, illusion, according, to, advaita, vedanta, time, is, integral, to, the, phenomenal, world, which, lacks, independent, reality, time, and, the, phenomenal, world, are, products, of, maya, influenced, by, our, senses, concepts, and, imaginations, the, phenomenal, world, including, time, is, seen, as, impermanent, and, characterized, by, plurality, suffering, conflict, and, division, since, phenomenal, existence, is, dominated, by, temporality, kala, everything, within, time, is, subject, to, change, and, decay, overcoming, pain, and, death, requires, knowledge, that, transcends, temporal, existence, and, reveals, its, eternal, foundation, two, contrasting, viewpoints, on, time, divide, prominent, philosophers, one, view, is, that, time, is, part, of, the, fundamental, structure, of, the, universe, a, dimension, independent, of, events, in, which, events, occur, in, sequence, isaac, newton, subscribed, to, this, realist, view, and, hence, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, newtonian, time, the, opposing, view, is, that, time, does, not, refer, to, any, kind, of, container, that, events, and, objects, move, through, nor, to, any, entity, that, flows, but, that, it, is, instead, part, of, a, fundamental, intellectual, structure, together, with, space, and, number, within, which, humans, sequence, and, compare, events, this, second, view, in, the, tradition, of, gottfried, leibniz, and, immanuel, kant, holds, that, time, is, neither, an, event, nor, a, thing, and, thus, is, not, itself, measurable, nor, can, it, be, travelled, furthermore, it, may, be, that, there, is, a, subjective, component, to, time, but, whether, or, not, time, itself, is, felt, as, a, sensation, or, is, a, judgment, is, a, matter, of, debate, in, philosophy, time, was, questioned, throughout, the, centuries, what, time, is, and, if, it, is, real, or, not, ancient, greek, philosophers, asked, if, time, was, linear, or, cyclical, and, if, time, was, endless, or, finite, these, philosophers, had, different, ways, of, explaining, time, for, instance, ancient, indian, philosophers, had, something, called, the, wheel, of, time, it, is, believed, that, there, was, repeating, ages, over, the, lifespan, of, the, universe, this, led, to, beliefs, like, cycles, of, rebirth, and, reincarnation, the, greek, philosophers, believe, that, the, universe, was, infinite, and, was, an, illusion, to, humans, plato, believed, that, time, was, made, by, the, creator, at, the, same, instant, as, the, heavens, he, also, says, that, time, is, a, period, of, motion, of, the, heavenly, bodies, aristotle, believed, that, time, correlated, to, movement, that, time, did, not, exist, on, its, own, but, was, relative, to, motion, of, objects, he, also, believed, that, time, was, related, to, the, motion, of, celestial, bodies, the, reason, that, humans, can, tell, time, was, because, of, orbital, periods, and, therefore, there, was, a, duration, on, time, the, vedas, the, earliest, texts, on, indian, philosophy, and, hindu, philosophy, dating, to, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, describe, ancient, hindu, cosmology, in, which, the, universe, goes, through, repeated, cycles, of, creation, destruction, and, rebirth, with, each, cycle, lasting, 4, 320, million, years, ancient, greek, philosophers, including, parmenides, and, heraclitus, wrote, essays, on, the, nature, of, time, plato, in, the, timaeus, identified, time, with, the, period, of, motion, of, the, heavenly, bodies, aristotle, in, book, iv, of, his, physica, defined, time, as, number, of, movement, in, respect, of, the, before, and, after, in, book, 11, of, his, confessions, st, augustine, of, hippo, ruminates, on, the, nature, of, time, asking, what, then, is, time, if, no, one, asks, me, i, know, if, i, wish, to, explain, it, to, one, that, asketh, i, know, not, he, begins, to, define, time, by, what, it, is, not, rather, than, what, it, is, an, approach, similar, to, that, taken, in, other, negative, definitions, however, augustine, ends, up, calling, time, a, distention, of, the, mind, confessions, 11, 26, by, which, we, simultaneously, grasp, the, past, in, memory, the, present, by, attention, and, the, future, by, expectation, isaac, newton, believed, in, absolute, space, and, absolute, time, leibniz, believed, that, time, and, space, are, relational, the, differences, between, leibniz, s, and, newton, s, interpretations, came, to, a, head, in, the, famous, leibniz, clarke, correspondence, philosophers, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, questioned, if, time, was, real, and, absolute, or, if, it, was, an, intellectual, concept, that, humans, use, to, understand, and, sequence, events, these, questions, lead, to, realism, vs, anti, realism, the, realists, believed, that, time, is, a, fundamental, part, of, the, universe, and, be, perceived, by, events, happening, in, a, sequence, in, a, dimension, isaac, newton, said, that, we, are, merely, occupying, time, he, also, says, that, humans, can, only, understand, relative, time, relative, time, is, a, measurement, of, objects, in, motion, the, anti, realists, believed, that, time, is, merely, a, convenient, intellectual, concept, for, humans, to, understand, events, this, means, that, time, was, useless, unless, there, were, objects, that, it, could, interact, with, this, was, called, relational, time, ren, descartes, john, locke, and, david, hume, said, that, one, s, mind, needs, to, acknowledge, time, in, order, to, understand, what, time, is, immanuel, kant, believed, that, we, can, not, know, what, something, is, unless, we, experience, it, first, hand, time, is, not, an, empirical, concept, for, neither, co, existence, nor, succession, would, be, perceived, by, us, if, the, representation, of, time, did, not, exist, as, a, foundation, a, priori, without, this, presupposition, we, could, not, represent, to, ourselves, that, things, exist, together, at, one, and, the, same, time, or, at, different, times, that, is, contemporaneously, or, in, succession, immanuel, kant, critique, of, pure, reason, 1781, trans, vasilis, politis, london, dent, 1991, p, 54, immanuel, kant, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, described, time, as, an, a, priori, intuition, that, allows, us, together, with, the, other, a, priori, intuition, space, to, comprehend, sense, experience, with, kant, neither, space, nor, time, are, conceived, as, substances, but, rather, both, are, elements, of, a, systematic, mental, framework, that, necessarily, structures, the, experiences, of, any, rational, agent, or, observing, subject, kant, thought, of, time, as, a, fundamental, part, of, an, abstract, conceptual, framework, together, with, space, and, number, within, which, we, sequence, events, quantify, their, duration, and, compare, the, motions, of, objects, in, this, view, time, does, not, refer, to, any, kind, of, entity, that, flows, that, objects, move, through, or, that, is, a, container, for, events, spatial, measurements, are, used, to, quantify, the, extent, of, and, distances, between, objects, and, temporal, measurements, are, used, to, quantify, the, durations, of, and, between, events, time, was, designated, by, kant, as, the, purest, possible, schema, of, a, pure, concept, or, category, henri, bergson, believed, that, time, was, neither, a, real, homogeneous, medium, nor, a, mental, construct, but, possesses, what, he, referred, to, as, duration, duration, in, bergson, s, view, was, creativity, and, memory, as, an, essential, component, of, reality, according, to, martin, heidegger, we, do, not, exist, inside, time, we, are, time, hence, the, relationship, to, the, past, is, a, present, awareness, of, having, been, which, allows, the, past, to, exist, in, the, present, the, relationship, to, the, future, is, the, state, of, anticipating, a, potential, possibility, task, or, engagement, it, is, related, to, the, human, propensity, for, caring, and, being, concerned, which, causes, being, ahead, of, oneself, when, thinking, of, a, pending, occurrence, therefore, this, concern, for, a, potential, occurrence, also, allows, the, future, to, exist, in, the, present, the, present, becomes, an, experience, which, is, qualitative, instead, of, quantitative, heidegger, seems, to, think, this, is, the, way, that, a, linear, relationship, with, time, or, temporal, existence, is, broken, or, transcended, we, are, not, stuck, in, sequential, time, we, are, able, to, remember, the, past, and, project, into, the, future, we, have, a, kind, of, random, access, to, our, representation, of, temporal, existence, we, can, in, our, thoughts, step, out, of, ecstasis, sequential, time, modern, era, philosophers, asked, is, time, real, or, unreal, is, time, happening, all, at, once, or, a, duration, is, time, tensed, or, tenseless, and, is, there, a, future, to, be, there, is, a, theory, called, the, tenseless, or, b, theory, this, theory, says, that, any, tensed, terminology, can, be, replaced, with, tenseless, terminology, for, example, we, will, win, the, game, can, be, replaced, with, we, do, win, the, game, taking, out, the, future, tense, on, the, other, hand, there, is, a, theory, called, the, tense, or, a, theory, this, theory, says, that, our, language, has, tense, verbs, for, a, reason, and, that, the, future, can, not, be, determined, there, is, also, something, called, imaginary, time, this, was, from, stephen, hawking, who, said, that, space, and, imaginary, time, are, finite, but, have, no, boundaries, imaginary, time, is, not, real, or, unreal, it, is, something, that, is, hard, to, visualize, philosophers, can, agree, that, physical, time, exists, outside, of, the, human, mind, and, is, objective, and, psychological, time, is, mind, dependent, and, subjective, in, 5th, century, bc, greece, antiphon, the, sophist, in, a, fragment, preserved, from, his, chief, work, on, truth, held, that, time, is, not, a, reality, hypostasis, but, a, concept, no, ma, or, a, measure, metron, parmenides, went, further, maintaining, that, time, motion, and, change, were, illusions, leading, to, the, paradoxes, of, his, follower, zeno, time, as, an, illusion, is, also, a, common, theme, in, buddhist, thought, j, m, e, mctaggart, s, 1908, the, unreality, of, time, argues, that, since, every, event, has, the, characteristic, of, being, both, present, and, not, present, i, e, future, or, past, that, time, is, a, self, contradictory, idea, see, also, the, flow, of, time, these, arguments, often, center, on, what, it, means, for, something, to, be, unreal, modern, physicists, generally, believe, that, time, is, as, real, as, space, though, others, such, as, julian, barbour, argue, quantum, equations, of, the, universe, take, their, true, form, when, expressed, in, the, timeless, realm, containing, every, possible, now, or, momentary, configuration, of, the, universe, a, modern, philosophical, theory, called, presentism, views, the, past, and, the, future, as, human, mind, interpretations, of, movement, instead, of, real, parts, of, time, or, dimensions, which, coexist, with, the, present, this, theory, rejects, the, existence, of, all, direct, interaction, with, the, past, or, the, future, holding, only, the, present, as, tangible, this, is, one, of, the, philosophical, arguments, against, time, travel, this, contrasts, with, eternalism, all, time, present, past, and, future, is, real, and, the, growing, block, theory, the, present, and, the, past, are, real, but, the, future, is, not, until, einstein, s, reinterpretation, of, the, physical, concepts, associated, with, time, and, space, in, 1907, time, was, considered, to, be, the, same, everywhere, in, the, universe, with, all, observers, measuring, the, same, time, interval, for, any, event, non, relativistic, classical, mechanics, is, based, on, this, newtonian, idea, of, time, einstein, in, his, special, theory, of, relativity, postulated, the, constancy, and, finiteness, of, the, speed, of, light, for, all, observers, he, showed, that, this, postulate, together, with, a, reasonable, definition, for, what, it, means, for, two, events, to, be, simultaneous, requires, that, distances, appear, compressed, and, time, intervals, appear, lengthened, for, events, associated, with, objects, in, motion, relative, to, an, inertial, observer, the, theory, of, special, relativity, finds, a, convenient, formulation, in, minkowski, spacetime, a, mathematical, structure, that, combines, three, dimensions, of, space, with, a, single, dimension, of, time, in, this, formalism, distances, in, space, can, be, measured, by, how, long, light, takes, to, travel, that, distance, e, g, a, light, year, is, a, measure, of, distance, and, a, meter, is, now, defined, in, terms, of, how, far, light, travels, in, a, certain, amount, of, time, two, events, in, minkowski, spacetime, are, separated, by, an, invariant, interval, which, can, be, either, space, like, light, like, or, time, like, events, that, have, a, time, like, separation, cannot, be, simultaneous, in, any, frame, of, reference, there, must, be, a, temporal, component, and, possibly, a, spatial, one, to, their, separation, events, that, have, a, space, like, separation, will, be, simultaneous, in, some, frame, of, reference, and, there, is, no, frame, of, reference, in, which, they, do, not, have, a, spatial, separation, different, observers, may, calculate, different, distances, and, different, time, intervals, between, two, events, but, the, invariant, interval, between, the, events, is, independent, of, the, observer, and, his, or, her, velocity, unlike, space, where, an, object, can, travel, in, the, opposite, directions, and, in, 3, dimensions, time, appears, to, have, only, one, dimension, and, only, one, direction, the, past, lies, behind, fixed, and, immutable, while, the, future, lies, ahead, and, is, not, necessarily, fixed, yet, most, laws, of, physics, allow, any, process, to, proceed, both, forward, and, in, reverse, there, are, only, a, few, physical, phenomena, that, violate, the, reversibility, of, time, this, time, directionality, is, known, as, the, arrow, of, time, acknowledged, examples, of, the, arrow, of, time, are, the, relationship, s, between, these, different, arrows, of, time, is, a, hotly, debated, topic, in, theoretical, physics, in, non, relativistic, classical, mechanics, newton, s, concept, of, relative, apparent, and, common, time, can, be, used, in, the, formulation, of, a, prescription, for, the, synchronization, of, clocks, events, seen, by, two, different, observers, in, motion, relative, to, each, other, produce, a, mathematical, concept, of, time, that, works, sufficiently, well, for, describing, the, everyday, phenomena, of, most, people, s, experience, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, physicists, encountered, problems, with, the, classical, understanding, of, time, in, connection, with, the, behavior, of, electricity, and, magnetism, einstein, resolved, these, problems, by, invoking, a, method, of, synchronizing, clocks, using, the, constant, finite, speed, of, light, as, the, maximum, signal, velocity, this, led, directly, to, the, conclusion, that, observers, in, motion, relative, to, one, another, measure, different, elapsed, times, for, the, same, event, time, has, historically, been, closely, related, with, space, the, two, together, merging, into, spacetime, in, einstein, s, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, according, to, these, theories, the, concept, of, time, depends, on, the, spatial, reference, frame, of, the, observer, and, the, human, perception, as, well, as, the, measurement, by, instruments, such, as, clocks, are, different, for, observers, in, relative, motion, for, example, if, a, spaceship, carrying, a, clock, flies, through, space, at, very, nearly, the, speed, of, light, its, crew, does, not, notice, a, change, in, the, speed, of, time, on, board, their, vessel, because, everything, traveling, at, the, same, speed, slows, down, at, the, same, rate, including, the, clock, the, crew, s, thought, processes, and, the, functions, of, their, bodies, however, to, a, stationary, observer, watching, the, spaceship, fly, by, the, spaceship, appears, flattened, in, the, direction, it, is, traveling, and, the, clock, on, board, the, spaceship, appears, to, move, very, slowly, on, the, other, hand, the, crew, on, board, the, spaceship, also, perceives, the, observer, as, slowed, down, and, flattened, along, the, spaceship, s, direction, of, travel, because, both, are, moving, at, very, nearly, the, speed, of, light, relative, to, each, other, because, the, outside, universe, appears, flattened, to, the, spaceship, the, crew, perceives, themselves, as, quickly, traveling, between, regions, of, space, that, to, the, stationary, observer, are, many, light, years, apart, this, is, reconciled, by, the, fact, that, the, crew, s, perception, of, time, is, different, from, the, stationary, observer, s, what, seems, like, seconds, to, the, crew, might, be, hundreds, of, years, to, the, stationary, observer, in, either, case, however, causality, remains, unchanged, the, past, is, the, set, of, events, that, can, send, light, signals, to, an, entity, and, the, future, is, the, set, of, events, to, which, an, entity, can, send, light, signals, einstein, showed, in, his, thought, experiments, that, people, travelling, at, different, speeds, while, agreeing, on, cause, and, effect, measure, different, time, separations, between, events, and, can, even, observe, different, chronological, orderings, between, non, causally, related, events, though, these, effects, are, typically, minute, in, the, human, experience, the, effect, becomes, much, more, pronounced, for, objects, moving, at, speeds, approaching, the, speed, of, light, subatomic, particles, exist, for, a, well, known, average, fraction, of, a, second, in, a, lab, relatively, at, rest, but, when, travelling, close, to, the, speed, of, light, they, are, measured, to, travel, farther, and, exist, for, much, longer, than, when, at, rest, according, to, the, special, theory, of, relativity, in, the, high, speed, particle, s, frame, of, reference, it, exists, on, the, average, for, a, standard, amount, of, time, known, as, its, mean, lifetime, and, the, distance, it, travels, in, that, time, is, zero, because, its, velocity, is, zero, relative, to, a, frame, of, reference, at, rest, time, seems, to, slow, down, for, the, particle, relative, to, the, high, speed, particle, distances, seem, to, shorten, einstein, showed, how, both, temporal, and, spatial, dimensions, can, be, altered, or, warped, by, high, speed, motion, einstein, the, meaning, of, relativity, two, events, taking, place, at, the, points, a, and, b, of, a, system, k, are, simultaneous, if, they, appear, at, the, same, instant, when, observed, from, the, middle, point, m, of, the, interval, ab, time, is, then, defined, as, the, ensemble, of, the, indications, of, similar, clocks, at, rest, relative, to, k, which, register, the, same, simultaneously, einstein, wrote, in, his, book, relativity, that, simultaneity, is, also, relative, i, e, two, events, that, appear, simultaneous, to, an, observer, in, a, particular, inertial, reference, frame, need, not, be, judged, as, simultaneous, by, a, second, observer, in, a, different, inertial, frame, of, reference, the, animations, visualise, the, different, treatments, of, time, in, the, newtonian, and, the, relativistic, descriptions, at, the, heart, of, these, differences, are, the, galilean, and, lorentz, transformations, applicable, in, the, newtonian, and, relativistic, theories, respectively, in, the, figures, the, vertical, direction, indicates, time, the, horizontal, direction, indicates, distance, only, one, spatial, dimension, is, taken, into, account, and, the, thick, dashed, curve, is, the, spacetime, trajectory, world, line, of, the, observer, the, small, dots, indicate, specific, past, and, future, events, in, spacetime, the, slope, of, the, world, line, deviation, from, being, vertical, gives, the, relative, velocity, to, the, observer, in, both, pictures, the, view, of, spacetime, changes, when, the, observer, accelerates, in, the, newtonian, description, these, changes, are, such, that, time, is, absolute, the, movements, of, the, observer, do, not, influence, whether, an, event, occurs, in, the, now, i, e, whether, an, event, passes, the, horizontal, line, through, the, observer, however, in, the, relativistic, description, the, observability, of, events, is, absolute, the, movements, of, the, observer, do, not, influence, whether, an, event, passes, the, light, cone, of, the, observer, notice, that, with, the, change, from, a, newtonian, to, a, relativistic, description, the, concept, of, absolute, time, is, no, longer, applicable, events, move, up, and, down, in, the, figure, depending, on, the, acceleration, of, the, observer, time, quantization, is, a, hypothetical, concept, in, the, modern, established, physical, theories, the, standard, model, of, particles, and, interactions, and, general, relativity, time, is, not, quantized, planck, time, 5, 4, 10, 44, seconds, is, the, unit, of, time, in, the, system, of, natural, units, known, as, planck, units, current, established, physical, theories, are, believed, to, fail, at, this, time, scale, and, many, physicists, expect, that, the, planck, time, might, be, the, smallest, unit, of, time, that, could, ever, be, measured, even, in, principle, tentative, physical, theories, that, describe, this, time, scale, exist, see, for, instance, loop, quantum, gravity, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, entropy, must, increase, over, time, see, entropy, this, can, be, in, either, direction, brian, greene, theorizes, that, according, to, the, equations, the, change, in, entropy, occurs, symmetrically, whether, going, forward, or, backward, in, time, so, entropy, tends, to, increase, in, either, direction, and, our, current, low, entropy, universe, is, a, statistical, aberration, in, a, similar, manner, as, tossing, a, coin, often, enough, that, eventually, heads, will, result, ten, times, in, a, row, however, this, theory, is, not, supported, empirically, in, local, experiment, time, travel, is, the, concept, of, moving, backwards, or, forwards, to, different, points, in, time, in, a, manner, analogous, to, moving, through, space, and, different, from, the, normal, flow, of, time, to, an, earthbound, observer, in, this, view, all, points, in, time, including, future, times, persist, in, some, way, time, travel, has, been, a, plot, device, in, fiction, since, the, 19th, century, travelling, backwards, or, forwards, in, time, has, never, been, verified, as, a, process, and, doing, so, presents, many, theoretical, problems, and, contradictive, logic, which, to, date, have, not, been, overcome, any, technological, device, whether, fictional, or, hypothetical, that, is, used, to, achieve, time, travel, is, known, as, a, time, machine, a, central, problem, with, time, travel, to, the, past, is, the, violation, of, causality, should, an, effect, precede, its, cause, it, would, give, rise, to, the, possibility, of, a, temporal, paradox, some, interpretations, of, time, travel, resolve, this, by, accepting, the, possibility, of, travel, between, branch, points, parallel, realities, or, universes, another, solution, to, the, problem, of, causality, based, temporal, paradoxes, is, that, such, paradoxes, cannot, arise, simply, because, they, have, not, arisen, as, illustrated, in, numerous, works, of, fiction, free, will, either, ceases, to, exist, in, the, past, or, the, outcomes, of, such, decisions, are, predetermined, as, such, it, would, not, be, possible, to, enact, the, grandfather, paradox, because, it, is, a, historical, fact, that, one, s, grandfather, was, not, killed, before, his, child, one, s, parent, was, conceived, this, view, does, not, simply, hold, that, history, is, an, unchangeable, constant, but, that, any, change, made, by, a, hypothetical, future, time, traveller, would, already, have, happened, in, his, or, her, past, resulting, in, the, reality, that, the, traveller, moves, from, more, elaboration, on, this, view, can, be, found, in, the, novikov, self, consistency, principle, the, specious, present, refers, to, the, time, duration, wherein, one, s, perceptions, are, considered, to, be, in, the, present, the, experienced, present, is, said, to, be, specious, in, that, unlike, the, objective, present, it, is, an, interval, and, not, a, durationless, instant, the, term, specious, present, was, first, introduced, by, the, psychologist, e, r, clay, and, later, developed, by, william, james, the, brain, s, judgment, of, time, is, known, to, be, a, highly, distributed, system, including, at, least, the, cerebral, cortex, cerebellum, and, basal, ganglia, as, its, components, one, particular, component, the, suprachiasmatic, nuclei, is, responsible, for, the, circadian, or, daily, rhythm, while, other, cell, clusters, appear, capable, of, shorter, range, ultradian, timekeeping, psychoactive, drugs, can, impair, the, judgment, of, time, stimulants, can, lead, both, humans, and, rats, to, overestimate, time, intervals, while, depressants, can, have, the, opposite, effect, the, level, of, activity, in, the, brain, of, neurotransmitters, such, as, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, may, be, the, reason, for, this, such, chemicals, will, either, excite, or, inhibit, the, firing, of, neurons, in, the, brain, with, a, greater, firing, rate, allowing, the, brain, to, register, the, occurrence, of, more, events, within, a, given, interval, speed, up, time, and, a, decreased, firing, rate, reducing, the, brain, s, capacity, to, distinguish, events, occurring, within, a, given,

not, now, five, and, six, year, olds, can, grasp, the, ideas, of, past, present, and, future, seven, to, ten, year, olds, can, use, clocks, and, calendars, in, addition, to, psychoactive, drugs, judgments, of, time, can, be, altered, by, temporal, illusions, like, the, kappa, effect, age, and, hypnosis, the, sense, of, time, is, impaired, in, some, people, with, neurological, diseases, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, and, attention, deficit, disorder, psychologists, assert, that, time, seems, to, go, faster, with, age, but, the, literature, on, this, age, related, perception, of, time, remains, controversial, those, who, support, this, notion, argue, that, young, people, having, more, excitatory, neurotransmitters, are, able, to, cope, with, faster, external, events, although, time, is, regarded, as, an, abstract, concept, there, is, increasing, evidence, that, time, is, conceptualized, in, the, mind, in, terms, of, space, that, is, instead, of, thinking, about, time, in, a, general, abstract, way, humans, think, about, time, in, a, spatial, way, and, mentally, organize, it, as, such, using, space, to, think, about, time, allows, humans, to, mentally, organize, temporal, events, in, a, specific, way, this, spatial, representation, of, time, is, often, represented, in, the, mind, as, a, mental, time, line, mtl, using, space, to, think, about, time, allows, humans, to, mentally, organize, temporal, order, these, origins, are, shaped, by, many, environmental, factors, for, example, literacy, appears, to, play, a, large, role, in, the, different, types, of, mtls, as, reading, writing, direction, provides, an, everyday, temporal, orientation, that, differs, from, culture, to, culture, in, western, cultures, the, mtl, may, unfold, rightward, with, the, past, on, the, left, and, the, future, on, the, right, since, people, read, and, write, from, left, to, right, western, calendars, also, continue, this, trend, by, placing, the, past, on, the, left, with, the, future, progressing, toward, the, right, conversely, arabic, farsi, urdu, and, israeli, hebrew, speakers, read, from, right, to, left, and, their, mtls, unfold, leftward, past, on, the, right, with, future, on, the, left, and, evidence, suggests, these, speakers, organize, time, events, in, their, minds, like, this, as, well, this, linguistic, evidence, that, abstract, concepts, are, based, in, spatial, concepts, also, reveals, that, the, way, humans, mentally, organize, time, events, varies, across, cultures, that, is, a, certain, specific, mental, organization, system, is, not, universal, so, although, western, cultures, typically, associate, past, events, with, the, left, and, future, events, with, the, right, according, to, a, certain, mtl, this, kind, of, horizontal, egocentric, mtl, is, not, the, spatial, organization, of, all, cultures, although, most, developed, nations, use, an, egocentric, spatial, system, there, is, recent, evidence, that, some, cultures, use, an, allocentric, spatialization, often, based, on, environmental, features, a, study, of, the, indigenous, yupno, people, of, papua, new, guinea, focused, on, the, directional, gestures, used, when, individuals, used, time, related, words, when, speaking, of, the, past, such, as, last, year, or, past, times, individuals, gestured, downhill, where, the, river, of, the, valley, flowed, into, the, ocean, when, speaking, of, the, future, they, gestured, uphill, toward, the, source, of, the, river, this, was, common, regardless, of, which, direction, the, person, faced, revealing, that, the, yupno, people, may, use, an, allocentric, mtl, in, which, time, flows, uphill, a, similar, study, of, the, pormpuraawans, an, aboriginal, group, in, australia, revealed, a, similar, distinction, in, which, when, asked, to, organize, photos, of, a, man, aging, in, order, individuals, consistently, placed, the, youngest, photos, to, the, east, and, the, oldest, photos, to, the, west, regardless, of, which, direction, they, faced, this, directly, clashed, with, an, american, group, that, consistently, organized, the, photos, from, left, to, right, therefore, this, group, also, appears, to, have, an, allocentric, mtl, but, based, on, the, cardinal, directions, instead, of, geographical, features, the, wide, array, of, distinctions, in, the, way, different, groups, think, about, time, leads, to, the, broader, question, that, different, groups, may, also, think, about, other, abstract, concepts, in, different, ways, as, well, such, as, causality, and, number, in, sociology, and, anthropology, time, discipline, is, the, general, name, given, to, social, and, economic, rules, conventions, customs, and, expectations, governing, the, measurement, of, time, the, social, currency, and, awareness, of, time, measurements, and, people, s, expectations, concerning, the, observance, of, these, customs, by, others, arlie, russell, hochschild, and, norbert, elias, have, written, on, the, use, of, time, from, a, sociological, perspective, the, use, of, time, is, an, important, issue, in, understanding, human, behavior, education, and, travel, behavior, time, use, research, is, a, developing, field, of, study, the, question, concerns, how, time, is, allocated, across, a, number, of, activities, such, as, time, spent, at, home, at, work, shopping, etc, time, use, changes, with, technology, as, the, television, or, the, internet, created, new, opportunities, to, use, time, in, different, ways, however, some, aspects, of, time, use, are, relatively, stable, over, long, periods, of, time, such, as, the, amount, of, time, spent, traveling, to, work, which, despite, major, changes, in, transport, has, been, observed, to, be, about, 20, 30, minutes, one, way, for, a, large, number, of, cities, over, a, long, period, time, management, is, the, organization, of, tasks, or, events, by, first, estimating, how, much, time, a, task, requires, and, when, it, must, be, completed, and, adjusting, events, that, would, interfere, with, its, completion, so, it, is, done, in, the, appropriate, amount, of, time, calendars, and, day, planners, are, common, examples, of, time, management, tools, a, sequence, of, events, or, series, of, events, is, a, sequence, of, items, facts, events, actions, changes, or, procedural, steps, arranged, in, time, order, chronological, order, often, with, causality, relationships, among, the, items, because, of, causality, cause, precedes, effect, or, cause, and, effect, may, appear, together, in, a, single, item, but, effect, never, precedes, cause, a, sequence, of, events, can, be, presented, in, text, tables, charts, or, timelines, the, description, of, the, items, or, events, may, include, a, timestamp, a, sequence, of, events, that, includes, the, time, along, with, place, or, location, information, to, describe, a, sequential, path, may, be, referred, to, as, a, world, line, uses, of, a, sequence, of, events, include, stories, historical, events, chronology, directions, and, steps, in, procedures, and, timetables, for, scheduling, activities, a, sequence, of, events, may, also, be, used, to, help, describe, processes, in, science, technology, and, medicine, a, sequence, of, events, may, be, focused, on, past, events, e, g, stories, history, chronology, on, future, events, that, must, be, in, a,
