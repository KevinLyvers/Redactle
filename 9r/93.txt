the, moon, is, earth, s, only, natural, satellite, it, orbits, at, an, average, distance, of, 384, 400, km, 238, 900, mi, about, 30, times, the, diameter, of, earth, tidal, forces, between, earth, and, the, moon, have, synchronized, the, moon, s, orbital, period, lunar, month, with, its, rotation, period, lunar, day, at, 29, 5, earth, days, causing, the, same, side, of, the, moon, to, always, face, earth, the, moon, s, gravitational, pull, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, sun, s, are, the, main, drivers, of, earth, s, tides, in, geophysical, terms, the, moon, is, a, planetary, mass, object, or, satellite, planet, its, mass, is, 1, 2, that, of, the, earth, and, its, diameter, is, 3, 474, km, 2, 159, mi, roughly, one, quarter, of, earth, s, about, as, wide, as, the, united, states, from, coast, to, coast, within, the, solar, system, it, is, the, largest, and, most, massive, satellite, in, relation, to, its, parent, planet, the, fifth, largest, and, most, massive, moon, overall, and, larger, and, more, massive, than, all, known, dwarf, planets, its, surface, gravity, is, about, one, sixth, of, earth, s, about, half, of, that, of, mars, and, the, second, highest, among, all, solar, system, moons, after, jupiter, s, moon, io, the, body, of, the, moon, is, differentiated, and, terrestrial, with, no, significant, hydrosphere, atmosphere, or, magnetic, field, it, formed, 4, 51, billion, years, ago, not, long, after, earth, s, formation, out, of, the, debris, from, a, giant, impact, between, earth, and, a, hypothesized, mars, sized, body, called, theia, the, lunar, surface, is, covered, in, lunar, dust, and, marked, by, mountains, impact, craters, their, ejecta, ray, like, streaks, rilles, and, mostly, on, the, near, side, of, the, moon, by, dark, maria, seas, which, are, plains, of, cooled, magma, these, maria, were, formed, when, molten, lava, flowed, into, ancient, impact, basins, the, moon, is, except, when, passing, through, earth, s, shadow, during, a, lunar, eclipse, always, illuminated, by, the, sun, but, from, earth, the, visible, illumination, shifts, during, its, orbit, producing, the, lunar, phases, the, moon, is, the, brightest, celestial, object, in, earth, s, night, sky, this, is, mainly, due, to, its, large, angular, diameter, while, the, reflectance, of, the, lunar, surface, is, comparable, to, that, of, asphalt, the, apparent, size, is, nearly, the, same, as, that, of, the, sun, allowing, it, to, cover, the, sun, completely, during, a, total, solar, eclipse, from, earth, about, 59, of, the, lunar, surface, is, visible, over, time, due, to, cyclical, shifts, in, perspective, libration, making, parts, of, the, far, side, of, the, moon, visible, the, moon, has, been, an, important, source, of, inspiration, and, knowledge, for, humans, having, been, crucial, to, cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time, keeping, natural, science, and, spaceflight, in, 1959, the, first, human, made, objects, to, leave, earth, and, reach, another, body, arrived, at, the, moon, with, the, flyby, of, the, soviet, union, s, luna, 1, and, the, intentional, impact, of, luna, 2, in, 1966, the, moon, became, the, first, extraterrestrial, body, where, soft, landings, and, orbital, insertions, were, achieved, on, july, 20, 1969, humans, for, the, first, time, landed, on, the, moon, and, any, extraterrestrial, body, at, mare, tranquillitatis, with, the, lander, eagle, of, the, united, states, apollo, 11, mission, five, more, crews, were, sent, between, then, and, 1972, each, with, two, men, landing, on, the, surface, the, longest, stay, was, 75, hours, by, the, apollo, 17, crew, since, then, exploration, of, the, moon, has, continued, robotically, and, crewed, missions, are, being, planned, to, return, beginning, in, the, late, 2020s, the, usual, english, proper, name, for, earth, s, natural, satellite, is, simply, moon, with, a, capital, m, the, noun, moon, is, derived, from, old, english, m, na, which, like, all, its, germanic, cognates, stems, from, proto, germanic, m, n, n, which, in, turn, comes, from, proto, indo, european, m, nsis, month, from, earlier, m, n, t, genitive, m, neses, which, may, be, related, to, the, verb, measure, of, time, occasionally, the, name, luna, l, u, n, is, used, in, scientific, writing, and, especially, in, science, fiction, to, distinguish, the, earth, s, moon, from, others, while, in, poetry, luna, has, been, used, to, denote, personification, of, the, moon, cynthia, s, n, i, is, another, poetic, name, though, rare, for, the, moon, personified, as, a, goddess, while, selene, s, l, i, n, i, literally, moon, is, the, greek, goddess, of, the, moon, the, english, adjective, pertaining, to, the, moon, is, lunar, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, the, moon, l, na, selenian, s, l, i, n, i, n, is, an, adjective, used, to, describe, the, moon, as, a, world, rather, than, as, a, celestial, object, but, its, use, is, rare, it, is, derived, from, sel, n, the, greek, word, for, the, moon, and, its, cognate, selenic, was, originally, a, rare, synonym, but, now, nearly, always, refers, to, the, chemical, element, selenium, the, element, name, selenium, and, the, prefix, seleno, as, in, selenography, the, study, of, the, physical, features, of, the, moon, come, from, this, greek, word, the, greek, goddess, of, the, wilderness, and, the, hunt, artemis, equated, with, the, roman, diana, one, of, whose, symbols, was, the, moon, and, who, was, often, regarded, as, the, goddess, of, the, moon, was, also, called, cynthia, from, her, legendary, birthplace, on, mount, cynthus, these, names, luna, cynthia, and, selene, are, reflected, in, technical, terms, for, lunar, orbits, such, as, apolune, pericynthion, and, selenocentric, the, astronomical, symbol, for, the, moon, is, a, crescent, decrescent, for, example, in, m, lunar, mass, also, m, l, the, lunar, geological, periods, are, named, after, their, characteristic, features, from, most, impact, craters, outside, the, dark, mare, to, the, mare, and, later, craters, and, finally, the, young, still, bright, and, therefore, readily, visible, craters, with, ray, systems, like, copernicus, or, tycho, isotope, dating, of, lunar, samples, suggests, the, moon, formed, around, 50, million, years, after, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, historically, several, formation, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, but, none, satisfactorily, explains, the, features, of, the, earth, moon, system, a, fission, of, the, moon, from, earth, s, crust, through, centrifugal, force, would, require, too, great, an, initial, rotation, rate, of, earth, gravitational, capture, of, a, pre, formed, moon, depends, on, an, unfeasibly, extended, atmosphere, of, earth, to, dissipate, the, energy, of, the, passing, moon, a, co, formation, of, earth, and, the, moon, together, in, the, primordial, accretion, disk, does, not, explain, the, depletion, of, metals, in, the, moon, none, of, these, hypotheses, can, account, for, the, high, angular, momentum, of, the, earth, moon, system, the, prevailing, theory, is, that, the, earth, moon, system, formed, after, a, giant, impact, of, a, mars, sized, body, named, theia, with, the, proto, earth, the, oblique, impact, blasted, material, into, orbit, about, the, earth, and, the, material, accreted, and, formed, the, moon, just, beyond, the, earth, s, roche, limit, of, 2, 56, r, giant, impacts, are, thought, to, have, been, common, in, the, early, solar, system, computer, simulations, of, giant, impacts, have, produced, results, that, are, consistent, with, the, mass, of, the, lunar, core, and, the, angular, momentum, of, the, earth, moon, system, these, simulations, show, that, most, of, the, moon, derived, from, the, impactor, rather, than, the, proto, earth, however, models, from, 2007, and, later, suggest, a, larger, fraction, of, the, moon, derived, from, the, proto, earth, other, bodies, of, the, inner, solar, system, such, as, mars, and, vesta, have, according, to, meteorites, from, them, very, different, oxygen, and, tungsten, isotopic, compositions, compared, to, earth, however, earth, and, the, moon, have, nearly, identical, isotopic, compositions, the, isotopic, equalization, of, the, earth, moon, system, might, be, explained, by, the, post, impact, mixing, of, the, vaporized, material, that, formed, the, two, although, this, is, debated, the, impact, would, have, released, enough, energy, to, liquefy, both, the, ejecta, and, the, earth, s, crust, forming, a, magma, ocean, the, liquefied, ejecta, could, have, then, re, accreted, into, the, earth, moon, system, the, newly, formed, moon, would, have, had, its, own, magma, ocean, its, depth, is, estimated, from, about, 500, km, 300, miles, to, 1, 737, km, 1, 079, miles, while, the, giant, impact, theory, explains, many, lines, of, evidence, some, questions, are, still, unresolved, most, of, which, involve, the, moon, s, composition, models, that, have, the, moon, acquiring, a, significant, amount, of, the, proto, earth, are, more, difficult, to, reconcile, with, geochemical, data, for, the, isotopes, of, zirconium, oxygen, silicon, and, other, elements, a, study, published, in, 2022, using, high, resolution, simulations, up, to, 10, 8, particles, found, that, giant, impacts, can, immediately, place, a, satellite, with, similar, mass, and, iron, content, to, the, moon, into, orbit, far, outside, earth, s, roche, limit, even, satellites, that, initially, pass, within, the, roche, limit, can, reliably, and, predictably, survive, by, being, partially, stripped, and, then, torqued, onto, wider, stable, orbits, on, november, 1, 2023, scientists, reported, that, according, to, computer, simulations, remnants, of, a, protoplanet, named, theia, could, be, inside, the, earth, left, over, from, a, collision, with, the, earth, in, ancient, times, and, afterwards, becoming, the, moon, the, newly, formed, moon, settled, into, a, much, closer, earth, orbit, than, it, has, today, each, body, therefore, appeared, much, larger, in, the, sky, of, the, other, eclipses, were, more, frequent, and, tidal, effects, were, stronger, due, to, tidal, acceleration, the, moon, s, orbit, around, earth, has, become, significantly, larger, with, a, longer, period, following, formation, the, moon, has, cooled, and, most, of, its, atmosphere, has, been, stripped, the, lunar, surface, has, since, been, shaped, by, large, impact, events, and, many, small, ones, forming, a, landscape, featuring, craters, of, all, ages, the, moon, was, volcanically, active, until, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, which, laid, down, the, prominent, lunar, maria, most, of, the, mare, basalts, erupted, during, the, imbrian, period, 3, 3, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, though, some, are, as, young, as, 1, 2, billion, years, and, some, as, old, as, 4, 2, billion, years, there, are, differing, explanations, for, the, eruption, of, mare, basalts, particularly, their, uneven, occurrence, which, mainly, appear, on, the, near, side, causes, of, the, distribution, of, the, lunar, highlands, on, the, far, side, are, also, not, well, understood, topological, measurements, show, the, near, side, crust, is, thinner, than, the, far, side, one, possible, scenario, then, is, that, large, impacts, on, the, near, side, may, have, made, it, easier, for, lava, to, flow, onto, the, surface, the, moon, is, a, very, slightly, scalene, ellipsoid, due, to, tidal, stretching, with, its, long, axis, displaced, 30, from, facing, the, earth, due, to, gravitational, anomalies, from, impact, basins, its, shape, is, more, elongated, than, current, tidal, forces, can, account, for, this, fossil, bulge, indicates, that, the, moon, solidified, when, it, orbited, at, half, its, current, distance, to, the, earth, and, that, it, is, now, too, cold, for, its, shape, to, restore, hydrostatic, equilibrium, at, its, current, orbital, distance, the, moon, is, by, size, and, mass, the, fifth, largest, natural, satellite, of, the, solar, system, categorizable, as, one, of, its, planetary, mass, moons, making, it, a, satellite, planet, under, the, geophysical, definitions, of, the, term, it, is, smaller, than, mercury, and, considerably, larger, than, the, largest, dwarf, planet, of, the, solar, system, pluto, while, the, minor, planet, moon, charon, of, the, pluto, charon, system, is, larger, relative, to, pluto, the, moon, is, the, largest, natural, satellite, of, the, solar, system, relative, to, their, primary, planets, the, moon, s, diameter, is, about, 3, 500, km, more, than, a, quarter, of, earth, s, with, the, face, of, the, moon, comparable, to, the, width, of, either, mainland, australia, europe, or, the, contiguous, united, states, which, excludes, alaska, etc, the, whole, surface, area, of, the, moon, is, about, 38, million, square, kilometers, comparable, to, north, and, south, america, combined, the, combined, american, landmass, having, an, area, excluding, all, islands, of, 37, 7, million, square, kilometers, the, moon, s, mass, is, 1, 81, of, earth, s, being, the, second, densest, among, the, planetary, moons, and, having, the, second, highest, surface, gravity, after, io, at, 0, 1654, g, and, an, escape, velocity, of, 2, 38, km, s, 8, 600, km, h, 5, 300, mph, the, moon, is, a, differentiated, body, that, was, initially, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, but, has, since, departed, from, this, condition, it, has, a, geochemically, distinct, crust, mantle, and, core, the, moon, has, a, solid, iron, rich, inner, core, with, a, radius, possibly, as, small, as, 240, kilometres, 150, mi, and, a, fluid, outer, core, primarily, made, of, liquid, iron, with, a, radius, of, roughly, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, around, the, core, is, a, partially, molten, boundary, layer, with, a, radius, of, about, 500, kilometres, 310, mi, this, structure, is, thought, to, have, developed, through, the, fractional, crystallization, of, a, global, magma, ocean, shortly, after, the, moon, s, formation, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, crystallization, of, this, magma, ocean, would, have, created, a, mafic, mantle, from, the, precipitation, and, sinking, of, the, minerals, olivine, clinopyroxene, and, orthopyroxene, after, about, three, quarters, of, the, magma, ocean, had, crystallized, lower, density, plagioclase, minerals, could, form, and, float, into, a, crust, atop, the, final, liquids, to, crystallize, would, have, been, initially, sandwiched, between, the, crust, and, mantle, with, a, high, abundance, of, incompatible, and, heat, producing, elements, consistent, with, this, perspective, geochemical, mapping, made, from, orbit, suggests, a, crust, of, mostly, anorthosite, the, moon, rock, samples, of, the, flood, lavas, that, erupted, onto, the, surface, from, partial, melting, in, the, mantle, confirm, the, mafic, mantle, composition, which, is, more, iron, rich, than, that, of, earth, the, crust, is, on, average, about, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, thick, the, moon, is, the, second, densest, satellite, in, the, solar, system, after, io, however, the, inner, core, of, the, moon, is, small, with, a, radius, of, about, 350, kilometres, 220, mi, or, less, around, 20, of, the, radius, of, the, moon, its, composition, is, not, well, understood, but, is, probably, metallic, iron, alloyed, with, a, small, amount, of, sulfur, and, nickel, analyzes, of, the, moon, s, time, variable, rotation, suggest, that, it, is, at, least, partly, molten, the, pressure, at, the, lunar, core, is, estimated, to, be, 5, gpa, 49, 000, atm, on, average, the, moon, s, surface, gravity, is, 1, 62, m, s, 2, 0, 1654, g, 5, 318, ft, s, 2, about, half, of, the, surface, gravity, of, mars, and, about, a, sixth, of, earth, s, the, moon, s, gravitational, field, is, not, uniform, the, details, of, the, gravitational, field, have, been, measured, through, tracking, the, doppler, shift, of, radio, signals, emitted, by, orbiting, spacecraft, the, main, lunar, gravity, features, are, mascons, large, positive, gravitational, anomalies, associated, with, some, of, the, giant, impact, basins, partly, caused, by, the, dense, mare, basaltic, lava, flows, that, fill, those, basins, the, anomalies, greatly, influence, the, orbit, of, spacecraft, about, the, moon, there, are, some, puzzles, lava, flows, by, themselves, cannot, explain, all, of, the, gravitational, signature, and, some, mascons, exist, that, are, not, linked, to, mare, volcanism, the, moon, has, an, external, magnetic, field, of, less, than, 0, 2, nanoteslas, or, less, than, one, hundred, thousandth, that, of, earth, the, moon, does, not, have, a, global, dipolar, magnetic, field, and, only, has, crustal, magnetization, likely, acquired, early, in, its, history, when, a, dynamo, was, still, operating, early, in, its, history, 4, billion, years, ago, its, magnetic, field, strength, was, likely, close, to, that, of, earth, today, this, early, dynamo, field, apparently, expired, by, about, one, billion, years, ago, after, the, lunar, core, had, crystallized, theoretically, some, of, the, remnant, magnetization, may, originate, from, transient, magnetic, fields, generated, during, large, impacts, through, the, expansion, of, plasma, clouds, these, clouds, are, generated, during, large, impacts, in, an, ambient, magnetic, field, this, is, supported, by, the, location, of, the, largest, crustal, magnetizations, situated, near, the, antipodes, of, the, giant, impact, basins, the, moon, has, an, atmosphere, so, tenuous, as, to, be, nearly, vacuum, with, a, total, mass, of, less, than, 10, tonnes, 9, 8, long, tons, 11, short, tons, the, surface, pressure, of, this, small, mass, is, around, 3, 10, 15, atm, 0, 3, npa, it, varies, with, the, lunar, day, its, sources, include, outgassing, and, sputtering, a, product, of, the, bombardment, of, lunar, soil, by, solar, wind, ions, elements, that, have, been, detected, include, sodium, and, potassium, produced, by, sputtering, also, found, in, the, atmospheres, of, mercury, and, io, helium, 4, and, neon, from, the, solar, wind, and, argon, 40, radon, 222, and, polonium, 210, outgassed, after, their, creation, by, radioactive, decay, within, the, crust, and, mantle, the, absence, of, such, neutral, species, atoms, or, molecules, as, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and, magnesium, which, are, present, in, the, regolith, is, not, understood, water, vapor, has, been, detected, by, chandrayaan, 1, and, found, to, vary, with, latitude, with, a, maximum, at, 60, 70, degrees, it, is, possibly, generated, from, the, sublimation, of, water, ice, in, the, regolith, these, gases, either, return, into, the, regolith, because, of, the, moon, s, gravity, or, are, lost, to, space, either, through, solar, radiation, pressure, or, if, they, are, ionized, by, being, swept, away, by, the, solar, wind, s, magnetic, field, studies, of, moon, magma, samples, retrieved, by, the, apollo, missions, demonstrate, that, the, moon, had, once, possessed, a, relatively, thick, atmosphere, for, a, period, of, 70, million, years, between, 3, and, 4, billion, years, ago, this, atmosphere, sourced, from, gases, ejected, from, lunar, volcanic, eruptions, was, twice, the, thickness, of, that, of, present, day, mars, the, ancient, lunar, atmosphere, was, eventually, stripped, away, by, solar, winds, and, dissipated, into, space, a, permanent, moon, dust, cloud, exists, around, the, moon, generated, by, small, particles, from, comets, estimates, are, 5, tons, of, comet, particles, strike, the, moon, s, surface, every, 24, hours, resulting, in, the, ejection, of, dust, particles, the, dust, stays, above, the, moon, approximately, 10, minutes, taking, 5, minutes, to, rise, and, 5, minutes, to, fall, on, average, 120, kilograms, of, dust, are, present, above, the, moon, rising, up, to, 100, kilometers, above, the, surface, dust, counts, made, by, ladee, s, lunar, dust, experiment, ldex, found, particle, counts, peaked, during, the, geminid, quadrantid, northern, taurid, and, omicron, centaurid, meteor, showers, when, the, earth, and, moon, pass, through, comet, debris, the, lunar, dust, cloud, is, asymmetric, being, more, dense, near, the, boundary, between, the, moon, s, dayside, and, nightside, ionizing, radiation, from, cosmic, rays, the, sun, and, the, resulting, neutron, radiation, produce, radiation, levels, on, average, of, 1, 369, millisieverts, per, day, during, lunar, daytime, which, is, about, 2, 6, times, more, than, on, the, international, space, station, with, 0, 53, millisieverts, per, day, at, about, 400, km, above, earth, in, orbit, 5, 10, times, more, than, during, a, trans, atlantic, flight, 200, times, more, than, on, earth, s, surface, for, further, comparison, radiation, on, a, flight, to, mars, is, about, 1, 84, millisieverts, per, day, and, on, mars, on, average, 0, 64, millisieverts, per, day, with, some, locations, on, mars, possibly, having, levels, as, low, as, 0, 342, millisieverts, per, day, the, moon, s, axial, tilt, with, respect, to, the, ecliptic, is, only, 1, 5427, much, less, than, the, 23, 44, of, earth, because, of, this, small, tilt, the, moon, s, solar, illumination, varies, much, less, with, season, than, on, earth, and, it, allows, for, the, existence, of, some, peaks, of, eternal, light, at, the, moon, s, north, pole, at, the, rim, of, the, crater, peary, the, surface, is, exposed, to, drastic, temperature, differences, ranging, from, 120, c, to, 171, c, depending, on, the, solar, irradiance, because, of, the, lack, of, atmosphere, temperatures, of, different, areas, vary, particularly, upon, whether, they, are, in, sunlight, or, shadow, making, topographical, details, play, a, decisive, role, on, local, surface, temperatures, parts, of, many, craters, particularly, the, bottoms, of, many, polar, craters, are, permanently, shadowed, these, craters, of, eternal, darkness, have, extremely, low, temperatures, the, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, measured, the, lowest, summer, temperatures, in, craters, at, the, southern, pole, at, 35, k, 238, c, 397, f, and, just, 26, k, 247, c, 413, f, close, to, the, winter, solstice, in, the, north, polar, crater, hermite, this, is, the, coldest, temperature, in, the, solar, system, ever, measured, by, a, spacecraft, colder, even, than, the, surface, of, pluto, blanketed, on, top, of, the, moon, s, crust, is, a, highly, comminuted, broken, into, ever, smaller, particles, and, impact, gardened, mostly, gray, surface, layer, called, regolith, formed, by, impact, processes, the, finer, regolith, the, lunar, soil, of, silicon, dioxide, glass, has, a, texture, resembling, snow, and, a, scent, resembling, spent, gunpowder, the, regolith, of, older, surfaces, is, generally, thicker, than, for, younger, surfaces, it, varies, in, thickness, from, 10, 15, m, 33, 49, ft, in, the, highlands, and, 4, 5, m, 13, 16, ft, in, the, maria, beneath, the, finely, comminuted, regolith, layer, is, the, megaregolith, a, layer, of, highly, fractured, bedrock, many, kilometers, thick, these, extreme, conditions, for, example, are, considered, to, make, it, unlikely, for, spacecraft, to, harbor, bacterial, spores, at, the, moon, longer, than, just, one, lunar, orbit, the, topography, of, the, moon, has, been, measured, with, laser, altimetry, and, stereo, image, analysis, its, most, extensive, topographic, feature, is, the, giant, far, side, south, pole, aitken, basin, some, 2, 240, km, 1, 390, mi, in, diameter, the, largest, crater, on, the, moon, and, the, second, largest, confirmed, impact, crater, in, the, solar, system, at, 13, km, 8, 1, mi, deep, its, floor, is, the, lowest, point, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, the, highest, elevations, of, the, moon, s, surface, are, located, directly, to, the, northeast, which, might, have, been, thickened, by, the, oblique, formation, impact, of, the, south, pole, aitken, basin, other, large, impact, basins, such, as, imbrium, serenitatis, crisium, smythii, and, orientale, possess, regionally, low, elevations, and, elevated, rims, the, far, side, of, the, lunar, surface, is, on, average, about, 1, 9, km, 1, 2, mi, higher, than, that, of, the, near, side, the, discovery, of, fault, scarp, cliffs, suggest, that, the, moon, has, shrunk, by, about, 90, metres, 300, ft, within, the, past, billion, years, similar, shrinkage, features, exist, on, mercury, mare, frigoris, a, basin, near, the, north, pole, long, assumed, to, be, geologically, dead, has, cracked, and, shifted, since, the, moon, does, not, have, tectonic, plates, its, tectonic, activity, is, slow, and, cracks, develop, as, it, loses, heat, scientists, have, confirmed, the, presence, of, a, cave, on, the, moon, near, the, sea, of, tranquillity, not, far, from, the, 1969, apollo, 11, landing, site, the, cave, identified, as, an, entry, point, to, a, collapsed, lava, tube, is, roughly, 45, meters, wide, and, up, to, 80, m, long, this, discovery, marks, the, first, confirmed, entry, point, to, a, lunar, cave, the, analysis, was, based, on, photos, taken, in, 2010, by, nasa, s, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, the, cave, s, stable, temperature, of, around, 17, c, could, provide, a, hospitable, environment, for, future, astronauts, protecting, them, from, extreme, temperatures, solar, radiation, and, micrometeorites, however, challenges, include, accessibility, and, risks, of, avalanches, and, cave, ins, this, discovery, offers, potential, for, future, lunar, bases, or, emergency, shelters, the, main, features, visible, from, earth, by, the, naked, eye, are, dark, and, relatively, featureless, lunar, plains, called, maria, singular, mare, latin, for, seas, as, they, were, once, believed, to, be, filled, with, water, are, vast, solidified, pools, of, ancient, basaltic, lava, although, similar, to, terrestrial, basalts, lunar, basalts, have, more, iron, and, no, minerals, altered, by, water, the, majority, of, these, lava, deposits, erupted, or, flowed, into, the, depressions, associated, with, impact, basins, though, the, moon, s, largest, expanse, of, basalt, flooding, oceanus, procellarum, does, not, correspond, to, an, obvious, impact, basin, different, episodes, of, lava, flows, in, maria, can, often, be, recognized, by, variations, in, surface, albedo, and, distinct, flow, margins, as, the, maria, formed, cooling, and, contraction, of, the, basaltic, lava, created, wrinkle, ridges, in, some, areas, these, low, sinuous, ridges, can, extend, for, hundreds, of, kilometers, and, often, outline, buried, structures, within, the, mare, another, result, of, maria, formation, is, the, creation, of, concentric, depressions, along, the, edges, known, as, arcuate, rilles, these, features, occur, as, the, mare, basalts, sink, inward, under, their, own, weight, causing, the, edges, to, fracture, and, separate, in, addition, to, the, visible, maria, the, moon, has, mare, deposits, covered, by, ejecta, from, impacts, called, cryptomares, these, hidden, mares, are, likely, older, than, the, exposed, ones, conversely, mare, lava, has, obscured, many, impact, melt, sheets, and, pools, impact, melts, are, formed, when, intense, shock, pressures, from, collisions, vaporize, and, melt, zones, around, the, impact, site, where, still, exposed, impact, melt, can, be, distinguished, from, mare, lava, by, its, distribution, albedo, and, texture, sinuous, rilles, found, in, and, around, maria, are, likely, extinct, lava, channels, or, collapsed, lava, tubes, they, typically, originate, from, volcanic, vents, meandering, and, sometimes, branching, as, they, progress, the, largest, examples, such, as, schroter, s, valley, and, rima, hadley, are, significantly, longer, wider, and, deeper, than, terrestrial, lava, channels, sometimes, featuring, bends, and, sharp, turns, that, again, are, uncommon, on, earth, mare, volcanism, has, altered, impact, craters, in, various, ways, including, filling, them, to, varying, degrees, and, raising, and, fracturing, their, floors, from, uplift, of, mare, material, beneath, their, interiors, examples, of, such, craters, include, taruntius, and, gassendi, some, craters, such, as, hyginus, are, of, wholly, volcanic, origin, forming, as, calderas, or, collapse, pits, such, craters, are, relatively, rare, and, tend, to, be, smaller, typically, a, few, kilometers, wide, shallower, and, more, irregularly, shaped, than, impact, craters, they, also, lack, the, upturned, rims, characterstic, of, impact, craters, several, geologic, provinces, containing, shield, volcanoes, and, volcanic, domes, are, found, within, the, near, side, maria, there, are, also, some, regions, of, pyroclastic, deposits, scoria, cones, and, non, basaltic, domes, made, of, particularly, high, viscosity, lava, almost, all, maria, are, on, the, near, side, of, the, moon, and, cover, 31, of, the, surface, of, the, near, side, compared, with, 2, of, the, far, side, this, is, likely, due, to, a, concentration, of, heat, producing, elements, under, the, crust, on, the, near, side, which, would, have, caused, the, underlying, mantle, to, heat, up, partially, melt, rise, to, the, surface, and, erupt, most, of, the, moon, s, mare, basalts, erupted, during, the, imbrian, period, 3, 3, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, though, some, being, as, young, as, 1, 2, billion, years, and, as, old, as, 4, 2, billion, years, in, 2006, a, study, of, ina, a, tiny, depression, in, lacus, felicitatis, found, jagged, relatively, dust, free, features, that, because, of, the, lack, of, erosion, by, infalling, debris, appeared, to, be, only, 2, million, years, old, moonquakes, and, releases, of, gas, indicate, continued, lunar, activity, evidence, of, recent, lunar, volcanism, has, been, identified, at, 70, irregular, mare, patches, some, less, than, 50, million, years, old, this, raises, the, possibility, of, a, much, warmer, lunar, mantle, than, previously, believed, at, least, on, the, near, side, where, the, deep, crust, is, substantially, warmer, because, of, the, greater, concentration, of, radioactive, elements, evidence, has, been, found, for, 2, 10, million, years, old, basaltic, volcanism, within, the, crater, lowell, inside, the, orientale, basin, some, combination, of, an, initially, hotter, mantle, and, local, enrichment, of, heat, producing, elements, in, the, mantle, could, be, responsible, for, prolonged, activities, on, the, far, side, in, the, orientale, basin, the, lighter, colored, regions, of, the, moon, are, called, terrae, or, more, commonly, highlands, because, they, are, higher, than, most, maria, they, have, been, radiometrically, dated, to, having, formed, 4, 4, billion, years, ago, and, may, represent, plagioclase, cumulates, of, the, lunar, magma, ocean, in, contrast, to, earth, no, major, lunar, mountains, are, believed, to, have, formed, as, a, result, of, tectonic, events, the, concentration, of, maria, on, the, near, side, likely, reflects, the, substantially, thicker, crust, of, the, highlands, of, the, far, side, which, may, have, formed, in, a, slow, velocity, impact, of, a, second, moon, of, earth, a, few, tens, of, millions, of, years, after, the, moon, s, formation, alternatively, it, may, be, a, consequence, of, asymmetrical, tidal, heating, when, the, moon, was, much, closer, to, the, earth, a, major, geologic, process, that, has, affected, the, moon, s, surface, is, impact, cratering, with, craters, formed, when, asteroids, and, comets, collide, with, the, lunar, surface, there, are, estimated, to, be, roughly, 300, 000, craters, wider, than, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, on, the, moon, s, near, side, lunar, craters, exhibit, a, variety, of, forms, depending, on, their, size, in, order, of, increasing, diameter, the, basic, types, are, simple, craters, with, smooth, bowl, shaped, interiors, and, upturned, rims, complex, craters, with, flat, floors, terraced, walls, and, central, peaks, peak, ring, basins, and, multi, ring, basins, with, two, or, more, concentric, rings, of, peaks, the, vast, majority, of, impact, craters, are, circular, but, some, like, cantor, and, janssen, have, more, polygonal, outlines, possibly, guided, by, underlying, faults, and, joints, others, such, as, the, messier, pair, schiller, and, daniell, are, elongated, such, elongation, can, result, from, highly, oblique, impacts, binary, asteroid, impacts, fragmentation, of, impactors, before, surface, strike, or, closely, spaced, secondary, impacts, the, lunar, geologic, timescale, is, based, on, the, most, prominent, impact, events, such, as, multi, ring, formations, like, nectaris, imbrium, and, orientale, that, are, between, hundreds, and, thousands, of, kilometers, in, diameter, and, associated, with, a, broad, apron, of, ejecta, deposits, that, form, a, regional, stratigraphic, horizon, the, lack, of, an, atmosphere, weather, and, recent, geological, processes, mean, that, many, of, these, craters, are, well, preserved, although, only, a, few, multi, ring, basins, have, been, definitively, dated, they, are, useful, for, assigning, relative, ages, because, impact, craters, accumulate, at, a, nearly, constant, rate, counting, the, number, of, craters, per, unit, area, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, age, of, the, surface, however, care, needs, to, be, exercised, with, the, crater, counting, technique, due, to, the, potential, presence, of, secondary, craters, ejecta, from, impacts, can, create, secondary, craters, that, often, appear, in, clusters, or, chains, but, can, also, occur, as, isolated, formations, at, a, considerable, distance, from, the, impact, these, can, resemble, primary, craters, and, may, even, dominate, small, crater, populations, so, their, unidentified, presence, can, distort, age, estimates, the, radiometric, ages, of, impact, melted, rocks, collected, during, the, apollo, missions, cluster, between, 3, 8, and, 4, 1, billion, years, old, this, has, been, used, to, propose, a, late, heavy, bombardment, period, of, increased, impacts, high, resolution, images, from, the, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, in, the, 2010s, show, a, contemporary, crater, production, rate, significantly, higher, than, was, previously, estimated, a, secondary, cratering, process, caused, by, distal, ejecta, is, thought, to, churn, the, top, two, centimeters, of, regolith, on, a, timescale, of, 81, 000, years, this, rate, is, 100, times, faster, than, the, rate, computed, from, models, based, solely, on, direct, micrometeorite, impacts, lunar, swirls, are, enigmatic, features, found, across, the, moon, s, surface, they, are, characterized, by, a, high, albedo, appear, optically, immature, i, e, the, optical, characteristics, of, a, relatively, young, regolith, and, often, have, a, sinuous, shape, their, shape, is, often, accentuated, by, low, albedo, regions, that, wind, between, the, bright, swirls, they, are, located, in, places, with, enhanced, surface, magnetic, fields, and, many, are, located, at, the, antipodal, point, of, major, impacts, well, known, swirls, include, the, reiner, gamma, feature, and, mare, ingenii, they, are, hypothesized, to, be, areas, that, have, been, partially, shielded, from, the, solar, wind, resulting, in, slower, space, weathering, liquid, water, cannot, persist, on, the, lunar, surface, when, exposed, to, solar, radiation, water, quickly, decomposes, through, a, process, known, as, photodissociation, and, is, lost, to, space, however, since, the, 1960s, scientists, have, hypothesized, that, water, ice, may, be, deposited, by, impacting, comets, or, possibly, produced, by, the, reaction, of, oxygen, rich, lunar, rocks, and, hydrogen, from, solar, wind, leaving, traces, of, water, which, could, possibly, persist, in, cold, permanently, shadowed, craters, at, either, pole, on, the, moon, computer, simulations, suggest, that, up, to, 14, 000, km, 2, 5, 400, sq, mi, of, the, surface, may, be, in, permanent, shadow, the, presence, of, usable, quantities, of, water, on, the, moon, is, an, important, factor, in, rendering, lunar, habitation, as, a, cost, effective, plan, the, alternative, of, transporting, water, from, earth, would, be, prohibitively, expensive, in, years, since, signatures, of, water, have, been, found, to, exist, on, the, lunar, surface, in, 1994, the, bistatic, radar, experiment, located, on, the, clementine, spacecraft, indicated, the, existence, of, small, frozen, pockets, of, water, close, to, the, surface, however, later, radar, observations, by, arecibo, suggest, these, findings, may, rather, be, rocks, ejected, from, young, impact, craters, in, 1998, the, neutron, spectrometer, on, the, lunar, prospector, spacecraft, showed, that, high, concentrations, of, hydrogen, are, present, in, the, first, meter, of, depth, in, the, regolith, near, the, polar, regions, volcanic, lava, beads, brought, back, to, earth, aboard, apollo, 15, showed, small, amounts, of, water, in, their, interior, the, 2008, chandrayaan, 1, spacecraft, has, since, confirmed, the, existence, of, surface, water, ice, using, the, on, board, moon, mineralogy, mapper, the, spectrometer, observed, absorption, lines, common, to, hydroxyl, in, reflected, sunlight, providing, evidence, of, large, quantities, of, water, ice, on, the, lunar, surface, the, spacecraft, showed, that, concentrations, may, possibly, be, as, high, as, 1, 000, ppm, using, the, mapper, s, reflectance, spectra, indirect, lighting, of, areas, in, shadow, confirmed, water, ice, within, 20, latitude, of, both, poles, in, 2018, in, 2009, lcross, sent, a, 2, 300, kg, 5, 100, lb, impactor, into, a, permanently, shadowed, polar, crater, and, detected, at, least, 100, kg, 220, lb, of, water, in, a, plume, of, ejected, material, another, examination, of, the, lcross, data, showed, the, amount, of, detected, water, to, be, closer, to, 155, 12, kg, 342, 26, lb, in, may, 2011, 615, 1410, ppm, water, in, melt, inclusions, in, lunar, sample, 74220, was, reported, the, famous, high, titanium, orange, glass, soil, of, volcanic, origin, collected, during, the, apollo, 17, mission, in, 1972, the, inclusions, were, formed, during, explosive, eruptions, on, the, moon, approximately, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, this, concentration, is, comparable, with, that, of, magma, in, earth, s, upper, mantle, although, of, considerable, selenological, interest, this, insight, does, not, mean, that, water, is, easily, available, since, the, sample, originated, many, kilometers, below, the, surface, and, the, inclusions, are, so, difficult, to, access, that, it, took, 39, years, to, find, them, with, a, state, of, the, art, ion, microprobe, instrument, analysis, of, the, findings, of, the, moon, mineralogy, mapper, m3, revealed, in, august, 2018, for, the, first, time, definitive, evidence, for, water, ice, on, the, lunar, surface, the, data, revealed, the, distinct, reflective, signatures, of, water, ice, as, opposed, to, dust, and, other, reflective, substances, the, ice, deposits, were, found, on, the, north, and, south, poles, although, it, is, more, abundant, in, the, south, where, water, is, trapped, in, permanently, shadowed, craters, and, crevices, allowing, it, to, persist, as, ice, on, the, surface, since, they, are, shielded, from, the, sun, in, october, 2020, astronomers, reported, detecting, molecular, water, on, the, sunlit, surface, of, the, moon, by, several, independent, spacecraft, including, the, stratospheric, observatory, for, infrared, astronomy, sofia, the, earth, and, the, moon, form, the, earth, moon, satellite, system, with, a, shared, center, of, mass, or, barycenter, this, barycenter, is, 1, 700, km, 1, 100, mi, about, a, quarter, of, earth, s, radius, beneath, the, earth, s, surface, the, moon, s, orbit, is, slightly, elliptical, with, an, orbital, eccentricity, of, 0, 055, the, semi, major, axis, of, the, geocentric, lunar, orbit, called, the, lunar, distance, is, approximately, 400, 000, km, 250, 000, miles, or, 1, 28, light, seconds, comparable, to, going, around, earth, 9, 5, times, the, moon, makes, a, complete, orbit, around, earth, with, respect, to, the, fixed, stars, its, sidereal, period, about, once, every, 27, 3, days, however, because, the, earth, moon, system, moves, at, the, same, time, in, its, orbit, around, the, sun, it, takes, slightly, longer, 29, 5, days, to, return, at, the, same, lunar, phase, completing, a, full, cycle, as, seen, from, earth, this, synodic, period, or, synodic, month, is, commonly, known, as, the, lunar, month, and, is, equal, to, the, length, of, the, solar, day, on, the, moon, due, to, tidal, locking, the, moon, has, a, 1, 1, spin, orbit, resonance, this, rotation, orbit, ratio, makes, the, moon, s, orbital, periods, around, earth, equal, to, its, corresponding, rotation, periods, this, is, the, reason, for, only, one, side, of, the, moon, its, so, called, near, side, being, visible, from, earth, that, said, while, the, movement, of, the, moon, is, in, resonance, it, still, is, not, without, nuances, such, as, libration, resulting, in, slightly, changing, perspectives, making, over, time, and, location, on, earth, about, 59, of, the, moon, s, surface, visible, from, earth, unlike, most, satellites, of, other, planets, the, moon, s, orbital, plane, is, closer, to, the, ecliptic, plane, than, to, the, planet, s, equatorial, plane, the, moon, s, orbit, is, subtly, perturbed, by, the, sun, and, earth, in, many, small, complex, and, interacting, ways, for, example, the, plane, of, the, moon, s, orbit, gradually, rotates, once, every, 18, 61, years, which, affects, other, aspects, of, lunar, motion, these, follow, on, effects, are, mathematically, described, by, cassini, s, laws, the, gravitational, attraction, that, earth, and, the, moon, as, well, as, the, sun, exert, on, each, other, manifests, in, a, slightly, greater, attraction, on, the, sides, closest, to, each, other, resulting, in, tidal, forces, ocean, tides, are, the, most, widely, experienced, result, of, this, but, tidal, forces, also, considerably, affect, other, mechanics, of, earth, as, well, as, the, moon, and, their, system, the, lunar, solid, crust, experiences, tides, of, around, 10, cm, 4, in, amplitude, over, 27, days, with, three, components, a, fixed, one, due, to, earth, because, they, are, in, synchronous, rotation, a, variable, tide, due, to, orbital, eccentricity, and, inclination, and, a, small, varying, component, from, the, sun, the, earth, induced, variable, component, arises, from, changing, distance, and, libration, a, result, of, the, moon, s, orbital, eccentricity, and, inclination, if, the, moon, s, orbit, were, perfectly, circular, and, un, inclined, there, would, only, be, solar, tides, according, to, recent, research, scientists, suggest, that, the, moon, s, influence, on, the, earth, may, contribute, to, maintaining, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, cumulative, effects, of, stress, built, up, by, these, tidal, forces, produces, moonquakes, moonquakes, are, much, less, common, and, weaker, than, are, earthquakes, although, moonquakes, can, last, for, up, to, an, hour, significantly, longer, than, terrestrial, quakes, because, of, scattering, of, the, seismic, vibrations, in, the, dry, fragmented, upper, crust, the, existence, of, moonquakes, was, an, unexpected, discovery, from, seismometers, placed, on, the, moon, by, apollo, astronauts, from, 1969, through, 1972, the, most, commonly, known, effect, of, tidal, forces, are, elevated, sea, levels, called, ocean, tides, while, the, moon, exerts, most, of, the, tidal, forces, the, sun, also, exerts, tidal, forces, and, therefore, contributes, to, the, tides, as, much, as, 40, of, the, moon, s, tidal, force, producing, in, interplay, the, spring, and, neap, tides, the, tides, are, two, bulges, in, the, earth, s, oceans, one, on, the, side, facing, the, moon, and, the, other, on, the, side, opposite, as, the, earth, rotates, on, its, axis, one, of, the, ocean, bulges, high, tide, is, held, in, place, under, the, moon, while, another, such, tide, is, opposite, as, a, result, there, are, two, high, tides, and, two, low, tides, in, about, 24, hours, since, the, moon, is, orbiting, the, earth, in, the, same, direction, of, the, earth, s, rotation, the, high, tides, occur, about, every, 12, hours, and, 25, minutes, the, 25, minutes, is, due, to, the, moon, s, time, to, orbit, the, earth, if, the, earth, were, a, water, world, one, with, no, continents, it, would, produce, a, tide, of, only, one, meter, and, that, tide, would, be, very, predictable, but, the, ocean, tides, are, greatly, modified, by, other, effects, as, a, result, the, timing, of, the, tides, at, most, points, on, the, earth, is, a, product, of, observations, that, are, explained, incidentally, by, theory, delays, in, the, tidal, peaks, of, both, ocean, and, solid, body, tides, cause, torque, in, opposition, to, the, earth, s, rotation, this, drains, angular, momentum, and, rotational, kinetic, energy, from, earth, s, rotation, slowing, the, earth, s, rotation, that, angular, momentum, lost, from, the, earth, is, transferred, to, the, moon, in, a, process, known, as, tidal, acceleration, which, lifts, the, moon, into, a, higher, orbit, while, lowering, orbital, speed, around, the, earth, thus, the, distance, between, earth, and, moon, is, increasing, and, the, earth, s, rotation, is, slowing, in, reaction, measurements, from, laser, reflectors, left, during, the, apollo, missions, lunar, ranging, experiments, have, found, that, the, moon, s, distance, increases, by, 38, mm, 1, 5, in, per, year, roughly, the, rate, at, which, human, fingernails, grow, atomic, clocks, show, that, earth, s, day, lengthens, by, about, 17, microseconds, every, year, slowly, increasing, the, rate, at, which, utc, is, adjusted, by, leap, seconds, this, tidal, drag, makes, the, rotation, of, the, earth, and, the, orbital, period, of, the, moon, very, slowly, match, this, matching, first, results, in, tidally, locking, the, lighter, body, of, the, orbital, system, as, is, already, the, case, with, the, moon, theoretically, in, 50, billion, years, the, earth, s, rotation, will, have, slowed, to, the, point, of, matching, the, moon, s, orbital, period, causing, the, earth, to, always, present, the, same, side, to, the, moon, however, the, sun, will, become, a, red, giant, most, likely, engulfing, the, earth, moon, system, long, before, then, if, the, earth, moon, system, isn, t, engulfed, by, the, enlarged, sun, the, drag, from, the, solar, atmosphere, can, cause, the, orbit, of, the, moon, to, decay, once, the, orbit, of, the, moon, closes, to, a, distance, of, 18, 470, km, 11, 480, mi, it, will, cross, earth, s, roche, limit, meaning, that, tidal, interaction, with, earth, would, break, apart, the, moon, turning, it, into, a, ring, system, most, of, the, orbiting, rings, will, begin, to, decay, and, the, debris, will, impact, earth, hence, even, if, the, sun, does, not, swallow, up, earth, the, planet, may, be, left, moonless, the, moon, s, highest, altitude, at, culmination, varies, by, its, lunar, phase, or, more, correctly, its, orbital, position, and, time, of, the, year, or, more, correctly, the, position, of, the, earth, s, axis, the, full, moon, is, highest, in, the, sky, during, winter, and, lowest, during, summer, for, each, hemisphere, respectively, with, its, altitude, changing, towards, dark, moon, to, the, opposite, at, the, north, and, south, poles, the, moon, is, 24, hours, above, the, horizon, for, two, weeks, every, tropical, month, about, 27, 3, days, comparable, to, the, polar, day, of, the, tropical, year, zooplankton, in, the, arctic, use, moonlight, when, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, for, months, on, end, the, apparent, orientation, of, the, moon, depends, on, its, position, in, the, sky, and, the, hemisphere, of, the, earth, from, which, it, is, being, viewed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, appears, upside, down, compared, to, the, view, from, the, southern, hemisphere, sometimes, the, horns, of, a, crescent, moon, appear, to, be, pointing, more, upwards, than, sideways, this, phenomenon, is, called, a, wet, moon, and, occurs, more, frequently, in, the, tropics, the, distance, between, the, moon, and, earth, varies, from, around, 356, 400, km, 221, 500, mi, perigee, to, 406, 700, km, 252, 700, mi, apogee, making, the, moon, s, distance, and, apparent, size, fluctuate, up, to, 14, on, average, the, moon, s, angular, diameter, is, about, 0, 52, roughly, the, same, apparent, size, as, the, sun, see, eclipses, in, addition, a, purely, psychological, effect, known, as, the, moon, illusion, makes, the, moon, appear, larger, when, close, to, the, horizon, despite, the, moon, s, tidal, locking, the, effect, of, libration, makes, about, 59, of, the, moon, s, surface, visible, from, earth, over, the, course, of, one, month, the, tidally, locked, synchronous, rotation, of, the, moon, as, it, orbits, the, earth, results, in, it, always, keeping, nearly, the, same, face, turned, towards, the, planet, the, side, of, the, moon, that, faces, earth, is, called, the, near, side, and, the, opposite, the, far, side, the, far, side, is, often, inaccurately, called, the, dark, side, but, it, is, in, fact, illuminated, as, often, as, the, near, side, once, every, 29, 5, earth, days, during, dark, moon, to, new, moon, the, near, side, is, dark, the, moon, originally, rotated, at, a, faster, rate, but, early, in, its, history, its, rotation, slowed, and, became, tidally, locked, in, this, orientation, as, a, result, of, frictional, effects, associated, with, tidal, deformations, caused, by, earth, with, time, the, energy, of, rotation, of, the, moon, on, its, axis, was, dissipated, as, heat, until, there, was, no, rotation, of, the, moon, relative, to, earth, in, 2016, planetary, scientists, using, data, collected, on, the, 1998, 99, nasa, lunar, prospector, mission, found, two, hydrogen, rich, areas, most, likely, former, water, ice, on, opposite, sides, of, the, moon, it, is, speculated, that, these, patches, were, the, poles, of, the, moon, billions, of, years, ago, before, it, was, tidally, locked, to, earth, half, of, the, moon, s, surface, is, always, illuminated, by, the, sun, except, during, a, lunar, eclipse, earth, also, reflects, light, onto, the, moon, observable, at, times, as, earthlight, when, it, is, reflected, back, to, earth, from, areas, of, the, near, side, of, the, moon, that, are, not, illuminated, by, the, sun, since, the, moon, s, axial, tilt, with, respect, to, the, ecliptic, is, 1, 5427, in, every, draconic, year, 346, 62, days, the, sun, moves, from, being, 1, 5427, north, of, the, lunar, equator, to, being, 1, 5427, south, of, it, and, then, back, just, as, on, earth, the, sun, moves, from, the, tropic, of, cancer, to, the, tropic, of, capricorn, and, back, once, every, tropical, year, the, poles, of, the, moon, are, therefore, in, the, dark, for, half, a, draconic, year, or, with, only, part, of, the, sun, visible, and, then, lit, for, half, a, draconic, year, the, amount, of, sunlight, falling, on, horizontal, areas, near, the, poles, depends, on, the, altitude, angle, of, the, sun, but, these, seasons, have, little, effect, in, more, equatorial, areas, with, the, different, positions, of, the, moon, different, areas, of, it, are, illuminated, by, the, sun, this, illumination, of, different, lunar, areas, as, viewed, from, earth, produces, the, different, lunar, phases, during, the, synodic, month, the, phase, is, equal, to, the, area, of, the, visible, lunar, sphere, that, is, illuminated, by, the, sun, this, area, or, degree, of, illumination, is, given, by, 1, cos, e, 2, sin, 2, e, 2, displaystyle, 1, cos, e, 2, sin, 2, e, 2, where, e, displaystyle, e, is, the, elongation, i, e, the, angle, between, moon, the, observer, on, earth, and, the, sun, brightness, and, apparent, size, of, the, moon, changes, also, due, to, its, elliptic, orbit, around, earth, at, perigee, closest, since, the, moon, is, up, to, 14, closer, to, earth, than, at, apogee, most, distant, it, subtends, a, solid, angle, which, is, up, to, 30, larger, consequently, given, the, same, phase, the, moon, s, brightness, also, varies, by, up, to, 30, between, apogee, and, perigee, a, full, or, new, moon, at, such, a, position, is, called, a, supermoon, there, has, been, historical, controversy, over, whether, observed, features, on, the, moon, s, surface, change, over, time, today, many, of, these, claims, are, thought, to, be, illusory, resulting, from, observation, under, different, lighting, conditions, poor, astronomical, seeing, or, inadequate, drawings, however, outgassing, does, occasionally, occur, and, could, be, responsible, for, a, minor, percentage, of, the, reported, lunar, transient, phenomena, recently, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, roughly, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, diameter, region, of, the, lunar, surface, was, modified, by, a, gas, release, event, about, a, million, years, ago, the, moon, has, an, exceptionally, low, albedo, giving, it, a, reflectance, that, is, slightly, brighter, than, that, of, worn, asphalt, despite, this, it, is, the, brightest, object, in, the, sky, after, the, sun, this, is, due, partly, to, the, brightness, enhancement, of, the, opposition, surge, the, moon, at, quarter, phase, is, only, one, tenth, as, bright, rather, than, half, as, bright, as, at, full, moon, additionally, color, constancy, in, the, visual, system, recalibrates, the, relations, between, the, colors, of, an, object, and, its, surroundings, and, because, the, surrounding, sky, is, comparatively, dark, the, sunlit, moon, is, perceived, as, a, bright, object, the, edges, of, the, full, moon, seem, as, bright, as, the, center, without, limb, darkening, because, of, the, reflective, properties, of, lunar, soil, which, retroreflects, light, more, towards, the, sun, than, in, other, directions, the, moon, s, color, depends, on, the, light, the, moon, reflects, which, in, turn, depends, on, the, moon, s, surface, and, its, features, having, for, example, large, darker, regions, in, general, the, lunar, surface, reflects, a, brown, tinged, gray, light, at, times, the, moon, can, appear, red, or, blue, it, may, appear, red, during, a, lunar, eclipse, because, of, the, red, spectrum, of, the, sun, s, light, being, refracted, onto, the, moon, by, earth, s, atmosphere, because, of, this, red, color, lunar, eclipses, are, also, sometimes, called, blood, moons, the, moon, can, also, seem, red, when, it, appears, at, low, angles, and, through, a, thick, atmosphere, the, moon, may, appear, blue, depending, on, the, presence, of, certain, particles, in, the, air, such, as, volcanic, particles, in, which, case, it, can, be, called, a, blue, moon, because, the, words, red, moon, and, blue, moon, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, specific, full, moons, of, the, year, they, do, not, always, refer, to, the, presence, of, red, or, blue, moonlight, eclipses, only, occur, when, the, sun, earth, and, moon, are, all, in, a, straight, line, termed, syzygy, solar, eclipses, occur, at, new, moon, when, the, moon, is, between, the, sun, and, earth, in, contrast, lunar, eclipses, occur, at, full, moon, when, earth, is, between, the, sun, and, moon, the, apparent, size, of, the, moon, is, roughly, the, same, as, that, of, the, sun, with, both, being, viewed, at, close, to, one, half, a, degree, wide, the, sun, is, much, larger, than, the, moon, but, it, is, the, vastly, greater, distance, that, gives, it, the, same, apparent, size, as, the, much, closer, and, much, smaller, moon, from, the, perspective, of, earth, the, variations, in, apparent, size, due, to, the, non, circular, orbits, are, nearly, the, same, as, well, though, occurring, in, different, cycles, this, makes, possible, both, total, with, the, moon, appearing, larger, than, the, sun, and, annular, with, the, moon, appearing, smaller, than, the, sun, solar, eclipses, in, a, total, eclipse, the, moon, completely, covers, the, disc, of, the, sun, and, the, solar, corona, becomes, visible, to, the, naked, eye, because, the, distance, between, the, moon, and, earth, is, very, slowly, increasing, over, time, the, angular, diameter, of, the, moon, is, decreasing, as, it, evolves, toward, becoming, a, red, giant, the, size, of, the, sun, and, its, apparent, diameter, in, the, sky, are, slowly, increasing, the, combination, of, these, two, changes, means, that, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, ago, the, moon, would, always, completely, cover, the, sun, on, solar, eclipses, and, no, annular, eclipses, were, possible, likewise, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, in, the, future, the, moon, will, no, longer, cover, the, sun, completely, and, total, solar, eclipses, will, not, occur, as, the, moon, s, orbit, around, earth, is, inclined, by, about, 5, 145, 5, 9, to, the, orbit, of, earth, around, the, sun, eclipses, do, not, occur, at, every, full, and, new, moon, for, an, eclipse, to, occur, the, moon, must, be, near, the, intersection, of, the, two, orbital, planes, the, periodicity, and, recurrence, of, eclipses, of, the, sun, by, the, moon, and, of, the, moon, by, earth, is, described, by, the, saros, which, has, a, period, of, approximately, 18, years, because, the, moon, continuously, blocks, the, view, of, a, half, degree, wide, circular, area, of, the, sky, the, related, phenomenon, of, occultation, occurs, when, a, bright, star, or, planet, passes, behind, the, moon, and, is, occulted, hidden, from, view, in, this, way, a, solar, eclipse, is, an, occultation, of, the, sun, because, the, moon, is, comparatively, close, to, earth, occultations, of, individual, stars, are, not, visible, everywhere, on, the, planet, nor, at, the, same, time, because, of, the, precession, of, the, lunar, orbit, each, year, different, stars, are, occulted, it, is, believed, by, some, that, the, oldest, cave, paintings, from, up, to, 40, 000, bp, of, bulls, and, geometric, shapes, or, 20, 30, 000, year, old, tally, sticks, were, used, to, observe, the, phases, of, the, moon, keeping, time, using, the, waxing, and, waning, of, the, moon, s, phases, one, of, the, earliest, discovered, possible, depictions, of, the, moon, is, a, 3, 000, bce, rock, carving, orthostat, 47, at, knowth, ireland, with, the, nebra, sky, disc, from, c, 1800, 1600, bce, being, another, depiction, identified, as, the, oldest, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, anaxagoras, d, 428, bc, reasoned, that, the, sun, and, moon, were, both, giant, spherical, rocks, and, that, the, latter, reflected, the, light, of, the, former, 227, elsewhere, in, the, 5th, century, bc, to, 4th, century, bc, babylonian, astronomers, had, recorded, the, 18, year, saros, cycle, of, lunar, eclipses, and, indian, astronomers, had, described, the, moon, s, monthly, elongation, the, chinese, astronomer, shi, shen, fl, 4th, century, bc, gave, instructions, for, predicting, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, 411, in, aristotle, s, 384, 322, bc, description, of, the, universe, the, moon, marked, the, boundary, between, the, spheres, of, the, mutable, elements, earth, water, air, and, fire, and, the, imperishable, stars, of, aether, an, influential, philosophy, that, would, dominate, for, centuries, archimedes, 287, 212, bc, designed, a, planetarium, that, could, calculate, the, motions, of, the, moon, and, other, objects, in, the, solar, system, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, seleucus, of, seleucia, correctly, thought, that, tides, were, due, to, the, attraction, of, the, moon, and, that, their, height, depends, on, the, moon, s, position, relative, to, the, sun, in, the, same, century, aristarchus, computed, the, size, and, distance, of, the, moon, from, earth, obtaining, a, value, of, about, twenty, times, the, radius, of, earth, for, the, distance, the, chinese, of, the, han, dynasty, believed, the, moon, to, be, energy, equated, to, qi, and, their, radiating, influence, theory, recognized, that, the, light, of, the, moon, was, merely, a, reflection, of, the, sun, jing, fang, 78, 37, bc, noted, the, sphericity, of, the, moon, 413, 414, ptolemy, 90, 168, ad, greatly, improved, on, the, numbers, of, aristarchus, calculating, a, mean, distance, of, 59, times, earth, s, radius, and, a, diameter, of, 0, 292, earth, diameters, close, to, the, correct, values, of, about, 60, and, 0, 273, respectively, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, lucian, wrote, the, novel, a, true, story, in, which, the, heroes, travel, to, the, moon, and, meet, its, inhabitants, in, 510, ad, the, indian, astronomer, aryabhata, mentioned, in, his, aryabhatiya, that, reflected, sunlight, is, the, cause, of, the, shining, of, the, moon, the, astronomer, and, physicist, ibn, al, haytham, 965, 1039, found, that, sunlight, was, not, reflected, from, the, moon, like, a, mirror, but, that, light, was, emitted, from, every, part, of, the, moon, s, sunlit, surface, in, all, directions, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, of, the, song, dynasty, created, an, allegory, equating, the, waxing, and, waning, of, the, moon, to, a, round, ball, of, reflective, silver, that, when, doused, with, white, powder, and, viewed, from, the, side, would, appear, to, be, a, crescent, 415, 416, during, the, middle, ages, before, the, invention, of, the, telescope, the, moon, was, increasingly, recognized, as, a, sphere, though, many, believed, that, it, was, perfectly, smooth, in, 1609, galileo, galilei, used, an, early, telescope, to, make, drawings, of, the, moon, for, his, book, sidereus, nuncius, and, deduced, that, it, was, not, smooth, but, had, mountains, and, craters, thomas, harriot, had, made, but, not, published, such, drawings, a, few, months, earlier, telescopic, mapping, of, the, moon, followed, later, in, the, 17th, century, the, efforts, of, giovanni, battista, riccioli, and, francesco, maria, grimaldi, led, to, the, system, of, naming, of, lunar, features, in, use, today, the, more, exact, 1834, 1836, mappa, selenographica, of, wilhelm, beer, and, johann, heinrich, von, m, dler, and, their, associated, 1837, book, der, mond, the, first, trigonometrically, accurate, study, of, lunar, features, included, the, heights, of, more, than, a, thousand, mountains, and, introduced, the, study, of, the, moon, at, accuracies, possible, in, earthly, geography, lunar, craters, first, noted, by, galileo, were, thought, to, be, volcanic, until, the, 1870s, proposal, of, richard, proctor, that, they, were, formed, by, collisions, this, view, gained, support, in, 1892, from, the, experimentation, of, geologist, grove, karl, gilbert, and, from, comparative, studies, from, 1920, to, the, 1940s, leading, to, the, development, of, lunar, stratigraphy, which, by, the, 1950s, was, becoming, a, new, and, growing, branch, of, astrogeology, after, world, war, ii, the, first, launch, systems, were, developed, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, they, reached, capabilities, that, allowed, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, to, launch, spacecraft, into, space, the, cold, war, fueled, a, closely, followed, development, of, launch, systems, by, the, two, states, resulting, in, the, so, called, space, race, and, its, later, phase, the, moon, race, accelerating, efforts, and, interest, in, exploration, of, the, moon, after, the, first, spaceflight, of, sputnik, 1, in, 1957, during, international, geophysical, year, the, spacecraft, of, the, soviet, union, s, luna, program, were, the, first, to, accomplish, a, number, of, goals, following, three, unnamed, failed, missions, in, 1958, the, first, human, made, object, luna, 1, escaped, earth, s, gravity, and, passed, near, the, moon, in, 1959, later, that, year, the, first, human, made, object, luna, 2, reached, the, moon, s, surface, by, intentionally, impacting, by, the, end, of, the, year, luna, 3, reached, as, the, first, human, made, object, the, normally, occluded, far, side, of, the, moon, taking, the, first, photographs, of, it, the, first, spacecraft, to, perform, a, successful, lunar, soft, landing, was, luna, 9, and, the, first, vehicle, to, orbit, the, moon, was, luna, 10, both, in, 1966, following, president, john, f, kennedy, s, 1961, commitment, to, a, crewed, moon, landing, before, the, end, of, the, decade, the, united, states, under, nasa, leadership, launched, a, series, of, uncrewed, probes, to, develop, an, understanding, of, the, lunar, surface, in, preparation, for, human, missions, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, s, ranger, program, the, lunar, orbiter, program, and, the, surveyor, program, the, crewed, apollo, program, was, developed, in, parallel, after, a, series, of, uncrewed, and, crewed, tests, of, the, apollo, spacecraft, in, earth, orbit, and, spurred, on, by, a, potential, soviet, lunar, human, landing, in, 1968, apollo, 8, made, the, first, human, mission, to, lunar, orbit, the, first, earthlings, two, tortoises, had, circled, the, moon, three, months, earlier, on, the, soviet, union, s, zond, 5, followed, by, turtles, on, zond, 6, the, first, time, a, person, landed, on, the, moon, and, any, extraterrestrial, body, was, when, neil, armstrong, the, commander, of, the, american, mission, apollo, 11, set, foot, on, the, moon, at, 02, 56, utc, on, july, 21, 1969, considered, the, culmination, of, the, space, race, an, estimated, 500, million, people, worldwide, watched, the, transmission, by, the, apollo, tv, camera, the, largest, television, audience, for, a, live, broadcast, at, that, time, while, at, the, same, time, another, mission, the, robotic, sample, return, mission, luna, 15, by, the, soviet, union, had, been, in, orbit, around, the, moon, becoming, together, with, apollo, 11, the, first, ever, case, of, two, extraterrestrial, missions, being, conducted, at, the, same, time, the, apollo, missions, 11, to, 17, except, apollo, 13, which, aborted, its, planned, lunar, landing, removed, 380, 05, kilograms, 837, 87, lb, of, lunar, rock, and, soil, in, 2, 196, separate, samples, scientific, instrument, packages, were, installed, on, the, lunar, surface, during, all, the, apollo, landings, long, lived, instrument, stations, including, heat, flow, probes, seismometers, and, magnetometers, were, installed, at, the, apollo, 12, 14, 15, 16, and, 17, landing, sites, direct, transmission, of, data, to, earth, concluded, in, late, 1977, because, of, budgetary, considerations, but, as, the, stations, lunar, laser, ranging, corner, cube, retroreflector, arrays, are, passive, instruments, they, are, still, being, used, apollo, 17, in, 1972, remains, the, last, crewed, mission, to, the, moon, explorer, 49, in, 1973, was, the, last, dedicated, u, s, probe, to, the, moon, until, the, 1990s, the, soviet, union, continued, sending, robotic, missions, to, the, moon, until, 1976, deploying, in, 1970, with, luna, 17, the, first, remote, controlled, rover, lunokhod, 1, on, an, extraterrestrial, surface, and, collecting, and, returning, 0, 3, kg, of, rock, and, soil, samples, with, three, luna, sample, return, missions, luna, 16, in, 1970, luna, 20, in, 1972, and, luna, 24, in, 1976, a, near, lunar, quietude, of, fourteen, years, followed, the, last, soviet, mission, to, the, moon, of, 1976, astronautics, had, shifted, its, focus, towards, the, exploration, of, the, inner, e, g, venera, program, and, outer, e, g, pioneer, 10, 1972, solar, system, planets, but, also, towards, earth, orbit, developing, and, continuously, operating, beside, communication, satellites, earth, observation, satellites, e, g, landsat, program, 1972, space, telescopes, and, particularly, space, stations, e, g, salyut, program, 1971, the, until, 1979, negotiated, moon, treaty, with, its, ratification, in, 1984, by, its, few, signatories, was, about, the, only, major, activity, regarding, the, moon, until, 1990, in, 1990, hiten, hagoromo, the, first, dedicated, lunar, mission, since, 1976, reached, the, moon, sent, by, japan, it, became, the, first, mission, that, was, not, a, soviet, union, or, u, s, mission, to, the, moon, in, 1994, the, u, s, dedicated, a, mission, to, fly, a, spacecraft, clementine, to, the, moon, again, for, the, first, time, since, 1973, this, mission, obtained, the, first, near, global, topographic, map, of, the, moon, and, the, first, global, multispectral, images, of, the, lunar, surface, in, 1998, this, was, followed, by, the, lunar, prospector, mission, whose, instruments, indicated, the, presence, of, excess, hydrogen, at, the, lunar, poles, which, is, likely, to, have, been, caused, by, the, presence, of, water, ice, in, the, upper, few, meters, of, the, regolith, within, permanently, shadowed, craters, the, next, years, saw, a, row, of, first, missions, to, the, moon, by, a, new, group, of, states, actively, exploring, the, moon, between, 2004, and, 2006, the, first, spacecraft, by, the, european, space, agency, esa, smart, 1, reached, the, moon, recording, the, first, detailed, survey, of, chemical, elements, on, the, lunar, surface, the, chinese, lunar, exploration, program, reached, the, moon, for, the, first, time, with, the, orbiter, chang, e, 1, 2007, 2009, obtaining, a, full, image, map, of, the, moon, india, reached, orbited, and, impacted, the, moon, in, 2008, for, the, first, time, with, its, chandrayaan, 1, and, moon, impact, probe, becoming, the, fifth, and, sixth, state, to, do, so, creating, a, high, resolution, chemical, mineralogical, and, photo, geological, map, of, the, lunar, surface, and, confirming, the, presence, of, water, molecules, in, lunar, soil, the, u, s, launched, the, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, lro, and, the, lcross, impactor, on, june, 18, 2009, lcross, completed, its, mission, by, making, a, planned, and, widely, observed, impact, in, the, crater, cabeus, on, october, 9, 2009, whereas, lro, is, currently, in, operation, obtaining, precise, lunar, altimetry, and, high, resolution, imagery, china, continued, its, lunar, program, in, 2010, with, chang, e, 2, mapping, the, surface, at, a, higher, resolution, over, an, eight, month, period, and, in, 2013, with, chang, e, 3, a, lunar, lander, along, with, a, lunar, rover, named, yutu, chinese, lit, jade, rabbit, this, was, the, first, lunar, rover, mission, since, lunokhod, 2, in, 1973, and, the, first, lunar, soft, landing, since, luna, 24, in, 1976, making, china, the, third, country, to, achieve, this, in, 2014, the, first, privately, funded, probe, the, manfred, memorial, moon, mission, reached, the, moon, another, chinese, rover, mission, chang, e, 4, achieved, the, first, landing, on, the, moon, s, far, side, in, early, 2019, also, in, 2019, india, successfully, sent, its, second, probe, chandrayaan, 2, to, the, moon, in, 2020, china, carried, out, its, first, robotic, sample, return, mission, chang, e, 5, bringing, back, 1, 731, grams, of, lunar, material, to, earth, the, u, s, developed, plans, for, returning, to, the, moon, beginning, in, 2004, and, with, the, signing, of, the, u, s, led, artemis, accords, in, 2020, the, artemis, program, aims, to, return, the, astronauts, to, the, moon, in, the, 2020s, the, accords, have, been, joined, by, a, growing, number, of, countries, the, introduction, of, the, artemis, accords, has, fueled, a, renewed, discussion, about, the, international, framework, and, cooperation, of, lunar, activity, building, on, the, moon, treaty, and, the, esa, led, moon, village, concept, 2023, and, 2024, india, and, japan, became, the, fourth, and, fifth, country, to, soft, land, a, spacecraft, on, the, moon, following, the, soviet, union, and, united, states, in, the, 1960s, and, china, in, the, 2010s, notably, japan, s, spacecraft, the, smart,

on, may, 3, 2024, which, conducted, another, lunar, sample, return, from, the, far, side, of, the, moon, it, also, carried, a, chinese, rover, to, conduct, infrared, spectroscopy, of, lunar, surface, pakistan, sent, a, lunar, orbiter, called, icube, q, along, with, chang, e, 6, nova, c, 2, ispace, lander, and, blue, ghost, are, all, planned, to, launch, to, the, moon, in, 2024, beside, the, progressing, artemis, program, and, supporting, commercial, lunar, payload, services, leading, an, international, and, commercial, crewed, opening, up, of, the, moon, and, sending, the, first, woman, person, of, color, and, non, us, citizen, to, the, moon, in, the, 2020s, china, is, continuing, its, ambitious, chang, e, program, having, announced, with, russia, s, struggling, luna, glob, program, joint, missions, both, the, chinese, and, us, lunar, programs, have, the, goal, to, establish, in, the, 2030s, a, lunar, base, with, their, international, partners, though, the, us, and, its, partners, will, first, establish, an, orbital, lunar, gateway, station, in, the, 2020s, from, which, artemis, missions, will, land, the, human, landing, system, to, set, up, temporary, surface, camps, while, the, apollo, missions, were, explorational, in, nature, the, artemis, program, plans, to, establish, a, more, permanent, presence, to, this, end, nasa, is, partnering, with, industry, leaders, to, establish, key, elements, such, as, modern, communication, infrastructure, a, 4g, connectivity, demonstration, is, to, be, launched, aboard, an, intuitive, machines, nova, c, lander, in, 2024, another, focus, is, on, in, situ, resource, utilization, which, is, a, key, part, of, the, darpa, lunar, programs, darpa, has, requested, that, industry, partners, develop, a, 10, year, lunar, architecture, plan, to, enable, the, beginning, of, a, lunar, economy, humans, last, landed, on, the, moon, during, the, apollo, program, a, series, of, crewed, exploration, missions, carried, out, from, 1969, to, 1972, lunar, orbit, has, seen, uninterrupted, presence, of, orbiters, since, 2006, performing, mainly, lunar, observation, and, providing, relayed, communication, for, robotic, missions, on, the, lunar, surface, lunar, orbits, and, orbits, around, earth, moon, lagrange, points, are, used, to, establish, a, near, lunar, infrastructure, to, enable, increasing, human, activity, in, cislunar, space, as, well, as, on, the, moon, s, surface, missions, at, the, far, side, of, the, moon, or, the, lunar, north, and, south, polar, regions, need, spacecraft, with, special, orbits, such, as, the, queqiao, and, queqiao, 2, relay, satellite, or, the, planned, first, extraterrestrial, space, station, the, lunar, gateway, while, the, moon, has, the, lowest, planetary, protection, target, categorization, its, degradation, as, a, pristine, body, and, scientific, place, has, been, discussed, if, there, is, astronomy, performed, from, the, moon, it, will, need, to, be, free, from, any, physical, and, radio, pollution, while, the, moon, has, no, significant, atmosphere, traffic, and, impacts, on, the, moon, causes, clouds, of, dust, that, can, spread, far, and, possibly, contaminate, the, original, state, of, the, moon, and, its, special, scientific, content, scholar, alice, gorman, asserts, that, although, the, moon, is, inhospitable, it, is, not, dead, and, that, sustainable, human, activity, would, require, treating, the, moon, s, ecology, as, a, co, participant, the, so, called, tardigrade, affair, of, the, 2019, crashed, beresheet, lander, and, its, carrying, of, tardigrades, has, been, discussed, as, an, example, for, lacking, measures, and, lacking, international, regulation, for, planetary, protection, space, debris, beyond, earth, around, the, moon, has, been, considered, as, a, future, challenge, with, increasing, numbers, of, missions, to, the, moon, particularly, as, a, danger, for, such, missions, as, such, lunar, waste, management, has, been, raised, as, an, issue, which, future, lunar, missions, particularly, on, the, surface, need, to, tackle, human, remains, have, been, transported, to, the, moon, including, by, private, companies, such, as, celestis, and, elysium, space, because, the, moon, has, been, sacred, or, significant, to, many, cultures, the, practice, of, space, burials, have, attracted, criticism, from, indigenous, peoples, leaders, for, example, then, navajo, nation, president, albert, hale, criticized, nasa, for, sending, the, cremated, ashes, of, scientist, eugene, shoemaker, to, the, moon, in, 1998, beside, the, remains, of, human, activity, on, the, moon, there, have, been, some, intended, permanent, installations, like, the, moon, museum, art, piece, apollo, 11, goodwill, messages, six, lunar, plaques, the, fallen, astronaut, memorial, and, other, artifacts, longterm, missions, continuing, to, be, active, are, some, orbiters, such, as, the, 2009, launched, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, surveilling, the, moon, for, future, missions, as, well, as, some, landers, such, as, the, 2013, launched, chang, e, 3, with, its, lunar, ultraviolet, telescope, still, operational, five, retroreflectors, have, been, installed, on, the, moon, since, the, 1970s, and, since, used, for, accurate, measurements, of, the, physical, librations, through, laser, ranging, to, the, moon, there, are, several, missions, by, different, agencies, and, companies, planned, to, establish, a, longterm, human, presence, on, the, moon, with, the, lunar, gateway, as, the, currently, most, advanced, project, as, part, of, the, artemis, program, the, moon, is, recognized, as, an, excellent, site, for, telescopes, it, is, relatively, nearby, certain, craters, near, the, poles, are, permanently, dark, and, cold, and, especially, useful, for, infrared, telescopes, and, radio, telescopes, on, the, far, side, would, be, shielded, from, the, radio, chatter, of, earth, the, lunar, soil, although, it, poses, a, problem, for, any, moving, parts, of, telescopes, can, be, mixed, with, carbon, nanotubes, and, epoxies, and, employed, in, the, construction, of, mirrors, up, to, 50, meters, in, diameter, a, lunar, zenith, telescope, can, be, made, cheaply, with, an, ionic, liquid, in, april, 1972, the, apollo, 16, mission, recorded, various, astronomical, photos, and, spectra, in, ultraviolet, with, the, far, ultraviolet, camera, spectrograph, the, moon, has, been, also, a, site, of, earth, observation, particularly, culturally, as, in, the, 1968, photograph, called, earthrise, taken, by, bill, anders, of, apollo, 8, the, earth, appears, in, the, moon, s, sky, with, an, apparent, size, of, 1, 48, to, 2, three, to, four, times, the, size, of, the, moon, or, sun, in, earth, s, sky, or, about, the, apparent, width, of, two, little, fingers, at, an, arm, s, length, away, the, only, instances, of, humans, living, on, the, moon, have, taken, place, in, an, apollo, lunar, module, for, several, days, at, a, time, for, example, during, the, apollo, 17, mission, one, challenge, to, astronauts, during, their, stay, on, the, surface, is, that, lunar, dust, sticks, to, their, suits, and, is, carried, into, their, quarters, astronauts, could, taste, and, smell, the, dust, which, smells, like, gunpowder, and, was, called, the, apollo, aroma, this, fine, lunar, dust, can, cause, health, issues, in, 2019, at, least, one, plant, seed, sprouted, in, an, experiment, on, the, chang, e, 4, lander, it, was, carried, from, earth, along, with, other, small, life, in, its, lunar, micro, ecosystem, although, luna, landers, scattered, pennants, of, the, soviet, union, on, the, moon, and, u, s, flags, were, symbolically, planted, at, their, landing, sites, by, the, apollo, astronauts, no, nation, claims, ownership, of, any, part, of, the, moon, s, surface, likewise, no, private, ownership, of, parts, of, the, moon, or, as, a, whole, is, considered, credible, the, 1967, outer, space, treaty, defines, the, moon, and, all, outer, space, as, the, province, of, all, mankind, it, restricts, the, use, of, the, moon, to, peaceful, purposes, explicitly, banning, military, installations, and, weapons, of, mass, destruction, a, majority, of, countries, are, parties, of, this, treaty, the, 1979, moon, agreement, was, created, to, elaborate, and, restrict, the, exploitation, of, the, moon, s, resources, by, any, single, nation, leaving, it, to, a, yet, unspecified, international, regulatory, regime, as, of, january, 2020, it, has, been, signed, and, ratified, by, 18, nations, none, of, which, have, human, spaceflight, capabilities, since, 2020, countries, have, joined, the, u, s, in, their, artemis, accords, which, are, challenging, the, treaty, the, u, s, has, furthermore, emphasized, in, a, presidential, executive, order, encouraging, international, support, for, the, recovery, and, use, of, space, resources, that, the, united, states, does, not, view, outer, space, as, a, global, commons, and, calls, the, moon, agreement, a, failed, attempt, at, constraining, free, enterprise, with, australia, signing, and, ratifying, both, the, moon, treaty, in, 1986, as, well, as, the, artemis, accords, in, 2020, there, has, been, a, discussion, if, they, can, be, harmonized, in, this, light, an, implementation, agreement, for, the, moon, treaty, has, been, advocated, for, as, a, way, to, compensate, for, the, shortcomings, of, the, moon, treaty, and, to, harmonize, it, with, other, laws, and, agreements, such, as, the, artemis, accords, allowing, it, to, be, more, widely, accepted, in, the, face, of, such, increasing, commercial, and, national, interest, particularly, prospecting, territories, u, s, lawmakers, have, introduced, in, late, 2020, specific, regulation, for, the, conservation, of, historic, landing, sites, and, interest, groups, have, argued, for, making, such, sites, world, heritage, sites, and, zones, of, scientific, value, protected, zones, all, of, which, add, to, the, legal, availability, and, territorialization, of, the, moon, in, 2021, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, the, moon, was, created, by, a, group, of, lawyers, space, archaeologists, and, concerned, citizens, drawing, on, precedents, in, the, rights, of, nature, movement, and, the, concept, of, legal, personality, for, non, human, entities, in, space, increasing, human, activity, at, the, moon, has, raised, the, need, for, coordination, to, safeguard, international, and, commercial, lunar, activity, issues, from, cooperation, to, mere, coordination, through, for, example, the, development, of, a, shared, lunar, time, have, been, raised, in, particular, the, establishment, of, an, international, or, united, nations, regulatory, regime, for, lunar, human, activity, has, been, called, for, by, the, moon, treaty, and, suggested, through, an, implementation, agreement, but, remains, contentious, current, lunar, programs, are, multilateral, with, the, us, led, artemis, program, and, the, china, led, international, lunar, research, station, for, broader, international, cooperation, and, coordination, the, international, lunar, exploration, working, group, ilewg, the, moon, village, association, mva, and, more, generally, the, international, space, exploration, coordination, group, isecg, has, been, established, since, pre, historic, times, people, have, taken, note, of, the, moon, s, phases, and, its, waxing, and, waning, cycle, and, used, it, to, keep, record, of, time, tally, sticks, notched, bones, dating, as, far, back, as, 20, 30, 000, years, ago, are, believed, by, some, to, mark, the, phases, of, the, moon, the, counting, of, the, days, between, the, moon, s, phases, gave, eventually, rise, to, generalized, time, periods, of, lunar, cycles, as, months, and, possibly, of, its, phases, as, weeks, the, words, for, the, month, in, a, range, of, different, languages, carry, this, relation, between, the, period, of, the, month, and, the, moon, etymologically, the, english, month, as, well, as, moon, and, its, cognates, in, other, indo, european, languages, e, g, the, latin, mensis, and, ancient, greek, meis, or, m, n, meaning, month, stem, from, the, proto, indo, european, pie, root, of, moon, m, h, 1, n, t, derived, from, the, pie, verbal, root, meh, 1, to, measure, indicat, a, functional, conception, of, the, moon, i, e, marker, of, the, month, cf, the, english, words, measure, and, menstrual, to, give, another, example, from, a, different, language, family, the, chinese, language, uses, the, same, word, for, moon, as, well, as, for, month, which, furthermore, can, be, found, in, the, symbols, for, the, word, week, this, lunar, timekeeping, gave, rise, to, the, historically, dominant, but, varied, lunisolar, calendars, the, 7th, century, islamic, calendar, is, an, example, of, a, purely, lunar, calendar, where, months, are, traditionally, determined, by, the, visual, sighting, of, the, hilal, or, earliest, crescent, moon, over, the, horizon, of, particular, significance, has, been, the, occasion, of, full, moon, highlighted, and, celebrated, in, a, range, of, calendars, and, cultures, an, example, being, the, buddhist, vesak, the, full, moon, around, the, southern, or, northern, autumnal, equinox, is, often, called, the, harvest, moon, and, is, celebrated, with, festivities, such, as, the, harvest, moon, festival, of, the, chinese, lunar, calendar, its, second, most, important, celebration, after, the, chinese, lunisolar, lunar, new, year, furthermore, association, of, time, with, the, moon, can, also, be, found, in, religion, such, as, the, ancient, egyptian, temporal, and, lunar, deity, khonsu, since, prehistoric, times, humans, have, depicted, and, later, described, their, perception, of, the, moon, and, its, importance, for, them, and, their, cosmologies, it, has, been, characterized, and, associated, in, many, different, ways, from, having, a, spirit, or, being, a, deity, and, an, aspect, thereof, or, an, aspect, in, astrology, for, the, representation, of, the, moon, especially, its, lunar, phases, the, crescent, has, been, a, recurring, symbol, in, a, range, of, cultures, since, at, least, 3, 000, bce, nebra, sky, disc, or, possibly, earlier, with, bull, horns, dating, to, the, earliest, cave, paintings, at, 40, 000, bp, in, writing, systems, such, as, chinese, the, crescent, has, developed, into, the, symbol, the, word, for, moon, and, in, ancient, egyptian, it, was, the, symbol, meaning, moon, and, spelled, like, the, ancient, egyptian, lunar, deity, iah, which, the, other, ancient, egyptian, lunar, deities, khonsu, and, thoth, were, associated, with, iconographically, the, crescent, was, used, in, mesopotamia, as, the, primary, symbol, of, nanna, s, n, the, ancient, sumerian, lunar, deity, who, was, the, father, of, inanna, ishtar, the, goddess, of, the, planet, venus, symbolized, as, the, eight, pointed, star, of, ishtar, and, utu, shamash, the, god, of, the, sun, symbolized, as, a, disc, optionally, with, eight, rays, all, three, often, depicted, next, to, each, other, nanna, s, n, is, like, some, other, lunar, deities, for, example, iah, and, khonsu, of, ancient, egypt, mene, selene, of, ancient, greece, and, luna, of, ancient, rome, depicted, as, a, horned, deity, featuring, crescent, shaped, headgears, or, crowns, the, particular, arrangement, of, the, crescent, with, a, star, known, as, the, star, and, crescent, goes, back, to, the, bronze, age, representing, either, the, sun, and, moon, or, the, moon, and, the, planet, venus, in, combination, it, came, to, represent, the, selene, goddess, artemis, and, via, the, patronage, of, hecate, which, as, triple, deity, under, the, epithet, trimorphos, trivia, included, aspects, of, artemis, diana, came, to, be, used, as, a, symbol, of, byzantium, with, virgin, mary, queen, of, heaven, later, taking, her, place, becoming, depicted, in, marian, veneration, on, a, crescent, and, adorned, with, stars, since, then, the, heraldric, use, of, the, star, and, crescent, proliferated, byzantium, s, symbolism, possibly, influencing, the, development, of, the, ottoman, flag, specifically, the, combination, of, the, turkish, crescent, with, a, star, and, becoming, a, popular, symbol, for, islam, as, the, hilal, of, the, islamic, calendar, and, for, a, range, of, nations, the, features, of, the, moon, the, contrasting, brighter, highlands, and, darker, maria, have, been, seen, by, different, cultures, forming, abstract, shapes, such, shapes, are, among, others, the, man, in, the, moon, e, g, coyolx, uhqui, or, the, moon, rabbit, e, g, the, chinese, tu, er, ye, or, in, indigenous, american, mythologies, the, aspect, of, the, mayan, moon, goddess, from, which, possibly, awilix, is, derived, or, of, metztli, t, ccizt, catl, occasionally, some, lunar, deities, have, been, also, depicted, driving, a, chariot, across, the, sky, such, as, the, hindu, chandra, soma, the, greek, artemis, which, is, associated, with, selene, or, luna, selene, s, ancient, roman, equivalent, color, and, material, wise, the, moon, has, been, associated, in, western, alchemy, with, silver, while, gold, is, associated, with, the, sun, through, a, miracle, the, so, called, splitting, of, the, moon, arabic, in, islam, association, with, the, moon, applies, also, to, muhammad, the, perception, of, the, moon, in, modern, times, has, been, informed, by, telescope, enabled, modern, astronomy, and, later, by, spaceflight, enabled, actual, human, activity, at, the, moon, particularly, the, culturally, impactful, lunar, landings, these, new, insights, inspired, cultural, references, connecting, romantic, reflections, about, the, moon, and, speculative, fiction, such, as, science, fiction, dealing, with, the, moon, contemporarily, the, moon, has, been, seen, as, a, place, for, economic, expansion, into, space, with, missions, prospecting, for, lunar, resources, this, has, been, accompanied, with, renewed, public, and, critical, reflection, on, humanity, s, cultural, and, legal, relation, to, the, celestial, body, especially, regarding, colonialism, as, in, the, 1970, poem, whitey, on, the, moon, in, this, light, the, moon, s, nature, has, been, invoked, particularly, for, lunar, conservation, and, as, a, common, in, 2021, 20, july, the, date, of, the, first, crewed, moon, landing, became, the, annual, international, moon, day, the, lunar, effect, is, a, purported, unproven, correlation, between, specific, stages, of, the, roughly, 29, 5, day, lunar, cycle, and, behavior, and, physiological, changes, in, living, beings, on, earth, including, humans, the, moon, has, long, been, associated, with, insanity, and, irrationality, the, words, lunacy, and, lunatic, are, derived, from, the, latin, name, for, the, moon, luna, philosophers,
