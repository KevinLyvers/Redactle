iron, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, the, symbol, fe, from, latin, ferrum, iron, and, atomic, number, 26, it, is, a, metal, that, belongs, to, the, first, transition, series, and, group, 8, of, the, periodic, table, it, is, by, mass, the, most, common, element, on, earth, forming, much, of, earth, s, outer, and, inner, core, it, is, the, fourth, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, being, mainly, deposited, by, meteorites, in, its, metallic, state, extracting, usable, metal, from, iron, ores, requires, kilns, or, furnaces, capable, of, reaching, 1, 500, c, 2, 730, f, about, 500, c, 932, f, higher, than, that, required, to, smelt, copper, humans, started, to, master, that, process, in, eurasia, during, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, and, the, use, of, iron, tools, and, weapons, began, to, displace, copper, alloys, in, some, regions, only, around, 1200, bc, that, event, is, considered, the, transition, from, the, bronze, age, to, the, iron, age, in, the, modern, world, iron, alloys, such, as, steel, stainless, steel, cast, iron, and, special, steels, are, by, far, the, most, common, industrial, metals, due, to, their, mechanical, properties, and, low, cost, the, iron, and, steel, industry, is, thus, very, important, economically, and, iron, is, the, cheapest, metal, with, a, price, of, a, few, dollars, per, kilogram, or, pound, pristine, and, smooth, pure, iron, surfaces, are, a, mirror, like, silvery, gray, iron, reacts, readily, with, oxygen, and, water, to, produce, brown, to, black, hydrated, iron, oxides, commonly, known, as, rust, unlike, the, oxides, of, some, other, metals, that, form, passivating, layers, rust, occupies, more, volume, than, the, metal, and, thus, flakes, off, exposing, more, fresh, surfaces, for, corrosion, chemically, the, most, common, oxidation, states, of, iron, are, iron, ii, and, iron, iii, iron, shares, many, properties, of, other, transition, metals, including, the, other, group, 8, elements, ruthenium, and, osmium, iron, forms, compounds, in, a, wide, range, of, oxidation, states, 4, to, 7, iron, also, forms, many, coordination, compounds, some, of, them, such, as, ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and, prussian, blue, have, substantial, industrial, medical, or, research, applications, the, body, of, an, adult, human, contains, about, 4, grams, 0, 005, body, weight, of, iron, mostly, in, hemoglobin, and, myoglobin, these, two, proteins, play, essential, roles, in, oxygen, transport, by, blood, and, oxygen, storage, in, muscles, to, maintain, the, necessary, levels, human, iron, metabolism, requires, a, minimum, of, iron, in, the, diet, iron, is, also, the, metal, at, the, active, site, of, many, important, redox, enzymes, dealing, with, cellular, respiration, and, oxidation, and, reduction, in, plants, and, animals, at, least, four, allotropes, of, iron, differing, atom, arrangements, in, the, solid, are, known, conventionally, denoted, and, the, first, three, forms, are, observed, at, ordinary, pressures, as, molten, iron, cools, past, its, freezing, point, of, 1538, c, it, crystallizes, into, its, allotrope, which, has, a, body, centered, cubic, bcc, crystal, structure, as, it, cools, further, to, 1394, c, it, changes, to, its, iron, allotrope, a, face, centered, cubic, fcc, crystal, structure, or, austenite, at, 912, c, and, below, the, crystal, structure, again, becomes, the, bcc, iron, allotrope, the, physical, properties, of, iron, at, very, high, pressures, and, temperatures, have, also, been, studied, extensively, because, of, their, relevance, to, theories, about, the, cores, of, the, earth, and, other, planets, above, approximately, 10, gpa, and, temperatures, of, a, few, hundred, kelvin, or, less, iron, changes, into, another, hexagonal, close, packed, hcp, structure, which, is, also, known, as, iron, the, higher, temperature, phase, also, changes, into, iron, but, does, so, at, higher, pressure, some, controversial, experimental, evidence, exists, for, a, stable, phase, at, pressures, above, 50, gpa, and, temperatures, of, at, least, 1500, k, it, is, supposed, to, have, an, orthorhombic, or, a, double, hcp, structure, confusingly, the, term, iron, is, sometimes, also, used, to, refer, to, iron, above, its, curie, point, when, it, changes, from, being, ferromagnetic, to, paramagnetic, even, though, its, crystal, structure, has, not, changed, the, inner, core, of, the, earth, is, generally, presumed, to, consist, of, an, iron, nickel, alloy, with, or, structure, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, iron, along, with, its, enthalpy, of, atomization, are, lower, than, those, of, the, earlier, 3d, elements, from, scandium, to, chromium, showing, the, lessened, contribution, of, the, 3d, electrons, to, metallic, bonding, as, they, are, attracted, more, and, more, into, the, inert, core, by, the, nucleus, however, they, are, higher, than, the, values, for, the, previous, element, manganese, because, that, element, has, a, half, filled, 3d, sub, shell, and, consequently, its, d, electrons, are, not, easily, delocalized, this, same, trend, appears, for, ruthenium, but, not, osmium, the, melting, point, of, iron, is, experimentally, well, defined, for, pressures, less, than, 50, gpa, for, greater, pressures, published, data, as, of, 2007, still, varies, by, tens, of, gigapascals, and, over, a, thousand, kelvin, below, its, curie, point, of, 770, c, 1, 420, f, 1, 040, k, iron, changes, from, paramagnetic, to, ferromagnetic, the, spins, of, the, two, unpaired, electrons, in, each, atom, generally, align, with, the, spins, of, its, neighbors, creating, an, overall, magnetic, field, this, happens, because, the, orbitals, of, those, two, electrons, d, z, 2, and, d, x, 2, y, 2, do, not, point, toward, neighboring, atoms, in, the, lattice, and, therefore, are, not, involved, in, metallic, bonding, in, the, absence, of, an, external, source, of, magnetic, field, the, atoms, get, spontaneously, partitioned, into, magnetic, domains, about, 10, micrometers, across, such, that, the, atoms, in, each, domain, have, parallel, spins, but, some, domains, have, other, orientations, thus, a, macroscopic, piece, of, iron, will, have, a, nearly, zero, overall, magnetic, field, application, of, an, external, magnetic, field, causes, the, domains, that, are, magnetized, in, the, same, general, direction, to, grow, at, the, expense, of, adjacent, ones, that, point, in, other, directions, reinforcing, the, external, field, this, effect, is, exploited, in, devices, that, need, to, channel, magnetic, fields, to, fulfill, design, function, such, as, electrical, transformers, magnetic, recording, heads, and, electric, motors, impurities, lattice, defects, or, grain, and, particle, boundaries, can, pin, the, domains, in, the, new, positions, so, that, the, effect, persists, even, after, the, external, field, is, removed, thus, turning, the, iron, object, into, a, permanent, magnet, similar, behavior, is, exhibited, by, some, iron, compounds, such, as, the, ferrites, including, the, mineral, magnetite, a, crystalline, form, of, the, mixed, iron, ii, iii, oxide, fe, 3, o, 4, although, the, atomic, scale, mechanism, ferrimagnetism, is, somewhat, different, pieces, of, magnetite, with, natural, permanent, magnetization, lodestones, provided, the, earliest, compasses, for, navigation, particles, of, magnetite, were, extensively, used, in, magnetic, recording, media, such, as, core, memories, magnetic, tapes, floppies, and, disks, until, they, were, replaced, by, cobalt, based, materials, iron, has, four, stable, isotopes, 54, fe, 5, 845, of, natural, iron, 56, fe, 91, 754, 57, fe, 2, 119, and, 58, fe, 0, 282, twenty, four, artificial, isotopes, have, also, been, created, of, these, stable, isotopes, only, 57, fe, has, a, nuclear, spin, 1, 2, the, nuclide, 54, fe, theoretically, can, undergo, double, electron, capture, to, 54, cr, but, the, process, has, never, been, observed, and, only, a, lower, limit, on, the, half, life, of, 4, 4, 10, 20, years, has, been, established, 60, fe, is, an, extinct, radionuclide, of, long, half, life, 2, 6, million, years, it, is, not, found, on, earth, but, its, ultimate, decay, product, is, its, granddaughter, the, stable, nuclide, 60, ni, much, of, the, past, work, on, isotopic, composition, of, iron, has, focused, on, the, nucleosynthesis, of, 60, fe, through, studies, of, meteorites, and, ore, formation, in, the, last, decade, advances, in, mass, spectrometry, have, allowed, the, detection, and, quantification, of, minute, naturally, occurring, variations, in, the, ratios, of, the, stable, isotopes, of, iron, much, of, this, work, is, driven, by, the, earth, and, planetary, science, communities, although, applications, to, biological, and, industrial, systems, are, emerging, in, phases, of, the, meteorites, semarkona, and, chervony, kut, a, correlation, between, the, concentration, of, 60, ni, the, granddaughter, of, 60, fe, and, the, abundance, of, the, stable, iron, isotopes, provided, evidence, for, the, existence, of, 60, fe, at, the, time, of, formation, of, the, solar, system, possibly, the, energy, released, by, the, decay, of, 60, fe, along, with, that, released, by, 26, al, contributed, to, the, remelting, and, differentiation, of, asteroids, after, their, formation, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, the, abundance, of, 60, ni, present, in, extraterrestrial, material, may, bring, further, insight, into, the, origin, and, early, history, of, the, solar, system, the, most, abundant, iron, isotope, 56, fe, is, of, particular, interest, to, nuclear, scientists, because, it, represents, the, most, common, endpoint, of, nucleosynthesis, since, 56, ni, 14, alpha, particles, is, easily, produced, from, lighter, nuclei, in, the, alpha, process, in, nuclear, reactions, in, supernovae, see, silicon, burning, process, it, is, the, endpoint, of, fusion, chains, inside, extremely, massive, stars, although, adding, more, alpha, particles, is, possible, but, nonetheless, the, sequence, does, effectively, end, at, 56, ni, because, conditions, in, stellar, interiors, cause, the, competition, between, photodisintegration, and, the, alpha, process, to, favor, photodisintegration, around, 56, ni, this, 56, ni, which, has, a, half, life, of, about, 6, days, is, created, in, quantity, in, these, stars, but, soon, decays, by, two, successive, positron, emissions, within, supernova, decay, products, in, the, supernova, remnant, gas, cloud, first, to, radioactive, 56, co, and, then, to, stable, 56, fe, as, such, iron, is, the, most, abundant, element, in, the, core, of, red, giants, and, is, the, most, abundant, metal, in, iron, meteorites, and, in, the, dense, metal, cores, of, planets, such, as, earth, it, is, also, very, common, in, the, universe, relative, to, other, stable, metals, of, approximately, the, same, atomic, weight, iron, is, the, sixth, most, abundant, element, in, the, universe, and, the, most, common, refractory, element, although, a, further, tiny, energy, gain, could, be, extracted, by, synthesizing, 62, ni, which, has, a, marginally, higher, binding, energy, than, 56, fe, conditions, in, stars, are, unsuitable, for, this, process, element, production, in, supernovas, greatly, favor, iron, over, nickel, and, in, any, case, 56, fe, still, has, a, lower, mass, per, nucleon, than, 62, ni, due, to, its, higher, fraction, of, lighter, protons, hence, elements, heavier, than, iron, require, a, supernova, for, their, formation, involving, rapid, neutron, capture, by, starting, 56, fe, nuclei, in, the, far, future, of, the, universe, assuming, that, proton, decay, does, not, occur, cold, fusion, occurring, via, quantum, tunnelling, would, cause, the, light, nuclei, in, ordinary, matter, to, fuse, into, 56, fe, nuclei, fission, and, alpha, particle, emission, would, then, make, heavy, nuclei, decay, into, iron, converting, all, stellar, mass, objects, to, cold, spheres, of, pure, iron, iron, s, abundance, in, rocky, planets, like, earth, is, due, to, its, abundant, production, during, the, runaway, fusion, and, explosion, of, type, ia, supernovae, which, scatters, the, iron, into, space, metallic, or, native, iron, is, rarely, found, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, because, it, tends, to, oxidize, however, both, the, earth, s, inner, and, outer, core, which, together, account, for, 35, of, the, mass, of, the, whole, earth, are, believed, to, consist, largely, of, an, iron, alloy, possibly, with, nickel, electric, currents, in, the, liquid, outer, core, are, believed, to, be, the, origin, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, other, terrestrial, planets, mercury, venus, and, mars, as, well, as, the, moon, are, believed, to, have, a, metallic, core, consisting, mostly, of, iron, the, m, type, asteroids, are, also, believed, to, be, partly, or, mostly, made, of, metallic, iron, alloy, the, rare, iron, meteorites, are, the, main, form, of, natural, metallic, iron, on, the, earth, s, surface, items, made, of, cold, worked, meteoritic, iron, have, been, found, in, various, archaeological, sites, dating, from, a, time, when, iron, smelting, had, not, yet, been, developed, and, the, inuit, in, greenland, have, been, reported, to, use, iron, from, the, cape, york, meteorite, for, tools, and, hunting, weapons, about, 1, in, 20, meteorites, consist, of, the, unique, iron, nickel, minerals, taenite, 35, 80, iron, and, kamacite, 90, 95, iron, native, iron, is, also, rarely, found, in, basalts, that, have, formed, from, magmas, that, have, come, into, contact, with, carbon, rich, sedimentary, rocks, which, have, reduced, the, oxygen, fugacity, sufficiently, for, iron, to, crystallize, this, is, known, as, telluric, iron, and, is, described, from, a, few, localities, such, as, disko, island, in, west, greenland, yakutia, in, russia, and, b, hl, in, germany, ferropericlase, mg, fe, o, a, solid, solution, of, periclase, mgo, and, w, stite, feo, makes, up, about, 20, of, the, volume, of, the, lower, mantle, of, the, earth, which, makes, it, the, second, most, abundant, mineral, phase, in, that, region, after, silicate, perovskite, mg, fe, sio, 3, it, also, is, the, major, host, for, iron, in, the, lower, mantle, at, the, bottom, of, the, transition, zone, of, the, mantle, the, reaction, mg, fe, 2, mg, fe, mg, fe, o, transforms, olivine, into, a, mixture, of, silicate, perovskite, and, ferropericlase, and, vice, versa, in, the, literature, this, mineral, phase, of, the, lower, mantle, is, also, often, called, magnesiow, stite, silicate, perovskite, may, form, up, to, 93, of, the, lower, mantle, and, the, magnesium, iron, form, mg, fe, sio, 3, is, considered, to, be, the, most, abundant, mineral, in, the, earth, making, up, 38, of, its, volume, while, iron, is, the, most, abundant, element, on, earth, most, of, this, iron, is, concentrated, in, the, inner, and, outer, cores, the, fraction, of, iron, that, is, in, earth, s, crust, only, amounts, to, about, 5, of, the, overall, mass, of, the, crust, and, is, thus, only, the, fourth, most, abundant, element, in, that, layer, after, oxygen, silicon, and, aluminium, most, of, the, iron, in, the, crust, is, combined, with, various, other, elements, to, form, many, iron, minerals, an, important, class, is, the, iron, oxide, minerals, such, as, hematite, fe, 2, o, 3, magnetite, fe, 3, o, 4, and, siderite, feco, 3, which, are, the, major, ores, of, iron, many, igneous, rocks, also, contain, the, sulfide, minerals, pyrrhotite, and, pentlandite, during, weathering, iron, tends, to, leach, from, sulfide, deposits, as, the, sulfate, and, from, silicate, deposits, as, the, bicarbonate, both, of, these, are, oxidized, in, aqueous, solution, and, precipitate, in, even, mildly, elevated, ph, as, iron, iii, oxide, large, deposits, of, iron, are, banded, iron, formations, a, type, of, rock, consisting, of, repeated, thin, layers, of, iron, oxides, alternating, with, bands, of, iron, poor, shale, and, chert, the, banded, iron, formations, were, laid, down, in, the, time, between, 3, 700, million, years, ago, and, 1, 800, million, years, ago, materials, containing, finely, ground, iron, iii, oxides, or, oxide, hydroxides, such, as, ochre, have, been, used, as, yellow, red, and, brown, pigments, since, pre, historical, times, they, contribute, as, well, to, the, color, of, various, rocks, and, clays, including, entire, geological, formations, like, the, painted, hills, in, oregon, and, the, buntsandstein, colored, sandstone, british, bunter, through, eisensandstein, a, jurassic, iron, sandstone, e, g, from, donzdorf, in, germany, and, bath, stone, in, the, uk, iron, compounds, are, responsible, for, the, yellowish, color, of, many, historical, buildings, and, sculptures, the, proverbial, red, color, of, the, surface, of, mars, is, derived, from, an, iron, oxide, rich, regolith, significant, amounts, of, iron, occur, in, the, iron, sulfide, mineral, pyrite, fes, 2, but, it, is, difficult, to, extract, iron, from, it, and, it, is, therefore, not, exploited, in, fact, iron, is, so, common, that, production, generally, focuses, only, on, ores, with, very, high, quantities, of, it, according, to, the, international, resource, panel, s, metal, stocks, in, society, report, the, global, stock, of, iron, in, use, in, society, is, 2, 200, kg, per, capita, more, developed, countries, differ, in, this, respect, from, less, developed, countries, 7, 000, 14, 000, vs, 2, 000, kg, per, capita, ocean, science, demonstrated, the, role, of, the, iron, in, the, ancient, seas, in, both, marine, biota, and, climate, iron, shows, the, characteristic, chemical, properties, of, the, transition, metals, namely, the, ability, to, form, variable, oxidation, states, differing, by, steps, of, one, and, a, very, large, coordination, and, organometallic, chemistry, indeed, it, was, the, discovery, of, an, iron, compound, ferrocene, that, revolutionalized, the, latter, field, in, the, 1950s, iron, is, sometimes, considered, as, a, prototype, for, the, entire, block, of, transition, metals, due, to, its, abundance, and, the, immense, role, it, has, played, in, the, technological, progress, of, humanity, its, 26, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 3d, 6, 4s, 2, of, which, the, 3d, and, 4s, electrons, are, relatively, close, in, energy, and, thus, a, number, of, electrons, can, be, ionized, iron, forms, compounds, mainly, in, the, oxidation, states, 2, iron, ii, ferrous, and, 3, iron, iii, ferric, iron, also, occurs, in, higher, oxidation, states, e, g, the, purple, potassium, ferrate, k, 2, feo, 4, which, contains, iron, in, its, 6, oxidation, state, the, anion, with, iron, in, its, 7, oxidation, state, along, with, an, iron, v, peroxo, isomer, has, been, detected, by, infrared, spectroscopy, at, 4, k, after, cocondensation, of, laser, ablated, fe, atoms, with, a, mixture, of, o, 2, ar, iron, iv, is, a, common, intermediate, in, many, biochemical, oxidation, reactions, numerous, organoiron, compounds, contain, formal, oxidation, states, of, 1, 0, 1, or, even, 2, the, oxidation, states, and, other, bonding, properties, are, often, assessed, using, the, technique, of, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, many, mixed, valence, compounds, contain, both, iron, ii, and, iron, iii, centers, such, as, magnetite, and, prussian, blue, fe, 4, fe, 6, 3, the, latter, is, used, as, the, traditional, blue, in, blueprints, iron, is, the, first, of, the, transition, metals, that, cannot, reach, its, group, oxidation, state, of, 8, although, its, heavier, congeners, ruthenium, and, osmium, can, with, ruthenium, having, more, difficulty, than, osmium, ruthenium, exhibits, an, aqueous, cationic, chemistry, in, its, low, oxidation, states, similar, to, that, of, iron, but, osmium, does, not, favoring, high, oxidation, states, in, which, it, forms, anionic, complexes, in, the, second, half, of, the, 3d, transition, series, vertical, similarities, down, the, groups, compete, with, the, horizontal, similarities, of, iron, with, its, neighbors, cobalt, and, nickel, in, the, periodic, table, which, are, also, ferromagnetic, at, room, temperature, and, share, similar, chemistry, as, such, iron, cobalt, and, nickel, are, sometimes, grouped, together, as, the, iron, triad, unlike, many, other, metals, iron, does, not, form, amalgams, with, mercury, as, a, result, mercury, is, traded, in, standardized, 76, pound, flasks, 34, kg, made, of, iron, iron, is, by, far, the, most, reactive, element, in, its, group, it, is, pyrophoric, when, finely, divided, and, dissolves, easily, in, dilute, acids, giving, fe, 2, however, it, does, not, react, with, concentrated, nitric, acid, and, other, oxidizing, acids, due, to, the, formation, of, an, impervious, oxide, layer, which, can, nevertheless, react, with, hydrochloric, acid, high, purity, iron, called, electrolytic, iron, is, considered, to, be, resistant, to, rust, due, to, its, oxide, layer, iron, forms, various, oxide, and, hydroxide, compounds, the, most, common, are, iron, ii, iii, oxide, fe, 3, o, 4, and, iron, iii, oxide, fe, 2, o, 3, iron, ii, oxide, also, exists, though, it, is, unstable, at, room, temperature, despite, their, names, they, are, actually, all, non, stoichiometric, compounds, whose, compositions, may, vary, these, oxides, are, the, principal, ores, for, the, production, of, iron, see, bloomery, and, blast, furnace, they, are, also, used, in, the, production, of, ferrites, useful, magnetic, storage, media, in, computers, and, pigments, the, best, known, sulfide, is, iron, pyrite, fes, 2, also, known, as, fool, s, gold, owing, to, its, golden, luster, it, is, not, an, iron, iv, compound, but, is, actually, an, iron, ii, polysulfide, containing, fe, 2, and, s, 2, 2, ions, in, a, distorted, sodium, chloride, structure, the, binary, ferrous, and, ferric, halides, are, well, known, the, ferrous, halides, typically, arise, from, treating, iron, metal, with, the, corresponding, hydrohalic, acid, to, give, the, corresponding, hydrated, salts, iron, reacts, with, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, to, give, the, corresponding, ferric, halides, ferric, chloride, being, the, most, common, ferric, iodide, is, an, exception, being, thermodynamically, unstable, due, to, the, oxidizing, power, of, fe, 3, and, the, high, reducing, power, of, i, ferric, iodide, a, black, solid, is, not, stable, in, ordinary, conditions, but, can, be, prepared, through, the, reaction, of, iron, pentacarbonyl, with, iodine, and, carbon, monoxide, in, the, presence, of, hexane, and, light, at, the, temperature, of, 20, c, with, oxygen, and, water, excluded, complexes, of, ferric, iodide, with, some, soft, bases, are, known, to, be, stable, compounds, the, standard, reduction, potentials, in, acidic, aqueous, solution, for, some, common, iron, ions, are, given, below, the, red, purple, tetrahedral, ferrate, vi, anion, is, such, a, strong, oxidizing, agent, that, it, oxidizes, ammonia, to, nitrogen, n, 2, and, water, to, oxygen, the, pale, violet, hex, aquo, complex, 3, is, an, acid, such, that, above, ph, 0, it, is, fully, hydrolyzed, as, ph, rises, above, 0, the, above, yellow, hydrolyzed, species, form, and, as, it, rises, above, 2, 3, reddish, brown, hydrous, iron, iii, oxide, precipitates, out, of, solution, although, fe, 3, has, a, d, 5, configuration, its, absorption, spectrum, is, not, like, that, of, mn, 2, with, its, weak, spin, forbidden, d, d, bands, because, fe, 3, has, higher, positive, charge, and, is, more, polarizing, lowering, the, energy, of, its, ligand, to, metal, charge, transfer, absorptions, thus, all, the, above, complexes, are, rather, strongly, colored, with, the, single, exception, of, the, hexaquo, ion, and, even, that, has, a, spectrum, dominated, by, charge, transfer, in, the, near, ultraviolet, region, on, the, other, hand, the, pale, green, iron, ii, hexaquo, ion, 2, does, not, undergo, appreciable, hydrolysis, carbon, dioxide, is, not, evolved, when, carbonate, anions, are, added, which, instead, results, in, white, iron, ii, carbonate, being, precipitated, out, in, excess, carbon, dioxide, this, forms, the, slightly, soluble, bicarbonate, which, occurs, commonly, in, groundwater, but, it, oxidises, quickly, in, air, to, form, iron, iii, oxide, that, accounts, for, the, brown, deposits, present, in, a, sizeable, number, of, streams, due, to, its, electronic, structure, iron, has, a, very, large, coordination, and, organometallic, chemistry, many, coordination, compounds, of, iron, are, known, a, typical, six, coordinate, anion, is, hexachloroferrate, iii, 3, found, in, the, mixed, salt, tetrakis, methylammonium, hexachloroferrate, iii, chloride, complexes, with, multiple, bidentate, ligands, have, geometric, isomers, for, example, the, trans, chlorohydridobis, bis, 1, 2, diphenylphosphino, ethane, iron, ii, complex, is, used, as, a, starting, material, for, compounds, with, the, fe, dppe, 2, moiety, the, ferrioxalate, ion, with, three, oxalate, ligands, displays, helical, chirality, with, its, two, non, superposable, geometries, labelled, lambda, for, the, left, handed, screw, axis, and, delta, for, the, right, handed, screw, axis, in, line, with, iupac, conventions, potassium, ferrioxalate, is, used, in, chemical, actinometry, and, along, with, its, sodium, salt, undergoes, photoreduction, applied, in, old, style, photographic, processes, the, dihydrate, of, iron, ii, oxalate, has, a, polymeric, structure, with, co, planar, oxalate, ions, bridging, between, iron, centres, with, the, water, of, crystallisation, located, forming, the, caps, of, each, octahedron, as, illustrated, below, iron, iii, complexes, are, quite, similar, to, those, of, chromium, iii, with, the, exception, of, iron, iii, s, preference, for, o, donor, instead, of, n, donor, ligands, the, latter, tend, to, be, rather, more, unstable, than, iron, ii, complexes, and, often, dissociate, in, water, many, fe, o, complexes, show, intense, colors, and, are, used, as, tests, for, phenols, or, enols, for, example, in, the, ferric, chloride, test, used, to, determine, the, presence, of, phenols, iron, iii, chloride, reacts, with, a, phenol, to, form, a, deep, violet, complex, among, the, halide, and, pseudohalide, complexes, fluoro, complexes, of, iron, iii, are, the, most, stable, with, the, colorless, 2, being, the, most, stable, in, aqueous, solution, chloro, complexes, are, less, stable, and, favor, tetrahedral, coordination, as, in, and, are, reduced, easily, to, iron, ii, thiocyanate, is, a, common, test, for, the, presence, of, iron, iii, as, it, forms, the, blood, red, 2, like, manganese, ii, most, iron, iii, complexes, are, high, spin, the, exceptions, being, those, with, ligands, that, are, high, in, the, spectrochemical, series, such, as, cyanide, an, example, of, a, low, spin, iron, iii, complex, is, 3, iron, shows, a, great, variety, of, electronic, spin, states, including, every, possible, spin, quantum, number, value, for, a, d, block, element, from, 0, diamagnetic, to, 5, 2, 5, unpaired, electrons, this, value, is, always, half, the, number, of, unpaired, electrons, complexes, with, zero, to, two, unpaired, electrons, are, considered, low, spin, and, those, with, four, or, five, are, considered, high, spin, iron, ii, complexes, are, less, stable, than, iron, iii, complexes, but, the, preference, for, o, donor, ligands, is, less, marked, so, that, for, example, 2, is, known, while, 3, is, not, they, have, a, tendency, to, be, oxidized, to, iron, iii, but, this, can, be, moderated, by, low, ph, and, the, specific, ligands, used, organoiron, chemistry, is, the, study, of, organometallic, compounds, of, iron, where, carbon, atoms, are, covalently, bound, to, the, metal, atom, they, are, many, and, varied, including, cyanide, complexes, carbonyl, complexes, sandwich, and, half, sandwich, compounds, prussian, blue, or, ferric, ferrocyanide, fe, 4, 3, is, an, old, and, well, known, iron, cyanide, complex, extensively, used, as, pigment, and, in, several, other, applications, its, formation, can, be, used, as, a, simple, wet, chemistry, test, to, distinguish, between, aqueous, solutions, of, fe, 2, and, fe, 3, as, they, react, respectively, with, potassium, ferricyanide, and, potassium, ferrocyanide, to, form, prussian, blue, another, old, example, of, an, organoiron, compound, is, iron, pentacarbonyl, fe, co, 5, in, which, a, neutral, iron, atom, is, bound, to, the, carbon, atoms, of, five, carbon, monoxide, molecules, the, compound, can, be, used, to, make, carbonyl, iron, powder, a, highly, reactive, form, of, metallic, iron, thermolysis, of, iron, pentacarbonyl, gives, triiron, dodecacarbonyl, fe, 3, co, 12, a, complex, with, a, cluster, of, three, iron, atoms, at, its, core, collman, s, reagent, disodium, tetracarbonylferrate, is, a, useful, reagent, for, organic, chemistry, it, contains, iron, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, cyclopentadienyliron, dicarbonyl, dimer, contains, iron, in, the, rare, 1, oxidation, state, a, landmark, in, this, field, was, the, discovery, in, 1951, of, the, remarkably, stable, sandwich, compound, ferrocene, fe, c, 5, h, 5, 2, by, pauson, and, kealy, and, independently, by, miller, and, colleagues, whose, surprising, molecular, structure, was, determined, only, a, year, later, by, woodward, and, wilkinson, and, fischer, ferrocene, is, still, one, of, the, most, important, tools, and, models, in, this, class, iron, centered, organometallic, species, are, used, as, catalysts, the, kn, lker, complex, for, example, is, a, transfer, hydrogenation, catalyst, for, ketones, the, iron, compounds, produced, on, the, largest, scale, in, industry, are, iron, ii, sulfate, feso, 4, 7, h, 2, o, and, iron, iii, chloride, fecl, 3, the, former, is, one, of, the, most, readily, available, sources, of, iron, ii, but, is, less, stable, to, aerial, oxidation, than, mohr, s, salt, nh, 4, 2, fe, so, 4, 2, 6h, 2, o, iron, ii, compounds, tend, to, be, oxidized, to, iron, iii, compounds, in, the, air, iron, is, one, of, the, elements, undoubtedly, known, to, the, ancient, world, it, has, been, worked, or, wrought, for, millennia, however, iron, artefacts, of, great, age, are, much, rarer, than, objects, made, of, gold, or, silver, due, to, the, ease, with, which, iron, corrodes, the, technology, developed, slowly, and, even, after, the, discovery, of, smelting, it, took, many, centuries, for, iron, to, replace, bronze, as, the, metal, of, choice, for, tools, and, weapons, beads, made, from, meteoric, iron, in, 3500, bc, or, earlier, were, found, in, gerzeh, egypt, by, g, a, wainwright, the, beads, contain, 7, 5, nickel, which, is, a, signature, of, meteoric, origin, since, iron, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, generally, has, only, minuscule, nickel, impurities, meteoric, iron, was, highly, regarded, due, to, its, origin, in, the, heavens, and, was, often, used, to, forge, weapons, and, tools, for, example, a, dagger, made, of, meteoric, iron, was, found, in, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, containing, similar, proportions, of, iron, cobalt, and, nickel, to, a, meteorite, discovered, in, the, area, deposited, by, an, ancient, meteor, shower, items, that, were, likely, made, of, iron, by, egyptians, date, from, 3000, to, 2500, bc, meteoritic, iron, is, comparably, soft, and, ductile, and, easily, cold, forged, but, may, get, brittle, when, heated, because, of, the, nickel, content, the, first, iron, production, started, in, the, middle, bronze, age, but, it, took, several, centuries, before, iron, displaced, bronze, samples, of, smelted, iron, from, asmar, mesopotamia, and, tall, chagar, bazaar, in, northern, syria, were, made, sometime, between, 3000, and, 2700, bc, the, hittites, established, an, empire, in, north, central, anatolia, around, 1600, bc, they, appear, to, be, the, first, to, understand, the, production, of, iron, from, its, ores, and, regard, it, highly, in, their, society, the, hittites, began, to, smelt, iron, between, 1500, and, 1200, bc, and, the, practice, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, near, east, after, their, empire, fell, in, 1180, bc, the, subsequent, period, is, called, the, iron, age, artifacts, of, smelted, iron, are, found, in, india, dating, from, 1800, to, 1200, bc, and, in, the, levant, from, about, 1500, bc, suggesting, smelting, in, anatolia, or, the, caucasus, alleged, references, compare, history, of, metallurgy, in, south, asia, to, iron, in, the, indian, vedas, have, been, used, for, claims, of, a, very, early, usage, of, iron, in, india, respectively, to, date, the, texts, as, such, the, rigveda, term, ayas, metal, refers, to, copper, while, iron, which, is, called, as, y, ma, ayas, literally, black, copper, first, is, mentioned, in, the, post, rigvedic, atharvaveda, some, archaeological, evidence, suggests, iron, was, smelted, in, zimbabwe, and, southeast, africa, as, early, as, the, eighth, century, bc, iron, working, was, introduced, to, greece, in, the, late, 11th, century, bc, from, which, it, spread, quickly, throughout, europe, the, spread, of, ironworking, in, central, and, western, europe, is, associated, with, celtic, expansion, according, to, pliny, the, elder, iron, use, was, common, in, the, roman, era, in, the, lands, of, what, is, now, considered, china, iron, appears, approximately, 700, 500, bc, iron, smelting, may, have, been, introduced, into, china, through, central, asia, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, use, of, a, blast, furnace, in, china, dates, to, the, 1st, century, ad, and, cupola, furnaces, were, used, as, early, as, the, warring, states, period, 403, 221, bc, usage, of, the, blast, and, cupola, furnace, remained, widespread, during, the, tang, and, song, dynasties, during, the, industrial, revolution, in, britain, henry, cort, began, refining, iron, from, pig, iron, to, wrought, iron, or, bar, iron, using, innovative, production, systems, in, 1783, he, patented, the, puddling, process, for, refining, iron, ore, it, was, later, improved, by, others, including, joseph, hall, cast, iron, was, first, produced, in, china, during, 5th, century, bc, but, was, hardly, in, europe, until, the, medieval, period, the, earliest, cast, iron, artifacts, were, discovered, by, archaeologists, in, what, is, now, modern, luhe, county, jiangsu, in, china, cast, iron, was, used, in, ancient, china, for, warfare, agriculture, and, architecture, during, the, medieval, period, means, were, found, in, europe, of, producing, wrought, iron, from, cast, iron, in, this, context, known, as, pig, iron, using, finery, forges, for, all, these, processes, charcoal, was, required, as, fuel, medieval, blast, furnaces, were, about, 10, feet, 3, 0, m, tall, and, made, of, fireproof, brick, forced, air, was, usually, provided, by, hand, operated, bellows, modern, blast, furnaces, have, grown, much, bigger, with, hearths, fourteen, meters, in, diameter, that, allow, them, to, produce, thousands, of, tons, of, iron, each, day, but, essentially, operate, in, much, the, same, way, as, they, did, during, medieval, times, in, 1709, abraham, darby, i, established, a, coke, fired, blast, furnace, to, produce, cast, iron, replacing, charcoal, although, continuing, to, use, blast, furnaces, the, ensuing, availability, of, inexpensive, iron, was, one, of, the, factors, leading, to, the, industrial, revolution, toward, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, cast, iron, began, to, replace, wrought, iron, for, certain, purposes, because, it, was, cheaper, carbon, content, in, iron, was, not, implicated, as, the, reason, for, the, differences, in, properties, of, wrought, iron, cast, iron, and, steel, until, the, 18th, century, since, iron, was, becoming, cheaper, and, more, plentiful, it, also, became, a, major, structural, material, following, the, building, of, the, innovative, first, iron, bridge, in, 1778, this, bridge, still, stands, today, as, a, monument, to, the, role, iron, played, in, the, industrial, revolution, following, this, iron, was, used, in, rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and, buildings, as, well, as, in, iron, cylinders, in, steam, engines, railways, have, been, central, to, the, formation, of, modernity, and, ideas, of, progress, and, various, languages, refer, to, railways, as, iron, road, e, g, french, chemin, de, fer, german, eisenbahn, turkish, demiryolu, russian, chinese, japanese, and, korean, vietnamese, ng, s, t, steel, with, smaller, carbon, content, than, pig, iron, but, more, than, wrought, iron, was, first, produced, in, antiquity, by, using, a, bloomery, blacksmiths, in, luristan, in, western, persia, were, making, good, steel, by, 1000, bc, then, improved, versions, wootz, steel, by, india, and, damascus, steel, were, developed, around, 300, bc, and, ad, 500, respectively, these, methods, were, specialized, and, so, steel, did, not, become, a, major, commodity, until, the, 1850s, new, methods, of, producing, it, by, carburizing, bars, of, iron, in, the, cementation, process, were, devised, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, industrial, revolution, new, methods, of, producing, bar, iron, without, charcoal, were, devised, and, these, were, later, applied, to, produce, steel, in, the, late, 1850s, henry, bessemer, invented, a, new, steelmaking, process, involving, blowing, air, through, molten, pig, iron, to, produce, mild, steel, this, made, steel, much, more, economical, thereby, leading, to, wrought, iron, no, longer, being, produced, in, large, quantities, in, 1774, antoine, lavoisier, used, the, reaction, of, water, steam, with, metallic, iron, inside, an, incandescent, iron, tube, to, produce, hydrogen, in, his, experiments, leading, to, the, demonstration, of, the, conservation, of, mass, which, was, instrumental, in, changing, chemistry, from, a, qualitative, science, to, a, quantitative, one, iron, plays, a, certain, role, in, mythology, and, has, found, various, usage, as, a, metaphor, and, in, folklore, the, greek, poet, hesiod, s, works, and, days, lines, 109, 201, lists, different, ages, of, man, named, after, metals, like, gold, silver, bronze, and, iron, to, account, for, successive, ages, of, humanity, the, iron, age, was, closely, related, with, rome, and, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, the, virtues, in, despair, quit, the, earth, and, the, depravity, of, man, becomes, universal, and, complete, hard, steel, succeeded, then, an, example, of, the, importance, of, iron, s, symbolic, role, may, be, found, in, the, german, campaign, of, 1813, frederick, william, iii, commissioned, then, the, first, iron, cross, as, military, decoration, berlin, iron, jewellery, reached, its, peak, production, between, 1813, and, 1815, when, the, prussian, royal, family, urged, citizens, to, donate, gold, and, silver, jewellery, for, military, funding, the, inscription, ich, gab, gold, f, r, eisen, i, gave, gold, for, iron, was, used, as, well, in, later, war, efforts, for, a, few, limited, purposes, when, it, is, needed, pure, iron, is, produced, in, the, laboratory, in, small, quantities, by, reducing, the, pure, oxide, or, hydroxide, with, hydrogen, or, forming, iron, pentacarbonyl, and, heating, it, to, 250, c, so, that, it, decomposes, to, form, pure, iron, powder, another, method, is, electrolysis, of, ferrous, chloride, onto, an, iron, cathode, nowadays, the, industrial, production, of, iron, or, steel, consists, of, two, main, stages, in, the, first, stage, iron, ore, is, reduced, with, coke, in, a, blast, furnace, and, the, molten, metal, is, separated, from, gross, impurities, such, as, silicate, minerals, this, stage, yields, an, alloy, pig, iron, that, contains, relatively, large, amounts, of, carbon, in, the, second, stage, the, amount, of, carbon, in, the, pig, iron, is, lowered, by, oxidation, to, yield, wrought, iron, steel, or, cast, iron, other, metals, can, be, added, at, this, stage, to, form, alloy, steels, the, blast, furnace, is, loaded, with, iron, ores, usually, hematite, fe, 2, o, 3, or, magnetite, fe, 3, o, 4, along, with, coke, coal, that, has, been, separately, baked, to, remove, volatile, components, and, flux, limestone, or, dolomite, blasts, of, air, pre, heated, to, 900, c, sometimes, with, oxygen, enrichment, is, blown, through, the, mixture, in, sufficient, amount, to, turn, the, carbon, into, carbon, monoxide, this, reaction, raises, the, temperature, to, about, 2000, c, the, carbon, monoxide, reduces, the, iron, ore, to, metallic, iron, some, iron, in, the, high, temperature, lower, region, of, the, furnace, reacts, directly, with, the, coke, the, flux, removes, silicaceous, minerals, in, the, ore, which, would, otherwise, clog, the, furnace, the, heat, of, the, furnace, decomposes, the, carbonates, to, calcium, oxide, which, reacts, with, any, excess, silica, to, form, a, slag, composed, of, calcium, silicate, casio, 3, or, other, products, at, the, furnace, s, temperature, the, metal, and, the, slag, are, both, molten, they, collect, at, the, bottom, as, two, immiscible, liquid, layers, with, the, slag, on, top, that, are, then, easily, separated, the, slag, can, be, used, as, a, material, in, road, construction, or, to, improve, mineral, poor, soils, for, agriculture, steelmaking, thus, remains, one, of, the, largest, industrial, contributors, of, co, 2, emissions, in, the, world, the, pig, iron, produced, by, the, blast, furnace, process, contains, up, to, 4, 5, carbon, by, mass, with, small, amounts, of, other, impurities, like, sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus, and, manganese, this, high, level, of, carbon, makes, it, relatively, weak, and, brittle, reducing, the, amount, of, carbon, to, 0, 002, 2, 1, produces, steel, which, may, be, up, to, 1000, times, harder, than, pure, iron, a, great, variety, of, steel, articles, can, then, be, made, by, cold, working, hot, rolling, forging, machining, etc, removing, the, impurities, from, pig, iron, but, leaving, 2, 4, carbon, results, in, cast, iron, which, is, cast, by, foundries, into, articles, such, as, stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp, posts, and, rails, steel, products, often, undergo, various, heat, treatments, after, they, are, forged, to, shape, annealing, consists, of, heating, them, to, 700, 800, c, for, several, hours, and, then, gradual, cooling, it, makes, the, steel, softer, and, more, workable, owing, to, environmental, concerns, alternative, methods, of, processing, iron, have, been, developed, direct, iron, reduction, reduces, iron, ore, to, a, ferrous, lump, called, sponge, iron, or, direct, iron, that, is, suitable, for, steelmaking, two, main, reactions, comprise, the, direct, reduction, process, natural, gas, is, partially, oxidized, with, heat, and, a, catalyst, iron, ore, is, then, treated, with, these, gases, in, a, furnace, producing, solid, sponge, iron, silica, is, removed, by, adding, a, limestone, flux, as, described, above, ignition, of, a, mixture, of, aluminium, powder, and, iron, oxide, yields, metallic, iron, via, the, thermite, reaction, alternatively, pig, iron, may, be, made, into, steel, with, up, to, about, 2, carbon, or, wrought, iron, commercially, pure, iron, various, processes, have, been, used, for, this, including, finery, forges, puddling, furnaces, bessemer, converters, open, hearth, furnaces, basic, oxygen, furnaces, and, electric, arc, furnaces, in, all, cases, the, objective, is, to, oxidize, some, or, all, of, the, carbon, together, with, other, impurities, on, the, other, hand, other, metals, may, be, added, to, make, alloy, steels, molten, oxide, electrolysis, moe, uses, electrolysis, of, molten, iron, oxide, to, yield, metallic, iron, it, is, studied, in, laboratory, scale, experiments, and, is, proposed, as, a, method, for, industrial, iron, production, that, has, no, direct, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, it, uses, a, liquid, iron, cathode, an, anode, formed, from, an, alloy, of, chromium, aluminium, and, iron, and, the, electrolyte, is, a, mixture, of, molten, metal, oxides, into, which, iron, ore, is, dissolved, the, current, keeps, the, electrolyte, molten, and, reduces, the, iron, oxide, oxygen, gas, is, produced, in, addition, to, liquid, iron, the, only, carbon, dioxide, emissions, come, from, any, fossil, fuel, generated, electricity, used, to, heat, and, reduce, the, metal, iron, is, the, most, widely, used, of, all, the, metals, accounting, for, over, 90, of, worldwide, metal, production, its, low, cost, and, high, strength, often, make, it, the, material, of, choice, to, withstand, stress, or, transmit, forces, such, as, the, construction, of, machinery, and, machine, tools, rails, automobiles, ship, hulls, concrete, reinforcing, bars, and, the, load, carrying, framework, of, buildings, since, pure, iron, is, quite, soft, it, is, most, commonly, combined, with, alloying, elements, to, make, steel, the, mechanical, properties, of, iron, and, its, alloys, are, extremely, relevant, to, their, structural, applications, those, properties, can, be, evaluated, in, various, ways, including, the, brinell, test, the, rockwell, test, and, the, vickers, hardness, test, the, properties, of, pure, iron, are, often, used, to, calibrate, measurements, or, to, compare, tests, however, the, mechanical, properties, of, iron, are, significantly, affected, by, the, sample, s, purity, pure, single, crystals, of, iron, are, actually, softer, than, aluminium, and, the, purest, industrially, produced, iron, 99, 99, has, a, hardness, of, 20, 30, brinell, the, pure, iron, 99, 9, 99, 999, especially, called, electrolytic, iron, is, industrially, produced, by, electrolytic, refining, an, increase, in, the, carbon, content, will, cause, a, significant, increase, in, the, hardness, and, tensile, strength, of, iron, maximum, hardness, of, 65, r, c, is, achieved, with, a, 0, 6, carbon, content, although, the, alloy, has, low, tensile, strength, because, of, the, softness, of, iron, it, is, much, easier, to, work, with, than, its, heavier, congeners, ruthenium, and, osmium, iron, is, a, fairly, soft, metal, that, can, dissolve, only, a, small, concentration, of, carbon, no, more, than, 0, 021, by, mass, at, 910, c, austenite, iron, is, similarly, soft, and, metallic, but, can, dissolve, considerably, more, carbon, as, much, as, 2, 04, by, mass, at, 1146, c, this, form, of, iron, is, used, in, the, type, of, stainless, steel, used, for, making, cutlery, and, hospital, and, food, service, equipment, commercially, available, iron, is, classified, based, on, purity, and, the, abundance, of, additives, pig, iron, has, 3, 5, 4, 5, carbon, and, contains, varying, amounts, of, contaminants, such, as, sulfur, silicon, and, phosphorus, pig, iron, is, not, a, saleable, product, but, rather, an, intermediate, step, in, the, production, of, cast, iron, and, steel, the, reduction, of, contaminants, in, pig, iron, that, negatively, affect, material, properties, such, as, sulfur, and, phosphorus, yields, cast, iron, containing, 2, 4, carbon, 1, 6, silicon, and, small, amounts, of, manganese, pig, iron, has, a, melting, point, in, the, range, of, 1420, 1470, k, which, is, lower, than, either, of, its, two, main, components, and, makes, it, the, first, product, to, be, melted, when, carbon, and, iron, are, heated, together, its, mechanical, properties, vary, greatly, and, depend, on, the, form, the, carbon, takes, in, the, alloy, white, cast, irons, contain, their, carbon, in, the, form, of, cementite, or, iron, carbide, fe, 3, c, this, hard, brittle, compound, dominates, the, mechanical, properties, of, white, cast, irons, rendering, them, hard, but, unresistant, to, shock, the, broken, surface, of, a, white, cast, iron, is, full, of, fine, facets, of, the, broken, iron, carbide, a, very, pale, silvery, shiny, material, hence, the, appellation, cooling, a, mixture, of, iron, with, 0, 8, carbon, slowly, below, 723, c, to, room, temperature, results, in, separate, alternating, layers, of, cementite, and, iron, which, is, soft, and, malleable, and, is, called, pearlite, for, its, appearance, rapid, cooling, on, the, other, hand, does, not, allow, time, for, this, separation, and, creates, hard, and, brittle, martensite, the, steel, can, then, be, tempered, by, reheating, to, a, temperature, in, between, changing, the, proportions, of, pearlite, and, martensite, the, end, product, below, 0, 8, carbon, content, is, a, pearlite, fe, mixture, and, that, above, 0, 8, carbon, content, is, a, pearlite, cementite, mixture, in, gray, iron, the, carbon, exists, as, separate, fine, flakes, of, graphite, and, also, renders, the, material, brittle, due, to, the, sharp, edged, flakes, of, graphite, that, produce, stress, concentration, sites, within, the, material, a, newer, variant, of, gray, iron, referred, to, as, ductile, iron, is, specially, treated, with, trace, amounts, of, magnesium, to, alter, the, shape, of, graphite, to, spheroids, or, nodules, reducing, the, stress, concentrations, and, vastly, increasing, the, toughness, and, strength, of, the, material, wrought, iron, contains, less, than, 0, 25, carbon, but, large, amounts, of, slag, that, give, it, a, fibrous, characteristic, wrought, iron, is, more, corrosion, resistant, than, steel, it, has, been, almost, completely, replaced, by, mild, steel, which, corrodes, more, readily, than, wrought, iron, but, is, cheaper, and, more, widely, available, carbon, steel, contains, 2, 0, carbon, or, less, with, small, amounts, of, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and, silicon, alloy, steels, contain, varying, amounts, of, carbon, as, well, as, other, metals, such, as, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc, their, alloy, content, raises, their, cost, and, so, they, are, usually, only, employed, for, specialist, uses, one, common, alloy, steel, though, is, stainless, steel, recent, developments, in, ferrous, metallurgy, have, produced, a, growing, range, of, microalloyed, steels, also, termed, hsla, or, high, strength, low, alloy, steels, containing, tiny, additions, to, produce, high, strengths, and, often, spectacular, toughness, at, minimal, cost, alloys, with, high, purity, elemental, makeups, such, as, alloys, of, electrolytic, iron, have, specifically, enhanced, properties, such, as, ductility, tensile, strength, toughness, fatigue, strength, heat, resistance, and, corrosion, resistance, apart, from, traditional, applications, iron, is, also, used, for, protection, from, ionizing, radiation, although, it, is, lighter, than, another, traditional, protection, material, lead, it, is, much, stronger, mechanically, the, main, disadvantage, of, iron, and, steel, is, that, pure, iron, and, most, of, its, alloys, suffer, badly, from, rust, if, not, protected, in, some, way, a, cost, amounting, to, over, 1, of, the, world, s, economy, painting, galvanization, passivation, plastic, coating, and, bluing, are, all, used, to, protect, iron, from, rust, by, excluding, water, and, oxygen, or, by, cathodic, protection, the, mechanism, of, the, rusting, of, iron, is, as, follows, the, electrolyte, is, usually, iron, ii, sulfate, in, urban, areas, formed, when, atmospheric, sulfur, dioxide, attacks, iron, and, salt, particles, in, the, atmosphere, in, seaside, areas, because, fe, is, inexpensive, and, nontoxic, much, effort, has, been, devoted, to, the, development, of, fe, based, catalysts, and, reagents, iron, is, however, less, common, as, a, catalyst, in, commercial, processes, than, more, expensive, metals, in, biology, fe, containing, enzymes, are, pervasive, iron, catalysts, are, traditionally, used, in, the, haber, bosch, process, for, the, production, of, ammonia, and, the, fischer, tropsch, process, for, conversion, of, carbon, monoxide, to, hydrocarbons, for, fuels, and, lubricants, powdered, iron, in, an, acidic, medium, is, used, in, the, bechamp, reduction, the, conversion, of, nitrobenzene, to, aniline, iron, iii, oxide, mixed, with, aluminium, powder, can, be, ignited, to, create, a, thermite, reaction, used, in, welding, large, iron, parts, like, rails, and, purifying, ores, iron, iii, oxide, and, oxyhydroxide, are, used, as, reddish, and, ocher, pigments, iron, iii, chloride, finds, use, in, water, purification, and, sewage, treatment, in, the, dyeing, of, cloth, as, a, coloring, agent, in, paints, as, an, additive, in, animal, feed, and, as, an, etchant, for, copper, in, the, manufacture, of, printed, circuit, boards, it, can, also, be, dissolved, in, alcohol, to, form, tincture, of, iron, which, is, used, as, a, medicine, to, stop, bleeding, in, canaries, iron, ii, sulfate, is, used, as, a, precursor, to, other, iron, compounds, it, is, also, used, to, reduce, chromate, in, cement, it, is, used, to, fortify, foods, and, treat, iron, deficiency, anemia, iron, iii, sulfate, is, used, in, settling, minute, sewage, particles, in, tank, water, iron, ii, chloride, is, used, as, a, reducing, flocculating, agent, in, the, formation, of, iron, complexes, and, magnetic, iron, oxides, and, as, a, reducing, agent, in, organic, synthesis, sodium, nitroprusside, is, a, drug, used, as, a, vasodilator, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, iron, is, required, for, life, the, iron, sulfur, clusters, are, pervasive, and, include, nitrogenase, the, enzymes, responsible, for, biological, nitrogen, fixation, iron, containing, proteins, participate, in, transport, storage, and, use, of, oxygen, iron, proteins, are, involved, in, electron, transfer, examples, of, iron, containing, proteins, in, higher, organisms, include, hemoglobin, cytochrome, see, high, valent, iron, and, catalase, the, average, adult, human, contains, about, 0, 005, body, weight, of, iron, or, about, four, grams, of, which, three, quarters, is, in, hemoglobin, a, level, that, remains, constant, despite, only, about, one, milligram, of, iron, being, absorbed, each, day, because, the, human, body, recycles, its, hemoglobin, for, the, iron, content, microbial, growth, may, be, assisted, by, oxidation, of, iron, ii, or, by, reduction, of, iron, iii, iron, acquisition, poses, a, problem, for, aerobic, organisms, because, ferric, iron, is, poorly, soluble, near, neutral, ph, thus, these, organisms, have, developed, means, to, absorb, iron, as, complexes, sometimes, taking, up, ferrous, iron, before, oxidising, it, back, to, ferric, iron, in, particular, bacteria, have, evolved, very, high, affinity, sequestering, agents, called, siderophores, after, uptake, in, human, cells, iron, storage, is, precisely, regulated, a, major, component, of, this, regulation, is, the, protein, transferrin, which, binds, iron, ions, absorbed, from, the, duodenum, and, carries, it, in, the, blood, to, cells, transferrin, contains, fe, 3, in, the, middle, of, a, distorted, octahedron, bonded, to, one, nitrogen, three, oxygens, and, a, chelating, carbonate, anion, that, traps, the, fe, 3, ion, it, has, such, a, high, stability, constant, that, it, is, very, effective, at, taking, up, fe, 3, ions, even, from, the, most, stable, complexes, at, the, bone, marrow, transferrin, is, reduced, from, fe, 3, to, fe, 2, and, stored, as, ferritin, to, be, incorporated, into, hemoglobin, the, most, commonly, known, and, studied, bioinorganic, iron, compounds, biological, iron, molecules, are, the, heme, proteins, examples, are, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and, cytochrome, p450, these, compounds, participate, in, transporting, gases, building, enzymes, and, transferring, electrons, metalloproteins, are, a, group, of, proteins, with, metal, ion, cofactors, some, examples, of, iron, metalloproteins, are, ferritin, and, rubredoxin, many, enzymes, vital, to, life, contain, iron, such, as, catalase, lipoxygenases, and, ire, bp, hemoglobin, is, an, oxygen, carrier, that, occurs, in, red, blood, cells, and, contributes, their, color, transporting, oxygen, in, the, arteries, from, the, lungs, to, the, muscles, where, it, is, transferred, to, myoglobin, which, stores, it, until, it, is, needed, for, the, metabolic, oxidation, of, glucose, generating, energy, here, the, hemoglobin, binds, to, carbon, dioxide, produced, when, glucose, is, oxidized, which, is, transported, through, the, veins, by, hemoglobin, predominantly, as, bicarbonate, anions, back, to, the, lungs, where, it, is, exhaled, in, hemoglobin, the, iron, is, in, one, of, four, heme, groups, and, has, six, possible, coordination, sites, four, are, occupied, by, nitrogen, atoms, in, a, porphyrin, ring, the, fifth, by, an, imidazole, nitrogen, in, a, histidine, residue, of, one, of, the, protein, chains, attached, to, the, heme, group, and, the, sixth, is, reserved, for, the, oxygen, molecule, it, can, reversibly, bind, to, when, hemoglobin, is, not, attached, to, oxygen, and, is, then, called, deoxyhemoglobin, the, fe, 2, ion, at, the, center, of, the, heme, group, in, the, hydrophobic, protein, interior, is, in, a, high, spin, configuration, it, is, thus, too, large, to, fit, inside, the, porphyrin, ring, which, bends, instead, into, a, dome, with, the, fe, 2, ion, about, 55, picometers, above, it, in, this, configuration, the, sixth, coordination, site, reserved, for, the, oxygen, is, blocked, by, another, histidine, residue, when, deoxyhemoglobin, picks, up, an, oxygen, molecule, this, histidine, residue, moves, away, and, returns, once, the, oxygen, is, securely, attached, to, form, a, hydrogen, bond, with, it, this, results, in, the, fe, 2, ion, switching, to, a, low, spin, configuration, resulting, in, a, 20, decrease, in, ionic, radius, so, that, now, it, can, fit, into, the, porphyrin, ring, which, becomes, planar, additionally, this, hydrogen, bonding, results, in, the, tilting, of, the, oxygen, molecule, resulting, in, a, fe, o, o, bond, angle, of, around, 120, that, avoids, the, formation, of, fe, o, fe, or, fe, o, 2, fe, bridges, that, would, lead, to, electron, transfer, the, oxidation, of, fe, 2, to, fe, 3, and, the, destruction, of, hemoglobin, this, results, in, a, movement, of, all, the, protein, chains, that, leads, to, the, other, subunits, of, hemoglobin, changing, shape, to, a, form, with, larger, oxygen, affinity, thus, when, deoxyhemoglobin, takes, up, oxygen, its, affinity, for, more, oxygen, increases, and, vice, versa, myoglobin, on, the, other, hand, contains, only, one, heme, group, and, hence, this, cooperative, effect, cannot, occur, thus, while, hemoglobin, is, almost, saturated, with, oxygen, in, the, high, partial, pressures, of, oxygen, found, in, the, lungs, its, affinity, for, oxygen, is, much, lower, than, that, of, myoglobin, which, oxygenates, even, at, low, partial, pressures, of, oxygen, found, in, muscle, tissue, as, described, by, the, bohr, effect, named, after, christian, bohr, the, father, of, niels, bohr, the, oxygen, affinity, of, hemoglobin, diminishes, in, the, presence, of, carbon, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, and, phosphorus, trifluoride, are, poisonous, to, humans, because, they, bind, to, hemoglobin, similarly, to, oxygen, but, with, much, more, strength, so, that, oxygen, can, no, longer, be, transported, throughout, the, body, hemoglobin, bound, to, carbon, monoxide, is, known, as, carboxyhemoglobin, this, effect, also, plays, a, minor, role, in, the, toxicity, of, cyanide, but, there, the, major, effect, is, by, far, its, interference, with, the, proper, functioning, of, the, electron, transport, protein, cytochrome, a, the, cytochrome, proteins, also, involve, heme, groups, and, are, involved, in, the, metabolic, oxidation, of, glucose, by, oxygen, the, sixth, coordination, site, is, then, occupied, by, either, another, imidazole, nitrogen, or, a, methionine, sulfur, so, that, these, proteins, are, largely, inert, to, oxygen, with, the, exception, of, cytochrome, a, which, bonds, directly, to, oxygen, and, thus, is, very, easily, poisoned, by, cyanide, here, the, electron, transfer, takes, place, as, the, iron, remains, in, low, spin, but, changes, between, the, 2, and, 3, oxidation, states, since, the, reduction, potential, of, each, step, is, slightly, greater, than, the, previous, one, the, energy, is, released, step, by, step, and, can, thus, be, stored, in, adenosine, triphosphate, cytochrome, a, is, slightly, distinct, as, it, occurs, at, the, mitochondrial, membrane, binds, directly, to, oxygen, and, transports, protons, as, well, as, electrons, as, follows, although, the, heme, proteins, are, the, most, important, class, of, iron, containing, proteins, the, iron, sulfur, proteins, are, also, very, important, being, involved, in, electron, transfer, which, is, possible, since, iron, can, exist, stably, in, either, the, 2, or, 3, oxidation, states, these, have, one, two, four, or, eight, iron, atoms, that, are, each, approximately, tetrahedrally, coordinated, to, four, sulfur, atoms, because, of, this, tetrahedral, coordination, they, always, have, high, spin, iron, the, simplest, of, such, compounds, is, rubredoxin, which, has, only, one, iron, atom, coordinated, to, four, sulfur, atoms, from, cysteine, residues, in, the, surrounding, peptide, chains, another, important, class, of, iron, sulfur, proteins, is, the, ferredoxins, which, have, multiple, iron, atoms, transferrin, does, not, belong, to, either, of, these, classes, the, ability, of, sea, mussels, to, maintain, their, grip, on, rocks, in, the, ocean, is, facilitated, by, their, use, of, organometallic, iron, based, bonds, in, their, protein, rich, cuticles, based, on, synthetic, replicas, the, presence, of, iron, in, these, structures, increased, elastic, modulus, 770, times, tensile, strength, 58, times, and, toughness, 92, times, the, amount, of, stress, required, to, permanently, damage, them, increased, 76, times, iron, is, pervasive, but, particularly, rich, sources, of, dietary, iron, include, red, meat, oysters, beans, poultry, fish, leaf, vegetables, watercress, tofu, and, blackstrap, molasses, bread, and, breakfast, cereals, are, sometimes, specifically, fortified, with, iron, iron, provided, by, dietary, supplements, is, often, found, as, iron, ii, fumarate, although, iron, ii, sulfate, is, cheaper, and, is, absorbed, equally, well, elemental, iron, or, reduced, iron, despite, being, absorbed, at, only, one, third, to, two, thirds, the, efficiency, relative, to, iron, sulfate, is, often, added, to, foods, such, as, breakfast, cereals, or, enriched, wheat, flour, iron, is, most, available, to, the, body, when, chelated, to, amino, acids, and, is, also, available, for, use, as, a, common, iron, supplement, glycine, the, least, expensive, amino, acid, is, most, often, used, to, produce, iron, glycinate, supplements, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, iom, updated, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, for, iron, in, 2001, the, current, ear, for, iron, for, women, ages, 14, 18, is, 7, 9, mg, day, 8, 1, mg, day, for, ages, 19, 50, and,

human, body, which, has, no, regulated, physiological, means, of, excreting, iron, only, small, amounts, of, iron, are, lost, daily, due, to, mucosal, and, skin, epithelial, cell, sloughing, so, control, of, iron, levels, is, primarily, accomplished, by, regulating, uptake, regulation, of, iron, uptake, is, impaired, in, some, people, as, a, result, of, a, genetic, defect, that, maps, to, the, hla, h, gene, region, on, chromosome, 6, and, leads, to, abnormally, low, levels, of, hepcidin, a, key, regulator, of, the, entry, of, iron, into, the, circulatory, system, in, mammals, in, these, people, excessive, iron, intake, can, result, in, iron, overload, disorders, known, medically, as, hemochromatosis, many, people, have, an, undiagnosed, genetic, susceptibility, to, iron, overload, and, are, not, aware, of, a, family, history, of, the, problem, for, this, reason, people, should, not, take, iron, supplements, unless, they, suffer, from, iron, deficiency, and, have, consulted, a, doctor, hemochromatosis, is, estimated, to, be, the, cause, of, 0, 3, 0, 8, of, all, metabolic, diseases, of, caucasians, overdoses, of, ingested, iron, can, cause, excessive, levels, of, free, iron, in, the, blood, high, blood, levels, of, free, ferrous, iron, react, with, peroxides, to, produce, highly, reactive, free, radicals, that, can, damage, dna, proteins, lipids, and, other, cellular, components, iron, toxicity, occurs, when, the, cell, contains, free, iron, which, generally, occurs, when, iron, levels, exceed, the, availability, of, transferrin, to, bind, the, iron, damage, to, the, cells, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, can, also, prevent, them, from, regulating, iron, absorption, leading, to, further, increases, in, blood, levels, iron, typically,

excess, iron, from, the, body, some, research, has, suggested, that, low, thalamic, iron, levels, may, play, a, role, in, the, pathophysiology, of, adhd, some, researchers, have, found, that, iron, supplementation, can, be, effective, especially, in, the, inattentive, subtype, of, the, disorder, some, researchers, in, the, 2000s, suggested, a, link, between, low, levels, of, iron, in, the, blood, and, adhd, a, 2012, study, found, no, such, correlation, the, role, of, iron, in, cancer, defense, can, be, described, as, a, double, edged, sword, because, of, its, pervasive, presence, in, non, pathological, processes, people, having, chemotherapy, may, develop, iron, deficiency, and, anemia, for, which, intravenous, iron, therapy, is, used, to, restore, iron, levels, iron, overload, which, may, occur, from, high, consumption, of, red, meat, may, initiate, tumor, growth, and, increase, susceptibility, to, cancer, onset, particularly, for, colorectal, cancer, iron, plays, an, essential, role, in, marine, systems, and, can, act, as, a, limiting, nutrient, for, planktonic, activity, because, of, this, too, much, of, a, decrease, in, iron, may, lead, to, a, decrease, in, growth, rates, in, phytoplanktonic, organisms, such, as, diatoms, iron, can, also, be, oxidized, by, marine, microbes, under, conditions, that, are, high, in, iron, and, low, in, oxygen, iron, can, enter, marine, systems, through, adjoining, rivers, and, directly, from, the, atmosphere, once, iron, enters, the, ocean, it, can, be, distributed, throughout, the, water, column, through, ocean, mixing, and, through, recycling, on, the, cellular, level, in, the, arctic, sea, ice, plays, a, major, role, in, the, store, and, distribution, of, iron, in, the, ocean, depleting, oceanic, iron, as, it, freezes, in, the, winter, and, releasing, it, back, into, the, water, when, thawing, occurs, in, the, summer, the, iron, cycle, can, fluctuate, the, forms, of, iron, from, aqueous, to, particle, forms, altering, the, availability, of, iron, to, primary, producers, increased, light, and, warmth, increases, the, amount, of, iron, that, is, in, forms, that, are, usable, by, primary, producers
