isotopes, are, distinct, nuclear, species, or, nuclides, of, the, same, chemical, element, they, have, the, same, atomic, number, number, of, protons, in, their, nuclei, and, position, in, the, periodic, table, and, hence, belong, to, the, same, chemical, element, but, differ, in, nucleon, numbers, mass, numbers, due, to, different, numbers, of, neutrons, in, their, nuclei, while, all, isotopes, of, a, given, element, have, similar, chemical, properties, they, have, different, atomic, masses, and, physical, properties, the, term, isotope, is, derived, from, the, greek, roots, isos, equal, and, topos, place, meaning, the, same, place, thus, the, meaning, behind, the, name, is, that, different, isotopes, of, a, single, element, occupy, the, same, position, on, the, periodic, table, it, was, coined, by, scottish, doctor, and, writer, margaret, todd, in, a, 1913, suggestion, to, the, british, chemist, frederick, soddy, who, popularized, the, term, the, number, of, protons, within, the, atom, s, nucleus, is, called, its, atomic, number, and, is, equal, to, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, neutral, non, ionized, atom, each, atomic, number, identifies, a, specific, element, but, not, the, isotope, an, atom, of, a, given, element, may, have, a, wide, range, in, its, number, of, neutrons, the, number, of, nucleons, both, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, nucleus, is, the, atom, s, mass, number, and, each, isotope, of, a, given, element, has, a, different, mass, number, for, example, carbon, 12, carbon, 13, and, carbon, 14, are, three, isotopes, of, the, element, carbon, with, mass, numbers, 12, 13, and, 14, respectively, the, atomic, number, of, carbon, is, 6, which, means, that, every, carbon, atom, has, 6, protons, so, that, the, neutron, numbers, of, these, isotopes, are, 6, 7, and, 8, respectively, a, nuclide, is, a, species, of, an, atom, with, a, specific, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, nucleus, for, example, carbon, 13, with, 6, protons, and, 7, neutrons, the, nuclide, concept, referring, to, individual, nuclear, species, emphasizes, nuclear, properties, over, chemical, properties, whereas, the, isotope, concept, grouping, all, atoms, of, each, element, emphasizes, chemical, over, nuclear, the, neutron, number, greatly, affects, nuclear, properties, but, its, effect, on, chemical, properties, is, negligible, for, most, elements, even, for, the, lightest, elements, whose, ratio, of, neutron, number, to, atomic, number, varies, the, most, between, isotopes, it, usually, has, only, a, small, effect, although, it, matters, in, some, circumstances, for, hydrogen, the, lightest, element, the, isotope, effect, is, large, enough, to, affect, biology, strongly, the, term, isotopes, originally, also, isotopic, elements, now, sometimes, isotopic, nuclides, is, intended, to, imply, comparison, like, synonyms, or, isomers, for, example, the, nuclides, 12, 6, c, 13, 6, c, 14, 6, c, are, isotopes, nuclides, with, the, same, atomic, number, but, different, mass, numbers, but, 40, 18, ar, 40, 19, k, 40, 20, ca, are, isobars, nuclides, with, the, same, mass, number, however, isotope, is, the, older, term, and, so, is, better, known, than, nuclide, and, is, still, sometimes, used, in, contexts, in, which, nuclide, might, be, more, appropriate, such, as, nuclear, technology, and, nuclear, medicine, an, isotope, and, or, nuclide, is, specified, by, the, name, of, the, particular, element, this, indicates, the, atomic, number, followed, by, a, hyphen, and, the, mass, number, e, g, helium, 3, helium, 4, carbon, 12, carbon, 14, uranium, 235, and, uranium, 239, when, a, chemical, symbol, is, used, e, g, c, for, carbon, standard, notation, now, known, as, aze, notation, because, a, is, the, mass, number, z, the, atomic, number, and, e, for, element, is, to, indicate, the, mass, number, number, of, nucleons, with, a, superscript, at, the, upper, left, of, the, chemical, symbol, and, to, indicate, the, atomic, number, with, a, subscript, at, the, lower, left, e, g, 3, 2, he, 4, 2, he, 12, 6, c, 14, 6, c, 235, 92, u, and, 239, 92, u, because, the, atomic, number, is, given, by, the, element, symbol, it, is, common, to, state, only, the, mass, number, in, the, superscript, and, leave, out, the, atomic, number, subscript, e, g, 3, he, 4, he, 12, c, 14, c, 235, u, and, 239, u, the, letter, m, for, metastable, is, sometimes, appended, after, the, mass, number, to, indicate, a, nuclear, isomer, a, metastable, or, energetically, excited, nuclear, state, as, opposed, to, the, lowest, energy, ground, state, for, example, 180m, 73, ta, tantalum, 180m, the, common, pronunciation, of, the, aze, notation, is, different, from, how, it, is, written, 4, 2, he, is, commonly, pronounced, as, helium, four, instead, of, four, two, helium, and, 235, 92, u, as, uranium, two, thirty, five, american, english, or, uranium, two, three, five, british, instead, of, 235, 92, uranium, some, isotopes, nuclides, are, radioactive, and, are, therefore, referred, to, as, radioisotopes, or, radionuclides, whereas, others, have, never, been, observed, to, decay, radioactively, and, are, referred, to, as, stable, isotopes, or, stable, nuclides, for, example, 14, c, is, a, radioactive, form, of, carbon, whereas, 12, c, and, 13, c, are, stable, isotopes, there, are, about, 339, naturally, occurring, nuclides, on, earth, of, which, 286, are, primordial, nuclides, meaning, that, they, have, existed, since, the, solar, system, s, formation, primordial, nuclides, include, 35, nuclides, with, very, long, half, lives, over, 100, million, years, and, 251, that, are, formally, considered, as, stable, nuclides, because, they, have, not, been, observed, to, decay, in, most, cases, for, obvious, reasons, if, an, element, has, stable, isotopes, those, isotopes, predominate, in, the, elemental, abundance, found, on, earth, and, in, the, solar, system, however, in, the, cases, of, three, elements, tellurium, indium, and, rhenium, the, most, abundant, isotope, found, in, nature, is, actually, one, or, two, extremely, long, lived, radioisotope, s, of, the, element, despite, these, elements, having, one, or, more, stable, isotopes, theory, predicts, that, many, apparently, stable, nuclides, are, radioactive, with, extremely, long, half, lives, discounting, the, possibility, of, proton, decay, which, would, make, all, nuclides, ultimately, unstable, some, stable, nuclides, are, in, theory, energetically, susceptible, to, other, known, forms, of, decay, such, as, alpha, decay, or, double, beta, decay, but, no, decay, products, have, yet, been, observed, and, so, these, isotopes, are, said, to, be, observationally, stable, the, predicted, half, lives, for, these, nuclides, often, greatly, exceed, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, and, in, fact, there, are, also, 31, known, radionuclides, see, primordial, nuclide, with, half, lives, longer, than, the, age, of, the, universe, adding, in, the, radioactive, nuclides, that, have, been, created, artificially, there, are, 3, 339, currently, known, nuclides, these, include, 905, nuclides, that, are, either, stable, or, have, half, lives, longer, than, 60, minutes, see, list, of, nuclides, for, details, the, existence, of, isotopes, was, first, suggested, in, 1913, by, the, radiochemist, frederick, soddy, based, on, studies, of, radioactive, decay, chains, that, indicated, about, 40, different, species, referred, to, as, radioelements, i, e, radioactive, elements, between, uranium, and, lead, although, the, periodic, table, only, allowed, for, 11, elements, between, lead, and, uranium, inclusive, several, attempts, to, separate, these, new, radioelements, chemically, had, failed, for, example, soddy, had, shown, in, 1910, that, mesothorium, later, shown, to, be, 228, ra, radium, 226, ra, the, longest, lived, isotope, and, thorium, x, 224, ra, are, impossible, to, separate, attempts, to, place, the, radioelements, in, the, periodic, table, led, soddy, and, kazimierz, fajans, independently, to, propose, their, radioactive, displacement, law, in, 1913, to, the, effect, that, alpha, decay, produced, an, element, two, places, to, the, left, in, the, periodic, table, whereas, beta, decay, emission, produced, an, element, one, place, to, the, right, soddy, recognized, that, emission, of, an, alpha, particle, followed, by, two, beta, particles, led, to, the, formation, of, an, element, chemically, identical, to, the, initial, element, but, with, a, mass, four, units, lighter, and, with, different, radioactive, properties, soddy, proposed, that, several, types, of, atoms, differing, in, radioactive, properties, could, occupy, the, same, place, in, the, table, for, example, the, alpha, decay, of, uranium, 235, forms, thorium, 231, whereas, the, beta, decay, of, actinium, 230, forms, thorium, 230, the, term, isotope, greek, for, at, the, same, place, was, suggested, to, soddy, by, margaret, todd, a, scottish, physician, and, family, friend, during, a, conversation, in, which, he, explained, his, ideas, to, her, he, received, the, 1921, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, part, for, his, work, on, isotopes, in, 1914, t, w, richards, found, variations, between, the, atomic, weight, of, lead, from, different, mineral, sources, attributable, to, variations, in, isotopic, composition, due, to, different, radioactive, origins, the, first, evidence, for, multiple, isotopes, of, a, stable, non, radioactive, element, was, found, by, j, j, thomson, in, 1912, as, part, of, his, exploration, into, the, composition, of, canal, rays, positive, ions, thomson, channelled, streams, of, neon, ions, through, parallel, magnetic, and, electric, fields, measured, their, deflection, by, placing, a, photographic, plate, in, their, path, and, computed, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, using, a, method, that, became, known, as, the, thomson, s, parabola, method, each, stream, created, a, glowing, patch, on, the, plate, at, the, point, it, struck, thomson, observed, two, separate, parabolic, patches, of, light, on, the, photographic, plate, see, image, which, suggested, two, species, of, nuclei, with, different, mass, to, charge, ratios, he, wrote, there, can, therefore, i, think, be, little, doubt, that, what, has, been, called, neon, is, not, a, simple, gas, but, a, mixture, of, two, gases, one, of, which, has, an, atomic, weight, about, 20, and, the, other, about, 22, the, parabola, due, to, the, heavier, gas, is, always, much, fainter, than, that, due, to, the, lighter, so, that, probably, the, heavier, gas, forms, only, a, small, percentage, of, the, mixture, f, w, aston, subsequently, discovered, multiple, stable, isotopes, for, numerous, elements, using, a, mass, spectrograph, in, 1919, aston, studied, neon, with, sufficient, resolution, to, show, that, the, two, isotopic, masses, are, very, close, to, the, integers, 20, and, 22, and, that, neither, is, equal, to, the, known, molar, mass, 20, 2, of, neon, gas, this, is, an, example, of, aston, s, whole, number, rule, for, isotopic, masses, which, states, that, large, deviations, of, elemental, molar, masses, from, integers, are, primarily, due, to, the, fact, that, the, element, is, a, mixture, of, isotopes, aston, similarly, showed, in, 1920, that, the, molar, mass, of, chlorine, 35, 45, is, a, weighted, average, of, the, almost, integral, masses, for, the, two, isotopes, 35, cl, and, 37, cl, after, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, by, james, chadwick, in, 1932, the, ultimate, root, cause, for, the, existence, of, isotopes, was, clarified, that, is, the, nuclei, of, different, isotopes, for, a, given, element, have, different, numbers, of, neutrons, albeit, having, the, same, number, of, protons, a, neutral, atom, has, the, same, number, of, electrons, as, protons, thus, different, isotopes, of, a, given, element, all, have, the, same, number, of, electrons, and, share, a, similar, electronic, structure, because, the, chemical, behavior, of, an, atom, is, largely, determined, by, its, electronic, structure, different, isotopes, exhibit, nearly, identical, chemical, behavior, the, main, exception, to, this, is, the, kinetic, isotope, effect, due, to, their, larger, masses, heavier, isotopes, tend, to, react, somewhat, more, slowly, than, lighter, isotopes, of, the, same, element, this, is, most, pronounced, by, far, for, protium, 1, h, deuterium, 2, h, and, tritium, 3, h, because, deuterium, has, twice, the, mass, of, protium, and, tritium, has, three, times, the, mass, of, protium, these, mass, differences, also, affect, the, behavior, of, their, respective, chemical, bonds, by, changing, the, center, of, gravity, reduced, mass, of, the, atomic, systems, however, for, heavier, elements, the, relative, mass, difference, between, isotopes, is, much, less, so, that, the, mass, difference, effects, on, chemistry, are, usually, negligible, heavy, elements, also, have, relatively, more, neutrons, than, lighter, elements, so, the, ratio, of, the, nuclear, mass, to, the, collective, electronic, mass, is, slightly, greater, there, is, also, an, equilibrium, isotope, effect, similarly, two, molecules, that, differ, only, in, the, isotopes, of, their, atoms, isotopologues, have, identical, electronic, structures, and, therefore, almost, indistinguishable, physical, and, chemical, properties, again, with, deuterium, and, tritium, being, the, primary, exceptions, the, vibrational, modes, of, a, molecule, are, determined, by, its, shape, and, by, the, masses, of, its, constituent, atoms, so, different, isotopologues, have, different, sets, of, vibrational, modes, because, vibrational, modes, allow, a, molecule, to, absorb, photons, of, corresponding, energies, isotopologues, have, different, optical, properties, in, the, infrared, range, atomic, nuclei, consist, of, protons, and, neutrons, bound, together, by, the, residual, strong, force, because, protons, are, positively, charged, they, repel, each, other, neutrons, which, are, electrically, neutral, stabilize, the, nucleus, in, two, ways, their, copresence, pushes, protons, slightly, apart, reducing, the, electrostatic, repulsion, between, the, protons, and, they, exert, the, attractive, nuclear, force, on, each, other, and, on, protons, for, this, reason, one, or, more, neutrons, are, necessary, for, two, or, more, protons, to, bind, into, a, nucleus, as, the, number, of, protons, increases, so, does, the, ratio, of, neutrons, to, protons, necessary, to, ensure, a, stable, nucleus, see, graph, at, right, for, example, although, the, neutron, proton, ratio, of, 3, 2, he, is, 1, 2, the, neutron, proton, ratio, of, 238, 92, u, is, greater, than, 3, 2, a, number, of, lighter, elements, have, stable, nuclides, with, the, ratio, 1, 1, z, n, the, nuclide, 40, 20, ca, calcium, 40, is, observationally, the, heaviest, stable, nuclide, with, the, same, number, of, neutrons, and, protons, all, stable, nuclides, heavier, than, calcium, 40, contain, more, neutrons, than, protons, of, the, 80, elements, with, a, stable, isotope, the, largest, number, of, stable, isotopes, observed, for, any, element, is, ten, for, the, element, tin, no, element, has, nine, or, eight, stable, isotopes, five, elements, have, seven, stable, isotopes, eight, have, six, stable, isotopes, ten, have, five, stable, isotopes, nine, have, four, stable, isotopes, five, have, three, stable, isotopes, 16, have, two, stable, isotopes, counting, 180m, 73, ta, as, stable, and, 26, elements, have, only, a, single, stable, isotope, of, these, 19, are, so, called, mononuclidic, elements, having, a, single, primordial, stable, isotope, that, dominates, and, fixes, the, atomic, weight, of, the, natural, element, to, high, precision, 3, radioactive, mononuclidic, elements, occur, as, well, in, total, there, are, 251, nuclides, that, have, not, been, observed, to, decay, for, the, 80, elements, that, have, one, or, more, stable, isotopes, the, average, number, of, stable, isotopes, is, 251, 80, 3, 14, isotopes, per, element, the, proton, neutron, ratio, is, not, the, only, factor, affecting, nuclear, stability, it, depends, also, on, evenness, or, oddness, of, its, atomic, number, z, neutron, number, n, and, consequently, of, their, sum, the, mass, number, a, oddness, of, both, z, and, n, tends, to, lower, the, nuclear, binding, energy, making, odd, nuclei, generally, less, stable, this, remarkable, difference, of, nuclear, binding, energy, between, neighbouring, nuclei, especially, of, odd, a, isobars, has, important, consequences, unstable, isotopes, with, a, nonoptimal, number, of, neutrons, or, protons, decay, by, beta, decay, including, positron, emission, electron, capture, or, other, less, common, decay, modes, such, as, spontaneous, fission, and, cluster, decay, most, stable, nuclides, are, even, proton, even, neutron, where, all, numbers, z, n, and, a, are, even, the, odd, a, stable, nuclides, are, divided, roughly, evenly, into, odd, proton, even, neutron, and, even, proton, odd, neutron, nuclides, stable, odd, proton, odd, neutron, nuclides, are, the, least, common, the, 146, even, proton, even, neutron, ee, nuclides, comprise, 58, of, all, stable, nuclides, and, all, have, spin, 0, because, of, pairing, there, are, also, 24, primordial, long, lived, even, even, nuclides, as, a, result, each, of, the, 41, even, numbered, elements, from, 2, to, 82, has, at, least, one, stable, isotope, and, most, of, these, elements, have, several, primordial, isotopes, half, of, these, even, numbered, elements, have, six, or, more, stable, isotopes, the, extreme, stability, of, helium, 4, due, to, a, double, pairing, of, 2, protons, and, 2, neutrons, prevents, any, nuclides, containing, five, 5, 2, he, 5, 3, li, or, eight, 8, 4, be, nucleons, from, existing, long, enough, to, serve, as, platforms, for, the, buildup, of, heavier, elements, via, nuclear, fusion, in, stars, see, triple, alpha, process, only, five, stable, nuclides, contain, both, an, odd, number, of, protons, and, an, odd, number, of, neutrons, the, first, four, odd, odd, nuclides, occur, in, low, mass, nuclides, for, which, changing, a, proton, to, a, neutron, or, vice, versa, would, lead, to, a, very, lopsided, proton, neutron, ratio, 2, 1, h, 6, 3, li, 10, 5, b, and, 14, 7, n, spins, 1, 1, 3, 1, the, only, other, entirely, stable, odd, odd, nuclide, 180m, 73, ta, spin, 9, is, thought, to, be, the, rarest, of, the, 251, stable, nuclides, and, is, the, only, primordial, nuclear, isomer, which, has, not, yet, been, observed, to, decay, despite, experimental, attempts, many, odd, odd, radionuclides, such, as, the, ground, state, of, tantalum, 180, with, comparatively, short, half, lives, are, known, usually, they, beta, decay, to, their, nearby, even, even, isobars, that, have, paired, protons, and, paired, neutrons, of, the, nine, primordial, odd, odd, nuclides, five, stable, and, four, radioactive, with, long, half, lives, only, 14, 7, n, is, the, most, common, isotope, of, a, common, element, this, is, the, case, because, it, is, a, part, of, the, cno, cycle, the, nuclides, 6, 3, li, and, 10, 5, b, are, minority, isotopes, of, elements, that, are, themselves, rare, compared, to, other, light, elements, whereas, the, other, six, isotopes, make, up, only, a, tiny, percentage, of, the, natural, abundance, of, their, elements, 53, stable, nuclides, have, an, even, number, of, protons, and, an, odd, number, of, neutrons, they, are, a, minority, in, comparison, to, the, even, even, isotopes, which, are, about, 3, times, as, numerous, among, the, 41, even, z, elements, that, have, a, stable, nuclide, only, two, elements, argon, and, cerium, have, no, even, odd, stable, nuclides, one, element, tin, has, three, there, are, 24, elements, that, have, one, even, odd, nuclide, and, 13, that, have, two, odd, even, nuclides, of, 35, primordial, radionuclides, there, exist, four, even, odd, nuclides, see, table, at, right, including, the, fissile, 235, 92, u, because, of, their, odd, neutron, numbers, the, even, odd, nuclides, tend, to, have, large, neutron, capture, cross, sections, due, to, the, energy, that, results, from, neutron, pairing, effects, these, stable, even, proton, odd, neutron, nuclides, tend, to, be, uncommon, by, abundance, in, nature, generally, because, to, form, and, enter, into, primordial, abundance, they, must, have, escaped, capturing, neutrons, to, form, yet, other, stable, even, even, isotopes, during, both, the, s, process, and, r, process, of, neutron, capture, during, nucleosynthesis, in, stars, for, this, reason, only, 195, 78, pt, and, 9, 4, be, are, the, most, naturally, abundant, isotopes, of, their, element, 48, stable, odd, proton, even, neutron, nuclides, stabilized, by, their, paired, neutrons, form, most, of, the, stable, isotopes, of, the, odd, numbered, elements, the, very, few, odd, proton, odd, neutron, nuclides, comprise, the, others, there, are, 41, odd, numbered, elements, with, z, 1, through, 81, of, which, 39, have, stable, isotopes, technetium, 43, tc, and, promethium, 61, pm, have, no, stable, isotopes, of, these, 39, odd, z, elements, 30, elements, including, hydrogen, 1, where, 0, neutrons, is, even, have, one, stable, odd, even, isotope, and, nine, elements, chlorine, 17, cl, potassium, 19, k, copper, 29, cu, gallium, 31, ga, bromine, 35, br, silver, 47, ag, antimony, 51, sb, iridium, 77, ir, and, thallium, 81, tl, have, two, odd, even, stable, isotopes, each, this, makes, a, total, 30, 2, 9, 48, stable, odd, even, isotopes, there, are, also, five, primordial, long, lived, radioactive, odd, even, isotopes, 87, 37, rb, 115, 49, in, 187, 75, re, 151, 63, eu, and, 209, 83, bi, the, last, two, were, only, recently, found, to, decay, with, half, lives, greater, than, 10, 18, years, actinides, with, odd, neutron, number, are, generally, fissile, with, thermal, neutrons, whereas, those, with, even, neutron, number, are, generally, not, though, they, are, fissionable, with, fast, neutrons, all, observationally, stable, odd, odd, nuclides, have, nonzero, integer, spin, this, is, because, the, single, unpaired, neutron, and, unpaired, proton, have, a, larger, nuclear, force, attraction, to, each, other, if, their, spins, are, aligned, producing, a, total, spin, of, at, least, 1, unit, instead, of, anti, aligned, see, deuterium, for, the, simplest, case, of, this, nuclear, behavior, only, 195, 78, pt, 9, 4, be, and, 14, 7, n, have, odd, neutron, number, and, are, the, most, naturally, abundant, isotope, of, their, element, elements, are, composed, either, of, one, nuclide, mononuclidic, elements, or, of, more, than, one, naturally, occurring, isotopes, the, unstable, radioactive, isotopes, are, either, primordial, or, postprimordial, primordial, isotopes, were, a, product, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, or, another, type, of, nucleosynthesis, such, as, cosmic, ray, spallation, and, have, persisted, down, to, the, present, because, their, rate, of, decay, is, so, slow, e, g, uranium, 238, and, potassium, 40, post, primordial, isotopes, were, created, by, cosmic, ray, bombardment, as, cosmogenic, nuclides, e, g, tritium, carbon, 14, or, by, the, decay, of, a, radioactive, primordial, isotope, to, a, radioactive, radiogenic, nuclide, daughter, e, g, uranium, to, radium, a, few, isotopes, are, naturally, synthesized, as, nucleogenic, nuclides, by, some, other, natural, nuclear, reaction, such, as, when, neutrons, from, natural, nuclear, fission, are, absorbed, by, another, atom, as, discussed, above, only, 80, elements, have, any, stable, isotopes, and, 26, of, these, have, only, one, stable, isotope, thus, about, two, thirds, of, stable, elements, occur, naturally, on, earth, in, multiple, stable, isotopes, with, the, largest, number, of, stable, isotopes, for, an, element, being, ten, for, tin, 50, sn, there, are, about, 94, elements, found, naturally, on, earth, up, to, plutonium, inclusive, though, some, are, detected, only, in, very, tiny, amounts, such, as, plutonium, 244, scientists, estimate, that, the, elements, that, occur, naturally, on, earth, some, only, as, radioisotopes, occur, as, 339, isotopes, nuclides, in, total, only, 251, of, these, naturally, occurring, nuclides, are, stable, in, the, sense, of, never, having, been, observed, to, decay, as, of, the, present, time, an, additional, 35, primordial, nuclides, to, a, total, of, 286, primordial, nuclides, are, radioactive, with, known, half, lives, but, have, half, lives, longer, than, 100, million, years, allowing, them, to, exist, from, the, beginning, of, the, solar, system, see, list, of, nuclides, for, details, all, the, known, stable, nuclides, occur, naturally, on, earth, the, other, naturally, occurring, nuclides, are, radioactive, but, occur, on, earth, due, to, their, relatively, long, half, lives, or, else, due, to, other, means, of, ongoing, natural, production, these, include, the, afore, mentioned, cosmogenic, nuclides, the, nucleogenic, nuclides, and, any, radiogenic, nuclides, formed, by, ongoing, decay, of, a, primordial, radioactive, nuclide, such, as, radon, and, radium, from, uranium, an, additional, 3000, radioactive, nuclides, not, found, in, nature, have, been, created, in, nuclear, reactors, and, in, particle, accelerators, many, short, lived, nuclides, not, found, naturally, on, earth, have, also, been, observed, by, spectroscopic, analysis, being, naturally, created, in, stars, or, supernovae, an, example, is, aluminium, 26, which, is, not, naturally, found, on, earth, but, is, found, in, abundance, on, an, astronomical, scale, the, tabulated, atomic, masses, of, elements, are, averages, that, account, for, the, presence, of, multiple, isotopes, with, different, masses, before, the, discovery, of, isotopes, empirically, determined, noninteger, values, of, atomic, mass, confounded, scientists, for, example, a, sample, of, chlorine, contains, 75, 8, chlorine, 35, and, 24, 2, chlorine, 37, giving, an, average, atomic, mass, of, 35, 5, atomic, mass, units, according, to, generally, accepted, cosmology, theory, only, isotopes, of, hydrogen, and, helium, traces, of, some, isotopes, of, lithium, and, beryllium, and, perhaps, some, boron, were, created, at, the, big, bang, while, all, other, nuclides, were, synthesized, later, in, stars, and, supernovae, and, in, interactions, between, energetic, particles, such, as, cosmic, rays, and, previously, produced, nuclides, see, nucleosynthesis, for, details, of, the, various, processes, thought, responsible, for, isotope, production, the, respective, abundances, of, isotopes, on, earth, result, from, the, quantities, formed, by, these, processes, their, spread, through, the, galaxy, and, the, rates, of, decay, for, isotopes, that, are, unstable, after, the, initial, coalescence, of, the, solar, system, isotopes, were, redistributed, according, to, mass, and, the, isotopic, composition, of, elements, varies, slightly, from, planet, to, planet, this, sometimes, makes, it, possible, to, trace, the, origin, of, meteorites, the, atomic, mass, m, r, of, an, isotope, nuclide, is, determined, mainly, by, its, mass, number, i, e, number, of, nucleons, in, its, nucleus, small, corrections, are, due, to, the, binding, energy, of, the, nucleus, see, mass, defect, the, slight, difference, in, mass, between, proton, and, neutron, and, the, mass, of, the, electrons, associated, with, the, atom, the, latter, because, the, electron, nucleon, ratio, differs, among, isotopes, the, mass, number, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, the, atomic, mass, on, the, other, hand, is, measured, using, the, atomic, mass, unit, based, on, the, mass, of, the, carbon, 12, atom, it, is, denoted, with, symbols, u, for, unified, atomic, mass, unit, or, da, for, dalton, the, atomic, masses, of, naturally, occurring, isotopes, of, an, element, determine, the, standard, atomic, weight, of, the, element, when, the, element, contains, n, isotopes, the, expression, below, is, applied, for, the, average, atomic, mass, m, a, displaystyle, overline, m, a, m, a, m, 1, x, 1, m, 2, x, 2, m, n, x, n, displaystyle, overline, m, a, m, 1, x, 1, m, 2, x, 2, m, n, x, n, where, m, 1, m, 2, m, n, are, the, atomic, masses, of, each, individual, isotope, and, x, 1, x, n, are, the, relative, abundances, of, these, isotopes, several, applications, exist, that, capitalize, on, the, properties, of, the, various, isotopes, of, a, given, element, isotope, separation, is, a, significant, technological, challenge, particularly, with, heavy, elements, such, as, uranium, or, plutonium, lighter, elements, such, as, lithium, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, are, commonly, separated, by, gas, diffusion, of, their, compounds, such, as, co, and, no, the, separation, of, hydrogen, and, deuterium, is, unusual, because, it, is, based, on, chemical, rather, than, physical, properties, for, example, in, the, girdler, sulfide, process, uranium, isotopes, have, been, separated, in, bulk, by, gas, diffusion, gas, centrifugation, laser, ionization, separation, and, in, the, manhattan, project, by, a, type, of, production, mass, spectrometry
