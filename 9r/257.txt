star, formation, is, the, process, by, which, dense, regions, within, molecular, clouds, in, interstellar, space, sometimes, referred, to, as, stellar, nurseries, or, star, forming, regions, collapse, and, form, stars, as, a, branch, of, astronomy, star, formation, includes, the, study, of, the, interstellar, medium, ism, and, giant, molecular, clouds, gmc, as, precursors, to, the, star, formation, process, and, the, study, of, protostars, and, young, stellar, objects, as, its, immediate, products, it, is, closely, related, to, planet, formation, another, branch, of, astronomy, star, formation, theory, as, well, as, accounting, for, the, formation, of, a, single, star, must, also, account, for, the, statistics, of, binary, stars, and, the, initial, mass, function, most, stars, do, not, form, in, isolation, but, as, part, of, a, group, of, stars, referred, as, star, clusters, or, stellar, associations, the, first, stars, were, formed, 12, 13, billion, years, ago, following, the, big, bang, over, intervals, of, time, stars, have, fused, helium, to, form, a, series, of, chemical, elements, spiral, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, contain, stars, stellar, remnants, and, a, diffuse, interstellar, medium, ism, of, gas, and, dust, the, interstellar, medium, consists, of, 10, 4, to, 10, 6, particles, per, cm, 3, and, is, typically, composed, of, roughly, 70, hydrogen, 28, helium, and, 1, 5, heavier, elements, by, mass, the, trace, amounts, of, heavier, elements, were, and, are, produced, within, stars, via, stellar, nucleosynthesis, and, ejected, as, the, stars, pass, beyond, the, end, of, their, main, sequence, lifetime, higher, density, regions, of, the, interstellar, medium, form, clouds, or, diffuse, nebulae, where, star, formation, takes, place, in, contrast, to, spiral, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, lose, the, cold, component, of, its, interstellar, medium, within, roughly, a, billion, years, which, hinders, the, galaxy, from, forming, diffuse, nebulae, except, through, mergers, with, other, galaxies, in, the, dense, nebulae, where, stars, are, produced, much, of, the, hydrogen, is, in, the, molecular, h, 2, form, so, these, nebulae, are, called, molecular, clouds, the, herschel, space, observatory, has, revealed, that, filaments, or, elongated, dense, gas, structures, are, truly, ubiquitous, in, molecular, clouds, and, central, to, the, star, formation, process, they, fragment, into, gravitationally, bound, cores, most, of, which, will, evolve, into, stars, continuous, accretion, of, gas, geometrical, bending, and, magnetic, fields, may, control, the, detailed, manner, in, which, the, filaments, are, fragmented, observations, of, supercritical, filaments, have, revealed, quasi, periodic, chains, of, dense, cores, with, spacing, comparable, to, the, filament, inner, width, and, embedded, protostars, with, outflows, observations, indicate, that, the, coldest, clouds, tend, to, form, low, mass, stars, which, are, first, observed, via, the, infrared, light, they, emit, inside, the, clouds, and, then, as, visible, light, when, the, clouds, dissipate, giant, molecular, clouds, which, are, generally, warmer, produce, stars, of, all, masses, these, giant, molecular, clouds, have, typical, densities, of, 100, particles, per, cm, 3, diameters, of, 100, light, years, 9, 5, 10, 14, km, masses, of, up, to, 6, million, solar, masses, m, or, six, million, times, the, mass, of, earth, s, sun, the, average, interior, temperature, is, 10, k, 441, 7, f, about, half, the, total, mass, of, the, milky, way, s, galactic, ism, is, found, in, molecular, clouds, and, the, galaxy, includes, an, estimated, 6, 000, molecular, clouds, each, with, more, than, 100, 000, m, the, nebula, nearest, to, the, sun, where, massive, stars, are, being, formed, is, the, orion, nebula, 1, 300, light, years, 1, 2, 10, 16, km, away, however, lower, mass, star, formation, is, occurring, about, 400, 450, light, years, distant, in, the, ophiuchi, cloud, complex, a, more, compact, site, of, star, formation, is, the, opaque, clouds, of, dense, gas, and, dust, known, as, bok, globules, so, named, after, the, astronomer, bart, bok, these, can, form, in, association, with, collapsing, molecular, clouds, or, possibly, independently, the, bok, globules, are, typically, up, to, a, light, year, across, and, contain, a, few, solar, masses, they, can, be, observed, as, dark, clouds, silhouetted, against, bright, emission, nebulae, or, background, stars, over, half, the, known, bok, globules, have, been, found, to, contain, newly, forming, stars, an, interstellar, cloud, of, gas, will, remain, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, as, long, as, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, gas, pressure, is, in, balance, with, the, potential, energy, of, the, internal, gravitational, force, mathematically, this, is, expressed, using, the, virial, theorem, which, states, that, to, maintain, equilibrium, the, gravitational, potential, energy, must, equal, twice, the, internal, thermal, energy, if, a, cloud, is, massive, enough, that, the, gas, pressure, is, insufficient, to, support, it, the, cloud, will, undergo, gravitational, collapse, the, mass, above, which, a, cloud, will, undergo, such, collapse, is, called, the, jeans, mass, the, jeans, mass, depends, on, the, temperature, and, density, of, the, cloud, but, is, typically, thousands, to, tens, of, thousands, of, solar, masses, during, cloud, collapse, dozens, to, tens, of, thousands, of, stars, form, more, or, less, simultaneously, which, is, observable, in, so, called, embedded, clusters, the, end, product, of, a, core, collapse, is, an, open, cluster, of, stars, in, triggered, star, formation, one, of, several, events, might, occur, to, compress, a, molecular, cloud, and, initiate, its, gravitational, collapse, molecular, clouds, may, collide, with, each, other, or, a, nearby, supernova, explosion, can, be, a, trigger, sending, shocked, matter, into, the, cloud, at, very, high, speeds, the, resulting, new, stars, may, themselves, soon, produce, supernovae, producing, self, propagating, star, formation, alternatively, galactic, collisions, can, trigger, massive, starbursts, of, star, formation, as, the, gas, clouds, in, each, galaxy, are, compressed, and, agitated, by, tidal, forces, the, latter, mechanism, may, be, responsible, for, the, formation, of, globular, clusters, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, core, of, a, galaxy, may, serve, to, regulate, the, rate, of, star, formation, in, a, galactic, nucleus, a, black, hole, that, is, accreting, infalling, matter, can, become, active, emitting, a, strong, wind, through, a, collimated, relativistic, jet, this, can, limit, further, star, formation, massive, black, holes, ejecting, radio, frequency, emitting, particles, at, near, light, speed, can, also, block, the, formation, of, new, stars, in, aging, galaxies, however, the, radio, emissions, around, the, jets, may, also, trigger, star, formation, likewise, a, weaker, jet, may, trigger, star, formation, when, it, collides, with, a, cloud, as, it, collapses, a, molecular, cloud, breaks, into, smaller, and, smaller, pieces, in, a, hierarchical, manner, until, the, fragments, reach, stellar, mass, in, each, of, these, fragments, the, collapsing, gas, radiates, away, the, energy, gained, by, the, release, of, gravitational, potential, energy, as, the, density, increases, the, fragments, become, opaque, and, are, thus, less, efficient, at, radiating, away, their, energy, this, raises, the, temperature, of, the, cloud, and, inhibits, further, fragmentation, the, fragments, now, condense, into, rotating, spheres, of, gas, that, serve, as, stellar, embryos, complicating, this, picture, of, a, collapsing, cloud, are, the, effects, of, turbulence, macroscopic, flows, rotation, magnetic, fields, and, the, cloud, geometry, both, rotation, and, magnetic, fields, can, hinder, the, collapse, of, a, cloud, turbulence, is, instrumental, in, causing, fragmentation, of, the, cloud, and, on, the, smallest, scales, it, promotes, collapse, a, protostellar, cloud, will, continue, to, collapse, as, long, as, the, gravitational, binding, energy, can, be, eliminated, this, excess, energy, is, primarily, lost, through, radiation, however, the, collapsing, cloud, will, eventually, become, opaque, to, its, own, radiation, and, the, energy, must, be, removed, through, some, other, means, the, dust, within, the, cloud, becomes, heated, to, temperatures, of, 60, 100, k, and, these, particles, radiate, at, wavelengths, in, the, far, infrared, where, the, cloud, is, transparent, thus, the, dust, mediates, the, further, collapse, of, the, cloud, during, the, collapse, the, density, of, the, cloud, increases, towards, the, center, and, thus, the, middle, region, becomes, optically, opaque, first, this, occurs, when, the, density, is, about, 10, 13, g, cm, 3, a, core, region, called, the, first, hydrostatic, core, forms, where, the, collapse, is, essentially, halted, it, continues, to, increase, in, temperature, as, determined, by, the, virial, theorem, the, gas, falling, toward, this, opaque, region, collides, with, it, and, creates, shock, waves, that, further, heat, the, core, when, the, core, temperature, reaches, about, 2000, k, the, thermal, energy, dissociates, the, h, 2, molecules, this, is, followed, by, the, ionization, of, the, hydrogen, and, helium, atoms, these, processes, absorb, the, energy, of, the, contraction, allowing, it, to, continue, on, timescales, comparable, to, the, period, of, collapse, at, free, fall, velocities, after, the, density, of, infalling, material, has, reached, about, 10, 8, g, cm, 3, that, material, is, sufficiently, transparent, to, allow, energy, radiated, by, the, protostar, to, escape, the, combination, of, convection, within, the, protostar, and, radiation, from, its, exterior, allow, the, star, to, contract, further, this, continues, until, the, gas, is, hot, enough, for, the, internal, pressure, to, support, the, protostar, against, further, gravitational, collapse, a, state, called, hydrostatic, equilibrium, when, this, accretion, phase, is, nearly, complete, the, resulting, object, is, known, as, a, protostar, accretion, of, material, onto, the, protostar, continues, partially, from, the, newly, formed, circumstellar, disc, when, the, density, and, temperature, are, high, enough, deuterium, fusion, begins, and, the, outward, pressure, of, the, resultant, radiation, slows, but, does, not, stop, the, collapse, material, comprising, the, cloud, continues, to, rain, onto, the, protostar, in, this, stage, bipolar, jets, are, produced, called, herbig, haro, objects, this, is, probably, the, means, by, which, excess, angular, momentum, of, the, infalling, material, is, expelled, allowing, the, star, to, continue, to, form, when, the, surrounding, gas, and, dust, envelope, disperses, and, accretion, process, stops, the, star, is, considered, a, pre, main, sequence, star, pms, star, the, energy, source, of, these, objects, is, gravitational, contraction, kelvin, helmholtz, mechanism, as, opposed, to, hydrogen, burning, in, main, sequence, stars, the, pms, star, follows, a, hayashi, track, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, h, r, diagram, the, contraction, will, proceed, until, the, hayashi, limit, is, reached, and, thereafter, contraction, will, continue, on, a, kelvin, helmholtz, timescale, with, the, temperature, remaining, stable, stars, with, less, than, 0, 5, m, thereafter, join, the, main, sequence, for, more, massive, pms, stars, at, the, end, of, the, hayashi, track, they, will, slowly, collapse, in, near, hydrostatic, equilibrium, following, the, henyey, track, finally, hydrogen, begins, to, fuse, in, the, core, of, the, star, and, the, rest, of, the, enveloping, material, is, cleared, away, this, ends, the, protostellar, phase, and, begins, the, star, s, main, sequence, phase, on, the, h, r, diagram, the, stages, of, the, process, are, well, defined, in, stars, with, masses, around, 1, m, or, less, in, high, mass, stars, the, length, of, the, star, formation, process, is, comparable, to, the, other, timescales, of, their, evolution, much, shorter, and, the, process, is, not, so, well, defined, the, later, evolution, of, stars, is, studied, in, stellar, evolution, key, elements, of, star, formation, are, only, available, by, observing, in, wavelengths, other, than, the, optical, the, protostellar, stage, of, stellar, existence, is, almost, invariably, hidden, away, deep, inside, dense, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, left, over, from, the, gmc, often, these, star, forming, cocoons, known, as, bok, globules, can, be, seen, in, silhouette, against, bright, emission, from, surrounding, gas, early, stages, of, a, star, s, life, can, be, seen, in, infrared, light, which, penetrates, the, dust, more, easily, than, visible, light, observations, from, the, wide, field, infrared, survey, explorer, wise, have, thus, been, especially, important, for, unveiling, numerous, galactic, protostars, and, their, parent, star, clusters, examples, of, such, embedded, star, clusters, are, fsr, 1184, fsr, 1190, camargo, 14, camargo, 74, majaess, 64, and, majaess, 98, the, structure, of, the, molecular, cloud, and, the, effects, of, the, protostar, can, be, observed, in, near, ir, extinction, maps, where, the, number, of, stars, are, counted, per, unit, area, and, compared, to, a, nearby, zero, extinction, area, of, sky, continuum, dust, emission, and, rotational, transitions, of, co, and, other, molecules, these, last, two, are, observed, in, the, millimeter, and, submillimeter, range, the, radiation, from, the, protostar, and, early, star, has, to, be, observed, in, infrared, astronomy, wavelengths, as, the, extinction, caused, by, the, rest, of, the, cloud, in, which, the, star, is, forming, is, usually, too, big, to, allow, us, to, observe, it, in, the, visual, part, of, the, spectrum, this, presents, considerable, difficulties, as, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, almost, entirely, opaque, from, 20, m, to, 850, m, with, narrow, windows, at, 200, m, and, 450, m, even, outside, this, range, atmospheric, subtraction, techniques, must, be, used, x, ray, observations, have, proven, useful, for, studying, young, stars, since, x, ray, emission, from, these, objects, is, about, 100, 100, 000, times, stronger, than, x, ray, emission, from, main, sequence, stars, the, earliest, detections, of, x, rays, from, t, tauri, stars, were, made, by, the, einstein, x, ray, observatory, for, low, mass, stars, x, rays, are, generated, by, the, heating, of, the, stellar, corona, through, magnetic, reconnection, while, for, high, mass, o, and, early, b, type, stars, x, rays, are, generated, through, supersonic, shocks, in, the, stellar, winds, photons, in, the, soft, x, ray, energy, range, covered, by, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, and, xmm, newton, may, penetrate, the, interstellar, medium, with, only, moderate, absorption, due, to, gas, making, the, x, ray, a, useful, wavelength, for, seeing, the, stellar, populations, within, molecular, clouds, x, ray, emission, as, evidence, of, stellar, youth, makes, this, band, particularly, useful, for, performing, censuses, of, stars, in, star, forming, regions, given, that, not, all, young, stars, have, infrared, excesses, x, ray, observations, have, provided, near, complete, censuses, of, all, stellar, mass, objects, in, the, orion, nebula, cluster, and, taurus, molecular, cloud, the, formation, of, individual, stars, can, only, be, directly, observed, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, but, in, distant, galaxies, star, formation, has, been, detected, through, its, unique, spectral, signature, initial, research, indicates, star, forming, clumps, start, as, giant, dense, areas, in, turbulent, gas, rich, matter, in, young, galaxies, live, about, 500, million, years, and, may, migrate, to, the, center, of, a, galaxy, creating, the, central, bulge, of, a, galaxy, on, february, 21, 2014, nasa, announced, a, greatly, upgraded, database, for, tracking, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, in, the, universe, according, to, scientists, more, than, 20, of, the, carbon, in, the, universe, may, be, associated, with, pahs, possible, starting, materials, for, the, formation, of, life, pahs, seem, to, have, been, formed, shortly, after, the, big, bang, are, widespread, throughout, the, universe, and, are, associated, with, new, stars, and, exoplanets, in, february, 2018, astronomers, reported, for, the, first, time, a, signal, of, the, reionization, epoch, an, indirect, detection, of, light, from, the, earliest, stars, formed, about, 180, million, years, after, the, big, bang, an, article, published, on, october, 22, 2019, reported, on, the, detection, of, 3mm, 1, a, massive, star, forming, galaxy, about, 12, 5, billion, light, years, away, that, is, obscured, by, clouds, of, dust, at, a, mass, of, about, 10, 10, 8, solar, masses, it, showed, a, star, formation, rate, about, 100, times, as, high, as, in, the, milky, way, stars, of, different, masses, are, thought, to, form, by, slightly, different, mechanisms, the, theory, of, low, mass, star, formation, which, is, well, supported, by, observation, suggests, that, low, mass, stars, form, by, the, gravitational, collapse, of, rotating, density, enhancements, within, molecular, clouds, as, described, above, the, collapse, of, a, rotating, cloud, of, gas, and, dust, leads, to, the, formation, of, an, accretion, disk, through, which, matter, is, channeled, onto, a, central, protostar, for, stars, with, masses, higher, than, about, 8, m, however, the, mechanism, of, star, formation, is, not, well, understood, massive, stars, emit, copious, quantities, of, radiation, which, pushes, against, infalling, material, in, the, past, it, was, thought, that, this, radiation, pressure, might, be, substantial, enough, to, halt, accretion, onto, the, massive, protostar, and, prevent, the, formation, of, stars, with, masses, more, than, a, few, tens, of, solar, masses, recent, theoretical, work, has, shown, that, the, production, of, a, jet, and, outflow, clears, a, cavity, through, which, much, of, the, radiation, from, a, massive, protostar, can, escape, without, hindering, accretion, through, the, disk, and, onto, the, protostar, present, thinking, is, that, massive, stars, may, therefore, be, able, to, form, by, a, mechanism, similar, to, that, by, which, low, mass, stars, form, there, is, mounting, evidence, that, at, least, some, massive, protostars, are, indeed, surrounded, by, accretion, disks, disk, accretion, in, high, mass, protostars, similar, to, their, low, mass, counterparts, is, expected, to, exhibit, bursts, of, episodic, accretion, as, a, result, of, a, gravitationally, instability, leading, to, clumpy, and, in, continuous, accretion, rates, recent, evidence, of, accretion, bursts, in, high, mass, protostars, has, indeed, been, confirmed, observationally, several, other, theories, of, massive, star, formation, remain, to, be, tested, observationally, of, these, perhaps, the, most, prominent, is, the, theory, of, competitive, accretion, which, suggests, that, massive, protostars, are, seeded, by, low, mass, protostars, which, compete, with, other, protostars, to, draw, in, matter, from, the, entire, parent, molecular, cloud, instead, of, simply, from, a, small, local, region, another, theory, of, massive, star, formation, suggests, that, massive, stars, may, form, by, the, coalescence, of, two, or, more, stars, of, lower, mass, recent, studies, have, emphasized, the, role, of, filamentary, structures, in, molecular, clouds, as, the, initial, conditions, for, star, formation, findings, from, the, herschel, space, observatory, highlight, the, ubiquitous, nature, of, these, filaments, in, the, cold, interstellar, medium, ism, the, spatial, relationship, between, cores, and, filaments, indicates, that, the, majority, of, prestellar, cores, are, located, within, 0, 1, pc, of, supercritical, filaments, this, supports, the, hypothesis, that, filamentary, structures, act, as, pathways, for, the, accumulation, of, gas, and, dust, leading, to, core, formation, both, the, core, mass, function, cmf, and, filament, line, mass, function, flmf, observed, in, the, california, gmc, follow, power, law, distributions, at, the, high, mass, end, consistent, with, the, salpeter, initial, mass, function, imf, current, results, strongly, support, the, existence, of, a, connection, between, the, flmf, and, the, cmf, imf, demonstrating, that, this, connection, holds, at, the, level, of, an, individual, cloud, specifically, the, california, gmc, the, flmf, presented, is, a, distribution, of, local, line, masses, for, a, complete, homogeneous, sample, of, filaments, within, the, same, cloud, it, is, the, local, line, mass, of, a, filament, that, defines, its, ability, to, fragment, at, a, particular, location, along, its, spine, not, the, average, line, mass, of, the, filament, this, connection, is, more, direct, and, provides, tighter, constraints, on, the, origin, of, the, cmf, imf
