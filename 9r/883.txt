plasma, from, ancient, greek, pl, sma, moldable, substance, is, one, of, four, fundamental, states, of, matter, the, other, three, being, solid, liquid, and, gas, characterized, by, the, presence, of, a, significant, portion, of, charged, particles, in, any, combination, of, ions, or, electrons, it, is, the, most, abundant, form, of, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, mostly, in, stars, including, the, sun, but, also, dominating, the, rarefied, intracluster, medium, and, intergalactic, medium, plasma, can, be, artificially, generated, for, example, by, heating, a, neutral, gas, or, subjecting, it, to, a, strong, electromagnetic, field, the, presence, of, charged, particles, makes, plasma, electrically, conductive, with, the, dynamics, of, individual, particles, and, macroscopic, plasma, motion, governed, by, collective, electromagnetic, fields, and, very, sensitive, to, externally, applied, fields, the, response, of, plasma, to, electromagnetic, fields, is, used, in, many, modern, devices, and, technologies, such, as, plasma, televisions, or, plasma, etching, depending, on, temperature, and, density, a, certain, number, of, neutral, particles, may, also, be, present, in, which, case, plasma, is, called, partially, ionized, neon, signs, and, lightning, are, examples, of, partially, ionized, plasmas, unlike, the, phase, transitions, between, the, other, three, states, of, matter, the, transition, to, plasma, is, not, well, defined, and, is, a, matter, of, interpretation, and, context, whether, a, given, degree, of, ionization, suffices, to, call, a, substance, plasma, depends, on, the, specific, phenomenon, being, considered, plasma, was, first, identified, in, laboratory, by, sir, william, crookes, crookes, presented, a, lecture, on, what, he, called, radiant, matter, to, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, in, sheffield, on, friday, 22, august, 1879, systematic, studies, of, plasma, began, with, the, research, of, irving, langmuir, and, his, colleagues, in, the, 1920s, langmuir, also, introduced, the, term, plasma, as, a, description, of, ionized, gas, in, 1928, except, near, the, electrodes, where, there, are, sheaths, containing, very, few, electrons, the, ionized, gas, contains, ions, and, electrons, in, about, equal, numbers, so, that, the, resultant, space, charge, is, very, small, we, shall, use, the, name, plasma, to, describe, this, region, containing, balanced, charges, of, ions, and, electrons, lewi, tonks, and, harold, mott, smith, both, of, whom, worked, with, langmuir, in, the, 1920s, recall, that, langmuir, first, used, the, term, by, analogy, with, the, blood, plasma, mott, smith, recalls, in, particular, that, the, transport, of, electrons, from, thermionic, filaments, reminded, langmuir, of, the, way, blood, plasma, carries, red, and, white, corpuscles, and, germs, plasma, is, called, the, fourth, state, of, matter, after, solid, liquid, and, gas, it, is, a, state, of, matter, in, which, an, ionized, substance, becomes, highly, electrically, conductive, to, the, point, that, long, range, electric, and, magnetic, fields, dominate, its, behaviour, plasma, is, typically, an, electrically, quasineutral, medium, of, unbound, positive, and, negative, particles, i, e, the, overall, charge, of, a, plasma, is, roughly, zero, although, these, particles, are, unbound, they, are, not, free, in, the, sense, of, not, experiencing, forces, moving, charged, particles, generate, electric, currents, and, any, movement, of, a, charged, plasma, particle, affects, and, is, affected, by, the, fields, created, by, the, other, charges, in, turn, this, governs, collective, behaviour, with, many, degrees, of, variation, plasma, is, distinct, from, the, other, states, of, matter, in, particular, describing, a, low, density, plasma, as, merely, an, ionized, gas, is, wrong, and, misleading, even, though, it, is, similar, to, the, gas, phase, in, that, both, assume, no, definite, shape, or, volume, the, following, table, summarizes, some, principal, differences, three, factors, define, an, ideal, plasma, the, strength, and, range, of, the, electric, force, and, the, good, conductivity, of, plasmas, usually, ensure, that, the, densities, of, positive, and, negative, charges, in, any, sizeable, region, are, equal, quasineutrality, a, plasma, with, a, significant, excess, of, charge, density, or, in, the, extreme, case, is, composed, of, a, single, species, is, called, a, non, neutral, plasma, in, such, a, plasma, electric, fields, play, a, dominant, role, examples, are, charged, particle, beams, an, electron, cloud, in, a, penning, trap, and, positron, plasmas, a, dusty, plasma, contains, tiny, charged, particles, of, dust, typically, found, in, space, the, dust, particles, acquire, high, charges, and, interact, with, each, other, a, plasma, that, contains, larger, particles, is, called, grain, plasma, under, laboratory, conditions, dusty, plasmas, are, also, called, complex, plasmas, for, plasma, to, exist, ionization, is, necessary, the, term, plasma, density, by, itself, usually, refers, to, the, electron, density, n, e, displaystyle, n, e, that, is, the, number, of, charge, contributing, electrons, per, unit, volume, the, degree, of, ionization, displaystyle, alpha, is, defined, as, fraction, of, neutral, particles, that, are, ionized, n, i, n, i, n, n, displaystyle, alpha, frac, n, i, n, i, n, n, where, n, i, displaystyle, n, i, is, the, ion, density, and, n, n, displaystyle, n, n, the, neutral, density, in, number, of, particles, per, unit, volume, in, the, case, of, fully, ionized, matter, 1, displaystyle, alpha, 1, because, of, the, quasineutrality, of, plasma, the, electron, and, ion, densities, are, related, by, n, e, z, i, n, i, displaystyle, n, e, langle, z, i, rangle, n, i, where, z, i, displaystyle, langle, z, i, rangle, is, the, average, ion, charge, in, units, of, the, elementary, charge, plasma, temperature, commonly, measured, in, kelvin, or, electronvolts, is, a, measure, of, the, thermal, kinetic, energy, per, particle, high, temperatures, are, usually, needed, to, sustain, ionization, which, is, a, defining, feature, of, a, plasma, the, degree, of, plasma, ionization, is, determined, by, the, electron, temperature, relative, to, the, ionization, energy, and, more, weakly, by, the, density, in, thermal, equilibrium, the, relationship, is, given, by, the, saha, equation, at, low, temperatures, ions, and, electrons, tend, to, recombine, into, bound, states, atoms, and, the, plasma, will, eventually, become, a, gas, in, most, cases, the, electrons, and, heavy, plasma, particles, ions, and, neutral, atoms, separately, have, a, relatively, well, defined, temperature, that, is, their, energy, distribution, function, is, close, to, a, maxwellian, even, in, the, presence, of, strong, electric, or, magnetic, fields, however, because, of, the, large, difference, in, mass, between, electrons, and, ions, their, temperatures, may, be, different, sometimes, significantly, so, this, is, especially, common, in, weakly, ionized, technological, plasmas, where, the, ions, are, often, near, the, ambient, temperature, while, electrons, reach, thousands, of, kelvin, the, opposite, case, is, the, z, pinch, plasma, where, the, ion, temperature, may, exceed, that, of, electrons, since, plasmas, are, very, good, electrical, conductors, electric, potentials, play, an, important, role, the, average, potential, in, the, space, between, charged, particles, independent, of, how, it, can, be, measured, is, called, the, plasma, potential, or, the, space, potential, if, an, electrode, is, inserted, into, a, plasma, its, potential, will, generally, lie, considerably, below, the, plasma, potential, due, to, what, is, termed, a, debye, sheath, the, good, electrical, conductivity, of, plasmas, makes, their, electric, fields, very, small, this, results, in, the, important, concept, of, quasineutrality, which, says, the, density, of, negative, charges, is, approximately, equal, to, the, density, of, positive, charges, over, large, volumes, of, the, plasma, n, e, z, n, i, displaystyle, n, e, langle, z, rangle, n, i, but, on, the, scale, of, the, debye, length, there, can, be, charge, imbalance, in, the, special, case, that, double, layers, are, formed, the, charge, separation, can, extend, some, tens, of, debye, lengths, the, magnitude, of, the, potentials, and, electric, fields, must, be, determined, by, means, other, than, simply, finding, the, net, charge, density, a, common, example, is, to, assume, that, the, electrons, satisfy, the, boltzmann, relation, n, e, exp, e, k, b, t, e, displaystyle, n, e, propto, exp, e, phi, k, text, b, t, e, differentiating, this, relation, provides, a, means, to, calculate, the, electric, field, from, the, density, e, k, b, t, e, e, n, e, n, e, displaystyle, vec, e, frac, k, text, b, t, e, e, frac, nabla, n, e, n, e, it, is, possible, to, produce, a, plasma, that, is, not, quasineutral, an, electron, beam, for, example, has, only, negative, charges, the, density, of, a, non, neutral, plasma, must, generally, be, very, low, or, it, must, be, very, small, otherwise, it, will, be, dissipated, by, the, repulsive, electrostatic, force, the, existence, of, charged, particles, causes, the, plasma, to, generate, and, be, affected, by, magnetic, fields, plasma, with, a, magnetic, field, strong, enough, to, influence, the, motion, of, the, charged, particles, is, said, to, be, magnetized, a, common, quantitative, criterion, is, that, a, particle, on, average, completes, at, least, one, gyration, around, the, magnetic, field, line, before, making, a, collision, i, e, c, e, c, o, l, l, 1, displaystyle, nu, mathrm, ce, nu, mathrm, coll, 1, where, c, e, displaystyle, nu, mathrm, ce, is, the, electron, gyrofrequency, and, c, o, l, l, displaystyle, nu, mathrm, coll, is, the, electron, collision, rate, it, is, often, the, case, that, the, electrons, are, magnetized, while, the, ions, are, not, magnetized, plasmas, are, anisotropic, meaning, that, their, properties, in, the, direction, parallel, to, the, magnetic, field, are, different, from, those, perpendicular, to, it, while, electric, fields, in, plasmas, are, usually, small, due, to, the, plasma, high, conductivity, the, electric, field, associated, with, a, plasma, moving, with, velocity, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, in, the, magnetic, field, b, displaystyle, mathbf, b, is, given, by, the, usual, lorentz, formula, e, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, and, is, not, affected, by, debye, shielding, to, completely, describe, the, state, of, a, plasma, all, of, the, particle, locations, and, velocities, that, describe, the, electromagnetic, field, in, the, plasma, region, would, need, to, be, written, down, however, it, is, generally, not, practical, or, necessary, to, keep, track, of, all, the, particles, in, a, plasma, therefore, plasma, physicists, commonly, use, less, detailed, descriptions, of, which, there, are, two, main, types, fluid, models, describe, plasmas, in, terms, of, smoothed, quantities, like, density, and, averaged, velocity, around, each, position, see, plasma, parameters, one, simple, fluid, model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats, the, plasma, as, a, single, fluid, governed, by, a, combination, of, maxwell, s, equations, and, the, navier, stokes, equations, a, more, general, description, is, the, two, fluid, plasma, where, the, ions, and, electrons, are, described, separately, fluid, models, are, often, accurate, when, collisionality, is, sufficiently, high, to, keep, the, plasma, velocity, distribution, close, to, a, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, because, fluid, models, usually, describe, the, plasma, in, terms, of, a, single, flow, at, a, certain, temperature, at, each, spatial, location, they, can, neither, capture, velocity, space, structures, like, beams, or, double, layers, nor, resolve, wave, particle, effects, kinetic, models, describe, the, particle, velocity, distribution, function, at, each, point, in, the, plasma, and, therefore, do, not, need, to, assume, a, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, a, kinetic, description, is, often, necessary, for, collisionless, plasmas, there, are, two, common, approaches, to, kinetic, description, of, a, plasma, one, is, based, on, representing, the, smoothed, distribution, function, on, a, grid, in, velocity, and, position, the, other, known, as, the, particle, in, cell, pic, technique, includes, kinetic, information, by, following, the, trajectories, of, a, large, number, of, individual, particles, kinetic, models, are, generally, more, computationally, intensive, than, fluid, models, the, vlasov, equation, may, be, used, to, describe, the, dynamics, of, a, system, of, charged, particles, interacting, with, an, electromagnetic, field, in, magnetized, plasmas, a, gyrokinetic, approach, can, substantially, reduce, the, computational, expense, of, a, fully, kinetic, simulation, plasmas, are, studied, by, the, vast, academic, field, of, plasma, science, or, plasma, physics, including, several, sub, disciplines, such, as, space, plasma, physics, plasmas, can, appear, in, nature, in, various, forms, and, locations, with, a, few, examples, given, in, the, following, table, plasmas, are, by, far, the, most, common, phase, of, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, both, by, mass, and, by, volume, above, the, earth, s, surface, the, ionosphere, is, a, plasma, and, the, magnetosphere, contains, plasma, within, our, solar, system, interplanetary, space, is, filled, with, the, plasma, expelled, via, the, solar, wind, extending, from, the, sun, s, surface, out, to, the, heliopause, furthermore, all, the, distant, stars, and, much, of, interstellar, space, or, intergalactic, space, is, also, filled, with, plasma, albeit, at, very, low, densities, astrophysical, plasmas, are, also, observed, in, accretion, disks, around, stars, or, compact, objects, like, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, or, black, holes, in, close, binary, star, systems, plasma, is, associated, with, ejection, of, material, in, astrophysical, jets, which, have, been, observed, with, accreting, black, holes, or, in, active, galaxies, like, m87, s, jet, that, possibly, extends, out, to, 5, 000, light, years, most, artificial, plasmas, are, generated, by, the, application, of, electric, and, or, magnetic, fields, through, a, gas, plasma, generated, in, a, laboratory, setting, and, for, industrial, use, can, be, generally, categorized, by, just, like, the, many, uses, of, plasma, there, are, several, means, for, its, generation, however, one, principle, is, common, to, all, of, them, there, must, be, energy, input, to, produce, and, sustain, it, for, this, case, plasma, is, generated, when, an, electric, current, is, applied, across, a, dielectric, gas, or, fluid, an, electrically, non, conducting, material, as, can, be, seen, in, the, adjacent, image, which, shows, a, discharge, tube, as, a, simple, example, dc, used, for, simplicity, the, potential, difference, and, subsequent, electric, field, pull, the, bound, electrons, negative, toward, the, anode, positive, electrode, while, the, cathode, negative, electrode, pulls, the, nucleus, as, the, voltage, increases, the, current, stresses, the, material, by, electric, polarization, beyond, its, dielectric, limit, termed, strength, into, a, stage, of, electrical, breakdown, marked, by, an, electric, spark, where, the, material, transforms, from, being, an, insulator, into, a, conductor, as, it, becomes, increasingly, ionized, the, underlying, process, is, the, townsend, avalanche, where, collisions, between, electrons, and, neutral, gas, atoms, create, more, ions, and, electrons, as, can, be, seen, in, the, figure, on, the, right, the, first, impact, of, an, electron, on, an, atom, results, in, one, ion, and, two, electrons, therefore, the, number, of, charged, particles, increases, rapidly, in, the, millions, only, after, about, 20, successive, sets, of, collisions, mainly, due, to, a, small, mean, free, path, average, distance, travelled, between, collisions, electric, arc, is, a, continuous, electric, discharge, between, two, electrodes, similar, to, lightning, with, ample, current, density, the, discharge, forms, a, luminous, arc, where, the, inter, electrode, material, usually, a, gas, undergoes, various, stages, saturation, breakdown, glow, transition, and, thermal, arc, the, voltage, rises, to, its, maximum, in, the, saturation, stage, and, thereafter, it, undergoes, fluctuations, of, the, various, stages, while, the, current, progressively, increases, throughout, electrical, resistance, along, the, arc, creates, heat, which, dissociates, more, gas, molecules, and, ionizes, the, resulting, atoms, therefore, the, electrical, energy, is, given, to, electrons, which, due, to, their, great, mobility, and, large, numbers, are, able, to, disperse, it, rapidly, by, elastic, collisions, to, the, heavy, particles, plasmas, find, applications, in, many, fields, of, research, technology, and, industry, for, example, in, industrial, and, extractive, metallurgy, surface, treatments, such, as, plasma, spraying, coating, etching, in, microelectronics, metal, cutting, and, welding, as, well, as, in, everyday, vehicle, exhaust, cleanup, and, fluorescent, luminescent, lamps, fuel, ignition, and, even, in, supersonic, combustion, engines, for, aerospace, engineering, a, world, effort, was, triggered, in, the, 1960s, to, study, magnetohydrodynamic, converters, in, order, to, bring, mhd, power, conversion, to, market, with, commercial, power, plants, of, a, new, kind, converting, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, high, velocity, plasma, into, electricity, with, no, moving, parts, at, a, high, efficiency, research, was, also, conducted, in, the, field, of, supersonic, and, hypersonic, aerodynamics, to, study, plasma, interaction, with, magnetic, fields, to, eventually, achieve, passive, and, even, active, flow, control, around, vehicles, or, projectiles, in, order, to, soften, and, mitigate, shock, waves, lower, thermal, transfer, and, reduce, drag, such, ionized, gases, used, in, plasma, technology, technological, or, engineered, plasmas, are, usually, weakly, ionized, gases, in, the, sense, that, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, gas, molecules, are, ionized, these, kinds, of, weakly, ionized, gases, are, also, nonthermal, cold, plasmas, in, the, presence, of, magnetics, fields, the, study, of, such, magnetized, nonthermal, weakly, ionized, gases, involves, resistive, magnetohydrodynamics, with, low, magnetic, reynolds, number, a, challenging, field, of, plasma, physics, where, calculations, require, dyadic, tensors, in, a, 7, dimensional, phase, space, when, used, in, combination, with, a, high, hall, parameter, a, critical, value, triggers, the, problematic, electrothermal, instability, which, limited, these, technological, developments, although, the, underlying, equations, governing, plasmas, are, relatively, simple, plasma, behaviour, is, extraordinarily, varied, and, subtle, the, emergence, of, unexpected, behaviour, from, a, simple, model, is, a, typical, feature, of, a, complex, system, such, systems, lie, in, some, sense, on, the, boundary, between, ordered, and, disordered, behaviour, and, cannot, typically, be, described, either, by, simple, smooth, mathematical, functions, or, by, pure, randomness, the, spontaneous, formation, of, interesting, spatial, features, on, a, wide, range, of, length, scales, is, one, manifestation, of, plasma, complexity, the, features, are, interesting, for, example, because, they, are, very, sharp, spatially, intermittent, the, distance, between, features, is, much, larger, than, the, features, themselves, or, have, a, fractal, form, many, of, these, features, were, first, studied, in, the, laboratory, and, have, subsequently, been, recognized, throughout, the, universe, examples, of, complexity, and, complex, structures, in, plasmas, include, striations, or, string, like, structures, are, seen, in, many, plasmas, like, the, plasma, ball, the, aurora, lightning, electric, arcs, solar, flares, and, supernova, remnants, they, are, sometimes, associated, with, larger, current, densities, and, the, interaction, with, the, magnetic, field, can, form, a, magnetic, rope, structure, see, also, plasma, pinch, filamentation, also, refers, to, the, self, focusing, of, a, high, power, laser, pulse, at, high, powers, the, nonlinear, part, of, the, index, of, refraction, becomes, important, and, causes, a, higher, index, of, refraction, in, the, center, of, the, laser, beam, where, the, laser, is, brighter, than, at, the, edges, causing, a, feedback, that, focuses, the, laser, even, more, the, tighter, focused, laser, has, a, higher, peak, brightness, irradiance, that, forms, a, plasma, the, plasma, has, an, index, of, refraction, lower, than, one, and, causes, a, defocusing, of, the, laser, beam, the, interplay, of, the, focusing, index, of, refraction, and, the, defocusing, plasma, makes, the, formation, of, a, long, filament, of, plasma, that, can, be, micrometers, to, kilometers, in, length, one, interesting, aspect, of, the, filamentation, generated, plasma, is, the, relatively, low, ion, density, due, to, defocusing, effects, of, the, ionized, electrons, see, also, filament, propagation, impermeable, plasma, is, a, type, of, thermal, plasma, which, acts, like, an, impermeable, solid, with, respect, to, gas, or, cold, plasma, and, can, be, physically, pushed, interaction, of, cold, gas, and, thermal, plasma, was, briefly, studied, by, a, group, led, by, hannes, alfv, n, in, 1960s, and, 1970s, for, its, possible, applications, in, insulation, of, fusion, plasma, from, the, reactor, walls, however, later, it, was, found, that, the, external, magnetic, fields, in, this, configuration, could, induce, kink, instabilities, in, the, plasma, and, subsequently, lead, to, an, unexpectedly, high, heat, loss, to, the, walls, in, 2013, a, group, of, materials, scientists, reported, that, they, have, successfully, generated, stable, impermeable, plasma, with, no, magnetic, confinement, using, only, an, ultrahigh, pressure, blanket, of, cold, gas, while, spectroscopic, data, on, the, characteristics, of, plasma, were, claimed, to, be, difficult, to, obtain, due, to, the, high, pressure, the, passive, effect, of, plasma, on, synthesis, of, different, nanostructures, clearly, suggested, the, effective, confinement, they, also, showed, that, upon, maintaining, the, impermeability, for, a, few, tens, of, seconds, screening, of, ions, at, the, plasma, gas, interface, could, give, rise, to, a, strong, secondary, mode, of, heating, known, as, viscous, heating, leading, to, different, kinetics, of, reactions, and, formation, of, complex, nanomaterials
