in, physics, a, gauge, theory, is, a, type, of, field, theory, in, which, the, lagrangian, and, hence, the, dynamics, of, the, system, itself, do, not, change, under, local, transformations, according, to, certain, smooth, families, of, operations, lie, groups, formally, the, lagrangian, is, invariant, under, these, transformations, the, term, gauge, refers, to, any, specific, mathematical, formalism, to, regulate, redundant, degrees, of, freedom, in, the, lagrangian, of, a, physical, system, the, transformations, between, possible, gauges, called, gauge, transformations, form, a, lie, group, referred, to, as, the, symmetry, group, or, the, gauge, group, of, the, theory, associated, with, any, lie, group, is, the, lie, algebra, of, group, generators, for, each, group, generator, there, necessarily, arises, a, corresponding, field, usually, a, vector, field, called, the, gauge, field, gauge, fields, are, included, in, the, lagrangian, to, ensure, its, invariance, under, the, local, group, transformations, called, gauge, invariance, when, such, a, theory, is, quantized, the, quanta, of, the, gauge, fields, are, called, gauge, bosons, if, the, symmetry, group, is, non, commutative, then, the, gauge, theory, is, referred, to, as, non, abelian, gauge, theory, the, usual, example, being, the, yang, mills, theory, many, powerful, theories, in, physics, are, described, by, lagrangians, that, are, invariant, under, some, symmetry, transformation, groups, when, they, are, invariant, under, a, transformation, identically, performed, at, every, point, in, the, spacetime, in, which, the, physical, processes, occur, they, are, said, to, have, a, global, symmetry, local, symmetry, the, cornerstone, of, gauge, theories, is, a, stronger, constraint, in, fact, a, global, symmetry, is, just, a, local, symmetry, whose, group, s, parameters, are, fixed, in, spacetime, the, same, way, a, constant, value, can, be, understood, as, a, function, of, a, certain, parameter, the, output, of, which, is, always, the, same, gauge, theories, are, important, as, the, successful, field, theories, explaining, the, dynamics, of, elementary, particles, quantum, electrodynamics, is, an, abelian, gauge, theory, with, the, symmetry, group, u, 1, and, has, one, gauge, field, the, electromagnetic, four, potential, with, the, photon, being, the, gauge, boson, the, standard, model, is, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, with, the, symmetry, group, u, 1, su, 2, su, 3, and, has, a, total, of, twelve, gauge, bosons, the, photon, three, weak, bosons, and, eight, gluons, gauge, theories, are, also, important, in, explaining, gravitation, in, the, theory, of, general, relativity, its, case, is, somewhat, unusual, in, that, the, gauge, field, is, a, tensor, the, lanczos, tensor, theories, of, quantum, gravity, beginning, with, gauge, gravitation, theory, also, postulate, the, existence, of, a, gauge, boson, known, as, the, graviton, gauge, symmetries, can, be, viewed, as, analogues, of, the, principle, of, general, covariance, of, general, relativity, in, which, the, coordinate, system, can, be, chosen, freely, under, arbitrary, diffeomorphisms, of, spacetime, both, gauge, invariance, and, diffeomorphism, invariance, reflect, a, redundancy, in, the, description, of, the, system, an, alternative, theory, of, gravitation, gauge, theory, gravity, replaces, the, principle, of, general, covariance, with, a, true, gauge, principle, with, new, gauge, fields, historically, these, ideas, were, first, stated, in, the, context, of, classical, electromagnetism, and, later, in, general, relativity, however, the, modern, importance, of, gauge, symmetries, appeared, first, in, the, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, of, electrons, quantum, electrodynamics, elaborated, on, below, today, gauge, theories, are, useful, in, condensed, matter, nuclear, and, high, energy, physics, among, other, subfields, the, concept, and, the, name, of, gauge, theory, derives, from, the, work, of, hermann, weyl, in, 1918, weyl, in, an, attempt, to, generalize, the, geometrical, ideas, of, general, relativity, to, include, electromagnetism, conjectured, that, eichinvarianz, or, invariance, under, the, change, of, scale, or, gauge, might, also, be, a, local, symmetry, of, general, relativity, after, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, weyl, vladimir, fock, and, fritz, london, replaced, the, simple, scale, factor, with, a, complex, quantity, and, turned, the, scale, transformation, into, a, change, of, phase, which, is, a, u, 1, gauge, symmetry, this, explained, the, electromagnetic, field, effect, on, the, wave, function, of, a, charged, quantum, mechanical, particle, weyl, s, 1929, paper, introduced, the, modern, concept, of, gauge, invariance, subsequently, popularized, by, pauli, in, his, 1941, review, in, retrospect, maxwell, s, formulation, in, 1864, 65, of, electrodynamics, a, dynamical, theory, of, the, electromagnetic, field, suggested, the, possibility, of, invariance, when, he, stated, that, any, vector, field, whose, curl, vanishes, and, can, therefore, normally, be, written, as, a, gradient, of, a, function, could, be, added, to, the, vector, potential, without, affecting, the, magnetic, field, similarly, unnoticed, hilbert, had, derived, the, einstein, field, equations, by, postulating, the, invariance, of, the, action, under, a, general, coordinate, transformation, the, importance, of, these, symmetry, invariances, remained, unnoticed, until, weyl, s, work, inspired, by, pauli, s, descriptions, of, connection, between, charge, conservation, and, field, theory, driven, by, invariance, chen, ning, yang, sought, a, field, theory, for, atomic, nuclei, binding, based, on, conservation, of, nuclear, isospin, 202, in, 1954, yang, and, robert, mills, generalized, the, gauge, invariance, of, electromagnetism, constructing, a, theory, based, on, the, action, of, the, non, abelian, su, 2, symmetry, group, on, the, isospin, doublet, of, protons, and, neutrons, this, is, similar, to, the, action, of, the, u, 1, group, on, the, spinor, fields, of, quantum, electrodynamics, the, yang, mills, theory, became, the, prototype, theory, to, resolve, some, of, the, great, confusion, in, elementary, particle, physics, this, idea, later, found, application, in, the, quantum, field, theory, of, the, weak, force, and, its, unification, with, electromagnetism, in, the, electroweak, theory, gauge, theories, became, even, more, attractive, when, it, was, realized, that, non, abelian, gauge, theories, reproduced, a, feature, called, asymptotic, freedom, asymptotic, freedom, was, believed, to, be, an, important, characteristic, of, strong, interactions, this, motivated, searching, for, a, strong, force, gauge, theory, this, theory, now, known, as, quantum, chromodynamics, is, a, gauge, theory, with, the, action, of, the, su, 3, group, on, the, color, triplet, of, quarks, the, standard, model, unifies, the, description, of, electromagnetism, weak, interactions, and, strong, interactions, in, the, language, of, gauge, theory, in, the, 1970s, michael, atiyah, began, studying, the, mathematics, of, solutions, to, the, classical, yang, mills, equations, in, 1983, atiyah, s, student, simon, donaldson, built, on, this, work, to, show, that, the, differentiable, classification, of, smooth, 4, manifolds, is, very, different, from, their, classification, up, to, homeomorphism, michael, freedman, used, donaldson, s, work, to, exhibit, exotic, r, 4, s, that, is, exotic, differentiable, structures, on, euclidean, 4, dimensional, space, this, led, to, an, increasing, interest, in, gauge, theory, for, its, own, sake, independent, of, its, successes, in, fundamental, physics, in, 1994, edward, witten, and, nathan, seiberg, invented, gauge, theoretic, techniques, based, on, supersymmetry, that, enabled, the, calculation, of, certain, topological, invariants, the, seiberg, witten, invariants, these, contributions, to, mathematics, from, gauge, theory, have, led, to, a, renewed, interest, in, this, area, the, importance, of, gauge, theories, in, physics, is, exemplified, in, the, tremendous, success, of, the, mathematical, formalism, in, providing, a, unified, framework, to, describe, the, quantum, field, theories, of, electromagnetism, the, weak, force, and, the, strong, force, this, theory, known, as, the, standard, model, accurately, describes, experimental, predictions, regarding, three, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, and, is, a, gauge, theory, with, the, gauge, group, su, 3, su, 2, u, 1, modern, theories, like, string, theory, as, well, as, general, relativity, are, in, one, way, or, another, gauge, theories, in, physics, the, mathematical, description, of, any, physical, situation, usually, contains, excess, degrees, of, freedom, the, same, physical, situation, is, equally, well, described, by, many, equivalent, mathematical, configurations, for, instance, in, newtonian, dynamics, if, two, configurations, are, related, by, a, galilean, transformation, an, inertial, change, of, reference, frame, they, represent, the, same, physical, situation, these, transformations, form, a, group, of, symmetries, of, the, theory, and, a, physical, situation, corresponds, not, to, an, individual, mathematical, configuration, but, to, a, class, of, configurations, related, to, one, another, by, this, symmetry, group, this, idea, can, be, generalized, to, include, local, as, well, as, global, symmetries, analogous, to, much, more, abstract, changes, of, coordinates, in, a, situation, where, there, is, no, preferred, inertial, coordinate, system, that, covers, the, entire, physical, system, a, gauge, theory, is, a, mathematical, model, that, has, symmetries, of, this, kind, together, with, a, set, of, techniques, for, making, physical, predictions, consistent, with, the, symmetries, of, the, model, when, a, quantity, occurring, in, the, mathematical, configuration, is, not, just, a, number, but, has, some, geometrical, significance, such, as, a, velocity, or, an, axis, of, rotation, its, representation, as, numbers, arranged, in, a, vector, or, matrix, is, also, changed, by, a, coordinate, transformation, for, instance, if, one, description, of, a, pattern, of, fluid, flow, states, that, the, fluid, velocity, in, the, neighborhood, of, x, 1, y, 0, is, 1, m, s, in, the, positive, x, direction, then, a, description, of, the, same, situation, in, which, the, coordinate, system, has, been, rotated, clockwise, by, 90, degrees, states, that, the, fluid, velocity, in, the, neighborhood, of, x, 0, y, 1, is, 1, m, s, in, the, negative, y, direction, the, coordinate, transformation, has, affected, both, the, coordinate, system, used, to, identify, the, location, of, the, measurement, and, the, basis, in, which, its, value, is, expressed, as, long, as, this, transformation, is, performed, globally, affecting, the, coordinate, basis, in, the, same, way, at, every, point, the, effect, on, values, that, represent, the, rate, of, change, of, some, quantity, along, some, path, in, space, and, time, as, it, passes, through, point, p, is, the, same, as, the, effect, on, values, that, are, truly, local, to, p, in, order, to, adequately, describe, physical, situations, in, more, complex, theories, it, is, often, necessary, to, introduce, a, coordinate, basis, for, some, of, the, objects, of, the, theory, that, do, not, have, this, simple, relationship, to, the, coordinates, used, to, label, points, in, space, and, time, in, mathematical, terms, the, theory, involves, a, fiber, bundle, in, which, the, fiber, at, each, point, of, the, base, space, consists, of, possible, coordinate, bases, for, use, when, describing, the, values, of, objects, at, that, point, in, order, to, spell, out, a, mathematical, configuration, one, must, choose, a, particular, coordinate, basis, at, each, point, a, local, section, of, the, fiber, bundle, and, express, the, values, of, the, objects, of, the, theory, usually, fields, in, the, physicist, s, sense, using, this, basis, two, such, mathematical, configurations, are, equivalent, describe, the, same, physical, situation, if, they, are, related, by, a, transformation, of, this, abstract, coordinate, basis, a, change, of, local, section, or, gauge, transformation, in, most, gauge, theories, the, set, of, possible, transformations, of, the, abstract, gauge, basis, at, an, individual, point, in, space, and, time, is, a, finite, dimensional, lie, group, the, simplest, such, group, is, u, 1, which, appears, in, the, modern, formulation, of, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, via, its, use, of, complex, numbers, qed, is, generally, regarded, as, the, first, and, simplest, physical, gauge, theory, the, set, of, possible, gauge, transformations, of, the, entire, configuration, of, a, given, gauge, theory, also, forms, a, group, the, gauge, group, of, the, theory, an, element, of, the, gauge, group, can, be, parameterized, by, a, smoothly, varying, function, from, the, points, of, spacetime, to, the, finite, dimensional, lie, group, such, that, the, value, of, the, function, and, its, derivatives, at, each, point, represents, the, action, of, the, gauge, transformation, on, the, fiber, over, that, point, a, gauge, transformation, with, constant, parameter, at, every, point, in, space, and, time, is, analogous, to, a, rigid, rotation, of, the, geometric, coordinate, system, it, represents, a, global, symmetry, of, the, gauge, representation, as, in, the, case, of, a, rigid, rotation, this, gauge, transformation, affects, expressions, that, represent, the, rate, of, change, along, a, path, of, some, gauge, dependent, quantity, in, the, same, way, as, those, that, represent, a, truly, local, quantity, a, gauge, transformation, whose, parameter, is, not, a, constant, function, is, referred, to, as, a, local, symmetry, its, effect, on, expressions, that, involve, a, derivative, is, qualitatively, different, from, that, on, expressions, that, do, not, this, is, analogous, to, a, non, inertial, change, of, reference, frame, which, can, produce, a, coriolis, effect, the, gauge, covariant, version, of, a, gauge, theory, accounts, for, this, effect, by, introducing, a, gauge, field, in, mathematical, language, an, ehresmann, connection, and, formulating, all, rates, of, change, in, terms, of, the, covariant, derivative, with, respect, to, this, connection, the, gauge, field, becomes, an, essential, part, of, the, description, of, a, mathematical, configuration, a, configuration, in, which, the, gauge, field, can, be, eliminated, by, a, gauge, transformation, has, the, property, that, its, field, strength, in, mathematical, language, its, curvature, is, zero, everywhere, a, gauge, theory, is, not, limited, to, these, configurations, in, other, words, the, distinguishing, characteristic, of, a, gauge, theory, is, that, the, gauge, field, does, not, merely, compensate, for, a, poor, choice, of, coordinate, system, there, is, generally, no, gauge, transformation, that, makes, the, gauge, field, vanish, when, analyzing, the, dynamics, of, a, gauge, theory, the, gauge, field, must, be, treated, as, a, dynamical, variable, similar, to, other, objects, in, the, description, of, a, physical, situation, in, addition, to, its, interaction, with, other, objects, via, the, covariant, derivative, the, gauge, field, typically, contributes, energy, in, the, form, of, a, self, energy, term, one, can, obtain, the, equations, for, the, gauge, theory, by, this, is, the, sense, in, which, a, gauge, theory, extends, a, global, symmetry, to, a, local, symmetry, and, closely, resembles, the, historical, development, of, the, gauge, theory, of, gravity, known, as, general, relativity, gauge, theories, used, to, model, the, results, of, physical, experiments, engage, in, we, cannot, express, the, mathematical, descriptions, of, the, setup, information, and, the, possible, measurement, outcomes, or, the, boundary, conditions, of, the, experiment, without, reference, to, a, particular, coordinate, system, including, a, choice, of, gauge, one, assumes, an, adequate, experiment, isolated, from, external, influence, that, is, itself, a, gauge, dependent, statement, mishandling, gauge, dependence, calculations, in, boundary, conditions, is, a, frequent, source, of, anomalies, and, approaches, to, anomaly, avoidance, classifies, gauge, theories, the, two, gauge, theories, mentioned, above, continuum, electrodynamics, and, general, relativity, are, continuum, field, theories, the, techniques, of, calculation, in, a, continuum, theory, implicitly, assume, that, determination, of, the, likelihood, of, possible, measurement, outcomes, proceed, by, these, assumptions, have, enough, validity, across, a, wide, range, of, energy, scales, and, experimental, conditions, to, allow, these, theories, to, make, accurate, predictions, about, almost, all, of, the, phenomena, encountered, in, daily, life, light, heat, and, electricity, eclipses, spaceflight, etc, they, fail, only, at, the, smallest, and, largest, scales, due, to, omissions, in, the, theories, themselves, and, when, the, mathematical, techniques, themselves, break, down, most, notably, in, the, case, of, turbulence, and, other, chaotic, phenomena, other, than, these, classical, continuum, field, theories, the, most, widely, known, gauge, theories, are, quantum, field, theories, including, quantum, electrodynamics, and, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particle, physics, the, starting, point, of, a, quantum, field, theory, is, much, like, that, of, its, continuum, analog, a, gauge, covariant, action, integral, that, characterizes, allowable, physical, situations, according, to, the, principle, of, least, action, however, continuum, and, quantum, theories, differ, significantly, in, how, they, handle, the, excess, degrees, of, freedom, represented, by, gauge, transformations, continuum, theories, and, most, pedagogical, treatments, of, the, simplest, quantum, field, theories, use, a, gauge, fixing, prescription, to, reduce, the, orbit, of, mathematical, configurations, that, represent, a, given, physical, situation, to, a, smaller, orbit, related, by, a, smaller, gauge, group, the, global, symmetry, group, or, perhaps, even, the, trivial, group, more, sophisticated, quantum, field, theories, in, particular, those, that, involve, a, non, abelian, gauge, group, break, the, gauge, symmetry, within, the, techniques, of, perturbation, theory, by, introducing, additional, fields, the, faddeev, popov, ghosts, and, counterterms, motivated, by, anomaly, cancellation, in, an, approach, known, as, brst, quantization, while, these, concerns, are, in, one, sense, highly, technical, they, are, also, closely, related, to, the, nature, of, measurement, the, limits, on, knowledge, of, a, physical, situation, and, the, interactions, between, incompletely, specified, experimental, conditions, and, incompletely, understood, physical, theory, the, mathematical, techniques, that, have, been, developed, in, order, to, make, gauge, theories, tractable, have, found, many, other, applications, from, solid, state, physics, and, crystallography, to, low, dimensional, topology, in, electrostatics, one, can, either, discuss, the, electric, field, e, or, its, corresponding, electric, potential, v, knowledge, of, one, makes, it, possible, to, find, the, other, except, that, potentials, differing, by, a, constant, v, v, c, displaystyle, v, mapsto, v, c, correspond, to, the, same, electric, field, this, is, because, the, electric, field, relates, to, changes, in, the, potential, from, one, point, in, space, to, another, and, the, constant, c, would, cancel, out, when, subtracting, to, find, the, change, in, potential, in, terms, of, vector, calculus, the, electric, field, is, the, gradient, of, the, potential, e, v, displaystyle, mathbf, e, nabla, v, generalizing, from, static, electricity, to, electromagnetism, we, have, a, second, potential, the, vector, potential, a, with, the, general, gauge, transformations, now, become, not, just, v, v, c, displaystyle, v, mapsto, v, c, but, where, f, is, any, twice, continuously, differentiable, function, that, depends, on, position, and, time, the, electromagnetic, fields, remain, the, same, under, the, gauge, transformation, the, following, illustrates, how, local, gauge, invariance, can, be, motivated, heuristically, starting, from, global, symmetry, properties, and, how, it, leads, to, an, interaction, between, originally, non, interacting, fields, consider, a, set, of, n, displaystyle, n, non, interacting, real, scalar, fields, with, equal, masses, m, this, system, is, described, by, an, action, that, is, the, sum, of, the, usual, action, for, each, scalar, field, i, displaystyle, varphi, i, the, lagrangian, density, can, be, compactly, written, as, by, introducing, a, vector, of, fields, the, term, displaystyle, partial, mu, phi, is, the, partial, derivative, of, displaystyle, phi, along, dimension, displaystyle, mu, it, is, now, transparent, that, the, lagrangian, is, invariant, under, the, transformation, whenever, g, is, a, constant, matrix, belonging, to, the, n, by, n, orthogonal, group, o, n, this, is, seen, to, preserve, the, lagrangian, since, the, derivative, of, displaystyle, phi, transforms, identically, to, displaystyle, phi, and, both, quantities, appear, inside, dot, products, in, the, lagrangian, orthogonal, transformations, preserve, the, dot, product, this, characterizes, the, global, symmetry, of, this, particular, lagrangian, and, the, symmetry, group, is, often, called, the, gauge, group, the, mathematical, term, is, structure, group, especially, in, the, theory, of, g, structures, incidentally, noether, s, theorem, implies, that, invariance, under, this, group, of, transformations, leads, to, the, conservation, of, the, currents, where, the, t, a, matrices, are, generators, of, the, so, n, group, there, is, one, conserved, current, for, every, generator, now, demanding, that, this, lagrangian, should, have, local, o, n, invariance, requires, that, the, g, matrices, which, were, earlier, constant, should, be, allowed, to, become, functions, of, the, spacetime, coordinates, x, in, this, case, the, g, matrices, do, not, pass, through, the, derivatives, when, g, g, x, the, failure, of, the, derivative, to, commute, with, g, introduces, an, additional, term, in, keeping, with, the, product, rule, which, spoils, the, invariance, of, the, lagrangian, in, order, to, rectify, this, we, define, a, new, derivative, operator, such, that, the, derivative, of, displaystyle, phi, again, transforms, identically, with, displaystyle, phi, this, new, derivative, is, called, a, gauge, covariant, derivative, and, takes, the, form, where, g, is, called, the, coupling, constant, a, quantity, defining, the, strength, of, an, interaction, after, a, simple, calculation, we, can, see, that, the, gauge, field, a, x, must, transform, as, follows, the, gauge, field, is, an, element, of, the, lie, algebra, and, can, therefore, be, expanded, as, there, are, therefore, as, many, gauge, fields, as, there, are, generators, of, the, lie, algebra, finally, we, now, have, a, locally, gauge, invariant, lagrangian, pauli, uses, the, term, gauge, transformation, of, the, first, type, to, mean, the, transformation, of, displaystyle, phi, while, the, compensating, transformation, in, a, displaystyle, a, is, called, a, gauge, transformation, of, the, second, type, the, difference, between, this, lagrangian, and, the, original, globally, gauge, invariant, lagrangian, is, seen, to, be, the, interaction, lagrangian, this, term, introduces, interactions, between, the, n, scalar, fields, just, as, a, consequence, of, the, demand, for, local, gauge, invariance, however, to, make, this, interaction, physical, and, not, completely, arbitrary, the, mediator, a, x, needs, to, propagate, in, space, that, is, dealt, with, in, the, next, section, by, adding, yet, another, term, l, g, f, displaystyle, mathcal, l, mathrm, gf, to, the, lagrangian, in, the, quantized, version, of, the, obtained, classical, field, theory, the, quanta, of, the, gauge, field, a, x, are, called, gauge, bosons, the, interpretation, of, the, interaction, lagrangian, in, quantum, field, theory, is, of, scalar, bosons, interacting, by, the, exchange, of, these, gauge, bosons, the, picture, of, a, classical, gauge, theory, developed, in, the, previous, section, is, almost, complete, except, for, the, fact, that, to, define, the, covariant, derivatives, d, one, needs, to, know, the, value, of, the, gauge, field, a, x, displaystyle, a, x, at, all, spacetime, points, instead, of, manually, specifying, the, values, of, this, field, it, can, be, given, as, the, solution, to, a, field, equation, further, requiring, that, the, lagrangian, that, generates, this, field, equation, is, locally, gauge, invariant, as, well, one, possible, form, for, the, gauge, field, lagrangian, is, where, the, f, a, displaystyle, f, mu, nu, a, are, obtained, from, potentials, a, a, displaystyle, a, mu, a, being, the, components, of, a, x, displaystyle, a, x, by, and, the, f, a, b, c, displaystyle, f, abc, are, the, structure, constants, of, the, lie, algebra, of, the, generators, of, the, gauge, group, this, formulation, of, the, lagrangian, is, called, a, yang, mills, action, other, gauge, invariant, actions, also, exist, e, g, nonlinear, electrodynamics, born, infeld, action, chern, simons, model, theta, term, etc, in, this, lagrangian, term, there, is, no, field, whose, transformation, counterweighs, the, one, of, a, displaystyle, a, invariance, of, this, term, under, gauge, transformations, is, a, particular, case, of, a, priori, classical, geometrical, symmetry, this, symmetry, must, be, restricted, in, order, to, perform, quantization, the, procedure, being, denominated, gauge, fixing, but, even, after, restriction, gauge, transformations, may, be, possible, the, complete, lagrangian, for, the, gauge, theory, is, now, as, a, simple, application, of, the, formalism, developed, in, the, previous, sections, consider, the, case, of, electrodynamics, with, only, the, electron, field, the, bare, bones, action, that, generates, the, electron, field, s, dirac, equation, is, the, global, symmetry, for, this, system, is, the, gauge, group, here, is, u, 1, just, rotations, of, the, phase, angle, of, the, field, with, the, particular, rotation, determined, by, the, constant, localising, this, symmetry, implies, the, replacement, of, by, x, an, appropriate, covariant, derivative, is, then, identifying, the, charge, e, not, to, be, confused, with, the, mathematical, constant, e, in, the, symmetry, description, with, the, usual, electric, charge, this, is, the, origin, of, the, usage, of, the, term, in, gauge, theories, and, the, gauge, field, a, x, with, the, four, vector, potential, of, the, electromagnetic, field, results, in, an, interaction, lagrangian, where, j, x, e, x, x, displaystyle, j, mu, x, frac, e, hbar, bar, psi, x, gamma, mu, psi, x, is, the, electric, current, four, vector, in, the, dirac, field, the, gauge, principle, is, therefore, seen, to, naturally, introduce, the, so, called, minimal, coupling, of, the, electromagnetic, field, to, the, electron, field, adding, a, lagrangian, for, the, gauge, field, a, x, displaystyle, a, mu, x, in, terms, of, the, field, strength, tensor, exactly, as, in, electrodynamics, one, obtains, the, lagrangian, used, as, the, starting, point, in, quantum, electrodynamics, gauge, theories, are, usually, discussed, in, the, language, of, differential, geometry, mathematically, a, gauge, is, just, a, choice, of, a, local, section, of, some, principal, bundle, a, gauge, transformation, is, just, a, transformation, between, two, such, sections, although, gauge, theory, is, dominated, by, the, study, of, connections, primarily, because, it, s, mainly, studied, by, high, energy, physicists, the, idea, of, a, connection, is, not, central, to, gauge, theory, in, general, in, fact, a, result, in, general, gauge, theory, shows, that, affine, representations, i, e, affine, modules, of, the, gauge, transformations, can, be, classified, as, sections, of, a, jet, bundle, satisfying, certain, properties, there, are, representations, that, transform, covariantly, pointwise, called, by, physicists, gauge, transformations, of, the, first, kind, representations, that, transform, as, a, connection, form, called, by, physicists, gauge, transformations, of, the, second, kind, an, affine, representation, and, other, more, general, representations, such, as, the, b, field, in, bf, theory, there, are, more, general, nonlinear, representations, realizations, but, these, are, extremely, complicated, still, nonlinear, sigma, models, transform, nonlinearly, so, there, are, applications, if, there, is, a, principal, bundle, p, whose, base, space, is, space, or, spacetime, and, structure, group, is, a, lie, group, then, the, sections, of, p, form, a, principal, homogeneous, space, of, the, group, of, gauge, transformations, connections, gauge, connection, define, this, principal, bundle, yielding, a, covariant, derivative, in, each, associated, vector, bundle, if, a, local, frame, is, chosen, a, local, basis, of, sections, then, this, covariant, derivative, is, represented, by, the, connection, form, a, a, lie, algebra, valued, 1, form, which, is, called, the, gauge, potential, in, physics, this, is, evidently, not, an, intrinsic, but, a, frame, dependent, quantity, the, curvature, form, f, a, lie, algebra, valued, 2, form, that, is, an, intrinsic, quantity, is, constructed, from, a, connection, form, by, where, d, stands, for, the, exterior, derivative, and, displaystyle, wedge, stands, for, the, wedge, product, a, displaystyle, mathbf, a, is, an, element, of, the, vector, space, spanned, by, the, generators, t, a, displaystyle, t, a, and, so, the, components, of, a, displaystyle, mathbf, a, do, not, commute, with, one, another, hence, the, wedge, product, a, a, displaystyle, mathbf, a, wedge, mathbf, a, does, not, vanish, infinitesimal, gauge, transformations, form, a, lie, algebra, which, is, characterized, by, a, smooth, lie, algebra, valued, scalar, under, such, an, infinitesimal, gauge, transformation, where, displaystyle, is, the, lie, bracket, one, nice, thing, is, that, if, x, x, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, x, varepsilon, x, then, d, x, d, x, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, dx, varepsilon, dx, where, d, is, the, covariant, derivative, also, f, f, displaystyle, delta, varepsilon, mathbf, f, which, means, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, transforms, covariantly, not, all, gauge, transformations, can, be, generated, by, infinitesimal, gauge, transformations, in, general, an, example, is, when, the, base, manifold, is, a, compact, manifold, without, boundary, such, that, the, homotopy, class, of, mappings, from, that, manifold, to, the, lie, group, is, nontrivial, see, instanton, for, an, example, the, yang, mills, action, is, now, given, by, where, stands, for, the, hodge, dual, and, the, integral, is, defined, as, in, differential, geometry, a, quantity, which, is, gauge, invariant, i, e, invariant, under, gauge, transformations, is, the, wilson, loop, which, is, defined, over, any, closed, path, as, follows, where, is, the, character, of, a, complex, representation, and, p, displaystyle, mathcal, p, represents, the, path, ordered, operator, the, formalism, of, gauge, theory, carries, over, to, a, general, setting, for, example, it, is, sufficient, to, ask, that, a, vector, bundle, have, a, metric, connection, when, one, does, so, one, finds, that, the, metric, connection, satisfies, the, yang, mills, equations, of, motion, gauge, theories, may, be, quantized, by, specialization, of, methods, which, are, applicable, to, any, quantum, field, theory, however, because, of, the, subtleties, imposed, by, the, gauge, constraints, see, section, on, mathematical, formalism, above, there, are, many, technical, problems, to, be, solved, which, do, not, arise, in, other, field, theories, at, the, same, time, the, richer, structure, of, gauge, theories, allows, simplification, of, some, computations, for, example, ward, identities, connect, different, renormalization, constants, the, first, gauge, theory, quantized, was, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, the, first, methods, developed, for, this, involved, gauge, fixing, and, then, applying, canonical, quantization, the, gupta, bleuler, method, was, also, developed, to, handle, this, problem, non, abelian, gauge, theories, are, now, handled, by, a, variety, of, means, methods, for, quantization, are, covered, in, the, article, on, quantization, the, main, point, to, quantization, is, to, be, able, to, compute, quantum, amplitudes, for, various, processes, allowed, by, the, theory, technically, they, reduce, to, the, computations, of, certain, correlation, functions, in, the, vacuum, state, this, involves, a, renormalization, of, the, theory, when, the, running, coupling, of, the, theory, is, small, enough, then, all, required, quantities, may, be, computed, in, perturbation, theory, quantization, schemes, intended, to, simplify, such, computations, such, as, canonical, quantization, may, be, called, perturbative, quantization, schemes, at, present, some, of, these, methods, lead, to, the, most, precise, experimental, tests, of, gauge, theories, however, in, most, gauge, theories, there, are, many, interesting, questions, which, are, non, perturbative, quantization, schemes, suited, to, these, problems, such, as, lattice, gauge, theory, may, be, called, non, perturbative, quantization, schemes, precise, computations, in, such, schemes, often, require, supercomputing, and, are, therefore, less, well, developed, currently, than, other, schemes, some, of, the, symmetries, of, the, classical, theory, are, then, seen, not, to, hold, in, the, quantum, theory, a, phenomenon, called, an, anomaly, among, the, most, well, known, are, a, pure, gauge, is, the, set, of, field, configurations, obtained, by, a, gauge, transformation, on, the, null, field, configuration, i, e, a, gauge, transform, of, zero, so, it, is, a, particular, gauge, orbit, in, the, field, configuration, s, space, thus, in, the, abelian, case, where, a, x, a, x, a, x, f, x, displaystyle, a, mu, x, rightarrow, a, mu, x, a, mu, x, partial, mu, f, x, the, pure, gauge, is, just, the, set, of, field, configurations, a, x, f, x, displaystyle, a, mu, x, partial, mu, f, x, for, all, f, x
