io, a, o, or, jupiter, i, is, the, innermost, and, second, smallest, of, the, four, galilean, moons, of, the, planet, jupiter, slightly, larger, than, earth, s, moon, io, is, the, fourth, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, has, the, highest, density, of, any, moon, the, strongest, surface, gravity, of, any, moon, and, the, lowest, amount, of, water, by, atomic, ratio, of, any, known, astronomical, object, in, the, solar, system, it, was, discovered, in, 1610, by, galileo, galilei, and, was, named, after, the, mythological, character, io, a, priestess, of, hera, who, became, one, of, zeus, s, lovers, with, over, 400, active, volcanoes, io, is, the, most, geologically, active, object, in, the, solar, system, this, extreme, geologic, activity, is, the, result, of, tidal, heating, from, friction, generated, within, io, s, interior, as, it, is, pulled, between, jupiter, and, the, other, galilean, moons, europa, ganymede, and, callisto, several, volcanoes, produce, plumes, of, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, that, climb, as, high, as, 500, km, 300, mi, above, the, surface, io, s, surface, is, also, dotted, with, more, than, 100, mountains, that, have, been, uplifted, by, extensive, compression, at, the, base, of, io, s, silicate, crust, some, of, these, peaks, are, taller, than, mount, everest, the, highest, point, on, earth, s, surface, unlike, most, moons, in, the, outer, solar, system, which, are, mostly, composed, of, water, ice, io, is, primarily, composed, of, silicate, rock, surrounding, a, molten, iron, or, iron, sulfide, core, most, of, io, s, surface, is, composed, of, extensive, plains, with, a, frosty, coating, of, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, io, s, volcanism, is, responsible, for, many, of, its, unique, features, its, volcanic, plumes, and, lava, flows, produce, large, surface, changes, and, paint, the, surface, in, various, subtle, shades, of, yellow, red, white, black, and, green, largely, due, to, allotropes, and, compounds, of, sulfur, numerous, extensive, lava, flows, several, more, than, 500, km, 300, mi, in, length, also, mark, the, surface, the, materials, produced, by, this, volcanism, make, up, io, s, thin, patchy, atmosphere, and, they, also, greatly, affect, the, nature, and, radiation, levels, of, jupiter, s, extensive, magnetosphere, io, s, volcanic, ejecta, also, produce, a, large, intense, plasma, torus, around, jupiter, creating, a, hostile, radiation, environment, on, and, around, the, moon, io, receives, about, 3, 600, rem, 36, sv, of, ionizing, radiation, per, day, io, played, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, astronomy, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, discovered, in, january, 1610, by, galileo, galilei, along, with, the, other, galilean, satellites, this, discovery, furthered, the, adoption, of, the, copernican, model, of, the, solar, system, the, development, of, kepler, s, laws, of, motion, and, the, first, measurement, of, the, speed, of, light, in, 1979, the, two, voyager, spacecraft, revealed, io, to, be, a, geologically, active, world, with, numerous, volcanic, features, large, mountains, and, a, young, surface, with, no, obvious, impact, craters, the, galileo, spacecraft, performed, several, close, flybys, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, obtaining, data, about, io, s, interior, structure, and, surface, composition, these, spacecraft, also, revealed, the, relationship, between, io, and, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, and, the, existence, of, a, belt, of, high, energy, radiation, centered, on, io, s, orbit, further, observations, have, been, made, by, cassini, huygens, in, 2000, new, horizons, in, 2007, and, juno, since, 2017, as, well, as, from, earth, based, telescopes, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, although, simon, marius, is, not, credited, with, the, sole, discovery, of, the, galilean, satellites, his, names, for, the, moons, were, adopted, in, his, 1614, publication, mundus, iovialis, anno, m, dc, ix, detectus, ope, perspicilli, belgici, he, proposed, several, alternative, names, for, the, innermost, of, the, large, moons, of, jupiter, including, the, mercury, of, jupiter, and, the, first, of, the, jovian, planets, based, on, a, suggestion, from, johannes, kepler, in, october, 1613, he, also, devised, a, naming, scheme, whereby, each, moon, was, named, for, a, lover, of, the, greek, god, zeus, or, his, roman, equivalent, jupiter, he, named, the, innermost, large, moon, of, jupiter, after, the, greek, io, jupiter, is, much, blamed, by, the, poets, on, account, of, his, irregular, loves, three, maidens, are, especially, mentioned, as, having, been, clandestinely, courted, by, jupiter, with, success, io, daughter, of, the, river, inachus, callisto, of, lycaon, europa, of, agenor, then, there, was, ganymede, the, handsome, son, of, king, tros, whom, jupiter, having, taken, the, form, of, an, eagle, transported, to, heaven, on, his, back, as, poets, fabulously, tell, i, think, therefore, that, i, shall, not, have, done, amiss, if, the, first, is, called, by, me, io, the, second, europa, the, third, on, account, of, its, majesty, of, light, ganymede, the, fourth, callisto, marius, s, names, were, not, widely, adopted, until, centuries, later, mid, 20th, century, in, much, of, the, earlier, astronomical, literature, io, was, generally, referred, to, by, its, roman, numeral, designation, a, system, introduced, by, galileo, as, jupiter, i, or, as, the, first, satellite, of, jupiter, the, customary, english, pronunciation, of, the, name, is, a, o, though, sometimes, people, attempt, a, more, authentic, pronunciation, i, o, the, name, has, two, competing, stems, in, latin, and, rarely, n, the, latter, is, the, basis, of, the, english, adjectival, form, ionian, features, on, io, are, named, after, characters, and, places, from, the, io, myth, as, well, as, deities, of, fire, volcanoes, the, sun, and, thunder, from, various, myths, and, characters, and, places, from, dante, s, inferno, names, appropriate, to, the, volcanic, nature, of, the, surface, since, the, surface, was, first, seen, up, close, by, voyager, 1, the, international, astronomical, union, has, approved, 249, names, for, io, s, volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and, large, albedo, features, the, approved, feature, categories, used, for, io, for, different, types, of, volcanic, features, include, patera, saucer, volcanic, depression, fluctus, flow, lava, flow, vallis, valley, lava, channel, and, active, eruptive, center, location, where, plume, activity, was, the, first, sign, of, volcanic, activity, at, a, particular, volcano, named, mountains, plateaus, layered, terrain, and, shield, volcanoes, include, the, terms, mons, mensa, table, planum, and, tholus, rotunda, respectively, named, bright, albedo, regions, use, the, term, regio, examples, of, named, features, are, prometheus, pan, mensa, tvashtar, paterae, and, ts, i, goab, fluctus, the, first, reported, observation, of, io, was, made, by, galileo, galilei, on, 7, january, 1610, using, a, 20x, power, refracting, telescope, at, the, university, of, padua, however, in, that, observation, galileo, could, not, separate, io, and, europa, due, to, the, low, power, of, his, telescope, so, the, two, were, recorded, as, a, single, point, of, light, io, and, europa, were, seen, for, the, first, time, as, separate, bodies, during, galileo, s, observations, of, the, jovian, system, the, following, day, 8, january, 1610, used, as, the, discovery, date, for, io, by, the, iau, the, discovery, of, io, and, the, other, galilean, satellites, of, jupiter, was, published, in, galileo, s, sidereus, nuncius, in, march, 1610, in, his, mundus, jovialis, published, in, 1614, simon, marius, claimed, to, have, discovered, io, and, the, other, moons, of, jupiter, in, 1609, one, week, before, galileo, s, discovery, galileo, doubted, this, claim, and, dismissed, the, work, of, marius, as, plagiarism, regardless, marius, s, first, recorded, observation, came, from, 29, december, 1609, in, the, julian, calendar, which, equates, to, 8, january, 1610, in, the, gregorian, calendar, which, galileo, used, given, that, galileo, published, his, work, before, marius, galileo, is, credited, with, the, discovery, for, the, next, two, and, a, half, centuries, io, remained, an, unresolved, 5th, magnitude, point, of, light, in, astronomers, telescopes, during, the, 17th, century, io, and, the, other, galilean, satellites, served, a, variety, of, purposes, including, early, methods, to, determine, longitude, validating, kepler, s, third, law, of, planetary, motion, and, determining, the, time, required, for, light, to, travel, between, jupiter, and, earth, based, on, ephemerides, produced, by, astronomer, giovanni, cassini, and, others, pierre, simon, laplace, created, a, mathematical, theory, to, explain, the, resonant, orbits, of, io, europa, and, ganymede, this, resonance, was, later, found, to, have, a, profound, effect, on, the, geologies, of, the, three, moons, improved, telescope, technology, in, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, allowed, astronomers, to, resolve, that, is, see, as, distinct, objects, large, scale, surface, features, on, io, in, the, 1890s, edward, e, barnard, was, the, first, to, observe, variations, in, io, s, brightness, between, its, equatorial, and, polar, regions, correctly, determining, that, this, was, due, to, differences, in, color, and, albedo, between, the, two, regions, and, not, due, to, io, being, egg, shaped, as, proposed, at, the, time, by, fellow, astronomer, william, pickering, or, two, separate, objects, as, initially, proposed, by, barnard, later, telescopic, observations, confirmed, io, s, distinct, reddish, brown, polar, regions, and, yellow, white, equatorial, band, telescopic, observations, in, the, mid, 20th, century, began, to, hint, at, io, s, unusual, nature, spectroscopic, observations, suggested, that, io, s, surface, was, devoid, of, water, ice, a, substance, found, to, be, plentiful, on, the, other, galilean, satellites, the, same, observations, suggested, a, surface, dominated, by, evaporates, composed, of, sodium, salts, and, sulfur, radiotelescopic, observations, revealed, io, s, influence, on, the, jovian, magnetosphere, as, demonstrated, by, decametric, wavelength, bursts, tied, to, the, orbital, period, of, io, the, first, spacecraft, to, pass, by, io, were, the, pioneer, 10, and, 11, probes, on, 3, december, 1973, and, 2, december, 1974, respectively, radio, tracking, provided, an, improved, estimate, of, io, s, mass, which, along, with, the, best, available, information, of, its, size, suggested, it, had, the, highest, density, of, the, galilean, satellites, and, was, composed, primarily, of, silicate, rock, rather, than, water, ice, the, pioneer, s, also, revealed, the, presence, of, a, thin, atmosphere, and, intense, radiation, belts, near, the, orbit, of, io, the, camera, on, board, pioneer, 11, took, the, only, good, image, of, the, moon, obtained, by, either, spacecraft, showing, its, north, polar, region, and, its, yellow, tint, close, up, images, were, planned, during, pioneer, 10, s, encounter, but, those, were, lost, because, of, the, high, radiation, environment, when, the, twin, probes, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, passed, by, io, in, 1979, their, more, advanced, imaging, systems, allowed, for, far, more, detailed, images, voyager, 1, flew, past, io, on, 5, march, 1979, from, a, distance, of, 20, 600, km, 12, 800, mi, the, images, returned, during, the, approach, revealed, a, strange, multi, colored, landscape, devoid, of, impact, craters, the, highest, resolution, images, showed, a, relatively, young, surface, punctuated, by, oddly, shaped, pits, mountains, taller, than, mount, everest, and, features, resembling, volcanic, lava, flows, shortly, after, the, encounter, voyager, navigation, engineer, linda, a, morabito, noticed, a, plume, emanating, from, the, surface, in, one, of, the, images, analysis, of, other, voyager, 1, images, showed, nine, such, plumes, scattered, across, the, surface, proving, that, io, was, volcanically, active, this, conclusion, was, predicted, in, a, paper, published, shortly, before, the, voyager, 1, encounter, by, stan, peale, patrick, cassen, and, r, t, reynolds, the, authors, calculated, that, io, s, interior, must, experience, significant, tidal, heating, caused, by, its, orbital, resonance, with, europa, and, ganymede, see, the, tidal, heating, section, for, a, more, detailed, explanation, of, the, process, data, from, this, flyby, showed, that, the, surface, of, io, is, dominated, by, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, frosts, these, compounds, also, dominate, its, thin, atmosphere, and, the, torus, of, plasma, centered, on, io, s, orbit, also, discovered, by, voyager, voyager, 2, passed, io, on, 9, july, 1979, at, a, distance, of, 1, 130, 000, km, 700, 000, mi, though, it, did, not, approach, nearly, as, close, as, voyager, 1, comparisons, between, images, taken, by, the, two, spacecraft, showed, several, surface, changes, that, had, occurred, in, the, four, months, between, the, encounters, in, addition, observations, of, io, as, a, crescent, as, voyager, 2, departed, the, jovian, system, revealed, that, seven, of, the, nine, plumes, observed, in, march, were, still, active, in, july, 1979, with, only, the, volcano, pele, shutting, down, between, flybys, the, galileo, spacecraft, arrived, at, jupiter, in, 1995, after, a, six, year, journey, from, earth, to, follow, up, on, the, discoveries, of, the, two, voyager, probes, and, the, ground, based, observations, made, in, the, intervening, years, io, s, location, within, one, of, jupiter, s, most, intense, radiation, belts, precluded, a, prolonged, close, flyby, but, galileo, did, pass, close, by, shortly, before, entering, orbit, for, its, two, year, primary, mission, studying, the, jovian, system, although, no, images, were, taken, during, the, close, flyby, on, 7, december, 1995, the, encounter, did, yield, significant, results, such, as, the, discovery, of, a, large, iron, core, similar, to, that, found, on, the, rocky, planets, of, the, inner, solar, system, despite, the, lack, of, close, up, imaging, and, mechanical, problems, that, greatly, restricted, the, amount, of, data, returned, several, significant, discoveries, were, made, during, galileo, s, primary, mission, galileo, observed, the, effects, of, a, major, eruption, at, pillan, patera, and, confirmed, that, volcanic, eruptions, are, composed, of, silicate, magmas, with, magnesium, rich, mafic, and, ultramafic, compositions, distant, imaging, of, io, was, acquired, for, almost, every, orbit, during, the, primary, mission, revealing, large, numbers, of, active, volcanoes, both, thermal, emission, from, cooling, magma, on, the, surface, and, volcanic, plumes, numerous, mountains, with, widely, varying, morphologies, and, several, surface, changes, that, had, taken, place, both, between, the, voyager, and, galileo, eras, and, between, galileo, orbits, the, galileo, mission, was, twice, extended, in, 1997, and, 2000, during, these, extended, missions, the, probe, flew, by, io, three, times, in, late, 1999, and, early, 2000, and, three, times, in, late, 2001, and, early, 2002, observations, during, these, encounters, revealed, the, geologic, processes, occurring, at, io, s, volcanoes, and, mountains, excluded, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, and, demonstrated, the, extent, of, volcanic, activity, in, december, 2000, the, cassini, spacecraft, had, a, distant, and, brief, encounter, with, the, jovian, system, en, route, to, saturn, allowing, for, joint, observations, with, galileo, these, observations, revealed, a, new, plume, at, tvashtar, paterae, and, provided, insights, into, io, s, aurorae, the, new, horizons, spacecraft, en, route, to, pluto, and, the, kuiper, belt, flew, by, the, jovian, system, and, io, on, 28, february, 2007, during, the, encounter, numerous, distant, observations, of, io, were, obtained, these, included, images, of, a, large, plume, at, tvashtar, providing, the, first, detailed, observations, of, the, largest, class, of, ionian, volcanic, plume, since, observations, of, pele, s, plume, in, 1979, new, horizons, also, captured, images, of, a, volcano, near, girru, patera, in, the, early, stages, of, an, eruption, and, several, volcanic, eruptions, that, have, occurred, since, galileo, the, juno, spacecraft, was, launched, in, 2011, and, entered, orbit, around, jupiter, on, 5, july, 2016, juno, s, mission, is, primarily, focused, on, improving, our, understanding, of, jupiter, s, interior, magnetic, field, aurorae, and, polar, atmosphere, juno, s, 54, day, orbit, is, highly, inclined, and, highly, eccentric, in, order, to, better, characterize, jupiter, s, polar, regions, and, to, limit, its, exposure, to, the, planet, s, harsh, inner, radiation, belts, limiting, close, encounters, with, jupiter, s, moons, the, closest, approach, to, io, during, the, initial, prime, mission, occurred, in, february, 2020, at, a, distance, of, 195, 000, kilomters, juno, s, extended, mission, begun, in, june, 2021, allowed, for, closer, encounters, with, jupiter, s, galilean, satellites, due, to, juno, s, orbital, precession, after, a, series, of, increasingly, closer, encounters, with, io, in, 2022, and, 2023, juno, performed, a, pair, of, close, flybys, on, 30, december, 2023, and, 3, february, 2024, both, with, altitudes, of, 1, 500, kilometers, the, primary, goal, of, these, encounters, were, to, improve, our, understanding, of, io, s, gravity, field, using, doppler, tracking, and, to, image, io, s, surface, to, look, for, surface, changes, since, io, was, last, seen, up, close, in, 2007, during, several, orbits, juno, has, observed, io, from, a, distance, using, junocam, a, wide, angle, visible, light, camera, to, look, for, volcanic, plumes, and, jiram, a, near, infrared, spectrometer, and, imager, to, monitor, thermal, emission, from, io, s, volcanoes, jiram, near, infrared, spectroscopy, has, so, far, allowed, for, the, coarse, mapping, of, sulfur, dioxide, frost, across, io, s, surface, as, well, as, mapping, minor, surface, components, weakly, absorbing, sunlight, at, 2, 1, and, 2, 65, m, there, are, two, forthcoming, missions, planned, for, the, jovian, system, the, jupiter, icy, moon, explorer, juice, is, a, planned, european, space, agency, mission, to, the, jovian, system, that, is, intended, to, end, up, in, ganymede, orbit, juice, launched, in, april, 2023, with, arrival, at, jupiter, planned, for, july, 2031, juice, will, not, fly, by, io, but, it, will, use, its, instruments, such, as, a, narrow, angle, camera, to, monitor, io, s, volcanic, activity, and, measure, its, surface, composition, during, the, two, year, jupiter, tour, phase, of, the, mission, prior, to, ganymede, orbit, insertion, europa, clipper, is, a, planned, nasa, mission, to, the, jovian, system, focused, on, jupiter, s, moon, europa, like, juice, europa, clipper, will, not, perform, any, flybys, of, io, but, distant, volcano, monitoring, is, likely, europa, clipper, has, a, planned, launch, in, 2024, with, an, arrival, at, jupiter, in, 2030, the, io, volcano, observer, ivo, was, a, proposal, to, nasa, for, a, low, cost, discovery, class, mission, selected, for, a, phase, a, study, along, with, three, other, missions, in, 2020, ivo, would, launch, in, january, 2029, and, perform, ten, flybys, of, io, while, in, orbit, around, jupiter, beginning, in, the, early, 2030s, however, the, venus, missions, davinci, and, veritas, were, selected, in, favor, of, those, io, orbits, jupiter, at, a, distance, of, 421, 700, km, 262, 000, mi, from, jupiter, s, center, and, 350, 000, km, 217, 000, mi, from, its, cloudtops, it, is, the, innermost, of, the, galilean, satellites, of, jupiter, its, orbit, lying, between, those, of, thebe, and, europa, including, jupiter, s, inner, satellites, io, is, the, fifth, moon, out, from, jupiter, it, takes, io, about, 42, 5, hours, 1, 77, days, to, complete, one, orbit, around, jupiter, fast, enough, for, its, motion, to, be, observed, over, a, single, night, of, observation, io, is, in, a, 2, 1, mean, motion, orbital, resonance, with, europa, and, a, 4, 1, mean, motion, orbital, resonance, with, ganymede, completing, two, orbits, of, jupiter, for, every, one, orbit, completed, by, europa, and, four, orbits, for, every, one, completed, by, ganymede, this, resonance, helps, maintain, io, s, orbital, eccentricity, 0, 0041, which, in, turn, provides, the, primary, heating, source, for, its, geologic, activity, without, this, forced, eccentricity, io, s, orbit, would, circularize, through, tidal, dissipation, leading, to, a, less, geologically, active, world, like, the, other, galilean, satellites, and, the, moon, io, rotates, synchronously, with, its, orbital, period, keeping, one, face, nearly, pointed, toward, jupiter, this, synchrony, provides, the, definition, for, io, s, longitude, system, io, s, prime, meridian, intersects, the, equator, at, the, sub, jovian, point, the, side, of, io, that, always, faces, jupiter, is, known, as, the, subjovian, hemisphere, whereas, the, side, that, always, faces, away, is, known, as, the, antijovian, hemisphere, the, side, of, io, that, always, faces, in, the, direction, that, io, travels, in, its, orbit, is, known, as, the, leading, hemisphere, whereas, the, side, that, always, faces, in, the, opposite, direction, is, known, as, the, trailing, hemisphere, from, the, surface, of, io, jupiter, would, subtend, an, arc, of, 19, 5, making, jupiter, appear, 39, times, the, apparent, diameter, of, earth, s, moon, io, plays, a, significant, role, in, shaping, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, acting, as, an, electric, generator, that, can, develop, 400, 000, volts, across, itself, and, create, an, electric, current, of, 3, million, amperes, releasing, ions, that, give, jupiter, a, magnetic, field, inflated, to, more, than, twice, the, size, it, would, otherwise, have, the, magnetosphere, of, jupiter, sweeps, up, gases, and, dust, from, io, s, thin, atmosphere, at, a, rate, of, 1, tonne, per, second, this, material, is, mostly, composed, of, ionized, and, atomic, sulfur, oxygen, and, chlorine, atomic, sodium, and, potassium, molecular, sulfur, dioxide, and, sulfur, and, sodium, chloride, dust, these, materials, originate, from, io, s, volcanic, activity, with, the, material, that, escapes, to, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, and, into, interplanetary, space, coming, directly, from, io, s, atmosphere, these, materials, depending, on, their, ionized, state, and, composition, end, up, in, various, neutral, non, ionized, clouds, and, radiation, belts, in, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, and, in, some, cases, are, eventually, ejected, from, the, jovian, system, surrounding, io, at, a, distance, of, up, to, six, io, radii, from, its, surface, is, a, cloud, of, neutral, sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and, potassium, atoms, these, particles, originate, in, io, s, upper, atmosphere, and, are, excited, by, collisions, with, ions, in, the, plasma, torus, discussed, below, and, by, other, processes, into, filling, io, s, hill, sphere, which, is, the, region, where, io, s, gravity, is, dominant, over, jupiter, s, some, of, this, material, escapes, io, s, gravitational, pull, and, goes, into, orbit, around, jupiter, over, a, 20, hour, period, these, particles, spread, out, from, io, to, form, a, banana, shaped, neutral, cloud, that, can, reach, as, far, as, six, jovian, radii, from, io, either, inside, io, s, orbit, and, ahead, of, it, or, outside, io, s, orbit, and, behind, it, the, collision, process, that, excites, these, particles, also, occasionally, provides, sodium, ions, in, the, plasma, torus, with, an, electron, removing, those, new, fast, neutrals, from, the, torus, these, particles, retain, their, velocity, 70, km, s, compared, to, the, 17, km, s, orbital, velocity, at, io, and, are, thus, ejected, in, jets, leading, away, from, io, io, orbits, within, a, belt, of, intense, radiation, known, as, the, io, plasma, torus, the, plasma, in, this, doughnut, shaped, ring, of, ionized, sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and, chlorine, originates, when, neutral, atoms, in, the, cloud, surrounding, io, are, ionized, and, carried, along, by, the, jovian, magnetosphere, unlike, the, particles, in, the, neutral, cloud, these, particles, co, rotate, with, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, revolving, around, jupiter, at, 74, km, s, like, the, rest, of, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, the, plasma, torus, is, tilted, with, respect, to, jupiter, s, equator, and, io, s, orbital, plane, so, that, io, is, at, times, below, and, at, other, times, above, the, core, of, the, plasma, torus, as, noted, above, these, ions, higher, velocity, and, energy, levels, are, partly, responsible, for, the, removal, of, neutral, atoms, and, molecules, from, io, s, atmosphere, and, more, extended, neutral, clouds, the, torus, is, composed, of, three, sections, an, outer, warm, torus, that, resides, just, outside, io, s, orbit, a, vertically, extended, region, known, as, the, ribbon, composed, of, the, neutral, source, region, and, cooling, plasma, located, at, around, io, s, distance, from, jupiter, and, an, inner, cold, torus, composed, of, particles, that, are, slowly, spiraling, in, toward, jupiter, after, residing, an, average, of, 40, days, in, the, torus, particles, in, the, warm, torus, escape, and, are, partially, responsible, for, jupiter, s, unusually, large, magnetosphere, their, outward, pressure, inflating, it, from, within, particles, from, io, detected, as, variations, in, magnetospheric, plasma, have, been, detected, far, into, the, long, magnetotail, by, new, horizons, to, study, similar, variations, within, the, plasma, torus, researchers, measured, the, ultraviolet, light, it, emits, although, such, variations, have, not, been, definitively, linked, to, variations, in, io, s, volcanic, activity, the, ultimate, source, for, material, in, the, plasma, torus, this, link, has, been, established, in, the, neutral, sodium, cloud, during, an, encounter, with, jupiter, in, 1992, the, ulysses, spacecraft, detected, a, stream, of, dust, sized, particles, being, ejected, from, the, jovian, system, the, dust, in, these, discrete, streams, travels, away, from, jupiter, at, speeds, upwards, of, several, hundred, kilometers, per, second, has, an, average, particle, size, of, 10, m, and, consists, primarily, of, sodium, chloride, dust, measurements, by, galileo, showed, that, these, dust, streams, originated, on, io, but, exactly, how, these, form, whether, from, io, s, volcanic, activity, or, material, removed, from, the, surface, is, unknown, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, which, io, crosses, couples, io, s, atmosphere, and, neutral, cloud, to, jupiter, s, polar, upper, atmosphere, by, generating, an, electric, current, known, as, the, io, flux, tube, this, current, produces, an, auroral, glow, in, jupiter, s, polar, regions, known, as, the, io, footprint, as, well, as, aurorae, in, io, s, atmosphere, particles, from, this, auroral, interaction, darken, the, jovian, polar, regions, at, visible, wavelengths, the, location, of, io, and, its, auroral, footprint, with, respect, to, earth, and, jupiter, has, a, strong, influence, on, jovian, radio, emissions, from, our, vantage, point, when, io, is, visible, radio, signals, from, jupiter, increase, considerably, the, juno, mission, currently, in, orbit, around, jupiter, should, help, shed, light, on, these, processes, the, jovian, magnetic, field, lines, that, do, get, past, io, s, ionosphere, also, induce, an, electric, current, which, in, turn, creates, an, induced, magnetic, field, within, io, s, interior, io, s, induced, magnetic, field, is, thought, to, be, generated, within, a, partially, molten, silicate, magma, ocean, 50, kilometers, beneath, io, s, surface, similar, induced, fields, were, found, at, the, other, galilean, satellites, by, galileo, possibly, generated, within, liquid, water, oceans, in, the, interiors, of, those, moons, io, is, slightly, larger, than, earth, s, moon, it, has, a, mean, radius, of, 1, 821, 3, km, 1, 131, 7, mi, about, 5, greater, than, the, moon, s, and, a, mass, of, 8, 9319, 10, 22, kg, about, 21, greater, than, the, moon, s, it, is, a, slight, ellipsoid, in, shape, with, its, longest, axis, directed, toward, jupiter, among, the, galilean, satellites, in, both, mass, and, volume, io, ranks, behind, ganymede, and, callisto, but, ahead, of, europa, composed, primarily, of, silicate, rock, and, iron, io, and, europa, are, closer, in, bulk, composition, to, terrestrial, planets, than, to, other, satellites, in, the, outer, solar, system, which, are, mostly, composed, of, a, mix, of, water, ice, and, silicates, io, has, a, density, of, 3, 5275, g, cm, 3, the, highest, of, any, regular, moon, in, the, solar, system, significantly, higher, than, the, other, galilean, satellites, ganymede, and, callisto, in, particular, whose, densities, are, around, 1, 9, g, cm, 3, and, slightly, higher, 5, 5, than, the, moon, s, 3, 344, g, cm, 3, and, europa, s, 2, 989, g, cm, 3, models, based, on, the, voyager, and, galileo, measurements, of, io, s, mass, radius, and, quadrupole, gravitational, coefficients, numerical, values, related, to, how, mass, is, distributed, within, an, object, suggest, that, its, interior, is, differentiated, between, a, silicate, rich, crust, and, mantle, and, an, iron, or, iron, sulfide, rich, core, io, s, metallic, core, makes, up, approximately, 20, of, its, mass, depending, on, the, amount, of, sulfur, in, the, core, the, core, has, a, radius, between, 350, and, 650, km, 220, 400, mi, if, it, is, composed, almost, entirely, of, iron, or, between, 550, and, 900, km, 340, 560, mi, for, a, core, consisting, of, a, mix, of, iron, and, sulfur, galileo, s, magnetometer, failed, to, detect, an, internal, intrinsic, magnetic, field, at, io, suggesting, that, the, core, is, not, convecting, modeling, of, io, s, interior, composition, suggests, that, the, mantle, is, composed, of, at, least, 75, of, the, magnesium, rich, mineral, forsterite, and, has, a, bulk, composition, similar, to, that, of, l, chondrite, and, ll, chondrite, meteorites, with, higher, iron, content, compared, to, silicon, than, the, moon, or, earth, but, lower, than, mars, to, support, the, heat, flow, observed, on, io, 10, 20, of, io, s, mantle, may, be, molten, though, regions, where, high, temperature, volcanism, has, been, observed, may, have, higher, melt, fractions, however, re, analysis, of, galileo, magnetometer, data, in, 2009, revealed, the, presence, of, an, induced, magnetic, field, at, io, requiring, a, magma, ocean, 50, km, 31, mi, below, the, surface, further, analysis, published, in, 2011, provided, direct, evidence, of, such, an, ocean, this, layer, is, estimated, to, be, 50, km, thick, and, to, make, up, about, 10, of, io, s, mantle, it, is, estimated, that, the, temperature, in, the, magma, ocean, reaches, 1, 200, c, it, is, not, known, if, the, 10, 20, partial, melting, percentage, for, io, s, mantle, is, consistent, with, the, requirement, for, a, significant, amount, of, molten, silicates, in, this, possible, magma, ocean, the, lithosphere, of, io, composed, of, basalt, and, sulfur, deposited, by, io, s, extensive, volcanism, is, at, least, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, thick, and, likely, less, than, 40, km, 25, mi, thick, unlike, earth, and, the, moon, io, s, main, source, of, internal, heat, comes, from, tidal, dissipation, rather, than, radioactive, isotope, decay, the, result, of, io, s, orbital, resonance, with, europa, and, ganymede, such, heating, is, dependent, on, io, s, distance, from, jupiter, its, orbital, eccentricity, the, composition, of, its, interior, and, its, physical, state, its, laplace, resonance, with, europa, and, ganymede, maintains, io, s, eccentricity, and, prevents, tidal, dissipation, within, io, from, circularizing, its, orbit, the, resonant, orbit, also, helps, to, maintain, io, s, distance, from, jupiter, otherwise, tides, raised, on, jupiter, would, cause, io, to, slowly, spiral, outward, from, its, parent, planet, the, tidal, forces, experienced, by, io, are, about, 20, 000, times, stronger, than, the, tidal, forces, earth, experiences, due, to, the, moon, and, the, vertical, differences, in, its, tidal, bulge, between, the, times, io, is, at, periapsis, and, apoapsis, in, its, orbit, could, be, as, much, as, 100, m, 330, ft, the, friction, or, tidal, dissipation, produced, in, io, s, interior, due, to, this, varying, tidal, pull, which, without, the, resonant, orbit, would, have, gone, into, circularizing, io, s, orbit, instead, creates, significant, tidal, heating, within, io, s, interior, melting, a, significant, amount, of, io, s, mantle, and, core, the, amount, of, energy, produced, is, up, to, 200, times, greater, than, that, produced, solely, from, radioactive, decay, this, heat, is, released, in, the, form, of, volcanic, activity, generating, its, observed, high, heat, flow, global, total, 0, 6, to, 1, 6, 10, 14, w, models, of, its, orbit, suggest, that, the, amount, of, tidal, heating, within, io, changes, with, time, however, the, current, amount, of, tidal, dissipation, is, consistent, with, the, observed, heat, flow, models, of, tidal, heating, and, convection, have, not, found, consistent, planetary, viscosity, profiles, that, simultaneously, match, tidal, energy, dissipation, and, mantle, convection, of, heat, to, the, surface, although, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, origin, of, the, heat, as, manifested, in, io, s, many, volcanoes, is, tidal, heating, from, the, pull, of, gravity, from, jupiter, and, its, moon, europa, the, volcanoes, are, not, in, the, positions, predicted, with, tidal, heating, they, are, shifted, 30, to, 60, degrees, to, the, east, a, study, published, by, tyler, et, al, 2015, suggests, that, this, eastern, shift, may, be, caused, by, an, ocean, of, molten, rock, under, the, surface, the, movement, of, this, magma, would, generate, extra, heat, through, friction, due, to, its, viscosity, the, study, s, authors, believe, that, this, subsurface, ocean, is, a, mixture, of, molten, and, solid, rock, other, moons, in, the, solar, system, are, also, tidally, heated, and, they, too, may, generate, additional, heat, through, the, friction, of, subsurface, magma, or, water, oceans, this, ability, to, generate, heat, in, a, subsurface, ocean, increases, the, chance, of, life, on, bodies, like, europa, and, enceladus, based, on, their, experience, with, the, ancient, surfaces, of, the, moon, mars, and, mercury, scientists, expected, to, see, numerous, impact, craters, in, voyager, 1, s, first, images, of, io, the, density, of, impact, craters, across, io, s, surface, would, have, given, clues, to, io, s, age, however, they, were, surprised, to, discover, that, the, surface, was, almost, completely, lacking, in, impact, craters, but, was, instead, covered, in, smooth, plains, dotted, with, tall, mountains, pits, of, various, shapes, and, sizes, and, volcanic, lava, flows, compared, to, most, worlds, observed, to, that, point, io, s, surface, was, covered, in, a, variety, of, colorful, materials, leading, io, to, be, compared, to, a, rotten, orange, or, to, pizza, from, various, sulfurous, compounds, the, lack, of, impact, craters, indicated, that, io, s, surface, is, geologically, young, like, the, terrestrial, surface, volcanic, materials, continuously, bury, craters, as, they, are, produced, this, result, was, spectacularly, confirmed, as, at, least, nine, active, volcanoes, were, observed, by, voyager, 1, io, s, colorful, appearance, is, the, result, of, materials, deposited, by, its, extensive, volcanism, including, silicates, such, as, orthopyroxene, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, sulfur, dioxide, frost, is, ubiquitous, across, the, surface, of, io, forming, large, regions, covered, in, white, or, grey, materials, sulfur, is, also, seen, in, many, places, across, io, forming, yellow, to, yellow, green, regions, sulfur, deposited, in, the, mid, latitude, and, polar, regions, is, often, damaged, by, radiation, breaking, up, the, normally, stable, cyclic, 8, chain, sulfur, this, radiation, damage, produces, io, s, red, brown, polar, regions, explosive, volcanism, often, taking, the, form, of, umbrella, shaped, plumes, paints, the, surface, with, sulfurous, and, silicate, materials, plume, deposits, on, io, are, often, colored, red, or, white, depending, on, the, amount, of, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, plume, generally, plumes, formed, at, volcanic, vents, from, degassing, lava, contain, a, greater, amount, of, s, 2, producing, a, red, fan, deposit, or, in, extreme, cases, large, often, reaching, beyond, 450, km, or, 280, mi, from, the, central, vent, red, rings, a, prominent, example, of, a, red, ring, plume, deposit, is, located, at, pele, these, red, deposits, consist, primarily, of, sulfur, generally, 3, and, 4, chain, molecular, sulfur, sulfur, dioxide, and, perhaps, sulfuryl, chloride, plumes, formed, at, the, margins, of, silicate, lava, flows, through, the, interaction, of, lava, and, pre, existing, deposits, of, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, produce, white, or, gray, deposits, compositional, mapping, and, io, s, high, density, suggest, that, io, contains, little, to, no, water, though, small, pockets, of, water, ice, or, hydrated, minerals, have, been, tentatively, identified, most, notably, on, the, northwest, flank, of, the, mountain, gish, bar, mons, io, has, the, least, amount, of, water, of, any, known, body, in, the, solar, system, this, lack, of, water, is, likely, due, to, jupiter, being, hot, enough, early, in, the, evolution, of, the, solar, system, to, drive, off, volatile, materials, like, water, in, the, vicinity, of, io, but, not, hot, enough, to, do, so, farther, out, the, tidal, heating, produced, by, io, s, forced, orbital, eccentricity, has, made, it, the, most, volcanically, active, world, in, the, solar, system, with, hundreds, of, volcanic, centers, and, extensive, lava, flows, during, a, major, eruption, lava, flows, tens, or, even, hundreds, of, kilometers, long, can, be, produced, consisting, mostly, of, basalt, silicate, lavas, with, either, mafic, or, ultramafic, magnesium, rich, compositions, as, a, by, product, of, this, activity, sulfur, sulfur, dioxide, gas, and, silicate, pyroclastic, material, like, ash, are, blown, up, to, 200, km, 120, mi, into, space, producing, large, umbrella, shaped, plumes, painting, the, surrounding, terrain, in, red, black, and, white, and, providing, material, for, io, s, patchy, atmosphere, and, jupiter, s, extensive, magnetosphere, io, s, surface, is, dotted, with, volcanic, depressions, known, as, paterae, which, generally, have, flat, floors, bounded, by, steep, walls, these, features, resemble, terrestrial, calderas, but, it, is, unknown, if, they, are, produced, through, collapse, over, an, emptied, lava, chamber, like, their, terrestrial, cousins, one, hypothesis, suggests, that, these, features, are, produced, through, the, exhumation, of, volcanic, sills, and, the, overlying, material, is, either, blasted, out, or, integrated, into, the, sill, examples, of, paterae, in, various, stages, of, exhumation, have, been, mapped, using, galileo, images, of, the, chaac, camaxtli, region, unlike, similar, features, on, earth, and, mars, these, depressions, generally, do, not, lie, at, the, peak, of, shield, volcanoes, and, are, normally, larger, with, an, average, diameter, of, 41, km, 25, mi, the, largest, being, loki, patera, at, 202, km, 126, mi, loki, is, also, consistently, the, strongest, volcano, on, io, contributing, on, average, 25, of, io, s, global, heat, output, whatever, the, formation, mechanism, the, morphology, and, distribution, of, many, paterae, suggest, that, these, features, are, structurally, controlled, with, at, least, half, bounded, by, faults, or, mountains, these, features, are, often, the, site, of, volcanic, eruptions, either, from, lava, flows, spreading, across, the, floors, of, the, paterae, as, at, an, eruption, at, gish, bar, patera, in, 2001, or, in, the, form, of, a, lava, lake, lava, lakes, on, io, either, have, a, continuously, overturning, lava, crust, such, as, at, pele, or, an, episodically, overturning, crust, such, as, at, loki, lava, flows, represent, another, major, volcanic, terrain, on, io, magma, erupts, onto, the, surface, from, vents, on, the, floor, of, paterae, or, on, the, plains, from, fissures, producing, inflated, compound, lava, flows, similar, to, those, seen, at, kilauea, in, hawaii, images, from, the, galileo, spacecraft, revealed, that, many, of, io, s, major, lava, flows, like, those, at, prometheus, and, amirani, are, produced, by, the, build, up, of, small, breakouts, of, lava, flows, on, top, of, older, flows, larger, outbreaks, of, lava, have, also, been, observed, on, io, for, example, the, leading, edge, of, the, prometheus, flow, moved, 75, to, 95, km, 47, to, 59, mi, between, voyager, in, 1979, and, the, first, galileo, observations, in, 1996, a, major, eruption, in, 1997, produced, more, than, 3, 500, km, 2, 1, 400, sq, mi, of, fresh, lava, and, flooded, the, floor, of, the, adjacent, pillan, patera, analysis, of, the, voyager, images, led, scientists, to, believe, that, these, flows, were, composed, mostly, of, various, compounds, of, molten, sulfur, however, subsequent, earth, based, infrared, studies, and, measurements, from, the, galileo, spacecraft, indicate, that, these, flows, are, composed, of, basaltic, lava, with, mafic, to, ultramafic, compositions, this, hypothesis, is, based, on, temperature, measurements, of, io, s, hotspots, or, thermal, emission, locations, which, suggest, temperatures, of, at, least, 1, 300, k, and, some, as, high, as, 1, 600, k, initial, estimates, suggesting, eruption, temperatures, approaching, 2, 000, k, have, since, proven, to, be, overestimates, because, the, wrong, thermal, models, were, used, to, model, the, temperatures, the, discovery, of, plumes, at, the, volcanoes, pele, and, loki, were, the, first, sign, that, io, is, geologically, active, generally, these, plumes, are, formed, when, volatiles, like, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, are, ejected, skyward, from, io, s, volcanoes, at, speeds, reaching, 1, km, s, 0, 62, mi, s, creating, umbrella, shaped, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, additional, material, that, might, be, found, in, these, volcanic, plumes, include, sodium, potassium, and, chlorine, these, plumes, appear, to, be, formed, in, one, of, two, ways, io, s, largest, plumes, such, as, those, emitted, by, pele, are, created, when, dissolved, sulfur, and, sulfur, dioxide, gas, are, released, from, erupting, magma, at, volcanic, vents, or, lava, lakes, often, dragging, silicate, pyroclastic, material, with, them, these, plumes, form, red, from, the, short, chain, sulfur, and, black, from, the, silicate, pyroclastics, deposits, on, the, surface, plumes, formed, in, this, manner, are, among, the, largest, observed, at, io, forming, red, rings, more, than, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, in, diameter, examples, of, this, plume, type, include, pele, tvashtar, and, dazhbog, another, type, of, plume, is, produced, when, encroaching, lava, flows, vaporize, underlying, sulfur, dioxide, frost, sending, the, sulfur, skyward, this, type, of, plume, often, forms, bright, circular, deposits, consisting, of, sulfur, dioxide, these, plumes, are, often, less, than, 100, km, 62, mi, tall, and, are, among, the, most, long, lived, plumes, on, io, examples, include, prometheus, amirani, and, masubi, the, erupted, sulfurous, compounds, are, concentrated, in, the, upper, crust, from, a, decrease, in, sulfur, solubility, at, greater, depths, in, io, s, lithosphere, and, can, be, a, determinant, for, the, eruption, style, of, a, hot, spot, io, has, 100, to, 150, mountains, these, structures, average, 6, km, 3, 7, mi, in, height, and, reach, a, maximum, of, 17, 5, 1, 5, km, 10, 9, 0, 9, mi, at, south, bo, saule, montes, mountains, often, appear, as, large, the, average, mountain, is, 157, km, or, 98, mi, long, isolated, structures, with, no, apparent, global, tectonic, patterns, outlined, in, contrast, to, the, case, on, earth, to, support, the, tremendous, topography, observed, at, these, mountains, requires, compositions, consisting, mostly, of, silicate, rock, as, opposed, to, sulfur, despite, the, extensive, volcanism, that, gives, io, its, distinctive, appearance, nearly, all, of, its, mountains, are, tectonic, structures, and, are, not, produced, by, volcanoes, instead, most, ionian, mountains, form, as, the, result, of, compressive, stresses, on, the, base, of, the, lithosphere, which, uplift, and, often, tilt, chunks, of, io, s, crust, through, thrust, faulting, the, compressive, stresses, leading, to, mountain, formation, are, the, result, of, subsidence, from, the, continuous, burial, of, volcanic, materials, the, global, distribution, of, mountains, appears, to, be, opposite, that, of, volcanic, structures, mountains, dominate, areas, with, fewer, volcanoes, and, vice, versa, this, suggests, large, scale, regions, in, io, s, lithosphere, where, compression, supportive, of, mountain, formation, and, extension, supportive, of, patera, formation, dominate, locally, however, mountains, and, paterae, often, abut, one, another, suggesting, that, magma, often, exploits, faults, formed, during, mountain, formation, to, reach, the, surface, mountains, on, io, generally, structures, rising, above, the, surrounding, plains, have, a, variety, of, morphologies, plateaus, are, most, common, these, structures, resemble, large, flat, topped, mesas, with, rugged, surfaces, other, mountains, appear, to, be, tilted, crustal, blocks, with, a, shallow, slope, from, the, formerly, flat, surface, and, a, steep, slope, consisting, of, formerly, sub, surface, materials, uplifted, by, compressive, stresses, both, types, of, mountains, often, have, steep, scarps, along, one, or, more, margins, only, a, handful, of, mountains, on, io, appear, to, have, a, volcanic, origin, these, mountains, resemble, small, shield, volcanoes, with, steep, slopes, 6, 7, near, a, small, central, caldera, and, shallow, slopes, along, their, margins, these, volcanic, mountains, are, often, smaller, than, the, average, mountain, on, io, averaging, only, 1, to, 2, km, 0, 6, to, 1, 2, mi, in, height, and, 40, to, 60, km, 25, to, 37, mi, wide, other, shield, volcanoes, with, much, shallower, slopes, are, inferred, from, the, morphology, of, several, of, io, s, volcanoes, where, thin, flows, radiate, out, from, a, central, patera, such, as, at, ra, patera, nearly, all, mountains, appear, to, be, in, some, stage, of, degradation, large, landslide, deposits, are, common, at, the, base, of, ionian, mountains, suggesting, that, mass, wasting, is, the, primary, form, of, degradation, scalloped, margins, are, common, among, io, s, mesas, and, plateaus, the, result, of, sulfur, dioxide, sapping, from, io, s, crust, producing, zones, of, weakness, along, mountain, margins, io, has, an, extremely, thin, atmosphere, consisting, mainly, of, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, with, minor, constituents, including, sulfur, monoxide, so, sodium, chloride, nacl, and, atomic, sulfur, and, oxygen, the, atmosphere, has, significant, variations, in, density, and, temperature, with, time, of, day, latitude, volcanic, activity, and, surface, frost, abundance, the, maximum, atmospheric, pressure, on, io, ranges, from, 3, 3, 10, 5, to, 3, 10, 4, pascals, pa, or, 0, 3, to, 3, nbar, spatially, seen, on, io, s, anti, jupiter, hemisphere, and, along, the, equator, and, temporally, in, the, early, afternoon, when, the, temperature, of, surface, frost, peaks, localized, peaks, at, volcanic, plumes, have, also, been, seen, with, pressures, of, 5, 10, 4, to, 40, 10, 4, pa, 5, to, 40, nbar, io, s, atmospheric, pressure, is, lowest, on, io, s, night, side, where, the, pressure, dips, to, 0, 1, 10, 7, to, 1, 10, 7, pa, 0, 0001, to, 0, 001, nbar, io, s, atmospheric, temperature, ranges, from, the, temperature, of, the, surface, at, low, altitudes, where, sulfur, dioxide, is, in, vapor, pressure, equilibrium, with, frost, on, the, surface, to, 1, 800, k, at, higher, altitudes, where, the, lower, atmospheric, density, permits, heating, from, plasma, in, the, io, plasma, torus, and, from, joule, heating, from, the, io, flux, tube, the, low, pressure, limits, the, atmosphere, s, effect, on, the, surface, except, for, temporarily, redistributing, sulfur, dioxide, from, frost, rich, to, frost, poor, areas, and, to, expand, the, size, of, plume, deposit, rings, when, plume, material, re, enters, the, thicker, dayside, atmosphere, gas, in, io, s,

be, constantly, replenished, the, most, dramatic, source, of, so, 2, are, volcanic, plumes, which, pump, 10, 4, kg, of, sulfur, dioxide, per, second, into, io, s, atmosphere, on, average, though, most, of, this, condenses, back, onto, the, surface, much, of, the, sulfur, dioxide, in, io, s, atmosphere, is, sustained, by, sunlight, driven, sublimation, of, so, 2, frozen, on, the, surface, the, day, side, atmosphere, is, largely, confined, to, within, 40, of, the, equator, where, the, surface, is, warmest, and, most, active, volcanic, plumes, reside, a, sublimation, driven, atmosphere, is, also, consistent, with, observations, that, io, s, atmosphere, is, densest, over, the, anti, jupiter, hemisphere, where, so, 2, frost, is, most, abundant, and, is, densest, when, io, is, closer, to, the, sun, however, some, contributions, from, volcanic, plumes, are, required, as, the, highest, observed, densities, have, been, seen, near, volcanic, vents, because, the, density, of, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, is, tied, directly, to, surface, temperature, io, s, atmosphere, partially, collapses, at, night, or, when, io, is, in, the, shadow, of, jupiter, with, an, 80, drop, in, column, density, the, collapse, during, eclipse, is, limited, somewhat, by, the, formation, of, a, diffusion, layer, of, sulfur, monoxide, in, the, lowest, portion, of, the, atmosphere, but, the, atmosphere, pressure, of, io, s, nightside, atmosphere, is, two, to, four, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, at, its, peak, just, past, noon, the, minor, constituents, of, io, s, atmosphere, such, as, nacl, so, o, and, s, derive, either, from, direct, volcanic, outgassing, photodissociation, or, chemical, breakdown, caused, by, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, from, so, 2, or, the, sputtering, of, surface, deposits, by, charged, particles, from, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, various, researchers, have, proposed, that, the, atmosphere, of, io, freezes, onto, the, surface, when, it, passes, into, the, shadow, of, jupiter, evidence, for, this, is, a, post, eclipse, brightening, where, the, moon, sometimes, appears, a, bit, brighter, as, if, covered, with, frost, immediately, after, eclipse, after, about, 15, minutes, the, brightness, returns, to, normal, presumably, because, the, frost, has, disappeared, through, sublimation, besides, being, seen, through, ground, based, telescopes, post, eclipse, brightening, was, found, in, near, infrared, wavelengths, using, an, instrument, aboard, the, cassini, spacecraft, further, support, for, this, idea, came, in, 2013, when, the, gemini, observatory, was, used, to, directly, measure, the, collapse, of, io, s, so, 2, atmosphere, during, and, its, reformation, after, eclipse, with, jupiter, high, resolution, images, of, io, acquired, when, io, is, experiencing, an, eclipse, reveal, an, aurora, like, glow, as, on, earth, this, is, due, to, particle, radiation, hitting, the, atmosphere, though, in, this, case, the, charged, particles, come, from, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, rather, than, the, solar, wind, aurorae, usually, occur, near, the, magnetic, poles, of, planets, but, io, s, are, brightest, near, its, equator, io, lacks, an, intrinsic, magnetic, field, of, its, own, therefore, electrons, traveling, along, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, near, io, directly, impact, io, s, atmosphere, more, electrons, collide, with, its, atmosphere, producing, the, brightest, aurora, where, the, field, lines, are, tangent, to, io, i, e, near, the, equator, because, the, column, of, gas, they, pass, through, is, the, longest, there, aurorae, associated, with, these, tangent, points, on, io, are, observed, to, rock, with, the, changing, orientation, of, jupiter, s, tilted, magnetic, dipole, fainter, aurora, from, oxygen, atoms, along, the, limb, of, io, the, red, glows, in, the, image, at, right, and, sodium, atoms, on, io, s, night, side, the, green, glows, in, the, same, image, have, also, been, observed, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster,
