the, paleozoic, p, l, i, z, o, k, i, o, p, e, pal, ee, zoh, ik, ee, oh, pay, or, palaeozoic, era, is, the, first, of, three, geological, eras, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, beginning, 538, 8, million, years, ago, ma, it, succeeds, the, neoproterozoic, the, last, era, of, the, proterozoic, eon, and, ends, 251, 9, ma, at, the, start, of, the, mesozoic, era, the, paleozoic, is, subdivided, into, six, geologic, periods, from, oldest, to, youngest, some, geological, timescales, divide, the, paleozoic, informally, into, early, and, late, sub, eras, the, early, paleozoic, consisting, of, the, cambrian, ordovician, and, silurian, the, late, paleozoic, consisting, of, the, devonian, carboniferous, and, permian, the, name, paleozoic, was, first, used, by, adam, sedgwick, 1785, 1873, in, 1838, to, describe, the, cambrian, and, ordovician, periods, it, was, redefined, by, john, phillips, 1800, 1874, in, 1840, to, cover, the, cambrian, to, permian, periods, it, is, derived, from, the, greek, palai, s, old, and, z, life, meaning, ancient, life, the, paleozoic, was, a, time, of, dramatic, geological, climatic, and, evolutionary, change, the, cambrian, witnessed, the, most, rapid, and, widespread, diversification, of, life, in, earth, s, history, known, as, the, cambrian, explosion, in, which, most, modern, phyla, first, appeared, arthropods, molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and, synapsids, all, evolved, during, the, paleozoic, life, began, in, the, ocean, but, eventually, transitioned, onto, land, and, by, the, late, paleozoic, great, forests, of, primitive, plants, covered, the, continents, many, of, which, formed, the, coal, beds, of, europe, and, eastern, north, america, towards, the, end, of, the, era, large, sophisticated, synapsids, and, diapsids, were, dominant, and, the, first, modern, plants, conifers, appeared, the, paleozoic, era, ended, with, the, largest, extinction, event, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, effects, of, this, catastrophe, were, so, devastating, that, it, took, life, on, land, 30, million, years, into, the, mesozoic, era, to, recover, recovery, of, life, in, the, sea, may, have, been, much, faster, the, base, of, the, paleozoic, is, one, of, the, major, divisions, in, geological, time, representing, the, divide, between, the, proterozoic, and, phanerozoic, eons, the, paleozoic, and, neoproterozoic, eras, and, the, ediacaran, and, cambrian, periods, when, adam, sedgwick, named, the, paleozoic, in, 1835, he, defined, the, base, as, the, first, appearance, of, complex, life, in, the, rock, record, as, shown, by, the, presence, of, trilobite, dominated, fauna, since, then, evidence, of, complex, life, in, older, rock, sequences, has, increased, and, by, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, appearance, of, small, shelly, fauna, ssf, also, known, as, early, skeletal, fossils, were, considered, markers, for, the, base, of, the, paleozoic, however, whilst, ssf, are, well, preserved, in, carbonate, sediments, the, majority, of, ediacaran, to, cambrian, rock, sequences, are, composed, of, siliciclastic, rocks, where, skeletal, fossils, are, rarely, preserved, this, led, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, to, use, trace, fossils, as, an, indicator, of, complex, life, unlike, later, in, the, fossil, record, cambrian, trace, fossils, are, preserved, in, a, wide, range, of, sediments, and, environments, which, aids, correlation, between, different, sites, around, the, world, trace, fossils, reflect, the, complexity, of, the, body, plan, of, the, organism, that, made, them, ediacaran, trace, fossils, are, simple, sub, horizontal, feeding, traces, as, more, complex, organisms, evolved, their, more, complex, behaviour, was, reflected, in, greater, diversity, and, complexity, of, the, trace, fossils, they, left, behind, after, two, decades, of, deliberation, the, ics, chose, fortune, head, burin, peninsula, newfoundland, as, the, basal, cambrian, global, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, at, the, base, of, the, treptichnus, pedum, assemblage, of, trace, fossils, and, immediately, above, the, last, occurrence, of, the, ediacaran, problematica, fossils, harlaniella, podolica, and, palaeopsacichnus, the, base, of, the, phanerozoic, paleozoic, and, cambrian, is, dated, at, 538, 8, 0, 2, ma, and, now, lies, below, both, the, first, appearance, of, trilobites, and, ssf, the, boundary, between, the, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, eras, and, the, permian, and, triassic, periods, is, marked, by, the, first, occurrence, of, the, conodont, hindeodus, parvus, this, is, the, first, biostratigraphic, event, found, worldwide, that, is, associated, with, the, beginning, of, the, recovery, following, the, end, permian, mass, extinctions, and, environmental, changes, in, non, marine, strata, the, equivalent, level, is, marked, by, the, disappearance, of, the, permian, dicynodon, tetrapods, this, means, events, previously, considered, to, mark, the, permian, triassic, boundary, such, as, the, eruption, of, the, siberian, traps, flood, basalts, the, onset, of, greenhouse, climate, ocean, anoxia, and, acidification, and, the, resulting, mass, extinction, are, now, regarded, as, being, of, latest, permian, in, age, the, gssp, is, near, meishan, zhejiang, province, southern, china, radiometric, dating, of, volcanic, clay, layers, just, above, and, below, the, boundary, confine, its, age, to, a, narrow, range, of, 251, 902, 0, 024, ma, the, beginning, of, the, paleozoic, era, witnessed, the, breakup, of, the, supercontinent, of, pannotia, and, ended, while, the, supercontinent, pangaea, was, assembling, the, breakup, of, pannotia, began, with, the, opening, of, the, iapetus, ocean, and, other, cambrian, seas, and, coincided, with, a, dramatic, rise, in, sea, level, paleoclimatic, studies, and, evidence, of, glaciers, indicate, that, central, africa, was, most, likely, in, the, polar, regions, during, the, early, paleozoic, the, breakup, of, pannotia, was, followed, by, the, assembly, of, the, huge, continent, gondwana, 510, million, years, ago, by, the, mid, paleozoic, the, collision, of, north, america, and, europe, produced, the, acadian, caledonian, uplifts, and, a, subducting, plate, uplifted, eastern, australia, by, the, late, paleozoic, continental, collisions, formed, the, supercontinent, of, pangaea, and, created, great, mountain, chains, including, the, appalachians, caledonides, ural, mountains, and, mountains, of, tasmania, the, cambrian, spanned, from, 539, 485, million, years, ago, and, is, the, first, period, of, the, paleozoic, era, of, the, phanerozoic, the, cambrian, marked, a, boom, in, evolution, in, an, event, known, as, the, cambrian, explosion, in, which, the, largest, number, of, creatures, evolved, in, any, single, period, of, the, history, of, the, earth, creatures, like, algae, evolved, but, the, most, ubiquitous, of, that, period, were, the, armored, arthropods, like, trilobites, almost, all, marine, phyla, evolved, in, this, period, during, this, time, the, supercontinent, pannotia, begins, to, break, up, most, of, which, later, became, the, supercontinent, gondwana, the, ordovician, spanned, from, 485, 444, million, years, ago, the, ordovician, was, a, time, in, earth, s, history, in, which, many, of, the, biological, classes, still, prevalent, today, evolved, such, as, primitive, fish, cephalopods, and, coral, the, most, common, forms, of, life, however, were, trilobites, snails, and, shellfish, the, first, arthropods, went, ashore, to, colonize, the, empty, continent, of, gondwana, by, the, end, of, the, ordovician, gondwana, was, at, the, south, pole, early, north, america, had, collided, with, europe, closing, the, intervening, ocean, glaciation, of, africa, resulted, in, a, major, drop, in, sea, level, killing, off, all, life, that, had, established, along, coastal, gondwana, glaciation, may, have, caused, the, ordovician, silurian, extinction, events, in, which, 60, of, marine, invertebrates, and, 25, of, families, became, extinct, and, is, considered, the, first, phanerozoic, mass, extinction, event, and, the, second, deadliest, the, silurian, spanned, from, 444, 419, million, years, ago, the, silurian, saw, the, rejuvenation, of, life, as, the, earth, recovered, from, the, previous, glaciation, this, period, saw, the, mass, evolution, of, fish, as, jawless, fish, became, more, numerous, jawed, fish, evolved, and, the, first, freshwater, fish, evolved, though, arthropods, such, as, sea, scorpions, were, still, apex, predators, fully, terrestrial, life, evolved, including, early, arachnids, fungi, and, centipedes, the, evolution, of, vascular, plants, cooksonia, allowed, plants, to, gain, a, foothold, on, land, these, early, plants, were, the, forerunners, of, all, plant, life, on, land, during, this, time, there, were, four, continents, gondwana, africa, south, america, australia, antarctica, siberia, laurentia, north, america, baltica, northern, europe, and, avalonia, western, europe, the, recent, rise, in, sea, levels, allowed, many, new, species, to, thrive, in, water, the, devonian, spanned, from, 419, 359, million, years, ago, also, known, as, the, age, of, the, fish, the, devonian, featured, a, huge, diversification, of, fish, including, armored, fish, like, dunkleosteus, and, lobe, finned, fish, which, eventually, evolved, into, the, first, tetrapods, on, land, plant, groups, diversified, rapidly, in, an, event, known, as, the, devonian, explosion, when, plants, made, lignin, leading, to, taller, growth, and, vascular, tissue, the, first, trees, and, seeds, evolved, these, new, habitats, led, to, greater, arthropod, diversification, the, first, amphibians, appeared, and, fish, occupied, the, top, of, the, food, chain, earth, s, second, phanerozoic, mass, extinction, event, a, group, of, several, smaller, extinction, events, the, late, devonian, extinction, ended, 70, of, existing, species, the, carboniferous, is, named, after, the, large, coal, deposits, laid, down, during, the, period, it, spanned, from, 359, 299, million, years, ago, during, this, time, average, global, temperatures, were, exceedingly, high, the, early, carboniferous, averaged, at, about, 20, degrees, celsius, but, cooled, to, 10, c, during, the, middle, carboniferous, an, important, evolutionary, development, of, the, time, was, the, evolution, of, amniotic, eggs, which, allowed, amphibians, to, move, farther, inland, and, remain, the, dominant, vertebrates, for, the, duration, of, this, period, also, the, first, reptiles, and, synapsids, evolved, in, the, swamps, throughout, the, carboniferous, there, was, a, cooling, trend, which, led, to, the, permo, carboniferous, glaciation, or, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, gondwana, was, glaciated, as, much, of, it, was, situated, around, the, south, pole, the, permian, spanned, from, 299, 252, million, years, ago, and, was, the, last, period, of, the, paleozoic, era, at, the, beginning, of, this, period, all, continents, joined, together, to, form, the, supercontinent, pangaea, which, was, encircled, by, one, ocean, called, panthalassa, the, land, mass, was, very, dry, during, this, time, with, harsh, seasons, as, the, climate, of, the, interior, of, pangaea, was, not, regulated, by, large, bodies, of, water, diapsids, and, synapsids, flourished, in, the, new, dry, climate, creatures, such, as, dimetrodon, and, edaphosaurus, ruled, the, new, continent, the, first, conifers, evolved, and, dominated, the, terrestrial, landscape, near, the, end, of, the, permian, however, pangaea, grew, drier, the, interior, was, desert, and, new, taxa, such, as, scutosaurus, and, gorgonopsids, filled, it, eventually, they, disappeared, along, with, 95, of, all, life, on, earth, in, a, cataclysm, known, as, the, great, dying, the, third, and, most, severe, phanerozoic, mass, extinction, the, early, cambrian, climate, was, probably, moderate, at, first, becoming, warmer, over, the, course, of, the, cambrian, as, the, second, greatest, sustained, sea, level, rise, in, the, phanerozoic, got, underway, however, as, if, to, offset, this, trend, gondwana, moved, south, so, that, in, ordovician, time, most, of, west, gondwana, africa, and, south, america, lay, directly, over, the, south, pole, the, early, paleozoic, climate, was, strongly, zonal, with, the, result, that, the, climate, in, an, abstract, sense, became, warmer, but, the, living, space, of, most, organisms, of, the, time, the, continental, shelf, marine, environment, became, steadily, colder, however, baltica, northern, europe, and, russia, and, laurentia, eastern, north, america, and, greenland, remained, in, the, tropical, zone, while, china, and, australia, lay, in, waters, which, were, at, least, temperate, the, early, paleozoic, ended, rather, abruptly, with, the, short, but, apparently, severe, late, ordovician, ice, age, this, cold, spell, caused, the, second, greatest, mass, extinction, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, over, time, the, warmer, weather, moved, into, the, paleozoic, era, the, ordovician, and, silurian, were, warm, greenhouse, periods, with, the, highest, sea, levels, of, the, paleozoic, 200, m, above, today, s, the, warm, climate, was, interrupted, only, by, a, 30, million, year, cool, period, the, early, palaeozoic, icehouse, culminating, in, the, hirnantian, glaciation, 445, million, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, ordovician, the, middle, paleozoic, was, a, time, of, considerable, stability, sea, levels, had, dropped, coincident, with, the, ice, age, but, slowly, recovered, over, the, course, of, the, silurian, and, devonian, the, slow, merger, of, baltica, and, laurentia, and, the, northward, movement, of, bits, and, pieces, of, gondwana, created, numerous, new, regions, of, relatively, warm, shallow, sea, floor, as, plants, took, hold, on, the, continental, margins, oxygen, levels, increased, and, carbon, dioxide, dropped, although, much, less, dramatically, the, north, south, temperature, gradient, also, seems, to, have, moderated, or, metazoan, life, simply, became, hardier, or, both, at, any, event, the, far, southern, continental, margins, of, antarctica, and, west, gondwana, became, increasingly, less, barren, the, devonian, ended, with, a, series, of, turnover, pulses, which, killed, off, much, of, middle, paleozoic, vertebrate, life, without, noticeably, reducing, species, diversity, overall, there, are, many, unanswered, questions, about, the, late, paleozoic, the, mississippian, early, carboniferous, period, began, with, a, spike, in, atmospheric, oxygen, while, carbon, dioxide, plummeted, to, new, lows, this, destabilized, the, climate, and, led, to, one, and, perhaps, two, ice, ages, during, the, carboniferous, these, were, far, more, severe, than, the, brief, late, ordovician, ice, age, but, this, time, the, effects, on, world, biota, were, inconsequential, by, the, cisuralian, epoch, both, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, had, recovered, to, more, normal, levels, on, the, other, hand, the, assembly, of, pangaea, created, huge, arid, inland, areas, subject, to, temperature, extremes, the, lopingian, epoch, is, associated, with, falling, sea, levels, increased, carbon, dioxide, and, general, climatic, deterioration, culminating, in, the, devastation, of, the, permian, extinction, while, macroscopic, plant, life, appeared, early, in, the, paleozoic, era, and, possibly, late, in, the, neoproterozoic, era, of, the, earlier, eon, plants, mostly, remained, aquatic, until, the, silurian, period, about, 420, million, years, ago, when, they, began, to, transition, onto, dry, land, terrestrial, flora, reached, its, climax, in, the, carboniferous, when, towering, lycopsid, rainforests, dominated, the, tropical, belt, of, euramerica, climate, change, caused, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, which, fragmented, this, habitat, diminishing, the, diversity, of, plant, life, in, the, late, carboniferous, and, permian, periods, a, noteworthy, feature, of, paleozoic, life, is, the, sudden, appearance, of, nearly, all, of, the, invertebrate, animal, phyla, in, great, abundance, at, the, beginning, of, the, cambrian, the, first, vertebrates, appeared, in, the, form, of, primitive, fish, which, greatly, diversified, in, the, silurian, and, devonian, periods, the, first, animals, to, venture, onto, dry, land, were, the, arthropods, some, fish, had, lungs, and, powerful, bony, fins, that, in, the, late, devonian, 367, 5, million, years, ago, allowed, them, to, crawl, onto, land, the, bones, in, their, fins, eventually, evolved, into, legs, and, they, became, the, first, tetrapods, 390, million, years, ago, and, began, to, develop, lungs, amphibians, were, the, dominant, tetrapods, until, the, mid, carboniferous, when, climate, change, greatly, reduced, their, diversity, later, reptiles, prospered, and, continued, to, increase, in, number, and, variety, by, the, late, permian, period, the, palaeozoic, marine, fauna, was, notably, lacking, in, predators, relative, to, the, present, day, predators, made, up, about, 4, of, the, fauna, in, palaeozoic, assemblages, while, making, up, 17, of, temperate, cenozoic, assemblages, and, 31, of, tropical, ones, infaunal, animals, made, up, 4, of, soft, substrate, palaeozoic, communities, but, about, 47, of, cenozoic, communities, additionally, the, palaeozoic, had, very, few, facultatively, motile, animals, that, could, easily, adjust, to, disturbance, with, such, creatures, composing, 1, of, its, assemblages, in, contrast, to, 50, in, cenozoic, faunal, assemblages, non, motile, animals, untethered, to, the, substrate, extremely, rare, in, the, cenozoic, were, abundant, in, the, palaeozoic, palaeozoic, phytoplankton, overall, were, both, nutrient, poor, themselves, and, adapted, to, nutrient, poor, environmental, conditions, this, phytoplankton, nutrient, poverty, has, been, cited, as, an, explanation, for, the, palaeozoic, s, relatively, low, biodiversity
