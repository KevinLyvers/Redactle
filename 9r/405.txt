neodymium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, nd, and, atomic, number, 60, it, is, the, fourth, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, and, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, rare, earth, metals, it, is, a, hard, slightly, malleable, silvery, metal, that, quickly, tarnishes, in, air, and, moisture, when, oxidized, neodymium, reacts, quickly, producing, pink, purple, blue, and, yellow, compounds, in, the, 2, 3, and, 4, oxidation, states, it, is, generally, regarded, as, having, one, of, the, most, complex, spectra, of, the, elements, neodymium, was, discovered, in, 1885, by, the, austrian, chemist, carl, auer, von, welsbach, who, also, discovered, praseodymium, it, is, present, in, significant, quantities, in, the, minerals, monazite, and, bastn, site, neodymium, is, not, found, naturally, in, metallic, form, or, unmixed, with, other, lanthanides, and, it, is, usually, refined, for, general, use, neodymium, is, fairly, common, about, as, common, as, cobalt, nickel, or, copper, and, is, widely, distributed, in, the, earth, s, crust, most, of, the, world, s, commercial, neodymium, is, mined, in, china, as, is, the, case, with, many, other, rare, earth, metals, neodymium, compounds, were, first, commercially, used, as, glass, dyes, in, 1927, and, remain, a, popular, additive, the, color, of, neodymium, compounds, comes, from, the, nd, 3, ion, and, is, often, a, reddish, purple, this, color, changes, with, the, type, of, lighting, because, of, the, interaction, of, the, sharp, light, absorption, bands, of, neodymium, with, ambient, light, enriched, with, the, sharp, visible, emission, bands, of, mercury, trivalent, europium, or, terbium, glasses, that, have, been, doped, with, neodymium, are, used, in, lasers, that, emit, infrared, with, wavelengths, between, 1047, and, 1062, nanometers, these, lasers, have, been, used, in, extremely, high, power, applications, such, as, in, inertial, confinement, fusion, neodymium, is, also, used, with, various, other, substrate, crystals, such, as, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, in, the, nd, yag, laser, neodymium, alloys, are, used, to, make, high, strength, neodymium, magnets, which, are, powerful, permanent, magnets, these, magnets, are, widely, used, in, products, like, microphones, professional, loudspeakers, in, ear, headphones, high, performance, hobby, dc, electric, motors, and, computer, hard, disks, where, low, magnet, mass, or, volume, or, strong, magnetic, fields, are, required, larger, neodymium, magnets, are, used, in, electric, motors, with, a, high, power, to, weight, ratio, e, g, in, hybrid, cars, and, generators, e, g, aircraft, and, wind, turbine, electric, generators, metallic, neodymium, has, a, bright, silvery, metallic, luster, neodymium, commonly, exists, in, two, allotropic, forms, with, a, transformation, from, a, double, hexagonal, to, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, taking, place, at, about, 863, c, neodymium, like, most, of, the, lanthanides, is, paramagnetic, at, room, temperature, it, becomes, an, antiferromagnet, upon, cooling, below, 20, k, 253, 2, c, below, this, transition, temperature, it, exhibits, a, set, of, complex, magnetic, phases, that, have, long, spin, relaxation, times, and, spin, glass, behavior, neodymium, is, a, rare, earth, metal, that, was, present, in, the, classical, mischmetal, at, a, concentration, of, about, 18, to, make, neodymium, magnets, it, is, alloyed, with, iron, which, is, a, ferromagnet, neodymium, is, the, fourth, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, in, the, periodic, table, it, appears, between, the, lanthanides, praseodymium, to, its, left, and, the, radioactive, element, promethium, to, its, right, and, above, the, actinide, uranium, its, 60, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4f, 4, 6s, 2, of, which, the, six, 4f, and, 6s, electrons, are, valence, like, most, other, metals, in, the, lanthanide, series, neodymium, usually, only, uses, three, electrons, as, valence, electrons, as, afterwards, the, remaining, 4f, electrons, are, strongly, bound, this, is, because, the, 4f, orbitals, penetrate, the, most, through, the, inert, xenon, core, of, electrons, to, the, nucleus, followed, by, 5d, and, 6s, and, this, increases, with, higher, ionic, charge, neodymium, can, still, lose, a, fourth, electron, because, it, comes, early, in, the, lanthanides, where, the, nuclear, charge, is, still, low, enough, and, the, 4f, subshell, energy, high, enough, to, allow, the, removal, of, further, valence, electrons, neodymium, has, a, melting, point, of, 1, 024, c, 1, 875, f, and, a, boiling, point, of, 3, 074, c, 5, 565, f, like, other, lanthanides, it, usually, has, the, oxidation, state, 3, but, can, also, form, in, the, 2, and, 4, oxidation, states, and, even, in, very, rare, conditions, 0, neodymium, metal, quickly, oxidizes, at, ambient, conditions, forming, an, oxide, layer, like, iron, rust, that, can, spall, off, and, expose, the, metal, to, further, oxidation, a, centimeter, sized, sample, of, neodymium, corrodes, completely, in, about, a, year, nd, 3, is, generally, soluble, in, water, like, its, neighbor, praseodymium, it, readily, burns, at, about, 150, c, to, form, neodymium, iii, oxide, the, oxide, then, peels, off, exposing, the, bulk, metal, to, the, further, oxidation, neodymium, is, an, electropositive, element, and, it, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, or, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, neodymium, iii, hydroxide, neodymium, metal, reacts, vigorously, with, all, the, stable, halogens, neodymium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, that, contain, the, lilac, nd, iii, ion, these, exist, as, a, 3, complexes, some, of, the, most, important, neodymium, compounds, include, some, neodymium, compounds, vary, in, color, under, different, types, of, lighting, organoneodymium, compounds, are, compounds, that, have, a, neodymium, carbon, bond, these, compounds, are, similar, to, those, of, the, other, lanthanides, characterized, by, an, inability, to, undergo, backbonding, they, are, thus, mostly, restricted, to, the, mostly, ionic, cyclopentadienides, isostructural, with, those, of, lanthanum, and, the, bonded, simple, alkyls, and, aryls, some, of, which, may, be, polymeric, naturally, occurring, neodymium, 60, nd, is, composed, of, five, stable, isotopes, 142, nd, 143, nd, 145, nd, 146, nd, and, 148, nd, with, 142, nd, being, the, most, abundant, 27, 2, of, the, natural, abundance, and, two, radioisotopes, with, extremely, long, half, lives, 144, nd, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, t, 1, 2, of, 2, 29, 10, 15, years, and, 150, nd, double, beta, decay, t, 1, 2, 7, 10, 18, years, in, all, 33, radioisotopes, of, neodymium, have, been, detected, as, of, 2022, with, the, most, stable, radioisotopes, being, the, naturally, occurring, ones, 144, nd, and, 150, nd, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, shorter, than, twelve, days, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, shorter, than, 70, seconds, the, most, stable, artificial, isotope, is, 147, nd, with, a, half, life, of, 10, 98, days, neodymium, also, has, 13, known, metastable, isotopes, with, the, most, stable, one, being, 139m, nd, t, 1, 2, 5, 5, hours, 135m, nd, t, 1, 2, 5, 5, minutes, and, 133m1, nd, t, 1, 2, 70, seconds, the, primary, decay, modes, before, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 142, nd, are, electron, capture, and, positron, decay, and, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, minus, decay, the, primary, decay, products, before, 142, nd, are, element, pr, praseodymium, isotopes, and, the, primary, products, after, 142, nd, are, element, pm, promethium, isotopes, four, of, the, five, stable, isotopes, are, only, observationally, stable, which, means, that, they, are, expected, to, undergo, radioactive, decay, additionally, some, observationally, stable, isotopes, of, samarium, are, predicted, to, decay, to, isotopes, of, neodymium, neodymium, isotopes, are, used, in, various, scientific, applications, 142, nd, has, been, used, for, the, production, of, short, lived, tm, and, yb, isotopes, 146, nd, has, been, suggested, for, the, production, of, 147, pm, which, is, a, source, of, radioactive, power, several, neodymium, isotopes, have, been, used, for, the, production, of, other, promethium, isotopes, the, decay, from, 147, sm, t, 1, 2, 1, 06, 10, 11, y, to, the, stable, 143, nd, allows, for, samarium, neodymium, dating, 150, nd, has, also, been, used, to, study, double, beta, decay, in, 1751, the, swedish, mineralogist, axel, fredrik, cronstedt, discovered, a, heavy, mineral, from, the, mine, at, bastn, s, later, named, cerite, thirty, years, later, fifteen, year, old, wilhelm, hisinger, a, member, of, the, family, owning, the, mine, sent, a, sample, to, carl, scheele, who, did, not, find, any, new, elements, within, in, 1803, after, hisinger, had, become, an, ironmaster, he, returned, to, the, mineral, with, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, and, isolated, a, new, oxide, which, they, named, ceria, after, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, which, had, been, discovered, two, years, earlier, ceria, was, simultaneously, and, independently, isolated, in, germany, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, between, 1839, and, 1843, ceria, was, shown, to, be, a, mixture, of, oxides, by, the, swedish, surgeon, and, chemist, carl, gustaf, mosander, who, lived, in, the, same, house, as, berzelius, he, separated, out, two, other, oxides, which, he, named, lanthana, and, didymia, he, partially, decomposed, a, sample, of, cerium, nitrate, by, roasting, it, in, air, and, then, treating, the, resulting, oxide, with, dilute, nitric, acid, the, metals, that, formed, these, oxides, were, thus, named, lanthanum, and, didymium, officially, discovered, in, vienna, in, 1885, by, carl, gustaf, mosander, von, welsbach, confirmed, the, separation, by, spectroscopic, analysis, but, the, products, were, of, relatively, low, purity, didymium, was, discovered, by, carl, gustaf, mosander, in, 1841, and, pure, neodymium, was, isolated, from, it, in, 1925, the, name, neodymium, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, neos, new, and, didymos, twin, double, nitrate, crystallization, was, the, means, of, commercial, neodymium, purification, until, the, 1950s, lindsay, chemical, division, was, the, first, to, commercialize, large, scale, ion, exchange, purification, of, neodymium, starting, in, the, 1950s, high, purity, 99, neodymium, was, primarily, obtained, through, an, ion, exchange, process, from, monazite, a, mineral, rich, in, rare, earth, elements, the, metal, is, obtained, through, electrolysis, of, its, halide, salts, currently, most, neodymium, is, extracted, from, bastn, site, and, purified, by, solvent, extraction, ion, exchange, purification, is, used, for, the, highest, purities, typically, 99, 99, since, then, the, glass, technology, has, improved, due, to, the, improved, purity, of, commercially, available, neodymium, oxide, and, the, advancement, of, glass, technology, in, general, early, methods, of, separating, the, lanthanides, depended, on, fractional, crystallization, which, did, not, allow, for, the, isolation, of, high, purity, neodymium, until, the, aforementioned, ion, exchange, methods, were, developed, after, world, war, ii, neodymium, is, rarely, found, in, nature, as, a, free, element, instead, occurring, in, ores, such, as, monazite, and, bastn, site, which, are, mineral, groups, rather, than, single, minerals, that, contain, small, amounts, of, all, rare, earth, elements, neodymium, is, rarely, dominant, in, these, minerals, with, exceptions, such, as, monazite, nd, and, kozoite, nd, the, main, mining, areas, are, in, china, united, states, brazil, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, the, nd, 3, ion, is, similar, in, size, to, ions, of, the, early, lanthanides, of, the, cerium, group, those, from, lanthanum, to, samarium, and, europium, as, a, result, it, tends, to, occur, along, with, them, in, phosphate, silicate, and, carbonate, minerals, such, as, monazite, m, iii, po, 4, and, bastn, site, m, iii, co, 3, f, where, m, refers, to, all, the, rare, earth, metals, except, scandium, and, the, radioactive, promethium, mostly, ce, la, and, y, with, somewhat, less, pr, and, nd, bastn, site, is, usually, lacking, in, thorium, and, the, heavy, lanthanides, and, the, purification, of, the, light, lanthanides, from, it, is, less, involved, than, from, monazite, the, ore, after, being, crushed, and, ground, is, first, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, which, liberates, carbon, dioxide, hydrogen, fluoride, and, silicon, tetrafluoride, the, product, is, then, dried, and, leached, with, water, leaving, the, early, lanthanide, ions, including, lanthanum, in, solution, neodymium, s, per, particle, abundance, in, the, solar, system, is, 0, 083, ppb, parts, per, billion, this, figure, is, about, two, thirds, of, that, of, platinum, but, two, and, a, half, times, more, than, mercury, and, nearly, five, times, more, than, gold, the, lanthanides, are, not, usually, found, in, space, and, are, much, more, abundant, in, the, earth, s, crust, neodymium, is, classified, as, a, lithophile, under, the, goldschmidt, classification, meaning, that, it, is, generally, found, combined, with, oxygen, although, it, belongs, to, the, rare, earth, metals, neodymium, is, not, rare, at, all, its, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, about, 41, mg, kg, it, is, similar, in, abundance, to, lanthanum, the, world, s, production, of, neodymium, was, about, 7, 000, tons, in, 2004, the, bulk, of, current, production, is, from, china, historically, the, chinese, government, imposed, strategic, material, controls, on, the, element, causing, large, fluctuations, in, prices, the, uncertainty, of, pricing, and, availability, have, caused, companies, particularly, japanese, ones, to, create, permanent, magnets, and, associated, electric, motors, with, fewer, rare, earth, metals, however, so, far, they, have, been, unable, to, eliminate, the, need, for, neodymium, according, to, the, us, geological, survey, greenland, holds, the, largest, reserves, of, undeveloped, rare, earth, deposits, particularly, neodymium, mining, interests, clash, with, native, populations, at, those, sites, due, to, the, release, of, radioactive, substances, mainly, thorium, during, the, mining, process, neodymium, is, typically, 10, 18, of, the, rare, earth, content, of, commercial, deposits, of, the, light, rare, earth, element, minerals, bastn, site, and, monazite, with, neodymium, compounds, being, the, most, strongly, colored, for, the, trivalent, lanthanides, it, can, occasionally, dominate, the, coloration, of, rare, earth, minerals, when, competing, chromophores, are, absent, it, usually, gives, a, pink, coloration, outstanding, examples, of, this, include, monazite, crystals, from, the, tin, deposits, in, llallagua, bolivia, ancylite, from, mont, saint, hilaire, quebec, canada, or, lanthanite, from, lower, saucon, township, pennsylvania, as, with, neodymium, glasses, such, minerals, change, their, colors, under, the, differing, lighting, conditions, the, absorption, bands, of, neodymium, interact, with, the, visible, emission, spectrum, of, mercury, vapor, with, the, unfiltered, shortwave, uv, light, causing, neodymium, containing, minerals, to, reflect, a, distinctive, green, color, this, can, be, observed, with, monazite, containing, sands, or, bastn, site, containing, ore, the, demand, for, mineral, resources, such, as, rare, earth, elements, including, neodymium, and, other, critical, materials, has, been, rapidly, increasing, owing, to, the, growing, human, population, and, industrial, development, recently, the, requirement, for, a, low, carbon, society, has, led, to, a, significant, demand, for, energy, saving, technologies, such, as, batteries, high, efficiency, motors, renewable, energy, sources, and, fuel, cells, among, these, technologies, permanent, magnets, are, often, used, to, fabricate, high, efficiency, motors, with, neodymium, iron, boron, magnets, nd, 2, fe, 14, b, sintered, and, bonded, magnets, hereinafter, referred, to, as, ndfeb, magnets, being, the, main, type, of, permanent, magnet, in, the, market, since, their, invention, ndfeb, magnets, are, used, in, hybrid, electric, vehicles, plug, in, hybrid, electric, vehicles, electric, vehicles, fuel, cell, vehicles, wind, turbines, home, appliances, computers, and, many, small, consumer, electronic, devices, furthermore, they, are, indispensable, for, energy, savings, toward, achieving, the, objectives, of, the, paris, agreement, the, demand, for, ndfeb, magnets, is, expected, to, increase, significantly, in, the, future, neodymium, magnets, an, alloy, nd, 2, fe, 14, b, are, the, strongest, permanent, magnets, known, a, neodymium, magnet, of, a, few, tens, of, grams, can, lift, a, thousand, times, its, own, weight, and, can, snap, together, with, enough, force, to, break, bones, these, magnets, are, cheaper, lighter, and, stronger, than, samarium, cobalt, magnets, however, they, are, not, superior, in, every, aspect, as, neodymium, based, magnets, lose, their, magnetism, at, lower, temperatures, and, tend, to, corrode, while, samarium, cobalt, magnets, do, not, neodymium, magnets, appear, in, products, such, as, microphones, professional, loudspeakers, headphones, guitar, and, bass, guitar, pick, ups, and, computer, hard, disks, where, low, mass, small, volume, or, strong, magnetic, fields, are, required, neodymium, is, used, in, the, electric, motors, of, hybrid, and, electric, automobiles, and, in, the, electricity, generators, of, some, designs, of, commercial, wind, turbines, only, wind, turbines, with, permanent, magnet, generators, use, neodymium, for, example, drive, electric, motors, of, each, toyota, prius, require, one, kilogram, 2, 2, pounds, of, neodymium, per, vehicle, neodymium, glass, nd, glass, is, produced, by, the, inclusion, of, neodymium, oxide, nd, 2, o, 3, in, the, glass, melt, in, daylight, or, incandescent, light, neodymium, glass, appears, lavender, but, it, appears, pale, blue, under, fluorescent, lighting, neodymium, may, be, used, to, color, glass, in, shades, ranging, from, pure, violet, through, wine, red, and, warm, gray, the, first, commercial, use, of, purified, neodymium, was, in, glass, coloration, starting, with, experiments, by, leo, moser, in, november, 1927, the, resulting, alexandrite, glass, remains, a, signature, color, of, the, moser, glassworks, to, this, day, neodymium, glass, was, widely, emulated, in, the, early, 1930s, by, american, glasshouses, most, notably, heisey, fostoria, wisteria, cambridge, heatherbloom, and, steuben, wisteria, and, elsewhere, e, g, lalique, in, france, or, murano, tiffin, s, twilight, remained, in, production, from, about, 1950, to, 1980, current, sources, include, glassmakers, in, the, czech, republic, the, united, states, and, china, the, sharp, absorption, bands, of, neodymium, cause, the, glass, color, to, change, under, different, lighting, conditions, being, reddish, purple, under, daylight, or, yellow, incandescent, light, blue, under, white, fluorescent, lighting, and, greenish, under, trichromatic, lighting, in, combination, with, gold, or, selenium, red, colors, are, produced, since, neodymium, coloration, depends, upon, forbidden, f, f, transitions, deep, within, the, atom, there, is, relatively, little, influence, on, the, color, from, the, chemical, environment, so, the, color, is, impervious, to, the, thermal, history, of, the, glass, however, for, the, best, color, iron, containing, impurities, need, to, be, minimized, in, the, silica, used, to, make, the, glass, the, same, forbidden, nature, of, the, f, f, transitions, makes, rare, earth, colorants, less, intense, than, those, provided, by, most, d, transition, elements, so, more, has, to, be, used, in, a, glass, to, achieve, the, desired, color, intensity, the, original, moser, recipe, used, about, 5, of, neodymium, oxide, in, the, glass, melt, a, sufficient, quantity, such, that, moser, referred, to, these, as, being, rare, earth, doped, glasses, being, a, strong, base, that, level, of, neodymium, would, have, affected, the, melting, properties, of, the, glass, and, the, lime, content, of, the, glass, might, have, needed, adjustments, light, transmitted, through, neodymium, glasses, shows, unusually, sharp, absorption, bands, the, glass, is, used, in, astronomical, work, to, produce, sharp, bands, by, which, spectral, lines, may, be, calibrated, another, application, is, the, creation, of, selective, astronomical, filters, to, reduce, the, effect, of, light, pollution, from, sodium, and, fluorescent, lighting, while, passing, other, colours, especially, dark, red, hydrogen, alpha, emission, from, nebulae, neodymium, is, also, used, to, remove, the, green, color, caused, by, iron, contaminants, from, glass, neodymium, is, a, component, of, didymium, referring, to, mixture, of, salts, of, neodymium, and, praseodymium, used, for, coloring, glass, to, make, welder, s, and, glass, blower, s, goggles, the, sharp, absorption, bands, obliterate, the, strong, sodium, emission, at, 589, nm, the, similar, absorption, of, the, yellow, mercury, emission, line, at, 578, nm, is, the, principal, cause, of, the, blue, color, observed, for, neodymium, glass, under, traditional, white, fluorescent, lighting, neodymium, and, didymium, glass, are, used, in, color, enhancing, filters, in, indoor, photography, particularly, in, filtering, out, the, yellow, hues, from, incandescent, lighting, similarly, neodymium, glass, is, becoming, widely, used, more, directly, in, incandescent, light, bulbs, these,

as, well, as, lanthanum, cerium, and, praseodymium, have, been, found, to, be, essential, to, some, methanotrophic, bacteria, living, in, volcanic, mudpots, such, as, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, neodymium, is, not, otherwise, known, to, have, a, biological, role, in, any, other, organisms, neodymium, metal, dust, is, combustible, and, therefore, an, explosion, hazard, neodymium, compounds, as, with, all, rare, earth, metals, are, of, low, to, moderate, toxicity, however, its, toxicity, has, not, been, thoroughly, investigated, ingested, neodymium, salts, are, regarded, as, more, toxic, if, they, are, soluble, than, if, they, are, insoluble, neodymium, dust, and, salts, are, very, irritating, to, the, eyes, and, mucous, membranes, and, moderately, irritating, to, skin, breathing, the, dust, can, cause, lung, embolisms, and, accumulated, exposure, damages, the, liver, neodymium, also, acts, as, an, anticoagulant, especially, when, given, intravenously, neodymium, magnets, have, been, tested, for, medical, uses, such, as, magnetic, braces, and, bone, repair, but, biocompatibility, issues, have, prevented, widespread, applications, commercially, available, magnets, made, from, neodymium, are, exceptionally, strong, and, can, attract, each, other, from, large, distances, if, not, handled, carefully, they, come, together, very, quickly, and, forcefully, causing, injuries, there, is, at, least, one, documented, case, of, a, person, losing, a, fingertip, when, two, magnets, he, was, using, snapped, together, from, 50, cm, away, another, risk, of, these, powerful, magnets, is, that, if, more, than, one, magnet, is, ingested, they, can, pinch, soft, tissues, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, this, has, led, to, an, estimated, 1, 700, emergency, room, visits, and, necessitated, the, recall, of, the, buckyballs, line, of, toys, which, were, construction, sets, of, small, neodymium, magnets
