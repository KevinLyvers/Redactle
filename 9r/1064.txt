in, physics, the, special, theory, of, relativity, or, special, relativity, for, short, is, a, scientific, theory, of, the, relationship, between, space, and, time, in, albert, einstein, s, 1905, paper, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, the, theory, is, presented, as, being, based, on, just, two, postulates, the, first, postulate, was, first, formulated, by, galileo, galilei, see, galilean, invariance, special, relativity, was, described, by, albert, einstein, in, a, paper, published, on, 26, september, 1905, titled, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, appeared, to, be, incompatible, with, newtonian, mechanics, and, the, michelson, morley, experiment, failed, to, detect, the, earth, s, motion, against, the, hypothesized, luminiferous, aether, these, led, to, the, development, of, the, lorentz, transformations, by, hendrik, lorentz, which, adjust, distances, and, times, for, moving, objects, special, relativity, corrects, the, hitherto, laws, of, mechanics, to, handle, situations, involving, all, motions, and, especially, those, at, a, speed, close, to, that, of, light, known, as, relativistic, velocities, today, special, relativity, is, proven, to, be, the, most, accurate, model, of, motion, at, any, speed, when, gravitational, and, quantum, effects, are, negligible, even, so, the, newtonian, model, is, still, valid, as, a, simple, and, accurate, approximation, at, low, velocities, relative, to, the, speed, of, light, for, example, everyday, motions, on, earth, special, relativity, has, a, wide, range, of, consequences, that, have, been, experimentally, verified, they, include, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, length, contraction, time, dilation, the, relativistic, velocity, addition, formula, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, relativistic, mass, a, universal, speed, limit, mass, energy, equivalence, the, speed, of, causality, and, the, thomas, precession, it, has, for, example, replaced, the, conventional, notion, of, an, absolute, universal, time, with, the, notion, of, a, time, that, is, dependent, on, reference, frame, and, spatial, position, rather, than, an, invariant, time, interval, between, two, events, there, is, an, invariant, spacetime, interval, combined, with, other, laws, of, physics, the, two, postulates, of, special, relativity, predict, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, as, expressed, in, the, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, e, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, mc, 2, where, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, in, a, vacuum, it, also, explains, how, the, phenomena, of, electricity, and, magnetism, are, related, a, defining, feature, of, special, relativity, is, the, replacement, of, the, galilean, transformations, of, newtonian, mechanics, with, the, lorentz, transformations, time, and, space, cannot, be, defined, separately, from, each, other, as, was, previously, thought, to, be, the, case, rather, space, and, time, are, interwoven, into, a, single, continuum, known, as, spacetime, events, that, occur, at, the, same, time, for, one, observer, can, occur, at, different, times, for, another, until, several, years, later, when, einstein, developed, general, relativity, which, introduced, a, curved, spacetime, to, incorporate, gravity, the, phrase, special, relativity, was, not, used, a, translation, sometimes, used, is, restricted, relativity, special, really, means, special, case, some, of, the, work, of, albert, einstein, in, special, relativity, is, built, on, the, earlier, work, by, hendrik, lorentz, and, henri, poincar, the, theory, became, essentially, complete, in, 1907, with, hermann, minkowski, s, papers, on, spacetime, the, theory, is, special, in, that, it, only, applies, in, the, special, case, where, the, spacetime, is, flat, that, is, where, the, curvature, of, spacetime, a, consequence, of, the, energy, momentum, tensor, and, representing, gravity, is, negligible, to, correctly, accommodate, gravity, einstein, formulated, general, relativity, in, 1915, special, relativity, contrary, to, some, historical, descriptions, does, accommodate, accelerations, as, well, as, accelerating, frames, of, reference, just, as, galilean, relativity, is, now, accepted, to, be, an, approximation, of, special, relativity, that, is, valid, for, low, speeds, special, relativity, is, considered, an, approximation, of, general, relativity, that, is, valid, for, weak, gravitational, fields, that, is, at, a, sufficiently, small, scale, e, g, when, tidal, forces, are, negligible, and, in, conditions, of, free, fall, but, general, relativity, incorporates, non, euclidean, geometry, to, represent, gravitational, effects, as, the, geometric, curvature, of, spacetime, special, relativity, is, restricted, to, the, flat, spacetime, known, as, minkowski, space, as, long, as, the, universe, can, be, modeled, as, a, pseudo, riemannian, manifold, a, lorentz, invariant, frame, that, abides, by, special, relativity, can, be, defined, for, a, sufficiently, small, neighborhood, of, each, point, in, this, curved, spacetime, galileo, galilei, had, already, postulated, that, there, is, no, absolute, and, well, defined, state, of, rest, no, privileged, reference, frames, a, principle, now, called, galileo, s, principle, of, relativity, einstein, extended, this, principle, so, that, it, accounted, for, the, constant, speed, of, light, a, phenomenon, that, had, been, observed, in, the, michelson, morley, experiment, he, also, postulated, that, it, holds, for, all, the, laws, of, physics, including, both, the, laws, of, mechanics, and, of, electrodynamics, reflections, of, this, type, made, it, clear, to, me, as, long, ago, as, shortly, after, 1900, i, e, shortly, after, planck, s, trailblazing, work, that, neither, mechanics, nor, electrodynamics, could, except, in, limiting, cases, claim, exact, validity, gradually, i, despaired, of, the, possibility, of, discovering, the, true, laws, by, means, of, constructive, efforts, based, on, known, facts, the, longer, and, the, more, desperately, i, tried, the, more, i, came, to, the, conviction, that, only, the, discovery, of, a, universal, formal, principle, could, lead, us, to, assured, results, how, then, could, such, a, universal, principle, be, found, albert, einstein, autobiographical, notes, einstein, discerned, two, fundamental, propositions, that, seemed, to, be, the, most, assured, regardless, of, the, exact, validity, of, the, then, known, laws, of, either, mechanics, or, electrodynamics, these, propositions, were, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, and, the, independence, of, physical, laws, especially, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, from, the, choice, of, inertial, system, in, his, initial, presentation, of, special, relativity, in, 1905, he, expressed, these, postulates, as, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, was, motivated, by, maxwell, s, theory, of, electromagnetism, and, the, lack, of, evidence, for, the, luminiferous, ether, there, is, conflicting, evidence, on, the, extent, to, which, einstein, was, influenced, by, the, null, result, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, in, any, case, the, null, result, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, helped, the, notion, of, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, gain, widespread, and, rapid, acceptance, the, derivation, of, special, relativity, depends, not, only, on, these, two, explicit, postulates, but, also, on, several, tacit, assumptions, made, in, almost, all, theories, of, physics, including, the, isotropy, and, homogeneity, of, space, and, the, independence, of, measuring, rods, and, clocks, from, their, past, history, following, einstein, s, original, presentation, of, special, relativity, in, 1905, many, different, sets, of, postulates, have, been, proposed, in, various, alternative, derivations, but, the, most, common, set, of, postulates, remains, those, employed, by, einstein, in, his, original, paper, a, more, mathematical, statement, of, the, principle, of, relativity, made, later, by, einstein, which, introduces, the, concept, of, simplicity, not, mentioned, above, is, special, principle, of, relativity, if, a, system, of, coordinates, k, is, chosen, so, that, in, relation, to, it, physical, laws, hold, good, in, their, simplest, form, the, same, laws, hold, good, in, relation, to, any, other, system, of, coordinates, k, moving, in, uniform, translation, relatively, to, k, henri, poincar, provided, the, mathematical, framework, for, relativity, theory, by, proving, that, lorentz, transformations, are, a, subset, of, his, poincar, group, of, symmetry, transformations, einstein, later, derived, these, transformations, from, his, axioms, many, of, einstein, s, papers, present, derivations, of, the, lorentz, transformation, based, upon, these, two, principles, reference, frames, play, a, crucial, role, in, relativity, theory, the, term, reference, frame, as, used, here, is, an, observational, perspective, in, space, that, is, not, undergoing, any, change, in, motion, acceleration, from, which, a, position, can, be, measured, along, 3, spatial, axes, so, at, rest, or, constant, velocity, in, addition, a, reference, frame, has, the, ability, to, determine, measurements, of, the, time, of, events, using, a, clock, any, reference, device, with, uniform, periodicity, an, event, is, an, occurrence, that, can, be, assigned, a, single, unique, moment, and, location, in, space, relative, to, a, reference, frame, it, is, a, point, in, spacetime, since, the, speed, of, light, is, constant, in, relativity, irrespective, of, the, reference, frame, pulses, of, light, can, be, used, to, unambiguously, measure, distances, and, refer, back, to, the, times, that, events, occurred, to, the, clock, even, though, light, takes, time, to, reach, the, clock, after, the, event, has, transpired, for, example, the, explosion, of, a, firecracker, may, be, considered, to, be, an, event, we, can, completely, specify, an, event, by, its, four, spacetime, coordinates, the, time, of, occurrence, and, its, 3, dimensional, spatial, location, define, a, reference, point, let, s, call, this, reference, frame, s, in, relativity, theory, we, often, want, to, calculate, the, coordinates, of, an, event, from, differing, reference, frames, the, equations, that, relate, measurements, made, in, different, frames, are, called, transformation, equations, to, gain, insight, into, how, the, spacetime, coordinates, measured, by, observers, in, different, reference, frames, compare, with, each, other, it, is, useful, to, work, with, a, simplified, setup, with, frames, in, a, standard, configuration, 107, with, care, this, allows, simplification, of, the, math, with, no, loss, of, generality, in, the, conclusions, that, are, reached, in, fig, 2, 1, two, galilean, reference, frames, i, e, conventional, 3, space, frames, are, displayed, in, relative, motion, frame, s, belongs, to, a, first, observer, o, and, frame, s, pronounced, s, prime, or, s, dash, belongs, to, a, second, observer, o, since, there, is, no, absolute, reference, frame, in, relativity, theory, a, concept, of, moving, does, not, strictly, exist, as, everything, may, be, moving, with, respect, to, some, other, reference, frame, instead, any, two, frames, that, move, at, the, same, speed, in, the, same, direction, are, said, to, be, comoving, therefore, s, and, s, are, not, comoving, the, principle, of, relativity, which, states, that, physical, laws, have, the, same, form, in, each, inertial, reference, frame, dates, back, to, galileo, and, was, incorporated, into, newtonian, physics, but, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, existence, of, electromagnetic, waves, led, some, physicists, to, suggest, that, the, universe, was, filled, with, a, substance, they, called, aether, which, they, postulated, would, act, as, the, medium, through, which, these, waves, or, vibrations, propagated, in, many, respects, similar, to, the, way, sound, propagates, through, air, the, aether, was, thought, to, be, an, absolute, reference, frame, against, which, all, speeds, could, be, measured, and, could, be, considered, fixed, and, motionless, relative, to, earth, or, some, other, fixed, reference, point, the, aether, was, supposed, to, be, sufficiently, elastic, to, support, electromagnetic, waves, while, those, waves, could, interact, with, matter, yet, offering, no, resistance, to, bodies, passing, through, it, its, one, property, was, that, it, allowed, electromagnetic, waves, to, propagate, the, results, of, various, experiments, including, the, michelson, morley, experiment, in, 1887, subsequently, verified, with, more, accurate, and, innovative, experiments, led, to, the, theory, of, special, relativity, by, showing, that, the, aether, did, not, exist, einstein, s, solution, was, to, discard, the, notion, of, an, aether, and, the, absolute, state, of, rest, in, relativity, any, reference, frame, moving, with, uniform, motion, will, observe, the, same, laws, of, physics, in, particular, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, always, measured, to, be, c, even, when, measured, by, multiple, systems, that, are, moving, at, different, but, constant, velocities, from, the, principle, of, relativity, alone, without, assuming, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, i, e, using, the, isotropy, of, space, and, the, symmetry, implied, by, the, principle, of, special, relativity, it, can, be, shown, that, the, spacetime, transformations, between, inertial, frames, are, either, euclidean, galilean, or, lorentzian, in, the, lorentzian, case, one, can, then, obtain, relativistic, interval, conservation, and, a, certain, finite, limiting, speed, experiments, suggest, that, this, speed, is, the, speed, of, light, in, a, vacuum, einstein, consistently, based, the, derivation, of, lorentz, invariance, the, essential, core, of, special, relativity, on, just, the, two, basic, principles, of, relativity, and, light, speed, invariance, he, wrote, the, insight, fundamental, for, the, special, theory, of, relativity, is, this, the, assumptions, relativity, and, light, speed, invariance, are, compatible, if, relations, of, a, new, type, lorentz, transformation, are, postulated, for, the, conversion, of, coordinates, and, times, of, events, the, universal, principle, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, is, contained, in, the, postulate, the, laws, of, physics, are, invariant, with, respect, to, lorentz, transformations, for, the, transition, from, one, inertial, system, to, any, other, arbitrarily, chosen, inertial, system, this, is, a, restricting, principle, for, natural, laws, thus, many, modern, treatments, of, special, relativity, base, it, on, the, single, postulate, of, universal, lorentz, covariance, or, equivalently, on, the, single, postulate, of, minkowski, spacetime, rather, than, considering, universal, lorentz, covariance, to, be, a, derived, principle, this, article, considers, it, to, be, the, fundamental, postulate, of, special, relativity, the, traditional, two, postulate, approach, to, special, relativity, is, presented, in, innumerable, college, textbooks, and, popular, presentations, textbooks, starting, with, the, single, postulate, of, minkowski, spacetime, include, those, by, taylor, and, wheeler, and, by, callahan, this, is, also, the, approach, followed, by, the, wikipedia, articles, spacetime, and, minkowski, diagram, define, an, event, to, have, spacetime, coordinates, t, x, y, z, in, system, s, and, t, x, y, z, in, a, reference, frame, moving, at, a, velocity, v, on, the, x, axis, with, respect, to, that, frame, s, then, the, lorentz, transformation, specifies, that, these, coordinates, are, related, in, the, following, way, t, t, v, x, c, 2, x, x, v, t, y, y, z, z, displaystyle, begin, aligned, t, gamma, t, vx, c, 2, x, gamma, x, vt, y, y, z, z, end, aligned, where, 1, 1, v, 2, c, 2, displaystyle, gamma, frac, 1, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, is, the, lorentz, factor, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, and, the, velocity, v, of, s, relative, to, s, is, parallel, to, the, x, axis, for, simplicity, the, y, and, z, coordinates, are, unaffected, only, the, x, and, t, coordinates, are, transformed, these, lorentz, transformations, form, a, one, parameter, group, of, linear, mappings, that, parameter, being, called, rapidity, solving, the, four, transformation, equations, above, for, the, unprimed, coordinates, yields, the, inverse, lorentz, transformation, t, t, v, x, c, 2, x, x, v, t, y, y, z, z, displaystyle, begin, aligned, t, gamma, t, vx, c, 2, x, gamma, x, vt, y, y, z, z, end, aligned, this, shows, that, the, unprimed, frame, is, moving, with, the, velocity, v, as, measured, in, the, primed, frame, there, is, nothing, special, about, the, x, axis, the, transformation, can, apply, to, the, y, or, z, axis, or, indeed, in, any, direction, parallel, to, the, motion, which, are, warped, by, the, factor, and, perpendicular, see, the, article, lorentz, transformation, for, details, a, quantity, invariant, under, lorentz, transformations, is, known, as, a, lorentz, scalar, writing, the, lorentz, transformation, and, its, inverse, in, terms, of, coordinate, differences, where, one, event, has, coordinates, x, 1, t, 1, and, x, 1, t, 1, another, event, has, coordinates, x, 2, t, 2, and, x, 2, t, 2, and, the, differences, are, defined, as, we, get, if, we, take, differentials, instead, of, taking, differences, we, get, spacetime, diagrams, minkowski, diagrams, are, an, extremely, useful, aid, to, visualizing, how, coordinates, transform, between, different, reference, frames, although, it, is, not, as, easy, to, perform, exact, computations, using, them, as, directly, invoking, the, lorentz, transformations, their, main, power, is, their, ability, to, provide, an, intuitive, grasp, of, the, results, of, a, relativistic, scenario, to, draw, a, spacetime, diagram, begin, by, considering, two, galilean, reference, frames, s, and, s, in, standard, configuration, as, shown, in, fig, 2, 1, 155, 199, fig, 3, 1a, draw, the, x, displaystyle, x, and, t, displaystyle, t, axes, of, frame, s, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, is, horizontal, and, the, t, displaystyle, t, actually, c, t, displaystyle, ct, axis, is, vertical, which, is, the, opposite, of, the, usual, convention, in, kinematics, the, c, t, displaystyle, ct, axis, is, scaled, by, a, factor, of, c, displaystyle, c, so, that, both, axes, have, common, units, of, length, in, the, diagram, shown, the, gridlines, are, spaced, one, unit, distance, apart, the, 45, diagonal, lines, represent, the, worldlines, of, two, photons, passing, through, the, origin, at, time, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, the, slope, of, these, worldlines, is, 1, because, the, photons, advance, one, unit, in, space, per, unit, of, time, two, events, a, displaystyle, text, a, and, b, displaystyle, text, b, have, been, plotted, on, this, graph, so, that, their, coordinates, may, be, compared, in, the, s, and, s, frames, fig, 3, 1b, draw, the, x, displaystyle, x, and, c, t, displaystyle, ct, axes, of, frame, s, the, c, t, displaystyle, ct, axis, represents, the, worldline, of, the, origin, of, the, s, coordinate, system, as, measured, in, frame, s, in, this, figure, v, c, 2, displaystyle, v, c, 2, both, the, c, t, displaystyle, ct, and, x, displaystyle, x, axes, are, tilted, from, the, unprimed, axes, by, an, angle, tan, 1, displaystyle, alpha, tan, 1, beta, where, v, c, displaystyle, beta, v, c, the, primed, and, unprimed, axes, share, a, common, origin, because, frames, s, and, s, had, been, set, up, in, standard, configuration, so, that, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, when, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, fig, 3, 1c, units, in, the, primed, axes, have, a, different, scale, from, units, in, the, unprimed, axes, from, the, lorentz, transformations, we, observe, that, x, c, t, displaystyle, x, ct, coordinates, of, 0, 1, displaystyle, 0, 1, in, the, primed, coordinate, system, transform, to, displaystyle, beta, gamma, gamma, in, the, unprimed, coordinate, system, likewise, x, c, t, displaystyle, x, ct, coordinates, of, 1, 0, displaystyle, 1, 0, in, the, primed, coordinate, system, transform, to, displaystyle, gamma, beta, gamma, in, the, unprimed, system, draw, gridlines, parallel, with, the, c, t, displaystyle, ct, axis, through, points, k, k, displaystyle, k, gamma, k, beta, gamma, as, measured, in, the, unprimed, frame, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, an, integer, likewise, draw, gridlines, parallel, with, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, through, k, k, displaystyle, k, beta, gamma, k, gamma, as, measured, in, the, unprimed, frame, using, the, pythagorean, theorem, we, observe, that, the, spacing, between, c, t, displaystyle, ct, units, equals, 1, 2, 1, 2, textstyle, sqrt, 1, beta, 2, 1, beta, 2, times, the, spacing, between, c, t, displaystyle, ct, units, as, measured, in, frame, s, this, ratio, is, always, greater, than, 1, and, ultimately, it, approaches, infinity, as, 1, displaystyle, beta, to, 1, fig, 3, 1d, since, the, speed, of, light, is, an, invariant, the, worldlines, of, two, photons, passing, through, the, origin, at, time, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, still, plot, as, 45, diagonal, lines, the, primed, coordinates, of, a, displaystyle, text, a, and, b, displaystyle, text, b, are, related, to, the, unprimed, coordinates, through, the, lorentz, transformations, and, could, be, approximately, measured, from, the, graph, assuming, that, it, has, been, plotted, accurately, enough, but, the, real, merit, of, a, minkowski, diagram, is, its, granting, us, a, geometric, view, of, the, scenario, for, example, in, this, figure, we, observe, that, the, two, timelike, separated, events, that, had, different, x, coordinates, in, the, unprimed, frame, are, now, at, the, same, position, in, space, while, the, unprimed, frame, is, drawn, with, space, and, time, axes, that, meet, at, right, angles, the, primed, frame, is, drawn, with, axes, that, meet, at, acute, or, obtuse, angles, this, asymmetry, is, due, to, unavoidable, distortions, in, how, spacetime, coordinates, map, onto, a, cartesian, plane, but, the, frames, are, actually, equivalent, the, consequences, of, special, relativity, can, be, derived, from, the, lorentz, transformation, equations, these, transformations, and, hence, special, relativity, lead, to, different, physical, predictions, than, those, of, newtonian, mechanics, at, all, relative, velocities, and, most, pronounced, when, relative, velocities, become, comparable, to, the, speed, of, light, the, speed, of, light, is, so, much, larger, than, anything, most, humans, encounter, that, some, of, the, effects, predicted, by, relativity, are, initially, counterintuitive, in, galilean, relativity, an, object, s, length, r, displaystyle, delta, r, and, the, temporal, separation, between, two, events, t, displaystyle, delta, t, are, independent, invariants, the, values, of, which, do, not, change, when, observed, from, different, frames, of, reference, in, special, relativity, however, the, interweaving, of, spatial, and, temporal, coordinates, generates, the, concept, of, an, invariant, interval, denoted, as, s, 2, displaystyle, delta, s, 2, s, 2, def, c, 2, t, 2, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, displaystyle, delta, s, 2, overset, text, def, c, 2, delta, t, 2, delta, x, 2, delta, y, 2, delta, z, 2, the, interweaving, of, space, and, time, revokes, the, implicitly, assumed, concepts, of, absolute, simultaneity, and, synchronization, across, non, comoving, frames, the, form, of, s, 2, displaystyle, delta, s, 2, being, the, difference, of, the, squared, time, lapse, and, the, squared, spatial, distance, demonstrates, a, fundamental, discrepancy, between, euclidean, and, spacetime, distances, the, invariance, of, this, interval, is, a, property, of, the, general, lorentz, transform, also, called, the, poincar, transformation, making, it, an, isometry, of, spacetime, the, general, lorentz, transform, extends, the, standard, lorentz, transform, which, deals, with, translations, without, rotation, that, is, lorentz, boosts, in, the, x, direction, with, all, other, translations, reflections, and, rotations, between, any, cartesian, inertial, frame, 33, 34, in, the, analysis, of, simplified, scenarios, such, as, spacetime, diagrams, a, reduced, dimensionality, form, of, the, invariant, interval, is, often, employed, s, 2, c, 2, t, 2, x, 2, displaystyle, delta, s, 2, c, 2, delta, t, 2, delta, x, 2, demonstrating, that, the, interval, is, invariant, is, straightforward, for, the, reduced,

cases, to, note, 25, 39, consider, two, events, happening, in, two, different, locations, that, occur, simultaneously, in, the, reference, frame, of, one, inertial, observer, they, may, occur, non,

simultaneous, in, another, frame, s, the, sagnac, effect, can, be, considered, a, manifestation, of, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, since, relativity, of, simultaneity, is, a, first, order, effect, in, v, displaystyle, v, instruments, based, on, the, sagnac, effect, for, their, operation, such, as, ring, laser, gyroscopes, and, fiber, optic, gyroscopes, are, capable, of, extreme, levels, of, sensitivity, the, time, lapse, between, two, events, is, not, invariant, from, one, observer, to, another, but, is, dependent, on, the, relative, speeds, of, the, observers, reference, frames, suppose, a, clock, is, at, rest, in, the, unprimed, system, s, the, location, of, the, clock, on, two, different, ticks, is, then, characterized, by, x, 0, to, find, the, relation, between, the, times, between, these, ticks, as, measured, in, both, systems, equation, 3, can, be, used, to, find, this, shows, that, the, time, t, between, the, two, ticks, as, seen, in, the, frame, in, which, the, clock, is, moving, s, is, longer, than, the, time, t, between, these, ticks, as, measured, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, clock, s, time, dilation, explains, a, number, of, physical, phenomena, for, example, the, lifetime, of, high, speed, muons, created, by, the, collision, of, cosmic, rays, with, particles, in, the, earth, s, outer, atmosphere, and, moving, towards, the, surface, is, greater, than, the, lifetime, of, slowly, moving, muons, created, and, decaying, in, a, laboratory, whenever, one, hears, a, statement, to, the, effect, that, moving, clocks, run, slow, one, should, envision, an, inertial, reference, frame, thickly, populated, with, identical, synchronized, clocks, as, a, moving, clock, travels, through, this, array, its, reading, at, any, particular, point, is, compared, with, a, stationary, clock, at, the, same, point, 149, 152, the, measurements, that, we, would, get, if, we, actually, looked, at, a, moving, clock, would, in, general, not, at, all, be, the, same, thing, because, the, time, that, would, see, would, be, delayed, by, the, finite, speed, of, light, i, e, the, times, that, we, see, would, be, distorted, by, the, doppler, effect, measurements, of, relativistic, effects, must, always, be, understood, as, having, been, made, after, finite, speed, of, light, effects, have, been, factored, out, 149, 152, paul, langevin, an, early, proponent, of, the, theory, of, relativity, did, much, to, popularize, the, theory, in, the, face, of, resistance, by, many, physicists, to, einstein, s, revolutionary, concepts, among, his, numerous, contributions, to, the, foundations, of, special, relativity, were, independent, work, on, the, mass, energy, relationship, a, thorough, examination, of, the, twin, paradox, and, investigations, into, rotating, coordinate, systems, his, name, is, frequently, attached, to, a, hypothetical, construct, called, a, light, clock, originally, developed, by, lewis, and, tolman, in, 1909, which, he, used, to, perform, a, novel, derivation, of, the, lorentz, transformation, a, light, clock, is, imagined, to, be, a, box, of, perfectly, reflecting, walls, wherein, a, light, signal, reflects, back, and, forth, from, opposite, faces, the, concept, of, time, dilation, is, frequently, taught, using, a, light, clock, that, is, traveling, in, uniform, inertial, motion, perpendicular, to, a, line, connecting, the, two, mirrors, langevin, himself, made, use, of, a, light, clock, oriented, parallel, to, its, line, of, motion, consider, the, scenario, illustrated, in, fig, 4, 3a, observer, a, holds, a, light, clock, of, length, l, displaystyle, l, as, well, as, an, electronic, timer, with, which, she, measures, how, long, it, takes, a, pulse, to, make, a, round, trip, up, and, down, along, the, light, clock, although, observer, a, is, traveling, rapidly, along, a, train, from, her, point, of, view, the, emission, and, receipt, of, the, pulse, occur, at, the, same, place, and, she, measures, the, interval, using, a, single, clock, located, at, the, precise, position, of, these, two, events, for, the, interval, between, these, two, events, observer, a, finds, t, a, 2, l, c, displaystyle, t, text, a, 2l, c, a, time, interval, measured, using, a, single, clock, which, is, motionless, in, a, particular, reference, frame, is, called, a, proper, time, interval, fig, 4, 3b, illustrates, these, same, two, events, from, the, standpoint, of, observer, b, who, is, parked, by, the, tracks, as, the, train, goes, by, at, a, speed, of, v, displaystyle, v, instead, of, making, straight, up, and, down, motions, observer, b, sees, the, pulses, moving, along, a, zig, zag, line, however, because, of, the, postulate, of, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, the, speed, of, the, pulses, along, these, diagonal, lines, is, the, same, c, displaystyle, c, that, observer, a, saw, for, her, up, and, down, pulses, b, measures, the, speed, of, the, vertical, component, of, these, pulses, as, c, 2, v, 2, textstyle, pm, sqrt, c, 2, v, 2, so, that, the, total, round, trip, time, of, the, pulses, is, t, b, 2, l, c, 2, v, 2, textstyle, t, b, 2l, big, sqrt, c, 2, v, 2, t, a, 1, v, 2, c, 2, textstyle, t, a, big, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, note, that, for, observer, b, the, emission, and, receipt, of, the, light, pulse, occurred, at, different, places, and, he, measured, the, interval, using, two, stationary, and, synchronized, clocks, located, at, two, different, positions, in, his, reference, frame, the, interval, that, b, measured, was, therefore, not, a, proper, time, interval, because, he, did, not, measure, it, with, a, single, resting, clock, in, the, above, description, of, the, langevin, light, clock, the, labeling, of, one, observer, as, stationary, and, the, other, as, in, motion, was, completely, arbitrary, one, could, just, as, well, have, observer, b, carrying, the, light, clock, and, moving, at, a, speed, of, v, displaystyle, v, to, the, left, in, which, case, observer, a, would, perceive, b, s, clock, as, running, slower, than, her, local, clock, there, is, no, paradox, here, because, there, is, no, independent, observer, c, who, will, agree, with, both, a, and, b, observer, c, necessarily, makes, his, measurements, from, his, own, reference, frame, if, that, reference, frame, coincides, with, a, s, reference, frame, then, c, will, agree, with, a, s, measurement, of, time, if, c, s, reference, frame, coincides, with, b, s, reference, frame, then, c, will, agree, with, b, s, measurement, of, time, if, c, s, reference, frame, coincides, with, neither, a, s, frame, nor, b, s, frame, then, c, s, measurement, of, time, will, disagree, with, both, a, s, and, b, s, measurement, of, time, the, reciprocity, of, time, dilation, between, two, observers, in, separate, inertial, frames, leads, to, the, so, called, twin, paradox, articulated, in, its, present, form, by, langevin, in, 1911, langevin, imagined, an, adventurer, wishing, to, explore, the, future, of, the, earth, this, traveler, boards, a, projectile, capable, of, traveling, at, 99, 995, of, the, speed, of, light, after, making, a, round, trip, journey, to, and, from, a, nearby, star, lasting, only, two, years, of, his, own, life, he, returns, to, an, earth, that, is, two, hundred, years, older, this, result, appears, puzzling, because, both, the, traveler, and, an, earthbound, observer, would, see, the, other, as, moving, and, so, because, of, the, reciprocity, of, time, dilation, one, might, initially, expect, that, each, should, have, found, the, other, to, have, aged, less, in, reality, there, is, no, paradox, at, all, because, in, order, for, the, two, observers, to, compare, their, proper, times, the, symmetry, of, the, situation, must, be, broken, at, least, one, of, the, two, observers, must, change, their, state, of, motion, to, match, that, of, the, other, knowing, the, general, resolution, of, the, paradox, however, does, not, immediately, yield, the, ability, to, calculate, correct, quantitative, results, many, solutions, to, this, puzzle, have, been, provided, in, the, literature, and, have, been, reviewed, in, the, twin, paradox, article, we, will, examine, in, the, following, one, such, solution, to, the, paradox, our, basic, aim, will, be, to, demonstrate, that, after, the, trip, both, twins, are, in, perfect, agreement, about, who, aged, by, how, much, regardless, of, their, different, experiences, fig, 4, 4, illustrates, a, scenario, where, the, traveling, twin, flies, at, 0, 6, c, to, and, from, a, star, 3, ly, distant, during, the, trip, each, twin, sends, yearly, time, signals, measured, in, their, own, proper, times, to, the, other, after, the, trip, the, cumulative, counts, are, compared, on, the, outward, phase, of, the, trip, each, twin, receives, the, other, s, signals, at, the, lowered, rate, of, f, f, 1, 1, textstyle, f, f, sqrt, 1, beta, 1, beta, initially, the, situation, is, perfectly, symmetric, note, that, each, twin, receives, the, other, s, one, year, signal, at, two, years, measured, on, their, own, clock, the, symmetry, is, broken, when, the, traveling, twin, turns, around, at, the, four, year, mark, as, measured, by, her, clock, during, the, remaining, four, years, of, her, trip, she, receives, signals, at, the, enhanced, rate, of, f, f, 1, 1, textstyle, f, f, sqrt, 1, beta, 1, beta, the, situation, is, quite, different, with, the, stationary, twin, because, of, light, speed, delay, he, does, not, see, his, sister, turn, around, until, eight, years, have, passed, on, his, own, clock, thus, he, receives, enhanced, rate, signals, from, his, sister, for, only, a, relatively, brief, period, although, the, twins, disagree, in, their, respective, measures, of, total, time, we, see, in, the, following, table, as, well, as, by, simple, observation, of, the, minkowski, diagram, that, each, twin, is, in, total, agreement, with, the, other, as, to, the, total, number, of, signals, sent, from, one, to, the, other, there, is, hence, no, paradox, 152, 159, the, dimensions, e, g, length, of, an, object, as, measured, by, one, observer, may, be, smaller, than, the, results, of, measurements, of, the, same, object, made, by, another, observer, e, g, the, ladder, paradox, involves, a, long, ladder, traveling, near, the, speed, of, light, and, being, contained, within, a, smaller, garage, similarly, suppose, a, measuring, rod, is, at, rest, and, aligned, along, the, x, axis, in, the, unprimed, system, s, in, this, system, the, length, of, this, rod, is, written, as, x, to, measure, the, length, of, this, rod, in, the, system, s, in, which, the, rod, is, moving, the, distances, x, to, the, end, points, of, the, rod, must, be, measured, simultaneously, in, that, system, s, in, other, words, the, measurement, is, characterized, by, t, 0, which, can, be, combined, with, equation, 4, to, find, the, relation, between, the, lengths, x, and, x, this, shows, that, the, length, x, of, the, rod, as, measured, in, the, frame, in, which, it, is, moving, s, is, shorter, than, its, length, x, in, its, own, rest, frame, s, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, are, not, merely, appearances, time, dilation, is, explicitly, related, to, our, way, of, measuring, time, intervals, between, events, that, occur, at, the, same, place, in, a, given, coordinate, system, called, co, local, events, these, time, intervals, which, can, be, and, are, actually, measured, experimentally, by, relevant, observers, are, different, in, another, coordinate, system, moving, with, respect, to, the, first, unless, the, events, in, addition, to, being, co, local, are, also, simultaneous, similarly, length, contraction, relates, to, our, measured, distances, between, separated, but, simultaneous, events, in, a, given, coordinate, system, of, choice, if, these, events, are, not, co, local, but, are, separated, by, distance, space, they, will, not, occur, at, the, same, spatial, distance, from, each, other, when, seen, from, another, moving, coordinate, system, consider, two, frames, s, and, s, in, standard, configuration, a, particle, in, s, moves, in, the, x, direction, with, velocity, vector, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, what, is, its, velocity, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, in, frame, s, we, can, write, substituting, expressions, for, d, x, displaystyle, dx, and, d, t, displaystyle, dt, from, equation, 5, into, equation, 8, followed, by, straightforward, mathematical, manipulations, and, back, substitution, from, equation, 7, yields, the, lorentz, transformation, of, the, speed, u, displaystyle, u, to, u, displaystyle, u, the, inverse, relation, is, obtained, by, interchanging, the, primed, and, unprimed, symbols, and, replacing, v, displaystyle, v, with, v, displaystyle, v, for, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, not, aligned, along, the, x, axis, we, write, 47, 49, the, forward, and, inverse, transformations, for, this, case, are, equation, 10, and, equation, 14, can, be, interpreted, as, giving, the, resultant, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, of, the, two, velocities, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, and, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, and, they, replace, the, formula, u, u, v, displaystyle, mathbf, u, u, v, which, is, valid, in, galilean, relativity, interpreted, in, such, a, fashion, they, are, commonly, referred, to, as, the, relativistic, velocity, addition, or, composition, formulas, valid, for, the, three, axes, of, s, and, s, being, aligned, with, each, other, although, not, necessarily, in, standard, configuration, 47, 49, we, note, the, following, points, there, is, nothing, special, about, the, x, direction, in, the, standard, configuration, the, above, formalism, applies, to, any, direction, and, three, orthogonal, directions, allow, dealing, with, all, directions, in, space, by, decomposing, the, velocity, vectors, to, their, components, in, these, directions, see, velocity, addition, formula, for, details, the, composition, of, two, non, collinear, lorentz, boosts, i, e, two, non, collinear, lorentz, transformations, neither, of, which, involve, rotation, results, in, a, lorentz, transformation, that, is, not, a, pure, boost, but, is, the, composition, of, a, boost, and, a, rotation, thomas, rotation, results, from, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, in, fig, 4, 5a, a, rod, of, length, l, displaystyle, l, in, its, rest, frame, i, e, having, a, proper, length, of, l, displaystyle, l, rises, vertically, along, the, y, axis, in, the, ground, frame, in, fig, 4, 5b, the, same, rod, is, observed, from, the, frame, of, a, rocket, moving, at, speed, v, displaystyle, v, to, the, right, if, we, imagine, two, clocks, situated, at, the, left, and, right, ends, of, the, rod, that, are, synchronized, in, the, frame, of, the, rod, relativity, of, simultaneity, causes, the, observer, in, the, rocket, frame, to, observe, not, see, the, clock, at, the, right, end, of, the, rod, as, being, advanced, in, time, by, l, v, c, 2, displaystyle, lv, c, 2, and, the, rod, is, correspondingly, observed, as, tilted, 98, 99, unlike, second, order, relativistic, effects, such, as, length, contraction, or, time, dilation, this, effect, becomes, quite, significant, even, at, fairly, low, velocities, for, example, this, can, be, seen, in, the, spin, of, moving, particles, where, thomas, precession, is, a, relativistic, correction, that, applies, to, the, spin, of, an, elementary, particle, or, the, rotation, of, a, macroscopic, gyroscope, relating, the, angular, velocity, of, the, spin, of, a, particle, following, a, curvilinear, orbit, to, the, angular, velocity, of, the, orbital, motion, 169, 174, thomas, rotation, provides, the, resolution, to, the, well, known, meter, stick, and, hole, paradox, 98, 99, in, fig, 4, 6, the, time, interval, between, the, events, a, the, cause, and, b, the, effect, is, time, like, that, is, there, is, a, frame, of, reference, in, which, events, a, and, b, occur, at, the, same, location, in, space, separated, only, by, occurring, at, different, times, if, a, precedes, b, in, that, frame, then, a, precedes, b, in, all, frames, accessible, by, a, lorentz, transformation, it, is, possible, for, matter, or, information, to, travel, below, light, speed, from, the, location, of, a, starting, at, the, time, of, a, to, the, location, of, b, arriving, at, the, time, of, b, so, there, can, be, a, causal, relationship, with, a, the, cause, and, b, the, effect, the, interval, ac, in, the, diagram, is, space, like, that, is, there, is, a, frame, of, reference, in, which, events, a, and, c, occur, simultaneously, separated, only, in, space, there, are, also, frames, in, which, a, precedes, c, as, shown, and, frames, in, which, c, precedes, a, but, no, frames, are, accessible, by, a, lorentz, transformation, in, which, events, a, and, c, occur, at, the, same, location, if, it, were, possible, for, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, to, exist, between, events, a, and, c, paradoxes, of, causality, would, result, for, example, if, signals, could, be, sent, faster, than, light, then, signals, could, be, sent, into, the, sender, s, past, observer, b, in, the, diagrams, a, variety, of, causal, paradoxes, could, then, be, constructed, consider, the, spacetime, diagrams, in, fig, 4, 7, a, and, b, stand, alongside, a, railroad, track, when, a, high, speed, train, passes, by, with, c, riding, in, the, last, car, of, the, train, and, d, riding, in, the, leading, car, the, world, lines, of, a, and, b, are, vertical, ct, distinguishing, the, stationary, position, of, these, observers, on, the, ground, while, the, world, lines, of, c, and, d, are, tilted, forwards, ct, reflecting, the, rapid, motion, of, the, observers, c, and, d, stationary, in, their, train, as, observed, from, the, ground, it, is, not, necessary, for, signals, to, be, instantaneous, to, violate, causality, even, if, the, signal, from, d, to, c, were, slightly, shallower, than, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, and, the, signal, from, a, to, b, slightly, steeper, than, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, it, would, still, be, possible, for, b, to, receive, his, message, before, he, had, sent, it, by, increasing, the, speed, of, the, train, to, near, light, speeds, the, c, t, displaystyle, ct, and, x, displaystyle, x, axes, can, be, squeezed, very, close, to, the, dashed, line, representing, the, speed, of, light, with, this, modified, setup, it, can, be, demonstrated, that, even, signals, only, slightly, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, will, result, in, causality, violation, therefore, if, causality, is, to, be, preserved, one, of, the, consequences, of, special, relativity, is, that, no, information, signal, or, material, object, can, travel, faster, than, light, in, vacuum, this, is, not, to, say, that, all, faster, than, light, speeds, are, impossible, various, trivial, situations, can, be, described, where, some, things, not, actual, matter, or, energy, move, faster, than, light, for, example, the, location, where, the, beam, of, a, search, light, hits, the, bottom, of, a, cloud, can, move, faster, than, light, when, the, search, light, is, turned, rapidly, although, this, does, not, violate, causality, or, any, other, relativistic, phenomenon, in, 1850, hippolyte, fizeau, and, l, on, foucault, independently, established, that, light, travels, more, slowly, in, water, than, in, air, thus, validating, a, prediction, of, fresnel, s, wave, theory, of, light, and, invalidating, the, corresponding, prediction, of, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, the, speed, of, light, was, measured, in, still, water, what, would, be, the, speed, of, light, in, flowing, water, in, 1851, fizeau, conducted, an, experiment, to, answer, this, question, a, simplified, representation, of, which, is, illustrated, in, fig, 5, 1, a, beam, of, light, is, divided, by, a, beam, splitter, and, the, split, beams, are, passed, in, opposite, directions, through, a, tube, of, flowing, water, they, are, recombined, to, form, interference, fringes, indicating, a, difference, in, optical, path, length, that, an, observer, can, view, the, experiment, demonstrated, that, dragging, of, the, light, by, the, flowing, water, caused, a, displacement, of, the, fringes, showing, that, the, motion, of, the, water, had, affected, the, speed, of, the, light, according, to, the, theories, prevailing, at, the, time, light, traveling, through, a, moving, medium, would, be, a, simple, sum, of, its, speed, through, the, medium, plus, the, speed, of, the, medium, contrary, to, expectation, fizeau, found, that, although, light, appeared, to, be, dragged, by, the, water, the, magnitude, of, the, dragging, was, much, lower, than, expected, if, u, c, n, displaystyle, u, c, n, is, the, speed, of, light, in, still, water, and, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, speed, of, the, water, and, u, displaystyle, u, pm, is, the, water, borne, speed, of, light, in, the, lab, frame, with, the, flow, of, water, adding, to, or, subtracting, from, the, speed, of, light, then, u, c, n, v, 1, 1, n, 2, displaystyle, u, pm, frac, c, n, pm, v, left, 1, frac, 1, n, 2, right, fizeau, s, results, although, consistent, with, fresnel, s, earlier, hypothesis, of, partial, aether, dragging, were, extremely, disconcerting, to, physicists, of, the, time, among, other, things, the, presence, of, an, index, of, refraction, term, meant, that, since, n, displaystyle, n, depends, on, wavelength, the, aether, must, be, capable, of, sustaining, different, motions, at, the, same, time, a, variety, of, theoretical, explanations, were, proposed, to, explain, fresnel, s, dragging, coefficient, that, were, completely, at, odds, with, each, other, even, before, the, michelson, morley, experiment, fizeau, s, experimental, results, were, among, a, number, of, observations, that, created, a, critical, situation, in, explaining, the, optics, of, moving, bodies, from, the, point, of, view, of, special, relativity, fizeau, s, result, is, nothing, but, an, approximation, to, equation, 10, the, relativistic, formula, for, composition, of, velocities, because, of, the, finite, speed, of, light, if, the, relative, motions, of, a, source, and, receiver, include, a, transverse, component, then, the, direction, from, which, light, arrives, at, the, receiver, will, be, displaced, from, the, geometric, position, in, space, of, the, source, relative, to, the, receiver, the, classical, calculation, of, the, displacement, takes, two, forms, and, makes, different, predictions, depending, on, whether, the, receiver, the, source, or, both, are, in, motion, with, respect, to, the, medium, 1, if, the, receiver, is, in, motion, the, displacement, would, be, the, consequence, of, the, aberration, of, light, the, incident, angle, of, the, beam, relative, to, the, receiver, would, be, calculable, from, the, vector, sum, of, the, receiver, s, motions, and, the, velocity, of, the, incident, light, 2, if, the, source, is, in, motion, the, displacement, would, be, the, consequence, of, light, time, correction, the, displacement, of, the, apparent, position, of, the, source, from, its, geometric, position, would, be, the, result, of, the, source, s, motion, during, the, time, that, its, light, takes, to, reach, the, receiver, the, classical, explanation, failed, experimental, test, since, the, aberration, angle, depends, on, the, relationship, between, the, velocity, of, the, receiver, and, the, speed, of, the, incident, light, passage, of, the, incident, light, through, a, refractive, medium, should, change, the, aberration, angle, in, 1810, arago, used, this, expected, phenomenon, in, a, failed, attempt, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, and, in, 1870, george, airy, tested, the, hypothesis, using, a, water, filled, telescope, finding, that, against, expectation, the, measured, aberration, was, identical, to, the, aberration, measured, with, an, air, filled, telescope, a, cumbrous, attempt, to, explain, these, results, used, the, hypothesis, of, partial, aether, drag, but, was, incompatible, with, the, results, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, which, apparently, demanded, complete, aether, drag, assuming, inertial, frames, the, relativistic, expression, for, the, aberration, of, light, is, applicable, to, both, the, receiver, moving, and, source, moving, cases, a, variety, of, trigonometrically, equivalent, formulas, have, been, published, expressed, in, terms, of, the, variables, in, fig, 5, 2, these, include, 57, 60, the, classical, doppler, effect, depends, on, whether, the, source, receiver, or, both, are, in, motion, with, respect, to, the, medium, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, is, independent, of, any, medium, nevertheless, relativistic, doppler, shift, for, the, longitudinal, case, with, source, and, receiver, moving, directly, towards, or, away, from, each, other, can, be, derived, as, if, it, were, the, classical, phenomenon, but, modified, by, the, addition, of, a, time, dilation, term, and, that, is, the, treatment, described, here, assume, the, receiver, and, the, source, are, moving, away, from, each, other, with, a, relative, speed, v, displaystyle, v, as, measured, by, an, observer, on, the, receiver, or, the, source, the, sign, convention, adopted, here, is, that, v, displaystyle, v, is, negative, if, the, receiver, and, the, source, are, moving, towards, each, other, assume, that, the, source, is, stationary, in, the, medium, then, f, r, 1, v, c, s, f, s, displaystyle, f, r, left, 1, frac, v, c, s, right, f, s, where, c, s, displaystyle, c, s, is, the, speed, of, sound, for, light, and, with, the, receiver, moving, at, relativistic, speeds, clocks, on, the, receiver, are, time, dilated, relative, to, clocks, at, the, source, the, receiver, will, measure, the, received, frequency, to, be,

when, performing, the, analysis, in, the, reference, frame, of, the, receiver, with, a, moving, source, the, transverse, doppler, effect, is, one, of, the, main, novel, predictions, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, classically, one, might, expect, that, if, source, and, receiver, are, moving, transversely, with, respect, to, each, other, with, no, longitudinal, component, to, their, relative, motions, that, there, should, be, no, doppler, shift, in, the, light, arriving, at, the, receiver, special, relativity, predicts, otherwise, fig, 5, 3, illustrates, two, common, variants, of, this, scenario, both, variants, can, be, analyzed, using, simple, time, dilation, arguments, in, fig, 5, 3a, the, receiver, observes, light, from, the, source, as, being, blueshifted, by, a, factor, of, displaystyle, gamma, in, fig, 5, 3b, the, light, is, redshifted, by, the, same, factor, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, are, not, optical, illusions, but, genuine, effects, measurements, of, these, effects, are, not, an, artifact, of, doppler, shift, nor, are, they, the, result, of, neglecting, to, take, into, account, the, time, it, takes, light, to, travel, from, an, event, to, an, observer, scientists, make, a, fundamental, distinction, between, measurement, or, observation, on, the, one, hand, versus, visual, appearance, or, what, one, sees, the, measured, shape, of, an, object, is, a, hypothetical, snapshot, of, all, of, the, object, s, points, as, they, exist, at, a, single, moment, in, time, but, the, visual, appearance, of, an, object, is, affected, by, the, varying, lengths, of, time, that, light, takes, to, travel, from, different, points, on, the, object, to, one, s, eye, for, many, years, the, distinction, between, the, two, had, not, been, generally, appreciated, and, it, had, generally, been, thought, that, a, length, contracted, object, passing, by, an, observer, would, in, fact, actually, be, seen, as, length, contracted, in, 1959, james, terrell, and, roger, penrose, independently, pointed, out, that, differential, time, lag, effects, in, signals, reaching, the, observer, from, the, different, parts, of, a, moving, object, result, in, a, fast, moving, object, s, visual, appearance, being, quite, different, from, its, measured, shape, for, example, a, receding, object, would, appear, contracted, an, approaching, object, would, appear, elongated, and, a, passing, object, would, have, a, skew, appearance, that, has, been, likened, to, a, rotation, a, sphere, in, motion, retains, the, circular, outline, for, all, speeds, for, any, distance, and, for, all, view, angles, although, the, surface, of, the, sphere, and, the, images, on, it, will, appear, distorted, both, fig, 5, 4, and, fig, 5, 5, illustrate, objects, moving, transversely, to, the, line, of, sight, in, fig, 5, 4, a, cube, is, viewed, from, a, distance, of, four, times, the, length, of, its, sides, at, high, speeds, the, sides, of, the, cube, that, are, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, motion, appear, hyperbolic, in, shape, the, cube, is, actually, not, rotated, rather, light, from, the, rear, of, the, cube, takes, longer, to, reach, one, s, eyes, compared, with, light, from, the, front, during, which, time, the, cube, has, moved, to, the, right, at, high, speeds, the, sphere, in, fig, 5, 5, takes, on, the, appearance, of, a, flattened, disk, tilted, up, to, 45, from, the, line, of, sight, if, the, objects, motions, are, not, strictly, transverse, but, instead, include, a, longitudinal, component, exaggerated, distortions, in, perspective, may, be, seen, this, illusion, has, come, to, be, known, as, terrell, rotation, or, the, terrell, penrose, effect, another, example, where, visual, appearance, is, at, odds, with, measurement, comes, from, the, observation, of, apparent, superluminal, motion, in, various, radio, galaxies, bl, lac, objects, quasars, and, other, astronomical, objects, that, eject, relativistic, speed, jets, of, matter, at, narrow, angles, with, respect, to, the, viewer, an, apparent, optical, illusion, results, giving, the, appearance, of, faster, than, light, travel, in, fig, 5, 6, galaxy, m87, streams, out, a, high, speed, jet, of, subatomic, particles, almost, directly, towards, us, but, penrose, terrell, rotation, causes, the, jet, to, appear, to, be, moving, laterally, in, the, same, manner, that, the, appearance, of, the, cube, in, fig, 5, 4, has, been, stretched, out, section, consequences, derived, from, the, lorentz, transformation, dealt, strictly, with, kinematics, the, study, of, the, motion, of, points, bodies, and, systems, of, bodies, without, considering, the, forces, that, caused, the, motion, this, section, discusses, masses, forces, energy, and, so, forth, and, as, such, requires, consideration, of, physical, effects, beyond, those, encompassed, by, the, lorentz, transformation, itself, as, an, object, s, speed, approaches, the, speed, of, light, from, an, observer, s, point, of, view, its, relativistic, mass, increases, thereby, making, it, more, and, more, difficult, to, accelerate, it, from, within, the, observer, s, frame, of, reference, the, energy, content, of, an, object, at, rest, with, mass, m, equals, mc, 2, conservation, of, energy, implies, that, in, any, reaction, a, decrease, of, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, particles, must, be, accompanied, by, an, increase, in, kinetic, energies, of, the, particles, after, the, reaction, similarly, the, mass, of, an, object, can, be, increased, by, taking, in, kinetic, energies, in, addition, to, the, papers, referenced, above, which, give, derivations, of, the, lorentz, transformation, and, describe, the, foundations, of, special, relativity, einstein, also, wrote, at, least, four, papers, giving, heuristic, arguments, for, the, equivalence, and, transmutability, of, mass, and, energy, for, e, mc, 2, mass, energy, equivalence, is, a, consequence, of, special, relativity, the, energy, and, momentum, which, are, separate, in, newtonian, mechanics, form, a, four, vector, in, relativity, and, this, relates, the, time, component, the, energy, to, the, space, components, the, momentum, in, a, non, trivial, way, for, an, object, at, rest, the, energy, momentum, four, vector, is, e, c, 0, 0, 0, it, has, a, time, component, which, is, the, energy, and, three, space, components, which, are, zero, by, changing, frames, with, a, lorentz, transformation, in, the, x, direction, with, a, small, value, of, the, velocity, v, the, energy, momentum, four, vector, becomes, e, c, ev, c, 2, 0, 0, the, momentum, is, equal, to, the, energy, multiplied, by, the, velocity, divided, by, c, 2, as, such, the, newtonian, mass, of, an, object, which, is, the, ratio, of, the, momentum, to, the, velocity, for, slow, velocities, is, equal, to, e, c, 2, the, energy, and, momentum, are, properties, of, matter, and, radiation, and, it, is, impossible, to, deduce, that, they, form, a, four, vector, just, from, the, two, basic, postulates, of, special, relativity, by, themselves, because, these, do, not, talk, about, matter, or, radiation, they, only, talk, about, space, and, time, the, derivation, therefore, requires, some, additional, physical, reasoning, in, his, 1905, paper, einstein, used, the, additional, principles, that, newtonian, mechanics, should, hold, for, slow, velocities, so, that, there, is, one, energy, scalar, and, one, three, vector, momentum, at, slow, velocities, and, that, the, conservation, law, for, energy, and, momentum, is, exactly, true, in, relativity, furthermore, he, assumed, that, the, energy, of, light, is, transformed, by, the, same, doppler, shift, factor, as, its, frequency, which, he, had, previously, shown, to, be, true, based, on, maxwell, s, equations, the, first, of, einstein, s, papers, on, this, subject, was, does, the, inertia, of, a, body, depend, upon, its, energy, content, in, 1905, although, einstein, s, argument, in, this, paper, is, nearly, universally, accepted, by, physicists, as, correct, even, self, evident, many, authors, over, the, years, have, suggested, that, it, is, wrong, other, authors, suggest, that, the, argument, was, merely, inconclusive, because, it, relied, on, some, implicit, assumptions, einstein, acknowledged, the, controversy, over, his, derivation, in, his, 1907, survey, paper, on, special, relativity, there, he, notes, that, it, is, problematic, to, rely, on, maxwell, s, equations, for, the, heuristic, mass, energy, argument, the, argument, in, his, 1905, paper, can, be, carried, out, with, the, emission, of, any, massless, particles, but, the, maxwell, equations, are, implicitly, used, to, make, it, obvious, that, the, emission, of, light, in, particular, can, be, achieved, only, by, doing, work, to, emit, electromagnetic, waves, all, you, have, to, do, is, shake, a, charged, particle, and, this, is, clearly, doing, work, so, that, the, emission, is, of, energy, in, his, fourth, of, his, 1905, annus, mirabilis, papers, einstein, presented, a, heuristic, argument, for, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, although, as, discussed, above, subsequent, scholarship, has, established, that, his, arguments, fell, short, of, a, broadly, definitive, proof, the, conclusions, that, he, reached, in, this, paper, have, stood, the, test, of, time, einstein, took, as, starting, assumptions, his, recently, discovered, formula, for, relativistic, doppler, shift, the, laws, of, conservation, of, energy, and, conservation, of, momentum, and, the, relationship, between, the, frequency, of, light, and, its, energy, as, implied, by, maxwell, s, equations, fig, 6, 1, top, consider, a, system, of, plane, waves, of, light, having, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, traveling, in, direction, displaystyle, phi, relative, to, the, x, axis, of, reference, frame, s, the, frequency, and, hence, energy, of, the, waves, as, measured, in, frame, s, that, is, moving, along, the, x, axis, at, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, is, given, by, the, relativistic, doppler, shift, formula, which, einstein, had, developed, in, his, 1905, paper, on, special, relativity, fig, 6, 1, bottom, consider, an, arbitrary, body, that, is, stationary, in, reference, frame, s, let, this, body, emit, a, pair, of, equal, energy, light, pulses, in, opposite, directions, at, angle, displaystyle, phi, with, respect, to, the, x, axis, each, pulse, has, energy, l, 2, displaystyle, l, 2, because, of, conservation, of, momentum, the, body, remains, stationary, in, s, after, emission, of, the, two, pulses, let, e, 0, displaystyle, e, 0, be, the, energy, of, the, body, before, emission, of, the, two, pulses, and, e, 1, displaystyle, e, 1, after, their, emission, next, consider, the, same, system, observed, from, frame, s, that, is, moving, along, the, x, axis, at, speed, v, displaystyle, v, relative, to, frame, s, in, this, frame, light, from, the, forwards, and, reverse, pulses, will, be, relativistically, doppler, shifted, let, h, 0, displaystyle, h, 0, be, the, energy, of, the, body, measured, in, reference, frame, s, before, emission, of, the, two, pulses, and, h, 1, displaystyle, h, 1, after, their, emission, we, obtain, the, following, relationships, from, the, above, equations, we, obtain, the, following, the, two, differences, of, form, h, e, displaystyle, h, e, seen, in, the, above, equation, have, a, straightforward, physical, interpretation, since, h, displaystyle, h, and, e, displaystyle, e, are, the, energies, of, the, arbitrary, body, in, the, moving, and, stationary, frames, h, 0, e, 0, displaystyle, h, 0, e, 0, and, h, 1, e, 1, displaystyle, h, 1, e, 1, represents, the, kinetic, energies, of, the, bodies, before, and, after, the, emission, of, light, except, for, an, additive, constant, that, fixes, the, zero, point, of, energy, and, is, conventionally, set, to, zero, hence, taking, a, taylor, series, expansion, and, neglecting, higher, order, terms, he, obtained, comparing, the, above, expression, with, the, classical, expression, for, kinetic, energy, k, e, 1, 2, mv, 2, einstein, then, noted, if, a, body, gives, off, the, energy, l, in, the, form, of, radiation, its, mass, diminishes, by, l, c, 2, rindler, has, observed, that, einstein, s, heuristic, argument, suggested, merely, that, energy, contributes, to, mass, in, 1905, einstein, s, cautious, expression, of, the, mass, energy, relationship, allowed, for, the, possibility, that, dormant, mass, might, exist, that, would, remain, behind, after, all, the, energy, of, a, body, was, removed, by, 1907, however, einstein, was, ready, to, assert, that, all, inertial, mass, represented, a, reserve, of, energy, to, equate, all, mass, with, energy, required, an, act, of, aesthetic, faith, very, characteristic, of, einstein, 81, 84, einstein, s, bold, hypothesis, has, been, amply, confirmed, in, the, years, subsequent, to, his, original, proposal, for, a, variety, of, reasons, einstein, s, original, derivation, is, currently, seldom, taught, besides, the, vigorous, debate, that, continues, until, this, day, as, to, the, formal, correctness, of, his, original, derivation, the, recognition, of, special, relativity, as, being, what, einstein, called, a, principle, theory, has, led, to, a, shift, away, from, reliance, on, electromagnetic, phenomena, to, purely, dynamic, methods, of, proof, since, nothing, can, travel, faster, than, light, one, might, conclude, that, a, human, can, never, travel, farther, from, earth, than, 100, light, years, you, would, easily, think, that, a, traveler, would, never, be, able, to, reach, more, than, the, few, solar, systems, which, exist, within, the, limit, of, 100, light, years, from, earth, however, because, of, time, dilation, a, hypothetical, spaceship, can, travel, thousands, of, light, years, during, a, passenger, s, lifetime, if, a, spaceship, could, be, built, that, accelerates, at, a, constant, 1, g, it, will, after, one, year, be, travelling, at, almost, the, speed, of, light, as, seen, from, earth, this, is, described, by, v, t, a, t, 1, a, 2, t, 2, c, 2, displaystyle, v, t, frac, at, sqrt, 1, a, 2, t, 2, c, 2, where, v, t, is, the, velocity, at, a, time, t, a, is, the, acceleration, of, the, spaceship, and, t, is, the, coordinate, time, as, measured, by, people, on, earth, therefore, after, one, year, of, accelerating, at, 9, 81, m, s, 2, the, spaceship, will, be, travelling, at, v, 0, 712, c, and, 0, 946, c, after, three, years, relative, to, earth, after, three, years, of, this, acceleration, with, the, spaceship, achieving, a, velocity, of, 94, 6, of, the, speed, of, light, relative, to, earth, time, dilation, will, result, in, each, second, experienced, on, the, spaceship, corresponding, to, 3, 1, seconds, back, on, earth, during, their, journey, people, on, earth, will, experience, more, time, than, they, do, since, their, clocks, all, physical, phenomena, would, really, be, ticking, 3, 1, times, faster, than, those, of, the, spaceship, a, 5, year, round, trip, for, the, traveller, will, take, 6, 5, earth, years, and, cover, a, distance, of, over, 6, light, years, a, 20, year, round, trip, for, them, 5, years, accelerating, 5, decelerating, twice, each, will, land, them, back, on, earth, having, travelled, for, 335, earth, years, and, a, distance, of, 331, light, years, a, full, 40, year, trip, at, 1, g, will, appear, on, earth, to, last, 58, 000, years, and, cover, a, distance, of, 55, 000, light, years, a, 40, year, trip, at, 1, 1, g, will, take, 148, 000, earth, years, and, cover, about, 140, 000, light, years, a, one, way, 28, year, 14, years, accelerating, 14, decelerating, as, measured, with, the, astronaut, s, clock, trip, at, 1, g, acceleration, could, reach, 2, 000, 000, light, years, to, the, andromeda, galaxy, this, same, time, dilation, is, why, a, muon, travelling, close, to, c, is, observed, to, travel, much, farther, than, c, times, its, half, life, when, at, rest, examination, of, the, collision, products, generated, by, particle, accelerators, around, the, world, provides, scientists, evidence, of, the, structure, of, the, subatomic, world, and, the, natural, laws, governing, it, analysis, of, the, collision, products, the, sum, of, whose, masses, may, vastly, exceed, the, masses, of, the, incident, particles, requires, special, relativity, in, newtonian, mechanics, analysis, of, collisions, involves, use, of, the, conservation, laws, for, mass, momentum, and, energy, in, relativistic, mechanics, mass, is, not, independently, conserved, because, it, has, been, subsumed, into, the, total, relativistic, energy, we, illustrate, the, differences, that, arise, between, the, newtonian, and, relativistic, treatments, of, particle, collisions, by, examining, the, simple, case, of, two, perfectly, elastic, colliding, particles, of, equal, mass, inelastic, collisions, are, discussed, in, spacetime, conservation, laws, radioactive, decay, may, be, considered, a, sort, of, time, reversed, inelastic, collision, elastic, scattering, of, charged, elementary, particles, deviates, from, ideality, due, to, the, production, of, bremsstrahlung, radiation, fig, 6, 2, provides, a, demonstration, of, the, result, familiar, to, billiard, players, that, if, a, stationary, ball, is, struck, elastically, by, another, one, of, the, same, mass, assuming, no, sidespin, or, english, then, after, collision, the, diverging, paths, of, the, two, balls, will, subtend, a, right, angle, a, in, the, stationary, frame, an, incident, sphere, traveling, at, 2, v, strikes, a, stationary, sphere, b, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, the, two, spheres, approach, each, other, symmetrically, at, v, after, elastic, collision, the, two, spheres, rebound, from, each, other, with, equal, and, opposite, velocities, u, energy, conservation, requires, that, u, v, c, reverting, to, the, stationary, frame, the, rebound, velocities, are, v, u, the, dot, product, v, u, v, u, v, 2, u, 2, 0, indicating, that, the, vectors, are, orthogonal, 26, 27, consider, the, elastic, collision, scenario, in, fig, 6, 3, between, a, moving, particle, colliding, with, an, equal, mass, stationary, particle, unlike, the, newtonian, case, the, angle, between, the, two, particles, after, collision, is, less, than, 90, is, dependent, on, the, angle, of, scattering, and, becomes, smaller, and, smaller, as, the, velocity, of, the, incident, particle, approaches, the, speed, of, light, the, relativistic, momentum, and, total, relativistic, energy, of, a, particle, are, given, by, conservation, of, momentum, dictates, that, the, sum, of, the, momenta, of, the, incoming, particle, and, the, stationary, particle, which, initially, has, momentum, 0, equals, the, sum, of, the, momenta, of, the, emergent, particles, likewise, the, sum, of, the, total, relativistic, energies, of, the, incoming, particle, and, the, stationary, particle, which, initially, has, total, energy, mc, 2, equals, the, sum, of, the, total, energies, of, the, emergent, particles, breaking, down, 6, 5, into, its, components, replacing, v, displaystyle, v, with, the, dimensionless, displaystyle, beta, and, factoring, out, common, terms, from, 6, 5, and, 6, 6, yields, the, following, from, these, we, obtain, the, following, relationships, for, the, symmetrical, case, in, which, displaystyle, phi, theta, and, 2, 3, displaystyle, beta, 2, beta, 3, 6, 12, takes, on, the, simpler, form, lorentz, transformations, relate, coordinates, of, events, in, one, reference, frame, to, those, of, another, frame, relativistic, composition, of, velocities, is, used, to, add, two, velocities, together, the, formulas, to, perform, the, latter, computations, are, nonlinear, making, them, more, complex, than, the, corresponding, galilean, formulas, this, nonlinearity, is, an, artifact, of, our, choice, of, parameters, 47, 59, we, have, previously, noted, that, in, an, x, ct, spacetime, diagram, the, points, at, some, constant, spacetime, interval, from, the, origin, form, an, invariant, hyperbola, we, have, also, noted, that, the, coordinate, systems, of, two, spacetime, reference, frames, in, standard, configuration, are, hyperbolically, rotated, with, respect, to, each, other, the, natural, functions, for, expressing, these, relationships, are, the, hyperbolic, analogs, of, the, trigonometric, functions, fig, 7, 1a, shows, a, unit, circle, with, sin, a, and, cos, a, the, only, difference, between, this, diagram, and, the, familiar, unit, circle, of, elementary, trigonometry, being, that, a, is, interpreted, not, as, the, angle, between, the, ray, and, the, x, axis, but, as, twice, the, area, of, the, sector, swept, out, by, the, ray, from, the, x, axis, numerically, the, angle, and, 2, area, measures, for, the, unit, circle, are, identical, fig, 7, 1b, shows, a, unit, hyperbola, with, sinh, a, and, cosh, a, where, a, is, likewise, interpreted, as, twice, the, tinted, area, fig, 7, 2, presents, plots, of, the, sinh, cosh, and, tanh, functions, for, the, unit, circle, the, slope, of, the, ray, is, given, by, in, the, cartesian, plane, rotation, of, point, x, y, into, point, x, y, by, angle, is, given, by, in, a, spacetime, diagram, the, velocity, parameter, displaystyle, beta, is, the, analog, of, slope, the, rapidity, is, defined, by, 96, 99, where, the, rapidity, defined, above, is, very, useful, in, special, relativity, because, many, expressions, take, on, a, considerably, simpler, form, when, expressed, in, terms, of, it, for, example, rapidity, is, simply, additive, in, the, collinear, velocity, addition, formula, 47, 59, or, in, other, words, 1, 2, displaystyle, phi, phi, 1, phi, 2, the, lorentz, transformations, take, a, simple, form, when, expressed, in, terms, of, rapidity, the, factor, can, be, written, as, transformations, describing, relative, motion, with, uniform, velocity, and, without, rotation, of, the, space, coordinate, axes, are, called, boosts, substituting, and, into, the, transformations, as, previously, presented, and, rewriting, in, matrix, form, the, lorentz, boost, in, the, x, direction, may, be, written, as, and, the, inverse, lorentz, boost, in, the, x, direction, may, be, written, as, in, other, words, lorentz, boosts, represent, hyperbolic, rotations, in, minkowski, spacetime, 96, 99, the, advantages, of, using, hyperbolic, functions, are, such, that, some, textbooks, such, as, the, classic, ones, by, taylor, and, wheeler, introduce, their, use, at, a, very, early, stage, four, vectors, have, been, mentioned, above, in, context, of, the, energy, momentum, 4, vector, but, without, any, great, emphasis, indeed, none, of, the, elementary, derivations, of, special, relativity, require, them, but, once, understood, 4, vectors, and, more, generally, tensors, greatly, simplify, the, mathematics, and, conceptual, understanding, of, special, relativity, working, exclusively, with, such, objects, leads, to, formulas, that, are, manifestly, relativistically, invariant, which, is, a, considerable, advantage, in, non, trivial, contexts, for, instance, demonstrating, relativistic, invariance, of, maxwell, s, equations, in, their, usual, form, is, not, trivial, while, it, is, merely, a, routine, calculation, really, no, more, than, an, observation, using, the, field, strength, tensor, formulation, on, the, other, hand, general, relativity, from, the, outset, relies, heavily, on, 4, vectors, and, more, generally, tensors, representing, physically, relevant, entities, relating, these, via, equations, that, do, not, rely, on, specific, coordinates, requires, tensors, capable, of, connecting, such, 4, vectors, even, within, a, curved, spacetime, and, not, just, within, a, flat, one, as, in, special, relativity, the, study, of, tensors, is, outside, the, scope, of, this, article, which, provides, only, a, basic, discussion, of, spacetime, a, 4, tuple, a, a, 0, a, 1, a, 2, a, 3, displaystyle, a, left, a, 0, a, 1, a, 2, a, 3, right, is, a, 4, vector, if, its, component, a, i, transform, between, frames, according, to, the, lorentz, transformation, if, using, c, t, x, y, z, displaystyle, ct, x, y, z, coordinates, a, is, a, 4, vector, if, it, transforms, in, the, x, direction, according, to, which, comes, from, simply, replacing, ct, with, a, 0, and, x, with, a, 1, in, the, earlier, presentation, of, the, lorentz, transformation, as, usual, when, we, write, x, t, etc, we, generally, mean, x, t, etc, the, last, three, components, of, a, 4, vector, must, be, a, standard, vector, in, three, dimensional, space, therefore, a, 4, vector, must, transform, like, c, t, x, y, z, displaystyle, c, delta, t, delta, x, delta, y, delta, z, under, lorentz, transformations, as, well, as, rotations, 36, 59, as, expected, the, final, components, of, the, above, 4, vectors, are, all, standard, 3, vectors, corresponding, to, spatial, 3, momentum, 3, force, etc, 178, 181, 36, 59, the, first, postulate, of, special, relativity, declares, the, equivalency, of, all, inertial, frames, a, physical, law, holding, in, one, frame, must, apply, in, all, frames, since, otherwise, it, would, be, possible, to, differentiate, between, frames, newtonian, momenta, fail, to, behave, properly, under, lorentzian, transformation, and, einstein, preferred, to, change, the, definition, of, momentum, to, one, involving, 4, vectors, rather, than, give, up, on, conservation, of, momentum, physical, laws, must, be, based, on, constructs, that, are, frame, independent, this, means, that, physical, laws, may, take, the, form, of, equations, connecting, scalars, which, are, always, frame, independent, however, equations, involving, 4, vectors, require, the, use, of, tensors, with, appropriate, rank, which, themselves, can, be, thought, of, as, being, built, up, from, 4, vectors, 186, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, special, relativity, is, applicable, only, to, inertial, frames, and, that, it, is, unable, to, handle, accelerating, objects, or, accelerating, reference, frames, actually, accelerating, objects, can, generally, be, analyzed, without, needing, to, deal, with, accelerating, frames, at, all, it, is, only, when, gravitation, is, significant, that, general, relativity, is, required, properly, handling, accelerating, frames, does, require, some, care, however, the, difference, between, special, and, general, relativity, is, that, 1, in, special, relativity, all, velocities, are, relative, but, acceleration, is, absolute, 2, in, general, relativity, all, motion, is, relative, whether, inertial, accelerating, or, rotating, to, accommodate, this, difference, general, relativity, uses, curved, spacetime, in, this, section, we, analyze, several, scenarios, involving, accelerated, reference, frames, the, dewan, beran, bell, spaceship, paradox, bell, s, spaceship, paradox, is, a, good, example, of, a, problem, where, intuitive, reasoning, unassisted, by, the, geometric, insight, of, the, spacetime, approach, can, lead, to, issues, in, fig, 7, 4, two, identical, spaceships, float, in, space, and, are, at, rest, relative, to, each, other, they, are, connected, by, a, string, which, is, capable, of, only, a, limited, amount, of, stretching, before, breaking, at, a, given, instant, in, our, frame, the, observer, frame, both, spaceships, accelerate, in, the, same, direction, along, the, line, between, them, with, the, same, constant, proper, acceleration, will, the, string, break, when, the, paradox, was, new, and, relatively, unknown, even, professional, physicists, had, difficulty, working, out, the, solution, two, lines, of, reasoning, lead, to, opposite, conclusions, both, arguments, which, are, presented, below, are, flawed, even, though, one, of, them, yields, the, correct, answer, 106, 120, 122, the, problem, with, the, first, argument, is, that, there, is, no, frame, of, the, spaceships, there, cannot, be, because, the, two, spaceships, measure, a, growing, distance, between, the, two, because, there, is, no, common, frame, of, the, spaceships, the, length, of, the, string, is, ill, defined, nevertheless, the, conclusion, is, correct, and, the, argument, is, mostly, right, the, second, argument, however, completely, ignores, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, 106, 120, 122, a, spacetime, diagram, fig, 7, 5, makes, the, correct, solution, to, this, paradox, almost, immediately, evident, two, observers, in, minkowski, spacetime, accelerate, with, constant, magnitude, k, displaystyle, k, acceleration, for, proper, time, displaystyle, sigma, acceleration, and, elapsed, time, measured, by, the, observers, themselves, not, some, inertial, observer, they, are, comoving, and, inertial, before, and, after, this, phase, in, minkowski, geometry, the, length, along, the, line, of, simultaneity, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, turns, out, to, be, greater, than, the, length, along, the, line, of, simultaneity, a, b, displaystyle, ab, the, length, increase, can, be, calculated, with, the, help, of, the, lorentz, transformation, if, as, illustrated, in, fig, 7, 5, the, acceleration, is, finished, the, ships, will, remain, at, a, constant, offset, in, some, frame, s, displaystyle, s, if, x, a, displaystyle, x, a, and, x, b, x, a, l, displaystyle, x, b, x, a, l, are, the, ships, positions, in, s, displaystyle, s, the, positions, in, frame, s, displaystyle, s, are, the, paradox, as, it, were, comes, from, the, way, that, bell, constructed, his, example, in, the, usual, discussion, of, lorentz, contraction, the, rest, length, is, fixed, and, the, moving, length, shortens, as, measured, in, frame, s, displaystyle, s, as, shown, in, fig, 7, 5, bell, s, example, asserts, the, moving, lengths, a, b, displaystyle, ab, and, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, measured, in, frame, s, displaystyle, s, to, be, fixed, thereby, forcing, the, rest, frame, length, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, in, frame, s, displaystyle, s, to, increase, certain, special, relativity, problem, setups, can, lead, to, insight, about, phenomena, normally, associated, with, general, relativity, such, as, event, horizons, in, the, text, accompanying, section, invariant, hyperbola, of, the, article, spacetime, the, magenta, hyperbolae, represented, actual, paths, that, are, tracked, by, a, constantly, accelerating, traveler, in, spacetime, during, periods, of, positive, acceleration, the, traveler, s, velocity, just, approaches, the, speed, of, light, while, measured, in, our, frame, the, traveler, s, acceleration, constantly, decreases, fig, 7, 6, details, various, features, of, the, traveler, s, motions, with, more, specificity, at, any, given, moment, her, space, axis, is, formed, by, a, line, passing, through, the, origin, and, her, current, position, on, the, hyperbola, while, her, time, axis, is, the, tangent, to, the, hyperbola, at, her, position, the, velocity, parameter, displaystyle, beta, approaches, a, limit, of, one, as, c, t, displaystyle, ct, increases, likewise, displaystyle, gamma, approaches, infinity, the, shape, of, the, invariant, hyperbola, corresponds, to, a, path, of, constant, proper, acceleration, this, is, demonstrable, as, follows, fig, 7, 6, illustrates, a, specific, calculated, scenario, terence, a, and, stella, b, initially, stand, together, 100, light, hours, from, the, origin, stella, lifts, off, at, time, 0, her, spacecraft, accelerating, at, 0, 01, c, per, hour, every, twenty, hours, terence, radios, updates, to, stella, about, the, situation, at, home, solid, green, lines, stella, receives, these, regular, transmissions, but, the, increasing, distance, offset, in, part, by, time, dilation, causes, her, to, receive, terence, s, communications, later, and, later, as, measured, on, her, clock, and, she, never, receives, any, communications, from, terence, after, 100, hours, on, his, clock, dashed, green, lines, 110, 113, after, 100, hours, according, to, terence, s, clock, stella, enters, a, dark, region, she, has, traveled, outside, terence, s, timelike, future, on, the, other, hand, terence, can, continue, to, receive, stella, s, messages, to, him, indefinitely, he, just, has, to, wait, long, enough, spacetime, has, been, divided, into, distinct, regions, separated, by, an, apparent, event, horizon, so, long, as, stella, continues, to, accelerate, she, can, never, know, what, takes, place, behind, this, horizon, 110, 113, theoretical, investigation, in, classical, electromagnetism, led, to, the, discovery, of, wave, propagation, equations, generalizing, the, electromagnetic, effects, found, that, finite, propagation, speed, of, the, e, and, b, fields, required, certain, behaviors, on, charged, particles, the, general, study, of, moving, charges, forms, the, li, nard, wiechert, potential, which, is, a, step, towards, special, relativity, the, lorentz, transformation, of, the, electric, field, of, a, moving, charge, into, a, non, moving, observer, s, reference, frame, results, in, the, appearance, of, a, mathematical, term, commonly, called, the, magnetic, field, conversely, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, a, moving, charge, disappears, and, becomes, a, purely, electrostatic, field, in, a, comoving, frame, of, reference, maxwell, s, equations, are, thus, simply, an, empirical, fit, to, special, relativistic, effects, in, a, classical, model, of, the, universe, as, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, reference, frame, dependent, and, thus, intertwined, one, speaks, of, electromagnetic, fields, special, relativity, provides, the, transformation, rules, for, how, an, electromagnetic, field, in, one, inertial, frame, appears, in, another, inertial, frame, maxwell, s, equations, in, the, 3d, form, are, already, consistent, with, the, physical, content, of, special, relativity, although, they, are, easier, to, manipulate, in, a, manifestly, covariant, form, that, is, in, the, language, of, tensor, calculus, special, relativity, can, be, combined, with, quantum, mechanics, to, form, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, electrodynamics, how, general, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, can, be, unified, is, one, of, the, unsolved, problems, in, physics, quantum, gravity, and, a, theory, of, everything, which, require, a, unification, including, general, relativity, too, are, active, and, ongoing, areas, in, theoretical, research, the, early, bohr, sommerfeld, atomic, model, explained, the, fine, structure, of, alkali, metal, atoms, using, both, special, relativity, and, the, preliminary, knowledge, on, quantum, mechanics, of, the, time, in, 1928, paul, dirac, constructed, an, influential, relativistic, wave, equation, now, known, as, the, dirac, equation, in, his, honour, that, is, fully, compatible, both, with, special, relativity, and, with, the, final, version, of, quantum, theory, existing, after, 1926, this, equation, not, only, described, the, intrinsic, angular, momentum, of, the, electrons, called, spin, it, also, led, to, the, prediction, of, the, antiparticle, of, the, electron, the, positron, and, fine, structure, could, only, be, fully, explained, with, special, relativity, it, was, the, first, foundation, of, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, on, the, other, hand, the, existence, of, antiparticles, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, is, not, enough, for, a, more, accurate, and, complete, theory, of, particle, interactions, instead, a, theory, of, particles, interpreted, as, quantized, fields, called, quantum, field, theory, becomes, necessary, in, which, particles, can, be, created, and, destroyed, throughout, space, and, time, special, relativity, in, its, minkowski, spacetime, is, accurate, only, when, the, absolute, value, of, the, gravitational, potential, is, much, less, than, c, 2, in, the, region, of, interest, in, a, strong, gravitational, field, one, must, use, general, relativity, general, relativity, becomes, special, relativity, at, the, limit, of, a, weak, field, at, very, small, scales, such, as, at, the, planck, length, and, below, quantum, effects, must, be, taken, into, consideration, resulting, in, quantum, gravity, but, at, macroscopic, scales, and, in, the, absence, of, strong, gravitational, fields, special, relativity, is, experimentally, tested, to, extremely, high, degree, of, accuracy, 10, 20, and, thus, accepted, by, the, physics, community, experimental, results, which, appear, to, contradict, it, are, not, reproducible, and, are, thus, widely, believed, to, be, due, to, experimental, errors, special, relativity, is, mathematically, self, consistent, and, it, is, an, organic, part, of, all, modern, physical, theories, most, notably, quantum, field, theory, string, theory, and, general, relativity, in, the, limiting, case, of, negligible, gravitational, fields, newtonian, mechanics, mathematically, follows, from, special, relativity, at, small, velocities, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, thus, newtonian, mechanics, can, be, considered, as, a, special, relativity, of, slow, moving, bodies, see, classical, mechanics, for, a, more, detailed, discussion, several, experiments, predating, einstein, s, 1905, paper, are, now, interpreted, as, evidence, for, relativity, of, these, it, is, known, einstein, was, aware, of, the, fizeau, experiment, before, 1905, and, historians, have, concluded, that, einstein, was, at, least, aware, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, as, early, as, 1899, despite, claims, he, made, in, his, later, years, that, it, played, no, role, in, his, development, of, the, theory, particle, accelerators, accelerate, and, measure, the, properties, of, particles, moving, at, near, the, speed, of, light, where, their, behavior, is, consistent, with, relativity, theory, and, inconsistent, with, the, earlier, newtonian, mechanics, these, machines, would, simply, not, work, if, they, were, not, engineered, according, to, relativistic, principles, in, addition, a, considerable, number, of, modern, experiments, have, been, conducted, to, test, special, relativity, some, examples, special, relativity, uses, a, flat, 4, dimensional, minkowski, space, an, example, of, a, spacetime, minkowski, spacetime, appears, to, be, very, similar, to, the, standard, 3, dimensional, euclidean, space, but, there, is, a, crucial, difference, with, respect, to, time, in, 3d, space, the, differential, of, distance, line, element, ds, is, defined, by, d, s, 2, d, x, d, x, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, d, x, 3, 2, displaystyle, ds, 2, d, mathbf, x, cdot, d, mathbf, x, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, dx, 3, 2, where, d, x, dx, 1, dx, 2, dx, 3, are, the, differentials, of, the, three, spatial, dimensions, in, minkowski, geometry, there, is, an, extra, dimension, with, coordinate, x, 0, derived, from, time, such, that, the, distance, differential, fulfills, d, s, 2, d, x, 0, 2, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, d, x, 3, 2, displaystyle, ds, 2, dx, 0, 2, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, dx, 3, 2, where, d, x, dx, 0, dx, 1, dx, 2, dx, 3, are, the, differentials, of, the, four, spacetime, dimensions, this, suggests, a, deep, theoretical, insight, special, relativity, is, simply, a, rotational, symmetry, of, our, spacetime, analogous, to, the, rotational, symmetry, of, euclidean, space, see, fig, 10, 1, just, as, euclidean, space, uses, a, euclidean, metric, so, spacetime, uses, a, minkowski, metric, basically, special, relativity, can, be, stated, as, the, invariance, of, any, spacetime, interval, that, is, the, 4d, distance, between, any, two, events, when, viewed, from, any, inertial, reference, frame, all, equations, and, effects, of, special, relativity, can, be, derived, from, this, rotational, symmetry, the, poincar, group, of, minkowski, spacetime, the, actual, form, of, ds, above, depends, on, the, metric, and, on, the, choices, for, the, x, 0, coordinate, to, make, the, time, coordinate, look, like, the, space, coordinates, it, can, be, treated, as, imaginary, x, 0, ict, this, is, called, a, wick, rotation, according, to, misner, thorne, and, wheeler, 1971, 2, 3, ultimately, the, deeper, understanding, of, both, special, and, general, relativity, will, come, from, the, study, of, the, minkowski, metric, described, below, and, to, take, x, 0, ct, rather, than, a, disguised, euclidean, metric, using, ict, as, the, time, coordinate, some, authors, use, x, 0, t, with, factors, of, c, elsewhere, to, compensate, for, instance, spatial, coordinates, are, divided, by, c, or, factors, of, c, 2, are, included, in, the, metric, tensor, these, numerous, conventions, can, be, superseded, by, using, natural, units, where, c, 1, then, space, and, time, have, equivalent, units, and, no, factors, of, c, appear, anywhere, if, we, reduce, the, spatial, dimensions, to, 2, so, that, we, can, represent, the, physics, in, a, 3d, space, d, s, 2, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, c, 2, d, t, 2, displaystyle, ds, 2, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, c, 2, dt, 2, we, see, that, the, null, geodesics, lie, along, a, dual, cone, see, fig, 10, 2, defined, by, the, equation, d, s, 2, 0, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, c, 2, d, t, 2, displaystyle, ds, 2, 0, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, c, 2, dt, 2, or, simply, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, c, 2, d, t, 2, displaystyle, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, c, 2, dt, 2, which, is, the, equation, of, a, circle, of, radius, c, dt, if, we, extend, this, to, three, spatial, dimensions, the, null, geodesics, are, the, 4, dimensional, cone, d, s, 2, 0, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, d, x, 3, 2, c, 2, d, t, 2, displaystyle, ds, 2, 0, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, dx, 3, 2, c, 2, dt, 2, so, d, x, 1, 2, d, x, 2, 2, d, x, 3, 2, c, 2, d, t, 2, displaystyle, dx, 1, 2, dx, 2, 2, dx, 3, 2, c, 2, dt, 2, as, illustrated, in, fig, 10, 3, the, null, geodesics, can, be, visualized, as, a, set, of, continuous, concentric, spheres, with, radii, c, dt, this, null, dual, cone, represents, the, line, of, sight, of, a, point, in, space, that, is, when, we, look, at, the, stars, and, say, the, light, from, that, star, which, i, am, receiving, is, x, years, old, we, are, looking, down, this, line, of, sight, a, null, geodesic, we, are, looking, at, an, event, a, distance, d, x, 1, 2, x, 2, 2, x, 3, 2, textstyle, d, sqrt, x, 1, 2, x, 2, 2, x, 3, 2, away, and, a, time, d, c, in, the, past, for, this, reason, the, null, dual, cone, is, also, known, as, the, light, cone, the, point, in, the, lower, left, of, the, fig, 10, 2, represents, the, star, the, origin, represents, the, observer, and, the, line, represents, the, null, geodesic, line, of, sight, the, cone, in, the, t, region, is, the, information, that, the, point, is, receiving, while, the, cone, in, the, t, section, is, the, information, that, the, point, is, sending, the, geometry, of, minkowski, space, can, be, depicted, using, minkowski, diagrams, which, are, useful, also, in, understanding, many, of, the, thought, experiments, in, special, relativity, above, the, lorentz, transformation, for, the, time, coordinate, and, three, space, coordinates, illustrates, that, they, are, intertwined, this, is, true, more, generally, certain, pairs, of, timelike, and, spacelike, quantities, naturally, combine, on, equal, footing, under, the, same, lorentz, transformation, the, lorentz, transformation, in, standard, configuration, above, that, is, for, a, boost, in, the, x, direction, can, be, recast, into, matrix, form, as, follows, c, t, x, y, z, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, c, t, x, y, z, c, t, x, x, c, t, y, z, displaystyle, begin, pmatrix, ct, x, y, z, end, pmatrix, begin, pmatrix, gamma, beta, gamma, 0, 0, beta, gamma, gamma, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, end, pmatrix, begin, pmatrix, ct, x, y, z, end, pmatrix, begin, pmatrix, gamma, ct, gamma, beta, x, gamma, x, beta, gamma, ct, y, z, end, pmatrix, in, newtonian, mechanics, quantities, that, have, magnitude, and, direction, are, mathematically, described, as, 3d, vectors, in, euclidean, space, and, in, general, they, are, parametrized, by, time, in, special, relativity, this, notion, is, extended, by, adding, the, appropriate, timelike, quantity, to, a, spacelike, vector, quantity, and, we, have, 4d, vectors, or, four, vectors, in, minkowski, spacetime, the, components, of, vectors, are, written, using, tensor, index, notation, as, this, has, numerous, advantages, the, notation, makes, it, clear, the, equations, are, manifestly, covariant, under, the, poincar, group, thus, bypassing, the, tedious, calculations, to, check, this, fact, in, constructing, such, equations, we, often, find, that, equations, previously, thought, to, be, unrelated, are, in, fact, closely, connected, being, part, of, the, same, tensor, equation, recognizing, other, physical, quantities, as, tensors, simplifies, their, transformation, laws, throughout, upper, indices, superscripts, are, contravariant, indices, rather, than, exponents, except, when, they, indicate, a, square, this, should, be, clear, from, the, context, and, lower, indices, subscripts, are, covariant, indices, for, simplicity, and, consistency, with, the, earlier, equations, cartesian, coordinates, will, be, used, the, simplest, example, of, a, four, vector, is, the, position, of, an, event, in, spacetime, which, constitutes, a, timelike, component, ct, and, spacelike, component, x, x, y, z, in, a, contravariant, position, four, vector, with, components, x, x, 0, x, 1, x, 2, x, 3, c, t, x, y, z, c, t, x, displaystyle, x, nu, x, 0, x, 1, x, 2, x, 3, ct, x, y, z, ct, mathbf, x, where, we, define, x, 0, ct, so, that, the, time, coordinate, has, the, same, dimension, of, distance, as, the, other, spatial, dimensions, so, that, space, and, time, are, treated, equally, now, the, transformation, of, the, contravariant, components, of, the, position, 4, vector, can, be, compactly, written, as, x, x, displaystyle, x, mu, lambda, mu, nu, x, nu, where, there, is, an, implied, summation, on, displaystyle, nu, from, 0, to, 3, and, displaystyle, lambda, mu, nu, is, a, matrix, more, generally, all,

to, their, non, linearity, on, the, other, hand, the, transformation, of, four, velocity, and, four, acceleration, are, simpler, by, means, of, the, lorentz, transformation, matrix, the, four,

are, the, classical, angular, momentum, and, the, other, three, are, related, to, the, boost, of, the, center, of, mass, of, the, system, the, derivative, of, the, relativistic, angular, momentum, with, respect, to, proper, time, is, the, relativistic, torque, also, second, order, antisymmetric, tensor, the, electromagnetic, field, tensor, is, another, second, order, antisymmetric, tensor, field, with, six, components, three, for, the, electric, field, and, another, three, for, the, magnetic, field, there, is, also, the, stress, energy, tensor, for, the, electromagnetic, field, namely, the, electromagnetic, stress, energy, tensor, the, metric, tensor, allows, one, to, define, the, inner, product, of, two, vectors, which, in, turn, allows, one, to, assign, a, magnitude, to, the, vector, given, the, four, dimensional, nature, of, spacetime, the, minkowski, metric, has, components, valid, with, suitably, chosen, coordinates, which, can, be, arranged, in, a, 4, 4, matrix, 1, 0,

displaystyle, eta, alpha, beta, in, those, frames, throughout, we, use, the, signs, as, above, different, authors, use, different, conventions, see, minkowski, metric, alternative, signs, the, poincar, group, is, the, most, general, group, of, transformations, which, preserves, the, minkowski, metric, displaystyle, eta, alpha, beta, eta, mu, nu, lambda, mu, alpha, lambda, nu, beta, and, this, is, the, physical, symmetry, underlying, special, relativity, the, metric, can, be, used, for, raising, and, lowering, indices, on, vectors, and, tensors, invariants, can, be, constructed, using, the, metric, the, inner, product, of, a, 4, vector, t, with, another, 4, vector, s, is, t, s, t, s, t, s, invariant, scalar, displaystyle, t, alpha, s, alpha, t, alpha, eta, alpha, beta, s, beta, t, alpha, eta, alpha, beta, s, beta, text, invariant, scalar, invariant, means, that, it, takes, the, same, value, in, all, inertial, frames, because, it, is, a, scalar, 0, rank, tensor, and, so, no, appears, in, its, trivial, transformation, the, magnitude, of, the, 4, vector, t, is, the, positive, square, root, of, the, inner, product, with, itself, t, t, t, displaystyle, mathbf, t, sqrt, t, alpha, t, alpha, one, can, extend, this, idea, to, tensors, of, higher, order, for, a, second, order, tensor, we, can, form, the, invariants, t, t, t, t, t, t, invariant, scalars, displaystyle, t, alpha, alpha, t, alpha, beta, t, beta, alpha, t, alpha, beta, t, beta, gamma, t, gamma, alpha, text, invariant, scalars, similarly, for, higher, order, tensors, invariant, expressions, particularly, inner, products, of, 4, vectors, with, themselves, provide, equations, that, are, useful, for, calculations, because, one, does, not, need, to, perform, lorentz, transformations, to, determine, the, invariants, the, coordinate, differentials, transform, also, contravariantly, d, x, d, x, displaystyle, dx, mu, lambda, mu, nu, dx, nu, so, the, squared, length, of, the, differential, of, the, position, four, vector, dx, constructed, using, d, x, 2, d, x, d, x, d, x, d, x, c, d, t, 2, d, x, 2, d, y, 2, d, z, 2, displaystyle, d, mathbf, x, 2, dx, mu, dx, mu, eta, mu, nu, dx, mu, dx, nu, c, dt, 2, dx, 2, dy, 2, dz, 2, is, an, invariant, notice, that, when, the, line, element, d, x, 2, is, negative, that, d, x, 2, is, the, differential, of, proper, time, while, when, d, x, 2, is, positive, d, x, 2, is, differential, of, the, proper, distance, the, 4, velocity, u, has, an, invariant, form, u, 2, u, u, c, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, u, 2, eta, nu, mu, u, nu, u, mu, c, 2, which, means, all, velocity, four, vectors, have, a, magnitude, of, c, this, is, an, expression, of, the, fact, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, being, at, coordinate, rest, in, relativity, at, the, least, you, are, always, moving, forward, through, time, differentiating, the, above, equation, by, produces, 2, a, u, 0, displaystyle, 2, eta, mu, nu, a, mu, u, nu, 0, so, in, special, relativity, the, acceleration, four, vector, and, the, velocity, four, vector, are, orthogonal, the, invariant, magnitude, of, the, momentum, 4, vector, generates, the, energy, momentum, relation, p, 2, p, p, e, c, 2, p, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 2, eta, mu, nu, p, mu, p, nu, left, frac, e, c, right, 2, p, 2, we, can, work, out, what, this, invariant, is, by, first, arguing, that, since, it, is, a, scalar, it, does, not, matter, in, which, reference, frame, we, calculate, it, and, then, by, transforming, to, a, frame, where, the, total, momentum, is, zero, p, 2, e, rest, c, 2, m, c, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 2, left, frac, e, text, rest, c, right, 2, mc, 2, we, see, that, the, rest, energy, is, an, independent, invariant, a, rest, energy, can, be, calculated, even, for, particles, and, systems, in, motion, by, translating, to, a, frame, in, which, momentum, is, zero, the, rest, energy, is, related, to, the, mass, according, to, the, celebrated, equation, discussed, above, e, rest, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, text, rest, mc, 2, the, mass, of, systems, measured, in, their, center, of, momentum, frame, where, total, momentum, is, zero, is, given, by, the, total, energy, of, the, system, in, this, frame, it, may, not, be, equal, to, the, sum, of, individual, system, masses, measured, in, other, frames, to, use, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, both, forces, must, be, defined, as, the, rate, of, change, of, momentum, with, respect, to, the, same, time, coordinate, that, is, it, requires, the, 3d, force, defined, above, unfortunately, there, is, no, tensor, in, 4d, which, contains, the, components, of, the, 3d, force, vector, among, its, components, if, a, particle, is, not, traveling, at, c, one, can, transform, the, 3d, force, from, the, particle, s, co, moving, reference, frame, into, the, observer, s, reference, frame, this, yields, a, 4, vector, called, the, four, force, it, is, the, rate, of, change, of, the, above, energy, momentum, four, vector, with, respect, to, proper, time, the, covariant, version, of, the, four, force, is, f, d, p, d, m, a, displaystyle, f, nu, frac, dp, nu, d, tau, ma, nu, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, object, the, time, component, of, the, four, force, is, zero, unless, the, invariant, mass, of, the, object, is, changing, this, requires, a, non, closed, system, in, which, energy, mass, is, being, directly, added, or, removed, from, the, object, in, which, case, it, is, the, negative, of, that, rate, of, change, of, mass, times, c, in, general, though, the, components, of, the, four, force, are, not, equal, to, the, components, of, the, three, force, because, the, three, force, is, defined, by, the, rate, of, change, of, momentum, with, respect, to, coordinate, time, that, is, dp, dt, while, the, four, force, is, defined, by, the, rate, of, change, of, momentum, with, respect, to, proper, time, that, is, dp, d, in, a, continuous, medium, the, 3d, density, of, force, combines, with, the, density, of, power, to, form, a, covariant, 4, vector, the, spatial, part, is, the, result, of, dividing, the, force, on, a, small, cell, in, 3, space, by, the, volume, of, that, cell, the, time, component, is, 1, c, times, the, power, transferred, to, that, cell, divided, by, the, volume, of, the, cell, this, will, be, used, below, in, the, section, on, electromagnetism
