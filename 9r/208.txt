a, dwarf, galaxy, is, a, small, galaxy, composed, of, about, 1000, up, to, several, billion, stars, as, compared, to, the, milky, way, s, 200, 400, billion, stars, the, large, magellanic, cloud, which, closely, orbits, the, milky, way, and, contains, over, 30, billion, stars, is, sometimes, classified, as, a, dwarf, galaxy, others, consider, it, a, full, fledged, galaxy, dwarf, galaxies, formation, and, activity, are, thought, to, be, heavily, influenced, by, interactions, with, larger, galaxies, astronomers, identify, numerous, types, of, dwarf, galaxies, based, on, their, shape, and, composition, one, theory, states, that, most, galaxies, including, dwarf, galaxies, form, in, association, with, dark, matter, or, from, gas, that, contains, metals, however, nasa, s, galaxy, evolution, explorer, space, probe, identified, new, dwarf, galaxies, forming, out, of, gases, with, low, metallicity, these, galaxies, were, located, in, the, leo, ring, a, cloud, of, hydrogen, and, helium, around, two, massive, galaxies, in, the, constellation, leo, because, of, their, small, size, dwarf, galaxies, have, been, observed, being, pulled, toward, and, ripped, by, neighbouring, spiral, galaxies, resulting, in, stellar, streams, and, eventually, galaxy, merger, there, are, many, dwarf, galaxies, in, the, local, group, these, small, galaxies, frequently, orbit, larger, galaxies, such, as, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, the, triangulum, galaxy, a, 2007, paper, has, suggested, that, many, dwarf, galaxies, were, created, by, galactic, tides, during, the, early, evolutions, of, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, tidal, dwarf, galaxies, are, produced, when, galaxies, collide, and, their, gravitational, masses, interact, streams, of, galactic, material, are, pulled, away, from, the, parent, galaxies, and, the, halos, of, dark, matter, that, surround, them, a, 2018, study, suggests, that, some, local, dwarf, galaxies, formed, extremely, early, during, the, dark, ages, within, the, first, billion, years, after, the, big, bang, more, than, 20, known, dwarf, galaxies, orbit, the, milky, way, and, recent, observations, have, also, led, astronomers, to, believe, the, largest, globular, cluster, in, the, milky, way, omega, centauri, is, in, fact, the, core, of, a, dwarf, galaxy, with, a, black, hole, at, its, centre, which, was, at, some, time, absorbed, by, the, milky, way, in, astronomy, a, blue, compact, dwarf, galaxy, bcd, galaxy, is, a, small, galaxy, which, contains, large, clusters, of, young, hot, massive, stars, these, stars, the, brightest, of, which, are, blue, cause, the, galaxy, itself, to, appear, blue, in, colour, most, bcd, galaxies, are, also, classified, as, dwarf, irregular, galaxies, or, as, dwarf, lenticular, galaxies, because, they, are, composed, of, star, clusters, bcd, galaxies, lack, a, uniform, shape, they, consume, gas, intensely, which, causes, their, stars, to, become, very, violent, when, forming, bcd, galaxies, cool, in, the, process, of, forming, new, stars, the, galaxies, stars, are, all, formed, at, different, time, periods, so, the, galaxies, have, time, to, cool, and, to, build, up, matter, to, form, new, stars, as, time, passes, this, star, formation, changes, the, shape, of, the, galaxies, nearby, examples, include, ngc, 1705, ngc, 2915, ngc, 3353, and, ugca, 281, ultra, faint, dwarf, galaxies, ufds, are, a, class, of, galaxies, that, contain, from, a, few, hundred, to, one, hundred, thousand, stars, making, them, the, faintest, galaxies, in, the, universe, ufds, resemble, globular, clusters, gcs, in, appearance, but, have, very, different, properties, unlike, gcs, ufds, contain, a, significant, amount, of, dark, matter, and, are, more, extended, ufds, were, first, discovered, with, the, advent, of, digital, sky, surveys, in, 2005, in, particular, with, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, sdss, ufds, are, the, most, dark, matter, dominated, systems, known, astronomers, believe, that, ufds, encode, valuable, information, about, the, early, universe, as, all, ufds, discovered, so, far, are, ancient, systems, that, have, likely, formed, very, early, on, only, a, few, million, years, after, the, big, bang, and, before, the, epoch, of, reionization, recent, theoretical, work, has, hypothesised, the, existence, of, a, population, of, young, ufds, that, form, at, a, much, later, time, than, the, ancient, ufds, these, galaxies, have, not, been, observed, in, our, universe, so, far, ultra, compact, dwarf, galaxies, ucd, are, a, class, of, very, compact, galaxies, with, very, high, stellar, densities, discovered, in, the, 2000s, they, are, thought, to, be, on, the, order, of, 200, light, years, across, containing, about, 100, million, stars, it, is, theorised, that, these, are, the, cores, of, nucleated, dwarf, elliptical, galaxies, that, have, been, stripped, of, gas, and, outlying, stars, by, tidal, interactions, travelling, through, the, hearts, of, rich, clusters, ucds, have, been, found, in, the, virgo, cluster, fornax, cluster, abell, 1689, and, the, coma, cluster, amongst, others, in, particular, an, unprecedentedly, large, sample, of, 100, ucds, has, been, found, in, the, core, region, of, the, virgo, cluster, by, the, next, generation, virgo, cluster, survey, team, the, first, ever, relatively, robust, studies, of, the, global, properties, of, virgo, ucds, suggest, that, ucds, have, distinct, dynamical, and, structural, properties, from, normal, globular, clusters, an, extreme, example, of, ucd, is, m60, ucd1, about, 54, million, light, years, away, which, contains, approximately, 200, million, solar, masses, within, a, 160, light, year, radius, the, stars, in, its, central, region, are, packed, 25, times, more, densely, than, stars, in, earth, s, region, in, the, milky, way, m59, ucd3, is, approximately, the, same, size, as, m60, ucd1, with, a, half, light, radius, r, h, of, approximately, 20, parsecs, but, is, 40, more, luminous, with, an, absolute, visual, magnitude, of, approximately, 14, 6, this, makes, m59, ucd3, the, second, densest, known, galaxy, based, on, stellar, orbital, velocities, two, ucd, in, the, virgo, cluster, are, claimed, to, have, supermassive, black, holes, weighing, 13, and, 18, of, the, galaxies, masses
