the, tau, also, called, the, tau, lepton, tau, particle, tauon, or, tau, electron, is, an, elementary, particle, similar, to, the, electron, with, negative, electric, charge, and, a, spin, of, 1, 2, like, the, electron, the, muon, and, the, three, neutrinos, the, tau, is, a, lepton, and, like, all, elementary, particles, with, half, integer, spin, the, tau, has, a, corresponding, antiparticle, of, opposite, charge, but, equal, mass, and, spin, in, the, tau, s, case, this, is, the, antitau, also, called, the, positive, tau, tau, particles, are, denoted, by, the, symbol, and, the, antitaus, by, tau, leptons, have, a, lifetime, of, 2, 9, 10, 13, s, and, a, mass, of, 1, 776, 9, mev, c, 2, compared, to, 105, 66, mev, c, 2, for, muons, and, 0, 511, mev, c, 2, for, electrons, since, their, interactions, are, very, similar, to, those, of, the, electron, a, tau, can, be, thought, of, as, a, much, heavier, version, of, the, electron, because, of, their, greater, mass, tau, particles, do, not, emit, as, much, bremsstrahlung, braking, radiation, as, electrons, consequently, they, are, potentially, much, more, highly, penetrating, than, electrons, because, of, its, short, lifetime, the, range, of, the, tau, is, mainly, set, by, its, decay, length, which, is, too, small, for, bremsstrahlung, to, be, noticeable, its, penetrating, power, appears, only, at, ultra, high, velocity, and, energy, above, petaelectronvolt, energies, when, time, dilation, extends, its, otherwise, very, short, path, length, as, with, the, case, of, the, other, charged, leptons, the, tau, has, an, associated, tau, neutrino, denoted, by, the, search, for, tau, started, in, 1960, at, cern, by, the, bologna, cern, frascati, bcf, group, led, by, antonino, zichichi, zichichi, came, up, with, the, idea, of, a, new, sequential, heavy, lepton, now, called, tau, and, invented, a, method, of, search, he, performed, the, experiment, at, the, adone, facility, in, 1969, once, its, accelerator, became, operational, however, the, accelerator, he, used, did, not, have, enough, energy, to, search, for, the, tau, particle, the, tau, was, independently, anticipated, in, a, 1971, article, by, yung, su, tsai, providing, the, theory, for, this, discovery, the, tau, was, detected, in, a, series, of, experiments, between, 1974, and, 1977, by, martin, lewis, perl, with, his, and, tsai, s, colleagues, at, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, center, slac, and, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, lbl, group, their, equipment, consisted, of, slac, s, then, new, electron, positron, colliding, ring, called, spear, and, the, lbl, magnetic, detector, they, could, detect, and, distinguish, between, leptons, hadrons, and, photons, they, did, not, detect, the, tau, directly, but, rather, discovered, anomalous, events, we, have, discovered, 64, events, of, the, form, for, which, we, have, no, conventional, explanation, the, need, for, at, least, two, undetected, particles, was, shown, by, the, inability, to, conserve, energy, and, momentum, with, only, one, however, no, other, muons, electrons, photons, or, hadrons, were, detected, it, was, proposed, that, this, event, was, the, production, and, subsequent, decay, of, a, new, particle, pair, this, was, difficult, to, verify, because, the, energy, to, produce, the, pair, is, similar, to, the, threshold, for, d, meson, production, the, mass, and, spin, of, the, tau, were, subsequently, established, by, work, done, at, desy, hamburg, with, the, double, arm, spectrometer, dasp, and, at, slac, stanford, with, the, spear, direct, electron, counter, delco, the, symbol, was, derived, from, the, greek, triton, meaning, third, in, english, since, it, was, the, third, charged, lepton, discovered, martin, lewis, perl, shared, the, 1995, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, frederick, reines, the, latter, was, awarded, his, share, of, the, prize, for, the, experimental, discovery, of, the, neutrino, the, tau, is, the, only, lepton, that, can, decay, into, hadrons, the, masses, of, other, leptons, are, too, small, like, the, leptonic, decay, modes, of, the, tau, the, hadronic, decay, is, through, the, weak, interaction, the, branching, fractions, of, the, dominant, hadronic, tau, decays, are, in, total, the, tau, lepton, will, decay, hadronically, approximately, 64, 79, of, the, time, the, branching, fractions, of, the, common, purely, leptonic, tau, decays, are, the, similarity, of, values, of, the, two, branching, fractions, is, a, consequence, of, lepton, universality, the, tau, lepton, is, predicted, to, form, exotic, atoms, like, other, charged, subatomic, particles, one, of, such, consists, of, an, antitau, and, an, electron, e, called, tauonium, another, one, is, an, onium, atom, called, ditauonium, or, true, tauonium, which, is, a, challenge, to, detect, due, to, the, difficulty, to, form, it, from, two, opposite, sign, short, lived, tau, leptons, its, experimental, detection, would, be, an, interesting, test, of, quantum, electrodynamics
