in, thermodynamics, a, critical, point, or, critical, state, is, the, end, point, of, a, phase, equilibrium, curve, one, example, is, the, liquid, vapor, critical, point, the, end, point, of, the, pressure, temperature, curve, that, designates, conditions, under, which, a, liquid, and, its, vapor, can, coexist, at, higher, temperatures, the, gas, comes, into, a, supercritical, phase, and, so, cannot, be, liquefied, by, pressure, alone, at, the, critical, point, defined, by, a, critical, temperature, t, c, and, a, critical, pressure, p, c, phase, boundaries, vanish, other, examples, include, the, liquid, liquid, critical, points, in, mixtures, and, the, ferromagnet, paramagnet, transition, curie, temperature, in, the, absence, of, an, external, magnetic, field, for, simplicity, and, clarity, the, generic, notion, of, critical, point, is, best, introduced, by, discussing, a, specific, example, the, vapor, liquid, critical, point, this, was, the, first, critical, point, to, be, discovered, and, it, is, still, the, best, known, and, most, studied, one, the, figure, shows, the, schematic, p, t, diagram, of, a, pure, substance, as, opposed, to, mixtures, which, have, additional, state, variables, and, richer, phase, diagrams, discussed, below, the, commonly, known, phases, solid, liquid, and, vapor, are, separated, by, phase, boundaries, i, e, pressure, temperature, combinations, where, two, phases, can, coexist, at, the, triple, point, all, three, phases, can, coexist, however, the, liquid, vapor, boundary, terminates, in, an, endpoint, at, some, critical, temperature, t, c, and, critical, pressure, p, c, this, is, the, critical, point, the, critical, point, of, water, occurs, at, 647, 096, k, 373, 946, c, 705, 103, f, and, 22, 064, megapascals, 3, 200, 1, psi, 217, 75, atm, 220, 64, bar, in, the, vicinity, of, the, critical, point, the, physical, properties, of, the, liquid, and, the, vapor, change, dramatically, with, both, phases, becoming, even, more, similar, for, instance, liquid, water, under, normal, conditions, is, nearly, incompressible, has, a, low, thermal, expansion, coefficient, has, a, high, dielectric, constant, and, is, an, excellent, solvent, for, electrolytes, near, the, critical, point, all, these, properties, change, into, the, exact, opposite, water, becomes, compressible, expandable, a, poor, dielectric, a, bad, solvent, for, electrolytes, and, mixes, more, readily, with, nonpolar, gases, and, organic, molecules, at, the, critical, point, only, one, phase, exists, the, heat, of, vaporization, is, zero, there, is, a, stationary, inflection, point, in, the, constant, temperature, line, critical, isotherm, on, a, pv, diagram, this, means, that, at, the, critical, point, above, the, critical, point, there, exists, a, state, of, matter, that, is, continuously, connected, with, can, be, transformed, without, phase, transition, into, both, the, liquid, and, the, gaseous, state, it, is, called, supercritical, fluid, the, common, textbook, knowledge, that, all, distinction, between, liquid, and, vapor, disappears, beyond, the, critical, point, has, been, challenged, by, fisher, and, widom, who, identified, a, p, t, line, that, separates, states, with, different, asymptotic, statistical, properties, fisher, widom, line, sometimes, the, critical, point, does, not, manifest, in, most, thermodynamic, or, mechanical, properties, but, is, hidden, and, reveals, itself, in, the, onset, of, inhomogeneities, in, elastic, moduli, marked, changes, in, the, appearance, and, local, properties, of, non, affine, droplets, and, a, sudden, enhancement, in, defect, pair, concentration, the, existence, of, a, critical, point, was, first, discovered, by, charles, cagniard, de, la, tour, in, 1822, and, named, by, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1860, and, thomas, andrews, in, 1869, cagniard, showed, that, co, 2, could, be, liquefied, at, 31, c, at, a, pressure, of, 73, atm, but, not, at, a, slightly, higher, temperature, even, under, pressures, as, high, as, 3000, atm, solving, the, above, condition, p, v, t, 0, displaystyle, partial, p, partial, v, t, 0, for, the, van, der, waals, equation, one, can, compute, the, critical, point, as, however, the, van, der, waals, equation, based, on, a, mean, field, theory, does, not, hold, near, the, critical, point, in, particular, it, predicts, wrong, scaling, laws, to, analyse, properties, of, fluids, near, the, critical, point, reduced, state, variables, are, sometimes, defined, relative, to, the, critical, properties, the, principle, of, corresponding, states, indicates, that, substances, at, equal, reduced, pressures, and, temperatures, have, equal, reduced, volumes, this, relationship, is, approximately, true, for, many, substances, but, becomes, increasingly, inaccurate, for, large, values, of, p, r, for, some, gases, there, is, an, additional, correction, factor, called, newton, s, correction, added, to, the, critical, temperature, and, critical, pressure, calculated, in, this, manner, these, are, empirically, derived, values, and, vary, with, the, pressure, range, of, interest, the, liquid, liquid, critical, point, of, a, solution, which, occurs, at, the, critical, solution, temperature, occurs, at, the, limit, of, the, two, phase, region, of, the, phase, diagram, in, other, words, it, is, the, point, at, which, an, infinitesimal, change, in, some, thermodynamic, variable, such, as, temperature, or, pressure, leads, to, separation, of, the, mixture, into, two, distinct, liquid, phases, as, shown, in, the, polymer, solvent, phase, diagram, to, the, right, two, types, of, liquid, liquid, critical, points, are, the, upper, critical, solution, temperature, ucst, which, is, the, hottest, point, at, which, cooling, induces, phase, separation, and, the, lower, critical, solution, temperature, lcst, which, is, the, coldest, point, at, which, heating, induces, phase, separation, from, a, theoretical, standpoint, the, liquid, liquid, critical, point, represents, the, temperature, concentration, extremum, of, the, spinodal, curve, as, can, be, seen, in, the, figure, to, the, right, thus, the, liquid, liquid, critical, point, in, a, two, component, system, must, satisfy, two, conditions, the, condition, of, the, spinodal, curve, the, second, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, concentration, must, equal, zero, and, the, extremum, condition, the, third, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, concentration, must, also, equal, zero, or, the, derivative, of, the, spinodal, temperature, with, respect, to, concentration, must, equal, zero
