diffusion, is, the, net, movement, of, anything, for, example, atoms, ions, molecules, energy, generally, from, a, region, of, higher, concentration, to, a, region, of, lower, concentration, diffusion, is, driven, by, a, gradient, in, gibbs, free, energy, or, chemical, potential, it, is, possible, to, diffuse, uphill, from, a, region, of, lower, concentration, to, a, region, of, higher, concentration, as, in, spinodal, decomposition, diffusion, is, a, stochastic, process, due, to, the, inherent, randomness, of, the, diffusing, entity, and, can, be, used, to, model, many, real, life, stochastic, scenarios, therefore, diffusion, and, the, corresponding, mathematical, models, are, used, in, several, fields, beyond, physics, such, as, statistics, probability, theory, information, theory, neural, networks, finance, and, marketing, the, concept, of, diffusion, is, widely, used, in, many, fields, including, physics, particle, diffusion, chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, statistics, data, science, and, finance, diffusion, of, people, ideas, data, and, price, values, the, central, idea, of, diffusion, however, is, common, to, all, of, these, a, substance, or, collection, undergoing, diffusion, spreads, out, from, a, point, or, location, at, which, there, is, a, higher, concentration, of, that, substance, or, collection, a, gradient, is, the, change, in, the, value, of, a, quantity, for, example, concentration, pressure, or, temperature, with, the, change, in, another, variable, usually, distance, a, change, in, concentration, over, a, distance, is, called, a, concentration, gradient, a, change, in, pressure, over, a, distance, is, called, a, pressure, gradient, and, a, change, in, temperature, over, a, distance, is, called, a, temperature, gradient, the, word, diffusion, derives, from, the, latin, word, diffundere, which, means, to, spread, out, a, distinguishing, feature, of, diffusion, is, that, it, depends, on, particle, random, walk, and, results, in, mixing, or, mass, transport, without, requiring, directed, bulk, motion, bulk, motion, or, bulk, flow, is, the, characteristic, of, advection, the, term, convection, is, used, to, describe, the, combination, of, both, transport, phenomena, if, a, diffusion, process, can, be, described, by, fick, s, laws, it, is, called, a, normal, diffusion, or, fickian, diffusion, otherwise, it, is, called, an, anomalous, diffusion, or, non, fickian, diffusion, when, talking, about, the, extent, of, diffusion, two, length, scales, are, used, in, two, different, scenarios, bulk, flow, is, the, movement, flow, of, an, entire, body, due, to, a, pressure, gradient, for, example, water, coming, out, of, a, tap, diffusion, is, the, gradual, movement, dispersion, of, concentration, within, a, body, with, no, net, movement, of, matter, an, example, of, a, process, where, both, bulk, motion, and, diffusion, occur, is, human, breathing, first, there, is, a, bulk, flow, process, the, lungs, are, located, in, the, thoracic, cavity, which, expands, as, the, first, step, in, external, respiration, this, expansion, leads, to, an, increase, in, volume, of, the, alveoli, in, the, lungs, which, causes, a, decrease, in, pressure, in, the, alveoli, this, creates, a, pressure, gradient, between, the, air, outside, the, body, at, relatively, high, pressure, and, the, alveoli, at, relatively, low, pressure, the, air, moves, down, the, pressure, gradient, through, the, airways, of, the, lungs, and, into, the, alveoli, until, the, pressure, of, the, air, and, that, in, the, alveoli, are, equal, that, is, the, movement, of, air, by, bulk, flow, stops, once, there, is, no, longer, a, pressure, gradient, second, there, is, a, diffusion, process, the, air, arriving, in, the, alveoli, has, a, higher, concentration, of, oxygen, than, the, stale, air, in, the, alveoli, the, increase, in, oxygen, concentration, creates, a, concentration, gradient, for, oxygen, between, the, air, in, the, alveoli, and, the, blood, in, the, capillaries, that, surround, the, alveoli, oxygen, then, moves, by, diffusion, down, the, concentration, gradient, into, the, blood, the, other, consequence, of, the, air, arriving, in, alveoli, is, that, the, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, alveoli, decreases, this, creates, a, concentration, gradient, for, carbon, dioxide, to, diffuse, from, the, blood, into, the, alveoli, as, fresh, air, has, a, very, low, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, compared, to, the, blood, in, the, body, third, there, is, another, bulk, flow, process, the, pumping, action, of, the, heart, then, transports, the, blood, around, the, body, as, the, left, ventricle, of, the, heart, contracts, the, volume, decreases, which, increases, the, pressure, in, the, ventricle, this, creates, a, pressure, gradient, between, the, heart, and, the, capillaries, and, blood, moves, through, blood, vessels, by, bulk, flow, down, the, pressure, gradient, there, are, two, ways, to, introduce, the, notion, of, diffusion, either, a, phenomenological, approach, starting, with, fick, s, laws, of, diffusion, and, their, mathematical, consequences, or, a, physical, and, atomistic, one, by, considering, the, random, walk, of, the, diffusing, particles, in, the, phenomenological, approach, diffusion, is, the, movement, of, a, substance, from, a, region, of, high, concentration, to, a, region, of, low, concentration, without, bulk, motion, according, to, fick, s, laws, the, diffusion, flux, is, proportional, to, the, negative, gradient, of, concentrations, it, goes, from, regions, of, higher, concentration, to, regions, of, lower, concentration, sometime, later, various, generalizations, of, fick, s, laws, were, developed, in, the, frame, of, thermodynamics, and, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, from, the, atomistic, point, of, view, diffusion, is, considered, as, a, result, of, the, random, walk, of, the, diffusing, particles, in, molecular, diffusion, the, moving, molecules, in, a, gas, liquid, or, solid, are, self, propelled, by, kinetic, energy, random, walk, of, small, particles, in, suspension, in, a, fluid, was, discovered, in, 1827, by, robert, brown, who, found, that, minute, particle, suspended, in, a, liquid, medium, and, just, large, enough, to, be, visible, under, an, optical, microscope, exhibit, a, rapid, and, continually, irregular, motion, of, particles, known, as, brownian, movement, the, theory, of, the, brownian, motion, and, the, atomistic, backgrounds, of, diffusion, were, developed, by, albert, einstein, the, concept, of, diffusion, is, typically, applied, to, any, subject, matter, involving, random, walks, in, ensembles, of, individuals, in, chemistry, and, materials, science, diffusion, also, refers, to, the, movement, of, fluid, molecules, in, porous, solids, different, types, of, diffusion, are, distinguished, in, porous, solids, molecular, diffusion, occurs, when, the, collision, with, another, molecule, is, more, likely, than, the, collision, with, the, pore, walls, under, such, conditions, the, diffusivity, is, similar, to, that, in, a, non, confined, space, and, is, proportional, to, the, mean, free, path, knudsen, diffusion, occurs, when, the, pore, diameter, is, comparable, to, or, smaller, than, the, mean, free, path, of, the, molecule, diffusing, through, the, pore, under, this, condition, the, collision, with, the, pore, walls, becomes, gradually, more, likely, and, the, diffusivity, is, lower, finally, there, is, configurational, diffusion, which, happens, if, the, molecules, have, comparable, size, to, that, of, the, pore, under, this, condition, the, diffusivity, is, much, lower, compared, to, molecular, diffusion, and, small, differences, in, the, kinetic, diameter, of, the, molecule, cause, large, differences, in, diffusivity, biologists, often, use, the, terms, net, movement, or, net, diffusion, to, describe, the, movement, of, ions, or, molecules, by, diffusion, for, example, oxygen, can, diffuse, through, cell, membranes, so, long, as, there, is, a, higher, concentration, of, oxygen, outside, the, cell, however, because, the, movement, of, molecules, is, random, occasionally, oxygen, molecules, move, out, of, the, cell, against, the, concentration, gradient, because, there, are, more, oxygen, molecules, outside, the, cell, the, probability, that, oxygen, molecules, will, enter, the, cell, is, higher, than, the, probability, that, oxygen, molecules, will, leave, the, cell, therefore, the, net, movement, of, oxygen, molecules, the, difference, between, the, number, of, molecules, either, entering, or, leaving, the, cell, is, into, the, cell, in, other, words, there, is, a, net, movement, of, oxygen, molecules, down, the, concentration, gradient, in, the, scope, of, time, diffusion, in, solids, was, used, long, before, the, theory, of, diffusion, was, created, for, example, pliny, the, elder, had, previously, described, the, cementation, process, which, produces, steel, from, the, element, iron, fe, through, carbon, diffusion, another, example, is, well, known, for, many, centuries, the, diffusion, of, colors, of, stained, glass, or, earthenware, and, chinese, ceramics, in, modern, science, the, first, systematic, experimental, study, of, diffusion, was, performed, by, thomas, graham, he, studied, diffusion, in, gases, and, the, main, phenomenon, was, described, by, him, in, 1831, 1833, gases, of, different, nature, when, brought, into, contact, do, not, arrange, themselves, according, to, their, density, the, heaviest, undermost, and, the, lighter, uppermost, but, they, spontaneously, diffuse, mutually, and, equally, through, each, other, and, so, remain, in, the, intimate, state, of, mixture, for, any, length, of, time, the, measurements, of, graham, contributed, to, james, clerk, maxwell, deriving, in, 1867, the, coefficient, of, diffusion, for, co, 2, in, the, air, the, error, rate, is, less, than, 5, in, 1855, adolf, fick, the, 26, year, old, anatomy, demonstrator, from, z, rich, proposed, his, law, of, diffusion, he, used, graham, s, research, stating, his, goal, as, the, development, of, a, fundamental, law, for, the, operation, of, diffusion, in, a, single, element, of, space, he, asserted, a, deep, analogy, between, diffusion, and, conduction, of, heat, or, electricity, creating, a, formalism, similar, to, fourier, s, law, for, heat, conduction, 1822, and, ohm, s, law, for, electric, current, 1827, robert, boyle, demonstrated, diffusion, in, solids, in, the, 17th, century, by, penetration, of, zinc, into, a, copper, coin, nevertheless, diffusion, in, solids, was, not, systematically, studied, until, the, second, part, of, the, 19th, century, william, chandler, roberts, austen, the, well, known, british, metallurgist, and, former, assistant, of, thomas, graham, studied, systematically, solid, state, diffusion, on, the, example, of, gold, in, lead, in, 1896, my, long, connection, with, graham, s, researches, made, it, almost, a, duty, to, attempt, to, extend, his, work, on, liquid, diffusion, to, metals, in, 1858, rudolf, clausius, introduced, the, concept, of, the, mean, free, path, in, the, same, year, james, clerk, maxwell, developed, the, first, atomistic, theory, of, transport, processes, in, gases, the, modern, atomistic, theory, of, diffusion, and, brownian, motion, was, developed, by, albert, einstein, marian, smoluchowski, and, jean, baptiste, perrin, ludwig, boltzmann, in, the, development, of, the, atomistic, backgrounds, of, the, macroscopic, transport, processes, introduced, the, boltzmann, equation, which, has, served, mathematics, and, physics, with, a, source, of, transport, process, ideas, and, concerns, for, more, than, 140, years, in, 1920, 1921, george, de, hevesy, measured, self, diffusion, using, radioisotopes, he, studied, self, diffusion, of, radioactive, isotopes, of, lead, in, the, liquid, and, solid, lead, yakov, frenkel, sometimes, jakov, jacob, frenkel, proposed, and, elaborated, in, 1926, the, idea, of, diffusion, in, crystals, through, local, defects, vacancies, and, interstitial, atoms, he, concluded, the, diffusion, process, in, condensed, matter, is, an, ensemble, of, elementary, jumps, and, quasichemical, interactions, of, particles, and, defects, he, introduced, several, mechanisms, of, diffusion, and, found, rate, constants, from, experimental, data, sometime, later, carl, wagner, and, walter, h, schottky, developed, frenkel, s, ideas, about, mechanisms, of, diffusion, further, presently, it, is, universally, recognized, that, atomic, defects, are, necessary, to, mediate, diffusion, in, crystals, henry, eyring, with, co, authors, applied, his, theory, of, absolute, reaction, rates, to, frenkel, s, quasichemical, model, of, diffusion, the, analogy, between, reaction, kinetics, and, diffusion, leads, to, various, nonlinear, versions, of, fick, s, law, each, model, of, diffusion, expresses, the, diffusion, flux, with, the, use, of, concentrations, densities, and, their, derivatives, flux, is, a, vector, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, representing, the, quantity, and, direction, of, transfer, given, a, small, area, s, displaystyle, delta, s, with, normal, displaystyle, boldsymbol, nu, the, transfer, of, a, physical, quantity, n, displaystyle, n, through, the, area, s, displaystyle, delta, s, per, time, t, displaystyle, delta, t, is, where, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, boldsymbol, nu, is, the, inner, product, and, o, displaystyle, o, cdots, is, the, little, o, notation, if, we, use, the, notation, of, vector, area, s, s, displaystyle, delta, mathbf, s, boldsymbol, nu, delta, s, then, the, dimension, of, the, diffusion, flux, is, the, diffusing, physical, quantity, n, displaystyle, n, may, be, the, number, of, particles, mass, energy, electric, charge, or, any, other, scalar, extensive, quantity, for, its, density, n, displaystyle, n, the, diffusion, equation, has, the, form, where, w, displaystyle, w, is, intensity, of, any, local, source, of, this, quantity, for, example, the, rate, of, a, chemical, reaction, for, the, diffusion, equation, the, no, flux, boundary, conditions, can, be, formulated, as, j, x, x, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, j, x, boldsymbol, nu, x, 0, on, the, boundary, where, displaystyle, boldsymbol, nu, is, the, normal, to, the, boundary, at, point, x, displaystyle, x, fick, s, first, law, the, diffusion, flux, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, is, proportional, to, the, negative, gradient, of, spatial, concentration, n, x, t, displaystyle, n, x, t, where, d, is, the, diffusion, coefficient, the, corresponding, diffusion, equation, fick, s, second, law, is, in, case, the, diffusion, coefficient, is, independent, of, x, displaystyle, x, fick, s, second, law, can, be, simplified, to, where, displaystyle, delta, is, the, laplace, operator, fick, s, law, describes, diffusion, of, an, admixture, in, a, medium, the, concentration, of, this, admixture, should, be, small, and, the, gradient, of, this, concentration, should, be, also, small, the, driving, force, of, diffusion, in, fick, s, law, is, the, antigradient, of, concentration, n, displaystyle, nabla, n, in, 1931, lars, onsager, included, the, multicomponent, transport, processes, in, the, general, context, of, linear, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, for, multi, component, transport, where, j, i, displaystyle, mathbf, j, i, is, the, flux, of, the, i, displaystyle, i, th, physical, quantity, component, and, x, j, displaystyle, x, j, is, the, j, displaystyle, j, th, thermodynamic, force, the, thermodynamic, forces, for, the, transport, processes, were, introduced, by, onsager, as, the, space, gradients, of, the, derivatives, of, the, entropy, density, s, displaystyle, s, he, used, the, term, force, in, quotation, marks, or, driving, force, where, n, i, displaystyle, n, i, are, the, thermodynamic, coordinates, for, the, heat, and, mass, transfer, one, can, take, n, 0, u, displaystyle, n, 0, u, the, density, of, internal, energy, and, n, i, displaystyle, n, i, is, the, concentration, of, the, i, displaystyle, i, th, component, the, corresponding, driving, forces, are, the, space, vectors, where, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, i, displaystyle, mu, i, is, the, chemical, potential, of, the, i, displaystyle, i, th, component, it, should, be, stressed, that, the, separate, diffusion, equations, describe, the, mixing, or, mass, transport, without, bulk, motion, therefore, the, terms, with, variation, of, the, total, pressure, are, neglected, it, is, possible, for, diffusion, of, small, admixtures, and, for, small, gradients, for, the, linear, onsager, equations, we, must, take, the, thermodynamic, forces, in, the, linear, approximation, near, equilibrium, where, the, derivatives, of, s, displaystyle, s, are, calculated, at, equilibrium, n, displaystyle, n, the, matrix, of, the, kinetic, coefficients, l, i, j, displaystyle, l, ij, should, be, symmetric, onsager, reciprocal, relations, and, positive, definite, for, the, entropy, growth, the, transport, equations, are, here, all, the, indexes, i, j, k, 0, 1, 2, are, related, to, the, internal, energy, 0, and, various, components, the, expression, in, the, square, brackets, is, the, matrix, d, i, k, displaystyle, d, ik, of, the, diffusion, i, k, 0, thermodiffusion, i, 0, k, 0, or, k, 0, i, 0, and, thermal, conductivity, i, k, 0, coefficients, under, isothermal, conditions, t, constant, the, relevant, thermodynamic, potential, is, the, free, energy, or, the, free, entropy, the, thermodynamic, driving, forces, for, the, isothermal, diffusion, are, antigradients, of, chemical, potentials, 1, t, j, displaystyle, 1, t, nabla, mu, j, and, the, matrix, of, diffusion, coefficients, is, i, k, 0, there, is, intrinsic, arbitrariness, in, the, definition, of, the, thermodynamic, forces, and, kinetic, coefficients, because, they, are, not, measurable, separately, and, only, their, combinations, j, l, i, j, x, j, textstyle, sum, j, l, ij, x, j, can, be, measured, for, example, in, the, original, work, of, onsager, the, thermodynamic, forces, include, additional, multiplier, t, whereas, in, the, course, of, theoretical, physics, this, multiplier, is, omitted, but, the, sign, of, the, thermodynamic, forces, is, opposite, all, these, changes, are, supplemented, by, the, corresponding, changes, in, the, coefficients, and, do, not, affect, the, measurable, quantities, the, formalism, of, linear, irreversible, thermodynamics, onsager, generates, the, systems, of, linear, diffusion, equations, in, the, form, if, the, matrix, of, diffusion, coefficients, is, diagonal, then, this, system, of, equations, is, just, a, collection, of, decoupled, fick, s, equations, for, various, components, assume, that, diffusion, is, non, diagonal, for, example, d, 12, 0, displaystyle, d, 12, neq, 0, and, consider, the, state, with, c, 2, c, n, 0, displaystyle, c, 2, cdots, c, n, 0, at, this, state, c, 2, t, d, 12, c, 1, displaystyle, partial, c, 2, partial, t, d, 12, delta, c, 1, if, d, 12, c, 1, x, 0, displaystyle, d, 12, delta, c, 1, x, 0, at, some, points, then, c, 2, x, displaystyle, c, 2, x, becomes, negative, at, these, points, in, a, short, time, therefore, linear, non, diagonal, diffusion, does, not, preserve, positivity, of, concentrations, non, diagonal, equations, of, multicomponent, diffusion, must, be, non, linear, the, einstein, relation, kinetic, theory, connects, the, diffusion, coefficient, and, the, mobility, the, ratio, of, the, particle, s, terminal, drift, velocity, to, an, applied, force, for, charged, particles, where, d, is, the, diffusion, constant, is, the, mobility, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, q, is, the, elementary, charge, that, is, the, charge, of, one, electron, below, to, combine, in, the, same, formula, the, chemical, potential, and, the, mobility, we, use, for, mobility, the, notation, m, displaystyle, mathfrak, m, the, mobility, based, approach, was, further, applied, by, t, teorell, in, 1935, he, studied, the, diffusion, of, ions, through, a, membrane, he, formulated, the, essence, of, his, approach, in, the, formula, this, is, the, so, called, teorell, formula, the, term, gram, ion, gram, particle, is, used, for, a, quantity, of, a, substance, that, contains, the, avogadro, number, of, ions, particles, the, common, modern, term, is, mole, the, force, under, isothermal, conditions, consists, of, two, parts, here, r, is, the, gas, constant, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, n, is, the, concentration, the, equilibrium, concentration, is, marked, by, a, superscript, eq, q, is, the, charge, and, is, the, electric, potential, the, simple, but, crucial, difference, between, the, teorell, formula, and, the, onsager, laws, is, the, concentration, factor, in, the, teorell, expression, for, the, flux, in, the, einstein, teorell, approach, if, for, the, finite, force, the, concentration, tends, to, zero, then, the, flux, also, tends, to, zero, whereas, the, onsager, equations, violate, this, simple, and, physically, obvious, rule, the, general, formulation, of, the, teorell, formula, for, non, perfect, systems, under, isothermal, conditions, is, where, is, the, chemical, potential, 0, is, the, standard, value, of, the, chemical, potential, the, expression, a, exp, 0, r, t, displaystyle, a, exp, left, frac, mu, mu, 0, rt, right, is, the, so, called, activity, it, measures, the, effective, concentration, of, a, species, in, a, non, ideal, mixture, in, this, notation, the, teorell, formula, for, the, flux, has, a, very, simple, form, the, standard, derivation, of, the, activity, includes, a, normalization, factor, and, for, small, concentrations, a, n, n, o, n, n, displaystyle, a, n, n, ominus, o, n, n, ominus, where, n, displaystyle, n, ominus, is, the, standard, concentration, therefore, this, formula, for, the, flux, describes, the, flux, of, the, normalized, dimensionless, quantity, n, n, displaystyle, n, n, ominus, the, einstein, model, neglects, the, inertia, of, the, diffusing, partial, the, alternative, langevin, equation, starts, with, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, where, solving, this, equation, one, obtained, the, time, dependent, diffusion, constant, in, the, long, time, limit, and, when, the, particle, is, significantly, denser, than, the, surrounding, fluid, where, at, long, time, scales, einstein, s, result, is, recovered, but, short, time, scales, the, ballistic, regime, are, also, explained, moreover, unlike, the, einstein, approach, a, velocity, can, be, defined, leading, to, the, fluctuation, dissipation, theorem, connecting, the, competition, between, friction, and, random, forces, in, defining, the, temperature, 3, 2, diffusion, of, reagents, on, the, surface, of, a, catalyst, may, play, an, important, role, in, heterogeneous, catalysis, the, model, of, diffusion, in, the, ideal, monolayer, is, based, on, the, jumps, of, the, reagents, on, the, nearest, free, places, this, model, was, used, for, co, on, pt, oxidation, under, low, gas, pressure, the, system, includes, several, reagents, a, 1, a, 2, a, m, displaystyle, a, 1, a, 2, ldots, a, m, on, the, surface, their, surface, concentrations, are, c, 1, c, 2, c, m, displaystyle, c, 1, c, 2, ldots, c, m, the, surface, is, a, lattice, of, the, adsorption, places, each, reagent, molecule, fills, a, place, on, the, surface, some, of, the, places, are, free, the, concentration, of, the, free, places, is, z, c, 0, displaystyle, z, c, 0, the, sum, of, all, c, i, displaystyle, c, i, including, free, places, is, constant, the, density, of, adsorption, places, b, the, jump, model, gives, for, the, diffusion, flux, of, a, i, displaystyle, a, i, i, 1, n, the, corresponding, diffusion, equation, is, due, to, the, conservation, law, z, b, i, 1, n, c, i, displaystyle, z, b, sum, i, 1, n, c, i, and, we, have, the, system, of, m, diffusion, equations, for, one, component, we, get, fick, s, law, and, linear, equations, because, b, c, c, c, b, c, b, c, displaystyle, b, c, nabla, c, c, nabla, b, c, b, nabla, c, for, two, and, more, components, the, equations, are, nonlinear, if, all, particles, can, exchange, their, positions, with, their, closest, neighbours, then, a, simple, generalization, gives, where, d, i, j, d, j, i, 0, displaystyle, d, ij, d, ji, geq, 0, is, a, symmetric, matrix, of, coefficients, that, characterize, the, intensities, of, jumps, the, free, places, vacancies, should, be, considered, as, special, particles, with, concentration, c, 0, displaystyle, c, 0, various, versions, of, these, jump, models, are, also, suitable, for, simple, diffusion, mechanisms, in, solids, for, diffusion, in, porous, media, the, basic, equations, are, if, is, constant, where, d, is, the, diffusion, coefficient, is, porosity, n, is, the, concentration, m, 0, usually, m, 1, the, case, m, 1, corresponds, to, fick, s, law, care, must, be, taken, to, properly, account, for, the, porosity, of, the, porous, medium, in, both, the, flux, terms, and, the, accumulation, terms, for, example, as, the, porosity, goes, to, zero, the, molar, flux, in, the, porous, medium, goes, to, zero, for, a, given, concentration, gradient, upon, applying, the, divergence, of, the, flux, the, porosity, terms, cancel, out, and, the, second, equation, above, is, formed, for, diffusion, of, gases, in, porous, media, this, equation, is, the, formalization, of, darcy, s, law, the, volumetric, flux, of, a, gas, in, the, porous, media, is, where, k, is, the, permeability, of, the, medium, is, the, viscosity, and, p, is, the, pressure, the, advective, molar, flux, is, given, as, j, nq, and, for, p, n, displaystyle, p, sim, n, gamma,

upsilon, q, phi, combining, the, advective, molar, flux, with, the, diffusive, flux, gives, the, advection, dispersion, equation, n, t, d, n, m, n, m, displaystyle, frac, partial, n, partial, t, d, delta, n, m, nu, cdot, nabla, n, m, for, underground, water, infiltration, the, boussinesq, approximation, gives, the, same, equation, with, m, 2, for, plasma, with, the, high, level, of, radiation, the, zeldovich, raizer, equation, gives, m, 4, for, the, heat, transfer, the, diffusion, coefficient, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, coefficient, in, the, fick, s, first, law, j, d, n, x, displaystyle, j, d, partial, n, partial, x, where, j, is, the, diffusion, flux, amount, of, substance, per, unit, area, per, unit, time, n, for, ideal, mixtures, is, the, concentration, x, is, the, position, consider, two, gases, with, molecules, of, the, same, diameter, d, and, mass, m, self, diffusion, in, this, case, the, elementary, mean, free, path, theory, of, diffusion, gives, for, the, diffusion, coefficient, where, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, t, is, the, temperature, p, is, the, pressure, displaystyle, ell, is, the, mean, free, path, and, v, t, is, the, mean, thermal, speed, we, can, see, that, the, diffusion, coefficient, in, the, mean, free, path, approximation, grows, with, t, as, t, 3, 2, and, decreases, with, p, as, 1, p, if, we, use, for, p, the, ideal, gas, law, p, rnt, with, the, total, concentration, n, then, we, can, see, that, for, given, concentration, n, the, diffusion, coefficient, grows, with, t, as, t, 1, 2, and, for, given, temperature, it, decreases, with, the, total, concentration, as, 1, n, for, two, different, gases, a, and, b, with, molecular, masses, m, a, m, b, and, molecular, diameters, d, a, d, b, the, mean, free, path, estimate, of, the, diffusion, coefficient, of, a, in, b, and, b, in, a, is, in, boltzmann, s, kinetics, of, the, mixture, of, gases, each, gas, has, its, own, distribution, function, f, i, x, c, t, displaystyle, f, i,

in, the, chapman, enskog, approximation, all, the, distribution, functions, are, expressed, through, the, densities, of, the, conserved, quantities, the, kinetic, temperature, t, and, pressure, p, are, defined, in, 3d, space, as, where, n, i, n, i, textstyle, n, sum, i, n, i, is, the, total, density, for, two, gases, the, difference, between, velocities, c, 1, c, 2, displaystyle, c, 1, c, 2, is, given, by, the, expression, where, f, i, displaystyle, f, i, is, the, force, applied, to, the, molecules, of, the, i, th, component, and, k, t, displaystyle, k, t, is, the, thermodiffusion, ratio, the, coefficient, d, 12, is, positive, this, is, the, diffusion, coefficient, four, terms, in, the, formula, for, c, 1, c, 2, describe, four, main, effects, in, the, diffusion, of, gases, all, these, effects, are, called, diffusion, because, they, describe, the, differences, between, velocities, of, different, components, in, the, mixture, therefore, these, effects, cannot, be, described, as, a, bulk, transport, and, differ, from, advection, or, convection, in, the, first, approximation, the, number, a, 1, displaystyle, a, 1, nu, is, defined, by, quadratures, formulas, 3, 7, 3, 9, ch, 10, of, the, classical, chapman, and, cowling, book, we, can, see, that, the, dependence, on, t, for, the, rigid, spheres, is, the, same, as, for, the, simple, mean, free, path, theory, but, for, the, power, repulsion, laws, the, exponent, is, different, dependence, on, a, total, concentration, n, for, a, given, temperature, has, always, the, same, character, 1, n, in, applications, to, gas, dynamics, the, diffusion, flux, and, the, bulk, flow, should, be, joined, in, one, system, of, transport, equations, the, bulk, flow, describes, the, mass, transfer, its, velocity, v, is, the, mass, average, velocity, it, is, defined, through, the, momentum, density, and, the, mass, concentrations, where, i, m, i, n, i, displaystyle, rho, i, m, i, n, i, is, the, mass, concentration, of, the, i, th, species, i, i, textstyle, rho, sum, i, rho, i, is, the, mass, density, by, definition, the, diffusion, velocity, of, the, i, th, component, is, v, i, c, i, v, displaystyle, v, i, c, i, v, i, i, v, i,

rate, in, chemical, reactions, i, w, i, 0, textstyle, sum, i, w, i, 0, in, these, equations, the, term, i, v, displaystyle, nabla, rho, i, v, describes, advection, of, the, i, th, component, and, the, term, i, v, i, displaystyle, nabla, rho, i, v, i, represents, diffusion, of, this, component, in, 1948, wendell, h, furry, proposed, to, use, the, form, of, the, diffusion, rates, found, in, kinetic, theory, as, a, framework, for, the, new, phenomenological, approach, to, diffusion, in, gases, this, approach, was, developed, further, by, f, a, williams, and, s, h, lam, for, the, diffusion, velocities, in, multicomponent, gases, n, components, they, used, here, d, i, j, displaystyle, d, ij, is, the, diffusion, coefficient, matrix, d, i, t, displaystyle, d, i, t, is, the, thermal, diffusion, coefficient, f, i, displaystyle, f, i, is, the, body, force, per, unit, mass, acting, on, the, i, th, species, x, i, p, i, p, displaystyle, x, i, p, i, p, is, the, partial, pressure, fraction, of, the, i, th, species, and, p, i, displaystyle, p, i, is, the, partial, pressure, y, i, i, displaystyle, y, i, rho, i, rho, is, the, mass, fraction, of, the, i, th, species, and, i, x, i, i, y, i, 1, textstyle, sum, i, x, i, sum, i, y, i, 1, when, the, density, of, electrons, in, solids, is, not, in, equilibrium, diffusion, of, electrons, occurs, for, example, when, a, bias, is, applied, to, two, ends, of, a, chunk, of, semiconductor, or, a, light, shines, on, one, end, see, right, figure, electrons, diffuse, from, high, density, regions, center, to, low, density, regions, two, ends, forming, a, gradient, of, electron, density, this, process, generates, current, referred, to, as, diffusion, current, diffusion, current, can, also, be, described, by, fick, s, first, law, where, j, is, the, diffusion, current, density, amount, of, substance, per, unit, area, per, unit, time, n, for, ideal, mixtures, is, the, electron, density, x, is, the, position, analytical, and, numerical, models, that, solve, the, diffusion, equation, for, different, initial, and, boundary, conditions, have, been, popular, for, studying, a, wide, variety, of, changes, to, the, earth, s, surface, diffusion, has, been, used, extensively, in, erosion, studies, of, hillslope, retreat, bluff, erosion, fault, scarp, degradation, wave, cut, terrace, shoreline, retreat, alluvial, channel, incision, coastal, shelf, retreat, and, delta, progradation, although, the, earth, s, surface, is, not, literally, diffusing, in, many, of, these, cases, the, process, of, diffusion, effectively, mimics, the, holistic, changes, that, occur, over, decades, to, millennia, diffusion, models, may, also, be, used, to, solve, inverse, boundary, value, problems, in, which, some, information, about, the, depositional, environment, is, known, from, paleoenvironmental, reconstruction, and, the, diffusion, equation, is, used, to, figure, out, the, sediment, influx, and, time, series, of, landform, changes, dialysis, works, on, the, principles, of, the, diffusion, of, solutes, and, ultrafiltration, of, fluid, across, a, semi, permeable, membrane, diffusion, is, a, property, of, substances, in, water, substances, in, water, tend, to, move, from, an, area, of, high, concentration, to, an, area, of, low, concentration, blood, flows, by, one, side, of, a, semi, permeable, membrane, and, a, dialysate, or, special, dialysis, fluid, flows, by, the, opposite, side, a, semipermeable, membrane, is, a, thin, layer, of, material, that, contains, holes, of, various, sizes, or, pores, smaller, solutes, and, fluid, pass, through, the, membrane, but, the, membrane, blocks, the, passage, of, larger, substances, for, example, red, blood, cells, and, large, proteins, this, replicates, the, filtering, process, that, takes, place, in, the, kidneys, when, the, blood, enters, the, kidneys, and, the, larger, substances, are, separated, from, the, smaller, ones, in, the, glomerulus, one, common, misconception, is, that, individual, atoms, ions, or, molecules, move, randomly, which, they, do, not, in, the, animation, on, the, right, the, ion, in, the, left, panel, appears, to, have, random, motion, in, the, absence, of, other, ions, as, the, right, panel, shows, however, this, motion, is, not, random, but, is, the, result, of, collisions, with, other, ions, as, such, the, movement, of, a, single, atom, ion, or, molecule, within, a, mixture, just, appears, random, when, viewed, in, isolation, the, movement, of, a, substance, within, a, mixture, by, random, walk, is, governed, by, the, kinetic, energy, within, the, system, that, can, be, affected, by, changes, in, concentration, pressure, or, temperature, this, is, a, classical, description, at, smaller, scales, quantum, effects, will, be, non, negligible, in, general, thus, the, study, of, the, movement, of, a, single, atom, becomes, more, subtle, since, particles, at, such, small, scales, are, described, by, probability, amplitudes, rather, than, deterministic, measures, of, position, and, velocity, while, brownian, motion, of, multi, molecular, mesoscopic, particles, like, pollen, grains, studied, by, brown, is, observable, under, an, optical, microscope, molecular, diffusion, can, only, be, probed, in, carefully, controlled, experimental, conditions, since, graham, experiments, it, is, well, known, that, avoiding, of, convection, is, necessary, and, this, may, be, a, non, trivial, task, under, normal, conditions, molecular, diffusion, dominates, only, at, lengths, in, the, nanometre, to, millimetre, range, on, larger, length, scales, transport, in, liquids, and, gases, is, normally, due, to, another, transport, phenomenon, convection, to, separate, diffusion, in, these, cases, special, efforts, are, needed, in, contrast, heat, conduction, through, solid, media, is, an, everyday, occurrence, for, example, a, metal, spoon, partly, immersed, in, a, hot, liquid, this, explains, why, the, diffusion, of, heat, was, explained, mathematically, before, the, diffusion, of, mass
