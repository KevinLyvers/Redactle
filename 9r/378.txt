arsenic, is, a, chemical, element, with, the, symbol, as, and, the, atomic, number, 33, it, is, a, metalloid, and, one, of, the, pnictogens, and, therefore, shares, many, properties, with, its, group, 15, neighbors, phosphorus, and, antimony, arsenic, is, a, notoriously, toxic, heavy, metal, it, occurs, naturally, in, many, minerals, usually, in, combination, with, sulfur, and, metals, but, also, as, a, pure, elemental, crystal, it, has, various, allotropes, but, only, the, grey, form, which, has, a, metallic, appearance, is, important, to, industry, the, primary, use, of, arsenic, is, in, alloys, of, lead, for, example, in, car, batteries, and, ammunition, arsenic, is, a, common, n, type, dopant, in, semiconductor, electronic, devices, it, is, also, a, component, of, the, iii, v, compound, semiconductor, gallium, arsenide, arsenic, and, its, compounds, especially, the, trioxide, are, used, in, the, production, of, pesticides, treated, wood, products, herbicides, and, insecticides, these, applications, are, declining, with, the, increasing, recognition, of, the, toxicity, of, arsenic, and, its, compounds, a, few, species, of, bacteria, are, able, to, use, arsenic, compounds, as, respiratory, metabolites, trace, quantities, of, arsenic, may, be, an, essential, dietary, element, in, rats, hamsters, goats, chickens, and, presumably, other, species, a, role, in, human, metabolism, is, not, known, however, arsenic, poisoning, occurs, in, multicellular, life, if, quantities, are, larger, than, needed, arsenic, contamination, of, groundwater, is, a, problem, that, affects, millions, of, people, across, the, world, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, states, that, all, forms, of, arsenic, are, a, serious, risk, to, human, health, the, united, states, agency, for, toxic, substances, and, disease, registry, ranked, arsenic, number, 1, in, its, 2001, prioritized, list, of, hazardous, substances, at, superfund, sites, arsenic, is, classified, as, a, group, a, carcinogen, the, three, most, common, arsenic, allotropes, are, grey, yellow, and, black, arsenic, with, grey, being, the, most, common, grey, arsenic, as, space, group, r, 3, m, no, 166, adopts, a, double, layered, structure, consisting, of, many, interlocked, ruffled, six, membered, rings, because, of, weak, bonding, between, the, layers, grey, arsenic, is, brittle, and, has, a, relatively, low, mohs, hardness, of, 3, 5, nearest, and, next, nearest, neighbors, form, a, distorted, octahedral, complex, with, the, three, atoms, in, the, same, double, layer, being, slightly, closer, than, the, three, atoms, in, the, next, this, relatively, close, packing, leads, to, a, high, density, of, 5, 73, g, cm, 3, grey, arsenic, is, a, semimetal, but, becomes, a, semiconductor, with, a, bandgap, of, 1, 2, 1, 4, ev, if, amorphized, grey, arsenic, is, also, the, most, stable, form, yellow, arsenic, is, soft, and, waxy, and, somewhat, similar, to, tetraphosphorus, p, 4, both, have, four, atoms, arranged, in, a, tetrahedral, structure, in, which, each, atom, is, bound, to, each, of, the, other, three, atoms, by, a, single, bond, this, unstable, allotrope, being, molecular, is, the, most, volatile, least, dense, and, most, toxic, solid, yellow, arsenic, is, produced, by, rapid, cooling, of, arsenic, vapor, as, 4, it, is, rapidly, transformed, into, grey, arsenic, by, light, the, yellow, form, has, a, density, of, 1, 97, g, cm, 3, black, arsenic, is, similar, in, structure, to, black, phosphorus, black, arsenic, can, also, be, formed, by, cooling, vapor, at, around, 100, 220, c, and, by, crystallization, of, amorphous, arsenic, in, the, presence, of, mercury, vapors, it, is, glassy, and, brittle, black, arsenic, is, also, a, poor, electrical, conductor, arsenic, sublimes, upon, heating, at, atmospheric, pressure, converting, directly, to, a, gaseous, form, without, an, intervening, liquid, state, at, 887, k, 614, c, the, triple, point, is, at, 3, 63, mpa, and, 1, 090, k, 820, c, arsenic, occurs, in, nature, as, one, stable, isotope, 75, as, and, is, therefore, called, a, monoisotopic, element, as, of, 2024, at, least, 32, radioisotopes, have, also, been, synthesized, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 64, to, 95, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 73, as, with, a, half, life, of, 80, 30, days, all, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, under, one, day, with, the, exception, of, 71, as, t, 1, 2, 65, 30, hours, 72, as, t, 1, 2, 26, 0, hours, 74, as, t, 1, 2, 17, 77, days, 76, as, t, 1, 2, 26, 26, hours, and, 77, as, t, 1, 2, 38, 83, hours, isotopes, that, are, lighter, than, the, stable, 75, as, tend, to, decay, by, decay, and, those, that, are, heavier, tend, to, decay, by, decay, with, some, exceptions, at, least, 10, nuclear, isomers, have, been, described, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 66, to, 84, the, most, stable, of, arsenic, s, isomers, is, 68m, as, with, a, half, life, of, 111, seconds, arsenic, has, a, similar, electronegativity, and, ionization, energies, to, its, lighter, pnictogen, congener, phosphorus, and, therefore, readily, forms, covalent, molecules, with, most, of, the, nonmetals, though, stable, in, dry, air, arsenic, forms, a, golden, bronze, tarnish, upon, exposure, to, humidity, which, eventually, becomes, a, black, surface, layer, when, heated, in, air, arsenic, oxidizes, to, arsenic, trioxide, the, fumes, from, this, reaction, have, an, odor, resembling, garlic, this, odor, can, be, detected, on, striking, arsenide, minerals, such, as, arsenopyrite, with, a, hammer, it, burns, in, oxygen, to, form, arsenic, trioxide, and, arsenic, pentoxide, which, have, the, same, structure, as, the, more, well, known, phosphorus, compounds, and, in, fluorine, to, give, arsenic, pentafluoride, arsenic, makes, arsenic, acid, with, concentrated, nitric, acid, arsenous, acid, with, dilute, nitric, acid, and, arsenic, trioxide, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, however, it, does, not, react, with, water, alkalis, or, non, oxidising, acids, arsenic, reacts, with, metals, to, form, arsenides, though, these, are, not, ionic, compounds, containing, the, as, 3, ion, as, the, formation, of, such, an, anion, would, be, highly, endothermic, and, even, the, group, 1, arsenides, have, properties, of, intermetallic, compounds, like, germanium, selenium, and, bromine, which, like, arsenic, succeed, the, 3d, transition, series, arsenic, is, much, less, stable, in, the, 5, oxidation, state, than, its, vertical, neighbors, phosphorus, and, antimony, and, hence, arsenic, pentoxide, and, arsenic, acid, are, potent, oxidizers, compounds, of, arsenic, resemble, in, some, respects, those, of, phosphorus, which, occupies, the, same, group, column, of, the, periodic, table, the, most, common, oxidation, states, for, arsenic, are, 3, in, the, arsenides, which, are, alloy, like, intermetallic, compounds, 3, in, the, arsenites, and, 5, in, the, arsenates, and, most, organoarsenic, compounds, arsenic, also, bonds, readily, to, itself, as, seen, in, the, square, as, 3, 4, ions, in, the, mineral, skutterudite, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, arsenic, is, typically, pyramidal, owing, to, the, influence, of, the, lone, pair, of, electrons, one, of, the, simplest, arsenic, compounds, is, the, trihydride, the, highly, toxic, flammable, pyrophoric, arsine, ash, 3, this, compound, is, generally, regarded, as, stable, since, it, decomposes, slowly, at, room, temperature, at, temperatures, of, 250, 300, c, decomposition, to, arsenic, and, hydrogen, is, rapid, several, factors, such, as, humidity, presence, of, light, and, certain, catalysts, namely, aluminium, facilitate, the, rate, of, decomposition, it, oxidises, readily, in, air, to, form, arsenic, trioxide, and, water, and, analogous, reactions, take, place, with, sulfur, and, selenium, instead, of, oxygen, arsenic, forms, colorless, odorless, crystalline, oxides, as, 2, o, 3, white, arsenic, and, as, 2, o, 5, which, are, hygroscopic, and, readily, soluble, in, water, to, form, acidic, solutions, arsenic, v, acid, is, a, weak, acid, and, its, salts, known, as, arsenates, are, a, major, source, of, arsenic, contamination, of, groundwater, in, regions, with, high, levels, of, naturally, occurring, arsenic, minerals, synthetic, arsenates, include, scheele, s, green, cupric, hydrogen, arsenate, acidic, copper, arsenate, calcium, arsenate, and, lead, hydrogen, arsenate, these, three, have, been, used, as, agricultural, insecticides, and, poisons, the, protonation, steps, between, the, arsenate, and, arsenic, acid, are, similar, to, those, between, phosphate, and, phosphoric, acid, unlike, phosphorous, acid, arsenous, acid, is, genuinely, tribasic, with, the, formula, as, oh, 3, a, broad, variety, of, sulfur, compounds, of, arsenic, are, known, orpiment, as, 2, s, 3, and, realgar, as, 4, s, 4, are, somewhat, abundant, and, were, formerly, used, as, painting, pigments, in, as, 4, s, 10, arsenic, has, a, formal, oxidation, state, of, 2, in, as, 4, s, 4, which, features, as, as, bonds, so, that, the, total, covalency, of, as, is, still, 3, both, orpiment, and, realgar, as, well, as, as, 4, s, 3, have, selenium, analogs, the, analogous, as, 2, te, 3, is, known, as, the, mineral, kalgoorlieite, and, the, anion, as, 2, te, is, known, as, a, ligand, in, cobalt, complexes, all, trihalides, of, arsenic, iii, are, well, known, except, the, astatide, which, is, unknown, arsenic, pentafluoride, asf, 5, is, the, only, important, pentahalide, reflecting, the, lower, stability, of, the, 5, oxidation, state, even, so, it, is, a, very, strong, fluorinating, and, oxidizing, agent, the, pentachloride, is, stable, only, below, 50, c, at, which, temperature, it, decomposes, to, the, trichloride, releasing, chlorine, gas, arsenic, is, used, as, the, group, 5, element, in, the, iii, v, semiconductors, gallium, arsenide, indium, arsenide, and, aluminium, arsenide, the, valence, electron, count, of, gaas, is, the, same, as, a, pair, of, si, atoms, but, the, band, structure, is, completely, different, which, results, in, distinct, bulk, properties, other, arsenic, alloys, include, the, ii, v, semiconductor, cadmium, arsenide, a, large, variety, of, organoarsenic, compounds, are, known, several, were, developed, as, chemical, warfare, agents, during, world, war, i, including, vesicants, such, as, lewisite, and, vomiting, agents, such, as, adamsite, cacodylic, acid, which, is, of, historic, and, practical, interest, arises, from, the, methylation, of, arsenic, trioxide, a, reaction, that, has, no, analogy, in, phosphorus, chemistry, cacodyl, was, the, first, organometallic, compound, known, even, though, arsenic, is, not, a, true, metal, and, was, named, from, the, greek, stink, for, its, offensive, garlic, like, odor, it, is, very, toxic, arsenic, is, the, 53rd, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, comprising, about, 1, 5, parts, per, million, 0, 00015, typical, background, concentrations, of, arsenic, do, not, exceed, 3, ng, m, 3, in, the, atmosphere, 100, mg, kg, in, soil, 400, g, kg, in, vegetation, 10, g, l, in, freshwater, and, 1, 5, g, l, in, seawater, arsenic, is, the, 22nd, most, abundant, element, in, seawater, and, ranks, 41st, in, abundance, in, the, universe, minerals, with, the, formula, mass, and, mas, 2, m, fe, ni, co, are, the, dominant, commercial, sources, of, arsenic, together, with, realgar, an, arsenic, sulfide, mineral, and, native, elemental, arsenic, an, illustrative, mineral, is, arsenopyrite, fe, as, s, which, is, structurally, related, to, iron, pyrite, many, minor, as, containing, minerals, are, known, arsenic, also, occurs, in, various, organic, forms, in, the, environment, in, 2014, china, was, the, top, producer, of, white, arsenic, with, almost, 70, world, share, followed, by, morocco, russia, and, belgium, according, to, the, british, geological, survey, and, the, united, states, geological, survey, most, arsenic, refinement, operations, in, the, us, and, europe, have, closed, over, environmental, concerns, arsenic, is, found, in, the, smelter, dust, from, copper, gold, and, lead, smelters, and, is, recovered, primarily, from, copper, refinement, dust, on, roasting, arsenopyrite, in, air, arsenic, sublimes, as, arsenic, iii, oxide, leaving, iron, oxides, while, roasting, without, air, results, in, the, production, of, gray, arsenic, further, purification, from, sulfur, and, other, chalcogens, is, achieved, by, sublimation, in, vacuum, in, a, hydrogen, atmosphere, or, by, distillation, from, molten, lead, arsenic, mixture, the, word, arsenic, has, its, origin, in, the, syriac, word, zarnika, from, arabic, al, zarn, the, orpiment, based, on, persian, zar, gold, from, the, word, zarnikh, meaning, yellow, literally, gold, colored, and, hence, yellow, orpiment, it, was, adopted, into, greek, using, folk, etymology, as, arsenikon, a, neuter, form, of, the, greek, adjective, arsenikos, meaning, male, virile, latin, speakers, adopted, the, greek, term, as, arsenicum, which, in, french, ultimately, became, arsenic, whence, the, english, word, arsenic, arsenic, sulfides, orpiment, realgar, and, oxides, have, been, known, and, used, since, ancient, times, zosimos, c, 300, ad, describes, roasting, sandarach, realgar, to, obtain, cloud, of, arsenic, arsenic, trioxide, which, he, then, reduces, to, gray, arsenic, as, the, symptoms, of, arsenic, poisoning, are, not, very, specific, the, substance, was, frequently, used, for, murder, until, the, advent, in, the, 1830s, of, the, marsh, test, a, sensitive, chemical, test, for, its, presence, another, less, sensitive, but, more, general, test, is, the, reinsch, test, owing, to, its, use, by, the, ruling, class, to, murder, one, another, and, its, potency, and, discreetness, arsenic, has, been, called, the, poison, of, kings, and, the, king, of, poisons, arsenic, became, known, as, the, inheritance, powder, due, to, its, use, in, killing, family, members, in, the, renaissance, era, during, the, bronze, age, arsenic, was, melted, with, copper, to, make, arsenical, bronze, jabir, ibn, hayyan, described, the, isolation, of, arsenic, before, 815, ad, albertus, magnus, albert, the, great, 1193, 1280, later, isolated, the, element, from, a, compound, in, 1250, by, heating, soap, together, with, arsenic, trisulfide, in, 1649, johann, schr, der, published, two, ways, of, preparing, arsenic, crystals, of, elemental, native, arsenic, are, found, in, nature, although, rarely, cadet, s, fuming, liquid, impure, cacodyl, often, claimed, as, the, first, synthetic, organometallic, compound, was, synthesized, in, 1760, by, louis, claude, cadet, de, gassicourt, through, the, reaction, of, potassium, acetate, with, arsenic, trioxide, in, the, victorian, era, women, would, eat, arsenic, white, arsenic, or, arsenic, trioxide, mixed, with, vinegar, and, chalk, to, improve, the, complexion, of, their, faces, making, their, skin, paler, to, show, they, did, not, work, in, the, fields, the, accidental, use, of, arsenic, in, the, adulteration, of, foodstuffs, led, to, the, bradford, sweet, poisoning, in, 1858, which, resulted, in, 21, deaths, from, the, late, 18th, century, wallpaper, production, began, to, use, dyes, made, from, arsenic, which, was, thought, to, increase, the, pigment, s, brightness, one, account, of, the, illness, and, 1821, death, of, napoleon, i, implicates, arsenic, poisoning, involving, wallpaper, two, arsenic, pigments, have, been, widely, used, since, their, discovery, paris, green, in, 1814, and, scheele, s, green, in, 1775, after, the, toxicity, of, arsenic, became, widely, known, these, chemicals, were, used, less, often, as, pigments, and, more, often, as, insecticides, in, the, 1860s, an, arsenic, byproduct, of, dye, production, london, purple, was, widely, used, this, was, a, solid, mixture, of, arsenic, trioxide, aniline, lime, and, ferrous, oxide, insoluble, in, water, and, very, toxic, by, inhalation, or, ingestion, but, it, was, later, replaced, with, paris, green, another, arsenic, based, dye, with, better, understanding, of, the, toxicology, mechanism, two, other, compounds, were, used, starting, in, the, 1890s, arsenite, of, lime, and, arsenate, of, lead, were, used, widely, as, insecticides, until, the, discovery, of, ddt, in, 1942, in, small, doses, soluble, arsenic, compounds, act, as, stimulants, and, were, once, popular, as, medicine, by, people, in, the, mid, 18th, to, 19th, centuries, this, use, was, especially, prevalent, for, sport, animals, such, as, race, horses, or, work, dogs, and, continued, into, the, 20th, century, a, 2006, study, of, the, remains, of, the, australian, racehorse, phar, lap, determined, that, its, 1932, death, was, caused, by, a, massive, overdose, of, arsenic, sydney, veterinarian, percy, sykes, stated, in, those, days, arsenic, was, quite, a, common, tonic, usually, given, in, the, form, of, a, solution, fowler, s, solution, it, was, so, common, that, i, d, reckon, 90, per, cent, of, the, horses, had, arsenic, in, their, system, the, toxicity, of, arsenic, to, insects, bacteria, and, fungi, led, to, its, use, as, a, wood, preservative, in, the, 1930s, a, process, of, treating, wood, with, chromated, copper, arsenate, also, known, as, cca, or, tanalith, was, invented, and, for, decades, this, treatment, was, the, most, extensive, industrial, use, of, arsenic, an, increased, appreciation, of, the, toxicity, of, arsenic, led, to, a, ban, of, cca, in, consumer, products, in, 2004, initiated, by, the, european, union, and, united, states, however, cca, remains, in, heavy, use, in, other, countries, such, as, on, malaysian, rubber, plantations, arsenic, was, also, used, in, various, agricultural, insecticides, and, poisons, for, example, lead, hydrogen, arsenate, was, a, common, insecticide, on, fruit, trees, but, contact, with, the, compound, sometimes, resulted, in, brain, damage, among, those, working, the, sprayers, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, monosodium, methyl, arsenate, msma, and, disodium, methyl, arsenate, dsma, less, toxic, organic, forms, of, arsenic, replaced, lead, arsenate, in, agriculture, these, organic, arsenicals, were, in, turn, phased, out, in, the, united, states, by, 2013, in, all, agricultural, activities, except, cotton, farming, the, biogeochemistry, of, arsenic, is, complex, and, includes, various, adsorption, and, desorption, processes, the, toxicity, of, arsenic, is, connected, to, its, solubility, and, is, affected, by, ph, arsenite, aso, 3, 3, is, more, soluble, than, arsenate, aso, 3, 4, and, is, more, toxic, however, at, a, lower, ph, arsenate, becomes, more, mobile, and, toxic, it, was, found, that, addition, of, sulfur, phosphorus, and, iron, oxides, to, high, arsenite, soils, greatly, reduces, arsenic, phytotoxicity, arsenic, is, used, as, a, feed, additive, in, poultry, and, swine, production, in, particular, it, was, used, in, the, u, s, until, 2015, to, increase, weight, gain, improve, feed, efficiency, and, prevent, disease, an, example, is, roxarsone, which, had, been, used, as, a, broiler, starter, by, about, 70, of, u, s, broiler, growers, in, 2011, alpharma, a, subsidiary, of, pfizer, inc, which, produces, roxarsone, voluntarily, suspended, sales, of, the, drug, in, response, to, studies, showing, elevated, levels, of, inorganic, arsenic, a, carcinogen, in, treated, chickens, a, successor, to, alpharma, zoetis, continued, to, sell, nitarsone, until, 2015, primarily, for, use, in, turkeys, during, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, a, number, of, arsenic, compounds, were, used, as, medicines, including, arsphenamine, by, paul, ehrlich, and, arsenic, trioxide, by, thomas, fowler, for, treating, diseases, such, as, cancer, or, psoriasis, arsphenamine, as, well, as, neosalvarsan, was, indicated, for, syphilis, but, has, been, superseded, by, modern, antibiotics, however, arsenicals, such, as, melarsoprol, are, still, used, for, the, treatment, of, trypanosomiasis, since, although, these, drugs, have, the, disadvantage, of, severe, toxicity, the, disease, is, almost, uniformly, fatal, if, untreated, in, 2000, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, approved, arsenic, trioxide, for, the, treatment, of, patients, with, acute, promyelocytic, leukemia, that, is, resistant, to, all, trans, retinoic, acid, a, 2008, paper, reports, success, in, locating, tumors, using, arsenic, 74, a, positron, emitter, this, isotope, produces, clearer, pet, scan, images, than, the, previous, radioactive, agent, iodine, 124, because, the, body, tends, to, transport, iodine, to, the, thyroid, gland, producing, signal, noise, nanoparticles, of, arsenic, have, shown, ability, to, kill, cancer, cells, with, lesser, cytotoxicity, than, other, arsenic, formulations, the, main, use, of, arsenic, is, in, alloying, with, lead, lead, components, in, car, batteries, are, strengthened, by, the, presence, of, a, very, small, percentage, of, arsenic, dezincification, of, brass, a, copper, zinc, alloy, is, greatly, reduced, by, the, addition, of, arsenic, phosphorus, deoxidized, arsenical, copper, with, an, arsenic, content, of, 0, 3, has, an, increased, corrosion, stability, in, certain, environments, gallium, arsenide, is, an, important, semiconductor, material, used, in, integrated, circuits, circuits, made, from, gaas, are, much, faster, but, also, much, more, expensive, than, those, made, from, silicon, unlike, silicon, gaas, has, a, direct, bandgap, and, can, be, used, in, laser, diodes, and, leds, to, convert, electrical, energy, directly, into, light, after, world, war, i, the, united, states, built, a, stockpile, of, 20, 000, tons, of, weaponized, lewisite, clch, chascl, 2, an, organoarsenic, vesicant, blister, agent, and, lung, irritant, the, stockpile, was, neutralized, with, bleach, and, dumped, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, the, 1950s, during, the, vietnam, war, the, united, states, used, agent, blue, a, mixture, of, sodium, cacodylate, and, its, acid, form, as, one, of, the, rainbow, herbicides, to, deprive, north, vietnamese, soldiers, of, foliage, cover, and, rice, some, species, of, bacteria, obtain, their, energy, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, by, oxidizing, various, fuels, while, reducing, arsenate, to, arsenite, under, oxidative, environmental, conditions, some, bacteria, use, arsenite, as, fuel, which, they, oxidize, to, arsenate, the, enzymes, involved, are, known, as, arsenate, reductases, arr, in, 2008, bacteria, were, discovered, that, employ, a, version, of, photosynthesis, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, with, arsenites, as, electron, donors, producing, arsenates, just, as, ordinary, photosynthesis, uses, water, as, electron, donor, producing, molecular, oxygen, researchers, conjecture, that, over, the, course, of, history, these, photosynthesizing, organisms, produced, the, arsenates, that, allowed, the, arsenate, reducing, bacteria, to, thrive, one, strain, phs, 1, has, been, isolated, and, is, related, to, the, gammaproteobacterium, ectothiorhodospira, shaposhnikovii, the, mechanism, is, unknown, but, an, encoded, arr, enzyme, may, function, in, reverse, to, its, known, homologues, in, 2011, it, was, postulated, that, the, halomonadaceae, strain, gfaj, 1, could, be, grown, in, the, absence, of, phosphorus, if, that, element, were, substituted, with, arsenic, exploiting, the, fact, that, the, arsenate, and, phosphate, anions, are, similar, structurally, the, study, was, widely, criticised, and, subsequently, refuted, by, independent, researcher, groups, arsenic, may, be, an, essential, trace, mineral, in, birds, involved, in, the, synthesis, of, methionine, metabolites, with, feeding, recommendations, being, between, 0, 012, and, 0, 050, mg, kg, some, evidence, indicates, that, arsenic, is, an, essential, trace, mineral, in, mammals, however, the, biological, function, is, not, known, arsenic, has, been, linked, to, epigenetic, changes, heritable, changes, in, gene, expression, that, occur, without, changes, in, dna, sequence, these, include, dna, methylation, histone, modification, and, rna, interference, toxic, levels, of, arsenic, cause, significant, dna, hypermethylation, of, tumor, suppressor, genes, p16, and, p53, thus, increasing, risk, of, carcinogenesis, these, epigenetic, events, have, been, studied, in, vitro, using, human, kidney, cells, and, in, vivo, using, rat, liver, cells, and, peripheral, blood, leukocytes, in, humans, inductively, coupled, plasma, mass, spectrometry, icp, ms, is, used, to, detect, precise, levels, of, intracellular, arsenic, and, other, arsenic, bases, involved, in, epigenetic, modification, of, dna, studies, investigating, arsenic, as, an, epigenetic, factor, can, be, used, to, develop, precise, biomarkers, of, exposure, and, susceptibility, the, chinese, brake, fern, pteris, vittata, hyperaccumulates, arsenic, from, the, soil, into, its, leaves, and, has, a, proposed, use, in, phytoremediation, inorganic, arsenic, and, its, compounds, upon, entering, the, food, chain, are, progressively, metabolized, through, a, process, of, methylation, for, example, the, mold, scopulariopsis, brevicaulis, produces, trimethylarsine, if, inorganic, arsenic, is, present, the, organic, compound, arsenobetaine, is, found, in, some, marine, foods, such, as, fish, and, algae, and, also, in, mushrooms, in, larger, concentrations, the, average, person, s, intake, is, about, 10, 50, g, day, values, about, 1000, g, are, not, unusual, following, consumption, of, fish, or, mushrooms, but, there, is, little, danger, in, eating, fish, because, this, arsenic, compound, is, nearly, non, toxic, naturally, occurring, sources, of, human, exposure, include, volcanic, ash, weathering, of, minerals, and, ores, and, mineralized, groundwater, arsenic, is, also, found, in, food, water, soil, and, air, arsenic, is, absorbed, by, all, plants, but, is, more, concentrated, in, leafy, vegetables, rice, apple, and, grape, juice, and, seafood, an, additional, route, of, exposure, is, inhalation, of, atmospheric, gases, and, dusts, during, the, victorian, era, arsenic, was, widely, used, in, home, decor, especially, wallpapers, in, europe, an, analysis, based, on, 20, 000, soil, samples, across, all, 28, countries, show, that, 98, of, sampled, soils, have, concentrations, less, than, 20, mg, kg, 1, in, addition, the, as, hotspots, are, related, to, frequent, fertilization, and, close, distance, to, mining, activities, extensive, arsenic, contamination, of, groundwater, has, led, to, widespread, arsenic, poisoning, in, bangladesh, and, neighboring, countries, it, is, estimated, that, approximately, 57, million, people, in, the, bengal, basin, are, drinking, groundwater, with, arsenic, concentrations, elevated, above, the, world, health, organization, s, standard, of, 10, parts, per, billion, ppb, however, a, study, of, cancer, rates, in, taiwan, suggested, that, significant, increases, in, cancer, mortality, appear, only, at, levels, above, 150, ppb, the, arsenic, in, the, groundwater, is, of, natural, origin, and, is, released, from, the, sediment, into, the, groundwater, caused, by, the, anoxic, conditions, of, the, subsurface, this, groundwater, was, used, after, local, and, western, ngos, and, the, bangladeshi, government, undertook, a, massive, shallow, tube, well, drinking, water, program, in, the, late, twentieth, century, this, program, was, designed, to, prevent, drinking, of, bacteria, contaminated, surface, waters, but, failed, to, test, for, arsenic, in, the, groundwater, many, other, countries, and, districts, in, southeast, asia, such, as, vietnam, and, cambodia, have, geological, environments, that, produce, groundwater, with, a, high, arsenic, content, arsenicosis, was, reported, in, nakhon, si, thammarat, thailand, in, 1987, and, the, chao, phraya, river, probably, contains, high, levels, of, naturally, occurring, dissolved, arsenic, without, being, a, public, health, problem, because, much, of, the, public, uses, bottled, water, in, pakistan, more, than, 60, million, people, are, exposed, to, arsenic, polluted, drinking, water, indicated, by, a, 2017, report, in, science, podgorski, s, team, investigated, more, than, 1200, samples, and, more, than, 66, exceeded, the, who, minimum, contamination, level, since, the, 1980s, residents, of, the, ba, men, region, of, inner, mongolia, china, have, been, chronically, exposed, to, arsenic, through, drinking, water, from, contaminated, wells, a, 2009, research, study, observed, an, elevated, presence, of, skin, lesions, among, residents, with, well, water, arsenic, concentrations, between, 5, and, 10, g, l, suggesting, that, arsenic, induced, toxicity, may, occur, at, relatively, low, concentrations, with, chronic, exposure, overall, 20, of, china, s, 34, provinces, have, high, arsenic, concentrations, in, the, groundwater, supply, potentially, exposing, 19, million, people, to, hazardous, drinking, water, a, study, by, iit, kharagpur, found, high, levels, of, arsenic, in, groundwater, of, 20, of, india, s, land, exposing, more, than, 250, million, people, states, such, as, punjab, bihar, west, bengal, assam, haryana, uttar, pradesh, and, gujarat, have, highest, land, area, exposed, to, arsenic, in, the, united, states, arsenic, is, most, commonly, found, in, the, ground, waters, of, the, southwest, parts, of, new, england, michigan, wisconsin, minnesota, and, the, dakotas, are, also, known, to, have, significant, concentrations, of, arsenic, in, ground, water, increased, levels, of, skin, cancer, have, been, associated, with, arsenic, exposure, in, wisconsin, even, at, levels, below, the, 10, ppb, drinking, water, standard, according, to, a, recent, film, funded, by, the, us, superfund, millions, of, private, wells, have, unknown, arsenic, levels, and, in, some, areas, of, the, us, more, than, 20, of, the, wells, may, contain, levels, that, exceed, established, limits, low, level, exposure, to, arsenic, at, concentrations, of, 100, ppb, i, e, above, the, 10, ppb, drinking, water, standard, compromises, the, initial, immune, response, to, h1n1, or, swine, flu, infection, according, to, niehs, supported, scientists, the, study, conducted, in, laboratory, mice, suggests, that, people, exposed, to, arsenic, in, their, drinking, water, may, be, at, increased, risk, for, more, serious, illness, or, death, from, the, virus, some, canadians, are, drinking, water, that, contains, inorganic, arsenic, private, dug, well, waters, are, most, at, risk, for, containing, inorganic, arsenic, preliminary, well, water, analysis, typically, does, not, test, for, arsenic, researchers, at, the, geological, survey, of, canada, have, modeled, relative, variation, in, natural, arsenic, hazard, potential, for, the, province, of, new, brunswick, this, study, has, important, implications, for, potable, water, and, health, concerns, relating, to, inorganic, arsenic, epidemiological, evidence, from, chile, shows, a, dose, dependent, connection, between, chronic, arsenic, exposure, and, various, forms, of, cancer, in, particular, when, other, risk, factors, such, as, cigarette, smoking, are, present, these, effects, have, been, demonstrated, at, contaminations, less, than, 50, ppb, arsenic, is, itself, a, constituent, of, tobacco, smoke, analyzing, multiple, epidemiological, studies, on, inorganic, arsenic, exposure, suggests, a, small, but, measurable, increase, in, risk, for, bladder, cancer, at, 10, ppb, according, to, peter, ravenscroft, of, the, department, of, geography, at, the, university, of, cambridge, roughly, 80, million, people, worldwide, consume, between, 10, and, 50, ppb, arsenic, in, their, drinking, water, if, they, all, consumed, exactly, 10, ppb, arsenic, in, their, drinking, water, the, previously, cited, multiple, epidemiological, study, analysis, would, predict, an, additional, 2, 000, cases, of, bladder, cancer, alone, this, represents, a, clear, underestimate, of, the, overall, impact, since, it, does, not, include, lung, or, skin, cancer, and, explicitly, underestimates, the, exposure, those, exposed, to, levels, of, arsenic, above, the, current, who, standard, should, weigh, the, costs, and, benefits, of, arsenic, remediation, early, 1973, evaluations, of, the, processes, for, removing, dissolved, arsenic, from, drinking, water, demonstrated, the, efficacy, of, co, precipitation, with, either, iron, or, aluminium, oxides, in, particular, iron, as, a, coagulant, was, found, to, remove, arsenic, with, an, efficacy, exceeding, 90, several, adsorptive, media, systems, have, been, approved, for, use, at, point, of, service, in, a, study, funded, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, us, epa, and, the, national, science, foundation, nsf, a, team, of, european, and, indian, scientists, and, engineers, have, set, up, six, arsenic, treatment, plants, in, west, bengal, based, on, in, situ, remediation, method, sar, technology, this, technology, does, not, use, any, chemicals, and, arsenic, is, left, in, an, insoluble, form, 5, state, in, the, subterranean, zone, by, recharging, aerated, water, into, the, aquifer, and, developing, an, oxidation, zone, that, supports, arsenic, oxidizing, micro, organisms, this, process, does, not, produce, any, waste, stream, or, sludge, and, is, relatively, cheap, another, effective, and, inexpensive, method, to, avoid, arsenic, contamination, is, to, sink, wells, 500, feet, or, deeper, to, reach, purer, waters, a, recent, 2011, study, funded, by, the, us, national, institute, of, environmental, health, sciences, superfund, research, program, shows, that, deep, sediments, can, remove, arsenic, and, take, it, out, of, circulation, in, this, process, called, adsorption, arsenic, sticks, to, the, surfaces, of, deep, sediment, particles, and, is, naturally, removed, from, the, ground, water, magnetic, separations, of, arsenic, at, very, low, magnetic, field, gradients, with, high, surface, area, and, monodisperse, magnetite, fe, 3, o, 4, nanocrystals, have, been, demonstrated, in, point, of, use, water, purification, using, the, high, specific, surface, area, of, fe, 3, o, 4, nanocrystals, the, mass, of, waste, associated, with, arsenic, removal, from, water, has, been, dramatically, reduced, epidemiological, studies, have, suggested, a, correlation, between, chronic, consumption, of, drinking, water, contaminated, with, arsenic, and, the, incidence, of, all, leading, causes, of, mortality, the, literature, indicates, that, arsenic, exposure, is, causative, in, the, pathogenesis, of, diabetes, chaff, based, filters, have, recently, been, shown, to, reduce, the, arsenic, content, of, water, to, 3, g, l, this, may, find, applications, in, areas, where, the, potable, water, is, extracted, from, underground, aquifers, for, several, centuries, the, people, of, san, pedro, de, atacama, in, chile, have, been, drinking, water, that, is, contaminated, with, arsenic, and, some, evidence, suggests, they, have, developed, some, immunity, around, one, third, of, the, world, s, population, drinks, water, from, groundwater, resources, of, this, about, 10, percent, approximately, 300, million, people, obtains, water, from, groundwater, resources, that, are, contaminated, with, unhealthy, levels, of, arsenic, or, fluoride, these, trace, elements, derive, mainly, from, minerals, and, ions, in, the, ground, arsenic, is, unique, among, the, trace, metalloids, and, oxyanion, forming, trace, metals, e, g, as, se, sb, mo, v, cr, u, re, it, is, sensitive, to, mobilization, at, ph, values, typical, of, natural, waters, ph, 6, 5, 8, 5, under, both, oxidizing, and, reducing, conditions, arsenic, can, occur, in, the, environment, in, several, oxidation, states, 3, 0, 3, and, 5, but, in, natural, waters, it, is, mostly, found, in, inorganic, forms, as, oxyanions, of, trivalent, arsenite, or, pentavalent, arsenate, organic, forms, of, arsenic, are, produced, by, biological, activity, mostly, in, surface, waters, but, are, rarely, quantitatively, important, organic, arsenic, compounds, may, however, occur, where, waters, are, significantly, impacted, by, industrial, pollution, arsenic, may, be, solubilized, by, various, processes, when, ph, is, high, arsenic, may, be, released, from, surface, binding, sites, that, lose, their, positive, charge, when, water, level, drops, and, sulfide, minerals, are, exposed, to, air, arsenic, trapped, in, sulfide, minerals, can, be, released, into, water, when, organic, carbon, is, present, in, water, bacteria, are, fed, by, directly, reducing, as, v, to, as, iii, or, by, reducing, the, element, at, the, binding, site, releasing, inorganic, arsenic, the, aquatic, transformations, of, arsenic, are, affected, by, ph, reduction, oxidation, potential, organic, matter, concentration, and, the, concentrations, and, forms, of, other, elements, especially, iron, and, manganese, the, main, factors, are, ph, and, the, redox, potential, generally, the, main, forms, of, arsenic, under, oxic, conditions, are, h, 3, aso, 4, h, 2, aso, 4, haso, 2, 4, and, aso, 3, 4, at, ph, 2, 2, 7, 7, 11, and, 11, respectively, under, reducing, conditions, h, 3, aso, 4, is, predominant, at, ph, 2, 9, oxidation, and, reduction, affects, the, migration, of, arsenic, in, subsurface, environments, arsenite, is, the, most, stable, soluble, form, of, arsenic, in, reducing, environments, and, arsenate, which, is, less, mobile, than, arsenite, is, dominant, in, oxidizing, environments, at, neutral, ph, therefore, arsenic, may, be, more, mobile, under, reducing, conditions, the, reducing, environment, is, also, rich, in, organic, matter, which, may, enhance, the, solubility, of, arsenic, compounds, as, a, result, the, adsorption, of, arsenic, is, reduced, and, dissolved, arsenic, accumulates, in, groundwater, that, is, why, the, arsenic, content, is, higher, in, reducing, environments, than, in, oxidizing, environments, the, presence, of, sulfur, is, another, factor, that, affects, the, transformation, of, arsenic, in, natural, water, arsenic, can, precipitate, when, metal, sulfides, form, in, this, way, arsenic, is, removed, from, the, water, and, its, mobility, decreases, when, oxygen, is, present, bacteria, oxidize, reduced, sulfur, to, generate, energy, potentially, releasing, bound, arsenic, redox, reactions, involving, fe, also, appear, to, be, essential, factors, in, the, fate, of, arsenic, in, aquatic, systems, the, reduction, of, iron, oxyhydroxides, plays, a, key, role, in, the, release, of, arsenic, to, water, so, arsenic, can, be, enriched, in, water, with, elevated, fe, concentrations, under, oxidizing, conditions, arsenic, can, be, mobilized, from, pyrite, or, iron, oxides, especially, at, elevated, ph, under, reducing, conditions, arsenic, can, be, mobilized, by, reductive, desorption, or, dissolution, when, associated, with, iron, oxides, the, reductive, desorption, occurs, under, two, circumstances, one, is, when, arsenate, is, reduced, to, arsenite, which, adsorbs, to, iron, oxides, less, strongly, the, other, results, from, a, change, in, the, charge, on, the, mineral, surface, which, leads, to, the, desorption, of, bound, arsenic, some, species, of, bacteria, catalyze, redox, transformations, of, arsenic, dissimilatory, arsenate, respiring, prokaryotes, darp, speed, up, the, reduction, of, as, v, to, as, iii, darp, use, as, v, as, the, electron, acceptor, of, anaerobic, respiration, and, obtain, energy, to, survive, other, organic, and, inorganic, substances, can, be, oxidized, in, this, process, chemoautotrophic, arsenite, oxidizers, cao, and, heterotrophic, arsenite, oxidizers, hao, convert, as, iii, into, as, v, cao, combine, the, oxidation, of, as, iii, with, the, reduction, of, oxygen, or, nitrate, they, use, obtained, energy, to, fix, produce, organic, carbon, from, co, 2, hao, cannot, obtain, energy, from, as, iii, oxidation, this, process, may, be, an, arsenic, detoxification, mechanism, for, the, bacteria, equilibrium, thermodynamic, calculations, predict, that, as, v, concentrations, should, be, greater, than, as, iii, concentrations, in, all, but, strongly, reducing, conditions, i, e, where, sulfate, reduction, is, occurring, however, abiotic, redox, reactions, of, arsenic, are, slow, oxidation, of, as, iii, by, dissolved, o, 2, is, a, particularly, slow, reaction, for, example, johnson, and, pilson, 1975, gave, half, lives, for, the, oxygenation, of, as, iii, in, seawater, ranging, from, several, months, to, a, year, in, other, studies, as, v, as, iii, ratios, were, stable, over, periods, of, days, or, weeks, during, water, sampling, when, no, particular, care, was, taken, to, prevent, oxidation, again, suggesting, relatively, slow, oxidation, rates, cherry, found, from, experimental, studies, that, the, as, v, as, iii, ratios, were, stable, in, anoxic, solutions, for, up, to, 3, weeks, but, that, gradual, changes, occurred, over, longer, timescales, sterile, water, samples, have, been, observed, to, be, less, susceptible, to, speciation, changes, than, non, sterile, samples, oremland, found, that, the, reduction, of, as, v, to, as, iii, in, mono, lake, was, rapidly, catalyzed, by, bacteria, with, rate, constants, ranging, from, 0, 02, to, 0, 3, day, 1, as, of, 2002, us, based, industries, consumed, 19, 600, metric, tons, of, arsenic, ninety, percent, of, this, was, used, for, treatment, of, wood, with, chromated, copper, arsenate, cca, in, 2007, 50, of, the, 5, 280, metric, tons, of, consumption, was, still, used, for, this, purpose, in, the, united, states, the, voluntary, phasing, out, of, arsenic, in, production, of, consumer, products, and, residential, and, general, consumer, construction, products, began, on, 31, december, 2003, and, alternative, chemicals, are, now, used, such, as, alkaline, copper, quaternary, borates, copper, azole, cyproconazole, and, propiconazole, although, discontinued, this, application, is, also, one, of, the, most, concerning, to, the, general, public, the, vast, majority, of, older, pressure, treated, wood, was, treated, with, cca, cca, lumber, is, still, in, widespread, use, in, many, countries, and, was, heavily, used, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, a, structural, and, outdoor, building, material, although, the, use, of, cca, lumber, was, banned, in, many, areas, after, studies, showed, that, arsenic, could, leach, out, of, the, wood, into, the, surrounding, soil, from, playground, equipment, for, instance, a, risk, is, also, presented, by, the, burning, of, older, cca, timber, the, direct, or, indirect, ingestion, of, wood, ash, from, burnt, cca, lumber, has, caused, fatalities, in, animals, and, serious, poisonings, in, humans, the, lethal, human, dose, is, approximately, 20, grams, of, ash, scrap, cca, lumber, from, construction, and, demolition, sites, may, be, inadvertently, used, in, commercial, and, domestic, fires, protocols, for, safe, disposal, of, cca, lumber, are, not, consistent, throughout, the, world, widespread, landfill, disposal, of, such, timber, raises, some, concern, but, other, studies, have, shown, no, arsenic, contamination, in, the, groundwater, one, tool, that, maps, the, location, and, other, information, of, arsenic, releases, in, the, united, states, is, toxmap, toxmap, is, a, geographic, information, system, gis, from, the, division, of, specialized, information, services, of, the, united, states, national,

toxicology, data, network, toxnet, pubmed, and, from, other, authoritative, sources, physical, chemical, and, biological, methods, have, been, used, to, remediate, arsenic, contaminated, water, bioremediation, is, said, to, be, cost, effective, and, environmentally, friendly, bioremediation, of, ground, water, contaminated, with, arsenic, aims, to, convert, arsenite, the, toxic, form, of, arsenic, to, humans, to, arsenate, arsenate, 5, oxidation, state, is, the, dominant, form, of, arsenic, in, surface, water, while, arsenite, 3, oxidation, state, is, the, dominant, form, in, hypoxic, to, anoxic, environments, arsenite, is, more, soluble, and, mobile, than, arsenate, many, species, of, bacteria, can, transform, arsenite, to, arsenate, in, anoxic, conditions, by, using, arsenite, as, an, electron, donor, this, is, a, useful, method, in, ground, water, remediation, another, bioremediation, strategy, is, to, use, plants, that, accumulate, arsenic, in, their, tissues, via, phytoremediation, but, the, disposal, of, contaminated, plant, material, needs, to, be, considered, bioremediation, requires, careful, evaluation, and, design, in, accordance, with, existing, conditions, some, sites, may, require, the, addition, of, an, electron, acceptor, while, others, require, microbe, supplementation, bioaugmentation, regardless, of, the, method, used, only, constant, monitoring, can, prevent, future, contamination, coagulation, and, flocculation, are, closely, related, processes, common, in, arsenate, removal, from, water, due, to, the, net, negative, charge, carried, by, arsenate, ions, they, settle, slowly, or, not, at, all, due, to, charge, repulsion, in, coagulation, a, positively, charged, coagulent, such, as, iron, and, aluminum, commonly, used, salts, fecl, 3, fe, 2, so, 4, 3, al, 2, so, 4, 3, neutralize, the, negatively, charged, arsenate, enable, it, to, settle, flocculation, follows, where, a, flocculant, bridges, smaller, particles, and, allows, the, aggregate, to, precipitate, out, from, water, however, such, methods, may, not, be, efficient, on, arsenite, as, as, iii, exists, in, uncharged, arsenious, acid, h, 3, aso, 3, at, near, neutral, ph, the, major, drawbacks, of, coagulation, and, flocculation, are, the, costly, disposal, of, arsenate, concentrated, sludge, and, possible, secondary, contamination, of, environment, moreover, coagulents, such, as, iron, may, produce, ion, contamination, that, exceeds, safety, levels, arsenic, and, many, of, its, compounds, are, especially, potent, poisons, e, g, arsine, small, amount, of, arsenic, can, be, detected, by, pharmacopoial, methods, which, includes, reduction, of, arsenic, to, arsenious, with, help, of, zinc, and, can, be, confirmed, with, mercuric, chloride,

webs, in, polluted, areas, plant, growth, may, be, affected, by, root, uptake, of, arsenate, which, is, a, phosphate, analog, and, therefore, readily, transported, in, plant, tissues, and, cells, in, polluted, areas, uptake, of, the, more, toxic, arsenite, ion, found, more, particularly, in, reducing, conditions, is, likely, in, poorly, drained, soils, ip, administered, intraperitoneally, arsenic, s, toxicity, comes, from, the, affinity, of, arsenic, iii, oxides, for, thiols, thiols, in, the, form, of, cysteine, residues, and, cofactors, such, as, lipoic, acid, and, coenzyme, a, are, situated, at, the, active, sites, of, many, important, enzymes, arsenic, disrupts, atp, production, through, several, mechanisms, at, the, level, of, the, citric, acid, cycle, arsenic, inhibits, lipoic, acid, which, is, a, cofactor, for, pyruvate, dehydrogenase, by, competing, with, phosphate, arsenate, uncouples, oxidative, phosphorylation, thus, inhibiting, energy, linked, reduction, of, nad, mitochondrial, respiration, and, atp, synthesis, hydrogen, peroxide, production, is, also, increased, which, it, is, speculated, has, potential, to, form, reactive, oxygen, species, and, oxidative, stress, these, metabolic, interferences, lead, to, death, from, multi, system, organ, failure, the, organ, failure, is, presumed, to, be, from, necrotic, cell, death, not, apoptosis, since, energy, reserves, have, been, too, depleted, for, apoptosis, to, occur, occupational, exposure, and, arsenic, poisoning, may, occur, in, persons, working, in, industries, involving, the, use, of, inorganic, arsenic, and, its, compounds, such, as, wood, preservation, glass, production, nonferrous, metal, alloys, and, electronic, semiconductor, manufacturing, inorganic, arsenic, is, also, found, in, coke, oven, emissions, associated, with, the, smelter, industry, the, conversion, between, as, iii, and, as, v, is, a, large, factor, in, arsenic, environmental, contamination, according, to, croal, gralnick, malasarn, and, newman, understanding, what, stimulates, as, iii, oxidation, and, or, limits, as, v, reduction, is, relevant, for, bioremediation, of, contaminated, sites, croal, the, study, of, chemolithoautotrophic, as, iii, oxidizers, and, the, heterotrophic, as, v, reducers, can, help, the, understanding, of, the, oxidation, and, or, reduction, of, arsenic, treatment, of, chronic, arsenic, poisoning, is, possible, british, anti, lewisite, dimercaprol, is, prescribed, in, doses, of, 5, mg, kg, up, to, 300, mg, every, 4, hours, for, the, first, day, then, every, 6, hours, for, the, second, day, and, finally, every, 8, hours, for, 8, additional, days, however, the, usa, s, agency, for, toxic, substances, and, disease, registry, atsdr, states, that, the, long, term, effects, of, arsenic, exposure, cannot, be, predicted, blood, urine, hair, and, nails, may, be, tested, for, arsenic, however, these, tests, cannot, foresee, possible, health, outcomes, from, the, exposure, long, term, exposure, and, consequent, excretion, through, urine, has, been, linked, to, bladder, and, kidney, cancer, in, addition, to, cancer, of, the, liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and, nasal,
