organosulfur, chemistry, is, the, study, of, the, properties, and, synthesis, of, organosulfur, compounds, which, are, organic, compounds, that, contain, sulfur, they, are, often, associated, with, foul, odors, but, many, of, the, sweetest, compounds, known, are, organosulfur, derivatives, e, g, saccharin, nature, is, abound, with, organosulfur, compounds, sulfur, is, vital, for, life, of, the, 20, common, amino, acids, two, cysteine, and, methionine, are, organosulfur, compounds, and, the, antibiotics, penicillin, and, sulfa, drugs, both, contain, sulfur, while, sulfur, containing, antibiotics, save, many, lives, sulfur, mustard, is, a, deadly, chemical, warfare, agent, fossil, fuels, coal, petroleum, and, natural, gas, which, are, derived, from, ancient, organisms, necessarily, contain, organosulfur, compounds, the, removal, of, which, is, a, major, focus, of, oil, refineries, sulfur, shares, the, chalcogen, group, with, oxygen, selenium, and, tellurium, and, it, is, expected, that, organosulfur, compounds, have, similarities, with, carbon, oxygen, carbon, selenium, and, carbon, tellurium, compounds, a, classical, chemical, test, for, the, detection, of, sulfur, compounds, is, the, carius, halogen, method, organosulfur, compounds, can, be, classified, according, to, the, sulfur, containing, functional, groups, which, are, listed, approximately, in, decreasing, order, of, their, occurrence, sulfides, formerly, known, as, thioethers, are, characterized, by, c, s, c, bonds, relative, to, c, c, bonds, c, s, bonds, are, both, longer, because, sulfur, atoms, are, larger, than, carbon, atoms, and, about, 10, weaker, representative, bond, lengths, in, sulfur, compounds, are, 183, pm, for, the, s, c, single, bond, in, methanethiol, and, 173, pm, in, thiophene, the, c, s, bond, dissociation, energy, for, thiomethane, is, 89, kcal, mol, 370, kj, mol, compared, to, methane, s, 100, kcal, mol, 420, kj, mol, and, when, hydrogen, is, replaced, by, a, methyl, group, the, energy, decreases, to, 73, kcal, mol, 305, kj, mol, the, single, carbon, to, oxygen, bond, is, shorter, than, that, of, the, c, c, bond, the, bond, dissociation, energies, for, dimethyl, sulfide, and, dimethyl, ether, are, respectively, 73, and, 77, kcal, mol, 305, and, 322, kj, mol, sulfides, are, typically, prepared, by, alkylation, of, thiols, alkylating, agents, include, not, only, alkyl, halides, but, also, epoxides, aziridines, and, michael, acceptors, they, can, also, be, prepared, via, the, pummerer, rearrangement, in, the, ferrario, reaction, phenyl, ether, is, converted, to, phenoxathiin, by, action, of, elemental, sulfur, and, aluminium, chloride, thioacetals, and, thioketals, feature, c, s, c, s, c, bond, sequence, they, represent, a, subclass, of, sulfides, the, thioacetals, are, useful, in, umpolung, of, carbonyl, groups, thioacetals, and, thioketals, can, also, be, used, to, protect, a, carbonyl, group, in, organic, syntheses, the, above, classes, of, sulfur, compounds, also, exist, in, saturated, and, unsaturated, heterocyclic, structures, often, in, combination, with, other, heteroatoms, as, illustrated, by, thiiranes, thiirenes, thietanes, thietes, dithietanes, thiolanes, thianes, dithianes, thiepanes, thiepines, thiazoles, isothiazoles, and, thiophenes, among, others, the, latter, three, compounds, represent, a, special, class, of, sulfur, containing, heterocycles, that, are, aromatic, the, resonance, stabilization, of, thiophene, is, 29, kcal, mol, 121, kj, mol, compared, to, 20, kcal, mol, 84, kj, mol, for, the, oxygen, analogue, furan, the, reason, for, this, difference, is, the, higher, electronegativity, for, oxygen, drawing, away, electrons, to, itself, at, the, expense, of, the, aromatic, ring, current, yet, as, an, aromatic, substituent, the, thio, group, is, less, electron, releasing, than, the, alkoxy, group, dibenzothiophenes, see, drawing, tricyclic, heterocycles, consisting, of, two, benzene, rings, fused, to, a, central, thiophene, ring, occurs, widely, in, heavier, fractions, of, petroleum, thiol, groups, contain, the, functionality, r, sh, thiols, are, structurally, similar, to, the, alcohol, group, but, these, functionalities, are, very, different, in, their, chemical, properties, thiols, are, more, nucleophilic, more, acidic, and, more, readily, oxidized, this, acidity, can, differ, by, 5, p, k, a, units, the, difference, in, electronegativity, between, sulfur, 2, 58, and, hydrogen, 2, 20, is, small, and, therefore, hydrogen, bonding, in, thiols, is, not, prominent, aliphatic, thiols, form, monolayers, on, gold, which, are, topical, in, nanotechnology, certain, aromatic, thiols, can, be, accessed, through, a, herz, reaction, disulfides, r, s, s, r, with, a, covalent, sulfur, to, sulfur, bond, are, important, for, crosslinking, in, biochemistry, for, the, folding, and, stability, of, some, proteins, and, in, polymer, chemistry, for, the, crosslinking, of, rubber, longer, sulfur, chains, are, also, known, such, as, in, the, natural, product, varacin, which, contains, an, unusual, pentathiepin, ring, 5, sulfur, chain, cyclised, onto, a, benzene, ring, thioesters, have, general, structure, r, c, o, s, r, they, are, related, to, regular, esters, r, c, o, o, r, but, are, more, susceptible, to, hydrolysis, and, related, reactions, thioesters, formed, from, coenzyme, a, are, prominent, in, biochemistry, especially, in, fatty, acid, synthesis, a, sulfoxide, r, s, o, r, is, the, s, oxide, of, a, sulfide, sulfide, oxide, a, sulfone, r, s, o, 2, r, is,
