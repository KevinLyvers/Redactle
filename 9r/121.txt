sirius, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, its, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, latin, script, seirios, meaning, lit, glowing, or, scorching, the, star, is, designated, canis, majoris, latinized, to, alpha, canis, majoris, and, abbreviated, cma, or, alpha, cma, with, a, visual, apparent, magnitude, of, 1, 46, sirius, is, almost, twice, as, bright, as, canopus, the, next, brightest, star, sirius, is, a, binary, star, consisting, of, a, main, sequence, star, of, spectral, type, a0, or, a1, termed, sirius, a, and, a, faint, white, dwarf, companion, of, spectral, type, da2, termed, sirius, b, the, distance, between, the, two, varies, between, 8, 2, and, 31, 5, astronomical, units, as, they, orbit, every, 50, years, sirius, appears, bright, because, of, its, intrinsic, luminosity, and, its, proximity, to, the, solar, system, at, a, distance, of, 2, 64, parsecs, 8, 6, ly, the, sirius, system, is, one, of, earth, s, nearest, neighbours, sirius, is, gradually, moving, closer, to, the, solar, system, it, is, expected, to, increase, in, brightness, slightly, over, the, next, 60, 000, years, to, reach, a, peak, magnitude, of, 1, 68, coincidentally, at, about, the, same, time, sirius, will, take, its, turn, as, the, southern, pole, star, around, the, year, 66, 270, ad, in, that, year, sirius, will, come, to, within, 1, 6, degrees, of, the, south, celestial, pole, this, is, due, to, axial, precession, and, proper, motion, of, sirius, itself, which, moves, slowly, in, the, ssw, direction, so, it, will, be, visible, from, the, southern, hemisphere, only, after, that, time, its, distance, will, begin, to, increase, and, it, will, become, fainter, but, it, will, continue, to, be, the, brightest, star, in, the, earth, s, night, sky, for, approximately, the, next, 210, 000, years, at, which, point, vega, another, a, type, star, that, is, intrinsically, more, luminous, than, sirius, becomes, the, brightest, star, sirius, a, is, about, twice, as, massive, as, the, sun, m, and, has, an, absolute, visual, magnitude, of, 1, 43, it, is, 25, times, as, luminous, as, the, sun, but, has, a, significantly, lower, luminosity, than, other, bright, stars, such, as, canopus, betelgeuse, or, rigel, the, system, is, between, 200, and, 300, million, years, old, it, was, originally, composed, of, two, bright, bluish, stars, the, initially, more, massive, of, these, sirius, b, consumed, its, hydrogen, fuel, and, became, a, red, giant, before, shedding, its, outer, layers, and, collapsing, into, its, current, state, as, a, white, dwarf, around, 120, million, years, ago, sirius, is, colloquially, known, as, the, dog, star, reflecting, its, prominence, in, its, constellation, canis, major, the, greater, dog, the, heliacal, rising, of, sirius, marked, the, flooding, of, the, nile, in, ancient, egypt, and, the, dog, days, of, summer, for, the, ancient, greeks, while, to, the, polynesians, mostly, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, star, marked, winter, and, was, an, important, reference, for, their, navigation, around, the, pacific, ocean, as, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, sirius, appears, in, some, of, the, earliest, astronomical, records, its, displacement, from, the, ecliptic, causes, its, heliacal, rising, to, be, remarkably, regular, compared, to, other, stars, with, a, period, of, almost, exactly, 365, 25, days, holding, it, constant, relative, to, the, solar, year, this, rising, occurs, at, cairo, on, 19, july, julian, placing, it, just, before, the, onset, of, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, during, antiquity, owing, to, the, flood, s, own, irregularity, the, extreme, precision, of, the, star, s, return, made, it, important, to, the, ancient, egyptians, who, worshipped, it, as, the, goddess, sopdet, ancient, egyptian, spdt, triangle, greek, s, this, guarantor, of, the, fertility, of, their, land, the, ancient, greeks, observed, that, the, appearance, of, sirius, as, the, morning, star, heralded, the, hot, and, dry, summer, and, feared, that, the, star, caused, plants, to, wilt, men, to, weaken, and, women, to, become, aroused, owing, to, its, brightness, sirius, would, have, been, seen, to, twinkle, more, in, the, unsettled, weather, conditions, of, early, summer, to, greek, observers, this, signified, emanations, that, caused, its, malignant, influence, anyone, suffering, its, effects, was, said, to, be, star, struck, astrob, l, tos, it, was, described, as, burning, or, flaming, in, literature, the, season, following, the, star, s, reappearance, came, to, be, known, as, the, dog, days, the, inhabitants, of, the, island, of, ceos, in, the, aegean, sea, would, offer, sacrifices, to, sirius, and, zeus, to, bring, cooling, breezes, and, would, await, the, reappearance, of, the, star, in, summer, if, it, rose, clear, it, would, portend, good, fortune, if, it, was, misty, or, faint, then, it, foretold, or, emanated, pestilence, coins, retrieved, from, the, island, from, the, 3rd, century, bc, feature, dogs, or, stars, with, emanating, rays, highlighting, sirius, s, importance, the, romans, celebrated, the, heliacal, setting, of, sirius, around, 25, april, sacrificing, a, dog, along, with, incense, wine, and, a, sheep, to, the, goddess, robigo, so, that, the, star, s, emanations, would, not, cause, wheat, rust, on, wheat, crops, that, year, bright, stars, were, important, to, the, ancient, polynesians, for, navigation, of, the, pacific, ocean, they, also, served, as, latitude, markers, the, declination, of, sirius, matches, the, latitude, of, the, archipelago, of, fiji, at, 17, s, and, thus, passes, directly, over, the, islands, each, sidereal, day, sirius, served, as, the, body, of, a, great, bird, constellation, called, manu, with, canopus, as, the, southern, wingtip, and, procyon, the, northern, wingtip, which, divided, the, polynesian, night, sky, into, two, hemispheres, just, as, the, appearance, of, sirius, in, the, morning, sky, marked, summer, in, greece, it, marked, the, onset, of, winter, for, the, m, ori, whose, name, takurua, described, both, the, star, and, the, season, its, culmination, at, the, winter, solstice, was, marked, by, celebration, in, hawaii, where, it, was, known, as, ka, ulua, queen, of, heaven, many, other, polynesian, names, have, been, recorded, including, tau, ua, in, the, marquesas, islands, rehua, in, new, zealand, and, ta, urua, fau, papa, festivity, of, original, high, chiefs, and, ta, urua, e, hiti, i, te, tara, te, feiai, festivity, who, rises, with, prayers, and, religious, ceremonies, in, tahiti, in, 1717, edmond, halley, discovered, the, proper, motion, of, the, hitherto, presumed, fixed, stars, after, comparing, contemporary, astrometric, measurements, with, those, from, the, second, century, ad, given, in, ptolemy, s, almagest, the, bright, stars, aldebaran, arcturus, and, sirius, were, noted, to, have, moved, significantly, sirius, had, progressed, about, 30, arcminutes, about, the, diameter, of, the, moon, to, the, southwest, in, 1868, sirius, became, the, first, star, to, have, its, velocity, measured, the, beginning, of, the, study, of, celestial, radial, velocities, sir, william, huggins, examined, the, spectrum, of, the, star, and, observed, a, red, shift, he, concluded, that, sirius, was, receding, from, the, solar, system, at, about, 40, km, s, compared, to, the, modern, value, of, 5, 5, km, s, this, was, an, overestimate, and, had, the, wrong, sign, the, minus, sign, means, that, it, is, approaching, the, sun, in, his, 1698, book, cosmotheoros, christiaan, huygens, estimated, the, distance, to, sirius, at, 27, 664, times, the, distance, from, the, earth, to, the, sun, about, 0, 437, light, year, translating, to, a, parallax, of, roughly, 7, 5, arcseconds, there, were, several, unsuccessful, attempts, to, measure, the, parallax, of, sirius, by, jacques, cassini, 6, seconds, by, some, astronomers, including, nevil, maskelyne, using, lacaille, s, observations, made, at, the, cape, of, good, hope, 4, seconds, by, piazzi, the, same, amount, using, lacaille, s, observations, made, at, paris, more, numerous, and, certain, than, those, made, at, the, cape, no, sensible, parallax, by, bessel, no, sensible, parallax, scottish, astronomer, thomas, henderson, used, his, observations, made, in, 1832, 1833, and, south, african, astronomer, thomas, maclear, s, observations, made, in, 1836, 1837, to, determine, that, the, value, of, the, parallax, was, 0, 23, arcsecond, and, error, of, the, parallax, was, estimated, not, to, exceed, a, quarter, of, a, second, or, as, henderson, wrote, in, 1839, on, the, whole, we, may, conclude, that, the, parallax, of, sirius, is, not, greater, than, half, a, second, in, space, and, that, it, is, probably, much, less, astronomers, adopted, a, value, of, 0, 25, arcsecond, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, it, is, now, known, to, have, a, parallax, of, nearly, 0, 4, arcseconds, the, hipparcos, parallax, for, sirius, is, only, accurate, to, about, 0, 04, light, years, giving, a, distance, of, 8, 6, light, years, sirius, b, is, generally, assumed, to, be, at, the, same, distance, sirius, b, has, a, gaia, data, release, 3, parallax, with, a, much, smaller, statistical, margin, of, error, giving, a, distance, of, 8, 709, 0, 005, light, years, but, it, is, flagged, as, having, a, very, large, value, for, astrometric, excess, noise, which, indicates, that, the, parallax, value, may, be, unreliable, in, a, letter, dated, 10, august, 1844, the, german, astronomer, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, deduced, from, changes, in, the, proper, motion, of, sirius, that, it, had, an, unseen, companion, on, 31, january, 1862, american, telescope, maker, and, astronomer, alvan, graham, clark, first, observed, the, faint, companion, which, is, now, called, sirius, b, or, affectionately, the, pup, this, happened, during, testing, of, an, 18, 5, inch, 470, mm, aperture, great, refractor, telescope, for, dearborn, observatory, which, was, one, of, the, largest, refracting, telescope, lenses, in, existence, at, the, time, and, the, largest, telescope, in, the, united, states, sirius, b, s, sighting, was, confirmed, on, 8, march, with, smaller, telescopes, the, visible, star, is, now, sometimes, known, as, sirius, a, since, 1894, some, apparent, orbital, irregularities, in, the, sirius, system, have, been, observed, suggesting, a, third, very, small, companion, star, but, this, has, never, been, confirmed, the, best, fit, to, the, data, indicates, a, six, year, orbit, around, sirius, a, and, a, mass, of, 0, 06, m, this, star, would, be, five, to, ten, magnitudes, fainter, than, the, white, dwarf, sirius, b, which, would, make, it, difficult, to, observe, observations, published, in, 2008, were, unable, to, detect, either, a, third, star, or, a, planet, an, apparent, third, star, observed, in, the, 1920s, is, now, believed, to, be, a, background, object, in, 1915, walter, sydney, adams, using, a, 60, inch, 1, 5, m, reflector, at, mount, wilson, observatory, observed, the, spectrum, of, sirius, b, and, determined, that, it, was, a, faint, whitish, star, this, led, astronomers, to, conclude, that, it, was, a, white, dwarf, the, second, to, be, discovered, the, diameter, of, sirius, a, was, first, measured, by, robert, hanbury, brown, and, richard, q, twiss, in, 1959, at, jodrell, bank, using, their, stellar, intensity, interferometer, in, 2005, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, astronomers, determined, that, sirius, b, has, nearly, the, diameter, of, the, earth, 12, 000, kilometres, 7, 500, mi, with, a, mass, 102, of, the, sun, s, around, the, year, 150, ad, claudius, ptolemy, of, alexandria, an, ethnic, greek, egyptian, astronomer, of, the, roman, period, mapped, the, stars, in, books, vii, and, viii, of, his, almagest, in, which, he, used, sirius, as, the, location, for, the, globe, s, central, meridian, he, described, sirius, as, reddish, along, with, five, other, stars, betelgeuse, antares, aldebaran, arcturus, and, pollux, all, of, which, are, at, present, observed, to, be, of, orange, or, red, hue, the, discrepancy, was, first, noted, by, amateur, astronomer, thomas, barker, squire, of, lyndon, hall, in, rutland, who, prepared, a, paper, and, spoke, at, a, meeting, of, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1760, the, existence, of, other, stars, changing, in, brightness, gave, credibility, to, the, idea, that, some, may, change, in, colour, too, sir, john, herschel, noted, this, in, 1839, possibly, influenced, by, witnessing, eta, carinae, two, years, earlier, thomas, j, j, see, resurrected, discussion, on, red, sirius, with, the, publication, of, several, papers, in, 1892, and, a, final, summary, in, 1926, he, cited, not, only, ptolemy, but, also, the, poet, aratus, the, orator, cicero, and, general, germanicus, all, calling, the, star, red, though, acknowledging, that, none, of, the, latter, three, authors, were, astronomers, the, last, two, merely, translating, aratus, s, poem, phaenomena, seneca, had, described, sirius, as, being, of, a, deeper, red, than, mars, it, is, therefore, possible, that, the, description, as, red, is, a, poetic, metaphor, for, ill, fortune, in, 1985, german, astronomers, wolfhard, schlosser, and, werner, bergmann, published, an, account, of, an, 8th, century, lombardic, manuscript, which, contains, de, cursu, stellarum, ratio, by, st, gregory, of, tours, the, latin, text, taught, readers, how, to, determine, the, times, of, nighttime, prayers, from, positions, of, the, stars, and, a, bright, star, described, as, rubeola, reddish, was, claimed, to, be, sirius, the, authors, proposed, this, as, evidence, that, sirius, b, had, been, a, red, giant, at, the, time, of, observation, other, scholars, replied, that, it, was, likely, st, gregory, had, been, referring, to, arcturus, it, is, notable, that, not, all, ancient, observers, saw, sirius, as, red, the, 1st, century, poet, marcus, manilius, described, it, as, sea, blue, as, did, the, 4th, century, avienius, furthermore, sirius, was, consistently, reported, as, a, white, star, in, ancient, china, a, detailed, re, evaluation, of, chinese, texts, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, up, to, the, 7th, century, ad, concluded, that, all, such, reliable, sources, are, consistent, with, sirius, being, white, nevertheless, historical, accounts, referring, to, sirius, as, red, are, sufficiently, extensive, to, lead, researchers, to, seek, possible, physical, explanations, proposed, theories, fall, into, two, categories, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, intrinsic, theories, postulate, a, real, change, in, the, sirius, system, over, the, past, two, millennia, of, which, the, most, widely, discussed, is, the, proposal, that, the, white, dwarf, sirius, b, was, a, red, giant, as, recently, as, 2000, years, ago, extrinsic, theories, are, concerned, with, the, possibility, of, transient, reddening, in, an, intervening, medium, through, which, the, star, is, observed, such, as, might, be, caused, by, dust, in, the, interstellar, medium, or, by, particles, in, the, terrestrial, atmosphere, the, possibility, that, stellar, evolution, of, either, sirius, a, or, sirius, b, could, be, responsible, for, the, discrepancy, has, been, rejected, on, the, grounds, that, the, timescale, of, thousands, of, years, is, orders, of, magnitude, too, short, and, that, there, is, no, sign, of, the, nebulosity, in, the, system, that, would, be, expected, had, such, a, change, taken, place, similarly, the, presence, of, a, third, star, sufficiently, luminous, to, affect, the, visible, colour, of, the, system, in, recent, millennia, is, inconsistent, with, observational, evidence, intrinsic, theories, may, therefore, be, disregarded, extrinsic, theories, based, on, reddening, by, interstellar, dust, are, similarly, implausible, a, transient, dust, cloud, passing, between, the, sirius, system, and, an, observer, on, earth, would, indeed, redden, the, appearance, of, the, star, to, some, degree, but, reddening, sufficient, to, cause, it, to, appear, similar, in, colour, to, intrinsically, red, bright, stars, such, as, betelgeuse, and, arcturus, would, also, dim, the, star, by, several, magnitudes, inconsistent, with, historical, accounts, indeed, the, dimming, would, be, sufficient, to, render, the, colour, of, the, star, imperceptible, to, the, human, eye, without, the, aid, of, a, telescope, extrinsic, theories, based, on, optical, effects, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, are, better, supported, by, available, evidence, scintillations, caused, by, atmospheric, turbulence, result, in, rapid, transient, changes, in, the, apparent, colour, of, the, star, especially, when, observed, near, the, horizon, although, with, no, particular, preference, for, red, however, systematic, reddening, of, the, star, s, light, results, from, absorption, and, scattering, by, particles, in, the, atmosphere, exactly, analogous, to, the, redness, of, the, sun, at, sunrise, and, sunset, because, the, particles, that, cause, reddening, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, are, different, typically, much, smaller, than, those, that, cause, reddening, in, the, interstellar, medium, there, is, far, less, dimming, of, the, starlight, and, in, the, case, of, sirius, the, change, in, colour, can, be, seen, without, the, aid, of, a, telescope, there, may, be, cultural, reasons, to, explain, why, some, ancient, observers, might, have, reported, the, colour, of, sirius, preferentially, when, it, was, situated, low, in, the, sky, and, therefore, apparently, red, in, several, mediterranean, cultures, the, local, visibility, of, sirius, at, heliacal, rising, and, setting, whether, it, appeared, bright, and, clear, or, dimmed, was, thought, to, have, astrological, significance, and, was, thus, subject, to, systematic, observation, and, intense, interest, thus, sirius, more, than, any, other, star, was, observed, and, recorded, while, close, to, the, horizon, other, contemporary, cultures, such, as, chinese, lacking, this, tradition, recorded, sirius, only, as, white, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 1, 46, sirius, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, almost, twice, as, bright, as, the, second, brightest, star, canopus, from, earth, sirius, always, appears, dimmer, than, jupiter, and, venus, and, at, certain, times, also, dimmer, than, mercury, and, mars, sirius, is, visible, from, almost, everywhere, on, earth, except, latitudes, north, of, 73, n, and, it, does, not, rise, very, high, when, viewed, from, some, northern, cities, reaching, only, 13, above, the, horizon, from, saint, petersburg, because, of, its, declination, of, roughly, 17, sirius, is, a, circumpolar, star, from, latitudes, south, of, 73, s, from, the, southern, hemisphere, in, early, july, sirius, can, be, seen, in, both, the, evening, where, it, sets, after, the, sun, and, in, the, morning, where, it, rises, before, the, sun, along, with, procyon, and, betelgeuse, sirius, forms, one, of, the, three, vertices, of, the, winter, triangle, to, observers, in, the, northern, hemisphere, sirius, can, be, observed, in, daylight, with, the, naked, eye, under, the, right, conditions, ideally, the, sky, should, be, very, clear, with, the, observer, at, a, high, altitude, the, star, passing, overhead, and, the, sun, low, on, the, horizon, these, observing, conditions, are, more, easily, met, in, the, southern, hemisphere, owing, to, the, southerly, declination, of, sirius, the, orbital, motion, of, the, sirius, binary, system, brings, the, two, stars, to, a, minimum, angular, separation, of, 3, arcseconds, and, a, maximum, of, 11, arcseconds, at, the, closest, approach, it, is, an, observational, challenge, to, distinguish, the, white, dwarf, from, its, more, luminous, companion, requiring, a, telescope, with, at, least, 300, mm, 12, in, aperture, and, excellent, seeing, conditions, after, a, periastron, occurred, in, 1994, the, pair, moved, apart, making, them, easier, to, separate, with, a, telescope, apoastron, occurred, in, 2019, but, from, the, earth, s, vantage, point, the, greatest, observational, separation, occurred, in, 2023, with, an, angular, separation, of, 11, 333, at, a, distance, of, 2, 6, parsecs, 8, 6, ly, the, sirius, system, contains, two, of, the, eight, nearest, stars, to, the, sun, and, it, is, the, fifth, closest, stellar, system, to, the, sun, this, proximity, is, the, main, reason, for, its, brightness, as, with, other, near, stars, such, as, alpha, centauri, procyon, and, vega, and, in, contrast, to, distant, highly, luminous, supergiants, such, as, canopus, rigel, or, betelgeuse, although, canopus, may, be, a, bright, giant, it, is, still, around, 25, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, the, closest, large, neighbouring, star, to, sirius, is, procyon, 1, 61, parsecs, 5, 24, ly, away, the, voyager, 2, spacecraft, launched, in, 1977, to, study, the, four, giant, planets, in, the, solar, system, is, expected, to, pass, within, 4, 3, light, years, 1, 3, pc, of, sirius, in, approximately, 296, 000, years, sirius, is, a, binary, star, system, consisting, of, two, white, stars, orbiting, each, other, with, a, separation, of, about, 20, au, roughly, the, distance, between, the, sun, and, uranus, and, a, period, of, 50, 1, years, the, brighter, component, termed, sirius, a, is, a, main, sequence, star, of, spectral, type, early, a, with, an, estimated, surface, temperature, of, 9, 940, k, its, companion, sirius, b, is, a, star, that, has, already, evolved, off, the, main, sequence, and, become, a, white, dwarf, currently, 10, 000, times, less, luminous, in, the, visual, spectrum, sirius, b, was, once, the, more, massive, of, the, two, the, age, of, the, system, has, been, estimated, at, 230, million, years, early, in, its, life, it, is, thought, to, have, been, two, bluish, white, stars, orbiting, each, other, in, an, elliptical, orbit, every, 9, 1, years, the, system, emits, a, higher, than, expected, level, of, infrared, radiation, as, measured, by, iras, space, based, observatory, this, might, be, an, indication, of, dust, in, the, system, which, is, considered, somewhat, unusual, for, a, binary, star, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, image, shows, sirius, b, outshining, its, partner, as, an, x, ray, source, in, 2015, vigan, and, colleagues, used, the, vlt, survey, telescope, to, search, for, evidence, of, substellar, companions, and, were, able, to, rule, out, the, presence, of, giant, planets, 11, times, more, massive, than, jupiter, at, 0, 5, au, distance, from, sirius, a, 6, 7, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, at, 1, 2, au, distance, and, down, to, around, 4, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, at, 10, au, distance, similarly, lucas, and, colleagues, did, not, detect, any, companions, around, sirius, b, sirius, a, also, known, as, the, dog, star, has, a, mass, of, 2, 063, m, the, radius, of, this, star, has, been, measured, by, an, astronomical, interferometer, giving, an, estimated, angular, diameter, of, 5, 936, 0, 016, mas, the, projected, rotational, velocity, is, a, relatively, low, 16, km, s, which, does, not, produce, any, significant, flattening, of, its, disk, this, is, at, marked, variance, with, the, similar, sized, vega, which, rotates, at, a, much, faster, 274, km, s, and, bulges, prominently, around, its, equator, a, weak, magnetic, field, has, been, detected, on, the, surface, of, sirius, a, stellar, models, suggest, that, the, star, formed, during, the, collapsing, of, a, molecular, cloud, and, that, after, 10, million, years, its, internal, energy, generation, was, derived, entirely, from, nuclear, reactions, the, core, became, convective, and, used, the, cno, cycle, for, energy, generation, it, is, calculated, that, sirius, a, will, have, completely, exhausted, the, store, of, hydrogen, at, its, core, within, a, billion, 10, 9, years, of, its, formation, and, will, then, evolve, away, from, the, main, sequence, it, will, pass, through, a, red, giant, stage, and, eventually, become, a, white, dwarf, sirius, a, is, classed, as, a, type, am, star, because, the, spectrum, shows, deep, metallic, absorption, lines, indicating, an, enhancement, of, its, surface, layers, in, elements, heavier, than, helium, such, as, iron, the, spectral, type, has, been, reported, as, a0ma1, va, which, indicates, that, it, would, be, classified, as, a1, from, hydrogen, and, helium, lines, but, a0, from, the, metallic, lines, that, cause, it, to, be, grouped, with, the, am, stars, when, compared, to, the, sun, the, proportion, of, iron, in, the, atmosphere, of, sirius, a, relative, to, hydrogen, is, given, by, fe, h, 0, 5, displaystyle, textstyle, left, 0, 5, meaning, iron, is, 316, as, abundant, as, in, the, sun, s, atmosphere, the, high, surface, content, of, metallic, elements, is, unlikely, to, be, true, of, the, entire, star, rather, the, iron, peak, and, heavy, metals, are, radiatively, levitated, towards, the, surface, sirius, b, also, known, as, the, pup, star, is, one, of, the, most, massive, white, dwarfs, known, with, a, mass, of, 1, 02, m, it, is, almost, double, the, 0, 5, 0, 6, m, average, this, mass, is, packed, into, a, volume, roughly, equal, to, the, earth, s, the, current, surface, temperature, is, 25, 200, k, because, there, is, no, internal, heat, source, sirius, b, will, steadily, cool, as, the, remaining, heat, is, radiated, into, space, over, the, next, two, billion, years, or, so, a, white, dwarf, forms, after, a, star, has, evolved, from, the, main, sequence, and, then, passed, through, a, red, giant, stage, this, occurred, when, sirius, b, was, less, than, half, its, current, age, around, 120, million, years, ago, the, original, star, had, an, estimated, 5, m, and, was, a, b, type, star, most, likely, b5v, for, 5, m, when, it, was, still, on, the, main, sequence, potentially, burning, around, 600, 1200, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, while, it, passed, through, the, red, giant, stage, sirius, b, may, have, enriched, the, metallicity, of, its, companion, explaining, the, very, high, metallicity, of, sirius, a, this, star, is, primarily, composed, of, a, carbon, oxygen, mixture, that, was, generated, by, helium, fusion, in, the, progenitor, star, this, is, overlaid, by, an, envelope, of, lighter, elements, with, the, materials, segregated, by, mass, because, of, the, high, surface, gravity, the, outer, atmosphere, of, sirius, b, is, now, almost, pure, hydrogen, the, element, with, the, lowest, mass, and, no, other, elements, are, seen, in, its, spectrum, although, sirius, a, and, b, compose, a, binary, system, that, is, reminiscent, of, those, that, can, undergo, type, ia, supernova, the, two, stars, are, believed, to, be, too, far, apart, for, it, to, occur, even, if, sirius, a, swells, into, a, red, giant, novas, however, may, be, possible, since, 1894, irregularities, have, been, tentatively, observed, in, the, orbits, of, sirius, a, and, b, with, an, apparent, periodicity, of, 6, 6, 4, years, a, 1995, study, concluded, that, such, a, companion, likely, exists, with, a, mass, of, roughly, 0, 05, solar, mass, a, small, red, dwarf, or, large, brown, dwarf, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, more, than, 15, and, less, than, 3, arcseconds, from, sirius, a, in, 2017, more, accurate, astrometric, observations, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, ruled, out, the, existence, of, a, stellar, mass, sized, sirius, c, while, still, allowing, a, substellar, mass, candidate, such, as, a, lower, mass, brown, dwarf, the, 1995, study, predicted, an, astrometric, movement, of, roughly, 90, mas, 0, 09, arcsecond, but, hubble, was, unable, to, detect, any, location, anomaly, to, an, accuracy, of, 5, mas, 0, 005, arcsec, this, ruled, out, any, objects, orbiting, sirius, a, with, more, than, 0, 033, solar, mass, 35, jupiter, masses, in, 0, 5, years, and, 0, 014, 15, jupiter, masses, in, 2, years, the, study, was, also, able, to, rule, out, any, companions, to, sirius, b, with, more, than, 0, 024, solar, mass, 25, jupiter, masses, orbiting, in, 0, 5, year, and, 0, 0095, 10, jupiter, masses, orbiting, in, 1, 8, years, effectively, there, are, almost, certainly, no, additional, bodies, in, the, sirius, system, larger, than, a, small, brown, dwarf, or, large, exoplanet, in, 1909, ejnar, hertzsprung, was, the, first, to, suggest, that, sirius, was, a, member, of, the, ursa, major, moving, group, based, on, his, observations, of, the, system, s, movements, across, the, sky, the, ursa, major, group, is, a, set, of, 220, stars, that, share, a, common, motion, through, space, it, was, once, a, member, of, an, open, cluster, but, has, since, become, gravitationally, unbound, from, the, cluster, analyses, in, 2003, and, 2005, found, sirius, s, membership, in, the, group, to, be, questionable, the, ursa, major, group, has, an, estimated, age, of, 500, 100, million, years, whereas, sirius, with, metallicity, similar, to, the, sun, s, has, an, age, that, is, only, half, this, making, it, too, young, to, belong, to, the, group, sirius, may, instead, be, a, member, of, the, proposed, sirius, supercluster, along, with, other, scattered, stars, such, as, beta, aurigae, alpha, coronae, borealis, beta, crateris, beta, eridani, and, beta, serpentis, this, would, be, one, of, three, large, clusters, located, within, 500, light, years, 150, pc, of, the, sun, the, other, two, are, the, hyades, and, the, pleiades, and, each, of, these, clusters, consists, of, hundreds, of, stars, in, 2017, a, massive, star, cluster, was, discovered, only, 10, arcminutes, from, sirius, making, the, two, appear, to, be, visually, close, to, one, other, when, viewed, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, earth, it, was, discovered, during, a, statistical, analysis, of, gaia, data, the, cluster, is, over, a, thousand, times, further, away, from, us, than, the, star, system, but, given, its, size, it, still, appears, at, magnitude, 8, 3, the, proper, name, sirius, comes, from, the, latin, s, rius, from, the, ancient, greek, seirios, glowing, or, scorcher, the, greek, word, itself, may, have, been, imported, from, elsewhere, before, the, archaic, period, one, authority, suggesting, a, link, with, the, egyptian, god, osiris, the, name, s, earliest, recorded, use, dates, from, the, 7th, century, bc, in, hesiod, s, poetic, work, works, and, days, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, sirius, for, the, star, canis, majoris, a, it, is, now, so, entered, in, the, iau, catalog, of, star, names, sirius, has, over, 50, other, designations, and, names, attached, to, it, in, geoffrey, chaucer, s, essay, treatise, on, the, astrolabe, it, bears, the, name, alhabor, and, is, depicted, by, a, hound, s, head, this, name, is, widely, used, on, medieval, astrolabes, from, western, europe, in, sanskrit, it, is, known, as, mrgavyadha, deer, hunter, or, lubdhaka, hunter, as, mrgavyadha, the, star, represents, rudra, shiva, the, star, is, referred, to, as, makarajyoti, in, malayalam, and, has, religious, significance, to, the, pilgrim, center, sabarimala, in, scandinavia, the, star, has, been, known, as, lokabrenna, burning, done, by, loki, or, loki, s, torch, in, the, astrology, of, the, middle, ages, sirius, was, a, behenian, fixed, star, associated, with, beryl, and, juniper, its, astrological, symbol, was, listed, by, heinrich, cornelius, agrippa, many, cultures, have, historically, attached, special, significance, to, sirius, particularly, in, relation, to, dogs, it, is, often, colloquially, called, the, dog, star, as, the, brightest, star, of, canis, major, the, great, dog, constellation, canis, major, was, classically, depicted, as, orion, s, dog, the, ancient, greeks, thought, that, sirius, s, emanations, could, affect, dogs, adversely, making, them, behave, abnormally, during, the, dog, days, the, hottest, days, of, the, summer, the, romans, knew, these, days, as, dies, caniculares, and, the, star, sirius, was, called, canicula, little, dog, the, excessive, panting, of, dogs, in, hot, weather, was, thought, to, place, them, at, risk, of, desiccation, and, disease, in, extreme, cases, a, foaming, dog, might, have, rabies, which, could, infect, and, kill, humans, they, had, bitten, homer, in, the, iliad, describes, the, approach, of, achilles, toward, troy, in, these, words, sirius, rises, late, in, the, dark, liquid, sky, on, summer, nights, star, of, stars, orion, s, dog, they, call, it, brightest, of, all, but, an, evil, portent, bringing, heat, and, fevers, to, suffering, humanity, in, a, little, attested, greek, myth, the, star, god, that, personified, sirius, fell, in, love, with, a, fertility, goddess, named, opora, but, he, was, unable, to, have, her, thus, he, began, to, burn, hot, making, humans, suffer, who, prayed, to, the, gods, the, god, of, the, north, wind, boreas, solved, the, problem, by, ordering, his, sons, to, deliver, opora, to, sirius, while, he, cooled, down, the, earth, with, blasts, of, his, own, cold, wind, in, iranian, mythology, especially, in, persian, mythology, and, in, zoroastrianism, the, ancient, religion, of, persia, sirius, appears, as, tishtrya, and, is, revered, as, the, rain, maker, divinity, tishtar, of, new, persian, poetry, beside, passages, in, the, sacred, texts, of, the, avesta, the, avestan, language, tishtrya, followed, by, the, version, tir, in, middle, and, new, persian, is, also, depicted, in, the, persian, epic, shahnameh, of, ferdowsi, because, of, the, concept, of, the, yazatas, powers, which, are, worthy, of, worship, tishtrya, is, a, divinity, of, rain, and, fertility, and, an, antagonist, of, apaosha, the, demon, of, drought, in, this, struggle, tishtrya, is, depicted, as, a, white, horse, in, chinese, astronomy, sirius, is, known, as, the, star, of, the, celestial, wolf, chinese, and, japanese, chinese, romanization, ti, nl, ng, japanese, romanization, tenr, korean, and, romanization, cheonrang, in, the, mansion, of, j, ng, many, nations, among, the, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, also, associated, sirius, with, canines, the, seri, and, tohono, o, odham, of, the, southwest, note, the, star, as, a, dog, that, follows, mountain, sheep, while, the, blackfoot, called, it, dog, face, the, cherokee, paired, sirius, with, antares, as, a, dog, star, guardian, of, either, end, of, the, path, of, souls, the, pawnee, of, nebraska, had, several, associations, the, wolf, skidi, tribe, knew, it, as, the, wolf, star, while, other, branches, knew, it, as, the, coyote, star, further, north, the, alaskan, inuit, of, the, bering, strait, called, it, moon, dog, several, cultures, also, associated, the, star, with, a, bow, and, arrows, the, ancient, chinese, visualized, a, large, bow, and, arrow, across, the, southern, sky, formed, by, the, constellations, of, puppis, and, canis, major, in, this, the, arrow, tip, is, pointed, at, the, wolf, sirius, a, similar, association, is, depicted, at, the, temple, of, hathor, in, dendera, where, the, goddess, satet, has, drawn, her, arrow, at, hathor, sirius, known, as, tir, the, star, was, portrayed, as, the, arrow, itself, in, later, persian, culture, sirius, is, mentioned, in, surah, an, najm, the, star, of, the, qur, an, where, it, is, given, the, name, transliteration, a, i, r, or, ash, shira, the, leader, the, verse, is, that, he, is, the, lord, of, sirius, the, mighty, star, an, najm, 49, ibn, kathir, said, in, his, commentary, that, it, is, the, bright, star, named, mirzam, al, jawza, sirius, which, a, group, of, arabs, used, to, worship, the, alternate, name, aschere, used, by, johann, bayer, is, derived, from, this, in, theosophy, it, is, believed, the, seven, stars, of, the, pleiades, transmit, the, spiritual, energy, of, the, seven, rays, from, the, galactic, logos, to, the, seven, stars, of, the, great, bear, then, to, sirius, from, there, is, it, sent, via, the, sun, to, the, god, of, earth, sanat, kumara, and, finally, through, the, seven, masters, of, the, seven, rays, to, the, human, race, the, midnight, culmination, of, sirius, in, the, northern, hemisphere, coincides, with, the, beginning, of, the, new, year, of, the, gregorian, calendar, during, the, decades, around, the, year, 2000, over, the, years, its, midnight, culmination, moves, slowly, owing, to, the, combination, of, the, star, s, proper, motion, and, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, at, the, time, of, the, introduction, of, the, gregorian, calendar, in, the, year, 1582, its, culmination, occurred, 17, minutes, before, midnight, into, the, new, year, under, the, assumption, of, a, constant, motion, according, to, richard, hinckley, allen, its, midnight, culmination, was, celebrated, at, the, temple, of, demeter, at, eleusis, the, dogon, people, are, an, ethnic, group, in, mali, west, africa, reported, by, some, researchers, to, have, traditional, astronomical, knowledge, about, sirius, that, would, normally, be, considered, impossible, without, the, use, of, telescopes, according, to, marcel, griaule, they, knew, about, the, fifty, year, orbital, period, of, sirius, and, its, companion, prior, to, western, astronomers, doubts, have, been, raised, about, the, validity, of, griaule, and, dieterlein, s, work, in, 1991, anthropologist, walter, van, beek, concluded, about, the, dogon, though, they, do, speak, about, sigu, tolo, they, disagree, completely, with, each, other, as, to, which, star, is, meant, for, some, it, is, an, invisible, star, that, should, rise, to, announce, the, sigu, for, another, it, is, venus, that, through, a, different, position, appears, as, sigu, tolo, all, agree, however, that, they, learned, about, the, star, from, griaule, according, to, noah, brosch, cultural, transfer, of, relatively, modern, astronomical, information, could, have, taken, place, in, 1893, when, a, french, expedition, arrived, in, central, west, africa, to, observe, the, total, eclipse, on, 16, april, in, the, religion, of, the, serer, people, of, senegal, the, gambia, and, mauritania, sirius, is, called, yoonir, from, the, serer, language, and, some, of, the, cangin, language, speakers, who, are, all, ethnically, serers, the, star, sirius, is, one, of, the, most, important, and, sacred, stars, in, serer, religious, cosmology, and, symbolism, the, serer, high, priests, and, priestesses, saltigues, the, hereditary, rain, priests, chart, yoonir, to, forecast, rainfall, and, enable, serer, farmers, to, start, planting, seeds, in, serer, religious, cosmology, it, is, the, symbol, of, the, universe, sirius, features, on, the, coat, of, arms, of, macquarie, university, and, is, the, name, of, its, alumnae, journal, seven, ships, of, the, royal, navy, have, been, called, hms, sirius, since, the, 18th, century, with, the, first, being, the, flagship, of, the, first, fleet, to, australia, in, 1788, the, royal, australian, navy, subsequently, named, a, vessel, hmas, sirius, in, honor, of, the, flagship, american, vessels, include, the, usns, sirius, t, afs, 8, as, well, as, a, monoplane, model, the, lockheed, sirius, the, first, of, which, was, flown, by, charles, lindbergh, the, name, was, also, adopted, by, mitsubishi, motors, as, the, mitsubishi, sirius, engine, in, 1980, the, name, of, the, north, american, satellite, radio, company, cd, radio, was, changed, to, sirius, satellite, radio, in, november, 1999, being, named, after, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, sirius, is, one, of, the, 27, stars, on, the, flag, of, brazil, where, it, represents, the, state, of, mato, grosso, composer, karlheinz, stockhausen, who, wrote, a, piece, called, sirius, is, claimed, to, have, said, on, several, occasions, that, he, came, from, a, planet, in, the, sirius, system, to, stockhausen, sirius, stood, for, the, place, where, music, is, the, highest, of, vibrations, and, where, music, had, been, developed, in, the, most, perfect, way, sirius, has, been, the, subject, of, poetry, dante, and, john, milton, reference, the, star, and, it, is, the, powerful, western, fallen, star, of, walt, whitman, s, when, lilacs, last, in, the, dooryard, bloom, d, while, tennyson, s, poem, the, princess, describes, the, star, s, scintillation, the, fiery, sirius, alters, hue, and, bickers, into, red, and, emerald
