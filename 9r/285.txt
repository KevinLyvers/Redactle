organometallic, chemistry, is, the, study, of, organometallic, compounds, chemical, compounds, containing, at, least, one, chemical, bond, between, a, carbon, atom, of, an, organic, molecule, and, a, metal, including, alkali, alkaline, earth, and, transition, metals, and, sometimes, broadened, to, include, metalloids, like, boron, silicon, and, selenium, as, well, aside, from, bonds, to, organyl, fragments, or, molecules, bonds, to, inorganic, carbon, like, carbon, monoxide, metal, carbonyls, cyanide, or, carbide, are, generally, considered, to, be, organometallic, as, well, some, related, compounds, such, as, transition, metal, hydrides, and, metal, phosphine, complexes, are, often, included, in, discussions, of, organometallic, compounds, though, strictly, speaking, they, are, not, necessarily, organometallic, the, related, but, distinct, term, metalorganic, compound, refers, to, metal, containing, compounds, lacking, direct, metal, carbon, bonds, but, which, contain, organic, ligands, metal, diketonates, alkoxides, dialkylamides, and, metal, phosphine, complexes, are, representative, members, of, this, class, the, field, of, organometallic, chemistry, combines, aspects, of, traditional, inorganic, and, organic, chemistry, organometallic, compounds, are, widely, used, both, stoichiometrically, in, research, and, industrial, chemical, reactions, as, well, as, in, the, role, of, catalysts, to, increase, the, rates, of, such, reactions, e, g, as, in, uses, of, homogeneous, catalysis, where, target, molecules, include, polymers, pharmaceuticals, and, many, other, types, of, practical, products, organometallic, compounds, are, distinguished, by, the, prefix, organo, e, g, organopalladium, compounds, and, include, all, compounds, which, contain, a, bond, between, a, metal, atom, and, a, carbon, atom, of, an, organyl, group, in, addition, to, the, traditional, metals, alkali, metals, alkali, earth, metals, transition, metals, and, post, transition, metals, lanthanides, actinides, semimetals, and, the, elements, boron, silicon, arsenic, and, selenium, are, considered, to, form, organometallic, compounds, examples, of, organometallic, compounds, include, gilman, reagents, which, contain, lithium, and, copper, and, grignard, reagents, which, contain, magnesium, boron, containing, organometallic, compounds, are, often, the, result, of, hydroboration, and, carboboration, reactions, tetracarbonyl, nickel, and, ferrocene, are, examples, of, organometallic, compounds, containing, transition, metals, other, examples, of, organometallic, compounds, include, organolithium, compounds, such, as, n, butyllithium, n, buli, organozinc, compounds, such, as, diethylzinc, et, 2, zn, organotin, compounds, such, as, tributyltin, hydride, bu, 3, snh, organoborane, compounds, such, as, triethylborane, et, 3, b, and, organoaluminium, compounds, such, as, trimethylaluminium, me, 3, al, a, naturally, occurring, organometallic, complex, is, methylcobalamin, a, form, of, vitamin, b, 12, which, contains, a, cobalt, methyl, bond, this, complex, along, with, other, biologically, relevant, complexes, are, often, discussed, within, the, subfield, of, bioorganometallic, chemistry, many, complexes, feature, coordination, bonds, between, a, metal, and, organic, ligands, complexes, where, the, organic, ligands, bind, the, metal, through, a, heteroatom, such, as, oxygen, or, nitrogen, are, considered, coordination, compounds, e, g, heme, a, and, fe, acac, 3, however, if, any, of, the, ligands, form, a, direct, metal, carbon, m, c, bond, then, the, complex, is, considered, to, be, organometallic, although, the, iupac, has, not, formally, defined, the, term, some, chemists, use, the, term, metalorganic, to, describe, any, coordination, compound, containing, an, organic, ligand, regardless, of, the, presence, of, a, direct, m, c, bond, the, status, of, compounds, in, which, the, canonical, anion, has, a, negative, charge, that, is, shared, between, delocalized, a, carbon, atom, and, an, atom, more, electronegative, than, carbon, e, g, enolates, may, vary, with, the, nature, of, the, anionic, moiety, the, metal, ion, and, possibly, the, medium, in, the, absence, of, direct, structural, evidence, for, a, carbon, metal, bond, such, compounds, are, not, considered, to, be, organometallic, for, instance, lithium, enolates, often, contain, only, li, o, bonds, and, are, not, organometallic, while, zinc, enolates, reformatsky, reagents, contain, both, zn, o, and, zn, c, bonds, and, are, organometallic, in, nature, the, metal, carbon, bond, in, organometallic, compounds, is, generally, highly, covalent, for, highly, electropositive, elements, such, as, lithium, and, sodium, the, carbon, ligand, exhibits, carbanionic, character, but, free, carbon, based, anions, are, extremely, rare, an, example, being, cyanide, most, organometallic, compounds, are, solids, at, room, temperature, however, some, are, liquids, such, as, methylcyclopentadienyl, manganese, tricarbonyl, or, even, volatile, liquids, such, as, nickel, tetracarbonyl, many, organometallic, compounds, are, air, sensitive, reactive, towards, oxygen, and, moisture, and, thus, they, must, be, handled, under, an, inert, atmosphere, some, organometallic, compounds, such, as, triethylaluminium, are, pyrophoric, and, will, ignite, on, contact, with, air, as, in, other, areas, of, chemistry, electron, counting, is, useful, for, organizing, organometallic, chemistry, the, 18, electron, rule, is, helpful, in, predicting, the, stabilities, of, organometallic, complexes, for, example, metal, carbonyls, and, metal, hydrides, the, 18e, rule, has, two, representative, electron, counting, models, ionic, and, neutral, also, known, as, covalent, ligand, models, respectively, the, hapticity, of, a, metal, ligand, complex, can, influence, the, electron, count, hapticity, lowercase, greek, eta, describes, the, number, of, contiguous, ligands, coordinated, to, a, metal, for, example, ferrocene, has, two, cyclopentadienyl, ligands, giving, a, hapticity, of, 5, where, all, five, carbon, atoms, of, the, c, 5, h, 5, ligand, bond, equally, and, contribute, one, electron, to, the, iron, center, ligands, that, bind, non, contiguous, atoms, are, denoted, the, greek, letter, kappa, chelating, 2, acetate, is, an, example, the, covalent, bond, classification, method, identifies, three, classes, of, ligands, x, l, and, z, which, are, based, on, the, electron, donating, interactions, of, the, ligand, many, organometallic, compounds, do, not, follow, the, 18e, rule, the, metal, atoms, in, organometallic, compounds, are, frequently, described, by, their, d, electron, count, and, oxidation, state, these, concepts, can, be, used, to, help, predict, their, reactivity, and, preferred, geometry, chemical, bonding, and, reactivity, in, organometallic, compounds, is, often, discussed, from, the, perspective, of, the, isolobal, principle, a, wide, variety, of, physical, techniques, are, used, to, determine, the, structure, composition, and, properties, of, organometallic, compounds, x, ray, diffraction, is, a, particularly, important, technique, that, can, locate, the, positions, of, atoms, within, a, solid, compound, providing, a, detailed, description, of, its, structure, other, techniques, like, infrared, spectroscopy, and, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, are, also, frequently, used, to, obtain, information, on, the, structure, and, bonding, of, organometallic, compounds, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, is, a, common, technique, used, to, obtain, information, on, the, electronic, structure, of, organometallic, compounds, it, is, also, used, monitor, the, progress, of, organometallic, reactions, as, well, as, determine, their, kinetics, the, dynamics, of, organometallic, compounds, can, be, studied, using, dynamic, nmr, spectroscopy, other, notable, techniques, include, x, ray, absorption, spectroscopy, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, and, elemental, analysis, due, to, their, high, reactivity, towards, oxygen, and, moisture, organometallic, compounds, often, must, be, handled, using, air, free, techniques, air, free, handling, of, organometallic, compounds, typically, requires, the, use, of, laboratory, apparatuses, such, as, a, glovebox, or, schlenk, line, early, developments, in, organometallic, chemistry, include, louis, claude, cadet, s, synthesis, of, methyl, arsenic, compounds, related, to, cacodyl, william,
