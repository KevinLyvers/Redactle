enceladus, is, the, sixth, largest, moon, of, saturn, and, the, 19th, largest, in, the, solar, system, it, is, about, 500, kilometers, 310, miles, in, diameter, about, a, tenth, of, that, of, saturn, s, largest, moon, titan, it, is, mostly, covered, by, fresh, clean, ice, making, it, one, of, the, most, reflective, bodies, of, the, solar, system, consequently, its, surface, temperature, at, noon, reaches, only, 198, c, 75, 1, k, 324, 4, f, far, colder, than, a, light, absorbing, body, would, be, despite, its, small, size, enceladus, has, a, wide, variety, of, surface, features, ranging, from, old, heavily, cratered, regions, to, young, tectonically, deformed, terrain, enceladus, was, discovered, on, august, 28, 1789, by, william, herschel, but, little, was, known, about, it, until, the, two, voyager, spacecrafts, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, flew, by, saturn, in, 1980, and, 1981, in, 2005, the, spacecraft, cassini, started, multiple, close, flybys, of, enceladus, revealing, its, surface, and, environment, in, greater, detail, in, particular, cassini, discovered, water, rich, plumes, venting, from, the, south, polar, region, cryovolcanoes, near, the, south, pole, shoot, geyser, like, jets, of, water, vapor, molecular, hydrogen, other, volatiles, and, solid, material, including, sodium, chloride, crystals, and, ice, particles, into, space, totaling, about, 200, kilograms, 440, pounds, per, second, more, than, 100, geysers, have, been, identified, some, of, the, water, vapor, falls, back, as, snow, the, rest, escapes, and, supplies, most, of, the, material, making, up, saturn, s, e, ring, according, to, nasa, scientists, the, plumes, are, similar, in, composition, to, comets, in, 2014, nasa, reported, that, cassini, had, found, evidence, for, a, large, south, polar, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, water, with, a, thickness, of, around, 10, km, 6, mi, the, existence, of, enceladus, subsurface, ocean, has, since, been, mathematically, modelled, and, replicated, these, observations, of, active, cryoeruptions, along, with, the, finding, of, escaping, internal, heat, and, very, few, if, any, impact, craters, in, the, south, polar, region, show, that, enceladus, is, currently, geologically, active, like, many, other, satellites, in, the, extensive, systems, of, the, giant, planets, enceladus, participates, in, an, orbital, resonance, its, resonance, with, dione, excites, its, orbital, eccentricity, which, is, damped, by, tidal, forces, tidally, heating, its, interior, and, driving, the, geological, activity, cassini, performed, chemical, analysis, of, enceladus, s, plumes, finding, evidence, for, hydrothermal, activity, possibly, driving, complex, chemistry, ongoing, research, on, cassini, data, suggests, that, enceladus, s, hydrothermal, environment, could, be, habitable, to, some, of, earth, s, hydrothermal, vent, s, microorganisms, and, that, plume, found, methane, could, be, produced, by, such, organisms, enceladus, was, discovered, by, william, herschel, on, august, 28, 1789, during, the, first, use, of, his, new, 1, 2, m, 47, in, 40, foot, telescope, then, the, largest, in, the, world, at, observatory, house, in, slough, england, its, faint, apparent, magnitude, h, v, 11, 7, and, its, proximity, to, the, much, brighter, saturn, and, saturn, s, rings, make, enceladus, difficult, to, observe, from, earth, with, smaller, telescopes, like, many, satellites, of, saturn, discovered, prior, to, the, space, age, enceladus, was, first, observed, during, a, saturnian, equinox, when, earth, is, within, the, ring, plane, at, such, times, the, reduction, in, glare, from, the, rings, makes, the, moons, easier, to, observe, prior, to, the, voyager, missions, the, view, of, enceladus, improved, little, from, the, dot, first, observed, by, herschel, only, its, orbital, characteristics, were, known, with, estimations, of, its, mass, density, and, albedo, enceladus, is, named, after, the, giant, enceladus, of, greek, mythology, the, name, like, the, names, of, each, of, the, first, seven, satellites, of, saturn, to, be, discovered, was, suggested, by, william, herschel, s, son, john, herschel, in, his, 1847, publication, results, of, astronomical, observations, made, at, the, cape, of, good, hope, he, chose, these, names, because, saturn, known, in, greek, mythology, as, cronus, was, the, leader, of, the, titans, geological, features, on, enceladus, are, named, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, after, characters, and, places, from, richard, francis, burton, s, 1885, translation, of, the, book, of, one, thousand, and, one, nights, impact, craters, are, named, after, characters, whereas, other, feature, types, such, as, fossae, long, narrow, depressions, dorsa, ridges, planitiae, plains, sulci, long, parallel, grooves, and, rupes, cliffs, are, named, after, places, the, iau, has, officially, named, 85, features, on, enceladus, most, recently, samaria, rupes, formerly, called, samaria, fossa, enceladus, is, a, relatively, small, satellite, composed, of, ice, and, rock, it, is, a, scalene, ellipsoid, in, shape, its, diameters, calculated, from, images, taken, by, cassini, s, iss, imaging, science, subsystem, instrument, are, 513, km, between, the, sub, and, anti, saturnian, poles, 503, km, between, the, leading, and, trailing, hemispheres, and, 497, km, between, the, north, and, south, poles, enceladus, is, only, one, seventh, the, diameter, of, earth, s, moon, it, ranks, sixth, in, both, mass, and, size, among, the, satellites, of, saturn, after, titan, 5, 150, km, rhea, 1, 530, km, iapetus, 1, 440, km, dione, 1, 120, km, and, tethys, 1, 050, km, enceladus, is, one, of, the, major, inner, satellites, of, saturn, along, with, dione, tethys, and, mimas, it, orbits, at, 238, 000, km, 148, 000, mi, from, saturn, s, center, and, 180, 000, km, 110, 000, mi, from, its, cloud, tops, between, the, orbits, of, mimas, and, tethys, it, orbits, saturn, every, 32, 9, hours, fast, enough, for, its, motion, to, be, observed, over, a, single, night, of, observation, enceladus, is, currently, in, a, 2, 1, mean, motion, orbital, resonance, with, dione, completing, two, orbits, around, saturn, for, every, one, orbit, completed, by, dione, this, resonance, maintains, enceladus, s, orbital, eccentricity, 0, 0047, which, is, known, as, a, forced, eccentricity, this, non, zero, eccentricity, results, in, tidal, deformation, of, enceladus, the, dissipated, heat, resulting, from, this, deformation, is, the, main, heating, source, for, enceladus, s, geologic, activity, enceladus, orbits, within, the, densest, part, of, saturn, s, e, ring, the, outermost, of, its, major, rings, and, is, the, main, source, of, the, ring, s, material, composition, like, most, of, saturn, s, larger, satellites, enceladus, rotates, synchronously, with, its, orbital, period, keeping, one, face, pointed, toward, saturn, unlike, earth, s, moon, enceladus, does, not, appear, to, librate, more, than, 1, 5, about, its, spin, axis, however, analysis, of, the, shape, of, enceladus, suggests, that, at, some, point, it, was, in, a, 1, 4, forced, secondary, spin, orbit, libration, this, libration, could, have, provided, enceladus, with, an, additional, heat, source, plumes, from, enceladus, which, are, similar, in, composition, to, comets, have, been, shown, to, be, the, source, of, the, material, in, saturn, s, e, ring, the, e, ring, is, the, widest, and, outermost, ring, of, saturn, except, for, the, tenuous, phoebe, ring, it, is, an, extremely, wide, but, diffuse, disk, of, microscopic, icy, or, dusty, material, distributed, between, the, orbits, of, mimas, and, titan, mathematical, models, show, that, the, e, ring, is, unstable, with, a, lifespan, between, 10, 000, and, 1, 000, 000, years, therefore, particles, composing, it, must, be, constantly, replenished, enceladus, is, orbiting, inside, the, ring, at, its, narrowest, but, highest, density, point, in, the, 1980s, some, suspected, that, enceladus, is, the, main, source, of, particles, for, the, ring, this, hypothesis, was, confirmed, by, cassini, s, first, two, close, flybys, in, 2005, the, cosmic, dust, analyzer, cda, detected, a, large, increase, in, the, number, of, particles, near, enceladus, confirming, it, as, the, primary, source, for, the, e, ring, analysis, of, the, cda, and, inms, data, suggest, that, the, gas, cloud, cassini, flew, through, during, the, july, encounter, and, observed, from, a, distance, with, its, magnetometer, and, uvis, was, actually, a, water, rich, cryovolcanic, plume, originating, from, vents, near, the, south, pole, visual, confirmation, of, venting, came, in, november, 2005, when, cassini, imaged, geyser, like, jets, of, icy, particles, rising, from, enceladus, s, south, polar, region, although, the, plume, was, imaged, before, in, january, and, february, 2005, additional, studies, of, the, camera, s, response, at, high, phase, angles, when, the, sun, is, almost, behind, enceladus, and, comparison, with, equivalent, high, phase, angle, images, taken, of, other, saturnian, satellites, were, required, before, this, could, be, confirmed, voyager, 2, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, observe, enceladus, s, surface, in, detail, in, august, 1981, examination, of, the, resulting, highest, resolution, imagery, revealed, at, least, five, different, types, of, terrain, including, several, regions, of, cratered, terrain, regions, of, smooth, young, terrain, and, lanes, of, ridged, terrain, often, bordering, the, smooth, areas, extensive, linear, cracks, and, scarps, were, observed, given, the, relative, lack, of, craters, on, the, smooth, plains, these, regions, are, probably, less, than, a, few, hundred, million, years, old, accordingly, enceladus, must, have, been, recently, active, with, water, volcanism, or, other, processes, that, renew, the, surface, the, fresh, clean, ice, that, dominates, its, surface, makes, enceladus, the, most, reflective, body, in, the, solar, system, with, a, visual, geometric, albedo, of, 1, 38, and, bolometric, bond, albedo, of, 0, 81, 0, 04, because, it, reflects, so, much, sunlight, its, surface, only, reaches, a, mean, noon, temperature, of, 198, c, 324, f, somewhat, colder, than, other, saturnian, satellites, observations, during, three, flybys, on, february, 17, march, 9, and, july, 14, 2005, revealed, enceladus, s, surface, features, in, much, greater, detail, than, the, voyager, 2, observations, the, smooth, plains, which, voyager, 2, had, observed, resolved, into, relatively, crater, free, regions, filled, with, numerous, small, ridges, and, scarps, numerous, fractures, were, found, within, the, older, cratered, terrain, suggesting, that, the, surface, has, been, subjected, to, extensive, deformation, since, the, craters, were, formed, some, areas, contain, no, craters, indicating, major, resurfacing, events, in, the, geologically, recent, past, there, are, fissures, plains, corrugated, terrain, and, other, crustal, deformations, several, additional, regions, of, young, terrain, were, discovered, in, areas, not, well, imaged, by, either, voyager, spacecraft, such, as, the, bizarre, terrain, near, the, south, pole, all, of, this, indicates, that, enceladus, s, interior, is, liquid, today, even, though, it, should, have, been, frozen, long, ago, impact, cratering, is, a, common, occurrence, on, many, solar, system, bodies, much, of, enceladus, s, surface, is, covered, with, craters, at, various, densities, and, levels, of, degradation, this, subdivision, of, cratered, terrains, on, the, basis, of, crater, density, and, thus, surface, age, suggests, that, enceladus, has, been, resurfaced, in, multiple, stages, cassini, observations, provided, a, much, closer, look, at, the, crater, distribution, and, size, showing, that, many, of, enceladus, s, craters, are, heavily, degraded, through, viscous, relaxation, and, fracturing, viscous, relaxation, allows, gravity, over, geologic, time, scales, to, deform, craters, and, other, topographic, features, formed, in, water, ice, reducing, the, amount, of, topography, over, time, the, rate, at, which, this, occurs, is, dependent, on, the, temperature, of, the, ice, warmer, ice, is, easier, to, deform, than, colder, stiffer, ice, viscously, relaxed, craters, tend, to, have, domed, floors, or, are, recognized, as, craters, only, by, a, raised, circular, rim, dunyazad, crater, is, a, prime, example, of, a, viscously, relaxed, crater, on, enceladus, with, a, prominent, domed, floor, voyager, 2, found, several, types, of, tectonic, features, on, enceladus, including, troughs, scarps, and, belts, of, grooves, and, ridges, results, from, cassini, suggest, that, tectonics, is, the, dominant, mode, of, deformation, on, enceladus, including, rifts, one, of, the, more, dramatic, types, of, tectonic, features, that, were, noted, these, canyons, can, be, up, to, 200, km, long, 5, 10, km, wide, and, 1, km, deep, such, features, are, geologically, young, because, they, cut, across, other, tectonic, features, and, have, sharp, topographic, relief, with, prominent, outcrops, along, the, cliff, faces, evidence, of, tectonics, on, enceladus, is, also, derived, from, grooved, terrain, consisting, of, lanes, of, curvilinear, grooves, and, ridges, these, bands, first, discovered, by, voyager, 2, often, separate, smooth, plains, from, cratered, regions, grooved, terrains, such, as, the, samarkand, sulci, are, reminiscent, of, grooved, terrain, on, ganymede, unlike, those, seen, on, ganymede, grooved, topography, on, enceladus, is, generally, more, complex, rather, than, parallel, sets, of, grooves, these, lanes, often, appear, as, bands, of, crudely, aligned, chevron, shaped, features, in, other, areas, these, bands, bow, upwards, with, fractures, and, ridges, running, the, length, of, the, feature, cassini, observations, of, the, samarkand, sulci, have, revealed, dark, spots, 125, and, 750, m, wide, located, parallel, to, the, narrow, fractures, currently, these, spots, are, interpreted, as, collapse, pits, within, these, ridged, plain, belts, in, addition, to, deep, fractures, and, grooved, lanes, enceladus, has, several, other, types, of, tectonic, terrain, many, of, these, fractures, are, found, in, bands, cutting, across, cratered, terrain, these, fractures, probably, propagate, down, only, a, few, hundred, meters, into, the, crust, many, have, probably, been, influenced, during, their, formation, by, the, weakened, regolith, produced, by, impact, craters, often, changing, the, strike, of, the, propagating, fracture, another, example, of, tectonic, features, on, enceladus, are, the, linear, grooves, first, found, by, voyager, 2, and, seen, at, a, much, higher, resolution, by, cassini, these, linear, grooves, can, be, seen, cutting, across, other, terrain, types, like, the, groove, and, ridge, belts, like, the, deep, rifts, they, are, among, the, youngest, features, on, enceladus, however, some, linear, grooves, have, been, softened, like, the, craters, nearby, suggesting, that, they, are, older, ridges, have, also, been, observed, on, enceladus, though, not, nearly, to, the, extent, as, those, seen, on, europa, these, ridges, are, relatively, limited, in, extent, and, are, up, to, one, kilometer, tall, one, kilometer, high, domes, have, also, been, observed, given, the, level, of, resurfacing, found, on, enceladus, it, is, clear, that, tectonic, movement, has, been, an, important, driver, of, geology, for, much, of, its, history, two, regions, of, smooth, plains, were, observed, by, voyager, 2, they, generally, have, low, relief, and, have, far, fewer, craters, than, in, the, cratered, terrains, indicating, a, relatively, young, surface, age, in, one, of, the, smooth, plain, regions, sarandib, planitia, no, impact, craters, were, visible, down, to, the, limit, of, resolution, another, region, of, smooth, plains, to, the, southwest, of, sarandib, is, criss, crossed, by, several, troughs, and, scarps, cassini, has, since, viewed, these, smooth, plains, regions, like, sarandib, planitia, and, diyar, planitia, at, much, higher, resolution, cassini, images, show, these, regions, filled, with, low, relief, ridges, and, fractures, probably, caused, by, shear, deformation, the, high, resolution, images, of, sarandib, planitia, revealed, a, number, of, small, impact, craters, which, allow, for, an, estimate, of, the, surface, age, either, 170, million, years, or, 3, 7, billion, years, depending, on, assumed, impactor, population, the, expanded, surface, coverage, provided, by, cassini, has, allowed, for, the, identification, of, additional, regions, of, smooth, plains, particularly, on, enceladus, s, leading, hemisphere, the, side, of, enceladus, that, faces, the, direction, of, motion, as, it, orbits, saturn, rather, than, being, covered, in, low, relief, ridges, this, region, is, covered, in, numerous, criss, crossing, sets, of, troughs, and, ridges, similar, to, the, deformation, seen, in, the, south, polar, region, this, area, is, on, the, opposite, side, of, enceladus, from, sarandib, and, diyar, planitiae, suggesting, that, the, placement, of, these, regions, is, influenced, by, saturn, s, tides, on, enceladus, images, taken, by, cassini, during, the, flyby, on, july, 14, 2005, revealed, a, distinctive, tectonically, deformed, region, surrounding, enceladus, s, south, pole, this, area, reaching, as, far, north, as, 60, south, latitude, is, covered, in, tectonic, fractures, and, ridges, the, area, has, few, sizable, impact, craters, suggesting, that, it, is, the, youngest, surface, on, enceladus, and, on, any, of, the, mid, sized, icy, satellites, modeling, of, the, cratering, rate, suggests, that, some, regions, of, the, south, polar, terrain, are, possibly, as, young, as, 500, 000, years, or, less, near, the, center, of, this, terrain, are, four, fractures, bounded, by, ridges, unofficially, called, tiger, stripes, they, appear, to, be, the, youngest, features, in, this, region, and, are, surrounded, by, mint, green, colored, in, false, color, uv, green, near, ir, images, coarse, grained, water, ice, seen, elsewhere, on, the, surface, within, outcrops, and, fracture, walls, here, the, blue, ice, is, on, a, flat, surface, indicating, that, the, region, is, young, enough, not, to, have, been, coated, by, fine, grained, water, ice, from, the, e, ring, results, from, the, visual, and, infrared, mapping, spectrometer, vims, instrument, suggest, that, the, green, colored, material, surrounding, the, tiger, stripes, is, chemically, distinct, from, the, rest, of, the, surface, of, enceladus, vims, detected, crystalline, water, ice, in, the, stripes, suggesting, that, they, are, quite, young, likely, less, than, 1, 000, years, old, or, the, surface, ice, has, been, thermally, altered, in, the, recent, past, vims, also, detected, simple, organic, carbon, containing, compounds, in, the, tiger, stripes, chemistry, not, found, anywhere, else, on, enceladus, thus, far, one, of, these, areas, of, blue, ice, in, the, south, polar, region, was, observed, at, high, resolution, during, the, july, 14, 2005, flyby, revealing, an, area, of, extreme, tectonic, deformation, and, blocky, terrain, with, some, areas, covered, in, boulders, 10, 100, m, across, the, boundary, of, the, south, polar, region, is, marked, by, a, pattern, of, parallel, y, and, v, shaped, ridges, and, valleys, the, shape, orientation, and, location, of, these, features, suggest, they, are, caused, by, changes, in, the, overall, shape, of, enceladus, as, of, 2006, there, were, two, theories, for, what, could, cause, such, a, shift, in, shape, the, orbit, of, enceladus, may, have, migrated, inward, leading, to, an, increase, in, enceladus, s, rotation, rate, such, a, shift, would, lead, to, a, more, oblate, shape, or, a, rising, mass, of, warm, low, density, material, in, enceladus, s, interior, may, have, led, to, a, shift, in, the, position, of, the, current, south, polar, terrain, from, enceladus, s, southern, mid, latitudes, to, its, south, pole, consequently, the, moon, s, ellipsoid, shape, would, have, adjusted, to, match, the, new, orientation, one, problem, of, the, polar, flattening, hypothesis, is, that, both, polar, regions, should, have, similar, tectonic, deformation, histories, however, the, north, polar, region, is, densely, cratered, and, has, a, much, older, surface, age, than, the, south, pole, thickness, variations, in, enceladus, s, lithosphere, is, one, explanation, for, this, discrepancy, variations, in, lithospheric, thickness, are, supported, by, the, correlation, between, the, y, shaped, discontinuities, and, the, v, shaped, cusps, along, the, south, polar, terrain, margin, and, the, relative, surface, age, of, the, adjacent, non, south, polar, terrain, regions, the, y, shaped, discontinuities, and, the, north, south, trending, tension, fractures, into, which, they, lead, are, correlated, with, younger, terrain, with, presumably, thinner, lithospheres, the, v, shaped, cusps, are, adjacent, to, older, more, heavily, cratered, terrains, following, voyager, s, encounters, with, enceladus, in, the, early, 1980s, scientists, postulated, it, to, be, geologically, active, based, on, its, young, reflective, surface, and, location, near, the, core, of, the, e, ring, based, on, the, connection, between, enceladus, and, the, e, ring, scientists, suspected, that, enceladus, was, the, source, of, material, in, the, e, ring, perhaps, through, venting, of, water, vapor, the, first, cassini, sighting, of, a, plume, of, icy, particles, above, enceladus, s, south, pole, came, from, the, imaging, science, subsystem, iss, images, taken, in, january, and, february, 2005, though, the, possibility, of, a, camera, artifact, delayed, an, official, announcement, data, from, the, magnetometer, instrument, during, the, february, 17, 2005, encounter, provided, evidence, for, a, planetary, atmosphere, the, magnetometer, observed, a, deflection, or, draping, of, the, magnetic, field, consistent, with, local, ionization, of, neutral, gas, during, the, two, following, encounters, the, magnetometer, team, determined, that, gases, in, enceladus, s, atmosphere, are, concentrated, over, the, south, polar, region, with, atmospheric, density, away, from, the, pole, being, much, lower, unlike, the, magnetometer, the, ultraviolet, imaging, spectrograph, failed, to, detect, an, atmosphere, above, enceladus, during, the, february, encounter, when, it, looked, over, the, equatorial, region, but, did, detect, water, vapor, during, an, occultation, over, the, south, polar, region, during, the, july, encounter, cassini, flew, through, this, gas, cloud, on, a, few, encounters, allowing, instruments, such, as, the, ion, and, neutral, mass, spectrometer, inms, and, the, cosmic, dust, analyzer, cda, to, directly, sample, the, plume, see, composition, section, the, november, 2005, images, showed, the, plume, s, fine, structure, revealing, numerous, jets, perhaps, issuing, from, numerous, distinct, vents, within, a, larger, faint, component, extending, out, nearly, 500, km, 310, mi, from, the, surface, the, particles, have, a, bulk, velocity, of, 1, 25, 0, 1, kilometers, per, second, 2, 800, 220, miles, per, hour, and, a, maximum, velocity, of, 3, 40, km, s, 7, 600, mph, cassini, s, uvis, later, observed, gas, jets, coinciding, with, the, dust, jets, seen, by, iss, during, a, non, targeted, encounter, with, enceladus, in, october, 2007, the, combined, analysis, of, imaging, mass, spectrometry, and, magnetospheric, data, suggests, that, the, observed, south, polar, plume, emanates, from, pressurized, subsurface, chambers, similar, to, earth, s, geysers, or, fumaroles, fumaroles, are, probably, the, closer, analogy, since, periodic, or, episodic, emission, is, an, inherent, property, of, geysers, the, plumes, of, enceladus, were, observed, to, be, continuous, to, within, a, factor, of, a, few, the, mechanism, that, drives, and, sustains, the, eruptions, is, thought, to, be, tidal, heating, the, intensity, of, the, eruption, of, the, south, polar, jets, varies, significantly, as, a, function, of, the, position, of, enceladus, in, its, orbit, the, plumes, are, about, four, times, brighter, when, enceladus, is, at, apoapsis, the, point, in, its, orbit, most, distant, from, saturn, than, when, it, is, at, periapsis, this, is, consistent, with, geophysical, calculations, which, predict, the, south, polar, fissures, are, under, compression, near, periapsis, pushing, them, shut, and, under, tension, near, apoapsis, pulling, them, open, strike, slip, tectonics, may, also, drive, localized, extension, along, alternating, left, and, right, lateral, transtensional, zones, e, g, pull, apart, basins, over, the, tiger, stripes, thereby, regulating, jet, activity, within, these, regions, much, of, the, plume, activity, consists, of, broad, curtain, like, eruptions, optical, illusions, from, a, combination, of, viewing, direction, and, local, fracture, geometry, previously, made, the, plumes, look, like, discrete, jets, the, extent, to, which, cryovolcanism, really, occurs, is, a, subject, of, some, debate, at, enceladus, it, appears, that, cryovolcanism, occurs, because, water, filled, cracks, are, periodically, exposed, to, vacuum, the, cracks, being, opened, and, closed, by, tidal, stresses, before, the, cassini, mission, little, was, known, about, the, interior, of, enceladus, however, flybys, by, cassini, provided, information, for, models, of, enceladus, s, interior, including, a, better, determination, of, the, mass, and, shape, high, resolution, observations, of, the, surface, and, new, insights, on, the, interior, initial, mass, estimates, from, the, voyager, program, missions, suggested, that, enceladus, was, composed, almost, entirely, of, water, ice, however, based, on, the, effects, of, enceladus, s, gravity, on, cassini, its, mass, was, determined, to, be, much, higher, than, previously, thought, yielding, a, density, of, 1, 61, g, cm, 3, this, density, is, higher, than, those, of, saturn, s, other, mid, sized, icy, satellites, indicating, that, enceladus, contains, a, greater, percentage, of, silicates, and, iron, castillo, matson, et, al, 2005, suggested, that, iapetus, and, the, other, icy, satellites, of, saturn, formed, relatively, quickly, after, the, formation, of, the, saturnian, subnebula, and, thus, were, rich, in, short, lived, radionuclides, these, radionuclides, like, aluminium, 26, and, iron, 60, have, short, half, lives, and, would, produce, interior, heating, relatively, quickly, without, the, short, lived, variety, enceladus, s, complement, of, long, lived, radionuclides, would, not, have, been, enough, to, prevent, rapid, freezing, of, the, interior, even, with, enceladus, s, comparatively, high, rock, mass, fraction, given, its, small, size, given, enceladus, s, relatively, high, rock, mass, fraction, the, proposed, enhancement, in, 26, al, and, 60, fe, would, result, in, a, differentiated, body, with, an, icy, mantle, and, a, rocky, core, subsequent, radioactive, and, tidal, heating, would, raise, the, temperature, of, the, core, to, 1, 000, k, enough, to, melt, the, inner, mantle, for, enceladus, to, still, be, active, part, of, the, core, must, have, also, melted, forming, magma, chambers, that, would, flex, under, the, strain, of, saturn, s, tides, tidal, heating, such, as, from, the, resonance, with, dione, or, from, libration, would, then, have, sustained, these, hot, spots, in, the, core, and, would, power, the, current, geological, activity, in, addition, to, its, mass, and, modeled, geochemistry, researchers, have, also, examined, enceladus, s, shape, to, determine, if, it, is, differentiated, porco, helfenstein, et, al, 2006, used, limb, measurements, to, determine, that, its, shape, assuming, hydrostatic, equilibrium, is, consistent, with, an, undifferentiated, interior, in, contradiction, to, the, geological, and, geochemical, evidence, however, the, current, shape, also, supports, the, possibility, that, enceladus, is, not, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, and, may, have, rotated, faster, at, some, point, in, the, recent, past, with, a, differentiated, interior, gravity, measurements, by, cassini, show, that, the, density, of, the, core, is, low, indicating, that, the, core, contains, water, in, addition, to, silicates, evidence, of, liquid, water, on, enceladus, began, to, accumulate, in, 2005, when, scientists, observed, plumes, containing, water, vapor, spewing, from, its, south, polar, surface, with, jets, moving, 250, kg, of, water, vapor, every, second, at, up, to, 2, 189, km, h, 1, 360, mph, into, space, soon, after, in, 2006, it, was, determined, that, enceladus, s, plumes, are, the, source, of, saturn, s, e, ring, the, sources, of, salty, particles, are, uniformly, distributed, along, the, tiger, stripes, whereas, sources, of, fresh, particles, are, closely, related, to, the, high, speed, gas, jets, the, salty, particles, are, heavier, and, mostly, fall, back, to, the, surface, whereas, the, fast, fresh, particles, escape, to, the, e, ring, explaining, its, salt, poor, composition, of, 0, 5, 2, of, sodium, salts, by, mass, gravimetric, data, from, cassini, s, december, 2010, flybys, showed, that, enceladus, likely, has, a, liquid, water, ocean, beneath, its, frozen, surface, but, at, the, time, it, was, thought, the, subsurface, ocean, was, limited, to, the, south, pole, the, top, of, the, ocean, probably, lies, beneath, a, 30, to, 40, kilometers, 19, to, 25, mi, thick, ice, shelf, the, ocean, may, be, 10, kilometers, 6, 2, mi, deep, at, the, south, pole, measurements, of, enceladus, s, wobble, as, it, orbits, saturn, called, libration, suggests, that, the, entire, icy, crust, is, detached, from, the, rocky, core, and, therefore, that, a, global, ocean, is, present, beneath, the, surface, the, amount, of, libration, 0, 120, 0, 014, implies, that, this, global, ocean, is, about, 26, to, 31, kilometers, 16, to, 19, miles, deep, for, comparison, earth, s, ocean, has, an, average, depth, of, 3, 7, kilometers, the, cassini, spacecraft, flew, through, the, southern, plumes, on, several, occasions, to, sample, and, analyze, its, composition, as, of, 2019, the, data, gathered, is, still, being, analyzed, and, interpreted, the, plumes, salty, composition, na, cl, co, 3, indicates, that, the, source, is, a, salty, subsurface, ocean, the, inms, instrument, detected, mostly, water, vapor, as, well, as, traces, of, molecular, nitrogen, carbon, dioxide, and, trace, amounts, of, simple, hydrocarbons, such, as, methane, propane, acetylene, and, formaldehyde, the, plumes, composition, as, measured, by, the, inms, is, similar, to, that, seen, at, most, comets, cassini, also, found, traces, of, simple, organic, compounds, in, some, dust, grains, as, well, as, larger, organics, such, as, benzene, c, 6, h, 6, and, complex, macromolecular, organics, as, large, as, 200, atomic, mass, units, and, at, least, 15, carbon, atoms, in, size, the, mass, spectrometer, detected, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, which, was, in, thermodynamic, disequilibrium, with, the, other, components, and, found, traces, of, ammonia, nh, 3, a, model, suggests, that, enceladus, s, salty, ocean, na, cl, co, 3, has, an, alkaline, ph, of, 11, to, 12, the, high, ph, is, interpreted, to, be, a, consequence, of, serpentinization, of, chondritic, rock, that, leads, to, the, generation, of, h, 2, a, geochemical, source, of, energy, that, could, support, both, abiotic, and, biological, synthesis, of, organic, molecules, such, as, those, that, have, been, detected, in, enceladus, s, plumes, further, analysis, in, 2019, was, done, of, the, spectral, characteristics, of, ice, grains, in, enceladus, s, erupting, plumes, the, study, found, that, nitrogen, bearing, and, oxygen, bearing, amines, were, likely, present, with, significant, implications, for, the, availability, of, amino, acids, in, the, internal, ocean, the, researchers, suggested, that, the, compounds, on, enceladus, could, be, precursors, for, biologically, relevant, organic, compounds, during, the, flyby, of, july, 14, 2005, the, composite, infrared, spectrometer, cirs, found, a, warm, region, near, the, south, pole, temperatures, in, this, region, ranged, from, 85, to, 90, k, with, small, areas, showing, as, high, as, 157, k, 116, c, much, too, warm, to, be, explained, by, solar, heating, indicating, that, parts, of, the, south, polar, region, are, heated, from, the, interior, of, enceladus, the, presence, of, a, subsurface, ocean, under, the, south, polar, region, is, now, accepted, but, it, cannot, explain, the, source, of, the, heat, with, an, estimated, heat, flux, of, 200, mw, m, 2, which, is, about, 10, times, higher, than, that, from, radiogenic, heating, alone, several, explanations, for, the, observed, elevated, temperatures, and, the, resulting, plumes, have, been, proposed, including, venting, from, a, subsurface, reservoir, of, liquid, water, sublimation, of, ice, decompression, and, dissociation, of, clathrates, and, shear, heating, but, a, complete, explanation, of, all, the, heat, sources, causing, the, observed, thermal, power, output, of, enceladus, has, not, yet, been, settled, heating, in, enceladus, has, occurred, through, various, mechanisms, ever, since, its, formation, radioactive, decay, in, its, core, may, have, initially, heated, it, giving, it, a, warm, core, and, a, subsurface, ocean, which, is, now, kept, above, freezing, through, unidentified, mechanisms, geophysical, models, indicate, that, tidal, heating, is, a, main, heat, source, perhaps, aided, by, radioactive, decay, and, some, heat, producing, chemical, reactions, a, 2007, study, predicted, the, internal, heat, of, enceladus, if, generated, by, tidal, forces, could, be, no, greater, than, 1, 1, gigawatts, but, data, from, cassini, s, infrared, spectrometer, of, the, south, polar, terrain, over, 16, months, indicate, that, the, internal, heat, generated, power, is, about, 4, 7, gigawatts, and, suggest, that, it, is, in, thermal, equilibrium, the, observed, power, output, of, 4, 7, gigawatts, is, challenging, to, explain, from, tidal, heating, alone, so, the, main, source, of, heat, remains, a, mystery, most, scientists, think, the, observed, heat, flux, of, enceladus, is, not, enough, to, maintain, the, subsurface, ocean, and, therefore, any, subsurface, ocean, must, be, a, remnant, of, a, period, of, higher, eccentricity, and, tidal, heating, or, the, heat, is, produced, through, another, mechanism, tidal, heating, occurs, through, the, tidal, friction, processes, orbital, and, rotational, energy, are, dissipated, as, heat, in, the, crust, of, an, object, in, addition, to, the, extent, that, tides, produce, heat, along, fractures, libration, may, affect, the, magnitude, and, distribution, of, such, tidal, shear, heating, tidal, dissipation, of, enceladus, s, ice, crust, is, significant, because, enceladus, has, a, subsurface, ocean, a, computer, simulation, that, used, data, from, cassini, was, published, in, november, 2017, and, it, indicates, that, friction, heat, from, the, sliding, rock, fragments, within, the, permeable, and, fragmented, core, of, enceladus, could, keep, its, underground, ocean, warm, for, up, to, billions, of, years, it, is, thought, that, if, enceladus, had, a, more, eccentric, orbit, in, the, past, the, enhanced, tidal, forces, could, be, sufficient, to, maintain, a, subsurface, ocean, such, that, a, periodic, enhancement, in, eccentricity, could, maintain, a, subsurface, ocean, that, periodically, changes, in, size, a, 2016, analysis, claimed, that, a, model, of, the, tiger, stripes, as, tidally, flexed, slots, that, puncture, the, ice, shell, can, simultaneously, explain, the, persistence, of, the, eruptions, through, the, tidal, cycle, the, phase, lag, and, the, total, power, output, of, the, tiger, stripe, terrain, while, suggesting, that, eruptions, are, maintained, over, geological, timescales, previous, models, suggest, that, resonant, perturbations, of, dione, could, provide, the, necessary, periodic, eccentricity, changes, to, maintain, the, subsurface, ocean, of, enceladus, if, the, ocean, contains, a, substantial, amount, of, ammonia, the, surface, of, enceladus, indicates, that, the, entire, moon, has, experienced, periods, of, enhanced, heat, flux, in, the, past, the, hot, start, model, of, heating, suggests, enceladus, began, as, ice, and, rock, that, contained, rapidly, decaying, short, lived, radioactive, isotopes, of, aluminium, iron, and, manganese, enormous, amounts, of, heat, were, then, produced, as, these, isotopes, decayed, for, about, 7, million, years, resulting, in, the, consolidation, of, rocky, material, at, the, core, surrounded, by, a, shell, of, ice, although, the, heat, from, radioactivity, would, decrease, over, time, the, combination, of, radioactivity, and, tidal, forces, from, saturn, s, gravitational, tug, could, prevent, the, subsurface, ocean, from, freezing, the, present, day, radiogenic, heating, rate, is, 3, 2, 10, 15, ergs, s, or, 0, 32, gigawatts, assuming, enceladus, has, a, composition, of, ice, iron, and, silicate, materials, heating, from, long, lived, radioactive, isotopes, uranium, 238, uranium, 235, thorium, 232, and, potassium, 40, inside, enceladus, would, add, 0, 3, gigawatts, to, the, observed, heat, flux, the, presence, of, enceladus, s, regionally, thick, subsurface, ocean, suggests, a, heat, flux, 10, times, higher, than, that, from, radiogenic, heating, in, the, silicate, core, because, no, ammonia, was, initially, found, in, the, vented, material, by, inms, or, uvis, which, could, act, as, an, antifreeze, it, was, thought, such, a, heated, pressurized, chamber, would, consist, of, nearly, pure, liquid, water, with, a, temperature, of, at, least, 270, k, 3, c, because, pure, water, requires, more, energy, to, melt, in, july, 2009, it, was, announced, that, traces, of, ammonia, had, been, found, in, the, plumes, during, flybys, in, july, and, october, 2008, reducing, the, freezing, point, of, water, with, ammonia, would, also, allow, for, outgassing, and, higher, gas, pressure, and, less, heat, required, to, power, the, water, plumes, the, subsurface, layer, heating, the, surface, water, ice, could, be, an, ammonia, water, slurry, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 170, k, 103, c, and, thus, less, energy, is, required, to, produce, the, plume, activity, however, the, observed, 4, 7, gigawatts, heat, flux, is, enough, to, power, the, cryovolcanism, without, the, presence, of, ammonia, mimas, the, innermost, of, the, round, moons, of, saturn, and, directly, interior, to, enceladus, is, a, geologically, dead, body, even, though, it, should, experience, stronger, tidal, forces, than, enceladus, this, apparent, paradox, can, be, explained, in, part, by, temperature, dependent, properties, of, water, ice, the, main, constituent, of, the, interiors, of, mimas, and, enceladus, the, tidal, heating, per, unit, mass, is, given, by, the, formula, where, is, the, mass, density, of, the, satellite, n, is, its, mean, orbital, motion, r, is, the, satellite, s, radius, e, is, the, orbital, eccentricity, of, the, satellite, is, the, shear, modulus, and, q, is, the, dimensionless, dissipation, factor, for, a, same, temperature, approximation, the, expected, value, of, q, tid, for, mimas, is, about, 40, times, that, of, enceladus, however, the, material, parameters, and, q, are, temperature, dependent, at, high, temperatures, close, to, the, melting, point, and, q, are, low, so, tidal, heating, is, high, modeling, suggests, that, for, enceladus, both, a, basic, low, energy, thermal, state, with, little, internal, temperature, gradient, and, an, excited, high, energy, thermal, state, with, a, significant, temperature, gradient, and, consequent, convection, endogenic, geologic, activity, once, established, would, be, stable, for, mimas, only, a, low, energy, state, is, expected, to, be, stable, despite, its, being, closer, to, saturn, so, the, model, predicts, a, low, internal, temperature, state, for, mimas, values, of, and, q, are, high, but, a, possible, higher, temperature, state, for, enceladus, values, of, and, q, are, low, additional, historical, information, is, needed, to, explain, how, enceladus, first, entered, the, high, energy, state, e, g, more, radiogenic, heating, or, a, more, eccentric, orbit, in, the, past, the, significantly, higher, density, of, enceladus, relative, to, mimas, 1, 61, vs, 1, 15, g, cm, 3, implying, a, larger, content, of, rock, and, more, radiogenic, heating, in, its, early, history, has, also, been, cited, as, an, important, factor, in, resolving, the, mimas, paradox, it, has, been, suggested, that, for, an, icy, satellite, the, size, of, mimas, or, enceladus, to, enter, an, excited, state, of, tidal, heating, and, convection, it, would, need, to, enter, an, orbital, resonance, before, it, lost, too, much, of, its, primordial, internal, heat, because, mimas, being, smaller, would, cool, more, rapidly, than, enceladus, its, window, of, opportunity, for, initiating, orbital, resonance, driven, convection, would, have, been, considerably, shorter, enceladus, is, losing, mass, at, a, rate, of, 200, kg, second, if, mass, loss, at, this, rate, continued, for, 4, 5, gyr, the, satellite, would, have, lost, approximately, 30, of, its, initial, mass, a, similar, value, is, obtained, by, assuming, that, the, initial, densities, of, enceladus, and, mimas, were, equal, it, suggests, that, tectonics, in, the, south, polar, region, is, probably, mainly, related, to, subsidence, and, associated, subduction, caused, by, the, process, of, mass, loss, in, 2016, a, study, of, how, the, orbits, of, saturn, s, moons, should, have, changed, due, to, tidal, effects, suggested, that, all, of, saturn, s, satellites, inward, of, titan, including, enceladus, whose, geologic, activity, was, used, to, derive, the, strength, of, tidal, effects, on, saturn, s, satellites, may, have, formed, as, little, as, 100, million, years, ago, a, later, study, from, 2019, estimated, that, the, ocean, is, around, one, billion, years, old, enceladus, ejects, plumes, of, salted, water, laced, with, grains, of, silica, rich, sand, nitrogen, in, ammonia, and, organic, molecules, including, trace, amounts, of, simple, hydrocarbons, such, as, methane, ch, 4, propane, c, 3, h, 8, acetylene, c, 2, h, 2, and, formaldehyde, ch, 2, o, which, are, carbon, bearing, molecules, this, indicates, that, hydrothermal, activity, an, energy, source, may, be, at, work, in, enceladus, s, subsurface, ocean, models, indicate, that, the, large, rocky, core, is, porous, allowing, water, to, flow, through, it, transferring, heat, and, chemicals, it, was, confirmed, by, observations, and, other, research, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, a, geochemical, source, of, energy, that, can, be, metabolized, by, methanogen, microbes, to, provide, energy, for, life, could, be, present, if, as, models, suggest, enceladus, s, salty, ocean, has, an, alkaline, ph, from, serpentinization, of, chondritic, rock, the, presence, of, an, internal, global, salty, ocean, with, an, aquatic, environment, supported, by, global, ocean, circulation, patterns, with, an, energy, source, and, complex, organic, compounds, in, contact, with, enceladus, s, rocky, core, may, advance, the, study, of, astrobiology, and, the, study, of, potentially, habitable, environments, for, microbial, extraterrestrial, life, geochemical, modeling, results, concerning, not, yet, detected, phosphorus, indicate, the, moon, meets, potential, abiogenesis, requirements, however, phosphates, have, been, detected, from, a, cryovolcanic, plume, detected, by, cassini, and, is, discussed, in, a, paper, in, the, june, 14, 2023, issue, of, nature, entitled, detection, of, phosphates, originating, from, enceladus, s, ocean, the, presence, of, a, wide, range, of, organic, compounds, and, ammonia, indicates, their, source, may, be, similar, to, the, water, rock, reactions, known, to, occur, on, earth, and, that, are, known, to, support, life, therefore, several, robotic, missions, have, been, proposed, to, further, explore, enceladus, and, assess, its, habitability, some, of, the, proposed, missions, are, journey, to, enceladus, and, titan, jet, enceladus, explorer, en, ex, enceladus, life, finder, elf, life, investigation, for, enceladus, life, and, enceladus, life, signatures, and, habitability, elsah, in, june, 2023, astronomers, reported, that, the, presence, of, phosphates, on, enceladus, has, been, detected, completing, the, discovery, of, all, the, basic, chemical, ingredients, for, life, on, the, moon, on, december, 14, 2023, astronomers, reported, the, first, time, discovery, in, the, plumes, of, enceladus, of, hydrogen, cyanide, a, possible, chemical, essential, for, life, as, we, know, it, as, well, as, other, organic, molecules, some, of, which, are, yet, to, be, better, identified, and, understood, according, to, the, researchers, these, compounds, could, potentially, support, extant, microbial, communities, or, drive, complex, organic, synthesis, leading, to, the, origin, of, life, on, april, 13, 2017, nasa, announced, the, discovery, of, possible, hydrothermal, activity, on, enceladus, s, sub, surface, ocean, floor, in, 2015, the, cassini, probe, made, a, close, fly, by, of, enceladus, s, south, pole, flying, within, 48, 3, km, 30, 0, mi, of, the, surface, as, well, as, through, a, plume, in, the, process, a, mass, spectrometer, on, the, craft, detected, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, from, the, plume, and, after, months, of, analysis, the, conclusion, was, made, that, the, hydrogen, was, most, likely, the, result, of, hydrothermal, activity, beneath, the, surface, it, has, been, speculated, that, such, activity, could, be, a, potential, oasis, of, habitability, the, presence, of, ample, hydrogen, in, enceladus, s, ocean, means, that, microbes, if, any, exist, there, could, use, it, to, obtain, energy, by, combining, the, hydrogen, with, carbon, dioxide, dissolved, in, the, water, the, chemical, reaction, is, known, as, methanogenesis, because, it, produces, methane, as, a, byproduct, and, is, at, the, root, of, the, tree, of, life, on, earth, the, birthplace, of, all, life, that, is, known, to, exist, the, two, voyager, spacecraft, made, the, first, close, up, images, of, enceladus, voyager, 1, was, the, first, to, fly, past, enceladus, at, a, distance, of, 202, 000, km, on, november, 12, 1980, images, acquired, from, this, distance, had, very, poor, spatial, resolution, but, revealed, a, highly, reflective, surface, devoid, of, impact, craters, indicating, a, youthful, surface, voyager, 1, also, confirmed, that, enceladus, was, embedded, in, the, densest, part, of, saturn, s, diffuse, e, ring, combined, with, the, apparent, youthful, appearance, of, the, surface, voyager, scientists, suggested, that, the, e, ring, consisted, of, particles, vented, from, enceladus, s, surface, voyager, 2, passed, closer, to, enceladus, 87, 010, km, on, august, 26, 1981, allowing, higher, resolution, images, to, be, obtained, these, images, showed, a, young, surface, they, also, revealed, a, surface, with, different, regions, with, vastly, different, surface, ages, with, a, heavily, cratered, mid, to, high, northern, latitude, region, and, a, lightly, cratered, region, closer, to, the, equator, this, geologic, diversity, contrasts, with, the, ancient, heavily, cratered, surface, of, mimas, another, moon, of, saturn, slightly, smaller, than, enceladus, the, geologically, youthful, terrains, came, as, a, great, surprise, to, the, scientific, community, because, no, theory, was, then, able, to, predict, that, such, a, small, and, cold, compared, to, jupiter, s, highly, active, moon, io, celestial, body, could, bear, signs, of, such, activity, the, answers, to, many, remaining, mysteries, of, enceladus, had, to, wait, until, the, arrival, of, the, cassini, spacecraft, on, july, 1, 2004, when, it, entered, orbit, around, saturn, given, the, results, from, the, voyager, 2, images, enceladus, was, considered, a, priority, target, by, the, cassini, mission, planners, and, several, targeted, flybys, within, 1, 500, km, of, the, surface, were, planned, as, well, as, numerous, non, targeted, opportunities, within, 100, 000, km, of, enceladus, the, flybys, have, yielded, significant, information, concerning, enceladus, s, surface, as, well, as, the, discovery, of, water, vapor, with, traces, of, simple, hydrocarbons, venting, from, the, geologically, active, south, polar, region, these, discoveries, prompted, the, adjustment, of, cassini, s, flight, plan, to, allow, closer, flybys, of, enceladus, including, an, encounter, in, march, 2008, that, took, it, to, within, 48, km, of, the, surface, cassini, s, extended, mission, included, seven, close, flybys, of, enceladus, between, july, 2008, and, july, 2010, including, two, passes, at, only, 50, km, in, the, later, half, of, 2008, cassini, performed, a, flyby, on, october, 28, 2015, passing, as, close, as, 49, km, 30, mi, and, through, a, plume, confirmation, of, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, would, be, an, independent, line, of, evidence, that, hydrothermal, activity, is, taking, place, in, the, enceladus, seafloor, increasing, its, habitability, cassini, has, provided, strong, evidence, that, enceladus, has, an, ocean, with, an, energy, source, nutrients, and, organic, molecules, making, enceladus, one, of, the, best, places, for, the, study, of, potentially, habitable, environments, for, extraterrestrial, life, on, december, 14, 2023, astronomers, reported, the, first, time, discovery, in, the, plumes, of, enceladus, of, hydrogen, cyanide, a, possible, chemical, essential, for, life, as, we, know, it, as, well, as, other, organic, molecules, some, of, which, are, yet, to, be, better, identified, and, understood, according, to, the, researchers, these, compounds, could, potentially, support, extant, microbial, communities, or, drive, complex, organic, synthesis, leading, to, the, origin, of, life, the, discoveries, cassini, made, at, enceladus, have, prompted, studies, into, follow, up, mission, concepts, including, a, probe, flyby, journey, to, enceladus, and, titan, or, jet, to, analyze, plume, contents, in, situ, a, lander, by, the, german, aerospace, center, to, study, the, habitability, potential, of, its, subsurface, ocean, enceladus, explorer, and, two, astrobiology, oriented, mission, concepts, the, enceladus, life, finder, and, life, investigation, for, enceladus, life, the, european, space, agency, esa, was, assessing, concepts, in, 2008, to, send, a, probe, to, enceladus, in, a, mission, to, be, combined, with, studies, of, titan, titan, saturn, system, mission, tssm, tssm, was, a, joint, nasa, esa, flagship, class, proposal, for, exploration, of, saturn, s, moons, with, a, focus, on, enceladus, and, it, was, competing, against, the, europa, jupiter, system, mission, ejsm, proposal, for, funding, in, february, 2009, it, was, announced, that, nasa, esa, had, given, the, ejsm, mission, priority, ahead, of, tssm, although, tssm, will, continue, to, be, studied, and, evaluated, in, november, 2017, russian, billionaire, yuri, milner, expressed, interest, in, funding, a, low, cost, privately, funded, mission, to, enceladus, which, can, be, launched, relatively, soon, in, september, 2018, nasa, and, the, breakthrough, initiatives, founded, by, milner, signed, a, cooperation, agreement, for, the, mission, s, initial, concept, phase, the, spacecraft, would, be, low, cost, low, mass, and, would, be, launched, at, high, speed, on, an, affordable, rocket, the, spacecraft, would, be, directed, to, perform, a, single, flyby, through, enceladus, plumes, in, order, to, sample, and, analyze, its, content, for, biosignatures, nasa, provided, scientific, and, technical, expertise, through, various, reviews, from, march, 2019, to, december, 2019, in, 2022, the, planetary, science, decadal, survey, by, the, national, academy, of, sciences, recommended, that, nasa, prioritize, its, newest, probe, concept, the, enceladus, orbilander, as, a, flagship, class, mission, alongside, its, newest, concepts, for, a, mars, sample, return, mission, and, the, uranus, orbiter, and, probe, the, enceladus, orbilander, would, be, launched, on, a, similarly, affordable, rocket, but, would, cost, about, 5, billion, and, be, designed, to, endure, eighteen, months, in, orbit, inspecting, enceladus, plumes, before, landing, and, spending, two, earth, years, conducting, surface, astrobiology, research
