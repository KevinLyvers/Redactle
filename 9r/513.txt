phenol, also, known, as, carbolic, acid, phenolic, acid, or, benzenol, is, an, aromatic, organic, compound, with, the, molecular, formula, c, 6, h, 5, oh, it, is, a, white, crystalline, solid, that, is, volatile, the, molecule, consists, of, a, phenyl, group, c, 6, h, 5, bonded, to, a, hydroxy, group, oh, mildly, acidic, it, requires, careful, handling, because, it, can, cause, chemical, burns, phenol, was, first, extracted, from, coal, tar, but, today, is, produced, on, a, large, scale, about, 7, million, tonnes, a, year, from, petroleum, derived, feedstocks, it, is, an, important, industrial, commodity, as, a, precursor, to, many, materials, and, useful, compounds, it, is, primarily, used, to, synthesize, plastics, and, related, materials, phenol, and, its, chemical, derivatives, are, essential, for, production, of, polycarbonates, epoxies, explosives, bakelite, nylon, detergents, herbicides, such, as, phenoxy, herbicides, and, numerous, pharmaceutical, drugs, phenol, is, an, organic, compound, appreciably, soluble, in, water, with, about, 84, 2, g, dissolving, in, 1000, ml, 0, 895, m, homogeneous, mixtures, of, phenol, and, water, at, phenol, to, water, mass, ratios, of, 2, 6, and, higher, are, possible, the, sodium, salt, of, phenol, sodium, phenoxide, is, far, more, water, soluble, it, is, a, combustible, solid, nfpa, rating, 2, when, heated, phenol, produces, flammable, vapors, that, are, explosive, at, concentrations, of, 3, to, 10, in, air, carbon, dioxide, or, dry, chemical, extinguishers, should, be, used, to, fight, phenol, fires, phenol, is, a, weak, acid, ph, 6, 6, in, aqueous, solution, in, the, ph, range, ca, 8, 12, it, is, in, equilibrium, with, the, phenolate, anion, c, 6, h, 5, o, also, called, phenoxide, or, carbolate, phenol, is, more, acidic, than, aliphatic, alcohols, its, enhanced, acidity, is, attributed, to, resonance, stabilization, of, phenolate, anion, in, this, way, the, negative, charge, on, oxygen, is, delocalized, on, to, the, ortho, and, para, carbon, atoms, through, the, pi, system, an, alternative, explanation, involves, the, sigma, framework, postulating, that, the, dominant, effect, is, the, induction, from, the, more, electronegative, sp, 2, hybridised, carbons, the, comparatively, more, powerful, inductive, withdrawal, of, electron, density, that, is, provided, by, the, sp, 2, system, compared, to, an, sp, 3, system, allows, for, great, stabilization, of, the, oxyanion, in, support, of, the, second, explanation, the, p, k, a, of, the, enol, of, acetone, in, water, is, 10, 9, making, it, only, slightly, less, acidic, than, phenol, p, k, a, 10, 0, thus, the, greater, number, of, resonance, structures, available, to, phenoxide, compared, to, acetone, enolate, seems, to, contribute, little, to, its, stabilization, however, the, situation, changes, when, solvation, effects, are, excluded, in, carbon, tetrachloride, and, in, alkane, solvents, phenol, hydrogen, bonds, with, a, wide, range, of, lewis, bases, such, as, pyridine, diethyl, ether, and, diethyl, sulfide, the, enthalpies, of, adduct, formation, and, the, oh, ir, frequency, shifts, accompanying, adduct, formation, have, been, compiled, phenol, is, classified, as, a, hard, acid, phenol, exhibits, keto, enol, tautomerism, with, its, unstable, keto, tautomer, cyclohexadienone, but, the, effect, is, nearly, negligible, the, equilibrium, constant, for, enolisation, is, approximately, 10, 13, which, means, only, one, in, every, ten, trillion, molecules, is, in, the, keto, form, at, any, moment, the, small, amount, of, stabilisation, gained, by, exchanging, a, c, c, bond, for, a, c, o, bond, is, more, than, offset, by, the, large, destabilisation, resulting, from, the, loss, of, aromaticity, phenol, therefore, exists, essentially, entirely, in, the, enol, form, 4, 4, substituted, cyclohexadienone, can, undergo, a, dienone, phenol, rearrangement, in, acid, conditions, and, form, stable, 3, 4, disubstituted, phenol, for, substituted, phenols, several, factors, can, favor, the, keto, tautomer, a, additional, hydroxy, groups, see, resorcinol, b, annulation, as, in, the, formation, of, naphthols, and, c, deprotonation, to, give, the, phenolate, phenoxides, are, enolates, stabilised, by, aromaticity, under, normal, circumstances, phenoxide, is, more, reactive, at, the, oxygen, position, but, the, oxygen, position, is, a, hard, nucleophile, whereas, the, alpha, carbon, positions, tend, to, be, soft, phenol, is, highly, reactive, toward, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, the, enhanced, nucleophilicity, is, attributed, to, donation, pi, electron, density, from, o, into, the, ring, many, groups, can, be, attached, to, the, ring, via, halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and, related, processes, phenol, is, so, strongly, activated, that, bromination, and, chlorination, lead, readily, to, polysubstitution, the, reaction, affords, 2, and, 4, substituted, derivatives, the, regiochemistry, of, halogenation, changes, in, strongly, acidic, solutions, where, phoh, 2, predominates, phenol, reacts, with, dilute, nitric, acid, at, room, temperature, to, give, a, mixture, of, 2, nitrophenol, and, 4, nitrophenol, while, with, concentrated, nitric, acid, additional, nitro, groups, are, introduced, e, g, to, give, 2, 4, 6, trinitrophenol, friedel, crafts, alkylations, of, phenol, and, its, derivatives, often, proceed, without, catalysts, alkylating, agents, include, alkyl, halides, alkenes, and, ketones, thus, adamantyl, 1, bromide, dicyclopentadiene, and, cyclohexanones, give, respectively, 4, adamantylphenol, a, bis, 2, hydroxyphenyl, derivative, and, a, 4, cyclohexylphenols, alcohols, and, hydroperoxides, alkylate, phenols, in, the, presence, of, solid, acid, catalysts, e, g, certain, zeolite, cresols, and, cumyl, phenols, can, be, produced, in, that, way, aqueous, solutions, of, phenol, are, weakly, acidic, and, turn, blue, litmus, slightly, to, red, phenol, is, neutralized, by, sodium, hydroxide, forming, sodium, phenate, or, phenolate, but, being, weaker, than, carbonic, acid, it, cannot, be, neutralized, by, sodium, bicarbonate, or, sodium, carbonate, to, liberate, carbon, dioxide, when, a, mixture, of, phenol, and, benzoyl, chloride, are, shaken, in, presence, of, dilute, sodium, hydroxide, solution, phenyl, benzoate, is, formed, this, is, an, example, of, the, schotten, baumann, reaction, phenol, is, reduced, to, benzene, when, it, is, distilled, with, zinc, dust, or, when, its, vapour, is, passed, over, granules, of, zinc, at, 400, c, when, phenol, is, treated, with, diazomethane, in, the, presence, of, boron, trifluoride, bf, 3, anisole, is, obtained, as, the, main, product, and, nitrogen, gas, as, a, byproduct, phenol, and, its, derivatives, react, with, iron, iii, chloride, to, give, intensely, colored, solutions, containing, phenoxide, complexes, because, of, phenol, s, commercial, importance, many, methods, have, been, developed, for, its, production, but, the, cumene, process, is, the, dominant, technology, accounting, for, 95, of, production, 2003, is, the, cumene, process, also, called, hock, process, it, involves, the, partial, oxidation, of, cumene, isopropylbenzene, via, the, hock, rearrangement, compared, to, most, other, processes, the, cumene, process, uses, mild, conditions, and, inexpensive, raw, materials, for, the, process, to, be, economical, both, phenol, and, the, acetone, by, product, must, be, in, demand, in, 2010, worldwide, demand, for, acetone, was, approximately, 6, 7, million, tonnes, 83, percent, of, which, was, satisfied, with, acetone, produced, by, the, cumene, process, a, route, analogous, to, the, cumene, process, begins, with, cyclohexylbenzene, it, is, oxidized, to, a, hydroperoxide, akin, to, the, production, of, cumene, hydroperoxide, via, the, hock, rearrangement, cyclohexylbenzene, hydroperoxide, cleaves, to, give, phenol, and, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanone, is, an, important, precursor, to, some, nylons, the, direct, oxidation, of, benzene, c, 6, h, 6, to, phenol, is, possible, but, it, has, not, been, commercialized, nitrous, oxide, is, a, potentially, green, oxidant, that, is, a, more, potent, oxidant, than, o, 2, routes, for, the, generation, of, nitrous, oxide, however, remain, uncompetitive, an, electrosynthesis, employing, alternating, current, gives, phenol, from, benzene, the, oxidation, of, toluene, as, developed, by, dow, chemical, involves, copper, catalyzed, reaction, of, molten, sodium, benzoate, with, air, the, reaction, is, proposed, to, proceed, via, formation, of, benzyoylsalicylate, autoxidation, of, cyclohexylbenzene, give, the, hydroperoxide, decomposition, of, this, hydroperoxide, affords, cyclohexanone, and, phenol, early, methods, relied, on, extraction, of, phenol, from, coal, derivatives, or, the, hydrolysis, of, benzene, derivatives, the, original, commercial, route, was, developed, by, bayer, and, monsanto, in, the, early, 1900s, based, on, discoveries, by, wurtz, and, kekule, the, method, involves, the, reaction, of, strong, base, with, benzenesulfonic, acid, proceeding, by, the, reaction, of, hydroxide, with, sodium, benzenesulfonate, to, give, sodium, phenoxide, acidification, of, the, latter, gives, phenol, the, net, conversion, is, chlorobenzene, can, be, hydrolyzed, to, phenol, using, base, dow, process, or, steam, raschig, hooker, process, these, methods, suffer, from, the, cost, of, the, chlorobenzene, and, the, need, to, dispose, of, the, chloride, byproduct, phenol, is, also, a, recoverable, byproduct, of, coal, pyrolysis, in, the, lummus, process, the, oxidation, of, toluene, to, benzoic, acid, is, conducted, separately, phenyldiazonium, salts, hydrolyze, to, phenol, the, method, is, of, no, commercial, interest, since, the, precursor, is, expensive, salicylic, acid, decarboxylates, to, phenol, the, major, uses, of, phenol, consuming, two, thirds, of, its, production, involve, its, conversion, to, precursors, for, plastics, condensation, with, acetone, gives, bisphenol, a, a, key, precursor, to, polycarbonates, and, epoxide, resins, condensation, of, phenol, alkylphenols, or, diphenols, with, formaldehyde, gives, phenolic, resins, a, famous, example, of, which, is, bakelite, partial, hydrogenation, of, phenol, gives, cyclohexanone, a, precursor, to, nylon, nonionic, detergents, are, produced, by, alkylation, of, phenol, to, give, the, alkylphenols, e, g, nonylphenol, which, are, then, subjected, to, ethoxylation, phenol, is, also, a, versatile, precursor, to, a, large, collection, of, drugs, most, notably, aspirin, but, also, many, herbicides, and, pharmaceutical, drugs, phenol, is, a, component, in, liquid, liquid, phenol, chloroform, extraction, technique, used, in, molecular, biology, for, obtaining, nucleic, acids, from, tissues, or, cell, culture, samples, depending, on, the, ph, of, the, solution, either, dna, or, rna, can, be, extracted, phenol, is, so, inexpensive, that, it, also, attracts, many, small, scale, uses, it, is, a, component, of, industrial, paint, strippers, used, in, the, aviation, industry, for, the, removal, of, epoxy, polyurethane, and, other, chemically, resistant, coatings, due, to, safety, concerns, phenol, is, banned, from, use, in, cosmetic, products, in, the, european, union, and, canada, phenol, was, widely, used, as, an, antiseptic, and, it, is, used, in, the, production, of, carbolic, soap, concentrated, phenol, liquids, are, used, for, permanent, treatment, of, ingrown, toe, and, finger, nails, a, procedure, known, as, a, chemical, matrixectomy, the, procedure, was, first, described, by, otto, boll, in, 1945, since, that, time, phenol, has, become, the, chemical, of, choice, for, chemical, matrixectomies, performed, by, podiatrists, concentrated, liquid, phenol, can, be, used, topically, as, a, local, anesthetic, for, otology, procedures, such, as, myringotomy, and, tympanotomy, tube, placement, as, an, alternative, to, general, anesthesia, or, other, local, anesthetics, it, also, has, hemostatic, and, antiseptic, qualities, that, make, it, ideal, for, this, use, phenol, spray, usually, at, 1, 4, phenol, as, an, active, ingredient, is, used, medically, to, treat, sore, throat, it, is, the, active, ingredient, in, some, oral, analgesics, such, as, chloraseptic, spray, tcp, and, carmex, phenol, was, discovered, in, 1834, by, friedlieb, ferdinand, runge, who, extracted, it, in, impure, form, from, coal, tar, runge, called, phenol, karbols, ure, coal, oil, acid, carbolic, acid, coal, tar, remained, the, primary, source, until, the, development, of, the, petrochemical, industry, french, chemist, auguste, laurent, extracted, phenol, in, its, pure, form, as, a, derivative, of, benzene, in, 1841, in, 1836, auguste, laurent, coined, the, name, ph, ne, for, benzene, this, is, the, root, of, the, word, phenol, and, phenyl, in, 1843, french, chemist, charles, gerhardt, coined, the, name, ph, nol, the, antiseptic, properties, of, phenol, were, used, by, sir, joseph, lister, in, his, pioneering, technique, of, antiseptic, surgery, lister, decided, that, the, wounds, had, to, be, thoroughly, cleaned, he, then, covered, the, wounds, with, a, piece, of, rag, or, lint, covered, in, phenol, the, skin, irritation, caused, by, continual, exposure, to, phenol, eventually, led, to, the, introduction, of, aseptic, germ, free, techniques, in, surgery, lister, s, work, was, inspired, by, the, works, and, experiments, of, his, contemporary, louis, pasteur, in, sterilizing, various, biological, media, he, theorized, that, if, germs, could, be, killed, or, prevented, no, infection, would, occur, lister, reasoned, that, a, chemical, could, be, used, to, destroy, the, micro, organisms, that, cause, infection, meanwhile, in, carlisle, england, officials, were, experimenting, with, sewage, treatment, using, carbolic, acid, to, reduce, the, smell, of, sewage, cesspools, having, heard, of, these, developments, and, having, previously, experimented, with, other, chemicals, for, antiseptic, purposes, without, much, success, lister, decided, to, try, carbolic, acid, as, a, wound, antiseptic, he, had, his, first, chance, on, august, 12, 1865, when, he, received, a, patient, an, eleven, year, old, boy, with, a, tibia, bone, fracture, which, pierced, the, skin, of, his, lower, leg, ordinarily, amputation, would, be, the, only, solution, however, lister, decided, to, try, carbolic, acid, after, setting, the, bone, and, supporting, the, leg, with, splints, he, soaked, clean, cotton, towels, in, undiluted, carbolic, acid, and, applied, them, to, the, wound, covered, with, a, layer, of, tin, foil, leaving, them, for, four, days, when, he, checked, the, wound, lister, was, pleasantly, surprised, to, find, no, signs, of, infection, just, redness, near, the, edges, of, the, wound, from, mild, burning, by, the, carbolic, acid, reapplying, fresh, bandages, with, diluted, carbolic, acid, the, boy, was, able, to, walk, home, after, about, six, weeks, of, treatment, by, 16, march, 1867, when, the, first, results, of, lister, s, work, were, published, in, the, lancet, he, had, treated, a, total, of, eleven, patients, using, his, new, antiseptic, method, of, those, only, one, had, died, and, that, was, through, a, complication, that, was, nothing, to, do, with, lister, s, wound, dressing, technique, now, for, the, first, time, patients, with, compound, fractures, were, likely, to, leave, the, hospital, with, all, their, limbs, intact, before, antiseptic, operations, were, introduced, at, the, hospital, there, were, sixteen, deaths, in, thirty, five, surgical, cases, almost, one, in, every, two, patients, died, after, antiseptic, surgery, was, introduced, in, the, summer, of, 1865, there, were, only, six, deaths, in, forty, cases, the, mortality, rate, had, dropped, from, almost, 50, per, cent, to, around, 15, per, cent, it, was, a, remarkable, achievement, phenol, was, the, main, ingredient, of, the, carbolic, smoke, ball, an, ineffective, device, marketed, in, london, in, the, 19th, century, as, protection, against, influenza, and, other, ailments, and, the, subject, of, the, famous, law, case, carlill, v, carbolic, smoke, ball, company, the, toxic, effect, of, phenol, on, the, central, nervous, system, causes, sudden, collapse, and, loss, of, consciousness, in, both, humans, and, animals, a, state, of, cramping, precedes, these, symptoms, because, of, the, motor, activity, controlled, by, the, central, nervous, system, injections, of, phenol, were, used, as, a, means, of, individual, execution, by, nazi, germany, during, the, second, world, war, it, was, originally, used, by, the, nazis, in, 1939, as, part, of, the, mass, murder, of, disabled, people, under, aktion, t4, the, germans, learned, that, extermination, of, smaller, groups, was, more, economical, by, injection, of, each, victim, with, phenol, phenol, injections, were, given, to, thousands, of, people, maximilian, kolbe, was, also, murdered, with, a, phenol, injection, after, surviving, two, weeks, of, dehydration, and, starvation, in, auschwitz, when, he, volunteered, to, die, in, place, of, a, stranger, approximately, one, gram, is, sufficient, to, cause, death, phenol, is, a, normal, metabolic, product, excreted, in, quantities, up, to, 40, mg, l, in, human, urine, the, temporal, gland, secretion, of, male, elephants, showed, the, presence, of, phenol, and, 4, methylphenol, during, musth, it, is, also, one, of, the, chemical, compounds, found, in, castoreum, this, compound, is, ingested, from, the, plants, the, beaver, eats, phenol, is, a, measurable, component, in, the, aroma, and, taste, of, the, distinctive, islay, scotch, whisky, generally, 30, ppm, but, it, can, be, over, 160ppm, in, the, malted, barley, used, to, produce, whisky, this, amount, is, different, from, and, presumably, higher, than, the, amount, in, the, distillate, cryptanaerobacter, phenolicus, is, a, bacterium, species, that, produces, benzoate, from, phenol, via, 4, hydroxybenzoate, rhodococcus, phenolicus, is, a, bacterium, species, able, to, degrade, phenol, as, sole, carbon, source, phenol, and, its, vapors, are, corrosive, to, the, eyes, the, skin, and, the, respiratory, tract, its, corrosive, effect, on, skin, and, mucous, membranes, is, due, to, a, protein, degenerating, effect, repeated, or, prolonged, skin, contact, with, phenol, may, cause, dermatitis, or, even, second, and, third, degree, burns, inhalation, of, phenol, vapor, may, cause, lung, edema, the, substance, may, cause, harmful, effects, on, the, central, nervous, system, and, heart, resulting, in, dysrhythmia, seizures, and, coma, the, kidneys, may, be, affected, as, well, long, term, or, repeated, exposure, of, the, substance, may, have, harmful, effects, on, the, liver, and, kidneys, there, is, no, evidence, that, phenol, causes, cancer, in, humans, besides, its, hydrophobic, effects, another, mechanism, for, the, toxicity, of, phenol, may, be, the, formation, of, phenoxyl, radicals, since, phenol, is, absorbed, through, the, skin, relatively, quickly, systemic, poisoning, can, occur, in, addition, to, the, local, caustic, burns, resorptive, poisoning, by, a, large, quantity, of, phenol, can, occur, even, with, only, a, small, area, of, skin, rapidly, leading, to, paralysis, of, the, central, nervous, system, and, a, severe, drop, in, body, temperature, the, ld, 50, for, oral, toxicity, is, less, than, 500, mg, kg, for, dogs, rabbits, or, mice, the, minimum, lethal, human, dose, was, cited, as, 140, mg, kg, the, agency, for, toxic, substances, and, disease, registry, atsdr, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, states, the, fatal, dose, for, ingestion, of, phenol, is, from, 1, to, 32, g, chemical, burns, from, skin, exposures, can, be, decontaminated, by, washing, with, polyethylene, glycol, isopropyl, alcohol, or, perhaps, even, copious, amounts, of, water, removal, of, contaminated, clothing, is, required, as, well, as, immediate, hospital, treatment, for, large, splashes, this, is, particularly, important, if, the, phenol, is, mixed, with, chloroform, a, commonly, used, mixture, in, molecular, biology, for, dna, and, rna, purification, phenol, is, also, a, reproductive, toxin, causing, increased, risk, of, miscarriage, and, low, birth, weight, indicating, retarded, development, in, utero, the, word, phenol, is, also, used, to, refer, to, any, compound, that, contains, a, six, membered, aromatic, ring, bonded, directly, to, a, hydroxyl, group, oh, thus, phenols, are, a, class, of, organic, compounds, of, which, the, phenol, discussed, in, this, article, is, the, simplest, member
