a, set, of, primary, colors, or, primary, colours, see, spelling, differences, consists, of, colorants, or, colored, lights, that, can, be, mixed, in, varying, amounts, to, produce, a, gamut, of, colors, this, is, the, essential, method, used, to, create, the, perception, of, a, broad, range, of, colors, in, e, g, electronic, displays, color, printing, and, paintings, perceptions, associated, with, a, given, combination, of, primary, colors, can, be, predicted, by, an, appropriate, mixing, model, e, g, additive, subtractive, that, reflects, the, physics, of, how, light, interacts, with, physical, media, and, ultimately, the, retina, the, most, common, color, mixing, models, are, the, additive, primary, colors, red, green, blue, and, the, subtractive, primary, colors, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, yellow, and, blue, are, also, commonly, taught, as, primary, colours, despite, some, criticism, due, to, its, lack, of, scientific, basis, primary, colors, can, also, be, conceptual, not, necessarily, real, either, as, additive, mathematical, elements, of, a, color, space, or, as, irreducible, phenomenological, categories, in, domains, such, as, psychology, and, philosophy, color, space, primaries, are, precisely, defined, and, empirically, rooted, in, psychophysical, colorimetry, experiments, which, are, foundational, for, understanding, color, vision, primaries, of, some, color, spaces, are, complete, that, is, all, visible, colors, are, described, in, terms, of, their, primaries, weighted, by, nonnegative, primary, intensity, coefficients, but, necessarily, imaginary, that, is, there, is, no, plausible, way, that, those, primary, colors, could, be, represented, physically, or, perceived, phenomenological, accounts, of, primary, colors, such, as, the, psychological, primaries, have, been, used, as, the, conceptual, basis, for, practical, color, applications, even, though, they, are, not, a, quantitative, description, in, and, of, themselves, sets, of, color, space, primaries, are, generally, arbitrary, in, the, sense, that, there, is, no, one, set, of, primaries, that, can, be, considered, the, canonical, set, primary, pigments, or, light, sources, are, selected, for, a, given, application, on, the, basis, of, subjective, preferences, as, well, as, practical, factors, such, as, cost, stability, availability, etc, the, concept, of, primary, colors, has, a, long, complex, history, the, choice, of, primary, colors, has, changed, over, time, in, different, domains, that, study, color, descriptions, of, primary, colors, come, from, areas, including, philosophy, art, history, color, order, systems, and, scientific, work, involving, the, physics, of, light, and, perception, of, color, art, education, materials, commonly, use, red, yellow, and, blue, as, primary, colors, sometimes, suggesting, that, they, can, mix, all, colors, no, set, of, real, colorants, or, lights, can, mix, all, possible, colors, however, in, physics, the, three, primary, colors, are, typically, red, green, and, blue, after, the, different, types, of, photoreceptor, pigments, in, the, cone, cells, a, color, model, is, an, abstract, model, intended, to, describe, the, ways, that, colors, behave, especially, in, color, mixing, most, color, models, are, defined, by, the, interaction, of, multiple, primary, colors, since, most, humans, are, trichromatic, color, models, that, want, to, reproduce, a, meaningful, portion, of, a, human, s, perceptual, gamut, must, use, at, least, three, primaries, more, than, three, primaries, are, allowed, for, example, to, increase, the, size, of, the, gamut, of, the, color, space, but, the, entire, human, perceptual, gamut, can, be, reproduced, with, just, three, primaries, albeit, imaginary, ones, as, in, the, cie, xyz, color, space, some, humans, and, most, mammals, are, dichromats, corresponding, to, specific, forms, of, color, blindness, in, which, color, vision, is, mediated, by, only, two, of, the, types, of, color, receptors, dichromats, require, only, two, primaries, to, reproduce, their, entire, gamut, and, their, participation, in, color, matching, experiments, was, essential, in, the, determination, of, cone, fundamentals, leading, to, all, modern, color, spaces, despite, most, vertebrates, being, tetrachromatic, and, therefore, requiring, four, primaries, to, reproduce, their, entire, gamut, there, is, only, one, scholarly, report, of, a, functional, human, tetrachromat, for, which, trichromatic, color, models, are, insufficient, the, perception, elicited, by, multiple, light, sources, co, stimulating, the, same, area, of, the, retina, is, additive, i, e, predicted, via, summing, the, spectral, power, distributions, the, intensity, of, each, wavelength, of, the, individual, light, sources, assuming, a, color, matching, context, 17, 22, for, example, a, purple, spotlight, on, a, dark, background, could, be, matched, with, coincident, blue, and, red, spotlights, that, are, both, dimmer, than, the, purple, spotlight, if, the, intensity, of, the, purple, spotlight, was, doubled, it, could, be, matched, by, doubling, the, intensities, of, both, the, red, and, blue, spotlights, that, matched, the, original, purple, the, principles, of, additive, color, mixing, are, embodied, in, grassmann, s, laws, additive, mixing, is, sometimes, described, as, additive, color, matching, to, emphasize, the, fact, the, predictions, based, on, additivity, only, apply, assuming, the, color, matching, context, additivity, relies, on, assumptions, of, the, color, matching, context, such, as, the, match, being, in, the, foveal, field, of, view, under, appropriate, luminance, etc, additive, mixing, of, coincident, spot, lights, was, applied, in, the, experiments, used, to, derive, the, cie, 1931, colorspace, see, color, space, primaries, section, the, original, monochromatic, primaries, of, the, wavelengths, of, 435, 8, nm, violet, 546, 1, nm, green, and, 700, nm, red, were, used, in, this, application, due, to, the, convenience, they, afforded, to, the, experimental, work, small, red, green, and, blue, elements, with, controllable, brightness, in, electronic, displays, mix, additively, from, an, appropriate, viewing, distance, to, synthesize, compelling, colored, images, this, specific, type, of, additive, mixing, is, described, as, partitive, mixing, 21, 22, red, green, and, blue, light, are, popular, primaries, for, partitive, mixing, since, primary, lights, with, those, hues, provide, a, large, color, triangle, gamut, the, exact, colors, chosen, for, additive, primaries, are, a, compromise, between, the, available, technology, including, considerations, such, as, cost, and, power, usage, and, the, need, for, large, chromaticity, gamut, for, example, in, 1953, the, ntsc, specified, primaries, that, were, representative, of, the, phosphors, available, in, that, era, for, color, crts, over, decades, market, pressures, for, brighter, colors, resulted, in, crts, using, primaries, that, deviated, significantly, from, the, original, standard, currently, itu, r, bt, 709, 5, primaries, are, typical, for, high, definition, television, the, subtractive, color, mixing, model, predicts, the, resultant, spectral, power, distribution, of, light, filtered, through, overlaid, partially, absorbing, materials, usually, in, the, context, of, an, underlying, reflective, surface, such, as, white, paper, 22, 23, each, layer, partially, absorbs, some, wavelengths, of, light, from, the, illumination, while, letting, others, pass, through, resulting, in, a, colored, appearance, the, resultant, spectral, power, distribution, is, predicted, by, the, wavelength, by, wavelength, product, of, the, spectral, reflectance, of, the, illumination, and, the, product, of, the, spectral, reflectances, of, all, of, the, layers, overlapping, layers, of, ink, in, printing, mix, subtractively, over, reflecting, white, paper, while, the, reflected, light, mixes, in, a, partitive, way, to, generate, color, images, 30, 33, importantly, unlike, additive, mixture, the, color, of, the, mixture, is, not, well, predicted, by, the, colors, of, the, individual, dyes, or, inks, the, typical, number, of, inks, in, such, a, printing, process, is, 3, cmy, or, 4, cmyk, but, can, commonly, range, to, 6, e, g, pantone, hexachrome, in, general, using, fewer, inks, as, primaries, results, in, more, economical, printing, but, using, more, may, result, in, better, color, reproduction, cyan, c, magenta, m, and, yellow, y, are, good, chromatic, subtractive, primaries, in, that, filters, with, those, colors, can, be, overlaid, to, yield, a, surprisingly, large, chromaticity, gamut, a, black, k, ink, from, the, older, key, plate, is, also, used, in, cmyk, systems, to, augment, c, m, and, y, inks, or, dyes, this, is, more, efficient, in, terms, of, time, and, expense, and, less, likely, to, introduce, visible, defects, before, the, color, names, cyan, and, magenta, were, in, common, use, these, primaries, were, often, known, as, blue, and, red, respectively, and, their, exact, color, has, changed, over, time, with, access, to, new, pigments, and, technologies, organizations, such, as, fogra, european, color, initiative, and, swop, publish, colorimetric, cmyk, standards, for, the, printing, industry, color, theorists, since, the, seventeenth, century, and, many, artists, and, designers, since, that, time, have, taken, red, yellow, and, blue, to, be, the, primary, colors, see, history, below, this, ryb, system, in, traditional, color, theory, is, often, used, to, order, and, compare, colors, and, sometimes, proposed, as, a, system, of, mixing, pigments, to, get, a, wide, range, of, or, all, colors, o, connor, describes, the, role, of, ryb, primaries, in, traditional, color, theory, a, cornerstone, component, of, traditional, color, theory, the, ryb, conceptual, color, model, underpins, the, notion, that, the, creation, of, an, exhaustive, gamut, of, color, nuances, occurs, via, intermixture, of, red, yellow, and, blue, pigments, especially, when, applied, in, conjunction, with, white, and, black, pigment, color, in, the, literature, relating, to, traditional, color, theory, and, ryb, color, red, yellow, and, blue, are, often, referred, to, as, primary, colors, and, represent, exemplar, hues, rather, than, specific, hues, that, are, more, pure, unique, or, proprietary, variants, of, these, hues, traditional, color, theory, is, based, on, experience, with, pigments, more, than, on, the, science, of, light, in, 1920, snow, and, froehlich, explained, it, does, not, matter, to, the, makers, of, dyes, if, as, the, physicist, says, red, light, and, green, light, in, mixture, make, yellow, light, when, they, find, by, experiment, that, red, pigment, and, green, pigment, in, mixture, produce, gray, no, matter, what, the, spectroscope, may, demonstrate, regarding, the, combination, of, yellow, rays, of, light, and, blue, rays, of, light, the, fact, remains, that, yellow, pigment, mixed, with, the, blue, pigment, produces, green, pigment, the, widespread, adoption, of, teaching, of, ryb, as, primary, colors, in, post, secondary, art, schools, in, the, twentieth, century, has, been, attributed, to, the, influence, of, the, bauhaus, where, johannes, itten, developed, his, ideas, on, color, during, his, time, there, in, the, 1920s, and, of, his, book, on, color, published, in, 1961, in, discussing, color, design, for, the, web, jason, beaird, writes, the, reason, many, digital, artists, still, keep, a, red, yellow, and, blue, color, wheel, handy, is, because, the, color, schemes, and, concepts, of, traditional, color, theory, are, based, on, that, model, even, though, i, design, mostly, for, the, web, a, medium, that, s, displayed, in, rgb, i, still, use, red, yellow, and, blue, as, the, basis, for, my, color, selection, i, believe, that, color, combinations, created, using, the, red, yellow, and, blue, color, wheel, are, more, aesthetically, pleasing, and, that, good, design, is, about, aesthetics, of, course, the, notion, that, all, colors, can, be, mixed, from, ryb, primaries, is, not, true, just, as, it, is, not, true, in, any, system, of, real, primaries, for, example, if, the, blue, pigment, is, a, deep, prussian, blue, then, a, muddy, desaturated, green, may, be, the, best, that, can, be, had, by, mixing, with, yellow, to, achieve, a, larger, gamut, of, colors, via, mixing, the, blue, and, red, pigments, used, in, illustrative, materials, such, as, the, color, mixing, guide, in, the, image, are, often, closer, to, peacock, blue, a, blue, green, or, cyan, and, carmine, or, crimson, or, magenta, respectively, printers, traditionally, used, inks, of, such, colors, known, as, process, blue, and, process, red, before, modern, color, science, and, the, printing, industry, converged, on, the, process, colors, and, names, cyan, and, magenta, this, is, not, to, say, that, ryb, is, the, same, as, cmy, or, that, it, is, exactly, subtractive, but, that, there, is, a, range, of, ways, to, conceptualize, traditional, ryb, as, a, subtractive, system, in, the, framework, of, modern, color, science, faber, castell, identifies, the, following, three, colors, cadmium, yellow, number, 107, for, yellow, phthalo, blue, number, 110, for, blue, and, deep, scarlet, red, number, 219, for, red, as, the, closest, to, primary, colors, for, its, art, graphic, color, pencils, range, cadmium, yellow, number, 107, for, yellow, phthalo, blue, number, 110, for, blue, and, pale, geranium, lake, number, 121, for, red, are, provided, as, primary, colors, in, its, basic, 5, color, albrecht, d, rer, watercolor, marker, set, the, first, known, use, of, red, yellow, and, blue, as, simple, or, primary, colors, by, chalcidius, ca, ad, 300, was, possibly, based, on, the, art, of, paint, mixing, mixing, pigments, for, the, purpose, of, creating, realistic, paintings, with, diverse, color, gamuts, is, known, to, have, been, practiced, at, least, since, ancient, greece, see, history, section, the, identity, of, a, the, set, of, minimal, pigments, to, mix, diverse, gamuts, has, long, been, the, subject, of, speculation, by, theorists, whose, claims, have, changed, over, time, for, example, pliny, s, white, black, one, or, another, red, and, sil, which, might, have, been, yellow, or, blue, robert, boyle, s, white, black, red, yellow, and, blue, and, variations, with, more, or, fewer, primary, color, or, pigments, some, writers, and, artists, have, found, these, schemes, difficult, to, reconcile, with, the, actual, practice, of, painting, 29, 38, nonetheless, it, has, long, been, known, that, limited, palettes, consisting, of, a, small, set, of, pigments, are, sufficient, to, mix, a, diverse, gamut, of, colors, the, set, of, pigments, available, to, mix, diverse, gamuts, of, color, in, various, media, such, as, oil, watercolor, acrylic, gouache, and, pastel, is, large, and, has, changed, throughout, history, there, is, no, consensus, on, a, specific, set, of, pigments, that, are, considered, primary, colors, the, choice, of, pigments, depends, entirely, on, the, artist, s, subjective, preference, of, subject, and, style, of, art, as, well, as, material, considerations, like, lightfastness, and, mixing, behavior, a, variety, of, limited, palettes, have, been, employed, by, artists, for, their, work, the, color, of, light, i, e, the, spectral, power, distribution, reflected, from, illuminated, surfaces, coated, in, paint, mixes, is, not, well, approximated, by, a, subtractive, or, additive, mixing, model, color, predictions, that, incorporate, light, scattering, effects, of, pigment, particles, and, paint, layer, thickness, require, approaches, based, on, the, kubelka, munk, equations, but, even, such, approaches, are, not, expected, to, predict, the, color, of, paint, mixtures, precisely, due, to, inherent, limitations, artists, typically, rely, on, mixing, experience, and, recipes, to, mix, desired, colors, from, a, small, initial, set, of, primaries, and, do, not, use, mathematical, modeling, macevoy, explains, why, artists, often, chose, a, palette, closer, to, ryb, than, to, cmy, because, the, optimal, pigments, in, practice, produce, unsatisfactory, mixtures, because, the, alternative, selections, are, less, granulating, more, transparent, and, mix, darker, values, and, because, visual, preferences, have, demanded, relatively, saturated, yellow, to, red, mixtures, obtained, at, the, expense, of, relatively, dull, green, and, purple, mixtures, artists, jettisoned, theory, to, obtain, the, best, color, mixtures, in, practice, a, color, space, is, a, subset, of, a, color, model, where, the, primaries, have, been, defined, either, directly, as, photometric, spectra, or, indirectly, as, a, function, of, other, color, spaces, for, example, srgb, and, adobe, rgb, are, both, color, spaces, based, on, the, rgb, color, model, however, the, green, primary, of, adobe, rgb, is, more, saturated, than, the, equivalent, in, srgb, and, therefore, yields, a, larger, gamut, otherwise, choice, of, color, space, is, largely, arbitrary, and, depends, on, the, utility, to, a, specific, application, color, space, primaries, are, derived, from, canonical, colorimetric, experiments, that, represent, a, standardized, model, of, an, observer, i, e, a, set, of, color, matching, functions, adopted, by, commission, internationale, de, l, eclairage, cie, standards, the, abbreviated, account, of, color, space, primaries, in, this, section, is, based, on, descriptions, in, colorimetry, understanding, the, cie, system, the, cie, 1931, standard, observer, is, derived, from, experiments, in, which, participants, observe, a, foveal, secondary, bipartite, field, with, a, dark, surround, half, of, the, field, is, illuminated, with, a, monochromatic, test, stimulus, ranging, from, 380, nm, to, 780, nm, and, the, other, half, is, the, matching, stimulus, illuminated, with, three, coincident, monochromatic, primary, lights, 700, nm, for, red, r, 546, 1, nm, for, green, g, and, 435, 8, nm, for, blue, b, 29, these, primaries, correspond, to, cie, rgb, color, space, the, intensities, of, the, primary, lights, could, be, adjusted, by, the, participant, observer, until, the, matching, stimulus, matched, the, test, stimulus, as, predicted, by, grassman, s, laws, of, additive, mixing, different, standard, observers, from, other, color, matching, experiments, have, been, derived, since, 1931, the, variations, in, experiments, include, choices, of, primary, lights, field, of, view, number, of, participants, etc, but, the, presentation, below, is, representative, of, those, results, matching, was, performed, across, many, participants, in, incremental, steps, along, the, range, of, test, stimulus, wavelengths, 380, nm, to, 780, nm, to, ultimately, yield, the, color, matching, functions, r, displaystyle, overline, r, lambda, g, displaystyle, overline, g, lambda, and, b, displaystyle, overline, b, lambda, that, represent, the, relative, intensities, of, red, green, and, blue, light, to, match, each, wavelength, displaystyle, lambda, these, functions, imply, that, c, displaystyle, units, of, the, test, stimulus, with, any, spectral, power, distribution, p, displaystyle, p, lambda, can, be, matched, by, and, units, of, each, primary, where, 28, each, integral, term, in, the, above, equation, is, known, as, a, tristimulus, value, and, measures, amounts, in, the, adopted, units, no, set, of, real, primary, lights, can, match, another, monochromatic, light, under, additive, mixing, so, at, least, one, of, the, color, matching, functions, is, negative, for, each, wavelength, a, negative, tristimulus, value, corresponds, to, that, primary, being, added, to, the, test, stimulus, instead, of, the, matching, stimulus, to, achieve, a, match, the, negative, tristimulus, values, made, certain, types, of, calculations, difficult, so, the, cie, put, forth, new, color, matching, functions, x, displaystyle, overline, x, lambda, y, displaystyle, overline, y, lambda, and, z, displaystyle, overline, z, lambda, defined, by, the, following, linear, transformation, 30, these, new, color, matching, functions, correspond, to, imaginary, primary, lights, x, y, and, z, cie, xyz, color, space, all, colors, can, be, matched, by, finding, the, amounts, and, analogously, to, and, as, defined, in, eq, 1, the, functions, x, displaystyle, overline, x, lambda, y, displaystyle, overline, y, lambda, and, z, displaystyle, overline, z, lambda, based, on, the, specifications, that, they, should, be, nonnegative, for, all, wavelengths, y, displaystyle, overline, y, lambda, be, equal, to, photometric, luminance, and, that, x, y, z, displaystyle, for, an, equienergy, i, e, a, uniform, spectral, power, distribution, test, stimulus, 30, derivations, use, the, color, matching, functions, along, with, data, from, other, experiments, to, ultimately, yield, the, cone, fundamentals, l, displaystyle, overline, l, lambda, m, displaystyle, overline, m, lambda, and, s, displaystyle, overline, s, lambda, these, functions, correspond, to, the, response, curves, for, the, three, types, of, color, photoreceptors, found, in, the, human, retina, long, wavelength, l, medium, wavelength, m, and, short, wavelength, s, cones, the, three, cone, fundamentals, are, related, to, the, original, color, matching, functions, by, the, following, linear, transformation, specific, to, a, 10, field, 227, lms, color, space, comprises, three, primary, lights, l, m, and, s, that, stimulate, only, the, l, m, and, s, cones, respectively, a, real, primary, that, stimulates, only, the, m, cone, is, impossible, and, therefore, these, primaries, are, imaginary, the, lms, color, space, has, significant, physiological, relevance, as, these, three, photoreceptors, mediate, trichromatic, color, vision, in, humans, both, xyz, and, lms, color, spaces, are, complete, since, all, colors, in, the, gamut, of, the, standard, observer, are, contained, within, their, color, spaces, complete, color, spaces, must, have, imaginary, primaries, but, color, spaces, with, imaginary, primaries, are, not, necessarily, complete, e, g, prophoto, rgb, color, space, color, spaces, used, in, color, reproduction, must, use, real, primaries, that, can, be, reproduced, by, practical, sources, either, lights, in, additive, models, or, pigments, in, subtractive, models, most, rgb, color, spaces, have, real, primaries, though, some, maintain, imaginary, primaries, for, example, all, the, srgb, primaries, fall, within, the, gamut, of, human, perception, and, so, can, be, easily, represented, by, practical, light, sources, including, crt, and, led, displays, hence, why, srgb, is, still, the, color, space, of, choice, for, digital, displays, a, color, in, a, color, space, is, defined, as, a, combination, of, its, primaries, where, each, primary, must, give, a, non, negative, contribution, any, color, space, based, on, a, finite, number, of, real, primaries, is, incomplete, in, that, it, cannot, reproduce, every, color, within, the, gamut, of, the, standard, observer, practical, color, spaces, such, as, srgb, and, scrgb, are, typically, at, least, partially, defined, in, terms, of, linear, transformations, from, cie, xyz, and, color, management, often, uses, cie, xyz, as, a, middle, point, for, transformations, between, two, other, color, spaces, most, color, spaces, in, the, color, matching, context, those, defined, by, their, relationship, to, cie, xyz, inherit, its, three, dimensionality, however, more, complex, color, appearance, models, like, ciecam02, require, extra, dimensions, to, describe, colors, appear, under, different, viewing, conditions, the, opponent, process, was, proposed, by, ewald, hering, in, which, he, described, the, four, unique, hues, later, called, psychological, primaries, in, some, contexts, red, green, yellow, and, blue, to, hering, the, unique, hues, appeared, as, pure, colors, while, all, others, were, psychological, mixes, of, two, of, them, furthermore, these, colors, were, organized, in, opponent, pairs, red, vs, green, and, yellow, vs, blue, so, that, mixing, could, occur, across, pairs, e, g, a, yellowish, green, or, a, yellowish, red, but, not, within, a, pair, i, e, reddish, green, cannot, be, imagined, an, achromatic, opponent, process, along, black, and, white, is, also, part, of, hering, s, explanation, of, color, perception, hering, asserted, that, we, did, not, know, why, these, color, relationships, were, true, but, knew, that, they, were, although, there, is, a, great, deal, of, evidence, for, the, opponent, process, in, the, form, of, neural, mechanisms, there, is, currently, no, clear, mapping, of, the, psychological, primaries, to, neural, correlates, the, psychological, primaries, were, applied, by, richard, s, hunter, as, the, primaries, for, hunter, l, a, b, colorspace, that, led, to, the, creation, of, cielab, the, natural, color, system, is, also, directly, inspired, by, the, psychological, primaries, philosophical, writing, from, ancient, greece, has, described, notions, of, primary, colors, but, they, can, be, difficult, to, interpret, in, terms, of, modern, color, science, theophrastus, c, 371, 287, bce, described, democritus, position, that, the, primary, colors, were, white, black, red, and, green, 4, in, classical, greece, empedocles, identified, white, black, red, and, depending, on, the, interpretation, either, yellow, or, green, as, primary, colors, 8, aristotle, described, a, notion, in, which, white, and, black, could, be, mixed, in, different, ratios, to, yield, chromatic, colors, 12, this, idea, had, considerable, influence, in, western, thinking, about, color, fran, ois, d, aguilon, s, notion, of, the, five, primary, colors, white, yellow, red, blue, black, was, influenced, by, aristotle, s, idea, of, the, chromatic, colors, being, made, of, black, and, white, 87, the, 20th, century, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, explored, color, related, ideas, using, red, green, blue, and, yellow, as, primary, colors, isaac, newton, used, the, term, primary, color, to, describe, the, colored, spectral, components, of, sunlight, a, number, of, color, theorists, did, not, agree, with, newton, s, work, david, brewster, advocated, that, red, yellow, and, blue, light, could, be, combined, into, any, spectral, hue, late, into, the, 1840s, thomas, young, proposed, red, green, and, violet, as, the, three, primary, colors, while, james, clerk, maxwell, favored, changing, violet, to, blue, hermann, von, helmholtz, proposed, a, slightly, purplish, red, a, vegetation, green, slightly, yellowish, and, an, ultramarine, blue, as, a, trio, newton, young, maxwell, and, helmholtz, were, all, prominent, contributors, to, modern, color, science, 1, 39, that, ultimately, described, the, perception, of, color, in, terms, of, the, three, types, of, retinal, photoreceptors, john, gage, s, the, fortunes, of, apelles, provides, a, summary, of, the, history, of, primary, colors, as, pigments, in, painting, and, describes, the, evolution, of, the, idea, as, complex, gage, begins, by, describing, pliny, the, elder, s, account, of, notable, greek, painters, who, used, four, primaries, pliny, distinguished, the, pigments, i, e, substances, from, their, apparent, colors, white, from, milos, ex, albis, red, from, sinope, ex, rubris, attic, yellow, sil, and, atramentum, ex, nigris, sil, was, historically, confused, as, a, blue, pigment, between, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, leading, to, claims, about, white, black, red, and, blue, being, the, fewest, colors, required, for, painting, thomas, bardwell, an, 18th, century, norwich, portrait, painter, was, skeptical, of, the, practical, relevance, of, pliny, s, account, robert, boyle, the, irish, chemist, introduced, the, term, primary, color, in, english, in, 1664, and, claimed, that, there, were, five, primary, colors, white, black, red, yellow, and, blue, the, german, painter, joachim, von, sandrart, eventually, proposed, removing, white, and, black, from, the, primaries, and, that, one, only, needed, red, yellow, blue, and, green, to, paint, the, whole, creation, 36, red, yellow, and, blue, as, primaries, became, a, popular, notion, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, jacob, christoph, le, blon, an, engraver, was, the, first, to, use, separate, plates, for, each, color, in, mezzotint, printmaking, yellow, red, and, blue, plus, black, to, add, shades, and, contrast, le, blon, used, primitive, in, 1725, to, describe, red, yellow, and, blue, in, a, very, similar, sense, as, boyle, used, primary, 6, moses, harris, an, entomologist, and, engraver, also, describes, red, yellow, and, blue, as, primitive, colors, in, 1766, l, onor, m, rim, e, described, red, yellow, and, blue, in, his, book, on, painting, originally, published, in, french, in, 1830, as, the, three, simple, primitive, colors, that, can, make, a, great, variety, of, tones, and, colors, found, in, nature, george, field, a, chemist, used, the, word, primary, to, describe, red, yellow, and, blue, in, 1835, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, also, a, chemist, discussed, red, yellow, and, blue, as, primary, colors, in, 1839, historical, perspectives, on, color, order, systems, catalogs, of, color, that, were, proposed, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, describe, them, as, using, red, yellow, and, blue, pigments, as, chromatic, primaries, tobias, mayer, a, german, mathematician, physicist, and, astronomer, described, a, triangular, bipyramid, with, red, yellow, and, blue, at, the, 3, vertices, in, the, same, plane, white, at, the, top, vertex, and, black, and, the, bottom, vertex, in, a, public, lecture, in, 1758, 115, there, are, 11, planes, of, colors, between, the, white, and, black, vertices, inside, the, triangular, bipyramid, mayer, did, not, seem, to, distinguish, between, colored, light, and, colorant, though, he, used, vermilion, orpiment, king, s, yellow, and, bergblau, azurite, in, partially, complete, colorings, of, planes, in, his, solid, 79, johann, heinrich, lambert, a, swiss, mathematician, physicist, and, astronomer, proposed, a, triangular, pyramid, with, gamboge, carmine, and, prussian, blue, as, primaries, and, only, white, at, the, top, vertex, since, lambert, could, produce, a, mixture, that, was, sufficiently, black, with, those, pigments, 123, lambert, s, work, on, this, system, was, published, in, 1772, philipp, otto, runge, the, romantic, german, painter, firmly, believed, in, the, theory, of, red, yellow, and, blue, as, the, primary, colors, 87, again, without, distinguishing, light, color, and, colorant, his, color, sphere, was, ultimately, described, in, an, essay, titled, farben, kugel, color, ball, published, by, goethe, in, 1810, 84, his, spherical, model, of, colors, equally, spaced, red, yellow, and, blue, longitudinally, with, orange, green, and, violet, between, them, and, white, and, black, at, opposite, poles, 85, numerous, authors, have, taught, that, red, yellow, and, blue, ryb, are, the, primary, colors, in, art, education, materials, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, following, the, ideas, tabulated, above, from, earlier, centuries, a, wide, variety, of, contemporary, educational, sources, also, describe, the, ryb, primaries, these, sources, range, from, children, s, books, and, art, material, manufacturers, to, painting, and, color, guides, art, education, materials, often, suggest, that, ryb, primaries, can, be, mixed, to, create, all, other, colors, albert, munsell, an, american, painter, and, creator, of, the, munsell, color, system, referred, to, the, notion, of, ryb, primaries, as, mischief, a, widely, accepted, error, and, underspecified, in, his, book, a, color, notation, first, published, in, 1905, itten, s, ideas, about, ryb, primaries, have, been, criticized, as, ignoring, modern, color, science, 282, with, demonstrations, that, some, of, itten, s, claims, about, mixing, ryb, primaries, are, impossible
