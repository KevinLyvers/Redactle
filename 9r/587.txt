petrology, from, ancient, greek, p, tros, rock, and, log, a, study, of, is, the, branch, of, geology, that, studies, rocks, their, mineralogy, composition, texture, structure, and, the, conditions, under, which, they, form, petrology, has, three, subdivisions, igneous, metamorphic, and, sedimentary, petrology, igneous, and, metamorphic, petrology, are, commonly, taught, together, because, both, make, heavy, use, of, chemistry, chemical, methods, and, phase, diagrams, sedimentary, petrology, is, commonly, taught, together, with, stratigraphy, because, it, deals, with, the, processes, that, form, sedimentary, rock, modern, sedimentary, petrology, is, making, increasing, use, of, chemistry, lithology, was, once, approximately, synonymous, with, petrography, but, in, current, usage, lithology, focuses, on, macroscopic, hand, sample, or, outcrop, scale, description, of, rocks, while, petrography, is, the, speciality, that, deals, with, microscopic, details, in, the, petroleum, industry, lithology, or, more, specifically, mud, logging, is, the, graphic, representation, of, geological, formations, being, drilled, through, and, drawn, on, a, log, called, a, mud, log, as, the, cuttings, are, circulated, out, of, the, borehole, they, are, sampled, examined, typically, under, a, 10, microscope, and, tested, chemically, when, needed, petrology, utilizes, the, fields, of, mineralogy, petrography, optical, mineralogy, and, chemical, analysis, to, describe, the, composition, and, texture, of, rocks, petrologists, also, include, the, principles, of, geochemistry, and, geophysics, through, the, study, of, geochemical, trends, and, cycles, and, the, use, of, thermodynamic, data, and, experiments, in, order, to, better, understand, the, origins, of, rocks, there, are, three, branches, of, petrology, corresponding, to, the, three, types, of, rocks, igneous, metamorphic, and, sedimentary, and, another, dealing, with, experimental, techniques
