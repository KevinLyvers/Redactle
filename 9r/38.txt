the, hectare, h, k, t, r, t, r, si, symbol, ha, is, a, non, si, metric, unit, of, area, equal, to, a, square, with, 100, metre, sides, 1, hm, 2, that, is, 10, 000, square, metres, 10, 000, m, 2, and, is, primarily, used, in, the, measurement, of, land, there, are, 100, hectares, in, one, square, kilometre, an, acre, is, about, 0, 405, hectares, and, one, hectare, contains, about, 2, 47, acres, in, 1795, when, the, metric, system, was, introduced, the, are, was, defined, as, 100, square, metres, or, one, square, decametre, and, the, hectare, hecto, are, was, thus, 100, ares, or, 1, 100, km, 2, 10, 000, square, metres, when, the, metric, system, was, further, rationalised, in, 1960, resulting, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, are, was, not, included, as, a, recognised, unit, the, hectare, however, remains, as, a, non, si, unit, accepted, for, use, with, the, si, and, whose, use, is, expected, to, continue, indefinitely, though, the, dekare, decare, daa, 1, 000, m, 2, and, are, 100, m, 2, are, not, officially, accepted, for, use, they, are, still, used, in, some, contexts, the, hectare, h, k, t, r, t, r, although, not, a, unit, of, si, is, the, only, named, unit, of, area, that, is, accepted, for, use, with, si, units, the, name, was, coined, in, french, from, the, latin, rea, in, practice, the, hectare, is, fully, derived, from, the, si, being, equivalent, to, a, square, hectometre, it, is, widely, used, throughout, the, world, for, the, measurement, of, large, areas, of, land, and, it, is, the, legal, unit, of, measure, in, domains, concerned, with, land, ownership, planning, and, management, including, law, land, deeds, agriculture, forestry, and, town, planning, throughout, the, european, union, new, zealand, and, australia, since, 1970, however, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, myanmar, burma, and, to, some, extent, canada, use, the, acre, instead, of, the, hectare, for, measuring, surface, or, land, area, some, countries, that, underwent, a, general, conversion, from, traditional, measurements, to, metric, measurements, e, g, canada, required, a, resurvey, when, units, of, measure, in, legal, descriptions, relating, to, land, were, converted, to, metric, units, others, such, as, south, africa, published, conversion, factors, which, were, to, be, used, particularly, when, preparing, consolidation, diagrams, by, compilation, in, many, countries, metrification, redefined, or, clarified, existing, measures, in, terms, of, metric, units, the, following, legacy, units, of, area, have, been, redefined, as, being, equal, to, one, hectare, in, mexico, land, area, measurements, are, commonly, given, as, combinations, of, hectares, ares, and, centiares, these, are, commonly, written, separated, by, a, dash, for, example, 1, 21, 00, 26, ha, would, mean, 1, hectare, 21, ares, and, 0, 26, centiares, 12, 100, 26, m, 2, the, metric, system, of, measurement, was, first, given, a, legal, basis, in, 1795, by, the, french, revolutionary, government, the, law, of, 18, germinal, year, iii, 7, april, 1795, defined, five, units, of, measure, in, 1960, when, the, metric, system, was, updated, as, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, are, did, not, receive, international, recognition, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, makes, no, mention, of, the, are, in, the, 2019, edition, of, the, si, brochure, but, classifies, the, hectare, as, a, non, si, unit, accepted, for, use, with, the, international, system, of, units, in, 1972, the, european, economic, community, eec, passed, directive, 71, 354, eec, which, catalogued, the, units, of, measure, that, might, be, used, within, the, community, the, units, that, were, catalogued, replicated, the, recommendations, of, the, cgpm, supplemented, by, a, few, other, units, including, the, are, and, implicitly, the, hectare, whose, use, was, limited, to, the, measurement, of, land, the, names, centiare, deciare, decare, and, hectare, are, derived, by, adding, the, standard, metric, prefixes, to, the, original, base, unit, of, area, the, are, the, decimilliare, dma, sometimes, seen, in, cadastre, area, evaluation, of, real, estate, plots, is, 1, 10, 000, are, or, one, square, decimetre, such, usage, of, a, double, prefix, is, non, standard, the, decimilliare, is, 100, mm, 2, or, roughly, a, four, inch, by, four, inch, square, the, centiare, is, one, square, metre, the, deciare, rarely, used, is, ten, square, metres, the, are, r, or, r, is, a, unit, of, area, equal, to, 100, square, metres, 10, m, 10, m, used, for, measuring, land, area, it, was, defined, by, older, forms, of, the, metric, system, but, is, now, outside, the, modern, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, still, commonly, used, in, speech, to, measure, real, estate, in, particular, in, indonesia, india, and, in, various, european, countries, in, russian, and, some, other, languages, of, the, former, soviet, union, the, are, is, called, sotka, russian, a, hundred, i, e, 100, m, 2, or, 1, 100, hectare, it, is, used, to, describe, the, size, of, suburban, dacha, or, allotment, garden, plots, or, small, city, parks, where, the, hectare, would, be, too, large, many, russian, dachas, are, 6, ares, in, size, in, russian, the, decare, or, dekare, d, k, r, r, is, derived, from, deca, and, are, and, is, equal, to, 10, ares, or, 1000, square, metres, it, is, used, in, norway, and, in, the, former, ottoman, areas, of, the, middle, east, and, bulgaria, as, a, measure, of, land, area, the, names, of, the, older, land, measures, of, similar, size, are, usually, used, redefined, as, exactly, one, decare, the, most, commonly, used, units, are, in, bold, one, hectare, is, also, equivalent, to, the, unicode, character, u, 33ca, square, ha, in, the, cjk, compatibility, block, is, intended, for, compatibility, with, pre, existing, east, asian, character, codes, it, is, not,
