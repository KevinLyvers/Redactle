indium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, in, and, atomic, number, 49, it, is, a, silvery, white, post, transition, metal, and, one, of, the, softest, elements, chemically, indium, is, similar, to, gallium, and, thallium, and, its, properties, are, largely, intermediate, between, the, two, it, was, discovered, in, 1863, by, ferdinand, reich, and, hieronymous, theodor, richter, by, spectroscopic, methods, and, named, for, the, indigo, blue, line, in, its, spectrum, indium, is, a, technology, critical, element, used, primarily, in, the, production, of, flat, panel, displays, as, indium, tin, oxide, ito, a, transparent, and, conductive, coating, applied, to, glass, indium, is, also, used, in, the, semiconductor, industry, in, low, melting, point, metal, alloys, such, as, solders, and, soft, metal, high, vacuum, seals, it, is, produced, exclusively, as, a, by, product, during, the, processing, of, the, ores, of, other, metals, chiefly, from, sphalerite, and, other, zinc, sulfide, ores, indium, has, no, biological, role, and, its, compounds, are, toxic, when, inhaled, or, injected, into, the, bloodstream, although, they, are, poorly, absorbed, following, ingestion, the, name, comes, from, the, latin, word, indicum, meaning, violet, or, indigo, indium, is, a, shiny, silvery, white, highly, ductile, post, transition, metal, with, a, bright, luster, it, is, so, soft, mohs, hardness, 1, 2, that, it, can, be, cut, with, a, knife, and, leaves, a, visible, line, like, a, pencil, when, rubbed, on, paper, it, is, a, member, of, group, 13, on, the, periodic, table, and, its, properties, are, mostly, intermediate, between, its, vertical, neighbors, gallium, and, thallium, like, tin, a, high, pitched, cry, is, heard, when, indium, is, bent, a, crackling, sound, due, to, crystal, twinning, like, gallium, indium, is, able, to, wet, glass, like, both, indium, has, a, low, melting, point, 156, 60, c, 313, 88, f, higher, than, its, lighter, homologue, gallium, but, lower, than, its, heavier, homologue, thallium, and, lower, than, tin, the, boiling, point, is, 2072, c, 3762, f, higher, than, that, of, thallium, but, lower, than, gallium, conversely, to, the, general, trend, of, melting, points, but, similarly, to, the, trends, down, the, other, post, transition, metal, groups, because, of, the, weakness, of, the, metallic, bonding, with, few, electrons, delocalized, the, density, of, indium, 7, 31, g, cm, 3, is, also, greater, than, gallium, but, lower, than, thallium, below, the, critical, temperature, 3, 41, k, indium, becomes, a, superconductor, indium, crystallizes, in, the, body, centered, tetragonal, crystal, system, in, the, space, group, i, 4, mmm, lattice, parameters, a, 325, pm, c, 495, pm, this, is, a, slightly, distorted, face, centered, cubic, structure, where, each, indium, atom, has, four, neighbours, at, 324, pm, distance, and, eight, neighbours, slightly, further, 336, pm, indium, has, greater, solubility, in, liquid, mercury, than, any, other, metal, more, than, 50, mass, percent, of, indium, at, 0, c, indium, displays, a, ductile, viscoplastic, response, found, to, be, size, independent, in, tension, and, compression, however, it, does, have, a, size, effect, in, bending, and, indentation, associated, to, a, length, scale, of, order, 50, 100, m, significantly, large, when, compared, with, other, metals, indium, has, 49, electrons, with, an, electronic, configuration, of, 4d, 10, 5s, 2, 5p, 1, in, compounds, indium, most, commonly, donates, the, three, outermost, electrons, to, become, indium, iii, in, 3, in, some, cases, the, pair, of, 5s, electrons, are, not, donated, resulting, in, indium, i, in, the, stabilization, of, the, monovalent, state, is, attributed, to, the, inert, pair, effect, in, which, relativistic, effects, stabilize, the, 5s, orbital, observed, in, heavier, elements, thallium, indium, s, heavier, homolog, shows, an, even, stronger, effect, causing, oxidation, to, thallium, i, to, be, more, probable, than, to, thallium, iii, whereas, gallium, indium, s, lighter, homolog, commonly, shows, only, the, 3, oxidation, state, thus, although, thallium, iii, is, a, moderately, strong, oxidizing, agent, indium, iii, is, not, and, many, indium, i, compounds, are, powerful, reducing, agents, while, the, energy, required, to, include, the, s, electrons, in, chemical, bonding, is, lowest, for, indium, among, the, group, 13, metals, bond, energies, decrease, down, the, group, so, that, by, indium, the, energy, released, in, forming, two, additional, bonds, and, attaining, the, 3, state, is, not, always, enough, to, outweigh, the, energy, needed, to, involve, the, 5s, electrons, indium, i, oxide, and, hydroxide, are, more, basic, and, indium, iii, oxide, and, hydroxide, are, more, acidic, a, number, of, standard, electrode, potentials, depending, on, the, reaction, under, study, are, reported, for, indium, reflecting, the, decreased, stability, of, the, 3, oxidation, state, indium, metal, does, not, react, with, water, but, it, is, oxidized, by, stronger, oxidizing, agents, such, as, halogens, to, give, indium, iii, compounds, it, does, not, form, a, boride, silicide, or, carbide, and, the, hydride, inh, 3, has, at, best, a, transitory, existence, in, ethereal, solutions, at, low, temperatures, being, unstable, enough, to, spontaneously, polymerize, without, coordination, indium, is, rather, basic, in, aqueous, solution, showing, only, slight, amphoteric, characteristics, and, unlike, its, lighter, homologs, aluminium, and, gallium, it, is, insoluble, in, aqueous, alkaline, solutions, indium, has, 39, known, isotopes, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 97, to, 135, only, two, isotopes, occur, naturally, as, primordial, nuclides, indium, 113, the, only, stable, isotope, and, indium, 115, which, has, a, half, life, of, 4, 41, 10, 14, years, four, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, age, of, the, universe, and, nearly, 30, 000, times, greater, than, half, life, of, thorium, 232, the, half, life, of, 115, in, is, very, long, because, the, beta, decay, to, 115, sn, is, spin, forbidden, indium, 115, makes, up, 95, 7, of, all, indium, indium, is, one, of, three, known, elements, the, others, being, tellurium, and, rhenium, of, which, the, stable, isotope, is, less, abundant, in, nature, than, the, long, lived, primordial, radioisotopes, the, stablest, artificial, isotope, is, indium, 111, with, a, half, life, of, approximately, 2, 8, days, all, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, shorter, than, 5, hours, indium, also, has, 47, meta, states, among, which, indium, 114m1, half, life, about, 49, 51, days, is, the, most, stable, more, stable, than, the, ground, state, of, any, indium, isotope, other, than, the, primordial, all, decay, by, isomeric, transition, the, indium, isotopes, lighter, than, 113, in, predominantly, decay, through, electron, capture, or, positron, emission, to, form, cadmium, isotopes, while, the, indium, isotopes, heavier, than, 113, in, predominantly, decay, through, beta, minus, decay, to, form, tin, isotopes, indium, iii, oxide, in, 2, o, 3, forms, when, indium, metal, is, burned, in, air, or, when, the, hydroxide, or, nitrate, is, heated, in, 2, o, 3, adopts, a, structure, like, alumina, and, is, amphoteric, that, is, able, to, react, with, both, acids, and, bases, indium, reacts, with, water, to, reproduce, soluble, indium, iii, hydroxide, which, is, also, amphoteric, with, alkalis, to, produce, indates, iii, and, with, acids, to, produce, indium, iii, salts, the, analogous, sesqui, chalcogenides, with, sulfur, selenium, and, tellurium, are, also, known, indium, forms, the, expected, trihalides, chlorination, bromination, and, iodination, of, in, produce, colorless, incl, 3, inbr, 3, and, yellow, ini, 3, the, compounds, are, lewis, acids, somewhat, akin, to, the, better, known, aluminium, trihalides, again, like, the, related, aluminium, compound, inf, 3, is, polymeric, direct, reaction, of, indium, with, the, pnictogens, produces, the, gray, or, semimetallic, iii, v, semiconductors, many, of, them, slowly, decompose, in, moist, air, necessitating, careful, storage, of, semiconductor, compounds, to, prevent, contact, with, the, atmosphere, indium, nitride, is, readily, attacked, by, acids, and, alkalis, indium, i, compounds, are, not, common, the, chloride, bromide, and, iodide, are, deeply, colored, unlike, the, parent, trihalides, from, which, they, are, prepared, the, fluoride, is, known, only, as, an, unstable, gas, indium, i, oxide, black, powder, is, produced, when, indium, iii, oxide, decomposes, upon, heating, to, 700, c, less, frequently, indium, forms, compounds, in, oxidation, state, 2, and, even, fractional, oxidation, states, usually, such, materials, feature, in, in, bonding, most, notably, in, the, halides, in, 2, x, 4, and, 2, and, various, subchalcogenides, such, as, in, 4, se, 3, several, other, compounds, are, known, to, combine, indium, i, and, indium, iii, such, as, in, i, 6, in, iii, cl, 6, cl, 3, in, i, 5, in, iii, br, 4, 2, in, iii, br, 6, and, in, i, in, iii, br, 4, organoindium, compounds, feature, in, c, bonds, most, are, in, iii, derivatives, but, cyclopentadienylindium, i, is, an, exception, it, was, the, first, known, organoindium, i, compound, and, is, polymeric, consisting, of, zigzag, chains, of, alternating, indium, atoms, and, cyclopentadienyl, complexes, perhaps, the, best, known, organoindium, compound, is, trimethylindium, in, ch, 3, 3, used, to, prepare, certain, semiconducting, materials, in, 1863, german, chemists, ferdinand, reich, and, hieronymous, theodor, richter, were, testing, ores, from, the, mines, around, freiberg, saxony, they, dissolved, the, minerals, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, and, sphalerite, in, hydrochloric, acid, and, distilled, raw, zinc, chloride, reich, who, was, color, blind, employed, richter, as, an, assistant, for, detecting, the, colored, spectral, lines, knowing, that, ores, from, that, region, sometimes, contain, thallium, they, searched, for, the, green, thallium, emission, spectrum, lines, instead, they, found, a, bright, blue, line, because, that, blue, line, did, not, match, any, known, element, they, hypothesized, a, new, element, was, present, in, the, minerals, they, named, the, element, indium, from, the, indigo, color, seen, in, its, spectrum, after, the, latin, indicum, meaning, of, india, richter, went, on, to, isolate, the, metal, in, 1864, an, ingot, of, 0, 5, kg, 1, 1, lb, was, presented, at, the, world, fair, 1867, reich, and, richter, later, fell, out, when, the, latter, claimed, to, be, the, sole, discoverer, indium, is, created, by, the, long, lasting, up, to, thousands, of, years, s, process, slow, neutron, capture, in, low, to, medium, mass, stars, range, in, mass, between, 0, 6, and, 10, solar, masses, when, a, silver, 109, atom, captures, a, neutron, it, transmutes, into, silver, 110, which, then, undergoes, beta, decay, to, become, cadmium, 110, capturing, further, neutrons, it, becomes, cadmium, 115, which, decays, to, indium, 115, by, another, beta, decay, this, explains, why, the, radioactive, isotope, is, more, abundant, than, the, stable, one, the, stable, indium, isotope, indium, 113, is, one, of, the, p, nuclei, the, origin, of, which, is, not, fully, understood, although, indium, 113, is, known, to, be, made, directly, in, the, s, and, r, processes, rapid, neutron, capture, and, also, as, the, daughter, of, very, long, lived, cadmium, 113, which, has, a, half, life, of, about, eight, quadrillion, years, this, cannot, account, for, all, indium, 113, indium, is, the, 68th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, at, approximately, 50, ppb, this, is, similar, to, the, crustal, abundance, of, silver, bismuth, and, mercury, it, very, rarely, forms, its, own, minerals, or, occurs, in, elemental, form, fewer, than, 10, indium, minerals, such, as, roquesite, cuins, 2, are, known, and, none, occur, at, sufficient, concentrations, for, economic, extraction, instead, indium, is, usually, a, trace, constituent, of, more, common, ore, minerals, such, as, sphalerite, and, chalcopyrite, from, these, it, can, be, extracted, as, a, by, product, during, smelting, while, the, enrichment, of, indium, in, these, deposits, is, high, relative, to, its, crustal, abundance, it, is, insufficient, at, current, prices, to, support, extraction, of, indium, as, the, main, product, different, estimates, exist, of, the, amounts, of, indium, contained, within, the, ores, of, other, metals, however, these, amounts, are, not, extractable, without, mining, of, the, host, materials, see, production, and, availability, thus, the, availability, of, indium, is, fundamentally, determined, by, the, rate, at, which, these, ores, are, extracted, and, not, their, absolute, amount, this, is, an, aspect, that, is, often, forgotten, in, the, current, debate, e, g, by, the, graedel, group, at, yale, in, their, criticality, assessments, explaining, the, paradoxically, low, depletion, times, some, studies, cite, indium, is, produced, exclusively, as, a, by, product, during, the, processing, of, the, ores, of, other, metals, its, main, source, material, are, sulfidic, zinc, ores, where, it, is, mostly, hosted, by, sphalerite, minor, amounts, are, also, extracted, from, sulfidic, copper, ores, during, the, roast, leach, electrowinning, process, of, zinc, smelting, indium, accumulates, in, the, iron, rich, residues, from, these, it, can, be, extracted, in, different, ways, it, may, also, be, recovered, directly, from, the, process, solutions, further, purification, is, done, by, electrolysis, the, exact, process, varies, with, the, mode, of, operation, of, the, smelter, its, by, product, status, means, that, indium, production, is, constrained, by, the, amount, of, sulfidic, zinc, and, copper, ores, extracted, each, year, therefore, its, availability, needs, to, be, discussed, in, terms, of, supply, potential, the, supply, potential, of, a, by, product, is, defined, as, that, amount, which, is, economically, extractable, from, its, host, materials, per, year, under, current, market, conditions, i, e, technology, and, price, reserves, and, resources, are, not, relevant, for, by, products, since, they, cannot, be, extracted, independently, from, the, main, products, recent, estimates, put, the, supply, potential, of, indium, at, a, minimum, of, 1, 300, t, yr, from, sulfidic, zinc, ores, and, 20, t, yr, from, sulfidic, copper, ores, these, figures, are, significantly, greater, than, current, production, 655, t, in, 2016, thus, major, future, increases, in, the, by, product, production, of, indium, will, be, possible, without, significant, increases, in, production, costs, or, price, the, average, indium, price, in, 2016, was, us, 240, kg, down, from, us, 705, kg, in, 2014, china, is, a, leading, producer, of, indium, 290, tonnes, in, 2016, followed, by, south, korea, 195, t, japan, 70, t, and, canada, 65, t, the, teck, resources, refinery, in, trail, british, columbia, is, a, large, single, source, indium, producer, with, an, output, of, 32, 5, tonnes, in, 2005, 41, 8, tonnes, in, 2004, and, 36, 1, tonnes, in, 2003, the, primary, consumption, of, indium, worldwide, is, lcd, production, demand, rose, rapidly, from, the, late, 1990s, to, 2010, with, the, popularity, of, lcd, computer, monitors, and, television, sets, which, now, account, for, 50, of, indium, consumption, increased, manufacturing, efficiency, and, recycling, especially, in, japan, maintain, a, balance, between, demand, and, supply, according, to, the, unep, indium, s, end, of, life, recycling, rate, is, less, than, 1, in, 1924, indium, was, found, to, have, a, valued, property, of, stabilizing, non, ferrous, metals, and, that, became, the, first, significant, use, for, the, element, the, first, large, scale, application, for, indium, was, coating, bearings, in, high, performance, aircraft, engines, during, world, war, ii, to, protect, against, damage, and, corrosion, this, is, no, longer, a, major, use, of, the, element, new, uses, were, found, in, fusible, alloys, solders, and, electronics, in, the, 1950s, tiny, beads, of, indium, were, used, for, the, emitters, and, collectors, of, pnp, alloy, junction, transistors, in, the, middle, and, late, 1980s, the, development, of, indium, phosphide, semiconductors, and, indium, tin, oxide, thin, films, for, liquid, crystal, displays, lcd, aroused, much, interest, by, 1992, the, thin, film, application, had, become, the, largest, end, use, indium, iii, oxide, and, indium, tin,
