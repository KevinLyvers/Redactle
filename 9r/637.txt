in, ecology, an, oasis, o, e, s, s, pl, oases, o, e, s, i, z, is, a, fertile, area, of, a, desert, or, semi, desert, environment, that, sustains, plant, life, and, provides, habitat, for, animals, surface, water, and, land, may, be, present, or, water, may, only, be, accessible, from, wells, or, underground, channels, created, by, humans, in, geography, an, oasis, may, be, a, current, or, past, rest, stop, on, a, transportation, route, or, less, than, verdant, location, that, nonetheless, provides, access, to, underground, water, through, deep, wells, created, and, maintained, by, humans, although, they, depend, on, a, natural, condition, such, as, the, presence, of, water, that, may, be, stored, in, reservoirs, and, used, for, irrigation, most, oases, as, we, know, them, are, artificial, the, word, oasis, came, into, english, from, latin, oasis, from, ancient, greek, asis, which, in, turn, is, a, direct, borrowing, from, demotic, egyptian, the, word, for, oasis, in, the, latter, attested, coptic, language, the, descendant, of, demotic, egyptian, is, wahe, or, ouahe, which, means, a, dwelling, place, oasis, in, arabic, is, w, a, arabic, oases, develop, in, hydrologically, favored, locations, that, have, attributes, such, as, a, high, water, table, seasonal, lakes, or, blockaded, wadis, oases, are, made, when, sources, of, freshwater, such, as, underground, rivers, or, aquifers, irrigate, the, surface, naturally, or, via, man, made, wells, the, presence, of, water, on, the, surface, or, underground, is, necessary, and, the, local, or, regional, management, of, this, essential, resource, is, strategic, but, not, sufficient, to, create, such, areas, continuous, human, work, and, know, how, a, technical, and, social, culture, are, essential, to, maintain, such, ecosystems, some, of, the, possible, human, contributions, to, maintaining, an, oasis, include, digging, and, maintaining, wells, digging, and, maintaining, canals, and, continuously, removing, opportunistic, plants, that, threaten, to, gorge, themselves, on, water, and, fertility, needed, to, maintain, human, and, animal, food, supplies, stereotypically, an, oasis, has, a, central, pool, of, open, water, surrounded, by, a, ring, of, water, dependent, shrubs, and, trees, which, are, in, turn, encircled, by, an, outlying, transition, zone, to, desert, plants, rain, showers, provide, subterranean, water, to, sustain, natural, oases, such, as, the, tuat, substrata, of, impermeable, rock, and, stone, can, trap, water, and, retain, it, in, pockets, or, on, long, faulting, subsurface, ridges, or, volcanic, dikes, water, can, collect, and, percolate, to, the, surface, any, incidence, of, water, is, then, used, by, migrating, birds, which, also, pass, seeds, with, their, droppings, which, will, grow, at, the, water, s, edge, forming, an, oasis, it, can, also, be, used, to, plant, crops, oases, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, cover, about, 1, 000, 000, hectares, 10, 000, km, 2, however, they, support, the, livelihood, of, about, 10, million, inhabitants, the, stark, ratio, of, oasis, to, desert, land, in, the, world, means, that, the, oasis, ecosystem, is, relatively, minute, rare, and, precious, there, are, 90, major, oases, within, the, sahara, desert, some, of, their, fertility, may, derive, from, irrigation, systems, called, foggaras, khettaras, lkhttarts, or, a, variety, of, other, regional, names, in, some, oases, systems, there, is, a, geometrical, system, of, raised, channels, that, release, controlled, amounts, of, the, water, into, individual, plots, soaking, the, soil, oases, often, have, human, histories, that, are, measured, in, millennia, archeological, digs, at, ein, gedi, in, the, dead, sea, valley, have, found, evidence, of, settlement, dating, to, 6, 000, bc, al, ahsa, on, the, arabian, peninsula, shows, evidence, of, human, residence, dating, to, the, neolithic, anthropologically, the, oasis, is, an, area, of, sedentary, life, which, associates, the, city, or, village, with, its, surrounding, feeding, source, the, palm, grove, within, a, relational, and, circulatory, nomadic, system, the, location, of, oases, has, been, of, critical, importance, for, trade, and, transportation, routes, in, desert, areas, caravans, must, travel, via, oases, so, that, supplies, of, water, and, food, can, be, replenished, thus, political, or, military, control, of, an, oasis, has, in, many, cases, meant, control, of, trade, on, a, particular, route, for, example, the, oases, of, awjila, ghadames, and, kufra, situated, in, modern, day, libya, have, at, various, times, been, vital, to, both, north, south, and, east, west, trade, in, the, sahara, desert, the, location, of, oases, also, informed, the, darb, el, arba, n, trade, route, from, sudan, to, egypt, as, well, as, the, caravan, route, from, the, niger, river, to, tangier, morocco, the, silk, road, traced, its, course, from, water, hole, to, water, hole, relying, on, oasis, communities, such, as, turpan, in, china, and, samarkand, in, uzbekistan, according, to, the, united, nations, oases, are, at, the, very, heart, of, the, overall, development, of, peri, saharan, countries, due, to, their, geographical, location, and, the, fact, they, are, preferred, migration, routes, in, times, of, famine, or, insecurity, in, the, region, oases, in, oman, on, the, arabian, peninsula, near, the, persian, gulf, vary, somewhat, from, the, saharan, form, while, still, located, in, an, arid, or, semi, arid, zone, with, a, date, palm, overstory, these, oases, are, usually, located, below, plateaus, and, watered, either, by, springs, or, by, aflaj, tunnel, systems, dug, into, the, ground, or, carved, into, the, rock, to, tap, underground, aquifers, this, rainwater, harvesting, system, never, developed, a, serious, salinity, problem, in, the, drylands, of, southwestern, north, america, there, is, a, habitat, form, called, palm, oasis, alternately, palm, series, or, oasis, scrub, woodland, that, has, the, native, california, fan, palm, as, the, overstory, species, these, palm, oases, can, be, found, in, california, arizona, baja, california, and, sonora, people, who, live, in, an, oasis, must, manage, land, and, water, use, carefully, the, most, important, plant, in, an, oasis, is, the, date, palm, phoenix, dactylifera, l, which, forms, the, upper, layer, these, palm, trees, provide, shade, for, smaller, understory, trees, like, apricots, dates, figs, olives, and, peach, trees, which, form, the, middle, layer, market, garden, vegetables, some, cereals, such, as, sorghum, barley, millet, and, wheat, and, or, mixed, animal, fodder, are, grown, in, the, bottom, layer, where, there, is, more, moisture, the, oasis, is, integrated, into, its, desert, environment, through, an, often, close, association, with, nomadic, transhumant, livestock, farming, very, often, pastoral, and, sedentary, populations, are, clearly, distinguished, the, fertility, of, the, oasis, soil, is, restored, by, cyclic, organic, inputs, of, animal, origin, in, summary, an, oasis, palm, grove, is, a, highly, anthropized, and, irrigated, area, that, supports, a, traditionally, intensive, and, polyculture, based, agriculture, responding, to, environmental, constraints, the, three, strata, create, what, is, called, the, oasis, effect, the, three, layers, and, all, their, interaction, points, create, a, variety, of, combinations, of, horizontal, wind, speed, relative, air, temperature, and, relative, air, humidity, the, plantings, through, a, virtuous, cycle, of, wind, reduction, increased, shade, and, evapotranspiration, create, a, microclimate, favorable, to, crops, measurements, taken, in, different, oases, have, showed, that, the, potential, evapotranspiration, of, the, areas, was, reduced, by, 30, to, 50, percent, within, the, oasis, the, keystone, date, palm, trees, are, a, main, income, source, and, staple, food, for, local, populations, in, many, countries, in, which, they, are, cultivated, and, have, played, significant, roles, in, the, economy, society, and, environment, of, those, countries, challenges, for, date, palm, oasis, polycultures, include, low, rainfall, high, temperatures, water, resources, often, high, in, salt, content, and, high, incidence, of, pests, the, oases, consist, of, almost, unbroken, forests, of, date, palms, divided, up, into, many, gardens, that, are, separated, by, mud, walls, and, intersected, by, innumerable, irrigation, and, drainage, ditches, in, the, shade, of, the, palms, are, grown, many, other, kinds, of, fruit, trees, oranges, olives, figs, apricots, peaches, pomegranates, and, jujubes, interlaced, with, large, grape, vines, that, often, hang, in, festoons, from, the, palm, trunks, beneath, the, trees, are, small, plots, of, garden, vegetables, barley, and, alfalfa, neither, date, palms, nor, other, trees, are, planted, with, any, regularity, and, the, growth, is, often, so, dense, that, the, garden, resembles, a, tropical, jungle, very, beautiful, are, these, gardens, in, the, spring, when, the, apricot, and, peach, trees, are, in, blossom, here, and, there, among, the, palms, and, the, figs, and, vines, are, putting, forth, their, leaves, in, autumn, when, the, dates, are, ripening, the, color, effects, especially, when, the, tops, of, the, palms, are, lit, up, by, the, last, rays, of, the, setting, sun, are, something, that, once, seen, can, never, be, forgotten, the, great, clusters, of, fruit, displaying, every, tint, from, bright, yellow, through, orange, vermilion, and, maroon, to, plum, purple, and, chestnut, brown, with, their, brilliant, yellow, or, rich, orange, ivory, like, stalks, contrast, superbly, with, the, dull, bluish, or, gray, green, of, the, feathery, crowns, of, foliage, it, is, small, wonder, that, a, whole, folklore, of, poetic, legends, and, proverbs, has, grown, up, around, the, date, palm, in, the, regions, where, it, flourishes, many, historic, oases, have, struggled, with, drought, and, inadequate, maintenance, according, to, a, united, nations, report, on, the, future, of, oases, in, the, sahara, and, sahel, increasingly, oases, are, subject, to, various, pressures, heavily, influenced, by, the, effects, of, climate, change, decreasing, groundwater, levels, and, a, gradual, loss, of, cultural, heritage, due, to, a, fading, historical, memory, concerning, traditional, water, management, techniques, these, natural, pressures, are, compounded, by, demographic, pressures, and, the, introduction, of, modern, water, pumping, techniques, that, can, disrupt, traditional, resource, management, schemes, particularly, in, the, north, saharan, oases, for, example, five, historic, oases, in, the, western, desert, of, egypt, kharga, dakhla, farafra, baharyia, and, siwa, once, had, flowing, spring, and, wells, but, due, to, the, decline, of, groundwater, heads, because, of, overuse, for, land, reclamation, projects, those, water, sources, are, no, more, and, the, oases, suffer, as, a, result, morocco, has, lost, two, thirds, of, its, oasis, habitat, over, the, last, 100, years, due, to, heat, drought, and, water, scarcity, the, ferkla, oases, in, morocco, once, drew, on, water, from, the, ferkla, sat, and, tangarfa, rivers, but, they, are, now, dry, but, for, a, few, days, a, year, a, 1920, usgs, publication, about, watering, holes, in, the, deserts, of, california, and, arizona, gave, this, advice, for, travelers, seeking, oases, the, usual, watering, places, are, springs, or, wells, springs, are, frequently, clogged, with, gravel, or, rubbish, or, sometimes, even, with, the, bodies, of, dead, animals, and, it, may, be, necessary, to, clean, them, out, for, this, work, a, shovel, is, needed, wells, may, or, may, not, be, equipped, with, pumps, frequently, the, pumps, are, broken, and, useless, and, a, rope, and, bucket, are, then, necessary, to, obtain, water, most, of, the, wells, in, this, region, are, less, than, 100, feet, deep, but, some, are, deeper, and, 100, feet, of, rope, is, not, too, much, to, provide, as, a, rule, the, rope, and, bucket, at, a, well, if, they, were, ever, provided, soon, disappear, and, one, should, never, trust, the, chance, of, finding, them, there, open, wells, are, sometimes, contaminated, in, the, same, way, as, springs, and, need, to, be, cleaned, out, particularly, in, little, frequented, places, where, they, are, unused, for, months, at, a, time
