erbium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, er, and, atomic, number, 68, a, silvery, white, solid, metal, when, artificially, isolated, natural, erbium, is, always, found, in, chemical, combination, with, other, elements, it, is, a, lanthanide, a, rare, earth, element, originally, found, in, the, gadolinite, mine, in, ytterby, sweden, which, is, the, source, of, the, element, s, name, erbium, s, principal, uses, involve, its, pink, colored, er, 3, ions, which, have, optical, fluorescent, properties, particularly, useful, in, certain, laser, applications, erbium, doped, glasses, or, crystals, can, be, used, as, optical, amplification, media, where, er, 3, ions, are, optically, pumped, at, around, 980, or, 1480, nm, and, then, radiate, light, at, 1530, nm, in, stimulated, emission, this, process, results, in, an, unusually, mechanically, simple, laser, optical, amplifier, for, signals, transmitted, by, fiber, optics, the, 1550, nm, wavelength, is, especially, important, for, optical, communications, because, standard, single, mode, optical, fibers, have, minimal, loss, at, this, particular, wavelength, in, addition, to, optical, fiber, amplifier, lasers, a, large, variety, of, medical, applications, e, g, dermatology, dentistry, rely, on, the, erbium, ion, s, 2940, nm, emission, see, er, yag, laser, when, lit, at, another, wavelength, which, is, highly, absorbed, in, water, in, tissues, making, its, effect, very, superficial, such, shallow, tissue, deposition, of, laser, energy, is, helpful, in, laser, surgery, and, for, the, efficient, production, of, steam, which, produces, enamel, ablation, by, common, types, of, dental, laser, a, trivalent, element, pure, erbium, metal, is, malleable, or, easily, shaped, soft, yet, stable, in, air, and, does, not, oxidize, as, quickly, as, some, other, rare, earth, metals, its, salts, are, rose, colored, and, the, element, has, characteristic, sharp, absorption, spectra, bands, in, visible, light, ultraviolet, and, near, infrared, otherwise, it, looks, much, like, the, other, rare, earths, its, sesquioxide, is, called, erbia, erbium, s, properties, are, to, a, degree, dictated, by, the, kind, and, amount, of, impurities, present, erbium, does, not, play, any, known, biological, role, but, is, thought, to, be, able, to, stimulate, metabolism, erbium, is, ferromagnetic, below, 19, k, antiferromagnetic, between, 19, and, 80, k, and, paramagnetic, above, 80, k, erbium, can, form, propeller, shaped, atomic, clusters, er, 3, n, where, the, distance, between, the, erbium, atoms, is, 0, 35, nm, those, clusters, can, be, isolated, by, encapsulating, them, into, fullerene, molecules, as, confirmed, by, transmission, electron, microscopy, like, most, rare, earth, elements, erbium, is, usually, found, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, however, it, is, possible, for, erbium, to, also, be, found, in, the, 0, 1, and, 2, oxidation, states, erbium, metal, retains, its, luster, in, dry, air, however, will, tarnish, slowly, in, moist, air, and, burns, readily, to, form, erbium, iii, oxide, erbium, is, quite, electropositive, and, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quite, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, erbium, hydroxide, erbium, metal, reacts, with, all, the, halogens, erbium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, hydrated, er, iii, ions, which, exist, as, rose, red, 3, hydration, complexes, naturally, occurring, erbium, is, composed, of, 6, stable, isotopes, 162, er, 164, er, 166, er, 167, er, 168, er, and, 170, er, with, 166, er, being, the, most, abundant, 33, 503, natural, abundance, 32, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, the, most, stable, being, 169, er, with, a, half, life, of, 9, 392, d, 172, er, with, a, half, life, of, 49, 3, h, 160, er, with, a, half, life, of, 28, 58, h, 165, er, with, a, half, life, of, 10, 36, h, and, 171, er, with, a, half, life, of, 7, 516, h, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 3, 5, h, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 4, minutes, this, element, also, has, 26, meta, states, with, the, most, stable, being, 149m, er, with, a, half, life, of, 8, 9, s, the, isotopes, of, erbium, range, in, 143, er, to, 180, er, the, primary, decay, mode, before, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 166, er, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, decay, the, primary, decay, products, before, 166, er, are, element, 67, holmium, isotopes, and, the, primary, products, after, are, element, 69, thulium, isotopes, 165, er, has, been, identified, as, useful, for, use, in, auger, therapy, as, it, decays, via, electron, capture, and, emits, no, gamma, radiation, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, radioactive, tracer, to, label, antibodies, and, peptides, though, it, cannot, be, detected, by, any, kind, of, imaging, for, the, study, of, its, biological, distribution, the, isotope, can, be, produced, via, the, bombardment, of, 166, er, with, 165, tm, or, 165, er, with, 165, ho, the, latter, of, which, is, more, convenient, due, to, 165, ho, being, a, stable, primordial, isotope, though, it, requires, an, initial, supply, of, 165, er, erbium, iii, oxide, also, known, as, erbia, is, the, only, known, oxide, of, erbium, first, isolated, by, carl, gustaf, mosander, in, 1843, and, first, obtained, in, pure, form, in, 1905, by, georges, urbain, and, charles, james, it, has, a, cubic, structure, resembling, the, bixbyite, motif, the, er, 3, centers, are, octahedral, the, formation, of, erbium, oxide, is, accomplished, by, burning, erbium, metal, erbium, oxalate, or, other, oxyacid, salts, of, erbium, erbium, oxide, is, insoluble, in, water, and, slightly, soluble, in, heated, mineral, acids, the, pink, colored, compound, is, used, as, a, phosphor, activator, and, to, produce, infrared, absorbing, glass, erbium, iii, fluoride, is, a, pinkish, powder, that, can, be, produced, by, reacting, erbium, iii, nitrate, and, ammonium, fluoride, it, can, be, used, to, make, infrared, light, transmitting, materials, and, up, converting, luminescent, materials, and, is, an, intermediate, in, the, production, of, erbium, metal, prior, to, its, reduction, with, calcium, erbium, iii, chloride, is, a, violet, compounds, that, can, be, formed, by, first, heating, erbium, iii, oxide, and, ammonium, chloride, to, produce, the, ammonium, salt, of, the, pentachloride, 2, ercl, 5, then, heating, it, in, a, vacuum, at, 350, 400, c, it, forms, crystals, of, the, alcl, 3, type, with, monoclinic, crystals, and, the, point, group, c, 2, m, erbium, iii, chloride, hexahydrate, also, forms, monoclinic, crystals, with, the, point, group, of, p, 2, n, p, 2, c, c, 4, 2h, in, this, compound, erbium, is, octa, coordinated, to, form, ions, with, the, isolated, cl, completing, the, structure, erbium, iii, bromide, is, a, violet, solid, it, is, used, like, other, metal, bromide, compounds, in, water, treatment, chemical, analysis, and, for, certain, crystal, growth, applications, erbium, iii, iodide, is, a, slightly, pink, compound, that, is, insoluble, in, water, it, can, be, prepared, by, directly, reacting, erbium, with, iodine, organoerbium, compounds, are, very, similar, to, those, of, the, other, lanthanides, as, they, all, share, an, inability, to, undergo, backbonding, they, are, thus, mostly, restricted, to, the, mostly, ionic, cyclopentadienides, isostructural, with, those, of, lanthanum, and, the, bonded, simple, alkyls, and, aryls, some, of, which, may, be, polymeric, erbium, for, ytterby, a, village, in, sweden, was, discovered, by, carl, gustaf, mosander, in, 1843, mosander, was, working, with, a, sample, of, what, was, thought, to, be, the, single, metal, oxide, yttria, derived, from, the, mineral, gadolinite, he, discovered, that, the, sample, contained, at, least, two, metal, oxides, in, addition, to, pure, yttria, which, he, named, erbia, and, terbia, after, the, village, of, ytterby, where, the, gadolinite, had, been, found, mosander, was, not, certain, of, the, purity, of, the, oxides, and, later, tests, confirmed, his, uncertainty, not, only, did, the, yttria, contain, yttrium, erbium, and, terbium, in, the, ensuing, years, chemists, geologists, and, spectroscopists, discovered, five, additional, elements, ytterbium, scandium, thulium, holmium, and, gadolinium, 701, erbia, and, terbia, however, were, confused, at, this, time, marc, delafontaine, a, swiss, spectroscopist, mistakenly, switched, the, names, of, the, two, elements, in, his, work, separating, the, oxides, erbia, and, terbia, after, 1860, terbia, was, renamed, erbia, and, after, 1877, what, had, been, known, as, erbia, was, renamed, terbia, fairly, pure, er, 2, o, 3, was, independently, isolated, in, 1905, by, georges, urbain, and, charles, james, reasonably, pure, erbium, metal, was, not, produced, until, 1934, when, wilhelm, klemm, and, heinrich, bommer, reduced, the, anhydrous, chloride, with, potassium, vapor, it, was, only, in, the, 1990s, that, the, price, for, chinese, derived, erbium, oxide, became, low, enough, for, erbium, to, be, considered, for, use, as, a, colorant, in, art, glass, the, concentration, of, erbium, in, the, earth, crust, is, about, 2, 8, mg, kg, and, in, seawater, 0, 9, ng, l, concentration, of, less, abundant, elements, may, vary, with, location, by, several, orders, of, magnitude, making, the, relative, abundance, unreliable, like, other, rare, earths, this, element, is, never, found, as, a, free, element, in, nature, but, is, found, in, monazite, and, bastn, site, ores, it, has, historically, been, very, difficult, and, expensive, to, separate, rare, earths, from, each, other, in, their, ores, but, ion, exchange, chromatography, methods, developed, in, the, late, 20th, century, have, greatly, reduced, the, cost, of, production, of, all, rare, earth, metals, and, their, chemical, compounds, the, principal, commercial, sources, of, erbium, are, from, the, minerals, xenotime, and, euxenite, and, most, recently, the, ion, adsorption, clays, of, southern, china, consequently, china, has, now, become, the, principal, global, supplier, of, this, element, in, the, high, yttrium, versions, of, these, ore, concentrates, yttrium, is, about, two, thirds, of, the, total, by, weight, and, erbia, is, about, 4, 5, when, the, concentrate, is, dissolved, in, acid, the, erbia, liberates, enough, erbium, ion, to, impart, a, distinct, and, characteristic, pink, color, to, the, solution, this, color, behavior, is, similar, to, what, mosander, and, the, other, early, workers, in, the, lanthanides, saw, in, their, extracts, from, the, gadolinite, minerals, of, ytterby, crushed, minerals, are, attacked, by, hydrochloric, or, sulfuric, acid, that, transforms, insoluble, rare, earth, oxides, into, soluble, chlorides, or, sulfates, the, acidic, filtrates, are, partially, neutralized, with, caustic, soda, sodium, hydroxide, to, ph, 3, 4, thorium, precipitates, out, of, solution, as, hydroxide, and, is, removed, after, that, the, solution, is, treated, with, ammonium, oxalate, to, convert, rare, earths, into, their, insoluble, oxalates, the, oxalates, are, converted, to, oxides, by, annealing, the, oxides, are, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, that, excludes, one, of, the, main, components, cerium, whose, oxide, is, insoluble, in, hno, 3, the, solution, is, treated, with, magnesium, nitrate, to, produce, a, crystallized, mixture, of, double, salts, of, rare, earth, metals, the, salts, are, separated, by, ion, exchange, in, this, process, rare, earth, ions, are, sorbed, onto, suitable, ion, exchange, resin, by, exchange, with, hydrogen, ammonium, or, cupric, ions, present, in, the, resin, the, rare, earth, ions, are, then, selectively, washed, out, by, suitable, complexing, agent, erbium, metal, is, obtained, from, its, oxide, or, salts, by, heating, with, calcium, at, 1450, c, under, argon, atmosphere, a, large, variety, of, medical, applications, i, e, dermatology, dentistry, utilize, erbium, ion, s, 2940, nm, emission, see, er, yag, laser, which, is, highly, absorbed, in, water, absorption, coefficient, about, 12, 000, cm, such, shallow, tissue, deposition, of, laser, energy, is, necessary, for, laser, surgery, and, the, efficient, production, of, steam, for, laser, enamel, ablation, in, dentistry, common, applications, of, erbium, lasers, in, dentistry, include, ceramic, cosmetic, dentistry, and, removal, of, brackets, in, orthodontic, braces, such, laser, applications, have, been, noted, as, more, time, efficient, than, performing, the, same, procedures, with, rotary, dental, instruments, erbium, doped, optical, silica, glass, fibers, are, the, active, element, in, erbium, doped, fiber, amplifiers, edfas, which, are, widely, used, in, optical, communications, the, same, fibers, can, be, used, to, create, fiber, lasers, in, order, to, work, efficiently, erbium, doped, fiber, is, usually, co, doped, with, glass, modifiers, homogenizers, often, aluminium, or, phosphorus, these, dopants, help, prevent, clustering, of, er, ions, and, transfer, the, energy, more, efficiently, between, excitation, light, also, known, as, optical, pump, and, the, signal, co, doping, of, optical, fiber, with, er, and, yb, is, used, in, high, power, er, yb, fiber, lasers, erbium, can, also, be, used, in, erbium, doped, waveguide,
