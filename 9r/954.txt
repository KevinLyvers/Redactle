in, theoretical, physics, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, is, the, study, of, the, strong, interaction, between, quarks, mediated, by, gluons, quarks, are, fundamental, particles, that, make, up, composite, hadrons, such, as, the, proton, neutron, and, pion, qcd, is, a, type, of, quantum, field, theory, called, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, with, symmetry, group, su, 3, the, qcd, analog, of, electric, charge, is, a, property, called, color, gluons, are, the, force, carriers, of, the, theory, just, as, photons, are, for, the, electromagnetic, force, in, quantum, electrodynamics, the, theory, is, an, important, part, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, a, large, body, of, experimental, evidence, for, qcd, has, been, gathered, over, the, years, qcd, exhibits, three, salient, properties, physicist, murray, gell, mann, coined, the, word, quark, in, its, present, sense, it, originally, comes, from, the, phrase, three, quarks, for, muster, mark, in, finnegans, wake, by, james, joyce, on, june, 27, 1978, gell, mann, wrote, a, private, letter, to, the, editor, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, which, he, related, that, he, had, been, influenced, by, joyce, s, words, the, allusion, to, three, quarks, seemed, perfect, originally, only, three, quarks, had, been, discovered, the, three, kinds, of, charge, in, qcd, as, opposed, to, one, in, quantum, electrodynamics, or, qed, are, usually, referred, to, as, color, charge, by, loose, analogy, to, the, three, kinds, of, color, red, green, and, blue, perceived, by, humans, other, than, this, nomenclature, the, quantum, parameter, color, is, completely, unrelated, to, the, everyday, familiar, phenomenon, of, color, the, force, between, quarks, is, known, as, the, colour, force, or, color, force, or, strong, interaction, and, is, responsible, for, the, nuclear, force, since, the, theory, of, electric, charge, is, dubbed, electrodynamics, the, greek, word, chr, ma, color, is, applied, to, the, theory, of, color, charge, chromodynamics, with, the, invention, of, bubble, chambers, and, spark, chambers, in, the, 1950s, experimental, particle, physics, discovered, a, large, and, ever, growing, number, of, particles, called, hadrons, it, seemed, that, such, a, large, number, of, particles, could, not, all, be, fundamental, first, the, particles, were, classified, by, charge, and, isospin, by, eugene, wigner, and, werner, heisenberg, then, in, 1953, 56, according, to, strangeness, by, murray, gell, mann, and, kazuhiko, nishijima, see, gell, mann, nishijima, formula, to, gain, greater, insight, the, hadrons, were, sorted, into, groups, having, similar, properties, and, masses, using, the, eightfold, way, invented, in, 1961, by, gell, mann, and, yuval, ne, eman, gell, mann, and, george, zweig, correcting, an, earlier, approach, of, shoichi, sakata, went, on, to, propose, in, 1963, that, the, structure, of, the, groups, could, be, explained, by, the, existence, of, three, flavors, of, smaller, particles, inside, the, hadrons, the, quarks, gell, mann, also, briefly, discussed, a, field, theory, model, in, which, quarks, interact, with, gluons, perhaps, the, first, remark, that, quarks, should, possess, an, additional, quantum, number, was, made, as, a, short, footnote, in, the, preprint, of, boris, struminsky, in, connection, with, the, hyperon, being, composed, of, three, strange, quarks, with, parallel, spins, this, situation, was, peculiar, because, since, quarks, are, fermions, such, a, combination, is, forbidden, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, three, identical, quarks, cannot, form, an, antisymmetric, s, state, in, order, to, realize, an, antisymmetric, orbital, s, state, it, is, necessary, for, the, quark, to, have, an, additional, quantum, number, boris, struminsky, was, a, phd, student, of, nikolay, bogolyubov, the, problem, considered, in, this, preprint, was, suggested, by, nikolay, bogolyubov, who, advised, boris, struminsky, in, this, research, in, the, beginning, of, 1965, nikolay, bogolyubov, boris, struminsky, and, albert, tavkhelidze, wrote, a, preprint, with, a, more, detailed, discussion, of, the, additional, quark, quantum, degree, of, freedom, this, work, was, also, presented, by, albert, tavkhelidze, without, obtaining, consent, of, his, collaborators, for, doing, so, at, an, international, conference, in, trieste, italy, in, may, 1965, a, similar, mysterious, situation, was, with, the, baryon, in, the, quark, model, it, is, composed, of, three, up, quarks, with, parallel, spins, in, 1964, 65, greenberg, and, han, nambu, independently, resolved, the, problem, by, proposing, that, quarks, possess, an, additional, su, 3, gauge, degree, of, freedom, later, called, color, charge, han, and, nambu, noted, that, quarks, might, interact, via, an, octet, of, vector, gauge, bosons, the, gluons, since, free, quark, searches, consistently, failed, to, turn, up, any, evidence, for, the, new, particles, and, because, an, elementary, particle, back, then, was, defined, as, a, particle, that, could, be, separated, and, isolated, gell, mann, often, said, that, quarks, were, merely, convenient, mathematical, constructs, not, real, particles, the, meaning, of, this, statement, was, usually, clear, in, context, he, meant, quarks, are, confined, but, he, also, was, implying, that, the, strong, interactions, could, probably, not, be, fully, described, by, quantum, field, theory, richard, feynman, argued, that, high, energy, experiments, showed, quarks, are, real, particles, he, called, them, partons, since, they, were, parts, of, hadrons, by, particles, feynman, meant, objects, that, travel, along, paths, elementary, particles, in, a, field, theory, the, difference, between, feynman, s, and, gell, mann, s, approaches, reflected, a, deep, split, in, the, theoretical, physics, community, feynman, thought, the, quarks, have, a, distribution, of, position, or, momentum, like, any, other, particle, and, he, correctly, believed, that, the, diffusion, of, parton, momentum, explained, diffractive, scattering, although, gell, mann, believed, that, certain, quark, charges, could, be, localized, he, was, open, to, the, possibility, that, the, quarks, themselves, could, not, be, localized, because, space, and, time, break, down, this, was, the, more, radical, approach, of, s, matrix, theory, james, bjorken, proposed, that, pointlike, partons, would, imply, certain, relations, in, deep, inelastic, scattering, of, electrons, and, protons, which, were, verified, in, experiments, at, slac, in, 1969, this, led, physicists, to, abandon, the, s, matrix, approach, for, the, strong, interactions, in, 1973, the, concept, of, color, as, the, source, of, a, strong, field, was, developed, into, the, theory, of, qcd, by, physicists, harald, fritzsch, and, heinrich, leutwyler, together, with, physicist, murray, gell, mann, in, particular, they, employed, the, general, field, theory, developed, in, 1954, by, chen, ning, yang, and, robert, mills, see, yang, mills, theory, in, which, the, carrier, particles, of, a, force, can, themselves, radiate, further, carrier, particles, this, is, different, from, qed, where, the, photons, that, carry, the, electromagnetic, force, do, not, radiate, further, photons, the, discovery, of, asymptotic, freedom, in, the, strong, interactions, by, david, gross, david, politzer, and, frank, wilczek, allowed, physicists, to, make, precise, predictions, of, the, results, of, many, high, energy, experiments, using, the, quantum, field, theory, technique, of, perturbation, theory, evidence, of, gluons, was, discovered, in, three, jet, events, at, petra, in, 1979, these, experiments, became, more, and, more, precise, culminating, in, the, verification, of, perturbative, qcd, at, the, level, of, a, few, percent, at, lep, at, cern, the, other, side, of, asymptotic, freedom, is, confinement, since, the, force, between, color, charges, does, not, decrease, with, distance, it, is, believed, that, quarks, and, gluons, can, never, be, liberated, from, hadrons, this, aspect, of, the, theory, is, verified, within, lattice, qcd, computations, but, is, not, mathematically, proven, one, of, the, millennium, prize, problems, announced, by, the, clay, mathematics, institute, requires, a, claimant, to, produce, such, a, proof, other, aspects, of, non, perturbative, qcd, are, the, exploration, of, phases, of, quark, matter, including, the, quark, gluon, plasma, every, field, theory, of, particle, physics, is, based, on, certain, symmetries, of, nature, whose, existence, is, deduced, from, observations, these, can, be, qcd, is, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, or, yang, mills, theory, of, the, su, 3, gauge, group, obtained, by, taking, the, color, charge, to, define, a, local, symmetry, since, the, strong, interaction, does, not, discriminate, between, different, flavors, of, quark, qcd, has, approximate, flavor, symmetry, which, is, broken, by, the, differing, masses, of, the, quarks, there, are, additional, global, symmetries, whose, definitions, require, the, notion, of, chirality, discrimination, between, left, and, right, handed, if, the, spin, of, a, particle, has, a, positive, projection, on, its, direction, of, motion, then, it, is, called, right, handed, otherwise, it, is, left, handed, chirality, and, handedness, are, not, the, same, but, become, approximately, equivalent, at, high, energies, as, mentioned, asymptotic, freedom, means, that, at, large, energy, this, corresponds, also, to, short, distances, there, is, practically, no, interaction, between, the, particles, this, is, in, contrast, more, precisely, one, would, say, dual, to, what, one, is, used, to, since, usually, one, connects, the, absence, of, interactions, with, large, distances, however, as, already, mentioned, in, the, original, paper, of, franz, wegner, a, solid, state, theorist, who, introduced, 1971, simple, gauge, invariant, lattice, models, the, high, temperature, behaviour, of, the, original, model, e, g, the, strong, decay, of, correlations, at, large, distances, corresponds, to, the, low, temperature, behaviour, of, the, usually, ordered, dual, model, namely, the, asymptotic, decay, of, non, trivial, correlations, e, g, short, range, deviations, from, almost, perfect, arrangements, for, short, distances, here, in, contrast, to, wegner, we, have, only, the, dual, model, which, is, that, one, described, in, this, article, the, color, group, su, 3, corresponds, to, the, local, symmetry, whose, gauging, gives, rise, to, qcd, the, electric, charge, labels, a, representation, of, the, local, symmetry, group, u, 1, which, is, gauged, to, give, qed, this, is, an, abelian, group, if, one, considers, a, version, of, qcd, with, n, f, flavors, of, massless, quarks, then, there, is, a, global, chiral, flavor, symmetry, group, su, l, n, f, su, r, n, f, u, b, 1, u, a, 1, the, chiral, symmetry, is, spontaneously, broken, by, the, qcd, vacuum, to, the, vector, l, r, su, v, n, f, with, the, formation, of, a, chiral, condensate, the, vector, symmetry, u, b, 1, corresponds, to, the, baryon, number, of, quarks, and, is, an, exact, symmetry, the, axial, symmetry, u, a, 1, is, exact, in, the, classical, theory, but, broken, in, the, quantum, theory, an, occurrence, called, an, anomaly, gluon, field, configurations, called, instantons, are, closely, related, to, this, anomaly, there, are, two, different, types, of, su, 3, symmetry, there, is, the, symmetry, that, acts, on, the, different, colors, of, quarks, and, this, is, an, exact, gauge, symmetry, mediated, by, the, gluons, and, there, is, also, a, flavor, symmetry, that, rotates, different, flavors, of, quarks, to, each, other, or, flavor, su, 3, flavor, su, 3, is, an, approximate, symmetry, of, the, vacuum, of, qcd, and, is, not, a, fundamental, symmetry, at, all, it, is, an, accidental, consequence, of, the, small, mass, of, the, three, lightest, quarks, in, the, qcd, vacuum, there, are, vacuum, condensates, of, all, the, quarks, whose, mass, is, less, than, the, qcd, scale, this, includes, the, up, and, down, quarks, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, strange, quark, but, not, any, of, the, others, the, vacuum, is, symmetric, under, su, 2, isospin, rotations, of, up, and, down, and, to, a, lesser, extent, under, rotations, of, up, down, and, strange, or, full, flavor, group, su, 3, and, the, observed, particles, make, isospin, and, su, 3, multiplets, the, approximate, flavor, symmetries, do, have, associated, gauge, bosons, observed, particles, like, the, rho, and, the, omega, but, these, particles, are, nothing, like, the, gluons, and, they, are, not, massless, they, are, emergent, gauge, bosons, in, an, approximate, string, description, of, qcd, the, dynamics, of, the, quarks, and, gluons, are, defined, by, the, quantum, chromodynamics, lagrangian, the, gauge, invariant, qcd, lagrangian, is, where, i, x, displaystyle, psi, i, x, is, the, quark, field, a, dynamical, function, of, spacetime, in, the, fundamental, representation, of, the, su, 3, gauge, group, indexed, by, i, displaystyle, i, and, j, displaystyle, j, running, from, 1, displaystyle, 1, to, 3, displaystyle, 3, d, displaystyle, d, mu, is, the, gauge, covariant, derivative, the, are, gamma, matrices, connecting, the, spinor, representation, to, the, vector, representation, of, the, lorentz, group, herein, the, gauge, covariant, derivative, d, i, j, i, j, i, g, t, a, i, j, a, a, displaystyle, left, d, mu, right, ij, partial, mu, delta, ij, ig, left, t, a, right, ij, mathcal, a, mu, a, couples, the, quark, field, with, a, coupling, strength, g, displaystyle, g, to, the, gluon, fields, via, the, infinitesimal, su, 3, generators, t, a, displaystyle, t, a, in, the, fundamental, representation, an, explicit, representation, of, these, generators, is, given, by, t, a, a, 2, displaystyle, t, a, lambda, a, 2, wherein, the, a, a, 1, 8, displaystyle, lambda, a, a, 1, ldots, 8, are, the, gell, mann, matrices, the, symbol, g, a, displaystyle, g, mu, nu, a, represents, the, gauge, invariant, gluon, field, strength, tensor, analogous, to, the, electromagnetic, field, strength, tensor, f, in, quantum, electrodynamics, it, is, given, by, where, a, a, x, displaystyle, mathcal, a, mu, a, x, are, the, gluon, fields, dynamical, functions, of, spacetime, in, the, adjoint, representation, of, the, su, 3, gauge, group, indexed, by, a, b, and, c, running, from, 1, displaystyle, 1, to, 8, displaystyle, 8, and, f, abc, are, the, structure, constants, of, su, 3, the, generators, of, the, adjoint, representation, note, that, the, rules, to, move, up, or, pull, down, the, a, b, or, c, indices, are, trivial, so, that, f, abc, f, abc, f, a, bc, whereas, for, the, or, indices, one, has, the, non, trivial, relativistic, rules, corresponding, to, the, metric, signature, the, variables, m, and, g, correspond, to, the, quark, mass, and, coupling, of, the, theory, respectively, which, are, subject, to, renormalization, an, important, theoretical, concept, is, the, wilson, loop, named, after, kenneth, g, wilson, in, lattice, qcd, the, final, term, of, the, above, lagrangian, is, discretized, via, wilson, loops, and, more, generally, the, behavior, of, wilson, loops, can, distinguish, confined, and, deconfined, phases, quarks, are, massive, spin, 1, 2, fermions, that, carry, a, color, charge, whose, gauging, is, the, content, of, qcd, quarks, are, represented, by, dirac, fields, in, the, fundamental, representation, 3, of, the, gauge, group, su, 3, they, also, carry, electric, charge, either, 1, 3, or, 2, 3, and, participate, in, weak, interactions, as, part, of, weak, isospin, doublets, they, carry, global, quantum, numbers, including, the, baryon, number, which, is, 1, 3, for, each, quark, hypercharge, and, one, of, the, flavor, quantum, numbers, gluons, are, spin, 1, bosons, that, also, carry, color, charges, since, they, lie, in, the, adjoint, representation, 8, of, su, 3, they, have, no, electric, charge, do, not, participate, in, the, weak, interactions, and, have, no, flavor, they, lie, in, the, singlet, representation, 1, of, all, these, symmetry, groups, each, type, of, quark, has, a, corresponding, antiquark, of, which, the, charge, is, exactly, opposite, they, transform, in, the, conjugate, representation, to, quarks, denoted, 3, displaystyle, bar, mathbf, 3, according, to, the, rules, of, quantum, field, theory, and, the, associated, feynman, diagrams, the, above, theory, gives, rise, to, three, basic, interactions, a, quark, may, emit, or, absorb, a, gluon, a, gluon, may, emit, or, absorb, a, gluon, and, two, gluons, may, directly, interact, this, contrasts, with, qed, in, which, only, the, first, kind, of, interaction, occurs, since, photons, have, no, charge, diagrams, involving, faddeev, popov, ghosts, must, be, considered, too, except, in, the, unitarity, gauge, detailed, computations, with, the, above, mentioned, lagrangian, show, that, the, effective, potential, between, a, quark, and, its, anti, quark, in, a, meson, contains, a, term, that, increases, in, proportion, to, the, distance, between, the, quark, and, anti, quark, r, displaystyle, propto, r, which, represents, some, kind, of, stiffness, of, the, interaction, between, the, particle, and, its, anti, particle, at, large, distances, similar, to, the, entropic, elasticity, of, a, rubber, band, see, below, this, leads, to, confinement, of, the, quarks, to, the, interior, of, hadrons, i, e, mesons, and, nucleons, with, typical, radii, r, c, corresponding, to, former, bag, models, of, the, hadrons, the, order, of, magnitude, of, the, bag, radius, is, 1, fm, 10, 15, m, moreover, the, above, mentioned, stiffness, is, quantitatively, related, to, the, so, called, area, law, behavior, of, the, expectation, value, of, the, wilson, loop, product, p, w, of, the, ordered, coupling, constants, around, a, closed, loop, w, i, e, p, w, displaystyle, langle, p, w, rangle, is, proportional, to, the, area, enclosed, by, the, loop, for, this, behavior, the, non, abelian, behavior, of, the, gauge, group, is, essential, further, analysis, of, the, content, of, the, theory, is, complicated, various, techniques, have, been, developed, to, work, with, qcd, some, of, them, are, discussed, briefly, below, this, approach, is, based, on, asymptotic, freedom, which, allows, perturbation, theory, to, be, used, accurately, in, experiments, performed, at, very, high, energies, although, limited, in, scope, this, approach, has, resulted, in, the, most, precise, tests, of, qcd, to, date, among, non, perturbative, approaches, to, qcd, the, most, well, established, is, lattice, qcd, this, approach, uses, a, discrete, set, of, spacetime, points, called, the, lattice, to, reduce, the, analytically, intractable, path, integrals, of, the, continuum, theory, to, a, very, difficult, numerical, computation, that, is, then, carried, out, on, supercomputers, like, the, qcdoc, which, was, constructed, for, precisely, this, purpose, while, it, is, a, slow, and, resource, intensive, approach, it, has, wide, applicability, giving, insight, into, parts, of, the, theory, inaccessible, by, other, means, in, particular, into, the, explicit, forces, acting, between, quarks, and, antiquarks, in, a, meson, however, the, numerical, sign, problem, makes, it, difficult, to, use, lattice, methods, to, study, qcd, at, high, density, and, low, temperature, e, g, nuclear, matter, or, the, interior, of, neutron, stars, a, well, known, approximation, scheme, the, 1, n, expansion, starts, from, the, idea, that, the, number, of, colors, is, infinite, and, makes, a, series, of, corrections, to, account, for, the, fact, that, it, is, not, until, now, it, has, been, the, source, of, qualitative, insight, rather, than, a, method, for, quantitative, predictions, modern, variants, include, the, ads, cft, approach, for, specific, problems, effective, theories, may, be, written, down, that, give, qualitatively, correct, results, in, certain, limits, in, the, best, of, cases, these, may, then, be, obtained, as, systematic, expansions, in, some, parameters, of, the, qcd, lagrangian, one, such, effective, field, theory, is, chiral, perturbation, theory, or, chipt, which, is, the, qcd, effective, theory, at, low, energies, more, precisely, it, is, a, low, energy, expansion, based, on, the, spontaneous, chiral, symmetry, breaking, of, qcd, which, is, an, exact, symmetry, when, quark, masses, are, equal, to, zero, but, for, the, u, d, and, s, quark, which, have, small, mass, it, is, still, a, good, approximate, symmetry, depending, on, the, number, of, quarks, that, are, treated, as, light, one, uses, either, su, 2, chipt, or, su, 3, chipt, other, effective, theories, are, heavy, quark, effective, theory, which, expands, around, heavy, quark, mass, near, infinity, and, soft, collinear, effective, theory, which, expands, around, large, ratios, of, energy, scales, in, addition, to, effective, theories, models, like, the, nambu, jona, lasinio, model, and, the, chiral, model, are, often, used, when, discussing, general, features, based, on, an, operator, product, expansion, one, can, derive, sets, of, relations, that, connect, different, observables, with, each, other, the, notion, of, quark, flavors, was, prompted, by, the, necessity, of, explaining, the, properties, of, hadrons, during, the, development, of, the, quark, model, the, notion, of, color, was, necessitated, by, the, puzzle, of, the, this, has, been, dealt, with, in, the, section, on, the, history, of, qcd, the, first, evidence, for, quarks, as, real, constituent, elements, of, hadrons, was, obtained, in, deep, inelastic, scattering, experiments, at, slac, the, first, evidence, for, gluons, came, in, three, jet, events, at, petra, several, good, quantitative, tests, of, perturbative, qcd, exist, quantitative, tests, of, non, perturbative, qcd, are, fewer, because, the, predictions, are, harder, to, make, the, best, is, probably, the, running, of, the, qcd, coupling, as, probed, through, lattice, computations, of, heavy, quarkonium, spectra, there, is, a, recent, claim, about, the, mass, of, the, heavy, meson, b, c, other, non, perturbative, tests, are, currently, at, the, level, of, 5, at, best, continuing, work, on, masses, and, form, factors, of, hadrons, and, their, weak, matrix, elements, are, promising, candidates, for, future, quantitative, tests, the, whole, subject, of, quark, matter, and, the, quark, gluon, plasma, is, a, non, perturbative, test, bed, for, qcd, that, still, remains, to, be, properly, exploited, one, qualitative, prediction, of, qcd, is, that, there, exist, composite, particles, made, solely, of, gluons, called, glueballs, that, have, not, yet, been, definitively, observed, experimentally, a, definitive, observation, of, a, glueball, with, the, properties, predicted, by, qcd, would, strongly, confirm, the, theory, in, principle, if, glueballs, could, be, definitively, ruled, out, this, would, be, a, serious, experimental, blow, to, qcd, but, as, of, 2013, scientists, are, unable, to, confirm, or, deny, the, existence, of, glueballs, definitively, despite, the, fact, that, particle, accelerators, have, sufficient, energy, to, generate, them, there, are, unexpected, cross, relations, to, condensed, matter, physics, for, example, the, notion, of, gauge, invariance, forms, the, basis, of, the, well, known, mattis, spin, glasses, which, are, systems, with, the, usual, spin, degrees, of, freedom, s, i, 1, displaystyle, s, i, pm, 1, for, i, 1, n, with, the, special, fixed, random, couplings, j, i, k, i, j, 0, k, displaystyle, j, i, k, epsilon, i, j, 0, epsilon, k, here, the, i, and, k, quantities, can, independently, and, randomly, take, the, values, 1, which, corresponds, to, a, most, simple, gauge, transformation, s, i, s, i, i, j, i, k, i, j, i, k, k, s, k, s, k, k, displaystyle, s, i, to, s, i, cdot, epsilon, i, quad, j, i, k, to, epsilon, i, j, i, k, epsilon, k, quad, s, k, to, s, k, cdot, epsilon, k, this, means, that, thermodynamic, expectation, values, of, measurable, quantities, e, g, of, the, energy, h, s, i, j, i, k, s, k, textstyle, mathcal, h, sum, s, i, j, i, k, s, k, are, invariant, however, here, the, coupling, degrees, of, freedom, j, i, k, displaystyle, j, i, k, which, in, the, qcd, correspond, to, the, gluons, are, frozen, to, fixed, values, quenching, in, contrast, in, the, qcd, they, fluctuate, annealing, and, through, the, large, number, of, gauge, degrees, of, freedom, the, entropy, plays, an, important, role, see, below, for, positive, j, 0, the, thermodynamics, of, the, mattis, spin, glass, corresponds, in, fact, simply, to, a, ferromagnet, in, disguise, just, because, these, systems, have, no, frustration, at, all, this, term, is, a, basic, measure, in, spin, glass, theory, quantitatively, it, is, identical, with, the, loop, product, p, w, j, i, k, j, k, l, j, n, m, j, m, i, displaystyle, p, w, j, i, k, j, k, l, j, n, m, j, m, i, along, a, closed, loop, w, however, for, a, mattis, spin, glass, in, contrast, to, genuine, spin, glasses, the, quantity, p, w, never, becomes, negative, the, basic, notion, frustration, of, the, spin, glass, is, actually, similar, to, the, wilson, loop, quantity, of, the, qcd, the, only, difference, is, again, that, in, the, qcd, one, is, dealing, with, su, 3, matrices, and, that, one, is, dealing, with, a, fluctuating, quantity, energetically, perfect, absence, of, frustration, should, be, non, favorable, and, atypical, for, a, spin, glass, which, means, that, one, should, add, the, loop, product, to, the, hamiltonian, by, some, kind, of, term, representing, a, punishment, in, the, qcd, the, wilson, loop, is, essential, for, the, lagrangian, rightaway, the, relation, between, the, qcd, and, disordered, magnetic, systems, the, spin, glasses, belong, to, them, were, additionally, stressed, in, a, paper, by, fradkin, huberman, and, shenker, which, also, stresses, the, notion, of, duality, a, further, analogy, consists, in, the, already, mentioned, similarity, to, polymer, physics, where, analogously, to, wilson, loops, so, called, entangled, nets, appear, which, are, important, for, the, formation, of, the, entropy, elasticity, force, proportional, to, the, length, of, a, rubber, band, the, non, abelian, character, of, the, su, 3, corresponds, thereby, to, the, non, trivial, chemical, links, which, glue, different, loop, segments, together, and, asymptotic, freedom, means, in, the, polymer, analogy, simply, the, fact, that, in, the, short, wave, limit, i, e, for, 0, w, r, c, displaystyle, 0, leftarrow, lambda, w, ll, r, c, where, r, c, is, a, characteristic, correlation, length, for, the, glued, loops, corresponding, to, the, above, mentioned, bag, radius, while, w, is, the, wavelength, of, an, excitation, any, non, trivial, correlation, vanishes, totally, as, if, the, system, had, crystallized, there, is, also, a, correspondence, between, confinement, in, qcd, the, fact, that, the, color, field, is, only, different, from, zero, in, the, interior, of, hadrons, and, the, behaviour, of, the, usual, magnetic, field, in, the, theory, of, type, ii, superconductors, there, the, magnetism, is, confined, to, the, interior, of, the, abrikosov, flux, line, lattice, i, e, the, london, penetration, depth, of, that, theory, is, analogous, to, the, confinement, radius, r, c, of, quantum, chromodynamics, mathematically, this, correspondendence, is, supported, by, the, second, term, g, g, a, i, t, i, j, a, j, displaystyle, propto, gg, mu, a, bar, psi, i, gamma, mu, t, ij, a, psi, j, on, the, r, h, s,
