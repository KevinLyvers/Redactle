outer, space, or, simply, space, is, the, expanse, that, exists, beyond, earth, s, atmosphere, and, between, celestial, bodies, it, contains, ultra, low, levels, of, particle, densities, constituting, a, near, perfect, vacuum, of, predominantly, hydrogen, and, helium, plasma, permeated, by, electromagnetic, radiation, cosmic, rays, neutrinos, magnetic, fields, and, dust, the, baseline, temperature, of, outer, space, as, set, by, the, background, radiation, from, the, big, bang, is, 2, 7, kelvins, 270, c, 455, f, the, plasma, between, galaxies, is, thought, to, account, for, about, half, of, the, baryonic, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, having, a, number, density, of, less, than, one, hydrogen, atom, per, cubic, metre, and, a, kinetic, temperature, of, millions, of, kelvins, local, concentrations, of, matter, have, condensed, into, stars, and, galaxies, intergalactic, space, takes, up, most, of, the, volume, of, the, universe, but, even, galaxies, and, star, systems, consist, almost, entirely, of, empty, space, most, of, the, remaining, mass, energy, in, the, observable, universe, is, made, up, of, an, unknown, form, dubbed, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, outer, space, does, not, begin, at, a, definite, altitude, above, earth, s, surface, the, k, rm, n, line, an, altitude, of, 100, km, 62, mi, above, sea, level, is, conventionally, used, as, the, start, of, outer, space, in, space, treaties, and, for, aerospace, records, keeping, certain, portions, of, the, upper, stratosphere, and, the, mesosphere, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, near, space, the, framework, for, international, space, law, was, established, by, the, outer, space, treaty, which, entered, into, force, on, 10, october, 1967, this, treaty, precludes, any, claims, of, national, sovereignty, and, permits, all, states, to, freely, explore, outer, space, despite, the, drafting, of, un, resolutions, for, the, peaceful, uses, of, outer, space, anti, satellite, weapons, have, been, tested, in, earth, orbit, the, concept, that, the, space, between, the, earth, and, the, moon, must, be, a, vacuum, was, first, proposed, in, the, 17th, century, after, scientists, discovered, that, air, pressure, decreased, with, altitude, the, immense, scale, of, outer, space, was, grasped, in, the, 20th, century, when, the, distance, to, the, andromeda, galaxy, was, first, measured, humans, began, the, physical, exploration, of, space, later, in, the, same, century, with, the, advent, of, high, altitude, balloon, flights, this, was, followed, by, crewed, rocket, flights, and, then, crewed, earth, orbit, first, achieved, by, yuri, gagarin, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1961, the, economic, cost, of, putting, objects, including, humans, into, space, is, very, high, limiting, human, spaceflight, to, low, earth, orbit, and, the, moon, on, the, other, hand, uncrewed, spacecraft, have, reached, all, of, the, known, planets, in, the, solar, system, outer, space, represents, a, challenging, environment, for, human, exploration, because, of, the, hazards, of, vacuum, and, radiation, microgravity, has, a, negative, effect, on, human, physiology, that, causes, both, muscle, atrophy, and, bone, loss, the, use, of, the, short, version, space, as, meaning, the, region, beyond, earth, s, sky, predates, the, use, of, full, term, outer, space, with, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, this, meaning, in, an, epic, poem, by, john, milton, called, paradise, lost, published, in, 1667, the, term, outward, space, existed, in, a, poem, from, 1842, by, the, english, poet, lady, emmeline, stuart, wortley, called, the, maiden, of, moscow, but, in, astronomy, the, term, outer, space, found, its, application, for, the, first, time, in, 1845, by, alexander, von, humboldt, the, term, was, eventually, popularized, through, the, writings, of, h, g, wells, after, 1901, theodore, von, k, rm, n, used, the, term, of, free, space, to, name, the, space, of, altitudes, above, earth, where, spacecrafts, reach, conditions, sufficiently, free, from, atmospheric, drag, differentiating, it, from, airspace, identifying, a, legal, space, above, territories, free, from, the, sovereign, jurisdiction, of, countries, spaceborne, denotes, existing, in, outer, space, especially, if, carried, by, a, spacecraft, similarly, space, based, means, based, in, outer, space, or, on, a, planet, or, moon, the, size, of, the, whole, universe, is, unknown, and, it, might, be, infinite, in, extent, according, to, the, big, bang, theory, the, very, early, universe, was, an, extremely, hot, and, dense, state, about, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, which, rapidly, expanded, about, 380, 000, years, later, the, universe, had, cooled, sufficiently, to, allow, protons, and, electrons, to, combine, and, form, hydrogen, the, so, called, recombination, epoch, when, this, happened, matter, and, energy, became, decoupled, allowing, photons, to, travel, freely, through, the, continually, expanding, space, matter, that, remained, following, the, initial, expansion, has, since, undergone, gravitational, collapse, to, create, stars, galaxies, and, other, astronomical, objects, leaving, behind, a, deep, vacuum, that, forms, what, is, now, called, outer, space, as, light, has, a, finite, velocity, this, theory, constrains, the, size, of, the, directly, observable, universe, the, present, day, shape, of, the, universe, has, been, determined, from, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, using, satellites, like, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, these, observations, indicate, that, the, spatial, geometry, of, the, observable, universe, is, flat, meaning, that, photons, on, parallel, paths, at, one, point, remain, parallel, as, they, travel, through, space, to, the, limit, of, the, observable, universe, except, for, local, gravity, the, flat, universe, combined, with, the, measured, mass, density, of, the, universe, and, the, accelerating, expansion, of, the, universe, indicates, that, space, has, a, non, zero, vacuum, energy, which, is, called, dark, energy, estimates, put, the, average, energy, density, of, the, present, day, universe, at, the, equivalent, of, 5, 9, protons, per, cubic, meter, including, dark, energy, dark, matter, and, baryonic, matter, ordinary, matter, composed, of, atoms, the, atoms, account, for, only, 4, 6, of, the, total, energy, density, or, a, density, of, one, proton, per, four, cubic, meters, the, density, of, the, universe, is, clearly, not, uniform, it, ranges, from, relatively, high, density, in, galaxies, including, very, high, density, in, structures, within, galaxies, such, as, planets, stars, and, black, holes, to, conditions, in, vast, voids, that, have, much, lower, density, at, least, in, terms, of, visible, matter, unlike, matter, and, dark, matter, dark, energy, seems, not, to, be, concentrated, in, galaxies, although, dark, energy, may, account, for, a, majority, of, the, mass, energy, in, the, universe, dark, energy, s, influence, is, 5, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, than, the, influence, of, gravity, from, matter, and, dark, matter, within, the, milky, way, outer, space, is, the, closest, known, approximation, to, a, perfect, vacuum, it, has, effectively, no, friction, allowing, stars, planets, and, moons, to, move, freely, along, their, ideal, orbits, following, the, initial, formation, stage, the, deep, vacuum, of, intergalactic, space, is, not, devoid, of, matter, as, it, contains, a, few, hydrogen, atoms, per, cubic, meter, by, comparison, the, air, humans, breathe, contains, about, 10, 25, molecules, per, cubic, meter, the, low, density, of, matter, in, outer, space, means, that, electromagnetic, radiation, can, travel, great, distances, without, being, scattered, the, mean, free, path, of, a, photon, in, intergalactic, space, is, about, 10, 23, km, or, 10, billion, light, years, in, spite, of, this, extinction, which, is, the, absorption, and, scattering, of, photons, by, dust, and, gas, is, an, important, factor, in, galactic, and, intergalactic, astronomy, stars, planets, and, moons, retain, their, atmospheres, by, gravitational, attraction, atmospheres, have, no, clearly, delineated, upper, boundary, the, density, of, atmospheric, gas, gradually, decreases, with, distance, from, the, object, until, it, becomes, indistinguishable, from, outer, space, the, earth, s, atmospheric, pressure, drops, to, about, 0, 032, pa, at, 100, kilometres, 62, miles, of, altitude, compared, to, 100, 000, pa, for, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, definition, of, standard, pressure, above, this, altitude, isotropic, gas, pressure, rapidly, becomes, insignificant, when, compared, to, radiation, pressure, from, the, sun, and, the, dynamic, pressure, of, the, solar, wind, the, thermosphere, in, this, range, has, large, gradients, of, pressure, temperature, and, composition, and, varies, greatly, due, to, space, weather, the, temperature, of, outer, space, is, measured, in, terms, of, the, kinetic, activity, of, the, gas, as, it, is, on, earth, the, radiation, of, outer, space, has, a, different, temperature, than, the, kinetic, temperature, of, the, gas, meaning, that, the, gas, and, radiation, are, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, all, of, the, observable, universe, is, filled, with, photons, that, were, created, during, the, big, bang, which, is, known, as, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, cmb, there, is, quite, likely, a, correspondingly, large, number, of, neutrinos, called, the, cosmic, neutrino, background, the, current, black, body, temperature, of, the, background, radiation, is, about, 2, 7, k, 455, f, the, gas, temperatures, in, outer, space, can, vary, widely, for, example, the, temperature, in, the, boomerang, nebula, is, 1, k, 458, f, while, the, solar, corona, reaches, temperatures, over, 1, 200, 000, 2, 600, 000, k, 2, 200, 000, 4, 700, 000, f, magnetic, fields, have, been, detected, in, the, space, around, just, about, every, class, of, celestial, object, star, formation, in, spiral, galaxies, can, generate, small, scale, dynamos, creating, turbulent, magnetic, field, strengths, of, around, 5, 10, g, the, davis, greenstein, effect, causes, elongated, dust, grains, to, align, themselves, with, a, galaxy, s, magnetic, field, resulting, in, weak, optical, polarization, this, has, been, used, to, show, ordered, magnetic, fields, that, exist, in, several, nearby, galaxies, magneto, hydrodynamic, processes, in, active, elliptical, galaxies, produce, their, characteristic, jets, and, radio, lobes, non, thermal, radio, sources, have, been, detected, even, among, the, most, distant, high, z, sources, indicating, the, presence, of, magnetic, fields, outside, a, protective, atmosphere, and, magnetic, field, there, are, few, obstacles, to, the, passage, through, space, of, energetic, subatomic, particles, known, as, cosmic, rays, these, particles, have, energies, ranging, from, about, 10, 6, ev, up, to, an, extreme, 10, 20, ev, of, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, the, peak, flux, of, cosmic, rays, occurs, at, energies, of, about, 10, 9, ev, with, approximately, 87, protons, 12, helium, nuclei, and, 1, heavier, nuclei, in, the, high, energy, range, the, flux, of, electrons, is, only, about, 1, of, that, of, protons, cosmic, rays, can, damage, electronic, components, and, pose, a, health, threat, to, space, travelers, according, to, astronauts, like, don, pettit, space, has, a, burned, metallic, odor, that, clings, to, their, suits, and, equipment, similar, to, the, scent, of, an, arc, welding, torch, despite, the, harsh, environment, several, life, forms, have, been, found, that, can, withstand, extreme, space, conditions, for, extended, periods, species, of, lichen, carried, on, the, esa, biopan, facility, survived, exposure, for, ten, days, in, 2007, seeds, of, arabidopsis, thaliana, and, nicotiana, tabacum, germinated, after, being, exposed, to, space, for, 1, 5, years, a, strain, of, bacillus, subtilis, has, survived, 559, days, when, exposed, to, low, earth, orbit, or, a, simulated, martian, environment, the, lithopanspermia, hypothesis, suggests, that, rocks, ejected, into, outer, space, from, life, harboring, planets, may, successfully, transport, life, forms, to, another, habitable, world, a, conjecture, is, that, just, such, a, scenario, occurred, early, in, the, history, of, the, solar, system, with, potentially, microorganism, bearing, rocks, being, exchanged, between, venus, earth, and, mars, the, lack, of, pressure, in, space, is, the, most, immediate, dangerous, characteristic, of, space, to, humans, pressure, decreases, above, earth, reaching, a, level, at, an, altitude, of, around, 19, 14, km, 11, 89, mi, that, matches, the, vapor, pressure, of, water, at, the, temperature, of, the, human, body, this, pressure, level, is, called, the, armstrong, line, named, after, american, physician, harry, g, armstrong, at, or, above, the, armstrong, line, fluids, in, the, throat, and, lungs, boil, away, more, specifically, exposed, bodily, liquids, such, as, saliva, tears, and, liquids, in, the, lungs, boil, away, hence, at, this, altitude, human, survival, requires, a, pressure, suit, or, a, pressurized, capsule, out, in, space, sudden, exposure, of, an, unprotected, human, to, very, low, pressure, such, as, during, a, rapid, decompression, can, cause, pulmonary, barotrauma, a, rupture, of, the, lungs, due, to, the, large, pressure, differential, between, inside, and, outside, the, chest, even, if, the, subject, s, airway, is, fully, open, the, flow, of, air, through, the, windpipe, may, be, too, slow, to, prevent, the, rupture, rapid, decompression, can, rupture, eardrums, and, sinuses, bruising, and, blood, seep, can, occur, in, soft, tissues, and, shock, can, cause, an, increase, in, oxygen, consumption, that, leads, to, hypoxia, as, a, consequence, of, rapid, decompression, oxygen, dissolved, in, the, blood, empties, into, the, lungs, to, try, to, equalize, the, partial, pressure, gradient, once, the, deoxygenated, blood, arrives, at, the, brain, humans, lose, consciousness, after, a, few, seconds, and, die, of, hypoxia, within, minutes, blood, and, other, body, fluids, boil, when, the, pressure, drops, below, 6, 3, kilopascals, 1, psi, and, this, condition, is, called, ebullism, the, steam, may, bloat, the, body, to, twice, its, normal, size, and, slow, circulation, but, tissues, are, elastic, and, porous, enough, to, prevent, rupture, ebullism, is, slowed, by, the, pressure, containment, of, blood, vessels, so, some, blood, remains, liquid, swelling, and, ebullism, can, be, reduced, by, containment, in, a, pressure, suit, the, crew, altitude, protection, suit, caps, a, fitted, elastic, garment, designed, in, the, 1960s, for, astronauts, prevents, ebullism, at, pressures, as, low, as, 2, kilopascals, 0, 3, psi, supplemental, oxygen, is, needed, at, 8, km, 5, mi, to, provide, enough, oxygen, for, breathing, and, to, prevent, water, loss, while, above, 20, km, 12, mi, pressure, suits, are, essential, to, prevent, ebullism, most, space, suits, use, around, 30, 39, kilopascals, 4, 6, psi, of, pure, oxygen, about, the, same, as, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, at, the, earth, s, surface, this, pressure, is, high, enough, to, prevent, ebullism, but, evaporation, of, nitrogen, dissolved, in, the, blood, could, still, cause, decompression, sickness, and, gas, embolisms, if, not, managed, humans, evolved, for, life, in, earth, gravity, and, exposure, to, weightlessness, has, been, shown, to, have, deleterious, effects, on, human, health, initially, more, than, 50, of, astronauts, experience, space, motion, sickness, this, can, cause, nausea, and, vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and, overall, malaise, the, duration, of, space, sickness, varies, but, it, typically, lasts, for, 1, 3, days, after, which, the, body, adjusts, to, the, new, environment, longer, term, exposure, to, weightlessness, results, in, muscle, atrophy, and, deterioration, of, the, skeleton, or, spaceflight, osteopenia, these, effects, can, be, minimized, through, a, regimen, of, exercise, other, effects, include, fluid, redistribution, slowing, of, the, cardiovascular, system, decreased, production, of, red, blood, cells, balance, disorders, and, a, weakening, of, the, immune, system, lesser, symptoms, include, loss, of, body, mass, nasal, congestion, sleep, disturbance, and, puffiness, of, the, face, during, long, duration, space, travel, radiation, can, pose, an, acute, health, hazard, exposure, to, high, energy, ionizing, cosmic, rays, can, result, in, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as, well, as, damage, to, the, immune, system, and, changes, to, the, white, blood, cell, count, over, longer, durations, symptoms, include, an, increased, risk, of, cancer, plus, damage, to, the, eyes, nervous, system, lungs, and, the, gastrointestinal, tract, on, a, round, trip, mars, mission, lasting, three, years, a, large, fraction, of, the, cells, in, an, astronaut, s, body, would, be, traversed, and, potentially, damaged, by, high, energy, nuclei, the, energy, of, such, particles, is, significantly, diminished, by, the, shielding, provided, by, the, walls, of, a, spacecraft, and, can, be, further, diminished, by, water, containers, and, other, barriers, the, impact, of, the, cosmic, rays, upon, the, shielding, produces, additional, radiation, that, can, affect, the, crew, further, research, is, needed, to, assess, the, radiation, hazards, and, determine, suitable, countermeasures, the, transition, between, earth, s, atmosphere, and, outer, space, lacks, a, well, defined, physical, boundary, with, the, air, pressure, steadily, decreasing, with, altitude, until, it, mixes, with, the, solar, wind, various, definitions, for, a, practical, boundary, have, been, proposed, ranging, from, 30, km, 19, mi, out, to, 1, 600, 000, km, 990, 000, mi, high, altitude, aircraft, such, as, high, altitude, balloons, have, reached, altitudes, above, earth, of, up, to, 50, km, up, until, 2021, the, united, states, designated, people, who, travel, above, an, altitude, of, 50, mi, 80, km, as, astronauts, astronaut, wings, are, now, only, awarded, to, spacecraft, crew, members, that, demonstrated, activities, during, flight, that, were, essential, to, public, safety, or, contributed, to, human, space, flight, safety, in, 2009, measurements, of, the, direction, and, speed, of, ions, in, the, atmosphere, were, made, from, a, sounding, rocket, the, altitude, of, 118, km, 73, 3, mi, above, earth, was, the, midpoint, for, charged, particles, transitioning, from, the, gentle, winds, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, to, the, more, extreme, flows, of, outer, space, the, latter, can, reach, velocities, well, over, 268, m, s, 880, ft, s, spacecraft, have, entered, into, a, highly, elliptical, orbit, with, a, perigee, as, low, as, 80, to, 90, km, 50, to, 56, mi, surviving, for, multiple, orbits, at, an, altitude, of, 120, km, 75, mi, descending, spacecraft, such, as, nasa, s, space, shuttle, begin, atmospheric, entry, termed, the, entry, interface, when, atmospheric, drag, becomes, noticeable, thus, beginning, the, process, of, switching, from, steering, with, thrusters, to, maneuvering, with, aerodynamic, control, surfaces, the, k, rm, n, line, established, by, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, and, used, internationally, by, the, united, nations, is, set, at, an, altitude, of, 100, km, 62, mi, as, a, working, definition, for, the, boundary, between, aeronautics, and, astronautics, this, line, is, named, after, theodore, von, k, rm, n, who, argued, for, an, altitude, where, a, vehicle, would, have, to, travel, faster, than, orbital, velocity, to, derive, sufficient, aerodynamic, lift, from, the, atmosphere, to, support, itself, which, he, calculated, to, be, at, an, altitude, of, about, 83, 8, km, 52, 1, mi, this, distinguishes, altitudes, below, as, the, region, of, aerodynamics, and, airspace, and, above, as, the, space, of, astronautics, and, free, space, there, is, no, internationally, recognized, legal, altitude, limit, on, national, airspace, although, the, k, rm, n, line, is, the, most, frequently, used, for, this, purpose, objections, have, been, made, to, setting, this, limit, too, high, as, it, could, inhibit, space, activities, due, to, concerns, about, airspace, violations, it, has, been, argued, for, setting, no, specified, singular, altitude, in, international, law, instead, applying, different, limits, depending, on, the, case, in, particular, based, on, the, craft, and, its, purpose, spacecraft, have, flown, over, foreign, countries, as, low, as, 30, km, 19, mi, as, in, the, example, of, the, space, shuttle, the, outer, space, treaty, provides, the, basic, framework, for, international, space, law, it, covers, the, legal, use, of, outer, space, by, nation, states, and, includes, in, its, definition, of, outer, space, the, moon, and, other, celestial, bodies, the, treaty, states, that, outer, space, is, free, for, all, nation, states, to, explore, and, is, not, subject, to, claims, of, national, sovereignty, calling, outer, space, the, province, of, all, mankind, this, status, as, a, common, heritage, of, mankind, has, been, used, though, not, without, opposition, to, enforce, the, right, to, access, and, shared, use, of, outer, space, for, all, nations, equally, particularly, non, spacefaring, nations, it, prohibits, the, deployment, of, nuclear, weapons, in, outer, space, the, treaty, was, passed, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 1963, and, signed, in, 1967, by, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, the, united, states, of, america, usa, and, the, united, kingdom, uk, as, of, 2017, 105, state, parties, have, either, ratified, or, acceded, to, the, treaty, an, additional, 25, states, signed, the, treaty, without, ratifying, it, since, 1958, outer, space, has, been, the, subject, of, multiple, united, nations, resolutions, of, these, more, than, 50, have, been, concerning, the, international, co, operation, in, the, peaceful, uses, of, outer, space, and, preventing, an, arms, race, in, space, four, additional, space, law, treaties, have, been, negotiated, and, drafted, by, the, un, s, committee, on, the, peaceful, uses, of, outer, space, still, there, remains, no, legal, prohibition, against, deploying, conventional, weapons, in, space, and, anti, satellite, weapons, have, been, successfully, tested, by, the, usa, ussr, china, and, in, 2019, india, the, 1979, moon, treaty, turned, the, jurisdiction, of, all, heavenly, bodies, including, the, orbits, around, such, bodies, over, to, the, international, community, the, treaty, has, not, been, ratified, by, any, nation, that, currently, practices, human, spaceflight, in, 1976, eight, equatorial, states, ecuador, colombia, brazil, the, republic, of, the, congo, zaire, uganda, kenya, and, indonesia, met, in, bogot, colombia, with, their, declaration, of, the, first, meeting, of, equatorial, countries, or, the, bogot, declaration, they, claimed, control, of, the, segment, of, the, geosynchronous, orbital, path, corresponding, to, each, country, these, claims, are, not, internationally, accepted, an, increasing, issue, of, international, space, law, and, regulation, has, been, the, dangers, of, the, growing, number, of, space, debris, a, spacecraft, enters, orbit, when, its, centripetal, acceleration, due, to, gravity, is, less, than, or, equal, to, the, centrifugal, acceleration, due, to, the, horizontal, component, of, its, velocity, for, a, low, earth, orbit, this, velocity, is, about, 7, 800, m, s, 28, 100, km, h, 17, 400, mph, by, contrast, the, fastest, piloted, airplane, speed, ever, achieved, excluding, speeds, achieved, by, deorbiting, spacecraft, was, 2, 200, m, s, 7, 900, km, h, 4, 900, mph, in, 1967, by, the, north, american, x, 15, to, achieve, an, orbit, a, spacecraft, must, travel, faster, than, a, sub, orbital, spaceflight, along, an, arcing, trajectory, the, energy, required, to, reach, earth, orbital, velocity, at, an, altitude, of, 600, km, 370, mi, is, about, 36, mj, kg, which, is, six, times, the, energy, needed, merely, to, climb, to, the, corresponding, altitude, the, escape, velocity, required, to, pull, free, of, earth, s, gravitational, field, altogether, and, move, into, interplanetary, space, is, about, 11, 200, m, s, 40, 300, km, h, 25, 100, mph, orbiting, spacecraft, with, a, perigee, below, about, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, are, subject, to, drag, from, the, earth, s, atmosphere, which, decreases, the, orbital, altitude, the, rate, of, orbital, decay, depends, on, the, satellite, s, cross, sectional, area, and, mass, as, well, as, variations, in, the, air, density, of, the, upper, atmosphere, at, altitudes, above, 800, km, 500, mi, orbital, lifetime, is, measured, in, centuries, below, about, 300, km, 190, mi, decay, becomes, more, rapid, with, lifetimes, measured, in, days, once, a, satellite, descends, to, 180, km, 110, mi, it, has, only, hours, before, it, vaporizes, in, the, atmosphere, space, in, proximity, to, the, earth, is, physically, similar, to, the, remainder, of, interplanetary, space, but, is, home, to, a, multitude, of, earth, orbiting, satellites, and, has, been, subject, to, extensive, studies, for, identification, purposes, this, volume, is, divided, into, overlapping, regions, of, space, near, earth, space, is, the, region, of, space, extending, from, low, earth, orbits, out, to, geostationary, orbits, this, region, includes, the, major, orbits, for, artificial, satellites, and, is, the, site, of, most, of, humanity, s, space, activity, the, region, has, seen, high, levels, of, space, debris, sometimes, dubbed, space, pollution, threatening, any, space, activity, in, this, region, some, of, this, debris, re, enters, earth, s, atmosphere, periodically, although, it, meets, the, definition, of, outer, space, the, atmospheric, density, inside, low, earth, orbital, space, the, first, few, hundred, kilometers, above, the, k, rm, n, line, is, still, sufficient, to, produce, significant, drag, on, satellites, geospace, is, a, region, of, space, that, includes, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, and, magnetosphere, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, lie, within, the, geospace, the, outer, boundary, of, geospace, is, the, magnetopause, which, forms, an, interface, between, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, and, the, solar, wind, the, inner, boundary, is, the, ionosphere, the, variable, space, weather, conditions, of, geospace, are, affected, by, the, behavior, of, the, sun, and, the, solar, wind, the, subject, of, geospace, is, interlinked, with, heliophysics, the, study, of, the, sun, and, its, impact, on, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, the, day, side, magnetopause, is, compressed, by, solar, wind, pressure, the, subsolar, distance, from, the, center, of, the, earth, is, typically, 10, earth, radii, on, the, night, side, the, solar, wind, stretches, the, magnetosphere, to, form, a, magnetotail, that, sometimes, extends, out, to, more, than, 100, 200, earth, radii, for, roughly, four, days, of, each, month, the, lunar, surface, is, shielded, from, the, solar, wind, as, the, moon, passes, through, the, magnetotail, geospace, is, populated, by, electrically, charged, particles, at, very, low, densities, the, motions, of, which, are, controlled, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, these, plasmas, form, a, medium, from, which, storm, like, disturbances, powered, by, the, solar, wind, can, drive, electrical, currents, into, the, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, geomagnetic, storms, can, disturb, two, regions, of, geospace, the, radiation, belts, and, the, ionosphere, these, storms, increase, fluxes, of, energetic, electrons, that, can, permanently, damage, satellite, electronics, interfering, with, shortwave, radio, communication, and, gps, location, and, timing, magnetic, storms, can, be, a, hazard, to, astronauts, even, in, low, earth, orbit, they, create, aurorae, seen, at, high, latitudes, in, an, oval, surrounding, the, geomagnetic, poles, xgeo, space, is, a, concept, used, by, the, us, to, refer, to, space, of, high, earth, orbits, ranging, from, beyond, geosynchronous, orbit, geo, at, approximately, 35, 786, km, 22, 236, mi, out, to, the, l2, earth, moon, lagrange, point, at, 448, 900, km, 278, 934, mi, this, is, located, beyond, the, orbit, of, the, moon, and, therefore, includes, cislunar, space, translunar, space, is, the, region, of, lunar, transfer, orbits, between, the, moon, and, earth, cislunar, space, is, a, region, outside, of, earth, that, includes, lunar, orbits, the, moon, s, orbital, space, around, earth, and, the, lagrange, points, the, region, where, a, body, s, gravitational, potential, remains, dominant, against, gravitational, potentials, from, other, bodies, is, the, body, s, sphere, of, influence, or, gravity, well, mostly, described, with, the, hill, sphere, model, in, the, case, of, earth, this, includes, all, space, from, the, earth, to, a,

times, becoming, temporary, satellites, and, quasi, moons, to, earth, deep, space, is, defined, by, the, united, states, government, as, all, of, outer, space, which, lies, further, from, earth, than, a, typical, low, earth, orbit, thus, assigning, the, moon, to, deep, space, other, definitions, vary, the, starting, point, of, deep, space, from, that, which, lies, beyond, the, orbit, of, the, moon, to, that, which, lies, beyond, the, farthest, reaches, of, the, solar, system, itself, the, international, telecommunication, union, responsible, for, radio, communication, including, with, satellites, defines, deep, space, as, distances, from, the, earth, equal, to, or, greater, than, 2, million, km, 1, 2, million, mi, which, is, about, five, times, the, moon, s, orbital, distance, but, which, distance, is, also, far, less, than, the, distance, between, earth, and, any, adjacent, planet, interplanetary, space, within, the, solar, system, is, the, space, between, the, eight, planets, the, space, between, the, planets, and, the, sun, as, well, as, that, space, beyond, the, orbit, of, the, outermost, planet, neptune, where, the, solar, wind, remains, active, the, solar, wind, is, a, continuous, stream, of, charged, particles, emanating, from, the, sun, which, creates, a, very, tenuous, atmosphere, the, heliosphere, for, billions, of, kilometers, into, space, this, wind, has, a, particle, density, of, 5, 10, protons, cm, 3, and, is, moving, at, a, velocity, of, 350, 400, km, s, 780, 000, 890, 000, mph, interplanetary, space, extends, out, to, the, heliopause, where, the, influence, of, the, galactic, environment, starts, to, dominate, over, the, magnetic, field, and, particle, flux, from, the, sun, the, distance, and, strength, of, the, heliopause, varies, depending, on, the, activity, level, of, the, solar, wind, the, heliopause, in, turn, deflects, away, low, energy, galactic, cosmic, rays, with, this, modulation, effect, peaking, during, solar, maximum, the, volume, of, interplanetary, space, is, a, nearly, total, vacuum, with, a, mean, free, path, of, about, one, astronomical, unit, at, the, orbital, distance, of, the, earth, this, space, is, not, completely, empty, and, is, sparsely, filled, with, cosmic, rays, which, include, ionized, atomic, nuclei, and, various, subatomic, particles, there, is, gas, plasma, and, dust, small, meteors, and, several, dozen, types, of, organic, molecules, discovered, to, date, by, microwave, spectroscopy, a, cloud, of, interplanetary, dust, is, visible, at, night, as, a, faint, band, called, the, zodiacal, light, interplanetary, space, contains, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, the, sun, there, are, magnetospheres, generated, by, planets, such, as, jupiter, saturn, mercury, and, the, earth, that, have, their, own, magnetic, fields, these, are, shaped, by, the, influence, of, the, solar, wind, into, the, approximation, of, a, teardrop, shape, with, the, long, tail, extending, outward, behind, the, planet, these, magnetic, fields, can, trap, particles, from, the, solar, wind, and, other, sources, creating, belts, of, charged, particles, such, as, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, planets, without, magnetic, fields, such, as, mars, have, their, atmospheres, gradually, eroded, by, the, solar, wind, interstellar, space, is, the, physical, space, outside, of, the, bubbles, of, plasma, known, as, astrospheres, formed, by, stellar, winds, originating, from, individual, stars, or, formed, by, solar, wind, emanating, from, the, sun, it, is, the, space, between, the, stars, or, stellar, systems, within, a, nebula, or, galaxy, interstellar, space, contains, an, interstellar, medium, of, sparse, matter, and, radiation, the, boundary, between, an, astrosphere, and, interstellar, space, is, known, as, an, astropause, for, the, sun, the, astrosphere, and, astropause, are, called, the, heliosphere, and, heliopause, approximately, 70, of, the, mass, of, the, interstellar, medium, consists, of, lone, hydrogen, atoms, most, of, the, remainder, consists, of, helium, atoms, this, is, enriched, with, trace, amounts, of, heavier, atoms, formed, through, stellar, nucleosynthesis, these, atoms, are, ejected, into, the, interstellar, medium, by, stellar, winds, or, when, evolved, stars, begin, to, shed, their, outer, envelopes, such, as, during, the, formation, of, a, planetary, nebula, the, cataclysmic, explosion, of, a, supernova, propagates, shock, waves, of, stellar, ejecta, outward, distributing, it, throughout, the, interstellar, medium, including, the, heavy, elements, previously, formed, within, the, star, s, core, the, density, of, matter, in, the, interstellar, medium, can, vary, considerably, the, average, is, around, 10, 6, particles, per, m, 3, but, cold, molecular, clouds, can, hold, 10, 8, 10, 12, per, m, 3, a, number, of, molecules, exist, in, interstellar, space, which, can, form, dust, particles, as, tiny, as, 0, 1, m, the, tally, of, molecules, discovered, through, radio, astronomy, is, steadily, increasing, at, the, rate, of, about, four, new, species, per, year, large, regions, of, higher, density, matter, known, as, molecular, clouds, allow, chemical, reactions, to, occur, including, the, formation, of, organic, polyatomic, species, much, of, this, chemistry, is, driven, by, collisions, energetic, cosmic, rays, penetrate, the, cold, dense, clouds, and, ionize, hydrogen, and, helium, resulting, for, example, in, the, trihydrogen, cation, an, ionized, helium, atom, can, then, split, relatively, abundant, carbon, monoxide, to, produce, ionized, carbon, which, in, turn, can, lead, to, organic, chemical, reactions, the, local, interstellar, medium, is, a, region, of, space, within, 100, pc, of, the, sun, which, is, of, interest, both, for, its, proximity, and, for, its, interaction, with, the, solar, system, this, volume, nearly, coincides, with, a, region, of, space, known, as, the, local, bubble, which, is, characterized, by, a, lack, of, dense, cold, clouds, it, forms, a, cavity, in, the, orion, arm, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, with, dense, molecular, clouds, lying, along, the, borders, such, as, those, in, the, constellations, of, ophiuchus, and, taurus, the, actual, distance, to, the, border, of, this, cavity, varies, from, 60, to, 250, pc, or, more, this, volume, contains, about, 10, 4, 10, 5, stars, and, the, local, interstellar, gas, counterbalances, the, astrospheres, that, surround, these, stars, with, the, volume, of, each, sphere, varying, depending, on, the, local, density, of, the, interstellar, medium, the, local, bubble, contains, dozens, of, warm, interstellar, clouds, with, temperatures, of, up, to, 7, 000, k, and, radii, of, 0, 5, 5, pc, when, stars, are, moving, at, sufficiently, high, peculiar, velocities, their, astrospheres, can, generate, bow, shocks, as, they, collide, with, the, interstellar, medium, for, decades, it, was, assumed, that, the, sun, had, a, bow, shock, in, 2012, data, from, interstellar, boundary, explorer, ibex, and, nasa, s, voyager, probes, showed, that, the, sun, s, bow, shock, does, not, exist, instead, these, authors, argue, that, a, subsonic, bow, wave, defines, the, transition, from, the, solar, wind, flow, to, the, interstellar, medium, a, bow, shock, is, a, third, boundary, characteristic, of, an, astrosphere, laying, outside, the, termination, shock, and, the, astropause, intergalactic, space, is, the, physical, space, between, galaxies, studies, of, the, large, scale, distribution, of, galaxies, show, that, the, universe, has, a, foam, like, structure, with, groups, and, clusters, of, galaxies, lying, along, filaments, that, occupy, about, a, tenth, of, the, total, space, the, remainder, forms, cosmic, voids, that, are, mostly, empty, of, galaxies, typically, a, void, spans, a, distance, of, 7, 30, megaparsecs, surrounding, and, stretching, between, galaxies, there, is, a, rarefied, plasma, that, is, organized, in, a, galactic, filamentary, structure, this, material, is, called, the, intergalactic, medium, igm, the, density, of, these, filaments, of, intergalactic, medium, is, about, one, atom, per, cubic, meter, which, is, 5, 200, times, the, average, density, of, the, universe, after, including, the, cosmic, voids, the, igm, is, inferred, to, be, mostly, primordial, in, composition, with, 76, hydrogen, by, mass, and, enriched, with, higher, mass, elements, from, high, velocity, galactic, outflows, as, gas, falls, into, the, intergalactic, medium, from, the, voids, it, heats, up, to, temperatures, of, 10, 5, k, to, 10, 7, k, hence, collisions, between, atoms, have, enough, energy, to, cause, the, bound, electron, to, escape, from, the, hydrogen, nuclei, this, is, why, the, igm, is, ionized, at, these, temperatures, it, is, called, the, warm, hot, intergalactic, medium, whim, although, the, plasma, is, very, hot, by, terrestrial, standards, 10, 5, k, is, often, called, warm, in, astrophysics, computer, simulations, and, observations, indicate, that, up, to, half, of, the, atomic, matter, in, the, universe, might, exist, in, this, warm, hot, rarefied, state, when, gas, falls, from, the, filamentary, structures, of, the, whim, into, the, galaxy, clusters, at, the, intersections, of, the, cosmic, filaments, it, can, heat, up, even, more, reaching, temperatures, of, 10, 8, k, and, above, in, the, so, called, intracluster, medium, icm, in, 350, bce, greek, philosopher, aristotle, suggested, that, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, a, principle, that, became, known, as, the, horror, vacui, this, concept, built, upon, a, 5th, century, bce, ontological, argument, by, the, greek, philosopher, parmenides, who, denied, the, possible, existence, of, a, void, in, space, based, on, this, idea, that, a, vacuum, could, not, exist, in, the, west, it, was, widely, held, for, many, centuries, that, space, could, not, be, empty, as, late, as, the, 17th, century, the, french, philosopher, ren, descartes, argued, that, the, entirety, of, space, must, be, filled, in, ancient, china, the, 2nd, century, astronomer, zhang, heng, became, convinced, that, space, must, be, infinite, extending, well, beyond, the, mechanism, that, supported, the, sun, and, the, stars, the, surviving, books, of, the, hs, an, yeh, school, said, that, the, heavens, were, boundless, empty, and, void, of, substance, likewise, the, sun, moon, and, the, company, of, stars, float, in, the, empty, space, moving, or, standing, still, the, italian, scientist, galileo, galilei, knew, that, air, had, mass, and, so, was, subject, to, gravity, in, 1640, he, demonstrated, that, an, established, force, resisted, the, formation, of, a, vacuum, it, would, remain, for, his, pupil, evangelista, torricelli, to, create, an, apparatus, that, would, produce, a, partial, vacuum, in, 1643, this, experiment, resulted, in, the, first, mercury, barometer, and, created, a, scientific, sensation, in, europe, torricelli, suggested, that, since, air, has, weight, then, air, pressure, should, decrease, with, altitude, the, french, mathematician, blaise, pascal, proposed, an, experiment, to, test, this, hypothesis, in, 1648, his, brother, in, law, florin, p, rier, repeated, the, experiment, on, the, puy, de, d, me, mountain, in, central, france, and, found, that, the, column, was, shorter, by, three, inches, this, decrease, in, pressure, was, further, demonstrated, by, carrying, a, half, full, balloon, up, a, mountain, and, watching, it, gradually, expand, then, contract, upon, descent, in, 1650, german, scientist, otto, von, guericke, constructed, the, first, vacuum, pump, a, device, that, would, further, refute, the, principle, of, horror, vacui, he, correctly, noted, that, the, atmosphere, of, the, earth, surrounds, the, planet, like, a, shell, with, the, density, gradually, declining, with, altitude, he, concluded, that, there, must, be, a, vacuum, between, the, earth, and, the, moon, in, the, 15th, century, german, theologian, nicolaus, cusanus, speculated, that, the, universe, lacked, a, center, and, a, circumference, he, believed, that, the, universe, while, not, infinite, could, not, be, held, as, finite, as, it, lacked, any, bounds, within, which, it, could, be, contained, these, ideas, led, to, speculations, as, to, the, infinite, dimension, of, space, by, the, italian, philosopher, giordano, bruno, in, the, 16th, century, he, extended, the, copernican, heliocentric, cosmology, to, the, concept, of, an, infinite, universe, filled, with, a, substance, he, called, aether, which, did, not, resist, the, motion, of, heavenly, bodies, english, philosopher, william, gilbert, arrived, at, a, similar, conclusion, arguing, that, the, stars, are, visible, to, us, only, because, they, are, surrounded, by, a, thin, aether, or, a, void, this, concept, of, an, aether, originated, with, ancient, greek, philosophers, including, aristotle, who, conceived, of, it, as, the, medium, through, which, the, heavenly, bodies, move, the, concept, of, a, universe, filled, with, a, luminiferous, aether, retained, support, among, some, scientists, until, the, early, 20th, century, this, form, of, aether, was, viewed, as, the, medium, through, which, light, could, propagate, in, 1887, the, michelson, morley, experiment, tried, to, detect, the, earth, s, motion, through, this, medium, by, looking, for, changes, in, the, speed, of, light, depending, on, the, direction, of, the, planet, s, motion, the, null, result, indicated, something, was, wrong, with, the, concept, the, idea, of, the, luminiferous, aether, was, then, abandoned, it, was, replaced, by, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, which, holds, that, the, speed, of, light, in, a, vacuum, is, a, fixed, constant, independent, of, the, observer, s, motion, or, frame, of, reference, the, first, professional, astronomer, to, support, the, concept, of, an, infinite, universe, was, the, englishman, thomas, digges, in, 1576, but, the, scale, of, the, universe, remained, unknown, until, the, first, successful, measurement, of, the, distance, to, a, nearby, star, in, 1838, by, the, german, astronomer, friedrich, bessel, he, showed, that, the, star, system, 61, cygni, had, a, parallax, of, just, 0, 31, arcseconds, compared, to, the, modern, value, of, 0, 287, this, corresponds, to, a, distance, of, over, 10, light, years, in, 1917, heber, curtis, noted, that, novae, in, spiral, nebulae, were, on, average, 10, magnitudes, fainter, than, galactic, novae, suggesting, that, the, former, are, 100, times, further, away, the, distance, to, the, andromeda, galaxy, was, determined, in, 1923, by, american, astronomer, edwin, hubble, by, measuring, the, brightness, of, cepheid, variables, in, that, galaxy, a, new, technique, discovered, by, henrietta, leavitt, this, established, that, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, by, extension, all, galaxies, lay, well, outside, the, milky, way, the, modern, concept, of, outer, space, is, based, on, the, big, bang, cosmology, first, proposed, in, 1931, by, the, belgian, physicist, georges, lema, tre, this, theory, holds, that, the, universe, originated, from, a, state, of, extreme, energy, density, that, has, since, undergone, continuous, expansion, the, earliest, known, estimate, of, the, temperature, of, outer, space, was, by, the, swiss, physicist, charles, guillaume, in, 1896, using, the, estimated, radiation, of, the, background, stars, he, concluded, that, space, must, be, heated, to, a, temperature, of, 5, 6, k, british, physicist, arthur, eddington, made, a, similar, calculation, to, derive, a, temperature, of, 3, 18, k, in, 1926, german, physicist, erich, regener, used, the, total, measured, energy, of, cosmic, rays, to, estimate, an, intergalactic, temperature, of, 2, 8, k, in, 1933, american, physicists, ralph, alpher, and, robert, herman, predicted, 5, k, for, the, temperature, of, space, in, 1948, based, on, the, gradual, decrease, in, background, energy, following, the, then, new, big, bang, theory, for, most, of, human, history, space, was, explored, by, observations, made, from, the, earth, s, surface, initially, with, the, unaided, eye, and, then, with, the, telescope, before, reliable, rocket, technology, the, closest, that, humans, had, come, to, reaching, outer, space, was, through, balloon, flights, in, 1935, the, american, explorer, ii, crewed, balloon, flight, reached, an, altitude, of, 22, km, 14, mi, this, was, greatly, exceeded, in, 1942, when, the, third, launch, of, the, german, a, 4, rocket, climbed, to, an, altitude, of, about, 80, km, 50, mi, in, 1957, the, uncrewed, satellite, sputnik, 1, was, launched, by, a, russian, r, 7, rocket, achieving, earth, orbit, at, an, altitude, of, 215, 939, kilometres, 134, 583, mi, this, was, followed, by, the, first, human, spaceflight, in, 1961, when, yuri, gagarin, was, sent, into, orbit, on, vostok, 1, the, first, humans, to, escape, low, earth, orbit, were, frank, borman, jim, lovell, and, william, anders, in, 1968, on, board, the, american, apollo, 8, which, achieved, lunar, orbit, and, reached, a, maximum, distance, of, 377, 349, km, 234, 474, mi, from, the, earth, the, first, spacecraft, to, reach, escape, velocity, was, the, soviet, luna, 1, which, performed, a, fly, by, of, the, moon, in, 1959, in, 1961, venera, 1, became, the, first, planetary, probe, it, revealed, the, presence, of, the, solar, wind, and, performed, the, first, fly, by, of, venus, although, contact, was, lost, before, reaching, venus, the, first, successful, planetary, mission, was, the, 1962, fly, by, of, venus, by, mariner, 2, the, first, fly, by, of, mars, was, by, mariner, 4, in, 1964, since, that, time, uncrewed, spacecraft, have, successfully, examined, each, of, the, solar, system, s, planets, as, well, their, moons, and, many, minor, planets, and, comets, they, remain, a, fundamental, tool, for, the, exploration, of, outer, space, as, well, as, for, observation, of, the, earth, in, august, 2012, voyager, 1, became, the, first, man, made, object, to, leave, the, solar, system, and, enter, interstellar, space, outer, space, has, become, an, important, element, of, global, society, it, provides, multiple, applications, that, are, beneficial, to, the, economy, and, scientific, research, the, placing, of, artificial, satellites, in, earth, orbit, has, produced, numerous, benefits, and, has, become, the, dominating, sector, of, the, space, economy, they, allow, relay, of, long, range, communications, like, television, provide, a, means, of, precise, navigation, and, permit, direct, monitoring, of, weather, conditions, and, remote, sensing, of, the, earth, the, latter, role, serves, a, variety, of, purposes, including, tracking, soil, moisture, for, agriculture, prediction, of, water, outflow, from, seasonal, snow, packs, detection, of, diseases, in, plants, and, trees, and, surveillance, of, military, activities, they, facilitate, the, discovery, and, monitoring, of, climate, change, influences, satellites, make, use, of, the, significantly, reduced, drag, in, space, to, stay, in, stable, orbits, allowing, them, to, efficiently, span, the, whole, globe, compared, to, for, example, stratospheric, balloons, or, high, altitude, platform, stations, which, have, other, benefits, the, absence, of, air, makes, outer, space, an, ideal, location, for, astronomy, at, all, wavelengths, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, this, is, evidenced, by, the, spectacular, pictures, sent, back, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, allowing, light, from, more, than, 13, billion, years, ago, almost, to, the, time, of, the, big, bang, to, be, observed, not, every, location, in, space, is, ideal, for, a, telescope, the, interplanetary, zodiacal, dust, emits, a, diffuse, near, infrared, radiation, that, can, mask, the, emission, of, faint, sources, such, as, extrasolar, planets, moving, an, infrared, telescope, out, past, the, dust, increases, its, effectiveness, likewise, a, site, like, the, daedalus, crater, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, could, shield, a, radio, telescope, from, the, radio, frequency, interference, that, hampers, earth, based, observations, the, deep, vacuum, of, space, could, make, it, an, attractive, environment, for, certain, industrial, processes, such, as, those, requiring, ultraclean, surfaces, like, asteroid, mining, space, manufacturing, would, require, a, large, financial, investment, with, little, prospect, of, immediate, return, an, important, factor, in, the, total, expense, is, the, high, cost, of, placing, mass, into, earth, orbit, 9, 000, 30, 000, per, kg, according, to, a, 2006, estimate, allowing, for, inflation, since, then, the, cost, of, access, to, space, has, declined, since, 2013, partially, reusable, rockets, such, as, the, falcon, 9, have, lowered, access, to, space, below, 3500, dollars, per, kilogram, with, these, new, rockets, the, cost, to, send, materials, into, space, remains, prohibitively, high, for, many, industries, proposed, concepts, for, addressing, this, issue,
