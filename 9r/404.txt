praseodymium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, pr, and, the, atomic, number, 59, it, is, the, third, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, and, is, considered, one, of, the, rare, earth, metals, it, is, a, soft, silvery, malleable, and, ductile, metal, valued, for, its, magnetic, electrical, chemical, and, optical, properties, it, is, too, reactive, to, be, found, in, native, form, and, pure, praseodymium, metal, slowly, develops, a, green, oxide, coating, when, exposed, to, air, praseodymium, always, occurs, naturally, together, with, the, other, rare, earth, metals, it, is, the, sixth, most, abundant, rare, earth, element, and, fourth, most, abundant, lanthanide, making, up, 9, 1, parts, per, million, of, the, earth, s, crust, an, abundance, similar, to, that, of, boron, in, 1841, swedish, chemist, carl, gustav, mosander, extracted, a, rare, earth, oxide, residue, he, called, didymium, from, a, residue, he, called, lanthana, in, turn, separated, from, cerium, salts, in, 1885, the, austrian, chemist, carl, auer, von, welsbach, separated, didymium, into, two, elements, that, gave, salts, of, different, colours, which, he, named, praseodymium, and, neodymium, the, name, praseodymium, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, prasinos, meaning, leek, green, and, didymos, twin, like, most, rare, earth, elements, praseodymium, most, readily, forms, the, 3, oxidation, state, which, is, the, only, stable, state, in, aqueous, solution, although, the, 4, oxidation, state, is, known, in, some, solid, compounds, and, uniquely, among, the, lanthanides, the, 5, oxidation, state, is, attainable, in, matrix, isolation, conditions, the, 0, 1, and, 2, oxidation, states, are, rarely, found, aqueous, praseodymium, ions, are, yellowish, green, and, similarly, praseodymium, results, in, various, shades, of, yellow, green, when, incorporated, into, glasses, many, of, praseodymium, s, industrial, uses, involve, its, ability, to, filter, yellow, light, from, light, sources, praseodymium, is, the, third, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, and, a, member, of, the, rare, earth, metals, in, the, periodic, table, it, appears, between, the, lanthanides, cerium, to, its, left, and, neodymium, to, its, right, and, above, the, actinide, protactinium, it, is, a, ductile, metal, with, a, hardness, comparable, to, that, of, silver, praseodymium, is, calculated, to, have, a, very, large, atomic, radius, with, a, radius, of, 247, pm, barium, rubidium, and, caesium, are, larger, however, observationally, it, is, usually, 185, pm, neutral, praseodymium, s, 59, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4f, 3, 6s, 2, like, most, other, lanthanides, praseodymium, usually, uses, only, three, electrons, as, valence, electrons, as, the, remaining, 4f, electrons, are, too, strongly, bound, to, engage, in, bonding, this, is, because, the, 4f, orbitals, penetrate, the, most, through, the, inert, xenon, core, of, electrons, to, the, nucleus, followed, by, 5d, and, 6s, and, this, penetration, increases, with, higher, ionic, charge, even, so, praseodymium, can, in, some, compounds, lose, a, fourth, valence, electron, because, it, is, early, in, the, lanthanide, series, where, the, nuclear, charge, is, still, low, enough, and, the, 4f, subshell, energy, high, enough, to, allow, the, removal, of, further, valence, electrons, similarly, to, the, other, early, lanthanides, praseodymium, has, a, double, hexagonal, close, packed, crystal, structure, at, room, temperature, called, the, alpha, phase, pr, at, 795, c, 1, 068, k, it, transforms, to, a, different, allotrope, that, has, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, pr, and, it, melts, at, 931, c, 1, 204, k, praseodymium, like, all, of, the, lanthanides, is, paramagnetic, at, room, temperature, unlike, some, other, rare, earth, metals, which, show, antiferromagnetic, or, ferromagnetic, ordering, at, low, temperatures, praseodymium, is, paramagnetic, at, all, temperatures, above, 1, k, praseodymium, metal, tarnishes, slowly, in, air, forming, a, spalling, green, oxide, layer, like, iron, rust, a, centimetre, sized, sample, of, praseodymium, metal, corrodes, completely, in, about, a, year, it, burns, readily, at, 150, c, to, form, praseodymium, iii, iv, oxide, a, nonstoichiometric, compound, approximating, to, pr, 6, o, 11, this, may, be, reduced, to, praseodymium, iii, oxide, pr, 2, o, 3, with, hydrogen, gas, praseodymium, iv, oxide, pro, 2, is, the, most, oxidised, product, of, the, combustion, of, praseodymium, and, can, be, obtained, by, either, reaction, of, praseodymium, metal, with, pure, oxygen, at, 400, c, and, 282, bar, or, by, disproportionation, of, pr, 6, o, 11, in, boiling, acetic, acid, the, reactivity, of, praseodymium, conforms, to, periodic, trends, as, it, is, one, of, the, first, and, thus, one, of, the, largest, lanthanides, at, 1000, c, many, praseodymium, oxides, with, composition, pro, 2, x, exist, as, disordered, nonstoichiometric, phases, with, 0, x, 0, 25, but, at, 400, 700, c, the, oxide, defects, are, instead, ordered, creating, phases, of, the, general, formula, pr, n, o, 2, n, 2, with, n, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and, these, phases, pro, y, are, sometimes, labelled, and, nonstoichiometric, y, 1, 833, 1, 818, 1, 8, 1, 778, 1, 714, and, praseodymium, is, an, electropositive, element, and, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quite, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, praseodymium, iii, hydroxide, praseodymium, metal, reacts, with, all, the, stable, halogens, to, form, trihalides, the, tetrafluoride, prf, 4, is, also, known, and, is, produced, by, reacting, a, mixture, of, sodium, fluoride, and, praseodymium, iii, fluoride, with, fluorine, gas, producing, na, 2, prf, 6, following, which, sodium, fluoride, is, removed, from, the, reaction, mixture, with, liquid, hydrogen, fluoride, additionally, praseodymium, forms, a, bronze, diiodide, like, the, diiodides, of, lanthanum, cerium, and, gadolinium, it, is, a, praseodymium, iii, electride, compound, praseodymium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, chartreuse, pr, 3, ions, which, exist, as, 3, complexes, dissolving, praseodymium, iv, compounds, in, water, does, not, result, in, solutions, containing, the, yellow, pr, 4, ions, because, of, the, high, positive, standard, reduction, potential, of, the, pr, 4, pr, 3, couple, at, 3, 2, v, these, ions, are, unstable, in, aqueous, solution, oxidising, water, and, being, reduced, to, pr, 3, the, value, for, the, pr, 3, pr, couple, is, 2, 35, v, however, in, highly, basic, aqueous, media, pr, 4, ions, can, be, generated, by, oxidation, with, ozone, although, praseodymium, v, in, the, bulk, state, is, unknown, the, existence, of, praseodymium, in, its, 5, oxidation, state, with, the, stable, electron, configuration, of, the, preceding, noble, gas, xenon, under, noble, gas, matrix, isolation, conditions, was, reported, in, 2016, the, species, assigned, to, the, 5, state, were, identified, as, its, o, 2, and, ar, adducts, and, pro, 2, 2, o, 2, organopraseodymium, compounds, are, very, similar, to, those, of, the, other, lanthanides, as, they, all, share, an, inability, to, undergo, backbonding, they, are, thus, mostly, restricted, to, the, mostly, ionic, cyclopentadienides, isostructural, with, those, of, lanthanum, and, the, bonded, simple, alkyls, and, aryls, some, of, which, may, be, polymeric, the, coordination, chemistry, of, praseodymium, is, largely, that, of, the, large, electropositive, pr, 3, ion, and, is, thus, largely, similar, to, those, of, the, other, early, lanthanides, la, 3, ce, 3, and, nd, 3, for, instance, like, lanthanum, cerium, and, neodymium, praseodymium, nitrates, form, both, 4, 3, and, 1, 1, complexes, with, 18, crown, 6, whereas, the, middle, lanthanides, from, promethium, to, gadolinium, can, only, form, the, 4, 3, complex, and, the, later, lanthanides, from, terbium, to, lutetium, cannot, successfully, coordinate, to, all, the, ligands, such, praseodymium, complexes, have, high, but, uncertain, coordination, numbers, and, poorly, defined, stereochemistry, with, exceptions, resulting, from, exceptionally, bulky, ligands, such, as, the, tricoordinate, there, are, also, a, few, mixed, oxides, and, fluorides, involving, praseodymium, iv, but, it, does, not, have, an, appreciable, coordination, chemistry, in, this, oxidation, state, like, its, neighbour, cerium, however, the, first, example, of, a, molecular, complex, of, praseodymium, iv, has, recently, been, reported, praseodymium, has, only, one, stable, and, naturally, occurring, isotope, 141, pr, it, is, thus, a, mononuclidic, and, monoisotopic, element, and, its, standard, atomic, weight, can, be, determined, with, high, precision, as, it, is, a, constant, of, nature, this, isotope, has, 82, neutrons, which, is, a, magic, number, that, confers, additional, stability, this, isotope, is, produced, in, stars, through, the, s, and, r, processes, slow, and, rapid, neutron, capture, respectively, thirty, eight, other, radioisotopes, have, been, synthesized, all, of, these, isotopes, have, half, lives, under, a, day, and, most, under, a, minute, with, the, single, exception, of, 143, pr, with, a, half, life, of, 13, 6, days, both, 143, pr, and, 141, pr, occur, as, fission, products, of, uranium, the, primary, decay, mode, of, isotopes, lighter, than, 141, pr, is, positron, emission, or, electron, capture, to, isotopes, of, cerium, while, that, of, heavier, isotopes, is, beta, decay, to, isotopes, of, neodymium, in, 1751, the, swedish, mineralogist, axel, fredrik, cronstedt, discovered, a, heavy, mineral, from, the, mine, at, bastn, s, later, named, cerite, thirty, years, later, the, fifteen, year, old, wilhelm, hisinger, from, the, family, owning, the, mine, sent, a, sample, of, it, to, carl, scheele, who, did, not, find, any, new, elements, within, in, 1803, after, hisinger, had, become, an, ironmaster, he, returned, to, the, mineral, with, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, and, isolated, a, new, oxide, which, they, named, ceria, after, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, which, had, been, discovered, two, years, earlier, ceria, was, simultaneously, and, independently, isolated, in, germany, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, between, 1839, and, 1843, ceria, was, shown, to, be, a, mixture, of, oxides, by, the, swedish, surgeon, and, chemist, carl, gustaf, mosander, who, lived, in, the, same, house, as, berzelius, he, separated, out, two, other, oxides, which, he, named, lanthana, and, didymia, he, partially, decomposed, a, sample, of, cerium, nitrate, by, roasting, it, in, air, and, then, treating, the, resulting, oxide, with, dilute, nitric, acid, the, metals, that, formed, these, oxides, were, thus, named, lanthanum, and, didymium, while, lanthanum, turned, out, to, be, a, pure, element, didymium, was, not, and, turned, out, to, be, only, a, mixture, of, all, the, stable, early, lanthanides, from, praseodymium, to, europium, as, had, been, suspected, by, marc, delafontaine, after, spectroscopic, analysis, though, he, lacked, the, time, to, pursue, its, separation, into, its, constituents, the, heavy, pair, of, samarium, and, europium, were, only, removed, in, 1879, by, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, and, it, was, not, until, 1885, that, carl, auer, von, welsbach, separated, didymium, into, praseodymium, and, neodymium, von, welsbach, confirmed, the, separation, by, spectroscopic, analysis, but, the, products, were, of, relatively, low, purity, since, neodymium, was, a, larger, constituent, of, didymium, than, praseodymium, it, kept, the, old, name, with, disambiguation, while, praseodymium, was, distinguished, by, the, leek, green, colour, of, its, salts, greek, leek, green, the, composite, nature, of, didymium, had, previously, been, suggested, in, 1882, by, bohuslav, brauner, who, did, not, experimentally, pursue, its, separation, praseodymium, is, not, particularly, rare, despite, it, being, in, the, rare, earth, metals, making, up, 9, 2, mg, kg, of, the, earth, s, crust, praseodymium, s, classification, as, a, rare, earth, metal, comes, from, its, rarity, relative, to, common, earths, such, as, lime, and, magnesia, the, few, known, minerals, containing, it, for, which, extraction, is, commercially, viable, as, well, as, the, length, and, complexity, of, extraction, although, not, particularly, rare, praseodymium, is, never, found, as, a, dominant, rare, earth, in, praseodymium, bearing, minerals, it, is, always, preceded, by, cerium, and, lanthanum, and, usually, also, by, neodymium, the, pr, 3, ion, is, similar, in, size, to, the, early, lanthanides, of, the, cerium, group, those, from, lanthanum, up, to, samarium, and, europium, that, immediately, follow, in, the, periodic, table, and, hence, it, tends, to, occur, along, with, them, in, phosphate, silicate, and, carbonate, minerals, such, as, monazite, m, iii, po, 4, and, bastn, site, m, iii, co, 3, f, where, m, refers, to, all, the, rare, earth, metals, except, scandium, and, the, radioactive, promethium, mostly, ce, la, and, y, with, somewhat, less, nd, and, pr, bastn, site, is, usually, lacking, in, thorium, and, the, heavy, lanthanides, and, the, purification, of, the, light, lanthanides, from, it, is, less, involved, the, ore, after, being, crushed, and, ground, is, first, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, evolving, carbon, dioxide, hydrogen, fluoride, and, silicon, tetrafluoride, the, product, is, then, dried, and, leached, with, water, leaving, the, early, lanthanide, ions, including, lanthanum, in, solution, the, procedure, for, monazite, which, usually, contains, all, the, rare, earth, as, well, as, thorium, is, more, involved, monazite, because, of, its, magnetic, properties, can, be, separated, by, repeated, electromagnetic, separation, after, separation, it, is, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, water, soluble, sulfates, of, rare, earth, the, acidic, filtrates, are, partially, neutralized, with, sodium, hydroxide, to, ph, 3, 4, during, which, thorium, precipitates, as, hydroxide, and, is, removed, the, solution, is, treated, with, ammonium, oxalate, to, convert, rare, earth, to, their, insoluble, oxalates, the, oxalates, are, converted, to, oxides, by, annealing, and, the, oxides, are, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, this, last, step, excludes, one, of, the, main, components, cerium, whose, oxide, is, insoluble, in, hno, 3, care, must, be, taken, when, handling, some, of, the, residues, as, they, contain, 228, ra, the, daughter, of, 232, th, which, is, a, strong, gamma, emitter, praseodymium, may, then, be, separated, from, the, other, lanthanides, via, ion, exchange, chromatography, or, by, using, a, solvent, such, as, tributyl, phosphate, where, the, solubility, of, ln, 3, increases, as, the, atomic, number, increases, if, ion, exchange, chromatography, is, used, the, mixture, of, lanthanides, is, loaded, into, one, column, of, cation, exchange, resin, and, cu, 2, or, zn, 2, or, fe, 3, is, loaded, into, the, other, an, aqueous, solution, of, a, complexing, agent, known, as, the, eluant, usually, triammonium, edtate, is, passed, through, the, columns, and, ln, 3, is, displaced, from, the, first, column, and, redeposited, in, a, compact, band, at, the, top, of, the, column, before, being, re, displaced, by, nh, 4, the, gibbs, free, energy, of, formation, for, ln, edta, h, complexes, increases, along, with, the, lanthanides, by, about, one, quarter, from, ce, 3, to, lu, 3, so, that, the, ln, 3, cations, descend, the, development, column, in, a, band, and, are, fractionated, repeatedly, eluting, from, heaviest, to, lightest, they, are, then, precipitated, as, their, insoluble, oxalates, burned, to, form, the, oxides, and, then, reduced, to, metals, leo, moser, not, to, be, confused, with, the, mathematician, of, the, same, name, son, of, ludwig, moser, founder, of, the, moser, glassworks, in, what, is, now, karlovy, vary, in, the, czech, republic, investigated, the, use, of, praseodymium, in, glass, coloration, in, the, late, 1920s, yielding, a, yellow, green, glass, given, the, name, prasemit, however, at, that, time, far, cheaper, colorants, could, give, a, similar, color, so, prasemit, was, not, popular, few, pieces, were, made, and, examples, are, now, extremely, rare, moser, also, blended, praseodymium, with, neodymium, to, produce, heliolite, glass, heliolit, in, german, which, was, more, widely, accepted, the, first, enduring, commercial, use, of, purified, praseodymium, which, continues, today, is, in, the, form, of, a, yellow, orange, praseodymium, yellow, stain, for, ceramics, which, is, a, solid, solution, in, the, zircon, lattice, this, stain, has, no, hint, of, green, in, it, by, contrast, at, sufficiently, high, loadings, praseodymium, glass, is, distinctly, green, rather, than, pure, yellow, like, many, other, lanthanides, praseodymium, s, shielded, f, orbitals, allow, for, long, excited, state, lifetimes, and, high, luminescence, yields, pr, 3, as, a, dopant, ion, therefore, sees, many, applications, in, optics, and, photonics, these, include, dpss, lasers, single, mode, fiber, optical, amplifiers, fiber, lasers, upconverting, nanoparticles, as, well, as, activators, in, red, green, blue, and, ultraviolet, phosphors, silicate, crystals, doped, with, praseodymium, ions, have, also, been, used, to, slow, a, light, pulse, down, to, a, few, hundred, meters, per, second, as, the, lanthanides, are, so, similar, praseodymium, can, substitute, for, most, other, lanthanides, without, significant, loss, of, function, and, indeed, many, applications, such, as, mischmetal, and, ferrocerium, alloys, involve, variable, mixes, of, several, lanthanides, including, small, quantities, of, praseodymium, the, following, more, modern, applications, involve, praseodymium, specifically, or, at, least, praseodymium, in, a, small, subset, of, the, lanthanides, due, to, its, role, in, permanent, magnets, used, for, wind, turbines, it, has, been, argued, that, praseodymium, will, be, one, of, the, main, objects, of, geopolitical, competition, in, a, world, running, on, renewable, energy, however, this, perspective, has, been, criticized, for, failing, to, recognize, that, most, wind, turbines, do, not, use, permanent, magnets, and, for, underestimating, the, power, of, economic, incentives, for, expanded, production, the, early, lanthanides, have, been, found, to, be, essential, to, some, methanotrophic, bacteria, living, in, volcanic, mudpots, such, as, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and, neodymium, are, about, equally, effective, praseodymium, is, otherwise, not, known, to, have, a, biological, role, in, any, other, organisms, but, it, is, not, very, toxic, either, intravenous, injection, of, rare, earths, into, animals, has, been, known, to, impair, liver, function, but, the, main, side, effects, from, inhalation, of, rare, earth, oxides, in, humans, come, from, radioactive, thorium, and, uranium, impurities
