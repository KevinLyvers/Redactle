a, mirage, is, a, naturally, occurring, optical, phenomenon, in, which, light, rays, bend, via, refraction, to, produce, a, displaced, image, of, distant, objects, or, the, sky, the, word, comes, to, english, via, the, french, se, mirer, from, the, latin, mirari, meaning, to, look, at, to, wonder, at, mirages, can, be, categorized, as, inferior, meaning, lower, superior, meaning, higher, and, fata, morgana, one, kind, of, superior, mirage, consisting, of, a, series, of, unusually, elaborate, vertically, stacked, images, which, form, one, rapidly, changing, mirage, in, contrast, to, a, hallucination, a, mirage, is, a, real, optical, phenomenon, that, can, be, captured, on, camera, since, light, rays, are, actually, refracted, to, form, the, false, image, at, the, observer, s, location, what, the, image, appears, to, represent, however, is, determined, by, the, interpretive, faculties, of, the, human, mind, for, example, inferior, images, on, land, are, very, easily, mistaken, for, the, reflections, from, a, small, body, of, water, in, an, inferior, mirage, the, mirage, image, appears, below, the, real, object, the, real, object, in, an, inferior, mirage, is, the, blue, sky, or, any, distant, therefore, bluish, object, in, that, same, direction, the, mirage, causes, the, observer, to, see, a, bright, and, bluish, patch, on, the, ground, light, rays, coming, from, a, particular, distant, object, all, travel, through, nearly, the, same, layers, of, air, and, all, are, refracted, at, about, the, same, angle, therefore, rays, coming, from, the, top, of, the, object, will, arrive, lower, than, those, from, the, bottom, the, image, is, usually, upside, down, enhancing, the, illusion, that, the, sky, image, seen, in, the, distance, is, a, specular, reflection, on, a, puddle, of, water, or, oil, acting, as, a, mirror, while, the, aero, dynamics, are, highly, active, the, image, of, the, inferior, mirage, is, stable, unlike, the, fata, morgana, which, can, change, within, seconds, since, warmer, air, rises, while, cooler, air, being, denser, sinks, the, layers, will, mix, causing, turbulence, the, image, will, be, distorted, accordingly, it, may, vibrate, or, be, stretched, vertically, towering, or, compressed, vertically, stooping, a, combination, of, vibration, and, extension, are, also, possible, if, several, temperature, layers, are, present, several, mirages, may, mix, perhaps, causing, double, images, in, any, case, mirages, are, usually, not, larger, than, about, half, a, degree, high, roughly, the, angular, diameter, of, the, sun, and, moon, and, are, from, objects, between, dozens, of, meters, and, a, few, kilometers, away, heat, haze, also, called, heat, shimmer, refers, to, the, inferior, mirage, observed, when, viewing, objects, through, a, mass, of, heated, air, common, instances, when, heat, haze, occurs, include, images, of, objects, viewed, across, asphalt, concrete, also, known, as, tarmac, roads, and, over, masonry, rooftops, on, hot, days, above, and, behind, fire, as, in, burning, candles, patio, heaters, and, campfires, and, through, exhaust, gases, from, jet, engines, when, appearing, on, roads, due, to, the, hot, asphalt, it, is, often, referred, to, as, a, highway, mirage, it, also, occurs, in, deserts, in, that, case, it, is, referred, to, as, a, desert, mirage, both, tarmac, and, sand, can, become, very, hot, when, exposed, to, the, sun, easily, being, more, than, 10, c, 18, f, higher, than, the, air, a, meter, 3, 3, feet, above, enough, to, make, conditions, suitable, to, cause, the, mirage, convection, causes, the, temperature, of, the, air, to, vary, and, the, variation, between, the, hot, air, at, the, surface, of, the, road, and, the, denser, cool, air, above, it, causes, a, gradient, in, the, refractive, index, of, the, air, this, produces, a, blurred, shimmering, effect, which, hinders, the, ability, to, resolve, the, image, and, increases, when, the, image, is, magnified, through, a, telescope, or, telephoto, lens, light, from, the, sky, at, a, shallow, angle, to, the, road, is, refracted, by, the, index, gradient, making, it, appear, as, if, the, sky, is, reflected, by, the, road, s, surface, this, might, appear, as, a, pool, of, liquid, usually, water, but, possibly, others, such, as, oil, on, the, road, as, some, types, of, liquid, also, reflect, the, sky, the, illusion, moves, into, the, distance, as, the, observer, approaches, the, miraged, object, giving, one, the, same, effect, as, approaching, a, rainbow, heat, haze, is, not, related, to, the, atmospheric, phenomenon, of, haze, a, superior, mirage, is, one, in, which, the, mirage, image, appears, to, be, located, above, the, real, object, a, superior, mirage, occurs, when, the, air, below, the, line, of, sight, is, colder, than, the, air, above, it, this, unusual, arrangement, is, called, a, temperature, inversion, during, daytime, the, normal, temperature, gradient, of, the, atmosphere, is, cold, air, above, warm, air, passing, through, the, temperature, inversion, the, light, rays, are, bent, down, and, so, the, image, appears, above, the, true, object, hence, the, name, superior, superior, mirages, are, quite, common, in, polar, regions, especially, over, large, sheets, of, ice, that, have, a, uniform, low, temperature, superior, mirages, also, occur, at, more, moderate, latitudes, although, in, those, cases, they, are, weaker, and, tend, to, be, less, smooth, and, stable, for, example, a, distant, shoreline, may, appear, to, tower, and, look, higher, and, thus, perhaps, closer, than, it, really, is, because, of, the, turbulence, there, appear, to, be, dancing, spikes, and, towers, this, type, of, mirage, is, also, called, the, fata, morgana, or, hafger, ingar, in, the, icelandic, language, a, superior, mirage, can, be, right, side, up, or, upside, down, depending, on, the, distance, of, the, true, object, and, the, temperature, gradient, often, the, image, appears, as, a, distorted, mixture, of, up, and, down, parts, since, the, earth, is, round, if, the, downward, bending, curvature, of, light, rays, is, about, the, same, as, the, curvature, of, earth, light, rays, can, travel, large, distances, including, from, beyond, the, horizon, this, was, observed, and, documented, in, 1596, when, a, ship, in, search, of, the, northeast, passage, became, stuck, in, the, ice, at, novaya, zemlya, above, the, arctic, circle, the, sun, appeared, to, rise, two, weeks, earlier, than, expected, the, real, sun, had, still, been, below, the, horizon, but, its, light, rays, followed, the, curvature, of, earth, this, effect, is, often, called, a, novaya, zemlya, mirage, for, every, 111, 12, kilometres, 69, 05, mi, that, light, rays, travel, parallel, to, earth, s, surface, the, sun, will, appear, 1, higher, on, the, horizon, the, inversion, layer, must, have, just, the, right, temperature, gradient, over, the, whole, distance, to, make, this, possible, in, the, same, way, ships, that, are, so, far, away, that, they, should, not, be, visible, above, the, geometric, horizon, may, appear, on, or, even, above, the, horizon, as, superior, mirages, this, may, explain, some, stories, about, flying, ships, or, coastal, cities, in, the, sky, as, described, by, some, polar, explorers, these, are, examples, of, so, called, arctic, mirages, or, hillingar, in, icelandic, if, the, vertical, temperature, gradient, is, 12, 9, c, 23, 2, f, per, 100, meters, 330, feet, where, the, positive, sign, means, the, temperature, increases, at, higher, altitudes, then, horizontal, light, rays, will, just, follow, the, curvature, of, earth, and, the, horizon, will, appear, flat, if, the, gradient, is, less, as, it, almost, always, is, the, rays, are, not, bent, enough, and, get, lost, in, space, which, is, the, normal, situation, of, a, spherical, convex, horizon, in, some, situations, distant, objects, can, be, elevated, or, lowered, stretched, or, shortened, with, no, mirage, involved, a, fata, morgana, the, name, comes, from, the, italian, translation, of, morgan, le, fay, the, fairy, shapeshifting, half, sister, of, king, arthur, is, a, very, complex, superior, mirage, it, appears, with, alternations, of, compressed, and, stretched, areas, erect, images, and, inverted, images, a, fata, morgana, is, also, a, fast, changing, mirage, fata, morgana, mirages, are, most, common, in, polar, regions, especially, over, large, sheets, of, ice, with, a, uniform, low, temperature, but, they, can, be, observed, almost, anywhere, in, polar, regions, a, fata, morgana, may, be, observed, on, cold, days, in, desert, areas, and, over, oceans, and, lakes, a, fata, morgana, may, be, observed, on, hot, days, for, a, fata, morgana, temperature, inversion, has, to, be, strong, enough, that, light, rays, curvatures, within, the, inversion, are, stronger, than, the, curvature, of, earth, the, rays, will, bend, and, form, arcs, an, observer, needs, to, be, within, an, atmospheric, duct, to, be, able, to, see, a, fata, morgana, fata, morgana, mirages, may, be, observed, from, any, altitude, within, earth, s, atmosphere, including, from, mountaintops, or, airplanes, distortions, of, image, and, bending, of, light, can, produce, spectacular, effects, in, his, book, pursuit, the, chase, and, sinking, of, the, bismarck, ludovic, kennedy, describes, an, incident, that, allegedly, took, place, below, the, denmark, strait, during, 1941, following, the, sinking, of, the, hood, the, bismarck, while, pursued, by, the, british, cruisers, norfolk, and, suffolk, passed, out, of, sight, into, a, sea, mist, within, a, matter, of, seconds, the, ship, re, appeared, steaming, toward, the, british, ships, at, high, speed, in, alarm, the, cruisers, separated, anticipating, an, imminent, attack, and, observers, from, both, ships, watched, in, astonishment, as, the, german, battleship, fluttered, grew, indistinct, and, faded, away, radar, watch, during, these, events, indicated, that, the, bismarck, had, in, fact, made, no, change, to, her, course, the, conditions, for, producing, a, mirage, can, occur, at, night, as, well, as, during, the, day, under, some, circumstances, mirages, of, astronomical, objects, and, mirages, of, lights, from, moving, vehicles, aircraft, ships, buildings, etc, can, be, observed, at, night, a, mirage, of, an, astronomical, object, is, a, naturally, occurring, optical, phenomenon, in, which, light, rays, are, bent, to, produce, distorted, or, multiple, images, of, an, astronomical, object, mirages, can, be, observed, for, such, astronomical, objects, as, the, sun, the, moon, the, planets, bright, stars, and, very, bright, comets, the, most, commonly, observed, are, sunset, and, sunrise, mirages
