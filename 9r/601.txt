bauxite, b, k, s, a, t, is, a, sedimentary, rock, with, a, relatively, high, aluminium, content, it, is, the, world, s, main, source, of, aluminium, and, gallium, bauxite, consists, mostly, of, the, aluminium, minerals, gibbsite, al, oh, 3, boehmite, alo, oh, and, diaspore, alo, oh, mixed, with, the, two, iron, oxides, goethite, feo, oh, and, haematite, fe, 2, o, 3, the, aluminium, clay, mineral, kaolinite, al, 2, si, 2, o, 5, oh, 4, and, small, amounts, of, anatase, tio, 2, and, ilmenite, fetio, 3, or, feo, tio, 2, bauxite, appears, dull, in, luster, and, is, reddish, brown, white, or, tan, in, 1821, the, french, geologist, pierre, berthier, discovered, bauxite, near, the, village, of, les, baux, in, provence, southern, france, bauxite, extraction, and, refining, has, numerous, negative, consequences, to, the, environment, and, to, people, the, negative, impacts, are, well, documented, and, there, are, many, examples, from, all, over, the, world, these, impacts, include, the, destruction, of, the, environment, water, and, air, soil, pollution, and, soil, degradation, numerous, classification, schemes, have, been, proposed, for, bauxite, but, as, of, 1982, there, was, no, consensus, vad, sz, 1951, distinguished, lateritic, bauxites, silicate, bauxites, from, karst, bauxite, ores, carbonate, bauxites, in, the, case, of, jamaica, recent, analysis, of, the, soils, showed, elevated, levels, of, cadmium, suggesting, that, the, bauxite, originates, from, miocene, volcanic, ash, deposits, from, episodes, of, significant, volcanism, in, central, america, australia, is, the, largest, producer, of, bauxite, followed, by, guinea, and, china, bauxite, is, usually, strip, mined, because, it, is, almost, always, found, near, the, surface, of, the, terrain, with, little, or, no, overburden, increased, aluminium, recycling, which, requires, less, electric, power, than, producing, aluminium, from, ores, may, considerably, extend, the, world, s, bauxite, reserves, as, of, 2010, approximately, 70, to, 80, of, the, world, s, dry, bauxite, production, is, processed, first, into, alumina, and, then, into, aluminium, by, electrolysis, bauxite, rocks, are, typically, classified, according, to, their, intended, commercial, application, metallurgical, abrasive, cement, chemical, and, refractory, bauxite, ore, is, usually, heated, in, a, pressure, vessel, along, with, a, sodium, hydroxide, solution, at, a, temperature, of, 150, to, 200, c, 300, to, 390, f, at, these, temperatures, the, aluminium, is, dissolved, as, sodium, aluminate, the, bayer, process, the, aluminium, compounds, in, the, bauxite, may, be, present, as, gibbsite, al, oh, 3, boehmite, alooh, or, diaspore, alooh, the, different, forms, of, the, aluminium, component, will, dictate, the, extraction, conditions, the, undissolved, waste, bauxite, tailings, after, the, aluminium, compounds, are, extracted, contains, iron, oxides, silica, calcia, titania, and, some, un, reacted, alumina, after, separation, of, the, residue, by, filtering, pure, gibbsite, is, precipitated, when, the, liquid, is, cooled, and, then, seeded, with, fine, grained, aluminium, hydroxide, the, gibbsite, is, usually, converted, into, aluminium, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, by, heating, in, rotary, kilns, or, fluid, flash, calciners, to, a, temperature, in, excess, of, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, this, aluminium, oxide, is, dissolved, at, a, temperature, of, about, 960, c, 1, 760, f, in, molten, cryolite, next, this, molten, substance, can, yield, metallic, aluminium, by, passing, an, electric, current, through, it, in, the, process, of, electrolysis, which, is, called, the, hall, h, roult, process, named, after, its, american, and, french, discoverers, prior, to, the, invention, of, this, process, and, prior, to, the, deville, process, aluminium, ore, was, refined, by, heating, ore, along, with, elemental, sodium, or, potassium, in, a, vacuum, the, method, was, complicated, and, consumed, materials, that, were, themselves, expensive, at, that, time, this, made, early, elemental, aluminium, more, expensive, than, gold, as, a, bulk, cargo, bauxite, is, a, group, a, cargo, that, may, liquefy, if, excessively, moist, liquefaction, and, the, free, surface, effect, can, cause, the, cargo, to, shift, rapidly, inside, the, hold, and, make, the, ship, unstable, potentially, sinking, the, ship, one, vessel, suspected, to, have, been, sunk, in, this, way, was, the, ms, bulk, jupiter, in, 2015, one, method, which, can, demonstrate, this, effect, is, the, can, test, in, which, a, sample, of, the, material, is, placed, in, a, cylindrical, can, and, struck, against, a, surface, many, times, if, a, moist, slurry, forms, in, the, can, then, there, is, a, likelihood, for, the, cargo, to, liquefy, although, conversely, even, if, the, sample, remains, dry, it, does, not, conclusively, prove, that, it, will, remain, that, way, or, that, it, is, safe, for, loading, bauxite, is, the, main, source, of, the, rare, metal, gallium, during, the, processing, of, bauxite, to, alumina, in, the, bayer, process, gallium, accumulates, in, the, sodium, hydroxide, liquor, from, this, it, can, be, extracted, by, a, variety, of, methods, the, most, recent, is, the, use, of, ion, exchange, resin, achievable, extraction, efficiencies, critically, depend, on, the, original, concentration, in, the, feed, bauxite, at, a, typical, feed, concentration, of, 50, ppm, about, 15, percent, of, the, contained, gallium, is, extractable, the, remainder, reports, to, the, red, mud, and, aluminium, hydroxide, streams, bauxite, is, also, a, potential, source, for, vanadium, the, social, and, environmental, impacts, of, bauxite, extraction, are, well, documented, most, of, the, world, s, bauxite, deposits, can, be, found, within, 1, to, 20, metres, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 65, ft, 7, in, of, the, earths, surface, strip, mining, is, the, most, common, technique, used, for, extracting, shallow, bauxite, this, process, involves, removing, the, vegetation, top, soil, and, overburden, to, expose, the, bauxite, ore, the, overlying, soil, is, typically, stockpiled, in, order, to, rehabilitate, the, mine, once, operations, have, finished, during, the, strip, mining, process, the, biodiversity, and, habitat, once, present, in, the, area, is, completely, lost, and, the, hydrological, and, soil, characteristics, in, the, region, are, permanently, altered, other, environmental, impacts, of, bauxite, mining, include, soil, degradation, air, pollution, and, water, pollution, red, mud, is, a, highly, alkaline, sludge, with, a, high, ph, around, 13, that, is, a, byproduct, of, the, bayer, process, it, contains, several, elements, such, as, sodium, aluminoscilicate, calcium, titanate, monohydrate, aluminium, and, trihydrate, aluminium, that, do, not, break, down, in, nature, when, improperly, stored, red, mud, can, contaminate, soil, and, water, which, can, result, in, local, extinction, of, all, life, red, mud, was, responsible, for, killing, all, life, in, the, marcal, river, in, hungary, after, a, spill, occurred, in, 2010, when, red, mud, dries, it, turns, into, dust, that, can, cause, lung, disease, cancer, and, birth, defects, in, the, tropical, regions, of, asia, central, africa, south, america, and, northern, australia, there, has, been, an, increase, of, bauxite, mines, on, traditional, and, indigenous, lands, this, has, resulted, in, a, number, of, negative, social, impacts, on, local, and, indigenous, peoples, in, the, bok, region, of, guinea, there, has, been, a, significant, increase, in, bauxite, mining, pressure, on, the, local, population, this, has, resulted, in, potable, water, issues, air, pollution, food, contamination, and, land, expropriation, disputes, due, to, improper, compensation, bauxite, mining, has, led, to, protests, civil, unrest, and, violent, conflicts, in, guinea, ghana, vietnam, and, india, guinea, has, a, long, history, of, mining, related, conflicts, between, communities, and, mining, companies, between, 2015, and, 2018, new, bauxite, mining, operations, in, the, bok, region, of, guinea, have, caused, in, 35, conflicts, which, include, movements, of, revolts, and, road, blockades, these, conflicts, have, resulted, in, the, loss, of, human, life, the, destruction, of, heavy, machinery, and, damage, to, government, buildings, the, atewa, range, in, ghana, classified, as, an, ecologically, important, forest, reserve, with, an, area, of, 17, 400, hectares, 43, 000, acres, has, been, is, a, recent, site, of, conflict, and, controversy, surrounding, baxuite, mining, the, forest, reserve, is, one, of, the, only, two, upland, evergreen, forests, in, ghana, and, makes, up, a, significant, portion, of, the, remaining, 20, of, forested, habitat, left, in, ghana, the, atewa, range, falls, under, the, jurisdiction, of, akyem, abuakwa, traditional, area, and, is, overseen, by, the, king, known, as, okyenhene, in, 2013, an, ngo, called, a, rocha, ghana, held, a, summit, with, the, forestry, and, water, resource, commission, the, minister, of, lands, the, minister, of, the, environment, and, other, important, stakeholders, they, came, to, the, conclusion, that, no, future, government, should, mine, bauxite, in, the, region, because, the, reserve, is, environmentally, and, culturally, significant, in, 2016, the, government, along, with, ngo, s, began, the, process, of, upgrading, the, reserved, to, a, national, park, however, that, year, an, election, took, place, and, before, it, became, official, the, newly, elected, national, patriotic, party, npp, rejected, the, plan, in, 2017, the, government, of, ghana, signed, a, memorandum, of, understanding, with, china, to, develop, new, bauxite, mining, infrastructure, in, ghana, although, there, was, no, official, plan, to, mine, the, atewa, forest, reserve, tensions, between, local, communities, ngo, and, the, government, began, to, rise, in, 2019, tensions, began, to, reach, a, peak, when, the, government, presented, the, ghana, integrated, bauxite, and, aluminium, development, authority, act, that, would, create, the, legal, framework, required, to, develop, and, establish, an, integrated, bauxite, industry, in, may, of, that, year, the, government, began, drilling, deep, holes, in, the, reserve, these, actions, sparked, several, protests, including, a, 95, kilometre, 59, mi, march, from, the, reserve, to, the, presidential, palace, an, informational, billboard, campaign, led, by, a, rocha, ghana, and, a, youth, march, in, 2020, a, rocha, ghana, also, sued, the, government, over, the, drilling, in, the, reserve, after, they, failed, to, provide, a, statement, explaining, their, actions, in, early, 2009, the, vietnamese, government, proposed, a, plan, to, mine, remote, regions, of, the, central, highlands, this, proposal, was, highly, controversial, and, sparked, a, nationwide, debate, and, the, most, significant, domestic, conflict, since, the, vietnam, war, government, scientists, journalists, religious, leaders, retired, high, level, state, officials, and, general, v, nguy, n, gi, p, the, military, leader, of, anti, colonial, revolution, were, among, the, many, people, across, vietnamese, society, who, opposed, the, governments, plans, in, an, attempt, to, stop, the, spread, of, information, across, the, globe, the, government, banned, domestic, reporters, from, reporting, on, bauxite, mining, however, reporters, turned, to, vietnamese, language, websites, and, blogs, where, the, reporting, and, discussion, continued, on, april, 12, 2009, several, well, respected, vietnamese, scholars, started, a, petition, against, the, mining, of, bauxite, that, was, signed, by, 135, accomplished, and, well, known, intellectuals, this, petition, helped, unite, the, scattered, anti, bauxite, movement, into, a, unified, opposition, against, the, state, these, acts, of, governmental, defiance, were, met, with, repressive, state, actions, many, domestic, online, reporters, were, arrested, and, legislative, action, was, taken, to, repress, scientific, research, most, of, india, s, bauxite, ore, reserves, which, are, among, the, top, ten, largest, in, the, world, are, located, on, tribal, land, these, tribal, lands, are, densely, populated, and, home, to, over, 100, million, indigenous, indian, peoples, the, mountain, summits, located, on, these, lands, act, as, a, source, of, water, and, greatly, contribute, to, the, regions, fertility, the, indian, bauxite, industry, is, interested, in, developing, this, land, for, aluminum, production, which, poses, great, risk, to, the, terrestrial, and, aquatic, ecosystems, historically, the, indigenous, peoples, living, on, these, lands, have, shown, resistance, to, development, and, oppose, any, new, bauxite, mining, projects, in, the, area, this, has, led, to, violent, conflicts, between, indigenous, communities, and, police, on, december, 16, 2000, police, killed, three, indigenous, protestors, and, wounded, over, a, dozen, more, during, a, protest, over, a, bauxite, project, in, the, rayagada, district, of, odisha
