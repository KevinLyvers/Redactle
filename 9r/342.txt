hydrogen, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, h, and, atomic, number, 1, it, is, the, lightest, element, and, at, standard, conditions, is, a, gas, of, diatomic, molecules, with, the, formula, h, 2, sometimes, called, dihydrogen, but, more, commonly, called, hydrogen, gas, molecular, hydrogen, or, simply, hydrogen, it, is, colorless, odorless, non, toxic, and, highly, combustible, constituting, about, 75, of, all, normal, matter, hydrogen, is, the, most, abundant, chemical, element, in, the, universe, stars, including, the, sun, mainly, consist, of, hydrogen, in, a, plasma, state, while, on, earth, hydrogen, is, found, in, water, organic, compounds, as, dihydrogen, and, in, other, molecular, forms, the, most, common, isotope, of, hydrogen, protium, 1, h, consists, of, one, proton, one, electron, and, no, neutrons, in, the, early, universe, the, formation, of, hydrogen, s, protons, occurred, in, the, first, second, after, the, big, bang, neutral, hydrogen, atoms, only, formed, about, 370, 000, years, later, during, the, recombination, epoch, as, the, universe, cooled, and, plasma, had, cooled, enough, for, electrons, to, remain, bound, to, protons, hydrogen, typically, nonmetallic, except, under, extreme, pressure, readily, forms, covalent, bonds, with, most, nonmetals, contributing, to, the, formation, of, compounds, like, water, and, various, organic, substances, its, role, is, crucial, in, acid, base, reactions, which, mainly, involve, proton, exchange, among, soluble, molecules, in, ionic, compounds, hydrogen, can, take, the, form, of, either, a, negatively, charged, anion, where, it, is, known, as, hydride, or, as, a, positively, charged, cation, h, the, cation, usually, just, a, proton, symbol, p, exhibits, specific, behavior, in, aqueous, solutions, and, in, ionic, compounds, involves, screening, of, its, electric, charge, by, surrounding, polar, molecules, or, anions, hydrogen, s, unique, position, as, the, only, neutral, atom, for, which, the, schr, dinger, equation, can, be, directly, solved, has, significantly, contributed, to, the, foundational, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, through, the, exploration, of, its, energetics, and, chemical, bonding, hydrogen, gas, was, first, produced, artificially, in, the, early, 16th, century, by, reacting, acids, with, metals, henry, cavendish, in, 1766, 81, identified, hydrogen, gas, as, a, distinct, substance, and, discovered, its, property, of, producing, water, when, burned, hence, its, name, means, water, former, in, greek, most, hydrogen, production, occurs, through, steam, reforming, of, natural, gas, a, smaller, portion, comes, from, energy, intensive, methods, such, as, the, electrolysis, of, water, its, main, industrial, uses, include, fossil, fuel, processing, such, as, hydrocracking, and, ammonia, production, with, emerging, uses, in, fuel, cells, for, electricity, generation, and, as, a, heat, source, when, used, in, fuel, cells, hydrogen, s, only, emission, at, point, of, use, is, water, vapor, though, combustion, can, produce, nitrogen, oxides, hydrogen, s, interaction, with, metals, may, cause, embrittlement, hydrogen, gas, is, highly, flammable, enthalpy, of, combustion, 286, kj, mol, hydrogen, gas, forms, explosive, mixtures, with, air, in, concentrations, from, 4, 74, and, with, chlorine, at, 5, 95, the, hydrogen, autoignition, temperature, the, temperature, of, spontaneous, ignition, in, air, is, 500, c, 932, f, pure, hydrogen, oxygen, flames, emit, ultraviolet, light, and, with, high, oxygen, mix, are, nearly, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, as, illustrated, by, the, faint, plume, of, the, space, shuttle, main, engine, compared, to, the, highly, visible, plume, of, a, space, shuttle, solid, rocket, booster, which, uses, an, ammonium, perchlorate, composite, the, detection, of, a, burning, hydrogen, leak, may, require, a, flame, detector, such, leaks, can, be, very, dangerous, hydrogen, flames, in, other, conditions, are, blue, resembling, blue, natural, gas, flames, the, destruction, of, the, hindenburg, airship, was, a, notorious, example, of, hydrogen, combustion, and, the, cause, is, still, debated, the, visible, flames, in, the, photographs, were, the, result, of, carbon, compounds, in, the, airship, skin, burning, h, 2, is, unreactive, compared, to, diatomic, elements, such, as, halogens, or, oxygen, the, thermodynamic, basis, of, this, low, reactivity, is, the, very, strong, h, h, bond, with, a, bond, dissociation, energy, of, 435, 7, kj, mol, the, kinetic, basis, of, the, low, reactivity, is, the, nonpolar, nature, of, h, 2, and, its, weak, polarizability, it, spontaneously, reacts, with, chlorine, and, fluorine, to, form, hydrogen, chloride, and, hydrogen, fluoride, respectively, the, reactivity, of, h, 2, is, strongly, affected, by, the, presence, of, metal, catalysts, thus, while, mixtures, of, h, 2, with, o, 2, or, air, combust, readily, when, heated, to, at, least, 500, c, by, a, spark, or, flame, they, do, not, react, at, room, temperature, in, the, absence, of, a, catalyst, the, ground, state, energy, level, of, the, electron, in, a, hydrogen, atom, is, 13, 6, ev, equivalent, to, an, ultraviolet, photon, of, roughly, 91, nm, wavelength, the, energy, levels, of, hydrogen, can, be, calculated, fairly, accurately, using, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, in, which, the, electron, orbits, the, proton, like, how, earth, orbits, the, sun, however, the, electron, and, proton, are, held, together, by, electrostatic, attraction, while, planets, and, celestial, objects, are, held, by, gravity, due, to, the, discretization, of, angular, momentum, postulated, in, early, quantum, mechanics, by, bohr, the, electron, in, the, bohr, model, can, only, occupy, certain, allowed, distances, from, the, proton, and, therefore, only, certain, allowed, energies, a, more, accurate, description, of, the, hydrogen, atom, comes, from, a, quantum, analysis, that, uses, the, schr, dinger, equation, dirac, equation, or, feynman, path, integral, formulation, to, calculate, the, probability, density, of, the, electron, around, the, proton, the, most, complex, formulas, include, the, small, effects, of, special, relativity, and, vacuum, polarization, in, the, quantum, mechanical, treatment, the, electron, in, a, ground, state, hydrogen, atom, has, no, angular, momentum, illustrating, how, the, planetary, orbit, differs, from, electron, motion, molecular, h, 2, exists, as, two, spin, isomers, i, e, compounds, that, differ, only, in, the, spin, states, of, their, nuclei, in, the, orthohydrogen, form, the, spins, of, the, two, nuclei, are, parallel, forming, a, spin, triplet, state, having, a, total, molecular, spin, s, 1, displaystyle, s, 1, in, the, parahydrogen, form, the, spins, are, antiparallel, and, form, a, spin, singlet, state, having, spin, s, 0, displaystyle, s, 0, the, equilibrium, ratio, of, ortho, to, para, hydrogen, depends, on, temperature, at, room, temperature, or, warmer, equilibrium, hydrogen, gas, contains, about, 25, of, the, para, form, and, 75, of, the, ortho, form, the, ortho, form, is, an, excited, state, having, higher, energy, than, the, para, form, by, 1, 455, kj, mol, and, it, converts, to, the, para, form, over, the, course, of, several, minutes, when, cooled, to, low, temperature, the, thermal, properties, of, the, forms, differ, because, they, differ, in, their, allowed, rotational, quantum, states, resulting, in, different, thermal, properties, such, as, the, heat, capacity, the, ortho, to, para, ratio, in, h, 2, is, an, important, consideration, in, the, liquefaction, and, storage, of, liquid, hydrogen, the, conversion, from, ortho, to, para, is, exothermic, and, produces, enough, heat, to, evaporate, most, of, the, liquid, if, not, converted, first, to, parahydrogen, during, the, cooling, process, catalysts, for, the, ortho, para, interconversion, such, as, ferric, oxide, and, activated, carbon, compounds, are, used, during, hydrogen, cooling, to, avoid, this, loss, of, liquid, while, h, 2, is, not, very, reactive, under, standard, conditions, it, does, form, compounds, with, most, elements, hydrogen, can, form, compounds, with, elements, that, are, more, electronegative, such, as, halogens, f, cl, br, i, or, oxygen, in, these, compounds, hydrogen, takes, on, a, partial, positive, charge, when, bonded, to, a, more, electronegative, element, particularly, fluorine, oxygen, or, nitrogen, hydrogen, can, participate, in, a, form, of, medium, strength, noncovalent, bonding, with, another, electronegative, element, with, a, lone, pair, a, phenomenon, called, hydrogen, bonding, that, is, critical, to, the, stability, of, many, biological, molecules, hydrogen, also, forms, compounds, with, less, electronegative, elements, such, as, metals, and, metalloids, where, it, takes, on, a, partial, negative, charge, these, compounds, are, often, known, as, hydrides, hydrogen, forms, many, compounds, with, carbon, called, the, hydrocarbons, and, even, more, with, heteroatoms, that, due, to, their, association, with, living, things, are, called, organic, compounds, the, study, of, their, properties, is, known, as, organic, chemistry, and, their, study, in, the, context, of, living, organisms, is, called, biochemistry, by, some, definitions, organic, compounds, are, only, required, to, contain, carbon, however, most, of, them, also, contain, hydrogen, and, because, it, is, the, carbon, hydrogen, bond, that, gives, this, class, of, compounds, most, of, its, particular, chemical, characteristics, carbon, hydrogen, bonds, are, required, in, some, definitions, of, the, word, organic, in, chemistry, millions, of, hydrocarbons, are, known, and, they, are, usually, formed, by, complicated, pathways, that, seldom, involve, elemental, hydrogen, hydrogen, is, highly, soluble, in, many, rare, earth, and, transition, metals, and, is, soluble, in, both, nanocrystalline, and, amorphous, metals, hydrogen, solubility, in, metals, is, influenced, by, local, distortions, or, impurities, in, the, crystal, lattice, these, properties, may, be, useful, when, hydrogen, is, purified, by, passage, through, hot, palladium, disks, but, the, gas, s, high, solubility, is, a, metallurgical, problem, contributing, to, the, embrittlement, of, many, metals, complicating, the, design, of, pipelines, and, storage, tanks, hydrogen, compounds, are, often, called, hydrides, a, term, that, is, used, fairly, loosely, the, term, hydride, suggests, that, the, h, atom, has, acquired, a, negative, or, anionic, character, denoted, h, and, is, used, when, hydrogen, forms, a, compound, with, a, more, electropositive, element, the, existence, of, the, hydride, anion, suggested, by, gilbert, n, lewis, in, 1916, for, group, 1, and, 2, salt, like, hydrides, was, demonstrated, by, moers, in, 1920, by, the, electrolysis, of, molten, lithium, hydride, lih, producing, a, stoichiometric, quantity, of, hydrogen, at, the, anode, for, hydrides, other, than, group, 1, and, 2, metals, the, term, is, quite, misleading, considering, the, low, electronegativity, of, hydrogen, an, exception, in, group, 2, hydrides, is, beh, 2, which, is, polymeric, in, lithium, aluminium, hydride, the, anion, carries, hydridic, centers, firmly, attached, to, the, al, iii, although, hydrides, can, be, formed, with, almost, all, main, group, elements, the, number, and, combination, of, possible, compounds, varies, widely, for, example, more, than, 100, binary, borane, hydrides, are, known, but, only, one, binary, aluminium, hydride, binary, indium, hydride, has, not, yet, been, identified, although, larger, complexes, exist, in, inorganic, chemistry, hydrides, can, also, serve, as, bridging, ligands, that, link, two, metal, centers, in, a, coordination, complex, this, function, is, particularly, common, in, group, 13, elements, especially, in, boranes, boron, hydrides, and, aluminium, complexes, as, well, as, in, clustered, carboranes, oxidation, of, hydrogen, removes, its, electron, and, gives, h, which, contains, no, electrons, and, a, nucleus, which, is, usually, composed, of, one, proton, that, is, why, h, is, often, called, a, proton, this, species, is, central, to, discussion, of, acids, under, the, br, nsted, lowry, acid, base, theory, acids, are, proton, donors, while, bases, are, proton, acceptors, a, bare, proton, h, cannot, exist, in, solution, or, in, ionic, crystals, because, of, its, strong, attraction, to, other, atoms, or, molecules, with, electrons, except, at, the, high, temperatures, associated, with, plasmas, such, protons, cannot, be, removed, from, the, electron, clouds, of, atoms, and, molecules, and, will, remain, attached, to, them, however, the, term, proton, is, sometimes, used, loosely, and, metaphorically, to, refer, to, positively, charged, or, cationic, hydrogen, attached, to, other, species, in, this, fashion, and, as, such, is, denoted, h, without, any, implication, that, any, single, protons, exist, freely, as, a, species, to, avoid, the, implication, of, the, naked, solvated, proton, in, solution, acidic, aqueous, solutions, are, sometimes, considered, to, contain, a, less, unlikely, fictitious, species, termed, the, hydronium, ion, however, even, in, this, case, such, solvated, hydrogen, cations, are, more, realistically, conceived, as, being, organized, into, clusters, that, form, species, closer, to, other, oxonium, ions, are, found, when, water, is, in, acidic, solution, with, other, solvents, although, exotic, on, earth, one, of, the, most, common, ions, in, the, universe, is, the, h, 3, ion, known, as, protonated, molecular, hydrogen, or, the, trihydrogen, cation, hydrogen, has, three, naturally, occurring, isotopes, denoted, 1, h, 2, h, and, 3, h, other, highly, unstable, nuclei, 4, h, to, 7, h, have, been, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, but, not, observed, in, nature, unique, among, the, elements, distinct, names, are, assigned, to, its, isotopes, in, common, use, during, the, early, study, of, radioactivity, heavy, radioisotopes, were, given, their, own, names, but, these, are, mostly, no, longer, used, the, symbols, d, and, t, instead, of, 2, h, and, 3, h, are, sometimes, used, for, deuterium, and, tritium, but, the, symbol, p, was, already, used, for, phosphorus, and, thus, was, not, available, for, protium, in, its, nomenclatural, guidelines, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, allows, any, of, d, t, 2, h, and, 3, h, to, be, used, though, 2, h, and, 3, h, are, preferred, the, exotic, atom, muonium, symbol, mu, composed, of, an, anti, muon, and, an, electron, can, also, be, considered, a, light, radioisotope, of, hydrogen, because, muons, decay, with, lifetime, 2, 2, s, muonium, is, too, unstable, for, observable, chemistry, nevertheless, muonium, compounds, are, important, test, cases, for, quantum, simulation, due, to, the, mass, difference, between, the, antimuon, and, the, proton, and, iupac, nomenclature, incorporates, such, hypothetical, compounds, as, muonium, chloride, mucl, and, sodium, muonide, namu, analogous, to, hydrogen, chloride, and, sodium, hydride, respectively, table, of, thermal, and, physical, properties, of, hydrogen, h, 2, at, atmospheric, pressure, in, 1671, irish, scientist, robert, boyle, discovered, and, described, the, reaction, between, iron, filings, and, dilute, acids, which, results, in, the, production, of, hydrogen, gas, having, provided, a, saline, spirit, which, by, an, uncommon, way, of, preparation, was, made, exceeding, sharp, and, piercing, we, put, into, a, vial, capable, of, containing, three, or, four, ounces, of, water, a, convenient, quantity, of, filings, of, steel, which, were, not, such, as, are, commonly, sold, in, shops, to, chymists, and, apothecaries, those, being, usually, not, free, enough, from, rust, but, such, as, i, had, a, while, before, caus, d, to, be, purposely, fil, d, off, from, a, piece, of, good, steel, this, metalline, powder, being, moistn, d, in, the, viol, with, a, little, of, the, menstruum, was, afterwards, drench, d, with, more, whereupon, the, mixture, grew, very, hot, and, belch, d, up, copious, and, stinking, fumes, which, whether, they, consisted, altogether, of, the, volatile, sulfur, of, the, mars, or, of, metalline, steams, participating, of, a, sulfureous, nature, and, join, d, with, the, saline, exhalations, of, the, menstruum, is, not, necessary, to, be, here, discuss, d, but, whencesoever, this, stinking, smoak, proceeded, so, inflammable, it, was, that, upon, the, approach, of, a, lighted, candle, to, it, it, would, readily, enough, take, fire, and, burn, with, a, blewish, and, somewhat, greenish, flame, at, the, mouth, of, the, viol, for, a, good, while, together, and, that, though, with, little, light, yet, with, more, strength, than, one, would, easily, suspect, the, word, sulfureous, may, be, somewhat, confusing, especially, since, boyle, did, a, similar, experiment, with, iron, and, sulfuric, acid, however, in, all, likelihood, sulfureous, should, here, be, understood, to, mean, combustible, in, 1766, henry, cavendish, was, the, first, to, recognize, hydrogen, gas, as, a, discrete, substance, by, naming, the, gas, from, a, metal, acid, reaction, inflammable, air, he, speculated, that, inflammable, air, was, in, fact, identical, to, the, hypothetical, substance, phlogiston, and, further, finding, in, 1781, that, the, gas, produces, water, when, burned, he, is, usually, given, credit, for, the, discovery, of, hydrogen, as, an, element, in, 1783, antoine, lavoisier, identified, the, element, that, came, to, be, known, as, hydrogen, when, he, and, laplace, reproduced, cavendish, s, finding, that, water, is, produced, when, hydrogen, is, burned, lavoisier, produced, hydrogen, for, his, experiments, on, mass, conservation, by, reacting, a, flux, of, steam, with, metallic, iron, through, an, incandescent, iron, tube, heated, in, a, fire, anaerobic, oxidation, of, iron, by, the, protons, of, water, at, high, temperature, can, be, schematically, represented, by, the, set, of, following, reactions, many, metals, such, as, zirconium, undergo, a, similar, reaction, with, water, leading, to, the, production, of, hydrogen, fran, ois, isaac, de, rivaz, built, the, first, de, rivaz, engine, an, internal, combustion, engine, powered, by, a, mixture, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, in, 1806, edward, daniel, clarke, invented, the, hydrogen, gas, blowpipe, in, 1819, the, d, bereiner, s, lamp, and, limelight, were, invented, in, 1823, hydrogen, was, liquefied, for, the, first, time, by, james, dewar, in, 1898, by, using, regenerative, cooling, and, his, invention, the, vacuum, flask, he, produced, solid, hydrogen, the, next, year, the, first, hydrogen, filled, balloon, was, invented, by, jacques, charles, in, 1783, hydrogen, provided, the, lift, for, the, first, reliable, form, of, air, travel, following, the, 1852, invention, of, the, first, hydrogen, lifted, airship, by, henri, giffard, german, count, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, promoted, the, idea, of, rigid, airships, lifted, by, hydrogen, that, later, were, called, zeppelins, the, first, of, which, had, its, maiden, flight, in, 1900, regularly, scheduled, flights, started, in, 1910, and, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, august, 1914, they, had, carried, 35, 000, passengers, without, a, serious, incident, hydrogen, lifted, airships, were, used, as, observation, platforms, and, bombers, during, the, war, the, first, non, stop, transatlantic, crossing, was, made, by, the, british, airship, r34, in, 1919, regular, passenger, service, resumed, in, the, 1920s, and, the, discovery, of, helium, reserves, in, the, united, states, promised, increased, safety, but, the, u, s, government, refused, to, sell, the, gas, for, this, purpose, therefore, h, 2, was, used, in, the, hindenburg, airship, which, was, destroyed, in, a, midair, fire, over, new, jersey, on, 6, may, 1937, the, incident, was, broadcast, live, on, radio, and, filmed, ignition, of, leaking, hydrogen, is, widely, assumed, to, be, the, cause, but, later, investigations, pointed, to, the, ignition, of, the, aluminized, fabric, coating, by, static, electricity, but, the, damage, to, hydrogen, s, reputation, as, a, lifting, gas, was, already, done, and, commercial, hydrogen, airship, travel, ceased, hydrogen, is, still, used, in, preference, to, non, flammable, but, more, expensive, helium, as, a, lifting, gas, for, weather, balloons, deuterium, was, discovered, in, december, 1931, by, harold, urey, and, tritium, was, prepared, in, 1934, by, ernest, rutherford, mark, oliphant, and, paul, harteck, heavy, water, which, consists, of, deuterium, in, the, place, of, regular, hydrogen, was, discovered, by, urey, s, group, in, 1932, the, first, hydrogen, cooled, turbogenerator, went, into, service, using, gaseous, hydrogen, as, a, coolant, in, the, rotor, and, the, stator, in, 1937, at, dayton, ohio, owned, by, the, dayton, power, light, co, this, was, justified, by, the, high, thermal, conductivity, and, very, low, viscosity, of, hydrogen, gas, thus, lower, drag, than, air, this, is, the, most, common, coolant, used, for, generators, 60, mw, and, larger, smaller, generators, are, usually, air, cooled, the, nickel, hydrogen, battery, was, used, for, the, first, time, in, 1977, aboard, the, u, s, navy, s, navigation, technology, satellite, 2, nts, 2, the, international, space, station, mars, odyssey, and, the, mars, global, surveyor, are, equipped, with, nickel, hydrogen, batteries, in, the, dark, part, of, its, orbit, the, hubble, space, telescope, is, also, powered, by, nickel, hydrogen, batteries, which, were, finally, replaced, in, may, 2009, more, than, 19, years, after, launch, and, 13, years, beyond, their, design, life, because, of, its, simple, atomic, structure, consisting, only, of, a, proton, and, an, electron, the, hydrogen, atom, together, with, the, spectrum, of, light, produced, from, it, or, absorbed, by, it, has, been, central, to, the, development, of, the, theory, of, atomic, structure, furthermore, study, of, the, corresponding, simplicity, of, the, hydrogen, molecule, and, the, corresponding, cation, h, 2, brought, understanding, of, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, which, followed, shortly, after, the, quantum, mechanical, treatment, of, the, hydrogen, atom, had, been, developed, in, the, mid, 1920s, one, of, the, first, quantum, effects, to, be, explicitly, noticed, but, not, understood, at, the, time, was, a, maxwell, observation, involving, hydrogen, half, a, century, before, full, quantum, mechanical, theory, arrived, maxwell, observed, that, the, specific, heat, capacity, of, h, 2, unaccountably, departs, from, that, of, a, diatomic, gas, below, room, temperature, and, begins, to, increasingly, resemble, that, of, a, monatomic, gas, at, cryogenic, temperatures, according, to, quantum, theory, this, behavior, arises, from, the, spacing, of, the, quantized, rotational, energy, levels, which, are, particularly, wide, spaced, in, h, 2, because, of, its, low, mass, these, widely, spaced, levels, inhibit, equal, partition, of, heat, energy, into, rotational, motion, in, hydrogen, at, low, temperatures, diatomic, gases, composed, of, heavier, atoms, do, not, have, such, widely, spaced, levels, and, do, not, exhibit, the, same, effect, antihydrogen, h, is, the, antimatter, counterpart, to, hydrogen, it, consists, of, an, antiproton, with, a, positron, antihydrogen, is, the, only, type, of, antimatter, atom, to, have, been, produced, as, of, 2015, hydrogen, as, atomic, h, is, the, most, abundant, chemical, element, in, the, universe, making, up, 75, of, normal, matter, by, mass, and, 90, by, number, of, atoms, most, of, the, mass, of, the, universe, however, is, not, in, the, form, of, chemical, element, type, matter, but, rather, is, postulated, to, occur, as, yet, undetected, forms, of, mass, such, as, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, hydrogen, is, found, in, great, abundance, in, stars, and, gas, giant, planets, molecular, clouds, of, h, 2, are, associated, with, star, formation, hydrogen, plays, a, vital, role, in, powering, stars, through, the, proton, proton, reaction, in, case, of, stars, with, very, low, to, approximately, 1, mass, of, the, sun, and, the, cno, cycle, of, nuclear, fusion, in, case, of, stars, more, massive, than, the, sun, throughout, the, universe, hydrogen, is, mostly, found, in, the, atomic, and, plasma, states, with, properties, quite, distinct, from, those, of, molecular, hydrogen, as, a, plasma, hydrogen, s, electron, and, proton, are, not, bound, together, resulting, in, very, high, electrical, conductivity, and, high, emissivity, producing, the, light, from, the, sun, and, other, stars, the, charged, particles, are, highly, influenced, by, magnetic, and, electric, fields, for, example, in, the, solar, wind, they, interact, with, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, giving, rise, to, birkeland, currents, and, the, aurora, hydrogen, is, found, in, the, neutral, atomic, state, in, the, interstellar, medium, because, the, atoms, seldom, collide, and, combine, they, are, the, source, of, the, 21, cm, hydrogen, line, at, 1420, mhz, that, is, detected, in, order, to, probe, primordial, hydrogen, the, large, amount, of, neutral, hydrogen, found, in, the, damped, lyman, alpha, systems, is, thought, to, dominate, the, cosmological, baryonic, density, of, the, universe, up, to, a, redshift, of, z, 4, under, ordinary, conditions, on, earth, elemental, hydrogen, exists, as, the, diatomic, gas, h, 2, hydrogen, gas, is, very, rare, in, earth, s, atmosphere, around, 0, 53, ppm, on, a, molar, basis, because, of, its, light, weight, which, enables, it, to, escape, the, atmosphere, more, rapidly, than, heavier, gases, however, hydrogen, is, the, third, most, abundant, element, on, the, earth, s, surface, mostly, in, the, form, of, chemical, compounds, such, as, hydrocarbons, and, water, a, molecular, form, called, protonated, molecular, hydrogen, h, 3, is, found, in, the, interstellar, medium, where, it, is, generated, by, ionization, of, molecular, hydrogen, from, cosmic, rays, this, ion, has, also, been, observed, in, the, upper, atmosphere, of, jupiter, the, ion, is, relatively, stable, in, outer, space, due, to, the, low, temperature, and, density, h, 3, is, one, of, the, most, abundant, ions, in, the, universe, and, it, plays, a, notable, role, in, the, chemistry, of, the, interstellar, medium, neutral, triatomic, hydrogen, h, 3, can, exist, only, in, an, excited, form, and, is, unstable, by, contrast, the, positive, hydrogen, molecular, ion, h, 2, is, a, rare, molecule, in, the, universe, many, methods, exist, for, producing, h, 2, but, three, dominate, commercially, steam, reforming, often, coupled, to, water, gas, shift, partial, oxidation, of, hydrocarbons, and, water, electrolysis, hydrogen, is, mainly, produced, by, steam, methane, reforming, smr, the, reaction, of, water, and, methane, thus, at, high, temperature, 1000, 1400, k, 700, 1100, c, or, 1300, 2000, f, steam, water, vapor, reacts, with, methane, to, yield, carbon, monoxide, and, h, 2, steam, reforming, is, also, used, for, the, industrial, preparation, of, ammonia, this, reaction, is, favored, at, low, pressures, nonetheless, conducted, at, high, pressures, 2, 0, mpa, 20, atm, or, 600, inhg, because, high, pressure, h, 2, is, the, most, marketable, product, and, pressure, swing, adsorption, psa, purification, systems, work, better, at, higher, pressures, the, product, mixture, is, known, as, synthesis, gas, because, it, is, often, used, directly, for, the, production, of, methanol, and, many, other, compounds, hydrocarbons, other, than, methane, can, be, used, to, produce, synthesis, gas, with, varying, product, ratios, one, of, the, many, complications, to, this, highly, optimized, technology, is, the, formation, of, coke, or, carbon, therefore, steam, reforming, typically, employs, an, excess, of, h, 2, o, additional, hydrogen, can, be, recovered, from, the, steam, by, using, carbon, monoxide, through, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, wgs, this, process, requires, an, iron, oxide, catalyst, hydrogen, is, sometimes, produced, and, consumed, in, the, same, industrial, process, without, being, separated, in, the, haber, process, for, ammonia, production, hydrogen, is, generated, from, natural, gas, other, methods, for, co, and, h, 2, production, include, partial, oxidation, of, hydrocarbons, although, less, important, commercially, coal, can, serve, as, a, prelude, to, the, shift, reaction, above, olefin, production, units, may, produce, substantial, quantities, of, byproduct, hydrogen, particularly, from, cracking, light, feedstocks, like, ethane, or, propane, electrolysis, of, water, is, a, conceptually, simple, method, of, producing, hydrogen, commercial, electrolyzers, use, nickel, based, catalysts, in, strongly, alkaline, solution, platinum, is, a, better, catalyst, but, is, expensive, electrolysis, of, brine, to, yield, chlorine, also, produces, hydrogen, as, a, co, product, hydrogen, can, be, produced, by, pyrolysis, of, natural, gas, methane, this, route, has, a, lower, carbon, footprint, than, commercial, hydrogen, production, processes, developing, a, commercial, methane, pyrolysis, process, could, expedite, the, expanded, use, of, hydrogen, in, industrial, and, transportation, applications, methane, pyrolysis, is, accomplished, by, passing, methane, through, a, molten, metal, catalyst, containing, dissolved, nickel, methane, is, converted, to, hydrogen, gas, and, solid, carbon, the, carbon, may, be, sold, as, a, manufacturing, feedstock, or, fuel, or, landfilled, further, research, continues, in, several, laboratories, including, at, karlsruhe, liquid, metal, laboratory, and, at, university, of, california, santa, barbara, basf, built, a, methane, pyrolysis, pilot, plant, more, than, 200, thermochemical, cycles, can, be, used, for, water, splitting, many, of, these, cycles, such, as, the, iron, oxide, cycle, cerium, iv, oxide, cerium, iii, oxide, cycle, zinc, zinc, oxide, cycle, sulfur, iodine, cycle, copper, chlorine, cycle, and, hybrid, sulfur, cycle, have, been, evaluated, for, their, commercial, potential, to, produce, hydrogen, and, oxygen, from, water, and, heat, without, using, electricity, a, number, of, labs, including, in, france, germany, greece, japan, and, the, united, states, are, developing, thermochemical, methods, to, produce, hydrogen, from, solar, energy, and, water, h, 2, is, produced, in, labs, often, as, a, by, product, of, other, reactions, many, metals, react, with, water, to, produce, h, 2, but, the, rate, of, hydrogen, evolution, depends, on, the, metal, the, ph, and, the, presence, of, alloying, agents, most, often, hydrogen, evolution, is, induced, by, acids, the, alkali, and, alkaline, earth, metals, aluminium, zinc, manganese, and, iron, react, readily, with, aqueous, acids, this, reaction, is, the, basis, of, the, kipp, s, apparatus, which, once, was, used, as, a, laboratory, gas, source, in, the, absence, of, acid, the, evolution, of, h, 2, is, slower, because, iron, is, widely, used, structural, material, its, anaerobic, corrosion, is, of, technological, significance, many, metals, such, as, aluminium, are, slow, to, react, with, water, because, they, form, passivated, oxide, coatings, of, oxides, an, alloy, of, aluminium, and, gallium, however, does, react, with, water, at, high, ph, aluminium, can, produce, h, 2, some, metal, containing, compounds, react, with, acids, to, evolve, h, 2, under, anaerobic, conditions, ferrous, hydroxide, fe, oh, 2, can, be, oxidized, by, the, protons, of, water, to, form, magnetite, and, h, 2, this, process, is, described, by, the, schikorr, reaction, this, process, occurs, during, the, anaerobic, corrosion, of, iron, and, steel, in, oxygen, free, groundwater, and, in, reducing, soils, below, the, water, table, h, 2, is, produced, by, hydrogenase, enzymes, in, some, fermentation, there, is, a, well, in, mali, and, deposits, in, several, other, countries, such, as, france, large, quantities, of, h, 2, are, used, in, the, upgrading, of, fossil, fuels, key, consumers, of, h, 2, include, hydrodesulfurization, and, hydrocracking, many, of, these, reactions, can, be, classified, as, hydrogenolysis, i, e, the, cleavage, of, bonds, by, hydrogen, illustrative, is, the, separation, of, sulfur, from, liquid, fossil, fuels, hydrogenation, the, addition, of, h, 2, to, various, substrates, is, done, on, a, large, scale, hydrogenation, of, n, 2, to, produce, ammonia, by, the, haber, process, consumes, a, few, percent, of, the, energy, budget, in, the, entire, industry, the, resulting, ammonia, is, used, to, supply, most, of, the, protein, consumed, by, humans, hydrogenation, is, used, to, convert, unsaturated, fats, and, oils, to, saturated, trans, fats, and, oils, the, major, application, is, the, production, of, margarine, methanol, is, produced, by, hydrogenation, of, carbon, dioxide, it, is, similarly, the, source, of, hydrogen, in, the, manufacture, of, hydrochloric, acid, h, 2, is, also, used, as, a, reducing, agent, for, the, conversion, of, some, ores, to, the, metals, hydrogen, is, commonly, used, in, power, stations, as, a, coolant, in, generators, due, to, a, number, of, favorable, properties, that, are, a, direct, result, of, its, light, diatomic, molecules, these, include, low, density, low, viscosity, and, the, highest, specific, heat, and, thermal, conductivity, of, all, gases, elemental, hydrogen, is, widely, discussed, in, the, context, of, energy, as, an, energy, carrier, with, potential, to, help, to, decarbonize, economies, and, mitigate, greenhouse, gas, emissions, this, therefore, requires, hydrogen, to, be, produced, cleanly, in, quantities, to, be, supplied, in, sectors, and, applications, where, cheaper, and, more, energy, efficient, mitigation, alternatives, are, limited, these, include, heavy, industry, and, long, distance, transport, hydrogen, is, a, carrier, of, energy, rather, than, an, energy, resource, because, there, is, no, naturally, occurring, source, of, hydrogen, in, useful, quantities, hydrogen, can, be, deployed, as, an, energy, source, in, fuel, cells, to, produce, electricity, or, via, combustion, to, generate, heat, when, hydrogen, is, consumed, in, fuel, cells, the, only, emission, at, the, point, of, use, is, water, vapor, combustion, of, hydrogen, can, lead, to, the, thermal, formation, of, harmful, nitrogen, oxides, the, overall, lifecycle, emissions, of, hydrogen, depend, on, how, it, is, produced, nearly, all, the, world, s, current, supply, of, hydrogen, is, created, from, fossil, fuels, the, main, method, is, steam, methane, reforming, in, which, hydrogen, is, produced, from, a, chemical, reaction, between, steam, and, methane, the, main, component, of, natural, gas, producing, one, tonne, of, hydrogen, through, this, process, emits, 6, 6, 9, 3, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, while, carbon, capture, and, storage, ccs, could, remove, a, large, fraction, of, these, emissions, the, overall, carbon, footprint, of, hydrogen, from, natural, gas, is, difficult, to, assess, as, of, 2021, in, part, because, of, emissions, including, vented, and, fugitive, methane, created, in, the, production, of, the, natural, gas, itself, electricity, can, be, used, to, split, water, molecules, producing, sustainable, hydrogen, provided, the, electricity, was, generated, sustainably, however, this, electrolysis, process, is, currently, more, expensive, than, creating, hydrogen, from, methane, without, ccs, and, the, efficiency, of, energy, conversion, is, inherently, low, hydrogen, can, be, produced, when, there, is, a, surplus, of, variable, renewable, electricity, then, stored, and, used, to, generate, heat, or, to, re, generate, electricity, hydrogen, created, through, electrolysis, using, renewable, energy, is, commonly, referred, to, as, green, hydrogen, it, can, be, further, transformed, into, synthetic, fuels, such, as, ammonia, and, methanol, innovation, in, hydrogen, electrolyzers, could, make, large, scale, production, of, hydrogen, from, electricity, more, cost, competitive, there, is, potential, for, hydrogen, produced, this, way, to, play, a, significant, role, in, decarbonizing, energy, systems, where, there, are, challenges, and, limitations, to, replacing, fossil, fuels, with, direct, use, of, electricity, hydrogen, fuel, can, produce, the, intense, heat, required, for, industrial, production, of, steel, cement, glass, and, chemicals, thus, contributing, to, the, decarbonisation, of, industry, alongside, other, technologies, such, as, electric, arc, furnaces, for, steelmaking, however, it, is, likely, to, play, a, larger, role, in, providing, industrial, feedstock, for, cleaner, production, of, ammonia, and, organic, chemicals, for, example, in, steelmaking, hydrogen, could, function, as, a, clean, energy, carrier, and, also, as, a, low, carbon, catalyst, replacing, coal, derived, coke, hydrogen, used, to, decarbonise, transportation, is, likely, to, find, its, largest, applications, in, shipping, aviation, and, to, a, lesser, extent, heavy, goods, vehicles, through, the, use, of, hydrogen, derived, synthetic, fuels, such, as, ammonia, and, methanol, and, fuel, cell, technology, for, light, duty, vehicles, including, cars, hydrogen, is, far, behind, other, alternative, fuel, vehicles, especially, compared, with, the, rate, of, adoption, of, battery, electric, vehicles, and, may, not, play, a, significant, role, in, future, disadvantages, of, hydrogen, as, an, energy, carrier, include, high, costs, of, storage, and, distribution, due, to, hydrogen, s, explosivity, its, large, volume, compared, to, other, fuels, and, its, tendency, to, make, pipes, brittle, hydrogen, is, employed, to, saturate, broken, dangling, bonds, of, amorphous, silicon, and, amorphous, carbon, that, helps, stabilizing, material, properties, it, is, also, a, potential, electron, donor, in, various, oxide, materials, including, zno, sno, 2, cdo, mgo, zro, 2, hfo, 2, la, 2, o, 3, y, 2, o, 3, tio, 2, srtio, 3, laalo, 3, sio, 2, al, 2, o, 3, zrsio, 4, hfsio, 4, and, srzro, 3, h, 2, is, a, product, of, some, types, of, anaerobic, metabolism, and, is, produced, by, several, microorganisms, usually, via, reactions, catalyzed, by, iron, or, nickel, containing, enzymes, called, hydrogenases, these, enzymes, catalyze, the, reversible, redox, reaction, between, h, 2, and, its, component, two, protons, and, two, electrons, creation, of, hydrogen, gas, occurs, in, the, transfer, of, reducing, equivalents, produced, during, pyruvate, fermentation, to, water, the, natural, cycle, of, hydrogen, production, and, consumption, by, organisms, is, called, the, hydrogen, cycle, bacteria, such, as, mycobacterium, smegmatis, can, use, the, small, amount, of, hydrogen, in, the, atmosphere, as, a, source, of, energy, when, other, sources, are, lacking, using, a, hydrogenase, with, small, channels, that, exclude, oxygen, and, so, permits, the, reaction, to, occur, even, though, the, hydrogen, concentration, is, very, low, and, the, oxygen, concentration, is, as, in, normal, air, hydrogen, is, the, most, abundant, element, in, the, human, body, by, numbers, of, atoms, but, the, third, most, abundant, by, mass, h, 2, occurs, in, human, breath, due, to, the, metabolic, activity, of, hydrogenase, containing, microorganisms, in, the, large, intestine, and, is, a, natural, component, of, flatus, the, concentration, in, the, breath, of, fasting, people, at, rest, is, typically, less, than, 5, parts, per, million, ppm, but, can, be, 50, ppm, when, people, with, intestinal, disorders, consume, molecules, they, cannot, absorb, during, diagnostic, hydrogen, breath, tests, water, splitting, in, which, water, is, decomposed, into, its, component, protons, electrons, and, oxygen, occurs, in, the, light, reactions, in, all, photosynthetic, organisms, some, such, organisms, including, the, alga, chlamydomonas, reinhardtii, and, cyanobacteria, have, evolved, a, second, step, in, the, dark, reactions, in, which, protons, and, electrons, are, reduced, to, form, h, 2, gas, by, specialized, hydrogenases, in, the, chloroplast, efforts, have, been, undertaken, to, genetically, modify, cyanobacterial, hydrogenases, to, efficiently, synthesize, h, 2, gas, even, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, efforts, have, also, been, undertaken, with, genetically, modified, alga, in, a, bioreactor, hydrogen, poses, a, number, of, hazards, to, human, safety, from, potential, detonations, and, fires, when, mixed, with, air, to, being, an, asphyxiant, in, its, pure, oxygen, free, form, also, liquid, hydrogen, is, a, cryogen, and, presents, dangers, such, as, frostbite, associated, with, very, cold, liquids, hydrogen, dissolves, in, many, metals, and, in, addition, to, leaking, out, may, have, adverse, effects, on, them, such, as, hydrogen, embrittlement, leading, to, cracks, and, explosions, hydrogen, gas, leaking, into, external, air, may, spontaneously, ignite, moreover, hydrogen, fire, while, being, extremely, hot, is, almost, invisible, and, thus, can, lead, to, accidental, burns, even, interpreting, the, hydrogen, data, including, safety, data, is, confounded, by, a, number, of, phenomena, many, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, hydrogen, depend, on, the, parahydrogen, orthohydrogen, ratio, it, often, takes, days, or, weeks, at, a, given, temperature, to, reach, the, equilibrium, ratio, for, which, the, data, is, usually, given, hydrogen, detonation, parameters, such, as, critical, detonation, pressure, and, temperature, strongly, depend, on, the, container, geometry
