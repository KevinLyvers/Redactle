a, metamaterial, from, the, greek, word, meta, meaning, beyond, or, after, and, the, latin, word, materia, meaning, matter, or, material, is, a, type, of, material, engineered, to, have, a, property, typically, rarely, observed, in, naturally, occurring, materials, that, is, derived, not, from, the, properties, of, the, base, materials, but, from, their, newly, designed, structures, metamaterials, are, usually, fashioned, from, multiple, materials, such, as, metals, and, plastics, and, are, usually, arranged, in, repeating, patterns, at, scales, that, are, smaller, than, the, wavelengths, of, the, phenomena, they, influence, their, precise, shape, geometry, size, orientation, and, arrangement, give, them, their, smart, properties, of, manipulating, electromagnetic, acoustic, or, even, seismic, waves, by, blocking, absorbing, enhancing, or, bending, waves, to, achieve, benefits, that, go, beyond, what, is, possible, with, conventional, materials, appropriately, designed, metamaterials, can, affect, waves, of, electromagnetic, radiation, or, sound, in, a, manner, not, observed, in, bulk, materials, those, that, exhibit, a, negative, index, of, refraction, for, particular, wavelengths, have, been, the, focus, of, a, large, amount, of, research, these, materials, are, known, as, negative, index, metamaterials, potential, applications, of, metamaterials, are, diverse, and, include, optical, filters, medical, devices, remote, aerospace, applications, sensor, detection, and, infrastructure, monitoring, smart, solar, power, management, lasers, crowd, control, radomes, high, frequency, battlefield, communication, and, lenses, for, high, gain, antennas, improving, ultrasonic, sensors, and, even, shielding, structures, from, earthquakes, metamaterials, offer, the, potential, to, create, super, lenses, such, a, lens, can, allow, imaging, below, the, diffraction, limit, that, is, the, minimum, resolution, d, 2na, that, can, be, achieved, by, conventional, lenses, having, a, numerical, aperture, na, and, with, illumination, wavelength, sub, wavelength, optical, metamaterials, when, integrated, with, optical, recording, media, can, be, used, to, achieve, optical, data, density, higher, than, limited, by, diffraction, a, form, of, invisibility, was, demonstrated, using, gradient, index, materials, acoustic, and, seismic, metamaterials, are, also, research, areas, metamaterial, research, is, interdisciplinary, and, involves, such, fields, as, electrical, engineering, electromagnetics, classical, optics, solid, state, physics, microwave, and, antenna, engineering, optoelectronics, material, sciences, nanoscience, and, semiconductor, engineering, explorations, of, artificial, materials, for, manipulating, electromagnetic, waves, began, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, some, of, the, earliest, structures, that, may, be, considered, metamaterials, were, studied, by, jagadish, chandra, bose, who, in, 1898, researched, substances, with, chiral, properties, karl, ferdinand, lindman, studied, wave, interaction, with, metallic, helices, as, artificial, chiral, media, in, the, early, twentieth, century, in, the, late, 1940s, winston, e, kock, from, at, t, bell, laboratories, developed, materials, that, had, similar, characteristics, to, metamaterials, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, artificial, dielectrics, were, studied, for, lightweight, microwave, antennas, microwave, radar, absorbers, were, researched, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, as, applications, for, artificial, chiral, media, negative, index, materials, were, first, described, theoretically, by, victor, veselago, in, 1967, he, proved, that, such, materials, could, transmit, light, he, showed, that, the, phase, velocity, could, be, made, anti, parallel, to, the, direction, of, poynting, vector, this, is, contrary, to, wave, propagation, in, naturally, occurring, materials, in, 1995, john, m, guerra, fabricated, a, sub, wavelength, transparent, grating, later, called, a, photonic, metamaterial, having, 50, nm, lines, and, spaces, and, then, coupled, it, with, a, standard, oil, immersion, microscope, objective, the, combination, later, called, a, super, lens, to, resolve, a, grating, in, a, silicon, wafer, also, having, 50, nm, lines, and, spaces, this, super, resolved, image, was, achieved, with, illumination, having, a, wavelength, of, 650, nm, in, air, in, 2000, john, pendry, was, the, first, to, identify, a, practical, way, to, make, a, left, handed, metamaterial, a, material, in, which, the, right, hand, rule, is, not, followed, such, a, material, allows, an, electromagnetic, wave, to, convey, energy, have, a, group, velocity, against, its, phase, velocity, pendry, s, idea, was, that, metallic, wires, aligned, along, the, direction, of, a, wave, could, provide, negative, permittivity, dielectric, function, 0, natural, materials, such, as, ferroelectrics, display, negative, permittivity, the, challenge, was, achieving, negative, permeability, 0, in, 1999, pendry, demonstrated, that, a, split, ring, c, shape, with, its, axis, placed, along, the, direction, of, wave, propagation, could, do, so, in, the, same, paper, he, showed, that, a, periodic, array, of, wires, and, rings, could, give, rise, to, a, negative, refractive, index, pendry, also, proposed, a, related, negative, permeability, design, the, swiss, roll, in, 2000, david, r, smith, et, al, reported, the, experimental, demonstration, of, functioning, electromagnetic, metamaterials, by, horizontally, stacking, periodically, split, ring, resonators, and, thin, wire, structures, a, method, was, provided, in, 2002, to, realize, negative, index, metamaterials, using, artificial, lumped, element, loaded, transmission, lines, in, microstrip, technology, in, 2003, complex, both, real, and, imaginary, parts, of, negative, refractive, index, and, imaging, by, flat, lens, using, left, handed, metamaterials, were, demonstrated, by, 2007, experiments, that, involved, negative, refractive, index, had, been, conducted, by, many, groups, at, microwave, frequencies, the, first, imperfect, invisibility, cloak, was, realized, in, 2006, from, the, standpoint, of, governing, equations, contemporary, researchers, can, classify, the, realm, of, metamaterials, into, three, primary, branches, electromagnetic, optical, wave, metamaterials, other, wave, metamaterials, and, diffusion, metamaterials, these, branches, are, characterized, by, their, respective, governing, equations, which, include, maxwell, s, equations, a, wave, equation, describing, transverse, waves, other, wave, equations, for, longitudinal, and, transverse, waves, and, diffusion, equations, pertaining, to, diffusion, processes, crafted, to, govern, a, range, of, diffusion, activities, diffusion, metamaterials, prioritize, diffusion, length, as, their, central, metric, this, crucial, parameter, experiences, temporal, fluctuations, while, remaining, immune, to, frequency, variations, in, contrast, wave, metamaterials, designed, to, adjust, various, wave, propagation, paths, consider, the, wavelength, of, incoming, waves, as, their, essential, metric, this, wavelength, remains, constant, over, time, though, it, adjusts, with, frequency, alterations, fundamentally, the, key, metrics, for, diffusion, and, wave, metamaterials, present, a, stark, divergence, underscoring, a, distinct, complementary, relationship, between, them, for, comprehensive, information, please, refer, to, section, i, b, evolution, of, metamaterial, physics, in, ref, an, electromagnetic, metamaterial, affects, electromagnetic, waves, that, impinge, on, or, interact, with, its, structural, features, which, are, smaller, than, the, wavelength, to, behave, as, a, homogeneous, material, accurately, described, by, an, effective, refractive, index, its, features, must, be, much, smaller, than, the, wavelength, the, unusual, properties, of, metamaterials, arise, from, the, resonant, response, of, each, constituent, element, rather, than, their, spatial, arrangement, into, a, lattice, it, allows, considering, the, local, effective, material, parameters, permittivity, and, permeability, the, resonance, effect, related, to, the, mutual, arrangement, of, elements, is, responsible, for, bragg, scattering, which, underlies, the, physics, of, photonic, crystals, another, class, of, electromagnetic, materials, unlike, the, local, resonances, bragg, scattering, and, corresponding, bragg, stop, band, have, a, low, frequency, limit, determined, by, the, lattice, spacing, the, subwavelength, approximation, ensures, that, the, bragg, stop, bands, with, the, strong, spatial, dispersion, effects, are, at, higher, frequencies, and, can, be, neglected, the, criterion, for, shifting, the, local, resonance, below, the, lower, bragg, stop, band, make, it, possible, to, build, a, photonic, phase, transition, diagram, in, a, parameter, space, for, example, size, and, permittivity, of, the, constituent, element, such, diagram, displays, the, domain, of, structure, parameters, allowing, the, metamaterial, properties, observation, in, the, electromagnetic, material, for, microwave, radiation, the, features, are, on, the, order, of, millimeters, microwave, frequency, metamaterials, are, usually, constructed, as, arrays, of, electrically, conductive, elements, such, as, loops, of, wire, that, have, suitable, inductive, and, capacitive, characteristics, many, microwave, metamaterials, use, split, ring, resonators, photonic, metamaterials, are, structured, on, the, nanometer, scale, and, manipulate, light, at, optical, frequencies, photonic, crystals, and, frequency, selective, surfaces, such, as, diffraction, gratings, dielectric, mirrors, and, optical, coatings, exhibit, similarities, to, subwavelength, structured, metamaterials, however, these, are, usually, considered, distinct, from, metamaterials, as, their, function, arises, from, diffraction, or, interference, and, thus, cannot, be, approximated, as, a, homogeneous, material, however, material, structures, such, as, photonic, crystals, are, effective, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, the, middle, of, the, visible, spectrum, has, a, wavelength, of, approximately, 560, nm, for, sunlight, photonic, crystal, structures, are, generally, half, this, size, or, smaller, that, is, 280, nm, plasmonic, metamaterials, utilize, surface, plasmons, which, are, packets, of, electrical, charge, that, collectively, oscillate, at, the, surfaces, of, metals, at, optical, frequencies, frequency, selective, surfaces, fss, can, exhibit, subwavelength, characteristics, and, are, known, variously, as, artificial, magnetic, conductors, amc, or, high, impedance, surfaces, his, fss, display, inductive, and, capacitive, characteristics, that, are, directly, related, to, their, subwavelength, structure, electromagnetic, metamaterials, can, be, divided, into, different, classes, as, follows, negative, index, metamaterials, nim, are, characterized, by, a, negative, index, of, refraction, other, terms, for, nims, include, left, handed, media, media, with, a, negative, refractive, index, and, backward, wave, media, nims, where, the, negative, index, of, refraction, arises, from, simultaneously, negative, permittivity, and, negative, permeability, are, also, known, as, double, negative, metamaterials, or, double, negative, materials, dng, assuming, a, material, well, approximated, by, a, real, permittivity, and, permeability, the, relationship, between, permittivity, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, permeability, r, displaystyle, mu, r, and, refractive, index, n, is, given, by, n, r, r, textstyle, n, pm, sqrt, varepsilon, mathrm, r, mu, mathrm, r, all, known, non, metamaterial, transparent, materials, glass, water, possess, positive, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, by, convention, the, positive, square, root, is, used, for, n, however, some, engineered, metamaterials, have, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, 0, displaystyle, mu, r, 0, because, the, product, r, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, mu, r, is, positive, n, is, real, under, such, circumstances, it, is, necessary, to, take, the, negative, square, root, for, n, when, both, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, are, positive, negative, waves, travel, in, the, forward, backward, direction, electromagnetic, waves, cannot, propagate, in, materials, with, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, of, opposite, sign, as, the, refractive, index, becomes, imaginary, such, materials, are, opaque, for, electromagnetic, radiation, and, examples, include, plasmonic, materials, such, as, metals, gold, silver, the, foregoing, considerations, are, simplistic, for, actual, materials, which, must, have, complex, valued, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, the, real, parts, of, both, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, do, not, have, to, be, negative, for, a, passive, material, to, display, negative, refraction, indeed, a, negative, refractive, index, for, circularly, polarized, waves, can, also, arise, from, chirality, metamaterials, with, negative, n, have, numerous, interesting, properties, negative, index, of, refraction, derives, mathematically, from, the, vector, triplet, e, h, and, k, for, plane, waves, propagating, in, electromagnetic, metamaterials, the, electric, field, magnetic, field, and, wave, vector, follow, a, left, hand, rule, the, reverse, of, the, behavior, of, conventional, optical, materials, to, date, only, metamaterials, exhibit, a, negative, index, of, refraction, single, negative, sng, metamaterials, have, either, negative, relative, permittivity, r, or, negative, relative, permeability, r, but, not, both, they, act, as, metamaterials, when, combined, with, a, different, complementary, sng, jointly, acting, as, a, dng, epsilon, negative, media, eng, display, a, negative, r, while, r, is, positive, many, plasmas, exhibit, this, characteristic, for, example, noble, metals, such, as, gold, or, silver, are, eng, in, the, infrared, and, visible, spectrums, mu, negative, media, mng, display, a, positive, r, and, negative, r, gyrotropic, or, gyromagnetic, materials, exhibit, this, characteristic, a, gyrotropic, material, is, one, that, has, been, altered, by, the, presence, of, a, quasistatic, magnetic, field, enabling, a, magneto, optic, effect, a, magneto, optic, effect, is, a, phenomenon, in, which, an, electromagnetic, wave, propagates, through, such, a, medium, in, such, a, material, left, and, right, rotating, elliptical, polarizations, can, propagate, at, different, speeds, when, light, is, transmitted, through, a, layer, of, magneto, optic, material, the, result, is, called, the, faraday, effect, the, polarization, plane, can, be, rotated, forming, a, faraday, rotator, the, results, of, such, a, reflection, are, known, as, the, magneto, optic, kerr, effect, not, to, be, confused, with, the, nonlinear, kerr, effect, two, gyrotropic, materials, with, reversed, rotation, directions, of, the, two, principal, polarizations, are, called, optical, isomers, joining, a, slab, of, eng, material, and, slab, of, mng, material, resulted, in, properties, such, as, resonances, anomalous, tunneling, transparency, and, zero, reflection, like, negative, index, materials, sngs, are, innately, dispersive, so, their, r, r, and, refraction, index, n, are, a, function, of, frequency, hyperbolic, metamaterials, hmms, behave, as, a, metal, for, certain, polarization, or, direction, of, light, propagation, and, behave, as, a, dielectric, for, the, other, due, to, the, negative, and, positive, permittivity, tensor, components, giving, extreme, anisotropy, the, material, s, dispersion, relation, in, wavevector, space, forms, a, hyperboloid, and, therefore, it, is, called, a, hyperbolic, metamaterial, the, extreme, anisotropy, of, hmms, leads, to, directional, propagation, of, light, within, and, on, the, surface, hmms, have, showed, various, potential, applications, such, as, sensing, reflection, modulator, imaging, steering, of, optical, signals, enhanced, plasmon, resonance, effects, electromagnetic, bandgap, metamaterials, ebg, or, ebm, control, light, propagation, this, is, accomplished, either, with, photonic, crystals, pc, or, left, handed, materials, lhm, pcs, can, prohibit, light, propagation, altogether, both, classes, can, allow, light, to, propagate, in, specific, designed, directions, and, both, can, be, designed, with, bandgaps, at, desired, frequencies, the, period, size, of, ebgs, is, an, appreciable, fraction, of, the, wavelength, creating, constructive, and, destructive, interference, pc, are, distinguished, from, sub, wavelength, structures, such, as, tunable, metamaterials, because, the, pc, derives, its, properties, from, its, bandgap, characteristics, pcs, are, sized, to, match, the, wavelength, of, light, versus, other, metamaterials, that, expose, sub, wavelength, structure, furthermore, pcs, function, by, diffracting, light, in, contrast, metamaterial, does, not, use, diffraction, pcs, have, periodic, inclusions, that, inhibit, wave, propagation, due, to, the, inclusions, destructive, interference, from, scattering, the, photonic, bandgap, property, of, pcs, makes, them, the, electromagnetic, analog, of, electronic, semi, conductor, crystals, ebgs, have, the, goal, of, creating, high, quality, low, loss, periodic, dielectric, structures, an, ebg, affects, photons, in, the, same, way, semiconductor, materials, affect, electrons, pcs, are, the, perfect, bandgap, material, because, they, allow, no, light, propagation, each, unit, of, the, prescribed, periodic, structure, acts, like, one, atom, albeit, of, a, much, larger, size, ebgs, are, designed, to, prevent, the, propagation, of, an, allocated, bandwidth, of, frequencies, for, certain, arrival, angles, and, polarizations, various, geometries, and, structures, have, been, proposed, to, fabricate, ebg, s, special, properties, in, practice, it, is, impossible, to, build, a, flawless, ebg, device, ebgs, have, been, manufactured, for, frequencies, ranging, from, a, few, gigahertz, ghz, to, a, few, terahertz, thz, radio, microwave, and, mid, infrared, frequency, regions, ebg, application, developments, include, a, transmission, line, woodpiles, made, of, square, dielectric, bars, and, several, different, types, of, low, gain, antennas, double, positive, mediums, dps, do, occur, in, nature, such, as, naturally, occurring, dielectrics, permittivity, and, magnetic, permeability, are, both, positive, and, wave, propagation, is, in, the, forward, direction, artificial, materials, have, been, fabricated, which, combine, dps, eng, and, mng, properties, categorizing, metamaterials, into, double, or, single, negative, or, double, positive, normally, assumes, that, the, metamaterial, has, independent, electric, and, magnetic, responses, described, by, and, however, in, many, cases, the, electric, field, causes, magnetic, polarization, while, the, magnetic, field, induces, electrical, polarization, known, as, magnetoelectric, coupling, such, media, are, denoted, as, bi, isotropic, media, that, exhibit, magnetoelectric, coupling, and, that, are, anisotropic, which, is, the, case, for, many, metamaterial, structures, are, referred, to, as, bi, anisotropic, four, material, parameters, are, intrinsic, to, magnetoelectric, coupling, of, bi, isotropic, media, they, are, the, electric, e, and, magnetic, h, field, strengths, and, electric, d, and, magnetic, b, flux, densities, these, parameters, are, and, or, permittivity, permeability, strength, of, chirality, and, the, tellegen, parameter, respectively, in, this, type, of, media, material, parameters, do, not, vary, with, changes, along, a, rotated, coordinate, system, of, measurements, in, this, sense, they, are, invariant, or, scalar, the, intrinsic, magnetoelectric, parameters, and, affect, the, phase, of, the, wave, the, effect, of, the, chirality, parameter, is, to, split, the, refractive, index, in, isotropic, media, this, results, in, wave, propagation, only, if, and, have, the, same, sign, in, bi, isotropic, media, with, assumed, to, be, zero, and, a, non, zero, value, different, results, appear, either, a, backward, wave, or, a, forward, wave, can, occur, alternatively, two, forward, waves, or, two, backward, waves, can, occur, depending, on, the, strength, of, the, chirality, parameter, in, the, general, case, the, constitutive, relations, for, bi, anisotropic, materials, read, d, e, h, displaystyle, mathbf, d, varepsilon, mathbf, e, xi, mathbf, h, b, e, h, displaystyle, mathbf, b, zeta, mathbf, e, mu, mathbf, h, where, displaystyle, varepsilon, and, displaystyle, mu, are, the, permittivity, and, the, permeability, tensors, respectively, whereas, displaystyle, xi, and, displaystyle, zeta, are, the, two, magneto, electric, tensors, if, the, medium, is, reciprocal, permittivity, and, permeability, are, symmetric, tensors, and, t, i, t, displaystyle, xi, zeta, t, i, kappa, t, where, displaystyle, kappa, is, the, chiral, tensor, describing, chiral, electromagnetic, and, reciprocal, magneto, electric, response, the, chiral, tensor, can, be, expressed, as, 1, 3, tr, i, n, j, displaystyle, kappa, tfrac, 1, 3, operatorname, tr, kappa, i, n, j, where, tr, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, kappa, is, the, trace, of, displaystyle, kappa, i, is, the, identity, matrix, n, is, a, symmetric, trace, free, tensor, and, j, is, an, antisymmetric, tensor, such, decomposition, allows, us, to, classify, the, reciprocal, bianisotropic, response, and, we, can, identify, the, following, three, main, classes, i, chiral, media, tr, 0, n, 0, j, 0, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, kappa, neq, 0, n, neq, 0, j, 0, ii, pseudochiral, media, tr, 0, n, 0, j, 0, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, kappa, 0, n, neq, 0, j, 0, iii, omega, media, tr, 0, n, 0, j, 0, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, kappa, 0, n, 0, j, neq, 0, handedness, of, metamaterials, is, a, potential, source, of, confusion, as, the, metamaterial, literature, includes, two, conflicting, uses, of, the, terms, left, and, right, handed, the, first, refers, to, one, of, the, two, circularly, polarized, waves, that, are, the, propagating, modes, in, chiral, media, the, second, relates, to, the, triplet, of, electric, field, magnetic, field, and, poynting, vector, that, arise, in, negative, refractive, index, media, which, in, most, cases, are, not, chiral, generally, a, chiral, and, or, bianisotropic, electromagnetic, response, is, a, consequence, of, 3d, geometrical, chirality, 3d, chiral, metamaterials, are, composed, by, embedding, 3d, chiral, structures, in, a, host, medium, and, they, show, chirality, related, polarization, effects, such, as, optical, activity, and, circular, dichroism, the, concept, of, 2d, chirality, also, exists, and, a, planar, object, is, said, to, be, chiral, if, it, cannot, be, superposed, onto, its, mirror, image, unless, it, is, lifted, from, the, plane, 2d, chiral, metamaterials, that, are, anisotropic, and, lossy, have, been, observed, to, exhibit, directionally, asymmetric, transmission, reflection, absorption, of, circularly, polarized, waves, due, to, circular, conversion, dichrosim, on, the, other, hand, bianisotropic, response, can, arise, from, geometrical, achiral, structures, possessing, neither, 2d, nor, 3d, intrinsic, chirality, plum, and, colleagues, investigated, magneto, electric, coupling, due, to, extrinsic, chirality, where, the, arrangement, of, a, achiral, structure, together, with, the, radiation, wave, vector, is, different, from, its, mirror, image, and, observed, large, tuneable, linear, optical, activity, nonlinear, optical, activity, specular, optical, activity, and, circular, conversion, dichroism, rizza, et, al, suggested, 1d, chiral, metamaterials, where, the, effective, chiral, tensor, is, not, vanishing, if, the, system, is, geometrically, one, dimensional, chiral, the, mirror, image, of, the, entire, structure, cannot, be, superposed, onto, it, by, using, translations, without, rotations, 3d, chiral, metamaterials, are, constructed, from, chiral, materials, or, resonators, in, which, the, effective, chirality, parameter, displaystyle, kappa, is, non, zero, wave, propagation, properties, in, such, chiral, metamaterials, demonstrate, that, negative, refraction, can, be, realized, in, metamaterials, with, a, strong, chirality, and, positive, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, this, is, because, the, refractive, index, n, displaystyle, n, has, distinct, values, for, left, and, right, circularly, polarized, waves, given, by, it, can, be, seen, that, a, negative, index, will, occur, for, one, polarization, if, displaystyle, kappa, r, r, displaystyle, sqrt, varepsilon, r, mu, r, in, this, case, it, is, not, necessary, that, either, or, both, r, displaystyle, varepsilon, r, and, r, displaystyle, mu, r, be, negative, for, backward, wave, propagation, a, negative, refractive, index, due, to, chirality, was, first, observed, simultaneously, and, independently, by, plum, et, al, and, zhang, et, al, in, 2009, frequency, selective, surface, based, metamaterials, block, signals, in, one, waveband, and, pass, those, at, another, waveband, they, have, become, an, alternative, to, fixed, frequency, metamaterials, they, allow, for, optional, changes, of, frequencies, in, a, single, medium, rather, than, the, restrictive, limitations, of, a, fixed, frequency, response, these, metamaterials, use, different, parameters, to, achieve, a, negative, index, of, refraction, in, materials, that, are, not, electromagnetic, furthermore, a, new, design, for, elastic, metamaterials, that, can, behave, either, as, liquids, or, solids, over, a, limited, frequency, range, may, enable, new, applications, based, on, the, control, of, acoustic, elastic, and, seismic, waves, they, are, also, called, mechanical, metamaterials, acoustic, metamaterials, control, direct, and, manipulate, sound, in, the, form, of, sonic, infrasonic, or, ultrasonic, waves, in, gases, liquids, and, solids, as, with, electromagnetic, waves, sonic, waves, can, exhibit, negative, refraction, control, of, sound, waves, is, mostly, accomplished, through, the, bulk, modulus, mass, density, and, chirality, the, bulk, modulus, and, density, are, analogs, of, permittivity, and, permeability, in, electromagnetic, metamaterials, related, to, this, is, the, mechanics, of, sound, wave, propagation, in, a, lattice, structure, also, materials, have, mass, and, intrinsic, degrees, of, stiffness, together, these, form, a, resonant, system, and, the, mechanical, sonic, resonance, may, be, excited, by, appropriate, sonic, frequencies, for, example, audible, pulses, structural, metamaterials, provide, properties, such, as, crushability, and, light, weight, using, projection, micro, stereolithography, microlattices, can, be, created, using, forms, much, like, trusses, and, girders, materials, four, orders, of, magnitude, stiffer, than, conventional, aerogel, but, with, the, same, density, have, been, created, such, materials, can, withstand, a, load, of, at, least, 160, 000, times, their, own, weight, by, over, constraining, the, materials, a, ceramic, nanotruss, metamaterial, can, be, flattened, and, revert, to, its, original, state, typically, materials, found, in, nature, when, homogeneous, are, thermally, isotropic, that, is, to, say, heat, passes, through, them, at, roughly, the, same, rate, in, all, directions, however, thermal, metamaterials, are, anisotropic, usually, due, to, their, highly, organized, internal, structure, composite, materials, with, highly, aligned, internal, particles, or, structures, such, as, fibers, and, carbon, nanotubes, cnt, are, examples, of, this, metamaterials, may, be, fabricated, that, include, some, form, of, nonlinear, media, whose, properties, change, with, the, power, of, the, incident, wave, nonlinear, media, are, essential, for, nonlinear, optics, most, optical, materials, have, a, relatively, weak, response, meaning, that, their, properties, change, by, only, a, small, amount, for, large, changes, in, the, intensity, of, the, electromagnetic, field, the,
