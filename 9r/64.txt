the, coulomb, symbol, c, is, the, unit, of, electric, charge, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, equal, to, the, electric, charge, delivered, by, a, 1, ampere, current, in, 1, second, and, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, elementary, charge, e, at, about, 6, 241, 509, 10, 18, e, the, coulomb, is, named, after, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, as, with, every, si, unit, named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, c, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, coulomb, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, by, 1878, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, had, defined, the, volt, ohm, and, farad, but, not, the, coulomb, in, 1881, the, international, electrical, congress, now, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, approved, the, volt, as, the, unit, for, electromotive, force, the, ampere, as, the, unit, for, electric, current, and, the, coulomb, as, the, unit, of, electric, charge, at, that, time, the, volt, was, defined, as, the, potential, difference, across, a, conductor, when, a, current, of, one, ampere, dissipates, one, watt, of, power, the, coulomb, later, absolute, coulomb, or, abcoulomb, for, disambiguation, was, part, of, the, emu, system, of, units, the, international, coulomb, based, on, laboratory, specifications, for, its, measurement, was, introduced, by, the, iec, in, 1908, the, entire, set, of, reproducible, units, was, abandoned, in, 1948, and, the, international, coulomb, became, the, modern, coulomb, the, si, defines, the, coulomb, by, taking, the, value, of, the, elementary, charge, e, to, be, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, but, was, previously, defined, in, terms, of, the, force, between, two, wires, the, coulomb, was, originally, defined, using, the, latter, definition, of, the, ampere, as, 1, a, 1, s, the, 2019, redefinition, of, the, ampere, and, other, si, base, units, fixed, the, numerical, value, of, the, elementary, charge, when, expressed, in, coulombs, and, therefore, fixed, the, value, of, the, coulomb, when, expressed, as, a, multiple, of, the, fundamental, charge, one, coulomb, is, approximately, 6, 241, 509, 074, 460, 762, 607, 776, e, and, is, thus, not, an, integer, multiple, of, the, elementary, charge, where, the, number, is, the, reciprocal, of, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, the, coulomb, is, exactly, 1, c, 1, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, e, displaystyle, 1, mathrm, c, frac, 1, 1, 602, 176, 634, times, 10, 19, e, like, other, si, units, the, coulomb, can, be, modified, by, adding, a, prefix, that, multiplies, it, by, a, power, of, 10
