metamorphic, rocks, arise, from, the, transformation, of, existing, rock, to, new, types, of, rock, in, a, process, called, metamorphism, the, original, rock, protolith, is, subjected, to, temperatures, greater, than, 150, to, 200, c, 300, to, 400, f, and, often, elevated, pressure, of, 100, megapascals, 1, 000, bar, or, more, causing, profound, physical, or, chemical, changes, during, this, process, the, rock, remains, mostly, in, the, solid, state, but, gradually, recrystallizes, to, a, new, texture, or, mineral, composition, the, protolith, may, be, an, igneous, sedimentary, or, existing, metamorphic, rock, metamorphic, rocks, make, up, a, large, part, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, form, 12, of, the, earth, s, land, surface, they, are, classified, by, their, protolith, their, chemical, and, mineral, makeup, and, their, texture, they, may, be, formed, simply, by, being, deeply, buried, beneath, the, earth, s, surface, where, they, are, subject, to, high, temperatures, and, the, great, pressure, of, the, rock, layers, above, they, can, also, form, from, tectonic, processes, such, as, continental, collisions, which, cause, horizontal, pressure, friction, and, distortion, metamorphic, rock, can, be, formed, locally, when, rock, is, heated, by, the, intrusion, of, hot, molten, rock, called, magma, from, the, earth, s, interior, the, study, of, metamorphic, rocks, now, exposed, at, the, earth, s, surface, following, erosion, and, uplift, provides, information, about, the, temperatures, and, pressures, that, occur, at, great, depths, within, the, earth, s, crust, some, examples, of, metamorphic, rocks, are, gneiss, slate, marble, schist, and, quartzite, slate, and, quartzite, tiles, are, used, in, building, construction, marble, is, also, prized, for, building, construction, and, as, a, medium, for, sculpture, on, the, other, hand, schist, bedrock, can, pose, a, challenge, for, civil, engineering, because, of, its, pronounced, planes, of, weakness, metamorphic, rocks, form, one, of, the, three, great, divisions, of, rock, types, they, are, distinguished, from, igneous, rocks, which, form, from, molten, magma, and, sedimentary, rocks, which, form, from, sediments, eroded, from, existing, rock, or, precipitated, chemically, from, bodies, of, water, metamorphic, rocks, are, formed, when, existing, rock, is, transformed, physically, or, chemically, at, elevated, temperature, without, actually, melting, to, any, great, degree, the, importance, of, heating, in, the, formation, of, metamorphic, rock, was, first, noted, by, the, pioneering, scottish, naturalist, james, hutton, who, is, often, described, as, the, father, of, modern, geology, hutton, wrote, in, 1795, that, some, rock, beds, of, the, scottish, highlands, had, originally, been, sedimentary, rock, but, had, been, transformed, by, great, heat, hutton, also, speculated, that, pressure, was, important, in, metamorphism, this, hypothesis, was, tested, by, his, friend, james, hall, who, sealed, chalk, into, a, makeshift, pressure, vessel, constructed, from, a, cannon, barrel, and, heated, it, in, an, iron, foundry, furnace, hall, found, that, this, produced, a, material, strongly, resembling, marble, rather, than, the, usual, quicklime, produced, by, heating, of, chalk, in, the, open, air, french, geologists, subsequently, added, metasomatism, the, circulation, of, fluids, through, buried, rock, to, the, list, of, processes, that, help, bring, about, metamorphism, however, metamorphism, can, take, place, without, metasomatism, isochemical, metamorphism, or, at, depths, of, just, a, few, hundred, meters, where, pressures, are, relatively, low, for, example, in, contact, metamorphism, metamorphic, processes, change, the, texture, or, mineral, composition, of, the, metamorphosed, rock, metasomatism, can, change, the, bulk, composition, of, a, rock, hot, fluids, circulating, through, pore, space, in, the, rock, can, dissolve, existing, minerals, and, precipitate, new, minerals, dissolved, substances, are, transported, out, of, the, rock, by, the, fluids, while, new, substances, are, brought, in, by, fresh, fluids, this, can, obviously, change, the, mineral, makeup, of, the, rock, however, changes, in, the, mineral, composition, can, take, place, even, when, the, bulk, composition, of, the, rock, does, not, change, this, is, possible, because, all, minerals, are, stable, only, within, certain, limits, of, temperature, pressure, and, chemical, environment, for, example, at, atmospheric, pressure, the, mineral, kyanite, transforms, to, andalusite, at, a, temperature, of, about, 190, c, 374, f, andalusite, in, turn, transforms, to, sillimanite, when, the, temperature, reaches, about, 800, c, 1, 470, f, all, three, have, the, identical, composition, al, 2, sio, 5, likewise, forsterite, is, stable, over, a, broad, range, of, pressure, and, temperature, in, marble, but, is, converted, to, pyroxene, at, elevated, pressure, and, temperature, in, more, silicate, rich, rock, containing, plagioclase, with, which, the, forsterite, reacts, chemically, many, complex, high, temperature, reactions, may, take, place, between, minerals, without, them, melting, and, each, mineral, assemblage, produced, indicates, the, temperatures, and, pressures, at, the, time, of, metamorphism, these, reactions, are, possible, because, of, rapid, diffusion, of, atoms, at, elevated, temperature, pore, fluid, between, mineral, grains, can, be, an, important, medium, through, which, atoms, are, exchanged, the, change, in, the, particle, size, of, the, rock, during, the, process, of, metamorphism, is, called, recrystallization, for, instance, the, small, calcite, crystals, in, the, sedimentary, rock, limestone, and, chalk, change, into, larger, crystals, in, the, metamorphic, rock, marble, in, metamorphosed, sandstone, recrystallization, of, the, original, quartz, sand, grains, results, in, very, compact, quartzite, also, known, as, metaquartzite, in, which, the, often, larger, quartz, crystals, are, interlocked, both, high, temperatures, and, pressures, contribute, to, recrystallization, high, temperatures, allow, the, atoms, and, ions, in, solid, crystals, to, migrate, thus, reorganizing, the, crystals, while, high, pressures, cause, solution, of, the, crystals, within, the, rock, at, their, point, of, contact, metamorphic, rocks, are, characterized, by, their, distinctive, mineral, composition, and, texture, because, every, mineral, is, stable, only, within, certain, limits, the, presence, of, certain, minerals, in, metamorphic, rocks, indicates, the, approximate, temperatures, and, pressures, at, which, the, rock, underwent, metamorphism, these, minerals, are, known, as, index, minerals, examples, include, sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, andalusite, and, some, garnet, other, minerals, such, as, olivines, pyroxenes, hornblende, micas, feldspars, and, quartz, may, be, found, in, metamorphic, rocks, but, are, not, necessarily, the, result, of, the, process, of, metamorphism, these, minerals, can, also, form, during, the, crystallization, of, igneous, rocks, they, are, stable, at, high, temperatures, and, pressures, and, may, remain, chemically, unchanged, during, the, metamorphic, process, metamorphic, rocks, are, typically, more, coarsely, crystalline, than, the, protolith, from, which, they, formed, atoms, in, the, interior, of, a, crystal, are, surrounded, by, a, stable, arrangement, of, neighboring, atoms, this, is, partially, missing, at, the, surface, of, the, crystal, producing, a, surface, energy, that, makes, the, surface, thermodynamically, unstable, recrystallization, to, coarser, crystals, reduces, the, surface, area, and, so, minimizes, the, surface, energy, although, grain, coarsening, is, a, common, result, of, metamorphism, rock, that, is, intensely, deformed, may, eliminate, strain, energy, by, recrystallizing, as, a, fine, grained, rock, called, mylonite, certain, kinds, of, rock, such, as, those, rich, in, quartz, carbonate, minerals, or, olivine, are, particularly, prone, to, form, mylonites, while, feldspar, and, garnet, are, resistant, to, mylonitization, many, kinds, of, metamorphic, rocks, show, a, distinctive, layering, called, foliation, derived, from, the, latin, word, folia, meaning, leaves, foliation, develops, when, a, rock, is, being, shortened, along, one, axis, during, recrystallization, this, causes, crystals, of, platy, minerals, such, as, mica, and, chlorite, to, become, rotated, such, that, their, short, axes, are, parallel, to, the, direction, of, shortening, this, results, in, a, banded, or, foliated, rock, with, the, bands, showing, the, colors, of, the, minerals, that, formed, them, foliated, rock, often, develops, planes, of, cleavage, slate, is, an, example, of, a, foliated, metamorphic, rock, originating, from, shale, and, it, typically, shows, well, developed, cleavage, that, allows, slate, to, be, split, into, thin, plates, the, type, of, foliation, that, develops, depends, on, the, metamorphic, grade, for, instance, starting, with, a, mudstone, the, following, sequence, develops, with, increasing, temperature, the, mudstone, is, first, converted, to, slate, which, is, a, very, fine, grained, foliated, metamorphic, rock, characteristic, of, very, low, grade, metamorphism, slate, in, turn, is, converted, to, phyllite, which, is, fine, grained, and, found, in, areas, of, low, grade, metamorphism, schist, is, medium, to, coarse, grained, and, found, in, areas, of, medium, grade, metamorphism, high, grade, metamorphism, transforms, the, rock, to, gneiss, which, is, coarse, to, very, coarse, grained, rocks, that, were, subjected, to, uniform, pressure, from, all, sides, or, those, that, lack, minerals, with, distinctive, growth, habits, will, not, be, foliated, marble, lacks, platy, minerals, and, is, generally, not, foliated, which, allows, its, use, as, a, material, for, sculpture, and, architecture, metamorphic, rocks, are, one, of, the, three, great, divisions, of, all, rock, types, and, so, there, is, a, great, variety, of, metamorphic, rock, types, in, general, if, the, protolith, of, a, metamorphic, rock, can, be, determined, the, rock, is, described, by, adding, the, prefix, meta, to, the, protolith, rock, name, for, example, if, the, protolith, is, known, to, be, basalt, the, rock, will, be, described, as, a, metabasalt, likewise, a, metamorphic, rock, whose, protolith, is, known, to, be, a, conglomerate, will, be, described, as, a, metaconglomerate, for, a, metamorphic, rock, to, be, classified, in, this, manner, the, protolith, should, be, identifiable, from, the, characteristics, of, the, metamorphic, rock, itself, and, not, inferred, from, other, information, under, the, british, geological, survey, s, classification, system, if, all, that, can, be, determined, about, the, protolith, is, its, general, type, such, as, sedimentary, or, volcanic, the, classification, is, based, on, the, mineral, mode, the, volume, percentages, of, different, minerals, in, the, rock, metasedimentary, rocks, are, divided, into, carbonate, rich, rock, metacarbonates, or, calcsilicate, rocks, or, carbonate, poor, rocks, and, the, latter, are, further, classified, by, the, relative, abundance, of, mica, in, their, composition, this, ranges, from, low, mica, psammite, through, semipelite, to, high, mica, pelite, psammites, composed, mostly, of, quartz, are, classified, as, quartzite, metaigneous, rocks, are, classified, similarly, to, igneous, rocks, by, silica, content, from, meta, ultramafic, rock, which, is, very, low, in, silica, to, metafelsic, rock, with, a, high, silica, content, where, the, mineral, mode, cannot, be, determined, as, is, often, the, case, when, rock, is, first, examined, in, the, field, then, classification, must, be, based, on, texture, the, textural, types, are, a, hornfels, is, a, granofels, that, is, known, to, result, from, contact, metamorphism, a, slate, is, a, fine, grained, metamorphic, rock, that, easily, splits, into, thin, plates, but, shows, no, obvious, compositional, layering, the, term, is, used, only, when, very, little, else, is, known, about, the, rock, that, would, allow, a, more, definite, classification, textural, classifications, may, be, prefixed, to, indicate, a, sedimentary, protolith, para, such, as, paraschist, or, igneous, protolith, ortho, such, as, orthogneiss, when, nothing, is, known, about, the, protolith, the, textural, name, is, used, without, a, prefix, for, example, a, schist, is, a, rock, with, schistose, texture, whose, protolith, is, uncertain, special, classifications, exist, for, metamorphic, rocks, with, a, volcaniclastic, protolith, or, formed, along, a, fault, or, through, hydrothermal, circulation, a, few, special, names, are, used, for, rocks, of, unknown, protolith, but, known, modal, composition, such, as, marble, eclogite, or, amphibolite, special, names, may, also, be, applied, more, generally, to, rocks, dominated, by, a, single, mineral, or, with, a, distinctive, composition, or, mode, or, origin, special, names, still, in, wide, use, include, amphibolite, greenschist, phyllite, marble, serpentinite, eclogite, migmatite, skarn, granulite, mylonite, and, slate, the, basic, classification, can, be, supplemented, by, terms, describing, mineral, content, or, texture, for, example, a, metabasalt, showing, weak, schistosity, might, be, described, as, a, gneissic, metabasalt, and, a, pelite, containing, abundant, staurolite, might, be, described, as, a, staurolite, pelite, a, metamorphic, facies, is, a, set, of, distinctive, assemblages, of, minerals, that, are, found, in, metamorphic, rock, that, formed, under, a, specific, combination, of, pressure, and, temperature, the, particular, assemblage, is, somewhat, dependent, on, the, composition, of, that, protolith, so, that, for, example, the, amphibolite, facies, of, a, marble, will, not, be, identical, with, the, amphibolite, facies, of, a, pelite, however, the, facies, are, defined, such, that, metamorphic, rock, with, as, broad, a, range, of, compositions, as, is, practical, can, be, assigned, to, a, particular, facies, the, present, definition, of, metamorphic, facies, is, largely, based, on, the, work, of, the, finnish, geologist, pentti, eskola, with, refinements, based, on, subsequent, experimental, work, eskola, drew, upon, the, zonal, schemes, based, on, index, minerals, that, were, pioneered, by, the, british, geologist, george, barrow, the, metamorphic, facies, is, not, usually, considered, when, classifying, metamorphic, rock, based, on, protolith, mineral, mode, or, texture, however, a, few, metamorphic, facies, produce, rock, of, such, distinctive, character, that, the, facies, name, is, used, for, the, rock, when, more, precise, classification, is, not, possible, the, chief, examples, are, amphibolite, and, eclogite, the, british, geological, survey, strongly, discourages, the, use, of, granulite, as, a, classification, for, rock, metamorphosed, to, the, granulite, facies, instead, such, rock, will, often, be, classified, as, a, granofels, however, this, approach, is, not, universally, accepted, metamorphic, rocks, make, up, a, large, part, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, form, 12, of, the, earth, s, land, surface, the, lower, continental, crust, is, mostly, metamafic, rock, and, pelite, which, have, reached, the, granulite, facies, the, middle, continental, crust, is, dominated, by, metamorphic, rock, that, has, reached, the, amphibolite, facies, within, the, upper, crust, which, is, the, only, part, of, the, earth, s, crust, geologists, can, directly, sample, metamorphic, rock, forms, only, from, processes, that, can, occur, at, shallow, depth, these, are, contact, thermal, metamorphism, dynamic, cataclastic, metamorphism, hydrothermal, metamorphism, and, impact, metamorphism, these, processes, are, relatively, local, in, occurrence, and, usually, reach, only, the, low, pressure, facies, such, as, the, hornfels, and, sanidinite, facies, most, metamorphic, rock, is, formed, by, regional, metamorphism, in, the, middle, and, lower, crust, where, the, rock, reaches, the, higher, pressure, metamorphic, facies, this, rock, is, found, at, the, surface, only, where, extensive, uplift, and, erosion, has, exhumed, rock, that, was, formerly, much, deeper, in, the, crust, metamorphic, rock, is, extensively, exposed, in, orogenic, belts, produced, by, the, collision, of, tectonic, plates, at, convergent, boundaries, here, formerly, deeply, buried, rock, has, been, brought, to, the, surface, by, uplift, and, erosion, the, metamorphic, rock, exposed, in, orogenic, belts, may, have, been, metamorphosed, simply, by, being, at, great, depths, below, the, earth, s, surface, subjected, to, high, temperatures, and, the, great, pressure, caused, by, the, immense, weight, of, the, rock, layers, above, this, kind, of, regional, metamorphism, is, known, as, burial, metamorphism, this, tends, to, produce, low, grade, metamorphic, rock, much, more, common, is, metamorphic, rock, formed, during, the, collision, process, itself, the, collision, of, plates, causes, high, temperatures, pressures, and, deformation, in, the, rocks, along, these, belts, metamorphic, rock, formed, in, these, settings, tends, to, shown, well, developed, schistosity, metamorphic, rock, of, orogenic, belts, shows, a, variety, of, metamorphic, facies, where, subduction, is, taking, place, the, basalt, of, the, subducting, slab, is, metamorphosed, to, high, pressure, metamorphic, facies, it, initially, undergoes, low, grade, metamorphism, to, metabasalt, of, the, zeolite, and, prehnite, pumpellyite, facies, but, as, the, basalt, subducts, to, greater, depths, it, is, metamorphosed, to, the, blueschist, facies, and, then, the, eclogite, facies, metamorphism, to, the, eclogite, facies, releases, a, great, deal, of, water, vapor, from, the, rock, which, drives, volcanism, in, the, overlying, volcanic, arc, eclogite, is, also, significantly, denser, than, blueschist, which, drives, further, subduction, of, the, slab, deep, into, the, earth, s, mantle, metabasalt, and, blueschist, may, be, preserved, in, blueschist, metamorphic, belts, formed, by, collisions, between, continents, they, may, also, be, preserved, by, obduction, onto, the, overriding, plate, as, part, of, ophiolites, eclogites, are, occasionally, found, at, sites, of, continental, collision, where, the, subducted, rock, is, rapidly, brought, back, to, the, surface, before, it, can, be, converted, to, the, granulite, facies, in, the, hot, upper, mantle, many, samples, of, eclogite, are, xenoliths, brought, to, the, surface, by, volcanic, activity, many, orogenic, belts, contain, higher, temperature, lower, pressure, metamorphic, belts, these, may, form, through, heating, of, the, rock, by, ascending, magmas, of, volcanic, arcs, but, on, a, regional, scale, deformation, and, crustal, thickening, in, an, orogenic, belt, may, also, produce, these, kinds, of, metamorphic, rocks, these, rocks, reach, the, greenschist, amphibolite, or, granulite, facies, and, are, the, most, common, of, metamorphic, rocks, produced, by, regional, metamorphosis, the, association, of, an, outer, high, pressure, low, temperature, metamorphic, zone, with, an, inner, zone, of, low, pressure, high, temperature, metamorphic, rocks, is, called, a, paired, metamorphic, belt, the, main, islands, of, japan, show, three, distinct, paired, metamorphic, belts, corresponding, to, different, episodes, of, subduction, metamorphic, rock, is, also, exposed, in, metamorphic, core, complexes, which, form, in, region, of, crustal, extension, they, are, characterized, by, low, angle, faulting, that, exposes, domes, of, middle, or, lower, crust, metamorphic, rock, these, were, first, recognized, and, studied, in, the, basin, and, range, province, of, southwestern, north, america, but, are, also, found, in, southern, aegean, sea, in, the, d, entrecasteaux, islands, and, in, other, areas, of, extension, continental, shields, are, regions, of, exposed, ancient, rock, that, make, up, the, stable, cores, of, continents, the, rock, exposed, in, the, oldest, regions, of, shields, which, is, of, archean, age, over, 2500, million, years, old, mostly, belong, to, granite, greenstone, belts, the, greenstone, belts, contain, metavolcanic, and, metasedimentary, rock, that, has, undergone, a, relatively, mild, grade, of, metamorphism, at, temperatures, of, 350, 500, c, 662, 932, f, and, pressures, of, 200, 500, mpa, 2, 000, 5, 000, bar, they, can, be, divided, into, a, lower, group, of, metabasalts, including, rare, meta, komatiites, a, middle, group, of, meta, intermediate, rock, and, meta, felsic, rock, and, an, upper, group, of, metasedimentary, rock, the, greenstone, belts, are, surrounded, by, high, grade, gneiss, terrains, showing, highly, deformed, low, pressure, high, temperature, over, 500, c, 932, f, metamorphism, to, the, amphibolite, or, granulite, facies, these, form, most, of, the, exposed, rock, in, archean, cratons, the, granite, greenstone, belts, are, intruded, by, a, distinctive, group, of, granitic, rocks, called, the, tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite, or, ttg, suite, these, are, the, most, voluminous, rocks, in, the, craton, and, may, represent, an, important, early, phase, in, the, formation, of, continental, crust, mid, ocean, ridges, are, where, new, oceanic, crust, is, formed, as, tectonic, plates, move, apart, hydrothermal, metamorphism, is, extensive, here, this, is, characterized, by, metasomatism, by, hot, fluids, circulating, through, the, rock, this, produces, metamorphic, rock, of, the, greenschist, facies, the, metamorphic, rock, serpentinite, is, particularly, characteristic, of, these, settings, and, represents, chemical, transformation, of, olivine, and, pyroxene, in, ultramafic, rock, to, serpentine, group, minerals, contact, metamorphism, takes, place, when, magma, is, injected, into, the, surrounding, solid, rock, country, rock, the, changes, that, occur, are, greatest, wherever, the, magma, comes, into, contact, with, the, rock, because, the, temperatures, are, highest, at, this, boundary, and, decrease, with, distance, from, it, around, the, igneous, rock, that, forms, from, the, cooling, magma, is, a, metamorphosed, zone, called, a, contact, aureole, aureoles, may, show, all, degrees, of, metamorphism, from, the, contact, area, to, unmetamorphosed, unchanged, country, rock, some, distance, away, the, formation, of, important, ore, minerals, may, occur, by, the, process, of, metasomatism, at, or, near, the, contact, zone, contact, aureoles, around, large, plutons, may, be, as, much, as, several, kilometers, wide, the, term, hornfels, is, often, used, by, geologists, to, signify, those, fine, grained, compact, non, foliated, products, of, contact, metamorphism, the, contact, aureole, typically, shows, little, deformation, and, so, hornfels, is, usually, devoid, of, schistosity, and, forms, a, tough, equigranular, rock, if, the, rock, was, originally, banded, or, foliated, as, for, example, a, laminated, sandstone, or, a, foliated, calc, schist, this, character, may, not, be, obliterated, and, a, banded, hornfels, is, the, product, contact, metamorphism, close, to, the, surface, produces, distinctive, low, pressure, metamorphic, minerals, such, as, spinel, andalusite, vesuvianite, or, wollastonite, similar, changes, may, be, induced, in, shales, by, the, burning, of, coal, seams, this, produces, a, rock, type, named, clinker, there, is, also, a, tendency, for, metasomatism, between, the, igneous, magma, and, sedimentary, country, rock, whereby, the, chemicals, in, each, are, exchanged, or, introduced, into, the, other, in, that, case, hybrid, rocks, called, skarn, arise, dynamic, cataclastic, metamorphism, takes, place, locally, along, faults, here, intense, shearing, of, the, rock, typically, forms, mylonites, impact, metamorphism, is, unlike, other, forms, of, metamorphism, in, that, it, takes, place, during, impact, events, by, extraterrestrial, bodies, it, produces, rare, ultrahigh, pressure, metamorphic, minerals, such, as, coesite, and, stishovite, coesite, is, rarely, found, in, eclogite, brought, to, the, surface, in, kimberlite, pipes, but, the, presence, of, stishovite, is, unique, to, impact, structures, slate, tiles, are, used, in, construction, particularly, as, roof, shingle, quartzite, is, sufficiently, hard, and, dense, that, it, is, difficult, to, quarry, however, some, quartzite, is, used, as, dimension, stone, often, as, slabs, for, flooring, walls, or, stairsteps, about, 6, of, crushed, stone, used, mostly, for, road, aggregate, is, quartzite, marble, is, also, prized, for, building, construction, and, as, a, medium, for, sculpture, schistose, bedrock, can, pose, a, challenge, for, civil, engineering, because, of, its, pronounced, planes, of, weakness, a, hazard, may, exist, even, in, undisturbed, terrain, on, august, 17, 1959, a, magnitude, 7, 2, earthquake, destabilized, a, mountain, slope, near, hebgen, lake, montana, composed, of, schist, this, caused, a, massive, landslide, that, killed, 26, people, camping, in, the, area, metamorphosed, ultramafic, rock, contains, serpentine, group, minerals, which, includes, varieties, of, asbestos, that, pose, a, hazard, to, human, health
