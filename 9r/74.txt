the, byte, is, a, unit, of, digital, information, that, most, commonly, consists, of, eight, bits, historically, the, byte, was, the, number, of, bits, used, to, encode, a, single, character, of, text, in, a, computer, and, for, this, reason, it, is, the, smallest, addressable, unit, of, memory, in, many, computer, architectures, to, disambiguate, arbitrarily, sized, bytes, from, the, common, 8, bit, definition, network, protocol, documents, such, as, the, internet, protocol, rfc, 791, refer, to, an, 8, bit, byte, as, an, octet, those, bits, in, an, octet, are, usually, counted, with, numbering, from, 0, to, 7, or, 7, to, 0, depending, on, the, bit, endianness, the, size, of, the, byte, has, historically, been, hardware, dependent, and, no, definitive, standards, existed, that, mandated, the, size, sizes, from, 1, to, 48, bits, have, been, used, the, six, bit, character, code, was, an, often, used, implementation, in, early, encoding, systems, and, computers, using, six, bit, and, nine, bit, bytes, were, common, in, the, 1960s, these, systems, often, had, memory, words, of, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, or, 60, bits, corresponding, to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or, 10, six, bit, bytes, in, this, era, bit, groupings, in, the, instruction, stream, were, often, referred, to, as, syllables, or, slab, before, the, term, byte, became, common, the, modern, de, facto, standard, of, eight, bits, as, documented, in, iso, iec, 2382, 1, 1993, is, a, convenient, power, of, two, permitting, the, binary, encoded, values, 0, through, 255, for, one, byte, as, 2, to, the, power, of, 8, is, 256, the, international, standard, iec, 80000, 13, codified, this, common, meaning, many, types, of, applications, use, information, representable, in, eight, or, fewer, bits, and, processor, designers, commonly, optimize, for, this, usage, the, popularity, of, major, commercial, computing, architectures, has, aided, in, the, ubiquitous, acceptance, of, the, 8, bit, byte, modern, architectures, typically, use, 32, or, 64, bit, words, built, of, four, or, eight, bytes, respectively, the, unit, symbol, for, the, byte, was, designated, as, the, upper, case, letter, b, by, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, and, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, internationally, the, unit, octet, symbol, o, explicitly, defines, a, sequence, of, eight, bits, eliminating, the, potential, ambiguity, of, the, term, byte, the, term, byte, was, coined, by, werner, buchholz, in, june, 1956, during, the, early, design, phase, for, the, ibm, stretch, computer, which, had, addressing, to, the, bit, and, variable, field, length, vfl, instructions, with, a, byte, size, encoded, in, the, instruction, it, is, a, deliberate, respelling, of, bite, to, avoid, accidental, mutation, to, bit, another, origin, of, byte, for, bit, groups, smaller, than, a, computer, s, word, size, and, in, particular, groups, of, four, bits, is, on, record, by, louis, g, dooley, who, claimed, he, coined, the, term, while, working, with, jules, schwartz, and, dick, beeler, on, an, air, defense, system, called, sage, at, mit, lincoln, laboratory, in, 1956, or, 1957, which, was, jointly, developed, by, rand, mit, and, ibm, later, on, schwartz, s, language, jovial, actually, used, the, term, but, the, author, recalled, vaguely, that, it, was, derived, from, an, fsq, 31, early, computers, used, a, variety, of, four, bit, binary, coded, decimal, bcd, representations, and, the, six, bit, codes, for, printable, graphic, patterns, common, in, the, u, s, army, fieldata, and, navy, these, representations, included, alphanumeric, characters, and, special, graphical, symbols, these, sets, were, expanded, in, 1963, to, seven, bits, of, coding, called, the, american, standard, code, for, information, interchange, ascii, as, the, federal, information, processing, standard, which, replaced, the, incompatible, teleprinter, codes, in, use, by, different, branches, of, the, u, s, government, and, universities, during, the, 1960s, ascii, included, the, distinction, of, upper, and, lowercase, alphabets, and, a, set, of, control, characters, to, facilitate, the, transmission, of, written, language, as, well, as, printing, device, functions, such, as, page, advance, and, line, feed, and, the, physical, or, logical, control, of, data, flow, over, the, transmission, media, during, the, early, 1960s, while, also, active, in, ascii, standardization, ibm, simultaneously, introduced, in, its, product, line, of, system, 360, the, eight, bit, extended, binary, coded, decimal, interchange, code, ebcdic, an, expansion, of, their, six, bit, binary, coded, decimal, bcdic, representations, used, in, earlier, card, punches, the, prominence, of, the, system, 360, led, to, the, ubiquitous, adoption, of, the, eight, bit, storage, size, while, in, detail, the, ebcdic, and, ascii, encoding, schemes, are, different, in, the, early, 1960s, at, t, introduced, digital, telephony, on, long, distance, trunk, lines, these, used, the, eight, bit, law, encoding, this, large, investment, promised, to, reduce, transmission, costs, for, eight, bit, data, in, volume, 1, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, first, published, in, 1968, donald, knuth, uses, byte, in, his, hypothetical, mix, computer, to, denote, a, unit, which, contains, an, unspecified, amount, of, information, capable, of, holding, at, least, 64, distinct, values, at, most, 100, distinct, values, on, a, binary, computer, a, byte, must, therefore, be, composed, of, six, bits, he, notes, that, since, 1975, or, so, the, word, byte, has, come, to, mean, a, sequence, of, precisely, eight, binary, digits, when, we, speak, of, bytes, in, connection, with, mix, we, shall, confine, ourselves, to, the, former, sense, of, the, word, harking, back, to, the, days, when, bytes, were, not, yet, standardized, the, development, of, eight, bit, microprocessors, in, the, 1970s, popularized, this, storage, size, microprocessors, such, as, the, intel, 8080, the, direct, predecessor, of, the, 8086, could, also, perform, a, small, number, of, operations, on, the, four, bit, pairs, in, a, byte, such, as, the, decimal, add, adjust, daa, instruction, a, four, bit, quantity, is, often, called, a, nibble, also, nybble, which, is, conveniently, represented, by, a, single, hexadecimal, digit, the, term, octet, is, used, to, unambiguously, specify, a, size, of, eight, bits, it, is, used, extensively, in, protocol, definitions, historically, the, term, octad, or, octade, was, used, to, denote, eight, bits, as, well, at, least, in, western, europe, however, this, usage, is, no, longer, common, the, exact, origin, of, the, term, is, unclear, but, it, can, be, found, in, british, dutch, and, german, sources, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, throughout, the, documentation, of, philips, mainframe, computers, the, unit, symbol, for, the, byte, is, specified, in, iec, 80000, 13, ieee, 1541, and, the, metric, interchange, format, as, the, upper, case, character, b, in, the, international, system, of, quantities, isq, b, is, also, the, symbol, of, the, bel, a, unit, of, logarithmic, power, ratio, named, after, alexander, graham, bell, creating, a, conflict, with, the, iec, specification, however, little, danger, of, confusion, exists, because, the, bel, is, a, rarely, used, unit, it, is, used, primarily, in, its, decadic, fraction, the, decibel, db, for, signal, strength, and, sound, pressure, level, measurements, while, a, unit, for, one, tenth, of, a, byte, the, decibyte, and, other, fractions, are, only, used, in, derived, units, such, as, transmission, rates, the, lowercase, letter, o, for, octet, is, defined, as, the, symbol, for, octet, in, iec, 80000, 13, and, is, commonly, used, in, languages, such, as, french, and, romanian, and, is, also, combined, with, metric, prefixes, for, multiples, for, example, ko, and, mo, more, than, one, system, exists, to, define, unit, multiples, based, on, the, byte, some, systems, are, based, on, powers, of, 10, following, the, international, system, of, units, si, which, defines, for, example, the, prefix, kilo, as, 1000, 10, 3, other, systems, are, based, on, powers, of, 2, nomenclature, for, these, systems, has, led, to, confusion, systems, based, on, powers, of, 10, use, standard, si, prefixes, kilo, mega, giga, and, their, corresponding, symbols, k, m, g, systems, based, on, powers, of, 2, however, might, use, binary, prefixes, kibi, mebi, gibi, and, their, corresponding, symbols, ki, mi, gi, or, they, might, use, the, prefixes, k, m, and, g, creating, ambiguity, when, the, prefixes, m, or, g, are, used, while, the, difference, between, the, decimal, and, binary, interpretations, is, relatively, small, for, the, kilobyte, about, 2, smaller, than, the, kibibyte, the, systems, deviate, increasingly, as, units, grow, larger, the, relative, deviation, grows, by, 2, 4, for, each, three, orders, of, magnitude, for, example, a, power, of, 10, based, terabyte, is, about, 9, smaller, than, power, of, 2, based, tebibyte, definition, of, prefixes, using, powers, of, 10, in, which, 1, kilobyte, symbol, kb, is, defined, to, equal, 1, 000, bytes, is, recommended, by, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, the, iec, standard, defines, eight, such, multiples, up, to, 1, yottabyte, yb, equal, to, 1000, 8, bytes, the, additional, prefixes, ronna, for, 1000, 9, and, quetta, for, 1000, 10, were, adopted, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, in, 2022, this, definition, is, most, commonly, used, for, data, rate, units, in, computer, networks, internal, bus, hard, drive, and, flash, media, transfer, speeds, and, for, the, capacities, of, most, storage, media, particularly, hard, drives, flash, based, storage, and, dvds, operating, systems, that, use, this, definition, include, macos, ios, ubuntu, and, debian, it, is, also, consistent, with, the, other, uses, of, the, si, prefixes, in, computing, such, as, cpu, clock, speeds, or, measures, of, performance, a, system, of, units, based, on, powers, of, 2, in, which, 1, kibibyte, kib, is, equal, to, 1, 024, i, e, 2, 10, bytes, is, defined, by, international, standard, iec, 80000, 13, and, is, supported, by, national, and, international, standards, bodies, bipm, iec, nist, the, iec, standard, defines, eight, such, multiples, up, to, 1, yobibyte, yib, equal, to, 1024, 8, bytes, the, natural, binary, counterparts, to, ronna, and, quetta, were, given, in, a, consultation, paper, of, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, consultative, committee, for, units, ccu, as, robi, ri, 1024, 9, and, quebi, qi, 1024, 10, but, have, not, yet, been, adopted, by, the, iec, and, iso, an, alternative, system, of, nomenclature, for, the, same, units, referred, to, here, as, the, customary, convention, in, which, 1, kilobyte, kb, is, equal, to, 1, 024, bytes, 1, megabyte, mb, is, equal, to, 1024, 2, bytes, and, 1, gigabyte, gb, is, equal, to, 1024, 3, bytes, is, mentioned, by, a, 1990s, jedec, standard, only, the, first, three, multiples, up, to, gb, are, mentioned, by, the, jedec, standard, which, makes, no, mention, of, tb, and, larger, while, confusing, and, incorrect, the, customary, convention, is, used, by, the, microsoft, windows, operating, system, and, random, access, memory, capacity, such, as, main, memory, and, cpu, cache, size, and, in, marketing, and, billing, by, telecommunication, companies, such, as, vodafone, at, t, orange, and, telstra, for, storage, capacity, the, customary, convention, was, used, by, macos, and, ios, through, mac, os, x, 10, 6, snow, leopard, and, ios, 10, after, which, they, switched, to, units, based, on, powers, of, 10, various, computer, vendors, have, coined, terms, for, data, of, various, sizes, sometimes, with, different, sizes, for, the, same, term, even, within, a, single, vendor, these, terms, include, double, word, half, word, long, word, quad, word, slab, superword, and, syllable, there, are, also, informal, terms, e, g, half, byte, and, nybble, for, 4, bits, octal, k, for, 1000, 8, contemporary, computer, memory, has, a, binary, architecture, making, a, definition, of, memory, units, based, on, powers, of, 2, most, practical, the, use, of, the, metric, prefix, kilo, for, binary, multiples, arose, as, a, convenience, because, 1, 024, is, approximately, 1, 000, this, definition, was, popular, in, early, decades, of, personal, computing, with, products, like, the, tandon, 5, 1, 4, inch, dd, floppy, format, holding, 368, 640, bytes, being, advertised, as, 360, kb, following, the, 1, 024, byte, convention, it, was, not, universal, however, the, shugart, sa, 400, 5, 1, 4, inch, floppy, disk, held, 109, 375, bytes, unformatted, and, was, advertised, as, 110, kbyte, using, the, 1000, convention, likewise, the, 8, inch, dec, rx01, floppy, 1975, held, 256, 256, bytes, formatted, and, was, advertised, as, 256k, some, devices, were, advertised, using, a, mixture, of, the, two, definitions, most, notably, floppy, disks, advertised, as, 1, 44, mb, have, an, actual, capacity, of, 1, 440, kib, the, equivalent, of, 1, 47, mb, or, 1, 41, mib, in, 1995, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, s, iupac, interdivisional, committee, on, nomenclature, and, symbols, attempted, to, resolve, this, ambiguity, by, proposing, a, set, of, binary, prefixes, for, the, powers, of, 1024, including, kibi, kilobinary, mebi, megabinary, and, gibi, gigabinary, in, december, 1998, the, iec, addressed, such, multiple, usages, and, definitions, by, adopting, the, iupac, s, proposed, prefixes, kibi, mebi, gibi, etc, to, unambiguously, denote, powers, of, 1024, thus, one, kibibyte, 1, kib, is, 1024, 1, bytes, 1024, bytes, one, mebibyte, 1, mib, is, 1024, 2, bytes, 1, 048, 576, bytes, and, so, on, in, 1999, donald, knuth, suggested, calling, the, kibibyte, a, large, kilobyte, kkb, the, iec, adopted, the, iupac, proposal, and, published, the, standard, in, january, 1999, the, iec, prefixes, are, part, of, the, international, system, of, quantities, the, iec, further, specified, that, the, kilobyte, should, only, be, used, to, refer, to, 1, 000, bytes, lawsuits, arising, from, alleged, consumer, confusion, over, the, binary, and, decimal, definitions, of, multiples, of, the, byte, have, generally, ended, in, favor, of, the, manufacturers, with, courts, holding, that, the, legal, definition, of, gigabyte, or, gb, is, 1, gb, 1, 000, 000, 000, 10, 9, bytes, the, decimal, definition, rather, than, the, binary, definition, 2, 30, i, e, 1, 073, 741, 824, specifically, the, united, states, district, court, for, the, northern, district, of, california, held, that, the, u, s, congress, has, deemed, the, decimal, definition, of, gigabyte, to, be, the, preferred, one, for, the, purposes, of, u, s, trade, and, commerce, the, california, legislature, has, likewise, adopted, the, decimal, system, for, all, transactions, in, this, state, earlier, lawsuits, had, ended, in, settlement, with, no, court, ruling, on, the, question, such, as, a, lawsuit, against, drive, manufacturer, western, digital, western, digital, settled, the, challenge, and, added, explicit, disclaimers, to, products, that, the, usable, capacity, may, differ, from, the, advertised, capacity, seagate, was, sued, on, similar, grounds, and, also, settled, many, programming, languages, define, the, data, type, byte, the, c, and, c, programming, languages, define, byte, as, an, addressable, unit, of, data, storage, large, enough, to, hold, any, member, of, the, basic, character, set, of, the, execution, environment, clause, 3, 6, of, the, c, standard, the, c, standard, requires, that, the, integral, data, type, unsigned, char, must, hold, at, least, 256, different, values, and, is, represented, by, at, least, eight, bits, clause, 5, 2, 4, 2, 1, various, implementations, of, c, and, c, reserve, 8, 9, 16, 32, or, 36, bits, for, the, storage, of, a, byte, in, addition, the, c, and, c, standards, require, that, there, are, no, gaps, between, two, bytes, this, means, every, bit, in, memory, is, part, of, a, byte, java, s, primitive, data, type, byte, is, defined, as, eight, bits, it, is, a, signed, data, type, holding, values, from, 128, to, 127, net, programming, languages, such, as, c, define, byte, as, an, unsigned, type, and, the, sbyte, as, a, signed, data, type, holding, values, from, 0, to, 255, and, 128, to, 127, respectively, in, data, transmission, systems, the, byte, is, used, as, a, contiguous, sequence, of, bits, in, a, serial, data, stream, representing, the, smallest, distinguished, unit, of, data, for, asynchronous, communication, a, full, transmission, unit, usually, additionally, includes, a, start, bit, 1, or, 2, stop, bits, and, possibly, a, parity, bit, and, thus, its, size, may, vary, from, seven, to, twelve, bits, for, five, to, eight, bits, of, actual, data, for, synchronous, communication, the, error, checking, usually, uses, bytes, at, the, end, of, a, frame, terms, used, here, to, describe, the, structure, imposed, by, the, machine, design, in, addition, to, bit, are, listed, below, byte, denotes, a, group, of, bits, used, to, encode, a, character, or, the, number, of, bits, transmitted, in, parallel, to, and, from, input, output, units, a, term, other, than, character, is, used, here, because, a, given, character, may, be, represented, in, different, applications, by, more, than, one, code, and, different, codes, may, use, different, numbers, of, bits, i, e, different, byte, sizes, in, input, output, transmission, the, grouping, of, bits, may, be, completely, arbitrary, and, have, no, relation, to, actual, characters, the, term, is, coined, from, bite, but, respelled, to, avoid, accidental, mutation, to, bit, a, word, consists, of, the, number, of, data, bits, transmitted, in, parallel, from, or, to, memory, in, one, memory, cycle, word, size, is, thus, defined, as, a, structural, property, of, the, memory, the, term, catena, was, coined, for, this, purpose, by, the, designers, of, the, bull, gamma, 60, computer, block, refers, to, the, number, of, words, transmitted, to, or, from, an, input, output, unit, in, response, to, a, single, input, output, instruction, block, size, is, a, structural, property, of, an, input, output, unit, it, may, have, been, fixed, by, the, design, or, left, to, be, varied, by, the, program, most, important, from, the, point, of, view, of, editing, will, be, the, ability, to, handle, any, characters, or, digits, from, 1, to, 6, bits, long, figure, 2, shows, the, shift, matrix, to, be, used, to, convert, a, 60, bit, word, coming, from, memory, in, parallel, into, characters, or, bytes, as, we, have, called, them, to, be, sent, to, the, adder, serially, the, 60, bits, are, dumped, into, magnetic, cores, on, six, different, levels, thus, if, a, 1, comes, out, of, position, 9, it, appears, in, all, six, cores, underneath, pulsing, any, diagonal, line, will, send, the, six, bits, stored, along, that, line, to, the, adder, the, adder, may, accept, all, or, only, some, of, the, bits, assume, that, it, is, desired, to, operate, on, 4, bit, decimal, digits, starting, at, the, right, the, 0, diagonal, is, pulsed, first, sending, out, the, six, bits, 0, to, 5, of, which, the, adder, accepts, only, the, first, four, 0, 3, bits, 4, and, 5, are, ignored, next, the, 4, diagonal, is, pulsed, this, sends, out, bits, 4, to, 9, of, which, the, last, two, are, again, ignored, and, so, on, it, is, just, as, easy, to, use, all, six, bits, in, alphanumeric, work, or, to, handle, bytes, of, only, one, bit, for, logical, analysis, or, to, offset, the, bytes, by, any, number, of, bits, all, this, can, be, done, by, pulling, the, appropriate, shift, diagonals, an, analogous, matrix, arrangement, is, used, to, change, from, serial, to, parallel, operation, at, the, output, of, the, adder, byte, a, string, that, consists, of, a, number, of, bits, treated, as, a, unit, and, usually, representing, a, character, or, a, part, of, a, character, notes, 1, the, number, of, bits, in, a, byte, is, fixed, for, a, given, data, processing, system, 2, the, number, of, bits, in, a, byte, is, usually, 8, we, received, the, following, from, w, buchholz, one, of, the, individuals, who, was, working, on, ibm, s, project, stretch, in, the, mid, 1950s, his, letter, tells, the, story, not, being, a, regular, reader, of, your, magazine, i, heard, about, the, question, in, the, november, 1976, issue, regarding, the, origin, of, the, term, byte, from, a, colleague, who, knew, that, i, had, perpetrated, this, piece, of, jargon, i, searched, my, files, and, could, not, locate, a, birth, certificate, but, i, am, sure, that, byte, is, coming, of, age, in, 1977, with, its, 21st, birthday, many, have, assumed, that, byte, meaning, 8, bits, originated, with, the, ibm, system, 360, which, spread, such, bytes, far, and, wide, in, the, mid, 1960s, the, editor, is, correct, in, pointing, out, that, the, term, goes, back, to, the, earlier, stretch, computer, but, incorrect, in, that, stretch, was, the, first, not, the, last, of, ibm, s, second, generation, transistorized, computers, to, be, developed, the, first, reference, found, in, the, files, was, contained, in, an, internal, memo, written, in, june, 1956, during, the, early, days, of, developing, stretch, a, byte, was, described, as, consisting, of, any, number, of, parallel, bits, from, one, to, six, thus, a, byte, was, assumed, to, have, a, length, appropriate, for, the, occasion, its, first, use, was, in, the, context, of, the, input, output, equipment, of, the, 1950s, which, handled, six, bits, at, a, time, the, possibility, of, going, to, 8, bit, bytes, was, considered, in, august, 1956, and, incorporated, in, the, design, of, stretch, shortly, thereafter, the, first, published, reference, to, the, term, occurred, in, 1959, in, a, paper, processing, data, in, bits, and, pieces, by, g, a, blaauw, f, p, brooks, jr, and, w, buchholz, in, the, ire, transactions, on, electronic, computers, june, 1959, page, 121, the, notions, of, that, paper, were, elaborated, in, chapter, 4, of, planning, a, computer, system, project, stretch, edited, by, w, buchholz, mcgraw, hill, book, company, 1962, the, rationale, for, coining, the, term, was, explained, there, on, page, 40, as, follows, byte, denotes, a, group, of, bits, used, to, encode, a, character, or, the, number, of, bits, transmitted, in, parallel, to, and, from, input, output, units, a, term, other, than, character, is, used, here, because, a, given, character, may, be, represented, in, different, applications, by, more, than, one, code, and, different, codes, may, use, different, numbers, of, bits, ie, different, byte, sizes, in, input, output, transmission, the, grouping, of, bits, may, be, completely, arbitrary, and, have, no, relation, to, actual, characters, the, term, is, coined, from, bite, but, respelled, to, avoid, accidental, mutation, to, bit, system, 360, took, over, many, of, the, stretch, concepts, including, the, basic, byte, and, word, sizes, which, are, powers, of, 2, for, economy, however, the, byte, size, was, fixed, at, the, 8, bit, maximum, and, addressing, at, the, bit, level, was, replaced, by, byte, addressing, since, then, the, term, byte, has, generally, meant, 8, bits, and, it, has, thus, passed, into, the, general, vocabulary, are, there, any, other, terms, coined, especially, for, the, computer, field, which, have, found, their, way, into, general, dictionaries, of, english, language, 1956, summer, gerrit, blaauw, fred, brooks, werner, buchholz, john, cocke, and, jim, pomerene, join, the, stretch, team, lloyd, hunter, provides, transistor, leadership, 1956, july, in, a, report, werner, buchholz, lists, the, advantages, of, a, 64, bit, word, length, for, stretch, it, also, supports, nsa, s, requirement, for, 8, bit, bytes, werner, s, term, byte, first, popularized, in, this, memo, nb, this, timeline, erroneously, specifies, the, birth, date, of, the, term, byte, as, july, 1956, while, buchholz, actually, used, the, term, as, early, as, june, 1956, 60, is, a, multiple, of, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and, 6, hence, bytes, of, length, from, 1, to, 6, bits, can, be, packed, efficiently, into, a, 60, bit, word, without, having, to, split, a, byte, between, one, word, and, the, next, if, longer, bytes, were, needed, 60, bits, would, of, course, no, longer, be, ideal, with, present, applications, 1, 4, and, 6, bits, are, the, really, important, cases, with, 64, bit, words, it, would, often, be, necessary, to, make, some, compromises, such, as, leaving, 4, bits, unused, in, a, word, when, dealing, with, 6, bit, bytes, at, the, input, and, output, however, the, link, computer, can, be, equipped, to, edit, out, these, gaps, and, to, permit, handling, of, bytes, which, are, split, between, words, the, maximum, input, output, byte, size, for, serial, operation, will, now, be, 8, bits, not, counting, any, error, detection, and, correction, bits, thus, the, exchange, will, operate, on, an, 8, bit, byte, basis, and, any, input, output, units, with, less, than, 8, bits, per, byte, will, leave, the, remaining, bits, blank, the, resultant, gaps, can, be, edited, out, later, by, programming, i, came, to, work, for, ibm, and, saw, all, the, confusion, caused, by, the, 64, character, limitation, especially, when, we, started, to, think, about, word, processing, which, would, require, both, upper, and, lower, case, add, 26, lower, case, letters, to, 47, existing, and, one, got, 73, 9, more, than, 6, bits, could, represent, i, even, made, a, proposal, in, view, of, stretch, the, very, first, computer, i, know, of, with, an, 8, bit, byte, that, would, extend, the, number, of, punch, card, character, codes, to, 256, some, folks, took, it, seriously, i, thought, of, it, as, a, spoof, so, some, folks, started, thinking, about, 7, bit, characters, but, this, was, ridiculous, with, ibm, s, stretch, computer, as, background, handling, 64, character, words, divisible, into, groups, of, 8, i, designed, the, character, set, for, it, under, the, guidance, of, dr, werner, buchholz, the, man, who, did, coin, the, term, byte, for, an, 8, bit, grouping, it, seemed, reasonable, to, make, a, universal, 8, bit, character, set, handling, up, to, 256, in, those, days, my, mantra, was, powers, of, 2, are, magic, and, so, the, group, i, headed, developed, and, justified, such, a, proposal, that, was, a, little, too, much, progress, when, presented, to, the, standards, group, that, was, to, formalize, ascii, so, they, stopped, short, for, the, moment, with, a, 7, bit, set, or, else, an, 8, bit, set, with, the, upper, half, left, for, future, work, the, ibm, 360, used, 8, bit, characters, although, not, ascii, directly, thus, buchholz, s, byte, caught, on, everywhere, i, myself, did, not, like, the, name, for, many, reasons, the, design, had, 8, bits, moving, around, in, parallel, but, then, came, a, new, ibm, part, with, 9, bits, for, self, checking, both, inside, the, cpu, and, in, the, tape, drives, i, exposed, this, 9, bit, byte, to, the, press, in, 1973, but, long, before, that, when, i, headed, software, operations, for, cie, bull, in, france, in, 1965, 66, i, insisted, that, byte, be, deprecated, in, favor, of, octet, you, can, notice, that, my, preference, then, is, now, the, preferred, term, it, is, justified, by, new, communications, methods, that, can, carry, 16, 32, 64, and, even, 128, bits, in, parallel, but, some, foolish, people, now, refer, to, a, 16, bit, byte, because, of, this, parallel, transfer, which, is, visible, in, the, unicode, set, i, m, not, sure, but, maybe, this, should, be, called, a, hextet, but, you, will, notice, that, i, am, still, correct, powers, of, 2, are, still, magic, the, word, byte, was, coined, around, 1956, to, 1957, at, mit, lincoln, laboratories, within, a, project, called, sage, the, north, american, air, defense, system, which, was, jointly, developed, by, rand, lincoln, labs, and, ibm, in, that, era, computer, memory, structure, was, already, defined, in, terms, of, word, size, a, word, consisted, of, x, number, of, bits, a, bit, represented, a, binary, notational, position, in, a, word, operations, typically, operated, on, all, the, bits, in, the, full, word, we, coined, the, word, byte, to, refer, to, a, logical, set, of, bits, less, than, a, full, word, size, at, that, time, it, was, not, defined, specifically, as, x, bits, but, typically, referred, to, as, a, set, of, 4, bits, as, that, was, the, size, of, most, of, our, coded, data, items, shortly, afterward, i, went, on, to, other, responsibilities, that, removed, me, from, sage, after, having, spent, many, years, in, asia, i, returned, to, the, u, s, and, was, bemused, to, find, out, that, the, word, byte, was, being, used, in, the, new, microcomputer, technology, to, refer, to, the, basic, addressable, memory, unit, a, question, and, answer, session, at, an, acm, conference, on, the, history, of, programming, languages, included, this, exchange, john, goodenough, you, mentioned, that, the, term, byte, is, used, in, jovial, where, did, the, term, come, from, jules, schwartz, inventor, of, jovial, as, i, recall, the, an, fsq, 31, a, totally, different, computer, than, the, 709, was, byte, oriented, i, don, t, recall, for, sure, but, i, m, reasonably, certain, the, description, of, that, computer, included, the, word, byte, and, we, used, it, fred, brooks, may, i, speak, to, that, werner, buchholz, coined, the, word, as, part, of, the, definition, of, stretch, and, the, an, fsq, 31, picked, it, up, from, stretch, but, werner, is, very, definitely, the, author, of, that, word, schwartz, that, s, right, thank, you
