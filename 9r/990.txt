https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference
in, physics, and, astronomy, a, frame, of, reference, or, reference, frame, is, an, abstract, coordinate, system, whose, origin, orientation, and, scale, are, specified, by, a, set, of, reference, points, geometric, points, whose, position, is, identified, both, mathematically, with, numerical, coordinate, values, and, physically, signaled, by, conventional, markers, an, important, special, case, is, that, of, inertial, reference, frames, a, stationary, or, uniformly, moving, frame, for, n, dimensions, n, 1, reference, points, are, sufficient, to, fully, define, a, reference, frame, using, rectangular, cartesian, coordinates, a, reference, frame, may, be, defined, with, a, reference, point, at, the, origin, and, a, reference, point, at, one, unit, distance, along, each, of, the, n, coordinate, axes, in, einsteinian, relativity, reference, frames, are, used, to, specify, the, relationship, between, a, moving, observer, and, the, phenomenon, under, observation, in, this, context, the, term, often, becomes, observational, frame, of, reference, or, observational, reference, frame, which, implies, that, the, observer, is, at, rest, in, the, frame, although, not, necessarily, located, at, its, origin, a, relativistic, reference, frame, includes, or, implies, the, coordinate, time, which, does, not, equate, across, different, reference, frames, moving, relatively, to, each, other, the, situation, thus, differs, from, galilean, relativity, in, which, all, possible, coordinate, times, are, essentially, equivalent, the, need, to, distinguish, between, the, various, meanings, of, frame, of, reference, has, led, to, a, variety, of, terms, for, example, sometimes, the, type, of, coordinate, system, is, attached, as, a, modifier, as, in, cartesian, frame, of, reference, sometimes, the, state, of, motion, is, emphasized, as, in, rotating, frame, of, reference, sometimes, the, way, it, transforms, to, frames, considered, as, related, is, emphasized, as, in, galilean, frame, of, reference, sometimes, frames, are, distinguished, by, the, scale, of, their, observations, as, in, macroscopic, and, microscopic, frames, of, reference, in, this, article, the, term, observational, frame, of, reference, is, used, when, emphasis, is, upon, the, state, of, motion, rather, than, upon, the, coordinate, choice, or, the, character, of, the, observations, or, observational, apparatus, in, this, sense, an, observational, frame, of, reference, allows, study, of, the, effect, of, motion, upon, an, entire, family, of, coordinate, systems, that, could, be, attached, to, this, frame, on, the, other, hand, a, coordinate, system, may, be, employed, for, many, purposes, where, the, state, of, motion, is, not, the, primary, concern, for, example, a, coordinate, system, may, be, adopted, to, take, advantage, of, the, symmetry, of, a, system, in, a, still, broader, perspective, the, formulation, of, many, problems, in, physics, employs, generalized, coordinates, normal, modes, or, eigenvectors, which, are, only, indirectly, related, to, space, and, time, it, seems, useful, to, divorce, the, various, aspects, of, a, reference, frame, for, the, discussion, below, we, therefore, take, observational, frames, of, reference, coordinate, systems, and, observational, equipment, as, independent, concepts, separated, as, below, although, the, term, coordinate, system, is, often, used, particularly, by, physicists, in, a, nontechnical, sense, the, term, coordinate, system, does, have, a, precise, meaning, in, mathematics, and, sometimes, that, is, what, the, physicist, means, as, well, a, coordinate, system, in, mathematics, is, a, facet, of, geometry, or, of, algebra, in, particular, a, property, of, manifolds, for, example, in, physics, configuration, spaces, or, phase, spaces, the, coordinates, of, a, point, r, in, an, n, dimensional, space, are, simply, an, ordered, set, of, n, numbers, in, a, general, banach, space, these, numbers, could, be, for, example, coefficients, in, a, functional, expansion, like, a, fourier, series, in, a, physical, problem, they, could, be, spacetime, coordinates, or, normal, mode, amplitudes, in, a, robot, design, they, could, be, angles, of, relative, rotations, linear, displacements, or, deformations, of, joints, here, we, will, suppose, these, coordinates, can, be, related, to, a, cartesian, coordinate, system, by, a, set, of, functions, where, x, y, z, etc, are, the, n, cartesian, coordinates, of, the, point, given, these, functions, coordinate, surfaces, are, defined, by, the, relations, the, intersection, of, these, surfaces, define, coordinate, lines, at, any, selected, point, tangents, to, the, intersecting, coordinate, lines, at, that, point, define, a, set, of, basis, vectors, e, 1, e, 2, e, n, at, that, point, that, is, which, can, be, normalized, to, be, of, unit, length, for, more, detail, see, curvilinear, coordinates, coordinate, surfaces, coordinate, lines, and, basis, vectors, are, components, of, a, coordinate, system, if, the, basis, vectors, are, orthogonal, at, every, point, the, coordinate, system, is, an, orthogonal, coordinate, system, an, important, aspect, of, a, coordinate, system, is, its, metric, tensor, g, ik, which, determines, the, arc, length, ds, in, the, coordinate, system, in, terms, of, its, coordinates, where, repeated, indices, are, summed, over, as, is, apparent, from, these, remarks, a, coordinate, system, is, a, mathematical, construct, part, of, an, axiomatic, system, there, is, no, necessary, connection, between, coordinate, systems, and, physical, motion, or, any, other, aspect, of, reality, however, coordinate, systems, can, include, time, as, a, coordinate, and, can, be, used, to, describe, motion, thus, lorentz, transformations, and, galilean, transformations, may, be, viewed, as, coordinate, transformations, an, observational, frame, of, reference, often, referred, to, as, a, physical, frame, of, reference, a, frame, of, reference, or, simply, a, frame, is, a, physical, concept, related, to, an, observer, and, the, observer, s, state, of, motion, here, we, adopt, the, view, expressed, by, kumar, and, barve, an, observational, frame, of, reference, is, characterized, only, by, its, state, of, motion, however, there, is, lack, of, unanimity, on, this, point, in, special, relativity, the, distinction, is, sometimes, made, between, an, observer, and, a, frame, according, to, this, view, a, frame, is, an, observer, plus, a, coordinate, lattice, constructed, to, be, an, orthonormal, right, handed, set, of, spacelike, vectors, perpendicular, to, a, timelike, vector, see, doran, this, restricted, view, is, not, used, here, and, is, not, universally, adopted, even, in, discussions, of, relativity, in, general, relativity, the, use, of, general, coordinate, systems, is, common, see, for, example, the, schwarzschild, solution, for, the, gravitational, field, outside, an, isolated, sphere, there, are, two, types, of, observational, reference, frame, inertial, and, non, inertial, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, is, defined, as, one, in, which, all, laws, of, physics, take, on, their, simplest, form, in, special, relativity, these, frames, are, related, by, lorentz, transformations, which, are, parametrized, by, rapidity, in, newtonian, mechanics, a, more, restricted, definition, requires, only, that, newton, s, first, law, holds, true, that, is, a, newtonian, inertial, frame, is, one, in, which, a, free, particle, travels, in, a, straight, line, at, constant, speed, or, is, at, rest, these, frames, are, related, by, galilean, transformations, these, relativistic, and, newtonian, transformations, are, expressed, in, spaces, of, general, dimension, in, terms, of, representations, of, the, poincar, group, and, of, the, galilean, group, in, contrast, to, the, inertial, frame, a, non, inertial, frame, of, reference, is, one, in, which, fictitious, forces, must, be, invoked, to, explain, observations, an, example, is, an, observational, frame, of, reference, centered, at, a, point, on, the, earth, s, surface, this, frame, of, reference, orbits, around, the, center, of, the, earth, which, introduces, the, fictitious, forces, known, as, the, coriolis, force, centrifugal, force, and, gravitational, force, all, of, these, forces, including, gravity, disappear, in, a, truly, inertial, reference, frame, which, is, one, of, free, fall, a, further, aspect, of, a, frame, of, reference, is, the, role, of, the, measurement, apparatus, for, example, clocks, and, rods, attached, to, the, frame, see, norton, quote, above, this, question, is, not, addressed, in, this, article, and, is, of, particular, interest, in, quantum, mechanics, where, the, relation, between, observer, and, measurement, is, still, under, discussion, see, measurement, problem, in, physics, experiments, the, frame, of, reference, in, which, the, laboratory, measurement, devices, are, at, rest, is, usually, referred, to, as, the, laboratory, frame, or, simply, lab, frame, an, example, would, be, the, frame, in, which, the, detectors, for, a, particle, accelerator, are, at, rest, the, lab, frame, in, some, experiments, is, an, inertial, frame, but, it, is, not, required, to, be, for, example, the, laboratory, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, in, many, physics, experiments, is, not, inertial, in, particle, physics, experiments, it, is, often, useful, to, transform, energies, and, momenta, of, particles, from, the, lab, frame, where, they, are, measured, to, the, center, of, momentum, frame, com, frame, in, which, calculations, are, sometimes, simplified, since, potentially, all, kinetic, energy, still, present, in, the, com, frame, may, be, used, for, making, new, particles, in, this, connection, it, may, be, noted, that, the, clocks, and, rods, often, used, to, describe, observers, measurement, equipment, in, thought, in, practice, are, replaced, by, a, much, more, complicated, and, indirect, metrology, that, is, connected, to, the, nature, of, the, vacuum, and, uses, atomic, clocks, that, operate, according, to, the, standard, model, and, that, must, be, corrected, for, gravitational, time, dilation, see, second, meter, and, kilogram, in, fact, einstein, felt, that, clocks, and, rods, were, merely, expedient, measuring, devices, and, they, should, be, replaced, by, more, fundamental, entities, based, upon, for, example, atoms, and, molecules, the, discussion, is, taken, beyond, simple, space, time, coordinate, systems, by, brading, and, castellani, extension, to, coordinate, systems, using, generalized, coordinates, underlies, the, hamiltonian, and, lagrangian, formulations, of, quantum, field, theory, classical, relativistic, mechanics, and, quantum, gravity, we, first, introduce, the, notion, of, reference, frame, itself, related, to, the, idea, of, observer, the, reference, frame, is, in, some, sense, the, euclidean, space, carried, by, the, observer, let, us, give, a, more, mathematical, definition, the, reference, frame, is, the, set, of, all, points, in, the, euclidean, space, with, the, rigid, body, motion, of, the, observer, the, frame, denoted, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, is, said, to, move, with, the, observer, the, spatial, positions, of, particles, are, labelled, relative, to, a, frame, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, by, establishing, a, coordinate, system, r, with, origin, o, the, corresponding, set, of, axes, sharing, the, rigid, body, motion, of, the, frame, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, can, be, considered, to, give, a, physical, realization, of, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, in, a, frame, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, coordinates, are, changed, from, r, to, r, by, carrying, out, at, each, instant, of, time, the, same, coordinate, transformation, on, the, components, of, intrinsic, objects, vectors, and, tensors, introduced, to, represent, physical, quantities, in, this, frame, and, this, on, the, utility, of, separating, the, notions, of, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, and, as, noted, by, brillouin, a, distinction, between, mathematical, sets, of, coordinates, and, physical, frames, of, reference, must, be, made, the, ignorance, of, such, distinction, is, the, source, of, much, confusion, the, dependent, functions, such, as, velocity, for, example, are, measured, with, respect, to, a, physical, reference, frame, but, one, is, free, to, choose, any, mathematical, coordinate, system, in, which, the, equations, are, specified, and, this, also, on, the, distinction, between, r, displaystyle, mathfrak, r, and, the, idea, of, a, reference, frame, is, really, quite, different, from, that, of, a, coordinate, system, frames, differ, just, when, they, define, different, spaces, sets, of, rest, points, or, times, sets, of, simultaneous, events, so, the, ideas, of, a, space, a, time, of, rest, and, simultaneity, go, inextricably, together, with, that, of, frame, however, a, mere, shift, of, origin, or, a, purely, spatial, rotation, of, space, coordinates, results, in, a, new, coordinate, system, so, frames, correspond, at, best, to, classes, of, coordinate, systems, and, from, j, d, norton, in, traditional, developments, of, special, and, general, relativity, it, has, been, customary, not, to, distinguish, between, two, quite, distinct, ideas, the, first, is, the, notion, of, a, coordinate, system, understood, simply, as, the, smooth, invertible, assignment, of, four, numbers, to, events, in, spacetime, neighborhoods, the, second, the, frame, of, reference, refers, to, an, idealized, system, used, to, assign, such, numbers, to, avoid, unnecessary, restrictions, we, can, divorce, this, arrangement, from, metrical, notions, of, special, importance, for, our, purposes, is, that, each, frame, of, reference, has, a, definite, state, of, motion, at, each, event, of, spacetime, within, the, context, of, special, relativity, and, as, long, as, we, restrict, ourselves, to, frames, of, reference, in, inertial, motion, then, little, of, importance, depends, on, the, difference, between, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, and, the, inertial, coordinate, system, it, induces, this, comfortable, circumstance, ceases, immediately, once, we, begin, to, consider, frames, of, reference, in, nonuniform, motion, even, within, special, relativity, more, recently, to, negotiate, the, obvious, ambiguities, of, einstein, s, treatment, the, notion, of, frame, of, reference, has, reappeared, as, a, structure, distinct, from, a, coordinate, system
