the, laws, of, thermodynamics, are, a, set, of, scientific, laws, which, define, a, group, of, physical, quantities, such, as, temperature, energy, and, entropy, that, characterize, thermodynamic, systems, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, laws, also, use, various, parameters, for, thermodynamic, processes, such, as, thermodynamic, work, and, heat, and, establish, relationships, between, them, they, state, empirical, facts, that, form, a, basis, of, precluding, the, possibility, of, certain, phenomena, such, as, perpetual, motion, in, addition, to, their, use, in, thermodynamics, they, are, important, fundamental, laws, of, physics, in, general, and, are, applicable, in, other, natural, sciences, traditionally, thermodynamics, has, recognized, three, fundamental, laws, simply, named, by, an, ordinal, identification, the, first, law, the, second, law, and, the, third, law, a, more, fundamental, statement, was, later, labelled, as, the, zeroth, law, after, the, first, three, laws, had, been, established, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, defines, thermal, equilibrium, and, forms, a, basis, for, the, definition, of, temperature, if, two, systems, are, each, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, a, third, system, then, they, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, each, other, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, when, energy, passes, into, or, out, of, a, system, as, work, heat, or, matter, the, system, s, internal, energy, changes, in, accordance, with, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, in, a, natural, thermodynamic, process, the, sum, of, the, entropies, of, the, interacting, thermodynamic, systems, never, decreases, a, common, corollary, of, the, statement, is, that, heat, does, not, spontaneously, pass, from, a, colder, body, to, a, warmer, body, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, a, system, s, entropy, approaches, a, constant, value, as, the, temperature, approaches, absolute, zero, with, the, exception, of, non, crystalline, solids, glasses, the, entropy, of, a, system, at, absolute, zero, is, typically, close, to, zero, the, first, and, second, laws, prohibit, two, kinds, of, perpetual, motion, machines, respectively, the, perpetual, motion, machine, of, the, first, kind, which, produces, work, with, no, energy, input, and, the, perpetual, motion, machine, of, the, second, kind, which, spontaneously, converts, thermal, energy, into, mechanical, work, the, history, of, thermodynamics, is, fundamentally, interwoven, with, the, history, of, physics, and, the, history, of, chemistry, and, ultimately, dates, back, to, theories, of, heat, in, antiquity, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, are, the, result, of, progress, made, in, this, field, over, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, the, first, established, thermodynamic, principle, which, eventually, became, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, was, formulated, by, sadi, carnot, in, 1824, in, his, book, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, by, 1860, as, formalized, in, the, works, of, scientists, such, as, rudolf, clausius, and, william, thomson, what, are, now, known, as, the, first, and, second, laws, were, established, later, nernst, s, theorem, or, nernst, s, postulate, which, is, now, known, as, the, third, law, was, formulated, by, walther, nernst, over, the, period, 1906, 1912, while, the, numbering, of, the, laws, is, universal, today, various, textbooks, throughout, the, 20th, century, have, numbered, the, laws, differently, in, some, fields, the, second, law, was, considered, to, deal, with, the, efficiency, of, heat, engines, only, whereas, what, was, called, the, third, law, dealt, with, entropy, increases, gradually, this, resolved, itself, and, a, zeroth, law, was, later, added, to, allow, for, a, self, consistent, definition, of, temperature, additional, laws, have, been, suggested, but, have, not, achieved, the, generality, of, the, four, accepted, laws, and, are, generally, not, discussed, in, standard, textbooks, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, provides, for, the, foundation, of, temperature, as, an, empirical, parameter, in, thermodynamic, systems, and, establishes, the, transitive, relation, between, the, temperatures, of, multiple, bodies, in, thermal, equilibrium, the, law, may, be, stated, in, the, following, form, if, two, systems, are, both, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, a, third, system, then, they, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, each, other, though, this, version, of, the, law, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, stated, versions, it, is, only, one, of, a, diversity, of, statements, that, are, labeled, as, the, zeroth, law, some, statements, go, further, so, as, to, supply, the, important, physical, fact, that, temperature, is, one, dimensional, and, that, one, can, conceptually, arrange, bodies, in, a, real, number, sequence, from, colder, to, hotter, these, concepts, of, temperature, and, of, thermal, equilibrium, are, fundamental, to, thermodynamics, and, were, clearly, stated, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, name, zeroth, law, was, invented, by, ralph, h, fowler, in, the, 1930s, long, after, the, first, second, and, third, laws, were, widely, recognized, the, law, allows, the, definition, of, temperature, in, a, non, circular, way, without, reference, to, entropy, its, conjugate, variable, such, a, temperature, definition, is, said, to, be, empirical, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, is, a, version, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, adapted, for, thermodynamic, processes, in, general, the, conservation, law, states, that, the, total, energy, of, an, isolated, system, is, constant, energy, can, be, transformed, from, one, form, to, another, but, can, be, neither, created, nor, destroyed, in, a, closed, system, i, e, there, is, no, transfer, of, matter, into, or, out, of, the, system, the, first, law, states, that, the, change, in, internal, energy, of, the, system, u, system, is, equal, to, the, difference, between, the, heat, supplied, to, the, system, q, and, the, work, w, done, by, the, system, on, its, surroundings, note, an, alternate, sign, convention, not, used, in, this, article, is, to, define, w, as, the, work, done, on, the, system, by, its, surroundings, for, processes, that, include, the, transfer, of, matter, a, further, statement, is, needed, when, two, initially, isolated, systems, are, combined, into, a, new, system, then, the, total, internal, energy, of, the, new, system, u, system, will, be, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, internal, energies, of, the, two, initial, systems, u, 1, and, u, 2, the, first, law, encompasses, several, principles, combining, these, principles, leads, to, one, traditional, statement, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, it, is, not, possible, to, construct, a, machine, which, will, perpetually, output, work, without, an, equal, amount, of, energy, input, to, that, machine, or, more, briefly, a, perpetual, motion, machine, of, the, first, kind, is, impossible, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, indicates, the, irreversibility, of, natural, processes, and, in, many, cases, the, tendency, of, natural, processes, to, lead, towards, spatial, homogeneity, of, matter, and, energy, especially, of, temperature, it, can, be, formulated, in, a, variety, of, interesting, and, important, ways, one, of, the, simplest, is, the, clausius, statement, that, heat, does, not, spontaneously, pass, from, a, colder, to, a, hotter, body, it, implies, the, existence, of, a, quantity, called, the, entropy, of, a, thermodynamic, system, in, terms, of, this, quantity, it, implies, that, when, two, initially, isolated, systems, in, separate, but, nearby, regions, of, space, each, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, with, itself, but, not, necessarily, with, each, other, are, then, allowed, to, interact, they, will, eventually, reach, a, mutual, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, sum, of, the, entropies, of, the, initially, isolated, systems, is, less, than, or, equal, to, the, total, entropy, of, the, final, combination, equality, occurs, just, when, the, two, original, systems, have, all, their, respective, intensive, variables, temperature, pressure, equal, then, the, final, system, also, has, the, same, values, the, second, law, is, applicable, to, a, wide, variety, of, processes, both, reversible, and, irreversible, according, to, the, second, law, in, a, reversible, heat, transfer, an, element, of, heat, transferred, q, displaystyle, delta, q, is, the, product, of, the, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, both, of, the, system, and, of, the, sources, or, destination, of, the, heat, with, the, increment, d, s, displaystyle, ds, of, the, system, s, conjugate, variable, its, entropy, s, displaystyle, s, while, reversible, processes, are, a, useful, and, convenient, theoretical, limiting, case, all, natural, processes, are, irreversible, a, prime, example, of, this, irreversibility, is, the, transfer, of, heat, by, conduction, or, radiation, it, was, known, long, before, the, discovery, of, the, notion, of, entropy, that, when, two, bodies, initially, of, different, temperatures, come, into, direct, thermal, connection, then, heat, immediately, and, spontaneously, flows, from, the, hotter, body, to, the, colder, one, entropy, may, also, be, viewed, as, a, physical, measure, concerning, the, microscopic, details, of, the, motion, and, configuration, of, a, system, when, only, the, macroscopic, states, are, known, such, details, are, often, referred, to, as, disorder, on, a, microscopic, or, molecular, scale, and, less, often, as, dispersal, of, energy, for, two, given, macroscopically, specified, states, of, a, system, there, is, a, mathematically, defined, quantity, called, the, difference, of, information, entropy, between, them, this, defines, how, much, additional, microscopic, physical, information, is, needed, to, specify, one, of, the, macroscopically, specified, states, given, the, macroscopic, specification, of, the, other, often, a, conveniently, chosen, reference, state, which, may, be, presupposed, to, exist, rather, than, explicitly, stated, a, final, condition, of, a, natural, process, always, contains, microscopically, specifiable, effects, which, are, not, fully, and, exactly, predictable, from, the, macroscopic, specification, of, the, initial, condition, of, the, process, this, is, why, entropy, increases, in, natural, processes, the, increase, tells, how, much, extra, microscopic, information, is, needed, to, distinguish, the, initial, macroscopically, specified, state, from, the, final, macroscopically, specified, state, equivalently, in, a, thermodynamic, process, energy, spreads, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, can, be, stated, as, a, system, s, entropy, approaches, a, constant, value, as, its, temperature, approaches, absolute, zero, at, absolute, zero, temperature, the, system, is, in, the, state, with, the, minimum, thermal, energy, the, ground, state, the, constant, value, not, necessarily, zero, of, entropy, at, this, point, is, called, the, residual, entropy, of, the, system, with, the, exception, of, non, crystalline, solids, e, g, glass, the, residual, entropy, of, a, system, is, typically, close, to, zero, however, it, reaches, zero, only, when, the, system, has, a, unique, ground, state, i, e, the, state, with, the, minimum, thermal, energy, has, only, one, configuration, or, microstate, microstates, are, used, here, to, describe, the, probability, of, a, system, being, in, a, specific, state, as, each, microstate, is, assumed, to, have, the, same, probability, of, occurring, so, macroscopic, states, with, fewer, microstates, are, less, probable, in, general, entropy, is, related, to, the, number, of, possible, microstates, according, to, the, boltzmann, principle, where, s, is, the, entropy, of, the, system, k, b, boltzmann, s, constant, and, the, number, of, microstates, at, absolute, zero, there, is, only, 1, microstate, possible, 1, as, all, the, atoms, are, identical, for, a, pure, substance, and, as, a, result, all, orders, are, identical, as, there, is, only, one, combination, and, ln, 1, 0, displaystyle, ln, 1, 0, the, onsager, reciprocal, relations, have, been, considered, the, fourth, law, of, thermodynamics, they, describe, the, relation, between, thermodynamic, flows, and, forces, in, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, under, the, assumption, that, thermodynamic, variables, can, be, defined, locally, in, a, condition, of, local, equilibrium, these, relations, are, derived, from, statistical, mechanics, under, the, principle, of, microscopic, reversibility, in, the, absence, of, external, magnetic, fields, given, a, set, of, extensive, parameters, x, i, energy, mass, entropy, number, of, particles, and, so, on, and, thermodynamic, forces, f, i, related, to, their, related, intrinsic, parameters, such, as, temperature, and, pressure, the, onsager, theorem, states, that, where, i, k, 1, 2, 3, index, every, parameter, and, its, related, force, and, are, called, the, thermodynamic, flows
