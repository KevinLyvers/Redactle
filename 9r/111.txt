the, oort, cloud, r, t, r, t, sometimes, called, the, pik, oort, cloud, is, theorized, to, be, a, vast, cloud, of, icy, planetesimals, surrounding, the, sun, at, distances, ranging, from, 2, 000, to, 200, 000, au, 0, 03, to, 3, 2, light, years, the, concept, of, such, a, cloud, was, proposed, in, 1950, by, the, dutch, astronomer, jan, oort, in, whose, honor, the, idea, was, named, oort, proposed, that, the, bodies, in, this, cloud, replenish, and, keep, constant, the, number, of, long, period, comets, entering, the, inner, solar, system, where, they, are, eventually, consumed, and, destroyed, during, close, approaches, to, the, sun, the, cloud, is, thought, to, encompass, two, regions, a, disc, shaped, inner, oort, cloud, aligned, with, the, solar, ecliptic, also, called, its, hills, cloud, and, a, spherical, outer, oort, cloud, enclosing, the, entire, solar, system, both, regions, lie, well, beyond, the, heliosphere, and, are, in, interstellar, space, the, innermost, portion, of, the, oort, cloud, is, more, than, a, thousand, times, as, distant, from, the, sun, as, the, kuiper, belt, the, scattered, disc, and, the, detached, objects, three, nearer, reservoirs, of, trans, neptunian, objects, the, outer, limit, of, the, oort, cloud, defines, the, cosmographic, boundary, of, the, solar, system, this, area, is, defined, by, the, sun, s, hill, sphere, and, hence, lies, at, the, interface, between, solar, and, galactic, gravitational, dominion, the, outer, oort, cloud, is, only, loosely, bound, to, the, solar, system, and, its, constituents, are, easily, affected, by, the, gravitational, pulls, of, both, passing, stars, and, the, milky, way, itself, these, forces, served, to, moderate, and, render, more, circular, the, highly, eccentric, orbits, of, material, ejected, from, the, inner, solar, system, during, its, early, phases, of, development, the, circular, orbits, of, material, in, the, oort, disc, are, largely, thanks, to, this, galactic, gravitational, torquing, by, the, same, token, galactic, interference, in, the, motion, of, oort, bodies, occasionally, dislodges, comets, from, their, orbits, within, the, cloud, sending, them, into, the, inner, solar, system, based, on, their, orbits, most, but, not, all, of, the, short, period, comets, appear, to, have, come, from, the, oort, disc, other, short, period, comets, may, have, originated, from, the, far, larger, spherical, cloud, astronomers, hypothesize, that, the, material, presently, in, the, oort, cloud, formed, much, closer, to, the, sun, in, the, protoplanetary, disc, and, was, then, scattered, far, into, space, through, the, gravitational, influence, of, the, giant, planets, no, direct, observation, of, the, oort, cloud, is, possible, with, present, imaging, technology, nevertheless, the, cloud, is, thought, to, be, the, source, that, replenishes, most, long, period, and, halley, type, comets, which, are, eventually, consumed, by, their, close, approaches, to, the, sun, after, entering, the, inner, solar, system, the, cloud, may, also, serve, the, same, function, for, many, of, the, centaurs, and, jupiter, family, comets, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, understood, that, there, were, two, main, classes, of, comet, short, period, comets, also, called, ecliptic, comets, and, long, period, comets, also, called, nearly, isotropic, comets, ecliptic, comets, have, relatively, small, orbits, aligned, near, the, ecliptic, plane, and, are, not, found, much, farther, than, the, kuiper, cliff, around, 50, au, from, the, sun, the, orbit, of, neptune, averages, about, 30, au, and, 177p, barnard, has, aphelion, around, 48, au, long, period, comets, on, the, other, hand, travel, in, very, large, orbits, thousands, of, au, from, the, sun, and, are, isotropically, distributed, this, means, long, period, comets, appear, from, every, direction, in, the, sky, both, above, and, below, the, ecliptic, plane, the, origin, of, these, comets, was, not, well, understood, and, many, long, period, comets, were, initially, assumed, to, be, on, parabolic, trajectories, making, them, one, time, visitors, to, the, sun, from, interstellar, space, in, 1907, armin, otto, leuschner, suggested, that, many, of, the, comets, then, thought, to, have, parabolic, orbits, in, fact, moved, along, extremely, large, elliptical, orbits, that, would, return, them, to, the, inner, solar, system, after, long, intervals, during, which, they, were, invisible, to, earth, based, astronomy, in, 1932, the, estonian, astronomer, ernst, pik, proposed, a, reservoir, of, long, period, comets, in, the, form, of, an, orbiting, cloud, at, the, outermost, edge, of, the, solar, system, dutch, astronomer, jan, oort, revived, this, basic, idea, in, 1950, to, resolve, a, paradox, about, the, origin, of, comets, the, following, facts, are, not, easily, reconcilable, with, the, highly, elliptical, orbits, in, which, long, period, comets, are, always, found, oort, reasoned, that, comets, with, orbits, that, closely, approach, the, sun, cannot, have, been, doing, so, since, the, condensation, of, the, protoplanetary, disc, more, than, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, hence, long, period, comets, could, not, have, formed, in, the, current, orbits, in, which, they, are, always, discovered, and, must, have, been, held, in, an, outer, reservoir, for, nearly, all, of, their, existence, oort, also, studied, tables, of, ephemerides, for, long, period, comets, and, discovered, that, there, is, a, curious, concentration, of, long, period, comets, whose, farthest, retreat, from, the, sun, their, aphelia, cluster, around, 20, 000, au, this, suggested, a, reservoir, at, that, distance, with, a, spherical, isotropic, distribution, he, also, proposed, that, the, relatively, rare, comets, with, orbits, of, about, 10, 000, au, probably, went, through, one, or, more, orbits, into, the, inner, solar, system, and, there, had, their, orbits, drawn, inward, by, the, gravity, of, the, planets, the, oort, cloud, is, thought, to, occupy, a, vast, space, somewhere, between, 2, 000, and, 5, 000, au, 0, 03, and, 0, 08, ly, from, the, sun, to, as, far, out, as, 50, 000, au, 0, 79, ly, or, even, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, au, 1, 58, to, 3, 16, ly, the, region, can, be, subdivided, into, a, spherical, outer, oort, cloud, with, a, radius, of, some, 20, 000, 50, 000, au, 0, 32, 0, 79, ly, and, a, torus, shaped, inner, oort, cloud, with, a, radius, of, 2, 000, 20, 000, au, 0, 03, 0, 32, ly, the, inner, oort, cloud, is, sometimes, known, as, the, hills, cloud, named, for, jack, g, hills, who, proposed, its, existence, in, 1981, models, predict, the, inner, cloud, to, be, the, much, denser, of, the, two, having, tens, or, hundreds, of, times, as, many, cometary, nuclei, as, the, outer, cloud, the, hills, cloud, is, thought, to, be, necessary, to, explain, the, continued, existence, of, the, oort, cloud, after, billions, of, years, because, it, lies, at, the, interface, between, the, dominion, of, solar, and, galactic, gravitation, the, objects, comprising, the, outer, oort, cloud, are, only, weakly, bound, to, the, sun, this, in, turn, allows, small, perturbations, from, nearby, stars, or, the, milky, way, itself, to, inject, long, period, and, possibly, halley, type, comets, inside, the, orbit, of, neptune, this, process, ought, to, have, depleted, the, sparser, outer, cloud, and, yet, long, period, comets, with, orbits, well, above, or, below, the, ecliptic, continue, to, be, observed, the, hills, cloud, is, thought, to, be, a, secondary, reservoir, of, cometary, nuclei, and, the, source, of, replenishment, for, the, tenuous, outer, cloud, as, the, latter, s, numbers, are, gradually, depleted, through, losses, to, the, inner, solar, system, the, outer, oort, cloud, may, have, trillions, of, objects, larger, than, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, and, billions, with, diameters, of, 20, kilometre, 12, mi, this, corresponds, to, an, absolute, magnitude, of, more, than, 11, on, this, analysis, neighboring, objects, in, the, outer, cloud, are, separated, by, a, significant, fraction, of, 1, au, tens, of, millions, of, kilometres, the, outer, cloud, s, total, mass, is, not, known, but, assuming, that, halley, s, comet, is, a, suitable, proxy, for, the, nuclei, composing, the, outer, oort, cloud, their, combined, mass, would, be, roughly, 3, 10, 25, kilograms, 6, 6, 10, 25, lb, or, five, earth, masses, formerly, the, outer, cloud, was, thought, to, be, more, massive, by, two, orders, of, magnitude, containing, up, to, 380, earth, masses, but, improved, knowledge, of, the, size, distribution, of, long, period, comets, has, led, to, lower, estimates, no, estimates, of, the, mass, of, the, inner, oort, cloud, have, been, published, as, of, 2023, if, analyses, of, comets, are, representative, of, the, whole, the, vast, majority, of, oort, cloud, objects, consist, of, ices, such, as, water, methane, ethane, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, cyanide, however, the, discovery, of, the, object, 1996, pw, an, object, whose, appearance, was, consistent, with, a, d, type, asteroid, in, an, orbit, typical, of, a, long, period, comet, prompted, theoretical, research, that, suggests, that, the, oort, cloud, population, consists, of, roughly, one, to, two, percent, asteroids, analysis, of, the, carbon, and, nitrogen, isotope, ratios, in, both, the, long, period, and, jupiter, family, comets, shows, little, difference, between, the, two, despite, their, presumably, vastly, separate, regions, of, origin, this, suggests, that, both, originated, from, the, original, protosolar, cloud, a, conclusion, also, supported, by, studies, of, granular, size, in, oort, cloud, comets, and, by, the, recent, impact, study, of, jupiter, family, comet, tempel, 1, the, oort, cloud, is, thought, to, have, developed, after, the, formation, of, planets, from, the, primordial, protoplanetary, disc, approximately, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, the, most, widely, accepted, hypothesis, is, that, the, oort, cloud, s, objects, initially, coalesced, much, closer, to, the, sun, as, part, of, the, same, process, that, formed, the, planets, and, minor, planets, after, formation, strong, gravitational, interactions, with, young, gas, giants, such, as, jupiter, scattered, the, objects, into, extremely, wide, elliptical, or, parabolic, orbits, that, were, subsequently, modified, by, perturbations, from, passing, stars, and, giant, molecular, clouds, into, long, lived, orbits, detached, from, the, gas, giant, region, recent, research, has, been, cited, by, nasa, hypothesizing, that, a, large, number, of, oort, cloud, objects, are, the, product, of, an, exchange, of, materials, between, the, sun, and, its, sibling, stars, as, they, formed, and, drifted, apart, and, it, is, suggested, that, many, possibly, the, majority, of, oort, cloud, objects, did, not, form, in, close, proximity, to, the, sun, simulations, of, the, evolution, of, the, oort, cloud, from, the, beginnings, of, the, solar, system, to, the, present, suggest, that, the, cloud, s, mass, peaked, around, 800, million, years, after, formation, as, the, pace, of, accretion, and, collision, slowed, and, depletion, began, to, overtake, supply, models, by, julio, ngel, fern, ndez, suggest, that, the, scattered, disc, which, is, the, main, source, for, periodic, comets, in, the, solar, system, might, also, be, the, primary, source, for, oort, cloud, objects, according, to, the, models, about, half, of, the, objects, scattered, travel, outward, toward, the, oort, cloud, whereas, a, quarter, are, shifted, inward, to, jupiter, s, orbit, and, a, quarter, are, ejected, on, hyperbolic, orbits, the, scattered, disc, might, still, be, supplying, the, oort, cloud, with, material, a, third, of, the, scattered, disc, s, population, is, likely, to, end, up, in, the, oort, cloud, after, 2, 5, billion, years, computer, models, suggest, that, collisions, of, cometary, debris, during, the, formation, period, play, a, far, greater, role, than, was, previously, thought, according, to, these, models, the, number, of, collisions, early, in, the, solar, system, s, history, was, so, great, that, most, comets, were, destroyed, before, they, reached, the, oort, cloud, therefore, the, current, cumulative, mass, of, the, oort, cloud, is, far, less, than, was, once, suspected, the, estimated, mass, of, the, cloud, is, only, a, small, part, of, the, 50, 100, earth, masses, of, ejected, material, gravitational, interaction, with, nearby, stars, and, galactic, tides, modified, cometary, orbits, to, make, them, more, circular, this, explains, the, nearly, spherical, shape, of, the, outer, oort, cloud, on, the, other, hand, the, hills, cloud, which, is, bound, more, strongly, to, the, sun, has, not, acquired, a, spherical, shape, recent, studies, have, shown, that, the, formation, of, the, oort, cloud, is, broadly, compatible, with, the, hypothesis, that, the, solar, system, formed, as, part, of, an, embedded, cluster, of, 200, 400, stars, these, early, stars, likely, played, a, role, in, the, cloud, s, formation, since, the, number, of, close, stellar, passages, within, the, cluster, was, much, higher, than, today, leading, to, far, more, frequent, perturbations, in, june, 2010, harold, f, levison, and, others, suggested, on, the, basis, of, enhanced, computer, simulations, that, the, sun, captured, comets, from, other, stars, while, it, was, in, its, birth, cluster, their, results, imply, that, a, substantial, fraction, of, the, oort, cloud, comets, perhaps, exceeding, 90, are, from, the, protoplanetary, discs, of, other, stars, in, july, 2020, amir, siraj, and, avi, loeb, found, that, a, captured, origin, for, the, oort, cloud, in, the, sun, s, birth, cluster, could, address, the, theoretical, tension, in, explaining, the, observed, ratio, of, outer, oort, cloud, to, scattered, disc, objects, and, in, addition, could, increase, the, chances, of, a, captured, planet, nine, comets, are, thought, to, have, two, separate, points, of, origin, in, the, solar, system, short, period, comets, those, with, orbits, of, up, to, 200, years, are, generally, accepted, to, have, emerged, from, either, the, kuiper, belt, or, the, scattered, disc, which, are, two, linked, flat, discs, of, icy, debris, beyond, neptune, s, orbit, at, 30, au, and, jointly, extending, out, beyond, 100, au, very, long, period, comets, such, as, c, 1999, f1, catalina, whose, orbits, last, for, millions, of, years, are, thought, to, originate, directly, from, the, outer, oort, cloud, other, comets, modeled, to, have, come, directly, from, the, outer, oort, cloud, include, c, 2006, p1, mcnaught, c, 2010, x1, elenin, comet, ison, c, 2013, a1, siding, spring, c, 2017, k2, and, c, 2017, t2, panstarrs, the, orbits, within, the, kuiper, belt, are, relatively, stable, and, so, very, few, comets, are, thought, to, originate, there, the, scattered, disc, however, is, dynamically, active, and, is, far, more, likely, to, be, the, place, of, origin, for, comets, comets, pass, from, the, scattered, disc, into, the, realm, of, the, outer, planets, becoming, what, are, known, as, centaurs, these, centaurs, are, then, sent, farther, inward, to, become, the, short, period, comets, there, are, two, main, varieties, of, short, period, comets, jupiter, family, comets, those, with, semi, major, axes, of, less, than, 5, au, and, halley, family, comets, halley, family, comets, named, for, their, prototype, halley, s, comet, are, unusual, in, that, although, they, are, short, period, comets, it, is, hypothesized, that, their, ultimate, origin, lies, in, the, oort, cloud, not, in, the, scattered, disc, based, on, their, orbits, it, is, suggested, they, were, long, period, comets, that, were, captured, by, the, gravity, of, the, giant, planets, and, sent, into, the, inner, solar, system, this, process, may, have, also, created, the, present, orbits, of, a, significant, fraction, of, the, jupiter, family, comets, although, the, majority, of, such, comets, are, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, scattered, disc, oort, noted, that, the, number, of, returning, comets, was, far, less, than, his, model, predicted, and, this, issue, known, as, cometary, fading, has, yet, to, be, resolved, no, dynamical, process, is, known, to, explain, the, smaller, number, of, observed, comets, than, oort, estimated, hypotheses, for, this, discrepancy, include, the, destruction, of, comets, due, to, tidal, stresses, impact, or, heating, the, loss, of, all, volatiles, rendering, some, comets, invisible, or, the, formation, of, a, non, volatile, crust, on, the, surface, dynamical, studies, of, hypothetical, oort, cloud, comets, have, estimated, that, their, occurrence, in, the, outer, planet, region, would, be, several, times, higher, than, in, the, inner, planet, region, this, discrepancy, may, be, due, to, the, gravitational, attraction, of, jupiter, which, acts, as, a, kind, of, barrier, trapping, incoming, comets, and, causing, them, to, collide, with, it, just, as, it, did, with, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, in, 1994, an, example, of, a, typical, dynamically, old, comet, with, an, origin, in, the, oort, cloud, could, be, c, 2018, f4, most, of, the, comets, seen, close, to, the, sun, seem, to, have, reached, their, current, positions, through, gravitational, perturbation, of, the, oort, cloud, by, the, tidal, force, exerted, by, the, milky, way, just, as, the, moon, s, tidal, force, deforms, earth, s, oceans, causing, the, tides, to, rise, and, fall, the, galactic, tide, also, distorts, the, orbits, of, bodies, in, the, outer, solar, system, in, the, charted, regions, of, the, solar, system, these, effects, are, negligible, compared, to, the, gravity, of, the, sun, but, in, the, outer, reaches, of, the, system, the, sun, s, gravity, is, weaker, and, the, gradient, of, the, milky, way, s, gravitational, galactic, center, compresses, it, along, the, other, two, axes, these, small, perturbations, can, shift, orbits, in, the, oort, cloud, to, bring, objects, close, to, the, sun, the, point, at, which, the, sun, s, gravity, concedes, its, influence, to, the, galactic, tide, is, called, the, tidal, truncation, radius, it, lies, at, a, radius, of, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, au, and, marks, the, outer, boundary, of, the, oort, cloud, some, scholars, theorize, that, the, galactic, tide, may, have, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, oort, cloud, by, increasing, the, perihelia, smallest, distances, to, the, sun, of, planetesimals, with, large, aphelia, largest, distances, to, the, sun, the, effects, of, the, galactic, tide, are, quite, complex, and, depend, heavily, on, the, behaviour, of, individual, objects, within, a, planetary, system, cumulatively, however, the, effect, can, be, quite, significant, up, to, 90, of, all, comets, originating, from, the, oort, cloud, may, be, the, result, of, the, galactic, tide, statistical, models, of, the, observed, orbits, of, long, period, comets, argue, that, the, galactic, tide, is, the, principal, means, by, which, their, orbits, are, perturbed, toward, the, inner, solar, system, besides, the, galactic, tide, the, main, trigger, for, sending, comets, into, the, inner, solar, system, is, thought, to, be, interaction, between, the, sun, s, oort, cloud, and, the, gravitational, fields, of, nearby, stars, or, giant, molecular, clouds, the, orbit, of, the, sun, through, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, sometimes, brings, it, in, relatively, close, proximity, to, other, stellar, systems, for, example, it, is, hypothesized, that, 70, 000, years, ago, scholz, s, star, passed, through, the, outer, oort, cloud, although, its, low, mass, and, high, relative, velocity, limited, its, effect, during, the, next, 10, million, years, the, known, star, with, the, greatest, possibility, of, perturbing, the, oort, cloud, is, gliese, 710, this, process, could, also, scatter, oort, cloud, objects, out, of, the, ecliptic, plane, potentially, also, explaining, its, spherical, distribution, in, 1984, physicist, richard, a, muller, postulated, that, the, sun, has, an, as, yet, undetected, companion, either, a, brown, dwarf, or, a, red, dwarf, in, an, elliptical, orbit, within, the, oort, cloud, this, object, known, as, nemesis, was, hypothesized, to, pass, through, a, portion, of, the, oort, cloud, approximately, every, 26, million, years, bombarding, the, inner, solar, system, with, comets, however, to, date, no, evidence, of, nemesis, has, been, found, and, many, lines, of, evidence, such, as, crater, counts, have, thrown, its, existence, into, doubt, recent, scientific, analysis, no, longer, supports, the, idea, that, extinctions, on, earth, happen, at, regular, repeating, intervals, thus, the, nemesis, hypothesis, is, no, longer, needed, to, explain, current, assumptions, a, somewhat, similar, hypothesis, was, advanced, by, astronomer, john, j, matese, of, the, university, of, louisiana, at, lafayette, in, 2002, he, contends, that, more, comets, are, arriving, in, the, inner, solar, system, from, a, particular, region, of, the, postulated, oort, cloud, than, can, be, explained, by, the, galactic, tide, or, stellar, perturbations, alone, and, that, the, most, likely, cause, would, be, a, jupiter, mass, object, in, a, distant, orbit, this, hypothetical, gas, giant, was, nicknamed, tyche, the, wise, mission, an, all, sky, survey, using, parallax, measurements, in, order, to, clarify, local, star, distances, was, capable, of, proving, or, disproving, the, tyche, hypothesis, in, 2014, nasa, announced, that, the, wise, survey, had, ruled, out, any, object, as, they, had, defined, it, space, probes, have, yet, to, reach, the, area, of, the, oort, cloud, voyager, 1, the, once, fastest, and, farthest, of, the, interplanetary, space, probes, currently, leaving, the, solar, system, will, reach, the, oort, cloud, in, about, 300, years, and, would, take, about, 30, 000, years, to, pass, through, it, however, around, 2025, the, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, on, voyager, 1, will, no, longer, supply, enough, power, to, operate, any, of, its, scientific, instruments, preventing, any, further, exploration, by, voyager, 1, the, other, four, probes, currently, escaping, the, solar, system, have, either, already, stopped, functioning, or, are, predicted, to, stop, functioning, before, they, reach, the, oort, cloud, in, the, 1980s, there, was, a, concept, for, a, probe, that, could, reach, 1, 000, au, in, 50, years, called, tau, among, its, missions, would, be, to, look, for, the, oort, cloud, in, the, 2014, announcement, of, opportunity, for, the, discovery, program, an, observatory, to, detect, the, objects, in, the, oort, cloud, and, kuiper, belt, called, the, whipple, mission, was, proposed, it, would, monitor, distant, stars, with, a, photometer, looking, for, transits, up, to, 10, 000, au, away, the, observatory, was, proposed, for, halo, orbiting, around, l2, with, a, suggested, 5, year, mission, it, was, also, suggested, that, the, kepler, space, telescope, could, have, been, capable, of, detecting, objects, in, the, oort, cloud, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow, may, be, read, as, within, or, part, of
