phosphoric, acid, orthophosphoric, acid, monophosphoric, acid, or, phosphoric, v, acid, is, a, colorless, odorless, phosphorus, containing, solid, and, inorganic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, h, 3, p, o, 4, it, is, commonly, encountered, as, an, 85, aqueous, solution, which, is, a, colourless, odourless, and, non, volatile, syrupy, liquid, it, is, a, major, industrial, chemical, being, a, component, of, many, fertilizers, the, compound, is, an, acid, removal, of, all, three, h, ions, gives, the, phosphate, ion, po, 3, 4, removal, of, one, or, two, protons, gives, dihydrogen, phosphate, ion, h, 2, po, 4, and, the, hydrogen, phosphate, ion, hpo, 2, 4, respectively, phosphoric, acid, forms, esters, called, organophosphates, the, name, orthophosphoric, acid, can, be, used, to, distinguish, this, specific, acid, from, other, phosphoric, acids, such, as, pyrophosphoric, acid, nevertheless, the, term, phosphoric, acid, often, means, this, specific, compound, and, that, is, the, current, iupac, nomenclature, phosphoric, acid, is, produced, industrially, by, one, of, two, routes, wet, processes, and, dry, in, the, wet, process, a, phosphate, containing, mineral, such, as, calcium, hydroxyapatite, and, fluorapatite, are, treated, with, sulfuric, acid, calcium, sulfate, gypsum, caso, 4, is, a, by, product, which, is, removed, as, phosphogypsum, the, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, gas, is, streamed, into, a, wet, water, scrubber, producing, hydrofluoric, acid, in, both, cases, the, phosphoric, acid, solution, usually, contains, 23, 33, p, 2, o, 5, 32, 46, h, 3, po, 4, it, may, be, concentrated, to, produce, commercial, or, merchant, grade, phosphoric, acid, which, contains, about, 54, 62, p, 2, o, 5, 75, 85, h, 3, po, 4, further, removal, of, water, yields, superphosphoric, acid, with, a, p, 2, o, 5, concentration, above, 70, corresponding, to, nearly, 100, h, 3, po, 4, the, phosphoric, acid, from, both, processes, may, be, further, purified, by, removing, compounds, of, arsenic, and, other, potentially, toxic, impurities, to, produce, food, grade, phosphoric, acid, phosphate, ore, is, first, reduced, with, coke, in, an, electric, arc, furnace, to, give, elemental, phosphorus, this, process, is, also, known, as, the, thermal, process, or, the, electric, furnace, process, silica, is, also, added, resulting, in, the, production, of, calcium, silicate, slag, elemental, phosphorus, is, distilled, out, of, the, furnace, and, burned, with, air, to, produce, high, purity, phosphorus, pentoxide, which, is, dissolved, in, water, to, make, phosphoric, acid, the, thermal, process, produces, phosphoric, acid, with, a, very, high, concentration, of, p, 2, o, 5, about, 85, and, a, low, level, of, impurities, however, this, process, is, more, expensive, and, energy, intensive, than, the, wet, process, which, produces, phosphoric, acid, with, a, lower, concentration, of, p2o5, about, 26, 52, and, a, higher, level, of, impurities, the, wet, process, is, the, most, common, method, of, producing, phosphoric, acid, for, fertilizer, use, phosphoric, acids, produced, from, phosphate, rock, or, thermal, processes, often, requires, purification, a, common, purification, methods, is, liquid, liquid, extraction, which, involves, the, separation, of, phosphoric, acids, from, water, and, other, impurities, using, organic, solvents, such, as, tributyl, phosphate, tbp, methyl, isobutyl, ketone, mibk, or, n, octanol, nanofiltration, involves, the, use, of, a, premodified, nanofiltration, membrane, which, is, functionalized, by, a, deposit, of, a, high, molecular, weight, polycationic, polymer, of, polyethyleneimines, nanofiltration, has, been, shown, to, significantly, reduce, the, concentrations, of, various, impurities, including, cadmium, aluminum, iron, and, rare, earth, elements, the, laboratory, and, industrial, pilot, scale, results, showed, that, this, process, allows, the, production, of, food, grade, phosphoric, acid, fractional, crystallization, can, achieve, highest, purities, typically, used, for, semiconductor, applications, usually, a, static, crystallizer, is, used, a, static, crystallizer, uses, vertical, plates, which, are, suspended, in, the, molten, feed, and, which, are, alternatingly, cooled, and, heated, by, a, heat, transfer, medium, the, process, begins, with, the, slow, cooling, of, the, heat, transfer, medium, below, the, freezing, point, of, the, stagnant, melt, this, cooling, causes, a, layer, of, crystals, to, grow, on, the, plates, impurities, are, rejected, from, the, growing, crystals, and, are, concentrated, in, the, remaining, melt, after, the, desired, fraction, has, been, crystallized, the, remaining, melt, is, drained, from, the, crystallizer, the, purer, crystalline, layer, remains, adhered, to, the, plates, in, a, subsequent, step, the, plates, are, heated, again, to, liquify, the, crystals, and, the, purified, phosphoric, acid, drained, into, the, product, vessel, the, crystallizer, is, filled, with, feed, again, and, the, next, cooling, cycle, is, started, in, aqueous, solution, phosphoric, acid, behaves, as, a, triprotic, acid, the, difference, between, successive, p, k, a, values, is, sufficiently, large, so, that, salts, of, either, monohydrogen, phosphate, hpo, 2, 4, or, dihydrogen, phosphate, h, 2, po, 4, can, be, prepared, from, a, solution, of, phosphoric, acid, by, adjusting, the, ph, to, be, mid, way, between, the, respective, p, k, a, values, aqueous, solutions, up, to, 62, 5, h, 3, po, 4, are, eutectic, exhibiting, freezing, point, depression, as, low, as, 85, c, when, the, concentration, of, acid, rises, above, 62, 5, the, freezing, point, increases, reaching, 21, c, by, 85, h, 3, po, 4, w, w, the, monohydrate, beyond, this, the, phase, diagram, becomes, complicated, with, significant, local, maxima, and, minima, for, this, reason, phosphoric, acid, is, rarely, sold, above, 85, as, beyond, this, adding, or, removing, small, amounts, moisture, risks, the, entire, mass, freezing, solid, which, would, be, a, major, problem, on, a, large, scale, a, local, maximum, at, 91, 6, which, corresponds, to, the, hemihydrate, 2h, 3, po, 4, h, 2, o, freezing, at, 29, 32, c, there, is, a, second, smaller, eutectic, depression, at, a, concentration, of, 94, 75, with, a, freezing, point, of, 23, 5, c, at, higher, concentrations, the, freezing, point, rapidly, increases, concentrated, phosphoric, acid, tends, to, supercool, before, crystallization, occurs, and, may, be, relatively, resistant, to, crystallisation, even, when, stored, below, the, freezing, point, phosphoric, acid, is, commercially, available, as, aqueous, solutions, of, various, concentrations, not, usually, exceeding, 85, if, concentrated, further, it, undergoes, slow, self, condensation, forming, an, equilibrium, with, pyrophosphoric, acid, even, at, 90, concentration, the, amount, of, pyrophosphoric, acid, present, is, negligible, but, beyond, 95, it, starts, to, increase, reaching, 15, at, what, would, have, otherwise, been, 100, orthophosphoric, acid, as, the, concentration, is, increased, higher, acids, are, formed, culminating, in, the, formation, of, polyphosphoric, acids, it, is, not, possible, to, fully, dehydrate, phosphoric, acid, to, phosphorus, pentoxide, instead, the, polyphosphoric, acid, becomes, increasingly, polymeric, and, viscous, due, to, the, self, condensation, pure, orthophosphoric, acid, can, only, be, obtained, by, a, careful, fractional, freezing, melting, process, the, dominant, use, of, phosphoric, acid, is, for, fertilizers, consuming, approximately, 90, of, production, food, grade, phosphoric, acid, additive, e338, is, used, to, acidify, foods, and, beverages, such, as, various, colas, and, jams, providing, a, tangy, or, sour, taste, the, phosphoric, acid, also, serves, as, a, preservative, soft, drinks, containing, phosphoric, acid, which, would, include, coca, cola, are, sometimes, called, phosphate, sodas, or, phosphates, phosphoric, acid, in, soft, drinks, has, the, potential, to, cause, dental, erosion, phosphoric, acid, also, has, the, potential, to, contribute, to, the, formation, of, kidney, stones, especially, in, those, who, have, had, kidney, stones, previously, specific, applications, of, phosphoric, acid, include, phosphoric, acid, may, also, be, used, for, chemical, polishing, etching, of, metals, like, aluminium, or, for, passivation, of, steel, products, in, a, process, called, phosphatization, phosphoric, acid, is, not, a, strong, acid, however, at, moderate, concentrations, phosphoric, acid, solutions, are, irritating, to, the, skin, contact, with, concentrated, solutions, can, cause, severe, skin, burns, and, permanent, eye, damage, a, link, has, been, shown, between, long, term, regular, cola, intake, and, osteoporosis, in, later, middle, age, in, women, but, not, men
