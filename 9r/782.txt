a, glacier, us, l, e, r, uk, l, s, i, r, l, e, s, i, r, is, a, persistent, body, of, dense, ice, that, is, constantly, moving, downhill, under, its, own, weight, a, glacier, forms, where, the, accumulation, of, snow, exceeds, its, ablation, over, many, years, often, centuries, it, acquires, distinguishing, features, such, as, crevasses, and, seracs, as, it, slowly, flows, and, deforms, under, stresses, induced, by, its, weight, as, it, moves, it, abrades, rock, and, debris, from, its, substrate, to, create, landforms, such, as, cirques, moraines, or, fjords, although, a, glacier, may, flow, into, a, body, of, water, it, forms, only, on, land, and, is, distinct, from, the, much, thinner, sea, ice, and, lake, ice, that, form, on, the, surface, of, bodies, of, water, on, earth, 99, of, glacial, ice, is, contained, within, vast, ice, sheets, also, known, as, continental, glaciers, in, the, polar, regions, but, glaciers, may, be, found, in, mountain, ranges, on, every, continent, other, than, the, australian, mainland, including, oceania, s, high, latitude, oceanic, island, countries, such, as, new, zealand, between, latitudes, 35, n, and, 35, s, glaciers, occur, only, in, the, himalayas, andes, and, a, few, high, mountains, in, east, africa, mexico, new, guinea, and, on, zard, kuh, in, iran, with, more, than, 7, 000, known, glaciers, pakistan, has, more, glacial, ice, than, any, other, country, outside, the, polar, regions, glaciers, cover, about, 10, of, earth, s, land, surface, continental, glaciers, cover, nearly, 13, million, km, 2, 5, million, sq, mi, or, about, 98, of, antarctica, s, 13, 2, million, km, 2, 5, 1, million, sq, mi, with, an, average, thickness, of, ice, 2, 100, m, 7, 000, ft, greenland, and, patagonia, also, have, huge, expanses, of, continental, glaciers, the, volume, of, glaciers, not, including, the, ice, sheets, of, antarctica, and, greenland, has, been, estimated, at, 170, 000, km, 3, glacial, ice, is, the, largest, reservoir, of, fresh, water, on, earth, holding, with, ice, sheets, about, 69, percent, of, the, world, s, freshwater, many, glaciers, from, temperate, alpine, and, seasonal, polar, climates, store, water, as, ice, during, the, colder, seasons, and, release, it, later, in, the, form, of, meltwater, as, warmer, summer, temperatures, cause, the, glacier, to, melt, creating, a, water, source, that, is, especially, important, for, plants, animals, and, human, uses, when, other, sources, may, be, scant, however, within, high, altitude, and, antarctic, environments, the, seasonal, temperature, difference, is, often, not, sufficient, to, release, meltwater, since, glacial, mass, is, affected, by, long, term, climatic, changes, e, g, precipitation, mean, temperature, and, cloud, cover, glacial, mass, changes, are, considered, among, the, most, sensitive, indicators, of, climate, change, and, are, a, major, source, of, variations, in, sea, level, a, large, piece, of, compressed, ice, or, a, glacier, appears, blue, as, large, quantities, of, water, appear, blue, because, water, molecules, absorb, other, colors, more, efficiently, than, blue, the, other, reason, for, the, blue, color, of, glaciers, is, the, lack, of, air, bubbles, air, bubbles, which, give, a, white, color, to, ice, are, squeezed, out, by, pressure, increasing, the, created, ice, s, density, the, word, glacier, is, a, loanword, from, french, and, goes, back, via, franco, proven, al, to, the, vulgar, latin, glaci, rium, derived, from, the, late, latin, glacia, and, ultimately, latin, glaci, s, meaning, ice, the, processes, and, features, caused, by, or, related, to, glaciers, are, referred, to, as, glacial, the, process, of, glacier, establishment, growth, and, flow, is, called, glaciation, the, corresponding, area, of, study, is, called, glaciology, glaciers, are, important, components, of, the, global, cryosphere, glaciers, are, categorized, by, their, morphology, thermal, characteristics, and, behavior, alpine, glaciers, form, on, the, crests, and, slopes, of, mountains, a, glacier, that, fills, a, valley, is, called, a, valley, glacier, or, alternatively, an, alpine, glacier, or, mountain, glacier, a, large, body, of, glacial, ice, astride, a, mountain, mountain, range, or, volcano, is, termed, an, ice, cap, or, ice, field, ice, caps, have, an, area, less, than, 50, 000, km, 2, 19, 000, sq, mi, by, definition, glacial, bodies, larger, than, 50, 000, km, 2, 19, 000, sq, mi, are, called, ice, sheets, or, continental, glaciers, several, kilometers, deep, they, obscure, the, underlying, topography, only, nunataks, protrude, from, their, surfaces, the, only, extant, ice, sheets, are, the, two, that, cover, most, of, antarctica, and, greenland, they, contain, vast, quantities, of, freshwater, enough, that, if, both, melted, global, sea, levels, would, rise, by, over, 70, m, 230, ft, portions, of, an, ice, sheet, or, cap, that, extend, into, water, are, called, ice, shelves, they, tend, to, be, thin, with, limited, slopes, and, reduced, velocities, narrow, fast, moving, sections, of, an, ice, sheet, are, called, ice, streams, in, antarctica, many, ice, streams, drain, into, large, ice, shelves, some, drain, directly, into, the, sea, often, with, an, ice, tongue, like, mertz, glacier, tidewater, glaciers, are, glaciers, that, terminate, in, the, sea, including, most, glaciers, flowing, from, greenland, antarctica, baffin, devon, and, ellesmere, islands, in, canada, southeast, alaska, and, the, northern, and, southern, patagonian, ice, fields, as, the, ice, reaches, the, sea, pieces, break, off, or, calve, forming, icebergs, most, tidewater, glaciers, calve, above, sea, level, which, often, results, in, a, tremendous, impact, as, the, iceberg, strikes, the, water, tidewater, glaciers, undergo, centuries, long, cycles, of, advance, and, retreat, that, are, much, less, affected, by, climate, change, than, other, glaciers, thermally, a, temperate, glacier, is, at, a, melting, point, throughout, the, year, from, its, surface, to, its, base, the, ice, of, a, polar, glacier, is, always, below, the, freezing, threshold, from, the, surface, to, its, base, although, the, surface, snowpack, may, experience, seasonal, melting, a, subpolar, glacier, includes, both, temperate, and, polar, ice, depending, on, the, depth, beneath, the, surface, and, position, along, the, length, of, the, glacier, in, a, similar, way, the, thermal, regime, of, a, glacier, is, often, described, by, its, basal, temperature, a, cold, based, glacier, is, below, freezing, at, the, ice, ground, interface, and, is, thus, frozen, to, the, underlying, substrate, a, warm, based, glacier, is, above, or, at, freezing, at, the, interface, and, is, able, to, slide, at, this, contact, this, contrast, is, thought, to, a, large, extent, to, govern, the, ability, of, a, glacier, to, effectively, erode, its, bed, as, sliding, ice, promotes, plucking, at, rock, from, the, surface, below, glaciers, which, are, partly, cold, based, and, partly, warm, based, are, known, as, polythermal, glaciers, form, where, the, accumulation, of, snow, and, ice, exceeds, ablation, a, glacier, usually, originates, from, a, cirque, landform, alternatively, known, as, a, corrie, or, as, a, cwm, a, typically, armchair, shaped, geological, feature, such, as, a, depression, between, mountains, enclosed, by, ar, tes, which, collects, and, compresses, through, gravity, the, snow, that, falls, into, it, this, snow, accumulates, and, the, weight, of, the, snow, falling, above, compacts, it, forming, n, v, granular, snow, further, crushing, of, the, individual, snowflakes, and, squeezing, the, air, from, the, snow, turns, it, into, glacial, ice, this, glacial, ice, will, fill, the, cirque, until, it, overflows, through, a, geological, weakness, or, vacancy, such, as, a, gap, between, two, mountains, when, the, mass, of, snow, and, ice, reaches, sufficient, thickness, it, begins, to, move, by, a, combination, of, surface, slope, gravity, and, pressure, on, steeper, slopes, this, can, occur, with, as, little, as, 15, m, 49, ft, of, snow, ice, in, temperate, glaciers, snow, repeatedly, freezes, and, thaws, changing, into, granular, ice, called, firn, under, the, pressure, of, the, layers, of, ice, and, snow, above, it, this, granular, ice, fuses, into, denser, firn, over, a, period, of, years, layers, of, firn, undergo, further, compaction, and, become, glacial, ice, glacier, ice, is, slightly, more, dense, than, ice, formed, from, frozen, water, because, glacier, ice, contains, fewer, trapped, air, bubbles, glacial, ice, has, a, distinctive, blue, tint, because, it, absorbs, some, red, light, due, to, an, overtone, of, the, infrared, oh, stretching, mode, of, the, water, molecule, liquid, water, appears, blue, for, the, same, reason, the, blue, of, glacier, ice, is, sometimes, misattributed, to, rayleigh, scattering, of, bubbles, in, the, ice, a, glacier, originates, at, a, location, called, its, glacier, head, and, terminates, at, its, glacier, foot, snout, or, terminus, glaciers, are, broken, into, zones, based, on, surface, snowpack, and, melt, conditions, the, ablation, zone, is, the, region, where, there, is, a, net, loss, in, glacier, mass, the, upper, part, of, a, glacier, where, accumulation, exceeds, ablation, is, called, the, accumulation, zone, the, equilibrium, line, separates, the, ablation, zone, and, the, accumulation, zone, it, is, the, contour, where, the, amount, of, new, snow, gained, by, accumulation, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, ice, lost, through, ablation, in, general, the, accumulation, zone, accounts, for, 60, 70, of, the, glacier, s, surface, area, more, if, the, glacier, calves, icebergs, ice, in, the, accumulation, zone, is, deep, enough, to, exert, a, downward, force, that, erodes, underlying, rock, after, a, glacier, melts, it, often, leaves, behind, a, bowl, or, amphitheater, shaped, depression, that, ranges, in, size, from, large, basins, like, the, great, lakes, to, smaller, mountain, depressions, known, as, cirques, the, accumulation, zone, can, be, subdivided, based, on, its, melt, conditions, the, health, of, a, glacier, is, usually, assessed, by, determining, the, glacier, mass, balance, or, observing, terminus, behavior, healthy, glaciers, have, large, accumulation, zones, more, than, 60, of, their, area, is, snow, covered, at, the, end, of, the, melt, season, and, they, have, a, terminus, with, a, vigorous, flow, following, the, little, ice, age, s, end, around, 1850, glaciers, around, the, earth, have, retreated, substantially, a, slight, cooling, led, to, the, advance, of, many, alpine, glaciers, between, 1950, and, 1985, but, since, 1985, glacier, retreat, and, mass, loss, has, become, larger, and, increasingly, ubiquitous, glaciers, move, downhill, by, the, force, of, gravity, and, the, internal, deformation, of, ice, at, the, molecular, level, ice, consists, of, stacked, layers, of, molecules, with, relatively, weak, bonds, between, layers, when, the, amount, of, strain, deformation, is, proportional, to, the, stress, being, applied, ice, will, act, as, an, elastic, solid, ice, needs, to, be, at, least, 30, m, 98, ft, thick, to, even, start, flowing, but, once, its, thickness, exceeds, about, 50, m, 160, ft, 160, ft, stress, on, the, layer, above, will, exceeds, the, inter, layer, binding, strength, and, then, it, ll, move, faster, than, the, layer, below, this, means, that, small, amounts, of, stress, can, result, in, a, large, amount, of, strain, causing, the, deformation, to, become, a, plastic, flow, rather, than, elastic, then, the, glacier, will, begin, to, deform, under, its, own, weight, and, flow, across, the, landscape, according, to, the, glen, nye, flow, law, the, relationship, between, stress, and, strain, and, thus, the, rate, of, internal, flow, can, be, modeled, as, follows, where, the, lowest, velocities, are, near, the, base, of, the, glacier, and, along, valley, sides, where, friction, acts, against, flow, causing, the, most, deformation, velocity, increases, inward, toward, the, center, line, and, upward, as, the, amount, of, deformation, decreases, the, highest, flow, velocities, are, found, at, the, surface, representing, the, sum, of, the, velocities, of, all, the, layers, below, because, ice, can, flow, faster, where, it, is, thicker, the, rate, of, glacier, induced, erosion, is, directly, proportional, to, the, thickness, of, overlying, ice, consequently, pre, glacial, low, hollows, will, be, deepened, and, pre, existing, topography, will, be, amplified, by, glacial, action, while, nunataks, which, protrude, above, ice, sheets, barely, erode, at, all, erosion, has, been, estimated, as, 5, m, per, 1, 2, million, years, this, explains, for, example, the, deep, profile, of, fjords, which, can, reach, a, kilometer, in, depth, as, ice, is, topographically, steered, into, them, the, extension, of, fjords, inland, increases, the, rate, of, ice, sheet, thinning, since, they, are, the, principal, conduits, for, draining, ice, sheets, it, also, makes, the, ice, sheets, more, sensitive, to, changes, in, climate, and, the, ocean, although, evidence, in, favor, of, glacial, flow, was, known, by, the, early, 19th, century, other, theories, of, glacial, motion, were, advanced, such, as, the, idea, that, meltwater, refreezing, inside, glaciers, caused, the, glacier, to, dilate, and, extend, its, length, as, it, became, clear, that, glaciers, behaved, to, some, degree, as, if, the, ice, were, a, viscous, fluid, it, was, argued, that, regelation, or, the, melting, and, refreezing, of, ice, at, a, temperature, lowered, by, the, pressure, on, the, ice, inside, the, glacier, was, what, allowed, the, ice, to, deform, and, flow, james, forbes, came, up, with, the, essentially, correct, explanation, in, the, 1840s, although, it, was, several, decades, before, it, was, fully, accepted, the, top, 50, m, 160, ft, of, a, glacier, are, rigid, because, they, are, under, low, pressure, this, upper, section, is, known, as, the, fracture, zone, and, moves, mostly, as, a, single, unit, over, the, plastic, flowing, lower, section, when, a, glacier, moves, through, irregular, terrain, cracks, called, crevasses, develop, in, the, fracture, zone, crevasses, form, because, of, differences, in, glacier, velocity, if, two, rigid, sections, of, a, glacier, move, at, different, speeds, or, directions, shear, forces, cause, them, to, break, apart, opening, a, crevasse, crevasses, are, seldom, more, than, 46, m, 150, ft, deep, but, in, some, cases, can, be, at, least, 300, m, 1, 000, ft, deep, beneath, this, point, the, plasticity, of, the, ice, prevents, the, formation, of, cracks, intersecting, crevasses, can, create, isolated, peaks, in, the, ice, called, seracs, crevasses, can, form, in, several, different, ways, transverse, crevasses, are, transverse, to, flow, and, form, where, steeper, slopes, cause, a, glacier, to, accelerate, longitudinal, crevasses, form, semi, parallel, to, flow, where, a, glacier, expands, laterally, marginal, crevasses, form, near, the, edge, of, the, glacier, caused, by, the, reduction, in, speed, caused, by, friction, of, the, valley, walls, marginal, crevasses, are, largely, transverse, to, flow, moving, glacier, ice, can, sometimes, separate, from, the, stagnant, ice, above, forming, a, bergschrund, bergschrunds, resemble, crevasses, but, are, singular, features, at, a, glacier, s, margins, crevasses, make, travel, over, glaciers, hazardous, especially, when, they, are, hidden, by, fragile, snow, bridges, below, the, equilibrium, line, glacial, meltwater, is, concentrated, in, stream, channels, meltwater, can, pool, in, proglacial, lakes, on, top, of, a, glacier, or, descend, into, the, depths, of, a, glacier, via, moulins, streams, within, or, beneath, a, glacier, flow, in, englacial, or, sub, glacial, tunnels, these, tunnels, sometimes, reemerge, at, the, glacier, s, surface, most, of, the, important, processes, controlling, glacial, motion, occur, in, the, ice, bed, contact, even, though, it, is, only, a, few, meters, thick, the, bed, s, temperature, roughness, and, softness, define, basal, shear, stress, which, in, turn, defines, whether, movement, of, the, glacier, will, be, accommodated, by, motion, in, the, sediments, or, if, it, ll, be, able, to, slide, a, soft, bed, with, high, porosity, and, low, pore, fluid, pressure, allows, the, glacier, to, move, by, sediment, sliding, the, base, of, the, glacier, may, even, remain, frozen, to, the, bed, where, the, underlying, sediment, slips, underneath, it, like, a, tube, of, toothpaste, a, hard, bed, cannot, deform, in, this, way, therefore, the, only, way, for, hard, based, glaciers, to, move, is, by, basal, sliding, where, meltwater, forms, between, the, ice, and, the, bed, itself, whether, a, bed, is, hard, or, soft, depends, on, the, porosity, and, pore, pressure, higher, porosity, decreases, the, sediment, strength, thus, increases, the, shear, stress, b, porosity, may, vary, through, a, range, of, methods, bed, softness, may, vary, in, space, or, time, and, changes, dramatically, from, glacier, to, glacier, an, important, factor, is, the, underlying, geology, glacial, speeds, tend, to, differ, more, when, they, change, bedrock, than, when, the, gradient, changes, further, bed, roughness, can, also, act, to, slow, glacial, motion, the, roughness, of, the, bed, is, a, measure, of, how, many, boulders, and, obstacles, protrude, into, the, overlying, ice, ice, flows, around, these, obstacles, by, melting, under, the, high, pressure, on, their, stoss, side, the, resultant, meltwater, is, then, forced, into, the, cavity, arising, in, their, lee, side, where, it, re, freezes, as, well, as, affecting, the, sediment, stress, fluid, pressure, p, w, can, affect, the, friction, between, the, glacier, and, the, bed, high, fluid, pressure, provides, a, buoyancy, force, upwards, on, the, glacier, reducing, the, friction, at, its, base, the, fluid, pressure, is, compared, to, the, ice, overburden, pressure, p, i, given, by, gh, under, fast, flowing, ice, streams, these, two, pressures, will, be, approximately, equal, with, an, effective, pressure, p, i, p, w, of, 30, kpa, i, e, all, of, the, weight, of, the, ice, is, supported, by, the, underlying, water, and, the, glacier, is, afloat, glaciers, may, also, move, by, basal, sliding, where, the, base, of, the, glacier, is, lubricated, by, the, presence, of, liquid, water, reducing, basal, shear, stress, and, allowing, the, glacier, to, slide, over, the, terrain, on, which, it, sits, meltwater, may, be, produced, by, pressure, induced, melting, friction, or, geothermal, heat, the, more, variable, the, amount, of, melting, at, surface, of, the, glacier, the, faster, the, ice, will, flow, basal, sliding, is, dominant, in, temperate, or, warm, based, glaciers, the, presence, of, basal, meltwater, depends, on, both, bed, temperature, and, other, factors, for, instance, the, melting, point, of, water, decreases, under, pressure, meaning, that, water, melts, at, a, lower, temperature, under, thicker, glaciers, this, acts, as, a, double, whammy, because, thicker, glaciers, have, a, lower, heat, conductance, meaning, that, the, basal, temperature, is, also, likely, to, be, higher, bed, temperature, tends, to, vary, in, a, cyclic, fashion, a, cool, bed, has, a, high, strength, reducing, the, speed, of, the, glacier, this, increases, the, rate, of, accumulation, since, newly, fallen, snow, is, not, transported, away, consequently, the, glacier, thickens, with, three, consequences, firstly, the, bed, is, better, insulated, allowing, greater, retention, of, geothermal, heat, secondly, the, increased, pressure, can, facilitate, melting, most, importantly, d, is, increased, these, factors, will, combine, to, accelerate, the, glacier, as, friction, increases, with, the, square, of, velocity, faster, motion, will, greatly, increase, frictional, heating, with, ensuing, melting, which, causes, a, positive, feedback, increasing, ice, speed, to, a, faster, flow, rate, still, west, antarctic, glaciers, are, known, to, reach, velocities, of, up, to, a, kilometre, per, year, eventually, the, ice, will, be, surging, fast, enough, that, it, begins, to, thin, as, accumulation, cannot, keep, up, with, the, transport, this, thinning, will, increase, the, conductive, heat, loss, slowing, the, glacier, and, causing, freezing, this, freezing, will, slow, the, glacier, further, often, until, it, is, stationary, whence, the, cycle, can, begin, again, the, flow, of, water, under, the, glacial, surface, can, have, a, large, effect, on, the, motion, of, the, glacier, itself, subglacial, lakes, contain, significant, amounts, of, water, which, can, move, fast, cubic, kilometres, can, be, transported, between, lakes, over, the, course, of, a, couple, of, years, this, motion, is, thought, to, occur, in, two, main, modes, pipe, flow, involves, liquid, water, moving, through, pipe, like, conduits, like, a, sub, glacial, river, sheet, flow, involves, motion, of, water, in, a, thin, layer, a, switch, between, the, two, flow, conditions, may, be, associated, with, surging, behaviour, indeed, the, loss, of, sub, glacial, water, supply, has, been, linked, with, the, shut, down, of, ice, movement, in, the, kamb, ice, stream, the, subglacial, motion, of, water, is, expressed, in, the, surface, topography, of, ice, sheets, which, slump, down, into, vacated, subglacial, lakes, the, speed, of, glacial, displacement, is, partly, determined, by, friction, friction, makes, the, ice, at, the, bottom, of, the, glacier, move, more, slowly, than, ice, at, the, top, in, alpine, glaciers, friction, is, also, generated, at, the, valley, s, sidewalls, which, slows, the, edges, relative, to, the, center, mean, glacial, speed, varies, greatly, but, is, typically, around, 1, m, 3, ft, per, day, there, may, be, no, motion, in, stagnant, areas, for, example, in, parts, of, alaska, trees, can, establish, themselves, on, surface, sediment, deposits, in, other, cases, glaciers, can, move, as, fast, as, 20, 30, m, 70, 100, ft, per, day, such, as, in, greenland, s, jakobshavn, isbr, glacial, speed, is, affected, by, factors, such, as, slope, ice, thickness, snowfall, longitudinal, confinement, basal, temperature, meltwater, production, and, bed, hardness, a, few, glaciers, have, periods, of, very, rapid, advancement, called, surges, these, glaciers, exhibit, normal, movement, until, suddenly, they, accelerate, then, return, to, their, previous, movement, state, these, surges, may, be, caused, by, the, failure, of, the, underlying, bedrock, the, pooling, of, meltwater, at, the, base, of, the, glacier, perhaps, delivered, from, a, supraglacial, lake, or, the, simple, accumulation, of, mass, beyond, a, critical, tipping, point, temporary, rates, up, to, 90, m, 300, ft, per, day, have, occurred, when, increased, temperature, or, overlying, pressure, caused, bottom, ice, to, melt, and, water, to, accumulate, beneath, a, glacier, in, glaciated, areas, where, the, glacier, moves, faster, than, one, km, per, year, glacial, earthquakes, occur, these, are, large, scale, earthquakes, that, have, seismic, magnitudes, as, high, as, 6, 1, the, number, of, glacial, earthquakes, in, greenland, peaks, every, year, in, july, august, and, september, and, increased, rapidly, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, in, a, study, using, data, from, january, 1993, through, october, 2005, more, events, were, detected, every, year, since, 2002, and, twice, as, many, events, were, recorded, in, 2005, as, there, were, in, any, other, year, ogives, or, forbes, bands, are, alternating, wave, crests, and, valleys, that, appear, as, dark, and, light, bands, of, ice, on, glacier, surfaces, they, are, linked, to, seasonal, motion, of, glaciers, the, width, of, one, dark, and, one, light, band, generally, equals, the, annual, movement, of, the, glacier, ogives, are, formed, when, ice, from, an, icefall, is, severely, broken, up, increasing, ablation, surface, area, during, summer, this, creates, a, swale, and, space, for, snow, accumulation, in, the, winter, which, in, turn, creates, a, ridge, sometimes, ogives, consist, only, of, undulations, or, color, bands, and, are, described, as, wave, ogives, or, band, ogives, glaciers, are, present, on, every, continent, and, in, approximately, fifty, countries, excluding, those, australia, south, africa, that, have, glaciers, only, on, distant, subantarctic, island, territories, extensive, glaciers, are, found, in, antarctica, argentina, chile, canada, pakistan, alaska, greenland, and, iceland, mountain, glaciers, are, widespread, especially, in, the, andes, the, himalayas, the, rocky, mountains, the, caucasus, scandinavian, mountains, and, the, alps, snezhnika, glacier, in, pirin, mountain, bulgaria, with, a, latitude, of, 41, 46, 09, n, is, the, southernmost, glacial, mass, in, europe, mainland, australia, currently, contains, no, glaciers, although, a, small, glacier, on, mount, kosciuszko, was, present, in, the, last, glacial, period, in, new, guinea, small, rapidly, diminishing, glaciers, are, located, on, puncak, jaya, africa, has, glaciers, on, mount, kilimanjaro, in, tanzania, on, mount, kenya, and, in, the, rwenzori, mountains, oceanic, islands, with, glaciers, include, iceland, several, of, the, islands, off, the, coast, of, norway, including, svalbard, and, jan, mayen, to, the, far, north, new, zealand, and, the, subantarctic, islands, of, marion, heard, grande, terre, kerguelen, and, bouvet, during, glacial, periods, of, the, quaternary, taiwan, hawaii, on, mauna, kea, and, tenerife, also, had, large, alpine, glaciers, while, the, faroe, and, crozet, islands, were, completely, glaciated, the, permanent, snow, cover, necessary, for, glacier, formation, is, affected, by, factors, such, as, the, degree, of, slope, on, the, land, amount, of, snowfall, and, the, winds, glaciers, can, be, found, in, all, latitudes, except, from, 20, to, 27, north, and, south, of, the, equator, where, the, presence, of, the, descending, limb, of, the, hadley, circulation, lowers, precipitation, so, much, that, with, high, insolation, snow, lines, reach, above, 6, 500, m, 21, 330, ft, between, 19, n, and, 19, s, however, precipitation, is, higher, and, the, mountains, above, 5, 000, m, 16, 400, ft, usually, have, permanent, snow, even, at, high, latitudes, glacier, formation, is, not, inevitable, areas, of, the, arctic, such, as, banks, island, and, the, mcmurdo, dry, valleys, in, antarctica, are, considered, polar, deserts, where, glaciers, cannot, form, because, they, receive, little, snowfall, despite, the, bitter, cold, cold, air, unlike, warm, air, is, unable, to, transport, much, water, vapor, even, during, glacial, periods, of, the, quaternary, manchuria, lowland, siberia, and, central, and, northern, alaska, though, extraordinarily, cold, had, such, light, snowfall, that, glaciers, could, not, form, in, addition, to, the, dry, unglaciated, polar, regions, some, mountains, and, volcanoes, in, bolivia, chile, and, argentina, are, high, 4, 500, to, 6, 900, m, or, 14, 800, to, 22, 600, ft, and, cold, but, the, relative, lack, of, precipitation, prevents, snow, from, accumulating, into, glaciers, this, is, because, these, peaks, are, located, near, or, in, the, hyperarid, atacama, desert, glaciers, erode, terrain, through, two, principal, processes, plucking, and, abrasion, as, glaciers, flow, over, bedrock, they, soften, and, lift, blocks, of, rock, into, the, ice, this, process, called, plucking, is, caused, by, subglacial, water, that, penetrates, fractures, in, the, bedrock, and, subsequently, freezes, and, expands, this, expansion, causes, the, ice, to, act, as, a, lever, that, loosens, the, rock, by, lifting, it, thus, sediments, of, all, sizes, become, part, of, the, glacier, s, load, if, a, retreating, glacier, gains, enough, debris, it, may, become, a, rock, glacier, like, the, timpanogos, glacier, in, utah, abrasion, occurs, when, the, ice, and, its, load, of, rock, fragments, slide, over, bedrock, and, function, as, sandpaper, smoothing, and, polishing, the, bedrock, below, the, pulverized, rock, this, process, produces, is, called, rock, flour, and, is, made, up, of, rock, grains, between, 0, 002, and, 0, 00625, mm, in, size, abrasion, leads, to, steeper, valley, walls, and, mountain, slopes, in, alpine, settings, which, can, cause, avalanches, and, rock, slides, which, add, even, more, material, to, the, glacier, glacial, abrasion, is, commonly, characterized, by, glacial, striations, glaciers, produce, these, when, they, contain, large, boulders, that, carve, long, scratches, in, the, bedrock, by, mapping, the, direction, of, the, striations, researchers, can, determine, the, direction, of, the, glacier, s, movement, similar, to, striations, are, chatter, marks, lines, of, crescent, shape, depressions, in, the, rock, underlying, a, glacier, they, are, formed, by, abrasion, when, boulders, in, the, glacier, are, repeatedly, caught, and, released, as, they, are, dragged, along, the, bedrock, the, rate, of, glacier, erosion, varies, six, factors, control, erosion, rate, when, the, bedrock, has, frequent, fractures, on, the, surface, glacial, erosion, rates, tend, to, increase, as, plucking, is, the, main, erosive, force, on, the, surface, when, the, bedrock, has, wide, gaps, between, sporadic, fractures, however, abrasion, tends, to, be, the, dominant, erosive, form, and, glacial, erosion, rates, become, slow, glaciers, in, lower, latitudes, tend, to, be, much, more, erosive, than, glaciers, in, higher, latitudes, because, they, have, more, meltwater, reaching, the, glacial, base, and, facilitate, sediment, production, and, transport, under, the, same, moving, speed, and, amount, of, ice, material, that, becomes, incorporated, in, a, glacier, is, typically, carried, as, far, as, the, zone, of, ablation, before, being, deposited, glacial, deposits, are, of, two, distinct, types, larger, pieces, of, rock, that, are, encrusted, in, till, or, deposited, on, the, surface, are, called, glacial, erratics, they, range, in, size, from, pebbles, to, boulders, but, as, they, are, often, moved, great, distances, they, may, be, drastically, different, from, the, material, upon, which, they, are, found, patterns, of, glacial, erratics, hint, at, past, glacial, motions, glacial, moraines, are, formed, by, the, deposition, of, material, from, a, glacier, and, are, exposed, after, the, glacier, has, retreated, they, usually, appear, as, linear, mounds, of, till, a, non, sorted, mixture, of, rock, gravel, and, boulders, within, a, matrix, of, fine, powdery, material, terminal, or, end, moraines, are, formed, at, the, foot, or, terminal, end, of, a, glacier, lateral, moraines, are, formed, on, the, sides, of, the, glacier, medial, moraines, are, formed, when, two, different, glaciers, merge, and, the, lateral, moraines, of, each, coalesce, to, form, a, moraine, in, the, middle, of, the, combined, glacier, less, apparent, are, ground, moraines, also, called, glacial, drift, which, often, blankets, the, surface, underneath, the, glacier, downslope, from, the, equilibrium, line, the, term, moraine, is, of, french, origin, it, was, coined, by, peasants, to, describe, alluvial, embankments, and, rims, found, near, the, margins, of, glaciers, in, the, french, alps, in, modern, geology, the, term, is, used, more, broadly, and, is, applied, to, a, series, of, formations, all, of, which, are, composed, of, till, moraines, can, also, create, moraine, dammed, lakes, drumlins, are, asymmetrical, canoe, shaped, hills, made, mainly, of, till, their, heights, vary, from, 15, to, 50, meters, and, they, can, reach, a, kilometer, in, length, the, steepest, side, of, the, hill, faces, the, direction, from, which, the, ice, advanced, stoss, while, a, longer, slope, is, left, in, the, ice, s, direction, of, movement, lee, drumlins, are, found, in, groups, called, drumlin, fields, or, drumlin, camps, one, of, these, fields, is, found, east, of, rochester, new, york, it, is, estimated, to, contain, about, 10, 000, drumlins, although, the, process, that, forms, drumlins, is, not, fully, understood, their, shape, implies, that, they, are, products, of, the, plastic, deformation, zone, of, ancient, glaciers, it, is, believed, that, many, drumlins, were, formed, when, glaciers, advanced, over, and, altered, the, deposits, of, earlier, glaciers, before, glaciation, mountain, valleys, have, a, characteristic, v, shape, produced, by, eroding, water, during, glaciation, these, valleys, are, often, widened, deepened, and, smoothed, to, form, a, u, shaped, glacial, valley, or, glacial, trough, as, it, is, sometimes, called, the, erosion, that, creates, glacial, valleys, truncates, any, spurs, of, rock, or, earth, that, may, have, earlier, extended, across, the, valley, creating, broadly, triangular, shaped, cliffs, called, truncated, spurs, within, glacial, valleys, depressions, created, by, plucking, and, abrasion, can, be, filled, by, lakes, called, paternoster, lakes, if, a, glacial, valley, runs, into, a, large, body, of, water, it, forms, a, fjord, typically, glaciers, deepen, their, valleys, more, than, their, smaller, tributaries, therefore, when, glaciers, recede, the, valleys, of, the, tributary, glaciers, remain, above, the, main, glacier, s, depression, and, are, called, hanging, valleys, at, the, start, of, a, classic, valley, glacier, is, a, bowl, shaped, cirque, which, have, escarped, walls, on, three, sides, but, is, open, on, the, side, that, descends, into, the, valley, cirques, are, where, ice, begins, to, accumulate, in, a, glacier, two, glacial, cirques, may, form, back, to, back, and, erode, their, backwalls, until, only, a, narrow, ridge, called, an, ar, te, is, left, this, structure, may, result, in, a, mountain, pass, if, multiple, cirques, encircle, a, single, mountain, they, create, pointed, pyramidal, peaks, particularly, steep, examples, are, called, horns, passage, of, glacial, ice, over, an, area, of, bedrock, may, cause, the, rock, to, be, sculpted, into, a, knoll, called, a, roche, moutonn, e, or, sheepback, rock, roches, moutonn, es, may, be, elongated, rounded, and, asymmetrical, in, shape, they, range, in, length, from, less, than, a, meter, to, several, hundred, meters, long, roches, moutonn, es, have, a, gentle, slope, on, their, up, glacier, sides, and, a, steep, to, vertical, face, on, their, down, glacier, sides, the, glacier, abrades, the, smooth, slope, on, the, upstream, side, as, it, flows, along, but, tears, rock, fragments, loose, and, carries, them, away, from, the, downstream, side, via, plucking, as, the, water, that, rises, from, the, ablation, zone, moves, away, from, the, glacier, it, carries, fine, eroded, sediments, with, it, as, the, speed, of, the, water, decreases, so, does, its, capacity, to, carry, objects, in, suspension, the, water, thus, gradually, deposits, the, sediment, as, it, runs, creating, an, alluvial, plain, when, this, phenomenon, occurs, in, a, valley, it, is, called, a, valley, train, when, the, deposition, is, in, an, estuary, the, sediments, are, known, as, bay, mud, outwash, plains, and, valley, trains, are, usually, accompanied, by, basins, known, as, kettles, these, are, small, lakes, formed, when, large, ice, blocks, that, are, trapped, in, alluvium, melt, and, produce, water, filled, depressions, kettle, diameters, range, from, 5, m, to, 13, km, with, depths, of, up, to, 45, meters, most, are, circular, in, shape, because, the, blocks, of, ice, that, formed, them, were, rounded, as, they, melted, when, a, glacier, s, size, shrinks, below, a, critical, point, its, flow, stops, and, it, becomes, stationary, meanwhile, meltwater, within, and, beneath, the, ice, leaves, stratified, alluvial, deposits, these, deposits, in, the, forms, of, columns, terraces, and, clusters, remain, after, the, glacier, melts, and, are, known, as, glacial, deposits, glacial, deposits, that, take, the, shape, of, hills, or, mounds, are, called, kames, some, kames, form, when, meltwater, deposits, sediments, through, openings, in, the, interior, of, the, ice, others, are, produced, by, fans, or, deltas, created, by, meltwater, when, the, glacial, ice, occupies, a, valley, it, can, form, terraces, or, kames, along, the, sides, of, the, valley, long, sinuous, glacial, deposits, are, called, eskers, eskers, are, composed, of, sand, and, gravel, that, was, deposited, by, meltwater, streams, that, flowed, through, ice, tunnels, within, or, beneath, a, glacier, they, remain, after, the, ice, melts, with, heights, exceeding, 100, meters, and, lengths, of, as, long, as, 100, km, very, fine, glacial, sediments, or, rock, flour, is, often, picked, up, by, wind, blowing, over, the, bare, surface, and, may, be, deposited, great, distances, from, the, original, fluvial, deposition, site, these, eolian, loess, deposits, may, be, very, deep, even, hundreds, of, meters, as, in, areas, of, china, and, the, midwestern, united, states, katabatic, winds, can, be, important, in, this, process, glaciers, which, can, be, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, old, are, used, to, track, climate, change, over, long, periods, of, time, researchers, melt, or, crush, samples, from, glacier, ice, cores, whose, progressively, deep, layers, represent, respectively, earlier, times, in, earth, s, climate, history, the, researchers, apply, various, instruments, to, the, content, of, bubbles, trapped, in, the, cores, layers, in, order, to, track, changes, in, the, atmosphere, s, composition, temperatures, are, deduced, from, differing, relative, concentrations, of, respective, gases, confirming, that, for, at, least, the, last, million, years, global, temperatures, have, been, linked, to, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, human, activities, in, the, industrial, era, have, increased, the, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, and, other, heat, trapping, greenhouse, gases, in, the, air, causing, current, global, warming, human, influence, is, the, principal, driver, of, changes, to, the, cryosphere, of, which, glaciers, are, a, part, global, warming, creates, positive, feedback, loops, with, glaciers, for, example, in, ice, albedo, feedback, rising, temperatures, increase, glacier, melt, exposing, more, of, earth, s, land, and, sea, surface, which, is, darker, than, glacier, ice, allowing, sunlight, to, warm, the, surface, rather, than, being, reflected, back, into, space, reference, glaciers, tracked, by, the, world, glacier, monitoring, service, have, lost, ice, every, year, since, 1988, a, study, that, investigated, the, period, 1995, to, 2022, showed, that, the, flow, velocity, of, glaciers, in, the, alps, accelerates, and, slows, down, to, a, similar, extent, at, the, same, time, despite, large, distances, this, clearly, shows, that, their, speed, is, controlled, by, the, climate, change, water, runoff, from, melting, glaciers, causes, global, sea, level, to, rise, a, phenomenon, the, ipcc, terms, a, slow, onset, event, impacts, at, least, partially, attributable, to, sea, level, rise, include, for, example, encroachment, on, coastal, settlements, and, infrastructure, existential, threats, to, small, islands, and, low, lying, coasts, losses, of, coastal, ecosystems, and, ecosystem, services, groundwater, salinization, and, compounding, damage, from, tropical, cyclones, flooding, storm, surges, and, land, subsidence, large, masses, such, as, ice, sheets, or, glaciers, can, depress, the, crust, of, the, earth, into, the, mantle, the, depression, usually, totals, a, third, of, the, ice, sheet, or, glacier, s, thickness, after, the, ice, sheet, or, glacier, melts, the, mantle, begins, to, flow, back, to, its, original, position, pushing, the, crust, back, up, this, post, glacial, rebound, which, proceeds, very, slowly, after, the, melting, of, the, ice, sheet, or, glacier, is, currently, occurring, in, measurable, amounts, in, scandinavia, and, the, great, lakes, region, of, north, america, a, geomorphological, feature, created, by, the, same, process, on, a, smaller, scale, is, known, as, dilation, faulting, it, occurs, where, previously, compressed, rock, is, allowed, to, return, to, its, original, shape, more, rapidly, than, can, be, maintained, without, faulting, this, leads, to, an, effect, similar, to, what, would, be, seen, if, the, rock, were, hit, by, a, large, hammer, dilation, faulting, can, be, observed, in, recently, de, glaciated, parts, of, iceland, and, cumbria, the, polar, ice, caps, of, mars, show, geologic, evidence, of, glacial, deposits, the, south, polar, cap, is, especially, comparable, to, glaciers, on, earth, topographical, features, and, computer, models, indicate, the, existence, of, more, glaciers, in, mars, past, at, mid, latitudes, between, 35, and, 65, north, or, south, martian, glaciers, are, affected, by, the, thin, martian, atmosphere, because, of, the, low, atmospheric, pressure, ablation, near, the, surface, is, solely, caused, by, sublimation, not, melting, as, on, earth, many, glaciers, are, covered, with, a, layer, of, rocks, which, insulates, the, ice, a, radar, instrument, on, board, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, found, ice, under, a, thin, layer, of, rocks, in, formations, called, lobate, debris, aprons, ldas, in, 2015, as, new, horizons, flew, by, the, pluto, charon, system, the, spacecraft, discovered, a, massive, basin, covered, in, a, layer, of, nitrogen, ice, on, pluto, a, large, portion, of, the, basin, s, surface, is, divided, into, irregular, polygonal, features, separated, by, narrow, troughs, interpreted, as, convection, cells, fuelled, by, internal, heat, from, pluto, s, interior, glacial, flows, were, also, observed, near, sputnik, planitia, s, margins, appearing, to, flow, both, into, and, out, of, the, basin
