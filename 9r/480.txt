potassium, nitrate, is, a, chemical, compound, with, a, sharp, salty, bitter, taste, and, the, chemical, formula, k, n, o, 3, it, is, an, ionic, salt, of, potassium, ions, k, and, nitrate, ions, no, 3, and, is, therefore, an, alkali, metal, nitrate, it, occurs, in, nature, as, a, mineral, niter, or, nitre, outside, the, us, it, is, a, source, of, nitrogen, and, nitrogen, was, named, after, niter, potassium, nitrate, is, one, of, several, nitrogen, containing, compounds, collectively, referred, to, as, saltpeter, or, saltpetre, outside, the, us, major, uses, of, potassium, nitrate, are, in, fertilizers, tree, stump, removal, rocket, propellants, and, fireworks, it, is, one, of, the, major, constituents, of, gunpowder, black, powder, in, processed, meats, potassium, nitrate, reacts, with, hemoglobin, and, myoglobin, generating, a, red, color, nitre, or, potassium, nitrate, because, of, its, early, and, global, use, and, production, has, many, names, as, for, nitrate, hebrew, and, egyptian, words, for, it, had, the, consonants, n, t, r, indicating, likely, cognation, in, the, greek, nitron, which, was, latinised, to, nitrum, or, nitrium, thence, old, french, had, niter, and, middle, english, nitre, by, the, 15th, century, europeans, referred, to, it, as, saltpetre, specifically, indian, saltpetre, chilean, saltpetre, is, sodium, nitrate, and, later, as, nitrate, of, potash, as, the, chemistry, of, the, compound, was, more, fully, understood, the, arabs, called, it, chinese, snow, arabic, romanized, thalj, al, n, as, well, as, b, r, d, a, term, of, uncertain, origin, that, later, came, to, mean, gunpowder, it, was, called, chinese, salt, by, the, iranians, persians, or, salt, from, chinese, salt, marshes, persian, namak, sh, ra, ch, n, 335, the, tiangong, kaiwu, published, in, the, 17th, century, by, members, of, the, qing, dynasty, detailed, the, production, of, gunpowder, and, other, useful, products, from, nature, in, mauryan, india, saltpeter, manufacturers, formed, the, nuniya, labana, caste, saltpeter, finds, mention, in, kautilya, s, arthashastra, compiled, 300bc, 300ad, which, mentions, using, its, poisonous, smoke, as, a, weapon, of, war, although, its, use, for, propulsion, did, not, appear, until, medieval, times, a, purification, process, for, potassium, nitrate, was, outlined, in, 1270, by, the, chemist, and, engineer, hasan, al, rammah, of, syria, in, his, book, al, furusiyya, wa, al, manasib, al, harbiyya, the, book, of, military, horsemanship, and, ingenious, war, devices, in, this, book, al, rammah, describes, first, the, purification, of, barud, crude, saltpeter, mineral, by, boiling, it, with, minimal, water, and, using, only, the, hot, solution, then, the, use, of, potassium, oxide, in, the, form, of, wood, ashes, to, remove, calcium, and, magnesium, by, precipitation, of, their, carbonates, from, this, solution, leaving, a, solution, of, purified, potassium, nitrate, which, could, then, be, dried, this, was, used, for, the, manufacture, of, gunpowder, and, explosive, devices, the, terminology, used, by, al, rammah, indicated, the, gunpowder, he, wrote, about, originated, in, china, at, least, as, far, back, as, 1845, nitratite, deposits, were, exploited, in, chile, and, california, major, natural, sources, of, potassium, nitrate, were, the, deposits, crystallizing, from, cave, walls, and, the, accumulations, of, bat, guano, in, caves, extraction, is, accomplished, by, immersing, the, guano, in, water, for, a, day, filtering, and, harvesting, the, crystals, in, the, filtered, water, traditionally, guano, was, the, source, used, in, laos, for, the, manufacture, of, gunpowder, for, bang, fai, rockets, calcium, nitrate, or, lime, saltpetre, was, discovered, on, the, walls, of, stables, from, the, urine, of, barnyard, animals, potassium, nitrate, was, produced, in, a, nitrary, or, saltpetre, works, the, process, involved, burial, of, excrements, human, or, animal, in, a, field, beside, the, nitraries, watering, them, and, waiting, until, leaching, allowed, saltpeter, to, migrate, to, the, surface, by, efflorescence, operators, then, gathered, the, resulting, powder, and, transported, it, to, be, concentrated, by, ebullition, in, the, boiler, plant, besides, montepellusanus, during, the, thirteenth, century, and, beyond, the, only, supply, of, saltpeter, across, christian, europe, according, to, de, alchimia, in, 3, manuscripts, of, michael, scot, 1180, 1236, was, found, in, spain, in, aragon, in, a, certain, mountain, near, the, sea, 89, 311, in, 1561, elizabeth, i, queen, of, england, and, ireland, who, was, at, war, with, philip, ii, of, spain, became, unable, to, import, saltpeter, of, which, the, kingdom, of, england, had, no, home, production, and, had, to, pay, 300, pounds, gold, to, the, german, captain, gerrard, honrik, for, the, manual, instructions, for, making, saltpeter, to, growe, the, secret, of, the, feuerwerkbuch, the, nitraries, a, nitre, bed, is, a, similar, process, used, to, produce, nitrate, from, excrement, unlike, the, leaching, based, process, of, the, nitrary, however, one, mixes, the, excrements, with, soil, and, waits, for, soil, microbes, to, convert, amino, nitrogen, into, nitrates, by, nitrification, the, nitrates, are, extracted, from, soil, with, water, and, then, purified, into, saltpeter, by, adding, wood, ash, the, process, was, discovered, in, the, early, 15th, century, and, was, very, widely, used, until, the, chilean, mineral, deposits, were, found, the, confederate, side, of, the, american, civil, war, had, a, significant, shortage, of, saltpeter, as, a, result, the, nitre, and, mining, bureau, was, set, up, to, encourage, local, production, including, by, nitre, beds, and, by, providing, excrement, to, government, nitraries, on, november, 13, 1862, the, government, advertised, in, the, charleston, daily, courier, for, 20, or, 30, able, bodied, negro, men, to, work, in, the, new, nitre, beds, at, ashley, ferry, s, c, the, nitre, beds, were, large, rectangles, of, rotted, manure, and, straw, moistened, weekly, with, urine, dung, water, and, liquid, from, privies, cesspools, and, drains, and, turned, over, regularly, the, national, archives, published, payroll, records, that, account, for, more, than, 29, 000, people, compelled, to, such, labor, in, the, state, of, virginia, the, south, was, so, desperate, for, saltpeter, for, gunpowder, that, one, alabama, official, reportedly, placed, a, newspaper, ad, asking, that, the, contents, of, chamber, pots, be, saved, for, collection, in, south, carolina, in, april, 1864, the, confederate, government, forced, 31, enslaved, people, to, work, at, the, ashley, ferry, nitre, works, outside, charleston, perhaps, the, most, exhaustive, discussion, of, the, niter, bed, production, is, the, 1862, leconte, text, he, was, writing, with, the, express, purpose, of, increasing, production, in, the, confederate, states, to, support, their, needs, during, the, american, civil, war, since, he, was, calling, for, the, assistance, of, rural, farming, communities, the, descriptions, and, instructions, are, both, simple, and, explicit, he, details, the, french, method, along, with, several, variations, as, well, as, a, swiss, method, n, b, many, references, have, been, made, to, a, method, using, only, straw, and, urine, but, there, is, no, such, method, in, this, work, turgot, and, lavoisier, created, the, r, gie, des, poudres, et, salp, tres, a, few, years, before, the, french, revolution, niter, beds, were, prepared, by, mixing, manure, with, either, mortar, or, wood, ashes, common, earth, and, organic, materials, such, as, straw, to, give, porosity, to, a, compost, pile, typically, 4, feet, 1, 2, m, high, 6, feet, 1, 8, m, wide, and, 15, feet, 4, 6, m, long, the, heap, was, usually, under, a, cover, from, the, rain, kept, moist, with, urine, turned, often, to, accelerate, the, decomposition, then, finally, leached, with, water, after, approximately, one, year, to, remove, the, soluble, calcium, nitrate, which, was, then, converted, to, potassium, nitrate, by, filtering, through, potash, joseph, leconte, describes, a, process, using, only, urine, and, not, dung, referring, to, it, as, the, swiss, method, urine, is, collected, directly, in, a, sandpit, under, a, stable, the, sand, itself, is, dug, out, and, leached, for, nitrates, which, are, then, converted, to, potassium, nitrate, using, potash, as, above, from, 1903, until, the, world, war, i, era, potassium, nitrate, for, black, powder, and, fertilizer, was, produced, on, an, industrial, scale, from, nitric, acid, produced, using, the, birkeland, eyde, process, which, used, an, electric, arc, to, oxidize, nitrogen, from, the, air, during, world, war, i, the, newly, industrialized, haber, process, 1913, was, combined, with, the, ostwald, process, after, 1915, allowing, germany, to, produce, nitric, acid, for, the, war, after, being, cut, off, from, its, supplies, of, mineral, sodium, nitrates, from, chile, see, nitratite, potassium, nitrate, can, be, made, by, combining, ammonium, nitrate, and, potassium, hydroxide, an, alternative, way, of, producing, potassium, nitrate, without, a, by, product, of, ammonia, is, to, combine, ammonium, nitrate, found, in, instant, ice, packs, and, potassium, chloride, easily, obtained, as, a, sodium, free, salt, substitute, potassium, nitrate, can, also, be, produced, by, neutralizing, nitric, acid, with, potassium, hydroxide, this, reaction, is, highly, exothermic, on, industrial, scale, it, is, prepared, by, the, double, displacement, reaction, between, sodium, nitrate, and, potassium, chloride, potassium, nitrate, has, an, orthorhombic, crystal, structure, at, room, temperature, which, transforms, to, a, trigonal, system, at, 128, c, 262, f, on, cooling, from, 200, c, 392, f, another, trigonal, phase, forms, between, 124, c, 255, f, and, 100, c, 212, f, sodium, nitrate, is, isomorphous, with, calcite, the, most, stable, form, of, calcium, carbonate, whereas, room, temperature, potassium, nitrate, is, isomorphous, with, aragonite, a, slightly, less, stable, polymorph, of, calcium, carbonate, the, difference, is, attributed, to, the, similarity, in, size, between, nitrate, no, 3, and, carbonate, co, 2, 3, ions, and, the, fact, that, the, potassium, ion, k, is, larger, than, sodium, na, and, calcium, ca, 2, ions, in, the, room, temperature, structure, of, potassium, nitrate, each, potassium, ion, is, surrounded, by, 6, nitrate, ions, in, turn, each, nitrate, ion, is, surrounded, by, 6, potassium, ions, potassium, nitrate, is, moderately, soluble, in, water, but, its, solubility, increases, with, temperature, the, aqueous, solution, is, almost, neutral, exhibiting, ph, 6, 2, at, 14, c, 57, f, for, a, 10, solution, of, commercial, powder, it, is, not, very, hygroscopic, absorbing, about, 0, 03, water, in, 80, relative, humidity, over, 50, days, it, is, insoluble, in, alcohol, and, is, not, poisonous, it, can, react, explosively, with, reducing, agents, but, it, is, not, explosive, on, its, own, between, 550, 790, c, 1, 022, 1, 454, f, potassium, nitrate, reaches, a, temperature, dependent, equilibrium, with, potassium, nitrite, potassium, nitrate, has, a, wide, variety, of, uses, largely, as, a, source, of, nitrate, historically, nitric, acid, was, produced, by, combining, sulfuric, acid, with, nitrates, such, as, saltpeter, in, modern, times, this, is, reversed, nitrates, are, produced, from, nitric, acid, produced, via, the, ostwald, process, the, most, famous, use, of, potassium, nitrate, is, probably, as, the, oxidizer, in, blackpowder, from, the, most, ancient, times, until, the, late, 1880s, blackpowder, provided, the, explosive, power, for, all, the, world, s, firearms, after, that, time, small, arms, and, large, artillery, increasingly, began, to, depend, on, cordite, a, smokeless, powder, blackpowder, remains, in, use, today, in, black, powder, rocket, motors, but, also, in, combination, with, other, fuels, like, sugars, in, rocket, candy, a, popular, amateur, rocket, propellant, it, is, also, used, in, fireworks, such, as, smoke, bombs, it, is, also, added, to, cigarettes, to, maintain, an, even, burn, of, the, tobacco, and, is, used, to, ensure, complete, combustion, of, paper, cartridges, for, cap, and, ball, revolvers, it, can, also, be, heated, to, several, hundred, degrees, to, be, used, for, niter, bluing, which, is, less, durable, than, other, forms, of, protective, oxidation, but, allows, for, specific, and, often, beautiful, coloration, of, steel, parts, such, as, screws, pins, and, other, small, parts, of, firearms, potassium, nitrate, has, been, a, common, ingredient, of, salted, meat, since, antiquity, or, the, middle, ages, the, widespread, adoption, of, nitrate, use, is, more, recent, and, is, linked, to, the, development, of, large, scale, meat, processing, the, use, of, potassium, nitrate, has, been, mostly, discontinued, because, it, gives, slow, and, inconsistent, results, compared, with, sodium, nitrite, preparations, such, as, prague, powder, or, pink, curing, salt, even, so, potassium, nitrate, is, still, used, in, some, food, applications, such, as, salami, dry, cured, ham, charcuterie, and, in, some, countries, in, the, brine, used, to, make, corned, beef, sometimes, together, with, sodium, nitrite, in, the, shetland, islands, uk, it, is, used, in, the, curing, of, mutton, to, make, reestit, mutton, a, local, delicacy, when, used, as, a, food, additive, in, the, european, union, the, compound, is, referred, to, as, e252, it, is, also, approved, for, use, as, a, food, additive, in, the, united, states, and, australia, and, new, zealand, where, it, is, listed, under, its, ins, number, 252, since, october, 2015, who, classifies, processed, meat, as, group, 1, carcinogen, based, on, epidemiological, studies, convincingly, carcinogenic, to, humans, in, april, 2023, the, french, court, of, appeals, of, limoges, confirmed, that, food, watch, ngo, yuka, was, legally, legitimate, in, describing, potassium, nitrate, e249, to, e252, as, a, cancer, risk, and, thus, rejected, an, appeal, by, the, french, charcuterie, industry, against, the, organisation, potassium, nitrate, is, used, in, fertilizers, as, a, source, of, nitrogen, and, potassium, two, of, the, macronutrients, for, plants, when, used, by, itself, it, has, an, npk, rating, of, 13, 0, 44, potassium, nitrate, was, once, thought, to, induce, impotence, and, is, still, rumored, to, be, in, institutional, food, such, as, military, fare, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, for, such, properties, in, bank, shot, el,
