the, water, cycle, or, hydrologic, cycle, or, hydrological, cycle, is, a, biogeochemical, cycle, that, involves, the, continuous, movement, of, water, on, above, and, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, mass, of, water, on, earth, remains, fairly, constant, over, time, however, the, partitioning, of, the, water, into, the, major, reservoirs, of, ice, fresh, water, salt, water, and, atmospheric, water, is, variable, and, depends, on, climatic, variables, the, water, moves, from, one, reservoir, to, another, such, as, from, river, to, ocean, or, from, the, ocean, to, the, atmosphere, the, processes, that, drive, these, movements, are, evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, sublimation, infiltration, surface, runoff, and, subsurface, flow, in, doing, so, the, water, goes, through, different, forms, liquid, solid, ice, and, vapor, the, ocean, plays, a, key, role, in, the, water, cycle, as, it, is, the, source, of, 86, of, global, evaporation, the, water, cycle, involves, the, exchange, of, energy, which, leads, to, temperature, changes, when, water, evaporates, it, takes, up, energy, from, its, surroundings, and, cools, the, environment, when, it, condenses, it, releases, energy, and, warms, the, environment, these, heat, exchanges, influence, the, climate, system, the, evaporative, phase, of, the, cycle, purifies, water, because, it, causes, salts, and, other, solids, picked, up, during, the, cycle, to, be, left, behind, the, condensation, phase, in, the, atmosphere, replenishes, the, land, with, freshwater, the, flow, of, liquid, water, and, ice, transports, minerals, across, the, globe, it, also, reshapes, the, geological, features, of, the, earth, through, processes, including, erosion, and, sedimentation, the, water, cycle, is, also, essential, for, the, maintenance, of, most, life, and, ecosystems, on, the, planet, human, actions, are, greatly, affecting, the, water, cycle, activities, such, as, deforestation, urbanization, and, the, extraction, of, groundwater, are, altering, natural, landscapes, land, use, changes, all, have, an, effect, on, the, water, cycle, 1153, on, top, of, this, climate, change, is, leading, to, an, intensification, of, the, water, cycle, research, has, shown, that, global, warming, is, causing, shifts, in, precipitation, patterns, increased, frequency, of, extreme, weather, events, and, changes, in, the, timing, and, intensity, of, rainfall, 85, these, water, cycle, changes, affect, ecosystems, water, availability, agriculture, and, human, societies, the, water, cycle, is, powered, from, the, energy, emitted, by, the, sun, this, energy, heats, water, in, the, ocean, and, seas, water, evaporates, as, water, vapor, into, the, air, some, ice, and, snow, sublimates, directly, into, water, vapor, evapotranspiration, is, water, transpired, from, plants, and, evaporated, from, the, soil, the, water, molecule, h, 2, o, has, smaller, molecular, mass, than, the, major, components, of, the, atmosphere, nitrogen, n, 2, and, oxygen, o, 2, and, hence, is, less, dense, due, to, the, significant, difference, in, density, buoyancy, drives, humid, air, higher, as, altitude, increases, air, pressure, decreases, and, the, temperature, drops, see, gas, laws, the, lower, temperature, causes, water, vapor, to, condense, into, tiny, liquid, water, droplets, which, are, heavier, than, the, air, and, which, fall, unless, supported, by, an, updraft, a, huge, concentration, of, these, droplets, over, a, large, area, in, the, atmosphere, becomes, visible, as, cloud, while, condensation, near, ground, level, is, referred, to, as, fog, atmospheric, circulation, moves, water, vapor, around, the, globe, cloud, particles, collide, grow, and, fall, out, of, the, upper, atmospheric, layers, as, precipitation, some, precipitation, falls, as, snow, hail, or, sleet, and, can, accumulate, in, ice, caps, and, glaciers, which, can, store, frozen, water, for, thousands, of, years, most, water, falls, as, rain, back, into, the, ocean, or, onto, land, where, the, water, flows, over, the, ground, as, surface, runoff, a, portion, of, this, runoff, enters, rivers, with, streamflow, moving, water, towards, the, oceans, runoff, and, water, emerging, from, the, ground, groundwater, may, be, stored, as, freshwater, in, lakes, not, all, runoff, flows, into, rivers, much, of, it, soaks, into, the, ground, as, infiltration, some, water, infiltrates, deep, into, the, ground, and, replenishes, aquifers, which, can, store, freshwater, for, long, periods, of, time, some, infiltration, stays, close, to, the, land, surface, and, can, seep, back, into, surface, water, bodies, and, the, ocean, as, groundwater, discharge, or, be, taken, up, by, plants, and, transferred, back, to, the, atmosphere, as, water, vapor, by, transpiration, some, groundwater, finds, openings, in, the, land, surface, and, emerges, as, freshwater, springs, in, river, valleys, and, floodplains, there, is, often, continuous, water, exchange, between, surface, water, and, ground, water, in, the, hyporheic, zone, over, time, the, water, returns, to, the, ocean, to, continue, the, water, cycle, the, ocean, plays, a, key, role, in, the, water, cycle, the, ocean, holds, 97, of, the, total, water, on, the, planet, 78, of, global, precipitation, occurs, over, the, ocean, and, it, is, the, source, of, 86, of, global, evaporation, important, physical, processes, within, the, water, cycle, include, in, alphabetical, order, the, residence, time, of, a, reservoir, within, the, hydrologic, cycle, is, the, average, time, a, water, molecule, will, spend, in, that, reservoir, see, table, it, is, a, measure, of, the, average, age, of, the, water, in, that, reservoir, groundwater, can, spend, over, 10, 000, years, beneath, earth, s, surface, before, leaving, particularly, old, groundwater, is, called, fossil, water, water, stored, in, the, soil, remains, there, very, briefly, because, it, is, spread, thinly, across, the, earth, and, is, readily, lost, by, evaporation, transpiration, stream, flow, or, groundwater, recharge, after, evaporating, the, residence, time, in, the, atmosphere, is, about, 9, days, before, condensing, and, falling, to, the, earth, as, precipitation, the, major, ice, sheets, antarctica, and, greenland, store, ice, for, very, long, periods, ice, from, antarctica, has, been, reliably, dated, to, 800, 000, years, before, present, though, the, average, residence, time, is, shorter, in, hydrology, residence, times, can, be, estimated, in, two, ways, the, more, common, method, relies, on, the, principle, of, conservation, of, mass, water, balance, and, assumes, the, amount, of, water, in, a, given, reservoir, is, roughly, constant, with, this, method, residence, times, are, estimated, by, dividing, the, volume, of, the, reservoir, by, the, rate, by, which, water, either, enters, or, exits, the, reservoir, conceptually, this, is, equivalent, to, timing, how, long, it, would, take, the, reservoir, to, become, filled, from, empty, if, no, water, were, to, leave, or, how, long, it, would, take, the, reservoir, to, empty, from, full, if, no, water, were, to, enter, an, alternative, method, to, estimate, residence, times, which, is, gaining, in, popularity, for, dating, groundwater, is, the, use, of, isotopic, techniques, this, is, done, in, the, subfield, of, isotope, hydrology, the, water, cycle, describes, the, processes, that, drive, the, movement, of, water, throughout, the, hydrosphere, however, much, more, water, is, in, storage, or, in, pools, for, long, periods, of, time, than, is, actually, moving, through, the, cycle, the, storehouses, for, the, vast, majority, of, all, water, on, earth, are, the, oceans, it, is, estimated, that, of, the, 1, 386, 000, 000, km, 3, of, the, world, s, water, supply, about, 1, 338, 000, 000, km, 3, is, stored, in, oceans, or, about, 97, it, is, also, estimated, that, the, oceans, supply, about, 90, of, the, evaporated, water, that, goes, into, the, water, cycle, the, earth, s, ice, caps, glaciers, and, permanent, snowpack, stores, another, 24, 064, 000, km, 3, accounting, for, only, 1, 7, of, the, planet, s, total, water, volume, however, this, quantity, of, water, is, 68, 7, of, all, freshwater, on, the, planet, human, activities, can, alter, the, water, cycle, at, the, local, or, regional, level, this, happens, due, to, changes, in, land, use, and, land, cover, such, changes, affect, precipitation, evaporation, flooding, groundwater, and, the, availability, of, freshwater, for, a, variety, of, uses, 1153, examples, for, such, land, use, changes, are, converting, fields, to, urban, areas, or, clearing, forests, such, changes, can, affect, the, ability, of, soils, to, soak, up, surface, water, deforestation, has, local, as, well, as, regional, effects, for, example, it, reduces, soil, moisture, evaporation, and, rainfall, at, the, local, level, furthermore, deforestation, causes, regional, temperature, changes, that, can, affect, rainfall, patterns, 1153, aquifer, drawdown, or, overdrafting, and, the, pumping, of, fossil, water, increase, the, total, amount, of, water, in, the, hydrosphere, this, is, because, the, water, that, was, originally, in, the, ground, has, now, become, available, for, evaporation, as, it, is, now, in, contact, with, the, atmosphere, 1153, since, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, human, caused, climate, change, has, resulted, in, observable, changes, in, the, global, water, cycle, 85, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, in, 2021, predicted, that, these, changes, will, continue, to, grow, significantly, at, the, global, and, regional, level, 85, these, findings, are, a, continuation, of, scientific, consensus, expressed, in, the, ipcc, fifth, assessment, report, from, 2007, and, other, special, reports, by, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, which, had, already, stated, that, the, water, cycle, will, continue, to, intensify, throughout, the, 21st, century, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, water, cycle, are, profound, and, have, been, described, as, an, intensification, or, a, strengthening, of, the, water, cycle, also, called, hydrologic, cycle, 1079, this, effect, has, been, observed, since, at, least, 1980, 1079, one, example, is, when, heavy, rain, events, become, even, stronger, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, water, cycle, have, important, negative, effects, on, the, availability, of, freshwater, resources, as, well, as, other, water, reservoirs, such, as, oceans, ice, sheets, the, atmosphere, and, soil, moisture, the, water, cycle, is, essential, to, life, on, earth, and, plays, a, large, role, in, the, global, climate, system, and, ocean, circulation, the, warming, of, our, planet, is, expected, to, be, accompanied, by, changes, in, the, water, cycle, for, various, reasons, for, example, a, warmer, atmosphere, can, contain, more, water, vapor, which, has, effects, on, evaporation, and, rainfall, the, underlying, cause, of, the, intensifying, water, cycle, is, the, increased, amount, of, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere, which, lead, to, a, warmer, atmosphere, through, the, greenhouse, effect, fundamental, laws, of, physics, explain, how, the, saturation, vapor, pressure, in, the, atmosphere, increases, by, 7, when, temperature, rises, by, 1, c, this, relationship, is, known, as, the, clausius, clapeyron, equation, while, the, water, cycle, is, itself, a, biogeochemical, cycle, flow, of, water, over, and, beneath, the, earth, is, a, key, component, of, the, cycling, of, other, biogeochemicals, runoff, is, responsible, for, almost, all, of, the, transport, of, eroded, sediment, and, phosphorus, from, land, to, waterbodies, the, salinity, of, the, oceans, is, derived, from, erosion, and, transport, of, dissolved, salts, from, the, land, cultural, eutrophication, of, lakes, is, primarily, due, to, phosphorus, applied, in, excess, to, agricultural, fields, in, fertilizers, and, then, transported, overland, and, down, rivers, both, runoff, and, groundwater, flow, play, significant, roles, in, transporting, nitrogen, from, the, land, to, waterbodies, the, dead, zone, at, the, outlet, of, the, mississippi, river, is, a, consequence, of, nitrates, from, fertilizer, being, carried, off, agricultural, fields, and, funnelled, down, the, river, system, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, runoff, also, plays, a, part, in, the, carbon, cycle, again, through, the, transport, of, eroded, rock, and, soil, the, hydrodynamic, wind, within, the, upper, portion, of, a, planet, s, atmosphere, allows, light, chemical, elements, such, as, hydrogen, to, move, up, to, the, exobase, the, lower, limit, of, the, exosphere, where, the, gases, can, then, reach, escape, velocity, entering, outer, space, without, impacting, other, particles, of, gas, this, type, of, gas, loss, from, a, planet, into, space, is, known, as, planetary, wind, planets, with, hot, lower, atmospheres, could, result, in, humid, upper, atmospheres, that, accelerate, the, loss, of, hydrogen, in, ancient, times, it, was, widely, thought, that, the, land, mass, floated, on, a, body, of, water, and, that, most, of, the, water, in, rivers, has, its, origin, under, the, earth, examples, of, this, belief, can, be, found, in, the, works, of, homer, c, 800, bce, in, works, and, days, ca, 700, bc, the, greek, poet, hesiod, outlines, the, idea, of, the, water, cycle, is, drawn, from, the, ever, flowing, rivers, and, is, raised, high, above, the, earth, by, windstorm, and, sometimes, it, turns, to, rain, towards, evening, and, sometimes, to, wind, when, thracian, boreas, huddles, the, thick, clouds, in, the, ancient, near, east, hebrew, scholars, observed, that, even, though, the, rivers, ran, into, the, sea, the, sea, never, became, full, some, scholars, conclude, that, the, water, cycle, was, described, completely, during, this, time, in, this, passage, the, wind, goeth, toward, the, south, and, turneth, about, unto, the, north, it, whirleth, about, continually, and, the, wind, returneth, again, according, to, its, circuits, all, the, rivers, run, into, the, sea, yet, the, sea, is, not, full, unto, the, place, from, whence, the, rivers, come, thither, they, return, again, ecclesiastes, 1, 6, 7, furthermore, it, was, also, observed, that, when, the, clouds, were, full, they, emptied, rain, on, the, earth, ecclesiastes, 11, 3, in, the, adityahridayam, a, devotional, hymn, to, the, sun, god, of, ramayana, a, hindu, epic, dated, to, the, 4th, century, bce, it, is, mentioned, in, the, 22nd, verse, that, the, sun, heats, up, water, and, sends, it, down, as, rain, by, roughly, 500, bce, greek, scholars, were, speculating, that, much, of, the, water, in, rivers, can, be, attributed, to, rain, the, origin, of, rain, was, also, known, by, then, these, scholars, maintained, the, belief, however, that, water, rising, up, through, the, earth, contributed, a, great, deal, to, rivers, examples, of, this, thinking, included, anaximander, 570, bce, who, also, speculated, about, the, evolution, of, land, animals, from, fish, and, xenophanes, of, colophon, 530, bce, warring, states, period, chinese, scholars, such, as, chi, ni, tzu, 320, bce, and, lu, shih, ch, un, ch, iu, 239, bce, had, similar, thoughts, the, idea, that, the, water, cycle, is, a, closed, cycle, can, be, found, in, the, works, of, anaxagoras, of, clazomenae, 460, bce, and, diogenes, of, apollonia, 460, bce, both, plato, 390, bce, and, aristotle, 350, bce, speculated, about, percolation, as, part, of, the, water, cycle, aristotle, correctly, hypothesized, that, the, sun, played, a, role, in, the, earth, s, hydraulic, cycle, in, his, book, meteorology, writing, by, it, agency, the, finest, and, sweetest, water, is, everyday, carried, up, and, is, dissolved, into, vapor, and, rises, to, the, upper, regions, where, it, is, condensed, again, by, the, cold, and, so, returns, to, the, earth, and, believed, that, clouds, were, composed, of, cooled, and, condensed, water, vapor, much, like, the, earlier, aristotle, the, eastern, han, chinese, scientist, wang, chong, 27, 100, ad, accurately, described, the, water, cycle, of, earth, in, his, lunheng, but, was, dismissed, by, his, contemporaries, up, to, the, time, of, the, renaissance, it, was, wrongly, assumed, that, precipitation, alone, was, insufficient, to, feed, rivers, for, a, complete, water, cycle, and, that, underground, water, pushing, upwards, from, the, oceans, were, the, main, contributors, to, river, water, bartholomew, of, england, held, this, view, 1240, ce, as, did, leonardo, da, vinci, 1500, ce, and, athanasius, kircher, 1644, ce, the, first, published, thinker, to, assert, that, rainfall, alone, was, sufficient, for, the, maintenance, of, rivers, was, bernard, palissy, 1580, ce, who, is, often, credited, as, the, discoverer, of, the, modern, theory, of, the, water, cycle, palissy, s, theories, were, not, tested, scientifically, until, 1674, in, a, study, commonly, attributed, to, pierre, perrault, even, then, these, beliefs, were, not, accepted, in, mainstream, science, until, the, early, nineteenth, century
