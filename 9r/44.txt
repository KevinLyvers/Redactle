the, joule, pronounced, d, u, l, jool, or, d, a, l, jowl, symbol, j, is, the, unit, of, energy, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, work, done, when, a, force, of, one, newton, displaces, a, mass, through, a, distance, of, one, metre, in, the, direction, of, that, force, it, is, also, the, energy, dissipated, as, heat, when, an, electric, current, of, one, ampere, passes, through, a, resistance, of, one, ohm, for, one, second, it, is, named, after, the, english, physicist, james, prescott, joule, 1818, 1889, in, terms, of, si, base, units, and, in, terms, of, si, derived, units, with, special, names, the, joule, is, defined, as, j, k, g, m, 2, s, 2, n, m, p, a, m, 3, w, s, c, v, displaystyle, begin, alignedat, 3, mathrm, j, mathrm, kg, cdot, m, 2, cdot, s, 2, mathrm, n, cdot, m, mathrm, pa, cdot, m, 3, mathrm, w, cdot, s, mathrm, c, cdot, v, end, alignedat, one, joule, is, also, equivalent, to, any, of, the, following, the, joule, is, named, after, james, prescott, joule, as, with, every, si, unit, named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, j, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, joule, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, the, cgs, system, had, been, declared, official, in, 1881, at, the, first, international, electrical, congress, the, erg, was, adopted, as, its, unit, of, energy, in, 1882, wilhelm, siemens, in, his, inauguration, speech, as, chairman, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, 23, august, 1882, first, proposed, the, joule, as, unit, of, heat, to, be, derived, from, the, electromagnetic, units, ampere, and, ohm, in, cgs, units, equivalent, to, 10, 7, erg, the, naming, of, the, unit, in, honour, of, james, prescott, joule, 1818, 1889, at, the, time, retired, but, still, living, aged, 63, followed, the, recommendation, of, siemens, at, the, second, international, electrical, congress, on, 31, august, 1889, the, joule, was, officially, adopted, alongside, the, watt, and, the, quadrant, later, renamed, to, henry, joule, died, in, the, same, year, on, 11, october, 1889, at, the, fourth, congress, 1893, the, international, ampere, and, international, ohm, were, defined, with, slight, changes, in, the, specifications, for, their, measurement, with, the, international, joule, being, the, unit, derived, from, them, in, 1935, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, as, the, successor, organisation, of, the, international, electrical, congress, adopted, the, giorgi, system, which, by, virtue, of, assuming, a, defined, value, for, the, magnetic, constant, also, implied, a, redefinition, of, the, joule, the, giorgi, system, was, approved, by, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, in, 1946, the, joule, was, now, no, longer, defined, based, on, electromagnetic, unit, but, instead, as, the, unit, of, work, performed, by, one, unit, of, force, at, the, time, not, yet, named, newton, over, the, distance, of, 1, metre, the, joule, was, explicitly, intended, as, the, unit, of, energy, to, be, used, in, both, electromagnetic, and, mechanical, contexts, the, ratification, of, the, definition, at, the, ninth, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1948, added, the, specification, that, the, joule, was, also, to, be, preferred, as, the, unit, of, heat, in, the, context, of, calorimetry, thereby, officially, deprecating, the, use, of, the, calorie, this, is, the, definition, declared, in, the, modern, international, system, of, units, in, 1960, the, definition, of, the, joule, as, j, kg, m, 2, s, 2, has, remained, unchanged, since, 1946, but, the, joule, as, a, derived, unit, has, inherited, changes, in, the, definitions, of, the, second, in, 1960, and, 1967, the, metre, in, 1983, and, the, kilogram, in, 2019, one, joule, represents, approximately, 1, joule, is, equal, to, approximately, unless, otherwise, stated, units, with, exact, equivalents, in, joules, include, in, mechanics, the, concept, of, force, in, some, direction, has, a, close, analogue, in, the, concept, of, torque, about, some, angle, a, result, of, this, similarity, is, that, the, si, unit, for, torque, is, the, newton, metre, which, works, out, algebraically, to, have, the, same, dimensions, as, the, joule, but, they, are, not, interchangeable, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, has, given, the, unit, of, energy, the, name, joule, but, has, not, given, the, unit, of, torque, any, special, name, hence, it, is, simply, the, newton, metre, n, m, a, compound, name, derived, from, its, constituent, parts, the, use, of, newton, metres, for, torque, but, joules, for, energy, is, helpful, to, avoid, misunderstandings, and, miscommunication, the, distinction, may, be, seen, also, in, the, fact, that, energy, is, a, scalar, quantity, the, dot, product, of, a, force, vector, and, a, displacement, vector, by, contrast, torque, is, a, vector, the, cross, product, of, a, force, vector, and, a, distance, vector, torque, and, energy, are, related, to, one, another, by, the, equation, e, displaystyle, e, tau, theta, where, e, is, energy, is, the, vector, magnitude, of, torque, and, is, the, angle, swept, in, radians, since, plane, angles, are, dimensionless, it, follows, that, torque, and, energy, have, the, same, dimensions, a, watt, second, symbol, w, s, or, w, s, is, a, derived, unit, of, energy, equivalent, to, the, joule, the, watt, second, is, the, energy, equivalent, to, the, power, of, one, watt, sustained, for, one, second, while, the, watt, second, is, equivalent, to, the, joule, in, both, units, and, meaning, there, are, some, contexts, in, which, the, term, watt, second, is, used, instead, of, joule, such, as, in, the, rating, of, photographic, electronic, flash, units
