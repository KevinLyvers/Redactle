the, holocene, h, l, s, i, n, o, h, o, l, l, o, is, the, current, geological, epoch, beginning, approximately, 11, 700, years, ago, it, follows, the, last, glacial, period, which, concluded, with, the, holocene, glacial, retreat, the, holocene, and, the, preceding, pleistocene, together, form, the, quaternary, period, the, holocene, is, an, interglacial, period, within, the, ongoing, glacial, cycles, of, the, quaternary, and, is, equivalent, to, marine, isotope, stage, 1, the, holocene, correlates, with, the, last, maximum, axial, tilt, of, the, earth, towards, the, sun, and, corresponds, with, the, rapid, proliferation, growth, and, impacts, of, the, human, species, worldwide, including, all, of, its, written, history, technological, revolutions, development, of, major, civilizations, and, overall, significant, transition, towards, urban, living, in, the, present, the, human, impact, on, modern, era, earth, and, its, ecosystems, may, be, considered, of, global, significance, for, the, future, evolution, of, living, species, including, approximately, synchronous, lithospheric, evidence, or, more, recently, hydrospheric, and, atmospheric, evidence, of, the, human, impact, in, july, 2018, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, split, the, holocene, epoch, into, three, distinct, ages, based, on, the, climate, greenlandian, 11, 700, years, ago, to, 8, 200, years, ago, northgrippian, 8, 200, years, ago, to, 4, 200, years, ago, and, meghalayan, 4, 200, years, ago, to, the, present, as, proposed, by, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, the, oldest, age, the, greenlandian, was, characterized, by, a, warming, following, the, preceding, ice, age, the, northgrippian, age, is, known, for, vast, cooling, due, to, a, disruption, in, ocean, circulations, that, was, caused, by, the, melting, of, glaciers, the, most, recent, age, of, the, holocene, is, the, present, meghalayan, which, began, with, extreme, drought, that, lasted, around, 200, years, the, word, holocene, was, formed, from, two, ancient, greek, words, h, los, is, the, greek, word, for, whole, cene, comes, from, the, greek, word, kain, s, meaning, new, the, concept, is, that, this, epoch, is, entirely, new, the, suffix, cene, is, used, for, all, the, seven, epochs, of, the, cenozoic, era, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, has, defined, the, holocene, as, starting, approximately, 11, 700, years, before, 2000, ce, 11, 650, cal, years, bp, or, 9, 700, bce, the, subcommission, on, quaternary, stratigraphy, sqs, regards, the, term, recent, as, an, incorrect, way, of, referring, to, the, holocene, preferring, the, term, modern, instead, to, describe, current, processes, it, also, observes, that, the, term, flandrian, may, be, used, as, a, synonym, for, holocene, although, it, is, becoming, outdated, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, however, considers, the, holocene, to, be, an, epoch, following, the, pleistocene, and, specifically, following, the, last, glacial, period, local, names, for, the, last, glacial, period, include, the, wisconsinan, in, north, america, the, weichselian, in, europe, the, devensian, in, britain, the, llanquihue, in, chile, and, the, otiran, in, new, zealand, the, holocene, can, be, subdivided, into, five, time, intervals, or, chronozones, based, on, climatic, fluctuations, geologists, working, in, different, regions, are, studying, sea, levels, peat, bogs, and, ice, core, samples, using, a, variety, of, methods, with, a, view, toward, further, verifying, and, refining, the, blytt, sernander, sequence, this, is, a, classification, of, climatic, periods, initially, defined, by, plant, remains, in, peat, mosses, though, the, method, was, once, thought, to, be, of, little, interest, based, on, 14, c, dating, of, peats, that, was, inconsistent, with, the, claimed, chronozones, investigators, have, found, a, general, correspondence, across, eurasia, and, north, america, the, scheme, was, defined, for, northern, europe, but, the, climate, changes, were, claimed, to, occur, more, widely, the, periods, of, the, scheme, include, a, few, of, the, final, pre, holocene, oscillations, of, the, last, glacial, period, and, then, classify, climates, of, more, recent, prehistory, paleontologists, have, not, defined, any, faunal, stages, for, the, holocene, if, subdivision, is, necessary, periods, of, human, technological, development, such, as, the, mesolithic, neolithic, and, bronze, age, are, usually, used, however, the, time, periods, referenced, by, these, terms, vary, with, the, emergence, of, those, technologies, in, different, parts, of, the, world, according, to, some, scholars, a, third, epoch, of, the, quaternary, the, anthropocene, has, now, begun, this, term, is, used, to, denote, the, present, time, interval, in, which, many, geologically, significant, conditions, and, processes, have, been, profoundly, altered, by, human, activities, the, anthropocene, a, term, coined, by, paul, j, crutzen, and, eugene, stoermer, in, 2000, is, not, a, formally, defined, geological, unit, the, subcommission, on, quaternary, stratigraphy, of, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, has, a, working, group, to, determine, whether, it, should, be, in, may, 2019, members, of, the, working, group, voted, in, favour, of, recognizing, the, anthropocene, as, formal, chrono, stratigraphic, unit, with, stratigraphic, signals, around, the, mid, twentieth, century, ce, as, its, base, the, exact, criteria, have, still, to, be, determined, after, which, the, recommendation, also, has, to, be, approved, by, the, working, group, s, parent, bodies, ultimately, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, the, holocene, is, a, geologic, epoch, that, follows, directly, after, the, pleistocene, continental, motions, due, to, plate, tectonics, are, less, than, a, kilometre, over, a, span, of, only, 10, 000, years, however, ice, melt, caused, world, sea, levels, to, rise, about, 35, m, 115, ft, in, the, early, part, of, the, holocene, and, another, 30, m, in, the, later, part, of, the, holocene, in, addition, many, areas, above, about, 40, degrees, north, latitude, had, been, depressed, by, the, weight, of, the, pleistocene, glaciers, and, rose, as, much, as, 180, m, 590, ft, due, to, post, glacial, rebound, over, the, late, pleistocene, and, holocene, and, are, still, rising, today, the, sea, level, rise, and, temporary, land, depression, allowed, temporary, marine, incursions, into, areas, that, are, now, far, from, the, sea, for, example, marine, fossils, from, the, holocene, epoch, have, been, found, in, locations, such, as, vermont, and, michigan, other, than, higher, latitude, temporary, marine, incursions, associated, with, glacial, depression, holocene, fossils, are, found, primarily, in, lakebed, floodplain, and, cave, deposits, holocene, marine, deposits, along, low, latitude, coastlines, are, rare, because, the, rise, in, sea, levels, during, the, period, exceeds, any, likely, tectonic, uplift, of, non, glacial, origin, post, glacial, rebound, in, the, scandinavia, region, resulted, in, a, shrinking, baltic, sea, the, region, continues, to, rise, still, causing, weak, earthquakes, across, northern, europe, an, equivalent, event, in, north, america, was, the, rebound, of, hudson, bay, as, it, shrank, from, its, larger, immediate, post, glacial, tyrrell, sea, phase, to, its, present, boundaries, the, climate, throughout, the, holocene, has, shown, significant, variability, despite, ice, core, records, from, greenland, suggesting, a, more, stable, climate, following, the, preceding, ice, age, marine, chemical, fluxes, during, the, holocene, were, lower, than, during, the, younger, dryas, but, were, still, considerable, enough, to, imply, notable, changes, in, the, climate, the, temporal, and, spatial, extent, of, climate, change, during, the, holocene, is, an, area, of, considerable, uncertainty, with, radiative, forcing, recently, proposed, to, be, the, origin, of, cycles, identified, in, the, north, atlantic, region, climate, cyclicity, through, the, holocene, bond, events, has, been, observed, in, or, near, marine, settings, and, is, strongly, controlled, by, glacial, input, to, the, north, atlantic, periodicities, of, 2500, 1500, and, 1000, years, are, generally, observed, in, the, north, atlantic, at, the, same, time, spectral, analyses, of, the, continental, record, which, is, remote, from, oceanic, influence, reveal, persistent, periodicities, of, 1, 000, and, 500, years, that, may, correspond, to, solar, activity, variations, during, the, holocene, epoch, a, 1, 500, year, cycle, corresponding, to, the, north, atlantic, oceanic, circulation, may, have, had, widespread, global, distribution, in, the, late, holocene, from, 8, 500, bp, to, 6, 700, bp, north, atlantic, climate, oscillations, were, highly, irregular, and, erratic, because, of, perturbations, from, substantial, ice, discharge, into, the, ocean, from, the, collapsing, laurentide, ice, sheet, the, greenland, ice, core, records, indicate, that, climate, changes, became, more, regional, and, had, a, larger, effect, on, the, mid, to, low, latitudes, and, mid, to, high, latitudes, after, 5600, b, p, human, activity, through, land, use, changes, was, an, important, influence, on, holocene, climatic, changes, and, is, believed, to, be, why, the, holocene, is, an, atypical, interglacial, that, has, not, experienced, significant, cooling, over, its, course, from, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, onwards, large, scale, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, caused, the, earth, to, warm, likewise, climatic, changes, have, induced, substantial, changes, in, human, civilisation, over, the, course, of, the, holocene, during, the, transition, from, the, last, glacial, to, the, holocene, the, huelmo, mascardi, cold, reversal, in, the, southern, hemisphere, began, before, the, younger, dryas, and, the, maximum, warmth, flowed, south, to, north, from, 11, 000, to, 7, 000, years, ago, it, appears, that, this, was, influenced, by, the, residual, glacial, ice, remaining, in, the, northern, hemisphere, until, the, later, date, the, first, major, phase, of, holocene, climate, was, the, preboreal, at, the, start, of, the, preboreal, occurred, the, preboreal, oscillation, pbo, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, hco, was, a, period, of, warming, throughout, the, globe, but, was, not, globally, synchronous, and, uniform, following, the, hco, the, global, climate, entered, a, broad, trend, of, very, gradual, cooling, known, as, neoglaciation, which, lasted, from, the, end, of, the, hco, to, before, the, industrial, revolution, from, the, 10th, 14th, century, the, climate, was, similar, to, that, of, modern, times, during, a, period, known, as, the, mediaeval, warm, period, mwp, also, known, as, the, mediaeval, climatic, optimum, mco, it, was, found, that, the, warming, that, is, taking, place, in, current, years, is, both, more, frequent, and, more, spatially, homogeneous, than, what, was, experienced, during, the, mwp, a, warming, of, 1, degree, celsius, occurs, 5, 40, times, more, frequently, in, modern, years, than, during, the, mwp, the, major, forcing, during, the, mwp, was, due, to, greater, solar, activity, which, led, to, heterogeneity, compared, to, the, greenhouse, gas, forcing, of, modern, years, that, leads, to, more, homogeneous, warming, this, was, followed, by, the, little, ice, age, lia, from, the, 13th, or, 14th, century, to, the, mid, 19th, century, the, lia, was, the, coldest, interval, of, time, of, the, past, two, millennia, following, the, industrial, revolution, warm, decadal, intervals, became, more, common, relative, to, before, as, a, consequence, of, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gases, resulting, in, progressive, global, warming, in, the, late, 20th, century, anthropogenic, forcing, superseded, solar, activity, as, the, dominant, driver, of, climate, change, though, solar, activity, has, continued, to, play, a, role, drangaj, kull, iceland, s, northernmost, glacier, melted, shortly, after, 9, 200, bp, in, northern, germany, the, middle, holocene, saw, a, drastic, increase, in, the, amount, of, raised, bogs, most, likely, related, to, sea, level, rise, although, human, activity, affected, geomorphology, and, landscape, evolution, in, northern, germany, throughout, the, holocene, it, only, became, a, dominant, influence, in, the, last, four, centuries, in, the, french, alps, geochemistry, and, lithium, isotope, signatures, in, lake, sediments, have, suggested, gradual, soil, formation, from, the, last, glacial, period, to, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, and, this, soil, development, was, altered, by, the, settlement, of, human, societies, early, anthropogenic, activities, such, as, deforestation, and, agriculture, reinforced, soil, erosion, which, peaked, in, the, middle, ages, at, an, unprecedented, level, marking, human, forcing, as, the, most, powerful, factor, affecting, surface, processes, the, sedimentary, record, from, aitoliko, lagoon, indicates, that, wet, winters, locally, predominated, from, 210, to, 160, bp, followed, by, dry, winter, dominance, from, 160, to, 20, bp, north, africa, dominated, by, the, sahara, desert, in, the, present, was, instead, a, savanna, dotted, with, large, lakes, during, the, early, and, middle, holocene, regionally, known, as, the, african, humid, period, ahp, the, northward, migration, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, produced, increased, monsoon, rainfall, over, north, africa, the, lush, vegetation, of, the, sahara, brought, an, increase, in, pastoralism, the, ahp, ended, around, 5, 500, bp, after, which, the, sahara, began, to, dry, and, become, the, desert, it, is, today, a, stronger, east, african, monsoon, during, the, middle, holocene, increased, precipitation, in, east, africa, and, raised, lake, levels, around, 800, ad, or, 1, 150, bp, a, marine, transgression, occurred, in, southeastern, africa, in, the, lake, lungu, basin, this, sea, level, highstand, occurred, from, 740, to, 910, ad, or, from, 1, 210, to, 1, 040, bp, as, evidenced, by, the, lake, s, connection, to, the, indian, ocean, at, this, time, this, transgression, was, followed, by, a, period, of, transition, that, lasted, until, 590, bp, when, the, region, experienced, significant, aridification, and, began, to, be, extensively, used, by, humans, for, livestock, herding, in, the, kalahari, desert, holocene, climate, was, overall, very, stable, and, environmental, change, was, of, low, amplitude, relatively, cool, conditions, have, prevailed, since, 4, 000, bp, during, the, late, holocene, the, coastline, of, the, levant, receded, westward, prompting, a, shift, in, human, settlement, patterns, following, this, marine, regression, central, asia, experienced, glacial, like, temperatures, until, about, 8, 000, bp, when, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, collapsed, in, xinjiang, long, term, holocene, warming, increased, meltwater, supply, during, summers, creating, large, lakes, and, oases, at, low, altitudes, and, inducing, enhanced, moisture, recycling, in, the, tien, shan, sedimentological, evidence, from, swan, lake, suggests, the, period, between, 8, 500, and, 6, 900, bp, was, relatively, warm, with, steppe, meadow, vegetation, being, predominant, an, increase, in, cyperaceae, from, 6, 900, to, 2, 600, bp, indicates, cooling, and, humidification, of, the, tian, shan, climate, that, was, interrupted, by, a, warm, period, between, 5, 500, and, 4, 500, bp, after, 2, 600, bp, an, alpine, steppe, climate, prevailed, across, the, region, sand, dune, evolution, in, the, bayanbulak, basin, shows, that, the, region, was, very, dry, from, the, holocene, s, beginning, until, around, 6, 500, bp, when, a, wet, interval, began, in, the, tibetan, plateau, the, moisture, optimum, spanned, from, around, 7, 500, to, 5, 500, bp, the, tarim, basin, records, the, onset, of, significant, aridification, around, 3, 000, 2, 000, bp, after, 11, 800, bp, and, especially, between, 10, 800, and, 9, 200, bp, ladakh, experienced, tremendous, moisture, increase, most, likely, related, to, the, strengthening, of, the, indian, summer, monsoon, ism, from, 9, 200, to, 6, 900, bp, relative, aridity, persisted, in, ladakh, a, second, major, humid, phase, occurred, in, ladakh, from, 6, 900, to, 4, 800, bp, after, which, the, region, was, again, arid, from, 900, to, 1, 200, ad, during, the, mwp, the, ism, was, again, strong, as, evidenced, by, low, 18, o, values, from, the, ganga, plain, the, sediments, of, lonar, lake, in, maharashtra, record, dry, conditions, around, 11, 400, bp, that, transitioned, into, a, much, wetter, climate, from, 11, 400, to, 11, 100, bp, due, to, intensification, of, the, ism, over, the, early, holocene, the, region, was, very, wet, but, during, the, middle, holocene, from, 6, 200, to, 3, 900, bp, aridification, occurred, with, the, subsequent, late, holocene, being, relatively, arid, as, a, whole, coastal, southwestern, india, experienced, a, stronger, ism, from, 9, 690, to, 7, 560, bp, during, the, hco, from, 3, 510, to, 2, 550, bp, during, the, late, holocene, the, ism, became, weaker, although, this, weakening, was, interrupted, by, an, interval, of, unusually, high, ism, strength, from, 3, 400, to, 3, 200, bp, southwestern, china, experienced, long, term, warming, during, the, early, holocene, up, until, 7, 000, bp, northern, china, experienced, an, abrupt, aridification, event, approximately, 4, 000, bp, from, around, 3, 500, to, 3, 000, bp, northeastern, china, underwent, a, prolonged, cooling, manifesting, itself, with, the, disruption, of, bronze, age, civilisations, in, the, region, eastern, and, southern, china, the, monsoonal, regions, of, china, were, wetter, than, present, in, the, early, and, middle, holocene, lake, huguangyan, s, toc, 13, c, wax, 13, c, org, 15, n, values, suggest, the, period, of, peak, moisture, lasted, from, 9, 200, to, 1, 800, bp, and, was, attributable, to, a, strong, east, asian, summer, monsoon, easm, late, holocene, cooling, events, in, the, region, were, dominantly, influenced, by, solar, forcing, with, many, individual, cold, snaps, linked, to, solar, minima, such, as, the, oort, wolf, sp, rer, and, maunder, minima, a, notable, cooling, event, in, southeastern, china, occurred, 3, 200, bp, strengthening, of, the, winter, monsoon, occurred, around, 5, 500, 4, 000, and, 2, 500, bp, monsoonal, regions, of, china, became, more, arid, in, the, late, holocene, before, 7, 500, bp, the, gulf, of, thailand, was, exposed, above, sea, level, and, was, very, arid, a, marine, transgression, occurred, from, 7, 500, to, 6, 200, bp, amidst, global, warming, during, the, middle, holocene, western, north, america, was, drier, than, present, with, wetter, winters, and, drier, summers, after, the, end, of, the, thermal, maximum, of, the, hco, around, 4, 500, bp, the, east, greenland, current, underwent, strengthening, a, massive, megadrought, occurred, from, 2, 800, to, 1, 850, bp, in, the, great, basin, eastern, north, america, underwent, abrupt, warming, and, humidification, around, 10, 500, bp, and, then, declined, from, 9, 300, to, 9, 100, bp, the, region, has, undergone, a, long, term, wettening, since, 5, 500, bp, occasionally, interrupted, by, intervals, of, high, aridity, a, major, cool, event, lasting, from, 5, 500, to, 4, 700, bp, was, coeval, with, a, major, humidification, before, being, terminated, by, a, major, drought, and, warming, at, the, end, of, that, interval, during, the, early, holocene, relative, sea, level, rose, in, the, bahia, region, causing, a, landward, expansion, of, mangroves, during, the, late, holocene, the, mangroves, declined, as, sea, level, dropped, and, freshwater, supply, increased, in, the, santa, catarina, region, the, maximum, sea, level, highstand, was, around, 2, 1, metres, above, present, and, occurred, about, 5, 800, to, 5, 000, bp, sea, levels, at, rocas, atoll, were, likewise, higher, than, present, for, much, of, the, late, holocene, the, northwest, australian, summer, monsoon, was, in, a, strong, phase, from, 8, 500, to, 6, 400, bp, from, 5, 000, to, 4, 000, bp, possibly, until, 3, 000, bp, and, from, 1, 300, to, 900, bp, with, weak, phases, in, between, and, the, current, weak, phase, beginning, around, 900, bp, after, the, end, of, the, last, strong, phase, ice, core, measurements, imply, that, the, sea, surface, temperature, sst, gradient, east, of, new, zealand, across, the, subtropical, front, stf, was, around, 2, degrees, celsius, during, the, hco, this, temperature, gradient, is, significantly, less, than, modern, times, which, is, around, 6, degrees, celsius, a, study, utilizing, five, sst, proxies, from, 37, s, to, 60, s, latitude, confirmed, that, the, strong, temperature, gradient, was, confined, to, the, area, immediately, south, of, the, stf, and, is, correlated, with, reduced, westerly, winds, near, new, zealand, since, 7, 100, bp, new, zealand, experienced, 53, cyclones, similar, in, magnitude, to, cyclone, bola, evidence, from, the, gal, pagos, islands, shows, that, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, was, significantly, weaker, during, the, middle, holocene, but, that, the, strength, of, enso, became, moderate, to, high, over, the, late, holocene, animal, and, plant, life, have, not, evolved, much, during, the, relatively, short, holocene, but, there, have, been, major, shifts, in, the, richness, and, abundance, of, plants, and, animals, a, number, of, large, animals, including, mammoths, and, mastodons, saber, toothed, cats, like, smilodon, and, homotherium, and, giant, sloths, went, extinct, in, the, late, pleistocene, and, early, holocene, these, extinctions, can, be, mostly, attributed, to, people, in, america, it, coincided, with, the, arrival, of, the, clovis, people, this, culture, was, known, for, clovis, points, which, were, fashioned, on, spears, for, hunting, animals, shrubs, herbs, and, mosses, had, also, changed, in, relative, abundance, from, the, pleistocene, to, holocene, identified, by, permafrost, core, samples, throughout, the, world, ecosystems, in, cooler, climates, that, were, previously, regional, have, been, isolated, in, higher, altitude, ecological, islands, the, 8, 2, ka, event, an, abrupt, cold, spell, recorded, as, a, negative, excursion, in, the, 18, o, record, lasting, 400, years, is, the, most, prominent, climatic, event, occurring, in, the, holocene, epoch, and, may, have, marked, a, resurgence, of, ice, cover, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, event, was, caused, by, the, final, drainage, of, lake, agassiz, which, had, been, confined, by, the, glaciers, disrupting, the, thermohaline, circulation, of, the, atlantic, this, disruption, was, the, result, of, an, ice, dam, over, hudson, bay, collapsing, sending, cold, lake, agassiz, water, into, the, north, atlantic, ocean, furthermore, studies, show, that, the, melting, of, lake, agassiz, led, to, sea, level, rise, which, flooded, the, north, american, coastal, landscape, the, basal, peat, plant, was, then, used, to, determine, the, resulting, local, sea, level, rise, of, 0, 20, 0, 56m, in, the, mississippi, delta, subsequent, research, however, suggested, that, the, discharge, was, probably, superimposed, upon, a, longer, episode, of, cooler, climate, lasting, up, to, 600, years, and, observed, that, the, extent, of, the, area, affected, was, unclear, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, corresponds, with, the, beginning, of, the, mesolithic, age, in, most, of, europe, in, regions, such, as, the, middle, east, and, anatolia, the, term, epipaleolithic, is, preferred, in, place, of, mesolithic, as, they, refer, to, approximately, the, same, time, period, cultures, in, this, period, include, hamburgian, federmesser, and, the, natufian, culture, during, which, the, oldest, inhabited, places, still, existing, on, earth, were, first, settled, such, as, tell, es, sultan, jericho, in, the, middle, east, there, is, also, evolving, archeological, evidence, of, proto, religion, at, locations, such, as, g, bekli, tepe, as, long, ago, as, the, 9th, millennium, bc, the, preceding, period, of, the, late, pleistocene, had, already, brought, advancements, such, as, the, bow, and, arrow, creating, more, efficient, forms, of, hunting, and, replacing, spear, throwers, in, the, holocene, however, the, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, allowed, humans, to, develop, villages, and, towns, in, centralized, locations, archaeological, data, shows, that, between, 10, 000, and, 7, 000, bp, rapid, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, took, place, in, tropical, and, subtropical, parts, of, asia, africa, and, central, america, the, development, of, farming, allowed, humans, to, transition, away, from, hunter, gatherer, nomadic, cultures, which, did, not, establish, permanent, settlements, to, a, more, sustainable, sedentary, lifestyle, this, form, of, lifestyle, change, allowed, humans, to, develop, towns, and, villages, in, centralized, locations, which, gave, rise, to, the, world, known, today, it, is, believed, that, the, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, began, in, the, early, part, of, the, holocene, in, the, tropical, areas, of, the, planet, because, these, areas, had, warm, moist, temperatures, the, climate, was, perfect, for, effective, farming, culture, development, and, human, population, change, specifically, in, south, america, has, also, been, linked, to, spikes, in, hydroclimate, resulting, in, climate, variability, in, the, mid, holocene, 8, 2, 4, 2, k, cal, bp, climate, change, on, seasonality, and, available, moisture, also, allowed, for, favorable, agricultural, conditions, which, promoted, human, development, for, maya, and, tiwanaku, regions, in, the, korean, peninsula, climatic, changes, fostered, a, population, boom, during, the, middle, chulmun, period, from, 5, 500, to, 5, 000, bp, but, contributed, to, a, subsequent, bust, during, the, late, and, final, chulmun, periods, from, 5, 000, to, 4, 000, bp, and, from, 4, 000, to, 3, 500, bp, respectively, the, holocene, extinction, otherwise, referred, to, as, the, sixth, mass, extinction, or, anthropocene, extinction, is, an, ongoing, extinction, event, of, species, during, the, present, holocene, epoch, with, the, more, recent, time, sometimes, called, anthropocene, as, a, result, of, human, activity, the, included, extinctions, span, numerous, families, of, fungi, plants, and, animals, including, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and, invertebrates, with, widespread, degradation, of, highly, biodiverse, habitats, such, as, coral, reefs, and, rainforests, as, well, as, other, areas, the, vast, majority, of, these, extinctions, are, thought, to, be, undocumented, as, the, species, are, undiscovered, at, the, time, of, their, extinction, or, no, one, has, yet, discovered, their, extinction, the, current, rate, of, extinction, of, species, is, estimated, at, 100, to, 1, 000, times, higher, than, natural, background, extinction, rates
