four, views, of, the, constellation, orion, a, constellation, is, an, area, on, the, celestial, sphere, in, which, a, group, of, visible, stars, forms, a, perceived, pattern, or, outline, typically, representing, an, animal, mythological, subject, or, inanimate, object, the, first, constellations, likely, go, back, to, prehistory, people, used, them, to, relate, stories, of, their, beliefs, experiences, creation, and, mythology, different, cultures, and, countries, invented, their, own, constellations, some, of, which, lasted, into, the, early, 20th, century, before, today, s, constellations, were, internationally, recognized, the, recognition, of, constellations, has, changed, significantly, over, time, many, changed, in, size, or, shape, some, became, popular, only, to, drop, into, obscurity, some, were, limited, to, a, single, culture, or, nation, naming, constellations, also, helped, astronomers, and, navigators, identify, stars, more, easily, twelve, or, thirteen, ancient, constellations, belong, to, the, zodiac, straddling, the, ecliptic, which, the, sun, moon, and, planets, all, traverse, the, origins, of, the, zodiac, remain, historically, uncertain, its, astrological, divisions, became, prominent, c, 400, bc, in, babylonian, or, chaldean, astronomy, constellations, appear, in, western, culture, via, greece, and, are, mentioned, in, the, works, of, hesiod, eudoxus, and, aratus, the, traditional, 48, constellations, consisting, of, the, zodiac, and, 36, more, now, 38, following, the, division, of, argo, navis, into, three, constellations, are, listed, by, ptolemy, a, greco, roman, astronomer, from, alexandria, egypt, in, his, almagest, the, formation, of, constellations, was, the, subject, of, extensive, mythology, most, notably, in, the, metamorphoses, of, the, latin, poet, ovid, constellations, in, the, far, southern, sky, were, added, from, the, 15th, century, until, the, mid, 18th, century, when, european, explorers, began, traveling, to, the, southern, hemisphere, due, to, roman, and, european, transmission, each, constellation, has, a, latin, name, in, 1922, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, formally, accepted, the, modern, list, of, 88, constellations, and, in, 1928, adopted, official, constellation, boundaries, that, together, cover, the, entire, celestial, sphere, any, given, point, in, a, celestial, coordinate, system, lies, in, one, of, the, modern, constellations, some, astronomical, naming, systems, include, the, constellation, where, a, given, celestial, object, is, found, to, convey, its, approximate, location, in, the, sky, the, flamsteed, designation, of, a, star, for, example, consists, of, a, number, and, the, genitive, form, of, the, constellation, s, name, other, star, patterns, or, groups, called, asterisms, are, not, constellations, under, the, formal, definition, but, are, also, used, by, observers, to, navigate, the, night, sky, asterisms, may, be, several, stars, within, a, constellation, or, they, may, share, stars, with, more, than, one, constellation, examples, of, asterisms, include, the, teapot, within, the, constellation, sagittarius, or, the, big, dipper, in, the, constellation, of, ursa, major, the, word, constellation, comes, from, the, late, latin, term, c, nstell, ti, which, can, be, translated, as, set, of, stars, it, came, into, use, in, middle, english, during, the, 14th, century, the, ancient, greek, word, for, constellation, is, astron, these, terms, historically, referred, to, any, recognisable, pattern, of, stars, whose, appearance, was, associated, with, mythological, characters, or, creatures, earthbound, animals, or, objects, over, time, among, european, astronomers, the, constellations, became, clearly, defined, and, widely, recognised, in, the, 20th, century, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, recognized, 88, constellations, a, constellation, or, star, that, never, sets, below, the, horizon, when, viewed, from, a, particular, latitude, on, earth, is, termed, circumpolar, from, the, north, pole, or, south, pole, all, constellations, south, or, north, of, the, celestial, equator, are, circumpolar, depending, on, the, definition, equatorial, constellations, may, include, those, that, lie, between, declinations, 45, north, and, 45, south, or, those, that, pass, through, the, declination, range, of, the, ecliptic, or, zodiac, ranging, between, 23, 5, north, and, 23, 5, south, stars, in, constellations, can, appear, near, each, other, in, the, sky, but, they, usually, lie, at, a, variety, of, distances, away, from, the, earth, since, each, star, has, its, own, independent, motion, all, constellations, will, change, slowly, over, time, after, tens, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, familiar, outlines, will, become, unrecognizable, astronomers, can, predict, the, past, or, future, constellation, outlines, by, measuring, common, proper, motions, of, individual, stars, by, accurate, astrometry, and, their, radial, velocities, by, astronomical, spectroscopy, the, 88, constellations, recognized, by, the, iau, as, well, as, those, by, cultures, throughout, history, are, imagined, figures, and, shapes, derived, from, the, patterns, of, stars, in, the, observable, sky, many, officially, recognized, constellations, are, based, on, the, imaginations, of, ancient, near, eastern, and, mediterranean, mythologies, some, of, these, stories, seem, to, relate, to, the, appearance, of, the, constellations, e, g, the, assassination, of, orion, by, scorpius, their, constellations, appearing, at, opposite, times, of, year, constellation, positions, change, throughout, the, year, due, to, night, on, earth, occurring, at, gradually, different, portions, of, its, orbit, around, the, sun, as, earth, rotates, toward, the, east, the, celestial, sphere, appears, to, rotate, west, with, stars, circling, counterclockwise, around, the, northern, pole, star, and, clockwise, around, the, southern, pole, star, because, of, earth, s, 23, 5, axial, tilt, the, zodiac, is, distributed, equally, across, hemispheres, along, the, ecliptic, approximating, a, great, circle, zodiacal, constellations, of, the, northern, sky, are, pisces, aries, taurus, gemini, cancer, and, leo, in, the, southern, sky, are, virgo, libra, scorpius, sagittarius, capricornus, and, aquarius, the, zodiac, appears, directly, overhead, from, latitudes, of, 23, 5, north, to, 23, 5, south, depending, on, the, time, of, year, in, summer, the, ecliptic, appears, higher, up, in, the, daytime, and, lower, at, night, while, in, winter, the, reverse, is, true, for, both, hemispheres, due, to, the, solar, system, s, 60, tilt, the, galactic, plane, of, the, milky, way, is, inclined, 60, from, the, ecliptic, between, taurus, and, gemini, north, and, scorpius, and, sagittarius, south, and, near, which, the, galactic, center, can, be, found, the, galaxy, appears, to, pass, through, aquila, near, the, celestial, equator, and, northern, constellations, cygnus, cassiopeia, perseus, auriga, and, orion, near, betelgeuse, as, well, as, monoceros, near, the, celestial, equator, and, southern, constellations, puppis, vela, carina, crux, centaurus, triangulum, australe, and, ara, polaris, being, the, north, star, is, the, approximate, center, of,

faint, in, the, night, sky, thus, the, pole, can, be, triangulated, using, the, constellation, crux, as, well, as, the, stars, alpha, and, beta, centauri, about, 30, counterclockwise, from, crux, of, the, constellation, centaurus, arching, over, crux, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, 17, 000, year, old, cave, paintings, in, lascaux, southern, france, depict, star, constellations, such, as, taurus, orion, s, belt, and, the, pleiades, however, this, view, is, not, generally, accepted, among, scientists, inscribed, stones, and, clay, writing, tablets, from, mesopotamia, in, modern, iraq, dating, to, 3000, bc, provide, the, earliest, generally, accepted, evidence, for, humankind, s, identification, of, constellations, it, seems, that, the, bulk, of, the, mesopotamian, constellations, were, created, within, a, relatively, short, interval, from, around, 1300, to, 1000, bc, mesopotamian, constellations, appeared, later, in, many, of, the, classical, greek, constellations, the, oldest, babylonian, catalogues, of, stars, and, constellations, date, back, to, the, beginning, of, the, middle, bronze, age, most, notably, the, three, stars, each, texts, and, the, mul, apin, an, expanded, and, revised, version, based, on, more, accurate, observation, from, around, 1000, bc, however, the, numerous, sumerian, names, in, these, catalogues, suggest, that, they, built, on, older, but, otherwise, unattested, sumerian, traditions, of, the, early, bronze, age, the, classical, zodiac, is, a, revision, of, neo, babylonian, constellations, from, the, 6th, century, bc, the, greeks, adopted, the, babylonian, constellations, in, the, 4th, century, bc, twenty, ptolemaic, constellations, are, from, the, ancient, near, east, another, ten, have, the, same, stars, but, different, names, biblical, scholar, e, w, bullinger, interpreted, some, of, the, creatures, mentioned, in, the, books, of, ezekiel, and, revelation, as, the, middle, signs, of, the, four, quarters, of, the, zodiac, with, the, lion, as, leo, the, bull, as, taurus, the, man, representing, aquarius, and, the, eagle, standing, in, for, scorpio, the, biblical, book, of, job, also, makes, reference, to, a, number, of, constellations, including, ayish, bier, chesil, fool, and, chimah, heap, job, 9, 9, 38, 31, 32, rendered, as, arcturus, orion, and, pleiades, by, the, kjv, but, ayish, the, bier, actually, corresponding, to, ursa, major, the, term, mazzaroth, translated, as, a, garland, of, crowns, is, a, hapax, legomenon, in, job, 38, 32, and, it, might, refer, to, the, zodiacal, constellations, there, is, only, limited, information, on, ancient, greek, constellations, with, some, fragmentary, evidence, being, found, in, the, works, and, days, of, the, greek, poet, hesiod, who, mentioned, the, heavenly, bodies, greek, astronomy, essentially, adopted, the, older, babylonian, system, in, the, hellenistic, era, first, introduced, to, greece, by, eudoxus, of, cnidus, in, the, 4th, century, bc, the, original, work, of, eudoxus, is, lost, but, it, survives, as, a, versification, by, aratus, dating, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, most, complete, existing, works, dealing, with, the, mythical, origins, of, the, constellations, are, by, the, hellenistic, writer, termed, pseudo, eratosthenes, and, an, early, roman, writer, styled, pseudo, hyginus, the, basis, of, western, astronomy, as, taught, during, late, antiquity, and, until, the, early, modern, period, is, the, almagest, by, ptolemy, written, in, the, 2nd, century, in, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, native, egyptian, tradition, of, anthropomorphic, figures, represented, the, planets, stars, and, various, constellations, some, of, these, were, combined, with, greek, and, babylonian, astronomical, systems, culminating, in, the, zodiac, of, dendera, it, remains, unclear, when, this, occurred, but, most, were, placed, during, the, roman, period, between, 2nd, to, 4th, centuries, ad, the, oldest, known, depiction, of, the, zodiac, showing, all, the, now, familiar, constellations, along, with, some, original, egyptian, constellations, decans, and, planets, ptolemy, s, almagest, remained, the, standard, definition, of, constellations, in, the, medieval, period, both, in, europe, and, in, islamic, astronomy, ancient, china, had, a, long, tradition, of, observing, celestial, phenomena, nonspecific, chinese, star, names, later, categorized, in, the, twenty, eight, mansions, have, been, found, on, oracle, bones, from, anyang, dating, back, to, the, middle, shang, dynasty, these, constellations, are, some, of, the, most, important, observations, of, chinese, sky, attested, from, the, 5th, century, bc, parallels, to, the, earliest, babylonian, sumerian, star, catalogues, suggest, that, the, ancient, chinese, system, did, not, arise, independently, three, schools, of, classical, chinese, astronomy, in, the, han, period, are, attributed, to, astronomers, of, the, earlier, warring, states, period, the, constellations, of, the, three, schools, were, conflated, into, a, single, system, by, chen, zhuo, an, astronomer, of, the, 3rd, century, three, kingdoms, period, chen, zhuo, s, work, has, been, lost, but, information, on, his, system, of, constellations, survives, in, tang, period, records, notably, by, qutan, xida, the, oldest, extant, chinese, star, chart, dates, to, that, period, and, was, preserved, as, part, of, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, native, chinese, astronomy, flourished, during, the, song, dynasty, and, during, the, yuan, dynasty, became, increasingly, influenced, by, medieval, islamic, astronomy, see, treatise, on, astrology, of, the, kaiyuan, era, as, maps, were, prepared, during, this, period, on, more, scientific, lines, they, were, considered, as, more, reliable, a, well, known, map, from, the, song, period, is, the, suzhou, astronomical, chart, which, was, prepared, with, carvings, of, stars, on, the, planisphere, of, the, chinese, sky, on, a, stone, plate, it, is, done, accurately, based, on, observations, and, it, shows, the, supernova, of, the, year, of, 1054, in, taurus, influenced, by, european, astronomy, during, the, late, ming, dynasty, charts, depicted, more, stars, but, retained, the, traditional, constellations, newly, observed, stars, were, incorporated, as, supplementary, to, old, constellations, in, the, southern, sky, which, did, not, depict, the, traditional, stars, recorded, by, ancient, chinese, astronomers, further, improvements, were, made, during, the, later, part, of, the, ming, dynasty, by, xu, guangqi, and, johann, adam, schall, von, bell, the, german, jesuit, and, was, recorded, in, chongzhen, lishu, calendrical, treatise, of, chongzhen, period, 1628, traditional, chinese, star, maps, incorporated, 23, new, constellations, with, 125, stars, of, the, southern, hemisphere, of, the, sky, based, on, the, knowledge, of, western, star, charts, with, this, improvement, the, chinese, sky, was, integrated, with, the, world, astronomy, historically, the, origins, of, the, constellations, of, the, northern, and, southern, skies, are, distinctly, different, most, northern, constellations, date, to, antiquity, with, names, based, mostly, on, classical, greek, legends, evidence, of, these, constellations, has, survived, in, the, form, of, star, charts, whose, oldest, representation, appears, on, the, statue, known, as, the, farnese, atlas, based, perhaps, on, the, star, catalogue, of, the, greek, astronomer, hipparchus, southern, constellations, are, more, modern, inventions, sometimes, as, substitutes, for, ancient, constellations, e, g, argo, navis, some, southern, constellations, had, long, names, that, were, shortened, to, more, usable, forms, e, g, musca, australis, became, simply, musca, some, of, the, early, constellations, were, never, universally, adopted, stars, were, often, grouped, into, constellations, differently, by, different, observers, and, the, arbitrary, constellation, boundaries, often, led, to, confusion, as, to, which, constellation, a, celestial, object, belonged, before, astronomers, delineated, precise, boundaries, starting, in, the, 19th, century, constellations, generally, appeared, as, ill, defined, regions, of, the, sky, today, they, now, follow, officially, accepted, designated, lines, of, right, ascension, and, declination, based, on, those, defined, by, benjamin, gould, in, epoch, 1875, 0, in, his, star, catalogue, uranometria, argentina, the, 1603, star, atlas, uranometria, of, johann, bayer, assigned, stars, to, individual, constellations, and, formalized, the, division, by, assigning, a, series, of, greek, and, latin, letters, to, the, stars, within, each, constellation, these, are, known, today, as, bayer, designations, subsequent, star, atlases, led, to, the, development, of, today, s, accepted, modern, constellations, the, southern, sky, below, about, 65, declination, was, only, partially, catalogued, by, ancient, babylonians, egyptians, greeks, chinese, and, persian, astronomers, of, the, north, the, knowledge, that, northern, and, southern, star, patterns, differed, goes, back, to, classical, writers, who, describe, for, example, the, african, circumnavigation, expedition, commissioned, by, egyptian, pharaoh, necho, ii, in, c, 600, bc, and, those, of, hanno, the, navigator, in, c, 500, bc, the, history, of, southern, constellations, is, not, straightforward, different, groupings, and, different, names, were, proposed, by, various, observers, some, reflecting, national, traditions, or, designed, to, promote, various, sponsors, southern, constellations, were, important, from, the, 14th, to, 16th, centuries, when, sailors, used, the, stars, for, celestial, navigation, italian, explorers, who, recorded, new, southern, constellations, include, andrea, corsali, antonio, pigafetta, and, amerigo, vespucci, many, of, the, 88, iau, recognized, constellations, in, this, region, first, appeared, on, celestial, globes, developed, in, the, late, 16th, century, by, petrus, plancius, based, mainly, on, observations, of, the, dutch, navigators, pieter, dirkszoon, keyser, and, frederick, de, houtman, these, became, widely, known, through, johann, bayer, s, star, atlas, uranometria, of, 1603, fourteen, more, were, created, in, 1763, by, the, french, astronomer, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, who, also, split, the, ancient, constellation, argo, navis, into, three, these, new, figures, appeared, in, his, star, catalogue, published, in, 1756, several, modern, proposals, have, not, survived, the, french, astronomers, pierre, lemonnier, and, joseph, lalande, for, example, proposed, constellations, that, were, once, popular, but, have, since, been, dropped, the, northern, constellation, quadrans, muralis, survived, into, the, 19th, century, when, its, name, was, attached, to, the, quadrantid, meteor, shower, but, is, now, divided, between, bo, tes, and, draco, a, list, of, 88, constellations, was, produced, for, the, iau, in, 1922, it, is, roughly, based, on, the, traditional, greek, constellations, listed, by, ptolemy, in, his, almagest, in, the, 2nd, century, and, aratus, work, phenomena, with, early, modern, modifications, and, additions, most, importantly, introducing, constellations, covering, the, parts, of, the, southern, sky, unknown, to, ptolemy, by, petrus, plancius, 1592, 1597, 98, and, 1613, johannes, hevelius, 1690, and, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, 1763, who, introduced, fourteen, new, constellations, lacaille, studied, the, stars, of, the, southern, hemisphere, from, 1751, until, 1752, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, when, he, was, said, to, have, observed, more, than, 10, 000, stars, using, a, refracting, telescope, with, an, aperture, of, 0, 5, inches, 13, mm, in, 1922, henry, norris, russell, produced, a, list, of, 88, constellations, with, three, letter, abbreviations, for, them, however, these, constellations, did, not, have, clear, borders, between, them, in, 1928, the, iau, formally, accepted, the, 88, modern, constellations, with, contiguous, boundaries, along, vertical, and, horizontal, lines, of, right, ascension, and, declination, developed, by, eugene, delporte, that, together, cover, the, entire, celestial, sphere, this, list, was, finally, published, in, 1930, where, possible, these, modern, constellations, usually, share, the, names, of, their, graeco, roman, predecessors, such, as, orion, leo, or, scorpius, the, aim, of, this, system, is, area, mapping, i, e, the, division, of, the, celestial, sphere, into, contiguous, fields, out, of, the, 88, modern, constellations, 36, lie, predominantly, in, the, northern, sky, and, the, other, 52, predominantly, in, the, southern, the, boundaries, developed, by, delporte, used, data, that, originated, back, to, epoch, b1875, 0, which, was, when, benjamin, a, gould, first, made, his, proposal, to, designate, boundaries, for, the, celestial, sphere, a, suggestion, on, which, delporte, based, his, work, the, consequence, of, this, early, date, is, that, because, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, borders, on, a, modern, star, map, such, as, epoch, j2000, are, already, somewhat, skewed, and, no, longer, perfectly, vertical, or, horizontal, this, effect, will, increase, over, the, years, and, centuries, to, come, the, constellations, have, no, official, symbols, though, those, of, the, ecliptic, may, take, the, signs, of, the, zodiac, symbols, for, the, other, modern, constellations, as, well, as, older, ones, that, still, occur, in, modern, nomenclature, have, occasionally, been, published, the, great, rift, a, series, of, dark, patches, in, the, milky, way, is, most, visible, in, the, southern, sky, some, cultures, have, discerned, shapes, in, these, patches, members, of, the, inca, civilization, identified, various, dark, areas, or, dark, nebulae, in, the, milky, way, as, animals, and, associated, their, appearance, with, the, seasonal, rains, australian, aboriginal, astronomy, also, describes, dark, cloud, constellations, the, most, famous, being, the, emu, in, the, sky, whose, head, is, formed, by, the, coalsack, a, dark, nebula, instead, of, the, stars, footnotes, citations
