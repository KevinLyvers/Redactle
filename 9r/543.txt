cast, iron, is, a, class, of, iron, carbon, alloys, with, a, carbon, content, of, more, than, 2, and, silicon, content, around, 1, 3, its, usefulness, derives, from, its, relatively, low, melting, temperature, the, alloying, elements, determine, the, form, in, which, its, carbon, appears, white, cast, iron, has, its, carbon, combined, into, an, iron, carbide, named, cementite, which, is, very, hard, but, brittle, as, it, allows, cracks, to, pass, straight, through, grey, cast, iron, has, graphite, flakes, which, deflect, a, passing, crack, and, initiate, countless, new, cracks, as, the, material, breaks, and, ductile, cast, iron, has, spherical, graphite, nodules, which, stop, the, crack, from, further, progressing, carbon, c, ranging, from, 1, 8, to, 4, wt, and, silicon, si, 1, 3, wt, are, the, main, alloying, elements, of, cast, iron, iron, alloys, with, lower, carbon, content, are, known, as, steel, cast, iron, tends, to, be, brittle, except, for, malleable, cast, irons, with, its, relatively, low, melting, point, good, fluidity, castability, excellent, machinability, resistance, to, deformation, and, wear, resistance, cast, irons, have, become, an, engineering, material, with, a, wide, range, of, applications, and, are, used, in, pipes, machines, and, automotive, industry, parts, such, as, cylinder, heads, cylinder, blocks, and, gearbox, cases, some, alloys, are, resistant, to, damage, by, oxidation, in, general, cast, iron, is, notoriously, difficult, to, weld, the, earliest, cast, iron, artefacts, date, to, the, 5th, century, bc, and, were, discovered, by, archaeologists, in, what, is, now, jiangsu, china, cast, iron, was, used, in, ancient, china, for, warfare, agriculture, and, architecture, during, the, 15th, century, ad, cast, iron, became, utilized, for, cannon, in, burgundy, france, and, in, england, during, the, reformation, the, amounts, of, cast, iron, used, for, cannons, required, large, scale, production, the, first, cast, iron, bridge, was, built, during, the, 1770s, by, abraham, darby, iii, and, is, known, as, the, iron, bridge, in, shropshire, england, cast, iron, was, also, used, in, the, construction, of, buildings, cast, iron, is, made, from, pig, iron, which, is, the, product, of, melting, iron, ore, in, a, blast, furnace, cast, iron, can, be, made, directly, from, the, molten, pig, iron, or, by, re, melting, pig, iron, often, along, with, substantial, quantities, of, iron, steel, limestone, carbon, coke, and, taking, various, steps, to, remove, undesirable, contaminants, phosphorus, and, sulfur, may, be, burnt, out, of, the, molten, iron, but, this, also, burns, out, the, carbon, which, must, be, replaced, depending, on, the, application, carbon, and, silicon, content, are, adjusted, to, the, desired, levels, which, may, be, anywhere, from, 2, 3, 5, and, 1, 3, respectively, if, desired, other, elements, are, then, added, to, the, melt, before, the, final, form, is, produced, by, casting, cast, iron, is, sometimes, melted, in, a, special, type, of, blast, furnace, known, as, a, cupola, but, in, modern, applications, it, is, more, often, melted, in, electric, induction, furnaces, or, electric, arc, furnaces, after, melting, is, complete, the, molten, cast, iron, is, poured, into, a, holding, furnace, or, ladle, cast, iron, s, properties, are, changed, by, adding, various, alloying, elements, or, alloyants, next, to, carbon, silicon, is, the, most, important, alloyant, because, it, forces, carbon, out, of, solution, a, low, percentage, of, silicon, allows, carbon, to, remain, in, solution, forming, iron, carbide, and, producing, white, cast, iron, a, high, percentage, of, silicon, forces, carbon, out, of, solution, forming, graphite, and, producing, grey, cast, iron, other, alloying, agents, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and, vanadium, counteract, silicon, and, promote, the, retention, of, carbon, and, the, formation, of, those, carbides, nickel, and, copper, increase, strength, and, machinability, but, do, not, change, the, amount, of, graphite, formed, carbon, as, graphite, produces, a, softer, iron, reduces, shrinkage, lowers, strength, and, decreases, density, sulfur, largely, a, contaminant, when, present, forms, iron, sulfide, which, prevents, the, formation, of, graphite, and, increases, hardness, sulfur, makes, molten, cast, iron, viscous, which, causes, defects, to, counter, the, effects, of, sulfur, manganese, is, added, because, the, two, form, into, manganese, sulfide, instead, of, iron, sulfide, the, manganese, sulfide, is, lighter, than, the, melt, so, it, tends, to, float, out, of, the, melt, and, into, the, slag, the, amount, of, manganese, required, to, neutralize, sulfur, is, 1, 7, sulfur, content, 0, 3, if, more, than, this, amount, of, manganese, is, added, then, manganese, carbide, forms, which, increases, hardness, and, chilling, except, in, grey, iron, where, up, to, 1, of, manganese, increases, strength, and, density, nickel, is, one, of, the, most, common, alloying, elements, because, it, refines, the, pearlite, and, graphite, structures, improves, toughness, and, evens, out, hardness, differences, between, section, thicknesses, chromium, is, added, in, small, amounts, to, reduce, free, graphite, produce, chill, and, because, it, is, a, powerful, carbide, stabilizer, nickel, is, often, added, in, conjunction, a, small, amount, of, tin, can, be, added, as, a, substitute, for, 0, 5, chromium, copper, is, added, in, the, ladle, or, in, the, furnace, on, the, order, of, 0, 5, 2, 5, to, decrease, chill, refine, graphite, and, increase, fluidity, molybdenum, is, added, on, the, order, of, 0, 3, 1, to, increase, chill, and, refine, the, graphite, and, pearlite, structure, it, is, often, added, in, conjunction, with, nickel, copper, and, chromium, to, form, high, strength, irons, titanium, is, added, as, a, degasser, and, deoxidizer, but, it, also, increases, fluidity, vanadium, at, 0, 15, 0, 5, is, added, to, cast, iron, to, stabilize, cementite, increase, hardness, and, increase, resistance, to, wear, and, heat, zirconium, at, 0, 1, 0, 3, helps, to, form, graphite, deoxidize, and, increase, fluidity, in, malleable, iron, melts, bismuth, is, added, at, 0, 002, 0, 01, to, increase, how, much, silicon, can, be, added, in, white, iron, boron, is, added, to, aid, in, the, production, of, malleable, iron, it, also, reduces, the, coarsening, effect, of, bismuth, grey, cast, iron, is, characterised, by, its, graphitic, microstructure, which, causes, fractures, of, the, material, to, have, a, grey, appearance, it, is, the, most, commonly, used, cast, iron, and, the, most, widely, used, cast, material, based, on, weight, most, cast, irons, have, a, chemical, composition, of, 2, 5, 4, 0, carbon, 1, 3, silicon, and, the, remainder, iron, grey, cast, iron, has, less, tensile, strength, and, shock, resistance, than, steel, but, its, compressive, strength, is, comparable, to, low, and, medium, carbon, steel, these, mechanical, properties, are, controlled, by, the, size, and, shape, of, the, graphite, flakes, present, in, the, microstructure, and, can, be, characterised, according, to, the, guidelines, given, by, the, astm, white, cast, iron, displays, white, fractured, surfaces, due, to, the, presence, of, an, iron, carbide, precipitate, called, cementite, with, a, lower, silicon, content, graphitizing, agent, and, faster, cooling, rate, the, carbon, in, white, cast, iron, precipitates, out, of, the, melt, as, the, metastable, phase, cementite, fe, 3, c, rather, than, graphite, the, cementite, which, precipitates, from, the, melt, forms, as, relatively, large, particles, as, the, iron, carbide, precipitates, out, it, withdraws, carbon, from, the, original, melt, moving, the, mixture, toward, one, that, is, closer, to, eutectic, and, the, remaining, phase, is, the, lower, iron, carbon, austenite, which, on, cooling, might, transform, to, martensite, these, eutectic, carbides, are, much, too, large, to, provide, the, benefit, of, what, is, called, precipitation, hardening, as, in, some, steels, where, much, smaller, cementite, precipitates, might, inhibit, by, impeding, the, movement, of, dislocations, through, the, pure, iron, ferrite, matrix, rather, they, increase, the, bulk, hardness, of, the, cast, iron, simply, by, virtue, of, their, own, very, high, hardness, and, their, substantial, volume, fraction, such, that, the, bulk, hardness, can, be, approximated, by, a, rule, of, mixtures, in, any, case, they, offer, hardness, at, the, expense, of, toughness, since, carbide, makes, up, a, large, fraction, of, the, material, white, cast, iron, could, reasonably, be, classified, as, a, cermet, white, iron, is, too, brittle, for, use, in, many, structural, components, but, with, good, hardness, and, abrasion, resistance, and, relatively, low, cost, it, finds, use, in, such, applications, as, the, wear, surfaces, impeller, and, volute, of, slurry, pumps, shell, liners, and, lifter, bars, in, ball, mills, and, autogenous, grinding, mills, balls, and, rings, in, coal, pulverisers, it, is, difficult, to, cool, thick, castings, fast, enough, to, solidify, the, melt, as, white, cast, iron, all, the, way, through, however, rapid, cooling, can, be, used, to, solidify, a, shell, of, white, cast, iron, after, which, the, remainder, cools, more, slowly, to, form, a, core, of, grey, cast, iron, the, resulting, casting, called, a, chilled, casting, has, the, benefits, of, a, hard, surface, with, a, somewhat, tougher, interior, high, chromium, white, iron, alloys, allow, massive, castings, for, example, a, 10, tonne, impeller, to, be, sand, cast, as, the, chromium, reduces, cooling, rate, required, to, produce, carbides, through, the, greater, thicknesses, of, material, chromium, also, produces, carbides, with, impressive, abrasion, resistance, these, high, chromium, alloys, attribute, their, superior, hardness, to, the, presence, of, chromium, carbides, the, main, form, of, these, carbides, are, the, eutectic, or, primary, m, 7, c, 3, carbides, where, m, represents, iron, or, chromium, and, can, vary, depending, on, the, alloy, s, composition, the, eutectic, carbides, form, as, bundles, of, hollow, hexagonal, rods, and, grow, perpendicular, to, the, hexagonal, basal, plane, the, hardness, of, these, carbides, are, within, the, range, of, 1500, 1800hv, malleable, iron, starts, as, a, white, iron, casting, that, is, then, heat, treated, for, a, day, or, two, at, about, 950, c, 1, 740, f, and, then, cooled, over, a, day, or, two, as, a, result, the, carbon, in, iron, carbide, transforms, into, graphite, and, ferrite, plus, carbon, the, slow, process, allows, the, surface, tension, to, form, the, graphite, into, spheroidal, particles, rather, than, flakes, due, to, their, lower, aspect, ratio, the, spheroids, are, relatively, short, and, far, from, one, another, and, have, a, lower, cross, section, vis, a, vis, a, propagating, crack, or, phonon, they, also, have, blunt, boundaries, as, opposed, to, flakes, which, alleviates, the, stress, concentration, problems, found, in, grey, cast, iron, in, general, the, properties, of, malleable, cast, iron, are, more, like, those, of, mild, steel, there, is, a, limit, to, how, large, a, part, can, be, cast, in, malleable, iron, as, it, is, made, from, white, cast, iron, developed, in, 1948, nodular, or, ductile, cast, iron, has, its, graphite, in, the, form, of, very, tiny, nodules, with, the, graphite, in, the, form, of, concentric, layers, forming, the, nodules, as, a, result, the, properties, of, ductile, cast, iron, are, that, of, a, spongy, steel, without, the, stress, concentration, effects, that, flakes, of, graphite, would, produce, the, carbon, percentage, present, is, 3, 4, and, percentage, of, silicon, is, 1, 8, 2, 8, tiny, amounts, of, 0, 02, to, 0, 1, magnesium, and, only, 0, 02, to, 0, 04, cerium, added, to, these, alloys, slow, the, growth, of, graphite, precipitates, by, bonding, to, the, edges, of, the, graphite, planes, along, with, careful, control, of, other, elements, and, timing, this, allows, the, carbon, to, separate, as, spheroidal, particles, as, the, material, solidifies, the, properties, are, similar, to, malleable, iron, but, parts, can, be, cast, with, larger, sections, cast, iron, and, wrought, iron, can, be, produced, unintentionally, when, smelting, copper, using, iron, ore, as, a, flux, 47, 48, the, earliest, cast, iron, artifacts, date, to, the, 5th, century, bc, and, were, discovered, by, archaeologists, in, what, is, now, modern, luhe, county, jiangsu, in, china, during, the, warring, states, period, this, is, based, on, an, analysis, of, the, artifact, s, microstructures, because, cast, iron, is, comparatively, brittle, it, is, not, suitable, for, purposes, where, a, sharp, edge, or, flexibility, is, required, it, is, strong, under, compression, but, not, under, tension, cast, iron, was, invented, in, china, in, the, 5th, century, bc, and, poured, into, molds, to, make, ploughshares, and, pots, as, well, as, weapons, and, pagodas, although, steel, was, more, desirable, cast, iron, was, cheaper, and, thus, was, more, commonly, used, for, implements, in, ancient, china, while, wrought, iron, or, steel, was, used, for, weapons, the, chinese, developed, a, method, of, annealing, cast, iron, by, keeping, hot, castings, in, an, oxidizing, atmosphere, for, a, week, or, longer, in, order, to, burn, off, some, carbon, near, the, surface, in, order, to, keep, the, surface, layer, from, being, too, brittle, 43, deep, within, the, congo, region, of, the, central, african, forest, blacksmiths, invented, sophisticated, furnaces, capable, of, high, temperatures, over, 1000, years, ago, there, are, countless, examples, of, welding, soldering, and, cast, iron, created, in, crucibles, and, poured, into, molds, these, techniques, were, employed, for, the, use, of, composite, tools, and, weapons, with, cast, iron, or, steel, blades, and, soft, flexible, wrought, iron, interiors, iron, wire, was, also, produced, numerous, testimonies, were, made, by, early, european, missionaries, of, the, luba, people, pouring, cast, iron, into, molds, to, make, hoes, these, technological, innovations, were, accomplished, without, the, invention, of, the, blast, furnace, which, was, the, prerequisite, for, the, deployment, of, such, innovations, in, europe, and, asia, the, technology, of, cast, iron, was, transferred, to, the, west, from, china, al, qazvini, in, the, 13th, century, and, other, travellers, subsequently, noted, an, iron, industry, in, the, alburz, mountains, to, the, south, of, the, caspian, sea, this, is, close, to, the, silk, route, so, that, the, use, of, technology, derived, from, china, is, conceivable, upon, its, introduction, to, the, west, in, the, 15th, century, it, was, used, for, cannon, and, shot, henry, viii, reigned, 1509, 1547, initiated, the, casting, of, cannon, in, england, soon, english, iron, workers, using, blast, furnaces, developed, the, technique, of, producing, cast, iron, cannons, which, while, heavier, than, the, prevailing, bronze, cannons, were, much, cheaper, and, enabled, england, to, arm, her, navy, better, cast, iron, pots, were, made, at, many, english, blast, furnaces, at, the, time, in, 1707, abraham, darby, patented, a, new, method, of, making, pots, and, kettles, thinner, and, hence, cheaper, than, those, made, by, traditional, methods, this, meant, that, his, coalbrookdale, furnaces, became, dominant, as, suppliers, of, pots, an, activity, in, which, they, were, joined, in, the, 1720s, and, 1730s, by, a, small, number, of, other, coke, fired, blast, furnaces, application, of, the, steam, engine, to, power, blast, bellows, indirectly, by, pumping, water, to, a, waterwheel, in, britain, beginning, in, 1743, and, increasing, in, the, 1750s, was, a, key, factor, in, increasing, the, production, of, cast, iron, which, surged, in, the, following, decades, in, addition, to, overcoming, the, limitation, on, water, power, the, steam, pumped, water, powered, blast, gave, higher, furnace, temperatures, which, allowed, the, use, of, higher, lime, ratios, enabling, the, conversion, from, charcoal, supplies, of, wood, for, which, were, inadequate, to, coke, 122, the, ironmasters, of, the, weald, continued, producing, cast, irons, until, the, 1760s, and, armament, was, one, of, the, main, uses, of, irons, after, the, restoration, the, use, of, cast, iron, for, structural, purposes, began, in, the, late, 1770s, when, abraham, darby, iii, built, the, iron, bridge, although, short, beams, had, already, been, used, such, as, in, the, blast, furnaces, at, coalbrookdale, other, inventions, followed, including, one, patented, by, thomas, paine, cast, iron, bridges, became, commonplace, as, the, industrial, revolution, gathered, pace, thomas, telford, adopted, the, material, for, his, bridge, upstream, at, buildwas, and, then, for, longdon, on, tern, aqueduct, a, canal, trough, aqueduct, at, longdon, on, tern, on, the, shrewsbury, canal, it, was, followed, by, the, chirk, aqueduct, and, the, pontcysyllte, aqueduct, both, of, which, remain, in, use, following, the, recent, restorations, the, best, way, of, using, cast, iron, for, bridge, construction, was, by, using, arches, so, that, all, the, material, is, in, compression, cast, iron, again, like, masonry, is, very, strong, in, compression, wrought, iron, like, most, other, kinds, of, iron, and, indeed, like, most, metals, in, general, is, strong, in, tension, and, also, tough, resistant, to, fracturing, the, relationship, between, wrought, iron, and, cast, iron, for, structural, purposes, may, be, thought, of, as, analogous, to, the, relationship, between, wood, and, stone, cast, iron, beam, bridges, were, used, widely, by, the, early, railways, such, as, the, water, street, bridge, in, 1830, at, the, manchester, terminus, of, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, but, problems, with, its, use, became, all, too, apparent, when, a, new, bridge, carrying, the, chester, and, holyhead, railway, across, the, river, dee, in, chester, collapsed, killing, five, people, in, may, 1847, less, than, a, year, after, it, was, opened, the, dee, bridge, disaster, was, caused, by, excessive, loading, at, the, centre, of, the, beam, by, a, passing, train, and, many, similar, bridges, had, to, be, demolished, and, rebuilt, often, in, wrought, iron, the, bridge, had, been, badly, designed, being, trussed, with, wrought, iron, straps, which, were, wrongly, thought, to, reinforce, the, structure, the, centres, of, the, beams, were, put, into, bending, with, the, lower, edge, in, tension, where, cast, iron, like, masonry, is, very, weak, nevertheless, cast, iron, continued, to, be, used, in, inappropriate, structural, ways, until, the, tay, rail, bridge, disaster, of, 1879, cast, serious, doubt, on, the, use, of, the, material, crucial, lugs, for, holding, tie, bars, and, struts, in, the, tay, bridge, had, been, cast, integral, with, the, columns, and, they, failed, in, the, early, stages, of, the, accident, in, addition, the, bolt, holes, were, also, cast, and, not, drilled, thus, because, of, casting, s, draft, angle, the, tension, from, the, tie, bars, was, placed, on, the, hole, s, edge, rather, than, being, spread, over, the, length, of, the, hole, the, replacement, bridge, was, built, in, wrought, iron, and, steel, further, bridge, collapses, occurred, however, culminating, in, the, norwood, junction, rail, accident, of, 1891, thousands, of, cast, iron, rail, underbridges, were, eventually, replaced, by, steel, equivalents, by, 1900, owing, to, the, widespread, concern, about, cast, iron, under, bridges, on, the, rail, network, in, britain, cast, iron, columns, pioneered, in, mill, buildings, enabled, architects, to, build, multi, storey, buildings, without, the, enormously, thick, walls, required, for, masonry, buildings, of, any, height, they, also, opened, up, floor, spaces, in, factories, and, sight, lines, in, churches, and, auditoriums, by, the, mid, 19th, century, cast, iron, columns, were, common, in, warehouse, and, industrial, buildings, combined, with, wrought, or, cast, iron, beams, eventually, leading, to, the, development, of, steel, framed, skyscrapers, cast, iron, was, also, used, sometimes, for, decorative, facades, especially, in, the, united, states, and, the, soho, district, of, new, york, has, numerous, examples, it, was, also, used, occasionally, for, complete, prefabricated, buildings, such, as, the, historic, iron, building, in, watervliet, new, york, another, important, use, was, in, textile, mills, the, air, in, the, mills, contained, flammable, fibres, from, the, cotton, hemp, or, wool, being, spun, as, a, result, textile, mills, had, an, alarming, propensity, to, burn, down, the, solution, was, to, build, them, completely, of, non, combustible, materials, and, it, was, found, convenient, to, provide, the, building, with, an, iron, frame, largely, of, cast, iron, replacing, flammable, wood, the, first, such, building, was, at, ditherington, in, shrewsbury, shropshire, many, other, warehouses, were, built, using, cast, iron, columns, and, beams, although, faulty, designs, flawed, beams, or, overloading, sometimes, caused, building, collapses, and, structural, failures, during, the, industrial, revolution, cast, iron, was, also, widely, used, for, frame, and, other, fixed, parts, of, machinery, including, spinning, and, later, weaving, machines, in, textile, mills, cast, iron, became, widely, used, and, many, towns, had, foundries, producing, industrial, and, agricultural, machinery
