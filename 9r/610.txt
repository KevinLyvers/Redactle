geodesy, or, geodetics, is, the, science, of, measuring, and, representing, the, geometry, gravity, and, spatial, orientation, of, the, earth, in, temporally, varying, 3d, it, is, called, planetary, geodesy, when, studying, other, astronomical, bodies, such, as, planets, or, circumplanetary, systems, geodesy, is, an, earth, science, and, many, consider, the, study, of, earth, s, shape, and, gravity, to, be, central, to, that, science, it, is, also, a, discipline, of, applied, mathematics, geodynamical, phenomena, including, crustal, motion, tides, and, polar, motion, can, be, studied, by, designing, global, and, national, control, networks, applying, space, geodesy, and, terrestrial, geodetic, techniques, and, relying, on, datums, and, coordinate, systems, geodetic, job, titles, include, geodesist, and, geodetic, surveyor, geodesy, began, in, pre, scientific, antiquity, so, the, very, word, geodesy, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, or, geodaisia, literally, division, of, earth, early, ideas, about, the, figure, of, the, earth, held, the, earth, to, be, flat, and, the, heavens, a, physical, dome, spanning, over, it, two, early, arguments, for, a, spherical, earth, were, that, lunar, eclipses, appear, to, an, observer, as, circular, shadows, and, that, polaris, appears, lower, and, lower, in, the, sky, to, a, traveler, headed, south, in, english, geodesy, refers, to, the, science, of, measuring, and, representing, geospatial, information, while, geomatics, encompasses, practical, applications, of, geodesy, on, local, and, regional, scales, including, surveying, in, german, geodesy, can, refer, to, either, higher, geodesy, h, here, geod, sie, or, erdmessung, literally, geomensuration, concerned, with, measuring, earth, on, the, global, scale, or, engineering, geodesy, ingenieurgeod, sie, that, includes, surveying, measuring, parts, or, regions, of, earth, for, the, longest, time, geodesy, was, the, science, of, measuring, and, understanding, earth, s, geometric, shape, orientation, in, space, and, gravitational, field, however, geodetic, science, and, operations, are, applied, to, other, astronomical, bodies, in, our, solar, system, also, to, a, large, extent, earth, s, shape, is, the, result, of, rotation, which, causes, its, equatorial, bulge, and, the, competition, of, geological, processes, such, as, the, collision, of, plates, as, well, as, of, volcanism, resisted, by, earth, s, gravitational, field, this, applies, to, the, solid, surface, the, liquid, surface, dynamic, sea, surface, topography, and, earth, s, atmosphere, for, this, reason, the, study, of, earth, s, gravitational, field, is, called, physical, geodesy, the, geoid, essentially, is, the, figure, of, earth, abstracted, from, its, topographical, features, it, is, an, idealized, equilibrium, surface, of, seawater, the, mean, sea, level, surface, in, the, absence, of, currents, and, air, pressure, variations, and, continued, under, the, continental, masses, unlike, a, reference, ellipsoid, the, geoid, is, irregular, and, too, complicated, to, serve, as, the, computational, surface, for, solving, geometrical, problems, like, point, positioning, the, geometrical, separation, between, the, geoid, and, a, reference, ellipsoid, is, called, geoidal, undulation, and, it, varies, globally, between, 110, m, based, on, the, grs, 80, ellipsoid, a, reference, ellipsoid, customarily, chosen, to, be, the, same, size, volume, as, the, geoid, is, described, by, its, semi, major, axis, equatorial, radius, a, and, flattening, f, the, quantity, f, a, b, a, where, b, is, the, semi, minor, axis, polar, radius, is, purely, geometrical, the, mechanical, ellipticity, of, earth, dynamical, flattening, symbol, j, 2, can, be, determined, to, high, precision, by, observation, of, satellite, orbit, perturbations, its, relationship, with, geometrical, flattening, is, indirect, and, depends, on, the, internal, density, distribution, or, in, simplest, terms, the, degree, of, central, concentration, of, mass, the, 1980, geodetic, reference, system, grs, 80, adopted, at, the, xvii, general, assembly, of, the, international, union, of, geodesy, and, geophysics, iugg, posited, a, 6, 378, 137, m, semi, major, axis, and, a, 1, 298, 257, flattening, grs, 80, essentially, constitutes, the, basis, for, geodetic, positioning, by, the, global, positioning, system, gps, and, is, thus, also, in, widespread, use, outside, the, geodetic, community, numerous, systems, used, for, mapping, and, charting, are, becoming, obsolete, as, countries, increasingly, move, to, global, geocentric, reference, systems, utilizing, the, grs, 80, reference, ellipsoid, the, geoid, is, a, realizable, surface, meaning, it, can, be, consistently, located, on, earth, by, suitable, simple, measurements, from, physical, objects, like, a, tide, gauge, the, geoid, can, therefore, be, considered, a, physical, real, surface, the, reference, ellipsoid, however, has, many, possible, instantiations, and, is, not, readily, realizable, so, it, is, an, abstract, surface, the, third, primary, surface, of, geodetic, interest, the, topographic, surface, of, earth, is, also, realizable, the, locations, of, points, in, 3d, space, most, conveniently, are, described, by, three, cartesian, or, rectangular, coordinates, x, y, and, z, since, the, advent, of, satellite, positioning, such, coordinate, systems, are, typically, geocentric, with, the, z, axis, aligned, to, earth, s, conventional, or, instantaneous, rotation, axis, before, the, era, of, satellite, geodesy, the, coordinate, systems, associated, with, a, geodetic, datum, attempted, to, be, geocentric, but, with, the, origin, differing, from, the, geocenter, by, hundreds, of, meters, due, to, regional, deviations, in, the, direction, of, the, plumbline, vertical, these, regional, geodetic, datums, such, as, ed, 50, european, datum, 1950, or, nad, 27, north, american, datum, 1927, have, ellipsoids, associated, with, them, that, are, regional, best, fits, to, the, geoids, within, their, areas, of, validity, minimizing, the, deflections, of, the, vertical, over, these, areas, it, is, only, because, gps, satellites, orbit, about, the, geocenter, that, this, point, becomes, naturally, the, origin, of, a, coordinate, system, defined, by, satellite, geodetic, means, as, the, satellite, positions, in, space, themselves, get, computed, within, such, a, system, geocentric, coordinate, systems, used, in, geodesy, can, be, divided, naturally, into, two, classes, the, coordinate, transformation, between, these, two, systems, to, good, approximation, is, described, by, apparent, sidereal, time, which, accounts, for, variations, in, earth, s, axial, rotation, length, of, day, variations, a, more, accurate, description, also, accounts, for, polar, motion, as, a, phenomenon, closely, monitored, by, geodesists, in, geodetic, applications, like, surveying, and, mapping, two, general, types, of, coordinate, systems, in, the, plane, are, in, use, one, can, intuitively, use, rectangular, coordinates, in, the, plane, for, one, s, current, location, in, which, case, the, x, axis, will, point, to, the, local, north, more, formally, such, coordinates, can, be, obtained, from, 3d, coordinates, using, the, artifice, of, a, map, projection, it, is, impossible, to, map, the, curved, surface, of, earth, onto, a, flat, map, surface, without, deformation, the, compromise, most, often, chosen, called, a, conformal, projection, preserves, angles, and, length, ratios, so, that, small, circles, get, mapped, as, small, circles, and, small, squares, as, squares, an, example, of, such, a, projection, is, utm, universal, transverse, mercator, within, the, map, plane, we, have, rectangular, coordinates, x, and, y, in, this, case, the, north, direction, used, for, reference, is, the, map, north, not, the, local, north, the, difference, between, the, two, is, called, meridian, convergence, it, is, easy, enough, to, translate, between, polar, and, rectangular, coordinates, in, the, plane, let, as, above, direction, and, distance, be, and, s, respectively, then, we, have, the, reverse, transformation, is, given, by, in, geodesy, point, or, terrain, heights, are, above, sea, level, as, an, irregular, physically, defined, surface, height, systems, in, use, are, each, system, has, its, advantages, and, disadvantages, both, orthometric, and, normal, heights, are, expressed, in, metres, above, sea, level, whereas, geopotential, numbers, are, measures, of, potential, energy, unit, m, 2, s, 2, and, not, metric, the, reference, surface, is, the, geoid, an, equigeopotential, surface, approximating, the, mean, sea, level, as, described, above, for, normal, heights, the, reference, surface, is, the, so, called, quasi, geoid, which, has, a, few, metre, separation, from, the, geoid, due, to, the, density, assumption, in, its, continuation, under, the, continental, masses, one, can, relate, these, heights, through, the, geoid, undulation, concept, to, ellipsoidal, heights, also, known, as, geodetic, heights, representing, the, height, of, a, point, above, the, reference, ellipsoid, satellite, positioning, receivers, typically, provide, ellipsoidal, heights, unless, fitted, with, special, conversion, software, based, on, a, model, of, the, geoid, because, coordinates, and, heights, of, geodetic, points, always, get, obtained, within, a, system, that, itself, was, constructed, based, on, real, world, observations, geodesists, introduced, the, concept, of, a, geodetic, datum, plural, datums, a, physical, real, world, realization, of, a, coordinate, system, used, for, describing, point, locations, this, realization, follows, from, choosing, therefore, conventional, coordinate, values, for, one, or, more, datum, points, in, the, case, of, height, data, it, suffices, to, choose, one, datum, point, the, reference, benchmark, typically, a, tide, gauge, at, the, shore, thus, we, have, vertical, datums, such, as, the, navd, 88, north, american, vertical, datum, 1988, nap, normaal, amsterdams, peil, the, kronstadt, datum, the, trieste, datum, and, numerous, others, in, both, mathematics, and, geodesy, a, coordinate, system, is, a, coordinate, system, per, iso, terminology, whereas, the, international, earth, rotation, and, reference, systems, service, iers, uses, the, term, reference, system, for, the, same, when, coordinates, are, realized, by, choosing, datum, points, and, fixing, a, geodetic, datum, iso, speaks, of, a, coordinate, reference, system, whereas, iers, uses, a, reference, frame, for, the, same, the, iso, term, for, a, datum, transformation, again, is, a, coordinate, transformation, general, geopositioning, or, simply, positioning, is, the, determination, of, the, location, of, points, on, earth, by, myriad, techniques, geodetic, positioning, employs, geodetic, methods, to, determine, a, set, of, precise, geodetic, coordinates, of, a, point, on, land, at, sea, or, in, space, it, may, be, done, within, a, coordinate, system, point, positioning, or, absolute, positioning, or, relative, to, another, point, relative, positioning, one, computes, the, position, of, a, point, in, space, from, measurements, linking, terrestrial, or, extraterrestrial, points, of, known, location, known, points, with, terrestrial, ones, of, unknown, location, unknown, points, the, computation, may, involve, transformations, between, or, among, astronomical, and, terrestrial, coordinate, systems, known, points, used, in, point, positioning, can, be, gnss, continuously, operating, reference, stations, or, triangulation, points, of, a, higher, order, network, traditionally, geodesists, built, a, hierarchy, of, networks, to, allow, point, positioning, within, a, country, the, highest, in, this, hierarchy, were, triangulation, networks, densified, into, the, networks, of, traverses, polygons, into, which, local, mapping, and, surveying, measurements, usually, collected, using, a, measuring, tape, a, corner, prism, and, the, red, and, white, poles, are, tied, commonly, used, nowadays, is, gps, except, for, specialized, measurements, e, g, in, underground, or, high, precision, engineering, the, higher, order, networks, are, measured, with, static, gps, using, differential, measurement, to, determine, vectors, between, terrestrial, points, these, vectors, then, get, adjusted, in, a, traditional, network, fashion, a, global, polyhedron, of, permanently, operating, gps, stations, under, the, auspices, of, the, iers, is, the, basis, for, defining, a, single, global, geocentric, reference, frame, that, serves, as, the, zero, order, global, reference, to, which, national, measurements, are, attached, real, time, kinematic, positioning, rtk, gps, is, employed, frequently, in, survey, mapping, in, that, measurement, technique, unknown, points, can, get, quickly, tied, into, nearby, terrestrial, known, points, one, purpose, of, point, positioning, is, the, provision, of, known, points, for, mapping, measurements, also, known, as, horizontal, and, vertical, control, there, can, be, thousands, of, those, geodetically, determined, points, in, a, country, usually, documented, by, national, mapping, agencies, surveyors, involved, in, real, estate, and, insurance, will, use, these, to, tie, their, local, measurements, in, geometrical, geodesy, there, are, two, main, problems, the, solutions, to, both, problems, in, plane, geometry, reduce, to, simple, trigonometry, and, are, valid, for, small, areas, on, earth, s, surface, on, a, sphere, solutions, become, significantly, more, complex, as, for, example, in, the, inverse, problem, the, azimuths, differ, going, between, the, two, end, points, along, the, arc, of, the, connecting, great, circle, the, general, solution, is, called, the, geodesic, for, the, surface, considered, and, the, differential, equations, for, the, geodesic, are, solvable, numerically, on, the, ellipsoid, of, revolution, geodesics, are, expressible, in, terms, of, elliptic, integrals, which, are, usually, evaluated, in, terms, of, a, series, expansion, see, for, example, vincenty, s, formulae, as, defined, in, geodesy, and, also, astronomy, some, basic, observational, concepts, like, angles, and, coordinates, include, most, commonly, from, the, viewpoint, of, a, local, observer, the, reference, surface, level, used, to, determine, height, differences, and, height, reference, systems, is, known, as, mean, sea, level, the, traditional, spirit, level, directly, produces, such, for, practical, purposes, most, useful, heights, above, sea, level, the, more, economical, use, of, gps, instruments, for, height, determination, requires, precise, knowledge, of, the, figure, of, the, geoid, as, gps, only, gives, heights, above, the, grs80, reference, ellipsoid, as, geoid, determination, improves, one, may, expect, that, the, use, of, gps, in, height, determination, shall, increase, too, the, theodolite, is, an, instrument, used, to, measure, horizontal, and, vertical, relative, to, the, local, vertical, angles, to, target, points, in, addition, the, tachymeter, determines, electronically, or, electro, optically, the, distance, to, a, target, and, is, highly, automated, or, even, robotic, in, operations, widely, used, for, the, same, purpose, is, the, method, of, free, station, position, commonly, for, local, detail, surveys, tachymeters, are, employed, although, the, old, fashioned, rectangular, technique, using, an, angle, prism, and, steel, tape, is, still, an, inexpensive, alternative, as, mentioned, also, there, are, quick, and, relatively, accurate, real, time, kinematic, rtk, gps, techniques, data, collected, are, tagged, and, recorded, digitally, for, entry, into, geographic, information, system, gis, databases, geodetic, gnss, most, commonly, gps, receivers, directly, produce, 3d, coordinates, in, a, geocentric, coordinate, frame, one, such, frame, is, wgs84, as, well, as, frames, by, the, international, earth, rotation, and, reference, systems, service, iers, gnss, receivers, have, almost, completely, replaced, terrestrial, instruments, for, large, scale, base, network, surveys, to, monitor, the, earth, s, rotation, irregularities, and, plate, tectonic, motions, and, for, planet, wide, geodetic, surveys, methods, of, very, long, baseline, interferometry, vlbi, measuring, distances, to, quasars, lunar, laser, ranging, llr, measuring, distances, to, prisms, on, the, moon, and, satellite, laser, ranging, slr, measuring, distances, to, prisms, on, artificial, satellites, are, employed, gravity, is, measured, using, gravimeters, of, which, there, are, two, kinds, first, are, absolute, gravimeter, s, based, on, measuring, the, acceleration, of, free, fall, e, g, of, a, reflecting, prism, in, a, vacuum, tube, they, are, used, to, establish, vertical, geospatial, control, or, in, the, field, second, relative, gravimeter, s, are, spring, based, and, more, common, they, are, used, in, gravity, surveys, over, large, areas, to, establish, the, figure, of, the, geoid, over, these, areas, the, most, accurate, relative, gravimeters, are, called, superconducting, gravimeter, s, which, are, sensitive, to, one, thousandth, of, one, billionth, of, earth, surface, gravity, twenty, some, superconducting, gravimeters, are, used, worldwide, in, studying, earth, s, tides, rotation, interior, oceanic, and, atmospheric, loading, as, well, as, in, verifying, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, in, the, future, gravity, and, altitude, might, become, measurable, using, the, special, relativistic, concept, of, time, dilation, as, gauged, by, optical, clocks, geographical, latitude, and, longitude, are, stated, in, the, units, degree, minute, of, arc, and, second, of, arc, they, are, angles, not, metric, measures, and, describe, the, direction, of, the, local, normal, to, the, reference, ellipsoid, of, revolution, this, direction, is, approximately, the, same, as, the, direction, of, the, plumbline, i, e, local, gravity, which, is, also, the, normal, to, the, geoid, surface, for, this, reason, astronomical, position, determination, measuring, the, direction, of, the, plumbline, by, astronomical, means, works, reasonably, well, when, one, also, uses, an, ellipsoidal, model, of, the, figure, of, the, earth, one, geographical, mile, defined, as, one, minute, of, arc, on, the, equator, equals, 1, 855, 32571922, m, one, nautical, mile, is, one, minute, of, astronomical, latitude, the, radius, of, curvature, of, the, ellipsoid, varies, with, latitude, being, the, longest, at, the, pole, and, the, shortest, at, the, equator, same, as, with, the, nautical, mile, a, metre, was, originally, defined, as, the, 10, millionth, part, of, the, length, from, the, equator, to, the, north, pole, along, the, meridian, through, paris, the, target, was, not, quite, reached, in, actual, implementation, as, it, is, off, by, 200, ppm, in, the, current, definitions, this, situation, means, that, one, kilometre, roughly, equals, 1, 40, 000, 360, 60, meridional, minutes, of, arc, or, 0, 54, nautical, miles, this, is, not, exactly, so, as, the, two, units, had, been, defined, on, different, bases, so, the, international, nautical, mile, is, 1, 852, m, exactly, which, corresponds, to, the, rounding, of, 1, 000, 0, 54, m, to, four, digits, various, techniques, are, used, in, geodesy, to, study, temporally, changing, surfaces, bodies, of, mass, physical, fields, and, dynamical, systems, points, on, earth, s, surface, change, their, location, due, to, a, variety, of, mechanisms, geodynamics, is, the, discipline, that, studies, deformations, and, motions, of, earth, s, crust, and, its, solidity, as, a, whole, often, the, study, of, earth, s, irregular, rotation, is, included, in, the, above, definition, geodynamical, studies, require, terrestrial, reference, frames, realized, by, the, stations, belonging, to, the, global, geodetic, observing, system, ggos, techniques, for, studying, geodynamic, phenomena, on, global, scales, include, geodesy, at, wikibooks, media, related, to, geodesy, at,
