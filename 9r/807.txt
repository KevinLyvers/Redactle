an, estuary, is, a, partially, enclosed, coastal, body, of, brackish, water, with, one, or, more, rivers, or, streams, flowing, into, it, and, with, a, free, connection, to, the, open, sea, estuaries, form, a, transition, zone, between, river, environments, and, maritime, environments, and, are, an, example, of, an, ecotone, estuaries, are, subject, both, to, marine, influences, such, as, tides, waves, and, the, influx, of, saline, water, and, to, fluvial, influences, such, as, flows, of, freshwater, and, sediment, the, mixing, of, seawater, and, freshwater, provides, high, levels, of, nutrients, both, in, the, water, column, and, in, sediment, making, estuaries, among, the, most, productive, natural, habitats, in, the, world, most, existing, estuaries, formed, during, the, holocene, epoch, with, the, flooding, of, river, eroded, or, glacially, scoured, valleys, when, the, sea, level, began, to, rise, about, 10, 000, 12, 000, years, ago, estuaries, are, typically, classified, according, to, their, geomorphological, features, or, to, water, circulation, patterns, they, can, have, many, different, names, such, as, bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or, sounds, although, some, of, these, water, bodies, do, not, strictly, meet, the, above, definition, of, an, estuary, and, could, be, fully, saline, many, estuaries, suffer, degeneration, from, a, variety, of, factors, including, soil, erosion, deforestation, overgrazing, overfishing, and, the, filling, of, wetlands, eutrophication, may, lead, to, excessive, nutrients, from, sewage, and, animal, wastes, pollutants, including, heavy, metals, polychlorinated, biphenyls, radionuclides, and, hydrocarbons, from, sewage, inputs, and, diking, or, damming, for, flood, control, or, water, diversion, the, word, estuary, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, aestuarium, meaning, tidal, inlet, of, the, sea, which, in, itself, is, derived, from, the, term, aestus, meaning, tide, there, have, been, many, definitions, proposed, to, describe, an, estuary, the, most, widely, accepted, definition, is, a, semi, enclosed, coastal, body, of, water, which, has, a, free, connection, with, the, open, sea, and, within, which, seawater, is, measurably, diluted, with, freshwater, derived, from, land, drainage, however, this, definition, excludes, a, number, of, coastal, water, bodies, such, as, coastal, lagoons, and, brackish, seas, a, more, comprehensive, definition, of, an, estuary, is, a, semi, enclosed, body, of, water, connected, to, the, sea, as, far, as, the, tidal, limit, or, the, salt, intrusion, limit, and, receiving, freshwater, runoff, however, the, freshwater, inflow, may, not, be, perennial, the, connection, to, the, sea, may, be, closed, for, part, of, the, year, and, tidal, influence, may, be, negligible, this, broad, definition, also, includes, fjords, lagoons, river, mouths, and, tidal, creeks, an, estuary, is, a, dynamic, ecosystem, having, a, connection, to, the, open, sea, through, which, the, sea, water, enters, with, the, rhythm, of, the, tides, the, effects, of, tides, on, estuaries, can, show, nonlinear, effects, on, the, movement, of, water, which, can, have, important, impacts, on, the, ecosystem, and, waterflow, the, seawater, entering, the, estuary, is, diluted, by, the, fresh, water, flowing, from, rivers, and, streams, the, pattern, of, dilution, varies, between, different, estuaries, and, depends, on, the, volume, of, freshwater, the, tidal, range, and, the, extent, of, evaporation, of, the, water, in, the, estuary, drowned, river, valleys, are, also, known, as, coastal, plain, estuaries, in, places, where, the, sea, level, is, rising, relative, to, the, land, sea, water, progressively, penetrates, into, river, valleys, and, the, topography, of, the, estuary, remains, similar, to, that, of, a, river, valley, this, is, the, most, common, type, of, estuary, in, temperate, climates, well, studied, estuaries, include, the, severn, estuary, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, ems, dollard, along, the, dutch, german, border, the, width, to, depth, ratio, of, these, estuaries, is, typically, large, appearing, wedge, shaped, in, cross, section, in, the, inner, part, and, broadening, and, deepening, seaward, water, depths, rarely, exceed, 30, m, 100, ft, examples, of, this, type, of, estuary, in, the, u, s, are, the, hudson, river, chesapeake, bay, and, delaware, bay, along, the, mid, atlantic, coast, and, galveston, bay, and, tampa, bay, along, the, gulf, coast, bar, built, estuaries, are, found, in, a, place, where, the, deposition, of, sediment, has, kept, pace, with, rising, sea, levels, so, that, the, estuaries, are, shallow, and, separated, from, the, sea, by, sand, spits, or, barrier, islands, they, are, relatively, common, in, tropical, and, subtropical, locations, these, estuaries, are, semi, isolated, from, ocean, waters, by, barrier, beaches, barrier, islands, and, barrier, spits, formation, of, barrier, beaches, partially, encloses, the, estuary, with, only, narrow, inlets, allowing, contact, with, the, ocean, waters, bar, built, estuaries, typically, develop, on, gently, sloping, plains, located, along, tectonically, stable, edges, of, continents, and, marginal, sea, coasts, they, are, extensive, along, the, atlantic, and, gulf, coasts, of, the, u, s, in, areas, with, active, coastal, deposition, of, sediments, and, where, tidal, ranges, are, less, than, 4, m, 13, ft, the, barrier, beaches, that, enclose, bar, built, estuaries, have, been, developed, in, several, ways, fjords, were, formed, where, pleistocene, glaciers, deepened, and, widened, existing, river, valleys, so, that, they, become, u, shaped, in, cross, sections, at, their, mouths, there, are, typically, rocks, bars, or, sills, of, glacial, deposits, which, have, the, effects, of, modifying, the, estuarine, circulation, fjord, type, estuaries, are, formed, in, deeply, eroded, valleys, formed, by, glaciers, these, u, shaped, estuaries, typically, have, steep, sides, rock, bottoms, and, underwater, sills, contoured, by, glacial, movement, the, estuary, is, shallowest, at, its, mouth, where, terminal, glacial, moraines, or, rock, bars, form, sills, that, restrict, water, flow, in, the, upper, reaches, of, the, estuary, the, depth, can, exceed, 300, m, 1, 000, ft, the, width, to, depth, ratio, is, generally, small, in, estuaries, with, very, shallow, sills, tidal, oscillations, only, affect, the, water, down, to, the, depth, of, the, sill, and, the, waters, deeper, than, that, may, remain, stagnant, for, a, very, long, time, so, there, is, only, an, occasional, exchange, of, the, deep, water, of, the, estuary, with, the, ocean, if, the, sill, depth, is, deep, water, circulation, is, less, restricted, and, there, is, a, slow, but, steady, exchange, of, water, between, the, estuary, and, the, ocean, fjord, type, estuaries, can, be, found, along, the, coasts, of, alaska, the, puget, sound, region, of, western, washington, state, british, columbia, eastern, canada, greenland, iceland, new, zealand, and, norway, these, estuaries, are, formed, by, subsidence, or, land, cut, off, from, the, ocean, by, land, movement, associated, with, faulting, volcanoes, and, landslides, inundation, from, eustatic, sea, level, rise, during, the, holocene, epoch, has, also, contributed, to, the, formation, of, these, estuaries, there, are, only, a, small, number, of, tectonically, produced, estuaries, one, example, is, the, san, francisco, bay, which, was, formed, by, the, crustal, movements, of, the, san, andreas, fault, system, causing, the, inundation, of, the, lower, reaches, of, the, sacramento, and, san, joaquin, rivers, in, this, type, of, estuary, river, output, greatly, exceeds, marine, input, and, tidal, effects, have, minor, importance, freshwater, floats, on, top, of, the, seawater, in, a, layer, that, gradually, thins, as, it, moves, seaward, the, denser, seawater, moves, landward, along, the, bottom, of, the, estuary, forming, a, wedge, shaped, layer, that, is, thinner, as, it, approaches, land, as, a, velocity, difference, develops, between, the, two, layers, shear, forces, generate, internal, waves, at, the, interface, mixing, the, seawater, upward, with, the, freshwater, an, examples, of, a, salt, wedge, estuary, is, mississippi, river, and, mandovi, estuary, in, goa, during, monsoon, period, as, tidal, forcing, increases, river, output, becomes, less, than, the, marine, input, here, current, induced, turbulence, causes, mixing, of, the, whole, water, column, such, that, salinity, varies, more, longitudinally, rather, than, vertically, leading, to, a, moderately, stratified, condition, examples, include, the, chesapeake, bay, and, narragansett, bay, tidal, mixing, forces, exceed, river, output, resulting, in, a, well, mixed, water, column, and, the, disappearance, of, the, vertical, salinity, gradient, the, freshwater, seawater, boundary, is, eliminated, due, to, the, intense, turbulent, mixing, and, eddy, effects, the, lower, reaches, of, delaware, bay, and, the, raritan, river, in, new, jersey, are, examples, of, vertically, homogeneous, estuaries, inverse, estuaries, occur, in, dry, climates, where, evaporation, greatly, exceeds, the, inflow, of, freshwater, a, salinity, maximum, zone, is, formed, and, both, riverine, and, oceanic, water, flow, close, to, the, surface, towards, this, zone, this, water, is, pushed, downward, and, spreads, along, the, bottom, in, both, the, seaward, and, landward, direction, examples, of, an, inverse, estuary, are, spencer, gulf, south, australia, saloum, river, and, casamance, river, senegal, estuary, type, varies, dramatically, depending, on, freshwater, input, and, is, capable, of, changing, from, a, wholly, marine, embayment, to, any, of, the, other, estuary, types, the, most, important, variable, characteristics, of, estuary, water, are, the, concentration, of, dissolved, oxygen, salinity, and, sediment, load, there, is, extreme, spatial, variability, in, salinity, with, a, range, of, near, zero, at, the, tidal, limit, of, tributary, rivers, to, 3, 4, at, the, estuary, mouth, at, any, one, point, the, salinity, will, vary, considerably, over, time, and, seasons, making, it, a, harsh, environment, for, organisms, sediment, often, settles, in, intertidal, mudflats, which, are, extremely, difficult, to, colonize, no, points, of, attachment, exist, for, algae, so, vegetation, based, habitat, is, not, established, sediment, can, also, clog, feeding, and, respiratory, structures, of, species, and, special, adaptations, exist, within, mudflat, species, to, cope, with, this, problem, lastly, dissolved, oxygen, variation, can, cause, problems, for, life, forms, nutrient, rich, sediment, from, human, made, sources, can, promote, primary, production, life, cycles, perhaps, leading, to, eventual, decay, removing, the, dissolved, oxygen, from, the, water, thus, hypoxic, or, anoxic, zones, can, develop, nitrogen, is, often, the, lead, cause, of, eutrophication, in, estuaries, in, temperate, zones, during, a, eutrophication, event, biogeochemical, feedback, decreases, the, amount, of, available, silica, these, feedbacks, also, increase, the, supply, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, creating, conditions, where, harmful, algal, blooms, can, persist, given, the, now, off, balance, nitrogen, cycle, estuaries, can, be, driven, to, phosphorus, limitation, instead, of, nitrogen, limitation, estuaries, can, be, severely, impacted, by, an, unbalanced, phosphorus, cycle, as, phosphorus, interacts, with, nitrogen, and, silica, availability, with, an, abundance, of, nutrients, in, the, ecosystem, plants, and, algae, overgrow, and, eventually, decompose, which, produce, a, significant, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, while, releasing, co, 2, into, the, water, and, atmosphere, these, organisms, are, also, intaking, all, or, nearly, all, of, the, available, oxygen, creating, a, hypoxic, environment, and, unbalanced, oxygen, cycle, the, excess, carbon, in, the, form, of, co, 2, can, lead, to, low, ph, levels, and, ocean, acidification, which, is, more, harmful, for, vulnerable, coastal, regions, like, estuaries, eutrophication, has, been, seen, to, negatively, impact, many, plant, communities, in, estuarine, ecosystems, salt, marshes, are, a, type, of, ecosystem, in, some, estuaries, that, have, been, negatively, impacted, by, eutrophication, cordgrass, vegetation, dominates, the, salt, marsh, landscape, excess, nutrients, allow, the, plants, to, grow, at, greater, rates, in, above, ground, biomass, however, less, energy, is, allocated, to, the, roots, since, nutrients, is, abundant, this, leads, to, a, lower, biomass, in, the, vegetation, below, ground, which, destabilizes, the, banks, of, the, marsh, causing, increased, rates, of, erosion, a, similar, phenomenon, occurs, in, mangrove, swamps, which, are, another, potential, ecosystem, in, estuaries, an, increase, in, nitrogen, causes, an, increase, in, shoot, growth, and, a, decrease, in, root, growth, weaker, root, systems, cause, a, mangrove, tree, to, be, less, resilient, in, seasons, of, drought, which, can, lead, to, the, death, of, the, mangrove, this, shift, in, above, ground, and, below, ground, biomass, caused, by, eutrophication, could, hindered, plant, success, in, these, ecosystems, across, all, biomes, eutrophication, often, results, in, plant, death, but, the, impacts, do, not, end, there, plant, death, alters, the, entire, food, web, structure, which, can, result, in, the, death, of, animals, within, the, afflicted, biome, estuaries, are, hotspots, for, biodiversity, containing, a, majority, of, commercial, fish, catch, making, the, impacts, of, eutrophication, that, much, greater, within, estuaries, some, specific, estuarine, animals, feel, the, effects, of, eutrophication, more, strongly, than, others, one, example, is, the, whitefish, species, from, the, european, alps, eutrophication, reduced, the, oxygen, levels, in, their, habitats, so, greatly, that, whitefish, eggs, could, not, survive, causing, local, extinctions, however, some, animals, such, as, carnivorous, fish, tend, to, do, well, in, nutrient, enriched, environments, and, can, benefit, from, eutrophication, this, can, be, seen, in, populations, of, bass, or, pikes, eutrophication, can, affect, many, marine, habitats, which, can, lead, to, economic, consequences, the, commercial, fishing, industry, relies, upon, estuaries, for, approximately, 68, percent, of, their, catch, by, value, because, of, the, great, biodiversity, of, this, ecosystem, during, an, algal, bloom, fishermen, have, noticed, a, significant, increase, in, the, quantity, of, fish, a, sudden, increase, in, primary, productivity, causes, spikes, in, fish, populations, which, leads, to, more, oxygen, being, utilized, it, is, the, continued, deoxygenation, of, the, water, that, then, causes, a, decline, in, fish, populations, these, effects, can, begin, in, estuaries, and, have, a, wide, effect, on, the, surrounding, water, bodies, in, turn, this, can, decrease, fishing, industry, sales, in, one, area, and, across, the, country, production, in, 2016, from, recreational, and, commercial, fishing, contributes, billions, of, dollars, to, the, united, states, gross, domestic, product, gdp, a, decrease, in, production, within, this, industry, can, affect, any, of, the, 1, 7, million, people, the, fishing, industry, employs, yearly, across, the, united, states, estuaries, are, incredibly, dynamic, systems, where, temperature, salinity, turbidity, depth, and, flow, all, change, daily, in, response, to, the, tides, this, dynamism, makes, estuaries, highly, productive, habitats, but, also, make, it, difficult, for, many, species, to, survive, year, round, as, a, result, estuaries, large, and, small, experience, strong, seasonal, variation, in, their, fish, communities, in, winter, the, fish, community, is, dominated, by, hardy, marine, residents, and, in, summer, a, variety, of, marine, and, anadromous, fishes, move, into, and, out, of, estuaries, capitalizing, on, their, high, productivity, estuaries, provide, a, critical, habitat, to, a, variety, of, species, that, rely, on, estuaries, for, life, cycle, completion, pacific, herring, clupea, pallasii, are, known, to, lay, their, eggs, in, estuaries, and, bays, surfperch, give, birth, in, estuaries, juvenile, flatfish, and, rockfish, migrate, to, estuaries, to, rear, and, anadromous, salmonids, and, lampreys, use, estuaries, as, migration, corridors, also, migratory, bird, populations, such, as, the, black, tailed, godwit, rely, on, estuaries, two, of, the, main, challenges, of, estuarine, life, are, the, variability, in, salinity, and, sedimentation, many, species, of, fish, and, invertebrates, have, various, methods, to, control, or, conform, to, the, shifts, in, salt, concentrations, and, are, termed, osmoconformers, and, osmoregulators, many, animals, also, burrow, to, avoid, predation, and, to, live, in, a, more, stable, sedimental, environment, however, large, numbers, of, bacteria, are, found, within, the, sediment, which, has, a, very, high, oxygen, demand, this, reduces, the, levels, of, oxygen, within, the, sediment, often, resulting, in, partially, anoxic, conditions, which, can, be, further, exacerbated, by, limited, water, flow, phytoplankton, are, key, primary, producers, in, estuaries, they, move, with, the, water, bodies, and, can, be, flushed, in, and, out, with, the, tides, their, productivity, is, largely, dependent, upon, the, turbidity, of, the, water, the, main, phytoplankton, present, are, diatoms, and, dinoflagellates, which, are, abundant, in, the, sediment, a, primary, source, of, food, for, many, organisms, on, estuaries, including, bacteria, is, detritus, from, the, settlement, of, the, sedimentation, of, the, thirty, two, largest, cities, in, the, world, in, the, early, 1990s, twenty, two, were, located, on, estuaries, as, ecosystems, estuaries, are, under, threat, from, human, activities, such, as, pollution, and, overfishing, they, are, also, threatened, by, sewage, coastal, settlement, land, clearance, and, much, more, estuaries, are, affected, by, events, far, upstream, and, concentrate, materials, such, as, pollutants, and, sediments, land, run, off, and, industrial, agricultural, and, domestic, waste, enter, rivers, and, are, discharged, into, estuaries, contaminants, can, be, introduced, which, do, not, disintegrate, rapidly, in, the, marine, environment, such, as, plastics, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols, and, heavy, metals, such, toxins, can, accumulate, in, the, tissues, of, many, species, of, aquatic, life, in, a, process, called, bioaccumulation, they, also, accumulate, in, benthic, environments, such, as, estuaries, and, bay, muds, a, geological, record, of, human, activities, of, the, last, century, the, elemental, composition, of, biofilm, reflect, areas, of, the, estuary, impacted, by, human, activities, and, over, time, may, shift, the, basic, composition, of, the, ecosystem, and, the, reversible, or, irreversible, changes, in, the, abiotic, and, biotic, parts, of, the, systems, from, the, bottom, up, for, example, chinese, and, russian, industrial, pollution, such, as, phenols, and, heavy, metals, has, devastated, fish, stocks, in, the, amur, river, and, damaged, its, estuary, soil, estuaries, tend, to, be, naturally, eutrophic, because, land, runoff, discharges, nutrients, into, estuaries, with, human, activities, land, run, off, also, now, includes, the, many, chemicals, used, as, fertilizers, in, agriculture, as, well, as, waste, from, livestock, and, humans, excess, oxygen, depleting, chemicals, in, the, water, can, lead, to, hypoxia, and, the, creation, of, dead, zones, this, can, result, in, reductions, in, water, quality, fish, and, other, animal, populations, overfishing, also, occurs, chesapeake, bay, once, had, a, flourishing, oyster, population, that, has, been, almost, wiped, out, by, overfishing, oysters, filter, these, pollutants, and, either, eat, them, or, shape, them, into, small, packets, that, are, deposited, on, the, bottom, where, they, are, harmless, historically, the, oysters, filtered, the, estuary, s, entire, water, volume, of, excess, nutrients, every, three, or, four, days, today, that, process, takes, almost, a, year, and, sediment, nutrients, and, algae, can, cause, problems, in, local, waters, some, major, rivers, that, run, through, deserts, historically, had, vast, expansive, estuaries, that, have, been, reduced, to, a, fraction, of, their, former, size, because, of, dams, and, diversions, one, example, is, the, colorado, river, delta, in, mexico, historically, covered, with, marshlands, and, forests, but, now, essentially, a, salt, flat
