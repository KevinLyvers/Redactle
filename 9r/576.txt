talc, or, talcum, is, a, clay, mineral, composed, of, hydrated, magnesium, silicate, with, the, chemical, formula, mg, 3, si, 4, o, 10, oh, 2, talc, in, powdered, form, often, combined, with, corn, starch, is, used, as, baby, powder, this, mineral, is, used, as, a, thickening, agent, and, lubricant, it, is, an, ingredient, in, ceramics, paints, and, roofing, material, it, is, a, main, ingredient, in, many, cosmetics, it, occurs, as, foliated, to, fibrous, masses, and, in, an, exceptionally, rare, crystal, form, it, has, a, perfect, basal, cleavage, and, an, uneven, flat, fracture, and, it, is, foliated, with, a, two, dimensional, platy, form, the, mohs, scale, of, mineral, hardness, based, on, scratch, hardness, comparison, defines, value, 1, as, the, hardness, of, talc, the, softest, mineral, when, scraped, on, a, streak, plate, talc, produces, a, white, streak, though, this, indicator, is, of, little, importance, because, most, silicate, minerals, produce, a, white, streak, talc, is, translucent, to, opaque, with, colors, ranging, from, whitish, grey, to, green, with, a, vitreous, and, pearly, luster, talc, is, not, soluble, in, water, and, is, slightly, soluble, in, dilute, mineral, acids, soapstone, is, a, metamorphic, rock, composed, predominantly, of, talc, the, word, talc, derives, from, persian, t, lk, in, ancient, times, the, word, was, used, for, various, related, minerals, including, talc, mica, and, selenite, talc, dominantly, forms, from, the, metamorphism, of, magnesian, minerals, such, as, serpentine, pyroxene, amphibole, and, olivine, in, the, presence, of, carbon, dioxide, and, water, this, is, known, as, talc, carbonation, or, steatization, and, produces, a, suite, of, rocks, known, as, talc, carbonates, talc, is, primarily, formed, by, hydration, and, carbonation, by, this, reaction, talc, can, also, be, formed, via, a, reaction, between, dolomite, and, silica, which, is, typical, of, skarnification, of, dolomites, by, silica, flooding, in, contact, metamorphic, aureoles, talc, can, also, be, formed, from, magnesium, chlorite, and, quartz, in, blueschist, and, eclogite, metamorphism, by, the, following, metamorphic, reaction, talc, is, also, found, as, a, diagenetic, mineral, in, sedimentary, rocks, where, it, can, form, from, the, transformation, of, metastable, hydrated, magnesium, clay, precursors, such, as, kerolite, sepiolite, or, stevensite, that, can, precipitate, from, marine, and, lake, water, in, certain, conditions, in, this, reaction, the, ratio, of, talc, and, kyanite, depends, on, aluminium, content, with, more, aluminous, rocks, favoring, production, of, kyanite, this, is, typically, associated, with, high, pressure, low, temperature, minerals, such, as, phengite, garnet, and, glaucophane, within, the, lower, blueschist, facies, such, rocks, are, typically, white, friable, and, fibrous, and, are, known, as, whiteschist, talc, is, a, trioctahedral, layered, mineral, its, structure, is, similar, to, pyrophyllite, but, with, magnesium, in, the, octahedral, sites, of, the, composite, layers, the, crystal, structure, of, talc, is, described, as, tot, meaning, that, it, is, composed, of, parallel, tot, layers, weakly, bonded, to, each, other, by, weak, van, der, waals, forces, the, tot, layers, in, turn, consist, of, two, tetrahedral, sheets, t, strongly, bonded, to, the, two, faces, of, a, single, trioctahedral, sheet, o, it, is, the, weak, bonding, between, tot, layers, that, gives, talc, its, perfect, basal, cleavage, and, softness, the, tetrahedral, sheets, consist, of, silica, tetrahedra, which, are, silicon, ions, surrounded, by, four, oxygen, ions, the, tetrahedra, each, share, three, of, their, four, oxygen, ions, with, neighboring, tetrahedra, to, produce, a, hexagonal, sheet, the, remaining, oxygen, ion, the, apical, oxygen, ion, is, available, to, bond, with, the, trioctahedral, sheet, the, trioctahedral, sheet, has, the, structure, of, a, sheet, of, the, mineral, brucite, apical, oxygens, take, the, place, of, some, of, the, hydroxyl, ions, that, would, be, present, in, a, brucite, sheet, bonding, the, tetrahedral, sheets, tightly, to, the, trioctahedral, sheet, tetrahedral, sheets, have, a, negative, charge, since, their, bulk, composition, is, si, 4, o, 10, 4, the, trioctahedral, sheet, has, an, equal, positive, charge, since, its, bulk, composition, is, mg, 3, oh, 2, 4, the, combined, tot, layer, thus, is, electrically, neutral, because, the, hexagons, in, the, t, and, o, sheets, are, slightly, different, in, size, the, sheets, are, slightly, distorted, when, they, bond, into, a, tot, layer, this, breaks, the, hexagonal, symmetry, and, reduces, it, to, monoclinic, or, triclinic, symmetry, however, the, original, hexahedral, symmetry, is, discernible, in, the, pseudotrigonal, character, of, talc, crystals, talc, is, a, common, metamorphic, mineral, in, metamorphic, belts, that, contain, ultramafic, rocks, such, as, soapstone, a, high, talc, rock, and, within, whiteschist, and, blueschist, metamorphic, terranes, prime, examples, of, whiteschists, include, the, franciscan, metamorphic, belt, of, the, western, united, states, the, western, european, alps, especially, in, italy, certain, areas, of, the, musgrave, block, and, some, collisional, orogens, such, as, the, himalayas, which, stretch, along, pakistan, india, nepal, and, bhutan, talc, carbonate, ultramafics, are, typical, of, many, areas, of, the, archaean, cratons, notably, the, komatiite, belts, of, the, yilgarn, craton, in, western, australia, talc, carbonate, ultramafics, are, also, known, from, the, lachlan, fold, belt, eastern, australia, from, brazil, the, guiana, shield, and, from, the, ophiolite, belts, of, turkey, oman, and, the, middle, east, china, is, the, key, world, talc, and, steatite, producing, country, with, an, output, of, about, 2, 2m, tonnes, 2016, which, accounts, for, 30, of, total, global, output, the, other, major, producers, are, brazil, 12, india, 11, the, u, s, 9, france, 6, finland, 4, italy, russia, canada, and, austria, 2, each, notable, economic, talc, occurrences, include, the, mount, seabrook, talc, mine, western, australia, formed, upon, a, polydeformed, layered, ultramafic, intrusion, the, france, based, luzenac, group, is, the, world, s, largest, supplier, of, mined, talc, its, largest, talc, mine, at, trimouns, near, luzenac, in, southern, france, produces, 400, 000, tonnes, of, talc, per, year, extraction, in, disputed, areas, of, nangarhar, province, afghanistan, has, led, the, international, monitoring, group, global, witness, to, declare, talc, a, conflict, resource, as, the, profits, are, used, to, fund, armed, confrontation, between, the, taliban, and, islamic, state, talc, is, used, in, many, industries, including, paper, making, plastic, paint, and, coatings, e, g, for, metal, casting, molds, rubber, food, electric, cable, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and, ceramics, a, coarse, grayish, green, high, talc, rock, is, soapstone, or, steatite, used, for, stoves, sinks, electrical, switchboards, etc, it, is, often, used, for, surfaces, of, laboratory, table, tops, and, electrical, switchboards, because, of, its, resistance, to, heat, electricity, and, acids, in, finely, ground, form, talc, finds, use, as, a, cosmetic, talcum, powder, as, a, lubricant, and, as, a, filler, in, paper, manufacture, it, is, used, to, coat, the, insides, of, inner, tubes, and, rubber, gloves, during, manufacture, to, keep, the, surfaces, from, sticking, talcum, powder, with, heavy, refinement, has, been, used, in, baby, powder, an, astringent, powder, used, to, prevent, diaper, rash, nappy, rash, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, that, parents, avoid, using, baby, powder, because, it, poses, a, risk, of, respiratory, problems, including, breathing, trouble, and, serious, lung, damage, if, inhaled, the, small, size, of, the, particles, makes, it, difficult, to, keep, them, out, of, the, air, while, applying, the, powder, zinc, oxide, based, ointments, are, a, much, safer, alternative, soapstone, massive, talc, is, often, used, as, a, marker, for, welding, or, metalworking, talc, is, also, used, as, food, additive, or, in, pharmaceutical, products, as, a, glidant, in, medicine, talc, is, used, as, a, pleurodesis, agent, to, prevent, recurrent, pleural, effusion, or, pneumothorax, in, the, european, union, the, additive, number, is, e553b, talc, may, be, used, in, the, processing, of, white, rice, as, a, buffing, agent, in, the, polishing, stage, due, to, its, low, shear, strength, talc, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, solid, lubricants, also, limited, use, is, made, of, talc, as, a, friction, reducing, additive, in, lubricating, oils, talc, is, widely, used, in, the, ceramics, industry, in, both, bodies, and, glazes, in, low, fire, art, ware, bodies, it, imparts, whiteness, and, increases, thermal, expansion, to, resist, crazing, in, stonewares, small, percentages, of, talc, are, used, to, flux, the, body, and, therefore, improve, strength, and, vitrification, it, is, a, source, of, mgo, flux, in, high, temperature, glazes, to, control, melting, temperature, it, is, also, employed, as, a, matting, agent, in, earthenware, glazes, and, can, be, used, to, produce, magnesia, mattes, at, high, temperatures, iso, standard, for, quality, iso, 3262, patents, are, pending, on, the, use, of, magnesium, silicate, as, a, cement, substitute, its, production, requirements, are, less, energy, intensive, than, ordinary, portland, cement, at, a, heating, requirement, of, around, 650, c, for, talc, compared, to, 1500, c, for, limestone, to, produce, portland, cement, while, it, absorbs, far, more, carbon, dioxide, as, it, hardens, this, results, in, a, negative, carbon, footprint, overall, as, the, cement, substitute, removes, 0, 6, tonnes, of, co, 2, per, tonne, used, this, contrasts, with, a, positive, carbon, footprint, of, 0, 4, tonnes, per, tonne, of, conventional, cement, talc, is, used, in, the, production, of, the, materials, that, are, widely, used, in, the, building, interiors, such, as, base, content, paints, in, wall, coatings, other, areas, that, use, talc, to, a, great, extent, are, organic, agriculture, the, food, industry, cosmetics, and, hygiene, products, such, as, baby, powder, and, detergent, powder, talc, is, sometimes, used, as, an, adulterant, to, illegal, heroin, to, expand, volume, and, weight, and, thereby, increase, its, street, value, with, intravenous, use, it, may, lead, to, pulmonary, talcosis, a, granulomatous, inflammation, in, the, lungs, sterile, talc, powder, ndc, 63256, 200, 05, is, a, sclerosing, agent, used, in, the, procedure, of, pleurodesis, this, can, be, helpful, as, a, cancer, treatment, to, prevent, pleural, effusions, an, abnormal, collection, of, fluid, in, the, space, between, the, lungs, and, the, thoracic, wall, it, is, inserted, into, the, space, via, a, chest, tube, causing, it, to, close, up, so, fluid, cannot, collect, there, the, product, can, be, sterilized, by, dry, heat, ethylene, oxide, or, gamma, irradiation, suspicions, have, been, raised, that, talc, use, contributes, to, certain, types, of, disease, mainly, cancers, of, the, ovaries, and, lungs, according, to, the, iarc, talc, containing, asbestos, is, classified, as, a, group, 1, agent, carcinogenic, to, humans, talc, use, in, the, perineum, is, classified, as, group, 2b, possibly, carcinogenic, to, humans, and, talc, not, containing, asbestos, is, classified, as, group, 3, unclassifiable, as, to, carcinogenicity, in, humans, reviews, by, cancer, research, uk, and, the, american, cancer, society, conclude, that, some, studies, have, found, a, link, but, other, studies, have, not, the, studies, discuss, pulmonary, issues, lung, cancer, and, ovarian, cancer, one, of, these, published, in, 1993, was, a, us, national, toxicology, program, report, which, found, that, cosmetic, grade, talc, containing, no, asbestos, like, fibres, was, correlated, with, tumor, formation, in, rats, forced, to, inhale, talc, for, 6, hours, a, day, five, days, a, week, over, at, least, 113, weeks, a, 1971, paper, found, particles, of, talc, embedded, in, 75, of, the, ovarian, tumors, studied, in, 2018, health, canada, issued, a, warning, against, inhaling, talcum, powder, or, women, s, using, it, perineally, in, contrast, however, research, published, in, 1995, and, 2000, concluded, that, although, it, was, plausible, that, talc, could, cause, ovarian, cancer, no, conclusive, evidence, had, been, shown, further, a, 2008, european, journal, of, cancer, prevention, review, of, ovarian, cancer, and, talc, use, studies, pointed, out, that, although, many, of, them, examined, the, duration, frequency, and, accumulation, of, hygienic, talc, use, few, found, a, positive, association, among, these, factors, and, some, found, a, negative, one, it, may, be, argued, that, the, overall, null, findings, associated, with, talc, dusted, diaphragms, and, condom, use, is, more, convincing, evidence, for, a, lack, of, a, carcinogenic, effect, especially, given, the, lack, of, an, established, correlation, between, perineal, dusting, frequency, and, ovarian, tissue, talc, concentrations, and, the, lack, of, a, consistent, dose, response, relationship, with, ovarian, cancer, risk, instead, the, authors, credited, powdered, talc, with, a, high, degree, of, safety, similarly, in, a, 2014, article, published, in, a, leading, cancer, journal, the, journal, of, the, national, cancer, institute, researchers, reported, the, results, of, a, survey, of, 61, 576, postmenopausal, women, more, than, half, of, whom, had, used, talc, powder, perineally, the, researchers, compared, the, subjects, reports, of, their, own, talc, use, with, their, reports, of, having, had, ovarian, cancer, diagnosed, by, their, doctors, and, found, regardless, of, subjects, age, and, tubal, ligation, status, ever, use, of, perineal, powder, was, not, associated, with, risk, of, ovarian, cancer, compared, with, never, use, nor, was, any, greater, individual, cancer, risk, associated, with, longer, use, of, talc, powder, on, this, basis, the, article, concluded, perineal, powder, use, does, not, appear, to, influence, ovarian, cancer, risk, the, cosmetic, ingredient, review, expert, panel, concluded, in, 2015, that, talc, in, the, concentrations, currently, used, in, cosmetics, is, safe, in, july, 2024, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, listed, talc, as, probably, carcinogenic, for, humans, the, study, is, based, on, limited, evidence, it, could, cause, ovarian, cancer, in, humans, in, the, united, states, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, and, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, have, set, occupational, exposure, limits, to, respirable, talc, dusts, at, 2, mg, m, 3, over, an, eight, hour, workday, at, levels, of, 1000, mg, m, 3, inhalation, of, talc, is, considered, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, considers, talc, magnesium, silicate, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, to, use, as, an, anticaking, agent, in, table, salt, in, concentrations, smaller, than, 2, one, particular, issue, with, commercial, use, of, talc, is, its, frequent, co, location, in, underground, deposits, with, asbestos, ore, asbestos, is, a, general, term, for, different, types, of, fibrous, silicate, minerals, desirable, in, construction, for, their, heat, resistant, properties, there, are, six, varieties, of, asbestos, the, most, common, variety, in, manufacturing, white, asbestos, is, in, the, serpentine, family, serpentine, minerals, are, sheet, silicates, although, not, in, the, serpentine, family, talc, is, also, a, sheet, silicate, with, two, sheets, connected, by, magnesium, cations, the, frequent, co, location, of, talc, deposits, with, asbestos, may, result, in, contamination, of, mined, talc, with, white, asbestos, which, poses, serious, health, risks, when, dispersed, into, the, air, and, inhaled, stringent, quality, control, since, 1976, including, separating, cosmetic, and, food, grade, talc, from, that, destined, for, industrial, use, has, largely, eliminated, this, issue, but, it, remains, a, potential, hazard, requiring, mitigation, in, the, mining, and, processing, of, talc, a, 2010, us, fda, survey, failed, to, find, asbestos, in, a, variety, of, talc, containing, products, a, 2018, reuters, investigation, asserted, that, pharmaceuticals, company, johnson, johnson, knew, for, decades, that, there, was, asbestos, in, its, baby, powder, and, in, 2020, the, company, stopped, selling, its, baby, powder, in, the, us, and, canada, there, were, calls, for, johnson, johnson, s, largest, shareholders, to, force, the, company, to, end, global, sales, of, baby, powder, and, hire, an, independent, firm, to, conduct, a, racial, justice, audit, as, it, had, been, marketed, to, african, american, and, overweight, women, on, august, 11, 2022, the, company, announced, it, would, stop, making, talc, based, powder, by, 2023, and, replace, it, with, cornstarch, based, powders, the, company, said, the, talc, based, powder, is, safe, to, use, and, does, not, contain, asbestos, in, 2006, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, classified, talcum, powder, as, a, possible, human, carcinogen, if, used, in, the, female, genital, area, despite, this, no, federal, agency, in, the, us, acted, to, remove, talcum, powder, from, the, market, or, add, warnings, in, february, 2016, as, the, result, of, a, lawsuit, against, johnson, johnson, j, j, a, st, louis, jury, awarded, 72, million, to, the, family, of, an, alabama, woman, who, died, from, ovarian, cancer, the, family, claimed, that, the, use, of, talcum, powder, was, responsible, for, her, cancer, in, may, 2016, a, south, dakota, woman, was, awarded, 55, million, as, the, result, of, another, lawsuit, against, j, j, the, woman, had, used, johnson, johnson, s, baby, powder, for, more, than, 35, years, before, being, diagnosed, with, ovarian, cancer, in, 2011, in, october, 2016, a, st, louis, jury, awarded, 70, 1, million, to, a, californian, woman, with, ovarian, cancer, who, had, used, johnson, s, baby, powder, for, 45, years, in, august, 2017, a, los, angeles, jury, awarded, 417, million, to, a, californian, woman, eva, echeverria, who, developed, ovarian, cancer, as, a, proximate, result, of, the, unreasonably, dangerous, and, defective, nature, of, talcum, powder, her, lawsuit, against, johnson, johnson, stated, on, 20, october, 2017, los, angeles, superior, court, judge, maren, nelson, dismissed, the, verdict, the, judge, stated, that, echeverria, proved, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, in, the, scientific, and, medical, community, about, whether, talc, more, probably, than, not, causes, ovarian, cancer, and, thus, gives, rise, to, a, duty, to, warn, but, not, enough, to, sustain, the, jury, s, imposition, of, liability, against, johnson, johnson, stated, and, concluded, that, echeverria, did, not, adequately, establish, that, talc, causes, ovarian, cancer, in, july, 2018, a, court, in, st, louis, awarded, a, 4, 7bn, claim, 4, 14bn, in, punitive, damages, and, 550m, in, compensatory, damages, against, j, j, to, 22, claimant, women, concluding, that, the, company, had, suppressed, evidence, of, asbestos, in, its, products, for, more, than, four, decades, at, least, 1, 200, to, 2, 000, other, talcum, powder, related, lawsuits, were, pending, as, of, 2016, in, 2020, j, j, stopped, sales, of, its, talcum, based, baby, powder, which, it, had, been, selling, for, 130, years, j, j, created, a, subsidiary, responsible, for, the, claims, in, an, effort, to, resolve, the, lawsuits, in, bankruptcy, court, in, 2023, j, j, proposed, a, nearly, 9bn, settlement, with, 50, 000, claimants, saying, the, claims, were, specious, but, it, wanted, to, move, on, from, the, issue, but, judges, blocked, the, plans, ruling, that, the, subsidiary, was, not, in, financial, distress, and, could, not, use, the, bankruptcy, system, to, resolve, the, lawsuits, in, july, 2023, j, j, sued, researchers, who, linked, talc, to, cancer, alleging, they, used, junk, science, to, disparage, company, s, products, while, defendants, say, the, lawsuits, are, meant, to, silence, scientists
