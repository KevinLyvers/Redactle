acetone, 2, propanone, or, dimethyl, ketone, is, an, organic, compound, with, the, formula, ch, 3, 2, co, it, is, the, simplest, and, smallest, ketone, c, o, it, is, a, colorless, highly, volatile, and, flammable, liquid, with, a, characteristic, pungent, odour, very, reminiscent, of, the, smell, of, pear, drops, acetone, is, miscible, with, water, and, serves, as, an, important, organic, solvent, in, industry, home, and, laboratory, about, 6, 7, million, tonnes, were, produced, worldwide, in, 2010, mainly, for, use, as, a, solvent, and, for, production, of, methyl, methacrylate, and, bisphenol, a, which, are, precursors, to, widely, used, plastics, it, is, a, common, building, block, in, organic, chemistry, it, serves, as, a, solvent, in, household, products, such, as, nail, polish, remover, and, paint, thinner, it, has, volatile, organic, compound, voc, exempt, status, in, the, united, states, acetone, is, produced, and, disposed, of, in, the, human, body, through, normal, metabolic, processes, it, is, normally, present, in, blood, and, urine, people, with, diabetic, ketoacidosis, produce, it, in, larger, amounts, ketogenic, diets, that, increase, ketone, bodies, acetone, hydroxybutyric, acid, and, acetoacetic, acid, in, the, blood, are, used, to, counter, epileptic, attacks, in, children, who, suffer, from, refractory, epilepsy, from, the, 17th, century, and, before, modern, developments, in, organic, chemistry, nomenclature, acetone, was, given, many, different, names, they, included, spirit, of, saturn, which, was, given, when, it, was, thought, to, be, a, compound, of, lead, and, later, pyro, acetic, spirit, and, pyro, acetic, ester, prior, to, the, name, acetone, being, coined, by, the, french, chemist, antoine, bussy, it, was, named, mesit, from, the, greek, meaning, mediator, by, carl, reichenbach, who, also, claimed, that, methyl, alcohol, consisted, of, mesit, and, ethyl, alcohol, names, derived, from, mesit, include, mesitylene, and, mesityl, oxide, which, were, first, synthesised, from, acetone, unlike, many, compounds, with, the, acet, prefix, which, have, a, 2, carbon, chain, acetone, has, a, 3, carbon, chain, that, has, caused, confusion, because, there, cannot, be, a, ketone, with, 2, carbons, the, prefix, refers, to, acetone, s, relation, to, vinegar, acetum, in, latin, also, the, source, of, the, words, acid, and, acetic, rather, than, its, chemical, structure, acetone, was, first, produced, by, andreas, libavius, in, 1606, by, distillation, of, lead, ii, acetate, in, 1832, french, chemist, jean, baptiste, dumas, and, german, chemist, justus, von, liebig, determined, the, empirical, formula, for, acetone, in, 1833, french, chemists, antoine, bussy, and, michel, chevreul, decided, to, name, acetone, by, adding, the, suffix, one, to, the, stem, of, the, corresponding, acid, viz, acetic, acid, just, as, a, similarly, prepared, product, of, what, was, then, confused, with, margaric, acid, was, named, margarone, by, 1852, english, chemist, alexander, william, williamson, realized, that, acetone, was, methyl, acetyl, the, following, year, the, french, chemist, charles, fr, d, ric, gerhardt, concurred, in, 1865, the, german, chemist, august, kekul, published, the, modern, structural, formula, for, acetone, johann, josef, loschmidt, had, presented, the, structure, of, acetone, in, 1861, but, his, privately, published, booklet, received, little, attention, during, world, war, i, chaim, weizmann, developed, the, process, for, industrial, production, of, acetone, weizmann, process, in, 2010, the, worldwide, production, capacity, for, acetone, was, estimated, at, 6, 7, million, tonnes, per, year, with, 1, 56, million, tonnes, per, year, the, united, states, had, the, highest, production, capacity, followed, by, taiwan, and, mainland, china, the, largest, producer, of, acetone, is, ineos, phenol, owning, 17, of, the, world, s, capacity, with, also, significant, capacity, 7, 8, by, mitsui, sunoco, and, shell, in, 2010, ineos, phenol, also, owns, the, world, s, largest, production, site, 420, 000, tonnes, annum, in, beveren, belgium, spot, price, of, acetone, in, summer, 2011, was, 1100, 1250, usd, tonne, in, the, united, states, acetone, is, produced, directly, or, indirectly, from, propene, approximately, 83, of, acetone, is, produced, via, the, cumene, process, as, a, result, acetone, production, is, tied, to, phenol, production, in, the, cumene, process, benzene, is, alkylated, with, propylene, to, produce, cumene, which, is, oxidized, by, air, to, produce, phenol, and, acetone, other, processes, involve, the, direct, oxidation, of, propylene, wacker, hoechst, process, or, the, hydration, of, propylene, to, give, 2, propanol, which, is, oxidized, dehydrogenated, to, acetone, previously, acetone, was, produced, by, the, dry, distillation, of, acetates, for, example, calcium, acetate, in, ketonic, decarboxylation, after, that, time, during, world, war, i, acetone, was, produced, using, acetone, butanol, ethanol, fermentation, with, clostridium, acetobutylicum, bacteria, which, was, developed, by, chaim, weizmann, later, the, first, president, of, israel, in, order, to, help, the, british, war, effort, in, the, preparation, of, cordite, this, acetone, butanol, ethanol, fermentation, was, eventually, abandoned, when, newer, methods, with, better, yields, were, found, the, flame, temperature, of, pure, acetone, is, 1980, c, like, most, ketones, acetone, exhibits, the, keto, enol, tautomerism, in, which, the, nominal, keto, structure, ch, 3, 2, c, o, of, acetone, itself, is, in, equilibrium, with, the, enol, isomer, ch, 3, c, oh, ch, 2, prop, 1, en, 2, ol, in, acetone, vapor, at, ambient, temperature, only, 2, 4, 10, 7, of, the, molecules, are, in, the, enol, form, in, the, presence, of, suitable, catalysts, two, acetone, molecules, also, combine, to, form, the, compound, diacetone, alcohol, ch, 3, c, o, ch, 2, c, oh, ch, 3, 2, which, on, dehydration, gives, mesityl, oxide, ch, 3, c, o, ch, c, ch, 3, 2, this, product, can, further, combine, with, another, acetone, molecule, with, loss, of, another, molecule, of, water, yielding, phorone, and, other, compounds, acetone, is, a, weak, lewis, base, that, forms, adducts, with, soft, acids, like, i, 2, and, hard, acids, like, phenol, acetone, also, forms, complexes, with, divalent, metals, one, might, expect, acetone, to, also, form, polymers, and, possibly, cyclic, oligomers, of, two, types, in, one, type, units, could, be, acetone, molecules, linked, by, ether, bridges, o, derived, from, opening, of, the, double, bond, to, give, a, polyketal, like, pka, chain, n, the, other, type, could, be, obtained, through, repeated, aldol, condensation, with, one, molecule, of, water, removed, at, each, step, yielding, a, poly, methylacetylene, pma, chain, n, the, conversion, of, acetone, to, a, polyketal, pka, would, be, analogous, to, the, formation, of, paraformaldehyde, from, formaldehyde, and, of, trithioacetone, from, thioacetone, in, 1960, soviet, chemists, observed, that, the, thermodynamics, of, this, process, is, unfavourable, for, liquid, acetone, so, that, it, unlike, thioacetone, and, formol, is, not, expected, to, polymerise, spontaneously, even, with, catalysts, however, they, observed, that, the, thermodynamics, became, favourable, for, crystalline, solid, acetone, at, the, melting, point, 96, c, they, claimed, to, have, obtained, such, a, polymer, a, white, elastic, solid, soluble, in, acetone, stable, for, several, hours, at, room, temperature, by, depositing, vapor, of, acetone, with, some, magnesium, as, a, catalyst, onto, a, very, cold, surface, in, 1962, wasaburo, kawai, reported, the, synthesis, of, a, similar, product, from, liquid, acetone, cooled, to, 70, to, 78, c, using, n, butyllithium, or, triethylaluminium, as, catalysts, he, claimed, that, the, infrared, absorption, spectrum, showed, the, presence, of, o, linkages, but, no, c, o, groups, however, conflicting, results, were, obtained, later, by, other, investigators, the, pma, type, polymers, of, acetone, would, be, equivalent, to, the, product, of, polymerisation, of, propyne, except, for, a, keto, end, group, humans, exhale, several, milligrams, of, acetone, per, day, it, arises, from, decarboxylation, of, acetoacetate, small, amounts, of, acetone, are, produced, in, the, body, by, the, decarboxylation, of, ketone, bodies, certain, dietary, patterns, including, prolonged, fasting, and, high, fat, low, carbohydrate, dieting, can, produce, ketosis, in, which, acetone, is, formed, in, body, tissue, certain, health, conditions, such, as, alcoholism, and, diabetes, can, produce, ketoacidosis, uncontrollable, ketosis, that, leads, to, a, sharp, and, potentially, fatal, increase, in, the, acidity, of, the, blood, since, it, is, a, byproduct, of, fermentation, acetone, is, a, byproduct, of, the, distillery, industry, acetone, can, then, be, metabolized, either, by, cyp2e1, via, methylglyoxal, to, d, lactate, and, pyruvate, and, ultimately, glucose, energy, or, by, a, different, pathway, via, propylene, glycol, to, pyruvate, lactate, acetate, usable, for, energy, and, propionaldehyde, about, a, third, of, the, world, s, acetone, is, used, as, a, solvent, and, a, quarter, is, consumed, as, acetone, cyanohydrin, a, precursor, to, methyl, methacrylate, acetone, is, a, good, solvent, for, many, plastics, and, some, synthetic, fibers, it, is, used, for, thinning, polyester, resin, cleaning, tools, used, with, it, and, dissolving, two, part, epoxies, and, superglue, before, they, harden, it, is, used, as, one, of, the, volatile, components, of, some, paints, and, varnishes, as, a, heavy, duty, degreaser, it, is, useful, in, the, preparation, of, metal, prior, to, painting, or, soldering, and, to, remove, rosin, flux, after, soldering, to, prevent, adhesion, of, dirt, and, electrical, leakage, and, perhaps, corrosion, or, for, cosmetic, reasons, although, it, may, attack, some, electronic, components, such, as, polystyrene, capacitors, although, itself, flammable, acetone, is, used, extensively, as, a, solvent, for, the, safe, transportation, and, storage, of, acetylene, which, cannot, be, safely, pressurized, as, a, pure, compound, vessels, containing, a, porous, material, are, first, filled, with, acetone, followed, by, acetylene, which, dissolves, into, the, acetone, one, litre, of, acetone, can, dissolve, around, 250, litres, of, acetylene, at, a, pressure, of, 10, bars, 1, 0, mpa, acetone, is, used, as, a, solvent, by, the, pharmaceutical, industry, and, as, a, denaturant, in, denatured, alcohol, acetone, is, also, present, as, an, excipient, in, some, pharmaceutical, drugs, acetone, is, used, to, synthesize, methyl, methacrylate, it, begins, with, the, initial, conversion, of, acetone, to, acetone, cyanohydrin, via, reaction, with, hydrogen, cyanide, hcn, in, a, subsequent, step, the, nitrile, is, hydrolyzed, to, the, unsaturated, amide, which, is, esterified, the, third, major, use, of, acetone, about, 20, is, synthesizing, bisphenol, a, bisphenol, a, is, a, component, of, many, polymers, such, as, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, and, epoxy, resins, the, synthesis, involves, the, condensation, of, acetone, with, phenol, many, millions, of, kilograms, of, acetone, are, consumed, in, the, production, of, the, solvents, methyl, isobutyl, alcohol, and, methyl, isobutyl, ketone, these, products, arise, via, an, initial, aldol, condensation, to, give, diacetone, alcohol, condensation, with, acetylene, gives, 2, methylbut, 3, yn, 2, ol, precursor, to, synthetic, terpenes, and, terpenoids, a, variety, of, organic, reactions, employ, acetone, as, a, polar, aprotic, solvent, it, is, critical, in, the, jones, oxidation, because, acetone, is, cheap, volatile, and, dissolves, or, decomposes, with, most, laboratory, chemicals, an, acetone, rinse, is, the, standard, technique, to, remove, solid, resides, from, laboratory, glassware, before, a, final, wash, despite, common, desiccatory, use, acetone, dries, only, via, bulk, displacement, and, dilution, it, forms, no, azeotropes, with, water, see, azeotrope, tables, acetone, freezes, well, below, 78, c, an, acetone, dry, ice, mixture, cools, many, low, temperature, reactions, under, ultraviolet, light, acetone, fluoresces, fluid, flow, experiments, use, its, vapor, as, a, tracer, proteins, precipitate, in, acetone, the, chemical, modifies, peptides, both, at, or, amino, groups, and, in, a, poorly, understood, but, rapid, modification, of, certain, glycine, residues, in, pathology, acetone, helps, find, lymph, nodes, in, fatty, tissues, such, as, the, mesentery, for, tumor, staging, the, liquid, dissolves, the, fat, and, hardens, the, nodes, making, them, easier, to, find, acetone, also, removes, certain, stains, from, microscope, slides, dermatologists, use, acetone, with, alcohol, for, acne, treatments, to, chemically, peel, dry, skin, common, agents, used, today, for, chemical, peeling, are, salicylic, acid, glycolic, acid, azelaic, acid, 30, salicylic, acid, in, ethanol, and, trichloroacetic, acid, tca, prior, to, chemexfoliation, the, skin, is, cleaned, and, excess, fat, removed, in, a, process, called, defatting, acetone, hexachlorophene, or, a, combination, of, these, agents, was, used, in, this, process, acetone, has, been, shown, to, have, anticonvulsant, effects, in, animal, models, of, epilepsy, in, the, absence, of, toxicity, when, administered, in, millimolar, concentrations, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, high, fat, low, carbohydrate, ketogenic, diet, used, clinically, to, control, drug, resistant, epilepsy, in, children, works, by, elevating, acetone, in, the, brain, because, of, their, higher, energy, requirements, children, have, higher, acetone, production, than, most, adults, and, the, younger, the, child, the, higher, the, expected, production, this, indicates, that, children, are, not, uniquely, susceptible, to, acetone, exposure, external, exposures, are, small, compared, to, the, exposures, associated, with, the, ketogenic, diet, make, up, artists, use, acetone, to, remove, skin, adhesive, from, the, netting, of, wigs, and, mustaches, by, immersing, the, item, in, an, acetone, bath, then, removing, the, softened, glue, residue, with, a, stiff, brush, acetone, is, a, main, ingredient, in, many, nail, polish, removers, because, it, breaks, down, nail, polish, it, is, used, for, all, types, of, nail, polish, removal, like, gel, nail, polish, dip, powder, and, acrylic, nails, acetone, is, often, used, for, vapor, polishing, of, printing, artifacts, on, 3d, printed, models, printed, with, abs, plastic, the, technique, called, acetone, vapor, bath, smoothing, involves, placing, the, printed, part, in, a, sealed, chamber, containing, a, small, amount, of, acetone, and, heating, to, around, 80, degrees, celsius, for, ten, minutes, this, creates, a, vapor, of, acetone, in, the, container, the, acetone, condenses, evenly, all, over, the, part, causing, the, surface, to, soften, and, liquefy, surface, tension, then, smooths, the, semi, liquid, plastic, when, the, part, is, removed, from, the, chamber, the, acetone, component, evaporates, leaving, a, glassy, smooth, part, free, of, striation, patterning, and, visible, layer, edges, common, features, in, untreated, 3d, printed, parts, acetone, efficiently, removes, felt, tipped, pen, marks, from, glass, and, metals, acetone, s, most, hazardous, property, is, its, extreme, flammability, in, small, amounts, acetone, burns, with, a, dull, blue, flame, in, larger, amounts, fuel, evaporation, causes, incomplete, combustion, and, a, bright, yellow, flame, when, hotter, than, acetone, s, flash, point, of, 20, c, 4, f, air, mixtures, of, 2, 5, 12, 8, acetone, by, volume, may, explode, or, cause, a, flash, fire, vapors, can, flow, along, surfaces, to, distant, ignition, sources, and, flash, back, static, discharge, may, also, ignite, acetone, vapors, though, acetone, has, a, very, high, ignition, initiation, energy, and, accidental, ignition, is, rare, acetone, s, auto, ignition, temperature, is, the, relatively, high, 465, c, 869, f, moreover, auto, ignition, temperature, depends, upon, experimental, conditions, such, as, exposure, time, and, has, been, quoted, as, high, as, 535, c, even, pouring, or, spraying, acetone, over, red, glowing, coal, will, not, ignite, it, due, to, the, high, vapour, concentration, and, the, cooling, effect, of, evaporation, acetone, should, be, stored, away, from, strong, oxidizers, such, as, concentrated, nitric, and, sulfuric, acid, mixtures, it, may, also, explode, when, mixed, with, chloroform, in, the, presence, of, a, base, when, oxidized, without, combustion, for, example, with, hydrogen, peroxide, acetone, may, form, acetone, peroxide, a, highly, unstable, primary, explosive, acetone, peroxide, may, be, formed, accidentally, e, g, when, waste, peroxide, is, poured, into, waste, solvents, acetone, occurs, naturally, as, part, of, certain, metabolic, processes, in, the, human, body, and, has, been, studied, extensively, and, is, believed, to, exhibit, only, slight, toxicity, in, normal, use, there, is, no, strong, evidence, of, chronic, health, effects, if, basic, precautions, are, followed, it, is, generally, recognized, to, have, low, acute, and, chronic, toxicity, if, ingested, and, or, inhaled, acetone, is, not, currently, regarded, as, a, carcinogen, a, mutagen, or, a, concern, for, chronic, neurotoxicity, effects, acetone, can, be, found, as, an, ingredient, in, a, variety, of, consumer, products, ranging, from, cosmetics, to, processed, and, unprocessed, foods, acetone, has, been, rated, as, a, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, substance, when, present, in, drinks, baked, foods, desserts, and, preserves, at, concentrations, ranging, from, 5, to, 8, mg, l, acetone, is, however, an, irritant, causing, mild, skin, and, moderate, to, severe, eye, irritation, at, high, vapor, concentrations, it, may, depress, the, central, nervous, system, like, many, other, solvents, acute, toxicity, for, mice, by, ingestion, ld, 50, is, 3, g, kg, and, by, inhalation, lc, 50, is, 44, g, m, 3, over, 4, hours, although, acetone, occurs, naturally, in, the, environment, in, plants, trees, volcanic, gases, forest, fires, and, as, a, product, of, the, breakdown, of, body, fat, the, majority, of, the, acetone, released, into, the, environment, is, of, industrial, origin, acetone, evaporates, rapidly, even, from, water, and, soil, once, in, the, atmosphere, it, has, a, 22, day, half, life, and, is, degraded, by, uv, light, via, photolysis, primarily, into, methane, and, ethane, consumption, by, microorganisms, contributes, to, the, dissipation, of, acetone, in, soil, animals, or, waterways, in, 1995, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, removed, acetone, from, the, list, of, volatile, organic, compounds, the, companies, requesting, the, removal, argued, that, it, would, contribute, to, the, achievement, of, several, important, environmental, goals, and, would, support, epa, s, pollution, prevention, efforts, and, that, acetone, could, be, used, as, a, substitute, for, several, compounds, that, are, listed, as, hazardous, air, pollutants, hap, under, section, 112, of, the, clean, air, act, in, making, its, decision, epa, conducted, an, extensive, review, of, the, available, toxicity, data, on, acetone, which, was, continued, through, the, 2000s, it, found, that, the, evaluable, data, are, inadequate, for, an, assessment, of, the, human, carcinogenic, potential, of, acetone, on, 30, july, 2015, scientists, reported, that, upon, the, first, touchdown, of, the, philae, lander, on, comet, 67p, s, surface, measurements, by, the, cosac, and, ptolemy, instruments, revealed, sixteen, organic, compounds, four, of, which, were, seen, for, the, first, time, on, a, comet, including, acetamide, acetone, methyl, isocyanate, and, propionaldehyde
