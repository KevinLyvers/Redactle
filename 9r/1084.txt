the, ideal, gas, law, also, called, the, general, gas, equation, is, the, equation, of, state, of, a, hypothetical, ideal, gas, it, is, a, good, approximation, of, the, behavior, of, many, gases, under, many, conditions, although, it, has, several, limitations, it, was, first, stated, by, beno, t, paul, mile, clapeyron, in, 1834, as, a, combination, of, the, empirical, boyle, s, law, charles, s, law, avogadro, s, law, and, gay, lussac, s, law, the, ideal, gas, law, is, often, written, in, an, empirical, form, p, v, n, r, t, displaystyle, pv, nrt, where, p, displaystyle, p, v, displaystyle, v, and, t, displaystyle, t, are, the, pressure, volume, and, temperature, respectively, n, displaystyle, n, is, the, amount, of, substance, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, ideal, gas, constant, it, can, also, be, derived, from, the, microscopic, kinetic, theory, as, was, achieved, apparently, independently, by, august, kr, nig, in, 1856, and, rudolf, clausius, in, 1857, the, state, of, an, amount, of, gas, is, determined, by, its, pressure, volume, and, temperature, the, modern, form, of, the, equation, relates, these, simply, in, two, main, forms, the, temperature, used, in, the, equation, of, state, is, an, absolute, temperature, the, appropriate, si, unit, is, the, kelvin, the, most, frequently, introduced, forms, are, p, v, n, r, t, n, k, b, n, a, t, n, k, b, t, displaystyle, pv, nrt, nk, text, b, n, text, a, t, nk, text, b, t, where, in, si, units, p, is, measured, in, pascals, v, is, measured, in, cubic, metres, n, is, measured, in, moles, and, t, in, kelvins, the, kelvin, scale, is, a, shifted, celsius, scale, where, 0, 00, k, 273, 15, c, the, lowest, possible, temperature, r, has, for, value, 8, 314, j, mol, k, 1, 989, 2, cal, mol, k, or, 0, 0821, l, atm, mol, k, how, much, gas, is, present, could, be, specified, by, giving, the, mass, instead, of, the, chemical, amount, of, gas, therefore, an, alternative, form, of, the, ideal, gas, law, may, be, useful, the, chemical, amount, n, in, moles, is, equal, to, total, mass, of, the, gas, m, in, kilograms, divided, by, the, molar, mass, m, in, kilograms, per, mole, by, replacing, n, with, m, m, and, subsequently, introducing, density, m, v, we, get, defining, the, specific, gas, constant, r, specific, as, the, ratio, r, m, this, form, of, the, ideal, gas, law, is, very, useful, because, it, links, pressure, density, and, temperature, in, a, unique, formula, independent, of, the, quantity, of, the, considered, gas, alternatively, the, law, may, be, written, in, terms, of, the, specific, volume, v, the, reciprocal, of, density, as, it, is, common, especially, in, engineering, and, meteorological, applications, to, represent, the, specific, gas, constant, by, the, symbol, r, in, such, cases, the, universal, gas, constant, is, usually, given, a, different, symbol, such, as, r, displaystyle, bar, r, or, r, displaystyle, r, to, distinguish, it, in, any, case, the, context, and, or, units, of, the, gas, constant, should, make, it, clear, as, to, whether, the, universal, or, specific, gas, constant, is, being, used, in, statistical, mechanics, the, following, molecular, equation, is, derived, from, first, principles, where, p, is, the, absolute, pressure, of, the, gas, n, is, the, number, density, of, the, molecules, given, by, the, ratio, n, n, v, in, contrast, to, the, previous, formulation, in, which, n, is, the, number, of, moles, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, relating, temperature, and, energy, given, by, where, n, a, is, the, avogadro, constant, from, this, we, notice, that, for, a, gas, of, mass, m, with, an, average, particle, mass, of, times, the, atomic, mass, constant, m, u, i, e, the, mass, is, da, the, number, of, molecules, will, be, given, by, and, since, m, v, n, m, u, we, find, that, the, ideal, gas, law, can, be, rewritten, as, in, si, units, p, is, measured, in, pascals, v, in, cubic, metres, t, in, kelvins, and, k, b, 1, 38, 10, 23, j, k, 1, in, si, units, combining, the, laws, of, charles, boyle, and, gay, lussac, gives, the, combined, gas, law, which, takes, the, same, functional, form, as, the, ideal, gas, law, says, that, the, number, of, moles, is, unspecified, and, the, ratio, of, p, v, displaystyle, pv, to, t, displaystyle, t, is, simply, taken, as, a, constant, where, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, pressure, of, the, gas, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, volume, of, the, gas, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, of, the, gas, and, k, displaystyle, k, is, a, constant, when, comparing, the, same, substance, under, two, different, sets, of, conditions, the, law, can, be, written, as, according, to, the, assumptions, of, the, kinetic, theory, of, ideal, gases, one, can, consider, that, there, are, no, intermolecular, attractions, between, the, molecules, or, atoms, of, an, ideal, gas, in, other, words, its, potential, energy, is, zero, hence, all, the, energy, possessed, by, the, gas, is, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, molecules, or, atoms, of, the, gas, this, corresponds, to, the, kinetic, energy, of, n, moles, of, a, monoatomic, gas, having, 3, degrees, of, freedom, x, y, z, the, table, here, below, gives, this, relationship, for, different, amounts, of, a, monoatomic, gas, the, table, below, essentially, simplifies, the, ideal, gas, equation, for, a, particular, processes, thus, making, this, equation, easier, to, solve, using, numerical, methods, a, thermodynamic, process, is, defined, as, a, system, that, moves, from, state, 1, to, state, 2, where, the, state, number, is, denoted, by, subscript, as, shown, in, the, first, column, of, the, table, basic, thermodynamic, processes, are, defined, such, that, one, of, the, gas, properties, p, v, t, s, or, h, is, constant, throughout, the, process, for, a, given, thermodynamics, process, in, order, to, specify, the, extent, of, a, particular, process, one, of, the, properties, ratios, which, are, listed, under, the, column, labeled, known, ratio, must, be, specified, either, directly, or, indirectly, also, the, property, for, which, the, ratio, is, known, must, be, distinct, from, the, property, held, constant, in, the, previous, column, otherwise, the, ratio, would, be, unity, and, not, enough, information, would, be, available, to, simplify, the, gas, law, equation, in, the, final, three, columns, the, properties, p, v, or, t, at, state, 2, can, be, calculated, from, the, properties, at, state, 1, using, the, equations, listed, a, in, an, isentropic, process, system, entropy, s, is, constant, under, these, conditions, p, 1, v, 1, p, 2, v, 2, where, is, defined, as, the, heat, capacity, ratio, which, is, constant, for, a, calorifically, perfect, gas, the, value, used, for, is, typically, 1, 4, for, diatomic, gases, like, nitrogen, n, 2, and, oxygen, o, 2, and, air, which, is, 99, diatomic, also, is, typically, 1, 6, for, mono, atomic, gases, like, the, noble, gases, helium, he, and, argon, ar, in, internal, combustion, engines, varies, between, 1, 35, and, 1, 15, depending, on, constitution, gases, and, temperature, b, in, an, isenthalpic, process, system, enthalpy, h, is, constant, in, the, case, of, free, expansion, for, an, ideal, gas, there, are, no, molecular, interactions, and, the, temperature, remains, constant, for, real, gasses, the, molecules, do, interact, via, attraction, or, repulsion, depending, on, temperature, and, pressure, and, heating, or, cooling, does, occur, this, is, known, as, the, joule, thomson, effect, for, reference, the, joule, thomson, coefficient, jt, for, air, at, room, temperature, and, sea, level, is, 0, 22, c, bar, the, equation, of, state, given, here, pv, nrt, applies, only, to, an, ideal, gas, or, as, an, approximation, to, a, real, gas, that, behaves, sufficiently, like, an, ideal, gas, there, are, in, fact, many, different, forms, of, the, equation, of, state, since, the, ideal, gas, law, neglects, both, molecular, size, and, intermolecular, attractions, it, is, most, accurate, for, monatomic, gases, at, high, temperatures, and, low, pressures, the, neglect, of, molecular, size, becomes, less, important, for, lower, densities, i, e, for, larger, volumes, at, lower, pressures, because, the, average, distance, between, adjacent, molecules, becomes, much, larger, than, the, molecular, size, the, relative, importance, of, intermolecular, attractions, diminishes, with, increasing, thermal, kinetic, energy, i, e, with, increasing, temperatures, more, detailed, equations, of, state, such, as, the, van, der, waals, equation, account, for, deviations, from, ideality, caused, by, molecular, size, and, intermolecular, forces, the, empirical, laws, that, led, to, the, derivation, of, the, ideal, gas, law, were, discovered, with, experiments, that, changed, only, 2, state, variables, of, the, gas, and, kept, every, other, one, constant, all, the, possible, gas, laws, that, could, have, been, discovered, with, this, kind, of, setup, are, where, p, stands, for, pressure, v, for, volume, n, for, number, of, particles, in, the, gas, and, t, for, temperature, where, c, 1, c, 2, c, 3, c, 4, c, 5, c, 6, displaystyle, c, 1, c, 2, c, 3, c, 4, c, 5, c, 6, are, constants, in, this, context, because, of, each, equation, requiring, only, the, parameters, explicitly, noted, in, them, changing, to, derive, the, ideal, gas, law, one, does, not, need, to, know, all, 6, formulas, one, can, just, know, 3, and, with, those, derive, the, rest, or, just, one, more, to, be, able, to, get, the, ideal, gas, law, which, needs, 4, since, each, formula, only, holds, when, only, the, state, variables, involved, in, said, formula, change, while, the, others, which, are, a, property, of, the, gas, but, are, not, explicitly, noted, in, said, formula, remain, constant, we, cannot, simply, use, algebra, and, directly, combine, them, all, this, is, why, boyle, did, his, experiments, while, keeping, n, and, t, constant, and, this, must, be, taken, into, account, in, this, same, way, every, experiment, kept, some, parameter, as, constant, and, this, must, be, taken, into, account, for, the, derivation, keeping, this, in, mind, to, carry, the, derivation, on, correctly, one, must, imagine, the, gas, being, altered, by, one, process, at, a, time, as, it, was, done, in, the, experiments, the, derivation, using, 4, formulas, can, look, like, this, at, first, the, gas, has, parameters, p, 1, v, 1, n, 1, t, 1, displaystyle, p, 1, v, 1, n, 1, t, 1, say, starting, to, change, only, pressure, and, volume, according, to, boyle, s, law, equation, 1, then, after, this, process, the, gas, has, parameters, p, 2, v, 2, n, 1, t, 1, displaystyle, p, 2, v, 2, n, 1, t, 1, using, then, equation, 5, to, change, the, number, of, particles, in, the, gas, and, the, temperature, after, this, process, the, gas, has, parameters, p, 2, v, 2, n, 2, t, 2, displaystyle, p, 2, v, 2, n, 2, t, 2, using, then, equation, 6, to, change, the, pressure, and, the, number, of, particles, after, this, process, the, gas, has, parameters, p, 3, v, 2, n, 3, t, 2, displaystyle, p, 3, v, 2, n, 3, t, 2, using, then, charles, s, law, equation, 2, to, change, the, volume, and, temperature, of, the, gas, after, this, process, the, gas, has, parameters, p, 3, v, 3, n, 3, t, 3, displaystyle, p, 3, v, 3, n, 3, t, 3, using, simple, algebra, on, equations, 7, 8, 9, and, 10, yields, the, result, p, 1, v, 1, n, 1, t, 1, p, 3, v, 3, n, 3, t, 3, displaystyle, frac, p, 1, v, 1, n, 1, t, 1, frac, p, 3, v, 3, n, 3, t, 3, or, p, v, n, t, k, b, displaystyle, frac, pv, nt, k, text, b, where, k, b, displaystyle, k, text, b, stands, for, the, boltzmann, constant, another, equivalent, result, using, the, fact, that, n, r, n, k, b, displaystyle, nr, nk, text, b, where, n, is, the, number, of, moles, in, the, gas, and, r, is, the, universal, gas, constant, is, p, v, n, r, t, displaystyle, pv, nrt, which, is, known, as, the, ideal, gas, law, if, three, of, the, six, equations, are, known, it, may, be, possible, to, derive, the, remaining, three, using, the, same, method, however, because, each, formula, has, two, variables, this, is, possible, only, for, certain, groups, of, three, for, example, if, you, were, to, have, equations, 1, 2, and, 4, you, would, not, be, able, to, get, any, more, because, combining, any, two, of, them, will, only, give, you, the, third, however, if, you, had, equations, 1, 2, and, 3, you, would, be, able, to, get, all, six, equations, because, combining, 1, and, 2, will, yield, 4, then, 1, and, 3, will, yield, 6, then, 4, and, 6, will, yield, 5, as, well, as, would, the, combination, of, 2, and, 3, as, is, explained, in, the, following, visual, relation, where, the, numbers, represent, the, gas, laws, numbered, above, if, you, were, to, use, the, same, method, used, above, on, 2, of, the, 3, laws, on, the, vertices, of, one, triangle, that, has, a, o, inside, it, you, would, get, the, third, for, example, change, only, pressure, and, volume, first, then, only, volume, and, temperature, then, as, we, can, choose, any, value, for, v, 3, displaystyle, v, 3, if, we, set, v, 1, v, 3, displaystyle, v, 1, v, 3, equation, 2, becomes, combining, equations, 1, and, 3, yields, p, 1, t, 1, p, 2, t, 2, displaystyle, frac, p, 1, t, 1, frac, p, 2, t, 2, which, is, equation, 4, of, which, we, had, no, prior, knowledge, until, this, derivation, the, ideal, gas, law, can, also, be, derived, from, first, principles, using, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, in, which, several, simplifying, assumptions, are, made, chief, among, which, are, that, the, molecules, or, atoms, of, the, gas, are, point, masses, possessing, mass, but, no, significant, volume, and, undergo, only, elastic, collisions, with, each, other, and, the, sides, of, the, container, in, which, both, linear, momentum, and, kinetic, energy, are, conserved, first, we, show, that, the, fundamental, assumptions, of, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, imply, that, consider, a, container, in, the, x, y, z, displaystyle, xyz, cartesian, coordinate, system, for, simplicity, we, assume, that, a, third, of, the, molecules, moves, parallel, to, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, a, third, moves, parallel, to, the, y, displaystyle, y, axis, and, a, third, moves, parallel, to, the, z, displaystyle, z, axis, if, all, molecules, move, with, the, same, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, denote, the, corresponding, pressure, by, p, 0, displaystyle, p, 0, we, choose, an, area, s, displaystyle, s, on, a, wall, of, the, container, perpendicular, to, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, when, time, t, displaystyle, t, elapses, all, molecules, in, the, volume, v, t, s, displaystyle, vts, moving, in, the, positive, direction, of, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, will, hit, the, area, there, are, n, v, t, s, v, displaystyle, nvts, v, molecules, in, a, part, of, volume, v, t, s, displaystyle, vts, of, the, container, but, only, one, sixth, i, e, a, half, of, a, third, of, them, moves, in, the, positive, direction, of, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, therefore, the, number, of, molecules, n, displaystyle, n, that, will, hit, the, area, s, displaystyle, s, when, the, time, t, displaystyle, t, elapses, is, n, v, t, s, 6, v, displaystyle, nvts, 6v, when, a, molecule, bounces, off, the, wall, of, the, container, it, changes, its, momentum, p, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 1, to, p, 2, p, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 2, mathbf, p, 1, hence, the, magnitude, of, change, of, the, momentum, of, one, molecule, is, p, 2, p, 1, 2, m, v, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 2, mathbf, p, 1, 2mv, the, magnitude, of, the, change, of, momentum, of, all, molecules, that, bounce, off, the, area, s, displaystyle, s, when, time, t, displaystyle, t, elapses, is, then, p, 2, m, v, n, n, t, s, m, v, 2, 3, v, displaystyle, delta, mathbf, p, 2mvn, ntsmv, 2, 3v, from, f, p, t, displaystyle, f, delta, mathbf, p, t, and, p, 0, f, s, displaystyle, p, 0, f, s, we, get, we, considered, a, situation, where, all, molecules, move, with, the, same, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, now, we, consider, a, situation, where, they, can, move, with, different, velocities, so, we, apply, an, averaging, transformation, to, the, above, equation, effectively, replacing, p, 0, displaystyle, p, 0, by, a, new, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, and, v, 2, displaystyle, v, 2, by, the, arithmetic, mean, of, all, squares, of, all, velocities, of, the, molecules, i, e, by, v, rms, 2, displaystyle, v, text, rms, 2, therefore, which, gives, the, desired, formula, using, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, the, fraction, of, molecules, that, have, a, speed, in, the, range, v, displaystyle, v, to, v, d, v, displaystyle, v, dv, is, f, v, d, v, displaystyle, f, v, dv, where, and, k, displaystyle, k, denotes, the, boltzmann, constant, the, root, mean, square, speed, can, be, calculated, by, using, the, integration, formula, it, follows, that, from, which, we, get, the, ideal, gas, law, let, q, q, x, q, y, q, z, and, p, p, x, p, y, p, z, denote, the, position, vector, and, momentum, vector, of, a, particle, of, an, ideal, gas, respectively, let, f, denote, the, net, force, on, that, particle, then, two, times, the, time, averaged, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, is, where, the, first, equality, is, newton, s, second, law, and, the, second, line, uses, hamilton, s, equations, and, the, equipartition, theorem, summing, over, a, system, of, n, particles, yields, by, newton, s, third, law, and, the, ideal, gas, assumption, the, net, force, of, the, system, is, the, force, applied, by, the, walls, of, the, container, and, this, force, is, given, by, the, pressure, p, of, the, gas, hence, where, d, s, is, the, infinitesimal, area, element, along, the, walls, of, the, container, since, the, divergence, of, the, position, vector, q, is, the, divergence, theorem, implies, that, where, dv, is, an, infinitesimal, volume, within, the, container, and, v, is, the, total, volume, of, the, container, putting, these, equalities, together, yields, which, immediately, implies, the, ideal, gas, law, for, n, particles, where, n, n, n, a, is, the, number, of, moles, of, gas, and, r, n, a, k, b, is, the, gas, constant, for, a, d, dimensional, system, the, ideal, gas, pressure, is, where, l, d, displaystyle, l, d, is, the, volume, of, the, d, dimensional, domain, in, which, the, gas, exists, the, dimensions, of, the, pressure, changes, with, dimensionality
