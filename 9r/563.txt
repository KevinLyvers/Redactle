an, impact, crater, is, a, depression, in, the, surface, of, a, solid, astronomical, body, formed, by, the, hypervelocity, impact, of, a, smaller, object, in, contrast, to, volcanic, craters, which, result, from, explosion, or, internal, collapse, impact, craters, typically, have, raised, rims, and, floors, that, are, lower, in, elevation, than, the, surrounding, terrain, impact, craters, are, typically, circular, though, they, can, be, elliptical, in, shape, or, even, irregular, due, to, events, such, as, landslides, impact, craters, range, in, size, from, microscopic, craters, seen, on, lunar, rocks, returned, by, the, apollo, program, to, simple, bowl, shaped, depressions, and, vast, complex, multi, ringed, impact, basins, meteor, crater, is, a, well, known, example, of, a, small, impact, crater, on, earth, impact, craters, are, the, dominant, geographic, features, on, many, solid, solar, system, objects, including, the, moon, mercury, callisto, ganymede, and, most, small, moons, and, asteroids, on, other, planets, and, moons, that, experience, more, active, surface, geological, processes, such, as, earth, venus, europa, io, titan, and, triton, visible, impact, craters, are, less, common, because, they, become, eroded, buried, or, transformed, by, tectonic, and, volcanic, processes, over, time, where, such, processes, have, destroyed, most, of, the, original, crater, topography, the, terms, impact, structure, or, astrobleme, are, more, commonly, used, in, early, literature, before, the, significance, of, impact, cratering, was, widely, recognised, the, terms, cryptoexplosion, or, cryptovolcanic, structure, were, often, used, to, describe, what, are, now, recognised, as, impact, related, features, on, earth, the, cratering, records, of, very, old, surfaces, such, as, mercury, the, moon, and, the, southern, highlands, of, mars, record, a, period, of, intense, early, bombardment, in, the, inner, solar, system, around, 3, 9, billion, years, ago, the, rate, of, crater, production, on, earth, has, since, been, considerably, lower, but, it, is, appreciable, nonetheless, earth, experiences, on, average, from, one, to, three, impacts, large, enough, to, produce, a, 20, kilometre, diameter, 12, mi, crater, every, million, years, this, indicates, that, there, should, be, far, more, relatively, young, craters, on, the, planet, than, have, been, discovered, so, far, the, cratering, rate, in, the, inner, solar, system, fluctuates, as, a, consequence, of, collisions, in, the, asteroid, belt, that, create, a, family, of, fragments, that, are, often, sent, cascading, into, the, inner, solar, system, formed, in, a, collision, 80, million, years, ago, the, baptistina, family, of, asteroids, is, thought, to, have, caused, a, large, spike, in, the, impact, rate, the, rate, of, impact, cratering, in, the, outer, solar, system, could, be, different, from, the, inner, solar, system, although, earth, s, active, surface, processes, quickly, destroy, the, impact, record, about, 190, terrestrial, impact, craters, have, been, identified, these, range, in, diameter, from, a, few, tens, of, meters, up, to, about, 300, km, 190, mi, and, they, range, in, age, from, recent, times, e, g, the, sikhote, alin, craters, in, russia, whose, creation, was, witnessed, in, 1947, to, more, than, two, billion, years, though, most, are, less, than, 500, million, years, old, because, geological, processes, tend, to, obliterate, older, craters, they, are, also, selectively, found, in, the, stable, interior, regions, of, continents, few, undersea, craters, have, been, discovered, because, of, the, difficulty, of, surveying, the, sea, floor, the, rapid, rate, of, change, of, the, ocean, bottom, and, the, subduction, of, the, ocean, floor, into, earth, s, interior, by, processes, of, plate, tectonics, daniel, m, barringer, a, mining, engineer, was, convinced, already, in, 1903, that, the, crater, he, owned, meteor, crater, was, of, cosmic, origin, most, geologists, at, the, time, assumed, it, formed, as, the, result, of, a, volcanic, steam, eruption, 41, 42, in, the, 1920s, the, american, geologist, walter, h, bucher, studied, a, number, of, sites, now, recognized, as, impact, craters, in, the, united, states, he, concluded, they, had, been, created, by, some, great, explosive, event, but, believed, that, this, force, was, probably, volcanic, in, origin, however, in, 1936, the, geologists, john, d, boon, and, claude, c, albritton, jr, revisited, bucher, s, studies, and, concluded, that, the, craters, that, he, studied, were, probably, formed, by, impacts, grove, karl, gilbert, suggested, in, 1893, that, the, moon, s, craters, were, formed, by, large, asteroid, impacts, ralph, baldwin, in, 1949, wrote, that, the, moon, s, craters, were, mostly, of, impact, origin, around, 1960, gene, shoemaker, revived, the, idea, according, to, david, h, levy, shoemaker, saw, the, craters, on, the, moon, as, logical, impact, sites, that, were, formed, not, gradually, in, eons, but, explosively, in, seconds, for, his, phd, degree, at, princeton, university, 1960, under, the, guidance, of, harry, hammond, hess, shoemaker, studied, the, impact, dynamics, of, meteor, crater, shoemaker, noted, that, meteor, crater, had, the, same, form, and, structure, as, two, explosion, craters, created, from, atomic, bomb, tests, at, the, nevada, test, site, notably, jangle, u, in, 1951, and, teapot, ess, in, 1955, in, 1960, edward, c, t, chao, and, shoemaker, identified, coesite, a, form, of, silicon, dioxide, at, meteor, crater, proving, the, crater, was, formed, from, an, impact, generating, extremely, high, temperatures, and, pressures, they, followed, this, discovery, with, the, identification, of, coesite, within, suevite, at, n, rdlinger, ries, proving, its, impact, origin, armed, with, the, knowledge, of, shock, metamorphic, features, carlyle, s, beals, and, colleagues, at, the, dominion, astrophysical, observatory, in, victoria, british, columbia, canada, and, wolf, von, engelhardt, of, the, university, of, t, bingen, in, germany, began, a, methodical, search, for, impact, craters, by, 1970, they, had, tentatively, identified, more, than, 50, although, their, work, was, controversial, the, american, apollo, moon, landings, which, were, in, progress, at, the, time, provided, supportive, evidence, by, recognizing, the, rate, of, impact, cratering, on, the, moon, because, the, processes, of, erosion, on, the, moon, are, minimal, craters, persist, since, the, earth, could, be, expected, to, have, roughly, the, same, cratering, rate, as, the, moon, it, became, clear, that, the, earth, had, suffered, far, more, impacts, than, could, be, seen, by, counting, evident, craters, impact, cratering, involves, high, velocity, collisions, between, solid, objects, typically, much, greater, than, the, speed, of, sound, in, those, objects, such, hyper, velocity, impacts, produce, physical, effects, such, as, melting, and, vaporization, that, do, not, occur, in, familiar, sub, sonic, collisions, on, earth, ignoring, the, slowing, effects, of, travel, through, the, atmosphere, the, lowest, impact, velocity, with, an, object, from, space, is, equal, to, the, gravitational, escape, velocity, of, about, 11, km, s, the, fastest, impacts, occur, at, about, 72, km, s, in, the, worst, case, scenario, in, which, an, object, in, a, retrograde, near, parabolic, orbit, hits, earth, the, median, impact, velocity, on, earth, is, about, 20, km, s, however, the, slowing, effects, of, travel, through, the, atmosphere, rapidly, decelerate, any, potential, impactor, especially, in, the, lowest, 12, kilometres, where, 90, of, the, earth, s, atmospheric, mass, lies, meteorites, of, up, to, 7, 000, kg, lose, all, their, cosmic, velocity, due, to, atmospheric, drag, at, a, certain, altitude, retardation, point, and, start, to, accelerate, again, due, to, earth, s, gravity, until, the, body, reaches, its, terminal, velocity, of, 0, 09, to, 0, 16, km, s, the, larger, the, meteoroid, i, e, asteroids, and, comets, the, more, of, its, initial, cosmic, velocity, it, preserves, while, an, object, of, 9, 000, kg, maintains, about, 6, of, its, original, velocity, one, of, 900, 000, kg, already, preserves, about, 70, extremely, large, bodies, about, 100, 000, tonnes, are, not, slowed, by, the, atmosphere, at, all, and, impact, with, their, initial, cosmic, velocity, if, no, prior, disintegration, occurs, impacts, at, these, high, speeds, produce, shock, waves, in, solid, materials, and, both, impactor, and, the, material, impacted, are, rapidly, compressed, to, high, density, following, initial, compression, the, high, density, over, compressed, region, rapidly, depressurizes, exploding, violently, to, set, in, train, the, sequence, of, events, that, produces, the, impact, crater, impact, crater, formation, is, therefore, more, closely, analogous, to, cratering, by, high, explosives, than, by, mechanical, displacement, indeed, the, energy, density, of, some, material, involved, in, the, formation, of, impact, craters, is, many, times, higher, than, that, generated, by, high, explosives, since, craters, are, caused, by, explosions, they, are, nearly, always, circular, only, very, low, angle, impacts, cause, significantly, elliptical, craters, this, describes, impacts, on, solid, surfaces, impacts, on, porous, surfaces, such, as, that, of, hyperion, may, produce, internal, compression, without, ejecta, punching, a, hole, in, the, surface, without, filling, in, nearby, craters, this, may, explain, the, sponge, like, appearance, of, that, moon, it, is, convenient, to, divide, the, impact, process, conceptually, into, three, distinct, stages, 1, initial, contact, and, compression, 2, excavation, 3, modification, and, collapse, in, practice, there, is, overlap, between, the, three, processes, with, for, example, the, excavation, of, the, crater, continuing, in, some, regions, while, modification, and, collapse, is, already, underway, in, others, in, the, absence, of, atmosphere, the, impact, process, begins, when, the, impactor, first, touches, the, target, surface, this, contact, accelerates, the, target, and, decelerates, the, impactor, because, the, impactor, is, moving, so, rapidly, the, rear, of, the, object, moves, a, significant, distance, during, the, short, but, finite, time, taken, for, the, deceleration, to, propagate, across, the, impactor, as, a, result, the, impactor, is, compressed, its, density, rises, and, the, pressure, within, it, increases, dramatically, peak, pressures, in, large, impacts, exceed, 1, t, pa, to, reach, values, more, usually, found, deep, in, the, interiors, of, planets, or, generated, artificially, in, nuclear, explosions, in, physical, terms, a, shock, wave, originates, from, the, point, of, contact, as, this, shock, wave, expands, it, decelerates, and, compresses, the, impactor, and, it, accelerates, and, compresses, the, target, stress, levels, within, the, shock, wave, far, exceed, the, strength, of, solid, materials, consequently, both, the, impactor, and, the, target, close, to, the, impact, site, are, irreversibly, damaged, many, crystalline, minerals, can, be, transformed, into, higher, density, phases, by, shock, waves, for, example, the, common, mineral, quartz, can, be, transformed, into, the, higher, pressure, forms, coesite, and, stishovite, many, other, shock, related, changes, take, place, within, both, impactor, and, target, as, the, shock, wave, passes, through, and, some, of, these, changes, can, be, used, as, diagnostic, tools, to, determine, whether, particular, geological, features, were, produced, by, impact, cratering, as, the, shock, wave, decays, the, shocked, region, decompresses, towards, more, usual, pressures, and, densities, the, damage, produced, by, the, shock, wave, raises, the, temperature, of, the, material, in, all, but, the, smallest, impacts, this, increase, in, temperature, is, sufficient, to, melt, the, impactor, and, in, larger, impacts, to, vaporize, most, of, it, and, to, melt, large, volumes, of, the, target, as, well, as, being, heated, the, target, near, the, impact, is, accelerated, by, the, shock, wave, and, it, continues, moving, away, from, the, impact, behind, the, decaying, shock, wave, contact, compression, decompression, and, the, passage, of, the, shock, wave, all, occur, within, a, few, tenths, of, a, second, for, a, large, impact, the, subsequent, excavation, of, the, crater, occurs, more, slowly, and, during, this, stage, the, flow, of, material, is, largely, subsonic, during, excavation, the, crater, grows, as, the, accelerated, target, material, moves, away, from, the, point, of, impact, the, target, s, motion, is, initially, downwards, and, outwards, but, it, becomes, outwards, and, upwards, the, flow, initially, produces, an, approximately, hemispherical, cavity, that, continues, to, grow, eventually, producing, a, paraboloid, bowl, shaped, crater, in, which, the, centre, has, been, pushed, down, a, significant, volume, of, material, has, been, ejected, and, a, topographically, elevated, crater, rim, has, been, pushed, up, when, this, cavity, has, reached, its, maximum, size, it, is, called, the, transient, cavity, the, depth, of, the, transient, cavity, is, typically, a, quarter, to, a, third, of, its, diameter, ejecta, thrown, out, of, the, crater, do, not, include, material, excavated, from, the, full, depth, of, the, transient, cavity, typically, the, depth, of, maximum, excavation, is, only, about, a, third, of, the, total, depth, as, a, result, about, one, third, of, the, volume, of, the, transient, crater, is, formed, by, the, ejection, of, material, and, the, remaining, two, thirds, is, formed, by, the, displacement, of, material, downwards, outwards, and, upwards, to, form, the, elevated, rim, for, impacts, into, highly, porous, materials, a, significant, crater, volume, may, also, be, formed, by, the, permanent, compaction, of, the, pore, space, such, compaction, craters, may, be, important, on, many, asteroids, comets, and, small, moons, in, large, impacts, as, well, as, material, displaced, and, ejected, to, form, the, crater, significant, volumes, of, target, material, may, be, melted, and, vaporized, together, with, the, original, impactor, some, of, this, impact, melt, rock, may, be, ejected, but, most, of, it, remains, within, the, transient, crater, initially, forming, a, layer, of, impact, melt, coating, the, interior, of, the, transient, cavity, in, contrast, the, hot, dense, vaporized, material, expands, rapidly, out, of, the, growing, cavity, carrying, some, solid, and, molten, material, within, it, as, it, does, so, as, this, hot, vapor, cloud, expands, it, rises, and, cools, much, like, the, archetypal, mushroom, cloud, generated, by, large, nuclear, explosions, in, large, impacts, the, expanding, vapor, cloud, may, rise, to, many, times, the, scale, height, of, the, atmosphere, effectively, expanding, into, free, space, most, material, ejected, from, the, crater, is, deposited, within, a, few, crater, radii, but, a, small, fraction, may, travel, large, distances, at, high, velocity, and, in, large, impacts, it, may, exceed, escape, velocity, and, leave, the, impacted, planet, or, moon, entirely, the, majority, of, the, fastest, material, is, ejected, from, close, to, the, center, of, impact, and, the, slowest, material, is, ejected, close, to, the, rim, at, low, velocities, to, form, an, overturned, coherent, flap, of, ejecta, immediately, outside, the, rim, as, ejecta, escapes, from, the, growing, crater, it, forms, an, expanding, curtain, in, the, shape, of, an, inverted, cone, the, trajectory, of, individual, particles, within, the, curtain, is, thought, to, be, largely, ballistic, small, volumes, of, un, melted, and, relatively, un, shocked, material, may, be, spalled, at, very, high, relative, velocities, from, the, surface, of, the, target, and, from, the, rear, of, the, impactor, spalling, provides, a, potential, mechanism, whereby, material, may, be, ejected, into, inter, planetary, space, largely, undamaged, and, whereby, small, volumes, of, the, impactor, may, be, preserved, undamaged, even, in, large, impacts, small, volumes, of, high, speed, material, may, also, be, generated, early, in, the, impact, by, jetting, this, occurs, when, two, surfaces, converge, rapidly, and, obliquely, at, a, small, angle, and, high, temperature, highly, shocked, material, is, expelled, from, the, convergence, zone, with, velocities, that, may, be, several, times, larger, than, the, impact, velocity, in, most, circumstances, the, transient, cavity, is, not, stable, and, collapses, under, gravity, in, small, craters, less, than, about, 4, km, diameter, on, earth, there, is, some, limited, collapse, of, the, crater, rim, coupled, with, debris, sliding, down, the, crater, walls, and, drainage, of, impact, melts, into, the, deeper, cavity, the, resultant, structure, is, called, a, simple, crater, and, it, remains, bowl, shaped, and, superficially, similar, to, the, transient, crater, in, simple, craters, the, original, excavation, cavity, is, overlain, by, a, lens, of, collapse, breccia, ejecta, and, melt, rock, and, a, portion, of, the, central, crater, floor, may, sometimes, be, flat, above, a, certain, threshold, size, which, varies, with, planetary, gravity, the, collapse, and, modification, of, the, transient, cavity, is, much, more, extensive, and, the, resulting, structure, is, called, a, complex, crater, the, collapse, of, the, transient, cavity, is, driven, by, gravity, and, involves, both, the, uplift, of, the, central, region, and, the, inward, collapse, of, the, rim, the, central, uplift, is, not, the, result, of, elastic, rebound, which, is, a, process, in, which, a, material, with, elastic, strength, attempts, to, return, to, its, original, geometry, rather, the, collapse, is, a, process, in, which, a, material, with, little, or, no, strength, attempts, to, return, to, a, state, of, gravitational, equilibrium, complex, craters, have, uplifted, centers, and, they, have, typically, broad, flat, shallow, crater, floors, and, terraced, walls, at, the, largest, sizes, one, or, more, exterior, or, interior, rings, may, appear, and, the, structure, may, be, labeled, an, impact, basin, rather, than, an, impact, crater, complex, crater, morphology, on, rocky, planets, appears, to, follow, a, regular, sequence, with, increasing, size, small, complex, craters, with, a, central, topographic, peak, are, called, central, peak, craters, for, example, tycho, intermediate, sized, craters, in, which, the, central, peak, is, replaced, by, a, ring, of, peaks, are, called, peak, ring, craters, for, example, schr, dinger, and, the, largest, craters, contain, multiple, concentric, topographic, rings, and, are, called, multi, ringed, basins, for, example, orientale, on, icy, as, opposed, to, rocky, bodies, other, morphological, forms, appear, that, may, have, central, pits, rather, than, central, peaks, and, at, the, largest, sizes, may, contain, many, concentric, rings, valhalla, on, callisto, is, an, example, of, this, type, long, after, an, impact, event, a, crater, may, be, further, modified, by, erosion, mass, wasting, processes, viscous, relaxation, or, erased, entirely, these, effects, are, most, prominent, on, geologically, and, meteorologically, active, bodies, such, as, earth, titan, triton, and, io, however, heavily, modified, craters, may, be, found, on, more, primordial, bodies, such, as, callisto, where, many, ancient, craters, flatten, into, bright, ghost, craters, or, palimpsests, non, explosive, volcanic, craters, can, usually, be, distinguished, from, impact, craters, by, their, irregular, shape, and, the, association, of, volcanic, flows, and, other, volcanic, materials, impact, craters, produce, melted, rocks, as, well, but, usually, in, smaller, volumes, with, different, characteristics, the, distinctive, mark, of, an, impact, crater, is, the, presence, of, rock, that, has, undergone, shock, metamorphic, effects, such, as, shatter, cones, melted, rocks, and, crystal, deformations, the, problem, is, that, these, materials, tend, to, be, deeply, buried, at, least, for, simple, craters, they, tend, to, be, revealed, in, the, uplifted, center, of, a, complex, crater, however, impacts, produce, distinctive, shock, metamorphic, effects, that, allow, impact, sites, to, be, distinctively, identified, such, shock, metamorphic, effects, can, include, on, earth, impact, craters, have, resulted, in, useful, minerals, some, of, the, ores, produced, from, impact, related, effects, on, earth, include, ores, of, iron, uranium, gold, copper, and, nickel, it, is, estimated, that, the, value, of, materials, mined, from, impact, structures, is, five, billion, dollars, year, just, for, north, america, the, eventual, usefulness, of, impact, craters, depends, on, several, factors, especially, the, nature, of, the, materials, that, were, impacted, and, when, the, materials, were, affected, in, some, cases, the, deposits, were, already, in, place, and, the, impact, brought, them, to, the, surface, these, are, called, progenetic, economic, deposits, others, were, created, during, the, actual, impact, the, great, energy, involved, caused, melting, useful, minerals, formed, as, a, result, of, this, energy, are, classified, as, syngenetic, deposits, the, third, type, called, epigenetic, deposits, is, caused, by, the, creation, of, a, basin, from, the, impact, many, of, the, minerals, that, our, modern, lives, depend, on, are, associated, with, impacts, in, the, past, the, vredeford, dome, in, the, center, of, the, witwatersrand, basin, is, the, largest, goldfield, in, the, world, which, has, supplied, about, 40, of, all, the, gold, ever, mined, in, an, impact, structure, though, the, gold, did, not, come, from, the, bolide, the, asteroid, that, struck, the, region, was, 9, 7, km, 6, mi, wide, the, sudbury, basin, was, caused, by, an, impacting, body, over, 9, 7, km, 6, mi, in, diameter, this, basin, is, famous, for, its, deposits, of, nickel, copper, and, platinum, group, elements, an, impact, was, involved, in, making, the, carswell, structure, in, saskatchewan, canada, it, contains, uranium, deposits, hydrocarbons, are, common, around, impact, structures, fifty, percent, of, impact, structures, in, north, america, in, hydrocarbon, bearing, sedimentary, basins, contain, oil, gas, fields, on, earth, the, recognition, of, impact, craters, is, a, branch, of, geology, and, is, related, to, planetary, geology, in, the, study, of, other, worlds, out, of, many, proposed, craters, relatively, few, are, confirmed, the, following, twenty, are, a, sample, of, articles, of, confirmed, and, well, documented, impact, sites, see, the, earth, impact, database, a, website, concerned, with, 190, as, of, july, 2019, scientifically, confirmed, impact, craters, on, earth, there, are, approximately, twelve, more, impact, craters, basins, larger, than, 300, km, on, the, moon, five, on, mercury, and, four, on, mars, large, basins, some, unnamed, but, mostly, smaller, than, 300, km, can, also, be, found, on, saturn, s, moons, dione, rhea, and, iapetus
