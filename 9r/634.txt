in, geography, and, geology, a, cliff, is, an, area, of, rock, which, has, a, general, angle, defined, by, the, vertical, or, nearly, vertical, cliffs, are, formed, by, the, processes, of, weathering, and, erosion, with, the, effect, of, gravity, cliffs, are, common, on, coasts, in, mountainous, areas, escarpments, and, along, rivers, cliffs, are, usually, composed, of, rock, that, is, resistant, to, weathering, and, erosion, the, sedimentary, rocks, that, are, most, likely, to, form, cliffs, include, sandstone, limestone, chalk, and, dolomite, igneous, rocks, such, as, granite, and, basalt, also, often, form, cliffs, an, escarpment, or, scarp, is, a, type, of, cliff, formed, by, the, movement, of, a, geologic, fault, a, landslide, or, sometimes, by, rock, slides, or, falling, rocks, which, change, the, differential, erosion, of, the, rock, layers, most, cliffs, have, some, form, of, scree, slope, at, their, base, in, arid, areas, or, under, high, cliffs, they, are, generally, exposed, jumbles, of, fallen, rock, in, areas, of, higher, moisture, a, soil, slope, may, obscure, the, talus, many, cliffs, also, feature, tributary, waterfalls, or, rock, shelters, sometimes, a, cliff, peters, out, at, the, end, of, a, ridge, with, mushroom, rocks, or, other, types, of, rock, columns, remaining, coastal, erosion, may, lead, to, the, formation, of, sea, cliffs, along, a, receding, coastline, the, british, ordnance, survey, distinguishes, between, around, most, cliffs, continuous, line, along, the, topper, edge, with, projections, down, the, face, and, outcrops, continuous, lines, along, lower, edge, cliff, comes, from, the, old, english, word, clif, of, essentially, the, same, meaning, cognate, with, dutch, low, german, and, old, norse, klif, cliff, these, may, in, turn, all, be, from, a, romance, loanword, into, primitive, germanic, that, has, its, origins, in, the, latin, forms, clivus, clevus, slope, or, hillside, given, that, a, cliff, does, not, need, to, be, exactly, vertical, there, can, be, ambiguity, about, whether, a, given, slope, is, a, cliff, or, not, and, also, about, how, much, of, a, certain, slope, to, count, as, a, cliff, for, example, given, a, truly, vertical, rock, wall, above, a, very, steep, slope, one, could, count, just, the, rock, wall, or, the, combination, listings, of, cliffs, are, thus, inherently, uncertain, some, of, the, largest, cliffs, on, earth, are, found, underwater, for, example, an, 8, 000, m, drop, over, a, 4, 250, m, span, can, be, found, at, a, ridge, sitting, inside, the, kermadec, trench, according, to, some, sources, the, highest, cliff, in, the, world, about, 1, 340, m, high, is, the, east, face, of, great, trango, in, the, karakoram, mountains, of, northern, pakistan, this, uses, a, fairly, stringent, notion, of, cliff, as, the, 1, 340, m, figure, refers, to, a, nearly, vertical, headwall, of, two, stacked, pillars, adding, in, a, very, steep, approach, brings, the, total, drop, from, the, east, face, precipice, to, the, nearby, dunge, glacier, to, nearly, 2, 000, m, the, location, of, the, world, s, highest, sea, cliffs, depends, also, on, the, definition, of, cliff, that, is, used, guinness, world, records, states, it, is, kalaupapa, hawaii, at, 1, 010, m, high, another, contender, is, the, north, face, of, mitre, peak, which, drops, 1, 683, m, to, milford, sound, new, zealand, these, are, subject, to, a, less, stringent, definition, as, the, average, slope, of, these, cliffs, at, kaulapapa, is, about, 1, 7, corresponding, to, an, angle, of, 60, degrees, and, mitre, peak, is, similar, a, more, vertical, drop, into, the, sea, can, be, found, at, maujit, qaqarssuasia, also, known, as, the, thumbnail, which, is, situated, in, the, torssuk, tak, fjord, area, at, the, very, tip, of, south, greenland, and, drops, 1, 560, m, near, vertically, considering, a, truly, vertical, drop, mount, thor, on, baffin, island, in, arctic, canada, is, often, considered, the, highest, at, 1370, m, 4500, ft, high, in, total, the, top, 480, m, 1600, ft, is, overhanging, and, is, said, to, give, it, the, longest, vertical, drop, on, earth, at, 1, 250, m, 4, 100, ft, however, other, cliffs, on, baffin, island, such, as, polar, sun, spire, in, the, sam, ford, fjord, or, others, in, remote, areas, of, greenland, may, be, higher, the, highest, cliff, in, the, solar, system, may, be, verona, rupes, an, approximately, 20, km, 12, mi, high, fault, scarp, on, miranda, a, moon, of, uranus, the, following, is, an, incomplete, list, of, cliffs, of, the, world, above, sea, above, land, several, big, granite, faces, in, the, arctic, region, vie, for, the, title, of, highest, vertical, drop, on, earth, but, reliable, measurements, are, not, always, available, the, possible, contenders, include, measurements, are, approximate, mount, thor, baffin, island, canada, 1, 370, m, 4, 500, ft, total, top, 480, m, 1600, ft, is, overhanging, this, is, commonly, regarded, as, being, the, largest, vertical, drop, on, earth, ot, leapyear, at, 1, 250, m, 4, 100, ft, of, baffin, island, rises, 4, 300, ft, above, the, flat, frozen, fjord, although, the, lower, portion, of, the, face, breaks, from, the, vertical, wall, with, a, series, of, ledges, and, buttresses, other, notable, cliffs, include, above, sea, above, land, above, sea, above, land, submarine, above, sea, above, land, cliff, landforms, provide, unique, habitat, niches, to, a, variety, of, plants, and, animals, whose, preferences, and, needs, are, suited, by, the, vertical, geometry, of, this, landform, type, for, example, a, number, of, birds, have, decided, affinities, for, choosing, cliff, locations, for, nesting, often, driven, by, the, defensibility, of, these, locations, as, well, as, absence, of, certain, predators, humans, have, also, inhabited, cliff, dwellings, the, population, of, the, rare, borderea, chouardii, during, 2012, existed, only, on, two, cliff, habitats, within, western,
