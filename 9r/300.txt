catalysis, k, t, l, s, s, is, the, increase, in, rate, of, a, chemical, reaction, due, to, an, added, substance, known, as, a, catalyst, k, t, l, s, t, catalysts, are, not, consumed, by, the, reaction, and, remain, unchanged, after, it, if, the, reaction, is, rapid, and, the, catalyst, recycles, quickly, very, small, amounts, of, catalyst, often, suffice, mixing, surface, area, and, temperature, are, important, factors, in, reaction, rate, catalysts, generally, react, with, one, or, more, reactants, to, form, intermediates, that, subsequently, give, the, final, reaction, product, in, the, process, of, regenerating, the, catalyst, the, rate, increase, occurs, because, the, catalyst, allows, the, reaction, to, occur, by, an, alternative, mechanism, which, may, be, much, faster, than, the, non, catalyzed, mechanism, however, the, non, catalyzed, mechanism, does, remain, possible, so, that, the, total, rate, catalyzed, plus, non, catalyzed, can, only, increase, in, the, presence, of, the, catalyst, and, never, decrease, catalysis, may, be, classified, as, either, homogeneous, whose, components, are, dispersed, in, the, same, phase, usually, gaseous, or, liquid, as, the, reactant, or, heterogeneous, whose, components, are, not, in, the, same, phase, enzymes, and, other, biocatalysts, are, often, considered, as, a, third, category, catalysis, is, ubiquitous, in, chemical, industry, of, all, kinds, estimates, are, that, 90, of, all, commercially, produced, chemical, products, involve, catalysts, at, some, stage, in, the, process, of, their, manufacture, the, term, catalyst, is, derived, from, greek, kataluein, meaning, loosen, or, untie, the, concept, of, catalysis, was, invented, by, chemist, elizabeth, fulhame, based, on, her, novel, work, in, oxidation, reduction, experiments, an, illustrative, example, is, the, effect, of, catalysts, to, speed, the, decomposition, of, hydrogen, peroxide, into, water, and, oxygen, this, reaction, proceeds, because, the, reaction, products, are, more, stable, than, the, starting, compound, but, this, decomposition, is, so, slow, that, hydrogen, peroxide, solutions, are, commercially, available, in, the, presence, of, a, catalyst, such, as, manganese, dioxide, this, reaction, proceeds, much, more, rapidly, this, effect, is, readily, seen, by, the, effervescence, of, oxygen, the, catalyst, is, not, consumed, in, the, reaction, and, may, be, recovered, unchanged, and, re, used, indefinitely, accordingly, manganese, dioxide, is, said, to, catalyze, this, reaction, in, living, organisms, this, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, enzymes, proteins, that, serve, as, catalysts, such, as, catalase, another, example, is, the, effect, of, catalysts, on, air, pollution, and, reducing, the, amount, of, carbon, monoxide, development, of, active, and, selective, catalysts, for, the, conversion, of, carbon, monoxide, into, desirable, products, is, one, of, the, most, important, roles, of, catalysts, using, catalysts, for, hydrogenation, of, carbon, monoxide, helps, to, remove, this, toxic, gas, and, also, attain, useful, materials, the, si, derived, unit, for, measuring, the, catalytic, activity, of, a, catalyst, is, the, katal, which, is, quantified, in, moles, per, second, the, productivity, of, a, catalyst, can, be, described, by, the, turnover, number, or, ton, and, the, catalytic, activity, by, the, turn, over, frequency, tof, which, is, the, ton, per, time, unit, the, biochemical, equivalent, is, the, enzyme, unit, for, more, information, on, the, efficiency, of, enzymatic, catalysis, see, the, article, on, enzymes, in, general, chemical, reactions, occur, faster, in, the, presence, of, a, catalyst, because, the, catalyst, provides, an, alternative, reaction, mechanism, reaction, pathway, having, a, lower, activation, energy, than, the, non, catalyzed, mechanism, in, catalyzed, mechanisms, the, catalyst, is, regenerated, as, a, simple, example, occurring, in, the, gas, phase, the, reaction, 2, so, 2, o, 2, 2, so, 3, can, be, catalyzed, by, adding, nitric, oxide, the, reaction, occurs, in, two, steps, the, no, catalyst, is, regenerated, the, overall, rate, is, the, rate, of, the, slow, step, an, example, of, heterogeneous, catalysis, is, the, reaction, of, oxygen, and, hydrogen, on, the, surface, of, titanium, dioxide, tio, 2, or, titania, to, produce, water, scanning, tunneling, microscopy, showed, that, the, molecules, undergo, adsorption, and, dissociation, the, dissociated, surface, bound, o, and, h, atoms, diffuse, together, the, intermediate, reaction, states, are, ho, 2, h, 2, o, 2, then, h, 3, o, 2, and, the, reaction, product, water, molecule, dimers, after, which, the, water, molecule, desorbs, from, the, catalyst, surface, catalysts, enable, pathways, that, differ, from, the, uncatalyzed, reactions, these, pathways, have, lower, activation, energy, consequently, more, molecular, collisions, have, the, energy, needed, to, reach, the, transition, state, hence, catalysts, can, enable, reactions, that, would, otherwise, be, blocked, or, slowed, by, a, kinetic, barrier, the, catalyst, may, increase, the, reaction, rate, or, selectivity, or, enable, the, reaction, at, lower, temperatures, this, effect, can, be, illustrated, with, an, energy, profile, diagram, in, the, catalyzed, elementary, reaction, catalysts, do, not, change, the, extent, of, a, reaction, they, have, no, effect, on, the, chemical, equilibrium, of, a, reaction, the, ratio, of, the, forward, and, the, reverse, reaction, rates, is, unaffected, see, also, thermodynamics, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, describes, why, a, catalyst, does, not, change, the, chemical, equilibrium, of, a, reaction, suppose, there, was, such, a, catalyst, that, shifted, an, equilibrium, introducing, the, catalyst, to, the, system, would, result, in, a, reaction, to, move, to, the, new, equilibrium, producing, energy, production, of, energy, is, a, necessary, result, since, reactions, are, spontaneous, only, if, gibbs, free, energy, is, produced, and, if, there, is, no, energy, barrier, there, is, no, need, for, a, catalyst, then, removing, the, catalyst, would, also, result, in, a, reaction, producing, energy, i, e, the, addition, and, its, reverse, process, removal, would, both, produce, energy, thus, a, catalyst, that, could, change, the, equilibrium, would, be, a, perpetual, motion, machine, a, contradiction, to, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, thus, catalysts, do, not, alter, the, equilibrium, constant, a, catalyst, can, however, change, the, equilibrium, concentrations, by, reacting, in, a, subsequent, step, it, is, then, consumed, as, the, reaction, proceeds, and, thus, it, is, also, a, reactant, illustrative, is, the, base, catalyzed, hydrolysis, of, esters, where, the, produced, carboxylic, acid, immediately, reacts, with, the, base, catalyst, and, thus, the, reaction, equilibrium, is, shifted, towards, hydrolysis, the, catalyst, stabilizes, the, transition, state, more, than, it, stabilizes, the, starting, material, it, decreases, the, kinetic, barrier, by, decreasing, the, difference, in, energy, between, starting, material, and, the, transition, state, it, does, not, change, the, energy, difference, between, starting, materials, and, products, thermodynamic, barrier, or, the, available, energy, this, is, provided, by, the, environment, as, heat, or, light, some, so, called, catalysts, are, really, precatalysts, precatalysts, convert, to, catalysts, in, the, reaction, for, example, wilkinson, s, catalyst, rhcl, pph, 3, 3, loses, one, triphenylphosphine, ligand, before, entering, the, true, catalytic, cycle, precatalysts, are, easier, to, store, but, are, easily, activated, in, situ, because, of, this, preactivation, step, many, catalytic, reactions, involve, an, induction, period, in, cooperative, catalysis, chemical, species, that, improve, catalytic, activity, are, called, cocatalysts, or, promoters, in, tandem, catalysis, two, or, more, different, catalysts, are, coupled, in, a, one, pot, reaction, in, autocatalysis, the, catalyst, is, a, product, of, the, overall, reaction, in, contrast, to, all, other, types, of, catalysis, considered, in, this, article, the, simplest, example, of, autocatalysis, is, a, reaction, of, type, a, b, 2, b, in, one, or, in, several, steps, the, overall, reaction, is, just, a, b, so, that, b, is, a, product, but, since, b, is, also, a, reactant, it, may, be, present, in, the, rate, equation, and, affect, the, reaction, rate, as, the, reaction, proceeds, the, concentration, of, b, increases, and, can, accelerate, the, reaction, as, a, catalyst, in, effect, the, reaction, accelerates, itself, or, is, autocatalyzed, an, example, is, the, hydrolysis, of, an, ester, such, as, aspirin, to, a, carboxylic, acid, and, an, alcohol, in, the, absence, of, added, acid, catalysts, the, carboxylic, acid, product, catalyzes, the, hydrolysis, switchable, catalysis, refers, to, a, type, of, catalysis, where, the, catalyst, can, be, toggled, between, different, ground, states, possessing, distinct, reactivity, typically, by, applying, an, external, stimulus, this, ability, to, reversibly, switch, the, catalyst, allows, for, spatiotemporal, control, over, catalytic, activity, and, selectivity, the, external, stimuli, used, to, switch, the, catalyst, can, include, changes, in, temperature, ph, light, electric, fields, or, the, addition, of, chemical, agents, a, true, catalyst, can, work, in, tandem, with, a, sacrificial, catalyst, the, true, catalyst, is, consumed, in, the, elementary, reaction, and, turned, into, a, deactivated, form, the, sacrificial, catalyst, regenerates, the, true, catalyst, for, another, cycle, the, sacrificial, catalyst, is, consumed, in, the, reaction, and, as, such, it, is, not, really, a, catalyst, but, a, reagent, for, example, osmium, tetroxide, oso, 4, is, a, good, reagent, for, dihydroxylation, but, it, is, highly, toxic, and, expensive, in, upjohn, dihydroxylation, the, sacrificial, catalyst, n, methylmorpholine, n, oxide, nmmo, regenerates, oso, 4, and, only, catalytic, quantities, of, oso, 4, are, needed, catalysis, may, be, classified, as, either, homogeneous, or, heterogeneous, a, homogeneous, catalysis, is, one, whose, components, are, dispersed, in, the, same, phase, usually, gaseous, or, liquid, as, the, reactant, s, molecules, a, heterogeneous, catalysis, is, one, where, the, reaction, components, are, not, in, the, same, phase, enzymes, and, other, biocatalysts, are, often, considered, as, a, third, category, similar, mechanistic, principles, apply, to, heterogeneous, homogeneous, and, biocatalysis, heterogeneous, catalysts, act, in, a, different, phase, than, the, reactants, most, heterogeneous, catalysts, are, solids, that, act, on, substrates, in, a, liquid, or, gaseous, reaction, mixture, important, heterogeneous, catalysts, include, zeolites, alumina, higher, order, oxides, graphitic, carbon, transition, metal, oxides, metals, such, as, raney, nickel, for, hydrogenation, and, vanadium, v, oxide, for, oxidation, of, sulfur, dioxide, into, sulfur, trioxide, by, the, contact, process, diverse, mechanisms, for, reactions, on, surfaces, are, known, depending, on, how, the, adsorption, takes, place, langmuir, hinshelwood, eley, rideal, and, mars, van, krevelen, the, total, surface, area, of, a, solid, has, an, important, effect, on, the, reaction, rate, the, smaller, the, catalyst, particle, size, the, larger, the, surface, area, for, a, given, mass, of, particles, a, heterogeneous, catalyst, has, active, sites, which, are, the, atoms, or, crystal, faces, where, the, substrate, actually, binds, active, sites, are, atoms, but, are, often, described, as, a, facet, edge, surface, step, etc, of, a, solid, most, of, the, volume, but, also, most, of, the, surface, of, a, heterogeneous, catalyst, may, be, catalytically, inactive, finding, out, the, nature, of, the, active, site, is, technically, challenging, for, example, the, catalyst, for, the, haber, process, for, the, synthesis, of, ammonia, from, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, is, often, described, as, iron, but, detailed, studies, and, many, optimizations, have, led, to, catalysts, that, are, mixtures, of, iron, potassium, calcium, aluminum, oxide, the, reacting, gases, adsorb, onto, active, sites, on, the, iron, particles, once, physically, adsorbed, the, reagents, partially, or, wholly, dissociate, and, form, new, bonds, in, this, way, the, particularly, strong, triple, bond, in, nitrogen, is, broken, which, would, be, extremely, uncommon, in, the, gas, phase, due, to, its, high, activation, energy, thus, the, activation, energy, of, the, overall, reaction, is, lowered, and, the, rate, of, reaction, increases, another, place, where, a, heterogeneous, catalyst, is, applied, is, in, the, oxidation, of, sulfur, dioxide, on, vanadium, v, oxide, for, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, many, heterogeneous, catalysts, are, in, fact, nanomaterials, heterogeneous, catalysts, are, typically, supported, which, means, that, the, catalyst, is, dispersed, on, a, second, material, that, enhances, the, effectiveness, or, minimizes, its, cost, supports, prevent, or, minimize, agglomeration, and, sintering, of, small, catalyst, particles, exposing, more, surface, area, thus, catalysts, have, a, higher, specific, activity, per, gram, on, support, sometimes, the, support, is, merely, a, surface, on, which, the, catalyst, is, spread, to, increase, the, surface, area, more, often, the, support, and, the, catalyst, interact, affecting, the, catalytic, reaction, supports, can, also, be, used, in, nanoparticle, synthesis, by, providing, sites, for, individual, molecules, of, catalyst, to, chemically, bind, supports, are, porous, materials, with, a, high, surface, area, most, commonly, alumina, zeolites, or, various, kinds, of, activated, carbon, specialized, supports, include, silicon, dioxide, titanium, dioxide, calcium, carbonate, and, barium, sulfate, in, the, context, of, electrochemistry, specifically, in, fuel, cell, engineering, various, metal, containing, catalysts, are, used, to, enhance, the, rates, of, the, half, reactions, that, comprise, the, fuel, cell, one, common, type, of, fuel, cell, electrocatalyst, is, based, upon, nanoparticles, of, platinum, that, are, supported, on, slightly, larger, carbon, particles, when, in, contact, with, one, of, the, electrodes, in, a, fuel, cell, this, platinum, increases, the, rate, of, oxygen, reduction, either, to, water, or, to, hydroxide, or, hydrogen, peroxide, homogeneous, catalysts, function, in, the, same, phase, as, the, reactants, typically, homogeneous, catalysts, are, dissolved, in, a, solvent, with, the, substrates, one, example, of, homogeneous, catalysis, involves, the, influence, of, h, on, the, esterification, of, carboxylic, acids, such, as, the, formation, of, methyl, acetate, from, acetic, acid, and, methanol, high, volume, processes, requiring, a, homogeneous, catalyst, include, hydroformylation, hydrosilylation, hydrocyanation, for, inorganic, chemists, homogeneous, catalysis, is, often, synonymous, with, organometallic, catalysts, many, homogeneous, catalysts, are, however, not, organometallic, illustrated, by, the, use, of, cobalt, salts, that, catalyze, the, oxidation, of, p, xylene, to, terephthalic, acid, whereas, transition, metals, sometimes, attract, most, of, the, attention, in, the, study, of, catalysis, small, organic, molecules, without, metals, can, also, exhibit, catalytic, properties, as, is, apparent, from, the, fact, that, many, enzymes, lack, transition, metals, typically, organic, catalysts, require, a, higher, loading, amount, of, catalyst, per, unit, amount, of, reactant, expressed, in, mol, amount, of, substance, than, transition, metal, ion, based, catalysts, but, these, catalysts, are, usually, commercially, available, in, bulk, helping, to, lower, costs, in, the, early, 2000s, these, organocatalysts, were, considered, new, generation, and, are, competitive, to, traditional, metal, ion, containing, catalysts, organocatalysts, are, supposed, to, operate, akin, to, metal, free, enzymes, utilizing, e, g, non, covalent, interactions, such, as, hydrogen, bonding, the, discipline, organocatalysis, is, divided, into, the, application, of, covalent, e, g, proline, dmap, and, non, covalent, e, g, thiourea, organocatalysis, organocatalysts, referring, to, the, preferred, catalyst, substrate, binding, and, interaction, respectively, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, 2021, was, awarded, jointly, to, benjamin, list, and, david, w, c, macmillan, for, the, development, of, asymmetric, organocatalysis, photocatalysis, is, the, phenomenon, where, the, catalyst, can, receive, light, to, generate, an, excited, state, that, effect, redox, reactions, singlet, oxygen, is, usually, produced, by, photocatalysis, photocatalysts, are, components, of, dye, sensitized, solar, cells, in, biology, enzymes, are, protein, based, catalysts, in, metabolism, and, catabolism, most, biocatalysts, are, enzymes, but, other, non, protein, based, classes, of, biomolecules, also, exhibit, catalytic, properties, including, ribozymes, and, synthetic, deoxyribozymes, biocatalysts, can, be, thought, of, as, an, intermediate, between, homogeneous, and, heterogeneous, catalysts, although, strictly, speaking, soluble, enzymes, are, homogeneous, catalysts, and, membrane, bound, enzymes, are, heterogeneous, several, factors, affect, the, activity, of, enzymes, and, other, catalysts, including, temperature, ph, the, concentration, of, enzymes, substrate, and, products, a, particularly, important, reagent, in, enzymatic, reactions, is, water, which, is, the, product, of, many, bond, forming, reactions, and, a, reactant, in, many, bond, breaking, processes, in, biocatalysis, enzymes, are, employed, to, prepare, many, commodity, chemicals, including, high, fructose, corn, syrup, and, acrylamide, some, monoclonal, antibodies, whose, binding, target, is, a, stable, molecule, that, resembles, the, transition, state, of, a, chemical, reaction, can, function, as, weak, catalysts, for, that, chemical, reaction, by, lowering, its, activation, energy, such, catalytic, antibodies, are, sometimes, called, abzymes, estimates, are, that, 90, of, all, commercially, produced, chemical, products, involve, catalysts, at, some, stage, in, the, process, of, their, manufacture, in, 2005, catalytic, processes, generated, about, 900, billion, in, products, worldwide, catalysis, is, so, pervasive, that, subareas, are, not, readily, classified, some, areas, of, particular, concentration, are, surveyed, below, petroleum, refining, makes, intensive, use, of, catalysis, for, alkylation, catalytic, cracking, breaking, long, chain, hydrocarbons, into, smaller, pieces, naphtha, reforming, and, steam, reforming, conversion, of, hydrocarbons, into, synthesis, gas, even, the, exhaust, from, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, is, treated, via, catalysis, catalytic, converters, typically, composed, of, platinum, and, rhodium, break, down, some, of, the, more, harmful, byproducts, of, automobile, exhaust, with, regard, to, synthetic, fuels, an, old, but, still, important, process, is, the, fischer, tropsch, synthesis, of, hydrocarbons, from, synthesis, gas, which, itself, is, processed, via, water, gas, shift, reactions, catalyzed, by, iron, the, sabatier, reaction, produces, methane, from, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, biodiesel, and, related, biofuels, require, processing, via, both, inorganic, and, biocatalysts, fuel, cells, rely, on, catalysts, for, both, the, anodic, and, cathodic, reactions, catalytic, heaters, generate, flameless, heat, from, a, supply, of, combustible, fuel, some, of, the, largest, scale, chemicals, are, produced, via, catalytic, oxidation, often, using, oxygen, examples, include, nitric, acid, from, ammonia, sulfuric, acid, from, sulfur, dioxide, to, sulfur, trioxide, by, the, contact, process, terephthalic, acid, from, p, xylene, acrylic, acid, from, propylene, or, propane, and, acrylonitrile, from, propane, and, ammonia, the, production, of, ammonia, is, one, of, the, largest, scale, and, most, energy, intensive, processes, in, the, haber, process, nitrogen, is, combined, with, hydrogen, over, an, iron, oxide, catalyst, methanol, is, prepared, from, carbon, monoxide, or, carbon, dioxide, but, using, copper, zinc, catalysts, bulk, polymers, derived, from, ethylene, and, propylene, are, often, prepared, via, ziegler, natta, catalysis, polyesters, polyamides, and, isocyanates, are, derived, via, acid, base, catalysis, most, carbonylation, processes, require, metal, catalysts, examples, include, the, monsanto, acetic, acid, process, and, hydroformylation, many, fine, chemicals, are, prepared, via, catalysis, methods, include, those, of, heavy, industry, as, well, as, more, specialized, processes, that, would, be, prohibitively, expensive, on, a, large, scale, examples, include, the, heck, reaction, and, friedel, crafts, reactions, because, most, bioactive, compounds, are, chiral, many, pharmaceuticals, are, produced, by, enantioselective, catalysis, catalytic, asymmetric, synthesis, r, 1, 2, propandiol, the, precursor, to, the, antibacterial, levofloxacin, can, be, synthesized, efficiently, from, hydroxyacetone, by, using, catalysts, based, on, binap, ruthenium, complexes, in, noyori, asymmetric, hydrogenation, one, of, the, most, obvious, applications, of, catalysis, is, the, hydrogenation, reaction, with, hydrogen, gas, of, fats, using, nickel, catalyst, to, produce, margarine, many, other, foodstuffs, are, prepared, via, biocatalysis, see, below, catalysis, affects, the, environment, by, increasing, the, efficiency, of, industrial, processes, but, catalysis, also, plays, a, direct, role, in, the, environment, a, notable, example, is, the, catalytic, role, of, chlorine, free, radicals, in, the, breakdown, of, ozone, these, radicals, are, formed, by, the, action, of, ultraviolet, radiation, on, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, the, term, catalyst, broadly, defined, as, anything, that, increases, the, rate, of, a, process, is, derived, from, greek, meaning, to, annul, or, to, untie, or, to, pick, up, the, concept, of, catalysis, was, invented, by, chemist, elizabeth, fulhame, and, described, in, a, 1794, book, based, on, her, novel, work, in, oxidation, reduction, reactions, the, first, chemical, reaction, in, organic, chemistry, that, knowingly, used, a, catalyst, was, studied, in, 1811, by, gottlieb, kirchhoff, who, discovered, the, acid, catalyzed, conversion, of, starch, to, glucose, the, term, catalysis, was, later, used, by, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, in, 1835, to, describe, reactions, that, are, accelerated, by, substances, that, remain, unchanged, after, the, reaction, fulhame, who, predated, berzelius, did, work, with, water, as, opposed, to, metals, in, her, reduction, experiments, other, 18th, century, chemists, who, worked, in, catalysis, were, eilhard, mitscherlich, who, referred, to, it, as, contact, processes, and, johann, wolfgang, d, bereiner, who, spoke, of, contact, action, he, developed, d, bereiner, s, lamp, a, lighter, based, on, hydrogen, and, a, platinum, sponge, which, became, a, commercial, success, in, the, 1820s, that, lives, on, today, humphry, davy, discovered, the, use, of, platinum, in, catalysis, in, the, 1880s, wilhelm, ostwald, at, leipzig, university, started, a, systematic, investigation, into, reactions, that, were, catalyzed, by, the, presence, of, acids, and, bases, and, found, that, chemical, reactions, occur, at, finite, rates, and, that, these, rates, can, be, used, to, determine, the, strengths, of, acids, and, bases, for, this, work, ostwald, was, awarded, the, 1909, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, vladimir, ipatieff, performed, some, of, the, earliest, industrial, scale, reactions, including, the, discovery, and, commercialization, of, oligomerization, and, the, development, of, catalysts, for, hydrogenation, an, added, substance, that, lowers, the, rate, is, called, a, reaction, inhibitor, if, reversible, and, catalyst, poisons, if, irreversible, promoters, are, substances, that, increase, the, catalytic, activity, even, though, they, are, not, catalysts, by, themselves, inhibitors, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, negative, catalysts, since, they, decrease, the, reaction, rate, however, the, term, inhibitor, is, preferred, since, they, do, not, work, by, introducing, a, reaction, path, with, higher, activation, energy, this, would, not, lower, the, rate, since, the, reaction, would, continue, to, occur, by, the, non, catalyzed, path, instead, they, act, either, by, deactivating, catalysts, or, by, removing, reaction, intermediates, such, as, free, radicals, in, heterogeneous, catalysis, coking, inhibits, the, catalyst, which, becomes, covered, by, polymeric, side, products, the, inhibitor, may, modify, selectivity, in, addition, to, rate, for, instance, in, the, hydrogenation, of, alkynes, to, alkenes, a, palladium, pd, catalyst, partly, poisoned, with, lead, ii, acetate, pb, ch, 3, co, 2, 2, can, be, used, lindlar, catalyst, without, the, deactivation, of, the, catalyst, the, alkene, produced, would, be, further, hydrogenated, to, alkane, the, inhibitor, can, produce, this, effect, by, e, g, selectively, poisoning, only, certain, types, of, active, sites, another, mechanism, is, the, modification, of, surface, geometry, for, instance, in, hydrogenation, operations, large, planes, of, metal, surface, function, as, sites, of, hydrogenolysis, catalysis, while, sites, catalyzing, hydrogenation, of, unsaturates, are, smaller, thus, a, poison, that, covers, the, surface, randomly, will, tend, to, lower, the, number, of, uncontaminated, large, planes, but, leave, proportionally, smaller, sites, free, thus, changing, the, hydrogenation, vs, hydrogenolysis, selectivity, many, other, mechanisms, are, also, possible, promoters, can, cover, up, the, surface, to, prevent, the, production, of, a, mat, of, coke, or, even, actively, remove, such, material, e, g, rhenium, on, platinum, in, platforming, they, can, aid, the, dispersion, of, the, catalytic, material, or, bind, to, reagents, original, jag, skall, derf, re,

chemical, affinities
