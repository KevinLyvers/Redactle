a, phase, diagram, in, physical, chemistry, engineering, mineralogy, and, materials, science, is, a, type, of, chart, used, to, show, conditions, pressure, temperature, etc, at, which, thermodynamically, distinct, phases, such, as, solid, liquid, or, gaseous, states, occur, and, coexist, at, equilibrium, common, components, of, a, phase, diagram, are, lines, of, equilibrium, or, phase, boundaries, which, refer, to, lines, that, mark, conditions, under, which, multiple, phases, can, coexist, at, equilibrium, phase, transitions, occur, along, lines, of, equilibrium, metastable, phases, are, not, shown, in, phase, diagrams, as, despite, their, common, occurrence, they, are, not, equilibrium, phases, triple, points, are, points, on, phase, diagrams, where, lines, of, equilibrium, intersect, triple, points, mark, conditions, at, which, three, different, phases, can, coexist, for, example, the, water, phase, diagram, has, a, triple, point, corresponding, to, the, single, temperature, and, pressure, at, which, solid, liquid, and, gaseous, water, can, coexist, in, a, stable, equilibrium, 273, 16, k, and, a, partial, vapor, pressure, of, 611, 657, pa, the, pressure, on, a, pressure, temperature, diagram, such, as, the, water, phase, diagram, shown, is, the, partial, pressure, of, the, substance, in, question, the, solidus, is, the, temperature, below, which, the, substance, is, stable, in, the, solid, state, the, liquidus, is, the, temperature, above, which, the, substance, is, stable, in, a, liquid, state, there, may, be, a, gap, between, the, solidus, and, liquidus, within, the, gap, the, substance, consists, of, a, mixture, of, crystals, and, liquid, like, a, slurry, working, fluids, are, often, categorized, on, the, basis, of, the, shape, of, their, phase, diagram, the, simplest, phase, diagrams, are, pressure, temperature, diagrams, of, a, single, simple, substance, such, as, water, the, axes, correspond, to, the, pressure, and, temperature, the, phase, diagram, shows, in, pressure, temperature, space, the, lines, of, equilibrium, or, phase, boundaries, between, the, three, phases, of, solid, liquid, and, gas, the, curves, on, the, phase, diagram, show, the, points, where, the, free, energy, and, other, derived, properties, becomes, non, analytic, their, derivatives, with, respect, to, the, coordinates, temperature, and, pressure, in, this, example, change, discontinuously, abruptly, for, example, the, heat, capacity, of, a, container, filled, with, ice, will, change, abruptly, as, the, container, is, heated, past, the, melting, point, the, open, spaces, where, the, free, energy, is, analytic, correspond, to, single, phase, regions, single, phase, regions, are, separated, by, lines, of, non, analytical, behavior, where, phase, transitions, occur, which, are, called, phase, boundaries, in, the, diagram, on, the, right, the, phase, boundary, between, liquid, and, gas, does, not, continue, indefinitely, instead, it, terminates, at, a, point, on, the, phase, diagram, called, the, critical, point, this, reflects, the, fact, that, at, extremely, high, temperatures, and, pressures, the, liquid, and, gaseous, phases, become, indistinguishable, in, what, is, known, as, a, supercritical, fluid, in, water, the, critical, point, occurs, at, around, t, c, 647, 096, k, 373, 946, c, p, c, 22, 064, mpa, 217, 75, atm, and, c, 356, kg, m, 3, the, existence, of, the, liquid, gas, critical, point, reveals, a, slight, ambiguity, in, labelling, the, single, phase, regions, when, going, from, the, liquid, to, the, gaseous, phase, one, usually, crosses, the, phase, boundary, but, it, is, possible, to, choose, a, path, that, never, crosses, the, boundary, by, going, to, the, right, of, the, critical, point, thus, the, liquid, and, gaseous, phases, can, blend, continuously, into, each, other, the, solid, liquid, phase, boundary, can, only, end, in, a, critical, point, if, the, solid, and, liquid, phases, have, the, same, symmetry, group, for, most, substances, the, solid, liquid, phase, boundary, or, fusion, curve, in, the, phase, diagram, has, a, positive, slope, so, that, the, melting, point, increases, with, pressure, this, is, true, whenever, the, solid, phase, is, denser, than, the, liquid, phase, the, greater, the, pressure, on, a, given, substance, the, closer, together, the, molecules, of, the, substance, are, brought, to, each, other, which, increases, the, effect, of, the, substance, s, intermolecular, forces, thus, the, substance, requires, a, higher, temperature, for, its, molecules, to, have, enough, energy, to, break, out, of, the, fixed, pattern, of, the, solid, phase, and, enter, the, liquid, phase, a, similar, concept, applies, to, liquid, gas, phase, changes, water, is, an, exception, which, has, a, solid, liquid, boundary, with, negative, slope, so, that, the, melting, point, decreases, with, pressure, this, occurs, because, ice, solid, water, is, less, dense, than, liquid, water, as, shown, by, the, fact, that, ice, floats, on, water, at, a, molecular, level, ice, is, less, dense, because, it, has, a, more, extensive, network, of, hydrogen, bonding, which, requires, a, greater, separation, of, water, molecules, other, exceptions, include, antimony, and, bismuth, at, very, high, pressures, above, 50, gpa, 500, 000, atm, liquid, nitrogen, undergoes, a, liquid, liquid, phase, transition, to, a, polymeric, form, and, becomes, denser, than, solid, nitrogen, at, the, same, pressure, under, these, conditions, therefore, solid, nitrogen, also, floats, in, its, liquid, the, value, of, the, slope, d, p, d, t, is, given, by, the, clausius, clapeyron, equation, for, fusion, melting, where, h, fus, is, the, heat, of, fusion, which, is, always, positive, and, v, fus, is, the, volume, change, for, fusion, for, most, substances, v, fus, is, positive, so, that, the, slope, is, positive, however, for, water, and, other, exceptions, v, fus, is, negative, so, that, the, slope, is, negative, in, addition, to, temperature, and, pressure, other, thermodynamic, properties, may, be, graphed, in, phase, diagrams, examples, of, such, thermodynamic, properties, include, specific, volume, specific, enthalpy, or, specific, entropy, for, example, single, component, graphs, of, temperature, vs, specific, entropy, t, vs, s, for, water, steam, or, for, a, refrigerant, are, commonly, used, to, illustrate, thermodynamic, cycles, such, as, a, carnot, cycle, rankine, cycle, or, vapor, compression, refrigeration, cycle, any, two, thermodynamic, quantities, may, be, shown, on, the, horizontal, and, vertical, axes, of, a, two, dimensional, diagram, additional, thermodynamic, quantities, may, each, be, illustrated, in, increments, as, a, series, of, lines, curved, straight, or, a, combination, of, curved, and, straight, each, of, these, iso, lines, represents, the, thermodynamic, quantity, at, a, certain, constant, value, it, is, possible, to, envision, three, dimensional, 3d, graphs, showing, three, thermodynamic, quantities, for, example, for, a, single, component, a, 3d, cartesian, coordinate, type, graph, can, show, temperature, t, on, one, axis, pressure, p, on, a, second, axis, and, specific, volume, v, on, a, third, such, a, 3d, graph, is, sometimes, called, a, p, v, t, diagram, the, equilibrium, conditions, are, shown, as, curves, on, a, curved, surface, in, 3d, with, areas, for, solid, liquid, and, vapor, phases, and, areas, where, solid, and, liquid, solid, and, vapor, or, liquid, and, vapor, coexist, in, equilibrium, a, line, on, the, surface, called, a, triple, line, is, where, solid, liquid, and, vapor, can, all, coexist, in, equilibrium, the, critical, point, remains, a, point, on, the, surface, even, on, a, 3d, phase, diagram, an, orthographic, projection, of, the, 3d, p, v, t, graph, showing, pressure, and, temperature, as, the, vertical, and, horizontal, axes, collapses, the, 3d, plot, into, the, standard, 2d, pressure, temperature, diagram, when, this, is, done, the, solid, vapor, solid, liquid, and, liquid, vapor, surfaces, collapse, into, three, corresponding, curved, lines, meeting, at, the, triple, point, which, is, the, collapsed, orthographic, projection, of, the, triple, line, other, much, more, complex, types, of, phase, diagrams, can, be, constructed, particularly, when, more, than, one, pure, component, is, present, in, that, case, concentration, becomes, an, important, variable, phase, diagrams, with, more, than, two, dimensions, can, be, constructed, that, show, the, effect, of, more, than, two, variables, on, the, phase, of, a, substance, phase, diagrams, can, use, other, variables, in, addition, to, or, in, place, of, temperature, pressure, and, composition, for, example, the, strength, of, an, applied, electrical, or, magnetic, field, and, they, can, also, involve, substances, that, take, on, more, than, just, three, states, of, matter, one, type, of, phase, diagram, plots, temperature, against, the, relative, concentrations, of, two, substances, in, a, binary, mixture, called, a, binary, phase, diagram, as, shown, at, right, such, a, mixture, can, be, either, a, solid, solution, eutectic, or, peritectic, among, others, these, two, types, of, mixtures, result, in, very, different, graphs, another, type, of, binary, phase, diagram, is, a, boiling, point, diagram, for, a, mixture, of, two, components, i, e, chemical, compounds, for, two, particular, volatile, components, at, a, certain, pressure, such, as, atmospheric, pressure, a, boiling, point, diagram, shows, what, vapor, gas, compositions, are, in, equilibrium, with, given, liquid, compositions, depending, on, temperature, in, a, typical, binary, boiling, point, diagram, temperature, is, plotted, on, a, vertical, axis, and, mixture, composition, on, a, horizontal, axis, a, two, component, diagram, with, components, a, and, b, in, an, ideal, solution, is, shown, the, construction, of, a, liquid, vapor, phase, diagram, assumes, an, ideal, liquid, solution, obeying, raoult, s, law, and, an, ideal, gas, mixture, obeying, dalton, s, law, of, partial, pressure, a, tie, line, from, the, liquid, to, the, gas, at, constant, pressure, would, indicate, the, two, compositions, of, the, liquid, and, gas, respectively, a, simple, example, diagram, with, hypothetical, components, 1, and, 2, in, a, non, azeotropic, mixture, is, shown, at, right, the, fact, that, there, are, two, separate, curved, lines, joining, the, boiling, points, of, the, pure, components, means, that, the, vapor, composition, is, usually, not, the, same, as, the, liquid, composition, the, vapor, is, in, equilibrium, with, see, vapor, liquid, equilibrium, for, more, information, in, addition, to, the, above, mentioned, types, of, phase, diagrams, there, are, many, other, possible, combinations, some, of, the, major, features, of, phase, diagrams, include, congruent, points, where, a, solid, phase, transforms, directly, into, a, liquid, there, is, also, the, peritectoid, a, point, where, two, solid, phases, combine, into, one, solid, phase, during, cooling, the, inverse, of, this, when, one, solid, phase, transforms, into, two, solid, phases, during, cooling, is, called, the, eutectoid, a, complex, phase, diagram, of, great, technological, importance, is, that, of, the, iron, carbon, system, for, less, than, 7, carbon, see, steel, the, x, axis, of, such, a, diagram, represents, the, concentration, variable, of, the, mixture, as, the, mixtures, are, typically, far, from, dilute, and, their, density, as, a, function, of, temperature, is, usually, unknown, the, preferred, concentration, measure, is, mole, fraction, a, volume, based, measure, like, molarity, would, be, inadvisable, a, system, with, three, components, is, called, a, ternary, system, at, constant, pressure, the, maximum, number, of, independent, variables, is, three, the, temperature, and, two, concentration, values, for, a, representation, of, ternary, equilibria, a, three, dimensional, phase, diagram, is, required, often, such, a, diagram, is, drawn, with, the, composition, as, a, horizontal, plane, and, the, temperature, on, an, axis, perpendicular, to, this, plane, to, represent, composition, in, a, ternary, system, an, equilateral, triangle, is, used, called, gibbs, triangle, see, also, ternary, plot, the, temperature, scale, is, plotted, on, the, axis, perpendicular, to, the, composition, triangle, thus, the, space, model, of, a, ternary, phase, diagram, is, a, right, triangular, prism, the, prism, sides, represent, corresponding, binary, systems, a, b, b, c, a, c, however, the, most, common, methods, to, present, phase, equilibria, in, a, ternary, system, are, the, following, 1, projections, on, the, concentration, triangle, abc, of, the, liquidus, solidus, solvus, surfaces, 2, isothermal, sections, 3, vertical, sections, polymorphic, and, polyamorphic, substances, have, multiple, crystal, or, amorphous, phases, which, can, be, graphed, in, a, similar, fashion, to, solid, liquid, and, gas, phases, some, organic, materials, pass, through, intermediate, states, between, solid, and, liquid, these, states, are, called, mesophases, attention, has, been, directed, to, mesophases, because, they, enable, display, devices, and, have, become, commercially, important, through, the, so, called, liquid, crystal, technology, phase, diagrams, are, used, to, describe, the, occurrence, of, mesophases
