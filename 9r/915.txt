microwave, is, a, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, with, wavelengths, shorter, than, other, radio, waves, as, originally, discovered, but, longer, than, infrared, waves, its, wavelength, ranges, from, about, one, meter, to, one, millimeter, corresponding, to, frequencies, between, 300, mhz, and, 300, ghz, broadly, construed, a, more, common, definition, in, radio, frequency, engineering, is, the, range, between, 1, and, 100, ghz, wavelengths, between, 30, cm, and, 3, mm, or, between, 1, and, 3000, ghz, 30, cm, and, 0, 1, mm, the, prefix, micro, in, microwave, is, not, meant, to, suggest, a, wavelength, in, the, micrometer, range, rather, it, indicates, that, microwaves, are, small, having, shorter, wavelengths, compared, to, the, radio, waves, used, in, prior, radio, technology, the, boundaries, between, far, infrared, terahertz, radiation, microwaves, and, ultra, high, frequency, uhf, are, fairly, arbitrary, and, are, used, variously, between, different, fields, of, study, in, all, cases, microwaves, include, the, entire, super, high, frequency, shf, band, 3, to, 30, ghz, or, 10, to, 1, cm, at, minimum, a, broader, definition, includes, uhf, and, extremely, high, frequency, ehf, millimeter, wave, 30, to, 300, ghz, bands, as, well, extremely, high, frequency, is, the, international, telecommunication, union, designation, for, the, band, of, radio, frequencies, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, from, 30, to, 300, gigahertz, ghz, frequencies, in, the, microwave, range, are, often, referred, to, by, their, ieee, radar, band, designations, s, c, x, k, u, k, or, k, a, band, or, by, similar, nato, or, eu, designations, microwaves, travel, by, line, of, sight, unlike, lower, frequency, radio, waves, they, do, not, diffract, around, hills, follow, the, earth, s, surface, as, ground, waves, or, reflect, from, the, ionosphere, so, terrestrial, microwave, communication, links, are, limited, by, the, visual, horizon, to, about, 40, miles, 64, km, at, the, high, end, of, the, band, they, are, absorbed, by, gases, in, the, atmosphere, limiting, practical, communication, distances, to, around, a, kilometer, microwaves, are, widely, used, in, modern, technology, for, example, in, point, to, point, communication, links, wireless, networks, microwave, radio, relay, networks, radar, satellite, and, spacecraft, communication, medical, diathermy, and, cancer, treatment, remote, sensing, radio, astronomy, particle, accelerators, spectroscopy, industrial, heating, collision, avoidance, systems, garage, door, openers, and, keyless, entry, systems, and, for, cooking, food, in, microwave, ovens, microwaves, occupy, a, place, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, with, frequency, above, ordinary, radio, waves, and, below, infrared, light, in, descriptions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, some, sources, classify, microwaves, as, radio, waves, a, subset, of, the, radio, wave, band, while, others, classify, microwaves, and, radio, waves, as, distinct, types, of, radiation, this, is, an, arbitrary, distinction, bands, of, frequencies, in, the, microwave, spectrum, are, designated, by, letters, unfortunately, there, are, several, incompatible, band, designation, systems, and, even, within, a, system, the, frequency, ranges, corresponding, to, some, of, the, letters, vary, somewhat, between, different, application, fields, the, letter, system, had, its, origin, in, world, war, 2, in, a, top, secret, u, s, classification, of, bands, used, in, radar, sets, this, is, the, origin, of, the, oldest, letter, system, the, ieee, radar, bands, one, set, of, microwave, frequency, bands, designations, by, the, radio, society, of, great, britain, rsgb, is, tabulated, below, other, definitions, exist, the, term, p, band, is, sometimes, used, for, uhf, frequencies, below, the, l, band, but, is, now, obsolete, per, ieee, std, 521, when, radars, were, first, developed, at, k, band, during, world, war, 2, it, was, not, known, that, there, was, a, nearby, absorption, band, due, to, water, vapor, and, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, to, avoid, this, problem, the, original, k, band, was, split, into, a, lower, band, k, u, and, upper, band, k, a, microwaves, travel, solely, by, line, of, sight, paths, unlike, lower, frequency, radio, waves, they, do, not, travel, as, ground, waves, which, follow, the, contour, of, the, earth, or, reflect, off, the, ionosphere, skywaves, although, at, the, low, end, of, the, band, they, can, pass, through, building, walls, enough, for, useful, reception, usually, rights, of, way, cleared, to, the, first, fresnel, zone, are, required, therefore, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, microwave, communication, links, are, limited, by, the, visual, horizon, to, about, 30, 40, miles, 48, 64, km, microwaves, are, absorbed, by, moisture, in, the, atmosphere, and, the, attenuation, increases, with, frequency, becoming, a, significant, factor, rain, fade, at, the, high, end, of, the, band, beginning, at, about, 40, ghz, atmospheric, gases, also, begin, to, absorb, microwaves, so, above, this, frequency, microwave, transmission, is, limited, to, a, few, kilometers, a, spectral, band, structure, causes, absorption, peaks, at, specific, frequencies, see, graph, at, right, above, 100, ghz, the, absorption, of, electromagnetic, radiation, by, earth, s, atmosphere, is, so, effective, that, it, is, in, effect, opaque, until, the, atmosphere, becomes, transparent, again, in, the, so, called, infrared, and, optical, window, frequency, ranges, in, a, microwave, beam, directed, at, an, angle, into, the, sky, a, small, amount, of, the, power, will, be, randomly, scattered, as, the, beam, passes, through, the, troposphere, a, sensitive, receiver, beyond, the, horizon, with, a, high, gain, antenna, focused, on, that, area, of, the, troposphere, can, pick, up, the, signal, this, technique, has, been, used, at, frequencies, between, 0, 45, and, 5, ghz, in, tropospheric, scatter, troposcatter, communication, systems, to, communicate, beyond, the, horizon, at, distances, up, to, 300, km, the, short, wavelengths, of, microwaves, allow, omnidirectional, antennas, for, portable, devices, to, be, made, very, small, from, 1, to, 20, centimeters, long, so, microwave, frequencies, are, widely, used, for, wireless, devices, such, as, cell, phones, cordless, phones, and, wireless, lans, wi, fi, access, for, laptops, and, bluetooth, earphones, antennas, used, include, short, whip, antennas, rubber, ducky, antennas, sleeve, dipoles, patch, antennas, and, increasingly, the, printed, circuit, inverted, f, antenna, pifa, used, in, cell, phones, their, short, wavelength, also, allows, narrow, beams, of, microwaves, to, be, produced, by, conveniently, small, high, gain, antennas, from, a, half, meter, to, 5, meters, in, diameter, therefore, beams, of, microwaves, are, used, for, point, to, point, communication, links, and, for, radar, an, advantage, of, narrow, beams, is, that, they, do, not, interfere, with, nearby, equipment, using, the, same, frequency, allowing, frequency, reuse, by, nearby, transmitters, parabolic, dish, antennas, are, the, most, widely, used, directive, antennas, at, microwave, frequencies, but, horn, antennas, slot, antennas, and, lens, antennas, are, also, used, flat, microstrip, antennas, are, being, increasingly, used, in, consumer, devices, another, directive, antenna, practical, at, microwave, frequencies, is, the, phased, array, a, computer, controlled, array, of, antennas, that, produces, a, beam, that, can, be, electronically, steered, in, different, directions, at, microwave, frequencies, the, transmission, lines, which, are, used, to, carry, lower, frequency, radio, waves, to, and, from, antennas, such, as, coaxial, cable, and, parallel, wire, lines, have, excessive, power, losses, so, when, low, attenuation, is, required, microwaves, are, carried, by, metal, pipes, called, waveguides, due, to, the, high, cost, and, maintenance, requirements, of, waveguide, runs, in, many, microwave, antennas, the, output, stage, of, the, transmitter, or, the, rf, front, end, of, the, receiver, is, located, at, the, antenna, the, term, microwave, also, has, a, more, technical, meaning, in, electromagnetics, and, circuit, theory, apparatus, and, techniques, may, be, described, qualitatively, as, microwave, when, the, wavelengths, of, signals, are, roughly, the, same, as, the, dimensions, of, the, circuit, so, that, lumped, element, circuit, theory, is, inaccurate, and, instead, distributed, circuit, elements, and, transmission, line, theory, are, more, useful, methods, for, design, and, analysis, as, a, consequence, practical, microwave, circuits, tend, to, move, away, from, the, discrete, resistors, capacitors, and, inductors, used, with, lower, frequency, radio, waves, open, wire, and, coaxial, transmission, lines, used, at, lower, frequencies, are, replaced, by, waveguides, and, stripline, and, lumped, element, tuned, circuits, are, replaced, by, cavity, resonators, or, resonant, stubs, in, turn, at, even, higher, frequencies, where, the, wavelength, of, the, electromagnetic, waves, becomes, small, in, comparison, to, the, size, of, the, structures, used, to, process, them, microwave, techniques, become, inadequate, and, the, methods, of, optics, are, used, high, power, microwave, sources, use, specialized, vacuum, tubes, to, generate, microwaves, these, devices, operate, on, different, principles, from, low, frequency, vacuum, tubes, using, the, ballistic, motion, of, electrons, in, a, vacuum, under, the, influence, of, controlling, electric, or, magnetic, fields, and, include, the, magnetron, used, in, microwave, ovens, klystron, traveling, wave, tube, twt, and, gyrotron, these, devices, work, in, the, density, modulated, mode, rather, than, the, current, modulated, mode, this, means, that, they, work, on, the, basis, of, clumps, of, electrons, flying, ballistically, through, them, rather, than, using, a, continuous, stream, of, electrons, low, power, microwave, sources, use, solid, state, devices, such, as, the, field, effect, transistor, at, least, at, lower, frequencies, tunnel, diodes, gunn, diodes, and, impatt, diodes, low, power, sources, are, available, as, benchtop, instruments, rackmount, instruments, embeddable, modules, and, in, card, level, formats, a, maser, is, a, solid, state, device, which, amplifies, microwaves, using, similar, principles, to, the, laser, which, amplifies, higher, frequency, light, waves, all, warm, objects, emit, low, level, microwave, black, body, radiation, depending, on, their, temperature, so, in, meteorology, and, remote, sensing, microwave, radiometers, are, used, to, measure, the, temperature, of, objects, or, terrain, the, sun, and, other, astronomical, radio, sources, such, as, cassiopeia, a, emit, low, level, microwave, radiation, which, carries, information, about, their, makeup, which, is, studied, by, radio, astronomers, using, receivers, called, radio, telescopes, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, cmbr, for, example, is, a, weak, microwave, noise, filling, empty, space, which, is, a, major, source, of, information, on, cosmology, s, big, bang, theory, of, the, origin, of, the, universe, microwave, technology, is, extensively, used, for, point, to, point, telecommunications, i, e, non, broadcast, uses, microwaves, are, especially, suitable, for, this, use, since, they, are, more, easily, focused, into, narrower, beams, than, radio, waves, allowing, frequency, reuse, their, comparatively, higher, frequencies, allow, broad, bandwidth, and, high, data, transmission, rates, and, antenna, sizes, are, smaller, than, at, lower, frequencies, because, antenna, size, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, transmitted, frequency, microwaves, are, used, in, spacecraft, communication, and, much, of, the, world, s, data, tv, and, telephone, communications, are, transmitted, long, distances, by, microwaves, between, ground, stations, and, communications, satellites, microwaves, are, also, employed, in, microwave, ovens, and, in, radar, technology, before, the, advent, of, fiber, optic, transmission, most, long, distance, telephone, calls, were, carried, via, networks, of, microwave, radio, relay, links, run, by, carriers, such, as, at, t, long, lines, starting, in, the, early, 1950s, frequency, division, multiplexing, was, used, to, send, up, to, 5, 400, telephone, channels, on, each, microwave, radio, channel, with, as, many, as, ten, radio, channels, combined, into, one, antenna, for, the, hop, to, the, next, site, up, to, 70, km, away, wireless, lan, protocols, such, as, bluetooth, and, the, ieee, 802, 11, specifications, used, for, wi, fi, also, use, microwaves, in, the, 2, 4, ghz, ism, band, although, 802, 11a, uses, ism, band, and, u, nii, frequencies, in, the, 5, ghz, range, licensed, long, range, up, to, about, 25, km, wireless, internet, access, services, have, been, used, for, almost, a, decade, in, many, countries, in, the, 3, 5, 4, 0, ghz, range, the, fcc, recently, carved, out, spectrum, for, carriers, that, wish, to, offer, services, in, this, range, in, the, u, s, with, emphasis, on, 3, 65, ghz, dozens, of, service, providers, across, the, country, are, securing, or, have, already, received, licenses, from, the, fcc, to, operate, in, this, band, the, wimax, service, offerings, that, can, be, carried, on, the, 3, 65, ghz, band, will, give, business, customers, another, option, for, connectivity, metropolitan, area, network, man, protocols, such, as, wimax, worldwide, interoperability, for, microwave, access, are, based, on, standards, such, as, ieee, 802, 16, designed, to, operate, between, 2, and, 11, ghz, commercial, implementations, are, in, the, 2, 3, ghz, 2, 5, ghz, 3, 5, ghz, and, 5, 8, ghz, ranges, mobile, broadband, wireless, access, mbwa, protocols, based, on, standards, specifications, such, as, ieee, 802, 20, or, atis, ansi, hc, sdma, such, as, iburst, operate, between, 1, 6, and, 2, 3, ghz, to, give, mobility, and, in, building, penetration, characteristics, similar, to, mobile, phones, but, with, vastly, greater, spectral, efficiency, some, mobile, phone, networks, like, gsm, use, the, low, microwave, high, uhf, frequencies, around, 1, 8, and, 1, 9, ghz, in, the, americas, and, elsewhere, respectively, dvb, sh, and, s, dmb, use, 1, 452, to, 1, 492, ghz, while, proprietary, incompatible, satellite, radio, in, the, u, s, uses, around, 2, 3, ghz, for, dars, microwave, radio, is, used, in, broadcasting, and, telecommunication, transmissions, because, due, to, their, short, wavelength, highly, directional, antennas, are, smaller, and, therefore, more, practical, than, they, would, be, at, longer, wavelengths, lower, frequencies, there, is, also, more, bandwidth, in, the, microwave, spectrum, than, in, the, rest, of, the, radio, spectrum, the, usable, bandwidth, below, 300, mhz, is, less, than, 300, mhz, while, many, ghz, can, be, used, above, 300, mhz, typically, microwaves, are, used, in, television, news, to, transmit, a, signal, from, a, remote, location, to, a, television, station, from, a, specially, equipped, van, see, broadcast, auxiliary, service, bas, remote, pickup, unit, rpu, and, studio, transmitter, link, stl, most, satellite, communications, systems, operate, in, the, c, x, k, a, or, k, u, bands, of, the, microwave, spectrum, these, frequencies, allow, large, bandwidth, while, avoiding, the, crowded, uhf, frequencies, and, staying, below, the, atmospheric, absorption, of, ehf, frequencies, satellite, tv, either, operates, in, the, c, band, for, the, traditional, large, dish, fixed, satellite, service, or, k, u, band, for, direct, broadcast, satellite, military, communications, run, primarily, over, x, or, k, u, band, links, with, k, a, band, being, used, for, milstar, global, navigation, satellite, systems, gnss, including, the, chinese, beidou, the, american, global, positioning, system, introduced, in, 1978, and, the, russian, glonass, broadcast, navigational, signals, in, various, bands, between, about, 1, 2, ghz, and, 1, 6, ghz, radar, is, a, radiolocation, technique, in, which, a, beam, of, radio, waves, emitted, by, a, transmitter, bounces, off, an, object, and, returns, to, a, receiver, allowing, the, location, range, speed, and, other, characteristics, of, the, object, to, be, determined, the, short, wavelength, of, microwaves, causes, large, reflections, from, objects, the, size, of, motor, vehicles, ships, and, aircraft, also, at, these, wavelengths, the, high, gain, antennas, such, as, parabolic, antennas, which, are, required, to, produce, the, narrow, beamwidths, needed, to, accurately, locate, objects, are, conveniently, small, allowing, them, to, be, rapidly, turned, to, scan, for, objects, therefore, microwave, frequencies, are, the, main, frequencies, used, in, radar, microwave, radar, is, widely, used, for, applications, such, as, air, traffic, control, weather, forecasting, navigation, of, ships, and, speed, limit, enforcement, long, distance, radars, use, the, lower, microwave, frequencies, since, at, the, upper, end, of, the, band, atmospheric, absorption, limits, the, range, but, millimeter, waves, are, used, for, short, range, radar, such, as, collision, avoidance, systems, microwaves, emitted, by, astronomical, radio, sources, planets, stars, galaxies, and, nebulas, are, studied, in, radio, astronomy, with, large, dish, antennas, called, radio, telescopes, in, addition, to, receiving, naturally, occurring, microwave, radiation, radio, telescopes, have, been, used, in, active, radar, experiments, to, bounce, microwaves, off, planets, in, the, solar, system, to, determine, the, distance, to, the, moon, or, map, the, invisible, surface, of, venus, through, cloud, cover, a, recently, completed, microwave, radio, telescope, is, the, atacama, large, millimeter, array, located, at, more, than, 5, 000, meters, 16, 597, ft, altitude, in, chile, which, observes, the, universe, in, the, millimeter, and, submillimeter, wavelength, ranges, the, world, s, largest, ground, based, astronomy, project, to, date, it, consists, of, more, than, 66, dishes, and, was, built, in, an, international, collaboration, by, europe, north, america, east, asia, and, chile, a, major, recent, focus, of, microwave, radio, astronomy, has, been, mapping, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, cmbr, discovered, in, 1964, by, radio, astronomers, arno, penzias, and, robert, wilson, this, faint, background, radiation, which, fills, the, universe, and, is, almost, the, same, in, all, directions, is, relic, radiation, from, the, big, bang, and, is, one, of, the, few, sources, of, information, about, conditions, in, the, early, universe, due, to, the, expansion, and, thus, cooling, of, the, universe, the, originally, high, energy, radiation, has, been, shifted, into, the, microwave, region, of, the, radio, spectrum, sufficiently, sensitive, radio, telescopes, can, detect, the, cmbr, as, a, faint, signal, that, is, not, associated, with, any, star, galaxy, or, other, object, a, microwave, oven, passes, microwave, radiation, at, a, frequency, near, 2, 45, ghz, 12, cm, through, food, causing, dielectric, heating, primarily, by, absorption, of, the, energy, in, water, microwave, ovens, became, common, kitchen, appliances, in, western, countries, in, the, late, 1970s, following, the, development, of, less, expensive, cavity, magnetrons, water, in, the, liquid, state, possesses, many, molecular, interactions, that, broaden, the, absorption, peak, in, the, vapor, phase, isolated, water, molecules, absorb, at, around, 22, ghz, almost, ten, times, the, frequency, of, the, microwave, oven, microwave, heating, is, used, in, industrial, processes, for, drying, and, curing, products, many, semiconductor, processing, techniques, use, microwaves, to, generate, plasma, for, such, purposes, as, reactive, ion, etching, and, plasma, enhanced, chemical, vapor, deposition, pecvd, microwaves, are, used, in, stellarators, and, tokamak, experimental, fusion, reactors, to, help, break, down, the, gas, into, a, plasma, and, heat, it, to, very, high, temperatures, the, frequency, is, tuned, to, the, cyclotron, resonance, of, the, electrons, in, the, magnetic, field, anywhere, between, 2, 200, ghz, hence, it, is, often, referred, to, as, electron, cyclotron, resonance, heating, ecrh, the, upcoming, iter, thermonuclear, reactor, will, use, up, to, 20, mw, of, 170, ghz, microwaves, microwaves, can, be, used, to, transmit, power, over, long, distances, and, post, world, war, 2, research, was, done, to, examine, possibilities, nasa, worked, in, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, to, research, the, possibilities, of, using, solar, power, satellite, sps, systems, with, large, solar, arrays, that, would, beam, power, down, to, the, earth, s, surface, via, microwaves, less, than, lethal, weaponry, exists, that, uses, millimeter, waves, to, heat, a, thin, layer, of, human, skin, to, an, intolerable, temperature, so, as, to, make, the, targeted, person, move, away, a, two, second, burst, of, the, 95, ghz, focused, beam, heats, the, skin, to, a, temperature, of, 54, c, 129, f, at, a, depth, of, 0, 4, millimetres, 1, 64, in, the, united, states, air, force, and, marines, are, currently, using, this, type, of, active, denial, system, in, fixed, installations, microwave, radiation, is, used, in, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, epr, or, esr, spectroscopy, typically, in, the, x, band, region, 9, ghz, in, conjunction, typically, with, magnetic, fields, of, 0, 3, t, this, technique, provides, information, on, unpaired, electrons, in, chemical, systems, such, as, free, radicals, or, transition, metal, ions, such, as, cu, ii, microwave, radiation, is, also, used, to, perform, rotational, spectroscopy, and, can, be, combined, with, electrochemistry, as, in, microwave, enhanced, electrochemistry, microwave, frequency, can, be, measured, by, either, electronic, or, mechanical, techniques, frequency, counters, or, high, frequency, heterodyne, systems, can, be, used, here, the, unknown, frequency, is, compared, with, harmonics, of, a, known, lower, frequency, by, use, of, a, low, frequency, generator, a, harmonic, generator, and, a, mixer, the, accuracy, of, the, measurement, is, limited, by, the, accuracy, and, stability, of, the, reference, source, mechanical, methods, require, a, tunable, resonator, such, as, an, absorption, wavemeter, which, has, a, known, relation, between, a, physical, dimension, and, frequency, in, a, laboratory, setting, lecher, lines, can, be, used, to, directly, measure, the, wavelength, on, a, transmission, line, made, of, parallel, wires, the, frequency, can, then, be, calculated, a, similar, technique, is, to, use, a, slotted, waveguide, or, slotted, coaxial, line, to, directly, measure, the, wavelength, these, devices, consist, of, a, probe, introduced, into, the, line, through, a, longitudinal, slot, so, that, the, probe, is, free, to, travel, up, and, down, the, line, slotted, lines, are, primarily, intended, for, measurement, of, the, voltage, standing, wave, ratio, on, the, line, however, provided, a, standing, wave, is, present, they, may, also, be, used, to, measure, the, distance, between, the, nodes, which, is, equal, to, half, the, wavelength, the, precision, of, this, method, is, limited, by, the, determination, of, the, nodal, locations, microwaves, are, non, ionizing, radiation, which, means, that, microwave, photons, do, not, contain, sufficient, energy, to, ionize, molecules, or, break, chemical, bonds, or, cause, dna, damage, as, ionizing, radiation, such, as, x, rays, or, ultraviolet, can, the, word, radiation, refers, to, energy, radiating, from, a, source, and, not, to, radioactivity, the, main, effect, of, absorption, of, microwaves, is, to, heat, materials, the, electromagnetic, fields, cause, polar, molecules, to, vibrate, it, has, not, been, shown, conclusively, that, microwaves, or, other, non, ionizing, electromagnetic, radiation, have, significant, adverse, biological, effects, at, low, levels, some, but, not, all, studies, suggest, that, long, term, exposure, may, have, a, carcinogenic, effect, during, world, war, ii, it, was, observed, that, individuals, in, the, radiation, path, of, radar, installations, experienced, clicks, and, buzzing, sounds, in, response, to, microwave, radiation, research, by, nasa, in, the, 1970s, has, shown, this, to, be, caused, by, thermal, expansion, in, parts, of, the, inner, ear, in, 1955, dr, james, lovelock, was, able, to, reanimate, rats, chilled, to, 0, and, 1, c, 32, and, 34, f, using, microwave, diathermy, when, injury, from, exposure, to, microwaves, occurs, it, usually, results, from, dielectric, heating, induced, in, the, body, the, lens, and, cornea, of, the, eye, are, especially, vulnerable, because, they, contain, no, blood, vessels, that, can, carry, away, heat, exposure, to, microwave, radiation, can, produce, cataracts, by, this, mechanism, because, the, microwave, heating, denatures, proteins, in, the, crystalline, lens, of, the, eye, in, the, same, way, that, heat, turns, egg, whites, white, and, opaque, exposure, to, heavy, doses, of, microwave, radiation, as, from, an, oven, that, has, been, tampered, with, to, allow, operation, even, with, the, door, open, can, produce, heat, damage, in, other, tissues, as, well, up, to, and, including, serious, burns, that, may, not, be, immediately, evident, because, of, the, tendency, for, microwaves, to, heat, deeper, tissues, with, higher, moisture, content, microwaves, were, first, generated, in, the, 1890s, in, some, of, the, earliest, radio, wave, experiments, by, physicists, who, thought, of, them, as, a, form, of, invisible, light, james, clerk, maxwell, in, his, 1873, theory, of, electromagnetism, now, called, maxwell, s, equations, had, predicted, that, a, coupled, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, could, travel, through, space, as, an, electromagnetic, wave, and, proposed, that, light, consisted, of, electromagnetic, waves, of, short, wavelength, in, 1888, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, was, the, first, to, demonstrate, the, existence, of, electromagnetic, waves, generating, radio, waves, using, a, primitive, spark, gap, radio, transmitter, hertz, and, the, other, early, radio, researchers, were, interested, in, exploring, the, similarities, between, radio, waves, and, light, waves, to, test, maxwell, s, theory, they, concentrated, on, producing, short, wavelength, radio, waves, in, the, uhf, and, microwave, ranges, with, which, they, could, duplicate, classic, optics, experiments, in, their, laboratories, using, quasioptical, components, such, as, prisms, and, lenses, made, of, paraffin, sulfur, and, pitch, and, wire, diffraction, gratings, to, refract, and, diffract, radio, waves, like, light, rays, hertz, produced, waves, up, to, 450, mhz, his, directional, 450, mhz, transmitter, consisted, of, a, 26, cm, brass, rod, dipole, antenna, with, a, spark, gap, between, the, ends, suspended, at, the, focal, line, of, a, parabolic, antenna, made, of, a, curved, zinc, sheet, powered, by, high, voltage, pulses, from, an, induction, coil, his, historic, experiments, demonstrated, that, radio, waves, like, light, exhibited, refraction, diffraction, polarization, interference, and, standing, waves, proving, that, radio, waves, and, light, waves, were, both, forms, of, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, waves, beginning, in, 1894, indian, physicist, jagadish, chandra, bose, performed, the, first, experiments, with, microwaves, he, was, the, first, person, to, produce, millimeter, waves, generating, frequencies, up, to, 60, ghz, 5, millimeter, using, a, 3, mm, metal, ball, spark, oscillator, bose, also, invented, waveguide, horn, antennas, and, semiconductor, crystal, detectors, for, use, in, his, experiments, independently, in, 1894, oliver, lodge, and, augusto, righi, experimented, with, 1, 5, and, 12, ghz, microwaves, respectively, generated, by, small, metal, ball, spark, resonators, russian, physicist, pyotr, lebedev, in, 1895, generated, 50, ghz, millimeter, waves, in, 1897, lord, rayleigh, solved, the, mathematical, boundary, value, problem, of, electromagnetic, waves, propagating, through, conducting, tubes, and, dielectric, rods, of, arbitrary, shape, which, gave, the, modes, and, cutoff, frequency, of, microwaves, propagating, through, a, waveguide, however, since, microwaves, were, limited, to, line, of, sight, paths, they, could, not, communicate, beyond, the, visual, horizon, and, the, low, power, of, the, spark, transmitters, then, in, use, limited, their, practical, range, to, a, few, miles, the, subsequent, development, of, radio, communication, after, 1896, employed, lower, frequencies, which, could, travel, beyond, the, horizon, as, ground, waves, and, by, reflecting, off, the, ionosphere, as, skywaves, and, microwave, frequencies, were, not, further, explored, at, this, time, practical, use, of, microwave, frequencies, did, not, occur, until, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, due, to, a, lack, of, adequate, sources, since, the, triode, vacuum, tube, valve, electronic, oscillator, used, in, radio, transmitters, could, not, produce, frequencies, above, a, few, hundred, megahertz, due, to, excessive, electron, transit, time, and, interelectrode, capacitance, by, the, 1930s, the, first, low, power, microwave, vacuum, tubes, had, been, developed, using, new, principles, the, barkhausen, kurz, tube, and, the, split, anode, magnetron, these, could, generate, a, few, watts, of, power, at, frequencies, up, to, a, few, gigahertz, and, were, used, in, the, first, experiments, in, communication, with, microwaves, in, 1931, an, anglo, french, consortium, headed, by, andre, c, clavier, demonstrated, the, first, experimental, microwave, relay, link, across, the, english, channel, 40, miles, 64, km, between, dover, uk, and, calais, france, the, system, transmitted, telephony, telegraph, and, facsimile, data, over, bidirectional, 1, 7, ghz, beams, with, a, power, of, one, half, watt, produced, by, miniature, barkhausen, kurz, tubes, at, the, focus, of, 10, foot, 3, m, metal, dishes, a, word, was, needed, to, distinguish, these, new, shorter, wavelengths, which, had, previously, been, lumped, into, the, short, wave, band, which, meant, all, waves, shorter, than, 200, meters, the, terms, quasi, optical, waves, and, ultrashort, waves, were, used, briefly, but, did, not, catch, on, the, first, usage, of, the, word, micro, wave, apparently, occurred, in, 1931, the, development, of, radar, mainly, in, secrecy, before, and, during, world, war, ii, resulted, in, the, technological, advances, which, made, microwaves, practical, wavelengths, in, the, centimeter, range, were, required, to, give, the, small, radar, antennas, which, were, compact, enough, to, fit, on, aircraft, a, narrow, enough, beamwidth, to, localize, enemy, aircraft, it, was, found, that, conventional, transmission, lines, used, to, carry, radio, waves, had, excessive, power, losses, at, microwave, frequencies, and, george, southworth, at, bell, labs, and, wilmer, barrow, at, mit, independently, invented, waveguide, in, 1936, barrow, invented, the, horn, antenna, in, 1938, as, a, means, to, efficiently, radiate, microwaves, into, or, out, of, a, waveguide, in, a, microwave, receiver, a, nonlinear, component, was, needed, that, would, act, as, a, detector, and, mixer, at, these, frequencies, as, vacuum, tubes, had, too, much, capacitance, to, fill, this, need, researchers, resurrected, an, obsolete, technology, the, point, contact, crystal, detector, cat, whisker, detector, which, was, used, as, a, demodulator, in, crystal, radios, around, the, turn, of, the, century, before, vacuum, tube, receivers, the, low, capacitance, of, semiconductor, junctions, allowed, them, to, function, at, microwave, frequencies, the, first, modern, silicon, and, germanium, diodes, were, developed, as, microwave, detectors, in, the, 1930s, and, the, principles, of, semiconductor, physics, learned, during, their, development, led, to, semiconductor, electronics, after, the, war, the, first, powerful, sources, of, microwaves, were, invented, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, the, klystron, tube, by, russell, and, sigurd, varian, at, stanford, university, in, 1937, and, the, cavity, magnetron, tube, by, john, randall, and, harry, boot, at, birmingham, university, uk, in, 1940, ten, centimeter, 3, ghz, microwave, radar, was, in, use, on, british, warplanes, in, late, 1941, and, proved, to, be, a, game, changer, britain, s, 1940, decision, to, share, its, microwave, technology, with, its, us, ally, the, tizard, mission, significantly, shortened, the, war, the, mit, radiation, laboratory, established, secretly, at, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, in, 1940, to, research, radar, produced, much, of, the, theoretical, knowledge, necessary, to, use, microwaves, the, first, microwave, relay, systems, were, developed, by, the, allied, military, near, the, end, of, the, war, and, used, for, secure, battlefield, communication, networks, in, the, european, theater, after, world, war, ii, microwaves, were, rapidly, exploited, commercially, due, to, their, high, frequency, they, had, a, very, large, information, carrying, capacity, bandwidth, a, single, microwave, beam, could, carry, tens, of, thousands, of, phone, calls, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, transcontinental, microwave, relay, networks, were, built, in, the, us, and, europe, to, exchange, telephone, calls, between, cities, and, distribute, television, programs, in, the, new, television, broadcasting, industry, from, the, 1940s, microwave, dishes, were, used, to, transmit, backhaul, video, feeds, from, mobile, production, trucks, back, to, the, studio, allowing, the, first, remote, tv, broadcasts, the, first, communications, satellites, were, launched, in, the, 1960s, which, relayed, telephone, calls, and, television, between, widely, separated, points, on, earth, using, microwave, beams, in, 1964, arno, penzias, and, robert, woodrow, wilson, while, investigating, noise, in, a, satellite, horn, antenna, at, bell, labs, holmdel, new, jersey, discovered, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, microwave, radar, became, the, central, technology, used, in, air, traffic, control, maritime, navigation, anti, aircraft, defense, ballistic, missile, detection, and, later, many, other, uses, radar, and, satellite, communication, motivated, the, development, of, modern, microwave, antennas, the, parabolic, antenna, the, most, common, type, cassegrain, antenna, lens, antenna, slot, antenna, and, phased, array, the, ability, of, short, waves, to, quickly, heat, materials, and, cook, food, had, been, investigated, in, the, 1930s, by, ilia, e, mouromtseff, at, westinghouse, and, at, the, 1933, chicago, world, s, fair, demonstrated, cooking, meals, with, a, 60, mhz, radio, transmitter, in, 1945, percy, spencer, an, engineer, working, on, radar, at, raytheon, noticed, that, microwave, radiation, from, a, magnetron, oscillator, melted, a, candy, bar, in, his, pocket, he, investigated, cooking, with, microwaves, and, invented, the, microwave, oven, consisting, of, a, magnetron, feeding, microwaves, into, a, closed, metal, cavity, containing, food, which, was, patented, by, raytheon, on, 8, october, 1945, due, to, their, expense, microwave, ovens, were, initially, used, in, institutional, kitchens, but, by, 1986, roughly, 25, of, households, in, the, u, s, owned, one, microwave, heating, became, widely, used, as, an, industrial, process, in, industries, such, as, plastics, fabrication, and, as, a, medical, therapy, to, kill, cancer, cells, in, microwave, hyperthermy, the, traveling, wave, tube, twt, developed, in, 1943, by, rudolph, kompfner, and, john, pierce, provided, a, high, power, tunable, source, of, microwaves, up, to, 50, ghz, and, became, the, most, widely, used, microwave, tube, besides, the, ubiquitous, magnetron, used, in, microwave, ovens, the, gyrotron, tube, family, developed, in, russia, could, produce, megawatts, of, power, up, into, millimeter, wave, frequencies, and, is, used, in, industrial, heating, and, plasma, research, and, to, power, particle, accelerators, and, nuclear, fusion, reactors, the, development, of, semiconductor, electronics, in, the, 1950s, led, to, the, first, solid, state, microwave, devices, which, worked, by, a, new, principle, negative, resistance, some, of, the, prewar, microwave, tubes, had, also, used, negative, resistance, the, feedback, oscillator, and, two, port, amplifiers, which, were, used, at, lower, frequencies, became, unstable, at, microwave, frequencies, and, negative, resistance, oscillators, and, amplifiers, based, on, one, port, devices, like, diodes, worked, better, the, tunnel, diode, invented, in, 1957, by, japanese, physicist, leo, esaki, could, produce, a, few, milliwatts, of, microwave, power, its, invention, set, off, a, search, for, better, negative, resistance, semiconductor, devices, for, use, as, microwave, oscillators, resulting, in, the, invention, of, the, impatt, diode, in, 1956, by, w, t, read, and, ralph, l, johnston, and, the, gunn, diode, in, 1962, by, j, b, gunn, diodes, are, the, most, widely, used, microwave, sources, today, two, low, noise, solid, state, negative, resistance, microwave, amplifiers, were, developed, the, ruby, maser, invented, in, 1953, by, charles, h, townes, james, p, gordon, and, h, j, zeiger, and, the, varactor, parametric, amplifier, developed, in, 1956, by, marion, hines, these, were, used, for, low, noise, microwave, receivers, in, radio, telescopes, and, satellite, ground, stations, the, maser, led, to, the, development, of, atomic, clocks, which, keep, time, using, a, precise, microwave, frequency, emitted, by, atoms, undergoing, an, electron, transition, between, two, energy, levels, negative, resistance, amplifier, circuits, required, the, invention, of, new, nonreciprocal, waveguide, components, such, as, circulators, isolators, and, directional, couplers, in, 1969, kaneyuki, kurokawa, derived, mathematical, conditions, for, stability, in, negative, resistance, circuits, which, formed, the, basis, of, microwave, oscillator, design, prior, to, the, 1970s, microwave, devices, and, circuits, were, bulky, and, expensive, so, microwave, frequencies, were, generally, limited, to, the, output, stage, of, transmitters, and, the, rf, front, end, of, receivers, and, signals, were, heterodyned, to, a, lower, intermediate, frequency, for, processing, the, period, from, the, 1970s, to, the, present, has, seen, the, development, of, tiny, inexpensive, active, solid, state, microwave, components, which, can, be, mounted, on, circuit, boards, allowing, circuits, to, perform, significant, signal, processing, at, microwave, frequencies, this, has, made, possible, satellite, television, cable, television, gps, devices, and, modern, wireless, devices, such, as, smartphones, wi, fi, and, bluetooth, which, connect, to, networks, using, microwaves, microstrip, a, type, of, transmission, line, usable, at, microwave, frequencies, was, invented, with, printed, circuits, in, the, 1950s, the, ability, to, cheaply, fabricate, a, wide, range, of, shapes, on, printed, circuit, boards, allowed, microstrip, versions, of, capacitors, inductors, resonant, stubs, splitters, directional, couplers, diplexers, filters, and, antennas, to, be, made, thus, allowing, compact, microwave, circuits, to, be, constructed, transistors, that, operated, at, microwave, frequencies, were, developed, in, the, 1970s, the, semiconductor, gallium, arsenide, gaas, has, a, much, higher, electron, mobility, than, silicon, so, devices, fabricated, with, this, material, can, operate, at, 4, times, the, frequency, of, similar, devices, of, silicon, beginning, in, the, 1970s, gaas, was, used, to, make, the, first, microwave, transistors, and, it, has, dominated, microwave, semiconductors, ever, since, mesfets, metal, semiconductor, field, effect, transistors, fast, gaas, field, effect, transistors, using, schottky, junctions, for, the, gate, were, developed, starting, in, 1968, and, have, reached, cutoff, frequencies, of, 100, ghz, and, are, now, the, most, widely, used, active, microwave, devices, another, family, of, transistors, with, a, higher, frequency, limit, is, the, hemt, high, electron, mobility, transistor, a, field, effect, transistor, made, with, two, different, semiconductors, algaas, and, gaas, using, heterojunction, technology, and, the, similar, hbt, heterojunction, bipolar, transistor, gaas, can, be, made, semi, insulating, allowing, it, to, be, used, as, a, substrate, on, which, circuits, containing, passive, components, as, well, as, transistors, can, be, fabricated, by, lithography, by, 1976, this, led, to, the, first, integrated, circuits, ics, which, functioned, at, microwave, frequencies, called, monolithic, microwave, integrated, circuits, mmic, the, word, monolithic, was, added, to, distinguish, these, from, microstrip, pcb, circuits, which, were, called, microwave, integrated, circuits, mic, since, then, silicon, mmics, have, also, been, developed, today, mmics, have, become, the, workhorses, of, both, analog, and, digital, high, frequency, electronics, enabling, the, production, of, single, chip, microwave, receivers, broadband, amplifiers, modems, and, microprocessors, elf, 3, hz, 100, mm, 30, hz, 10, mm, slf,
