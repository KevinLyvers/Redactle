the, kilogram, also, spelled, kilogramme, is, the, base, unit, of, mass, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, having, the, unit, symbol, kg, it, is, a, widely, used, measure, in, science, engineering, and, commerce, worldwide, and, is, often, simply, called, a, kilo, colloquially, it, means, one, thousand, grams, the, kilogram, is, a, si, base, unit, defined, in, terms, of, two, other, base, units, the, second, and, the, metre, and, the, planck, constant, a, si, defining, constant, 131, a, properly, equipped, metrology, laboratory, can, calibrate, a, mass, measurement, instrument, such, as, a, kibble, balance, as, a, primary, standard, for, the, kilogram, mass, the, kilogram, was, originally, defined, in, 1795, during, the, french, revolution, as, the, mass, of, one, litre, of, water, the, current, definition, of, a, kilogram, agrees, with, this, original, definition, to, within, 30, parts, per, million, in, 1799, the, platinum, kilogramme, des, archives, replaced, it, as, the, standard, of, mass, in, 1889, a, cylinder, of, platinum, iridium, the, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, ipk, became, the, standard, of, the, unit, of, mass, for, the, metric, system, and, remained, so, for, 130, years, before, the, current, standard, was, adopted, in, 2019, the, kilogram, is, defined, in, terms, of, three, defining, constants, the, formal, definition, according, to, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, is, the, kilogram, symbol, kg, is, the, si, unit, of, mass, it, is, defined, by, taking, the, fixed, numerical, value, of, the, planck, constant, h, to, be, 6, 626, 070, 15, 10, 34, when, expressed, in, the, unit, j, s, which, is, equal, to, kg, m, 2, s, 1, where, the, metre, and, the, second, are, defined, in, terms, of, c, and, cs, defined, in, term, of, those, units, the, kg, is, formulated, as, this, definition, is, generally, consistent, with, previous, definitions, the, mass, remains, within, 30, ppm, of, the, mass, of, one, litre, of, water, the, kilogram, is, the, only, base, si, unit, with, an, si, prefix, kilo, as, part, of, its, name, the, word, kilogramme, or, kilogram, is, derived, from, the, french, kilogramme, which, itself, was, a, learned, coinage, prefixing, the, greek, stem, of, khilioi, a, thousand, to, gramma, a, late, latin, term, for, a, small, weight, itself, from, greek, the, word, kilogramme, was, written, into, french, law, in, 1795, in, the, decree, of, 18, germinal, which, revised, the, provisional, system, of, units, introduced, by, the, french, national, convention, two, years, earlier, where, the, gravet, had, been, defined, as, weight, poids, of, a, cubic, centimetre, of, water, equal, to, 1, 1000, of, a, grave, in, the, decree, of, 1795, the, term, gramme, thus, replaced, gravet, and, kilogramme, replaced, grave, the, french, spelling, was, adopted, in, great, britain, when, the, word, was, used, for, the, first, time, in, english, in, 1795, with, the, spelling, kilogram, being, adopted, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, kingdom, both, spellings, are, used, with, kilogram, having, become, by, far, the, more, common, uk, law, regulating, the, units, to, be, used, when, trading, by, weight, or, measure, does, not, prevent, the, use, of, either, spelling, in, the, 19th, century, the, french, word, kilo, a, shortening, of, kilogramme, was, imported, into, the, english, language, where, it, has, been, used, to, mean, both, kilogram, and, kilometre, while, kilo, as, an, alternative, is, acceptable, to, the, economist, for, example, the, canadian, government, s, termium, plus, system, states, that, si, international, system, of, units, usage, followed, in, scientific, and, technical, writing, does, not, allow, its, usage, and, it, is, described, as, a, common, informal, name, on, russ, rowlett, s, dictionary, of, units, of, measurement, when, the, united, states, congress, gave, the, metric, system, legal, status, in, 1866, it, permitted, the, use, of, the, word, kilo, as, an, alternative, to, the, word, kilogram, but, in, 1990, revoked, the, status, of, the, word, kilo, the, si, system, was, introduced, in, 1960, and, in, 1970, the, bipm, started, publishing, the, si, brochure, which, contains, all, relevant, decisions, and, recommendations, by, the, cgpm, concerning, units, the, si, brochure, states, that, it, is, not, permissible, to, use, abbreviations, for, unit, symbols, or, unit, names, for, use, with, east, asian, character, sets, the, si, symbol, is, encoded, as, a, single, unicode, character, u, 338f, square, kg, in, the, cjk, compatibility, block, the, replacement, of, the, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, ipk, as, the, primary, standard, was, motivated, by, evidence, accumulated, over, a, long, period, of, time, that, the, mass, of, the, ipk, and, its, replicas, had, been, changing, the, ipk, had, diverged, from, its, replicas, by, approximately, 50, micrograms, since, their, manufacture, late, in, the, 19th, century, this, led, to, several, competing, efforts, to, develop, measurement, technology, precise, enough, to, warrant, replacing, the, kilogram, artefact, with, a, definition, based, directly, on, physical, fundamental, constants, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, approved, a, revision, in, november, 2018, that, defines, the, kilogram, by, defining, the, planck, constant, to, be, exactly, 6, 626, 070, 15, 10, 34, kg, m, 2, s, 1, effectively, defining, the, kilogram, in, terms, of, the, second, and, the, metre, the, new, definition, took, effect, on, may, 20, 2019, prior, to, the, redefinition, the, kilogram, and, several, other, si, units, based, on, the, kilogram, were, defined, by, a, man, made, metal, artifact, the, kilogramme, des, archives, from, 1799, to, 1889, and, the, ipk, from, 1889, to, 2019, in, 1960, the, metre, previously, similarly, having, been, defined, with, reference, to, a, single, platinum, iridium, bar, with, two, marks, on, it, was, redefined, in, terms, of, an, invariant, physical, constant, the, wavelength, of, a, particular, emission, of, light, emitted, by, krypton, and, later, the, speed, of, light, so, that, the, standard, can, be, independently, reproduced, in, different, laboratories, by, following, a, written, specification, at, the, 94th, meeting, of, the, cipm, in, 2005, it, was, recommended, that, the, same, be, done, with, the, kilogram, in, october, 2010, the, cipm, voted, to, submit, a, resolution, for, consideration, at, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, to, take, note, of, an, intention, that, the, kilogram, be, defined, in, terms, of, the, planck, constant, h, which, has, dimensions, of, energy, times, time, thus, mass, length, 2, time, together, with, other, physical, constants, this, resolution, was, accepted, by, the, 24th, conference, of, the, cgpm, in, october, 2011, and, further, discussed, at, the, 25th, conference, in, 2014, although, the, committee, recognised, that, significant, progress, had, been, made, they, concluded, that, the, data, did, not, yet, appear, sufficiently, robust, to, adopt, the, revised, definition, and, that, work, should, continue, to, enable, the, adoption, at, the, 26th, meeting, scheduled, for, 2018, such, a, definition, would, theoretically, permit, any, apparatus, that, was, capable, of, delineating, the, kilogram, in, terms, of, the, planck, constant, to, be, used, as, long, as, it, possessed, sufficient, precision, accuracy, and, stability, the, kibble, balance, is, one, way, to, do, this, as, part, of, this, project, a, variety, of, very, different, technologies, and, approaches, were, considered, and, explored, over, many, years, some, of, these, approaches, were, based, on, equipment, and, procedures, that, would, enable, the, reproducible, production, of, new, kilogram, mass, prototypes, on, demand, albeit, with, extraordinary, effort, using, measurement, techniques, and, material, properties, that, are, ultimately, based, on, or, traceable, to, physical, constants, others, were, based, on, devices, that, measured, either, the, acceleration, or, weight, of, hand, tuned, kilogram, test, masses, and, which, expressed, their, magnitudes, in, electrical, terms, via, special, components, that, permit, traceability, to, physical, constants, all, approaches, depend, on, converting, a, weight, measurement, to, a, mass, and, therefore, require, precise, measurement, of, the, strength, of, gravity, in, laboratories, gravimetry, all, approaches, would, have, precisely, fixed, one, or, more, constants, of, nature, at, a, defined, value, because, an, si, unit, may, not, have, multiple, prefixes, see, si, prefix, prefixes, are, added, to, gram, rather, than, the, base, unit, kilogram, which, already, has, a, prefix, as, part, of, its, name, for, instance, one, millionth, of, a, kilogram, is, 1, mg, one, milligram, not, 1, kg, one, microkilogram
