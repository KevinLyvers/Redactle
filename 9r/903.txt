in, physics, a, dipole, from, ancient, greek, d, s, twice, and, p, los, axis, is, an, electromagnetic, phenomenon, which, occurs, in, two, ways, dipoles, whether, electric, or, magnetic, can, be, characterized, by, their, dipole, moment, a, vector, quantity, for, the, simple, electric, dipole, the, electric, dipole, moment, points, from, the, negative, charge, towards, the, positive, charge, and, has, a, magnitude, equal, to, the, strength, of, each, charge, times, the, separation, between, the, charges, to, be, precise, for, the, definition, of, the, dipole, moment, one, should, always, consider, the, dipole, limit, where, for, example, the, distance, of, the, generating, charges, should, converge, to, 0, while, simultaneously, the, charge, strength, should, diverge, to, infinity, in, such, a, way, that, the, product, remains, a, positive, constant, for, the, magnetic, dipole, current, loop, the, magnetic, dipole, moment, points, through, the, loop, according, to, the, right, hand, grip, rule, with, a, magnitude, equal, to, the, current, in, the, loop, times, the, area, of, the, loop, similar, to, magnetic, current, loops, the, electron, particle, and, some, other, fundamental, particles, have, magnetic, dipole, moments, as, an, electron, generates, a, magnetic, field, identical, to, that, generated, by, a, very, small, current, loop, however, an, electron, s, magnetic, dipole, moment, is, not, due, to, a, current, loop, but, to, an, intrinsic, property, of, the, electron, the, electron, may, also, have, an, electric, dipole, moment, though, such, has, yet, to, be, observed, see, electron, electric, dipole, moment, a, permanent, magnet, such, as, a, bar, magnet, owes, its, magnetism, to, the, intrinsic, magnetic, dipole, moment, of, the, electron, the, two, ends, of, a, bar, magnet, are, referred, to, as, poles, not, to, be, confused, with, monopoles, see, classification, below, and, may, be, labeled, north, and, south, in, terms, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, they, are, respectively, north, seeking, and, south, seeking, poles, if, the, magnet, were, freely, suspended, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, north, seeking, pole, would, point, towards, the, north, and, the, south, seeking, pole, would, point, towards, the, south, the, dipole, moment, of, the, bar, magnet, points, from, its, magnetic, south, to, its, magnetic, north, pole, in, a, magnetic, compass, the, north, pole, of, a, bar, magnet, points, north, however, that, means, that, earth, s, geomagnetic, north, pole, is, the, south, pole, south, seeking, pole, of, its, dipole, moment, and, vice, versa, the, only, known, mechanisms, for, the, creation, of, magnetic, dipoles, are, by, current, loops, or, quantum, mechanical, spin, since, the, existence, of, magnetic, monopoles, has, never, been, experimentally, demonstrated, a, physical, dipole, consists, of, two, equal, and, opposite, point, charges, in, the, literal, sense, two, poles, its, field, at, large, distances, i, e, distances, large, in, comparison, to, the, separation, of, the, poles, depends, almost, entirely, on, the, dipole, moment, as, defined, above, a, point, electric, dipole, is, the, limit, obtained, by, letting, the, separation, tend, to, 0, while, keeping, the, dipole, moment, fixed, the, field, of, a, point, dipole, has, a, particularly, simple, form, and, the, order, 1, term, in, the, multipole, expansion, is, precisely, the, point, dipole, field, although, there, are, no, known, magnetic, monopoles, in, nature, there, are, magnetic, dipoles, in, the, form, of, the, quantum, mechanical, spin, associated, with, particles, such, as, electrons, although, the, accurate, description, of, such, effects, falls, outside, of, classical, electromagnetism, a, theoretical, magnetic, point, dipole, has, a, magnetic, field, of, exactly, the, same, form, as, the, electric, field, of, an, electric, point, dipole, a, very, small, current, carrying, loop, is, approximately, a, magnetic, point, dipole, the, magnetic, dipole, moment, of, such, a, loop, is, the, product, of, the, current, flowing, in, the, loop, and, the, vector, area, of, the, loop, any, configuration, of, charges, or, currents, has, a, dipole, moment, which, describes, the, dipole, whose, field, is, the, best, approximation, at, large, distances, to, that, of, the, given, configuration, this, is, simply, one, term, in, the, multipole, expansion, when, the, total, charge, monopole, moment, is, 0, as, it, always, is, for, the, magnetic, case, since, there, are, no, magnetic, monopoles, the, dipole, term, is, the, dominant, one, at, large, distances, its, field, falls, off, in, proportion, to, 1, r, 3, as, compared, to, 1, r, 4, for, the, next, quadrupole, term, and, higher, powers, of, 1, r, for, higher, terms, or, 1, r, 2, for, the, monopole, term, many, molecules, have, such, dipole, moments, due, to, non, uniform, distributions, of, positive, and, negative, charges, on, the, various, atoms, such, is, the, case, with, polar, compounds, like, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, where, electron, density, is, shared, unequally, between, atoms, therefore, a, molecule, s, dipole, is, an, electric, dipole, with, an, inherent, electric, field, that, should, not, be, confused, with, a, magnetic, dipole, which, generates, a, magnetic, field, the, physical, chemist, peter, j, w, debye, was, the, first, scientist, to, study, molecular, dipoles, extensively, and, as, a, consequence, dipole, moments, are, measured, in, the, non, si, unit, named, debye, in, his, honor, for, molecules, there, are, three, types, of, dipoles, more, generally, an, induced, dipole, of, any, polarizable, charge, distribution, remember, that, a, molecule, has, a, charge, distribution, is, caused, by, an, electric, field, external, to, this, field, may, for, instance, originate, from, an, ion, or, polar, molecule, in, the, vicinity, of, or, may, be, macroscopic, e, g, a, molecule, between, the, plates, of, a, charged, capacitor, the, size, of, the, induced, dipole, moment, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, strength, of, the, external, field, and, the, dipole, polarizability, of, dipole, moment, values, can, be, obtained, from, measurement, of, the, dielectric, constant, some, typical, gas, phase, values, given, with, the, unit, debye, are, potassium, bromide, kbr, has, one, of, the, highest, dipole, moments, because, it, is, an, ionic, compound, that, exists, as, a, molecule, in, the, gas, phase, the, overall, dipole, moment, of, a, molecule, may, be, approximated, as, a, vector, sum, of, bond, dipole, moments, as, a, vector, sum, it, depends, on, the, relative, orientation, of, the, bonds, so, that, from, the, dipole, moment, information, can, be, deduced, about, the, molecular, geometry, for, example, the, zero, dipole, of, co, 2, implies, that, the, two, c, o, bond, dipole, moments, cancel, so, that, the, molecule, must, be, linear, for, h, 2, o, the, o, h, bond, moments, do, not, cancel, because, the, molecule, is, bent, for, ozone, o, 3, which, is, also, a, bent, molecule, the, bond, dipole, moments, are, not, zero, even, though, the, o, o, bonds, are, between, similar, atoms, this, agrees, with, the, lewis, structures, for, the, resonance, forms, of, ozone, which, show, a, positive, charge, on, the, central, oxygen, atom, an, example, in, organic, chemistry, of, the, role, of, geometry, in, determining, dipole, moment, is, the, cis, and, trans, isomers, of, 1, 2, dichloroethene, in, the, cis, isomer, the, two, polar, c, cl, bonds, are, on, the, same, side, of, the, c, c, double, bond, and, the, molecular, dipole, moment, is, 1, 90, d, in, the, trans, isomer, the, dipole, moment, is, zero, because, the, two, c, cl, bonds, are, on, opposite, sides, of, the, c, c, and, cancel, and, the, two, bond, moments, for, the, much, less, polar, c, h, bonds, also, cancel, another, example, of, the, role, of, molecular, geometry, is, boron, trifluoride, which, has, three, polar, bonds, with, a, difference, in, electronegativity, greater, than, the, traditionally, cited, threshold, of, 1, 7, for, ionic, bonding, however, due, to, the, equilateral, triangular, distribution, of, the, fluoride, ions, centered, on, and, in, the, same, plane, as, the, boron, cation, the, symmetry, of, the, molecule, results, in, its, dipole, moment, being, zero, consider, a, collection, of, n, particles, with, charges, q, i, and, position, vectors, r, i, for, instance, this, collection, may, be, a, molecule, consisting, of, electrons, all, with, charge, e, and, nuclei, with, charge, ez, i, where, z, i, is, the, atomic, number, of, the, i, th, nucleus, the, dipole, observable, physical, quantity, has, the, quantum, mechanical, dipole, operator, notice, that, this, definition, is, valid, only, for, neutral, atoms, or, molecules, i, e, total, charge, equal, to, zero, in, the, ionized, case, we, have, where, r, c, displaystyle, mathbf, r, c, is, the, center, of, mass, of, the, molecule, group, of, particles, a, non, degenerate, s, state, atom, can, have, only, a, zero, permanent, dipole, this, fact, follows, quantum, mechanically, from, the, inversion, symmetry, of, atoms, all, 3, components, of, the, dipole, operator, are, antisymmetric, under, inversion, with, respect, to, the, nucleus, where, p, displaystyle, mathfrak, p, is, the, dipole, operator, and, i, displaystyle, mathfrak, i, is, the, inversion, operator, the, permanent, dipole, moment, of, an, atom, in, a, non, degenerate, state, see, degenerate, energy, level, is, given, as, the, expectation, average, value, of, the, dipole, operator, where, s, displaystyle, s, rangle, is, an, s, state, non, degenerate, wavefunction, which, is, symmetric, or, antisymmetric, under, inversion, i, s, s, displaystyle, mathfrak, i, s, rangle, pm, s, rangle, since, the, product, of, the, wavefunction, in, the, ket, and, its, complex, conjugate, in, the, bra, is, always, symmetric, under, inversion, and, its, inverse, it, follows, that, the, expectation, value, changes, sign, under, inversion, we, used, here, the, fact, that, i, displaystyle, mathfrak, i, being, a, symmetry, operator, is, unitary, i, 1, i, displaystyle, mathfrak, i, 1, mathfrak, i, and, by, definition, the, hermitian, adjoint, i, displaystyle, mathfrak, i, may, be, moved, from, bra, to, ket, and, then, becomes, i, i, displaystyle, mathfrak, i, mathfrak, i, since, the, only, quantity, that, is, equal, to, minus, itself, is, the, zero, the, expectation, value, vanishes, in, the, case, of, open, shell, atoms, with, degenerate, energy, levels, one, could, define, a, dipole, moment, by, the, aid, of, the, first, order, stark, effect, this, gives, a, non, vanishing, dipole, by, definition, proportional, to, a, non, vanishing, first, order, stark, shift, only, if, some, of, the, wavefunctions, belonging, to, the, degenerate, energies, have, opposite, parity, i, e, have, different, behavior, under, inversion, this, is, a, rare, occurrence, but, happens, for, the, excited, h, atom, where, 2s, and, 2p, states, are, accidentally, degenerate, see, article, laplace, runge, lenz, vector, for, the, origin, of, this, degeneracy, and, have, opposite, parity, 2s, is, even, and, 2p, is, odd, the, far, field, strength, b, of, a, dipole, magnetic, field, is, given, by, where, conversion, to, cylindrical, coordinates, is, achieved, using, r, 2, z, 2, 2, and, where, is, the, perpendicular, distance, from, the, z, axis, then, the, field, itself, is, a, vector, quantity, where, this, is, exactly, the, field, of, a, point, dipole, exactly, the, dipole, term, in, the, multipole, expansion, of, an, arbitrary, field, and, approximately, the, field, of, any, dipole, like, configuration, at, large, distances, the, vector, potential, a, of, a, magnetic, dipole, is, with, the, same, definitions, as, above, the, electrostatic, potential, at, position, r, due, to, an, electric, dipole, at, the, origin, is, given, by, where, p, is, the, vector, dipole, moment, and, 0, is, the, permittivity, of, free, space, this, term, appears, as, the, second, term, in, the, multipole, expansion, of, an, arbitrary, electrostatic, potential, r, if, the, source, of, r, is, a, dipole, as, it, is, assumed, here, this, term, is, the, only, non, vanishing, term, in, the, multipole, expansion, of, r, the, electric, field, from, a, dipole, can, be, found, from, the, gradient, of, this, potential, this, is, of, the, same, form, of, the, expression, for, the, magnetic, field, of, a, point, magnetic, dipole, ignoring, the, delta, function, in, a, real, electric, dipole, however, the, charges, are, physically, separate, and, the, electric, field, diverges, or, converges, at, the, point, charges, this, is, different, to, the, magnetic, field, of, a, real, magnetic, dipole, which, is, continuous, everywhere, the, delta, function, represents, the, strong, field, pointing, in, the, opposite, direction, between, the, point, charges, which, is, often, omitted, since, one, is, rarely, interested, in, the, field, at, the, dipole, s, position, for, further, discussions, about, the, internal, field, of, dipoles, see, or, magnetic, moment, internal, magnetic, field, of, a, dipole, since, the, direction, of, an, electric, field, is, defined, as, the, direction, of, the, force, on, a, positive, charge, electric, field, lines, point, away, from, a, positive, charge, and, toward, a, negative, charge, when, placed, in, a, homogeneous, electric, or, magnetic, field, equal, but, opposite, forces, arise, on, each, side, of, the, dipole, creating, a, torque, for, an, electric, dipole, moment, p, in, coulomb, meters, or, for, a, magnetic, dipole, moment, m, in, ampere, square, meters, the, resulting, torque, will, tend, to, align, the, dipole, with, the, applied, field, which, in, the, case, of, an, electric, dipole, yields, a, potential, energy, of, the, energy, of, a, magnetic, dipole, is, similarly, in, addition, to, dipoles, in, electrostatics, it, is, also, common, to, consider, an, electric, or, magnetic, dipole, that, is, oscillating, in, time, it, is, an, extension, or, a, more, physical, next, step, to, spherical, wave, radiation, in, particular, consider, a, harmonically, oscillating, electric, dipole, with, angular, frequency, and, a, dipole, moment, p, 0, along, the, direction, of, the, form, in, vacuum, the, exact, field, produced, by, this, oscillating, dipole, can, be, derived, using, the, retarded, potential, formulation, as, for, r, c, 1, the, far, field, takes, the, simpler, form, of, a, radiating, spherical, wave, but, with, angular, dependence, embedded, in, the, cross, product, the, time, averaged, poynting, vector, is, not, distributed, isotropically, but, concentrated, around, the, directions, lying, perpendicular, to, the, dipole, moment, as, a, result, of, the, non, spherical, electric, and, magnetic, waves, in, fact, the, spherical, harmonic, function, sin, responsible, for, such, toroidal, angular, distribution, is, precisely, the, l, 1, p, wave, the, total, time, average, power, radiated, by, the, field, can, then, be, derived, from, the, poynting, vector, as, notice, that, the, dependence, of, the, power, on, the, fourth, power, of, the, frequency, of, the, radiation, is, in, accordance, with, the, rayleigh, scattering, and, the, underlying, effects, why, the, sky, consists, of, mainly, blue, colour, a, circular, polarized, dipole, is, described, as, a, superposition, of, two, linear, dipoles
