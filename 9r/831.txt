theoretical, physics, is, a, branch, of, physics, that, employs, mathematical, models, and, abstractions, of, physical, objects, and, systems, to, rationalize, explain, and, predict, natural, phenomena, this, is, in, contrast, to, experimental, physics, which, uses, experimental, tools, to, probe, these, phenomena, the, advancement, of, science, generally, depends, on, the, interplay, between, experimental, studies, and, theory, in, some, cases, theoretical, physics, adheres, to, standards, of, mathematical, rigour, while, giving, little, weight, to, experiments, and, observations, for, example, while, developing, special, relativity, albert, einstein, was, concerned, with, the, lorentz, transformation, which, left, maxwell, s, equations, invariant, but, was, apparently, uninterested, in, the, michelson, morley, experiment, on, earth, s, drift, through, a, luminiferous, aether, conversely, einstein, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, explaining, the, photoelectric, effect, previously, an, experimental, result, lacking, a, theoretical, formulation, a, physical, theory, is, a, model, of, physical, events, it, is, judged, by, the, extent, to, which, its, predictions, agree, with, empirical, observations, the, quality, of, a, physical, theory, is, also, judged, on, its, ability, to, make, new, predictions, which, can, be, verified, by, new, observations, a, physical, theory, differs, from, a, mathematical, theorem, in, that, while, both, are, based, on, some, form, of, axioms, judgment, of, mathematical, applicability, is, not, based, on, agreement, with, any, experimental, results, a, physical, theory, similarly, differs, from, a, mathematical, theory, in, the, sense, that, the, word, theory, has, a, different, meaning, in, mathematical, terms, r, i, c, k, g, displaystyle, mathrm, ric, kg, the, equations, for, an, einstein, manifold, used, in, general, relativity, to, describe, the, curvature, of, spacetime, a, physical, theory, involves, one, or, more, relationships, between, various, measurable, quantities, archimedes, realized, that, a, ship, floats, by, displacing, its, mass, of, water, pythagoras, understood, the, relation, between, the, length, of, a, vibrating, string, and, the, musical, tone, it, produces, other, examples, include, entropy, as, a, measure, of, the, uncertainty, regarding, the, positions, and, motions, of, unseen, particles, and, the, quantum, mechanical, idea, that, action, and, energy, are, not, continuously, variable, theoretical, physics, consists, of, several, different, approaches, in, this, regard, theoretical, particle, physics, forms, a, good, example, for, instance, phenomenologists, might, employ, semi, empirical, formulas, and, heuristics, to, agree, with, experimental, results, often, without, deep, physical, understanding, modelers, also, called, model, builders, often, appear, much, like, phenomenologists, but, try, to, model, speculative, theories, that, have, certain, desirable, features, rather, than, on, experimental, data, or, apply, the, techniques, of, mathematical, modeling, to, physics, problems, some, attempt, to, create, approximate, theories, called, effective, theories, because, fully, developed, theories, may, be, regarded, as, unsolvable, or, too, complicated, other, theorists, may, try, to, unify, formalise, reinterpret, or, generalise, extant, theories, or, create, completely, new, ones, altogether, sometimes, the, vision, provided, by, pure, mathematical, systems, can, provide, clues, to, how, a, physical, system, might, be, modeled, e, g, the, notion, due, to, riemann, and, others, that, space, itself, might, be, curved, theoretical, problems, that, need, computational, investigation, are, often, the, concern, of, computational, physics, theoretical, advances, may, consist, in, setting, aside, old, incorrect, paradigms, e, g, aether, theory, of, light, propagation, caloric, theory, of, heat, burning, consisting, of, evolving, phlogiston, or, astronomical, bodies, revolving, around, the, earth, or, may, be, an, alternative, model, that, provides, answers, that, are, more, accurate, or, that, can, be, more, widely, applied, in, the, latter, case, a, correspondence, principle, will, be, required, to, recover, the, previously, known, result, sometimes, though, advances, may, proceed, along, different, paths, for, example, an, essentially, correct, theory, may, need, some, conceptual, or, factual, revisions, atomic, theory, first, postulated, millennia, ago, by, several, thinkers, in, greece, and, india, and, the, two, fluid, theory, of, electricity, are, two, cases, in, this, point, however, an, exception, to, all, the, above, is, the, wave, particle, duality, a, theory, combining, aspects, of, different, opposing, models, via, the, bohr, complementarity, principle, physical, theories, become, accepted, if, they, are, able, to, make, correct, predictions, and, no, or, few, incorrect, ones, the, theory, should, have, at, least, as, a, secondary, objective, a, certain, economy, and, elegance, compare, to, mathematical, beauty, a, notion, sometimes, called, occam, s, razor, after, the, 13th, century, english, philosopher, william, of, occam, or, ockham, in, which, the, simpler, of, two, theories, that, describe, the, same, matter, just, as, adequately, is, preferred, but, conceptual, simplicity, may, mean, mathematical, complexity, they, are, also, more, likely, to, be, accepted, if, they, connect, a, wide, range, of, phenomena, testing, the, consequences, of, a, theory, is, part, of, the, scientific, method, physical, theories, can, be, grouped, into, three, categories, mainstream, theories, proposed, theories, and, fringe, theories, theoretical, physics, began, at, least, 2, 300, years, ago, under, the, pre, socratic, philosophy, and, continued, by, plato, and, aristotle, whose, views, held, sway, for, a, millennium, during, the, rise, of, medieval, universities, the, only, acknowledged, intellectual, disciplines, were, the, seven, liberal, arts, of, the, trivium, like, grammar, logic, and, rhetoric, and, of, the, quadrivium, like, arithmetic, geometry, music, and, astronomy, during, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, the, concept, of, experimental, science, the, counterpoint, to, theory, began, with, scholars, such, as, ibn, al, haytham, and, francis, bacon, as, the, scientific, revolution, gathered, pace, the, concepts, of, matter, energy, space, time, and, causality, slowly, began, to, acquire, the, form, we, know, today, and, other, sciences, spun, off, from, the, rubric, of, natural, philosophy, thus, began, the, modern, era, of, theory, with, the, copernican, paradigm, shift, in, astronomy, soon, followed, by, johannes, kepler, s, expressions, for, planetary, orbits, which, summarized, the, meticulous, observations, of, tycho, brahe, the, works, of, these, men, alongside, galileo, s, can, perhaps, be, considered, to, constitute, the, scientific, revolution, the, great, push, toward, the, modern, concept, of, explanation, started, with, galileo, one, of, the, few, physicists, who, was, both, a, consummate, theoretician, and, a, great, experimentalist, the, analytic, geometry, and, mechanics, of, descartes, were, incorporated, into, the, calculus, and, mechanics, of, isaac, newton, another, theoretician, experimentalist, of, the, highest, order, writing, principia, mathematica, in, it, contained, a, grand, synthesis, of, the, work, of, copernicus, galileo, and, kepler, as, well, as, newton, s, theories, of, mechanics, and, gravitation, which, held, sway, as, worldviews, until, the, early, 20th, century, simultaneously, progress, was, also, made, in, optics, in, particular, colour, theory, and, the, ancient, science, of, geometrical, optics, courtesy, of, newton, descartes, and, the, dutchmen, snell, and, huygens, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, joseph, louis, lagrange, leonhard, euler, and, william, rowan, hamilton, would, extend, the, theory, of, classical, mechanics, considerably, they, picked, up, the, interactive, intertwining, of, mathematics, and, physics, begun, two, millennia, earlier, by, pythagoras, among, the, great, conceptual, achievements, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, were, the, consolidation, of, the, idea, of, energy, as, well, as, its, global, conservation, by, the, inclusion, of, heat, electricity, and, magnetism, and, then, light, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, and, most, importantly, the, introduction, of, the, singular, concept, of, entropy, began, to, provide, a, macroscopic, explanation, for, the, properties, of, matter, statistical, mechanics, followed, by, statistical, physics, and, quantum, statistical, mechanics, emerged, as, an, offshoot, of, thermodynamics, late, in, the, 19th, century, another, important, event, in, the, 19th, century, was, the, discovery, of, electromagnetic, theory, unifying, the, previously, separate, phenomena, of, electricity, magnetism, and, light, the, pillars, of, modern, physics, and, perhaps, the, most, revolutionary, theories, in, the, history, of, physics, have, been, relativity, theory, and, quantum, mechanics, newtonian, mechanics, was, subsumed, under, special, relativity, and, newton, s, gravity, was, given, a, kinematic, explanation, by, general, relativity, quantum, mechanics, led, to, an, understanding, of, blackbody, radiation, which, indeed, was, an, original, motivation, for, the, theory, and, of, anomalies, in, the, specific, heats, of, solids, and, finally, to, an, understanding, of, the, internal, structures, of, atoms, and, molecules, quantum, mechanics, soon, gave, way, to, the, formulation, of, quantum, field, theory, qft, begun, in, the, late, 1920s, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, 2, more, progress, brought, much, renewed, interest, in, qft, which, had, since, the, early, efforts, stagnated, the, same, period, also, saw, fresh, attacks, on, the, problems, of, superconductivity, and, phase, transitions, as, well, as, the, first, applications, of, qft, in, the, area, of, theoretical, condensed, matter, the, 1960s, and, 70s, saw, the, formulation, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, using, qft, and, progress, in, condensed, matter, physics, theoretical, foundations, of, superconductivity, and, critical, phenomena, among, others, in, parallel, to, the, applications, of, relativity, to, problems, in, astronomy, and, cosmology, respectively, all, of, these, achievements, depended, on, the, theoretical, physics, as, a, moving, force, both, to, suggest, experiments, and, to, consolidate, results, often, by, ingenious, application, of, existing, mathematics, or, as, in, the, case, of, descartes, and, newton, with, leibniz, by, inventing, new, mathematics, fourier, s, studies, of, heat, conduction, led, to, a, new, branch, of, mathematics, infinite, orthogonal, series, modern, theoretical, physics, attempts, to, unify, theories, and, explain, phenomena, in, further, attempts, to, understand, the, universe, from, the, cosmological, to, the, elementary, particle, scale, where, experimentation, cannot, be, done, theoretical, physics, still, tries, to, advance, through, the, use, of, mathematical, models, mainstream, theories, sometimes, referred, to, as, central, theories, are, the, body, of, knowledge, of, both, factual, and, scientific, views, and, possess, a, usual, scientific, quality, of, the, tests, of, repeatability, consistency, with, existing, well, established, science, and, experimentation, there, do, exist, mainstream, theories, that, are, generally, accepted, theories, based, solely, upon, their, effects, explaining, a, wide, variety, of, data, although, the, detection, explanation, and, possible, composition, are, subjects, of, debate, the, proposed, theories, of, physics, are, usually, relatively, new, theories, which, deal, with, the, study, of, physics, which, include, scientific, approaches, means, for, determining, the, validity, of, models, and, new, types, of, reasoning, used, to, arrive, at, the, theory, however, some, proposed, theories, include, theories, that, have, been, around, for, decades, and, have, eluded, methods, of, discovery, and, testing, proposed, theories, can, include, fringe, theories, in, the, process, of, becoming, established, and, sometimes, gaining, wider, acceptance, proposed, theories, usually, have, not, been, tested, in, addition, to, the, theories, like, those, listed, below, there, are, also, different, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, which, may, or, may, not, be, considered, different, theories, since, it, is, debatable, whether, they, yield, different, predictions, for, physical, experiments, even, in, principle, for, example, ads, cft, correspondence, chern, simons, theory, graviton, magnetic, monopole, string, theory, theory, of, everything, fringe, theories, include, any, new, area, of, scientific, endeavor, in, the, process, of, becoming, established, and, some, proposed, theories, it, can, include, speculative, sciences, this, includes, physics, fields, and, physical, theories, presented, in, accordance, with, known, evidence, and, a, body, of, associated, predictions, have, been, made, according, to, that, theory, some, fringe, theories, go, on, to, become, a, widely, accepted, part, of, physics, other, fringe, theories, end, up, being, disproven, some, fringe, theories, are, a, form, of, protoscience, and, others, are, a, form, of, pseudoscience, the, falsification, of, the, original, theory, sometimes, leads, to, reformulation, of, the, theory, thought, experiments, are, situations, created, in, one, s, mind, asking, a, question, akin, to, suppose, you, are, in, this, situation, assuming, such, is, true, what, would, follow, they, are, usually, created, to, investigate, phenomena, that, are, not, readily, experienced, in, every, day, situations, famous, examples, of, such, thought, experiments, are, schr, dinger, s, cat, the, epr, thought, experiment, simple, illustrations, of, time, dilation, and, so, on, these, usually, lead, to, real, experiments, designed, to, verify, that, the, conclusion, and, therefore, the, assumptions, of, the, thought, experiments, are, correct, the, epr, thought, experiment, led, to, the, bell, inequalities, which, were, then, tested, to, various, degrees, of, rigor, leading, to, the, acceptance, of, the, current, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, and, probabilism, as, a, working, hypothesis
