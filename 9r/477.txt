sodium, chloride, s, o, d, i, m, k, l, r, a, d, commonly, known, as, edible, salt, is, an, ionic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, nacl, representing, a, 1, 1, ratio, of, sodium, and, chlorine, ions, it, is, transparent, or, translucent, brittle, hygroscopic, and, occurs, as, the, mineral, halite, in, its, edible, form, it, is, commonly, used, as, a, condiment, and, food, preservative, large, quantities, of, sodium, chloride, are, used, in, many, industrial, processes, and, it, is, a, major, source, of, sodium, and, chlorine, compounds, used, as, feedstocks, for, further, chemical, syntheses, another, major, application, of, sodium, chloride, is, deicing, of, roadways, in, sub, freezing, weather, in, addition, to, the, familiar, domestic, uses, of, salt, more, dominant, applications, of, the, approximately, 250, million, tonnes, per, year, production, 2008, data, include, chemicals, and, de, icing, salt, is, used, directly, or, indirectly, in, the, production, of, many, chemicals, which, consume, most, of, the, world, s, production, it, is, the, starting, point, for, the, chloralkali, process, the, industrial, process, to, produce, chlorine, and, sodium, hydroxide, according, to, the, chemical, equation, this, electrolysis, is, conducted, in, either, a, mercury, cell, a, diaphragm, cell, or, a, membrane, cell, each, of, those, uses, a, different, method, to, separate, the, chlorine, from, the, sodium, hydroxide, other, technologies, are, under, development, due, to, the, high, energy, consumption, of, the, electrolysis, whereby, small, improvements, in, the, efficiency, can, have, large, economic, paybacks, some, applications, of, chlorine, include, pvc, thermoplastics, production, disinfectants, and, solvents, sodium, hydroxide, is, extensively, used, in, many, different, industries, enabling, production, of, paper, soap, and, aluminium, etc, sodium, chloride, is, used, in, the, solvay, process, to, produce, sodium, carbonate, and, calcium, chloride, sodium, carbonate, in, turn, is, used, to, produce, glass, sodium, bicarbonate, and, dyes, as, well, as, a, myriad, of, other, chemicals, in, the, mannheim, process, sodium, chloride, is, used, for, the, production, of, sodium, sulfate, and, hydrochloric, acid, sodium, chloride, is, heavily, used, so, even, relatively, minor, applications, can, consume, massive, quantities, in, oil, and, gas, exploration, salt, is, an, important, component, of, drilling, fluids, in, well, drilling, it, is, used, to, flocculate, and, increase, the, density, of, the, drilling, fluid, to, overcome, high, downwell, gas, pressures, whenever, a, drill, hits, a, salt, formation, salt, is, added, to, the, drilling, fluid, to, saturate, the, solution, in, order, to, minimize, the, dissolution, within, the, salt, stratum, salt, is, also, used, to, increase, the, curing, of, concrete, in, cemented, casings, in, textiles, and, dyeing, salt, is, used, as, a, brine, rinse, to, separate, organic, contaminants, to, promote, salting, out, of, dyestuff, precipitates, and, to, blend, with, concentrated, dyes, to, increase, yield, in, dyebaths, and, make, the, colors, look, sharper, one, of, its, main, roles, is, to, provide, the, positive, ion, charge, to, promote, the, absorption, of, negatively, charged, ions, of, dyes, for, use, in, the, pulp, and, paper, industry, it, is, used, to, manufacture, sodium, chlorate, which, is, then, reacted, with, sulfuric, acid, and, a, reducing, agent, such, as, methanol, to, manufacture, chlorine, dioxide, a, bleaching, chemical, that, is, widely, used, to, bleach, wood, pulp, in, tanning, and, leather, treatment, salt, is, added, to, animal, hides, to, inhibit, microbial, activity, on, the, underside, of, the, hides, and, to, attract, moisture, back, into, the, hides, in, rubber, manufacture, salt, is, used, to, make, buna, neoprene, and, white, rubber, types, salt, brine, and, sulfuric, acid, are, used, to, coagulate, an, emulsified, latex, made, from, chlorinated, butadiene, salt, also, is, added, to, secure, the, soil, and, to, provide, firmness, to, the, foundation, on, which, highways, are, built, the, salt, acts, to, minimize, the, effects, of, shifting, caused, in, the, subsurface, by, changes, in, humidity, and, traffic, load, hard, water, contains, calcium, and, magnesium, ions, that, interfere, with, action, of, soap, and, contribute, to, the, buildup, of, a, scale, or, film, of, alkaline, mineral, deposits, in, household, and, industrial, equipment, and, pipes, commercial, and, residential, water, softening, units, use, ion, exchange, resins, to, remove, ions, that, cause, the, hardness, these, resins, are, generated, and, regenerated, using, sodium, chloride, the, second, major, application, of, salt, is, for, deicing, and, anti, icing, of, roads, both, in, grit, bins, and, spread, by, winter, service, vehicles, in, anticipation, of, snowfall, roads, are, optimally, anti, iced, with, brine, concentrated, solution, of, salt, in, water, which, prevents, bonding, between, the, snow, ice, and, the, road, surface, this, procedure, obviates, the, heavy, use, of, salt, after, the, snowfall, for, de, icing, mixtures, of, brine, and, salt, are, used, sometimes, with, additional, agents, such, as, calcium, chloride, and, or, magnesium, chloride, the, use, of, salt, or, brine, becomes, ineffective, below, 10, c, 14, f, salt, for, de, icing, in, the, united, kingdom, predominantly, comes, from, a, single, mine, in, winsford, in, cheshire, prior, to, distribution, it, is, mixed, with, 100, ppm, of, sodium, ferrocyanide, as, an, anticaking, agent, which, enables, rock, salt, to, flow, freely, out, of, the, gritting, vehicles, despite, being, stockpiled, prior, to, use, in, recent, years, this, additive, has, also, been, used, in, table, salt, other, additives, had, been, used, in, road, salt, to, reduce, the, total, costs, for, example, in, the, us, a, byproduct, carbohydrate, solution, from, sugar, beet, processing, was, mixed, with, rock, salt, and, adhered, to, road, surfaces, about, 40, better, than, loose, rock, salt, alone, because, it, stayed, on, the, road, longer, the, treatment, did, not, have, to, be, repeated, several, times, saving, time, and, money, in, the, technical, terms, of, physical, chemistry, the, minimum, freezing, point, of, a, water, salt, mixture, is, 21, 12, c, 6, 02, f, for, 23, 31, wt, of, salt, freezing, near, this, concentration, is, however, so, slow, that, the, eutectic, point, of, 22, 4, c, 8, 3, f, can, be, reached, with, about, 25, wt, of, salt, road, salt, ends, up, in, fresh, water, bodies, and, could, harm, aquatic, plants, and, animals, by, disrupting, their, osmoregulation, ability, the, omnipresence, of, salt, in, coastal, areas, poses, a, problem, in, any, coating, application, because, trapped, salts, cause, great, problems, in, adhesion, naval, authorities, and, ship, builders, monitor, the, salt, concentrations, on, surfaces, during, construction, maximal, salt, concentrations, on, surfaces, are, dependent, on, the, authority, and, application, the, imo, regulation, is, mostly, used, and, sets, salt, levels, to, a, maximum, of, 50, mg, m, 2, soluble, salts, measured, as, sodium, chloride, these, measurements, are, done, by, means, of, a, bresle, test, salinization, increasing, salinity, aka, freshwater, salinization, syndrome, and, subsequent, increased, metal, leaching, is, an, ongoing, problem, throughout, north, america, and, european, fresh, waterways, in, highway, de, icing, salt, has, been, associated, with, corrosion, of, bridge, decks, motor, vehicles, reinforcement, bar, and, wire, and, unprotected, steel, structures, used, in, road, construction, surface, runoff, vehicle, spraying, and, windblown, salt, also, affect, soil, roadside, vegetation, and, local, surface, water, and, groundwater, supplies, although, evidence, of, environmental, loading, of, salt, has, been, found, during, peak, usage, the, spring, rains, and, thaws, usually, dilute, the, concentrations, of, sodium, in, the, area, where, salt, was, applied, a, 2009, study, found, that, approximately, 70, of, the, road, salt, being, applied, in, the, minneapolis, st, paul, metro, area, is, retained, in, the, local, watershed, some, agencies, are, substituting, beer, molasses, and, beet, juice, instead, of, road, salt, airlines, utilize, more, glycol, and, sugar, rather, than, salt, based, solutions, for, deicing, salt, is, added, to, food, either, by, the, food, producer, or, by, the, consumer, as, a, flavor, enhancer, preservative, binder, fermentation, control, additive, texture, control, agent, and, color, developer, the, salt, consumption, in, the, food, industry, is, subdivided, in, descending, order, of, consumption, into, other, food, processing, meat, packers, canning, baking, dairy, and, grain, mill, products, salt, is, added, to, promote, color, development, in, bacon, ham, and, other, processed, meat, products, as, a, preservative, salt, inhibits, the, growth, of, bacteria, salt, acts, as, a, binder, in, sausages, to, form, a, binding, gel, made, up, of, meat, fat, and, moisture, salt, also, acts, as, a, flavor, enhancer, and, as, a, tenderizer, it, is, used, as, a, cheap, and, safe, desiccant, because, of, its, hygroscopic, properties, making, salting, an, effective, method, of, food, preservation, historically, the, salt, draws, water, out, of, bacteria, through, osmotic, pressure, keeping, it, from, reproducing, a, major, source, of, food, spoilage, even, though, more, effective, desiccants, are, available, few, are, safe, for, humans, to, ingest, many, microorganisms, cannot, live, in, a, salty, environment, water, is, drawn, out, of, their, cells, by, osmosis, for, this, reason, salt, is, used, to, preserve, some, foods, such, as, bacon, fish, or, cabbage, in, many, dairy, industries, salt, is, added, to, cheese, as, a, color, fermentation, and, texture, control, agent, the, dairy, subsector, includes, companies, that, manufacture, creamery, butter, condensed, and, evaporated, milk, frozen, desserts, ice, cream, natural, and, processed, cheese, and, specialty, dairy, products, in, canning, salt, is, primarily, added, as, a, flavor, enhancer, and, preservative, it, also, is, used, as, a, carrier, for, other, ingredients, dehydrating, agent, enzyme, inhibitor, and, tenderizer, in, baking, salt, is, added, to, control, the, rate, of, fermentation, in, bread, dough, it, also, is, used, to, strengthen, the, gluten, the, elastic, protein, water, complex, in, certain, doughs, and, as, a, flavor, enhancer, such, as, a, topping, on, baked, goods, the, food, processing, category, also, contains, grain, mill, products, these, products, consist, of, milling, flour, and, rice, and, manufacturing, cereal, breakfast, food, and, blended, or, prepared, flour, salt, is, also, used, a, seasoning, agent, e, g, in, potato, chips, pretzels, and, cat, and, dog, food, sodium, chloride, is, used, in, veterinary, medicine, as, emesis, causing, agent, it, is, given, as, warm, saturated, solution, emesis, can, also, be, caused, by, pharyngeal, placement, of, small, amount, of, plain, salt, or, salt, crystals, sodium, chloride, is, used, together, with, water, as, one, of, the, primary, solutions, for, intravenous, therapy, nasal, spray, often, contains, a, saline, solution, sodium, chloride, is, also, available, as, an, oral, tablet, and, is, taken, to, treat, low, sodium, levels, sodium, chloride, is, the, principal, extinguishing, agent, in, dry, powder, fire, extinguishers, that, are, used, on, combustible, metal, fires, for, metals, such, as, magnesium, zirconium, titanium, and, lithium, class, d, extinguishers, the, salt, forms, an, oxygen, excluding, crust, that, smothers, the, fire, since, at, least, medieval, times, people, have, used, salt, as, a, cleansing, agent, rubbed, on, household, surfaces, it, is, also, used, in, many, brands, of, shampoo, toothpaste, and, popularly, to, de, ice, driveways, and, patches, of, ice, sodium, chloride, crystals, have, a, transmittance, of, at, least, 90, through, 1, mm, for, infrared, light, having, wavelengths, in, the, range, 0, 2, 18, m, they, were, used, in, optical, components, such, as, windows, and, lenses, where, few, non, absorbing, alternatives, existed, in, that, spectral, range, while, inexpensive, nacl, crystals, are, soft, and, hygroscopic, when, exposed, to, the, water, in, ambient, air, they, gradually, cover, with, frost, this, limits, application, of, nacl, to, dry, environments, vacuum, sealed, areas, or, short, term, uses, such, as, prototyping, materials, that, are, mechanically, stronger, and, less, sensitive, to, moisture, such, as, zinc, selenide, and, chalcogenide, glasses, more, widely, used, than, nacl, in, solid, sodium, chloride, each, ion, is, surrounded, by, six, ions, of, the, opposite, charge, as, expected, on, electrostatic, grounds, the, surrounding, ions, are, located, at, the, vertices, of, a, regular, octahedron, in, the, language, of, close, packing, the, larger, chloride, ions, 167, pm, in, size, are, arranged, in, a, cubic, array, whereas, the, smaller, sodium, ions, 116, pm, fill, all, the, cubic, gaps, octahedral, voids, between, them, this, same, basic, structure, is, found, in, many, other, compounds, and, is, commonly, known, as, the, nacl, structure, or,
