in, ecology, a, marsh, is, a, wetland, that, is, dominated, by, herbaceous, plants, rather, than, by, woody, plants, more, in, general, the, word, can, be, used, for, any, low, lying, and, seasonally, waterlogged, terrain, in, europe, and, in, agricultural, literature, low, lying, meadows, that, require, draining, and, embanked, polderlands, are, also, referred, to, as, marshes, or, marshland, marshes, can, often, be, found, at, the, edges, of, lakes, and, streams, where, they, form, a, transition, between, the, aquatic, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, they, are, often, dominated, by, grasses, rushes, or, reeds, if, woody, plants, are, present, they, tend, to, be, low, growing, shrubs, and, the, marsh, is, sometimes, called, a, carr, this, form, of, vegetation, is, what, differentiates, marshes, from, other, types, of, wetland, such, as, swamps, which, are, dominated, by, trees, and, mires, which, are, wetlands, that, have, accumulated, deposits, of, acidic, peat, marshes, provide, habitats, for, many, kinds, of, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl, and, aquatic, mammals, this, biological, productivity, means, that, marshes, contain, 0, 1, of, global, sequestered, terrestrial, carbon, moreover, they, have, an, outsized, influence, on, climate, resilience, of, coastal, areas, and, waterways, absorbing, high, tides, and, other, water, changes, due, to, extreme, weather, though, some, marshes, are, expected, to, migrate, upland, most, natural, marshlands, will, be, threatened, by, sea, level, rise, and, associated, erosion, marshes, provide, a, habitat, for, many, species, of, plants, animals, and, insects, that, have, adapted, to, living, in, flooded, conditions, or, other, environments, the, plants, must, be, able, to, survive, in, wet, mud, with, low, oxygen, levels, many, of, these, plants, therefore, have, aerenchyma, channels, within, the, stem, that, allow, air, to, move, from, the, leaves, into, the, rooting, zone, marsh, plants, also, tend, to, have, rhizomes, for, underground, storage, and, reproduction, common, examples, include, cattails, sedges, papyrus, and, sawgrass, aquatic, animals, from, fish, to, salamanders, are, generally, able, to, live, with, a, low, amount, of, oxygen, in, the, water, some, can, obtain, oxygen, from, the, air, instead, while, others, can, live, indefinitely, in, conditions, of, low, oxygen, the, ph, in, marshes, tends, to, be, neutral, to, alkaline, as, opposed, to, bogs, where, peat, accumulates, under, more, acid, conditions, marshes, provide, habitats, for, many, kinds, of, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl, and, aquatic, mammals, marshes, have, extremely, high, levels, of, biological, production, some, of, the, highest, in, the, world, and, therefore, are, important, in, supporting, fisheries, marshes, also, improve, water, quality, by, acting, as, a, sink, to, filter, pollutants, and, sediment, from, the, water, that, flows, through, them, marshes, partake, in, water, purification, by, providing, nutrient, and, pollution, consumption, marshes, and, other, wetlands, are, able, to, absorb, water, during, periods, of, heavy, rainfall, and, slowly, release, it, into, waterways, and, therefore, reduce, the, magnitude, of, flooding, marshes, also, provide, the, services, of, tourism, recreation, education, and, research, marshes, differ, depending, mainly, on, their, location, and, salinity, these, factors, greatly, influence, the, range, and, scope, of, animal, and, plant, life, that, can, survive, and, reproduce, in, these, environments, the, three, main, types, of, marsh, are, salt, marshes, freshwater, tidal, marshes, and, freshwater, marshes, these, three, can, be, found, worldwide, and, each, contains, a, different, set, of, organisms, saltwater, marshes, are, found, around, the, world, in, mid, to, high, latitudes, wherever, there, are, sections, of, protected, coastline, they, are, located, close, enough, to, the, shoreline, that, the, motion, of, the, tides, affects, them, and, sporadically, they, are, covered, with, water, they, flourish, where, the, rate, of, sediment, buildup, is, greater, than, the, rate, at, which, the, land, level, is, sinking, salt, marshes, are, dominated, by, specially, adapted, rooted, vegetation, primarily, salt, tolerant, grasses, salt, marshes, are, most, commonly, found, in, lagoons, estuaries, and, on, the, sheltered, side, of, a, shingle, or, sandspit, the, currents, there, carry, the, fine, particles, around, to, the, quiet, side, of, the, spit, and, sediment, begins, to, build, up, these, locations, allow, the, marshes, to, absorb, the, excess, nutrients, from, the, water, running, through, them, before, they, reach, the, oceans, and, estuaries, these, marshes, are, slowly, declining, coastal, development, and, urban, sprawl, have, caused, significant, loss, of, these, essential, habitats, although, considered, a, freshwater, marsh, the, ocean, tides, affect, this, form, of, marsh, however, without, the, stresses, of, salinity, at, work, in, its, saltwater, counterpart, the, diversity, of, the, plants, and, animals, that, live, in, and, use, freshwater, tidal, marshes, is, much, higher, than, in, salt, marshes, the, most, severe, threats, to, this, form, of, marsh, are, the, increasing, size, and, pollution, of, the, cities, surrounding, them, ranging, greatly, in, size, and, geographic, location, freshwater, marshes, make, up, north, america, s, most, common, form, of, wetland, they, are, also, the, most, diverse, of, the, three, types, of, marsh, some, examples, of, freshwater, marsh, types, in, north, america, are, wet, meadows, occur, in, shallow, lake, basins, low, lying, depressions, and, the, land, between, shallow, marshes, and, upland, areas, they, also, happen, on, the, edges, of, large, lakes, and, rivers, wet, meadows, often, have, very, high, plant, diversity, and, high, densities, of, buried, seeds, they, are, regularly, flooded, but, are, often, dry, in, the, summer, vernal, pools, are, a, type, of, marsh, found, only, seasonally, in, shallow, depressions, in, the, land, they, can, be, covered, in, shallow, water, but, in, the, summer, and, fall, they, can, be, completely, dry, in, western, north, america, vernal, pools, tend, to, form, in, open, grasslands, whereas, in, the, east, they, often, occur, in, forested, landscapes, further, south, vernal, pools, form, in, pine, savannas, and, flatwoods, many, amphibian, species, depend, upon, vernal, pools, for, spring, breeding, these, ponds, provide, a, habitat, free, from, fish, which, eat, the, eggs, and, young, of, amphibians, an, example, is, the, endangered, gopher, frog, similar, temporary, ponds, occur, in, other, world, ecosystems, where, they, may, have, local, names, however, vernal, pool, can, be, applied, to, all, such, temporary, pool, ecosystems, playa, lakes, are, a, form, of, shallow, freshwater, marsh, in, the, southern, high, plains, of, the, united, states, like, vernal, pools, they, are, only, present, at, certain, times, of, the, year, and, generally, have, a, circular, shape, as, the, playa, dries, during, the, summer, conspicuous, plant, zonation, develops, along, the, shoreline, prairie, potholes, are, found, in, northern, north, america, such, as, the, prairie, pothole, region, glaciers, once, covered, these, landscapes, and, as, a, result, shallow, depressions, were, formed, in, great, numbers, these, depressions, fill, with, water, in, the, spring, they, provide, important, breeding, habitats, for, many, species, of, waterfowl, some, pools, only, occur, seasonally, while, others, retain, enough, water, to, be, present, all, year, many, kinds, of, marsh, occur, along, the, fringes, of, large, rivers, the, different, types, are, produced, by, factors, such, as, water, level, nutrients, ice, scour, and, waves, large, tracts, of, tidal, marsh, have, been, embanked, and, artificially, drained, they, are, usually, known, by, the, dutch, name, of, polders, in, northern, germany, and, scandinavia, they, are, called, marschland, marsch, or, marsk, in, france, marais, maritime, in, the, netherlands, and, belgium, they, are, designated, as, marine, clay, districts, in, east, anglia, a, region, in, the, east, of, england, the, embanked, marshes, are, also, known, as, fens, some, areas, have, already, lost, 90, of, their, wetlands, including, marshes, they, have, been, drained, to, create, agricultural, land, or, filled, to, accommodate, urban, sprawl, restoration, is, returning, marshes, to, the, landscape, to, replace, those, lost, in, the, past, restoration, can, be, done, on, a, large, scale, such, as, by, allowing, rivers, to, flood, naturally, in, the, spring, or, on, a, small, scale, by, returning, wetlands, to, urban, landscapes
