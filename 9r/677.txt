the, triassic, jurassic, tr, j, extinction, event, tjme, often, called, the, end, triassic, extinction, was, a, mesozoic, extinction, event, that, marks, the, boundary, between, the, triassic, and, jurassic, periods, 201, 4, million, years, ago, and, is, one, of, the, top, five, major, extinction, events, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, profoundly, affecting, life, on, land, and, in, the, oceans, in, the, seas, the, entire, class, of, conodonts, and, 23, 34, of, marine, genera, disappeared, on, land, all, archosauromorphs, other, than, crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs, and, non, avian, dinosaurs, became, extinct, some, of, the, groups, which, died, out, were, previously, abundant, such, as, aetosaurs, phytosaurs, and, rauisuchids, some, remaining, non, mammalian, therapsids, and, many, of, the, large, temnospondyl, amphibians, had, become, extinct, prior, to, the, jurassic, as, well, however, there, is, still, much, uncertainty, regarding, a, connection, between, the, tr, j, boundary, and, terrestrial, vertebrates, due, to, a, lack, of, terrestrial, fossils, from, the, rhaetian, uppermost, stage, of, the, triassic, plants, crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, mammals, were, left, largely, untouched, this, allowed, the, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, crocodylomorphs, to, become, the, dominant, land, animals, for, the, next, 135, million, years, statistical, analysis, of, marine, losses, at, this, time, suggests, that, the, decrease, in, diversity, was, caused, more, by, a, decrease, in, speciation, than, by, an, increase, in, extinctions, nevertheless, a, pronounced, turnover, in, plant, spores, and, a, collapse, of, coral, reef, communities, indicates, that, an, ecological, catastrophe, did, occur, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, older, hypotheses, on, extinction, have, proposed, that, gradual, climate, or, sea, level, change, may, be, the, culprit, or, perhaps, one, or, more, asteroid, strikes, however, the, most, well, supported, and, widely, held, theory, for, the, cause, of, the, tr, j, extinction, places, the, blame, on, the, start, of, volcanic, eruptions, in, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, camp, which, was, responsible, for, outputting, a, high, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, into, earth, s, atmosphere, inducing, profound, global, warming, along, with, ocean, acidification, this, event, vacated, terrestrial, ecological, niches, allowing, the, dinosaurs, to, assume, the, dominant, roles, in, the, jurassic, period, this, event, happened, in, less, than, 10, 000, years, and, occurred, just, before, pangaea, started, to, break, apart, in, the, area, of, t, bingen, germany, a, triassic, jurassic, bonebed, can, be, found, which, is, characteristic, for, this, boundary, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, completed, the, transition, from, the, palaeozoic, evolutionary, fauna, to, the, modern, evolutionary, fauna, a, change, that, began, in, the, aftermath, of, the, end, guadalupian, extinction, and, continued, following, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, ptme, plankton, diversity, was, relatively, mildly, impacted, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, although, extinction, rates, among, radiolarians, rose, significantly, ammonites, were, affected, substantially, by, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, ceratitidans, the, most, prominent, group, of, ammonites, in, the, triassic, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, rhaetian, after, having, their, diversity, reduced, significantly, in, the, norian, other, ammonite, groups, such, as, the, ammonitina, lytoceratina, and, phylloceratina, diversified, from, the, early, jurassic, onward, bivalves, experienced, high, extinction, rates, during, the, early, and, middle, rhaetian, the, lilliput, effect, affected, megalodontid, bivalves, whereas, file, shell, bivalves, experienced, the, brobdingnag, effect, the, reverse, of, the, lilliput, effect, as, a, result, of, the, mass, extinction, event, there, is, some, evidence, of, a, bivalve, cosmopolitanism, event, during, the, mass, extinction, additionally, following, the, tjme, mobile, bivalve, taxa, outnumbered, stationary, bivalve, taxa, gastropod, diversity, was, barely, affected, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, although, gastropods, gradually, suffered, numerous, losses, over, the, late, norian, and, rhaetian, during, the, leadup, to, the, tjme, brachiopods, declined, in, diversity, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, before, rediversifying, in, the, sinemurian, and, pliensbachian, bryozoans, particularly, taxa, that, lived, in, offshore, settings, had, already, been, in, decline, since, the, norian, and, suffered, further, losses, in, the, tjme, conulariids, seemingly, completely, died, out, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, around, 96, of, coral, genera, died, out, with, integrated, corals, being, especially, devastated, corals, practically, disappeared, from, the, tethys, ocean, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, except, for, its, northernmost, reaches, resulting, in, an, early, hettangian, coral, gap, there, is, good, evidence, for, a, collapse, in, the, reef, community, which, was, likely, driven, by, ocean, acidification, resulting, from, co, 2, supplied, to, the, atmosphere, by, the, camp, eruptions, most, evidence, points, to, a, relatively, fast, recovery, from, the, mass, extinction, benthic, ecosystems, recovered, far, more, rapidly, after, the, tjme, than, they, did, after, the, ptme, british, early, jurassic, benthic, marine, environments, display, a, relatively, rapid, recovery, that, began, almost, immediately, after, the, end, of, the, mass, extinction, despite, numerous, relapses, into, anoxic, conditions, during, the, earliest, jurassic, in, the, neuqu, n, basin, recovery, began, in, the, late, early, hettangian, and, lasted, until, a, new, biodiversity, equilibrium, in, the, late, hettangian, also, despite, recurrent, anoxic, episodes, large, bivalves, began, to, reappear, shortly, after, the, extinction, event, siliceous, sponges, dominated, the, immediate, aftermath, interval, thanks, to, the, enormous, influx, of, silica, into, the, oceans, from, the, weathering, of, the, camp, s, aerially, extensive, basalts, some, clades, recovered, more, slowly, than, others, however, as, exemplified, by, corals, and, their, disappearance, in, the, early, hettangian, fish, did, not, suffer, a, mass, extinction, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, the, late, triassic, in, general, did, experience, a, gradual, drop, in, actinopterygiian, diversity, after, an, evolutionary, explosion, in, the, middle, triassic, though, this, may, have, been, due, to, falling, sea, levels, or, the, carnian, pluvial, event, it, may, instead, be, a, result, of, sampling, bias, considering, that, middle, triassic, fish, have, been, more, extensively, studied, than, late, triassic, fish, despite, the, apparent, drop, in, diversity, neopterygiians, which, include, most, modern, bony, fish, suffered, less, than, more, primitive, actinopterygiians, indicating, a, biological, turnover, where, modern, groups, of, fish, started, to, supplant, earlier, groups, conodonts, which, were, prominent, index, fossils, throughout, the, paleozoic, and, triassic, finally, became, extinct, at, the, t, j, boundary, following, declining, diversity, like, fish, marine, reptiles, experienced, a, substantial, drop, in, diversity, between, the, middle, triassic, and, the, jurassic, however, their, extinction, rate, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, was, not, elevated, the, highest, extinction, rates, experienced, by, mesozoic, marine, reptiles, actually, occurred, at, the, end, of, the, ladinian, stage, which, corresponds, to, the, end, of, the, middle, triassic, the, only, marine, reptile, families, which, became, extinct, at, or, slightly, before, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, were, the, placochelyids, the, last, family, of, placodonts, making, plesiosaurs, the, only, surviving, sauropterygians, and, giant, ichthyosaurs, such, as, shastasaurids, nevertheless, some, authors, have, argued, that, the, end, of, the, triassic, acted, as, a, genetic, bottleneck, for, ichthyosaurs, which, never, regained, the, level, of, anatomical, diversity, and, disparity, which, they, possessed, during, the, triassic, the, high, diversity, of, rhomaelosaurids, immediately, after, the, tjme, points, to, a, gradual, extinction, of, marine, reptiles, rather, than, an, abrupt, one, terrestrial, fauna, was, affected, by, the, tjme, much, more, severely, than, marine, fauna, one, of, the, earliest, pieces, of, evidence, for, a, late, triassic, extinction, was, a, major, turnover, in, terrestrial, tetrapods, such, as, amphibians, reptiles, and, synapsids, edwin, h, colbert, drew, parallels, between, the, system, of, extinction, and, adaptation, between, the, triassic, jurassic, and, cretaceous, paleogene, boundaries, he, recognized, how, dinosaurs, lepidosaurs, lizards, and, their, relatives, and, crocodyliforms, crocodilians, and, their, relatives, filled, the, niches, of, more, ancient, groups, of, amphibians, and, reptiles, which, were, extinct, by, the, start, of, the, jurassic, olsen, 1987, estimated, that, 42, of, all, terrestrial, tetrapods, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, based, on, his, studies, of, faunal, changes, in, the, newark, supergroup, of, eastern, north, america, more, modern, studies, have, debated, whether, the, turnover, in, triassic, tetrapods, was, abrupt, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, or, instead, more, gradual, during, the, triassic, amphibians, were, mainly, represented, by, large, crocodile, like, members, of, the, order, temnospondyli, although, the, earliest, lissamphibians, modern, amphibians, like, frogs, and, salamanders, did, appear, during, the, triassic, they, would, become, more, common, in, the, jurassic, while, the, temnospondyls, diminished, in, diversity, past, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, although, the, decline, of, temnospondyls, did, send, shockwaves, through, freshwater, ecosystems, it, was, probably, not, as, abrupt, as, some, authors, have, suggested, brachyopoids, for, example, survived, until, the, cretaceous, according, to, new, discoveries, in, the, 1990s, several, temnospondyl, groups, did, become, extinct, near, the, end, of, the, triassic, despite, earlier, abundance, but, it, is, uncertain, how, close, their, extinctions, were, to, the, end, of, the, triassic, the, last, known, metoposaurids, apachesaurus, were, from, the, redonda, formation, which, may, have, been, early, rhaetian, or, late, norian, gerrothorax, the, last, known, plagiosaurid, has, been, found, in, rocks, which, are, probably, but, not, certainly, rhaetian, while, a, capitosaur, humerus, was, found, in, rhaetian, age, deposits, in, 2018, therefore, plagiosaurids, and, capitosaurs, were, likely, victims, of, an, extinction, at, the, very, end, of, the, triassic, while, most, other, temnospondyls, were, already, extinct, terrestrial, reptile, faunas, were, dominated, by, archosauromorphs, during, the, triassic, particularly, phytosaurs, and, members, of, pseudosuchia, the, reptile, lineage, which, leads, to, modern, crocodilians, in, the, early, jurassic, and, onwards, dinosaurs, and, pterosaurs, became, the, most, common, land, reptiles, while, small, reptiles, were, mostly, represented, by, lepidosauromorphs, such, as, lizards, and, tuatara, relatives, among, pseudosuchians, only, small, crocodylomorphs, did, not, become, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, triassic, with, both, dominant, herbivorous, subgroups, such, as, aetosaurs, and, carnivorous, ones, rauisuchids, having, died, out, phytosaurs, drepanosaurs, trilophosaurids, tanystropheids, and, procolophonids, which, were, other, common, reptiles, in, the, late, triassic, had, also, become, extinct, by, the, start, of, the, jurassic, however, pinpointing, the, extinction, of, these, different, land, reptile, groups, is, difficult, as, the, last, stage, of, the, triassic, the, rhaetian, and, the, first, stage, of, the, jurassic, the, hettangian, each, have, few, records, of, large, land, animals, some, paleontologists, have, considered, only, phytosaurs, and, procolophonids, to, have, become, extinct, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, with, other, groups, having, become, extinct, earlier, however, it, is, likely, that, many, other, groups, survived, up, until, the, boundary, according, to, british, fissure, deposits, from, the, rhaetian, aetosaurs, kuehneosaurids, drepanosaurs, thecodontosaurids, saltoposuchids, like, terrestrisuchus, trilophosaurids, and, various, non, crocodylomorph, pseudosuchians, are, all, examples, of, rhaetian, reptiles, which, may, have, become, extinct, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, herbivorous, insects, were, minimally, affected, by, the, tjme, evidence, from, the, sichuan, basin, shows, they, were, overall, able, to, quickly, adapt, to, the, floristic, turnover, by, exploiting, newly, abundant, plants, the, extinction, event, marks, a, floral, turnover, as, well, with, estimates, of, the, percentage, of, rhaetian, pre, extinction, plants, being, lost, ranging, from, 17, to, 73, though, spore, turnovers, are, observed, across, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, the, abruptness, of, this, transition, and, the, relative, abundances, of, given, spore, types, both, before, and, after, the, boundary, are, highly, variable, from, one, region, to, another, pointing, to, a, global, ecological, restructuring, rather, than, a, mass, extinction, of, plants, overall, plants, suffered, minor, diversity, losses, on, a, global, scale, as, a, result, of, the, extinction, but, species, turnover, rates, were, high, and, substantial, changes, occurred, in, terms, of, relative, abundance, and, growth, distribution, among, taxa, evidence, from, central, europe, suggests, that, rather, than, a, sharp, very, rapid, decline, followed, by, an, adaptive, radiation, a, more, gradual, turnover, in, both, fossil, plants, and, spores, with, several, intermediate, stages, is, observed, over, the, course, of, the, extinction, event, extinction, of, plant, species, can, in, part, be, explained, by, the, suspected, increased, carbon, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, as, a, result, of, camp, volcanic, activity, which, would, have, created, photoinhibition, and, decreased, transpiration, levels, among, species, with, low, photosynthetic, plasticity, such, as, the, broad, leaved, ginkgoales, which, declined, to, near, extinction, across, the, tr, j, boundary, ferns, and, other, species, with, dissected, leaves, displayed, greater, adaptability, to, atmosphere, conditions, of, the, extinction, event, and, in, some, instances, were, able, to, proliferate, across, the, boundary, and, into, the, jurassic, in, the, jiyuan, basin, of, north, china, classopolis, content, increased, drastically, in, concordance, with, warming, drying, wildfire, activity, enrichments, in, isotopically, light, carbon, and, an, overall, reduction, in, floral, diversity, in, the, sichuan, basin, relatively, cool, mixed, forests, in, the, late, rhaetian, were, replaced, by, hot, arid, fernlands, during, the, triassic, jurassic, transition, which, in, turn, later, gave, way, to, a, cheirolepid, dominated, flora, in, the, hettangian, and, sinemurian, the, abundance, of, ferns, in, china, that, were, resistant, to, high, levels, of, aridity, increased, significantly, across, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, though, ferns, better, adapted, for, moist, humid, environments, declined, indicating, that, plants, experienced, major, environmental, stress, albeit, not, an, outright, mass, extinction, in, some, regions, however, major, floral, extinctions, did, occur, with, some, researchers, challenging, the, hypothesis, of, there, being, no, significant, floral, mass, extinction, on, this, basis, in, the, newark, supergroup, of, the, united, states, east, coast, about, 60, of, the, diverse, monosaccate, and, bisaccate, pollen, assemblages, disappear, at, the, tr, j, boundary, indicating, a, major, extinction, of, plant, genera, early, jurassic, pollen, assemblages, are, dominated, by, corollina, a, new, genus, that, took, advantage, of, the, empty, niches, left, by, the, extinction, the, site, of, st, audrie, s, bay, displays, a, shift, from, diverse, gymnosperm, dominated, forests, to, cheirolepidiaceae, dominated, monocultures, the, danish, basin, saw, 34, of, its, rhaetian, spore, pollen, assemblage, including, cingulizonates, rhaeticus, limbosporites, lundbladiae, polypodiisporites, polymicroforatus, and, ricciisporites, tuberculatus, disappear, with, the, post, extinction, plant, community, being, dominated, by, pinacean, conifers, such, as, pinuspollenites, minimus, and, tree, ferns, such, as, deltoidospora, with, ginkgos, cycads, cypresses, and, corystospermous, seed, ferns, also, represented, along, the, margins, of, the, european, epicontinental, sea, and, the, european, shores, of, the, tethys, coastal, and, near, coastal, mires, fell, victim, to, an, abrupt, sea, level, rise, these, mires, were, replaced, by, a, pioneering, opportunistic, flora, after, an, abrupt, sea, level, fall, although, its, heyday, was, short, lived, and, it, died, out, shortly, after, its, rise, the, opportunists, that, established, themselves, along, the, tethyan, coastline, were, primarily, spore, producers, in, the, eiberg, basin, of, the, northern, calcareous, alps, there, was, a, very, rapid, palynomorph, turnover, the, palynological, and, palaeobotanical, succession, in, queensland, shows, a, classopolis, bloom, after, the, tjme, polyploidy, may, have, been, an, important, factor, that, mitigated, a, conifer, species, risk, of, going, extinct, gradual, climate, change, sea, level, fluctuations, or, a, pulse, of, oceanic, acidification, during, the, late, triassic, may, have, reached, a, tipping, point, however, the, effect, of, such, processes, on, triassic, animal, and, plant, groups, is, not, well, understood, the, extinctions, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, were, initially, attributed, to, gradually, changing, environments, within, his, 1958, study, recognizing, biological, turnover, between, the, triassic, and, jurassic, edwin, h, colbert, s, proposal, was, that, this, extinction, was, a, result, of, geological, processes, decreasing, the, diversity, of, land, biomes, he, considered, the, triassic, period, to, be, an, era, of, the, world, experiencing, a, variety, of, environments, from, towering, highlands, to, arid, deserts, to, tropical, marshes, in, contrast, the, jurassic, period, was, much, more, uniform, both, in, climate, and, elevation, due, to, excursions, by, shallow, seas, later, studies, noted, a, clear, trend, towards, increased, aridification, towards, the, end, of, the, triassic, although, high, latitude, areas, like, greenland, and, australia, actually, became, wetter, most, of, the, world, experienced, more, drastic, changes, in, climate, as, indicated, by, geological, evidence, this, evidence, includes, an, increase, in, carbonate, and, evaporite, deposits, which, are, most, abundant, in, dry, climates, and, a, decrease, in, coal, deposits, which, primarily, form, in, humid, environments, such, as, coal, forests, in, addition, the, climate, may, have, become, much, more, seasonal, with, long, droughts, interrupted, by, severe, monsoons, the, world, gradually, got, warmer, over, this, time, as, well, from, the, late, norian, to, the, rhaetian, mean, annual, temperatures, rose, by, 7, to, 9, c, the, site, of, hochalm, in, austria, preserves, evidence, of, carbon, cycle, perturbations, during, the, rhaetian, preceding, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, potentially, having, a, role, in, the, ecological, crisis, geological, formations, in, europe, seem, to, indicate, a, drop, in, sea, levels, in, the, late, triassic, and, then, a, rise, in, the, early, jurassic, although, falling, sea, levels, have, sometimes, been, considered, a, culprit, for, marine, extinctions, evidence, is, inconclusive, since, many, sea, level, drops, in, geological, history, are, not, correlated, with, increased, extinctions, however, there, is, still, some, evidence, that, marine, life, was, affected, by, secondary, processes, related, to, falling, sea, levels, such, as, decreased, oxygenation, caused, by, sluggish, circulation, or, increased, acidification, these, processes, do, not, seem, to, have, been, worldwide, with, the, sea, level, fall, observed, in, european, sediments, believed, to, be, not, global, but, regional, but, they, may, explain, local, extinctions, in, european, marine, fauna, a, pronounced, sea, level, in, latest, triassic, records, from, lake, williston, in, northeastern, british, columbia, which, was, then, the, northeastern, margin, of, panthalassa, resulted, in, an, extinction, event, of, infaunal, sediment, dwelling, bivalves, though, not, epifaunal, ones, some, have, hypothesized, that, an, impact, from, an, asteroid, or, comet, caused, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, similar, to, the, extraterrestrial, object, which, was, the, main, factor, in, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, about, 66, million, years, ago, as, evidenced, by, the, chicxulub, crater, in, mexico, however, so, far, no, impact, crater, of, sufficient, size, has, been, dated, to, precisely, coincide, with, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, nevertheless, the, late, triassic, did, experience, several, impacts, including, the, second, largest, confirmed, impact, in, the, mesozoic, the, manicouagan, reservoir, in, quebec, is, one, of, the, most, visible, large, impact, craters, on, earth, and, at, 100, km, 62, mi, in, diameter, it, is, tied, with, the, eocene, popigai, impact, structure, in, siberia, as, the, fourth, largest, impact, crater, on, earth, olsen, et, al, 1987, were, the, first, scientists, to, link, the, manicouagan, crater, to, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, citing, its, age, which, at, the, time, was, roughly, considered, to, be, late, triassic, more, precise, radiometric, dating, by, hodych, dunning, 1992, has, shown, that, the, manicouagan, impact, occurred, about, 214, million, years, ago, about, 13, million, years, before, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, therefore, it, could, not, have, been, responsible, for, an, extinction, precisely, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, nevertheless, the, manicouagan, impact, did, have, a, widespread, effect, on, the, planet, a, 214, million, year, old, ejecta, blanket, of, shocked, quartz, has, been, found, in, rock, layers, as, far, away, as, england, and, japan, there, is, still, a, possibility, that, the, manicouagan, impact, was, responsible, for, a, small, extinction, midway, through, the, late, triassic, at, the, carnian, norian, boundary, although, the, disputed, age, of, this, boundary, and, whether, an, extinction, actually, occurred, in, the, first, place, makes, it, difficult, to, correlate, the, impact, with, extinction, onoue, et, al, 2016, alternatively, proposed, that, the, manicouagan, impact, was, responsible, for, a, marine, extinction, in, the, middle, of, the, norian, which, affected, radiolarians, sponges, conodonts, and, triassic, ammonoids, thus, the, manicouagan, impact, may, have, been, partially, responsible, for, the, gradual, decline, in, the, latter, two, groups, which, culminated, in, their, extinction, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, the, boundary, between, the, adamanian, and, revueltian, land, vertebrate, faunal, zones, which, involved, extinctions, and, faunal, changes, in, tetrapods, and, plants, was, possibly, also, caused, by, the, manicouagan, impact, although, discrepancies, between, magnetochronological, and, isotopic, dating, lead, to, some, uncertainty, other, triassic, craters, are, closer, to, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, but, also, much, smaller, than, the, manicouagan, reservoir, the, eroded, rochechouart, impact, structure, in, france, has, most, recently, been, dated, to, 201, 2, million, years, ago, but, at, 25, km, 16, mi, across, possibly, up, to, 50, km, 30, mi, across, originally, it, appears, to, be, too, small, to, have, affected, the, ecosystem, although, it, has, been, speculated, to, have, played, a, role, in, an, alleged, much, smaller, extinction, event, at, the, norian, rhaetian, boundary, the, 40, km, 25, mi, wide, saint, martin, crater, in, manitoba, has, been, proposed, as, a, candidate, for, a, possible, tjme, causing, impact, but, its, has, since, been, dated, to, be, carnian, other, putative, or, confirmed, triassic, craters, include, the, 80, km, 50, mi, wide, puchezh, katunki, crater, in, eastern, russia, though, it, may, be, jurassic, in, age, the, 15, km, 9, mi, wide, obolon, crater, in, ukraine, and, the, 9, km, 6, mi, wide, red, wing, creek, structure, in, north, dakota, spray, et, al, 1998, noted, an, interesting, phenomenon, that, being, how, the, manicouagan, rochechouart, and, saint, martin, craters, all, seem, to, be, at, the, same, latitude, and, that, the, obolon, and, red, wing, craters, form, parallel, arcs, with, the, rochechouart, and, saint, martin, craters, respectively, spray, and, his, colleagues, hypothesized, that, the, triassic, experienced, a, multiple, impact, event, a, large, fragmented, asteroid, or, comet, which, broke, up, and, impacted, the, earth, in, several, places, at, the, same, time, such, an, impact, has, been, observed, in, the, present, day, when, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, broke, up, and, hit, jupiter, in, 1992, however, the, multiple, impact, event, hypothesis, for, triassic, impact, craters, has, not, been, well, supported, kent, 1998, noted, that, the, manicouagan, and, rochechouart, craters, were, formed, in, eras, of, different, magnetic, polarity, and, radiometric, dating, of, the, individual, craters, has, shown, that, the, impacts, occurred, millions, of, years, apart, shocked, quartz, has, been, found, in, rhaetian, deposits, from, the, northern, apennines, of, italy, providing, possible, evidence, of, an, end, triassic, extraterrestrial, impact, certain, trace, metals, indicative, of, a, bolide, impact, have, been, found, in, the, late, rhaetian, though, not, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, itself, the, discoverers, of, these, trace, metal, anomalies, purport, that, such, a, bolide, impact, could, only, have, been, an, indirect, cause, of, the, tjme, the, discovery, of, seismites, two, to, four, metres, thick, coeval, with, the, carbon, isotope, fluctuations, associated, with, the, tjme, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, a, possible, bolide, impact, although, no, definitive, link, between, these, seismites, and, any, impact, event, has, been, found, on, the, other, hand, the, dissimilarity, between, the, isotopic, perturbations, characterising, the, tjme, and, those, characterising, the, end, cretaceous, mass, extinction, makes, an, extraterrestrial, impact, highly, unlikely, to, have, been, the, cause, of, the, tjme, according, to, many, researchers, various, trace, metal, ratios, including, palladium, iridium, platinum, iridium, and, platinum, rhodium, in, rocks, deposited, during, the, tjme, have, numerical, values, very, different, from, what, would, be, expected, in, an, extraterrestrial, impact, scenario, providing, further, evidence, against, this, hypothesis, the, leading, and, best, evidenced, explanation, for, the, tjme, is, massive, volcanic, eruptions, specifically, from, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, camp, the, largest, known, large, igneous, province, by, area, and, one, of, the, most, voluminous, with, its, flood, basalts, extending, across, parts, of, southwestern, europe, northwestern, africa, northeastern, south, america, and, southeastern, north, america, the, coincidence, and, synchrony, of, camp, activity, and, the, tjme, is, indicated, by, uranium, lead, dating, argon, argon, dating, and, palaeomagnetism, the, isotopic, composition, of, fossil, soils, and, marine, sediments, near, the, boundary, between, the, late, triassic, and, early, jurassic, has, been, tied, to, a, large, negative, 13, c, excursion, with, values, as, low, as, 2, 8, carbon, isotopes, of, hydrocarbons, n, alkanes, derived, from, leaf, wax, and, lignin, and, total, organic, carbon, from, two, sections, of, lake, sediments, interbedded, with, the, camp, in, eastern, north, america, have, shown, carbon, isotope, excursions, similar, to, those, found, in, the, mostly, marine, st, audrie, s, bay, section, somerset, england, the, correlation, suggests, that, the, end, triassic, extinction, event, began, at, the, same, time, in, marine, and, terrestrial, environments, slightly, before, the, oldest, basalts, in, eastern, north, america, but, simultaneous, with, the, eruption, of, the, oldest, flows, in, morocco, also, suggested, by, deenen, et, al, 2010, with, both, a, critical, co, 2, greenhouse, and, a, marine, biocalcification, crisis, contemporaneous, camp, eruptions, mass, extinction, and, the, carbon, isotopic, excursions, are, shown, in, the, same, places, making, the, case, for, a, volcanic, cause, of, a, mass, extinction, the, observed, negative, carbon, isotope, excursion, is, lower, in, some, sites, that, correspond, to, what, was, then, eastern, panthalassa, because, of, the, extreme, aridity, of, western, pangaea, limiting, weathering, and, erosion, there, the, negative, cie, associated, with, camp, volcanism, lasted, for, approximately, 20, 000, to, 40, 000, years, or, about, one, or, two, of, earth, s, axial, precession, cycles, although, the, carbon, cycle, was, so, disrupted, that, it, did, not, stabilise, until, the, sinemurian, mercury, anomalies, from, deposits, in, various, parts, of, the, world, have, further, bolstered, the, volcanic, cause, hypothesis, as, have, anomalies, from, various, platinum, group, elements, nickel, enrichments, are, also, observed, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, coevally, with, light, carbon, enrichments, providing, yet, more, evidence, of, massive, volcanism, some, scientists, initially, rejected, the, volcanic, eruption, theory, because, the, newark, supergroup, a, section, of, rock, in, eastern, north, america, that, records, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, contains, no, ash, fall, horizons, and, its, oldest, basalt, flows, were, estimated, to, lie, around, 10, m, above, the, transition, zone, however, updated, dating, protocol, and, wider, sampling, has, confirmed, that, the, camp, eruptions, started, in, morocco, only, a, few, thousand, years, before, the, extinction, preceding, their, onset, in, nova, scotia, and, new, jersey, and, that, they, continued, in, several, more, pulses, for, the, next, 600, 000, years, volcanic, global, warming, has, also, been, criticised, as, an, explanation, because, some, estimates, have, found, that, the, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, emitted, was, only, around, 250, ppm, not, enough, to, generate, a, mass, extinction, in, addition, at, some, sites, changes, in, carbon, isotope, ratios, have, been, attributed, to, diagenesis, and, not, any, primary, environmental, changes, the, flood, basalts, of, the, camp, released, gigantic, quantities, of, carbon, dioxide, a, potent, greenhouse, gas, causing, intense, global, warming, before, the, end, triassic, extinction, carbon, dioxide, levels, were, around, 1, 000, ppm, as, measured, by, the, stomatal, index, of, lepidopteris, ottonis, but, this, quantity, jumped, to, 1, 300, ppm, at, the, onset, of, the, extinction, event, during, the, tjme, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, increased, fourfold, the, record, of, camp, degassing, shows, several, distinct, pulses, of, carbon, dioxide, immediately, following, each, major, pulse, of, magmatism, at, least, two, of, which, amount, to, a, doubling, of, atmospheric, co, 2, carbon, dioxide, was, emitted, quickly, and, in, enormous, quantities, compared, to, other, periods, of, earth, s, history, rate, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, was, one, of, the, most, meteoric, rises, in, carbon, dioxide, levels, in, earth, s, entire, history, it, is, estimated, that, a, single, volcanic, pulse, from, the, large, igneous, province, would, have, emitted, an, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, roughly, equivalent, to, projected, anthropogenic, carbon, dioxide, emissions, for, the, 21st, century, in, addition, the, flood, basalts, intruded, through, sediments, that, were, rich, in, organic, matter, and, combusted, it, which, led, to, the, degassing, of, volatiles, that, further, enhanced, volcanic, warming, of, the, climate, thermogenic, carbon, release, through, such, contact, metamorphism, of, carbon, rich, deposits, has, been, found, to, be, a, sensible, hypothesis, providing, a, coherent, explanation, for, the, magnitude, of, the, negative, carbon, isotope, excursions, at, the, terminus, of, the, triassic, global, temperatures, rose, sharply, by, 3, to, 4, c, in, some, regions, the, temperature, rise, was, as, great, as, 10, c, kaolinite, dominated, clay, mineral, spectra, reflect, the, extremely, hot, and, humid, greenhouse, conditions, engendered, by, the, camp, soil, erosion, occurred, as, the, hydrological, cycle, was, accelerated, by, the, extreme, global, heat, the, catastrophic, dissociation, of, gas, hydrates, as, a, positive, feedback, resulting, from, warming, which, has, been, suggested, as, one, possible, cause, of, the, ptme, the, largest, mass, extinction, of, all, time, may, have, exacerbated, greenhouse, conditions, although, others, suggest, that, methane, hydrate, release, was, temporally, mismatched, with, the, tjme, and, thus, not, a, cause, of, it, besides, the, carbon, dioxide, driven, long, term, global, warming, camp, volcanism, had, shorter, term, cooling, effects, resulting, from, the, emission, of, sulphur, dioxide, aerosols, a, 2022, study, shows, that, high, latitudes, had, colder, climates, with, evidence, of, mild, glaciation, the, authors, propose, that, cold, periods, ice, ages, induced, by, volcanic, ejecta, clouding, the, atmosphere, might, have, favoured, endothermic, animals, with, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, mammals, being, more, capable, at, enduring, these, conditions, than, large, pseudosuchians, due, to, insulation, camp, volcanism, released, enormous, amounts, of, toxic, mercury, the, appearance, of, high, rates, of, mutaganesis, of, varying, severity, in, fossil, spores, during, the, tjme, coincides, with, mercury, anomalies, and, is, thus, believed, by, researchers, to, have, been, caused, by, mercury, poisoning, 202, hg, and, 199, hg, evidence, suggests, that, volcanism, caused, the, mercury, loading, directly, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, but, that, there, were, later, bouts, of, elevated, mercury, in, the, environment, during, the, early, jurassic, caused, by, eccentricity, forced, enhancement, of, hydrological, cycling, and, erosion, that, resulted, in, remobilisation, of, volcanically, injected, mercury, that, had, been, deposited, in, wetlands, the, intense, rapid, warming, is, believed, to, have, resulted, in, increased, storminess, and, lightning, activity, as, a, consequence, of, the, more, humid, climate, the, uptick, in, lightning, activity, is, in, turn, implicated, as, a, cause, of, an, increase, in, wildfire, activity, the, combined, presence, of, charcoal, fragments, and, heightened, levels, of, pyrolytic, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, in, polish, sedimentary, facies, straddling, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, indicates, wildfires, were, extremely, commonplace, during, the, earliest, jurassic, immediately, after, the, triassic, jurassic, transition, elevated, wildfire, activity, is, also, known, from, the, junggar, basin, in, the, jiyuan, basin, two, distinct, pulses, of, drastically, elevated, wildfire, activity, are, known, the, first, mainly, affected, canopies, and, occurred, amidst, relatively, humid, conditions, while, the, second, predominantly, affected, ground, cover, and, was, associated, with, aridity, frequent, wildfires, combined, with, increased, seismic, activity, from, camp, emplacement, led, to, apocalyptic, soil, degradation, in, addition, to, these, climatic, effects, oceanic, uptake, of, volcanogenic, carbon, and, sulphur, dioxide, would, have, led, to, a, significant, decrease, of, seawater, ph, known, as, ocean, acidification, which, is, discussed, as, a, relevant, driver, of, marine, extinction, evidence, for, ocean, acidification, as, an, extinction, mechanism, comes, from, the, preferential, extinction, of, marine, organisms, with, thick, aragonitic, skeletons, and, little, biotic, control, of, biocalcification, e, g, corals, hypercalcifying, sponges, which, resulted, in, a, coral, reef, collapse, and, an, early, hettangian, coral, gap, extensive, fossil, remains, of, malformed, calcareous, nannoplankton, a, common, sign, of, significant, drops, in, ph, have, also, been, extensively, reported, from, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, global, interruption, of, carbonate, deposition, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, has, been, cited, as, additional, evidence, for, catastrophic, ocean, acidification, upwardly, developing, aragonite, fans, in, the, shallow, subseafloor, may, also, reflect, decreased, ph, these, structures, being, speculated, to, have, precipitated, concomitantly, with, acidification, in, some, studied, sections, the, tjme, biocalcification, crisis, is, masked, by, emersion, of, carbonate, platforms, induced, by, marine, regression, anoxia, was, another, mechanism, of, extinction, the, end, triassic, extinction, was, coeval, with, an, uptick, in, black, shale, deposition, and, a, pronounced, negative, 238, u, excursion, indicating, a, major, decrease, in, marine, oxygen, availability, isorenieratane, concentration, increase, reveals, that, populations, of, green, sulphur, bacteria, which, photosynthesise, using, hydrogen, sulphide, instead, of, water, grew, significantly, across, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, these, findings, indicate, that, euxinia, a, form, of, anoxia, defined, by, not, just, the, absence, of, dissolved, oxygen, but, high, concentrations, of, hydrogen, sulphide, also, developed, in, the, oceans, a, meteoric, shift, towards, positive, sulphur, isotope, ratios, in, reduced, sulphur, species, indicates, a, complete, utilisation, of, sulphate, by, sulphate, reducing, bacteria, evidence, of, anoxia, has, been, discovered, at, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, across, the, world, s, oceans, the, western, tethys, eastern, tethys, and, panthalassa, were, all, affected, by, a, precipitous, drop, in, seawater, oxygen, although, at, a, few, sites, the, tjme, was, associated, with, fully, oxygenated, waters, positive, 15, n, excursions, have, also, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, anoxia, concomitant, with, increased, denitrification, in, marine, sediments, in, the, tjme, s, aftermath, in, northeastern, panthalassa, episodes, of, anoxia, and, euxinia, were, already, occurring, during, the, rhaetian, before, the, tjme, making, its, marine, ecosystems, unstable, even, before, the, main, crisis, began, this, early, phase, of, environmental, degradation, in, eastern, panthalassa, may, have, been, caused, by, an, early, phase, of, camp, activity, anoxic, reducing, conditions, were, likewise, present, in, western, panthalassa, off, the, coast, of, what, is, now, japan, for, about, a, million, years, prior, to, the, tjme, during, the, tjme, the, rapid, warming, and, increase, in, continental, weathering, led, to, the, stagnation, of, ocean, circulation, and, deoxygenation, of, seawater, in, many, ocean, regions, causing, catastrophic, marine, environmental, effects, in, conjunction, with, ocean, acidification, which, was, enhanced, and, exacerbated, by, widespread, photic, zone, euxinia, through, organic, matter, respiration, and, carbon, dioxide, release, off, the, shores, of, the, wrangellia, terrane, the, onset, of, photic, zone, euxinia, was, preceded, by, an, interval, of, limited, nitrogen, availability, and, increased, nitrogen, fixation, in, surface, waters, while, euxinia, developed, in, bottom, waters, in, what, is, now, northwestern, europe, shallow, seas, became, salinity, stratified, enabling, easy, development, of, anoxia, reduced, salinity, in, conjunction, with, increased, influx, of, terrestrial, organic, matter, enkindled, anoxia, in, the, eiberg, basin, the, persistence, of, anoxia, into, the, hettangian, age, may, have, helped, delay, the, recovery, of, marine, life, in, the, extinction, s, aftermath, and, recurrent, hydrogen, sulphide, poisoning, likely, had, the, same, retarding, effect, on, biotic, rediversification, research, on, the, role, of, ozone, shield, deterioration, during, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, has, suggested, that, it, may, have, been, a, factor, in, the, tjme, as, well, a, spike, in, the, abundance, of, unseparated, tetrads, of, kraeuselisporites, reissingerii, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, increased, ultraviolet, radiation, flux, resulting, from, ozone, layer, damage, caused, by, volcanic, aerosols, the, extremely, rapid, centuries, long, timescale, of, carbon, emissions, and, global, warming, caused, by, pulses, of, camp, volcanism, has, drawn, comparisons, between, the, triassic, jurassic, mass, extinction, and, anthropogenic, global, warming, currently, causing, the, holocene, extinction, the, current, rate, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, is, around, 50, gigatonnes, per, year, hundreds, of, times, faster, than, during, the, latest, triassic, although, the, lack, of, extremely, detailed, stratigraphic, resolution, and, pulsed, nature, of, camp, volcanism, means, that, individual, pulses, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, likely, occurred, on, comparable, timescales, to, human, release, of, warming, gases, since, the, industrial, revolution, the, degassing, rate, of, the, first, pulse, of, camp, volcanism, is, estimated, to, have, been, around, half, of, the, rate, of, modern, anthropogenic, emissions, palaeontologists, studying, the, tjme, and, its, impacts, warn, that, a, major, reduction, in, humanity, s, carbon, dioxide, emissions, to, slow, down, climate, change, is, of, critical, importance, for, preventing, a, catastrophe, similar, to, the, tjme, from, befalling, the, modern, biosphere, if, human, induced, climate, change, persists, as, is, predictions, can, be, made, as, to, how, various, aspects, of, the, biosphere, will, respond, based, on, records, of, the, tjme, for, example, current, conditions, such, the, increased, carbon, dioxide, levels, ocean, acidification, and, ocean, deoxygenation, create, a, similar, climate, to, that, of, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, for, marine, life, so, it, is, the, common, assumption, that, should, the, trends, continue, modern, reef, building, taxa, and, skeletal, benthic, organisms, will, be, preferentially, impacted
