the, zodiac, is, a, belt, shaped, region, of, the, sky, that, extends, approximately, 8, north, and, south, as, measured, in, celestial, latitude, of, the, ecliptic, the, apparent, path, of, the, sun, across, the, celestial, sphere, over, the, course, of, the, year, also, within, this, zodiac, belt, appear, the, moon, and, the, brightest, planets, along, their, orbital, planes, the, zodiac, is, divided, along, the, ecliptic, into, 12, equal, parts, signs, each, occupying, 30, of, celestial, longitude, these, signs, roughly, correspond, to, the, astronomical, constellations, with, the, following, modern, names, aries, taurus, gemini, cancer, leo, virgo, libra, scorpio, sagittarius, capricorn, aquarius, and, pisces, the, signs, have, been, used, to, determine, the, time, of, the, year, by, identifying, each, sign, with, the, days, of, the, year, the, sun, is, in, the, respective, sign, in, western, astrology, and, formerly, astronomy, the, time, of, each, sign, is, associated, with, different, attributes, though, the, zodiacal, system, and, its, angular, measurement, in, 360, sexagesimal, degree, originated, with, babylonian, astronomy, during, the, 1st, millennium, bc, it, was, only, then, communicated, into, greek, astronomy, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, as, well, as, into, developing, the, hindu, zodiac, due, to, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, time, of, year, that, the, sun, is, in, a, given, constellation, has, changed, since, babylonian, times, and, the, point, of, march, equinox, has, moved, from, aries, into, pisces, the, zodiac, forms, a, celestial, coordinate, system, or, more, specifically, an, ecliptic, coordinate, system, which, takes, the, ecliptic, as, the, origin, of, latitude, and, the, sun, s, position, at, vernal, equinox, as, the, origin, of, longitude, in, modern, astronomy, the, ecliptic, coordinate, system, is, still, used, for, tracking, solar, system, objects, the, english, word, zodiac, derives, from, z, diacus, the, latinized, form, of, the, ancient, greek, z, diak, s, k, klos, meaning, cycle, or, circle, of, little, animals, z, dion, is, the, diminutive, of, z, on, animal, the, name, reflects, the, prominence, of, animals, and, mythological, hybrids, among, the, twelve, signs, the, zodiac, was, in, use, by, the, roman, era, based, on, concepts, inherited, by, hellenistic, astronomy, from, babylonian, astronomy, of, the, chaldean, period, mid, 1st, millennium, bc, which, in, turn, derived, from, an, earlier, system, of, lists, of, stars, along, the, ecliptic, the, construction, of, the, zodiac, is, described, in, ptolemy, s, comprehensive, 2nd, century, ad, work, the, almagest, although, the, zodiac, remains, the, basis, of, the, ecliptic, coordinate, system, in, use, in, astronomy, besides, the, equatorial, one, the, term, and, the, names, of, the, twelve, signs, are, today, mostly, associated, with, horoscopic, astrology, the, term, zodiac, may, also, refer, to, the, region, of, the, celestial, sphere, encompassing, the, paths, of, the, planets, corresponding, to, the, band, of, about, 8, arc, degrees, above, and, below, the, ecliptic, the, zodiac, of, a, given, planet, is, the, band, that, contains, the, path, of, that, particular, body, e, g, the, zodiac, of, the, moon, is, the, band, of, 5, above, and, below, the, ecliptic, by, extension, the, zodiac, of, the, comets, may, refer, to, the, band, encompassing, most, short, period, comets, as, early, as, the, 14th, century, bc, a, complete, list, of, the, 36, egyptian, decans, was, placed, among, the, hieroglyphs, adorning, the, tomb, of, seti, i, they, figured, again, in, the, temple, of, ramesses, ii, and, characterize, every, egyptian, astrological, monument, both, the, famous, zodiacs, of, dendera, display, their, symbols, identified, by, karl, richard, lepsius, the, division, of, the, ecliptic, into, the, zodiacal, signs, originates, in, babylonian, astronomy, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, the, zodiac, draws, on, stars, in, earlier, babylonian, star, catalogues, such, as, the, mul, apin, catalogue, which, was, compiled, around, 1000, bc, some, constellations, can, be, traced, even, further, back, to, bronze, age, old, babylonian, empire, sources, including, gemini, the, twins, from, sumerian, romanized, mul, ma, tab, ba, gal, gal, the, great, twins, cancer, the, crab, from, sumerian, romanized, mul, al, lul, the, crayfish, among, others, around, the, end, of, the, fifth, century, bc, babylonian, astronomers, divided, the, ecliptic, into, 12, equal, signs, by, analogy, to, 12, schematic, months, of, 30, days, each, each, sign, contained, 30, of, celestial, longitude, thus, creating, the, first, known, celestial, coordinate, system, according, to, calculations, by, modern, astrophysics, the, zodiac, was, introduced, between, 409, and, 398, bc, during, persian, rule, and, probably, within, a, very, few, years, of, 401, bc, unlike, modern, astrologers, who, place, the, beginning, of, the, sign, of, aries, at, the, position, of, the, sun, at, the, vernal, equinox, in, the, northern, hemisphere, march, equinox, babylonian, astronomers, fixed, the, zodiac, in, relation, to, stars, placing, the, beginning, of, cancer, at, the, rear, twin, star, geminorum, and, the, beginning, of, aquarius, at, the, rear, star, of, the, goat, fish, capricorni, due, to, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, time, of, year, the, sun, is, in, a, given, constellation, has, changed, since, babylonian, times, as, the, point, of, march, equinox, has, moved, from, aries, into, pisces, because, the, divisions, were, made, into, equal, arcs, of, 30, each, they, constituted, an, ideal, system, of, reference, for, making, predictions, about, a, planet, s, longitude, however, babylonian, techniques, of, observational, measurements, were, in, a, rudimentary, stage, of, evolution, they, measured, the, position, of, a, planet, in, reference, to, a, set, of, normal, stars, close, to, the, ecliptic, 9, of, latitude, the, normal, stars, were, used, as, observational, reference, points, to, help, position, a, planet, within, this, ecliptic, coordinate, system, in, babylonian, astronomical, diaries, a, planet, position, was, generally, given, with, respect, to, a, zodiacal, sign, alone, though, less, often, in, specific, degrees, within, a, sign, when, the, degrees, of, longitude, were, given, they, were, expressed, with, reference, to, the, 30, of, the, zodiacal, sign, i, e, not, with, a, reference, to, the, continuous, 360, ecliptic, in, astronomical, ephemerides, the, positions, of, significant, astronomical, phenomena, were, computed, in, sexagesimal, fractions, of, a, degree, equivalent, to, minutes, and, seconds, of, arc, for, daily, ephemerides, the, daily, positions, of, a, planet, were, not, as, important, as, the, astrologically, significant, dates, when, the, planet, crossed, from, one, zodiacal, sign, to, the, next, knowledge, of, the, babylonian, zodiac, is, said, to, be, reflected, in, the, hebrew, bible, e, w, bullinger, interpreted, the, creatures, that, appear, in, the, book, of, ezekiel, 1, 10, as, the, middle, signs, of, the, four, quarters, of, the, zodiac, with, the, lion, as, leo, the, bull, as, taurus, the, man, as, aquarius, and, the, eagle, as, a, higher, aspect, of, scorpio, some, authors, have, linked, the, signs, of, the, zodiac, with, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, and, with, the, lunar, hebrew, calendar, which, has, twelve, lunar, months, in, a, lunar, year, martin, and, others, have, argued, that, the, arrangement, of, the, tribes, around, the, tabernacle, reported, in, the, book, of, numbers, corresponded, to, the, order, of, the, zodiac, with, judah, reuben, ephraim, and, dan, representing, the, middle, signs, of, leo, aquarius, taurus, and, scorpio, respectively, such, connections, were, taken, up, by, thomas, mann, who, in, his, novel, joseph, and, his, brothers, attributes, characteristics, of, a, sign, of, the, zodiac, to, each, tribe, in, his, rendition, of, the, blessing, of, jacob, the, babylonian, star, catalogs, entered, greek, astronomy, in, the, 4th, century, bc, via, eudoxus, of, cnidus, babylonia, or, chaldea, in, the, hellenistic, world, came, to, be, so, identified, with, astrology, that, chaldean, wisdom, became, among, greeks, and, romans, the, synonym, of, divination, through, the, planets, and, stars, hellenistic, astrology, derived, in, part, from, babylonian, and, egyptian, astrology, horoscopic, astrology, first, appeared, in, ptolemaic, egypt, 305, bc, 30, bc, the, dendera, zodiac, a, relief, dating, to, c, 50, bc, is, the, first, known, depiction, of, the, classical, zodiac, of, twelve, signs, the, earliest, extant, greek, text, using, the, babylonian, division, of, the, zodiac, into, 12, signs, of, 30, equal, degrees, each, is, the, anaphoricus, of, hypsicles, of, alexandria, fl, 190, bc, particularly, important, in, the, development, of, western, horoscopic, astrology, was, the, astrologer, and, astronomer, ptolemy, whose, work, tetrabiblos, laid, the, basis, of, the, western, astrological, tradition, under, the, greeks, and, ptolemy, in, particular, the, planets, houses, and, signs, of, the, zodiac, were, rationalized, and, their, function, set, down, in, a, way, that, has, changed, little, to, the, present, day, ptolemy, lived, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, three, centuries, after, the, discovery, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, by, hipparchus, around, 130, bc, hipparchus, lost, work, on, precession, never, circulated, very, widely, until, it, was, brought, to, prominence, by, ptolemy, and, there, are, few, explanations, of, precession, outside, the, work, of, ptolemy, until, late, antiquity, by, which, time, ptolemy, s, influence, was, widely, established, ptolemy, clearly, explained, the, theoretical, basis, of, the, western, zodiac, as, being, a, tropical, coordinate, system, by, which, the, zodiac, is, aligned, to, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, rather, than, the, visible, constellations, that, bear, the, same, names, as, the, zodiac, signs, according, to, mathematician, historian, montucla, the, hindu, zodiac, was, adopted, from, the, greek, zodiac, through, communications, between, ancient, india, and, the, greek, empire, of, bactria, the, hindu, zodiac, uses, the, sidereal, coordinate, system, which, makes, reference, to, the, fixed, stars, the, tropical, zodiac, of, mesopotamian, origin, is, divided, by, the, intersections, of, the, ecliptic, and, equator, which, shifts, in, relation, to, the, backdrop, of, fixed, stars, at, a, rate, of, 1, every, 72, years, creating, the, phenomenon, known, as, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, hindu, zodiac, being, sidereal, does, not, maintain, this, seasonal, alignment, but, there, are, still, similarities, between, the, two, systems, the, hindu, zodiac, signs, and, corresponding, greek, signs, sound, very, different, being, in, sanskrit, and, greek, respectively, but, their, symbols, are, nearly, identical, for, example, dhanu, means, bow, and, corresponds, to, sagittarius, the, archer, and, kumbha, means, water, pitcher, and, corresponds, to, aquarius, the, water, carrier, during, the, abbasid, era, greek, reference, books, were, translated, into, arabic, and, islamic, astronomers, then, did, their, own, observations, correcting, ptolemy, s, almagest, one, such, book, was, al, sufi, s, book, of, fixed, stars, which, has, pictorial, depictions, of, 48, constellations, the, book, was, divided, into, three, sections, constellations, of, the, zodiac, constellations, north, of, the, zodiac, and, southern, constellations, when, al, sufi, s, book, and, other, works, were, translated, in, the, 11th, century, there, were, mistakes, made, in, the, translations, as, a, result, some, stars, ended, up, with, the, names, of, the, constellation, they, belong, to, e, g, hamal, in, aries, the, high, middle, ages, saw, a, revival, of, interest, in, greco, roman, magic, first, in, kabbalism, and, later, continued, in, renaissance, magic, this, included, magical, uses, of, the, zodiac, as, found, e, g, in, the, sefer, raziel, hamalakh, the, zodiac, is, found, in, medieval, stained, glass, as, at, angers, cathedral, where, the, master, glass, maker, andr, robin, made, the, ornate, rosettes, for, the, north, and, south, transepts, after, the, fire, there, in, 1451, astrology, emerged, in, the, 8th, century, ad, as, a, distinct, discipline, in, islam, 64, with, a, mix, of, indian, hellenistic, iranian, and, other, traditions, blended, with, greek, and, islamic, astronomical, knowledge, for, example, ptolemy, s, work, and, al, sufi, s, book, of, fixed, stars, a, knowledge, of, the, influence, that, the, stars, have, on, events, on, the, earth, was, important, in, islamic, civilization, as, a, rule, it, was, believed, that, the, signs, of, the, zodiac, and, the, planets, control, the, destiny, not, only, of, people, but, also, of, nations, and, that, the, zodiac, has, the, ability, to, determine, a, person, s, physical, characteristics, as, well, as, intelligence, and, personal, traits, the, practice, of, astrology, at, this, time, could, be, divided, into, 4, broader, categories, genethlialogy, catarchic, astrology, interrogational, astrology, and, general, astrology, 65, however, the, most, common, type, of, astrology, was, genethlialogy, which, examined, all, aspects, of, a, person, s, life, in, relation, to, the, planetary, positions, at, their, birth, more, commonly, known, as, our, horoscope, 65, astrology, services, were, offered, widely, across, the, empire, mainly, in, bazaars, where, people, could, pay, for, a, reading, astrology, was, valued, in, the, royal, courts, for, example, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, used, astrology, to, determine, the, best, date, for, founding, the, new, capital, of, baghdad, 66, whilst, horoscopes, were, generally, widely, accepted, by, society, many, scholars, condemned, the, use, of, astrology, and, divination, linking, it, to, occult, influences, many, theologians, and, scholars, thought, that, it, went, against, the, tenets, of, islam, as, only, god, should, be, able, to, determine, events, rather, than, astrologers, looking, at, the, positions, of, the, planets, in, order, to, calculate, someone, s, horoscope, an, astrologer, would, use, 3, tools, an, astrolabe, ephemeris, and, a, takht, first, the, astrologer, would, use, an, astrolabe, to, find, the, position, of, the, sun, align, the, rule, with, the, persons, time, of, birth, and, then, align, the, rete, to, establish, the, altitude, of, the, sun, on, that, date, next, the, astrologer, would, use, an, ephemeris, a, table, denoting, the, mean, position, of, the, planets, and, stars, within, the, sky, at, any, given, time, finally, the, astrologer, would, add, the, altitude, of, the, sun, taken, from, the, astrolabe, with, the, mean, position, of, the, planets, on, the, person, s, birthday, and, add, them, together, on, the, takht, also, known, as, the, dustboard, the, dust, board, was, merely, a, tablet, covered, in, sand, on, which, the, calculations, could, be, made, and, erased, easily, once, this, had, been, calculated, the, astrologer, was, then, able, to, interpret, the, horoscope, most, of, these, interpretations, were, based, on, the, zodiac, in, literature, for, example, there, were, several, manuals, on, how, to, interpret, each, zodiac, sign, the, treatise, relating, to, each, individual, sign, and, what, the, characteristics, of, these, zodiacs, were, an, example, of, the, use, of, signs, as, astronomical, coordinates, may, be, found, in, the, nautical, almanac, and, astronomical, ephemeris, for, the, year, 1767, the, longitude, of, the, sun, columns, show, the, sign, represented, as, a, digit, from, 0, to, and, including, 11, degrees, from, 0, to, 29, minutes, and, seconds, mughal, king, jahangir, issued, an, attractive, series, of, coins, in, gold, and, silver, depicting, the, twelve, signs, of, the, zodiac, what, follows, is, a, list, of, the, signs, of, the, modern, zodiac, with, the, ecliptic, longitudes, of, their, first, points, where, 0, aries, is, understood, as, the, vernal, equinox, with, their, latin, greek, sanskrit, and, babylonian, names, but, the, sanskrit, and, the, name, equivalents, after, c, 500, bc, denote, the, constellations, only, not, the, tropical, zodiac, signs, the, english, translation, is, not, usually, used, by, english, speakers, the, latin, names, are, standard, english, usage, except, that, capricorn, is, used, rather, than, capricornus, these, twelve, signs, have, been, arranged, into, a, nursery, rhyme, as, a, mnemonic, device, the, ram, the, bull, the, heavenly, twins, and, next, the, crab, the, lion, shines, the, virgin, and, the, scales, the, scorpion, archer, and, the, goat, the, man, who, holds, the, watering, pot, and, fish, with, glittering, scales, the, following, table, compares, the, gregorian, dates, on, which, the, sun, enters, a, sign, in, the, ptolemaic, tropical, zodiac, and, a, sign, in, the, sidereal, system, proposed, by, cyril, fagan, the, beginning, of, aries, is, defined, as, the, moment, of, vernal, equinox, and, all, other, dates, shift, accordingly, the, precise, gregorian, times, and, dates, vary, slightly, from, year, to, year, as, the, gregorian, calendar, shifts, relative, to, the, tropical, year, these, variations, remain, within, less, than, two, days, difference, in, the, recent, past, and, the, near, future, vernal, equinox, in, ut, always, falling, either, on, 20, or, 21, march, in, the, period, of, 1797, to, 2043, falling, on, 19, march, in, 1796, the, last, time, and, in, 2044, the, next, the, vernal, equinox, has, fallen, on, 20, march, ut, since, 2008, and, will, continue, to, do, so, until, 2043, as, each, sign, takes, up, exactly, 30, degrees, of, the, zodiac, the, average, duration, of, the, solar, stay, in, each, sign, is, one, twelfth, of, a, sidereal, year, or, 30, 43, standard, days, due, to, earth, s, slight, orbital, eccentricity, the, duration, of, each, sign, varies, appreciably, between, about, 29, 4, days, for, capricorn, and, about, 31, 4, days, for, cancer, see, equation, of, time, in, addition, because, the, earth, s, axis, is, at, an, angle, some, signs, take, longer, to, rise, than, others, and, the, farther, away, from, the, equator, the, observer, is, situated, the, greater, the, difference, thus, signs, are, spoken, of, as, long, or, short, ascension, in, tropical, astrology, the, zodiacal, signs, are, distinct, from, the, constellations, associated, with, them, not, only, because, of, their, drifting, apart, due, to, the, precession, of, equinoxes, but, because, the, physical, constellations, take, up, varying, widths, of, the, ecliptic, so, the, sun, is, not, in, each, constellation, for, the, same, amount, of, time, 25, thus, virgo, takes, up, 5, times, as, much, ecliptic, longitude, as, scorpius, the, zodiacal, signs, are, an, abstraction, from, the, physical, constellations, and, each, represent, exactly, 1, 12, th, of, the, full, circle, but, the, time, spent, by, the, sun, in, each, sign, varies, slightly, due, to, the, eccentricity, of, the, earth, s, orbit, sidereal, astrology, remedies, this, by, assigning, the, zodiac, sign, approximately, to, the, corresponding, constellation, this, alignment, needs, re, calibrating, every, so, often, to, keep, the, alignment, in, place, the, ecliptic, intersects, with, 13, constellations, of, ptolemy, s, almagest, as, well, as, of, the, more, precisely, delineated, iau, designated, constellations, in, addition, to, the, twelve, constellations, after, which, the, twelve, zodiac, signs, are, named, the, ecliptic, intersects, ophiuchus, the, bottom, part, of, which, interjects, between, scorpio, and, sagittarius, occasionally, this, difference, between, the, astronomical, constellations, and, the, astrological, signs, is, mistakenly, reported, in, the, popular, press, as, a, change, to, the, list, of, traditional, signs, by, some, astronomical, body, like, the, iau, nasa, or, the, royal, astronomical, society, this, happened, in, a, 1995, report, of, the, bbc, nine, o, clock, news, and, various, reports, in, 2011, and, 2016, some, parazodiacal, constellations, are, touched, by, the, paths, of, the, planets, leading, to, counts, of, up, to, 25, constellations, of, the, zodiac, the, ancient, babylonian, mul, apin, catalog, lists, orion, perseus, auriga, and, andromeda, modern, astronomers, have, noted, that, planets, pass, through, crater, sextans, cetus, pegasus, corvus, hydra, and, scutum, with, venus, very, rarely, passing, through, aquila, canis, minor, auriga, and, serpens, some, other, constellations, are, mythologically, associated, with, the, zodiacal, ones, piscis, austrinus, the, southern, fish, is, attached, to, aquarius, in, classical, maps, it, swallows, the, stream, poured, out, of, aquarius, pitcher, but, perhaps, it, formerly, just, swam, in, it, aquila, the, eagle, was, possibly, associated, with, the, zodiac, by, virtue, of, its, main, star, altair, hydra, in, the, early, bronze, age, marked, the, celestial, equator, and, was, associated, with, leo, which, is, shown, standing, on, the, serpent, on, the, dendera, zodiac, the, zodiac, system, was, developed, in, babylonia, some, 2, 500, years, ago, during, the, age, of, aries, at, the, time, it, is, assumed, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, was, unknown, contemporary, use, of, the, coordinate, system, is, presented, with, the, choice, of, interpreting, the, system, either, as, sidereal, with, the, signs, fixed, to, the, stellar, background, or, as, tropical, with, the, signs, fixed, to, the, point, vector, of, the, sun, at, the, march, equinox, western, astrology, takes, the, tropical, approach, whereas, hindu, astrology, takes, the, sidereal, one, this, results, in, the, originally, unified, zodiacal, coordinate, system, drifting, apart, gradually, with, a, clockwise, westward, precession, of, 1, 4, degrees, per, century, for, the, tropical, zodiac, used, in, western, astronomy, and, astrology, this, means, that, the, tropical, sign, of, aries, currently, lies, somewhere, within, the, constellation, pisces, age, of, pisces, the, sidereal, coordinate, system, takes, into, account, the, ayanamsa, ayan, meaning, transit, or, movement, and, amsa, meaning, small, part, i, e, movement, of, equinoxes, in, small, parts, it, is, unclear, when, indians, became, aware, of, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, but, bh, skara, ii, s, 12th, century, treatise, siddhanta, shiromani, gives, equations, for, measurement, of, precession, of, equinoxes, and, says, his, equations, are, based, on, some, lost, equations, of, suryasiddhanta, plus, the, equation, of, munjaala, the, discovery, of, precession, is, attributed, to, hipparchus, around, 130, bc, ptolemy, quotes, from, hipparchus, now, lost, work, entitled, on, the, displacement, of, the, solstitial, and, equinoctial, points, in, the, seventh, book, of, his, 2nd, century, astronomical, text, almagest, where, he, describes, the, phenomenon, of, precession, and, estimates, its, value, ptolemy, clarified, that, the, convention, of, greek, mathematical, astronomy, was, to, commence, the, zodiac, from, the, point, of, the, vernal, equinox, and, to, always, refer, to, this, point, as, the, first, degree, of, aries, this, is, known, as, the, tropical, zodiac, from, the, greek, word, tr, pos, turn, because, its, starting, point, revolves, through, the, circle, of, background, constellations, over, time, the, principle, of, the, vernal, point, acting, as, the, first, degree, of, the, zodiac, for, greek, astronomers, is, described, in, the, 1st, century, bc, astronomical, text, of, geminus, of, rhodes, geminus, explains, that, greek, astronomers, of, his, era, associate, the, first, degrees, of, the, zodiac, signs, with, the, two, solstices, and, the, two, equinoxes, in, contrast, to, the, older, chaldean, babylonian, system, which, placed, these, points, within, the, zodiac, signs, this, illustrates, that, ptolemy, merely, clarified, the, convention, of, greek, astronomers, and, did, not, originate, the, principle, of, the, tropical, zodiac, as, is, sometimes, assumed, ptolemy, demonstrates, that, the, principle, of, the, tropical, zodiac, was, well, known, to, his, predecessors, within, his, astrological, text, the, tetrabiblos, where, he, explains, why, it, would, be, an, error, to, associate, the, regularly, spaced, signs, of, the, seasonally, aligned, zodiac, with, the, irregular, boundaries, of, the, visible, constellations, the, beginnings, of, the, signs, and, likewise, those, of, the, terms, are, to, be, taken, from, the, equinoctial, and, tropical, points, this, rule, is, not, only, clearly, stated, by, writers, on, the, subject, but, is, especially, evident, by, the, demonstration, constantly, afforded, that, their, natures, influences, and, familiarities, have, no, other, origin, than, from, the, tropics, and, equinoxes, as, has, been, already, plainly, shown, and, if, other, beginnings, were, allowed, it, would, either, be, necessary, to, exclude, the, natures, of, the, signs, from, the, theory, of, prognostication, or, impossible, to, avoid, error, in, then, retaining, and, making, use, of, them, as, the, regularity, of, their, spaces, and, distances, upon, which, their, influence, depends, would, then, be, invaded, and, broken, in, upon, astronomically, the, zodiac, defines, a, belt, of, space, extending, 8, or, 9, in, celestial, latitude, to, the, north, and, south, of, the, ecliptic, within, which, the, orbits, of, the, moon, and, the, principal, planets, remain, it, is, a, feature, of, the, ecliptic, coordinate, system, a, celestial, coordinate, system, centered, upon, the, ecliptic, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, orbit, and, the, sun, s, apparent, path, by, which, celestial, longitude, is, measured, in, degrees, east, of, the, vernal, equinox, the, ascending, intersection, of, the, ecliptic, and, equator, the, zodiac, is, narrow, in, angular, terms, because, most, of, the, sun, s, planets, have, orbits, that, have, only, a, slight, inclination, to, the, orbital, plane, of, the, earth, stars, within, the, zodiac, are, subject, to, occultations, by, the, moon, and, other, solar, system, bodies, these, events, can, be, useful, for, example, to, estimate, the, cross, sectional, dimensions, of, a, minor, planet, or, check, a, star, for, a, close, companion, the, sun, s, placement, upon, the, vernal, equinox, which, occurs, annually, around, 21, march, defines, the, starting, point, for, measurement, the, first, degree, of, which, is, historically, known, as, the, first, point, of, aries, the, first, 30, along, the, ecliptic, is, nominally, designated, as, the, zodiac, sign, aries, which, no, longer, falls, within, the, proximity, of, the, constellation, aries, since, the, effect, of, precession, is, to, move, the, vernal, point, through, the, backdrop, of, visible, constellations, it, is, currently, located, near, the, end, of, the, constellation, pisces, having, been, within, that, constellation, since, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, subsequent, 30, of, the, ecliptic, is, nominally, designated, the, zodiac, sign, taurus, and, so, on, through, the, twelve, signs, of, the, zodiac, so, that, each, occupies, 1, 12, th, 30, of, the, zodiac, s, great, circle, zodiac, signs, have, never, been, used, to, determine, the, boundaries, of, astronomical, constellations, that, lie, in, the, vicinity, of, the, zodiac, which, are, and, always, have, been, irregular, in, their, size, and, shape, the, convention, of, measuring, celestial, longitude, within, individual, signs, was, still, being, used, in, the, mid, 19th, century, but, modern, astronomy, now, numbers, degrees, of, celestial, longitude, continuously, from, 0, to, 360, rather, than, 0, to, 30, within, each, sign, this, coordinate, system, is, primary, used, by, astronomers, for, observations, of, solar, system, objects, the, use, of, the, zodiac, as, a, means, to, determine, astronomical, measurement, remained, the, main, method, for, defining, celestial, positions, by, western, astronomers, until, the, renaissance, at, which, time, preference, moved, to, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, which, measures, astronomical, positions, by, right, ascension, and, declination, rather, than, the, ecliptic, based, definitions, of, celestial, longitude, and, celestial, latitude, the, orientation, of, equatorial, coordinates, are, aligned, with, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, rather, than, the, plane, of, the, planet, s, orbit, around, the, sun, the, word, zodiac, is, used, in, reference, to, the, zodiacal, cloud, of, dust, grains, that, move, among, the, planets, and, the, zodiacal, light, that, originates, from, their, scattering, of, sunlight, while, its, name, is, derived, from, the, zodiac, the, zodiacal, light, covers, the, entire, night, sky, with, enhancements, in, certain, directions, in, unicode, the, symbols, of, zodiac, signs, are, encoded, in, block, miscellaneous, symbols, they, can, be, forced, to, look, like, text, by, appending, u, fe0e, or, like, emojis, by, appending, u, fe0f
