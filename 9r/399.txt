xenon, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, xe, and, atomic, number, 54, it, is, a, dense, colorless, odorless, noble, gas, found, in, earth, s, atmosphere, in, trace, amounts, although, generally, unreactive, it, can, undergo, a, few, chemical, reactions, such, as, the, formation, of, xenon, hexafluoroplatinate, the, first, noble, gas, compound, to, be, synthesized, xenon, is, used, in, flash, lamps, and, arc, lamps, and, as, a, general, anesthetic, the, first, excimer, laser, design, used, a, xenon, dimer, molecule, xe, 2, as, the, lasing, medium, and, the, earliest, laser, designs, used, xenon, flash, lamps, as, pumps, xenon, is, also, used, to, search, for, hypothetical, weakly, interacting, massive, particles, and, as, a, propellant, for, ion, thrusters, in, spacecraft, naturally, occurring, xenon, consists, of, seven, stable, isotopes, and, two, long, lived, radioactive, isotopes, more, than, 40, unstable, xenon, isotopes, undergo, radioactive, decay, and, the, isotope, ratios, of, xenon, are, an, important, tool, for, studying, the, early, history, of, the, solar, system, radioactive, xenon, 135, is, produced, by, beta, decay, from, iodine, 135, a, product, of, nuclear, fission, and, is, the, most, significant, and, unwanted, neutron, absorber, in, nuclear, reactors, xenon, was, discovered, in, england, by, the, scottish, chemist, william, ramsay, and, english, chemist, morris, travers, on, july, 12, 1898, shortly, after, their, discovery, of, the, elements, krypton, and, neon, they, found, xenon, in, the, residue, left, over, from, evaporating, components, of, liquid, air, ramsay, suggested, the, name, xenon, for, this, gas, from, the, greek, word, x, non, neuter, singular, form, of, x, nos, meaning, foreign, er, strange, r, or, guest, in, 1902, ramsay, estimated, the, proportion, of, xenon, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, to, be, one, part, in, 20, million, during, the, 1930s, american, engineer, harold, edgerton, began, exploring, strobe, light, technology, for, high, speed, photography, this, led, him, to, the, invention, of, the, xenon, flash, lamp, in, which, light, is, generated, by, passing, brief, electric, current, through, a, tube, filled, with, xenon, gas, in, 1934, edgerton, was, able, to, generate, flashes, as, brief, as, one, microsecond, with, this, method, in, 1939, american, physician, albert, r, behnke, jr, began, exploring, the, causes, of, drunkenness, in, deep, sea, divers, he, tested, the, effects, of, varying, the, breathing, mixtures, on, his, subjects, and, discovered, that, this, caused, the, divers, to, perceive, a, change, in, depth, from, his, results, he, deduced, that, xenon, gas, could, serve, as, an, anesthetic, although, russian, toxicologist, nikolay, v, lazarev, apparently, studied, xenon, anesthesia, in, 1941, the, first, published, report, confirming, xenon, anesthesia, was, in, 1946, by, american, medical, researcher, john, h, lawrence, who, experimented, on, mice, xenon, was, first, used, as, a, surgical, anesthetic, in, 1951, by, american, anesthesiologist, stuart, c, cullen, who, successfully, used, it, with, two, patients, xenon, and, the, other, noble, gases, were, for, a, long, time, considered, to, be, completely, chemically, inert, and, not, able, to, form, compounds, however, while, teaching, at, the, university, of, british, columbia, neil, bartlett, discovered, that, the, gas, platinum, hexafluoride, ptf, 6, was, a, powerful, oxidizing, agent, that, could, oxidize, oxygen, gas, o, 2, to, form, dioxygenyl, hexafluoroplatinate, o, 2, since, o, 2, 1165, kj, mol, and, xenon, 1170, kj, mol, have, almost, the, same, first, ionization, potential, bartlett, realized, that, platinum, hexafluoride, might, also, be, able, to, oxidize, xenon, on, march, 23, 1962, he, mixed, the, two, gases, and, produced, the, first, known, compound, of, a, noble, gas, xenon, hexafluoroplatinate, bartlett, thought, its, composition, to, be, xe, but, later, work, revealed, that, it, was, probably, a, mixture, of, various, xenon, containing, salts, since, then, many, other, xenon, compounds, have, been, discovered, in, addition, to, some, compounds, of, the, noble, gases, argon, krypton, and, radon, including, argon, fluorohydride, harf, krypton, difluoride, krf, 2, and, radon, fluoride, by, 1971, more, than, 80, xenon, compounds, were, known, in, november, 1989, ibm, scientists, demonstrated, a, technology, capable, of, manipulating, individual, atoms, the, program, called, ibm, in, atoms, used, a, scanning, tunneling, microscope, to, arrange, 35, individual, xenon, atoms, on, a, substrate, of, chilled, crystal, of, nickel, to, spell, out, the, three, letter, company, initialism, it, was, the, first, time, atoms, had, been, precisely, positioned, on, a, flat, surface, xenon, has, atomic, number, 54, that, is, its, nucleus, contains, 54, protons, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, pure, xenon, gas, has, a, density, of, 5, 894, kg, m, 3, about, 4, 5, times, the, density, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, at, sea, level, 1, 217, kg, m, 3, as, a, liquid, xenon, has, a, density, of, up, to, 3, 100, g, ml, with, the, density, maximum, occurring, at, the, triple, point, liquid, xenon, has, a, high, polarizability, due, to, its, large, atomic, volume, and, thus, is, an, excellent, solvent, it, can, dissolve, hydrocarbons, biological, molecules, and, even, water, under, the, same, conditions, the, density, of, solid, xenon, 3, 640, g, cm, 3, is, greater, than, the, average, density, of, granite, 2, 75, g, cm, 3, under, gigapascals, of, pressure, xenon, forms, a, metallic, phase, solid, xenon, changes, from, face, centered, cubic, fcc, to, hexagonal, close, packed, hcp, crystal, phase, under, pressure, and, begins, to, turn, metallic, at, about, 140, gpa, with, no, noticeable, volume, change, in, the, hcp, phase, it, is, completely, metallic, at, 155, gpa, when, metallized, xenon, appears, sky, blue, because, it, absorbs, red, light, and, transmits, other, visible, frequencies, such, behavior, is, unusual, for, a, metal, and, is, explained, by, the, relatively, small, width, of, the, electron, bands, in, that, state, liquid, or, solid, xenon, nanoparticles, can, be, formed, at, room, temperature, by, implanting, xe, ions, into, a, solid, matrix, many, solids, have, lattice, constants, smaller, than, solid, xe, this, results, in, compression, of, the, implanted, xe, to, pressures, that, may, be, sufficient, for, its, liquefaction, or, solidification, xenon, is, a, member, of, the, zero, valence, elements, that, are, called, noble, or, inert, gases, it, is, inert, to, most, common, chemical, reactions, such, as, combustion, for, example, because, the, outer, valence, shell, contains, eight, electrons, this, produces, a, stable, minimum, energy, configuration, in, which, the, outer, electrons, are, tightly, bound, in, a, gas, filled, tube, xenon, emits, a, blue, or, lavenderish, glow, when, excited, by, electrical, discharge, xenon, emits, a, band, of, emission, lines, that, span, the, visual, spectrum, but, the, most, intense, lines, occur, in, the, region, of, blue, light, producing, the, coloration, xenon, is, a, trace, gas, in, earth, s, atmosphere, occurring, at, a, volume, fraction, of, 87, 1, nl, l, parts, per, billion, or, approximately, 1, part, per, 11, 5, million, it, is, also, found, as, a, component, of, gases, emitted, from, some, mineral, springs, given, a, total, mass, of, the, atmosphere, of, 5, 15, 10, 18, kilograms, 1, 135, 10, 19, lb, the, atmosphere, contains, on, the, order, of, 2, 03, gigatonnes, 2, 00, 10, 9, long, tons, 2, 24, 10, 9, short, tons, of, xenon, in, total, when, taking, the, average, molar, mass, of, the, atmosphere, as, 28, 96, g, mol, which, is, equivalent, to, some, 394, mass, ppb, xenon, is, obtained, commercially, as, a, by, product, of, the, separation, of, air, into, oxygen, and, nitrogen, after, this, separation, generally, performed, by, fractional, distillation, in, a, double, column, plant, the, liquid, oxygen, produced, will, contain, small, quantities, of, krypton, and, xenon, by, additional, fractional, distillation, the, liquid, oxygen, may, be, enriched, to, contain, 0, 1, 0, 2, of, a, krypton, xenon, mixture, which, is, extracted, either, by, adsorption, onto, silica, gel, or, by, distillation, finally, the, krypton, xenon, mixture, may, be, separated, into, krypton, and, xenon, by, further, distillation, worldwide, production, of, xenon, in, 1998, was, estimated, at, 5, 000, 7, 000, cubic, metres, 180, 000, 250, 000, cu, ft, at, a, density, of, 5, 894, grams, per, litre, 0, 0002129, lb, cu, in, this, is, equivalent, to, roughly, 30, to, 40, tonnes, 30, to, 39, long, tons, 33, to, 44, short, tons, because, of, its, scarcity, xenon, is, much, more, expensive, than, the, lighter, noble, gases, approximate, prices, for, the, purchase, of, small, quantities, in, europe, in, 1999, were, 10, l, 1, 7, g, for, xenon, 1, l, 0, 27, g, for, krypton, and, 0, 20, l, 0, 22, g, for, neon, while, the, much, more, plentiful, argon, which, makes, up, over, 1, by, volume, of, earth, s, atmosphere, costs, less, than, a, cent, per, liter, within, the, solar, system, the, nucleon, fraction, of, xenon, is, 1, 56, 10, 8, for, an, abundance, of, approximately, one, part, in, 630, thousand, of, the, total, mass, xenon, is, relatively, rare, in, the, sun, s, atmosphere, on, earth, and, in, asteroids, and, comets, the, abundance, of, xenon, in, the, atmosphere, of, planet, jupiter, is, unusually, high, about, 2, 6, times, that, of, the, sun, this, abundance, remains, unexplained, but, may, have, been, caused, by, an, early, and, rapid, buildup, of, planetesimals, small, sub, planetary, bodies, before, the, heating, of, the, presolar, disk, otherwise, xenon, would, not, have, been, trapped, in, the, planetesimal, ices, the, problem, of, the, low, terrestrial, xenon, may, be, explained, by, covalent, bonding, of, xenon, to, oxygen, within, quartz, reducing, the, outgassing, of, xenon, into, the, atmosphere, unlike, the, lower, mass, noble, gases, the, normal, stellar, nucleosynthesis, process, inside, a, star, does, not, form, xenon, nucleosynthesis, consumes, energy, to, produce, nuclides, more, massive, than, iron, 56, and, thus, the, synthesis, of, xenon, represents, no, energy, gain, for, a, star, instead, xenon, is, formed, during, supernova, explosions, during, the, r, process, by, the, slow, neutron, capture, process, s, process, in, red, giant, stars, that, have, exhausted, their, core, hydrogen, and, entered, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, and, from, radioactive, decay, for, example, by, beta, decay, of, extinct, iodine, 129, and, spontaneous, fission, of, thorium, uranium, and, plutonium, xenon, 135, is, a, notable, neutron, poison, with, a, high, fission, product, yield, as, it, is, relatively, short, lived, it, decays, at, the, same, rate, it, is, produced, during, steady, operation, of, a, nuclear, reactor, however, if, power, is, reduced, or, the, reactor, is, scrammed, less, xenon, is, destroyed, than, is, produced, from, the, beta, decay, of, its, parent, nuclides, this, phenomenon, called, xenon, poisoning, can, cause, significant, problems, in, restarting, a, reactor, after, a, scram, or, increasing, power, after, it, had, been, reduced, and, it, was, one, of, several, contributing, factors, in, the, chernobyl, nuclear, accident, stable, or, extremely, long, lived, isotopes, of, xenon, are, also, produced, in, appreciable, quantities, in, nuclear, fission, xenon, 136, is, produced, when, xenon, 135, undergoes, neutron, capture, before, it, can, decay, the, ratio, of, xenon, 136, to, xenon, 135, or, its, decay, products, can, give, hints, as, to, the, power, history, of, a, given, reactor, and, the, absence, of, xenon, 136, is, a, fingerprint, for, nuclear, explosions, as, xenon, 135, is, not, produced, directly, but, as, a, product, of, successive, beta, decays, and, thus, it, cannot, absorb, any, neutrons, in, a, nuclear, explosion, which, occurs, in, fractions, of, a, second, the, stable, isotope, xenon, 132, has, a, fission, product, yield, of, over, 4, in, the, thermal, neutron, fission, of, 235, u, which, means, that, stable, or, nearly, stable, xenon, isotopes, have, a, higher, mass, fraction, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, which, is, about, 3, fission, products, than, it, does, in, air, however, there, is, as, of, 2022, no, commercial, effort, to, extract, xenon, from, spent, fuel, during, nuclear, reprocessing, naturally, occurring, xenon, is, composed, of, seven, stable, isotopes, 126, xe, 128, 132, xe, and, 134, xe, the, isotopes, 126, xe, and, 134, xe, are, predicted, by, theory, to, undergo, double, beta, decay, but, this, has, never, been, observed, so, they, are, considered, stable, in, addition, more, than, 40, unstable, isotopes, have, been, studied, the, longest, lived, of, these, isotopes, are, the, primordial, 124, xe, which, undergoes, double, electron, capture, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 8, 10, 22, yr, and, 136, xe, which, undergoes, double, beta, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 11, 10, 21, yr, 129, xe, is, produced, by, beta, decay, of, 129, i, which, has, a, half, life, of, 16, million, years, 131m, xe, 133, xe, 133m, xe, and, 135, xe, are, some, of, the, fission, products, of, 235, u, and, 239, pu, and, are, used, to, detect, and, monitor, nuclear, explosions, nuclei, of, two, of, the, stable, isotopes, of, xenon, 129, xe, and, 131, xe, both, stable, isotopes, with, odd, mass, numbers, have, non, zero, intrinsic, angular, momenta, nuclear, spins, suitable, for, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, the, nuclear, spins, can, be, aligned, beyond, ordinary, polarization, levels, by, means, of, circularly, polarized, light, and, rubidium, vapor, the, resulting, spin, polarization, of, xenon, nuclei, can, surpass, 50, of, its, maximum, possible, value, greatly, exceeding, the, thermal, equilibrium, value, dictated, by, paramagnetic, statistics, typically, 0, 001, of, the, maximum, value, at, room, temperature, even, in, the, strongest, magnets, such, non, equilibrium, alignment, of, spins, is, a, temporary, condition, and, is, called, hyperpolarization, the, process, of, hyperpolarizing, the, xenon, is, called, optical, pumping, although, the, process, is, different, from, pumping, a, laser, because, a, 129, xe, nucleus, has, a, spin, of, 1, 2, and, therefore, a, zero, electric, quadrupole, moment, the, 129, xe, nucleus, does, not, experience, any, quadrupolar, interactions, during, collisions, with, other, atoms, and, the, hyperpolarization, persists, for, long, periods, even, after, the, engendering, light, and, vapor, have, been, removed, spin, polarization, of, 129, xe, can, persist, from, several, seconds, for, xenon, atoms, dissolved, in, blood, to, several, hours, in, the, gas, phase, and, several, days, in, deeply, frozen, solid, xenon, in, contrast, 131, xe, has, a, nuclear, spin, value, of, 3, 2, and, a, nonzero, quadrupole, moment, and, has, t, 1, relaxation, times, in, the, millisecond, and, second, ranges, some, radioactive, isotopes, of, xenon, for, example, 133, xe, and, 135, xe, are, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, of, fissionable, material, within, nuclear, reactors, 135, xe, is, of, considerable, significance, in, the, operation, of, nuclear, fission, reactors, 135, xe, has, a, huge, cross, section, for, thermal, neutrons, 2, 6, 10, 6, barns, and, operates, as, a, neutron, absorber, or, poison, that, can, slow, or, stop, the, chain, reaction, after, a, period, of, operation, this, was, discovered, in, the, earliest, nuclear, reactors, built, by, the, american, manhattan, project, for, plutonium, production, however, the, designers, had, made, provisions, in, the, design, to, increase, the, reactor, s, reactivity, the, number, of, neutrons, per, fission, that, go, on, to, fission, other, atoms, of, nuclear, fuel, 135, xe, reactor, poisoning, was, a, major, factor, in, the, chernobyl, disaster, a, shutdown, or, decrease, of, power, of, a, reactor, can, result, in, buildup, of, 135, xe, with, reactor, operation, going, into, a, condition, known, as, the, iodine, pit, under, adverse, conditions, relatively, high, concentrations, of, radioactive, xenon, isotopes, may, emanate, from, cracked, fuel, rods, or, fissioning, of, uranium, in, cooling, water, isotope, ratios, of, xenon, produced, in, natural, nuclear, fission, reactors, at, oklo, in, gabon, reveal, the, reactor, properties, during, chain, reaction, that, took, place, about, 2, billion, years, ago, because, xenon, is, a, tracer, for, two, parent, isotopes, xenon, isotope, ratios, in, meteorites, are, a, powerful, tool, for, studying, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, the, iodine, xenon, method, of, dating, gives, the, time, elapsed, between, nucleosynthesis, and, the, condensation, of, a, solid, object, from, the, solar, nebula, in, 1960, physicist, john, h, reynolds, discovered, that, certain, meteorites, contained, an, isotopic, anomaly, in, the, form, of, an, overabundance, of, xenon, 129, he, inferred, that, this, was, a, decay, product, of, radioactive, iodine, 129, this, isotope, is, produced, slowly, by, cosmic, ray, spallation, and, nuclear, fission, but, is, produced, in, quantity, only, in, supernova, explosions, because, the, half, life, of, 129, i, is, comparatively, short, on, a, cosmological, time, scale, 16, million, years, this, demonstrated, that, only, a, short, time, had, passed, between, the, supernova, and, the, time, the, meteorites, had, solidified, and, trapped, the, 129, i, these, two, events, supernova, and, solidification, of, gas, cloud, were, inferred, to, have, happened, during, the, early, history, of, the, solar, system, because, the, 129, i, isotope, was, likely, generated, shortly, before, the, solar, system, was, formed, seeding, the, solar, gas, cloud, with, isotopes, from, a, second, source, this, supernova, source, may, also, have, caused, collapse, of, the, solar, gas, cloud, in, a, similar, way, xenon, isotopic, ratios, such, as, 129, xe, 130, xe, and, 136, xe, 130, xe, are, a, powerful, tool, for, understanding, planetary, differentiation, and, early, outgassing, for, example, the, atmosphere, of, mars, shows, a, xenon, abundance, similar, to, that, of, earth, 0, 08, parts, per, million, but, mars, shows, a, greater, abundance, of, 129, xe, than, the, earth, or, the, sun, since, this, isotope, is, generated, by, radioactive, decay, the, result, may, indicate, that, mars, lost, most, of, its, primordial, atmosphere, possibly, within, the, first, 100, million, years, after, the, planet, was, formed, in, another, example, excess, 129, xe, found, in, carbon, dioxide, well, gases, from, new, mexico, is, believed, to, be, from, the, decay, of, mantle, derived, gases, from, soon, after, earth, s, formation, after, neil, bartlett, s, discovery, in, 1962, that, xenon, can, form, chemical, compounds, a, large, number, of, xenon, compounds, have, been, discovered, and, described, almost, all, known, xenon, compounds, contain, the, electronegative, atoms, fluorine, or, oxygen, the, chemistry, of, xenon, in, each, oxidation, state, is, analogous, to, that, of, the, neighboring, element, iodine, in, the, immediately, lower, oxidation, state, three, fluorides, are, known, xef, 2, xef, 4, and, xef, 6, xef, is, theorized, to, be, unstable, these, are, the, starting, points, for, the, synthesis, of, almost, all, xenon, compounds, the, solid, crystalline, difluoride, xef, 2, is, formed, when, a, mixture, of, fluorine, and, xenon, gases, is, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, the, ultraviolet, component, of, ordinary, daylight, is, sufficient, long, term, heating, of, xef, 2, at, high, temperatures, under, an, nif, 2, catalyst, yields, xef, 6, pyrolysis, of, xef, 6, in, the, presence, of, naf, yields, high, purity, xef, 4, the, xenon, fluorides, behave, as, both, fluoride, acceptors, and, fluoride, donors, forming, salts, that, contain, such, cations, as, xef, and, xe, 2, f, 3, and, anions, such, as, xef, 5, xef, 7, and, xef, 2, 8, the, green, paramagnetic, xe, 2, is, formed, by, the, reduction, of, xef, 2, by, xenon, gas, xef, 2, also, forms, coordination, complexes, with, transition, metal, ions, more, than, 30, such, complexes, have, been, synthesized, and, characterized, whereas, the, xenon, fluorides, are, well, characterized, the, other, halides, are, not, xenon, dichloride, formed, by, the, high, frequency, irradiation, of, a, mixture, of, xenon, fluorine, and, silicon, or, carbon, tetrachloride, is, reported, to, be, an, endothermic, colorless, crystalline, compound, that, decomposes, into, the, elements, at, 80, c, however, xecl, 2, may, be, merely, a, van, der, waals, molecule, of, weakly, bound, xe, atoms, and, cl, 2, molecules, and, not, a, real, compound, theoretical, calculations, indicate, that, the, linear, molecule, xecl, 2, is, less, stable, than, the, van, der, waals, complex, xenon, tetrachloride, and, xenon, dibromide, are, even, more, unstable, and, they, cannot, be, synthesized, by, chemical, reactions, they, were, created, by, radioactive, decay, of, 129, icl, 4, and, 129, ibr, 2, respectively, three, oxides, of, xenon, are, known, xenon, trioxide, xeo, 3, and, xenon, tetroxide, xeo, 4, both, of, which, are, dangerously, explosive, and, powerful, oxidizing, agents, and, xenon, dioxide, xeo, 2, which, was, reported, in, 2011, with, a, coordination, number, of, four, xeo, 2, forms, when, xenon, tetrafluoride, is, poured, over, ice, its, crystal, structure, may, allow, it, to, replace, silicon, in, silicate, minerals, the, xeoo, cation, has, been, identified, by, infrared, spectroscopy, in, solid, argon, xenon, does, not, react, with, oxygen, directly, the, trioxide, is, formed, by, the, hydrolysis, of, xef, 6, xeo, 3, is, weakly, acidic, dissolving, in, alkali, to, form, unstable, xenate, salts, containing, the, hxeo, 4, anion, these, unstable, salts, easily, disproportionate, into, xenon, gas, and, perxenate, salts, containing, the, xeo, 4, 6, anion, barium, perxenate, when, treated, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, yields, gaseous, xenon, tetroxide, to, prevent, decomposition, the, xenon, tetroxide, thus, formed, is, quickly, cooled, into, a, pale, yellow, solid, it, explodes, above, 35, 9, c, into, xenon, and, oxygen, gas, but, is, otherwise, stable, a, number, of, xenon, oxyfluorides, are, known, including, xeof, 2, xeof, 4, xeo, 2, f, 2, and, xeo, 3, f, 2, xeof, 2, is, formed, by, reacting, of, 2, with, xenon, gas, at, low, temperatures, it, may, also, be, obtained, by, partial, hydrolysis, of, xef, 4, it, disproportionates, at, 20, c, into, xef, 2, and, xeo, 2, f, 2, xeof, 4, is, formed, by, the, partial, hydrolysis, of, xef, 6, or, the, reaction, of, xef, 6, with, sodium, perxenate, na, 4, xeo, 6, the, latter, reaction, also, produces, a, small, amount, of, xeo, 3, f, 2, xeo, 2, f, 2, is, also, formed, by, partial, hydrolysis, of, xef, 6, xeof, 4, reacts, with, csf, to, form, the, xeof, 5, anion, while, xeof, 3, reacts, with, the, alkali, metal, fluorides, kf, rbf, and, csf, to, form, the, xeof, 4, anion, xenon, can, be, directly, bonded, to, a, less, electronegative, element, than, fluorine, or, oxygen, particularly, carbon, electron, withdrawing, groups, such, as, groups, with, fluorine, substitution, are, necessary, to, stabilize, these, compounds, numerous, such, compounds, have, been, characterized, including, other, compounds, containing, xenon, bonded, to, a, less, electronegative, element, include, f, xe, n, so, 2, f, 2, and, f, xe, bf, 2, the, latter, is, synthesized, from, dioxygenyl, tetrafluoroborate, o, 2, bf, 4, at, 100, c, an, unusual, ion, containing, xenon, is, the, tetraxenonogold, ii, cation, auxe, 2, 4, which, contains, xe, au, bonds, this, ion, occurs, in, the, compound, auxe, 4, sb, 2, f, 11, 2, and, is, remarkable, in, having, direct, chemical, bonds, between, two, notoriously, unreactive, atoms, xenon, and, gold, with, xenon, acting, as, a, transition, metal, ligand, a, similar, mercury, complex, hgxe, sb, 3, f, 17, formulated, as, is, also, known, the, compound, xe, 2, sb, 2, f, 11, contains, a, xe, xe, bond, the, longest, element, element, bond, known, 308, 71, pm, 3, 0871, in, 1995, m, r, s, nen, and, co, workers, scientists, at, the, university, of, helsinki, in, finland, announced, the, preparation, of, xenon, dihydride, hxeh, and, later, xenon, hydride, hydroxide, hxeoh, hydroxenoacetylene, hxecch, and, other, xe, containing, molecules, in, 2008, khriachtchev, et, al, reported, the, preparation, of, hxeoxeh, by, the, photolysis, of, water, within, a, cryogenic, xenon, matrix, deuterated, molecules, hxeod, and, dxeoh, have, also, been, produced, in, addition, to, compounds, where, xenon, forms, a, chemical, bond, xenon, can, form, clathrates, substances, where, xenon, atoms, or, pairs, are, trapped, by, the, crystalline, lattice, of, another, compound, one, example, is, xenon, hydrate, xe, 5, 3, 4, h, 2, o, where, xenon, atoms, occupy, vacancies, in, a, lattice, of, water, molecules, this, clathrate, has, a, melting, point, of, 24, c, the, deuterated, version, of, this, hydrate, has, also, been, produced, another, example, is, xenon, hydride, xe, h, 2, 8, in, which, xenon, pairs, dimers, are, trapped, inside, solid, hydrogen, such, clathrate, hydrates, can, occur, naturally, under, conditions, of, high, pressure, such, as, in, lake, vostok, underneath, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, clathrate, formation, can, be, used, to, fractionally, distill, xenon, argon, and, krypton, xenon, can, also, form, endohedral, fullerene, compounds, where, a, xenon, atom, is, trapped, inside, a, fullerene, molecule, the, xenon, atom, trapped, in, the, fullerene, can, be, observed, by, 129, xe, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, spectroscopy, through, the, sensitive, chemical, shift, of, the, xenon, atom, to, its, environment, chemical, reactions, on, the, fullerene, molecule, can, be, analyzed, these, observations, are, not, without, caveat, however, because, the, xenon, atom, has, an, electronic, influence, on, the, reactivity, of, the, fullerene, when, xenon, atoms, are, in, the, ground, energy, state, they, repel, each, other, and, will, not, form, a, bond, when, xenon, atoms, becomes, energized, however, they, can, form, an, excimer, excited, dimer, until, the, electrons, return, to, the, ground, state, this, entity, is, formed, because, the, xenon, atom, tends, to, complete, the, outermost, electronic, shell, by, adding, an, electron, from, a, neighboring, xenon, atom, the, typical, lifetime, of, a, xenon, excimer, is, 1, 5, nanoseconds, and, the, decay, releases, photons, with, wavelengths, of, about, 150, and, 173, nm, xenon, can, also, form, excimers, with, other, elements, such, as, the, halogens, bromine, chlorine, and, fluorine, although, xenon, is, rare, and, relatively, expensive, to, extract, from, the, earth, s, atmosphere, it, has, a, number, of, applications, xenon, is, used, in, light, emitting, devices, called, xenon, flash, lamps, used, in, photographic, flashes, and, stroboscopic, lamps, to, excite, the, active, medium, in, lasers, which, then, generate, coherent, light, and, occasionally, in, bactericidal, lamps, the, first, solid, state, laser, invented, in, 1960, was, pumped, by, a, xenon, flash, lamp, and, lasers, used, to, power, inertial, confinement, fusion, are, also, pumped, by, xenon, flash, lamps, continuous, short, arc, high, pressure, xenon, arc, lamps, have, a, color, temperature, closely, approximating, noon, sunlight, and, are, used, in, solar, simulators, that, is, the, chromaticity, of, these, lamps, closely, approximates, a, heated, black, body, radiator, at, the, temperature, of, the, sun, first, introduced, in, the, 1940s, these, lamps, replaced, the, shorter, lived, carbon, arc, lamps, in, movie, projectors, they, are, also, employed, in, typical, 35mm, imax, and, digital, film, projection, systems, they, are, an, excellent, source, of, short, wavelength, ultraviolet, radiation, and, have, intense, emissions, in, the, near, infrared, used, in, some, night, vision, systems, xenon, is, used, as, a, starter, gas, in, metal, halide, lamps, for, automotive, hid, headlights, and, high, end, tactical, flashlights, the, individual, cells, in, a, plasma, display, contain, a, mixture, of, xenon, and, neon, ionized, with, electrodes, the, interaction, of, this, plasma, with, the, electrodes, generates, ultraviolet, photons, which, then, excite, the, phosphor, coating, on, the, front, of, the, display, xenon, is, used, as, a, starter, gas, in, high, pressure, sodium, lamps, it, has, the, lowest, thermal, conductivity, and, lowest, ionization, potential, of, all, the, non, radioactive, noble, gases, as, a, noble, gas, it, does, not, interfere, with, the, chemical, reactions, occurring, in, the, operating, lamp, the, low, thermal, conductivity, minimizes, thermal, losses, in, the, lamp, while, in, the, operating, state, and, the, low, ionization, potential, causes, the, breakdown, voltage, of, the, gas, to, be, relatively, low, in, the, cold, state, which, allows, the, lamp, to, be, more, easily, started, in, 1962, a, group, of, researchers, at, bell, laboratories, discovered, laser, action, in, xenon, and, later, found, that, the, laser, gain, was, improved, by, adding, helium, to, the, lasing, medium, the, first, excimer, laser, used, a, xenon, dimer, xe, 2, energized, by, a, beam, of, electrons, to, produce, stimulated, emission, at, an, ultraviolet, wavelength, of, 176, nm, xenon, chloride, and, xenon, fluoride, have, also, been, used, in, excimer, or, more, accurately, exciplex, lasers, xenon, has, been, used, as, a, general, anesthetic, but, it, is, more, expensive, than, conventional, anesthetics, xenon, interacts, with, many, different, receptors, and, ion, channels, and, like, many, theoretically, multi, modal, inhalation, anesthetics, these, interactions, are, likely, complementary, xenon, is, a, high, affinity, glycine, site, nmda, receptor, antagonist, however, xenon, is, different, from, certain, other, nmda, receptor, antagonists, in, that, it, is, not, neurotoxic, and, it, inhibits, the, neurotoxicity, of, ketamine, and, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, while, actually, producing, neuroprotective, effects, unlike, ketamine, and, nitrous, oxide, xenon, does, not, stimulate, a, dopamine, efflux, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, like, nitrous, oxide, and, cyclopropane, xenon, activates, the, two, pore, domain, potassium, channel, trek, 1, a, related, channel, task, 3, also, implicated, in, the, actions, of, inhalation, anesthetics, is, insensitive, to, xenon, xenon, inhibits, nicotinic, acetylcholine, 4, 2, receptors, which, contribute, to, spinally, mediated, analgesia, xenon, is, an, effective, inhibitor, of, plasma, membrane, ca, 2, atpase, xenon, inhibits, ca, 2, atpase, by, binding, to, a, hydrophobic, pore, within, the, enzyme, and, preventing, the, enzyme, from, assuming, active, conformations, xenon, is, a, competitive, inhibitor, of, the, serotonin, 5, ht, 3, receptor, while, neither, anesthetic, nor, antinociceptive, this, reduces, anesthesia, emergent, nausea, and, vomiting, xenon, has, a, minimum, alveolar, concentration, mac, of, 72, at, age, 40, making, it, 44, more, potent, than, n, 2, o, as, an, anesthetic, thus, it, can, be, used, with, oxygen, in, concentrations, that, have, a, lower, risk, of, hypoxia, unlike, nitrous, oxide, xenon, is, not, a, greenhouse, gas, and, is, viewed, as, environmentally, friendly, though, recycled, in, modern, systems, xenon, vented, to, the, atmosphere, is, only, returning, to, its, original, source, without, environmental, impact, xenon, induces, robust, cardioprotection, and, neuroprotection, through, a, variety, of, mechanisms, through, its, influence, on, ca, 2, k, katp, hif, and, nmda, antagonism, xenon, is, neuroprotective, when, administered, before, during, and, after, ischemic, insults, xenon, is, a, high, affinity, antagonist, at, the, nmda, receptor, glycine, site, xenon, is, cardioprotective, in, ischemia, reperfusion, conditions, by, inducing, pharmacologic, non, ischemic, preconditioning, xenon, is, cardioprotective, by, activating, pkc, epsilon, and, downstream, p38, mapk, xenon, mimics, neuronal, ischemic, preconditioning, by, activating, atp, sensitive, potassium, channels, xenon, allosterically, reduces, atp, mediated, channel, activation, inhibition, independently, of, the, sulfonylurea, receptor1, subunit, increasing, katp, open, channel, time, and, frequency, inhaling, a, xenon, oxygen, mixture, activates, production, of, the, transcription, factor, hif, 1, alpha, which, may, lead, to, increased, production, of, erythropoietin, the, latter, hormone, is, known, to, increase, red, blood, cell, production, and, athletic, performance, reportedly, doping, with, xenon, inhalation, has, been, used, in, russia, since, 2004, and, perhaps, earlier, on, august, 31, 2014, the, world, anti, doping, agency, wada, added, xenon, and, argon, to, the, list, of, prohibited, substances, and, methods, although, no, reliable, doping, tests, for, these, gases, have, yet, been, developed, in, addition, effects, of, xenon, on, erythropoietin, production, in, humans, have, not, been, demonstrated, so, far, gamma, emission, from, the, radioisotope, 133, xe, of, xenon, can, be, used, to, image, the, heart, lungs, and, brain, for, example, by, means, of, single, photon, emission, computed, tomography, 133, xe, has, also, been, used, to, measure, blood, flow, xenon, particularly, hyperpolarized, 129, xe, is, a, useful, contrast, agent, for, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, in, the, gas, phase, it, can, image, cavities, in, a, porous, sample, alveoli, in, lungs, or, the, flow, of, gases, within, the, lungs, because, xenon, is, soluble, both, in, water, and, in, hydrophobic, solvents, it, can, image, various, soft, living, tissues, xenon, 129, is, currently, being, used, as, a, visualization, agent, in, mri, scans, when, a, patient, inhales, hyperpolarized, xenon, 129, ventilation, and, gas, exchange, in, the, lungs, can, be, imaged, and, quantified, unlike, xenon, 133, xenon, 129, is, non, ionizing, and, is, safe, to, be, inhaled, with, no, adverse, effects, the, xenon, chloride, excimer, laser, has, certain, dermatological, uses, because, of, the, xenon, atom, s, large, flexible, outer, electron, shell, the, nmr, spectrum, changes, in, response, to, surrounding, conditions, and, can, be, used, to, monitor, the, surrounding, chemical, circumstances, for, instance, xenon, dissolved, in, water, xenon, dissolved, in, hydrophobic, solvent, and, xenon, associated, with, certain, proteins, can, be, distinguished, by, nmr, hyperpolarized, xenon, can, be, used, by, surface, chemists, normally, it, is, difficult, to, characterize, surfaces, with, nmr, because, signals, from, a, surface, are, overwhelmed, by, signals, from, the, atomic, nuclei, in, the, bulk, of, the, sample, which, are, much, more, numerous, than, surface, nuclei, however, nuclear, spins, on, solid, surfaces, can, be, selectively, polarized, by, transferring, spin, polarization, to, them, from, hyperpolarized, xenon, gas, this, makes, the, surface, signals, strong, enough, to, measure, and, distinguish, from, bulk, signals, in, nuclear, energy, studies, xenon, is, used, in, bubble, chambers, probes, and, in, other, areas, where, a, high, molecular, weight, and, inert, chemistry, is, desirable, a, by, product, of, nuclear, weapon, testing, is, the, release, of, radioactive, xenon, 133, and, xenon, 135, these, isotopes, are, monitored, to, ensure, compliance, with, nuclear, test, ban, treaties, and, to, confirm, nuclear, tests, by, states, such, as, north, korea, liquid, xenon, is, used, in, calorimeters, to, measure, gamma, rays, and, as, a, detector, of, hypothetical, weakly, interacting, massive, particles, or, wimps, when, a, wimp, collides, with, a, xenon, nucleus, theory, predicts, it, will, impart, enough, energy, to, cause, ionization, and, scintillation, liquid, xenon, is, useful, for, these, experiments, because, its, density, makes, dark, matter, interaction, more, likely, and, it, permits, a, quiet, detector, through, self, shielding, xenon, is, the, preferred, propellant, for, ion, propulsion, of, spacecraft, because, it, has, low, ionization, potential, per, atomic, weight, and, can, be, stored, as, a, liquid, at, near, room, temperature, under, high, pressure, yet, easily, evaporated, to, feed, the, engine, xenon, is, inert, environmentally, friendly, and, less, corrosive, to, an, ion, engine, than, other, fuels, such, as, mercury, or, cesium, xenon, was, first, used, for, satellite, ion, engines, during, the, 1970s, it, was, later, employed, as, a, propellant, for, jpl, s, deep, space, 1, probe, europe, s, smart, 1, spacecraft, and, for, the, three, ion, propulsion, engines, on, nasa, s, dawn, spacecraft, chemically, the, perxenate, compounds, are, used, as, oxidizing, agents, in, analytical, chemistry, xenon, difluoride, is, used, as, an, etchant, for, silicon, particularly, in, the, production, of, microelectromechanical, systems, mems, the, anticancer, drug, 5, fluorouracil, can, be, produced, by, reacting, xenon, difluoride, with, uracil, xenon, is, also, used, in, protein, crystallography, applied, at, pressures, from, 0, 5, to, 5, mpa, 5, to, 50, atm, to, a, protein, crystal, xenon, atoms, bind, in, predominantly, hydrophobic, cavities, often, creating, a, high, quality, isomorphous, heavy, atom, derivative, that, can, be, used, for, solving, the, phase, problem, xenon, gas, can, be, safely, kept, in, normal, sealed, glass, or, metal, containers, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, however, it, readily, dissolves, in, most, plastics, and, rubber, and, will, gradually, escape, from, a, container, sealed, with, such, materials, xenon, is, non, toxic, although, it, does, dissolve, in, blood, and, belongs, to, a, select, group, of, substances, that, penetrate, the, blood, brain, barrier, causing, mild, to, full, surgical, anesthesia, when, inhaled, in, high, concentrations, with, oxygen, the, speed, of, sound, in, xenon, gas, 169, m, s, is, less, than, that, in, air, because, the, average, velocity, of, the, heavy, xenon, atoms, is, less, than, that, of, nitrogen, and, oxygen, molecules, in, air, hence, xenon, vibrates, more, slowly, in, the, vocal, cords, when, exhaled, and, produces, lowered, voice, tones, low, frequency, enhanced, sounds, but, the, fundamental, frequency, or, pitch, does, not, change, an, effect, opposite, to, the, high, toned, voice, produced, in, helium, specifically, when, the, vocal, tract, is, filled, with, xenon, gas, its, natural, resonant, frequency, becomes, lower, than, when, it, is, filled, with, air, thus, the, low, frequencies, of, the, sound, wave, produced, by, the, same, direct, vibration, of, the, vocal, cords, would, be, enhanced, resulting, in, a, change, of, the, timbre, of, the, sound, amplified, by, the, vocal, tract, like, helium, xenon, does, not, satisfy, the, body, s, need, for, oxygen, and, it, is, both, a, simple, asphyxiant, and, an, anesthetic, more, powerful, than, nitrous, oxide, consequently, and, because, xenon, is, expensive, many, universities, have, prohibited, the, voice, stunt, as, a, general, chemistry, demonstration, the, gas, sulfur, hexafluoride, is, similar, to, xenon, in, molecular, weight, 146, versus, 131, less, expensive, and, though, an, asphyxiant, not, toxic, or, anesthetic, it, is, often, substituted, in, these, demonstrations, dense, gases, such, as, xenon, and, sulfur, hexafluoride, can, be, breathed, safely, when, mixed, with, at, least, 20, oxygen, xenon, at, 80, concentration, along, with, 20, oxygen, rapidly, produces, the, unconsciousness, of, general, anesthesia, breathing, mixes, gases, of, different, densities, very, effectively, and, rapidly, so, that, heavier, gases, are, purged, along, with, the, oxygen, and, do, not, accumulate, at, the, bottom, of, the, lungs, there, is, however, a, danger, associated, with, any, heavy, gas, in, large, quantities, it, may, sit, invisibly, in, a, container, and, a, person, who, enters, an, area, filled, with, an, odorless, colorless, gas, may, be, asphyxiated, without, warning, xenon, is, rarely, used, in, large, enough, quantities, for, this, to, be, a, concern, though, the, potential, for, danger, exists, any, time, a, tank, or, container, of, xenon, is, kept, in, an, unventilated, space, water, soluble, xenon, compounds, such, as, monosodium, xenate, are, moderately, toxic, but, have, a, very, short, half, life, of, the, body, intravenously, injected, xenate, is, reduced, to, elemental, xenon, in, about, a, minute
