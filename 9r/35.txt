a, light, year, alternatively, spelled, light, year, ly, or, lyr, is, a, unit, of, length, used, to, express, astronomical, distances, and, is, equal, to, exactly, 9, 460, 730, 472, 580, 8, km, scientific, notation, 9, 4607304725808, 10, 12, km, which, is, approximately, 5, 88, trillion, mi, as, defined, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, a, light, year, is, the, distance, that, light, travels, in, a, vacuum, in, one, julian, year, 365, 25, days, because, it, includes, the, word, year, the, term, is, sometimes, misinterpreted, as, a, unit, of, time, the, light, year, is, most, often, used, when, expressing, distances, to, stars, and, other, distances, on, a, galactic, scale, especially, in, non, specialist, contexts, and, popular, science, publications, the, unit, most, commonly, used, in, professional, astronomy, is, the, parsec, symbol, pc, about, 3, 26, light, years, as, defined, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, the, light, year, is, the, product, of, the, julian, year, 365, 25, days, as, opposed, to, the, 365, 2425, day, gregorian, year, or, the, 365, 24219, day, tropical, year, that, both, approximate, and, the, speed, of, light, 299, 792, 458, m, s, both, of, these, values, are, included, in, the, iau, 1976, system, of, astronomical, constants, used, since, 1984, from, this, the, following, conversions, can, be, derived, the, abbreviation, used, by, the, iau, for, light, year, is, ly, international, standards, like, iso, 80000, 2006, now, superseded, have, used, l, y, and, localized, abbreviations, are, frequent, such, as, al, in, french, spanish, and, italian, from, ann, e, lumi, re, a, o, luz, and, anno, luce, respectively, lj, in, german, from, lichtjahr, etc, before, 1984, the, tropical, year, not, the, julian, year, and, a, measured, not, defined, speed, of, light, were, included, in, the, iau, 1964, system, of, astronomical, constants, used, from, 1968, to, 1983, the, product, of, simon, newcomb, s, j1900, 0, mean, tropical, year, of, 31, 556, 925, 9747, ephemeris, seconds, and, a, speed, of, light, of, 299, 792, 5, km, s, produced, a, light, year, of, 9, 460, 530, 10, 15, m, rounded, to, the, seven, significant, digits, in, the, speed, of, light, found, in, several, modern, sources, was, probably, derived, from, an, old, source, such, as, c, w, allen, s, 1973, astrophysical, quantities, reference, work, which, was, updated, in, 2000, including, the, iau, 1976, value, cited, above, truncated, to, 10, significant, digits, other, high, precision, values, are, not, derived, from, a, coherent, iau, system, a, value, of, 9, 460, 536, 207, 10, 15, m, found, in, some, modern, sources, is, the, product, of, a, mean, gregorian, year, 365, 2425, days, or, 31, 556, 952, s, and, the, defined, speed, of, light, 299, 792, 458, m, s, another, value, 9, 460, 528, 405, 10, 15, m, is, the, product, of, the, j1900, 0, mean, tropical, year, and, the, defined, speed, of, light, abbreviations, used, for, light, years, and, multiples, of, light, years, are, the, light, year, unit, appeared, a, few, years, after, the, first, successful, measurement, of, the, distance, to, a, star, other, than, the, sun, by, friedrich, bessel, in, 1838, the, star, was, 61, cygni, and, he, used, a, 160, millimetre, 6, 2, in, heliometre, designed, by, joseph, von, fraunhofer, the, largest, unit, for, expressing, distances, across, space, at, that, time, was, the, astronomical, unit, equal, to, the, radius, of, the, earth, s, orbit, at, 150, million, kilometres, 93, million, miles, in, those, terms, trigonometric, calculations, based, on, 61, cygni, s, parallax, of, 0, 314, arcseconds, showed, the, distance, to, the, star, to, be, 660, 000, astronomical, units, 9, 9, 10, 13, km, 6, 1, 10, 13, mi, bessel, added, that, light, takes, 10, 3, years, to, traverse, this, distance, he, recognized, that, his, readers, would, enjoy, the, mental, picture, of, the, approximate, transit, time, for, light, but, he, refrained, from, using, the, light, year, as, a, unit, he, may, have, resisted, expressing, distances, in, light, years, because, it, would, reduce, the, accuracy, of, his, parallax, data, due, to, multiplying, with, the, uncertain, parameter, of, the, speed, of, light, the, speed, of, light, was, not, yet, precisely, known, in, 1838, the, estimate, of, its, value, changed, in, 1849, fizeau, and, 1862, foucault, it, was, not, yet, considered, to, be, a, fundamental, constant, of, nature, and, the, propagation, of, light, through, the, aether, or, space, was, still, enigmatic, the, light, year, unit, appeared, in, 1851, in, a, german, popular, astronomical, article, by, otto, ule, ule, explained, the, oddity, of, a, distance, unit, name, ending, in, year, by, comparing, it, to, a, walking, hour, wegstunde, a, contemporary, german, popular, astronomical, book, also, noticed, that, light, year, is, an, odd, name, in, 1868, an, english, journal, labelled, the, light, year, as, a, unit, used, by, the, germans, eddington, called, the, light, year, an, inconvenient, and, irrelevant, unit, which, had, sometimes, crept, from, popular, use, into, technical, investigations, although, modern, astronomers, often, prefer, to, use, the, parsec, light, years, are, also, popularly, used, to, gauge, the, expanses, of, interstellar, and, intergalactic, space, distances, expressed, in, light, years, include, those, between, stars, in, the, same, general, area, such, as, those, belonging, to, the, same, spiral, arm, or, globular, cluster, galaxies, themselves, span, from, a, few, thousand, to, a, few, hundred, thousand, light, years, in, diameter, and, are, separated, from, neighbouring, galaxies, and, galaxy, clusters, by, millions, of, light, years, distances, to, objects, such, as, quasars, and, the, sloan, great, wall, run, up, into, the, billions, of, light, years, distances, between, objects, within, a, star, system, tend, to, be, small, fractions, of, a, light, year, and, are, usually, expressed, in, astronomical, units, however, smaller, units, of, length, can, similarly, be, formed, usefully, by, multiplying, units, of, time, by, the, speed, of, light, for, example, the, light, second, useful, in, astronomy, telecommunications, and, relativistic, physics, is, exactly, 299, 792, 458, metres, or, 1, 31, 557, 600, of, a, light, year, units, such, as, the, light, minute, light, hour, and, light, day, are, sometimes, used, in, popular, science, publications, the, light, month, roughly, one, twelfth, of, a, light, year, is, also, used, occasionally, for, approximate, measures, the, hayden, planetarium, specifies, the, light, month, more, precisely, as, 30, days, of, light, travel, time, light, travels, approximately, one, foot, in, a, nanosecond, the, term, light, foot, is, sometimes, used, as, an, informal, measure, of, time
