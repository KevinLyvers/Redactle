inertia, is, the, natural, tendency, of, objects, in, motion, to, stay, in, motion, and, objects, at, rest, to, stay, at, rest, unless, a, force, causes, its, speed, or, direction, to, change, it, is, one, of, the, fundamental, principles, in, classical, physics, and, described, by, isaac, newton, in, his, first, law, of, motion, also, known, as, the, principle, of, inertia, it, is, one, of, the, primary, manifestations, of, mass, one, of, the, core, quantitative, properties, of, physical, systems, newton, writes, law, i, every, object, perseveres, in, its, state, of, rest, or, of, uniform, motion, in, a, right, line, except, insofar, as, it, is, compelled, to, change, that, state, by, forces, impressed, thereon, in, his, 1687, work, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, newton, defined, inertia, as, a, property, definition, iii, the, vis, insita, or, innate, force, of, matter, is, a, power, of, resisting, by, which, every, body, as, much, as, in, it, lies, endeavours, to, persevere, in, its, present, state, whether, it, be, of, rest, or, of, moving, uniformly, forward, in, a, right, line, professor, john, h, lienhard, points, out, the, mozi, based, on, a, chinese, text, from, the, warring, states, period, 475, 221, bce, as, having, given, the, first, description, of, inertia, before, the, european, renaissance, the, prevailing, theory, of, motion, in, western, philosophy, was, that, of, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, inertia, property, of, physical, objects, is, often, masked, by, gravity, and, the, effects, of, friction, and, air, resistance, both, of, which, tend, to, decrease, the, speed, of, moving, objects, commonly, to, the, point, of, rest, this, misled, the, philosopher, aristotle, to, believe, that, objects, would, move, only, as, long, as, force, was, applied, to, them, aristotle, said, that, all, moving, objects, on, earth, eventually, come, to, rest, unless, an, external, power, force, continued, to, move, them, aristotle, explained, the, continued, motion, of, projectiles, after, being, separated, from, their, projector, as, an, itself, unexplained, action, of, the, surrounding, medium, continuing, to, move, the, projectile, despite, its, general, acceptance, aristotle, s, concept, of, motion, was, disputed, on, several, occasions, by, notable, philosophers, over, nearly, two, millennia, for, example, lucretius, following, presumably, epicurus, stated, that, the, default, state, of, the, matter, was, motion, not, stasis, stagnation, in, the, 6th, century, john, philoponus, criticized, the, inconsistency, between, aristotle, s, discussion, of, projectiles, where, the, medium, keeps, projectiles, going, and, his, discussion, of, the, void, where, the, medium, would, hinder, a, body, s, motion, philoponus, proposed, that, motion, was, not, maintained, by, the, action, of, a, surrounding, medium, but, by, some, property, imparted, to, the, object, when, it, was, set, in, motion, although, this, was, not, the, modern, concept, of, inertia, for, there, was, still, the, need, for, a, power, to, keep, a, body, in, motion, it, proved, a, fundamental, step, in, that, direction, this, view, was, strongly, opposed, by, averroes, and, by, many, scholastic, philosophers, who, supported, aristotle, however, this, view, did, not, go, unchallenged, in, the, islamic, world, where, philoponus, had, several, supporters, who, further, developed, his, ideas, in, the, 11th, century, persian, polymath, ibn, sina, avicenna, claimed, that, a, projectile, in, a, vacuum, would, not, stop, unless, acted, upon, in, the, 14th, century, jean, buridan, rejected, the, notion, that, a, motion, generating, property, which, he, named, impetus, dissipated, spontaneously, buridan, s, position, was, that, a, moving, object, would, be, arrested, by, the, resistance, of, the, air, and, the, weight, of, the, body, which, would, oppose, its, impetus, buridan, also, maintained, that, impetus, increased, with, speed, thus, his, initial, idea, of, impetus, was, similar, in, many, ways, to, the, modern, concept, of, momentum, despite, the, obvious, similarities, to, more, modern, ideas, of, inertia, buridan, saw, his, theory, as, only, a, modification, to, aristotle, s, basic, philosophy, maintaining, many, other, peripatetic, views, including, the, belief, that, there, was, still, a, fundamental, difference, between, an, object, in, motion, and, an, object, at, rest, buridan, also, believed, that, impetus, could, be, not, only, linear, but, also, circular, in, nature, causing, objects, such, as, celestial, bodies, to, move, in, a, circle, buridan, s, theory, was, followed, up, by, his, pupil, albert, of, saxony, 1316, 1390, and, the, oxford, calculators, who, performed, various, experiments, which, further, undermined, the, aristotelian, model, their, work, in, turn, was, elaborated, by, nicole, oresme, who, pioneered, the, practice, of, illustrating, the, laws, of, motion, with, graphs, shortly, before, galileo, s, theory, of, inertia, giambattista, benedetti, modified, the, growing, theory, of, impetus, to, involve, linear, motion, alone, portion, of, corporeal, matter, which, moves, by, itself, when, an, impetus, has, been, impressed, on, it, by, any, external, motive, force, has, a, natural, tendency, to, move, on, a, rectilinear, not, a, curved, path, benedetti, cites, the, motion, of, a, rock, in, a, sling, as, an, example, of, the, inherent, linear, motion, of, objects, forced, into, circular, motion, according, to, charles, coulston, gillispie, inertia, entered, science, as, a, physical, consequence, of, descartes, geometrization, of, space, matter, combined, with, the, immutability, of, god, the, first, physicist, to, completely, break, away, from, the, aristotelian, model, of, motion, was, isaac, beeckman, in, 1614, the, term, inertia, was, first, introduced, by, johannes, kepler, in, his, epitome, astronomiae, copernicanae, published, in, three, parts, from, 1617, to, 1621, however, the, meaning, of, kepler, s, term, which, he, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, idleness, or, laziness, was, not, quite, the, same, as, its, modern, interpretation, kepler, defined, inertia, only, in, terms, of, resistance, to, movement, once, again, based, on, the, presumption, that, rest, was, a, natural, state, which, did, not, need, explanation, it, was, not, until, the, later, work, of, galileo, and, newton, unified, rest, and, motion, in, one, principle, that, the, term, inertia, could, be, applied, to, these, concepts, as, it, is, today, the, principle, of, inertia, as, formulated, by, aristotle, for, motions, in, a, void, includes, that, a, mundane, object, tends, to, resist, a, change, in, motion, the, aristotelian, division, of, motion, into, mundane, and, celestial, became, increasingly, problematic, in, the, face, of, the, conclusions, of, nicolaus, copernicus, in, the, 16th, century, who, argued, that, the, earth, is, never, at, rest, but, is, actually, in, constant, motion, around, the, sun, galileo, in, his, further, development, of, the, copernican, model, recognized, these, problems, with, the, then, accepted, nature, of, motion, and, at, least, partially, as, a, result, included, a, restatement, of, aristotle, s, description, of, motion, in, a, void, as, a, basic, physical, principle, a, body, moving, on, a, level, surface, will, continue, in, the, same, direction, at, a, constant, speed, unless, disturbed, galileo, writes, that, all, external, impediments, removed, a, heavy, body, on, a, spherical, surface, concentric, with, the, earth, will, maintain, itself, in, that, state, in, which, it, has, been, if, placed, in, a, movement, towards, the, west, for, example, it, will, maintain, itself, in, that, movement, this, notion, which, is, termed, circular, inertia, or, horizontal, circular, inertia, by, historians, of, science, is, a, precursor, to, but, is, distinct, from, newton, s, notion, of, rectilinear, inertia, for, galileo, a, motion, is, horizontal, if, it, does, not, carry, the, moving, body, towards, or, away, from, the, center, of, the, earth, and, for, him, a, ship, for, instance, having, once, received, some, impetus, through, the, tranquil, sea, would, move, continually, around, our, globe, without, ever, stopping, it, is, also, worth, noting, that, galileo, later, in, 1632, concluded, that, based, on, this, initial, premise, of, inertia, it, is, impossible, to, tell, the, difference, between, a, moving, object, and, a, stationary, one, without, some, outside, reference, to, compare, it, against, this, observation, ultimately, came, to, be, the, basis, for, albert, einstein, to, develop, the, theory, of, special, relativity, concepts, of, inertia, in, galileo, s, writings, would, later, come, to, be, refined, modified, and, codified, by, isaac, newton, as, the, first, of, his, laws, of, motion, first, published, in, newton, s, work, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, in, 1687, every, body, perseveres, in, its, state, of, rest, or, of, uniform, motion, in, a, right, line, unless, it, is, compelled, to, change, that, state, by, forces, impressed, thereon, despite, having, defined, the, concept, in, his, laws, of, motion, newton, did, not, actually, use, the, term, inertia, in, fact, originally, he, viewed, the, respective, phenomenon, as, being, caused, by, innate, forces, inherent, in, matter, which, resisted, any, acceleration, given, this, perspective, and, borrowing, from, kepler, newton, attributed, the, term, inertia, to, mean, the, innate, force, possessed, by, an, object, which, resists, changes, in, motion, thus, newton, defined, inertia, to, mean, the, cause, of, the, phenomenon, rather, than, the, phenomenon, itself, however, newton, s, original, ideas, of, innate, resistive, force, were, ultimately, problematic, for, a, variety, of, reasons, and, thus, most, physicists, no, longer, think, in, these, terms, as, no, alternate, mechanism, has, been, readily, accepted, and, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, there, may, not, be, one, that, we, can, know, the, term, inertia, has, come, to, mean, simply, the, phenomenon, itself, rather, than, any, inherent, mechanism, thus, ultimately, inertia, in, modern, classical, physics, has, come, to, be, a, name, for, the, same, phenomenon, as, described, by, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, and, the, two, concepts, are, now, considered, to, be, equivalent, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, as, proposed, in, his, 1905, paper, entitled, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, was, built, on, the, understanding, of, inertial, reference, frames, developed, by, galileo, huygens, and, newton, while, this, revolutionary, theory, did, significantly, change, the, meaning, of, many, newtonian, concepts, such, as, mass, energy, and, distance, einstein, s, concept, of, inertia, remained, at, first, unchanged, from, newton, s, original, meaning, however, this, resulted, in, a, limitation, inherent, in, special, relativity, the, principle, of, relativity, could, only, apply, to, inertial, reference, frames, to, address, this, limitation, einstein, developed, his, general, theory, of, relativity, the, foundation, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, 1916, which, provided, a, theory, including, noninertial, accelerated, reference, frames, in, general, relativity, the, concept, of, inertial, motion, got, a, broader, meaning, taking, into, account, general, relativity, inertial, motion, is, any, movement, of, a, body, that, is, not, affected, by, forces, of, electrical, magnetic, or, other, origin, but, that, is, only, under, the, influence, of, gravitational, masses, physically, speaking, this, happens, to, be, exactly, what, a, properly, functioning, three, axis, accelerometer, is, indicating, when, it, does, not, detect, any, proper, acceleration, the, term, inertia, comes, from, the, latin, word, iners, meaning, idle, or, sluggish, a, quantity, related, to, inertia, is, rotational, inertia, moment, of, inertia, the, property, that, a, rotating, rigid, body, maintains, its, state, of, uniform, rotational, motion, its, angular, momentum, remains, unchanged, unless, an, external, torque, is, applied, this, is, called, conservation, of, angular, momentum, rotational, inertia, is, often, considered, in, relation, to, a, rigid, body, for, example, a, gyroscope, uses, the, property, that, it, resists, any, change, in, the, axis, of, rotation
