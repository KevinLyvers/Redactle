a, river, is, a, natural, freshwater, stream, that, flows, on, land, or, inside, caves, towards, another, body, of, water, at, a, lower, elevation, such, as, an, ocean, lake, or, another, river, a, river, may, run, dry, before, reaching, the, end, of, its, course, if, it, runs, out, of, water, or, only, flow, during, certain, seasons, rivers, are, regulated, by, the, water, cycle, the, processes, by, which, water, moves, around, the, earth, water, first, enters, rivers, through, precipitation, whether, from, the, runoff, of, water, down, a, slope, the, melting, of, glaciers, or, snow, or, seepage, from, aquifers, beneath, the, surface, of, the, earth, rivers, flow, and, merge, in, confluences, to, form, drainage, basins, areas, where, all, water, eventually, flows, to, a, common, outlet, rivers, have, a, great, effect, on, the, landscape, around, them, they, may, regularly, overflow, their, banks, and, flood, the, surrounding, area, spreading, nutrients, to, the, surrounding, area, sediment, or, alluvium, carried, by, rivers, shapes, the, landscape, around, it, forming, deltas, and, islands, where, the, flow, slows, down, rivers, rarely, run, in, a, straight, line, instead, they, bend, or, meander, the, locations, of, a, river, s, banks, can, change, frequently, rivers, get, their, alluvium, from, erosion, which, carves, rock, into, canyons, and, valleys, rivers, have, sustained, human, and, animal, life, for, millennia, including, the, first, human, civilizations, the, organisms, that, live, around, or, in, a, river, such, as, fish, aquatic, plants, and, insects, have, different, roles, including, processing, organic, matter, and, predation, rivers, have, produced, abundant, resources, for, humans, including, food, transportation, drinking, water, and, recreation, humans, have, engineered, rivers, to, prevent, flooding, irrigate, crops, perform, work, with, water, wheels, and, produce, hydroelectricity, from, dams, people, associate, rivers, with, life, and, fertility, and, have, strong, religious, political, social, and, mythological, attachments, to, them, rivers, and, river, ecosystems, are, threatened, by, water, pollution, climate, change, and, human, activity, the, construction, of, dams, canals, levees, and, other, engineered, structures, has, eliminated, habitats, has, caused, the, extinction, of, some, species, and, lowered, the, amount, of, alluvium, flowing, through, rivers, decreased, snowfall, from, climate, change, has, resulted, in, less, water, available, for, rivers, during, the, summer, regulation, of, pollution, dam, removal, and, sewage, treatment, have, helped, to, improve, water, quality, and, restore, river, habitats, a, river, is, a, natural, flow, of, freshwater, that, flows, on, or, through, land, towards, another, body, of, water, downhill, this, flow, can, be, into, a, lake, an, ocean, or, another, river, a, stream, refers, to, water, that, flows, in, a, natural, channel, a, geographic, feature, that, can, contain, flowing, water, a, stream, may, also, be, referred, to, as, a, watercourse, the, study, of, the, movement, of, water, as, it, occurs, on, earth, is, called, hydrology, and, their, effect, on, the, landscape, is, covered, by, geomorphology, rivers, are, part, of, the, water, cycle, the, continuous, processes, by, which, water, moves, about, earth, this, means, that, all, water, that, flows, in, rivers, must, ultimately, come, from, precipitation, the, sides, of, rivers, have, land, that, is, at, a, higher, elevation, than, the, river, itself, and, in, these, areas, water, flows, downhill, into, the, river, the, headwaters, of, a, river, are, the, smaller, streams, that, feed, a, river, and, make, up, the, river, s, source, these, streams, may, be, small, and, flow, rapidly, down, the, sides, of, mountains, all, of, the, land, uphill, of, a, river, that, feeds, it, with, water, in, this, way, is, in, that, river, s, drainage, basin, or, watershed, a, ridge, of, higher, elevation, land, is, what, typically, separates, drainage, basins, water, on, one, side, of, a, ridge, will, flow, into, one, set, of, rivers, and, water, on, the, other, side, will, flow, into, another, one, example, of, this, is, the, continental, divide, of, the, americas, in, the, rocky, mountains, water, on, the, western, side, of, the, divide, flows, into, the, pacific, ocean, whereas, water, on, the, other, side, flows, into, the, atlantic, ocean, not, all, precipitation, flows, directly, into, rivers, some, water, seeps, into, underground, aquifers, these, in, turn, can, still, feed, rivers, via, the, water, table, the, groundwater, beneath, the, surface, of, the, land, stored, in, the, soil, water, flows, into, rivers, in, places, where, the, river, s, elevation, is, lower, than, that, of, the, water, table, this, phenomenon, is, why, rivers, can, still, flow, even, during, times, of, drought, rivers, are, also, fed, by, the, melting, of, snow, glaciers, present, in, higher, elevation, regions, in, summer, months, higher, temperatures, melt, snow, and, ice, causing, additional, water, to, flow, into, rivers, glacier, melt, can, supplement, snow, melt, in, times, like, the, late, summer, when, there, may, be, less, snow, left, to, melt, helping, to, ensure, that, the, rivers, downstream, of, the, glaciers, have, a, continuous, supply, of, water, rivers, flow, downhill, with, their, direction, determined, by, gravity, a, common, misconception, holds, that, all, or, most, rivers, flow, from, north, to, south, but, this, is, not, true, as, rivers, flow, downstream, they, eventually, merge, to, form, larger, rivers, a, river, that, feeds, into, another, is, a, tributary, and, the, place, they, meet, is, a, confluence, rivers, must, flow, to, lower, altitudes, due, to, gravity, the, bed, of, a, river, is, typically, within, a, river, valley, between, hills, or, mountains, rivers, flowing, through, an, impermeable, section, of, land, such, as, rocks, will, erode, the, slopes, on, the, sides, of, the, river, when, a, river, carves, a, plateau, or, a, similar, high, elevation, area, a, canyon, can, form, with, cliffs, on, either, side, of, the, river, areas, of, a, river, with, softer, rock, weather, faster, than, areas, with, harder, rock, causing, a, difference, in, elevation, between, two, points, of, a, river, this, can, cause, the, formation, of, a, waterfall, as, the, river, s, flow, falls, down, a, vertical, drop, a, river, in, a, permeable, area, does, not, exhibit, this, behavior, and, may, even, have, raised, banks, due, to, sediment, rivers, also, change, their, landscape, through, their, transportation, of, sediment, often, known, as, alluvium, when, applied, specifically, to, rivers, this, debris, comes, from, erosion, performed, by, the, rivers, themselves, debris, swept, into, rivers, by, rainfall, as, well, as, erosion, caused, by, the, slow, movement, of, glaciers, the, sand, in, deserts, and, the, sediment, that, forms, bar, islands, is, from, rivers, the, particle, size, of, the, debris, is, gradually, sorted, by, the, river, with, heavier, particles, like, rocks, sinking, to, the, bottom, and, finer, particles, like, sand, or, silt, carried, further, downriver, this, sediment, may, be, deposited, in, river, valleys, or, carried, to, the, sea, the, sediment, yield, of, a, river, is, the, quantity, of, sand, per, unit, area, within, a, watershed, that, is, removed, over, a, period, of, time, the, monitoring, of, the, sediment, yield, of, a, river, is, important, for, ecologists, to, understand, the, health, of, its, ecosystems, the, rate, of, erosion, of, the, river, s, environment, and, the, effects, of, human, activity, rivers, rarely, run, in, a, straight, direction, instead, preferring, to, bend, or, meander, this, is, because, any, natural, impediment, to, the, flow, of, the, river, may, cause, the, current, to, deflect, in, a, different, direction, when, this, happens, the, alluvium, carried, by, the, river, can, build, up, against, this, impediment, redirecting, the, course, of, the, river, the, flow, is, then, directed, against, the, opposite, bank, of, the, river, which, will, erode, into, a, more, concave, shape, to, accommodate, the, flow, the, bank, will, still, block, the, flow, causing, it, to, reflect, in, the, other, direction, thus, a, bend, in, the, river, is, created, rivers, may, run, through, low, flat, regions, on, their, way, to, the, sea, these, places, may, have, floodplains, that, are, periodically, flooded, when, there, is, a, high, level, of, water, running, through, the, river, these, events, may, be, referred, to, as, wet, seasons, and, dry, seasons, when, the, flooding, is, predictable, due, to, the, climate, the, alluvium, carried, by, rivers, laden, with, minerals, is, deposited, into, the, floodplain, when, the, banks, spill, over, providing, new, nutrients, to, the, soil, allowing, them, to, support, human, activity, like, farming, as, well, as, a, host, of, plant, and, animal, life, deposited, sediment, from, rivers, can, form, temporary, or, long, lasting, fluvial, islands, these, islands, exist, in, almost, every, river, about, half, of, all, waterways, on, earth, are, intermittent, rivers, which, do, not, always, have, a, continuous, flow, of, water, throughout, the, year, this, may, be, because, an, arid, climate, is, too, dry, depending, on, the, season, to, support, a, stream, or, because, a, river, is, seasonally, frozen, in, the, winter, such, as, in, an, area, with, substantial, permafrost, or, in, the, headwaters, of, rivers, in, mountains, where, snowmelt, is, required, to, fuel, the, river, these, rivers, can, appear, in, a, variety, of, climates, and, still, provide, a, habitat, for, aquatic, life, and, perform, other, ecological, functions, non, perennial, rivers, are, believed, to, have, once, flowed, on, mars, subterranean, rivers, may, flow, underground, through, flooded, caves, this, can, happen, in, karst, systems, where, rock, dissolves, to, form, caves, these, rivers, provide, a, habitat, for, diverse, microorganisms, and, have, become, an, important, target, of, study, by, microbiologists, other, rivers, and, streams, have, been, covered, over, or, converted, to, run, in, tunnels, due, to, human, development, these, rivers, do, not, typically, host, any, life, and, are, often, used, only, for, stormwater, or, flood, control, one, such, example, is, the, sunswick, creek, in, new, york, city, which, was, covered, in, the, 1800s, and, now, exists, only, as, a, sewer, like, pipe, while, rivers, may, flow, into, lakes, or, man, made, features, such, as, reservoirs, the, water, they, contain, will, always, tend, to, flow, down, toward, the, ocean, however, if, human, activity, siphons, too, much, water, away, from, a, river, for, other, uses, the, riverbed, may, run, dry, before, reaching, the, sea, the, outlets, mouth, of, a, river, can, take, several, forms, tidal, rivers, often, part, of, an, estuary, have, their, levels, rise, and, fall, with, the, tide, since, the, levels, of, these, rivers, are, often, already, at, or, near, sea, level, the, flow, of, alluvium, and, the, brackish, water, that, flows, in, these, rivers, may, be, either, upriver, or, downriver, depending, on, the, time, of, day, rivers, that, are, not, tidal, may, form, deltas, that, continuously, deposit, alluvium, into, the, sea, from, their, mouths, depending, on, the, activity, of, waves, the, strength, of, the, river, and, the, strength, of, the, tidal, current, the, sediment, can, accumulate, to, form, new, land, when, viewed, from, above, a, delta, can, appear, to, take, the, form, of, several, triangular, shapes, as, the, river, mouth, appears, to, fan, out, from, the, original, coastline, in, hydrology, a, stream, order, is, a, positive, integer, used, to, describe, the, level, of, river, branching, in, a, drainage, basin, several, systems, of, stream, order, exist, one, of, which, is, the, strahler, number, in, this, system, the, first, tributaries, of, a, river, are, 1st, order, rivers, when, two, 1st, order, rivers, merge, the, resulting, river, is, 2nd, order, if, a, river, of, a, higher, order, and, a, lower, order, merge, the, order, is, incremented, from, whichever, of, the, previous, rivers, had, the, higher, order, stream, order, is, correlated, with, and, thus, can, be, used, to, predict, certain, data, points, related, to, rivers, such, as, the, size, of, the, drainage, basin, drainage, area, and, the, length, of, the, channel, the, ecosystem, of, a, river, includes, the, life, that, lives, in, its, water, on, its, banks, and, in, the, surrounding, land, the, width, of, the, channel, of, a, river, its, velocity, and, how, shaded, it, is, by, nearby, trees, creatures, in, a, river, ecosystem, may, be, divided, into, many, roles, based, on, the, river, continuum, concept, shredders, are, organisms, that, consume, this, organic, material, the, role, of, a, grazer, or, scraper, organism, is, to, feed, on, the, algae, that, collects, on, rocks, and, plants, collectors, consume, the, detritus, of, dead, organisms, lastly, predators, feed, on, living, things, to, survive, the, river, can, then, be, modeled, by, the, availability, of, resources, for, each, creature, s, role, a, shady, area, with, deciduous, trees, might, experience, frequent, deposits, of, organic, matter, in, the, form, of, leaves, in, this, type, of, ecosystem, collectors, and, shredders, will, be, most, active, as, the, river, becomes, deeper, and, wider, it, may, move, slower, and, receive, more, sunlight, this, supports, invertebrates, and, a, variety, of, fish, as, well, as, scrapers, feeding, on, algae, further, downstream, the, river, may, get, most, of, its, energy, from, organic, matter, that, was, already, processed, upstream, by, collectors, and, shredders, predators, may, be, more, active, here, including, fish, that, feed, on, plants, plankton, and, other, fish, the, flood, pulse, concept, focuses, on, habitats, that, flood, seasonally, including, lakes, and, marshes, the, land, that, interfaces, with, a, water, body, is, that, body, s, riparian, zone, plants, in, the, riparian, zone, of, a, river, help, stabilize, its, banks, to, prevent, erosion, and, filter, alluvium, deposited, by, the, river, on, the, shore, including, processing, the, nitrogen, and, other, nutrients, it, contains, forests, in, a, riparian, zone, also, provide, important, animal, habitats, river, ecosystems, have, also, been, categorized, based, on, the, variety, of, aquatic, life, they, can, sustain, also, known, as, the, fish, zonation, concept, smaller, rivers, can, only, sustain, smaller, fish, that, can, comfortably, fit, in, its, waters, whereas, larger, rivers, can, contain, both, small, fish, and, large, fish, this, means, that, larger, rivers, can, host, a, larger, variety, of, species, this, is, analogous, to, the, species, area, relationship, the, concept, of, larger, habitats, being, host, to, more, species, in, this, case, it, is, known, as, the, species, discharge, relationship, referring, specifically, to, the, discharge, of, a, river, the, amount, of, water, passing, through, it, at, a, particular, time, the, flow, of, a, river, can, act, as, a, means, of, transportation, for, plant, and, animal, species, as, well, as, a, barrier, for, example, the, amazon, river, is, so, wide, in, parts, that, the, variety, of, species, on, either, side, of, its, basin, are, distinct, some, fish, may, swim, upstream, to, spawn, as, part, of, a, seasonal, migration, species, that, travel, from, the, sea, to, breed, in, freshwater, rivers, are, anadromous, salmon, are, an, anadromous, fish, that, may, die, in, the, river, after, spawning, contributing, nutrients, back, to, the, river, ecosystem, modern, river, engineering, involves, a, large, scale, collection, of, independent, river, engineering, structures, that, have, the, goal, of, flood, control, improved, navigation, recreation, and, ecosystem, management, many, of, these, projects, have, the, effect, of, normalizing, the, effects, of, rivers, the, greatest, floods, are, smaller, and, more, predictable, and, larger, sections, are, open, for, navigation, by, boats, and, other, watercraft, a, major, effect, of, river, engineering, has, been, a, reduced, sediment, output, of, large, rivers, for, example, the, mississippi, river, produced, 400, million, tons, of, sediment, per, year, due, to, the, construction, of, reservoirs, sediment, buildup, in, man, made, levees, and, the, removal, of, natural, banks, replaced, with, revetments, this, sediment, output, has, been, reduced, by, 60, the, most, basic, river, projects, involve, the, clearing, of, obstructions, like, fallen, trees, this, can, scale, up, to, dredging, the, excavation, of, sediment, buildup, in, a, channel, to, provide, a, deeper, area, for, navigation, these, activities, require, regular, maintenance, as, the, location, of, the, river, banks, changes, over, time, floods, bring, foreign, objects, into, the, river, and, natural, sediment, buildup, continues, artificial, channels, are, often, constructed, to, cut, off, winding, sections, of, a, river, with, a, shorter, path, or, to, direct, the, flow, of, a, river, in, a, straighter, direction, this, effect, known, as, channelization, has, made, the, distance, required, to, traverse, the, missouri, river, in, 116, kilometers, 72, mi, shorter, dikes, are, channels, built, perpendicular, to, the, flow, of, the, river, beneath, its, surface, these, help, rivers, flow, straighter, by, increasing, the, speed, of, the, water, at, the, middle, of, the, channel, helping, to, control, floods, levees, are, also, used, for, this, purpose, they, can, be, thought, of, as, dams, constructed, on, the, sides, of, rivers, meant, to, hold, back, water, from, flooding, the, surrounding, area, during, periods, of, high, rainfall, they, are, often, constructed, by, building, up, the, natural, terrain, with, soil, or, clay, some, levees, are, supplemented, with, floodways, channels, used, to, redirect, floodwater, away, from, farms, and, populated, areas, dams, restrict, the, flow, of, water, through, a, river, they, can, be, built, for, navigational, purposes, providing, a, higher, level, of, water, upstream, for, boats, to, travel, in, they, may, also, be, used, for, hydroelectricity, or, power, generation, from, rivers, dams, typically, transform, a, section, of, the, river, behind, them, into, a, lake, or, reservoir, this, can, provide, nearby, cities, with, a, predictable, supply, of, drinking, water, hydroelectricity, is, desirable, as, a, form, of, renewable, energy, that, does, not, require, any, inputs, beyond, the, river, itself, dams, are, very, common, worldwide, with, at, least, 75, 000, higher, than, 6, feet, 1, 8, m, in, the, u, s, globally, reservoirs, created, by, dams, cover, 193, 500, square, miles, 501, 000, km, 2, dam, building, reached, a, peak, in, the, 1970s, when, between, two, or, three, dams, were, completed, every, day, and, has, since, begun, to, decline, new, dam, projects, are, primarily, focused, in, china, india, and, other, areas, in, asia, the, first, civilizations, of, earth, were, born, on, floodplains, between, 5, 500, and, 3, 500, years, ago, the, freshwater, fertile, soil, and, transportation, provided, by, rivers, helped, create, the, conditions, for, complex, societies, to, emerge, three, such, civilizations, were, the, sumerians, in, the, tigris, euphrates, river, system, the, ancient, egyptian, civilization, in, the, nile, and, the, indus, valley, civilization, on, the, indus, river, the, desert, climates, of, the, surrounding, areas, made, these, societies, especially, reliant, on, rivers, for, survival, leading, to, people, clustering, in, these, areas, to, form, the, first, cities, it, is, also, thought, that, these, civilizations, were, the, first, to, organize, the, irrigation, of, desert, environments, for, growing, food, growing, food, at, scale, allowed, people, to, specialize, in, other, roles, form, hierarchies, and, organize, themselves, in, new, ways, leading, to, the, birth, of, civilization, in, pre, industrial, society, rivers, were, a, source, of, transportation, and, abundant, resources, many, civilizations, depended, on, what, resources, were, local, to, them, to, survive, shipping, of, commodities, especially, the, floating, of, wood, on, rivers, to, transport, it, was, especially, important, rivers, also, were, an, important, source, of, drinking, water, for, civilizations, built, around, rivers, fish, were, an, important, part, of, the, diet, of, humans, some, rivers, supported, fishing, activities, but, were, ill, suited, to, farming, such, as, those, in, the, pacific, northwest, other, animals, that, live, in, or, near, rivers, like, frogs, mussels, and, beavers, could, provide, food, and, valuable, goods, such, as, fur, humans, have, been, building, infrastructure, to, use, rivers, for, thousands, of, years, the, sadd, el, kafara, dam, near, cairo, egypt, is, an, ancient, dam, built, on, the, nile, 4, 500, years, ago, the, ancient, roman, civilization, used, aqueducts, to, transport, water, to, urban, areas, spanish, muslims, used, mills, and, water, wheels, beginning, in, the, seventh, century, between, 130, and, 1492, larger, dams, were, built, in, japan, afghanistan, and, india, including, 20, dams, higher, than, 15, meters, 49, ft, canals, began, to, be, cut, in, egypt, as, early, as, 3000, bc, and, the, mechanical, shadoof, began, to, be, used, to, raise, the, elevation, of, water, drought, years, harmed, crop, yields, and, leaders, of, society, were, incentivized, to, ensure, regular, water, and, food, availability, to, remain, in, power, engineering, projects, like, the, shadoof, and, canals, could, help, prevent, these, crises, despite, this, there, is, evidence, that, floodplain, based, civilizations, may, have, been, abandoned, occasionally, at, a, large, scale, this, has, been, attributed, to, unusually, large, floods, destroying, infrastructure, however, there, is, evidence, that, permanent, changes, to, climate, causing, higher, aridity, and, lower, river, flow, may, have, been, the, determining, factor, in, what, river, civilizations, succeeded, or, dissolved, water, wheels, began, to, be, used, at, least, 2, 000, years, ago, to, harness, the, energy, of, rivers, water, wheels, turn, an, axle, that, can, supply, rotational, energy, to, move, water, into, aqueducts, work, metal, using, a, trip, hammer, and, grind, grains, with, a, millstone, in, the, middle, ages, water, mills, began, to, automate, many, aspects, of, manual, labor, and, spread, rapidly, by, 1300, there, were, at, least, 10, 000, mills, in, england, alone, a, medieval, watermill, could, do, the, work, of, 30, 60, human, workers, water, mills, were, often, used, in, conjunction, with, dams, to, focus, and, increase, the, speed, of, the, water, water, wheels, continued, to, be, used, up, to, and, through, the, industrial, revolution, as, a, source, of, power, for, textile, mills, and, other, factories, but, were, eventually, supplanted, by, steam, power, rivers, became, more, industrialized, with, the, growth, of, technology, and, the, human, population, as, fish, and, water, could, be, brought, from, elsewhere, and, goods, and, people, could, be, transported, via, railways, pre, industrial, river, uses, diminished, in, favor, of, more, complex, uses, this, meant, that, the, local, ecosystems, of, rivers, needed, less, protection, as, humans, became, less, reliant, on, them, for, their, continued, flourishing, river, engineering, began, to, develop, projects, that, enabled, industrial, hydropower, canals, for, the, more, efficient, movement, of, goods, as, well, as, projects, for, flood, prevention, river, transportation, has, historically, been, significantly, cheaper, and, faster, than, transportation, by, land, rivers, helped, fuel, urbanization, as, goods, such, as, grain, and, fuel, could, be, floated, downriver, to, supply, cities, with, resources, river, transportation, is, also, important, for, the, lumber, industry, as, logs, can, be, shipped, via, river, countries, with, dense, forests, and, networks, of, rivers, like, sweden, have, historically, benefited, the, most, from, this, method, of, trade, the, rise, of, highways, and, the, automobile, has, made, this, practice, less, common, one, of, the, first, large, canals, was, the, canal, du, midi, connecting, rivers, within, france, to, create, a, path, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, mediterranean, sea, the, nineteenth, century, saw, canal, building, become, more, common, with, the, u, s, building, 4, 400, miles, 7, 100, km, of, canals, by, 1830, rivers, began, to, be, used, by, cargo, ships, at, a, larger, scale, and, these, canals, were, used, in, conjunction, with, river, engineering, projects, like, dredging, and, straightening, to, ensure, the, efficient, flow, of, goods, one, of, the, largest, such, projects, is, that, of, the, mississippi, river, whose, drainage, basin, covers, 40, of, the, contiguous, united, states, the, river, was, then, used, for, shipping, crops, from, the, american, midwest, and, cotton, from, the, american, south, to, other, states, as, well, as, the, atlantic, ocean, the, role, of, urban, rivers, has, evolved, from, when, they, were, a, center, of, trade, food, and, transportation, to, modern, times, when, these, uses, are, less, necessary, rivers, remain, central, to, the, cultural, identity, of, cities, and, nations, famous, examples, include, the, river, thames, s, relationship, to, london, the, seine, to, paris, and, the, hudson, river, to, new, york, city, the, restoration, of, water, quality, and, recreation, to, urban, rivers, has, been, a, goal, of, modern, administrations, for, example, swimming, was, banned, in, the, seine, for, over, 100, years, due, to, concerns, about, pollution, and, the, spread, of, e, coli, until, cleanup, efforts, to, allow, its, use, in, the, 2024, summer, olympics, another, example, is, the, restoration, of, the, isar, in, munich, from, being, a, fully, canalized, channel, with, hard, embankments, to, being, wider, with, naturally, sloped, banks, and, vegetation, this, has, improved, wildlife, habitat, in, the, isar, and, provided, more, opportunities, for, recreation, in, the, river, as, a, natural, barrier, rivers, are, often, used, as, a, border, between, countries, cities, and, other, territories, for, example, the, lamari, river, in, new, guinea, separates, the, angu, and, the, fore, people, in, new, guinea, the, two, cultures, speak, different, languages, and, rarely, mix, 23, of, international, borders, are, large, rivers, defined, as, those, over, 30, meters, wide, the, traditional, northern, border, of, the, roman, empire, was, the, danube, a, river, that, today, forms, the, border, of, hungary, and, slovakia, since, the, flow, of, a, river, is, rarely, static, the, exact, location, of, a, river, border, may, be, called, into, question, by, countries, the, rio, grande, between, the, united, states, and, mexico, is, regulated, by, the, international, boundary, and, water, commission, to, manage, the, right, to, fresh, water, from, the, river, as, well, as, mark, the, exact, location, of, the, border, up, to, 60, of, fresh, water, used, by, countries, comes, from, rivers, that, cross, international, borders, this, can, cause, disputes, between, countries, that, live, upstream, and, downstream, of, the, river, a, country, that, is, downstream, of, another, may, object, to, the, upstream, country, diverting, too, much, water, for, agricultural, uses, pollution, as, well, as, the, creation, of, dams, that, change, the, river, s, flow, characteristics, for, example, egypt, has, an, agreement, with, sudan, requiring, a, specific, minimum, volume, of, water, to, pass, into, the, nile, yearly, over, the, aswan, dam, to, maintain, both, countries, access, to, water, the, importance, of, rivers, throughout, human, history, has, given, them, an, association, with, life, and, fertility, they, have, also, become, associated, with, the, reverse, death, and, destruction, especially, through, floods, this, power, has, caused, rivers, to, have, a, central, role, in, religion, ritual, and, mythology, in, greek, mythology, the, underworld, is, bordered, by, several, rivers, ancient, greeks, believed, that, the, souls, of, those, who, perished, had, to, be, borne, across, the, river, styx, on, a, boat, by, charon, in, exchange, for, money, souls, that, were, judged, to, be, good, were, admitted, to, elysium, and, permitted, to, drink, water, from, the, river, lethe, to, forget, their, previous, life, rivers, also, appear, in, descriptions, of, paradise, in, abrahamic, religions, beginning, with, the, story, of, genesis, a, river, beginning, in, the, garden, of, eden, waters, the, garden, and, then, splits, into, four, rivers, that, flow, to, provide, water, to, the, world, these, rivers, include, the, tigris, and, euphrates, and, two, rivers, that, are, possibly, apocryphal, but, may, refer, to, the, nile, and, the, ganges, the, quran, describes, these, four, rivers, as, flowing, with, water, milk, wine, and, honey, respectively, the, book, of, genesis, also, contains, a, story, of, a, great, flood, similar, myths, are, present, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, sumerian, mythology, and, in, other, cultures, in, genesis, the, flood, s, role, was, to, cleanse, earth, of, the, wrongdoing, of, humanity, the, act, of, water, working, to, cleanse, humans, in, a, ritualistic, sense, has, been, compared, to, the, christian, ritual, of, baptism, famously, the, baptism, of, jesus, in, the, jordan, river, floods, also, appear, in, norse, mythology, where, the, world, is, said, to, emerge, from, a, void, that, eleven, rivers, flowed, into, aboriginal, australian, religion, and, mesoamerican, mythology, also, have, stories, of, floods, some, of, which, contain, no, survivors, unlike, the, abrahamic, flood, along, with, mythological, rivers, religions, have, also, cared, for, specific, rivers, as, sacred, rivers, the, ancient, celtic, religion, saw, rivers, as, goddesses, the, nile, had, many, gods, attached, to, it, the, tears, of, the, goddess, isis, were, said, to, be, the, cause, of, the, river, s, yearly, flooding, itself, personified, by, the, goddess, hapi, many, african, religions, regard, certain, rivers, as, the, originator, of, life, in, yoruba, religion, yem, ja, rules, over, the, ogun, river, in, modern, day, nigeria, and, is, responsible, for, creating, all, children, and, fish, some, sacred, rivers, have, religious, prohibitions, attached, to, them, such, as, not, being, allowed, to, drink, from, them, or, ride, in, a, boat, along, certain, stretches, in, these, religions, such, as, that, of, the, altai, in, russia, the, river, is, considered, a, living, being, that, must, be, afforded, respect, rivers, are, some, of, the, most, sacred, places, in, hinduism, there, is, archeological, evidence, that, mass, ritual, bathing, in, rivers, at, least, 5, 000, years, ago, in, the, indus, river, valley, while, most, rivers, in, india, are, revered, the, ganges, is, most, sacred, the, river, has, a, central, role, in, various, hindu, myths, and, its, water, is, said, to, have, properties, of, healing, as, well, as, absolution, from, sins, hindus, believe, that, when, the, cremated, remains, of, a, person, is, released, into, the, ganges, their, soul, is, released, from, the, mortal, world, freshwater, fish, make, up, 40, of, the, world, s, fish, species, but, 20, of, these, species, are, known, to, have, gone, extinct, in, recent, years, human, uses, of, rivers, make, these, species, especially, vulnerable, dams, and, other, engineered, changes, to, rivers, can, block, the, migration, routes, of, fish, and, destroy, habitats, rivers, that, flow, freely, from, headwaters, to, the, sea, have, better, water, quality, and, also, retain, their, ability, to, transport, nutrient, rich, alluvium, and, other, organic, material, downstream, keeping, the, ecosystem, healthy, the, creation, of, a, lake, changes, the, habitat, of, that, portion, of, water, and, blocks, the, transportation, of, sediment, as, well, as, preventing, the, natural, meandering, of, the, river, dams, block, the, migration, of, fish, such, as, salmon, for, which, fish, ladder, and, other, bypass, systems, have, been, attempted, but, these, are, not, always, effective, pollution, from, factories, and, urban, areas, can, also, damage, water, quality, per, and, polyfluoroalkyl, substances, pfas, is, a, widely, used, chemical, that, breaks, down, at, a, slow, rate, it, has, been, found, in, the, bodies, of, humans, and, animals, worldwide, as, well, as, in, the, soil, with, potentially, negative, health, effects, research, into, how, to, remove, it, from, the, environment, and, how, harmful, exposure, is, is, ongoing, fertilizer, from, farms, can, lead, to, a, proliferation, of, algae, on, the, surface, of, rivers, and, oceans, which, prevents, oxygen, and, light, from, dissolving, into, water, making, it, impossible, for, underwater, life, to, survive, in, these, so, called, dead, zones, urban, rivers, are, typically, surrounded, by, impermeable, surfaces, like, stone, asphalt, and, concrete, cities, often, have, storm, drains, that, direct, this, water, to, rivers, this, can, cause, flooding, risk, as, large, amounts, of, water, are, directed, into, the, rivers, due, to, these, impermeable, surfaces, these, rivers, often, have, very, little, alluvium, carried, in, them, causing, more, erosion, once, the, river, exits, the, impermeable, area, it, has, historically, been, common, for, sewage, to, be, directed, directly, to, rivers, via, sewer, systems, without, being, treated, along, with, pollution, from, industry, this, has, resulted, in, a, loss, of, animal, and, plant, life, in, urban, rivers, as, well, as, the, spread, of, waterborne, diseases, such, as, cholera, in, modern, times, sewage, treatment, and, controls, on, pollution, from, factories, have, improved, the, water, quality, of, urban, rivers, climate, change, can, change, the, flooding, cycles, and, water, supply, available, to, rivers, floods, can, be, larger, and, more, destructive, than, expected, causing, damage, to, the, surrounding, areas, floods, can, also, wash, unhealthy, chemicals, and, sediment, into, rivers, droughts, can, be, deeper, and, longer, causing, rivers, to, run, dangerously, low, this, is, in, part, because, of, a, projected, loss, of, snowpack, in, mountains, meaning, that, melting, snow, can, t, replenish, rivers, during, warm, summer, months, leading, to, lower, water, levels, lower, level, rivers, also, have, warmer, temperatures, threatening, species, like, salmon, that, prefer, colder, upstream, temperatures, attempts, have, been, made, to, regulate, the, exploitation, of, rivers, to, preserve, their, ecological, functions, many, wetland, areas, have, become, protected, from, development, water, restrictions, can, prevent, the, complete, draining, of, rivers, limits, on, the, construction, of, dams, as, well, as, dam, removal, can, restore, the, natural, habitats, of, river, species, regulators, can, also, ensure, regular, releases, of, water, from, dams, to, keep, animal, habitats, supplied, with, water, limits, on, pollutants, like, pesticides, can, help, improve, water, quality
