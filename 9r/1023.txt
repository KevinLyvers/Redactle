radioactive, decay, also, known, as, nuclear, decay, radioactivity, radioactive, disintegration, or, nuclear, disintegration, is, the, process, by, which, an, unstable, atomic, nucleus, loses, energy, by, radiation, a, material, containing, unstable, nuclei, is, considered, radioactive, three, of, the, most, common, types, of, decay, are, alpha, beta, and, gamma, decay, the, weak, force, is, the, mechanism, that, is, responsible, for, beta, decay, while, the, other, two, are, governed, by, the, electromagnetism, and, nuclear, force, radioactive, decay, is, a, random, process, at, the, level, of, single, atoms, according, to, quantum, theory, it, is, impossible, to, predict, when, a, particular, atom, will, decay, regardless, of, how, long, the, atom, has, existed, however, for, a, significant, number, of, identical, atoms, the, overall, decay, rate, can, be, expressed, as, a, decay, constant, or, as, half, life, the, half, lives, of, radioactive, atoms, have, a, huge, range, from, nearly, instantaneous, to, far, longer, than, the, age, of, the, universe, the, decaying, nucleus, is, called, the, parent, radionuclide, or, parent, radioisotope, and, the, process, produces, at, least, one, daughter, nuclide, except, for, gamma, decay, or, internal, conversion, from, a, nuclear, excited, state, the, decay, is, a, nuclear, transmutation, resulting, in, a, daughter, containing, a, different, number, of, protons, or, neutrons, or, both, when, the, number, of, protons, changes, an, atom, of, a, different, chemical, element, is, created, there, are, 28, naturally, occurring, chemical, elements, on, earth, that, are, radioactive, consisting, of, 35, radionuclides, seven, elements, have, two, different, radionuclides, that, date, before, the, time, of, formation, of, the, solar, system, these, 35, are, known, as, primordial, radionuclides, well, known, examples, are, uranium, and, thorium, but, also, included, are, naturally, occurring, long, lived, radioisotopes, such, as, potassium, 40, radioactivity, was, discovered, in, 1896, by, scientists, henri, becquerel, and, marie, curie, while, working, with, phosphorescent, materials, these, materials, glow, in, the, dark, after, exposure, to, light, and, becquerel, suspected, that, the, glow, produced, in, cathode, ray, tubes, by, x, rays, might, be, associated, with, phosphorescence, he, wrapped, a, photographic, plate, in, black, paper, and, placed, various, phosphorescent, salts, on, it, all, results, were, negative, until, he, used, uranium, salts, the, uranium, salts, caused, a, blackening, of, the, plate, in, spite, of, the, plate, being, wrapped, in, black, paper, these, radiations, were, given, the, name, becquerel, rays, it, soon, became, clear, that, the, blackening, of, the, plate, had, nothing, to, do, with, phosphorescence, as, the, blackening, was, also, produced, by, non, phosphorescent, salts, of, uranium, and, by, metallic, uranium, it, became, clear, from, these, experiments, that, there, was, a, form, of, invisible, radiation, that, could, pass, through, paper, and, was, causing, the, plate, to, react, as, if, exposed, to, light, at, first, it, seemed, as, though, the, new, radiation, was, similar, to, the, then, recently, discovered, x, rays, further, research, by, becquerel, ernest, rutherford, paul, villard, pierre, curie, marie, curie, and, others, showed, that, this, form, of, radioactivity, was, significantly, more, complicated, rutherford, was, the, first, to, realize, that, all, such, elements, decay, in, accordance, with, the, same, mathematical, exponential, formula, rutherford, and, his, student, frederick, soddy, were, the, first, to, realize, that, many, decay, processes, resulted, in, the, transmutation, of, one, element, to, another, subsequently, the, radioactive, displacement, law, of, fajans, and, soddy, was, formulated, to, describe, the, products, of, alpha, and, beta, decay, the, early, researchers, also, discovered, that, many, other, chemical, elements, besides, uranium, have, radioactive, isotopes, a, systematic, search, for, the, total, radioactivity, in, uranium, ores, also, guided, pierre, and, marie, curie, to, isolate, two, new, elements, polonium, and, radium, except, for, the, radioactivity, of, radium, the, chemical, similarity, of, radium, to, barium, made, these, two, elements, difficult, to, distinguish, marie, and, pierre, curie, s, study, of, radioactivity, is, an, important, factor, in, science, and, medicine, after, their, research, on, becquerel, s, rays, led, them, to, the, discovery, of, both, radium, and, polonium, they, coined, the, term, radioactivity, to, define, the, emission, of, ionizing, radiation, by, some, heavy, elements, later, the, term, was, generalized, to, all, elements, their, research, on, the, penetrating, rays, in, uranium, and, the, discovery, of, radium, launched, an, era, of, using, radium, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, their, exploration, of, radium, could, be, seen, as, the, first, peaceful, use, of, nuclear, energy, and, the, start, of, modern, nuclear, medicine, the, dangers, of, ionizing, radiation, due, to, radioactivity, and, x, rays, were, not, immediately, recognized, the, discovery, of, x, rays, by, wilhelm, r, ntgen, in, 1895, led, to, widespread, experimentation, by, scientists, physicians, and, inventors, many, people, began, recounting, stories, of, burns, hair, loss, and, worse, in, technical, journals, as, early, as, 1896, in, february, of, that, year, professor, daniel, and, dr, dudley, of, vanderbilt, university, performed, an, experiment, involving, x, raying, dudley, s, head, that, resulted, in, his, hair, loss, a, report, by, dr, h, d, hawks, of, his, suffering, severe, hand, and, chest, burns, in, an, x, ray, demonstration, was, the, first, of, many, other, reports, in, electrical, review, other, experimenters, including, elihu, thomson, and, nikola, tesla, also, reported, burns, thomson, deliberately, exposed, a, finger, to, an, x, ray, tube, over, a, period, of, time, and, suffered, pain, swelling, and, blistering, other, effects, including, ultraviolet, rays, and, ozone, were, sometimes, blamed, for, the, damage, and, many, physicians, still, claimed, that, there, were, no, effects, from, x, ray, exposure, at, all, despite, this, there, were, some, early, systematic, hazard, investigations, and, as, early, as, 1902, william, herbert, rollins, wrote, almost, despairingly, that, his, warnings, about, the, dangers, involved, in, the, careless, use, of, x, rays, were, not, being, heeded, either, by, industry, or, by, his, colleagues, by, this, time, rollins, had, proved, that, x, rays, could, kill, experimental, animals, could, cause, a, pregnant, guinea, pig, to, abort, and, that, they, could, kill, a, foetus, he, also, stressed, that, animals, vary, in, susceptibility, to, the, external, action, of, x, light, and, warned, that, these, differences, be, considered, when, patients, were, treated, by, means, of, x, rays, however, the, biological, effects, of, radiation, due, to, radioactive, substances, were, less, easy, to, gauge, this, gave, the, opportunity, for, many, physicians, and, corporations, to, market, radioactive, substances, as, patent, medicines, examples, were, radium, enema, treatments, and, radium, containing, waters, to, be, drunk, as, tonics, marie, curie, protested, against, this, sort, of, treatment, warning, that, radium, is, dangerous, in, untrained, hands, curie, later, died, from, aplastic, anaemia, likely, caused, by, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, by, the, 1930s, after, a, number, of, cases, of, bone, necrosis, and, death, of, radium, treatment, enthusiasts, radium, containing, medicinal, products, had, been, largely, removed, from, the, market, radioactive, quackery, only, a, year, after, r, ntgen, s, discovery, of, x, rays, the, american, engineer, wolfram, fuchs, 1896, gave, what, is, probably, the, first, protection, advice, but, it, was, not, until, 1925, that, the, first, international, congress, of, radiology, icr, was, held, and, considered, establishing, international, protection, standards, the, effects, of, radiation, on, genes, including, the, effect, of, cancer, risk, were, recognized, much, later, in, 1927, hermann, joseph, muller, published, research, showing, genetic, effects, and, in, 1946, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, findings, the, second, icr, was, held, in, stockholm, in, 1928, and, proposed, the, adoption, of, the, r, ntgen, unit, and, the, international, x, ray, and, radium, protection, committee, ixrpc, was, formed, rolf, sievert, was, named, chairman, but, a, driving, force, was, george, kaye, of, the, british, national, physical, laboratory, the, committee, met, in, 1931, 1934, and, 1937, after, world, war, ii, the, increased, range, and, quantity, of, radioactive, substances, being, handled, as, a, result, of, military, and, civil, nuclear, programs, led, to, large, groups, of, occupational, workers, and, the, public, being, potentially, exposed, to, harmful, levels, of, ionising, radiation, this, was, considered, at, the, first, post, war, icr, convened, in, london, in, 1950, when, the, present, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, icrp, was, born, since, then, the, icrp, has, developed, the, present, international, system, of, radiation, protection, covering, all, aspects, of, radiation, hazards, in, 2020, hauptmann, and, another, 15, international, researchers, from, eight, nations, among, them, institutes, of, biostatistics, registry, research, centers, of, cancer, epidemiology, radiation, epidemiology, and, also, the, u, s, national, cancer, institute, nci, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, and, the, radiation, effects, research, foundation, of, hiroshima, studied, definitively, through, meta, analysis, the, damage, resulting, from, the, low, doses, that, have, afflicted, survivors, of, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, also, in, numerous, accidents, at, nuclear, plants, that, have, occurred, these, scientists, reported, in, jnci, monographs, epidemiological, studies, of, low, dose, ionizing, radiation, and, cancer, risk, that, the, new, epidemiological, studies, directly, support, excess, cancer, risks, from, low, dose, ionizing, radiation, in, 2021, italian, researcher, sebastiano, venturi, reported, the, first, correlations, between, radio, caesium, and, pancreatic, cancer, with, the, role, of, caesium, in, biology, in, pancreatitis, and, in, diabetes, of, pancreatic, origin, the, international, system, of, units, si, unit, of, radioactive, activity, is, the, becquerel, bq, named, in, honor, of, the, scientist, henri, becquerel, one, bq, is, defined, as, one, transformation, or, decay, or, disintegration, per, second, an, older, unit, of, radioactivity, is, the, curie, ci, which, was, originally, defined, as, the, quantity, or, mass, of, radium, emanation, in, equilibrium, with, one, gram, of, radium, element, today, the, curie, is, defined, as, 3, 7, 10, 10, disintegrations, per, second, so, that, 1, curie, ci, 3, 7, 10, 10, bq, for, radiological, protection, purposes, although, the, united, states, nuclear, regulatory, commission, permits, the, use, of, the, unit, curie, alongside, si, units, the, european, union, european, units, of, measurement, directives, required, that, its, use, for, public, health, purposes, be, phased, out, by, 31, december, 1985, the, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, are, often, measured, in, units, of, gray, for, mechanical, or, sievert, for, damage, to, tissue, radioactive, decay, results, in, a, reduction, of, summed, rest, mass, once, the, released, energy, the, disintegration, energy, has, escaped, in, some, way, although, decay, energy, is, sometimes, defined, as, associated, with, the, difference, between, the, mass, of, the, parent, nuclide, products, and, the, mass, of, the, decay, products, this, is, true, only, of, rest, mass, measurements, where, some, energy, has, been, removed, from, the, product, system, this, is, true, because, the, decay, energy, must, always, carry, mass, with, it, wherever, it, appears, see, mass, in, special, relativity, according, to, the, formula, e, mc, 2, the, decay, energy, is, initially, released, as, the, energy, of, emitted, photons, plus, the, kinetic, energy, of, massive, emitted, particles, that, is, particles, that, have, rest, mass, if, these, particles, come, to, thermal, equilibrium, with, their, surroundings, and, photons, are, absorbed, then, the, decay, energy, is, transformed, to, thermal, energy, which, retains, its, mass, decay, energy, therefore, remains, associated, with, a, certain, measure, of, the, mass, of, the, decay, system, called, invariant, mass, which, does, not, change, during, the, decay, even, though, the, energy, of, decay, is, distributed, among, decay, particles, the, energy, of, photons, the, kinetic, energy, of, emitted, particles, and, later, the, thermal, energy, of, the, surrounding, matter, all, contribute, to, the, invariant, mass, of, the, system, thus, while, the, sum, of, the, rest, masses, of, the, particles, is, not, conserved, in, radioactive, decay, the, system, mass, and, system, invariant, mass, and, also, the, system, total, energy, is, conserved, throughout, any, decay, process, this, is, a, restatement, of, the, equivalent, laws, of, conservation, of, energy, and, conservation, of, mass, early, researchers, found, that, an, electric, or, magnetic, field, could, split, radioactive, emissions, into, three, types, of, beams, the, rays, were, given, the, names, alpha, beta, and, gamma, in, increasing, order, of, their, ability, to, penetrate, matter, alpha, decay, is, observed, only, in, heavier, elements, of, atomic, number, 52, tellurium, and, greater, with, the, exception, of, beryllium, 8, which, decays, to, two, alpha, particles, the, other, two, types, of, decay, are, observed, in, all, the, elements, lead, atomic, number, 82, is, the, heaviest, element, to, have, any, isotopes, stable, to, the, limit, of, measurement, to, radioactive, decay, radioactive, decay, is, seen, in, all, isotopes, of, all, elements, of, atomic, number, 83, bismuth, or, greater, bismuth, 209, however, is, only, very, slightly, radioactive, with, a, half, life, greater, than, the, age, of, the, universe, radioisotopes, with, extremely, long, half, lives, are, considered, effectively, stable, for, practical, purposes, in, analyzing, the, nature, of, the, decay, products, it, was, obvious, from, the, direction, of, the, electromagnetic, forces, applied, to, the, radiations, by, external, magnetic, and, electric, fields, that, alpha, particles, carried, a, positive, charge, beta, particles, carried, a, negative, charge, and, gamma, rays, were, neutral, from, the, magnitude, of, deflection, it, was, clear, that, alpha, particles, were, much, more, massive, than, beta, particles, passing, alpha, particles, through, a, very, thin, glass, window, and, trapping, them, in, a, discharge, tube, allowed, researchers, to, study, the, emission, spectrum, of, the, captured, particles, and, ultimately, proved, that, alpha, particles, are, helium, nuclei, other, experiments, showed, beta, radiation, resulting, from, decay, and, cathode, rays, were, high, speed, electrons, likewise, gamma, radiation, and, x, rays, were, found, to, be, high, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, the, relationship, between, the, types, of, decays, also, began, to, be, examined, for, example, gamma, decay, was, almost, always, found, to, be, associated, with, other, types, of, decay, and, occurred, at, about, the, same, time, or, afterwards, gamma, decay, as, a, separate, phenomenon, with, its, own, half, life, now, termed, isomeric, transition, was, found, in, natural, radioactivity, to, be, a, result, of, the, gamma, decay, of, excited, metastable, nuclear, isomers, which, were, in, turn, created, from, other, types, of, decay, although, alpha, beta, and, gamma, radiations, were, most, commonly, found, other, types, of, emission, were, eventually, discovered, shortly, after, the, discovery, of, the, positron, in, cosmic, ray, products, it, was, realized, that, the, same, process, that, operates, in, classical, beta, decay, can, also, produce, positrons, positron, emission, along, with, neutrinos, classical, beta, decay, produces, antineutrinos, in, electron, capture, some, proton, rich, nuclides, were, found, to, capture, their, own, atomic, electrons, instead, of, emitting, positrons, and, subsequently, these, nuclides, emit, only, a, neutrino, and, a, gamma, ray, from, the, excited, nucleus, and, often, also, auger, electrons, and, characteristic, x, rays, as, a, result, of, the, re, ordering, of, electrons, to, fill, the, place, of, the, missing, captured, electron, these, types, of, decay, involve, the, nuclear, capture, of, electrons, or, emission, of, electrons, or, positrons, and, thus, acts, to, move, a, nucleus, toward, the, ratio, of, neutrons, to, protons, that, has, the, least, energy, for, a, given, total, number, of, nucleons, this, consequently, produces, a, more, stable, lower, energy, nucleus, a, hypothetical, process, of, positron, capture, analogous, to, electron, capture, is, theoretically, possible, in, antimatter, atoms, but, has, not, been, observed, as, complex, antimatter, atoms, beyond, antihelium, are, not, experimentally, available, such, a, decay, would, require, antimatter, atoms, at, least, as, complex, as, beryllium, 7, which, is, the, lightest, known, isotope, of, normal, matter, to, undergo, decay, by, electron, capture, shortly, after, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, in, 1932, enrico, fermi, realized, that, certain, rare, beta, decay, reactions, immediately, yield, neutrons, as, an, additional, decay, particle, so, called, beta, delayed, neutron, emission, neutron, emission, usually, happens, from, nuclei, that, are, in, an, excited, state, such, as, the, excited, 17, o, produced, from, the, beta, decay, of, 17, n, the, neutron, emission, process, itself, is, controlled, by, the, nuclear, force, and, therefore, is, extremely, fast, sometimes, referred, to, as, nearly, instantaneous, isolated, proton, emission, was, eventually, observed, in, some, elements, it, was, also, found, that, some, heavy, elements, may, undergo, spontaneous, fission, into, products, that, vary, in, composition, in, a, phenomenon, called, cluster, decay, specific, combinations, of, neutrons, and, protons, other, than, alpha, particles, helium, nuclei, were, found, to, be, spontaneously, emitted, from, atoms, other, types, of, radioactive, decay, were, found, to, emit, previously, seen, particles, but, via, different, mechanisms, an, example, is, internal, conversion, which, results, in, an, initial, electron, emission, and, then, often, further, characteristic, x, rays, and, auger, electrons, emissions, although, the, internal, conversion, process, involves, neither, beta, nor, gamma, decay, a, neutrino, is, not, emitted, and, none, of, the, electron, s, and, photon, s, emitted, originate, in, the, nucleus, even, though, the, energy, to, emit, all, of, them, does, originate, there, internal, conversion, decay, like, isomeric, transition, gamma, decay, and, neutron, emission, involves, the, release, of, energy, by, an, excited, nuclide, without, the, transmutation, of, one, element, into, another, rare, events, that, involve, a, combination, of, two, beta, decay, type, events, happening, simultaneously, are, known, see, below, any, decay, process, that, does, not, violate, the, conservation, of, energy, or, momentum, laws, and, perhaps, other, particle, conservation, laws, is, permitted, to, happen, although, not, all, have, been, detected, an, interesting, example, discussed, in, a, final, section, is, bound, state, beta, decay, of, rhenium, 187, in, this, process, the, beta, electron, decay, of, the, parent, nuclide, is, not, accompanied, by, beta, electron, emission, because, the, beta, particle, has, been, captured, into, the, k, shell, of, the, emitting, atom, an, antineutrino, is, emitted, as, in, all, negative, beta, decays, if, energy, circumstances, are, favorable, a, given, radionuclide, may, undergo, many, competing, types, of, decay, with, some, atoms, decaying, by, one, route, and, others, decaying, by, another, an, example, is, copper, 64, which, has, 29, protons, and, 35, neutrons, which, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 12, 7004, 13, hours, this, isotope, has, one, unpaired, proton, and, one, unpaired, neutron, so, either, the, proton, or, the, neutron, can, decay, to, the, other, particle, which, has, opposite, isospin, this, particular, nuclide, though, not, all, nuclides, in, this, situation, is, more, likely, to, decay, through, beta, plus, decay, 61, 52, 26, than, through, electron, capture, 38, 48, 26, the, excited, energy, states, resulting, from, these, decays, which, fail, to, end, in, a, ground, energy, state, also, produce, later, internal, conversion, and, gamma, decay, in, almost, 0, 5, of, the, time, the, daughter, nuclide, of, a, decay, event, may, also, be, unstable, radioactive, in, this, case, it, too, will, decay, producing, radiation, the, resulting, second, daughter, nuclide, may, also, be, radioactive, this, can, lead, to, a, sequence, of, several, decay, events, called, a, decay, chain, see, this, article, for, specific, details, of, important, natural, decay, chains, eventually, a, stable, nuclide, is, produced, any, decay, daughters, that, are, the, result, of, an, alpha, decay, will, also, result, in, helium, atoms, being, created, some, radionuclides, may, have, several, different, paths, of, decay, for, example, 35, 94, 6, of, bismuth, 212, decays, through, alpha, emission, to, thallium, 208, while, 64, 06, 6, of, bismuth, 212, decays, through, beta, emission, to, polonium, 212, both, thallium, 208, and, polonium, 212, are, radioactive, daughter, products, of, bismuth, 212, and, both, decay, directly, to, stable, lead, 208, according, to, the, big, bang, theory, stable, isotopes, of, the, lightest, three, elements, h, he, and, traces, of, li, were, produced, very, shortly, after, the, emergence, of, the, universe, in, a, process, called, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, these, lightest, stable, nuclides, including, deuterium, survive, to, today, but, any, radioactive, isotopes, of, the, light, elements, produced, in, the, big, bang, such, as, tritium, have, long, since, decayed, isotopes, of, elements, heavier, than, boron, were, not, produced, at, all, in, the, big, bang, and, these, first, five, elements, do, not, have, any, long, lived, radioisotopes, thus, all, radioactive, nuclei, are, therefore, relatively, young, with, respect, to, the, birth, of, the, universe, having, formed, later, in, various, other, types, of, nucleosynthesis, in, stars, in, particular, supernovae, and, also, during, ongoing, interactions, between, stable, isotopes, and, energetic, particles, for, example, carbon, 14, a, radioactive, nuclide, with, a, half, life, of, only, 5700, 30, years, is, constantly, produced, in, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, due, to, interactions, between, cosmic, rays, and, nitrogen, nuclides, that, are, produced, by, radioactive, decay, are, called, radiogenic, nuclides, whether, they, themselves, are, stable, or, not, there, exist, stable, radiogenic, nuclides, that, were, formed, from, short, lived, extinct, radionuclides, in, the, early, solar, system, the, extra, presence, of, these, stable, radiogenic, nuclides, such, as, xenon, 129, from, extinct, iodine, 129, against, the, background, of, primordial, stable, nuclides, can, be, inferred, by, various, means, radioactive, decay, has, been, put, to, use, in, the, technique, of, radioisotopic, labeling, which, is, used, to, track, the, passage, of, a, chemical, substance, through, a, complex, system, such, as, a, living, organism, a, sample, of, the, substance, is, synthesized, with, a, high, concentration, of, unstable, atoms, the, presence, of, the, substance, in, one, or, another, part, of, the, system, is, determined, by, detecting, the, locations, of, decay, events, on, the, premise, that, radioactive, decay, is, truly, random, rather, than, merely, chaotic, it, has, been, used, in, hardware, random, number, generators, because, the, process, is, not, thought, to, vary, significantly, in, mechanism, over, time, it, is, also, a, valuable, tool, in, estimating, the, absolute, ages, of, certain, materials, for, geological, materials, the, radioisotopes, and, some, of, their, decay, products, become, trapped, when, a, rock, solidifies, and, can, then, later, be, used, subject, to, many, well, known, qualifications, to, estimate, the, date, of, the, solidification, these, include, checking, the, results, of, several, simultaneous, processes, and, their, products, against, each, other, within, the, same, sample, in, a, similar, fashion, and, also, subject, to, qualification, the, rate, of, formation, of, carbon, 14, in, various, eras, the, date, of, formation, of, organic, matter, within, a, certain, period, related, to, the, isotope, s, half, life, may, be, estimated, because, the, carbon, 14, becomes, trapped, when, the, organic, matter, grows, and, incorporates, the, new, carbon, 14, from, the, air, thereafter, the, amount, of, carbon, 14, in, organic, matter, decreases, according, to, decay, processes, that, may, also, be, independently, cross, checked, by, other, means, such, as, checking, the, carbon, 14, in, individual, tree, rings, for, example, the, szilard, chalmers, effect, is, the, breaking, of, a, chemical, bond, as, a, result, of, a, kinetic, energy, imparted, from, radioactive, decay, it, operates, by, the, absorption, of, neutrons, by, an, atom, and, subsequent, emission, of, gamma, rays, often, with, significant, amounts, of, kinetic, energy, this, kinetic, energy, by, newton, s, third, law, pushes, back, on, the, decaying, atom, which, causes, it, to, move, with, enough, speed, to, break, a, chemical, bond, this, effect, can, be, used, to, separate, isotopes, by, chemical, means, the, szilard, chalmers, effect, was, discovered, in, 1934, by, le, szil, rd, and, thomas, a, chalmers, they, observed, that, after, bombardment, by, neutrons, the, breaking, of, a, bond, in, liquid, ethyl, iodide, allowed, radioactive, iodine, to, be, removed, radioactive, primordial, nuclides, found, in, the, earth, are, residues, from, ancient, supernova, explosions, that, occurred, before, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, they, are, the, fraction, of, radionuclides, that, survived, from, that, time, through, the, formation, of, the, primordial, solar, nebula, through, planet, accretion, and, up, to, the, present, time, the, naturally, occurring, short, lived, radiogenic, radionuclides, found, in, today, s, rocks, are, the, daughters, of, those, radioactive, primordial, nuclides, another, minor, source, of, naturally, occurring, radioactive, nuclides, are, cosmogenic, nuclides, that, are, formed, by, cosmic, ray, bombardment, of, material, in, the, earth,

activity, of, a, radioactive, substance, is, characterized, by, the, following, time, independent, parameters, although, these, are, constants, they, are, associated, with, the, statistical, behavior, of, populations, of, atoms, in, consequence, predictions, using, these, constants, are, less, accurate, for, minuscule, samples, of, atoms, in, principle, a, half, life, a, third, life, or, even, a, 1, 2, life, can, be, used, in, exactly, the, same, way, as, half, life, but, the, mean, life, and, half, life, t, 1, 2, have, been, adopted, as, standard, times, associated, with, exponential, decay, those, parameters, can, be, related, to, the, following, time, dependent, parameters, these, are, related, as, follows, where, n, 0, is, the, initial, amount, of, active, substance, substance, that, has, the, same, percentage, of, unstable, particles, as, when, the, substance, was, formed, the, mathematics, of, radioactive, decay, depend, on, a, key, assumption, that, a, nucleus, of, a, radionuclide, has, no, memory, or, way, of, translating, its, history, into, its, present, behavior, a, nucleus, does, not, age, with, the, passage, of, time, thus, the, probability, of, its, breaking, down, does, not, increase, with, time, but, stays, constant, no, matter, how, long, the, nucleus, has, existed, this, constant, probability, may, differ, greatly, between, one, type, of, nucleus, and, another, leading, to, the, many, different, observed, decay, rates, however, whatever, the, probability, is, it, does, not, change, over, time, this, is, in, marked, contrast, to, complex, objects, that, do, show, aging, such, as, automobiles, and, humans, these, aging, systems, do, have, a, chance, of, breakdown, per, unit, of, time, that, increases, from, the, moment, they, begin, their, existence, aggregate, processes, like, the, radioactive, decay, of, a, lump, of, atoms, for, which, the, single, event, probability, of, realization, is, very, small, but, in, which, the, number, of, time, slices, is, so, large, that, there, is, nevertheless, a, reasonable, rate, of, events, are, modelled, by, the, poisson, distribution, which, is, discrete, radioactive, decay, and, nuclear, particle, reactions, are, two, examples, of, such, aggregate, processes, the, mathematics, of, poisson, processes, reduce, to, the, law, of, exponential, decay, which, describes, the, statistical, behaviour, of, a, large, number, of, nuclei, rather, than, one, individual, nucleus, in, the, following, formalism, the, number, of, nuclei, or, the, nuclei, population, n, is, of, course, a, discrete, variable, a, natural, number, but, for, any, physical, sample, n, is, so, large, that, it, can, be, treated, as, a, continuous, variable, differential, calculus, is, used, to, model, the, behaviour, of, nuclear, decay, consider, the, case, of, a, nuclide, a, that, decays, into, another, b, by, some, process, a, b, emission, of, other, particles, like, electron, neutrinos, e, and, electrons, e, as, in, beta, decay, are, irrelevant, in, what, follows, the, decay, of, an, unstable, nucleus, is, entirely, random, in, time, so, it, is, impossible, to, predict, when, a, particular, atom, will, decay, however, it, is, equally, likely, to, decay, at, any, instant, in, time, therefore, given, a, sample, of, a, particular, radioisotope, the, number, of, decay, events, d, n, expected, to, occur, in, a, small, interval, of, time, d, t, is, proportional, to, the, number, of, atoms, present, n, that, is, particular, radionuclides, decay, at, different, rates, so, each, has, its, own, decay, constant, the, expected, decay, d, n, n, is, proportional, to, an, increment, of, time, d, t, d, n, n, d, t, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, n, n, lambda, mathrm, d, t, the, negative, sign, indicates, that, n, decreases, as, time, increases, as, the, decay, events, follow, one, after, another, the, solution, to, this, first, order, differential, equation, is, the, function, where, n, 0, is, the, value, of, n, at, time, t, 0, with, the, decay, constant, expressed, as, we, have, for, all, time, t, where, n, total, is, the, constant, number, of, particles, throughout, the, decay, process, which, is, equal, to, the, initial, number, of, a, nuclides, since, this, is, the, initial, substance, if, the, number, of, non, decayed, a, nuclei, is, then, the, number, of, nuclei, of, b, i, e, the, number, of, decayed, a, nuclei, is, the, number, of, decays, observed, over, a, given, interval, obeys, poisson, statistics, if, the, average, number, of, decays, is, n, the, probability, of, a, given, number, of, decays, n, is, now, consider, the, case, of, a, chain, of, two, decays, one, nuclide, a, decaying, into, another, b, by, one, process, then, b, decaying, into, another, c, by, a, second, process, i, e, a, b, c, the, previous, equation, cannot, be, applied, to, the, decay, chain, but, can, be, generalized, as, follows, since, a, decays, into, b, then, b, decays, into, c, the, activity, of, a, adds, to, the, total, number, of, b, nuclides, in, the, present, sample, before, those, b, nuclides, decay, and, reduce, the, number, of, nuclides, leading, to, the, later, sample, in, other, words, the, number, of, second, generation, nuclei, b, increases, as, a, result, of, the, first, generation, nuclei, decay, of, a, and, decreases, as, a, result, of, its, own, decay, into, the, third, generation, nuclei, c, the, sum, of, these, two, terms, gives, the, law, for, a, decay, chain, for, two, nuclides, the, rate, of, change, of, n, b, that, is, d, n, b, d, t, is, related, to, the, changes, in, the, amounts, of, a, and, b, n, b, can, increase, as, b, is, produced, from, a, and, decrease, as, b, produces, c, re, writing, using, the, previous, results, d, n, b, d, t, b, n, b, a, n, a, 0, e, a, t, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, n, b, mathrm, d, t, lambda, b, n, b, lambda, a, n, a0, e, lambda, a, t, the, subscripts, simply, refer, to, the, respective, nuclides, i, e, n, a, is, the, number, of, nuclides, of, type, a, n, a, 0, is, the, initial, number, of, nuclides, of, type, a, a, is, the, decay, constant, for, a, and, similarly, for, nuclide, b, solving, this, equation, for, n, b, gives, in, the, case, where, b, is, a, stable, nuclide, b, 0, this, equation, reduces, to, the, previous, solution, as, shown, above, for, one, decay, the, solution, can, be, found, by, the, integration, factor, method, where, the, integrating, factor, is, e, b, t, this, case, is, perhaps, the, most, useful, since, it, can, derive, both, the, one, decay, equation, above, and, the, equation, for, multi, decay, chains, below, more, directly, for, the, general, case, of, any, number, of, consecutive, decays, in, a, decay, chain, i, e, a, 1, a, 2, a, i, a, d, where, d, is, the, number, of, decays, and, i, is, a, dummy, index, i, 1, 2, 3, d, each, nuclide, population, can, be, found, in, terms, of, the, previous, population, in, this, case, n, 2, 0, n, 3, 0, n, d, 0, using, the, above, result, in, a, recursive, form, the, general, solution, to, the, recursive, problem, is, given, by, bateman, s, equations, n, d, n, 1, 0, d,

can, decay, into, either, of, two, products, that, is, a, b, and, a, c, in, parallel, for, example, in, a, sample, of, potassium, 40, 89, 3, of, the, nuclei, decay, to, calcium, 40, and, 10, 7, to, argon, 40, we, have, for, all, time, t, which, is, constant, since, the, total, number, of, nuclides, remains, constant, differentiating, with, respect, to, time, defining, the, total, decay, constant, in, terms, of, the, sum, of, partial, decay, constants, b, and, c, solving, this, equation, for, n, a, where, n, a, 0, is, the, initial, number, of, nuclide, a, when, measuring, the, production, of, one, nuclide, one, can, only, observe, the, total, decay, constant, the, decay, constants, b, and, c, determine, the, probability, for, the, decay, to, result, in, products, b, or, c, as, follows, because, the, fraction, b, of, nuclei, decay, into, b, while, the, fraction, c, of, nuclei, decay, into, c, the, above, equations, can, also, be, written, using, quantities, related, to, the, number, of, nuclide, particles, n, in, a, sample, where, n, a, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, mol, 1, is, the, avogadro, constant, m, is, the, molar, mass, of, the, substance, in, kg, mol, and, the, amount, of, the, substance, n, is, in, moles, for, the, one, decay, solution, a, b, the, equation, indicates, that, the, decay, constant, has, units, of, t, 1, and, can, thus, also, be, represented, as, 1, where, is, a, characteristic, time, of, the, process, called, the, time, constant, in, a, radioactive, decay, process, this, time, constant, is, also, the, mean, lifetime, for, decaying, atoms, each, atom, lives, for, a, finite, amount, of, time, before, it, decays, and, it, may, be, shown, that, this, mean, lifetime, is, the, arithmetic, mean, of, all, the, atoms, lifetimes, and, that, it, is, which, again, is, related, to, the, decay, constant, as, follows, this, form, is, also, true, for, two, decay, processes, simultaneously, a, b, c, inserting, the, equivalent, values, of, decay, constants, as, given, above, into, the, decay, solution, leads, to, a, more, commonly, used, parameter, is, the, half, life, t, 1, 2, given, a, sample, of, a, particular, radionuclide, the, half, life, is, the, time, taken, for, half, the, radionuclide, s, atoms, to, decay, for, the, case, of, one, decay, nuclear, reactions, the, half, life, is, related, to, the, decay, constant, as, follows, set, n, n, 0, 2, and, t, t, 1, 2, to, obtain, this, relationship, between, the, half, life, and, the, decay, constant, shows, that, highly, radioactive, substances, are, quickly, spent, while, those, that, radiate, weakly, endure, longer, half, lives, of, known, radionuclides, vary, by, almost, 54, orders, of, magnitude, from, more, than, 2, 25, 9, 10, 24, years, 6, 9, 10, 31, sec, for, the, very, nearly, stable, nuclide, 128, te, to, 8, 6, 6, 10, 23, seconds, for, the, highly, unstable, nuclide, 5, h, the, factor, of, ln, 2, in, the, above, relations, results, from, the, fact, that, the, concept, of, half, life, is, merely, a, way, of, selecting, a, different, base, other, than, the, natural, base, e, for, the, lifetime, expression, the, time, constant, is, the, e, 1, life, the, time, until, only, 1, e, remains, about, 36, 8, rather, than, the, 50, in, the, half, life, of, a, radionuclide, thus, is, longer, than, t, 1, 2, the, following, equation, can, be, shown, to, be, valid, since, radioactive, decay, is, exponential, with, a, constant, probability, each, process, could, as, easily, be, described, with, a, different, constant, time, period, that, for, example, gave, its, 1, 3, life, how, long, until, only, 1, 3, is, left, or, 1, 10, life, a, time, period, until, only, 10, is, left, and, so, on, thus, the, choice, of, and, t, 1, 2, for, marker, times, are, only, for, convenience, and, from, convention, they, reflect, a, fundamental, principle, only, in, so, much, as, they, show, that, the, same, proportion, of, a, given, radioactive, substance, will, decay, during, any, time, period, that, one, chooses, mathematically, the, n, th, life, for, the, above, situation, would, be, found, in, the, same, way, as, above, by, setting, n, n, 0, n, t, t, 1, n, and, substituting, into, the, decay, solution, to, obtain, carbon, 14, has, a, half, life, of, 5700, 30, years, and, a, decay, rate, of, 14, disintegrations, per, minute, dpm, per, gram, of, natural, carbon, if, an, artifact, is, found, to, have, radioactivity, of, 4, dpm, per, gram, of, its, present, c, we, can, find, the, approximate, age, of, the, object, using, the, above, equation, where, the, radioactive, decay, modes, of, electron, capture, and, internal, conversion, are, known, to, be, slightly, sensitive, to, chemical, and, environmental, effects, that, change, the, electronic, structure, of, the, atom, which, in, turn, affects, the, presence, of, 1s, and, 2s, electrons, that, participate, in, the, decay, process, a, small, number, of, nuclides, are, affected, for, example, chemical, bonds, can, affect, the, rate, of, electron, capture, to, a, small, degree, in, general, less, than, 1, depending, on, the, proximity, of, electrons, to, the, nucleus, in, 7, be, a, difference, of, 0, 9, has, been, observed, between, half, lives, in, metallic, and, insulating, environments, this, relatively, large, effect, is, because, beryllium, is, a, small, atom, whose, valence, electrons, are, in, 2s, atomic, orbitals, which, are, subject, to, electron, capture, in, 7, be, because, like, all, s, atomic, orbitals, in, all, atoms, they, naturally, penetrate, into, the, nucleus, in, 1992, jung, et, al, of, the, darmstadt, heavy, ion, research, group, observed, an, accelerated, decay, of, 163, dy, 66, although, neutral, 163, dy, is, a, stable, isotope, the, fully, ionized, 163, dy, 66, undergoes, decay, into, the, k, and, l, shells, to, 163, ho, 66, with, a, half, life, of, 47, days, rhenium, 187, is, another, spectacular, example, 187, re, normally, undergoes, beta, decay, to, 187, os, with, a, half, life, of, 41, 6, 10, 9, years, but, studies, using, fully, ionised, 187, re, atoms, bare, nuclei, have, found, that, this, can, decrease, to, only, 32, 9, years, this, is, attributed, to, bound, state, decay, of, the, fully, ionised, atom, the, electron, is, emitted, into, the, k, shell, 1s, atomic, orbital, which, cannot, occur, for, neutral, atoms, in, which, all, low, lying, bound, states, are, occupied, a, number, of, experiments, have, found, that, decay, rates, of, other, modes, of, artificial, and, naturally, occurring, radioisotopes, are, to, a, high, degree, of, precision, unaffected, by, external, conditions, such, as, temperature, pressure, the, chemical, environment, and, electric, magnetic, or, gravitational, fields, comparison, of, laboratory, experiments, over, the, last, century, studies, of, the, oklo, natural, nuclear, reactor, which, exemplified, the, effects, of, thermal, neutrons, on, nuclear,

example, strongly, indicate, that, unperturbed, decay, rates, have, been, constant, at, least, to, within, the, limitations, of, small, experimental, errors, as, a, function, of, time, as, well, recent, results, suggest, the, possibility, that, decay, rates, might, have, a, weak, dependence, on, environmental, factors, it, has, been, suggested, that, measurements, of, decay, rates, of, silicon, 32, manganese, 54, and, radium, 226, exhibit, small, seasonal, variations, of, the, order, of, 0, 1, however, such, measurements, are, highly, susceptible, to, systematic, errors, and, a, subsequent, paper, has, found, no, evidence, for, such, correlations, in, seven, other, isotopes, 22, na, 44, ti, 108, ag, 121, sn, 133, ba, 241, am, 238, pu, and, sets, upper, limits, on, the, size,

solar, flare, activity, or, the, distance, from, the, sun, but, detailed, analysis, of, the, experiment, s, design, flaws, along, with, comparisons, to, other, much, more, stringent, and, systematically, controlled, experiments, refute, this, claim, an, unexpected, series, of, experimental, results, for, the, rate, of, decay, of, heavy, highly, charged, radioactive, ions, circulating, in, a, storage, ring, has, provoked, theoretical, activity, in, an, effort, to, find, a, convincing, explanation, the, rates, of, weak, decay, of, two, radioactive, species, with, half, lives, of, about, 40, s, and, 200, s, are, found, to, have, a, significant, oscillatory, modulation, with, a, period, of, about, 7, s, the, observed, phenomenon, is, known, as, the, gsi, anomaly, as, the, storage, ring, is, a, facility, at, the, gsi, helmholtz, centre, for, heavy, ion, research, in, darmstadt, germany, as, the, decay, process, produces, an, electron, neutrino, some, of, the, proposed, explanations, for, the, observed, rate, oscillation, invoke, neutrino, properties, initial, ideas, related, to, flavour, oscillation, met, with, skepticism, a, more, recent, proposal, involves, mass, differences, between, neutrino, mass, eigenstates, the, neutrons, and, protons, that, constitute, nuclei, as, well, as, other, particles, that, approach, close, enough, to, them, are, governed, by, several, interactions, the, nuclear, force, also, known, as, residual, strong, force, not, observed, at, the, familiar, macroscopic, scale, is, the, most, powerful, force, over, subatomic, distances, the, electrostatic, force, is, almost, always, significant, and, in, the, case, of, beta, decay, the, weak, nuclear, force, is, also, involved, the, combined, effects, of, these, forces, produces, a, number, of, different, phenomena, in, which, energy, may, be, released, by, rearrangement, of, particles, in, the, nucleus, or, else, the, change, of, one, type, of, particle, into, others, these, rearrangements, and, transformations, may, be, hindered, energetically, so, that, they, do, not, occur, immediately, radioactive, decay, half, life, of, nuclides, has, been, measured, over, timescales, of, 54, orders, of, magnitude, from, 8, 6, 6, 10, 23, seconds, for, hydrogen, 5, to, 7, 10, 28, 10, 31, seconds, for, tellurium, 128, the, limits, of, these, timescales, are, set, by, the, sensitivity, of, instrumentation, only, and, there, are, no, known, natural, limits, to, how, brief, or, long, a, decay, half, life, for, radioactive, decay, of, a, radionuclide, may, be, a, radioactive, nucleus, or, any, excited, system, in, quantum, mechanics, is, unstable, and, can, thus, spontaneously, stabilize, to, a, less, excited, system, the, resulting, transformation, alters, the, structure, of, the, nucleus, and, results, in, the, emission, of, either, a, photon, or, a, high, velocity, particle, that, has, mass, such, as, an, electron, alpha, particle, or, other, type,
