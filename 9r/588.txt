in, geology, rock, or, stone, is, any, naturally, occurring, solid, mass, or, aggregate, of, minerals, or, mineraloid, matter, it, is, categorized, by, the, minerals, included, its, chemical, composition, and, the, way, in, which, it, is, formed, rocks, form, the, earth, s, outer, solid, layer, the, crust, and, most, of, its, interior, except, for, the, liquid, outer, core, and, pockets, of, magma, in, the, asthenosphere, the, study, of, rocks, involves, multiple, subdisciplines, of, geology, including, petrology, and, mineralogy, it, may, be, limited, to, rocks, found, on, earth, or, it, may, include, planetary, geology, that, studies, the, rocks, of, other, celestial, objects, rocks, are, usually, grouped, into, three, main, groups, igneous, rocks, sedimentary, rocks, and, metamorphic, rocks, igneous, rocks, are, formed, when, magma, cools, in, the, earth, s, crust, or, lava, cools, on, the, ground, surface, or, the, seabed, sedimentary, rocks, are, formed, by, diagenesis, and, lithification, of, sediments, which, in, turn, are, formed, by, the, weathering, transport, and, deposition, of, existing, rocks, metamorphic, rocks, are, formed, when, existing, rocks, are, subjected, to, such, high, pressures, and, temperatures, that, they, are, transformed, without, significant, melting, humanity, has, made, use, of, rocks, since, the, earliest, humans, this, early, period, called, the, stone, age, saw, the, development, of, many, stone, tools, stone, was, then, used, as, a, major, component, in, the, construction, of, buildings, and, early, infrastructure, mining, developed, to, extract, rocks, from, the, earth, and, obtain, the, minerals, within, them, including, metals, modern, technology, has, allowed, the, development, of, new, human, made, rocks, and, rock, like, substances, such, as, concrete, geology, is, the, study, of, earth, and, its, components, including, the, study, of, rock, formations, petrology, is, the, study, of, the, character, and, origin, of, rocks, mineralogy, is, the, study, of, the, mineral, components, that, create, rocks, the, study, of, rocks, and, their, components, has, contributed, to, the, geological, understanding, of, earth, s, history, the, archaeological, understanding, of, human, history, and, the, development, of, engineering, and, technology, in, human, society, while, the, history, of, geology, includes, many, theories, of, rocks, and, their, origins, that, have, persisted, throughout, human, history, the, study, of, rocks, was, developed, as, a, formal, science, during, the, 19th, century, plutonism, was, developed, as, a, theory, during, this, time, and, the, discovery, of, radioactive, decay, in, 1896, allowed, for, the, radiocarbon, dating, of, rocks, understanding, of, plate, tectonics, developed, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, rocks, are, composed, primarily, of, grains, of, minerals, which, are, crystalline, solids, formed, from, atoms, chemically, bonded, into, an, orderly, structure, 3, some, rocks, also, contain, mineraloids, which, are, rigid, mineral, like, substances, such, as, volcanic, glass, 55, 79, that, lack, crystalline, structure, the, types, and, abundance, of, minerals, in, a, rock, are, determined, by, the, manner, in, which, it, was, formed, most, rocks, contain, silicate, minerals, compounds, that, include, silica, tetrahedra, in, their, crystal, lattice, and, account, for, about, one, third, of, all, known, mineral, species, and, about, 95, of, the, earth, s, crust, the, proportion, of, silica, in, rocks, and, minerals, is, a, major, factor, in, determining, their, names, and, properties, rocks, are, classified, according, to, characteristics, such, as, mineral, and, chemical, composition, permeability, texture, of, the, constituent, particles, and, particle, size, these, physical, properties, are, the, result, of, the, processes, that, formed, the, rocks, over, the, course, of, time, rocks, can, be, transformed, from, one, type, into, another, as, described, by, a, geological, model, called, the, rock, cycle, this, transformation, produces, three, general, classes, of, rock, igneous, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, those, three, classes, are, subdivided, into, many, groups, there, are, however, no, hard, and, fast, boundaries, between, allied, rocks, by, increase, or, decrease, in, the, proportions, of, their, minerals, they, pass, through, gradations, from, one, to, the, other, the, distinctive, structures, of, one, kind, of, rock, may, thus, be, traced, gradually, merging, into, those, of, another, hence, the, definitions, adopted, in, rock, names, simply, correspond, to, selected, points, in, a, continuously, graduated, series, igneous, rock, derived, from, the, latin, word, igneus, meaning, of, fire, from, ignis, meaning, fire, is, formed, through, the, cooling, and, solidification, of, magma, or, lava, this, magma, may, be, derived, from, partial, melts, of, pre, existing, rocks, in, either, a, planet, s, mantle, or, crust, typically, the, melting, of, rocks, is, caused, by, one, or, more, of, three, processes, an, increase, in, temperature, a, decrease, in, pressure, or, a, change, in, composition, 591, 599, igneous, rocks, are, divided, into, two, main, categories, magmas, tend, to, become, richer, in, silica, as, they, rise, towards, the, earth, s, surface, a, process, called, magma, differentiation, this, occurs, both, because, minerals, low, in, silica, crystallize, out, of, the, magma, as, it, begins, to, cool, bowen, s, reaction, series, and, because, the, magma, assimilates, some, of, the, crustal, rock, through, which, it, ascends, country, rock, and, crustal, rock, tends, to, be, high, in, silica, silica, content, is, thus, the, most, important, chemical, criterion, for, classifying, igneous, rock, the, content, of, alkali, metal, oxides, is, next, in, importance, about, 65, of, the, earth, s, crust, by, volume, consists, of, igneous, rocks, of, these, 66, are, basalt, and, gabbro, 16, are, granite, and, 17, granodiorite, and, diorite, only, 0, 6, are, syenite, and, 0, 3, are, ultramafic, the, oceanic, crust, is, 99, basalt, which, is, an, igneous, rock, of, mafic, composition, granite, and, similar, rocks, known, as, granitoids, dominate, the, continental, crust, sedimentary, rocks, are, formed, at, the, earth, s, surface, by, the, accumulation, and, cementation, of, fragments, of, earlier, rocks, minerals, and, organisms, or, as, chemical, precipitates, and, organic, growths, in, water, sedimentation, this, process, causes, clastic, sediments, pieces, of, rock, or, organic, particles, detritus, to, settle, and, accumulate, or, for, minerals, to, chemically, precipitate, evaporite, from, a, solution, the, particulate, matter, then, undergoes, compaction, and, cementation, at, moderate, temperatures, and, pressures, diagenesis, 265, 280, 147, 154, before, being, deposited, sediments, are, formed, by, weathering, of, earlier, rocks, by, erosion, in, a, source, area, and, then, transported, to, the, place, of, deposition, by, water, wind, ice, mass, movement, or, glaciers, agents, of, denudation, about, 7, 9, of, the, crust, by, volume, is, composed, of, sedimentary, rocks, with, 82, of, those, being, shales, while, the, remainder, consists, of, 6, limestone, and, 12, sandstone, and, arkoses, sedimentary, rocks, often, contain, fossils, sedimentary, rocks, form, under, the, influence, of, gravity, and, typically, are, deposited, in, horizontal, or, near, horizontal, layers, or, strata, and, may, be, referred, to, as, stratified, rocks, sediment, and, the, particles, of, clastic, sedimentary, rocks, can, be, further, classified, by, grain, size, the, smallest, sediments, are, clay, followed, by, silt, sand, and, gravel, some, systems, include, cobbles, and, boulders, as, measurements, metamorphic, rocks, are, formed, by, subjecting, any, rock, type, sedimentary, rock, igneous, rock, or, another, older, metamorphic, rock, to, different, temperature, and, pressure, conditions, than, those, in, which, the, original, rock, was, formed, this, process, is, called, metamorphism, meaning, to, change, in, form, the, result, is, a, profound, change, in, physical, properties, and, chemistry, of, the, stone, the, original, rock, known, as, the, protolith, transforms, into, other, mineral, types, or, other, forms, of, the, same, minerals, by, recrystallization, the, temperatures, and, pressures, required, for, this, process, are, always, higher, than, those, found, at, the, earth, s, surface, temperatures, greater, than, 150, to, 200, c, and, pressures, greater, than, 1500, bars, this, occurs, for, example, when, continental, plates, collide, 31, 33, 134, 139, metamorphic, rocks, compose, 27, 4, of, the, crust, by, volume, the, three, major, classes, of, metamorphic, rock, are, based, upon, the, formation, mechanism, an, intrusion, of, magma, that, heats, the, surrounding, rock, causes, contact, metamorphism, a, temperature, dominated, transformation, pressure, metamorphism, occurs, when, sediments, are, buried, deep, under, the, ground, pressure, is, dominant, and, temperature, plays, a, smaller, role, this, is, termed, burial, metamorphism, and, it, can, result, in, rocks, such, as, jade, where, both, heat, and, pressure, play, a, role, the, mechanism, is, termed, regional, metamorphism, this, is, typically, found, in, mountain, building, regions, depending, on, the, structure, metamorphic, rocks, are, divided, into, two, general, categories, those, that, possess, a, texture, are, referred, to, as, foliated, the, remainders, are, termed, non, foliated, the, name, of, the, rock, is, then, determined, based, on, the, types, of, minerals, present, schists, are, foliated, rocks, that, are, primarily, composed, of, lamellar, minerals, such, as, micas, a, gneiss, has, visible, bands, of, differing, lightness, with, a, common, example, being, the, granite, gneiss, other, varieties, of, foliated, rock, include, slates, phyllites, and, mylonite, familiar, examples, of, non, foliated, metamorphic, rocks, include, marble, soapstone, and, serpentine, this, branch, contains, quartzite, a, metamorphosed, form, of, sandstone, and, hornfels, though, most, understanding, of, rocks, comes, from, those, of, earth, rocks, make, up, many, of, the, universe, s, celestial, bodies, in, the, solar, system, mars, venus, and, mercury, are, composed, of, rock, as, are, many, natural, satellites, asteroids, and, meteoroids, meteorites, that, fall, to, earth, provide, evidence, of, extraterrestrial, rocks, and, their, composition, they, are, typically, heavier, than, rocks, on, earth, asteroid, rocks, can, also, be, brought, to, earth, through, space, missions, such, as, the, hayabusa, mission, lunar, rocks, and, martian, rocks, have, also, been, studied, the, use, of, rock, has, had, a, huge, impact, on, the, cultural, and, technological, development, of, the, human, race, rock, has, been, used, by, humans, and, other, hominids, for, at, least, 2, 5, million, years, lithic, technology, marks, some, of, the, oldest, and, continuously, used, technologies, the, mining, of, rock, for, its, metal, content, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, factors, of, human, advancement, and, has, progressed, at, different, rates, in, different, places, in, part, because, of, the, kind, of, metals, available, from, the, rock, of, a, region, anthropic, rock, is, synthetic, or, restructured, rock, formed, by, human, activity, concrete, is, recognized, as, a, human, made, rock, constituted, of, natural, and, processed, rock, and, having, been, developed, since, ancient, rome, rock, can, also, be, modified, with, other, substances, to, develop, new, forms, such, as, epoxy, granite, artificial, stone, has, also, been, developed, such, as, coade, stone, geologist, james, r, underwood, has, proposed, anthropic, rock, as, a, fourth, class, of, rocks, alongside, igneous, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, rock, varies, greatly, in, strength, from, quartzites, having, a, tensile, strength, in, excess, of, 300, mpa, to, sedimentary, rock, so, soft, it, can, be, crumbled, with, bare, fingers, that, is, it, is, friable, for, comparison, structural, steel, has, a, tensile, strength, of, around, 350, mpa, relatively, soft, easily, worked, sedimentary, rock, was, quarried, for, construction, as, early, as, 4000, bce, in, egypt, and, stone, was, used, to, build, fortifications, in, inner, mongolia, as, early, as, 2800, bce, the, soft, rock, tuff, is, common, in, italy, and, the, romans, used, it, for, many, buildings, and, bridges, limestone, was, widely, used, in, construction, in, the, middle, ages, in, europe, and, remained, popular, into, the, 20th, century, mining, is, the, extraction, of, valuable, minerals, or, other, geological, materials, from, the, earth, from, an, ore, body, vein, or, seam, the, term, also, includes, the, removal, of, soil, materials, recovered, by, mining, include, base, metals, precious, metals, iron, uranium, coal, diamonds, limestone, oil, shale, rock, salt, potash, construction, aggregate, and, dimension, stone, mining, is, required, to, obtain, any, material, that, cannot, be, grown, through, agricultural, processes, or, created, artificially, in, a, laboratory, or, factory, mining, in, a, wider, sense, comprises, extraction, of, any, resource, e, g, petroleum, natural, gas, salt, or, even, water, from, the, earth, mining, of, rock, and, metals, has, been, done, since, prehistoric, times, modern, mining, processes, involve, prospecting, for, mineral, deposits, analysis, of, the, profit, potential, of, a, proposed, mine, extraction, of, the, desired, materials, and, finally, reclamation, of, the, land, to, prepare, it, for, other, uses, once, mining, ceases, mining, processes, may, create, negative, impacts, on, the, environment, both, during, the, mining, operations, and, for, years, after, mining, has, ceased, these, potential, impacts, have, led, to, most, of, the, world, s, nations, adopting, regulations, to, manage, negative, effects, of, mining, operations, stone, tools, have, been, used, for, millions, of, years, by, humans, and, earlier, hominids, the, stone, age, was, a, period, of, widespread, stone, tool, usage, early, stone, age, tools, were, simple, implements, such, as, hammerstones, and, sharp, flakes, middle, stone, age, tools, featured, sharpened, points, to, be, used, as, projectile, points, awls, or, scrapers, late, stone, age, tools, were, developed, with, craftsmanship, and, distinct, cultural, identities, stone, tools, were, largely, superseded, by, copper, and, bronze, tools, following, the, development, of, metallurgy
