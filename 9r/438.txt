neptunium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, np, and, atomic, number, 93, a, radioactive, actinide, metal, neptunium, is, the, first, transuranic, element, it, is, named, after, neptune, the, planet, beyond, uranus, in, the, solar, system, which, uranium, is, named, after, a, neptunium, atom, has, 93, protons, and, 93, electrons, of, which, seven, are, valence, electrons, neptunium, metal, is, silvery, and, tarnishes, when, exposed, to, air, the, element, occurs, in, three, allotropic, forms, and, it, normally, exhibits, five, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 3, to, 7, like, all, actinides, it, is, radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and, capable, of, accumulating, in, bones, which, makes, the, handling, of, neptunium, dangerous, although, many, false, claims, of, its, discovery, were, made, over, the, years, the, element, was, first, synthesized, by, edwin, mcmillan, and, philip, h, abelson, at, the, berkeley, radiation, laboratory, in, 1940, since, then, most, neptunium, has, been, and, still, is, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, of, uranium, in, nuclear, reactors, the, vast, majority, is, generated, as, a, by, product, in, conventional, nuclear, power, reactors, while, neptunium, itself, has, no, commercial, uses, at, present, it, is, used, as, a, precursor, for, the, formation, of, plutonium, 238, which, is, in, turn, used, in, radioisotope, thermal, generators, to, provide, electricity, for, spacecraft, neptunium, has, also, been, used, in, detectors, of, high, energy, neutrons, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, neptunium, neptunium, 237, is, a, by, product, of, nuclear, reactors, and, plutonium, production, this, isotope, and, the, isotope, neptunium, 239, are, also, found, in, trace, amounts, in, uranium, ores, due, to, neutron, capture, reactions, and, beta, decay, neptunium, is, a, hard, silvery, ductile, radioactive, actinide, metal, in, the, periodic, table, it, is, located, to, the, right, of, the, actinide, uranium, to, the, left, of, the, actinide, plutonium, and, below, the, lanthanide, promethium, neptunium, is, a, hard, metal, having, a, bulk, modulus, of, 118, gpa, comparable, to, that, of, manganese, neptunium, metal, is, similar, to, uranium, in, terms, of, physical, workability, when, exposed, to, air, at, normal, temperatures, it, forms, a, thin, oxide, layer, this, reaction, proceeds, more, rapidly, as, the, temperature, increases, neptunium, melts, at, 639, 3, c, this, low, melting, point, a, property, the, metal, shares, with, the, neighboring, element, plutonium, which, has, melting, point, 639, 4, c, is, due, to, the, hybridization, of, the, 5f, and, 6d, orbitals, and, the, formation, of, directional, bonds, in, the, metal, the, boiling, point, of, neptunium, is, not, empirically, known, and, the, usually, given, value, of, 4174, c, is, extrapolated, from, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, element, if, accurate, this, would, give, neptunium, the, largest, liquid, range, of, any, element, 3535, k, passes, between, its, melting, and, boiling, points, neptunium, is, found, in, at, least, three, allotropes, some, claims, of, a, fourth, allotrope, have, been, made, but, they, are, so, far, not, proven, this, multiplicity, of, allotropes, is, common, among, the, actinides, the, crystal, structures, of, neptunium, protactinium, uranium, and, plutonium, do, not, have, clear, analogs, among, the, lanthanides, and, are, more, similar, to, those, of, the, 3d, transition, metals, neptunium, takes, on, an, orthorhombic, structure, resembling, a, highly, distorted, body, centered, cubic, structure, each, neptunium, atom, is, coordinated, to, four, others, and, the, np, np, bond, lengths, are, 260, pm, it, is, the, densest, of, all, the, actinides, and, the, fifth, densest, of, all, naturally, occurring, elements, behind, only, rhenium, platinum, iridium, and, osmium, neptunium, has, semimetallic, properties, such, as, strong, covalent, bonding, and, a, high, electrical, resistivity, and, its, metallic, physical, properties, are, closer, to, those, of, the, metalloids, than, the, true, metals, some, allotropes, of, the, other, actinides, also, exhibit, similar, behaviour, though, to, a, lesser, degree, the, densities, of, different, isotopes, of, neptunium, in, the, alpha, phase, are, expected, to, be, observably, different, 235, np, should, have, density, 20, 303, g, cm, 3, 236, np, density, 20, 389, g, cm, 3, 237, np, density, 20, 476, g, cm, 3, neptunium, takes, on, a, distorted, tetragonal, close, packed, structure, four, atoms, of, neptunium, make, up, a, unit, cell, and, the, np, np, bond, lengths, are, 276, pm, neptunium, has, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, and, has, np, np, bond, length, of, 297, pm, the, form, becomes, less, stable, with, increased, pressure, though, the, melting, point, of, neptunium, also, increases, with, pressure, the, np, np, liquid, triple, point, occurs, at, 725, c, and, 3200, mpa, due, to, the, presence, of, valence, 5f, electrons, neptunium, and, its, alloys, exhibit, a, very, interesting, magnetic, behavior, like, many, other, actinides, these, can, range, from, the, itinerant, band, like, character, characteristic, of, the, transition, metals, to, the, local, moment, behavior, typical, of, scandium, yttrium, and, the, lanthanides, this, stems, from, 5f, orbital, hybridization, with, the, orbitals, of, the, metal, ligands, and, the, fact, that, the, 5f, orbital, is, relativistically, destabilized, and, extends, outwards, for, example, pure, neptunium, is, paramagnetic, np, al, 3, is, ferromagnetic, np, ge, 3, has, no, magnetic, ordering, and, np, sn, 3, may, be, a, heavy, fermion, material, investigations, are, underway, regarding, alloys, of, neptunium, with, uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and, iron, so, as, to, recycle, long, lived, waste, isotopes, such, as, neptunium, 237, into, shorter, lived, isotopes, more, useful, as, nuclear, fuel, one, neptunium, based, superconductor, alloy, has, been, discovered, with, formula, np, pd, 5, al, 2, this, occurrence, in, neptunium, compounds, is, somewhat, surprising, because, they, often, exhibit, strong, magnetism, which, usually, destroys, superconductivity, the, alloy, has, a, tetragonal, structure, with, a, superconductivity, transition, temperature, of, 268, 3, c, 4, 9, k, neptunium, has, five, ionic, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 3, to, 7, when, forming, chemical, compounds, which, can, be, simultaneously, observed, in, solutions, it, is, the, heaviest, actinide, that, can, lose, all, its, valence, electrons, in, a, stable, compound, the, most, stable, state, in, solution, is, 5, but, the, valence, 4, is, preferred, in, solid, neptunium, compounds, neptunium, metal, is, very, reactive, ions, of, neptunium, are, prone, to, hydrolysis, and, formation, of, coordination, compounds, a, neptunium, atom, has, 93, electrons, arranged, in, the, configuration, 5f, 4, 6d, 1, 7s, 2, this, differs, from, the, configuration, expected, by, the, aufbau, principle, in, that, one, electron, is, in, the, 6d, subshell, instead, of, being, as, expected, in, the, 5f, subshell, this, is, because, of, the, similarity, of, the, electron, energies, of, the, 5f, 6d, and, 7s, subshells, in, forming, compounds, and, ions, all, the, valence, electrons, may, be, lost, leaving, behind, an, inert, core, of, inner, electrons, with, the, electron, configuration, of, the, noble, gas, radon, more, commonly, only, some, of, the, valence, electrons, will, be, lost, the, electron, configuration, for, the, tripositive, ion, np, 3, is, 5f, 4, with, the, outermost, 7s, and, 6d, electrons, lost, first, this, is, exactly, analogous, to, neptunium, s, lanthanide, homolog, promethium, and, conforms, to, the, trend, set, by, the, other, actinides, with, their, 5f, n, electron, configurations, in, the, tripositive, state, the, first, ionization, potential, of, neptunium, was, measured, to, be, at, most, 6, 19, 0, 12, ev, in, 1974, based, on, the, assumption, that, the, 7s, electrons, would, ionize, before, 5f, and, 6d, more, recent, measurements, have, refined, this, to, 6, 2657, ev, twenty, four, neptunium, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, the, most, stable, being, 237, np, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 14, million, years, 236, np, with, a, half, life, of, 154, 000, years, and, 235, np, with, a, half, life, of, 396, 1, days, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 4, 5, days, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 50, minutes, this, element, also, has, at, least, four, meta, states, with, the, most, stable, being, 236m, np, with, a, half, life, of, 22, 5, hours, the, isotopes, of, neptunium, range, in, atomic, weight, from, 219, 032, u, 219, np, to, 244, 068, u, 244, np, though, 221, np, has, not, yet, been, reported, most, of, the, isotopes, that, are, lighter, than, the, most, stable, one, 237, np, decay, primarily, by, electron, capture, although, a, sizable, number, most, notably, 229, np, and, 230, np, also, exhibit, various, levels, of, decay, via, alpha, emission, to, become, protactinium, 237, np, itself, being, the, beta, stable, isobar, of, mass, number, 237, decays, almost, exclusively, by, alpha, emission, into, 233, pa, with, very, rare, occurring, only, about, once, in, trillions, of, decays, spontaneous, fission, and, cluster, decay, emission, of, 30, mg, to, form, 207, tl, all, of, the, known, isotopes, except, one, that, are, heavier, than, this, decay, exclusively, via, beta, emission, the, lone, exception, 240m, np, exhibits, a, rare, 0, 12, decay, by, isomeric, transition, in, addition, to, beta, emission, 237, np, eventually, decays, to, form, bismuth, 209, and, thallium, 205, unlike, most, other, common, heavy, nuclei, which, decay, into, isotopes, of, lead, this, decay, chain, is, known, as, the, neptunium, series, this, decay, chain, had, long, been, extinct, on, earth, due, to, the, short, half, lives, of, all, of, its, isotopes, above, bismuth, 209, but, is, now, being, resurrected, thanks, to, artificial, production, of, neptunium, on, the, tonne, scale, the, isotopes, neptunium, 235, 236, and, 237, are, predicted, to, be, fissile, only, neptunium, 237, s, fissionability, has, been, experimentally, shown, with, the, critical, mass, being, about, 60, kg, only, about, 10, kg, more, than, that, of, the, commonly, used, uranium, 235, calculated, values, of, the, critical, masses, of, neptunium, 235, 236, and, 237, respectively, are, 66, 2, kg, 6, 79, kg, and, 63, 6, kg, the, neptunium, 236, value, is, even, lower, than, that, of, plutonium, 239, in, particular, 236, np, also, has, a, low, neutron, cross, section, despite, this, a, neptunium, atomic, bomb, has, never, been, built, uranium, and, plutonium, have, lower, critical, masses, than, 235, np, and, 237, np, and, 236, np, is, difficult, to, purify, as, it, is, not, found, in, quantity, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, and, is, nearly, impossible, to, separate, in, any, significant, quantities, from, 237, np, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, neptunium, 237, np, has, a, half, life, of, 2, 14, million, years, which, is, more, than, 2, 000, times, shorter, than, the, age, of, the, earth, therefore, any, primordial, neptunium, would, have, decayed, in, the, distant, past, after, only, about, 80, million, years, the, concentration, of, even, the, longest, lived, isotope, 237, np, would, have, been, reduced, to, less, than, one, trillionth, 10, 12, of, its, original, amount, thus, neptunium, is, present, in, nature, only, in, negligible, amounts, produced, as, intermediate, decay, products, of, other, isotopes, trace, amounts, of, the, neptunium, isotopes, neptunium, 237, and, 239, are, found, naturally, as, decay, products, from, transmutation, reactions, in, uranium, ores, 239, np, and, 237, np, are, the, most, common, of, these, isotopes, they, are, directly, formed, from, neutron, capture, by, uranium, 238, atoms, these, neutrons, come, from, the, spontaneous, fission, of, uranium, 238, naturally, neutron, induced, fission, of, uranium, 235, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, nuclei, and, light, elements, absorbing, alpha, particles, and, emitting, a, neutron, the, half, life, of, 239, np, is, very, short, although, the, detection, of, its, much, longer, lived, daughter, 239, pu, in, nature, in, 1951, definitively, established, its, natural, occurrence, in, 1952, 237, np, was, identified, and, isolated, from, concentrates, of, uranium, ore, from, the, belgian, congo, in, these, minerals, the, ratio, of, neptunium, 237, to, uranium, is, less, than, or, equal, to, about, 10, 12, to, 1, additionally, 240, np, must, also, occur, as, an, intermediate, decay, product, of, 244, pu, which, has, been, detected, in, meteorite, dust, in, marine, sediments, on, earth, most, neptunium, and, plutonium, now, encountered, in, the, environment, is, due, to, atmospheric, nuclear, explosions, that, took, place, between, the, detonation, of, the, first, atomic, bomb, in, 1945, and, the, ratification, of, the, partial, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, in, 1963, the, total, amount, of, neptunium, released, by, these, explosions, and, the, few, atmospheric, tests, that, have, been, carried, out, since, 1963, is, estimated, to, be, around, 2500, kg, the, overwhelming, majority, of, this, is, composed, of, the, long, lived, isotopes, 236, np, and, 237, np, since, even, the, moderately, long, lived, 235, np, half, life, 396, days, would, have, decayed, to, less, than, one, billionth, 10, 9, its, original, concentration, over, the, intervening, decades, an, additional, very, small, amount, of, neptunium, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, of, natural, uranium, in, nuclear, reactor, cooling, water, is, released, when, the, water, is, discharged, into, rivers, or, lakes, the, concentration, of, 237, np, in, seawater, is, approximately, 6, 5, 10, 5, millibecquerels, per, liter, this, concentration, is, between, 0, 1, and, 1, that, of, plutonium, once, released, in, the, surface, environment, in, contact, with, atmospheric, oxygen, neptunium, generally, oxidizes, fairly, quickly, usually, to, the, 4, or, 5, state, regardless, of, its, oxidation, state, the, element, exhibits, much, greater, mobility, than, the, other, actinides, largely, due, to, its, ability, to, readily, form, aqueous, solutions, with, various, other, elements, in, one, study, comparing, the, diffusion, rates, of, neptunium, v, plutonium, iv, and, americium, iii, in, sandstone, and, limestone, neptunium, penetrated, more, than, ten, times, as, well, as, the, other, elements, np, v, will, also, react, efficiently, in, ph, levels, greater, than, 5, 5, if, there, are, no, carbonates, present, and, in, these, conditions, it, has, also, been, observed, to, readily, bond, with, quartz, it, has, also, been, observed, to, bond, well, with, goethite, ferric, oxide, colloids, and, several, clays, including, kaolinite, and, smectite, np, v, does, not, bond, as, readily, to, soil, particles, in, mildly, acidic, conditions, as, its, fellow, actinides, americium, and, curium, by, nearly, an, order, of, magnitude, this, behavior, enables, it, to, migrate, rapidly, through, the, soil, while, in, solution, without, becoming, fixed, in, place, contributing, further, to, its, mobility, np, v, is, also, readily, absorbed, by, concrete, which, because, of, the, element, s, radioactivity, is, a, consideration, that, must, be, addressed, when, building, nuclear, waste, storage, facilities, when, absorbed, in, concrete, it, is, reduced, to, np, iv, in, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, np, v, is, also, reduced, by, humic, acids, if, they, are, present, on, the, surface, of, goethite, hematite, and, magnetite, np, iv, is, less, mobile, and, efficiently, adsorbed, by, tuff, granodiorite, and, bentonite, although, uptake, by, the, latter, is, most, pronounced, in, mildly, acidic, conditions, it, also, exhibits, a, strong, tendency, to, bind, to, colloidal, particulates, an, effect, that, is, enhanced, when, in, surface, soil, with, high, clay, content, the, behavior, provides, an, additional, aid, in, the, element, s, observed, high, mobility, when, the, first, periodic, table, of, the, elements, was, published, by, dmitri, mendeleev, in, the, early, 1870s, it, showed, a, in, place, after, uranium, similar, to, several, other, places, for, then, undiscovered, elements, other, subsequent, tables, of, known, elements, including, a, 1913, publication, of, the, known, radioactive, isotopes, by, kasimir, fajans, also, show, an, empty, place, after, uranium, element, 92, up, to, and, after, the, discovery, of, the, final, component, of, the, atomic, nucleus, the, neutron, in, 1932, most, scientists, did, not, seriously, consider, the, possibility, of, elements, heavier, than, uranium, while, nuclear, theory, at, the, time, did, not, explicitly, prohibit, their, existence, there, was, little, evidence, to, suggest, that, they, did, however, the, discovery, of, induced, radioactivity, by, ir, ne, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, in, late, 1933, opened, up, an, entirely, new, method, of, researching, the, elements, and, inspired, a, small, group, of, italian, scientists, led, by, enrico, fermi, to, begin, a, series, of, experiments, involving, neutron, bombardment, although, the, joliot, curies, experiment, involved, bombarding, a, sample, of, 27, al, with, alpha, particles, to, produce, the, radioactive, 30, p, fermi, realized, that, using, neutrons, which, have, no, electrical, charge, would, most, likely, produce, even, better, results, than, the, positively, charged, alpha, particles, accordingly, in, march, 1934, he, began, systematically, subjecting, all, of, the, then, known, elements, to, neutron, bombardment, to, determine, whether, others, could, also, be, induced, to, radioactivity, after, several, months, of, work, fermi, s, group, had, tentatively, determined, that, lighter, elements, would, disperse, the, energy, of, the, captured, neutron, by, emitting, a, proton, or, alpha, particle, and, heavier, elements, would, generally, accomplish, the, same, by, emitting, a, gamma, ray, this, latter, behavior, would, later, result, in, the, beta, decay, of, a, neutron, into, a, proton, thus, moving, the, resulting, isotope, one, place, up, the, periodic, table, when, fermi, s, team, bombarded, uranium, they, observed, this, behavior, as, well, which, strongly, suggested, that, the, resulting, isotope, had, an, atomic, number, of, 93, fermi, was, initially, reluctant, to, publicize, such, a, claim, but, after, his, team, observed, several, unknown, half, lives, in, the, uranium, bombardment, products, that, did, not, match, those, of, any, known, isotope, he, published, a, paper, entitled, possible, production, of, elements, of, atomic, number, higher, than, 92, in, june, 1934, for, element, 93, he, proposed, the, name, ausenium, atomic, symbol, ao, after, the, greek, name, ausonia, for, italy, several, theoretical, objections, to, the, claims, of, fermi, s, paper, were, quickly, raised, in, particular, the, exact, process, that, took, place, when, an, atom, captured, a, neutron, was, not, well, understood, at, the, time, this, and, fermi, s, accidental, discovery, three, months, later, that, nuclear, reactions, could, be, induced, by, slow, neutrons, cast, further, doubt, in, the, minds, of, many, scientists, notably, aristid, von, grosse, and, ida, noddack, that, the, experiment, was, creating, element, 93, while, von, grosse, s, claim, that, fermi, was, actually, producing, protactinium, element, 91, was, quickly, tested, and, disproved, noddack, s, proposal, that, the, uranium, had, been, shattered, into, two, or, more, much, smaller, fragments, was, simply, ignored, by, most, because, existing, nuclear, theory, did, not, include, a, way, for, this, to, be, possible, fermi, and, his, team, maintained, that, they, were, in, fact, synthesizing, a, new, element, but, the, issue, remained, unresolved, for, several, years, although, the, many, different, and, unknown, radioactive, half, lives, in, the, experiment, s, results, showed, that, several, nuclear, reactions, were, occurring, fermi, s, group, could, not, prove, that, element, 93, was, being, produced, unless, they, could, isolate, it, chemically, they, and, many, other, scientists, attempted, to, accomplish, this, including, otto, hahn, and, lise, meitner, who, were, among, the, best, radiochemists, in, the, world, at, the, time, and, supporters, of, fermi, s, claim, but, they, all, failed, much, later, it, was, determined, that, the, main, reason, for, this, failure, was, because, the, predictions, of, element, 93, s, chemical, properties, were, based, on, a, periodic, table, which, lacked, the, actinide, series, this, arrangement, placed, protactinium, below, tantalum, uranium, below, tungsten, and, further, suggested, that, element, 93, at, that, point, referred, to, as, eka, rhenium, should, be, similar, to, the, group, 7, elements, including, manganese, and, rhenium, thorium, protactinium, and, uranium, with, their, dominant, oxidation, states, of, 4, 5, and, 6, respectively, fooled, scientists, into, thinking, they, belonged, below, hafnium, tantalum, and, tungsten, rather, than, below, the, lanthanide, series, which, was, at, the, time, viewed, as, a, fluke, and, whose, members, all, have, dominant, 3, states, neptunium, on, the, other, hand, has, a, much, rarer, more, unstable, 7, state, with, 4, and, 5, being, the, most, stable, upon, finding, that, plutonium, and, the, other, transuranic, elements, also, have, dominant, 3, and, 4, states, along, with, the, discovery, of, the, f, block, the, actinide, series, was, firmly, established, while, the, question, of, whether, fermi, s, experiment, had, produced, element, 93, was, stalemated, two, additional, claims, of, the, discovery, of, the, element, appeared, although, unlike, fermi, they, both, claimed, to, have, observed, it, in, nature, the, first, of, these, claims, was, by, czech, engineer, odolen, koblic, in, 1934, when, he, extracted, a, small, amount, of, material, from, the, wash, water, of, heated, pitchblende, he, proposed, the, name, bohemium, for, the, element, but, after, being, analyzed, it, turned, out, that, the, sample, was, a, mixture, of, tungsten, and, vanadium, the, other, claim, in, 1938, by, romanian, physicist, horia, hulubei, and, french, chemist, yvette, cauchois, claimed, to, have, discovered, the, new, element, via, spectroscopy, in, minerals, they, named, their, element, sequanium, but, the, claim, was, discounted, because, the, prevailing, theory, at, the, time, was, that, if, it, existed, at, all, element, 93, would, not, exist, naturally, however, as, neptunium, does, in, fact, occur, in, nature, in, trace, amounts, as, demonstrated, when, it, was, found, in, uranium, ore, in, 1952, it, is, possible, that, hulubei, and, cauchois, did, in, fact, observe, neptunium, although, by, 1938, some, scientists, including, niels, bohr, were, still, reluctant, to, accept, that, fermi, had, actually, produced, a, new, element, he, was, nevertheless, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, november, 1938, for, his, demonstrations, of, the, existence, of, new, radioactive, elements, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, and, for, his, related, discovery, of, nuclear, reactions, brought, about, by, slow, neutrons, a, month, later, the, almost, totally, unexpected, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, by, hahn, meitner, and, otto, frisch, put, an, end, to, the, possibility, that, fermi, had, discovered, element, 93, because, most, of, the, unknown, half, lives, that, had, been, observed, by, fermi, s, team, were, rapidly, identified, as, those, of, fission, products, perhaps, the, closest, of, all, attempts, to, produce, the, missing, element, 93, was, that, conducted, by, the, japanese, physicist, yoshio, nishina, working, with, chemist, kenjiro, kimura, in, 1940, just, before, the, outbreak, of, the, pacific, war, in, 1941, they, bombarded, 238, u, with, fast, neutrons, however, while, slow, neutrons, tend, to, induce, neutron, capture, through, a, n, reaction, fast, neutrons, tend, to, induce, a, knock, out, n, 2n, reaction, where, one, neutron, is, added, and, two, more, are, removed, resulting, in, the, net, loss, of, a, neutron, nishina, and, kimura, having, tested, this, technique, on, 232, th, and, successfully, produced, the, known, 231, th, and, its, long, lived, beta, decay, daughter, 231, pa, both, occurring, in, the, natural, decay, chain, of, 235, u, therefore, correctly, assigned, the, new, 6, 75, day, half, life, activity, they, observed, to, the, new, isotope, 237, u, they, confirmed, that, this, isotope, was, also, a, beta, emitter, and, must, hence, decay, to, the, unknown, nuclide, 237, 93, they, attempted, to, isolate, this, nuclide, by, carrying, it, with, its, supposed, lighter, congener, rhenium, but, no, beta, or, alpha, decay, was, observed, from, the, rhenium, containing, fraction, nishina, and, kimura, thus, correctly, speculated, that, the, half, life, of, 237, 93, like, that, of, 231, pa, was, very, long, and, hence, its, activity, would, be, so, weak, as, to, be, unmeasurable, by, their, equipment, thus, concluding, the, last, and, closest, unsuccessful, search, for, transuranic, elements, as, research, on, nuclear, fission, progressed, in, early, 1939, edwin, mcmillan, at, the, berkeley, radiation, laboratory, of, the, university, of, california, berkeley, decided, to, run, an, experiment, bombarding, uranium, using, the, powerful, 60, inch, 1, 52, m, cyclotron, that, had, recently, been, built, at, the, university, the, purpose, was, to, separate, the, various, fission, products, produced, by, the, bombardment, by, exploiting, the, enormous, force, that, the, fragments, gain, from, their, mutual, electrical, repulsion, after, fissioning, although, he, did, not, discover, anything, of, note, from, this, mcmillan, did, observe, two, new, beta, decay, half, lives, in, the, uranium, trioxide, target, itself, which, meant, that, whatever, was, producing, the, radioactivity, had, not, violently, repelled, each, other, like, normal, fission, products, he, quickly, realized, that, one, of, the, half, lives, closely, matched, the, known, 23, minute, decay, period, of, uranium, 239, but, the, other, half, life, of, 2, 3, days, was, unknown, mcmillan, took, the, results, of, his, experiment, to, chemist, and, fellow, berkeley, professor, emilio, segr, to, attempt, to, isolate, the, source, of, the, radioactivity, both, scientists, began, their, work, using, the, prevailing, theory, that, element, 93, would, have, similar, chemistry, to, rhenium, but, segr, rapidly, determined, that, mcmillan, s, sample, was, not, at, all, similar, to, rhenium, instead, when, he, reacted, it, with, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, with, a, strong, oxidizing, agent, present, it, behaved, much, like, members, of, the, rare, earths, since, these, elements, comprise, a, large, percentage, of, fission, products, segr, and, mcmillan, decided, that, the, half, life, must, have, been, simply, another, fission, product, titling, the, paper, an, unsuccessful, search, for, transuranium, elements, however, as, more, information, about, fission, became, available, the, possibility, that, the, fragments, of, nuclear, fission, could, still, have, been, present, in, the, target, became, more, remote, mcmillan, and, several, scientists, including, philip, h, abelson, attempted, again, to, determine, what, was, producing, the, unknown, half, life, in, early, 1940, mcmillan, realized, that, his, 1939, experiment, with, segr, had, failed, to, test, the, chemical, reactions, of, the, radioactive, source, with, sufficient, rigor, in, a, new, experiment, mcmillan, tried, subjecting, the, unknown, substance, to, hf, in, the, presence, of, a, reducing, agent, something, he, had, not, done, before, this, reaction, resulted, in, the, sample, precipitating, with, the, hf, an, action, that, definitively, ruled, out, the, possibility, that, the, unknown, substance, was, a, rare, earth, metal, shortly, after, this, abelson, who, had, received, his, graduate, degree, from, the, university, visited, berkeley, for, a, short, vacation, and, mcmillan, asked, the, more, able, chemist, to, assist, with, the, separation, of, the, experiment, s, results, abelson, very, quickly, observed, that, whatever, was, producing, the, 2, 3, day, half, life, did, not, have, chemistry, like, any, known, element, and, was, actually, more, similar, to, uranium, than, a, rare, earth, metal, this, discovery, finally, allowed, the, source, to, be, isolated, and, later, in, 1945, led, to, the, classification, of, the, actinide, series, as, a, final, step, mcmillan, and, abelson, prepared, a, much, larger, sample, of, bombarded, uranium, that, had, a, prominent, 23, minute, half, life, from, 239, u, and, demonstrated, conclusively, that, the, unknown, 2, 3, day, half, life, increased, in, strength, in, concert, with, a, decrease, in, the, 23, minute, activity, through, the, following, reaction, this, proved, that, the, unknown, radioactive, source, originated, from, the, decay, of, uranium, and, coupled, with, the, previous, observation, that, the, source, was, different, chemically, from, all, known, elements, proved, beyond, all, doubt, that, a, new, element, had, been, discovered, mcmillan, and, abelson, published, their, results, in, a, paper, entitled, radioactive, element, 93, in, the, physical, review, on, may, 27, 1940, they, did, not, propose, a, name, for, the, element, in, the, paper, but, they, soon, decided, on, the, name, neptunium, since, neptune, is, the, next, planet, beyond, uranus, in, our, solar, system, which, uranium, is, named, after, mcmillan, and, abelson, s, success, compared, to, nishina, and, kimura, s, near, miss, can, be, attributed, to, the, favorable, half, life, of, 239, np, for, radiochemical, analysis, and, quick, decay, of, 239, u, in, contrast, to, the, slower, decay, of, 237, u, and, extremely, long, half, life, of, 237, np, it, was, also, realized, that, the, beta, decay, of, 239, np, must, produce, an, isotope, of, element, 94, now, called, plutonium, but, the, quantities, involved, in, mcmillan, and, abelson, s, original, experiment, were, too, small, to, isolate, and, identify, plutonium, along, with, neptunium, the, discovery, of, plutonium, had, to, wait, until, the, end, of, 1940, when, glenn, t, seaborg, and, his, team, identified, the, isotope, plutonium, 238, in, 1942, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, and, independently, kurt, starke, reported, the, confirmation, of, element, 93, in, berlin, hahn, s, group, did, not, pursue, element, 94, likely, because, they, were, discouraged, by, mcmillan, and, abelson, s, lack, of, success, in, isolating, it, since, they, had, access, to, the, stronger, cyclotron, at, paris, at, this, point, hahn, s, group, would, likely, have, been, able, to, detect, element, 94, had, they, tried, albeit, in, tiny, quantities, a, few, becquerels, neptunium, s, unique, radioactive, characteristics, allowed, it, to, be, traced, as, it, moved, through, various, compounds, in, chemical, reactions, at, first, this, was, the, only, method, available, to, prove, that, its, chemistry, was, different, from, other, elements, as, the, first, isotope, of, neptunium, to, be, discovered, has, such, a, short, half, life, mcmillan, and, abelson, were, unable, to, prepare, a, sample, that, was, large, enough, to, perform, chemical, analysis, of, the, new, element, using, the, technology, that, was, then, available, however, after, the, discovery, of, the, long, lived, 237, np, isotope, in, 1942, by, glenn, seaborg, and, arthur, wahl, forming, weighable, amounts, of, neptunium, became, a, realistic, endeavor, its, half, life, was, initially, determined, to, be, about, 3, million, years, later, revised, to, 2, 144, million, years, confirming, the, predictions, of, nishina, and, kimura, of, a, very, long, half, life, early, research, into, the, element, was, somewhat, limited, because, most, of, the, nuclear, physicists, and, chemists, in, the, united, states, at, the, time, were, focused, on, the, massive, effort, to, research, the, properties, of, plutonium, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, research, into, the, element, did, continue, as, a, minor, part, of, the, project, and, the, first, bulk, sample, of, neptunium, was, isolated, in, 1944, much, of, the, research, into, the, properties, of, neptunium, since, then, has, been, focused, on, understanding, how, to, confine, it, as, a, portion, of, nuclear, waste, because, it, has, isotopes, with, very, long, half, lives, it, is, of, particular, concern, in, the, context, of, designing, confinement, facilities, that, can, last, for, thousands, of, years, it, has, found, some, limited, uses, as, a, radioactive, tracer, and, a, precursor, for, various, nuclear, reactions, to, produce, useful, plutonium, isotopes, however, most, of, the, neptunium, that, is, produced, as, a, reaction, byproduct, in, nuclear, power, stations, is, considered, to, be, a, waste, product, the, vast, majority, of, the, neptunium, that, currently, exists, on, earth, was, produced, artificially, in, nuclear, reactions, neptunium, 237, is, the, most, commonly, synthesized, isotope, due, to, it, being, the, only, one, that, both, can, be, produced, via, neutron, capture, and, also, has, a, half, life, long, enough, to, allow, weighable, quantities, to, be, easily, isolated, it, is, by, far, the, most, common, isotope, to, be, utilized, in, chemical, studies, of, the, element, heavier, isotopes, of, neptunium, decay, quickly, and, lighter, isotopes, of, neptunium, cannot, be, produced, by, neutron, capture, so, chemical, separation, of, neptunium, from, cooled, spent, nuclear, fuel, gives, nearly, pure, 237, np, the, short, lived, heavier, isotopes, 238, np, and, 239, np, useful, as, radioactive, tracers, are, produced, through, neutron, irradiation, of, 237, np, and, 238, u, respectively, while, the, longer, lived, lighter, isotopes, 235, np, and, 236, np, are, produced, through, irradiation, of, 235, u, with, protons, and, deuterons, in, a, cyclotron, artificial, 237, np, metal, is, usually, isolated, through, a, reaction, of, 237, npf, 3, with, liquid, barium, or, lithium, at, around, 1200, c, and, is, most, often, extracted, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, rods, in, kilogram, amounts, as, a, by, product, in, plutonium, production, by, weight, neptunium, 237, discharges, are, about, 5, as, great, as, plutonium, discharges, and, about, 0, 05, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, discharges, however, even, this, fraction, still, amounts, to, more, than, fifty, tons, per, year, globally, recovering, uranium, and, plutonium, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, for, reuse, is, one, of, the, major, processes, of, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, as, it, has, a, long, half, life, of, just, over, 2, million, years, the, alpha, emitter, 237, np, is, one, of, the, major, isotopes, of, the, minor, actinides, separated, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, many, separation, methods, have, been, used, to, separate, out, the, neptunium, operating, on, small, and, large, scales, the, small, scale, purification, operations, have, the, goals, of, preparing, pure, neptunium, as, a, precursor, of, metallic, neptunium, and, its, compounds, and, also, to, isolate, and, preconcentrate, neptunium, in, samples, for, analysis, most, methods, that, separate, neptunium, ions, exploit, the, differing, chemical, behaviour, of, the, differing, oxidation, states, of, neptunium, from, 3, to, 6, or, sometimes, even, 7, in, solution, among, the, methods, that, are, or, have, been, used, are, solvent, extraction, using, various, extractants, usually, multidentate, diketone, derivatives, organophosphorus, compounds, and, amine, compounds, chromatography, using, various, ion, exchange, or, chelating, resins, coprecipitation, possible, matrices, include, laf, 3, bipo, 4, baso, 4, fe, oh, 3, and, mno, 2, electrodeposition, and, biotechnological, methods, currently, commercial, reprocessing, plants, use, the, purex, process, involving, the, solvent, extraction, of, uranium, and, plutonium, with, tributyl, phosphate, when, it, is, in, an, aqueous, solution, neptunium, can, exist, in, any, of, its, five, possible, oxidation, states, 3, to, 7, and, each, of, these, show, a, characteristic, color, the, stability, of, each, oxidation, state, is, strongly, dependent, on, various, factors, such, as, the, presence, of, oxidizing, or, reducing, agents, ph, of, the, solution, presence, of, coordination, complex, forming, ligands, and, even, the, concentration, of, neptunium, in, the, solution, in, acidic, solutions, the, neptunium, iii, to, neptunium, vii, ions, exist, as, np, 3, np, 4, npo, 2, npo, 2, 2, and, npo, 3, in, basic, solutions, they, exist, as, the, oxides, and, hydroxides, np, oh, 3, npo, 2, npo, 2, oh, npo, 2, oh, 2, and, npo, 3, 5, not, as, much, work, has, been, done, to, characterize, neptunium, in, basic, solutions, np, 3, and, np, 4, can, easily, be, reduced, and, oxidized, to, each, other, as, can, npo, 2, and, npo, 2, 2, np, iii, or, np, 3, exists, as, hydrated, complexes, in, acidic, solutions, np, h, 2, o, 3, n, it, is, a, dark, blue, purple, and, is, analogous, to, its, lighter, congener, the, pink, rare, earth, ion, pm, 3, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, it, is, quickly, oxidized, to, np, iv, unless, strong, reducing, agents, are, also, present, nevertheless, it, is, the, second, least, easily, hydrolyzed, neptunium, ion, in, water, forming, the, npoh, 2, ion, np, 3, is, the, predominant, neptunium, ion, in, solutions, of, ph, 4, 5, np, iv, or, np, 4, is, pale, yellow, green, in, acidic, solutions, where, it, exists, as, hydrated, complexes, np, h, 2, o, 4, n, it, is, quite, unstable, to, hydrolysis, in, acidic, aqueous, solutions, at, ph, 1, and, above, forming, npoh, 3, in, basic, solutions, np, 4, tends, to, hydrolyze, to, form, the, neutral, neptunium, iv, hydroxide, np, oh, 4, and, neptunium, iv, oxide, npo, 2, np, v, or, npo, 2, is, green, blue, in, aqueous, solution, in, which, it, behaves, as, a, strong, lewis, acid, it, is, a, stable, ion, and, is, the, most, common, form, of, neptunium, in, aqueous, solutions, unlike, its, neighboring, homologues, uo, 2, and, puo, 2, npo, 2, does, not, spontaneously, disproportionate, except, at, very, low, ph, and, high, concentration, it, hydrolyzes, in, basic, solutions, to, form, npo, 2, oh, and, npo, 2, oh, 2, np, vi, or, npo, 2, 2, the, neptunyl, ion, shows, a, light, pink, or, reddish, color, in, an, acidic, solution, and, yellow, green, otherwise, it, is, a, strong, lewis, acid, and, is, the, main, neptunium, ion, encountered, in, solutions, of, ph, 3, 4, though, stable, in, acidic, solutions, it, is, quite, easily, reduced, to, the, np, v, ion, and, it, is, not, as, stable, as, the, homologous, hexavalent, ions, of, its, neighbours, uranium, and, plutonium, the, uranyl, and, plutonyl, ions, it, hydrolyzes, in, basic, solutions, to, form, the, oxo, and, hydroxo, ions, npo, 2, oh, npo, 2, 2, oh, 2, 2, and, npo, 2, 3, oh, 5, np, vii, is, dark, green, in, a, strongly, basic, solution, though, its, chemical, formula, in, basic, solution, is, frequently, cited, as, npo, 3, 5, this, is, a, simplification, and, the, real, structure, is, probably, closer, to, a, hydroxo, species, like, 3, np, vii, was, first, prepared, in, basic, solution, in, 1967, in, strongly, acidic, solution, np, vii, is, found, as, npo, 3, water, quickly, reduces, this, to, np, vi, its, hydrolysis, products, are, uncharacterized, the, oxides, and, hydroxides, of, neptunium, are, closely, related, to, its, ions, in, general, np, hydroxides, at, various, oxidation, levels, are, less, stable, than, the, actinides, before, it, on, the, periodic, table, such, as, thorium, and, uranium, and, more, stable, than, those, after, it, such, as, plutonium, and, americium, this, phenomenon, is, because, the, stability, of, an, ion, increases, as, the, ratio, of, atomic, number, to, the, radius, of, the, ion, increases, thus, actinides, higher, on, the, periodic, table, will, more, readily, undergo, hydrolysis, neptunium, iii, hydroxide, is, quite, stable, in, acidic, solutions, and, in, environments, that, lack, oxygen, but, it, will, rapidly, oxidize, to, the, iv, state, in, the, presence, of, air, it, is, not, soluble, in, water, np, iv, hydroxides, exist, mainly, as, the, electrically, neutral, np, oh, 4, and, its, mild, solubility, in, water, is, not, affected, at, all, by, the, ph, of, the, solution, this, suggests, that, the, other, np, iv, hydroxide, np, oh, 5, does, not, have, a, significant, presence, because, the, np, v, ion, npo, 2, is, very, stable, it, can, only, form, a, hydroxide, in, high, acidity, levels, when, placed, in, a, 0, 1, m, sodium, perchlorate, solution, it, does, not, react, significantly, for, a, period, of, months, although, a, higher, molar, concentration, of, 3, 0, m, will, result, in, it, reacting, to, the, solid, hydroxide, npo, 2, oh, almost, immediately, np, vi, hydroxide, is, more, reactive, but, it, is, still, fairly, stable, in, acidic, solutions, it, will, form, the, compound, npo, 3, h, 2, o, in, the, presence, of, ozone, under, various, carbon, dioxide, pressures, np, vii, has, not, been, well, studied, and, no, neutral, hydroxides, have, been, reported, it, probably, exists, mostly, as, 3, three, anhydrous, neptunium, oxides, have, been, reported, npo, 2, np, 2, o, 5, and, np, 3, o, 8, though, some, studies, have, stated, that, only, the, first, two, of, these, exist, suggesting, that, claims, of, np, 3, o, 8, are, actually, the, result, of, mistaken, analysis, of, np, 2, o, 5, however, as, the, full, extent, of, the, reactions, that, occur, between, neptunium, and, oxygen, has, yet, to, be, researched, it, is, not, certain, which, of, these, claims, is, accurate, although, neptunium, oxides, have, not, been, produced, with, neptunium, in, oxidation, states, as, high, as, those, possible, with, the, adjacent, actinide, uranium, neptunium, oxides, are, more, stable, at, lower, oxidation, states, this, behavior, is, illustrated, by, the, fact, that, npo, 2, can, be, produced, by, simply, burning, neptunium, salts, of, oxyacids, in, air, the, greenish, brown, npo, 2, is, very, stable, over, a, large, range, of, pressures, and, temperatures, and, does, not, undergo, phase, transitions, at, low, temperatures, it, does, show, a, phase, transition, from, face, centered, cubic, to, orthorhombic, at, around, 33, 37, gpa, although, it, returns, to, its, original, phase, when, pressure, is, released, it, remains, stable, under, oxygen, pressures, up, to, 2, 84, mpa, and, temperatures, up, to, 400, c, np, 2, o, 5, is, black, brown, in, color, and, monoclinic, with, a, lattice, size, of, 418, 658, 409, picometres, it, is, relatively, unstable, and, decomposes, to, npo, 2, and, o, 2, at, 420, 695, c, although, np, 2, o, 5, was, initially, subject, to, several, studies, that, claimed, to, produce, it, with, mutually, contradictory, methods, it, was, eventually, prepared, successfully, by, heating, neptunium, peroxide, to, 300, 350, c, for, 2, 3, hours, or, by, heating, it, under, a, layer, of, water, in, an, ampoule, at, 180, c, neptunium, also, forms, a, large, number, of, oxide, compounds, with, a, wide, variety, of, elements, although, the, neptunate, oxides, formed, with, alkali, metals, and, alkaline, earth, metals, have, been, by, far, the, most, studied, ternary, neptunium, oxides, are, generally, formed, by, reacting, npo, 2, with, the, oxide, of, another, element, or, by, precipitating, from, an, alkaline, solution, li, 5, npo, 6, has, been, prepared, by, reacting, li, 2, o, and, npo, 2, at, 400, c, for, 16, hours, or, by, reacting, li, 2, o, 2, with, npo, 3, h, 2, o, at, 400, c, for, 16, hours, in, a, quartz, tube, and, flowing, oxygen, alkali, neptunate, compounds, k, 3, npo, 5, cs, 3, npo, 5, and, rb, 3, npo, 5, are, all, produced, by, a, similar, reaction, the, oxide, compounds, knpo, 4, csnpo, 4, and, rbnpo, 4, are, formed, by, reacting, np, vii, 3, with, a, compound, of, the, alkali, metal, nitrate, and, ozone, additional, compounds, have, been, produced, by, reacting, npo, 3, and, water, with, solid, alkali, and, alkaline, peroxides, at, temperatures, of, 400, 600, c, for, 15, 30, hours, some, of, these, include, ba, 3, npo, 5, 2, ba, 2, na, npo, 6, and, ba, 2, linpo, 6, also, a, considerable, number, of, hexavalent, neptunium, oxides, are, formed, by, reacting, solid, state, npo, 2, with, various, alkali, or, alkaline, earth, oxides, in, an, environment, of, flowing, oxygen, many, of, the, resulting, compounds, also, have, an, equivalent, compound, that, substitutes, uranium, for, neptunium, some, compounds, that, have, been, characterized, include, na, 2, np, 2, o, 7, na, 4, npo, 5, na, 6, npo, 6, and, na, 2, npo, 4, these, can, be, obtained, by, heating, different, combinations, of, npo, 2, and, na, 2, o, to, various, temperature, thresholds, and, further, heating, will, also, cause, these, compounds, to, exhibit, different, neptunium, allotropes, the, lithium, neptunate, oxides, li, 6, npo, 6, and, li, 4, npo, 5, can, be, obtained, with, similar, reactions, of, npo, 2, and, li, 2, o, a, large, number, of, additional, alkali, and, alkaline, neptunium, oxide, compounds, such, as, cs, 4, np, 5, o, 17, and, cs, 2, np, 3, o, 10, have, been, characterized, with, various, production, methods, neptunium, has, also, been, observed, to, form, ternary, oxides, with, many, additional, elements, in, groups, 3, through, 7, although, these, compounds, are, much, less, well, studied, although, neptunium, halide, compounds, have, not, been, nearly, as, well, studied, as, its, oxides, a, fairly, large, number, have, been, successfully, characterized, of, these, neptunium, fluorides, have, been, the, most, extensively, researched, largely, because, of, their, potential, use, in, separating, the, element, from, nuclear, waste, products, four, binary, neptunium, fluoride, compounds, np, f, 3, npf, 4, npf, 5, and, npf, 6, have, been, reported, the, first, two, are, fairly, stable, and, were, first, prepared, in, 1947, through, the, following, reactions, later, npf, 4, was, obtained, directly, by, heating, npo, 2, to, various, temperatures, in, mixtures, of, either, hydrogen, fluoride, or, pure, fluorine, gas, npf, 5, is, much, more, difficult, to, form, and, most, known,
