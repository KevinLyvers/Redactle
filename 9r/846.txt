in, chemistry, molecular, orbital, theory, mo, theory, or, mot, is, a, method, for, describing, the, electronic, structure, of, molecules, using, quantum, mechanics, it, was, proposed, early, in, the, 20th, century, in, molecular, orbital, theory, electrons, in, a, molecule, are, not, assigned, to, individual, chemical, bonds, between, atoms, but, are, treated, as, moving, under, the, influence, of, the, atomic, nuclei, in, the, whole, molecule, quantum, mechanics, describes, the, spatial, and, energetic, properties, of, electrons, as, molecular, orbitals, that, surround, two, or, more, atoms, in, a, molecule, and, contain, valence, electrons, between, atoms, molecular, orbital, theory, revolutionized, the, study, of, chemical, bonding, by, approximating, the, states, of, bonded, electrons, the, molecular, orbitals, as, linear, combinations, of, atomic, orbitals, lcao, these, approximations, are, made, by, applying, the, density, functional, theory, dft, or, hartree, fock, hf, models, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, molecular, orbital, theory, and, valence, bond, theory, are, the, foundational, theories, of, quantum, chemistry, in, the, lcao, method, each, molecule, has, a, set, of, molecular, orbitals, it, is, assumed, that, the, molecular, orbital, wave, function, j, can, be, written, as, a, simple, weighted, sum, of, the, n, constituent, atomic, orbitals, i, according, to, the, following, equation, j, i, 1, n, c, i, j, i, displaystyle, psi, j, sum, i, 1, n, c, ij, chi, i, one, may, determine, c, ij, coefficients, numerically, by, substituting, this, equation, into, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, applying, the, variational, principle, the, variational, principle, is, a, mathematical, technique, used, in, quantum, mechanics, to, build, up, the, coefficients, of, each, atomic, orbital, basis, a, larger, coefficient, means, that, the, orbital, basis, is, composed, more, of, that, particular, contributing, atomic, orbital, hence, the, molecular, orbital, is, best, characterized, by, that, type, this, method, of, quantifying, orbital, contribution, as, a, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, is, used, in, computational, chemistry, an, additional, unitary, transformation, can, be, applied, on, the, system, to, accelerate, the, convergence, in, some, computational, schemes, molecular, orbital, theory, was, seen, as, a, competitor, to, valence, bond, theory, in, the, 1930s, before, it, was, realized, that, the, two, methods, are, closely, related, and, that, when, extended, they, become, equivalent, molecular, orbital, theory, is, used, to, interpret, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, uv, vis, changes, to, the, electronic, structure, of, molecules, can, be, seen, by, the, absorbance, of, light, at, specific, wavelengths, assignments, can, be, made, to, these, signals, indicated, by, the, transition, of, electrons, moving, from, one, orbital, at, a, lower, energy, to, a, higher, energy, orbital, the, molecular, orbital, diagram, for, the, final, state, describes, the, electronic, nature, of, the, molecule, in, an, excited, state, there, are, three, main, requirements, for, atomic, orbital, combinations, to, be, suitable, as, approximate, molecular, orbitals, molecular, orbital, theory, was, developed, in, the, years, after, valence, bond, theory, had, been, established, 1927, primarily, through, the, efforts, of, friedrich, hund, robert, mulliken, john, c, slater, and, john, lennard, jones, mo, theory, was, originally, called, the, hund, mulliken, theory, according, to, physicist, and, physical, chemist, erich, h, ckel, the, first, quantitative, use, of, molecular, orbital, theory, was, the, 1929, paper, of, lennard, jones, this, paper, predicted, a, triplet, ground, state, for, the, dioxygen, molecule, which, explained, its, paramagnetism, see, molecular, orbital, diagram, dioxygen, before, valence, bond, theory, which, came, up, with, its, own, explanation, in, 1931, the, word, orbital, was, introduced, by, mulliken, in, 1932, by, 1933, the, molecular, orbital, theory, had, been, accepted, as, a, valid, and, useful, theory, erich, h, ckel, applied, molecular, orbital, theory, to, unsaturated, hydrocarbon, molecules, starting, in, 1931, with, his, h, ckel, molecular, orbital, hmo, method, for, the, determination, of, mo, energies, for, pi, electrons, which, he, applied, to, conjugated, and, aromatic, hydrocarbons, this, method, provided, an, explanation, of, the, stability, of, molecules, with, six, pi, electrons, such, as, benzene, the, first, accurate, calculation, of, a, molecular, orbital, wavefunction, was, that, made, by, charles, coulson, in, 1938, on, the, hydrogen, molecule, by, 1950, molecular, orbitals, were, completely, defined, as, eigenfunctions, wave, functions, of, the, self, consistent, field, hamiltonian, and, it, was, at, this, point, that, molecular, orbital, theory, became, fully, rigorous, and, consistent, this, rigorous, approach, is, known, as, the, hartree, fock, method, for, molecules, although, it, had, its, origins, in, calculations, on, atoms, in, calculations, on, molecules, the, molecular, orbitals, are, expanded, in, terms, of, an, atomic, orbital, basis, set, leading, to, the, roothaan, equations, this, led, to, the, development, of, many, ab, initio, quantum, chemistry, methods, in, parallel, molecular, orbital, theory, was, applied, in, a, more, approximate, manner, using, some, empirically, derived, parameters, in, methods, now, known, as, semi, empirical, quantum, chemistry, methods, the, success, of, molecular, orbital, theory, also, spawned, ligand, field, theory, which, was, developed, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, as, an, alternative, to, crystal, field, theory, molecular, orbital, mo, theory, uses, a, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, lcao, to, represent, molecular, orbitals, resulting, from, bonds, between, atoms, these, are, often, divided, into, three, types, bonding, antibonding, and, non, bonding, a, bonding, orbital, concentrates, electron, density, in, the, region, between, a, given, pair, of, atoms, so, that, its, electron, density, will, tend, to, attract, each, of, the, two, nuclei, toward, the, other, and, hold, the, two, atoms, together, an, anti, bonding, orbital, concentrates, electron, density, behind, each, nucleus, i, e, on, the, side, of, each, atom, which, is, farthest, from, the, other, atom, and, so, tends, to, pull, each, of, the, two, nuclei, away, from, the, other, and, actually, weaken, the, bond, between, the, two, nuclei, electrons, in, non, bonding, orbitals, tend, to, be, associated, with, atomic, orbitals, that, do, not, interact, positively, or, negatively, with, one, another, and, electrons, in, these, orbitals, neither, contribute, to, nor, detract, from, bond, strength, molecular, orbitals, are, further, divided, according, to, the, types, of, atomic, orbitals, they, are, formed, from, chemical, substances, will, form, bonding, interactions, if, their, orbitals, become, lower, in, energy, when, they, interact, with, each, other, different, bonding, orbitals, are, distinguished, that, differ, by, electron, configuration, electron, cloud, shape, and, by, energy, levels, the, molecular, orbitals, of, a, molecule, can, be, illustrated, in, molecular, orbital, diagrams, common, bonding, orbitals, are, sigma, orbitals, which, are, symmetric, about, the, bond, axis, and, pi, orbitals, with, a, nodal, plane, along, the, bond, axis, less, common, are, delta, orbitals, and, phi, orbitals, with, two, and, three, nodal, planes, respectively, along, the, bond, axis, antibonding, orbitals, are, signified, by, the, addition, of, an, asterisk, for, example, an, antibonding, pi, orbital, may, be, shown, as, bond, order, is, the, number, of, chemical, bonds, between, a, pair, of, atoms, the, bond, order, of, a, molecule, can, be, calculated, by, subtracting, the, number, of, electrons, in, anti, bonding, orbitals, from, the, number, of, bonding, orbitals, and, the, resulting, number, is, then, divided, by, two, a, molecule, is, expected, to, be, stable, if, it, has, bond, order, larger, than, zero, it, is, adequate, to, consider, the, valence, electron, to, determine, the, bond, order, because, for, principal, quantum, number, n, 1, when, mos, are, derived, from, 1s, aos, the, difference, in, number, of, electrons, in, bonding, and, anti, bonding, molecular, orbital, is, zero, so, there, is, no, net, effect, on, bond, order, if, the, electron, is, not, the, valence, one, bond, order, 1, 2, from, bond, order, one, can, predict, whether, a, bond, between, two, atoms, will, form, or, not, for, example, the, existence, of, he, 2, molecule, from, the, molecular, orbital, diagram, bond, order, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, that, means, no, bond, formation, will, occur, between, two, he, atoms, which, is, seen, experimentally, it, can, be, detected, under, very, low, temperature, and, pressure, molecular, beam, and, has, binding, energy, of, approximately, 0, 001, j, mol, besides, the, strength, of, a, bond, can, also, be, realized, from, bond, order, bo, for, example, h, 2, bo, 2, 0, 2, 1, bond, energy, 436, kj, mol, h, 2, bo, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, bond, energy, 171, kj, mol, as, bond, order, of, h, 2, is, smaller, than, h, 2, it, should, be, less, stable, which, is, observed, experimentally, and, can, be, seen, from, the, bond, energy, mot, provides, a, global, delocalized, perspective, on, chemical, bonding, in, mo, theory, any, electron, in, a, molecule, may, be, found, anywhere, in, the, molecule, since, quantum, conditions, allow, electrons, to, travel, under, the, influence, of, an, arbitrarily, large, number, of, nuclei, as, long, as, they, are, in, eigenstates, permitted, by, certain, quantum, rules, thus, when, excited, with, the, requisite, amount, of, energy, through, high, frequency, light, or, other, means, electrons, can, transition, to, higher, energy, molecular, orbitals, for, instance, in, the, simple, case, of, a, hydrogen, diatomic, molecule, promotion, of, a, single, electron, from, a, bonding, orbital, to, an, antibonding, orbital, can, occur, under, uv, radiation, this, promotion, weakens, the, bond, between, the, two, hydrogen, atoms, and, can, lead, to, photodissociation, the, breaking, of, a, chemical, bond, due, to, the, absorption, of, light, molecular, orbital, theory, is, used, to, interpret, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, uv, vis, changes, to, the, electronic, structure, of, molecules, can, be, seen, by, the, absorbance, of, light, at, specific, wavelengths, assignments, can, be, made, to, these, signals, indicated, by, the, transition, of, electrons, moving, from, one, orbital, at, a, lower, energy, to, a, higher, energy, orbital, the, molecular, orbital, diagram, for, the, final, state, describes, the, electronic, nature, of, the, molecule, in, an, excited, state, although, in, mo, theory, some, molecular, orbitals, may, hold, electrons, that, are, more, localized, between, specific, pairs, of, molecular, atoms, other, orbitals, may, hold, electrons, that, are, spread, more, uniformly, over, the, molecule, thus, overall, bonding, is, far, more, delocalized, in, mo, theory, which, makes, it, more, applicable, to, resonant, molecules, that, have, equivalent, non, integer, bond, orders, than, valence, bond, theory, this, makes, mo, theory, more, useful, for, the, description, of, extended, systems, robert, s, mulliken, who, actively, participated, in, the, advent, of, molecular, orbital, theory, considers, each, molecule, to, be, a, self, sufficient, unit, he, asserts, in, his, article, attempts, to, regard, a, molecule, as, consisting, of, specific, atomic, or, ionic, units, held, together, by, discrete, numbers, of, bonding, electrons, or, electron, pairs, are, considered, as, more, or, less, meaningless, except, as, an, approximation, in, special, cases, or, as, a, method, of, calculation, a, molecule, is, here, regarded, as, a, set, of, nuclei, around, each, of, which, is, grouped, an, electron, configuration, closely, similar, to, that, of, a, free, atom, in, an, external, field, except, that, the, outer, parts, of, the, electron, configurations, surrounding, each, nucleus, usually, belong, in, part, jointly, to, two, or, more, nuclei, an, example, is, the, mo, description, of, benzene, c, 6, h, 6, which, is, an, aromatic, hexagonal, ring, of, six, carbon, atoms, and, three, double, bonds, in, this, molecule, 24, of, the, 30, total, valence, bonding, electrons, 24, coming, from, carbon, atoms, and, 6, coming, from, hydrogen, atoms, are, located, in, 12, sigma, bonding, orbitals, which, are, located, mostly, between, pairs, of, atoms, c, c, or, c, h, similarly, to, the, electrons, in, the, valence, bond, description, however, in, benzene, the, remaining, six, bonding, electrons, are, located, in, three, pi, molecular, bonding, orbitals, that, are, delocalized, around, the, ring, two, of, these, electrons, are, in, an, mo, that, has, equal, orbital, contributions, from, all, six, atoms, the, other, four, electrons, are, in, orbitals, with, vertical, nodes, at, right, angles, to, each, other, as, in, the, vb, theory, all, of, these, six, delocalized, electrons, reside, in, a, larger, space, that, exists, above, and, below, the, ring, plane, all, carbon, carbon, bonds, in, benzene, are, chemically, equivalent, in, mo, theory, this, is, a, direct, consequence, of, the, fact, that, the, three, molecular, orbitals, combine, and, evenly, spread, the, extra, six, electrons, over, six, carbon, atoms, in, molecules, such, as, methane, ch, 4, the, eight, valence, electrons, are, found, in, four, mos, that, are, spread, out, over, all, five, atoms, it, is, possible, to, transform, the, mos, into, four, localized, sp, 3, orbitals, linus, pauling, in, 1931, hybridized, the, carbon, 2s, and, 2p, orbitals, so, that, they, pointed, directly, at, the, hydrogen, 1s, basis, functions, and, featured, maximal, overlap, however, the, delocalized, mo, description, is, more, appropriate, for, predicting, ionization, energies, and, the, positions, of, spectral, absorption, bands, when, methane, is, ionized, a, single, electron, is, taken, from, the, valence, mos, which, can, come, from, the, s, bonding, or, the, triply, degenerate, p, bonding, levels, yielding, two, ionization, energies, in, comparison, the, explanation, in, valence, bond, theory, is, more, complicated, when, one, electron, is, removed, from, an, sp, 3, orbital, resonance, is, invoked, between, four, valence, bond, structures, each, of, which, has, a, single, one, electron, bond, and, three, two, electron, bonds, triply, degenerate, t, 2, and, a, 1, ionized, states, ch, 4, are, produced, from, different, linear, combinations, of, these, four, structures, the, difference, in, energy, between, the, ionized, and, ground, state, gives, the, two, ionization, energies, as, in, benzene, in, substances, such, as, beta, carotene, chlorophyll, or, heme, some, electrons, in, the, orbitals, are, spread, out, in, molecular, orbitals, over, long, distances, in, a, molecule, resulting, in, light, absorption, in, lower, energies, the, visible, spectrum, which, accounts, for, the, characteristic, colours, of, these, substances, this, and, other, spectroscopic, data, for, molecules, are, well, explained, in, mo, theory, with, an, emphasis, on, electronic, states, associated, with, multicenter, orbitals, including, mixing, of, orbitals, premised, on, principles, of, orbital, symmetry, matching, the, same, mo, principles, also, naturally, explain, some, electrical, phenomena, such, as, high, electrical, conductivity, in, the, planar, direction, of, the, hexagonal, atomic, sheets, that, exist, in, graphite, this, results, from, continuous, band, overlap, of, half, filled, p, orbitals, and, explains, electrical, conduction, mo, theory, recognizes, that, some, electrons, in, the, graphite, atomic, sheets, are, completely, delocalized, over, arbitrary, distances, and, reside, in, very, large, molecular, orbitals, that, cover, an, entire, graphite, sheet, and, some, electrons, are, thus, as, free, to, move, and, therefore, conduct, electricity, in, the, sheet, plane, as, if, they, resided, in, a, metal
