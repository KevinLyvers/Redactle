https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)
the, foot, standard, symbol, ft, is, a, unit, of, length, in, the, british, imperial, and, united, states, customary, systems, of, measurement, the, prime, symbol, is, commonly, used, to, represent, the, foot, in, both, customary, and, imperial, units, one, foot, comprises, 12, inches, and, one, yard, comprises, three, feet, since, an, international, agreement, in, 1959, the, foot, is, defined, as, equal, to, exactly, 0, 3048, meters, historically, the, foot, was, a, part, of, many, local, systems, of, units, including, the, greek, roman, chinese, french, and, english, systems, it, varied, in, length, from, country, to, country, from, city, to, city, and, sometimes, from, trade, to, trade, its, length, was, usually, between, 250, mm, and, 335, mm, and, was, generally, but, not, always, subdivided, into, 12, inches, or, 16, digits, the, united, states, is, the, only, industrialized, country, that, uses, the, international, foot, in, preference, to, the, meter, in, its, commercial, engineering, and, standards, activities, the, foot, is, legally, recognized, in, the, united, kingdom, road, distance, signs, must, use, imperial, units, however, distances, on, road, signs, are, always, marked, in, miles, or, yards, not, feet, bridge, clearances, are, given, in, meters, as, well, as, feet, and, inches, while, its, usage, is, widespread, among, the, british, public, as, a, measurement, of, height, the, foot, is, recognized, as, an, alternative, expression, of, length, in, canada, both, the, uk, and, canada, have, partially, metricated, their, units, of, measurement, the, measurement, of, altitude, in, international, aviation, the, flight, level, unit, is, one, of, the, few, areas, where, the, foot, is, used, outside, the, english, speaking, world, the, most, common, plural, of, foot, is, feet, however, the, singular, form, may, be, used, like, a, plural, when, it, is, preceded, by, a, number, as, in, he, is, six, foot, tall, historically, the, human, body, has, been, used, to, provide, the, basis, for, units, of, length, the, foot, of, an, adult, european, american, male, is, typically, about, 15, 3, of, his, height, giving, a, person, of, 175, cm, 5, ft, 9, in, a, foot, length, of, about, 268, mm, 10, 6, in, on, average, archaeologists, believe, that, in, the, past, the, people, of, egypt, india, and, mesopotamia, preferred, the, cubit, while, the, people, of, rome, greece, and, china, preferred, the, foot, under, the, harappan, linear, measures, indus, cities, during, the, bronze, age, used, a, foot, of, 13, 2, inches, 335, mm, and, a, cubit, of, 20, 8, inches, 528, mm, the, egyptian, equivalent, of, the, foot, a, measure, of, four, palms, or, 16, digits, was, known, as, the, djeser, and, has, been, reconstructed, as, about, 30, cm, 11, 8, in, the, greek, foot, pous, had, a, length, of, 1, 600, of, a, stadion, one, stadion, being, about, 181, 2, m, 594, ft, therefore, a, foot, was, at, the, time, about, 302, mm, 11, 9, in, its, exact, size, varied, from, city, to, city, and, could, range, between, 270, mm, 10, 6, in, and, 350, mm, 13, 8, in, but, lengths, used, for, temple, construction, appear, to, have, been, about, 295, mm, 11, 6, in, to, 325, mm, 12, 8, in, the, former, was, close, to, the, size, of, the, roman, foot, the, standard, roman, foot, pes, was, normally, about, 295, 7, mm, 11, 6, in, 97, of, today, s, measurement, but, in, some, provinces, particularly, germania, inferior, the, so, called, pes, drusianus, foot, of, nero, claudius, drusus, was, sometimes, used, with, a, length, of, about, 334, mm, 13, 1, in, in, reality, this, foot, predated, drusus, originally, both, the, greeks, and, the, romans, subdivided, the, foot, into, 16, digits, but, in, later, years, the, romans, also, subdivided, the, foot, into, 12, unciae, from, which, both, the, english, words, inch, and, ounce, are, derived, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, some, roman, traditions, were, continued, but, others, fell, into, disuse, in, ad, 790, charlemagne, attempted, to, reform, the, units, of, measure, in, his, domains, his, units, of, length, were, based, on, the, toise, and, in, particular, the, toise, de, l, critoire, the, distance, between, the, fingertips, of, the, outstretched, arms, of, a, man, the, toise, has, 6, pieds, feet, each, of, 326, 6, mm, 12, 9, in, he, was, unsuccessful, in, introducing, a, standard, unit, of, length, throughout, his, realm, an, analysis, of, the, measurements, of, charlieu, abbey, shows, that, during, the, 9th, century, the, roman, foot, of, 296, 1, mm, 11, 66, in, was, used, when, it, was, rebuilt, in, the, 10th, century, a, foot, of, about, 320, mm, 12, 6, in, was, used, at, the, same, time, monastic, buildings, used, the, carolingian, foot, of, 340, mm, 13, 4, in, the, procedure, for, verification, of, the, foot, as, described, in, the, 16th, century, posthumously, published, work, by, jacob, k, bel, in, his, book, geometrei, von, k, nstlichem, feldmessen, und, absehen, is, stand, at, the, door, of, a, church, on, a, sunday, and, bid, 16, men, to, stop, tall, ones, and, small, ones, as, they, happen, to, pass, out, when, the, service, is, finished, then, make, them, put, their, left, feet, one, behind, the, other, and, the, length, thus, obtained, shall, be, a, right, and, lawful, rood, to, measure, and, survey, the, land, with, and, the, 16th, part, of, it, shall, be, the, right, and, lawful, foot, the, neolithic, long, foot, first, proposed, by, archeologists, mike, parker, pearson, and, andrew, chamberlain, is, based, upon, calculations, from, surveys, of, phase, 1, elements, at, stonehenge, they, found, that, the, underlying, diameters, of, the, stone, circles, had, been, consistently, laid, out, using, multiples, of, a, base, unit, amounting, to, 30, long, feet, which, they, calculated, to, be, 1, 056, of, a, modern, international, foot, thus, 12, 672, inches, or, 0, 3219, m, furthermore, this, unit, is, identifiable, in, the, dimensions, of, some, stone, lintels, at, the, site, and, in, the, diameter, of, the, southern, circle, at, nearby, durrington, walls, evidence, that, this, unit, was, in, widespread, use, across, southern, britain, is, available, from, the, folkton, drums, from, yorkshire, neolithic, artifacts, made, from, chalk, with, circumferences, that, exactly, divide, as, integers, into, ten, long, feet, and, a, similar, object, the, lavant, drum, excavated, at, lavant, sussex, again, with, a, circumference, divisible, as, a, whole, number, into, ten, long, feet, the, measures, of, iron, age, britain, are, uncertain, and, proposed, reconstructions, such, as, the, megalithic, yard, are, controversial, later, welsh, legend, credited, dyfnwal, moelmud, with, the, establishment, of, their, units, including, a, foot, of, 9, inches, the, belgic, or, north, german, foot, of, 335, mm, 13, 2, in, was, introduced, to, england, either, by, the, belgic, celts, during, their, invasions, prior, to, the, romans, or, by, the, anglo, saxons, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, century, roman, units, were, introduced, following, their, invasion, in, ad, 43, following, the, roman, withdrawal, and, saxon, invasions, the, roman, foot, continued, to, be, used, in, the, construction, crafts, while, the, belgic, foot, was, used, for, land, measurement, both, the, welsh, and, belgic, feet, seem, to, have, been, based, on, multiples, of, the, barleycorn, but, by, as, early, as, 950, the, english, kings, seem, to, have, ineffectually, ordered, measures, to, be, based, upon, an, iron, yardstick, at, winchester, and, then, london, henry, i, was, said, to, have, ordered, a, new, standard, to, be, based, upon, the, length, of, his, own, arm, and, by, the, c, 1300, act, concerning, the, composition, of, yards, and, perches, traditionally, credited, to, edward, i, or, ii, the, statute, foot, was, a, different, measure, exactly, 10, 11, of, the, old, belgic, foot, the, barleycorn, inch, ell, and, yard, were, likewise, shrunk, while, rods, and, furlongs, remained, the, same, the, ambiguity, over, the, state, of, the, mile, was, resolved, by, the, 1593, act, against, converting, of, great, houses, into, several, tenements, and, for, restraint, of, inmates, and, inclosures, in, and, near, about, the, city, of, london, and, westminster, which, codified, the, statute, mile, as, comprising, 5, 280, feet, the, differences, among, the, various, physical, standard, yards, around, the, world, revealed, by, increasingly, powerful, microscopes, eventually, led, to, the, 1959, adoption, of, the, international, foot, defined, in, terms, of, the, meter, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, july, 1959, defined, the, length, of, the, international, yard, in, the, united, states, and, countries, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, as, exactly, 0, 9144, meters, consequently, since, a, foot, is, one, third, of, a, yard, the, international, foot, is, defined, to, be, equal, to, exactly, 0, 3048, meters, this, was, 2, ppm, shorter, than, the, previous, us, definition, and, 1, 7, ppm, longer, than, the, previous, british, definition, the, 1959, agreement, concluded, a, series, of, step, by, step, events, set, off, in, particular, by, the, british, standards, institution, s, adoption, of, a, scientific, standard, inch, of, 25, 4, millimeters, in, 1930, the, ieee, standard, symbol, for, a, foot, is, ft, in, some, cases, the, foot, is, denoted, by, a, prime, often, approximated, by, an, apostrophe, and, the, inch, by, a, double, prime, for, example, 2, feet, 4, inches, is, sometimes, denoted, 2, 4, in, imperial, units, the, foot, was, defined, as, 1, 3, yard, with, the, yard, being, realized, as, a, physical, standard, separate, from, the, standard, meter, the, yard, standards, of, the, different, commonwealth, countries, were, periodically, compared, with, one, another, the, value, of, the, united, kingdom, primary, standard, of, the, yard, was, determined, in, terms, of, the, meter, by, the, national, physical, laboratory, in, 1964, to, be, 0, 914, 3969, m, implying, a, pre, 1959, uk, foot, of, 0, 304, 7990, m, the, uk, adopted, the, international, yard, for, all, purposes, through, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1963, effective, january, 1, 1964, when, the, international, foot, was, defined, in, 1959, a, great, deal, of, survey, data, was, already, available, based, on, the, former, definitions, especially, in, the, united, states, and, in, india, the, small, difference, between, the, survey, foot, and, the, international, foot, would, not, be, detectable, on, a, survey, of, a, small, parcel, but, becomes, significant, for, mapping, or, when, the, state, plane, coordinate, system, spcs, is, used, in, the, us, because, the, origin, of, the, system, may, be, hundreds, of, thousands, of, feet, hundreds, of, miles, from, the, point, of, interest, hence, the, previous, definitions, continued, to, be, used, for, surveying, in, the, united, states, and, india, for, many, years, and, are, denoted, survey, feet, to, distinguish, them, from, the, international, foot, the, united, kingdom, was, unaffected, by, this, problem, as, the, retriangulation, of, great, britain, 1936, 62, had, been, done, in, meters, in, the, united, states, the, foot, was, defined, as, 12, inches, with, the, inch, being, defined, by, the, mendenhall, order, of, 1893, via, 39, 37, inches, 1, m, making, a, us, foot, exactly, 1200, 3937, meters, approximately, 0, 304, 800, 61, m, on, december, 31, 2022, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, the, national, geodetic, survey, and, the, united, states, department, of, commerce, deprecated, use, of, the, us, survey, foot, and, recommended, conversion, to, either, the, meter, or, the, international, foot, 0, 3048, m, however, the, historic, relevance, of, the, us, survey, foot, persists, as, the, federal, register, notes, the, date, of, december, 31, 2022, was, selected, to, accompany, the, modernization, of, the, national, spatial, reference, system, nsrs, by, noaa, s, national, geodetic, survey, ngs, the, reason, for, associating, the, deprecation, of, the, u, s, survey, foot, with, the, modernization, of, the, nsrs, is, that, the, biggest, impact, of, the, uniform, adoption, of, the, international, foot, will, be, for, users, of, the, nsrs, due, to, very, large, coordinate, values, currently, given, in, u, s, survey, feet, in, many, areas, of, the, u, s, impacts, related, to, the, change, to, international, feet, will, be, minimized, if, a, transition, occurs, concurrently, with, others, changes, in, the, nsrs, the, difference, in, timelines, will, have, no, effect, on, users, of, the, existing, nsrs, national, spatial, reference, system, because, ngs, noaa, s, national, geodetic, survey, will, continue, to, support, the, u, s, survey, foot, for, components, of, the, nsrs, where, it, is, used, now, and, in, the, past, in, other, words, to, minimize, disruption, in, the, use, of, u, s, survey, foot, for, existing, nsrs, coordinate, systems, the, change, will, apply, only, to, the, modernized, nsrs, state, legislation, is, also, important, for, determining, the, conversion, factor, to, be, used, for, everyday, land, surveying, and, real, estate, transactions, although, the, difference, two, parts, per, million, is, of, no, practical, significance, given, the, precision, of, normal, surveying, measurements, over, short, distances, usually, much, less, than, a, mile, out, of, 50, states, and, six, other, jurisdictions, 40, have, legislated, that, surveying, measures, should, be, based, on, the, us, survey, foot, six, have, legislated, that, they, be, made, on, the, basis, of, the, international, foot, and, ten, have, not, specified, the, indian, survey, foot, is, defined, as, exactly, 0, 304, 7996, m, presumably, derived, from, a, measurement, of, the, previous, indian, standard, of, the, yard, the, current, national, topographic, database, of, the, survey, of, india, is, based, on, the, metric, wgs, 84, datum, which, is, also, used, by, the, global, positioning, system, an, iso, 2848, measure, of, 3, basic, modules, 30, cm, is, called, a, metric, foot, but, there, were, earlier, distinct, definitions, of, a, metric, foot, during, metrication, in, france, and, germany, in, 1799, the, meter, became, the, official, unit, of, length, in, france, this, was, not, fully, enforced, and, in, 1812, napoleon, introduced, the, system, of, mesures, usuelles, which, restored, the, traditional, french, measurements, in, the, retail, trade, but, redefined, them, in, terms, of, metric, units, the, foot, or, pied, m, trique, was, defined, as, one, third, of, a, meter, this, unit, continued, in, use, until, 1837, in, southwestern, germany, in, 1806, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, was, founded, and, three, different, reformed, feet, were, defined, all, of, which, were, based, on, the, metric, system, prior, to, the, introduction, of, the, metric, system, many, european, cities, and, countries, used, the, foot, but, it, varied, considerably, in, length, the, voet, in, ypres, belgium, was, 273, 8, millimeters, 10, 78, in, while, the, piede, in, venice, was, 347, 73, millimeters, 13, 690, in, lists, of, conversion, factors, between, the, various, units, of, measure, were, given, in, many, european, reference, works, including, many, of, these, standards, were, peculiar, to, a, particular, city, especially, in, germany, which, before, german, unification, in, 1871, consisted, of, many, kingdoms, principalities, free, cities, and, so, on, in, many, cases, the, length, of, the, unit, was, not, uniquely, fixed, for, example, the, english, foot, was, stated, as, 11, pouces, 2, 6, lignes, french, inches, and, lines, by, picard, 11, pouces, 3, 11, lignes, by, maskelyne, and, 11, pouces, 3, lignes, by, d, alembert, most, of, the, various, feet, in, this, list, ceased, to, be, used, when, the, countries, adopted, the, metric, system, the, netherlands, and, modern, belgium, adopted, the, metric, system, in, 1817, having, used, the, mesures, usuelles, under, napoleon, and, the, newly, formed, german, empire, adopted, the, metric, system, in, 1871, the, palm, typically, 200, 280, mm, ie, 7, 7, 8, to, 11, 1, 32, inches, was, used, in, many, mediterranean, cities, instead, of, the, foot, horace, doursther, whose, reference, was, published, in, belgium, which, had, the, smallest, foot, measurements, grouped, both, units, together, while, j, f, g, palaiseau, devoted, three, chapters, to, units, of, length, one, for, linear, measures, palms, and, feet, one, for, cloth, measures, ells, and, one, for, distances, traveled, miles, and, leagues, in, the, table, below, arbitrary, cut, off, points, of, 270, mm, and, 350, mm, 10, 5, 8, to, 13, 3, 4, inches, have, been, chosen, in, belgium, the, words, pied, french, and, voet, dutch, would, have, been, used, interchangeably, international, standards, organisation, iso, defined, intermodal, containers, for, efficient, global, freight, cargo, shipping, were, defined, using, feet, rather, than, meters, for, their, leading, outside, corner, dimensions, all, iso, standard, containers, to, this, day, are, eight, feet, wide, and, their, outer, heights, and, lengths, are, also, primarily, defined, in, or, derived, from, feet, quantities, of, global, shipping, containers, are, still, primarily, counted, in, twenty, foot, equivalent, units, or, teus, everyday, global, civilian, air, traffic, aviation, continues, to, be, controlled, in, flight, levels, flying, altitudes, separated, by, thousands, of, feet, although, typically, read, out, in, hundreds, e, g, flight, level, 330, actually, means, 33, 000, feet, or, about, 10, kilometres, in, altitude, the, length, of, the, international, foot, corresponds, to, a, human, foot, with, shoe, size, of, 13, uk, 14, us, male, 15, 5, us, female, or, 48, eu, sizing, in, measurement, the, term, linear, foot, sometimes, incorrectly, referred, to, as, lineal, foot, refers, to, the, number, of, feet, in, a, length, of, material, such, as, lumber, or, fabric, without, regard, to, the, width, it, is, used, to, distinguish, from, surface, area, in, square, foot
