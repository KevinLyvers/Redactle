zirconium, is, a, lustrous, transition, metal, with, a, greyish, white, color, that, closely, resembles, hafnium, and, to, a, lesser, extent, titanium, it, is, solid, at, room, temperature, ductile, malleable, and, corrosion, resistant, the, name, zirconium, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, mineral, zircon, the, most, important, source, of, zirconium, the, word, is, related, to, persian, zargun, zircon, zar, gun, gold, like, or, as, gold, besides, zircon, zirconium, occurs, in, over, 140, other, minerals, including, baddeleyite, and, eudialyte, most, zirconium, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, minerals, mined, for, titanium, and, tin, zirconium, forms, a, variety, of, inorganic, compounds, such, as, zirconium, dioxide, and, organometallic, compounds, such, as, zirconocene, dichloride, five, isotopes, occur, naturally, four, of, which, are, stable, the, metal, and, its, alloys, are, mainly, used, as, a, refractory, and, opacifier, pure, zirconium, plays, a, vital, role, in, the, construction, of, nuclear, reactors, due, to, strong, resistance, to, corrosion, and, low, nuclear, reaction, cross, section, and, in, space, vehicles, and, turbine, blades, where, high, heat, resistance, is, necessary, zirconium, also, finds, uses, in, flashbulbs, biomedical, applications, such, as, dental, implants, and, prosthetics, deodorant, and, water, purification, systems, zirconium, compounds, have, no, known, biological, role, though, the, element, is, widely, distributed, in, nature, and, appears, in, small, quantities, in, biological, systems, without, adverse, effects, there, is, no, indication, of, zirconium, as, a, carcinogen, the, main, hazards, posed, by, zirconium, are, flammability, in, powder, form, and, irritation, of, the, eyes, zirconium, is, a, lustrous, greyish, white, soft, ductile, malleable, metal, that, is, solid, at, room, temperature, though, it, is, hard, and, brittle, at, lesser, purities, in, powder, form, zirconium, is, highly, flammable, but, the, solid, form, is, much, less, prone, to, ignition, zirconium, is, highly, resistant, to, corrosion, by, alkalis, acids, salt, water, and, other, agents, however, it, will, dissolve, in, hydrochloric, and, sulfuric, acid, especially, when, fluorine, is, present, alloys, with, zinc, are, magnetic, at, less, than, 35, k, the, melting, point, of, zirconium, is, 1855, c, 3371, f, and, the, boiling, point, is, 4409, c, 7968, f, zirconium, has, an, electronegativity, of, 1, 33, on, the, pauling, scale, of, the, elements, within, the, d, block, with, known, electronegativities, zirconium, has, the, fourth, lowest, electronegativity, after, hafnium, yttrium, and, lutetium, at, room, temperature, zirconium, exhibits, a, hexagonally, close, packed, crystal, structure, zr, which, changes, to, zr, a, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, at, 863, c, zirconium, exists, in, the, phase, until, the, melting, point, naturally, occurring, zirconium, is, composed, of, five, isotopes, 90, zr, 91, zr, 92, zr, and, 94, zr, are, stable, although, 94, zr, is, predicted, to, undergo, double, beta, decay, not, observed, experimentally, with, a, half, life, of, more, than, 1, 10, 10, 17, years, 96, zr, has, a, half, life, of, 2, 34, 10, 19, years, and, is, the, longest, lived, radioisotope, of, zirconium, of, these, natural, isotopes, 90, zr, is, the, most, common, making, up, 51, 45, of, all, zirconium, 96, zr, is, the, least, common, comprising, only, 2, 80, of, zirconium, thirty, three, artificial, isotopes, of, zirconium, have, been, synthesized, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 77, to, 114, 93, zr, is, the, longest, lived, artificial, isotope, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 61, 10, 6, years, radioactive, isotopes, at, or, above, mass, number, 93, decay, by, electron, emission, whereas, those, at, or, below, 89, decay, by, positron, emission, the, only, exception, is, 88, zr, which, decays, by, electron, capture, thirteen, isotopes, of, zirconium, also, exist, as, metastable, isomers, 83m1, zr, 83m2, zr, 85m, zr, 87m, zr, 88m, zr, 89m, zr, 90m1, zr, 90m2, zr, 91m, zr, 97m, zr, 98m, zr, 99m, zr, and, 108m, zr, of, these, 97m, zr, has, the, shortest, half, life, at, 104, 8, nanoseconds, 89m, zr, is, the, longest, lived, with, a, half, life, of, 4, 161, minutes, zirconium, has, a, concentration, of, about, 130, mg, kg, within, the, earth, s, crust, and, about, 0, 026, g, l, in, sea, water, it, is, the, 18th, most, abundant, element, in, the, crust, it, is, not, found, in, nature, as, a, native, metal, reflecting, its, intrinsic, instability, with, respect, to, water, the, principal, commercial, source, of, zirconium, is, zircon, zrsio, 4, a, silicate, mineral, which, is, found, primarily, in, australia, brazil, india, russia, south, africa, and, the, united, states, as, well, as, in, smaller, deposits, around, the, world, as, of, 2013, two, thirds, of, zircon, mining, occurs, in, australia, and, south, africa, zircon, resources, exceed, 60, million, tonnes, worldwide, and, annual, worldwide, zirconium, production, is, approximately, 900, 000, tonnes, zirconium, also, occurs, in, more, than, 140, other, minerals, including, the, commercially, useful, ores, baddeleyite, and, eudialyte, zirconium, is, relatively, abundant, in, s, type, stars, and, has, been, detected, in, the, sun, and, in, meteorites, lunar, rock, samples, brought, back, from, several, apollo, missions, to, the, moon, have, a, high, zirconium, oxide, content, relative, to, terrestrial, rocks, epr, spectroscopy, has, been, used, in, investigations, of, the, unusual, 3, valence, state, of, zirconium, the, epr, spectrum, of, zr, 3, which, has, been, initially, observed, as, a, parasitic, signal, in, fe, doped, single, crystals, of, scpo, 4, was, definitively, identified, by, preparing, single, crystals, of, scpo, 4, doped, with, isotopically, enriched, 94, 6, 91, zr, single, crystals, of, lupo, 4, and, ypo, 4, doped, with, both, naturally, abundant, and, isotopically, enriched, zr, have, also, been, grown, and, investigated, zirconium, is, a, by, product, formed, after, mining, and, processing, of, the, titanium, minerals, ilmenite, and, rutile, as, well, as, tin, mining, from, 2003, to, 2007, while, prices, for, the, mineral, zircon, steadily, increased, from, 360, to, 840, per, tonne, the, price, for, unwrought, zirconium, metal, decreased, from, 39, 900, to, 22, 700, per, ton, zirconium, metal, is, much, more, expensive, than, zircon, because, the, reduction, processes, are, costly, collected, from, coastal, waters, zircon, bearing, sand, is, purified, by, spiral, concentrators, to, separate, lighter, materials, which, are, then, returned, to, the, water, because, they, are, natural, components, of, beach, sand, using, magnetic, separation, the, titanium, ores, ilmenite, and, rutile, are, removed, most, zircon, is, used, directly, in, commercial, applications, but, a, small, percentage, is, converted, to, the, metal, most, zr, metal, is, produced, by, the, reduction, of, the, zirconium, iv, chloride, with, magnesium, metal, in, the, kroll, process, the, resulting, metal, is, sintered, until, sufficiently, ductile, for, metalworking, commercial, zirconium, metal, typically, contains, 1, 3, of, hafnium, which, is, usually, not, problematic, because, the, chemical, properties, of, hafnium, and, zirconium, are, very, similar, their, neutron, absorbing, properties, differ, strongly, however, necessitating, the, separation, of, hafnium, from, zirconium, for, nuclear, reactors, several, separation, schemes, are, in, use, the, liquid, liquid, extraction, of, the, thiocyanate, oxide, derivatives, exploits, the, fact, that, the, hafnium, derivative, is, slightly, more, soluble, in, methyl, isobutyl, ketone, than, in, water, this, method, accounts, for, roughly, two, thirds, of, pure, zirconium, production, though, other, methods, are, being, researched, for, instance, in, india, a, tbp, nitrate, solvent, extraction, process, is, used, for, the, separation, of, zirconium, from, other, metals, zr, and, hf, can, also, be, separated, by, fractional, crystallization, of, potassium, hexafluorozirconate, k, 2, zrf, 6, which, is, less, soluble, in, water, than, the, analogous, hafnium, derivative, fractional, distillation, of, the, tetrachlorides, also, called, extractive, distillation, is, also, used, vacuum, arc, melting, combined, with, the, use, of, hot, extruding, techniques, and, supercooled, copper, hearths, is, capable, of, producing, zirconium, that, has, been, purified, of, oxygen, nitrogen, and, carbon, hafnium, must, be, removed, from, zirconium, for, nuclear, applications, because, hafnium, has, a, neutron, absorption, cross, section, 600, times, greater, than, zirconium, the, separated, hafnium, can, be, used, for, reactor, control, rods, like, other, transition, metals, zirconium, forms, a, wide, range, of, inorganic, compounds, and, coordination, complexes, in, general, these, compounds, are, colourless, diamagnetic, solids, wherein, zirconium, has, the, oxidation, state, 4, some, organometallic, compounds, are, considered, to, have, zr, ii, oxidation, state, non, equilibrium, oxidation, states, between, 0, and, 4, have, been, detected, during, zirconium, oxidation, the, most, common, oxide, is, zirconium, dioxide, zro, 2, also, known, as, zirconia, this, clear, to, white, coloured, solid, has, exceptional, fracture, toughness, for, a, ceramic, and, chemical, resistance, especially, in, its, cubic, form, these, properties, make, zirconia, useful, as, a, thermal, barrier, coating, although, it, is, also, a, common, diamond, substitute, zirconium, monoxide, zro, is, also, known, and, s, type, stars, are, recognised, by, detection, of, its, emission, lines, zirconium, tungstate, has, the, unusual, property, of, shrinking, in, all, dimensions, when, heated, whereas, most, other, substances, expand, when, heated, zirconyl, chloride, is, one, of, the, few, water, soluble, zirconium, complexes, with, the, formula, cl, 8, zirconium, carbide, and, zirconium, nitride, are, refractory, solids, both, are, highly, corrosion, resistant, and, find, uses, in, high, temperature, resistant, coatings, and, cutting, tools, zirconium, hydride, phases, are, known, to, form, when, zirconium, alloys, are, exposed, to, large, quantities, of, hydrogen, over, time, due, to, the, brittleness, of, zirconium, hydrides, relative, to, zirconium, alloys, the, mitigation, of, zirconium, hydride, formation, was, highly, studied, during, the, development, of, the, first, commercial, nuclear, reactors, in, which, zirconium, carbide, was, a, frequently, used, material, lead, zirconate, titanate, pzt, is, the, most, commonly, used, piezoelectric, material, being, used, as, transducers, and, actuators, in, medical, and, microelectromechanical, systems, applications, all, four, common, halides, are, known, zrf, 4, zrcl, 4, zrbr, 4, and, zri, 4, all, have, polymeric, structures, and, are, far, less, volatile, than, the, corresponding, titanium, tetrahalides, they, find, applications, in, the, formation, of, organic, complexes, such, as, zirconocene, dichloride, all, tend, to, hydrolyse, to, give, the, so, called, oxyhalides, and, dioxides, fusion, of, the, tetrahalides, with, additional, metal, gives, lower, zirconium, halides, e, g, zrcl, 3, these, adopt, a, layered, structure, conducting, within, the, layers, but, not, perpendicular, thereto, the, corresponding, tetra, alkoxides, are, also, known, unlike, the, halides, the, alkoxides, dissolve, in, nonpolar, solvents, dihydrogen, hexafluorozirconate, is, used, in, the, metal, finishing, industry, as, an, etching, agent, to, promote, paint, adhesion, organozirconium, chemistry, is, key, to, ziegler, natta, catalysts, used, to, produce, polypropylene, this, application, exploits, the, ability, of, zirconium, to, reversibly, form, bonds, to, carbon, zirconocene, dibromide, c, 5, h, 5, 2, zrbr, 2, reported, in, 1952, by, birmingham, and, wilkinson, was, the, first, organozirconium, compound, schwartz, s, reagent, prepared, in, 1970, by, p, c, wailes, and, h, weigold, is, a, metallocene, used, in, organic, synthesis, for, transformations, of, alkenes, and, alkynes, many, complexes, of, zr, ii, are, derivatives, of, zirconocene, one, example, being, c, 5, me, 5, 2, zr, co, 2, the, zirconium, containing, mineral, zircon, and, related, minerals, jargoon, jacinth, or, hyacinth, ligure, were, mentioned, in, biblical, writings, the, mineral, was, not, known, to, contain, a, new, element, until, 1789, when, klaproth, analyzed, a, jargoon, from, the, island, of, ceylon, now, sri, lanka, he, named, the, new, element, zirkonerde, zirconia, related, to, the, persian, zargun, zircon, zar, gun, gold, like, or, as, gold, humphry, davy, attempted, to, isolate, this, new, element, in, 1808, through, electrolysis, but, failed, zirconium, metal, was, first, obtained, in, an, impure, form, in, 1824, by, berzelius, by, heating, a, mixture, of, potassium, and, potassium, zirconium, fluoride, in, an, iron, tube, the, crystal, bar, process, also, known, as, the, iodide, process, discovered, by, anton, eduard, van, arkel, and, jan, hendrik, de, boer, in, 1925, was, the, first, industrial, process, for, the, commercial, production, of, metallic, zirconium, it, involves, the, formation, and, subsequent, thermal, decomposition, of, zirconium, tetraiodide, zri, 4, and, was, superseded, in, 1945, by, the, much, cheaper, kroll, process, developed, by, william, justin, kroll, in, which, zirconium, tetrachloride, zrcl, 4, is, reduced, by, magnesium, zrcl, 4, 2, mg, zr, 2, mgcl, 2, displaystyle, ce, zrcl4, 2mg, zr, 2mgcl2, approximately, 900, 000, tonnes, of, zirconium, ores, were, mined, in, 1995, mostly, as, zircon, most, zircon, is, used, directly, in, high, temperature, applications, because, it, is, refractory, hard, and, resistant, to, chemical, attack, zircon, finds, many, applications, its, main, use, is, as, an, opacifier, conferring, a, white, opaque, appearance, to, ceramic, materials, because, of, its, chemical, resistance, zircon, is, also, used, in, aggressive, environments, such, as, moulds, for, molten, metals, zirconium, dioxide, zro, 2, is, used, in, laboratory, crucibles, in, metallurgical, furnaces, and, as, a, refractory, material, because, it, is, mechanically, strong, and, flexible, it, can, be, sintered, into, ceramic, knives, and, other, blades, zircon, zrsio, 4, and, cubic, zirconia, zro, 2, are, cut, into, gemstones, for, use, in, jewelry, zirconium, dioxide, is, a, component, in, some, abrasives, such, as, grinding, wheels, and, sandpaper, zircon, is, also, used, in, dating, of, rocks, from, about, the, time, of, the, earth, s, formation, through, the, measurement, of, its, inherent, radioisotopes, most, often, uranium, and, lead, a, small, fraction, of, the, zircon, is, converted, to, the, metal, which, finds, various, niche, applications, because, of, zirconium, s, excellent, resistance, to, corrosion, it, is, often, used, as, an, alloying, agent, in, materials, that, are, exposed, to, aggressive, environments, such, as, surgical, appliances, light, filaments, and, watch, cases, the, high, reactivity, of, zirconium, with, oxygen, at, high, temperatures, is, exploited, in, some, specialised, applications, such, as, explosive, primers, and, as, getters, in, vacuum, tubes, the, same, property, is, probably, the, purpose, of, including, zr, nanoparticles, as, pyrophoric, material, in, explosive, weapons, such, as, the, blu, 97, b, combined, effects, bomb, burning, zirconium, was, used, as, a, light, source, in, some, photographic, flashbulbs, zirconium, powder, with, a, mesh, size, from, 10, to, 80, is, occasionally, used, in, pyrotechnic, compositions, to, generate, sparks, the, high, reactivity, of, zirconium, leads, to, bright, white, sparks, cladding, for, nuclear, reactor, fuels, consumes, about, 1, of, the, zirconium, supply, mainly, in, the, form, of, zircaloys, the, desired, properties, of, these, alloys, are, a, low, neutron, capture, cross, section, and, resistance, to, corrosion, under, normal, service, conditions, efficient, methods, for, removing, the, hafnium, impurities, were, developed, to, serve, this, purpose, one, disadvantage, of, zirconium, alloys, is, the, reactivity, with, water, producing, hydrogen, leading, to, degradation, of, the, fuel, rod, cladding, zr, 2, h, 2, o, zro, 2, 2, h, 2, displaystyle, ce, zr, 2h2o, zro2, 2h2, hydrolysis, is, very, slow, below, 100, c, but, rapid, at, temperature, above, 900, c, most, metals, undergo, similar, reactions, the, redox, reaction, is, relevant, to, the, instability, of, fuel, assemblies, at, high, temperatures, this, reaction, occurred, in, the, reactors, 1, 2, and, 3, of, the, fukushima, i, nuclear, power, plant, japan, after, the, reactor, cooling, was, interrupted, by, the, earthquake, and, tsunami, disaster, of, march, 11, 2011, leading, to, the, fukushima, i, nuclear, accidents, after, venting, the, hydrogen, in, the, maintenance, hall, of, those, three, reactors, the, mixture, of, hydrogen, with, atmospheric, oxygen, exploded, severely, damaging, the, installations, and, at, least, one, of, the, containment, buildings, zirconium, is, a, constituent, of, uranium, zirconium, hydrides, nuclear, fuels, used, in, research, reactors, materials, fabricated, from, zirconium, metal, and, zro, 2, are, used, in, space, vehicles, where, resistance, to, heat, is, needed, high, temperature, parts, such, as, combustors, blades, and, vanes, in, jet, engines, and, stationary, gas, turbines, are, increasingly, being, protected, by, thin, ceramic, layers, and, or, paintable, coatings, usually, composed, of, a, mixture, of, zirconia, and, yttria, zirconium, is, also, used, as, a, material, of, first, choice, for, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, tanks, propellant, lines, valves, and, thrusters, in, propulsion, space, systems, such, as, these, equipping, the, sierra, space, s, dream, chaser, spaceplane, where, the, thrust, is, provided, by, the, combustion, of, kerosene, and, hydrogen, peroxide, a, powerful, but, unstable, oxidizer, the, reason, is, that, zirconium, has, an, excellent, corrosion, resistance, to, h, 2, o, 2, and, above, all, do, not, catalyse, its, spontaneous, self, decomposition, as, the, ions, of, many, transition, metals, do, zirconium, bearing, compounds, are, used, in, many, biomedical, applications, including, dental, implants, and, crowns, knee, and, hip, replacements, middle, ear, ossicular, chain, reconstruction, and, other, restorative, and, prosthetic, devices, zirconium, binds, urea, a, property, that, has, been, utilized, extensively, to, the, benefit, of, patients, with, chronic, kidney, disease, for, example, zirconium, is, a, primary, component, of, the, sorbent, column, dependent, dialysate, regeneration, and, recirculation, system, known, as, the, redy, system, which, was, first, introduced, in, 1973, more, than, 2, 000, 000, dialysis, treatments, have, been, performed, using, the, sorbent, column, in, the, redy, system, although, the, redy, system, was, superseded, in, the, 1990s, by, less, expensive, alternatives, new, sorbent, based, dialysis, systems, are, being, evaluated, and, approved, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, renal, solutions, developed, the, dialisorb, technology, a, portable, low, water, dialysis, system, also, developmental, versions, of, a, wearable, artificial, kidney, have, incorporated, sorbent, based, technologies, sodium, zirconium, cyclosilicate, is, used, by, mouth, in, the, treatment, of, hyperkalemia, it, is, a, selective, sorbent, designed, to, trap, potassium, ions, in, preference, to, other, ions, throughout, the, gastrointestinal, tract, mixtures, of, monomeric, and, polymeric, zr, 4, and, al, 3, complexes, with, hydroxide, chloride, and, glycine, called, aluminium, zirconium, glycine, salts, are, used, in, a, preparation, as, an, antiperspirant, in, many, deodorant, products, it, has, been, used, since, the, early, 1960s, as, it, was, determined, more, efficacious, as, an, antiperspirant, than, contemporary, active, ingredients, such, as, aluminium, chlorohydrate, zirconium, carbonate, 3zro, 2, co, 2, h, 2, o, was, used, in, lotions, to, treat, poison, ivy, but, was, discontinued, because, it, occasionally, caused, skin, reactions, although, zirconium, has, no, known, biological, role, the, human, body, contains, on, average, 250, milligrams, of, zirconium, and, daily, intake, is, approximately, 4, 15, milligrams, 3, 5, milligrams, from, food, and, 0, 65, milligrams, from, water, depending, on, dietary, habits, zirconium, is, widely, distributed, in, nature, and, is, found, in, all, biological, systems, for, example, 2, 86, g, g, in, whole, wheat, 3, 09, g, g, in, brown, rice, 0, 55, g, g, in, spinach, 1, 23, g, g, in, eggs, and, 0, 86, g, g, in, ground, beef, further, zirconium, is, commonly, used, in, commercial, products, e, g, deodorant, sticks, aerosol, antiperspirants, and, also, in, water, purification, e, g, control, of, phosphorus, pollution, bacteria, and, pyrogen, contaminated, water, short, term, exposure, to, zirconium, powder, can, cause, irritation, but, only, contact, with, the, eyes, requires, medical, attention, persistent, exposure, to, zirconium, tetrachloride, results, in, increased, mortality, in, rats, and, guinea, pigs, and, a, decrease, of, blood, hemoglobin, and, red, blood, cells, in, dogs, however, in, a, study, of, 20, rats, given, a, standard, diet, containing, 4, zirconium, oxide, there, were, no, adverse, effects, on, growth, rate, blood, and, urine, parameters, or, mortality, the, u, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, zirconium, exposure, is, 5, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, is, 5, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, and, a, short, term, limit, of, 10, mg, m, 3, at, levels, of, 25, mg, m, 3, zirconium, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, however, zirconium, is, not, considered, an, industrial, health, hazard, furthermore, reports, of, zirconium, related, adverse, reactions, are, rare, and, in, general, rigorous, cause, and, effect, relationships, have, not, been, established, no, evidence, has, been, validated, that, zirconium, is, carcinogenic, or, genotoxic, among, the, numerous, radioactive, isotopes, of, zirconium, 93, zr, is, among, the, most, common, it, is, released, as, a, product, of, nuclear, fission, of, 235, u, and, 239, pu, mainly, in, nuclear, power, plants, and, during, nuclear, weapons, tests, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, it, has, a, very, long, half, life, 1, 53, million, years, its, decay, emits, only, low, energy, radiations, and, it, is, not, considered, particularly, hazardous
