flux, describes, any, effect, that, appears, to, pass, or, travel, whether, it, actually, moves, or, not, through, a, surface, or, substance, flux, is, a, concept, in, applied, mathematics, and, vector, calculus, which, has, many, applications, to, physics, for, transport, phenomena, flux, is, a, vector, quantity, describing, the, magnitude, and, direction, of, the, flow, of, a, substance, or, property, in, vector, calculus, flux, is, a, scalar, quantity, defined, as, the, surface, integral, of, the, perpendicular, component, of, a, vector, field, over, a, surface, the, word, flux, comes, from, latin, fluxus, means, flow, and, fluere, is, to, flow, as, fluxion, this, term, was, introduced, into, differential, calculus, by, isaac, newton, the, concept, of, heat, flux, was, a, key, contribution, of, joseph, fourier, in, the, analysis, of, heat, transfer, phenomena, his, seminal, treatise, th, orie, analytique, de, la, chaleur, the, analytical, theory, of, heat, defines, fluxion, as, a, central, quantity, and, proceeds, to, derive, the, now, well, known, expressions, of, flux, in, terms, of, temperature, differences, across, a, slab, and, then, more, generally, in, terms, of, temperature, gradients, or, differentials, of, temperature, across, other, geometries, one, could, argue, based, on, the, work, of, james, clerk, maxwell, that, the, transport, definition, precedes, the, definition, of, flux, used, in, electromagnetism, the, specific, quote, from, maxwell, is, in, the, case, of, fluxes, we, have, to, take, the, integral, over, a, surface, of, the, flux, through, every, element, of, the, surface, the, result, of, this, operation, is, called, the, surface, integral, of, the, flux, it, represents, the, quantity, which, passes, through, the, surface, according, to, the, transport, definition, flux, may, be, a, single, vector, or, it, may, be, a, vector, field, function, of, position, in, the, latter, case, flux, can, readily, be, integrated, over, a, surface, by, contrast, according, to, the, electromagnetism, definition, flux, is, the, integral, over, a, surface, it, makes, no, sense, to, integrate, a, second, definition, flux, for, one, would, be, integrating, over, a, surface, twice, thus, maxwell, s, quote, only, makes, sense, if, flux, is, being, used, according, to, the, transport, definition, and, furthermore, is, a, vector, field, rather, than, single, vector, this, is, ironic, because, maxwell, was, one, of, the, major, developers, of, what, we, now, call, electric, flux, and, magnetic, flux, according, to, the, electromagnetism, definition, their, names, in, accordance, with, the, quote, and, transport, definition, would, be, surface, integral, of, electric, flux, and, surface, integral, of, magnetic, flux, in, which, case, electric, flux, would, instead, be, defined, as, electric, field, and, magnetic, flux, defined, as, magnetic, field, this, implies, that, maxwell, conceived, of, these, fields, as, flows, fluxes, of, some, sort, given, a, flux, according, to, the, electromagnetism, definition, the, corresponding, flux, density, if, that, term, is, used, refers, to, its, derivative, along, the, surface, that, was, integrated, by, the, fundamental, theorem, of, calculus, the, corresponding, flux, density, is, a, flux, according, to, the, transport, definition, given, a, current, such, as, electric, current, charge, per, time, current, density, would, also, be, a, flux, according, to, the, transport, definition, charge, per, time, per, area, due, to, the, conflicting, definitions, of, flux, and, the, interchangeability, of, flux, flow, and, current, in, nontechnical, english, all, of, the, terms, used, in, this, paragraph, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, and, ambiguously, concrete, fluxes, in, the, rest, of, this, article, will, be, used, in, accordance, to, their, broad, acceptance, in, the, literature, regardless, of, which, definition, of, flux, the, term, corresponds, to, in, transport, phenomena, heat, transfer, mass, transfer, and, fluid, dynamics, flux, is, defined, as, the, rate, of, flow, of, a, property, per, unit, area, which, has, the, dimensions, 1, 1, the, area, is, of, the, surface, the, property, is, flowing, through, or, across, for, example, the, amount, of, water, that, flows, through, a, cross, section, of, a, river, each, second, divided, by, the, area, of, that, cross, section, or, the, amount, of, sunlight, energy, that, lands, on, a, patch, of, ground, each, second, divided, by, the, area, of, the, patch, are, kinds, of, flux, here, are, 3, definitions, in, increasing, order, of, complexity, each, is, a, special, case, of, the, following, in, all, cases, the, frequent, symbol, j, or, j, is, used, for, flux, q, for, the, physical, quantity, that, flows, t, for, time, and, a, for, area, these, identifiers, will, be, written, in, bold, when, and, only, when, they, are, vectors, first, flux, as, a, single, scalar, j, i, a, displaystyle, j, frac, i, a, where, i, lim, t, 0, q, t, d, q, d, t, displaystyle, i, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, q, delta, t, frac, mathrm, d, q, mathrm, d, t, in, this, case, the, surface, in, which, flux, is, being, measured, is, fixed, and, has, area, a, the, surface, is, assumed, to, be, flat, and, the, flow, is, assumed, to, be, everywhere, constant, with, respect, to, position, and, perpendicular, to, the, surface, second, flux, as, a, scalar, field, defined, along, a, surface, i, e, a, function, of, points, on, the, surface, j, p, i, a, p, displaystyle, j, mathbf,

flat, and, the, flow, is, assumed, to, be, everywhere, perpendicular, to, it, however, the, flow, need, not, be, constant, q, is, now, a, function, of, p, a, point, on, the, surface, and, a, an, area, rather, than, measure, the, total, flow, through, the, surface, q, measures, the, flow, through, the, disk, with, area, a, centered, at, p, along, the, surface, finally, flux, as, a, vector, field, j, p, i, a, p, displaystyle, mathbf, j, mathbf, p, frac, partial, mathbf, i, partial, a, mathbf, p, i, a, p, a, r, g, m, a, x, n, n, p, d, q, d, t, a, p, n, displaystyle, mathbf, i, a, mathbf, p, underset, mathbf, hat, n, operatorname, arg, max, mathbf, hat, n, mathbf, p, frac, mathrm, d, q, mathrm, d, t, a, mathbf, p, mathbf, hat, n, in, this, case, there, is, no, fixed, surface, we, are, measuring, over, q, is, a, function, of, a, point, an, area, and, a, direction, given, by, a, unit, vector, n, displaystyle, mathbf, hat, n, and, measures, the, flow, through, the, disk, of, area, a, perpendicular, to, that, unit, vector, i, is, defined, picking, the, unit, vector, that, maximizes, the, flow, around, the, point, because, the, true, flow, is, maximized, across, the, disk, that, is, perpendicular, to, it, the, unit, vector, thus, uniquely, maximizes, the, function, when, it, points, in, the, true, direction, of, the, flow, strictly, speaking, this, is, an, abuse, of, notation, because, the, arg, max, cannot, directly, compare, vectors, we, take, the, vector, with, the, biggest, norm, instead, these, direct, definitions, especially, the, last, are, rather, unwieldy, for, example, the, arg, max, construction, is, artificial, from, the, perspective, of, empirical, measurements, when, with, a, weathervane, or, similar, one, can, easily, deduce, the, direction, of, flux, at, a, point, rather, than, defining, the, vector, flux, directly, it, is, often, more, intuitive, to, state, some, properties, about, it, furthermore, from, these, properties, the, flux, can, uniquely, be, determined, anyway, if, the, flux, j, passes, through, the, area, at, an, angle, to, the, area, normal, n, displaystyle, mathbf, hat, n, then, the, dot, product, j, n, j, cos, displaystyle, mathbf, j, cdot, mathbf, hat, n, j, cos, theta, that, is, the, component, of, flux, passing, through, the, surface, i, e, normal, to, it, is, j, cos, while, the, component, of, flux, passing, tangential, to, the, area, is, j, sin, but, there, is, no, flux, actually, passing, through, the, area, in, the, tangential, direction, the, only, component, of, flux, passing, normal, to, the, area, is, the, cosine, component, for, vector, flux, the, surface, integral, of, j, over, a, surface, s, gives, the, proper, flowing, per, unit, of, time, through, the, surface, d, q, d, t, s, j,

vector, area, combination, a, a, n, displaystyle, mathbf, a, a, mathbf, hat, n, of, the, magnitude, of, the, area, a, through, which, the, property, passes, and, a, unit, vector, n, displaystyle, mathbf, hat, n, normal, to, the, area, unlike, in, the, second, set, of, equations, the, surface, here, need, not, be, flat, finally, we, can, integrate, again, over, the, time, duration, t, 1, to, t, 2, getting, the, total, amount, of, the, property, flowing, through, the, surface, in, that, time, t, 2, t, 1, q, t, 1, t, 2, s, j, d, a, d, t, displaystyle, q, int, t, 1, t, 2, iint, s, mathbf, j,

and, have, a, definite, magnitude, and, direction, also, one, can, take, the, divergence, of, any, of, these, fluxes, to, determine, the, accumulation, rate, of, the, quantity, in, a, control, volume, around, a, given, point, in, space, for, incompressible, flow, the, divergence, of, the, volume, flux, is, zero, as, mentioned, above, chemical, molar, flux, of, a, component, a, in, an, isothermal, isobaric, system, is, defined, in, fick, s, law, of, diffusion, as, j, a, d, a, b, c, a, displaystyle, mathbf, j, a, d, ab, nabla, c, a, where, the, nabla, symbol, denotes, the, gradient, operator, d, ab, is, the, diffusion, coefficient, m, 2, s, 1, of, component, a, diffusing, through, component, b, c, a, is, the, concentration, mol, m, 3, of, component, a, this, flux, has, units, of, mol, m, 2, s, 1, and, fits, maxwell, s, original, definition, of, flux, for, dilute, gases, kinetic, molecular, theory, relates, the, diffusion, coefficient, d, to, the, particle, density, n, n, v, the, molecular, mass, m, the, collision, cross, section, displaystyle, sigma, and, the, absolute, temperature, t, by, d, 2, 3, n, k, t, m, displaystyle, d, frac, 2, 3n, sigma, sqrt, frac, kt, pi, m, where, the, second, factor, is, the, mean, free, path, and, the, square, root, with, the, boltzmann, constant, k, is, the, mean, velocity, of, the, particles, in, turbulent, flows, the, transport, by, eddy, motion, can, be, expressed, as, a, grossly, increased, diffusion, coefficient, in, quantum, mechanics, particles, of, mass, m, in, the, quantum, state, r, t, have, a, probability, density, defined, as, 2, displaystyle, rho, psi, psi, psi, 2, so, the, probability, of, finding, a, particle, in, a, differential, volume, element, d, 3, r, is, d, p, 2, d, 3, r, displaystyle, dp, psi, 2, d, 3, mathbf,

hbar, 2m, left, psi, nabla, psi, psi, nabla, psi, right, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, probability, current, or, current, density, or, probability, flux, density, as, a, mathematical, concept, flux, is, represented, by, the, surface, integral, of, a, vector, field, where, f, is, a, vector, field, and, d, a, is, the, vector, area, of, the, surface, a, directed, as, the, surface, normal, for, the, second, n, is, the, outward, pointed, unit, normal, vector, to, the, surface, the, surface, has, to, be, orientable, i, e, two, sides, can, be, distinguished, the, surface, does, not, fold, back, onto, itself, also, the, surface, has, to, be, actually, oriented, i, e, we, use, a, convention, as, to, flowing, which, way, is, counted, positive, flowing, backward, is, then, counted, negative, the, surface, normal, is, usually, directed, by, the, right, hand, rule, conversely, one, can, consider, the, flux, the, more, fundamental, quantity, and, call, the, vector, field, the, flux, density, often, a, vector, field, is, drawn, by, curves, field, lines, following, the, flow, the, magnitude, of, the, vector, field, is, then, the, line, density, and, the, flux, through, a, surface, is, the, number, of, lines, lines, originate, from, areas, of, positive, divergence, sources, and, end, at, areas, of, negative, divergence, sinks, see, also, the, image, at, right, the, number, of, red, arrows, passing, through, a, unit, area, is, the, flux, density, the, curve, encircling, the, red, arrows, denotes, the, boundary, of, the, surface, and, the, orientation, of, the, arrows, with, respect, to, the, surface, denotes, the, sign, of, the, inner, product, of, the, vector, field, with, the, surface, normals, if, the, surface, encloses, a, 3d, region, usually, the, surface, is, oriented, such, that, the, influx, is, counted, positive, the, opposite, is, the, outflux, the, divergence, theorem, states, that, the, net, outflux, through, a, closed, surface, in, other, words, the, net, outflux, from, a, 3d, region, is, found, by, adding, the, local, net, outflow, from, each, point, in, the, region, which, is, expressed, by, the, divergence, if, the, surface, is, not, closed, it, has, an, oriented, curve, as, boundary, stokes, theorem, states, that, the, flux, of, the, curl, of, a, vector, field, is, the, line, integral, of, the, vector, field, over, this, boundary, this, path, integral, is, also, called, circulation, especially, in, fluid, dynamics, thus, the, curl, is, the, circulation, density, we, can, apply, the, flux, and, these, theorems, to, many, disciplines, in, which, we, see, currents, forces, etc, applied, through, areas, an, electric, charge, such, as, a, single, proton, in, space, has, a, magnitude, defined, in, coulombs, such, a, charge, has, an, electric, field, surrounding, it, in, pictorial, form, the, electric, field, from, a, positive, point, charge, can, be, visualized, as, a, dot, radiating, electric, field, lines, sometimes, also, called, lines, of, force, conceptually, electric, flux, can, be, thought, of, as, the, number, of, field, lines, passing, through, a, given, area, mathematically, electric, flux, is, the, integral, of, the, normal, component, of, the, electric, field, over, a, given, area, hence, units, of, electric, flux, are, in, the, mks, system, newtons, per, coulomb, times, meters, squared, or, n, m, 2, c, electric, flux, density, is, the, electric, flux, per, unit, area, and, is, a, measure, of, strength, of, the, normal, component, of, the, electric, field, averaged, over, the, area, of, integration, its, units, are, n, c, the, same, as, the, electric, field, in, mks, units, two, forms, of, electric, flux, are, used, one, for, the, e, field, and, one, for, the, d, field, called, the, electric, displacement, this, quantity, arises, in, gauss, s, law, which, states, that, the, flux, of, the, electric, field, e, out, of, a, closed, surface, is, proportional, to, the, electric, charge, q, a, enclosed, in, the, surface, independent, of, how, that, charge, is, distributed, the, integral, form, is, where, 0, is, the, permittivity, of, free, space, if, one, considers, the, flux, of, the, electric, field, vector, e, for, a, tube, near, a, point, charge, in, the, field, of, the, charge, but, not, containing, it, with, sides, formed, by, lines, tangent, to, the, field, the, flux, for, the, sides, is, zero, and, there, is, an, equal, and, opposite, flux, at, both, ends, of, the, tube, this, is, a, consequence, of, gauss, s, law, applied, to, an, inverse, square, field, the, flux, for, any, cross, sectional, surface, of, the, tube, will, be, the, same, the, total, flux, for, any, surface, surrounding, a, charge, q, is, q, 0, in, free, space, the, electric, displacement, is, given, by, the, constitutive, relation, d, 0, e, so, for, any, bounding, surface, the, d, field, flux, equals, the, charge, q, a, within, it, here, the, expression, flux, of, indicates, a, mathematical, operation, and, as, can, be, seen, the, result, is, not, necessarily, a, flow, since, nothing, actually, flows, along, electric, field, lines, the, magnetic, flux, density, magnetic, field, having, the, unit, wb, m, 2, tesla, is, denoted, by, b, and, magnetic, flux, is, defined, analogously, with, the, same, notation, above, the, quantity, arises, in, faraday, s, law, of, induction, where, the, magnetic, flux, is, time, dependent, either, because, the, boundary, is, time, dependent, or, magnetic, field, is, time, dependent, in, integral, form, where, d, is, an, infinitesimal, vector, line, element, of, the, closed, curve, a, displaystyle, partial, a, with, magnitude, equal, to, the, length, of, the, infinitesimal, line, element, and, direction, given, by, the, tangent, to, the, curve, a, displaystyle, partial, a, with, the, sign, determined, by, the, integration, direction, the, time, rate, of, change, of, the, magnetic, flux, through, a, loop, of, wire, is, minus, the, electromotive, force, created, in, that, wire, the, direction, is, such, that, if, current, is, allowed, to, pass, through, the, wire, the, electromotive, force, will, cause, a, current, which, opposes, the, change, in, magnetic, field, by, itself, producing, a, magnetic, field, opposite, to, the, change, this, is, the, basis, for, inductors, and, many, electric, generators, using, this, definition, the, flux, of, the, poynting, vector, s, over, a, specified, surface, is, the, rate, at, which, electromagnetic, energy, flows, through, that, surface, defined, like, before, the, flux, of, the, poynting, vector, through, a, surface, is, the, electromagnetic, power, or, energy, per, unit, time, passing, through, that, surface, this, is, commonly, used, in, analysis, of, electromagnetic, radiation, but, has, application, to, other, electromagnetic, systems, as, well, confusingly, the, poynting, vector, is, sometimes, called, the, power, flux, which, is, an, example, of, the, first, usage, of, flux, above, it, has, units, of, watts, per, square, metre, w, m, 2
