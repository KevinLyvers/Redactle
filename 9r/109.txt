pluto, minor, planet, designation, 134340, pluto, is, a, dwarf, planet, in, the, kuiper, belt, a, ring, of, bodies, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, it, is, the, ninth, largest, and, tenth, most, massive, known, object, to, directly, orbit, the, sun, it, is, the, largest, known, trans, neptunian, object, by, volume, by, a, small, margin, but, is, less, massive, than, eris, like, other, kuiper, belt, objects, pluto, is, made, primarily, of, ice, and, rock, and, is, much, smaller, than, the, inner, planets, pluto, has, roughly, one, sixth, the, mass, of, the, moon, and, one, third, its, volume, pluto, has, a, moderately, eccentric, and, inclined, orbit, ranging, from, 30, to, 49, astronomical, units, 4, 5, to, 7, 3, billion, kilometres, 2, 8, to, 4, 6, billion, miles, from, the, sun, light, from, the, sun, takes, 5, 5, hours, to, reach, pluto, at, its, orbital, distance, of, 39, 5, au, 5, 91, billion, km, 3, 67, billion, mi, pluto, s, eccentric, orbit, periodically, brings, it, closer, to, the, sun, than, neptune, but, a, stable, orbital, resonance, prevents, them, from, colliding, pluto, has, five, known, moons, charon, the, largest, whose, diameter, is, just, over, half, that, of, pluto, styx, nix, kerberos, and, hydra, pluto, and, charon, are, sometimes, considered, a, binary, system, because, the, barycenter, of, their, orbits, does, not, lie, within, either, body, and, they, are, tidally, locked, new, horizons, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, visit, pluto, and, its, moons, making, a, flyby, on, july, 14, 2015, and, taking, detailed, measurements, and, observations, pluto, was, discovered, in, 1930, by, clyde, w, tombaugh, making, it, by, far, the, first, known, object, in, the, kuiper, belt, it, was, immediately, hailed, as, the, ninth, planet, but, it, was, always, the, odd, object, out, 27, and, its, planetary, status, was, questioned, when, it, was, found, to, be, much, smaller, than, expected, these, doubts, increased, following, the, discovery, of, additional, objects, in, the, kuiper, belt, starting, in, the, 1990s, and, particularly, the, more, massive, scattered, disk, object, eris, in, 2005, in, 2006, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, formally, redefined, the, term, planet, to, exclude, dwarf, planets, such, as, pluto, many, planetary, astronomers, however, continue, to, consider, pluto, and, other, dwarf, planets, to, be, planets, in, the, 1840s, urbain, le, verrier, used, newtonian, mechanics, to, predict, the, position, of, the, then, undiscovered, planet, neptune, after, analyzing, perturbations, in, the, orbit, of, uranus, subsequent, observations, of, neptune, in, the, late, 19th, century, led, astronomers, to, speculate, that, uranus, s, orbit, was, being, disturbed, by, another, planet, besides, neptune, in, 1906, percival, lowell, a, wealthy, bostonian, who, had, founded, lowell, observatory, in, flagstaff, arizona, in, 1894, started, an, extensive, project, in, search, of, a, possible, ninth, planet, which, he, termed, planet, x, by, 1909, lowell, and, william, h, pickering, had, suggested, several, possible, celestial, coordinates, for, such, a, planet, lowell, and, his, observatory, conducted, his, search, using, mathematical, calculations, made, by, elizabeth, williams, until, his, death, in, 1916, but, to, no, avail, unknown, to, lowell, his, surveys, had, captured, two, faint, images, of, pluto, on, march, 19, and, april, 7, 1915, but, they, were, not, recognized, for, what, they, were, there, are, fourteen, other, known, precovery, observations, with, the, earliest, made, by, the, yerkes, observatory, on, august, 20, 1909, percival, s, widow, constance, lowell, entered, into, a, ten, year, legal, battle, with, the, lowell, observatory, over, her, husband, s, legacy, and, the, search, for, planet, x, did, not, resume, until, 1929, vesto, melvin, slipher, the, observatory, director, gave, the, job, of, locating, planet, x, to, 23, year, old, clyde, tombaugh, who, had, just, arrived, at, the, observatory, after, slipher, had, been, impressed, by, a, sample, of, his, astronomical, drawings, tombaugh, s, task, was, to, systematically, image, the, night, sky, in, pairs, of, photographs, then, examine, each, pair, and, determine, whether, any, objects, had, shifted, position, using, a, blink, comparator, he, rapidly, shifted, back, and, forth, between, views, of, each, of, the, plates, to, create, the, illusion, of, movement, of, any, objects, that, had, changed, position, or, appearance, between, photographs, on, february, 18, 1930, after, nearly, a, year, of, searching, tombaugh, discovered, a, possible, moving, object, on, photographic, plates, taken, on, january, 23, and, 29, a, lesser, quality, photograph, taken, on, january, 21, helped, confirm, the, movement, after, the, observatory, obtained, further, confirmatory, photographs, news, of, the, discovery, was, telegraphed, to, the, harvard, college, observatory, on, march, 13, 1930, one, plutonian, year, corresponds, to, 247, 94, earth, years, thus, in, 2178, pluto, will, complete, its, first, orbit, since, its, discovery, the, name, pluto, came, from, the, roman, god, of, the, underworld, and, it, is, also, an, epithet, for, hades, the, greek, equivalent, of, pluto, upon, the, announcement, of, the, discovery, lowell, observatory, received, over, a, thousand, suggestions, for, names, three, names, topped, the, list, minerva, pluto, and, cronus, minerva, was, the, lowell, staff, s, first, choice, but, was, rejected, because, it, had, already, been, used, for, an, asteroid, cronus, was, disfavored, because, it, was, promoted, by, an, unpopular, and, egocentric, astronomer, thomas, jefferson, jackson, see, a, vote, was, then, taken, and, pluto, was, the, unanimous, choice, to, make, sure, the, name, stuck, and, that, the, planet, would, not, suffer, changes, in, its, name, as, uranus, had, lowell, observatory, proposed, the, name, to, the, american, astronomical, society, and, the, royal, astronomical, society, both, approved, it, unanimously, 136, the, name, was, published, on, may, 1, 1930, the, name, pluto, had, received, some, 150, nominations, among, the, letters, and, telegrams, sent, to, lowell, the, first, had, been, from, venetia, burney, 1918, 2009, an, eleven, year, old, schoolgirl, in, oxford, england, who, was, interested, in, classical, mythology, she, had, suggested, it, to, her, grandfather, falconer, madan, when, he, read, the, news, of, pluto, s, discovery, to, his, family, over, breakfast, madan, passed, the, suggestion, to, astronomy, professor, herbert, hall, turner, who, cabled, it, to, colleagues, at, lowell, on, march, 16, three, days, after, the, announcement, the, name, pluto, was, mythologically, appropriate, the, god, pluto, was, one, of, six, surviving, children, of, saturn, and, the, others, had, already, all, been, chosen, as, names, of, major, or, minor, planets, his, brothers, jupiter, and, neptune, and, his, sisters, ceres, juno, and, vesta, both, the, god, and, the, planet, inhabited, gloomy, regions, and, the, god, was, able, to, make, himself, invisible, as, the, planet, had, been, for, so, long, the, choice, was, further, helped, by, the, fact, that, the, first, two, letters, of, pluto, were, the, initials, of, percival, lowell, indeed, percival, had, been, one, of, the, more, popular, suggestions, for, a, name, for, the, new, planet, pluto, s, planetary, symbol, was, then, created, as, a, monogram, of, the, letters, pl, this, symbol, is, rarely, used, in, astronomy, anymore, though, it, is, still, common, in, astrology, however, the, most, common, astrological, symbol, for, pluto, occasionally, used, in, astronomy, as, well, is, an, orb, possibly, representing, pluto, s, invisibility, cap, over, pluto, s, bident, which, dates, to, the, early, 1930s, the, name, pluto, was, soon, embraced, by, wider, culture, in, 1930, walt, disney, was, apparently, inspired, by, it, when, he, introduced, for, mickey, mouse, a, canine, companion, named, pluto, although, disney, animator, ben, sharpsteen, could, not, confirm, why, the, name, was, given, in, 1941, glenn, t, seaborg, named, the, newly, created, element, plutonium, after, pluto, in, keeping, with, the, tradition, of, naming, elements, after, newly, discovered, planets, following, uranium, which, was, named, after, uranus, and, neptunium, which, was, named, after, neptune, most, languages, use, the, name, pluto, in, various, transliterations, in, japanese, houei, nojiri, suggested, the, calque, mei, sei, star, of, the, king, god, of, the, underworld, and, this, was, borrowed, into, chinese, and, korean, some, languages, of, india, use, the, name, pluto, but, others, such, as, hindi, use, the, name, of, yama, the, god, of, death, in, hinduism, polynesian, languages, also, tend, to, use, the, indigenous, god, of, the, underworld, as, in, m, ori, whiro, vietnamese, might, be, expected, to, follow, chinese, but, does, not, because, the, sino, vietnamese, word, minh, dark, is, homophonous, with, minh, bright, vietnamese, instead, uses, yama, which, is, also, a, buddhist, deity, in, the, form, of, sao, di, m, v, ng, yama, s, star, derived, from, chinese, y, n, w, ng, y, hm, w, hng, king, yama, once, pluto, was, found, its, faintness, and, lack, of, a, viewable, disc, cast, doubt, on, the, idea, that, it, was, lowell, s, planet, x, estimates, of, pluto, s, mass, were, revised, downward, throughout, the, 20th, century, astronomers, initially, calculated, its, mass, based, on, its, presumed, effect, on, neptune, and, uranus, in, 1931, pluto, was, calculated, to, be, roughly, the, mass, of, earth, with, further, calculations, in, 1948, bringing, the, mass, down, to, roughly, that, of, mars, in, 1976, dale, cruikshank, carl, pilcher, and, david, morrison, of, the, university, of, hawai, i, calculated, pluto, s, albedo, for, the, first, time, finding, that, it, matched, that, for, methane, ice, this, meant, pluto, had, to, be, exceptionally, luminous, for, its, size, and, therefore, could, not, be, more, than, 1, percent, the, mass, of, earth, pluto, s, albedo, is, 1, 4, 1, 9, times, that, of, earth, in, 1978, the, discovery, of, pluto, s, moon, charon, allowed, the, measurement, of, pluto, s, mass, for, the, first, time, roughly, 0, 2, that, of, earth, and, far, too, small, to, account, for, the, discrepancies, in, the, orbit, of, uranus, subsequent, searches, for, an, alternative, planet, x, notably, by, robert, sutton, harrington, failed, in, 1992, myles, standish, used, data, from, voyager, 2, s, flyby, of, neptune, in, 1989, which, had, revised, the, estimates, of, neptune, s, mass, downward, by, 0, 5, an, amount, comparable, to, the, mass, of, mars, to, recalculate, its, gravitational, effect, on, uranus, with, the, new, figures, added, in, the, discrepancies, and, with, them, the, need, for, a, planet, x, vanished, as, of, 2000, the, majority, of, scientists, agree, that, planet, x, as, lowell, defined, it, does, not, exist, lowell, had, made, a, prediction, of, planet, x, s, orbit, and, position, in, 1915, that, was, fairly, close, to, pluto, s, actual, orbit, and, its, position, at, that, time, ernest, w, brown, concluded, soon, after, pluto, s, discovery, that, this, was, a, coincidence, from, 1992, onward, many, bodies, were, discovered, orbiting, in, the, same, volume, as, pluto, showing, that, pluto, is, part, of, a, population, of, objects, called, the, kuiper, belt, this, made, its, official, status, as, a, planet, controversial, with, many, questioning, whether, pluto, should, be, considered, together, with, or, separately, from, its, surrounding, population, museum, and, planetarium, directors, occasionally, created, controversy, by, omitting, pluto, from, planetary, models, of, the, solar, system, in, february, 2000, the, hayden, planetarium, in, new, york, city, displayed, a, solar, system, model, of, only, eight, planets, which, made, headlines, almost, a, year, later, ceres, pallas, juno, and, vesta, lost, their, planet, status, among, most, astronomers, after, the, discovery, of, many, other, asteroids, in, the, 1840s, on, the, other, hand, planetary, geologists, often, regarded, ceres, and, less, often, pallas, and, vesta, as, being, different, from, smaller, asteroids, because, they, were, large, enough, to, have, undergone, geological, evolution, although, the, first, kuiper, belt, objects, discovered, were, quite, small, objects, increasingly, closer, in, size, to, pluto, were, soon, discovered, some, large, enough, like, pluto, itself, to, satisfy, geological, but, not, dynamical, ideas, of, planethood, on, july, 29, 2005, the, debate, became, unavoidable, when, astronomers, at, caltech, announced, the, discovery, of, a, new, trans, neptunian, object, eris, which, was, substantially, more, massive, than, pluto, and, the, most, massive, object, discovered, in, the, solar, system, since, triton, in, 1846, its, discoverers, and, the, press, initially, called, it, the, tenth, planet, although, there, was, no, official, consensus, at, the, time, on, whether, to, call, it, a, planet, others, in, the, astronomical, community, considered, the, discovery, the, strongest, argument, for, reclassifying, pluto, as, a, minor, planet, the, debate, came, to, a, head, in, august, 2006, with, an, iau, resolution, that, created, an, official, definition, for, the, term, planet, according, to, this, resolution, there, are, three, conditions, for, an, object, in, the, solar, system, to, be, considered, a, planet, pluto, fails, to, meet, the, third, condition, its, mass, is, substantially, less, than, the, combined, mass, of, the, other, objects, in, its, orbit, 0, 07, times, in, contrast, to, earth, which, is, 1, 7, million, times, the, remaining, mass, in, its, orbit, excluding, the, moon, the, iau, further, decided, that, bodies, that, like, pluto, meet, criteria, 1, and, 2, but, do, not, meet, criterion, 3, would, be, called, dwarf, planets, in, september, 2006, the, iau, included, pluto, and, eris, and, its, moon, dysnomia, in, their, minor, planet, catalogue, giving, them, the, official, minor, planet, designations, 134340, pluto, 136199, eris, and, 136199, eris, i, dysnomia, had, pluto, been, included, upon, its, discovery, in, 1930, it, would, have, likely, been, designated, 1164, following, 1163, saga, which, was, discovered, a, month, earlier, there, has, been, some, resistance, within, the, astronomical, community, toward, the, reclassification, and, in, particular, planetary, scientists, often, continue, to, reject, it, considering, pluto, charon, and, eris, to, be, planets, for, the, same, reason, they, do, so, for, ceres, in, effect, this, amounts, to, accepting, only, the, second, clause, of, the, iau, definition, alan, stern, principal, investigator, with, nasa, s, new, horizons, mission, to, pluto, derided, the, iau, resolution, he, also, stated, that, because, less, than, five, percent, of, astronomers, voted, for, it, the, decision, was, not, representative, of, the, entire, astronomical, community, marc, w, buie, then, at, the, lowell, observatory, petitioned, against, the, definition, others, have, supported, the, iau, for, example, mike, brown, the, astronomer, who, discovered, eris, public, reception, to, the, iau, decision, was, mixed, a, resolution, introduced, in, the, california, state, assembly, facetiously, called, the, iau, decision, a, scientific, heresy, the, new, mexico, house, of, representatives, passed, a, resolution, in, honor, of, clyde, tombaugh, the, discoverer, of, pluto, and, a, longtime, resident, of, that, state, that, declared, that, pluto, will, always, be, considered, a, planet, while, in, new, mexican, skies, and, that, march, 13, 2007, was, pluto, planet, day, the, illinois, senate, passed, a, similar, resolution, in, 2009, on, the, basis, that, tombaugh, was, born, in, illinois, the, resolution, asserted, that, pluto, was, unfairly, downgraded, to, a, dwarf, planet, by, the, iau, some, members, of, the, public, have, also, rejected, the, change, citing, the, disagreement, within, the, scientific, community, on, the, issue, or, for, sentimental, reasons, maintaining, that, they, have, always, known, pluto, as, a, planet, and, will, continue, to, do, so, regardless, of, the, iau, decision, in, 2006, in, its, 17th, annual, words, of, the, year, vote, the, american, dialect, society, voted, plutoed, as, the, word, of, the, year, to, pluto, is, to, demote, or, devalue, someone, or, something, researchers, on, both, sides, of, the, debate, gathered, in, august, 2008, at, the, johns, hopkins, university, applied, physics, laboratory, for, a, conference, that, included, back, to, back, talks, on, the, iau, definition, of, a, planet, entitled, the, great, planet, debate, the, conference, published, a, post, conference, press, release, indicating, that, scientists, could, not, come, to, a, consensus, about, the, definition, of, planet, in, june, 2008, the, iau, had, announced, in, a, press, release, that, the, term, plutoid, would, henceforth, be, used, to, refer, to, pluto, and, other, planetary, mass, objects, that, have, an, orbital, semi, major, axis, greater, than, that, of, neptune, though, the, term, has, not, seen, significant, use, in, april, 2024, arizona, where, pluto, was, first, discovered, in, 1930, passed, a, law, naming, pluto, as, the, official, state, planet, pluto, s, orbital, period, is, about, 248, years, its, orbital, characteristics, are, substantially, different, from, those, of, the, planets, which, follow, nearly, circular, orbits, around, the, sun, close, to, a, flat, reference, plane, called, the, ecliptic, in, contrast, pluto, s, orbit, is, moderately, inclined, relative, to, the, ecliptic, over, 17, and, moderately, eccentric, elliptical, this, eccentricity, means, a, small, region, of, pluto, s, orbit, lies, closer, to, the, sun, than, neptune, s, the, pluto, charon, barycenter, came, to, perihelion, on, september, 5, 1989, and, was, last, closer, to, the, sun, than, neptune, between, february, 7, 1979, and, february, 11, 1999, although, the, 3, 2, resonance, with, neptune, see, below, is, maintained, pluto, s, inclination, and, eccentricity, behave, in, a, chaotic, manner, computer, simulations, can, be, used, to, predict, its, position, for, several, million, years, both, forward, and, backward, in, time, but, after, intervals, much, longer, than, the, lyapunov, time, of, 10, 20, million, years, calculations, become, unreliable, pluto, is, sensitive, to, immeasurably, small, details, of, the, solar, system, hard, to, predict, factors, that, will, gradually, change, pluto, s, position, in, its, orbit, the, semi, major, axis, of, pluto, s, orbit, varies, between, about, 39, 3, and, 39, 6, au, with, a, period, of, about, 19, 951, years, corresponding, to, an, orbital, period, varying, between, 246, and, 249, years, the, semi, major, axis, and, period, are, presently, getting, longer, despite, pluto, s, orbit, appearing, to, cross, that, of, neptune, when, viewed, from, north, or, south, of, the, solar, system, the, two, objects, orbits, do, not, intersect, when, pluto, is, closest, to, the, sun, and, close, to, neptune, s, orbit, as, viewed, from, such, a, position, it, is, also, the, farthest, north, of, neptune, s, path, pluto, s, orbit, passes, about, 8, au, north, of, that, of, neptune, preventing, a, collision, this, alone, is, not, enough, to, protect, pluto, perturbations, from, the, planets, especially, neptune, could, alter, pluto, s, orbit, such, as, its, orbital, precession, over, millions, of, years, so, that, a, collision, could, happen, however, pluto, is, also, protected, by, its, 2, 3, orbital, resonance, with, neptune, for, every, two, orbits, that, pluto, makes, around, the, sun, neptune, makes, three, in, a, frame, of, reference, that, rotates, at, the, rate, that, pluto, s, perihelion, precesses, about, 0, 97, 10, 4, degrees, per, year, each, cycle, lasts, about, 495, years, there, are, many, other, objects, in, this, same, resonance, called, plutinos, at, present, in, each, 495, year, cycle, the, first, time, pluto, is, at, perihelion, such, as, in, 1989, neptune, is, 57, ahead, of, pluto, by, pluto, s, second, passage, through, perihelion, neptune, will, have, completed, a, further, one, and, a, half, of, its, own, orbits, and, will, be, 123, behind, pluto, pluto, and, neptune, s, minimum, separation, is, over, 17, au, which, is, greater, than, pluto, s, minimum, separation, from, uranus, 11, au, the, minimum, separation, between, pluto, and, neptune, actually, occurs, near, the, time, of, pluto, s, aphelion, the, 2, 3, resonance, between, the, two, bodies, is, highly, stable, and, has, been, preserved, over, millions, of, years, this, prevents, their, orbits, from, changing, relative, to, one, another, so, the, two, bodies, can, never, pass, near, each, other, even, if, pluto, s, orbit, were, not, inclined, the, two, bodies, could, never, collide, when, pluto, s, period, is, slightly, different, from, 3, 2, of, neptune, s, the, pattern, of, its, distance, from, neptune, will, drift, near, perihelion, pluto, moves, interior, to, neptune, s, orbit, and, is, therefore, moving, faster, so, during, the, first, of, two, orbits, in, the, 495, year, cycle, it, is, approaching, neptune, from, behind, at, present, it, remains, between, 50, and, 65, behind, neptune, for, 100, years, e, g, 1937, 2036, the, gravitational, pull, between, the, two, causes, angular, momentum, to, be, transferred, to, pluto, this, situation, moves, pluto, into, a, slightly, larger, orbit, where, it, has, a, slightly, longer, period, according, to, kepler, s, third, law, after, several, such, repetitions, pluto, is, sufficiently, delayed, that, at, the, second, perihelion, of, each, cycle, it, will, not, be, far, ahead, of, neptune, coming, behind, it, and, neptune, will, start, to, decrease, pluto, s, period, again, the, whole, cycle, takes, about, 20, 000, years, to, complete, numerical, studies, have, shown, that, over, millions, of, years, the, general, nature, of, the, alignment, between, the, orbits, of, pluto, and, neptune, does, not, change, there, are, several, other, resonances, and, interactions, that, enhance, pluto, s, stability, these, arise, principally, from, two, additional, mechanisms, besides, the, 2, 3, mean, motion, resonance, first, pluto, s, argument, of, perihelion, the, angle, between, the, point, where, it, crosses, the, ecliptic, or, the, invariant, plane, and, the, point, where, it, is, closest, to, the, sun, librates, around, 90, this, means, that, when, pluto, is, closest, to, the, sun, it, is, at, its, farthest, north, of, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, preventing, encounters, with, neptune, this, is, a, consequence, of, the, kozai, mechanism, which, relates, the, eccentricity, of, an, orbit, to, its, inclination, to, a, larger, perturbing, body, in, this, case, neptune, relative, to, neptune, the, amplitude, of, libration, is, 38, and, so, the, angular, separation, of, pluto, s, perihelion, to, the, orbit, of, neptune, is, always, greater, than, 52, 90, 38, the, closest, such, angular, separation, occurs, every, 10, 000, years, second, the, longitudes, of, ascending, nodes, of, the, two, bodies, the, points, where, they, cross, the, invariant, plane, are, in, near, resonance, with, the, above, libration, when, the, two, longitudes, are, the, same, that, is, when, one, could, draw, a, straight, line, through, both, nodes, and, the, sun, pluto, s, perihelion, lies, exactly, at, 90, and, hence, it, comes, closest, to, the, sun, when, it, is, furthest, north, of, neptune, s, orbit, this, is, known, as, the, 1, 1, superresonance, all, the, jovian, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, play, a, role, in, the, creation, of, the, superresonance, the, 2nd, largest, known, plutino, orcus, has, a, diameter, around, 900, km, and, is, in, a, very, similar, orbit, to, that, of, pluto, however, the, orbits, of, pluto, and, orcus, are, out, of, phase, so, that, the, two, never, approach, each, other, it, has, been, termed, the, anti, pluto, and, is, named, for, the, etruscan, counterpart, to, the, god, pluto, pluto, s, rotation, period, its, day, is, equal, to, 6, 387, earth, days, like, uranus, and, 2, pallas, pluto, rotates, on, its, side, in, its, orbital, plane, with, an, axial, tilt, of, 120, and, so, its, seasonal, variation, is, extreme, at, its, solstices, one, fourth, of, its, surface, is, in, continuous, daylight, whereas, another, fourth, is, in, continuous, darkness, the, reason, for, this, unusual, orientation, has, been, debated, research, from, the, university, of, arizona, has, suggested, that, it, may, be, due, to, the, way, that, a, body, s, spin, will, always, adjust, to, minimize, energy, this, could, mean, a, body, reorienting, itself, to, put, extraneous, mass, near, the, equator, and, regions, lacking, mass, tend, towards, the, poles, this, is, called, polar, wander, according, to, a, paper, released, from, the, university, of, arizona, this, could, be, caused, by, masses, of, frozen, nitrogen, building, up, in, shadowed, areas, of, the, dwarf, planet, these, masses, would, cause, the, body, to, reorient, itself, leading, to, its, unusual, axial, tilt, of, 120, the, buildup, of, nitrogen, is, due, to, pluto, s, vast, distance, from, the, sun, at, the, equator, temperatures, can, drop, to, 240, c, 400, 0, f, 33, 1, k, causing, nitrogen, to, freeze, as, water, would, freeze, on, earth, the, same, polar, wandering, effect, seen, on, pluto, would, be, observed, on, earth, were, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, several, times, larger, the, plains, on, pluto, s, surface, are, composed, of, more, than, 98, percent, nitrogen, ice, with, traces, of, methane, and, carbon, monoxide, nitrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, are, most, abundant, on, the, anti, charon, face, of, pluto, around, 180, longitude, where, tombaugh, regio, s, western, lobe, sputnik, planitia, is, located, whereas, methane, is, most, abundant, near, 300, east, the, mountains, are, made, of, water, ice, pluto, s, surface, is, quite, varied, with, large, differences, in, both, brightness, and, color, pluto, is, one, of, the, most, contrastive, bodies, in, the, solar, system, with, as, much, contrast, as, saturn, s, moon, iapetus, the, color, varies, from, charcoal, black, to, dark, orange, and, white, pluto, s, color, is, more, similar, to, that, of, io, with, slightly, more, orange, and, significantly, less, red, than, mars, notable, geographical, features, include, tombaugh, regio, or, the, heart, a, large, bright, area, on, the, side, opposite, charon, belton, regio, or, the, whale, a, large, dark, area, on, the, trailing, hemisphere, and, the, brass, knuckles, a, series, of, equatorial, dark, areas, on, the, leading, hemisphere, sputnik, planitia, the, western, lobe, of, the, heart, is, a, 1, 000, km, wide, basin, of, frozen, nitrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, ices, divided, into, polygonal, cells, which, are, interpreted, as, convection, cells, that, carry, floating, blocks, of, water, ice, crust, and, sublimation, pits, towards, their, margins, there, are, obvious, signs, of, glacial, flows, both, into, and, out, of, the, basin, it, has, no, craters, that, were, visible, to, new, horizons, indicating, that, its, surface, is, less, than, 10, million, years, old, latest, studies, have, shown, that, the, surface, has, an, age, of, 180, 000, 90, 000, 40, 000, years, the, new, horizons, science, team, summarized, initial, findings, as, pluto, displays, a, surprisingly, wide, variety, of, geological, landforms, including, those, resulting, from, glaciological, and, surface, atmosphere, interactions, as, well, as, impact, tectonic, possible, cryovolcanic, and, mass, wasting, processes, in, western, parts, of, sputnik, planitia, there, are, fields, of, transverse, dunes, formed, by, the, winds, blowing, from, the, center, of, sputnik, planitia, in, the, direction, of, surrounding, mountains, the, dune, wavelengths, are, in, the, range, of, 0, 4, 1, km, and, likely, consist, of, methane, particles, 200, 300, m, in, size, pluto, s, density, is, 1, 853, 0, 004, g, cm, 3, because, the, decay, of, radioactive, elements, would, eventually, heat, the, ices, enough, for, the, rock, to, separate, from, them, scientists, expect, that, pluto, s, internal, structure, is, differentiated, with, the, rocky, material, having, settled, into, a, dense, core, surrounded, by, a, mantle, of, water, ice, the, pre, new, horizons, estimate, for, the, diameter, of, the, core, is, 1700, km, 70, of, pluto, s, diameter, it, is, possible, that, such, heating, continues, creating, a, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, water, 100, to, 180, km, thick, at, the, core, mantle, boundary, in, september, 2016, scientists, at, brown, university, simulated, the, impact, thought, to, have, formed, sputnik, planitia, and, showed, that, it, might, have, been, the, result, of, liquid, water, upweling, from, below, after, the, collision, implying, the, existence, of, a, subsurface, ocean, at, least, 100, km, deep, in, june, 2020, astronomers, reported, evidence, that, pluto, may, have, had, a, subsurface, ocean, and, consequently, may, have, been, habitable, when, it, was, first, formed, in, march, 2022, a, team, of, researchers, proposed, that, the, mountains, wright, mons, and, piccard, mons, are, actually, a, merger, of, many, smaller, cryovolcanic, domes, suggesting, a, source, of, heat, on, the, body, at, levels, previously, thought, not, possible, pluto, s, diameter, is, 2, 376, 6, 3, 2, km, and, its, mass, is, 1, 303, 0, 003, 10, 22, kg, 17, 7, that, of, the, moon, 0, 22, that, of, earth, its, surface, area, is, 1, 774, 443, 10, 7, km, 2, or, just, slightly, bigger, than, russia, or, antarctica, particularly, including, the, antarctic, sea, ice, during, winter, its, surface, gravity, is, 0, 063, g, compared, to, 1, g, for, earth, and, 0, 17, g, for, the, moon, this, gives, pluto, an, escape, velocity, of, 4, 363, 2, km, per, hour, 2, 711, 167, miles, per, hour, as, compared, to, earth, s, 40, 270, km, per, hour, 25, 020, miles, per, hour, pluto, is, more, than, twice, the, diameter, and, a, dozen, times, the, mass, of, ceres, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, it, is, less, massive, than, the, dwarf, planet, eris, a, trans, neptunian, object, discovered, in, 2005, though, pluto, has, a, larger, diameter, of, 2, 376, 6, km, compared, to, eris, s, approximate, diameter, of, 2, 326, km, with, less, than, 0, 2, lunar, masses, pluto, is, much, less, massive, than, the, terrestrial, planets, and, also, less, massive, than, seven, moons, ganymede, titan, callisto, io, the, moon, europa, and, triton, the, mass, is, much, less, than, thought, before, charon, was, discovered, the, discovery, of, pluto, s, satellite, charon, in, 1978, enabled, a, determination, of, the, mass, of, the, pluto, charon, system, by, application, of, newton, s, formulation, of, kepler, s, third, law, observations, of, pluto, in, occultation, with, charon, allowed, scientists, to, establish, pluto, s, diameter, more, accurately, whereas, the, invention, of, adaptive, optics, allowed, them, to, determine, its, shape, more, accurately, determinations, of, pluto, s, size, have, been, complicated, by, its, atmosphere, and, hydrocarbon, haze, in, march, 2014, lellouch, de, bergh, et, al, published, findings, regarding, methane, mixing, ratios, in, pluto, s, atmosphere, consistent, with, a, plutonian, diameter, greater, than, 2, 360, km, with, a, best, guess, of, 2, 368, km, on, july, 13, 2015, images, from, nasa, s, new, horizons, mission, long, range, reconnaissance, imager, lorri, along, with, data, from, the, other, instruments, determined, pluto, s, diameter, to, be, 2, 370, km, 1, 473, mi, which, was, later, revised, to, be, 2, 372, km, 1, 474, mi, on, july, 24, and, later, to, 2374, 8, km, using, radio, occultation, data, from, the, new, horizons, radio, science, experiment, rex, the, diameter, was, found, to, be, 2, 376, 6, 3, 2, km, pluto, has, a, tenuous, atmosphere, consisting, of, nitrogen, n, 2, methane, ch, 4, and, carbon, monoxide, co, which, are, in, equilibrium, with, their, ices, on, pluto, s, surface, according, to, the, measurements, by, new, horizons, the, surface, pressure, is, about, 1, pa, 10, bar, roughly, one, million, to, 100, 000, times, less, than, earth, s, atmospheric, pressure, it, was, initially, thought, that, as, pluto, moves, away, from, the, sun, its, atmosphere, should, gradually, freeze, onto, the, surface, studies, of, new, horizons, data, and, ground, based, occultations, show, that, pluto, s, atmospheric, density, increases, and, that, it, likely, remains, gaseous, throughout, pluto, s, orbit, new, horizons, observations, showed, that, atmospheric, escape, of, nitrogen, to, be, 10, 000, times, less, than, expected, alan, stern, has, contended, that, even, a, small, increase, in, pluto, s, surface, temperature, can, lead, to, exponential, increases, in, pluto, s, atmospheric, density, from, 18, hpa, to, as, much, as, 280, hpa, three, times, that, of, mars, to, a, quarter, that, of, the, earth, at, such, densities, nitrogen, could, flow, across, the, surface, as, liquid, just, like, sweat, cools, the, body, as, it, evaporates, from, the, skin, the, sublimation, of, pluto, s, atmosphere, cools, its, surface, pluto, has, no, or, almost, no, troposphere, observations, by, new, horizons, suggest, only, a, thin, tropospheric, boundary, layer, its, thickness, in, the, place, of, measurement, was, 4, km, and, the, temperature, was, 37, 3, k, the, layer, is, not, continuous, in, july, 2019, an, occultation, by, pluto, showed, that, its, atmospheric, pressure, against, expectations, had, fallen, by, 20, since, 2016, in, 2021, astronomers, at, the, southwest, research, institute, confirmed, the, result, using, data, from, an, occultation, in, 2018, which, showed, that, light, was, appearing, less, gradually, from, behind, pluto, s, disc, indicating, a, thinning, atmosphere, the, presence, of, methane, a, powerful, greenhouse, gas, in, pluto, s, atmosphere, creates, a, temperature, inversion, with, the, average, temperature, of, its, atmosphere, tens, of, degrees, warmer, than, its, surface, though, observations, by, new, horizons, have, revealed, pluto, s, upper, atmosphere, to, be, far, colder, than, expected, 70, k, as, opposed, to, about, 100, k, pluto, s, atmosphere, is, divided, into, roughly, 20, regularly, spaced, haze, layers, up, to, 150, km, high, thought, to, be, the, result, of, pressure, waves, created, by, airflow, across, pluto, s, mountains, pluto, has, five, known, natural, satellites, the, largest, and, closest, to, pluto, is, charon, first, identified, in, 1978, by, astronomer, james, christy, charon, is, the, only, moon, of, pluto, that, may, be, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, charon, s, mass, is, sufficient, to, cause, the, barycenter, of, the, pluto, charon, system, to, be, outside, pluto, beyond, charon, there, are, four, much, smaller, circumbinary, moons, in, order, of, distance, from, pluto, they, are, styx, nix, kerberos, and, hydra, nix, and, hydra, were, both, discovered, in, 2005, kerberos, was, discovered, in, 2011, and, styx, was, discovered, in, 2012, the, satellites, orbits, are, circular, eccentricity, 0, 006, and, coplanar, with, pluto, s, equator, inclination, 1, and, therefore, tilted, approximately, 120, relative, to, pluto, s, orbit, the, plutonian, system, is, highly, compact, the, five, known, satellites, orbit, within, the, inner, 3, of, the, region, where, prograde, orbits, would, be, stable, the, orbital, periods, of, all, pluto, s, moons, are, linked, in, a, system, of, orbital, resonances, and, near, resonances, when, precession, is, accounted, for, the, orbital, periods, of, styx, nix, and, hydra, are, in, an, exact, 18, 22, 33, ratio, there, is, a, sequence, of, approximate, ratios, 3, 4, 5, 6, between, the, periods, of, styx, nix, kerberos, and, hydra, with, that, of, charon, the, ratios, become, closer, to, being, exact, the, further, out, the, moons, are, the, pluto, charon, system, is, one, of, the, few, in, the, solar, system, whose, barycenter, lies, outside, the, primary, body, the, patroclus, menoetius, system, is, a, smaller, example, and, the, sun, jupiter, system, is, the, only, larger, one, the, similarity, in, size, of, charon, and, pluto, has, prompted, some, astronomers, to, call, it, a, double, dwarf, planet, the, system, is, also, unusual, among, planetary, systems, in, that, each, is, tidally, locked, to, the, other, which, means, that, pluto, and, charon, always, have, the, same, hemisphere, facing, each, other, a, property, shared, by, only, one, other, known, system, eris, and, dysnomia, from, any, position, on, either, body, the, other, is, always, at, the, same, position, in, the, sky, or, always, obscured, this, also, means, that, the, rotation, period, of, each, is, equal, to, the, time, it, takes, the, entire, system, to, rotate, around, its, barycenter, pluto, s, moons, are, hypothesized, to, have, been, formed, by, a, collision, between, pluto, and, a, similar, sized, body, early, in, the, history, of, the, solar, system, the, collision, released, material, that, consolidated, into, the, moons, around, pluto, in, 2012, it, was, calculated, that, 15810, arawn, could, be, a, quasi, satellite, of, pluto, a, specific, type, of, co, orbital, configuration, according, to, the, calculations, the, object, would, be, a, quasi, satellite, of, pluto, for, about, 350, 000, years, out, of, every, two, million, year, period, measurements, made, by, the, new, horizons, spacecraft, in, 2015, made, it, possible, to, calculate, the, orbit, of, arawn, more, accurately, and, confirmed, the, earlier, ones, however, it, is, not, agreed, upon, among, astronomers, whether, arawn, should, be, classified, as, a, quasi, satellite, of, pluto, based, on, its, orbital, dynamics, since, its, orbit, is, primarily, controlled, by, neptune, with, only, occasional, perturbations, by, pluto, pluto, s, origin, and, identity, had, long, puzzled, astronomers, one, early, hypothesis, was, that, pluto, was, an, escaped, moon, of, neptune, knocked, out, of, orbit, by, neptune, s, largest, moon, triton, this, idea, was, eventually, rejected, after, dynamical, studies, showed, it, to, be, impossible, because, pluto, never, approaches, neptune, in, its, orbit, pluto, s, true, place, in, the, solar, system, began, to, reveal, itself, only, in, 1992, when, astronomers, began, to, find, small, icy, objects, beyond, neptune, that, were, similar, to, pluto, not, only, in, orbit, but, also, in, size, and, composition, this, trans, neptunian, population, is, thought, to, be, the, source, of, many, short, period, comets, pluto, is, the, largest, member, of, the, kuiper, belt, a, stable, belt, of, objects, located, between, 30, and, 50, au, from, the, sun, as, of, 2011, surveys, of, the, kuiper, belt, to, magnitude, 21, were, nearly, complete, and, any, remaining, pluto, sized, objects, are, expected, to, be, beyond, 100, au, from, the, sun, like, other, kuiper, belt, objects, kbos, pluto, shares, features, with, comets, for, example, the, solar, wind, is, gradually, blowing, pluto, s, surface, into, space, it, has, been, claimed, that, if, pluto, were, placed, as, near, to, the, sun, as, earth, it, would, develop, a, tail, as, comets, do, this, claim, has, been, disputed, with, the, argument, that, pluto, s, escape, velocity, is, too, high, for, this, to, happen, it, has, been, proposed, that, pluto, may, have, formed, as, a, result, of, the, agglomeration, of, numerous, comets, and, kuiper, belt, objects, though, pluto, is, the, largest, kuiper, belt, object, discovered, neptune, s, moon, triton, which, is, larger, than, pluto, is, similar, to, it, both, geologically, and, atmospherically, and, is, thought, to, be, a, captured, kuiper, belt, object, eris, see, above, is, about, the, same, size, as, pluto, though, more, massive, but, is, not, strictly, considered, a, member, of, the, kuiper, belt, population, rather, it, is, considered, a, member, of, a, linked, population, called, the, scattered, disc, like, other, members, of, the, kuiper, belt, pluto, is, thought, to, be, a, residual, planetesimal, a, component, of, the, original, protoplanetary, disc, around, the, sun, that, failed, to, fully, coalesce, into, a, full, fledged, planet, most, astronomers, agree, that, pluto, owes, its, position, to, a, sudden, migration, undergone, by, neptune, early, in, the, solar, system, s, formation, as, neptune, migrated, outward, it, approached, the, objects, in, the, proto, kuiper, belt, setting, one, in, orbit, around, itself, triton, locking, others, into, resonances, and, knocking, others, into, chaotic, orbits, the, objects, in, the, scattered, disc, a, dynamically, unstable, region, overlapping, the, kuiper, belt, are, thought, to, have, been, placed, in, their, positions, by, interactions, with, neptune, s, migrating, resonances, a, computer, model, created, in, 2004, by, alessandro, morbidelli, of, the, observatoire, de, la, c, te, d, azur, in, nice, suggested, that, the, migration, of, neptune, into, the, kuiper, belt, may, have, been, triggered, by, the, formation, of, a, 1, 2, resonance, between, jupiter, and, saturn, which, created, a, gravitational, push, that, propelled, both, uranus, and, neptune, into, higher, orbits, and, caused, them, to, switch, places, ultimately, doubling, neptune, s, distance, from, the, sun, the, resultant, expulsion, of, objects, from, the, proto, kuiper, belt, could, also, explain, the, late, heavy, bombardment, 600, million, years, after, the, solar, system, s, formation, and, the, origin, of, the, jupiter, trojans, it, is, possible, that, pluto, had, a, near, circular, orbit, about, 33, au, from, the, sun, before, neptune, s, migration, perturbed, it, into, a, resonant, capture, the, nice, model, requires, that, there, were, about, a, thousand, pluto, sized, bodies, in, the, original, planetesimal, disk, which, included, triton, and, eris, pluto, s, distance, from, earth, makes, its, in, depth, study, and, exploration, difficult, pluto, s, visual, apparent, magnitude, averages, 15, 1, brightening, to, 13, 65, at, perihelion, to, see, it, a, telescope, is, required, around, 30, cm, 12, in, aperture, being, desirable, it, looks, star, like, and, without, a, visible, disk, even, in, large, telescopes, because, its, angular, diameter, is, maximum, 0, 11, the, earliest, maps, of, pluto, made, in, the, late, 1980s, were, brightness, maps, created, from, close, observations, of, eclipses, by, its, largest, moon, charon, observations, were, made, of, the, change, in, the, total, average, brightness, of, the, pluto, charon, system, during, the, eclipses, for, example, eclipsing, a, bright, spot, on, pluto, makes, a, bigger, total, brightness, change, than, eclipsing, a, dark, spot, computer, processing, of, many, such, observations, can, be, used, to, create, a, brightness, map, this, method, can, also, track, changes, in, brightness, over, time, better, maps, were, produced, from, images, taken, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, hst, which, offered, higher, resolution, and, showed, considerably, more, detail, resolving, variations, several, hundred, kilometers, across, including, polar, regions, and, large, bright, spots, these, maps, were, produced, by, complex, computer, processing, which, finds, the, best, fit, projected, maps, for, the, few, pixels, of, the, hubble, images, these, remained, the, most, detailed, maps, of, pluto, until, the, flyby, of, new, horizons, in, july, 2015, because, the, two, cameras, on, the, hst, used, for, these, maps, were, no, longer, in, service, the, new, horizons, spacecraft, which, flew, by, pluto, in, july, 2015, is, the, first, and, so, far, only, attempt, to, explore, pluto, directly, launched, in, 2006, it, captured, its, first, distant, images, of, pluto, in, late, september, 2006, during, a, test, of, the, long, range, reconnaissance, imager, the, images, taken, from, a, distance, of, approximately, 4, 2, billion, kilometers, confirmed, the, spacecraft, s, ability, to, track, distant, targets, critical, for, maneuvering, toward, pluto, and, other, kuiper, belt, objects, in, early, 2007, the, craft, made, use, of, a, gravity, assist, from, jupiter, new, horizons, made, its, closest, approach, to, pluto, on, july, 14, 2015, after, a, 3, 462, day, journey, across, the, solar, system, scientific, observations, of, pluto, began, five, months, before, the, closest, approach, and, continued, for, at, least, a, month, after, the, encounter, observations, were, conducted, using, a, remote, sensing, package, that, included, imaging, instruments, and, a, radio, science, investigation, tool, as, well, as, spectroscopic, and, other, experiments, the, scientific, goals, of, new, horizons, were, to, characterize, the, global, geology, and, morphology, of, pluto, and, its, moon, charon, map, their, surface, composition, and, analyze, pluto, s, neutral, atmosphere, and, its, escape, rate, on, october, 25, 2016, at, 05, 48, pm, et, the, last, bit, of, data, of, a, total, of, 50, billion, bits, of, data, or, 6, 25, gigabytes, was, received, from, new, horizons, from, its, close, encounter, with, pluto, since, the, new, horizons, flyby, scientists, have, advocated, for, an, orbiter, mission, that, would, return, to, pluto, to, fulfill, new, science, objectives, they, include, mapping, the, surface, at, 9, 1, m, 30, ft, per, pixel, observations, of, pluto, s, smaller, satellites, observations, of, how, pluto, changes, as, it, rotates, on, its, axis, investigations, of, a, possible, subsurface, ocean, and, topographic, mapping, of, pluto, s, regions, that, are, covered, in, long, term, darkness, due, to, its, axial, tilt, the, last, objective, could, be, accomplished, using, laser, pulses, to, generate, a, complete, topographic, map, of, pluto, new, horizons, principal, investigator, alan, stern, has, advocated, for, a, cassini, style, orbiter, that, would, launch, around, 2030, the, 100th, anniversary, of, pluto, s, discovery, and, use, charon, s, gravity, to, adjust, its, orbit, as, needed, to, fulfill, science, objectives, after, arriving, at, the, pluto, system, the, orbiter, could, then, use, charon, s, gravity, to, leave, the, pluto, system, and, study, more, kbos, after, all, pluto, science, objectives, are, completed, a, conceptual, study, funded, by, the, nasa, innovative, advanced, concepts, niac, program, describes, a, fusion, enabled, pluto, orbiter, and, lander, based, on, the, princeton, field, reversed, configuration, reactor, new, horizons, imaged, all, of, pluto, s, northern, hemisphere, and, the, equatorial, regions, down, to, about, 30, south, higher, southern, latitudes, have, only, been, observed, at, very, low, resolution, from, earth, images, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, in,
