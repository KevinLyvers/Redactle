an, irregular, galaxy, is, a, galaxy, that, does, not, have, a, distinct, regular, shape, unlike, a, spiral, or, an, elliptical, galaxy, irregular, galaxies, do, not, fall, into, any, of, the, regular, classes, of, the, hubble, sequence, and, they, are, often, chaotic, in, appearance, with, neither, a, nuclear, bulge, nor, any, trace, of, spiral, arm, structure, collectively, they, are, thought, to, make, up, about, a, quarter, of, all, galaxies, some, irregular, galaxies, were, once, spiral, or, elliptical, galaxies, but, were, deformed, by, an, uneven, external, gravitational, force, irregular, galaxies, may, contain, abundant, amounts, of, gas, and, dust, this, is, not, necessarily, true, for, dwarf, irregulars, irregular, galaxies, are, commonly, small, about, one, tenth, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, though, there, are, also, unusual, cases, of, large, irregulars, like, ugc, 6697, due, to, their, small, sizes, they, are, prone, to, environmental, effects, like, colliding, with, large, galaxies, and, intergalactic, clouds, there, are, three, major, types, of, irregular, galaxies, some, of, the, irregular, galaxies, especially, of, the, magellanic, type, are, small, spiral, galaxies, that, are, being, distorted, by, the, gravity, of, a, larger, neighbor, the, magellanic, cloud, galaxies, were, once, classified, as, irregular, galaxies, the, large, magellanic, cloud, has, since, been, re, classified, as, type, sbm, barred, magellanic, spiral, the, small, magellanic, cloud, remains, classified, as, an, irregular, galaxy, of, type, im, under, current, galaxy, morphological, classification, although, it, does, contain, a, bar, structure
