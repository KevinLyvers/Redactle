a, chemical, reaction, is, a, process, that, leads, to, the, chemical, transformation, of, one, set, of, chemical, substances, to, another, when, chemical, reactions, occur, the, atoms, are, rearranged, and, the, reaction, is, accompanied, by, an, energy, change, as, new, products, are, generated, classically, chemical, reactions, encompass, changes, that, only, involve, the, positions, of, electrons, in, the, forming, and, breaking, of, chemical, bonds, between, atoms, with, no, change, to, the, nuclei, no, change, to, the, elements, present, and, can, often, be, described, by, a, chemical, equation, nuclear, chemistry, is, a, sub, discipline, of, chemistry, that, involves, the, chemical, reactions, of, unstable, and, radioactive, elements, where, both, electronic, and, nuclear, changes, can, occur, the, substance, or, substances, initially, involved, in, a, chemical, reaction, are, called, reactants, or, reagents, chemical, reactions, are, usually, characterized, by, a, chemical, change, and, they, yield, one, or, more, products, which, usually, have, properties, different, from, the, reactants, reactions, often, consist, of, a, sequence, of, individual, sub, steps, the, so, called, elementary, reactions, and, the, information, on, the, precise, course, of, action, is, part, of, the, reaction, mechanism, chemical, reactions, are, described, with, chemical, equations, which, symbolically, present, the, starting, materials, end, products, and, sometimes, intermediate, products, and, reaction, conditions, chemical, reactions, happen, at, a, characteristic, reaction, rate, at, a, given, temperature, and, chemical, concentration, some, reactions, produce, heat, and, are, called, exothermic, reactions, while, others, may, require, heat, to, enable, the, reaction, to, occur, which, are, called, endothermic, reactions, typically, reaction, rates, increase, with, increasing, temperature, because, there, is, more, thermal, energy, available, to, reach, the, activation, energy, necessary, for, breaking, bonds, between, atoms, a, reaction, may, be, classified, as, redox, in, which, oxidation, and, reduction, occur, or, non, redox, in, which, there, is, no, oxidation, and, reduction, occurring, most, simple, redox, reactions, may, be, classified, as, a, combination, decomposition, or, single, displacement, reaction, different, chemical, reactions, are, used, during, chemical, synthesis, in, order, to, obtain, the, desired, product, in, biochemistry, a, consecutive, series, of, chemical, reactions, where, the, product, of, one, reaction, is, the, reactant, of, the, next, reaction, form, metabolic, pathways, these, reactions, are, often, catalyzed, by, protein, enzymes, enzymes, increase, the, rates, of, biochemical, reactions, so, that, metabolic, syntheses, and, decompositions, impossible, under, ordinary, conditions, can, occur, at, the, temperature, and, concentrations, present, within, a, cell, the, general, concept, of, a, chemical, reaction, has, been, extended, to, reactions, between, entities, smaller, than, atoms, including, nuclear, reactions, radioactive, decays, and, reactions, between, elementary, particles, as, described, by, quantum, field, theory, chemical, reactions, such, as, combustion, in, fire, fermentation, and, the, reduction, of, ores, to, metals, were, known, since, antiquity, initial, theories, of, transformation, of, materials, were, developed, by, greek, philosophers, such, as, the, four, element, theory, of, empedocles, stating, that, any, substance, is, composed, of, the, four, basic, elements, fire, water, air, and, earth, in, the, middle, ages, chemical, transformations, were, studied, by, alchemists, they, attempted, in, particular, to, convert, lead, into, gold, for, which, purpose, they, used, reactions, of, lead, and, lead, copper, alloys, with, sulfur, the, artificial, production, of, chemical, substances, already, was, a, central, goal, for, medieval, alchemists, examples, include, the, synthesis, of, ammonium, chloride, from, organic, substances, as, described, in, the, works, c, 850, 950, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, or, the, production, of, mineral, acids, such, as, sulfuric, and, nitric, acids, by, later, alchemists, starting, from, c, 1300, the, production, of, mineral, acids, involved, the, heating, of, sulfate, and, nitrate, minerals, such, as, copper, sulfate, alum, and, saltpeter, in, the, 17th, century, johann, rudolph, glauber, produced, hydrochloric, acid, and, sodium, sulfate, by, reacting, sulfuric, acid, and, sodium, chloride, with, the, development, of, the, lead, chamber, process, in, 1746, and, the, leblanc, process, allowing, large, scale, production, of, sulfuric, acid, and, sodium, carbonate, respectively, chemical, reactions, became, implemented, into, the, industry, further, optimization, of, sulfuric, acid, technology, resulted, in, the, contact, process, in, the, 1880s, and, the, haber, process, was, developed, in, 1909, 1910, for, ammonia, synthesis, from, the, 16th, century, researchers, including, jan, baptist, van, helmont, robert, boyle, and, isaac, newton, tried, to, establish, theories, of, experimentally, observed, chemical, transformations, the, phlogiston, theory, was, proposed, in, 1667, by, johann, joachim, becher, it, postulated, the, existence, of, a, fire, like, element, called, phlogiston, which, was, contained, within, combustible, bodies, and, released, during, combustion, this, proved, to, be, false, in, 1785, by, antoine, lavoisier, who, found, the, correct, explanation, of, the, combustion, as, a, reaction, with, oxygen, from, the, air, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, recognized, in, 1808, that, gases, always, react, in, a, certain, relationship, with, each, other, based, on, this, idea, and, the, atomic, theory, of, john, dalton, joseph, proust, had, developed, the, law, of, definite, proportions, which, later, resulted, in, the, concepts, of, stoichiometry, and, chemical, equations, regarding, the, organic, chemistry, it, was, long, believed, that, compounds, obtained, from, living, organisms, were, too, complex, to, be, obtained, synthetically, according, to, the, concept, of, vitalism, organic, matter, was, endowed, with, a, vital, force, and, distinguished, from, inorganic, materials, this, separation, was, ended, however, by, the, synthesis, of, urea, from, inorganic, precursors, by, friedrich, w, hler, in, 1828, other, chemists, who, brought, major, contributions, to, organic, chemistry, include, alexander, william, williamson, with, his, synthesis, of, ethers, and, christopher, kelk, ingold, who, among, many, discoveries, established, the, mechanisms, of, substitution, reactions, the, general, characteristics, of, chemical, reactions, are, chemical, equations, are, used, to, graphically, illustrate, chemical, reactions, they, consist, of, chemical, or, structural, formulas, of, the, reactants, on, the, left, and, those, of, the, products, on, the, right, they, are, separated, by, an, arrow, which, indicates, the, direction, and, type, of, the, reaction, the, arrow, is, read, as, the, word, yields, the, tip, of, the, arrow, points, in, the, direction, in, which, the, reaction, proceeds, a, double, arrow, pointing, in, opposite, directions, is, used, for, equilibrium, reactions, equations, should, be, balanced, according, to, the, stoichiometry, the, number, of, atoms, of, each, species, should, be, the, same, on, both, sides, of, the, equation, this, is, achieved, by, scaling, the, number, of, involved, molecules, a, b, c, and, d, in, a, schematic, example, below, by, the, appropriate, integers, a, b, c, and, d, more, elaborate, reactions, are, represented, by, reaction, schemes, which, in, addition, to, starting, materials, and, products, show, important, intermediates, or, transition, states, also, some, relatively, minor, additions, to, the, reaction, can, be, indicated, above, the, reaction, arrow, examples, of, such, additions, are, water, heat, illumination, a, catalyst, etc, similarly, some, minor, products, can, be, placed, below, the, arrow, often, with, a, minus, sign, retrosynthetic, analysis, can, be, applied, to, design, a, complex, synthesis, reaction, here, the, analysis, starts, from, the, products, for, example, by, splitting, selected, chemical, bonds, to, arrive, at, plausible, initial, reagents, a, special, arrow, is, used, in, retro, reactions, the, elementary, reaction, is, the, smallest, division, into, which, a, chemical, reaction, can, be, decomposed, it, has, no, intermediate, products, most, experimentally, observed, reactions, are, built, up, from, many, elementary, reactions, that, occur, in, parallel, or, sequentially, the, actual, sequence, of, the, individual, elementary, reactions, is, known, as, reaction, mechanism, an, elementary, reaction, involves, a, few, molecules, usually, one, or, two, because, of, the, low, probability, for, several, molecules, to, meet, at, a, certain, time, the, most, important, elementary, reactions, are, unimolecular, and, bimolecular, reactions, only, one, molecule, is, involved, in, a, unimolecular, reaction, it, is, transformed, by, isomerization, or, a, dissociation, into, one, or, more, other, molecules, such, reactions, require, the, addition, of, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, or, light, a, typical, example, of, a, unimolecular, reaction, is, the, cis, trans, isomerization, in, which, the, cis, form, of, a, compound, converts, to, the, trans, form, or, vice, versa, in, a, typical, dissociation, reaction, a, bond, in, a, molecule, splits, ruptures, resulting, in, two, molecular, fragments, the, splitting, can, be, homolytic, or, heterolytic, in, the, first, case, the, bond, is, divided, so, that, each, product, retains, an, electron, and, becomes, a, neutral, radical, in, the, second, case, both, electrons, of, the, chemical, bond, remain, with, one, of, the, products, resulting, in, charged, ions, dissociation, plays, an, important, role, in, triggering, chain, reactions, such, as, hydrogen, oxygen, or, polymerization, reactions, for, bimolecular, reactions, two, molecules, collide, and, react, with, each, other, their, merger, is, called, chemical, synthesis, or, an, addition, reaction, another, possibility, is, that, only, a, portion, of, one, molecule, is, transferred, to, the, other, molecule, this, type, of, reaction, occurs, for, example, in, redox, and, acid, base, reactions, in, redox, reactions, the, transferred, particle, is, an, electron, whereas, in, acid, base, reactions, it, is, a, proton, this, type, of, reaction, is, also, called, metathesis, for, example, most, chemical, reactions, are, reversible, that, is, they, can, and, do, run, in, both, directions, the, forward, and, reverse, reactions, are, competing, with, each, other, and, differ, in, reaction, rates, these, rates, depend, on, the, concentration, and, therefore, change, with, the, time, of, the, reaction, the, reverse, rate, gradually, increases, and, becomes, equal, to, the, rate, of, the, forward, reaction, establishing, the, so, called, chemical, equilibrium, the, time, to, reach, equilibrium, depends, on, parameters, such, as, temperature, pressure, and, the, materials, involved, and, is, determined, by, the, minimum, free, energy, in, equilibrium, the, gibbs, free, energy, of, reaction, must, be, zero, the, pressure, dependence, can, be, explained, with, the, le, chatelier, s, principle, for, example, an, increase, in, pressure, due, to, decreasing, volume, causes, the, reaction, to, shift, to, the, side, with, fewer, moles, of, gas, the, reaction, yield, stabilizes, at, equilibrium, but, can, be, increased, by, removing, the, product, from, the, reaction, mixture, or, changed, by, increasing, the, temperature, or, pressure, a, change, in, the, concentrations, of, the, reactants, does, not, affect, the, equilibrium, constant, but, does, affect, the, equilibrium, position, chemical, reactions, are, determined, by, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, reactions, can, proceed, by, themselves, if, they, are, exergonic, that, is, if, they, release, free, energy, the, associated, free, energy, change, of, the, reaction, is, composed, of, the, changes, of, two, different, thermodynamic, quantities, enthalpy, and, entropy, reactions, can, be, exothermic, where, h, is, negative, and, energy, is, released, typical, examples, of, exothermic, reactions, are, combustion, precipitation, and, crystallization, in, which, ordered, solids, are, formed, from, disordered, gaseous, or, liquid, phases, in, contrast, in, endothermic, reactions, heat, is, consumed, from, the, environment, this, can, occur, by, increasing, the, entropy, of, the, system, often, through, the, formation, of, gaseous, or, dissolved, reaction, products, which, have, higher, entropy, since, the, entropy, term, in, the, free, energy, change, increases, with, temperature, many, endothermic, reactions, preferably, take, place, at, high, temperatures, on, the, contrary, many, exothermic, reactions, such, as, crystallization, occur, preferably, at, lower, temperatures, a, change, in, temperature, can, sometimes, reverse, the, sign, of, the, enthalpy, of, a, reaction, as, for, the, carbon, monoxide, reduction, of, molybdenum, dioxide, this, reaction, to, form, carbon, dioxide, and, molybdenum, is, endothermic, at, low, temperatures, becoming, less, so, with, increasing, temperature, h, is, zero, at, 1855, k, and, the, reaction, becomes, exothermic, above, that, temperature, changes, in, temperature, can, also, reverse, the, direction, tendency, of, a, reaction, for, example, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, is, favored, by, low, temperatures, but, its, reverse, is, favored, by, high, temperatures, the, shift, in, reaction, direction, tendency, occurs, at, 1100, k, reactions, can, also, be, characterized, by, their, internal, energy, change, which, takes, into, account, changes, in, the, entropy, volume, and, chemical, potentials, the, latter, depends, among, other, things, on, the, activities, of, the, involved, substances, the, speed, at, which, reactions, take, place, is, studied, by, reaction, kinetics, the, rate, depends, on, various, parameters, such, as, several, theories, allow, calculating, the, reaction, rates, at, the, molecular, level, this, field, is, referred, to, as, reaction, dynamics, the, rate, v, of, a, first, order, reaction, which, could, be, the, disintegration, of, a, substance, a, is, given, by, its, integration, yields, here, k, is, the, first, order, rate, constant, having, dimension, 1, time, t, is, the, concentration, at, a, time, t, and, 0, is, the, initial, concentration, the, rate, of, a, first, order, reaction, depends, only, on, the, concentration, and, the, properties, of, the, involved, substance, and, the, reaction, itself, can, be, described, with, a, characteristic, half, life, more, than, one, time, constant, is, needed, when, describing, reactions, of, higher, order, the, temperature, dependence, of, the, rate, constant, usually, follows, the, arrhenius, equation, where, e, a, is, the, activation, energy, and, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, one, of, the, simplest, models, of, reaction, rate, is, the, collision, theory, more, realistic, models, are, tailored, to, a, specific, problem, and, include, the, transition, state, theory, the, calculation, of, the, potential, energy, surface, the, marcus, theory, and, the, rice, ramsperger, kassel, marcus, rrkm, theory, in, a, synthesis, reaction, two, or, more, simple, substances, combine, to, form, a, more, complex, substance, these, reactions, are, in, the, general, form, a, b, ab, displaystyle, ce, a, b, ab, two, or, more, reactants, yielding, one, product, is, another, way, to, identify, a, synthesis, reaction, one, example, of, a, synthesis, reaction, is, the, combination, of, iron, and, sulfur, to, form, iron, ii, sulfide, 8, fe, s, 8, 8, fes, displaystyle, ce, 8fe, s8, 8fes, another, example, is, simple, hydrogen, gas, combined, with, simple, oxygen, gas, to, produce, a, more, complex, substance, such, as, water, a, decomposition, reaction, is, when, a, more, complex, substance, breaks, down, into, its, more, simple, parts, it, is, thus, the, opposite, of, a, synthesis, reaction, and, can, be, written, as, ab, a, b, displaystyle, ce, ab, a, b, one, example, of, a, decomposition, reaction, is, the, electrolysis, of, water, to, make, oxygen, and, hydrogen, gas, 2, h, 2, o, 2, h, 2, o, 2, displaystyle, ce, 2h2o, 2h2, o2, in, a, single, displacement, reaction, a, single, uncombined, element, replaces, another, in, a, compound, in, other, words, one, element, trades, places, with, another, element, in, a, compound, these, reactions, come, in, the, general, form, of, a, bc, ac, b, displaystyle, ce, a, bc, ac, b, one, example, of, a, single, displacement, reaction, is, when, magnesium, replaces, hydrogen, in, water, to, make, solid, magnesium, hydroxide, and, hydrogen, gas, mg, 2, h, 2, o, mg, oh, 2, h, 2, displaystyle, ce, mg, 2h2o, mg, oh, 2, v, h2, in, a, double, displacement, reaction, the, anions, and, cations, of, two, compounds, switch, places, and, form, two, entirely, different, compounds, these, reactions, are, in, the, general, form, ab, cd, ad, cb, displaystyle, ce, ab, cd, ad, cb, for, example, when, barium, chloride, bacl, 2, and, magnesium, sulfate, mgso, 4, react, the, so, 4, 2, anion, switches, places, with, the, 2cl, anion, giving, the, compounds, baso, 4, and, mgcl, 2, another, example, of, a, double, displacement, reaction, is, the, reaction, of, lead, ii, nitrate, with, potassium, iodide, to, form, lead, ii, iodide, and, potassium, nitrate, pb, no, 3, 2, 2, ki, pbi, 2, 2, kno, 3, displaystyle, ce, pb, no3, 2, 2ki, pbi2, v, 2kno3, according, to, le, chatelier, s, principle, reactions, may, proceed, in, the, forward, or, reverse, direction, until, they, end, or, reach, equilibrium, reactions, that, proceed, in, the, forward, direction, to, approach, equilibrium, are, often, called, spontaneous, reactions, that, is, g, displaystyle, delta, g, is, negative, which, means, that, if, they, occur, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, they, decrease, the, gibbs, free, energy, of, the, reaction, they, do, not, require, much, energy, to, proceed, in, the, forward, direction, most, reactions, are, forward, reactions, examples, reactions, that, proceed, in, the, backward, direction, to, approach, equilibrium, are, often, called, non, spontaneous, reactions, that, is, g, displaystyle, delta, g, is, positive, which, means, that, if, they, occur, at, constant, temperature, and, pressure, they, increase, the, gibbs, free, energy, of, the, reaction, they, require, input, of, energy, to, proceed, in, the, forward, direction, examples, include, in, a, combustion, reaction, an, element, or, compound, reacts, with, an, oxidant, usually, oxygen, often, producing, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, or, light, combustion, reactions, frequently, involve, a, hydrocarbon, for, instance, the, combustion, of, 1, mole, 114, g, of, octane, in, oxygen, c, 8, h, 18, l, 25, 2, o, 2, g, 8, co, 2, 9, h, 2,

from, one, involved, species, reducing, agent, to, another, oxidizing, agent, in, this, process, the, former, species, is, oxidized, and, the, latter, is, reduced, though, sufficient, for, many, purposes, these, descriptions, are, not, precisely, correct, oxidation, is, better, defined, as, an, increase, in, oxidation, state, of, atoms, and, reduction, as, a, decrease, in, oxidation, state, in, practice, the, transfer, of, electrons, will, always, change, the, oxidation, state, but, there, are, many, reactions, that, are, classed, as, redox, even, though, no, electron, transfer, occurs, such, as, those, involving, covalent, bonds, in, the, following, redox, reaction, hazardous, sodium, metal, reacts, with, toxic, chlorine, gas, to, form, the, ionic, compound, sodium, chloride, or, common, table, salt, 2, na, s, cl, 2, g, 2, nacl, s, displaystyle, ce, 2na, s, cl2, g, 2nacl, s, in, the, reaction, sodium, metal, goes, from, an, oxidation, state, of, 0, a, pure, element, to, 1, in, other, words, the, sodium, lost, one, electron, and, is, said, to, have, been, oxidized, on, the, other, hand, the, chlorine, gas, goes, from, an, oxidation, of, 0, also, a, pure, element, to, 1, the, chlorine, gains, one, electron, and, is, said, to, have, been, reduced, because, the, chlorine, is, the, one, reduced, it, is, considered, the, electron, acceptor, or, in, other, words, induces, oxidation, in, the, sodium, thus, the, chlorine, gas, is, considered, the, oxidizing, agent, conversely, the, sodium, is, oxidized, or, is, the, electron, donor, and, thus, induces, a, reduction, in, the, other, species, and, is, considered, the, reducing, agent, which, of, the, involved, reactants, would, be, a, reducing, or, oxidizing, agent, can, be, predicted, from, the, electronegativity, of, their, elements, elements, with, low, electronegativities, such, as, most, metals, easily, donate, electrons, and, oxidize, they, are, reducing, agents, on, the, contrary, many, oxides, or, ions, with, high, oxidation, numbers, of, their, non, oxygen, atoms, such, as, h, 2, o, 2, mno, 4, cro, 3, cr, 2, o, 2, 7, or, oso, 4, can, gain, one, or, two, extra, electrons, and, are, strong, oxidizing, agents, for, some, main, group, elements, the, number, of, electrons, donated, or, accepted, in, a, redox, reaction, can, be, predicted, from, the, electron, configuration, of, the, reactant, element, elements, try, to, reach, the, low, energy, noble, gas, configuration, and, therefore, alkali, metals, and, halogens, will, donate, and, accept, one, electron, respectively, noble, gases, themselves, are, chemically, inactive, the, overall, redox, reaction, can, be, balanced, by, combining, the, oxidation, and, reduction, half, reactions, multiplied, by, coefficients, such, that, the, number, of, electrons, lost, in, the, oxidation, equals, the, number, of, electrons, gained, in, the, reduction, an, important, class, of, redox, reactions, are, the, electrolytic, electrochemical, reactions, where, electrons, from, the, power, supply, at, the, negative, electrode, are, used, as, the, reducing, agent, and, electron, withdrawal, at, the, positive, electrode, as, the, oxidizing, agent, these, reactions, are, particularly, important, for, the, production, of, chemical, elements, such, as, chlorine, or, aluminium, the, reverse, process, in, which, electrons, are, released, in, redox, reactions, and, chemical, energy, is, converted, to, electrical, energy, is, possible, and, used, in, batteries, in, complexation, reactions, several, ligands, react, with, a, metal, atom, to, form, a, coordination, complex, this, is, achieved, by, providing, lone, pairs, of, the, ligand, into, empty, orbitals, of, the, metal, atom, and, forming, dipolar, bonds, the, ligands, are, lewis, bases, they, can, be, both, ions, and, neutral, molecules, such, as, carbon, monoxide, ammonia, or, water, the, number, of, ligands, that, react, with, a, central, metal, atom, can, be, found, using, the, 18, electron, rule, saying, that, the, valence, shells, of, a, transition, metal, will, collectively, accommodate, 18, electrons, whereas, the, symmetry, of, the, resulting, complex, can, be, predicted, with, the, crystal, field, theory, and, ligand, field, theory, complexation, reactions, also, include, ligand, exchange, in, which, one, or, more, ligands, are, replaced, by, another, and, redox, processes, which, change, the, oxidation, state, of, the, central, metal, atom, in, the, br, nsted, lowry, acid, base, theory, an, acid, base, reaction, involves, a, transfer, of, protons, h, from, one, species, the, acid, to, another, the, base, when, a, proton, is, removed, from, an, acid, the, resulting, species, is, termed, that, acid, s, conjugate, base, when, the, proton, is, accepted, by, a, base, the, resulting, species, is, termed, that, base, s, conjugate, acid, in, other, words, acids, act, as, proton, donors, and, bases, act, as, proton, acceptors, according, to, the, following, equation, ha, acid, b, base, a, conjugated, base, hb, conjugated, acid, displaystyle, ce, underset, acid, ha, underset, base, b, underset, conjugated, base, a, underset, conjugated, acid, hb, the, reverse, reaction, is, possible, and, thus, the, acid, base, and, conjugated, base, acid, are, always, in, equilibrium, the, equilibrium, is, determined, by, the, acid, and, base, dissociation, constants, k, a, and, k, b, of, the, involved, substances, a, special, case, of, the, acid, base, reaction, is, the, neutralization, where, an, acid, and, a, base, taken, at, the, exact, same, amounts, form, a, neutral, salt, acid, base, reactions, can, have, different, definitions, depending, on, the, acid, base, concept, employed, some, of, the, most, common, are, precipitation, is, the, formation, of, a, solid, in, a, solution, or, inside, another, solid, during, a, chemical, reaction, it, usually, takes, place, when, the, concentration, of, dissolved, ions, exceeds, the, solubility, limit, and, forms, an, insoluble, salt, this, process, can, be, assisted, by, adding, a, precipitating, agent, or, by, the, removal, of, the, solvent, rapid, precipitation, results, in, an, amorphous, or, microcrystalline, residue, and, a, slow, process, can, yield, single, crystals, the, latter, can, also, be, obtained, by, recrystallization, from, microcrystalline, salts, reactions, can, take, place, between, two, solids, however, because, of, the, relatively, small, diffusion, rates, in, solids, the, corresponding, chemical, reactions, are, very, slow, in, comparison, to, liquid, and, gas, phase, reactions, they, are, accelerated, by, increasing, the, reaction, temperature, and, finely, dividing, the, reactant, to, increase, the, contacting, surface, area, the, reaction, can, take, place, at, the, solid, gas, interface, surfaces, at, very, low, pressure, such, as, ultra, high, vacuum, via, scanning, tunneling, microscopy, it, is, possible, to, observe, reactions, at, the, solid, gas, interface, in, real, space, if, the, time, scale, of, the, reaction, is, in, the, correct, range, reactions, at, the, solid, gas, interface, are, in, some, cases, related, to, catalysis, in, photochemical, reactions, atoms, and, molecules, absorb, energy, photons, of, the, illumination, light, and, convert, it, into, an, excited, state, they, can, then, release, this, energy, by, breaking, chemical, bonds, thereby, producing, radicals, photochemical, reactions, include, hydrogen, oxygen, reactions, radical, polymerization, chain, reactions, and, rearrangement, reactions, many, important, processes, involve, photochemistry, the, premier, example, is, photosynthesis, in, which, most, plants, use, solar, energy, to, convert, carbon, dioxide, and, water, into, glucose, disposing, of, oxygen, as, a, side, product, humans, rely, on, photochemistry, for, the, formation, of, vitamin, d, and, vision, is, initiated, by, a, photochemical, reaction, of, rhodopsin, in, fireflies, an, enzyme, in, the, abdomen, catalyzes, a, reaction, that, results, in, bioluminescence, many, significant, photochemical, reactions, such, as, ozone, formation, occur, in, the, earth, atmosphere, and, constitute, atmospheric, chemistry, in, catalysis, the, reaction, does, not, proceed, directly, but, through, a, reaction, with, a, third, substance, known, as, catalyst, although, the, catalyst, takes, part, in, the, reaction, forming, weak, bonds, with, reactants, or, intermediates, it, is, returned, to, its, original, state, by, the, end, of, the, reaction, and, so, is, not, consumed, however, it, can, be, inhibited, deactivated, or, destroyed, by, secondary, processes, catalysts, can, be, used, in, a, different, phase, heterogeneous, or, in, the, same, phase, homogeneous, as, the, reactants, in, heterogeneous, catalysis, typical, secondary, processes, include, coking, where, the, catalyst, becomes, covered, by, polymeric, side, products, additionally, heterogeneous, catalysts, can, dissolve, into, the, solution, in, a, solid, liquid, system, or, evaporate, in, a, solid, gas, system, catalysts, can, only, speed, up, the, reaction, chemicals, that, slow, down, the, reaction, are, called, inhibitors, substances, that, increase, the, activity, of, catalysts, are, called, promoters, and, substances, that, deactivate, catalysts, are, called, catalytic, poisons, with, a, catalyst, a, reaction, that, is, kinetically, inhibited, by, high, activation, energy, can, take, place, in, the, circumvention, of, this, activation, energy, heterogeneous, catalysts, are, usually, solids, powdered, in, order, to, maximize, their, surface, area, of, particular, importance, in, heterogeneous, catalysis, are, the, platinum, group, metals, and, other, transition, metals, which, are, used, in, hydrogenations, catalytic, reforming, and, in, the, synthesis, of, commodity, chemicals, such, as, nitric, acid, and, ammonia, acids, are, an, example, of, a, homogeneous, catalyst, they, increase, the, nucleophilicity, of, carbonyls, allowing, a, reaction, that, would, not, otherwise, proceed, with, electrophiles, the, advantage, of, homogeneous, catalysts, is, the, ease, of, mixing, them, with, the, reactants, but, they, may, also, be, difficult, to, separate, from, the, products, therefore, heterogeneous, catalysts, are, preferred, in, many, industrial, processes, in, organic, chemistry, in, addition, to, oxidation, reduction, or, acid, base, reactions, a, number, of, other, reactions, can, take, place, which, involves, covalent, bonds, between, carbon, atoms, or, carbon, and, heteroatoms, such, as, oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, etc, many, specific, reactions, in, organic, chemistry, are, name, reactions, designated, after, their, discoverers, one, of, the, most, industrially, important, reactions, is, the, cracking, of, heavy, hydrocarbons, at, oil, refineries, to, create, smaller, simpler, molecules, this, process, is, used, to, manufacture, gasoline, specific, types, of, organic, reactions, may, be, grouped, by, their, reaction, mechanisms, particularly, substitution, addition, and, elimination, or, by, the, types, of, products, they, produce, for, example, methylation, polymerisation, and, halogenation, in, a, substitution, reaction, a, functional, group, in, a, particular, chemical, compound, is, replaced, by, another, group, these, reactions, can, be, distinguished, by, the, type, of, substituting, species, into, a, nucleophilic, electrophilic, or, radical, substitution, in, the, first, type, a, nucleophile, an, atom, or, molecule, with, an, excess, of, electrons, and, thus, a, negative, charge, or, partial, charge, replaces, another, atom, or, part, of, the, substrate, molecule, the, electron, pair, from, the, nucleophile, attacks, the, substrate, forming, a, new, bond, while, the, leaving, group, departs, with, an, electron, pair, the, nucleophile, may, be, electrically, neutral, or, negatively, charged, whereas, the, substrate, is, typically, neutral, or, positively, charged, examples, of, nucleophiles, are, hydroxide, ion, alkoxides, amines, and, halides, this, type, of, reaction, is, found, mainly, in, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, and, rarely, in, aromatic, hydrocarbon, the, latter, have, high, electron, density, and, enter, nucleophilic, aromatic, substitution, only, with, very, strong, electron, withdrawing, groups, nucleophilic, substitution, can, take, place, by, two, different, mechanisms, s, n, 1, and, s, n, 2, in, their, names, s, stands, for, substitution, n, for, nucleophilic, and, the, number, represents, the, kinetic, order, of, the, reaction, unimolecular, or, bimolecular, the, s, n, 1, reaction, proceeds, in, two, steps, first, the, leaving, group, is, eliminated, creating, a, carbocation, this, is, followed, by, a, rapid, reaction, with, the, nucleophile, in, the, s, n, 2, mechanisms, the, nucleophile, forms, a, transition, state, with, the, attacked, molecule, and, only, then, the, leaving, group, is, cleaved, these, two, mechanisms, differ, in, the, stereochemistry, of, the, products, s, n, 1, leads, to, the, non, stereospecific, addition, and, does, not, result, in, a, chiral, center, but, rather, in, a, set, of, geometric, isomers, cis, trans, in, contrast, a, reversal, walden, inversion, of, the, previously, existing, stereochemistry, is, observed, in, the, s, n, 2, mechanism, electrophilic, substitution, is, the, counterpart, of, the, nucleophilic, substitution, in, that, the, attacking, atom, or, molecule, an, electrophile, has, low, electron, density, and, thus, a, positive, charge, typical, electrophiles, are, the, carbon, atom, of, carbonyl, groups, carbocations, or, sulfur, or, nitronium, cations, this, reaction, takes, place, almost, exclusively, in, aromatic, hydrocarbons, where, it, is, called, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, the, electrophile, attack, results, in, the, so, called, complex, a, transition, state, in, which, the, aromatic, system, is, abolished, then, the, leaving, group, usually, a, proton, is, split, off, and, the, aromaticity, is, restored, an, alternative, to, aromatic, substitution, is, electrophilic, aliphatic, substitution, it, is, similar, to, the, nucleophilic, aliphatic, substitution, and, also, has, two, major, types, s, e, 1, and, s, e, 2, in, the, third, type, of, substitution, reaction, radical, substitution, the, attacking, particle, is, a, radical, this, process, usually, takes, the, form, of, a, chain, reaction, for, example, in, the, reaction, of, alkanes, with, halogens, in, the, first, step, light, or, heat, disintegrates, the, halogen, containing, molecules, producing, radicals, then, the, reaction, proceeds, as, an, avalanche, until, two, radicals, meet, and, recombine, the, addition, and, its, counterpart, the, elimination, are, reactions, that, change, the, number, of, substituents, on, the, carbon, atom, and, form, or, cleave, multiple, bonds, double, and, triple, bonds, can, be, produced, by, eliminating, a, suitable, leaving, group, similar, to, the, nucleophilic, substitution, there, are, several, possible, reaction, mechanisms, that, are, named, after, the, respective, reaction, order, in, the, e1, mechanism, the, leaving, group, is, ejected, first, forming, a, carbocation, the, next, step, the, formation, of, the, double, bond, takes, place, with, the, elimination, of, a, proton, deprotonation, the, leaving, order, is, reversed, in, the, e1cb, mechanism, that, is, the, proton, is, split, off, first, this, mechanism, requires, the, participation, of, a, base, because, of, the, similar, conditions, both, reactions, in, the, e1, or, e1cb, elimination, always, compete, with, the, s, n, 1, substitution, the, e2, mechanism, also, requires, a, base, but, there, the, attack, of, the, base, and, the, elimination, of, the, leaving, group, proceed, simultaneously, and, produce, no, ionic, intermediate, in, contrast, to, the, e1, eliminations, different, stereochemical, configurations, are, possible, for, the, reaction, product, in, the, e2, mechanism, because, the, attack, of, the, base, preferentially, occurs, in, the, anti, position, with, respect, to, the, leaving, group, because, of, the, similar, conditions, and, reagents, the, e2, elimination, is, always, in, competition, with, the, s, n, 2, substitution, the, counterpart, of, elimination, is, an, addition, where, double, or, triple, bonds, are, converted, into, single, bonds, similar, to, substitution, reactions, there, are, several, types, of, additions, distinguished, by, the, type, of, the, attacking, particle, for, example, in, the, electrophilic, addition, of, hydrogen, bromide, an, electrophile, proton, attacks, the, double, bond, forming, a, carbocation, which, then, reacts, with, the, nucleophile, bromine, the, carbocation, can, be, formed, on, either, side, of, the, double, bond, depending, on, the, groups, attached, to, its, ends, and, the, preferred, configuration, can, be, predicted, with, the, markovnikov, s, rule, this, rule, states, that, in, the, heterolytic, addition, of, a, polar, molecule, to, an, alkene, or, alkyne, the, more, electronegative, nucleophilic, atom, or, part, of, the, polar, molecule, becomes, attached, to, the, carbon, atom, bearing, the, smaller, number, of, hydrogen, atoms, if, the, addition, of, a, functional, group, takes, place, at, the, less, substituted, carbon, atom, of, the, double, bond, then, the, electrophilic, substitution, with, acids, is, not, possible, in, this, case, one, has, to, use, the, hydroboration, oxidation, reaction, wherein, the, first, step, the, boron, atom, acts, as, electrophile, and, adds, to, the, less, substituted, carbon, atom, in, the, second, step, the, nucleophilic, hydroperoxide, or, halogen, anion, attacks, the, boron, atom, while, the, addition, to, the, electron, rich, alkenes, and, alkynes, is, mainly, electrophilic, the, nucleophilic, addition, plays, an, important, role, in, the, carbon, heteroatom, multiple, bonds, and, especially, its, most, important, representative, the, carbonyl, group, this, process, is, often, associated, with, elimination, so, that, after, the, reaction, the, carbonyl, group, is, present, again, it, is, therefore, called, an, addition, elimination, reaction, and, may, occur, in, carboxylic, acid, derivatives, such, as, chlorides, esters, or, anhydrides, this, reaction, is, often, catalyzed, by, acids, or, bases, where, the, acids, increase, the, electrophilicity, of, the, carbonyl, group, by, binding, to, the, oxygen, atom, whereas, the, bases, enhance, the, nucleophilicity, of, the, attacking, nucleophile, nucleophilic, addition, of, a, carbanion, or, another, nucleophile, to, the, double, bond, of, an, alpha, beta, unsaturated, carbonyl, compound, can, proceed, via, the, michael, reaction, which, belongs, to, the, larger, class, of, conjugate, additions, this, is, one, of, the, most, useful, methods, for, the, mild, formation, of, c, c, bonds, some, additions, which, can, not, be, executed, with, nucleophiles, and, electrophiles, can, be, succeeded, with, free, radicals, as, with, the, free, radical, substitution, the, radical, addition, proceeds, as, a, chain, reaction, and, such, reactions, are, the, basis, of, the, free, radical, polymerization, in, a, rearrangement, reaction, the, carbon, skeleton, of, a, molecule, is, rearranged, to, give, a, structural, isomer, of, the, original, molecule, these, include, hydride, shift, reactions, such, as, the, wagner, meerwein, rearrangement, where, a, hydrogen, alkyl, or, aryl, group, migrates, from, one, carbon, to, a, neighboring, carbon, most, rearrangements, are, associated, with, the, breaking, and, formation, of, new, carbon, carbon, bonds, other, examples, are, sigmatropic, reaction, such, as, the, cope, rearrangement, cyclic, rearrangements, include, cycloadditions, and, more, generally, pericyclic, reactions, wherein, two, or, more, double, bond, containing, molecules, form, a, cyclic, molecule, an, important, example, of, cycloaddition, reaction, is, the, diels, alder, reaction, the, so, called, cycloaddition, between, a, conjugated, diene, and, a, substituted, alkene, to, form, a, substituted, cyclohexene, system, whether, a, certain, cycloaddition, would, proceed, depends, on, the, electronic, orbitals, of, the, participating, species, as, only, orbitals, with, the, same, sign, of, wave, function, will, overlap, and, interact, constructively, to, form, new, bonds, cycloaddition, is, usually, assisted, by, light, or, heat, these, perturbations, result, in, a, different, arrangement, of, electrons, in, the, excited, state, of, the, involved, molecules, and, therefore, in, different, effects, for, example, the, diels, alder, reactions, can, be, assisted, by, heat, whereas, the, cycloaddition, is, selectively, induced, by, light, because, of, the, orbital, character, the, potential, for, developing, stereoisomeric, products, upon, cycloaddition, is, limited, as, described, by, the, woodward, hoffmann, rules, biochemical, reactions, are, mainly, controlled, by, complex, proteins, called, enzymes, which, are, usually, specialized, to, catalyze, only, a, single, specific, reaction, the, reaction, takes, place, in, the, active, site, a, small, part, of, the, enzyme, which, is, usually, found, in, a, cleft, or, pocket, lined, by, amino, acid, residues, and, the, rest, of, the, enzyme, is, used, mainly, for, stabilization, the, catalytic, action, of, enzymes, relies, on, several, mechanisms, including, the, molecular, shape, induced, fit, bond, strain, proximity, and, orientation, of, molecules, relative, to, the, enzyme, proton, donation, or, withdrawal, acid, base, catalysis, electrostatic, interactions, and, many, others, the, biochemical, reactions, that, occur, in, living, organisms, are, collectively, known, as, metabolism, among, the, most, important, of, its, mechanisms, is, the, anabolism, in, which, different, dna, and, enzyme, controlled, processes, result, in, the, production, of, large, molecules, such, as, proteins, and, carbohydrates, from, smaller, units, bioenergetics, studies, the, sources, of, energy, for, such, reactions, important, energy, sources, are, glucose, and, oxygen, which, can, be, produced, by, plants, via, photosynthesis, or, assimilated, from, food, and, air, respectively, all, organisms, use, this, energy, to, produce, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, which, can, then, be, used, to, energize, other, reactions, decomposition, of, organic, material, by, fungi, bacteria, and, other, micro, organisms, is, also, within, the, scope, of, biochemistry, chemical, reactions, are, central, to, chemical, engineering, where, they, are, used, for, the, synthesis, of, new, compounds, from, natural, raw, materials, such, as, petroleum, mineral, ores, and, oxygen, in, air, it, is, essential, to, make, the, reaction, as, efficient, as, possible, maximizing, the, yield, and, minimizing, the, number, of, reagents, energy, inputs, and, waste, catalysts, are, especially, helpful, for, reducing, the, energy, required, for, the, reaction, and, increasing, its, reaction, rate, some, specific, reactions, have, their, niche, applications, for, example, the, thermite, reaction, is, used, to, generate, light, and, heat, in, pyrotechnics, and, welding, although, it, is, less, controllable, than, the, more, conventional, oxy, fuel, welding, arc, welding, and, flash, welding, it, requires, much, less, equipment, and, is, still, used, to, mend, rails, especially, in, remote, areas, mechanisms, of, monitoring, chemical, reactions, depend, strongly, on, the, reaction, rate, relatively, slow, processes, can, be, analyzed, in, situ, for, the, concentrations, and, identities, of, the, individual, ingredients, important, tools, of, real, time, analysis, are, the, measurement, of, ph, and, analysis, of, optical, absorption, color, and, emission, spectra, a, less, accessible, but, rather, efficient, method, is, the, introduction, of, a, radioactive, isotope, into, the, reaction, and, monitoring, how, it, changes, over, time, and, where, it, moves, to, this, method, is, often, used, to, analyze, the, redistribution, of, substances, in, the, human, body, faster, reactions, are, usually, studied, with, ultrafast, laser, spectroscopy, where, utilization, of, femtosecond, lasers, allows, short, lived, transition, states, to, be, monitored, at, a, time, scaled, down, to, a, few, femtoseconds
