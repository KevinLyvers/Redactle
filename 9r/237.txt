an, asteroid, is, a, minor, planet, an, object, that, is, neither, a, true, planet, nor, an, identified, comet, that, orbits, within, the, inner, solar, system, they, are, rocky, metallic, or, icy, bodies, with, no, atmosphere, classified, as, c, type, carbonaceous, m, type, metallic, or, s, type, silicaceous, the, size, and, shape, of, asteroids, vary, significantly, ranging, from, small, rubble, piles, under, a, kilometer, across, and, larger, than, meteoroids, to, ceres, a, dwarf, planet, almost, 1000, km, in, diameter, a, body, is, classified, as, a, comet, not, an, asteroid, if, it, shows, a, coma, tail, when, warmed, by, solar, radiation, although, recent, observations, suggest, a, continuum, between, these, types, of, bodies, of, the, roughly, one, million, known, asteroids, the, greatest, number, are, located, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, approximately, 2, to, 4, au, from, the, sun, in, a, region, known, as, the, main, asteroid, belt, the, total, mass, of, all, the, asteroids, combined, is, only, 3, that, of, earth, s, moon, the, majority, of, main, belt, asteroids, follow, slightly, elliptical, stable, orbits, revolving, in, the, same, direction, as, the, earth, and, taking, from, three, to, six, years, to, complete, a, full, circuit, of, the, sun, asteroids, have, historically, been, observed, from, earth, the, first, close, up, observation, of, an, asteroid, was, made, by, the, galileo, spacecraft, several, dedicated, missions, to, asteroids, were, subsequently, launched, by, nasa, and, jaxa, with, plans, for, other, missions, in, progress, nasa, s, near, shoemaker, studied, eros, and, dawn, observed, vesta, and, ceres, jaxa, s, missions, hayabusa, and, hayabusa2, studied, and, returned, samples, of, itokawa, and, ryugu, respectively, osiris, rex, studied, bennu, collecting, a, sample, in, 2020, which, was, delivered, back, to, earth, in, 2023, nasa, s, lucy, launched, in, 2021, is, tasked, with, studying, ten, different, asteroids, two, from, the, main, belt, and, eight, jupiter, trojans, psyche, launched, october, 2023, aims, to, study, the, metallic, asteroid, psyche, near, earth, asteroids, can, threaten, all, life, on, the, planet, as, in, the, impact, which, may, have, inflicted, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, as, an, experiment, to, meet, this, danger, in, september, 2022, the, double, asteroid, redirection, test, spacecraft, successfully, altered, the, orbit, of, the, non, threatening, asteroid, dimorphos, by, crashing, into, it, in, 2006, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, introduced, the, currently, preferred, broad, term, small, solar, system, body, defined, as, an, object, in, the, solar, system, that, is, neither, a, planet, a, dwarf, planet, nor, a, natural, satellite, this, includes, asteroids, comets, and, more, recently, discovered, classes, according, to, iau, the, term, minor, planet, may, still, be, used, but, generally, small, solar, system, body, will, be, preferred, historically, the, first, discovered, asteroid, ceres, was, at, first, considered, a, new, planet, it, was, followed, by, the, discovery, of, other, similar, bodies, which, with, the, equipment, of, the, time, appeared, to, be, points, of, light, like, stars, showing, little, or, no, planetary, disc, though, readily, distinguishable, from, stars, due, to, their, apparent, motions, this, prompted, the, astronomer, sir, william, herschel, to, propose, the, term, asteroid, coined, in, greek, as, or, asteroeid, s, meaning, star, like, star, shaped, and, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, ast, r, star, planet, in, the, early, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, terms, asteroid, and, planet, not, always, qualified, as, minor, were, still, used, interchangeably, traditionally, small, bodies, orbiting, the, sun, were, classified, as, comets, asteroids, or, meteoroids, with, anything, smaller, than, one, meter, across, being, called, a, meteoroid, the, term, asteroid, never, officially, defined, but, can, be, informally, used, to, mean, an, irregularly, shaped, rocky, body, orbiting, the, sun, that, does, not, qualify, as, a, planet, or, a, dwarf, planet, under, the, iau, definitions, the, main, difference, between, an, asteroid, and, a, comet, is, that, a, comet, shows, a, coma, tail, due, to, sublimation, of, its, near, surface, ices, by, solar, radiation, a, few, objects, were, first, classified, as, minor, planets, but, later, showed, evidence, of, cometary, activity, conversely, some, perhaps, all, comets, are, eventually, depleted, of, their, surface, volatile, ices, and, become, asteroid, like, a, further, distinction, is, that, comets, typically, have, more, eccentric, orbits, than, most, asteroids, highly, eccentric, asteroids, are, probably, dormant, or, extinct, comets, the, minor, planets, beyond, jupiter, s, orbit, are, sometimes, also, called, asteroids, especially, in, popular, presentations, however, it, is, becoming, increasingly, common, for, the, term, asteroid, to, be, restricted, to, minor, planets, of, the, inner, solar, system, therefore, this, article, will, restrict, itself, for, the, most, part, to, the, classical, asteroids, objects, of, the, asteroid, belt, jupiter, trojans, and, near, earth, objects, for, almost, two, centuries, after, the, discovery, of, ceres, in, 1801, all, known, asteroids, spent, most, of, their, time, at, or, within, the, orbit, of, jupiter, though, a, few, such, as, 944, hidalgo, ventured, farther, for, part, of, their, orbit, starting, in, 1977, with, 2060, chiron, astronomers, discovered, small, bodies, that, permanently, resided, further, out, than, jupiter, now, called, centaurs, in, 1992, 15760, albion, was, discovered, the, first, object, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, other, than, pluto, soon, large, numbers, of, similar, objects, were, observed, now, called, trans, neptunian, object, further, out, are, kuiper, belt, objects, scattered, disc, objects, and, the, much, more, distant, oort, cloud, hypothesized, to, be, the, main, reservoir, of, dormant, comets, they, inhabit, the, cold, outer, reaches, of, the, solar, system, where, ices, remain, solid, and, comet, like, bodies, exhibit, little, cometary, activity, if, centaurs, or, trans, neptunian, objects, were, to, venture, close, to, the, sun, their, volatile, ices, would, sublimate, and, traditional, approaches, would, classify, them, as, comets, the, kuiper, belt, bodies, are, called, objects, partly, to, avoid, the, need, to, classify, them, as, asteroids, or, comets, they, are, thought, to, be, predominantly, comet, like, in, composition, though, some, may, be, more, akin, to, asteroids, most, do, not, have, the, highly, eccentric, orbits, associated, with, comets, and, the, ones, so, far, discovered, are, larger, than, traditional, comet, nuclei, other, recent, observations, such, as, the, analysis, of, the, cometary, dust, collected, by, the, stardust, probe, are, increasingly, blurring, the, distinction, between, comets, and, asteroids, suggesting, a, continuum, between, asteroids, and, comets, rather, than, a, sharp, dividing, line, in, 2006, the, iau, created, the, class, of, dwarf, planets, for, the, largest, minor, planets, those, massive, enough, to, have, become, ellipsoidal, under, their, own, gravity, only, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, has, been, placed, in, this, category, ceres, at, about, 975, km, 606, mi, across, despite, their, large, numbers, asteroids, are, a, relatively, recent, discovery, with, the, first, one, ceres, only, being, identified, in, 1801, only, one, asteroid, 4, vesta, which, has, a, relatively, reflective, surface, is, normally, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, dark, skies, when, it, is, favorably, positioned, rarely, small, asteroids, passing, close, to, earth, may, be, briefly, visible, to, the, naked, eye, as, of, april, 2022, the, minor, planet, center, had, data, on, 1, 199, 224, minor, planets, in, the, inner, and, outer, solar, system, of, which, about, 614, 690, had, enough, information, to, be, given, numbered, designations, in, 1772, german, astronomer, johann, elert, bode, citing, johann, daniel, titius, published, a, numerical, procession, known, as, the, titius, bode, law, now, discredited, except, for, an, unexplained, gap, between, mars, and, jupiter, bode, s, formula, seemed, to, predict, the, orbits, of, the, known, planets, he, wrote, the, following, explanation, for, the, existence, of, a, missing, planet, this, latter, point, seems, in, particular, to, follow, from, the, astonishing, relation, which, the, known, six, planets, observe, in, their, distances, from, the, sun, let, the, distance, from, the, sun, to, saturn, be, taken, as, 100, then, mercury, is, separated, by, 4, such, parts, from, the, sun, venus, is, 4, 3, 7, the, earth, 4, 6, 10, mars, 4, 12, 16, now, comes, a, gap, in, this, so, orderly, progression, after, mars, there, follows, a, space, of, 4, 24, 28, parts, in, which, no, planet, has, yet, been, seen, can, one, believe, that, the, founder, of, the, universe, had, left, this, space, empty, certainly, not, from, here, we, come, to, the, distance, of, jupiter, by, 4, 48, 52, parts, and, finally, to, that, of, saturn, by, 4, 96, 100, parts, bode, s, formula, predicted, another, planet, would, be, found, with, an, orbital, radius, near, 2, 8, astronomical, units, au, or, 420, million, km, from, the, sun, the, titius, bode, law, got, a, boost, with, william, herschel, s, discovery, of, uranus, near, the, predicted, distance, for, a, planet, beyond, saturn, in, 1800, a, group, headed, by, franz, xaver, von, zach, editor, of, the, german, astronomical, journal, monatliche, correspondenz, monthly, correspondence, sent, requests, to, 24, experienced, astronomers, whom, he, dubbed, the, celestial, police, asking, that, they, combine, their, efforts, and, begin, a, methodical, search, for, the, expected, planet, although, they, did, not, discover, ceres, they, later, found, the, asteroids, 2, pallas, 3, juno, and, 4, vesta, one, of, the, astronomers, selected, for, the, search, was, giuseppe, piazzi, a, catholic, priest, at, the, academy, of, palermo, sicily, before, receiving, his, invitation, to, join, the, group, piazzi, discovered, ceres, on, 1, january, 1801, he, was, searching, for, the, 87th, of, the, catalogue, of, the, zodiacal, stars, of, mr, la, caille, but, found, that, it, was, preceded, by, another, instead, of, a, star, piazzi, had, found, a, moving, star, like, object, which, he, first, thought, was, a, comet, the, light, was, a, little, faint, and, of, the, colour, of, jupiter, but, similar, to, many, others, which, generally, are, reckoned, of, the, eighth, magnitude, therefore, i, had, no, doubt, of, its, being, any, other, than, a, fixed, star, the, evening, of, the, third, my, suspicion, was, converted, into, certainty, being, assured, it, was, not, a, fixed, star, nevertheless, before, i, made, it, known, i, waited, till, the, evening, of, the, fourth, when, i, had, the, satisfaction, to, see, it, had, moved, at, the, same, rate, as, on, the, preceding, days, piazzi, observed, ceres, a, total, of, 24, times, the, final, time, on, 11, february, 1801, when, illness, interrupted, his, work, he, announced, his, discovery, on, 24, january, 1801, in, letters, to, only, two, fellow, astronomers, his, compatriot, barnaba, oriani, of, milan, and, bode, in, berlin, he, reported, it, as, a, comet, but, since, its, movement, is, so, slow, and, rather, uniform, it, has, occurred, to, me, several, times, that, it, might, be, something, better, than, a, comet, in, april, piazzi, sent, his, complete, observations, to, oriani, bode, and, french, astronomer, j, r, me, lalande, the, information, was, published, in, the, september, 1801, issue, of, the, monatliche, correspondenz, by, this, time, the, apparent, position, of, ceres, had, changed, mostly, due, to, earth, s, motion, around, the, sun, and, was, too, close, to, the, sun, s, glare, for, other, astronomers, to, confirm, piazzi, s, observations, toward, the, end, of, the, year, ceres, should, have, been, visible, again, but, after, such, a, long, time, it, was, difficult, to, predict, its, exact, position, to, recover, ceres, mathematician, carl, friedrich, gauss, then, 24, years, old, developed, an, efficient, method, of, orbit, determination, in, a, few, weeks, he, predicted, the, path, of, ceres, and, sent, his, results, to, von, zach, on, 31, december, 1801, von, zach, and, fellow, celestial, policeman, heinrich, w, m, olbers, found, ceres, near, the, predicted, position, and, thus, recovered, it, at, 2, 8, au, from, the, sun, ceres, appeared, to, fit, the, titius, bode, law, almost, perfectly, however, neptune, once, discovered, in, 1846, was, 8, au, closer, than, predicted, leading, most, astronomers, to, conclude, that, the, law, was, a, coincidence, piazzi, named, the, newly, discovered, object, ceres, ferdinandea, in, honor, of, the, patron, goddess, of, sicily, and, of, king, ferdinand, of, bourbon, three, other, asteroids, 2, pallas, 3, juno, and, 4, vesta, were, discovered, by, von, zach, s, group, over, the, next, few, years, with, vesta, found, in, 1807, no, new, asteroids, were, discovered, until, 1845, amateur, astronomer, karl, ludwig, hencke, started, his, searches, of, new, asteroids, in, 1830, and, fifteen, years, later, while, looking, for, vesta, he, found, the, asteroid, later, named, 5, astraea, it, was, the, first, new, asteroid, discovery, in, 38, years, carl, friedrich, gauss, was, given, the, honor, of, naming, the, asteroid, after, this, other, astronomers, joined, 15, asteroids, were, found, by, the, end, of, 1851, in, 1868, when, james, craig, watson, discovered, the, 100th, asteroid, the, french, academy, of, sciences, engraved, the, faces, of, karl, theodor, robert, luther, john, russell, hind, and, hermann, goldschmidt, the, three, most, successful, asteroid, hunters, at, that, time, on, a, commemorative, medallion, marking, the, event, in, 1891, max, wolf, pioneered, the, use, of, astrophotography, to, detect, asteroids, which, appeared, as, short, streaks, on, long, exposure, photographic, plates, this, dramatically, increased, the, rate, of, detection, compared, with, earlier, visual, methods, wolf, alone, discovered, 248, asteroids, beginning, with, 323, brucia, whereas, only, slightly, more, than, 300, had, been, discovered, up, to, that, point, it, was, known, that, there, were, many, more, but, most, astronomers, did, not, bother, with, them, some, calling, them, vermin, of, the, skies, a, phrase, variously, attributed, to, eduard, suess, and, edmund, weiss, even, a, century, later, only, a, few, thousand, asteroids, were, identified, numbered, and, named, in, the, past, asteroids, were, discovered, by, a, four, step, process, first, a, region, of, the, sky, was, photographed, by, a, wide, field, telescope, or, astrograph, pairs, of, photographs, were, taken, typically, one, hour, apart, multiple, pairs, could, be, taken, over, a, series, of, days, second, the, two, films, or, plates, of, the, same, region, were, viewed, under, a, stereoscope, a, body, in, orbit, around, the, sun, would, move, slightly, between, the, pair, of, films, under, the, stereoscope, the, image, of, the, body, would, seem, to, float, slightly, above, the, background, of, stars, third, once, a, moving, body, was, identified, its, location, would, be, measured, precisely, using, a, digitizing, microscope, the, location, would, be, measured, relative, to, known, star, locations, these, first, three, steps, do, not, constitute, asteroid, discovery, the, observer, has, only, found, an, apparition, which, gets, a, provisional, designation, made, up, of, the, year, of, discovery, a, letter, representing, the, half, month, of, discovery, and, finally, a, letter, and, a, number, indicating, the, discovery, s, sequential, number, example, 1998, fj, 74, the, last, step, is, sending, the, locations, and, time, of, observations, to, the, minor, planet, center, where, computer, programs, determine, whether, an, apparition, ties, together, earlier, apparitions, into, a, single, orbit, if, so, the, object, receives, a, catalogue, number, and, the, observer, of, the, first, apparition, with, a, calculated, orbit, is, declared, the, discoverer, and, granted, the, honor, of, naming, the, object, subject, to, the, approval, of, the, international, astronomical, union, by, 1851, the, royal, astronomical, society, decided, that, asteroids, were, being, discovered, at, such, a, rapid, rate, that, a, different, system, was, needed, to, categorize, or, name, asteroids, in, 1852, when, de, gasparis, discovered, the, twentieth, asteroid, benjamin, valz, gave, it, a, name, and, a, number, designating, its, rank, among, asteroid, discoveries, 20, massalia, sometimes, asteroids, were, discovered, and, not, seen, again, so, starting, in, 1892, new, asteroids, were, listed, by, the, year, and, a, capital, letter, indicating, the, order, in, which, the, asteroid, s, orbit, was, calculated, and, registered, within, that, specific, year, for, example, the, first, two, asteroids, discovered, in, 1892, were, labeled, 1892a, and, 1892b, however, there, were, not, enough, letters, in, the, alphabet, for, all, of, the, asteroids, discovered, in, 1893, so, 1893z, was, followed, by, 1893aa, a, number, of, variations, of, these, methods, were, tried, including, designations, that, included, year, plus, a, greek, letter, in, 1914, a, simple, chronological, numbering, system, was, established, in, 1925, currently, all, newly, discovered, asteroids, receive, a, provisional, designation, such, as, 2002, at, 4, consisting, of, the, year, of, discovery, and, an, alphanumeric, code, indicating, the, half, month, of, discovery, and, the, sequence, within, that, half, month, once, an, asteroid, s, orbit, has, been, confirmed, it, is, given, a, number, and, later, may, also, be, given, a, name, e, g, 433, eros, the, formal, naming, convention, uses, parentheses, around, the, number, e, g, 433, eros, but, dropping, the, parentheses, is, quite, common, informally, it, is, also, common, to, drop, the, number, altogether, or, to, drop, it, after, the, first, mention, when, a, name, is, repeated, in, running, text, in, addition, names, can, be, proposed, by, the, asteroid, s, discoverer, within, guidelines, established, by, the, international, astronomical, union, the, first, asteroids, to, be, discovered, were, assigned, iconic, symbols, like, the, ones, traditionally, used, to, designate, the, planets, by, 1852, there, were, two, dozen, asteroid, symbols, which, often, occurred, in, multiple, variants, in, 1851, after, the, fifteenth, asteroid, eunomia, had, been, discovered, johann, franz, encke, made, a, major, change, in, the, upcoming, 1854, edition, of, the, berliner, astronomisches, jahrbuch, baj, berlin, astronomical, yearbook, he, introduced, a, disk, circle, a, traditional, symbol, for, a, star, as, the, generic, symbol, for, an, asteroid, the, circle, was, then, numbered, in, order, of, discovery, to, indicate, a, specific, asteroid, the, numbered, circle, convention, was, quickly, adopted, by, astronomers, and, the, next, asteroid, to, be, discovered, 16, psyche, in, 1852, was, the, first, to, be, designated, in, that, way, at, the, time, of, its, discovery, however, psyche, was, given, an, iconic, symbol, as, well, as, were, a, few, other, asteroids, discovered, over, the, next, few, years, 20, massalia, was, the, first, asteroid, that, was, not, assigned, an, iconic, symbol, and, no, iconic, symbols, were, created, after, the, 1855, discovery, of, 37, fides, many, asteroids, are, the, shattered, remnants, of, planetesimals, bodies, within, the, young, sun, s, solar, nebula, that, never, grew, large, enough, to, become, planets, it, is, thought, that, planetesimals, in, the, asteroid, belt, evolved, much, like, the, rest, of, objects, in, the, solar, nebula, until, jupiter, neared, its, current, mass, at, which, point, excitation, from, orbital, resonances, with, jupiter, ejected, over, 99, of, planetesimals, in, the, belt, simulations, and, a, discontinuity, in, spin, rate, and, spectral, properties, suggest, that, asteroids, larger, than, approximately, 120, km, 75, mi, in, diameter, accreted, during, that, early, era, whereas, smaller, bodies, are, fragments, from, collisions, between, asteroids, during, or, after, the, jovian, disruption, ceres, and, vesta, grew, large, enough, to, melt, and, differentiate, with, heavy, metallic, elements, sinking, to, the, core, leaving, rocky, minerals, in, the, crust, in, the, nice, model, many, kuiper, belt, objects, are, captured, in, the, outer, asteroid, belt, at, distances, greater, than, 2, 6, au, most, were, later, ejected, by, jupiter, but, those, that, remained, may, be, the, d, type, asteroids, and, possibly, include, ceres, various, dynamical, groups, of, asteroids, have, been, discovered, orbiting, in, the, inner, solar, system, their, orbits, are, perturbed, by, the, gravity, of, other, bodies, in, the, solar, system, and, by, the, yarkovsky, effect, significant, populations, include, the, majority, of, known, asteroids, orbit, within, the, asteroid, belt, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, generally, in, relatively, low, eccentricity, i, e, not, very, elongated, orbits, this, belt, is, estimated, to, contain, between, 1, 1, and, 1, 9, million, asteroids, larger, than, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, in, diameter, and, millions, of, smaller, ones, these, asteroids, may, be, remnants, of, the, protoplanetary, disk, and, in, this, region, the, accretion, of, planetesimals, into, planets, during, the, formative, period, of, the, solar, system, was, prevented, by, large, gravitational, perturbations, by, jupiter, contrary, to, popular, imagery, the, asteroid, belt, is, mostly, empty, the, asteroids, are, spread, over, such, a, large, volume, that, reaching, an, asteroid, without, aiming, carefully, would, be, improbable, nonetheless, hundreds, of, thousands, of, asteroids, are, currently, known, and, the, total, number, ranges, in, the, millions, or, more, depending, on, the, lower, size, cutoff, over, 200, asteroids, are, known, to, be, larger, than, 100, km, and, a, survey, in, the, infrared, wavelengths, has, shown, that, the, asteroid, belt, has, between, 700, 000, and, 1, 7, million, asteroids, with, a, diameter, of, 1, km, or, more, the, absolute, magnitudes, of, most, of, the, known, asteroids, are, between, 11, and, 19, with, the, median, at, about, 16, the, total, mass, of, the, asteroid, belt, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 39, 10, 21, kg, which, is, just, 3, of, the, mass, of, the, moon, the, mass, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, scattered, disk, is, over, 100, times, as, large, the, four, largest, objects, ceres, vesta, pallas, and, hygiea, account, for, maybe, 62, of, the, belt, s, total, mass, with, 39, accounted, for, by, ceres, alone, trojans, are, populations, that, share, an, orbit, with, a, larger, planet, or, moon, but, do, not, collide, with, it, because, they, orbit, in, one, of, the, two, lagrangian, points, of, stability, l, 4, and, l, 5, which, lie, 60, ahead, of, and, behind, the, larger, body, in, the, solar, system, most, known, trojans, share, the, orbit, of, jupiter, they, are, divided, into, the, greek, camp, at, l, 4, ahead, of, jupiter, and, the, trojan, camp, at, l, 5, trailing, jupiter, more, than, a, million, jupiter, trojans, larger, than, one, kilometer, are, thought, to, exist, of, which, more, than, 7, 000, are, currently, catalogued, in, other, planetary, orbits, only, nine, mars, trojans, 28, neptune, trojans, two, uranus, trojans, and, two, earth, trojans, have, been, found, to, date, a, temporary, venus, trojan, is, also, known, numerical, orbital, dynamics, stability, simulations, indicate, that, saturn, and, uranus, probably, do, not, have, any, primordial, trojans, near, earth, asteroids, or, neas, are, asteroids, that, have, orbits, that, pass, close, to, that, of, earth, asteroids, that, actually, cross, earth, s, orbital, path, are, known, as, earth, crossers, as, of, april, 2022, a, total, of, 28, 772, near, earth, asteroids, were, known, 878, have, a, diameter, of, one, kilometer, or, larger, a, small, number, of, neas, are, extinct, comets, that, have, lost, their, volatile, surface, materials, although, having, a, faint, or, intermittent, comet, like, tail, does, not, necessarily, result, in, a, classification, as, a, near, earth, comet, making, the, boundaries, somewhat, fuzzy, the, rest, of, the, near, earth, asteroids, are, driven, out, of, the, asteroid, belt, by, gravitational, interactions, with, jupiter, many, asteroids, have, natural, satellites, minor, planet, moons, as, of, october, 2021, there, were, 85, neas, known, to, have, at, least, one, moon, including, three, known, to, have, two, moons, the, asteroid, 3122, florence, one, of, the, largest, potentially, hazardous, asteroids, with, a, diameter, of, 4, 5, km, 2, 8, mi, has, two, moons, measuring, 100, 300, m, 330, 980, ft, across, which, were, discovered, by, radar, imaging, during, the, asteroid, s, 2017, approach, to, earth, near, earth, asteroids, are, divided, into, groups, based, on, their, semi, major, axis, a, perihelion, distance, q, and, aphelion, distance, q, it, is, unclear, whether, martian, moons, phobos, and, deimos, are, captured, asteroids, or, were, formed, due, to, impact, event, on, mars, phobos, and, deimos, both, have, much, in, common, with, carbonaceous, c, type, asteroids, with, spectra, albedo, and, density, very, similar, to, those, of, c, or, d, type, asteroids, based, on, their, similarity, one, hypothesis, is, that, both, moons, may, be, captured, main, belt, asteroids, both, moons, have, very, circular, orbits, which, lie, almost, exactly, in, mars, s, equatorial, plane, and, hence, a, capture, origin, requires, a, mechanism, for, circularizing, the, initially, highly, eccentric, orbit, and, adjusting, its, inclination, into, the, equatorial, plane, most, probably, by, a, combination, of, atmospheric, drag, and, tidal, forces, although, it, is, not, clear, whether, sufficient, time, was, available, for, this, to, occur, for, deimos, capture, also, requires, dissipation, of, energy, the, current, martian, atmosphere, is, too, thin, to, capture, a, phobos, sized, object, by, atmospheric, braking, geoffrey, a, landis, has, pointed, out, that, the, capture, could, have, occurred, if, the, original, body, was, a, binary, asteroid, that, separated, under, tidal, forces, phobos, could, be, a, second, generation, solar, system, object, that, coalesced, in, orbit, after, mars, formed, rather, than, forming, concurrently, out, of, the, same, birth, cloud, as, mars, another, hypothesis, is, that, mars, was, once, surrounded, by, many, phobos, and, deimos, sized, bodies, perhaps, ejected, into, orbit, around, it, by, a, collision, with, a, large, planetesimal, the, high, porosity, of, the, interior, of, phobos, based, on, the, density, of, 1, 88, g, cm, 3, voids, are, estimated, to, comprise, 25, to, 35, percent, of, phobos, s, volume, is, inconsistent, with, an, asteroidal, origin, observations, of, phobos, in, the, thermal, infrared, suggest, a, composition, containing, mainly, phyllosilicates, which, are, well, known, from, the, surface, of, mars, the, spectra, are, distinct, from, those, of, all, classes, of, chondrite, meteorites, again, pointing, away, from, an, asteroidal, origin, both, sets, of, findings, support, an, origin, of, phobos, from, material, ejected, by, an, impact, on, mars, that, reaccreted, in, martian, orbit, similar, to, the, prevailing, theory, for, the, origin, of, earth, s, moon, asteroids, vary, greatly, in, size, from, almost, 1000, km, for, the, largest, down, to, rocks, just, 1, meter, across, below, which, an, object, is, classified, as, a, meteoroid, the, three, largest, are, very, much, like, miniature, planets, they, are, roughly, spherical, have, at, least, partly, differentiated, interiors, and, are, thought, to, be, surviving, protoplanets, the, vast, majority, however, are, much, smaller, and, are, irregularly, shaped, they, are, thought, to, be, either, battered, planetesimals, or, fragments, of, larger, bodies, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, is, by, far, the, largest, asteroid, with, a, diameter, of, 940, km, 580, mi, the, next, largest, are, 4, vesta, and, 2, pallas, both, with, diameters, of, just, over, 500, km, 300, mi, vesta, is, the, brightest, of, the, four, main, belt, asteroids, that, can, on, occasion, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, on, some, rare, occasions, a, near, earth, asteroid, may, briefly, become, visible, without, technical, aid, see, 99942, apophis, the, mass, of, all, the, objects, of, the, asteroid, belt, lying, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, is, estimated, to, be, 2394, 6, 10, 18, kg, 3, 25, of, the, mass, of, the, moon, of, this, ceres, comprises, 938, 10, 18, kg, about, 40, of, the, total, adding, in, the, next, three, most, massive, objects, vesta, 11, pallas, 8, 5, and, hygiea, 3, 4, brings, this, figure, up, to, a, bit, over, 60, whereas, the, next, seven, most, massive, asteroids, bring, the, total, up, to, 70, the, number, of, asteroids, increases, rapidly, as, their, individual, masses, decrease, the, number, of, asteroids, decreases, markedly, with, increasing, size, although, the, size, distribution, generally, follows, a, power, law, there, are, bumps, at, about, 5, km, and, 100, km, where, more, asteroids, than, expected, from, such, a, curve, are, found, most, asteroids, larger, than, approximately, 120, km, in, diameter, are, primordial, surviving, from, the, accretion, epoch, whereas, most, smaller, asteroids, are, products, of, fragmentation, of, primordial, asteroids, the, primordial, population, of, the, main, belt, was, probably, 200, times, what, it, is, today, three, largest, objects, in, the, asteroid, belt, ceres, vesta, and, pallas, are, intact, protoplanets, that, share, many, characteristics, common, to, planets, and, are, atypical, compared, to, the, majority, of, irregularly, shaped, asteroids, the, fourth, largest, asteroid, hygiea, appears, nearly, spherical, although, it, may, have, an, undifferentiated, interior, like, the, majority, of, asteroids, the, four, largest, asteroids, constitute, half, the, mass, of, the, asteroid, belt, ceres, is, the, only, asteroid, that, appears, to, have, a, plastic, shape, under, its, own, gravity, and, hence, the, only, one, that, is, a, dwarf, planet, it, has, a, much, higher, absolute, magnitude, than, the, other, asteroids, of, around, 3, 32, and, may, possess, a, surface, layer, of, ice, like, the, planets, ceres, is, differentiated, it, has, a, crust, a, mantle, and, a, core, no, meteorites, from, ceres, have, been, found, on, earth, vesta, too, has, a, differentiated, interior, though, it, formed, inside, the, solar, system, s, frost, line, and, so, is, devoid, of, water, its, composition, is, mainly, of, basaltic, rock, with, minerals, such, as, olivine, aside, from, the, large, crater, at, its, southern, pole, rheasilvia, vesta, also, has, an, ellipsoidal, shape, vesta, is, the, parent, body, of, the, vestian, family, and, other, v, type, asteroids, and, is, the, source, of, the, hed, meteorites, which, constitute, 5, of, all, meteorites, on, earth, pallas, is, unusual, in, that, like, uranus, it, rotates, on, its, side, with, its, axis, of, rotation, tilted, at, high, angles, to, its, orbital, plane, its, composition, is, similar, to, that, of, ceres, high, in, carbon, and, silicon, and, perhaps, partially, differentiated, pallas, is, the, parent, body, of, the, palladian, family, of, asteroids, hygiea, is, the, largest, carbonaceous, asteroid, and, unlike, the, other, largest, asteroids, lies, relatively, close, to, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, it, is, the, largest, member, and, presumed, parent, body, of, the, hygiean, family, of, asteroids, because, there, is, no, sufficiently, large, crater, on, the, surface, to, be, the, source, of, that, family, as, there, is, on, vesta, it, is, thought, that, hygiea, may, have, been, completely, disrupted, in, the, collision, that, formed, the, hygiean, family, and, recoalesced, after, losing, a, bit, less, than, 2, of, its, mass, observations, taken, with, the, very, large, telescope, s, sphere, imager, in, 2017, and, 2018, revealed, that, hygiea, has, a, nearly, spherical, shape, which, is, consistent, both, with, it, being, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, or, formerly, being, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, or, with, being, disrupted, and, recoalescing, internal, differentiation, of, large, asteroids, is, possibly, related, to, their, lack, of, natural, satellites, as, satellites, of, main, belt, asteroids, are, mostly, believed, to, form, from, collisional, disruption, creating, a, rubble, pile, structure, measurements, of, the, rotation, rates, of, large, asteroids, in, the, asteroid, belt, show, that, there, is, an, upper, limit, very, few, asteroids, with, a, diameter, larger, than, 100, meters, have, a, rotation, period, less, than, 2, 2, hours, for, asteroids, rotating, faster, than, approximately, this, rate, the, inertial, force, at, the, surface, is, greater, than, the, gravitational, force, so, any, loose, surface, material, would, be, flung, out, however, a, solid, object, should, be, able, to, rotate, much, more, rapidly, this, suggests, that, most, asteroids, with, a, diameter, over, 100, meters, are, rubble, piles, formed, through, the, accumulation, of, debris, after, collisions, between, asteroids, asteroids, become, darker, and, redder, with, age, due, to, space, weathering, however, evidence, suggests, most, of, the, color, change, occurs, rapidly, in, the, first, hundred, thousand, years, limiting, the, usefulness, of, spectral, measurement, for, determining, the, age, of, asteroids, except, for, the, big, four, ceres, pallas, vesta, and, hygiea, asteroids, are, likely, to, be, broadly, similar, in, appearance, if, irregular, in, shape, 50, km, 31, mi, 253, mathilde, is, a, rubble, pile, saturated, with, craters, with, diameters, the, size, of, the, asteroid, s, radius, earth, based, observations, of, 300, km, 190, mi, 511, davida, one, of, the, largest, asteroids, after, the, big, four, reveal, a, similarly, angular, profile, suggesting, it, is, also, saturated, with, radius, size, craters, medium, sized, asteroids, such, as, mathilde, and, 243, ida, that, have, been, observed, up, close, also, reveal, a, deep, regolith, covering, the, surface, of, the, big, four, pallas, and, hygiea, are, practically, unknown, vesta, has, compression, fractures, encircling, a, radius, size, crater, at, its, south, pole, but, is, otherwise, a, spheroid, dawn, spacecraft, revealed, that, ceres, has, a, heavily, cratered, surface, but, with, fewer, large, craters, than, expected, models, based, on, the, formation, of, the, current, asteroid, belt, had, suggested, ceres, should, possess, 10, to, 15, craters, larger, than, 400, km, 250, mi, in, diameter, the, largest, confirmed, crater, on, ceres, kerwan, basin, is, 284, km, 176, mi, across, the, most, likely, reason, for, this, is, viscous, relaxation, of, the, crust, slowly, flattening, out, larger, impacts, asteroids, are, classified, by, their, characteristic, emission, spectra, with, the, majority, falling, into, three, main, groups, c, type, m, type, and, s, type, these, describe, carbonaceous, carbon, rich, metallic, and, silicaceous, stony, compositions, respectively, the, physical, composition, of, asteroids, is, varied, and, in, most, cases, poorly, understood, ceres, appears, to, be, composed, of, a, rocky, core, covered, by, an, icy, mantle, vesta, is, thought, to, have, a, nickel, iron, core, olivine, mantle, and, basaltic, crust, thought, to, be, the, largest, undifferentiated, asteroid, 10, hygiea, seems, to, have, a, uniformly, primitive, composition, of, carbonaceous, chondrite, but, it, may, actually, be, a, differentiated, asteroid, that, was, globally, disrupted, by, an, impact, and, then, reassembled, other, asteroids, appear, to, be, the, remnant, cores, or, mantles, of, proto, planets, high, in, rock, and, metal, most, small, asteroids, are, believed, to, be, piles, of, rubble, held, together, loosely, by, gravity, although, the, largest, are, probably, solid, some, asteroids, have, moons, or, are, co, orbiting, binaries, rubble, piles, moons, binaries, and, scattered, asteroid, families, are, thought, to, be, the, results, of, collisions, that, disrupted, a, parent, asteroid, or, possibly, a, planet, in, the, main, asteroid, belt, there, appear, to, be, two, primary, populations, of, asteroid, a, dark, volatile, rich, population, consisting, of, the, c, type, and, p, type, asteroids, with, albedos, less, than, 0, 10, and, densities, under, 2, 2, g, cm, 3, and, a, dense, volatile, poor, population, consisting, of, the, s, type, and, m, type, asteroids, with, albedos, over, 0, 15, and, densities, greater, than, 2, 7, within, these, populations, larger, asteroids, are, denser, presumably, due, to, compression, there, appears, to, be, minimal, macro, porosity, interstitial, vacuum, in, the, score, of, asteroids, with, masses, greater, than, 10, 10, 18, kg, composition, is, calculated, from, three, primary, sources, albedo, surface, spectrum, and, density, the, last, can, only, be, determined, accurately, by, observing, the, orbits, of, moons, the, asteroid, might, have, so, far, every, asteroid, with, moons, has, turned, out, to, be, a, rubble, pile, a, loose, conglomeration, of, rock, and, metal, that, may, be, half, empty, space, by, volume, the, investigated, asteroids, are, as, large, as, 280, km, in, diameter, and, include, 121, hermione, 268, 186, 183, km, and, 87, sylvia, 384, 262, 232, km, few, asteroids, are, larger, than, 87, sylvia, none, of, them, have, moons, the, fact, that, such, large, asteroids, as, sylvia, may, be, rubble, piles, presumably, due, to, disruptive, impacts, has, important, consequences, for, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, computer, simulations, of, collisions, involving, solid, bodies, show, them, destroying, each, other, as, often, as, merging, but, colliding, rubble, piles, are, more, likely, to, merge, this, means, that, the, cores, of, the, planets, could, have, formed, relatively, quickly, scientists, hypothesize, that, some, of, the, first, water, brought, to, earth, was, delivered, by, asteroid, impacts, after, the, collision, that, produced, the, moon, in, 2009, the, presence, of, water, ice, was, confirmed, on, the, surface, of, 24, themis, using, nasa, s, infrared, telescope, facility, the, surface, of, the, asteroid, appears, completely, covered, in, ice, as, this, ice, layer, is, sublimating, it, may, be, getting, replenished, by, a, reservoir, of, ice, under, the, surface, organic, compounds, were, also, detected, on, the, surface, the, presence, of, ice, on, 24, themis, makes, the, initial, theory, plausible, in, october, 2013, water, was, detected, on, an, extrasolar, body, for, the, first, time, on, an, asteroid, orbiting, the, white, dwarf, gd, 61, on, 22, january, 2014, european, space, agency, esa, scientists, reported, the, detection, for, the, first, definitive, time, of, water, vapor, on, ceres, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, the, detection, was, made, by, using, the, far, infrared, abilities, of, the, herschel, space, observatory, the, finding, is, unexpected, because, comets, not, asteroids, are, typically, considered, to, sprout, jets, and, plumes, according, to, one, of, the, scientists, the, lines, are, becoming, more, and, more, blurred, between, comets, and, asteroids, findings, have, shown, that, solar, winds, can, react, with, the, oxygen, in, the, upper, layer, of, the, asteroids, and, create, water, it, has, been, estimated, that, every, cubic, metre, of, irradiated, rock, could, contain, up, to, 20, litres, study, was, conducted, using, an, atom, probe, tomography, numbers, are, given, for, the, itokawa, s, type, asteroid, acfer, 049, a, meteorite, discovered, in, algeria, in, 1990, was, shown, in, 2019, to, have, an, ultraporous, lithology, upl, porous, texture, that, could, be, formed, by, removal, of, ice, that, filled, these, pores, this, suggests, that, upl, represent, fossils, of, primordial, ice, asteroids, contain, traces, of, amino, acids, and, other, organic, compounds, and, some, speculate, that, asteroid, impacts, may, have, seeded, the, early, earth, with, the, chemicals, necessary, to, initiate, life, or, may, have, even, brought, life, itself, to, earth, an, event, called, panspermia, in, august, 2011, a, report, based, on, nasa, studies, with, meteorites, found, on, earth, was, published, suggesting, dna, and, rna, components, adenine, guanine, and, related, organic, molecules, may, have, been, formed, on, asteroids, and, comets, in, outer, space, in, november, 2019, scientists, reported, detecting, for, the, first, time, sugar, molecules, including, ribose, in, meteorites, suggesting, that, chemical, processes, on, asteroids, can, produce, some, fundamentally, essential, bio, ingredients, important, to, life, and, supporting, the, notion, of, an, rna, world, prior, to, a, dna, based, origin, of, life, on, earth, and, possibly, as, well, the, notion, of, panspermia, asteroids, are, commonly, categorized, according, to, two, criteria, the, characteristics, of, their, orbits, and, features, of, their, reflectance, spectrum, many, asteroids, have, been, placed, in, groups, and, families, based, on, their, orbital, characteristics, apart, from, the, broadest, divisions, it, is, customary, to, name, a, group, of, asteroids, after, the, first, member, of, that, group, to, be, discovered, groups, are, relatively, loose, dynamical, associations, whereas, families, are, tighter, and, result, from, the, catastrophic, break, up, of, a, large, parent, asteroid, sometime, in, the, past, families, are, more, common, and, easier, to, identify, within, the, main, asteroid, belt, but, several, small, families, have, been, reported, among, the, jupiter, trojans, main, belt, families, were, first, recognized, by, kiyotsugu, hirayama, in, 1918, and, are, often, called, hirayama, families, in, his, honor, about, 30, 35, of, the, bodies, in, the, asteroid, belt, belong, to, dynamical, families, each, thought, to, have, a, common, origin, in, a, past, collision, between, asteroids, a, family, has, also, been, associated, with, the, plutoid, dwarf, planet, haumea, some, asteroids, have, unusual, horseshoe, orbits, that, are, co, orbital, with, earth, or, another, planet, examples, are, 3753, cruithne, and, 2002, aa, 29, the, first, instance, of, this, type, of, orbital, arrangement, was, discovered, between, saturn, s, moons, epimetheus, and, janus, sometimes, these, horseshoe, objects, temporarily, become, quasi, satellites, for, a, few, decades, or, a, few, hundred, years, before, returning, to, their, earlier, status, both, earth, and, venus, are, known, to, have, quasi, satellites, such, objects, if, associated, with, earth, or, venus, or, even, hypothetically, mercury, are, a, special, class, of, aten, asteroids, however, such, objects, could, be, associated, with, the, outer, planets, as, well, in, 1975, an, asteroid, taxonomic, system, based, on, color, albedo, and, spectral, shape, was, developed, by, chapman, morrison, and, zellner, these, properties, are, thought, to, correspond, to, the, composition, of, the, asteroid, s, surface, material, the, original, classification, system, had, three, categories, c, types, for, dark, carbonaceous, objects, 75, of, known, asteroids, s, types, for, stony, silicaceous, objects, 17, of, known, asteroids, and, u, for, those, that, did, not, fit, into, either, c, or, s, this, classification, has, since, been, expanded, to, include, many, other, asteroid, types, the, number, of, types, continues, to, grow, as, more, asteroids, are, studied, the, two, most, widely, used, taxonomies, now, used, are, the, tholen, classification, and, smass, classification, the, former, was, proposed, in, 1984, by, david, j, tholen, and, was, based, on, data, collected, from, an, eight, color, asteroid, survey, performed, in, the, 1980s, this, resulted, in, 14, asteroid, categories, in, 2002, the, small, main, belt, asteroid, spectroscopic, survey, resulted, in, a, modified, version, of, the, tholen, taxonomy, with, 24, different, types, both, systems, have, three, broad, categories, of, c, s, and, x, asteroids, where, x, consists, of, mostly, metallic, asteroids, such, as, the, m, type, there, are, also, several, smaller, classes, the, proportion, of, known, asteroids, falling, into, the, various, spectral, types, does, not, necessarily, reflect, the, proportion, of, all, asteroids, that, are, of, that, type, some, types, are, easier, to, detect, than, others, biasing, the, totals, originally, spectral, designations, were, based, on, inferences, of, an, asteroid, s, composition, however, the, correspondence, between, spectral, class, and, composition, is, not, always, very, good, and, a, variety, of, classifications, are, in, use, this, has, led, to, significant, confusion, although, asteroids, of, different, spectral, classifications, are, likely, to, be, composed, of, different, materials, there, are, no, assurances, that, asteroids, within, the, same, taxonomic, class, are, composed, of, the, same, or, similar, materials, active, asteroids, are, objects, that, have, asteroid, like, orbits, but, show, comet, like, visual, characteristics, that, is, they, show, comae, tails, or, other, visual, evidence, of, mass, loss, like, a, comet, but, their, orbit, remains, within, jupiter, s, orbit, like, an, asteroid, these, bodies, were, originally, designated, main, belt, comets, mbcs, in, 2006, by, astronomers, david, jewitt, and, henry, hsieh, but, this, name, implies, they, are, necessarily, icy, in, composition, like, a, comet, and, that, they, only, exist, within, the, main, belt, whereas, the, growing, population, of, active, asteroids, shows, that, this, is, not, always, the, case, the, first, active, asteroid, discovered, is, 7968, elst, pizarro, it, was, discovered, as, an, asteroid, in, 1979, but, then, was, found, to, have, a, tail, by, eric, elst, and, guido, pizarro, in, 1996, and, given, the, cometary, designation, 133p, elst, pizarro, another, notable, object, is, 311p, panstarrs, observations, made, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, revealed, that, it, had, six, comet, like, tails, the, tails, are, suspected, to, be, streams, of, material, ejected, by, the, asteroid, as, a, result, of, a, rubble, pile, asteroid, spinning, fast, enough, to, remove, material, from, it, by, smashing, into, the, asteroid, dimorphos, nasa, s, double, asteroid, redirection, test, spacecraft, made, it, an, active, asteroid, scientists, had, proposed, that, some, active, asteroids, are, the, result, of, impact, events, but, no, one, had, ever, observed, the, activation, of, an, asteroid, the, dart, mission, activated, dimorphos, under, precisely, known, and, carefully, observed, impact, conditions, enabling, the, detailed, study, of, the, formation, of, an, active, asteroid, for, the, first, time, observations, show, that, dimorphos, lost, approximately, 1, million, kilograms, after, the, collision, impact, produced, a, dust, plume, that, temporarily, brightened, the, didymos, system, and, developed, a, 10, 000, kilometer, 6, 200, mi, long, dust, tail, that, persisted, for, several, months, until, the, age, of, space, travel, objects, in, the, asteroid, belt, could, only, be, observed, with, large, telescopes, their, shapes, and, terrain, remaining, a, mystery, the, best, modern, ground, based, telescopes, and, the, earth, orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, can, only, resolve, a, small, amount, of, detail, on, the, surfaces, of, the, largest, asteroids, limited, information, about, the, shapes, and, compositions, of, asteroids, can, be, inferred, from, their, light, curves, variation, in, brightness, during, rotation, and, their, spectral, properties, sizes, can, be, estimated, by, timing, the, lengths, of, star, occultations, when, an, asteroid, passes, directly, in, front, of, a, star, radar, imaging, can, yield, good, information, about, asteroid, shapes, and, orbital, and, rotational, parameters, especially, for, near, earth, asteroids, spacecraft, flybys, can, provide, much, more, data, than, any, ground, or, space, based, observations, sample, return, missions, gives, insights, about, regolith, composition, as, asteroids, are, rather, small, and, faint, objects, the, data, that, can, be, obtained, from, ground, based, observations, gbo, are, limited, by, means, of, ground, based, optical, telescopes, the, visual, magnitude, can, be, obtained, when, converted, into, the, absolute, magnitude, it, gives, a, rough, estimate, of, the, asteroid, s, size, light, curve, measurements, can, also, be, made, by, gbo, when, collected, over, a, long, period, of, time, it, allows, an, estimate, of, the, rotational, period, the, pole, orientation, sometimes, and, a, rough, estimate, of, the, asteroid, s, shape, spectral, data, both, visible, light, and, near, infrared, spectroscopy, gives, information, about, the, object, s, composition, used, to, classify, the, observed, asteroids, such, observations, are, limited, as, they, provide, information, about, only, the, thin, layer, on, the, surface, up, to, several, micrometers, as, planetologist, patrick, michel, writes, mid, to, thermal, infrared, observations, along, with, polarimetry, measurements, are, probably, the, only, data, that, give, some, indication, of, actual, physical, properties, measuring, the, heat, flux, of, an, asteroid, at, a, single, wavelength, gives, an, estimate, of, the, dimensions, of, the, object, these, measurements, have, lower, uncertainty, than, measurements, of, the, reflected, sunlight, in, the, visible, light, spectral, region, if, the, two, measurements, can, be, combined, both, the, effective, diameter, and, the, geometric, albedo, the, latter, being, a, measure, of, the, brightness, at, zero, phase, angle, that, is, when, illumination, comes, from, directly, behind, the, observer, can, be, derived, in, addition, thermal, measurements, at, two, or, more, wavelengths, plus, the, brightness, in, the, visible, light, region, give, information, on, the, thermal, properties, the, thermal, inertia, which, is, a, measure, of, how, fast, a, material, heats, up, or, cools, off, of, most, observed, asteroids, is, lower, than, the, bare, rock, reference, value, but, greater, than, that, of, the, lunar, regolith, this, observation, indicates, the, presence, of, an, insulating, layer, of, granular, material, on, their, surface, moreover, there, seems, to, be, a, trend, perhaps, related, to, the, gravitational, environment, that, smaller, objects, with, lower, gravity, have, a, small, regolith, layer, consisting, of, coarse, grains, while, larger, objects, have, a, thicker, regolith, layer, consisting, of, fine, grains, however, the, detailed, properties, of, this, regolith, layer, are, poorly, known, from, remote, observations, moreover, the, relation, between, thermal, inertia, and, surface, roughness, is, not, straightforward, so, one, needs, to, interpret, the, thermal, inertia, with, caution, near, earth, asteroids, that, come, into, close, vicinity, of, the, planet, can, be, studied, in, more, details, with, radar, it, provides, information, about, the, surface, of, the, asteroid, for, example, can, show, the, presence, of, craters, and, boulders, such, observations, were, conducted, by, the, arecibo, observatory, in, puerto, rico, 305, meter, dish, and, goldstone, observatory, in, california, 70, meter, dish, radar, observations, can, also, be, used, for, accurate, determination, of, the, orbital, and, rotational, dynamics, of, observed, objects, both, space, and, ground, based, observatories, conducted, asteroid, search, programs, the, space, based, searches, are, expected, to, detect, more, objects, because, there, is, no, atmosphere, to, interfere, and, because, they, can, observe, larger, portions, of, the, sky, neowise, observed, more, than, 100, 000, asteroids, of, the, main, belt, spitzer, space, telescope, observed, more, than, 700, near, earth, asteroids, these, observations, determined, rough, sizes, of, the, majority, of, observed, objects, but, provided, limited, detail, about, surface, properties, such, as, regolith, depth, and, composition, angle, of, repose, cohesion, and, porosity, asteroids, were, also, studied, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, such, as, tracking, the, colliding, asteroids, in, the, main, belt, break, up, of, an, asteroid, observing, an, active, asteroid, with, six, comet, like, tails, and, observing, asteroids, that, were, chosen, as, targets, of, dedicated, missions, according, to, patrick, michel, the, internal, structure, of, asteroids, is, inferred, only, from, indirect, evidence, bulk, densities, measured, by, spacecraft, the, orbits, of, natural, satellites, in, the, case, of, asteroid, binaries, and, the, drift, of, an, asteroid, s, orbit, due, to, the, yarkovsky, thermal, effect, a, spacecraft, near, an, asteroid, is, perturbed, enough, by, the, asteroid, s, gravity, to, allow, an, estimate, of, the, asteroid, s, mass, the, volume, is, then, estimated, using, a, model, of, the, asteroid, s, shape, mass, and, volume, allow, the, derivation, of, the, bulk, density, whose, uncertainty, is, usually, dominated, by, the, errors, made, on, the, volume, estimate, the, internal, porosity, of, asteroids, can, be, inferred, by, comparing, their, bulk, density, with, that, of, their, assumed, meteorite, analogues, dark, asteroids, seem, to, be, more, porous, 40, than, bright, ones, the, nature, of, this, porosity, is, unclear, the, first, asteroid, to, be, photographed, in, close, up, was, 951, gaspra, in, 1991, followed, in, 1993, by, 243, ida, and, its, moon, dactyl, all, of, which, were, imaged, by, the, galileo, probe, en, route, to, jupiter, other, asteroids, briefly, visited, by, spacecraft, en, route, to, other, destinations, include, 9969, braille, by, deep, space, 1, in, 1999, 5535, annefrank, by, stardust, in, 2002, 2867, teins, and, 21, lutetia, by, the, rosetta, probe, in, 2008, and, 4179, toutatis, china, s, lunar, orbiter, chang, e, 2, which, flew, within, 3, 2, km, 2, mi, in, 2012, the, first, dedicated, asteroid, probe, was, nasa, s, near, shoemaker, which, photographed, 253, mathilde, in, 1997, before, entering, into, orbit, around, 433, eros, finally, landing, on, its, surface, in, 2001, it, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, successfully, orbit, and, land, on, an, asteroid, from, september, to, november, 2005, the, japanese, hayabusa, probe, studied, 25143, itokawa, in, detail, and, returned, samples, of, its, surface, to, earth, on, 13, june, 2010, the, first, asteroid, sample, return, mission, in, 2007, nasa, launched, the, dawn, spacecraft, which, orbited, 4, vesta, for, a, year, and, observed, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, for, three, years, hayabusa2, a, probe, launched, by, jaxa, 2014, orbited, its, target, asteroid, 162173, ryugu, for, more, than, a, year, and, took, samples, that, were, delivered, to, earth, in, 2020, the, spacecraft, is, now, on, an, extended, mission, and, expected, to, arrive, at, a, new, target, in, 2031, nasa, launched, the, osiris, rex, in, 2016, a, sample, return, mission, to, asteroid, 101955, bennu, in, 2021, the, probe, departed, the, asteroid, with, a, sample, from, its, surface, sample, was, delivered, to, earth, in, september, 2023, the, spacecraft, continues, its, extended, mission, designated, osiris, apex, to, explore, near, earth, asteroid, apophis, in, 2029, in, 2021, nasa, launched, double, asteroid, redirection, test, dart, a, mission, to, test, technology, for, defending, earth, against, potential, hazardous, objects, dart, deliberately, crashed, into, the, minor, planet, moon, dimorphos, of, the, double, asteroid, didymos, in, september, 2022, to, assess, the, potential, of, a, spacecraft, impact, to, deflect, an, asteroid, from, a, collision, course, with, earth, in, october, nasa, declared, dart, a, success, confirming, it, had, shortened, dimorphos, orbital, period, around, didymos, by, about, 32, minutes, nasa, s, lucy, launched, in, 2021, is, a, multiple, asteroid, flyby, probe, focused, on, flying, by, 7, jupiter, trojans, of, varying, types, while, not, yet, set, to, reach, its, first, main, target, 3548, eurybates, until, 2027, it, has, made, a, flyby, of, main, belt, asteroid, 152830, dinkinesh, and, is, set, to, flyby, another, asteroid, 52246, donaldjohanson, in, 2025, the, concept, of, asteroid, mining, was, proposed, in, 1970s, matt, anderson, defines, successful, asteroid, mining, as, the, development, of, a, mining, program, that, is, both, financially, self, sustaining, and, profitable, to, its, investors, it, has, been, suggested, that, asteroids, might, be, used, as, a, source, of, materials, that, may, be, rare, or, exhausted, on, earth, or, materials, for, constructing, space, habitats, materials, that, are, heavy, and, expensive, to, launch, from, earth, may, someday, be, mined, from, asteroids, and, used, for, space, manufacturing, and, construction, as, resource, depletion, on, earth, becomes, more, real, the, idea, of, extracting, valuable, elements, from, asteroids, and, returning, these, to, earth, for, profit, or, using, space, based, resources, to, build, solar, power, satellites, and, space, habitats, becomes, more, attractive, hypothetically, water, processed, from, ice, could, refuel, orbiting, propellant, depots, from, the, astrobiological, perspective, asteroid, prospecting, could, provide, scientific, data, for, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligence, seti, some, astrophysicists, have, suggested, that, if, advanced, extraterrestrial, civilizations, employed, asteroid, mining, long, ago, the, hallmarks, of, these, activities, might, be, detectable, there, is, increasing, interest, in, identifying, asteroids, whose, orbits, cross, earth, s, and, that, could, given, enough, time, collide, with, earth, the, three, most, important, groups, of, near, earth, asteroids, are, the, apollos, amors, and, atens, the, near, earth, asteroid, 433, eros, had, been, discovered, as, long, ago, as, 1898, and, the, 1930s, brought, a, flurry, of, similar, objects, in, order, of, discovery, these, were, 1221, amor, 1862, apollo, 2101, adonis, and, finally, 69230, hermes, which, approached, within, 0, 005, au, of, earth, in, 1937, astronomers, began, to, realize, the, possibilities, of, earth, impact, two, events, in, later, decades, increased, the, alarm, the, increasing, acceptance, of, the, alvarez, hypothesis, that, an, impact, event, resulted, in, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, and, the, 1994, observation, of, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, crashing, into, jupiter, the, u, s, military, also, declassified, the, information, that, its, military, satellites, built, to, detect, nuclear, explosions, had, detected, hundreds, of, upper, atmosphere, impacts, by, objects, ranging, from, one, to, ten, meters, across, all, of, these, considerations, helped, spur, the, launch, of, highly, efficient, surveys, consisting, of, charge, coupled, device, ccd, cameras, and, computers, directly, connected, to, telescopes, as, of, 2011, it, was, estimated, that, 89, to, 96, of, near, earth, asteroids, one, kilometer, or, larger, in, diameter, had, been, discovered, as, of, 29, october, 2018, the, linear, system, alone, had, discovered, 147, 132, asteroids, among, the, surveys, 19, 266, near, earth, asteroids, have, been, discovered, including, almost, 900, more, than, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, in, diameter, in, june, 2018, the, national, science, and, technology, council, warned, that, the, united, states, is, unprepared, for, an, asteroid, impact, event, and, has, developed, and, released, the, national, near, earth, object, preparedness, strategy, action, plan, to, better, prepare, according, to, expert, testimony, in, the, united, states, congress, in, 2013, nasa, would, require, at, least, five, years, of, preparation, before, a, mission, to, intercept, an, asteroid, could, be, launched, various, collision, avoidance, techniques, have, different, trade, offs, with, respect, to, metrics, such, as, overall, performance, cost, failure, risks, operations, and, technology, readiness, there, are, various, methods, for, changing, the, course, of, an, asteroid, comet, these, can, be, differentiated, by, various, types, of, attributes, such, as, the, type, of, mitigation, deflection, or, fragmentation, energy, source, kinetic, electromagnetic, gravitational, solar, thermal, or, nuclear, and, approach, strategy, interception, rendezvous, or, remote, station, strategies, fall, into, two, basic, sets, fragmentation, and, delay, fragmentation, concentrates, on, rendering, the, impactor, harmless, by, fragmenting, it, and, scattering, the, fragments, so, that, they, miss, the, earth, or, are, small, enough, to, burn, up, in, the, atmosphere, delay, exploits, the, fact, that, both, the, earth, and, the, impactor, are, in, orbit, an, impact, occurs, when, both, reach, the, same, point, in, space, at, the, same, time, or, more, correctly, when, some, point, on, earth, s, surface, intersects, the, impactor, s, orbit, when, the, impactor, arrives, since, the, earth, is, approximately, 12, 750, km, in, diameter, and, moves, at, approx, 30, km, per, second, in, its, orbit, it, travels, a, distance, of, one, planetary, diameter, in, about, 425, seconds, or, slightly, over, seven, minutes, delaying, or, advancing, the, impactor, s, arrival, by, times, of, this, magnitude, can, depending, on, the, exact, geometry, of, the, impact, cause, it, to, miss, the, earth, project, icarus, was, one, of, the, first, projects, designed, in, 1967, as, a, contingency, plan, in, case, of, collision, with, 1566, icarus, the, plan, relied, on, the, new, saturn, v, rocket, which, did, not, make, its, first, flight, until, after, the, report, had, been, completed, six, saturn, v, rockets, would, be, used, each, launched, at, variable, intervals, from, months, to, hours, away, from, impact, each, rocket, was, to, be, fitted, with, a, single, 100, megaton, nuclear, warhead, as, well, as, a, modified, apollo, service, module, and, uncrewed, apollo, command, module, for, guidance, to, the, target, the, warheads, would, be, detonated, 30, meters, from, the, surface, deflecting, or, partially, destroying, the, asteroid, depending, on, the, subsequent, impacts, on, the, course, or, the, destruction, of, the, asteroid, later, missions, would, be, modified, or, cancelled, as, needed, the, last, ditch, launch, of, the, sixth, rocket, would, be, 18, hours, prior, to, impact, asteroids, and, the, asteroid, belt, are, a, staple, of, science, fiction, stories, asteroids, play, several, potential, roles, in, science, fiction, as, places, human, beings, might, colonize, resources, for, extracting, minerals, hazards, encountered, by, spacecraft,
