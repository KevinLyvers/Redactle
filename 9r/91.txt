venus, is, the, second, planet, from, the, sun, it, is, a, terrestrial, planet, and, is, the, closest, in, mass, and, size, to, its, orbital, neighbour, earth, venus, is, notable, for, having, the, densest, atmosphere, of, the, terrestrial, planets, composed, mostly, of, carbon, dioxide, with, a, thick, global, sulfuric, acid, cloud, cover, at, the, surface, it, has, a, mean, temperature, of, 737, k, 464, c, 867, f, and, a, pressure, of, 92, times, that, of, earth, s, at, sea, level, these, extreme, conditions, compress, carbon, dioxide, into, a, supercritical, state, close, to, venus, s, surface, internally, venus, has, a, core, mantle, and, crust, venus, lacks, an, internal, dynamo, and, its, weakly, induced, magnetosphere, is, caused, by, atmospheric, interactions, with, the, solar, wind, internal, heat, escapes, through, active, volcanism, resulting, in, resurfacing, instead, of, plate, tectonics, venus, is, one, of, two, planets, in, the, solar, system, the, other, being, mercury, that, have, no, moons, conditions, perhaps, favourable, for, life, on, venus, have, been, identified, at, its, cloud, layers, venus, may, have, had, liquid, surface, water, early, in, its, history, with, a, habitable, environment, before, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, evaporated, any, water, and, turned, venus, into, its, present, state, the, rotation, of, venus, has, been, slowed, and, turned, against, its, orbital, direction, retrograde, by, the, currents, and, drag, of, its, atmosphere, it, takes, 224, 7, earth, days, for, venus, to, complete, an, orbit, around, the, sun, and, a, venusian, solar, year, is, just, under, two, venusian, days, long, the, orbits, of, venus, and, earth, are, the, closest, between, any, two, solar, system, planets, approaching, each, other, in, synodic, periods, of, 1, 6, years, venus, and, earth, have, the, lowest, difference, in, gravitational, potential, of, any, pair, of, solar, system, planets, this, allows, venus, to, be, the, most, accessible, destination, and, a, useful, gravity, assist, waypoint, for, interplanetary, flights, from, earth, venus, figures, prominently, in, human, culture, and, in, the, history, of, astronomy, orbiting, inferiorly, inside, of, earth, s, orbit, it, always, appears, close, to, the, sun, in, earth, s, sky, as, either, a, morning, star, or, an, evening, star, while, this, is, also, true, for, mercury, venus, appears, more, prominent, since, it, is, the, third, brightest, object, in, earth, s, sky, after, the, moon, and, the, sun, in, 1961, venus, became, the, target, of, the, first, interplanetary, flight, venera, 1, followed, by, many, essential, interplanetary, firsts, such, as, the, first, soft, landing, on, another, planet, by, venera, 7, in, 1970, these, probes, demonstrated, the, extreme, surface, conditions, an, insight, that, has, informed, predictions, about, global, warming, on, earth, this, finding, ended, the, theories, and, then, popular, science, fiction, about, venus, being, a, habitable, or, inhabited, planet, venus, is, one, of, the, four, terrestrial, planets, in, the, solar, system, meaning, that, it, is, a, rocky, body, like, earth, it, is, similar, to, earth, in, size, and, mass, and, is, often, described, as, earth, s, sister, or, twin, venus, is, close, to, spherical, due, to, its, slow, rotation, venus, has, a, diameter, of, 12, 103, 6, km, 7, 520, 8, mi, only, 638, 4, km, 396, 7, mi, less, than, earth, s, and, its, mass, is, 81, 5, of, earth, s, making, it, the, third, smallest, planet, in, the, solar, system, conditions, on, the, venusian, surface, differ, radically, from, those, on, earth, because, its, dense, atmosphere, is, 96, 5, carbon, dioxide, with, most, of, the, remaining, 3, 5, being, nitrogen, the, surface, pressure, is, 9, 3, megapascals, 93, bars, and, the, average, surface, temperature, is, 737, k, 464, c, 867, f, above, the, critical, points, of, both, major, constituents, and, making, the, surface, atmosphere, a, supercritical, fluid, out, of, mainly, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, and, some, supercritical, nitrogen, the, venusian, surface, was, a, subject, of, speculation, until, some, of, its, secrets, were, revealed, by, planetary, science, in, the, 20th, century, venera, landers, in, 1975, and, 1982, returned, images, of, a, surface, covered, in, sediment, and, relatively, angular, rocks, the, surface, was, mapped, in, detail, by, magellan, in, 1990, 91, the, ground, shows, evidence, of, extensive, volcanism, and, the, sulphur, in, the, atmosphere, may, indicate, that, there, have, been, recent, eruptions, about, 80, of, the, venusian, surface, is, covered, by, smooth, volcanic, plains, consisting, of, 70, plains, with, wrinkle, ridges, and, 10, smooth, or, lobate, plains, two, highland, continents, make, up, the, rest, of, its, surface, area, one, lying, in, the, planet, s, northern, hemisphere, and, the, other, just, south, of, the, equator, the, northern, continent, is, called, ishtar, terra, after, ishtar, the, babylonian, goddess, of, love, and, is, about, the, size, of, australia, maxwell, montes, the, highest, mountain, on, venus, lies, on, ishtar, terra, its, peak, is, 11, km, 7, mi, above, the, venusian, average, surface, elevation, the, southern, continent, is, called, aphrodite, terra, after, the, greek, mythological, goddess, of, love, and, is, the, larger, of, the, two, highland, regions, at, roughly, the, size, of, south, america, a, network, of, fractures, and, faults, covers, much, of, this, area, there, is, recent, evidence, of, lava, flow, on, venus, 2024, such, as, flows, on, sif, mons, a, shield, volcano, and, on, niobe, planitia, a, flat, plain, there, are, visible, calderas, the, planet, has, few, impact, craters, demonstrating, that, the, surface, is, relatively, young, at, 300, 600, million, years, old, venus, has, some, unique, surface, features, in, addition, to, the, impact, craters, mountains, and, valleys, commonly, found, on, rocky, planets, among, these, are, flat, topped, volcanic, features, called, farra, which, look, somewhat, like, pancakes, and, range, in, size, from, 20, to, 50, km, 12, to, 31, mi, across, and, from, 100, to, 1, 000, m, 330, to, 3, 280, ft, high, radial, star, like, fracture, systems, called, novae, features, with, both, radial, and, concentric, fractures, resembling, spider, webs, known, as, arachnoids, and, coronae, circular, rings, of, fractures, sometimes, surrounded, by, a, depression, these, features, are, volcanic, in, origin, most, venusian, surface, features, are, named, after, historical, and, mythological, women, exceptions, are, maxwell, montes, named, after, james, clerk, maxwell, and, highland, regions, alpha, regio, beta, regio, and, ovda, regio, the, last, three, features, were, named, before, the, current, system, was, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, the, body, which, oversees, planetary, nomenclature, the, longitude, of, physical, features, on, venus, is, expressed, relative, to, its, prime, meridian, the, original, prime, meridian, passed, through, the, radar, bright, spot, at, the, centre, of, the, oval, feature, eve, located, south, of, alpha, regio, after, the, venera, missions, were, completed, the, prime, meridian, was, redefined, to, pass, through, the, central, peak, in, the, crater, ariadne, on, sedna, planitia, the, stratigraphically, oldest, tessera, terrains, have, consistently, lower, thermal, emissivity, than, the, surrounding, basaltic, plains, measured, by, venus, express, and, magellan, indicating, a, different, possibly, a, more, felsic, mineral, assemblage, the, mechanism, to, generate, a, large, amount, of, felsic, crust, usually, requires, the, presence, of, water, ocean, and, plate, tectonics, implying, that, habitable, condition, had, existed, on, early, venus, with, large, bodies, of, water, at, some, point, however, the, nature, of, tessera, terrains, is, far, from, certain, studies, reported, on, 26, october, 2023, suggest, for, the, first, time, that, venus, may, have, had, plate, tectonics, during, ancient, times, and, as, a, result, may, have, had, a, more, habitable, environment, possibly, one, capable, of, sustaining, life, venus, has, gained, interest, as, a, case, for, research, into, the, development, of, earth, like, planets, and, their, habitability, much, of, the, venusian, surface, appears, to, have, been, shaped, by, volcanic, activity, venus, has, several, times, as, many, volcanoes, as, earth, and, it, has, 167, large, volcanoes, that, are, over, 100, km, 60, mi, across, the, only, volcanic, complex, of, this, size, on, earth, is, the, big, island, of, hawaii, 154, more, than, 85, 000, volcanoes, on, venus, were, identified, and, mapped, this, is, not, because, venus, is, more, volcanically, active, than, earth, but, because, its, crust, is, older, and, is, not, subject, to, the, same, erosion, process, earth, s, oceanic, crust, is, continually, recycled, by, subduction, at, the, boundaries, of, tectonic, plates, and, has, an, average, age, of, about, 100, million, years, whereas, the, venusian, surface, is, estimated, to, be, 300, 600, million, years, old, several, lines, of, evidence, point, to, ongoing, volcanic, activity, on, venus, sulfur, dioxide, concentrations, in, the, upper, atmosphere, dropped, by, a, factor, of, 10, between, 1978, and, 1986, jumped, in, 2006, and, again, declined, 10, fold, this, may, mean, that, levels, had, been, boosted, several, times, by, large, volcanic, eruptions, it, has, been, suggested, that, venusian, lightning, discussed, below, could, originate, from, volcanic, activity, i, e, volcanic, lightning, in, january, 2020, astronomers, reported, evidence, that, suggests, that, venus, is, currently, volcanically, active, specifically, the, detection, of, olivine, a, volcanic, product, that, would, weather, quickly, on, the, planet, s, surface, this, massive, volcanic, activity, is, fuelled, by, a, superheated, interior, which, models, say, could, be, explained, by, energetic, collisions, from, when, the, planet, was, young, impacts, would, have, had, significantly, higher, velocity, than, on, earth, both, because, venus, s, orbit, is, faster, due, to, its, closer, proximity, to, the, sun, and, because, objects, would, require, higher, orbital, eccentricities, to, collide, with, the, planet, in, 2008, and, 2009, the, first, direct, evidence, for, ongoing, volcanism, was, observed, by, venus, express, in, the, form, of, four, transient, localized, infrared, hot, spots, within, the, rift, zone, ganis, chasma, near, the, shield, volcano, maat, mons, three, of, the, spots, were, observed, in, more, than, one, successive, orbit, these, spots, are, thought, to, represent, lava, freshly, released, by, volcanic, eruptions, the, actual, temperatures, are, not, known, because, the, size, of, the, hot, spots, could, not, be, measured, but, are, likely, to, have, been, in, the, 800, 1, 100, k, 527, 827, c, 980, 1, 520, f, range, relative, to, a, normal, temperature, of, 740, k, 467, c, 872, f, in, 2023, scientists, reexamined, topographical, images, of, the, maat, mons, region, taken, by, the, magellan, orbiter, using, computer, simulations, they, determined, that, the, topography, had, changed, during, an, 8, month, interval, and, concluded, that, active, volcanism, was, the, cause, almost, a, thousand, impact, craters, on, venus, are, evenly, distributed, across, its, surface, on, other, cratered, bodies, such, as, earth, and, the, moon, craters, show, a, range, of, states, of, degradation, on, the, moon, degradation, is, caused, by, subsequent, impacts, whereas, on, earth, it, is, caused, by, wind, and, rain, erosion, on, venus, about, 85, of, the, craters, are, in, pristine, condition, the, number, of, craters, together, with, their, well, preserved, condition, indicates, the, planet, underwent, a, global, resurfacing, event, 300, 600, million, years, ago, followed, by, a, decay, in, volcanism, whereas, earth, s, crust, is, in, continuous, motion, venus, is, thought, to, be, unable, to, sustain, such, a, process, without, plate, tectonics, to, dissipate, heat, from, its, mantle, venus, instead, undergoes, a, cyclical, process, in, which, mantle, temperatures, rise, until, they, reach, a, critical, level, that, weakens, the, crust, then, over, a, period, of, about, 100, million, years, subduction, occurs, on, an, enormous, scale, completely, recycling, the, crust, venusian, craters, range, from, 3, to, 280, km, 2, to, 174, mi, in, diameter, no, craters, are, smaller, than, 3, km, because, of, the, effects, of, the, dense, atmosphere, on, incoming, objects, objects, with, less, than, a, certain, kinetic, energy, are, slowed, so, much, by, the, atmosphere, that, they, do, not, create, an, impact, crater, incoming, projectiles, less, than, 50, m, 160, ft, in, diameter, will, fragment, and, burn, up, in, the, atmosphere, before, reaching, the, ground, without, data, from, reflection, seismology, or, knowledge, of, its, moment, of, inertia, little, direct, information, is, available, about, the, internal, structure, and, geochemistry, of, venus, the, similarity, in, size, and, density, between, venus, and, earth, suggests, that, they, share, a, similar, internal, structure, a, core, mantle, and, crust, like, that, of, earth, the, venusian, core, is, most, likely, at, least, partially, liquid, because, the, two, planets, have, been, cooling, at, about, the, same, rate, although, a, completely, solid, core, cannot, be, ruled, out, the, slightly, smaller, size, of, venus, means, pressures, are, 24, lower, in, its, deep, interior, than, earth, s, the, predicted, values, for, the, moment, of, inertia, based, on, planetary, models, suggest, a, core, radius, of, 2, 900, 3, 450, km, this, is, in, line, with, the, first, observation, based, estimate, of, 3, 500, km, the, principal, difference, between, the, two, planets, is, the, lack, of, evidence, for, plate, tectonics, on, venus, possibly, because, its, crust, is, too, strong, to, subduct, without, water, to, make, it, less, viscous, this, results, in, reduced, heat, loss, from, the, planet, preventing, it, from, cooling, and, providing, a, likely, explanation, for, its, lack, of, an, internally, generated, magnetic, field, instead, venus, may, lose, its, internal, heat, in, periodic, major, resurfacing, events, in, 1967, venera, 4, found, venus, s, magnetic, field, to, be, much, weaker, than, that, of, earth, this, magnetic, field, is, induced, by, an, interaction, between, the, ionosphere, and, the, solar, wind, rather, than, by, an, internal, dynamo, as, in, the, earth, s, core, venus, s, small, induced, magnetosphere, provides, negligible, protection, to, the, atmosphere, against, solar, and, cosmic, radiation, the, lack, of, an, intrinsic, magnetic, field, on, venus, was, surprising, given, that, it, is, similar, to, earth, in, size, and, was, expected, to, contain, a, dynamo, at, its, core, a, dynamo, requires, three, things, a, conducting, liquid, rotation, and, convection, the, core, is, thought, to, be, electrically, conductive, and, although, its, rotation, is, often, thought, to, be, too, slow, simulations, show, it, is, adequate, to, produce, a, dynamo, this, implies, that, the, dynamo, is, missing, because, of, a, lack, of, convection, in, venus, s, core, on, earth, convection, occurs, in, the, liquid, outer, layer, of, the, core, because, the, bottom, of, the, liquid, layer, is, much, higher, in, temperature, than, the, top, on, venus, a, global, resurfacing, event, may, have, shut, down, plate, tectonics, and, led, to, a, reduced, heat, flux, through, the, crust, this, insulating, effect, would, cause, the, mantle, temperature, to, increase, thereby, reducing, the, heat, flux, out, of, the, core, as, a, result, no, internal, geodynamo, is, available, to, drive, a, magnetic, field, instead, the, heat, from, the, core, is, reheating, the, crust, one, possibility, is, that, venus, has, no, solid, inner, core, or, that, its, core, is, not, cooling, so, that, the, entire, liquid, part, of, the, core, is, at, approximately, the, same, temperature, another, possibility, is, that, its, core, has, already, been, completely, solidified, the, state, of, the, core, is, highly, dependent, on, the, concentration, of, sulphur, which, is, unknown, at, present, another, possibility, is, that, the, absence, of, a, late, large, impact, on, venus, contra, the, earth, s, moon, forming, impact, left, the, core, of, venus, stratified, from, the, core, s, incremental, formation, and, without, the, forces, to, initiate, sustain, convection, and, thus, a, geodynamo, the, weak, magnetosphere, around, venus, means, that, the, solar, wind, is, interacting, directly, with, its, outer, atmosphere, here, ions, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, are, being, created, by, the, dissociation, of, water, molecules, from, ultraviolet, radiation, the, solar, wind, then, supplies, energy, that, gives, some, of, these, ions, sufficient, velocity, to, escape, venus, s, gravity, field, this, erosion, process, results, in, a, steady, loss, of, low, mass, hydrogen, helium, and, oxygen, ions, whereas, higher, mass, molecules, such, as, carbon, dioxide, are, more, likely, to, be, retained, atmospheric, erosion, by, the, solar, wind, could, have, led, to, the, loss, of, most, of, venus, s, water, during, the, first, billion, years, after, it, formed, however, the, planet, may, have, retained, a, dynamo, for, its, first, 2, 3, billion, years, so, the, water, loss, may, have, occurred, more, recently, the, erosion, has, increased, the, ratio, of, higher, mass, deuterium, to, lower, mass, hydrogen, in, the, atmosphere, 100, times, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, solar, system, venus, has, a, dense, atmosphere, composed, of, 96, 5, carbon, dioxide, 3, 5, nitrogen, both, exist, as, supercritical, fluids, at, the, planet, s, surface, with, a, density, 6, 5, that, of, water, and, traces, of, other, gases, including, sulphur, dioxide, the, mass, of, its, atmosphere, is, 92, times, that, of, earth, s, whereas, the, pressure, at, its, surface, is, about, 93, times, that, at, earth, s, a, pressure, equivalent, to, that, at, a, depth, of, nearly, 1, km, 5, 8, mi, under, earth, s, ocean, surfaces, the, density, at, the, surface, is, 65, kg, m, 3, 4, 1, lb, cu, ft, 6, 5, that, of, water, or, 50, times, as, dense, as, earth, s, atmosphere, at, 293, k, 20, c, 68, f, at, sea, level, the, co, 2, rich, atmosphere, generates, the, strongest, greenhouse, effect, in, the, solar, system, creating, surface, temperatures, of, at, least, 735, k, 462, c, 864, f, this, makes, the, venusian, surface, hotter, than, mercury, s, which, has, a, minimum, surface, temperature, of, 53, k, 220, c, 364, f, and, maximum, surface, temperature, of, 700, k, 427, c, 801, f, even, though, venus, is, nearly, twice, mercury, s, distance, from, the, sun, and, thus, receives, only, 25, of, mercury, s, solar, irradiance, because, of, its, runaway, greenhouse, effect, venus, has, been, identified, by, scientists, such, as, carl, sagan, as, a, warning, and, research, object, linked, to, climate, change, on, earth, venus, s, atmosphere, is, rich, in, primordial, noble, gases, compared, to, that, of, earth, this, enrichment, indicates, an, early, divergence, from, earth, in, evolution, an, unusually, large, comet, impact, or, accretion, of, a, more, massive, primary, atmosphere, from, solar, nebula, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, enrichment, however, the, atmosphere, is, depleted, of, radiogenic, argon, a, proxy, for, mantle, degassing, suggesting, an, early, shutdown, of, major, magmatism, studies, have, suggested, that, billions, of, years, ago, venus, s, atmosphere, could, have, been, much, more, like, the, one, surrounding, the, early, earth, and, that, there, may, have, been, substantial, quantities, of, liquid, water, on, the, surface, after, a, period, of, 600, million, to, several, billion, years, solar, forcing, from, rising, luminosity, of, the, sun, and, possibly, large, volcanic, resurfacing, caused, the, evaporation, of, the, original, water, and, the, current, atmosphere, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, was, created, once, a, critical, level, of, greenhouse, gases, including, water, was, added, to, its, atmosphere, although, the, surface, conditions, on, venus, are, no, longer, hospitable, to, any, earth, like, life, that, may, have, formed, before, this, event, there, is, speculation, on, the, possibility, that, life, exists, in, the, upper, cloud, layers, of, venus, 50, km, 30, mi, up, from, the, surface, where, the, atmospheric, conditions, are, the, most, earth, like, in, the, solar, system, with, temperatures, ranging, between, 303, and, 353, k, 30, and, 80, c, 86, and, 176, f, and, the, pressure, and, radiation, being, about, the, same, as, at, earth, s, surface, but, with, acidic, clouds, and, the, carbon, dioxide, air, venus, s, atmosphere, could, also, have, a, potential, thermal, habitable, zone, at, elevations, of, 54, to, 48, km, with, lower, elevations, inhibiting, cell, growth, and, higher, elevations, exceeding, evaporation, temperature, the, putative, detection, of, an, absorption, line, of, phosphine, in, venus, s, atmosphere, with, no, known, pathway, for, abiotic, production, led, to, speculation, in, september, 2020, that, there, could, be, extant, life, currently, present, in, the, atmosphere, later, research, attributed, the, spectroscopic, signal, that, was, interpreted, as, phosphine, to, sulphur, dioxide, or, found, that, in, fact, there, was, no, absorption, line, thermal, inertia, and, the, transfer, of, heat, by, winds, in, the, lower, atmosphere, mean, that, the, temperature, of, venus, s, surface, does, not, vary, significantly, between, the, planet, s, two, hemispheres, those, facing, and, not, facing, the, sun, despite, venus, s, slow, rotation, winds, at, the, surface, are, slow, moving, at, a, few, kilometres, per, hour, but, because, of, the, high, density, of, the, atmosphere, at, the, surface, they, exert, a, significant, amount, of, force, against, obstructions, and, transport, dust, and, small, stones, across, the, surface, this, alone, would, make, it, difficult, for, a, human, to, walk, through, even, without, the, heat, pressure, and, lack, of, oxygen, above, the, dense, co, 2, layer, are, thick, clouds, consisting, mainly, of, sulfuric, acid, which, is, formed, by, sulphur, dioxide, and, water, through, a, chemical, reaction, resulting, in, sulfuric, acid, hydrate, additionally, the, clouds, consist, of, approximately, 1, ferric, chloride, other, possible, constituents, of, the, cloud, particles, are, ferric, sulfate, aluminium, chloride, and, phosphoric, anhydride, clouds, at, different, levels, have, different, compositions, and, particle, size, distributions, these, clouds, reflect, similar, to, thick, cloud, cover, on, earth, about, 70, of, the, sunlight, that, falls, on, them, back, into, space, and, since, they, cover, the, whole, planet, they, prevent, visual, observation, of, venus, s, surface, the, permanent, cloud, cover, means, that, although, venus, is, closer, than, earth, to, the, sun, it, receives, less, sunlight, on, the, ground, with, only, 10, of, the, received, sunlight, reaching, the, surface, resulting, in, average, daytime, levels, of, illumination, at, the, surface, of, 14, 000, lux, comparable, to, that, on, earth, in, the, daytime, with, overcast, clouds, strong, 300, km, h, 185, mph, winds, at, the, cloud, tops, go, around, venus, about, every, four, to, five, earth, days, winds, on, venus, move, at, up, to, 60, times, the, speed, of, its, rotation, whereas, earth, s, fastest, winds, are, only, 10, 20, rotation, speed, the, surface, of, venus, is, effectively, isothermal, it, retains, a, constant, temperature, not, only, between, the, two, hemispheres, but, between, the, equator, and, the, poles, venus, s, minute, axial, tilt, less, than, 3, compared, to, 23, on, earth, also, minimizes, seasonal, temperature, variation, altitude, is, one, of, the, few, factors, that, affect, venusian, temperatures, the, highest, point, on, venus, maxwell, montes, is, therefore, the, coolest, point, on, venus, with, a, temperature, of, about, 655, k, 380, c, 715, f, and, an, atmospheric, pressure, of, about, 4, 5, mpa, 45, bar, in, 1995, the, magellan, spacecraft, imaged, a, highly, reflective, substance, at, the, tops, of, the, highest, mountain, peaks, a, venus, snow, that, bore, a, strong, resemblance, to, terrestrial, snow, this, substance, likely, formed, from, a, similar, process, to, snow, albeit, at, a, far, higher, temperature, too, volatile, to, condense, on, the, surface, it, rose, in, gaseous, form, to, higher, elevations, where, it, is, cooler, and, could, precipitate, the, identity, of, this, substance, is, not, known, with, certainty, but, speculation, has, ranged, from, elemental, tellurium, to, lead, sulfide, galena, although, venus, has, no, seasons, in, 2019, astronomers, identified, a, cyclical, variation, in, sunlight, absorption, by, the, atmosphere, possibly, caused, by, opaque, absorbing, particles, suspended, in, the, upper, clouds, the, variation, causes, observed, changes, in, the, speed, of, venus, s, zonal, winds, and, appears, to, rise, and, fall, in, time, with, the, sun, s, 11, year, sunspot, cycle, the, existence, of, lightning, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, has, been, controversial, since, the, first, suspected, bursts, were, detected, by, the, soviet, venera, probes, in, 2006, 07, venus, express, clearly, detected, whistler, mode, waves, the, signatures, of, lightning, their, intermittent, appearance, indicates, a, pattern, associated, with, weather, activity, according, to, these, measurements, the, lightning, rate, is, at, least, half, that, on, earth, however, other, instruments, have, not, detected, lightning, at, all, the, origin, of, any, lightning, remains, unclear, but, could, originate, from, clouds, or, venusian, volcanoes, in, 2007, venus, express, discovered, that, a, huge, double, atmospheric, polar, vortex, exists, at, the, south, pole, venus, express, discovered, in, 2011, that, an, ozone, layer, exists, high, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, on, 29, january, 2013, esa, scientists, reported, that, the, ionosphere, of, venus, streams, outwards, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, ion, tail, seen, streaming, from, a, comet, under, similar, conditions, in, december, 2015, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, april, and, may, 2016, researchers, working, on, japan, s, akatsuki, mission, observed, bow, shaped, objects, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, this, was, considered, direct, evidence, of, the, existence, of, perhaps, the, largest, stationary, gravity, waves, in, the, solar, system, venus, orbits, the, sun, at, an, average, distance, of, about, 0, 72, au, 108, million, km, 67, million, mi, and, completes, an, orbit, every, 224, 7, days, although, all, planetary, orbits, are, elliptical, venus, s, orbit, is, currently, the, closest, to, circular, with, an, eccentricity, of, less, than, 0, 01, simulations, of, the, early, solar, system, orbital, dynamics, have, shown, that, the, eccentricity, of, the, venus, orbit, may, have, been, substantially, larger, in, the, past, reaching, values, as, high, as, 0, 31, and, possibly, impacting, early, climate, evolution, all, planets, in, the, solar, system, orbit, the, sun, in, an, anticlockwise, direction, as, viewed, from, above, earth, s, north, pole, most, planets, rotate, on, their, axes, in, an, anticlockwise, direction, but, venus, rotates, clockwise, in, retrograde, rotation, once, every, 243, earth, days, the, slowest, rotation, of, any, planet, this, venusian, sidereal, day, lasts, therefore, longer, than, a, venusian, year, 243, versus, 224, 7, earth, days, slowed, by, its, strong, atmospheric, current, the, length, of, the, day, also, fluctuates, by, up, to, 20, minutes, venus, s, equator, rotates, at, 6, 52, km, h, 4, 05, mph, whereas, earth, s, rotates, at, 1, 674, 4, km, h, 1, 040, 4, mph, venus, s, rotation, period, measured, with, magellan, spacecraft, data, over, a, 500, day, period, is, smaller, than, the, rotation, period, measured, during, the, 16, year, period, between, the, magellan, spacecraft, and, venus, express, visits, with, a, difference, of, about, 6, 5, minutes, because, of, the, retrograde, rotation, the, length, of, a, solar, day, on, venus, is, significantly, shorter, than, the, sidereal, day, at, 116, 75, earth, days, making, the, venusian, solar, day, shorter, than, mercury, s, 176, earth, days, the, 116, day, figure, is, close, to, the, average, number, of, days, it, takes, mercury, to, slip, underneath, the, earth, in, its, orbit, the, number, of, days, of, mercury, s, synodic, orbital, period, one, venusian, year, is, about, 1, 92, venusian, solar, days, to, an, observer, on, the, surface, of, venus, the, sun, would, rise, in, the, west, and, set, in, the, east, although, venus, s, opaque, clouds, prevent, observing, the, sun, from, the, planet, s, surface, venus, may, have, formed, from, the, solar, nebula, with, a, different, rotation, period, and, obliquity, reaching, its, current, state, because, of, chaotic, spin, changes, caused, by, planetary, perturbations, and, tidal, effects, on, its, dense, atmosphere, a, change, that, would, have, occurred, over, the, course, of, billions, of, years, the, rotation, period, of, venus, may, represent, an, equilibrium, state, between, tidal, locking, to, the, sun, s, gravitation, which, tends, to, slow, rotation, and, an, atmospheric, tide, created, by, solar, heating, of, the, thick, venusian, atmosphere, the, 584, day, average, interval, between, successive, close, approaches, to, earth, is, almost, exactly, equal, to, 5, venusian, solar, days, 5, 001444, to, be, precise, but, the, hypothesis, of, a, spin, orbit, resonance, with, earth, has, been, discounted, venus, has, no, natural, satellites, it, has, several, trojan, asteroids, the, quasi, satellite, 524522, zoozve, and, two, other, temporary, trojans, 2001, ck, 32, and, 2012, xe, 133, in, the, 17th, century, giovanni, cassini, reported, a, moon, orbiting, venus, which, was, named, neith, and, numerous, sightings, were, reported, over, the, following, 200, years, but, most, were, determined, to, be, stars, in, the, vicinity, alex, alemi, s, and, david, stevenson, s, 2006, study, of, models, of, the, early, solar, system, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, shows, venus, likely, had, at, least, one, moon, created, by, a, huge, impact, event, billions, of, years, ago, about, 10, million, years, later, according, to, the, study, another, impact, reversed, the, planet, s, spin, direction, and, the, resulting, tidal, deceleration, caused, the, venusian, moon, gradually, to, spiral, inward, until, it, collided, with, venus, if, later, impacts, created, moons, these, were, removed, in, the, same, way, an, alternative, explanation, for, the, lack, of, satellites, is, the, effect, of, strong, solar, tides, which, can, destabilize, large, satellites, orbiting, the, inner, terrestrial, planets, the, orbital, space, of, venus, has, a, dust, ring, cloud, with, a, suspected, origin, either, from, venus, trailing, asteroids, interplanetary, dust, migrating, in, waves, or, the, remains, of, the, solar, system, s, original, circumstellar, disc, that, formed, the, planetary, system, earth, and, venus, have, a, near, orbital, resonance, of, 13, 8, earth, orbits, eight, times, for, every, 13, orbits, of, venus, therefore, they, approach, each, other, and, reach, inferior, conjunction, in, synodic, periods, of, 584, days, on, average, the, path, that, venus, makes, in, relation, to, earth, viewed, geocentrically, draws, a, pentagram, over, five, synodic, periods, shifting, every, period, by, 144, this, pentagram, of, venus, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, petals, of, venus, due, to, the, path, s, visual, similarity, to, a, flower, when, venus, lies, between, earth, and, the, sun, in, inferior, conjunction, it, makes, the, closest, approach, to, earth, of, any, planet, at, an, average, distance, of, 41, million, km, 25, million, mi, because, of, the, decreasing, eccentricity, of, earth, s, orbit, the, minimum, distances, will, become, greater, over, tens, of, thousands, of, years, from, the, year, 1, to, 5383, there, are, 526, approaches, less, than, 40, million, km, 25, million, mi, then, there, are, none, for, about, 60, 158, years, while, venus, approaches, earth, the, closest, mercury, is, more, often, the, closest, to, earth, of, all, planets, venus, has, the, lowest, gravitational, potential, difference, to, earth, than, any, other, planet, needing, the, lowest, delta, v, to, transfer, between, them, tidally, venus, exerts, the, third, strongest, tidal, force, on, earth, after, the, moon, and, the, sun, though, significantly, less, to, the, naked, eye, venus, appears, as, a, white, point, of, light, brighter, than, any, other, planet, or, star, apart, from, the, sun, the, planet, s, mean, apparent, magnitude, is, 4, 14, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 0, 31, the, brightest, magnitude, occurs, during, the, crescent, phase, about, one, month, before, or, after, an, inferior, conjunction, venus, fades, to, about, magnitude, 3, when, it, is, backlit, by, the, sun, the, planet, is, bright, enough, to, be, seen, in, broad, daylight, but, is, more, easily, visible, when, the, sun, is, low, on, the, horizon, or, setting, as, an, inferior, planet, it, always, lies, within, about, 47, of, the, sun, venus, overtakes, earth, every, 584, days, as, it, orbits, the, sun, as, it, does, so, it, changes, from, the, evening, star, visible, after, sunset, to, the, morning, star, visible, before, sunrise, although, mercury, the, other, inferior, planet, reaches, a, maximum, elongation, of, only, 28, and, is, often, difficult, to, discern, in, twilight, venus, is, hard, to, miss, when, it, is, at, its, brightest, its, greater, maximum, elongation, means, it, is, visible, in, dark, skies, long, after, sunset, as, the, brightest, point, like, object, in, the, sky, venus, is, a, commonly, misreported, unidentified, flying, object, as, it, orbits, the, sun, venus, displays, phases, like, those, of, the, moon, in, a, telescopic, view, the, planet, appears, as, a, small, and, full, disc, when, it, is, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, at, superior, conjunction, venus, shows, a, larger, disc, and, quarter, phase, at, its, maximum, elongations, from, the, sun, and, appears, at, its, brightest, in, the, night, sky, the, planet, presents, a, much, larger, thin, crescent, in, telescopic, views, as, it, passes, along, the, near, side, between, earth, and, the, sun, venus, displays, its, largest, size, and, new, phase, when, it, is, between, earth, and, the, sun, at, inferior, conjunction, its, atmosphere, is, visible, through, telescopes, by, the, halo, of, sunlight, refracted, around, it, the, phases, are, clearly, visible, in, a, 4, telescope, although, naked, eye, visibility, of, venus, s, phases, is, disputed, records, exist, of, observations, of, its, crescent, when, venus, is, sufficiently, bright, with, enough, angular, distance, from, the, sun, it, is, easily, observed, in, a, clear, daytime, sky, with, the, naked, eye, though, most, people, do, not, know, to, look, for, it, astronomer, edmund, halley, calculated, its, maximum, naked, eye, brightness, in, 1716, when, many, londoners, were, alarmed, by, its, appearance, in, the, daytime, french, emperor, napoleon, bonaparte, once, witnessed, a, daytime, apparition, of, the, planet, while, at, a, reception, in, luxembourg, another, historical, daytime, observation, of, the, planet, took, place, during, the, inauguration, of, the, american, president, abraham, lincoln, in, washington, d, c, on, 4, march, 1865, a, transit, of, venus, is, the, appearance, of, venus, in, front, of, the, sun, during, inferior, conjunction, since, the, orbit, of, venus, is, slightly, inclined, relative, to, earth, s, orbit, most, inferior, conjunctions, with, earth, which, occur, every, synodic, period, of, 1, 6, years, do, not, produce, a, transit, of, venus, above, earth, consequently, venus, transits, above, earth, only, occur, when, an, inferior, conjunction, takes, place, during, some, days, of, june, or, december, the, time, where, the, orbits, of, venus, and, earth, cross, a, straight, line, with, the, sun, this, results, in, venus, transiting, above, earth, in, a, sequence, of, currently, 8, years, 105, 5, years, 8, years, and, 121, 5, years, forming, cycles, of, 243, years, historically, transits, of, venus, were, important, because, they, allowed, astronomers, to, determine, the, size, of, the, astronomical, unit, and, hence, the, size, of, the, solar, system, as, shown, by, jeremiah, horrocks, in, 1639, with, the, first, known, observation, of, a, venus, transit, after, history, s, first, observed, planetary, transit, in, 1631, of, mercury, only, seven, venus, transits, have, been, observed, so, far, since, their, occurrences, were, calculated, in, the, 1621, by, johannes, kepler, captain, cook, sailed, to, tahiti, in, 1768, to, record, the, third, observed, transit, of, venus, which, subsequently, resulted, in, the, exploration, of, the, east, coast, of, australia, the, latest, pair, was, june, 8, 2004, and, june, 5, 6, 2012, the, transit, could, be, watched, live, from, many, online, outlets, or, observed, locally, with, the, right, equipment, and, conditions, the, preceding, pair, of, transits, occurred, in, december, 1874, and, december, 1882, the, next, transit, will, occur, in, december, 2117, and, december, 2125, a, long, standing, mystery, of, venus, observations, is, the, so, called, ashen, light, an, apparent, weak, illumination, of, its, dark, side, seen, when, the, planet, is, in, the, crescent, phase, the, first, claimed, observation, of, ashen, light, was, made, in, 1643, but, the, existence, of, the, illumination, has, never, been, reliably, confirmed, observers, have, speculated, it, may, result, from, electrical, activity, in, the, venusian, atmosphere, but, it, could, be, illusory, resulting, from, the, physiological, effect, of, observing, a, bright, crescent, shaped, object, the, ashen, light, has, often, been, sighted, when, venus, is, in, the, evening, sky, when, the, evening, terminator, of, the, planet, is, towards, earth, venus, is, in, earth, s, sky, bright, enough, to, be, visible, without, aid, making, it, one, of, the, classical, planets, that, human, cultures, have, known, and, identified, throughout, history, particularly, for, being, the, third, brightest, object, in, earth, s, sky, after, the, sun, and, the, moon, because, the, movements, of, venus, appear, to, be, discontinuous, it, disappears, due, to, its, proximity, to, the, sun, for, many, days, at, a, time, and, then, reappears, on, the, other, horizon, some, cultures, did, not, recognize, venus, as, a, single, entity, instead, they, assumed, it, to, be, two, separate, stars, on, each, horizon, the, morning, and, evening, star, nonetheless, a, cylinder, seal, from, the, jemdet, nasr, period, and, the, venus, tablet, of, ammisaduqa, from, the, first, babylonian, dynasty, indicate, that, the, ancient, sumerians, already, knew, that, the, morning, and, evening, stars, were, the, same, celestial, object, in, the, old, babylonian, period, the, planet, venus, was, known, as, ninsi, anna, and, later, as, dilbat, the, name, ninsi, anna, translates, to, divine, lady, illumination, of, heaven, which, refers, to, venus, as, the, brightest, visible, star, earlier, spellings, of, the, name, were, written, with, the, cuneiform, sign, si4, su, meaning, to, be, red, and, the, original, meaning, may, have, been, divine, lady, of, the, redness, of, heaven, in, reference, to, the, colour, of, the, morning, and, evening, sky, the, chinese, historically, referred, to, the, morning, venus, as, the, great, white, t, ib, i, or, the, opener, starter, of, brightness, q, m, ng, and, the, evening, venus, as, the, excellent, west, one, ch, ngg, ng, the, ancient, greeks, initially, believed, venus, to, be, two, separate, stars, phosphorus, the, morning, star, and, hesperus, the, evening, star, pliny, the, elder, credited, the, realization, that, they, were, a, single, object, to, pythagoras, in, the, sixth, century, bc, while, diogenes, la, rtius, argued, that, parmenides, early, fifth, century, was, probably, responsible, for, this, discovery, though, they, recognized, venus, as, a, single, object, the, ancient, romans, continued, to, designate, the, morning, aspect, of, venus, as, lucifer, literally, light, bringer, and, the, evening, aspect, as, vesper, both, of, which, are, literal, translations, of, their, traditional, greek, names, in, the, second, century, in, his, astronomical, treatise, almagest, ptolemy, theorized, that, both, mercury, and, venus, were, located, between, the, sun, and, the, earth, the, 11th, century, persian, astronomer, avicenna, claimed, to, have, observed, a, transit, of, venus, although, there, is, some, doubt, about, it, which, later, astronomers, took, as, confirmation, of, ptolemy, s, theory, in, the, 12th, century, the, andalusian, astronomer, ibn, bajjah, observed, two, planets, as, black, spots, on, the, face, of, the, sun, these, were, thought, to, be, the, transits, of, venus, and, mercury, by, 13th, century, maragha, astronomer, qotb, al, din, shirazi, though, this, cannot, be, true, as, there, were, no, venus, transits, in, ibn, bajjah, s, lifetime, when, the, italian, physicist, galileo, galilei, first, observed, the, planet, with, a, telescope, in, the, early, 17th, century, he, found, it, showed, phases, like, the, moon, varying, from, crescent, to, gibbous, to, full, and, vice, versa, when, venus, is, furthest, from, the, sun, in, the, sky, it, shows, a, half, lit, phase, and, when, it, is, closest, to, the, sun, in, the, sky, it, shows, as, a, crescent, or, full, phase, this, could, be, possible, only, if, venus, orbited, the, sun, and, this, was, among, the, first, observations, to, clearly, contradict, the, ptolemaic, geocentric, model, that, the, solar, system, was, concentric, and, centred, on, earth, the, 1639, transit, of, venus, was, accurately, predicted, by, jeremiah, horrocks, and, observed, by, him, and, his, friend, william, crabtree, at, each, of, their, respective, homes, on, 4, december, 1639, 24, november, under, the, julian, calendar, in, use, at, that, time, the, atmosphere, of, venus, was, discovered, in, 1761, by, russian, polymath, mikhail, lomonosov, venus, s, atmosphere, was, observed, in, 1790, by, german, astronomer, johann, schr, ter, schr, ter, found, when, the, planet, was, a, thin, crescent, the, cusps, extended, through, more, than, 180, he, correctly, surmised, this, was, due, to, scattering, of, sunlight, in, a, dense, atmosphere, later, american, astronomer, chester, smith, lyman, observed, a, complete, ring, around, the, dark, side, of, the, planet, when, it, was, at, inferior, conjunction, providing, further, evidence, for, an, atmosphere, the, atmosphere, complicated, efforts, to, determine, a, rotation, period, for, the, planet, and, observers, such, as, italian, born, astronomer, giovanni, cassini, and, schr, ter, incorrectly, estimated, periods, of, about, 24, h, from, the, motions, of, markings, on, the, planet, s, apparent, surface, little, more, was, discovered, about, venus, until, the, 20th, century, its, almost, featureless, disc, gave, no, hint, what, its, surface, might, be, like, and, it, was, only, with, the, development, of, spectroscopic, and, ultraviolet, observations, that, more, of, its, secrets, were, revealed, spectroscopic, observations, in, the, 1900s, gave, the, first, clues, about, the, venusian, rotation, vesto, slipher, tried, to, measure, the, doppler, shift, of, light, from, venus, but, found, he, could, not, detect, any, rotation, he, surmised, the, planet, must, have, a, much, longer, rotation, period, than, had, previously, been, thought, the, first, ultraviolet, observations, were, carried, out, in, the, 1920s, when, frank, e, ross, found, that, ultraviolet, photographs, revealed, considerable, detail, that, was, absent, in, visible, and, infrared, radiation, he, suggested, this, was, due, to, a, dense, yellow, lower, atmosphere, with, high, cirrus, clouds, above, it, it, had, been, noted, that, venus, had, no, discernible, oblateness, in, its, disk, suggesting, a, slow, rotation, and, some, astronomers, concluded, based, on, this, that, it, was, tidally, locked, like, mercury, was, believed, to, be, at, the, time, but, other, researchers, had, detected, a, significant, quantity, of, heat, coming, from, the, planet, s, nightside, suggesting, a, quick, rotation, a, high, surface, temperature, was, not, suspected, at, the, time, confusing, the, issue, later, work, in, the, 1950s, showed, the, rotation, was, retrograde, humanity, s, first, interplanetary, spaceflight, was, achieved, in, 1961, with, the, robotic, space, probe, venera, 1, of, the, soviet, venera, programme, flying, to, venus, but, it, lost, contact, en, route, the, first, successful, interplanetary, mission, also, to, venus, was, mariner, 2, of, the, united, states, mariner, programme, passing, on, 14, december, 1962, at, 34, 833, km, 21, 644, mi, above, the, surface, of, venus, and, gathering, data, on, the, planet, s, atmosphere, additionally, radar, observations, of, venus, were, first, carried, out, in, the, 1960s, and, provided, the, first, measurements, of, the, rotation, period, which, were, close, to, the, actual, value, venera, 3, launched, in, 1966, became, humanity, s, first, probe, and, lander, to, reach, and, impact, another, celestial, body, other, than, the, moon, but, could, not, return, data, as, it, crashed, into, the, surface, of, venus, in, 1967, venera, 4, was, launched, and, successfully, deployed, science, experiments, in, the, venusian, atmosphere, before, impacting, venera, 4, showed, the, surface, temperature, was, hotter, than, mariner, 2, had, calculated, at, almost, 500, c, 932, f, determined, that, the, atmosphere, was, 95, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, discovered, that, venus, s, atmosphere, was, considerably, denser, than, venera, 4, s, designers, had, anticipated, in, an, early, example, of, space, cooperation, the, data, of, venera, 4, was, joined, with, the, 1967, mariner, 5, data, analysed, by, a, combined, soviet, american, science, team, in, a, series, of, colloquia, over, the, following, year, on, 15, december, 1970, venera, 7, became, the, first, spacecraft, to, soft, land, on, another, planet, and, the, first, to, transmit, data, from, there, back, to, earth, in, 1974, mariner, 10, swung, by, venus, to, bend, its, path, towards, mercury, and, took, ultraviolet, photographs, of, the, clouds, revealing, the, extraordinarily, high, wind, speeds, in, the, venusian, atmosphere, this, was, the, first, interplanetary, gravity, assist, ever, used, a, technique, which, would, be, used, by, later, probes, radar, observations, in, the, 1970s, revealed, details, of, the, venusian, surface, for, the, first, time, pulses, of, radio, waves, were, beamed, at, the, planet, using, the, 300, m, 1, 000, ft, radio, telescope, at, arecibo, observatory, and, the, echoes, revealed, two, highly, reflective, regions, designated, the, alpha, and, beta, regions, the, observations, revealed, a, bright, region, attributed, to, mountains, which, was, called, maxwell, montes, these, three, features, are, now, the, only, ones, on, venus, that, do, not, have, female, names, in, 1975, the, soviet, venera, 9, and, 10, landers, transmitted, the, first, images, from, the, surface, of, venus, which, were, in, black, and, white, nasa, obtained, additional, data, with, the, pioneer, venus, project, consisting, of, two, separate, missions, the, pioneer, venus, multiprobe, and, pioneer, venus, orbiter, orbiting, venus, between, 1978, and, 1992, in, 1982, the, first, colour, images, of, the, surface, were, obtained, with, the, soviet, venera, 13, and, 14, landers, after, venera, 15, and, 16, operated, between, 1983, and, 1984, in, orbit, conducting, detailed, mapping, of, 25, of, venus, s, terrain, from, the, north, pole, to, 30, n, latitude, the, soviet, venera, programme, came, to, a, close, in, 1985, the, soviet, vega, programme, with, its, vega, 1, and, vega, 2, missions, carried, the, last, entry, probes, and, carried, the, first, ever, extraterrestrial, aerobots, for, the, first, time, achieving, atmospheric, flight, outside, earth, by, employing, inflatable, balloons, between, 1990, and, 1994, magellan, operated, in, orbit, until, deorbiting, mapping, the, surface, of, venus, furthermore, probes, like, galileo, 1990, cassini, huygens, 1998, 1999, and, messenger, 2006, 2007, visited, venus, with, flybys, en, route, to, other, destinations, in, april, 2006, venus, express, the, first, dedicated, venus, mission, by, the, european, space, agency, esa, entered, orbit, around, venus, venus, express, provided, unprecedented, observation, of, venus, s, atmosphere, esa, concluded, the, venus, express, mission, in, december, 2014, deorbiting, it, in, january, 2015, in, 2010, the, first, successful, interplanetary, solar, sail, spacecraft, ikaros, travelled, to, venus, for, a, flyby, as, of, 2023, the, only, active, mission, at, venus, is, japan, s, akatsuki, having, achieved, orbital, insertion, on, 7, december, 2015, additionally, several, flybys, by, other, probes, have, been, performed, and, studied, venus, on, their, way, including, nasa, s, parker, solar, probe, and, esa, s, solar, orbiter, and, bepicolombo, there, are, currently, several, probes, under, development, as, well, as, multiple, proposed, missions, still, in, their, early, conceptual, stages, venus, has, been, identified, for, future, research, as, an, important, case, for, understanding, speculation, on, the, possibility, of, life, on, venus, s, surface, decreased, significantly, after, the, early, 1960s, when, it, became, clear, that, conditions, were, extreme, compared, to, those, on, earth, venus, s, extreme, temperatures, and, atmospheric, pressure, make, water, based, life, as, currently, known, unlikely, some, scientists, have, speculated, that, thermoacidophilic, extremophile, microorganisms, might, exist, in, the, cooler, acidic, upper, layers, of, the, venusian, atmosphere, such, speculations, go, back, to, 1967, when, carl, sagan, and, harold, j, morowitz, suggested, in, a, nature, article, that, tiny, objects, detected, in, venus, s, clouds, might, be, organisms, similar, to, earth, s, bacteria, which, are, of, approximately, the, same, size, in, august, 2019, astronomers, led, by, yeon, joo, lee, reported, that, long, term, pattern, of, absorbance, and, albedo, changes, in, the, atmosphere, of, the, planet, venus, caused, by, unknown, absorbers, which, may, be, chemicals, or, even, large, colonies, of, microorganisms, high, up, in, the, atmosphere, of, the, planet, affect, the, climate, their, light, absorbance, is, almost, identical, to, that, of, micro, organisms, in, earth, s, clouds, similar, conclusions, have, been, reached, by, other, studies, in, september, 2020, a, team, of, astronomers, led, by, jane, greaves, from, cardiff, university, announced, the, likely, detection, of, phosphine, a, gas, not, known, to, be, produced, by, any, known, chemical, processes, on, the, venusian, surface, or, atmosphere, in, the, upper, levels, of, the, planet, s, clouds, one, proposed, source, for, this, phosphine, is, living, organisms, the, phosphine, was, detected, at, heights, of, at, least, 30, miles, 48, km, above, the, surface, and, primarily, at, mid, latitudes, with, none, detected, at, the, poles, the, discovery, prompted, nasa, administrator, jim, bridenstine, to, publicly, call, for, a, new, focus, on, the, study, of, venus, describing, the, phosphine, find, as, the, most, significant, development, yet, in, building, the, case, for, life, off, earth, subsequent, analysis, of, the, data, processing, used, to, identify, phosphine, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, has, raised, concerns, that, the, detection, line, may, be, an, artefact, the, use, of, a, 12th, order, polynomial, fit, may, have, amplified, noise, and, generated, a, false, reading, see, runge, s, phenomenon, observations, of, the, atmosphere, of, venus, at, other, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, in, which, a, phosphine, absorption, line, would, be, expected, did, not, detect, phosphine, by, late, october, 2020, re, analysis, of, data, with, a, proper, subtraction, of, background, did, not, show, a, statistically, significant, detection, of, phosphine, members, of, the, team, around, greaves, are, working, as, part, of, a, project, by, the, mit, to, send, with, the, rocket, company, rocket, lab, the, first, private, interplanetary, space, craft, to, look, for, organics, by, entering, the, atmosphere, of, venus, with, a, probe, set, to, launch, in, january, 2025, the, committee, on, space, research, is, a, scientific, organization, established, by, the, international, council, for, science, among, their, responsibilities, is, the, development, of, recommendations, for, avoiding, interplanetary, contamination, for, this, purpose, space, missions, are, categorized, into, five, groups, due, to, the, harsh, surface, environment, of, venus, venus, has, been, under, the, planetary, protection, category, two, this, indicates, that, there, is, only, a, remote, chance, that, spacecraft, borne, contamination, could, compromise, investigations, venus, is, the, place, of, the, first, interplanetary, human, presence, mediated, through, robotic, missions, with, the, first, successful, landings, on, another, planet, and, extraterrestrial, body, other, than, the, moon, currently, in, orbit, is, akatsuki, and, other, probes, routinely, use, venus, for, gravity, assist, manoeuvres, capturing, some, data, about, venus, on, the, way, the, only, nation, that, has, sent, lander, probes, to, the, surface, of, venus, has, been, the, soviet, union, which, has, been, used, by, russian, officials, to, call, venus, a, russian, planet, studies, of, routes, for, crewed, missions, to, mars, have, since, the, 1960s, proposed, opposition, missions, instead, of, direct, conjunction, missions, with, venus, gravity, assist, flybys, demonstrating, that, they, should, be, quicker, and, safer, missions, to, mars, with, better, return, or, abort, flight, windows, and, less, or, the, same, amount, of, radiation, exposure, from, the, flight, as, direct, mars, flights, early, in, the, space, age, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, proposed, the, tmk, mavr, and, manned, venus, flyby, crewed, flyby, missions, to, venus, though, they, were, never, realized, while, the, surface, conditions, of, venus, are, inhospitable, the, atmospheric, pressure, temperature, and, solar, and, cosmic, radiation, 50, km, above, the, surface, are, similar, to, those, at, earth, s, surface, with, this, in, mind, soviet, engineer, sergey, zhitomirskiy, 1929, 2004, in, 1971, and, nasa, aerospace, engineer, geoffrey, a, landis, in, 2003, suggested, the, use, of, aerostats, for, crewed, exploration, and, possibly, for, permanent, floating, cities, in, the, venusian, atmosphere, an, alternative, to, the, popular, idea, of, living, on, planetary, surfaces, such, as, mars, among, the, many, engineering, challenges, for, any, human, presence, in, the, atmosphere, of, venus, are, the, corrosive, amounts, of, sulfuric, acid, in, the, atmosphere, nasa, s, high, altitude, venus, operational, concept, is, a, mission, concept, that, proposed, a, crewed, aerostat, design, venus, is, a, primary, feature, of, the, night, sky, and, so, has, been, of, remarkable, importance, in, mythology, astrology, and, fiction, throughout, history, and, in, different, cultures, the, english, name, of, venus, was, originally, the, ancient, roman, name, for, it, romans, named, venus, after, their, goddess, of, love, who, in, turn, was, based, on, the, ancient, greek, goddess, of, love, aphrodite, who, was, herself, based, on, the, similar, sumerian, religion, goddess, inanna, which, is, ishtar, in, akkadian, religion, all, of, whom, were, associated, with, the, planet, the, weekday, of, the, planet, and, these, goddesses, is, friday, named, after, the, germanic, goddess, frigg, who, has, been, associated, with, the, roman, goddess, venus, several, hymns, praise, inanna, in, her, role, as, the, goddess, of, the, planet, venus, theology, professor, jeffrey, cooley, has, argued, that, in, many, myths, inanna, s, movements, may, correspond, with, the, movements, of, the, planet, venus, in, the, sky, the, discontinuous, movements, of, venus, relate, to, both, mythology, as, well, as, inanna, s, dual, nature, in, inanna, s, descent, to, the, underworld, unlike, any, other, deity, inanna, is, able, to, descend, into, the, netherworld, and, return, to, the, heavens, the, planet, venus, appears, to, make, a, similar, descent, setting, in, the, west, and, then, rising, again, in, the, east, an, introductory, hymn, describes, inanna, leaving, the, heavens, and, heading, for, kur, what, could, be, presumed, to, be, the, mountains, replicating, the, rising, and, setting, of, inanna, to, the, west, in, inanna, and, shukaletuda, and, inanna, s, descent, into, the, underworld, appear, to, parallel, the, motion, of, the, planet, venus, in, inanna, and, shukaletuda, shukaletuda, is, described, as, scanning, the, heavens, in, search, of, inanna, possibly, searching, the, eastern, and, western, horizons, in, the, same, myth, while, searching, for, her, attacker, inanna, herself, makes, several, movements, that, correspond, with, the, movements, of, venus, in, the, sky, the, ancient, egyptians, and, ancient, greeks, possibly, knew, by, the, second, millennium, bc, or, at, the, latest, by, the, late, period, under, mesopotamian, influence, that, the, morning, star, and, an, evening, star, were, one, and, the, same, the, egyptians, knew, the, morning, star, as, tioumoutiri, and, the, evening, star, as, ouaiti, they, depicted, venus, at, first, as, a, phoenix, or, heron, see, bennu, calling, it, the, crosser, or, star, with, crosses, associating, it, with, osiris, and, later, depicting, it, two, headed, with, human, or, falco, heads, and, associated, it, with, horus, son, of, isis, which, during, the, even, later, hellenistic, period, was, together, with, hathor, identified, with, aphrodite, the, greeks, used, the, names, ph, sphoros, meaning, light, bringer, whence, the, element, phosphorus, alternately, sphoros, meaning, dawn, bringer, for, the, morning, star, and, hesperos, meaning, western, one, for, the, evening, star, both, children, of, dawn, eos, and, therefore, grandchildren, of, aphrodite, though, by, the, roman, era, they, were, recognized, as, one, celestial, object, known, as, the, star, of, venus, the, traditional, two, greek, names, continued, to, be, used, though, usually, translated, to, latin, as, l, cifer, and, vesper, classical, poets, such, as, homer, sappho, ovid, and, virgil, spoke, of, the, star, and, its, light, poets, such, as, william, blake, robert, frost, letitia, elizabeth, landon, alfred, lord, tennyson, and, william, wordsworth, wrote, odes, to, it, in, india, shukra, graha, the, planet, shukra, is, named, after, the, powerful, saint, shukra, shukra, which, is, used, in, indian, vedic, astrology, means, clear, pure, or, brightness, clearness, in, sanskrit, one, of, the, nine, navagraha, it, is, held, to, affect, wealth, pleasure, and, reproduction, it, was, the, son, of, bhrgu, preceptor, of, the, daityas, and, guru, of, the, asuras, the, word, shukra, is, also, associated, with, semen, or, generation, venus, is, known, as, kejora, in, indonesian, and, malaysian, malay, in, chinese, the, planet, is, called, j, n, x, ng, the, golden, planet, of, the, metal, element, modern, chinese, japanese, korean, and, vietnamese, cultures, refer, to, the, planet, literally, as, the, metal, star, based, on, the, five, elements, the, maya, considered, venus, to, be, the, most, important, celestial, body, after, the, sun, and, moon, they, called, it, chac, ek, or, noh, ek, the, great, star, the, cycles, of, venus, were, important, to, their, calendar, and, were, described, in, some, of, their, books, such, as, maya, codex, of, mexico, and, dresden, codex, the, estrella, solitaria, lone, star, flag, of, chile, depicts, venus, the, impenetrable, venusian, cloud, cover, gave, science, fiction, writers, free, rein, to, speculate, on, conditions, at, its, surface, all, the, more, so, when, early, observations, showed, that, not, only, was, it, similar, in, size, to, earth, it, possessed, a, substantial, atmosphere, closer, to, the, sun, than, earth, the, planet, was, often, depicted, as, warmer, but, still, habitable, by, humans, the, genre, reached, its, peak, between, the, 1930s, and, 1950s, at, a, time, when, science, had, revealed, some, aspects, of, venus, but, not, yet, the, harsh, reality, of, its, surface, conditions, findings, from, the, first, missions, to, venus, showed, reality, to, be, quite, different, and, brought, this, particular, genre, to, an, end, as, scientific, knowledge, of, venus, advanced, science, fiction, authors, tried, to, keep, pace, particularly, by, conjecturing, human, attempts, to, terraform, venus, the, symbol, of, a, circle, with, a, small, cross, beneath, is, the, so, called, venus, symbol, gaining, its, name, for, being, used, as, the, astronomical, symbol, for, venus, the, symbol, is, of, ancient, greek, origin, and, represents, more, generally, femininity, adopted, by, biology, as, gender, symbol, for, female, like, the, mars, symbol, for, male, and, sometimes, the, mercury, symbol, for, hermaphrodite, this, gendered, association, of, venus, and, mars, has, been, used, to, pair, them, heteronormatively, describing, women, and, men, stereotypically, as, being, so, different, that, they, can, be, understood, as, coming, from, different, planets, an, understanding, popularized, in, 1992, by, the, book, titled, men, are, from, mars, women, are, from, venus, the, venus, symbol, was, also, used, in, western, alchemy, representing, the, element, copper, like, the, symbol, of, mercury, is, also, the, symbol, of, the, element, mercury, and, since, polished, copper, has, been, used, for, mirrors, from, antiquity, the, symbol, for, venus, has, sometimes, been, called, venus, mirror, representing, the, mirror, of, the, goddess, although, this, origin, has, been, discredited, as, an, unlikely, origin, besides, the, venus, symbol, many, other, symbols, have, been, associated, with, venus, other, common, ones, are, the, crescent, or, particularly, the, star, as, with, the, star, of, ishtar, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo,
