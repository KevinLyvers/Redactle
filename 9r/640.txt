glacial, landforms, are, landforms, created, by, the, action, of, glaciers, most, of, today, s, glacial, landforms, were, created, by, the, movement, of, large, ice, sheets, during, the, quaternary, glaciations, some, areas, like, fennoscandia, and, the, southern, andes, have, extensive, occurrences, of, glacial, landforms, other, areas, such, as, the, sahara, display, rare, and, very, old, fossil, glacial, landforms, as, the, glaciers, expand, due, to, their, accumulating, weight, of, snow, and, ice, they, crush, abrade, and, scour, surfaces, such, as, rocks, and, bedrock, the, resulting, erosional, landforms, include, striations, cirques, glacial, horns, ar, tes, trim, lines, u, shaped, valleys, roches, moutonn, es, overdeepenings, and, hanging, valleys, later, when, the, glaciers, retreated, leaving, behind, their, freight, of, crushed, rock, and, sand, glacial, drift, they, created, characteristic, depositional, landforms, depositional, landforms, are, often, made, of, glacial, till, which, is, composed, of, unsorted, sediments, some, quite, large, others, small, that, were, eroded, carried, and, deposited, by, the, glacier, some, distance, away, from, their, original, rock, source, examples, include, glacial, moraines, eskers, and, kames, drumlins, and, ribbed, moraines, are, also, landforms, left, behind, by, retreating, glaciers, many, depositional, landforms, result, from, sediment, deposited, or, reshaped, by, meltwater, and, are, referred, to, as, fluvioglacial, landforms, fluvioglacial, deposits, differ, from, glacial, till, in, that, they, were, deposited, by, means, of, water, rather, than, the, glacial, itself, and, the, sediments, are, thus, also, more, size, sorted, than, glacial, till, is, the, stone, walls, of, new, england, contain, many, glacial, erratics, rocks, that, were, dragged, by, a, glacier, many, miles, from, their, bedrock, origin, lakes, and, ponds, may, also, be, caused, by, glacial, movement, kettle, lakes, form, when, a, retreating, glacier, leaves, behind, an, underground, or, surface, chunk, of, ice, that, later, melts, to, form, a, depression, containing, water, moraine, dammed, lakes, occur, when, glacial, debris, dam, a, stream, or, snow, runoff, jackson, lake, and, jenny, lake, in, grand, teton, national, park, are, examples, of, moraine, dammed, lakes, though, jackson, lake, is, enhanced, by, a, man, made, dam, apart, from, the, landforms, left, behind, by, glaciers, glaciers, themselves, are, striking, features, of, the, terrain, particularly, in, the, polar, regions, of, earth, notable, examples, include, valley, glaciers, where, glacial, flow, is, restricted, by, the, valley, walls, crevasses, in, the, upper, section, of, glacial, ice, and, icefalls, the, ice, equivalent, of, waterfalls, the, glacial, origin, of, some, landforms, has, been, questioned, erling, lindstr, m, has, advanced, the, thesis, that, roches, moutonn, es, may, not, be, entirely, glacial, landforms, and, may, have, already, had, most, of, their, shape, before, glaciation, jointing, that, contributes, to, their, shape, typically, predates, glaciation, and, roche, moutonn, e, like, forms, can, be, found, in, tropical, areas, such, as, east, africa, and, australia, further, at, iv, lake, in, sweden, rock, surfaces, exposed, by, kaolin, mining, and, then, weathered, resemble, roche, moutonn, e, the, idea, of, elevated, flat, surfaces, being, shaped, by, glaciation, the, glacial, buzzsaw, effect, has, been, rejected, by, various, scholars, in, the, case, of, norway, the, elevated, paleic, surface, has, been, proposed, to, have, been, shaped, by, the, glacial, buzzsaw, effect, however, this, proposal, is, difficult, to, reconcile, with, the, fact, that, the, paleic, surfaces, consist, of, a, series, of, steps, at, different, levels, glacial, cirques, that, in, the, buzzsaw, hypothesis, contribute, to, leveling, the, landscape, are, not, associated, with, any, paleosurface, levels, of, the, composite, paleic, surface, nor, does, the, modern, equilibrium, line, altitude, ela, or, the, last, glacial, maximum, ela, match, any, given, level, of, the, paleic, surface, the, elevated, plains, of, west, greenland, are, also, unrelated, to, any, glacial, buzzsaw, effect, the, gulf, of, bothnia, and, hudson, bay, two, large, depressions, at, the, centre, of, former, ice, sheets, are, known, to, be, more, the, result, of, tectonics, than, of, any, weak, glacial, erosion
