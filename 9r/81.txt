an, astronomical, object, celestial, object, stellar, object, or, heavenly, body, is, a, naturally, occurring, physical, entity, association, or, structure, that, exists, within, the, observable, universe, in, astronomy, the, terms, object, and, body, are, often, used, interchangeably, however, an, astronomical, body, or, celestial, body, is, a, single, tightly, bound, contiguous, entity, while, an, astronomical, or, celestial, object, is, a, complex, less, cohesively, bound, structure, which, may, consist, of, multiple, bodies, or, even, other, objects, with, substructures, examples, of, astronomical, objects, include, planetary, systems, star, clusters, nebulae, and, galaxies, while, asteroids, moons, planets, and, stars, are, astronomical, bodies, a, comet, may, be, identified, as, both, a, body, and, an, object, it, is, a, body, when, referring, to, the, frozen, nucleus, of, ice, and, dust, and, an, object, when, describing, the, entire, comet, with, its, diffuse, coma, and, tail, astronomical, objects, such, as, stars, planets, nebulae, asteroids, and, comets, have, been, observed, for, thousands, of, years, although, early, cultures, thought, of, these, bodies, as, gods, or, deities, these, early, cultures, found, the, movements, of, the, bodies, very, important, as, they, used, these, objects, to, help, navigate, over, long, distances, tell, between, the, seasons, and, to, determine, when, to, plant, crops, during, the, middle, ages, cultures, began, to, study, the, movements, of, these, bodies, more, closely, several, astronomers, of, the, middle, east, began, to, make, detailed, descriptions, of, stars, and, nebulae, and, would, make, more, accurate, calendars, based, on, the, movements, of, these, stars, and, planets, in, europe, astronomers, focused, more, on, devices, to, help, study, the, celestial, objects, and, creating, textbooks, guides, and, universities, to, teach, people, more, about, astronomy, during, the, scientific, revolution, in, 1543, nicolaus, copernicus, s, heliocentric, model, was, published, this, model, described, the, earth, along, with, all, of, the, other, planets, as, being, astronomical, bodies, which, orbited, the, sun, located, in, the, center, of, the, solar, system, johannes, kepler, discovered, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, which, are, properties, of, the, orbits, that, the, astronomical, bodies, shared, this, was, used, to, improve, the, heliocentric, model, in, 1584, giordano, bruno, proposed, that, all, distant, stars, are, their, own, suns, being, the, first, in, centuries, to, suggest, this, idea, galileo, galilei, was, one, of, the, first, astronomers, to, use, telescopes, to, observe, the, sky, in, 1610, he, observed, the, four, largest, moons, of, jupiter, now, named, the, galilean, moons, galileo, also, made, observations, of, the, phases, of, venus, craters, on, the, moon, and, sunspots, on, the, sun, astronomer, edmond, halley, was, able, to, successfully, predict, the, return, of, halley, s, comet, which, now, bears, his, name, in, 1758, in, 1781, sir, william, herschel, discovered, the, new, planet, uranus, being, the, first, discovered, planet, not, visible, by, the, naked, eye, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, new, technologies, and, scientific, innovations, allowed, scientists, to, greatly, expand, their, understanding, of, astronomy, and, astronomical, objects, larger, telescopes, and, observatories, began, to, be, built, and, scientists, began, to, print, images, of, the, moon, and, other, celestial, bodies, on, photographic, plates, new, wavelengths, of, light, unseen, by, the, human, eye, were, discovered, and, new, telescopes, were, made, that, made, it, possible, to, see, astronomical, objects, in, other, wavelengths, of, light, joseph, von, fraunhofer, and, angelo, secchi, pioneered, the, field, of, spectroscopy, which, allowed, them, to, observe, the, composition, of, stars, and, nebulae, and, many, astronomers, were, able, to, determine, the, masses, of, binary, stars, based, on, their, orbital, elements, computers, began, to, be, used, to, observe, and, study, massive, amounts, of, astronomical, data, on, stars, and, new, technologies, such, as, the, photoelectric, photometer, allowed, astronomers, to, accurately, measure, the, color, and, luminosity, of, stars, which, allowed, them, to, predict, their, temperature, and, mass, in, 1913, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, was, developed, by, astronomers, ejnar, hertzsprung, and, henry, norris, russell, independently, of, each, other, which, plotted, stars, based, on, their, luminosity, and, color, and, allowed, astronomers, to, easily, examine, stars, it, was, found, that, stars, commonly, fell, on, a, band, of, stars, called, the, main, sequence, stars, on, the, diagram, a, refined, scheme, for, stellar, classification, was, published, in, 1943, by, william, wilson, morgan, and, philip, childs, keenan, based, on, the, hertzsprung, russel, diagram, astronomers, also, began, debating, whether, other, galaxies, existed, beyond, the, milky, way, these, debates, ended, when, edwin, hubble, identified, the, andromeda, nebula, as, a, different, galaxy, along, with, many, others, far, from, the, milky, way, the, universe, can, be, viewed, as, having, a, hierarchical, structure, at, the, largest, scales, the, fundamental, component, of, assembly, is, the, galaxy, galaxies, are, organized, into, groups, and, clusters, often, within, larger, superclusters, that, are, strung, along, great, filaments, between, nearly, empty, voids, forming, a, web, that, spans, the, observable, universe, galaxies, have, a, variety, of, morphologies, with, irregular, elliptical, and, disk, like, shapes, depending, on, their, formation, and, evolutionary, histories, including, interaction, with, other, galaxies, which, may, lead, to, a, merger, disc, galaxies, encompass, lenticular, and, spiral, galaxies, with, features, such, as, spiral, arms, and, a, distinct, halo, at, the, core, most, galaxies, have, a, supermassive, black, hole, which, may, result, in, an, active, galactic, nucleus, galaxies, can, also, have, satellites, in, the, form, of, dwarf, galaxies, and, globular, clusters, the, constituents, of, a, galaxy, are, formed, out, of, gaseous, matter, that, assembles, through, gravitational, self, attraction, in, a, hierarchical, manner, at, this, level, the, resulting, fundamental, components, are, the, stars, which, are, typically, assembled, in, clusters, from, the, various, condensing, nebulae, the, great, variety, of, stellar, forms, are, determined, almost, entirely, by, the, mass, composition, and, evolutionary, state, of, these, stars, stars, may, be, found, in, multi, star, systems, that, orbit, about, each, other, in, a, hierarchical, organization, a, planetary, system, and, various, minor, objects, such, as, asteroids, comets, and, debris, can, form, in, a, hierarchical, process, of, accretion, from, the, protoplanetary, disks, that, surround, newly, formed, stars, the, various, distinctive, types, of, stars, are, shown, by, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, h, r, diagram, a, plot, of, absolute, stellar, luminosity, versus, surface, temperature, each, star, follows, an, evolutionary, track, across, this, diagram, if, this, track, takes, the, star, through, a, region, containing, an, intrinsic, variable, type, then, its, physical, properties, can, cause, it, to, become, a, variable, star, an, example, of, this, is, the, instability, strip, a, region, of, the, h, r, diagram, that, includes, delta, scuti, rr, lyrae, and, cepheid, variables, the, evolving, star, may, eject, some, portion, of, its, atmosphere, to, form, a, nebula, either, steadily, to, form, a, planetary, nebula, or, in, a, supernova, explosion, that, leaves, a, remnant, depending, on, the, initial, mass, of, the, star, and, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, companion, a, star, may, spend, the, last, part, of, its, life, as, a, compact, object, either, a, white, dwarf, neutron, star, or, black, hole, the, iau, definitions, of, planet, and, dwarf, planet, require, that, a, sun, orbiting, astronomical, body, has, undergone, the, rounding, process, to, reach, a, roughly, spherical, shape, an, achievement, known, as, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, same, spheroidal, shape, can, be, seen, on, smaller, rocky, planets, like, mars, to, gas, giants, like, jupiter, any, natural, sun, orbiting, body, that, has, not, reached, hydrostatic, equilibrium, is, classified, by, the, iau, as, a, small, solar, system, body, sssb, these, come, in, many, non, spherical, shapes, which, are, lumpy, masses, accreted, haphazardly, by, in, falling, dust, and, rock, not, enough, mass, falls, in, to, generate, the, heat, needed, to, complete, the, rounding, some, sssbs, are, just, collections, of, relatively, small, rocks, that, are, weakly, held, next, to, each, other, by, gravity, but, are, not, actually, fused, into, a, single, big, bedrock, some, larger, sssbs, are, nearly, round, but, have, not, reached, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, small, solar, system, body, 4, vesta, is, large, enough, to, have, undergone, at, least, partial, planetary, differentiation, stars, like, the, sun, are, also, spheroidal, due, to, gravity, s, effects, on, their, plasma, which, is, a, free, flowing, fluid, ongoing, stellar, fusion, is, a, much, greater, source, of, heat, for, stars, compared, to, the, initial, heat, released, during, their, formation, the,
