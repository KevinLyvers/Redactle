a, wildfire, forest, fire, or, a, bushfire, is, an, unplanned, uncontrolled, and, unpredictable, fire, in, an, area, of, combustible, vegetation, depending, on, the, type, of, vegetation, present, a, wildfire, may, be, more, specifically, identified, as, a, bushfire, in, australia, desert, fire, grass, fire, hill, fire, peat, fire, prairie, fire, vegetation, fire, or, veld, fire, some, natural, forest, ecosystems, depend, on, wildfire, wildfires, are, different, from, controlled, or, prescribed, burning, which, are, carried, out, to, provide, a, benefit, for, people, modern, forest, management, often, engages, in, prescribed, burns, to, mitigate, fire, risk, and, promote, natural, forest, cycles, however, controlled, burns, can, turn, into, wildfires, by, mistake, wildfires, can, be, classified, by, cause, of, ignition, physical, properties, combustible, material, present, and, the, effect, of, weather, on, the, fire, wildfire, severity, results, from, a, combination, of, factors, such, as, available, fuels, physical, setting, and, weather, climatic, cycles, with, wet, periods, that, create, substantial, fuels, followed, by, drought, and, heat, often, precede, severe, wildfires, these, cycles, have, been, intensified, by, climate, change, 247, wildfires, are, a, common, type, of, disaster, in, some, regions, including, siberia, russia, california, united, states, british, columbia, canada, and, australia, areas, with, mediterranean, climates, or, in, the, taiga, biome, are, particularly, susceptible, wildfires, can, severely, impact, humans, and, their, settlements, effects, include, for, example, the, direct, health, impacts, of, smoke, and, fire, as, well, as, destruction, of, property, especially, in, wildland, urban, interfaces, and, economic, losses, there, is, also, the, potential, for, contamination, of, water, and, soil, at, a, global, level, human, practices, have, made, the, impacts, of, wildfire, worse, with, a, doubling, in, land, area, burned, by, wildfires, compared, to, natural, levels, 247, humans, have, impacted, wildfire, through, climate, change, e, g, more, intense, heat, waves, and, droughts, land, use, change, and, wildfire, suppression, 247, the, carbon, released, from, wildfires, can, add, to, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere, and, thus, contribute, to, the, greenhouse, effect, this, creates, a, climate, change, feedback, 20, naturally, occurring, wildfires, can, have, beneficial, effects, on, those, ecosystems, that, have, evolved, with, fire, in, fact, many, plant, species, depend, on, the, effects, of, fire, for, growth, and, reproduction, the, ignition, of, a, fire, takes, place, through, either, natural, causes, or, human, activity, deliberate, or, not, natural, occurrences, that, can, ignite, wildfires, without, the, involvement, of, humans, include, lightning, volcanic, eruptions, sparks, from, rock, falls, and, spontaneous, combustions, sources, of, human, caused, fire, may, include, arson, accidental, ignition, or, the, uncontrolled, use, of, fire, in, land, clearing, and, agriculture, such, as, the, slash, and, burn, farming, in, southeast, asia, in, the, tropics, farmers, often, practice, the, slash, and, burn, method, of, clearing, fields, during, the, dry, season, in, middle, latitudes, the, most, common, human, causes, of, wildfires, are, equipment, generating, sparks, chainsaws, grinders, mowers, etc, overhead, power, lines, and, arson, arson, may, account, for, over, 20, of, human, caused, fires, however, in, the, 2019, 20, australian, bushfire, season, an, independent, study, found, online, bots, and, trolls, exaggerating, the, role, of, arson, in, the, fires, in, the, 2023, canadian, wildfires, false, claims, of, arson, gained, traction, on, social, media, however, arson, is, generally, not, a, main, cause, of, wildfires, in, canada, in, california, generally, 6, 10, of, wildfires, annually, are, arson, coal, seam, fires, burn, in, the, thousands, around, the, world, such, as, those, in, burning, mountain, new, south, wales, centralia, pennsylvania, and, several, coal, sustained, fires, in, china, they, can, also, flare, up, unexpectedly, and, ignite, nearby, flammable, material, the, spread, of, wildfires, varies, based, on, the, flammable, material, present, its, vertical, arrangement, and, moisture, content, and, weather, conditions, fuel, arrangement, and, density, is, governed, in, part, by, topography, as, land, shape, determines, factors, such, as, available, sunlight, and, water, for, plant, growth, overall, fire, types, can, be, generally, characterized, by, their, fuels, as, follows, wildfires, occur, when, all, the, necessary, elements, of, a, fire, triangle, come, together, in, a, susceptible, area, an, ignition, source, is, brought, into, contact, with, a, combustible, material, such, as, vegetation, that, is, subjected, to, enough, heat, and, has, an, adequate, supply, of, oxygen, from, the, ambient, air, a, high, moisture, content, usually, prevents, ignition, and, slows, propagation, because, higher, temperatures, are, needed, to, evaporate, any, water, in, the, material, and, heat, the, material, to, its, fire, point, dense, forests, usually, provide, more, shade, resulting, in, lower, ambient, temperatures, and, greater, humidity, and, are, therefore, less, susceptible, to, wildfires, less, dense, material, such, as, grasses, and, leaves, are, easier, to, ignite, because, they, contain, less, water, than, denser, material, such, as, branches, and, trunks, plants, continuously, lose, water, by, evapotranspiration, but, water, loss, is, usually, balanced, by, water, absorbed, from, the, soil, humidity, or, rain, when, this, balance, is, not, maintained, often, as, a, consequence, of, droughts, plants, dry, out, and, are, therefore, more, flammable, a, wildfire, front, is, the, portion, sustaining, continuous, flaming, combustion, where, unburned, material, meets, active, flames, or, the, smoldering, transition, between, unburned, and, burned, material, as, the, front, approaches, the, fire, heats, both, the, surrounding, air, and, woody, material, through, convection, and, thermal, radiation, first, wood, is, dried, as, water, is, vaporized, at, a, temperature, of, 100, c, 212, f, next, the, pyrolysis, of, wood, at, 230, c, 450, f, releases, flammable, gases, finally, wood, can, smolder, at, 380, c, 720, f, or, when, heated, sufficiently, ignite, at, 590, c, 1, 000, f, even, before, the, flames, of, a, wildfire, arrive, at, a, particular, location, heat, transfer, from, the, wildfire, front, warms, the, air, to, 800, c, 1, 470, f, which, pre, heats, and, dries, flammable, materials, causing, materials, to, ignite, faster, and, allowing, the, fire, to, spread, faster, high, temperature, and, long, duration, surface, wildfires, may, encourage, flashover, or, torching, the, drying, of, tree, canopies, and, their, subsequent, ignition, from, below, wildfires, have, a, rapid, forward, rate, of, spread, fros, when, burning, through, dense, uninterrupted, fuels, they, can, move, as, fast, as, 10, 8, kilometres, per, hour, 6, 7, mph, in, forests, and, 22, kilometres, per, hour, 14, mph, in, grasslands, wildfires, can, advance, tangential, to, the, main, front, to, form, a, flanking, front, or, burn, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, main, front, by, backing, they, may, also, spread, by, jumping, or, spotting, as, winds, and, vertical, convection, columns, carry, firebrands, hot, wood, embers, and, other, burning, materials, through, the, air, over, roads, rivers, and, other, barriers, that, may, otherwise, act, as, firebreaks, torching, and, fires, in, tree, canopies, encourage, spotting, and, dry, ground, fuels, around, a, wildfire, are, especially, vulnerable, to, ignition, from, firebrands, spotting, can, create, spot, fires, as, hot, embers, and, firebrands, ignite, fuels, downwind, from, the, fire, in, australian, bushfires, spot, fires, are, known, to, occur, as, far, as, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, from, the, fire, front, especially, large, wildfires, may, affect, air, currents, in, their, immediate, vicinities, by, the, stack, effect, air, rises, as, it, is, heated, and, large, wildfires, create, powerful, updrafts, that, will, draw, in, new, cooler, air, from, surrounding, areas, in, thermal, columns, great, vertical, differences, in, temperature, and, humidity, encourage, pyrocumulus, clouds, strong, winds, and, fire, whirls, with, the, force, of, tornadoes, at, speeds, of, more, than, 80, kilometres, per, hour, 50, mph, rapid, rates, of, spread, prolific, crowning, or, spotting, the, presence, of, fire, whirls, and, strong, convection, columns, signify, extreme, conditions, intensity, also, increases, during, daytime, hours, burn, rates, of, smoldering, logs, are, up, to, five, times, greater, during, the, day, due, to, lower, humidity, increased, temperatures, and, increased, wind, speeds, sunlight, warms, the, ground, during, the, day, which, creates, air, currents, that, travel, uphill, at, night, the, land, cools, creating, air, currents, that, travel, downhill, wildfires, are, fanned, by, these, winds, and, often, follow, the, air, currents, over, hills, and, through, valleys, fires, in, europe, occur, frequently, during, the, hours, of, 12, 00, p, m, and, 2, 00, p, m, wildfire, suppression, operations, in, the, united, states, revolve, around, a, 24, hour, fire, day, that, begins, at, 10, 00, a, m, due, to, the, predictable, increase, in, intensity, resulting, from, the, daytime, warmth, climate, change, promotes, the, type, of, weather, that, makes, wildfires, more, likely, in, some, areas, an, increase, of, wildfires, has, been, attributed, directly, to, climate, change, 247, evidence, from, earth, s, past, also, shows, more, fire, in, warmer, periods, climate, change, increases, evapotranspiration, this, can, cause, vegetation, and, soils, to, dry, out, when, a, fire, starts, in, an, area, with, very, dry, vegetation, it, can, spread, rapidly, higher, temperatures, can, also, lengthen, the, fire, season, this, is, the, time, of, year, in, which, severe, wildfires, are, most, likely, particularly, in, regions, where, snow, is, disappearing, weather, conditions, are, raising, the, risks, of, wildfires, but, the, total, area, burnt, by, wildfires, has, decreased, this, is, mostly, because, savanna, has, been, converted, to, cropland, so, there, are, fewer, trees, to, burn, climate, variability, including, heat, waves, droughts, and, el, ni, o, and, regional, weather, patterns, such, as, high, pressure, ridges, can, increase, the, risk, and, alter, the, behavior, of, wildfires, dramatically, years, of, high, precipitation, can, produce, rapid, vegetation, growth, which, when, followed, by, warmer, periods, can, encourage, more, widespread, fires, and, longer, fire, seasons, high, temperatures, dry, out, the, fuel, loads, and, make, them, more, flammable, increasing, tree, mortality, and, posing, significant, risks, to, global, forest, health, since, the, mid, 1980s, in, the, western, us, earlier, snowmelt, and, associated, warming, has, also, been, associated, with, an, increase, in, length, and, severity, of, the, wildfire, season, or, the, most, fire, prone, time, of, the, year, a, 2019, study, indicates, that, the, increase, in, fire, risk, in, california, may, be, partially, attributable, to, human, induced, climate, change, in, the, summer, of, 1974, 1975, southern, hemisphere, australia, suffered, its, worst, recorded, wildfire, when, 15, of, australia, s, land, mass, suffered, extensive, fire, damage, fires, that, summer, burned, up, an, estimated, 117, million, hectares, 290, million, acres, 1, 170, 000, square, kilometres, 450, 000, square, miles, in, australia, the, annual, number, of, hot, days, above, 35, c, and, very, hot, days, above, 40, c, has, increased, significantly, in, many, areas, of, the, country, since, 1950, the, country, has, always, had, bushfires, but, in, 2019, the, extent, and, ferocity, of, these, fires, increased, dramatically, for, the, first, time, catastrophic, bushfire, conditions, were, declared, for, greater, sydney, new, south, wales, and, queensland, declared, a, state, of, emergency, but, fires, were, also, burning, in, south, australia, and, western, australia, in, 2019, extreme, heat, and, dryness, caused, massive, wildfires, in, siberia, alaska, canary, islands, australia, and, in, the, amazon, rainforest, the, fires, in, the, latter, were, caused, mainly, by, illegal, logging, the, smoke, from, the, fires, expanded, on, huge, territory, including, major, cities, dramatically, reducing, air, quality, as, of, august, 2020, the, wildfires, in, that, year, were, 13, worse, than, in, 2019, due, primarily, to, climate, change, deforestation, and, agricultural, burning, the, amazon, rainforest, s, existence, is, threatened, by, fires, record, breaking, wildfires, in, 2021, occurred, in, turkey, greece, and, russia, thought, to, be, linked, to, climate, change, the, carbon, released, from, wildfires, can, add, to, greenhouse, gas, concentrations, climate, models, do, not, yet, fully, reflect, this, feedback, 20, wildfires, release, large, amounts, of, carbon, dioxide, black, and, brown, carbon, particles, and, ozone, precursors, such, as, volatile, organic, compounds, and, nitrogen, oxides, nox, into, the, atmosphere, these, emissions, affect, radiation, clouds, and, climate, on, regional, and, even, global, scales, wildfires, also, emit, substantial, amounts, of, semi, volatile, organic, species, that, can, partition, from, the, gas, phase, to, form, secondary, organic, aerosol, soa, over, hours, to, days, after, emission, in, addition, the, formation, of, the, other, pollutants, as, the, air, is, transported, can, lead, to, harmful, exposures, for, populations, in, regions, far, away, from, the, wildfires, while, direct, emissions, of, harmful, pollutants, can, affect, first, responders, and, residents, wildfire, smoke, can, also, be, transported, over, long, distances, and, impact, air, quality, across, local, regional, and, global, scales, the, health, effects, of, wildfire, smoke, such, as, worsening, cardiovascular, and, respiratory, conditions, extend, beyond, immediate, exposure, contributing, to, nearly, 16, 000, annual, deaths, a, number, expected, to, rise, to, 30, 000, by, 2050, the, economic, impact, is, also, significant, with, projected, costs, reaching, 240, billion, annually, by, 2050, surpassing, other, climate, related, damages, over, the, past, century, wildfires, have, accounted, for, 20, 25, of, global, carbon, emissions, the, remainder, from, human, activities, global, carbon, emissions, from, wildfires, through, august, 2020, equaled, the, average, annual, emissions, of, the, european, union, in, 2020, the, carbon, released, by, california, s, wildfires, was, significantly, larger, than, the, state, s, other, carbon, emissions, forest, fires, in, indonesia, in, 1997, were, estimated, to, have, released, between, 0, 81, and, 2, 57, giga, tonnes, 0, 89, and, 2, 83, billion, short, tons, of, co, 2, into, the, atmosphere, which, is, between, 13, 40, of, the, annual, global, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, burning, fossil, fuels, in, june, and, july, 2019, fires, in, the, arctic, emitted, more, than, 140, megatons, of, carbon, dioxide, according, to, an, analysis, by, cams, to, put, that, into, perspective, this, amounts, to, the, same, amount, of, carbon, emitted, by, 36, million, cars, in, a, year, the, recent, wildfires, and, their, massive, co, 2, emissions, mean, that, it, will, be, important, to, take, them, into, consideration, when, implementing, measures, for, reaching, greenhouse, gas, reduction, targets, accorded, with, the, paris, climate, agreement, due, to, the, complex, oxidative, chemistry, occurring, during, the, transport, of, wildfire, smoke, in, the, atmosphere, the, toxicity, of, emissions, was, indicated, to, increase, over, time, atmospheric, models, suggest, that, these, concentrations, of, sooty, particles, could, increase, absorption, of, incoming, solar, radiation, during, winter, months, by, as, much, as, 15, the, amazon, is, estimated, to, hold, around, 90, billion, tons, of, carbon, as, of, 2019, the, earth, s, atmosphere, has, 415, parts, per, million, of, carbon, and, the, destruction, of, the, amazon, would, add, about, 38, parts, per, million, some, research, has, shown, wildfire, smoke, can, have, a, cooling, effect, research, in, 2007, stated, that, black, carbon, in, snow, changed, temperature, three, times, more, than, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, as, much, as, 94, percent, of, arctic, warming, may, be, caused, by, dark, carbon, on, snow, that, initiates, melting, the, dark, carbon, comes, from, fossil, fuels, burning, wood, and, other, biofuels, and, forest, fires, melting, can, occur, even, at, low, concentrations, of, dark, carbon, below, five, parts, per, billion, wildfire, prevention, refers, to, the, preemptive, methods, aimed, at, reducing, the, risk, of, fires, as, well, as, lessening, its, severity, and, spread, prevention, techniques, aim, to, manage, air, quality, maintain, ecological, balances, protect, resources, and, to, affect, future, fires, prevention, policies, must, consider, the, role, that, humans, play, in, wildfires, since, for, example, 95, of, forest, fires, in, europe, are, related, to, human, involvement, wildfire, prevention, programs, around, the, world, may, employ, techniques, such, as, wildland, fire, use, wfu, and, prescribed, or, controlled, burns, wildland, fire, use, refers, to, any, fire, of, natural, causes, that, is, monitored, but, allowed, to, burn, controlled, burns, are, fires, ignited, by, government, agencies, under, less, dangerous, weather, conditions, other, objectives, can, include, maintenance, of, healthy, forests, rangelands, and, wetlands, and, support, of, ecosystem, diversity, strategies, for, wildfire, prevention, detection, control, and, suppression, have, varied, over, the, years, one, common, and, inexpensive, technique, to, reduce, the, risk, of, uncontrolled, wildfires, is, controlled, burning, intentionally, igniting, smaller, less, intense, fires, to, minimize, the, amount, of, flammable, material, available, for, a, potential, wildfire, vegetation, may, be, burned, periodically, to, limit, the, accumulation, of, plants, and, other, debris, that, may, serve, as, fuel, while, also, maintaining, high, species, diversity, while, other, people, claim, that, controlled, burns, and, a, policy, of, allowing, some, wildfires, to, burn, is, the, cheapest, method, and, an, ecologically, appropriate, policy, for, many, forests, they, tend, not, to, take, into, account, the, economic, value, of, resources, that, are, consumed, by, the, fire, especially, merchantable, timber, some, studies, conclude, that, while, fuels, may, also, be, removed, by, logging, such, thinning, treatments, may, not, be, effective, at, reducing, fire, severity, under, extreme, weather, conditions, building, codes, in, fire, prone, areas, typically, require, that, structures, be, built, of, flame, resistant, materials, and, a, defensible, space, be, maintained, by, clearing, flammable, materials, within, a, prescribed, distance, from, the, structure, communities, in, the, philippines, also, maintain, fire, lines, 5, to, 10, meters, 16, to, 33, ft, wide, between, the, forest, and, their, village, and, patrol, these, lines, during, summer, months, or, seasons, of, dry, weather, continued, residential, development, in, fire, prone, areas, and, rebuilding, structures, destroyed, by, fires, has, been, met, with, criticism, the, ecological, benefits, of, fire, are, often, overridden, by, the, economic, and, safety, benefits, of, protecting, structures, and, human, life, the, demand, for, timely, high, quality, fire, information, has, increased, in, recent, years, fast, and, effective, detection, is, a, key, factor, in, wildfire, fighting, early, detection, efforts, were, focused, on, early, response, accurate, results, in, both, daytime, and, nighttime, and, the, ability, to, prioritize, fire, danger, fire, lookout, towers, were, used, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, fires, were, reported, using, telephones, carrier, pigeons, and, heliographs, aerial, and, land, photography, using, instant, cameras, were, used, in, the, 1950s, until, infrared, scanning, was, developed, for, fire, detection, in, the, 1960s, however, information, analysis, and, delivery, was, often, delayed, by, limitations, in, communication, technology, early, satellite, derived, fire, analyses, were, hand, drawn, on, maps, at, a, remote, site, and, sent, via, overnight, mail, to, the, fire, manager, during, the, yellowstone, fires, of, 1988, a, data, station, was, established, in, west, yellowstone, permitting, the, delivery, of, satellite, based, fire, information, in, approximately, four, hours, public, hotlines, fire, lookouts, in, towers, and, ground, and, aerial, patrols, can, be, used, as, a, means, of, early, detection, of, forest, fires, however, accurate, human, observation, may, be, limited, by, operator, fatigue, time, of, day, time, of, year, and, geographic, location, electronic, systems, have, gained, popularity, in, recent, years, as, a, possible, resolution, to, human, operator, error, these, systems, may, be, semi, or, fully, automated, and, employ, systems, based, on, the, risk, area, and, degree, of, human, presence, as, suggested, by, gis, data, analyses, an, integrated, approach, of, multiple, systems, can, be, used, to, merge, satellite, data, aerial, imagery, and, personnel, position, via, global, positioning, system, gps, into, a, collective, whole, for, near, realtime, use, by, wireless, incident, command, centers, a, small, high, risk, area, that, features, thick, vegetation, a, strong, human, presence, or, is, close, to, a, critical, urban, area, can, be, monitored, using, a, local, sensor, network, detection, systems, may, include, wireless, sensor, networks, that, act, as, automated, weather, systems, detecting, temperature, humidity, and, smoke, these, may, be, battery, powered, solar, powered, or, tree, rechargeable, able, to, recharge, their, battery, systems, using, the, small, electrical, currents, in, plant, material, larger, medium, risk, areas, can, be, monitored, by, scanning, towers, that, incorporate, fixed, cameras, and, sensors, to, detect, smoke, or, additional, factors, such, as, the, infrared, signature, of, carbon, dioxide, produced, by, fires, additional, capabilities, such, as, night, vision, brightness, detection, and, color, change, detection, may, also, be, incorporated, into, sensor, arrays, the, department, of, natural, resources, signed, a, contract, with, panoai, for, the, installation, of, 360, degree, rapid, detection, cameras, around, the, pacific, northwest, which, are, mounted, on, cell, towers, and, are, capable, of, 24, 7, monitoring, of, a, 15, mile, radius, additionally, sensaio, tech, based, in, brazil, and, toronto, has, released, a, sensor, device, that, continuously, monitors, 14, different, variables, common, in, forests, ranging, from, soil, temperature, to, salinity, this, information, is, connected, live, back, to, clients, through, dashboard, visualizations, while, mobile, notifications, are, provided, regarding, dangerous, levels, satellite, and, aerial, monitoring, through, the, use, of, planes, helicopter, or, uavs, can, provide, a, wider, view, and, may, be, sufficient, to, monitor, very, large, low, risk, areas, these, more, sophisticated, systems, employ, gps, and, aircraft, mounted, infrared, or, high, resolution, visible, cameras, to, identify, and, target, wildfires, satellite, mounted, sensors, such, as, envisat, s, advanced, along, track, scanning, radiometer, and, european, remote, sensing, satellite, s, along, track, scanning, radiometer, can, measure, infrared, radiation, emitted, by, fires,

time, cloud, cover, and, image, resolution, may, also, limit, the, effectiveness, of, satellite, imagery, global, forest, watch, provides, detailed, daily, updates, on, fire, alerts, in, 2015, a, new, fire, detection, tool, is, in, operation, at, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, usda, forest, service, usfs, which, uses, data, from, the, suomi, national, polar, orbiting, partnership, npp, satellite, to, detect, smaller, fires, in, more, detail, than, previous, space, based, products, the, high, resolution, data, is, used, with, a, computer, model, to, predict, how, a, fire, will, change, direction, based, on, weather, and, land, conditions, in, 2014, an, international, campaign, was, organized, in, south, africa, s, kruger, national, park, to, validate, fire, detection, products, including, the, new, viirs, active, fire, data, in, advance, of, that, campaign, the, meraka, institute, of, the, council, for, scientific, and, industrial, research, in, pretoria, south, africa, an, early, adopter, of, the, viirs, 375, m, fire, product, put, it, to, use, during, several, large, wildfires, in, kruger, between, 2022, 2023, wildfires, throughout, north, america, prompted, an, uptake, in, the, delivery, and, design, of, various, technologies, using, artificial, intelligence, for, early, detection, prevention, and, prediction, of, wildfires, wildfire, suppression, depends, on, the, technologies, available, in, the, area, in, which, the, wildfire, occurs, in, less, developed, nations, the, techniques, used, can, be, as, simple, as, throwing, sand, or, beating, the, fire, with, sticks, or, palm, fronds, in, more, advanced, nations, the, suppression, methods, vary, due, to, increased, technological, capacity, silver, iodide, can, be, used, to, encourage, snow, fall, while, fire, retardants, and, water, can, be, dropped, onto, fires, by, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, planes, and, helicopters, complete, fire, suppression, is, no, longer, an, expectation, but, the, majority, of, wildfires, are, often, extinguished, before, they, grow, out, of, control, while, more, than, 99, of, the, 10, 000, new, wildfires, each, year, are, contained, escaped, wildfires, under, extreme, weather, conditions, are, difficult, to, suppress, without, a, change, in, the, weather, wildfires, in, canada, and, the, us, burn, an, average, of, 54, 500, square, kilometers, 13, 000, 000, acres, per, year, above, all, fighting, wildfires, can, become, deadly, a, wildfire, s, burning, front, may, also, change, direction, unexpectedly, and, jump, across, fire, breaks, intense, heat, and, smoke, can, lead, to, disorientation, and, loss, of, appreciation, of, the, direction, of, the, fire, which, can, make, fires, particularly, dangerous, for, example, during, the, 1949, mann, gulch, fire, in, montana, united, states, thirteen, smokejumpers, died, when, they, lost, their, communication, links, became, disoriented, and, were, overtaken, by, the, fire, in, the, australian, february, 2009, victorian, bushfires, at, least, 173, people, died, and, over, 2, 029, homes, and, 3, 500, structures, were, lost, when, they, became, engulfed, by, wildfire, the, suppression, of, wild, fires, takes, up, a, large, amount, of, a, country, s, gross, domestic, product, which, directly, affects, the, country, s, economy, while, costs, vary, wildly, from, year, to, year, depending, on, the, severity, of, each, fire, season, in, the, united, states, local, state, federal, and, tribal, agencies, collectively, spend, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, annually, to, suppress, wildfires, in, the, united, states, it, was, reported, that, approximately, 6, billion, was, spent, between, 2004, 2008, to, suppress, wildfires, in, the, country, in, california, the, u, s, forest, service, spends, about, 200, million, per, year, to, suppress, 98, of, wildfires, and, up, to, 1, billion, to, suppress, the, other, 2, of, fires, that, escape, initial, attack, and, become, large, wildland, fire, fighters, face, several, life, threatening, hazards, including, heat, stress, fatigue, smoke, and, dust, as, well, as, the, risk, of, other, injuries, such, as, burns, cuts, and, scrapes, animal, bites, and, even, rhabdomyolysis, between, 2000, and, 2016, more, than, 350, wildland, firefighters, died, on, duty, especially, in, hot, weather, conditions, fires, present, the, risk, of, heat, stress, which, can, entail, feeling, heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or, nausea, heat, stress, can, progress, into, heat, strain, which, entails, physiological, changes, such, as, increased, heart, rate, and, core, body, temperature, this, can, lead, to, heat, related, illnesses, such, as, heat, rash, cramps, exhaustion, or, heat, stroke, various, factors, can, contribute, to, the, risks, posed, by, heat, stress, including, strenuous, work, personal, risk, factors, such, as, age, and, fitness, dehydration, sleep, deprivation, and, burdensome, personal, protective, equipment, rest, cool, water, and, occasional, breaks, are, crucial, to, mitigating, the, effects, of, heat, stress, smoke, ash, and, debris, can, also, pose, serious, respiratory, hazards, for, wildland, firefighters, the, smoke, and, dust, from, wildfires, can, contain, gases, such, as, carbon, monoxide, sulfur, dioxide, and, formaldehyde, as, well, as, particulates, such, as, ash, and, silica, to, reduce, smoke, exposure, wildfire, fighting, crews, should, whenever, possible, rotate, firefighters, through, areas, of, heavy, smoke, avoid, downwind, firefighting, use, equipment, rather, than, people, in, holding, areas, and, minimize, mop, up, camps, and, command, posts, should, also, be, located, upwind, of, wildfires, protective, clothing, and, equipment, can, also, help, minimize, exposure, to, smoke, and, ash, firefighters, are, also, at, risk, of, cardiac, events, including, strokes, and, heart, attacks, firefighters, should, maintain, good, physical, fitness, fitness, programs, medical, screening, and, examination, programs, which, include, stress, tests, can, minimize, the, risks, of, firefighting, cardiac, problems, other, injury, hazards, wildland, firefighters, face, include, slips, trips, falls, burns, scrapes, and, cuts, from, tools, and, equipment, being, struck, by, trees, vehicles, or, other, objects, plant, hazards, such, as, thorns, and, poison, ivy, snake, and, animal, bites, vehicle, crashes, electrocution, from, power, lines, or, lightning, storms, and, unstable, building, structures, fire, retardants, are, used, to, slow, wildfires, by, inhibiting, combustion, they, are, aqueous, solutions, of, ammonium, phosphates, and, ammonium, sulfates, as, well, as, thickening, agents, the, decision, to, apply, retardant, depends, on, the, magnitude, location, and, intensity, of, the, wildfire, in, certain, instances, fire, retardant, may, also, be, applied, as, a, precautionary, fire, defense, measure, typical, fire, retardants, contain, the, same, agents, as, fertilizers, fire, retardants, may, also, affect, water, quality, through, leaching, eutrophication, or, misapplication,

of, fire, retardant, wildfire, debris, ash, and, sediment, clog, rivers, and, reservoirs, increasing, the, risk, for, floods, and, erosion, that, ultimately, slow, and, or, damage, water, treatment, systems, there, is, continued, concern, of, fire, retardant, effects, on, land, water, wildlife, habitats, and, watershed, quality, additional, research, is, needed, however, on, the, positive, side, fire, retardant, specifically, its, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, components, has, been, shown, to, have, a, fertilizing, effect, on, nutrient, deprived, soils, and, thus, creates, a, temporary, increase, in, vegetation, wildfire, modeling, is, concerned, with, numerical, simulation, of, wildfires, to, comprehend, and, predict, fire, behavior, wildfire, modeling, aims, to, aid, wildfire, suppression, increase, the, safety, of, firefighters, and, the, public, and, minimize, damage, wildfire, modeling, can, also, aid, in, protecting, ecosystems, watersheds, and, air, quality, most, of, earth, s, weather, and, air, pollution, resides, in, the, troposphere, the, part, of, the, atmosphere, that, extends, from, the, surface, of, the, planet, to, a, height, of, about, 10, kilometers, 6, mi, the, vertical, lift, of, a, severe, thunderstorm, or, pyrocumulonimbus, can, be, enhanced, in, the, area, of, a, large, wildfire, which, can, propel, smoke, soot, black, carbon, and, other, particulate, matter, as, high, as, the, lower, stratosphere, previously, prevailing, scientific, theory, held, that, most, particles, in, the, stratosphere, came, from, volcanoes, but, smoke, and, other, wildfire, emissions, have, been, detected, from, the, lower, stratosphere, pyrocumulus, clouds, can, reach, 6, 100, meters, 20, 000, ft, over, wildfires, satellite, observation, of, smoke, plumes, from, wildfires, revealed, that, the, plumes, could, be, traced, intact, for, distances, exceeding, 1, 600, kilometers, 1, 000, mi, computer, aided, models, such, as, calpuff, may, help, predict, the, size, and, direction, of, wildfire, generated, smoke, plumes, by, using, atmospheric, dispersion, modeling, wildfires, can, affect, local, atmospheric, pollution, and, release, carbon,

extended, dry, hot, periods, such, places, include, the, vegetated, areas, of, australia, and, southeast, asia, the, veld, in, southern, africa, the, fynbos, in, the, western, cape, of, south, africa, the, forested, areas, of, the, united, states, and, canada, and, the, mediterranean, basin, high, severity, wildfire, creates, complex, early, seral, forest, habitat, also, called, snag, forest, habitat, which, often, has, higher, species, richness, and, diversity, than, unburned, old, forest, plant, and, animal, species, in, most, types, of, north, american, forests, evolved, with, fire, and, many, of, these, species, depend, on, wildfires, and, particularly, high, severity, fires, to, reproduce, and, grow, fire, helps, to, return, nutrients, from, plant, matter, back, to, the, soil, the, heat, from, fire, is, necessary, to, the, germination, of, certain, types, of, seeds, and, the, snags, dead, trees, and, early, successional, forests, created, by, high, severity, fire, create, habitat, conditions, that, are, beneficial, to, wildlife, early, successional, forests, created, by, high, severity, fire, support, some, of, the, highest, levels, of, native, biodiversity, found, in, temperate, conifer, forests, post, fire, logging, has, no, ecological, benefits, and, many, negative, impacts, the, same, is, often, true, for, post, fire, seeding, the, exclusion, of, wildfires, can, contribute, to, vegetation, regime, shifts, such, as, woody, plant, encroachment, although, some, ecosystems, rely, on, naturally, occurring, fires, to, regulate, growth, some, ecosystems, suffer, from, too, much, fire, such, as, the, chaparral, in, southern, california, and, lower, elevation, deserts, in, the, american, southwest, the, increased, fire, frequency, in, these, ordinarily, fire, dependent, areas, has, upset, natural, cycles, damaged, native, plant, communities, and, encouraged, the, growth, of, non, native, weeds, invasive, species, such, as, lygodium, microphyllum, and, bromus, tectorum, can, grow, rapidly, in, areas, that, were, damaged, by, fires, because, they, are, highly, flammable, they, can, increase, the, future, risk, of, fire, creating, a, positive, feedback, loop, that, increases, fire, frequency, and, further, alters, native, vegetation, communities, in, the, amazon, rainforest, drought, logging, cattle, ranching, practices, and, slash, and, burn, agriculture, damage, fire, resistant, forests, and, promote, the, growth, of, flammable, brush, creating, a, cycle, that, encourages, more, burning, fires, in, the, rainforest, threaten, its, collection, of, diverse, species, and, produce, large, amounts, of, co, 2, also, fires, in, the, rainforest, along, with, drought, and, human, involvement, could, damage, or, destroy, more, than, half, of, the, amazon, rainforest, by, 2030, wildfires, generate, ash, reduce, the, availability, of, organic, nutrients, and, cause, an, increase, in, water, runoff, eroding, other, nutrients, and, creating, flash, flood, conditions, a, 2003, wildfire, in, the, north, yorkshire, moors, burned, off, 2, 5, square, kilometers, 600, acres, of, heather, and, the, underlying, peat, layers, afterwards, wind, erosion, stripped, the, ash, and, the, exposed, soil, revealing, archaeological, remains, dating, to, 10, 000, bc, wildfires, can, also, have, an, effect, on, climate, change, increasing, the, amount, of, carbon, released, into, the, atmosphere, and, inhibiting, vegetation, growth, which, affects, overall, carbon, uptake, by, plants, debris, and, chemical, runoff, into, waterways, after, wildfires, can, make, drinking, water, sources, unsafe, though, it, is, challenging, to, quantify, the, impacts, of, wildfires, on, surface, water, quality, research, suggests, that, the, concentration, of, many, pollutants, increases, post, fire, the, impacts, occur, during, active, burning, and, up, to, years, later, increases, in, nutrients, and, total, suspended, sediments, can, happen, within, a, year, while, heavy, metal, concentrations, may, peak, 1, 2, years, after, a, wildfire, benzene, is, one, of, many, chemicals, that, have, been, found, in, drinking, water, systems, after, wildfires, benzene, can, permeate, certain, plastic, pipes, and, thus, require, long, times, to, be, removed, from, the, water, distribution, infrastructure, researchers, estimated, that, in, worst, case, scenarios, more, than, 286, days, of, constant, flushing, of, a, contaminated, hdpe, service, line, were, needed, to, reduce, benzene, below, safe, drinking, water, limits, temperature, increases, caused, by, fires, including, wildfires, can, cause, plastic, water, pipes, to, generate, toxic, chemicals, such, as, benzene, fire, adaptations, are, traits, of, plants, and, animals, that, help, them, survive, wildfire, or, to, use, resources, created, by, wildfire, these, traits, can, help, plants, and, animals, increase, their, survival, rates, during, a, fire, and, or, reproduce, offspring, after, a, fire, both, plants, and, animals, have, multiple, strategies, for, surviving, and, reproducing, after, fire, plants, in, wildfire, prone, ecosystems, often, survive, through, adaptations, to, their, local, fire, regime, such, adaptations, include, physical, protection, against, heat, increased, growth, after, a, fire, event, and, flammable, materials, that, encourage, fire, and, may, eliminate, competition, wildfire, risk, is, the, chance, that, a, wildfire, will, start, in, or, reach, a, particular, area, and, the, potential, loss, of, human, values, if, it, does, risk, is, dependent, on, variable, factors, such, as, human, activities, weather, patterns, availability, of, wildfire, fuels, and, the, availability, or, lack, of, resources, to, suppress, a, fire, wildfires, have, continually, been, a, threat, to, human, populations, however, human, induced, geographic, and, climatic, changes, are, exposing, populations, more, frequently, to, wildfires, and, increasing, wildfire, risk, it, is, speculated, that, the, increase, in, wildfires, arises, from, a, century, of, wildfire, suppression, coupled, with, the, rapid, expansion, of, human, developments, into, fire, prone, wildlands, wildfires, are, naturally, occurring, events, that, aid, in, promoting, forest, health, global, warming, and, climate, changes, are, causing, an, increase, in, temperatures, and, more, droughts, nationwide, which, contributes, to, an, increase, in, wildfire, risk, the, most, noticeable, adverse, effect, of, wildfires, is, the, destruction, of, property, however, hazardous, chemicals, released, also, significantly, impact, human, health, wildfire, smoke, is, composed, primarily, of, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, other, common, components, present, in, lower, concentrations, are, carbon, monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic, hydrocarbons, and, benzene, small, airborne, particulates, in, solid, form, or, liquid, droplets, are, also, present, in, smoke, and, ash, debris, 80, 90, of, wildfire, smoke, by, mass, is, within, the, fine, particle, size, class, of, 2, 5, micrometers, in, diameter, or, smaller, carbon, dioxide, in, smoke, poses, a, low, health, risk, due, to, its, low, toxicity, rather, carbon, monoxide, and, fine, particulate, matter, particularly, 2, 5, m, in, diameter, and, smaller, have, been, identified, as, the, major, health, threats, high, levels, of, heavy, metals, including, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and, copper, were, found, in, the, ash, debris, following, the, 2007, californian, wildfires, a, national, clean, up, campaign, was, organised, in, fear, of, the, health, effects, from, exposure, in, the, devastating, california, camp, fire, 2018, that, killed, 85, people, lead, levels, increased, by, around, 50, times, in, the, hours, following, the, fire, at, a, site, nearby, chico, zinc, concentration, also, increased, significantly, in, modesto, 150, miles, away, heavy, metals, such, as, manganese, and, calcium, were, found, in, numerous, california, fires, as, well, other, chemicals, are, considered, to, be, significant, hazards, but, are, found, in, concentrations, that, are, too, low, to, cause, detectable, health, effects, the, degree, of, wildfire, smoke, exposure, to, an, individual, is, dependent, on, the, length, severity, duration, and, proximity, of, the, fire, people, are, exposed, directly, to, smoke, via, the, respiratory, tract, through, inhalation, of, air, pollutants, indirectly, communities, are, exposed, to, wildfire, debris, that, can, contaminate, soil, and, water, supplies, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, epa, developed, the, air, quality, index, aqi, a, public, resource, that, provides, national, air, quality, standard, concentrations, for, common, air, pollutants, the, public, can, use, it, to, determine, their, exposure, to, hazardous, air, pollutants, based, on, visibility, range, wildfire, smoke, contains, particulates, that, may, have, adverse, effects, upon, the, human, respiratory, system, evidence, of, the, health, effects, should, be, relayed, to, the, public, so, that, exposure, may, be, limited, the, evidence, can, also, be, used, to, influence, policy, to, promote, positive, health, outcomes, inhalation, of, smoke, from, a, wildfire, can, be, a, health, hazard, wildfire, smoke, is, composed, of, combustion, products, i, e, carbon, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, water, vapor, particulate, matter, organic, chemicals, nitrogen, oxides, and, other, compounds, the, principal, health, concern, is, the, inhalation, of, particulate, matter, and, carbon, monoxide, particulate, matter, pm, is, a, type, of, air, pollution, made, up, of, particles, of, dust, and, liquid, droplets, they, are, characterized, into, three, categories, based, on, particle, diameter, coarse, pm, fine, pm, and, ultrafine, pm, coarse, particles, are, between, 2, 5, micrometers, and, 10, micrometers, fine, particles, measure, 0, 1, to, 2, 5, micrometers, and, ultrafine, particle, are, less, than, 0, 1, micrometer, lmpact, on, the, body, upon, inhalation, varies, by, size, coarse, pm, is, filtered, by, the, upper, airways, and, can, accumulate, and, cause, pulmonary, inflammation, this, can, result, in, eye, and, sinus, irritation, as, well, as, sore, throat, and, coughing, coarse, pm, is, often, composed, of, heavier, and, more, toxic, materials, that, lead, to, short, term, effects, with, stronger, impact, smaller, pm, moves, further, into, the, respiratory, system, creating, issues, deep, into, the, lungs, and, the, bloodstream, in, asthma, patients, pm, 2, 5, causes, inflammation, but, also, increases, oxidative, stress, in, the, epithelial, cells, these, particulates, also, cause, apoptosis, and, autophagy, in, lung, epithelial, cells, both, processes, damage, the, cells, and, impact, cell, function, this, damage, impacts, those, with, respiratory, conditions, such, as, asthma, where, the, lung, tissues, and, function, are, already, compromised, particulates, less, than, 0, 1, micrometer, are, called, ultrafine, particle, ufp, it, is, a, major, component, of, wildfire, smoke, ufp, can, enter, the, bloodstream, like, pm, 2, 5, 0, 1, however, studies, show, that, it, works, into, the, blood, much, quicker, the, inflammation, and, epithelial, damage, done, by, ufp, has, also, shown, to, be, much, more, severe, pm, 2, 5, is, of, the, largest, concern, in, regards, to, wildfire, this, is, particularly, hazardous, to, the, very, young, elderly, and, those, with, chronic, conditions, such, as, asthma, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, cystic, fibrosis, and, cardiovascular, conditions, the, illnesses, most, commonly, associated, with, exposure, to, fine, pm, from, wildfire, smoke, are, bronchitis, exacerbation, of, asthma, or, copd, and, pneumonia, symptoms, of, these, complications, include, wheezing, and, shortness, of, breath, and, cardiovascular, symptoms, include, chest, pain, rapid, heart, rate, and, fatigue, several, epidemiological, studies, have, demonstrated, a, close, association, between, air, pollution, and, respiratory, allergic, diseases, such, as, bronchial, asthma, an, observational, study, of, smoke, exposure, related, to, the, 2007, san, diego, wildfires, revealed, an, increase, both, in, healthcare, utilization, and, respiratory, diagnoses, especially, asthma, among, the, group, sampled, projected, climate, scenarios, of, wildfire, occurrences, predict, significant, increases, in, respiratory, conditions, among, young, children, pm, triggers, a, series, of, biological, processes, including, inflammatory, immune, response, oxidative, stress, which, are, associated, with, harmful, changes, in, allergic, respiratory, diseases, although, some, studies, demonstrated, no, significant, acute, changes, in, lung, function, among, people, with, asthma, related, to, pm, from, wildfires, a, possible, explanation, for, these, counterintuitive, findings, is, the, increased, use, of, quick, relief, medications, such, as, inhalers, in, response, to, elevated, levels, of, smoke, among, those, already, diagnosed, with, asthma, there, is, consistent, evidence, between, wildfire, smoke, and, the, exacerbation, of, asthma, asthma, is, one, of, the, most, common, chronic, disease, among, children, in, the, united, states, affecting, an, estimated, 6, 2, million, children, research, on, asthma, risk, focuses, specifically, on, the, risk, of, air, pollution, during, the, gestational, period, several, pathophysiology, processes, are, involved, in, this, considerable, airway, development, occurs, during, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, trimesters, and, continues, until, 3, years, of, age, it, is, hypothesized, that, exposure, to, these, toxins, during, this, period, could, have, consequential, effects, as, the, epithelium, of, the, lungs, during, this, time, could, have, increased, permeability, to, toxins, exposure, to, air, pollution, during, parental, and, pre, natal, stage, could, induce, epigenetic, changes, which, are, responsible, for, the, development, of, asthma, studies, have, found, significant, association, between, pm, 2, 5, no, 2, and, development, of, asthma, during, childhood, despite, heterogeneity, among, studies, furthermore, maternal, exposure, to, chronic, stressors, is, most, likely, present, in, distressed, communities, and, as, this, can, be, correlated, with, childhood, asthma, it, may, further, explain, links, between, early, childhood, exposure, to, air, pollution, neighborhood, poverty, and, childhood, risk, carbon, monoxide, co, is, a, colorless, odorless, gas, that, can, be, found, at, the, highest, concentration, at, close, proximity, to, a, smoldering, fire, thus, it, is, a, serious, threat, to, the, health, of, wildfire, firefighters, co, in, smoke, can, be, inhaled, into, the, lungs, where, it, is, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, and, reduces, oxygen, delivery, to, the, body, s, vital, organs, at, high, concentrations, it, can, cause, headaches, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual, impairment, coma, and, even, death, even, at, lower, concentrations, such, as, those, found, at, wildfires, individuals, with, cardiovascular, disease, may, experience, chest, pain, and, cardiac, arrhythmia, a, recent, study, tracking, the, number, and, cause, of, wildfire, firefighter, deaths, from, 1990, to, 2006, found, that, 21, 9, of, the, deaths, occurred, from, heart, attacks, another, important, and, somewhat, less, obvious, health, effect, of, wildfires, is, psychiatric, diseases, and, disorders, both, adults, and, children, from, various, countries, who, were, directly, and, indirectly, affected, by, wildfires, were, found, to, demonstrate, different, mental, conditions, linked, to, their, experience, with, the, wildfires, these, include, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, depression, anxiety, and, phobias, the, western, us, has, seen, an, increase, in, both, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, wildfires, over, the, last, several, decades, this, has, been, attributed, to, the, arid, climate, of, there, and, the, effects, of, global, warming, an, estimated, 46, million, people, were, exposed, to, wildfire, smoke, from, 2004, to, 2009, in, the, western, us, evidence, has, demonstrated, that, wildfire, smoke, can, increase, levels, of, airborne, particulate, the, epa, has, defined, acceptable, concentrations, of, pm, in, the, air, through, the, national, ambient, air, quality, standards, and, monitoring, of, ambient, air, quality, has, been, mandated, due, to, these, monitoring, programs, and, the, incidence, of, several, large, wildfires, near, populated, areas, epidemiological, studies, have, been, conducted, and, demonstrate, an, association, between, human, health, effects, and, an, increase, in, fine, particulate, matter, due, to, wildfire, smoke, an, increase, in, pm, smoke, emitted, from, the, hayman, fire, in, colorado, in, june, 2002, was, associated, with, an, increase, in, respiratory, symptoms, in, patients, with, copd, looking, at, the, wildfires, in, southern, california, in, 2003, investigators, have, shown, an, increase, in, hospital, admissions, due, to, asthma, symptoms, while, being, exposed, to, peak, concentrations, of, pm, in, smoke, another, epidemiological, study, found, a, 7, 2, 95, confidence, interval, 0, 25, 15, increase, in, risk, of, respiratory, related, hospital, admissions, during, smoke, wave, days, with, high, wildfire, specific, particulate, matter, 2, 5, compared, to, matched, non, smoke, wave, days, children, participating, in, the, children, s, health, study, were, also, found, to, have, an, increase, in, eye, and, respiratory, symptoms, medication, use, and, physician, visits, mothers, who, were, pregnant, during, the, fires, gave, birth, to, babies, with, a, slightly, reduced, average, birth, weight, compared, to, those, who, were, not, exposed, suggesting, that, pregnant, women, may, also, be, at, greater, risk, to, adverse, effects, from, wildfire, worldwide, it, is, estimated, that, 339, 000, people, die, due, to, the, effects, of, wildfire, smoke, each, year, besides, the, size, of, pm, their, chemical, composition, should, also, be, considered, antecedent, studies, have, demonstrated, that, the, chemical, composition, of, pm, 2, 5, from, wildfire, smoke, can, yield, different, estimates, of, human, health, outcomes, as, compared, to, other, sources, of, smoke, such, as, solid, fuels, after, a, wildfire, hazards, remain, residents, returning, to, their, homes, may, be, at, risk, from, falling, fire, weakened, trees, humans, and, pets, may, also, be, harmed, by, falling, into, ash, pits, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, also, reports, that, wildfires, cause, significant, damage, to, electric, systems, especially, in, dry, regions, chemically, contaminated, drinking, water, at, levels, of, hazardous, waste, concern, is, a, growing, problem, in, particular, hazardous, waste, scale, chemical, contamination, of, buried, water, systems, was, first, discovered, in, the, u, s, in, 2017, and, has, since, been, increasingly, documented, in, hawaii, colorado, and, oregon, after, wildfires, in, 2021, canadian, authorities, adapted, their, post, fire, public, safety, investigation, approaches, in, british, columbia, to, screen, for, this, risk, but, have, not, found, it, as, of, 2023, another, challenge, is, that, private, drinking, wells, and, the, plumbing, within, a, building, can, also, become, chemically, contaminated, and, unsafe, households, experience, a, wide, variety, of, significant, economic, and, health, impacts, related, to, this, contaminated, water, evidence, based, guidance, on, how, to, inspect, and, test, wildfire, impacted, wells, and, building, water, systems, was, developed, for, the, first, time, in, 2020, in, paradise, california, for, example, the, 2018, camp, fire, caused, more, than, 150, million, dollars, worth, of, damage, this, required, almost, a, year, of, time, to, decontaminate, and, repair, the, municipal, drinking, water, system, from, wildfire, damage, the, source, of, this, contamination, was, first, proposed, after, the, 2018, camp, fire, in, california, as, originating, from, thermally, degraded, plastics, in, water, systems, smoke, and, vapors, entering, depressurized, plumbing, and, contaminated, water, in, buildings, being, sucked, into, the, municipal, water, system, in, 2020, it, was, first, shown, that, thermal, degradation, of, plastic, drinking, water, materials, was, one, potential, contamination, source, in, 2023, the, second, theory, was, confirmed, where, contamination, could, be, sucked, into, pipes, that, lost, water, pressure, other, post, fire, risks, can, increase, if, other, extreme, weather, follows, for, example, wildfires, make, soil, less, able, to, absorb, precipitation, so, heavy, rainfall, can, result, in, more, severe, flooding, and, damages, like, mud, slides, firefighters, are, at, greatest, risk, for, acute, and, chronic, health, effects, resulting, from, wildfire, smoke, exposure, due, to, firefighters, occupational, duties, they, are, frequently, exposed, to, hazardous, chemicals, at, close, proximity, for, longer, periods, of, time, a, case, study, on, the, exposure, of, wildfire, smoke, among, wildland, firefighters, shows, that, firefighters, are, exposed, to, significant, levels, of, carbon, monoxide, and, respiratory, irritants, above, osha, permissible, exposure, limits, pel, and, acgih, threshold, limit, values, tlv, 5, 10, are, overexposed, between, 2001, and, 2012, over, 200, fatalities, occurred, among, wildland, firefighters, in, addition, to, heat, and, chemical, hazards, firefighters, are, also, at, risk, for, electrocution, from, power, lines, injuries, from, equipment, slips, trips, and, falls, injuries, from, vehicle, rollovers, heat, related, illness, insect, bites, and, stings, stress, and, rhabdomyolysis, residents, in, communities, surrounding, wildfires, are, exposed, to, lower, concentrations, of, chemicals, but, they, are, at, a, greater, risk, for, indirect, exposure, through, water, or, soil, contamination, exposure, to, residents, is, greatly, dependent, on, individual, susceptibility, vulnerable, persons, such, as, children, ages, 0, 4, the, elderly, ages, 65, and, older, smokers, and, pregnant, women, are, at, an, increased, risk, due, to, their, already, compromised, body, systems, even, when, the, exposures, are, present, at, low, chemical, concentrations, and, for, relatively, short, exposure, periods, they, are, also, at, risk, for, future, wildfires, and, may, move, away, to, areas, they, consider, less, risky, wildfires, affect, large, numbers, of, people, in, western, canada, and, the, united, states, in, california, alone, more, than, 350, 000, people, live, in, towns, and, cities, in, very, high, fire, hazard, severity, zones, direct, risks, to, building, residents, in, fire, prone, areas, can, be, moderated, through, design, choices, such, as, choosing, fire, resistant, vegetation, maintaining, landscaping, to, avoid, debris, accumulation, and, to, create, firebreaks, and, by, selecting, fire, retardant, roofing, materials, potential, compounding, issues, with, poor, air, quality, and, heat, during, warmer, months, may, be, addressed, with, merv, 11, or, higher, outdoor, air, filtration, in, building, ventilation, systems, mechanical, cooling, and, a, provision, of, a, refuge, area, with, additional, air, cleaning, and, cooling, if, needed, the, first, evidence, of, wildfires, is, fossils, of, the, giant, fungi, prototaxites, preserved, as, charcoal, discovered, in, south, wales, and, poland, dating, to, the, silurian, period, about, 430, million, years, ago, smoldering, surface, fires, started, to, occur, sometime, before, the, early, devonian, period, 405, million, years, ago, low, atmospheric, oxygen, during, the, middle, and, late, devonian, was, accompanied, by, a, decrease, in, charcoal, abundance, additional, charcoal, evidence, suggests, that, fires, continued, through, the, carboniferous, period, later, the, overall, increase, of, atmospheric, oxygen, from, 13, in, the, late, devonian, to, 30, 31, by, the, late, permian, was, accompanied, by, a, more, widespread, distribution, of, wildfires, later, a, decrease, in, wildfire, related, charcoal, deposits, from, the, late, permian, to, the, triassic, periods, is, explained, by, a, decrease, in, oxygen, levels, wildfires, during, the, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, periods, followed, patterns, similar, to, fires, that, occur, in, modern, times, surface, fires, driven, by, dry, seasons, are, evident, in, devonian, and, carboniferous, progymnosperm, forests, lepidodendron, forests, dating, to, the, carboniferous, period, have, charred, peaks, evidence, of, crown, fires, in, jurassic, gymnosperm, forests, there, is, evidence, of, high, frequency, light, surface, fires, the, increase, of, fire, activity, in, the, late, tertiary, is, possibly, due, to, the, increase, of, c, 4, type, grasses, as, these, grasses, shifted, to, more, mesic, habitats, their, high, flammability, increased, fire, frequency, promoting, grasslands, over, woodlands, however, fire, prone, habitats, may, have, contributed, to, the, prominence, of, trees, such, as, those, of, the, genera, eucalyptus, pinus, and, sequoia, which, have, thick, bark, to, withstand, fires, and, employ, pyriscence, the, human, use, of, fire, for, agricultural, and, hunting, purposes, during, the, paleolithic, and, mesolithic, ages, altered, pre, existing, landscapes, and, fire, regimes, woodlands, were, gradually, replaced, by, smaller, vegetation, that, facilitated, travel, hunting, seed, gathering, and, planting, in, recorded, human, history, minor, allusions, to, wildfires, were, mentioned, in, the, bible, and, by, classical, writers, such, as, homer, however, while, ancient, hebrew, greek, and, roman, writers, were, aware, of, fires, they, were, not, very, interested, in, the, uncultivated, lands, where, wildfires, occurred, wildfires, were, used, in, battles, throughout, human, history, as, early, thermal, weapons, from, the, middle, ages, accounts, were, written, of, occupational, burning, as, well, as, customs, and, laws, that, governed, the, use, of, fire, in, germany, regular, burning, was, documented, in, 1290, in, the, odenwald, and, in, 1344, in, the, black, forest, in, the, 14th, century, sardinia, firebreaks, were, used, for, wildfire, protection, in, spain, during, the, 1550s, sheep, husbandry, was, discouraged, in, certain, provinces, by, philip, ii, due, to, the, harmful, effects, of, fires, used, in, transhumance, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, native, americans, were, observed, using, fire, for, many, purposes, including, cultivation, signaling, and, warfare, scottish, botanist, david, douglas, noted, the, native, use, of, fire, for, tobacco, cultivation, to, encourage, deer, into, smaller, areas, for, hunting, purposes, and, to, improve, foraging, for, honey, and, grasshoppers, charcoal, found, in, sedimentary, deposits, off, the, pacific, coast, of, central, america, suggests, that, more, burning, occurred, in, the, 50, years, before, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, than, after, the, colonization, in, the, post, world, war, ii, baltic, region, socio, economic, changes, led, more, stringent, air, quality, standards, and, bans, on, fires, that, eliminated, traditional, burning, practices, in, the, mid, 19th, century, explorers, from, hms, beagle, observed, australian, aborigines, using, fire, for, ground, clearing, hunting, and, regeneration, of, plant, food, in, a, method, later, named, fire, stick, farming, such, careful, use, of, fire, has, been, employed, for, centuries, in, lands, protected, by, kakadu, national, park, to, encourage, biodiversity, wildfires, typically, occur, during, periods, of, increased, temperature, and, drought, an, increase, in, fire, related, debris, flow, in, alluvial, fans, of, northeastern, yellowstone, national, park, was, linked, to, the, period, between, ad, 1050, and, 1200, coinciding, with, the, medieval, warm, period, however, human, influence, caused, an, increase, in, fire, frequency, dendrochronological, fire, scar, data, and, charcoal, layer, data, in, finland, suggests, that, while, many, fires, occurred, during, severe, drought, conditions, an, increase, in, the, number, of, fires, during, 850, bc, and, 1660, ad, can, be, attributed, to, human, influence, charcoal, evidence, from, the, americas, suggested, a, general, decrease, in, wildfires, between, 1, ad, and, 1750, compared, to, previous, years, however, a, period, of, increased, fire, frequency, between, 1750, and, 1870, was, suggested, by, charcoal, data, from, north, america, and, asia, attributed, to, human, population, growth, and, influences, such, as, land, clearing, practices, this, period, was, followed, by, an, overall, decrease, in, burning, in, the, 20th, century, linked, to, the, expansion, of, agriculture, increased, livestock, grazing, and, fire, prevention, efforts, a, meta, analysis, found, that, 17, times, more, land, burned, annually, in, california, before, 1800, compared, to, recent, decades, 1, 800, 000, hectares, year, compared, to, 102, 000, hectares, year, according, to, a, paper, published, in, the, journal, science, the, number, of, natural, and, human, caused, fires, decreased, by, 24, 3, between, 1998, and, 2015, researchers, explain, this, as, a, transition, from, nomadism, to, settled, lifestyle, and, intensification, of, agriculture, that, lead, to, a, drop, in, the, use, of, fire, for, land, clearing, increases, of, certain, tree, species, i, e, conifers, over, others, i, e, deciduous, trees, can, increase, wildfire, risk, especially, if, these, trees, are, also, planted, in, monocultures, some, invasive, species, moved, in, by, humans, i, e, for, the, pulp, and, paper, industry, have, in, some, cases, also, increased, the, intensity, of, wildfires, examples, include, species, such, as, eucalyptus, in, california, and, gamba, grass, in, australia, wildfires, have, a, place, in, many, cultures, to, spread, like, wildfire, is, a, common, idiom, in, english, meaning, something, that, quickly, affects, or, becomes, known, by, more, and, more, people, wildfire, activity, has, been, attributed, as, a, major, factor, in, the, development, of, ancient, greece, in, modern, greece, as, in, many, other, regions, it, is, the, most, common, disaster, caused, by, a, natural, hazard, and, figures, prominently, in, the, social, and, economic, lives, of, its, people, in, 1937, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, initiated, a, nationwide, fire, prevention, campaign, highlighting, the, role, of, human, carelessness, in, forest, fires, later, posters, of, the, program, featured, uncle, sam, characters, from, the, disney, movie, bambi, and, the, official, mascot, of, the, u, s, forest, service, smokey, bear, the, smokey, bear, fire, prevention, campaign, has, yielded, one, of, the, most, popular, characters, in, the, united, states, for, many, years, there, was, a, living, smokey, bear, mascot, and, it, has, been, commemorated, on, postage, stamps, there, are, also, significant, indirect, or, second, order, societal, impacts, from, wildfire, such, as, demands, on, utilities, to, prevent, power, transmission, equipment, from, becoming, ignition, sources, and, the, cancelation, or, nonrenewal, of, homeowners, insurance, for, residents, living, in, wildfire, prone, areas,
