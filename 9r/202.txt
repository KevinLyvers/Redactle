galaxy, morphological, classification, is, a, system, used, by, astronomers, to, divide, galaxies, into, groups, based, on, their, visual, appearance, there, are, several, schemes, in, use, by, which, galaxies, can, be, classified, according, to, their, morphologies, the, most, famous, being, the, hubble, sequence, devised, by, edwin, hubble, and, later, expanded, by, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, and, allan, sandage, however, galaxy, classification, and, morphology, are, now, largely, done, using, computational, methods, and, physical, morphology, the, hubble, sequence, is, a, morphological, classification, scheme, for, galaxies, invented, by, edwin, hubble, in, 1926, it, is, often, known, colloquially, as, the, hubble, tuning, fork, because, of, the, shape, in, which, it, is, traditionally, represented, hubble, s, scheme, divides, galaxies, into, three, broad, classes, based, on, their, visual, appearance, originally, on, photographic, plates, these, broad, classes, can, be, extended, to, enable, finer, distinctions, of, appearance, and, to, encompass, other, types, of, galaxies, such, as, irregular, galaxies, which, have, no, obvious, regular, structure, either, disk, like, or, ellipsoidal, the, hubble, sequence, is, often, represented, in, the, form, of, a, two, pronged, fork, with, the, ellipticals, on, the, left, with, the, degree, of, ellipticity, increasing, from, left, to, right, and, the, barred, and, unbarred, spirals, forming, the, two, parallel, prongs, of, the, fork, on, the, right, lenticular, galaxies, are, placed, between, the, ellipticals, and, the, spirals, at, the, point, where, the, two, prongs, meet, the, handle, to, this, day, the, hubble, sequence, is, the, most, commonly, used, system, for, classifying, galaxies, both, in, professional, astronomical, research, and, in, amateur, astronomy, nonetheless, in, june, 2019, citizen, scientists, through, galaxy, zoo, reported, that, the, usual, hubble, classification, particularly, concerning, spiral, galaxies, may, not, be, supported, and, may, need, updating, the, de, vaucouleurs, system, for, classifying, galaxies, is, a, widely, used, extension, to, the, hubble, sequence, first, described, by, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, in, 1959, de, vaucouleurs, argued, that, hubble, s, two, dimensional, classification, of, spiral, galaxies, based, on, the, tightness, of, the, spiral, arms, and, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, bar, did, not, adequately, describe, the, full, range, of, observed, galaxy, morphologies, in, particular, he, argued, that, rings, and, lenses, are, important, structural, components, of, spiral, galaxies, the, de, vaucouleurs, system, retains, hubble, s, basic, division, of, galaxies, into, ellipticals, lenticulars, spirals, and, irregulars, to, complement, hubble, s, scheme, de, vaucouleurs, introduced, a, more, elaborate, classification, system, for, spiral, galaxies, based, on, three, morphological, characteristics, the, different, elements, of, the, classification, scheme, are, combined, in, the, order, in, which, they, are, listed, to, give, the, complete, classification, of, a, galaxy, for, example, a, weakly, barred, spiral, galaxy, with, loosely, wound, arms, and, a, ring, is, denoted, sab, r, c, visually, the, de, vaucouleurs, system, can, be, represented, as, a, three, dimensional, version, of, hubble, s, tuning, fork, with, stage, spiralness, on, the, x, axis, family, barredness, on, the, y, axis, and, variety, ringedness, on, the, z, axis, de, vaucouleurs, also, assigned, numerical, values, to, each, class, of, galaxy, in, his, scheme, values, of, the, numerical, hubble, stage, t, run, from, 6, to, 10, with, negative, numbers, corresponding, to, early, type, galaxies, ellipticals, and, lenticulars, and, positive, numbers, to, late, types, spirals, and, irregulars, thus, as, a, rough, rule, lower, values, of, t, correspond, to, a, larger, fraction, of, the, stellar, mass, contained, in, a, spheroid, bulge, relative, to, the, disk, the, approximate, mapping, between, the, spheroid, to, total, stellar, mass, ratio, m, b, m, t, and, the, hubble, stage, is, m, b, m, t, 10, t, 2, 256, based, on, local, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, are, divided, into, three, stages, compact, ellipticals, ce, normal, ellipticals, e, and, late, types, e, lenticulars, are, similarly, subdivided, into, early, s, intermediate, s, 0, and, late, s, types, irregular, galaxies, can, be, of, type, magellanic, irregulars, t, 10, or, compact, t, 11, the, use, of, numerical, stages, allows, for, more, quantitative, studies, of, galaxy, morphology, the, yerkes, scheme, was, created, by, american, astronomer, william, wilson, morgan, together, with, philip, keenan, morgan, also, developed, the, mk, system, for, the, classification, of, stars, through, their, spectra, the, yerkes, scheme, uses, the, spectra, of, stars, in, the, galaxy, the, shape, real, and, apparent, and, the, degree, of, the, central, concentration, to, classify, galaxies, thus, for, example, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, classified, as, ks5
