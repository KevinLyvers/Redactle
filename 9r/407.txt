samarium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, sm, and, atomic, number, 62, it, is, a, moderately, hard, silvery, metal, that, slowly, oxidizes, in, air, being, a, typical, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, samarium, usually, has, the, oxidation, state, 3, compounds, of, samarium, ii, are, also, known, most, notably, the, monoxide, smo, monochalcogenides, sms, smse, and, smte, as, well, as, samarium, ii, iodide, discovered, in, 1879, by, french, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, samarium, was, named, after, the, mineral, samarskite, from, which, it, was, isolated, the, mineral, itself, was, named, after, a, russian, mine, official, colonel, vassili, samarsky, bykhovets, who, thus, became, the, first, person, to, have, a, chemical, element, named, after, him, though, the, name, was, indirect, samarium, occurs, in, concentration, up, to, 2, 8, in, several, minerals, including, cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite, and, bastn, site, the, last, two, being, the, most, common, commercial, sources, of, the, element, these, minerals, are, mostly, found, in, china, the, united, states, brazil, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, china, is, by, far, the, world, leader, in, samarium, mining, and, production, the, main, commercial, use, of, samarium, is, in, samarium, cobalt, magnets, which, have, permanent, magnetization, second, only, to, neodymium, magnets, however, samarium, compounds, can, withstand, significantly, higher, temperatures, above, 700, c, 1, 292, f, without, losing, their, permanent, magnetic, properties, the, radioisotope, samarium, 153, is, the, active, component, of, the, drug, samarium, 153, sm, lexidronam, quadramet, which, kills, cancer, cells, in, lung, cancer, prostate, cancer, breast, cancer, and, osteosarcoma, another, isotope, samarium, 149, is, a, strong, neutron, absorber, and, so, is, added, to, control, rods, of, nuclear, reactors, it, also, forms, as, a, decay, product, during, the, reactor, operation, and, is, one, of, the, important, factors, considered, in, the, reactor, design, and, operation, other, uses, of, samarium, include, catalysis, of, chemical, reactions, radioactive, dating, and, x, ray, lasers, samarium, ii, iodide, in, particular, is, a, common, reducing, agent, in, chemical, synthesis, samarium, has, no, biological, role, some, samarium, salts, are, slightly, toxic, samarium, is, a, rare, earth, element, with, a, hardness, and, density, similar, to, zinc, with, a, boiling, point, of, 1, 794, c, 3, 261, f, samarium, is, the, third, most, volatile, lanthanide, after, ytterbium, and, europium, and, comparable, in, this, respect, to, lead, and, barium, this, helps, separation, of, samarium, from, its, ores, when, freshly, prepared, samarium, has, a, silvery, lustre, and, takes, on, a, duller, appearance, when, oxidized, in, air, samarium, is, calculated, to, have, one, of, the, largest, atomic, radii, of, the, elements, with, a, radius, of, 238, pm, only, potassium, praseodymium, barium, rubidium, and, caesium, are, larger, in, ambient, conditions, samarium, has, a, rhombohedral, structure, form, upon, heating, to, 731, c, 1, 348, f, its, crystal, symmetry, changes, to, hexagonal, close, packed, hcp, it, has, actual, transition, temperature, depending, on, metal, purity, further, heating, to, 922, c, 1, 692, f, transforms, the, metal, into, a, body, centered, cubic, bcc, phase, heating, to, 300, c, 572, f, plus, compression, to, 40, kbar, results, in, a, double, hexagonally, close, packed, structure, dhcp, higher, pressure, of, the, order, of, hundreds, or, thousands, of, kilobars, induces, a, series, of, phase, transformations, in, particular, with, a, tetragonal, phase, appearing, at, about, 900, kbar, in, one, study, the, dhcp, phase, could, be, produced, without, compression, using, a, nonequilibrium, annealing, regime, with, a, rapid, temperature, change, between, about, 400, c, 752, f, and, 700, c, 1, 292, f, confirming, the, transient, character, of, this, samarium, phase, thin, films, of, samarium, obtained, by, vapor, deposition, may, contain, the, hcp, or, dhcp, phases, in, ambient, conditions, samarium, and, its, sesquioxide, are, paramagnetic, at, room, temperature, their, corresponding, effective, magnetic, moments, below, 2, bohr, magnetons, are, the, third, lowest, among, lanthanides, and, their, oxides, after, lanthanum, and, lutetium, the, metal, transforms, to, an, antiferromagnetic, state, upon, cooling, to, 14, 8, k, individual, samarium, atoms, can, be, isolated, by, encapsulating, them, into, fullerene, molecules, they, can, also, be, intercalated, into, the, interstices, of, the, bulk, c, 60, to, form, a, solid, solution, of, nominal, composition, sm, 3, c, 60, which, is, superconductive, at, a, temperature, of, 8, k, samarium, doping, of, iron, based, superconductors, a, class, of, high, temperature, superconductor, increases, their, transition, to, normal, conductivity, temperature, up, to, 56, k, the, highest, value, achieved, so, far, in, this, series, in, air, samarium, slowly, oxidizes, at, room, temperature, and, spontaneously, ignites, at, 150, c, 302, f, even, when, stored, under, mineral, oil, samarium, gradually, oxidizes, and, develops, a, grayish, yellow, powder, of, the, oxide, hydroxide, mixture, at, the, surface, the, metallic, appearance, of, a, sample, can, be, preserved, by, sealing, it, under, an, inert, gas, such, as, argon, samarium, is, quite, electropositive, and, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, rapidly, with, hot, water, to, form, samarium, hydroxide, samarium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, yellow, to, pale, green, sm, iii, ions, which, exist, as, 3, complexes, samarium, is, one, of, the, few, lanthanides, with, a, relatively, accessible, 2, oxidation, state, alongside, eu, and, yb, sm, 2, ions, are, blood, red, in, aqueous, solution, the, most, stable, oxide, of, samarium, is, the, sesquioxide, sm, 2, o, 3, like, many, samarium, compounds, it, exists, in, several, crystalline, phases, the, trigonal, form, is, obtained, by, slow, cooling, from, the, melt, the, melting, point, of, sm, 2, o, 3, is, high, 2345, c, so, it, is, usually, melted, not, by, direct, heating, but, with, induction, heating, through, a, radio, frequency, coil, sm, 2, o, 3, crystals, of, monoclinic, symmetry, can, be, grown, by, the, flame, fusion, method, verneuil, process, from, sm, 2, o, 3, powder, that, yields, cylindrical, boules, up, to, several, centimeters, long, and, about, one, centimeter, in, diameter, the, boules, are, transparent, when, pure, and, defect, free, and, are, orange, otherwise, heating, the, metastable, trigonal, sm, 2, o, 3, to, 1, 900, c, 3, 450, f, converts, it, to, the, more, stable, monoclinic, phase, cubic, sm, 2, o, 3, has, also, been, described, samarium, is, one, of, the, few, lanthanides, that, form, a, monoxide, smo, this, lustrous, golden, yellow, compound, was, obtained, by, reducing, sm, 2, o, 3, with, samarium, metal, at, high, temperature, 1000, c, and, a, pressure, above, 50, kbar, lowering, the, pressure, resulted, in, incomplete, reaction, smo, has, cubic, rock, salt, lattice, structure, samarium, forms, a, trivalent, sulfide, selenide, and, telluride, divalent, chalcogenides, sms, smse, and, smte, with, a, cubic, rock, salt, crystal, structure, are, known, these, chalcogenides, convert, from, a, semiconducting, to, metallic, state, at, room, temperature, upon, application, of, pressure, whereas, the, transition, is, continuous, and, occurs, at, about, 20, 30, kbar, in, smse, and, smte, it, is, abrupt, in, sms, and, requires, only, 6, 5, kbar, this, effect, results, in, a, spectacular, color, change, in, sms, from, black, to, golden, yellow, when, its, crystals, of, films, are, scratched, or, polished, the, transition, does, not, change, the, lattice, symmetry, but, there, is, a, sharp, decrease, 15, in, the, crystal, volume, it, exhibits, hysteresis, i, e, when, the, pressure, is, released, sms, returns, to, the, semiconducting, state, at, a, much, lower, pressure, of, about, 0, 4, kbar, samarium, metal, reacts, with, all, the, halogens, forming, trihalides, their, further, reduction, with, samarium, lithium, or, sodium, metals, at, elevated, temperatures, about, 700, 900, c, yields, the, dihalides, the, diiodide, can, also, be, prepared, by, heating, smi, 3, or, by, reacting, the, metal, with, 1, 2, diiodoethane, in, anhydrous, tetrahydrofuran, at, room, temperature, in, addition, to, dihalides, the, reduction, also, produces, many, non, stoichiometric, samarium, halides, with, a, well, defined, crystal, structure, such, as, sm, 3, f, 7, sm, 14, f, 33, sm, 27, f, 64, sm, 11, br, 24, sm, 5, br, 11, and, sm, 6, br, 13, samarium, halides, change, their, crystal, structures, when, one, type, of, halide, anion, is, substituted, for, another, which, is, an, uncommon, behavior, for, most, elements, e, g, actinides, many, halides, have, two, major, crystal, phases, for, one, composition, one, being, significantly, more, stable, and, another, being, metastable, the, latter, is, formed, upon, compression, or, heating, followed, by, quenching, to, ambient, conditions, for, example, compressing, the, usual, monoclinic, samarium, diiodide, and, releasing, the, pressure, results, in, a, pbcl, 2, type, orthorhombic, structure, density, 5, 90, g, cm, 3, and, similar, treatment, results, in, a, new, phase, of, samarium, triiodide, density, 5, 97, g, cm, 3, sintering, powders, of, samarium, oxide, and, boron, in, a, vacuum, yields, a, powder, containing, several, samarium, boride, phases, the, ratio, between, these, phases, can, be, controlled, through, the, mixing, proportion, the, powder, can, be, converted, into, larger, crystals, of, samarium, borides, using, arc, melting, or, zone, melting, techniques, relying, on, the, different, melting, crystallization, temperature, of, smb, 6, 2580, c, smb, 4, about, 2300, c, and, smb, 66, 2150, c, all, these, materials, are, hard, brittle, dark, gray, solids, with, the, hardness, increasing, with, the, boron, content, samarium, diboride, is, too, volatile, to, be, produced, with, these, methods, and, requires, high, pressure, about, 65, kbar, and, low, temperatures, between, 1140, and, 1240, c, to, stabilize, its, growth, increasing, the, temperature, results, in, the, preferential, formation, of, smb, 6, samarium, hexaboride, is, a, typical, intermediate, valence, compound, where, samarium, is, present, both, as, sm, 2, and, sm, 3, ions, in, a, 3, 7, ratio, it, belongs, to, a, class, of, kondo, insulators, at, temperatures, above, 50, k, its, properties, are, typical, of, a, kondo, metal, with, metallic, electrical, conductivity, characterized, by, strong, electron, scattering, whereas, at, lower, temperatures, it, behaves, as, a, non, magnetic, insulator, with, a, narrow, band, gap, of, about, 4, 14, mev, the, cooling, induced, metal, insulator, transition, in, smb, 6, is, accompanied, by, a, sharp, increase, in, the, thermal, conductivity, peaking, at, about, 15, k, the, reason, for, this, increase, is, that, electrons, themselves, do, not, contribute, to, the, thermal, conductivity, at, low, temperatures, which, is, dominated, by, phonons, but, the, decrease, in, electron, concentration, reduces, the, rate, of, electron, phonon, scattering, samarium, carbides, are, prepared, by, melting, a, graphite, metal, mixture, in, an, inert, atmosphere, after, the, synthesis, they, are, unstable, in, air, and, need, to, be, studied, under, an, inert, atmosphere, samarium, monophosphide, smp, is, a, semiconductor, with, a, bandgap, of, 1, 10, ev, the, same, as, in, silicon, and, electrical, conductivity, of, n, type, it, can, be, prepared, by, annealing, at, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, an, evacuated, quartz, ampoule, containing, mixed, powders, of, phosphorus, and, samarium, phosphorus, is, highly, volatile, at, high, temperatures, and, may, explode, thus, the, heating, rate, has, to, be, kept, well, below, 1, c, min, a, similar, procedure, is, adopted, for, the, monarsenide, smas, but, the, synthesis, temperature, is, higher, at, 1, 800, c, 3, 270, f, numerous, crystalline, binary, compounds, are, known, for, samarium, and, one, of, the, group, 14, 15, or, 16, elements, x, where, x, is, si, ge, sn, pb, sb, or, te, and, metallic, alloys, of, samarium, form, another, large, group, they, are, all, prepared, by, annealing, mixed, powders, of, the, corresponding, elements, many, of, the, resulting, compounds, are, non, stoichiometric, and, have, nominal, compositions, sm, a, x, b, where, the, b, a, ratio, varies, between, 0, 5, and, 3, samarium, forms, a, cyclopentadienide, sm, c, 5, h, 5, 3, and, its, chloroderivatives, sm, c, 5, h, 5, 2, cl, and, sm, c, 5, h, 5, cl, 2, they, are, prepared, by, reacting, samarium, trichloride, with, nac, 5, h, 5, in, tetrahydrofuran, contrary, to, cyclopentadienides, of, most, other, lanthanides, in, sm, c, 5, h, 5, 3, some, c, 5, h, 5, rings, bridge, each, other, by, forming, ring, vertexes, 1, or, edges, 2, toward, another, neighboring, samarium, thus, creating, polymeric, chains, the, chloroderivative, sm, c, 5, h, 5, 2, cl, has, a, dimer, structure, which, is, more, accurately, expressed, as, 5, c, 5, h, 5, 2, sm, cl, 2, 5, c, 5, h, 5, 2, there, the, chlorine, bridges, can, be, replaced, for, instance, by, iodine, hydrogen, or, nitrogen, atoms, or, by, cn, groups, the, c, 5, h, 5, ion, in, samarium, cyclopentadienides, can, be, replaced, by, the, indenide, c, 9, h, 7, or, cyclooctatetraenide, c, 8, h, 8, 2, ring, resulting, in, sm, c, 9, h, 7, 3, or, ksm, 8, c, 8, h, 8, 2, the, latter, compound, has, a, structure, similar, to, uranocene, there, is, also, a, cyclopentadienide, of, divalent, samarium, sm, c, 5, h, 5, 2, a, solid, that, sublimates, at, about, 85, c, 185, f, contrary, to, ferrocene, the, c, 5, h, 5, rings, in, sm, c, 5, h, 5, 2, are, not, parallel, but, are, tilted, by, 40, a, metathesis, reaction, in, tetrahydrofuran, or, ether, gives, alkyls, and, aryls, of, samarium, here, r, is, a, hydrocarbon, group, and, me, methyl, naturally, occurring, samarium, is, composed, of, five, stable, isotopes, 144, sm, 149, sm, 150, sm, 152, sm, and, 154, sm, and, two, extremely, long, lived, radioisotopes, 147, sm, half, life, t, 1, 2, 1, 06, 10, 11, years, and, 148, sm, 7, 10, 15, years, with, 152, sm, being, the, most, abundant, 26, 75, 149, sm, is, listed, by, various, sources, as, being, stable, but, some, sources, state, that, it, is, radioactive, with, a, lower, bound, for, its, half, life, given, as, 2, 10, 15, years, some, observationally, stable, samarium, isotopes, are, predicted, to, decay, to, isotopes, of, neodymium, the, long, lived, isotopes, 146, sm, 147, sm, and, 148, sm, undergo, alpha, decay, to, neodymium, isotopes, lighter, unstable, isotopes, of, samarium, mainly, decay, by, electron, capture, to, promethium, while, heavier, ones, beta, decay, to, europium, the, known, isotopes, range, from, 129, sm, to, 168, sm, the, half, lives, of, 151, sm, and, 145, sm, are, 90, years, and, 340, days, respectively, all, remaining, radioisotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 2, days, and, most, these, have, half, life, less, than, 48, seconds, samarium, also, has, twelve, known, nuclear, isomers, the, most, stable, of, which, are, 141m, sm, half, life, 22, 6, minutes, 143m1, sm, t, 1, 2, 66, seconds, and, 139m, sm, t, 1, 2, 10, 7, seconds, natural, samarium, has, a, radioactivity, of, 127, bq, g, mostly, due, to, 147, sm, which, alpha, decays, to, 143, nd, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 06, 10, 11, years, and, is, used, in, samarium, neodymium, dating, 146, sm, is, an, extinct, radionuclide, with, the, half, life, of, 9, 20, 10, 7, years, there, have, been, searches, of, samarium, 146, as, a, primordial, nuclide, because, its, half, life, is, long, enough, such, that, minute, quantities, of, the, element, should, persist, today, it, can, be, used, in, radiometric, dating, samarium, 149, is, an, observationally, stable, isotope, of, samarium, predicted, to, decay, but, no, decays, have, ever, been, observed, giving, it, a, half, life, at, least, several, orders, of, magnitude, longer, than, the, age, of, the, universe, and, a, product, of, the, decay, chain, from, the, fission, product, 149, nd, yield, 1, 0888, 149, sm, is, a, decay, product, and, neutron, absorber, in, nuclear, reactors, with, a, neutron, poison, effect, that, is, second, in, importance, for, reactor, design, and, operation, only, to, 135, xe, its, neutron, cross, section, is, 41000, barns, for, thermal, neutrons, because, samarium, 149, is, not, radioactive, and, is, not, removed, by, decay, it, presents, problems, somewhat, different, from, those, encountered, with, xenon, 135, the, equilibrium, concentration, and, thus, the, poisoning, effect, builds, to, an, equilibrium, value, during, reactor, operations, in, about, 500, hours, about, three, weeks, and, since, samarium, 149, is, stable, its, concentration, remains, essentially, constant, during, reactor, operation, samarium, 153, is, a, beta, emitter, with, a, half, life, of, 46, 3, hours, it, is, used, to, kill, cancer, cells, in, lung, cancer, prostate, cancer, breast, cancer, and, osteosarcoma, for, this, purpose, samarium, 153, is, chelated, with, ethylene, diamine, tetramethylene, phosphonate, edtmp, and, injected, intravenously, the, chelation, prevents, accumulation, of, radioactive, samarium, in, the, body, that, would, result, in, excessive, irradiation, and, generation, of, new, cancer, cells, the, corresponding, drug, has, several, names, including, samarium, 153, sm, lexidronam, its, trade, name, is, quadramet, detection, of, samarium, and, related, elements, was, announced, by, several, scientists, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, however, most, sources, give, priority, to, french, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, boisbaudran, isolated, samarium, oxide, and, or, hydroxide, in, paris, in, 1879, from, the, mineral, samarskite, y, ce, u, fe, 3, nb, ta, ti, 5, o, 16, and, identified, a, new, element, in, it, via, sharp, optical, absorption, lines, swiss, chemist, marc, delafontaine, announced, a, new, element, decipium, from, latin, decipiens, meaning, deceptive, misleading, in, 1878, but, later, in, 1880, 1881, demonstrated, that, it, was, a, mix, of, several, elements, one, being, identical, to, boisbaudran, s, samarium, though, samarskite, was, first, found, in, the, ural, mountains, in, russia, by, the, late, 1870s, it, had, been, found, in, other, places, making, it, available, to, many, researchers, in, particular, it, was, found, that, the, samarium, isolated, by, boisbaudran, was, also, impure, and, had, a, comparable, amount, of, europium, the, pure, element, was, produced, only, in, 1901, by, eug, ne, anatole, demar, ay, boisbaudran, named, his, element, samarium, after, the, mineral, samarskite, which, in, turn, honored, vassili, samarsky, bykhovets, 1803, 1870, samarsky, bykhovets, as, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, russian, corps, of, mining, engineers, had, granted, access, for, two, german, mineralogists, the, brothers, gustav, and, heinrich, rose, to, study, the, mineral, samples, from, the, urals, samarium, was, thus, the, first, chemical, element, to, be, named, after, a, person, the, word, samaria, is, sometimes, used, to, mean, samarium, iii, oxide, by, analogy, with, yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc, the, symbol, sm, was, suggested, for, samarium, but, an, alternative, sa, was, often, used, instead, until, the, 1920s, before, the, advent, of, ion, exchange, separation, technology, in, the, 1950s, pure, samarium, had, no, commercial, uses, however, a, by, product, of, fractional, crystallization, purification, of, neodymium, was, a, mix, of, samarium, and, gadolinium, that, got, the, name, lindsay, mix, after, the, company, that, made, it, and, was, used, for, nuclear, control, rods, in, some, early, nuclear, reactors, nowadays, a, similar, commodity, product, has, the, name, samarium, europium, gadolinium, seg, concentrate, it, is, prepared, by, solvent, extraction, from, the, mixed, lanthanides, isolated, from, bastn, site, or, monazite, since, heavier, lanthanides, have, more, affinity, for, the, solvent, used, they, are, easily, extracted, from, the, bulk, using, relatively, small, proportions, of, solvent, not, all, rare, earth, producers, who, process, bastn, site, do, so, on, a, large, enough, scale, to, continue, by, separating, the, components, of, seg, which, typically, makes, up, only, 1, 2, of, the, original, ore, such, producers, therefore, make, seg, with, a, view, to, marketing, it, to, the, specialized, processors, in, this, manner, the, valuable, europium, in, the, ore, is, rescued, for, use, in, making, phosphor, samarium, purification, follows, the, removal, of, the, europium, as, of, 2012, being, in, oversupply, samarium, oxide, is, cheaper, on, a, commercial, scale, than, its, relative, abundance, in, the, ore, might, suggest, samarium, concentration, in, soils, varies, between, 2, and, 23, ppm, and, oceans, contain, about, 0, 5, 0, 8, parts, per, trillion, the, median, value, for, its, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, used, by, the, crc, handbook, is, 7, parts, per, million, ppm, and, is, the, 40th, most, abundant, element, distribution, of, samarium, in, soils, strongly, depends, on, its, chemical, state, and, is, very, inhomogeneous, in, sandy, soils, samarium, concentration, is, about, 200, times, higher, at, the, surface, of, soil, particles, than, in, the, water, trapped, between, them, and, this, ratio, can, exceed, 1, 000, in, clays, samarium, is, not, found, free, in, nature, but, like, other, rare, earth, elements, is, contained, in, many, minerals, including, monazite, bastn, site, cerite, gadolinite, and, samarskite, monazite, in, which, samarium, occurs, at, concentrations, of, up, to, 2, 8, and, bastn, site, are, mostly, used, as, commercial, sources, world, resources, of, samarium, are, estimated, at, two, million, tonnes, they, are, mostly, located, in, china, us, brazil, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, and, the, annual, production, is, about, 700, tonnes, country, production, reports, are, usually, given, for, all, rare, earth, metals, combined, by, far, china, has, the, largest, production, with, 120, 000, tonnes, mined, per, year, it, is, followed, by, the, us, about, 5, 000, tonnes, and, india, 2, 700, tonnes, samarium, is, usually, sold, as, oxide, which, at, the, price, of, about, us, 30, kg, is, one, of, the, cheapest, lanthanide, oxides, whereas, mischmetal, a, mixture, of, rare, earth, metals, containing, about, 1, of, samarium, has, long, been, used, relatively, pure, samarium, has, been, isolated, only, recently, through, ion, exchange, processes, solvent, extraction, techniques, and, electrochemical, deposition, the, metal, is, often, prepared, by, electrolysis, of, a, molten, mixture, of, samarium, iii, chloride, with, sodium, chloride, or, calcium, chloride, samarium, can, also, be, obtained, by, reducing, its, oxide, with, lanthanum, the, product, is, then, distilled, to, separate, samarium, boiling, point, 1794, c, and, lanthanum, b, p, 3464, c, very, few, minerals, have, samarium, being, the, most, dominant, element, minerals, with, essential, dominant, samarium, include, monazite, sm, and, florencite, sm, these, minerals, are, very, rare, and, are, usually, found, containing, other, elements, usually, cerium, or, neodymium, it, is, also, made, by, neutron, capture, by, samarium, 149, which, is, added, to, the, control, rods, of, nuclear, reactors, therefore, 151, sm, is, present, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, and, radioactive, waste, an, important, use, of, samarium, is, samarium, cobalt, magnets, which, are, nominally, smco, 5, or, sm, 2, co, 17, they, have, high, permanent, magnetization, about, 10, 000, times, that, of, iron, and, second, only, to, neodymium, magnets, however, samarium, magnets, resist, demagnetization, better, they, are, stable, to, temperatures, above, 700, c, 1, 292, f, cf, 300, 400, c, for, neodymium, magnets, these, magnets, are, found, in, small, motors, headphones, and, high, end, magnetic, pickups, for, guitars, and, related, musical, instruments, for, example, they, are, used, in, the, motors, of, a, solar, powered, electric, aircraft, the, solar, challenger, and, in, the, samarium, cobalt, noiseless, electric, guitar, and, bass, pickups, samarium, and, its, compounds, are, important, as, catalysts, and, chemical, reagents, samarium, catalysts, help, the, decomposition, of, plastics, dechlorination, of, pollutants, such, as, polychlorinated, biphenyls, pcb, as, well, as, dehydration, and, dehydrogenation, of, ethanol, samarium, iii, triflate, sm, otf, 3, that, is, sm, cf, 3, so, 3, 3, is, one, of, the, most, efficient, lewis, acid, catalysts, for, a, halogen, promoted, friedel, crafts, reaction, with, alkenes, samarium, ii, iodide, is, a, very, common, reducing, and, coupling, agent, in, organic, synthesis, for, example, in, desulfonylation, reactions, annulation, danishefsky, kuwajima, mukaiyama, and, holton, taxol, total, syntheses, strychnine, total, synthesis, barbier, reaction, and, other, reductions, with, samarium, ii, iodide, in, its, usual, oxidized, form, samarium, is, added, to, ceramics, and, glasses, where, it, increases, absorption, of, infrared, light, as, a, minor, part, of, mischmetal, samarium, is, found, in, the, flint, ignition, devices, of, many, lighters, and, torches, samarium, 149, has, a, high, cross, section, for, neutron, capture, 41, 000, barns, and, so, is, used, in, control, rods, of, nuclear, reactors, its, advantage, compared, to, competing, materials, such, as, boron, and, cadmium, is, stability, of, absorption, most, of, the, fusion, products, of, 149, sm, are, other, isotopes, of, samarium, that, are, also, good, neutron, absorbers, for, example, the, cross, section, of, samarium, 151, is, 15, 000, barns, it, is, on, the, order, of, hundreds, of, barns, for, 150, sm, 152, sm, and, 153, sm, and, 6, 800, barns, for, natural, mixed, isotope, samarium, samarium, doped, calcium, fluoride, crystals, were, used, as, an, active, medium, in, one, of, the, first, solid, state, lasers, designed, and, built, by, peter, sorokin, co, inventor, of, the, dye, laser, and, mirek, stevenson, at, ibm, research, labs, in, early, 1961, this, samarium, laser, gave, pulses, of, red, light, at, 708, 5, nm, it, had, to, be, cooled, by, liquid, helium, and, so, did, not, find, practical, applications, another, samarium, based, laser, became, the, first, saturated, x, ray, laser, operating, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 10, nanometers, it, gave, 50, picosecond, pulses, at, 7, 3, and, 6, 8, nm, suitable, for, uses, in, holography, high, resolution, microscopy, of, biological, specimens, deflectometry, interferometry, and, radiography, of, dense, plasmas, related, to, confinement, fusion, and, astrophysics, saturated, operation, meant, that, the, maximum, possible, power, was, extracted, from, the, lasing, medium, resulting, in, the, high, peak, energy, of, 0, 3, mj, the, active, medium, was, samarium, plasma, produced, by, irradiating, samarium, coated, glass, with, a, pulsed, infrared, nd, glass, laser, wavelength, 1, 05, m, in, 2007, it, was, shown, that, nanocrystalline, bafcl, sm, 3, as, prepared, by, co, precipitation, can, serve, as, a, very, efficient, x, ray, storage, phosphor, the, co, precipitation, leads, to, nanocrystallites, of, the, order, of, 100, 200, nm, in, size, and, their, sensitivity, as, x, ray, storage, phosphors, is, increased, a, remarkable, 500, 000, times, because, of, the, specific, arrangements, and, density, of, defect, centers, in, comparison, with, microcrystalline, samples, prepared, by, sintering, at, high, temperature, the, mechanism, is, based, on, reduction, of, sm, 3, to, sm, 2, by, trapping, electrons, that, are, created, upon, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, in, the, bafcl, host, the, 5, d, j, 7, f, j, f, f, luminescence, lines, can, be, very, efficiently, excited, via, the, parity, allowed, 4f, 6, 4f, 5, 5d, transition, at, 417, nm, the, latter, wavelength, is, ideal, for, efficient, excitation, by, blue, violet, laser, diodes, as, the, transition, is, electric, dipole, allowed, and, thus, relatively, intense, 400, l, mol, cm, the, phosphor, has, potential, applications, in, personal, dosimetry, dosimetry, and, imaging, in, radiotherapy, and, medical, imaging, samarium, salts, stimulate, metabolism, but, it, is, unclear, whether, this, is, from, samarium, or, other, lanthanides, present, with, it, the, total, amount, of, samarium, in, adults, is, about, 50, g, mostly, in, liver, and, kidneys, and, with, 8, g, l, being, dissolved, in, blood, samarium, is, not, absorbed, by, plants, to, a, measurable, concentration, and, so, is, normally, not, part, of, human, diet, however, a, few, plants, and, vegetables, may, contain, up, to, 1, part, per, million, of, samarium, insoluble, salts, of, samarium, are, non, toxic, and, the, soluble, ones, are, only, slightly, toxic, when, ingested, only, 0, 05, of, samarium, salts, are, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, and, the, remainder, are, excreted, from, the, blood, 45, goes, to, the, liver, and, 45, is, deposited, on, the, surface, of, the, bones, where, it, remains, for, 10, years, the, remaining, 10, is, excreted
