a, circumpolar, vortex, or, simply, polar, vortex, is, a, large, region, of, cold, rotating, air, polar, vortices, encircle, both, of, earth, s, polar, regions, polar, vortices, also, exist, on, other, rotating, low, obliquity, planetary, bodies, the, term, polar, vortex, can, be, used, to, describe, two, distinct, phenomena, the, stratospheric, polar, vortex, and, the, tropospheric, polar, vortex, the, stratospheric, and, tropospheric, polar, vortices, both, rotate, in, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, spin, but, they, are, distinct, phenomena, that, have, different, sizes, structures, seasonal, cycles, and, impacts, on, weather, the, stratospheric, polar, vortex, is, an, area, of, high, speed, cyclonically, rotating, winds, around, 15, km, to, 50, km, high, poleward, of, 50, and, is, strongest, in, winter, it, forms, during, autumn, when, arctic, or, antarctic, temperatures, cool, rapidly, as, the, polar, night, begins, the, increased, temperature, difference, between, the, pole, and, the, tropics, causes, strong, winds, and, the, coriolis, effect, causes, the, vortex, to, spin, up, the, stratospheric, polar, vortex, breaks, down, during, spring, as, the, polar, night, ends, a, sudden, stratospheric, warming, ssw, is, an, event, that, occurs, when, the, stratospheric, vortex, breaks, down, during, winter, and, can, have, significant, impacts, on, surface, weather, the, tropospheric, polar, vortex, is, often, defined, as, the, area, poleward, of, the, tropospheric, jet, stream, the, equatorward, edge, is, around, 40, to, 50, and, it, extends, from, the, surface, up, to, around, 10, km, to, 15, km, its, yearly, cycle, differs, from, the, stratospheric, vortex, because, the, tropospheric, vortex, exists, all, year, but, is, similar, to, the, stratospheric, vortex, since, it, is, also, strongest, in, winter, when, the, polar, regions, are, coldest, the, tropospheric, polar, vortex, was, first, described, as, early, as, 1853, the, stratospheric, vortex, s, ssws, were, discovered, in, 1952, with, radiosonde, observations, at, altitudes, higher, than, 20, km, the, tropospheric, polar, vortex, was, mentioned, frequently, in, the, news, and, weather, media, in, the, cold, north, american, winter, of, 2013, 2014, popularizing, the, term, as, an, explanation, of, very, cold, temperatures, the, tropospheric, vortex, increased, in, public, visibility, in, 2021, as, a, result, of, extreme, frigid, temperatures, in, the, central, united, states, with, experts, linking, its, effects, to, climate, change, ozone, depletion, occurs, most, heavily, within, the, polar, vortices, particularly, over, the, southern, hemisphere, reaching, a, maximum, depletion, in, the, spring, when, the, tropospheric, vortex, of, the, arctic, is, strong, it, has, a, well, defined, and, nearly, circular, shape, there, is, a, single, vortex, with, a, jet, stream, that, is, well, constrained, near, the, polar, front, and, the, arctic, air, is, well, contained, when, this, northern, tropospheric, vortex, weakens, it, breaks, into, two, or, more, smaller, vortices, the, strongest, of, which, are, near, baffin, island, nunavut, and, the, others, over, northeast, siberia, when, it, is, very, weak, the, flow, of, arctic, air, becomes, more, disorganized, and, masses, of, cold, arctic, air, can, push, equatorward, bringing, with, them, a, rapid, and, sharp, temperature, drop, a, deep, freeze, that, gripped, much, of, the, united, states, and, canada, in, late, january, 2019, has, been, blamed, on, a, polar, vortex, this, is, not, the, scientifically, correct, use, of, the, term, polar, vortex, but, instead, is, referring, to, outbreaks, of, cold, arctic, air, caused, by, a, weakened, polar, vortex, the, us, national, weather, service, warned, that, frostbite, is, possible, within, just, 10, minutes, of, being, outside, in, such, extreme, temperatures, and, hundreds, of, schools, colleges, and, universities, in, the, affected, areas, were, closed, around, 21, people, died, in, us, due, to, severe, frostbite, states, within, the, midwest, region, of, the, united, states, had, windchills, just, above, 50, f, 45, c, the, polar, vortex, is, also, thought, to, have, had, effects, in, europe, for, example, the, 2013, 14, united, kingdom, winter, floods, were, blamed, on, the, polar, vortex, bringing, severe, cold, in, the, united, states, and, canada, similarly, the, severe, cold, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, winters, of, 2009, 10, and, 2010, 11, were, also, blamed, on, the, polar, vortex, the, antarctic, vortex, of, the, southern, hemisphere, is, a, single, low, pressure, zone, that, is, found, near, the, edge, of, the, ross, ice, shelf, near, 160, west, longitude, when, the, polar, vortex, is, strong, the, mid, latitude, westerlies, winds, at, the, surface, level, between, 30, and, 60, latitude, from, the, west, increase, in, strength, and, are, persistent, when, the, polar, vortex, is, weak, high, pressure, zones, of, the, mid, latitudes, may, push, poleward, moving, the, polar, vortex, jet, stream, and, polar, front, equatorward, the, jet, stream, is, seen, to, buckle, and, deviate, south, this, rapidly, brings, cold, dry, air, into, contact, with, the, warm, moist, air, of, the, mid, latitudes, resulting, in, a, rapid, and, dramatic, change, of, weather, known, as, a, cold, snap, in, australia, the, polar, vortex, known, there, as, a, polar, blast, or, polar, plunge, is, a, cold, front, that, drags, air, from, antarctica, which, brings, rain, showers, snow, typically, inland, with, blizzards, occurring, in, the, highlands, gusty, icy, winds, and, hail, in, the, south, eastern, parts, of, the, country, such, as, in, victoria, tasmania, the, southeast, coast, of, south, australia, and, the, southern, half, of, new, south, wales, but, only, on, the, windward, side, of, the, great, dividing, range, whereas, the, leeward, side, will, be, affected, by, foehn, winds, the, bases, of, the, two, polar, vortices, are, located, in, the, middle, and, upper, troposphere, and, extend, into, the, stratosphere, beneath, that, lies, a, large, mass, of, cold, dense, arctic, air, the, interface, between, the, cold, dry, air, mass, of, the, pole, and, the, warm, moist, air, mass, farther, south, defines, the, location, of, the, polar, front, the, polar, front, is, centered, roughly, at, 60, latitude, a, polar, vortex, strengthens, in, the, winter, and, weakens, in, the, summer, because, of, its, dependence, on, the, temperature, difference, between, the, equator, and, the, poles, polar, cyclones, are, low, pressure, zones, embedded, within, the, polar, air, masses, and, exist, year, round, the, stratospheric, polar, vortex, develops, at, latitudes, above, the, subtropical, jet, stream, horizontally, most, polar, vortices, have, a, radius, of, less, than, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, since, polar, vortices, exist, from, the, stratosphere, downward, into, the, mid, troposphere, a, variety, of, heights, pressure, levels, are, used, to, mark, its, position, the, 50, hpa, pressure, surface, is, most, often, used, to, identify, its, stratospheric, location, at, the, level, of, the, tropopause, the, extent, of, closed, contours, of, potential, temperature, can, be, used, to, determine, its, strength, others, have, used, levels, down, to, the, 500, hpa, pressure, level, about, 5, 460, metres, 17, 910, ft, above, sea, level, during, the, winter, to, identify, the, polar, vortex, polar, vortices, are, weakest, during, summer, and, strongest, during, winter, extratropical, cyclones, that, migrate, into, higher, latitudes, when, the, polar, vortex, is, weak, can, disrupt, the, single, vortex, creating, smaller, vortices, cold, core, lows, within, the, polar, air, mass, those, individual, vortices, can, persist, for, more, than, a, month, volcanic, eruptions, in, the, tropics, can, lead, to, a, stronger, polar, vortex, during, winter, for, as, long, as, two, years, afterwards, the, strength, and, position, of, the, polar, vortex, shapes, the, flow, pattern, in, a, broad, area, about, it, an, index, which, is, used, in, the, northern, hemisphere, to, gauge, its, magnitude, is, the, arctic, oscillation, when, the, arctic, vortex, is, at, its, strongest, there, is, a, single, vortex, but, normally, the, arctic, vortex, is, elongated, in, shape, with, two, cyclone, centers, one, over, baffin, island, in, canada, and, the, other, over, northeast, siberia, when, the, arctic, pattern, is, at, its, weakest, subtropic, air, masses, can, intrude, poleward, causing, the, arctic, air, masses, to, move, equatorward, as, during, the, winter, 1985, arctic, outbreak, the, antarctic, polar, vortex, is, more, pronounced, and, persistent, than, the, arctic, one, in, the, arctic, the, distribution, of, land, masses, at, high, latitudes, in, the, northern, hemisphere, gives, rise, to, rossby, waves, which, contribute, to, the, breakdown, of, the, polar, vortex, whereas, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, vortex, is, less, disturbed, the, breakdown, of, the, polar, vortex, is, an, extreme, event, known, as, a, sudden, stratospheric, warming, here, the, vortex, completely, breaks, down, and, an, associated, warming, of, 30, 50, c, 54, 90, f, over, a, few, days, can, occur, the, waxing, and, waning, of, the, polar, vortex, is, driven, by, the, movement, of, mass, and, the, transfer, of, heat, in, the, polar, region, in, the, autumn, the, circumpolar, winds, increase, in, speed, and, the, polar, vortex, rises, into, the, stratosphere, the, result, is, that, the, polar, air, forms, a, coherent, rotating, air, mass, the, polar, vortex, as, winter, approaches, the, vortex, core, cools, the, winds, decrease, and, the, vortex, energy, declines, once, late, winter, and, early, spring, approach, the, vortex, is, at, its, weakest, as, a, result, during, late, winter, large, fragments, of, the, vortex, air, can, be, diverted, into, lower, latitudes, by, stronger, weather, systems, intruding, from, those, latitudes, in, the, lowest, level, of, the, stratosphere, strong, potential, vorticity, gradients, remain, and, the, majority, of, that, air, remains, confined, within, the, polar, air, mass, into, december, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, april, in, the, northern, hemisphere, well, after, the, breakup, of, the, vortex, in, the, mid, stratosphere, the, breakup, of, the, northern, polar, vortex, occurs, between, mid, march, to, mid, may, this, event, signifies, the, transition, from, winter, to, spring, and, has, impacts, on, the, hydrological, cycle, growing, seasons, of, vegetation, and, overall, ecosystem, productivity, the, timing, of, the, transition, also, influences, changes, in, sea, ice, ozone, air, temperature, and, cloudiness, early, and, late, polar, breakup, episodes, have, occurred, due, to, variations, in, the, stratospheric, flow, structure, and, upward, spreading, of, planetary, waves, from, the, troposphere, as, a, result, of, increased, waves, into, the, vortex, the, vortex, experiences, more, rapid, warming, than, normal, resulting, in, an, earlier, breakup, and, spring, when, the, breakup, comes, early, it, is, characterized, by, with, persistent, of, remnants, of, the, vortex, when, the, breakup, is, late, the, remnants, dissipate, rapidly, when, the, breakup, is, early, there, is, one, warming, period, from, late, february, to, middle, march, when, the, breakup, is, late, there, are, two, warming, periods, one, january, and, one, in, march, zonal, mean, temperature, wind, and, geopotential, height, exert, varying, deviations, from, their, normal, values, before, and, after, early, breakups, while, the, deviations, remain, constant, before, and, after, late, breakups, scientists, are, connecting, a, delay, in, the, arctic, vortex, breakup, with, a, reduction, of, planetary, wave, activities, few, stratospheric, sudden, warming, events, and, depletion, of, ozone, sudden, stratospheric, warming, events, are, associated, with, weaker, polar, vortices, this, warming, of, stratospheric, air, can, reverse, the, circulation, in, the, arctic, polar, vortex, from, counter, clockwise, to, clockwise, these, changes, aloft, force, changes, in, the, troposphere, below, an, example, of, an, effect, on, the, troposphere, is, the, change, in, speed, of, the, atlantic, ocean, circulation, pattern, a, soft, spot, just, south, of, greenland, is, where, the, initial, step, of, downwelling, occurs, nicknamed, the, achilles, heel, of, the, north, atlantic, small, amounts, of, heating, or, cooling, traveling, from, the, polar, vortex, can, trigger, or, delay, downwelling, altering, the, gulf, stream, current, of, the, atlantic, and, the, speed, of, other, ocean, currents, since, all, other, oceans, depend, on, the, atlantic, ocean, s, movement, of, heat, energy, climates, across, the, planet, can, be, dramatically, affected, the, weakening, or, strengthening, of, the, polar, vortex, can, alter, the, sea, circulation, more, than, a, mile, beneath, the, waves, strengthening, storm, systems, within, the, troposphere, that, cool, the, poles, intensify, the, polar, vortex, la, ni, a, related, climate, anomalies, significantly, strengthen, the, polar, vortex, intensification, of, the, polar, vortex, produces, changes, in, relative, humidity, as, downward, intrusions, of, dry, stratospheric, air, enter, the, vortex, core, with, a, strengthening, of, the, vortex, comes, a, longwave, cooling, due, to, a, decrease, in, water, vapor, concentration, near, the, vortex, the, decreased, water, content, is, a, result, of, a, lower, tropopause, within, the, vortex, which, places, dry, stratospheric, air, above, moist, tropospheric, air, instability, is, caused, when, the, vortex, tube, the, line, of, concentrated, vorticity, is, displaced, when, this, occurs, the, vortex, rings, become, more, unstable, and, prone, to, shifting, by, planetary, waves, the, planetary, wave, activity, in, both, hemispheres, varies, year, to, year, producing, a, corresponding, response, in, the, strength, and, temperature, of, the, polar, vortex, the, number, of, waves, around, the, perimeter, of, the, vortex, are, related, to, the, core, size, as, the, vortex, core, decreases, the, number, of, waves, increase, the, degree, of, the, mixing, of, polar, and, mid, latitude, air, depends, on, the, evolution, and, position, of, the, polar, night, jet, in, general, the, mixing, is, less, inside, the, vortex, than, outside, mixing, occurs, with, unstable, planetary, waves, that, are, characteristic, of, the, middle, and, upper, stratosphere, in, winter, prior, to, vortex, breakdown, there, is, little, transport, of, air, out, of, the, arctic, polar, vortex, due, to, strong, barriers, above, 420, km, 261, miles, the, polar, night, jet, which, exists, below, this, is, weak, in, the, early, winter, as, a, result, it, does, not, deviate, any, descending, polar, air, which, then, mixes, with, air, in, the, mid, latitudes, in, the, late, winter, air, parcels, do, not, descend, as, much, reducing, mixing, after, the, vortex, is, broken, up, the, ex, vortex, air, is, dispersed, into, the, middle, latitudes, within, a, month, sometimes, a, mass, of, the, polar, vortex, breaks, off, before, the, end, of, the, final, warming, period, if, large, enough, the, piece, can, move, into, canada, and, the, midwestern, central, southern, and, northeastern, united, states, this, diversion, of, the, polar, vortex, can, occur, due, to, the, displacement, of, the, polar, jet, stream, for, example, the, significant, northwestward, direction, of, the, polar, jet, stream, in, the, western, part, of, the, united, states, during, the, winters, of, 2013, 2014, and, 2014, 2015, this, caused, warm, dry, conditions, in, the, west, and, cold, snowy, conditions, in, the, north, central, and, northeast, occasionally, the, high, pressure, air, mass, called, the, greenland, block, can, cause, the, polar, vortex, to, divert, to, the, south, rather, than, follow, its, normal, path, over, the, north, atlantic, a, study, in, 2001, found, that, stratospheric, circulation, can, have, anomalous, effects, on, weather, regimes, in, the, same, year, researchers, found, a, statistical, correlation, between, weak, polar, vortex, and, outbreaks, of, severe, cold, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, later, years, scientists, identified, interactions, with, arctic, sea, ice, decline, reduced, snow, cover, evapotranspiration, patterns, nao, anomalies, or, weather, anomalies, which, are, linked, to, the, polar, vortex, and, jet, stream, configuration, since, the, early, 2000s, climate, models, have, consistently, identified, that, global, warming, will, gradually, push, jet, streams, poleward, in, 2008, this, was, confirmed, by, observational, evidence, which, proved, that, from, 1979, to, 2001, the, northern, jet, stream, moved, northward, at, an, average, rate, of, 2, 01, kilometres, 1, 25, mi, per, year, with, a, similar, trend, in, the, southern, hemisphere, jet, stream, climate, scientists, have, hypothesized, that, the, jet, stream, will, also, gradually, weaken, as, a, result, of, global, warming, trends, such, as, arctic, sea, ice, decline, reduced, snow, cover, evapotranspiration, patterns, and, other, weather, anomalies, have, caused, the, arctic, to, heat, up, faster, than, other, parts, of, the, globe, in, what, is, known, as, the, arctic, amplification, in, 2021, 2022, it, was, found, that, since, 1979, the, warming, within, the, arctic, circle, has, been, nearly, four, times, faster, than, the, global, average, and, some, hotspots, in, the, barents, sea, area, warmed, up, to, seven, times, faster, than, the, global, average, while, the, arctic, remains, one, of, the, coldest, places, on, earth, today, the, temperature, gradient, between, it, and, the, warmer, parts, of, the, globe, will, continue, to, diminish, with, every, decade, of, global, warming, as, the, result, of, this, amplification, if, this, gradient, has, a, strong, influence, on, the, jet, stream, then, it, will, eventually, become, weaker, and, more, variable, in, its, course, which, would, allow, more, cold, air, from, the, polar, vortex, to, leak, mid, latitudes, and, slow, the, progression, of, rossby, waves, leading, to, more, persistent, and, more, extreme, weather, the, hypothesis, above, is, closely, associated, with, jennifer, francis, who, had, first, proposed, it, in, a, 2012, paper, co, authored, by, stephen, j, vavrus, while, some, paleoclimate, reconstructions, have, suggested, that, the, polar, vortex, becomes, more, variable, and, causes, more, unstable, weather, during, periods, of, warming, back, in, 1997, this, was, contradicted, by, climate, modelling, with, pmip2, simulations, finding, in, 2010, that, the, arctic, oscillation, was, much, weaker, and, more, negative, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, and, suggesting, that, warmer, periods, have, stronger, positive, phase, ao, and, thus, less, frequent, leaks, of, the, polar, vortex, air, however, a, 2012, review, in, the, journal, of, the, atmospheric, sciences, noted, that, there, a, significant, change, in, the, vortex, mean, state, over, the, twenty, first, century, resulting, in, a, weaker, more, disturbed, vortex, which, contradicted, the, modelling, results, but, fit, the, francis, vavrus, hypothesis, additionally, a, 2013, study, noted, that, the, then, current, cmip5, tended, to, strongly, underestimate, winter, blocking, trends, and, other, 2012, research, had, suggested, a, connection, between, declining, arctic, sea, ice, and, heavy, snowfall, during, midlatitude, winters, in, 2013, further, research, from, francis, connected, reductions, in, the, arctic, sea, ice, to, extreme, summer, weather, in, the, northern, mid, latitudes, while, other, research, from, that, year, identified, potential, linkages, between, arctic, sea, ice, trends, and, more, extreme, rainfall, in, the, european, summer, at, the, time, it, was, also, suggested, that, this, connection, between, arctic, amplification, and, jet, stream, patterns, was, involved, in, the, formation, of, hurricane, sandy, and, played, a, role, in, the, early, 2014, north, american, cold, wave, in, 2015, francis, next, study, concluded, that, highly, amplified, jet, stream, patterns, are, occurring, more, frequently, in, the, past, two, decades, hence, continued, heat, trapping, emissions, favour, increased, formation, of, extreme, events, caused, by, prolonged, weather, conditions, studies, published, in, 2017, and, 2018, identified, stalling, patterns, of, rossby, waves, in, the, northern, hemisphere, jet, stream, as, the, culprit, behind, other, almost, stationary, extreme, weather, events, such, as, the, 2018, european, heatwave, the, 2003, european, heat, wave, 2010, russian, heat, wave, or, the, 2010, pakistan, floods, and, suggested, that, these, patterns, were, all, connected, to, arctic, amplification, further, work, from, francis, and, vavrus, that, year, suggested, that, amplified, arctic, warming, is, observed, as, stronger, in, lower, atmospheric, areas, because, the, expanding, process, of, warmer, air, increases, pressure, levels, which, decreases, poleward, geopotential, height, gradients, as, these, gradients, are, the, reason, that, cause, west, to, east, winds, through, the, thermal, wind, relationship, declining, speeds, are, usually, found, south, of, the, areas, with, geopotential, increases, in, 2017, francis, explained, her, findings, to, the, scientific, american, a, lot, more, water, vapor, is, being, transported, northward, by, big, swings, in, the, jet, stream, that, s, important, because, water, vapor, is, a, greenhouse, gas, just, like, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, it, traps, heat, in, the, atmosphere, that, vapor, also, condenses, as, droplets, we, know, as, clouds, which, themselves, trap, more, heat, the, vapor, is, a, big, part, of, the, amplification, story, a, big, reason, the, arctic, is, warming, faster, than, anywhere, else, in, a, 2017, study, conducted, by, climatologist, judah, cohen, and, several, of, his, research, associates, cohen, wrote, that, shift, in, polar, vortex, states, can, account, for, most, of, the, recent, winter, cooling, trends, over, eurasian, midlatitudes, a, 2018, paper, from, vavrus, and, others, linked, arctic, amplification, to, more, persistent, hot, dry, extremes, during, the, midlatitude, summers, as, well, as, the, midlatitude, winter, continental, cooling, another, 2017, paper, estimated, that, when, the, arctic, experiences, anomalous, warming, primary, production, in, north, america, goes, down, by, between, 1, and, 4, on, average, with, some, states, suffering, up, to, 20, losses, a, 2021, study, found, that, a, stratospheric, polar, vortex, disruption, is, linked, with, extreme, cold, winter, weather, across, parts, of, asia, and, north, america, including, the, february, 2021, north, american, cold, wave, another, 2021, study, identified, a, connection, between, the, arctic, sea, ice, loss, and, the, increased, size, of, wildfires, in, the, western, united, states, however, because, the, specific, observations, are, considered, short, term, observations, there, is, considerable, uncertainty, in, the, conclusions, climatology, observations, require, several, decades, to, definitively, distinguish, various, forms, of, natural, variability, from, climate, trends, this, point, was, stressed, by, reviews, in, 2013, and, in, 2017, a, study, in, 2014, concluded, that, arctic, amplification, significantly, decreased, cold, season, temperature, variability, over, the, northern, hemisphere, in, recent, decades, cold, arctic, air, intrudes, into, the, warmer, lower, latitudes, more, rapidly, today, during, autumn, and, winter, a, trend, projected, to, continue, in, the, future, except, during, summer, thus, calling, into, question, whether, winters, will, bring, more, cold, extremes, a, 2019, analysis, of, a, data, set, collected, from, 35, 182, weather, stations, worldwide, including, 9116, whose, records, go, beyond, 50, years, found, a, sharp, decrease, in, northern, midlatitude, cold, waves, since, the, 1980s, moreover, a, range, of, long, term, observational, data, collected, during, the, 2010s, and, published, in, 2020, suggests, that, the, intensification, of, arctic, amplification, since, the, early, 2010s, was, not, linked, to, significant, changes, on, mid, latitude, atmospheric, patterns, state, of, the, art, modelling, research, of, pamip, polar, amplification, model, intercomparison, project, improved, upon, the, 2010, findings, of, pmip2, it, found, that, sea, ice, decline, would, weaken, the, jet, stream, and, increase, the, probability, of, atmospheric, blocking, but, the, connection, was, very, minor, and, typically, insignificant, next, to, interannual, variability, in, 2022, a, follow, up, study, found, that, while, the, pamip, average, had, likely, underestimated, the, weakening, caused, by, sea, ice, decline, by, 1, 2, to, 3, times, even, the, corrected, connection, still, amounts, to, only, 10, of, the, jet, stream, s, natural, variability, the, chemistry, of, the, antarctic, polar, vortex, has, created, severe, ozone, depletion, although, the, effect, has, been, weakening, since, the, 2000s, it, is, expected, to, return, to, 1980, levels, in, about, 2075, the, nitric, acid, in, polar, stratospheric, clouds, reacts, with, chlorofluorocarbons, to, form, chlorine, which, catalyzes, the, photochemical, destruction, of, ozone, chlorine, concentrations, build, up, during, the, polar, winter, and, the, consequent, ozone, destruction, is, greatest, when, the, sunlight,
