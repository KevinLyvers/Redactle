in, astronomy, coordinate, systems, are, used, for, specifying, positions, of, celestial, objects, satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, etc, relative, to, a, given, reference, frame, based, on, physical, reference, points, available, to, a, situated, observer, e, g, the, true, horizon, and, north, to, an, observer, on, earth, s, surface, coordinate, systems, in, astronomy, can, specify, an, object, s, relative, position, in, three, dimensional, space, or, plot, merely, by, its, direction, on, a, celestial, sphere, if, the, object, s, distance, is, unknown, or, trivial, spherical, coordinates, projected, on, the, celestial, sphere, are, analogous, to, the, geographic, coordinate, system, used, on, the, surface, of, earth, these, differ, in, their, choice, of, fundamental, plane, which, divides, the, celestial, sphere, into, two, equal, hemispheres, along, a, great, circle, rectangular, coordinates, in, appropriate, units, have, the, same, fundamental, x, y, plane, and, primary, x, axis, direction, such, as, an, axis, of, rotation, each, coordinate, system, is, named, after, its, choice, of, fundamental, plane, the, following, table, lists, the, common, coordinate, systems, in, use, by, the, astronomical, community, the, fundamental, plane, divides, the, celestial, sphere, into, two, equal, hemispheres, and, defines, the, baseline, for, the, latitudinal, coordinates, similar, to, the, equator, in, the, geographic, coordinate, system, the, poles, are, located, at, 90, from, the, fundamental, plane, the, primary, direction, is, the, starting, point, of, the, longitudinal, coordinates, the, origin, is, the, zero, distance, point, the, center, of, the, celestial, sphere, although, the, definition, of, celestial, sphere, is, ambiguous, about, the, definition, of, its, center, point, the, horizontal, or, altitude, azimuth, system, is, based, on, the, position, of, the, observer, on, earth, which, revolves, around, its, own, axis, once, per, sidereal, day, 23, hours, 56, minutes, and, 4, 091, seconds, in, relation, to, the, star, background, the, positioning, of, a, celestial, object, by, the, horizontal, system, varies, with, time, but, is, a, useful, coordinate, system, for, locating, and, tracking, objects, for, observers, on, earth, it, is, based, on, the, position, of, stars, relative, to, an, observer, s, ideal, horizon, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, is, centered, at, earth, s, center, but, fixed, relative, to, the, celestial, poles, and, the, march, equinox, the, coordinates, are, based, on, the, location, of, stars, relative, to, earth, s, equator, if, it, were, projected, out, to, an, infinite, distance, the, equatorial, describes, the, sky, as, seen, from, the, solar, system, and, modern, star, maps, almost, exclusively, use, equatorial, coordinates, the, equatorial, system, is, the, normal, coordinate, system, for, most, professional, and, many, amateur, astronomers, having, an, equatorial, mount, that, follows, the, movement, of, the, sky, during, the, night, celestial, objects, are, found, by, adjusting, the, telescope, s, or, other, instrument, s, scales, so, that, they, match, the, equatorial, coordinates, of, the, selected, object, to, observe, popular, choices, of, pole, and, equator, are, the, older, b1950, and, the, modern, j2000, systems, but, a, pole, and, equator, of, date, can, also, be, used, meaning, one, appropriate, to, the, date, under, consideration, such, as, when, a, measurement, of, the, position, of, a, planet, or, spacecraft, is, made, there, are, also, subdivisions, into, mean, of, date, coordinates, which, average, out, or, ignore, nutation, and, true, of, date, which, include, nutation, the, fundamental, plane, is, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, orbit, called, the, ecliptic, plane, there, are, two, principal, variants, of, the, ecliptic, coordinate, system, geocentric, ecliptic, coordinates, centered, on, the, earth, and, heliocentric, ecliptic, coordinates, centered, on, the, center, of, mass, of, the, solar, system, the, geocentric, ecliptic, system, was, the, principal, coordinate, system, for, ancient, astronomy, and, is, still, useful, for, computing, the, apparent, motions, of, the, sun, moon, and, planets, it, was, used, to, define, the, twelve, astrological, signs, of, the, zodiac, for, instance, the, heliocentric, ecliptic, system, describes, the, planets, orbital, movement, around, the, sun, and, centers, on, the, barycenter, of, the, solar, system, i, e, very, close, to, the, center, of, the, sun, the, system, is, primarily, used, for, computing, the, positions, of, planets, and, other, solar, system, bodies, as, well, as, defining, their, orbital, elements, the, galactic, coordinate, system, uses, the, approximate, plane, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, as, its, fundamental, plane, the, solar, system, is, still, the, center, of, the, coordinate, system, and, the, zero, point, is, defined, as, the, direction, towards, the, galactic, center, galactic, latitude, resembles, the, elevation, above, the, galactic, plane, and, galactic, longitude, determines, direction, relative, to, the, center, of, the, galaxy, the, supergalactic, coordinate, system, corresponds, to, a, fundamental, plane, that, contains, a, higher, than, average, number, of, local, galaxies, in, the, sky, as, seen, from, earth, conversions, between, the, various, coordinate, systems, are, given, see, the, notes, before, using, these, equations, the, classical, equations, derived, from, spherical, trigonometry, for, the, longitudinal, coordinate, are, presented, to, the, right, of, a, bracket, dividing, the, first, equation, by, the, second, gives, the, convenient, tangent, equation, seen, on, the, left, the, rotation, matrix, equivalent, is, given, beneath, each, case, this, division, is, ambiguous, because, tan, has, a, period, of, 180, whereas, cos, and, sin, have, periods, of, 360, 2, azimuth, a, is, measured, from, the, south, point, turning, positive, to, the, west, zenith, distance, the, angular, distance, along, the, great, circle, from, the, zenith, to, a, celestial, object, is, simply, the, complementary, angle, of, the, altitude, 90, a, in, solving, the, tan, a, equation, for, a, in, order, to, avoid, the, ambiguity, of, the, arctangent, use, of, the, two, argument, arctangent, denoted, arctan, x, y, is, recommended, the, two, argument, arctangent, computes, the, arctangent, of, y, x, and, accounts, for, the, quadrant, in, which, it, is, being, computed, thus, consistent, with, the, convention, of, azimuth, being, measured, from, the, south, and, opening, positive, to, the, west, where, if, the, above, formula, produces, a, negative, value, for, a, it, can, be, rendered, positive, by, simply, adding, 360, again, in, solving, the, tan, h, equation, for, h, use, of, the, two, argument, arctangent, that, accounts, for, the, quadrant, is, recommended, thus, again, consistent, with, the, convention, of, azimuth, being, measured, from, the, south, and, opening, positive, to, the, west, where, these, equations, are, for, converting, equatorial, coordinates, to, galactic, coordinates, g, g, displaystyle, alpha, text, g, delta, text, g, are, the, equatorial, coordinates, of, the, north, galactic, pole, and, l, ncp, displaystyle, l, text, ncp, is, the, galactic, longitude, of, the, north, celestial, pole, referred, to, j2000, 0, the, values, of, these, quantities, are, if, the, equatorial, coordinates, are, referred, to, another, equinox, they, must, be, precessed, to, their, place, at, j2000, 0, before, applying, these, formulae, these, equations, convert, to, equatorial, coordinates, referred, to, b2000, 0
