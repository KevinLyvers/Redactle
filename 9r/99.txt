europa, j, r, o, p, or, jupiter, ii, is, the, smallest, of, the, four, galilean, moons, orbiting, jupiter, and, the, sixth, closest, to, the, planet, of, all, the, 95, known, moons, of, jupiter, it, is, also, the, sixth, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, europa, was, discovered, independently, by, simon, marius, and, galileo, galilei, and, was, named, by, marius, after, europa, the, phoenician, mother, of, king, minos, of, crete, and, lover, of, zeus, the, greek, equivalent, of, the, roman, god, jupiter, slightly, smaller, than, earth, s, moon, europa, is, made, of, silicate, rock, and, has, a, water, ice, crust, and, probably, an, iron, nickel, core, it, has, a, very, thin, atmosphere, composed, primarily, of, oxygen, its, geologically, young, white, beige, surface, is, striated, by, light, tan, cracks, and, streaks, with, very, few, impact, craters, in, addition, to, earth, bound, telescope, observations, europa, has, been, examined, by, a, succession, of, space, probe, flybys, the, first, occurring, in, the, early, 1970s, in, september, 2022, the, juno, spacecraft, flew, within, about, 320, km, 200, miles, of, europa, for, a, more, recent, close, up, view, europa, has, the, smoothest, surface, of, any, known, solid, object, in, the, solar, system, the, apparent, youth, and, smoothness, of, the, surface, is, due, to, a, water, ocean, beneath, the, surface, which, could, conceivably, harbor, extraterrestrial, life, although, it, would, most, likely, be, that, of, single, celled, organisms, and, bacteria, like, creatures, the, predominant, model, suggests, that, heat, from, tidal, flexing, causes, the, ocean, to, remain, liquid, and, drives, ice, movement, similar, to, plate, tectonics, absorbing, chemicals, from, the, surface, into, the, ocean, below, sea, salt, from, a, subsurface, ocean, may, be, coating, some, geological, features, on, europa, suggesting, that, the, ocean, is, interacting, with, the, sea, floor, this, may, be, important, in, determining, whether, europa, could, be, habitable, in, addition, the, hubble, space, telescope, detected, water, vapor, plumes, similar, to, those, observed, on, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, which, are, thought, to, be, caused, by, erupting, cryogeysers, in, may, 2018, astronomers, provided, supporting, evidence, of, water, plume, activity, on, europa, based, on, an, updated, analysis, of, data, obtained, from, the, galileo, space, probe, which, orbited, jupiter, from, 1995, to, 2003, such, plume, activity, could, help, researchers, in, a, search, for, life, from, the, subsurface, europan, ocean, without, having, to, land, on, the, moon, in, march, 2024, astronomers, reported, that, the, surface, of, europa, may, have, much, less, oxygen, than, previously, inferred, the, galileo, mission, launched, in, 1989, provides, the, bulk, of, current, data, on, europa, no, spacecraft, has, yet, landed, on, europa, although, there, have, been, several, proposed, exploration, missions, the, european, space, agency, s, jupiter, icy, moon, explorer, juice, is, a, mission, to, ganymede, launched, on, 14, april, 2023, that, will, include, two, flybys, of, europa, nasa, s, europa, clipper, is, expected, to, be, launched, in, october, 2024, with, a, complementary, lander, possible, based, on, its, findings, europa, along, with, jupiter, s, three, other, large, moons, io, ganymede, and, callisto, was, discovered, by, galileo, galilei, on, 8, january, 1610, and, possibly, independently, by, simon, marius, on, 7, january, galileo, had, observed, io, and, europa, together, using, a, 20, magnification, refracting, telescope, at, the, university, of, padua, but, the, low, resolution, could, not, separate, the, two, objects, the, following, night, he, saw, io, and, europa, for, the, first, time, as, separate, bodies, the, moon, is, the, namesake, of, europa, in, greek, mythology, the, daughter, of, the, phoenician, king, of, tyre, like, all, the, galilean, satellites, europa, is, named, after, a, lover, of, zeus, the, greek, counterpart, of, jupiter, europa, was, courted, by, zeus, and, became, the, queen, of, crete, the, naming, scheme, was, suggested, by, simon, marius, who, attributed, the, proposal, to, johannes, kepler, jupiter, is, much, blamed, by, the, poets, on, account, of, his, irregular, loves, three, maidens, are, especially, mentioned, as, having, been, clandestinely, courted, by, jupiter, with, success, io, daughter, of, the, river, inachus, callisto, of, lycaon, europa, of, agenor, then, there, was, ganymede, the, handsome, son, of, king, tros, whom, jupiter, having, taken, the, form, of, an, eagle, transported, to, heaven, on, his, back, as, poets, fabulously, tell, i, think, therefore, that, i, shall, not, have, done, amiss, if, the, first, is, called, by, me, io, the, second, europa, the, third, on, account, of, its, majesty, of, light, ganymede, the, fourth, callisto, the, names, fell, out, of, favor, for, a, considerable, time, and, were, not, revived, in, general, use, until, the, mid, 20th, century, in, much, of, the, earlier, astronomical, literature, europa, is, simply, referred, to, by, its, roman, numeral, designation, as, jupiter, ii, a, system, also, introduced, by, galileo, or, as, the, second, satellite, of, jupiter, in, 1892, the, discovery, of, amalthea, whose, orbit, lay, closer, to, jupiter, than, those, of, the, galilean, moons, pushed, europa, to, the, third, position, the, voyager, probes, discovered, three, more, inner, satellites, in, 1979, so, europa, is, now, counted, as, jupiter, s, sixth, satellite, though, it, is, still, referred, to, as, jupiter, ii, the, adjectival, form, has, stabilized, as, europan, europa, orbits, jupiter, in, just, over, three, and, a, half, days, with, an, orbital, radius, of, about, 670, 900, km, with, an, orbital, eccentricity, of, only, 0, 009, the, orbit, itself, is, nearly, circular, and, the, orbital, inclination, relative, to, jupiter, s, equatorial, plane, is, small, at, 0, 470, like, its, fellow, galilean, satellites, europa, is, tidally, locked, to, jupiter, with, one, hemisphere, of, europa, constantly, facing, jupiter, because, of, this, there, is, a, sub, jovian, point, on, europa, s, surface, from, which, jupiter, would, appear, to, hang, directly, overhead, europa, s, prime, meridian, is, a, line, passing, through, this, point, research, suggests, that, tidal, locking, may, not, be, full, as, a, non, synchronous, rotation, has, been, proposed, europa, spins, faster, than, it, orbits, or, at, least, did, so, in, the, past, this, suggests, an, asymmetry, in, internal, mass, distribution, and, that, a, layer, of, subsurface, liquid, separates, the, icy, crust, from, the, rocky, interior, the, slight, eccentricity, of, europa, s, orbit, maintained, by, gravitational, disturbances, from, the, other, galileans, causes, europa, s, sub, jovian, point, to, oscillate, around, a, mean, position, as, europa, comes, slightly, nearer, to, jupiter, jupiter, s, gravitational, attraction, increases, causing, europa, to, elongate, towards, and, away, from, it, as, europa, moves, slightly, away, from, jupiter, jupiter, s, gravitational, force, decreases, causing, europa, to, relax, back, into, a, more, spherical, shape, and, creating, tides, in, its, ocean, the, orbital, eccentricity, of, europa, is, continuously, pumped, by, its, mean, motion, resonance, with, io, thus, the, tidal, flexing, kneads, europa, s, interior, and, gives, it, a, source, of, heat, possibly, allowing, its, ocean, to, stay, liquid, while, driving, subsurface, geological, processes, the, ultimate, source, of, this, energy, is, jupiter, s, rotation, which, is, tapped, by, io, through, the, tides, it, raises, on, jupiter, and, is, transferred, to, europa, and, ganymede, by, the, orbital, resonance, analysis, of, the, unique, cracks, lining, europa, yielded, evidence, that, it, likely, spun, around, a, tilted, axis, at, some, point, in, time, if, correct, this, would, explain, many, of, europa, s, features, europa, s, immense, network, of, crisscrossing, cracks, serves, as, a, record, of, the, stresses, caused, by, massive, tides, in, its, global, ocean, europa, s, tilt, could, influence, calculations, of, how, much, of, its, history, is, recorded, in, its, frozen, shell, how, much, heat, is, generated, by, tides, in, its, ocean, and, even, how, long, the, ocean, has, been, liquid, its, ice, layer, must, stretch, to, accommodate, these, changes, when, there, is, too, much, stress, it, cracks, a, tilt, in, europa, s, axis, could, suggest, that, its, cracks, may, be, much, more, recent, than, previously, thought, the, reason, for, this, is, that, the, direction, of, the, spin, pole, may, change, by, as, much, as, a, few, degrees, per, day, completing, one, precession, period, over, several, months, a, tilt, could, also, affect, estimates, of, the, age, of, europa, s, ocean, tidal, forces, are, thought, to, generate, the, heat, that, keeps, europa, s, ocean, liquid, and, a, tilt, in, the, spin, axis, would, cause, more, heat, to, be, generated, by, tidal, forces, such, additional, heat, would, have, allowed, the, ocean, to, remain, liquid, for, a, longer, time, however, it, has, not, yet, been, determined, when, this, hypothesized, shift, in, the, spin, axis, might, have, occurred, europa, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, earth, s, moon, at, just, over, 3, 100, kilometres, 1, 900, mi, in, diameter, it, is, the, sixth, largest, moon, and, fifteenth, largest, object, in, the, solar, system, though, by, a, wide, margin, the, least, massive, of, the, galilean, satellites, it, is, nonetheless, more, massive, than, all, known, moons, in, the, solar, system, smaller, than, itself, combined, its, bulk, density, suggests, that, it, is, similar, in, composition, to, terrestrial, planets, being, primarily, composed, of, silicate, rock, it, is, estimated, that, europa, has, an, outer, layer, of, water, around, 100, km, 62, mi, thick, a, part, frozen, as, its, crust, and, a, part, as, a, liquid, ocean, underneath, the, ice, recent, magnetic, field, data, from, the, galileo, orbiter, showed, that, europa, has, an, induced, magnetic, field, through, interaction, with, jupiter, s, which, suggests, the, presence, of, a, subsurface, conductive, layer, this, layer, is, likely, to, be, a, salty, liquid, water, ocean, portions, of, the, crust, are, estimated, to, have, undergone, a, rotation, of, nearly, 80, nearly, flipping, over, see, true, polar, wander, which, would, be, unlikely, if, the, ice, were, solidly, attached, to, the, mantle, europa, probably, contains, a, metallic, iron, core, europa, is, the, smoothest, known, object, in, the, solar, system, lacking, large, scale, features, such, as, mountains, and, craters, the, prominent, markings, crisscrossing, europa, appear, to, be, mainly, albedo, features, that, emphasize, low, topography, there, are, few, craters, on, europa, because, its, surface, is, tectonically, too, active, and, therefore, young, its, icy, crust, has, an, albedo, light, reflectivity, of, 0, 64, one, of, the, highest, of, any, moon, this, indicates, a, young, and, active, surface, based, on, estimates, of, the, frequency, of, cometary, bombardment, that, europa, experiences, the, surface, is, about, 20, to, 180, million, years, old, there, is, no, scientific, consensus, about, the, explanation, for, europa, s, surface, features, it, has, been, postulated, europa, s, equator, may, be, covered, in, icy, spikes, called, penitentes, which, may, be, up, to, 15, meters, high, their, formation, is, due, to, direct, overhead, sunlight, near, the, equator, causing, the, ice, to, sublime, forming, vertical, cracks, although, the, imaging, available, from, the, galileo, orbiter, does, not, have, the, resolution, for, confirmation, radar, and, thermal, data, are, consistent, with, this, speculation, the, ionizing, radiation, level, at, europa, s, surface, is, equivalent, to, a, daily, dose, of, about, 5, 4, sv, 540, rem, an, amount, that, would, cause, severe, illness, or, death, in, human, beings, exposed, for, a, single, earth, day, 24, hours, a, europan, day, is, about, 3, 5, times, as, long, as, an, earth, day, europa, s, most, striking, surface, features, are, a, series, of, dark, streaks, crisscrossing, the, entire, globe, called, lineae, english, lines, close, examination, shows, that, the, edges, of, europa, s, crust, on, either, side, of, the, cracks, have, moved, relative, to, each, other, the, larger, bands, are, more, than, 20, km, 12, mi, across, often, with, dark, diffuse, outer, edges, regular, striations, and, a, central, band, of, lighter, material, the, most, likely, hypothesis, is, that, the, lineae, on, europa, were, produced, by, a, series, of, eruptions, of, warm, ice, as, europa, s, crust, slowly, spreads, open, to, expose, warmer, layers, beneath, the, effect, would, have, been, similar, to, that, seen, on, earth, s, oceanic, ridges, these, various, fractures, are, thought, to, have, been, caused, in, large, part, by, the, tidal, flexing, exerted, by, jupiter, because, europa, is, tidally, locked, to, jupiter, and, therefore, always, maintains, approximately, the, same, orientation, towards, jupiter, the, stress, patterns, should, form, a, distinctive, and, predictable, pattern, however, only, the, youngest, of, europa, s, fractures, conform, to, the, predicted, pattern, other, fractures, appear, to, occur, at, increasingly, different, orientations, the, older, they, are, this, could, be, explained, if, europa, s, surface, rotates, slightly, faster, than, its, interior, an, effect, that, is, possible, due, to, the, subsurface, ocean, mechanically, decoupling, europa, s, surface, from, its, rocky, mantle, and, the, effects, of, jupiter, s, gravity, tugging, on, europa, s, outer, ice, crust, comparisons, of, voyager, and, galileo, spacecraft, photos, serve, to, put, an, upper, limit, on, this, hypothetical, slippage, a, full, revolution, of, the, outer, rigid, shell, relative, to, the, interior, of, europa, takes, at, least, 12, 000, years, studies, of, voyager, and, galileo, images, have, revealed, evidence, of, subduction, on, europa, s, surface, suggesting, that, just, as, the, cracks, are, analogous, to, ocean, ridges, so, plates, of, icy, crust, analogous, to, tectonic, plates, on, earth, are, recycled, into, the, molten, interior, this, evidence, of, both, crustal, spreading, at, bands, and, convergence, at, other, sites, suggests, that, europa, may, have, active, plate, tectonics, similar, to, earth, however, the, physics, driving, these, plate, tectonics, are, not, likely, to, resemble, those, driving, terrestrial, plate, tectonics, as, the, forces, resisting, potential, earth, like, plate, motions, in, europa, s, crust, are, significantly, stronger, than, the, forces, that, could, drive, them, other, features, present, on, europa, are, circular, and, elliptical, lenticulae, latin, for, freckles, many, are, domes, some, are, pits, and, some, are, smooth, dark, spots, others, have, a, jumbled, or, rough, texture, the, dome, tops, look, like, pieces, of, the, older, plains, around, them, suggesting, that, the, domes, formed, when, the, plains, were, pushed, up, from, below, one, hypothesis, states, that, these, lenticulae, were, formed, by, diapirs, of, warm, ice, rising, up, through, the, colder, ice, of, the, outer, crust, much, like, magma, chambers, in, earth, s, crust, the, smooth, dark, spots, could, be, formed, by, meltwater, released, when, the, warm, ice, breaks, through, the, surface, the, rough, jumbled, lenticulae, called, regions, of, chaos, for, example, conamara, chaos, would, then, be, formed, from, many, small, fragments, of, crust, embedded, in, hummocky, dark, material, appearing, like, icebergs, in, a, frozen, sea, an, alternative, hypothesis, suggests, that, lenticulae, are, actually, small, areas, of, chaos, and, that, the, claimed, pits, spots, and, domes, are, artefacts, resulting, from, the, over, interpretation, of, early, low, resolution, galileo, images, the, implication, is, that, the, ice, is, too, thin, to, support, the, convective, diapir, model, of, feature, formation, in, november, 2011, a, team, of, researchers, from, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, and, elsewhere, presented, evidence, in, the, journal, nature, suggesting, that, many, chaos, terrain, features, on, europa, sit, atop, vast, lakes, of, liquid, water, these, lakes, would, be, entirely, encased, in, europa, s, icy, outer, shell, and, distinct, from, a, liquid, ocean, thought, to, exist, farther, down, beneath, the, ice, shell, full, confirmation, of, the, lakes, existence, will, require, a, space, mission, designed, to, probe, the, ice, shell, either, physically, or, indirectly, e, g, using, radar, work, published, by, researchers, from, williams, college, suggests, that, chaos, terrain, may, represent, sites, where, impacting, comets, penetrated, through, the, ice, crust, and, into, an, underlying, ocean, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, a, layer, of, liquid, water, exists, beneath, europa, s, surface, and, that, heat, from, tidal, flexing, allows, the, subsurface, ocean, to, remain, liquid, europa, s, surface, temperature, averages, about, 110, k, 160, c, 260, f, at, the, equator, and, only, 50, k, 220, c, 370, f, at, the, poles, keeping, europa, s, icy, crust, as, hard, as, granite, the, first, hints, of, a, subsurface, ocean, came, from, theoretical, considerations, of, tidal, heating, a, consequence, of, europa, s, slightly, eccentric, orbit, and, orbital, resonance, with, the, other, galilean, moons, galileo, imaging, team, members, argue, for, the, existence, of, a, subsurface, ocean, from, analysis, of, voyager, and, galileo, images, the, most, dramatic, example, is, chaos, terrain, a, common, feature, on, europa, s, surface, that, some, interpret, as, a, region, where, the, subsurface, ocean, has, melted, through, the, icy, crust, this, interpretation, is, controversial, most, geologists, who, have, studied, europa, favor, what, is, commonly, called, the, thick, ice, model, in, which, the, ocean, has, rarely, if, ever, directly, interacted, with, the, present, surface, the, best, evidence, for, the, thick, ice, model, is, a, study, of, europa, s, large, craters, the, largest, impact, structures, are, surrounded, by, concentric, rings, and, appear, to, be, filled, with, relatively, flat, fresh, ice, based, on, this, and, on, the, calculated, amount, of, heat, generated, by, europan, tides, it, is, estimated, that, the, outer, crust, of, solid, ice, is, approximately, 10, to, 30, km, 6, to, 20, mi, thick, including, a, ductile, warm, ice, layer, which, could, mean, that, the, liquid, ocean, underneath, may, be, about, 100, km, 60, mi, deep, this, leads, to, a, volume, of, europa, s, oceans, of, 3, 10, 18, m, 3, between, two, or, three, times, the, volume, of, earth, s, oceans, the, thin, ice, model, suggests, that, europa, s, ice, shell, may, be, only, a, few, kilometers, thick, however, most, planetary, scientists, conclude, that, this, model, considers, only, those, topmost, layers, of, europa, s, crust, that, behave, elastically, when, affected, by, jupiter, s, tides, one, example, is, flexure, analysis, in, which, europa, s, crust, is, modeled, as, a, plane, or, sphere, weighted, and, flexed, by, a, heavy, load, models, such, as, this, suggest, the, outer, elastic, portion, of, the, ice, crust, could, be, as, thin, as, 200, metres, 660, ft, if, the, ice, shell, of, europa, is, really, only, a, few, kilometers, thick, this, thin, ice, model, would, mean, that, regular, contact, of, the, liquid, interior, with, the, surface, could, occur, through, open, ridges, causing, the, formation, of, areas, of, chaotic, terrain, large, impacts, going, fully, through, the, ice, crust, would, also, be, a, way, that, the, subsurface, ocean, could, be, exposed, the, galileo, orbiter, found, that, europa, has, a, weak, magnetic, moment, which, is, induced, by, the, varying, part, of, the, jovian, magnetic, field, the, field, strength, at, the, magnetic, equator, about, 120, nt, created, by, this, magnetic, moment, is, about, one, sixth, the, strength, of, ganymede, s, field, and, six, times, the, value, of, callisto, s, the, existence, of, the, induced, moment, requires, a, layer, of, a, highly, electrically, conductive, material, in, europa, s, interior, the, most, plausible, candidate, for, this, role, is, a, large, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, saltwater, since, the, voyager, spacecraft, flew, past, europa, in, 1979, scientists, have, worked, to, understand, the, composition, of, the, reddish, brown, material, that, coats, fractures, and, other, geologically, youthful, features, on, europa, s, surface, spectrographic, evidence, suggests, that, the, darker, reddish, streaks, and, features, on, europa, s, surface, may, be, rich, in, salts, such, as, magnesium, sulfate, deposited, by, evaporating, water, that, emerged, from, within, sulfuric, acid, hydrate, is, another, possible, explanation, for, the, contaminant, observed, spectroscopically, in, either, case, because, these, materials, are, colorless, or, white, when, pure, some, other, material, must, also, be, present, to, account, for, the, reddish, color, and, sulfur, compounds, are, suspected, another, hypothesis, for, the, colored, regions, is, that, they, are, composed, of, abiotic, organic, compounds, collectively, called, tholins, the, morphology, of, europa, s, impact, craters, and, ridges, is, suggestive, of, fluidized, material, welling, up, from, the, fractures, where, pyrolysis, and, radiolysis, take, place, in, order, to, generate, colored, tholins, on, europa, there, must, be, a, source, of, materials, carbon, nitrogen, and, water, and, a, source, of, energy, to, make, the, reactions, occur, impurities, in, the, water, ice, crust, of, europa, are, presumed, both, to, emerge, from, the, interior, as, cryovolcanic, events, that, resurface, the, body, and, to, accumulate, from, space, as, interplanetary, dust, tholins, bring, important, astrobiological, implications, as, they, may, play, a, role, in, prebiotic, chemistry, and, abiogenesis, the, presence, of, sodium, chloride, in, the, internal, ocean, has, been, suggested, by, a, 450, nm, absorption, feature, characteristic, of, irradiated, nacl, crystals, that, has, been, spotted, in, hst, observations, of, the, chaos, regions, presumed, to, be, areas, of, recent, subsurface, upwelling, the, subterranean, ocean, of, europa, contains, carbon, and, was, observed, on, the, surface, ice, as, a, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, within, tara, regio, a, geologically, recently, resurfaced, terrain, europa, receives, thermal, energy, from, tidal, heating, which, occurs, through, the, tidal, friction, and, tidal, flexing, processes, caused, by, tidal, acceleration, orbital, and, rotational, energy, are, dissipated, as, heat, in, the, core, of, the, moon, the, internal, ocean, and, the, ice, crust, ocean, tides, are, converted, to, heat, by, frictional, losses, in, the, oceans, and, their, interaction, with, the, solid, bottom, and, with, the, top, ice, crust, in, late, 2008, it, was, suggested, jupiter, may, keep, europa, s, oceans, warm, by, generating, large, planetary, tidal, waves, on, europa, because, of, its, small, but, non, zero, obliquity, this, generates, so, called, rossby, waves, that, travel, quite, slowly, at, just, a, few, kilometers, per, day, but, can, generate, significant, kinetic, energy, for, the, current, axial, tilt, estimate, of, 0, 1, degree, the, resonance, from, rossby, waves, would, contain, 7, 3, 10, 18, j, of, kinetic, energy, which, is, two, thousand, times, larger, than, that, of, the, flow, excited, by, the, dominant, tidal, forces, dissipation, of, this, energy, could, be, the, principal, heat, source, of, europa, s, ocean, tidal, flexing, kneads, europa, s, interior, and, ice, shell, which, becomes, a, source, of, heat, depending, on, the, amount, of, tilt, the, heat, generated, by, the, ocean, flow, could, be, 100, to, thousands, of, times, greater, than, the, heat, generated, by, the, flexing, of, europa, s, rocky, core, in, response, to, the, gravitational, pull, from, jupiter, and, the, other, moons, circling, that, planet, europa, s, seafloor, could, be, heated, by, the, moon, s, constant, flexing, driving, hydrothermal, activity, similar, to, undersea, volcanoes, in, earth, s, oceans, experiments, and, ice, modeling, published, in, 2016, indicate, that, tidal, flexing, dissipation, can, generate, one, order, of, magnitude, more, heat, in, europa, s, ice, than, scientists, had, previously, assumed, their, results, indicate, that, most, of, the, heat, generated, by, the, ice, actually, comes, from, the, ice, s, crystalline, structure, lattice, as, a, result, of, deformation, and, not, friction, between, the, ice, grains, the, greater, the, deformation, of, the, ice, sheet, the, more, heat, is, generated, in, addition, to, tidal, heating, the, interior, of, europa, could, also, be, heated, by, the, decay, of, radioactive, material, radiogenic, heating, within, the, rocky, mantle, but, the, models, and, values, observed, are, one, hundred, times, higher, than, those, that, could, be, produced, by, radiogenic, heating, alone, thus, implying, that, tidal, heating, has, a, leading, role, in, europa, the, hubble, space, telescope, acquired, an, image, of, europa, in, 2012, that, was, interpreted, to, be, a, plume, of, water, vapour, erupting, from, near, its, south, pole, the, image, suggests, the, plume, may, be, 200, km, 120, mi, high, or, more, than, 20, times, the, height, of, mt, everest, though, recent, observations, and, modeling, suggest, that, typical, europan, plumes, may, be, much, smaller, it, has, been, suggested, that, if, plumes, exist, they, are, episodic, and, likely, to, appear, when, europa, is, at, its, farthest, point, from, jupiter, in, agreement, with, tidal, force, modeling, predictions, additional, imaging, evidence, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, was, presented, in, september, 2016, in, may, 2018, astronomers, provided, supporting, evidence, of, water, plume, activity, on, europa, based, on, an, updated, critical, analysis, of, data, obtained, from, the, galileo, space, probe, which, orbited, jupiter, between, 1995, and, 2003, galileo, flew, by, europa, in, 1997, within, 206, km, 128, mi, of, the, moon, s, surface, and, the, researchers, suggest, it, may, have, flown, through, a, water, plume, such, plume, activity, could, help, researchers, in, a, search, for, life, from, the, subsurface, europan, ocean, without, having, to, land, on, the, moon, the, tidal, forces, are, about, 1, 000, times, stronger, than, the, moon, s, effect, on, earth, the, only, other, moon, in, the, solar, system, exhibiting, water, vapor, plumes, is, enceladus, the, estimated, eruption, rate, at, europa, is, about, 7000, kg, s, compared, to, about, 200, kg, s, for, the, plumes, of, enceladus, if, confirmed, it, would, open, the, possibility, of, a, flyby, through, the, plume, and, obtain, a, sample, to, analyze, in, situ, without, having, to, use, a, lander, and, drill, through, kilometres, of, ice, in, november, 2020, a, study, was, published, in, the, peer, reviewed, scientific, journal, geophysical, research, letters, suggesting, that, the, plumes, may, originate, from, water, within, the, crust, of, europa, as, opposed, to, its, subsurface, ocean, the, study, s, model, using, images, from, the, galileo, space, probe, proposed, that, a, combination, of, freezing, and, pressurization, may, result, in, at, least, some, of, the, cryovolcanic, activity, the, pressure, generated, by, migrating, briny, water, pockets, would, thus, eventually, burst, through, the, crust, thereby, creating, these, plumes, the, hypothesis, that, cryovolcanism, on, europa, could, be, triggered, by, freezing, and, pressurization, of, liquid, pockets, in, the, icy, crust, was, first, proposed, by, sarah, fagents, at, the, university, of, hawai, i, at, m, noa, who, in, 2003, was, the, first, to, model, and, publish, work, on, this, process, a, press, release, from, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, referencing, the, november, 2020, study, suggested, that, plumes, sourced, from, migrating, liquid, pockets, could, potentially, be, less, hospitable, to, life, this, is, due, to, a, lack, of, substantial, energy, for, organisms, to, thrive, off, unlike, proposed, hydrothermal, vents, on, the, subsurface, ocean, floor, the, atmosphere, of, europa, can, be, categorized, as, thin, and, tenuous, often, called, an, exosphere, primarily, composed, of, oxygen, and, trace, amounts, of, water, vapor, however, this, quantity, of, oxygen, is, produced, in, a, non, biological, manner, given, that, europa, s, surface, is, icy, and, subsequently, very, cold, as, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, and, charged, particles, ions, and, electrons, from, the, jovian, magnetospheric, environment, collide, with, europa, s, surface, water, vapor, is, created, and, instantaneously, separated, into, oxygen, and, hydrogen, constituents, as, it, continues, to, move, the, hydrogen, is, light, enough, to, pass, through, the, surface, gravity, of, the, atmosphere, leaving, behind, only, oxygen, the, surface, bounded, atmosphere, forms, through, radiolysis, the, dissociation, of, molecules, through, radiation, this, accumulated, oxygen, atmosphere, can, get, to, a, height, of, 190, km, 120, mi, above, the, surface, of, europa, molecular, oxygen, is, the, densest, component, of, the, atmosphere, because, it, has, a, long, lifetime, after, returning, to, the, surface, it, does, not, stick, freeze, like, a, water, or, hydrogen, peroxide, molecule, but, rather, desorbs, from, the, surface, and, starts, another, ballistic, arc, molecular, hydrogen, never, reaches, the, surface, as, it, is, light, enough, to, escape, europa, s, surface, gravity, europa, is, one, of, the, few, moons, in, our, solar, system, with, a, quantifiable, atmosphere, along, with, titan, io, triton, ganymede, and, callisto, europa, is, also, one, of, several, moons, in, our, solar, system, with, very, large, quantities, of, ice, volatiles, otherwise, known, as, icy, moons, europa, is, also, considered, to, be, geologically, active, due, to, the, constant, release, of, hydrogen, oxygen, mixtures, into, space, as, a, result, of, the, moon, s, particle, venting, the, atmosphere, requires, continuous, replenishment, europa, also, contains, a, small, magnetosphere, approximately, 25, of, ganymede, s, however, this, magnetosphere, varies, in, size, as, europa, orbits, through, jupiter, s, magnetic, field, this, confirms, that, a, conductive, element, such, as, a, large, ocean, likely, lies, below, its, icy, surface, as, multiple, studies, have, been, conducted, over, europa, s, atmosphere, several, findings, conclude, that, not, all, oxygen, molecules, are, released, into, the, atmosphere, this, unknown, percentage, of, oxygen, may, be, absorbed, into, the, surface, and, sink, into, the, subsurface, because, the, surface, may, interact, with, the, subsurface, ocean, considering, the, geological, discussion, above, this, molecular, oxygen, may, make, its, way, to, the, ocean, where, it, could, aid, in, biological, processes, one, estimate, suggests, that, given, the, turnover, rate, inferred, from, the, apparent, 0, 5, gyr, maximum, age, of, europa, s, surface, ice, subduction, of, radiolytically, generated, oxidizing, species, might, well, lead, to, oceanic, free, oxygen, concentrations, that, are, comparable, to, those, in, terrestrial, deep, oceans, through, the, slow, release, of, oxygen, and, hydrogen, a, neutral, torus, around, europa, s, orbital, plane, is, formed, this, neutral, cloud, has, been, detected, by, both, the, cassini, and, galileo, spacecraft, and, has, a, greater, content, number, of, atoms, and, molecules, than, the, neutral, cloud, surrounding, jupiter, s, inner, moon, io, this, torus, was, officially, confirmed, using, energetic, neutral, atom, ena, imaging, europa, s, torus, ionizes, through, the, process, of, neutral, particles, exchanging, electrons, with, its, charged, particles, since, europa, s, magnetic, field, rotates, faster, than, its, orbital, velocity, these, ions, are, left, in, the, path, of, its, magnetic, field, trajectory, forming, a, plasma, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, these, ions, are, responsible, for, the, plasma, within, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, on, 4, march, 2024, astronomers, reported, that, the, surface, of, europa, may, have, much, less, oxygen, than, previously, inferred, the, atmosphere, of, europa, was, first, discovered, in, 1995, by, astronomers, d, t, hall, and, collaborators, using, the, goddard, high, resolution, spectrograph, instrument, of, the, hubble, space, telescope, this, observation, was, further, supported, in, 1997, by, the, galileo, orbiter, during, its, mission, within, the, jovian, system, the, galileo, orbiter, performed, three, radio, occultation, events, of, europa, where, the, probe, s, radio, contact, with, earth, was, temporarily, blocked, by, passing, behind, europa, by, analyzing, the, effects, europa, s, sparse, atmosphere, had, on, the, radio, signal, just, before, and, after, the, occultation, for, a, total, of, six, events, a, team, of, astronomers, led, by, a, j, kliore, established, the, presence, of, an, ionized, layer, in, europa, s, atmosphere, despite, the, presence, of, a, gas, torus, europa, has, no, weather, producing, clouds, as, a, whole, europa, has, no, wind, precipitation, or, presence, of, sky, color, as, its, gravity, is, too, low, to, hold, an, atmosphere, substantial, enough, for, those, features, europa, s, gravity, is, approximately, 13, of, earth, s, the, temperature, on, europa, varies, from, 160, c, at, the, equator, to, 220, c, at, either, of, its, poles, europa, s, subsurface, ocean, is, thought, to, be, subsequently, warm, however, it, is, hypothesized, that, because, of, radioactive, and, tidal, heating, as, mentioned, in, the, sections, above, there, are, points, in, the, depths, of, europa, s, ocean, that, may, be, only, slightly, cooler, than, earth, s, oceans, studies, have, also, concluded, that, europa, s, ocean, would, have, been, rather, acidic, at, first, with, large, concentrations, of, sulfate, calcium, and, carbon, dioxide, but, over, the, course, of, 4, 5, billion, years, it, became, full, of, chloride, thus, resembling, our, 1, 94, chloride, oceans, on, earth, exploration, of, europa, began, with, the, jupiter, flybys, of, pioneer, 10, and, 11, in, 1973, and, 1974, respectively, the, first, closeup, photos, were, of, low, resolution, compared, to, later, missions, the, two, voyager, probes, traveled, through, the, jovian, system, in, 1979, providing, more, detailed, images, of, europa, s, icy, surface, the, images, caused, many, scientists, to, speculate, about, the, possibility, of, a, liquid, ocean, underneath, starting, in, 1995, the, galileo, space, probe, orbited, jupiter, for, eight, years, until, 2003, and, provided, the, most, detailed, examination, of, the, galilean, moons, to, date, it, included, the, galileo, europa, mission, and, galileo, millennium, mission, with, numerous, close, flybys, of, europa, in, 2007, new, horizons, imaged, europa, as, it, flew, by, the, jovian, system, while, on, its, way, to, pluto, in, 2022, the, juno, orbiter, flew, by, europa, at, a, distance, of, 352, km, 219, mi, in, 2012, jupiter, icy, moons, explorer, juice, was, selected, by, the, european, space, agency, esa, as, a, planned, mission, that, mission, includes, two, flybys, of, europa, but, is, more, focused, on, ganymede, it, was, launched, in, 2023, and, is, expected, to, reach, jupiter, in, july, 2031, after, four, gravity, assists, and, eight, years, of, travel, conjectures, regarding, extraterrestrial, life, have, ensured, a, high, profile, for, europa, and, have, led, to, steady, lobbying, for, future, missions, the, aims, of, these, missions, have, ranged, from, examining, europa, s, chemical, composition, to, searching, for, extraterrestrial, life, in, its, hypothesized, subsurface, oceans, robotic, missions, to, europa, need, to, endure, the, high, radiation, environment, around, jupiter, because, it, is, deeply, embedded, within, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, europa, receives, about, 5, 40, sv, of, radiation, per, day, in, 2011, a, europa, mission, was, recommended, by, the, u, s, planetary, science, decadal, survey, in, response, nasa, commissioned, concept, studies, of, a, europa, lander, in, 2011, along, with, concepts, for, a, europa, flyby, europa, clipper, and, a, europa, orbiter, the, orbiter, element, option, concentrates, on, the, ocean, science, while, the, multiple, flyby, element, clipper, concentrates, on, the, chemistry, and, energy, science, on, 13, january, 2014, the, house, appropriations, committee, announced, a, new, bipartisan, bill, that, includes, 80, million, in, funding, to, continue, the, europa, mission, concept, studies, in, the, early, 2000s, jupiter, europa, orbiter, led, by, nasa, and, the, jupiter, ganymede, orbiter, led, by, the, esa, were, proposed, together, as, an, outer, planet, flagship, mission, to, jupiter, s, icy, moons, called, europa, jupiter, system, mission, with, a, planned, launch, in, 2020, in, 2009, it, was, given, priority, over, titan, saturn, system, mission, at, that, time, there, was, competition, from, other, proposals, japan, proposed, jupiter, magnetospheric, orbiter, jovian, europa, orbiter, was, an, esa, cosmic, vision, concept, study, from, 2007, another, concept, was, ice, clipper, which, would, have, used, an, impactor, similar, to, the, deep, impact, mission, it, would, make, a, controlled, crash, into, the, surface, of, europa, generating, a, plume, of, debris, that, would, then, be, collected, by, a, small, spacecraft, flying, through, the, plume, jupiter, icy, moons, orbiter, jimo, was, a, partially, developed, fission, powered, spacecraft, with, ion, thrusters, that, was, cancelled, in, 2006, it, was, part, of, project, prometheus, the, europa, lander, mission, proposed, a, small, nuclear, powered, europa, lander, for, jimo, it, would, travel, with, the, orbiter, which, would, also, function, as, a, communication, relay, to, earth, europa, orbiter, its, objective, would, be, to, characterize, the, extent, of, the, ocean, and, its, relation, to, the, deeper, interior, instrument, payload, could, include, a, radio, subsystem, laser, altimeter, magnetometer, langmuir, probe, and, a, mapping, camera, the, europa, orbiter, received, the, go, ahead, in, 1999, but, was, canceled, in, 2002, this, orbiter, featured, a, special, ice, penetrating, radar, that, would, allow, it, to, scan, below, the, surface, more, ambitious, ideas, have, been, put, forward, including, an, impactor, in, combination, with, a, thermal, drill, to, search, for, biosignatures, that, might, be, frozen, in, the, shallow, subsurface, another, proposal, put, forward, in, 2001, calls, for, a, large, nuclear, powered, melt, probe, cryobot, that, would, melt, through, the, ice, until, it, reached, an, ocean, below, once, it, reached, the, water, it, would, deploy, an, autonomous, underwater, vehicle, hydrobot, that, would, gather, information, and, send, it, back, to, earth, both, the, cryobot, and, the, hydrobot, would, have, to, undergo, some, form, of, extreme, sterilization, to, prevent, detection, of, earth, organisms, instead, of, native, life, and, to, prevent, contamination, of, the, subsurface, ocean, this, suggested, approach, has, not, yet, reached, a, formal, conceptual, planning, stage, so, far, there, is, no, evidence, that, life, exists, on, europa, but, the, moon, has, emerged, as, one, of, the, most, likely, locations, in, the, solar, system, for, potential, habitability, life, could, exist, in, its, under, ice, ocean, perhaps, in, an, environment, similar, to, earth, s, deep, ocean, hydrothermal, vents, even, if, europa, lacks, volcanic, hydrothermal, activity, a, 2016, nasa, study, found, that, earth, like, levels, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, could, be, produced, through, processes, related, to, serpentinization, and, ice, derived, oxidants, which, do, not, directly, involve, volcanism, in, 2015, scientists, announced, that, salt, from, a, subsurface, ocean, may, likely, be, coating, some, geological, features, on, europa, suggesting, that, the, ocean, is, interacting, with, the, seafloor, this, may, be, important, in, determining, if, europa, could, be, habitable, the, likely, presence, of, liquid, water, in, contact, with, europa, s, rocky, mantle, has, spurred, calls, to, send, a, probe, there, the, energy, provided, by, tidal, forces, drives, active, geological, processes, within, europa, s, interior, just, as, they, do, to, a, far, more, obvious, degree, on, its, sister, moon, io, although, europa, like, the, earth, may, possess, an, internal, energy, source, from, radioactive, decay, the, energy, generated, by, tidal, flexing, would, be, several, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, any, radiological, source, life, on, europa, could, exist, clustered, around, hydrothermal, vents, on, the, ocean, floor, or, below, the, ocean, floor, where, endoliths, are, known, to, inhabit, on, earth, alternatively, it, could, exist, clinging, to, the, lower, surface, of, europa, s, ice, layer, much, like, algae, and, bacteria, in, earth, s, polar, regions, or, float, freely, in, europa, s, ocean, should, europa, s, oceans, be, too, cold, biological, processes, similar, to, those, known, on, earth, could, not, occur, too, salty, only, extreme, halophiles, could, survive, in, that, environment, in, 2010, a, model, proposed, by, richard, greenberg, of, the, university, of, arizona, proposed, that, irradiation, of, ice, on, europa, s, surface, could, saturate, its, crust, with, oxygen, and, peroxide, which, could, then, be, transported, by, tectonic, processes, into, the, interior, ocean, such, a, process, could, render, europa, s, ocean, as, oxygenated, as, our, own, within, just, 12, million, years, allowing, the, existence, of, complex, multicellular, lifeforms, evidence, suggests, the, existence, of, lakes, of, liquid, water, entirely, encased, in, europa, s, icy, outer, shell, and, distinct, from, a, liquid, ocean, thought, to, exist, farther, down, beneath, the, ice, shell, as, well, as, pockets, of, water, that, form, m, shaped, ice, ridges, when, the, water, freezes, on, the, surface, as, in, greenland, if, confirmed, the, lakes, and, pockets, of, water, could, be, yet, another, potential, habitat, for, life, evidence, suggests, that, hydrogen, peroxide, is, abundant, across, much, of, the, surface, of, europa, because, hydrogen, peroxide, decays, into, oxygen, and, water, when, combined, with, liquid, water, the, authors, argue, that, it, could, be, an, important, energy, supply, for, simple, life, forms, nonetheless, on, 4, march, 2024, astronomers, reported, that, the, surface, of, europa, may, have, much, less, oxygen, than, previously, inferred, clay, like, minerals, specifically, phyllosilicates, often, associated, with, organic, matter, on, earth, have, been, detected, on, the, icy, crust, of, europa, the, presence, of, the, minerals, may, have, been, the, result, of, a, collision, with, an, asteroid, or, comet, some, scientists, have, speculated, that, life, on, earth, could, have, been, blasted, into, space, by, asteroid, collisions, and, arrived, on, the, moons, of, jupiter, in, a, process, called, lithopanspermia, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow, may, be, read, as, within, or, part, of
