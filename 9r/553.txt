an, avalanche, is, a, rapid, flow, of, snow, down, a, slope, such, as, a, hill, or, mountain, avalanches, can, be, triggered, spontaneously, by, factors, such, as, increased, precipitation, or, snowpack, weakening, or, by, external, means, such, as, humans, other, animals, and, earthquakes, primarily, composed, of, flowing, snow, and, air, large, avalanches, have, the, capability, to, capture, and, move, ice, rocks, and, trees, avalanches, occur, in, two, general, forms, or, combinations, thereof, slab, avalanches, made, of, tightly, packed, snow, triggered, by, a, collapse, of, an, underlying, weak, snow, layer, and, loose, snow, avalanches, made, of, looser, snow, after, being, set, off, avalanches, usually, accelerate, rapidly, and, grow, in, mass, and, volume, as, they, capture, more, snow, if, an, avalanche, moves, fast, enough, some, of, the, snow, may, mix, with, the, air, forming, a, powder, snow, avalanche, though, they, appear, to, share, similarities, avalanches, are, distinct, from, slush, flows, mudslides, rock, slides, and, serac, collapses, they, are, also, different, from, large, scale, movements, of, ice, avalanches, can, happen, in, any, mountain, range, that, has, an, enduring, snowpack, they, are, most, frequent, in, winter, or, spring, but, may, occur, at, any, time, of, the, year, in, mountainous, areas, avalanches, are, among, the, most, serious, natural, hazards, to, life, and, property, so, great, efforts, are, made, in, avalanche, control, there, are, many, classification, systems, for, the, different, forms, of, avalanches, avalanches, can, be, described, by, their, size, destructive, potential, initiation, mechanism, composition, and, dynamics, most, avalanches, occur, spontaneously, during, storms, under, increased, load, due, to, snowfall, and, or, erosion, metamorphic, changes, in, the, snowpack, such, as, melting, due, to, solar, radiation, is, the, second, largest, cause, of, natural, avalanches, other, natural, causes, include, rain, earthquakes, rockfall, and, icefall, artificial, triggers, of, avalanches, include, skiers, snowmobiles, and, controlled, explosive, work, contrary, to, popular, belief, avalanches, are, not, triggered, by, loud, sound, the, pressure, from, sound, is, orders, of, magnitude, too, small, to, trigger, an, avalanche, avalanche, initiation, can, start, at, a, point, with, only, a, small, amount, of, snow, moving, initially, this, is, typical, of, wet, snow, avalanches, or, avalanches, in, dry, unconsolidated, snow, however, if, the, snow, has, sintered, into, a, stiff, slab, overlying, a, weak, layer, then, fractures, can, propagate, very, rapidly, so, that, a, large, volume, of, snow, possibly, thousands, of, cubic, metres, can, start, moving, almost, simultaneously, a, snowpack, will, fail, when, the, load, exceeds, the, strength, the, load, is, straightforward, it, is, the, weight, of, the, snow, however, the, strength, of, the, snowpack, is, much, more, difficult, to, determine, and, is, extremely, heterogeneous, it, varies, in, detail, with, properties, of, the, snow, grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water, content, and, the, properties, of, the, bonds, between, the, grains, these, properties, may, all, metamorphose, in, time, according, to, the, local, humidity, water, vapour, flux, temperature, and, heat, flux, the, top, of, the, snowpack, is, also, extensively, influenced, by, incoming, radiation, and, the, local, air, flow, one, of, the, aims, of, avalanche, research, is, to, develop, and, validate, computer, models, that, can, describe, the, evolution, of, the, seasonal, snowpack, over, time, a, complicating, factor, is, the, complex, interaction, of, terrain, and, weather, which, causes, significant, spatial, and, temporal, variability, of, the, depths, crystal, forms, and, layering, of, the, seasonal, snowpack, slab, avalanches, are, formed, frequently, in, snow, that, has, been, deposited, or, redeposited, by, wind, they, have, the, characteristic, appearance, of, a, block, slab, of, snow, cut, out, from, its, surroundings, by, fractures, elements, of, slab, avalanches, include, a, crown, fracture, at, the, top, of, the, start, zone, flank, fractures, on, the, sides, of, the, start, zones, and, a, fracture, at, the, bottom, called, the, stauchwall, the, crown, and, flank, fractures, are, vertical, walls, in, the, snow, delineating, the, snow, that, was, entrained, in, the, avalanche, from, the, snow, that, remained, on, the, slope, slabs, can, vary, in, thickness, from, a, few, centimetres, to, three, metres, slab, avalanches, account, for, around, 90, of, avalanche, related, fatalities, the, largest, avalanches, form, turbulent, suspension, currents, known, as, powder, snow, avalanches, or, mixed, avalanches, a, kind, of, gravity, current, these, consist, of, a, powder, cloud, which, overlies, a, dense, avalanche, they, can, form, from, any, type, of, snow, or, initiation, mechanism, but, usually, occur, with, fresh, dry, powder, they, can, exceed, speeds, of, 300, km, h, 190, mph, and, masses, of, 1, 000, 000, tons, their, flows, can, travel, long, distances, along, flat, valley, bottoms, and, even, uphill, for, short, distances, in, contrast, to, powder, snow, avalanches, wet, snow, avalanches, are, a, low, velocity, suspension, of, snow, and, water, with, the, flow, confined, to, the, track, surface, mcclung, 1999, p, 108, the, low, speed, of, travel, is, due, to, the, friction, between, the, sliding, surface, of, the, track, and, the, water, saturated, flow, despite, the, low, speed, of, travel, 10, 40, km, h, wet, snow, avalanches, are, capable, of, generating, powerful, destructive, forces, due, to, the, large, mass, and, density, the, body, of, the, flow, of, a, wet, snow, avalanche, can, plough, through, soft, snow, and, can, scour, boulders, earth, trees, and, other, vegetation, leaving, exposed, and, often, scored, ground, in, the, avalanche, track, wet, snow, avalanches, can, be, initiated, from, either, loose, snow, releases, or, slab, releases, and, only, occur, in, snowpacks, that, are, water, saturated, and, isothermally, equilibrated, to, the, melting, point, of, water, the, isothermal, characteristic, of, wet, snow, avalanches, has, led, to, the, secondary, term, of, isothermal, slides, found, in, the, literature, for, example, in, daffern, 1999, p, 93, at, temperate, latitudes, wet, snow, avalanches, are, frequently, associated, with, climatic, avalanche, cycles, at, the, end, of, the, winter, season, when, there, is, significant, daytime, warming, an, ice, avalanche, occurs, when, a, large, piece, of, ice, such, as, from, a, serac, or, calving, glacier, falls, onto, ice, such, as, the, khumbu, icefall, triggering, a, movement, of, broken, ice, chunks, the, resulting, movement, is, more, analogous, to, a, rockfall, or, a, landslide, than, a, snow, avalanche, they, are, typically, very, difficult, to, predict, and, almost, impossible, to, mitigate, as, an, avalanche, moves, down, a, slope, it, follows, a, certain, pathway, that, is, dependent, on, the, slope, s, degree, of, steepness, and, the, volume, of, snow, ice, involved, in, the, mass, movement, the, origin, of, an, avalanche, is, called, the, starting, point, and, typically, occurs, on, a, 30, 45, degree, slope, the, body, of, the, pathway, is, called, the, track, of, the, avalanche, and, usually, occurs, on, a, 20, 30, degree, slope, when, the, avalanche, loses, its, momentum, and, eventually, stops, it, reaches, the, runout, zone, this, usually, occurs, when, the, slope, has, reached, a, steepness, that, is, less, than, 20, degrees, these, degrees, are, not, consistently, true, due, to, the, fact, that, each, avalanche, is, unique, depending, on, the, stability, of, the, snowpack, that, it, was, derived, from, as, well, as, the, environmental, or, human, influences, that, triggered, the, mass, movement, people, caught, in, avalanches, can, die, from, suffocation, trauma, or, hypothermia, from, 1950, 1951, to, 2020, 2021, there, were, 1, 169, people, who, died, in, avalanches, in, the, united, states, for, the, 11, year, period, ending, april, 2006, 445, people, died, in, avalanches, throughout, north, america, on, average, 28, people, die, in, avalanches, every, winter, in, the, united, states, in, 2001, it, was, reported, that, globally, an, average, of, 150, people, die, each, year, from, avalanches, three, of, the, deadliest, recorded, avalanches, have, killed, over, a, thousand, people, each, doug, fesler, and, jill, fredston, developed, a, conceptual, model, of, the, three, primary, elements, of, avalanches, terrain, weather, and, snowpack, terrain, describes, the, places, where, avalanches, occur, weather, describes, the, meteorological, conditions, that, create, the, snowpack, and, snowpack, describes, the, structural, characteristics, of, snow, that, make, avalanche, formation, possible, avalanche, formation, requires, a, slope, shallow, enough, for, snow, to, accumulate, but, steep, enough, for, the, snow, to, accelerate, once, set, in, motion, by, the, combination, of, mechanical, failure, of, the, snowpack, and, gravity, the, angle, of, the, slope, that, can, hold, snow, called, the, angle, of, repose, depends, on, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, crystal, form, and, moisture, content, some, forms, of, drier, and, colder, snow, will, only, stick, to, shallower, slopes, while, wet, and, warm, snow, can, bond, to, very, steep, surfaces, in, coastal, mountains, such, as, the, cordillera, del, paine, region, of, patagonia, deep, snowpacks, collect, on, vertical, and, even, overhanging, rock, faces, the, slope, angle, that, can, allow, moving, snow, to, accelerate, depends, on, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, the, snow, s, shear, strength, which, is, itself, dependent, upon, crystal, form, and, the, configuration, of, layers, and, inter, layer, interfaces, the, snowpack, on, slopes, with, sunny, exposures, is, strongly, influenced, by, sunshine, diurnal, cycles, of, thawing, and, refreezing, can, stabilize, the, snowpack, by, promoting, settlement, strong, freeze, thaw, cycles, result, in, the, formation, of, surface, crusts, during, the, night, and, of, unstable, surface, snow, during, the, day, slopes, in, the, lee, of, a, ridge, or, of, another, wind, obstacle, accumulate, more, snow, and, are, more, likely, to, include, pockets, of, deep, snow, wind, slabs, and, cornices, all, of, which, when, disturbed, may, result, in, avalanche, formation, conversely, the, snowpack, on, a, windward, slope, is, often, much, shallower, than, on, a, lee, slope, avalanches, and, avalanche, paths, share, common, elements, a, start, zone, where, the, avalanche, originates, a, track, along, which, the, avalanche, flows, and, a, runout, zone, where, the, avalanche, comes, to, rest, the, debris, deposit, is, the, accumulated, mass, of, the, avalanched, snow, once, it, has, come, to, rest, in, the, run, out, zone, for, the, image, at, left, many, small, avalanches, form, in, this, avalanche, path, every, year, but, most, of, these, avalanches, do, not, run, the, full, vertical, or, horizontal, length, of, the, path, the, frequency, with, which, avalanches, form, in, a, given, area, is, known, as, the, return, period, the, start, zone, of, an, avalanche, must, be, steep, enough, to, allow, snow, to, accelerate, once, set, in, motion, additionally, convex, slopes, are, less, stable, than, concave, slopes, because, of, the, disparity, between, the, tensile, strength, of, snow, layers, and, their, compressive, strength, the, composition, and, structure, of, the, ground, surface, beneath, the, snowpack, influences, the, stability, of, the, snowpack, either, being, a, source, of, strength, or, weakness, avalanches, are, unlikely, to, form, in, very, thick, forests, but, boulders, and, sparsely, distributed, vegetation, can, create, weak, areas, deep, within, the, snowpack, through, the, formation, of, strong, temperature, gradients, full, depth, avalanches, avalanches, that, sweep, a, slope, virtually, clean, of, snow, cover, are, more, common, on, slopes, with, smooth, ground, such, as, grass, or, rock, slabs, generally, speaking, avalanches, follow, drainages, down, slope, frequently, sharing, drainage, features, with, summertime, watersheds, at, and, below, tree, line, avalanche, paths, through, drainages, are, well, defined, by, vegetation, boundaries, called, trim, lines, which, occur, where, avalanches, have, removed, trees, and, prevented, regrowth, of, large, vegetation, engineered, drainages, such, as, the, avalanche, dam, on, mount, stephen, in, kicking, horse, pass, have, been, constructed, to, protect, people, and, property, by, redirecting, the, flow, of, avalanches, deep, debris, deposits, from, avalanches, will, collect, in, catchments, at, the, terminus, of, a, run, out, such, as, gullies, and, river, beds, slopes, flatter, than, 25, degrees, or, steeper, than, 60, degrees, typically, have, a, lower, incidence, of, avalanches, human, triggered, avalanches, have, the, greatest, incidence, when, the, snow, s, angle, of, repose, is, between, 35, and, 45, degrees, the, critical, angle, the, angle, at, which, human, triggered, avalanches, are, most, frequent, is, 38, degrees, when, the, incidence, of, human, triggered, avalanches, is, normalized, by, the, rates, of, recreational, use, however, hazard, increases, uniformly, with, slope, angle, and, no, significant, difference, in, hazard, for, a, given, exposure, direction, can, be, found, the, rule, of, thumb, is, a, slope, that, is, flat, enough, to, hold, snow, but, steep, enough, to, ski, has, the, potential, to, generate, an, avalanche, regardless, of, the, angle, the, snowpack, is, composed, of, ground, parallel, layers, that, accumulate, over, the, winter, each, layer, contains, ice, grains, that, are, representative, of, the, distinct, meteorological, conditions, during, which, the, snow, formed, and, was, deposited, once, deposited, a, snow, layer, continues, to, evolve, under, the, influence, of, the, meteorological, conditions, that, prevail, after, deposition, for, an, avalanche, to, occur, it, is, necessary, that, a, snowpack, have, a, weak, layer, or, instability, below, a, slab, of, cohesive, snow, in, practice, the, formal, mechanical, and, structural, factors, related, to, snowpack, instability, are, not, directly, observable, outside, of, laboratories, thus, the, more, easily, observed, properties, of, the, snow, layers, e, g, penetration, resistance, grain, size, grain, type, temperature, are, used, as, index, measurements, of, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, snow, e, g, tensile, strength, friction, coefficients, shear, strength, and, ductile, strength, this, results, in, two, principal, sources, of, uncertainty, in, determining, snowpack, stability, based, on, snow, structure, first, both, the, factors, influencing, snow, stability, and, the, specific, characteristics, of, the, snowpack, vary, widely, within, small, areas, and, time, scales, resulting, in, significant, difficulty, extrapolating, point, observations, of, snow, layers, across, different, scales, of, space, and, time, second, the, relationship, between, readily, observable, snowpack, characteristics, and, the, snowpack, s, critical, mechanical, properties, has, not, been, completely, developed, while, the, deterministic, relationship, between, snowpack, characteristics, and, snowpack, stability, is, still, a, matter, of, ongoing, scientific, study, there, is, a, growing, empirical, understanding, of, the, snow, composition, and, deposition, characteristics, that, influence, the, likelihood, of, an, avalanche, observation, and, experience, has, shown, that, newly, fallen, snow, requires, time, to, bond, with, the, snow, layers, beneath, it, especially, if, the, new, snow, falls, during, very, cold, and, dry, conditions, if, ambient, air, temperatures, are, cold, enough, shallow, snow, above, or, around, boulders, plants, and, other, discontinuities, in, the, slope, weakens, from, rapid, crystal, growth, that, occurs, in, the, presence, of, a, critical, temperature, gradient, large, angular, snow, crystals, are, indicators, of, weak, snow, because, such, crystals, have, fewer, bonds, per, unit, volume, than, small, rounded, crystals, that, pack, tightly, together, consolidated, snow, is, less, likely, to, slough, than, loose, powdery, layers, or, wet, isothermal, snow, however, consolidated, snow, is, a, necessary, condition, for, the, occurrence, of, slab, avalanches, and, persistent, instabilities, within, the, snowpack, can, hide, below, well, consolidated, surface, layers, uncertainty, associated, with, the, empirical, understanding, of, the, factors, influencing, snow, stability, leads, most, professional, avalanche, workers, to, recommend, conservative, use, of, avalanche, terrain, relative, to, current, snowpack, instability, avalanches, only, occur, in, a, standing, snowpack, typically, winter, seasons, at, high, latitudes, high, altitudes, or, both, have, weather, that, is, sufficiently, unsettled, and, cold, enough, for, precipitated, snow, to, accumulate, into, a, seasonal, snowpack, continentality, through, its, potentiating, influence, on, the, meteorological, extremes, experienced, by, snowpacks, is, an, important, factor, in, the, evolution, of, instabilities, and, consequential, occurrence, of, avalanches, faster, stabilization, of, the, snowpack, after, storm, cycles, the, evolution, of, the, snowpack, is, critically, sensitive, to, small, variations, within, the, narrow, range, of, meteorological, conditions, that, allow, for, the, accumulation, of, snow, into, a, snowpack, among, the, critical, factors, controlling, snowpack, evolution, are, heating, by, the, sun, radiational, cooling, vertical, temperature, gradients, in, standing, snow, snowfall, amounts, and, snow, types, generally, mild, winter, weather, will, promote, the, settlement, and, stabilization, of, the, snowpack, conversely, very, cold, windy, or, hot, weather, will, weaken, the, snowpack, at, temperatures, close, to, the, freezing, point, of, water, or, during, times, of, moderate, solar, radiation, a, gentle, freeze, thaw, cycle, will, take, place, the, melting, and, refreezing, of, water, in, the, snow, strengthens, the, snowpack, during, the, freezing, phase, and, weakens, it, during, the, thawing, phase, a, rapid, rise, in, temperature, to, a, point, significantly, above, the, freezing, point, of, water, may, cause, avalanche, formation, at, any, time, of, year, persistent, cold, temperatures, can, either, prevent, new, snow, from, stabilizing, or, destabilize, the, existing, snowpack, cold, air, temperatures, on, the, snow, surface, produce, a, temperature, gradient, in, the, snow, because, the, ground, temperature, at, the, base, of, the, snowpack, is, usually, around, 0, c, and, the, ambient, air, temperature, can, be, much, colder, when, a, temperature, gradient, greater, than, 10, c, change, per, vertical, meter, of, snow, is, sustained, for, more, than, a, day, angular, crystals, called, depth, hoar, or, facets, begin, forming, in, the, snowpack, because, of, rapid, moisture, transport, along, the, temperature, gradient, these, angular, crystals, which, bond, poorly, to, one, another, and, the, surrounding, snow, often, become, a, persistent, weakness, in, the, snowpack, when, a, slab, lying, on, top, of, a, persistent, weakness, is, loaded, by, a, force, greater, than, the, strength, of, the, slab, and, persistent, weak, layer, the, persistent, weak, layer, can, fail, and, generate, an, avalanche, any, wind, stronger, than, a, light, breeze, can, contribute, to, a, rapid, accumulation, of, snow, on, sheltered, slopes, downwind, wind, slabs, form, quickly, and, if, present, weaker, snow, below, the, slab, may, not, have, time, to, adjust, to, the, new, load, even, on, a, clear, day, wind, can, quickly, load, a, slope, with, snow, by, blowing, snow, from, one, place, to, another, top, loading, occurs, when, wind, deposits, snow, from, the, top, of, a, slope, cross, loading, occurs, when, wind, deposits, snow, parallel, to, the, slope, when, a, wind, blows, over, the, top, of, a, mountain, the, leeward, or, downwind, side, of, the, mountain, experiences, top, loading, from, the, top, to, the, bottom, of, that, lee, slope, when, the, wind, blows, across, a, ridge, that, leads, up, the, mountain, the, leeward, side, of, the, ridge, is, subject, to, cross, loading, cross, loaded, wind, slabs, are, usually, difficult, to, identify, visually, snowstorms, and, rainstorms, are, important, contributors, to, avalanche, danger, heavy, snowfall, will, cause, instability, in, the, existing, snowpack, both, because, of, the, additional, weight, and, because, the, new, snow, has, insufficient, time, to, bond, to, underlying, snow, layers, rain, has, a, similar, effect, in, the, short, term, rain, causes, instability, because, like, a, heavy, snowfall, it, imposes, an, additional, load, on, the, snowpack, and, once, rainwater, seeps, down, through, the, snow, acts, as, a, lubricant, reducing, the, natural, friction, between, snow, layers, that, holds, the, snowpack, together, most, avalanches, happen, during, or, soon, after, a, storm, daytime, exposure, to, sunlight, will, rapidly, destabilize, the, upper, layers, of, the, snowpack, if, the, sunlight, is, strong, enough, to, melt, the, snow, thereby, reducing, its, hardness, during, clear, nights, the, snowpack, can, re, freeze, when, ambient, air, temperatures, fall, below, freezing, through, the, process, of, long, wave, radiative, cooling, or, both, radiative, heat, loss, occurs, when, the, night, air, is, significantly, cooler, than, the, snowpack, and, the, heat, stored, in, the, snow, is, re, radiated, into, the, atmosphere, when, a, slab, avalanche, forms, the, slab, disintegrates, into, increasingly, smaller, fragments, as, the, snow, travels, downhill, if, the, fragments, become, small, enough, the, outer, layer, of, the, avalanche, called, a, saltation, layer, takes, on, the, characteristics, of, a, fluid, when, sufficiently, fine, particles, are, present, they, can, become, airborne, and, given, a, sufficient, quantity, of, airborne, snow, this, portion, of, the, avalanche, can, become, separated, from, the, bulk, of, the, avalanche, and, travel, a, greater, distance, as, a, powder, snow, avalanche, scientific, studies, using, radar, following, the, 1999, galt, r, avalanche, disaster, confirmed, the, hypothesis, that, a, saltation, layer, forms, between, the, surface, and, the, airborne, components, of, an, avalanche, which, can, also, separate, from, the, bulk, of, the, avalanche, driving, an, avalanche, is, the, component, of, the, avalanche, s, weight, parallel, to, the, slope, as, the, avalanche, progresses, any, unstable, snow, in, its, path, will, tend, to, become, incorporated, so, increasing, the, overall, weight, this, force, will, increase, as, the, steepness, of, the, slope, increases, and, diminish, as, the, slope, flattens, resisting, this, are, a, number, of, components, that, are, thought, to, interact, with, each, other, the, friction, between, the, avalanche, and, the, surface, beneath, friction, between, the, air, and, snow, within, the, fluid, fluid, dynamic, drag, at, the, leading, edge, of, the, avalanche, shear, resistance, between, the, avalanche, and, the, air, through, which, it, is, passing, and, shear, resistance, between, the, fragments, within, the, avalanche, itself, an, avalanche, will, continue, to, accelerate, until, the, resistance, exceeds, the, forward, force, attempts, to, model, avalanche, behaviour, date, from, the, early, 20th, century, notably, the, work, of, professor, lagotala, in, preparation, for, the, 1924, winter, olympics, in, chamonix, his, method, was, developed, by, a, voellmy, and, popularised, following, the, publication, in, 1955, of, his, ueber, die, zerstoerungskraft, von, lawinen, on, the, destructive, force, of, avalanches, voellmy, used, a, simple, empirical, formula, treating, an, avalanche, as, a, sliding, block, of, snow, moving, with, a, drag, force, that, was, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, speed, of, its, flow, he, and, others, subsequently, derived, other, formulae, that, take, other, factors, into, account, with, the, voellmy, salm, gubler, and, the, perla, cheng, mcclung, models, becoming, most, widely, used, as, simple, tools, to, model, flowing, as, opposed, to, powder, snow, avalanches, since, the, 1990s, many, more, sophisticated, models, have, been, developed, in, europe, much, of, the, recent, work, was, carried, out, as, part, of, the, satsie, avalanche, studies, and, model, validation, in, europe, research, project, supported, by, the, european, commission, which, produced, the, leading, edge, mn2l, model, now, in, use, with, the, service, restauration, des, terrains, en, montagne, mountain, rescue, service, in, france, and, d2fram, dynamical, two, flow, regime, avalanche, model, which, was, still, undergoing, validation, as, of, 2007, other, known, models, are, the, samos, at, avalanche, simulation, software, and, the, ramms, software, preventative, measures, are, employed, in, areas, where, avalanches, pose, a, significant, threat, to, people, such, as, ski, resorts, mountain, towns, roads, and, railways, there, are, several, ways, to, prevent, avalanches, and, lessen, their, power, and, develop, preventative, measures, to, reduce, the, likelihood, and, size, of, avalanches, by, disrupting, the, structure, of, the, snowpack, while, passive, measures, reinforce, and, stabilize, the, snowpack, in, situ, the, simplest, active, measure, is, repeatedly, traveling, on, a, snowpack, as, snow, accumulates, this, can, be, by, means, of, boot, packing, ski, cutting, or, machine, grooming, explosives, are, used, extensively, to, prevent, avalanches, by, triggering, smaller, avalanches, that, break, down, instabilities, in, the, snowpack, and, removing, overburden, that, can, result, in, larger, avalanches, explosive, charges, are, delivered, by, a, number, of, methods, including, hand, tossed, charges, helicopter, dropped, bombs, gazex, concussion, lines, and, ballistic, projectiles, launched, by, air, cannons, and, artillery, passive, preventive, systems, such, as, snow, fences, and, light, walls, can, be, used, to, direct, the, placement, of, snow, snow, builds, up, around, the, fence, especially, the, side, that, faces, the, prevailing, winds, downwind, of, the, fence, snow, build, up, is, lessened, this, is, caused, by, the, loss, of, snow, at, the, fence, that, would, have, been, deposited, and, the, pickup, of, the, snow, that, is, already, there, by, the, wind, which, was, depleted, of, snow, at, the, fence, when, there, is, a, sufficient, density, of, trees, they, can, greatly, reduce, the, strength, of, avalanches, they, hold, snow, in, place, and, when, there, is, an, avalanche, the, impact, of, the, snow, against, the, trees, slows, it, down, trees, can, either, be, planted, or, they, can, be, conserved, such, as, in, the, building, of, a, ski, resort, to, reduce, the, strength, of, avalanches, in, turn, socio, environmental, changes, can, influence, the, occurrence, of, damaging, avalanches, some, studies, linking, changes, in, land, use, land, cover, patterns, and, the, evolution, of, snow, avalanche, damage, in, mid, latitude, mountains, show, the, importance, of, the, role, played, by, vegetation, cover, that, is, at, the, root, of, the, increase, of, damage, when, the, protective, forest, is, deforested, because, of, demographic, growth, intensive, grazing, and, industrial, or, legal, causes, and, at, the, root, of, the, decrease, of, damage, because, of, the, transformation, of, a, traditional, land, management, system, based, on, overexploitation, into, a, system, based, on, land, marginalization, and, reforestation, something, that, has, happened, mainly, since, the, mid, 20th, century, in, mountain, environments, of, developed, countries, in, many, areas, regular, avalanche, tracks, can, be, identified, and, precautions, can, be, taken, to, minimize, damage, such, as, the, prevention, of, development, in, these, areas, to, mitigate, the, effect, of, avalanches, the, construction, of, artificial, barriers, can, be, very, effective, in, reducing, avalanche, damage, there, are, several, types, one, kind, of, barrier, snow, net, uses, a, net, strung, between, poles, that, are, anchored, by, guy, wires, in, addition, to, their, foundations, these, barriers, are, similar, to, those, used, for, rockslides, another, type, of, barrier, is, a, rigid, fence, like, structure, snow, fence, and, may, be, constructed, of, steel, wood, or, pre, stressed, concrete, they, usually, have, gaps, between, the, beams, and, are, built, perpendicular, to, the, slope, with, reinforcing, beams, on, the, downhill, side, rigid, barriers, are, often, considered, unsightly, especially, when, many, rows, must, be, built, they, are, also, expensive, and, vulnerable, to, damage, from, falling, rocks, in, the, warmer, months, in, addition, to, industrially, manufactured, barriers, landscaped, barriers, called, avalanche, dams, stop, or, deflect, avalanches, with, their, weight, and, strength, these, barriers, are, made, out, of, concrete, rocks, or, earth, they, are, usually, placed, right, above, the, structure, road, or, railway, that, they, are, trying, to, protect, although, they, can, also, be, used, to, channel, avalanches, into, other, barriers, occasionally, earth, mounds, are, placed, in, the, avalanche, s, path, to, slow, it, down, finally, along, transportation, corridors, large, shelters, called, snow, sheds, can, be, built, directly, in, the, slide, path, of, an, avalanche, to, protect, traffic, from, avalanches, warning, systems, can, detect, avalanches, which, develop, slowly, such, as, ice, avalanches, caused, by, icefalls, from, glaciers, interferometric, radars, high, resolution, cameras, or, motion, sensors, can, monitor, instable, areas, over, a, long, term, lasting, from, days, to, years, experts, interpret, the, recorded, data, and, are, able, to, recognize, upcoming, ruptures, in, order, to, initiate, appropriate, measures, such, systems, e, g, the, monitoring, of, the, weissmies, glacier, in, switzerland, can, recognize, events, several, days, in, advance, modern, radar, technology, enables, the, monitoring, of, large, areas, and, the, localization, of, avalanches, at, any, weather, condition, by, day, and, by, night, complex, alarm, systems, are, able, to, detect, avalanches, within, a, short, time, in, order, to, close, e, g, roads, and, rails, or, evacuate, e, g, construction, sites, endangered, areas, an, example, of, such, a, system, is, installed, on, the, only, access, road, of, zermatt, in, switzerland, two, radars, monitor, the, slope, of, a, mountain, above, the, road, the, system, automatically, closes, the, road, by, activating, several, barriers, and, traffic, lights, within, seconds, such, that, no, people, are, harmed, avalanche, accidents, are, broadly, differentiated, into, 2, categories, accidents, in, recreational, settings, and, accidents, in, residential, industrial, and, transportation, settings, this, distinction, is, motivated, by, the, observed, difference, in, the, causes, of, avalanche, accidents, in, the, two, settings, in, the, recreational, setting, most, accidents, are, caused, by, the, people, involved, in, the, avalanche, in, a, 1996, study, jamieson, et, al, pages, 7, 20, found, that, 83, of, all, avalanches, in, the, recreational, setting, were, caused, by, those, who, were, involved, in, the, accident, in, contrast, all, the, accidents, in, the, residential, industrial, and, transportation, settings, were, due, to, spontaneous, natural, avalanches, because, of, the, difference, in, the, causes, of, avalanche, accidents, and, the, activities, pursued, in, the, two, settings, avalanche, and, disaster, management, professionals, have, developed, two, related, preparedness, rescue, and, recovery, strategies, for, each, of, the, settings, two, avalanches, occurred, in, march, 1910, in, the, cascade, and, selkirk, mountain, ranges, on, 1, march, the, wellington, avalanche, killed, 96, in, washington, state, united, states, three, days, later, 62, railroad, workers, were, killed, in, the, rogers, pass, avalanche, in, british, columbia, canada, during, world, war, i, an, estimated, 40, 000, to, 80, 000, soldiers, died, as, a, result, of, avalanches, during, the, mountain, campaign, in, the, alps, at, the, austrian, italian, front, many, of, which, were, caused, by, artillery, fire, some, 10, 000, men, from, both, sides, died, in, avalanches, in, december, 1916, in, the, northern, hemisphere, winter, of, 1950, 1951, approximately, 649, avalanches, were, recorded, in, a, three, month, period, throughout, the, alps, in, austria, france, switzerland, italy, and, germany, this, series, of, avalanches, killed, around, 265, people, and, was, termed, the, winter, of, terror, a, mountain, climbing, camp, on, lenin, peak, in, what, is, now, kyrgyzstan, was, wiped, out, in, 1990, when, an, earthquake, triggered, a, large, avalanche, that, overran, the, camp, forty, three, climbers, were, killed, in, 1993, the, bayburt, zengili, avalanche, killed, 60, individuals, in, zengili, in, the, province, of, bayburt, turkey, a, large, avalanche, in, montroc, france, in, 1999, 300, 000, cubic, metres, of, snow, slid, on, a, 30, slope, achieving, a, speed, in, the, region, of, 100, km, h, 62, mph, it, killed, 12, people, in, their, chalets, under, 100, 000, tons, of, snow, 5, meters, 16, feet, deep, the, mayor, of, chamonix, was, convicted, of, second, degree, murder, for, not, evacuating, the, area, but, received, a, suspended, sentence, the, small, austrian, village, of, galt, r, was, hit, by, the, galt, r, avalanche, in, 1999, the, village, was, thought, to, be, in, a, safe, zone, but, the, avalanche, was, exceptionally, large, and, flowed, into, the, village, thirty, one, people, died, on, 1, december, 2000, the, glory, bowl, avalanche, formed, on, mt, glory, which, is, located, within, the, teton, mountain, range, in, wyoming, united, states, joel, roof, was, snowboarding, recreationally, in, this, backcountry, bowl, shaped, run, and, triggered, the, avalanche, he, was, carried, nearly, 2, 000, feet, to, the, base, of, the, mountain, and, was, not, successfully, rescued, on, 28, january, 2003, the, tatra, mountains, avalanche, swept, away, nine, out, of, a, thirteen, member, group, heading, to, the, summit, of, rysy, in, the, tatra, mountains, the, participants, of, the, trip, were, students, from, the, i, leon, kruczkowski, high, school, in, tychy, and, individuals, associated, with, the, school, s, sports, club, on, 3, july, 2022, a, serac, collapsed, on, the, marmolada, glacier, italy, causing, an, avalanche, that, killed, 11, alpinists, and, injured, eight, in, europe, the, avalanche, risk, is, widely, rated, on, the, following, scale, which, was, adopted, in, april, 1993, to, replace, the, earlier, non, standard, national, schemes, descriptions, were, last, updated, in, may, 2003, to, enhance, uniformity, in, france, most, avalanche, deaths, occur, at, risk, levels, 3, and, 4, in, switzerland, most, occur, at, levels, 2, and, 3, it, is, thought, that, this, may, be, due, to, national, differences, of, interpretation, when, assessing, the, risks, stability, additional, load, gradient, avalanche, size, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, following, avalanche, danger, scale, is, used, descriptors, vary, depending, on, country, there, are, nine, different, types, of, avalanche, problems, the, canadian, classification, for, avalanche, size, is, based, upon, the, consequences, of, the, avalanche, half, sizes, are, commonly, used, the, size, of, avalanches, are, classified, using, two, scales, size, relative, to, destructive, force, or, d, scale, and, size, relative, to, the, avalanche, path, or, r, scale, both, size, scales, range, from, 1, to, 5, with, the, d, size, scale, half, sizes, can, be, used, slab, avalanche, hazard, analysis, can, be, done, using, the, rutschblock, test, a, 2, m, wide, block, of, snow, is, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, slope, and, progressively, loaded, the, result, is, a, rating, of, slope, stability, on, a, seven, step, scale, rutsch, means, slide, in, german, avalanche, formation, and, frequency, is, highly, affected, by, weather, patterns, and, the, local, climate, snowpack, layers, will, form, differently, depending, on, whether, snow, is, falling, in, very, cold, or, very, warm, conditions, and, very, dry, or, very, humid, conditions, thus, climate, change, may, affect, when, where, and, how, often, avalanches, occur, and, may, also, change, the, type, of, avalanches, that, are, occurring, overall, a, rising, seasonal, snow, line, and, a, decrease, in, the, number, of, days, with, snow, cover, are, predicted, climate, change, caused, temperature, increases, and, changes, in, precipitation, patterns, will, likely, differ, between, the, different, mountain, regions, and, the, impacts, of, these, changes, on, avalanches, will, change, at, different, elevations, in, the, long, term, avalanche, frequency, at, lower, elevations, is, expected, to, decline, corresponding, to, a, decrease, in, snow, cover, and, depth, and, a, short, term, increase, in, the, number, of, wet, avalanches, are, predicted, precipitation, is, expected, to, increase, meaning, more, snow, or, rain, depending, on, the, elevation, higher, elevations, predicted, to, remain, above, the, seasonal, snow, line, will, likely, see, an, increase, in, avalanche, activity, due, to, the, increases, in, precipitation, during, the, winter, season, storm, precipitation, intensity, is, also, expected, to, increase, which, is, likely, to, lead, to, more, days, with, enough, snowfall, to, cause, the, snowpack, to, become, unstable, moderate, and, high, elevations, may, see, an, increase, in, volatile, swings, from, one, weather, extreme, to, the, other, predictions, also, show, an, increase, in, the, number, of, rain, on, snow, events, and, wet, avalanche, cycles, occurring, earlier, in, the, spring, during, the, remainder, of, this, century, the, warm, wet, snowpacks, that, are, likely, to, increase, in, frequency, due, to, climate, change, may, also, make, avalanche, burials, more, deadly, warm, snow, has, a, higher, moisture, content, and, is, therefore, denser, than, colder, snow, denser, avalanche, debris, decreases, the, ability, for, a, buried, person, to, breath, and, the, amount, of, time, they, have, before, they, run, out, of, oxygen, this, increases, the, likelihood, of, death, by, asphyxia, in, the, event, of, a, burial, additionally, the, predicted, thinner, snowpacks, may, increase, the, frequency, of, injuries, due, to, trauma, such, as, a, buried, skier, striking, a, rock, or, tree
