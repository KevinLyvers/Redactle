weather, forecasting, is, the, application, of, science, and, technology, to, predict, the, conditions, of, the, atmosphere, for, a, given, location, and, time, people, have, attempted, to, predict, the, weather, informally, for, millennia, and, formally, since, the, 19th, century, weather, forecasts, are, made, by, collecting, quantitative, data, about, the, current, state, of, the, atmosphere, land, and, ocean, and, using, meteorology, to, project, how, the, atmosphere, will, change, at, a, given, place, once, calculated, manually, based, mainly, upon, changes, in, barometric, pressure, current, weather, conditions, and, sky, conditions, or, cloud, cover, weather, forecasting, now, relies, on, computer, based, models, that, take, many, atmospheric, factors, into, account, human, input, is, still, required, to, pick, the, best, possible, model, to, base, the, forecast, upon, which, involves, pattern, recognition, skills, teleconnections, knowledge, of, model, performance, and, knowledge, of, model, biases, the, inaccuracy, of, forecasting, is, due, to, the, chaotic, nature, of, the, atmosphere, the, massive, computational, power, required, to, solve, the, equations, that, describe, the, atmosphere, the, land, and, the, ocean, the, error, involved, in, measuring, the, initial, conditions, and, an, incomplete, understanding, of, atmospheric, and, related, processes, hence, forecasts, become, less, accurate, as, the, difference, between, the, current, time, and, the, time, for, which, the, forecast, is, being, made, the, range, of, the, forecast, increases, the, use, of, ensembles, and, model, consensus, helps, narrow, the, error, and, provide, confidence, in, the, forecast, there, is, a, vast, variety, of, end, uses, for, weather, forecasts, weather, warnings, are, important, because, they, are, used, to, protect, lives, and, property, forecasts, based, on, temperature, and, precipitation, are, important, to, agriculture, and, therefore, to, traders, within, commodity, markets, temperature, forecasts, are, used, by, utility, companies, to, estimate, demand, over, coming, days, on, an, everyday, basis, many, people, use, weather, forecasts, to, determine, what, to, wear, on, a, given, day, since, outdoor, activities, are, severely, curtailed, by, heavy, rain, snow, and, wind, chill, forecasts, can, be, used, to, plan, activities, around, these, events, and, to, plan, ahead, and, survive, them, weather, forecasting, is, a, part, of, the, economy, for, example, in, 2009, the, us, spent, approximately, 5, 8, billion, on, it, producing, benefits, estimated, at, six, times, as, much, in, 650, bc, the, babylonians, predicted, the, weather, from, cloud, patterns, as, well, as, astrology, in, about, 350, bc, aristotle, described, weather, patterns, in, meteorologica, later, theophrastus, compiled, a, book, on, weather, forecasting, called, the, book, of, signs, chinese, weather, prediction, lore, extends, at, least, as, far, back, as, 300, bc, which, was, also, around, the, same, time, ancient, indian, astronomers, developed, weather, prediction, methods, in, the, new, testament, jesus, is, quoted, as, referring, to, deciphering, and, understanding, local, weather, patterns, by, saying, when, evening, comes, you, say, it, will, be, fair, weather, for, the, sky, is, red, and, in, the, morning, today, it, will, be, stormy, for, the, sky, is, red, and, overcast, you, know, how, to, interpret, the, appearance, of, the, sky, but, you, cannot, interpret, the, signs, of, the, times, in, 904, ad, ibn, wahshiyya, s, nabatean, agriculture, translated, into, arabic, from, an, earlier, aramaic, work, discussed, the, weather, forecasting, of, atmospheric, changes, and, signs, from, the, planetary, astral, alterations, signs, of, rain, based, on, observation, of, the, lunar, phases, and, weather, forecasts, based, on, the, movement, of, winds, ancient, weather, forecasting, methods, usually, relied, on, observed, patterns, of, events, also, termed, pattern, recognition, for, example, it, was, observed, that, if, the, sunset, was, particularly, red, the, following, day, often, brought, fair, weather, this, experience, accumulated, over, the, generations, to, produce, weather, lore, however, not, all, of, these, predictions, prove, reliable, and, many, of, them, have, since, been, found, not, to, stand, up, to, rigorous, statistical, testing, it, was, not, until, the, invention, of, the, electric, telegraph, in, 1835, that, the, modern, age, of, weather, forecasting, began, before, that, the, fastest, that, distant, weather, reports, could, travel, was, around, 160, kilometres, per, day, 100, mi, d, but, was, more, typically, 60, 120, kilometres, per, day, 40, 75, mi, day, whether, by, land, or, by, sea, by, the, late, 1840s, the, telegraph, allowed, reports, of, weather, conditions, from, a, wide, area, to, be, received, almost, instantaneously, allowing, forecasts, to, be, made, from, knowledge, of, weather, conditions, further, upwind, the, two, men, credited, with, the, birth, of, forecasting, as, a, science, were, an, officer, of, the, royal, navy, francis, beaufort, and, his, prot, g, robert, fitzroy, both, were, influential, men, in, british, naval, and, governmental, circles, and, though, ridiculed, in, the, press, at, the, time, their, work, gained, scientific, credence, was, accepted, by, the, royal, navy, and, formed, the, basis, for, all, of, today, s, weather, forecasting, knowledge, beaufort, developed, the, wind, force, scale, and, weather, notation, coding, which, he, was, to, use, in, his, journals, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, he, also, promoted, the, development, of, reliable, tide, tables, around, british, shores, and, with, his, friend, william, whewell, expanded, weather, record, keeping, at, 200, british, coast, guard, stations, robert, fitzroy, was, appointed, in, 1854, as, chief, of, a, new, department, within, the, board, of, trade, to, deal, with, the, collection, of, weather, data, at, sea, as, a, service, to, mariners, this, was, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, meteorological, office, all, ship, captains, were, tasked, with, collating, data, on, the, weather, and, computing, it, with, the, use, of, tested, instruments, that, were, loaned, for, this, purpose, a, storm, in, october, 1859, that, caused, the, loss, of, the, royal, charter, inspired, fitzroy, to, develop, charts, to, allow, predictions, to, be, made, which, he, called, forecasting, the, weather, thus, coining, the, term, weather, forecast, fifteen, land, stations, were, established, to, use, the, telegraph, to, transmit, to, him, daily, reports, of, weather, at, set, times, leading, to, the, first, gale, warning, service, his, warning, service, for, shipping, was, initiated, in, february, 1861, with, the, use, of, telegraph, communications, the, first, daily, weather, forecasts, were, published, in, the, times, in, 1861, in, the, following, year, a, system, was, introduced, of, hoisting, storm, warning, cones, at, the, principal, ports, when, a, gale, was, expected, the, weather, book, which, fitzroy, published, in, 1863, was, far, in, advance, of, the, scientific, opinion, of, the, time, as, the, electric, telegraph, network, expanded, allowing, for, the, more, rapid, dissemination, of, warnings, a, national, observational, network, was, developed, which, could, then, be, used, to, provide, synoptic, analyses, to, shorten, detailed, weather, reports, into, more, affordable, telegrams, senders, encoded, weather, information, in, telegraphic, code, such, as, the, one, developed, by, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, instruments, to, continuously, record, variations, in, meteorological, parameters, using, photography, were, supplied, to, the, observing, stations, from, kew, observatory, these, cameras, had, been, invented, by, francis, ronalds, in, 1845, and, his, barograph, had, earlier, been, used, by, fitzroy, to, convey, accurate, information, it, soon, became, necessary, to, have, a, standard, vocabulary, describing, clouds, this, was, achieved, by, means, of, a, series, of, classifications, first, achieved, by, luke, howard, in, 1802, and, standardized, in, the, international, cloud, atlas, of, 1896, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, advances, in, the, understanding, of, atmospheric, physics, led, to, the, foundation, of, modern, numerical, weather, prediction, in, 1922, english, scientist, lewis, fry, richardson, published, weather, prediction, by, numerical, process, after, finding, notes, and, derivations, he, worked, on, as, an, ambulance, driver, in, world, war, i, he, described, therein, how, small, terms, in, the, prognostic, fluid, dynamics, equations, governing, atmospheric, flow, could, be, neglected, and, a, finite, differencing, scheme, in, time, and, space, could, be, devised, to, allow, numerical, prediction, solutions, to, be, found, richardson, envisioned, a, large, auditorium, of, thousands, of, people, performing, the, calculations, and, passing, them, to, others, however, the, sheer, number, of, calculations, required, was, too, large, to, be, completed, without, the, use, of, computers, and, the, size, of, the, grid, and, time, steps, led, to, unrealistic, results, in, deepening, systems, it, was, later, found, through, numerical, analysis, that, this, was, due, to, numerical, instability, the, first, computerised, weather, forecast, was, performed, by, a, team, composed, of, american, meteorologists, jule, charney, philip, duncan, thompson, larry, gates, and, norwegian, meteorologist, ragnar, fj, rtoft, applied, mathematician, john, von, neumann, and, eniac, programmer, klara, dan, von, neumann, practical, use, of, numerical, weather, prediction, began, in, 1955, spurred, by, the, development, of, programmable, electronic, computers, the, first, ever, daily, weather, forecasts, were, published, in, the, times, on, august, 1, 1861, and, the, first, weather, maps, were, produced, later, in, the, same, year, in, 1911, the, met, office, began, issuing, the, first, marine, weather, forecasts, via, radio, transmission, these, included, gale, and, storm, warnings, for, areas, around, great, britain, in, the, united, states, the, first, public, radio, forecasts, were, made, in, 1925, by, edward, b, e, b, rideout, on, weei, the, edison, electric, illuminating, station, in, boston, rideout, came, from, the, u, s, weather, bureau, as, did, wbz, weather, forecaster, g, harold, noyes, in, 1931, the, world, s, first, televised, weather, forecasts, including, the, use, of, weather, maps, were, experimentally, broadcast, by, the, bbc, in, november, 1936, this, was, brought, into, practice, in, 1949, after, world, war, ii, george, cowling, gave, the, first, weather, forecast, while, being, televised, in, front, of, the, map, in, 1954, in, america, experimental, television, forecasts, were, made, by, james, c, fidler, in, cincinnati, in, either, 1940, or, 1947, on, the, dumont, television, network, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, john, coleman, the, first, weatherman, for, the, american, broadcasting, company, abc, s, good, morning, america, pioneered, the, use, of, on, screen, weather, satellite, data, and, computer, graphics, for, television, forecasts, in, 1982, coleman, partnered, with, landmark, communications, ceo, frank, batten, to, launch, the, weather, channel, twc, a, 24, hour, cable, network, devoted, to, national, and, local, weather, reports, some, weather, channels, have, started, broadcasting, on, live, streaming, platforms, such, as, youtube, and, periscope, to, reach, more, viewers, the, basic, idea, of, numerical, weather, prediction, is, to, sample, the, state, of, the, fluid, at, a, given, time, and, use, the, equations, of, fluid, dynamics, and, thermodynamics, to, estimate, the, state, of, the, fluid, at, some, time, in, the, future, the, main, inputs, from, country, based, weather, services, are, surface, observations, from, automated, weather, stations, at, ground, level, over, land, and, from, weather, buoys, at, sea, the, world, meteorological, organization, acts, to, standardize, the, instrumentation, observing, practices, and, timing, of, these, observations, worldwide, stations, either, report, hourly, in, metar, reports, or, every, six, hours, in, synop, reports, sites, launch, radiosondes, which, rise, through, the, depth, of, the, troposphere, and, well, into, the, stratosphere, data, from, weather, satellites, are, used, in, areas, where, traditional, data, sources, are, not, available, compared, with, similar, data, from, radiosondes, the, satellite, data, has, the, advantage, of, global, coverage, but, at, a, lower, accuracy, and, resolution, meteorological, radar, provide, information, on, precipitation, location, and, intensity, which, can, be, used, to, estimate, precipitation, accumulations, over, time, additionally, if, a, pulse, doppler, weather, radar, is, used, then, wind, speed, and, direction, can, be, determined, these, methods, however, leave, an, in, situ, observational, gap, in, the, lower, atmosphere, from, 100, m, to, 6, km, above, ground, level, to, reduce, this, gap, in, the, late, 1990s, weather, drones, started, to, be, considered, for, obtaining, data, from, those, altitudes, research, has, been, growing, significantly, since, the, 2010s, and, weather, drone, data, may, in, future, be, added, to, numerical, weather, models, commerce, provides, pilot, reports, along, aircraft, routes, and, ship, reports, along, shipping, routes, research, flights, using, reconnaissance, aircraft, fly, in, and, around, weather, systems, of, interest, such, as, tropical, cyclones, reconnaissance, aircraft, are, also, flown, over, the, open, oceans, during, the, cold, season, into, systems, that, cause, significant, uncertainty, in, forecast, guidance, or, are, expected, to, be, of, high, impact, three, seven, days, into, the, future, over, the, downstream, continent, models, are, initialized, using, this, observed, data, the, irregularly, spaced, observations, are, processed, by, data, assimilation, and, objective, analysis, methods, which, perform, quality, control, and, obtain, values, at, locations, usable, by, the, model, s, mathematical, algorithms, usually, an, evenly, spaced, grid, the, data, are, then, used, in, the, model, as, the, starting, point, for, a, forecast, commonly, the, set, of, equations, used, to, predict, the, physics, and, dynamics, of, the, atmosphere, are, called, primitive, equations, these, are, initialized, from, the, analysis, data, and, rates, of, change, are, determined, the, rates, of, change, predict, the, state, of, the, atmosphere, a, short, time, into, the, future, the, equations, are, then, applied, to, this, new, atmospheric, state, to, find, new, rates, of, change, which, predict, the, atmosphere, at, a, yet, further, time, into, the, future, this, time, stepping, procedure, is, continually, repeated, until, the, solution, reaches, the, desired, forecast, time, the, length, of, the, time, step, chosen, within, the, model, is, related, to, the, distance, between, the, points, on, the, computational, grid, and, is, chosen, to, maintain, numerical, stability, time, steps, for, global, models, are, on, the, order, of, tens, of, minutes, while, time, steps, for, regional, models, are, between, one, and, four, minutes, the, global, models, are, run, at, varying, times, into, the, future, the, met, office, s, unified, model, is, run, six, days, into, the, future, the, european, centre, for, medium, range, weather, forecasts, model, is, run, out, to, 10, days, into, the, future, while, the, global, forecast, system, model, run, by, the, environmental, modeling, center, is, run, 16, days, into, the, future, the, visual, output, produced, by, a, model, solution, is, known, as, a, prognostic, chart, or, prog, the, raw, output, is, often, modified, before, being, presented, as, the, forecast, this, can, be, in, the, form, of, statistical, techniques, to, remove, known, biases, in, the, model, or, of, adjustment, to, take, into, account, consensus, among, other, numerical, weather, forecasts, mos, or, model, output, statistics, is, a, technique, used, to, interpret, numerical, model, output, and, produce, site, specific, guidance, this, guidance, is, presented, in, coded, numerical, form, and, can, be, obtained, for, nearly, all, national, weather, service, reporting, stations, in, the, united, states, as, proposed, by, edward, lorenz, in, 1963, long, range, forecasts, those, made, at, a, range, of, two, weeks, or, more, cannot, definitively, predict, the, state, of, the, atmosphere, owing, to, the, chaotic, nature, of, the, fluid, dynamics, equations, involved, in, numerical, models, extremely, small, errors, in, initial, values, double, roughly, every, five, days, for, variables, such, as, temperature, and, wind, velocity, essentially, a, model, is, a, computer, program, that, produces, meteorological, information, for, future, times, at, given, locations, and, altitudes, within, any, modern, model, is, a, set, of, equations, known, as, the, primitive, equations, used, to, predict, the, future, state, of, the, atmosphere, these, equations, along, with, the, ideal, gas, law, are, used, to, evolve, the, density, pressure, and, potential, temperature, scalar, fields, and, the, velocity, vector, field, of, the, atmosphere, through, time, additional, transport, equations, for, pollutants, and, other, aerosols, are, included, in, some, primitive, equation, mesoscale, models, as, well, the, equations, used, are, nonlinear, partial, differential, equations, which, are, impossible, to, solve, exactly, through, analytical, methods, with, the, exception, of, a, few, idealized, cases, therefore, numerical, methods, obtain, approximate, solutions, different, models, use, different, solution, methods, some, global, models, use, spectral, methods, for, the, horizontal, dimensions, and, finite, difference, methods, for, the, vertical, dimension, while, regional, and, other, global, models, usually, use, finite, difference, methods, in, all, three, dimensions, the, simplest, method, of, forecasting, the, weather, persistence, relies, upon, today, s, conditions, to, forecast, tomorrow, s, this, can, be, valid, when, the, weather, achieves, a, steady, state, such, as, during, the, summer, season, in, the, tropics, this, method, strongly, depends, upon, the, presence, of, a, stagnant, weather, pattern, therefore, when, in, a, fluctuating, pattern, it, becomes, inaccurate, it, can, be, useful, in, both, short, and, long, range, forecast, long, range, forecasts, measurements, of, barometric, pressure, and, the, pressure, tendency, the, change, of, pressure, over, time, have, been, used, in, forecasting, since, the, late, 19th, century, the, larger, the, change, in, pressure, especially, if, more, than, 3, 5, hpa, 2, 6, mmhg, the, larger, the, change, in, weather, can, be, expected, if, the, pressure, drop, is, rapid, a, low, pressure, system, is, approaching, and, there, is, a, greater, chance, of, rain, rapid, pressure, rises, are, associated, with, improving, weather, conditions, such, as, clearing, skies, along, with, pressure, tendency, the, condition, of, the, sky, is, one, of, the, more, important, parameters, used, to, forecast, weather, in, mountainous, areas, thickening, of, cloud, cover, or, the, invasion, of, a, higher, cloud, deck, is, indicative, of, rain, in, the, near, future, high, thin, cirrostratus, clouds, can, create, halos, around, the, sun, or, moon, which, indicates, an, approach, of, a, warm, front, and, its, associated, rain, morning, fog, portends, fair, conditions, as, rainy, conditions, are, preceded, by, wind, or, clouds, that, prevent, fog, formation, the, approach, of, a, line, of, thunderstorms, could, indicate, the, approach, of, a, cold, front, cloud, free, skies, are, indicative, of, fair, weather, for, the, near, future, a, bar, can, indicate, a, coming, tropical, cyclone, the, use, of, sky, cover, in, weather, prediction, has, led, to, various, weather, lore, over, the, centuries, the, forecasting, of, the, weather, for, the, following, six, hours, is, often, referred, to, as, nowcasting, in, this, time, range, it, is, possible, to, forecast, smaller, features, such, as, individual, showers, and, thunderstorms, with, reasonable, accuracy, as, well, as, other, features, too, small, to, be, resolved, by, a, computer, model, a, human, given, the, latest, radar, satellite, and, observational, data, will, be, able, to, make, a, better, analysis, of, the, small, scale, features, present, and, so, will, be, able, to, make, a, more, accurate, forecast, for, the, following, few, hours, however, there, are, now, expert, systems, using, those, data, and, mesoscale, numerical, model, to, make, better, extrapolation, including, evolution, of, those, features, in, time, accuweather, is, known, for, a, minute, cast, which, is, a, minute, by, minute, precipitation, forecast, for, the, next, two, hours, in, the, past, human, forecasters, were, responsible, for, generating, the, weather, forecast, based, upon, available, observations, today, human, input, is, generally, confined, to, choosing, a, model, based, on, various, parameters, such, as, model, biases, and, performance, using, a, consensus, of, forecast, models, as, well, as, ensemble, members, of, the, various, models, can, help, reduce, forecast, error, however, regardless, how, small, the, average, error, becomes, with, any, individual, system, large, errors, within, any, particular, piece, of, guidance, are, still, possible, on, any, given, model, run, humans, are, required, to, interpret, the, model, data, into, weather, forecasts, that, are, understandable, to, the, end, user, humans, can, use, knowledge, of, local, effects, that, may, be, too, small, in, size, to, be, resolved, by, the, model, to, add, information, to, the, forecast, while, increasing, accuracy, of, forecasting, models, implies, that, humans, may, no, longer, be, needed, in, the, forecasting, process, at, some, point, in, the, future, there, is, currently, still, a, need, for, human, intervention, the, analog, technique, is, a, complex, way, of, making, a, forecast, requiring, the, forecaster, to, remember, a, previous, weather, event, that, is, expected, to, be, mimicked, by, an, upcoming, event, what, makes, it, a, difficult, technique, to, use, is, that, there, is, rarely, a, perfect, analog, for, an, event, in, the, future, some, call, this, type, of, forecasting, pattern, recognition, it, remains, a, useful, method, of, observing, rainfall, over, data, voids, such, as, oceans, as, well, as, the, forecasting, of, precipitation, amounts, and, distribution, in, the, future, a, similar, technique, is, used, in, medium, range, forecasting, which, is, known, as, teleconnections, when, systems, in, other, locations, are, used, to, help, pin, down, the, location, of, another, system, within, the, surrounding, regime, an, example, of, teleconnections, are, by, using, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, related, phenomena, initial, attempts, to, use, artificial, intelligence, began, in, the, 2010s, huawei, s, pangu, weather, model, google, s, graphcast, windborne, s, weathermesh, model, nvidia, s, fourcastnet, and, the, european, centre, for, medium, range, weather, forecasts, artificial, intelligence, integrated, forecasting, system, or, aifs, all, appeared, in, 2022, 2023, in, 2024, aifs, started, to, publish, real, time, forecasts, showing, specific, skill, at, predicting, hurricane, tracks, but, lower, performing, on, the, intensity, changes, of, such, storms, relative, to, physics, based, models, such, models, use, no, physics, based, atmosphere, modeling, or, large, language, models, instead, they, learn, purely, from, data, such, as,

lightning, strikes, that, can, lead, to, deaths, power, outages, and, widespread, hail, damage, heavy, snow, or, rain, can, bring, transportation, and, commerce, to, a, stand, still, as, well, as, cause, flooding, in, low, lying, areas, excessive, heat, or, cold, waves, can, sicken, or, kill, those, with, inadequate, utilities, and, droughts, can, impact, water, usage, and, destroy, vegetation, several, countries, employ, government, agencies, to, provide, forecasts, and, watches, warnings, advisories, to, the, public, to, protect, life, and, property, and, maintain, commercial, interests, knowledge, of, what, the, end, user, needs, from, a, weather, forecast, must, be, taken, into, account, to, present, the, information, in, a, useful, and, understandable, way, examples, include, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, s, national, weather, service, nws, and, environment, canada, s, meteorological, service, msc, traditionally, newspaper, television, and, radio, have, been, the, primary, outlets, for, presenting, weather, forecast, information, to, the, public, in, addition, some, cities, had, weather, beacons, increasingly, the, internet, is, being, used, due, to, the, vast, amount, of, specific, information, that, can, be, found, in, all, cases, these, outlets, update, their, forecasts, on, a, regular, basis, a, major, part, of, modern, weather, forecasting, is, the, severe, weather, alerts, and, advisories, that, the, national, weather, services, issue, in, the, case, that, severe, or, hazardous, weather, is, expected, this, is, done, to, protect, life, and, property, some, of, the, most, commonly, known, of, severe, weather, advisories, are, the, severe, thunderstorm, and, tornado, warning, as, well, as, the, severe, thunderstorm, and, tornado, watch, other, forms, of, these, advisories, include, winter, weather, high, wind, flood, tropical, cyclone, and, fog, severe, weather, advisories, and, alerts, are, broadcast, through, the, media, including, radio, using, emergency, systems, as, the, emergency, alert, system, which, break, into, regular, programming, the, low, temperature, forecast, for, the, current, day, is, calculated, using, the, lowest, temperature, found, between, 7, pm, that, evening, through, 7, am, the, following, morning, so, in, short, today, s, forecasted, low, is, most, likely, tomorrow, s, low, temperature, there, are, a, number, of, sectors, with, their, own, specific, needs, for, weather, forecasts, and, specialist, services, are, provided, to, these, users, as, given, below, because, the, aviation, industry, is, especially, sensitive, to, the, weather, accurate, weather, forecasting, is, essential, fog, or, exceptionally, low, ceilings, can, prevent, many, aircraft, from, landing, and, taking, off, turbulence, and, icing, are, also, significant, in, flight, hazards, thunderstorms, are, a, problem, for, all, aircraft, because, of, severe, turbulence, due, to, their, updrafts, and, outflow, boundaries, icing, due, to, the, heavy, precipitation, as, well, as, large, hail, strong, winds, and, lightning, all, of, which, can, cause, severe, damage, to, an, aircraft, in, flight, volcanic, ash, is, also, a, significant, problem, for, aviation, as, aircraft, can, lose, engine, power, within, ash, clouds, on, a, day, to, day, basis, airliners, are, routed, to, take, advantage, of, the, jet, stream, tailwind, to, improve, fuel, efficiency, aircrews, are, briefed, prior, to, takeoff, on, the, conditions, to, expect, en, route, and, at, their, destination, additionally, airports, often, change, which, runway, is, being, used, to, take, advantage, of, a, headwind, this, reduces, the, distance, required, for, takeoff, and, eliminates, potential, crosswinds, commercial, and, recreational, use, of, waterways, can, be, limited, significantly, by, wind, direction, and, speed, wave, periodicity, and, heights, tides, and, precipitation, these, factors, can, each, influence, the, safety, of, marine, transit, consequently, a, variety, of, codes, have, been, established, to, efficiently, transmit, detailed, marine, weather, forecasts, to, vessel, pilots, via, radio, for, example, the, mafor, marine, forecast, typical, weather, forecasts, can, be, received, at, sea, through, the, use, of, rtty, navtex, and, radiofax, farmers, rely, on, weather, forecasts, to, decide, what, work, to, do, on, any, particular, day, for, example, drying, hay, is, only, feasible, in, dry, weather, prolonged, periods, of, dryness, can, ruin, cotton, wheat, and, corn, crops, while, corn, crops, can, be, ruined, by, drought, their, dried, remains, can, be, used, as, a, cattle, feed, substitute, in, the, form, of, silage, frosts, and, freezes, play, havoc, with, crops, both, during, the, spring, and, fall, for, example, peach, trees, in, full, bloom, can, have, their, potential, peach, crop, decimated, by, a, spring, freeze, orange, groves, can, suffer, significant, damage, during, frosts, and, freezes, regardless, of, their, timing, forecasting, of, wind, precipitation, and, humidity, is, essential, for, preventing, and, controlling, wildfires, indices, such, as, the, forest, fire, weather, index, and, the, haines, index, have, been, developed, to, predict, the, areas, more, at, risk, of, fire, from, natural, or, human, causes, conditions, for, the, development, of, harmful, insects, can, also, be, predicted, by, forecasting, the, weather, electricity, and, gas, companies, rely, on, weather, forecasts, to, anticipate, demand, which, can, be, strongly, affected, by, the, weather, they, use, the, quantity, termed, the, degree, day, to, determine, how, strong, of, a, use, there, will, be, for, heating, heating, degree, day, or, cooling, cooling, degree, day, these, quantities, are, based, on, a, daily, average, temperature, of, 65, f, 18, c, cooler, temperatures, force, heating, degree, days, one, per, degree, fahrenheit, while, warmer, temperatures, force, cooling, degree, days, in, winter, severe, cold, weather, can, cause, a, surge, in, demand, as, people, turn, up, their, heating, similarly, in, summer, a, surge, in, demand, can, be, linked, with, the, increased, use, of, air, conditioning, systems, in, hot, weather, by, anticipating, a, surge, in, demand, utility, companies, can, purchase, additional, supplies, of, power, or, natural, gas, before, the, price, increases, or, in, some, circumstances, supplies, are, restricted, through, the, use, of, brownouts, and, blackouts, increasingly, private, companies, pay, for, weather, forecasts, tailored, to, their, needs, so, that, they, can, increase, their, profits, or, avoid, large, losses, for, example, supermarket, chains, may, change, the, stocks, on, their, shelves, in, anticipation, of, different, consumer, spending, habits, in, different, weather, conditions, weather, forecasts, can, be, used, to, invest, in, the, commodity, market, such, as, futures, in, oranges, corn, soybeans, and, oil, royal, navy, the, uk, royal, navy, working, with, the, uk, met, office, has, its, own, specialist, branch, of, weather, observers, and, forecasters, as, part, of, the, hydrographic, and, meteorological, hm, specialisation, who, monitor, and, forecast, operational, conditions, across, the, globe, to, provide, accurate, and, timely, weather, and, oceanographic, information, to, submarines, ships, and, fleet, air, arm, aircraft, a, mobile, unit, in, the, raf, working, with, the, uk, met, office, forecasts, the, weather, for, regions, in, which, british, allied, servicemen, and, women, are, deployed, a, group, based, at, camp, bastion, provides, forecasts, for, the, british, armed, forces, in, afghanistan, similar, to, the, private, sector, military, weather, forecasters, present, weather, conditions, to, the, war, fighter, community, military, weather, forecasters, provide, pre, flight, and, in, flight, weather, briefs, to, pilots, and, provide, real, time, resource, protection, services, for, military, installations, naval, forecasters, cover, the, waters, and, ship, weather, forecasts, the, united, states, navy, provides, a, special, service, to, both, themselves, and, the, rest, of, the, federal, government, by, issuing, forecasts, for, tropical, cyclones, across, the, pacific, and, indian, oceans, through, their, joint, typhoon, warning, center, within, the, united, states, air, force, weather, provides, weather, forecasting, for, the, air, force, and, the, army, air, force, forecasters, cover, air, operations, in, both, wartime, and, peacetime, operations, and, provide, army, support, united, states, coast, guard, marine, science, technicians, provide, ship, forecasts, for, ice, breakers, and, other, various,
