the, geological, history, of, the, earth, follows, the, major, geological, events, in, earth, s, past, based, on, the, geological, time, scale, a, system, of, chronological, measurement, based, on, the, study, of, the, planet, s, rock, layers, stratigraphy, earth, formed, about, 4, 54, billion, years, ago, by, accretion, from, the, solar, nebula, a, disk, shaped, mass, of, dust, and, gas, left, over, from, the, formation, of, the, sun, which, also, created, the, rest, of, the, solar, system, initially, earth, was, molten, due, to, extreme, volcanism, and, frequent, collisions, with, other, bodies, eventually, the, outer, layer, of, the, planet, cooled, to, form, a, solid, crust, when, water, began, accumulating, in, the, atmosphere, the, moon, formed, soon, afterwards, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, impact, of, a, planetoid, with, the, earth, outgassing, and, volcanic, activity, produced, the, primordial, atmosphere, condensing, water, vapor, augmented, by, ice, delivered, from, comets, produced, the, oceans, however, in, 2020, researchers, reported, that, sufficient, water, to, fill, the, oceans, may, have, always, been, on, the, earth, since, the, beginning, of, the, planet, s, formation, as, the, surface, continually, reshaped, itself, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, continents, formed, and, broke, apart, they, migrated, across, the, surface, occasionally, combining, to, form, a, supercontinent, roughly, 750, million, years, ago, the, earliest, known, supercontinent, rodinia, began, to, break, apart, the, continents, later, recombined, to, form, pannotia, 600, to, 540, million, years, ago, then, finally, pangaea, which, broke, apart, 200, million, years, ago, the, present, pattern, of, ice, ages, began, about, 40, million, years, ago, then, intensified, at, the, end, of, the, pliocene, the, polar, regions, have, since, undergone, repeated, cycles, of, glaciation, and, thawing, repeating, every, 40, 000, 100, 000, years, the, last, glacial, period, of, the, current, ice, age, ended, about, 10, 000, years, ago, the, precambrian, includes, approximately, 90, of, geologic, time, it, extends, from, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, to, the, beginning, of, the, cambrian, period, about, 539, ma, it, includes, the, first, three, of, the, four, eons, of, earth, s, prehistory, the, hadean, archean, and, proterozoic, and, precedes, the, phanerozoic, eon, major, volcanic, events, altering, the, earth, s, environment, and, causing, extinctions, may, have, occurred, 10, times, in, the, past, 3, billion, years, during, hadean, time, 4, 6, 4, ga, the, solar, system, was, forming, probably, within, a, large, cloud, of, gas, and, dust, around, the, sun, called, an, accretion, disc, from, which, earth, formed, 4, 500, million, years, ago, the, hadean, eon, is, not, formally, recognized, but, it, essentially, marks, the, era, before, we, have, adequate, record, of, significant, solid, rocks, the, oldest, dated, zircons, date, from, about, 4, 400, million, years, ago, earth, was, initially, molten, due, to, extreme, volcanism, and, frequent, collisions, with, other, bodies, eventually, the, outer, layer, of, the, planet, cooled, to, form, a, solid, crust, when, water, began, accumulating, in, the, atmosphere, the, moon, formed, soon, afterwards, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, impact, of, a, large, planetoid, with, the, earth, more, recent, potassium, isotopic, studies, suggest, that, the, moon, was, formed, by, a, smaller, high, energy, high, angular, momentum, giant, impact, cleaving, off, a, significant, portion, of, the, earth, some, of, this, object, s, mass, merged, with, earth, significantly, altering, its, internal, composition, and, a, portion, was, ejected, into, space, some, of, the, material, survived, to, form, the, orbiting, moon, outgassing, and, volcanic, activity, produced, the, primordial, atmosphere, condensing, water, vapor, augmented, by, ice, delivered, from, comets, produced, the, oceans, however, in, 2020, researchers, reported, that, sufficient, water, to, fill, the, oceans, may, have, always, been, on, the, earth, since, the, beginning, of, the, planet, s, formation, during, the, hadean, the, late, heavy, bombardment, occurred, approximately, 4, 100, to, 3, 800, million, years, ago, during, which, a, large, number, of, impact, craters, are, believed, to, have, formed, on, the, moon, and, by, inference, on, earth, mercury, venus, and, mars, as, well, however, some, scientists, argue, against, this, hypothetical, late, heavy, bombardment, pointing, out, that, the, conclusion, has, been, drawn, from, data, which, are, not, fully, representative, only, a, few, crater, hotspots, on, the, moon, have, been, analyzed, the, earth, of, the, early, archean, 4, 031, to, 2, 500, million, years, ago, may, have, had, a, different, tectonic, style, during, this, time, the, earth, s, crust, cooled, enough, that, rocks, and, continental, plates, began, to, form, some, scientists, think, because, the, earth, was, hotter, that, plate, tectonic, activity, was, more, vigorous, than, it, is, today, resulting, in, a, much, greater, rate, of, recycling, of, crustal, material, this, may, have, prevented, cratonization, and, continent, formation, until, the, mantle, cooled, and, convection, slowed, down, others, argue, that, the, subcontinental, lithospheric, mantle, is, too, buoyant, to, subduct, and, that, the, lack, of, archean, rocks, is, a, function, of, erosion, and, subsequent, tectonic, events, some, geologists, view, the, sudden, increase, in, aluminum, content, in, zircons, as, an, indicator, of, the, beginning, of, plate, tectonics, in, contrast, to, the, proterozoic, archean, rocks, are, often, heavily, metamorphized, deep, water, sediments, such, as, graywackes, mudstones, volcanic, sediments, and, banded, iron, formations, greenstone, belts, are, typical, archean, formations, consisting, of, alternating, high, and, low, grade, metamorphic, rocks, the, high, grade, rocks, were, derived, from, volcanic, island, arcs, while, the, low, grade, metamorphic, rocks, represent, deep, sea, sediments, eroded, from, the, neighboring, island, rocks, and, deposited, in, a, forearc, basin, in, short, greenstone, belts, represent, sutured, protocontinents, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, was, established, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, the, solar, wind, flux, was, about, 100, times, the, value, of, the, modern, sun, so, the, presence, of, the, magnetic, field, helped, prevent, the, planet, s, atmosphere, from, being, stripped, away, which, is, what, probably, happened, to, the, atmosphere, of, mars, however, the, field, strength, was, lower, than, at, present, and, the, magnetosphere, was, about, half, the, modern, radius, the, geologic, record, of, the, proterozoic, 2, 500, to, 538, 8, million, years, ago, is, more, complete, than, that, for, the, preceding, archean, in, contrast, to, the, deep, water, deposits, of, the, archean, the, proterozoic, features, many, strata, that, were, laid, down, in, extensive, shallow, epicontinental, seas, furthermore, many, of, these, rocks, are, less, metamorphosed, than, archean, age, ones, and, plenty, are, unaltered, study, of, these, rocks, shows, that, the, eon, featured, massive, rapid, continental, accretion, unique, to, the, proterozoic, supercontinent, cycles, and, wholly, modern, orogenic, activity, roughly, 750, million, years, ago, the, earliest, known, supercontinent, rodinia, began, to, break, apart, the, continents, later, recombined, to, form, pannotia, 600, 540, ma, the, first, known, glaciations, occurred, during, the, proterozoic, one, that, began, shortly, after, the, beginning, of, the, eon, while, there, were, at, least, four, during, the, neoproterozoic, climaxing, with, the, snowball, earth, of, the, varangian, glaciation, the, phanerozoic, eon, is, the, current, eon, in, the, geologic, timescale, it, covers, roughly, 539, million, years, during, this, period, continents, drifted, apart, but, eventually, collected, into, a, single, landmass, known, as, pangea, before, splitting, again, into, the, current, continental, landmasses, the, phanerozoic, is, divided, into, three, eras, the, paleozoic, the, mesozoic, and, the, cenozoic, most, of, the, evolution, of, multicellular, life, occurred, during, this, time, period, the, paleozoic, era, spanned, roughly, 539, to, 251, million, years, ago, ma, and, is, subdivided, into, six, geologic, periods, from, oldest, to, youngest, they, are, the, cambrian, ordovician, silurian, devonian, carboniferous, and, permian, geologically, the, paleozoic, starts, shortly, after, the, breakup, of, a, supercontinent, called, pannotia, and, at, the, end, of, a, global, ice, age, throughout, the, early, paleozoic, earth, s, landmass, was, broken, up, into, a, substantial, number, of, relatively, small, continents, toward, the, end, of, the, era, the, continents, gathered, together, into, a, supercontinent, called, pangaea, which, included, most, of, earth, s, land, area, the, cambrian, is, a, major, division, of, the, geologic, timescale, that, begins, about, 538, 8, 0, 2, ma, cambrian, continents, are, thought, to, have, resulted, from, the, breakup, of, a, neoproterozoic, supercontinent, called, pannotia, the, waters, of, the, cambrian, period, appear, to, have, been, widespread, and, shallow, continental, drift, rates, may, have, been, anomalously, high, laurentia, baltica, and, siberia, remained, independent, continents, following, the, break, up, of, the, supercontinent, of, pannotia, gondwana, started, to, drift, toward, the, south, pole, panthalassa, covered, most, of, the, southern, hemisphere, and, minor, oceans, included, the, proto, tethys, ocean, iapetus, ocean, and, khanty, ocean, the, ordovician, period, started, at, a, major, extinction, event, called, the, cambrian, ordovician, extinction, event, some, time, about, 485, 4, 1, 9, ma, during, the, ordovician, the, southern, continents, were, collected, into, a, single, continent, called, gondwana, gondwana, started, the, period, in, the, equatorial, latitudes, and, as, the, period, progressed, drifted, toward, the, south, pole, early, in, the, ordovician, the, continents, laurentia, siberia, and, baltica, were, still, independent, continents, since, the, break, up, of, the, supercontinent, pannotia, earlier, but, baltica, began, to, move, toward, laurentia, later, in, the, period, causing, the, iapetus, ocean, to, shrink, between, them, also, avalonia, broke, free, from, gondwana, and, began, to, head, north, toward, laurentia, the, rheic, ocean, was, formed, as, a, result, of, this, by, the, end, of, the, period, gondwana, had, neared, or, approached, the, pole, and, was, largely, glaciated, the, ordovician, came, to, a, close, in, a, series, of, extinction, events, that, taken, together, comprise, the, second, largest, of, the, five, major, extinction, events, in, earth, s, history, in, terms, of, percentage, of, genera, that, became, extinct, the, only, larger, one, was, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, extinctions, occurred, approximately, 447, to, 444, million, years, ago, and, mark, the, boundary, between, the, ordovician, and, the, following, silurian, period, the, most, commonly, accepted, theory, is, that, these, events, were, triggered, by, the, onset, of, an, ice, age, in, the, hirnantian, faunal, stage, that, ended, the, long, stable, greenhouse, conditions, typical, of, the, ordovician, the, ice, age, was, probably, not, as, long, lasting, as, once, thought, study, of, oxygen, isotopes, in, fossil, brachiopods, shows, that, it, was, probably, no, longer, than, 0, 5, to, 1, 5, million, years, the, event, was, preceded, by, a, fall, in, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, from, 7000ppm, to, 4400ppm, which, selectively, affected, the, shallow, seas, where, most, organisms, lived, as, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, drifted, over, the, south, pole, ice, caps, formed, on, it, evidence, of, these, ice, caps, has, been, detected, in, upper, ordovician, rock, strata, of, north, africa, and, then, adjacent, northeastern, south, america, which, were, south, polar, locations, at, the, time, the, silurian, is, a, major, division, of, the, geologic, timescale, that, started, about, 443, 8, 1, 5, ma, during, the, silurian, gondwana, continued, a, slow, southward, drift, to, high, southern, latitudes, but, there, is, evidence, that, the, silurian, ice, caps, were, less, extensive, than, those, of, the, late, ordovician, glaciation, the, melting, of, ice, caps, and, glaciers, contributed, to, a, rise, in, sea, levels, recognizable, from, the, fact, that, silurian, sediments, overlie, eroded, ordovician, sediments, forming, an, unconformity, other, cratons, and, continent, fragments, drifted, together, near, the, equator, starting, the, formation, of, a, second, supercontinent, known, as, euramerica, the, vast, ocean, of, panthalassa, covered, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, other, minor, oceans, include, proto, tethys, paleo, tethys, rheic, ocean, a, seaway, of, iapetus, ocean, now, in, between, avalonia, and, laurentia, and, newly, formed, ural, ocean, the, devonian, spanned, roughly, from, 419, to, 359, ma, the, period, was, a, time, of, great, tectonic, activity, as, laurasia, and, gondwana, drew, closer, together, the, continent, euramerica, or, laurussia, was, created, in, the, early, devonian, by, the, collision, of, laurentia, and, baltica, which, rotated, into, the, natural, dry, zone, along, the, tropic, of, capricorn, in, these, near, deserts, the, old, red, sandstone, sedimentary, beds, formed, made, red, by, the, oxidized, iron, hematite, characteristic, of, drought, conditions, near, the, equator, pangaea, began, to, consolidate, from, the, plates, containing, north, america, and, europe, further, raising, the, northern, appalachian, mountains, and, forming, the, caledonian, mountains, in, great, britain, and, scandinavia, the, southern, continents, remained, tied, together, in, the, supercontinent, of, gondwana, the, remainder, of, modern, eurasia, lay, in, the, northern, hemisphere, sea, levels, were, high, worldwide, and, much, of, the, land, lay, submerged, under, shallow, seas, the, deep, enormous, panthalassa, the, universal, ocean, covered, the, rest, of, the, planet, other, minor, oceans, were, paleo, tethys, proto, tethys, rheic, ocean, and, ural, ocean, which, was, closed, during, the, collision, with, siberia, and, baltica, the, carboniferous, extends, from, about, 358, 9, 0, 4, to, about, 298, 9, 0, 15, ma, a, global, drop, in, sea, level, at, the, end, of, the, devonian, reversed, early, in, the, carboniferous, this, created, the, widespread, epicontinental, seas, and, carbonate, deposition, of, the, mississippian, there, was, also, a, drop, in, south, polar, temperatures, southern, gondwana, was, glaciated, throughout, the, period, though, it, is, uncertain, if, the, ice, sheets, were, a, holdover, from, the, devonian, or, not, these, conditions, apparently, had, little, effect, in, the, deep, tropics, where, lush, coal, swamps, flourished, within, 30, degrees, of, the, northernmost, glaciers, a, mid, carboniferous, drop, in, sea, level, precipitated, a, major, marine, extinction, one, that, hit, crinoids, and, ammonites, especially, hard, this, sea, level, drop, and, the, associated, unconformity, in, north, america, separate, the, mississippian, period, from, the, pennsylvanian, period, the, carboniferous, was, a, time, of, active, mountain, building, as, the, supercontinent, pangea, came, together, the, southern, continents, remained, tied, together, in, the, supercontinent, gondwana, which, collided, with, north, america, europe, laurussia, along, the, present, line, of, eastern, north, america, this, continental, collision, resulted, in, the, hercynian, orogeny, in, europe, and, the, alleghenian, orogeny, in, north, america, it, also, extended, the, newly, uplifted, appalachians, southwestward, as, the, ouachita, mountains, in, the, same, time, frame, much, of, present, eastern, eurasian, plate, welded, itself, to, europe, along, the, line, of, the, ural, mountains, there, were, two, major, oceans, in, the, carboniferous, the, panthalassa, and, paleo, tethys, other, minor, oceans, were, shrinking, and, eventually, closed, the, rheic, ocean, closed, by, the, assembly, of, south, and, north, america, the, small, shallow, ural, ocean, which, was, closed, by, the, collision, of, baltica, and, siberia, continents, creating, the, ural, mountains, and, proto, tethys, ocean, the, permian, extends, from, about, 298, 9, 0, 15, to, 252, 17, 0, 06, ma, during, the, permian, all, the, earth, s, major, land, masses, except, portions, of, east, asia, were, collected, into, a, single, supercontinent, known, as, pangaea, pangaea, straddled, the, equator, and, extended, toward, the, poles, with, a, corresponding, effect, on, ocean, currents, in, the, single, great, ocean, panthalassa, the, universal, sea, and, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, a, large, ocean, that, was, between, asia, and, gondwana, the, cimmeria, continent, rifted, away, from, gondwana, and, drifted, north, to, laurasia, causing, the, paleo, tethys, to, shrink, a, new, ocean, was, growing, on, its, southern, end, the, tethys, ocean, an, ocean, that, would, dominate, much, of, the, mesozoic, era, large, continental, landmasses, create, climates, with, extreme, variations, of, heat, and, cold, continental, climate, and, monsoon, conditions, with, highly, seasonal, rainfall, patterns, deserts, seem, to, have, been, widespread, on, pangaea, the, mesozoic, extended, roughly, from, 252, to, 66, million, years, ago, after, the, vigorous, convergent, plate, mountain, building, of, the, late, paleozoic, mesozoic, tectonic, deformation, was, comparatively, mild, nevertheless, the, era, featured, the, dramatic, rifting, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, pangaea, gradually, split, into, a, northern, continent, laurasia, and, a, southern, continent, gondwana, this, created, the, passive, continental, margin, that, characterizes, most, of, the, atlantic, coastline, such, as, along, the, u, s, east, coast, today, the, triassic, period, extends, from, about, 252, 17, 0, 06, to, 201, 3, 0, 2, ma, during, the, triassic, almost, all, the, earth, s, land, mass, was, concentrated, into, a, single, supercontinent, centered, more, or, less, on, the, equator, called, pangaea, all, the, land, this, took, the, form, of, a, giant, pac, man, with, an, east, facing, mouth, constituting, the, tethys, sea, a, vast, gulf, that, opened, farther, westward, in, the, mid, triassic, at, the, expense, of, the, shrinking, paleo, tethys, ocean, an, ocean, that, existed, during, the, paleozoic, the, remainder, was, the, world, ocean, known, as, panthalassa, all, the, sea, all, the, deep, ocean, sediments, laid, down, during, the, triassic, have, disappeared, through, subduction, of, oceanic, plates, thus, very, little, is, known, of, the, triassic, open, ocean, the, supercontinent, pangaea, was, rifting, during, the, triassic, especially, late, in, the, period, but, had, not, yet, separated, the, first, nonmarine, sediments, in, the, rift, that, marks, the, initial, break, up, of, pangea, which, separated, new, jersey, from, morocco, are, of, late, triassic, age, in, the, u, s, these, thick, sediments, comprise, the, newark, supergroup, because, of, the, limited, shoreline, of, one, super, continental, mass, triassic, marine, deposits, are, globally, relatively, rare, despite, their, prominence, in, western, europe, where, the, triassic, was, first, studied, in, north, america, for, example, marine, deposits, are, limited, to, a, few, exposures, in, the, west, thus, triassic, stratigraphy, is, mostly, based, on, organisms, living, in, lagoons, and, hypersaline, environments, such, as, estheria, crustaceans, and, terrestrial, vertebrates, the, jurassic, period, extends, from, about, 201, 3, 0, 2, to, 145, 0, ma, during, the, early, jurassic, the, supercontinent, pangaea, broke, up, into, the, northern, supercontinent, laurasia, and, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, the, gulf, of, mexico, opened, in, the, new, rift, between, north, america, and, what, is, now, mexico, s, yucatan, peninsula, the, jurassic, north, atlantic, ocean, was, relatively, narrow, while, the, south, atlantic, did, not, open, until, the, following, cretaceous, period, when, gondwana, itself, rifted, apart, the, tethys, sea, closed, and, the, neotethys, basin, appeared, climates, were, warm, with, no, evidence, of, glaciation, as, in, the, triassic, there, was, apparently, no, land, near, either, pole, and, no, extensive, ice, caps, existed, the, jurassic, geological, record, is, good, in, western, europe, where, extensive, marine, sequences, indicate, a, time, when, much, of, the, continent, was, submerged, under, shallow, tropical, seas, famous, locales, include, the, jurassic, coast, world, heritage, site, and, the, renowned, late, jurassic, lagerst, tten, of, holzmaden, and, solnhofen, in, contrast, the, north, american, jurassic, record, is, the, poorest, of, the, mesozoic, with, few, outcrops, at, the, surface, though, the, epicontinental, sundance, sea, left, marine, deposits, in, parts, of, the, northern, plains, of, the, united, states, and, canada, during, the, late, jurassic, most, exposed, sediments, from, this, period, are, continental, such, as, the, alluvial, deposits, of, the, morrison, formation, the, first, of, several, massive, batholiths, were, emplaced, in, the, northern, cordillera, beginning, in, the, mid, jurassic, marking, the, nevadan, orogeny, important, jurassic, exposures, are, also, found, in, russia, india, south, america, japan, australasia, and, the, united, kingdom, the, cretaceous, period, extends, from, circa, 145, million, years, ago, to, 66, million, years, ago, during, the, cretaceous, the, late, paleozoic, early, mesozoic, supercontinent, of, pangaea, completed, its, breakup, into, present, day, continents, although, their, positions, were, substantially, different, at, the, time, as, the, atlantic, ocean, widened, the, convergent, margin, orogenies, that, had, begun, during, the, jurassic, continued, in, the, north, american, cordillera, as, the, nevadan, orogeny, was, followed, by, the, sevier, and, laramide, orogenies, though, gondwana, was, still, intact, in, the, beginning, of, the, cretaceous, gondwana, itself, broke, up, as, south, america, antarctica, and, australia, rifted, away, from, africa, though, india, and, madagascar, remained, attached, to, each, other, thus, the, south, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, were, newly, formed, such, active,
