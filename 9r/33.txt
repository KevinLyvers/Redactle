a, nautical, mile, is, a, unit, of, length, used, in, air, marine, and, space, navigation, and, for, the, definition, of, territorial, waters, historically, it, was, defined, as, the, meridian, arc, length, corresponding, to, one, minute, 1, 60, of, a, degree, of, latitude, at, the, equator, so, that, earth, s, polar, circumference, is, very, near, to, 21, 600, nautical, miles, that, is, 60, minutes, 360, degrees, today, the, international, nautical, mile, is, defined, as, 1, 852, metres, about, 6, 076, ft, 1, 151, mi, the, derived, unit, of, speed, is, the, knot, one, nautical, mile, per, hour, there, is, no, single, internationally, agreed, symbol, with, several, symbols, in, use, the, word, mile, is, from, the, latin, phrase, for, a, thousand, paces, mille, passus, navigation, at, sea, was, done, by, eye, until, around, 1500, when, navigational, instruments, were, developed, and, cartographers, began, using, a, coordinate, system, with, parallels, of, latitude, and, meridians, of, longitude, the, earliest, reference, of, 60, miles, to, a, degree, is, a, map, by, nicolaus, germanus, in, a, 1482, edition, of, ptolemy, s, geography, indicating, one, degree, of, longitude, at, the, equator, contains, milaria, 60, an, earlier, manuscript, map, by, nicolaus, germanus, in, a, previous, edition, of, geography, states, unul, gradul, log, et, latitud, sub, equinortiali, formet, stadia, 500, que, fanut, miliaria, 62, 1, 2, one, degree, longitude, and, latitude, under, the, equator, forms, 500, stadia, which, make, 62, 1, 2, miles, whether, a, correction, or, convenience, the, reason, for, the, change, from, 62, 1, 2, to, 60, miles, to, a, degree, is, not, explained, eventually, the, ratio, of, 60, miles, to, a, degree, appeared, in, english, in, a, 1555, translation, of, pietro, martire, d, anghiera, s, decades, assigned, likewise, to, every, degree, three, score, miles, by, the, late, 16th, century, english, geographers, and, navigators, knew, that, the, ratio, of, distances, at, sea, to, degrees, was, constant, along, any, great, circle, such, as, the, equator, or, any, meridian, assuming, that, earth, was, a, sphere, in, 1574, william, bourne, stated, in, a, regiment, for, the, sea, the, rule, to, raise, a, degree, practised, by, navigators, but, as, i, take, it, we, in, england, should, allowe, 60, myles, to, one, degr, e, that, is, after, 3, miles, to, one, of, our, englishe, leagues, wherefore, 20, of, oure, english, leagues, shoulde, answere, to, one, degr, e, likewise, robert, hues, wrote, in, 1594, that, the, distance, along, a, great, circle, was, 60, miles, per, degree, however, these, referred, to, the, old, english, mile, of, 5000, feet, and, league, of, 15, 000, feet, relying, upon, ptolemy, s, underestimate, of, the, earth, s, circumference, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, english, geographers, started, to, acknowledge, the, discrepancy, between, the, angular, measurement, of, a, degree, of, latitude, and, the, linear, measurement, of, miles, in, 1624, edmund, gunter, suggested, 352, 000, feet, to, a, degree, 5866, 2, 3, feet, per, arcminute, in, 1633, william, oughtred, suggested, 349, 800, feet, to, a, degree, 5830, feet, per, arcminute, both, gunter, and, oughtred, put, forward, the, notion, of, dividing, a, degree, into, 100, parts, but, their, proposal, was, generally, ignored, by, navigators, the, ratio, of, 60, miles, or, 20, leagues, to, a, degree, of, latitude, remained, fixed, while, the, length, of, the, mile, was, revised, with, better, estimates, of, the, earth, s, circumference, in, 1637, robert, norwood, proposed, a, new, measurement, of, 6120, feet, for, an, arcminute, of, latitude, which, was, within, 44, feet, of, the, currently, accepted, value, for, a, nautical, mile, since, the, earth, is, not, a, perfect, sphere, but, is, an, oblate, spheroid, with, slightly, flattened, poles, a, minute, of, latitude, is, not, constant, but, about, 1, 861, metres, at, the, poles, and, 1, 843, metres, at, the, equator, france, and, other, metric, countries, state, that, in, principle, a, nautical, mile, is, an, arcminute, of, a, meridian, at, a, latitude, of, 45, but, that, is, a, modern, justification, for, a, more, mundane, calculation, that, was, developed, a, century, earlier, by, the, mid, 19th, century, france, had, defined, a, nautical, mile, via, the, original, 1791, definition, of, the, metre, one, ten, millionth, of, a, quarter, meridian, so, 10, 000, 000, m, 90, 60, 1, 851, 85, m, 1, 852, m, became, the, metric, length, for, a, nautical, mile, france, made, it, legal, for, the, french, navy, in, 1906, and, many, metric, countries, voted, to, sanction, it, for, international, use, at, the, 1929, international, hydrographic, conference, both, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, used, an, average, arcminute, specifically, a, minute, of, arc, of, a, great, circle, of, a, sphere, having, the, same, surface, area, as, the, clarke, 1866, ellipsoid, the, authalic, equal, area, radius, of, the, clarke, 1866, ellipsoid, is, 6, 370, 997, 2, metres, 20, 902, 222, ft, the, resulting, arcminute, is, 1, 853, 2480, metres, 6, 080, 210, ft, the, united, states, chose, five, significant, digits, for, its, nautical, mile, 6, 080, 2, feet, whereas, the, united, kingdom, chose, four, significant, digits, for, its, admiralty, mile, 6, 080, feet, in, 1929, the, international, nautical, mile, was, defined, by, the, first, international, extraordinary, hydrographic, conference, in, monaco, as, exactly, 1, 852, metres, which, is, 6, 076, 12, ft, the, united, states, did, not, adopt, the, international, nautical, mile, until, 1954, britain, adopted, it, in, 1970, but, legal, references, to, the, obsolete, unit, are, now, converted, to, 1, 853, metres, which, is, 6, 079, 40, ft, the, metre, was, originally, defined, as, 1, 10, 000, 000, of, the, length, of, the, meridian, arc, from, the, north, pole, to, the, equator, 1, of, a, centesimal, degree, of, latitude, thus, one, kilometre, of, distance, corresponds, to, one, centigrad, also, known, as, centesimal, arc, minute, of, latitude, the, earth, s, circumference, is, therefore, approximately, 40, 000, km, the, equatorial, circumference, is, slightly, longer, than, the, polar, circumference, the, measurement, based, on, this, 40, 075, 017, km, 360, 60, 1, 855, 3, metres, is, known, as, the, geographical, mile, using, the, definition, 1, 60, of, a, degree, of, latitude, on, mars, a, martian, nautical, mile, equals, to, 983, m, 1, 075, yd, this, is, potentially, useful, for, celestial, navigation, on, a, human, mission, to, the, planet, both, as, a, shorthand, and, a, quick, way, to, roughly, determine, the, location
