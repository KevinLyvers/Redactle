brass, is, an, alloy, of, copper, and, zinc, in, proportions, which, can, be, varied, to, achieve, different, colours, and, mechanical, electrical, acoustic, and, chemical, properties, but, copper, typically, has, the, larger, proportion, generally, 66, copper, and, 34, zinc, in, use, since, prehistoric, times, it, is, a, substitutional, alloy, atoms, of, the, two, constituents, may, replace, each, other, within, the, same, crystal, structure, brass, is, similar, to, bronze, a, copper, alloy, that, contains, tin, instead, of, zinc, both, bronze, and, brass, may, include, small, proportions, of, a, range, of, other, elements, including, arsenic, lead, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and, silicon, historically, the, distinction, between, the, two, alloys, has, been, less, consistent, and, clear, and, increasingly, museums, use, the, more, general, term, copper, alloy, brass, has, long, been, a, popular, material, for, its, bright, gold, like, appearance, and, is, still, used, for, drawer, pulls, and, doorknobs, it, has, also, been, widely, used, to, make, sculpture, and, utensils, because, of, its, low, melting, point, high, workability, both, with, hand, tools, and, with, modern, turning, and, milling, machines, durability, and, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, brasses, with, higher, copper, content, are, softer, and, more, golden, in, colour, conversely, those, with, less, copper, and, thus, more, zinc, are, harder, and, more, silvery, in, colour, brass, is, still, commonly, used, in, applications, where, corrosion, resistance, and, low, friction, are, required, such, as, locks, hinges, gears, bearings, ammunition, casings, zippers, plumbing, hose, couplings, valves, and, electrical, plugs, and, sockets, it, is, used, extensively, for, musical, instruments, such, as, horns, and, bells, the, composition, of, brass, makes, it, a, favorable, substitute, for, copper, in, costume, jewelry, and, fashion, jewelry, as, it, exhibits, greater, resistance, to, corrosion, brass, is, not, as, hard, as, bronze, and, so, is, not, suitable, for, most, weapons, and, tools, nor, is, it, suitable, for, marine, uses, because, the, zinc, reacts, with, minerals, in, salt, water, leaving, porous, copper, behind, marine, brass, with, added, tin, avoids, this, as, does, bronze, brass, is, often, used, in, situations, in, which, it, is, important, that, sparks, not, be, struck, such, as, in, fittings, and, tools, used, near, flammable, or, explosive, materials, brass, is, more, malleable, than, bronze, or, zinc, the, relatively, low, melting, point, of, brass, 900, to, 940, c, 1, 650, to, 1, 720, f, depending, on, composition, and, its, flow, characteristics, make, it, a, relatively, easy, material, to, cast, by, varying, the, proportions, of, copper, and, zinc, the, properties, of, the, brass, can, be, changed, allowing, hard, and, soft, brasses, the, density, of, brass, is, 8, 4, to, 8, 73, g, cm, 3, 0, 303, to, 0, 315, lb, cu, in, today, almost, 90, of, all, brass, alloys, are, recycled, because, brass, is, not, ferromagnetic, ferrous, scrap, can, be, separated, from, it, by, passing, the, scrap, near, a, powerful, magnet, brass, scrap, is, melted, and, recast, into, billets, that, are, extruded, into, the, desired, form, and, size, the, general, softness, of, brass, means, that, it, can, often, be, machined, without, the, use, of, cutting, fluid, though, there, are, exceptions, to, this, aluminium, makes, brass, stronger, and, more, corrosion, resistant, aluminium, also, causes, a, highly, beneficial, hard, layer, of, aluminium, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, to, be, formed, on, the, surface, that, is, thin, transparent, and, self, healing, tin, has, a, similar, effect, and, finds, its, use, especially, in, seawater, applications, naval, brasses, combinations, of, iron, aluminium, silicon, and, manganese, make, brass, wear, and, tear, resistant, the, addition, of, as, little, as, 1, iron, to, a, brass, alloy, will, result, in, an, alloy, with, a, noticeable, magnetic, attraction, brass, will, corrode, in, the, presence, of, moisture, chlorides, acetates, ammonia, and, certain, acids, this, often, happens, when, the, copper, reacts, with, sulfur, to, form, a, brown, and, eventually, black, surface, layer, of, copper, sulfide, which, if, regularly, exposed, to, slightly, acidic, water, such, as, urban, rainwater, can, then, oxidize, in, air, to, form, a, patina, of, green, blue, copper, carbonate, depending, on, how, the, patina, layer, was, formed, it, may, protect, the, underlying, brass, from, further, damage, although, copper, and, zinc, have, a, large, difference, in, electrical, potential, the, resulting, brass, alloy, does, not, experience, internalized, galvanic, corrosion, because, of, the, absence, of, a, corrosive, environment, within, the, mixture, however, if, brass, is, placed, in, contact, with, a, more, noble, metal, such, as, silver, or, gold, in, such, an, environment, the, brass, will, corrode, galvanically, conversely, if, brass, is, in, contact, with, a, less, noble, metal, such, as, zinc, or, iron, the, less, noble, metal, will, corrode, and, the, brass, will, be, protected, to, enhance, the, machinability, of, brass, lead, is, often, added, in, concentrations, of, about, 2, since, lead, has, a, lower, melting, point, than, the, other, constituents, of, the, brass, it, tends, to, migrate, towards, the, grain, boundaries, in, the, form, of, globules, as, it, cools, from, casting, the, pattern, the, globules, form, on, the, surface, of, the, brass, increases, the, available, lead, surface, area, which, in, turn, affects, the, degree, of, leaching, in, addition, cutting, operations, can, smear, the, lead, globules, over, the, surface, these, effects, can, lead, to, significant, lead, leaching, from, brasses, of, comparatively, low, lead, content, in, october, 1999, the, california, state, attorney, general, sued, 13, key, manufacturers, and, distributors, over, lead, content, in, laboratory, tests, state, researchers, found, the, average, brass, key, new, or, old, exceeded, the, california, proposition, 65, limits, by, an, average, factor, of, 19, assuming, handling, twice, a, day, in, april, 2001, manufacturers, agreed, to, reduce, lead, content, to, 1, 5, or, face, a, requirement, to, warn, consumers, about, lead, content, keys, plated, with, other, metals, are, not, affected, by, the, settlement, and, may, continue, to, use, brass, alloys, with, a, higher, percentage, of, lead, content, also, in, california, lead, free, materials, must, be, used, for, each, component, that, comes, into, contact, with, the, wetted, surface, of, pipes, and, pipe, fittings, plumbing, fittings, and, fixtures, on, 1, january, 2010, the, maximum, amount, of, lead, in, lead, free, brass, in, california, was, reduced, from, 4, to, 0, 25, lead, dezincification, resistant, dzr, or, dr, brasses, sometimes, referred, to, as, cr, corrosion, resistant, brasses, are, used, where, there, is, a, large, corrosion, risk, and, where, normal, brasses, do, not, meet, the, requirements, applications, with, high, water, temperatures, chlorides, present, or, deviating, water, qualities, soft, water, play, a, role, dzr, brass, is, used, in, water, boiler, systems, this, brass, alloy, must, be, produced, with, great, care, with, special, attention, placed, on, a, balanced, composition, and, proper, production, temperatures, and, parameters, to, avoid, long, term, failures, an, example, of, dzr, brass, is, the, c352, brass, with, about, 30, zinc, 61, 63, copper, 1, 7, 2, 8, lead, and, 0, 02, 0, 15, arsenic, the, lead, and, arsenic, significantly, suppress, the, zinc, loss, red, brasses, a, family, of, alloys, with, high, copper, proportion, and, generally, less, than, 15, zinc, are, more, resistant, to, zinc, loss, one, of, the, metals, called, red, brass, is, 85, copper, 5, tin, 5, lead, and, 5, zinc, copper, alloy, c23000, which, is, also, known, as, red, brass, contains, 84, 86, copper, 0, 05, each, iron, and, lead, with, the, balance, being, zinc, another, such, material, is, gunmetal, from, the, family, of, red, brasses, gunmetal, alloys, contain, roughly, 88, copper, 8, 10, tin, and, 2, 4, zinc, lead, can, be, added, for, ease, of, machining, or, for, bearing, alloys, naval, brass, for, use, in, seawater, contains, 40, zinc, but, also, 1, tin, the, tin, addition, suppresses, zinc, leaching, the, nsf, international, requires, brasses, with, more, than, 15, zinc, used, in, piping, and, plumbing, fittings, to, be, dezincification, resistant, the, high, malleability, and, workability, relatively, good, resistance, to, corrosion, and, traditionally, attributed, acoustic, properties, of, brass, have, made, it, the, usual, metal, of, choice, for, construction, of, musical, instruments, whose, acoustic, resonators, consist, of, long, relatively, narrow, tubing, often, folded, or, coiled, for, compactness, silver, and, its, alloys, and, even, gold, have, been, used, for, the, same, reasons, but, brass, is, the, most, economical, choice, collectively, known, as, brass, instruments, or, simply, the, brass, these, include, the, trombone, tuba, trumpet, cornet, flugelhorn, baritone, horn, euphonium, tenor, horn, and, french, horn, and, many, other, horns, many, in, variously, sized, families, such, as, the, saxhorns, other, wind, instruments, may, be, constructed, of, brass, or, other, metals, and, indeed, most, modern, student, model, flutes, and, piccolos, are, made, of, some, variety, of, brass, usually, a, cupronickel, alloy, similar, to, nickel, silver, also, known, as, german, silver, clarinets, especially, low, clarinets, such, as, the, contrabass, and, subcontrabass, are, sometimes, made, of, metal, because, of, limited, supplies, of, the, dense, fine, grained, tropical, hardwoods, traditionally, preferred, for, smaller, woodwinds, for, the, same, reason, some, low, clarinets, bassoons, and, contrabassoons, feature, a, hybrid, construction, with, long, straight, sections, of, wood, and, curved, joints, neck, and, or, bell, of, metal, the, use, of, metal, also, avoids, the, risks, of, exposing, wooden, instruments, to, changes, in, temperature, or, humidity, which, can, cause, sudden, cracking, even, though, the, saxophones, and, sarrusophones, are, classified, as, woodwind, instruments, they, are, normally, made, of, brass, for, similar, reasons, and, because, their, wide, conical, bores, and, thin, walled, bodies, are, more, easily, and, efficiently, made, by, forming, sheet, metal, than, by, machining, wood, the, keywork, of, most, modern, woodwinds, including, wooden, bodied, instruments, is, also, usually, made, of, an, alloy, such, as, nickel, silver, such, alloys, are, stiffer, and, more, durable, than, the, brass, used, to, construct, the, instrument, bodies, but, still, workable, with, simple, hand, tools, a, boon, to, quick, repairs, the, mouthpieces, of, both, brass, instruments, and, less, commonly, woodwind, instruments, are, often, made, of, brass, among, other, metals, as, well, next, to, the, brass, instruments, the, most, notable, use, of, brass, in, music, is, in, various, percussion, instruments, most, notably, cymbals, gongs, and, orchestral, tubular, bells, large, church, bells, are, normally, made, of, bronze, small, handbells, and, jingle, bells, are, also, commonly, made, of, brass, the, harmonica, is, a, free, reed, aerophone, also, often, made, from, brass, in, organ, pipes, of, the, reed, family, brass, strips, called, tongues, are, used, as, the, reeds, which, beat, against, the, shallot, or, beat, through, the, shallot, in, the, case, of, a, free, reed, although, not, part, of, the, brass, section, snare, drums, are, also, sometimes, made, of, brass, some, parts, on, electric, guitars, are, also, made, from, brass, especially, inertia, blocks, on, tremolo, systems, for, its, tonal, properties, and, for, string, nuts, and, saddles, for, both, tonal, properties, and, its, low, friction, the, bactericidal, properties, of, brass, have, been, observed, for, centuries, particularly, in, marine, environments, where, it, prevents, biofouling, depending, upon, the, type, and, concentration, of, pathogens, and, the, medium, they, are, in, brass, kills, these, microorganisms, within, a, few, minutes, to, hours, of, contact, a, large, number, of, independent, studies, confirm, this, antimicrobial, effect, even, against, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, such, as, mrsa, and, vrsa, the, mechanisms, of, antimicrobial, action, by, copper, and, its, alloys, including, brass, are, a, subject, of, intense, and, ongoing, investigation, brass, is, susceptible, to, stress, corrosion, cracking, especially, from, ammonia, or, substances, containing, or, releasing, ammonia, the, problem, is, sometimes, known, as, season, cracking, after, it, was, first, discovered, in, brass, cartridges, used, for, rifle, ammunition, during, the, 1920s, in, the, british, indian, army, the, problem, was, caused, by, high, residual, stresses, from, cold, forming, of, the, cases, during, manufacture, together, with, chemical, attack, from, traces, of, ammonia, in, the, atmosphere, the, cartridges, were, stored, in, stables, and, the, ammonia, concentration, rose, during, the, hot, summer, months, thus, initiating, brittle, cracks, the, problem, was, resolved, by, annealing, the, cases, and, storing, the, cartridges, elsewhere, other, phases, than, and, are, a, hexagonal, intermetallic, cuzn, 3, and, a, solid, solution, of, copper, in, zinc, although, forms, of, brass, have, been, in, use, since, prehistory, its, true, nature, as, a, copper, zinc, alloy, was, not, understood, until, the, post, medieval, period, because, the, zinc, vapor, which, reacted, with, copper, to, make, brass, was, not, recognized, as, a, metal, the, king, james, bible, makes, many, references, to, brass, to, translate, nechosheth, bronze, or, copper, from, hebrew, to, english, the, earliest, brasses, may, have, been, natural, alloys, made, by, smelting, zinc, rich, copper, ores, by, the, roman, period, brass, was, being, deliberately, produced, from, metallic, copper, and, zinc, minerals, using, the, cementation, process, the, product, of, which, was, calamine, brass, and, variations, on, this, method, continued, until, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, eventually, replaced, by, speltering, the, direct, alloying, of, copper, and, zinc, metal, which, was, introduced, to, europe, in, the, 16th, century, brass, has, sometimes, historically, been, referred, to, as, yellow, copper, in, west, asia, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, early, copper, zinc, alloys, are, now, known, in, small, numbers, from, a, number, of, 3rd, millennium, bc, sites, in, the, aegean, iraq, the, united, arab, emirates, kalmykia, turkmenistan, and, georgia, and, from, 2nd, millennium, bc, sites, in, western, india, uzbekistan, iran, syria, iraq, and, canaan, isolated, examples, of, copper, zinc, alloys, are, known, in, china, from, the, 1st, century, ad, long, after, bronze, was, widely, used, the, compositions, of, these, early, brass, objects, are, highly, variable, and, most, have, zinc, contents, of, between, 5, and, 15, wt, which, is, lower, than, in, brass, produced, by, cementation, these, may, be, natural, alloys, manufactured, by, smelting, zinc, rich, copper, ores, in, redox, conditions, many, have, similar, tin, contents, to, contemporary, bronze, artefacts, and, it, is, possible, that, some, copper, zinc, alloys, were, accidental, and, perhaps, not, even, distinguished, from, copper, however, the, large, number, of, copper, zinc, alloys, now, known, suggests, that, at, least, some, were, deliberately, manufactured, and, many, have, zinc, contents, of, more, than, 12, wt, which, would, have, resulted, in, a, distinctive, golden, colour, by, the, 8th, 7th, century, bc, assyrian, cuneiform, tablets, mention, the, exploitation, of, the, copper, of, the, mountains, and, this, may, refer, to, natural, brass, oreikhalkon, mountain, copper, the, ancient, greek, translation, of, this, term, was, later, adapted, to, the, latin, aurichalcum, meaning, golden, copper, which, became, the, standard, term, for, brass, in, the, 4th, century, bc, plato, knew, orichalkos, as, rare, and, nearly, as, valuable, as, gold, and, pliny, describes, how, aurichalcum, had, come, from, cypriot, ore, deposits, which, had, been, exhausted, by, the, 1st, century, ad, x, ray, fluorescence, analysis, of, 39, orichalcum, ingots, recovered, from, a, 2, 600, year, old, shipwreck, off, sicily, found, them, to, be, an, alloy, made, with, 75, 80, copper, 15, 20, zinc, and, small, percentages, of, nickel, lead, and, iron, during, the, later, part, of, first, millennium, bc, the, use, of, brass, spread, across, a, wide, geographical, area, from, britain, and, spain, in, the, west, to, iran, and, india, in, the, east, this, seems, to, have, been, encouraged, by, exports, and, influence, from, the, middle, east, and, eastern, mediterranean, where, deliberate, production, of, brass, from, metallic, copper, and, zinc, ores, had, been, introduced, the, 4th, century, bc, writer, theopompus, quoted, by, strabo, describes, how, heating, earth, from, andeira, in, turkey, produced, droplets, of, false, silver, probably, metallic, zinc, which, could, be, used, to, turn, copper, into, oreichalkos, in, the, 1st, century, bc, the, greek, dioscorides, seems, to, have, recognized, a, link, between, zinc, minerals, and, brass, describing, how, cadmia, zinc, oxide, was, found, on, the, walls, of, furnaces, used, to, heat, either, zinc, ore, or, copper, and, explaining, that, it, can, then, be, used, to, make, brass, by, the, first, century, bc, brass, was, available, in, sufficient, supply, to, use, as, coinage, in, phrygia, and, bithynia, and, after, the, augustan, currency, reform, of, 23, bc, it, was, also, used, to, make, roman, dupondii, and, sestertii, the, uniform, use, of, brass, for, coinage, and, military, equipment, across, the, roman, world, may, indicate, a, degree, of, state, involvement, in, the, industry, and, brass, even, seems, to, have, been, deliberately, boycotted, by, jewish, communities, in, palestine, because, of, its, association, with, roman, authority, brass, was, produced, by, the, cementation, process, where, copper, and, zinc, ore, are, heated, together, until, zinc, vapor, is, produced, which, reacts, with, the, copper, there, is, good, archaeological, evidence, for, this, process, and, crucibles, used, to, produce, brass, by, cementation, have, been, found, on, roman, period, sites, including, xanten, and, nidda, in, germany, lyon, in, france, and, at, a, number, of, sites, in, britain, they, vary, in, size, from, tiny, acorn, sized, to, large, amphorae, like, vessels, but, all, have, elevated, levels, of, zinc, on, the, interior, and, are, lidded, they, show, no, signs, of, slag, or, metal, prills, suggesting, that, zinc, minerals, were, heated, to, produce, zinc, vapor, which, reacted, with, metallic, copper, in, a, solid, state, reaction, the, fabric, of, these, crucibles, is, porous, probably, designed, to, prevent, a, buildup, of, pressure, and, many, have, small, holes, in, the, lids, which, may, be, designed, to, release, pressure, or, to, add, additional, zinc, minerals, near, the, end, of, the, process, dioscorides, mentioned, that, zinc, minerals, were, used, for, both, the, working, and, finishing, of, brass, perhaps, suggesting, secondary, additions, brass, made, during, the, early, roman, period, seems, to, have, varied, between, 20, and, 28, wt, zinc, the, high, content, of, zinc, in, coinage, and, brass, objects, declined, after, the, first, century, ad, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, reflects, zinc, loss, during, recycling, and, thus, an, interruption, in, the, production, of, new, brass, however, it, is, now, thought, this, was, probably, a, deliberate, change, in, composition, and, overall, the, use, of, brass, increases, over, this, period, making, up, around, 40, of, all, copper, alloys, used, in, the, roman, world, by, the, 4th, century, ad, little, is, known, about, the, production, of, brass, during, the, centuries, immediately, after, the, collapse, of, the, roman, empire, disruption, in, the, trade, of, tin, for, bronze, from, western, europe, may, have, contributed, to, the, increasing, popularity, of, brass, in, the, east, and, by, the, 6th, 7th, centuries, ad, over, 90, of, copper, alloy, artefacts, from, egypt, were, made, of, brass, however, other, alloys, such, as, low, tin, bronze, were, also, used, and, they, vary, depending, on, local, cultural, attitudes, the, purpose, of, the, metal, and, access, to, zinc, especially, between, the, islamic, and, byzantine, world, conversely, the, use, of, true, brass, seems, to, have, declined, in, western, europe, during, this, period, in, favor, of, gunmetals, and, other, mixed, alloys, but, by, about, 1000, brass, artefacts, are, found, in, scandinavian, graves, in, scotland, brass, was, being, used, in, the, manufacture, of, coins, in, northumbria, and, there, is, archaeological, and, historical, evidence, for, the, production, of, calamine, brass, in, germany, and, the, low, countries, areas, rich, in, calamine, ore, these, places, would, remain, important, centres, of, brass, making, throughout, the, middle, ages, period, especially, dinant, brass, objects, are, still, collectively, known, as, dinanderie, in, french, the, baptismal, font, at, st, bartholomew, s, church, li, ge, in, modern, belgium, before, 1117, is, an, outstanding, masterpiece, of, romanesque, brass, casting, though, also, often, described, as, bronze, the, metal, of, the, early, 12th, century, gloucester, candlestick, is, unusual, even, by, medieval, standards, in, being, a, mixture, of, copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, and, arsenic, with, an, unusually, large, amount, of, silver, ranging, from, 22, 5, in, the, base, to, 5, 76, in, the, pan, below, the, candle, the, proportions, of, this, mixture, may, suggest, that, the, candlestick, was, made, from, a, hoard, of, old, coins, probably, late, roman, latten, is, a, term, for, medieval, alloys, of, uncertain, and, often, variable, composition, often, covering, decorative, borders, and, similar, objects, cut, from, sheet, metal, whether, of, brass, or, bronze, especially, in, tibetan, art, analysis, of, some, objects, shows, very, different, compositions, from, different, ends, of, a, large, piece, aquamaniles, were, typically, made, in, brass, in, both, the, european, and, islamic, worlds, the, cementation, process, continued, to, be, used, but, literary, sources, from, both, europe, and, the, islamic, world, seem, to, describe, variants, of, a, higher, temperature, liquid, process, which, took, place, in, open, topped, crucibles, islamic, cementation, seems, to, have, used, zinc, oxide, known, as, tutiya, or, tutty, rather, than, zinc, ores, for, brass, making, resulting, in, a, metal, with, lower, iron, impurities, a, number, of, islamic, writers, and, the, 13th, century, italian, marco, polo, describe, how, this, was, obtained, by, sublimation, from, zinc, ores, and, condensed, onto, clay, or, iron, bars, archaeological, examples, of, which, have, been, identified, at, kush, in, iran, it, could, then, be, used, for, brass, making, or, medicinal, purposes, in, 10th, century, yemen, al, hamdani, described, how, spreading, al, iglimiya, probably, zinc, oxide, onto, the, surface, of, molten, copper, produced, tutiya, vapor, which, then, reacted, with, the, metal, the, 13th, century, iranian, writer, al, kashani, describes, a, more, complex, process, whereby, tutiya, was, mixed, with, raisins, and, gently, roasted, before, being, added, to, the, surface, of, the, molten, metal, a, temporary, lid, was, added, at, this, point, presumably, to, minimize, the, escape, of, zinc, vapor, in, europe, a, similar, liquid, process, in, open, topped, crucibles, took, place, which, was, probably, less, efficient, than, the, roman, process, and, the, use, of, the, term, tutty, by, albertus, magnus, in, the, 13th, century, suggests, influence, from, islamic, technology, the, 12th, century, german, monk, theophilus, described, how, preheated, crucibles, were, one, sixth, filled, with, powdered, calamine, and, charcoal, then, topped, up, with, copper, and, charcoal, before, being, melted, stirred, then, filled, again, the, final, product, was, cast, then, again, melted, with, calamine, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, second, melting, may, have, taken, place, at, a, lower, temperature, to, allow, more, zinc, to, be, absorbed, albertus, magnus, noted, that, the, power, of, both, calamine, and, tutty, could, evaporate, and, described, how, the, addition, of, powdered, glass, could, create, a, film, to, bind, it, to, the, metal, german, brass, making, crucibles, are, known, from, dortmund, dating, to, the, 10th, century, ad, and, from, soest, and, schwerte, in, westphalia, dating, to, around, the, 13th, century, confirm, theophilus, account, as, they, are, open, topped, although, ceramic, discs, from, soest, may, have, served, as, loose, lids, which, may, have, been, used, to, reduce, zinc, evaporation, and, have, slag, on, the, interior, resulting, from, a, liquid, process, some, of, the, most, famous, objects, in, african, art, are, the, lost, wax, castings, of, west, africa, mostly, from, what, is, now, nigeria, produced, first, by, the, kingdom, of, ife, and, then, the, benin, empire, though, normally, described, as, bronzes, the, benin, bronzes, now, mostly, in, the, british, museum, and, other, western, collections, and, the, large, portrait, heads, such, as, the, bronze, head, from, ife, of, heavily, leaded, zinc, brass, and, the, bronze, head, of, queen, idia, both, also, british, museum, are, better, described, as, brass, though, of, variable, compositions, work, in, brass, or, bronze, continued, to, be, important, in, benin, art, and, other, west, african, traditions, such, as, akan, goldweights, where, the, metal, was, regarded, as, a, more, valuable, material, than, in, europe, the, renaissance, saw, important, changes, to, both, the, theory, and, practice, of, brassmaking, in, europe, by, the, 15th, century, there, is, evidence, for, the, renewed, use, of, lidded, cementation, crucibles, at, zwickau, in, germany, these, large, crucibles, were, capable, of, producing, c, 20, kg, of, brass, there, are, traces, of, slag, and, pieces, of, metal, on, the, interior, their, irregular, composition, suggests, that, this, was, a, lower, temperature, not, entirely, liquid, process, the, crucible, lids, had, small, holes, which, were, blocked, with, clay, plugs, near, the, end, of, the, process, presumably, to, maximize, zinc, absorption, in, the, final, stages, triangular, crucibles, were, then, used, to, melt, the, brass, for, casting, 16th, century, technical, writers, such, as, biringuccio, ercker, and, agricola, described, a, variety, of, cementation, brass, making, techniques, and, came, closer, to, understanding, the, true, nature, of, the, process, noting, that, copper, became, heavier, as, it, changed, to, brass, and, that, it, became, more, golden, as, additional, calamine, was, added, zinc, metal, was, also, becoming, more, commonplace, by, 1513, metallic, zinc, ingots, from, india, and, china, were, arriving, in, london, and, pellets, of, zinc, condensed, in, furnace, flues, at, the, rammelsberg, in, germany, were, exploited, for, cementation, brass, making, from, around, 1550, eventually, it, was, discovered, that, metallic, zinc, could, be, alloyed, with, copper, to, make, brass, a, process, known, as, speltering, and, by, 1657, the, german, chemist, johann, glauber, had, recognized, that, calamine, was, nothing, else, but, unmeltable, zinc, and, that, zinc, was, a, half, ripe, metal, however, some, earlier, high, zinc, low, iron, brasses, such, as, the, 1530, wightman, brass, memorial, plaque, from, england, may, have, been, made, by, alloying, copper, with, zinc, and, include, traces, of, cadmium, similar, to, those, found, in, some, zinc, ingots, from, china, however, the, cementation, process, was, not, abandoned, and, as, late, as, the, early, 19th, century, there, are, descriptions, of, solid, state, cementation, in, a, domed, furnace, at, around, 900, 950, c, and, lasting, up, to, 10, hours, the, european, brass, industry, continued, to, flourish, into, the, post, medieval, period, buoyed, by, innovations, such, as, the, 16th, century, introduction, of, water, powered, hammers, for, the, production, of, wares, such, as, pots, by, 1559, the, germany, city, of, aachen, alone, was, capable, of, producing, 300, 000, cwt, of, brass, per, year, after, several, false, starts, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, brass, industry, was, also, established, in, england, taking, advantage, of, abundant, supplies, of, cheap, copper, smelted, in, the, new, coal, fired, reverberatory, furnace, in, 1723, bristol, brass, maker, nehemiah, champion, patented, the, use, of, granulated, copper, produced, by, pouring, molten, metal, into, cold, water, this, increased, the, surface, area, of, the, copper, helping, it, react, and, zinc, contents, of, up, to, 33, wt, were, reported, using, this, new, technique, in, 1738, nehemiah, s, son, william, champion, patented, a, technique, for, the, first, industrial, scale, distillation, of, metallic, zinc, known, as, distillation, per, descencum, or, the, english, process, this, local, zinc, was, used, in, speltering, and, allowed, greater, control, over, the, zinc, content, of, brass, and, the, production, of, high, zinc, copper, alloys, which, would, have, been, difficult, or, impossible, to, produce, using, cementation, for, use, in, expensive, objects, such, as, scientific, instruments, clocks, brass, buttons, and, costume, jewelry, however, champion, continued, to, use, the, cheaper, calamine, cementation, method, to, produce, lower, zinc, brass, and, the, archaeological, remains, of, bee, hive, shaped, cementation, furnaces, have, been, identified, at, his, works, at, warmley, by, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, developments, in, cheaper, zinc, distillation, such, as, john, jaques, dony, s, horizontal, furnaces, in, belgium, and, the, reduction, of, tariffs, on, zinc, as, well, as, demand, for, corrosion, resistant, high, zinc, alloys, increased, the, popularity, of, speltering, and, as, a, result, cementation, was, largely, abandoned, by, the, mid, 19th, century
