an, electromagnetic, field, also, em, field, is, a, physical, field, mathematical, functions, of, position, and, time, representing, the, influences, on, and, due, to, electric, charges, the, field, at, any, point, in, space, and, time, can, be, regarded, as, a, combination, of, an, electric, field, and, a, magnetic, field, because, of, the, interrelationship, between, the, fields, a, disturbance, in, the, electric, field, can, create, a, disturbance, in, the, magnetic, field, which, in, turn, affects, the, electric, field, leading, to, an, oscillation, that, propagates, through, space, known, as, an, electromagnetic, wave, the, way, in, which, charges, and, currents, i, e, streams, of, charges, interact, with, the, electromagnetic, field, is, described, by, maxwell, s, equations, and, the, lorentz, force, law, maxwell, s, equations, detail, how, the, electric, field, converges, towards, or, diverges, away, from, electric, charges, how, the, magnetic, field, curls, around, electrical, currents, and, how, changes, in, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, influence, each, other, the, lorentz, force, law, states, that, a, charge, subject, to, an, electric, field, feels, a, force, along, the, direction, of, the, field, and, a, charge, moving, through, a, magnetic, field, feels, a, force, that, is, perpendicular, both, to, the, magnetic, field, and, to, its, direction, of, motion, the, electromagnetic, field, is, described, by, classical, electrodynamics, an, example, of, a, classical, field, theory, this, theory, describes, many, macroscopic, physical, phenomena, accurately, however, it, was, unable, to, explain, the, photoelectric, effect, and, atomic, absorption, spectroscopy, experiments, at, the, atomic, scale, that, required, the, use, of, quantum, mechanics, specifically, the, quantization, of, the, electromagnetic, field, and, the, development, of, quantum, electrodynamics, the, empirical, investigation, of, electromagnetism, is, at, least, as, old, as, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, mathematician, and, scientist, thales, of, miletus, who, around, 600, bce, described, his, experiments, rubbing, fur, of, animals, on, various, materials, such, as, amber, creating, static, electricity, by, the, 18th, century, it, was, understood, that, objects, can, carry, positive, or, negative, electric, charge, that, two, objects, carrying, charge, of, the, same, sign, repel, each, other, that, two, objects, carrying, charges, of, opposite, sign, attract, one, another, and, that, the, strength, of, this, force, falls, off, as, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, michael, faraday, visualized, this, in, terms, of, the, charges, interacting, via, the, electric, field, an, electric, field, is, produced, when, the, charge, is, stationary, with, respect, to, an, observer, measuring, the, properties, of, the, charge, and, a, magnetic, field, as, well, as, an, electric, field, are, produced, when, the, charge, moves, creating, an, electric, current, with, respect, to, this, observer, over, time, it, was, realized, that, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, better, thought, of, as, two, parts, of, a, greater, whole, the, electromagnetic, field, in, 1820, hans, christian, rsted, showed, that, an, electric, current, can, deflect, a, nearby, compass, needle, establishing, that, electricity, and, magnetism, are, closely, related, phenomena, faraday, then, made, the, seminal, observation, that, time, varying, magnetic, fields, could, induce, electric, currents, in, 1831, in, 1861, james, clerk, maxwell, synthesized, all, the, work, to, date, on, electrical, and, magnetic, phenomena, into, a, single, mathematical, theory, from, which, he, then, deduced, that, light, is, an, electromagnetic, wave, maxwell, s, continuous, field, theory, was, very, successful, until, evidence, supporting, the, atomic, model, of, matter, emerged, beginning, in, 1877, hendrik, lorentz, developed, an, atomic, model, of, electromagnetism, and, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, completed, experiments, that, defined, the, electron, the, lorentz, theory, works, for, free, charges, in, electromagnetic, fields, but, fails, to, predict, the, energy, spectrum, for, bound, charges, in, atoms, and, molecules, for, that, problem, quantum, mechanics, is, needed, ultimately, leading, to, the, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, practical, applications, of, the, new, understanding, of, electromagnetic, fields, emerged, in, the, late, 1800s, the, electrical, generator, and, motor, were, invented, using, only, the, empirical, findings, like, faraday, s, and, ampere, s, laws, combined, with, practical, experience, there, are, different, mathematical, ways, of, representing, the, electromagnetic, field, the, first, one, views, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, as, three, dimensional, vector, fields, these, vector, fields, each, have, a, value, defined, at, every, point, of, space, and, time, and, are, thus, often, regarded, as, functions, of, the, space, and, time, coordinates, as, such, they, are, often, written, as, e, x, y, z, t, electric, field, and, b, x, y, z, t, magnetic, field, if, only, the, electric, field, e, is, non, zero, and, is, constant, in, time, the, field, is, said, to, be, an, electrostatic, field, similarly, if, only, the, magnetic, field, b, is, non, zero, and, is, constant, in, time, the, field, is, said, to, be, a, magnetostatic, field, however, if, either, the, electric, or, magnetic, field, has, a, time, dependence, then, both, fields, must, be, considered, together, as, a, coupled, electromagnetic, field, using, maxwell, s, equations, with, the, advent, of, special, relativity, physical, laws, became, amenable, to, the, formalism, of, tensors, maxwell, s, equations, can, be, written, in, tensor, form, generally, viewed, by, physicists, as, a, more, elegant, means, of, expressing, physical, laws, the, behavior, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, whether, in, cases, of, electrostatics, magnetostatics, or, electrodynamics, electromagnetic, fields, is, governed, by, maxwell, s, equations, in, the, vector, field, formalism, these, are, where, displaystyle, rho, is, the, charge, density, which, is, a, function, of, time, and, position, 0, displaystyle, varepsilon, 0, is, the, vacuum, permittivity, 0, displaystyle, mu, 0, is, the, vacuum, permeability, and, j, is, the, current, density, vector, also, a, function, of, time, and, position, inside, a, linear, material, maxwell, s, equations, change, by, switching, the, permeability, and, permittivity, of, free, space, with, the, permeability, and, permittivity, of, the, linear, material, in, question, inside, other, materials, which, possess, more, complex, responses, to, electromagnetic, fields, these, terms, are, often, represented, by, complex, numbers, or, tensors, the, lorentz, force, law, governs, the, interaction, of, the, electromagnetic, field, with, charged, matter, when, a, field, travels, across, to, different, media, the, behavior, of, the, field, changes, according, to, the, properties, of, the, media, the, maxwell, equations, simplify, when, the, charge, density, at, each, point, in, space, does, not, change, over, time, and, all, electric, currents, likewise, remain, constant, all, of, the, time, derivatives, vanish, from, the, equations, leaving, two, expressions, that, involve, the, electric, field, e, 0, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, e, frac, rho, epsilon, 0, and, e, 0, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, e, 0, along, with, two, formulae, that, involve, the, magnetic, field, b, 0, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, b, 0, and, b, 0, j, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, b, mu, 0, mathbf, j, these, expressions, are, the, basic, equations, of, electrostatics, which, focuses, on, situations, where, electrical, charges, do, not, move, and, magnetostatics, the, corresponding, area, of, magnetic, phenomena, whether, a, physical, effect, is, attributable, to, an, electric, field, or, to, a, magnetic, field, is, dependent, upon, the, observer, in, a, way, that, special, relativity, makes, mathematically, precise, for, example, suppose, that, a, laboratory, contains, a, long, straight, wire, that, carries, an, electrical, current, in, the, frame, of, reference, where, the, laboratory, is, at, rest, the, wire, is, motionless, and, electrically, neutral, the, current, composed, of, negatively, charged, electrons, moves, against, a, background, of, positively, charged, ions, and, the, densities, of, positive, and, negative, charges, cancel, each, other, out, a, test, charge, near, the, wire, would, feel, no, electrical, force, from, the, wire, however, if, the, test, charge, is, in, motion, parallel, to, the, current, the, situation, changes, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, test, charge, the, positive, and, negative, charges, in, the, wire, are, moving, at, different, speeds, and, so, the, positive, and, negative, charge, distributions, are, lorentz, contracted, by, different, amounts, consequently, the, wire, has, a, nonzero, net, charge, density, and, the, test, charge, must, experience, a, nonzero, electric, field, and, thus, a, nonzero, force, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, laboratory, there, is, no, electric, field, to, explain, the, test, charge, being, pulled, towards, or, pushed, away, from, the, wire, so, an, observer, in, the, laboratory, rest, frame, concludes, that, a, magnetic, field, must, be, present, in, general, a, situation, that, one, observer, describes, using, only, an, electric, field, will, be, described, by, an, observer, in, a, different, inertial, frame, using, a, combination, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, analogously, a, phenomenon, that, one, observer, describes, using, only, a, magnetic, field, will, be, in, a, relatively, moving, reference, frame, described, by, a, combination, of, fields, the, rules, for, relating, the, fields, required, in, different, reference, frames, are, the, lorentz, transformations, of, the, fields, thus, electrostatics, and, magnetostatics, are, now, seen, as, studies, of, the, static, em, field, when, a, particular, frame, has, been, selected, to, suppress, the, other, type, of, field, and, since, an, em, field, with, both, electric, and, magnetic, will, appear, in, any, other, frame, these, simpler, effects, are, merely, a, consequence, of, different, frames, of, measurement, the, fact, that, the, two, field, variations, can, be, reproduced, just, by, changing, the, motion, of, the, observer, is, further, evidence, that, there, is, only, a, single, actual, field, involved, which, is, simply, being, observed, differently, the, two, maxwell, equations, faraday, s, law, and, the, amp, re, maxwell, law, illustrate, a, very, practical, feature, of, the, electromagnetic, field, faraday, s, law, may, be, stated, roughly, as, a, changing, magnetic, field, inside, a, loop, creates, an, electric, voltage, around, the, loop, this, is, the, principle, behind, the, electric, generator, ampere, s, law, roughly, states, that, an, electrical, current, around, a, loop, creates, a, magnetic, field, through, the, loop, thus, this, law, can, be, applied, to, generate, a, magnetic, field, and, run, an, electric, motor, maxwell, s, equations, can, be, combined, to, derive, wave, equations, the, solutions, of, these, equations, take, the, form, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, in, a, volume, of, space, not, containing, charges, or, currents, free, space, that, is, where, displaystyle, rho, and, j, are, zero, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, satisfy, these, electromagnetic, wave, equations, james, clerk, maxwell, was, the, first, to, obtain, this, relationship, by, his, completion, of, maxwell, s, equations, with, the, addition, of, a, displacement, current, term, to, ampere, s, circuital, law, this, unified, the, physical, understanding, of, electricity, magnetism, and, light, visible, light, is, but, one, portion, of, the, full, range, of, electromagnetic, waves, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, an, electromagnetic, field, very, far, from, currents, and, charges, sources, is, called, electromagnetic, radiation, emr, since, it, radiates, from, the, charges, and, currents, in, the, source, such, radiation, can, occur, across, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, called, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, including, radio, waves, microwave, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, light, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, the, many, commercial, applications, of, these, radiations, are, discussed, in, the, named, and, linked, articles, a, notable, application, of, visible, light, is, that, this, type, of, energy, from, the, sun, powers, all, life, on, earth, that, either, makes, or, uses, oxygen, a, changing, electromagnetic, field, which, is, physically, close, to, currents, and, charges, see, near, and, far, field, for, a, definition, of, close, will, have, a, dipole, characteristic, that, is, dominated, by, either, a, changing, electric, dipole, or, a, changing, magnetic, dipole, this, type, of, dipole, field, near, sources, is, called, an, electromagnetic, near, field, changing, electric, dipole, fields, as, such, are, used, commercially, as, near, fields, mainly, as, a, source, of, dielectric, heating, otherwise, they, appear, parasitically, around, conductors, which, absorb, emr, and, around, antennas, which, have, the, purpose, of, generating, emr, at, greater, distances, changing, magnetic, dipole, fields, i, e, magnetic, near, fields, are, used, commercially, for, many, types, of, magnetic, induction, devices, these, include, motors, and, electrical, transformers, at, low, frequencies, and, devices, such, as, rfid, tags, metal, detectors, and, mri, scanner, coils, at, higher, frequencies, the, potential, effects, of, electromagnetic, fields, on, human, health, vary, widely, depending, on, the, frequency, intensity, of, the, fields, and, the, length, of, the, exposure, low, frequency, low, intensity, and, short, duration, exposure, to, electromagnetic, radiation, is, generally, considered, safe, on, the, other, hand, radiation, from, other, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, such, as, ultraviolet, light, and, gamma, rays, are, known, to, cause, significant, harm, in, some, circumstances
