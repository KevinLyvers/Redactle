inductance, is, the, tendency, of, an, electrical, conductor, to, oppose, a, change, in, the, electric, current, flowing, through, it, the, electric, current, produces, a, magnetic, field, around, the, conductor, the, magnetic, field, strength, depends, on, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, current, and, follows, any, changes, in, the, magnitude, of, the, current, from, faraday, s, law, of, induction, any, change, in, magnetic, field, through, a, circuit, induces, an, electromotive, force, emf, voltage, in, the, conductors, a, process, known, as, electromagnetic, induction, this, induced, voltage, created, by, the, changing, current, has, the, effect, of, opposing, the, change, in, current, this, is, stated, by, lenz, s, law, and, the, voltage, is, called, back, emf, inductance, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, induced, voltage, to, the, rate, of, change, of, current, causing, it, it, is, a, proportionality, constant, that, depends, on, the, geometry, of, circuit, conductors, e, g, cross, section, area, and, length, and, the, magnetic, permeability, of, the, conductor, and, nearby, materials, an, electronic, component, designed, to, add, inductance, to, a, circuit, is, called, an, inductor, it, typically, consists, of, a, coil, or, helix, of, wire, the, term, inductance, was, coined, by, oliver, heaviside, in, may, 1884, as, a, convenient, way, to, refer, to, coefficient, of, self, induction, it, is, customary, to, use, the, symbol, l, displaystyle, l, for, inductance, in, honour, of, the, physicist, heinrich, lenz, in, the, si, system, the, unit, of, inductance, is, the, henry, h, which, is, the, amount, of, inductance, that, causes, a, voltage, of, one, volt, when, the, current, is, changing, at, a, rate, of, one, ampere, per, second, the, unit, is, named, for, joseph, henry, who, discovered, inductance, independently, of, faraday, the, history, of, electromagnetic, induction, a, facet, of, electromagnetism, began, with, observations, of, the, ancients, electric, charge, or, static, electricity, rubbing, silk, on, amber, electric, current, lightning, and, magnetic, attraction, lodestone, understanding, the, unity, of, these, forces, of, nature, and, the, scientific, theory, of, electromagnetism, was, initiated, and, achieved, during, the, 19th, century, electromagnetic, induction, was, first, described, by, michael, faraday, in, 1831, in, faraday, s, experiment, he, wrapped, two, wires, around, opposite, sides, of, an, iron, ring, he, expected, that, when, current, started, to, flow, in, one, wire, a, sort, of, wave, would, travel, through, the, ring, and, cause, some, electrical, effect, on, the, opposite, side, using, a, galvanometer, he, observed, a, transient, current, flow, in, the, second, coil, of, wire, each, time, that, a, battery, was, connected, or, disconnected, from, the, first, coil, this, current, was, induced, by, the, change, in, magnetic, flux, that, occurred, when, the, battery, was, connected, and, disconnected, faraday, found, several, other, manifestations, of, electromagnetic, induction, for, example, he, saw, transient, currents, when, he, quickly, slid, a, bar, magnet, in, and, out, of, a, coil, of, wires, and, he, generated, a, steady, dc, current, by, rotating, a, copper, disk, near, the, bar, magnet, with, a, sliding, electrical, lead, faraday, s, disk, a, current, i, displaystyle, i, flowing, through, a, conductor, generates, a, magnetic, field, around, the, conductor, which, is, described, by, ampere, s, circuital, law, the, total, magnetic, flux, displaystyle, phi, through, a, circuit, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, perpendicular, component, of, the, magnetic, flux, density, and, the, area, of, the, surface, spanning, the, current, path, if, the, current, varies, the, magnetic, flux, displaystyle, phi, through, the, circuit, changes, by, faraday, s, law, of, induction, any, change, in, flux, through, a, circuit, induces, an, electromotive, force, emf, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, in, the, circuit, proportional, to, the, rate, of, change, of, flux, e, t, d, d, t, t, displaystyle, mathcal, e, t, frac, text, d, text, d, t, phi, t, the, negative, sign, in, the, equation, indicates, that, the, induced, voltage, is, in, a, direction, which, opposes, the, change, in, current, that, created, it, this, is, called, lenz, s, law, the, potential, is, therefore, called, a, back, emf, if, the, current, is, increasing, the, voltage, is, positive, at, the, end, of, the, conductor, through, which, the, current, enters, and, negative, at, the, end, through, which, it, leaves, tending, to, reduce, the, current, if, the, current, is, decreasing, the, voltage, is, positive, at, the, end, through, which, the, current, leaves, the, conductor, tending, to, maintain, the, current, self, inductance, usually, just, called, inductance, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, ratio, between, the, induced, voltage, and, the, rate, of, change, of, the, current, v, t, l, d, i, d, t, 1, displaystyle, v, t, l, frac, text, d, i, text, d, t, qquad, qquad, qquad, 1, thus, inductance, is, a, property, of, a, conductor, or, circuit, due, to, its, magnetic, field, which, tends, to, oppose, changes, in, current, through, the, circuit, the, unit, of, inductance, in, the, si, system, is, the, henry, h, named, after, joseph, henry, which, is, the, amount, of, inductance, that, generates, a, voltage, of, one, volt, when, the, current, is, changing, at, a, rate, of, one, ampere, per, second, all, conductors, have, some, inductance, which, may, have, either, desirable, or, detrimental, effects, in, practical, electrical, devices, the, inductance, of, a, circuit, depends, on, the, geometry, of, the, current, path, and, on, the, magnetic, permeability, of, nearby, materials, ferromagnetic, materials, with, a, higher, permeability, like, iron, near, a, conductor, tend, to, increase, the, magnetic, field, and, inductance, any, alteration, to, a, circuit, which, increases, the, flux, total, magnetic, field, through, the, circuit, produced, by, a, given, current, increases, the, inductance, because, inductance, is, also, equal, to, the, ratio, of, magnetic, flux, to, current, l, i, i, displaystyle, l, phi, i, over, i, an, inductor, is, an, electrical, component, consisting, of, a, conductor, shaped, to, increase, the, magnetic, flux, to, add, inductance, to, a, circuit, typically, it, consists, of, a, wire, wound, into, a, coil, or, helix, a, coiled, wire, has, a, higher, inductance, than, a, straight, wire, of, the, same, length, because, the, magnetic, field, lines, pass, through, the, circuit, multiple, times, it, has, multiple, flux, linkages, the, inductance, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, number, of, turns, in, the, coil, assuming, full, flux, linkage, the, inductance, of, a, coil, can, be, increased, by, placing, a, magnetic, core, of, ferromagnetic, material, in, the, hole, in, the, center, the, magnetic, field, of, the, coil, magnetizes, the, material, of, the, core, aligning, its, magnetic, domains, and, the, magnetic, field, of, the, core, adds, to, that, of, the, coil, increasing, the, flux, through, the, coil, this, is, called, a, ferromagnetic, core, inductor, a, magnetic, core, can, increase, the, inductance, of, a, coil, by, thousands, of, times, if, multiple, electric, circuits, are, located, close, to, each, other, the, magnetic, field, of, one, can, pass, through, the, other, in, this, case, the, circuits, are, said, to, be, inductively, coupled, due, to, faraday, s, law, of, induction, a, change, in, current, in, one, circuit, can, cause, a, change, in, magnetic, flux, in, another, circuit, and, thus, induce, a, voltage, in, another, circuit, the, concept, of, inductance, can, be, generalized, in, this, case, by, defining, the, mutual, inductance, m, k, displaystyle, m, k, ell, of, circuit, k, displaystyle, k, and, circuit, displaystyle, ell, as, the, ratio, of, voltage, induced, in, circuit, displaystyle, ell, to, the, rate, of, change, of, current, in, circuit, k, displaystyle, k, this, is, the, principle, behind, a, transformer, the, property, describing, the, effect, of, one, conductor, on, itself, is, more, precisely, called, self, inductance, and, the, properties, describing, the, effects, of, one, conductor, with, changing, current, on, nearby, conductors, is, called, mutual, inductance, if, the, current, through, a, conductor, with, inductance, is, increasing, a, voltage, v, t, displaystyle, v, t, is, induced, across, the, conductor, with, a, polarity, that, opposes, the, current, in, addition, to, any, voltage, drop, caused, by, the, conductor, s, resistance, the, charges, flowing, through, the, circuit, lose, potential, energy, the, energy, from, the, external, circuit, required, to, overcome, this, potential, hill, is, stored, in, the, increased, magnetic, field, around, the, conductor, therefore, an, inductor, stores, energy, in, its, magnetic, field, at, any, given, time, t, displaystyle, t, the, power, p, t, displaystyle, p, t, flowing, into, the, magnetic, field, which, is, equal, to, the, rate, of, change, of, the, stored, energy, u, displaystyle, u, is, the, product, of, the, current, i, t, displaystyle, i, t, and, voltage, v, t, displaystyle, v, t, across, the, conductor, p, t, d, u,

neglecting, resistive, losses, the, energy, u, displaystyle, u, measured, in, joules, in, si, stored, by, an, inductance, with, a, current, i, displaystyle, i, through, it, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, work, required, to, establish, the, current, through, the, inductance, from, zero, and, therefore, the, magnetic, field, this, is, given, by, u, 0, i, l, i, i, d, i, displaystyle, u, int, 0, i, l,

is, stored, as, long, as, the, current, remains, constant, if, the, current, decreases, the, magnetic, field, decreases, inducing, a, voltage, in, the, conductor, in, the, opposite, direction, negative, at, the, end, through, which, current, enters, and, positive, at, the, end, through, which, it, leaves, this, returns, stored, magnetic, energy, to, the, external, circuit, if, ferromagnetic, materials, are, located, near, the, conductor, such, as, in, an, inductor, with, a, magnetic, core, the, constant, inductance, equation, above, is, only, valid, for, linear, regions, of, the, magnetic, flux, at, currents, below, the, level, at, which, the, ferromagnetic, material, saturates, where, the, inductance, is, approximately, constant, if, the, magnetic, field, in, the, inductor, approaches, the, level, at, which, the, core, saturates, the, inductance, begins, to, change, with, current, and, the, integral, equation, must, be, used, when, a, sinusoidal, alternating, current, ac, is, passing, through, a, linear, inductance, the, induced, back, emf, is, also, sinusoidal, if, the, current, through, the, inductance, is, i, t, i, peak, sin, t, displaystyle, i, t, i,

with, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, so, an, inductor, conducts, less, current, for, a, given, applied, ac, voltage, as, the, frequency, increases, because, the, induced, voltage, is, greatest, when, the, current, is, increasing, the, voltage, and, current, waveforms, are, out, of, phase, the, voltage, peaks, occur, earlier, in, each, cycle, than, the, current, peaks, the, phase, difference,

90, in, the, most, general, case, inductance, can, be, calculated, from, maxwell, s, equations, many, important, cases, can, be, solved, using, simplifications, where, high, frequency, currents, are, considered, with, skin, effect, the, surface, current, densities, and, magnetic, field, may, be, obtained, by, solving, the, laplace, equation, where, the, conductors, are, thin, wires, self, inductance, still, depends, on, the, wire, radius, and, the, distribution, of, the, current, in, the, wire, this, current, distribution, is, approximately, constant, on, the, surface, or, in, the, volume, of, the, wire, for, a, wire, radius, much, smaller, than, other, length, scales, as, a, practical, matter, longer, wires, have, more, inductance, and, thicker, wires, have, less, analogous, to, their, electrical, resistance, although, the, relationships, aren, t, linear, and, are, different, in, kind, from, the, relationships, that, length, and, diameter, bear, to, resistance, separating, the, wire, from, the, other, parts, of, the, circuit, introduces, some, unavoidable, error, in, any, formulas, results, these, inductances, are, often, referred, to, as, partial, inductances, in, part, to, encourage, consideration, of, the, other, contributions, to, whole, circuit, inductance, which, are, omitted, for, derivation, of, the, formulas, below, see, rosa, 1908,

case, for, wires, and, rods, disks, or, thick, cylinders, have, slightly, different, formulas, for, sufficiently, high, frequencies, skin, effects, cause, the, interior, currents, to, vanish, leaving, only, the, currents, on, the, surface, of, the, conductor, the, inductance, for, alternating, current, l, ac, displaystyle, l, text, ac, is, then, given, by, a, very, similar, formula, l, ac, 200, nh,

have, an, inductance, of, about, 19, h, if, stretched, out, straight, there, are, two, cases, to, consider, currents, in, the, wires, need, not, be, equal, though, they, often, are, as, in, the, case, of, a, complete, circuit, where, one, wire, is, the, source, and, the, other, the, return, this, is, the, generalized, case, of, the, paradigmatic, two, loop, cylindrical, coil, carrying, a, uniform, low, frequency, current, the, loops, are, independent, closed, circuits, that, can, have, different, lengths, any, orientation, in, space, and, carry, different, currents, nonetheless, the, error, terms, which, are, not, included, in, the, integral, are, only, small, if, the, geometries, of, the, loops, are, mostly, smooth, and, convex, they, must, not, have, too, many, kinks, sharp, corners,

is, valid, only, for, local, circuits, made, of, thin, wires, formally, the, self, inductance, of, a, wire, loop, would, be, given, by, the, above, equation, with, m, n, displaystyle, m, n, however, here, 1, x, x, displaystyle, 1, left, mathbf, x, mathbf, x, right, becomes, infinite, leading, to, a, logarithmically, divergent, integral, this, necessitates, taking, the, finite, wire, radius, a,
