in, physics, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, is, the, form, of, energy, that, it, possesses, due, to, its, motion, in, classical, mechanics, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, non, rotating, object, of, mass, m, traveling, at, a, speed, v, is, 1, 2, m, v, 2, textstyle, frac, 1, 2, mv, 2, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, is, equal, to, the, work, force, f, times, displacement, s, needed, to, achieve, its, stated, velocity, having, gained, this, energy, during, its, acceleration, the, mass, maintains, this, kinetic, energy, unless, its, speed, changes, the, same, amount, of, work, is, done, by, the, object, when, decelerating, from, its, current, speed, to, a, state, of, rest, the, si, unit, of, kinetic, energy, is, the, joule, while, the, english, unit, of, kinetic, energy, is, the, foot, pound, in, relativistic, mechanics, 1, 2, m, v, 2, textstyle, frac, 1, 2, mv, 2, is, a, good, approximation, of, kinetic, energy, only, when, v, is, much, less, than, the, speed, of, light, the, adjective, kinetic, has, its, roots, in, the, greek, word, kinesis, meaning, motion, the, dichotomy, between, kinetic, energy, and, potential, energy, can, be, traced, back, to, aristotle, s, concepts, of, actuality, and, potentiality, the, principle, in, classical, mechanics, that, e, mv, 2, was, first, developed, by, gottfried, leibniz, and, johann, bernoulli, who, described, kinetic, energy, as, the, living, force, vis, viva, 227, willem, s, gravesande, of, the, netherlands, provided, experimental, evidence, of, this, relationship, in, 1722, by, dropping, weights, from, different, heights, into, a, block, of, clay, willem, s, gravesande, determined, that, their, penetration, depth, was, proportional, to, the, square, of, their, impact, speed, milie, du, ch, telet, recognized, the, implications, of, the, experiment, and, published, an, explanation, the, terms, kinetic, energy, and, work, in, their, present, scientific, meanings, date, back, to, the, mid, 19th, century, early, understandings, of, these, ideas, can, be, attributed, to, gaspard, gustave, coriolis, who, in, 1829, published, the, paper, titled, du, calcul, de, l, effet, des, machines, outlining, the, mathematics, of, kinetic, energy, william, thomson, later, lord, kelvin, is, given, the, credit, for, coining, the, term, kinetic, energy, c, 1849, 1851, rankine, who, had, introduced, the, term, potential, energy, in, 1853, and, the, phrase, actual, energy, to, complement, it, later, cites, william, thomson, and, peter, tait, as, substituting, the, word, kinetic, for, actual, energy, occurs, in, many, forms, including, chemical, energy, thermal, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, gravitational, energy, electric, energy, elastic, energy, nuclear, energy, and, rest, energy, these, can, be, categorized, in, two, main, classes, potential, energy, and, kinetic, energy, kinetic, energy, is, the, movement, energy, of, an, object, kinetic, energy, can, be, transferred, between, objects, and, transformed, into, other, kinds, of, energy, kinetic, energy, may, be, best, understood, by, examples, that, demonstrate, how, it, is, transformed, to, and, from, other, forms, of, energy, for, example, a, cyclist, uses, chemical, energy, provided, by, food, to, accelerate, a, bicycle, to, a, chosen, speed, on, a, level, surface, this, speed, can, be, maintained, without, further, work, except, to, overcome, air, resistance, and, friction, the, chemical, energy, has, been, converted, into, kinetic, energy, the, energy, of, motion, but, the, process, is, not, completely, efficient, and, produces, heat, within, the, cyclist, the, kinetic, energy, in, the, moving, cyclist, and, the, bicycle, can, be, converted, to, other, forms, for, example, the, cyclist, could, encounter, a, hill, just, high, enough, to, coast, up, so, that, the, bicycle, comes, to, a, complete, halt, at, the, top, the, kinetic, energy, has, now, largely, been, converted, to, gravitational, potential, energy, that, can, be, released, by, freewheeling, down, the, other, side, of, the, hill, since, the, bicycle, lost, some, of, its, energy, to, friction, it, never, regains, all, of, its, speed, without, additional, pedaling, the, energy, is, not, destroyed, it, has, only, been, converted, to, another, form, by, friction, alternatively, the, cyclist, could, connect, a, dynamo, to, one, of, the, wheels, and, generate, some, electrical, energy, on, the, descent, the, bicycle, would, be, traveling, slower, at, the, bottom, of, the, hill, than, without, the, generator, because, some, of, the, energy, has, been, diverted, into, electrical, energy, another, possibility, would, be, for, the, cyclist, to, apply, the, brakes, in, which, case, the, kinetic, energy, would, be, dissipated, through, friction, as, heat, like, any, physical, quantity, that, is, a, function, of, velocity, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, depends, on, the, relationship, between, the, object, and, the, observer, s, frame, of, reference, thus, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, is, not, invariant, spacecraft, use, chemical, energy, to, launch, and, gain, considerable, kinetic, energy, to, reach, orbital, velocity, in, an, entirely, circular, orbit, this, kinetic, energy, remains, constant, because, there, is, almost, no, friction, in, near, earth, space, however, it, becomes, apparent, at, re, entry, when, some, of, the, kinetic, energy, is, converted, to, heat, if, the, orbit, is, elliptical, or, hyperbolic, then, throughout, the, orbit, kinetic, and, potential, energy, are, exchanged, kinetic, energy, is, greatest, and, potential, energy, lowest, at, closest, approach, to, the, earth, or, other, massive, body, while, potential, energy, is, greatest, and, kinetic, energy, the, lowest, at, maximum, distance, disregarding, loss, or, gain, however, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, and, potential, energy, remains, constant, kinetic, energy, can, be, passed, from, one, object, to, another, in, the, game, of, billiards, the, player, imposes, kinetic, energy, on, the, cue, ball, by, striking, it, with, the, cue, stick, if, the, cue, ball, collides, with, another, ball, it, slows, down, dramatically, and, the, ball, it, hit, accelerates, as, the, kinetic, energy, is, passed, on, to, it, collisions, in, billiards, are, effectively, elastic, collisions, in, which, kinetic, energy, is, preserved, in, inelastic, collisions, kinetic, energy, is, dissipated, in, various, forms, of, energy, such, as, heat, sound, and, binding, energy, breaking, bound, structures, flywheels, have, been, developed, as, a, method, of, energy, storage, this, illustrates, that, kinetic, energy, is, also, stored, in, rotational, motion, several, mathematical, descriptions, of, kinetic, energy, exist, that, describe, it, in, the, appropriate, physical, situation, for, objects, and, processes, in, common, human, experience, the, formula, 1, 2, mv, 2, given, by, classical, mechanics, is, suitable, however, if, the, speed, of, the, object, is, comparable, to, the, speed, of, light, relativistic, effects, become, significant, and, the, relativistic, formula, is, used, if, the, object, is, on, the, atomic, or, sub, atomic, scale, quantum, mechanical, effects, are, significant, and, a, quantum, mechanical, model, must, be, employed, treatments, of, kinetic, energy, depend, upon, the, relative, velocity, of, objects, compared, to, the, fixed, speed, of, light, speeds, experienced, directly, by, humans, are, non, relativisitic, higher, speeds, require, the, theory, of, relativity, in, classical, mechanics, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, point, object, an, object, so, small, that, its, mass, can, be, assumed, to, exist, at, one, point, or, a, non, rotating, rigid, body, depends, on, the, mass, of, the, body, as, well, as, its, speed, the, kinetic, energy, is, equal, to, 1, 2, the, product, of, the, mass, and, the, square, of, the, speed, in, formula, form, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, and, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, speed, magnitude, of, the, velocity, of, the, body, in, si, units, mass, is, measured, in, kilograms, speed, in, metres, per, second, and, the, resulting, kinetic, energy, is, in, joules, for, example, one, would, calculate, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, 80, kg, mass, about, 180, lbs, traveling, at, 18, metres, per, second, about, 40, mph, or, 65, km, h, as, when, a, person, throws, a, ball, the, person, does, work, on, it, to, give, it, speed, as, it, leaves, the, hand, the, moving, ball, can, then, hit, something, and, push, it, doing, work, on, what, it, hits, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, moving, object, is, equal, to, the, work, required, to, bring, it, from, rest, to, that, speed, or, the, work, the, object, can, do, while, being, brought, to, rest, net, force, displacement, kinetic, energy, i, e, since, the, kinetic, energy, increases, with, the, square, of, the, speed, an, object, doubling, its, speed, has, four, times, as, much, kinetic, energy, for, example, a, car, traveling, twice, as, fast, as, another, requires, four, times, as, much, distance, to, stop, assuming, a, constant, braking, force, as, a, consequence, of, this, quadrupling, it, takes, four, times, the, work, to, double, the, speed, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, is, related, to, its, momentum, by, the, equation, where, for, the, translational, kinetic, energy, that, is, the, kinetic, energy, associated, with, rectilinear, motion, of, a, rigid, body, with, constant, mass, m, displaystyle, m, whose, center, of, mass, is, moving, in, a, straight, line, with, speed, v, displaystyle, v, as, seen, above, is, equal, to, where, the, kinetic, energy, of, any, entity, depends, on, the, reference, frame, in, which, it, is, measured, however, the, total, energy, of, an, isolated, system, i, e, one, in, which, energy, can, neither, enter, nor, leave, does, not, change, over, time, in, the, reference, frame, in, which, it, is, measured, thus, the, chemical, energy, converted, to, kinetic, energy, by, a, rocket, engine, is, divided, differently, between, the, rocket, ship, and, its, exhaust, stream, depending, upon, the, chosen, reference, frame, this, is, called, the, oberth, effect, but, the, total, energy, of, the, system, including, kinetic, energy, fuel, chemical, energy, heat, etc, is, conserved, over, time, regardless, of, the, choice, of, reference, frame, different, observers, moving, with, different, reference, frames, would, however, disagree, on, the, value, of, this, conserved, energy, the, kinetic, energy, of, such, systems, depends, on, the, choice, of, reference, frame, the, reference, frame, that, gives, the, minimum, value, of, that, energy, is, the, center, of, momentum, frame, i, e, the, reference, frame, in, which, the, total, momentum, of, the, system, is, zero, this, minimum, kinetic, energy, contributes, to, the, invariant, mass, of, the, system, as, a, whole, the, work, w, done, by, a, force, f, on, an, object, over, a, distance, s, parallel, to, f, equals, using, newton, s, second, law, with, m, the, mass, and, a, the, acceleration, of, the, object, and, the, distance, traveled, by, the, accelerated, object, in, time, t, we, find, with, v, a, t, displaystyle, v, at, for, the, velocity, v, of, the, object, the, work, done, in, accelerating, a, particle, with, mass, m, during, the, infinitesimal, time, interval, dt, is, given, by, the, dot, product, of, force, f, and, the, infinitesimal, displacement, d, x, where, we, have, assumed, the, relationship, p, m, v, and, the, validity, of, newton, s, second, law, however, also, see, the, special, relativistic, derivation, below, applying, the, product, rule, we, see, that, therefore, assuming, constant, mass, so, that, dm, 0, we, have, since, this, is, a, total, differential, that, is, it, only, depends, on, the, final, state, not, how, the, particle, got, there, we, can, integrate, it, and, call, the, result, kinetic, energy, this, equation, states, that, the, kinetic, energy, e, k, is, equal, to, the, integral, of, the, dot, product, of, the, momentum, p, of, a, body, and, the, infinitesimal, change, of, the, velocity, v, of, the, body, it, is, assumed, that, the, body, starts, with, no, kinetic, energy, when, it, is, at, rest, motionless, if, a, rigid, body, q, is, rotating, about, any, line, through, the, center, of, mass, then, it, has, rotational, kinetic, energy, e, r, displaystyle, e, text, r, which, is, simply, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, its, moving, parts, and, is, thus, given, by, where, in, this, equation, the, moment, of, inertia, must, be, taken, about, an, axis, through, the, center, of, mass, and, the, rotation, measured, by, must, be, around, that, axis, more, general, equations, exist, for, systems, where, the, object, is, subject, to, wobble, due, to, its, eccentric, shape, a, system, of, bodies, may, have, internal, kinetic, energy, due, to, the, relative, motion, of, the, bodies, in, the, system, for, example, in, the, solar, system, the, planets, and, planetoids, are, orbiting, the, sun, in, a, tank, of, gas, the, molecules, are, moving, in, all, directions, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, system, is, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, the, bodies, it, contains, a, macroscopic, body, that, is, stationary, i, e, a, reference, frame, has, been, chosen, to, correspond, to, the, body, s, center, of, momentum, may, have, various, kinds, of, internal, energy, at, the, molecular, or, atomic, level, which, may, be, regarded, as, kinetic, energy, due, to, molecular, translation, rotation, and, vibration, electron, translation, and, spin, and, nuclear, spin, these, all, contribute, to, the, body, s, mass, as, provided, by, the, special, theory, of, relativity, when, discussing, movements, of, a, macroscopic, body, the, kinetic, energy, referred, to, is, usually, that, of, the, macroscopic, movement, only, however, all, internal, energies, of, all, types, contribute, to, a, body, s, mass, inertia, and, total, energy, in, fluid, dynamics, the, kinetic, energy, per, unit, volume, at, each, point, in, an, incompressible, fluid, flow, field, is, called, the, dynamic, pressure, at, that, point, dividing, by, v, the, unit, of, volume, where, q, displaystyle, q, is, the, dynamic, pressure, and, is, the, density, of, the, incompressible, fluid, the, speed, and, thus, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, single, object, is, frame, dependent, relative, it, can, take, any, non, negative, value, by, choosing, a, suitable, inertial, frame, of, reference, for, example, a, bullet, passing, an, observer, has, kinetic, energy, in, the, reference, frame, of, this, observer, the, same, bullet, is, stationary, to, an, observer, moving, with, the, same, velocity, as, the, bullet, and, so, has, zero, kinetic, energy, by, contrast, the, total, kinetic, energy, of, a, system, of, objects, cannot, be, reduced, to, zero, by, a, suitable, choice, of, the, inertial, reference, frame, unless, all, the, objects, have, the, same, velocity, in, any, other, case, the, total, kinetic, energy, has, a, non, zero, minimum, as, no, inertial, reference, frame, can, be, chosen, in, which, all, the, objects, are, stationary, this, minimum, kinetic, energy, contributes, to, the, system, s, invariant, mass, which, is, independent, of, the, reference, frame, the, total, kinetic, energy, of, a, system, depends, on, the, inertial, frame, of, reference, it, is, the, sum, of, the, total, kinetic, energy, in, a, center, of, momentum, frame, and, the, kinetic, energy, the, total, mass, would, have, if, it, were, concentrated, in, the, center, of, mass, this, may, be, simply, shown, let, v, displaystyle, textstyle, mathbf, v, be, the, relative, velocity, of, the, center, of, mass, frame, i, in, the, frame, k, since, then, however, let, v, i, 2, 2, d, m, e, i, textstyle, int, frac, v, i, 2, 2, dm, e, i, the, kinetic, energy, in, the, center, of, mass, frame, v, i, d, m, textstyle, int, mathbf, v, i, dm, would, be, simply, the, total, momentum, that, is, by, definition, zero, in, the, center, of, mass, frame, and, let, the, total, mass, d, m, m, textstyle, int, dm, m, substituting, we, get, thus, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, system, is, lowest, to, center, of, momentum, reference, frames, i, e, frames, of, reference, in, which, the, center, of, mass, is, stationary, either, the, center, of, mass, frame, or, any, other, center, of, momentum, frame, in, any, different, frame, of, reference, there, is, additional, kinetic, energy, corresponding, to, the, total, mass, moving, at, the, speed, of, the, center, of, mass, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, system, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, is, a, quantity, that, is, invariant, all, observers, see, it, to, be, the, same, it, sometimes, is, convenient, to, split, the, total, kinetic, energy, of, a, body, into, the, sum, of, the, body, s, center, of, mass, translational, kinetic, energy, and, the, energy, of, rotation, around, the, center, of, mass, rotational, energy, where, thus, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, tennis, ball, in, flight, is, the, kinetic, energy, due, to, its, rotation, plus, the, kinetic, energy, due, to, its, translation, if, a, body, s, speed, is, a, significant, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, it, is, necessary, to, use, relativistic, mechanics, to, calculate, its, kinetic, energy, in, relativity, the, total, energy, is, given, by, the, energy, momentum, relation, e, 2, p, c, 2, m, 0, c, 2, 2, displaystyle, e, 2, p, textrm, c, 2, left, m, 0, textrm, c, 2, right, 2, here, we, use, the, relativistic, expression, for, linear, momentum, p, m, v, displaystyle, p, m, gamma, v, where, 1, 1, v, 2, c, 2, textstyle, gamma, 1, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, with, m, displaystyle, m, being, an, object, s, rest, mass, v, displaystyle, v, speed, and, c, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, then, kinetic, energy, is, the, total, relativistic, energy, minus, the, rest, energy, e, k, e, m, 0, c, 2, p, c, 2, m, 0, c, 2, 2, m, 0, c, 2, displaystyle, e, k, e, m, 0, c, 2, sqrt, p, textrm, c, 2, left, m, 0, textrm, c, 2, right, 2, m, 0, c, 2, at, low, speeds, the, square, root, can, be, expanded, and, the, rest, energy, drops, out, giving, the, newtonian, kinetic, energy, start, with, the, expression, for, linear, momentum, p, m, v, displaystyle, mathbf, p, m, gamma, mathbf, v, where, 1, 1, v, 2, c, 2, textstyle, gamma, 1, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, integrating, by, parts, yields, since, 1, v, 2, c, 2, 1, 2, displaystyle, gamma, left, 1, v, 2, c, 2, right, frac, 1, 2, e, 0, displaystyle, e, 0, is, a, constant, of, integration, for, the, indefinite, integral, simplifying, the, expression, we, obtain, e, 0, displaystyle, e, 0, is, found, by, observing, that, when, v, 0, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, v, 0, gamma, 1, and, e, k, 0, displaystyle, e, text, k, 0, giving, resulting, in, the, formula, this, formula, shows, that, the, work, expended, accelerating, an, object, from, rest, approaches, infinity, as, the, velocity, approaches, the, speed, of, light, thus, it, is, impossible, to, accelerate, an, object, across, this, boundary, the, mathematical, by, product, of, this, calculation, is, the, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, the, body, at, rest, must, have, energy, content, at, a, low, speed, v, c, the, relativistic, kinetic, energy, is, approximated, well, by, the, classical, kinetic, energy, this, is, done, by, binomial, approximation, or, by, taking, the, first, two, terms, of, the, taylor, expansion, for, the, reciprocal, square, root, so, the, total, energy, e, k, displaystyle, e, k, can, be, partitioned, into, the, rest, mass, energy, plus, the, non, relativistic, kinetic, energy, at, low, speeds, when, objects, move, at, a, speed, much, slower, than, light, e, g, in, everyday, phenomena, on, earth, the, first, two, terms, of, the, series, predominate, the, next, term, in, the, taylor, series, approximation, is, small, for, low, speeds, for, example, for, a, speed, of, 10, km, s, 22, 000, mph, the, correction, to, the, non, relativistic, kinetic, energy, is, 0, 0417, j, kg, on, a, non, relativistic, kinetic, energy, of, 50, mj, kg, and, for, a, speed, of, 100, km, s, it, is, 417, j, kg, on, a, non, relativistic, kinetic, energy, of, 5, gj, kg, the, relativistic, relation, between, kinetic, energy, and, momentum, is, given, by, this, can, also, be, expanded, as, a, taylor, series, the, first, term, of, which, is, the, simple, expression, from, newtonian, mechanics, this, suggests, that, the, formulae, for, energy, and, momentum, are, not, special, and, axiomatic, but, concepts, emerging, from, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, and, the, principles, of, relativity, using, the, convention, that, where, the, four, velocity, of, a, particle, is, and, displaystyle, tau, is, the, proper, time, of, the, particle, there, is, also, an, expression, for, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, in, general, relativity, if, the, particle, has, momentum, as, it, passes, by, an, observer, with, four, velocity, u, obs, then, the, expression, for, total, energy, of, the, particle, as, observed, measured, in, a, local, inertial, frame, is, and, the, kinetic, energy, can, be, expressed, as, the, total, energy, minus, the, rest, energy, consider, the, case, of, a, metric, that, is, diagonal, and, spatially, isotropic, g, tt, g, ss, g, ss, g, ss, since, where, v, is, the, ordinary, velocity, measured, w, r, t, the, coordinate, system, we, get, solving, for, u, t, gives, thus, for, a, stationary, observer, v, 0, and, thus, the, kinetic, energy, takes, the, form, factoring, out, the, rest, energy, gives, this, expression, reduces, to, the, special, relativistic, case, for, the, flat, space, metric, where, in, the, newtonian, approximation, to, general, relativity, where, is, the, newtonian, gravitational, potential, this, means, clocks, run, slower, and, measuring, rods, are, shorter, near, massive, bodies, in, quantum, mechanics, observables, like, kinetic, energy, are, represented, as, operators, for, one, particle, of, mass, m, the, kinetic, energy, operator, appears, as, a, term, in, the, hamiltonian, and, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, more, fundamental, momentum, operator, p, displaystyle, hat, p, the, kinetic, energy, operator, in, the, non, relativistic, case, can, be, written, as, notice, that, this, can, be, obtained, by, replacing, p, displaystyle, p, by, p, displaystyle, hat, p, in, the, classical, expression, for, kinetic, energy, in, terms, of, momentum, in, the, schr, dinger, picture, p, displaystyle, hat, p, takes, the, form, i, displaystyle, i, hbar, nabla, where, the, derivative, is, taken, with, respect, to, position, coordinates, and, hence, the, expectation, value, of, the, electron, kinetic, energy, t, displaystyle, left, langle, hat, t, right, rangle, for, a, system, of, n, electrons, described, by, the, wavefunction, displaystyle, vert, psi, rangle, is, a, sum, of, 1, electron, operator, expectation, values, where, m, e, displaystyle, m, text, e, is, the, mass, of, the, electron, and, i, 2, displaystyle, nabla, i, 2, is, the, laplacian, operator, acting, upon, the, coordinates, of, the, i, th, electron, and, the, summation, runs, over, all, electrons, the, density, functional, formalism, of, quantum, mechanics, requires, knowledge, of, the, electron, density, only, i, e, it, formally, does, not, require, knowledge, of, the, wavefunction, given, an, electron, density, r, displaystyle, rho, mathbf, r, the, exact, n, electron, kinetic, energy, functional, is, unknown, however, for, the, specific, case, of, a, 1, electron, system, the, kinetic, energy, can, be, written, as, where, t, displaystyle, t, is, known, as, the, von, weizs, cker, kinetic, energy, functional
