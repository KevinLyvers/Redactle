in, chemistry, and, atomic, physics, an, electron, shell, may, be, thought, of, as, an, orbit, that, electrons, follow, around, an, atom, s, nucleus, the, closest, shell, to, the, nucleus, is, called, the, 1, shell, also, called, the, k, shell, followed, by, the, 2, shell, or, l, shell, then, the, 3, shell, or, m, shell, and, so, on, farther, and, farther, from, the, nucleus, the, shells, correspond, to, the, principal, quantum, numbers, n, 1, 2, 3, 4, or, are, labeled, alphabetically, with, the, letters, used, in, x, ray, notation, k, l, m, a, useful, guide, when, understanding, electron, shells, in, atoms, is, to, note, that, each, row, on, the, conventional, periodic, table, of, elements, represents, an, electron, shell, each, shell, can, contain, only, a, fixed, number, of, electrons, the, first, shell, can, hold, up, to, two, electrons, the, second, shell, can, hold, up, to, eight, electrons, the, third, shell, can, hold, up, to, 18, continiuing, as, the, general, formula, of, the, n, th, shell, being, able, to, hold, up, to, 2, n, 2, electrons, for, an, explanation, of, why, electrons, exist, in, these, shells, see, electron, configuration, each, shell, consists, of, one, or, more, subshells, and, each, subshell, consists, of, one, or, more, atomic, orbitals, in, 1913, niels, bohr, proposed, a, model, of, the, atom, giving, the, arrangement, of, electrons, in, their, sequential, orbits, at, that, time, bohr, allowed, the, capacity, of, the, inner, orbit, of, the, atom, to, increase, to, eight, electrons, as, the, atoms, got, larger, and, in, the, scheme, given, below, the, number, of, electrons, in, this, ring, is, arbitrary, put, equal, to, the, normal, valency, of, the, corresponding, element, using, these, and, other, constraints, he, proposed, configurations, that, are, in, accord, with, those, now, known, only, for, the, first, six, elements, from, the, above, we, are, led, to, the, following, possible, scheme, for, the, arrangement, of, the, electrons, in, light, atoms, the, shell, terminology, comes, from, arnold, sommerfeld, s, modification, of, the, 1913, bohr, model, during, this, period, bohr, was, working, with, walther, kossel, whose, papers, in, 1914, and, in, 1916, called, the, orbits, shells, sommerfeld, retained, bohr, s, planetary, model, but, added, mildly, elliptical, orbits, characterized, by, additional, quantum, numbers, and, m, to, explain, the, fine, spectroscopic, structure, of, some, elements, the, multiple, electrons, with, the, same, principal, quantum, number, n, had, close, orbits, that, formed, a, shell, of, positive, thickness, instead, of, the, circular, orbit, of, bohr, s, model, which, orbits, called, rings, were, described, by, a, plane, the, existence, of, electron, shells, was, first, observed, experimentally, in, charles, barkla, s, and, henry, moseley, s, x, ray, absorption, studies, moseley, s, work, did, not, directly, concern, the, study, of, electron, shells, because, he, was, trying, to, prove, that, the, periodic, table, was, not, arranged, by, weight, but, by, the, charge, of, the, protons, in, the, nucleus, however, because, the, number, of, electrons, in, an, electrically, neutral, atom, equals, the, number, of, protons, this, work, was, extremely, important, to, niels, bohr, who, mentioned, moseley, s, work, several, times, in, his, 1962, interview, moseley, was, part, of, rutherford, s, group, as, was, niels, bohr, moseley, measured, the, frequencies, of, x, rays, emitted, by, every, element, between, calcium, and, zinc, and, found, that, the, frequencies, became, greater, as, the, elements, got, heavier, this, led, to, the, theory, that, electrons, were, emitting, x, rays, when, they, were, shifted, to, lower, shells, this, led, to, the, conclusion, that, the, electrons, were, in, kossel, s, shells, with, a, definite, limit, per, shell, labeling, the, shells, with, the, letters, k, l, m, n, o, p, and, q, the, origin, of, this, terminology, was, alphabetic, barkla, who, worked, independently, from, moseley, as, an, x, ray, spectrometry, experimentalist, first, noticed, two, distinct, types, of, scattering, from, shooting, x, rays, at, elements, in, 1909, and, named, them, a, and, b, barkla, described, these, two, types, of, x, ray, diffraction, the, first, was, unconnected, with, the, type, of, material, used, in, the, experiment, and, could, be, polarized, the, second, diffraction, beam, he, called, fluorescent, because, it, depended, on, the, irradiated, material, it, was, not, known, what, these, lines, meant, at, the, time, but, in, 1911, barkla, decided, there, might, be, scattering, lines, previous, to, a, so, he, began, at, k, however, later, experiments, indicated, that, the, k, absorption, lines, are, produced, by, the, innermost, electrons, these, letters, were, later, found, to, correspond, to, the, n, values, 1, 2, 3, etc, that, were, used, in, the, bohr, model, they, are, used, in, the, spectroscopic, siegbahn, notation, the, work, of, assigning, electrons, to, shells, was, continued, from, 1913, to, 1925, by, many, chemists, and, a, few, physicists, niels, bohr, was, one, of, the, few, physicists, who, followed, the, chemist, s, work, of, defining, the, periodic, table, while, arnold, sommerfeld, worked, more, on, trying, to, make, a, relativistic, working, model, of, the, atom, that, would, explain, the, fine, structure, of, the, spectra, from, a, classical, orbital, physics, standpoint, through, the, atombau, approach, einstein, and, rutherford, who, did, not, follow, chemistry, were, unaware, of, the, chemists, who, were, developing, electron, shell, theories, of, the, periodic, table, from, a, chemistry, point, of, view, such, as, irving, langmuir, charles, bury, j, j, thomson, and, gilbert, lewis, who, all, introduced, corrections, to, bohr, s, model, such, as, a, maximum, of, two, electrons, in, the, first, shell, eight, in, the, next, and, so, on, and, were, responsible, for, explaining, valency, in, the, outer, electron, shells, and, the, building, up, of, atoms, by, adding, electrons, to, the, outer, shells, so, when, bohr, outlined, his, electron, shell, atomic, theory, in, 1922, there, was, no, mathematical, formula, for, the, theory, so, rutherford, said, he, was, hard, put, to, form, an, idea, of, how, you, arrive, at, your, conclusions, einstein, said, of, bohr, s, 1922, paper, that, his, electron, shells, of, the, atoms, together, with, their, significance, for, chemistry, appeared, to, me, like, a, miracle, and, appears, to, me, as, a, miracle, even, today, arnold, sommerfeld, who, had, followed, the, atombau, structure, of, electrons, instead, of, bohr, who, was, familiar, with, the, chemists, views, of, electron, structure, spoke, of, bohr, s, 1921, lecture, and, 1922, article, on, the, shell, model, as, the, greatest, advance, in, atomic, structure, since, 1913, however, the, electron, shell, development, of, niels, bohr, was, basically, the, same, theory, as, that, of, the, chemist, charles, rugeley, bury, in, his, 1921, paper, as, work, continued, on, the, electron, shell, structure, of, the, sommerfeld, bohr, model, sommerfeld, had, introduced, three, quantum, numbers, n, k, and, m, that, described, the, size, of, the, orbit, the, shape, of, the, orbit, and, the, direction, in, which, the, orbit, was, pointing, because, we, use, k, for, the, boltzmann, constant, the, azimuthal, quantum, number, was, changed, to, when, the, modern, quantum, mechanics, theory, was, put, forward, based, on, heisenberg, s, matrix, mechanics, and, schr, dinger, s, wave, equation, these, quantum, numbers, were, kept, in, the, current, quantum, theory, but, were, changed, to, n, being, the, principal, quantum, number, and, m, being, the, magnetic, quantum, number, however, the, final, form, of, the, electron, shell, model, still, in, use, today, for, the, number, of, electrons, in, shells, was, discovered, in, 1923, by, edmund, stoner, who, introduced, the, principle, that, the, n, th, shell, was, described, by, 2, n, 2, seeing, this, in, 1925, wolfgang, pauli, added, a, fourth, quantum, number, spin, during, the, old, quantum, theory, period, of, the, sommerfeld, bohr, solar, system, atom, to, complete, the, modern, electron, shell, theory, each, shell, is, composed, of, one, or, more, subshells, which, are, themselves, composed, of, atomic, orbitals, for, example, the, first, k, shell, has, one, subshell, called, 1s, the, second, l, shell, has, two, subshells, called, 2s, and, 2p, the, third, shell, has, 3s, 3p, and, 3d, the, fourth, shell, has, 4s, 4p, 4d, and, 4f, the, fifth, shell, has, 5s, 5p, 5d, and, 5f, and, can, theoretically, hold, more, in, the, 5g, subshell, that, is, not, occupied, in, the, ground, state, electron, configuration, of, any, known, element, the, various, possible, subshells, are, shown, in, the, following, table, each, subshell, is, constrained, to, hold, 4, 2, electrons, at, most, namely, therefore, the, k, shell, which, contains, only, an, s, subshell, can, hold, up, to, 2, electrons, the, l, shell, which, contains, an, s, and, a, p, can, hold, up, to, 2, 6, 8, electrons, and, so, forth, in, general, the, n, th, shell, can, hold, up, to, 2, n, 2, electrons, although, that, formula, gives, the, maximum, in, principle, in, fact, that, maximum, is, only, achieved, in, known, elements, for, the, first, four, shells, k, l, m, n, no, known, element, has, more, than, 32, electrons, in, any, one, shell, this, is, because, the, subshells, are, filled, according, to, the, aufbau, principle, the, first, elements, to, have, more, than, 32, electrons, in, one, shell, would, belong, to, the, g, block, of, period, 8, of, the, periodic, table, these, elements, would, have, some, electrons, in, their, 5g, subshell, and, thus, have, more, than, 32, electrons, in, the, o, shell, fifth, principal, shell, although, it, is, sometimes, stated, that, all, the, electrons, in, a, shell, have, the, same, energy, this, is, an, approximation, however, the, electrons, in, one, subshell, do, have, exactly, the, same, level, of, energy, with, later, subshells, having, more, energy, per, electron, than, earlier, ones, this, effect, is, great, enough, that, the, energy, ranges, associated, with, shells, can, overlap, the, filling, of, the, shells, and, subshells, with, electrons, proceeds, from, subshells, of, lower, energy, to, subshells, of, higher, energy, this, follows, the, n, rule, which, is, also, commonly, known, as, the, madelung, rule, subshells, with, a, lower, n, value, are, filled, before, those, with, higher, n, values, in, the, case, of, equal, n, values, the, subshell, with, a, lower, n, value, is, filled, first, because, of, this, the, later, shells, are, filled, over, vast, sections, of, the, periodic, table, the, k, shell, fills, in, the, first, period, hydrogen, and, helium, while, the, l, shell, fills, in, the, second, lithium, to, neon, however, the, m, shell, starts, filling, at, sodium, element, 11, but, does, not, finish, filling, till, copper, element, 29, and, the, n, shell, is, even, slower, it, starts, filling, at, potassium, element, 19, but, does, not, finish, filling, till, ytterbium, element, 70, the, o, p, and, q, shells, begin, filling, in, the, known, elements, but, they, are, not, complete, even, at, the, heaviest, known, element, oganesson, element, 118, the, list, below, gives, the, elements, arranged, by, increasing, atomic, number, and, shows, the, number, of, electrons, per, shell, at, a, glance, the, subsets, of, the, list, show, obvious, patterns, in, particular, every, set, of, five, elements, electric, blue, before, each, noble, gas, group, 18, yellow, heavier, than, helium, have, successive, numbers, of, electrons, in, the, outermost, shell, namely, three, to, seven, sorting, the, table, by, chemical, group, shows, additional, patterns, especially, with, respect, to, the, last, two, outermost, shells, elements, 57, to, 71, belong, to, the, lanthanides, while, 89, to, 103, are, the, actinides, the, list, below, is, primarily, consistent, with, the, aufbau, principle, however, there, are, a, number, of, exceptions, to, the, rule, for, example, palladium, atomic, number, 46, has, no, electrons, in, the, fifth, shell, unlike, other, atoms, with, lower, atomic, number, the, elements, past, 108, have, such, short, half, lives, that, their, electron, configurations, have, not, yet, been, measured, and, so, predictions, have, been, inserted, instead
