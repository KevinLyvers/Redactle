mars, is, the, fourth, planet, from, the, sun, the, surface, of, mars, is, orange, red, because, it, is, covered, in, iron, iii, oxide, dust, giving, it, the, nickname, the, red, planet, mars, is, among, the, brightest, objects, in, earth, s, sky, and, its, high, contrast, albedo, features, have, made, it, a, common, subject, for, telescope, viewing, it, is, classified, as, a, terrestrial, planet, and, is, the, second, smallest, of, the, solar, system, s, planets, with, a, diameter, of, 6, 779, km, 4, 212, mi, in, terms, of, orbital, motion, a, martian, solar, day, sol, is, equal, to, 24, 5, hours, and, a, martian, solar, year, is, equal, to, 1, 88, earth, years, 687, earth, days, mars, has, two, natural, satellites, that, are, small, and, irregular, in, shape, phobos, and, deimos, the, relatively, flat, plains, in, northern, parts, of, mars, strongly, contrast, with, the, cratered, terrain, in, southern, highlands, this, terrain, observation, is, known, as, the, martian, dichotomy, mars, hosts, many, enormous, extinct, volcanoes, the, tallest, is, olympus, mons, 21, 9, km, or, 13, 6, mi, tall, and, one, of, the, largest, canyons, in, the, solar, system, valles, marineris, 4, 000, km, or, 2, 500, mi, long, geologically, the, planet, is, fairly, active, with, marsquakes, trembling, underneath, the, ground, dust, devils, sweeping, across, the, landscape, and, cirrus, clouds, carbon, dioxide, is, substantially, present, in, mars, s, polar, ice, caps, and, thin, atmosphere, during, a, year, there, are, large, surface, temperature, swings, on, the, surface, between, 78, 5, c, 109, 3, f, to, 5, 7, c, 42, 3, f, similar, to, earth, s, seasons, as, both, planets, have, significant, axial, tilt, mars, was, formed, approximately, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, during, the, noachian, period, 4, 5, to, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, mars, s, surface, was, marked, by, meteor, impacts, valley, formation, erosion, and, the, possible, presence, of, water, oceans, the, hesperian, period, 3, 5, to, 3, 3, 2, 9, billion, years, ago, was, dominated, by, widespread, volcanic, activity, and, flooding, that, carved, immense, outflow, channels, the, amazonian, period, which, continues, to, the, present, has, been, marked, by, the, wind, as, a, dominant, influence, on, geological, processes, due, to, mars, s, geological, history, the, possibility, of, past, or, present, life, on, mars, remains, of, great, scientific, interest, since, the, late, 20th, century, mars, has, been, explored, by, uncrewed, spacecraft, and, rovers, with, the, first, flyby, by, the, mariner, 4, probe, in, 1965, the, first, orbit, by, the, mars, 2, probe, in, 1971, and, the, first, landing, by, the, viking, 1, probe, in, 1976, as, of, 2023, there, are, at, least, 11, active, probes, orbiting, mars, or, on, the, martian, surface, mars, is, an, attractive, target, for, future, human, exploration, missions, though, in, the, 2020s, no, such, mission, is, planned, scientists, have, theorized, that, during, the, solar, system, s, formation, mars, was, created, as, the, result, of, a, random, process, of, run, away, accretion, of, material, from, the, protoplanetary, disk, that, orbited, the, sun, mars, has, many, distinctive, chemical, features, caused, by, its, position, in, the, solar, system, elements, with, comparatively, low, boiling, points, such, as, chlorine, phosphorus, and, sulfur, are, much, more, common, on, mars, than, on, earth, these, elements, were, probably, pushed, outward, by, the, young, sun, s, energetic, solar, wind, after, the, formation, of, the, planets, the, inner, solar, system, may, have, been, subjected, to, the, so, called, late, heavy, bombardment, about, 60, of, the, surface, of, mars, shows, a, record, of, impacts, from, that, era, whereas, much, of, the, remaining, surface, is, probably, underlain, by, immense, impact, basins, caused, by, those, events, however, more, recent, modeling, has, disputed, the, existence, of, the, late, heavy, bombardment, there, is, evidence, of, an, enormous, impact, basin, in, the, northern, hemisphere, of, mars, spanning, 10, 600, by, 8, 500, kilometres, 6, 600, by, 5, 300, mi, or, roughly, four, times, the, size, of, the, moon, s, south, pole, aitken, basin, which, would, be, the, largest, impact, basin, yet, discovered, if, confirmed, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, basin, was, formed, when, mars, was, struck, by, a, pluto, sized, body, about, four, billion, years, ago, the, event, thought, to, be, the, cause, of, the, martian, hemispheric, dichotomy, created, the, smooth, borealis, basin, that, covers, 40, of, the, planet, a, 2023, study, shows, evidence, based, on, the, orbital, inclination, of, deimos, a, small, moon, of, mars, that, mars, may, once, have, had, a, ring, system, 3, 5, billion, years, to, 4, billion, years, ago, this, ring, system, may, have, been, formed, from, a, moon, 20, times, more, massive, than, phobos, orbiting, mars, billions, of, years, ago, and, phobos, would, be, a, remnant, of, that, ring, the, geological, history, of, mars, can, be, split, into, many, periods, but, the, following, are, the, three, primary, periods, geological, activity, is, still, taking, place, on, mars, the, athabasca, valles, is, home, to, sheet, like, lava, flows, created, about, 200, million, years, ago, water, flows, in, the, grabens, called, the, cerberus, fossae, occurred, less, than, 20, million, years, ago, indicating, equally, recent, volcanic, intrusions, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, has, captured, images, of, avalanches, mars, is, approximately, half, the, diameter, of, earth, with, a, surface, area, only, slightly, less, than, the, total, area, of, earth, s, dry, land, mars, is, less, dense, than, earth, having, about, 15, of, earth, s, volume, and, 11, of, earth, s, mass, resulting, in, about, 38, of, earth, s, surface, gravity, mars, is, the, only, presently, known, example, of, a, desert, planet, a, rocky, planet, with, a, surface, akin, to, that, of, earth, s, hot, deserts, the, red, orange, appearance, of, the, martian, surface, is, caused, by, ferric, oxide, or, rust, it, can, look, like, butterscotch, other, common, surface, colors, include, golden, brown, tan, and, greenish, depending, on, the, minerals, present, like, earth, mars, is, differentiated, into, a, dense, metallic, core, overlaid, by, less, dense, rocky, layers, the, outermost, layer, is, the, crust, which, is, on, average, about, 42, 56, kilometres, 26, 35, mi, thick, with, a, minimum, thickness, of, 6, kilometres, 3, 7, mi, in, isidis, planitia, and, a, maximum, thickness, of, 117, kilometres, 73, mi, in, the, southern, tharsis, plateau, for, comparison, earth, s, crust, averages, 27, 3, 4, 8, km, in, thickness, the, most, abundant, elements, in, the, martian, crust, are, silicon, oxygen, iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and, potassium, mars, is, confirmed, to, be, seismically, active, in, 2019, it, was, reported, that, insight, had, detected, and, recorded, over, 450, marsquakes, and, related, events, beneath, the, crust, is, a, silicate, mantle, responsible, for, many, of, the, tectonic, and, volcanic, features, on, the, planet, s, surface, the, upper, martian, mantle, is, a, low, velocity, zone, where, the, velocity, of, seismic, waves, is, lower, than, surrounding, depth, intervals, the, mantle, appears, to, be, rigid, down, to, the, depth, of, about, 250, km, giving, mars, a, very, thick, lithosphere, compared, to, earth, below, this, the, mantle, gradually, becomes, more, ductile, and, the, seismic, wave, velocity, starts, to, grow, again, the, martian, mantle, does, not, appear, to, have, a, thermally, insulating, layer, analogous, to, earth, s, lower, mantle, instead, below, 1050, km, in, depth, it, becomes, mineralogically, similar, to, earth, s, transition, zone, at, the, bottom, of, the, mantle, lies, a, basal, liquid, silicate, layer, approximately, 150, 180, km, thick, mars, s, iron, and, nickel, core, is, completely, molten, with, no, solid, inner, core, it, is, around, half, of, mars, s, radius, approximately, 1650, 1675, km, and, is, enriched, in, light, elements, such, as, sulfur, oxygen, carbon, and, hydrogen, mars, is, a, terrestrial, planet, with, a, surface, that, consists, of, minerals, containing, silicon, and, oxygen, metals, and, other, elements, that, typically, make, up, rock, the, martian, surface, is, primarily, composed, of, tholeiitic, basalt, although, parts, are, more, silica, rich, than, typical, basalt, and, may, be, similar, to, andesitic, rocks, on, earth, or, silica, glass, regions, of, low, albedo, suggest, concentrations, of, plagioclase, feldspar, with, northern, low, albedo, regions, displaying, higher, than, normal, concentrations, of, sheet, silicates, and, high, silicon, glass, parts, of, the, southern, highlands, include, detectable, amounts, of, high, calcium, pyroxenes, localized, concentrations, of, hematite, and, olivine, have, been, found, much, of, the, surface, is, deeply, covered, by, finely, grained, iron, iii, oxide, dust, although, mars, has, no, evidence, of, a, structured, global, magnetic, field, observations, show, that, parts, of, the, planet, s, crust, have, been, magnetized, suggesting, that, alternating, polarity, reversals, of, its, dipole, field, have, occurred, in, the, past, this, paleomagnetism, of, magnetically, susceptible, minerals, is, similar, to, the, alternating, bands, found, on, earth, s, ocean, floors, one, hypothesis, published, in, 1999, and, re, examined, in, october, 2005, with, the, help, of, the, mars, global, surveyor, is, that, these, bands, suggest, plate, tectonic, activity, on, mars, four, billion, years, ago, before, the, planetary, dynamo, ceased, to, function, and, the, planet, s, magnetic, field, faded, the, phoenix, lander, returned, data, showing, martian, soil, to, be, slightly, alkaline, and, containing, elements, such, as, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and, chlorine, these, nutrients, are, found, in, soils, on, earth, they, are, necessary, for, growth, of, plants, experiments, performed, by, the, lander, showed, that, the, martian, soil, has, a, basic, ph, of, 7, 7, and, contains, 0, 6, perchlorate, by, weight, concentrations, that, are, toxic, to, humans, streaks, are, common, across, mars, and, new, ones, appear, frequently, on, steep, slopes, of, craters, troughs, and, valleys, the, streaks, are, dark, at, first, and, get, lighter, with, age, the, streaks, can, start, in, a, tiny, area, then, spread, out, for, hundreds, of, metres, they, have, been, seen, to, follow, the, edges, of, boulders, and, other, obstacles, in, their, path, the, commonly, accepted, hypotheses, include, that, they, are, dark, underlying, layers, of, soil, revealed, after, avalanches, of, bright, dust, or, dust, devils, several, other, explanations, have, been, put, forward, including, those, that, involve, water, or, even, the, growth, of, organisms, environmental, radiation, levels, on, the, surface, are, on, average, 0, 64, millisieverts, of, radiation, per, day, and, significantly, less, than, the, radiation, of, 1, 84, millisieverts, per, day, or, 22, millirads, per, day, during, the, flight, to, and, from, mars, for, comparison, the, radiation, levels, in, low, earth, orbit, where, earth, s, space, stations, orbit, are, around, 0, 5, millisieverts, of, radiation, per, day, hellas, planitia, has, the, lowest, surface, radiation, at, about, 0, 342, millisieverts, per, day, featuring, lava, tubes, southwest, of, hadriacus, mons, with, potentially, levels, as, low, as, 0, 064, millisieverts, per, day, comparable, to, radiation, levels, during, flights, on, earth, although, better, remembered, for, mapping, the, moon, johann, heinrich, von, m, dler, and, wilhelm, beer, were, the, first, areographers, they, began, by, establishing, that, most, of, mars, s, surface, features, were, permanent, and, by, more, precisely, determining, the, planet, s, rotation, period, in, 1840, m, dler, combined, ten, years, of, observations, and, drew, the, first, map, of, mars, features, on, mars, are, named, from, a, variety, of, sources, albedo, features, are, named, for, classical, mythology, craters, larger, than, roughly, 50, km, are, named, for, deceased, scientists, and, writers, and, others, who, have, contributed, to, the, study, of, mars, smaller, craters, are, named, for, towns, and, villages, of, the, world, with, populations, of, less, than, 100, 000, large, valleys, are, named, for, the, word, mars, or, star, in, various, languages, smaller, valleys, are, named, for, rivers, large, albedo, features, retain, many, of, the, older, names, but, are, often, updated, to, reflect, new, knowledge, of, the, nature, of, the, features, for, example, nix, olympica, the, snows, of, olympus, has, become, olympus, mons, mount, olympus, the, surface, of, mars, as, seen, from, earth, is, divided, into, two, kinds, of, areas, with, differing, albedo, the, paler, plains, covered, with, dust, and, sand, rich, in, reddish, iron, oxides, were, once, thought, of, as, martian, continents, and, given, names, like, arabia, terra, land, of, arabia, or, amazonis, planitia, amazonian, plain, the, dark, features, were, thought, to, be, seas, hence, their, names, mare, erythraeum, mare, sirenum, and, aurorae, sinus, the, largest, dark, feature, seen, from, earth, is, syrtis, major, planum, the, permanent, northern, polar, ice, cap, is, named, planum, boreum, the, southern, cap, is, called, planum, australe, mars, s, equator, is, defined, by, its, rotation, but, the, location, of, its, prime, meridian, was, specified, as, was, earth, s, at, greenwich, by, choice, of, an, arbitrary, point, m, dler, and, beer, selected, a, line, for, their, first, maps, of, mars, in, 1830, after, the, spacecraft, mariner, 9, provided, extensive, imagery, of, mars, in, 1972, a, small, crater, later, called, airy, 0, located, in, the, sinus, meridiani, middle, bay, or, meridian, bay, was, chosen, by, merton, e, davies, harold, masursky, and, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, for, the, definition, of, 0, 0, longitude, to, coincide, with, the, original, selection, because, mars, has, no, oceans, and, hence, no, sea, level, a, zero, elevation, surface, had, to, be, selected, as, a, reference, level, this, is, called, the, areoid, of, mars, analogous, to, the, terrestrial, geoid, zero, altitude, was, defined, by, the, height, at, which, there, is, 610, 5, pa, 6, 105, mbar, of, atmospheric, pressure, this, pressure, corresponds, to, the, triple, point, of, water, and, it, is, about, 0, 6, of, the, sea, level, surface, pressure, on, earth, 0, 006, atm, for, mapping, purposes, the, united, states, geological, survey, divides, the, surface, of, mars, into, thirty, cartographic, quadrangles, each, named, for, a, classical, albedo, feature, it, contains, in, april, 2023, the, new, york, times, reported, an, updated, global, map, of, mars, based, on, images, from, the, hope, spacecraft, a, related, but, much, more, detailed, global, mars, map, was, released, by, nasa, on, 16, april, 2023, the, vast, upland, region, tharsis, contains, several, massive, volcanoes, which, include, the, shield, volcano, olympus, mons, the, edifice, is, over, 600, km, 370, mi, wide, because, the, mountain, is, so, large, with, complex, structure, at, its, edges, giving, a, definite, height, to, it, is, difficult, its, local, relief, from, the, foot, of, the, cliffs, which, form, its, northwest, margin, to, its, peak, is, over, 21, km, 13, mi, a, little, over, twice, the, height, of, mauna, kea, as, measured, from, its, base, on, the, ocean, floor, the, total, elevation, change, from, the, plains, of, amazonis, planitia, over, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, to, the, northwest, to, the, summit, approaches, 26, km, 16, mi, roughly, three, times, the, height, of, mount, everest, which, in, comparison, stands, at, just, over, 8, 8, kilometres, 5, 5, mi, consequently, olympus, mons, is, either, the, tallest, or, second, tallest, mountain, in, the, solar, system, the, only, known, mountain, which, might, be, taller, is, the, rheasilvia, peak, on, the, asteroid, vesta, at, 20, 25, km, 12, 16, mi, the, dichotomy, of, martian, topography, is, striking, northern, plains, flattened, by, lava, flows, contrast, with, the, southern, highlands, pitted, and, cratered, by, ancient, impacts, it, is, possible, that, four, billion, years, ago, the, northern, hemisphere, of, mars, was, struck, by, an, object, one, tenth, to, two, thirds, the, size, of, earth, s, moon, if, this, is, the, case, the, northern, hemisphere, of, mars, would, be, the, site, of, an, impact, crater, 10, 600, by, 8, 500, kilometres, 6, 600, by, 5, 300, mi, in, size, or, roughly, the, area, of, europe, asia, and, australia, combined, surpassing, utopia, planitia, and, the, moon, s, south, pole, aitken, basin, as, the, largest, impact, crater, in, the, solar, system, mars, is, scarred, by, a, number, of, impact, craters, a, total, of, 43, 000, observed, craters, with, a, diameter, of, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, or, greater, have, been, found, the, largest, exposed, crater, is, hellas, which, is, 2, 300, kilometres, 1, 400, mi, wide, and, 7, 000, metres, 23, 000, ft, deep, and, is, a, light, albedo, feature, clearly, visible, from, earth, there, are, other, notable, impact, features, such, as, argyre, which, is, around, 1, 800, kilometres, 1, 100, mi, in, diameter, and, isidis, which, is, around, 1, 500, kilometres, 930, mi, in, diameter, due, to, the, smaller, mass, and, size, of, mars, the, probability, of, an, object, colliding, with, the, planet, is, about, half, that, of, earth, mars, is, located, closer, to, the, asteroid, belt, so, it, has, an, increased, chance, of, being, struck, by, materials, from, that, source, mars, is, more, likely, to, be, struck, by, short, period, comets, i, e, those, that, lie, within, the, orbit, of, jupiter, martian, craters, can, have, a, morphology, that, suggests, the, ground, became, wet, after, the, meteor, impact, the, large, canyon, valles, marineris, latin, for, mariner, valleys, also, known, as, agathodaemon, in, the, old, canal, maps, has, a, length, of, 4, 000, kilometres, 2, 500, mi, and, a, depth, of, up, to, 7, kilometres, 4, 3, mi, the, length, of, valles, marineris, is, equivalent, to, the, length, of, europe, and, extends, across, one, fifth, the, circumference, of, mars, by, comparison, the, grand, canyon, on, earth, is, only, 446, kilometres, 277, mi, long, and, nearly, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, deep, valles, marineris, was, formed, due, to, the, swelling, of, the, tharsis, area, which, caused, the, crust, in, the, area, of, valles, marineris, to, collapse, in, 2012, it, was, proposed, that, valles, marineris, is, not, just, a, graben, but, a, plate, boundary, where, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, of, transverse, motion, has, occurred, making, mars, a, planet, with, possibly, a, two, tectonic, plate, arrangement, images, from, the, thermal, emission, imaging, system, themis, aboard, nasa, s, mars, odyssey, orbiter, have, revealed, seven, possible, cave, entrances, on, the, flanks, of, the, volcano, arsia, mons, the, caves, named, after, loved, ones, of, their, discoverers, are, collectively, known, as, the, seven, sisters, cave, entrances, measure, from, 100, to, 252, metres, 328, to, 827, ft, wide, and, they, are, estimated, to, be, at, least, 73, to, 96, metres, 240, to, 315, ft, deep, because, light, does, not, reach, the, floor, of, most, of, the, caves, they, may, extend, much, deeper, than, these, lower, estimates, and, widen, below, the, surface, dena, is, the, only, exception, its, floor, is, visible, and, was, measured, to, be, 130, metres, 430, ft, deep, the, interiors, of, these, caverns, may, be, protected, from, micrometeoroids, uv, radiation, solar, flares, and, high, energy, particles, that, bombard, the, planet, s, surface, mars, lost, its, magnetosphere, 4, billion, years, ago, possibly, because, of, numerous, asteroid, strikes, so, the, solar, wind, interacts, directly, with, the, martian, ionosphere, lowering, the, atmospheric, density, by, stripping, away, atoms, from, the, outer, layer, both, mars, global, surveyor, and, mars, express, have, detected, ionized, atmospheric, particles, trailing, off, into, space, behind, mars, and, this, atmospheric, loss, is, being, studied, by, the, maven, orbiter, compared, to, earth, the, atmosphere, of, mars, is, quite, rarefied, atmospheric, pressure, on, the, surface, today, ranges, from, a, low, of, 30, pa, 0, 0044, psi, on, olympus, mons, to, over, 1, 155, pa, 0, 1675, psi, in, hellas, planitia, with, a, mean, pressure, at, the, surface, level, of, 600, pa, 0, 087, psi, the, highest, atmospheric, density, on, mars, is, equal, to, that, found, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, above, earth, s, surface, the, resulting, mean, surface, pressure, is, only, 0, 6, of, earth, s, 101, 3, kpa, 14, 69, psi, the, scale, height, of, the, atmosphere, is, about, 10, 8, kilometres, 6, 7, mi, which, is, higher, than, earth, s, 6, kilometres, 3, 7, mi, because, the, surface, gravity, of, mars, is, only, about, 38, of, earth, s, the, atmosphere, of, mars, consists, of, about, 96, carbon, dioxide, 1, 93, argon, and, 1, 89, nitrogen, along, with, traces, of, oxygen, and, water, the, atmosphere, is, quite, dusty, containing, particulates, about, 1, 5, m, in, diameter, which, give, the, martian, sky, a, tawny, color, when, seen, from, the, surface, it, may, take, on, a, pink, hue, due, to, iron, oxide, particles, suspended, in, it, the, concentration, of, methane, in, the, martian, atmosphere, fluctuates, from, about, 0, 24, ppb, during, the, northern, winter, to, about, 0, 65, ppb, during, the, summer, estimates, of, its, lifetime, range, from, 0, 6, to, 4, years, so, its, presence, indicates, that, an, active, source, of, the, gas, must, be, present, methane, could, be, produced, by, non, biological, process, such, as, serpentinization, involving, water, carbon, dioxide, and, the, mineral, olivine, which, is, known, to, be, common, on, mars, or, by, martian, life, compared, to, earth, its, higher, concentration, of, atmospheric, co, 2, and, lower, surface, pressure, may, be, why, sound, is, attenuated, more, on, mars, where, natural, sources, are, rare, apart, from, the, wind, using, acoustic, recordings, collected, by, the, perseverance, rover, researchers, concluded, that, the, speed, of, sound, there, is, approximately, 240, m, s, for, frequencies, below, 240, hz, and, 250, m, s, for, those, above, auroras, have, been, detected, on, mars, because, mars, lacks, a, global, magnetic, field, the, types, and, distribution, of, auroras, there, differ, from, those, on, earth, rather, than, being, mostly, restricted, to, polar, regions, as, is, the, case, on, earth, a, martian, aurora, can, encompass, the, planet, in, september, 2017, nasa, reported, radiation, levels, on, the, surface, of, the, planet, mars, were, temporarily, doubled, and, were, associated, with, an, aurora, 25, times, brighter, than, any, observed, earlier, due, to, a, massive, and, unexpected, solar, storm, in, the, middle, of, the, month, mars, has, seasons, alternating, between, its, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, similar, to, on, earth, additionally, the, orbit, of, mars, has, compared, to, earth, s, a, large, eccentricity, and, approaches, perihelion, when, it, is, summer, in, its, southern, hemisphere, and, winter, in, its, northern, and, aphelion, when, it, is, winter, in, its, southern, hemisphere, and, summer, in, its, northern, as, a, result, the, seasons, in, its, southern, hemisphere, are, more, extreme, and, the, seasons, in, its, northern, are, milder, than, would, otherwise, be, the, case, the, summer, temperatures, in, the, south, can, be, warmer, than, the, equivalent, summer, temperatures, in, the, north, by, up, to, 30, c, 54, f, martian, surface, temperatures, vary, from, lows, of, about, 110, c, 166, f, to, highs, of, up, to, 35, c, 95, f, in, equatorial, summer, the, wide, range, in, temperatures, is, due, to, the, thin, atmosphere, which, cannot, store, much, solar, heat, the, low, atmospheric, pressure, about, 1, that, of, the, atmosphere, of, earth, and, the, low, thermal, inertia, of, martian, soil, the, planet, is, 1, 52, times, as, far, from, the, sun, as, earth, resulting, in, just, 43, of, the, amount, of, sunlight, mars, has, the, largest, dust, storms, in, the, solar, system, reaching, speeds, of, over, 160, km, h, 100, mph, these, can, vary, from, a, storm, over, a, small, area, to, gigantic, storms, that, cover, the, entire, planet, they, tend, to, occur, when, mars, is, closest, to, the, sun, and, have, been, shown, to, increase, global, temperature, seasons, also, produce, dry, ice, covering, polar, ice, caps, large, areas, of, the, polar, regions, of, mars, while, mars, contains, water, in, larger, amounts, most, of, it, is, dust, covered, water, ice, at, the, martian, polar, ice, caps, the, volume, of, water, ice, in, the, south, polar, ice, cap, if, melted, would, be, enough, to, cover, most, of, the, surface, of, the, planet, with, a, depth, of, 11, metres, 36, ft, water, in, its, liquid, form, cannot, prevail, on, the, surface, of, mars, due, to, the, low, atmospheric, pressure, on, mars, which, is, less, than, 1, that, of, earth, only, at, the, lowest, of, elevations, pressure, and, temperature, is, high, enough, for, water, being, able, to, be, liquid, for, short, periods, water, in, the, atmosphere, is, small, but, enough, to, produce, larger, clouds, of, water, ice, and, different, cases, of, snow, and, frost, often, mixed, with, snow, of, carbon, dioxide, dry, ice, landforms, visible, on, mars, strongly, suggest, that, liquid, water, has, existed, on, the, planet, s, surface, huge, linear, swathes, of, scoured, ground, known, as, outflow, channels, cut, across, the, surface, in, about, 25, places, these, are, thought, to, be, a, record, of, erosion, caused, by, the, catastrophic, release, of, water, from, subsurface, aquifers, though, some, of, these, structures, have, been, hypothesized, to, result, from, the, action, of, glaciers, or, lava, one, of, the, larger, examples, ma, adim, vallis, is, 700, kilometres, 430, mi, long, much, greater, than, the, grand, canyon, with, a, width, of, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, and, a, depth, of, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, in, places, it, is, thought, to, have, been, carved, by, flowing, water, early, in, mars, s, history, the, youngest, of, these, channels, is, thought, to, have, formed, only, a, few, million, years, ago, elsewhere, particularly, on, the, oldest, areas, of, the, martian, surface, finer, scale, dendritic, networks, of, valleys, are, spread, across, significant, proportions, of, the, landscape, features, of, these, valleys, and, their, distribution, strongly, imply, that, they, were, carved, by, runoff, resulting, from, precipitation, in, early, mars, history, subsurface, water, flow, and, groundwater, sapping, may, play, important, subsidiary, roles, in, some, networks, but, precipitation, was, probably, the, root, cause, of, the, incision, in, almost, all, cases, along, craters, and, canyon, walls, there, are, thousands, of, features, that, appear, similar, to, terrestrial, gullies, the, gullies, tend, to, be, in, the, highlands, of, the, southern, hemisphere, and, face, the, equator, all, are, poleward, of, 30, latitude, a, number, of, authors, have, suggested, that, their, formation, process, involves, liquid, water, probably, from, melting, ice, although, others, have, argued, for, formation, mechanisms, involving, carbon, dioxide, frost, or, the, movement, of, dry, dust, no, partially, degraded, gullies, have, formed, by, weathering, and, no, superimposed, impact, craters, have, been, observed, indicating, that, these, are, young, features, possibly, still, active, other, geological, features, such, as, deltas, and, alluvial, fans, preserved, in, craters, are, further, evidence, for, warmer, wetter, conditions, at, an, interval, or, intervals, in, earlier, mars, history, such, conditions, necessarily, require, the, widespread, presence, of, crater, lakes, across, a, large, proportion, of, the, surface, for, which, there, is, independent, mineralogical, sedimentological, and, geomorphological, evidence, further, evidence, that, liquid, water, once, existed, on, the, surface, of, mars, comes, from, the, detection, of, specific, minerals, such, as, hematite, and, goethite, both, of, which, sometimes, form, in, the, presence, of, water, in, 2004, opportunity, detected, the, mineral, jarosite, this, forms, only, in, the, presence, of, acidic, water, showing, that, water, once, existed, on, mars, the, spirit, rover, found, concentrated, deposits, of, silica, in, 2007, that, indicated, wet, conditions, in, the, past, and, in, december, 2011, the, mineral, gypsum, which, also, forms, in, the, presence, of, water, was, found, on, the, surface, by, nasa, s, mars, rover, opportunity, it, is, estimated, that, the, amount, of, water, in, the, upper, mantle, of, mars, represented, by, hydroxyl, ions, contained, within, martian, minerals, is, equal, to, or, greater, than, that, of, earth, at, 50, 300, parts, per, million, of, water, which, is, enough, to, cover, the, entire, planet, to, a, depth, of, 200, 1, 000, metres, 660, 3, 280, ft, on, 18, march, 2013, nasa, reported, evidence, from, instruments, on, the, curiosity, rover, of, mineral, hydration, likely, hydrated, calcium, sulfate, in, several, rock, samples, including, the, broken, fragments, of, tintina, rock, and, sutton, inlier, rock, as, well, as, in, veins, and, nodules, in, other, rocks, like, knorr, rock, and, wernicke, rock, analysis, using, the, rover, s, dan, instrument, provided, evidence, of, subsurface, water, amounting, to, as, much, as, 4, water, content, down, to, a, depth, of, 60, centimetres, 24, in, during, the, rover, s, traverse, from, the, bradbury, landing, site, to, the, yellowknife, bay, area, in, the, glenelg, terrain, in, september, 2015, nasa, announced, that, they, had, found, strong, evidence, of, hydrated, brine, flows, in, recurring, slope, lineae, based, on, spectrometer, readings, of, the, darkened, areas, of, slopes, these, streaks, flow, downhill, in, martian, summer, when, the, temperature, is, above, 23, c, and, freeze, at, lower, temperatures, these, observations, supported, earlier, hypotheses, based, on, timing, of, formation, and, their, rate, of, growth, that, these, dark, streaks, resulted, from, water, flowing, just, below, the, surface, however, later, work, suggested, that, the, lineae, may, be, dry, granular, flows, instead, with, at, most, a, limited, role, for, water, in, initiating, the, process, a, definitive, conclusion, about, the, presence, extent, and, role, of, liquid, water, on, the, martian, surface, remains, elusive, researchers, suspect, much, of, the, low, northern, plains, of, the, planet, were, covered, with, an, ocean, hundreds, of, meters, deep, though, this, theory, remains, controversial, in, march, 2015, scientists, stated, that, such, an, ocean, might, have, been, the, size, of, earth, s, arctic, ocean, this, finding, was, derived, from, the, ratio, of, protium, to, deuterium, in, the, modern, martian, atmosphere, compared, to, that, ratio, on, earth, the, amount, of, martian, deuterium, d, h, 9, 3, 1, 7, 10, 4, is, five, to, seven, times, the, amount, on, earth, d, h, 1, 56, 10, 4, suggesting, that, ancient, mars, had, significantly, higher, levels, of, water, results, from, the, curiosity, rover, had, previously, found, a, high, ratio, of, deuterium, in, gale, crater, though, not, significantly, high, enough, to, suggest, the, former, presence, of, an, ocean, other, scientists, caution, that, these, results, have, not, been, confirmed, and, point, out, that, martian, climate, models, have, not, yet, shown, that, the, planet, was, warm, enough, in, the, past, to, support, bodies, of, liquid, water, near, the, northern, polar, cap, is, the, 81, 4, kilometres, 50, 6, mi, wide, korolev, crater, which, the, mars, express, orbiter, found, to, be, filled, with, approximately, 2, 200, cubic, kilometres, 530, cu, mi, of, water, ice, in, november, 2016, nasa, reported, finding, a, large, amount, of, underground, ice, in, the, utopia, planitia, region, the, volume, of, water, detected, has, been, estimated, to, be, equivalent, to, the, volume, of, water, in, lake, superior, which, is, 12, 100, cubic, kilometers, during, observations, from, 2018, through, 2021, the, exomars, trace, gas, orbiter, spotted, indications, of, water, probably, subsurface, ice, in, the, valles, marineris, canyon, system, mars, s, average, distance, from, the, sun, is, roughly, 230, million, km, 143, million, mi, and, its, orbital, period, is, 687, earth, days, the, solar, day, or, sol, on, mars, is, only, slightly, longer, than, an, earth, day, 24, hours, 39, minutes, and, 35, 244, seconds, a, martian, year, is, equal, to, 1, 8809, earth, years, or, 1, year, 320, days, and, 18, 2, hours, the, gravitational, potential, difference, and, thus, the, delta, v, needed, to, transfer, between, mars, and, earth, is, the, second, lowest, for, earth, the, axial, tilt, of, mars, is, 25, 19, relative, to, its, orbital, plane, which, is, similar, to, the, axial, tilt, of, earth, as, a, result, mars, has, seasons, like, earth, though, on, mars, they, are, nearly, twice, as, long, because, its, orbital, period, is, that, much, longer, in, the, present, day, the, orientation, of, the, north, pole, of, mars, is, close, to, the, star, deneb, mars, has, a, relatively, pronounced, orbital, eccentricity, of, about, 0, 09, of, the, seven, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, only, mercury, has, a, larger, orbital, eccentricity, it, is, known, that, in, the, past, mars, has, had, a, much, more, circular, orbit, at, one, point, 1, 35, million, earth, years, ago, mars, had, an, eccentricity, of, roughly, 0, 002, much, less, than, that, of, earth, today, mars, s, cycle, of, eccentricity, is, 96, 000, earth, years, compared, to, earth, s, cycle, of, 100, 000, years, mars, has, its, closest, approach, to, earth, opposition, in, a, synodic, period, of, 779, 94, days, it, should, not, be, confused, with, mars, conjunction, where, the, earth, and, mars, are, at, opposite, sides, of, the, solar, system, and, form, a, straight, line, crossing, the, sun, the, average, time, between, the, successive, oppositions, of, mars, its, synodic, period, is, 780, days, but, the, number, of, days, between, successive, oppositions, can, range, from, 764, to, 812, the, distance, at, close, approach, varies, between, about, 54, and, 103, million, km, 34, and, 64, million, mi, due, to, the, planets, elliptical, orbits, which, causes, comparable, variation, in, angular, size, at, their, furthest, mars, and, earth, can, be, as, far, as, 401, million, km, 249, million, mi, apart, mars, comes, into, opposition, from, earth, every, 2, 1, years, the, planets, come, into, opposition, near, mars, s, perihelion, in, 2003, 2018, and, 2035, with, the, 2020, and, 2033, events, being, particularly, close, to, perihelic, opposition, the, mean, apparent, magnitude, of, mars, is, 0, 71, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 1, 05, because, the, orbit, of, mars, is, eccentric, the, magnitude, at, opposition, from, the, sun, can, range, from, about, 3, 0, to, 1, 4, the, minimum, brightness, is, magnitude, 1, 86, when, the, planet, is, near, aphelion, and, in, conjunction, with, the, sun, at, its, brightest, mars, along, with, jupiter, is, second, only, to, venus, in, apparent, brightness, mars, usually, appears, distinctly, yellow, orange, or, red, when, farthest, away, from, earth, it, is, more, than, seven, times, farther, away, than, when, it, is, closest, mars, is, usually, close, enough, for, particularly, good, viewing, once, or, twice, at, 15, year, or, 17, year, intervals, optical, ground, based, telescopes, are, typically, limited, to, resolving, features, about, 300, kilometres, 190, mi, across, when, earth, and, mars, are, closest, because, of, earth, s, atmosphere, as, mars, approaches, opposition, it, begins, a, period, of, retrograde, motion, which, means, it, will, appear, to, move, backwards, in, a, looping, curve, with, respect, to, the, background, stars, this, retrograde, motion, lasts, for, about, 72, days, and, mars, reaches, its, peak, apparent, brightness, in, the, middle, of, this, interval, mars, has, two, relatively, small, compared, to, earth, s, natural, moons, phobos, about, 22, kilometres, 14, mi, in, diameter, and, deimos, about, 12, kilometres, 7, 5, mi, in, diameter, which, orbit, close, to, the, planet, the, origin, of, both, moons, is, unclear, although, a, popular, theory, states, that, they, were, asteroids, captured, into, martian, orbit, both, satellites, were, discovered, in, 1877, by, asaph, hall, and, were, named, after, the, characters, phobos, the, deity, of, panic, and, fear, and, deimos, the, deity, of, terror, and, dread, twins, from, greek, mythology, who, accompanied, their, father, ares, god, of, war, into, battle, mars, was, the, roman, equivalent, to, ares, in, modern, greek, the, planet, retains, its, ancient, name, ares, aris, from, the, surface, of, mars, the, motions, of, phobos, and, deimos, appear, different, from, that, of, the, earth, s, satellite, the, moon, phobos, rises, in, the, west, sets, in, the, east, and, rises, again, in, just, 11, hours, deimos, being, only, just, outside, synchronous, orbit, where, the, orbital, period, would, match, the, planet, s, period, of, rotation, rises, as, expected, in, the, east, but, slowly, because, the, orbit, of, phobos, is, below, a, synchronous, altitude, tidal, forces, from, mars, are, gradually, lowering, its, orbit, in, about, 50, million, years, it, could, either, crash, into, mars, s, surface, or, break, up, into, a, ring, structure, around, the, planet, the, origin, of, the, two, satellites, is, not, well, understood, their, low, albedo, and, carbonaceous, chondrite, composition, have, been, regarded, as, similar, to, asteroids, supporting, a, capture, theory, the, unstable, orbit, of, phobos, would, seem, to, point, toward, a, relatively, recent, capture, but, both, have, circular, orbits, near, the, equator, which, is, unusual, for, captured, objects, and, the, required, capture, dynamics, are, complex, accretion, early, in, the, history, of, mars, is, plausible, but, would, not, account, for, a, composition, resembling, asteroids, rather, than, mars, itself, if, that, is, confirmed, mars, may, have, yet, undiscovered, moons, smaller, than, 50, to, 100, metres, 160, to, 330, ft, in, diameter, and, a, dust, ring, is, predicted, to, exist, between, phobos, and, deimos, a, third, possibility, for, their, origin, as, satellites, of, mars, is, the, involvement, of, a, third, body, or, a, type, of, impact, disruption, more, recent, lines, of, evidence, for, phobos, having, a, highly, porous, interior, and, suggesting, a, composition, containing, mainly, phyllosilicates, and, other, minerals, known, from, mars, point, toward, an, origin, of, phobos, from, material, ejected, by, an, impact, on, mars, that, reaccreted, in, martian, orbit, similar, to, the, prevailing, theory, for, the, origin, of, earth, s, satellite, although, the, visible, and, near, infrared, vnir, spectra, of, the, moons, of, mars, resemble, those, of, outer, belt, asteroids, the, thermal, infrared, spectra, of, phobos, are, reported, to, be, inconsistent, with, chondrites, of, any, class, it, is, also, possible, that, phobos, and, deimos, were, fragments, of, an, older, moon, formed, by, debris, from, a, large, impact, on, mars, and, then, destroyed, by, a, more, recent, impact, upon, the, satellite, the, history, of, observations, of, mars, is, marked, by, oppositions, of, mars, when, the, planet, is, closest, to, earth, and, hence, is, most, easily, visible, which, occur, every, couple, of, years, even, more, notable, are, the, perihelic, oppositions, of, mars, which, are, distinguished, because, mars, is, close, to, perihelion, making, it, even, closer, to, earth, the, ancient, sumerians, named, mars, nergal, the, god, of, war, and, plague, during, sumerian, times, nergal, was, a, minor, deity, of, little, significance, but, during, later, times, his, main, cult, center, was, the, city, of, nineveh, in, mesopotamian, texts, mars, is, referred, to, as, the, star, of, judgement, of, the, fate, of, the, dead, the, existence, of, mars, as, a, wandering, object, in, the, night, sky, was, also, recorded, by, the, ancient, egyptian, astronomers, and, by, 1534, bce, they, were, familiar, with, the, retrograde, motion, of, the, planet, by, the, period, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, the, babylonian, astronomers, were, making, regular, records, of, the, positions, of, the, planets, and, systematic, observations, of, their, behavior, for, mars, they, knew, that, the, planet, made, 37, synodic, periods, or, 42, circuits, of, the, zodiac, every, 79, years, they, invented, arithmetic, methods, for, making, minor, corrections, to, the, predicted, positions, of, the, planets, in, ancient, greece, the, planet, was, known, as, commonly, the, greek, name, for, the, planet, now, referred, to, as, mars, was, ares, it, was, the, romans, who, named, the, planet, mars, for, their, god, of, war, often, represented, by, the, sword, and, shield, of, the, planet, s, namesake, in, the, fourth, century, bce, aristotle, noted, that, mars, disappeared, behind, the, moon, during, an, occultation, indicating, that, the, planet, was, farther, away, ptolemy, a, greek, living, in, alexandria, attempted, to, address, the, problem, of, the, orbital, motion, of, mars, ptolemy, s, model, and, his, collective, work, on, astronomy, was, presented, in, the, multi, volume, collection, later, called, the, almagest, from, the, arabic, for, greatest, which, became, the, authoritative, treatise, on, western, astronomy, for, the, next, fourteen, centuries, literature, from, ancient, china, confirms, that, mars, was, known, by, chinese, astronomers, by, no, later, than, the, fourth, century, bce, in, the, east, asian, cultures, mars, is, traditionally, referred, to, as, the, fire, star, based, on, the, wuxing, system, during, the, seventeenth, century, a, d, tycho, brahe, measured, the, diurnal, parallax, of, mars, that, johannes, kepler, used, to, make, a, preliminary, calculation, of, the, relative, distance, to, the, planet, from, brahe, s, observations, of, mars, kepler, deduced, that, the, planet, orbited, the, sun, not, in, a, circle, but, in, an, ellipse, moreover, kepler, showed, that, mars, sped, up, as, it, approached, the, sun, and, slowed, down, as, it, moved, farther, away, in, a, manner, that, later, physicists, would, explain, as, a, consequence, of, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, 433, 437, when, the, telescope, became, available, the, diurnal, parallax, of, mars, was, again, measured, in, an, effort, to, determine, the, sun, earth, distance, this, was, first, performed, by, giovanni, domenico, cassini, in, 1672, the, early, parallax, measurements, were, hampered, by, the, quality, of, the, instruments, the, only, occultation, of, mars, by, venus, observed, was, that, of, 13, october, 1590, seen, by, michael, maestlin, at, heidelberg, in, 1610, mars, was, viewed, by, italian, astronomer, galileo, galilei, who, was, first, to, see, it, via, telescope, the, first, person, to, draw, a, map, of, mars, that, displayed, any, terrain, features, was, the, dutch, astronomer, christiaan, huygens, by, the, 19th, century, the, resolution, of, telescopes, reached, a, level, sufficient, for, surface, features, to, be, identified, on, 5, september, 1877, a, perihelic, opposition, to, mars, occurred, the, italian, astronomer, giovanni, schiaparelli, used, a, 22, centimetre, 8, 7, in, telescope, in, milan, to, help, produce, the, first, detailed, map, of, mars, these, maps, notably, contained, features, he, called, canali, which, were, later, shown, to, be, an, optical, illusion, these, canali, were, supposedly, long, straight, lines, on, the, surface, of, mars, to, which, he, gave, names, of, famous, rivers, on, earth, his, term, which, means, channels, or, grooves, was, popularly, mistranslated, in, english, as, canals, influenced, by, the, observations, the, orientalist, percival, lowell, founded, an, observatory, which, had, 30, and, 45, centimetre, 12, and, 18, in, telescopes, the, observatory, was, used, for, the, exploration, of, mars, during, the, last, good, opportunity, in, 1894, and, the, following, less, favorable, oppositions, he, published, several, books, on, mars, and, life, on, the, planet, which, had, a, great, influence, on, the, public, the, canali, were, independently, observed, by, other, astronomers, like, henri, joseph, perrotin, and, louis, thollon, in, nice, using, one, of, the, largest, telescopes, of, that, time, the, seasonal, changes, consisting, of, the, diminishing, of, the, polar, caps, and, the, dark, areas, formed, during, martian, summers, in, combination, with, the, canals, led, to, speculation, about, life, on, mars, and, it, was, a, long, held, belief, that, mars, contained, vast, seas, and, vegetation, as, bigger, telescopes, were, used, fewer, long, straight, canali, were, observed, during, observations, in, 1909, by, antoniadi, with, an, 84, centimetre, 33, in, telescope, irregular, patterns, were, observed, but, no, canali, were, seen, dozens, of, crewless, spacecraft, including, orbiters, landers, and, rovers, have, been, sent, to, mars, by, the, soviet, union, the, united, states, europe, india, the, united, arab, emirates, and, china, to, study, the, planet, s, surface, climate, and, geology, nasa, s, mariner, 4, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, visit, mars, launched, on, 28, november, 1964, it, made, its, closest, approach, to, the, planet, on, 15, july, 1965, mariner, 4, detected, the, weak, martian, radiation, belt, measured, at, about, 0, 1, that, of, earth, and, captured, the, first, images, of, another, planet, from, deep, space, once, spacecraft, visited, the, planet, during, nasa, s, mariner, missions, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, many, previous, concepts, of, mars, were, radically, broken, after, the, results, of, the, viking, life, detection, experiments, the, hypothesis, of, a, dead, planet, was, generally, accepted, the, data, from, mariner, 9, and, viking, allowed, better, maps, of, mars, to, be, made, and, the, mars, global, surveyor, mission, which, launched, in, 1996, and, operated, until, late, 2006, produced, complete, extremely, detailed, maps, of, the, martian, topography, magnetic, field, and, surface, minerals, these, maps, are, available, online, at, websites, including, google, mars, both, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, and, mars, express, continued, exploring, with, new, instruments, and, supporting, lander, missions, nasa, provides, two, online, tools, mars, trek, which, provides, visualizations, of, the, planet, using, data, from, 50, years, of, exploration, and, experience, curiosity, which, simulates, traveling, on, mars, in, 3, d, with, curiosity, as, of, 2023, mars, is, host, to, ten, functioning, spacecraft, eight, are, in, orbit, 2001, mars, odyssey, mars, express, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, maven,

planned, missions, to, mars, include, as, of, february, 2024, debris, from, these, types, of, missions, has, reached, over, seven, tons, most, of, it, consists, of, crashed, and, inactive, spacecraft, as, well, as, discarded, components, in, april, 2024, nasa, selected, several, companies, to, begin, studies, on, providing, commercial, services, to, further, enable, robotic, science, on, mars, key, areas, include, establishing, telecommunications, payload, delivery, and, surface, imaging, during, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, widely, accepted, in, the, astronomical, community, that, mars, had, life, supporting, qualities, including, the, presence, of, oxygen, and, water, however, in, 1894, w, w, campbell, at, lick, observatory, observed, the, planet, and, found, that, if, water, vapor, or, oxygen, occur, in, the, atmosphere, of, mars, it, is, in, quantities, too, small, to, be, detected, by, spectroscopes, then, available, that, observation, contradicted, many, of, the, measurements, of, the, time, and, was, not, widely, accepted, campbell, and, v, m, slipher, repeated, the, study, in, 1909, using, better, instruments, but, with, the, same, results, it, was, not, until, the, findings, were, confirmed, by, w, s, adams, in, 1925, that, the, myth, of, the, earth, like, habitability, of, mars, was, finally, broken, however, even, in, the, 1960s, articles, were, published, on, martian, biology, putting, aside, explanations, other, than, life, for, the, seasonal, changes, on, mars, the, current, understanding, of, planetary, habitability, the, ability, of, a, world, to, develop, environmental, conditions, favorable, to, the, emergence, of, life, favors, planets, that, have, liquid, water, on, their, surface, most, often, this, requires, the, orbit, of, a, planet, to, lie, within, the, habitable, zone, which, for, the, sun, is, estimated, to, extend, from, within, the, orbit, of, earth, to, about, that, of, mars, during, perihelion, mars, dips, inside, this, region, but, mars, s, thin, low, pressure, atmosphere, prevents, liquid, water, from, existing, over, large, regions, for, extended, periods, the, past, flow, of, liquid, water, demonstrates, the, planet, s, potential, for, habitability, recent, evidence, has, suggested, that, any, water, on, the, martian, surface, may, have, been, too, salty, and, acidic, to, support, regular, terrestrial, life, the, environmental, conditions, on, mars, are, a, challenge, to, sustaining, organic, life, the, planet, has, little, heat, transfer, across, its, surface, it, has, poor, insulation, against, bombardment, by, the, solar, wind, due, to, the, absence, of, a, magnetosphere, and, has, insufficient, atmospheric, pressure, to, retain, water, in, a, liquid, form, water, instead, sublimes, to, a, gaseous, state, mars, is, nearly, or, perhaps, totally, geologically, dead, the, end, of, volcanic, activity, has, apparently, stopped, the, recycling, of, chemicals, and, minerals, between, the, surface, and, interior, of, the, planet, evidence, suggests, that, the, planet, was, once, significantly, more, habitable, than, it, is, today, but, whether, living, organisms, ever, existed, there, remains, unknown, the, viking, probes, of, the, mid, 1970s, carried, experiments, designed, to, detect, microorganisms, in, martian, soil, at, their, respective, landing, sites, and, had, positive, results, including, a, temporary, increase, in, co, 2, production, on, exposure, to, water, and, nutrients, this, sign, of, life, was, later, disputed, by, scientists, resulting, in, a, continuing, debate, with, nasa, scientist, gilbert, levin, asserting, that, viking, may, have, found, life, a, 2014, analysis, of, martian, meteorite, eeta79001, found, chlorate, perchlorate, and, nitrate, ions, in, sufficiently, high, concentrations, to, suggest, that, they, are, widespread, on, mars, uv, and, x, ray, radiation, would, turn, chlorate, and, perchlorate, ions, into, other, highly, reactive, oxychlorines, indicating, that, any, organic, molecules, would, have, to, be, buried, under, the, surface, to, survive, small, quantities, of, methane, and, formaldehyde, detected, by, mars, orbiters, are, both, claimed, to, be, possible, evidence, for, life, as, these, chemical, compounds, would, quickly, break, down, in, the, martian, atmosphere, alternatively, these, compounds, may, instead, be, replenished, by, volcanic, or, other, geological, means, such, as, serpentinite, impact, glass, formed, by, the, impact, of, meteors, which, on, earth, can, preserve, signs, of, life, has, also, been, found, on, the, surface, of, the, impact, craters, on, mars, likewise, the, glass, in, impact, craters, on, mars, could, have, preserved, signs, of, life, if, life, existed, at, the, site, the, cheyava, falls, rock, discovered, on, mars, in, june, 2024, has, been, designated, by, nasa, as, a, potential, biosignature, and, was, core, sampled, by, the, perseverance, rover, for, possible, return, to, earth, and, further, examination, although, highly, intriguing, no, definitive, final, determination, on, a, biological, or, abiotic, origin, of, this, rock, can, be, made, with, the, data, currently, available, several, plans, for, a, human, mission, to, mars, have, been, proposed, throughout, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, but, none, have, come, to, fruition, the, nasa, authorization, act, of, 2017, directed, nasa, to, study, the, feasibility, of, a, crewed, mars, mission, in, the, early, 2030s, the, resulting, report, eventually, concluded, that, this, would, be, unfeasible, in, addition, in, 2021, china, was, planning, to, send, a, crewed, mars, mission, in, 2033, privately, held, companies, such, as, spacex, have, also, proposed, plans, to, send, humans, to, mars, with, the, eventual, goal, to, settle, on, the, planet, as, of, 2024, spacex, has, proceeded, with, the, development, of, the, starship, launch, vehicle, with, the, goal, of, mars, colonization, in, plans, shared, with, the, company, in, april, 2024, elon, musk, envisions, the, beginning, of, a, mars, colony, within, the, next, twenty, years, this, enabled, by, the, planned, mass, manufacturing, of, starship, and, initially, sustained, by, resupply, from, earth, and, in, situ, resource, utilization, on, mars, until, the, mars, colony, reaches, full, self, sustainability, any, future, human, mission, to, mars, will, likely, take, place, within, the, optimal, mars, launch, window, which, occurs, every, 26, months, the, moon, phobos, has, been, proposed, as, an, anchor, point, for, a, space, elevator, besides, national, space, agencies, and, space, companies, there, are, groups, such, as, the, mars, society, and, the, planetary, society, that, advocates, for, human, missions, to, mars, mars, is, named, after, the, roman, god, of, war, this, association, between, mars, and, war, dates, back, at, least, to, babylonian, astronomy, in, which, the, planet, was, named, for, the, god, nergal, deity, of, war, and, destruction, it, persisted, into, modern, times, as, exemplified, by, gustav, holst, s, orchestral, suite, the, planets, whose, famous, first, movement, labels, mars, the, bringer, of, war, the, planet, s, symbol, a, circle, with, a, spear, pointing, out, to, the, upper, right, is, also, used, as, a, symbol, for, the, male, gender, the, symbol, dates, from, at, least, the, 11th, century, though, a, possible, predecessor, has, been, found, in, the, greek, oxyrhynchus, papyri, the, idea, that, mars, was, populated, by, intelligent, martians, became, widespread, in, the, late, 19th, century, schiaparelli, s, canali, observations, combined, with, percival, lowell, s, books, on, the, subject, put, forward, the, standard, notion, of, a, planet, that, was, a, drying, cooling, dying, world, with, ancient, civilizations, constructing, irrigation, works, many, other, observations, and, proclamations, by, notable, personalities, added, to, what, has, been, termed, mars, fever, high, resolution, mapping, of, the, surface, of, mars, revealed, no, artifacts, of, habitation, but, pseudoscientific, speculation, about, intelligent, life, on, mars, still, continues, reminiscent, of, the, canali, observations, these, speculations, are, based, on, small, scale, features, perceived, in, the, spacecraft, images, such, as, pyramids, and, the, face, on, mars, in, his, book, cosmos, planetary, astronomer, carl, sagan, wrote, mars, has, become, a, kind, of, mythic, arena, onto, which, we, have, projected, our, earthly, hopes, and, fears, the, depiction, of, mars, in, fiction, has, been, stimulated, by, its, dramatic, red, color, and, by, nineteenth, century, scientific, speculations, that, its, surface, conditions, might, support, not, just, life, but, intelligent, life, this, gave, way, to, many, science, fiction, stories, involving, these, concepts, such, as, h, g, wells, s, the, war, of, the, worlds, in, which, martians, seek, to, escape, their, dying, planet, by, invading, earth, ray, bradbury, s, the, martian, chronicles, in, which, human, explorers, accidentally, destroy, a, martian, civilization, as, well, as, edgar, rice, burroughs, s, series, barsoom, c, s, lewis, s, novel, out, of, the, silent, planet, 1938, and, a, number, of, robert, a, heinlein, stories, before, the, mid, sixties, since, then, depictions, of, martians, have, also, extended, to, animation, a, comic, figure, of, an, intelligent, martian, marvin, the, martian, appeared, in, haredevil, hare, 1948, as, a, character, in, the, looney, tunes, animated, cartoons, of, warner, brothers, and, has, continued, as, part, of, popular, culture, to, the, present, after, the, mariner, and, viking, spacecraft, had, returned, pictures, of, mars, as, a, lifeless, and, canal, less, world, these, ideas, about, mars, were, abandoned, for, many, science, fiction, authors, the, new, discoveries, initially, seemed, like, a, constraint, but, eventually, the, post, viking, knowledge, of, mars, became, itself, a, source, of, inspiration, for, works, like, kim, stanley, robinson, s, mars, trilogy, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow, may, be, read, as, within, or, part, of
