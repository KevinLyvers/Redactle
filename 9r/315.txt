a, covalent, bond, is, a, chemical, bond, that, involves, the, sharing, of, electrons, to, form, electron, pairs, between, atoms, these, electron, pairs, are, known, as, shared, pairs, or, bonding, pairs, the, stable, balance, of, attractive, and, repulsive, forces, between, atoms, when, they, share, electrons, is, known, as, covalent, bonding, for, many, molecules, the, sharing, of, electrons, allows, each, atom, to, attain, the, equivalent, of, a, full, valence, shell, corresponding, to, a, stable, electronic, configuration, in, organic, chemistry, covalent, bonding, is, much, more, common, than, ionic, bonding, covalent, bonding, also, includes, many, kinds, of, interactions, including, bonding, bonding, metal, to, metal, bonding, agostic, interactions, bent, bonds, three, center, two, electron, bonds, and, three, center, four, electron, bonds, the, term, covalent, bond, dates, from, 1939, the, prefix, co, means, jointly, associated, in, action, partnered, to, a, lesser, degree, etc, thus, a, co, valent, bond, in, essence, means, that, the, atoms, share, valence, such, as, is, discussed, in, valence, bond, theory, in, the, molecule, h, 2, the, hydrogen, atoms, share, the, two, electrons, via, covalent, bonding, covalency, is, greatest, between, atoms, of, similar, electronegativities, thus, covalent, bonding, does, not, necessarily, require, that, the, two, atoms, be, of, the, same, elements, only, that, they, be, of, comparable, electronegativity, covalent, bonding, that, entails, the, sharing, of, electrons, over, more, than, two, atoms, is, said, to, be, delocalized, the, term, covalence, in, regard, to, bonding, was, first, used, in, 1919, by, irving, langmuir, in, a, journal, of, the, american, chemical, society, article, entitled, the, arrangement, of, electrons, in, atoms, and, molecules, langmuir, wrote, that, we, shall, denote, by, the, term, covalence, the, number, of, pairs, of, electrons, that, a, given, atom, shares, with, its, neighbors, the, idea, of, covalent, bonding, can, be, traced, several, years, before, 1919, to, gilbert, n, lewis, who, in, 1916, described, the, sharing, of, electron, pairs, between, atoms, and, in, 1926, he, also, coined, the, term, photon, for, the, smallest, unit, of, radiant, energy, he, introduced, the, lewis, notation, or, electron, dot, notation, or, lewis, dot, structure, in, which, valence, electrons, those, in, the, outer, shell, are, represented, as, dots, around, the, atomic, symbols, pairs, of, electrons, located, between, atoms, represent, covalent, bonds, multiple, pairs, represent, multiple, bonds, such, as, double, bonds, and, triple, bonds, an, alternative, form, of, representation, not, shown, here, has, bond, forming, electron, pairs, represented, as, solid, lines, lewis, proposed, that, an, atom, forms, enough, covalent, bonds, to, form, a, full, or, closed, outer, electron, shell, in, the, diagram, of, methane, shown, here, the, carbon, atom, has, a, valence, of, four, and, is, therefore, surrounded, by, eight, electrons, the, octet, rule, four, from, the, carbon, itself, and, four, from, the, hydrogens, bonded, to, it, each, hydrogen, has, a, valence, of, one, and, is, surrounded, by, two, electrons, a, duet, rule, its, own, one, electron, plus, one, from, the, carbon, the, numbers, of, electrons, correspond, to, full, shells, in, the, quantum, theory, of, the, atom, the, outer, shell, of, a, carbon, atom, is, the, n, 2, shell, which, can, hold, eight, electrons, whereas, the, outer, and, only, shell, of, a, hydrogen, atom, is, the, n, 1, shell, which, can, hold, only, two, while, the, idea, of, shared, electron, pairs, provides, an, effective, qualitative, picture, of, covalent, bonding, quantum, mechanics, is, needed, to, understand, the, nature, of, these, bonds, and, predict, the, structures, and, properties, of, simple, molecules, walter, heitler, and, fritz, london, are, credited, with, the, first, successful, quantum, mechanical, explanation, of, a, chemical, bond, molecular, hydrogen, in, 1927, their, work, was, based, on, the, valence, bond, model, which, assumes, that, a, chemical, bond, is, formed, when, there, is, good, overlap, between, the, atomic, orbitals, of, participating, atoms, atomic, orbitals, except, for, s, orbitals, have, specific, directional, properties, leading, to, different, types, of, covalent, bonds, sigma, bonds, are, the, strongest, covalent, bonds, and, are, due, to, head, on, overlapping, of, orbitals, on, two, different, atoms, a, single, bond, is, usually, a, bond, pi, bonds, are, weaker, and, are, due, to, lateral, overlap, between, p, or, d, orbitals, a, double, bond, between, two, given, atoms, consists, of, one, and, one, bond, and, a, triple, bond, is, one, and, two, bonds, covalent, bonds, are, also, affected, by, the, electronegativity, of, the, connected, atoms, which, determines, the, chemical, polarity, of, the, bond, two, atoms, with, equal, electronegativity, will, make, nonpolar, covalent, bonds, such, as, h, h, an, unequal, relationship, creates, a, polar, covalent, bond, such, as, with, h, cl, however, polarity, also, requires, geometric, asymmetry, or, else, dipoles, may, cancel, out, resulting, in, a, non, polar, molecule, there, are, several, types, of, structures, for, covalent, substances, including, individual, molecules, molecular, structures, macromolecular, structures, and, giant, covalent, structures, individual, molecules, have, strong, bonds, that, hold, the, atoms, together, but, generally, there, are, negligible, forces, of, attraction, between, molecules, such, covalent, substances, are, usually, gases, for, example, hcl, so, 2, co, 2, and, ch, 4, in, molecular, structures, there, are, weak, forces, of, attraction, such, covalent, substances, are, low, boiling, temperature, liquids, such, as, ethanol, and, low, melting, temperature, solids, such, as, iodine, and, solid, co, 2, macromolecular, structures, have, large, numbers, of, atoms, linked, by, covalent, bonds, in, chains, including, synthetic, polymers, such, as, polyethylene, and, nylon, and, biopolymers, such, as, proteins, and, starch, network, covalent, structures, or, giant, covalent, structures, contain, large, numbers, of, atoms, linked, in, sheets, such, as, graphite, or, 3, dimensional, structures, such, as, diamond, and, quartz, these, substances, have, high, melting, and, boiling, points, are, frequently, brittle, and, tend, to, have, high, electrical, resistivity, elements, that, have, high, electronegativity, and, the, ability, to, form, three, or, four, electron, pair, bonds, often, form, such, large, macromolecular, structures, bonds, with, one, or, three, electrons, can, be, found, in, radical, species, which, have, an, odd, number, of, electrons, the, simplest, example, of, a, 1, electron, bond, is, found, in, the, dihydrogen, cation, h, 2, one, electron, bonds, often, have, about, half, the, bond, energy, of, a, 2, electron, bond, and, are, therefore, called, half, bonds, however, there, are, exceptions, in, the, case, of, dilithium, the, bond, is, actually, stronger, for, the, 1, electron, li, 2, than, for, the, 2, electron, li, 2, this, exception, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, hybridization, and, inner, shell, effects, the, simplest, example, of, three, electron, bonding, can, be, found, in, the, helium, dimer, cation, he, 2, it, is, considered, a, half, bond, because, it, consists, of, only, one, shared, electron, rather, than, two, in, molecular, orbital, terms, the, third, electron, is, in, an, anti, bonding, orbital, which, cancels, out, half, of, the, bond, formed, by, the, other, two, electrons, another, example, of, a, molecule, containing, a, 3, electron, bond, in, addition, to, two, 2, electron, bonds, is, nitric, oxide, no, the, oxygen, molecule, o, 2, can, also, be, regarded, as, having, two, 3, electron, bonds, and, one, 2, electron, bond, which, accounts, for, its, paramagnetism, and, its, formal, bond, order, of, 2, chlorine, dioxide, and, its, heavier, analogues, bromine, dioxide, and, iodine, dioxide, also, contain, three, electron, bonds, molecules, with, odd, electron, bonds, are, usually, highly, reactive, these, types, of, bond, are, only, stable, between, atoms, with, similar, electronegativities, there, are, situations, whereby, a, single, lewis, structure, is, insufficient, to, explain, the, electron, configuration, in, a, molecule, and, its, resulting, experimentally, determined, properties, hence, a, superposition, of, structures, is, needed, the, same, two, atoms, in, such, molecules, can, be, bonded, differently, in, different, lewis, structures, a, single, bond, in, one, a, double, bond, in, another, or, even, none, at, all, resulting, in, a, non, integer, bond, order, the, nitrate, ion, is, one, such, example, with, three, equivalent, structures, the, bond, between, the, nitrogen, and, each, oxygen, is, a, double, bond, in, one, structure, and, a, single, bond, in, the, other, two, so, that, the, average, bond, order, for, each, n, o, interaction, is, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 3, in, organic, chemistry, when, a, molecule, with, a, planar, ring, obeys, h, ckel, s, rule, where, the, number, of, electrons, fit, the, formula, 4, n, 2, where, n, is, an, integer, it, attains, extra, stability, and, symmetry, in, benzene, the, prototypical, aromatic, compound, there, are, 6, bonding, electrons, n, 1, 4, n, 2, 6, these, occupy, three, delocalized, molecular, orbitals, molecular, orbital, theory, or, form, conjugate, bonds, in, two, resonance, structures, that, linearly, combine, valence, bond, theory, creating, a, regular, hexagon, exhibiting, a, greater, stabilization, than, the, hypothetical, 1, 3, 5, cyclohexatriene, in, the, case, of, heterocyclic, aromatics, and, substituted, benzenes, the, electronegativity, differences, between, different, parts, of, the, ring, may, dominate, the, chemical, behavior, of, aromatic, ring, bonds, which, otherwise, are, equivalent, certain, molecules, such, as, xenon, difluoride, and, sulfur, hexafluoride, have, higher, co, ordination, numbers, than, would, be, possible, due, to, strictly, covalent, bonding, according, to, the, octet, rule, this, is, explained, by, the, three, center, four, electron, bond, 3c, 4e, model, which, interprets, the, molecular, wavefunction, in, terms, of, non, bonding, highest, occupied, molecular, orbitals, in, molecular, orbital, theory, and, resonance, of, sigma, bonds, in, valence, bond, theory, in, three, center, two, electron, bonds, 3c, 2e, three, atoms, share, two, electrons, in, bonding, this, type, of, bonding, occurs, in, boron, hydrides, such, as, diborane, b, 2, h, 6, which, are, often, described, as, electron, deficient, because, there, are, not, enough, valence, electrons, to, form, localized, 2, centre, 2, electron, bonds, joining, all, the, atoms, however, the, more, modern, description, using, 3c, 2e, bonds, does, provide, enough, bonding, orbitals, to, connect, all, the, atoms, so, that, the, molecules, can, instead, be, classified, as, electron, precise, each, such, bond, 2, per, molecule, in, diborane, contains, a, pair, of, electrons, which, connect, the, boron, atoms, to, each, other, in, a, banana, shape, with, a, proton, the, nucleus, of, a, hydrogen, atom, in, the, middle, of, the, bond, sharing, electrons, with, both, boron, atoms, in, certain, cluster, compounds, so, called, four, center, two, electron, bonds, also, have, been, postulated, after, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, two, basic, theories, were, proposed, to, provide, a, quantum, description, of, chemical, bonding, valence, bond, vb, theory, and, molecular, orbital, mo, theory, a, more, recent, quantum, description, is, given, in, terms, of, atomic, contributions, to, the, electronic, density, of, states, the, two, theories, represent, two, ways, to, build, up, the, electron, configuration, of, the, molecule, for, valence, bond, theory, the, atomic, hybrid, orbitals, are, filled, with, electrons, first, to, produce, a, fully, bonded, valence, configuration, followed, by, performing, a, linear, combination, of, contributing, structures, resonance, if, there, are, several, of, them, in, contrast, for, molecular, orbital, theory, a, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, is, performed, first, followed, by, filling, of, the, resulting, molecular, orbitals, with, electrons, the, two, approaches, are, regarded, as, complementary, and, each, provides, its, own, insights, into, the, problem, of, chemical, bonding, as, valence, bond, theory, builds, the, molecular, wavefunction, out, of, localized, bonds, it, is, more, suited, for, the, calculation, of, bond, energies, and, the, understanding, of, reaction, mechanisms, as, molecular, orbital, theory, builds, the, molecular, wavefunction, out, of, delocalized, orbitals, it, is, more, suited, for, the, calculation, of, ionization, energies, and, the, understanding, of, spectral, absorption, bands, at, the, qualitative, level, both, theories, contain, incorrect, predictions, simple, heitler, london, valence, bond, theory, correctly, predicts, the, dissociation, of, homonuclear, diatomic, molecules, into, separate, atoms, while, simple, hartree, fock, molecular, orbital, theory, incorrectly, predicts, dissociation, into, a, mixture, of, atoms, and, ions, on, the, other, hand, simple, molecular, orbital, theory, correctly, predicts, h, ckel, s, rule, of, aromaticity, while, simple, valence, bond, theory, incorrectly, predicts, that, cyclobutadiene, has, larger, resonance, energy, than, benzene, although, the, wavefunctions, generated, by, both, theories, at, the, qualitative, level, do, not, agree, and, do, not, match, the, stabilization, energy, by, experiment, they, can, be, corrected, by, configuration, interaction, this, is, done, by, combining, the, valence, bond, covalent, function, with, the, functions, describing, all, possible, ionic, structures, or, by, combining, the, molecular, orbital, ground, state, function, with, the, functions, describing, all, possible, excited, states, using, unoccupied, orbitals, it, can, then, be, seen, that, the, simple, molecular, orbital, approach, overestimates, the, weight, of, the, ionic, structures, while, the, simple, valence, bond, approach, neglects, them, this, can, also, be, described, as, saying, that, the, simple, molecular, orbital, approach, neglects, electron, correlation, while, the, simple, valence, bond, approach, overestimates, it, modern, calculations, in, quantum, chemistry, usually, start, from, but, ultimately, go, far, beyond, a, molecular, orbital, rather, than, a, valence, bond, approach, not, because, of, any, intrinsic, superiority, in, the, former, but, rather, because, the, mo, approach, is, more, readily, adapted, to, numerical, computations, molecular, orbitals, are, orthogonal, which, significantly, increases, the, feasibility, and, speed, of, computer, calculations, compared, to, nonorthogonal, valence, bond, orbitals, in, coop, cohp, and, bcoop, evaluation, of, bond, covalency, is, dependent, on, the, basis, set, to, overcome, this, issue, an, alternative, formulation, of, the, bond, covalency, can, be, provided, in, this, way, the, mass, center, c, m, n, l, m, l, m, s, displaystyle, cm, n, l, m, l, m, s, of, an, atomic, orbital, n, l, m, l, m, s, displaystyle, n, l, m, l, m, s, rangle, with,

that, it, encompasses, all, of, the, relevant, bands, participating, in, the, bond, if, the, range, to, select, is, unclear, it, can, be, identified, in, practice, by, examining, the, molecular, orbitals, that, describe, the, electron, density, along, with, the, considered, bond, the, relative, position, c, n, a, l, a, n, b, l, b, displaystyle, c, n, mathrm, a, l, mathrm, a, n, mathrm, b, l,

b, l, mathrm, b, rangle, levels, of, atom, b, is, given, as, where, the, contributions, of, the, magnetic, and, spin, quantum, numbers, are, summed, according, to, this, definition, the, relative, position, of, the, a, levels, with, respect, to, the, b, levels, is, where, for, simplicity, we, may, omit, the, dependence, from, the, principal, quantum, number, n, displaystyle, n, in, the, notation, referring, to, c, n, a, l, a, n, b, l, b, displaystyle, c, n, mathrm, a, l, mathrm, a, n, mathrm, b, l, mathrm, b, in, this, formalism, the, greater, the, value, of, c, a, b, displaystyle,

covalent, binding, is, believed, to, occur, in, some, nuclear, systems, with, the, difference, that, the, shared, fermions, are, quarks, rather, than, electrons, high, energy, proton, proton, scattering, cross, section, indicates, that, quark, interchange, of, either, u, or, d, quarks, is, the, dominant, process, of, the, nuclear, force, at, short, distance, in, particular, it, dominates, over, the, yukawa, interaction, where, a, meson, is, exchanged, therefore, covalent, binding, by, quark, interchange, is, expected, to, be, the, dominating, mechanism, of, nuclear, binding, at, small, distance, when, the, bound, hadrons, have, covalence, quarks, in, common
