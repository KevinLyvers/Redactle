the, internal, energy, of, a, thermodynamic, system, is, the, energy, contained, within, it, measured, as, the, quantity, of, energy, necessary, to, bring, the, system, from, its, standard, internal, state, to, its, present, internal, state, of, interest, accounting, for, the, gains, and, losses, of, energy, due, to, changes, in, its, internal, state, including, such, quantities, as, magnetization, it, excludes, the, kinetic, energy, of, motion, of, the, system, as, a, whole, and, the, potential, energy, of, position, of, the, system, as, a, whole, with, respect, to, its, surroundings, and, external, force, fields, it, includes, the, thermal, energy, i, e, the, constituent, particles, kinetic, energies, of, motion, relative, to, the, motion, of, the, system, as, a, whole, the, internal, energy, of, an, isolated, system, cannot, change, as, expressed, in, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, a, foundation, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, the, internal, energy, cannot, be, measured, absolutely, thermodynamics, concerns, changes, in, the, internal, energy, not, its, absolute, value, the, processes, that, change, the, internal, energy, are, transfers, into, or, out, of, the, system, of, matter, or, of, energy, as, heat, or, by, thermodynamic, work, these, processes, are, measured, by, changes, in, the, system, s, properties, such, as, temperature, entropy, volume, electric, polarization, and, molar, constitution, the, internal, energy, depends, only, on, the, internal, state, of, the, system, and, not, on, the, particular, choice, from, many, possible, processes, by, which, energy, may, pass, into, or, out, of, the, system, it, is, a, state, variable, a, thermodynamic, potential, and, an, extensive, property, thermodynamics, defines, internal, energy, macroscopically, for, the, body, as, a, whole, in, statistical, mechanics, the, internal, energy, of, a, body, can, be, analyzed, microscopically, in, terms, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, microscopic, motion, of, the, system, s, particles, from, translations, rotations, and, vibrations, and, of, the, potential, energies, associated, with, microscopic, forces, including, chemical, bonds, the, unit, of, energy, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, the, joule, j, the, internal, energy, relative, to, the, mass, with, unit, j, kg, is, the, specific, internal, energy, the, corresponding, quantity, relative, to, the, amount, of, substance, with, unit, j, mol, is, the, molar, internal, energy, the, internal, energy, of, a, system, depends, on, its, entropy, s, its, volume, v, and, its, number, of, massive, particles, u, s, v, n, j, it, expresses, the, thermodynamics, of, a, system, in, the, energy, representation, as, a, function, of, state, its, arguments, are, exclusively, extensive, variables, of, state, alongside, the, internal, energy, the, other, cardinal, function, of, state, of, a, thermodynamic, system, is, its, entropy, as, a, function, s, u, v, n, j, of, the, same, list, of, extensive, variables, of, state, except, that, the, entropy, s, is, replaced, in, the, list, by, the, internal, energy, u, it, expresses, the, entropy, representation, each, cardinal, function, is, a, monotonic, function, of, each, of, its, natural, or, canonical, variables, each, provides, its, characteristic, or, fundamental, equation, for, example, u, u, s, v, n, j, that, by, itself, contains, all, thermodynamic, information, about, the, system, the, fundamental, equations, for, the, two, cardinal, functions, can, in, principle, be, interconverted, by, solving, for, example, u, u, s, v, n, j, for, s, to, get, s, s, u, v, n, j, in, contrast, legendre, transformations, are, necessary, to, derive, fundamental, equations, for, other, thermodynamic, potentials, and, massieu, functions, the, entropy, as, a, function, only, of, extensive, state, variables, is, the, one, and, only, cardinal, function, of, state, for, the, generation, of, massieu, functions, it, is, not, itself, customarily, designated, a, massieu, function, though, rationally, it, might, be, thought, of, as, such, corresponding, to, the, term, thermodynamic, potential, which, includes, the, internal, energy, for, real, and, practical, systems, explicit, expressions, of, the, fundamental, equations, are, almost, always, unavailable, but, the, functional, relations, exist, in, principle, formal, in, principle, manipulations, of, them, are, valuable, for, the, understanding, of, thermodynamics, the, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, u, of, a, given, state, of, the, system, is, determined, relative, to, that, of, a, standard, state, of, the, system, by, adding, up, the, macroscopic, transfers, of, energy, that, accompany, a, change, of, state, from, the, reference, state, to, the, given, state, where, u, displaystyle, delta, u, denotes, the, difference, between, the, internal, energy, of, the, given, state, and, that, of, the, reference, state, and, the, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, are, the, various, energies, transferred, to, the, system, in, the, steps, from, the, reference, state, to, the, given, state, it, is, the, energy, needed, to, create, the, given, state, of, the, system, from, the, reference, state, from, a, non, relativistic, microscopic, point, of, view, it, may, be, divided, into, microscopic, potential, energy, u, micro, pot, displaystyle, u, text, micro, pot, and, microscopic, kinetic, energy, u, micro, kin, displaystyle, u, text, micro, kin, components, the, microscopic, kinetic, energy, of, a, system, arises, as, the, sum, of, the, motions, of, all, the, system, s, particles, with, respect, to, the, center, of, mass, frame, whether, it, be, the, motion, of, atoms, molecules, atomic, nuclei, electrons, or, other, particles, the, microscopic, potential, energy, algebraic, summative, components, are, those, of, the, chemical, and, nuclear, particle, bonds, and, the, physical, force, fields, within, the, system, such, as, due, to, internal, induced, electric, or, magnetic, dipole, moment, as, well, as, the, energy, of, deformation, of, solids, stress, strain, usually, the, split, into, microscopic, kinetic, and, potential, energies, is, outside, the, scope, of, macroscopic, thermodynamics, internal, energy, does, not, include, the, energy, due, to, motion, or, location, of, a, system, as, a, whole, that, is, to, say, it, excludes, any, kinetic, or, potential, energy, the, body, may, have, because, of, its, motion, or, location, in, external, gravitational, electrostatic, or, electromagnetic, fields, it, does, however, include, the, contribution, of, such, a, field, to, the, energy, due, to, the, coupling, of, the, internal, degrees, of, freedom, of, the, object, with, the, field, in, such, a, case, the, field, is, included, in, the, thermodynamic, description, of, the, object, in, the, form, of, an, additional, external, parameter, for, practical, considerations, in, thermodynamics, or, engineering, it, is, rarely, necessary, convenient, nor, even, possible, to, consider, all, energies, belonging, to, the, total, intrinsic, energy, of, a, sample, system, such, as, the, energy, given, by, the, equivalence, of, mass, typically, descriptions, only, include, components, relevant, to, the, system, under, study, indeed, in, most, systems, under, consideration, especially, through, thermodynamics, it, is, impossible, to, calculate, the, total, internal, energy, therefore, a, convenient, null, reference, point, may, be, chosen, for, the, internal, energy, the, internal, energy, is, an, extensive, property, it, depends, on, the, size, of, the, system, or, on, the, amount, of, substance, it, contains, at, any, temperature, greater, than, absolute, zero, microscopic, potential, energy, and, kinetic, energy, are, constantly, converted, into, one, another, but, the, sum, remains, constant, in, an, isolated, system, cf, table, in, the, classical, picture, of, thermodynamics, kinetic, energy, vanishes, at, zero, temperature, and, the, internal, energy, is, purely, potential, energy, however, quantum, mechanics, has, demonstrated, that, even, at, zero, temperature, particles, maintain, a, residual, energy, of, motion, the, zero, point, energy, a, system, at, absolute, zero, is, merely, in, its, quantum, mechanical, ground, state, the, lowest, energy, state, available, at, absolute, zero, a, system, of, given, composition, has, attained, its, minimum, attainable, entropy, the, microscopic, kinetic, energy, portion, of, the, internal, energy, gives, rise, to, the, temperature, of, the, system, statistical, mechanics, relates, the, pseudo, random, kinetic, energy, of, individual, particles, to, the, mean, kinetic, energy, of, the, entire, ensemble, of, particles, comprising, a, system, furthermore, it, relates, the, mean, microscopic, kinetic, energy, to, the, macroscopically, observed, empirical, property, that, is, expressed, as, temperature, of, the, system, while, temperature, is, an, intensive, measure, this, energy, expresses, the, concept, as, an, extensive, property, of, the, system, often, referred, to, as, the, thermal, energy, the, scaling, property, between, temperature, and, thermal, energy, is, the, entropy, change, of, the, system, statistical, mechanics, considers, any, system, to, be, statistically, distributed, across, an, ensemble, of, n, displaystyle, n, microstates, in, a, system, that, is, in, thermodynamic, contact, equilibrium, with, a, heat, reservoir, each, microstate, has, an, energy, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, and, is, associated, with, a, probability, p, i, displaystyle, p, i, the, internal, energy, is, the, mean, value, of, the, system, s, total, energy, i, e, the, sum, of, all, microstate, energies, each, weighted, by, its, probability, of, occurrence, this, is, the, statistical, expression, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, thermodynamics, is, chiefly, concerned, with, the, changes, in, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, delta, u, for, a, closed, system, with, matter, transfer, excluded, the, changes, in, internal, energy, are, due, to, heat, transfer, q, displaystyle, q, and, due, to, thermodynamic, work, w, displaystyle, w, done, by, the, system, on, its, surroundings, accordingly, the, internal, energy, change, u, displaystyle, delta, u, for, a, process, may, be, written, u, q, w, closed, system, no, transfer, of, matter, displaystyle, delta, u, q, w, quad, text, closed, system, no, transfer, of, matter, when, a, closed, system, receives, energy, as, heat, this, energy, increases, the, internal, energy, it, is, distributed, between, microscopic, kinetic, and, microscopic, potential, energies, in, general, thermodynamics, does, not, trace, this, distribution, in, an, ideal, gas, all, of, the, extra, energy, results, in, a, temperature, increase, as, it, is, stored, solely, as, microscopic, kinetic, energy, such, heating, is, said, to, be, sensible, a, second, kind, of, mechanism, of, change, in, the, internal, energy, of, a, closed, system, changed, is, in, its, doing, of, work, on, its, surroundings, such, work, may, be, simply, mechanical, as, when, the, system, expands, to, drive, a, piston, or, for, example, when, the, system, changes, its, electric, polarization, so, as, to, drive, a, change, in, the, electric, field, in, the, surroundings, if, the, system, is, not, closed, the, third, mechanism, that, can, increase, the, internal, energy, is, transfer, of, matter, into, the, system, this, increase, u, m, a, t, t, e, r, displaystyle, delta, u, mathrm, matter, cannot, be, split, into, heat, and, work, components, if, the, system, is, so, set, up, physically, that, heat, transfer, and, work, that, it, does, are, by, pathways, separate, from, and, independent, of, matter, transfer, then, the, transfers, of, energy, add, to, change, the, internal, energy, u, q, w, u, matter, matter, transfer, pathway, separate, from, heat, and, work, transfer, pathways, displaystyle, delta, u, q, w, delta, u, text, matter, quad, text, matter, transfer, pathway, separate, from, heat, and, work, transfer, pathways, if, a, system, undergoes, certain, phase, transformations, while, being, heated, such, as, melting, and, vaporization, it, may, be, observed, that, the, temperature, of, the, system, does, not, change, until, the, entire, sample, has, completed, the, transformation, the, energy, introduced, into, the, system, while, the, temperature, does, not, change, is, called, latent, energy, or, latent, heat, in, contrast, to, sensible, heat, which, is, associated, with, temperature, change, thermodynamics, often, uses, the, concept, of, the, ideal, gas, for, teaching, purposes, and, as, an, approximation, for, working, systems, the, ideal, gas, consists, of, particles, considered, as, point, objects, that, interact, only, by, elastic, collisions, and, fill, a, volume, such, that, their, mean, free, path, between, collisions, is, much, larger, than, their, diameter, such, systems, approximate, monatomic, gases, such, as, helium, and, other, noble, gases, for, an, ideal, gas, the, kinetic, energy, consists, only, of, the, translational, energy, of, the, individual, atoms, monatomic, particles, do, not, possess, rotational, or, vibrational, degrees, of, freedom, and, are, not, electronically, excited, to, higher, energies, except, at, very, high, temperatures, therefore, the, internal, energy, of, an, ideal, gas, depends, solely, on, its, temperature, and, the, number, of, gas, particles, u, u, n, t, displaystyle, u, u, n, t, it, is, not, dependent, on, other, thermodynamic, quantities, such, as, pressure, or, density, the, internal, energy, of, an, ideal, gas, is, proportional, to, its, amount, of, substance, number, of, moles, n, displaystyle, n, and, to, its, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, where, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, is, the, isochoric, at, constant, volume, molar, heat, capacity, of, the, gas, c, v, displaystyle, c, v, is, constant, for, an, ideal, gas, the, internal, energy, of, any, gas,

differentials, of, each, term, though, only, the, internal, energy, is, an, exact, differential, 33, for, a, closed, system, with, transfers, only, as, heat, and, work, the, change, in, the, internal, energy, is, expressing, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, it, may, be, expressed, in, terms, of, other, thermodynamic, parameters, each, term, is, composed, of, an, intensive, variable, a, generalized, force, and, its, conjugate, infinitesimal, extensive, variable, a, generalized, displacement, for, example, the, mechanical, work, done, by, the, system, may, be, related, to, the, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, and, volume, change, d, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, v, the, pressure, is, the, intensive, generalized, force, while, the, volume, change, is, the, extensive, generalized,
