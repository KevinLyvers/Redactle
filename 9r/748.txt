cumulus, clouds, are, clouds, that, have, flat, bases, and, are, often, described, as, puffy, cotton, like, or, fluffy, in, appearance, their, name, derives, from, the, latin, cumulus, meaning, heap, or, pile, cumulus, clouds, are, low, level, clouds, generally, less, than, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, in, altitude, unless, they, are, the, more, vertical, cumulus, congestus, form, cumulus, clouds, may, appear, by, themselves, in, lines, or, in, clusters, cumulus, clouds, are, often, precursors, of, other, types, of, clouds, such, as, cumulonimbus, when, influenced, by, weather, factors, such, as, instability, humidity, and, temperature, gradient, normally, cumulus, clouds, produce, little, or, no, precipitation, but, they, can, grow, into, the, precipitation, bearing, cumulus, congestus, or, cumulonimbus, clouds, cumulus, clouds, can, be, formed, from, water, vapour, supercooled, water, droplets, or, ice, crystals, depending, upon, the, ambient, temperature, they, come, in, many, distinct, subforms, and, generally, cool, the, earth, by, reflecting, the, incoming, solar, radiation, cumulus, clouds, are, part, of, the, larger, category, of, free, convective, cumuliform, clouds, which, include, cumulonimbus, clouds, the, latter, genus, type, is, sometimes, categorized, separately, as, cumulonimbiform, due, to, its, more, complex, structure, that, often, includes, a, cirriform, or, anvil, top, there, are, also, cumuliform, clouds, of, limited, convection, that, comprise, stratocumulus, low, tage, altocumulus, middle, tage, and, cirrocumulus, high, tage, these, last, three, genus, types, are, sometimes, classified, separately, as, stratocumuliform, cumulus, clouds, form, via, atmospheric, convection, as, air, warmed, by, the, surface, begins, to, rise, as, the, air, rises, the, temperature, drops, following, the, lapse, rate, causing, the, relative, humidity, rh, to, rise, if, convection, reaches, a, certain, level, the, rh, reaches, one, hundred, percent, and, the, wet, adiabatic, phase, begins, at, this, point, a, positive, feedback, ensues, since, the, rh, is, above, 100, water, vapor, condenses, releasing, latent, heat, warming, the, air, and, spurring, further, convection, in, this, phase, water, vapor, condenses, on, various, nuclei, present, in, the, air, forming, the, cumulus, cloud, this, creates, the, characteristic, flat, bottomed, puffy, shape, associated, with, cumulus, clouds, the, height, of, the, cloud, from, its, bottom, to, its, top, depends, on, the, temperature, profile, of, the, atmosphere, and, of, the, presence, of, any, inversions, during, the, convection, surrounding, air, is, entrained, mixed, with, the, thermal, and, the, total, mass, of, the, ascending, air, increases, rain, forms, in, a, cumulus, cloud, via, a, process, involving, two, non, discrete, stages, the, first, stage, occurs, after, the, droplets, coalesce, onto, the, various, nuclei, langmuir, writes, that, surface, tension, in, the, water, droplets, provides, a, slightly, higher, pressure, on, the, droplet, raising, the, vapor, pressure, by, a, small, amount, the, increased, pressure, results, in, those, droplets, evaporating, and, the, resulting, water, vapor, condensing, on, the, larger, droplets, due, to, the, extremely, small, size, of, the, evaporating, water, droplets, this, process, becomes, largely, meaningless, after, the, larger, droplets, have, grown, to, around, 20, to, 30, micrometres, and, the, second, stage, takes, over, in, the, accretion, phase, the, raindrop, begins, to, fall, and, other, droplets, collide, and, combine, with, it, to, increase, the, size, of, the, raindrop, langmuir, was, able, to, develop, a, formula, which, predicted, that, the, droplet, radius, would, grow, unboundedly, within, a, discrete, time, period, the, liquid, water, density, within, a, cumulus, cloud, has, been, found, to, change, with, height, above, the, cloud, base, rather, than, being, approximately, constant, throughout, the, cloud, in, one, particular, study, the, concentration, was, found, to, be, zero, at, cloud, base, as, altitude, increased, the, concentration, rapidly, increased, to, the, maximum, concentration, near, the, middle, of, the, cloud, the, maximum, concentration, was, found, to, be, anything, up, to, 1, 25, grams, of, water, per, kilogram, of, air, the, concentration, slowly, dropped, off, as, altitude, increased, to, the, height, of, the, top, of, the, cloud, where, it, immediately, dropped, to, zero, again, cumulus, clouds, can, form, in, lines, stretching, over, 480, kilometres, 300, mi, long, called, cloud, streets, these, cloud, streets, cover, vast, areas, and, may, be, broken, or, continuous, they, form, when, wind, shear, causes, horizontal, circulation, in, the, atmosphere, producing, the, long, tubular, cloud, streets, they, generally, form, during, high, pressure, systems, such, as, after, a, cold, front, the, height, at, which, the, cloud, forms, depends, on, the, amount, of, moisture, in, the, thermal, that, forms, the, cloud, humid, air, will, generally, result, in, a, lower, cloud, base, in, temperate, areas, the, base, of, the, cumulus, clouds, is, usually, below, 550, metres, 1, 800, ft, above, ground, level, but, it, can, range, up, to, 2, 400, metres, 7, 900, ft, in, altitude, in, arid, and, mountainous, areas, the, cloud, base, can, be, in, excess, of, 6, 100, metres, 20, 000, ft, cumulus, clouds, can, be, composed, of, ice, crystals, water, droplets, supercooled, water, droplets, or, a, mixture, of, them, the, water, droplets, form, when, water, vapor, condenses, on, the, nuclei, and, they, may, then, coalesce, into, larger, and, larger, droplets, one, study, found, that, in, temperate, regions, the, cloud, bases, studied, ranged, from, 500, to, 1, 500, metres, 1, 600, to, 4, 900, ft, above, ground, level, these, clouds, were, normally, above, 25, c, 77, f, and, the, concentration, of, droplets, ranged, from, 23, to, 1, 300, droplets, per, cubic, centimetre, 380, to, 21, 300, per, cubic, inch, this, data, was, taken, from, growing, isolated, cumulus, clouds, that, were, not, precipitating, the, droplets, were, very, small, ranging, down, to, around, 5, micrometres, in, diameter, although, smaller, droplets, may, have, been, present, the, measurements, were, not, sensitive, enough, to, detect, them, the, smallest, droplets, were, found, in, the, lower, portions, of, the, clouds, with, the, percentage, of, large, droplets, around, 20, to, 30, micrometres, rising, dramatically, in, the, upper, regions, of, the, cloud, the, droplet, size, distribution, was, slightly, bimodal, in, nature, with, peaks, at, the, small, and, large, droplet, sizes, and, a, slight, trough, in, the, intermediate, size, range, the, skew, was, roughly, neutral, furthermore, large, droplet, size, is, roughly, inversely, proportional, to, the, droplet, concentration, per, unit, volume, of, air, in, places, cumulus, clouds, can, have, holes, where, there, are, no, water, droplets, these, can, occur, when, winds, tear, the, cloud, and, incorporate, the, environmental, air, or, when, strong, downdrafts, evaporate, the, water, cumulus, clouds, come, in, four, distinct, species, cumulus, humilis, mediocris, congestus, and, fractus, these, species, may, be, arranged, into, the, variety, cumulus, radiatus, and, may, be, accompanied, by, up, to, seven, supplementary, features, cumulus, pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and, tuba, the, species, cumulus, fractus, is, ragged, in, appearance, and, can, form, in, clear, air, as, a, precursor, to, cumulus, humilis, and, larger, cumulus, species, types, or, it, can, form, in, precipitation, as, the, supplementary, feature, pannus, also, called, scud, which, can, also, include, stratus, fractus, of, bad, weather, cumulus, humilis, clouds, look, like, puffy, flattened, shapes, cumulus, mediocris, clouds, look, similar, except, that, they, have, some, vertical, development, cumulus, congestus, clouds, have, a, cauliflower, like, structure, and, tower, high, into, the, atmosphere, hence, their, alternate, name, towering, cumulus, the, variety, cumulus, radiatus, forms, in, radial, bands, called, cloud, streets, and, can, comprise, any, of, the, four, species, of, cumulus, cumulus, supplementary, features, are, most, commonly, seen, with, the, species, congestus, cumulus, virga, clouds, are, cumulus, clouds, producing, virga, precipitation, that, evaporates, while, aloft, and, cumulus, praecipitatio, produce, precipitation, that, reaches, the, earth, s, surface, cumulus, pannus, comprise, shredded, clouds, that, normally, appear, beneath, the, parent, cumulus, cloud, during, precipitation, cumulus, arcus, clouds, have, a, gust, front, and, cumulus, tuba, clouds, have, funnel, clouds, or, tornadoes, cumulus, pileus, clouds, refer, to, cumulus, clouds, that, have, grown, so, rapidly, as, to, force, the, formation, of, pileus, over, the, top, of, the, cloud, cumulus, velum, clouds, have, an, ice, crystal, veil, over, the, growing, top, of, the, cloud, there, are, also, cumulus, cataractagenitus, which, are, formed, by, waterfalls, cumulus, humilis, clouds, usually, indicate, fair, weather, cumulus, mediocris, clouds, are, similar, except, that, they, have, some, vertical, development, which, implies, that, they, can, grow, into, cumulus, congestus, or, even, cumulonimbus, clouds, which, can, produce, heavy, rain, lightning, severe, winds, hail, and, even, tornadoes, cumulus, congestus, clouds, which, appear, as, towers, will, often, grow, into, cumulonimbus, storm, clouds, they, can, produce, precipitation, glider, pilots, often, pay, close, attention, to, cumulus, clouds, as, they, can, be, indicators, of, rising, air, drafts, or, thermals, underneath, that, can, suck, the, plane, high, into, the, sky, a, phenomenon, known, as, cloud, suck, due, to, reflectivity, clouds, cool, the, earth, by, around, 12, c, 22, f, an, effect, largely, caused, by, stratocumulus, clouds, however, at, the, same, time, they, heat, the, earth, by, around, 7, c, 13, f, by, reflecting, emitted, radiation, an, effect, largely, caused, by, cirrus, clouds, this, averages, out, to, a, net, loss, of, 5, c, 9, 0, f, cumulus, clouds, on, the, other, hand, have, a, variable, effect, on, heating, the, earth, s, surface, the, more, vertical, cumulus, congestus, species, and, cumulonimbus, genus, of, clouds, grow, high, into, the, atmosphere, carrying, moisture, with, them, which, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, cirrus, clouds, the, researchers, speculated, that, this, might, even, produce, a, positive, feedback, where, the, increasing, upper, atmospheric, moisture, further, warms, the, earth, resulting, in, an, increasing, number, of, cumulus, congestus, clouds, carrying, more, moisture, into, the, upper, atmosphere, cumulus, clouds, are, a, genus, of, free, convective, low, level, cloud, along, with, the, related, limited, convective, cloud, stratocumulus, these, clouds, form, from, ground, level, to, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, at, all, latitudes, stratus, clouds, are, also, low, level, in, the, middle, level, are, the, alto, clouds, which, consist, of, the, limited, convective, stratocumuliform, cloud, altocumulus, and, the, stratiform, cloud, altostratus, mid, level, clouds, form, from, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, to, 7, 000, metres, 23, 000, ft, in, polar, areas, 7, 000, metres, 23, 000, ft, in, temperate, areas, and, 7, 600, metres, 24, 900, ft, in, tropical, areas, the, high, level, cloud, cirrocumulus, is, a, stratocumuliform, cloud, of, limited, convection, the, other, clouds, in, this, level, are, cirrus, and, cirrostratus, high, clouds, form, 3, 000, to, 7, 600, metres, 9, 800, to, 24, 900, ft, in, high, latitudes, 5, 000, to, 12, 000, metres, 16, 000, to, 39, 000, ft, in, temperate, latitudes, and, 6, 100, to, 18, 000, metres, 20, 000, to, 59, 100, ft, in, low, tropical, latitudes, cumulonimbus, clouds, like, cumulus, congestus, extend, vertically, rather, than, remaining, confined, to, one, level, cirrocumulus, clouds, form, in, patches, and, cannot, cast, shadows, they, commonly, appear, in, regular, rippling, patterns, or, in, rows, of, clouds, with, clear, areas, between, cirrocumulus, are, like, other, members, of, the, cumuliform, and, stratocumuliform, categories, formed, via, convective, processes, significant, growth, of, these, patches, indicates, high, altitude, instability, and, can, signal, the, approach, of, poorer, weather, the, ice, crystals, in, the, bottoms, of, cirrocumulus, clouds, tend, to, be, in, the, form, of, hexagonal, cylinders, they, are, not, solid, but, instead, tend, to, have, stepped, funnels, coming, in, from, the, ends, towards, the, top, of, the, cloud, these, crystals, have, a, tendency, to, clump, together, these, clouds, do, not, last, long, and, they, tend, to, change, into, cirrus, because, as, the, water, vapor, continues, to, deposit, on, the, ice, crystals, they, eventually, begin, to, fall, destroying, the, upward, convection, the, cloud, then, dissipates, into, cirrus, cirrocumulus, clouds, come, in, four, species, which, are, common, to, all, three, genus, types, that, have, limited, convective, or, stratocumuliform, characteristics, stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and, floccus, they, are, iridescent, when, the, constituent, supercooled, water, droplets, are, all, about, the, same, size, altocumulus, clouds, are, a, mid, level, cloud, that, forms, from, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, high, to, 4, 000, metres, 13, 000, ft, in, polar, areas, 7, 000, metres, 23, 000, ft, in, temperate, areas, and, 7, 600, metres, 24, 900, ft, in, tropical, areas, they, can, have, precipitation, and, are, commonly, composed, of, a, mixture, of, ice, crystals, supercooled, water, droplets, and, water, droplets, in, temperate, latitudes, however, the, liquid, water, concentration, was, almost, always, significantly, greater, than, the, concentration, of, ice, crystals, and, the, maximum, concentration, of, liquid, water, tended, to, be, at, the, top, of, the, cloud, while, the, ice, concentrated, itself, at, the, bottom, the, ice, crystals, in, the, base, of, the, altocumulus, clouds, and, in, the, virga, were, found, to, be, dendrites, or, conglomerations, of, dendrites, while, needles, and, plates, resided, more, towards, the, top, altocumulus, clouds, can, form, via, convection, or, via, the, forced, uplift, caused, by, a, warm, front, a, stratocumulus, cloud, is, another, type, of, stratocumuliform, cloud, like, cumulus, clouds, they, form, at, low, levels, and, via, convection, however, unlike, cumulus, clouds, their, growth, is, almost, completely, retarded, by, a, strong, inversion, as, a, result, they, flatten, out, like, stratus, clouds, giving, them, a, layered, appearance, these, clouds, are, extremely, common, covering, on, average, around, twenty, three, percent, of, the, earth, s, oceans, and, twelve, percent, of, the, earth, s, continents, they, are, less, common, in, tropical, areas, and, commonly, form, after, cold, fronts, additionally, stratocumulus, clouds, reflect, a, large, amount, of, the, incoming, sunlight, producing, a, net, cooling, effect, stratocumulus, clouds, can, produce, drizzle, which, stabilizes, the, cloud, by, warming, it, and, reducing, turbulent, mixing, cumulonimbus, clouds, are, the, final, form, of, growing, cumulus, clouds, they, form, when, cumulus, congestus, clouds, develop, a, strong, updraft, that, propels, their, tops, higher, and, higher, into, the, atmosphere, until, they, reach, the, tropopause, at, 18, 000, metres, 59, 000, ft, in, altitude, cumulonimbus, clouds, commonly, called, thunderheads, can, produce, high, winds, torrential, rain, lightning, gust, fronts, waterspouts, funnel, clouds, and, tornadoes, they, commonly, have, anvil, clouds, a, short, lived, horseshoe, cloud, may, occur, when, a, horseshoe, vortex, deforms, a, cumulus, cloud, some, cumuliform, and, stratocumuliform, clouds, have, been, discovered, on, most, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, on, mars, the, viking, orbiter, detected, cirrocumulus, and, stratocumulus, clouds, forming, via, convection, primarily, near, the, polar, icecaps, the, galileo, space, probe, detected, massive, cumulonimbus, clouds, near, the, great, red, spot, on, jupiter, cumuliform, clouds, have, also, been, detected, on, saturn, in, 2008, the, cassini, spacecraft, determined, that, cumulus, clouds, near, saturn, s, south, pole, were, part, of, a, cyclone, over, 4, 000, kilometres, 2, 500, mi, in, diameter, the, keck, observatory, detected, whitish, cumulus, clouds, on, uranus, like, uranus, neptune, has, methane, cumulus, clouds, venus, however, does, not, appear, to, have, cumulus, clouds
