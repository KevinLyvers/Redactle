climatology, from, greek, klima, slope, and, logia, or, climate, science, is, the, scientific, study, of, earth, s, climate, typically, defined, as, weather, conditions, averaged, over, a, period, of, at, least, 30, years, climate, concerns, the, atmospheric, condition, during, an, extended, to, indefinite, period, of, time, weather, is, the, condition, of, the, atmosphere, during, a, relative, brief, period, of, time, the, main, topics, of, research, are, the, study, of, climate, variability, mechanisms, of, climate, changes, and, modern, climate, change, this, topic, of, study, is, regarded, as, part, of, the, atmospheric, sciences, and, a, subdivision, of, physical, geography, which, is, one, of, the, earth, sciences, climatology, includes, some, aspects, of, oceanography, and, biogeochemistry, the, main, methods, employed, by, climatologists, are, the, analysis, of, observations, and, modelling, of, the, physical, processes, that, determine, climate, short, term, weather, forecasting, can, be, interpreted, in, terms, of, knowledge, of, longer, term, phenomena, of, climate, for, instance, climatic, cycles, such, as, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, the, madden, julian, oscillation, mjo, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, nao, the, arctic, oscillation, ao, the, pacific, decadal, oscillation, pdo, and, the, interdecadal, pacific, oscillation, ipo, climate, models, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, from, studying, the, dynamics, of, the, weather, and, climate, system, to, predictions, of, future, climate, the, greeks, began, the, formal, study, of, climate, in, fact, the, word, climate, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, klima, meaning, slope, referring, to, the, slope, or, inclination, of, the, earth, s, axis, arguably, the, most, influential, classic, text, concerning, climate, was, on, airs, water, and, places, written, by, hippocrates, about, 400, bce, this, work, commented, on, the, effect, of, climate, on, human, health, and, cultural, differences, between, asia, and, europe, this, idea, that, climate, controls, which, populations, excel, depending, on, their, climate, or, climatic, determinism, remained, influential, throughout, history, chinese, scientist, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, inferred, that, climates, naturally, shifted, over, an, enormous, span, of, time, after, observing, petrified, bamboos, found, underground, near, yanzhou, modern, yan, an, shaanxi, province, a, dry, climate, area, unsuitable, at, that, time, for, the, growth, of, bamboo, the, invention, of, thermometers, and, barometers, during, the, scientific, revolution, allowed, for, systematic, recordkeeping, that, began, as, early, as, 1640, 1642, in, england, early, climate, researchers, include, edmund, halley, who, published, a, map, of, the, trade, winds, in, 1686, after, a, voyage, to, the, southern, hemisphere, benjamin, franklin, 1706, 1790, first, mapped, the, course, of, the, gulf, stream, for, use, in, sending, mail, from, north, america, to, europe, francis, galton, 1822, 1911, invented, the, term, anticyclone, helmut, landsberg, 1906, 1985, fostered, the, use, of, statistical, analysis, in, climatology, during, the, early, 20th, century, climatology, mostly, emphasized, the, description, of, regional, climates, this, descriptive, climatology, was, mainly, an, applied, science, giving, farmers, and, other, interested, people, statistics, about, what, the, normal, weather, was, and, how, great, chances, were, of, extreme, events, to, do, this, climatologists, had, to, define, a, climate, normal, or, an, average, of, weather, and, weather, extremes, over, a, period, of, typically, 30, years, while, scientists, knew, of, past, climate, change, such, as, the, ice, ages, the, concept, of, climate, as, changing, only, very, gradually, was, useful, for, descriptive, climatology, this, started, to, change, during, the, decades, that, followed, and, while, the, history, of, climate, change, science, started, earlier, climate, change, only, became, one, of, the, main, topics, of, study, for, climatologists, during, the, 1970s, and, afterward, various, subtopics, of, climatology, study, different, aspects, of, climate, there, are, different, categorizations, of, the, sub, topics, of, climatology, the, american, meteorological, society, for, instance, identifies, descriptive, climatology, scientific, climatology, and, applied, climatology, as, the, three, subcategories, of, climatology, a, categorization, based, on, the, complexity, and, the, purpose, of, the, research, applied, climatologists, apply, their, expertise, to, different, industries, such, as, manufacturing, and, agriculture, paleoclimatology, is, the, attempt, to, reconstruct, and, understand, past, climates, by, examining, records, such, as, ice, cores, and, tree, rings, dendroclimatology, paleotempestology, uses, these, same, records, to, help, determine, hurricane, frequency, over, millennia, historical, climatology, is, the, study, of, climate, as, related, to, human, history, and, is, thus, concerned, mainly, with, the, last, few, thousand, years, boundary, layer, climatology, concerns, exchanges, in, water, energy, and, momentum, near, surfaces, further, identified, subtopics, are, physical, climatology, dynamic, climatology, tornado, climatology, regional, climatology, bioclimatology, and, synoptic, climatology, the, study, of, the, hydrological, cycle, over, long, time, scales, is, sometimes, termed, hydroclimatology, in, particular, when, studying, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, water, cycle, the, study, of, contemporary, climates, incorporates, meteorological, data, accumulated, over, many, years, such, as, records, of, rainfall, temperature, and, atmospheric, composition, knowledge, of, the, atmosphere, and, its, dynamics, is, also, embodied, in, models, either, statistical, or, mathematical, which, help, by, integrating, different, observations, and, testing, how, well, they, match, modeling, is, used, for, understanding, past, present, and, potential, future, climates, climate, research, is, made, difficult, by, the, large, scale, long, time, periods, and, complex, processes, which, govern, climate, climate, is, governed, by, physical, principles, which, can, be, expressed, as, differential, equations, these, equations, are, coupled, and, nonlinear, so, that, approximate, solutions, are, obtained, by, using, numerical, methods, to, create, global, climate, models, climate, is, sometimes, modeled, as, a, stochastic, process, but, this, is, generally, accepted, as, an, approximation, to, processes, that, are, otherwise, too, complicated, to, analyze, the, collection, of, a, long, record, of, climate, variables, is, essential, for, the, study, of, climate, climatology, deals, with, the, aggregate, data, that, meteorologists, have, recorded, scientists, use, both, direct, and, indirect, observations, of, the, climate, from, earth, observing, satellites, and, scientific, instrumentation, such, as, a, global, network, of, thermometers, to, prehistoric, ice, extracted, from, glaciers, as, measuring, technology, changes, over, time, records, of, data, often, cannot, be, compared, directly, as, cities, are, generally, warmer, than, the, areas, surrounding, urbanization, has, made, it, necessary, to, constantly, correct, data, for, this, urban, heat, island, effect, climate, models, use, quantitative, methods, to, simulate, the, interactions, of, the, atmosphere, oceans, land, surface, and, ice, they, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, from, study, of, the, dynamics, of, the, weather, and, climate, system, to, projections, of, future, climate, all, climate, models, balance, or, very, nearly, balance, incoming, energy, as, short, wave, including, visible, electromagnetic, radiation, to, the, earth, with, outgoing, energy, as, long, wave, infrared, electromagnetic, radiation, from, the, earth, any, unbalance, results, in, a, change, of, the, average, temperature, of, the, earth, most, climate, models, include, the, radiative, effects, of, greenhouse, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, these, models, predict, a, trend, of, increase, of, surface, temperatures, as, well, as, a, more, rapid, increase, of, temperature, at, higher, latitudes, models, can, range, from, relatively, simple, to, complex, additionally, they, are, available, with, different, resolutions, ranging, from, 100, km, to, 1, km, high, resolutions, in, global, climate, models, are, computational, very, demanding, and, only, few, global, datasets, exists, examples, are, icon, or, mechanistically, downscaled, data, such, as, chelsa, climatologies, at, high, resolution, for, the, earth, s, land, surface, areas, topics, that, climatologists, study, comprise, three, main, categories, climate, variability, mechanisms, of, climatic, change, and, modern, changes, of, climate, various, factors, affect, the, average, state, of, the, atmosphere, at, a, particular, location, for, instance, midlatitudes, will, have, a, pronounced, seasonal, cycle, of, temperature, whereas, tropical, regions, show, little, variation, of, temperature, over, a, year, another, major, variable, of, climate, is, continentality, the, distance, to, major, water, bodies, such, as, oceans, oceans, act, as, a, moderating, factor, so, that, land, close, to, it, has, typically, less, difference, of, temperature, between, winter, and, summer, than, areas, further, from, it, the, atmosphere, interacts, with, other, parts, of, the, climate, system, with, winds, generating, ocean, currents, that, transport, heat, around, the, globe, classification, is, an, important, method, of, simplifying, complicated, processes, different, climate, classifications, have, been, developed, over, the, centuries, with, the, first, ones, in, ancient, greece, how, climates, are, classified, depends, on, what, the, application, is, a, wind, energy, producer, will, require, different, information, wind, in, a, classification, than, someone, more, interested, in, agriculture, for, whom, precipitation, and, temperature, are, more, important, the, most, widely, used, classification, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, was, developed, during, the, late, nineteenth, century, and, is, based, on, vegetation, it, uses, monthly, data, concerning, temperature, and, precipitation, there, are, different, types, of, variability, recurring, patterns, of, temperature, or, other, climate, variables, they, are, quantified, with, different, indices, much, in, the, way, the, dow, jones, industrial, average, which, is, based, on, the, stock, prices, of, 30, companies, is, used, to, represent, the, fluctuations, of, stock, prices, in, general, climate, indices, are, used, to, represent, the, essential, elements, of, climate, climate, indices, are, generally, devised, with, the, twin, objectives, of, simplicity, and, completeness, and, each, index, typically, represents, the, status, and, timing, of, the, climate, factor, it, represents, by, their, very, nature, indices, are, simple, and, combine, many, details, into, a, generalized, overall, description, of, the, atmosphere, or, ocean, which, can, be, used, to, characterize, the, factors, which, effect, the, global, climate, system, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, is, a, coupled, ocean, atmosphere, phenomenon, in, the, pacific, ocean, responsible, for, much, of, the, global, variability, of, temperature, and, has, a, cycle, between, two, and, seven, years, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, is, a, mode, of, variability, that, is, mainly, contained, to, the, lower, atmosphere, the, troposphere, the, layer, of, atmosphere, above, the, stratosphere, is, also, capable, of, creating, its, own, variability, most, importantly, the, madden, julian, oscillation, mjo, which, has, a, cycle, of, approximately, 30, to, 60, days, the, interdecadal, pacific, oscillation, can, create, changes, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, lower, atmosphere, on, decadal, time, scales, climate, change, occurs, when, changes, of, earth, s, climate, system, result, in, new, weather, patterns, that, remain, for, an, extended, period, of, time, this, duration, of, time, can, be, as, brief, as, a, few, decades, to, as, long, as, millions, of, years, the, climate, system, receives, nearly, all, of, its, energy, from, the, sun, the, climate, system, also, gives, off, energy, to, outer, space, the, balance, of, incoming, and, outgoing, energy, and, the, passage, of, the, energy, through, the, climate, system, determines, earth, s, energy, budget, when, the, incoming, energy, is, greater, than, the, outgoing, energy, earth, s, energy, budget, is, positive, and, the, climate, system, is, warming, if, more, energy, goes, out, the, energy, budget, is, negative, and, earth, experiences, cooling, climate, change, also, influences, the, average, sea, level, modern, climate, change, is, caused, largely, by, the, human, emissions, of, greenhouse, gas, from, the, burning, of, fossil, fuel, which, increases, global, mean, surface, temperatures, increasing, temperature, is, only, one, aspect, of, modern, climate, change, which, also, includes, observed, changes, of, precipitation, storm, tracks, and, cloudiness, warmer, temperatures, are, causing, further, changes, of, the, climate, system, such, as, the, widespread, melt, of, glaciers, sea, level, rise, and, shifts, of, flora, and, fauna, in, contrast, to, meteorology, which, emphasises, short, term, weather, systems, lasting, no, more, than, a, few, weeks, climatology, studies, the, frequency, and, trends, of, those, systems, it, studies, the, periodicity, of, weather, events, over, years, to, millennia, as, well, as, changes, of, long, term, average, weather, patterns, in, relation, to, atmospheric, conditions, climatologists, study, both, the, nature, of, climates, local, regional, or, global, and, the, natural, or, human, induced, factors, that, cause, climates, to, change, climatology, considers, the, past, and, can, help, predict, future, climate, change, phenomena, of, climatological, interest, include, the, atmospheric, boundary, layer, circulation, patterns, heat, transfer, radiative, convective, and, latent, interactions, between, the, atmosphere, and, the, oceans, and, land, surface, particularly, vegetation, land, use, and, topography, and, the, chemical, and, physical, composition, of, the, atmosphere, a, relative, difficult, method, of, forecast, the, analog, technique, requires, remembering, a, previous, weather, event, which, is, expected, to, be, mimicked, by, an, upcoming, event, what, makes, it, a, difficult, technique, is, that, there, is, rarely, a, perfect, analog, for, an, event, of, the, future, some, refer, to, this, type, of, forecasting, as, pattern, recognition, which, remains, a, useful, method, of, estimating, rainfall, over, data, voids, such, as, oceans, using, knowledge, of, how, satellite, imagery, relates, to, precipitation, rates, over, land, as, well, as, the, forecasting, of, precipitation, amounts, and, distribution, of, the, future, a, variation, of, this, theme, used, for, medium, range, forecasting, is, known, as, teleconnections, when, systems, in, other, locations, are, used, to, help, determine, the, location, of, a, system, within, the, regime, surrounding, one, method, of, using, teleconnections, are, by, using, climate, indices, such, as, enso, related, phenomena
