lactic, acid, is, an, organic, acid, it, has, the, molecular, formula, c, 3, h, 6, o, 3, it, is, white, in, the, solid, state, and, it, is, miscible, with, water, when, in, the, dissolved, state, it, forms, a, colorless, solution, production, includes, both, artificial, synthesis, as, well, as, natural, sources, lactic, acid, is, an, alpha, hydroxy, acid, aha, due, to, the, presence, of, a, hydroxyl, group, adjacent, to, the, carboxyl, group, it, is, used, as, a, synthetic, intermediate, in, many, organic, synthesis, industries, and, in, various, biochemical, industries, the, conjugate, base, of, lactic, acid, is, called, lactate, or, the, lactate, anion, the, name, of, the, derived, acyl, group, is, lactoyl, in, solution, it, can, ionize, by, a, loss, of, a, proton, to, produce, the, lactate, ion, ch, 3, ch, oh, co, 2, compared, to, acetic, acid, its, p, k, a, is, 1, unit, less, meaning, lactic, acid, is, ten, times, more, acidic, than, acetic, acid, this, higher, acidity, is, the, consequence, of, the, intramolecular, hydrogen, bonding, between, the, hydroxyl, and, the, carboxylate, group, lactic, acid, is, chiral, consisting, of, two, enantiomers, one, is, known, as, l, lactic, acid, s, lactic, acid, or, lactic, acid, and, the, other, its, mirror, image, is, d, lactic, acid, r, lactic, acid, or, lactic, acid, a, mixture, of, the, two, in, equal, amounts, is, called, dl, lactic, acid, or, racemic, lactic, acid, lactic, acid, is, hygroscopic, dl, lactic, acid, is, miscible, with, water, and, with, ethanol, above, its, melting, point, which, is, about, 16, to, 18, c, 61, to, 64, f, d, lactic, acid, and, l, lactic, acid, have, a, higher, melting, point, lactic, acid, produced, by, fermentation, of, milk, is, often, racemic, although, certain, species, of, bacteria, produce, solely, d, lactic, acid, on, the, other, hand, lactic, acid, produced, by, anaerobic, respiration, in, animal, muscles, has, the, l, enantiomer, and, is, sometimes, called, sarcolactic, acid, from, the, greek, sarx, meaning, flesh, in, animals, l, lactate, is, constantly, produced, from, pyruvate, via, the, enzyme, lactate, dehydrogenase, ldh, in, a, process, of, fermentation, during, normal, metabolism, and, exercise, it, does, not, increase, in, concentration, until, the, rate, of, lactate, production, exceeds, the, rate, of, lactate, removal, which, is, governed, by, a, number, of, factors, including, monocarboxylate, transporters, concentration, and, isoform, of, ldh, and, oxidative, capacity, of, tissues, the, concentration, of, blood, lactate, is, usually, 1, 2, mm, tooltip, millimolar, at, rest, but, can, rise, to, over, 20, mm, during, intense, exertion, and, as, high, as, 25, mm, afterward, in, addition, to, other, biological, roles, l, lactic, acid, is, the, primary, endogenous, agonist, of, hydroxycarboxylic, acid, receptor, 1, hca, 1, which, is, a, g, i, o, coupled, g, protein, coupled, receptor, gpcr, in, industry, lactic, acid, fermentation, is, performed, by, lactic, acid, bacteria, which, convert, simple, carbohydrates, such, as, glucose, sucrose, or, galactose, to, lactic, acid, these, bacteria, can, also, grow, in, the, mouth, the, acid, they, produce, is, responsible, for, the, tooth, decay, known, as, cavities, in, medicine, lactate, is, one, of, the, main, components, of, lactated, ringer, s, solution, and, hartmann, s, solution, these, intravenous, fluids, consist, of, sodium, and, potassium, cations, along, with, lactate, and, chloride, anions, in, solution, with, distilled, water, generally, in, concentrations, isotonic, with, human, blood, it, is, most, commonly, used, for, fluid, resuscitation, after, blood, loss, due, to, trauma, surgery, or, burns, lactic, acid, is, produced, in, human, tissues, when, the, demand, for, oxygen, is, limited, by, the, supply, this, occurs, during, tissue, ischemia, when, the, flow, of, blood, is, limited, as, in, sepsis, or, hemorrhagic, shock, it, may, also, occur, when, demand, for, oxygen, is, high, such, as, with, intense, exercise, lactic, acidosis, results, in, an, oxygen, debt, which, can, be, resolved, or, repaid, when, tissue, oxygenation, improves, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, was, the, first, person, to, isolate, lactic, acid, in, 1780, from, sour, milk, the, name, reflects, the, lact, combining, form, derived, from, the, latin, word, lac, meaning, milk, in, 1808, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, discovered, that, lactic, acid, actually, l, lactate, also, is, produced, in, muscles, during, exertion, its, structure, was, established, by, johannes, wislicenus, in, 1873, in, 1856, the, role, of, lactobacillus, in, the, synthesis, of, lactic, acid, was, discovered, by, louis, pasteur, this, pathway, was, used, commercially, by, the, german, pharmacy, boehringer, ingelheim, in, 1895, in, 2006, global, production, of, lactic, acid, reached, 275, 000, tonnes, with, an, average, annual, growth, of, 10, lactic, acid, is, produced, industrially, by, bacterial, fermentation, of, carbohydrates, or, by, chemical, synthesis, from, acetaldehyde, as, of, 2009, lactic, acid, was, produced, predominantly, 70, 90, by, fermentation, production, of, racemic, lactic, acid, consisting, of, a, 1, 1, mixture, of, d, and, l, stereoisomers, or, of, mixtures, with, up, to, 99, 9, l, lactic, acid, is, possible, by, microbial, fermentation, industrial, scale, production, of, d, lactic, acid, by, fermentation, is, possible, but, much, more, challenging, fermented, milk, products, are, obtained, industrially, by, fermentation, of, milk, or, whey, by, lactobacillus, bacteria, lactobacillus, acidophilus, lacticaseibacillus, casei, lactobacillus, casei, lactobacillus, delbrueckii, subsp, bulgaricus, lactobacillus, bulgaricus, lactobacillus, helveticus, lactococcus, lactis, bacillus, amyloliquefaciens, and, streptococcus, salivarius, subsp, thermophilus, streptococcus, thermophilus, as, a, starting, material, for, industrial, production, of, lactic, acid, almost, any, carbohydrate, source, containing, c, 5, pentose, sugar, and, c, 6, hexose, sugar, can, be, used, pure, sucrose, glucose, from, starch, raw, sugar, and, beet, juice, are, frequently, used, lactic, acid, producing, bacteria, can, be, divided, in, two, classes, homofermentative, bacteria, like, lactobacillus, casei, and, lactococcus, lactis, producing, two, moles, of, lactate, from, one, mole, of, glucose, and, heterofermentative, species, producing, one, mole, of, lactate, from, one, mole, of, glucose, as, well, as, carbon, dioxide, and, acetic, acid, ethanol, racemic, lactic, acid, is, synthesized, industrially, by, reacting, acetaldehyde, with, hydrogen, cyanide, and, hydrolysing, the, resultant, lactonitrile, when, hydrolysis, is, performed, by, hydrochloric, acid, ammonium, chloride, forms, as, a, by, product, the, japanese, company, musashino, is, one, of, the, last, big, manufacturers, of, lactic, acid, by, this, route, synthesis, of, both, racemic, and, enantiopure, lactic, acids, is, also, possible, from, other, starting, materials, vinyl, acetate, glycerol, etc, by, application, of, catalytic, procedures, l, lactic, acid, is, the, primary, endogenous, agonist, of, hydroxycarboxylic, acid, receptor, 1, hca, 1, a, g, i, o, coupled, g, protein, coupled, receptor, gpcr, during, power, exercises, such, as, sprinting, when, the, rate, of, demand, for, energy, is, high, glucose, is, broken, down, and, oxidized, to, pyruvate, and, lactate, is, then, produced, from, the, pyruvate, faster, than, the, body, can, process, it, causing, lactate, concentrations, to, rise, the, production, of, lactate, is, beneficial, for, nad, regeneration, pyruvate, is, reduced, to, lactate, while, nadh, is, oxidized, to, nad, which, is, used, up, in, oxidation, of, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, during, production, of, pyruvate, from, glucose, and, this, ensures, that, energy, production, is, maintained, and, exercise, can, continue, during, intense, exercise, the, respiratory, chain, cannot, keep, up, with, the, amount, of, hydrogen, ions, that, join, to, form, nadh, and, cannot, regenerate, nad, quickly, enough, so, pyruvate, is, converted, to, lactate, to, allow, energy, production, by, glycolysis, to, continue, the, resulting, lactate, can, be, used, in, two, ways, lactate, is, continually, formed, at, rest, and, during, all, exercise, intensities, lactate, serves, as, a, metabolic, fuel, being, produced, and, oxidatively, disposed, in, resting, and, exercising, muscle, and, other, tissues, some, sources, of, excess, lactate, production, are, metabolism, in, red, blood, cells, which, lack, mitochondria, that, perform, aerobic, respiration, and, limitations, in, the, rates, of, enzyme, activity, in, muscle, fibers, during, intense, exertion, lactic, acidosis, is, a, physiological, condition, characterized, by, accumulation, of, lactate, especially, l, lactate, with, formation, of, an, excessively, high, proton, concentration, and, correspondingly, low, ph, in, the, tissues, a, form, of, metabolic, acidosis, the, first, stage, in, metabolizing, glucose, is, glycolysis, the, conversion, of, glucose, to, pyruvate, and, h, when, sufficient, oxygen, is, present, for, aerobic, respiration, the, pyruvate, is, oxidized, to, co, 2, and, water, by, the, krebs, cycle, in, which, oxidative, phosphorylation, generates, atp, for, use, in, powering, the, cell, when, insufficient, oxygen, is, present, or, when, there, is, insufficient, capacity, for, pyruvate, oxidation, to, keep, up, with, rapid, pyruvate, production, during, intense, exertion, the, pyruvate, is, converted, to, lactate, by, lactate, dehydrogenase, a, process, that, absorbs, these, protons, the, combined, effect, is, the, production, of, lactate, from, glucose, glucose, 2, lactate, 2, h, when, viewed, in, isolation, releases, two, h, the, h, are, absorbed, in, the, production, of, atp, but, h, is, subsequently, released, during, hydrolysis, of, atp, once, the, production, and, use, of, atp, is, included, the, overall, reaction, is, the, resulting, increase, in, acidity, persists, until, the, excess, lactate, and, protons, are, converted, back, to, pyruvate, and, then, to, glucose, for, later, use, or, to, co, 2, and, water, for, the, production, of, atp, although, glucose, is, usually, assumed, to, be, the, main, energy, source, for, living, tissues, there, is, evidence, that, lactate, in, preference, to, glucose, is, preferentially, metabolized, by, neurons, in, the, brains, of, several, mammalian, species, that, include, mice, rats, and, humans, according, to, the, lactate, shuttle, hypothesis, glial, cells, are, responsible, for, transforming, glucose, into, lactate, and, for, providing, lactate, to, the, neurons, because, of, this, local, metabolic, activity, of, glial, cells, the, extracellular, fluid, immediately, surrounding, neurons, strongly, differs, in, composition, from, the, blood, or, cerebrospinal, fluid, being, much, richer, with, lactate, as, was, found, in, microdialysis, studies, some, evidence, suggests, that, lactate, is, important, at, early, stages, of, development, for, brain, metabolism, in, prenatal, and, early, postnatal, subjects, with, lactate, at, these, stages, having, higher, concentrations, in, body, liquids, and, being, utilized, by, the, brain, preferentially, over, glucose, it, was, also, hypothesized, that, lactate, may, exert, a, strong, action, over, gabaergic, networks, in, the, developing, brain, making, them, more, inhibitory, than, it, was, previously, assumed, acting, either, through, better, support, of, metabolites, or, alterations, in, base, intracellular, ph, levels, or, both, studies, of, brain, slices, of, mice, show, that, hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and, pyruvate, act, as, oxidative, energy, substrates, causing, an, increase, in, the, nad, p, h, oxidation, phase, that, glucose, was, insufficient, as, an, energy, carrier, during, intense, synaptic, activity, and, finally, that, lactate, can, be, an, efficient, energy, substrate, capable, of, sustaining, and, enhancing, brain, aerobic, energy, metabolism, in, vitro, the, study, provides, novel, data, on, biphasic, nad, p, h, fluorescence, transients, an, important, physiological, response, to, neural, activation, that, has, been, reproduced, in, many, studies, and, that, is, believed, to, originate, predominantly, from, activity, induced, concentration, changes, to, the, cellular, nadh, pools, lactate, can, also, serve, as, an, important, source, of, energy, for, other, organs, including, the, heart, and, liver, during, physical, activity, up, to, 60, of, the, heart, muscle, s, energy, turnover, rate, derives, from, lactate, oxidation, blood, tests, for, lactate, are, performed, to, determine, the, status, of, the, acid, base, homeostasis, in, the, body, blood, sampling, for, this, purpose, is, often, arterial, even, if, it, is, more, difficult, than, venipuncture, because, lactate, levels, differ, substantially, between, arterial, and, venous, and, the, arterial, level, is, more, representative, for, this, purpose, during, childbirth, lactate, levels, in, the, fetus, can, be, quantified, by, fetal, scalp, blood, testing, two, molecules, of, lactic, acid, can, be, dehydrated, to, the, lactone, lactide, in, the, presence, of, catalysts, lactide, polymerize, to, either, atactic, or, syndiotactic, polylactide, pla, which, are, biodegradable, polyesters, pla, is, an, example, of, a, plastic, that, is, not, derived, from, petrochemicals, lactic, acid, is, also, employed, in, pharmaceutical, technology, to, produce, water, soluble, lactates, from, otherwise, insoluble, active, ingredients, it, finds, further, use, in, topical, preparations, and, cosmetics, to, adjust, acidity, and, for, its, disinfectant, and, keratolytic, properties, lactic, acid, containing, bacteria, have, shown, promise, in, reducing, oxaluria, with, its, descaling, properties, on, calcium, compounds, lactic, acid, is, found, primarily, in, sour, milk, products, such, as, kumis, laban, yogurt, kefir, and, some, cottage, cheeses, the, casein, in, fermented, milk, is, coagulated, curdled, by, lactic, acid, lactic, acid, is, also, responsible, for, the, sour, flavor, of, sourdough, bread, in, lists, of, nutritional, information, lactic, acid, might, be, included, under, the, term, carbohydrate, or, carbohydrate, by, difference, because, this, often, includes, everything, other, than, water, protein, fat, ash, and, ethanol, if, this, is, the, case, then, the, calculated, food, energy, may, use, the, standard, 4, kilocalories, 17, kj, per, gram, that, is, often, used, for, all, carbohydrates, but, in, some, cases, lactic, acid, is, ignored, in, the, calculation, the, energy, density, of, lactic, acid, is, 362, kilocalories, 1, 510, kj, per, 100, g, some, beers, sour, beer, purposely, contain, lactic, acid, one, such, type, being, belgian, lambics, most, commonly, this, is, produced, naturally, by, various, strains, of, bacteria, these, bacteria, ferment, sugars, into, acids, unlike, the, yeast, that, ferment, sugar, into, ethanol, after, cooling, the, wort, yeast, and, bacteria, are, allowed, to, fall, into, the, open, fermenters, brewers, of, more, common, beer, styles, would, ensure, that, no, such, bacteria, are, allowed, to, enter, the, fermenter, other, sour, styles, of, beer, include, berliner, weisse, flanders, red, and, american, wild, ale, in, winemaking, a, bacterial, process, natural, or, controlled, is, often, used, to, convert, the, naturally, present, malic, acid, to, lactic, acid, to, reduce, the, sharpness, and, for, other, flavor, related, reasons, this, malolactic, fermentation, is, undertaken, by, lactic, acid, bacteria, while, not, normally, found, in, significant, quantities, in, fruit, lactic, acid, is, the, primary, organic, acid, in, akebia, fruit, making, up, 2, 12, of, the, juice, as, a, food, additive, it, is, approved, for, use, in, the, eu, united, states, and, australia, and, new, zealand, it, is, listed, by, its, ins, number, 270, or, as, e, number, e270, lactic, acid, is, used, as, a, food, preservative, curing, agent, and, flavoring, agent, it, is, an, ingredient, in, processed, foods, and, is, used, as, a, decontaminant, during, meat, processing, lactic, acid, is, produced, commercially, by, fermentation, of, carbohydrates, such, as, glucose, sucrose, or, lactose, or, by, chemical, synthesis, carbohydrate, sources, include, corn, beets, and, cane, sugar, lactic, acid, has, historically, been, used, to, assist, with, the, erasure, of, inks, from, official, papers, to, be, modified, during, forgery, lactic, acid, is, used, in, some, liquid, cleaners, as, a, descaling, agent, for, removing, hard, water, deposits, such, as, calcium, carbonate
