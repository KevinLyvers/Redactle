in, geology, and, mineralogy, a, mineral, or, mineral, species, is, broadly, speaking, a, solid, substance, with, a, fairly, well, defined, chemical, composition, and, a, specific, crystal, structure, that, occurs, naturally, in, pure, form, the, geological, definition, of, mineral, normally, excludes, compounds, that, occur, only, in, living, organisms, however, some, minerals, are, often, biogenic, such, as, calcite, or, organic, compounds, in, the, sense, of, chemistry, such, as, mellite, moreover, living, organisms, often, synthesize, inorganic, minerals, such, as, hydroxylapatite, that, also, occur, in, rocks, the, concept, of, mineral, is, distinct, from, rock, which, is, any, bulk, solid, geologic, material, that, is, relatively, homogeneous, at, a, large, enough, scale, a, rock, may, consist, of, one, type, of, mineral, or, may, be, an, aggregate, of, two, or, more, different, types, of, minerals, spacially, segregated, into, distinct, phases, some, natural, solid, substances, without, a, definite, crystalline, structure, such, as, opal, or, obsidian, are, more, properly, called, mineraloids, if, a, chemical, compound, occurs, naturally, with, different, crystal, structures, each, structure, is, considered, a, different, mineral, species, thus, for, example, quartz, and, stishovite, are, two, different, minerals, consisting, of, the, same, compound, silicon, dioxide, the, international, mineralogical, association, ima, is, the, generally, recognized, standard, body, for, the, definition, and, nomenclature, of, mineral, species, as, of, july, 2024, the, ima, recognizes, 6, 062, official, mineral, species, the, chemical, composition, of, a, named, mineral, species, may, vary, somewhat, due, to, the, inclusion, of, small, amounts, of, impurities, specific, varieties, of, a, species, sometimes, have, conventional, or, official, names, of, their, own, for, example, amethyst, is, a, purple, variety, of, the, mineral, species, quartz, some, mineral, species, can, have, variable, proportions, of, two, or, more, chemical, elements, that, occupy, equivalent, positions, in, the, mineral, s, structure, for, example, the, formula, of, mackinawite, is, given, as, fe, ni, 9, s, 8, meaning, fe, x, ni, 9, x, s, 8, where, x, is, a, variable, number, between, 0, and, 9, sometimes, a, mineral, with, variable, composition, is, split, into, separate, species, more, or, less, arbitrarily, forming, a, mineral, group, that, is, the, case, of, the, silicates, ca, x, mg, y, fe, 2, x, y, sio, 4, the, olivine, group, besides, the, essential, chemical, composition, and, crystal, structure, the, description, of, a, mineral, species, usually, includes, its, common, physical, properties, such, as, habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting, specific, gravity, magnetism, fluorescence, radioactivity, as, well, as, its, taste, or, smell, and, its, reaction, to, acid, minerals, are, classified, by, key, chemical, constituents, the, two, dominant, systems, are, the, dana, classification, and, the, strunz, classification, silicate, minerals, comprise, approximately, 90, of, the, earth, s, crust, other, important, mineral, groups, include, the, native, elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and, phosphates, the, international, mineralogical, association, has, established, the, following, requirements, for, a, substance, to, be, considered, a, distinct, mineral, the, details, of, these, rules, are, somewhat, controversial, for, instance, there, have, been, several, recent, proposals, to, classify, amorphous, substances, as, minerals, but, they, have, not, been, accepted, by, the, ima, the, ima, is, also, reluctant, to, accept, minerals, that, occur, naturally, only, in, the, form, of, nanoparticles, a, few, hundred, atoms, across, but, has, not, defined, a, minimum, crystal, size, some, authors, require, the, material, to, be, a, stable, or, metastable, solid, at, room, temperature, 25, c, however, the, ima, only, requires, that, the, substance, be, stable, enough, for, its, structure, and, composition, to, be, well, determined, for, example, it, has, recently, recognized, meridianiite, a, naturally, occurring, hydrate, of, magnesium, sulfate, as, a, mineral, even, though, it, is, formed, and, stable, only, below, 2, c, as, of, july, 2024, 6, 062, mineral, species, are, approved, by, the, ima, they, are, most, commonly, named, after, a, person, followed, by, discovery, location, names, based, on, chemical, composition, or, physical, properties, are, the, two, other, major, groups, of, mineral, name, etymologies, most, names, end, in, ite, the, exceptions, are, usually, names, that, were, well, established, before, the, organization, of, mineralogy, as, a, discipline, for, example, galena, and, diamond, a, topic, of, contention, among, geologists, and, mineralogists, has, been, the, ima, s, decision, to, exclude, biogenic, crystalline, substances, for, example, lowenstam, 1981, stated, that, organisms, are, capable, of, forming, a, diverse, array, of, minerals, some, of, which, cannot, be, formed, inorganically, in, the, biosphere, skinner, 2005, views, all, solids, as, potential, minerals, and, includes, biominerals, in, the, mineral, kingdom, which, are, those, that, are, created, by, the, metabolic, activities, of, organisms, skinner, expanded, the, previous, definition, of, a, mineral, to, classify, element, or, compound, amorphous, or, crystalline, formed, through, biogeochemical, processes, as, a, mineral, recent, advances, in, high, resolution, genetics, and, x, ray, absorption, spectroscopy, are, providing, revelations, on, the, biogeochemical, relations, between, microorganisms, and, minerals, that, may, shed, new, light, on, this, question, for, example, the, ima, commissioned, working, group, on, environmental, mineralogy, and, geochemistry, deals, with, minerals, in, the, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and, biosphere, the, group, s, scope, includes, mineral, forming, microorganisms, which, exist, on, nearly, every, rock, soil, and, particle, surface, spanning, the, globe, to, depths, of, at, least, 1600, metres, below, the, sea, floor, and, 70, kilometres, into, the, stratosphere, possibly, entering, the, mesosphere, biogeochemical, cycles, have, contributed, to, the, formation, of, minerals, for, billions, of, years, microorganisms, can, precipitate, metals, from, solution, contributing, to, the, formation, of, ore, deposits, they, can, also, catalyze, the, dissolution, of, minerals, prior, to, the, international, mineralogical, association, s, listing, over, 60, biominerals, had, been, discovered, named, and, published, these, minerals, a, sub, set, tabulated, in, lowenstam, 1981, are, considered, minerals, proper, according, to, skinner, s, 2005, definition, these, biominerals, are, not, listed, in, the, international, mineral, association, official, list, of, mineral, names, however, many, of, these, biomineral, representatives, are, distributed, amongst, the, 78, mineral, classes, listed, in, the, dana, classification, scheme, skinner, s, 2005, definition, of, a, mineral, takes, this, matter, into, account, by, stating, that, a, mineral, can, be, crystalline, or, amorphous, although, biominerals, are, not, the, most, common, form, of, minerals, they, help, to, define, the, limits, of, what, constitutes, a, mineral, proper, nickel, s, 1995, formal, definition, explicitly, mentioned, crystallinity, as, a, key, to, defining, a, substance, as, a, mineral, a, 2011, article, defined, icosahedrite, an, aluminium, iron, copper, alloy, as, a, mineral, named, for, its, unique, natural, icosahedral, symmetry, it, is, a, quasicrystal, unlike, a, true, crystal, quasicrystals, are, ordered, but, not, periodic, a, rock, is, an, aggregate, of, one, or, more, minerals, or, mineraloids, some, rocks, such, as, limestone, or, quartzite, are, composed, primarily, of, one, mineral, calcite, or, aragonite, in, the, case, of, limestone, and, quartz, in, the, latter, case, other, rocks, can, be, defined, by, relative, abundances, of, key, essential, minerals, a, granite, is, defined, by, proportions, of, quartz, alkali, feldspar, and, plagioclase, feldspar, the, other, minerals, in, the, rock, are, termed, accessory, minerals, and, do, not, greatly, affect, the, bulk, composition, of, the, rock, rocks, can, also, be, composed, entirely, of, non, mineral, material, coal, is, a, sedimentary, rock, composed, primarily, of, organically, derived, carbon, in, rocks, some, mineral, species, and, groups, are, much, more, abundant, than, others, these, are, termed, the, rock, forming, minerals, the, major, examples, of, these, are, quartz, the, feldspars, the, micas, the, amphiboles, the, pyroxenes, the, olivines, and, calcite, except, for, the, last, one, all, of, these, minerals, are, silicates, overall, around, 150, minerals, are, considered, particularly, important, whether, in, terms, of, their, abundance, or, aesthetic, value, in, terms, of, collecting, commercially, valuable, minerals, and, rocks, other, than, gemstones, metal, ores, or, mineral, fuels, are, referred, to, as, industrial, minerals, for, example, muscovite, a, white, mica, can, be, used, for, windows, sometimes, referred, to, as, isinglass, as, a, filler, or, as, an, insulator, ores, are, minerals, that, have, a, high, concentration, of, a, certain, element, typically, a, metal, examples, are, cinnabar, hgs, an, ore, of, mercury, sphalerite, zns, an, ore, of, zinc, cassiterite, sno, 2, an, ore, of, tin, and, colemanite, an, ore, of, boron, gems, are, minerals, with, an, ornamental, value, and, are, distinguished, from, non, gems, by, their, beauty, durability, and, usually, rarity, there, are, about, 20, mineral, species, that, qualify, as, gem, minerals, which, constitute, about, 35, of, the, most, common, gemstones, gem, minerals, are, often, present, in, several, varieties, and, so, one, mineral, can, account, for, several, different, gemstones, for, example, ruby, and, sapphire, are, both, corundum, al, 2, o, 3, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, mineral, in, the, english, language, middle, english, was, the, 15th, century, the, word, came, from, medieval, latin, minerale, from, minera, mine, ore, the, word, species, comes, from, the, latin, species, a, particular, sort, kind, or, type, with, distinct, look, or, appearance, the, abundance, and, diversity, of, minerals, is, controlled, directly, by, their, chemistry, in, turn, dependent, on, elemental, abundances, in, the, earth, the, majority, of, minerals, observed, are, derived, from, the, earth, s, crust, eight, elements, account, for, most, of, the, key, components, of, minerals, due, to, their, abundance, in, the, crust, these, eight, elements, summing, to, over, 98, of, the, crust, by, weight, are, in, order, of, decreasing, abundance, oxygen, silicon, aluminium, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and, potassium, oxygen, and, silicon, are, by, far, the, two, most, important, oxygen, composes, 47, of, the, crust, by, weight, and, silicon, accounts, for, 28, the, minerals, that, form, are, those, that, are, most, stable, at, the, temperature, and, pressure, of, formation, within, the, limits, imposed, by, the, bulk, chemistry, of, the, parent, body, for, example, in, most, igneous, rocks, the, aluminium, and, alkali, metals, sodium, and, potassium, that, are, present, are, primarily, found, in, combination, with, oxygen, silicon, and, calcium, as, feldspar, minerals, however, if, the, rock, is, unusually, rich, in, alkali, metals, there, will, not, be, enough, aluminium, to, combine, with, all, the, sodium, as, feldspar, and, the, excess, sodium, will, form, sodic, amphiboles, such, as, riebeckite, if, the, aluminium, abundance, is, unusually, high, the, excess, aluminium, will, form, muscovite, or, other, aluminium, rich, minerals, if, silicon, is, deficient, part, of, the, feldspar, will, be, replaced, by, feldspathoid, minerals, precise, predictions, of, which, minerals, will, be, present, in, a, rock, of, a, particular, composition, formed, at, a, particular, temperature, and, pressure, requires, complex, thermodynamic, calculations, however, approximate, estimates, may, be, made, using, relatively, simple, rules, of, thumb, such, as, the, cipw, norm, which, gives, reasonable, estimates, for, volcanic, rock, formed, from, dry, magma, the, chemical, composition, may, vary, between, end, member, species, of, a, solid, solution, series, for, example, the, plagioclase, feldspars, comprise, a, continuous, series, from, sodium, rich, end, member, albite, naalsi, 3, o, 8, to, calcium, rich, anorthite, caal, 2, si, 2, o, 8, with, four, recognized, intermediate, varieties, between, them, given, in, order, from, sodium, to, calcium, rich, oligoclase, andesine, labradorite, and, bytownite, other, examples, of, series, include, the, olivine, series, of, magnesium, rich, forsterite, and, iron, rich, fayalite, and, the, wolframite, series, of, manganese, rich, h, bnerite, and, iron, rich, ferberite, chemical, substitution, and, coordination, polyhedra, explain, this, common, feature, of, minerals, in, nature, minerals, are, not, pure, substances, and, are, contaminated, by, whatever, other, elements, are, present, in, the, given, chemical, system, as, a, result, it, is, possible, for, one, element, to, be, substituted, for, another, chemical, substitution, will, occur, between, ions, of, a, similar, size, and, charge, for, example, k, will, not, substitute, for, si, 4, because, of, chemical, and, structural, incompatibilities, caused, by, a, big, difference, in, size, and, charge, a, common, example, of, chemical, substitution, is, that, of, si, 4, by, al, 3, which, are, close, in, charge, size, and, abundance, in, the, crust, in, the, example, of, plagioclase, there, are, three, cases, of, substitution, feldspars, are, all, framework, silicates, which, have, a, silicon, oxygen, ratio, of, 2, 1, and, the, space, for, other, elements, is, given, by, the, substitution, of, si, 4, by, al, 3, to, give, a, base, unit, of, without, the, substitution, the, formula, would, be, charge, balanced, as, sio, 2, giving, quartz, the, significance, of, this, structural, property, will, be, explained, further, by, coordination, polyhedra, the, second, substitution, occurs, between, na, and, ca, 2, however, the, difference, in, charge, has, to, accounted, for, by, making, a, second, substitution, of, si, 4, by, al, 3, coordination, polyhedra, are, geometric, representations, of, how, a, cation, is, surrounded, by, an, anion, in, mineralogy, coordination, polyhedra, are, usually, considered, in, terms, of, oxygen, due, its, abundance, in, the, crust, the, base, unit, of, silicate, minerals, is, the, silica, tetrahedron, one, si, 4, surrounded, by, four, o, 2, an, alternate, way, of, describing, the, coordination, of, the, silicate, is, by, a, number, in, the, case, of, the, silica, tetrahedron, the, silicon, is, said, to, have, a, coordination, number, of, 4, various, cations, have, a, specific, range, of, possible, coordination, numbers, for, silicon, it, is, almost, always, 4, except, for, very, high, pressure, minerals, where, the, compound, is, compressed, such, that, silicon, is, in, six, fold, octahedral, coordination, with, oxygen, bigger, cations, have, a, bigger, coordination, numbers, because, of, the, increase, in, relative, size, as, compared, to, oxygen, the, last, orbital, subshell, of, heavier, atoms, is, different, too, changes, in, coordination, numbers, leads, to, physical, and, mineralogical, differences, for, example, at, high, pressure, such, as, in, the, mantle, many, minerals, especially, silicates, such, as, olivine, and, garnet, will, change, to, a, perovskite, structure, where, silicon, is, in, octahedral, coordination, other, examples, are, the, aluminosilicates, kyanite, andalusite, and, sillimanite, polymorphs, since, they, share, the, formula, al, 2, sio, 5, which, differ, by, the, coordination, number, of, the, al, 3, these, minerals, transition, from, one, another, as, a, response, to, changes, in, pressure, and, temperature, in, the, case, of, silicate, materials, the, substitution, of, si, 4, by, al, 3, allows, for, a, variety, of, minerals, because, of, the, need, to, balance, charges, because, the, eight, most, common, elements, make, up, over, 98, of, the, earth, s, crust, the, small, quantities, of, the, other, elements, that, are, typically, present, are, substituted, into, the, common, rock, forming, minerals, the, distinctive, minerals, of, most, elements, are, quite, rare, being, found, only, where, these, elements, have, been, concentrated, by, geological, processes, such, as, hydrothermal, circulation, to, the, point, where, they, can, no, longer, be, accommodated, in, common, minerals, changes, in, temperature, and, pressure, and, composition, alter, the, mineralogy, of, a, rock, sample, changes, in, composition, can, be, caused, by, processes, such, as, weathering, or, metasomatism, hydrothermal, alteration, changes, in, temperature, and, pressure, occur, when, the, host, rock, undergoes, tectonic, or, magmatic, movement, into, differing, physical, regimes, changes, in, thermodynamic, conditions, make, it, favourable, for, mineral, assemblages, to, react, with, each, other, to, produce, new, minerals, as, such, it, is, possible, for, two, rocks, to, have, an, identical, or, a, very, similar, bulk, rock, chemistry, without, having, a, similar, mineralogy, this, process, of, mineralogical, alteration, is, related, to, the, rock, cycle, an, example, of, a, series, of, mineral, reactions, is, illustrated, as, follows, orthoclase, feldspar, kalsi, 3, o, 8, is, a, mineral, commonly, found, in, granite, a, plutonic, igneous, rock, when, exposed, to, weathering, it, reacts, to, form, kaolinite, al, 2, si, 2, o, 5, oh, 4, a, sedimentary, mineral, and, silicic, acid, under, low, grade, metamorphic, conditions, kaolinite, reacts, with, quartz, to, form, pyrophyllite, al, 2, si, 4, o, 10, oh, 2, as, metamorphic, grade, increases, the, pyrophyllite, reacts, to, form, kyanite, and, quartz, alternatively, a, mineral, may, change, its, crystal, structure, as, a, consequence, of, changes, in, temperature, and, pressure, without, reacting, for, example, quartz, will, change, into, a, variety, of, its, sio, 2, polymorphs, such, as, tridymite, and, cristobalite, at, high, temperatures, and, coesite, at, high, pressures, classifying, minerals, ranges, from, simple, to, difficult, a, mineral, can, be, identified, by, several, physical, properties, some, of, them, being, sufficient, for, full, identification, without, equivocation, in, other, cases, minerals, can, only, be, classified, by, more, complex, optical, chemical, or, x, ray, diffraction, analysis, these, methods, however, can, be, costly, and, time, consuming, physical, properties, applied, for, classification, include, crystal, structure, and, habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage, and, fracture, and, specific, gravity, other, less, general, tests, include, fluorescence, phosphorescence, magnetism, radioactivity, tenacity, response, to, mechanical, induced, changes, of, shape, or, form, piezoelectricity, and, reactivity, to, dilute, acids, crystal, structure, results, from, the, orderly, geometric, spatial, arrangement, of, atoms, in, the, internal, structure, of, a, mineral, this, crystal, structure, is, based, on, regular, internal, atomic, or, ionic, arrangement, that, is, often, expressed, in, the, geometric, form, that, the, crystal, takes, even, when, the, mineral, grains, are, too, small, to, see, or, are, irregularly, shaped, the, underlying, crystal, structure, is, always, periodic, and, can, be, determined, by, x, ray, diffraction, minerals, are, typically, described, by, their, symmetry, content, crystals, are, restricted, to, 32, point, groups, which, differ, by, their, symmetry, these, groups, are, classified, in, turn, into, more, broad, categories, the, most, encompassing, of, these, being, the, six, crystal, families, these, families, can, be, described, by, the, relative, lengths, of, the, three, crystallographic, axes, and, the, angles, between, them, these, relationships, correspond, to, the, symmetry, operations, that, define, the, narrower, point, groups, they, are, summarized, below, a, b, and, c, represent, the, axes, and, represent, the, angle, opposite, the, respective, crystallographic, axis, e, g, is, the, angle, opposite, the, a, axis, viz, the, angle, between, the, b, and, c, axes, the, hexagonal, crystal, family, is, also, split, into, two, crystal, systems, the, trigonal, which, has, a, three, fold, axis, of, symmetry, and, the, hexagonal, which, has, a, six, fold, axis, of, symmetry, chemistry, and, crystal, structure, together, define, a, mineral, with, a, restriction, to, 32, point, groups, minerals, of, different, chemistry, may, have, identical, crystal, structure, for, example, halite, nacl, galena, pbs, and, periclase, mgo, all, belong, to, the, hexaoctahedral, point, group, isometric, family, as, they, have, a, similar, stoichiometry, between, their, different, constituent, elements, in, contrast, polymorphs, are, groupings, of, minerals, that, share, a, chemical, formula, but, have, a, different, structure, for, example, pyrite, and, marcasite, both, iron, sulfides, have, the, formula, fes, 2, however, the, former, is, isometric, while, the, latter, is, orthorhombic, this, polymorphism, extends, to, other, sulfides, with, the, generic, ax, 2, formula, these, two, groups, are, collectively, known, as, the, pyrite, and, marcasite, groups, polymorphism, can, extend, beyond, pure, symmetry, content, the, aluminosilicates, are, a, group, of, three, minerals, kyanite, andalusite, and, sillimanite, which, share, the, chemical, formula, al, 2, sio, 5, kyanite, is, triclinic, while, andalusite, and, sillimanite, are, both, orthorhombic, and, belong, to, the, dipyramidal, point, group, these, differences, arise, corresponding, to, how, aluminium, is, coordinated, within, the, crystal, structure, in, all, minerals, one, aluminium, ion, is, always, in, six, fold, coordination, with, oxygen, silicon, as, a, general, rule, is, in, four, fold, coordination, in, all, minerals, an, exception, is, a, case, like, stishovite, sio, 2, an, ultra, high, pressure, quartz, polymorph, with, rutile, structure, in, kyanite, the, second, aluminium, is, in, six, fold, coordination, its, chemical, formula, can, be, expressed, as, al, al, sio, 5, to, reflect, its, crystal, structure, andalusite, has, the, second, aluminium, in, five, fold, coordination, al, al, sio, 5, and, sillimanite, has, it, in, four, fold, coordination, al, al, sio, 5, differences, in, crystal, structure, and, chemistry, greatly, influence, other, physical, properties, of, the, mineral, the, carbon, allotropes, diamond, and, graphite, have, vastly, different, properties, diamond, is, the, hardest, natural, substance, has, an, adamantine, lustre, and, belongs, to, the, isometric, crystal, family, whereas, graphite, is, very, soft, has, a, greasy, lustre, and, crystallises, in, the, hexagonal, family, this, difference, is, accounted, for, by, differences, in, bonding, in, diamond, the, carbons, are, in, sp, 3, hybrid, orbitals, which, means, they, form, a, framework, where, each, carbon, is, covalently, bonded, to, four, neighbours, in, a, tetrahedral, fashion, on, the, other, hand, graphite, is, composed, of, sheets, of, carbons, in, sp, 2, hybrid, orbitals, where, each, carbon, is, bonded, covalently, to, only, three, others, these, sheets, are, held, together, by, much, weaker, van, der, waals, forces, and, this, discrepancy, translates, to, large, macroscopic, differences, twinning, is, the, intergrowth, of, two, or, more, crystals, of, a, single, mineral, species, the, geometry, of, the, twinning, is, controlled, by, the, mineral, s, symmetry, as, a, result, there, are, several, types, of, twins, including, contact, twins, reticulated, twins, geniculated, twins, penetration, twins, cyclic, twins, and, polysynthetic, twins, contact, or, simple, twins, consist, of, two, crystals, joined, at, a, plane, this, type, of, twinning, is, common, in, spinel, reticulated, twins, common, in, rutile, are, interlocking, crystals, resembling, netting, geniculated, twins, have, a, bend, in, the, middle, that, is, caused, by, start, of, the, twin, penetration, twins, consist, of, two, single, crystals, that, have, grown, into, each, other, examples, of, this, twinning, include, cross, shaped, staurolite, twins, and, carlsbad, twinning, in, orthoclase, cyclic, twins, are, caused, by, repeated, twinning, around, a, rotation, axis, this, type, of, twinning, occurs, around, three, four, five, six, or, eight, fold, axes, and, the, corresponding, patterns, are, called, threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and, eightlings, sixlings, are, common, in, aragonite, polysynthetic, twins, are, similar, to, cyclic, twins, through, the, presence, of, repetitive, twinning, however, instead, of, occurring, around, a, rotational, axis, polysynthetic, twinning, occurs, along, parallel, planes, usually, on, a, microscopic, scale, crystal, habit, refers, to, the, overall, shape, of, crystal, several, terms, are, used, to, describe, this, property, common, habits, include, acicular, which, describes, needlelike, crystals, as, in, natrolite, bladed, dendritic, tree, pattern, common, in, native, copper, equant, which, is, typical, of, garnet, prismatic, elongated, in, one, direction, and, tabular, which, differs, from, bladed, habit, in, that, the, former, is, platy, whereas, the, latter, has, a, defined, elongation, related, to, crystal, form, the, quality, of, crystal, faces, is, diagnostic, of, some, minerals, especially, with, a, petrographic, microscope, euhedral, crystals, have, a, defined, external, shape, while, anhedral, crystals, do, not, those, intermediate, forms, are, termed, subhedral, the, hardness, of, a, mineral, defines, how, much, it, can, resist, scratching, or, indentation, this, physical, property, is, controlled, by, the, chemical, composition, and, crystalline, structure, of, a, mineral, the, most, commonly, used, scale, of, measurement, is, the, ordinal, mohs, hardness, scale, which, measures, resistance, to, scratching, defined, by, ten, indicators, a, mineral, with, a, higher, index, scratches, those, below, it, the, scale, ranges, from, talc, a, phyllosilicate, to, diamond, a, carbon, polymorph, that, is, the, hardest, natural, material, the, scale, is, provided, below, a, mineral, s, hardness, is, a, function, of, its, structure, hardness, is, not, necessarily, constant, for, all, crystallographic, directions, crystallographic, weakness, renders, some, directions, softer, than, others, an, example, of, this, hardness, variability, exists, in, kyanite, which, has, a, mohs, hardness, of, 5, 1, 2, parallel, to, but, 7, parallel, to, other, scales, include, these, lustre, indicates, how, light, reflects, from, the, mineral, s, surface, with, regards, to, its, quality, and, intensity, there, are, numerous, qualitative, terms, used, to, describe, this, property, which, are, split, into, metallic, and, non, metallic, categories, metallic, and, sub, metallic, minerals, have, high, reflectivity, like, metal, examples, of, minerals, with, this, lustre, are, galena, and, pyrite, non, metallic, lustres, include, adamantine, such, as, in, diamond, vitreous, which, is, a, glassy, lustre, very, common, in, silicate, minerals, pearly, such, as, in, talc, and, apophyllite, resinous, such, as, members, of, the, garnet, group, silky, which, is, common, in, fibrous, minerals, such, as, asbestiform, chrysotile, the, diaphaneity, of, a, mineral, describes, the, ability, of, light, to, pass, through, it, transparent, minerals, do, not, diminish, the, intensity, of, light, passing, through, them, an, example, of, a, transparent, mineral, is, muscovite, potassium, mica, some, varieties, are, sufficiently, clear, to, have, been, used, for, windows, translucent, minerals, allow, some, light, to, pass, but, less, than, those, that, are, transparent, jadeite, and, nephrite, mineral, forms, of, jade, are, examples, of, minerals, with, this, property, minerals, that, do, not, allow, light, to, pass, are, called, opaque, the, diaphaneity, of, a, mineral, depends, on, the, thickness, of, the, sample, when, a, mineral, is, sufficiently, thin, e, g, in, a, thin, section, for, petrography, it, may, become, transparent, even, if, that, property, is, not, seen, in, a, hand, sample, in, contrast, some, minerals, such, as, hematite, or, pyrite, are, opaque, even, in, thin, section, colour, is, the, most, obvious, property, of, a, mineral, but, it, is, often, non, diagnostic, it, is, caused, by, electromagnetic, radiation, interacting, with, electrons, except, in, the, case, of, incandescence, which, does, not, apply, to, minerals, two, broad, classes, of, elements, idiochromatic, and, allochromatic, are, defined, with, regards, to, their, contribution, to, a, mineral, s, colour, idiochromatic, elements, are, essential, to, a, mineral, s, composition, their, contribution, to, a, mineral, s, colour, is, diagnostic, examples, of, such, minerals, are, malachite, green, and, azurite, blue, in, contrast, allochromatic, elements, in, minerals, are, present, in, trace, amounts, as, impurities, an, example, of, such, a, mineral, would, be, the, ruby, and, sapphire, varieties, of, the, mineral, corundum, the, colours, of, pseudochromatic, minerals, are, the, result, of, interference, of, light, waves, examples, include, labradorite, and, bornite, in, addition, to, simple, body, colour, minerals, can, have, various, other, distinctive, optical, properties, such, as, play, of, colours, asterism, chatoyancy, iridescence, tarnish, and, pleochroism, several, of, these, properties, involve, variability, in, colour, play, of, colour, such, as, in, opal, results, in, the, sample, reflecting, different, colours, as, it, is, turned, while, pleochroism, describes, the, change, in, colour, as, light, passes, through, a, mineral, in, a, different, orientation, iridescence, is, a, variety, of, the, play, of, colours, where, light, scatters, off, a, coating, on, the, surface, of, crystal, cleavage, planes, or, off, layers, having, minor, gradations, in, chemistry, in, contrast, the, play, of, colours, in, opal, is, caused, by, light, refracting, from, ordered, microscopic, silica, spheres, within, its, physical, structure, chatoyancy, cat, s, eye, is, the, wavy, banding, of, colour, that, is, observed, as, the, sample, is, rotated, asterism, a, variety, of, chatoyancy, gives, the, appearance, of, a, star, on, the, mineral, grain, the, latter, property, is, particularly, common, in, gem, quality, corundum, the, streak, of, a, mineral, refers, to, the, colour, of, a, mineral, in, powdered, form, which, may, or, may, not, be, identical, to, its, body, colour, the, most, common, way, of, testing, this, property, is, done, with, a, streak, plate, which, is, made, out, of, porcelain, and, coloured, either, white, or, black, the, streak, of, a, mineral, is, independent, of, trace, elements, or, any, weathering, surface, a, common, example, of, this, property, is, illustrated, with, hematite, which, is, coloured, black, silver, or, red, in, hand, sample, but, has, a, cherry, red, to, reddish, brown, streak, streak, is, more, often, distinctive, for, metallic, minerals, in, contrast, to, non, metallic, minerals, whose, body, colour, is, created, by, allochromatic, elements, streak, testing, is, constrained, by, the, hardness, of, the, mineral, as, those, harder, than, 7, powder, the, streak, plate, instead, by, definition, minerals, have, a, characteristic, atomic, arrangement, weakness, in, this, crystalline, structure, causes, planes, of, weakness, and, the, breakage, of, a, mineral, along, such, planes, is, termed, cleavage, the, quality, of, cleavage, can, be, described, based, on, how, cleanly, and, easily, the, mineral, breaks, common, descriptors, in, order, of, decreasing, quality, are, perfect, good, distinct, and, poor, in, particularly, transparent, minerals, or, in, thin, section, cleavage, can, be, seen, as, a, series, of, parallel, lines, marking, the, planar, surfaces, when, viewed, from, the, side, cleavage, is, not, a, universal, property, among, minerals, for, example, quartz, consisting, of, extensively, interconnected, silica, tetrahedra, does, not, have, a, crystallographic, weakness, which, would, allow, it, to, cleave, in, contrast, micas, which, have, perfect, basal, cleavage, consist, of, sheets, of, silica, tetrahedra, which, are, very, weakly, held, together, as, cleavage, is, a, function, of, crystallography, there, are, a, variety, of, cleavage, types, cleavage, occurs, typically, in, either, one, two, three, four, or, six, directions, basal, cleavage, in, one, direction, is, a, distinctive, property, of, the, micas, two, directional, cleavage, is, described, as, prismatic, and, occurs, in, minerals, such, as, the, amphiboles, and, pyroxenes, minerals, such, as, galena, or, halite, have, cubic, or, isometric, cleavage, in, three, directions, at, 90, when, three, directions, of, cleavage, are, present, but, not, at, 90, such, as, in, calcite, or, rhodochrosite, it, is, termed, rhombohedral, cleavage, octahedral, cleavage, four, directions, is, present, in, fluorite, and, diamond, and, sphalerite, has, six, directional, dodecahedral, cleavage, minerals, with, many, cleavages, might, not, break, equally, well, in, all, of, the, directions, for, example, calcite, has, good, cleavage, in, three, directions, but, gypsum, has, perfect, cleavage, in, one, direction, and, poor, cleavage, in, two, other, directions, angles, between, cleavage, planes, vary, between, minerals, for, example, as, the, amphiboles, are, double, chain, silicates, and, the, pyroxenes, are, single, chain, silicates, the, angle, between, their, cleavage, planes, is, different, the, pyroxenes, cleave, in, two, directions, at, approximately, 90, whereas, the, amphiboles, distinctively, cleave, in, two, directions, separated, by, approximately, 120, and, 60, the, cleavage, angles, can, be, measured, with, a, contact, goniometer, which, is, similar, to, a, protractor, parting, sometimes, called, false, cleavage, is, similar, in, appearance, to, cleavage, but, is, instead, produced, by, structural, defects, in, the, mineral, as, opposed, to, systematic, weakness, parting, varies, from, crystal, to, crystal, of, a, mineral, whereas, all, crystals, of, a, given, mineral, will, cleave, if, the, atomic, structure, allows, for, that, property, in, general, parting, is, caused, by, some, stress, applied, to, a, crystal, the, sources, of, the, stresses, include, deformation, e, g, an, increase, in, pressure, exsolution, or, twinning, minerals, that, often, display, parting, include, the, pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and, corundum, when, a, mineral, is, broken, in, a, direction, that, does, not, correspond, to, a, plane, of, cleavage, it, is, termed, to, have, been, fractured, there, are, several, types, of, uneven, fracture, the, classic, example, is, conchoidal, fracture, like, that, of, quartz, rounded, surfaces, are, created, which, are, marked, by, smooth, curved, lines, this, type, of, fracture, occurs, only, in, very, homogeneous, minerals, other, types, of, fracture, are, fibrous, splintery, and, hackly, the, latter, describes, a, break, along, a, rough, jagged, surface, an, example, of, this, property, is, found, in, native, copper, tenacity, is, related, to, both, cleavage, and, fracture, whereas, fracture, and, cleavage, describes, the, surfaces, that, are, created, when, a, mineral, is, broken, tenacity, describes, how, resistant, a, mineral, is, to, such, breaking, minerals, can, be, described, as, brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or, elastic, specific, gravity, numerically, describes, the, density, of, a, mineral, the, dimensions, of, density, are, mass, divided, by, volume, with, units, kg, m, 3, or, g, cm, 3, specific, gravity, is, defined, as, the, density, of, the, mineral, divided, by, the, density, of, water, at, 4, c, and, thus, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, identical, in, all, unit, systems, it, can, be, measured, as, the, quotient, of, the, mass, of, the, sample, and, difference, between, the, weight, of, the, sample, in, air, and, its, corresponding, weight, in, water, among, most, minerals, this, property, is, not, diagnostic, rock, forming, minerals, typically, silicates, or, occasionally, carbonates, have, a, specific, gravity, of, 2, 5, 3, 5, high, specific, gravity, is, a, diagnostic, property, of, a, mineral, a, variation, in, chemistry, and, consequently, mineral, class, correlates, to, a, change, in, specific, gravity, among, more, common, minerals, oxides, and, sulfides, tend, to, have, a, higher, specific, gravity, as, they, include, elements, with, higher, atomic, mass, a, generalization, is, that, minerals, with, metallic, or, adamantine, lustre, tend, to, have, higher, specific, gravities, than, those, having, a, non, metallic, to, dull, lustre, for, example, hematite, fe, 2, o, 3, has, a, specific, gravity, of, 5, 26, while, galena, pbs, has, a, specific, gravity, of, 7, 2, 7, 6, which, is, a, result, of, their, high, iron, and, lead, content, respectively, a, very, high, specific, gravity, is, characteristic, of, native, metals, for, example, kamacite, an, iron, nickel, alloy, common, in, iron, meteorites, has, a, specific, gravity, of, 7, 9, and, gold, has, an, observed, specific, gravity, between, 15, and, 19, 3, other, properties, can, be, used, to, diagnose, minerals, these, are, less, general, and, apply, to, specific, minerals, dropping, dilute, acid, often, 10, hcl, onto, a, mineral, aids, in, distinguishing, carbonates, from, other, mineral, classes, the, acid, reacts, with, the, carbonate, 2, group, which, causes, the, affected, area, to, effervesce, giving, off, carbon, dioxide, gas, this, test, can, be, further, expanded, to, test, the, mineral, in, its, original, crystal, form, or, powdered, form, an, example, of, this, test, is, done, when, distinguishing, calcite, from, dolomite, especially, within, the, rocks, limestone, and, dolomite, respectively, calcite, immediately, effervesces, in, acid, whereas, acid, must, be, applied, to, powdered, dolomite, often, to, a, scratched, surface, in, a, rock, for, it, to, effervesce, zeolite, minerals, will, not, effervesce, in, acid, instead, they, become, frosted, after, 5, 10, minutes, and, if, left, in, acid, for, a, day, they, dissolve, or, become, a, silica, gel, magnetism, is, a, very, conspicuous, property, of, a, few, minerals, among, common, minerals, magnetite, exhibits, this, property, strongly, and, magnetism, is, also, present, albeit, not, as, strongly, in, pyrrhotite, and, ilmenite, some, minerals, exhibit, electrical, properties, for, example, quartz, is, piezoelectric, but, electrical, properties, are, rarely, used, as, diagnostic, criteria, for, minerals, because, of, incomplete, data, and, natural, variation, minerals, can, also, be, tested, for, taste, or, smell, halite, nacl, is, table, salt, its, potassium, bearing, counterpart, sylvite, has, a, pronounced, bitter, taste, sulfides, have, a, characteristic, smell, especially, as, samples, are, fractured, reacting, or, powdered, radioactivity, is, a, rare, property, found, in, minerals, containing, radioactive, elements, the, radioactive, elements, could, be, a, defining, constituent, such, as, uranium, in, uraninite, autunite, and, carnotite, or, present, as, trace, impurities, as, in, zircon, the, decay, of, a, radioactive, element, damages, the, mineral, crystal, structure, rendering, it, locally, amorphous, metamict, state, the, optical, result, termed, a, radioactive, halo, or, pleochroic, halo, is, observable, with, various, techniques, such, as, thin, section, petrography, in, 315, bce, theophrastus, presented, his, classification, of, minerals, in, his, treatise, on, stones, his, classification, was, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, his, teachers, plato, and, aristotle, theophrastus, classified, minerals, as, stones, earths, or, metals, georgius, agricola, s, classification, of, minerals, in, his, book, de, natura, fossilium, published, in, 1546, divided, minerals, into, three, types, of, substance, simple, stones, earths, metals, and, congealed, juices, compound, intimately, mixed, and, composite, separable, an, early, classification, of, minerals, was, given, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, seminal, 1735, book, systema, naturae, he, divided, the, natural, world, into, three, kingdoms, plants, animals, and, minerals, and, classified, each, with, the, same, hierarchy, in, descending, order, these, were, phylum, class, order, family, tribe, genus, and, species, however, while, his, system, was, justified, by, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, species, formation, and, has, been, largely, adopted, and, expanded, by, biologists, in, the, following, centuries, who, still, use, his, greek, and, latin, based, binomial, naming, scheme, it, had, little, success, among, mineralogists, although, each, distinct, mineral, is, still, formally, referred, to, as, a, mineral, species, minerals, are, classified, by, variety, species, series, and, group, in, order, of, increasing, generality, the, basic, level, of, definition, is, that, of, mineral, species, each, of, which, is, distinguished, from, the, others, by, unique, chemical, and, physical, properties, for, example, quartz, is, defined, by, its, formula, sio, 2, and, a, specific, crystalline, structure, that, distinguishes, it, from, other, minerals, with, the, same, chemical, formula, termed, polymorphs, when, there, exists, a, range, of, composition, between, two, minerals, species, a, mineral, series, is, defined, for, example, the, biotite, series, is, represented, by, variable, amounts, of, the, endmembers, phlogopite, siderophyllite, annite, and, eastonite, in, contrast, a, mineral, group, is, a, grouping, of, mineral, species, with, some, common, chemical, properties, that, share, a, crystal, structure, the, pyroxene, group, has, a, common, formula, of, xy, si, al, 2, o, 6, where, x, and, y, are, both, cations, with, x, typically, bigger, than, y, the, pyroxenes, are, single, chain, silicates, that, crystallize, in, either, the, orthorhombic, or, monoclinic, crystal, systems, finally, a, mineral, variety, is, a, specific, type, of, mineral, species, that, differs, by, some, physical, characteristic, such, as, colour, or, crystal, habit, an, example, is, amethyst, which, is, a, purple, variety, of, quartz, two, common, classifications, dana, and, strunz, are, used, for, minerals, both, rely, on, composition, specifically, with, regards, to, important, chemical, groups, and, structure, james, dwight, dana, a, leading, geologist, of, his, time, first, published, his, system, of, mineralogy, in, 1837, as, of, 1997, it, is, in, its, eighth, edition, the, dana, classification, assigns, a, four, part, number, to, a, mineral, species, its, class, number, is, based, on, important, compositional, groups, the, type, gives, the, ratio, of, cations, to, anions, in, the, mineral, and, the, last, two, numbers, group, minerals, by, structural, similarity, within, a, given, type, or, class, the, less, commonly, used, strunz, classification, named, for, german, mineralogist, karl, hugo, strunz, is, based, on, the, dana, system, but, combines, both, chemical, and, structural, criteria, the, latter, with, regards, to, distribution, of, chemical, bonds, as, the, composition, of, the, earth, s, crust, is, dominated, by, silicon, and, oxygen, silicates, are, by, far, the, most, important, class, of, minerals, in, terms, of, rock, formation, and, diversity, however, non, silicate, minerals, are, of, great, economic, importance, especially, as, ores, non, silicate, minerals, are, subdivided, into, several, other, classes, by, their, dominant, chemistry, which, includes, native, elements, sulfides, halides, oxides, and, hydroxides, carbonates, and, nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and, organic, compounds, most, non, silicate, mineral, species, are, rare, constituting, in, total, 8, of, the, earth, s, crust, although, some, are, relatively, common, such, as, calcite, pyrite, magnetite, and, hematite, there, are, two, major, structural, styles, observed, in, non, silicates, close, packing, and, silicate, like, linked, tetrahedra, close, packed, structures, are, a, way, to, densely, pack, atoms, while, minimizing, interstitial, space, hexagonal, close, packing, involves, stacking, layers, where, every, other, layer, is, the, same, ababab, whereas, cubic, close, packing, involves, stacking, groups, of, three, layers, abcabcabc, analogues, to, linked, silica, tetrahedra, include, so, 4, 4, sulfate, po, 4, 4, phosphate, aso, 4, 4, arsenate, and, vo, 4, 4, vanadate, structures, the, non, silicates, have, great, economic, importance, as, they, concentrate, elements, more, than, the, silicate, minerals, do, the, largest, grouping, of, minerals, by, far, are, the, silicates, most, rocks, are, composed, of, greater, than, 95, silicate, minerals, and, over, 90, of, the, earth, s, crust, is, composed, of, these, minerals, the, two, main, constituents, of, silicates, are, silicon, and, oxygen, which, are, the, two, most, abundant, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, other, common, elements, in, silicate, minerals, correspond, to, other, common, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, such, as, aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and, potassium, some, important, rock, forming, silicates, include, the, feldspars, quartz, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and, micas, the, base, unit, of, a, silicate, mineral, is, the, 4, tetrahedron, in, the, vast, majority, of, cases, silicon, is, in, four, fold, or, tetrahedral, coordination, with, oxygen, in, very, high, pressure, situations, silicon, will, be, in, six, fold, or, octahedral, coordination, such, as, in, the, perovskite, structure, or, the, quartz, polymorph, stishovite, sio, 2, in, the, latter, case, the, mineral, no, longer, has, a, silicate, structure, but, that, of, rutile, tio, 2, and, its, associated, group, which, are, simple, oxides, these, silica, tetrahedra, are, then, polymerized, to, some, degree, to, create, various, structures, such, as, one, dimensional, chains, two, dimensional, sheets, and, three, dimensional, frameworks, the, basic, silicate, mineral, where, no, polymerization, of, the, tetrahedra, has, occurred, requires, other, elements, to, balance, out, the, base, 4, charge, in, other, silicate, structures, different, combinations, of, elements, are, required, to, balance, out, the, resultant, negative, charge, it, is, common, for, the, si, 4, to, be, substituted, by, al, 3, because, of, similarity, in, ionic, radius, and, charge, in, those, cases, the, 5, tetrahedra, form, the, same, structures, as, do, the, unsubstituted, tetrahedra, but, their, charge, balancing, requirements, are, different, the, degree, of, polymerization, can, be, described, by, both, the, structure, formed, and, how, many, tetrahedral, corners, or, coordinating, oxygens, are, shared, for, aluminium, and, silicon, in, tetrahedral, sites, the, silicate, subclasses, are, described, below, in, order, of, decreasing, polymerization, tectosilicates, also, known, as, framework, silicates, have, the, highest, degree, of, polymerization, with, all, corners, of, a, tetrahedra, shared, the, silicon, oxygen, ratio, becomes, 1, 2, examples, are, quartz, the, feldspars, feldspathoids, and, the, zeolites, framework, silicates, tend, to, be, particularly, chemically, stable, as, a, result, of, strong, covalent, bonds, forming, 12, of, the, earth, s, crust, quartz, sio, 2, is, the, most, abundant, mineral, species, it, is, characterized, by, its, high, chemical, and, physical, resistivity, quartz, has, several, polymorphs, including, tridymite, and, cristobalite, at, high, temperatures, high, pressure, coesite, and, ultra, high, pressure, stishovite, the, latter, mineral, can, only, be, formed, on, earth, by, meteorite, impacts, and, its, structure, has, been, compressed, so, much, that, it, has, changed, from, a, silicate, structure, to, that, of, rutile, tio, 2, the, silica, polymorph, that, is, most, stable, at, the, earth, s, surface, is, quartz, its, counterpart, quartz, is, present, only, at, high, temperatures, and, pressures, changes, to, quartz, below, 573, c, at, 1, bar, these, two, polymorphs, differ, by, a, kinking, of, bonds, this, change, in, structure, gives, quartz, greater, symmetry, than, quartz, and, they, are, thus, also, called, high, quartz, and, low, quartz, feldspars, are, the, most, abundant, group, in, the, earth, s, crust, at, about, 50, in, the, feldspars, al, 3, substitutes, for, si, 4, which, creates, a, charge, imbalance, that, must, be, accounted, for, by, the, addition, of, cations, the, base, structure, becomes, either, or, 2, there, are, 22, mineral, species, of, feldspars, subdivided, into, two, major, subgroups, alkali, and, plagioclase, and, two, less, common, groups, celsian, and, banalsite, the, alkali, feldspars, are, most, commonly, in, a, series, between, potassium, rich, orthoclase, and, sodium, rich, albite, in, the, case, of, plagioclase, the, most, common, series, ranges, from, albite, to, calcium, rich, anorthite, crystal, twinning, is, common, in, feldspars, especially, polysynthetic, twins, in, plagioclase, and, carlsbad, twins, in, alkali, feldspars, if, the, latter, subgroup, cools, slowly, from, a, melt, it, forms, exsolution, lamellae, because, the, two, components, orthoclase, and, albite, are, unstable, in, solid, solution, exsolution, can, be, on, a, scale, from, microscopic, to, readily, observable, in, hand, sample, perthitic, texture, forms, when, na, rich, feldspar, exsolve, in, a, k, rich, host, the, opposite, texture, antiperthitic, where, k, rich, feldspar, exsolves, in, a, na, rich, host, is, very, rare, feldspathoids, are, structurally, similar, to, feldspar, but, differ, in, that, they, form, in, si, deficient, conditions, which, allows, for, further, substitution, by, al, 3, as, a, result, feldspathoids, are, almost, never, found, in, association, with, quartz, a, common, example, of, a, feldspathoid, is, nepheline, na, k, alsio, 4, compared, to, alkali, feldspar, nepheline, has, an, al, 2, o, 3, sio, 2, ratio, of, 1, 2, as, opposed, to, 1, 6, in, alkali, feldspar, zeolites, often, have, distinctive, crystal, habits, occurring, in, needles, plates, or, blocky, masses, they, form, in, the, presence, of, water, at, low, temperatures, and, pressures, and, have, channels, and, voids, in, their, structure, zeolites, have, several, industrial, applications, especially, in, waste, water, treatment, phyllosilicates, consist, of, sheets, of, polymerized, tetrahedra, they, are, bound, at, three, oxygen, sites, which, gives, a, characteristic, silicon, oxygen, ratio, of, 2, 5, important, examples, include, the, mica, chlorite, and, the, kaolinite, serpentine, groups, in, addition, to, the, tetrahedra, phyllosilicates, have, a, sheet, of, octahedra, elements, in, six, fold, coordination, by, oxygen, that, balance, out, the, basic, tetrahedra, which, have, a, negative, charge, e, g, 4, these, tetrahedra, t, and, octahedra, o, sheets, are, stacked, in, a, variety, of, combinations, to, create, phyllosilicate, layers, within, an, octahedral, sheet, there, are, three, octahedral, sites, in, a, unit, structure, however, not, all, of, the, sites, may, be, occupied, in, that, case, the, mineral, is, termed, dioctahedral, whereas, in, other, case, it, is, termed, trioctahedral, the, layers, are, weakly, bound, by, van, der, waals, forces, hydrogen, bonds, or, sparse, ionic, bonds, which, causes, a, crystallographic, weakness, in, turn, leading, to, a, prominent, basal, cleavage, among, the, phyllosilicates, the, kaolinite, serpentine, group, consists, of, t, o, stacks, the, 1, 1, clay, minerals, their, hardness, ranges, from, 2, to, 4, as, the, sheets, are, held, by, hydrogen, bonds, the, 2, 1, clay, minerals, pyrophyllite, talc, consist, of, t, o, t, stacks, but, they, are, softer, hardness, from, 1, to, 2, as, they, are, instead, held, together, by, van, der, waals, forces, these, two, groups, of, minerals, are, subgrouped, by, octahedral, occupation, specifically, kaolinite, and, pyrophyllite, are, dioctahedral, whereas, serpentine, and, talc, trioctahedral, micas, are, also, t, o, t, stacked, phyllosilicates, but,

saline, waters, sulfates, can, also, be, found, in, hydrothermal, vein, systems, associated, with, sulfides, or, as, oxidation, products, of, sulfides, sulfates, can, be, subdivided, into, anhydrous, and, hydrous, minerals, the, most, common, hydrous, sulfate, by, far, is, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, it, forms, as, an, evaporite, and, is, associated, with, other, evaporites, such, as, calcite, and, halite, if, it, incorporates, sand, grains, as, it, crystallizes, gypsum, can, form, desert, roses, gypsum, has, very, low, thermal, conductivity, and, maintains, a, low, temperature, when, heated, as, it, loses, that, heat, by, dehydrating, as, such, gypsum, is, used, as, an, insulator, in, materials, such, as, plaster, and, drywall, the, anhydrous, equivalent, of, gypsum, is, anhydrite, it, can, form, directly, from, seawater, in, highly, arid, conditions, the, barite, group, has, the, general, formula, xso, 4, where, the, x, is, a, large, 12, coordinated, cation, examples, include, barite, baso, 4, celestine, srso, 4, and, anglesite, pbso, 4, anhydrite, is, not, part, of, the, barite, group, as, the, smaller, ca, 2, is, only, in, eight, fold, coordination, the, phosphate, minerals, are, characterized, by, the, tetrahedral, 3, unit, although, the, structure, can, be, generalized, and, phosphorus, is, replaced, by, antimony, arsenic, or, vanadium, the, most, common,

in, this, group, are, the, main, crystalline, constituents, of, teeth, and, bones, in, vertebrates, the, relatively, abundant, monazite, group, has, a, general, structure, of, ato, 4, where, t, is, phosphorus, or, arsenic, and, a, is, often, a, rare, earth, element, ree, monazite, is, important, in, two, ways, first, as, a, ree, sink, it, can, sufficiently, concentrate, these, elements, to, become, an, ore, secondly, monazite, group, elements, can, incorporate, relatively, large, amounts, of, uranium, and, thorium, which, can, be, used, in, monazite, geochronology, to, date, the, rock, based, on, the, decay, of, the, u, and, th, to, lead, the, strunz, classification, includes, a, class, for, organic, minerals, these, rare, compounds, contain, organic, carbon, but, can, be, formed, by, a, geologic, process, for, example, whewellite, cac, 2, o, 4, h, 2, o, is, an, oxalate, that, can, be, deposited, in, hydrothermal, ore, veins, while, hydrated, calcium, oxalate, can, be, found, in, coal, seams, and, other, sedimentary, deposits, involving, organic, matter, the, hydrothermal, occurrence, is, not, considered, to, be, related, to, biological, activity, mineral, classification, schemes, and, their, definitions, are, evolving, to, match, recent, advances, in, mineral, science, recent, changes, have, included, the, addition, of, an, organic, class, in, both, the, new, dana, and, the, strunz, classification, schemes, the, organic, class, includes, a, very, rare, group, of, minerals, with, hydrocarbons, the, ima, commission, on, new, minerals, and, mineral, names, adopted, in, 2009, a, hierarchical, scheme, for, the, naming, and, classification, of, mineral, groups, and, group, names, and, established, seven, commissions, and, four, working, groups, to, review, and, classify, minerals, into, an, official, listing, of, their, published, names, according, to, these, new, rules, mineral, species, can, be, grouped, in, a, number, of, different, ways, on, the, basis, of, chemistry, crystal, structure, occurrence, association, genetic, history, or, resource, for, example, depending, on, the, purpose, to, be, served, by, the, classification, it, has, been, suggested, that, biominerals, could, be, important, indicators, of, extraterrestrial, life, and, thus, could, play, an, important, role, in, the, search, for, past, or, present, life, on, mars, furthermore, organic, components, biosignatures, that, are, often, associated, with, biominerals, are, believed, to, play, crucial, roles, in, both, pre, biotic, and, biotic, reactions, in, january, 2014, nasa, reported, that, studies, by, the, curiosity, and, opportunity, rovers, on, mars, would, search, for, evidence, of, ancient, life, including, a, biosphere, based, on, autotrophic, chemotrophic, and, or, chemolithoautotrophic, microorganisms, as, well, as, ancient, water, including, fluvio, lacustrine, environments, plains, related, to, ancient, rivers, or, lakes, that, may, have, been, habitable, the, search, for, evidence, of, habitability, taphonomy, related, to, fossils, and, organic, carbon, on, the, planet, mars, became, a, primary, nasa, objective
