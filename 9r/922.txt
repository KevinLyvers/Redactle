electromagnetic, or, magnetic, induction, is, the, production, of, an, electromotive, force, emf, across, an, electrical, conductor, in, a, changing, magnetic, field, michael, faraday, is, generally, credited, with, the, discovery, of, induction, in, 1831, and, james, clerk, maxwell, mathematically, described, it, as, faraday, s, law, of, induction, lenz, s, law, describes, the, direction, of, the, induced, field, faraday, s, law, was, later, generalized, to, become, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, one, of, the, four, maxwell, equations, in, his, theory, of, electromagnetism, electromagnetic, induction, has, found, many, applications, including, electrical, components, such, as, inductors, and, transformers, and, devices, such, as, electric, motors, and, generators, electromagnetic, induction, was, discovered, by, michael, faraday, published, in, 1831, it, was, discovered, independently, by, joseph, henry, in, 1832, in, faraday, s, first, experimental, demonstration, august, 29, 1831, he, wrapped, two, wires, around, opposite, sides, of, an, iron, ring, or, torus, an, arrangement, similar, to, a, modern, toroidal, transformer, based, on, his, understanding, of, electromagnets, he, expected, that, when, current, started, to, flow, in, one, wire, a, sort, of, wave, would, travel, through, the, ring, and, cause, some, electrical, effect, on, the, opposite, side, he, plugged, one, wire, into, a, galvanometer, and, watched, it, as, he, connected, the, other, wire, to, a, battery, he, saw, a, transient, current, which, he, called, a, wave, of, electricity, when, he, connected, the, wire, to, the, battery, and, another, when, he, disconnected, it, this, induction, was, due, to, the, change, in, magnetic, flux, that, occurred, when, the, battery, was, connected, and, disconnected, within, two, months, faraday, found, several, other, manifestations, of, electromagnetic, induction, for, example, he, saw, transient, currents, when, he, quickly, slid, a, bar, magnet, in, and, out, of, a, coil, of, wires, and, he, generated, a, steady, dc, current, by, rotating, a, copper, disk, near, the, bar, magnet, with, a, sliding, electrical, lead, faraday, s, disk, faraday, explained, electromagnetic, induction, using, a, concept, he, called, lines, of, force, however, scientists, at, the, time, widely, rejected, his, theoretical, ideas, mainly, because, they, were, not, formulated, mathematically, an, exception, was, james, clerk, maxwell, who, used, faraday, s, ideas, as, the, basis, of, his, quantitative, electromagnetic, theory, in, maxwell, s, model, the, time, varying, aspect, of, electromagnetic, induction, is, expressed, as, a, differential, equation, which, oliver, heaviside, referred, to, as, faraday, s, law, even, though, it, is, slightly, different, from, faraday, s, original, formulation, and, does, not, describe, motional, emf, heaviside, s, version, see, maxwell, faraday, equation, below, is, the, form, recognized, today, in, the, group, of, equations, known, as, maxwell, s, equations, in, 1834, heinrich, lenz, formulated, the, law, named, after, him, to, describe, the, flux, through, the, circuit, lenz, s, law, gives, the, direction, of, the, induced, emf, and, current, resulting, from, electromagnetic, induction, faraday, s, law, of, induction, makes, use, of, the, magnetic, flux, b, through, a, region, of, space, enclosed, by, a, wire, loop, the, magnetic, flux, is, defined, by, a, surface, integral, b, b, d, a, displaystyle, phi, mathrm, b, int, sigma, mathbf, b, cdot, d, mathbf, a, where, d, a, is, an, element, of, the, surface, enclosed, by, the, wire, loop, b, is, the, magnetic, field, the, dot, product, b, d, a, corresponds, to, an, infinitesimal, amount, of, magnetic, flux, in, more, visual, terms, the, magnetic, flux, through, the, wire, loop, is, proportional, to, the, number, of, magnetic, field, lines, that, pass, through, the, loop, when, the, flux, through, the, surface, changes, faraday, s, law, of, induction, says, that, the, wire, loop, acquires, an, electromotive, force, emf, the, most, widespread, version, of, this, law, states, that, the, induced, electromotive, force, in, any, closed, circuit, is, equal, to, the, rate, of, change, of, the, magnetic, flux, enclosed, by, the, circuit, e, d, b, d, t, displaystyle, mathcal, e, frac, d, phi, mathrm, b, dt, where, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, is, the, emf, and, b, is, the, magnetic, flux, the, direction, of, the, electromotive, force, is, given, by, lenz, s, law, which, states, that, an, induced, current, will, flow, in, the, direction, that, will, oppose, the, change, which, produced, it, this, is, due, to, the, negative, sign, in, the, previous, equation, to, increase, the, generated, emf, a, common, approach, is, to, exploit, flux, linkage, by, creating, a, tightly, wound, coil, of, wire, composed, of, n, identical, turns, each, with, the, same, magnetic, flux, going, through, them, the, resulting, emf, is, then, n, times, that, of, one, single, wire, e, n, d, b, d, t, displaystyle, mathcal, e, n, frac, d, phi, mathrm, b, dt, generating, an, emf, through, a, variation, of, the, magnetic, flux, through, the, surface, of, a, wire, loop, can, be, achieved, in, several, ways, in, general, the, relation, between, the, emf, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, in, a, wire, loop, encircling, a, surface, and, the, electric, field, e, in, the, wire, is, given, by, e, e, d, displaystyle, mathcal, e, oint, partial, sigma, mathbf, e, cdot, d, boldsymbol, ell, where, d, is, an, element, of, contour, of, the, surface, combining, this, with, the, definition, of, flux, b, b, d, a, displaystyle, phi, mathrm, b, int, sigma, mathbf, b, cdot, d, mathbf, a, we, can, write, the, integral, form, of, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, e, d, d, d, t, b, d, a, displaystyle, oint, partial, sigma, mathbf, e, cdot, d, boldsymbol, ell, frac, d, dt, int, sigma, mathbf, b, cdot, d, mathbf, a, it, is, one, of, the, four, maxwell, s, equations, and, therefore, plays, a, fundamental, role, in, the, theory, of, classical, electromagnetism, faraday, s, law, describes, two, different, phenomena, the, motional, emf, generated, by, a, magnetic, force, on, a, moving, wire, see, lorentz, force, and, the, transformer, emf, that, is, generated, by, an, electric, force, due, to, a, changing, magnetic, field, due, to, the, differential, form, of, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, james, clerk, maxwell, drew, attention, to, the, separate, physical, phenomena, in, 1861, this, is, believed, to, be, a, unique, example, in, physics, of, where, such, a, fundamental, law, is, invoked, to, explain, two, such, different, phenomena, albert, einstein, noticed, that, the, two, situations, both, corresponded, to, a, relative, movement, between, a, conductor, and, a, magnet, and, the, outcome, was, unaffected, by, which, one, was, moving, this, was, one, of, the, principal, paths, that, led, him, to, develop, special, relativity, the, principles, of, electromagnetic, induction, are, applied, in, many, devices, and, systems, including, the, emf, generated, by, faraday, s, law, of, induction, due, to, relative, movement, of, a, circuit, and, a, magnetic, field, is, the, phenomenon, underlying, electrical, generators, when, a, permanent, magnet, is, moved, relative, to, a, conductor, or, vice, versa, an, electromotive, force, is, created, if, the, wire, is, connected, through, an, electrical, load, current, will, flow, and, thus, electrical, energy, is, generated, converting, the, mechanical, energy, of, motion, to, electrical, energy, for, example, the, drum, generator, is, based, upon, the, figure, to, the, bottom, right, a, different, implementation, of, this, idea, is, the, faraday, s, disc, shown, in, simplified, form, on, the, right, in, the, faraday, s, disc, example, the, disc, is, rotated, in, a, uniform, magnetic, field, perpendicular, to, the, disc, causing, a, current, to, flow, in, the, radial, arm, due, to, the, lorentz, force, mechanical, work, is, necessary, to, drive, this, current, when, the, generated, current, flows, through, the, conducting, rim, a, magnetic, field, is, generated, by, this, current, through, amp, re, s, circuital, law, labelled, induced, b, in, the, figure, the, rim, thus, becomes, an, electromagnet, that, resists, rotation, of, the, disc, an, example, of, lenz, s, law, on, the, far, side, of, the, figure, the, return, current, flows, from, the, rotating, arm, through, the, far, side, of, the, rim, to, the, bottom, brush, the, b, field, induced, by, this, return, current, opposes, the, applied, b, field, tending, to, decrease, the, flux, through, that, side, of, the, circuit, opposing, the, increase, in, flux, due, to, rotation, on, the, near, side, of, the, figure, the, return, current, flows, from, the, rotating, arm, through, the, near, side, of, the, rim, to, the, bottom, brush, the, induced, b, field, increases, the, flux, on, this, side, of, the, circuit, opposing, the, decrease, in, flux, due, to, r, the, rotation, the, energy, required, to, keep, the, disc, moving, despite, this, reactive, force, is, exactly, equal, to, the, electrical, energy, generated, plus, energy, wasted, due, to, friction, joule, heating, and, other, inefficiencies, this, behavior, is, common, to, all, generators, converting, mechanical, energy, to, electrical, energy, when, the, electric, current, in, a, loop, of, wire, changes, the, changing, current, creates, a, changing, magnetic, field, a, second, wire, in, reach, of, this, magnetic, field, will, experience, this, change, in, magnetic, field, as, a, change, in, its, coupled, magnetic, flux, d, b, d, t, displaystyle, frac, d, phi, b, dt, therefore, an, electromotive, force, is, set, up, in, the, second, loop, called, the, induced, emf, or, transformer, emf, if, the, two, ends, of, this, loop, are, connected, through, an, electrical, load, current, will, flow, a, current, clamp, is, a, type, of, transformer, with, a, split, core, which, can, be, spread, apart, and, clipped, onto, a, wire, or, coil, to, either, measure, the, current, in, it, or, in, reverse, to, induce, a, voltage, unlike, conventional, instruments, the, clamp, does, not, make, electrical, contact, with, the, conductor, or, require, it, to, be, disconnected, during, attachment, of, the, clamp, faraday, s, law, is, used, for, measuring, the, flow, of, electrically, conductive, liquids, and, slurries, such, instruments, are, called, magnetic, flow, meters, the, induced, voltage, generated, in, the, magnetic, field, b, due, to, a, conductive, liquid, moving, at, velocity, v, is, thus, given, by, where, is, the, distance, between, electrodes, in, the, magnetic, flow, meter, electrical, conductors, moving, through, a, steady, magnetic, field, or, stationary, conductors, within, a, changing, magnetic, field, will, have, circular, currents, induced, within, them, by, induction, called, eddy, currents, eddy, currents, flow, in, closed, loops, in, planes, perpendicular, to, the, magnetic, field, they, have, useful, applications, in, eddy, current, brakes, and, induction, heating, systems, however, eddy, currents, induced, in, the, metal, magnetic, cores, of, transformers, and, ac, motors, and, generators, are, undesirable, since, they, dissipate, energy, called, core, losses, as, heat, in, the, resistance, of, the, metal, cores, for, these, devices, use, a, number, of, methods, to, reduce, eddy, currents, eddy, currents, occur, when, a, solid, metallic, mass, is, rotated, in, a, magnetic, field, because, the, outer, portion, of, the, metal, cuts, more, magnetic, lines, of, force, than, the, inner, portion, hence, the, induced, electromotive, force, is, not, uniform, this, tends, to, cause, electric, currents, between, the, points, of, greatest, and, least, potential, eddy, currents, consume, a, considerable, amount, of, energy, and, often, cause, a, harmful, rise, in, temperature, only, five, laminations, or, plates, are, shown, in, this, example, so, as, to, show, the, subdivision, of, the, eddy, currents, in, practical, use, the, number, of, laminations, or, punchings, ranges, from, 40, to, 66, per, inch, 16, to, 26, per, centimetre, and, brings, the, eddy, current, loss, down, to, about, one, percent, while, the, plates, can, be, separated, by, insulation, the, voltage, is, so, low, that, the, natural, rust, oxide, coating, of, the, plates, is, enough, to, prevent, current, flow, across, the, laminations, this, is, a, rotor, approximately, 20, mm, in, diameter, from, a, dc, motor, used, in, a, cd, player, note, the, laminations, of, the, electromagnet, pole, pieces, used, to, limit, parasitic, inductive, losses, in, this, illustration, a, solid, copper, bar, conductor, on, a, rotating, armature, is, just, passing, under, the, tip, of, the, pole, piece, n, of, the, field, magnet, note, the, uneven, distribution, of, the, lines, of, force, across, the, copper, bar, the, magnetic, field, is, more, concentrated, and, thus, stronger, on, the, left, edge, of, the, copper, bar, a, b, while, the, field, is, weaker, on, the, right, edge, c, d, since, the, two, edges, of, the, bar, move, with, the, same, velocity, this, difference, in, field, strength, across, the, bar, creates, whorls, or, current, eddies, within, the, copper, bar, high, current, power, frequency, devices, such, as, electric, motors, generators, and, transformers, use, multiple, small, conductors, in, parallel, to, break, up, the, eddy, flows, that, can, form, within, large, solid, conductors, the, same, principle, is, applied, to, transformers, used, at, higher, than, power, frequency, for, example, those, used, in, switch, mode, power, supplies, and, the, intermediate, frequency, coupling, transformers, of, radio, receivers
