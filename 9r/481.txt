sodium, nitrate, is, the, chemical, compound, with, the, formula, na, n, o, 3, this, alkali, metal, nitrate, salt, is, also, known, as, chile, saltpeter, large, deposits, of, which, were, historically, mined, in, chile, to, distinguish, it, from, ordinary, saltpeter, potassium, nitrate, the, mineral, form, is, also, known, as, nitratine, nitratite, or, soda, niter, sodium, nitrate, is, a, white, deliquescent, solid, very, soluble, in, water, it, is, a, readily, available, source, of, the, nitrate, anion, no, 3, which, is, useful, in, several, reactions, carried, out, on, industrial, scales, for, the, production, of, fertilizers, pyrotechnics, smoke, bombs, and, other, explosives, glass, and, pottery, enamels, food, preservatives, esp, meats, and, solid, rocket, propellant, it, has, been, mined, extensively, for, these, purposes, the, first, shipment, of, saltpeter, to, europe, arrived, in, england, from, peru, in, 1820, or, 1825, right, after, that, country, s, independence, from, spain, but, did, not, find, any, buyers, and, was, dumped, at, sea, in, order, to, avoid, customs, toll, with, time, however, the, mining, of, south, american, saltpeter, became, a, profitable, business, in, 1859, england, alone, consumed, 47, 000, metric, tons, chile, fought, the, war, of, the, pacific, 1879, 1884, against, the, allies, peru, and, bolivia, and, took, over, their, richest, deposits, of, saltpeter, in, 1919, ralph, walter, graystone, wyckoff, determined, its, crystal, structure, using, x, ray, crystallography, the, largest, accumulations, of, naturally, occurring, sodium, nitrate, are, found, in, chile, and, peru, where, nitrate, salts, are, bound, within, mineral, deposits, called, caliche, ore, nitrates, accumulate, on, land, through, marine, fog, precipitation, and, sea, spray, oxidation, desiccation, followed, by, gravitational, settling, of, airborne, nano, 3, kno, 3, nacl, na, 2, so, 4, and, i, in, the, hot, dry, desert, atmosphere, el, ni, o, la, ni, a, extreme, aridity, torrential, rain, cycles, favor, nitrates, accumulation, through, both, aridity, and, water, solution, remobilization, transportation, onto, slopes, and, into, basins, capillary, solution, movement, forms, layers, of, nitrates, pure, nitrate, forms, rare, veins, for, more, than, a, century, the, world, supply, of, the, compound, was, mined, almost, exclusively, from, the, atacama, desert, in, northern, chile, until, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, german, chemists, fritz, haber, and, carl, bosch, developed, a, process, for, producing, ammonia, from, the, atmosphere, on, an, industrial, scale, see, haber, process, with, the, onset, of, world, war, i, germany, began, converting, ammonia, from, this, process, into, a, synthetic, chilean, saltpeter, which, was, as, practical, as, the, natural, compound, in, production, of, gunpowder, and, other, munitions, by, the, 1940s, this, conversion, process, resulted, in, a, dramatic, decline, in, demand, for, sodium, nitrate, procured, from, natural, sources, chile, still, has, the, largest, reserves, of, caliche, with, active, mines, in, such, locations, as, valdivia, mar, a, elena, and, pampa, blanca, and, there, it, used, to, be, called, white, gold, sodium, nitrate, potassium, nitrate, sodium, sulfate, and, iodine, are, all, obtained, by, the, processing, of, caliche, the, former, chilean, saltpeter, mining, communities, of, humberstone, and, santa, laura, were, declared, unesco, world, heritage, sites, in, 2005, sodium, nitrate, is, also, synthesized, industrially, by, neutralizing, nitric, acid, with, sodium, carbonate, or, sodium, bicarbonate, or, also, by, neutralizing, it, with, sodium, hydroxide, however, this, reaction, is, very, exothermic, or, by, mixing, stoichiometric, amounts, of, ammonium, nitrate, and, sodium, hydroxide, sodium, bicarbonate, or, sodium, carbonate, most, sodium, nitrate, is, used, in, fertilizers, where, it, supplies, a, water, soluble, form, of, nitrogen, its, use, which, is, mainly, outside, of, high, income, countries, is, attractive, since, it, does, not, alter, the, ph, of, the, soil, another, major, use, is, as, a, complement, to, ammonium, nitrate, in, explosives, molten, sodium, nitrate, and, its, solutions, with, potassium, nitrate, have, good, thermal, stability, up, to, 600, c, and, high, heat, capacities, these, properties, are, suitable, for, thermally, annealing, metals, and, for, storing, thermal, energy, in, solar, applications, sodium, nitrate, is, also, a, food, additive, used, as, a, preservative, and, color, fixative, in, cured, meats, and, poultry, it, is, listed, under, its, ins, number, 251, or, e, number, e251, it, is, approved, for, use, in, the, eu, us, and, australia, and, new, zealand, sodium, nitrate, should, not, be, confused, with, sodium, nitrite, which, is, also, a, common, food, additive, and, preservative, used, for, example, in, deli, meats, sodium, nitrate, has, also, been, investigated, as, a, phase, change, material, for, thermal, energy, recovery, owing, to, its, relatively, high, melting, enthalpy, of, 178, j, g, examples, of, the, applications, of, sodium, nitrate, used, for, thermal, energy, storage, include, solar, thermal, power, technologies, and, direct, steam, generating, parabolic, troughs, sodium, nitrate, is, used, in, a, steel, coating, process, in, which, it, forms, a, surface, of, magnetite, layer, studies, have, shown, a, link, between, increased, levels, of, nitrates, and, increased, deaths, from, certain, diseases, including, alzheimer, s, disease, diabetes, mellitus, stomach, cancer, and, parkinson, s, disease, possibly, through, the, damaging, effect, of, nitrosamines, on, dna, however, little, has, been, done, to, control, for, other, possible, causes, in, the, epidemiological, results, nitrosamines, formed, in, cured, meats, containing, sodium, nitrate, and, nitrite, have, been, linked, to, gastric, cancer, and, esophageal, cancer, sodium, nitrate, and, nitrite, are, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, substantial, evidence, in, recent, decades, facilitated, by, an, increased, understanding, of, pathological, processes, and, science, exists, in, support, of, the, theory, that, processed, meat, increases, the, risk, of, colon, cancer, and, that, this, is, due, to, the, nitrate, content, a, small, amount, of, the, nitrate, added, to, meat, as, a, preservative, breaks, down, into, nitrite, in, addition, to, any, nitrite, that, may, also, be, added, the, nitrite, then, reacts, with, protein, rich, foods, such, as, meat, to, produce, carcinogenic, nocs, nitroso, compounds, nocs, can, be, formed, either, when, meat, is, cured, or, in, the, body, as, meat, is, digested, however, several, things, complicate, the, otherwise, straightforward, understanding, that, nitrates, in, food, raise, the, risk, of, cancer, processed, meats, have, no, fiber, vitamins, or, phytochemical, antioxidants, are, high, in, sodium, may, contain, high, fat, and, are, often, fried, or, cooked, at, a, temperature, sufficient, to, degrade, protein, into, nitrosamines, nitrates, are, key, intermediates, and, effectors, in, the, primary, vasculature, signaling, which, is, necessary, for, all, mammals, to, survive
