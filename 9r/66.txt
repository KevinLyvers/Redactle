the, hertz, symbol, hz, is, the, unit, of, frequency, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, often, described, as, being, equivalent, to, one, event, or, cycle, per, second, the, hertz, is, an, si, derived, unit, whose, formal, expression, in, terms, of, si, base, units, is, s, 1, meaning, that, one, hertz, is, one, per, second, or, the, reciprocal, of, one, second, it, is, used, only, in, the, case, of, periodic, events, it, is, named, after, heinrich, rudolf, hertz, 1857, 1894, the, first, person, to, provide, conclusive, proof, of, the, existence, of, electromagnetic, waves, for, high, frequencies, the, unit, is, commonly, expressed, in, multiples, kilohertz, khz, megahertz, mhz, gigahertz, ghz, terahertz, thz, some, of, the, unit, s, most, common, uses, are, in, the, description, of, periodic, waveforms, and, musical, tones, particularly, those, used, in, radio, and, audio, related, applications, it, is, also, used, to, describe, the, clock, speeds, at, which, computers, and, other, electronics, are, driven, the, units, are, sometimes, also, used, as, a, representation, of, the, energy, of, a, photon, via, the, planck, relation, e, h, where, e, is, the, photon, s, energy, is, its, frequency, and, h, is, the, planck, constant, the, hertz, is, defined, as, one, per, second, for, periodic, events, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, defined, the, second, as, the, duration, of, 9, 192, 631, 770, periods, of, the, radiation, corresponding, to, the, transition, between, the, two, hyperfine, levels, of, the, ground, state, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, and, then, adds, it, follows, that, the, hyperfine, splitting, in, the, ground, state, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, is, exactly, 9, 192, 631, 770, hertz, hfs, cs, 9, 192, 631, 770, hz, the, dimension, of, the, unit, hertz, is, 1, time, t, 1, expressed, in, base, si, units, the, unit, is, the, reciprocal, second, 1, s, in, english, hertz, is, also, used, as, the, plural, form, as, an, si, unit, hz, can, be, prefixed, commonly, used, multiples, are, khz, kilohertz, 10, 3, hz, mhz, megahertz, 10, 6, hz, ghz, gigahertz, 10, 9, hz, and, thz, terahertz, 10, 12, hz, one, hertz, i, e, one, per, second, simply, means, one, periodic, event, occurs, per, second, where, the, event, being, counted, may, be, a, complete, cycle, 100, hz, means, one, hundred, periodic, events, occur, per, second, and, so, on, the, unit, may, be, applied, to, any, periodic, event, for, example, a, clock, might, be, said, to, tick, at, 1, hz, or, a, human, heart, might, be, said, to, beat, at, 1, 2, hz, the, occurrence, rate, of, aperiodic, or, stochastic, events, is, expressed, in, reciprocal, second, or, inverse, second, 1, s, or, s, 1, in, general, or, in, the, specific, case, of, radioactivity, in, becquerels, whereas, 1, hz, one, per, second, specifically, refers, to, one, cycle, or, periodic, event, per, second, 1, bq, also, one, per, second, specifically, refers, to, one, radionuclide, event, per, second, on, average, even, though, frequency, angular, velocity, angular, frequency, and, radioactivity, all, have, the, dimension, t, 1, of, these, only, frequency, is, expressed, using, the, unit, hertz, thus, a, disc, rotating, at, 60, revolutions, per, minute, rpm, is, said, to, have, an, angular, velocity, of, 2, rad, s, and, a, frequency, of, rotation, of, 1, hz, the, correspondence, between, a, frequency, f, with, the, unit, hertz, and, an, angular, velocity, with, the, unit, radians, per, second, is, the, hertz, is, named, after, heinrich, hertz, as, with, every, si, unit, named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, hz, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, hertz, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, the, hertz, is, named, after, the, german, physicist, heinrich, hertz, 1857, 1894, who, made, important, scientific, contributions, to, the, study, of, electromagnetism, the, name, was, established, by, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, in, 1935, it, was, adopted, by, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, in, 1960, replacing, the, previous, name, for, the, unit, cycles, per, second, cps, along, with, its, related, multiples, primarily, kilocycles, per, second, kc, s, and, megacycles, per, second, mc, s, and, occasionally, kilomegacycles, per, second, kmc, s, the, term, cycles, per, second, was, largely, replaced, by, hertz, by, the, 1970s, in, some, usage, the, per, second, was, omitted, so, that, megacycles, mc, was, used, as, an, abbreviation, of, megacycles, per, second, that, is, megahertz, mhz, sound, is, a, traveling, longitudinal, wave, which, is, an, oscillation, of, pressure, humans, perceive, the, frequency, of, a, sound, as, its, pitch, each, musical, note, corresponds, to, a, particular, frequency, an, infant, s, ear, is, able, to, perceive, frequencies, ranging, from, 20, hz, to, 20, 000, hz, the, average, adult, human, can, hear, sounds, between, 20, hz, and, 16, 000, hz, the, range, of, ultrasound, infrasound, and, other, physical, vibrations, such, as, molecular, and, atomic, vibrations, extends, from, a, few, femtohertz, into, the, terahertz, range, and, beyond, electromagnetic, radiation, is, often, described, by, its, frequency, the, number, of, oscillations, of, the, perpendicular, electric, and, magnetic, fields, per, second, expressed, in, hertz, radio, frequency, radiation, is, usually, measured, in, kilohertz, khz, megahertz, mhz, or, gigahertz, ghz, light, is, electromagnetic, radiation, that, is, even, higher, in, frequency, and, has, frequencies, in, the, range, of, tens, infrared, to, thousands, ultraviolet, of, terahertz, electromagnetic, radiation, with, frequencies, in, the, low, terahertz, range, intermediate, between, those, of, the, highest, normally, usable, radio, frequencies, and, long, wave, infrared, light, is, often, called, terahertz, radiation, even, higher, frequencies, exist, such, as, that, of, gamma, rays, which, can, be, measured, in, exahertz, ehz, for, historical, reasons, the, frequencies, of, light, and, higher, frequency, electromagnetic, radiation, are, more, commonly, specified, in, terms, of, their, wavelengths, or, photon, energies, for, a, more, detailed, treatment, of, this, and, the, above, frequency, ranges, see, electromagnetic, spectrum, in, computers, most, central, processing, units, cpu, are, labeled, in, terms, of, their, clock, rate, expressed, in, megahertz, mhz, or, gigahertz, ghz, this, specification, refers, to, the, frequency, of, the, cpu, s, master, clock, signal, this, signal, is, nominally, a, square, wave, which, is, an, electrical, voltage, that, switches, between, low, and, high, logic, levels, at, regular, intervals, as, the, hertz, has, become, the, primary, unit, of, measurement, accepted, by, the, general, populace, to, determine, the, performance, of, a, cpu, many, experts, have, criticized, this, approach, which, they, claim, is, an, easily, manipulable, benchmark, some, processors, use, multiple, clock, cycles, to, perform, a, single, operation, while, others, can, perform, multiple, operations, in, a, single, cycle, for, personal, computers, cpu, clock, speeds, have, ranged, from, approximately, 1, mhz, in, the, late, 1970s, atari, commodore, apple, computers, to, up, to, 6, ghz, in, ibm, power, microprocessors, various, computer, buses, such, as, the, front, side, bus, connecting, the, cpu, and, northbridge, also, operate, at, various, frequencies, in, the, megahertz, range, higher, frequencies, than, the, international, system, of, units, provides, prefixes, for, are, believed, to, occur, naturally, in, the, frequencies, of, the, quantum, mechanical, vibrations, of, massive, particles, although, these, are, not, directly, observable, and, must, be, inferred, through, other, phenomena, by, convention, these, are, typically, not, expressed, in, hertz, but, in, terms, of, the, equivalent, energy, which, is, proportional, to, the, frequency, by, the, factor, of, the, planck, constant, the, cjk, compatibility, block, in, unicode, contains, characters, for, common, si, units, for, frequency, these, are, intended, for, compatibility, with, east, asian, character, encodings, and, not, for, use, in, new, documents, which, would, be, expected, to, use, latin, letters,
