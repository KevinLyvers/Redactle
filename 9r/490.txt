organophosphorus, chemistry, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, synthesis, and, properties, of, organophosphorus, compounds, which, are, organic, compounds, containing, phosphorus, they, are, used, primarily, in, pest, control, as, an, alternative, to, chlorinated, hydrocarbons, that, persist, in, the, environment, some, organophosphorus, compounds, are, highly, effective, insecticides, although, some, are, extremely, toxic, to, humans, including, sarin, and, vx, nerve, agents, phosphorus, like, nitrogen, is, in, group, 15, of, the, periodic, table, and, thus, phosphorus, compounds, and, nitrogen, compounds, have, many, similar, properties, the, definition, of, organophosphorus, compounds, is, variable, which, can, lead, to, confusion, in, industrial, and, environmental, chemistry, an, organophosphorus, compound, need, contain, only, an, organic, substituent, but, need, not, have, a, direct, phosphorus, carbon, p, c, bond, thus, a, large, proportion, of, pesticides, e, g, malathion, are, often, included, in, this, class, of, compounds, phosphorus, can, adopt, a, variety, of, oxidation, states, and, it, is, general, to, classify, organophosphorus, compounds, based, on, their, being, derivatives, of, phosphorus, v, vs, phosphorus, iii, which, are, the, predominant, classes, of, compounds, in, a, descriptive, but, only, intermittently, used, nomenclature, phosphorus, compounds, are, identified, by, their, coordination, number, and, their, valency, in, this, system, a, phosphine, is, a, 3, 3, compound, phosphate, esters, have, the, general, structure, p, o, or, 3, feature, p, v, such, species, are, of, technological, importance, as, flame, retardant, agents, and, plasticizers, lacking, a, p, c, bond, these, compounds, are, in, the, technical, sense, not, organophosphorus, compounds, but, esters, of, phosphoric, acid, many, derivatives, are, found, in, nature, such, as, phosphatidylcholine, phosphate, ester, are, synthesized, by, alcoholysis, of, phosphorus, oxychloride, a, variety, of, mixed, amido, alkoxo, derivatives, are, known, one, medically, significant, example, being, the, anti, cancer, drug, cyclophosphamide, also, derivatives, containing, the, thiophosphoryl, group, p, s, include, the, pesticide, malathion, the, organophosphates, prepared, on, the, largest, scale, are, the, zinc, dithiophosphates, as, additives, for, motor, oil, several, million, kilograms, of, this, coordination, complex, are, produced, annually, by, the, reaction, of, phosphorus, pentasulfide, with, alcohols, in, the, environment, these, compounds, break, down, via, hydrolysis, to, eventually, afford, phosphate, and, the, organic, alcohol, or, amine, from, which, they, are, derived, phosphonates, are, esters, of, phosphonic, acid, and, have, the, general, formula, rp, o, or, 2, phosphonates, have, many, technical, applications, a, well, known, member, being, glyphosate, better, known, as, roundup, with, the, formula, ho, 2, p, o, ch, 2, nhch, 2, co, 2, h, this, derivative, of, glycine, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, herbicides, bisphosphonates, are, a, class, of, drugs, to, treat, osteoporosis, the, nerve, gas, agent, sarin, containing, both, c, p, and, f, p, bonds, is, a, phosphonate, phosphinates, feature, two, p, c, bonds, with, the, general, formula, r, 2, p, o, or, a, commercially, significant, member, is, the, herbicide, glufosinate, similar, to, glyphosate, mentioned, above, it, has, the, structure, ch, 3, p, o, oh, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, nh, 2, co, 2, h, the, michaelis, arbuzov, reaction, is, the, main, method, for, the, synthesis, of, these, compounds, for, example, dimethylmethylphosphonate, see, figure, above, arises, from, the, rearrangement, of, trimethylphosphite, which, is, catalyzed, by, methyl, iodide, in, the, horner, wadsworth, emmons, reaction, and, the, seyferth, gilbert, homologation, phosphonates, are, used, in, reactions, with, carbonyl, compounds, the, kabachnik, fields, reaction, is, a, method, for, the, preparation, of, aminophosphonates, these, compounds, contain, a, very, inert, bond, between, phosphorus, and, carbon, consequently, they, hydrolyze, to, give, phosphonic, and, phosphinic, acid, derivatives, but, not, phosphate, phosphine, oxides, designation, 4, 5, have, the, general, structure, r, 3, p, o, with, formal, oxidation, state, v, phosphine, oxides, form, hydrogen, bonds, and, some, are, therefore, soluble, in, water, the, p, o, bond, is, very, polar, with, a, dipole, moment, of, 4, 51, d, for, triphenylphosphine, oxide, compounds, related, to, phosphine, oxides, include, phosphine, imides, r, 3, pnr, and, related, chalcogenides, r, 3, pe, where, e, s, se, te, these, compounds, are, some, of, the, most, thermally, stable, organophosphorus, compounds, compounds, with, the, formula, x, comprise, the, phosphonium, salts, these, species, are, tetrahedral, phosphorus, v, compounds, from, the, commercial, perspective, the, most, important, member, is, tetrakis, hydroxymethyl, phosphonium, chloride, cl, which, is, used, as, a, fire, retardant, in, textiles, approximately, 2m, kg, are, produced, annually, of, the, chloride, and, the, related, sulfate, they, are, generated, by, the, reaction, of, phosphine, with, formaldehyde, in, the, presence, of, the, mineral, acid, a, variety, of, phosphonium, salts, can, be, prepared, by, alkylation, and, arylation, of, organophosphines, the, methylation, of, triphenylphosphine, is, the, first, step, in, the, preparation, of, the, wittig, reagent, the, parent, phosphorane, 5, 5, is, ph, 5, which, is, unknown, related, compounds, containing, both, halide, and, organic, substituents, on, phosphorus, are, fairly, common, those, with, five, organic, substituents, are, rare, although, p, c, 6, h, 5, 5, is, known, being, derived, from, p, c, 6, h, 5, 4, by, reaction, with, phenyllithium, phosphorus, ylides, are, unsaturated, phosphoranes, known, as, wittig, reagents, e, g, ch, 2, p, c, 6, h, 5, 3, these, compounds, feature, tetrahedral, phosphorus, v, and, are, considered, relatives, of, phosphine, oxides, they, also, are, derived, from, phosphonium, salts, but, by, deprotonation, not, alkylation, phosphites, sometimes, called, phosphite, esters, have, the, general, structure, p, or, 3, with, oxidation, state, 3, such, species, arise, from, the, alcoholysis, of, phosphorus, trichloride, the, reaction, is, general, thus, a, vast, number, of, such, species, are, known, phosphites, are, employed, in, the, perkow, reaction, and, the, michaelis, arbuzov, reaction, they, also, serve, as, ligands, in, organometallic, chemistry, intermediate, between, phosphites, and, phosphines, are, phosphonites, p, or, 2, r, and, phosphinite, p, or, r, 2, such, species, arise, via, alcoholysis, reactions, of, the, corresponding, phosphonous, and, phosphinous, chlorides, pcl, 2, r, and, pclr, 2, respectively, the, latter, are, produced, by, reaction, of, a, phosphorus, trichloride, with, a, poor, metal, alkyl, complex, e, g, organomercury, organolead, or, a, mixed, lithium, organoaluminum, compound, the, parent, compound, of, the, phosphines, is, ph, 3, called, phosphine, in, the, us, and, british, commonwealth, but, phosphane, elsewhere, replacement, of, one, or, more, hydrogen, centers, by, an, organic, substituents, alkyl, aryl, gives, ph, 3, x, r, x, an, organophosphine, generally, referred, to, as, phosphines, from, the, commercial, perspective, the, most, important, phosphine, is, triphenylphosphine, several, million, kilograms, being, produced, annually, it, is, prepared, from, the, reaction, of, chlorobenzene, pcl, 3, and, sodium, phosphines, of, a, more, specialized, nature, are, usually, prepared, by, other, routes, phosphorus, halides, undergo, nucleophilic, displacement, by, organometallic, reagents, such, as, grignard, reagents, organophosphines, are, nucleophiles, and, ligands, two, major, applications, are, as, reagents, in, the, wittig, reaction, and, as, supporting, phosphine, ligands, in, homogeneous, catalysis, their, nucleophilicity, is, evidenced, by, their, reactions, with, alkyl, halides, to, give, phosphonium, salts, phosphines, are, nucleophilic, catalysts, in, organic, synthesis, e, g, the, rauhut, currier, reaction, and, baylis, hillman, reaction, phosphines, are, reducing, agents, as, illustrated, in, the, staudinger, reduction, for, the, conversion, of, organic, azides, to, amines, and, in, the, mitsunobu, reaction, for, converting, alcohols, into, esters, in, these, processes, the, phosphine, is, oxidized, to, phosphorus, v, phosphines, have, also, been, found, to, reduce, activated, carbonyl, groups, for, instance, the, reduction, of, an, keto, ester, to, an, hydroxy, ester, compounds, with, carbon, phosphorus, iii, multiple, bonds, are, called, phosphaalkenes, r, 2, c, pr, and, phosphaalkynes, rc, p, they, are, similar, in, structure, but, not, in, reactivity, to, imines, r, 2, c, nr, and, nitriles, rc, n, respectively, in, the, compound, phosphorine, one, carbon, atom, in, benzene, is, replaced, by, phosphorus, species, of, this, type, are, relatively, rare, but, for, that, reason, are, of, interest, to, researchers, a, general, method, for, the, synthesis, of, phosphaalkenes, is, by, 1, 2, elimination, of, suitable, precursors, initiated, thermally, or, by, base, such, as, dbu, dabco, or, triethylamine, thermolysis, of, me, 2, ph, generates, ch, 2, pme, an, unstable, species, in, the, condensed, phase, compounds, where, phosphorus, exists, in, a, formal, oxidation, state, of, less, than, iii, are, uncommon, but, examples, are, known, for, each, class, organophosphorus, 0, species, are, debatably, illustrated, by, the, carbene, adducts, 2, where, nhc, is, an, n, heterocyclic, carbene, with, the, formulae, rp, n, and, r, 2, p, 2, respectively, compounds, of, phosphorus, i, and, ii, are, generated, by, reduction, of, the, related, organophosphorus, iii, chlorides, diphosphenes, with, the, formula, r, 2, p, 2, formally, contain, phosphorus, phosphorus, double, bonds, these, phosphorus, i, species, are, rare, but, are, stable, provided, that, the, organic, substituents, are, large, enough, to, prevent, catenation, bulky, substituents, also, stabilize, phosphorus, radicals, many, mixed, valence, compounds, are, known, e, g, the, cage, p, 7, ch, 3, 3
