soil, science, is, the, study, of, soil, as, a, natural, resource, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, including, soil, formation, classification, and, mapping, physical, chemical, biological, and, fertility, properties, of, soils, and, these, properties, in, relation, to, the, use, and, management, of, soils, sometimes, terms, which, refer, to, branches, of, soil, science, such, as, pedology, formation, chemistry, morphology, and, classification, of, soil, and, edaphology, how, soils, interact, with, living, things, especially, plants, are, used, as, if, synonymous, with, soil, science, the, diversity, of, names, associated, with, this, discipline, is, related, to, the, various, associations, concerned, indeed, engineers, agronomists, chemists, geologists, physical, geographers, ecologists, biologists, microbiologists, silviculturists, sanitarians, archaeologists, and, specialists, in, regional, planning, all, contribute, to, further, knowledge, of, soils, and, the, advancement, of, the, soil, sciences, soil, scientists, have, raised, concerns, about, how, to, preserve, soil, and, arable, land, in, a, world, with, a, growing, population, possible, future, water, crisis, increasing, per, capita, food, consumption, and, land, degradation, soil, occupies, the, pedosphere, one, of, earth, s, spheres, that, the, geosciences, use, to, organize, the, earth, conceptually, this, is, the, conceptual, perspective, of, pedology, and, edaphology, the, two, main, branches, of, soil, science, pedology, is, the, study, of, soil, in, its, natural, setting, edaphology, is, the, study, of, soil, in, relation, to, soil, dependent, uses, both, branches, apply, a, combination, of, soil, physics, soil, chemistry, and, soil, biology, due, to, the, numerous, interactions, between, the, biosphere, atmosphere, and, hydrosphere, that, are, hosted, within, the, pedosphere, more, integrated, less, soil, centric, concepts, are, also, valuable, many, concepts, essential, to, understanding, soil, come, from, individuals, not, identifiable, strictly, as, soil, scientists, this, highlights, the, interdisciplinary, nature, of, soil, concepts, exploring, the, diversity, and, dynamics, of, soil, continues, to, yield, fresh, discoveries, and, insights, new, avenues, of, soil, research, are, compelled, by, a, need, to, understand, soil, in, the, context, of, climate, change, greenhouse, gases, and, carbon, sequestration, interest, in, maintaining, the, planet, s, biodiversity, and, in, exploring, past, cultures, has, also, stimulated, renewed, interest, in, achieving, a, more, refined, understanding, of, soil, in, 1998, the, world, reference, base, for, soil, resources, wrb, replaced, the, fao, soil, classification, as, the, international, soil, classification, system, the, currently, valid, version, of, wrb, is, the, 4th, edition, 2022, the, fao, soil, classification, in, turn, borrowed, from, modern, soil, classification, concepts, including, usda, soil, taxonomy, wrb, is, based, mainly, on, soil, morphology, as, an, expression, of, pedogenesis, a, major, difference, with, usda, soil, taxonomy, is, that, soil, climate, is, not, part, of, the, system, except, insofar, as, climate, influences, soil, profile, characteristics, many, other, classification, schemes, exist, including, vernacular, systems, the, structure, in, vernacular, systems, is, either, nominal, giving, unique, names, to, soils, or, landscapes, or, descriptive, naming, soils, by, their, characteristics, such, as, red, hot, fat, or, sandy, soils, are, distinguished, by, obvious, characteristics, such, as, physical, appearance, e, g, color, texture, landscape, position, performance, e, g, production, capability, flooding, and, accompanying, vegetation, a, vernacular, distinction, familiar, to, many, is, classifying, texture, as, heavy, or, light, light, soil, content, and, better, structure, take, less, effort, to, turn, and, cultivate, light, soils, do, not, necessarily, weigh, less, than, heavy, soils, on, an, air, dry, basis, nor, do, they, have, more, porosity, the, earliest, known, soil, classification, system, comes, from, china, appearing, in, the, book, yu, gong, 5th, century, bce, where, the, soil, was, divided, into, three, categories, and, nine, classes, depending, on, its, color, texture, and, hydrology, contemporaries, friedrich, albert, fallou, the, german, founder, of, modern, soil, science, and, vasily, dokuchaev, the, russian, founder, of, modern, soil, science, are, both, credited, with, being, among, the, first, to, identify, soil, as, a, resource, whose, distinctness, and, complexity, deserved, to, be, separated, conceptually, from, geology, and, crop, production, and, treated, as, a, whole, as, a, founding, father, of, soil, science, fallou, has, primacy, in, time, fallou, was, working, on, the, origins, of, soil, before, dokuchaev, was, born, however, dokuchaev, s, work, was, more, extensive, and, is, considered, to, be, the, more, significant, to, modern, soil, theory, than, fallou, s, previously, soil, had, been, considered, a, product, of, chemical, transformations, of, rocks, a, dead, substrate, from, which, plants, derive, nutritious, elements, soil, and, bedrock, were, in, fact, equated, dokuchaev, considers, the, soil, as, a, natural, body, having, its, own, genesis, and, its, own, history, of, development, a, body, with, complex, and, multiform, processes, taking, place, within, it, the, soil, is, considered, as, different, from, bedrock, the, latter, becomes, soil, under, the, influence, of, a, series, of, soil, formation, factors, climate, vegetation, country, relief, and, age, according, to, him, soil, should, be, called, the, daily, or, outward, horizons, of, rocks, regardless, of, the, type, they, are, changed, naturally, by, the, common, effect, of, water, air, and, various, kinds, of, living, and, dead, organisms, a, 1914, encyclopedic, definition, the, different, forms, of, earth, on, the, surface, of, the, rocks, formed, by, the, breaking, down, or, weathering, of, rocks, serves, to, illustrate, the, historic, view, of, soil, which, persisted, from, the, 19th, century, dokuchaev, s, late, 19th, century, soil, concept, developed, in, the, 20th, century, to, one, of, soil, as, earthy, material, that, has, been, altered, by, living, processes, a, corollary, concept, is, that, soil, without, a, living, component, is, simply, a, part, of, earth, s, outer, layer, further, refinement, of, the, soil, concept, is, occurring, in, view, of, an, appreciation, of, energy, transport, and, transformation, within, soil, the, term, is, popularly, applied, to, the, material, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, s, moon, and, mars, a, usage, acceptable, within, a, portion, of, the, scientific, community, accurate, to, this, modern, understanding, of, soil, is, nikiforoff, s, 1959, definition, of, soil, as, the, excited, skin, of, the, sub, aerial, part, of, the, earth, s, crust, academically, soil, scientists, tend, to, be, drawn, to, one, of, five, areas, of, specialization, microbiology, pedology, edaphology, physics, or, chemistry, yet, the, work, specifics, are, very, much, dictated, by, the, challenges, facing, our, civilization, s, desire, to, sustain, the, land, that, supports, it, and, the, distinctions, between, the, sub, disciplines, of, soil, science, often, blur, in, the, process, soil, science, professionals, commonly, stay, current, in, soil, chemistry, soil, physics, soil, microbiology, pedology, and, applied, soil, science, in, related, disciplines, one, interesting, effort, drawing, in, soil, scientists, in, the, u, s, as, of, 2004, is, the, soil, quality, initiative, central, to, the, soil, quality, initiative, is, developing, indices, of, soil, health, and, then, monitoring, them, in, a, way, that, gives, us, long, term, decade, to, decade, feedback, on, our, performance, as, stewards, of, the, planet, the, effort, includes, understanding, the, functions, of, soil, microbiotic, crusts, and, exploring, the, potential, to, sequester, atmospheric, carbon, in, soil, organic, matter, the, concept, of, agriculture, in, relation, to, soil, quality, however, has, not, been, without, its, share, of, controversy, and, criticism, including, critiques, by, nobel, laureate, norman, borlaug, and, world, food, prize, winner, pedro, sanchez, a, more, traditional, role, for, soil, scientists, has, been, to, map, soils, most, every, area, in, the, united, states, now, has, a, published, soil, survey, which, includes, interpretive, tables, as, to, how, soil, properties, support, or, limit, activities, and, uses, an, internationally, accepted, soil, taxonomy, allows, uniform, communication, of, soil, characteristics, and, soil, functions, national, and, international, soil, survey, efforts, have, given, the, profession, unique, insights, into, landscape, scale, functions, the, landscape, functions, that, soil, scientists, are, called, upon, to, address, in, the, field, seem, to, fall, roughly, into, six, areas, there, are, also, practical, applications, of, soil, science, that, might, not, be, apparent, from, looking, at, a, published, soil, survey, depression, storage, capacity, in, soil, science, is, the, ability, of, a, particular, area, of, land, to, retain, water, in, its, pits, and, depressions, thus, preventing, it, from, flowing, depression, storage, capacity, along, with, infiltration, capacity, is, one, of, the, main, factors, involved, in, horton, overland, flow, whereby, water, volume, surpasses, both, infiltration, and, depression, storage, capacity, and, begins, to, flow, horizontally, across, land, possibly, leading, to, flooding, and, soil, erosion, the, study, of, land, s, depression, storage, capacity, is, important, in, the, fields, of, geology, ecology, and, especially, hydrology
