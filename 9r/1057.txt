in, particle, physics, the, w, and, z, bosons, are, vector, bosons, that, are, together, known, as, the, weak, bosons, or, more, generally, as, the, intermediate, vector, bosons, these, elementary, particles, mediate, the, weak, interaction, the, respective, symbols, are, w, w, and, z, 0, the, w, bosons, have, either, a, positive, or, negative, electric, charge, of, 1, elementary, charge, and, are, each, other, s, antiparticles, the, z, 0, boson, is, electrically, neutral, and, is, its, own, antiparticle, the, three, particles, each, have, a, spin, of, 1, the, w, bosons, have, a, magnetic, moment, but, the, z, 0, has, none, all, three, of, these, particles, are, very, short, lived, with, a, half, life, of, about, 3, 10, 25, s, their, experimental, discovery, was, pivotal, in, establishing, what, is, now, called, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, the, w, bosons, are, named, after, the, weak, force, the, physicist, steven, weinberg, named, the, additional, particle, the, z, particle, and, later, gave, the, explanation, that, it, was, the, last, additional, particle, needed, by, the, model, the, w, bosons, had, already, been, named, and, the, z, bosons, were, named, for, having, zero, electric, charge, the, two, w, bosons, are, verified, mediators, of, neutrino, absorption, and, emission, during, these, processes, the, w, boson, charge, induces, electron, or, positron, emission, or, absorption, thus, causing, nuclear, transmutation, the, z, boson, mediates, the, transfer, of, momentum, spin, and, energy, when, neutrinos, scatter, elastically, from, matter, a, process, which, conserves, charge, such, behavior, is, almost, as, common, as, inelastic, neutrino, interactions, and, may, be, observed, in, bubble, chambers, upon, irradiation, with, neutrino, beams, the, z, boson, is, not, involved, in, the, absorption, or, emission, of, electrons, or, positrons, whenever, an, electron, is, observed, as, a, new, free, particle, suddenly, moving, with, kinetic, energy, it, is, inferred, to, be, a, result, of, a, neutrino, interacting, with, the, electron, with, the, momentum, transfer, via, the, z, boson, since, this, behavior, happens, more, often, when, the, neutrino, beam, is, present, in, this, process, the, neutrino, simply, strikes, the, electron, via, exchange, of, a, boson, and, then, scatters, away, from, it, transferring, some, of, the, neutrino, s, momentum, to, the, electron, these, bosons, are, among, the, heavyweights, of, the, elementary, particles, with, masses, of, 80, 4, gev, c, 2, and, 91, 2, gev, c, 2, respectively, the, w, and, z, bosons, are, almost, 80, times, as, massive, as, the, proton, heavier, even, than, entire, iron, atoms, their, high, masses, limit, the, range, of, the, weak, interaction, by, way, of, contrast, the, photon, is, the, force, carrier, of, the, electromagnetic, force, and, has, zero, mass, consistent, with, the, infinite, range, of, electromagnetism, the, hypothetical, graviton, is, also, expected, to, have, zero, mass, although, gluons, are, also, presumed, to, have, zero, mass, the, range, of, the, strong, nuclear, force, is, limited, for, different, reasons, see, color, confinement, all, three, bosons, have, particle, spin, s, 1, the, emission, of, a, w, or, w, boson, either, lowers, or, raises, the, electric, charge, of, the, emitting, particle, by, one, unit, and, also, alters, the, spin, by, one, unit, at, the, same, time, the, emission, or, absorption, of, a, w, boson, can, change, the, type, of, the, particle, for, example, changing, a, strange, quark, into, an, up, quark, the, neutral, z, boson, cannot, change, the, electric, charge, of, any, particle, nor, can, it, change, any, other, of, the, so, called, charges, such, as, strangeness, baryon, number, charm, etc, the, emission, or, absorption, of, a, z, 0, boson, can, only, change, the, spin, momentum, and, energy, of, the, other, particle, see, also, weak, neutral, current, the, w, and, z, bosons, are, carrier, particles, that, mediate, the, weak, nuclear, force, much, as, the, photon, is, the, carrier, particle, for, the, electromagnetic, force, the, w, bosons, are, best, known, for, their, role, in, nuclear, decay, consider, for, example, the, beta, decay, of, cobalt, 60, this, reaction, does, not, involve, the, whole, cobalt, 60, nucleus, but, affects, only, one, of, its, 33, neutrons, the, neutron, is, converted, into, a, proton, while, also, emitting, an, electron, often, called, a, beta, particle, in, this, context, and, an, electron, antineutrino, again, the, neutron, is, not, an, elementary, particle, but, a, composite, of, an, up, quark, and, two, down, quarks, u, d, d, it, is, one, of, the, down, quarks, that, interacts, in, beta, decay, turning, into, an, up, quark, to, form, a, proton, u, u, d, at, the, most, fundamental, level, then, the, weak, force, changes, the, flavour, of, a, single, quark, which, is, immediately, followed, by, decay, of, the, w, itself, the, z, 0, boson, is, its, own, antiparticle, thus, all, of, its, flavour, quantum, numbers, and, charges, are, zero, the, exchange, of, a, z, boson, between, particles, called, a, neutral, current, interaction, therefore, leaves, the, interacting, particles, unaffected, except, for, a, transfer, of, spin, and, or, momentum, z, boson, interactions, involving, neutrinos, have, distinct, signatures, they, provide, the, only, known, mechanism, for, elastic, scattering, of, neutrinos, in, matter, neutrinos, are, almost, as, likely, to, scatter, elastically, via, z, boson, exchange, as, inelastically, via, w, boson, exchange, weak, neutral, currents, via, z, boson, exchange, were, confirmed, shortly, thereafter, also, in, 1973, in, a, neutrino, experiment, in, the, gargamelle, bubble, chamber, at, cern, following, the, success, of, quantum, electrodynamics, in, the, 1950s, attempts, were, undertaken, to, formulate, a, similar, theory, of, the, weak, nuclear, force, this, culminated, around, 1968, in, a, unified, theory, of, electromagnetism, and, weak, interactions, by, sheldon, glashow, steven, weinberg, and, abdus, salam, for, which, they, shared, the, 1979, nobel, prize, in, physics, their, electroweak, theory, postulated, not, only, the, w, bosons, necessary, to, explain, beta, decay, but, also, a, new, z, boson, that, had, never, been, observed, the, fact, that, the, w, and, z, bosons, have, mass, while, photons, are, massless, was, a, major, obstacle, in, developing, electroweak, theory, these, particles, are, accurately, described, by, an, su, 2, gauge, theory, but, the, bosons, in, a, gauge, theory, must, be, massless, as, a, case, in, point, the, photon, is, massless, because, electromagnetism, is, described, by, a, u, 1, gauge, theory, some, mechanism, is, required, to, break, the, su, 2, symmetry, giving, mass, to, the, w, and, z, in, the, process, the, higgs, mechanism, first, put, forward, by, the, 1964, prl, symmetry, breaking, papers, fulfills, this, role, it, requires, the, existence, of, another, particle, the, higgs, boson, which, has, since, been, found, at, the, large, hadron, collider, of, the, four, components, of, a, goldstone, boson, created, by, the, higgs, field, three, are, absorbed, by, the, w, z, 0, and, w, bosons, to, form, their, longitudinal, components, and, the, remainder, appears, as, the, spin, 0, higgs, boson, the, combination, of, the, su, 2, gauge, theory, of, the, weak, interaction, the, electromagnetic, interaction, and, the, higgs, mechanism, is, known, as, the, glashow, weinberg, salam, model, today, it, is, widely, accepted, as, one, of, the, pillars, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, particularly, given, the, 2012, discovery, of, the, higgs, boson, by, the, cms, and, atlas, experiments, the, model, predicts, that, w, and, z, 0, bosons, have, the, following, masses, where, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, su, 2, gauge, coupling, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, u, 1, gauge, coupling, and, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, higgs, vacuum, expectation, value, unlike, beta, decay, the, observation, of, neutral, current, interactions, that, involve, particles, other, than, neutrinos, requires, huge, investments, in, particle, accelerators, and, particle, detectors, such, as, are, available, in, only, a, few, high, energy, physics, laboratories, in, the, world, and, then, only, after, 1983, this, is, because, z, bosons, behave, in, somewhat, the, same, manner, as, photons, but, do, not, become, important, until, the, energy, of, the, interaction, is, comparable, with, the, relatively, huge, mass, of, the, z, boson, the, discovery, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, was, considered, a, major, success, for, cern, first, in, 1973, came, the, observation, of, neutral, current, interactions, as, predicted, by, electroweak, theory, the, huge, gargamelle, bubble, chamber, photographed, the, tracks, produced, by, neutrino, interactions, and, observed, events, where, a, neutrino, interacted, but, did, not, produce, a, corresponding, lepton, this, is, a, hallmark, of, a, neutral, current, interaction, and, is, interpreted, as, a, neutrino, exchanging, an, unseen, z, boson, with, a, proton, or, neutron, in, the, bubble, chamber, the, neutrino, is, otherwise, undetectable, so, the, only, observable, effect, is, the, momentum, imparted, to, the, proton, or, neutron, by, the, interaction, the, discovery, of, the, w, and, z, bosons, themselves, had, to, wait, for, the, construction, of, a, particle, accelerator, powerful, enough, to, produce, them, the, first, such, machine, that, became, available, was, the, super, proton, synchrotron, where, unambiguous, signals, of, w, bosons, were, seen, in, january, 1983, during, a, series, of, experiments, made, possible, by, carlo, rubbia, and, simon, van, der, meer, the, actual, experiments, were, called, ua1, led, by, rubbia, and, ua2, led, by, pierre, darriulat, and, were, the, collaborative, effort, of, many, people, van, der, meer, was, the, driving, force, on, the, accelerator, end, stochastic, cooling, ua1, and, ua2, found, the, z, boson, a, few, months, later, in, may, 1983, rubbia, and, van, der, meer, were, promptly, awarded, the, 1984, nobel, prize, in, physics, a, most, unusual, step, for, the, conservative, nobel, foundation, the, w, w, and, z, 0, bosons, together, with, the, photon, comprise, the, four, gauge, bosons, of, the, electroweak, interaction, before, 2022, measurements, of, the, w, boson, mass, appeared, to, be, consistent, with, the, standard, model, for, example, in, 2021, experimental, measurements, of, the, w, boson, mass, were, assessed, to, converge, around, 80, 379, 12, mev, however, in, april, 2022, a, new, analysis, of, data, that, was, obtained, by, the, fermilab, tevatron, collider, before, its, closure, in, 2011, determined, the, mass, of, the, w, boson, to, be, 80, 433, 9, mev, which, is, seven, standard, deviations, above, that, predicted, by, the, standard, model, meaning, that, if, the, model, is, correct, there, should, only, be, a, one, trillionth, chance, that, such, a, large, mass, would, arise, by, non, systematic, observational, error, according, to, ashutosh, kotwal, of, duke, university, and, the, leader, of, the, collider, detector, at, fermilab, collaboration, the, lower, beam, luminosity, used, reduced, the, chance, that, events, of, interest, would, be, obscured, by, other, collisions, and, that, the, use, of, proton, antiproton, collisions, simplifies, the, process, of, quark, antiquark, annihilation, which, then, decayed, to, give, a, lepton, and, a, neutrino, the, team, deliberately, encrypted, its, data, and, withheld, any, preliminary, results, from, themselves, until, the, analysis, was, complete, to, prevent, confirmation, bias, bending, their, interpretation, of, the, data, kotwal, described, it, as, the, largest, crack, in, this, beautiful, theory, speculating, that, it, might, be, the, first, clear, evidence, of, other, forces, or, particles, not, accounted, for, by, the, standard, model, and, which, might, be, accounted, for, by, theories, such, as, supersymmetry, the, nobel, winning, theoretical, physicist, frank, wilczek, described, the, result, as, a, monumental, piece, of, work, besides, being, inconsistent, with, the, standard, model, the, new, measurement, is, also, inconsistent, with, previous, measurements, such, as, atlas, this, suggests, that, either, the, old, or, the, new, measurements, despite, all, precautions, have, an, unexpected, systematic, error, such, as, an, undetected, quirk, in, the, equipment, future, experiments, with, the, lhc, may, help, determine, which, set, of, measurements, if, either, are, the, correct, ones, fermilab, deputy, director, joseph, lykken, reiterated, that, the, new, measurement, needs, to, be, confirmed, by, another, experiment, before, it, can, be, interpreted, fully, matthias, schott, of, the, university, of, mainz, commented, that, i, do, not, think, we, have, to, discuss, which, new, physics, could, explain, the, discrepancy, between, cdf, and, the, standard, model, we, first, have, to, understand, why, the, cdf, measurement, is, in, strong, tension, with, all, in, 2023, the, atlas, experiment, released, an, improved, measurement, for, the, mass, of, the, w, boson, 80, 360, 16, mev, which, aligned, with, predictions, from, the, standard, model, the, combination, of, all, measurements, of, the, w, boson, mass, excluding, the, measurement, from, cdf, yields, a, value, of, 80369, 2, 13, 3, mev, c, which, deviates, from, the, cdf, measurement, with, a, significance, of, 3, 6, the, w, and, z, bosons, decay, to, fermion, pairs, but, neither, the, w, nor, the, z, bosons, have, sufficient, energy, to, decay, into, the, highest, mass, top, quark, neglecting, phase, space, effects, and, higher, order, corrections, simple, estimates, of, their, branching, fractions, can, be, calculated, from, the, coupling, constants, w, bosons, can, decay, to, a, lepton, and, antilepton, one, of, them, charged, and, another, neutral, or, to, a, quark, and, antiquark, of, complementary, types, with, opposite, electric, charges, 1, 3, and, 2, 3, the, decay, width, of, the, w, boson, to, a, quark, antiquark, pair, is, proportional, to, the, corresponding, squared, ckm, matrix, element, and, the, number, of, quark, colours, n, c, 3, the, decay, widths, for, the, w, boson, are, then, proportional, to, here, e, denote, the, three, flavours, of, leptons, more, exactly, the, positive, charged, antileptons, e, denote, the, three, flavours, of, neutrinos, the, other, particles, starting, with, u, and, d, all, denote, quarks, and, antiquarks, factor, n, c, is, applied, the, various, v, i, j, displaystyle, v, ij, denote, the, corresponding, ckm, matrix, coefficients, unitarity, of, the, ckm, matrix, implies,

thus, each, of, two, quark, rows, sums, to, 3, therefore, the, leptonic, branching, ratios, of, the, w, boson, are, approximately, b, e, e, displaystyle, b, mathrm, e, mathrm, nu, mathrm, e, b,

c, s, final, states, the, sum, of, the, hadronic, branching, ratios, has, been, measured, experimentally, to, be, 67, 60, 0, 27, with, b, displaystyle, b, ell, mathrm, nu, ell, 10, 80, 0, 09, z, bosons, decay, into, a, fermion, and, its, antiparticle, as, the, z, 0, boson, is, a, mixture, of, the, pre, symmetry, breaking, w, 0, and, b, 0, bosons, see, weak, mixing, angle, each, vertex, factor, includes, a, factor, t, 3, q, sin, 2, w, displaystyle, t, 3, q, sin, 2, theta, mathsf, w, where, t, 3, displaystyle, t, 3, is, the, third, component, of, the, weak, isospin, of, the, fermion, the, charge, for, the, weak, force, q, displaystyle, q, is, the, electric, charge, of, the, fermion, in, units, of, the, elementary, charge, and, w, displaystyle, theta, mathsf, w, is, the, weak, mixing, angle, because, the, weak, isospin, t, 3, displaystyle, t, 3, is, different, for, fermions, of, different, chirality, either, left, handed, or, right, handed, the, coupling, is, different, as, well, the, relative, strengths, of, each, coupling, can, be, estimated, by, considering, that, the, decay, rates, include, the, square, of, these, factors, and, all, possible, diagrams, e, g, sum, over, quark, families, and, left, and, right, contributions, the, results, tabulated, below, are, just, estimates, since, they, only, include, tree, level, interaction, diagrams, in, the, fermi, theory, in, 2018, the, cms, collaboration, observed, the, first, exclusive, decay, of, the, z, boson, to, a, meson, and, a, lepton, antilepton, pair
