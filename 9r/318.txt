in, chemistry, a, hydrogen, bond, or, h, bond, is, primarily, an, electrostatic, force, of, attraction, between, a, hydrogen, h, atom, which, is, covalently, bonded, to, a, more, electronegative, donor, atom, or, group, dn, and, another, electronegative, atom, bearing, a, lone, pair, of, electrons, the, hydrogen, bond, acceptor, ac, such, an, interacting, system, is, generally, denoted, dn, h, ac, where, the, solid, line, denotes, a, polar, covalent, bond, and, the, dotted, or, dashed, line, indicates, the, hydrogen, bond, the, most, frequent, donor, and, acceptor, atoms, are, the, period, 2, elements, nitrogen, n, oxygen, o, and, fluorine, f, hydrogen, bonds, can, be, intermolecular, occurring, between, separate, molecules, or, intramolecular, occurring, among, parts, of, the, same, molecule, the, energy, of, a, hydrogen, bond, depends, on, the, geometry, the, environment, and, the, nature, of, the, specific, donor, and, acceptor, atoms, and, can, vary, between, 1, and, 40, kcal, mol, this, makes, them, somewhat, stronger, than, a, van, der, waals, interaction, and, weaker, than, fully, covalent, or, ionic, bonds, this, type, of, bond, can, occur, in, inorganic, molecules, such, as, water, and, in, organic, molecules, like, dna, and, proteins, hydrogen, bonds, are, responsible, for, holding, materials, such, as, paper, and, felted, wool, together, and, for, causing, separate, sheets, of, paper, to, stick, together, after, becoming, wet, and, subsequently, drying, the, hydrogen, bond, is, also, responsible, for, many, of, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, compounds, of, n, o, and, f, that, seem, unusual, compared, with, other, similar, structures, in, particular, intermolecular, hydrogen, bonding, is, responsible, for, the, high, boiling, point, of, water, 100, c, compared, to, the, other, group, 16, hydrides, that, have, much, weaker, hydrogen, bonds, intramolecular, hydrogen, bonding, is, partly, responsible, for, the, secondary, and, tertiary, structures, of, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, in, a, hydrogen, bond, the, electronegative, atom, not, covalently, attached, to, the, hydrogen, is, named, the, proton, acceptor, whereas, the, one, covalently, bound, to, the, hydrogen, is, named, the, proton, donor, this, nomenclature, is, recommended, by, the, iupac, the, hydrogen, of, the, donor, is, protic, and, therefore, can, act, as, a, lewis, acid, and, the, acceptor, is, the, lewis, base, hydrogen, bonds, are, represented, as, h, y, system, where, the, dots, represent, the, hydrogen, bond, liquids, that, display, hydrogen, bonding, such, as, water, are, called, associated, liquids, hydrogen, bonds, arise, from, a, combination, of, electrostatics, multipole, multipole, and, multipole, induced, multipole, interactions, covalency, charge, transfer, by, orbital, overlap, and, dispersion, london, forces, in, weaker, hydrogen, bonds, hydrogen, atoms, tend, to, bond, to, elements, such, as, sulfur, s, or, chlorine, cl, even, carbon, c, can, serve, as, a, donor, particularly, when, the, carbon, or, one, of, its, neighbors, is, electronegative, e, g, in, chloroform, aldehydes, and, terminal, acetylenes, gradually, it, was, recognized, that, there, are, many, examples, of, weaker, hydrogen, bonding, involving, donor, other, than, n, o, or, f, and, or, acceptor, ac, with, electronegativity, approaching, that, of, hydrogen, rather, than, being, much, more, electronegative, although, weak, 1, kcal, mol, non, traditional, hydrogen, bonding, interactions, are, ubiquitous, and, influence, structures, of, many, kinds, of, materials, the, definition, of, hydrogen, bonding, has, gradually, broadened, over, time, to, include, these, weaker, attractive, interactions, in, 2011, an, iupac, task, group, recommended, a, modern, evidence, based, definition, of, hydrogen, bonding, which, was, published, in, the, iupac, journal, pure, and, applied, chemistry, this, definition, specifies, the, hydrogen, bond, is, an, attractive, interaction, between, a, hydrogen, atom, from, a, molecule, or, a, molecular, fragment, x, h, in, which, x, is, more, electronegative, than, h, and, an, atom, or, a, group, of, atoms, in, the, same, or, another, molecule, in, which, there, is, evidence, of, bond, formation, hydrogen, bonds, can, vary, in, strength, from, weak, 1, 2, kj, mol, to, strong, 161, 5, kj, mol, in, the, bifluoride, ion, hf, 2, typical, enthalpies, in, vapor, include, the, strength, of, intermolecular, hydrogen, bonds, is, most, often, evaluated, by, measurements, of, equilibria, between, molecules, containing, donor, and, or, acceptor, units, most, often, in, solution, the, strength, of, intramolecular, hydrogen, bonds, can, be, studied, with, equilibria, between, conformers, with, and, without, hydrogen, bonds, the, most, important, method, for, the, identification, of, hydrogen, bonds, also, in, complicated, molecules, is, crystallography, sometimes, also, nmr, spectroscopy, structural, details, in, particular, distances, between, donor, and, acceptor, which, are, smaller, than, the, sum, of, the, van, der, waals, radii, can, be, taken, as, indication, of, the, hydrogen, bond, strength, one, scheme, gives, the, following, somewhat, arbitrary, classification, those, that, are, 15, to, 40, kcal, mol, 5, to, 15, kcal, mol, and, 0, to, 5, kcal, mol, are, considered, strong, moderate, and, weak, respectively, hydrogen, bonds, involving, c, h, bonds, are, both, very, rare, and, weak, the, resonance, assisted, hydrogen, bond, commonly, abbreviated, as, rahb, is, a, strong, type, of, hydrogen, bond, it, is, characterized, by, the, delocalization, that, involves, the, hydrogen, and, cannot, be, properly, described, by, the, electrostatic, model, alone, this, description, of, the, hydrogen, bond, has, been, proposed, to, describe, unusually, short, distances, generally, observed, between, o, c, oh, or, o, c, c, c, oh, the, x, h, distance, is, typically, 110, pm, whereas, the, h, y, distance, is, 160, to, 200, pm, the, typical, length, of, a, hydrogen, bond, in, water, is, 197, pm, the, ideal, bond, angle, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, hydrogen, bond, donor, the, following, hydrogen, bond, angles, between, a, hydrofluoric, acid, donor, and, various, acceptors, have, been, determined, experimentally, strong, hydrogen, bonds, are, revealed, by, downfield, shifts, in, the, 1, h, nmr, spectrum, for, example, the, acidic, proton, in, the, enol, tautomer, of, acetylacetone, appears, at, h, displaystyle, delta, text, h, 15, 5, which, is, about, 10, ppm, downfield, of, a, conventional, alcohol, in, the, ir, spectrum, hydrogen, bonding, shifts, the, x, h, stretching, frequency, to, lower, energy, i, e, the, vibration, frequency, decreases, this, shift, reflects, a, weakening, of, the, x, h, bond, certain, hydrogen, bonds, improper, hydrogen, bonds, show, a, blue, shift, of, the, x, h, stretching, frequency, and, a, decrease, in, the, bond, length, h, bonds, can, also, be, measured, by, ir, vibrational, mode, shifts, of, the, acceptor, the, amide, i, mode, of, backbone, carbonyls, in, helices, shifts, to, lower, frequencies, when, they, form, h, bonds, with, side, chain, hydroxyl, groups, the, dynamics, of, hydrogen, bond, structures, in, water, can, be, probed, by, this, oh, stretching, vibration, in, the, hydrogen, bonding, network, in, protic, organic, ionic, plastic, crystals, poipcs, which, are, a, type, of, phase, change, material, exhibiting, solid, solid, phase, transitions, prior, to, melting, variable, temperature, infrared, spectroscopy, can, reveal, the, temperature, dependence, of, hydrogen, bonds, and, the, dynamics, of, both, the, anions, and, the, cations, the, sudden, weakening, of, hydrogen, bonds, during, the, solid, solid, phase, transition, seems, to, be, coupled, with, the, onset, of, orientational, or, rotational, disorder, of, the, ions, hydrogen, bonding, is, of, persistent, theoretical, interest, according, to, a, modern, description, o, h, o, integrates, both, the, intermolecular, o, h, lone, pair, nonbond, and, the, intramolecular, h, o, polar, covalent, bond, associated, with, o, o, repulsive, coupling, quantum, chemical, calculations, of, the, relevant, interresidue, potential, constants, compliance, constants, revealed, large, differences, between, individual, h, bonds, of, the, same, type, for, example, the, central, interresidue, n, h, n, hydrogen, bond, between, guanine, and, cytosine, is, much, stronger, in, comparison, to, the, n, h, n, bond, between, the, adenine, thymine, pair, theoretically, the, bond, strength, of, the, hydrogen, bonds, can, be, assessed, using, nci, index, non, covalent, interactions, index, which, allows, a, visualization, of, these, non, covalent, interactions, as, its, name, indicates, using, the, electron, density, of, the, system, interpretations, of, the, anisotropies, in, the, compton, profile, of, ordinary, ice, claim, that, the, hydrogen, bond, is, partly, covalent, however, this, interpretation, was, challenged, most, generally, the, hydrogen, bond, can, be, viewed, as, a, metric, dependent, electrostatic, scalar, field, between, two, or, more, intermolecular, bonds, this, is, slightly, different, from, the, intramolecular, bound, states, of, for, example, covalent, or, ionic, bonds, however, hydrogen, bonding, is, generally, still, a, bound, state, phenomenon, since, the, interaction, energy, has, a, net, negative, sum, the, initial, theory, of, hydrogen, bonding, proposed, by, linus, pauling, suggested, that, the, hydrogen, bonds, had, a, partial, covalent, nature, this, interpretation, remained, controversial, until, nmr, techniques, demonstrated, information, transfer, between, hydrogen, bonded, nuclei, a, feat, that, would, only, be, possible, if, the, hydrogen, bond, contained, some, covalent, character, the, concept, of, hydrogen, bonding, once, was, challenging, linus, pauling, credits, t, s, moore, and, t, f, winmill, with, the, first, mention, of, the, hydrogen, bond, in, 1912, moore, and, winmill, used, the, hydrogen, bond, to, account, for, the, fact, that, trimethylammonium, hydroxide, is, a, weaker, base, than, tetramethylammonium, hydroxide, the, description, of, hydrogen, bonding, in, its, better, known, setting, water, came, some, years, later, in, 1920, from, latimer, and, rodebush, in, that, paper, latimer, and, rodebush, cited, the, work, of, a, fellow, scientist, at, their, laboratory, maurice, loyal, huggins, saying, mr, huggins, of, this, laboratory, in, some, work, as, yet, unpublished, has, used, the, idea, of, a, hydrogen, kernel, held, between, two, atoms, as, a, theory, in, regard, to, certain, organic, compounds, an, ubiquitous, example, of, a, hydrogen, bond, is, found, between, water, molecules, in, a, discrete, water, molecule, there, are, two, hydrogen, atoms, and, one, oxygen, atom, the, simplest, case, is, a, pair, of, water, molecules, with, one, hydrogen, bond, between, them, which, is, called, the, water, dimer, and, is, often, used, as, a, model, system, when, more, molecules, are, present, as, is, the, case, with, liquid, water, more, bonds, are, possible, because, the, oxygen, of, one, water, molecule, has, two, lone, pairs, of, electrons, each, of, which, can, form, a, hydrogen, bond, with, a, hydrogen, on, another, water, molecule, this, can, repeat, such, that, every, water, molecule, is, h, bonded, with, up, to, four, other, molecules, as, shown, in, the, figure, two, through, its, two, lone, pairs, and, two, through, its, two, hydrogen, atoms, hydrogen, bonding, strongly, affects, the, crystal, structure, of, ice, helping, to, create, an, open, hexagonal, lattice, the, density, of, ice, is, less, than, the, density, of, water, at, the, same, temperature, thus, the, solid, phase, of, water, floats, on, the, liquid, unlike, most, other, substances, liquid, water, s, high, boiling, point, is, due, to, the, high, number, of, hydrogen, bonds, each, molecule, can, form, relative, to, its, low, molecular, mass, owing, to, the, difficulty, of, breaking, these, bonds, water, has, a, very, high, boiling, point, melting, point, and, viscosity, compared, to, otherwise, similar, liquids, not, conjoined, by, hydrogen, bonds, water, is, unique, because, its, oxygen, atom, has, two, lone, pairs, and, two, hydrogen, atoms, meaning, that, the, total, number, of, bonds, of, a, water, molecule, is, up, to, four, the, number, of, hydrogen, bonds, formed, by, a, molecule, of, liquid, water, fluctuates, with, time, and, temperature, from, tip4p, liquid, water, simulations, at, 25, c, it, was, estimated, that, each, water, molecule, participates, in, an, average, of, 3, 59, hydrogen, bonds, at, 100, c, this, number, decreases, to, 3, 24, due, to, the, increased, molecular, motion, and, decreased, density, while, at, 0, c, the, average, number, of, hydrogen, bonds, increases, to, 3, 69, another, study, found, a, much, smaller, number, of, hydrogen, bonds, 2, 357, at, 25, c, defining, and, counting, the, hydrogen, bonds, is, not, straightforward, however, because, water, may, form, hydrogen, bonds, with, solute, proton, donors, and, acceptors, it, may, competitively, inhibit, the, formation, of, solute, intermolecular, or, intramolecular, hydrogen, bonds, consequently, hydrogen, bonds, between, or, within, solute, molecules, dissolved, in, water, are, almost, always, unfavorable, relative, to, hydrogen, bonds, between, water, and, the, donors, and, acceptors, for, hydrogen, bonds, on, those, solutes, hydrogen, bonds, between, water, molecules, have, an, average, lifetime, of, 10, 11, seconds, or, 10, picoseconds, a, single, hydrogen, atom, can, participate, in, two, hydrogen, bonds, this, type, of, bonding, is, called, bifurcated, split, in, two, or, two, forked, it, can, exist, for, instance, in, complex, organic, molecules, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, bifurcated, hydrogen, atom, is, an, essential, step, in, water, reorientation, acceptor, type, hydrogen, bonds, terminating, on, an, oxygen, s, lone, pairs, are, more, likely, to, form, bifurcation, it, is, called, overcoordinated, oxygen, oco, than, are, donor, type, hydrogen, bonds, beginning, on, the, same, oxygen, s, hydrogens, for, example, hydrogen, fluoride, which, has, three, lone, pairs, on, the, f, atom, but, only, one, h, atom, can, form, only, two, bonds, ammonia, has, the, opposite, problem, three, hydrogen, atoms, but, only, one, lone, pair, hydrogen, bonding, plays, an, important, role, in, determining, the, three, dimensional, structures, and, the, properties, adopted, by, many, proteins, compared, to, the, c, c, c, o, and, c, n, bonds, that, comprise, most, polymers, hydrogen, bonds, are, far, weaker, perhaps, 5, thus, hydrogen, bonds, can, be, broken, by, chemical, or, mechanical, means, while, retaining, the, basic, structure, of, the, polymer, backbone, this, hierarchy, of, bond, strengths, covalent, bonds, being, stronger, than, hydrogen, bonds, being, stronger, than, van, der, waals, forces, is, relevant, in, the, properties, of, many, materials, in, these, macromolecules, bonding, between, parts, of, the, same, macromolecule, cause, it, to, fold, into, a, specific, shape, which, helps, determine, the, molecule, s, physiological, or, biochemical, role, for, example, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, is, due, largely, to, hydrogen, bonding, between, its, base, pairs, as, well, as, pi, stacking, interactions, which, link, one, complementary, strand, to, the, other, and, enable, replication, in, the, secondary, structure, of, proteins, hydrogen, bonds, form, between, the, backbone, oxygens, and, amide, hydrogens, when, the, spacing, of, the, amino, acid, residues, participating, in, a, hydrogen, bond, occurs, regularly, between, positions, i, and, i, 4, an, alpha, helix, is, formed, when, the, spacing, is, less, between, positions, i, and, i, 3, then, a, 3, 10, helix, is, formed, when, two, strands, are, joined, by, hydrogen, bonds, involving, alternating, residues, on, each, participating, strand, a, beta, sheet, is, formed, hydrogen, bonds, also, play, a, part, in, forming, the, tertiary, structure, of, protein, through, interaction, of, r, groups, see, also, protein, folding, bifurcated, h, bond, systems, are, common, in, alpha, helical, transmembrane, proteins, between, the, backbone, amide, c, o, of, residue, i, as, the, h, bond, acceptor, and, two, h, bond, donors, from, residue, i, 4, the, backbone, amide, n, h, and, a, side, chain, hydroxyl, or, thiol, h, the, energy, preference, of, the, bifurcated, h, bond, hydroxyl, or, thiol, system, is, 3, 4, kcal, mol, or, 2, 6, kcal, mol, respectively, this, type, of, bifurcated, h, bond, provides, an, intrahelical, h, bonding, partner, for, polar, side, chains, such, as, serine, threonine, and, cysteine, within, the, hydrophobic, membrane, environments, the, role, of, hydrogen, bonds, in, protein, folding, has, also, been, linked, to, osmolyte, induced, protein, stabilization, protective, osmolytes, such, as, trehalose, and, sorbitol, shift, the, protein, folding, equilibrium, toward, the, folded, state, in, a, concentration, dependent, manner, while, the, prevalent, explanation, for, osmolyte, action, relies, on, excluded, volume, effects, that, are, entropic, in, nature, circular, dichroism, cd, experiments, have, shown, osmolyte, to, act, through, an, enthalpic, effect, the, molecular, mechanism, for, their, role, in, protein, stabilization, is, still, not, well, established, though, several, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, computer, molecular, dynamics, simulations, suggest, that, osmolytes, stabilize, proteins, by, modifying, the, hydrogen, bonds, in, the, protein, hydration, layer, several, studies, have, shown, that, hydrogen, bonds, play, an, important, role, for, the, stability, between, subunits, in, multimeric, proteins, for, example, a, study, of, sorbitol, dehydrogenase, displayed, an, important, hydrogen, bonding, network, which, stabilizes, the, tetrameric, quaternary, structure, within, the, mammalian, sorbitol, dehydrogenase, protein, family, a, protein, backbone, hydrogen, bond, incompletely, shielded, from, water, attack, is, a, dehydron, dehydrons, promote, the, removal, of, water, through, proteins, or, ligand, binding, the, exogenous, dehydration, enhances, the, electrostatic, interaction, between, the, amide, and, carbonyl, groups, by, de, shielding, their, partial, charges, furthermore, the, dehydration, stabilizes, the, hydrogen, bond, by, destabilizing, the, nonbonded, state, consisting, of, dehydrated, isolated, charges, wool, being, a, protein, fibre, is, held, together, by, hydrogen, bonds, causing, wool, to, recoil, when, stretched, however, washing, at, high, temperatures, can, permanently, break, the, hydrogen, bonds, and, a, garment, may, permanently, lose, its, shape, the, properties, of, many, polymers, are, affected, by, hydrogen, bonds, within, and, or, between, the, chains, prominent, examples, include, cellulose, and, its, derived, fibers, such, as, cotton, and, flax, in, nylon, hydrogen, bonds, between, carbonyl, and, the, amide, n, h, effectively, link, adjacent, chains, which, gives, the, material, mechanical, strength, hydrogen, bonds, also, affect, the, aramid, fibre, where, hydrogen, bonds, stabilize, the, linear, chains, laterally, the, chain, axes, are, aligned, along, the, fibre, axis, making, the, fibres, extremely, stiff, and, strong, hydrogen, bond, networks, make, both, polymers, sensitive, to, humidity, levels, in, the, atmosphere, because, water, molecules, can, diffuse, into, the, surface, and, disrupt, the, network, some, polymers, are, more, sensitive, than, others, thus, nylons, are, more, sensitive, than, aramids, and, nylon, 6, more, sensitive, than, nylon, 11, a, symmetric, hydrogen, bond, is, a, special, type, of, hydrogen, bond, in, which, the, proton, is, spaced, exactly, halfway, between, two, identical, atoms, the, strength, of, the, bond, to, each, of, those, atoms, is, equal, it, is, an, example, of, a, three, center, four, electron, bond, this, type, of, bond, is, much, stronger, than, a, normal, hydrogen, bond, the, effective, bond, order, is, 0, 5, so, its, strength, is, comparable, to, a, covalent, bond, it, is, seen, in, ice, at, high, pressure, and, also, in, the, solid, phase, of, many, anhydrous, acids, such, as, hydrofluoric, acid, and, formic, acid, at, high, pressure, it, is, also, seen, in, the, bifluoride, ion, due, to, severe, steric, constraint, the, protonated, form, of, proton, sponge, 1, 8, bis, dimethylamino, naphthalene, and, its, derivatives, also, have, symmetric, hydrogen, bonds, although, in, the, case, of, protonated, proton, sponge, the, assembly, is, bent, the, hydrogen, bond, can, be, compared, with, the, closely, related, dihydrogen, bond, which, is, also, an, intermolecular, bonding, interaction, involving, hydrogen, atoms, these, structures, have, been, known, for, some, time, and, well, characterized, by, crystallography, however, an, understanding, of, their, relationship, to, the, conventional, hydrogen, bond, ionic, bond, and, covalent, bond, remains, unclear, generally, the, hydrogen, bond, is, characterized, by, a, proton, acceptor, that, is, a, lone, pair, of, electrons, in, nonmetallic, atoms, most, notably, in, the, nitrogen, and, chalcogen, groups, in, some, cases, these, proton, acceptors, may, be, pi, bonds, or, metal, complexes, in, the, dihydrogen, bond, however, a, metal, hydride, serves, as, a, proton, acceptor, thus, forming, a, hydrogen, hydrogen, interaction, neutron, diffraction, has, shown, that, the, molecular, geometry, of, these, complexes, is, similar, to, hydrogen, bonds, in, that, the, bond, length, is, very, adaptable, to, the, metal, complex, hydrogen, donor, system, the, hydrogen, bond, is, relevant, to, drug, design, according, to, lipinski, s, rule, of, five, the, majority, of, orally, active, drugs, have, no, more, than, five, hydrogen, bond, donors, and, fewer, than, ten, hydrogen, bond, acceptors, these, interactions, exist, between, nitrogen, hydrogen, and, oxygen, hydrogen, centers, many, drugs, do, not, however, obey, these, rules
