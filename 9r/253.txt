a, binary, star, or, binary, star, system, is, a, system, of, two, stars, that, are, gravitationally, bound, to, and, in, orbit, around, each, other, binary, stars, in, the, night, sky, that, are, seen, as, a, single, object, to, the, naked, eye, are, often, resolved, as, separate, stars, using, a, telescope, in, which, case, they, are, called, visual, binaries, many, visual, binaries, have, long, orbital, periods, of, several, centuries, or, millennia, and, therefore, have, orbits, which, are, uncertain, or, poorly, known, they, may, also, be, detected, by, indirect, techniques, such, as, spectroscopy, spectroscopic, binaries, or, astrometry, astrometric, binaries, if, a, binary, star, happens, to, orbit, in, a, plane, along, our, line, of, sight, its, components, will, eclipse, and, transit, each, other, these, pairs, are, called, eclipsing, binaries, or, together, with, other, binaries, that, change, brightness, as, they, orbit, photometric, binaries, if, components, in, binary, star, systems, are, close, enough, they, can, gravitationally, distort, each, other, s, outer, stellar, atmospheres, in, some, cases, these, close, binary, systems, can, exchange, mass, which, may, bring, their, evolution, to, stages, that, single, stars, cannot, attain, examples, of, binaries, are, sirius, and, cygnus, x, 1, cygnus, x, 1, being, a, well, known, black, hole, binary, stars, are, also, common, as, the, nuclei, of, many, planetary, nebulae, and, are, the, progenitors, of, both, novae, and, type, ia, supernovae, double, stars, a, pair, of, stars, that, appear, close, to, each, other, have, been, observed, since, the, invention, of, the, telescope, early, examples, include, mizar, and, acrux, mizar, in, the, big, dipper, ursa, major, was, observed, to, be, double, by, giovanni, battista, riccioli, in, 1650, and, probably, earlier, by, benedetto, castelli, and, galileo, the, bright, southern, star, acrux, in, the, southern, cross, was, discovered, to, be, double, by, father, fontenay, in, 1685, evidence, that, stars, in, pairs, were, more, than, just, optical, alignments, came, in, 1767, when, english, natural, philosopher, and, clergyman, john, michell, became, the, first, person, to, apply, the, mathematics, of, statistics, to, the, study, of, the, stars, demonstrating, in, a, paper, that, many, more, stars, occur, in, pairs, or, groups, than, a, perfectly, random, distribution, and, chance, alignment, could, account, for, he, focused, his, investigation, on, the, pleiades, cluster, and, calculated, that, the, likelihood, of, finding, such, a, close, grouping, of, stars, was, about, one, in, half, a, million, he, concluded, that, the, stars, in, these, double, or, multiple, star, systems, might, be, drawn, to, one, another, by, gravitational, pull, thus, providing, the, first, evidence, for, the, existence, of, binary, stars, and, star, clusters, william, herschel, began, observing, double, stars, in, 1779, hoping, to, find, a, near, star, paired, with, a, distant, star, so, he, could, measure, the, near, star, s, changing, position, as, the, earth, orbited, the, sun, measure, its, parallax, allowing, him, to, calculate, the, distance, to, the, near, star, he, would, soon, publish, catalogs, of, about, 700, double, stars, by, 1803, he, had, observed, changes, in, the, relative, positions, in, a, number, of, double, stars, over, the, course, of, 25, years, and, concluded, that, instead, of, showing, parallax, changes, they, seemed, to, be, orbiting, each, other, in, binary, systems, the, first, orbit, of, a, binary, star, was, computed, in, 1827, when, f, lix, savary, computed, the, orbit, of, xi, ursae, majoris, over, the, years, many, more, double, stars, have, been, catalogued, and, measured, as, of, june, 2017, the, washington, double, star, catalog, a, database, of, visual, double, stars, compiled, by, the, united, states, naval, observatory, contains, over, 100, 000, pairs, of, double, stars, including, optical, doubles, as, well, as, binary, stars, orbits, are, known, for, only, a, few, thousand, of, these, double, stars, the, term, binary, was, first, used, in, this, context, by, sir, william, herschel, in, 1802, when, he, wrote, if, on, the, contrary, two, stars, should, really, be, situated, very, near, each, other, and, at, the, same, time, so, far, insulated, as, not, to, be, materially, affected, by, the, attractions, of, neighbouring, stars, they, will, then, compose, a, separate, system, and, remain, united, by, the, bond, of, their, own, mutual, gravitation, towards, each, other, this, should, be, called, a, real, double, star, and, any, two, stars, that, are, thus, mutually, connected, form, the, binary, sidereal, system, which, we, are, now, to, consider, by, the, modern, definition, the, term, binary, star, is, generally, restricted, to, pairs, of, stars, which, revolve, around, a, common, center, of, mass, binary, stars, which, can, be, resolved, with, a, telescope, or, interferometric, methods, are, known, as, visual, binaries, for, most, of, the, known, visual, binary, stars, one, whole, revolution, has, not, been, observed, yet, rather, they, are, observed, to, have, travelled, along, a, curved, path, or, a, partial, arc, the, more, general, term, double, star, is, used, for, pairs, of, stars, which, are, seen, to, be, close, together, in, the, sky, this, distinction, is, rarely, made, in, languages, other, than, english, double, stars, may, be, binary, systems, or, may, be, merely, two, stars, that, appear, to, be, close, together, in, the, sky, but, have, vastly, different, true, distances, from, the, sun, the, latter, are, termed, optical, doubles, or, optical, pairs, binary, stars, are, classified, into, four, types, according, to, the, way, in, which, they, are, observed, visually, by, observation, spectroscopically, by, periodic, changes, in, spectral, lines, photometrically, by, changes, in, brightness, caused, by, an, eclipse, or, astrometrically, by, measuring, a, deviation, in, a, star, s, position, caused, by, an, unseen, companion, any, binary, star, can, belong, to, several, of, these, classes, for, example, several, spectroscopic, binaries, are, also, eclipsing, binaries, a, visual, binary, star, is, a, binary, star, for, which, the, angular, separation, between, the, two, components, is, great, enough, to, permit, them, to, be, observed, as, a, double, star, in, a, telescope, or, even, high, powered, binoculars, the, angular, resolution, of, the, telescope, is, an, important, factor, in, the, detection, of, visual, binaries, and, as, better, angular, resolutions, are, applied, to, binary, star, observations, an, increasing, number, of, visual, binaries, will, be, detected, the, relative, brightness, of, the, two, stars, is, also, an, important, factor, as, glare, from, a, bright, star, may, make, it, difficult, to, detect, the, presence, of, a, fainter, component, the, brighter, star, of, a, visual, binary, is, the, primary, star, and, the, dimmer, is, considered, the, secondary, in, some, publications, especially, older, ones, a, faint, secondary, is, called, the, comes, plural, comites, companion, if, the, stars, are, the, same, brightness, the, discoverer, designation, for, the, primary, is, customarily, accepted, the, position, angle, of, the, secondary, with, respect, to, the, primary, is, measured, together, with, the, angular, distance, between, the, two, stars, the, time, of, observation, is, also, recorded, after, a, sufficient, number, of, observations, are, recorded, over, a, period, of, time, they, are, plotted, in, polar, coordinates, with, the, primary, star, at, the, origin, and, the, most, probable, ellipse, is, drawn, through, these, points, such, that, the, keplerian, law, of, areas, is, satisfied, this, ellipse, is, known, as, the, apparent, ellipse, and, is, the, projection, of, the, actual, elliptical, orbit, of, the, secondary, with, respect, to, the, primary, on, the, plane, of, the, sky, from, this, projected, ellipse, the, complete, elements, of, the, orbit, may, be, computed, where, the, semi, major, axis, can, only, be, expressed, in, angular, units, unless, the, stellar, parallax, and, hence, the, distance, of, the, system, is, known, sometimes, the, only, evidence, of, a, binary, star, comes, from, the, doppler, effect, on, its, emitted, light, in, these, cases, the, binary, consists, of, a, pair, of, stars, where, the, spectral, lines, in, the, light, emitted, from, each, star, shifts, first, towards, the, blue, then, towards, the, red, as, each, moves, first, towards, us, and, then, away, from, us, during, its, motion, about, their, common, center, of, mass, with, the, period, of, their, common, orbit, in, these, systems, the, separation, between, the, stars, is, usually, very, small, and, the, orbital, velocity, very, high, unless, the, plane, of, the, orbit, happens, to, be, perpendicular, to, the, line, of, sight, the, orbital, velocities, have, components, in, the, line, of, sight, and, the, observed, radial, velocity, of, the, system, varies, periodically, since, radial, velocity, can, be, measured, with, a, spectrometer, by, observing, the, doppler, shift, of, the, stars, spectral, lines, the, binaries, detected, in, this, manner, are, known, as, spectroscopic, binaries, most, of, these, cannot, be, resolved, as, a, visual, binary, even, with, telescopes, of, the, highest, existing, resolving, power, in, some, spectroscopic, binaries, spectral, lines, from, both, stars, are, visible, and, the, lines, are, alternately, double, and, single, such, a, system, is, known, as, a, double, lined, spectroscopic, binary, often, denoted, sb2, in, other, systems, the, spectrum, of, only, one, of, the, stars, is, seen, and, the, lines, in, the, spectrum, shift, periodically, towards, the, blue, then, towards, red, and, back, again, such, stars, are, known, as, single, lined, spectroscopic, binaries, sb1, the, orbit, of, a, spectroscopic, binary, is, determined, by, making, a, long, series, of, observations, of, the, radial, velocity, of, one, or, both, components, of, the, system, the, observations, are, plotted, against, time, and, from, the, resulting, curve, a, period, is, determined, if, the, orbit, is, circular, then, the, curve, is, a, sine, curve, if, the, orbit, is, elliptical, the, shape, of, the, curve, depends, on, the, eccentricity, of, the, ellipse, and, the, orientation, of, the, major, axis, with, reference, to, the, line, of, sight, it, is, impossible, to, determine, individually, the, semi, major, axis, a, and, the, inclination, of, the, orbit, plane, i, however, the, product, of, the, semi, major, axis, and, the, sine, of, the, inclination, i, e, a, sin, i, may, be, determined, directly, in, linear, units, e, g, kilometres, if, either, a, or, i, can, be, determined, by, other, means, as, in, the, case, of, eclipsing, binaries, a, complete, solution, for, the, orbit, can, be, found, binary, stars, that, are, both, visual, and, spectroscopic, binaries, are, rare, and, are, a, valuable, source, of, information, when, found, about, 40, are, known, visual, binary, stars, often, have, large, true, separations, with, periods, measured, in, decades, to, centuries, consequently, they, usually, have, orbital, speeds, too, small, to, be, measured, spectroscopically, conversely, spectroscopic, binary, stars, move, fast, in, their, orbits, because, they, are, close, together, usually, too, close, to, be, detected, as, visual, binaries, binaries, that, are, found, to, be, both, visual, and, spectroscopic, thus, must, be, relatively, close, to, earth, an, eclipsing, binary, star, is, a, binary, star, system, in, which, the, orbital, plane, of, the, two, stars, lies, so, nearly, in, the, line, of, sight, of, the, observer, that, the, components, undergo, mutual, eclipses, in, the, case, where, the, binary, is, also, a, spectroscopic, binary, and, the, parallax, of, the, system, is, known, the, binary, is, quite, valuable, for, stellar, analysis, algol, a, triple, star, system, in, the, constellation, perseus, contains, the, best, known, example, of, an, eclipsing, binary, eclipsing, binaries, are, variable, stars, not, because, the, light, of, the, individual, components, vary, but, because, of, the, eclipses, the, light, curve, of, an, eclipsing, binary, is, characterized, by, periods, of, practically, constant, light, with, periodic, drops, in, intensity, when, one, star, passes, in, front, of, the, other, the, brightness, may, drop, twice, during, the, orbit, once, when, the, secondary, passes, in, front, of, the, primary, and, once, when, the, primary, passes, in, front, of, the, secondary, the, deeper, of, the, two, eclipses, is, called, the, primary, regardless, of, which, star, is, being, occulted, and, if, a, shallow, second, eclipse, also, occurs, it, is, called, the, secondary, eclipse, the, size, of, the, brightness, drops, depends, on, the, relative, brightness, of, the, two, stars, the, proportion, of, the, occulted, star, that, is, hidden, and, the, surface, brightness, i, e, effective, temperature, of, the, stars, typically, the, occultation, of, the, hotter, star, causes, the, primary, eclipse, an, eclipsing, binary, s, period, of, orbit, may, be, determined, from, a, study, of, its, light, curve, and, the, relative, sizes, of, the, individual, stars, can, be, determined, in, terms, of, the, radius, of, the, orbit, by, observing, how, quickly, the, brightness, changes, as, the, disc, of, the, nearest, star, slides, over, the, disc, of, the, other, star, if, it, is, also, a, spectroscopic, binary, the, orbital, elements, can, also, be, determined, and, the, mass, of, the, stars, can, be, determined, relatively, easily, which, means, that, the, relative, densities, of, the, stars, can, be, determined, in, this, case, since, about, 1995, measurement, of, extragalactic, eclipsing, binaries, fundamental, parameters, has, become, possible, with, 8, meter, class, telescopes, this, makes, it, feasible, to, use, them, to, directly, measure, the, distances, to, external, galaxies, a, process, that, is, more, accurate, than, using, standard, candles, by, 2006, they, had, been, used, to, give, direct, distance, estimates, to, the, lmc, smc, andromeda, galaxy, and, triangulum, galaxy, eclipsing, binaries, offer, a, direct, method, to, gauge, the, distance, to, galaxies, to, an, improved, 5, level, of, accuracy, nearby, non, eclipsing, binaries, can, also, be, photometrically, detected, by, observing, how, the, stars, affect, each, other, in, three, ways, the, first, is, by, observing, extra, light, which, the, stars, reflect, from, their, companion, second, is, by, observing, ellipsoidal, light, variations, which, are, caused, by, deformation, of, the, star, s, shape, by, their, companions, the, third, method, is, by, looking, at, how, relativistic, beaming, affects, the, apparent, magnitude, of, the, stars, detecting, binaries, with, these, methods, requires, accurate, photometry, astronomers, have, discovered, some, stars, that, seemingly, orbit, around, an, empty, space, astrometric, binaries, are, relatively, nearby, stars, which, can, be, seen, to, wobble, around, a, point, in, space, with, no, visible, companion, the, same, mathematics, used, for, ordinary, binaries, can, be, applied, to, infer, the, mass, of, the, missing, companion, the, companion, could, be, very, dim, so, that, it, is, currently, undetectable, or, masked, by, the, glare, of, its, primary, or, it, could, be, an, object, that, emits, little, or, no, electromagnetic, radiation, for, example, a, neutron, star, the, visible, star, s, position, is, carefully, measured, and, detected, to, vary, due, to, the, gravitational, influence, from, its, counterpart, the, position, of, the, star, is, repeatedly, measured, relative, to, more, distant, stars, and, then, checked, for, periodic, shifts, in, position, typically, this, type, of, measurement, can, only, be, performed, on, nearby, stars, such, as, those, within, 10, parsecs, nearby, stars, often, have, a, relatively, high, proper, motion, so, astrometric, binaries, will, appear, to, follow, a, wobbly, path, across, the, sky, if, the, companion, is, sufficiently, massive, to, cause, an, observable, shift, in, position, of, the, star, then, its, presence, can, be, deduced, from, precise, astrometric, measurements, of, the, movement, of, the, visible, star, over, a, sufficiently, long, period, of, time, information, about, the, mass, of, the, companion, and, its, orbital, period, can, be, determined, even, though, the, companion, is, not, visible, the, characteristics, of, the, system, can, be, determined, from, the, observations, using, kepler, s, laws, this, method, of, detecting, binaries, is, also, used, to, locate, extrasolar, planets, orbiting, a, star, however, the, requirements, to, perform, this, measurement, are, very, exacting, due, to, the, great, difference, in, the, mass, ratio, and, the, typically, long, period, of, the, planet, s, orbit, detection, of, position, shifts, of, a, star, is, a, very, exacting, science, and, it, is, difficult, to, achieve, the, necessary, precision, space, telescopes, can, avoid, the, blurring, effect, of, earth, s, atmosphere, resulting, in, more, precise, resolution, another, classification, is, based, on, the, distance, between, the, stars, relative, to, their, sizes, detached, binaries, are, binary, stars, where, each, component, is, within, its, roche, lobe, i, e, the, area, where, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, star, itself, is, larger, than, that, of, the, other, component, while, on, the, main, sequence, the, stars, have, no, major, effect, on, each, other, and, essentially, evolve, separately, most, binaries, belong, to, this, class, semidetached, binary, stars, are, binary, stars, where, one, of, the, components, fills, the, binary, star, s, roche, lobe, and, the, other, does, not, gas, from, the, surface, of, the, roche, lobe, filling, component, donor, is, transferred, to, the, other, accreting, star, the, mass, transfer, dominates, the, evolution, of, the, system, in, many, cases, the, inflowing, gas, forms, an, accretion, disc, around, the, accretor, a, contact, binary, is, a, type, of, binary, star, in, which, both, components, of, the, binary, fill, their, roche, lobes, the, uppermost, part, of, the, stellar, atmospheres, forms, a, common, envelope, that, surrounds, both, stars, as, the, friction, of, the, envelope, brakes, the, orbital, motion, the, stars, may, eventually, merge, w, ursae, majoris, is, an, example, when, a, binary, system, contains, a, compact, object, such, as, a, white, dwarf, neutron, star, or, black, hole, gas, from, the, other, donor, star, can, accrete, onto, the, compact, object, this, releases, gravitational, potential, energy, causing, the, gas, to, become, hotter, and, emit, radiation, cataclysmic, variable, stars, where, the, compact, object, is, a, white, dwarf, are, examples, of, such, systems, in, x, ray, binaries, the, compact, object, can, be, either, a, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, these, binaries, are, classified, as, low, mass, or, high, mass, according, to, the, mass, of, the, donor, star, high, mass, x, ray, binaries, contain, a, young, early, type, high, mass, donor, star, which, transfers, mass, by, its, stellar, wind, while, low, mass, x, ray, binaries, are, semidetached, binaries, in, which, gas, from, a, late, type, donor, star, or, a, white, dwarf, overflows, the, roche, lobe, and, falls, towards, the, neutron, star, or, black, hole, probably, the, best, known, example, of, an, x, ray, binary, is, the, high, mass, x, ray, binary, cygnus, x, 1, in, cygnus, x, 1, the, mass, of, the, unseen, companion, is, estimated, to, be, about, nine, times, that, of, the, sun, far, exceeding, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, for, the, maximum, theoretical, mass, of, a, neutron, star, it, is, therefore, believed, to, be, a, black, hole, it, was, the, first, object, for, which, this, was, widely, believed, orbital, periods, can, be, less, than, an, hour, for, am, cvn, stars, or, a, few, days, components, of, beta, lyrae, but, also, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, proxima, centauri, around, alpha, centauri, ab, the, applegate, mechanism, explains, long, term, orbital, period, variations, seen, in, certain, eclipsing, binaries, as, a, main, sequence, star, goes, through, an, activity, cycle, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, are, subject, to, a, magnetic, torque, changing, the, distribution, of, angular, momentum, resulting, in, a, change, in, the, star, s, oblateness, the, orbit, of, the, stars, in, the, binary, pair, is, gravitationally, coupled, to, their, shape, changes, so, that, the, period, shows, modulations, typically, on, the, order, of, p, p, 10, 5, on, the, same, time, scale, as, the, activity, cycles, typically, on, the, order, of, decades, another, phenomenon, observed, in, some, algol, binaries, has, been, monotonic, period, increases, this, is, quite, distinct, from, the, far, more, common, observations, of, alternating, period, increases, and, decreases, explained, by, the, applegate, mechanism, monotonic, period, increases, have, been, attributed, to, mass, transfer, usually, but, not, always, from, the, less, massive, to, the, more, massive, star, the, components, of, binary, stars, are, denoted, by, the, suffixes, a, and, b, appended, to, the, system, s, designation, a, denoting, the, primary, and, b, the, secondary, the, suffix, ab, may, be, used, to, denote, the, pair, for, example, the, binary, star, centauri, ab, consists, of, the, stars, centauri, a, and, centauri, b, additional, letters, such, as, c, d, etc, may, be, used, for, systems, with, more, than, two, stars, in, cases, where, the, binary, star, has, a, bayer, designation, and, is, widely, separated, it, is, possible, that, the, members, of, the, pair, will, be, designated, with, superscripts, an, example, is, zeta, reticuli, whose, components, are, 1, reticuli, and, 2, reticuli, double, stars, are, also, designated, by, an, abbreviation, giving, the, discoverer, together, with, an, index, number, centauri, for, example, was, found, to, be, double, by, father, richaud, in, 1689, and, so, is, designated, rhd, 1, these, discoverer, codes, can, be, found, in, the, washington, double, star, catalog, the, secondary, star, in, a, binary, star, system, may, be, designated, as, the, hot, companion, or, cool, companion, depending, on, its, temperature, relative, to, the, primary, star, examples, while, it, is, not, impossible, that, some, binaries, might, be, created, through, gravitational, capture, between, two, single, stars, given, the, very, low, likelihood, of, such, an, event, three, objects, being, actually, required, as, conservation, of, energy, rules, out, a, single, gravitating, body, capturing, another, and, the, high, number, of, binaries, currently, in, existence, this, cannot, be, the, primary, formation, process, the, observation, of, binaries, consisting, of, stars, not, yet, on, the, main, sequence, supports, the, theory, that, binaries, develop, during, star, formation, fragmentation, of, the, molecular, cloud, during, the, formation, of, protostars, is, an, acceptable, explanation, for, the, formation, of, a, binary, or, multiple, star, system, the, outcome, of, the, three, body, problem, in, which, the, three, stars, are, of, comparable, mass, is, that, eventually, one, of, the, three, stars, will, be, ejected, from, the, system, and, assuming, no, significant, further, perturbations, the, remaining, two, will, form, a, stable, binary, system, as, a, main, sequence, star, increases, in, size, during, its, evolution, it, may, at, some, point, exceed, its, roche, lobe, meaning, that, some, of, its, matter, ventures, into, a, region, where, the, gravitational, pull, of, its, companion, star, is, larger, than, its, own, the, result, is, that, matter, will, transfer, from, one, star, to, another, through, a, process, known, as, roche, lobe, overflow, rlof, either, being, absorbed, by, direct, impact, or, through, an, accretion, disc, the, mathematical, point, through, which, this, transfer, happens, is, called, the, first, lagrangian, point, it, is, not, uncommon, that, the, accretion, disc, is, the, brightest, and, thus, sometimes, the, only, visible, element, of, a, binary, star, if, a, star, grows, outside, of, its, roche, lobe, too, fast, for, all, abundant, matter, to, be, transferred, to, the, other, component, it, is, also, possible, that, matter, will, leave, the, system, through, other, lagrange, points, or, as, stellar, wind, thus, being, effectively, lost, to, both, components, since, the, evolution, of, a, star, is, determined, by, its, mass, the, process, influences, the, evolution, of, both, companions, and, creates, stages, that, cannot, be, attained, by, single, stars, studies, of, the, eclipsing, ternary, algol, led, to, the, algol, paradox, in, the, theory, of, stellar, evolution, although, components, of, a, binary, star, form, at, the, same, time, and, massive, stars, evolve, much, faster, than, the, less, massive, ones, it, was, observed, that, the, more, massive, component, algol, a, is, still, in, the, main, sequence, while, the, less, massive, algol, b, is, a, subgiant, at, a, later, evolutionary, stage, the, paradox, can, be, solved, by, mass, transfer, when, the, more, massive, star, became, a, subgiant, it, filled, its, roche, lobe, and, most, of, the, mass, was, transferred, to, the, other, star, which, is, still, in, the, main, sequence, in, some, binaries, similar, to, algol, a, gas, flow, can, actually, be, seen, it, is, also, possible, for, widely, separated, binaries, to, lose, gravitational, contact, with, each, other, during, their, lifetime, as, a, result, of, external, perturbations, the, components, will, then, move, on, to, evolve, as, single, stars, a, close, encounter, between, two, binary, systems, can, also, result, in, the, gravitational, disruption, of, both, systems, with, some, of, the, stars, being, ejected, at, high, velocities, leading, to, runaway, stars, if, a, white, dwarf, has, a, close, companion, star, that, overflows, its, roche, lobe, the, white, dwarf, will, steadily, accrete, gases, from, the, star, s, outer, atmosphere, these, are, compacted, on, the, white, dwarf, s, surface, by, its, intense, gravity, compressed, and, heated, to, very, high, temperatures, as, additional, material, is, drawn, in, the, white, dwarf, consists, of, degenerate, matter, and, so, is, largely, unresponsive, to, heat, while, the, accreted, hydrogen, is, not, hydrogen, fusion, can, occur, in, a, stable, manner, on, the, surface, through, the, cno, cycle, causing, the, enormous, amount, of, energy, liberated, by, this, process, to, blow, the, remaining, gases, away, from, the, white, dwarf, s, surface, the, result, is, an, extremely, bright, outburst, of, light, known, as, a, nova, in, extreme, cases, this, event, can, cause, the, white, dwarf, to, exceed, the, chandrasekhar, limit, and, trigger, a, supernova, that, destroys, the, entire, star, another, possible, cause, for, runaways, an, example, of, such, an, event, is, the, supernova, sn, 1572, which, was, observed, by, tycho, brahe, the, hubble, space, telescope, recently, took, a, picture, of, the, remnants, of, this, event, binaries, provide, the, best, method, for, astronomers, to, determine, the, mass, of, a, distant, star, the, gravitational, pull, between, them, causes, them, to, orbit, around, their, common, center, of, mass, from, the, orbital, pattern, of, a, visual, binary, or, the, time, variation, of, the, spectrum, of, a, spectroscopic, binary, the, mass, of, its, stars, can, be, determined, for, example, with, the, binary, mass, function, in, this, way, the, relation, between, a, star, s, appearance, temperature, and, radius, and, its, mass, can, be, found, which, allows, for, the, determination, of, the, mass, of, non, binaries, because, a, large, proportion, of, stars, exist, in, binary, systems, binaries, are, particularly, important, to, our, understanding, of, the, processes, by, which, stars, form, in, particular, the, period, and, masses, of, the, binary, tell, us, about, the, amount, of, angular, momentum, in, the, system, because, this, is, a, conserved, quantity, in, physics, binaries, give, us, important, clues, about, the, conditions, under, which, the, stars, were, formed, in, a, simple, binary, case, the, distance, r, 1, from, the, center, of, the, first, star, to, the, center, of, mass, or, barycenter, is, given, by, r, 1, a, m, 2, m, 1, m, 2, a, 1, m, 1, m, 2, displaystyle, r, 1, a, cdot, frac, m, 2, m, 1, m, 2, frac, a, 1, frac, m, 1, m, 2, where, if, a, is, taken, to, be, the, semimajor, axis, of, the, orbit, of, one, body, around, the, other, then, r, 1, is, the, semimajor, axis, of, the, first, body, s, orbit, around, the, center, of, mass, or, barycenter, and, r, 2, a, r, 1, is, the, semimajor, axis, of, the, second, body, s, orbit, when, the, center, of, mass, is, located, within, the, more, massive, body, that, body, appears, to, wobble, rather, than, following, a, discernible, orbit, the, red, cross, marks, the, center, of, mass, of, the, system, these, images, do, not, represent, any, specific, real, system, it, is, estimated, that, approximately, one, third, of, the, star, systems, in, the, milky, way, are, binary, or, multiple, with, the, remaining, two, thirds, being, single, stars, the, overall, multiplicity, frequency, of, ordinary, stars, is, a, monotonically, increasing, function, of, stellar, mass, that, is, the, likelihood, of, being, in, a, binary, or, a, multi, star, system, steadily, increases, as, the, masses, of, the, components, increase, there, is, a, direct, correlation, between, the, period, of, revolution, of, a, binary, star, and, the, eccentricity, of, its, orbit, with, systems, of, short, period, having, smaller, eccentricity, binary, stars, may, be, found, with, any, conceivable, separation, from, pairs, orbiting, so, closely, that, they, are, practically, in, contact, with, each, other, to, pairs, so, distantly, separated, that, their, connection, is, indicated, only, by, their, common, proper, motion, through, space, among, gravitationally, bound, binary, star, systems, there, exists, a, so, called, log, normal, distribution, of, periods, with, the, majority, of, these, systems, orbiting, with, a, period, of, about, 100, years, this, is, supporting, evidence, for, the, theory, that, binary, systems, are, formed, during, star, formation, in, pairs, where, the, two, stars, are, of, equal, brightness, they, are, also, of, the, same, spectral, type, in, systems, where, the, brightnesses, are, different, the, fainter, star, is, bluer, if, the, brighter, star, is, a, giant, star, and, redder, if, the, brighter, star, belongs, to, the, main, sequence, the, mass, of, a, star, can, be, directly, determined, only, from, its, gravitational, attraction, apart, from, the, sun, and, stars, which, act, as, gravitational, lenses, this, can, be, done, only, in, binary, and, multiple, star, systems, making, the, binary, stars, an, important, class, of, stars, in, the, case, of, a, visual, binary, star, after, the, orbit, and, the, stellar, parallax, of, the, system, has, been, determined, the, combined, mass, of, the, two, stars, may, be, obtained, by, a, direct, application, of, the, keplerian, harmonic, law, unfortunately, it, is, impossible, to, obtain, the, complete, orbit, of, a, spectroscopic, binary, unless, it, is, also, a, visual, or, an, eclipsing, binary, so, from, these, objects, only, a, determination, of, the, joint, product, of, mass, and, the, sine, of, the, angle, of, inclination, relative, to, the, line, of, sight, is, possible, in, the, case, of, eclipsing, binaries, which, are, also, spectroscopic, binaries, it, is, possible, to, find, a, complete, solution, for, the, specifications, mass, density, size, luminosity, and, approximate, shape, of, both, members, of, the, system, while, a, number, of, binary, star, systems, have, been, found, to, harbor, extrasolar, planets, such, systems, are, comparatively, rare, compared, to, single, star, systems, observations, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, have, shown, that, most, single, stars, of, the, same, type, as, the, sun, have, plenty, of, planets, but, only, one, third, of, binary, stars, do, according, to, theoretical, simulations, even, widely, separated, binary, stars, often, disrupt, the, discs, of, rocky, grains, from, which, protoplanets, form, on, the, other, hand, other, simulations, suggest, that, the, presence, of, a, binary, companion, can, actually, improve, the, rate, of, planet, formation, within, stable, orbital, zones, by, stirring, up, the, protoplanetary, disk, increasing, the, accretion, rate, of, the, protoplanets, within, detecting, planets, in, multiple, star, systems, introduces, additional, technical, difficulties, which, may, be, why, they, are, only, rarely, found, examples, include, the, white, dwarf, pulsar, binary, psr, b1620, 26, the, subgiant, red, dwarf, binary, gamma, cephei, and, the, white, dwarf, red, dwarf, binary, nn, serpentis, among, others, a, study, of, fourteen, previously, known, planetary, systems, found, three, of, these, systems, to, be, binary, systems, all, planets, were, found, to, be, in, s, type, orbits, around, the, primary, star, in, these, three, cases, the, secondary, star, was, much, dimmer, than, the, primary, and, so, was, not, previously, detected, this, discovery, resulted, in, a, recalculation, of, parameters, for, both, the, planet, and, the, primary, star, science, fiction, has, often, featured, planets, of, binary, or, ternary, stars, as, a, setting, for, example, george, lucas, tatooine, from, star, wars, and, one, notable, story, nightfall, even, takes, this, to, a, six, star, system, in, reality, some, orbital, ranges, are, impossible, for, dynamical, reasons, the, planet, would, be, expelled, from, its, orbit, relatively, quickly, being, either, ejected, from, the, system, altogether, or, transferred, to, a, more, inner, or, outer, orbital, range, whilst, other, orbits, present, serious, challenges, for, eventual, biospheres, because, of, likely, extreme, variations, in, surface, temperature, during, different, parts, of, the, orbit, planets, that, orbit, just, one, star, in, a, binary, system, are, said, to, have, s, type, orbits, whereas, those, that, orbit, around, both, stars, have, p, type, or, circumbinary, orbits, it, is, estimated, that, 50, 60, of, binary, systems, are, capable, of, supporting, habitable, terrestrial, planets, within, stable, orbital, ranges, the, large, distance, between, the, components, as, well, as, their, difference, in, color, make, albireo, one, of, the, easiest, observable, visual, binaries, the, brightest, member, which, is, the, third, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, cygnus, is, actually, a, close, binary, itself, also, in, the, cygnus, constellation, is, cygnus, x, 1, an, x, ray, source, considered, to, be, a, black, hole, it, is, a, high, mass, x, ray, binary, with, the, optical, counterpart, being, a, variable, star, sirius, is, another, binary, and, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, time, sky, with, a, visual, apparent, magnitude, of, 1, 46, it, is, located, in, the, constellation, canis, major, in, 1844, friedrich, bessel, deduced, that, sirius, was, a, binary, in, 1862, alvan, graham, clark, discovered, the, companion, sirius, b, the, visible, star, is, sirius, a, in, 1915, astronomers, at, the, mount, wilson, observatory, determined, that, sirius, b, was, a, white, dwarf, the, first, to, be, discovered, in, 2005, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, astronomers, determined, sirius, b, to, be, 12, 000, km, 7, 456, mi, in, diameter, with, a, mass, that, is, 98, of, the, sun, an, example, of, an, eclipsing, binary, is, epsilon, aurigae, in, the, constellation, auriga, the, visible, component, belongs, to, the, spectral, class, f0, the, other, eclipsing, component, is, not, visible, the, last, such, eclipse, occurred, from, 2009, to, 2011, and, it, is, hoped, that, the, extensive, observations, that, will, likely, be, carried, out, may, yield, further, insights, into, the, nature, of, this, system, another, eclipsing, binary, is, beta, lyrae, which, is, a, semidetached, binary, star, system, in, the, constellation, of, lyra, other, interesting, binaries, include, 61, cygni, a, binary, in, the, constellation, cygnus, composed, of, two, k, class, orange, main, sequence, stars, 61, cygni, a, and, 61, cygni, b, which, is, known, for, its, large, proper, motion, procyon, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, canis, minor, and, the, eighth, brightest, star, in, the, night, time, sky, which, is, a, binary, consisting, of, the, main, star, with, a, faint, white, dwarf,

which, is, thought, to, contain, a, black, hole, with, a, k0, star, in, orbit, around, it, and, 2mass, j18082002, 5104378, a, binary, in, the, thin, disk, of, the, milky, way, and, containing, one, of, the, oldest, known, stars, systems, with, more, than, two, stars, are, termed, multiple, stars, algol, is, the, most, noted, ternary, long, thought, to, be, a, binary, located, in, the, constellation, perseus, two, components, of, the, system, eclipse, each, other, the, variation, in, the, intensity, of, algol, first, being, recorded, in, 1670, by, geminiano, montanari, the, name, algol, means, demon, star, from, arabic, al, gh, l, which, was, probably, given, due, to, its, peculiar, behavior, another, visible, ternary, is, alpha, centauri, in, the, southern, constellation, of, centaurus, which, contains, the, third, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, with, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, of, 0, 01, this, system, also, underscores, the, fact, that, no, search, for, habitable, planets, is, complete, if, binaries, are, discounted, alpha, centauri, a, and, b, have, an, 11, au, distance, at, closest, approach, and, both, should, have, stable, habitable, zones, there, are, also, examples, of, systems, beyond, ternaries, castor, is, a, sextuple, star, system, which, is, the, second, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, gemini, and, one, of, the, brightest, stars, in, the, nighttime, sky, astronomically, castor, was, discovered, to, be, a, visual, binary, in, 1719, each, of, the, components, of, castor, is, itself, a, spectroscopic, binary,
