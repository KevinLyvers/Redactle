in, particle, physics, and, physical, cosmology, planck, units, are, a, system, of, units, of, measurement, defined, exclusively, in, terms, of, four, universal, physical, constants, c, g, and, k, b, described, further, below, expressing, one, of, these, physical, constants, in, terms, of, planck, units, yields, a, numerical, value, of, 1, they, are, a, system, of, natural, units, defined, using, fundamental, properties, of, nature, specifically, properties, of, free, space, rather, than, properties, of, a, chosen, prototype, object, originally, proposed, in, 1899, by, german, physicist, max, planck, they, are, relevant, in, research, on, unified, theories, such, as, quantum, gravity, the, term, planck, scale, refers, to, quantities, of, space, time, energy, and, other, units, that, are, similar, in, magnitude, to, corresponding, planck, units, this, region, may, be, characterized, by, particle, energies, of, around, 10, 19, gev, or, 10, 9, j, time, intervals, of, around, 5, 10, 44, s, and, lengths, of, around, 10, 35, m, approximately, the, energy, equivalent, of, the, planck, mass, the, planck, time, and, the, planck, length, respectively, at, the, planck, scale, the, predictions, of, the, standard, model, quantum, field, theory, and, general, relativity, are, not, expected, to, apply, and, quantum, effects, of, gravity, are, expected, to, dominate, one, example, is, represented, by, the, conditions, in, the, first, 10, 43, seconds, of, our, universe, after, the, big, bang, approximately, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, the, four, universal, constants, that, by, definition, have, a, numeric, value, 1, when, expressed, in, these, units, are, variants, of, the, basic, idea, of, planck, units, exist, such, as, alternate, choices, of, normalization, that, give, other, numeric, values, to, one, or, more, of, the, four, constants, above, any, system, of, measurement, may, be, assigned, a, mutually, independent, set, of, base, quantities, and, associated, base, units, from, which, all, other, quantities, and, units, may, be, derived, in, the, international, system, of, units, for, example, the, si, base, quantities, include, length, with, the, associated, unit, of, the, metre, in, the, system, of, planck, units, a, similar, set, of, base, quantities, and, associated, units, may, be, selected, in, terms, of, which, other, quantities, and, coherent, units, may, be, expressed, 1215, the, planck, unit, of, length, has, become, known, as, the, planck, length, and, the, planck, unit, of, time, is, known, as, the, planck, time, but, this, nomenclature, has, not, been, established, as, extending, to, all, quantities, all, planck, units, are, derived, from, the, dimensional, universal, physical, constants, that, define, the, system, and, in, a, convention, in, which, these, units, are, omitted, i, e, treated, as, having, the, dimensionless, value, 1, these, constants, are, then, eliminated, from, equations, of, physics, in, which, they, appear, for, example, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, can, be, expressed, as, both, equations, are, dimensionally, consistent, and, equally, valid, in, any, system, of, quantities, but, the, second, equation, with, g, absent, is, relating, only, dimensionless, quantities, since, any, ratio, of, two, like, dimensioned, quantities, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, if, by, a, shorthand, convention, it, is, understood, that, each, physical, quantity, is, the, corresponding, ratio, with, a, coherent, planck, unit, or, expressed, in, planck, units, the, ratios, above, may, be, expressed, simply, with, the, symbols, of, physical, quantity, without, being, scaled, explicitly, by, their, corresponding, unit, this, last, equation, without, g, is, valid, with, f, m, 1, m, 2, and, r, being, the, dimensionless, ratio, quantities, corresponding, to, the, standard, quantities, written, e, g, f, f, or, f, f, f, p, but, not, as, a, direct, equality, of, quantities, this, may, seem, to, be, setting, the, constants, c, g, etc, to, 1, if, the, correspondence, of, the, quantities, is, thought, of, as, equality, for, this, reason, planck, or, other, natural, units, should, be, employed, with, care, referring, to, g, c, 1, paul, s, wesson, wrote, that, mathematically, it, is, an, acceptable, trick, which, saves, labour, physically, it, represents, a, loss, of, information, and, can, lead, to, confusion, the, concept, of, natural, units, was, introduced, in, 1874, when, george, johnstone, stoney, noting, that, electric, charge, is, quantized, derived, units, of, length, time, and, mass, now, named, stoney, units, in, his, honor, stoney, chose, his, units, so, that, g, c, and, the, electron, charge, e, would, be, numerically, equal, to, 1, in, 1899, one, year, before, the, advent, of, quantum, theory, max, planck, introduced, what, became, later, known, as, the, planck, constant, at, the, end, of, the, paper, he, proposed, the, base, units, that, were, later, named, in, his, honor, the, planck, units, are, based, on, the, quantum, of, action, now, usually, known, as, the, planck, constant, which, appeared, in, the, wien, approximation, for, black, body, radiation, planck, underlined, the, universality, of, the, new, unit, system, writing, die, m, glichkeit, gegeben, ist, einheiten, f, r, l, nge, masse, zeit, und, temperatur, aufzustellen, welche, unabh, ngig, von, speciellen, k, rpern, oder, substanzen, ihre, bedeutung, f, r, alle, zeiten, und, f, r, alle, auch, ausserirdische, und, aussermenschliche, culturen, nothwendig, behalten, und, welche, daher, als, nat, rliche, maasseinheiten, bezeichnet, werden, k, nnen, it, is, possible, to, set, up, units, for, length, mass, time, and, temperature, which, are, independent, of, special, bodies, or, substances, necessarily, retaining, their, meaning, for, all, times, and, for, all, civilizations, including, extraterrestrial, and, non, human, ones, which, can, be, called, natural, units, of, measure, planck, considered, only, the, units, based, on, the, universal, constants, g, displaystyle, g, h, displaystyle, h, c, displaystyle, c, and, k, b, displaystyle, k, rm, b, to, arrive, at, natural, units, for, length, time, mass, and, temperature, his, definitions, differ, from, the, modern, ones, by, a, factor, of, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, pi, because, the, modern, definitions, use, displaystyle, hbar, rather, than, h, displaystyle, h, unlike, the, case, with, the, international, system, of, units, there, is, no, official, entity, that, establishes, a, definition, of, a, planck, unit, system, some, authors, define, the, base, planck, units, to, be, those, of, mass, length, and, time, regarding, an, additional, unit, for, temperature, to, be, redundant, other, tabulations, add, in, addition, to, a, unit, for, temperature, a, unit, for, electric, charge, so, that, the, coulomb, constant, k, e, displaystyle, k, text, e, is, added, to, the, list, of, constants, used, by, planck, thus, this, charge, unit, is, typically, given, by, q, p, 4, 0, c, 1, 875546, 10, 18, c, 11, 7, e, displaystyle, q, text, p, sqrt, 4, pi, epsilon, 0, hbar, c, approx, 1, 875546, times, 10, 18, text, c, approx, 11, 7, e, in, si, units, the, values, of, c, h, e, and, k, b, are, exact, and, the, values, of, 0, and, g, in, si, units, respectively, have, relative, uncertainties, of, 1, 6, 10, 10, and, 2, 2, 10, 5, hence, the, uncertainties, in, the, si, values, of, the, planck, units, derive, almost, entirely, from, uncertainty, in, the, si, value, of, g, compared, to, stoney, units, planck, base, units, are, all, larger, by, a, factor, 1, 11, 7, textstyle, sqrt, 1, alpha, approx, 11, 7, where, displaystyle, alpha, is, the, fine, structure, constant, in, any, system, of, measurement, units, for, many, physical, quantities, can, be, derived, from, base, units, table, 2, offers, a, sample, of, derived, planck, units, some, of, which, are, seldom, used, as, with, the, base, units, their, use, is, mostly, confined, to, theoretical, physics, because, most, of, them, are, too, large, or, too, small, for, empirical, or, practical, use, and, there, are, large, uncertainties, in, their, values, some, planck, units, such, as, of, time, and, length, are, many, orders, of, magnitude, too, large, or, too, small, to, be, of, practical, use, so, that, planck, units, as, a, system, are, typically, only, relevant, to, theoretical, physics, in, some, cases, a, planck, unit, may, suggest, a, limit, to, a, range, of, a, physical, quantity, where, present, day, theories, of, physics, apply, for, example, our, understanding, of, the, big, bang, does, not, extend, to, the, planck, epoch, i, e, when, the, universe, was, less, than, one, planck, time, old, describing, the, universe, during, the, planck, epoch, requires, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, that, would, incorporate, quantum, effects, into, general, relativity, such, a, theory, does, not, yet, exist, several, quantities, are, not, extreme, in, magnitude, such, as, the, planck, mass, which, is, about, 22, micrograms, very, large, in, comparison, with, subatomic, particles, and, within, the, mass, range, of, living, organisms, 872, similarly, the, related, units, of, energy, and, of, momentum, are, in, the, range, of, some, everyday, phenomena, planck, units, have, little, anthropocentric, arbitrariness, but, do, still, involve, some, arbitrary, choices, in, terms, of, the, defining, constants, unlike, the, metre, and, second, which, exist, as, base, units, in, the, si, system, for, historical, reasons, the, planck, length, and, planck, time, are, conceptually, linked, at, a, fundamental, physical, level, consequently, natural, units, help, physicists, to, reframe, questions, frank, wilczek, puts, it, succinctly, we, see, that, the, question, is, not, why, is, gravity, so, feeble, but, rather, why, is, the, proton, s, mass, so, small, for, in, natural, planck, units, the, strength, of, gravity, simply, is, what, it, is, a, primary, quantity, while, the, proton, s, mass, is, the, tiny, number, 1, 13, quintillion, while, it, is, true, that, the, electrostatic, repulsive, force, between, two, protons, alone, in, free, space, greatly, exceeds, the, gravitational, attractive, force, between, the, same, two, protons, this, is, not, about, the, relative, strengths, of, the, two, fundamental, forces, from, the, point, of, view, of, planck, units, this, is, comparing, apples, with, oranges, because, mass, and, electric, charge, are, incommensurable, quantities, rather, the, disparity, of, magnitude, of, force, is, a, manifestation, of, that, the, proton, charge, is, approximately, the, unit, charge, but, the, proton, mass, is, far, less, than, the, unit, mass, in, a, system, that, treats, both, forces, as, having, the, same, form, when, planck, proposed, his, units, the, goal, was, only, that, of, establishing, a, universal, natural, way, of, measuring, objects, without, giving, any, special, meaning, to, quantities, that, measured, one, single, unit, however, in, 1959, c, a, mead, showed, that, distances, that, measured, of, the, order, of, one, planck, length, or, similarly, times, that, measured, of, the, order, of, planck, time, did, carry, special, implications, related, to, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, an, analysis, of, the, effect, of, gravitation, on, hypothetical, experiments, indicates, that, it, is, impossible, to, measure, the, position, of, a, particle, with, error, less, than, 1, 6, 10, 33, cm, where, is, the, gravitational, constant, in, natural, units, a, similar, limitation, applies, to, the, precise, synchronization, of, clocks, in, particle, physics, and, physical, cosmology, the, planck, scale, is, an, energy, scale, around, 1, 22, 10, 28, ev, the, planck, energy, corresponding, to, the, energy, equivalent, of, the, planck, mass, 2, 176, 45, 10, 8, kg, at, which, quantum, effects, of, gravity, become, significant, at, this, scale, present, descriptions, and, theories, of, sub, atomic, particle, interactions, in, terms, of, quantum, field, theory, break, down, and, become, inadequate, due, to, the, impact, of, the, apparent, non, renormalizability, of, gravity, within, current, theories, at, the, planck, length, scale, the, strength, of, gravity, is, expected, to, become, comparable, with, the, other, forces, and, it, has, been, theorized, that, all, the, fundamental, forces, are, unified, at, that, scale, but, the, exact, mechanism, of, this, unification, remains, unknown, the, planck, scale, is, therefore, the, point, at, which, the, effects, of, quantum, gravity, can, no, longer, be, ignored, in, other, fundamental, interactions, where, current, calculations, and, approaches, begin, to, break, down, and, a, means, to, take, account, of, its, impact, is, necessary, on, these, grounds, it, has, been, speculated, that, it, may, be, an, approximate, lower, limit, at, which, a, black, hole, could, be, formed, by, collapse, while, physicists, have, a, fairly, good, understanding, of, the, other, fundamental, interactions, of, forces, on, the, quantum, level, gravity, is, problematic, and, cannot, be, integrated, with, quantum, mechanics, at, very, high, energies, using, the, usual, framework, of, quantum, field, theory, at, lesser, energy, levels, it, is, usually, ignored, while, for, energies, approaching, or, exceeding, the, planck, scale, a, new, theory, of, quantum, gravity, is, necessary, approaches, to, this, problem, include, string, theory, and, m, theory, loop, quantum, gravity, noncommutative, geometry, and, causal, set, theory, in, big, bang, cosmology, the, planck, epoch, or, planck, era, is, the, earliest, stage, of, the, big, bang, before, the, time, passed, was, equal, to, the, planck, time, t, p, or, approximately, 10, 43, seconds, there, is, no, currently, available, physical, theory, to, describe, such, short, times, and, it, is, not, clear, in, what, sense, the, concept, of, time, is, meaningful, for, values, smaller, than, the, planck, time, it, is, generally, assumed, that, quantum, effects, of, gravity, dominate, physical, interactions, at, this, time, scale, at, this, scale, the, unified, force, of, the, standard, model, is, assumed, to, be, unified, with, gravitation, immeasurably, hot, and, dense, the, state, of, the, planck, epoch, was, succeeded, by, the, grand, unification, epoch, where, gravitation, is, separated, from, the, unified, force, of, the, standard, model, in, turn, followed, by, the, inflationary, epoch, which, ended, after, about, 10, 32, seconds, or, about, 10, 11, t, p, table, 3, lists, properties, of, the, observable, universe, today, expressed, in, planck, units, after, the, measurement, of, the, cosmological, constant, in, 1998, estimated, at, 10, 122, in, planck, units, it, was, noted, that, this, is, suggestively, close, to, the, reciprocal, of, the, age, of, the, universe, t, squared, barrow, and, shaw, proposed, a, modified, theory, in, which, is, a, field, evolving, in, such, a, way, that, its, value, remains, t, 2, throughout, the, history, of, the, universe, the, planck, length, denoted, p, is, a, unit, of, length, defined, as, p, g, c, 3, displaystyle, ell, mathrm, p, sqrt, frac, hbar, g, c, 3, it, is, equal, to, 1, 616, 255, 18, 10, 35, m, the, two, digits, enclosed, by, parentheses, are, the, estimated, standard, error, associated, with, the, reported, numerical, value, or, about, 10, 20, times, the, diameter, of, a, proton, it, can, be, motivated, in, various, ways, such, as, considering, a, particle, whose, reduced, compton, wavelength, is, comparable, to, its, schwarzschild, radius, though, whether, those, concepts, are, in, fact, simultaneously, applicable, is, open, to, debate, the, same, heuristic, argument, simultaneously, motivates, the, planck, mass, the, planck, length, is, a, distance, scale, of, interest, in, speculations, about, quantum, gravity, the, bekenstein, hawking, entropy, of, a, black, hole, is, one, fourth, the, area, of, its, event, horizon, in, units, of, planck, length, squared, 370, since, the, 1950s, it, has, been, conjectured, that, quantum, fluctuations, of, the, spacetime, metric, might, make, the, familiar, notion, of, distance, inapplicable, below, the, planck, length, this, is, sometimes, expressed, by, saying, that, spacetime, becomes, a, foam, at, the, planck, scale, it, is, possible, that, the, planck, length, is, the, shortest, physically, measurable, distance, since, any, attempt, to, investigate, the, possible, existence, of, shorter, distances, by, performing, higher, energy, collisions, would, result, in, black, hole, production, higher, energy, collisions, rather, than, splitting, matter, into, finer, pieces, would, simply, produce, bigger, black, holes, the, strings, of, string, theory, are, modeled, to, be, on, the, order, of, the, planck, length, in, theories, with, large, extra, dimensions, the, planck, length, calculated, from, the, observed, value, of, g, displaystyle, g, can, be, smaller, than, the, true, fundamental, planck, length, 61, the, planck, time, t, p, is, the, time, required, for, light, to, travel, a, distance, of, 1, planck, length, in, vacuum, which, is, a, time, interval, of, approximately, 5, 39, 10, 44, s, no, current, physical, theory, can, describe, timescales, shorter, than, the, planck, time, such, as, the, earliest, events, after, the, big, bang, some, conjectures, state, that, the, structure, of, time, need, not, remain, smooth, on, intervals, comparable, to, the, planck, time, the, planck, energy, e, p, is, approximately, equal, to, the, energy, released, in, the, combustion, of, the, fuel, in, an, automobile, fuel, tank, 57, 2, l, at, 34, 2, mj, l, of, chemical, energy, the, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, ray, observed, in, 1991, had, a, measured, energy, of, about, 50, j, equivalent, to, about, 2, 5, 10, 8, e, p, proposals, for, theories, of, doubly, special, relativity, posit, that, in, addition, to, the, speed, of, light, an, energy, scale, is, also, invariant, for, all, inertial, observers, typically, this, energy, scale, is, chosen, to, be, the, planck, energy, the, planck, unit, of, force, may, be, thought, of, as, the, derived, unit, of, force, in, the, planck, system, if, the, planck, units, of, time, length, and, mass, are, considered, to, be, base, units, f, p, m, p, c, t, p, c, 4, g, 1, 2103, 10, 44, n, displaystyle, f, text, p, frac, m, text, p, c, t, text, p, frac, c, 4, g, approx, mathrm, 1, 2103, times, 10, 44, n, it, is, the, gravitational, attractive, force, of, two, bodies, of, 1, planck, mass, each, that, are, held, 1, planck, length, apart, one, convention, for, the, planck, charge, is, to, choose, it, so, that, the, electrostatic, repulsion, of, two, objects, with, planck, charge, and, mass, that, are, held, 1, planck, length, apart, balances, the, newtonian, attraction, between, them, some, authors, have, argued, that, the, planck, force, is, on, the, order, of, the, maximum, force, that, can, occur, between, two, bodies, however, the, validity, of, these, conjectures, has, been, disputed, the, planck, temperature, t, p, is, 1, 416, 784, 16, 10, 32, k, at, this, temperature, the, wavelength, of, light, emitted, by, thermal, radiation, reaches, the, planck, length, there, are, no, known, physical, models, able, to, describe, temperatures, greater, than, t, p, a, quantum, theory, of, gravity, would, be, required, to, model, the, extreme, energies, attained, hypothetically, a, system, in, thermal, equilibrium, at, the, planck, temperature, might, contain, planck, scale, black, holes, constantly, being, formed, from, thermal, radiation, and, decaying, via, hawking, evaporation, adding, energy, to, such, a, system, might, decrease, its, temperature, by, creating, larger, black, holes, whose, hawking, temperature, is, lower, physical, quantities, that, have, different, dimensions, such, as, time, and, length, cannot, be, equated, even, if, they, are, numerically, equal, e, g, 1, second, is, not, the, same, as, 1, metre, in, theoretical, physics, however, this, scruple, may, be, set, aside, by, a, process, called, nondimensionalization, the, effective, result, is, that, many, fundamental, equations, of, physics, which, often, include, some, of, the, constants, used, to, define, planck, units, become, equations, where, these, constants, are, replaced, by, a, 1, examples, include, the, energy, momentum, relation, e, 2, mc, 2, 2, pc, 2, which, becomes, e, 2, m, 2, p, 2, and, the, dirac, equation, i, mc, 0, which, becomes, i, m, 0, as, already, stated, above, planck, units, are, derived, by, normalizing, the, numerical, values, of, certain, fundamental, constants, to, 1, these, normalizations, are, neither, the, only, ones, possible, nor, necessarily, the, best, moreover, the, choice, of, what, factors, to, normalize, among, the, factors, appearing, in, the, fundamental, equations, of, physics, is, not, evident, and, the, values, of, the, planck, units, are, sensitive, to, this, choice, the, factor, 4, is, ubiquitous, in, theoretical, physics, because, in, three, dimensional, space, the, surface, area, of, a, sphere, of, radius, r, is, 4, r, 2, this, along, with, the, concept, of, flux, are, the, basis, for, the, inverse, square, law, gauss, s, law, and, the, divergence, operator, applied, to, flux, density, for, example, gravitational, and, electrostatic, fields, produced, by, point, objects, have, spherical, symmetry, and, so, the, electric, flux, through, a, sphere, of, radius, r, around, a, point, charge, will, be, distributed, uniformly, over, that, sphere, from, this, it, follows, that, a, factor, of, 4, r, 2, will, appear, in, the, denominator, of, coulomb, s, law, in, rationalized, form, 214, 15, both, the, numerical, factor, and, the, power, of, the, dependence, on, r, would, change, if, space, were, higher, dimensional, the, correct, expressions, can, be, deduced, from, the, geometry, of, higher, dimensional, spheres, 51, likewise, for, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, a, factor, of, 4, naturally, appears, in, poisson, s, equation, when, relating, the, gravitational, potential, to, the, distribution, of, matter, 56, hence, a, substantial, body, of, physical, theory, developed, since, planck, s, 1899, paper, suggests, normalizing, not, g, but, 4, g, or, 8, g, to, 1, doing, so, would, introduce, a, factor, of, 1, 4, or, 1, 8, into, the, nondimensionalized, form, of, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, consistent, with, the, modern, rationalized, formulation, of, coulomb, s, law, in, terms, of, the, vacuum, permittivity, in, fact, alternative, normalizations, frequently, preserve, the, factor, of, 1, 4, in, the, nondimensionalized, form, of, coulomb, s, law, as, well, so, that, the, nondimensionalized, maxwell, s, equations, for, electromagnetism, and, gravitoelectromagnetism, both, take, the, same, form, as, those, for, electromagnetism, in, si, which, do, not, have, any, factors, of, 4, when, this, is, applied, to, electromagnetic, constants, 0, this, unit, system, is, called, rationalized, when, applied, additionally, to, gravitation, and, planck, units, these, are, called, rationalized, planck, units, and, are, seen, in, high, energy, physics, the, rationalized, planck, units, are, defined, so, that, c, 4, g, 0, k, b, 1, there, are, several, possible, alternative, normalizations, in, 1899, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, was, still, seen, as, exact, rather, than, as, a, convenient, approximation, holding, for, small, velocities, and, masses, the, approximate, nature, of, newton, s, law, was, shown, following, the, development, of, general, relativity, in, 1915, hence, planck, normalized, to, 1, the, gravitational, constant, g, in, newton, s, law, in, theories, emerging, after, 1899, g, nearly, always, appears, in, formulae, multiplied, by, 4, or, a, small, integer, multiple, thereof, hence, a, choice, to, be, made, when, designing, a, system, of, natural, units, is, which, if, any, instances, of, 4, appearing, in, the, equations, of, physics, are, to, be, eliminated, via, the, normalization
