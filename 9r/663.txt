a, dune, is, a, landform, composed, of, wind, or, water, driven, sand, it, typically, takes, the, form, of, a, mound, ridge, or, hill, an, area, with, dunes, is, called, a, dune, system, or, a, dune, complex, a, large, dune, complex, is, called, a, dune, field, while, broad, flat, regions, covered, with, wind, swept, sand, or, dunes, with, little, or, no, vegetation, are, called, ergs, or, sand, seas, dunes, occur, in, different, shapes, and, sizes, but, most, kinds, of, dunes, are, longer, on, the, stoss, upflow, side, where, the, sand, is, pushed, up, the, dune, and, have, a, shorter, slip, face, in, the, lee, side, the, valley, or, trough, between, dunes, is, called, a, dune, slack, dunes, are, most, common, in, desert, environments, where, the, lack, of, moisture, hinders, the, growth, of, vegetation, that, would, otherwise, interfere, with, the, development, of, dunes, however, sand, deposits, are, not, restricted, to, deserts, and, dunes, are, also, found, along, sea, shores, along, streams, in, semiarid, climates, in, areas, of, glacial, outwash, and, in, other, areas, where, poorly, cemented, sandstone, bedrock, disintegrates, to, produce, an, ample, supply, of, loose, sand, subaqueous, dunes, can, form, from, the, action, of, water, flow, fluvial, processes, on, sand, or, gravel, beds, of, rivers, estuaries, and, the, sea, bed, some, coastal, areas, have, one, or, more, sets, of, dunes, running, parallel, to, the, shoreline, directly, inland, from, the, beach, in, most, cases, the, dunes, are, important, in, protecting, the, land, against, potential, ravages, by, storm, waves, from, the, sea, artificial, dunes, are, sometimes, constructed, to, protect, coastal, areas, the, dynamic, action, of, wind, and, water, can, sometimes, cause, dunes, to, drift, which, can, have, serious, consequences, for, example, the, town, of, eucla, western, australia, had, to, be, relocated, in, the, 1890s, because, of, dune, drift, the, modern, word, dune, came, into, english, from, french, around, 1790, which, in, turn, came, from, middle, dutch, d, ne, a, universally, precise, distinction, does, not, exist, between, ripples, dunes, and, draas, which, are, all, deposits, of, the, same, type, of, materials, dunes, are, generally, defined, as, greater, than, 7, cm, tall, and, may, have, ripples, while, ripples, are, deposits, that, are, less, than, 3, cm, tall, a, draa, is, a, very, large, aeolian, landform, with, a, length, of, several, kilometers, and, a, height, of, tens, to, hundreds, of, meters, and, which, may, have, superimposed, dunes, dunes, are, made, of, sand, sized, particles, and, may, consist, of, quartz, calcium, carbonate, snow, gypsum, or, other, materials, the, upwind, upstream, upcurrent, side, of, the, dune, is, called, the, stoss, side, the, downflow, side, is, called, the, lee, side, sand, is, pushed, creep, or, bounces, saltation, up, the, stoss, side, and, slides, down, the, lee, side, a, side, of, a, dune, that, the, sand, has, slid, down, is, called, a, slip, face, or, slipface, the, bagnold, formula, gives, the, speed, at, which, particles, can, be, transported, five, basic, dune, types, are, recognized, crescentic, linear, star, dome, and, parabolic, dune, areas, may, occur, in, three, forms, simple, isolated, dunes, of, basic, type, compound, larger, dunes, on, which, smaller, dunes, of, same, type, form, and, complex, combinations, of, different, types, barchan, dunes, are, crescent, shaped, mounds, which, are, generally, wider, than, they, are, long, the, lee, side, slipfaces, are, on, the, concave, sides, of, the, dunes, these, dunes, form, under, winds, that, blow, consistently, from, one, direction, unimodal, winds, they, form, separate, crescents, when, the, sand, supply, is, comparatively, small, when, the, sand, supply, is, greater, they, may, merge, into, barchanoid, ridges, and, then, transverse, dunes, see, below, some, types, of, crescentic, dunes, move, more, quickly, over, desert, surfaces, than, any, other, type, of, dune, a, group, of, dunes, moved, more, than, 100, metres, per, year, between, 1954, and, 1959, in, china, s, ningxia, province, and, similar, speeds, have, been, recorded, in, the, western, desert, of, egypt, the, largest, crescentic, dunes, on, earth, with, mean, crest, to, crest, widths, of, more, than, three, kilometres, are, in, china, s, taklamakan, desert, abundant, barchan, dunes, may, merge, into, barchanoid, ridges, which, then, grade, into, linear, or, slightly, sinuous, transverse, dunes, so, called, because, they, lie, transverse, or, across, the, wind, direction, with, the, wind, blowing, perpendicular, to, the, ridge, crest, seif, dunes, are, linear, or, slightly, sinuous, dunes, with, two, slip, faces, the, two, slip, faces, make, them, sharp, crested, they, are, called, seif, dunes, after, the, arabic, word, for, sword, they, may, be, more, than, 160, kilometres, 100, miles, long, and, thus, easily, visible, in, satellite, images, see, illustrations, seif, dunes, are, associated, with, bidirectional, winds, the, long, axes, and, ridges, of, these, dunes, extend, along, the, resultant, direction, of, sand, movement, hence, the, name, longitudinal, some, linear, dunes, merge, to, form, y, shaped, compound, dunes, formation, is, debated, ralph, bagnold, in, the, physics, of, blown, sand, and, desert, dunes, suggested, that, some, seif, dunes, form, when, a, barchan, dune, moves, into, a, bidirectional, wind, regime, and, one, arm, or, wing, of, the, crescent, elongates, others, suggest, that, seif, dunes, are, formed, by, vortices, in, a, unidirectional, wind, in, the, sheltered, troughs, between, highly, developed, seif, dunes, barchans, may, be, formed, because, the, wind, is, constrained, to, be, unidirectional, by, the, dunes, seif, dunes, are, common, in, the, sahara, they, range, up, to, 300, m, 980, ft, in, height, and, 300, km, 190, mi, in, length, in, the, southern, third, of, the, arabian, peninsula, a, vast, erg, called, the, rub, al, khali, or, empty, quarter, contains, seif, dunes, that, stretch, for, almost, 200, km, 120, mi, and, reach, heights, of, over, 300, m, 980, ft, linear, loess, hills, known, as, pahas, are, superficially, similar, these, hills, appear, to, have, been, formed, during, the, last, ice, age, under, permafrost, conditions, dominated, by, sparse, tundra, vegetation, star, dunes, are, pyramidal, sand, mounds, with, slipfaces, on, three, or, more, arms, that, radiate, from, the, high, center, of, the, mound, they, tend, to, accumulate, in, areas, with, multidirectional, wind, regimes, star, dunes, grow, upward, rather, than, laterally, they, dominate, the, grand, erg, oriental, of, the, sahara, in, other, deserts, they, occur, around, the, margins, of, the, sand, seas, particularly, near, topographic, barriers, in, the, southeast, badain, jaran, desert, of, china, the, star, dunes, are, up, to, 500, metres, tall, and, may, be, the, tallest, dunes, on, earth, oval, or, circular, mounds, that, generally, lack, a, slipface, dome, dunes, are, rare, and, occur, at, the, far, upwind, margins, of, sand, seas, fixed, crescentic, dunes, that, form, on, the, leeward, margins, of, playas, and, river, valleys, in, arid, and, semiarid, regions, in, response, to, the, direction, s, of, prevailing, winds, are, known, as, lunettes, source, bordering, dunes, bourrelets, and, clay, dunes, they, may, be, composed, of, clay, silt, sand, or, gypsum, eroded, from, the, basin, floor, or, shore, transported, up, the, concave, side, of, the, dune, and, deposited, on, the, convex, side, examples, in, australia, are, up, to, 6, 5, km, long, 1, km, wide, and, up, to, 50, metres, high, they, also, occur, in, southern, and, west, africa, and, in, parts, of, the, western, united, states, especially, texas, u, shaped, mounds, of, sand, with, convex, noses, trailed, by, elongated, arms, are, parabolic, dunes, these, dunes, are, formed, from, blowout, dunes, where, the, erosion, of, vegetated, sand, leads, to, a, u, shaped, depression, the, elongated, arms, are, held, in, place, by, vegetation, the, largest, arm, known, on, earth, reaches, 12, km, sometimes, these, dunes, are, called, u, shaped, blowout, or, hairpin, dunes, and, they, are, well, known, in, coastal, deserts, unlike, crescent, shaped, dunes, their, crests, point, upwind, the, bulk, of, the, sand, in, the, dune, migrates, forward, in, plan, view, these, are, u, shaped, or, v, shaped, mounds, of, well, sorted, very, fine, to, medium, sand, with, elongated, arms, that, extend, upwind, behind, the, central, part, of, the, dune, there, are, slipfaces, that, often, occur, on, the, outer, side, of, the, nose, and, on, the, outer, slopes, of, the, arms, these, dunes, often, occur, in, semiarid, areas, where, the, precipitation, is, retained, in, the, lower, parts, of, the, dune, and, underlying, soils, the, stability, of, the, dunes, was, once, attributed, to, the, vegetative, cover, but, recent, research, has, pointed, to, water, as, the, main, source, of, parabolic, dune, stability, the, vegetation, that, covers, them, grasses, shrubs, and, trees, help, anchor, the, trailing, arms, in, inland, deserts, parabolic, dunes, commonly, originate, and, extend, downwind, from, blowouts, in, sand, sheets, only, partly, anchored, by, vegetation, they, can, also, originate, from, beach, sands, and, extend, inland, into, vegetated, areas, in, coastal, zones, and, on, shores, of, large, lakes, most, parabolic, dunes, do, not, reach, heights, higher, than, a, few, tens, of, metres, except, at, their, nose, where, vegetation, stops, or, slows, the, advance, of, accumulating, sand, simple, parabolic, dunes, have, only, one, set, of, arms, that, trail, upwind, behind, the, leading, nose, compound, parabolic, dunes, are, coalesced, features, with, several, sets, of, trailing, arms, complex, parabolic, dunes, include, subsidiary, superposed, or, coalesced, forms, usually, of, barchanoid, or, linear, shapes, parabolic, dunes, like, crescent, dunes, occur, in, areas, where, very, strong, winds, are, mostly, unidirectional, although, these, dunes, are, found, in, areas, now, characterized, by, variable, wind, speeds, the, effective, winds, associated, with, the, growth, and, migration, of, both, the, parabolic, and, crescent, dunes, probably, are, the, most, consistent, in, wind, direction, the, grain, size, for, these, well, sorted, very, fine, to, medium, sands, is, about, 0, 06, to, 0, 5, mm, parabolic, dunes, have, loose, sand, and, steep, slopes, only, on, their, outer, flanks, the, inner, slopes, are, mostly, well, packed, and, anchored, by, vegetation, as, are, the, corridors, between, individual, dunes, because, all, dune, arms, are, oriented, in, the, same, direction, and, the, inter, dune, corridors, are, generally, swept, clear, of, loose, sand, the, corridors, can, usually, be, traversed, in, between, the, trailing, arms, of, the, dune, however, to, cross, straight, over, the, dune, by, going, over, the, trailing, arms, can, be, very, difficult, also, traversing, the, nose, is, very, difficult, as, well, because, the, nose, is, usually, made, up, of, loose, sand, without, much, if, any, vegetation, a, type, of, extensive, parabolic, dune, that, lacks, discernible, slipfaces, and, has, mostly, coarse, grained, sand, is, known, as, a, zibar, the, term, zibar, comes, from, the, arabic, word, to, describe, rolling, transverse, ridges, with, a, hard, surface, the, dunes, are, small, have, low, relief, and, can, be, found, in, many, places, across, the, planet, from, wyoming, united, states, to, saudi, arabia, to, australia, spacing, between, zibars, ranges, from, 50, to, 400, metres, and, they, do, not, become, more, than, 10, metres, high, the, dunes, form, at, about, ninety, degrees, to, the, prevailing, wind, which, blows, away, the, small, fine, grained, sand, leaving, behind, the, coarser, grained, sand, to, form, the, crest, occurring, wherever, winds, periodically, reverse, direction, reversing, dunes, are, varieties, of, any, of, the, above, shapes, these, dunes, typically, have, major, and, minor, slipfaces, oriented, in, opposite, directions, the, minor, slipfaces, are, usually, temporary, as, they, appear, after, a, reverse, wind, and, are, generally, destroyed, when, the, wind, next, blows, in, the, dominant, direction, draas, are, very, large, scale, dune, bedforms, they, may, be, tens, or, a, few, hundreds, of, metres, in, height, kilometres, wide, and, hundreds, of, kilometres, in, length, after, a, draa, has, reached, a, certain, size, it, generally, develops, superimposed, dune, forms, they, are, thought, to, be, more, ancient, and, slower, moving, than, smaller, dunes, and, to, form, by, vertical, growth, of, existing, dunes, draas, are, widespread, in, sand, seas, and, are, well, represented, in, the, geological, record, all, these, dune, shapes, may, occur, in, three, forms, simple, isolated, dunes, of, basic, type, compound, larger, dunes, on, which, smaller, dunes, of, same, type, form, and, complex, combinations, of, different, types, simple, dunes, are, basic, forms, with, the, minimum, number, of, slipfaces, that, define, the, geometric, type, compound, dunes, are, large, dunes, on, which, smaller, dunes, of, similar, type, and, slipface, orientation, are, superimposed, complex, dunes, are, combinations, of, two, or, more, dune, types, a, crescentic, dune, with, a, star, dune, superimposed, on, its, crest, is, the, most, common, complex, dune, simple, dunes, represent, a, wind, regime, that, has, not, changed, in, intensity, or, direction, since, the, formation, of, the, dune, while, compound, and, complex, dunes, suggest, that, the, intensity, and, direction, of, the, wind, has, changed, the, sand, mass, of, dunes, can, move, either, windward, or, leeward, depending, on, if, the, wind, is, making, contact, with, the, dune, from, below, or, above, its, apogee, if, wind, hits, from, above, the, sand, particles, move, leeward, the, leeward, flux, of, sand, is, greater, than, the, windward, flux, conversely, if, sand, hits, from, below, sand, particles, move, windward, further, if, the, wind, is, carrying, sand, particles, when, it, hits, the, dune, the, dune, s, sand, particles, will, saltate, more, than, if, the, wind, had, hit, the, dune, without, carrying, sand, particles, coastal, dunes, form, when, wet, sand, is, deposited, along, the, coast, and, dries, out, and, is, blown, along, the, beach, dunes, form, where, the, beach, is, wide, enough, to, allow, for, the, accumulation, of, wind, blown, sand, and, where, prevailing, onshore, winds, tend, to, blow, sand, inland, the, three, key, ingredients, for, coastal, dune, formation, are, a, large, sand, supply, winds, to, move, said, sand, supply, and, a, place, for, the, sand, supply, to, accumulate, obstacles, for, example, vegetation, pebbles, and, so, on, tend, to, slow, down, the, wind, and, lead, to, the, deposition, of, sand, grains, these, small, incipient, dunes, or, shadow, dunes, tend, to, grow, in, the, vertical, direction, if, the, obstacle, slowing, the, wind, can, also, grow, vertically, i, e, vegetation, coastal, dunes, expand, laterally, as, a, result, of, lateral, growth, of, coastal, plants, via, seed, or, rhizome, models, of, coastal, dunes, suggest, that, their, final, equilibrium, height, is, related, to, the, distance, between, the, water, line, and, where, vegetation, can, grow, coastal, dunes, can, be, classified, by, where, they, develop, or, begin, to, take, shape, dunes, are, commonly, grouped, into, either, the, primary, dune, group, or, the, secondary, dune, group, primary, dunes, gain, most, of, their, sand, from, the, beach, itself, while, secondary, dunes, gain, their, sand, from, the, primary, dune, along, the, florida, panhandle, most, dunes, are, considered, to, be, foredunes, or, hummocks, different, locations, around, the, globe, have, dune, formations, unique, to, their, given, coastal, profile, coastal, sand, dunes, can, provide, privacy, and, or, habitats, to, support, local, flora, and, fauna, animals, such, as, sand, snakes, lizards, and, rodents, can, live, in, coastal, sand, dunes, along, with, insects, of, all, types, often, the, vegetation, of, sand, dunes, is, discussed, without, acknowledging, the, importance, that, coastal, dunes, have, for, animals, further, some, animals, such, as, foxes, and, feral, pigs, can, use, coastal, dunes, as, hunting, grounds, to, find, food, birds, are, also, known, to, utilize, coastal, dunes, as, nesting, grounds, all, these, species, find, the, coastal, environment, of, the, sand, dune, vital, to, their, species, survival, over, the, course, of, time, coastal, dunes, may, be, impacted, by, tropical, cyclones, or, other, intense, storm, activity, dependent, on, their, location, recent, work, has, suggested, that, coastal, dunes, tend, to, evolve, toward, a, high, or, low, morphology, depending, on, the, growth, rate, of, dunes, relative, to, storm, frequency, during, a, storm, event, dunes, play, a, significant, role, in, minimizing, wave, energy, as, it, moves, onshore, as, a, result, coastal, dunes, especially, those, in, the, foredune, area, affected, by, a, storm, surge, will, retreat, or, erode, to, counteract, the, damage, from, tropical, activity, on, coastal, dunes, short, term, post, storm, efforts, can, be, made, by, individual, agencies, through, fencing, to, help, with, sand, accumulation, how, much, a, dune, erodes, during, any, storm, surge, is, related, to, its, location, on, the, coastal, shoreline, and, the, profile, of, the, beach, during, a, particular, season, in, those, areas, with, harsher, winter, weather, during, the, summer, a, beach, tends, to, take, on, more, of, a, convex, appearance, due, to, gentler, waves, while, the, same, beach, in, the, winter, may, take, on, more, of, a, concave, appearance, as, a, result, coastal, dunes, can, get, eroded, much, more, quickly, in, the, winter, than, in, the, summer, the, converse, is, true, in, areas, with, harsher, summer, weather, there, are, many, threats, to, these, coastal, communities, some, coastal, dunes, for, example, ones, in, san, francisco, have, been, completely, altered, by, urbanization, reshaping, the, dune, for, human, use, this, puts, native, species, at, risk, another, danger, in, california, and, places, in, the, uk, specifically, is, the, introduction, of, invasive, species, plant, species, such, as, carpobrotus, edulis, were, introduced, from, south, africa, in, an, attempt, to, stabilize, the, dunes, and, provide, horticultural, benefits, but, instead, spread, taking, land, away, from, native, species, ammophila, arenaria, known, as, european, beachgrass, has, a, similar, story, though, it, has, no, horticulture, benefits, it, has, great, ground, coverage, and, as, intended, stabilized, the, dunes, but, as, an, unintended, side, effect, prevented, native, species, from, thriving, in, those, dunes, one, such, example, is, the, dune, field, at, point, reyes, california, there, are, now, efforts, to, get, rid, of, both, of, these, invasive, species, as, a, dune, forms, plant, succession, occurs, the, conditions, on, an, embryo, dune, are, harsh, with, salt, spray, from, the, sea, carried, on, strong, winds, the, dune, is, well, drained, and, often, dry, and, composed, of, calcium, carbonate, from, seashells, rotting, seaweed, brought, in, by, storm, waves, adds, nutrients, to, allow, pioneer, species, to, colonize, the, dune, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, these, pioneer, species, are, often, marram, grass, sea, wort, grass, and, other, sea, grasses, these, plants, are, well, adapted, to, the, harsh, conditions, of, the, foredune, typically, having, deep, roots, which, reach, the, water, table, root, nodules, that, produce, nitrogen, compounds, and, protected, stoma, reducing, transpiration, also, the, deep, roots, bind, the, sand, together, and, the, dune, grows, into, a, foredune, as, more, sand, is, blown, over, the, grasses, the, grasses, add, nitrogen, to, the, soil, meaning, other, less, hardy, plants, can, then, colonize, the, dunes, typically, these, are, heather, heaths, and, gorses, these, too, are, adapted, to, the, low, soil, water, content, and, have, small, prickly, leaves, which, reduce, transpiration, heather, adds, humus, to, the, soil, and, is, usually, replaced, by, coniferous, trees, which, can, tolerate, low, soil, ph, caused, by, the, accumulation, and, decomposition, of, organic, matter, with, nitrate, leaching, coniferous, forests, and, heathland, are, common, climax, communities, for, sand, dune, systems, young, dunes, are, called, yellow, dunes, and, dunes, which, have, high, humus, content, are, called, grey, dunes, leaching, occurs, on, the, dunes, washing, humus, into, the, slacks, and, the, slacks, may, be, much, more, developed, than, the, exposed, tops, of, the, dunes, it, is, usually, in, the, slacks, that, more, rare, species, are, developed, and, there, is, a, tendency, for, the, dune, slacks, soil, to, be, waterlogged, where, only, marsh, plants, can, survive, in, europe, these, plants, include, creeping, willow, cotton, grass, yellow, iris, reeds, and, rushes, as, for, vertebrates, in, european, dunes, natterjack, toads, sometimes, breed, here, dune, ecosystems, are, extremely, difficult, places, for, plants, to, survive, this, is, due, to, a, number, of, pressures, related, to, their, proximity, to, the, ocean, and, confinement, to, growth, on, sandy, substrates, these, include, plants, have, evolved, many, adaptations, to, cope, with, these, pressures, in, deserts, where, large, amounts, of, limestone, mountains, surround, a, closed, basin, such, as, at, white, sands, national, park, in, south, central, new, mexico, occasional, storm, runoff, transports, dissolved, limestone, and, gypsum, into, a, low, lying, pan, within, the, basin, where, the, water, evaporates, depositing, the, gypsum, and, forming, crystals, known, as, selenite, the, crystals, left, behind, by, this, process, are, eroded, by, the, wind, and, deposited, as, vast, white, dune, fields, that, resemble, snow, covered, landscapes, these, types, of, dune, are, rare, and, only, form, in, closed, arid, basins, that, retain, the, highly, soluble, gypsum, that, would, otherwise, be, washed, into, the, sea, a, nabkha, or, coppice, dune, is, a, small, dune, anchored, by, vegetation, they, usually, indicate, desertification, or, soil, erosion, and, serve, as, nesting, and, burrow, sites, for, animals, sub, aqueous, underwater, dunes, form, on, a, bed, of, sand, or, gravel, under, the, actions, of, water, flow, they, are, ubiquitous, in, natural, channels, such, as, rivers, and, estuaries, and, also, form, in, engineered, canals, and, pipelines, dunes, move, downstream, as, the, upstream, slope, is, eroded, and, the, sediment, deposited, on, the, downstream, or, lee, slope, in, typical, bedform, construction, in, the, case, of, sub, aqueous, barchan, dunes, sediment, is, lost, by, their, extremities, known, as, horns, these, dunes, most, often, form, as, a, continuous, train, of, dunes, showing, remarkable, similarity, in, wavelength, and, height, the, shape, of, a, dune, gives, information, about, its, formation, environment, for, instance, rivers, produce, asymmetrical, ripples, with, the, steeper, slip, face, facing, downstream, ripple, marks, preserved, in, sedimentary, strata, in, the, geological, record, can, be, used, to, determine, the, direction, of, current, flow, and, thus, an, indication, of, the, source, of, the, sediments, dunes, on, the, bed, of, a, channel, significantly, increase, flow, resistance, their, presence, and, growth, playing, a, major, part, in, river, flooding, a, lithified, consolidated, sand, dune, is, a, type, of, sandstone, that, is, formed, when, a, marine, or, aeolian, sand, dune, becomes, compacted, and, hardened, once, in, this, form, water, passing, through, the, rock, can, carry, and, deposit, minerals, which, can, alter, the, colour, of, the, rock, cross, bedded, layers, of, stacks, of, lithified, dunes, can, produce, the, cross, hatching, patterns, such, as, those, seen, in, zion, national, park, in, the, western, united, states, a, slang, term, used, in, the, southwest, us, for, consolidated, and, hardened, sand, dunes, is, slickrock, a, name, that, was, introduced, by, pioneers, of, the, old, west, because, their, steel, rimmed, wagon, wheels, could, not, gain, traction, on, the, rock, sand, dunes, can, have, a, negative, impact, on, humans, when, they, encroach, on, human, habitats, sand, dunes, move, via, a, few, different, means, all, of, them, helped, along, by, wind, one, way, that, dunes, can, move, is, by, saltation, where, sand, particles, skip, along, the, ground, like, a, bouncing, ball, when, these, skipping, particles, land, they, may, knock, into, other, particles, and, cause, them, to, move, as, well, in, a, process, known, as, creep, with, slightly, stronger, winds, particles, collide, in, mid, air, causing, sheet, flows, in, a, major, dust, storm, dunes, may, move, tens, of, metres, through, such, sheet, flows, also, as, in, the, case, of, snow, sand, avalanches, falling, down, the, slipface, of, the, dunes, that, face, away, from, the, winds, also, move, the, dunes, forward, sand, threatens, buildings, and, crops, in, africa, the, middle, east, and, china, drenching, sand, dunes, with,
