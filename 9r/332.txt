a, metal, from, ancient, greek, m, tallon, mine, quarry, metal, is, a, material, that, when, polished, or, fractured, shows, a, lustrous, appearance, and, conducts, electricity, and, heat, relatively, well, these, properties, are, all, associated, with, having, electrons, available, at, the, fermi, level, as, against, nonmetallic, materials, which, do, not, chpt, 8, 19, chpt, 7, 8, metals, are, typically, ductile, can, be, drawn, into, wires, and, malleable, they, can, be, hammered, into, thin, sheets, a, metal, may, be, a, chemical, element, such, as, iron, an, alloy, such, as, stainless, steel, or, a, molecular, compound, such, as, polymeric, sulfur, nitride, the, general, science, of, metals, is, called, metallurgy, a, subtopic, of, materials, science, aspects, of, the, electronic, and, thermal, properties, are, also, within, the, scope, of, condensed, matter, physics, and, solid, state, chemistry, it, is, a, multidisciplinary, topic, in, colloquial, use, materials, such, as, steel, alloys, are, referred, to, as, metals, while, others, such, as, polymers, wood, or, ceramics, are, nonmetallic, materials, a, metal, conducts, electricity, at, a, temperature, of, absolute, zero, which, is, a, consequence, of, delocalized, states, at, the, fermi, energy, many, elements, and, compounds, become, metallic, under, high, pressures, for, example, iodine, gradually, becomes, a, metal, at, a, pressure, of, between, 40, and, 170, thousand, times, atmospheric, pressure, sodium, becomes, a, nonmetal, at, pressure, of, just, under, two, million, times, atmospheric, pressure, and, at, even, higher, pressures, it, is, expected, to, become, a, metal, again, when, discussing, the, periodic, table, and, some, chemical, properties, the, term, metal, is, often, used, to, denote, those, elements, which, in, pure, form, and, at, standard, conditions, are, metals, in, the, sense, of, electrical, conduction, mentioned, above, the, related, term, metallic, may, also, be, used, for, types, of, dopant, atoms, or, alloying, elements, in, astronomy, metal, refers, to, all, chemical, elements, in, a, star, that, are, heavier, than, helium, in, this, sense, the, first, four, metals, collecting, in, stellar, cores, through, nucleosynthesis, are, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and, neon, a, star, fuses, lighter, atoms, mostly, hydrogen, and, helium, into, heavier, atoms, over, its, lifetime, the, metallicity, of, an, astronomical, object, is, the, proportion, of, its, matter, made, up, of, the, heavier, chemical, elements, the, strength, and, resilience, of, some, metals, has, led, to, their, frequent, use, in, for, example, high, rise, building, and, bridge, construction, as, well, as, most, vehicles, many, home, appliances, tools, pipes, and, railroad, tracks, precious, metals, were, historically, used, as, coinage, but, in, the, modern, era, coinage, metals, have, extended, to, at, least, 23, of, the, chemical, elements, there, is, also, extensive, use, of, multi, element, metals, such, as, titanium, nitride, or, degenerate, semiconductors, in, the, semiconductor, industry, the, history, of, refined, metals, is, thought, to, begin, with, the, use, of, copper, about, 11, 000, years, ago, gold, silver, iron, as, meteoric, iron, lead, and, brass, were, likewise, in, use, before, the, first, known, appearance, of, bronze, in, the, fifth, millennium, bce, subsequent, developments, include, the, production, of, early, forms, of, steel, the, discovery, of, sodium, the, first, light, metal, in, 1809, the, rise, of, modern, alloy, steels, and, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, development, of, more, sophisticated, alloys, most, metals, are, shiny, and, lustrous, at, least, when, polished, or, fractured, sheets, of, metal, thicker, than, a, few, micrometres, appear, opaque, but, gold, leaf, transmits, green, light, this, is, due, to, the, freely, moving, electrons, which, reflect, light, although, most, elemental, metals, have, higher, densities, than, nonmetals, there, is, a, wide, variation, in, their, densities, lithium, being, the, least, dense, 0, 534, g, cm, 3, and, osmium, 22, 59, g, cm, 3, the, most, dense, some, of, the, 6d, transition, metals, are, expected, to, be, denser, than, osmium, but, their, known, isotopes, are, too, unstable, for, bulk, production, to, be, possible, magnesium, aluminium, and, titanium, are, light, metals, of, significant, commercial, importance, their, respective, densities, of, 1, 7, 2, 7, and, 4, 5, g, cm, 3, can, be, compared, to, those, of, the, older, structural, metals, like, iron, at, 7, 9, and, copper, at, 8, 9, g, cm, 3, the, most, common, lightweight, metals, are, aluminium, and, magnesium, alloys, metals, are, typically, malleable, and, ductile, deforming, under, stress, without, cleaving, the, nondirectional, nature, of, metallic, bonding, contributes, to, the, ductility, of, most, metallic, solids, where, the, peierls, stress, is, relatively, low, allowing, for, dislocation, motion, and, there, are, also, many, combinations, of, planes, and, directions, for, plastic, deformation, due, to, their, having, close, packed, arrangements, of, atoms, the, burgers, vector, of, the, dislocations, are, fairly, small, which, also, means, that, the, energy, needed, to, produce, one, is, small, in, contrast, in, an, ionic, compound, like, table, salt, the, burgers, vectors, are, much, larger, and, the, energy, to, move, a, dislocation, is, far, higher, reversible, elastic, deformation, in, metals, can, be, described, well, by, hooke, s, law, for, the, restoring, forces, where, the, stress, is, linearly, proportional, to, the, strain, a, temperature, change, may, lead, to, the, movement, of, structural, defects, in, the, metal, such, as, grain, boundaries, point, vacancies, line, and, screw, dislocations, stacking, faults, and, twins, in, both, crystalline, and, non, crystalline, metals, internal, slip, creep, and, metal, fatigue, may, also, ensue, the, atoms, of, simple, metallic, substances, are, often, in, one, of, three, common, crystal, structures, namely, body, centered, cubic, bcc, face, centered, cubic, fcc, and, hexagonal, close, packed, hcp, in, bcc, each, atom, is, positioned, at, the, center, of, a, cube, of, eight, others, in, fcc, and, hcp, each, atom, is, surrounded, by, twelve, others, but, the, stacking, of, the, layers, differs, some, metals, adopt, different, structures, depending, on, the, temperature, many, other, metals, with, different, elements, have, more, complicated, structures, such, as, rock, salt, structure, in, titanium, nitride, or, perovskite, structure, in, some, nickelates, the, electronic, structure, of, metals, means, they, are, relatively, good, conductors, of, electricity, the, electrons, all, have, different, momenta, which, average, to, zero, when, there, is, no, external, voltage, when, a, voltage, is, applied, some, move, a, little, faster, in, a, given, direction, some, a, little, slower, so, there, is, a, net, drift, velocity, which, leads, to, an, electric, current, this, involves, small, changes, in, which, wavefunctions, the, electrons, are, in, changing, to, those, with, the, higher, momenta, quantum, mechanics, dictates, that, one, can, only, have, one, electron, in, a, given, state, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, therefore, there, have, to, be, empty, delocalized, electron, states, with, the, higher, momenta, available, at, the, highest, occupied, energies, as, sketched, in, the, figure, in, a, semiconductor, like, silicon, or, a, nonmetal, like, strontium, titanate, there, is, an, energy, gap, between, the, highest, filled, states, of, the, electrons, and, the, lowest, unfilled, so, no, accessible, states, with, slightly, higher, momenta, consequently, semiconductors, and, nonmetals, are, poor, conductors, although, they, can, carry, some, current, when, doped, with, elements, that, introduce, additional, partially, occupied, energy, states, at, higher, temperatures, the, elemental, metals, have, electrical, conductivity, values, of, from, 6, 9, 10, 3, s, cm, for, manganese, to, 6, 3, 10, 5, s, cm, for, silver, in, contrast, a, semiconducting, metalloid, such, as, boron, has, an, electrical, conductivity, 1, 5, 10, 6, s, cm, with, one, exception, metallic, elements, reduce, their, electrical, conductivity, when, heated, plutonium, increases, its, electrical, conductivity, when, heated, in, the, temperature, range, of, around, 175, to, 125, c, with, anomalously, large, thermal, expansion, coefficient, and, a, phase, change, from, monoclinic, to, face, centered, cubic, near, 100, c, all, of, the, metallic, alloys, as, well, as, conducting, ceramics, and, polymers, are, metals, by, the, same, definition, for, instance, titanium, nitride, has, delocalized, states, at, the, fermi, level, they, have, electrical, conductivities, similar, to, those, of, elemental, metals, liquid, forms, are, also, metallic, conductors, or, electricity, for, instance, mercury, in, normal, conditions, no, gases, are, metallic, conductors, however, a, plasma, physics, is, a, metallic, conductor, and, the, charged, particles, in, a, plasma, have, many, properties, in, common, with, those, of, electrons, in, elemental, metals, particularly, for, white, dwarf, stars, metals, are, relatively, good, conductors, of, heat, which, in, metals, is, transported, mainly, by, the, conduction, electrons, at, higher, temperatures, the, electrons, can, occupy, slightly, higher, energy, levels, given, by, fermi, dirac, statistics, these, have, slightly, higher, momenta, kinetic, energy, and, can, pass, on, thermal, energy, the, empirical, wiedemann, franz, law, states, that, in, many, metals, the, ratio, between, thermal, and, electrical, conductivities, is, proportional, to, temperature, with, a, proportionality, constant, that, is, roughly, the, same, for, all, metals, the, contribution, of, a, metal, s, electrons, to, its, heat, capacity, and, thermal, conductivity, and, the, electrical, conductivity, of, the, metal, itself, can, be, approximately, calculated, from, the, free, electron, model, however, this, does, not, take, into, account, the, detailed, structure, of, the, metal, s, ion, lattice, taking, into, account, the, positive, potential, caused, by, the, arrangement, of, the, ion, cores, enables, consideration, of, the, electronic, band, structure, and, binding, energy, of, a, metal, various, models, are, applicable, the, simplest, being, the, nearly, free, electron, model, modern, methods, such, as, density, functional, theory, are, typically, used, the, elements, which, form, metals, usually, form, cations, through, electron, loss, most, will, react, with, oxygen, in, the, air, to, form, oxides, over, various, timescales, potassium, burns, in, seconds, while, iron, rusts, over, years, which, depend, upon, whether, the, native, oxide, forms, a, passivation, layer, that, acts, as, a, diffusion, barrier, some, others, like, palladium, platinum, and, gold, do, not, react, with, the, atmosphere, at, all, gold, can, form, compounds, where, it, gains, an, electron, aurides, e, g, caesium, auride, the, oxides, of, elemental, metals, are, often, basic, however, oxides, with, very, high, oxidation, states, such, as, cro, 3, mn, 2, o, 7, and, oso, 4, often, have, strictly, acidic, reactions, and, oxides, of, the, less, electropositive, metals, such, as, beo, al, 2, o, 3, and, pbo, can, display, both, basic, and, acidic, properties, the, latter, are, termed, amphoteric, oxides, the, elements, that, form, exclusively, metallic, structures, under, ordinary, conditions, are, shown, in, yellow, on, the, periodic, table, below, the, remaining, elements, either, form, covalent, network, structures, light, blue, molecular, covalent, structures, dark, blue, or, remain, as, single, atoms, violet, astatine, at, francium, fr, and, the, elements, from, fermium, fm, onwards, are, shown, in, gray, because, they, are, extremely, radioactive, and, have, never, been, produced, in, bulk, theoretical, and, experimental, evidence, suggests, that, almost, all, these, uninvestigated, elements, should, be, metals, though, there, is, some, doubt, for, oganesson, og, metallic, network, covalent, molecular, covalent, single, atoms, unknown, background, color, shows, bonding, of, simple, substances, in, the, periodic, table, if, there, are, several, the, most, stable, allotrope, is, considered, the, situation, changes, with, pressure, at, extremely, high, pressures, all, elements, and, indeed, all, substances, are, expected, to, metallize, arsenic, as, has, both, a, stable, metallic, allotrope, and, a, metastable, semiconducting, allotrope, at, standard, conditions, a, similar, situation, affects, carbon, c, graphite, is, metallic, but, diamond, is, not, in, the, context, of, metals, an, alloy, is, a, substance, having, metallic, properties, which, is, composed, of, two, or, more, elements, often, at, least, one, of, these, is, a, metallic, element, the, term, alloy, is, sometimes, used, more, generally, as, in, silicon, germanium, alloys, an, alloy, may, have, a, variable, or, fixed, composition, for, example, gold, and, silver, form, an, alloy, in, which, the, proportions, of, gold, or, silver, can, be, varied, titanium, and, silicon, form, an, alloy, tisi, 2, in, which, the, ratio, of, the, two, components, is, fixed, also, known, as, an, intermetallic, compound, most, pure, metals, are, either, too, soft, brittle, or, chemically, reactive, for, practical, use, combining, different, ratios, of, metals, and, other, elements, in, alloys, modifies, the, properties, to, produce, desirable, characteristics, for, instance, more, ductile, harder, resistant, to, corrosion, or, have, a, more, desirable, color, and, luster, of, all, the, metallic, alloys, in, use, today, the, alloys, of, iron, steel, stainless, steel, cast, iron, tool, steel, alloy, steel, make, up, the, largest, proportion, both, by, quantity, and, commercial, value, iron, alloyed, with, various, proportions, of, carbon, gives, low, mid, and, high, carbon, steels, with, increasing, carbon, levels, reducing, ductility, and, toughness, the, addition, of, silicon, will, produce, cast, irons, while, the, addition, of, chromium, nickel, and, molybdenum, to, carbon, steels, more, than, 10, results, in, stainless, steels, with, enhanced, corrosion, resistance, other, significant, metallic, alloys, are, those, of, aluminum, titanium, copper, and, magnesium, copper, alloys, have, been, known, since, prehistory, bronze, gave, the, bronze, age, its, name, and, have, many, applications, today, most, importantly, in, electrical, wiring, the, alloys, of, the, other, three, metals, have, been, developed, relatively, recently, due, to, their, chemical, reactivity, they, need, electrolytic, extraction, processes, the, alloys, of, aluminum, titanium, and, magnesium, are, valued, for, their, high, strength, to, weight, ratios, magnesium, can, also, provide, electromagnetic, shielding, these, materials, are, ideal, for, situations, where, high, strength, to, weight, ratio, is, more, important, than, material, cost, such, as, in, aerospace, and, some, automotive, applications, alloys, specially, designed, for, highly, demanding, applications, such, as, jet, engines, may, contain, more, than, ten, elements, metals, can, be, categorised, by, their, composition, physical, or, chemical, properties, categories, described, in, the, subsections, below, include, ferrous, and, non, ferrous, metals, brittle, metals, and, refractory, metals, white, metals, heavy, and, light, metals, base, noble, and, precious, metals, as, well, as, both, metallic, ceramics, and, polymers, the, term, ferrous, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, meaning, containing, iron, this, can, include, pure, iron, such, as, wrought, iron, or, an, alloy, such, as, steel, ferrous, metals, are, often, magnetic, but, not, exclusively, non, ferrous, metals, and, alloys, lack, appreciable, amounts, of, iron, while, nearly, all, elemental, metals, are, malleable, or, ductile, a, few, beryllium, chromium, manganese, gallium, and, bismuth, are, brittle, arsenic, and, antimony, if, admitted, as, metals, are, brittle, low, values, of, the, ratio, of, bulk, elastic, modulus, to, shear, modulus, pugh, s, criterion, are, indicative, of, intrinsic, brittleness, a, material, is, brittle, if, it, is, hard, for, dislocations, to, move, which, is, often, associated, with, large, burgers, vectors, and, only, a, limited, number, of, slip, planes, a, refractory, metal, is, a, metal, that, is, very, resistant, to, heat, and, wear, which, metals, belong, to, this, category, varies, the, most, common, definition, includes, niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and, rhenium, as, well, as, their, alloys, they, all, have, melting, points, above, 2000, c, and, a, high, hardness, at, room, temperature, several, compounds, such, as, titanium, nitride, are, also, described, as, refractory, metals, a, white, metal, is, any, of, a, range, of, white, colored, alloys, with, relatively, low, melting, points, used, mainly, for, decorative, purposes, in, britain, the, fine, art, trade, uses, the, term, white, metal, in, auction, catalogues, to, describe, foreign, silver, items, which, do, not, carry, british, assay, office, marks, but, which, are, nonetheless, understood, to, be, silver, and, are, priced, accordingly, a, heavy, metal, is, any, relatively, dense, metal, or, metalloid, more, specific, definitions, have, been, proposed, but, none, have, obtained, widespread, acceptance, some, heavy, metals, have, niche, uses, or, are, notably, toxic, some, are, essential, in, trace, amounts, all, other, metals, are, light, metals, the, term, base, metal, refers, to, a, metal, that, is, easily, oxidized, or, corroded, such, as, reacting, easily, with, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, to, form, a, metal, chloride, and, hydrogen, examples, include, iron, nickel, lead, and, zinc, copper, is, considered, a, base, metal, as, it, is, oxidized, relatively, easily, although, it, does, not, react, with, hcl, the, term, noble, metal, is, commonly, used, in, opposition, to, base, metal, noble, metals, are, less, reactive, resistant, to, corrosion, or, oxidation, unlike, most, base, metals, they, tend, to, be, precious, metals, often, due, to, perceived, rarity, examples, include, gold, platinum, silver, rhodium, iridium, and, palladium, in, alchemy, and, numismatics, the, term, base, metal, is, contrasted, with, precious, metal, that, is, those, of, high, economic, value, most, coins, today, are, made, of, base, metals, with, low, intrinsic, value, in, the, past, coins, frequently, derived, their, value, primarily, from, their, precious, metal, content, gold, silver, platinum, and, palladium, each, have, an, iso, 4217, currency, code, currently, they, have, industrial, uses, such, as, platinum, and, palladium, in, catalytic, converters, are, used, in, jewellery, and, also, a, role, as, investments, and, a, store, of, value, palladium, and, platinum, as, of, summer, 2024, were, valued, at, slightly, less, than, half, the, price, of, gold, while, silver, is, substantially, less, expensive, in, electrochemistry, a, valve, metal, is, a, metal, which, passes, current, in, only, one, direction, due, to, the, formation, of, any, insulating, oxide, later, there, are, many, ceramic, compounds, which, have, metallic, electrical, conduction, but, are, not, simple, combinations, of, metallic, elements, they, are, not, the, same, as, cermets, which, are, composites, of, a, non, conducting, ceramic, and, a, conducting, metal, one, set, the, transition, metal, nitrides, has, significant, ionic, character, to, the, bonding, so, can, be, classified, as, both, ceramics, and, metals, they, have, partially, filled, states, at, the, fermi, level, so, are, good, thermal, and, electrical, conductors, and, there, is, often, significant, charge, transfer, from, the, transition, metal, atoms, to, the, nitrogen, however, unlike, most, elemental, metals, ceramic, metals, are, often, not, particularly, ductile, their, uses, are, widespread, for, instance, titanium, nitride, finds, use, in, orthopedic, devices, and, as, a, wear, resistant, coating, in, many, cases, their, utility, depends, upon, there, being, effective, deposition, methods, so, they, can, be, used, as, thin, film, coatings, there, are, many, polymers, which, have, metallic, electrical, conduction, typically, associated, with, extended, aromatic, components, such, as, in, the, polymers, indicated, in, the, figure, the, conduction, of, the, aromatic, regions, is, similar, to, that, of, graphite, so, is, highly, directional, a, half, metal, is, any, substance, that, acts, as, a, conductor, to, electrons, of, one, spin, orientation, but, as, an, insulator, or, semiconductor, to, those, of, the, opposite, spin, they, were, first, described, in, 1983, as, an, explanation, for, the, electrical, properties, of, manganese, based, heusler, alloys, although, all, half, metals, are, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, most, ferromagnets, are, not, half, metals, many, of, the, known, examples, of, half, metals, are, oxides, sulfides, or, heusler, alloys, a, semimetal, is, a, material, with, a, small, energy, overlap, between, the, bottom, of, the, conduction, band, and, the, top, of, the, valence, band, but, they, do, not, overlap, in, momentum, space, unlike, a, regular, metal, semimetals, have, charge, carriers, of, both, types, holes, and, electrons, so, that, one, could, also, argue, that, they, should, be, called, double, metals, rather, than, semimetals, however, the, charge, carriers, typically, occur, in, much, smaller, numbers, than, in, a, real, metal, in, this, respect, they, resemble, degenerate, semiconductors, more, closely, this, explains, why, the, electrical, properties, of, semimetals, are, partway, between, those, of, metals, and, semiconductors, there, are, additional, types, in, particular, weyl, and, dirac, semimetals, the, classic, elemental, semimetallic, elements, are, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, tin, gray, tin, and, graphite, there, are, also, chemical, compounds, such, as, mercury, telluride, hgte, and, some, conductive, polymers, can, behave, as, semimetals, metallic, elements, up, to, the, vicinity, of, iron, in, the, periodic, table, are, largely, made, via, stellar, nucleosynthesis, in, this, process, lighter, elements, from, hydrogen, to, silicon, undergo, successive, fusion, reactions, inside, stars, releasing, light, and, heat, and, forming, heavier, elements, with, higher, atomic, numbers, heavier, elements, are, not, usually, formed, this, way, since, fusion, reactions, involving, such, nuclei, would, consume, rather, than, release, energy, rather, they, are, largely, synthesised, from, elements, with, a, lower, atomic, number, by, neutron, capture, with, the, two, main, modes, of, this, repetitive, capture, being, the, s, process, and, the, r, process, in, the, s, process, s, stands, for, slow, singular, captures, are, separated, by, years, or, decades, allowing, the, less, stable, nuclei, to, beta, decay, while, in, the, r, process, rapid, captures, happen, faster, than, nuclei, can, decay, therefore, the, s, process, takes, a, more, or, less, clear, path, for, example, stable, cadmium, 110, nuclei, are, successively, bombarded, by, free, neutrons, inside, a, star, until, they, form, cadmium, 115, nuclei, which, are, unstable, and, decay, to, form, indium, 115, which, is, nearly, stable, with, a, half, life, 30, 000, times, the, age, of, the, universe, these, nuclei, capture, neutrons, and, form, indium, 116, which, is, unstable, and, decays, to, form, tin, 116, and, so, on, in, contrast, there, is, no, such, path, in, the, r, process, the, s, process, stops, at, bismuth, due, to, the, short, half, lives, of, the, next, two, elements, polonium, and, astatine, which, decay, to, bismuth, or, lead, the, r, process, is, so, fast, it, can, skip, this, zone, of, instability, and, go, on, to, create, heavier, elements, such, as, thorium, and, uranium, metals, condense, in, planets, as, a, result, of, stellar, evolution, and, destruction, processes, stars, lose, much, of, their, mass, when, it, is, ejected, late, in, their, lifetimes, and, sometimes, thereafter, as, a, result, of, a, neutron, star, merger, thereby, increasing, the, abundance, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, in, the, interstellar, medium, when, gravitational, attraction, causes, this, matter, to, coalesce, and, collapse, new, stars, and, planets, are, formed, the, earth, s, crust, is, made, of, approximately, 25, of, metallic, elements, by, weight, of, which, 80, are, light, metals, such, as, sodium, magnesium, and, aluminium, despite, the, overall, scarcity, of, some, heavier, metals, such, as, copper, they, can, become, concentrated, in, economically, extractable, quantities, as, a, result, of, mountain, building, erosion, or, other, geological, processes, metallic, elements, are, primarily, found, as, lithophiles, rock, loving, or, chalcophiles, ore, loving, lithophile, elements, are, mainly, the, s, block, elements, the, more, reactive, of, the, d, block, elements, and, the, f, block, elements, they, have, a, strong, affinity, for, oxygen, and, mostly, exist, as, relatively, low, density, silicate, minerals, chalcophile, elements, are, mainly, the, less, reactive, d, block, elements, and, the, period, 4, 6, p, block, metals, they, are, usually, found, in, insoluble, sulfide, minerals, being, denser, than, the, lithophiles, hence, sinking, lower, into, the, crust, at, the, time, of, its, solidification, the, chalcophiles, tend, to, be, less, abundant, than, the, lithophiles, on, the, other, hand, gold, is, a, siderophile, or, iron, loving, element, it, does, not, readily, form, compounds, with, either, oxygen, or, sulfur, at, the, time, of, the, earth, s, formation, and, as, the, most, noble, inert, of, metallic, elements, gold, sank, into, the, core, due, to, its, tendency, to, form, high, density, metallic, alloys, consequently, it, is, relatively, rare, some, other, less, noble, ones, molybdenum, rhenium, the, platinum, group, metals, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and, platinum, germanium, and, tin, can, be, counted, as, siderophiles, but, only, in, terms, of, their, primary, occurrence, in, the, earth, core, mantle, and, crust, rather, the, crust, these, otherwise, occur, in, the, crust, in, small, quantities, chiefly, as, chalcophiles, less, so, in, their, native, form, the, rotating, fluid, outer, core, of, the, earth, s, interior, which, is, composed, mostly, of, iron, is, thought, to, be, the, source, of, earth, s, protective, magnetic, field, the, core, lies, above, earth, s, solid, inner, core, and, below, its, mantle, if, it, could, be, rearranged, into, a, column, having, a, 5, m, 2, 54, sq, ft, footprint, it, would, have, a, height, of, nearly, 700, light, years, the, magnetic, field, shields, the, earth, from, the, charged, particles, of, the, solar, wind, and, cosmic, rays, that, would, otherwise, strip, away, the, upper, atmosphere, including, the, ozone, layer, that, limits, the, transmission, of, ultraviolet, radiation, metallic, elements, are, often, extracted, from, the, earth, by, mining, ores, that, are, rich, sources, of, the, requisite, elements, such, as, bauxite, ores, are, located, by, prospecting, techniques, followed, by, the, exploration, and, examination, of, deposits, mineral, sources, are, generally, divided, into, surface, mines, which, are, mined, by, excavation, using, heavy, equipment, and, subsurface, mines, in, some, cases, the, sale, price, of, the, metal, s, involved, make, it, economically, feasible, to, mine, lower, concentration, sources, once, the, ore, is, mined, the, elements, must, be, extracted, usually, by, chemical, or, electrolytic, reduction, pyrometallurgy, uses, high, temperatures, to, convert, ore, into, raw, metals, while, hydrometallurgy, employs, aqueous, chemistry, for, the, same, purpose, when, a, metallic, ore, is, an, ionic, compound, the, ore, must, usually, be, smelted, heated, with, a, reducing, agent, to, extract, the, pure, metal, many, common, metals, such, as, iron, are, smelted, using, carbon, as, a, reducing, agent, some, metals, such, as, aluminum, and, sodium, have, no, commercially, practical, reducing, agent, and, are, extracted, using, electrolysis, instead, sulfide, ores, are, not, reduced, directly, to, the, metal, but, are, roasted, in, air, to, convert, them, to, oxides, demand, for, metals, is, closely, linked, to, economic, growth, given, their, use, in, infrastructure, construction, manufacturing, and, consumer, goods, during, the, 20th, century, the, variety, of, metals, used, in, society, grew, rapidly, today, the, development, of, major, nations, such, as, china, and, india, and, technological, advances, are, fueling, ever, more, demand, the, result, is, that, mining, activities, are, expanding, and, more, and, more, of, the, world, s, metal, stocks, are, above, ground, in, use, rather, than, below, ground, as, unused, reserves, an, example, is, the, in, use, stock, of, copper, between, 1932, and, 1999, copper, in, use, in, the, u, s, rose, from, 73, g, to, 238, g, per, person, metals, are, inherently, recyclable, so, in, principle, can, be, used, over, and, over, again, minimizing, these, negative, environmental, impacts, and, saving, energy, for, example, 95, of, the, energy, used, to, make, aluminum, from, bauxite, ore, is, saved, by, using, recycled, material, globally, metal, recycling, is, generally, low, in, 2010, the, international, resource, panel, hosted, by, the, united, nations, environment, programme, published, reports, on, metal, stocks, that, exist, within, society, and, their, recycling, rates, the, authors, of, the, report, observed, that, the, metal, stocks, in, society, can, serve, as, huge, mines, above, ground, they, warned, that, the, recycling, rates, of, some, rare, metals, used, in, applications, such, as, mobile, phones, battery, packs, for, hybrid, cars, and, fuel, cells, are, so, low, that, unless, future, end, of, life, recycling, rates, are, dramatically, stepped, up, these, critical, metals, will, become, unavailable, for, use, in, modern, technology, copper, which, occurs, in, native, form, may, have, been, the, first, metal, discovered, given, its, distinctive, appearance, heaviness, and, malleability, gold, silver, iron, as, meteoric, iron, and, lead, were, likewise, discovered, in, prehistory, forms, of, brass, an, alloy, of, copper, and, zinc, made, by, concurrently, smelting, the, ores, of, these, metals, originate, from, this, period, although, pure, zinc, was, not, isolated, until, the, 13th, century, the, malleability, of, the, solid, metals, led, to, the, first, attempts, to, craft, metal, ornaments, tools, and, weapons, meteoric, iron, containing, nickel, was, discovered, from, time, to, time, and, in, some, respects, this, was, superior, to, any, industrial, steel, manufactured, up, to, the, 1880s, when, alloy, steels, become, prominent, the, discovery, of, bronze, an, alloy, of, copper, with, arsenic, or, tin, enabled, people, to, create, metal, objects, which, were, harder, and, more, durable, than, previously, possible, bronze, tools, weapons, armor, and, building, materials, such, as, decorative, tiles, were, harder, and, more, durable, than, their, stone, and, copper, chalcolithic, predecessors, initially, bronze, was, made, of, copper, and, arsenic, forming, arsenic, bronze, by, smelting, naturally, or, artificially, mixed, ores, of, copper, and, arsenic, the, earliest, artifacts, so, far, known, come, from, the, iranian, plateau, in, the, fifth, millennium, bce, it, was, only, later, that, tin, was, used, becoming, the, major, non, copper, ingredient, of, bronze, in, the, late, third, millennium, bce, pure, tin, itself, was, first, isolated, in, 1800, bce, by, chinese, and, japanese, metalworkers, mercury, was, known, to, ancient, chinese, and, indians, before, 2000, bce, and, found, in, egyptian, tombs, dating, from, 1500, bce, the, earliest, known, production, of, steel, an, iron, carbon, alloy, is, seen, in, pieces, of, ironware, excavated, from, an, archaeological, site, in, anatolia, kaman, kaleh, y, k, which, are, nearly, 4, 000, years, old, dating, from, 1800, bce, from, about, 500, bce, sword, makers, of, toledo, spain, were, making, early, forms, of, alloy, steel, by, adding, a, mineral, called, wolframite, which, contained, tungsten, and, manganese, to, iron, ore, and, carbon, the, resulting, toledo, steel, came, to, the, attention, of, rome, when, used, by, hannibal, in, the, punic, wars, it, soon, became, the, basis, for, the, weaponry, of, roman, legions, such, swords, were, stronger, in, composition, than, any, existing, sword, and, because, would, not, break, provided, a, psychological, advantage, to, the, roman, soldier, in, pre, columbian, america, objects, made, of, tumbaga, an, alloy, of, copper, and, gold, started, being, produced, in, panama, and, costa, rica, between, 300, and, 500, ce, small, metal, sculptures, were, common, and, an, extensive, range, of, tumbaga, and, gold, ornaments, comprised, the, usual, regalia, of, persons, of, high, status, at, around, the, same, time, indigenous, ecuadorians, were, combining, gold, with, a, naturally, occurring, platinum, alloy, containing, small, amounts, of, palladium, rhodium, and, iridium, to, produce, miniatures, and, masks, of, a, white, gold, platinum, alloy, the, metal, workers, involved, heated, gold, with, grains, of, the, platinum, alloy, until, the, gold, melted, after, cooling, the, resulting, conglomeration, was, hammered, and, reheated, repeatedly, until, it, became, homogenous, equivalent, to, melting, all, the, metals, attaining, the, melting, points, of, the, platinum, group, metals, concerned, was, beyond, the, technology, of, the, day, gold, is, for, the, mistress, silver, for, the, maid, copper, for, the, craftsman, cunning, at, his, trade, good, said, the, baron, sitting, in, his, hall, but, iron, cold, iron, is, master, of, them, all, from, cold, iron, by, rudyard, kipling, arabic, and, medieval, alchemists, believed, that, all, metals, and, matter, were, composed, of, the, principle, of, sulfur, the, father, of, all, metals, and, carrying, the, combustible, property, and, the, principle, of, mercury, the, mother, of, all, metals, and, carrier, of, the, liquidity, fusibility, and, volatility, properties, these, principles, were, not, necessarily, the, common, substances, sulfur, and, mercury, found, in, most, laboratories, this, theory, reinforced, the, belief, that, all, metals, were, destined, to, become, gold, in, the, bowels, of, the, earth, through, the, proper, combinations, of, heat, digestion, time, and, elimination, of, contaminants, all, of, which, could, be, developed, and, hastened, through, the, knowledge, and, methods, of, alchemy, arsenic, zinc, antimony, and, bismuth, became, known, although, these, were, at, first, called, semimetals, or, bastard, metals, on, account, of, their, immalleability, albertus, magnus, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, to, isolate, arsenic, from, a, compound, in, 1250, by, heating, soap, together, with, arsenic, trisulfide, metallic, zinc, which, is, brittle, if, impure, was, isolated, in, india, by, 1300, ad, the, first, description, of, a, procedure, for, isolating, antimony, is, in, the, 1540, book, de, la, pirotechnia, by, vannoccio, biringuccio, bismuth, was, described, by, agricola, in, de, natura, fossilium, c, 1546, it, had, been, confused, in, early, times, with, tin, and, lead, because, of, its, resemblance, to, those, elements, the, first, systematic, text, on, the, arts, of, mining, and, metallurgy, was, de, la, pirotechnia, 1540, by, vannoccio, biringuccio, which, treats, the, examination, fusion, and, working, of, metals, sixteen, years, later, georgius, agricola, published, de, re, metallica, in, 1556, an, account, of, the, profession, of, mining, metallurgy, and, the, accessory, arts, and, sciences, an, extensive, treatise, on, the, chemical, industry, through, the, sixteenth, century, he, gave, the, following, description, of, a, metal, in, his, de, natura, fossilium, 1546, metal, is, a, mineral, body, by, nature, either, liquid, or, somewhat, hard, the, latter, may, be, melted, by, the, heat, of, the, fire, but, when, it, has, cooled, down, again, and, lost, all, heat, it, becomes, hard, again, and, resumes, its, proper, form, in, this, respect, it, differs, from, the, stone, which, melts, in, the, fire, for, although, the, latter, regain, its, hardness, yet, it, loses, its, pristine, form, and, properties, traditionally, there, are, six, different, kinds, of, metals, namely, gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and, lead, there, are, really, others, for, quicksilver, is, a, metal, although, the, alchemists, disagree, with, us, on, this, subject, and, bismuth, is, also, the, ancient, greek, writers, seem, to, have, been, ignorant, of, bismuth, wherefore, ammonius, rightly, states, that, there, are, many, species, of, metals, animals, and, plants, which, are, unknown, to, us, stibium, when, smelted, in, the, crucible, and, refined, has, as, much, right, to, be, regarded, as, a, proper, metal, as, is, accorded, to, lead, by, writers, if, when, smelted, a, certain, portion, be, added, to, tin, a, bookseller, s, alloy, is, produced, from, which, the, type, is, made, that, is, used, by, those, who, print, books, on, paper, each, metal, has, its, own, form, which, it, preserves, when, separated, from, those, metals, which, were, mixed, with, it, therefore, neither, electrum, nor, stannum, is, of, itself, a, real, metal, but, rather, an, alloy, of, two, metals, electrum, is, an, alloy, of, gold, and, silver, stannum, of, lead, and, silver, and, yet, if, silver, be, parted, from, the, electrum, then, gold, remains, and, not, electrum, if, silver, be, taken, away, from, stannum, then, lead, remains, and, not, stannum, whether, brass, however, is, found, as, a, native, metal, or, not, cannot, be, ascertained, with, any, surety, we, only, know, of, the, artificial, brass, which, consists, of, copper, tinted, with, the, colour, of, the, mineral, calamine, and, yet, if, any, should, be, dug, up, it, would, be, a, proper, metal, black, and, white, copper, seem, to, be, different, from, the, red, kind, metal, therefore, is, by, nature, either, solid, as, i, have, stated, or, fluid, as, in, the, unique, case, of, quicksilver, but, enough, now, concerning, the, simple, kinds, platinum, the, third, precious, metal, after, gold, and, silver, was, discovered, in, ecuador, during, the, period, 1736, to, 1744, by, the, spanish, astronomer, antonio, de, ulloa, and, his, colleague, the, mathematician, jorge, juan, y, santacilia, ulloa, was, the, first, person, to, write, a, scientific, description, of, the, metal, in, 1748, in, 1789, the, german, chemist, martin, heinrich, klaproth, isolated, an, oxide, of, uranium, which, he, thought, was, the, metal, itself, klaproth, was, subsequently, credited, as, the, discoverer, of, uranium, it, was, not, until, 1841, that, the, french, chemist, eug, ne, melchior, p, ligot, prepared, the, first, sample, of, uranium, metal, henri, becquerel, subsequently, discovered, radioactivity, in, 1896, using, uranium, in, the, 1790s, joseph, priestley, and, the, dutch, chemist, martinus, van, marum, observed, the, effect, of, metal, surfaces, on, the, dehydrogenation, of, alcohol, a, development, which, subsequently, led, in, 1831, to, the, industrial, scale, synthesis, of, sulphuric, acid, using, a, platinum, catalyst, in, 1803, cerium, was, the, first, of, the, lanthanide, metals, to, be, discovered, in, bastn, s, sweden, by, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, and, wilhelm, hisinger, and, independently, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, in, germany, the, lanthanide, metals, were, regarded, as, oddities, until, the, 1960s, when, methods, were, developed, to, more, efficiently, separate, them, from, one, another, they, have, subsequently, found, uses, in, cell, phones, magnets, lasers, lighting, batteries, catalytic, converters, and, in, other, applications, enabling, modern, technologies, other, metals, discovered, and, prepared, during, this, time, were, cobalt, nickel, manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, and, chromium, and, some, of, the, platinum, group, metals, palladium, osmium, iridium, and, rhodium, all, elemental, metals, discovered, before, 1809, had, relatively, high, densities, their, heaviness, was, regarded, as, a, distinguishing, criterion, from, 1809, onward, light, metals, such, as, sodium, potassium, and, strontium, were, isolated, their, low, densities, challenged, conventional, wisdom, as, to, the, nature, of, metals, they, behaved, chemically, as, metals, however, and, were, subsequently, recognized, as, such, aluminium, was, discovered, in, 1824, but, it, was, not, until, 1886, that, an, industrial, large, scale, production, method, was, developed, prices, of, aluminium, dropped, and, aluminium, became, widely, used, in, jewelry, everyday, items, eyeglass, frames, optical, instruments, tableware, and, foil, in, the, 1890s, and, early, 20th, century, aluminium, s, ability, to, form, hard, yet, light, alloys, with, other, metals, provided, the, metal, many, uses, at, the, time, during, world, war, i, major, governments, demanded, large, shipments, of, aluminium, for, light, and, strong, airframes, while, pure, metallic, titanium, 99, 9, was, first, prepared, in, 1910, it, was, not, used, outside, the, laboratory, until, 1932, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, soviet, union, pioneered, the, use, of, titanium, in, military, and, submarine, applications, as, part, of, programs, related, to, the, cold, war, starting, in, the, early, 1950s, titanium, came, into, use, in, military, aviation, particularly, in, high, performance, jets, starting, with, aircraft, such, as, the, f, 100, super, sabre, and, lockheed, a, 12, and, sr, 71, metallic, scandium, was, produced, for, the, first, time, in, 1937, the, first, pound, of, 99, pure, scandium, metal, was, produced, in, 1960, production, of, aluminium, scandium, alloys, began, in, 1971, following, a, u, s, patent, aluminium, scandium, alloys, were, also, developed, in, the, ussr, the, modern, era, in, steelmaking, began, with, the, introduction, of, henry, bessemer, s, bessemer, process, in, 1855, the, raw, material, for, which, was, pig, iron, his, method, let, him, produce, steel, in, large, quantities, cheaply, thus, mild, steel, came, to, be, used, for, most, purposes, for, which, wrought, iron, was, formerly, used, the, gilchrist, thomas, process, or, basic, bessemer, process, was, an, improvement, to, the, bessemer, process, made, by, lining, the, converter, with, a, basic, material, to, remove, phosphorus, due, to, its, high, tensile, strength, and, low, cost, steel, came, to, be, a, major, component, used, in, buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and, weapons, in, 1872, the, englishmen, clark, and, woods, patented, an, alloy, that, would, today, be, considered, a, stainless, steel, the, corrosion, resistance, of, iron, chromium, alloys, had, been, recognized, in, 1821, by, french, metallurgist, pierre, berthier, he, noted, their, resistance, against, attack, by, some, acids, and, suggested, their, use, in, cutlery, metallurgists, of, the, 19th, century, were, unable, to, produce, the, combination, of, low, carbon, and, high, chromium, found, in, most, modern, stainless, steels, and, the, high, chromium, alloys, they, could, produce, were, too, brittle, to, be, practical, it, was, not, until, 1912, that, the, industrialization, of, stainless, steel, alloys, occurred, in, england, germany, and, the, united, states, by, 1900, three, metals, with, atomic, numbers, less, than, lead, 82, the, heaviest, stable, metal, remained, to, be, discovered, elements, 71, 72, 75, von, welsbach, in, 1906, proved, that, the, old, ytterbium, also, contained, a, new, element, 71, which, he, named, cassiopeium, urbain, proved, this, simultaneously, but, his, samples, were, very, impure, and, only, contained, trace, quantities, of, the, new, element, despite, this, his, chosen, name, lutetium, was, adopted, in, 1908, ogawa, found, element, 75, in, thorianite, but, assigned, it, as, element, 43, instead, of, 75, and, named, it, nipponium, in, 1925, walter, noddack, ida, eva, tacke, and, otto, berg, announced, its, separation, from, gadolinite, and, gave, it, the, present, name, rhenium, georges, urbain, claimed, to, have, found, element, 72, in, rare, earth, residues, while, vladimir, vernadsky, independently, found, it, in, orthite, neither, claim, was, confirmed, due, to, world, war, i, and, neither, could, be, confirmed, later, as, the, chemistry, they, reported, does, not, match, that, now, known, for, hafnium, after, the, war, in, 1922, coster, and, hevesy, found, it, by, x, ray, spectroscopic, analysis, in, norwegian, zircon, hafnium, was, thus, the, last, stable, element, to, be, discovered, though, rhenium, was, the, last, to, be, correctly, recognized, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, scientists, had, synthesized, four, post, uranium, elements, all, of, which, are, radioactive, unstable, metals, neptunium, in, 1940, plutonium, 1940, 41, and, curium, and, americium, 1944, representing, elements, 93, to, 96, the, first, two, of, these, were, eventually, found, in, nature, as, well, curium, and, americium, were, by, products, of, the, manhattan, project, which, produced, the, world, s, first, atomic, bomb, in, 1945, the, bomb, was, based, on, the, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, a, metal, first, thought, to, have, been, discovered, nearly, 150, years, earlier, superalloys, composed, of, combinations, of, fe, ni, co, and, cr, and, lesser, amounts, of, w, mo, ta, nb, ti, and, al, were, developed, shortly, after, world, war, ii, for, use, in, high, performance, engines, operating, at, elevated, temperatures, above, 650, c, 1, 200, f, they, retain, most, of, their, strength, under, these, conditions, for, prolonged, periods, and, combine, good, low, temperature, ductility, with, resistance, to, corrosion, or, oxidation, superalloys, can, now, be, found, in, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, land, maritime, and, aerospace, turbines, and, chemical, and, petroleum, plants, the, successful, development, of, the, atomic, bomb, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, sparked, further, efforts, to, synthesize, new, elements, nearly, all, of, which, are, or, are, expected, to, be, metals, and, all, of, which, are, radioactive, it, was, not, until, 1949, that, element, 97, berkelium, next, after, element, 96, curium, was, synthesized, by, firing, alpha, particles, at, an, americium, target, in, 1952, element, 100, fermium, was, found, in, the, debris, of, the, first, hydrogen, bomb, explosion, hydrogen, a, nonmetal, had, been, identified, as, an, element, nearly, 200, years, earlier, since, 1952, elements, 101, mendelevium, to, 118, oganesson, have, been, synthesized, a, metallic, glass, also, known, as, an, amorphous, or, glassy, metal, is, a, solid, metallic, material, usually, an, alloy, with, a, disordered, atomic, scale, structure, most, pure, and, alloyed, metals, in, their, solid, state, have, atoms, arranged, in, a, highly, ordered, crystalline, structure, in, contrast, these, have, a, non, crystalline, glass, like, structure, but, unlike, common, glasses, such, as, window, glass, which, are, typically, electrical, insulators, amorphous, metals, have, good, electrical, conductivity, amorphous, metals, are, produced, in, several, ways, including, extremely, rapid, cooling, physical, vapor, deposition, solid, state, reaction, ion, irradiation, and, mechanical, alloying, the, first, reported, metallic, glass, was, an, alloy, au, 75, si, 25, produced, at, caltech, in, 1960, more, recently, batches, of, amorphous, steel, with, three, times, the, strength, of, conventional, steel, alloys, have, been, produced, currently, the, most, important, applications, rely, on, the, special, magnetic, properties, of, some, ferromagnetic, metallic, glasses, the, low, magnetization, loss, is, used, in, high, efficiency, transformers, theft, control, id, tags, and, other, article, surveillance, schemes, often, use, metallic, glasses, because, of, these, magnetic, properties, a, shape, memory, alloy, sma, is, an, alloy, that, remembers, its, original, shape, and, when, deformed, returns, to, its, pre, deformed, shape, when, heated, while, the, shape, memory, effect, had, been, first, observed, in, 1932, in, an, au, cd, alloy, it, was, not, until, 1962, with, the, accidental, discovery, of, the, effect, in, a, ni, ti, alloy, that, research, began, in, earnest, and, another, ten, years, before, commercial, applications, emerged, sma, s, have, applications, in, robotics, and, automotive, aerospace, and, biomedical, industries, there, is, another, type, of, sma, called, a, ferromagnetic, shape, memory, alloy, fsma, that, changes, shape, under, strong, magnetic, fields, these, materials, are, of, interest, as, the, magnetic, response, tends, to, be, faster, and, more, efficient, than, temperature, induced, responses, in, 1984, israeli, metallurgist, dan, shechtman, found, an, aluminum, manganese, alloy, having, five, fold, symmetry, in, breach, of, crystallographic, convention, at, the, time, which, said, that, crystalline, structures, could, only, have, two, three, four, or, six, fold, symmetry, due, to, reservation, about, the, scientific, community, s, reaction, it, took, him, two, years, to, publish, the, results, for, which, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 2011, since, this, time, hundreds, of, quasicrystals, have, been, reported, and, confirmed, they, exist, in, many, metallic, alloys, and, some, polymers, quasicrystals, are, found, most, often, in, aluminum, alloys, al, li, cu, al, mn, si, al, ni, co, al, pd, mn, al, cu, fe, al, cu, v, etc, but, numerous, other, compositions, are, also, known, cd, yb, ti, zr, ni, zn, mg, ho, zn, mg, sc, in, ag, yb, pd, u, si, etc, quasicrystals, effectively, have, infinitely, large, unit, cells, icosahedrite, al, 63, cu, 24, fe, 13, the, first, quasicrystal, found, in, nature, was, discovered, in, 2009, most, quasicrystals, have, ceramic, like, properties, including, low, electrical, conductivity, approaching, values, seen, in, insulators, and, low, thermal, conductivity, high, hardness, brittleness, and, resistance, to, corrosion, and, non, stick, properties, quasicrystals, have, been, used, to, develop, heat, insulation, leds, diesel, engines, and, new, materials, that, convert, heat, to, electricity, new, applications, may, take, advantage, of, the, low, coefficient, of, friction, and, the, hardness, of, some, quasicrystalline, materials, for, example, embedding, particles, in, plastic, to, make, strong, hard, wearing, low, friction, plastic, gears, other, potential, applications, include, selective, solar, absorbers, for, power, conversion, broad, wavelength, reflectors, and, bone, repair, and, prostheses, applications, where, biocompatibility, low, friction, and, corrosion, resistance, are, required, complex, metallic, alloys, cmas, are, intermetallic, compounds, characterized, by, large, unit, cells, comprising, some, tens, up, to, thousands, of, atoms, the, presence, of, well, defined, clusters, of, atoms, frequently, with, icosahedral, symmetry, and, partial, disorder, within, their, crystalline, lattices, they, are, composed, of, two, or, more, metallic, elements, sometimes, with, metalloids, or, chalcogenides, added, they, include, for, example, nacd2, with, 348, sodium, atoms, and, 768, cadmium, atoms, in, the, unit, cell, linus, pauling, attempted, to, describe, the, structure, of, nacd, 2, in, 1923, but, did, not, succeed, until, 1955, at, first, called, giant, unit, cell, crystals, interest, in, cmas, as, they, came, to, be, called, did, not, pick, up, until, 2002, with, the, publication, of, a, paper, called, structurally, complex, alloy, phases, given, at, the, 8th, international, conference, on, quasicrystals, potential, applications, of, cmas, include, as, heat, insulation, solar, heating, magnetic, refrigerators, using, waste, heat, to, generate, electricity, and, coatings, for, turbine, blades, in, military, engines, high, entropy, alloys, heas, such, as, allimgscti, are, composed, of, equal, or, nearly, equal, quantities, of, five, or, more, metals, compared, to, conventional, alloys, with, only, one, or, two, base, metals, heas, have, considerably, better, strength, to, weight, ratios, higher, tensile, strength, and, greater, resistance, to, fracturing, corrosion, and, oxidation, although, heas, were, described, as, early, as, 1981, significant, interest, did, not, develop, until, the, 2010s, they, continue, to, be, a, focus, of, research, in, materials, science, and, engineering, because, of, their, desirable, properties, in, a, max, phase, m, is, an, early, transition, metal, a, is, an, a, group, element, mostly, group, iiia, and, iva, or, groups, 13, and, 14, and, x, is, either, carbon, or, nitrogen, examples, are, hf, 2, snc, and, ti, 4, aln, 3, such, alloys, have, high, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, thermal, shock, resistance, damage, tolerance, machinability, high, elastic, stiffness, and, low, thermal, expansion, coefficients, they, can, be, polished, to, a, metallic, luster, because, of, their, excellent, electrical, conductivities, during, mechanical, testing, it, has, been, found, that, polycrystalline, ti, 3, sic, 2, cylinders, can, be, repeatedly, compressed, at, room, temperature, up, to, stresses, of, 1, gpa, and, fully, recover, upon, the, removal, of, the, load, some, max, phases, are, also, highly, resistant, to, chemical, attack, e, g, ti, 3, sic, 2, and, high, temperature, oxidation, in, air, ti, 2, alc, cr, 2, alc, 2, and, ti, 3, alc, 2, potential, applications, for, max, phase, alloys, include, as, tough, machinable, thermal, shock, resistant, refractories, high, temperature, heating, elements, coatings, for, electrical, contacts, and, neutron, irradiation, resistant, parts, for, nuclear, applications
