chromium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cr, and, atomic, number, 24, it, is, the, first, element, in, group, 6, it, is, a, steely, grey, lustrous, hard, and, brittle, transition, metal, chromium, is, valued, for, its, high, corrosion, resistance, and, hardness, a, major, development, in, steel, production, was, the, discovery, that, steel, could, be, made, highly, resistant, to, corrosion, and, discoloration, by, adding, metallic, chromium, to, form, stainless, steel, stainless, steel, and, chrome, plating, electroplating, with, chromium, together, comprise, 85, of, the, commercial, use, chromium, is, also, greatly, valued, as, a, metal, that, is, able, to, be, highly, polished, while, resisting, tarnishing, polished, chromium, reflects, almost, 70, of, the, visible, spectrum, and, almost, 90, of, infrared, light, the, name, of, the, element, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, chr, ma, meaning, color, because, many, chromium, compounds, are, intensely, colored, industrial, production, of, chromium, proceeds, from, chromite, ore, mostly, fecr, 2, o, 4, to, produce, ferrochromium, an, iron, chromium, alloy, by, means, of, aluminothermic, or, silicothermic, reactions, ferrochromium, is, then, used, to, produce, alloys, such, as, stainless, steel, pure, chromium, metal, is, produced, by, a, different, process, roasting, and, leaching, of, chromite, to, separate, it, from, iron, followed, by, reduction, with, carbon, and, then, aluminium, in, the, united, states, trivalent, chromium, cr, iii, ion, is, considered, an, essential, nutrient, in, humans, for, insulin, sugar, and, lipid, metabolism, however, in, 2014, the, european, food, safety, authority, acting, for, the, european, union, concluded, that, there, was, insufficient, evidence, for, chromium, to, be, recognized, as, essential, while, chromium, metal, and, cr, iii, ions, are, considered, non, toxic, chromate, and, its, derivatives, often, called, hexavalent, chromium, is, toxic, and, carcinogenic, according, to, the, european, chemicals, agency, echa, chromium, trioxide, that, is, used, in, industrial, electroplating, processes, is, a, substance, of, very, high, concern, svhc, gaseous, chromium, has, a, ground, state, electron, configuration, of, 3d, 5, 4s, 1, it, is, the, first, element, in, the, periodic, table, whose, configuration, violates, the, aufbau, principle, exceptions, to, the, principle, also, occur, later, in, the, periodic, table, for, elements, such, as, copper, niobium, and, molybdenum, chromium, is, the, first, element, in, the, 3d, series, where, the, 3d, electrons, start, to, sink, into, the, core, they, thus, contribute, less, to, metallic, bonding, and, hence, the, melting, and, boiling, points, and, the, enthalpy, of, atomisation, of, chromium, are, lower, than, those, of, the, preceding, element, vanadium, chromium, vi, is, a, strong, oxidising, agent, in, contrast, to, the, molybdenum, vi, and, tungsten, vi, oxides, chromium, is, the, third, hardest, element, after, carbon, diamond, and, boron, its, mohs, hardness, is, 8, 5, which, means, that, it, can, scratch, samples, of, quartz, and, topaz, but, can, be, scratched, by, corundum, chromium, is, highly, resistant, to, tarnishing, which, makes, it, useful, as, a, metal, that, preserves, its, outermost, layer, from, corroding, unlike, other, metals, such, as, copper, magnesium, and, aluminium, chromium, has, a, melting, point, of, 1907, c, 3465, f, which, is, relatively, low, compared, to, the, majority, of, transition, metals, however, it, still, has, the, second, highest, melting, point, out, of, all, the, period, 4, elements, being, topped, by, vanadium, by, 3, c, 5, f, at, 1910, c, 3470, f, the, boiling, point, of, 2671, c, 4840, f, however, is, comparatively, lower, having, the, fourth, lowest, boiling, point, out, of, the, period, 4, transition, metals, alone, behind, copper, manganese, and, zinc, the, electrical, resistivity, of, chromium, at, 20, c, is, 125, nanoohm, meters, chromium, has, a, high, specular, reflection, in, comparison, to, other, transition, metals, in, infrared, at, 425, m, chromium, has, a, maximum, reflectance, of, about, 72, reducing, to, a, minimum, of, 62, at, 750, m, before, rising, again, to, 90, at, 4000, m, when, chromium, is, used, in, stainless, steel, alloys, and, polished, the, specular, reflection, decreases, with, the, inclusion, of, additional, metals, yet, is, still, high, in, comparison, with, other, alloys, between, 40, and, 60, of, the, visible, spectrum, is, reflected, from, polished, stainless, steel, the, explanation, on, why, chromium, displays, such, a, high, turnout, of, reflected, photon, waves, in, general, especially, the, 90, in, infrared, can, be, attributed, to, chromium, s, magnetic, properties, chromium, has, unique, magnetic, properties, it, is, the, only, elemental, solid, that, shows, antiferromagnetic, ordering, at, room, temperature, and, below, above, 38, c, its, magnetic, ordering, becomes, paramagnetic, the, antiferromagnetic, properties, which, cause, the, chromium, atoms, to, temporarily, ionize, and, bond, with, themselves, are, present, because, the, body, centric, cubic, s, magnetic, properties, are, disproportionate, to, the, lattice, periodicity, this, is, due, to, the, magnetic, moments, at, the, cube, s, corners, and, the, unequal, but, antiparallel, cube, centers, from, here, the, frequency, dependent, relative, permittivity, of, chromium, deriving, from, maxwell, s, equations, and, chromium, s, antiferromagnetism, leaves, chromium, with, a, high, infrared, and, visible, light, reflectance, chromium, metal, in, air, is, passivated, it, forms, a, thin, protective, surface, layer, of, chromium, oxide, with, the, corundum, structure, passivation, can, be, enhanced, by, short, contact, with, oxidizing, acids, like, nitric, acid, passivated, chromium, is, stable, against, acids, passivation, can, be, removed, with, a, strong, reducing, agent, that, destroys, the, protective, oxide, layer, on, the, metal, chromium, metal, treated, in, this, way, readily, dissolves, in, weak, acids, the, surface, chromia, cr, 2, o, 3, scale, is, adherent, to, the, metal, in, contrast, iron, forms, a, more, porous, oxide, which, is, weak, and, flakes, easily, and, exposes, fresh, metal, to, the, air, causing, continued, rusting, at, room, temperature, the, chromia, scale, is, a, few, atomic, layers, thick, growing, in, thickness, by, outward, diffusion, of, metal, ions, across, the, scale, above, 950, c, volatile, chromium, trioxide, cro, 3, forms, from, the, chromia, scale, limiting, the, scale, thickness, and, oxidation, protection, chromium, unlike, iron, and, nickel, does, not, suffer, from, hydrogen, embrittlement, however, it, does, suffer, from, nitrogen, embrittlement, reacting, with, nitrogen, from, air, and, forming, brittle, nitrides, at, the, high, temperatures, necessary, to, work, the, metal, parts, naturally, occurring, chromium, is, composed, of, four, stable, isotopes, 50, cr, 52, cr, 53, cr, and, 54, cr, with, 52, cr, being, the, most, abundant, 83, 789, natural, abundance, 50, cr, is, observationally, stable, as, it, is, theoretically, capable, of, decaying, to, 50, ti, via, double, electron, capture, with, a, half, life, of, no, less, than, 1, 3, 10, 18, years, twenty, five, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, ranging, from, 42, cr, to, 70, cr, the, most, stable, radioisotope, is, 51, cr, with, a, half, life, of, 27, 7, days, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 24, hours, and, the, majority, less, than, 1, minute, chromium, also, has, two, metastable, nuclear, isomers, the, primary, decay, mode, before, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 52, cr, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, decay, 53, cr, is, the, radiogenic, decay, product, of, 53, mn, half, life, 3, 74, million, years, chromium, isotopes, are, typically, collocated, and, compounded, with, manganese, isotopes, this, circumstance, is, useful, in, isotope, geology, manganese, chromium, isotope, ratios, reinforce, the, evidence, from, 26, al, and, 107, pd, concerning, the, early, history, of, the, solar, system, variations, in, 53, cr, 52, cr, and, mn, cr, ratios, from, several, meteorites, indicate, an, initial, 53, mn, 55, mn, ratio, that, suggests, mn, cr, isotopic, composition, must, result, from, in, situ, decay, of, 53, mn, in, differentiated, planetary, bodies, hence, 53, cr, provides, additional, evidence, for, nucleosynthetic, processes, immediately, before, coalescence, of, the, solar, system, 53, cr, has, been, posited, as, a, proxy, for, atmospheric, oxygen, concentration, chromium, is, a, member, of, group, 6, of, the, transition, metals, the, 3, and, 6, states, occur, most, commonly, within, chromium, compounds, followed, by, 2, charges, of, 1, 4, and, 5, for, chromium, are, rare, but, do, nevertheless, occasionally, exist, many, cr, 0, complexes, are, known, bis, benzene, chromium, and, chromium, hexacarbonyl, are, highlights, in, organochromium, chemistry, chromium, ii, compounds, are, uncommon, in, part, because, they, readily, oxidize, to, chromium, iii, derivatives, in, air, water, stable, chromium, ii, chloride, crcl, 2, that, can, be, made, by, reducing, chromium, iii, chloride, with, zinc, the, resulting, bright, blue, solution, created, from, dissolving, chromium, ii, chloride, is, stable, at, neutral, ph, some, other, notable, chromium, ii, compounds, include, chromium, ii, oxide, cro, and, chromium, ii, sulfate, crso, 4, many, chromium, ii, carboxylates, are, known, the, red, chromium, ii, acetate, cr, 2, o, 2, cch, 3, 4, is, somewhat, famous, it, features, a, cr, cr, quadruple, bond, a, large, number, of, chromium, iii, compounds, are, known, such, as, chromium, iii, nitrate, chromium, iii, acetate, and, chromium, iii, oxide, chromium, iii, can, be, obtained, by, dissolving, elemental, chromium, in, acids, like, hydrochloric, acid, or, sulfuric, acid, but, it, can, also, be, formed, through, the, reduction, of, chromium, vi, by, cytochrome, c7, the, cr, 3, ion, has, a, similar, radius, 63, pm, to, al, 3, radius, 50, pm, and, they, can, replace, each, other, in, some, compounds, such, as, in, chrome, alum, and, alum, chromium, iii, tends, to, form, octahedral, complexes, commercially, available, chromium, iii, chloride, hydrate, is, the, dark, green, complex, cl, closely, related, compounds, are, the, pale, green, cl, 2, and, violet, cl, 3, if, anhydrous, violet, chromium, iii, chloride, is, dissolved, in, water, the, violet, solution, turns, green, after, some, time, as, the, chloride, in, the, inner, coordination, sphere, is, replaced, by, water, this, kind, of, reaction, is, also, observed, with, solutions, of, chrome, alum, and, other, water, soluble, chromium, iii, salts, a, tetrahedral, coordination, of, chromium, iii, has, been, reported, for, the, cr, centered, keggin, anion, 5, chromium, iii, hydroxide, cr, oh, 3, is, amphoteric, dissolving, in, acidic, solutions, to, form, 3, and, in, basic, solutions, to, form, 3, it, is, dehydrated, by, heating, to, form, the, green, chromium, iii, oxide, cr, 2, o, 3, a, stable, oxide, with, a, crystal, structure, identical, to, that, of, corundum, chromium, vi, compounds, are, oxidants, at, low, or, neutral, ph, chromate, anions, cro, 2, 4, and, dichromate, cr, 2, o, 7, 2, anions,

and, chromyl, chloride, cro, 2, cl, 2, however, despite, several, erroneous, claims, chromium, hexafluoride, as, well, as, all, higher, hexahalides, remains, unknown, as, of, 2020, sodium, chromate, is, produced, industrially, by, the, oxidative, roasting, of, chromite, ore, with, sodium, carbonate, the, change, in, equilibrium, is, visible, by, a, change, from, yellow, chromate, to, orange, dichromate, such, as, when, an, acid, is, added, to, a, neutral, solution, of, potassium, chromate, at, yet, lower, ph, values, further, condensation, to, more, complex, oxyanions, of, chromium, is, possible, both, the, chromate, and, dichromate, anions, are, strong, oxidizing, reagents, at, low, ph, they, are, however, only, moderately, oxidizing, at, high, ph, chromium, vi, compounds, in, solution, can, be, detected, by, adding, an, acidic, hydrogen, peroxide, solution, the, unstable, dark, blue, chromium, vi, peroxide, cro, 5, is, formed, which, can, be, stabilized, as, an, ether, adduct, cro, 5, or, 2, chromic, acid, has, the, hypothetical, formula, h, 2, cro, 4, it, is, a, vaguely, described, chemical, despite, many, well, defined, chromates, and, dichromates, being, known, the, dark, red, chromium, vi, oxide, cro, 3, the, acid, anhydride, of, chromic, acid, is, sold, industrially, as, chromic, acid, it, can, be, produced, by, mixing, sulfuric, acid, with, dichromate, and, is, a, strong, oxidizing, agent, compounds, of, chromium, v, are, rather, rare, the, oxidation, state, 5, is, only, realized, in, few, compounds, but, are, intermediates, in, many, reactions, involving, oxidations, by, chromate, the, only, binary, compound, is, the, volatile, chromium, v, fluoride, crf, 5, this, red, solid, has, a, melting, point, of, 30, c, and, a, boiling, point, of, 117, c, it, can, be, prepared, by, treating, chromium, metal, with, fluorine, at, 400, c, and, 200, bar, pressure, the, peroxochromate, v, is, another, example, of, the, 5, oxidation, state, potassium, peroxochromate, k, 3, is, made, by, reacting, potassium, chromate, with, hydrogen, peroxide, at, low, temperatures, this, red, brown, compound, is, stable, at, room, temperature, but, decomposes, spontaneously, at, 150, 170, c, compounds, of, chromium, iv, are, slightly, more, common, than, those, of, chromium, v, the, tetrahalides, crf, 4, crcl, 4, and, crbr, 4, can, be, produced, by, treating, the, trihalides, crx, 3, with, the, corresponding, halogen, at, elevated, temperatures, such, compounds, are, susceptible, to, disproportionation, reactions, and, are, not, stable, in, water, organic, compounds, containing, cr, iv, state, such, as, chromium, tetra, t, butoxide, are, also, known, most, chromium, i, compounds, are, obtained, solely, by, oxidation, of, electron, rich, octahedral, chromium, 0, complexes, other, chromium, i, complexes, contain, cyclopentadienyl, ligands, as, verified, by, x, ray, diffraction, a, cr, cr, quintuple, bond, length, 183, 51, 4, pm, has, also, been, described, extremely, bulky, monodentate, ligands, stabilize, this, compound, by, shielding, the, quintuple, bond, from, further, reactions, chromium, is, the, 21st, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, with, an, average, concentration, of, 100, ppm, it, is, also, the, seventh, most, abundant, element, on, earth, chromium, compounds, are, found, in, the, environment, from, the, erosion, of, chromium, containing, rocks, and, can, be, redistributed, by, volcanic, eruptions, typical, background, concentrations, of, chromium, in, environmental, media, are, atmosphere, 10, ng, m, 3, soil, 500, mg, kg, vegetation, 0, 5, mg, kg, freshwater, 10, g, l, seawater, 1, g, l, sediment, 80, mg, kg, chromium, is, mined, as, chromite, fecr, 2, o, 4, ore, about, two, fifths, of, the, chromite, ores, and, concentrates, in, the, world, are, produced, in, south, africa, about, a, third, in, kazakhstan, while, india, russia, and, turkey, are, also, substantial, producers, untapped, chromite, deposits, are, plentiful, but, geographically, concentrated, in, kazakhstan, and, southern, africa, although, rare, deposits, of, native, chromium, exist, the, udachnaya, pipe, in, russia, produces, samples, of, the, native, metal, this, mine, is, a, kimberlite, pipe, rich, in, diamonds, and, the, reducing, environment, helped, produce, both, elemental, chromium, and, diamonds, the, relation, between, cr, iii, and, cr, vi, strongly, depends, on, ph, and, oxidative, properties, of, the, location, in, most, cases, cr, iii, is, the, dominating, species, but, in, some, areas, the, ground, water, can, contain, up, to, 39, g, l, of, total, chromium, of, which, 30, g, l, is, cr, vi, chromium, minerals, as, pigments, came, to, the, attention, of, the, west, in, the, eighteenth, century, on, 26, july, 1761, johann, gottlob, lehmann, found, an, orange, red, mineral, in, the, beryozovskoye, mines, in, the, ural, mountains, which, he, named, siberian, red, lead, though, misidentified, as, a, lead, compound, with, selenium, and, iron, components, the, mineral, was, in, fact, crocoite, with, a, formula, of, pbcro, 4, in, 1770, peter, simon, pallas, visited, the, same, site, as, lehmann, and, found, a, red, lead, mineral, that, was, discovered, to, possess, useful, properties, as, a, pigment, in, paints, after, pallas, the, use, of, siberian, red, lead, as, a, paint, pigment, began, to, develop, rapidly, throughout, the, region, crocoite, would, be, the, principal, source, of, chromium, in, pigments, until, the, discovery, of, chromite, many, years, later, in, 1794, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, received, samples, of, crocoite, ore, he, produced, chromium, trioxide, cro, 3, by, mixing, crocoite, with, hydrochloric, acid, in, 1797, vauquelin, discovered, that, he, could, isolate, metallic, chromium, by, heating, the, oxide, in, a, charcoal, oven, for, which, he, is, credited, as, the, one, who, truly, discovered, the, element, vauquelin, was, also, able, to, detect, traces, of, chromium, in, precious, gemstones, such, as, ruby, and, emerald, during, the, nineteenth, century, chromium, was, primarily, used, not, only, as, a, component, of, paints, but, in, tanning, salts, as, well, for, quite, some, time, the, crocoite, found, in, russia, was, the, main, source, for, such, tanning, materials, in, 1827, a, larger, chromite, deposit, was, discovered, near, baltimore, united, states, which, quickly, met, the, demand, for, tanning, salts, much, more, adequately, than, the, crocoite, that, had, been, used, previously, this, made, the, united, states, the, largest, producer, of, chromium, products, until, the, year, 1848, when, larger, deposits, of, chromite, were, uncovered, near, the, city, of, bursa, turkey, with, the, development, of, metallurgy, and, chemical, industries, in, the, western, world, the, need, for, chromium, increased, chromium, is, also, famous, for, its, reflective, metallic, luster, when, polished, it, is, used, as, a, protective, and, decorative, coating, on, car, parts, plumbing, fixtures, furniture, parts, and, many, other, items, usually, applied, by, electroplating, chromium, was, used, for, electroplating, as, early, as, 1848, but, this, use, only, became, widespread, with, the, development, of, an, improved, process, in, 1924, approximately, 28, 8, million, metric, tons, mt, of, marketable, chromite, ore, was, produced, in, 2013, and, converted, into, 7, 5, mt, of, ferrochromium, according, to, john, f, papp, writing, for, the, usgs, ferrochromium, is, the, leading, end, use, of, chromite, ore, stainless, steel, is, the, leading, end, use, of, ferrochromium, the, largest, producers, of, chromium, ore, in, 2013, have, been, south, africa, 48, kazakhstan, 13, turkey, 11, and, india, 10, with, several, other, countries, producing, the, rest, of, about, 18, of, the, world, production, the, two, main, products, of, chromium, ore, refining, are, ferrochromium, and, metallic, chromium, for, those, products, the, ore, smelter, process, differs, considerably, for, the, production, of, ferrochromium, the, chromite, ore, fecr, 2, o, 4, is, reduced, in, large, scale, in, electric, arc, furnace, or, in, smaller, smelters, with, either, aluminium, or, silicon, in, an, aluminothermic, reaction, for, the, production, of, pure, chromium, the, iron, must, be, separated, from, the, chromium, in, a, two, step, roasting, and, leaching, process, the, chromite, ore, is, heated, with, a, mixture, of, calcium, carbonate, and, sodium, carbonate, in, the, presence, of, air, the, chromium, is, oxidized, to, the, hexavalent, form, while, the, iron, forms, the, stable, fe, 2, o, 3, the, subsequent, leaching, at, higher, elevated, temperatures, dissolves, the, chromates, and, leaves, the, insoluble, iron, oxide, the, chromate, is, converted, by, sulfuric, acid, into, the, dichromate, the, dichromate, is, converted, to, the, chromium, iii, oxide, by, reduction, with, carbon, and, then, reduced, in, an, aluminothermic, reaction, to, chromium, the, creation, of, metal, alloys, account, for, 85, of, the, available, chromium, s, usage, the, remainder, of, chromium, is, used, in, the, chemical, refractory, and, foundry, industries, the, strengthening, effect, of, forming, stable, metal, carbides, at, grain, boundaries, and, the, strong, increase, in, corrosion, resistance, made, chromium, an, important, alloying, material, for, steel, high, speed, tool, steels, contain, 3, 5, chromium, stainless, steel, the, primary, corrosion, resistant, metal, alloy, is, formed, when, chromium, is, introduced, to, iron, in, concentrations, above, 11, for, stainless, steel, s, formation, ferrochromium, is, added, to, the, molten, iron, also, nickel, based, alloys, have, increased, strength, due, to, the, formation, of, discrete, stable, metal, carbide, particles, at, the, grain, boundaries, for, example, inconel, 718, contains, 18, 6, chromium, because, of, the, excellent, high, temperature, properties, of, these, nickel, superalloys, they, are, used, in, jet, engines, and, gas, turbines, in, lieu, of, common, structural, materials, astm, b163, relies, on, chromium, for, condenser, and, heat, exchanger, tubes, while, castings, with, high, strength, at, elevated, temperatures, that, contain, chromium, are, standardised, with, astm, a567, aisi, type, 332, is, used, where, high, temperature, would, normally, cause, carburization, oxidation, or, corrosion, incoloy, 800, is, capable, of, remaining, stable, and, maintaining, its, austenitic, structure, even, after, long, time, exposures, to, high, temperatures, nichrome, is, used, as, resistance, wire, for, heating, elements, in, things, like, toasters, and, space, heaters, these, uses, make, chromium, a, strategic, material, consequently, during, world, war, ii, u, s, road, engineers, were, instructed, to, avoid, chromium, in, yellow, road, paint, as, it, may, become, a, critical, material, during, the, emergency, the, united, states, likewise, considered, chromium, essential, for, the, german, war, industry, and, made, intense, diplomatic, efforts, to, keep, it, out, of, the, hands, of, nazi, germany, the, high, hardness, and, corrosion, resistance, of, unalloyed, chromium, makes, it, a, reliable, metal, for, surface, coating, it, is, still, the, most, popular, metal, for, sheet, coating, with, its, above, average, durability, compared, to, other, coating, metals, a, layer, of, chromium, is, deposited, on, pretreated, metallic, surfaces, by, electroplating, techniques, there, are, two, deposition, methods, thin, and, thick, thin, deposition, involves, a, layer, of, chromium, below, 1, m, thickness, deposited, by, chrome, plating, and, is, used, for, decorative, surfaces, thicker, chromium, layers, are, deposited, if, wear, resistant, surfaces, are, needed, both, methods, use, acidic, chromate, or, dichromate, solutions, to, prevent, the, energy, consuming, change, in, oxidation, state, the, use, of, chromium, iii, sulfate, is, under, development, for, most, applications, of, chromium, the, previously, established, process, is, used, in, the, chromate, conversion, coating, process, the, strong, oxidative, properties, of, chromates, are, used, to, deposit, a, protective, oxide, layer, on, metals, like, aluminium, zinc, and, cadmium, this, passivation, and, the, self, healing, properties, of, the, chromate, stored, in, the, chromate, conversion, coating, which, is, able, to, migrate, to, local, defects, are, the, benefits, of, this, coating, method, because, of, environmental, and, health, regulations, on, chromates, alternative, coating, methods, are, under, development, chromic, acid, anodizing, or, type, i, anodizing, of, aluminium, is, another, electrochemical, process, that, does, not, lead, to, the, deposition, of, chromium, but, uses, chromic, acid, as, an, electrolyte, in, the, solution, during, anodization, an, oxide, layer, is, formed, on, the, aluminium, the, use, of, chromic, acid, instead, of, the, normally, used, sulfuric, acid, leads, to, a, slight, difference, of, these, oxide, layers, the, high, toxicity, of, cr, vi, compounds, used, in, the, established, chromium, electroplating, process, and, the, strengthening, of, safety, and, environmental, regulations, demand, a, search, for, substitutes, for, chromium, or, at, least, a, change, to, less, toxic, chromium, iii, compounds, the, mineral, crocoite, which, is, also, lead, chromate, pbcro, 4, was, used, as, a, yellow, pigment, shortly, after, its, discovery, after, a, synthesis, method, became, available, starting, from, the, more, abundant, chromite, chrome, yellow, was, together, with, cadmium, yellow, one, of, the, most, used, yellow, pigments, the, pigment, does, not, photodegrade, but, it, tends, to, darken, due, to, the, formation, of, chromium, iii, oxide, it, has, a, strong, color, and, was, used, for, school, buses, in, the, united, states, and, for, the, postal, services, for, example, the, deutsche, post, in, europe, the, use, of, chrome, yellow, has, since, declined, due, to, environmental, and, safety, concerns, and, was, replaced, by, organic, pigments, or, other, alternatives, that, are, free, from, lead, and, chromium, other, pigments, that, are, based, around, chromium, are, for, example, the, deep, shade, of, red, pigment, chrome, red, which, is, simply, lead, chromate, with, lead, ii, hydroxide, pbcro, 4, pb, oh, 2, a, very, important, chromate, pigment, which, was, used, widely, in, metal, primer, formulations, was, zinc, chromate, now, replaced, by, zinc, phosphate, a, wash, primer, was, formulated, to, replace, the, dangerous, practice, of, pre, treating, aluminium, aircraft, bodies, with, a, phosphoric, acid, solution, this, used, zinc, tetroxychromate, dispersed, in, a, solution, of, polyvinyl, butyral, an, 8, solution, of, phosphoric, acid, in, solvent, was, added, just, before, application, it, was, found, that, an, easily, oxidized, alcohol, was, an, essential, ingredient, a, thin, layer, of, about, 10, 15, m, was, applied, which, turned, from, yellow, to, dark, green, when, it, was, cured, there, is, still, a, question, as, to, the, correct, mechanism, chrome, green, is, a, mixture, of, prussian, blue, and, chrome, yellow, while, the, chrome, oxide, green, is, chromium, iii, oxide, chromium, oxides, are, also, used, as, a, green, pigment, in, the, field, of, glassmaking, and, also, as, a, glaze, for, ceramics, green, chromium, oxide, is, extremely, lightfast, and, as, such, is, used, in, cladding, coatings, it, is, also, the, main, ingredient, in, infrared, reflecting, paints, used, by, the, armed, forces, to, paint, vehicles, and, to, give, them, the, same, infrared, reflectance, as, green, leaves, chromium, iii, ions, present, in, corundum, crystals, aluminium, oxide, cause, them, to, be, colored, red, when, corundum, appears, as, such, it, is, known, as, a, ruby, if, the, corundum, is, lacking, in, chromium, iii, ions, it, is, known, as, a, sapphire, a, red, colored, artificial, ruby, may, also, be, achieved, by, doping, chromium, iii, into, artificial, corundum, crystals, thus, making, chromium, a, requirement, for, making, synthetic, rubies, such, a, synthetic, ruby, crystal, was, the, basis, for, the, first, laser, produced, in, 1960, which, relied, on, stimulated, emission, of, light, from, the, chromium, atoms, in, such, a, crystal, ruby, has, a, laser, transition, at, 694, 3, nanometers, in, a, deep, red, color, chromium, vi, salts, are, used, for, the, preservation, of, wood, for, example, chromated, copper, arsenate, cca, is, used, in, timber, treatment, to, protect, wood, from, decay, fungi, wood, attacking, insects, including, termites, and, marine, borers, the, formulations, contain, chromium, based, on, the, oxide, cro, 3, between, 35, 3, and, 65, 5, in, the, united, states, 65, 300, metric, tons, of, cca, solution, were, used, in, 1996, chromium, iii, salts, especially, chrome, alum, and, chromium, iii, sulfate, are, used, in, the, tanning, of, leather, the, chromium, iii, stabilizes, the, leather, by, cross, linking, the, collagen, fibers, chromium, tanned, leather, can, contain, 4, 5, of, chromium, which, is, tightly, bound, to, the, proteins, although, the, form, of, chromium, used, for, tanning, is, not, the, toxic, hexavalent, variety, there, remains, interest, in, management, of, chromium, in, the, tanning, industry, recovery, and, reuse, direct, indirect, recycling, and, chrome, less, or, chrome, free, tanning, are, practiced, to, better, manage, chromium, usage, the, high, heat, resistivity, and, high, melting, point, makes, chromite, and, chromium, iii, oxide, a, material, for, high, temperature, refractory, applications, like, blast, furnaces, cement, kilns, molds, for, the, firing, of, bricks, and, as, foundry, sands, for, the, casting, of, metals, in, these, applications, the, refractory, materials, are, made, from, mixtures, of, chromite, and, magnesite, the, use, is, declining, because, of, the, environmental, regulations, due, to, the, possibility, of, the, formation, of, chromium, vi, several, chromium, compounds, are, used, as, catalysts, for, processing, hydrocarbons, for, example, the, phillips, catalyst, prepared, from, chromium, oxides, is, used, for, the, production, of, about, half, the, world, s, polyethylene, fe, cr, mixed, oxides, are, employed, as, high, temperature, catalysts, for, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, copper, chromite, is, a, useful, hydrogenation, catalyst, the, biologically, beneficial, effects, of, chromium, iii, are, debated, chromium, is, accepted, by, the, u, s, national, institutes, of, health, as, a, trace, element, for, its, roles, in, the, action, of, insulin, a, hormone, that, mediates, the, metabolism, and, storage, of, carbohydrate, fat, and, protein, the, mechanism, of, its, actions, in, the, body, however, have, not, been, defined, leaving, in, question, the, essentiality, of, chromium, in, contrast, hexavalent, chromium, cr, vi, or, cr, 6, is, highly, toxic, and, mutagenic, ingestion, of, chromium, vi, in, water, has, been, linked, to, stomach, tumors, and, it, may, also, cause, allergic, contact, dermatitis, acd, chromium, deficiency, involving, a, lack, of, cr, iii, in, the, body, or, perhaps, some, complex, of, it, such, as, glucose, tolerance, factor, is, controversial, some, studies, suggest, that, the, biologically, active, form, of, chromium, iii, is, transported, in, the, body, via, an, oligopeptide, called, low, molecular, weight, chromium, binding, substance, lmwcr, which, might, play, a, role, in, the, insulin, signaling, pathway, the, chromium, content, of, common, foods, is, generally, low, 1, 13, micrograms, per, serving, the, chromium, content, of, food, varies, widely, due, to, differences, in, soil, mineral, content, growing, season, plant, cultivar, and, contamination, during, processing, chromium, and, nickel, leach, into, food, cooked, in, stainless, steel, with, the, effect, being, largest, when, the, cookware, is, new, acidic, foods, that, are, cooked, for, many, hours, also, exacerbate, this, effect, there, is, disagreement, on, chromium, s, status, as, an, essential, nutrient, governmental, departments, from, australia, new, zealand, india, japan, and, the, united, states, consider, chromium, essential, while, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, of, the, european, union, does, not, the, u, s, national, academy, of, medicine, nam, updated, the, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, the, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, for, chromium, in, 2001, for, chromium, there, was, insufficient, information, to, set, ears, and, rdas, so, its, needs, are, described, as, estimates, for, adequate, intakes, ais, the, current, ais, of, chromium, for, women, ages, 14, through, 50, is, 25, g, day, and, the, ais, for, women, ages, 50, and, above, is, 20, g, day, the, ais, for, women, who, are, pregnant, are, 30, g, day, and, for, women, who, are, lactating,

day, for, adults, including, women, who, are, pregnant, or, lactating, a, ul, has, not, been, set, the, efsa, of, the, european, union, however, does, not, consider, chromium, to, be, an, essential, nutrient, chromium, is, the, only, mineral, for, which, the, united, states, and, the, european, union, disagree, for, u, s, food, and, dietary, supplement, labeling, purposes, the, amount, of, the, substance, in, a, serving, is, expressed, as, a, percent, of, the, daily, value, dv, for, chromium, labeling, purposes, 100, of, the, daily, value, was, 120, g, as, of, 27, may, 2016, the, percentage, of, daily, value, was, revised, to, 35, g, to, bring, the, chromium, intake, into, a, consensus, with, the, official, recommended, dietary, allowance, a, table, of, the, old, and, new, adult, daily, values, is, provided, at, reference, daily, intake, food, composition, databases, such, as, those, maintained, by, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, do, not, contain, information, on, the, chromium, content, of, foods, a, wide, variety, of, animal, and, vegetable, foods, contain, chromium, content, per, serving, is, influenced, by, the, chromium, content, of, the, soil, in, which, the, plants, are, grown, by, foodstuffs, fed, to, animals, and, by, processing, methods, as, chromium, is, leached, into, foods, if, processed, or, cooked, in, stainless, steel, equipment, one, diet, analysis, study, conducted, in, mexico, reported, an, average, daily, chromium, intake, of, 30, micrograms, an, estimated, 31, of, adults, in, the, united, states, consume, multi, vitamin, mineral, dietary, supplements, which, often, contain, 25, to, 60, micrograms, of, chromium, chromium, is, an, ingredient, in, total, parenteral, nutrition, tpn, because, deficiency, can, occur, after, months, of, intravenous, feeding, with, chromium, free, tpn, it, is, also, added, to, nutritional, products, for, preterm, infants, although, the, mechanism, of, action, in, biological, roles, for, chromium, is, unclear, in, the, united, states, chromium, containing, products, are, sold, as, non, prescription, dietary, supplements, in, amounts, ranging, from, 50, to, 1, 000, g, lower, amounts, of, chromium, are, also, often, incorporated, into, multi, vitamin, mineral, supplements, consumed, by, an, estimated, 31, of, adults, in, the, united, states, chemical, compounds, used, in, dietary, supplements, include, chromium, chloride, chromium, citrate, chromium, iii, picolinate, chromium, iii, polynicotinate, and, other, chemical, compositions, the, benefit, of, supplements, has, not, been, proven, in, 2005, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, had, approved, a, qualified, health, claim, for, chromium, picolinate, with, a, requirement, for, very, specific, label, wording, one, small, study, suggests, that, chromium, picolinate, may, reduce, the, risk, of, insulin, resistance, and, therefore, possibly, may, reduce, the, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, fda, concludes, however, that, the, existence, of, such, a, relationship, between, chromium, picolinate, and, either, insulin, resistance, or, type, 2, diabetes, is, highly, uncertain, at, the, same, time, in, answer, to, other, parts, of, the, petition, the, fda, rejected, claims, for, chromium, picolinate, and, cardiovascular, disease, retinopathy, or, kidney, disease, caused, by, abnormally, high, blood, sugar, levels, in, 2010, chromium, iii, picolinate, was, approved, by, health, canada, to, be, used, in, dietary, supplements, approved, labeling, statements, include, a, factor, in, the, maintenance, of, good, health, provides, support, for, healthy, glucose, metabolism, helps, the, body, to, metabolize, carbohydrates, and, helps, the, body, to, metabolize, fats, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, approved, claims, in, 2010, that, chromium, contributed, to, normal, macronutrient, metabolism, and, maintenance, of, normal, blood, glucose, concentration, but, rejected, claims, for, maintenance, or, achievement, of, a, normal, body, weight, or, reduction, of, tiredness, or, fatigue, given, the, evidence, for, chromium, deficiency, causing, problems, with, glucose, management, in, the, context, of, intravenous, nutrition, products, formulated, without, chromium, research, interest, turned, to, whether, chromium, supplementation, would, benefit, people, who, have, type, 2, diabetes, but, are, not, chromium, deficient, looking, at, the, results, from, four, meta, analyses, one, reported, a, statistically, significant, decrease, in, fasting, plasma, glucose, levels, fpg, and, a, non, significant, trend, in, lower, hemoglobin, a1c, a, second, reported, the, same, a, third, reported, significant, decreases, for, both, measures, while, a, fourth, reported, no, benefit, for, either, a, review, published, in, 2016, listed, 53, randomized, clinical, trials, that, were, included, in, one, or, more, of, six, meta, analyses, it, concluded, that, whereas, there, may, be, modest, decreases, in, fpg, and, or, hba1c, that, achieve, statistical, significance, in, some, of, these, meta, analyses, few, of, the, trials, achieved, decreases, large, enough, to, be, expected, to, be, relevant, to, clinical, outcome, two, systematic, reviews, looked, at, chromium, supplements, as, a, mean, of, managing, body, weight, in, overweight, and, obese, people, one, limited, to, chromium, picolinate, a, popular, supplement, ingredient, reported, a, statistically, significant, 1, 1, kg, 2, 4, lb, weight, loss, in, trials, longer, than, 12, weeks, the, other, included, all, chromium, compounds, and, reported, a, statistically, significant, 0, 50, kg, 1, 1, lb, weight, change, change, in, percent, body, fat, did, not, reach, statistical, significance, authors, of, both, reviews, considered, the, clinical, relevance, of, this, modest, weight, loss, as, uncertain, unreliable, the, european, food, safety, authority, reviewed, the, literature, and, concluded, that, there, was, insufficient, evidence, to, support, a, claim, chromium, is, promoted, as, a, sports, performance, dietary, supplement, based, on, the, theory, that, it, potentiates, insulin, activity, with, anticipated, results, of, increased, muscle, mass, and, faster, recovery, of, glycogen, storage, during, post, exercise, recovery, a, review, of, clinical, trials, reported, that, chromium, supplementation, did, not, improve, exercise, performance, or, increase, muscle, strength, the, international, olympic, committee, reviewed, dietary, supplements, for, high, performance, athletes, in, 2018, and, concluded, there, was, no, need, to, increase, chromium, intake, for, athletes, nor, support, for, claims, of, losing, body, fat, irrigation, water, standards, for, chromium, are, 0, 1, mg, l, but, some, rivers, in, bangladesh, are, more, than, five, times, that, amount, the, standard, for, fish, for, human, consumption, is, less, than, 1, mg, kg, but, many, tested, samples, were, more, than, five, times, that, amount, chromium, especially, hexavalent, chromium, is, highly, toxic, to, fish, because, it, is, easily, absorbed, across, the, gills, readily, enters, blood, circulation, crosses, cell, membranes, and, bioconcentrates, up, the, food, chain, in, contrast, the, toxicity, of, trivalent, chromium, is, very, low, attributed, to, poor, membrane, permeability, and, little, biomagnification, acute, and, chronic, exposure, to, chromium, vi, affects, fish, behavior, physiology, reproduction, and, survival, hyperactivity, and, erratic, swimming, have, been, reported, in, contaminated, environments, egg, hatching, and, fingerling, survival, are, affected, in, adult, fish, there, are, reports, of, histopathological, damage, to, liver, kidney, muscle, intestines, and, gills, mechanisms, include, mutagenic, gene, damage, and, disruptions, of, enzyme, functions, there, is, evidence, that, fish, may, not, require, chromium, but, benefit, from, a, measured, amount, in, diet, in, one, study, juvenile, fish, gained, weight, on, a, zero, chromium, diet, but, the, addition, of, 500, g, of, chromium, in, the, form, of, chromium, chloride, or, other, supplement, types, per, kilogram, of, food, dry, weight, increased, weight, gain, at, 2, 000, g, kg, the, weight, gain, was, no, better, than, with, the, zero, chromium, diet, and, there, were, increased, dna, strand, breaks, water, insoluble, chromium, iii, compounds, and, chromium, metal, are, not, considered, a, health, hazard, while, the, toxicity, and, carcinogenic, properties, of, chromium, vi, have, been, known, for, a, long, time, because, of, the, specific, transport, mechanisms, only, limited, amounts, of, chromium, iii, enter, the, cells, acute, oral, toxicity, ranges, between, 50, and, 150, mg, kg, a, 2008, review, suggested, that, moderate, uptake, of, chromium, iii, through, dietary, supplements, poses, no, genetic, toxic, risk, in, the, us, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, designated, an, air, permissible, exposure, limit, pel, in, the, workplace, as, a, time, weighted, average, twa, of, 1, mg, m, 3, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 0, 5, mg, m, 3, time, weighted, average, the, idlh, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, value, is, 250, mg, m, 3, the, acute, oral, toxicity, for, chromium, vi, ranges, between, 1, 5, and, 3, 3, mg, kg, in, the, body, chromium, vi, is, reduced, by, several, mechanisms, to, chromium, iii, already, in, the, blood, before, it, enters, the, cells, the, chromium, iii, is, excreted, from, the, body, whereas, the, chromate, ion, is, transferred, into, the, cell, by, a, transport, mechanism, by, which, also, sulfate, and, phosphate, ions, enter, the, cell, the, acute, toxicity, of, chromium, vi, is, due, to, its, strong, oxidant, properties, after, it, reaches, the, blood, stream, it, damages, the, kidneys, the, liver, and, blood, cells, through, oxidation, reactions, hemolysis, renal, and, liver, failure, result, aggressive, dialysis, can, be, therapeutic, the, carcinogenity, of, chromate, dust, has, been, known, for, a, long, time, and, in, 1890, the, first, publication, described, the, elevated, cancer, risk, of, workers, in, a, chromate, dye, company, three, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, to, describe, the, genotoxicity, of, chromium, vi, the, first, mechanism, includes, highly, reactive, hydroxyl, radicals, and, other, reactive, radicals, which, are, by, products, of, the, reduction, of, chromium, vi, to, chromium, iii, the, second, process, includes, the, direct, binding, of, chromium, v, produced, by, reduction, in, the, cell, and, chromium, iv, compounds, to, the, dna, the, last, mechanism, attributed, the, genotoxicity, to, the, binding, to, the, dna, of, the, end, product, of, the, chromium, iii, reduction, chromium, salts, chromates, are, also, the, cause, of, allergic, reactions, in, some, people, chromates, are, often, used, to, manufacture, amongst, other, things, leather, products, paints, cement, mortar, and, anti, corrosives, contact, with, products, containing, chromates, can, lead, to, allergic, contact, dermatitis, and, irritant, dermatitis, resulting, in, ulceration, of, the, skin, sometimes, referred, to, as, chrome, ulcers, this, condition, is, often, found, in, workers, that, have, been, exposed, to, strong, chromate, solutions, in, electroplating, tanning, and, chrome, producing, manufacturers, because, chromium, compounds, were, used, in, dyes, paints, and, leather, tanning, compounds, these, compounds, are, often, found, in, soil, and, groundwater, at, active, and, abandoned, industrial, sites, needing, environmental, cleanup, and, remediation, primer, paint, containing, hexavalent, chromium, is, still, widely, used, for, aerospace, and, automobile, refinishing, applications, in, 2010, the, environmental, working, group, studied, the, drinking, water, in, 35, american, cities, in, the, first, nationwide, study, the, study, found, measurable, hexavalent, chromium, in, the, tap, water, of, 31, of, the, cities, sampled, with, norman, oklahoma, at, the, top, of, list, 25, cities, had, levels, that, exceeded, california, s, proposed, limit, the, more, toxic, hexavalent, chromium, form, can, be, reduced, to, the, less, soluble, trivalent, oxidation, state, in, soils, by, organic, matter, ferrous, iron, sulfides, and, other, reducing, agents, with, the, rates, of, such, reduction, being, faster, under, more, acidic, conditions, than, under, more, alkaline, ones, in, contrast, trivalent, chromium, can, be, oxidized, to, hexavalent, chromium, in, soils, by, manganese, oxides, such, as, mn, iii, and, mn, iv, compounds, since, the, solubility, and, toxicity, of, chromium, vi, are, greater, that, those, of, chromium, iii, the, oxidation, reduction, conversions, between, the, two, oxidation, states, have, implications, for, movement, and, bioavailability, of, chromium, in, soils, groundwater, and, plants
