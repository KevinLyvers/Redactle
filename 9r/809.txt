physics, is, the, natural, science, of, matter, involving, the, study, of, matter, its, fundamental, constituents, its, motion, and, behavior, through, space, and, time, and, the, related, entities, of, energy, and, force, physics, is, one, of, the, most, fundamental, scientific, disciplines, a, scientist, who, specializes, in, the, field, of, physics, is, called, a, physicist, physics, is, one, of, the, oldest, academic, disciplines, and, through, its, inclusion, of, astronomy, perhaps, the, oldest, over, much, of, the, past, two, millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and, certain, branches, of, mathematics, were, a, part, of, natural, philosophy, but, during, the, scientific, revolution, in, the, 17th, century, these, natural, sciences, branched, into, separate, research, endeavors, physics, intersects, with, many, interdisciplinary, areas, of, research, such, as, biophysics, and, quantum, chemistry, and, the, boundaries, of, physics, are, not, rigidly, defined, new, ideas, in, physics, often, explain, the, fundamental, mechanisms, studied, by, other, sciences, and, suggest, new, avenues, of, research, in, these, and, other, academic, disciplines, such, as, mathematics, and, philosophy, advances, in, physics, often, enable, new, technologies, for, example, advances, in, the, understanding, of, electromagnetism, solid, state, physics, and, nuclear, physics, led, directly, to, the, development, of, new, products, that, have, dramatically, transformed, modern, day, society, such, as, television, computers, domestic, appliances, and, nuclear, weapons, advances, in, thermodynamics, led, to, the, development, of, industrialization, and, advances, in, mechanics, inspired, the, development, of, calculus, the, word, physics, comes, from, the, latin, physica, study, of, nature, which, itself, is, a, borrowing, of, the, greek, phusik, natural, science, a, term, derived, from, ph, sis, origin, nature, property, astronomy, is, one, of, the, oldest, natural, sciences, early, civilizations, dating, before, 3000, bce, such, as, the, sumerians, ancient, egyptians, and, the, indus, valley, civilisation, had, a, predictive, knowledge, and, a, basic, awareness, of, the, motions, of, the, sun, moon, and, stars, the, stars, and, planets, believed, to, represent, gods, were, often, worshipped, while, the, explanations, for, the, observed, positions, of, the, stars, were, often, unscientific, and, lacking, in, evidence, these, early, observations, laid, the, foundation, for, later, astronomy, as, the, stars, were, found, to, traverse, great, circles, across, the, sky, which, could, not, explain, the, positions, of, the, planets, according, to, asger, aaboe, the, origins, of, western, astronomy, can, be, found, in, mesopotamia, and, all, western, efforts, in, the, exact, sciences, are, descended, from, late, babylonian, astronomy, egyptian, astronomers, left, monuments, showing, knowledge, of, the, constellations, and, the, motions, of, the, celestial, bodies, while, greek, poet, homer, wrote, of, various, celestial, objects, in, his, iliad, and, odyssey, later, greek, astronomers, provided, names, which, are, still, used, today, for, most, constellations, visible, from, the, northern, hemisphere, natural, philosophy, has, its, origins, in, greece, during, the, archaic, period, 650, bce, 480, bce, when, pre, socratic, philosophers, like, thales, rejected, non, naturalistic, explanations, for, natural, phenomena, and, proclaimed, that, every, event, had, a, natural, cause, they, proposed, ideas, verified, by, reason, and, observation, and, many, of, their, hypotheses, proved, successful, in, experiment, for, example, atomism, was, found, to, be, correct, approximately, 2000, years, after, it, was, proposed, by, leucippus, and, his, pupil, democritus, during, the, classical, period, in, greece, 6th, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, and, in, hellenistic, times, natural, philosophy, developed, along, many, lines, of, inquiry, aristotle, greek, aristot, l, s, 384, 322, bce, a, student, of, plato, wrote, on, many, subjects, including, a, substantial, treatise, on, physics, in, the, 4th, century, bc, aristotelian, physics, was, influential, for, about, two, millennia, his, approach, mixed, some, limited, observation, with, logical, deductive, arguments, but, did, not, rely, on, experimental, verification, of, deduced, statements, aristotle, s, foundational, work, in, physics, though, very, imperfect, formed, a, framework, against, which, later, thinkers, further, developed, the, field, his, approach, is, entirely, superseded, today, he, explained, ideas, such, as, motion, and, gravity, with, the, theory, of, four, elements, aristotle, believed, that, each, of, the, four, classical, elements, air, fire, water, earth, had, its, own, natural, place, because, of, their, differing, densities, each, element, will, revert, to, its, own, specific, place, in, the, atmosphere, so, because, of, their, weights, fire, would, be, at, the, top, air, underneath, fire, then, water, then, lastly, earth, he, also, stated, that, when, a, small, amount, of, one, element, enters, the, natural, place, of, another, the, less, abundant, element, will, automatically, go, towards, its, own, natural, place, for, example, if, there, is, a, fire, on, the, ground, the, flames, go, up, into, the, air, in, an, attempt, to, go, back, into, its, natural, place, where, it, belongs, his, laws, of, motion, included, 1, heavier, objects, will, fall, faster, the, speed, being, proportional, to, the, weight, and, 2, the, speed, of, the, object, that, is, falling, depends, inversely, on, the, density, object, it, is, falling, through, e, g, density, of, air, he, also, stated, that, when, it, comes, to, violent, motion, motion, of, an, object, when, a, force, is, applied, to, it, by, a, second, object, that, the, speed, that, object, moves, will, only, be, as, fast, or, strong, as, the, measure, of, force, applied, to, it, the, problem, of, motion, and, its, causes, was, studied, carefully, leading, to, the, philosophical, notion, of, a, primer, mover, as, the, ultimate, source, of, all, motion, in, the, world, book, 8, of, his, treatise, physics, the, western, roman, empire, fell, to, invaders, and, internal, decay, in, the, fifth, century, resulting, in, a, decline, in, intellectual, pursuits, in, western, europe, by, contrast, the, eastern, roman, empire, usually, known, as, the, byzantine, empire, resisted, the, attacks, from, invaders, and, continued, to, advance, various, fields, of, learning, including, physics, in, the, sixth, century, isidore, of, miletus, created, an, important, compilation, of, archimedes, works, that, are, copied, in, the, archimedes, palimpsest, in, sixth, century, europe, john, philoponus, a, byzantine, scholar, questioned, aristotle, s, teaching, of, physics, and, noted, its, flaws, he, introduced, the, theory, of, impetus, aristotle, s, physics, was, not, scrutinized, until, philoponus, appeared, unlike, aristotle, who, based, his, physics, on, verbal, argument, philoponus, relied, on, observation, on, aristotle, s, physics, philoponus, wrote, but, this, is, completely, erroneous, and, our, view, may, be, corroborated, by, actual, observation, more, effectively, than, by, any, sort, of, verbal, argument, for, if, you, let, fall, from, the, same, height, two, weights, of, which, one, is, many, times, as, heavy, as, the, other, you, will, see, that, the, ratio, of, the, times, required, for, the, motion, does, not, depend, on, the, ratio, of, the, weights, but, that, the, difference, in, time, is, a, very, small, one, and, so, if, the, difference, in, the, weights, is, not, considerable, that, is, of, one, is, let, us, say, double, the, other, there, will, be, no, difference, or, else, an, imperceptible, difference, in, time, though, the, difference, in, weight, is, by, no, means, negligible, with, one, body, weighing, twice, as, much, as, the, other, philoponus, criticism, of, aristotelian, principles, of, physics, served, as, an, inspiration, for, galileo, galilei, ten, centuries, later, during, the, scientific, revolution, galileo, cited, philoponus, substantially, in, his, works, when, arguing, that, aristotelian, physics, was, flawed, in, the, 1300s, jean, buridan, a, teacher, in, the, faculty, of, arts, at, the, university, of, paris, developed, the, concept, of, impetus, it, was, a, step, toward, the, modern, ideas, of, inertia, and, momentum, islamic, scholarship, inherited, aristotelian, physics, from, the, greeks, and, during, the, islamic, golden, age, developed, it, further, especially, placing, emphasis, on, observation, and, a, priori, reasoning, developing, early, forms, of, the, scientific, method, the, most, notable, innovations, under, islamic, scholarship, were, in, the, field, of, optics, and, vision, which, came, from, the, works, of, many, scientists, like, ibn, sahl, al, kindi, ibn, al, haytham, al, farisi, and, avicenna, the, most, notable, work, was, the, book, of, optics, also, known, as, kit, b, al, man, ir, written, by, ibn, al, haytham, in, which, he, presented, the, alternative, to, the, ancient, greek, idea, about, vision, in, his, treatise, on, light, as, well, as, in, his, kit, b, al, man, ir, he, presented, a, study, of, the, phenomenon, of, the, camera, obscura, his, thousand, year, old, version, of, the, pinhole, camera, and, delved, further, into, the, way, the, eye, itself, works, using, the, knowledge, of, previous, scholars, he, began, to, explain, how, light, enters, the, eye, he, asserted, that, the, light, ray, is, focused, but, the, actual, explanation, of, how, light, projected, to, the, back, of, the, eye, had, to, wait, until, 1604, his, treatise, on, light, explained, the, camera, obscura, hundreds, of, years, before, the, modern, development, of, photography, the, seven, volume, book, of, optics, kitab, al, manathir, influenced, thinking, across, disciplines, from, the, theory, of, visual, perception, to, the, nature, of, perspective, in, medieval, art, in, both, the, east, and, the, west, for, more, than, 600, years, this, included, later, european, scholars, and, fellow, polymaths, from, robert, grosseteste, and, leonardo, da, vinci, to, johannes, kepler, the, translation, of, the, book, of, optics, had, an, impact, on, europe, from, it, later, european, scholars, were, able, to, build, devices, that, replicated, those, ibn, al, haytham, had, built, and, understand, the, way, vision, works, physics, became, a, separate, science, when, early, modern, europeans, used, experimental, and, quantitative, methods, to, discover, what, are, now, considered, to, be, the, laws, of, physics, major, developments, in, this, period, include, the, replacement, of, the, geocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, with, the, heliocentric, copernican, model, the, laws, governing, the, motion, of, planetary, bodies, determined, by, kepler, between, 1609, and, 1619, galileo, s, pioneering, work, on, telescopes, and, observational, astronomy, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, and, isaac, newton, s, discovery, and, unification, of, the, laws, of, motion, and, universal, gravitation, that, would, come, to, bear, his, name, newton, also, developed, calculus, the, mathematical, study, of, continuous, change, which, provided, new, mathematical, methods, for, solving, physical, problems, the, discovery, of, laws, in, thermodynamics, chemistry, and, electromagnetics, resulted, from, research, efforts, during, the, industrial, revolution, as, energy, needs, increased, the, laws, comprising, classical, physics, remain, widely, used, for, objects, on, everyday, scales, travelling, at, non, relativistic, speeds, since, they, provide, a, close, approximation, in, such, situations, and, theories, such, as, quantum, mechanics, and, the, theory, of, relativity, simplify, to, their, classical, equivalents, at, such, scales, inaccuracies, in, classical, mechanics, for, very, small, objects, and, very, high, velocities, led, to, the, development, of, modern, physics, in, the, 20th, century, modern, physics, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, work, of, max, planck, in, quantum, theory, and, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, both, of, these, theories, came, about, due, to, inaccuracies, in, classical, mechanics, in, certain, situations, classical, mechanics, predicted, that, the, speed, of, light, depends, on, the, motion, of, the, observer, which, could, not, be, resolved, with, the, constant, speed, predicted, by, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, this, discrepancy, was, corrected, by, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, which, replaced, classical, mechanics, for, fast, moving, bodies, and, allowed, for, a, constant, speed, of, light, black, body, radiation, provided, another, problem, for, classical, physics, which, was, corrected, when, planck, proposed, that, the, excitation, of, material, oscillators, is, possible, only, in, discrete, steps, proportional, to, their, frequency, this, along, with, the, photoelectric, effect, and, a, complete, theory, predicting, discrete, energy, levels, of, electron, orbitals, led, to, the, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, improving, on, classical, physics, at, very, small, scales, quantum, mechanics, would, come, to, be, pioneered, by, werner, heisenberg, erwin, schr, dinger, and, paul, dirac, from, this, early, work, and, work, in, related, fields, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, was, derived, following, the, discovery, of, a, particle, with, properties, consistent, with, the, higgs, boson, at, cern, in, 2012, all, fundamental, particles, predicted, by, the, standard, model, and, no, others, appear, to, exist, however, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, with, theories, such, as, supersymmetry, is, an, active, area, of, research, areas, of, mathematics, in, general, are, important, to, this, field, such, as, the, study, of, probabilities, and, groups, in, many, ways, physics, stems, from, ancient, greek, philosophy, from, thales, first, attempt, to, characterize, matter, to, democritus, deduction, that, matter, ought, to, reduce, to, an, invariant, state, to, the, ptolemaic, astronomy, of, a, crystalline, firmament, and, aristotle, s, book, physics, an, early, book, on, physics, which, attempted, to, analyze, and, define, motion, from, a, philosophical, point, of, view, various, greek, philosophers, advanced, their, own, theories, of, nature, physics, was, known, as, natural, philosophy, until, the, late, 18th, century, by, the, 19th, century, physics, was, realized, as, a, discipline, distinct, from, philosophy, and, the, other, sciences, physics, as, with, the, rest, of, science, relies, on, philosophy, of, science, and, its, scientific, method, to, advance, knowledge, of, the, physical, world, the, scientific, method, employs, a, priori, reasoning, as, well, as, a, posteriori, reasoning, and, the, use, of, bayesian, inference, to, measure, the, validity, of, a, given, theory, the, development, of, physics, has, answered, many, questions, of, early, philosophers, and, has, raised, new, questions, study, of, the, philosophical, issues, surrounding, physics, the, philosophy, of, physics, involves, issues, such, as, the, nature, of, space, and, time, determinism, and, metaphysical, outlooks, such, as, empiricism, naturalism, and, realism, many, physicists, have, written, about, the, philosophical, implications, of, their, work, for, instance, laplace, who, championed, causal, determinism, and, erwin, schr, dinger, who, wrote, on, quantum, mechanics, the, mathematical, physicist, roger, penrose, has, been, called, a, platonist, by, stephen, hawking, a, view, penrose, discusses, in, his, book, the, road, to, reality, hawking, referred, to, himself, as, an, unashamed, reductionist, and, took, issue, with, penrose, s, views, physics, deals, with, a, wide, variety, of, systems, although, certain, theories, are, used, by, all, physicists, each, of, these, theories, was, experimentally, tested, numerous, times, and, found, to, be, an, adequate, approximation, of, nature, for, instance, the, theory, of, classical, mechanics, accurately, describes, the, motion, of, objects, provided, they, are, much, larger, than, atoms, and, moving, at, a, speed, much, less, than, the, speed, of, light, these, theories, continue, to, be, areas, of, active, research, today, chaos, theory, an, aspect, of, classical, mechanics, was, discovered, in, the, 20th, century, three, centuries, after, the, original, formulation, of, classical, mechanics, by, newton, 1642, 1727, these, central, theories, are, important, tools, for, research, into, more, specialized, topics, and, any, physicist, regardless, of, their, specialization, is, expected, to, be, literate, in, them, these, include, classical, mechanics, quantum, mechanics, thermodynamics, and, statistical, mechanics, electromagnetism, and, special, relativity, classical, physics, includes, the, traditional, branches, and, topics, that, were, recognized, and, well, developed, before, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, classical, mechanics, acoustics, optics, thermodynamics, and, electromagnetism, classical, mechanics, is, concerned, with, bodies, acted, on, by, forces, and, bodies, in, motion, and, may, be, divided, into, statics, study, of, the, forces, on, a, body, or, bodies, not, subject, to, an, acceleration, kinematics, study, of, motion, without, regard, to, its, causes, and, dynamics, study, of, motion, and, the, forces, that, affect, it, mechanics, may, also, be, divided, into, solid, mechanics, and, fluid, mechanics, known, together, as, continuum, mechanics, the, latter, include, such, branches, as, hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, and, pneumatics, acoustics, is, the, study, of, how, sound, is, produced, controlled, transmitted, and, received, important, modern, branches, of, acoustics, include, ultrasonics, the, study, of, sound, waves, of, very, high, frequency, beyond, the, range, of, human, hearing, bioacoustics, the, physics, of, animal, calls, and, hearing, and, electroacoustics, the, manipulation, of, audible, sound, waves, using, electronics, optics, the, study, of, light, is, concerned, not, only, with, visible, light, but, also, with, infrared, and, ultraviolet, radiation, which, exhibit, all, of, the, phenomena, of, visible, light, except, visibility, e, g, reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and, polarization, of, light, heat, is, a, form, of, energy, the, internal, energy, possessed, by, the, particles, of, which, a, substance, is, composed, thermodynamics, deals, with, the, relationships, between, heat, and, other, forms, of, energy, electricity, and, magnetism, have, been, studied, as, a, single, branch, of, physics, since, the, intimate, connection, between, them, was, discovered, in, the, early, 19th, century, an, electric, current, gives, rise, to, a, magnetic, field, and, a, changing, magnetic, field, induces, an, electric, current, electrostatics, deals, with, electric, charges, at, rest, electrodynamics, with, moving, charges, and, magnetostatics, with, magnetic, poles, at, rest, classical, physics, is, generally, concerned, with, matter, and, energy, on, the, normal, scale, of, observation, while, much, of, modern, physics, is, concerned, with, the, behavior, of, matter, and, energy, under, extreme, conditions, or, on, a, very, large, or, very, small, scale, for, example, atomic, and, nuclear, physics, study, matter, on, the, smallest, scale, at, which, chemical, elements, can, be, identified, the, physics, of, elementary, particles, is, on, an, even, smaller, scale, since, it, is, concerned, with, the, most, basic, units, of, matter, this, branch, of, physics, is, also, known, as, high, energy, physics, because, of, the, extremely, high, energies, necessary, to, produce, many, types, of, particles, in, particle, accelerators, on, this, scale, ordinary, commonsensical, notions, of, space, time, matter, and, energy, are, no, longer, valid, the, two, chief, theories, of, modern, physics, present, a, different, picture, of, the, concepts, of, space, time, and, matter, from, that, presented, by, classical, physics, classical, mechanics, approximates, nature, as, continuous, while, quantum, theory, is, concerned, with, the, discrete, nature, of, many, phenomena, at, the, atomic, and, subatomic, level, and, with, the, complementary, aspects, of, particles, and, waves, in, the, description, of, such, phenomena, the, theory, of, relativity, is, concerned, with, the, description, of, phenomena, that, take, place, in, a, frame, of, reference, that, is, in, motion, with, respect, to, an, observer, the, special, theory, of, relativity, is, concerned, with, motion, in, the, absence, of, gravitational, fields, and, the, general, theory, of, relativity, with, motion, and, its, connection, with, gravitation, both, quantum, theory, and, the, theory, of, relativity, find, applications, in, many, areas, of, modern, physics, while, physics, itself, aims, to, discover, universal, laws, its, theories, lie, in, explicit, domains, of, applicability, loosely, speaking, the, laws, of, classical, physics, accurately, describe, systems, whose, important, length, scales, are, greater, than, the, atomic, scale, and, whose, motions, are, much, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, outside, of, this, domain, observations, do, not, match, predictions, provided, by, classical, mechanics, einstein, contributed, the, framework, of, special, relativity, which, replaced, notions, of, absolute, time, and, space, with, spacetime, and, allowed, an, accurate, description, of, systems, whose, components, have, speeds, approaching, the, speed, of, light, planck, schr, dinger, and, others, introduced, quantum, mechanics, a, probabilistic, notion, of, particles, and, interactions, that, allowed, an, accurate, description, of, atomic, and, subatomic, scales, later, quantum, field, theory, unified, quantum, mechanics, and, special, relativity, general, relativity, allowed, for, a, dynamical, curved, spacetime, with, which, highly, massive, systems, and, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, can, be, well, described, general, relativity, has, not, yet, been, unified, with, the, other, fundamental, descriptions, several, candidate, theories, of, quantum, gravity, are, being, developed, mathematics, provides, a, compact, and, exact, language, used, to, describe, the, order, in, nature, this, was, noted, and, advocated, by, pythagoras, plato, galileo, and, newton, some, theorists, like, hilary, putnam, and, penelope, maddy, hold, that, logical, truths, and, therefore, mathematical, reasoning, depend, on, the, empirical, world, this, is, usually, combined, with, the, claim, that, the, laws, of, logic, express, universal, regularities, found, in, the, structural, features, of, the, world, which, may, explain, the, peculiar, relation, between, these, fields, physics, uses, mathematics, to, organise, and, formulate, experimental, results, from, those, results, precise, or, estimated, solutions, are, obtained, or, quantitative, results, from, which, new, predictions, can, be, made, and, experimentally, confirmed, or, negated, the, results, from, physics, experiments, are, numerical, data, with, their, units, of, measure, and, estimates, of, the, errors, in, the, measurements, technologies, based, on, mathematics, like, computation, have, made, computational, physics, an, active, area, of, research, ontology, is, a, prerequisite, for, physics, but, not, for, mathematics, it, means, physics, is, ultimately, concerned, with, descriptions, of, the, real, world, while, mathematics, is, concerned, with, abstract, patterns, even, beyond, the, real, world, thus, physics, statements, are, synthetic, while, mathematical, statements, are, analytic, mathematics, contains, hypotheses, while, physics, contains, theories, mathematics, statements, have, to, be, only, logically, true, while, predictions, of, physics, statements, must, match, observed, and, experimental, data, the, distinction, is, clear, cut, but, not, always, obvious, for, example, mathematical, physics, is, the, application, of, mathematics, in, physics, its, methods, are, mathematical, but, its, subject, is, physical, the, problems, in, this, field, start, with, a, mathematical, model, of, a, physical, situation, system, and, a, mathematical, description, of, a, physical, law, that, will, be, applied, to, that, system, every, mathematical, statement, used, for, solving, has, a, hard, to, find, physical, meaning, the, final, mathematical, solution, has, an, easier, to, find, meaning, because, it, is, what, the, solver, is, looking, for, pure, physics, is, a, branch, of, fundamental, science, also, called, basic, science, physics, is, also, called, the, fundamental, science, because, all, branches, of, natural, science, like, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and, biology, are, constrained, by, laws, of, physics, similarly, chemistry, is, often, called, the, central, science, because, of, its, role, in, linking, the, physical, sciences, for, example, chemistry, studies, properties, structures, and, reactions, of, matter, chemistry, s, focus, on, the, molecular, and, atomic, scale, distinguishes, it, from, physics, structures, are, formed, because, particles, exert, electrical, forces, on, each, other, properties, include, physical, characteristics, of, given, substances, and, reactions, are, bound, by, laws, of, physics, like, conservation, of, energy, mass, and, charge, physics, is, applied, in, industries, like, engineering, and, medicine, applied, physics, is, a, general, term, for, physics, research, which, is, intended, for, a, particular, use, an, applied, physics, curriculum, usually, contains, a, few, classes, in, an, applied, discipline, like, geology, or, electrical, engineering, it, usually, differs, from, engineering, in, that, an, applied, physicist, may, not, be, designing, something, in, particular, but, rather, is, using, physics, or, conducting, physics, research, with, the, aim, of, developing, new, technologies, or, solving, a, problem, the, approach, is, similar, to, that, of, applied, mathematics, applied, physicists, use, physics, in, scientific, research, for, instance, people, working, on, accelerator, physics, might, seek, to, build, better, particle, detectors, for, research, in, theoretical, physics, physics, is, used, heavily, in, engineering, for, example, statics, a, subfield, of, mechanics, is, used, in, the, building, of, bridges, and, other, static, structures, the, understanding, and, use, of, acoustics, results, in, sound, control, and, better, concert, halls, similarly, the, use, of, optics, creates, better, optical, devices, an, understanding, of, physics, makes, for, more, realistic, flight, simulators, video, games, and, movies, and, is, often, critical, in, forensic, investigations, with, the, standard, consensus, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, universal, and, do, not, change, with, time, physics, can, be, used, to, study, things, that, would, ordinarily, be, mired, in, uncertainty, for, example, in, the, study, of, the, origin, of, the, earth, a, physicist, can, reasonably, model, earth, s, mass, temperature, and, rate, of, rotation, as, a, function, of, time, allowing, the, extrapolation, forward, or, backward, in, time, and, so, predict, future, or, prior, events, it, also, allows, for, simulations, in, engineering, that, speed, up, the, development, of, a, new, technology, there, is, also, considerable, interdisciplinarity, so, many, other, important, fields, are, influenced, by, physics, e, g, the, fields, of, econophysics, and, sociophysics, physicists, use, the, scientific, method, to, test, the, validity, of, a, physical, theory, by, using, a, methodical, approach, to, compare, the, implications, of, a, theory, with, the, conclusions, drawn, from, its, related, experiments, and, observations, physicists, are, better, able, to, test, the, validity, of, a, theory, in, a, logical, unbiased, and, repeatable, way, to, that, end, experiments, are, performed, and, observations, are, made, in, order, to, determine, the, validity, or, invalidity, of, a, theory, a, scientific, law, is, a, concise, verbal, or, mathematical, statement, of, a, relation, that, expresses, a, fundamental, principle, of, some, theory, such, as, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, theorists, seek, to, develop, mathematical, models, that, both, agree, with, existing, experiments, and, successfully, predict, future, experimental, results, while, experimentalists, devise, and, perform, experiments, to, test, theoretical, predictions, and, explore, new, phenomena, although, theory, and, experiment, are, developed, separately, they, strongly, affect, and, depend, upon, each, other, progress, in, physics, frequently, comes, about, when, experimental, results, defy, explanation, by, existing, theories, prompting, intense, focus, on, applicable, modelling, and, when, new, theories, generate, experimentally, testable, predictions, which, inspire, the, development, of, new, experiments, and, often, related, equipment, physicists, who, work, at, the, interplay, of, theory, and, experiment, are, called, phenomenologists, who, study, complex, phenomena, observed, in, experiment, and, work, to, relate, them, to, a, fundamental, theory, theoretical, physics, has, historically, taken, inspiration, from, philosophy, electromagnetism, was, unified, this, way, beyond, the, known, universe, the, field, of, theoretical, physics, also, deals, with, hypothetical, issues, such, as, parallel, universes, a, multiverse, and, higher, dimensions, theorists, invoke, these, ideas, in, hopes, of, solving, particular, problems, with, existing, theories, they, then, explore, the, consequences, of, these, ideas, and, work, toward, making, testable, predictions, experimental, physics, expands, and, is, expanded, by, engineering, and, technology, experimental, physicists, who, are, involved, in, basic, research, design, and, perform, experiments, with, equipment, such, as, particle, accelerators, and, lasers, whereas, those, involved, in, applied, research, often, work, in, industry, developing, technologies, such, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, transistors, feynman, has, noted, that, experimentalists, may, seek, areas, that, have, not, been, explored, well, by, theorists, physics, covers, a, wide, range, of, phenomena, from, elementary, particles, such, as, quarks, neutrinos, and, electrons, to, the, largest, superclusters, of, galaxies, included, in, these, phenomena, are, the, most, basic, objects, composing, all, other, things, therefore, physics, is, sometimes, called, the, fundamental, science, physics, aims, to, describe, the, various, phenomena, that, occur, in, nature, in, terms, of, simpler, phenomena, thus, physics, aims, to, both, connect, the, things, observable, to, humans, to, root, causes, and, then, connect, these, causes, together, for, example, the, ancient, chinese, observed, that, certain, rocks, lodestone, and, magnetite, were, attracted, to, one, another, by, an, invisible, force, this, effect, was, later, called, magnetism, which, was, first, rigorously, studied, in, the, 17th, century, but, even, before, the, chinese, discovered, magnetism, the, ancient, greeks, knew, of, other, objects, such, as, amber, that, when, rubbed, with, fur, would, cause, a, similar, invisible, attraction, between, the, two, this, was, also, first, studied, rigorously, in, the, 17th, century, and, came, to, be, called, electricity, thus, physics, had, come, to, understand, two, observations, of, nature, in, terms, of, some, root, cause, electricity, and, magnetism, however, further, work, in, the, 19th, century, revealed, that, these, two, forces, were, just, two, different, aspects, of, one, force, electromagnetism, this, process, of, unifying, forces, continues, today, and, electromagnetism, and, the, weak, nuclear, force, are, now, considered, to, be, two, aspects, of, the, electroweak, interaction, physics, hopes, to, find, an, ultimate, reason, theory, of, everything, for, why, nature, is, as, it, is, see, section, current, research, below, for, more, information, contemporary, research, in, physics, can, be, broadly, divided, into, nuclear, and, particle, physics, condensed, matter, physics, atomic, molecular, and, optical, physics, astrophysics, and, applied, physics, some, physics, departments, also, support, physics, education, research, and, physics, outreach, since, the, 20th, century, the, individual, fields, of, physics, have, become, increasingly, specialised, and, today, most, physicists, work, in, a, single, field, for, their, entire, careers, universalists, such, as, einstein, 1879, 1955, and, lev, landau, 1908, 1968, who, worked, in, multiple, fields, of, physics, are, now, very, rare, the, major, fields, of, physics, along, with, their, subfields, and, the, theories, and, concepts, they, employ, are, shown, in, the, following, table, particle, physics, is, the, study, of, the, elementary, constituents, of, matter, and, energy, and, the, interactions, between, them, in, addition, particle, physicists, design, and, develop, the, high, energy, accelerators, detectors, and, computer, programs, necessary, for, this, research, the, field, is, also, called, high, energy, physics, because, many, elementary, particles, do, not, occur, naturally, but, are, created, only, during, high, energy, collisions, of, other, particles, currently, the, interactions, of, elementary, particles, and, fields, are, described, by, the, standard, model, the, model, accounts, for, the, 12, known, particles, of, matter, quarks, and, leptons, that, interact, via, the, strong, weak, and, electromagnetic, fundamental, forces, dynamics, are, described, in, terms, of, matter, particles, exchanging, gauge, bosons, gluons, w, and, z, bosons, and, photons, respectively, the, standard, model, also, predicts, a, particle, known, as, the, higgs, boson, in, july, 2012, cern, the, european, laboratory, for, particle, physics, announced, the, detection, of, a, particle, consistent, with, the, higgs, boson, an, integral, part, of, the, higgs, mechanism, nuclear, physics, is, the, field, of, physics, that, studies, the, constituents, and, interactions, of, atomic, nuclei, the, most, commonly, known, applications, of, nuclear, physics, are, nuclear, power, generation, and, nuclear, weapons, technology, but, the, research, has, provided, application, in, many, fields, including, those, in, nuclear, medicine, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, ion, implantation, in, materials, engineering, and, radiocarbon, dating, in, geology, and, archaeology, atomic, molecular, and, optical, physics, amo, is, the, study, of, matter, matter, and, light, matter, interactions, on, the, scale, of, single, atoms, and, molecules, the, three, areas, are, grouped, together, because, of, their, interrelationships, the, similarity, of, methods, used, and, the, commonality, of, their, relevant, energy, scales, all, three, areas, include, both, classical, semi, classical, and, quantum, treatments, they, can, treat, their, subject, from, a, microscopic, view, in, contrast, to, a, macroscopic, view, atomic, physics, studies, the, electron, shells, of, atoms, current, research, focuses, on, activities, in, quantum, control, cooling, and, trapping, of, atoms, and, ions, low, temperature, collision, dynamics, and, the, effects, of, electron, correlation, on, structure, and, dynamics, atomic, physics, is, influenced, by, the, nucleus, see, hyperfine, splitting, but, intra, nuclear, phenomena, such, as, fission, and, fusion, are, considered, part, of, nuclear, physics, molecular, physics, focuses, on, multi, atomic, structures, and, their, internal, and, external, interactions, with, matter, and, light, optical, physics, is, distinct, from, optics, in, that, it, tends, to, focus, not, on, the, control, of, classical, light, fields, by, macroscopic, objects, but, on, the, fundamental, properties, of, optical, fields, and, their, interactions, with, matter, in, the, microscopic, realm, condensed, matter, physics, is, the, field, of, physics, that, deals, with, the, macroscopic, physical, properties, of, matter, in, particular, it, is, concerned, with, the, condensed, phases, that, appear, whenever, the, number, of, particles, in, a, system, is, extremely, large, and, the, interactions, between, them, are, strong, the, most, familiar, examples, of, condensed, phases, are, solids, and, liquids, which, arise, from, the, bonding, by, way, of, the, electromagnetic, force, between, atoms, more, exotic, condensed, phases, include, the, superfluid, and, the, bose, einstein, condensate, found, in, certain, atomic, systems, at, very, low, temperature, the, superconducting, phase, exhibited, by, conduction, electrons, in, certain, materials, and, the, ferromagnetic, and, antiferromagnetic, phases, of, spins, on, atomic, lattices, condensed, matter, physics, is, the, largest, field, of, contemporary, physics, historically, condensed, matter, physics, grew, out, of, solid, state, physics, which, is, now, considered, one, of, its, main, subfields, the, term, condensed, matter, physics, was, apparently, coined, by, philip, anderson, when, he, renamed, his, research, group, previously, solid, state, theory, in, 1967, in, 1978, the, division, of, solid, state, physics, of, the, american, physical, society, was, renamed, as, the, division, of, condensed, matter, physics, condensed, matter, physics, has, a, large, overlap, with, chemistry, materials, science, nanotechnology, and, engineering, astrophysics, and, astronomy, are, the, application, of, the, theories, and, methods, of, physics, to, the, study, of, stellar, structure, stellar, evolution, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, and, related, problems, of, cosmology, because, astrophysics, is, a, broad, subject, astrophysicists, typically, apply, many, disciplines, of, physics, including, mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical, mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum, mechanics, relativity, nuclear, and, particle, physics, and, atomic, and, molecular, physics, the, discovery, by, karl, jansky, in, 1931, that, radio, signals, were, emitted, by, celestial, bodies, initiated, the, science, of, radio, astronomy, most, recently, the, frontiers, of, astronomy, have, been, expanded, by, space, exploration, perturbations, and, interference, from, the, earth, s, atmosphere, make, space, based, observations, necessary, for, infrared, ultraviolet, gamma, ray, and, x, ray, astronomy, physical, cosmology, is, the, study, of, the, formation, and, evolution, of, the, universe, on, its, largest, scales, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, plays, a, central, role, in, all, modern, cosmological, theories, in, the, early, 20th, century, hubble, s, discovery, that, the, universe, is, expanding, as, shown, by, the, hubble, diagram, prompted, rival, explanations, known, as, the, steady, state, universe, and, the, big, bang, the, big, bang, was, confirmed, by, the, success, of, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, and, the, discovery, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, in, 1964, the, big, bang, model, rests, on, two, theoretical, pillars, albert, einstein, s, general, relativity, and, the, cosmological, principle, cosmologists, have, recently, established, the, cdm, model, of, the, evolution, of, the, universe, which, includes, cosmic, inflation, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, numerous, possibilities, and, discoveries, are, anticipated, to, emerge, from, new, data, from, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, over, the, upcoming, decade, and, vastly, revise, or, clarify, existing, models, of, the, universe, in, particular, the, potential, for, a, tremendous, discovery, surrounding, dark, matter, is, possible, over, the, next, several, years, fermi, will, search, for, evidence, that, dark, matter, is, composed, of, weakly, interacting, massive, particles, complementing, similar, experiments, with, the, large, hadron, collider, and, other, underground, detectors, ibex, is, already, yielding, new, astrophysical, discoveries, no, one, knows, what, is, creating, the, ena, energetic, neutral, atoms, ribbon, along, the, termination, shock, of, the, solar, wind, but, everyone, agrees, that, it, means, the, textbook, picture, of, the, heliosphere, in, which, the, solar, system, s, enveloping, pocket, filled, with, the, solar, wind, s, charged, particles, is, plowing, through, the, onrushing, galactic, wind, of, the, interstellar, medium, in, the, shape, of, a, comet, is, wrong, research, in, physics, is, continually, progressing, on, a, large, number, of, fronts, in, condensed, matter, physics, an, important, unsolved, theoretical, problem, is, that, of, high, temperature, superconductivity, many, condensed, matter, experiments, are, aiming, to, fabricate, workable, spintronics, and, quantum, computers, in, particle, physics, the, first, pieces, of, experimental, evidence, for, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, have, begun, to, appear, foremost, among, these, are, indications, that, neutrinos, have, non, zero, mass, these, experimental, results, appear, to, have, solved, the, long, standing, solar, neutrino, problem, and, the, physics, of, massive, neutrinos, remains, an, area, of, active, theoretical, and, experimental, research, the, large, hadron, collider, has, already, found, the, higgs, boson, but, future, research, aims, to, prove, or, disprove, the, supersymmetry, which, extends, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, research, on, the, nature, of, the, major, mysteries, of, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, is, also, currently, ongoing, although, much, progress, has, been, made, in, high, energy, quantum, and, astronomical, physics, many, everyday, phenomena, involving, complexity, chaos, or, turbulence, are, still, poorly, understood, complex, problems, that, seem, like, they, could, be, solved, by, a, clever, application, of, dynamics, and, mechanics, remain, unsolved, examples, include, the, formation, of, sandpiles, nodes, in, trickling, water, the, shape, of, water, droplets, mechanisms, of, surface, tension, catastrophes, and, self, sorting, in, shaken, heterogeneous, collections, these, complex, phenomena, have, received, growing, attention, since, the, 1970s, for, several, reasons, including, the, availability, of, modern, mathematical, methods, and, computers, which, enabled, complex, systems, to, be, modeled, in, new, ways, complex, physics, has, become, part, of, increasingly, interdisciplinary, research, as, exemplified, by, the, study, of, turbulence, in, aerodynamics, and, the, observation, of, pattern, formation, in, biological, systems, in, the, 1932, annual, review, of, fluid, mechanics, horace, lamb, said, i, am, an, old, man, now, and, when, i, die, and, go, to, heaven, there, are, two, matters, on, which, i, hope, for, enlightenment, one, is, quantum, electrodynamics, and, the, other, is, the, turbulent, motion, of, fluids, and, about, the, former, i, am, rather, optimistic, a, physicist, is, a, scientist, who, specializes, in, the, field, of, physics, which, encompasses, the, interactions, of, matter, and, energy, at, all, length, and, time, scales, in, the, physical, universe, physicists, generally, are, interested, in, the, root, or, ultimate, causes, of, phenomena, and, usually, frame, their, understanding, in, mathematical, terms, they, work, across, a, wide, range, of, research, fields, spanning, all, length, scales, from, sub, atomic, and, particle, physics, through, biological, physics, to, cosmological, length, scales, encompassing, the, universe, as, a, whole, the, field, generally, includes, two, types, of, physicists, experimental, physicists, who, specialize, in, the, observation, of, natural, phenomena, and, the, development, and, analysis, of, experiments, and, theoretical, physicists, who, specialize, in, mathematical, modeling, of, physical, systems, to, rationalize, explain, and, predict, natural, phenomena
