nucleosynthesis, is, the, process, that, creates, new, atomic, nuclei, from, pre, existing, nucleons, protons, and, neutrons, and, nuclei, according, to, current, theories, the, first, nuclei, were, formed, a, few, minutes, after, the, big, bang, through, nuclear, reactions, in, a, process, called, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, after, about, 20, minutes, the, universe, had, expanded, and, cooled, to, a, point, at, which, these, high, energy, collisions, among, nucleons, ended, so, only, the, fastest, and, simplest, reactions, occurred, leaving, our, universe, containing, hydrogen, and, helium, the, rest, is, traces, of, other, elements, such, as, lithium, and, the, hydrogen, isotope, deuterium, nucleosynthesis, in, stars, and, their, explosions, later, produced, the, variety, of, elements, and, isotopes, that, we, have, today, in, a, process, called, cosmic, chemical, evolution, the, amounts, of, total, mass, in, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, called, metals, by, astrophysicists, remains, small, few, percent, so, that, the, universe, still, has, approximately, the, same, composition, stars, fuse, light, elements, to, heavier, ones, in, their, cores, giving, off, energy, in, the, process, known, as, stellar, nucleosynthesis, nuclear, fusion, reactions, create, many, of, the, lighter, elements, up, to, and, including, iron, and, nickel, in, the, most, massive, stars, products, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, remain, trapped, in, stellar, cores, and, remnants, except, if, ejected, through, stellar, winds, and, explosions, the, neutron, capture, reactions, of, the, r, process, and, s, process, create, heavier, elements, from, iron, upwards, supernova, nucleosynthesis, within, exploding, stars, is, largely, responsible, for, the, elements, between, oxygen, and, rubidium, from, the, ejection, of, elements, produced, during, stellar, nucleosynthesis, through, explosive, nucleosynthesis, during, the, supernova, explosion, and, from, the, r, process, absorption, of, multiple, neutrons, during, the, explosion, neutron, star, mergers, are, a, recently, discovered, major, source, of, elements, produced, in, the, r, process, when, two, neutron, stars, collide, a, significant, amount, of, neutron, rich, matter, may, be, ejected, which, then, quickly, forms, heavy, elements, cosmic, ray, spallation, is, a, process, wherein, cosmic, rays, impact, nuclei, and, fragment, them, it, is, a, significant, source, of, the, lighter, nuclei, particularly, 3, he, 9, be, and, 10, 11, b, that, are, not, created, by, stellar, nucleosynthesis, cosmic, ray, spallation, can, occur, in, the, interstellar, medium, on, asteroids, and, meteoroids, or, on, earth, in, the, atmosphere, or, in, the, ground, this, contributes, to, the, presence, on, earth, of, cosmogenic, nuclides, on, earth, new, nuclei, are, also, produced, by, radiogenesis, the, decay, of, long, lived, primordial, radionuclides, such, as, uranium, thorium, and, potassium, 40, it, is, thought, that, the, primordial, nucleons, themselves, were, formed, from, the, quark, gluon, plasma, around, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, during, the, big, bang, as, it, cooled, below, two, trillion, degrees, a, few, minutes, afterwards, starting, with, only, protons, and, neutrons, nuclei, up, to, lithium, and, beryllium, both, with, mass, number, 7, were, formed, but, hardly, any, other, elements, some, boron, may, have, been, formed, at, this, time, but, the, process, stopped, before, significant, carbon, could, be, formed, as, this, element, requires, a, far, higher, product, of, helium, density, and, time, than, were, present, in, the, short, nucleosynthesis, period, of, the, big, bang, that, fusion, process, essentially, shut, down, at, about, 20, minutes, due, to, drops, in, temperature, and, density, as, the, universe, continued, to, expand, this, first, process, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, was, the, first, type, of, nucleogenesis, to, occur, in, the, universe, creating, the, so, called, primordial, elements, a, star, formed, in, the, early, universe, produces, heavier, elements, by, combining, its, lighter, nuclei, hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, which, were, found, in, the, initial, composition, of, the, interstellar, medium, and, hence, the, star, interstellar, gas, therefore, contains, declining, abundances, of, these, light, elements, which, are, present, only, by, virtue, of, their, nucleosynthesis, during, the, big, bang, and, also, cosmic, ray, spallation, these, lighter, elements, in, the, present, universe, are, therefore, thought, to, have, been, produced, through, thousands, of, millions, of, years, of, cosmic, ray, mostly, high, energy, proton, mediated, breakup, of, heavier, elements, in, interstellar, gas, and, dust, the, fragments, of, these, cosmic, ray, collisions, include, helium, 3, and, the, stable, isotopes, of, the, light, elements, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, carbon, was, not, made, in, the, big, bang, but, was, produced, later, in, larger, stars, via, the, triple, alpha, process, the, subsequent, nucleosynthesis, of, heavier, elements, z, 6, carbon, and, heavier, elements, requires, the, extreme, temperatures, and, pressures, found, within, stars, and, supernovae, these, processes, began, as, hydrogen, and, helium, from, the, big, bang, collapsed, into, the, first, stars, after, about, 500, million, years, star, formation, has, been, occurring, continuously, in, galaxies, since, that, time, the, primordial, nuclides, were, created, by, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, stellar, nucleosynthesis, supernova, nucleosynthesis, and, by, nucleosynthesis, in, exotic, events, such, as, neutron, star, collisions, other, nuclides, such, as, 40, ar, formed, later, through, radioactive, decay, on, earth, mixing, and, evaporation, has, altered, the, primordial, composition, to, what, is, called, the, natural, terrestrial, composition, the, heavier, elements, produced, after, the, big, bang, range, in, atomic, numbers, from, z, 6, carbon, to, z, 94, plutonium, synthesis, of, these, elements, occurred, through, nuclear, reactions, involving, the, strong, and, weak, interactions, among, nuclei, and, called, nuclear, fusion, including, both, rapid, and, slow, multiple, neutron, capture, and, include, also, nuclear, fission, and, radioactive, decays, such, as, beta, decay, the, stability, of, atomic, nuclei, of, different, sizes, and, composition, i, e, numbers, of, neutrons, and, protons, plays, an, important, role, in, the, possible, reactions, among, nuclei, cosmic, nucleosynthesis, therefore, is, studied, among, researchers, of, astrophysics, and, nuclear, physics, nuclear, astrophysics, the, first, ideas, on, nucleosynthesis, were, simply, that, the, chemical, elements, were, created, at, the, beginning, of, the, universe, but, no, rational, physical, scenario, for, this, could, be, identified, gradually, it, became, clear, that, hydrogen, and, helium, are, much, more, abundant, than, any, of, the, other, elements, all, the, rest, constitute, less, than, 2, of, the, mass, of, the, solar, system, and, of, other, star, systems, as, well, at, the, same, time, it, was, clear, that, oxygen, and, carbon, were, the, next, two, most, common, elements, and, also, that, there, was, a, general, trend, toward, high, abundance, of, the, light, elements, especially, those, with, isotopes, composed, of, whole, numbers, of, helium, 4, nuclei, alpha, nuclides, arthur, stanley, eddington, first, suggested, in, 1920, that, stars, obtain, their, energy, by, fusing, hydrogen, into, helium, and, raised, the, possibility, that, the, heavier, elements, may, also, form, in, stars, this, idea, was, not, generally, accepted, as, the, nuclear, mechanism, was, not, understood, in, the, years, immediately, before, world, war, ii, hans, bethe, first, elucidated, those, nuclear, mechanisms, by, which, hydrogen, is, fused, into, helium, fred, hoyle, s, original, work, on, nucleosynthesis, of, heavier, elements, in, stars, occurred, just, after, world, war, ii, his, work, explained, the, production, of, all, heavier, elements, starting, from, hydrogen, hoyle, proposed, that, hydrogen, is, continuously, created, in, the, universe, from, vacuum, and, energy, without, need, for, universal, beginning, hoyle, s, work, explained, how, the, abundances, of, the, elements, increased, with, time, as, the, galaxy, aged, subsequently, hoyle, s, picture, was, expanded, during, the, 1960s, by, contributions, from, william, a, fowler, alastair, g, w, cameron, and, donald, d, clayton, followed, by, many, others, the, seminal, 1957, review, paper, by, e, m, burbidge, g, r, burbidge, fowler, and, hoyle, is, a, well, known, summary, of, the, state, of, the, field, in, 1957, that, paper, defined, new, processes, for, the, transformation, of, one, heavy, nucleus, into, others, within, stars, processes, that, could, be, documented, by, astronomers, the, big, bang, itself, had, been, proposed, in, 1931, long, before, this, period, by, georges, lema, tre, a, belgian, physicist, who, suggested, that, the, evident, expansion, of, the, universe, in, time, required, that, the, universe, if, contracted, backwards, in, time, would, continue, to, do, so, until, it, could, contract, no, further, this, would, bring, all, the, mass, of, the, universe, to, a, single, point, a, primeval, atom, to, a, state, before, which, time, and, space, did, not, exist, hoyle, is, credited, with, coining, the, term, big, bang, during, a, 1949, bbc, radio, broadcast, saying, that, lema, tre, s, theory, was, based, on, the, hypothesis, that, all, the, matter, in, the, universe, was, created, in, one, big, bang, at, a, particular, time, in, the, remote, past, it, is, popularly, reported, that, hoyle, intended, this, to, be, pejorative, but, hoyle, explicitly, denied, this, and, said, it, was, just, a, striking, image, meant, to, highlight, the, difference, between, the, two, models, lema, tre, s, model, was, needed, to, explain, the, existence, of, deuterium, and, nuclides, between, helium, and, carbon, as, well, as, the, fundamentally, high, amount, of, helium, present, not, only, in, stars, but, also, in, interstellar, space, as, it, happened, both, lema, tre, and, hoyle, s, models, of, nucleosynthesis, would, be, needed, to, explain, the, elemental, abundances, in, the, universe, the, goal, of, the, theory, of, nucleosynthesis, is, to, explain, the, vastly, differing, abundances, of, the, chemical, elements, and, their, several, isotopes, from, the, perspective, of, natural, processes, the, primary, stimulus, to, the, development, of, this, theory, was, the, shape, of, a, plot, of, the, abundances, versus, the, atomic, number, of, the, elements, those, abundances, when, plotted, on, a, graph, as, a, function, of, atomic, number, have, a, jagged, sawtooth, structure, that, varies, by, factors, up, to, ten, million, a, very, influential, stimulus, to, nucleosynthesis, research, was, an, abundance, table, created, by, hans, suess, and, harold, urey, that, was, based, on, the, unfractionated, abundances, of, the, non, volatile, elements, found, within, unevolved, meteorites, such, a, graph, of, the, abundances, is, displayed, on, a, logarithmic, scale, below, where, the, dramatically, jagged, structure, is, visually, suppressed, by, the, many, powers, of, ten, spanned, in, the, vertical, scale, of, this, graph, there, are, a, number, of, astrophysical, processes, which, are, believed, to, be, responsible, for, nucleosynthesis, the, majority, of, these, occur, within, stars, and, the, chain, of, those, nuclear, fusion, processes, are, known, as, hydrogen, burning, via, the, proton, proton, chain, or, the, cno, cycle, helium, burning, carbon, burning, neon, burning, oxygen, burning, and, silicon, burning, these, processes, are, able, to, create, elements, up, to, and, including, iron, and, nickel, this, is, the, region, of, nucleosynthesis, within, which, the, isotopes, with, the, highest, binding, energy, per, nucleon, are, created, heavier, elements, can, be, assembled, within, stars, by, a, neutron, capture, process, known, as, the, s, process, or, in, explosive, environments, such, as, supernovae, and, neutron, star, mergers, by, a, number, of, other, processes, some, of, those, others, include, the, r, process, which, involves, rapid, neutron, captures, the, rp, process, and, the, p, process, sometimes, known, as, the, gamma, process, which, results, in, the, photodisintegration, of, existing, nuclei, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, occurred, within, the, first, three, minutes, of, the, beginning, of, the, universe, and, is, responsible, for, much, of, the, abundance, of, 1, h, protium, 2, h, d, deuterium, 3, he, helium, 3, and, 4, he, helium, 4, although, 4, he, continues, to, be, produced, by, stellar, fusion, and, alpha, decays, and, trace, amounts, of, 1, h, continue, to, be, produced, by, spallation, and, certain, types, of, radioactive, decay, most, of, the, mass, of, the, isotopes, in, the, universe, are, thought, to, have, been, produced, in, the, big, bang, the, nuclei, of, these, elements, along, with, some, 7, li, and, 7, be, are, considered, to, have, been, formed, between, 100, and, 300, seconds, after, the, big, bang, when, the, primordial, quark, gluon, plasma, froze, out, to, form, protons, and, neutrons, because, of, the, very, short, period, in, which, nucleosynthesis, occurred, before, it, was, stopped, by, expansion, and, cooling, about, 20, minutes, no, elements, heavier, than, beryllium, or, possibly, boron, could, be, formed, elements, formed, during, this, time, were, in, the, plasma, state, and, did, not, cool, to, the, state, of, neutral, atoms, until, much, later, stellar, nucleosynthesis, is, the, nuclear, process, by, which, new, nuclei, are, produced, it, occurs, in, stars, during, stellar, evolution, it, is, responsible, for, the, galactic, abundances, of, elements, from, carbon, to, iron, stars, are, thermonuclear, furnaces, in, which, h, and, he, are, fused, into, heavier, nuclei, by, increasingly, high, temperatures, as, the, composition, of, the, core, evolves, of, particular, importance, is, carbon, because, its, formation, from, he, is, a, bottleneck, in, the, entire, process, carbon, is, produced, by, the, triple, alpha, process, in, all, stars, carbon, is, also, the, main, element, that, causes, the, release, of, free, neutrons, within, stars, giving, rise, to, the, s, process, in, which, the, slow, absorption, of, neutrons, converts, iron, into, elements, heavier, than, iron, and, nickel, the, products, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, are, generally, dispersed, into, the, interstellar, gas, through, mass, loss, episodes, and, the, stellar, winds, of, low, mass, stars, the, mass, loss, events, can, be, witnessed, today, in, the, planetary, nebulae, phase, of, low, mass, star, evolution, and, the, explosive, ending, of, stars, called, supernovae, of, those, with, more, than, eight, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, the, first, direct, proof, that, nucleosynthesis, occurs, in, stars, was, the, astronomical, observation, that, interstellar, gas, has, become, enriched, with, heavy, elements, as, time, passed, as, a, result, stars, that, were, born, from, it, late, in, the, galaxy, formed, with, much, higher, initial, heavy, element, abundances, than, those, that, had, formed, earlier, the, detection, of, technetium, in, the, atmosphere, of, a, red, giant, star, in, 1952, by, spectroscopy, provided, the, first, evidence, of, nuclear, activity, within, stars, because, technetium, is, radioactive, with, a, half, life, much, less, than, the, age, of, the, star, its, abundance, must, reflect, its, recent, creation, within, that, star, equally, convincing, evidence, of, the, stellar, origin, of, heavy, elements, is, the, large, overabundances, of, specific, stable, elements, found, in, stellar, atmospheres, of, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, observation, of, barium, abundances, some, 20, 50, times, greater, than, found, in, unevolved, stars, is, evidence, of, the, operation, of, the, s, process, within, such, stars, many, modern, proofs, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, are, provided, by, the, isotopic, compositions, of, stardust, solid, grains, that, have, condensed, from, the, gases, of, individual, stars, and, which, have, been, extracted, from, meteorites, stardust, is, one, component, of, cosmic, dust, and, is, frequently, called, presolar, grains, the, measured, isotopic, compositions, in, stardust, grains, demonstrate, many, aspects, of, nucleosynthesis, within, the, stars, from, which, the, grains, condensed, during, the, star, s, late, life, mass, loss, episodes, supernova, nucleosynthesis, occurs, in, the, energetic, environment, in, supernovae, in, which, the, elements, between, silicon, and, nickel, are, synthesized, in, quasiequilibrium, established, during, fast, fusion, that, attaches, by, reciprocating, balanced, nuclear, reactions, to, 28, si, quasiequilibrium, can, be, thought, of, as, almost, equilibrium, except, for, a, high, abundance, of, the, 28, si, nuclei, in, the, feverishly, burning, mix, this, concept, was, the, most, important, discovery, in, nucleosynthesis, theory, of, the, intermediate, mass, elements, since, hoyle, s, 1954, paper, because, it, provided, an, overarching, understanding, of, the, abundant, and, chemically, important, elements, between, silicon, a, 28, and, nickel, a, 60, it, replaced, the, incorrect, although, much, cited, alpha, process, of, the, b, 2, fh, paper, which, inadvertently, obscured, hoyle, s, 1954, theory, further, nucleosynthesis, processes, can, occur, in, particular, the, r, process, rapid, process, described, by, the, b, 2, fh, paper, and, first, calculated, by, seeger, fowler, and, clayton, in, which, the, most, neutron, rich, isotopes, of, elements, heavier, than, nickel, are, produced, by, rapid, absorption, of, free, neutrons, the, creation, of, free, neutrons, by, electron, capture, during, the, rapid, compression, of, the, supernova, core, along, with, the, assembly, of, some, neutron, rich, seed, nuclei, makes, the, r, process, a, primary, process, and, one, that, can, occur, even, in, a, star, of, pure, h, and, he, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, b, 2, fh, designation, of, the, process, as, a, secondary, process, this, promising, scenario, though, generally, supported, by, supernova, experts, has, yet, to, achieve, a, satisfactory, calculation, of, r, process, abundances, the, primary, r, process, has, been, confirmed, by, astronomers, who, had, observed, old, stars, born, when, galactic, metallicity, was, still, small, that, nonetheless, contain, their, complement, of, r, process, nuclei, thereby, demonstrating, that, the, metallicity, is, a, product, of, an, internal, process, the, r, process, is, responsible, for, our, natural, cohort, of, radioactive, elements, such, as, uranium, and, thorium, as, well, as, the, most, neutron, rich, isotopes, of, each, heavy, element, the, rp, process, rapid, proton, involves, the, rapid, absorption, of, free, protons, as, well, as, neutrons, but, its, role, and, its, existence, are, less, certain, explosive, nucleosynthesis, occurs, too, rapidly, for, radioactive, decay, to, decrease, the, number, of, neutrons, so, that, many, abundant, isotopes, with, equal, and, even, numbers, of, protons, and, neutrons, are, synthesized, by, the, silicon, quasi, equilibrium, process, during, this, process, the, burning, of, oxygen, and, silicon, fuses, nuclei, that, themselves, have, equal, numbers, of, protons, and, neutrons, to, produce, nuclides, which, consist, of, whole, numbers, of, helium, nuclei, up, to, 15, representing, 60, ni, such, multiple, alpha, particle, nuclides, are, totally, stable, up, to, 40, ca, made, of, 10, helium, nuclei, but, heavier, nuclei, with, equal, and, even, numbers, of, protons, and, neutrons, are, tightly, bound, but, unstable, the, quasi, equilibrium, produces, radioactive, isobars, 44, ti, 48, cr, 52, fe, and, 56, ni, which, except, 44, ti, are, created, in, abundance, but, decay, after, the, explosion, and, leave, the, most, stable, isotope, of, the, corresponding, element, at, the, same, atomic, weight, the, most, abundant, and, extant, isotopes, of, elements, produced, in, this, way, are, 48, ti, 52, cr, and, 56, fe, these, decays, are, accompanied, by, the, emission, of, gamma, rays, radiation, from, the, nucleus, whose, spectroscopic, lines, can, be, used, to, identify, the, isotope, created, by, the, decay, the, detection, of, these, emission, lines, were, an, important, early, product, of, gamma, ray, astronomy, the, most, convincing, proof, of, explosive, nucleosynthesis, in, supernovae, occurred, in, 1987, when, those, gamma, ray, lines, were, detected, emerging, from, supernova, 1987a, gamma, ray, lines, identifying, 56, co, and, 57, co, nuclei, whose, half, lives, limit, their, age, to, about, a, year, proved, that, their, radioactive, cobalt, parents, created, them, this, nuclear, astronomy, observation, was, predicted, in, 1969, as, a, way, to, confirm, explosive, nucleosynthesis, of, the, elements, and, that, prediction, played, an, important, role, in, the, planning, for, nasa, s, compton, gamma, ray, observatory, other, proofs, of, explosive, nucleosynthesis, are, found, within, the, stardust, grains, that, condensed, within, the, interiors, of, supernovae, as, they, expanded, and, cooled, stardust, grains, are, one, component, of, cosmic, dust, in, particular, radioactive, 44, ti, was, measured, to, be, very, abundant, within, supernova, stardust, grains, at, the, time, they, condensed, during, the, supernova, expansion, this, confirmed, a, 1975, prediction, of, the, identification, of, supernova, stardust, sunocons, which, became, part, of, the, pantheon, of, presolar, grains, other, unusual, isotopic, ratios, within, these, grains, reveal, many, specific, aspects, of, explosive, nucleosynthesis, the, merger, of, binary, neutron, stars, bnss, is, now, believed, to, be, the, main, source, of, r, process, elements, being, neutron, rich, by, definition, mergers, of, this, type, had, been, suspected, of, being, a, source, of, such, elements, but, definitive, evidence, was, difficult, to, obtain, in, 2017, strong, evidence, emerged, when, ligo, virgo, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, and, integral, along, with, a, collaboration, of, many, observatories, around, the, world, detected, both, gravitational, wave, and, electromagnetic, signatures, of, a, likely, neutron, star, merger, gw170817, and, subsequently, detected, signals, of, numerous, heavy, elements, such, as, gold, as, the, ejected, degenerate, matter, decays, and, cools, the, first, detection, of, the, merger, of, a, neutron, star, and, black, hole, nsbhs, came, in, july, 2021, and, more, after, but, analysis, seem, to, favor, bnss, over, nsbhs, as, the, main, contributors, to, heavy, metal, production, nucleosynthesis, may, happen, in, accretion, disks, of, black, holes, cosmic, ray, spallation, process, reduces, the, atomic, weight, of, interstellar, matter, by, the, impact, with, cosmic, rays, to, produce, some, of, the, lightest, elements, present, in, the, universe, though, not, a, significant, amount, of, deuterium, most, notably, spallation, is, believed, to, be, responsible, for, the, generation, of, almost, all, of, 3, he, and, the, elements, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, although, some, 7, li, and, 7, be, are, thought, to, have, been, produced, in, the, big, bang, the, spallation, process, results, from, the, impact, of, cosmic, rays, mostly, fast, protons, against, the, interstellar, medium, these, impacts, fragment, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, nuclei, present, the, process, results, in, the, light, elements, beryllium, boron, and, lithium, in, the, cosmos, at, much, greater, abundances, than, they, are, found, within, solar, atmospheres, the, quantities, of, the, light, elements, 1, h, and, 4, he, produced, by, spallation, are, negligible, relative, to, their, primordial, abundance, beryllium, and, boron, are, not, significantly, produced, by, stellar, fusion, processes, since, 8, be, has, an, extremely, short, half, life, of, 8, 2, 10, 17, seconds, theories, of, nucleosynthesis, are, tested, by, calculating, isotope, abundances, and, comparing, those, results, with, observed, abundances, isotope, abundances, are, typically, calculated, from, the, transition, rates, between, isotopes, in, a, network, often, these, calculations, can, be, simplified, as, a, few, key, reactions, control, the, rate, of, other, reactions, tiny, amounts, of, certain, nuclides, are, produced, on, earth, by, artificial, means, those, are, our, primary, source, for, example, of, technetium, however, some, nuclides, are, also, produced, by, a, number, of, natural, means, that, have, continued, after, primordial, elements, were, in, place, these, often, act, to, create, new, elements, in, ways, that, can, be, used, to, date, rocks, or, to, trace, the, source, of, geological, processes, although, these, processes, do, not, produce, the, nuclides, in, abundance, they, are, assumed, to, be, the, entire, source, of, the, existing, natural, supply, of, those, nuclides, these, mechanisms, include
