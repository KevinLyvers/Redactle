scientific, laws, or, laws, of, science, are, statements, based, on, repeated, experiments, or, observations, that, describe, or, predict, a, range, of, natural, phenomena, the, term, law, has, diverse, usage, in, many, cases, approximate, accurate, broad, or, narrow, across, all, fields, of, natural, science, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, laws, are, developed, from, data, and, can, be, further, developed, through, mathematics, in, all, cases, they, are, directly, or, indirectly, based, on, empirical, evidence, it, is, generally, understood, that, they, implicitly, reflect, though, they, do, not, explicitly, assert, causal, relationships, fundamental, to, reality, and, are, discovered, rather, than, invented, scientific, laws, summarize, the, results, of, experiments, or, observations, usually, within, a, certain, range, of, application, in, general, the, accuracy, of, a, law, does, not, change, when, a, new, theory, of, the, relevant, phenomenon, is, worked, out, but, rather, the, scope, of, the, law, s, application, since, the, mathematics, or, statement, representing, the, law, does, not, change, as, with, other, kinds, of, scientific, knowledge, scientific, laws, do, not, express, absolute, certainty, as, mathematical, laws, do, a, scientific, law, may, be, contradicted, restricted, or, extended, by, future, observations, a, law, can, often, be, formulated, as, one, or, several, statements, or, equations, so, that, it, can, predict, the, outcome, of, an, experiment, laws, differ, from, hypotheses, and, postulates, which, are, proposed, during, the, scientific, process, before, and, during, validation, by, experiment, and, observation, hypotheses, and, postulates, are, not, laws, since, they, have, not, been, verified, to, the, same, degree, although, they, may, lead, to, the, formulation, of, laws, laws, are, narrower, in, scope, than, scientific, theories, which, may, entail, one, or, several, laws, science, distinguishes, a, law, or, theory, from, facts, calling, a, law, a, fact, is, ambiguous, an, overstatement, or, an, equivocation, the, nature, of, scientific, laws, has, been, much, discussed, in, philosophy, but, in, essence, scientific, laws, are, simply, empirical, conclusions, reached, by, scientific, method, they, are, intended, to, be, neither, laden, with, ontological, commitments, nor, statements, of, logical, absolutes, a, scientific, law, always, applies, to, a, physical, system, under, repeated, conditions, and, it, implies, that, there, is, a, causal, relationship, involving, the, elements, of, the, system, factual, and, well, confirmed, statements, like, mercury, is, liquid, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, are, considered, too, specific, to, qualify, as, scientific, laws, a, central, problem, in, the, philosophy, of, science, going, back, to, david, hume, is, that, of, distinguishing, causal, relationships, such, as, those, implied, by, laws, from, principles, that, arise, due, to, constant, conjunction, laws, differ, from, scientific, theories, in, that, they, do, not, posit, a, mechanism, or, explanation, of, phenomena, they, are, merely, distillations, of, the, results, of, repeated, observation, as, such, the, applicability, of, a, law, is, limited, to, circumstances, resembling, those, already, observed, and, the, law, may, be, found, to, be, false, when, extrapolated, ohm, s, law, only, applies, to, linear, networks, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, only, applies, in, weak, gravitational, fields, the, early, laws, of, aerodynamics, such, as, bernoulli, s, principle, do, not, apply, in, the, case, of, compressible, flow, such, as, occurs, in, transonic, and, supersonic, flight, hooke, s, law, only, applies, to, strain, below, the, elastic, limit, boyle, s, law, applies, with, perfect, accuracy, only, to, the, ideal, gas, etc, these, laws, remain, useful, but, only, under, the, specified, conditions, where, they, apply, many, laws, take, mathematical, forms, and, thus, can, be, stated, as, an, equation, for, example, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, can, be, written, as, e, 0, displaystyle, delta, e, 0, where, e, displaystyle, e, is, the, total, amount, of, energy, in, the, universe, similarly, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, can, be, written, as, d, u, q, w, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, delta, q, delta, w, and, newton, s, second, law, can, be, written, as, f, d, p, d, t, displaystyle, textstyle, f, frac, dp, dt, while, these, scientific, laws, explain, what, our, senses, perceive, they, are, still, empirical, acquired, by, observation, or, scientific, experiment, and, so, are, not, like, mathematical, theorems, which, can, be, proved, purely, by, mathematics, like, theories, and, hypotheses, laws, make, predictions, specifically, they, predict, that, new, observations, will, conform, to, the, given, law, laws, can, be, falsified, if, they, are, found, in, contradiction, with, new, data, some, laws, are, only, approximations, of, other, more, general, laws, and, are, good, approximations, with, a, restricted, domain, of, applicability, for, example, newtonian, dynamics, which, is, based, on, galilean, transformations, is, the, low, speed, limit, of, special, relativity, since, the, galilean, transformation, is, the, low, speed, approximation, to, the, lorentz, transformation, similarly, the, newtonian, gravitation, law, is, a, low, mass, approximation, of, general, relativity, and, coulomb, s, law, is, an, approximation, to, quantum, electrodynamics, at, large, distances, compared, to, the, range, of, weak, interactions, in, such, cases, it, is, common, to, use, the, simpler, approximate, versions, of, the, laws, instead, of, the, more, accurate, general, laws, laws, are, constantly, being, tested, experimentally, to, increasing, degrees, of, precision, which, is, one, of, the, main, goals, of, science, the, fact, that, laws, have, never, been, observed, to, be, violated, does, not, preclude, testing, them, at, increased, accuracy, or, in, new, kinds, of, conditions, to, confirm, whether, they, continue, to, hold, or, whether, they, break, and, what, can, be, discovered, in, the, process, it, is, always, possible, for, laws, to, be, invalidated, or, proven, to, have, limitations, by, repeatable, experimental, evidence, should, any, be, observed, well, established, laws, have, indeed, been, invalidated, in, some, special, cases, but, the, new, formulations, created, to, explain, the, discrepancies, generalize, upon, rather, than, overthrow, the, originals, that, is, the, invalidated, laws, have, been, found, to, be, only, close, approximations, to, which, other, terms, or, factors, must, be, added, to, cover, previously, unaccounted, for, conditions, e, g, very, large, or, very, small, scales, of, time, or, space, enormous, speeds, or, masses, etc, thus, rather, than, unchanging, knowledge, physical, laws, are, better, viewed, as, a, series, of, improving, and, more, precise, generalizations, scientific, laws, are, typically, conclusions, based, on, repeated, scientific, experiments, and, observations, over, many, years, and, which, have, become, accepted, universally, within, the, scientific, community, a, scientific, law, is, inferred, from, particular, facts, applicable, to, a, defined, group, or, class, of, phenomena, and, expressible, by, the, statement, that, a, particular, phenomenon, always, occurs, if, certain, conditions, be, present, the, production, of, a, summary, description, of, our, environment, in, the, form, of, such, laws, is, a, fundamental, aim, of, science, several, general, properties, of, scientific, laws, particularly, when, referring, to, laws, in, physics, have, been, identified, scientific, laws, are, the, term, scientific, law, is, traditionally, associated, with, the, natural, sciences, though, the, social, sciences, also, contain, laws, for, example, zipf, s, law, is, a, law, in, the, social, sciences, which, is, based, on, mathematical, statistics, in, these, cases, laws, may, describe, general, trends, or, expected, behaviors, rather, than, being, absolutes, in, natural, science, impossibility, assertions, come, to, be, widely, accepted, as, overwhelmingly, probable, rather, than, considered, proved, to, the, point, of, being, unchallengeable, the, basis, for, this, strong, acceptance, is, a, combination, of, extensive, evidence, of, something, not, occurring, combined, with, an, underlying, theory, very, successful, in, making, predictions, whose, assumptions, lead, logically, to, the, conclusion, that, something, is, impossible, while, an, impossibility, assertion, in, natural, science, can, never, be, absolutely, proved, it, could, be, refuted, by, the, observation, of, a, single, counterexample, such, a, counterexample, would, require, that, the, assumptions, underlying, the, theory, that, implied, the, impossibility, be, re, examined, some, examples, of, widely, accepted, impossibilities, in, physics, are, perpetual, motion, machines, which, violate, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, exceeding, the, speed, of, light, which, violates, the, implications, of, special, relativity, the, uncertainty, principle, of, quantum, mechanics, which, asserts, the, impossibility, of, simultaneously, knowing, both, the, position, and, the, momentum, of, a, particle, and, bell, s, theorem, no, physical, theory, of, local, hidden, variables, can, ever, reproduce, all, of, the, predictions, of, quantum, mechanics, some, laws, reflect, mathematical, symmetries, found, in, nature, e, g, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, reflects, identity, of, electrons, conservation, laws, reflect, homogeneity, of, space, time, and, lorentz, transformations, reflect, rotational, symmetry, of, spacetime, many, fundamental, physical, laws, are, mathematical, consequences, of, various, symmetries, of, space, time, or, other, aspects, of, nature, specifically, noether, s, theorem, connects, some, conservation, laws, to, certain, symmetries, for, example, conservation, of, energy, is, a, consequence, of, the, shift, symmetry, of, time, no, moment, of, time, is, different, from, any, other, while, conservation, of, momentum, is, a, consequence, of, the, symmetry, homogeneity, of, space, no, place, in, space, is, special, or, different, from, any, other, the, indistinguishability, of, all, particles, of, each, fundamental, type, say, electrons, or, photons, results, in, the, dirac, and, bose, quantum, statistics, which, in, turn, result, in, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, for, fermions, and, in, bose, einstein, condensation, for, bosons, special, relativity, uses, rapidity, to, express, motion, according, to, the, symmetries, of, hyperbolic, rotation, a, transformation, mixing, space, and, time, symmetry, between, inertial, and, gravitational, mass, results, in, general, relativity, the, inverse, square, law, of, interactions, mediated, by, massless, bosons, is, the, mathematical, consequence, of, the, 3, dimensionality, of, space, one, strategy, in, the, search, for, the, most, fundamental, laws, of, nature, is, to, search, for, the, most, general, mathematical, symmetry, group, that, can, be, applied, to, the, fundamental, interactions, conservation, laws, are, fundamental, laws, that, follow, from, the, homogeneity, of, space, time, and, phase, in, other, words, symmetry, conservation, laws, can, be, expressed, using, the, general, continuity, equation, for, a, conserved, quantity, can, be, written, in, differential, form, as, where, is, some, quantity, per, unit, volume, j, is, the, flux, of, that, quantity, change, in, quantity, per, unit, time, per, unit, area, intuitively, the, divergence, denoted, of, a, vector, field, is, a, measure, of, flux, diverging, radially, outwards, from, a, point, so, the, negative, is, the, amount, piling, up, at, a, point, hence, the, rate, of, change, of, density, in, a, region, of, space, must, be, the, amount, of, flux, leaving, or, collecting, in, some, region, see, the, main, article, for, details, in, the, table, below, the, fluxes, flows, for, various, physical, quantities, in, transport, and, their, associated, continuity, equations, are, collected, for, comparison, u, velocity, field, of, fluid, m, s, 1, wavefunction, of, quantum, system, more, general, equations, are, the, convection, diffusion, equation, and, boltzmann, transport, equation, which, have, their, roots, in, the, continuity, equation, classical, mechanics, including, newton, s, laws, lagrange, s, equations, hamilton, s, equations, etc, can, be, derived, from, the, following, principle, where, s, displaystyle, mathcal, s, is, the, action, the, integral, of, the, lagrangian, of, the, physical, system, between, two, times, t, 1, and, t, 2, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, system, is, t, a, function, of, the, rate, of, change, of, the, configuration, of, the, system, and, potential, energy, is, v, a, function, of, the, configuration, and, its, rate, of, change, the, configuration, of, a, system, which, has, n, degrees, of, freedom, is, defined, by, generalized, coordinates, q, q, 1, q, 2, q, n, there, are, generalized, momenta, conjugate, to, these, coordinates, p, p, 1, p, 2, p, n, where, the, action, and, lagrangian, both, contain, the, dynamics, of, the, system, for, all, times, the, term, path, simply, refers, to, a, curve, traced, out, by, the, system, in, terms, of, the, generalized, coordinates, in, the, configuration, space, i, e, the, curve, q, t, parameterized, by, time, see, also, parametric, equation, for, this, concept, the, action, is, a, functional, rather, than, a, function, since, it, depends, on, the, lagrangian, and, the, lagrangian, depends, on, the, path, q, t, so, the, action, depends, on, the, entire, shape, of, the, path, for, all, times, in, the, time, interval, from, t, 1, to, t, 2, between, two, instants, of, time, there, are, infinitely, many, paths, but, one, for, which, the, action, is, stationary, to, the, first, order, is, the, true, path, the, stationary, value, for, the, entire, continuum, of, lagrangian, values, corresponding, to, some, path, not, just, one, value, of, the, lagrangian, is, required, in, other, words, it, is, not, as, simple, as, differentiating, a, function, and, setting, it, to, zero, then, solving, the, equations, to, find, the, points, of, maxima, and, minima, etc, rather, this, idea, is, applied, to, the, entire, shape, of, the, function, see, calculus, of, variations, for, more, details, on, this, procedure, notice, l, is, not, the, total, energy, e, of, the, system, due, to, the, difference, rather, than, the, sum, the, following, general, approaches, to, classical, mechanics, are, summarized, below, in, the, order, of, establishment, they, are, equivalent, formulations, newton, s, is, commonly, used, due, to, simplicity, but, hamilton, s, and, lagrange, s, equations, are, more, general, and, their, range, can, extend, into, other, branches, of, physics, with, suitable, modifications, s, t, 1, t, 2, l, d, t, displaystyle, mathcal, s, int, t, 1, t, 2, l, mathrm, d, t, using, the, definition, of, generalized, momentum, there, is, the, symmetry, the, hamiltonian, as, a, function, of, generalized, coordinates, and, momenta, has, the, general, form, newton, s, laws, of, motion, they, are, low, limit, solutions, to, relativity, alternative, formulations, of, newtonian, mechanics, are, lagrangian, and, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, laws, can, be, summarized, by, two, equations, since, the, 1st, is, a, special, case, of, the, 2nd, zero, resultant, acceleration, where, p, momentum, of, body, f, ij, force, on, body, i, by, body, j, f, ji, force, on, body, j, by, body, i, for, a, dynamical, system, the, two, equations, effectively, combine, into, one, in, which, f, e, resultant, external, force, due, to, any, agent, not, part, of, system, body, i, does, not, exert, a, force, on, itself, from, the, above, any, equation, of, motion, in, classical, mechanics, can, be, derived, equations, describing, fluid, flow, in, various, situations, can, be, derived, using, the, above, classical, equations, of, motion, and, often, conservation, of, mass, energy, and, momentum, some, elementary, examples, follow, some, of, the, more, famous, laws, of, nature, are, found, in, isaac, newton, s, theories, of, now, classical, mechanics, presented, in, his, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, and, in, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, the, two, postulates, of, special, relativity, are, not, laws, in, themselves, but, assumptions, of, their, nature, in, terms, of, relative, motion, they, can, be, stated, as, the, laws, of, physics, are, the, same, in, all, inertial, frames, and, the, speed, of, light, is, constant, and, has, the, same, value, in, all, inertial, frames, the, said, postulates, lead, to, the, lorentz, transformations, the, transformation, law, between, two, frame, of, references, moving, relative, to, each, other, for, any, 4, vector, this, replaces, the, galilean, transformation, law, from, classical, mechanics, the, lorentz, transformations, reduce, to, the, galilean, transformations, for, low, velocities, much, less, than, the, speed, of, light, c, the, magnitudes, of, 4, vectors, are, invariants, not, conserved, but, the, same, for, all, inertial, frames, i, e, every, observer, in, an, inertial, frame, will, agree, on, the, same, value, in, particular, if, a, is, the, four, momentum, the, magnitude, can, derive, the, famous, invariant, equation, for, mass, energy, and, momentum, conservation, see, invariant, mass, in, which, the, more, famous, mass, energy, equivalence, e, mc, 2, is, a, special, case, general, relativity, is, governed, by, the, einstein, field, equations, which, describe, the, curvature, of, space, time, due, to, mass, energy, equivalent, to, the, gravitational, field, solving, the, equation, for, the, geometry, of, space, warped, due, to, the, mass, distribution, gives, the, metric, tensor, using, the, geodesic, equation, the, motion, of, masses, falling, along, the, geodesics, can, be, calculated, in, a, relatively, flat, spacetime, due, to, weak, gravitational, fields, gravitational, analogues, of, maxwell, s, equations, can, be, found, the, gem, equations, to, describe, an, analogous, gravitomagnetic, field, they, are, well, established, by, the, theory, and, experimental, tests, form, ongoing, research, where, cosmological, constant, r, ricci, curvature, tensor, t, stress, energy, tensor, g, metric, tensor, where, is, a, christoffel, symbol, of, the, second, kind, containing, the, metric, if, g, the, gravitational, field, and, h, the, gravitomagnetic, field, the, solutions, in, these, limits, are, where, is, the, mass, density, and, j, is, the, mass, current, density, or, mass, flux, where, m, is, the, rest, mass, of, the, particlce, and, is, the, lorentz, factor, kepler, s, laws, though, originally, discovered, from, planetary, observations, also, due, to, tycho, brahe, are, true, for, any, central, forces, for, two, point, masses, for, a, non, uniform, mass, distribution, of, local, mass, density, r, of, body, of, volume, v, this, becomes, an, equivalent, statement, to, newton, s, law, is, where, is, the, eccentricity, of, the, elliptic, orbit, of, semi, major, axis, a, and, semi, minor, axis, b, and, is, the, semi, latus, rectum, this, equation, in, itself, is, nothing, physically, fundamental, simply, the, polar, equation, of, an, ellipse, in, which, the, pole, origin, of, polar, coordinate, system, is, positioned, at, a, focus, of, the, ellipse, where, the, orbited, star, is, where, l, is, the, orbital, angular, momentum, of, the, particle, i, e, planet, of, mass, m, about, the, focus, of, orbit, where, m, is, the, mass, of, the, central, body, i, e, star, second, law, of, thermodynamics, there, are, many, statements, of, this, law, perhaps, the, simplest, is, the, entropy, of, isolated, systems, never, decreases, meaning, reversible, changes, have, zero, entropy, change, irreversible, process, are, positive, and, impossible, process, are, negative, third, law, of, thermodynamics, maxwell, s, equations, give, the, time, evolution, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, due, to, electric, charge, and, current, distributions, given, the, fields, the, lorentz, force, law, is, the, equation, of, motion, for, charges, in, the, fields, gauss, s, law, for, electricity, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, faraday, s, law, amp, re, s, circuital, law, with, maxwell, s, correction, these, equations, can, be, modified, to, include, magnetic, monopoles, and, are, consistent, with, our, observations, of, monopoles, either, existing, or, not, existing, if, they, do, not, exist, the, generalized, equations, reduce, to, the, ones, above, if, they, do, the, equations, become, fully, symmetric, in, electric, and, magnetic, charges, and, currents, indeed, there, is, a, duality, transformation, where, electric, and, magnetic, charges, can, be, rotated, into, one, another, and, still, satisfy, maxwell, s, equations, these, laws, were, found, before, the, formulation, of, maxwell, s, equations, they, are, not, fundamental, since, they, can, be, derived, from, maxwell, s, equations, coulomb, s, law, can, be, found, from, gauss, s, law, electrostatic, form, and, the, biot, savart, law, can, be, deduced, from, ampere, s, law, magnetostatic, form, lenz, s, law, and, faraday, s, law, can, be, incorporated, into, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, nonetheless, they, are, still, very, effective, for, simple, calculations, classically, optics, is, based, on, a, variational, principle, light, travels, from, one, point, in, space, to, another, in, the, shortest, time, in, geometric, optics, laws, are, based, on, approximations, in, euclidean, geometry, such, as, the, paraxial, approximation, in, physical, optics, laws, are, based, on, physical, properties, of, materials, in, actuality, optical, properties, of, matter, are, significantly, more, complex, and, require, quantum, mechanics, quantum, mechanics, has, its, roots, in, postulates, this, leads, to, results, which, are, not, usually, called, laws, but, hold, the, same, status, in, that, all, of, quantum, mechanics, follows, from, them, these, postulates, can, be, summarized, as, follows, these, postulates, in, turn, imply, many, other, phenomena, e, g, uncertainty, principles, and, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, schr, dinger, equation, general, form, describes, the, time, dependence, of, a, quantum, mechanical, system, the, hamiltonian, in, quantum, mechanics, h, is, a, self, adjoint, operator, acting, on, the, state, space, displaystyle, psi, rangle, see, dirac, notation, is, the, instantaneous, quantum, state, vector, at, time, t, position, r, i, is, the, unit, imaginary, number, h, 2, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, planck, einstein, law, the, energy, of, photons, is, proportional, to, the, frequency, of, the, light, the, constant, is, the, planck, constant, h, de, broglie, wavelength, this, laid, the, foundations, of, wave, particle, duality, and, was, the, key, concept, in, the, schr, dinger, equation, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, uncertainty, in, position, multiplied, by, uncertainty, in, momentum, is, at, least, half, of, the, reduced, planck, constant, similarly, for, time, and, energy, the, uncertainty, principle, can, be, generalized, to, any, pair, of, observables, see, main, article, schr, dinger, equation, original, form, where, r, i, is, the, position, of, particle, i, and, s, is, the, spin, of, the, particle, there, is, no, way, to, keep, track, of, particles, physically, labels, are, only, used, mathematically, to, prevent, confusion, applying, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and, quantum, mechanics, to, atoms, and, molecules, some, laws, of, electromagnetic, radiation, and, light, are, as, follows, chemical, laws, are, those, laws, of, nature, relevant, to, chemistry, historically, observations, led, to, many, empirical, laws, though, now, it, is, known, that, chemistry, has, its, foundations, in, quantum, mechanics, the, most, fundamental, concept, in, chemistry, is, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, which, states, that, there, is, no, detectable, change, in, the, quantity, of, matter, during, an, ordinary, chemical, reaction, modern, physics, shows, that, it, is, actually, energy, that, is, conserved, and, that, energy, and, mass, are, related, a, concept, which, becomes, important, in, nuclear, chemistry, conservation, of, energy, leads, to, the, important, concepts, of, equilibrium, thermodynamics, and, kinetics, additional, laws, of, chemistry, elaborate, on, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, joseph, proust, s, law, of, definite, composition, says, that, pure, chemicals, are, composed, of, elements, in, a, definite, formulation, we, now, know, that, the, structural, arrangement, of, these, elements, is, also, important, dalton, s, law, of, multiple, proportions, says, that, these, chemicals, will, present, themselves, in, proportions, that, are, small, whole, numbers, although, in, many, systems, notably, biomacromolecules, and, minerals, the, ratios, tend, to, require, large, numbers, and, are, frequently, represented, as, a, fraction, the, law, of, definite, composition, and, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, are, the, first, two, of, the, three, laws, of, stoichiometry, the, proportions, by, which, the, chemical, elements, combine, to, form, chemical, compounds, the, third, law, of, stoichiometry, is, the, law, of, reciprocal, proportions, which, provides, the, basis, for, establishing, equivalent, weights, for, each, chemical, element, elemental, equivalent, weights, can, then, be, used, to, derive, atomic, weights, for, each, element, more, modern, laws, of, chemistry, define, the, relationship, between, energy, and, its, transformations, whether, or, not, natural, selection, is, a, law, of, nature, is, controversial, among, biologists, henry, byerly, an, american, philosopher, known, for, his, work, on, evolutionary, theory, discussed, the, problem, of, interpreting, a, principle, of, natural, selection, as, a, law, he, suggested, a, formulation, of, natural, selection, as, a, framework, principle, that, can, contribute, to, a, better, understanding, of, evolutionary, theory, his, approach, was, to, express, relative, fitness, the, propensity, of, a, genotype, to, increase, in, proportionate, representation, in, a, competitive, environment, as, a, function, of, adaptedness, adaptive, design, of, the, organism, some, mathematical, theorems, and, axioms, are, referred, to, as, laws, because, they, provide, logical, foundation, to, empirical, laws, examples, of, other, observed, phenomena, sometimes, described, as, laws, include, the, titius, bode, law, of, planetary, positions, zipf, s, law, of, linguistics, and, moore, s, law, of, technological, growth, many, of, these, laws, fall, within, the, scope, of,
