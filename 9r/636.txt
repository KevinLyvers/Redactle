a, meander, is, one, of, a, series, of, regular, sinuous, curves, in, the, channel, of, a, river, or, other, watercourse, it, is, produced, as, a, watercourse, erodes, the, sediments, of, an, outer, concave, bank, cut, bank, or, river, cliff, and, deposits, sediments, on, an, inner, convex, bank, which, is, typically, a, point, bar, the, result, of, this, coupled, erosion, and, sedimentation, is, the, formation, of, a, sinuous, course, as, the, channel, migrates, back, and, forth, across, the, axis, of, a, floodplain, the, zone, within, which, a, meandering, stream, periodically, shifts, its, channel, is, known, as, a, meander, belt, it, typically, ranges, from, 15, to, 18, times, the, width, of, the, channel, over, time, meanders, migrate, downstream, sometimes, in, such, a, short, time, as, to, create, civil, engineering, challenges, for, local, municipalities, attempting, to, maintain, stable, roads, and, bridges, the, degree, of, meandering, of, the, channel, of, a, river, stream, or, other, watercourse, is, measured, by, its, sinuosity, the, sinuosity, of, a, watercourse, is, the, ratio, of, the, length, of, the, channel, to, the, straight, line, down, valley, distance, streams, or, rivers, with, a, single, channel, and, sinuosities, of, 1, 5, or, more, are, defined, as, meandering, streams, or, rivers, the, term, derives, from, the, winding, river, menderes, located, in, asia, minor, and, known, to, the, ancient, greeks, as, maiandros, latin, maeander, characterised, by, a, very, convoluted, path, along, the, lower, reach, as, a, result, even, in, classical, greece, and, in, later, greek, thought, the, name, of, the, river, had, become, a, common, noun, meaning, anything, convoluted, and, winding, such, as, decorative, patterns, or, speech, and, ideas, as, well, as, the, geomorphological, feature, strabo, said, its, course, is, so, exceedingly, winding, that, everything, winding, is, called, meandering, the, meander, river, is, south, of, izmir, east, of, the, ancient, greek, town, of, miletus, now, milet, turkey, it, flows, through, series, of, three, graben, in, the, menderes, massif, but, has, a, flood, plain, much, wider, than, the, meander, zone, in, its, lower, reach, its, modern, turkish, name, is, the, b, y, k, menderes, river, meanders, are, a, result, of, the, interaction, of, water, flowing, through, a, curved, channel, with, the, underlying, river, bed, this, produces, helicoidal, flow, in, which, water, moves, from, the, outer, to, the, inner, bank, along, the, river, bed, then, flows, back, to, the, outer, bank, near, the, surface, of, the, river, this, in, turn, increases, carrying, capacity, for, sediments, on, the, outer, bank, and, reduces, it, on, the, inner, bank, so, that, sediments, are, eroded, from, the, outer, bank, and, redeposited, on, the, inner, bank, of, the, next, downstream, meander, when, a, fluid, is, introduced, to, an, initially, straight, channel, which, then, bends, the, sidewalls, induce, a, pressure, gradient, that, causes, the, fluid, to, alter, course, and, follow, the, bend, from, here, two, opposing, processes, occur, 1, irrotational, flow, and, 2, secondary, flow, for, a, river, to, meander, secondary, flow, must, dominate, irrotational, flow, from, bernoulli, s, equations, high, pressure, results, in, low, velocity, therefore, in, the, absence, of, secondary, flow, we, would, expect, low, fluid, velocity, at, the, outside, bend, and, high, fluid, velocity, at, the, inside, bend, this, classic, fluid, mechanics, result, is, irrotational, vortex, flow, in, the, context, of, meandering, rivers, its, effects, are, dominated, by, those, of, secondary, flow, secondary, flow, a, force, balance, exists, between, pressure, forces, pointing, to, the, inside, bend, of, the, river, and, centrifugal, forces, pointing, to, the, outside, bend, of, the, river, in, the, context, of, meandering, rivers, a, boundary, layer, exists, within, the, thin, layer, of, fluid, that, interacts, with, the, river, bed, inside, that, layer, and, following, standard, boundary, layer, theory, the, velocity, of, the, fluid, is, effectively, zero, centrifugal, force, which, depends, on, velocity, is, also, therefore, effectively, zero, pressure, force, however, remains, unaffected, by, the, boundary, layer, therefore, within, the, boundary, layer, pressure, force, dominates, and, fluid, moves, along, the, bottom, of, the, river, from, the, outside, bend, to, the, inside, bend, this, initiates, helicoidal, flow, along, the, river, bed, fluid, roughly, follows, the, curve, of, the, channel, but, is, also, forced, toward, the, inside, bend, away, from, the, river, bed, fluid, also, roughly, follows, the, curve, of, the, channel, but, is, forced, to, some, extent, from, the, inside, to, the, outside, bend, the, higher, velocities, at, the, outside, bend, lead, to, higher, shear, stresses, and, therefore, result, in, erosion, similarly, lower, velocities, at, the, inside, bend, cause, lower, shear, stresses, and, deposition, occurs, thus, meander, bends, erode, at, the, outside, bend, causing, the, river, to, becoming, increasingly, sinuous, until, cutoff, events, occur, deposition, at, the, inside, bend, occurs, such, that, for, most, natural, meandering, rivers, the, river, width, remains, nearly, constant, even, as, the, river, evolves, in, a, speech, before, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, in, 1926, albert, einstein, suggested, that, because, the, coriolis, force, of, the, earth, can, cause, a, small, imbalance, in, velocity, distribution, such, that, velocity, on, one, bank, is, higher, than, on, the, other, it, could, trigger, the, erosion, on, one, bank, and, deposition, of, sediment, on, the, other, that, produces, meanders, however, coriolis, forces, are, likely, insignificant, compared, with, other, forces, acting, to, produce, river, meanders, the, technical, description, of, a, meandering, watercourse, is, termed, meander, geometry, or, meander, planform, geometry, it, is, characterized, as, an, irregular, waveform, ideal, waveforms, such, as, a, sine, wave, are, one, line, thick, but, in, the, case, of, a, stream, the, width, must, be, taken, into, consideration, the, bankfull, width, is, the, distance, across, the, bed, at, an, average, cross, section, at, the, full, stream, level, typically, estimated, by, the, line, of, lowest, vegetation, as, a, waveform, the, meandering, stream, follows, the, down, valley, axis, a, straight, line, fitted, to, the, curve, such, that, the, sum, of, all, the, amplitudes, measured, from, it, is, zero, this, axis, represents, the, overall, direction, of, the, stream, at, any, cross, section, the, flow, is, following, the, sinuous, axis, the, centerline, of, the, bed, two, consecutive, crossing, points, of, sinuous, and, down, valley, axes, define, a, meander, loop, the, meander, is, two, consecutive, loops, pointing, in, opposite, transverse, directions, the, distance, of, one, meander, along, the, down, valley, axis, is, the, meander, length, or, wavelength, the, maximum, distance, from, the, down, valley, axis, to, the, sinuous, axis, of, a, loop, is, the, meander, width, or, amplitude, the, course, at, that, point, is, the, apex, in, contrast, to, sine, waves, the, loops, of, a, meandering, stream, are, more, nearly, circular, the, curvature, varies, from, a, maximum, at, the, apex, to, zero, at, a, crossing, point, straight, line, also, called, an, inflection, because, the, curvature, changes, direction, in, that, vicinity, the, radius, of, the, loop, is, the, straight, line, perpendicular, to, the, down, valley, axis, intersecting, the, sinuous, axis, at, the, apex, as, the, loop, is, not, ideal, additional, information, is, needed, to, characterize, it, the, orientation, angle, is, the, angle, between, sinuous, axis, and, down, valley, axis, at, any, point, on, the, sinuous, axis, a, loop, at, the, apex, has, an, outer, or, concave, bank, and, an, inner, or, convex, bank, the, meander, belt, is, defined, by, an, average, meander, width, measured, from, outer, bank, to, outer, bank, instead, of, from, centerline, to, centerline, if, there, is, a, flood, plain, it, extends, beyond, the, meander, belt, the, meander, is, then, said, to, be, free, it, can, be, found, anywhere, in, the, flood, plain, if, there, is, no, flood, plain, the, meanders, are, fixed, various, mathematical, formulae, relate, the, variables, of, the, meander, geometry, as, it, turns, out, some, numerical, parameters, can, be, established, which, appear, in, the, formulae, the, waveform, depends, ultimately, on, the, characteristics, of, the, flow, but, the, parameters, are, independent, of, it, and, apparently, are, caused, by, geologic, factors, in, general, the, meander, length, is, 10, 14, times, with, an, average, 11, times, the, fullbank, channel, width, and, 3, to, 5, times, with, an, average, of, 4, 7, times, the, radius, of, curvature, at, the, apex, this, radius, is, 2, 3, times, the, channel, width, a, meander, has, a, depth, pattern, as, well, the, cross, overs, are, marked, by, riffles, or, shallow, beds, while, at, the, apices, are, pools, in, a, pool, direction, of, flow, is, downward, scouring, the, bed, material, the, major, volume, however, flows, more, slowly, on, the, inside, of, the, bend, where, due, to, decreased, velocity, it, deposits, sediment, the, line, of, maximum, depth, or, channel, is, the, thalweg, or, thalweg, line, it, is, typically, designated, the, borderline, when, rivers, are, used, as, political, borders, the, thalweg, hugs, the, outer, banks, and, returns, to, center, over, the, riffles, the, meander, arc, length, is, the, distance, along, the, thalweg, over, one, meander, the, river, length, is, the, length, along, the, centerline, once, a, channel, begins, to, follow, a, sinusoidal, path, the, amplitude, and, concavity, of, the, loops, increase, dramatically, this, is, due, to, the, effect, of, helical, flow, which, sweeps, dense, eroded, material, towards, the, inside, of, the, bend, and, leaves, the, outside, of, the, bend, unprotected, and, vulnerable, to, accelerated, erosion, this, establishes, a, positive, feedback, loop, in, the, words, of, elizabeth, a, wood, this, process, of, making, meanders, seems, to, be, a, self, intensifying, process, in, which, greater, curvature, results, in, more, erosion, of, the, bank, which, results, in, greater, curvature, the, cross, current, along, the, floor, of, the, channel, is, part, of, the, secondary, flow, and, sweeps, dense, eroded, material, towards, the, inside, of, the, bend, the, cross, current, then, rises, to, the, surface, near, the, inside, and, flows, towards, the, outside, forming, the, helical, flow, the, greater, the, curvature, of, the, bend, and, the, faster, the, flow, the, stronger, is, the, cross, current, and, the, sweeping, due, to, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, the, speed, on, the, inside, of, the, bend, is, faster, than, on, the, outside, since, the, flow, velocity, is, diminished, so, is, the, centrifugal, pressure, the, pressure, of, the, super, elevated, column, prevails, developing, an, unbalanced, gradient, that, moves, water, back, across, the, bottom, from, the, outside, to, the, inside, the, flow, is, supplied, by, a, counter, flow, across, the, surface, from, the, inside, to, the, outside, this, entire, situation, is, very, similar, to, the, tea, leaf, paradox, this, secondary, flow, carries, sediment, from, the, outside, of, the, bend, to, the, inside, making, the, river, more, meandering, as, to, why, streams, of, any, size, become, sinuous, in, the, first, place, there, are, a, number, of, theories, not, necessarily, mutually, exclusive, the, stochastic, theory, can, take, many, forms, but, one, of, the, most, general, statements, is, that, of, scheidegger, the, meander, train, is, assumed, to, be, the, result, of, the, stochastic, fluctuations, of, the, direction, of, flow, due, to, the, random, presence, of, direction, changing, obstacles, in, the, river, path, given, a, flat, smooth, tilted, artificial, surface, rainfall, runs, off, it, in, sheets, but, even, in, that, case, adhesion, of, water, to, the, surface, and, cohesion, of, drops, produce, rivulets, at, random, natural, surfaces, are, rough, and, erodible, to, different, degrees, the, result, of, all, the, physical, factors, acting, at, random, is, channels, that, are, not, straight, which, then, progressively, become, sinuous, even, channels, that, appear, straight, have, a, sinuous, thalweg, that, leads, eventually, to, a, sinuous, channel, in, the, equilibrium, theory, meanders, decrease, the, stream, gradient, until, an, equilibrium, between, the, erodibility, of, the, terrain, and, the, transport, capacity, of, the, stream, is, reached, a, mass, of, water, descending, must, give, up, potential, energy, which, given, the, same, velocity, at, the, end, of, the, drop, as, at, the, beginning, is, removed, by, interaction, with, the, material, of, the, stream, bed, the, shortest, distance, that, is, a, straight, channel, results, in, the, highest, energy, per, unit, of, length, disrupting, the, banks, more, creating, more, sediment, and, aggrading, the, stream, the, presence, of, meanders, allows, the, stream, to, adjust, the, length, to, an, equilibrium, energy, per, unit, length, in, which, the, stream, carries, away, all, the, sediment, that, it, produces, geomorphic, refers, to, the, surface, structure, of, the, terrain, morphotectonic, means, having, to, do, with, the, deeper, or, tectonic, plate, structure, of, the, rock, the, features, included, under, these, categories, are, not, random, and, guide, streams, into, non, random, paths, they, are, predictable, obstacles, that, instigate, meander, formation, by, deflecting, the, stream, for, example, the, stream, might, be, guided, into, a, fault, line, morphotectonic, a, cut, bank, is, an, often, vertical, bank, or, cliff, that, forms, where, the, outside, concave, bank, of, a, meander, cuts, into, the, floodplain, or, valley, wall, of, a, river, or, stream, a, cutbank, is, also, known, either, as, a, river, cut, cliff, river, cliff, or, a, bluff, and, spelled, as, cutbank, erosion, that, forms, a, cut, bank, occurs, at, the, outside, bank, of, a, meander, because, helicoidal, flow, of, water, keeps, the, bank, washed, clean, of, loose, sand, silt, and, sediment, and, subjects, it, to, constant, erosion, as, a, result, the, meander, erodes, and, migrates, in, the, direction, of, the, outside, bend, forming, the, cut, bank, as, the, cut, bank, is, undermined, by, erosion, it, commonly, collapses, as, slumps, into, the, river, channel, the, slumped, sediment, having, been, broken, up, by, slumping, is, readily, eroded, and, carried, toward, the, middle, of, the, channel, the, sediment, eroded, from, a, cut, bank, tends, to, be, deposited, on, the, point, bar, of, the, next, downstream, meander, and, not, on, the, point, bar, opposite, it, this, can, be, seen, in, areas, where, trees, grow, on, the, banks, of, rivers, on, the, inside, of, meanders, trees, such, as, willows, are, often, far, from, the, bank, whilst, on, the, outside, of, the, bend, the, tree, roots, are, often, exposed, and, undercut, eventually, leading, the, trees, to, fall, into, the, river, a, meander, cutoff, also, known, as, either, a, cutoff, meander, or, abandoned, meander, is, a, meander, that, has, been, abandoned, by, its, stream, after, the, formation, of, a, neck, cutoff, a, lake, that, occupies, a, cutoff, meander, is, known, as, an, oxbow, lake, cutoff, meanders, that, have, cut, downward, into, the, underlying, bedrock, are, known, in, general, as, incised, cutoff, meanders, as, in, the, case, of, the, anderson, bottom, rincon, incised, meanders, that, have, either, steep, sided, often, vertical, walls, are, often, but, not, always, known, as, rincons, in, the, southwest, united, states, rincon, in, english, is, a, nontechnical, word, in, the, southwest, united, states, for, either, a, small, secluded, valley, an, alcove, or, angular, recess, in, a, cliff, or, a, bend, in, a, river, the, meanders, of, a, stream, or, river, that, has, cut, its, bed, down, into, the, bedrock, are, known, as, either, incised, intrenched, entrenched, inclosed, or, ingrown, meanders, some, earth, scientists, recognize, and, use, a, finer, subdivision, of, incised, meanders, thornbury, argues, that, incised, or, inclosed, meanders, are, synonyms, that, are, appropriate, to, describe, any, meander, incised, downward, into, bedrock, and, defines, enclosed, or, entrenched, meanders, as, a, subtype, of, incised, meanders, inclosed, meanders, characterized, by, a, symmetrical, valley, sides, he, argues, that, the, symmetrical, valley, sides, are, the, direct, result, of, rapid, down, cutting, of, a, watercourse, into, bedrock, in, addition, as, proposed, by, rich, thornbury, argues, that, incised, valleys, with, a, pronounced, asymmetry, of, cross, section, which, he, called, ingrown, meanders, are, the, result, of, the, lateral, migration, and, incision, of, a, meander, during, a, period, of, slower, channel, downcutting, regardless, the, formation, of, both, entrenched, meanders, and, ingrown, meanders, is, thought, to, require, that, base, level, falls, as, a, result, of, either, relative, change, in, mean, sea, level, isostatic, or, tectonic, uplift, the, breach, of, an, ice, or, landslide, dam, or, regional, tilting, classic, examples, of, incised, meanders, are, associated, with, rivers, in, the, colorado, plateau, the, kentucky, river, palisades, in, central, kentucky, and, streams, in, the, ozark, plateau, as, noted, above, it, was, initially, either, argued, or, presumed, that, an, incised, meander, is, characteristic, of, an, antecedent, stream, or, river, that, had, incised, its, channel, into, underlying, strata, an, antecedent, stream, or, river, is, one, that, maintains, its, original, course, and, pattern, during, incision, despite, the, changes, in, underlying, rock, topography, and, rock, types, however, later, geologists, argue, that, the, shape, of, an, incised, meander, is, not, always, if, ever, inherited, e, g, strictly, from, an, antecedent, meandering, stream, where, its, meander, pattern, could, freely, develop, on, a, level, floodplain, instead, they, argue, that, as, fluvial, incision, of, bedrock, proceeds, the, stream, course, is, significantly, modified, by, variations, in, rock, type, and, fractures, faults, and, other, geological, structures, into, either, lithologically, conditioned, meanders, or, structurally, controlled, meanders, the, oxbow, lake, which, is, the, most, common, type, of, fluvial, lake, is, a, crescent, shaped, lake, that, derives, its, name, from, its, distinctive, curved, shape, oxbow, lakes, are, also, known, as, cutoff, lakes, such, lakes, form, regularly, in, undisturbed, floodplains, as, a, result, of, the, normal, process, of, fluvial, meandering, either, a, river, or, stream, forms, a, sinuous, channel, as, the, outer, side, of, its, bends, are, eroded, away, and, sediments, accumulate, on, the, inner, side, which, forms, a, meandering, horseshoe, shaped, bend, eventually, as, the, result, of, its, meandering, the, fluvial, channel, cuts, through, the, narrow, neck, of, the, meander, and, forms, a, cutoff, meander, the, final, break, through, of, the, neck, which, is, called, a, neck, cutoff, often, occurs, during, a, major, flood, because, that, is, when, the, watercourse, is, out, of, its, banks, and, can, flow, directly, across, the, neck, and, erode, it, with, the, full, force, of, the, flood, after, a, cutoff, meander, is, formed, river, water, flows, into, its, end, from, the, river, builds, small, delta, like, feature, into, either, end, of, it, during, floods, these, delta, like, features, block, either, end, of, the, cutoff, meander, to, form, a, stagnant, oxbow, lake, that, is, separated, from, the, flow, of, the, fluvial, channel, and, independent, of, the, river, during, floods, the, flood, waters, deposit, fine, grained, sediment, into, the, oxbow, lake, as, a, result, oxbow, lakes, tend, to, become, filled, in, with, fine, grained, organic, rich, sediments, over, time, a, point, bar, which, is, also, known, as, a, meander, bar, is, a, fluvial, bar, that, is, formed, by, the, slow, often, episodic, addition, of, individual, accretions, of, noncohesive, sediment, on, the, inside, bank, of, a, meander, by, the, accompanying, migration, of, the, channel, toward, its, outer, bank, this, process, is, called, lateral, accretion, lateral, accretion, occurs, mostly, during, high, water, or, floods, when, the, point, bar, is, submerged, typically, the, sediment, consists, of, either, sand, gravel, or, a, combination, of, both, the, sediment, comprising, some, point, bars, might, grade, downstream, into, silty, sediments, because, of, the, decreasing, velocity, and, strength, of, current, from, the, thalweg, of, the, channel, to, the, upper, surface, of, point, bar, when, the, sediment, is, deposited, the, vertical, sequence, of, sediments, comprising, a, point, bar, becomes, finer, upward, within, an, individual, point, bar, for, example, it, is, typical, for, point, bars, to, fine, upward, from, gravel, at, the, base, to, fine, sands, at, the, top, the, source, of, the, sediment, is, typically, upstream, cut, banks, from, which, sand, rocks, and, debris, has, been, eroded, swept, and, rolled, across, the, bed, of, the, river, and, downstream, to, the, inside, bank, of, a, river, bend, on, the, inside, bend, this, sediment, and, debris, is, eventually, deposited, on, the, slip, off, slope, of, a, point, bar, scroll, bars, are, a, result, of, continuous, lateral, migration, of, a, meander, loop, that, creates, an, asymmetrical, ridge, and, swale, topography, on, the, inside, of, the, bends, the, topography, is, generally, parallel, to, the, meander, and, is, related, to, migrating, bar, forms, and, back, bar, chutes, which, carve, sediment, from, the, outside, of, the, curve, and, deposit, sediment, in, the, slower, flowing, water, on, the, inside, of, the, loop, in, a, process, called, lateral, accretion, scroll, bar, sediments, are, characterized, by, cross, bedding, and, a, pattern, of, fining, upward, these, characteristics, are, a, result, of, the, dynamic, river, system, where, larger, grains, are, transported, during, high, energy, flood, events, and, then, gradually, die, down, depositing, smaller, material, with, time, batty, 2006, deposits, for, meandering, rivers, are, generally, homogeneous, and, laterally, extensive, unlike, the, more, heterogeneous, braided, river, deposits, there, are, two, distinct, patterns, of, scroll, bar, depositions, the, eddy, accretion, scroll, bar, pattern, and, the, point, bar, scroll, pattern, when, looking, down, the, river, valley, they, can, be, distinguished, because, the, point, bar, scroll, patterns, are, convex, and, the, eddy, accretion, scroll, bar, patterns, are, concave, scroll, bars, often, look, lighter, at, the, tops, of, the, ridges, and, darker, in, the, swales, this, is, because, the, tops, can, be, shaped, by, wind, either, adding, fine, grains, or, by, keeping, the, area, unvegetated, while, the, darkness, in, the, swales, can, be, attributed, to, silts, and, clays, washing, in, during, high, water, periods, this, added, sediment, in, addition, to, water, that, catches, in, the, swales, is, in, turn, is, a, favorable, environment, for, vegetation, that, will, also, accumulate, in, the, swales, depending, upon, whether, a, meander, is, part, of, an, entrenched, river, or, part, of, a, freely, meandering, river, within, a, floodplain, the, term, slip, off, slope, can, refer, to, two, different, fluvial, landforms, that, comprise, the, inner, convex, bank, of, a, meander, loop, in, case, of, a, freely, meandering, river, on, a, floodplain, a, slip, off, slope, is, the, inside, gently, sloping, bank, of, a, meander, on, which, sediments, episodically, accumulate, to, form, a, point, bar, as, a, river, meanders, this, type, of, slip, off, slope, is, located, opposite, the, cutbank, this, term, can, also, be, applied, to, the, inside, sloping, bank, of, a, meandering, tidal, channel, in, case, of, an, entrenched, river, a, slip, off, slope, is, a, gently, sloping, bedrock, surface, that, rises, from, the, inside, concave, bank, of, an, asymmetrically, entrenched, river, this, type, of, slip, off, slope, is, often, covered, by, a, thin, discontinuous, layer, of, alluvium, it, is, produced, by, the, gradual, outward, migration, of, the, meander, as, a, river, cuts, downward, into, bedrock, a, terrace, on, the, slip, off, slope, of, a, meander, spur, known, as, slip, off, slope, terrace, can, be, formed, by, a, brief, halt, during, the, irregular, incision, by, an, actively, meandering, river, the, meander, ratio, or, sinuosity, index, is, a, means, of, quantifying, how, much, a, river, or, stream, meanders, how, much, its, course, deviates, from, the, shortest, possible, path, it, is, calculated, as, the, length, of, the, stream, divided, by, the, length, of, the, valley, a, perfectly, straight, river, would, have, a, meander, ratio, of, 1, it, would, be, the, same, length, as, its, valley, while, the, higher, this, ratio, is, above, 1, the, more, the, river, meanders, sinuosity, indices, are, calculated, from, the, map, or, from, an, aerial, photograph, measured, over, a, distance, called, the, reach, which, should, be, at, least, 20, times, the, average, fullbank, channel, width, the, length, of, the, stream, is, measured, by, channel, or, thalweg, length, over, the, reach, while, the, bottom, value, of, the, ratio, is, the, downvalley, length, or, air, distance, of, the, stream, between, two, points, on, it, defining, the, reach, the, sinuosity, index, plays, a, part, in, mathematical, descriptions, of, streams, the, index, may, require, elaboration, because, the, valley, may, meander, as, well, i, e, the, downvalley, length, is, not, identical, to, the, reach, in, that, case, the, valley, index, is, the, meander, ratio, of, the, valley, while, the, channel, index, is, the, meander, ratio, of, the, channel, the, channel, sinuosity, index, is, the, channel, length, divided, by, the, valley, length, and, the, standard, sinuosity, index, is, the, channel, index, divided, by, the, valley, index, distinctions, may, become, even, more, subtle, sinuosity, index, has, a, non, mathematical, utility, as, well, streams, can, be, placed, in, categories, arranged, by, it, for, example, when, the, index, is, between, 1, and, 1, 5, the, river, is, sinuous, but, if, between, 1, 5, and, 4, then, meandering, the, index, is, a, measure, also, of, stream, velocity, and, sediment, load, those, quantities, being, maximized, at, an, index, of, 1, straight
