the, acre, e, k, r, ay, k, r, is, a, unit, of, land, area, used, in, the, british, imperial, and, the, united, states, customary, systems, it, is, traditionally, defined, as, the, area, of, one, chain, by, one, furlong, 66, by, 660, feet, which, is, exactly, equal, to, 10, square, chains, 1, 640, of, a, square, mile, 4, 840, square, yards, or, 43, 560, square, feet, and, approximately, 4, 047, m, 2, or, about, 40, of, a, hectare, based, upon, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, 1959, an, acre, may, be, declared, as, exactly, 4, 046, 8564224, square, metres, the, acre, is, sometimes, abbreviated, ac, but, is, usually, spelled, out, as, the, word, acre, traditionally, in, the, middle, ages, an, acre, was, conceived, of, as, the, area, of, land, that, could, be, ploughed, by, one, man, using, a, team, of, eight, oxen, in, one, day, the, acre, is, still, a, statutory, measure, in, the, united, states, both, the, international, acre, and, the, us, survey, acre, are, in, use, but, they, differ, by, only, four, parts, per, million, see, below, the, most, common, use, of, the, acre, is, to, measure, tracts, of, land, the, acre, is, used, in, many, established, and, former, commonwealth, of, nations, countries, by, custom, in, a, few, it, continues, as, a, statute, measure, although, not, since, 2010, in, the, uk, and, not, for, decades, in, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, in, many, places, where, it, is, not, a, statute, measure, it, is, still, lawful, to, use, for, trade, if, given, as, supplementary, information, and, is, not, used, for, land, registration, one, acre, equals, 1, 640, 0, 0015625, square, mile, 4, 840, square, yards, 43, 560, square, feet, or, about, 4, 047, square, metres, 0, 4047, hectares, see, below, while, all, modern, variants, of, the, acre, contain, 4, 840, square, yards, there, are, alternative, definitions, of, a, yard, so, the, exact, size, of, an, acre, depends, upon, the, particular, yard, on, which, it, is, based, originally, an, acre, was, understood, as, a, strip, of, land, sized, at, forty, perches, 660, ft, or, 1, furlong, long, and, four, perches, 66, ft, wide, this, may, have, also, been, understood, as, an, approximation, of, the, amount, of, land, a, yoke, of, oxen, could, plough, in, one, day, a, furlong, being, a, furrow, long, a, square, enclosing, one, acre, is, approximately, 69, 57, yards, or, 208, feet, 9, inches, 63, 61, metres, on, a, side, as, a, unit, of, measure, an, acre, has, no, prescribed, shape, any, area, of, 43, 560, square, feet, is, an, acre, in, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, 1959, the, united, states, and, five, countries, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, defined, the, international, yard, to, be, exactly, 0, 9144, metre, the, us, authorities, decided, that, while, the, refined, definition, would, apply, nationally, in, all, other, respects, the, us, survey, foot, and, thus, the, survey, acre, would, continue, until, such, a, time, as, it, becomes, desirable, and, expedient, to, readjust, by, inference, an, international, acre, may, be, calculated, as, exactly, 4, 046, 856, 422, 4, square, metres, but, it, does, not, have, a, basis, in, any, international, agreement, both, the, international, acre, and, the, us, survey, acre, contain, 1, 640, of, a, square, mile, or, 4, 840, square, yards, but, alternative, definitions, of, a, yard, are, used, see, survey, foot, and, survey, yard, so, the, exact, size, of, an, acre, depends, upon, the, yard, upon, which, it, is, based, the, us, survey, acre, is, about, 4, 046, 872, square, metres, its, exact, value, 4046, 13, 525, 426, 15, 499, 969, m, 2, is, based, on, an, inch, defined, by, 1, metre, 39, 37, inches, exactly, as, established, by, the, mendenhall, order, of, 1893, surveyors, in, the, united, states, use, both, international, and, survey, feet, and, consequently, both, varieties, of, acre, since, the, difference, between, the, us, survey, acre, and, international, acre, 0, 016, square, metres, 160, square, centimetres, or, 24, 8, square, inches, is, only, about, a, quarter, of, the, size, of, an, a4, sheet, or, us, letter, it, is, usually, not, important, which, one, is, being, discussed, areas, are, seldom, measured, with, sufficient, accuracy, for, the, different, definitions, to, be, detectable, in, october, 2019, the, us, national, geodetic, survey, and, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, announced, their, joint, intent, to, end, the, temporary, continuance, of, the, us, survey, foot, mile, and, acre, units, as, permitted, by, their, 1959, decision, above, with, effect, from, the, end, of, 2022, the, puerto, rican, cuerda, 0, 39, ha, 0, 97, acres, is, sometimes, called, the, spanish, acre, in, the,

statute, as, used, in, the, uk, not, the, old, irish, acre, which, was, of, a, different, size, is, still, widely, used, especially, in, agriculture, in, the, republic, of, india, residential, plots, are, measured, in, square, feet, or, square, metre, while, agricultural, land, is, measured, in, acres, in, sri, lanka, the, division, of, an, acre, into, 160, perches, or, 4, roods, is, common, in,

the, 1994, amendment, of, the, weights, and, measures, act, where, it, was, replaced, by, the, hectare, though, its, use, as, a, supplementary, unit, continues, to, be, permitted, indefinitely, this, was, with, the, exemption, of, land, registration, which, records, the, sale, and, possession, of, land, in, 2010, hm, land, registry, ended, its, exemption, the, measure, is, still, used, to,

survey, acre, is, equal, to, 1, acre, both, variants, is, equal, to, the, following, customary, units, perhaps, the, easiest, way, for, us, residents, to, envision, an, acre, is, as, a, rectangle, measuring, 88, yards, by, 55, yards, 1, 10, of, 880, yards, by, 1, 16, of, 880, yards, about, 9, 10, the, size, of, a, standard, american, football, field, to, be, more, exact, one, acre, is, 90, 75, of, a, 100, yd, long, by, 53, 33, yd, wide, american, football, field, without, the, end, zone, the, full, field, including, the, end, zones, covers, about, 1, 32, acres, 0, 53, ha, for, residents, of, other, countries, the, acre, might, be, envisioned, as, rather, more, than, half, of, a, 1, 76, acres, 0, 71, ha, football, pitch, the, word, acre, is, derived, from, old, english, cer, originally, meaning, open, field, cognate, with, norwegian, ker, icelandic, akur, swedish, ker, german, acker, dutch, akker, latin, ager, sanskrit, ajr, and, greek, agros, in, english, an, obsolete, variant, spelling, was, aker, according, to, the, act, on, the, composition, of, yards, and, perches, dating, from, around, 1300, an, acre, is, 40, perches, in, length, and, four, in, breadth, meaning, 220, yards, by, 22, yards, as, detailed, in, the, diagram, an, acre, was, roughly, the, amount, of, land, tillable, by, a, yoke, of, oxen, in, one, day, before, the, enactment, of, the, metric, system, many, countries, in, europe, used, their, own, official, acres, in, france, the, traditional, unit, of, area, was, the, arpent, carr, a, measure, based, on, the, roman, system, of, land, measurement, the, acre, was, used, only, in, normandy, and, neighbouring, places, outside, its, traditional, borders, but, its, value, varied, greatly, across, normandy, ranging, from, 3, 632, to, 9, 725, square, metres, with, 8, 172, square, metres, being, the, most, frequent, value, but, inside, the, same, pays, of, normandy, for, instance, in, pays, de, caux, the, farmers, still, in, the, 20th, century, made, the, difference, between, the, grande, acre, 68, ares, 66, centiares, and, the, petite, acre, 56, to, 65, ca, the, normandy, acre, was, usually, divided, in, 4, verg, es,

in, canada, the, paris, arpent, used, in, quebec, before, the, metric, system, was, adopted, is, sometimes, called, french, acre, in, english, even, though, the, paris, arpent, and, the, normandy, acre, were, two, very, different, units, of, area, in, ancient, france, the, paris, arpent, became, the, unit, of, area, of, french, canada, whereas, the, normandy, acre, was, never, used, in, french, canada, in, germany, the, netherlands, and, eastern, europe, the, traditional, unit, of, area, was, morgen, like, the, acre, the, morgen, was, a, unit, of, ploughland, representing, a, strip, that, could, be, ploughed, by, one, man, and, an, ox, or, horse, in, a, morning, there, were, many, variants, of, the, morgen, differing, between, the, different, german, territories, ranging, from, 1, 2, to, 2, 1, 2, acres, 2, 000, to, 10, 100, m, 2, it, was, also, used, in, old, prussia, in, the, balkans, norway, and, denmark, where, it, was, equal, to, about, two, thirds, acre, 2, 700, m, 2, statutory, values, for, the, acre, were, enacted, in, england, and, subsequently, the, united, kingdom, by, acts, of, historically, the, size, of, farms, and, landed, estates, in, the, united, kingdom, was, usually, expressed, in, acres, or, acres, roods, and, perches, even, if, the, number, of, acres, was, so, large, that, it, might, conveniently, have, been, expressed, in, square, miles, for, example, a, certain, landowner, might, have, been, said, to, own, 32, 000, acres, of, land, not, 50, square, miles, of, land, the, acre, is, related, to, the, square, mile, with, 640, acres, making, up, one, square, mile, one, mile, is, 5280, feet, 1760, yards, in, western, canada, and, the, western, united, states, divisions, of, land, area, were, typically, based, on, the, square, mile, and, fractions, thereof, if, the, square, mile, is, divided, into, quarters, each, quarter, has, a, side, length, of, 1, 2, mile, 880, yards, and, is, 1, 4, square, mile, in, area, or, 160, acres, these, subunits, are, typically, then, again, divided, into, quarters, with, each, side, being, 1, 4, mile, long, and, being, 1, 16, of, a, square, mile, in, area, or, 40, acres, in, the, united, states, farmland, was, typically, divided, as, such, and, the, phrase, the, back, 40, refers, to, the, 40, acre, parcel, to, the, back, of, the, farm, most, of, the, canadian, prairie, provinces, and, the, us, midwest, are, on, square, mile, grids, for, surveying, purposes
