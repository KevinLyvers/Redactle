in, chemistry, a, molecular, orbital, r, b, d, l, is, a, mathematical, function, describing, the, location, and, wave, like, behavior, of, an, electron, in, a, molecule, this, function, can, be, used, to, calculate, chemical, and, physical, properties, such, as, the, probability, of, finding, an, electron, in, any, specific, region, the, terms, atomic, orbital, and, molecular, orbital, were, introduced, by, robert, s, mulliken, in, 1932, to, mean, one, electron, orbital, wave, functions, at, an, elementary, level, they, are, used, to, describe, the, region, of, space, in, which, a, function, has, a, significant, amplitude, in, an, isolated, atom, the, orbital, electrons, location, is, determined, by, functions, called, atomic, orbitals, when, multiple, atoms, combine, chemically, into, a, molecule, by, forming, a, valence, chemical, bond, the, electrons, locations, are, determined, by, the, molecule, as, a, whole, so, the, atomic, orbitals, combine, to, form, molecular, orbitals, the, electrons, from, the, constituent, atoms, occupy, the, molecular, orbitals, mathematically, molecular, orbitals, are, an, approximate, solution, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, the, electrons, in, the, field, of, the, molecule, s, atomic, nuclei, they, are, usually, constructed, by, combining, atomic, orbitals, or, hybrid, orbitals, from, each, atom, of, the, molecule, or, other, molecular, orbitals, from, groups, of, atoms, they, can, be, quantitatively, calculated, using, the, hartree, fock, or, self, consistent, field, scf, methods, molecular, orbitals, are, of, three, types, bonding, orbitals, which, have, an, energy, lower, than, the, energy, of, the, atomic, orbitals, which, formed, them, and, thus, promote, the, chemical, bonds, which, hold, the, molecule, together, antibonding, orbitals, which, have, an, energy, higher, than, the, energy, of, their, constituent, atomic, orbitals, and, so, oppose, the, bonding, of, the, molecule, and, non, bonding, orbitals, which, have, the, same, energy, as, their, constituent, atomic, orbitals, and, thus, have, no, effect, on, the, bonding, of, the, molecule, a, molecular, orbital, mo, can, be, used, to, represent, the, regions, in, a, molecule, where, an, electron, occupying, that, orbital, is, likely, to, be, found, molecular, orbitals, are, approximate, solutions, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, the, electrons, in, the, electric, field, of, the, molecule, s, atomic, nuclei, however, calculating, the, orbitals, directly, from, this, equation, is, far, too, intractable, a, problem, instead, they, are, obtained, from, the, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, which, predict, the, location, of, an, electron, in, an, atom, a, molecular, orbital, can, specify, the, electron, configuration, of, a, molecule, the, spatial, distribution, and, energy, of, one, or, one, pair, of, electron, s, most, commonly, a, mo, is, represented, as, a, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, the, lcao, mo, method, especially, in, qualitative, or, very, approximate, usage, they, are, invaluable, in, providing, a, simple, model, of, bonding, in, molecules, understood, through, molecular, orbital, theory, most, present, day, methods, in, computational, chemistry, begin, by, calculating, the, mos, of, the, system, a, molecular, orbital, describes, the, behavior, of, one, electron, in, the, electric, field, generated, by, the, nuclei, and, some, average, distribution, of, the, other, electrons, in, the, case, of, two, electrons, occupying, the, same, orbital, the, pauli, principle, demands, that, they, have, opposite, spin, necessarily, this, is, an, approximation, and, highly, accurate, descriptions, of, the, molecular, electronic, wave, function, do, not, have, orbitals, see, configuration, interaction, molecular, orbitals, are, in, general, delocalized, throughout, the, entire, molecule, moreover, if, the, molecule, has, symmetry, elements, its, nondegenerate, molecular, orbitals, are, either, symmetric, or, antisymmetric, with, respect, to, any, of, these, symmetries, in, other, words, the, application, of, a, symmetry, operation, s, e, g, a, reflection, rotation, or, inversion, to, molecular, orbital, results, in, the, molecular, orbital, being, unchanged, or, reversing, its, mathematical, sign, s, in, planar, molecules, for, example, molecular, orbitals, are, either, symmetric, sigma, or, antisymmetric, pi, with, respect, to, reflection, in, the, molecular, plane, if, molecules, with, degenerate, orbital, energies, are, also, considered, a, more, general, statement, that, molecular, orbitals, form, bases, for, the, irreducible, representations, of, the, molecule, s, symmetry, group, holds, the, symmetry, properties, of, molecular, orbitals, means, that, delocalization, is, an, inherent, feature, of, molecular, orbital, theory, and, makes, it, fundamentally, different, from, and, complementary, to, valence, bond, theory, in, which, bonds, are, viewed, as, localized, electron, pairs, with, allowance, for, resonance, to, account, for, delocalization, in, contrast, to, these, symmetry, adapted, canonical, molecular, orbitals, localized, molecular, orbitals, can, be, formed, by, applying, certain, mathematical, transformations, to, the, canonical, orbitals, the, advantage, of, this, approach, is, that, the, orbitals, will, correspond, more, closely, to, the, bonds, of, a, molecule, as, depicted, by, a, lewis, structure, as, a, disadvantage, the, energy, levels, of, these, localized, orbitals, no, longer, have, physical, meaning, the, discussion, in, the, rest, of, this, article, will, focus, on, canonical, molecular, orbitals, for, further, discussions, on, localized, molecular, orbitals, see, natural, bond, orbital, and, sigma, pi, and, equivalent, orbital, models, molecular, orbitals, arise, from, allowed, interactions, between, atomic, orbitals, which, are, allowed, if, the, symmetries, determined, from, group, theory, of, the, atomic, orbitals, are, compatible, with, each, other, efficiency, of, atomic, orbital, interactions, is, determined, from, the, overlap, a, measure, of, how, well, two, orbitals, constructively, interact, with, one, another, between, two, atomic, orbitals, which, is, significant, if, the, atomic, orbitals, are, close, in, energy, finally, the, number, of, molecular, orbitals, formed, must, be, equal, to, the, number, of, atomic, orbitals, in, the, atoms, being, combined, to, form, the, molecule, for, an, imprecise, but, qualitatively, useful, discussion, of, the, molecular, structure, the, molecular, orbitals, can, be, obtained, from, the, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, molecular, orbital, method, ansatz, here, the, molecular, orbitals, are, expressed, as, linear, combinations, of, atomic, orbitals, molecular, orbitals, were, first, introduced, by, friedrich, hund, and, robert, s, mulliken, in, 1927, and, 1928, the, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, or, lcao, approximation, for, molecular, orbitals, was, introduced, in, 1929, by, sir, john, lennard, jones, his, ground, breaking, paper, showed, how, to, derive, the, electronic, structure, of, the, fluorine, and, oxygen, molecules, from, quantum, principles, this, qualitative, approach, to, molecular, orbital, theory, is, part, of, the, start, of, modern, quantum, chemistry, linear, combinations, of, atomic, orbitals, lcao, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, molecular, orbitals, that, are, formed, upon, bonding, between, the, molecule, s, constituent, atoms, similar, to, an, atomic, orbital, a, schr, dinger, equation, which, describes, the, behavior, of, an, electron, can, be, constructed, for, a, molecular, orbital, as, well, linear, combinations, of, atomic, orbitals, or, the, sums, and, differences, of, the, atomic, wavefunctions, provide, approximate, solutions, to, the, hartree, fock, equations, which, correspond, to, the, independent, particle, approximation, of, the, molecular, schr, dinger, equation, for, simple, diatomic, molecules, the, wavefunctions, obtained, are, represented, mathematically, by, the, equations, where, displaystyle, psi, and, displaystyle, psi, are, the, molecular, wavefunctions, for, the, bonding, and, antibonding, molecular, orbitals, respectively, a, displaystyle, psi, a, and, b, displaystyle, psi, b, are, the, atomic, wavefunctions, from, atoms, a, and, b, respectively, and, c, a, displaystyle, c, a, and, c, b, displaystyle, c, b, are, adjustable, coefficients, these, coefficients, can, be, positive, or, negative, depending, on, the, energies, and, symmetries, of, the, individual, atomic, orbitals, as, the, two, atoms, become, closer, together, their, atomic, orbitals, overlap, to, produce, areas, of, high, electron, density, and, as, a, consequence, molecular, orbitals, are, formed, between, the, two, atoms, the, atoms, are, held, together, by, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, the, positively, charged, nuclei, and, the, negatively, charged, electrons, occupying, bonding, molecular, orbitals, when, atomic, orbitals, interact, the, resulting, molecular, orbital, can, be, of, three, types, bonding, antibonding, or, nonbonding, bonding, mos, antibonding, mos, nonbonding, mos, the, type, of, interaction, between, atomic, orbitals, can, be, further, categorized, by, the, molecular, orbital, symmetry, labels, sigma, pi, delta, phi, gamma, etc, these, are, the, greek, letters, corresponding, to, the, atomic, orbitals, s, p, d, f, and, g, respectively, the, number, of, nodal, planes, containing, the, internuclear, axis, between, the, atoms, concerned, is, zero, for, mos, one, for, two, for, three, for, and, four, for, a, mo, with, symmetry, results, from, the, interaction, of, either, two, atomic, s, orbitals, or, two, atomic, p, z, orbitals, an, mo, will, have, symmetry, if, the, orbital, is, symmetric, with, respect, to, the, axis, joining, the, two, nuclear, centers, the, internuclear, axis, this, means, that, rotation, of, the, mo, about, the, internuclear, axis, does, not, result, in, a, phase, change, a, orbital, sigma, antibonding, orbital, also, maintains, the, same, phase, when, rotated, about, the, internuclear, axis, the, orbital, has, a, nodal, plane, that, is, between, the, nuclei, and, perpendicular, to, the, internuclear, axis, a, mo, with, symmetry, results, from, the, interaction, of, either, two, atomic, p, x, orbitals, or, p, y, orbitals, an, mo, will, have, symmetry, if, the, orbital, is, asymmetric, with, respect, to, rotation, about, the, internuclear, axis, this, means, that, rotation, of, the, mo, about, the, internuclear, axis, will, result, in, a, phase, change, there, is, one, nodal, plane, containing, the, internuclear, axis, if, real, orbitals, are, considered, a, orbital, pi, antibonding, orbital, will, also, produce, a, phase, change, when, rotated, about, the, internuclear, axis, the, orbital, also, has, a, second, nodal, plane, between, the, nuclei, a, mo, with, symmetry, results, from, the, interaction, of, two, atomic, d, xy, or, d, x, 2, y, 2, orbitals, because, these, molecular, orbitals, involve, low, energy, d, atomic, orbitals, they, are, seen, in, transition, metal, complexes, a, bonding, orbital, has, two, nodal, planes, containing, the, internuclear, axis, and, a, antibonding, orbital, also, has, a, third, nodal, plane, between, the, nuclei, theoretical, chemists, have, conjectured, that, higher, order, bonds, such, as, phi, bonds, corresponding, to, overlap, of, f, atomic, orbitals, are, possible, there, is, no, known, example, of, a, molecule, purported, to, contain, a, phi, bond, for, molecules, that, possess, a, center, of, inversion, centrosymmetric, molecules, there, are, additional, labels, of, symmetry, that, can, be, applied, to, molecular, orbitals, centrosymmetric, molecules, include, non, centrosymmetric, molecules, include, if, inversion, through, the, center, of, symmetry, in, a, molecule, results, in, the, same, phases, for, the, molecular, orbital, then, the, mo, is, said, to, have, gerade, g, symmetry, from, the, german, word, for, even, if, inversion, through, the, center, of, symmetry, in, a, molecule, results, in, a, phase, change, for, the, molecular, orbital, then, the, mo, is, said, to, have, ungerade, u, symmetry, from, the, german, word, for, odd, for, a, bonding, mo, with, symmetry, the, orbital, is, g, s, s, is, symmetric, while, an, antibonding, mo, with, symmetry, the, orbital, is, u, because, inversion, of, s, s, is, antisymmetric, for, a, bonding, mo, with, symmetry, the, orbital, is, u, because, inversion, through, the, center, of, symmetry, for, would, produce, a, sign, change, the, two, p, atomic, orbitals, are, in, phase, with, each, other, but, the, two, lobes, have, opposite, signs, while, an, antibonding, mo, with, symmetry, is, g, because, inversion, through, the, center, of, symmetry, for, would, not, produce, a, sign, change, the, two, p, orbitals, are, antisymmetric, by, phase, the, qualitative, approach, of, mo, analysis, uses, a, molecular, orbital, diagram, to, visualize, bonding, interactions, in, a, molecule, in, this, type, of, diagram, the, molecular, orbitals, are, represented, by, horizontal, lines, the, higher, a, line, the, higher, the, energy, of, the, orbital, and, degenerate, orbitals, are, placed, on, the, same, level, with, a, space, between, them, then, the, electrons, to, be, placed, in, the, molecular, orbitals, are, slotted, in, one, by, one, keeping, in, mind, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, and, hund, s, rule, of, maximum, multiplicity, only, 2, electrons, having, opposite, spins, per, orbital, place, as, many, unpaired, electrons, on, one, energy, level, as, possible, before, starting, to, pair, them, for, more, complicated, molecules, the, wave, mechanics, approach, loses, utility, in, a, qualitative, understanding, of, bonding, although, is, still, necessary, for, a, quantitative, approach, some, properties, the, general, procedure, for, constructing, a, molecular, orbital, diagram, for, a, reasonably, simple, molecule, can, be, summarized, as, follows, 1, assign, a, point, group, to, the, molecule, 2, look, up, the, shapes, of, the, salcs, 3, arrange, the, salcs, of, each, molecular, fragment, in, order, of, energy, noting, first, whether, they, stem, from, s, p, or, d, orbitals, and, put, them, in, the, order, s, p, d, and, then, their, number, of, internuclear, nodes, 4, combine, salcs, of, the, same, symmetry, type, from, the, two, fragments, and, from, n, salcs, form, n, molecular, orbitals, 5, estimate, the, relative, energies, of, the, molecular, orbitals, from, considerations, of, overlap, and, relative, energies, of, the, parent, orbitals, and, draw, the, levels, on, a, molecular, orbital, energy, level, diagram, showing, the, origin, of, the, orbitals, 6, confirm, correct, and, revise, this, qualitative, order, by, carrying, out, a, molecular, orbital, calculation, by, using, commercial, software, molecular, orbitals, are, said, to, be, degenerate, if, they, have, the, same, energy, for, example, in, the, homonuclear, diatomic, molecules, of, the, first, ten, elements, the, molecular, orbitals, derived, from, the, p, x, and, the, p, y, atomic, orbitals, result, in, two, degenerate, bonding, orbitals, of, low, energy, and, two, degenerate, antibonding, orbitals, of, high, energy, in, an, ionic, bond, oppositely, charged, ions, are, bonded, by, electrostatic, attraction, it, is, possible, to, describe, ionic, bonds, with, molecular, orbital, theory, by, treating, them, as, extremely, polar, bonds, their, bonding, orbitals, are, very, close, in, energy, to, the, atomic, orbitals, of, the, anion, they, are, also, very, similar, in, character, to, the, anion, s, atomic, orbitals, which, means, the, electrons, are, completely, shifted, to, the, anion, in, computer, diagrams, the, orbitals, are, centered, on, the, anion, s, core, the, bond, order, or, number, of, bonds, of, a, molecule, can, be, determined, by, combining, the, number, of, electrons, in, bonding, and, antibonding, molecular, orbitals, a, pair, of, electrons, in, a, bonding, orbital, creates, a, bond, whereas, a, pair, of, electrons, in, an, antibonding, orbital, negates, a, bond, for, example, n, 2, with, eight, electrons, in, bonding, orbitals, and, two, electrons, in, antibonding, orbitals, has, a, bond, order, of, three, which, constitutes, a, triple, bond, bond, strength, is, proportional, to, bond, order, a, greater, amount, of, bonding, produces, a, more, stable, bond, and, bond, length, is, inversely, proportional, to, it, a, stronger, bond, is, shorter, there, are, rare, exceptions, to, the, requirement, of, molecule, having, a, positive, bond, order, although, be, 2, has, a, bond, order, of, 0, according, to, mo, analysis, there, is, experimental, evidence, of, a, highly, unstable, be, 2, molecule, having, a, bond, length, of, 245, pm, and, bond, energy, of, 10, kj, mol, the, highest, occupied, molecular, orbital, and, lowest, unoccupied, molecular, orbital, are, often, referred, to, as, the, homo, and, lumo, respectively, the, difference, of, the, energies, of, the, homo, and, lumo, is, called, the, homo, lumo, gap, this, notion, is, often, the, matter, of, confusion, in, literature, and, should, be, considered, with, caution, its, value, is, usually, located, between, the, fundamental, gap, difference, between, ionization, potential, and, electron, affinity, and, the, optical, gap, in, addition, homo, lumo, gap, can, be, related, to, a, bulk, material, band, gap, or, transport, gap, which, is, usually, much, smaller, than, fundamental, gap, homonuclear, diatomic, mos, contain, equal, contributions, from, each, atomic, orbital, in, the, basis, set, this, is, shown, in, the, homonuclear, diatomic, mo, diagrams, for, h, 2, he, 2, and, li, 2, all, of, which, containing, symmetric, orbitals, as, a, simple, mo, example, consider, the, electrons, in, a, hydrogen, molecule, h, 2, see, molecular, orbital, diagram, with, the, two, atoms, labelled, h, and, h, the, lowest, energy, atomic, orbitals, 1s, and, 1s, do, not, transform, according, to, the, symmetries, of, the, molecule, however, the, following, symmetry, adapted, atomic, orbitals, do, the, symmetric, combination, called, a, bonding, orbital, is, lower, in, energy, than, the, basis, orbitals, and, the, antisymmetric, combination, called, an, antibonding, orbital, is, higher, because, the, h, 2, molecule, has, two, electrons, they, can, both, go, in, the, bonding, orbital, making, the, system, lower, in, energy, hence, more, stable, than, two, free, hydrogen, atoms, this, is, called, a, covalent, bond, the, bond, order, is, equal, to, the, number, of, bonding, electrons, minus, the, number, of, antibonding, electrons, divided, by, 2, in, this, example, there, are, 2, electrons, in, the, bonding, orbital, and, none, in, the, antibonding, orbital, the, bond, order, is, 1, and, there, is, a, single, bond, between, the, two, hydrogen, atoms, on, the, other, hand, consider, the, hypothetical, molecule, of, he, 2, with, the, atoms, labeled, he, and, he, as, with, h, 2, the, lowest, energy, atomic, orbitals, are, the, 1s, and, 1s, and, do, not, transform, according, to, the, symmetries, of, the, molecule, while, the, symmetry, adapted, atomic, orbitals, do, the, symmetric, combination, the, bonding, orbital, is, lower, in, energy, than, the, basis, orbitals, and, the, antisymmetric, combination, the, antibonding, orbital, is, higher, unlike, h, 2, with, two, valence, electrons, he, 2, has, four, in, its, neutral, ground, state, two, electrons, fill, the, lower, energy, bonding, orbital, g, 1s, while, the, remaining, two, fill, the, higher, energy, antibonding, orbital, u, 1s, thus, the, resulting, electron, density, around, the, molecule, does, not, support, the, formation, of, a, bond, between, the, two, atoms, without, a, stable, bond, holding, the, atoms, together, the, molecule, would, not, be, expected, to, exist, another, way, of, looking, at, it, is, that, there, are, two, bonding, electrons, and, two, antibonding, electrons, therefore, the, bond, order, is, 0, and, no, bond, exists, the, molecule, has, one, bound, state, supported, by, the, van, der, waals, potential, dilithium, li, 2, is, formed, from, the, overlap, of, the, 1s, and, 2s, atomic, orbitals, the, basis, set, of, two, li, atoms, each, li, atom, contributes, three, electrons, for, bonding, interactions, and, the, six, electrons, fill, the, three, mos, of, lowest, energy, g, 1s, u, 1s, and, g, 2s, using, the, equation, for, bond, order, it, is, found, that, dilithium, has, a, bond, order, of, one, a, single, bond, considering, a, hypothetical, molecule, of, he, 2, since, the, basis, set, of, atomic, orbitals, is, the, same, as, in, the, case, of, h, 2, we, find, that, both, the, bonding, and, antibonding, orbitals, are, filled, so, there, is, no, energy, advantage, to, the, pair, heh, would, have, a, slight, energy, advantage, but, not, as, much, as, h, 2, 2, he, so, the, molecule, is, very, unstable, and, exists, only, briefly, before, decomposing, into, hydrogen, and, helium, in, general, we, find, that, atoms, such, as, he, that, have, full, energy, shells, rarely, bond, with, other, atoms, except, for, short, lived, van, der, waals, complexes, there, are, very, few, noble, gas, compounds, known, while, mos, for, homonuclear, diatomic, molecules, contain, equal, contributions, from, each, interacting, atomic, orbital, mos, for, heteronuclear, diatomics, contain, different, atomic, orbital, contributions, orbital, interactions, to, produce, bonding, or, antibonding, orbitals, in, heteronuclear, diatomics, occur, if, there, is, sufficient, overlap, between, atomic, orbitals, as, determined, by, their, symmetries, and, similarity, in, orbital, energies, in, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, overlap, between, the, h, 1s, and, f, 2s, orbitals, is, allowed, by, symmetry, but, the, difference, in, energy, between, the, two, atomic, orbitals, prevents, them, from, interacting, to, create, a, molecular, orbital, overlap, between, the, h, 1s, and, f, 2p, z, orbitals, is, also, symmetry, allowed, and, these, two, atomic, orbitals, have, a, small, energy, separation, thus, they, interact, leading, to, creation, of, and, mos, and, a, molecule, with, a, bond, order, of, 1, since, hf, is, a, non, centrosymmetric, molecule, the, symmetry, labels, g, and, u, do, not, apply, to, its, molecular, orbitals, to, obtain, quantitative, values, for, the, molecular, energy, levels, one, needs, to, have, molecular, orbitals, that, are, such, that, the, configuration, interaction, ci, expansion, converges, fast, towards, the, full, ci, limit, the, most, common, method, to, obtain, such, functions, is, the, hartree, fock, method, which, expresses, the, molecular, orbitals, as, eigenfunctions, of, the, fock, operator, one, usually, solves, this, problem, by, expanding, the, molecular, orbitals, as, linear, combinations, of, gaussian, functions, centered, on, the, atomic, nuclei, see, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, and, basis, set, chemistry, the, equation, for, the, coefficients, of, these, linear, combinations, is, a, generalized, eigenvalue, equation, known, as, the, roothaan, equations, which, are, in, fact, a, particular, representation, of, the, hartree, fock, equation, there, are, a, number, of, programs, in, which, quantum, chemical, calculations, of, mos, can, be, performed, including, spartan, simple, accounts, often, suggest, that, experimental, molecular, orbital, energies, can, be, obtained, by, the, methods, of, ultra, violet, photoelectron, spectroscopy, for, valence, orbitals, and, x, ray, photoelectron, spectroscopy, for, core, orbitals, this, however, is, incorrect, as, these, experiments, measure, the, ionization, energy, the, difference, in, energy, between, the, molecule, and, one, of, the, ions, resulting, from, the, removal, of, one, electron, ionization, energies, are, linked, approximately, to, orbital, energies, by, koopmans, theorem, while, the, agreement, between, these, two, values, can, be, close, for, some, molecules, it, can, be, very, poor, in, other, cases
