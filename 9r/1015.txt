stiffness, is, the, extent, to, which, an, object, resists, deformation, in, response, to, an, applied, force, the, complementary, concept, is, flexibility, or, pliability, the, more, flexible, an, object, is, the, less, stiff, it, is, the, stiffness, k, displaystyle, k, of, a, body, is, a, measure, of, the, resistance, offered, by, an, elastic, body, to, deformation, for, an, elastic, body, with, a, single, degree, of, freedom, dof, for, example, stretching, or, compression, of, a, rod, the, stiffness, is, defined, as, k, f, displaystyle, k, frac, f, delta, where, stiffness, is, usually, defined, under, quasi, static, conditions, but, sometimes, under, dynamic, loading, in, the, international, system, of, units, stiffness, is, typically, measured, in, newtons, per, meter, n, m, displaystyle, n, m, in, imperial, units, stiffness, is, typically, measured, in, pounds, lbs, per, inch, generally, speaking, deflections, or, motions, of, an, infinitesimal, element, which, is, viewed, as, a, point, in, an, elastic, body, can, occur, along, multiple, dof, maximum, of, six, dof, at, a, point, for, example, a, point, on, a, horizontal, beam, can, undergo, both, a, vertical, displacement, and, a, rotation, relative, to, its, undeformed, axis, when, there, are, m, displaystyle, m, degrees, of, freedom, a, m, m, displaystyle, m, times, m, matrix, must, be, used, to, describe, the, stiffness, at, the, point, the, diagonal, terms, in, the, matrix, are, the, direct, related, stiffnesses, or, simply, stiffnesses, along, the, same, degree, of, freedom, and, the, off, diagonal, terms, are, the, coupling, stiffnesses, between, two, different, degrees, of, freedom, either, at, the, same, or, different, points, or, the, same, degree, of, freedom, at, two, different, points, in, industry, the, term, influence, coefficient, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, coupling, stiffness, it, is, noted, that, for, a, body, with, multiple, dof, the, equation, above, generally, does, not, apply, since, the, applied, force, generates, not, only, the, deflection, along, its, direction, or, degree, of, freedom, but, also, those, along, with, other, directions, for, a, body, with, multiple, dof, to, calculate, a, particular, direct, related, stiffness, the, diagonal, terms, the, corresponding, dof, is, left, free, while, the, remaining, should, be, constrained, under, such, a, condition, the, above, equation, can, obtain, the, direct, related, stiffness, for, the, degree, of, unconstrained, freedom, the, ratios, between, the, reaction, forces, or, moments, and, the, produced, deflection, are, the, coupling, stiffnesses, the, elasticity, tensor, is, a, generalization, that, describes, all, possible, stretch, and, shear, parameters, a, single, spring, may, intentionally, be, designed, to, have, variable, non, linear, stiffness, throughout, its, displacement, the, inverse, of, stiffness, is, flexibility, or, compliance, typically, measured, in, units, of, metres, per, newton, in, rheology, it, may, be, defined, as, the, ratio, of, strain, to, stress, and, so, take, the, units, of, reciprocal, stress, for, example, 1, pa, a, body, may, also, have, a, rotational, stiffness, k, displaystyle, k, given, by, k, m, displaystyle, k, frac, m, theta, where, in, the, si, system, rotational, stiffness, is, typically, measured, in, newton, metres, per, radian, in, the, sae, system, rotational, stiffness, is, typically, measured, in, inch, pounds, per, degree, further, measures, of, stiffness, are, derived, on, a, similar, basis, including, the, elastic, modulus, of, a, material, is, not, the, same, as, the, stiffness, of, a, component, made, from, that, material, elastic, modulus, is, a, property, of, the, constituent, material, stiffness, is, a, property, of, a, structure, or, component, of, a, structure, and, hence, it, is, dependent, upon, various, physical, dimensions, that, describe, that, component, that, is, the, modulus, is, an, intensive, property, of, the, material, stiffness, on, the, other, hand, is, an, extensive, property, of, the, solid, body, that, is, dependent, on, the, material, and, its, shape, and, boundary, conditions, for, example, for, an, element, in, tension, or, compression, the, axial, stiffness, is, k, e, a, l, displaystyle, k, e, cdot, frac, a, l, where, similarly, the, torsional, stiffness, of, a, straight, section, is, k, g, j, l, displaystyle, k, g, cdot, frac, j, l, where, note, that, the, torsional, stiffness, has, dimensions, so, that, its, si, units, are, n, m, rad, for, the, special, case, of, unconstrained, uniaxial, tension, or, compression, young, s, modulus, can, be, thought, of, as, a, measure, of, the, stiffness, of, a, structure, the, stiffness, of, a, structure, is, of, principal, importance, in, many, engineering, applications, so, the, modulus, of, elasticity, is, often, one, of, the, primary, properties, considered, when, selecting, a, material, a, high, modulus, of, elasticity, is, sought, when, deflection, is, undesirable, while, a, low, modulus, of, elasticity, is, required, when, flexibility, is, needed, in, biology, the, stiffness, of, the, extracellular, matrix, is, important, for, guiding, the, migration, of, cells, in, a, phenomenon, called, durotaxis, another, application, of, stiffness, finds, itself, in, skin, biology, the, skin, maintains, its, structure, due, to, its, intrinsic, tension, contributed, to, by, collagen, an, extracellular, protein, that, accounts, for, approximately, 75, of, its, dry, weight, the, pliability, of, skin, is, a, parameter, of, interest, that, represents, its, firmness, and, extensibility, encompassing, characteristics, such, as, elasticity, stiffness, and, adherence, these, factors, are, of, functional, significance, to, patients, this, is, of, significance, to, patients, with, traumatic, injuries, to, the, skin, whereby, the, pliability, can, be, reduced, due, to, the, formation, and, replacement, of, healthy, skin, tissue, by, a, pathological, scar, this, can, be, evaluated, both, subjectively, or, objectively, using, a, device, such, as, the, cutometer, the, cutometer, applies, a, vacuum, to, the, skin, and, measures, the, extent, to, which, it, can, be, vertically, distended, these, measurements, are, able, to, distinguish, between, healthy, skin, normal, scarring, and, pathological, scarring, and, the, method, has, been, applied, within, clinical, and, industrial, settings, to, monitor, both, pathophysiological, sequelae, and, the, effects, of, treatments, on, skin
