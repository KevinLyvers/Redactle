legend, the, alkaline, earth, metals, are, six, chemical, elements, in, group, 2, of, the, periodic, table, they, are, beryllium, be, magnesium, mg, calcium, ca, strontium, sr, barium, ba, and, radium, ra, the, elements, have, very, similar, properties, they, are, all, shiny, silvery, white, somewhat, reactive, metals, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, together, with, helium, these, elements, have, in, common, an, outer, s, orbital, which, is, full, that, is, this, orbital, contains, its, full, complement, of, two, electrons, which, the, alkaline, earth, metals, readily, lose, to, form, cations, with, charge, 2, and, an, oxidation, state, of, 2, helium, is, grouped, with, the, noble, gases, and, not, with, the, alkaline, earth, metals, but, it, is, theorized, to, have, some, similarities, to, beryllium, when, forced, into, bonding, and, has, sometimes, been, suggested, to, belong, to, group, 2, all, the, discovered, alkaline, earth, metals, occur, in, nature, although, radium, occurs, only, through, the, decay, chain, of, uranium, and, thorium, and, not, as, a, primordial, element, there, have, been, experiments, all, unsuccessful, to, try, to, synthesize, element, 120, the, next, potential, member, of, the, group, as, with, other, groups, the, members, of, this, family, show, patterns, in, their, electronic, configuration, especially, the, outermost, shells, resulting, in, trends, in, chemical, behavior, most, of, the, chemistry, has, been, observed, only, for, the, first, five, members, of, the, group, the, chemistry, of, radium, is, not, well, established, due, to, its, radioactivity, thus, the, presentation, of, its, properties, here, is, limited, the, alkaline, earth, metals, are, all, silver, colored, and, soft, and, have, relatively, low, densities, melting, points, and, boiling, points, in, chemical, terms, all, of, the, alkaline, earth, metals, react, with, the, halogens, to, form, the, alkaline, earth, metal, halides, all, of, which, are, ionic, crystalline, compounds, except, for, beryllium, chloride, beryllium, bromide, and, beryllium, iodide, which, are, covalent, all, the, alkaline, earth, metals, except, beryllium, also, react, with, water, to, form, strongly, alkaline, hydroxides, and, thus, should, be, handled, with, great, care, the, heavier, alkaline, earth, metals, react, more, vigorously, than, the, lighter, ones, the, alkaline, earth, metals, have, the, second, lowest, first, ionization, energies, in, their, respective, periods, of, the, periodic, table, because, of, their, somewhat, low, effective, nuclear, charges, and, the, ability, to, attain, a, full, outer, shell, configuration, by, losing, just, two, electrons, the, second, ionization, energy, of, all, of, the, alkaline, metals, is, also, somewhat, low, beryllium, is, an, exception, it, does, not, react, with, water, or, steam, unless, at, very, high, temperatures, and, its, halides, are, covalent, if, beryllium, did, form, compounds, with, an, ionization, state, of, 2, it, would, polarize, electron, clouds, that, are, near, it, very, strongly, and, would, cause, extensive, orbital, overlap, since, beryllium, has, a, high, charge, density, all, compounds, that, include, beryllium, have, a, covalent, bond, even, the, compound, beryllium, fluoride, which, is, the, most, ionic, beryllium, compound, has, a, low, melting, point, and, a, low, electrical, conductivity, when, melted, all, the, alkaline, earth, metals, have, two, electrons, in, their, valence, shell, so, the, energetically, preferred, state, of, achieving, a, filled, electron, shell, is, to, lose, two, electrons, to, form, doubly, charged, positive, ions, the, alkaline, earth, metals, all, react, with, the, halogens, to, form, ionic, halides, such, as, calcium, chloride, cacl, 2, as, well, as, reacting, with, oxygen, to, form, oxides, such, as, strontium, oxide, sro, calcium, strontium, and, barium, react, with, water, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, and, their, respective, hydroxides, magnesium, also, reacts, but, much, more, slowly, and, also, undergo, transmetalation, reactions, to, exchange, ligands, isotopes, of, all, six, alkaline, earth, metals, are, present, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, the, solar, system, at, varying, concentrations, dependent, upon, the, nuclides, half, lives, and, hence, their, nuclear, stabilities, the, first, five, have, one, three, five, four, and, six, stable, or, observationally, stable, isotopes, respectively, for, a, total, of, 19, stable, nuclides, as, listed, here, beryllium, 9, magnesium, 24, 25, 26, calcium, 40, 42, 43, 44, 46, strontium, 84, 86, 87, 88, barium, 132, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, the, four, underlined, isotopes, in, the, list, are, predicted, by, radionuclide, decay, energetics, to, be, only, observationally, stable, and, to, decay, with, extremely, long, half, lives, through, double, beta, decay, though, no, decays, attributed, definitively, to, these, isotopes, have, yet, been, observed, as, of, 2024, radium, has, no, stable, nor, primordial, isotopes, in, addition, to, the, stable, species, calcium, and, barium, each, have, one, extremely, long, lived, and, primordial, radionuclide, calcium, 48, and, barium, 130, with, half, lives, of, 5, 6, 10, 19, and, 1, 6, 10, 21, years, respectively, both, are, far, longer, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, 4, 7, and, 117, billion, times, longer, respectively, and, less, than, one, part, per, ten, billion, has, decayed, since, the, formation, of, the, earth, the, two, isotopes, are, stable, for, practical, purposes, apart, from, the, 21, stable, or, nearly, stable, isotopes, the, six, alkaline, earth, elements, each, possess, a, large, number, of, known, radioisotopes, none, of, the, isotopes, other, than, the, aforementioned, 21, are, primordial, all, have, half, lives, too, short, for, even, a, single, atom, to, have, survived, since, the, solar, system, s, formation, after, the, seeding, of, heavy, nuclei, by, nearby, supernovae, and, collisions, between, neutron, stars, and, any, present, are, derived, from, ongoing, natural, processes, beryllium, 7, beryllium, 10, and, calcium, 41, are, trace, as, well, as, cosmogenic, nuclides, formed, by, the, impact, of, cosmic, rays, with, atmospheric, or, crustal, atoms, the, longest, half, lives, among, them, are, 1, 387, million, years, for, beryllium, 10, 99, 4, thousand, years, for, calcium, 41, 1599, years, for, radium, 226, radium, s, longest, lived, isotope, 28, 90, years, for, strontium, 90, 10, 51, years, for, barium, 133, and, 5, 75, years, for, radium, 228, all, others, have, half, lives, of, less, than, half, a, year, most, significantly, shorter, calcium, 48, and, barium, 130, the, two, primordial, and, non, stable, isotopes, decay, only, through, double, beta, emission, and, have, extremely, long, half, lives, by, virtue, of, the, extremely, low, probability, of, both, beta, decays, occurring, at, the, same, time, all, isotopes, of, radium, are, highly, radioactive, and, are, primarily, generated, through, the, decay, of, heavier, radionuclides, the, longest, lived, of, them, is, radium, 226, a, member, of, the, decay, chain, of, uranium, 238, strontium, 90, and, barium, 140, are, common, fission, products, of, uranium, in, nuclear, reactors, accounting, for, 5, 73, and, 6, 31, of, uranium, 235, s, fission, products, respectively, when, bombarded, by, thermal, neutrons, the, two, isotopes, have, half, lives, each, of, 28, 90, years, and, 12, 7, days, strontium, 90, is, produced, in, appreciable, quantities, in, operating, nuclear, reactors, running, on, uranium, 235, or, plutonium, 239, fuel, and, a, minuscule, secular, equilibrium, concentration, is, also, present, due, to, rare, spontaneous, fission, decays, in, naturally, occurring, uranium, calcium, 48, is, the, lightest, nuclide, known, to, undergo, double, beta, decay, naturally, occurring, calcium, and, barium, are, very, weakly, radioactive, calcium, contains, about, 0, 1874, calcium, 48, and, barium, contains, about, 0, 1062, barium, 130, on, average, one, double, beta, decay, of, calcium, 48, will, occur, per, second, for, every, 90, tons, of, natural, calcium, or, 230, tons, of, limestone, calcium, carbonate, through, the, same, decay, mechanism, one, decay, of, barium, 130, will, occur, per, second, for, every, 16, 000, tons, of, natural, barium, or, 27, 000, tons, of, baryte, barium, sulfate, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, radium, is, radium, 226, with, a, half, life, of, 1600, years, it, along, with, radium, 223, 224, and, 228, occur, naturally, in, the, decay, chains, of, primordial, thorium, and, uranium, beryllium, 8, is, notable, by, its, absence, as, it, splits, in, half, virtually, instantaneously, into, two, alpha, particles, whenever, it, is, formed, the, triple, alpha, process, in, stars, can, only, occur, at, energies, high, enough, for, beryllium, 8, to, fuse, with, a, third, alpha, particle, before, it, can, decay, forming, carbon, 12, this, thermonuclear, rate, limiting, bottleneck, is, the, reason, most, main, sequence, stars, spend, billions, of, years, fusing, hydrogen, within, their, cores, and, only, rarely, manage, to, fuse, carbon, before, collapsing, into, a, stellar, remnant, and, even, then, merely, for, a, timescale, of, 1000, years, the, radioisotopes, of, alkaline, earth, metals, tend, to, be, bone, seekers, as, they, behave, chemically, similar, to, calcium, an, integral, component, of, hydroxyapatite, in, compact, bone, and, gradually, accumulate, in, the, human, skeleton, the, incorporated, radionuclides, inflict, significant, damage, to, the, bone, marrow, over, time, through, the, emission, of, ionizing, radiation, primarily, alpha, particles, this, property, is, made, use, of, in, a, positive, manner, in, the, radiotherapy, of, certain, bone, cancers, since, the, radionuclides, chemical, properties, causes, them, to, preferentially, target, cancerous, growths, in, bone, matter, leaving, the, rest, of, the, body, relatively, unharmed, compared, to, their, neighbors, in, the, periodic, table, alkaline, earth, metals, tend, to, have, a, larger, number, of, stable, isotopes, as, they, all, possess, an, even, number, of, protons, owing, to, their, status, as, group, 2, elements, their, isotopes, are, generally, more, stable, due, to, nucleon, pairing, this, stability, is, further, enhanced, if, the, isotope, also, has, an, even, number, of, neutrons, as, both, kinds, of, nucleons, can, then, participate, in, pairing, and, contribute, to, nuclei, stability, the, alkaline, earth, metals, are, named, after, their, oxides, the, alkaline, earths, whose, old, fashioned, names, were, beryllia, magnesia, lime, strontia, and, baria, these, oxides, are, basic, alkaline, when, combined, with, water, earth, was, a, term, applied, by, early, chemists, to, nonmetallic, substances, that, are, insoluble, in, water, and, resistant, to, heating, properties, shared, by, these, oxides, the, realization, that, these, earths, were, not, elements, but, compounds, is, attributed, to, the, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, in, his, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, elements, of, chemistry, of, 1789, he, called, them, salt, forming, earth, elements, later, he, suggested, that, the, alkaline, earths, might, be, metal, oxides, but, admitted, that, this, was, mere, conjecture, in, 1808, acting, on, lavoisier, s, idea, humphry, davy, became, the, first, to, obtain, samples, of, the, metals, by, electrolysis, of, their, molten, earths, thus, supporting, lavoisier, s, hypothesis, and, causing, the, group, to, be, named, the, alkaline, earth, metals, the, calcium, compounds, calcite, and, lime, have, been, known, and, used, since, prehistoric, times, the, same, is, true, for, the, beryllium, compounds, beryl, and, emerald, the, other, compounds, of, the, alkaline, earth, metals, were, discovered, starting, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, magnesium, compound, magnesium, sulfate, was, first, discovered, in, 1618, by, a, farmer, at, epsom, in, england, strontium, carbonate, was, discovered, in, minerals, in, the, scottish, village, of, strontian, in, 1790, the, last, element, is, the, least, abundant, radioactive, radium, which, was, extracted, from, uraninite, in, 1898, all, elements, except, beryllium, were, isolated, by, electrolysis, of, molten, compounds, magnesium, calcium, and, strontium, were, first, produced, by, humphry, davy, in, 1808, whereas, beryllium, was, independently, isolated, by, friedrich, w, hler, and, antoine, bussy, in, 1828, by, reacting, beryllium, compounds, with, potassium, in, 1910, radium, was, isolated, as, a, pure, metal, by, curie, and, andr, louis, debierne, also, by, electrolysis, beryl, a, mineral, that, contains, beryllium, has, been, known, since, the, time, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, in, egypt, although, it, was, originally, thought, that, beryl, was, an, aluminum, silicate, beryl, was, later, found, to, contain, a, then, unknown, element, when, in, 1797, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, dissolved, aluminum, hydroxide, from, beryl, in, an, alkali, in, 1828, friedrich, w, hler, and, antoine, bussy, independently, isolated, this, new, element, beryllium, by, the, same, method, which, involved, a, reaction, of, beryllium, chloride, with, metallic, potassium, this, reaction, was, not, able, to, produce, large, ingots, of, beryllium, it, was, not, until, 1898, when, paul, lebeau, performed, an, electrolysis, of, a, mixture, of, beryllium, fluoride, and, sodium, fluoride, that, large, pure, samples, of, beryllium, were, produced, magnesium, was, first, produced, by, humphry, davy, in, england, in, 1808, using, electrolysis, of, a, mixture, of, magnesia, and, mercuric, oxide, antoine, bussy, prepared, it, in, coherent, form, in, 1831, davy, s, first, suggestion, for, a, name, was, magnium, but, the, name, magnesium, is, now, used, lime, has, been, used, as, a, material, for, building, since, 7000, to, 14, 000, bce, and, kilns, used, for, lime, have, been, dated, to, 2, 500, bce, in, khafaja, mesopotamia, calcium, as, a, material, has, been, known, since, at, least, the, first, century, as, the, ancient, romans, were, known, to, have, used, calcium, oxide, by, preparing, it, from, lime, calcium, sulfate, has, been, known, to, be, able, to, set, broken, bones, since, the, tenth, century, calcium, itself, however, was, not, isolated, until, 1808, when, humphry, davy, in, england, used, electrolysis, on, a, mixture, of, lime, and, mercuric, oxide, after, hearing, that, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, had, prepared, a, calcium, amalgam, from, the, electrolysis, of, lime, in, mercury, in, 1790, physician, adair, crawford, discovered, ores, with, distinctive, properties, which, were, named, strontites, in, 1793, by, thomas, charles, hope, a, chemistry, professor, at, the, university, of, glasgow, who, confirmed, crawford, s, discovery, strontium, was, eventually, isolated, in, 1808, by, humphry, davy, by, electrolysis, of, a, mixture, of, strontium, chloride, and, mercuric, oxide, the, discovery, was, announced, by, davy, on, 30, june, 1808, at, a, lecture, to, the, royal, society, barite, a, mineral, containing, barium, was, first, recognized, as, containing, a, new, element, in, 1774, by, carl, scheele, although, he, was, able, to, isolate, only, barium, oxide, barium, oxide, was, isolated, again, two, years, later, by, johan, gottlieb, gahn, later, in, the, 18th, century, william, withering, noticed, a, heavy, mineral, in, the, cumberland, lead, mines, which, are, now, known, to, contain, barium, barium, itself, was, finally, isolated, in, 1808, when, humphry, davy, used, electrolysis, with, molten, salts, and, davy, named, the, element, barium, after, baryta, later, robert, bunsen, and, augustus, matthiessen, isolated, pure, barium, by, electrolysis, of, a, mixture, of, barium, chloride, and, ammonium, chloride, while, studying, uraninite, on, 21, december, 1898, marie, and, pierre, curie, discovered, that, even, after, uranium, had, decayed, the, material, created, was, still, radioactive, the, material, behaved, somewhat, similarly, to, barium, compounds, although, some, properties, such, as, the, color, of, the, flame, test, and, spectral, lines, were, much, different, they, announced, the, discovery, of, a, new, element, on, 26, december, 1898, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, radium, was, named, in, 1899, from, the, word, radius, meaning, ray, as, radium, emitted, power, in, the, form, of, rays, beryllium, occurs, in, the, earth, s, crust, at, a, concentration, of, two, to, six, parts, per, million, ppm, much, of, which, is, in, soils, where, it, has, a, concentration, of, six, ppm, beryllium, is, one, of, the, rarest, elements, in, seawater, even, rarer, than, elements, such, as, scandium, with, a, concentration, of, 0, 2, parts, per, trillion, however, in, freshwater, beryllium, is, somewhat, more, common, with, a, concentration, of, 0, 1, parts, per, billion, magnesium, and, calcium, are, very, common, in, the, earth, s, crust, being, respectively, the, fifth, and, eighth, most, abundant, elements, none, of, the, alkaline, earth, metals, are, found, in, their, elemental, state, common, magnesium, containing, minerals, are, carnallite, magnesite, and, dolomite, common, calcium, containing, minerals, are, chalk, limestone, gypsum, and, anhydrite, strontium, is, the, 15th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, the, principal, minerals, are, celestite, and, strontianite, barium, is, slightly, less, common, much, of, it, in, the, mineral, barite, radium, being, a, decay, product, of, uranium, is, found, in, all, uranium, bearing, ores, due, to, its, relatively, short, half, life, radium, from, the, earth, s, early, history, has, decayed, and, present, day, samples, have, all, come, from, the, much, slower, decay, of, uranium, most, beryllium, is, extracted, from, beryllium, hydroxide, one, production, method, is, sintering, done, by, mixing, beryl, sodium, fluorosilicate, and, soda, at, high, temperatures, to, form, sodium, fluoroberyllate, aluminum, oxide, and, silicon, dioxide, a, solution, of, sodium, fluoroberyllate, and, sodium, hydroxide, in, water, is, then, used, to, form, beryllium, hydroxide, by, precipitation, alternatively, in, the, melt, method, powdered, beryl, is, heated, to, high, temperature, cooled, with, water, then, heated, again, slightly, in, sulfuric, acid, eventually, yielding, beryllium, hydroxide, the, beryllium, hydroxide, from, either, method, then, produces, beryllium, fluoride, and, beryllium, chloride, through, a, somewhat, long, process, electrolysis, or, heating, of, these, compounds, can, then, produce, beryllium, in, general, strontium, carbonate, is, extracted, from, the, mineral, celestite, through, two, methods, by, leaching, the, celestite, with, sodium, carbonate, or, in, a, more, complicated, way, involving, coal, to, produce, barium, barite, impure, barium, sulfate, is, converted, to, barium, sulfide, by, carbothermic, reduction, such, as, with, coke, the, sulfide, is, water, soluble, and, easily, reacted, to, form, pure, barium, sulfate, used, for, commercial, pigments, or, other, compounds, such, as, barium, nitrate, these, in, turn, are, calcined, into, barium, oxide, which, eventually, yields, pure, barium, after, reduction, with, aluminum, the, most, important, supplier, of, barium, is, china, which, produces, more, than, 50, of, world, supply, beryllium, is, used, mainly, in, military, applications, but, non, military, uses, exist, in, electronics, beryllium, is, used, as, a, p, type, dopant, in, some, semiconductors, and, beryllium, oxide, is, used, as, a, high, strength, electrical, insulator, and, heat, conductor, beryllium, alloys, are, used, for, mechanical, parts, when, stiffness, light, weight, and, dimensional, stability, are, required, over, a, wide, temperature, range, beryllium, 9, is, used, in, small, scale, neutron, sources, that, use, the, reaction, 9, be, 4, he, 12, c, 1, n, the, reaction, used, by, james, chadwick, when, he, discovered, the, neutron, its, low, atomic, weight, and, low, neutron, absorption, cross, section, would, make, beryllium, suitable, as, a, neutron, moderator, but, its, high, price, and, the, readily, available, alternatives, such, as, water, heavy, water, and, nuclear, graphite, have, limited, this, to, niche, applications, in, the, flibe, eutectic, used, in, molten, salt, reactors, beryllium, s, role, as, a, moderator, is, more, incidental, than, the, desired, property, leading, to, its, use, magnesium, has, many, uses, it, offers, advantages, over, other, structural, materials, such, as, aluminum, but, magnesium, s, usage, is, hindered, by, its, flammability, magnesium, is, often, alloyed, with, aluminum, zinc, and, manganese, to, increase, its, strength, and, corrosion, resistance, magnesium, has, many, other, industrial, applications, such, as, its, role, in, the, production, of, iron, and, steel, and, in, the, kroll, process, for, production, of, titanium, calcium, is, used, as, a, reducing, agent, in, the, separation, of, other, metals, such, as, uranium, from, ore, it, is, a, major, component, of, many, alloys, especially, aluminum, and, copper, alloys, and, is, also, used, to, deoxidize, alloys, calcium, has, roles, in, the, making, of, cheese, mortars, and, cement, strontium, and, barium, have, fewer, applications, than, the, lighter, alkaline, earth, metals, strontium, carbonate, is, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, red, fireworks, pure, strontium, is, used, in, the, study, of, neurotransmitter, release, in, neurons, radioactive, strontium, 90, finds, some, use, in, rtgs, which, utilize, its, decay, heat, barium, is, used, in, vacuum, tubes, as, a, getter, to, remove, gases, barium, sulfate, has, many, uses, in, the, petroleum, industry, and, other, industries, radium, has, many, former, applications, based, on, its, radioactivity, but, its, use, is, no, longer, common, because, of, the, adverse, health, effects, and, long, half, life, radium, was, frequently, used, in, luminous, paints, although, this, use, was, stopped, after, it, sickened, workers, the, nuclear, quackery, that, alleged, health, benefits, of, radium, formerly, led, to, its, addition, to, drinking, water, toothpaste, and, many, other, products, radium, is, no, longer, used, even, when, its, radioactive, properties, are, desired, because, its, long, half, life, makes, safe, disposal, challenging, for, example, in, brachytherapy, short, half, life, alternatives, such, as, iridium, 192, are, usually, used, instead, reaction, with, halogens, anhydrous, calcium, chloride, is, a, hygroscopic, substance, that, is, used, as, a, desiccant, exposed, to, air, it, will, absorb, water, vapour, from, the, air, forming, a, solution, this, property, is, known, as, deliquescence, reaction, with, oxygen, reaction, with,

softening, the, water, this, procedure, can, be, done, using, reagents, such, as, calcium, hydroxide, sodium, carbonate, or, sodium, phosphate, a, more, common, method, is, to, use, ion, exchange, aluminosilicates, or, ion, exchange, resins, that, trap, ca, 2, and, mg, 2, and, liberate, na, instead, magnesium, and, calcium, are, ubiquitous, and, essential, to, all, known, living, organisms, they, are, involved, in, more, than, one, role, with, for, example, magnesium, or, calcium, ion, pumps, playing, a, role, in, some, cellular, processes, magnesium, functioning, as, the, active, center, in, some, enzymes, and, calcium, salts, taking, a, structural, role, most, notably, in, bones, strontium, plays, an, important, role, in, marine, aquatic, life, especially, hard, corals, which, use, strontium, to, build, their, exoskeletons, it, and, barium, have, some, uses, in, medicine, for, example, barium, meals, in, radiographic, imaging, whilst, strontium, compounds, are, employed, in, some, toothpastes, excessive, amounts, of, strontium, 90, are, toxic, due, to, its, radioactivity, and, strontium, 90, mimics, calcium, i, e, behaves, as, a, bone, seeker, where, it, bio, accumulates, with, a, significant, biological, half, life, while, the, bones, themselves, have, higher, radiation, tolerance, than, other, tissues, the, rapidly, dividing, bone, marrow, does, not, and, can, thus, be, significantly, harmed, by, sr, 90, the, effect, of, ionizing, radiation, on, bone, marrow, is, also, the, reason, why, acute, radiation, syndrome, can, have, anemia, like, symptoms, and, why, donation, of, red, blood, cells, can, increase, survivability, beryllium, and, radium, however, are, toxic, beryllium, s, low, aqueous, solubility, means, it, is, rarely, available, to, biological, systems, it, has, no, known, role, in, living, organisms, and, when, encountered, by, them, is, usually, highly, toxic, radium, has, a, low, availability, and, is, highly, radioactive, making, it, toxic, to, life, the, next, alkaline, earth, metal, after, radium, is, thought, to, be, element, 120, although, this, may, not, be, true, due, to, relativistic, effects, the, synthesis, of, element, 120, was, first, attempted, in, march, 2007, when, a, team, at, the, flerov, laboratory, of, nuclear, reactions, in, dubna, bombarded, plutonium, 244, with, iron, 58, ions, however, no, atoms, were, produced, leading, to, a, limit, of, 400, fb, for, the, cross, section, at, the, energy, studied, in, april, 2007, a, team, at, the, gsi, attempted, to, create, element, 120, by, bombarding, uranium, 238, with, nickel, 64, although, no, atoms, were, detected, leading, to, a, limit, of, 1, 6, pb, for, the, reaction, synthesis, was, again, attempted, at, higher, sensitivities, although, no, atoms, were, detected, other, reactions, have, been, tried, although, all, have, been, met, with, failure, the, chemistry, of, element, 120, is, predicted, to, be, closer, to, that, of, calcium, or, strontium, instead, of, barium, or, radium, this, noticeably, contrasts, with, periodic, trends, which, would, predict, element, 120, to, be, more, reactive, than, barium, and, radium, this, lowered, reactivity, is, due, to, the, expected, energies, of, element, 120, s, valence, electrons, increasing, element, 120, s, ionization, energy, and, decreasing, the, metallic, and, ionic, radii, the, next, alkaline, earth, metal, after, element, 120, has, not, been, definitely, predicted, although, a, simple, extrapolation, using, the, aufbau, principle, would, suggest, that, element, 170, is, a, congener, of, 120, relativistic, effects, may, render, such, an, extrapolation, invalid, the, next, element, with, properties, similar, to, the, alkaline, earth, metals, has, been, predicted, to, be, element, 166, though, due, to, overlapping, orbitals, and, lower, energy, gap, below, the, 9s, subshell, element, 166, may, instead, be, placed, in, group, 12, below,
