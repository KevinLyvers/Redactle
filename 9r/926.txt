maxwell, s, equations, or, maxwell, heaviside, equations, are, a, set, of, coupled, partial, differential, equations, that, together, with, the, lorentz, force, law, form, the, foundation, of, classical, electromagnetism, classical, optics, electric, and, magnetic, circuits, the, equations, provide, a, mathematical, model, for, electric, optical, and, radio, technologies, such, as, power, generation, electric, motors, wireless, communication, lenses, radar, etc, they, describe, how, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, generated, by, charges, currents, and, changes, of, the, fields, the, equations, are, named, after, the, physicist, and, mathematician, james, clerk, maxwell, who, in, 1861, and, 1862, published, an, early, form, of, the, equations, that, included, the, lorentz, force, law, maxwell, first, used, the, equations, to, propose, that, light, is, an, electromagnetic, phenomenon, the, modern, form, of, the, equations, in, their, most, common, formulation, is, credited, to, oliver, heaviside, maxwell, s, equations, may, be, combined, to, demonstrate, how, fluctuations, in, electromagnetic, fields, waves, propagate, at, a, constant, speed, in, vacuum, c, 299, 792, 458, m, s, known, as, electromagnetic, radiation, these, waves, occur, at, various, wavelengths, to, produce, a, spectrum, of, radiation, from, radio, waves, to, gamma, rays, in, partial, differential, equation, form, and, si, units, maxwell, s, microscopic, equations, can, be, written, as, e, 0, b, 0, e, b, t, b, 0, j, 0, e, t, displaystyle, begin, aligned, nabla, cdot, mathbf, e, frac, rho, varepsilon, 0, nabla, cdot, mathbf, b, 0, nabla, times, mathbf, e, frac, partial, mathbf, b, partial, t, nabla, times, mathbf, b, mu, 0, left, mathbf, j, varepsilon, 0, frac, partial, mathbf, e, partial, t, right, end, aligned, with, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, the, electric, field, b, displaystyle, mathbf, b, the, magnetic, field, displaystyle, rho, the, electric, charge, density, and, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, the, current, density, 0, displaystyle, varepsilon, 0, is, the, vacuum, permittivity, and, 0, displaystyle, mu, 0, the, vacuum, permeability, the, equations, have, two, major, variants, the, term, maxwell, s, equations, is, often, also, used, for, equivalent, alternative, formulations, versions, of, maxwell, s, equations, based, on, the, electric, and, magnetic, scalar, potentials, are, preferred, for, explicitly, solving, the, equations, as, a, boundary, value, problem, analytical, mechanics, or, for, use, in, quantum, mechanics, the, covariant, formulation, on, spacetime, rather, than, space, and, time, separately, makes, the, compatibility, of, maxwell, s, equations, with, special, relativity, manifest, maxwell, s, equations, in, curved, spacetime, commonly, used, in, high, energy, and, gravitational, physics, are, compatible, with, general, relativity, in, fact, albert, einstein, developed, special, and, general, relativity, to, accommodate, the, invariant, speed, of, light, a, consequence, of, maxwell, s, equations, with, the, principle, that, only, relative, movement, has, physical, consequences, the, publication, of, the, equations, marked, the, unification, of, a, theory, for, previously, separately, described, phenomena, magnetism, electricity, light, and, associated, radiation, since, the, mid, 20th, century, it, has, been, understood, that, maxwell, s, equations, do, not, give, an, exact, description, of, electromagnetic, phenomena, but, are, instead, a, classical, limit, of, the, more, precise, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, gauss, s, law, describes, the, relationship, between, an, electric, field, and, electric, charges, an, electric, field, points, away, from, positive, charges, and, towards, negative, charges, and, the, net, outflow, of, the, electric, field, through, a, closed, surface, is, proportional, to, the, enclosed, charge, including, bound, charge, due, to, polarization, of, material, the, coefficient, of, the, proportion, is, the, permittivity, of, free, space, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, states, that, electric, charges, have, no, magnetic, analogues, called, magnetic, monopoles, no, north, or, south, magnetic, poles, exist, in, isolation, instead, the, magnetic, field, of, a, material, is, attributed, to, a, dipole, and, the, net, outflow, of, the, magnetic, field, through, a, closed, surface, is, zero, magnetic, dipoles, may, be, represented, as, loops, of, current, or, inseparable, pairs, of, equal, and, opposite, magnetic, charges, precisely, the, total, magnetic, flux, through, a, gaussian, surface, is, zero, and, the, magnetic, field, is, a, solenoidal, vector, field, the, maxwell, faraday, version, of, faraday, s, law, of, induction, describes, how, a, time, varying, magnetic, field, corresponds, to, curl, of, an, electric, field, in, integral, form, it, states, that, the, work, per, unit, charge, required, to, move, a, charge, around, a, closed, loop, equals, the, rate, of, change, of, the, magnetic, flux, through, the, enclosed, surface, the, electromagnetic, induction, is, the, operating, principle, behind, many, electric, generators, for, example, a, rotating, bar, magnet, creates, a, changing, magnetic, field, and, generates, an, electric, field, in, a, nearby, wire, the, original, law, of, amp, re, states, that, magnetic, fields, relate, to, electric, current, maxwell, s, addition, states, that, magnetic, fields, also, relate, to, changing, electric, fields, which, maxwell, called, displacement, current, the, integral, form, states, that, electric, and, displacement, currents, are, associated, with, a, proportional, magnetic, field, along, any, enclosing, curve, maxwell, s, modification, of, amp, re, s, circuital, law, is, important, because, the, laws, of, amp, re, and, gauss, must, otherwise, be, adjusted, for, static, fields, as, a, consequence, it, predicts, that, a, rotating, magnetic, field, occurs, with, a, changing, electric, field, a, further, consequence, is, the, existence, of, self, sustaining, electromagnetic, waves, which, travel, through, empty, space, the, speed, calculated, for, electromagnetic, waves, which, could, be, predicted, from, experiments, on, charges, and, currents, matches, the, speed, of, light, indeed, light, is, one, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, as, are, x, rays, radio, waves, and, others, maxwell, understood, the, connection, between, electromagnetic, waves, and, light, in, 1861, thereby, unifying, the, theories, of, electromagnetism, and, optics, in, the, electric, and, magnetic, field, formulation, there, are, four, equations, that, determine, the, fields, for, given, charge, and, current, distribution, a, separate, law, of, nature, the, lorentz, force, law, describes, how, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, act, on, charged, particles, and, currents, by, convention, a, version, of, this, law, in, the, original, equations, by, maxwell, is, no, longer, included, the, vector, calculus, formalism, below, the, work, of, oliver, heaviside, has, become, standard, it, is, rotationally, invariant, and, therefore, mathematically, more, transparent, than, maxwell, s, original, 20, equations, in, x, y, and, z, components, the, relativistic, formulations, are, more, symmetric, and, lorentz, invariant, for, the, same, equations, expressed, using, tensor, calculus, or, differential, forms, see, alternative, formulations, the, differential, and, integral, formulations, are, mathematically, equivalent, both, are, useful, the, integral, formulation, relates, fields, within, a, region, of, space, to, fields, on, the, boundary, and, can, often, be, used, to, simplify, and, directly, calculate, fields, from, symmetric, distributions, of, charges, and, currents, on, the, other, hand, the, differential, equations, are, purely, local, and, are, a, more, natural, starting, point, for, calculating, the, fields, in, more, complicated, less, symmetric, situations, for, example, using, finite, element, analysis, symbols, in, bold, represent, vector, quantities, and, symbols, in, italics, represent, scalar, quantities, unless, otherwise, indicated, the, equations, introduce, the, electric, field, e, a, vector, field, and, the, magnetic, field, b, a, pseudovector, field, each, generally, having, a, time, and, location, dependence, the, sources, are, the, universal, constants, appearing, in, the, equations, the, first, two, ones, explicitly, only, in, the, si, formulation, are, in, the, differential, equations, in, the, integral, equations, the, equations, are, a, little, easier, to, interpret, with, time, independent, surfaces, and, volumes, time, independent, surfaces, and, volumes, are, fixed, and, do, not, change, over, a, given, time, interval, for, example, since, the, surface, is, time, independent, we, can, bring, the, differentiation, under, the, integral, sign, in, faraday, s, law, d, d, t, b, d, s, b, t, d, s, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathrm, d, t, iint, sigma, mathbf, b, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, s, iint, sigma, frac, partial, mathbf, b, partial, t, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, s, maxwell, s, equations, can, be, formulated, with, possibly, time, dependent, surfaces, and, volumes, by, using, the, differential, version, and, using, gauss, and, stokes, formula, appropriately, the, definitions, of, charge, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, can, be, altered, to, simplify, theoretical, calculation, by, absorbing, dimensioned, factors, of, 0, and, 0, into, the, units, and, thus, redefining, these, with, a, corresponding, change, in, the, values, of, the, quantities, for, the, lorentz, force, law, this, yields, the, same, physics, i, e, trajectories, of, charged, particles, or, work, done, by, an, electric, motor, these, definitions, are, often, preferred, in, theoretical, and, high, energy, physics, where, it, is, natural, to, take, the, electric, and, magnetic, field, with, the, same, units, to, simplify, the, appearance, of, the, electromagnetic, tensor, the, lorentz, covariant, object, unifying, electric, and, magnetic, field, would, then, contain, components, with, uniform, unit, and, dimension, vii, such, modified, definitions, are, conventionally, used, with, the, gaussian, cgs, units, using, these, definitions, colloquially, in, gaussian, units, the, maxwell, equations, become, the, equations, simplify, slightly, when, a, system, of, quantities, is, chosen, in, the, speed, of, light, c, is, used, for, nondimensionalization, so, that, for, example, seconds, and, lightseconds, are, interchangeable, and, c, 1, further, changes, are, possible, by, absorbing, factors, of, 4, this, process, called, rationalization, affects, whether, coulomb, s, law, or, gauss, s, law, includes, such, a, factor, see, heaviside, lorentz, units, used, mainly, in, particle, physics, the, equivalence, of, the, differential, and, integral, formulations, are, a, consequence, of, the, gauss, divergence, theorem, and, the, kelvin, stokes, theorem, according, to, the, purely, mathematical, gauss, divergence, theorem, the, electric, flux, through, the, boundary, surface, can, be, rewritten, as, the, integral, version, of, gauss, s, equation, can, thus, be, rewritten, as, e, 0, d, v, 0, displaystyle, iiint, omega, left, nabla, cdot, mathbf, e, frac, rho, varepsilon, 0, right, mathrm, d, v, 0, since, is, arbitrary, e, g, an, arbitrary, small, ball, with, arbitrary, center, this, is, satisfied, if, and, only, if, the, integrand, is, zero, everywhere, this, is, the, differential, equations, formulation, of, gauss, equation, up, to, a, trivial, rearrangement, similarly, rewriting, the, magnetic, flux, in, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, in, integral, form, gives, which, is, satisfied, for, all, if, and, only, if, b, 0, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, b, 0, everywhere, by, the, kelvin, stokes, theorem, we, can, rewrite, the, line, integrals, of, the, fields, around, the, closed, boundary, curve, to, an, integral, of, the, circulation, of, the, fields, i, e, their, curls, over, a, surface, it, bounds, i, e, b, d, b, d, s, displaystyle, oint, partial, sigma, mathbf, b, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, iint, sigma, nabla, times, mathbf, b, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, s, hence, the, amp, re, maxwell, law, the, modified, version, of, amp, re, s, circuital, law, in, integral, form, can, be, rewritten, as, b, 0, j, 0, e, t, d, s, 0, displaystyle, iint, sigma, left, nabla, times, mathbf, b, mu, 0, left, mathbf, j, varepsilon, 0, frac, partial, mathbf, e, partial, t, right, right, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, s, 0, since, can, be, chosen, arbitrarily, e, g, as, an, arbitrary, small, arbitrary, oriented, and, arbitrary, centered, disk, we, conclude, that, the, integrand, is, zero, if, and, only, if, the, amp, re, maxwell, law, in, differential, equations, form, is, satisfied, the, equivalence, of, faraday, s, law, in, differential, and, integral, form, follows, likewise, the, line, integrals, and, curls, are, analogous, to, quantities, in, classical, fluid, dynamics, the, circulation, of, a, fluid, is, the, line, integral, of, the, fluid, s, flow, velocity, field, around, a, closed, loop, and, the, vorticity, of, the, fluid, is, the, curl, of, the, velocity, field, the, invariance, of, charge, can, be, derived, as, a, corollary, of, maxwell, s, equations, the, left, hand, side, of, the, amp, re, maxwell, law, has, zero, divergence, by, the, div, curl, identity, expanding, the, divergence, of, the, right, hand, side, interchanging, derivatives, and, applying, gauss, s, law, gives, 0, b, 0, j, 0, e, t, 0, j, 0, t, e, 0, j, t, displaystyle, 0, nabla, cdot, nabla, times, mathbf, b, nabla,

divergence, theorem, this, means, the, rate, of, change, of, charge, in, a, fixed, volume, equals, the, net, current, flowing, through, the, boundary, in, particular, in, an, isolated, system, the, total, charge, is, conserved, in, a, region, with, no, charges, 0, and, no, currents, j, 0, such, as, in, vacuum, maxwell, s, equations, reduce, to, e, 0, e, b, t, 0, b, 0, b, 0, 0, e, t, 0,

found, that, the, known, values, for, 0, displaystyle, varepsilon, 0, and, 0, displaystyle, mu, 0, give, c, 2, 998, 10, 8, m, s, displaystyle, c, approx, 2, 998, times, 10, 8, text, m, s, then, already, known, to, be, the, speed, of, light, in, free, space, this, led, him, to, propose, that, light, and, radio, waves, were, propagating, electromagnetic, waves, since, amply, confirmed, in, the, old, si, system, of, units, the, values, of, 0, 4, 10, 7, displaystyle, mu, 0, 4, pi, times, 10, 7, and, c, 299, 792, 458, m, s, displaystyle, c, 299, 792, 458, text, m, s, are, defined,

the, new, si, system, only, c, keeps, its, defined, value, and, the, electron, charge, gets, a, defined, value, in, materials, with, relative, permittivity, r, and, relative, permeability, r, the,

addition, e, and, b, are, perpendicular, to, each, other, and, to, the, direction, of, wave, propagation, and, are, in, phase, with, each, other, a, sinusoidal, plane, wave, is, one, special, solution, of, these, equations, maxwell, s, equations, explain, how, these, waves, can, physically, propagate, through, space, the, changing, magnetic, field, creates, a, changing, electric, field, through, faraday, s, law, in, turn, that, electric, field, creates, a, changing, magnetic, field, through, maxwell, s, modification, of, amp, re, s, circuital, law, this, perpetual, cycle, allows, these, waves, now, known, as, electromagnetic, radiation, to, move, through, space, at, velocity, c, the, above, equations, are, the, microscopic, version, of, maxwell, s, equations, expressing, the, electric, and, the, magnetic, fields, in, terms, of, the, possibly, atomic, level, charges, and, currents, present, this, is, sometimes, called, the, general, form, but, the, macroscopic, version, below, is, equally, general, the, difference, being, one, of, bookkeeping, the, microscopic, version, is, sometimes, called, maxwell, s, equations, in, vacuum, this, refers, to, the, fact, that, the, material, medium, is, not, built, into, the, structure, of, the, equations, but, appears, only, in, the, charge, and, current, terms, the, microscopic, version, was, introduced, by, lorentz, who, tried, to, use, it, to, derive, the, macroscopic, properties, of, bulk, matter, from, its, microscopic, constituents, 5, maxwell, s, macroscopic, equations, also, known, as, maxwell, s, equations, in, matter, are, more, similar, to, those, that, maxwell, introduced, himself, in, the, macroscopic, equations, the, influence, of, bound, charge, q, b, and, bound, current, i, b, is, incorporated, into, the, displacement, field, d, and, the, magnetizing, field, h, while, the, equations, depend, only, on, the, free, charges, q, f, and, free, currents, i, f, this, reflects, a, splitting, of, the, total, electric, charge, q, and, current, i, and, their, densities, and, j, into, free, and, bound, parts, q, q, f, q, b, f, b, d, v, d, v, i, i, f, i, b, j, f, j, b, d, s, j, d, s, displaystyle,

d, and, h, need, to, be, determined, through, phenomenological, constituent, equations, relating, these, fields, to, the, electric, field, e, and, the, magnetic, field, b, together, with, the, bound, charge, and, current, see, below, for, a, detailed, description, of, the, differences, between, the, microscopic, equations, dealing, with, total, charge, and, current, including, material, contributions, useful, in, air, vacuum, and, the, macroscopic, equations, dealing, with, free, charge, and, current, practical, to, use, within, materials, when, an, electric, field, is, applied, to, a, dielectric, material, its, molecules, respond, by, forming, microscopic, electric, dipoles, their, atomic, nuclei, move, a, tiny, distance, in, the, direction, of, the, field, while, their, electrons, move, a, tiny, distance, in, the, opposite, direction, this, produces, a, macroscopic, bound, charge, in, the, material, even, though, all, of, the, charges, involved, are, bound, to, individual, molecules, for, example, if, every, molecule, responds, the, same, similar, to, that, shown, in, the, figure, these, tiny, movements, of, charge, combine, to, produce, a, layer, of, positive, bound, charge, on, one, side, of, the, material, and, a, layer, of, negative, charge, on, the, other, side, the, bound, charge, is, most, conveniently, described, in, terms, of, the, polarization, p, of, the, material, its, dipole, moment, per, unit, volume, if, p, is, uniform, a, macroscopic, separation, of, charge, is, produced, only, at, the, surfaces, where, p, enters, and, leaves, the, material, for, non, uniform, p, a, charge, is, also, produced, in, the, bulk, somewhat, similarly, in, all, materials, the, constituent, atoms, exhibit, magnetic, moments, that, are, intrinsically, linked, to, the, angular, momentum, of, the, components, of, the, atoms, most, notably, their, electrons, the, connection, to, angular, momentum, suggests, the, picture, of, an, assembly, of, microscopic, current, loops, outside, the, material, an, assembly, of, such, microscopic, current, loops, is, not, different, from, a, macroscopic, current, circulating, around, the, material, s, surface, despite, the, fact, that, no, individual, charge, is, traveling, a, large, distance, these, bound, currents, can, be, described, using, the, magnetization, m, the, very, complicated, and, granular, bound, charges, and, bound, currents, therefore, can, be, represented, on, the, macroscopic, scale, in, terms, of, p, and, m, which, average, these, charges, and, currents, on, a, sufficiently, large, scale, so, as, not, to, see, the, granularity, of, individual, atoms, but, also, sufficiently, small, that, they, vary, with, location, in, the, material, as, such, maxwell, s, macroscopic, equations, ignore, many, details, on, a, fine, scale, that, can, be, unimportant, to, understanding, matters, on, a, gross, scale, by, calculating, fields, that, are, averaged, over, some, suitable, volume, the, definitions, of, the, auxiliary, fields, are, d, r, t, 0, e, r, t, p, r, t, h, r, t, 1, 0, b, r, t, m, r, t, displaystyle, begin, aligned, mathbf, d,

the, polarization, field, and, m, is, the, magnetization, field, which, are, defined, in, terms, of, microscopic, bound, charges, and, bound, currents, respectively, the, macroscopic, bound, charge, density, b, and, bound, current, density, j, b, in, terms, of, polarization, p, and, magnetization, m, are, then, defined, as, b, p, j, b, m, p, t, displaystyle, begin, aligned, rho, text, b, nabla,

d, and, h, the, macroscopic, maxwell, s, equations, reproduce, the, microscopic, equations, in, order, to, apply, maxwell, s, macroscopic, equations, it, is, necessary, to, specify, the, relations, between, displacement, field, d, and, the, electric, field, e, as, well, as, the, magnetizing, field, h, and, the, magnetic, field, b, equivalently, we, have, to, specify, the, dependence, of, the, polarization, p, hence, the, bound, charge, and, the, magnetization, m, hence, the, bound, current, on, the, applied, electric, and, magnetic, field, the, equations, specifying, this, response, are, called, constitutive, relations, for, real, world, materials, the, constitutive, relations, are, rarely, simple, except, approximately, and, usually, determined, by, experiment, see, the, main, article, on, constitutive, relations, for, a, fuller, description, 44, 45, for, materials, without, polarization, and, magnetization, the, constitutive, relations, are, by, definition, 2, d, 0, e, h,

the, laboratory, high, power, pulsed, lasers, the, interatomic, electric, fields, of, materials, of, the, order, of, 10, 11, v, m, are, much, higher, than, the, external, field, for, the, magnetizing,

similarly, h, or, m, is, not, necessarily, proportional, to, b, in, general, d, and, h, depend, on, both, e, and, b, on, location, and, time, and, possibly, other, physical, quantities, in, applications, one, also, has, to, describe, how, the, free, currents, and, charge, density, behave, in, terms, of, e, and, b, possibly, coupled, to, other, physical, quantities, like, pressure, and,

the, two, homogeneous, maxwell, equations, from, the, two, inhomogeneous, ones, each, formulation, has, versions, directly, in, terms, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, and, indirectly, in, terms, of, the, electrical, potential, and, the, vector, potential, a, potentials, were, introduced, as, a, convenient, way, to, solve, the, homogeneous, equations, but, it, was, thought, that, all, observable, physics, was, contained, in, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, or, relativistically, the, faraday, tensor, the, potentials, play, a, central, role, in, quantum, mechanics, however, and, act, quantum, mechanically, with, observable, consequences, even, when, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, vanish, aharonov, bohm, effect, each, table, describes, one, formalism, see, the, main, article, for, details, of, each, formulation, the, direct, spacetime, formulations, make, manifest, that, the, maxwell, equations, are, relativistically, invariant, where, space, and, time, are, treated, on, equal, footing, because, of, this, symmetry, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, treated, on, equal, footing, and, are, recognized, as, components, of, the, faraday, tensor, this, reduces, the, four, maxwell, equations, to, two, which, simplifies, the, equations, although, we, can, no, longer, use, the, familiar, vector, formulation, maxwell, equations, in, formulation, that, do, not, treat, space, and, time, manifestly, on, the, same, footing, have, lorentz, invariance, as, a, hidden, symmetry, this, was, a, major, source, of, inspiration, for, the, development, of, relativity, theory, indeed, even, the, formulation, that, treats, space, and, time, separately, is, not, a, non, relativistic, approximation, and, describes, the, same, physics, by, simply, renaming, variables, for, this, reason, the, relativistic, invariant, equations, are, usually, called, the, maxwell, equations, as, well, each, table, below, describes, one, formalism, a, 0, displaystyle,

matrix, representation, of, maxwell, s, equations, historically, a, quaternionic, formulation, was, used, maxwell, s, equations, are, partial, differential, equations, that, relate, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, to, each, other, and, to, the, electric, charges, and, currents, often, the, charges, and, currents, are, themselves, dependent, on, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, via, the, lorentz, force, equation, and, the, constitutive, relations, these, all, form, a, set, of, coupled, partial, differential, equations, which, are, often, very, difficult, to, solve, the, solutions, encompass, all, the, diverse, phenomena, of, classical, electromagnetism, some, general, remarks, follow, as, for, any, differential, equation, boundary, conditions, and, initial, conditions, are, necessary, for, a, unique, solution, for, example, even, with, no, charges, and, no, currents, anywhere, in, spacetime, there, are, the, obvious, solutions, for, which, e, and, b, are, zero, or, constant, but, there, are, also, non, trivial, solutions, corresponding, to, electromagnetic, waves, in, some, cases, maxwell, s, equations, are, solved, over, the, whole, of, space, and, boundary, conditions, are, given, as, asymptotic, limits, at, infinity, in, other, cases, maxwell, s, equations, are, solved, in, a, finite, region, of, space, with, appropriate, conditions, on, the, boundary, of, that, region, for, example, an, artificial, absorbing, boundary, representing, the, rest, of, the, universe, or, periodic, boundary, conditions, or, walls, that, isolate, a, small, region, from, the, outside, world, as, with, a, waveguide, or, cavity, resonator, jefimenko, s, equations, or, the, closely, related, li, nard, wiechert, potentials, are, the, explicit, solution, to, maxwell, s, equations, for, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, created, by, any, given, distribution, of, charges, and, currents, it, assumes, specific, initial, conditions, to, obtain, the, so, called, retarded, solution, where, the, only, fields, present, are, the, ones, created, by, the, charges, however, jefimenko, s, equations, are, unhelpful, in, situations, when, the, charges, and, currents, are, themselves, affected, by, the, fields, they, create, numerical, methods, for, differential, equations, can, be, used, to, compute, approximate, solutions, of, maxwell, s, equations, when, exact, solutions, are, impossible, these, include, the, finite, element, method, and, finite, difference, time, domain, method, for, more, details, see, computational, electromagnetics, maxwell, s, equations, seem, overdetermined, in, that, they, involve, six, unknowns, the, three, components, of, e, and, b, but, eight, equations, one, for, each, of, the, two, gauss, s, laws, three, vector, components, each, for, faraday, s, and, amp, re, s, circuital, laws, the, currents, and, charges, are, not, unknowns, being, freely, specifiable, subject, to, charge, conservation, this, is, related, to, a, certain, limited, kind, of, redundancy, in, maxwell, s, equations, it, can, be, proven, that, any, system, satisfying, faraday, s, law, and, amp, re, s, circuital, law, automatically, also, satisfies, the, two, gauss, s, laws, as, long, as, the, system, s, initial, condition, does, and, assuming, conservation, of, charge, and, the, nonexistence, of, magnetic, monopoles, this, explanation, was, first, introduced, by, julius, adams, stratton, in, 1941, although, it, is, possible, to, simply, ignore, the, two, gauss, s, laws, in, a, numerical, algorithm, apart, from, the, initial, conditions, the, imperfect, precision, of, the, calculations, can, lead, to, ever, increasing, violations, of, those, laws, by, introducing, dummy, variables, characterizing, these, violations, the, four, equations, become, not, overdetermined, after, all, the, resulting, formulation, can, lead, to, more, accurate, algorithms, that, take, all, four, laws, into, account, both, identities, b, 0, e, 0, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, nabla, times, mathbf, b, equiv, 0, nabla, cdot, nabla, times, mathbf, e, equiv, 0, which, reduce, eight, equations, to, six, independent, ones, are, the, true, reason, of, overdetermination, equivalently, the, overdetermination, can, be, viewed, as, implying, conservation, of, electric, and, magnetic, charge, as, they, are, required, in, the, derivation, described, above, but, implied, by, the, two, gauss, s, laws, for, linear, algebraic, equations, one, can, make, nice, rules, to, rewrite, the, equations, and, unknowns, the, equations, can, be, linearly, dependent, but, in, differential, equations, and, especially, partial, differential, equations, pdes, one, needs, appropriate, boundary, conditions, which, depend, in, not, so, obvious, ways, on, the, equations, even, more, if, one, rewrites, them, in, terms, of, vector, and, scalar, potential, then, the, equations, are, underdetermined, because, of, gauge, fixing, maxwell, s, equations, and, the, lorentz, force, law, along, with, the, rest, of, classical, electromagnetism, are, extraordinarily, successful, at, explaining, and, predicting, a, variety, of, phenomena, however, they, do, not, account, for, quantum, effects, and, so, their, domain, of, applicability, is, limited, maxwell, s, equations, are, thought, of, as, the, classical, limit, of, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, some, observed, electromagnetic, phenomena, are, incompatible, with, maxwell, s, equations, these, include, photon, photon, scattering, and, many, other, phenomena, related, to, photons, or, virtual, photons, nonclassical, light, and, quantum, entanglement, of, electromagnetic, fields, see, quantum, optics, e, g, quantum, cryptography, cannot, be, described, by, maxwell, theory, not, even, approximately, the, approximate, nature, of, maxwell, s, equations, becomes, more, and, more, apparent, when, going, into, the, extremely, strong, field, regime, see, euler, heisenberg, lagrangian, or, to, extremely, small, distances, finally, maxwell, s, equations, cannot, explain, any, phenomenon, involving, individual, photons, interacting, with, quantum, matter, such, as, the, photoelectric, effect, planck, s, law, the, duane, hunt, law, and, single, photon, light, detectors, however, many, such, phenomena, may, be, approximated, using, a, halfway, theory, of, quantum, matter, coupled, to, a, classical, electromagnetic, field, either, as, external, field, or, with, the, expected, value, of, the, charge, current, and, density, on, the, right, hand, side, of, maxwell, s, equations, popular, variations, on, the, maxwell, equations, as, a, classical, theory, of, electromagnetic, fields, are, relatively, scarce, because, the, standard, equations, have, stood, the, test, of, time, remarkably, well, maxwell, s, equations, posit, that, there, is, electric, charge, but, no, magnetic, charge, also, called, magnetic, monopoles, in, the, universe, indeed, magnetic, charge, has, never, been, observed, despite, extensive, searches, and, may, not, exist, if, they, did, exist, both, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, and, faraday, s, law, would, need, to, be, modified, and, the, resulting, four, equations, would, be, fully, symmetric, under, the, interchange, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, 273, 275
