atmospheric, circulation, is, the, large, scale, movement, of, air, and, together, with, ocean, circulation, is, the, means, by, which, thermal, energy, is, redistributed, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, earth, s, atmospheric, circulation, varies, from, year, to, year, but, the, large, scale, structure, of, its, circulation, remains, fairly, constant, the, smaller, scale, weather, systems, mid, latitude, depressions, or, tropical, convective, cells, occur, chaotically, and, long, range, weather, predictions, of, those, cannot, be, made, beyond, ten, days, in, practice, or, a, month, in, theory, see, chaos, theory, and, the, butterfly, effect, the, earth, s, weather, is, a, consequence, of, its, illumination, by, the, sun, and, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, the, atmospheric, circulation, can, be, viewed, as, a, heat, engine, driven, by, the, sun, s, energy, and, whose, energy, sink, ultimately, is, the, blackness, of, space, the, work, produced, by, that, engine, causes, the, motion, of, the, masses, of, air, and, in, that, process, it, redistributes, the, energy, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, surface, near, the, tropics, to, the, latitudes, nearer, the, poles, and, thence, to, space, the, large, scale, atmospheric, circulation, cells, shift, polewards, in, warmer, periods, for, example, interglacials, compared, to, glacials, but, remain, largely, constant, as, they, are, fundamentally, a, property, of, the, earth, s, size, rotation, rate, heating, and, atmospheric, depth, all, of, which, change, little, over, very, long, time, periods, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, a, tectonic, uplift, can, significantly, alter, their, major, elements, such, as, the, jet, stream, and, plate, tectonics, may, shift, ocean, currents, during, the, extremely, hot, climates, of, the, mesozoic, a, third, desert, belt, may, have, existed, at, the, equator, the, wind, belts, girdling, the, planet, are, organised, into, three, cells, in, each, hemisphere, the, hadley, cell, the, ferrel, cell, and, the, polar, cell, those, cells, exist, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, vast, bulk, of, the, atmospheric, motion, occurs, in, the, hadley, cell, the, high, pressure, systems, acting, on, the, earth, s, surface, are, balanced, by, the, low, pressure, systems, elsewhere, as, a, result, there, is, a, balance, of, forces, acting, on, the, earth, s, surface, the, horse, latitudes, are, an, area, of, high, pressure, at, about, 30, to, 35, latitude, north, or, south, where, winds, diverge, into, the, adjacent, zones, of, hadley, or, ferrel, cells, and, which, typically, have, light, winds, sunny, skies, and, little, precipitation, the, atmospheric, circulation, pattern, that, george, hadley, described, was, an, attempt, to, explain, the, trade, winds, the, hadley, cell, is, a, closed, circulation, loop, which, begins, at, the, equator, there, moist, air, is, warmed, by, the, earth, s, surface, decreases, in, density, and, rises, a, similar, air, mass, rising, on, the, other, side, of, the, equator, forces, those, rising, air, masses, to, move, poleward, the, rising, air, creates, a, low, pressure, zone, near, the, equator, as, the, air, moves, poleward, it, cools, becomes, denser, and, descends, at, about, the, 30th, parallel, creating, a, high, pressure, area, the, descended, air, then, travels, toward, the, equator, along, the, surface, replacing, the, air, that, rose, from, the, equatorial, zone, closing, the, loop, of, the, hadley, cell, the, poleward, movement, of, the, air, in, the, upper, part, of, the, troposphere, deviates, toward, the, east, caused, by, the, coriolis, acceleration, at, the, ground, level, however, the, movement, of, the, air, toward, the, equator, in, the, lower, troposphere, deviates, toward, the, west, producing, a, wind, from, the, east, the, winds, that, flow, to, the, west, from, the, east, easterly, wind, at, the, ground, level, in, the, hadley, cell, are, called, the, trade, winds, though, the, hadley, cell, is, described, as, located, at, the, equator, it, shifts, northerly, to, higher, latitudes, in, june, and, july, and, southerly, toward, lower, latitudes, in, december, and, january, as, a, result, of, the, sun, s, heating, of, the, surface, the, zone, where, the, greatest, heating, takes, place, is, called, the, thermal, equator, as, the, southern, hemisphere, s, summer, is, in, december, to, march, the, movement, of, the, thermal, equator, to, higher, southern, latitudes, takes, place, then, the, hadley, system, provides, an, example, of, a, thermally, direct, circulation, the, power, of, the, hadley, system, considered, as, a, heat, engine, is, estimated, at, 200, tera, watts, part, of, the, air, rising, at, 60, latitude, diverges, at, high, altitude, toward, the, poles, and, creates, the, polar, cell, the, rest, moves, toward, the, equator, where, it, collides, at, 30, latitude, with, the, high, level, air, of, the, hadley, cell, there, it, subsides, and, strengthens, the, high, pressure, ridges, beneath, a, large, part, of, the, energy, that, drives, the, ferrel, cell, is, provided, by, the, polar, and, hadley, cells, circulating, on, either, side, which, drag, the, air, of, the, ferrel, cell, with, it, the, ferrel, cell, theorized, by, william, ferrel, 1817, 1891, is, therefore, a, secondary, circulation, feature, whose, existence, depends, upon, the, hadley, and, polar, cells, on, either, side, of, it, it, might, be, thought, of, as, an, eddy, created, by, the, hadley, and, polar, cells, the, air, of, the, ferrel, cell, that, descends, at, 30, latitude, returns, poleward, at, the, ground, level, and, as, it, does, so, it, deviates, toward, the, east, in, the, upper, atmosphere, of, the, ferrel, cell, the, air, moving, toward, the, equator, deviates, toward, the, west, both, of, those, deviations, as, in, the, case, of, the, hadley, and, polar, cells, are, driven, by, conservation, of, angular, momentum, as, a, result, just, as, the, easterly, trade, winds, are, found, below, the, hadley, cell, the, westerlies, are, found, beneath, the, ferrel, cell, the, ferrel, cell, is, weak, because, it, has, neither, a, strong, source, of, heat, nor, a, strong, sink, so, the, airflow, and, temperatures, within, it, are, variable, for, this, reason, the, mid, latitudes, are, sometimes, known, as, the, zone, of, mixing, the, hadley, and, polar, cells, are, truly, closed, loops, the, ferrel, cell, is, not, and, the, telling, point, is, in, the, westerlies, which, are, more, formally, known, as, the, prevailing, westerlies, the, easterly, trade, winds, and, the, polar, easterlies, have, nothing, over, which, to, prevail, as, their, parent, circulation, cells, are, strong, enough, and, face, few, obstacles, either, in, the, form, of, massive, terrain, features, or, high, pressure, zones, the, weaker, westerlies, of, the, ferrel, cell, however, can, be, disrupted, the, local, passage, of, a, cold, front, may, change, that, in, a, matter, of, minutes, and, frequently, does, as, a, result, at, the, surface, winds, can, vary, abruptly, in, direction, but, the, winds, above, the, surface, where, they, are, less, disrupted, by, terrain, are, essentially, westerly, a, low, pressure, zone, at, 60, latitude, that, moves, toward, the, equator, or, a, high, pressure, zone, at, 30, latitude, that, moves, poleward, will, accelerate, the, westerlies, of, the, ferrel, cell, a, strong, high, moving, polewards, may, bring, westerly, winds, for, days, the, ferrel, system, acts, as, a, heat, pump, with, a, coefficient, of, performance, of, 12, 1, consuming, kinetic, energy, from, the, hadley, and, polar, systems, at, an, approximate, rate, of, 275, terawatts, the, polar, cell, is, a, simple, system, with, strong, convection, drivers, though, cool, and, dry, relative, to, equatorial, air, the, air, masses, at, the, 60th, parallel, are, still, sufficiently, warm, and, moist, to, undergo, convection, and, drive, a, thermal, loop, at, the, 60th, parallel, the, air, rises, to, the, tropopause, about, 8, km, at, this, latitude, and, moves, poleward, as, it, does, so, the, upper, level, air, mass, deviates, toward, the, east, when, the, air, reaches, the, polar, areas, it, has, cooled, by, radiation, to, space, and, is, considerably, denser, than, the, underlying, air, it, descends, creating, a, cold, dry, high, pressure, area, at, the, polar, surface, level, the, mass, of, air, is, driven, away, from, the, pole, toward, the, 60th, parallel, replacing, the, air, that, rose, there, and, the, polar, circulation, cell, is, complete, as, the, air, at, the, surface, moves, toward, the, equator, it, deviates, westwards, again, as, a, result, of, the, coriolis, effect, the, air, flows, at, the, surface, are, called, the, polar, easterlies, flowing, from, northeast, to, southwest, near, the, north, pole, and, from, southeast, to, northwest, near, the, south, pole, the, outflow, of, air, mass, from, the, cell, creates, harmonic, waves, in, the, atmosphere, known, as, rossby, waves, these, ultra, long, waves, determine, the, path, of, the, polar, jet, stream, which, travels, within, the, transitional, zone, between, the, tropopause, and, the, ferrel, cell, by, acting, as, a, heat, sink, the, polar, cell, moves, the, abundant, heat, from, the, equator, toward, the, polar, regions, the, polar, cell, terrain, and, katabatic, winds, in, antarctica, can, create, very, cold, conditions, at, the, surface, for, instance, the, lowest, temperature, recorded, on, earth, 89, 2, c, at, vostok, station, in, antarctica, measured, in, 1983, the, hadley, cell, and, the, polar, cell, are, similar, in, that, they, are, thermally, direct, in, other, words, they, exist, as, a, direct, consequence, of, surface, temperatures, their, thermal, characteristics, drive, the, weather, in, their, domain, the, sheer, volume, of, energy, that, the, hadley, cell, transports, and, the, depth, of, the, heat, sink, contained, within, the, polar, cell, ensures, that, transient, weather, phenomena, not, only, have, negligible, effect, on, the, systems, as, a, whole, but, except, under, unusual, circumstances, they, do, not, form, the, endless, chain, of, passing, highs, and, lows, which, is, part, of, everyday, life, for, mid, latitude, dwellers, under, the, ferrel, cell, at, latitudes, between, 30, and, 60, latitude, is, unknown, above, the, 60th, and, below, the, 30th, parallels, there, are, some, notable, exceptions, to, this, rule, over, europe, unstable, weather, extends, to, at, least, the, 70th, parallel, north, while, the, hadley, ferrel, and, polar, cells, whose, axes, are, oriented, along, parallels, or, latitudes, are, the, major, features, of, global, heat, transport, they, do, not, act, alone, temperature, differences, also, drive, a, set, of, circulation, cells, whose, axes, of, circulation, are, longitudinally, oriented, this, atmospheric, motion, is, known, as, zonal, overturning, circulation, latitudinal, circulation, is, a, result, of, the, highest, solar, radiation, per, unit, area, solar, intensity, falling, on, the, tropics, the, solar, intensity, decreases, as, the, latitude, increases, reaching, essentially, zero, at, the, poles, longitudinal, circulation, however, is, a, result, of, the, heat, capacity, of, water, its, absorptivity, and, its, mixing, water, absorbs, more, heat, than, does, the, land, but, its, temperature, does, not, rise, as, greatly, as, does, the, land, as, a, result, temperature, variations, on, land, are, greater, than, on, water, the, hadley, ferrel, and, polar, cells, operate, at, the, largest, scale, of, thousands, of, kilometers, synoptic, scale, the, latitudinal, circulation, can, also, act, on, this, scale, of, oceans, and, continents, and, this, effect, is, seasonal, or, even, decadal, warm, air, rises, over, the, equatorial, continental, and, western, pacific, ocean, regions, when, it, reaches, the, tropopause, it, cools, and, subsides, in, a, region, of, relatively, cooler, water, mass, the, pacific, ocean, cell, plays, a, particularly, important, role, in, earth, s, weather, this, entirely, ocean, based, cell, comes, about, as, the, result, of, a, marked, difference, in, the, surface, temperatures, of, the, western, and, eastern, pacific, under, ordinary, circumstances, the, western, pacific, waters, are, warm, and, the, eastern, waters, are, cool, the, process, begins, when, strong, convective, activity, over, equatorial, east, asia, and, subsiding, cool, air, off, south, america, s, west, coast, create, a, wind, pattern, which, pushes, pacific, water, westward, and, piles, it, up, in, the, western, pacific, water, levels, in, the, western, pacific, are, about, 60, cm, higher, than, in, the, eastern, pacific, the, daily, diurnal, longitudinal, effects, are, at, the, mesoscale, a, horizontal, range, of, 5, to, several, hundred, kilometres, during, the, day, air, warmed, by, the, relatively, hotter, land, rises, and, as, it, does, so, it, draws, a, cool, breeze, from, the, sea, that, replaces, the, risen, air, at, night, the, relatively, warmer, water, and, cooler, land, reverses, the, process, and, a, breeze, from, the, land, of, air, cooled, by, the, land, is, carried, offshore, by, night, the, pacific, cell, is, of, such, importance, that, it, has, been, named, the, walker, circulation, after, sir, gilbert, walker, an, early, 20th, century, director, of, british, observatories, in, india, who, sought, a, means, of, predicting, when, the, monsoon, winds, of, india, would, fail, while, he, was, never, successful, in, doing, so, his, work, led, him, to, the, discovery, of, a, link, between, the, periodic, pressure, variations, in, the, indian, ocean, and, those, between, the, eastern, and, western, pacific, which, he, termed, the, southern, oscillation, the, movement, of, air, in, the, walker, circulation, affects, the, loops, on, either, side, under, normal, circumstances, the, weather, behaves, as, expected, but, every, few, years, the, winters, become, unusually, warm, or, unusually, cold, or, the, frequency, of, hurricanes, increases, or, decreases, and, the, pattern, sets, in, for, an, indeterminate, period, the, walker, cell, plays, a, key, role, in, this, and, in, the, el, ni, o, phenomenon, if, convective, activity, slows, in, the, western, pacific, for, some, reason, this, reason, is, not, currently, known, the, climates, of, areas, adjacent, to, the, western, pacific, are, affected, first, the, upper, level, westerly, winds, fail, this, cuts, off, the, source, of, returning, cool, air, that, would, normally, subside, at, about, 30, south, latitude, and, therefore, the, air, returning, as, surface, easterlies, ceases, there, are, two, consequences, warm, water, ceases, to, surge, into, the, eastern, pacific, from, the, west, it, was, piled, by, past, easterly, winds, since, there, is, no, longer, a, surface, wind, to, push, it, into, the, area, of, the, east, pacific, this, and, the, corresponding, effects, of, the, southern, oscillation, result, in, long, term, unseasonable, temperatures, and, precipitation, patterns, in, north, and, south, america, australia, and, southeast, africa, and, the, disruption, of, ocean, currents, meanwhile, in, the, atlantic, fast, blowing, upper, level, westerlies, of, the, hadley, cell, form, which, would, ordinarily, be, blocked, by, the, walker, circulation, and, unable, to, reach, such, intensities, these, winds, disrupt, the, tops, of, nascent, hurricanes, and, greatly, diminish, the, number, which, are, able, to, reach, full, strength, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, are, opposite, surface, temperature, anomalies, of, the, southern, pacific, which, heavily, influence, the, weather, on, a, large, scale, in, the, case, of, el, ni, o, warm, surface, water, approaches, the, coasts, of, south, america, which, results, in, blocking, the, upwelling, of, nutrient, rich, deep, water, this, has, serious, impacts, on, the, fish, populations, in, the, la, ni, a, case, the, convective, cell, over, the, western, pacific, strengthens, inordinately, resulting, in, colder, than, normal, winters, in, north, america, and, a, more, robust, cyclone, season, in, south, east, asia, and, eastern, australia, there, is, also, an, increased, upwelling, of, deep, cold, ocean, waters, and, more, intense, uprising, of, surface, air, near, south, america, resulting, in, increasing, numbers, of, drought, occurrences, although, fishermen, reap, benefits, from, the, more, nutrient, filled, eastern, pacific, waters
