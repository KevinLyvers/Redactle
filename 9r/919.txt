x, rays, x, radiation, are, a, form, of, high, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, in, many, languages, it, is, referred, to, as, r, ntgen, radiation, after, the, german, scientist, wilhelm, conrad, r, ntgen, who, discovered, it, in, 1895, and, named, it, x, radiation, to, signify, an, unknown, type, of, radiation, x, ray, wavelengths, are, shorter, than, those, of, ultraviolet, rays, and, longer, than, those, of, gamma, rays, there, is, no, universally, accepted, strict, definition, of, the, bounds, of, the, x, ray, band, roughly, x, rays, have, a, wavelength, ranging, from, 10, nanometers, to, 10, picometers, corresponding, to, frequencies, in, the, range, of, 30, petahertz, to, 30, exahertz, 3, 10, 16, hz, to, 3, 10, 19, hz, and, photon, energies, in, the, range, of, 100, ev, to, 100, kev, respectively, x, rays, can, penetrate, many, solid, substances, such, as, construction, materials, and, living, tissue, so, x, ray, radiography, is, widely, used, in, medical, diagnostics, e, g, checking, for, broken, bones, and, material, science, e, g, identification, of, some, chemical, elements, and, detecting, weak, points, in, construction, materials, however, x, rays, are, ionizing, radiation, and, exposure, to, high, intensities, can, be, hazardous, to, health, causing, damage, to, dna, cancer, and, at, high, dosages, burns, and, radiation, sickness, their, generation, and, use, is, strictly, controlled, by, public, health, authorities, before, their, discovery, in, 1895, x, rays, were, just, a, type, of, unidentified, radiation, emanating, from, experimental, discharge, tubes, they, were, noticed, by, scientists, investigating, cathode, rays, produced, by, such, tubes, which, are, energetic, electron, beams, that, were, first, observed, in, 1869, many, of, the, early, crookes, tubes, invented, around, 1875, undoubtedly, radiated, x, rays, because, early, researchers, noticed, effects, that, were, attributable, to, them, as, detailed, below, crookes, tubes, created, free, electrons, by, ionization, of, the, residual, air, in, the, tube, by, a, high, dc, voltage, of, anywhere, between, a, few, kilovolts, and, 100, kv, this, voltage, accelerated, the, electrons, coming, from, the, cathode, to, a, high, enough, velocity, that, they, created, x, rays, when, they, struck, the, anode, or, the, glass, wall, of, the, tube, the, earliest, experimenter, thought, to, have, unknowingly, produced, x, rays, was, william, morgan, in, 1785, he, presented, a, paper, to, the, royal, society, of, london, describing, the, effects, of, passing, electrical, currents, through, a, partially, evacuated, glass, tube, producing, a, glow, created, by, x, rays, this, work, was, further, explored, by, humphry, davy, and, his, assistant, michael, faraday, when, stanford, university, physics, professor, fernando, sanford, created, his, electric, photography, he, also, unknowingly, generated, and, detected, x, rays, from, 1886, to, 1888, he, studied, in, the, hermann, von, helmholtz, laboratory, in, berlin, where, he, became, familiar, with, the, cathode, rays, generated, in, vacuum, tubes, when, a, voltage, was, applied, across, separate, electrodes, as, previously, studied, by, heinrich, hertz, and, philipp, lenard, his, letter, of, 6, january, 1893, describing, his, discovery, as, electric, photography, to, the, physical, review, was, duly, published, and, an, article, entitled, without, lens, or, light, photographs, taken, with, plate, and, object, in, darkness, appeared, in, the, san, francisco, examiner, starting, in, 1888, philipp, lenard, conducted, experiments, to, see, whether, cathode, rays, could, pass, out, of, the, crookes, tube, into, the, air, he, built, a, crookes, tube, with, a, window, at, the, end, made, of, thin, aluminium, facing, the, cathode, so, the, cathode, rays, would, strike, it, later, called, a, lenard, tube, he, found, that, something, came, through, that, would, expose, photographic, plates, and, cause, fluorescence, he, measured, the, penetrating, power, of, these, rays, through, various, materials, it, has, been, suggested, that, at, least, some, of, these, lenard, rays, were, actually, x, rays, in, 1889, ivan, puluj, a, lecturer, in, experimental, physics, at, the, prague, polytechnic, who, since, 1877, had, been, constructing, various, designs, of, gas, filled, tubes, to, investigate, their, properties, published, a, paper, on, how, sealed, photographic, plates, became, dark, when, exposed, to, the, emanations, from, the, tubes, helmholtz, formulated, mathematical, equations, for, x, rays, he, postulated, a, dispersion, theory, before, r, ntgen, made, his, discovery, and, announcement, he, based, it, on, the, electromagnetic, theory, of, light, however, he, did, not, work, with, actual, x, rays, in, 1894, nikola, tesla, noticed, damaged, film, in, his, lab, that, seemed, to, be, associated, with, crookes, tube, experiments, and, began, investigating, this, invisible, radiant, energy, after, r, ntgen, identified, the, x, ray, tesla, began, making, x, ray, images, of, his, own, using, high, voltages, and, tubes, of, his, own, design, as, well, as, crookes, tubes, on, 8, november, 1895, german, physics, professor, wilhelm, r, ntgen, stumbled, on, x, rays, while, experimenting, with, lenard, tubes, and, crookes, tubes, and, began, studying, them, he, wrote, an, initial, report, on, a, new, kind, of, ray, a, preliminary, communication, and, on, 28, december, 1895, submitted, it, to, w, rzburg, s, physical, medical, society, journal, this, was, the, first, paper, written, on, x, rays, r, ntgen, referred, to, the, radiation, as, x, to, indicate, that, it, was, an, unknown, type, of, radiation, some, early, texts, refer, to, them, as, chi, rays, having, interpreted, x, as, the, uppercase, greek, letter, chi, the, name, x, rays, stuck, although, over, r, ntgen, s, great, objections, many, of, his, colleagues, suggested, calling, them, r, ntgen, rays, they, are, still, referred, to, as, such, in, many, languages, including, german, hungarian, ukrainian, danish, polish, czech, bulgarian, swedish, finnish, portuguese, estonian, slovak, slovenian, turkish, russian, latvian, lithuanian, albanian, japanese, dutch, georgian, hebrew, icelandic, and, norwegian, r, ntgen, received, the, first, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, discovery, there, are, conflicting, accounts, of, his, discovery, because, r, ntgen, had, his, lab, notes, burned, after, his, death, but, this, is, a, likely, reconstruction, by, his, biographers, r, ntgen, was, investigating, cathode, rays, from, a, crookes, tube, which, he, had, wrapped, in, black, cardboard, so, that, the, visible, light, from, the, tube, would, not, interfere, using, a, fluorescent, screen, painted, with, barium, platinocyanide, he, noticed, a, faint, green, glow, from, the, screen, about, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, away, r, ntgen, realized, some, invisible, rays, coming, from, the, tube, were, passing, through, the, cardboard, to, make, the, screen, glow, he, found, they, could, also, pass, through, books, and, papers, on, his, desk, r, ntgen, threw, himself, into, investigating, these, unknown, rays, systematically, two, months, after, his, initial, discovery, he, published, his, paper, r, ntgen, discovered, their, medical, use, when, he, made, a, picture, of, his, wife, s, hand, on, a, photographic, plate, formed, due, to, x, rays, the, photograph, of, his, wife, s, hand, was, the, first, photograph, of, a, human, body, part, using, x, rays, when, she, saw, the, picture, she, said, i, have, seen, my, death, the, discovery, of, x, rays, generated, significant, interest, r, ntgen, s, biographer, otto, glasser, estimated, that, in, 1896, alone, as, many, as, 49, essays, and, 1044, articles, about, the, new, rays, were, published, this, was, probably, a, conservative, estimate, if, one, considers, that, nearly, every, paper, around, the, world, extensively, reported, about, the, new, discovery, with, a, magazine, such, as, science, dedicating, as, many, as, 23, articles, to, it, in, that, year, alone, sensationalist, reactions, to, the, new, discovery, included, publications, linking, the, new, kind, of, rays, to, occult, and, paranormal, theories, such, as, telepathy, r, ntgen, immediately, noticed, x, rays, could, have, medical, applications, along, with, his, 28, december, physical, medical, society, submission, he, sent, a, letter, to, physicians, he, knew, around, europe, 1, january, 1896, news, and, the, creation, of, shadowgrams, spread, rapidly, with, scottish, electrical, engineer, alan, archibald, campbell, swinton, being, the, first, after, r, ntgen, to, create, an, x, ray, photograph, of, a, hand, through, february, there, were, 46, experimenters, taking, up, the, technique, in, north, america, alone, the, first, use, of, x, rays, under, clinical, conditions, was, by, john, hall, edwards, in, birmingham, england, on, 11, january, 1896, when, he, radiographed, a, needle, stuck, in, the, hand, of, an, associate, on, 14, february, 1896, hall, edwards, was, also, the, first, to, use, x, rays, in, a, surgical, operation, in, early, 1896, several, weeks, after, r, ntgen, s, discovery, ivan, romanovich, tarkhanov, irradiated, frogs, and, insects, with, x, rays, concluding, that, the, rays, not, only, photograph, but, also, affect, the, living, function, at, around, the, same, time, the, zoological, illustrator, james, green, began, to, use, x, rays, to, examine, fragile, specimens, george, albert, boulenger, first, mentioned, this, work, in, a, paper, he, delivered, before, the, zoological, society, of, london, in, may, 1896, the, book, sciagraphs, of, british, batrachians, and, reptiles, sciagraph, is, an, obsolete, name, for, an, x, ray, photograph, by, green, and, james, h, gardiner, with, a, foreword, by, boulenger, was, published, in, 1897, the, first, medical, x, ray, made, in, the, united, states, was, obtained, using, a, discharge, tube, of, puluj, s, design, in, january, 1896, on, reading, of, r, ntgen, s, discovery, frank, austin, of, dartmouth, college, tested, all, of, the, discharge, tubes, in, the, physics, laboratory, and, found, that, only, the, puluj, tube, produced, x, rays, this, was, a, result, of, puluj, s, inclusion, of, an, oblique, target, of, mica, used, for, holding, samples, of, fluorescent, material, within, the, tube, on, 3, february, 1896, gilman, frost, professor, of, medicine, at, the, college, and, his, brother, edwin, frost, professor, of, physics, exposed, the, wrist, of, eddie, mccarthy, whom, gilman, had, treated, some, weeks, earlier, for, a, fracture, to, the, x, rays, and, collected, the, resulting, image, of, the, broken, bone, on, gelatin, photographic, plates, obtained, from, howard, langill, a, local, photographer, also, interested, in, r, ntgen, s, work, many, experimenters, including, r, ntgen, himself, in, his, original, experiments, came, up, with, methods, to, view, x, ray, images, live, using, some, form, of, luminescent, screen, r, ntgen, used, a, screen, coated, with, barium, platinocyanide, on, 5, february, 1896, live, imaging, devices, were, developed, by, both, italian, scientist, enrico, salvioni, his, cryptoscope, and, william, francis, magie, of, princeton, university, his, skiascope, both, using, barium, platinocyanide, american, inventor, thomas, edison, started, research, soon, after, r, ntgen, s, discovery, and, investigated, materials, ability, to, fluoresce, when, exposed, to, x, rays, finding, that, calcium, tungstate, was, the, most, effective, substance, in, may, 1896, he, developed, the, first, mass, produced, live, imaging, device, his, vitascope, later, called, the, fluoroscope, which, became, the, standard, for, medical, x, ray, examinations, edison, dropped, x, ray, research, around, 1903, before, the, death, of, clarence, madison, dally, one, of, his, glassblowers, dally, had, a, habit, of, testing, x, ray, tubes, on, his, own, hands, developing, a, cancer, in, them, so, tenacious, that, both, arms, were, amputated, in, a, futile, attempt, to, save, his, life, in, 1904, he, became, the, first, known, death, attributed, to, x, ray, exposure, during, the, time, the, fluoroscope, was, being, developed, serbian, american, physicist, mihajlo, pupin, using, a, calcium, tungstate, screen, developed, by, edison, found, that, using, a, fluorescent, screen, decreased, the, exposure, time, it, took, to, create, an, x, ray, for, medical, imaging, from, an, hour, to, a, few, minutes, in, 1901, u, s, president, william, mckinley, was, shot, twice, in, an, assassination, attempt, while, attending, the, pan, american, exposition, in, buffalo, new, york, while, one, bullet, only, grazed, his, sternum, another, had, lodged, somewhere, deep, inside, his, abdomen, and, could, not, be, found, a, worried, mckinley, aide, sent, word, to, inventor, thomas, edison, to, rush, an, x, ray, machine, to, buffalo, to, find, the, stray, bullet, it, arrived, but, was, not, used, while, the, shooting, itself, had, not, been, lethal, gangrene, had, developed, along, the, path, of, the, bullet, and, mckinley, died, of, septic, shock, due, to, bacterial, infection, six, days, later, with, the, widespread, experimentation, with, x, rays, after, their, discovery, in, 1895, by, scientists, physicians, and, inventors, came, many, stories, of, burns, hair, loss, and, worse, in, technical, journals, of, the, time, in, february, 1896, professor, john, daniel, and, william, lofland, dudley, of, vanderbilt, university, reported, hair, loss, after, dudley, was, x, rayed, a, child, who, had, been, shot, in, the, head, was, brought, to, the, vanderbilt, laboratory, in, 1896, before, trying, to, find, the, bullet, an, experiment, was, attempted, for, which, dudley, with, his, characteristic, devotion, to, science, volunteered, daniel, reported, that, 21, days, after, taking, a, picture, of, dudley, s, skull, with, an, exposure, time, of, one, hour, he, noticed, a, bald, spot, 5, centimeters, 2, in, in, diameter, on, the, part, of, his, head, nearest, the, x, ray, tube, a, plate, holder, with, the, plates, towards, the, side, of, the, skull, was, fastened, and, a, coin, placed, between, the, skull, and, the, head, the, tube, was, fastened, at, the, other, side, at, a, distance, of, one, half, inch, from, the, hair, beyond, burns, hair, loss, and, cancer, x, rays, can, be, linked, to, infertility, in, males, based, on, the, amount, of, radiation, used, in, august, 1896, h, d, hawks, a, graduate, of, columbia, college, suffered, severe, hand, and, chest, burns, from, an, x, ray, demonstration, it, was, reported, in, electrical, review, and, led, to, many, other, reports, of, problems, associated, with, x, rays, being, sent, in, to, the, publication, many, experimenters, including, elihu, thomson, at, edison, s, lab, william, j, morton, and, nikola, tesla, also, reported, burns, elihu, thomson, deliberately, exposed, a, finger, to, an, x, ray, tube, over, a, period, of, time, and, suffered, pain, swelling, and, blistering, other, effects, were, sometimes, blamed, for, the, damage, including, ultraviolet, rays, and, according, to, tesla, ozone, many, physicians, claimed, there, were, no, effects, from, x, ray, exposure, at, all, on, 3, august, 1905, in, san, francisco, california, elizabeth, fleischman, an, american, x, ray, pioneer, died, from, complications, as, a, result, of, her, work, with, x, rays, hall, edwards, developed, a, cancer, then, called, x, ray, dermatitis, sufficiently, advanced, by, 1904, to, cause, him, to, write, papers, and, give, public, addresses, on, the, dangers, of, x, rays, his, left, arm, had, to, be, amputated, at, the, elbow, in, 1908, and, four, fingers, on, his, right, arm, soon, thereafter, leaving, only, a, thumb, he, died, of, cancer, in, 1926, his, left, hand, is, kept, at, birmingham, university, the, many, applications, of, x, rays, immediately, generated, enormous, interest, workshops, began, making, specialized, versions, of, crookes, tubes, for, generating, x, rays, and, these, first, generation, cold, cathode, or, crookes, x, ray, tubes, were, used, until, about, 1920, a, typical, early, 20th, century, medical, x, ray, system, consisted, of, a, ruhmkorff, coil, connected, to, a, cold, cathode, crookes, x, ray, tube, a, spark, gap, was, typically, connected, to, the, high, voltage, side, in, parallel, to, the, tube, and, used, for, diagnostic, purposes, the, spark, gap, allowed, detecting, the, polarity, of, the, sparks, measuring, voltage, by, the, length, of, the, sparks, thus, determining, the, hardness, of, the, vacuum, of, the, tube, and, it, provided, a, load, in, the, event, the, x, ray, tube, was, disconnected, to, detect, the, hardness, of, the, tube, the, spark, gap, was, initially, opened, to, the, widest, setting, while, the, coil, was, operating, the, operator, reduced, the, gap, until, sparks, began, to, appear, a, tube, in, which, the, spark, gap, began, to, spark, at, around, 6, 4, centimeters, 2, 5, in, was, considered, soft, low, vacuum, and, suitable, for, thin, body, parts, such, as, hands, and, arms, a, 13, centimeter, 5, in, spark, indicated, the, tube, was, suitable, for, shoulders, and, knees, an, 18, to, 23, centimeter, 7, to, 9, in, spark, would, indicate, a, higher, vacuum, suitable, for, imaging, the, abdomen, of, larger, individuals, since, the, spark, gap, was, connected, in, parallel, to, the, tube, the, spark, gap, had, to, be, opened, until, the, sparking, ceased, to, operate, the, tube, for, imaging, exposure, time, for, photographic, plates, was, around, half, a, minute, for, a, hand, to, a, couple, of, minutes, for, a, thorax, the, plates, may, have, a, small, addition, of, fluorescent, salt, to, reduce, exposure, times, crookes, tubes, were, unreliable, they, had, to, contain, a, small, quantity, of, gas, invariably, air, as, a, current, will, not, flow, in, such, a, tube, if, they, are, fully, evacuated, however, as, time, passed, the, x, rays, caused, the, glass, to, absorb, the, gas, causing, the, tube, to, generate, harder, x, rays, until, it, soon, stopped, operating, larger, and, more, frequently, used, tubes, were, provided, with, devices, for, restoring, the, air, known, as, softeners, these, often, took, the, form, of, a, small, side, tube, that, contained, a, small, piece, of, mica, a, mineral, that, traps, relatively, large, quantities, of, air, within, its, structure, a, small, electrical, heater, heated, the, mica, causing, it, to, release, a, small, amount, of, air, thus, restoring, the, tube, s, efficiency, however, the, mica, had, a, limited, life, and, the, restoration, process, was, difficult, to, control, in, 1904, john, ambrose, fleming, invented, the, thermionic, diode, the, first, kind, of, vacuum, tube, this, used, a, hot, cathode, that, caused, an, electric, current, to, flow, in, a, vacuum, this, idea, was, quickly, applied, to, x, ray, tubes, and, hence, heated, cathode, x, ray, tubes, called, coolidge, tubes, completely, replaced, the, troublesome, cold, cathode, tubes, by, about, 1920, in, about, 1906, the, physicist, charles, barkla, discovered, that, x, rays, could, be, scattered, by, gases, and, that, each, element, had, a, characteristic, x, ray, spectrum, he, won, the, 1917, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, this, discovery, in, 1912, max, von, laue, paul, knipping, and, walter, friedrich, first, observed, the, diffraction, of, x, rays, by, crystals, this, discovery, along, with, the, early, work, of, paul, peter, ewald, william, henry, bragg, and, william, lawrence, bragg, gave, birth, to, the, field, of, x, ray, crystallography, in, 1913, henry, moseley, performed, crystallography, experiments, with, x, rays, emanating, from, various, metals, and, formulated, moseley, s, law, which, relates, the, frequency, of, the, x, rays, to, the, atomic, number, of, the, metal, the, coolidge, x, ray, tube, was, invented, the, same, year, by, william, d, coolidge, it, made, possible, the, continuous, emissions, of, x, rays, modern, x, ray, tubes, are, based, on, this, design, often, employing, the, use, of, rotating, targets, which, allow, for, significantly, higher, heat, dissipation, than, static, targets, further, allowing, higher, quantity, x, ray, output, for, use, in, high, powered, applications, such, as, rotational, ct, scanners, the, use, of, x, rays, for, medical, purposes, which, developed, into, the, field, of, radiation, therapy, was, pioneered, by, major, john, hall, edwards, in, birmingham, england, then, in, 1908, he, had, to, have, his, left, arm, amputated, because, of, the, spread, of, x, ray, dermatitis, on, his, arm, medical, science, also, used, the, motion, picture, to, study, human, physiology, in, 1913, a, motion, picture, was, made, in, detroit, showing, a, hard, boiled, egg, inside, a, human, stomach, this, early, x, ray, movie, was, recorded, at, a, rate, of, one, still, image, every, four, seconds, dr, lewis, gregory, cole, of, new, york, was, a, pioneer, of, the, technique, which, he, called, serial, radiography, in, 1918, x, rays, were, used, in, association, with, motion, picture, cameras, to, capture, the, human, skeleton, in, motion, in, 1920, it, was, used, to, record, the, movements, of, tongue, and, teeth, in, the, study, of, languages, by, the, institute, of, phonetics, in, england, in, 1914, marie, curie, developed, radiological, cars, to, support, soldiers, injured, in, world, war, i, the, cars, would, allow, for, rapid, x, ray, imaging, of, wounded, soldiers, so, battlefield, surgeons, could, quickly, and, more, accurately, operate, from, the, early, 1920s, through, to, the, 1950s, x, ray, machines, were, developed, to, assist, in, the, fitting, of, shoes, and, were, sold, to, commercial, shoe, stores, concerns, regarding, the, impact, of, frequent, or, poorly, controlled, use, were, expressed, in, the, 1950s, leading, to, the, practice, s, eventual, end, that, decade, the, x, ray, microscope, was, developed, during, the, 1950s, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, launched, on, 23, july, 1999, has, been, allowing, the, exploration, of, the, very, violent, processes, in, the, universe, that, produce, x, rays, unlike, visible, light, which, gives, a, relatively, stable, view, of, the, universe, the, x, ray, universe, is, unstable, it, features, stars, being, torn, apart, by, black, holes, galactic, collisions, and, novae, and, neutron, stars, that, build, up, layers, of, plasma, that, then, explode, into, space, an, x, ray, laser, device, was, proposed, as, part, of, the, reagan, administration, s, strategic, defense, initiative, in, the, 1980s, but, the, only, test, of, the, device, a, sort, of, laser, blaster, or, death, ray, powered, by, a, thermonuclear, explosion, gave, inconclusive, results, for, technical, and, political, reasons, the, overall, project, including, the, x, ray, laser, was, defunded, though, was, later, revived, by, the, second, bush, administration, as, national, missile, defense, using, different, technologies, phase, contrast, x, ray, imaging, refers, to, a, variety, of, techniques, that, use, phase, information, of, an, x, ray, beam, to, form, the, image, due, to, its, good, sensitivity, to, density, differences, it, is, especially, useful, for, imaging, soft, tissues, it, has, become, an, important, method, for, visualizing, cellular, and, histological, structures, in, a, wide, range, of, biological, and, medical, studies, there, are, several, technologies, being, used, for, x, ray, phase, contrast, imaging, all, using, different, principles, to, convert, phase, variations, in, the, x, rays, emerging, from, an, object, into, intensity, variations, these, include, propagation, based, phase, contrast, talbot, interferometry, refraction, enhanced, imaging, and, x, ray, interferometry, these, methods, provide, higher, contrast, compared, to, normal, absorption, based, x, ray, imaging, making, it, possible, to, distinguish, from, each, other, details, that, have, almost, similar, density, a, disadvantage, is, that, these, methods, require, more, sophisticated, equipment, such, as, synchrotron, or, microfocus, x, ray, sources, x, ray, optics, and, high, resolution, x, ray, detectors, x, rays, with, high, photon, energies, above, 5, 10, kev, below, 0, 2, 0, 1, nm, wavelength, are, called, hard, x, rays, while, those, with, lower, energy, and, longer, wavelength, are, called, soft, x, rays, the, intermediate, range, with, photon, energies, of, several, kev, is, often, referred, to, as, tender, x, rays, due, to, their, penetrating, ability, hard, x, rays, are, widely, used, to, image, the, inside, of, objects, e, g, in, medical, radiography, and, airport, security, the, term, x, ray, is, metonymically, used, to, refer, to, a, radiographic, image, produced, using, this, method, in, addition, to, the, method, itself, since, the, wavelengths, of, hard, x, rays, are, similar, to, the, size, of, atoms, they, are, also, useful, for, determining, crystal, structures, by, x, ray, crystallography, by, contrast, soft, x, rays, are, easily, absorbed, in, air, the, attenuation, length, of, 600, ev, 2, nm, x, rays, in, water, is, less, than, 1, micrometer, there, is, no, consensus, for, a, definition, distinguishing, between, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, one, common, practice, is, to, distinguish, between, the, two, types, of, radiation, based, on, their, source, x, rays, are, emitted, by, electrons, while, gamma, rays, are, emitted, by, the, atomic, nucleus, this, definition, has, several, problems, other, processes, can, also, generate, these, high, energy, photons, or, sometimes, the, method, of, generation, is, not, known, one, common, alternative, is, to, distinguish, x, and, gamma, radiation, on, the, basis, of, wavelength, or, equivalently, frequency, or, photon, energy, with, radiation, shorter, than, some, arbitrary, wavelength, such, as, 10, 11, m, 0, 1, defined, as, gamma, radiation, this, criterion, assigns, a, photon, to, an, unambiguous, category, but, is, only, possible, if, wavelength, is, known, some, measurement, techniques, do, not, distinguish, between, detected, wavelengths, however, these, two, definitions, often, coincide, since, the, electromagnetic, radiation, emitted, by, x, ray, tubes, generally, has, a, longer, wavelength, and, lower, photon, energy, than, the, radiation, emitted, by, radioactive, nuclei, occasionally, one, term, or, the, other, is, used, in, specific, contexts, due, to, historical, precedent, based, on, measurement, detection, technique, or, based, on, their, intended, use, rather, than, their, wavelength, or, source, thus, gamma, rays, generated, for, medical, and, industrial, uses, for, example, radiotherapy, in, the, ranges, of, 6, 20, mev, can, in, this, context, also, be, referred, to, as, x, rays, x, ray, photons, carry, enough, energy, to, ionize, atoms, and, disrupt, molecular, bonds, this, makes, it, a, type, of, ionizing, radiation, and, therefore, harmful, to, living, tissue, a, very, high, radiation, dose, over, a, short, period, of, time, causes, burns, and, radiation, sickness, while, lower, doses, can, give, an, increased, risk, of, radiation, induced, cancer, in, medical, imaging, this, increased, cancer, risk, is, generally, greatly, outweighed, by, the, benefits, of, the, examination, the, ionizing, capability, of, x, rays, can, be, used, in, cancer, treatment, to, kill, malignant, cells, using, radiation, therapy, it, is, also, used, for, material, characterization, using, x, ray, spectroscopy, hard, x, rays, can, traverse, relatively, thick, objects, without, being, much, absorbed, or, scattered, for, this, reason, x, rays, are, widely, used, to, image, the, inside, of, visually, opaque, objects, the, most, often, seen, applications, are, in, medical, radiography, and, airport, security, scanners, but, similar, techniques, are, also, important, in, industry, e, g, industrial, radiography, and, industrial, ct, scanning, and, research, e, g, small, animal, ct, the, penetration, depth, varies, with, several, orders, of, magnitude, over, the, x, ray, spectrum, this, allows, the, photon, energy, to, be, adjusted, for, the, application, so, as, to, give, sufficient, transmission, through, the, object, and, at, the, same, time, provide, good, contrast, in, the, image, x, rays, have, much, shorter, wavelengths, than, visible, light, which, makes, it, possible, to, probe, structures, much, smaller, than, can, be, seen, using, a, normal, microscope, this, property, is, used, in, x, ray, microscopy, to, acquire, high, resolution, images, and, also, in, x, ray, crystallography, to, determine, the, positions, of, atoms, in, crystals, x, rays, interact, with, matter, in, three, main, ways, through, photoabsorption, compton, scattering, and, rayleigh, scattering, the, strength, of, these, interactions, depends, on, the, energy, of, the, x, rays, and, the, elemental, composition, of, the, material, but, not, much, on, chemical, properties, since, the, x, ray, photon, energy, is, much, higher, than, chemical, binding, energies, photoabsorption, or, photoelectric, absorption, is, the, dominant, interaction, mechanism, in, the, soft, x, ray, regime, and, for, the, lower, hard, x, ray, energies, at, higher, energies, compton, scattering, dominates, the, probability, of, a, photoelectric, absorption, per, unit, mass, is, approximately, proportional, to, z, 3, e, 3, textstyle, z, 3, e, 3, where, z, textstyle, z, is, the, atomic, number, and, e, textstyle, e, is, the, energy, of, the, incident, photon, this, rule, is, not, valid, close, to, inner, shell, electron, binding, energies, where, there, are, abrupt, changes, in, interaction, probability, so, called, absorption, edges, however, the, general, trend, of, high, absorption, coefficients, and, thus, short, penetration, depths, for, low, photon, energies, and, high, atomic, numbers, is, very, strong, for, soft, tissue, photoabsorption, dominates, up, to, about, 26, kev, photon, energy, where, compton, scattering, takes, over, for, higher, atomic, number, substances, this, limit, is, higher, the, high, amount, of, calcium, z, 20, textstyle, z, 20, in, bones, together, with, their, high, density, is, what, makes, them, show, up, so, clearly, on, medical, radiographs, a, photoabsorbed, photon, transfers, all, its, energy, to, the, electron, with, which, it, interacts, thus, ionizing, the, atom, to, which, the, electron, was, bound, and, producing, a, photoelectron, that, is, likely, to, ionize, more, atoms, in, its, path, an, outer, electron, will, fill, the, vacant, electron, position, and, produce, either, a, characteristic, x, ray, or, an, auger, electron, these, effects, can, be, used, for, elemental, detection, through, x, ray, spectroscopy, or, auger, electron, spectroscopy, compton, scattering, is, the, predominant, interaction, between, x, rays, and, soft, tissue, in, medical, imaging, compton, scattering, is, an, inelastic, scattering, of, the, x, ray, photon, by, an, outer, shell, electron, part, of, the, energy, of, the, photon, is, transferred, to, the, scattering, electron, thereby, ionizing, the, atom, and, increasing, the, wavelength, of, the, x, ray, the, scattered, photon, can, go, in, any, direction, but, a, direction, similar, to, the, original, direction, is, more, likely, especially, for, high, energy, x, rays, the, probability, for, different, scattering, angles, is, described, by, the, klein, nishina, formula, the, transferred, energy, can, be, directly, obtained, from, the, scattering, angle, from, the, conservation, of, energy, and, momentum, rayleigh, scattering, is, the, dominant, elastic, scattering, mechanism, in, the, x, ray, regime, inelastic, forward, scattering, gives, rise, to, the, refractive, index, which, for, x, rays, is, only, slightly, below, 1, whenever, charged, particles, electrons, or, ions, of, sufficient, energy, hit, a, material, x, rays, are, produced, x, rays, can, be, generated, by, an, x, ray, tube, a, vacuum, tube, that, uses, a, high, voltage, to, accelerate, the, electrons, released, by, a, hot, cathode, to, a, high, velocity, the, high, velocity, electrons, collide, with, a, metal, target, the, anode, creating, the, x, rays, in, medical, x, ray, tubes, the, target, is, usually, tungsten, or, a, more, crack, resistant, alloy, of, rhenium, 5, and, tungsten, 95, but, sometimes, molybdenum, for, more, specialized, applications, such, as, when, softer, x, rays, are, needed, as, in, mammography, in, crystallography, a, copper, target, is, most, common, with, cobalt, often, being, used, when, fluorescence, from, iron, content, in, the, sample, might, otherwise, present, a, problem, the, maximum, energy, of, the, produced, x, ray, photon, is, limited, by, the, energy, of, the, incident, electron, which, is, equal, to, the, voltage, on, the, tube, times, the, electron, charge, so, an, 80, kv, tube, cannot, create, x, rays, with, an, energy, greater, than, 80, kev, when, the, electrons, hit, the, target, x, rays, are, created, by, two, different, atomic, processes, so, the, resulting, output, of, a, tube, consists, of, a, continuous, bremsstrahlung, spectrum, falling, off, to, zero, at, the, tube, voltage, plus, several, spikes, at, the, characteristic, lines, the, voltages, used, in, diagnostic, x, ray, tubes, range, from, roughly, 20, kv, to, 150, kv, and, thus, the, highest, energies, of, the, x, ray, photons, range, from, roughly, 20, kev, to, 150, kev, both, of, these, x, ray, production, processes, are, inefficient, with, only, about, one, percent, of, the, electrical, energy, used, by, the, tube, converted, into, x, rays, and, thus, most, of, the, electric, power, consumed, by, the, tube, is, released, as, waste, heat, when, producing, a, usable, flux, of, x, rays, the, x, ray, tube, must, be, designed, to, dissipate, the, excess, heat, a, specialized, source, of, x, rays, which, is, becoming, widely, used, in, research, is, synchrotron, radiation, which, is, generated, by, particle, accelerators, its, unique, features, are, x, ray, outputs, many, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, those, of, x, ray, tubes, wide, x, ray, spectra, excellent, collimation, and, linear, polarization, short, nanosecond, bursts, of, x, rays, peaking, at, 15, kev, in, energy, may, be, reliably, produced, by, peeling, pressure, sensitive, adhesive, tape, from, its, backing, in, a, moderate, vacuum, this, is, likely, to, be, the, result, of, recombination, of, electrical, charges, produced, by, triboelectric, charging, the, intensity, of, x, ray, triboluminescence, is, sufficient, for, it, to, be, used, as, a, source, for, x, ray, imaging, x, rays, can, also, be, produced, by, fast, protons, or, other, positive, ions, the, proton, induced, x, ray, emission, or, particle, induced, x, ray, emission, is, widely, used, as, an, analytical, procedure, for, high, energies, the, production, cross, section, is, proportional, to, z, 1, 2, z, 2, 4, where, z, 1, refers, to, the, atomic, number, of, the, ion, z, 2, refers, to, that, of, the, target, atom, an, overview, of, these, cross, sections, is, given, in, the, same, reference, x, rays, are, also, produced, in, lightning, accompanying, terrestrial, gamma, ray, flashes, the, underlying, mechanism, is, the, acceleration, of, electrons, in, lightning, related, electric, fields, and, the, subsequent, production, of, photons, through, bremsstrahlung, this, produces, photons, with, energies, of, some, few, kev, and, several, tens, of, mev, in, laboratory, discharges, with, a, gap, size, of, approximately, 1, meter, length, and, a, peak, voltage, of, 1, mv, x, rays, with, a, characteristic, energy, of, 160, kev, are, observed, a, possible, explanation, is, the, encounter, of, two, streamers, and, the, production, of, high, energy, run, away, electrons, however, microscopic, simulations, have, shown, that, the, duration, of, electric, field, enhancement, between, two, streamers, is, too, short, to, produce, a, significant, number, of, run, away, electrons, recently, it, has, been, proposed, that, air, perturbations, in, the, vicinity, of, streamers, can, facilitate, the, production, of, run, away, electrons, and, hence, of, x, rays, from, discharges, x, ray, detectors, vary, in, shape, and, function, depending, on, their, purpose, imaging, detectors, such, as, those, used, for, radiography, were, originally, based, on, photographic, plates, and, later, photographic, film, but, are, now, mostly, replaced, by, various, digital, detector, types, such, as, image, plates, and, flat, panel, detectors, for, radiation, protection, direct, exposure, hazard, is, often, evaluated, using, ionization, chambers, while, dosimeters, are, used, to, measure, the, radiation, dose, the, person, has, been, exposed, to, x, ray, spectra, can, be, measured, either, by, energy, dispersive, or, wavelength, dispersive, spectrometers, for, x, ray, diffraction, applications, such, as, x, ray, crystallography, hybrid, photon, counting, detectors, are, widely, used, since, r, ntgen, s, discovery, that, x, rays, can, identify, bone, structures, x, rays, have, been, used, for, medical, imaging, the, first, medical, use, was, less, than, a, month, after, his, paper, on, the, subject, up, to, 2010, five, billion, medical, imaging, examinations, had, been, conducted, worldwide, radiation, exposure, from, medical, imaging, in, 2006, made, up, about, 50, of, total, ionizing, radiation, exposure, in, the, united, states, projectional, radiography, is, the, practice, of, producing, two, dimensional, images, using, x, ray, radiation, bones, contain, a, high, concentration, of, calcium, which, due, to, its, relatively, high, atomic, number, absorbs, x, rays, efficiently, this, reduces, the, amount, of, x, rays, reaching, the, detector, in, the, shadow, of, the, bones, making, them, clearly, visible, on, the, radiograph, the, lungs, and, trapped, gas, also, show, up, clearly, because, of, lower, absorption, compared, to, tissue, while, differences, between, tissue, types, are, harder, to, see, projectional, radiographs, are, useful, in, the, detection, of, pathology, of, the, skeletal, system, as, well, as, for, detecting, some, disease, processes, in, soft, tissue, some, notable, examples, are, the, very, common, chest, x, ray, which, can, be, used, to, identify, lung, diseases, such, as, pneumonia, lung, cancer, or, pulmonary, edema, and, the, abdominal, x, ray, which, can, detect, bowel, or, intestinal, obstruction, free, air, from, visceral, perforations, and, free, fluid, in, ascites, x, rays, may, also, be, used, to, detect, pathology, such, as, gallstones, which, are, rarely, radiopaque, or, kidney, stones, which, are, often, but, not, always, visible, traditional, plain, x, rays, are, less, useful, in, the, imaging, of, soft, tissues, such, as, the, brain, or, muscle, one, area, where, projectional, radiographs, are, used, extensively, is, in, evaluating, how, an, orthopedic, implant, such, as, a, knee, hip, or, shoulder, replacement, is, situated, in, the, body, with, respect, to, the, surrounding, bone, this, can, be, assessed, in, two, dimensions, from, plain, radiographs, or, it, can, be, assessed, in, three, dimensions, if, a, technique, called, 2d, to, 3d, registration, is, used, this, technique, purportedly, negates, projection, errors, associated, with, evaluating, implant, position, from, plain, radiographs, dental, radiography, is, commonly, used, in, the, diagnoses, of, common, oral, problems, such, as, cavities, in, medical, diagnostic, applications, the, low, energy, soft, x, rays, are, unwanted, since, they, are, totally, absorbed, by, the, body, increasing, the, radiation, dose, without, contributing, to, the, image, hence, a, thin, metal, sheet, often, of, aluminium, called, an, x, ray, filter, is, usually, placed, over, the, window, of, the, x, ray, tube, absorbing, the, low, energy, part, in, the, spectrum, this, is, called, hardening, the, beam, since, it, shifts, the, center, of, the, spectrum, towards, higher, energy, or, harder, x, rays, to, generate, an, image, of, the, cardiovascular, system, including, the, arteries, and, veins, angiography, an, initial, image, is, taken, of, the, anatomical, region, of, interest, a, second, image, is, then, taken, of, the, same, region, after, an, iodinated, contrast, agent, has, been, injected, into, the, blood, vessels, within, this, area, these, two, images, are, then, digitally, subtracted, leaving, an, image, of, only, the, iodinated, contrast, outlining, the, blood, vessels, the, radiologist, or, surgeon, then, compares, the, image, obtained, to, normal, anatomical, images, to, determine, whether, there, is, any, damage, or, blockage, of, the, vessel, computed, tomography, ct, scanning, is, a, medical, imaging, modality, where, tomographic, images, or, slices, of, specific, areas, of, the, body, are, obtained, from, a, large, series, of, two, dimensional, x, ray, images, taken, in, different, directions, these, cross, sectional, images, can, be, combined, into, a, three, dimensional, image, of, the, inside, of, the, body, ct, scans, are, a, quicker, and, more, cost, effective, imaging, modality, that, can, be, used, for, diagnostic, and, therapeutic, purposes, in, various, medical, disciplines, fluoroscopy, is, an, imaging, technique, commonly, used, by, physicians, or, radiation, therapists, to, obtain, real, time, moving, images, of, the, internal, structures, of, a, patient, through, the, use, of, a, fluoroscope, in, its, simplest, form, a, fluoroscope, consists, of, an, x, ray, source, and, a, fluorescent, screen, between, which, a, patient, is, placed, however, modern, fluoroscopes, couple, the, screen, to, an, x, ray, image, intensifier, and, ccd, video, camera, allowing, the, images, to, be, recorded, and, played, on, a, monitor, this, method, may, use, a, contrast, material, examples, include, cardiac, catheterization, to, examine, for, coronary, artery, blockages, embolization, procedures, to, stop, bleeding, during, hemorrhoidal, artery, embolization, and, barium, swallow, to, examine, for, esophageal, disorders, and, swallowing, disorders, as, of, recent, modern, fluoroscopy, utilizes, short, bursts, of, x, rays, rather, than, a, continuous, beam, to, effectively, lower, radiation, exposure, for, both, the, patient, and, operator, the, use, of, x, rays, as, a, treatment, is, known, as, radiation, therapy, and, is, largely, used, for, the, management, including, palliation, of, cancer, it, requires, higher, radiation, doses, than, those, received, for, imaging, alone, x, rays, beams, are, used, for, treating, skin, cancers, using, lower, energy, x, ray, beams, while, higher, energy, beams, are, used, for, treating, cancers, within, the, body, such, as, brain, lung, prostate, and, breast, x, rays, are, a, form, of, ionizing, radiation, and, are, classified, as, a, carcinogen, by, both, the, world, health, organization, s, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, and, the, u, s, government, diagnostic, x, rays, primarily, from, ct, scans, due, to, the, large, dose, used, increase, the, risk, of, developmental, problems, and, cancer, in, those, exposed, it, is, estimated, that, 0, 4, of, current, cancers, in, the, united, states, are, due, to, computed, tomography, ct, scans, performed, in, the, past, and, that, this, may, increase, to, as, high, as, 1, 5, 2, with, 2007, rates, of, ct, usage, experimental, and, epidemiological, data, currently, do, not, support, the, proposition, that, there, is, a, threshold, dose, of, radiation, below, which, there, is, no, increased, risk, of, cancer, however, this, is, under, increasing, doubt, cancer, risk, can, start, at, the, exposure, of, 1100, mgy, it, is, estimated, that, the, additional, radiation, from, diagnostic, x, rays, will, increase, the, average, person, s, cumulative, risk, of, getting, cancer, by, age, 75, by, 0, 6, 3, 0, the, amount, of, absorbed, radiation, depends, upon, the, type, of, x, ray, test, and, the, body, part, involved, ct, and, fluoroscopy, entail, higher, doses, of, radiation, than, do, plain, x, rays, to, place, the, increased, risk, in, perspective, a, plain, chest, x, ray, will, expose, a, person, to, the, same, amount, from, background, radiation, that, people, are, exposed, to, depending, upon, location, every, day, over, 10, days, while, exposure, from, a, dental, x, ray, is, approximately, equivalent, to, 1, day, of, environmental, background, radiation, each, such, x, ray, would, add, less, than, 1, per, 1, 000, 000, to, the, lifetime, cancer, risk, an, abdominal, or, chest, ct, would, be, the, equivalent, to, 2, 3, years, of, background, radiation, to, the, whole, body, or, 4, 5, years, to, the, abdomen, or, chest, increasing, the, lifetime, cancer, risk, between, 1, per, 1, 000, to, 1, per, 10, 000, this, is, compared, to, the, roughly, 40, chance, of, a, us, citizen, developing, cancer, during, their, lifetime, for, instance, the, effective, dose, to, the, torso, from, a, ct, scan, of, the, chest, is, about, 5, msv, and, the, absorbed, dose, is, about, 14, mgy, a, head, ct, scan, 1, 5, msv, 64, mgy, that, is, performed, once, with, and, once, without, contrast, agent, would, be, equivalent, to, 40, years, of, background, radiation, to, the, head, accurate, estimation, of, effective, doses, due, to, ct, is, difficult, with, the, estimation, uncertainty, range, of, about, 19, to, 32, for, adult, head, scans, depending, upon, the, method, used, the, risk, of, radiation, is, greater, to, a, fetus, so, in, pregnant, patients, the, benefits, of, the, investigation, x, ray, should, be, balanced, with, the, potential, hazards, to, the, fetus, if, there, is, 1, scan, in, 9, months, it, can, be, harmful, to, the, fetus, therefore, women, who, are, pregnant, get, ultrasounds, as, their, diagnostic, imaging, because, this, does, not, use, radiation, if, there, is, too, much, radiation, exposure, there, could, be, harmful, effects, on, the, fetus, or, the, reproductive, organs, of, the, mother, in, the, us, there, are, an, estimated, 62, million, ct, scans, performed, annually, including, more, than, 4, million, on, children, avoiding, unnecessary, x, rays, especially, ct, scans, reduces, radiation, dose, and, any, associated, cancer, risk, medical, x, rays, are, a, significant, source, of, human, made, radiation, exposure, in, 1987, they, accounted, for, 58, of, exposure, from, human, made, sources, in, the, united, states, since, human, made, sources, accounted, for, only, 18, of, the, total, radiation, exposure, most, of, which, came, from, natural, sources, 82, medical, x, rays, only, accounted, for, 10, of, total, american, radiation, exposure, medical, procedures, as, a, whole, including, nuclear, medicine, accounted, for, 14, of, total, radiation, exposure, by, 2006, however, medical, procedures, in, the, united, states, were, contributing, much, more, ionizing, radiation, than, was, the, case, in, the, early, 1980s, in, 2006, medical, exposure, constituted, nearly, half, of, the, total, radiation, exposure, of, the, u, s, population, from, all, sources, the, increase, is, traceable, to, the, growth, in, the, use, of, medical, imaging, procedures, in, particular, computed, tomography, ct, and, to, the, growth, in, the, use, of, nuclear, medicine, dosage, due, to, dental, x, rays, varies, significantly, depending, on, the, procedure, and, the, technology, film, or, digital, depending, on, the, procedure, and, the, technology, a, single, dental, x, ray, of, a, human, results, in, an, exposure, of, 5, to, 40, sv, a, full, mouth, series, of, x, rays, may, result, in, an, exposure, of, up, to, 60, digital, to, 180, film, sv, for, a, yearly, average, of, up, to, 400, sv, financial, incentives, have, been, shown, to, have, a, significant, impact, on, x, ray, use, with, doctors, who, are, paid, a, separate, fee, for, each, x, ray, providing, more, x, rays, early, photon, tomography, or, ept, as, of, 2015, along, with, other, techniques, are, being, researched, as, potential, alternatives, to, x, rays, for, imaging, applications, other, notable, uses, of, x, rays, include, while, generally, considered, invisible, to, the, human, eye, in, special, circumstances, x, rays, can, be, visible, brandes, in, an, experiment, a, short, time, after, r, ntgen, s, landmark, 1895, paper, reported, after, dark, adaptation, and, placing, his, eye, close, to, an, x, ray, tube, seeing, a, faint, blue, gray, glow, which, seemed, to, originate, within, the, eye, itself, upon, hearing, this, r, ntgen, reviewed, his, record, books, and, found, he, too, had, seen, the, effect, when, placing, an, x, ray, tube, on, the, opposite, side, of, a, wooden, door, r, ntgen, had, noted, the, same, blue, glow, seeming, to, emanate, from, the, eye, itself, but, thought, his, observations, to, be, spurious, because, he, only, saw, the, effect, when, he, used, one, type, of, tube, later, he, realized, that, the, tube, which, had, created, the, effect, was, the, only, one, powerful, enough, to, make, the, glow, plainly, visible, and, the, experiment, was, thereafter, readily, repeatable, the, knowledge, that, x, rays, are, actually, faintly, visible, to, the, dark, adapted, naked, eye, has, largely, been, forgotten, today, this, is, probably, due, to, the, desire, not, to, repeat, what, would, now, be, seen, as, a, recklessly, dangerous, and, potentially, harmful, experiment, with, ionizing, radiation, it, is, not, known, what, exact, mechanism, in, the, eye, produces, the, visibility, it, could, be, due, to, conventional, detection, excitation, of, rhodopsin, molecules, in, the, retina, direct, excitation, of, retinal, nerve, cells, or, secondary, detection, via, for, instance, x, ray, induction, of, phosphorescence, in, the, eyeball, with, conventional, retinal, detection, of, the, secondarily, produced, visible, light, though, x, rays, are, otherwise, invisible, it, is, possible, to, see, the, ionization, of, the, air, molecules, if, the, intensity, of, the, x, ray, beam, is, high, enough, the, beamline, from, the, wiggler, at, the, european, synchrotron, radiation, facility, is, one, example, of, such, high, intensity, the, measure, of, x, rays, ionizing, ability, is, called, the, exposure, however, the, effect, of, ionizing, radiation, on, matter, especially, living, tissue, is, more, closely, related, to, the, amount, of, energy, deposited, into, them, rather, than, the, charge, generated, this, measure, of, energy, absorbed, is, called, the, absorbed, dose, the, equivalent, dose, is, the, measure, of, the, biological, effect, of, radiation, on, human, tissue, for, x, rays, it, is, equal, to, the, absorbed, dose
