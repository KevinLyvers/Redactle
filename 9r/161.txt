https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit
a, geostationary, orbit, also, referred, to, as, a, geosynchronous, equatorial, orbit, geo, is, a, circular, geosynchronous, orbit, 35, 786, km, 22, 236, mi, in, altitude, above, earth, s, equator, 42, 164, km, 26, 199, mi, in, radius, from, earth, s, center, and, following, the, direction, of, earth, s, rotation, an, object, in, such, an, orbit, has, an, orbital, period, equal, to, earth, s, rotational, period, one, sidereal, day, and, so, to, ground, observers, it, appears, motionless, in, a, fixed, position, in, the, sky, the, concept, of, a, geostationary, orbit, was, popularised, by, the, science, fiction, writer, arthur, c, clarke, in, the, 1940s, as, a, way, to, revolutionise, telecommunications, and, the, first, satellite, to, be, placed, in, this, kind, of, orbit, was, launched, in, 1963, communications, satellites, are, often, placed, in, a, geostationary, orbit, so, that, earth, based, satellite, antennas, do, not, have, to, rotate, to, track, them, but, can, be, pointed, permanently, at, the, position, in, the, sky, where, the, satellites, are, located, weather, satellites, are, also, placed, in, this, orbit, for, real, time, monitoring, and, data, collection, and, navigation, satellites, to, provide, a, known, calibration, point, and, enhance, gps, accuracy, geostationary, satellites, are, launched, via, a, temporary, orbit, and, placed, in, a, slot, above, a, particular, point, on, the, earth, s, surface, the, orbit, requires, some, stationkeeping, to, keep, its, position, and, modern, retired, satellites, are, placed, in, a, higher, graveyard, orbit, to, avoid, collisions, in, 1929, herman, poto, nik, described, both, geosynchronous, orbits, in, general, and, the, special, case, of, the, geostationary, earth, orbit, in, particular, as, useful, orbits, for, space, stations, the, first, appearance, of, a, geostationary, orbit, in, popular, literature, was, in, october, 1942, in, the, first, venus, equilateral, story, by, george, o, smith, but, smith, did, not, go, into, details, british, science, fiction, author, arthur, c, clarke, popularised, and, expanded, the, concept, in, a, 1945, paper, entitled, extra, terrestrial, relays, can, rocket, stations, give, worldwide, radio, coverage, published, in, wireless, world, magazine, clarke, acknowledged, the, connection, in, his, introduction, to, the, complete, venus, equilateral, the, orbit, which, clarke, first, described, as, useful, for, broadcast, and, relay, communications, satellites, is, sometimes, called, the, clarke, orbit, similarly, the, collection, of, artificial, satellites, in, this, orbit, is, known, as, the, clarke, belt, in, technical, terminology, the, orbit, is, referred, to, as, either, a, geostationary, or, geosynchronous, equatorial, orbit, with, the, terms, used, somewhat, interchangeably, the, first, geostationary, satellite, was, designed, by, harold, rosen, while, he, was, working, at, hughes, aircraft, in, 1959, inspired, by, sputnik, 1, he, wanted, to, use, a, geostationary, satellite, to, globalise, communications, telecommunications, between, the, us, and, europe, was, then, possible, between, just, 136, people, at, a, time, and, reliant, on, high, frequency, radios, and, an, undersea, cable, conventional, wisdom, at, the, time, was, that, it, would, require, too, much, rocket, power, to, place, a, satellite, in, a, geostationary, orbit, and, it, would, not, survive, long, enough, to, justify, the, expense, so, early, efforts, were, put, towards, constellations, of, satellites, in, low, or, medium, earth, orbit, the, first, of, these, were, the, passive, echo, balloon, satellites, in, 1960, followed, by, telstar, 1, in, 1962, although, these, projects, had, difficulties, with, signal, strength, and, tracking, issues, that, could, be, solved, using, geostationary, orbits, the, concept, was, seen, as, impractical, so, hughes, often, withheld, funds, and, support, by, 1961, rosen, and, his, team, had, produced, a, cylindrical, prototype, with, a, diameter, of, 76, centimetres, 30, in, height, of, 38, centimetres, 15, in, weighing, 11, 3, kilograms, 25, lb, light, and, small, enough, to, be, placed, into, orbit, it, was, spin, stabilised, with, a, dipole, antenna, producing, a, pancake, shaped, beam, in, august, 1961, they, were, contracted, to, begin, building, the, real, satellite, they, lost, syncom, 1, to, electronics, failure, but, syncom, 2, was, successfully, placed, into, a, geosynchronous, orbit, in, 1963, although, its, inclined, orbit, still, required, moving, antennas, it, was, able, to, relay, tv, transmissions, and, allowed, for, us, president, john, f, kennedy, in, washington, d, c, to, phone, nigerian, prime, minister, abubakar, tafawa, balewa, aboard, the, usns, kingsport, docked, in, lagos, on, august, 23, 1963, the, first, satellite, placed, in, a, geostationary, orbit, was, syncom, 3, which, was, launched, by, a, delta, d, rocket, in, 1964, with, its, increased, bandwidth, this, satellite, was, able, to, transmit, live, coverage, of, the, summer, olympics, from, japan, to, america, geostationary, orbits, have, been, in, common, use, ever, since, in, particular, for, satellite, television, today, there, are, hundreds, of, geostationary, satellites, providing, remote, sensing, and, communications, although, most, populated, land, locations, on, the, planet, now, have, terrestrial, communications, facilities, microwave, fiber, optic, with, telephone, access, covering, 96, of, the, population, and, internet, access, 90, some, rural, and, remote, areas, in, developed, countries, are, still, reliant, on, satellite, communications, most, commercial, communications, satellites, broadcast, satellites, and, sbas, satellites, operate, in, geostationary, orbits, geostationary, communication, satellites, are, useful, because, they, are, visible, from, a, large, area, of, the, earth, s, surface, extending, 81, away, in, latitude, and, 77, in, longitude, they, appear, stationary, in, the, sky, which, eliminates, the, need, for, ground, stations, to, have, movable, antennas, this, means, that, earth, based, observers, can, erect, small, cheap, and, stationary, antennas, that, are, always, directed, at, the, desired, satellite, 537, however, latency, becomes, significant, as, it, takes, about, 240, ms, for, a, signal, to, pass, from, a, ground, based, transmitter, on, the, equator, to, the, satellite, and, back, again, 538, this, delay, presents, problems, for, latency, sensitive, applications, such, as, voice, communication, so, geostationary, communication, satellites, are, primarily, used, for, unidirectional, entertainment, and, applications, where, low, latency, alternatives, are, not, available, geostationary, satellites, are, directly, overhead, at, the, equator, and, appear, lower, in, the, sky, to, an, observer, nearer, the, poles, as, the, observer, s, latitude, increases, communication, becomes, more, difficult, due, to, factors, such, as, atmospheric, refraction, earth, s, thermal, emission, line, of, sight, obstructions, and, signal, reflections, from, the, ground, or, nearby, structures, at, latitudes, above, about, 81, geostationary, satellites, are, below, the, horizon, and, cannot, be, seen, at, all, because, of, this, some, russian, communication, satellites, have, used, elliptical, molniya, and, tundra, orbits, which, have, excellent, visibility, at, high, latitudes, a, worldwide, network, of, operational, geostationary, meteorological, satellites, is, used, to, provide, visible, and, infrared, images, of, earth, s, surface, and, atmosphere, for, weather, observation, oceanography, and, atmospheric, tracking, as, of, 2019, there, are, 19, satellites, in, either, operation, or, stand, by, these, satellite, systems, include, these, satellites, typically, captures, images, in, the, visual, and, infrared, spectrum, with, a, spatial, resolution, between, 0, 5, and, 4, square, kilometres, the, coverage, is, typically, 70, and, in, some, cases, less, geostationary, satellite, imagery, has, been, used, for, tracking, volcanic, ash, measuring, cloud, top, temperatures, and, water, vapour, oceanography, measuring, land, temperature, and, vegetation, coverage, facilitating, cyclone, path, prediction, and, providing, real, time, cloud, coverage, and, other, tracking, data, some, information, has, been, incorporated, into, meteorological, prediction, models, but, due, to, their, wide, field, of, view, full, time, monitoring, and, lower, resolution, geostationary, weather, satellite, images, are, primarily, used, for, short, term, and, real, time, forecasting, geostationary, satellites, can, be, used, to, augment, gnss, systems, by, relaying, clock, ephemeris, and, ionospheric, error, corrections, calculated, from, ground, stations, of, a, known, position, and, providing, an, additional, reference, signal, this, improves, position, accuracy, from, approximately, 5m, to, 1m, or, less, past, and, current, navigation, systems, that, use, geostationary, satellites, include, geostationary, satellites, are, launched, to, the, east, into, a, prograde, orbit, that, matches, the, rotation, rate, of, the, equator, the, smallest, inclination, that, a, satellite, can, be, launched, into, is, that, of, the, launch, site, s, latitude, so, launching, the, satellite, from, close, to, the, equator, limits, the, amount, of, inclination, change, needed, later, additionally, launching, from, close, to, the, equator, allows, the, speed, of, the, earth, s, rotation, to, give, the, satellite, a, boost, a, launch, site, should, have, water, or, deserts, to, the, east, so, any, failed, rockets, do, not, fall, on, a, populated, area, most, launch, vehicles, place, geostationary, satellites, directly, into, a, geostationary, transfer, orbit, gto, an, elliptical, orbit, with, an, apogee, at, geo, height, and, a, low, perigee, on, board, satellite, propulsion, is, then, used, to, raise, the, perigee, circularise, and, reach, geo, satellites, in, geostationary, orbit, must, all, occupy, a, single, ring, above, the, equator, the, requirement, to, space, these, satellites, apart, to, avoid, harmful, radio, frequency, interference, during, operations, means, that, there, are, a, limited, number, of, orbital, slots, available, and, thus, only, a, limited, number, of, satellites, can, be, operated, in, geostationary, orbit, this, has, led, to, conflict, between, different, countries, wishing, access, to, the, same, orbital, slots, countries, near, the, same, longitude, but, differing, latitudes, and, radio, frequencies, these, disputes, are, addressed, through, the, international, telecommunication, union, s, allocation, mechanism, under, the, radio, regulations, in, the, 1976, bogota, declaration, eight, countries, located, on, the, earth, s, equator, claimed, sovereignty, over, the, geostationary, orbits, above, their, territory, but, the, claims, gained, no, international, recognition, a, statite, is, a, hypothetical, satellite, that, uses, radiation, pressure, from, the, sun, against, a, solar, sail, to, modify, its, orbit, it, would, hold, its, location, over, the, dark, side, of, the, earth, at, a, latitude, of, approximately, 30, degrees, a, statite, is, stationary, relative, to, the, earth, and, sun, system, rather, than, compared, to, surface, of, the, earth, and, could, ease, congestion, in, the, geostationary, ring, geostationary, satellites, require, some, station, keeping, to, keep, their, position, and, once, they, run, out, of, thruster, fuel, they, are, generally, retired, the, transponders, and, other, onboard, systems, often, outlive, the, thruster, fuel, and, by, allowing, the, satellite, to, move, naturally, into, an, inclined, geosynchronous, orbit, some, satellites, can, remain, in, use, or, else, be, elevated, to, a, graveyard, orbit, this, process, is, becoming, increasingly, regulated, and, satellites, must, have, a, 90, chance, of, moving, over, 200, km, above, the, geostationary, belt, at, end, of, life, space, debris, at, geostationary, orbits, typically, has, a, lower, collision, speed, than, at, low, earth, orbit, leo, since, all, geo, satellites, orbit, in, the, same, plane, altitude, and, speed, however, the, presence, of, satellites, in, eccentric, orbits, allows, for, collisions, at, up, to, 4, km, s, although, a, collision, is, comparatively, unlikely, geo, satellites, have, a, limited, ability, to, avoid, any, debris, at, geosynchronous, altitude, objects, less, than, 10, cm, in, diameter, cannot, be, seen, from, the, earth, making, it, difficult, to, assess, their, prevalence, despite, efforts, to, reduce, risk, spacecraft, collisions, have, occurred, the, european, space, agency, telecom, satellite, olympus, 1, was, struck, by, a, meteoroid, on, august, 11, 1993, and, eventually, moved, to, a, graveyard, orbit, and, in, 2006, the, russian, express, am11, communications, satellite, was, struck, by, an, unknown, object, and, rendered, inoperable, although, its, engineers, had, enough, contact, time, with, the, satellite, to, send, it, into, a, graveyard, orbit, in, 2017, both, amc, 9, and, telkom, 1, broke, apart, from, an, unknown, cause, a, typical, geostationary, orbit, has, the, following, properties, an, inclination, of, zero, ensures, that, the, orbit, remains, over, the, equator, at, all, times, making, it, stationary, with, respect, to, latitude, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, ground, observer, and, in, the, earth, centered, earth, fixed, reference, frame, 122, the, orbital, period, is, equal, to, exactly, one, sidereal, day, this, means, that, the, satellite, will, return, to, the, same, point, above, the, earth, s, surface, every, sidereal, day, regardless, of, other, orbital, properties, for, a, geostationary, orbit, in, particular, it, ensures, that, it, holds, the, same, longitude, over, time, 121, this, orbital, period, t, is, directly, related, to, the, semi, major, axis, of, the, orbit, through, the, formula, where, the, eccentricity, is, zero, which, produces, a, circular, orbit, this, ensures, that, the, satellite, does, not, move, closer, or, further, away, from, the, earth, which, would, cause, it, to, track, backwards, and, forwards, across, the, sky, 122, a, geostationary, orbit, can, be, achieved, only, at, an, altitude, very, close, to, 35, 786, kilometres, 22, 236, miles, and, directly, above, the, equator, this, equates, to, an, orbital, speed, of, 3, 07, kilometres, per, second, 1, 91, miles, per, second, and, an, orbital, period, of, 1, 436, minutes, one, sidereal, day, this, ensures, that, the, satellite, will, match, the, earth, s, rotational, period, and, has, a, stationary, footprint, on, the, ground, all, geostationary, satellites, have, to, be, located, on, this, ring, a, combination, of, lunar, gravity, solar, gravity, and, the, flattening, of, the, earth, at, its, poles, causes, a, precession, motion, of, the, orbital, plane, of, any, geostationary, object, with, an, orbital, period, of, about, 53, years, and, an, initial, inclination, gradient, of, about, 0, 85, per, year, achieving, a, maximal, inclination, of, 15, after, 26, 5, years, 156, to, correct, for, this, perturbation, regular, orbital, stationkeeping, maneuvers, are, necessary, amounting, to, a, delta, v, of, approximately, 50, m, s, per, year, a, second, effect, to, be, taken, into, account, is, the, longitudinal, drift, caused, by, the, asymmetry, of, the, earth, the, equator, is, slightly, elliptical, equatorial, eccentricity, 156, there, are, two, stable, equilibrium, points, at, 75, 3, e, and, 108, w, and, two, corresponding, unstable, points, at, 165, 3, e, and, 14, 7, w, any, geostationary, object, placed, between, the, equilibrium, points, would, without, any, action, be, slowly, accelerated, towards, the, stable, equilibrium, position, causing, a, periodic, longitude, variation, the, correction, of, this, effect, requires, station, keeping, maneuvers, with, a, maximal, delta, v, of, about, 2, m, s, per, year, depending, on, the, desired, longitude, solar, wind, and, radiation, pressure, also, exert, small, forces, on, satellites, over, time, these, cause, them, to, slowly, drift, away, from, their, prescribed, orbits, in, the, absence, of, servicing, missions, from, the, earth, or, a, renewable, propulsion, method, the, consumption, of, thruster, propellant, for, station, keeping, places, a, limitation, on, the, lifetime, of, the, satellite, hall, effect, thrusters, which, are, currently, in, use, have, the, potential, to, prolong, the, service, life, of, a, satellite, by, providing, high, efficiency, electric, propulsion, for, circular, orbits, around, a, body, the, centripetal, force, required, to, maintain, the, orbit, f, c, is, equal, to, the, gravitational, force, acting, on, the, satellite, f, g, from, isaac, newton, s, universal, law, of, gravitation, where, f, g, is, the, gravitational, force, acting, between, two, objects, m, e, is, the, mass, of, the, earth, 5, 9736, 10, 24, kg, m, s, is, the, mass, of, the, satellite, r, is, the, distance, between, the, centers, of, their, masses, and, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, 6, 674, 28, 0, 000, 67, 10, 11, m, 3, kg, 1, s, 2, the, magnitude, of, the, acceleration, a, of, a, body, moving, in, a, circle, is, given, by, where, v, is, the, magnitude, of, the, velocity, i, e, the, speed, of, the, satellite, from, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, the, centripetal, force, f, c, is, given, by, as, f, c, f, g, so, that, replacing, v, with, the, equation, for, the, speed, of, an, object, moving, around, a, circle, produces, where, t, is, the, orbital, period, i, e, one, sidereal, day, and, is, equal, to, 86, 164, 090, 54, s, this, gives, an, equation, for, r, the, product, gm, e, is, known, with, much, greater, precision, than, either, factor, alone, it, is, known, as, the, geocentric, gravitational, constant, 398, 600, 4418, 0, 0008, km, 3, s, 2, hence, the, resulting, orbital, radius, is, 42, 164, kilometres, 26, 199, miles, subtracting, the, earth, s, equatorial, radius, 6, 378, kilometres, 3, 963, miles, gives, the, altitude, of, 35, 786, kilometres, 22, 236, miles, the, orbital, speed, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, angular, speed, by, the, orbital, radius, by, the, same, method, we, can, determine, the, orbital, altitude, for, any, similar, pair, of, bodies, including, the, areostationary, orbit, of, an, object, in, relation, to, mars, if, it, is, assumed, that, it, is, spherical, which, it, is, not, entirely, the, gravitational, constant, gm, for, mars, has, the, value, of, 42, 830, km, 3, s, 2, its, equatorial, radius, is, 3, 389, 50, km, and, the, known, rotational, period, t, of, the, planet, is, 1, 025, 956, 76, earth, days, 88, 642, 66, s, using, these, values, mars, orbital, altitude, is, equal, to, 17, 039, km, this, article, incorporates, public, domain, material, from, federal,
