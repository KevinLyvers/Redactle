clay, is, a, type, of, fine, grained, natural, soil, material, containing, clay, minerals, hydrous, aluminium, phyllosilicates, e, g, kaolinite, al, 2, si, 2, o, 5, oh, 4, most, pure, clay, minerals, are, white, or, light, coloured, but, natural, clays, show, a, variety, of, colours, from, impurities, such, as, a, reddish, or, brownish, colour, from, small, amounts, of, iron, oxide, clays, develop, plasticity, when, wet, but, can, be, hardened, through, firing, clay, is, the, longest, known, ceramic, material, prehistoric, humans, discovered, the, useful, properties, of, clay, and, used, it, for, making, pottery, some, of, the, earliest, pottery, shards, have, been, dated, to, around, 14, 000, bce, and, clay, tablets, were, the, first, known, writing, medium, clay, is, used, in, many, modern, industrial, processes, such, as, paper, making, cement, production, and, chemical, filtering, between, one, half, and, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, population, live, or, work, in, buildings, made, with, clay, often, baked, into, brick, as, an, essential, part, of, its, load, bearing, structure, clay, is, a, very, common, substance, shale, formed, largely, from, clay, is, the, most, common, sedimentary, rock, although, many, naturally, occurring, deposits, include, both, silts, and, clay, clays, are, distinguished, from, other, fine, grained, soils, by, differences, in, size, and, mineralogy, silts, which, are, fine, grained, soils, that, do, not, include, clay, minerals, tend, to, have, larger, particle, sizes, than, clays, mixtures, of, sand, silt, and, less, than, 40, clay, are, called, loam, soils, high, in, swelling, clays, expansive, clay, which, are, clay, minerals, that, readily, expand, in, volume, when, they, absorb, water, are, a, major, challenge, in, civil, engineering, the, defining, mechanical, property, of, clay, is, its, plasticity, when, wet, and, its, ability, to, harden, when, dried, or, fired, clays, show, a, broad, range, of, water, content, within, which, they, are, highly, plastic, from, a, minimum, water, content, called, the, plastic, limit, where, the, clay, is, just, moist, enough, to, mould, to, a, maximum, water, content, called, the, liquid, limit, where, the, moulded, clay, is, just, dry, enough, to, hold, its, shape, the, plastic, limit, of, kaolinite, clay, ranges, from, about, 36, to, 40, and, its, liquid, limit, ranges, from, about, 58, to, 72, high, quality, clay, is, also, tough, as, measured, by, the, amount, of, mechanical, work, required, to, roll, a, sample, of, clay, flat, its, toughness, reflects, a, high, degree, of, internal, cohesion, clay, has, a, high, content, of, clay, minerals, that, give, it, its, plasticity, clay, minerals, are, hydrous, aluminium, phyllosilicate, minerals, composed, of, aluminium, and, silicon, ions, bonded, into, tiny, thin, plates, by, interconnecting, oxygen, and, hydroxide, ions, these, plates, are, tough, but, flexible, and, in, moist, clay, they, adhere, to, each, other, the, resulting, aggregates, give, clay, the, cohesion, that, makes, it, plastic, in, kaolinite, clay, the, bonding, between, plates, is, provided, by, a, film, of, water, molecules, that, hydrogen, bond, the, plates, together, the, bonds, are, weak, enough, to, allow, the, plates, to, slip, past, each, other, when, the, clay, is, being, moulded, but, strong, enough, to, hold, the, plates, in, place, and, allow, the, moulded, clay, to, retain, its, shape, after, it, is, moulded, when, the, clay, is, dried, most, of, the, water, molecules, are, removed, and, the, plates, hydrogen, bond, directly, to, each, other, so, that, the, dried, clay, is, rigid, but, still, fragile, if, the, clay, is, moistened, again, it, will, once, more, become, plastic, when, the, clay, is, fired, to, the, earthenware, stage, a, dehydration, reaction, removes, additional, water, from, the, clay, causing, clay, plates, to, irreversibly, adhere, to, each, other, via, stronger, covalent, bonding, which, strengthens, the, material, the, clay, mineral, kaolinite, is, transformed, into, a, non, clay, material, metakaolin, which, remains, rigid, and, hard, if, moistened, again, further, firing, through, the, stoneware, and, porcelain, stages, further, recrystallizes, the, metakaolin, into, yet, stronger, minerals, such, as, mullite, the, tiny, size, and, plate, form, of, clay, particles, gives, clay, minerals, a, high, surface, area, in, some, clay, minerals, the, plates, carry, a, negative, electrical, charge, that, is, balanced, by, a, surrounding, layer, of, positive, ions, cations, such, as, sodium, potassium, or, calcium, if, the, clay, is, mixed, with, a, solution, containing, other, cations, these, can, swap, places, with, the, cations, in, the, layer, around, the, clay, particles, which, gives, clays, a, high, capacity, for, ion, exchange, the, chemistry, of, clay, minerals, including, their, capacity, to, retain, nutrient, cations, such, as, potassium, and, ammonium, is, important, to, soil, fertility, clay, is, a, common, component, of, sedimentary, rock, shale, is, formed, largely, from, clay, and, is, the, most, common, of, sedimentary, rocks, however, most, clay, deposits, are, impure, many, naturally, occurring, deposits, include, both, silts, and, clay, clays, are, distinguished, from, other, fine, grained, soils, by, differences, in, size, and, mineralogy, silts, which, are, fine, grained, soils, that, do, not, include, clay, minerals, tend, to, have, larger, particle, sizes, than, clays, there, is, however, some, overlap, in, particle, size, and, other, physical, properties, the, distinction, between, silt, and, clay, varies, by, discipline, geologists, and, soil, scientists, usually, consider, the, separation, to, occur, at, a, particle, size, of, 2, m, clays, being, finer, than, silts, sedimentologists, often, use, 4, 5, m, and, colloid, chemists, use, 1, m, clay, size, particles, and, clay, minerals, are, not, the, same, despite, a, degree, of, overlap, in, their, respective, definitions, geotechnical, engineers, distinguish, between, silts, and, clays, based, on, the, plasticity, properties, of, the, soil, as, measured, by, the, soils, atterberg, limits, iso, 14688, grades, clay, particles, as, being, smaller, than, 2, m, and, silt, particles, as, being, larger, mixtures, of, sand, silt, and, less, than, 40, clay, are, called, loam, some, clay, minerals, such, as, smectite, are, described, as, swelling, clay, minerals, because, they, have, a, great, capacity, to, take, up, water, and, they, increase, greatly, in, volume, when, they, do, so, when, dried, they, shrink, back, to, their, original, volume, this, produces, distinctive, textures, such, as, mudcracks, or, popcorn, texture, in, clay, deposits, soils, containing, swelling, clay, minerals, such, as, bentonite, pose, a, considerable, challenge, for, civil, engineering, because, swelling, clay, can, break, foundations, of, buildings, and, ruin, road, beds, clay, minerals, most, commonly, form, by, prolonged, chemical, weathering, of, silicate, bearing, rocks, they, can, also, form, locally, from, hydrothermal, activity, chemical, weathering, takes, place, largely, by, acid, hydrolysis, due, to, low, concentrations, of, carbonic, acid, dissolved, in, rainwater, or, released, by, plant, roots, the, acid, breaks, bonds, between, aluminium, and, oxygen, releasing, other, metal, ions, and, silica, as, a, gel, of, orthosilicic, acid, the, clay, minerals, formed, depend, on, the, composition, of, the, source, rock, and, the, climate, acid, weathering, of, feldspar, rich, rock, such, as, granite, in, warm, climates, tends, to, produce, kaolin, weathering, of, the, same, kind, of, rock, under, alkaline, conditions, produces, illite, smectite, forms, by, weathering, of, igneous, rock, under, alkaline, conditions, while, gibbsite, forms, by, intense, weathering, of, other, clay, minerals, there, are, two, types, of, clay, deposits, primary, and, secondary, primary, clays, form, as, residual, deposits, in, soil, and, remain, at, the, site, of, formation, secondary, clays, are, clays, that, have, been, transported, from, their, original, location, by, water, erosion, and, deposited, in, a, new, sedimentary, deposit, secondary, clay, deposits, are, typically, associated, with, very, low, energy, depositional, environments, such, as, large, lakes, and, marine, basins, the, main, groups, of, clays, include, kaolinite, montmorillonite, smectite, and, illite, chlorite, vermiculite, talc, and, pyrophyllite, are, sometimes, also, classified, as, clay, minerals, there, are, approximately, 30, different, types, of, pure, clays, in, these, categories, but, most, natural, clay, deposits, are, mixtures, of, these, different, types, along, with, other, weathered, minerals, clay, minerals, in, clays, are, most, easily, identified, using, x, ray, diffraction, rather, than, chemical, or, physical, tests, varve, or, varved, clay, is, clay, with, visible, annual, layers, that, are, formed, by, seasonal, deposition, of, those, layers, and, are, marked, by, differences, in, erosion, and, organic, content, this, type, of, deposit, is, common, in, former, glacial, lakes, when, fine, sediments, are, delivered, into, the, calm, waters, of, these, glacial, lake, basins, away, from, the, shoreline, they, settle, to, the, lake, bed, the, resulting, seasonal, layering, is, preserved, in, an, even, distribution, of, clay, sediment, banding, quick, clay, is, a, unique, type, of, marine, clay, indigenous, to, the, glaciated, terrains, of, norway, north, america, northern, ireland, and, sweden, it, is, a, highly, sensitive, clay, prone, to, liquefaction, and, has, been, involved, in, several, deadly, landslides, modelling, clay, is, used, in, art, and, handicraft, for, sculpting, clays, are, used, for, making, pottery, both, utilitarian, and, decorative, and, construction, products, such, as, bricks, walls, and, floor, tiles, different, types, of, clay, when, used, with, different, minerals, and, firing, conditions, are, used, to, produce, earthenware, stoneware, and, porcelain, prehistoric, humans, discovered, the, useful, properties, of, clay, some, of, the, earliest, pottery, shards, recovered, are, from, central, honshu, japan, they, are, associated, with, the, j, mon, culture, and, recovered, deposits, have, been, dated, to, around, 14, 000, bce, cooking, pots, art, objects, dishware, smoking, pipes, and, even, musical, instruments, such, as, the, ocarina, can, all, be, shaped, from, clay, before, being, fired, ancient, peoples, in, mesopotamia, adopted, clay, tablets, as, the, first, known, writing, medium, clay, was, chosen, due, to, the, local, material, being, easy, to, work, with, and, widely, available, scribes, wrote, on, the, tablets, by, inscribing, them, with, a, script, known, as, cuneiform, using, a, blunt, reed, called, a, stylus, which, effectively, produced, the, wedge, shaped, markings, of, their, writing, after, being, written, on, clay, tablets, could, be, reworked, into, fresh, tablets, and, reused, if, needed, or, fired, to, make, them, permanent, records, purpose, made, clay, balls, were, used, as, sling, ammunition, clay, is, used, in, many, industrial, processes, such, as, paper, making, cement, production, and, chemical, filtering, bentonite, clay, is, widely, used, as, a, mold, binder, in, the, manufacture, of, sand, castings, clay, is, a, common, filler, used, in, polymer, nanocomposites, it, can, reduce, the, cost, of, the, composite, as, well, as, impart, modified, behavior, increased, stiffness, decreased, permeability, decreased, electrical, conductivity, etc, traditional, uses, of, clay, as, medicine, go, back, to, prehistoric, times, an, example, is, armenian, bole, which, is, used, to, soothe, an, upset, stomach, some, animals, such, as, parrots, and, pigs, ingest, clay, for, similar, reasons, kaolin, clay, and, attapulgite, have, been, used, as, anti, diarrheal, medicines, clay, as, the, defining, ingredient, of, loam, is, one, of, the, oldest, building, materials, on, earth, among, other, ancient, naturally, occurring, geologic, materials, such, as, stone, and, organic, materials, like, wood, between, one, half, and, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, population, in, both, traditional, societies, as, well, as, developed, countries, still, live, or, work, in, buildings, made, with, clay, often, baked, into, brick, as, an, essential, part, of, their, load, bearing, structure, also, a, primary, ingredient, in, many, natural, building, techniques, clay, is, used, to, create, adobe, cob, cordwood, and, structures, and, building, elements, such, as, wattle, and, daub, clay, plaster, clay, render, case, clay, floors, and, clay, paints, and, ceramic, building, material, clay, was, used, as, a, mortar, in, brick, chimneys, and, stone, walls, where, protected, from, water, clay, relatively, impermeable, to, water, is, also, used, where, natural, seals, are, needed, such, as, in, pond, linings, the, cores, of, dams, or, as, a, barrier, in, landfills, against, toxic, seepage, lining, the, landfill, preferably, in, combination, with, geotextiles, studies, in, the, early, 21st, century, have, investigated, clay, s, absorption, capacities, in, various, applications, such, as, the, removal, of, heavy, metals, from, waste, water, and, air, purification
