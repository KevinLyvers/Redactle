nitrogen, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, n, and, atomic, number, 7, nitrogen, is, a, nonmetal, and, the, lightest, member, of, group, 15, of, the, periodic, table, often, called, the, pnictogens, it, is, a, common, element, in, the, universe, estimated, at, seventh, in, total, abundance, in, the, milky, way, and, the, solar, system, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, two, atoms, of, the, element, bond, to, form, n, 2, a, colorless, and, odorless, diatomic, gas, n, 2, forms, about, 78, of, earth, s, atmosphere, making, it, the, most, abundant, chemical, species, in, air, because, of, the, volatility, of, nitrogen, compounds, nitrogen, is, relatively, rare, in, the, solid, parts, of, the, earth, it, was, first, discovered, and, isolated, by, scottish, physician, daniel, rutherford, in, 1772, and, independently, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, and, henry, cavendish, at, about, the, same, time, the, name, nitrog, ne, was, suggested, by, french, chemist, jean, antoine, claude, chaptal, in, 1790, when, it, was, found, that, nitrogen, was, present, in, nitric, acid, and, nitrates, antoine, lavoisier, suggested, instead, the, name, azote, from, the, ancient, greek, no, life, as, it, is, an, asphyxiant, gas, this, name, is, used, in, a, number, of, languages, and, appears, in, the, english, names, of, some, nitrogen, compounds, such, as, hydrazine, azides, and, azo, compounds, elemental, nitrogen, is, usually, produced, from, air, by, pressure, swing, adsorption, technology, about, 2, 3, of, commercially, produced, elemental, nitrogen, is, used, as, an, inert, oxygen, free, gas, for, commercial, uses, such, as, food, packaging, and, much, of, the, rest, is, used, as, liquid, nitrogen, in, cryogenic, applications, many, industrially, important, compounds, such, as, ammonia, nitric, acid, organic, nitrates, propellants, and, explosives, and, cyanides, contain, nitrogen, the, extremely, strong, triple, bond, in, elemental, nitrogen, n, n, the, second, strongest, bond, in, any, diatomic, molecule, after, carbon, monoxide, co, dominates, nitrogen, chemistry, this, causes, difficulty, for, both, organisms, and, industry, in, converting, n, 2, into, useful, compounds, but, at, the, same, time, it, means, that, burning, exploding, or, decomposing, nitrogen, compounds, to, form, nitrogen, gas, releases, large, amounts, of, often, useful, energy, synthetically, produced, ammonia, and, nitrates, are, key, industrial, fertilisers, and, fertiliser, nitrates, are, key, pollutants, in, the, eutrophication, of, water, systems, apart, from, its, use, in, fertilisers, and, energy, stores, nitrogen, is, a, constituent, of, organic, compounds, as, diverse, as, aramids, used, in, high, strength, fabric, and, cyanoacrylate, used, in, superglue, nitrogen, occurs, in, all, organisms, primarily, in, amino, acids, and, thus, proteins, in, the, nucleic, acids, dna, and, rna, and, in, the, energy, transfer, molecule, adenosine, triphosphate, the, human, body, contains, about, 3, nitrogen, by, mass, the, fourth, most, abundant, element, in, the, body, after, oxygen, carbon, and, hydrogen, the, nitrogen, cycle, describes, the, movement, of, the, element, from, the, air, into, the, biosphere, and, organic, compounds, then, back, into, the, atmosphere, nitrogen, is, a, constituent, of, every, major, pharmacological, drug, class, including, antibiotics, many, drugs, are, mimics, or, prodrugs, of, natural, nitrogen, containing, signal, molecules, for, example, the, organic, nitrates, nitroglycerin, and, nitroprusside, control, blood, pressure, by, metabolizing, into, nitric, oxide, many, notable, nitrogen, containing, drugs, such, as, the, natural, caffeine, and, morphine, or, the, synthetic, amphetamines, act, on, receptors, of, animal, neurotransmitters, nitrogen, compounds, have, a, very, long, history, ammonium, chloride, having, been, known, to, herodotus, they, were, well, known, by, the, middle, ages, alchemists, knew, nitric, acid, as, aqua, fortis, strong, water, as, well, as, other, nitrogen, compounds, such, as, ammonium, salts, and, nitrate, salts, the, mixture, of, nitric, and, hydrochloric, acids, was, known, as, aqua, regia, royal, water, celebrated, for, its, ability, to, dissolve, gold, the, king, of, metals, the, discovery, of, nitrogen, is, attributed, to, the, scottish, physician, daniel, rutherford, in, 1772, who, called, it, noxious, air, though, he, did, not, recognise, it, as, an, entirely, different, chemical, substance, he, clearly, distinguished, it, from, joseph, black, s, fixed, air, or, carbon, dioxide, the, fact, that, there, was, a, component, of, air, that, does, not, support, combustion, was, clear, to, rutherford, although, he, was, not, aware, that, it, was, an, element, nitrogen, was, also, studied, at, about, the, same, time, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, henry, cavendish, and, joseph, priestley, who, referred, to, it, as, burnt, air, or, phlogisticated, air, french, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, referred, to, nitrogen, gas, as, mephitic, air, or, azote, from, the, greek, word, azotikos, no, life, due, to, it, being, asphyxiant, in, an, atmosphere, of, pure, nitrogen, animals, died, and, flames, were, extinguished, though, lavoisier, s, name, was, not, accepted, in, english, since, it, was, pointed, out, that, all, gases, but, oxygen, are, either, asphyxiant, or, outright, toxic, it, is, used, in, many, languages, french, italian, portuguese, polish, russian, albanian, turkish, etc, the, german, stickstoff, similarly, refers, to, the, same, characteristic, viz, ersticken, to, choke, or, suffocate, and, still, remains, in, english, in, the, common, names, of, many, nitrogen, compounds, such, as, hydrazine, and, compounds, of, the, azide, ion, finally, it, led, to, the, name, pnictogens, for, the, group, headed, by, nitrogen, from, the, greek, to, choke, the, english, word, nitrogen, 1794, entered, the, language, from, the, french, nitrog, ne, coined, in, 1790, by, french, chemist, jean, antoine, chaptal, 1756, 1832, from, the, french, nitre, potassium, nitrate, also, called, saltpeter, and, the, french, suffix, g, ne, producing, from, the, greek, genes, begotten, chaptal, s, meaning, was, that, nitrogen, is, the, essential, part, of, nitric, acid, which, in, turn, was, produced, from, nitre, in, earlier, times, niter, had, been, confused, with, egyptian, natron, sodium, carbonate, called, nitron, in, greek, which, despite, the, name, contained, no, nitrate, the, earliest, military, industrial, and, agricultural, applications, of, nitrogen, compounds, used, saltpeter, sodium, nitrate, or, potassium, nitrate, most, notably, in, gunpowder, and, later, as, fertiliser, in, 1910, lord, rayleigh, discovered, that, an, electrical, discharge, in, nitrogen, gas, produced, active, nitrogen, a, monatomic, allotrope, of, nitrogen, the, whirling, cloud, of, brilliant, yellow, light, produced, by, his, apparatus, reacted, with, mercury, to, produce, explosive, mercury, nitride, for, a, long, time, sources, of, nitrogen, compounds, were, limited, natural, sources, originated, either, from, biology, or, deposits, of, nitrates, produced, by, atmospheric, reactions, nitrogen, fixation, by, industrial, processes, like, the, frank, caro, process, 1895, 1899, and, haber, bosch, process, 1908, 1913, eased, this, shortage, of, nitrogen, compounds, to, the, extent, that, half, of, global, food, production, now, relies, on, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilisers, at, the, same, time, use, of, the, ostwald, process, 1902, to, produce, nitrates, from, industrial, nitrogen, fixation, allowed, the, large, scale, industrial, production, of, nitrates, as, feedstock, in, the, manufacture, of, explosives, in, the, world, wars, of, the, 20th, century, a, nitrogen, atom, has, seven, electrons, in, the, ground, state, they, are, arranged, in, the, electron, configuration, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 1, x, 2p, 1, y, 2p, 1, z, it, therefore, has, five, valence, electrons, in, the, 2s, and, 2p, orbitals, three, of, which, the, p, electrons, are, unpaired, it, has, one, of, the, highest, electronegativities, among, the, elements, 3, 04, on, the, pauling, scale, exceeded, only, by, chlorine, 3, 16, oxygen, 3, 44, and, fluorine, 3, 98, the, light, noble, gases, helium, neon, and, argon, would, presumably, also, be, more, electronegative, and, in, fact, are, on, the, allen, scale, following, periodic, trends, its, single, bond, covalent, radius, of, 71, pm, is, smaller, than, those, of, boron, 84, pm, and, carbon, 76, pm, while, it, is, larger, than, those, of, oxygen, 66, pm, and, fluorine, 57, pm, the, nitride, anion, n, 3, is, much, larger, at, 146, pm, similar, to, that, of, the, oxide, o, 2, 140, pm, and, fluoride, f, 133, pm, anions, the, first, three, ionisation, energies, of, nitrogen, are, 1, 402, 2, 856, and, 4, 577, mj, mol, 1, and, the, sum, of, the, fourth, and, fifth, is, 16, 920, mj, mol, 1, due, to, these, very, high, figures, nitrogen, has, no, simple, cationic, chemistry, the, lack, of, radial, nodes, in, the, 2p, subshell, is, directly, responsible, for, many, of, the, anomalous, properties, of, the, first, row, of, the, p, block, especially, in, nitrogen, oxygen, and, fluorine, the, 2p, subshell, is, very, small, and, has, a, very, similar, radius, to, the, 2s, shell, facilitating, orbital, hybridisation, it, also, results, in, very, large, electrostatic, forces, of, attraction, between, the, nucleus, and, the, valence, electrons, in, the, 2s, and, 2p, shells, resulting, in, very, high, electronegativities, hypervalency, is, almost, unknown, in, the, 2p, elements, for, the, same, reason, because, the, high, electronegativity, makes, it, difficult, for, a, small, nitrogen, atom, to, be, a, central, atom, in, an, electron, rich, three, center, four, electron, bond, since, it, would, tend, to, attract, the, electrons, strongly, to, itself, thus, despite, nitrogen, s, position, at, the, head, of, group, 15, in, the, periodic, table, its, chemistry, shows, huge, differences, from, that, of, its, heavier, congeners, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, nitrogen, may, be, usefully, compared, to, its, horizontal, neighbours, carbon, and, oxygen, as, well, as, its, vertical, neighbours, in, the, pnictogen, column, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, although, each, period, 2, element, from, lithium, to, oxygen, shows, some, similarities, to, the, period, 3, element, in, the, next, group, from, magnesium, to, chlorine, these, are, known, as, diagonal, relationships, their, degree, drops, off, abruptly, past, the, boron, silicon, pair, the, similarities, of, nitrogen, to, sulfur, are, mostly, limited, to, sulfur, nitride, ring, compounds, when, both, elements, are, the, only, ones, present, nitrogen, does, not, share, the, proclivity, of, carbon, for, catenation, like, carbon, nitrogen, tends, to, form, ionic, or, metallic, compounds, with, metals, nitrogen, forms, an, extensive, series, of, nitrides, with, carbon, including, those, with, chain, graphitic, and, fullerenic, like, structures, it, resembles, oxygen, with, its, high, electronegativity, and, concomitant, capability, for, hydrogen, bonding, and, the, ability, to, form, coordination, complexes, by, donating, its, lone, pairs, of, electrons, there, are, some, parallels, between, the, chemistry, of, ammonia, nh, 3, and, water, h, 2, o, for, example, the, capacity, of, both, compounds, to, be, protonated, to, give, nh, 4, and, h, 3, o, or, deprotonated, to, give, nh, 2, and, oh, with, all, of, these, able, to, be, isolated, in, solid, compounds, nitrogen, shares, with, both, its, horizontal, neighbours, a, preference, for, forming, multiple, bonds, typically, with, carbon, oxygen, or, other, nitrogen, atoms, through, p, p, interactions, thus, for, example, nitrogen, occurs, as, diatomic, molecules, and, therefore, has, very, much, lower, melting, 210, c, and, boiling, points, 196, c, than, the, rest, of, its, group, as, the, n, 2, molecules, are, only, held, together, by, weak, van, der, waals, interactions, and, there, are, very, few, electrons, available, to, create, significant, instantaneous, dipoles, this, is, not, possible, for, its, vertical, neighbours, thus, the, nitrogen, oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro, nitroso, azo, and, diazo, compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and, imino, derivatives, find, no, echo, with, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or, bismuth, by, the, same, token, however, the, complexity, of, the, phosphorus, oxoacids, finds, no, echo, with, nitrogen, setting, aside, their, differences, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, form, an, extensive, series, of, compounds, with, one, another, these, have, chain, ring, and, cage, structures, table, of, thermal, and, physical, properties, of, nitrogen, n, 2, at, atmospheric, pressure, nitrogen, has, two, stable, isotopes, 14, n, and, 15, n, the, first, is, much, more, common, making, up, 99, 634, of, natural, nitrogen, and, the, second, which, is, slightly, heavier, makes, up, the, remaining, 0, 366, this, leads, to, an, atomic, weight, of, around, 14, 007, u, both, of, these, stable, isotopes, are, produced, in, the, cno, cycle, in, stars, but, 14, n, is, more, common, as, its, proton, capture, is, the, rate, limiting, step, 14, n, is, one, of, the, five, stable, odd, odd, nuclides, a, nuclide, having, an, odd, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, the, other, four, are, 2, h, 6, li, 10, b, and, 180m, ta, the, relative, abundance, of, 14, n, and, 15, n, is, practically, constant, in, the, atmosphere, but, can, vary, elsewhere, due, to, natural, isotopic, fractionation, from, biological, redox, reactions, and, the, evaporation, of, natural, ammonia, or, nitric, acid, biologically, mediated, reactions, e, g, assimilation, nitrification, and, denitrification, strongly, control, nitrogen, dynamics, in, the, soil, these, reactions, typically, result, in, 15, n, enrichment, of, the, substrate, and, depletion, of, the, product, the, heavy, isotope, 15, n, was, first, discovered, by, s, m, naud, in, 1929, and, soon, after, heavy, isotopes, of, the, neighbouring, elements, oxygen, and, carbon, were, discovered, it, presents, one, of, the, lowest, thermal, neutron, capture, cross, sections, of, all, isotopes, it, is, frequently, used, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, spectroscopy, to, determine, the, structures, of, nitrogen, containing, molecules, due, to, its, fractional, nuclear, spin, of, one, half, which, offers, advantages, for, nmr, such, as, narrower, line, width, 14, n, though, also, theoretically, usable, has, an, integer, nuclear, spin, of, one, and, thus, has, a, quadrupole, moment, that, leads, to, wider, and, less, useful, spectra, 15, n, nmr, nevertheless, has, complications, not, encountered, in, the, more, common, 1, h, and, 13, c, nmr, spectroscopy, the, low, natural, abundance, of, 15, n, 0, 36, significantly, reduces, sensitivity, a, problem, which, is, only, exacerbated, by, its, low, gyromagnetic, ratio, only, 10, 14, that, of, 1, h, as, a, result, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, for, 1, h, is, about, 300, times, as, much, as, that, for, 15, n, at, the, same, magnetic, field, strength, this, may, be, somewhat, alleviated, by, isotopic, enrichment, of, 15, n, by, chemical, exchange, or, fractional, distillation, 15, n, enriched, compounds, have, the, advantage, that, under, standard, conditions, they, do, not, undergo, chemical, exchange, of, their, nitrogen, atoms, with, atmospheric, nitrogen, unlike, compounds, with, labelled, hydrogen, carbon, and, oxygen, isotopes, that, must, be, kept, away, from, the, atmosphere, the, 15, n, 14, n, ratio, is, commonly, used, in, stable, isotope, analysis, in, the, fields, of, geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology, and, paleoceanography, where, it, is, called, 15, n, of, the, thirteen, other, isotopes, produced, synthetically, ranging, from, 9, n, to, 23, n, 13, n, has, a, half, life, of, ten, minutes, and, the, remaining, isotopes, have, half, lives, less, than, eight, seconds, given, the, half, life, difference, 13, n, is, the, most, important, nitrogen, radioisotope, being, relatively, long, lived, enough, to, use, in, positron, emission, tomography, pet, although, its, half, life, is, still, short, and, thus, it, must, be, produced, at, the, venue, of, the, pet, for, example, in, a, cyclotron, via, proton, bombardment, of, 16, o, producing, 13, n, and, an, alpha, particle, the, radioisotope, 16, n, is, the, dominant, radionuclide, in, the, coolant, of, pressurised, water, reactors, or, boiling, water, reactors, during, normal, operation, it, is, produced, from, 16, o, in, water, via, an, n, p, reaction, in, which, the, 16, o, atom, captures, a, neutron, and, expels, a, proton, it, has, a, short, half, life, of, about, 7, 1, s, but, its, decay, back, to, 16, o, produces, high, energy, gamma, radiation, 5, to, 7, mev, because, of, this, access, to, the, primary, coolant, piping, in, a, pressurised, water, reactor, must, be, restricted, during, reactor, power, operation, it, is, a, sensitive, and, immediate, indicator, of, leaks, from, the, primary, coolant, system, to, the, secondary, steam, cycle, and, is, the, primary, means, of, detection, for, such, leaks, atomic, nitrogen, also, known, as, active, nitrogen, is, highly, reactive, being, a, triradical, with, three, unpaired, electrons, free, nitrogen, atoms, easily, react, with, most, elements, to, form, nitrides, and, even, when, two, free, nitrogen, atoms, collide, to, produce, an, excited, n, 2, molecule, they, may, release, so, much, energy, on, collision, with, even, such, stable, molecules, as, carbon, dioxide, and, water, to, cause, homolytic, fission, into, radicals, such, as, co, and, o, or, oh, and, h, atomic, nitrogen, is, prepared, by, passing, an, electric, discharge, through, nitrogen, gas, at, 0, 1, 2, mmhg, which, produces, atomic, nitrogen, along, with, a, peach, yellow, emission, that, fades, slowly, as, an, afterglow, for, several, minutes, even, after, the, discharge, terminates, given, the, great, reactivity, of, atomic, nitrogen, elemental, nitrogen, usually, occurs, as, molecular, n, 2, dinitrogen, this, molecule, is, a, colourless, odourless, and, tasteless, diamagnetic, gas, at, standard, conditions, it, melts, at, 210, c, and, boils, at, 196, c, dinitrogen, is, mostly, unreactive, at, room, temperature, but, it, will, nevertheless, react, with, lithium, metal, and, some, transition, metal, complexes, this, is, due, to, its, bonding, which, is, unique, among, the, diatomic, elements, at, standard, conditions, in, that, it, has, an, n, n, triple, bond, triple, bonds, have, short, bond, lengths, in, this, case, 109, 76, pm, and, high, dissociation, energies, in, this, case, 945, 41, kj, mol, and, are, thus, very, strong, explaining, dinitrogen, s, low, level, of, chemical, reactivity, other, nitrogen, oligomers, and, polymers, may, be, possible, if, they, could, be, synthesised, they, may, have, potential, applications, as, materials, with, a, very, high, energy, density, that, could, be, used, as, powerful, propellants, or, explosives, under, extremely, high, pressures, 1, 1, million, atm, and, high, temperatures, 2000, k, as, produced, in, a, diamond, anvil, cell, nitrogen, polymerises, into, the, single, bonded, cubic, gauche, crystal, structure, this, structure, is, similar, to, that, of, diamond, and, both, have, extremely, strong, covalent, bonds, resulting, in, its, nickname, nitrogen, diamond, at, atmospheric, pressure, molecular, nitrogen, condenses, liquefies, at, 77, k, 195, 79, c, and, freezes, at, 63, k, 210, 01, c, into, the, beta, hexagonal, close, packed, crystal, allotropic, form, below, 35, 4, k, 237, 6, c, nitrogen, assumes, the, cubic, crystal, allotropic, form, called, the, alpha, phase, liquid, nitrogen, a, colourless, fluid, resembling, water, in, appearance, but, with, 80, 8, of, the, density, the, density, of, liquid, nitrogen, at, its, boiling, point, is, 0, 808, g, ml, is, a, common, cryogen, solid, nitrogen, has, many, crystalline, modifications, it, forms, a, significant, dynamic, surface, coverage, on, pluto, and, outer, moons, of, the, solar, system, such, as, triton, even, at, the, low, temperatures, of, solid, nitrogen, it, is, fairly, volatile, and, can, sublime, to, form, an, atmosphere, or, condense, back, into, nitrogen, frost, it, is, very, weak, and, flows, in, the, form, of, glaciers, and, on, triton, geysers, of, nitrogen, gas, come, from, the, polar, ice, cap, region, the, first, example, of, a, dinitrogen, complex, to, be, discovered, was, 2, see, figure, at, right, and, soon, many, other, such, complexes, were, discovered, these, complexes, in, which, a, nitrogen, molecule, donates, at, least, one, lone, pair, of, electrons, to, a, central, metal, cation, illustrate, how, n, 2, might, bind, to, the, metal, s, in, nitrogenase, and, the, catalyst, for, the, haber, process, these, processes, involving, dinitrogen, activation, are, vitally, important, in, biology, and, in, the, production, of, fertilisers, dinitrogen, is, able, to, coordinate, to, metals, in, five, different, ways, the, more, well, characterised, ways, are, the, end, on, m, n, n, 1, and, m, n, n, m, bis, 1, in, which, the, lone, pairs, on, the, nitrogen, atoms, are, donated, to, the, metal, cation, the, less, well, characterised, ways, involve, dinitrogen, donating, electron, pairs, from, the, triple, bond, either, as, a, bridging, ligand, to, two, metal, cations, bis, 2, or, to, just, one, 2, the, fifth, and, unique, method, involves, triple, coordination, as, a, bridging, ligand, donating, all, three, electron, pairs, from, the, triple, bond, 3, n, 2, a, few, complexes, feature, multiple, n, 2, ligands, and, some, feature, n, 2, bonded, in, multiple, ways, since, n, 2, is, isoelectronic, with, carbon, monoxide, co, and, acetylene, c, 2, h, 2, the, bonding, in, dinitrogen, complexes, is, closely, allied, to, that, in, carbonyl, compounds, although, n, 2, is, a, weaker, donor, and, acceptor, than, co, theoretical, studies, show, that, donation, is, a, more, important, factor, allowing, the, formation, of, the, m, n, bond, than, back, donation, which, mostly, only, weakens, the, n, n, bond, and, end, on, 1, donation, is, more, readily, accomplished, than, side, on, 2, donation, today, dinitrogen, complexes, are, known, for, almost, all, the, transition, metals, accounting, for, several, hundred, compounds, they, are, normally, prepared, by, three, methods, occasionally, the, n, n, bond, may, be, formed, directly, within, a, metal, complex, for, example, by, directly, reacting, coordinated, ammonia, nh, 3, with, nitrous, acid, hno, 2, but, this, is, not, generally, applicable, most, dinitrogen, complexes, have, colours, within, the, range, white, yellow, orange, red, brown, a, few, exceptions, are, known, such, as, the, blue, nitrogen, bonds, to, almost, all, the, elements, in, the, periodic, table, except, the, first, two, noble, gases, helium, and, neon, and, some, of, the, very, short, lived, elements, after, bismuth, creating, an, immense, variety, of, binary, compounds, with, varying, properties, and, applications, many, binary, compounds, are, known, with, the, exception, of, the, nitrogen, hydrides, oxides, and, fluorides, these, are, typically, called, nitrides, many, stoichiometric, phases, are, usually, present, for, most, elements, e, g, mnn, mn, 6, n, 5, mn, 3, n, 2, mn, 2, n, mn, 4, n, and, mn, x, n, for, 9, 2, x, 25, 3, they, may, be, classified, as, salt, like, mostly, ionic, covalent, diamond, like, and, metallic, or, interstitial, although, this, classification, has, limitations, generally, stemming, from, the, continuity, of, bonding, types, instead, of, the, discrete, and, separate, types, that, it, implies, they, are, normally, prepared, by, directly, reacting, a, metal, with, nitrogen, or, ammonia, sometimes, after, heating, or, by, thermal, decomposition, of, metal, amides, many, variants, on, these, processes, are, possible, the, most, ionic, of, these, nitrides, are, those, of, the, alkali, metals, and, alkaline, earth, metals, li, 3, n, na, k, rb, and, cs, do, not, form, stable, nitrides, for, steric, reasons, and, m, 3, n, 2, m, be, mg, ca, sr, ba, these, can, formally, be, thought, of, as, salts, of, the, n, 3, anion, although, charge, separation, is, not, actually, complete, even, for, these, highly, electropositive, elements, however, the, alkali, metal, azides, nan, 3, and, kn, 3, featuring, the, linear, n, 3, anion, are, well, known, as, are, sr, n, 3, 2, and, ba, n, 3, 2, azides, of, the, b, subgroup, metals, those, in, groups, 11, through, 16, are, much, less, ionic, have, more, complicated, structures, and, detonate, readily, when, shocked, many, covalent, binary, nitrides, are, known, examples, include, cyanogen, cn, 2, triphosphorus, pentanitride, p, 3, n, 5, disulfur, dinitride, s, 2, n, 2, and, tetrasulfur, tetranitride, s, 4, n, 4, the, essentially, covalent, silicon, nitride, si, 3, n, 4, and, germanium, nitride, ge, 3, n, 4, are, also, known, silicon, nitride, in, particular, would, make, a, promising, ceramic, if, not, for, the, difficulty, of, working, with, and, sintering, it, in, particular, the, group, 13, nitrides, most, of, which, are, promising, semiconductors, are, isoelectronic, with, graphite, diamond, and, silicon, carbide, and, have, similar, structures, their, bonding, changes, from, covalent, to, partially, ionic, to, metallic, as, the, group, is, descended, in, particular, since, the, b, n, unit, is, isoelectronic, to, c, c, and, carbon, is, essentially, intermediate, in, size, between, boron, and, nitrogen, much, of, organic, chemistry, finds, an, echo, in, boron, nitrogen, chemistry, such, as, in, borazine, inorganic, benzene, nevertheless, the, analogy, is, not, exact, due, to, the, ease, of, nucleophilic, attack, at, boron, due, to, its, deficiency, in, electrons, which, is, not, possible, in, a, wholly, carbon, containing, ring, the, largest, category, of, nitrides, are, the, interstitial, nitrides, of, formulae, mn, m, 2, n, and, m, 4, n, although, variable, composition, is, perfectly, possible, where, the, small, nitrogen, atoms, are, positioned, in, the, gaps, in, a, metallic, cubic, or, hexagonal, close, packed, lattice, they, are, opaque, very, hard, and, chemically, inert, melting, only, at, very, high, temperatures, generally, over, 2500, c, they, have, a, metallic, lustre, and, conduct, electricity, as, do, metals, they, hydrolyse, only, very, slowly, to, give, ammonia, or, nitrogen, the, nitride, anion, n, 3, is, the, strongest, donor, known, among, ligands, the, second, strongest, is, o, 2, nitrido, complexes, are, generally, made, by, the, thermal, decomposition, of, azides, or, by, deprotonating, ammonia, and, they, usually, involve, a, terminal, n, 3, group, the, linear, azide, anion, n, 3, being, isoelectronic, with, nitrous, oxide, carbon, dioxide, and, cyanate, forms, many, coordination, complexes, further, catenation, is, rare, although, n, 4, 4, isoelectronic, with, carbonate, and, nitrate, is, known, industrially, ammonia, nh, 3, is, the, most, important, compound, of, nitrogen, and, is, prepared, in, larger, amounts, than, any, other, compound, because, it, contributes, significantly, to, the, nutritional, needs, of, terrestrial, organisms, by, serving, as, a, precursor, to, food, and, fertilisers, it, is, a, colourless, alkaline, gas, with, a, characteristic, pungent, smell, the, presence, of, hydrogen, bonding, has, very, significant, effects, on, ammonia, conferring, on, it, its, high, melting, 78, c, and, boiling, 33, c, points, as, a, liquid, it, is, a, very, good, solvent, with, a, high, heat, of, vaporisation, enabling, it, to, be, used, in, vacuum, flasks, that, also, has, a, low, viscosity, and, electrical, conductivity, and, high, dielectric, constant, and, is, less, dense, than, water, however, the, hydrogen, bonding, in, nh, 3, is, weaker, than, that, in, h, 2, o, due, to, the, lower, electronegativity, of, nitrogen, compared, to, oxygen, and, the, presence, of, only, one, lone, pair, in, nh, 3, rather, than, two, in, h, 2, o, it, is, a, weak, base, in, aqueous, solution, p, k, b, 4, 74, its, conjugate, acid, is, ammonium, nh, 4, it, can, also, act, as, an, extremely, weak, acid, losing, a, proton, to, produce, the, amide, anion, nh, 2, it, thus, undergoes, self, dissociation, similar, to, water, to, produce, ammonium, and, amide, ammonia, burns, in, air, or, oxygen, though, not, readily, to, produce, nitrogen, gas, it, burns, in, fluorine, with, a, greenish, yellow, flame, to, give, nitrogen, trifluoride, reactions, with, the, other, nonmetals, are, very, complex, and, tend, to, lead, to, a, mixture, of, products, ammonia, reacts, on, heating, with, metals, to, give, nitrides, many, other, binary, nitrogen, hydrides, are, known, but, the, most, important, are, hydrazine, n, 2, h, 4, and, hydrogen, azide, hn, 3, although, it, is, not, a, nitrogen, hydride, hydroxylamine, nh, 2, oh, is, similar, in, properties, and, structure, to, ammonia, and, hydrazine, as, well, hydrazine, is, a, fuming, colourless, liquid, that, smells, similar, to, ammonia, its, physical, properties, are, very, similar, to, those, of, water, melting, point, 2, 0, c, boiling, point, 113, 5, c, density, 1, 00, g, cm, 3, despite, it, being, an, endothermic, compound, it, is, kinetically, stable, it, burns, quickly, and, completely, in, air, very, exothermically, to, give, nitrogen, and, water, vapour, it, is, a, very, useful, and, versatile, reducing, agent, and, is, a, weaker, base, than, ammonia, it, is, also, commonly, used, as, a, rocket, fuel, hydrazine, is, generally, made, by, reaction, of, ammonia, with, alkaline, sodium, hypochlorite, in, the, presence, of, gelatin, or, glue, the, attacks, by, hydroxide, and, ammonia, may, be, reversed, thus, passing, through, the, intermediate, nhcl, instead, the, reason, for, adding, gelatin, is, that, it, removes, metal, ions, such, as, cu, 2, that, catalyses, the, destruction, of, hydrazine, by, reaction, with, monochloramine, nh, 2, cl, to, produce, ammonium, chloride, and, nitrogen, hydrogen, azide, hn, 3, was, first, produced, in, 1890, by, the, oxidation, of, aqueous, hydrazine, by, nitrous, acid, it, is, very, explosive, and, even, dilute, solutions, can, be, dangerous, it, has, a, disagreeable, and, irritating, smell, and, is, a, potentially, lethal, but, not, cumulative, poison, it, may, be, considered, the, conjugate, acid, of, the, azide, anion, and, is, similarly, analogous, to, the, hydrohalic, acids, all, four, simple, nitrogen, trihalides, are, known, a, few, mixed, halides, and, hydrohalides, are, known, but, are, mostly, unstable, examples, include, nclf, 2, ncl, 2, f, nbrf, 2, nf, 2, h, nfh, 2, ncl, 2, h, and, nclh, 2, nitrogen, trifluoride, nf, 3, first, prepared, in, 1928, is, a, colourless, and, odourless, gas, that, is, thermodynamically, stable, and, most, readily, produced, by, the, electrolysis, of, molten, ammonium, fluoride, dissolved, in, anhydrous, hydrogen, fluoride, like, carbon, tetrafluoride, it, is, not, at, all, reactive, and, is, stable, in, water, or, dilute, aqueous, acids, or, alkalis, only, when, heated, does, it, act, as, a, fluorinating, agent, and, it, reacts, with, copper, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, on, contact, at, high, temperatures, to, give, tetrafluorohydrazine, n, 2, f, 4, the, cations, nf, 4, and, n, 2, f, 3, are, also, known, the, latter, from, reacting, tetrafluorohydrazine, with, strong, fluoride, acceptors, such, as, arsenic, pentafluoride, as, is, onf, 3, which, has, aroused, interest, due, to, the, short, n, o, distance, implying, partial, double, bonding, and, the, highly, polar, and, long, n, f, bond, tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike, hydrazine, itself, can, dissociate, at, room, temperature, and, above, to, give, the, radical, nf, 2, fluorine, azide, fn, 3, is, very, explosive, and, thermally, unstable, dinitrogen, difluoride, n, 2, f, 2, exists, as, thermally, interconvertible, cis, and, trans, isomers, and, was, first, found, as, a, product, of, the, thermal, decomposition, of, fn, 3, nitrogen, trichloride, ncl, 3, is, a, dense, volatile, and, explosive, liquid, whose, physical, properties, are, similar, to, those, of, carbon, tetrachloride, although, one, difference, is, that, ncl, 3, is, easily, hydrolysed, by, water, while, ccl, 4, is, not, it, was, first, synthesised, in, 1811, by, pierre, louis, dulong, who, lost, three, fingers, and, an, eye, to, its, explosive, tendencies, as, a, dilute, gas, it, is, less, dangerous, and, is, thus, used, industrially, to, bleach, and, sterilise, flour, nitrogen, tribromide, nbr, 3, first, prepared, in, 1975, is, a, deep, red, temperature, sensitive, volatile, solid, that, is, explosive, even, at, 100, c, nitrogen, triiodide, ni, 3, is, still, more, unstable, and, was, only, prepared, in, 1990, its, adduct, with, ammonia, which, was, known, earlier, is, very, shock, sensitive, it, can, be, set, off, by, the, touch, of, a, feather, shifting, air, currents, or, even, alpha, particles, for, this, reason, small, amounts, of, nitrogen, triiodide, are, sometimes, synthesised, as, a, demonstration, to, high, school, chemistry, students, or, as, an, act, of, chemical, magic, chlorine, azide, cln, 3, and, bromine, azide, brn, 3, are, extremely, sensitive, and, explosive, two, series, of, nitrogen, oxohalides, are, known, the, nitrosyl, halides, xno, and, the, nitryl, halides, xno, 2, the, first, is, very, reactive, gases, that, can, be, made, by, directly, halogenating, nitrous, oxide, nitrosyl, fluoride, nof, is, colourless, and, a, vigorous, fluorinating, agent, nitrosyl, chloride, nocl, behaves, in, much, the, same, way, and, has, often, been, used, as, an, ionising, solvent, nitrosyl, bromide, nobr, is, red, the, reactions, of, the, nitryl, halides, are, mostly, similar, nitryl, fluoride, fno, 2, and, nitryl, chloride, clno, 2, are, likewise, reactive, gases, and, vigorous, halogenating, agents, nitrogen, forms, nine, molecular, oxides, some, of, which, were, the, first, gases, to, be, identified, n, 2, o, nitrous, oxide, no, nitric, oxide, n, 2, o, 3, dinitrogen, trioxide, no, 2, nitrogen, dioxide, n, 2, o, 4, dinitrogen, tetroxide, n, 2, o, 5, dinitrogen, pentoxide, n, 4, o, nitrosylazide, and, n, no, 2, 3, trinitramide, all, are, thermally, unstable, towards, decomposition, to, their, elements, one, other, possible, oxide, that, has, not, yet, been, synthesised, is, oxatetrazole, n, 4, o, an, aromatic, ring, nitrous, oxide, n, 2, o, better, known, as, laughing, gas, is, made, by, thermal, decomposition, of, molten, ammonium, nitrate, at, 250, c, this, is, a, redox, reaction, and, thus, nitric, oxide, and, nitrogen, are, also, produced, as, byproducts, it, is, mostly, used, as, a, propellant, and, aerating, agent, for, sprayed, canned, whipped, cream, and, was, formerly, commonly, used, as, an, anaesthetic, despite, appearances, it, cannot, be, considered, to, be, the, anhydride, of, hyponitrous, acid, h, 2, n, 2, o, 2, because, that, acid, is, not, produced, by, the, dissolution, of, nitrous, oxide, in, water, it, is, rather, unreactive, not, reacting, with, the, halogens, the, alkali, metals, or, ozone, at, room, temperature, although, reactivity, increases, upon, heating, and, has, the, unsymmetrical, structure, n, n, o, n, n, o, n, n, o, above, 600, c, it, dissociates, by, breaking, the, weaker, n, o, bond, nitric, oxide, no, is, the, simplest, stable, molecule, with, an, odd, number, of, electrons, in, mammals, including, humans, it, is, an, important, cellular, signaling, molecule, involved, in, many, physiological, and, pathological, processes, it, is, formed, by, catalytic, oxidation, of, ammonia, it, is, a, colourless, paramagnetic, gas, that, being, thermodynamically, unstable, decomposes, to, nitrogen, and, oxygen, gas, at, 1100, 1200, c, its, bonding, is, similar, to, that, in, nitrogen, but, one, extra, electron, is, added, to, a, antibonding, orbital, and, thus, the, bond, order, has, been, reduced, to, approximately, 2, 5, hence, dimerisation, to, o, n, n, o, is, unfavourable, except, below, the, boiling, point, where, the, cis, isomer, is, more, stable, because, it, does, not, actually, increase, the, total, bond, order, and, because, the, unpaired, electron, is, delocalised, across, the, no, molecule, granting, it, stability, there, is, also, evidence, for, the, asymmetric, red, dimer, o, n, o, n, when, nitric, oxide, is, condensed, with, polar, molecules, it, reacts, with, oxygen, to, give, brown, nitrogen, dioxide, and, with, halogens, to, give, nitrosyl, halides, it, also, reacts, with, transition, metal, compounds, to, give, nitrosyl, complexes, most, of, which, are, deeply, coloured, blue, dinitrogen, trioxide, n, 2, o, 3, is, only, available, as, a, solid, because, it, rapidly, dissociates, above, its, melting, point, to, give, nitric, oxide, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, and, dinitrogen, tetroxide, n, 2, o, 4, the, latter, two, compounds, are, somewhat, difficult, to, study, individually, because, of, the, equilibrium, between, them, although, sometimes, dinitrogen, tetroxide, can, react, by, heterolytic, fission, to, nitrosonium, and, nitrate, in, a, medium, with, high, dielectric, constant, nitrogen, dioxide, is, an, acrid, corrosive, brown, gas, both, compounds, may, be, easily, prepared, by, decomposing, a, dry, metal, nitrate, both, react, with, water, to, form, nitric, acid, dinitrogen, tetroxide, is, very, useful, for, the, preparation, of, anhydrous, metal, nitrates, and, nitrato, complexes, and, it, became, the, storable, oxidiser, of, choice, for, many, rockets, in, both, the, united, states, and, ussr, by, the, late, 1950s, this, is, because, it, is, a, hypergolic, propellant, in, combination, with, a, hydrazine, based, rocket, fuel, and, can, be, easily, stored, since, it, is, liquid, at, room, temperature, the, thermally, unstable, and, very, reactive, dinitrogen, pentoxide, n, 2, o, 5, is, the, anhydride, of, nitric, acid, and, can, be, made, from, it, by, dehydration, with, phosphorus, pentoxide, it, is, of, interest, for, the, preparation, of, explosives, it, is, a, deliquescent, colourless, crystalline, solid, that, is, sensitive, to, light, in, the, solid, state, it, is, ionic, with, structure, as, a, gas, and, in, solution, it, is, molecular, o, 2, n, o, no, 2, hydration, to, nitric, acid, comes, readily, as, does, analogous, reaction, with, hydrogen, peroxide, giving, peroxonitric, acid, hoono, 2, it, is, a, violent, oxidising, agent, gaseous, dinitrogen, pentoxide, decomposes, as, follows, many, nitrogen, oxoacids, are, known, though, most, of, them, are, unstable, as, pure, compounds, and, are, known, only, as, aqueous, solutions, or, as, salts, hyponitrous, acid, h, 2, n, 2, o, 2, is, a, weak, diprotic, acid, with, the, structure, hon, noh, p, k, a1, 6, 9, p, k, a2, 11, 6, acidic, solutions, are, quite, stable, but, above, ph, 4, base, catalysed, decomposition, occurs, via, to, nitrous, oxide, and, the, hydroxide, anion, hyponitrites, involving, the, n, 2, o, 2, 2, anion, are, stable, to, reducing, agents, and, more, commonly, act, as, reducing, agents, themselves, they, are, an, intermediate, step, in, the, oxidation, of, ammonia, to, nitrite, which, occurs, in, the, nitrogen, cycle, hyponitrite, can, act, as, a, bridging, or, chelating, bidentate, ligand, nitrous, acid, hno, 2, is, not, known, as, a, pure, compound, but, is, a, common, component, in, gaseous, equilibria, and, is, an, important, aqueous, reagent, its, aqueous, solutions, may, be, made, from, acidifying, cool, aqueous, nitrite, no, 2, bent, solutions, although, already, at, room, temperature, disproportionation, to, nitrate, and, nitric, oxide, is, significant, it, is, a, weak, acid, with, p, k, a, 3, 35, at, 18, c, they, may, be, titrimetrically, analysed, by, their, oxidation, to, nitrate, by, permanganate, they, are, readily, reduced, to, nitrous, oxide, and, nitric, oxide, by, sulfur, dioxide, to, hyponitrous, acid, with, tin, ii, and, to, ammonia, with, hydrogen, sulfide, salts, of, hydrazinium, n, 2, h, 5, react, with, nitrous, acid, to, produce, azides, which, further, react, to, give, nitrous, oxide, and, nitrogen, sodium, nitrite, is, mildly, toxic, in, concentrations, above, 100, mg, kg, but, small, amounts, are, often, used, to, cure, meat, and, as, a, preservative, to, avoid, bacterial, spoilage, it, is, also, used, to, synthesise, hydroxylamine, and, to, diazotise, primary, aromatic, amines, as, follows, nitrite, is, also, a, common, ligand, that, can, coordinate, in, five, ways, the, most, common, are, nitro, bonded, from, the, nitrogen, and, nitrito, bonded, from, an, oxygen, nitro, nitrito, isomerism, is, common, where, the, nitrito, form, is, usually, less, stable, nitric, acid, hno, 3, is, by, far, the, most, important, and, the, most, stable, of, the, nitrogen, oxoacids, it, is, one, of, the, three, most, used, acids, the, other, two, being, sulfuric, acid, and, hydrochloric, acid, and, was, first, discovered, by, alchemists, in, the, 13th, century, it, is, made, by, the, catalytic, oxidation, of, ammonia, to, nitric, oxide, which, is, oxidised, to, nitrogen, dioxide, and, then, dissolved, in, water, to, give, concentrated, nitric, acid, in, the, united, states, of, america, over, seven, million, tonnes, of, nitric, acid, are, produced, every, year, most, of, which, is, used, for, nitrate, production, for, fertilisers, and, explosives, among, other, uses, anhydrous, nitric, acid, may, be, made, by, distilling, concentrated, nitric, acid, with, phosphorus, pentoxide, at, low, pressure, in, glass, apparatus, in, the, dark, it, can, only, be, made, in, the, solid, state, because, upon, melting, it, spontaneously, decomposes, to, nitrogen, dioxide, and, liquid, nitric, acid, undergoes, self, ionisation, to, a, larger, extent, than, any, other, covalent, liquid, as, follows, two, hydrates, hno, 3, h, 2, o, and, hno, 3, 3h, 2, o, are, known, that, can, be, crystallised, it, is, a, strong, acid, and, concentrated, solutions, are, strong, oxidising, agents, though, gold, platinum, rhodium, and, iridium, are, immune, to, attack, a, 3, 1, mixture, of, concentrated, hydrochloric, acid, and, nitric, acid, called, aqua, regia, is, still, stronger, and, successfully, dissolves, gold, and, platinum, because, free, chlorine, and, nitrosyl, chloride, are, formed, and, chloride, anions, can, form, strong, complexes, in, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, nitric, acid, is, protonated, to, form, nitronium, which, can, act, as, an, electrophile, for, aromatic, nitration, the, thermal, stabilities, of, nitrates, involving, the, trigonal, planar, no, 3, anion, depends, on, the, basicity, of, the, metal, and, so, do, the, products, of, decomposition, thermolysis, which, can, vary, between, the, nitrite, for, example, sodium, the, oxide, potassium, and, lead, or, even, the, metal, itself, silver, depending, on, their, relative, stabilities, nitrate, is, also, a, common, ligand, with, many, modes, of, coordination, finally, although, orthonitric, acid, h, 3, no, 4, which, would, be, analogous, to, orthophosphoric, acid, does, not, exist, the, tetrahedral, orthonitrate, anion, no, 3, 4, is, known, in, its, sodium, and, potassium, salts, these, white, crystalline, salts, are, very, sensitive, to, water, vapour, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, air, despite, its, limited, chemistry, the, orthonitrate, anion, is, interesting, from, a, structural, point, of, view, due, to, its, regular, tetrahedral, shape, and, the, short, n, o, bond, lengths, implying, significant, polar, character, to, the, bonding, nitrogen, is, one, of, the, most, important, elements, in, organic, chemistry, many, organic, functional, groups, involve, a, carbon, nitrogen, bond, such, as, amides, rconr, 2, amines, r, 3, n, imines, rc, nr, r, imides, rco, 2, nr, azides, rn, 3, azo, compounds, rn, 2, r, cyanates, rocn, isocyanates, rnco, nitrates, rono, 2, nitriles, rcn, isonitriles, rnc, nitrites, rono, nitro, compounds, rno, 2, nitroso, compounds, rno, oximes, rc, noh, r, and, pyridine, derivatives, c, n, bonds, are, strongly, polarised, towards, nitrogen, in, these, compounds, nitrogen, is, usually, trivalent, though, it, can, be, tetravalent, in, quaternary, ammonium, salts, r, 4, n, with, a, lone, pair, that, can, confer, basicity, on, the, compound, by, being, coordinated, to, a, proton, this, may, be, offset, by, other, factors, for, example, amides, are, not, basic, because, the, lone, pair, is, delocalised, into, a, double, bond, though, they, may, act, as, bases, at, very, low, ph, being, protonated, at, the, oxygen, and, pyrrole, is, not, basic, because, the, lone, pair, is, delocalised, as, part, of, an, aromatic, ring, the, amount, of, nitrogen, in, a, chemical, substance, can, be, determined, by, the, kjeldahl, method, in, particular, nitrogen, is, an, essential, component, of, nucleic, acids, amino, acids, and, thus, proteins, and, the, energy, carrying, molecule, adenosine, triphosphate, and, is, thus, vital, to, all, life, on, earth, nitrogen, is, the, most, common, pure, element, in, the, earth, making, up, 78, 1, of, the, volume, of, the, atmosphere, 75, 5, by, mass, around, 3, 89, million, gigatonnes, 3, 89, 10, 15, kg, despite, this, it, is, not, very, abundant, in, earth, s, crust, making, up, somewhere, around, 19, parts, per, million, of, this, on, par, with, niobium, gallium, and, lithium, this, represents, 300, 000, to, a, million, gigatonnes, of, nitrogen, depending, on, the, mass, of, the, crust, the, only, important, nitrogen, minerals, are, nitre, potassium, nitrate, saltpetre, and, soda, nitre, sodium, nitrate, chilean, saltpetre, however, these, have, not, been, an, important, source, of, nitrates, since, the, 1920s, when, the, industrial, synthesis, of, ammonia, and, nitric, acid, became, common, nitrogen, compounds, constantly, interchange, between, the, atmosphere, and, living, organisms, nitrogen, must, first, be, processed, or, fixed, into, a, plant, usable, form, usually, ammonia, some, nitrogen, fixation, is, done, by, lightning, strikes, producing, the, nitrogen, oxides, but, most, is, done, by, diazotrophic, bacteria, through, enzymes, known, as, nitrogenases, although, today, industrial, nitrogen, fixation, to, ammonia, is, also, significant, when, the, ammonia, is, taken, up, by, plants, it, is, used, to, synthesise, proteins, these, plants, are, then, digested, by, animals, who, use, the, nitrogen, compounds, to, synthesise, their, proteins, and, excrete, nitrogen, bearing, waste, finally, these, organisms, die, and, decompose, undergoing, bacterial, and, environmental, oxidation, and, denitrification, returning, free, dinitrogen, to, the, atmosphere, industrial, nitrogen, fixation, by, the, haber, process, is, mostly, used, as, fertiliser, although, excess, nitrogen, bearing, waste, when, leached, leads, to, eutrophication, of, freshwater, and, the, creation, of, marine, dead, zones, as, nitrogen, driven, bacterial, growth, depletes, water, oxygen, to, the, point, that, all, higher, organisms, die, furthermore, nitrous, oxide, which, is, produced, during, denitrification, attacks, the, atmospheric, ozone, layer, many, saltwater, fish, manufacture, large, amounts, of, trimethylamine, oxide, to, protect, them, from, the, high, osmotic, effects, of, their, environment, conversion, of, this, compound, to, dimethylamine, is, responsible, for, the, early, odour, in, unfresh, saltwater, fish, in, animals, free, radical, nitric, oxide, derived, from, an, amino, acid, serves, as, an, important, regulatory, molecule, for, circulation, nitric, oxide, s, rapid, reaction, with, water, in, animals, results, in, the, production, of, its, metabolite, nitrite, animal, metabolism, of, nitrogen, in, proteins, in, general, results, in, the, excretion, of, urea, while, animal, metabolism, of, nucleic, acids, results, in, the, excretion, of, urea, and, uric, acid, the, characteristic, odour, of, animal, flesh, decay, is, caused, by, the, creation, of, long, chain, nitrogen, containing, amines, such, as, putrescine, and, cadaverine, which, are, breakdown, products, of, the, amino, acids, ornithine, and, lysine, respectively, in, decaying, proteins, nitrogen, gas, is, an, industrial, gas, produced, by, the, fractional, distillation, of, liquid, air, or, by, mechanical, means, using, gaseous, air, pressurised, reverse, osmosis, membrane, or, pressure, swing, adsorption, nitrogen, gas, generators, using, membranes, or, pressure, swing, adsorption, psa, are, typically, more, cost, and, energy, efficient, than, bulk, delivered, nitrogen, commercial, nitrogen, is, often, a, byproduct, of, air, processing, for, industrial, concentration, of, oxygen, for, steelmaking, and, other, purposes, when, supplied, compressed, in, cylinders, it, is, often, called, ofn, oxygen, free, nitrogen, commercial, grade, nitrogen, already, contains, at, most, 20, ppm, oxygen, and, specially, purified, grades, containing, at, most, 2, ppm, oxygen, and, 10, ppm, argon, are, also, available, in, a, chemical, laboratory, it, is, prepared, by, treating, an, aqueous, solution, of, ammonium, chloride, with, sodium, nitrite, small, amounts, of, the, impurities, no, and, hno, 3, are, also, formed, in, this, reaction, the, impurities, can, be, removed, by, passing, the, gas, through, aqueous, sulfuric, acid, containing, potassium, dichromate, it, can, also, be, obtained, by, the, thermal, decomposition, of, ammonium, dichromate, very, pure, nitrogen, can, be, prepared, by, the, thermal, decomposition, of, barium, azide, or, sodium, azide, the, applications, of, nitrogen, compounds, are, naturally, extremely, widely, varied, due, to, the, huge, size, of, this, class, hence, only, applications, of, pure, nitrogen, itself, will, be, considered, here, two, thirds, 2, 3, of, nitrogen, produced, by, industry, is, sold, as, gas, and, the, remaining, one, third, 1, 3, as, a, liquid, the, gas, is, mostly, used, as, a, low, reactivity, safe, atmosphere, wherever, the, oxygen, in, the, air, would, pose, a, fire, explosion, or, oxidising, hazard, some, examples, include, nitrogen, is, commonly, used, during, sample, preparation, in, chemical, analysis, it, is, used, to, concentrate, and, reduce, the, volume, of, liquid, samples, directing, a, pressurised, stream, of, nitrogen, gas, perpendicular, to, the, surface, of, the, liquid, causes, the, solvent, to, evaporate, while, leaving, the, solute, s, and, un, evaporated, solvent, behind, nitrogen, can, be, used, as, a, replacement, or, in, combination, with, carbon, dioxide, to, pressurise, kegs, of, some, beers, particularly, stouts, and, british, ales, due, to, the, smaller, bubbles, it, produces, which, makes, the, dispensed, beer, smoother, and, headier, a, pressure, sensitive, nitrogen, capsule, known, commonly, as, a, widget, allows, nitrogen, charged, beers, to, be, packaged, in, cans, and, bottles, nitrogen, tanks, are, also, replacing, carbon, dioxide, as, the, main, power, source, for, paintball, guns, nitrogen, must, be, kept, at, a, higher, pressure, than, co, 2, making, n, 2, tanks, heavier, and, more, expensive, some, construction, equipment, uses, pressurized, nitrogen, gas, to, help, hydraulic, system, to, provide, extra, power, to, devices, such, as, hydraulic, hammer, nitrogen, gas, formed, from, the, decomposition, of, sodium, azide, is, used, for, the, inflation, of, airbags, as, nitrogen, is, an, asphyxiant, gas, in, itself, some, jurisdictions, have, considered, asphyxiation, by, inhalation, of, pure, nitrogen, as, a, means, of, capital, punishment, as, a, substitute, for, lethal, injection, in, january, 2024, kenneth, eugene, smith, became, the, first, person, executed, by, nitrogen, asphyxiation, liquid, nitrogen, is, a, cryogenic, liquid, which, looks, like, water, when, insulated, in, proper, containers, such, as, dewar, flasks, it, can, be, transported, and, stored, with, a, low, rate, of, evaporative, loss, like, dry, ice, the, main, use, of, liquid, nitrogen, is, for, cooling, to, low, temperatures, it, is, used, in, the, cryopreservation, of, biological, materials, such, as, blood, and, reproductive, cells, sperm, and, eggs, it, is, used, in, cryotherapy, to, remove, cysts, and, warts, on, the, skin, by, freezing, them, it, is, used, in, laboratory, cold, traps, and, in, cryopumps, to, obtain, lower, pressures, in, vacuum, pumped, systems, it, is, used, to, cool, heat, sensitive, electronics, such, as, infrared, detectors, and, x, ray, detectors, other, uses, include, freeze, grinding, and, machining, materials, that, are, soft, or, rubbery, at, room, temperature, shrink, fitting, and, assembling, engineering, components, and, more, generally, to, attain, very, low, temperatures, where, necessary, because, of, its, low, cost, liquid, nitrogen, is, often, used, for, cooling, even, when, such, low, temperatures, are, not, strictly, necessary, such, as, refrigeration, of, food, freeze, branding, livestock, freezing, pipes, to, halt, flow, when, valves, are, not, present, and, consolidating, unstable, soil, by, freezing, whenever, excavation, is, going, on, underneath, although, nitrogen, is, non, toxic, when, released, into, an, enclosed, space, it, can, displace, oxygen, and, therefore, presents, an, asphyxiation, hazard, this, may, happen, with, few, warning, symptoms, since, the, human, carotid, body, is, a, relatively, poor, and, slow, low, oxygen, hypoxia, sensing, system, an, example, occurred, shortly, before, the, launch, of, the, first, space, shuttle, mission, on, march, 19, 1981, when, two, technicians, died, from, asphyxiation, after, they, walked, into, a, space, located, in, the, space, shuttle, s, mobile, launcher, platform, that, was, pressurised, with, pure, nitrogen, as, a, precaution, against, fire, when, inhaled, at, high, partial, pressures, more, than, about, 4, bar, encountered, at, depths, below, about, 30, m, in, scuba, diving, nitrogen, is, an, anesthetic, agent, causing, nitrogen, narcosis, a, temporary, state, of, mental, impairment, similar, to, nitrous, oxide, intoxication, nitrogen, dissolves, in, the, blood, and, body, fats, rapid, decompression, as, when, divers, ascend, too, quickly, or, astronauts, decompress, too, quickly, from, cabin, pressure, to, spacesuit, pressure, can, lead, to, a, potentially, fatal, condition, called, decompression, sickness, formerly, known, as, caisson, sickness, or, the, bends, when, nitrogen, bubbles, form, in, the, bloodstream, nerves, joints, and, other, sensitive, or, vital, areas, bubbles, from, other, inert, gases, gases, other, than, carbon, dioxide, and, oxygen, cause, the, same, effects, so, replacement, of, nitrogen, in, breathing, gases, may, prevent, nitrogen, narcosis, but, does, not, prevent, decompression, sickness, as, a, cryogenic, liquid, liquid, nitrogen, can, be, dangerous, by, causing, cold, burns, on, contact, although, the, leidenfrost, effect, provides, protection, for, very, short, exposure, about, one, second, ingestion, of, liquid, nitrogen, can, cause, severe, internal, damage, for, example, in, 2012, a, young, woman, in, england, had, to, have, her, stomach, removed, after, ingesting, a, cocktail, made, with, liquid, nitrogen, because, the, liquid, to, gas, expansion, ratio, of, nitrogen, is, 1, 694, at, 20, c, a, tremendous, amount, of, force, can, be, generated, if, liquid, nitrogen, is, rapidly, vaporised, in, an, enclosed, space, in, an, incident, on, january, 12, 2006, at, texas, a, m, university, the, pressure, relief, devices, of, a, tank, of, liquid, nitrogen, were, malfunctioning, and, later, sealed, as, a, result, of, the, subsequent, pressure, buildup, the, tank, failed, catastrophically, the, force, of, the, explosion, was, sufficient, to, propel, the, tank, through, the, ceiling, immediately, above, it, shatter, a, reinforced, concrete, beam, immediately, below, it, and, blow, the, walls, of, the, laboratory, 0, 1, 0, 2, m, off, their, foundations, liquid, nitrogen, readily, evaporates, to, form, gaseous, nitrogen, and, hence, the, precautions, associated, with, gaseous, nitrogen, also, apply, to, liquid, nitrogen, for, example, oxygen, sensors, are, sometimes, used, as, a, safety, precaution, when, working, with, liquid, nitrogen, to, alert, workers, of, gas, spills, into, a, confined, space, vessels, containing, liquid, nitrogen, can, condense, oxygen, from, air, the, liquid, in, such, a, vessel, becomes, increasingly, enriched, in, oxygen, boiling, point, 183, c, higher, than, that, of, nitrogen, as, the, nitrogen, evaporates, and, can, cause, violent, oxidation, of, organic, material, oxygen, deficiency, monitors, are, used, to, measure, levels, of, oxygen, in, confined, spaces, and, any, place, where, nitrogen, gas, or, liquid, are, stored, or, used, in, the, event, of, a, nitrogen, leak, and, a, decrease, in, oxygen, to, a, pre, set, alarm, level, an, oxygen, deficiency, monitor, can, be, programmed, to, set, off, audible, and, visual, alarms, thereby, providing, notification, of, the, possible, impending, danger, most, commonly, the, oxygen, range, to, alert, personnel, is, when, oxygen, levels, get, below, 19, 5, osha, specifies, that, a, hazardous, atmosphere, may, include, one, where, the, oxygen, concentration, is, below, 19, 5, or, above, 23, 5, oxygen, deficiency, monitors, can, either, be, fixed, mounted, to, the, wall, and, hard, wired, into, the, building, s, power, supply, or, simply, plugged, into, a, power, outlet, or, a, portable, hand, held, or, wearable, monitor
