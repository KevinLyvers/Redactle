a, nuclide, or, nucleide, from, nucleus, also, known, as, nuclear, species, is, a, class, of, atoms, characterized, by, their, number, of, protons, z, their, number, of, neutrons, n, and, their, nuclear, energy, state, the, word, nuclide, was, coined, by, the, american, nuclear, physicist, truman, p, kohman, in, 1947, kohman, defined, nuclide, as, a, species, of, atom, characterized, by, the, constitution, of, its, nucleus, containing, a, certain, number, of, neutrons, and, protons, the, term, thus, originally, focused, on, the, nucleus, a, nuclide, is, a, species, of, an, atom, with, a, specific, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, nucleus, for, example, carbon, 13, with, 6, protons, and, 7, neutrons, the, nuclide, concept, referring, to, individual, nuclear, species, emphasizes, nuclear, properties, over, chemical, properties, while, the, isotope, concept, grouping, all, atoms, of, each, element, emphasizes, chemical, over, nuclear, the, neutron, number, has, large, effects, on, nuclear, properties, but, its, effect, on, chemical, reactions, is, negligible, for, most, elements, even, in, the, case, of, the, very, lightest, elements, where, the, ratio, of, neutron, number, to, atomic, number, varies, the, most, between, isotopes, it, usually, has, only, a, small, effect, but, it, matters, in, some, circumstances, for, hydrogen, the, lightest, element, the, isotope, effect, is, large, enough, to, affect, biological, systems, strongly, in, the, case, of, helium, helium, 4, obeys, bose, einstein, statistics, while, helium, 3, obeys, fermi, dirac, statistics, since, isotope, is, the, older, term, it, is, better, known, than, nuclide, and, is, still, occasionally, used, in, contexts, in, which, nuclide, might, be, more, appropriate, such, as, nuclear, technology, and, nuclear, medicine, although, the, words, nuclide, and, isotope, are, often, used, interchangeably, being, isotopes, is, actually, only, one, relation, between, nuclides, the, following, table, names, some, other, relations, a, nuclide, and, its, alpha, decay, product, are, isodiaphers, z, 1, n, 2, and, z, 2, n, 1, but, with, different, energy, states, a, set, of, nuclides, with, equal, proton, number, atomic, number, i, e, of, the, same, chemical, element, but, different, neutron, numbers, are, called, isotopes, of, the, element, particular, nuclides, are, still, often, loosely, called, isotopes, but, the, term, nuclide, is, the, correct, one, in, general, i, e, when, z, is, not, fixed, in, similar, manner, a, set, of, nuclides, with, equal, mass, number, a, but, different, atomic, number, are, called, isobars, isobar, equal, in, weight, and, isotones, are, nuclides, of, equal, neutron, number, but, different, proton, numbers, likewise, nuclides, with, the, same, neutron, excess, n, z, are, called, isodiaphers, the, name, isoto, n, e, was, derived, from, the, name, isoto, p, e, to, emphasize, that, in, the, first, group, of, nuclides, it, is, the, number, of, neutrons, n, that, is, constant, whereas, in, the, second, the, number, of, protons, p, see, isotope, notation, for, an, explanation, of, the, notation, used, for, different, nuclide, or, isotope, types, nuclear, isomers, are, members, of, a, set, of, nuclides, with, equal, proton, number, and, equal, mass, number, thus, making, them, by, definition, the, same, isotope, but, different, states, of, excitation, an, example, is, the, two, states, of, the, single, isotope, 99, 43, tc, shown, among, the, decay, schemes, each, of, these, two, states, technetium, 99m, and, technetium, 99, qualifies, as, a, different, nuclide, illustrating, one, way, that, nuclides, may, differ, from, isotopes, an, isotope, may, consist, of, several, different, nuclides, of, different, excitation, states, the, longest, lived, non, ground, state, nuclear, isomer, is, the, nuclide, tantalum, 180m, 180m, 73, ta, which, has, a, half, life, in, excess, of, 1, 000, trillion, years, this, nuclide, occurs, primordially, and, has, never, been, observed, to, decay, to, the, ground, state, in, contrast, the, ground, state, nuclide, tantalum, 180, does, not, occur, primordially, since, it, decays, with, a, half, life, of, only, 8, hours, to, 180, hf, 86, or, 180, w, 14, there, are, 251, nuclides, in, nature, that, have, never, been, observed, to, decay, they, occur, among, the, 80, different, elements, that, have, one, or, more, stable, isotopes, see, stable, nuclide, and, primordial, nuclide, unstable, nuclides, are, radioactive, and, are, called, radionuclides, their, decay, products, daughter, products, are, called, radiogenic, nuclides, natural, radionuclides, may, be, conveniently, subdivided, into, three, types, first, those, whose, half, lives, t, 1, 2, are, at, least, 2, as, long, as, the, age, of, the, earth, for, practical, purposes, these, are, difficult, to, detect, with, half, lives, less, than, 10, of, the, age, of, the, earth, 4, 6, 10, 9, years, these, are, remnants, of, nucleosynthesis, that, occurred, in, stars, before, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, for, example, the, isotope, 238, u, t, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 9, years, of, uranium, is, still, fairly, abundant, in, nature, but, the, shorter, lived, isotope, 235, u, t, 1, 2, 0, 7, 10, 9, years, is, 138, times, rarer, about, 34, of, these, nuclides, have, been, discovered, see, list, of, nuclides, and, primordial, nuclide, for, details, the, second, group, of, radionuclides, that, exist, naturally, consists, of, radiogenic, nuclides, such, as, 226, ra, t, 1, 2, 1602, years, an, isotope, of, radium, which, are, formed, by, radioactive, decay, they, occur, in, the, decay, chains, of, primordial, isotopes, of, uranium, or, thorium, some, of, these, nuclides, are, very, short, lived, such, as, isotopes, of, francium, there, exist, about, 51, of, these, daughter, nuclides, that, have, half, lives, too, short, to, be, primordial, and, which, exist, in, nature, solely, due, to, decay, from, longer, lived, radioactive, primordial, nuclides, the, third, group, consists, of, nuclides, that, are, continuously, being, made, in, another, fashion, that, is, not, simple, spontaneous, radioactive, decay, i, e, only, one, atom, involved, with, no, incoming, particle, but, instead, involves, a, natural, nuclear, reaction, these, occur, when, atoms, react, with, natural, neutrons, from, cosmic, rays, spontaneous, fission, or, other, sources, or, are, bombarded, directly, with, cosmic, rays, the, latter, if, non, primordial, are, called, cosmogenic, nuclides, other, types, of, natural, nuclear, reactions, produce, nuclides, that, are, said, to, be, nucleogenic, nuclides, an, example, of, nuclides, made, by, nuclear, reactions, are, cosmogenic, 14, c, radiocarbon, that, is, made, by, cosmic, ray, bombardment, of, other, elements, and, nucleogenic, 239, pu, which, is, still, being, created, by, neutron, bombardment, of, natural, 238, u, as, a, result, of, natural, fission, in, uranium, ores, cosmogenic, nuclides, may, be, either, stable, or, radioactive, if, they, are, stable, their, existence, must, be, deduced, against, a, background, of, stable, nuclides, since, every, known, stable, nuclide, is, present, on, earth, primordially, beyond, the, naturally, occurring, nuclides, more, than, 3000, radionuclides, of, varying, half, lives, have, been, artificially, produced, and, characterized, the, known, nuclides, are, shown, in, table, of, nuclides, a, list, of, primordial, nuclides, is, given, sorted, by, element, at, list, of, elements, by, stability, of, isotopes, list, of, nuclides, is, sorted, by, half, life, for, the, 905, nuclides, with, half, lives, longer, than, one, hour, this, is, a, summary, table, for, the, 905, nuclides, with, half, lives, longer, than, one, hour, given, in, list, of, nuclides, note, that, numbers, are, not, exact, and, may, change, slightly, in, the, future, if, some, stable, nuclides, are, observed, to, be, radioactive, with, very, long, half, lives, atomic, nuclei, other, than, hydrogen, 1, 1, h, have, protons, and, neutrons, bound, together, by, the, residual, strong, force, because, protons, are, positively, charged, they, repel, each, other, neutrons, which, are, electrically, neutral, stabilize, the, nucleus, in, two, ways, their, copresence, pushes, protons, slightly, apart, reducing, the, electrostatic, repulsion, between, the, protons, and, they, exert, the, attractive, nuclear, force, on, each, other, and, on, protons, for, this, reason, one, or, more, neutrons, are, necessary, for, two, or, more, protons, to, be, bound, into, a, nucleus, as, the, number, of, protons, increases, so, does, the, ratio, of, neutrons, to, protons, necessary, to, ensure, a, stable, nucleus, see, graph, for, example, although, the, neutron, proton, ratio, of, 3, 2, he, is, 1, 2, the, neutron, proton, ratio, of, 238, 92, u, is, greater, than, 3, 2, a, number, of, lighter, elements, have, stable, nuclides, with, the, ratio, 1, 1, z, n, the, nuclide, 40, 20, ca, calcium, 40, is, observationally, the, heaviest, stable, nuclide, with, the, same, number, of, neutrons, and, protons, all, stable, nuclides, heavier, than, calcium, 40, contain, more, neutrons, than, protons, the, proton, neutron, ratio, is, not, the, only, factor, affecting, nuclear, stability, it, depends, also, on, even, or, odd, parity, of, its, atomic, number, z, neutron, number, n, and, consequently, of, their, sum, the, mass, number, a, oddness, of, both, z, and, n, tends, to, lower, the, nuclear, binding, energy, making, odd, nuclei, generally, less, stable, this, remarkable, difference, of, nuclear, binding, energy, between, neighbouring, nuclei, especially, of, odd, a, isobars, has, important, consequences, unstable, isotopes, with, a, nonoptimal, number, of, neutrons, or, protons, decay, by, beta, decay, including, positron, decay, electron, capture, or, more, exotic, means, such, as, spontaneous, fission, and, cluster, decay, the, majority, of, stable, nuclides, are, even, proton, even, neutron, where, all, numbers, z, n, and, a, are, even, the, odd, a, stable, nuclides, are, divided, roughly, evenly, into, odd, proton, even, neutron, and, even, proton, odd, neutron, nuclides, odd, proton, odd, neutron, nuclides, and, nuclei, are, the, least, common
