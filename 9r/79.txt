the, decibel, symbol, db, is, a, relative, unit, of, measurement, equal, to, one, tenth, of, a, bel, b, it, expresses, the, ratio, of, two, values, of, a, power, or, root, power, quantity, on, a, logarithmic, scale, two, signals, whose, levels, differ, by, one, decibel, have, a, power, ratio, of, 10, 1, 10, approximately, 1, 26, or, root, power, ratio, of, 10, 1, 20, approximately, 1, 12, the, unit, expresses, a, relative, change, or, an, absolute, value, in, the, latter, case, the, numeric, value, expresses, the, ratio, of, a, value, to, a, fixed, reference, value, when, used, in, this, way, the, unit, symbol, is, often, suffixed, with, letter, codes, that, indicate, the, reference, value, for, example, for, the, reference, value, of, 1, volt, a, common, suffix, is, v, e, g, 20, dbv, two, principal, types, of, scaling, of, the, decibel, are, in, common, use, when, expressing, a, power, ratio, it, is, defined, as, ten, times, the, logarithm, with, base, 10, that, is, a, change, in, power, by, a, factor, of, 10, corresponds, to, a, 10, db, change, in, level, when, expressing, root, power, quantities, a, change, in, amplitude, by, a, factor, of, 10, corresponds, to, a, 20, db, change, in, level, the, decibel, scales, differ, by, a, factor, of, two, so, that, the, related, power, and, root, power, levels, change, by, the, same, value, in, linear, systems, where, power, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, amplitude, the, definition, of, the, decibel, originated, in, the, measurement, of, transmission, loss, and, power, in, telephony, of, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, bell, system, in, the, united, states, the, bel, was, named, in, honor, of, alexander, graham, bell, but, the, bel, is, seldom, used, instead, the, decibel, is, used, for, a, wide, variety, of, measurements, in, science, and, engineering, most, prominently, for, sound, power, in, acoustics, in, electronics, and, control, theory, in, electronics, the, gains, of, amplifiers, attenuation, of, signals, and, signal, to, noise, ratios, are, often, expressed, in, decibels, the, decibel, originates, from, methods, used, to, quantify, signal, loss, in, telegraph, and, telephone, circuits, until, the, mid, 1920s, the, unit, for, loss, was, miles, of, standard, cable, msc, 1, msc, corresponded, to, the, loss, of, power, over, one, mile, approximately, 1, 6, km, of, standard, telephone, cable, at, a, frequency, of, 5000, radians, per, second, 795, 8, hz, and, matched, closely, the, smallest, attenuation, detectable, to, a, listener, a, standard, telephone, cable, was, a, cable, having, uniformly, distributed, resistance, of, 88, ohms, per, loop, mile, and, uniformly, distributed, shunt, capacitance, of, 0, 054, microfarads, per, mile, approximately, corresponding, to, 19, gauge, wire, in, 1924, bell, telephone, laboratories, received, a, favorable, response, to, a, new, unit, definition, among, members, of, the, international, advisory, committee, on, long, distance, telephony, in, europe, and, replaced, the, msc, with, the, transmission, unit, tu, 1, tu, was, defined, such, that, the, number, of, tus, was, ten, times, the, base, 10, logarithm, of, the, ratio, of, measured, power, to, a, reference, power, the, definition, was, conveniently, chosen, such, that, 1, tu, approximated, 1, msc, specifically, 1, msc, was, 1, 056, tu, in, 1928, the, bell, system, renamed, the, tu, into, the, decibel, being, one, tenth, of, a, newly, defined, unit, for, the, base, 10, logarithm, of, the, power, ratio, it, was, named, the, bel, in, honor, of, the, telecommunications, pioneer, alexander, graham, bell, the, bel, is, seldom, used, as, the, decibel, was, the, proposed, working, unit, the, naming, and, early, definition, of, the, decibel, is, described, in, the, nbs, standard, s, yearbook, of, 1931, since, the, earliest, days, of, the, telephone, the, need, for, a, unit, in, which, to, measure, the, transmission, efficiency, of, telephone, facilities, has, been, recognized, the, introduction, of, cable, in, 1896, afforded, a, stable, basis, for, a, convenient, unit, and, the, mile, of, standard, cable, came, into, general, use, shortly, thereafter, this, unit, was, employed, up, to, 1923, when, a, new, unit, was, adopted, as, being, more, suitable, for, modern, telephone, work, the, new, transmission, unit, is, widely, used, among, the, foreign, telephone, organizations, and, recently, it, was, termed, the, decibel, at, the, suggestion, of, the, international, advisory, committee, on, long, distance, telephony, the, decibel, may, be, defined, by, the, statement, that, two, amounts, of, power, differ, by, 1, decibel, when, they, are, in, the, ratio, of, 10, 0, 1, and, any, two, amounts, of, power, differ, by, n, decibels, when, they, are, in, the, ratio, of, 10, n, 0, 1, the, number, of, transmission, units, expressing, the, ratio, of, any, two, powers, is, therefore, ten, times, the, common, logarithm, of, that, ratio, this, method, of, designating, the, gain, or, loss, of, power, in, telephone, circuits, permits, direct, addition, or, subtraction, of, the, units, expressing, the, efficiency, of, different, parts, of, the, circuit, in, 1954, j, w, horton, argued, that, the, use, of, the, decibel, as, a, unit, for, quantities, other, than, transmission, loss, led, to, confusion, and, suggested, the, name, logit, for, standard, magnitudes, which, combine, by, multiplication, to, contrast, with, the, name, unit, for, standard, magnitudes, which, combine, by, addition, in, april, 2003, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, considered, a, recommendation, for, the, inclusion, of, the, decibel, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, but, decided, against, the, proposal, however, the, decibel, is, recognized, by, other, international, bodies, such, as, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, and, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, the, iec, permits, the, use, of, the, decibel, with, root, power, quantities, as, well, as, power, and, this, recommendation, is, followed, by, many, national, standards, bodies, such, as, nist, which, justifies, the, use, of, the, decibel, for, voltage, ratios, in, spite, of, their, widespread, use, suffixes, such, as, in, dba, or, dbv, are, not, recognized, by, the, iec, or, iso, iso, 80000, 3, describes, definitions, for, quantities, and, units, of, space, and, time, the, iec, standard, 60027, 3, 2002, defines, the, following, quantities, the, decibel, db, is, one, tenth, of, a, bel, 1, db, 0, 1, b, the, bel, b, is, 1, 2, ln, 10, nepers, 1, b, 1, 2, ln, 10, np, the, neper, is, the, change, in, the, level, of, a, root, power, quantity, when, the, root, power, quantity, changes, by, a, factor, of, e, that, is, 1, np, ln, e, 1, thereby, relating, all, of, the, units, as, nondimensional, natural, log, of, root, power, quantity, ratios, 1, db, 0, 115, 13, np, 0, 115, 13, finally, the, level, of, a, quantity, is, the, logarithm, of, the, ratio, of, the, value, of, that, quantity, to, a, reference, value, of, the, same, kind, of, quantity, therefore, the, bel, represents, the, logarithm, of, a, ratio, between, two, power, quantities, of, 10, 1, or, the, logarithm, of, a, ratio, between, two, root, power, quantities, of, 10, 1, two, signals, whose, levels, differ, by, one, decibel, have, a, power, ratio, of, 10, 1, 10, which, is, approximately, 1, 258, 93, and, an, amplitude, root, power, quantity, ratio, of, 10, 1, 20, 1, 122, 02, the, bel, is, rarely, used, either, without, a, prefix, or, with, si, unit, prefixes, other, than, deci, it, is, preferred, for, example, to, use, hundredths, of, a, decibel, rather, than, millibels, thus, five, one, thousandths, of, a, bel, would, normally, be, written, 0, 05, db, and, not, 5, mb, the, method, of, expressing, a, ratio, as, a, level, in, decibels, depends, on, whether, the, measured, property, is, a, power, quantity, or, a, root, power, quantity, see, power, root, power, and, field, quantities, for, details, when, referring, to, measurements, of, power, quantities, a, ratio, can, be, expressed, as, a, level, in, decibels, by, evaluating, ten, times, the, base, 10, logarithm, of, the, ratio, of, the, measured, quantity, to, reference, value, thus, the, ratio, of, p, measured, power, to, p, 0, reference, power, is, represented, by, l, p, that, ratio, expressed, in, decibels, which, is, calculated, using, the, formula, the, base, 10, logarithm, of, the, ratio, of, the, two, power, quantities, is, the, number, of, bels, the, number, of, decibels, is, ten, times, the, number, of, bels, equivalently, a, decibel, is, one, tenth, of, a, bel, p, and, p, 0, must, measure, the, same, type, of, quantity, and, have, the, same, units, before, calculating, the, ratio, if, p, p, 0, in, the, above, equation, then, l, p, 0, if, p, is, greater, than, p, 0, then, l, p, is, positive, if, p, is, less, than, p, 0, then, l, p, is, negative, rearranging, the, above, equation, gives, the, following, formula, for, p, in, terms, of, p, 0, and, l, p, when, referring, to, measurements, of, root, power, quantities, it, is, usual, to, consider, the, ratio, of, the, squares, of, f, measured, and, f, 0, reference, this, is, because, the, definitions, were, originally, formulated, to, give, the, same, value, for, relative, ratios, for, both, power, and, root, power, quantities, thus, the, following, definition, is, used, the, formula, may, be, rearranged, to, give, similarly, in, electrical, circuits, dissipated, power, is, typically, proportional, to, the, square, of, voltage, or, current, when, the, impedance, is, constant, taking, voltage, as, an, example, this, leads, to, the, equation, for, power, gain, level, l, g, where, v, out, is, the, root, mean, square, rms, output, voltage, v, in, is, the, rms, input, voltage, a, similar, formula, holds, for, current, the, term, root, power, quantity, is, introduced, by, iso, standard, 80000, 1, 2009, as, a, substitute, of, field, quantity, the, term, field, quantity, is, deprecated, by, that, standard, and, root, power, is, used, throughout, this, article, although, power, and, root, power, quantities, are, different, quantities, their, respective, levels, are, historically, measured, in, the, same, units, typically, decibels, a, factor, of, 2, is, introduced, to, make, changes, in, the, respective, levels, match, under, restricted, conditions, such, as, when, the, medium, is, linear, and, the, same, waveform, is, under, consideration, with, changes, in, amplitude, or, the, medium, impedance, is, linear, and, independent, of, both, frequency, and, time, this, relies, on, the, relationship, holding, in, a, nonlinear, system, this, relationship, does, not, hold, by, the, definition, of, linearity, however, even, in, a, linear, system, in, which, the, power, quantity, is, the, product, of, two, linearly, related, quantities, e, g, voltage, and, current, if, the, impedance, is, frequency, or, time, dependent, this, relationship, does, not, hold, in, general, for, example, if, the, energy, spectrum, of, the, waveform, changes, for, differences, in, level, the, required, relationship, is, relaxed, from, that, above, to, one, of, proportionality, i, e, the, reference, quantities, p, 0, and, f, 0, need, not, be, related, or, equivalently, must, hold, to, allow, the, power, level, difference, to, be, equal, to, the, root, power, level, difference, from, power, p, 1, and, f, 1, to, p, 2, and, f, 2, an, example, might, be, an, amplifier, with, unity, voltage, gain, independent, of, load, and, frequency, driving, a, load, with, a, frequency, dependent, impedance, the, relative, voltage, gain, of, the, amplifier, is, always, 0, db, but, the, power, gain, depends, on, the, changing, spectral, composition, of, the, waveform, being, amplified, frequency, dependent, impedances, may, be, analyzed, by, considering, the, quantities, power, spectral, density, and, the, associated, root, power, quantities, via, the, fourier, transform, which, allows, elimination, of, the, frequency, dependence, in, the, analysis, by, analyzing, the, system, at, each, frequency, independently, since, logarithm, differences, measured, in, these, units, often, represent, power, ratios, and, root, power, ratios, values, for, both, are, shown, below, the, bel, is, traditionally, used, as, a, unit, of, logarithmic, power, ratio, while, the, neper, is, used, for, logarithmic, root, power, amplitude, ratio, the, unit, dbw, is, often, used, to, denote, a, ratio, for, which, the, reference, is, 1, w, and, similarly, dbm, for, a, 1, mw, reference, point, 31, 62, v, 1, v, 2, 1, kw, 1, w, illustrating, the, consequence, from, the, definitions, above, that, l, g, has, the, same, value, 30, db, regardless, of, whether, it, is, obtained, from, powers, or, from, amplitudes, provided, that, in, the, specific, system, being, considered, power, ratios, are, equal, to, amplitude, ratios, squared, a, change, in, power, ratio, by, a, factor, of, 10, corresponds, to, a, change, in, level, of, 10, db, a, change, in, power, ratio, by, a, factor, of, 2, or, 1, 2, is, approximately, a, change, of, 3, db, more, precisely, the, change, is, 3, 0103, db, but, this, is, almost, universally, rounded, to, 3, db, in, technical, writing, this, implies, an, increase, in, voltage, by, a, factor, of, 2, 1, 4142, likewise, a, doubling, or, halving, of, the, voltage, corresponding, to, a, quadrupling, or, quartering, of, the, power, is, commonly, described, as, 6, db, rather, than, 6, 0206, db, should, it, be, necessary, to, make, the, distinction, the, number, of, decibels, is, written, with, additional, significant, figures, 3, 000, db, corresponds, to, a, power, ratio, of, 10, 3, 10, or, 1, 9953, about, 0, 24, different, from, exactly, 2, and, a, voltage, ratio, of, 1, 4125, 0, 12, different, from, exactly, 2, similarly, an, increase, of, 6, 000, db, corresponds, to, the, power, ratio, is, 10, 6, 10, 3, 9811, about, 0, 5, different, from, 4, the, decibel, is, useful, for, representing, large, ratios, and, for, simplifying, representation, of, multiplicative, effects, such, as, attenuation, from, multiple, sources, along, a, signal, chain, its, application, in, systems, with, additive, effects, is, less, intuitive, such, as, in, the, combined, sound, pressure, level, of, two, machines, operating, together, care, is, also, necessary, with, decibels, directly, in, fractions, and, with, the, units, of, multiplicative, operations, the, logarithmic, scale, nature, of, the, decibel, means, that, a, very, large, range, of, ratios, can, be, represented, by, a, convenient, number, in, a, manner, similar, to, scientific, notation, this, allows, one, to, clearly, visualize, huge, changes, of, some, quantity, see, bode, plot, and, semi, log, plot, for, example, 120, db, spl, may, be, clearer, than, a, trillion, times, more, intense, than, the, threshold, of, hearing, level, values, in, decibels, can, be, added, instead, of, multiplying, the, underlying, power, values, which, means, that, the, overall, gain, of, a, multi, component, system, such, as, a, series, of, amplifier, stages, can, be, calculated, by, summing, the, gains, in, decibels, of, the, individual, components, rather, than, multiply, the, amplification, factors, that, is, log, a, b, c, log, a, log, b, log, c, practically, this, means, that, armed, only, with, the, knowledge, that, 1, db, is, a, power, gain, of, approximately, 26, 3, db, is, approximately, 2, power, gain, and, 10, db, is, 10, power, gain, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, power, ratio, of, a, system, from, the, gain, in, db, with, only, simple, addition, and, multiplication, for, example, however, according, to, its, critics, the, decibel, creates, confusion, obscures, reasoning, is, more, related, to, the, era, of, slide, rules, than, to, modern, digital, processing, and, is, cumbersome, and, difficult, to, interpret, quantities, in, decibels, are, not, necessarily, additive, thus, being, of, unacceptable, form, for, use, in, dimensional, analysis, thus, units, require, special, care, in, decibel, operations, take, for, example, carrier, to, noise, density, ratio, c, n, 0, in, hertz, involving, carrier, power, c, in, watts, and, noise, power, spectral, density, n, 0, in, w, hz, expressed, in, decibels, this, ratio, would, be, a, subtraction, c, n, 0, db, c, db, n, 0db, however, the, linear, scale, units, still, simplify, in, the, implied, fraction, so, that, the, results, would, be, expressed, in, db, hz, according, to, mitschke, the, advantage, of, using, a, logarithmic, measure, is, that, in, a, transmission, chain, there, are, many, elements, concatenated, and, each, has, its, own, gain, or, attenuation, to, obtain, the, total, addition, of, decibel, values, is, much, more, convenient, than, multiplication, of, the, individual, factors, however, for, the, same, reason, that, humans, excel, at, additive, operation, over, multiplication, decibels, are, awkward, in, inherently, additive, operations, if, two, machines, each, individually, produce, a, sound, pressure, level, of, say, 90, db, at, a, certain, point, then, when, both, are, operating, together, we, should, expect, the, combined, sound, pressure, level, to, increase, to, 93, db, but, certainly, not, to, 180, db, suppose, that, the, noise, from, a, machine, is, measured, including, the, contribution, of, background, noise, and, found, to, be, 87, dba, but, when, the, machine, is, switched, off, the, background, noise, alone, is, measured, as, 83, dba, the, machine, noise, may, be, obtained, by, subtracting, the, 83, dba, background, noise, from, the, combined, level, of, 87, dba, i, e, 84, 8, dba, in, order, to, find, a, representative, value, of, the, sound, level, in, a, room, a, number, of, measurements, are, taken, at, different, positions, within, the, room, and, an, average, value, is, calculated, compare, the, logarithmic, and, arithmetic, averages, of, 70, db, and, 90, db, logarithmic, average, 87, db, arithmetic, average, 80, db, addition, on, a, logarithmic, scale, is, called, logarithmic, addition, and, can, be, defined, by, taking, exponentials, to, convert, to, a, linear, scale, adding, there, and, then, taking, logarithms, to, return, for, example, where, operations, on, decibels, are, logarithmic, addition, subtraction, and, logarithmic, multiplication, division, while, operations, on, the, linear, scale, are, the, usual, operations, the, logarithmic, mean, is, obtained, from, the, logarithmic, sum, by, subtracting, 10, log, 10, 2, displaystyle, 10, log, 10, 2, since, logarithmic, division, is, linear, subtraction, attenuation, constants, in, topics, such, as, optical, fiber, communication, and, radio, propagation, path, loss, are, often, expressed, as, a, fraction, or, ratio, to, distance, of, transmission, in, this, case, db, m, represents, decibel, per, meter, db, mi, represents, decibel, per, mile, for, example, these, quantities, are, to, be, manipulated, obeying, the, rules, of, dimensional, analysis, e, g, a, 100, meter, run, with, a, 3, 5, db, km, fiber, yields, a, loss, of, 0, 35, db, 3, 5, db, km, 0, 1, km, the, human, perception, of, the, intensity, of, sound, and, light, more, nearly, approximates, the, logarithm, of, intensity, rather, than, a, linear, relationship, see, weber, fechner, law, making, the, db, scale, a, useful, measure, the, decibel, is, commonly, used, in, acoustics, as, a, unit, of, sound, power, level, or, sound, pressure, level, the, reference, pressure, for, sound, in, air, is, set, at, the, typical, threshold, of, perception, of, an, average, human, and, there, are, common, comparisons, used, to, illustrate, different, levels, of, sound, pressure, as, sound, pressure, is, a, root, power, quantity, the, appropriate, version, of, the, unit, definition, is, used, where, p, rms, is, the, root, mean, square, of, the, measured, sound, pressure, and, p, ref, is, the, standard, reference, sound, pressure, of, 20, micropascals, in, air, or, 1, micropascal, in, water, use, of, the, decibel, in, underwater, acoustics, leads, to, confusion, in, part, because, of, this, difference, in, reference, value, sound, intensity, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, sound, pressure, therefore, the, sound, intensity, level, can, also, be, defined, as, the, human, ear, has, a, large, dynamic, range, in, sound, reception, the, ratio, of, the, sound, intensity, that, causes, permanent, damage, during, short, exposure, to, that, of, the, quietest, sound, that, the, ear, can, hear, is, equal, to, or, greater, than, 1, trillion, 10, 12, such, large, measurement, ranges, are, conveniently, expressed, in, logarithmic, scale, the, base, 10, logarithm, of, 10, 12, is, 12, which, is, expressed, as, a, sound, intensity, level, of, 120, db, re, 1, pw, m, 2, the, reference, values, of, i, and, p, in, air, have, been, chosen, such, that, this, corresponds, approximately, to, a, sound, pressure, level, of, 120, db, re, 20, pa, since, the, human, ear, is, not, equally, sensitive, to, all, sound, frequencies, the, acoustic, power, spectrum, is, modified, by, frequency, weighting, a, weighting, being, the, most, common, standard, to, get, the, weighted, acoustic, power, before, converting, to, a, sound, level, or, noise, level, in, decibels, the, decibel, is, used, in, telephony, and, audio, similarly, to, the, use, in, acoustics, a, frequency, weighted, power, is, often, used, for, audio, noise, measurements, in, electrical, circuits, the, weightings, are, called, psophometric, weightings, in, electronics, the, decibel, is, often, used, to, express, power, or, amplitude, ratios, as, for, gains, in, preference, to, arithmetic, ratios, or, percentages, one, advantage, is, that, the, total, decibel, gain, of, a, series, of, components, such, as, amplifiers, and, attenuators, can, be, calculated, simply, by, summing, the, decibel, gains, of, the, individual, components, similarly, in, telecommunications, decibels, denote, signal, gain, or, loss, from, a, transmitter, to, a, receiver, through, some, medium, free, space, waveguide, coaxial, cable, fiber, optics, etc, using, a, link, budget, the, decibel, unit, can, also, be, combined, with, a, reference, level, often, indicated, via, a, suffix, to, create, an, absolute, unit, of, electric, power, for, example, it, can, be, combined, with, m, for, milliwatt, to, produce, the, dbm, a, power, level, of, 0, dbm, corresponds, to, one, milliwatt, and, 1, dbm, is, one, decibel, greater, about, 1, 259, mw, in, professional, audio, specifications, a, popular, unit, is, the, dbu, this, is, relative, to, the, root, mean, square, voltage, which, delivers, 1, mw, 0, dbm, into, a, 600, ohm, resistor, or, 1, mw, 600, 0, 775, v, rms, when, used, in, a, 600, ohm, circuit, historically, the, standard, reference, impedance, in, telephone, circuits, dbu, and, dbm, are, identical, in, an, optical, link, if, a, known, amount, of, optical, power, in, dbm, referenced, to, 1, mw, is, launched, into, a, fiber, and, the, losses, in, db, decibels, of, each, component, e, g, connectors, splices, and, lengths, of, fiber, are, known, the, overall, link, loss, may, be, quickly, calculated, by, addition, and, subtraction, of, decibel, quantities, in, spectrometry, and, optics, the, blocking, unit, used, to, measure, optical, density, is, equivalent, to, 1, b, in, connection, with, video, and, digital, image, sensors, decibels, generally, represent, ratios, of, video, voltages, or, digitized, light, intensities, using, 20, log, of, the, ratio, even, when, the, represented, intensity, optical, power, is, directly, proportional, to, the, voltage, generated, by, the, sensor, not, to, its, square, as, in, a, ccd, imager, where, response, voltage, is, linear, in, intensity, thus, a, camera, signal, to, noise, ratio, or, dynamic, range, quoted, as, 40, db, represents, a, ratio, of, 100, 1, between, optical, signal, intensity, and, optical, equivalent, dark, noise, intensity, not, a, 10, 000, 1, intensity, power, ratio, as, 40, db, might, suggest, sometimes, the, 20, log, ratio, definition, is, applied, to, electron, counts, or, photon, counts, directly, which, are, proportional, to, sensor, signal, amplitude, without, the, need, to, consider, whether, the, voltage, response, to, intensity, is, linear, however, as, mentioned, above, the, 10, log, intensity, convention, prevails, more, generally, in, physical, optics, including, fiber, optics, so, the, terminology, can, become, murky, between, the, conventions, of, digital, photographic, technology, and, physics, most, commonly, quantities, called, dynamic, range, or, signal, to, noise, of, the, camera, would, be, specified, in, 20, log, db, but, in, related, contexts, e, g, attenuation, gain, intensifier, snr, or, rejection, ratio, the, term, should, be, interpreted, cautiously, as, confusion, of, the, two, units, can, result, in, very, large, misunderstandings, of, the, value, photographers, typically, use, an, alternative, base, 2, log, unit, the, stop, to, describe, light, intensity, ratios, or, dynamic, range, suffixes, are, commonly, attached, to, the, basic, db, unit, in, order, to, indicate, the, reference, value, by, which, the, ratio, is, calculated, for, example, dbm, indicates, power, measurement, relative, to, 1, milliwatt, in, cases, where, the, unit, value, of, the, reference, is, stated, the, decibel, value, is, known, as, absolute, if, the, unit, value, of, the, reference, is, not, explicitly, stated, as, in, the, db, gain, of, an, amplifier, then, the, decibel, value, is, considered, relative, this, form, of, attaching, suffixes, to, db, is, widespread, in, practice, albeit, being, against, the, rules, promulgated, by, standards, bodies, iso, and, iec, given, the, unacceptability, of, attaching, information, to, units, and, the, unacceptability, of, mixing, information, with, units, the, iec, 60027, 3, standard, recommends, the, following, format, l, x, re, x, ref, or, as, l, x, x, ref, where, x, is, the, quantity, symbol, and, x, ref, is, the, value, of, the, reference, quantity, e, g, l, e, re, 1, v, m, 20, db, or, l, e, 1, v, m, 20, db, for, the, electric, field, strength, e, relative, to, 1, v, m, reference, value, if, the, measurement, result, 20, db, is, presented, separately, it, can, be, specified, using, the, information, in, parentheses, which, is, then, part, of, the, surrounding, text, and, not, a, part, of, the, unit, 20, db, re, 1, v, m, or, 20, db, 1, v, m, outside, of, documents, adhering, to, si, units, the, practice, is, very, common, as, illustrated, by, the, following, examples, there, is, no, general, rule, with, various, discipline, specific, practices, sometimes, the, suffix, is, a, unit, symbol, w, k, m, sometimes, it, is, a, transliteration, of, a, unit, symbol, uv, instead, of, v, for, microvolt, sometimes, it, is, an, acronym, for, the, unit, s, name, sm, for, square, meter, m, for, milliwatt, other, times, it, is, a, mnemonic, for, the, type, of, quantity, being, calculated, i, for, antenna, gain, with, respect, to, an, isotropic, antenna, for, anything, normalized, by, the, em, wavelength, or, otherwise, a, general, attribute, or, identifier, about, the, nature, of, the, quantity, a, for, a, weighted, sound, pressure, level, the, suffix, is, often, connected, with, a, hyphen, as, in, db, hz, or, with, a, space, as, in, db, hl, or, enclosed, in, parentheses, as, in, db, sm, or, with, no, intervening, character, as, in, dbm, which, is, non, compliant, with, international, standards, since, the, decibel, is, defined, with, respect, to, power, not, amplitude, conversions, of, voltage, ratios, to, decibels, must, square, the, amplitude, or, use, the, factor, of, 20, instead, of, 10, as, discussed, above, probably, the, most, common, usage, of, decibels, in, reference, to, sound, level, is, db, spl, sound, pressure, level, referenced, to, the, nominal, threshold, of, human, hearing, the, measures, of, pressure, a, root, power, quantity, use, the, factor, of, 20, and, the, measures, of, power, e, g, db, sil, and, db, swl, use, the, factor, of, 10, see, also, dbv, and, dbu, above
