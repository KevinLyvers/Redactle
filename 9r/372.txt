cobalt, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, co, and, atomic, number, 27, as, with, nickel, cobalt, is, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, only, in, a, chemically, combined, form, save, for, small, deposits, found, in, alloys, of, natural, meteoric, iron, the, free, element, produced, by, reductive, smelting, is, a, hard, lustrous, somewhat, brittle, gray, metal, cobalt, based, blue, pigments, cobalt, blue, have, been, used, since, antiquity, for, jewelry, and, paints, and, to, impart, a, distinctive, blue, tint, to, glass, the, color, was, long, thought, to, be, due, to, the, metal, bismuth, miners, had, long, used, the, name, kobold, ore, german, for, goblin, ore, for, some, of, the, blue, pigment, producing, minerals, they, were, so, named, because, they, were, poor, in, known, metals, and, gave, off, poisonous, arsenic, containing, fumes, when, smelted, in, 1735, such, ores, were, found, to, be, reducible, to, a, new, metal, the, first, discovered, since, ancient, times, which, was, ultimately, named, for, the, kobold, today, some, cobalt, is, produced, specifically, from, one, of, a, number, of, metallic, lustered, ores, such, as, cobaltite, coass, the, element, is, more, usually, produced, as, a, by, product, of, copper, and, nickel, mining, the, copperbelt, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, drc, and, zambia, yields, most, of, the, global, cobalt, production, world, production, in, 2016, was, 116, 000, tonnes, 114, 000, long, tons, 128, 000, short, tons, according, to, natural, resources, canada, and, the, drc, alone, accounted, for, more, than, 50, cobalt, is, primarily, used, in, lithium, ion, batteries, and, in, the, manufacture, of, magnetic, wear, resistant, and, high, strength, alloys, the, compounds, cobalt, silicate, and, cobalt, ii, aluminate, coal, 2, o, 4, cobalt, blue, give, a, distinctive, deep, blue, color, to, glass, ceramics, inks, paints, and, varnishes, cobalt, occurs, naturally, as, only, one, stable, isotope, cobalt, 59, cobalt, 60, is, a, commercially, important, radioisotope, used, as, a, radioactive, tracer, and, for, the, production, of, high, energy, gamma, rays, cobalt, is, also, used, in, the, petroleum, industry, as, a, catalyst, when, refining, crude, oil, this, is, to, purge, it, of, sulfur, which, is, very, polluting, when, burned, and, causes, acid, rain, cobalt, is, the, active, center, of, a, group, of, coenzymes, called, cobalamins, vitamin, b, 12, the, best, known, example, of, the, type, is, an, essential, vitamin, for, all, animals, cobalt, in, inorganic, form, is, also, a, micronutrient, for, bacteria, algae, and, fungi, the, name, cobalt, derives, from, a, type, of, ore, considered, a, nuisance, by, 16th, century, german, silver, miners, which, in, turn, may, have, been, named, from, a, spirit, or, goblin, held, superstitiously, responsible, for, it, this, spirit, is, considered, equitable, to, the, kobold, a, household, spirit, by, some, or, categorized, as, a, gnome, mine, spirit, by, others, cobalt, is, a, ferromagnetic, metal, with, a, specific, gravity, of, 8, 9, the, curie, temperature, is, 1, 115, c, 2, 039, f, and, the, magnetic, moment, is, 1, 6, 1, 7, bohr, magnetons, per, atom, cobalt, has, a, relative, permeability, two, thirds, that, of, iron, metallic, cobalt, occurs, as, two, crystallographic, structures, hcp, and, fcc, the, ideal, transition, temperature, between, the, hcp, and, fcc, structures, is, 450, c, 842, f, but, in, practice, the, energy, difference, between, them, is, so, small, that, random, intergrowth, of, the, two, is, common, cobalt, is, a, weakly, reducing, metal, that, is, protected, from, oxidation, by, a, passivating, oxide, film, it, is, attacked, by, halogens, and, sulfur, heating, in, oxygen, produces, co, 3, o, 4, which, loses, oxygen, at, 900, c, 1, 650, f, to, give, the, monoxide, coo, the, metal, reacts, with, fluorine, f, 2, at, 520, k, to, give, cof, 3, with, chlorine, cl, 2, bromine, br, 2, and, iodine, i, 2, producing, equivalent, binary, halides, it, does, not, react, with, hydrogen, gas, h, 2, or, nitrogen, gas, n, 2, even, when, heated, but, it, does, react, with, boron, carbon, phosphorus, arsenic, and, sulfur, at, ordinary, temperatures, it, reacts, slowly, with, mineral, acids, and, very, slowly, with, moist, but, not, dry, air, common, oxidation, states, of, cobalt, include, 2, and, 3, although, compounds, with, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 3, to, 5, are, also, known, a, common, oxidation, state, for, simple, compounds, is, 2, cobalt, ii, these, salts, form,

decay, products, are, element, 28, nickel, isotopes, many, different, stories, about, the, origin, of, the, word, cobalt, have, been, proposed, in, one, version, the, element, cobalt, was, named, after, kobelt, the, name, which, 16th, century, german, silver, miners, had, given, to, a, nuisance, type, of, ore, which, occurred, that, was, corrosive, and, issued, poisonous, gas, although, such, ores, had, been, used, for, blue, pigmentation, since, antiquity, the, germans, at, that, time, did, not, have, the, technology, to, smelt, the, ore, into, metal, cf, history, below, the, authority, on, such, kobelt, ore, latinized, as, cobaltum, or, cadmia, at, the, time, was, georgius, agricola, he, was, also, the, oft, quoted, authority, on, the, mine, spirits, called, kobel, latinized, as, cobalus, or, pl, cobali, in, a, separate, work, agricola, did, not, make, an, connection, between, the, similarly, named, ore, and, spirit, however, a, causal, connection, ore, blamed, on, kobel, was, made, by, a, contemporary, and, a, word, origin, connection, word, formed, from, cobalus, made, by, a, late, 18th, century, writer, later, grimms, dictionary, 1868, noted, the, kobalt, kobelt, ore, was, blamed, on, the, mountain, spirit, bergm, nnchen, which, was, also, held, responsible, for, stealing, the, silver, and, putting, out, an, ore, that, caused, poor, mining, atmosphere, wetter, and, other, health, hazards, grimms, dictionary, entries, equated, the, word, kobel, with, kobold, and, listed, it, as, a, mere, variant, diminutive, but, the, latter, is, defined, in, it, as, a, household, spirit, whereas, some, of, the, more, recent, commentators, prefer, to, characterize, the, ore, s, namesake, kobelt, rect, kobel, as, a, gnome, the, early, 20th, century, oxford, english, dictionary, 1st, edition, 1908, had, upheld, grimm, s, etymology, but, by, around, the, same, time, in, germany, the, alternate, etymology, not, endorsed, by, grimm, kob, kof, house, chamber, walt, power, ruler, was, being, proposed, as, more, convincing, somewhat, later, paul, kretschmer, 1928, explained, that, while, this, house, ruler, etymology, was, the, proper, one, that, backed, the, original, meaning, of, kobold, as, household, spirit, a, corruption, later, occurred, introducing, the, idea, of, mine, demon, to, it, the, present, edition, of, the, etymologisches, w, rterbuch, 25th, ed, 2012, under, kobold, lists, the, latter, not, grimm, s, etymology, but, still, persists, under, its, entry, for, kobalt, that, while, the, cobalt, ore, may, have, got, its, name, from, a, type, of, mine, spirit, demon, daemon, metallicus, while, stating, that, this, is, apparently, the, kobold, joseph, william, mellor, 1935, also, stated, that, cobalt, may, derive, from, kobalos, though, other, theories, had, been, suggested, several, alternative, etymologies, that, have, been, suggested, which, may, not, involve, a, spirit, kobel, or, kobold, at, all, karl, m, ller, fraureuth, conjectured, that, kobelt, derived, from, k, bel, a, bucket, used, in, mining, frequently, mentioned, by, agricola, namely, the, kobel, k, bel, latinized, as, modulus, another, theory, given, by, the, etymologisches, w, rterbuch, derives, the, term, from, k, bathium, or, rather, cobathia, arsenic, sulfide, which, occurs, as, noxious, fumes, an, etymology, from, slavonic, kowalti, was, suggested, by, emanuel, merck, 1902, w, w, skeat, and, j, berendes, construed, as, parasite, i, e, as, an, ore, parasitic, to, nickel, but, this, explanation, is, faulted, for, its, anachronism, since, nickel, was, not, discovered, until, 1751, cobalt, compounds, have, been, used, for, centuries, to, impart, a, rich, blue, color, to, glass, glazes, and, ceramics, cobalt, has, been, detected, in, egyptian, sculpture, persian, jewelry, from, the, third, millennium, bc, in, the, ruins, of, pompeii, destroyed, in, 79, ad, and, in, china, dating, from, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, and, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, ad, cobalt, has, been, used, to, color, glass, since, the, bronze, age, the, excavation, of, the, uluburun, shipwreck, yielded, an, ingot, of, blue, glass, cast, during, the, 14th, century, bc, blue, glass, from, egypt, was, either, colored, with, copper, iron, or, cobalt, the, oldest, cobalt, colored, glass, is, from, the, eighteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, 1550, 1292, bc, the, source, for, the, cobalt, the, egyptians, used, is, not, known, the, word, cobalt, is, derived, from, the, 16th, century, german, kobelt, a, type, of, ore, as, aforementioned, the, first, attempts, to, smelt, those, ores, for, copper, or, silver, failed, yielding, simply, powder, cobalt, ii, oxide, instead, because, the, primary, ores, of, cobalt, always, contain, arsenic, smelting, the, ore, oxidized, the, arsenic, into, the, highly, toxic, and, volatile, arsenic, oxide, adding, to, the, notoriety, of, the, ore, paracelsus, georgius, agricola, and, basil, valentine, all, referred, to, such, silicates, as, cobalt, swedish, chemist, georg, brandt, 1694, 1768, is, credited, with, discovering, cobalt, c, 1735, showing, it, to, be, a, previously, unknown, element, distinct, from, bismuth, and, other, traditional, metals, brandt, called, it, a, new, semi, metal, he, showed, that, compounds, of, cobalt, metal, were, the, source, of, the, blue, color, in, glass, which, previously, had, been, attributed, to, the, bismuth, found, with, cobalt, cobalt, became, the, first, metal, to, be, discovered, since, the, pre, historical, period, all, previously, known, metals, iron, copper, silver, gold, zinc, mercury, tin, lead, and, bismuth, had, no, recorded, discoverers, during, the, 19th, century, a, significant, part, of, the, world, s, production, of, cobalt, blue, a, pigment, made, with, cobalt, compounds, and, alumina, and, smalt, cobalt, glass, powdered, for, use, for, pigment, purposes, in, ceramics, and, painting, was, carried, out, at, the, norwegian, blaafarvev, rket, the, first, mines, for, the, production, of, smalt, in, the, 16th, century, were, located, in, norway, sweden, saxony, and, hungary, with, the, discovery, of, cobalt, ore, in, new, caledonia, in, 1864, the, mining, of, cobalt, in, europe, declined, with, the, discovery, of, ore, deposits, in, ontario, canada, in, 1904, and, the, discovery, of, even, larger, deposits, in, the, katanga, province, in, the, congo, in, 1914, mining, operations, shifted, again, when, the, shaba, conflict, started, in, 1978, the, copper, mines, of, katanga, province, nearly, stopped, production, the, impact, on, the, world, cobalt, economy, from, this, conflict, was, smaller, than, expected, cobalt, is, a, rare, metal, the, pigment, is, highly, toxic, and, the, industry, had, already, established, effective, ways, for, recycling, cobalt, materials, in, some, cases, industry, was, able, to, change, to, cobalt, free, alternatives, in, 1938, john, livingood, and, glenn, t, seaborg, discovered, the, radioisotope, cobalt, 60, this, isotope, was, famously, used, at, columbia, university, in, the, 1950s, to, establish, parity, violation, in, radioactive, beta, decay, after, world, war, ii, the, us, wanted, to, guarantee, the, supply, of, cobalt, ore, for, military, uses, as, the, germans, had, been, doing, and, prospected, for, cobalt, within, the, us, high, purity, cobalt, was, highly, sought, after, for, its, use, in, jet, engines, and, gas, turbines, an, adequate, supply, of, the, ore, was, found, in, idaho, near, blackbird, canyon, calera, mining, company, started, production, at, the, site, cobalt, demand, has, further, accelerated, in, the, 21st, century, as, an, essential, constituent, of, materials, used, in, rechargeable, batteries, superalloys, and, catalysts, it, has, been, argued, that, cobalt, will, be, one, of, the, main, objects, of, geopolitical, competition, in, a, world, running, on, renewable, energy, and, dependent, on, batteries, but, this, perspective, has, also, been, criticised, for, underestimating, the, power, of, economic, incentives, for, expanded, production, the, stable, form, of, cobalt, is, produced, in, supernovae, through, the, r, process, it, comprises, 0, 0029, of, the, earth, s, crust, except, as, recently, delivered, in, meteoric, iron, free, cobalt, the, native, metal, is, not, found, on, earth, s, surface, because, of, its, tendency, to, react, with, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, small, amounts, of, cobalt, compounds, are, found, in, most, rocks, soils, plants, and, animals, in, the, ocean, cobalt, typically, reacts, with, chlorine, in, nature, cobalt, is, frequently, associated, with, nickel, both, are, characteristic, components, of, meteoric, iron, though, cobalt, is, much, less, abundant, in, iron, meteorites, than, nickel, as, with, nickel, cobalt, in, meteoric, iron, alloys, may, have, been, well, enough, protected, from, oxygen, and, moisture, to, remain, as, the, free, but, alloyed, metal, cobalt, in, compound, form, occurs, in, copper, and, nickel, minerals, it, is, the, major, metallic, component, that, combines, with, sulfur, and, arsenic, in, the, sulfidic, cobaltite, coass, safflorite, coas, 2, glaucodot, co, fe, ass, and, skutterudite, coas, 3, minerals, the, mineral, cattierite, is, similar, to, pyrite, and, occurs, together, with, vaesite, in, the, copper, deposits, of, katanga, province, when, it, reaches, the, atmosphere, weathering, occurs, the, sulfide, minerals, oxidize, and, form, pink, erythrite, cobalt, glance, co, 3, aso, 4, 2, 8h, 2, o, and, spherocobaltite, coco, 3, cobalt, is, also, a, constituent, of, tobacco, smoke, the, tobacco, plant, readily, absorbs, and, accumulates, heavy, metals, like, cobalt, from, the, surrounding, soil, in, its, leaves, these, are, subsequently, inhaled, during, tobacco, smoking, the, main, ores, of, cobalt, are, cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot, and, skutterudite, see, above, but, most, cobalt, is, obtained, by, reducing, the, cobalt, by, products, of, nickel, and, copper, mining, and, smelting, since, cobalt, is, generally, produced, as, a, by, product, the, supply, of, cobalt, depends, to, a, great, extent, on, the, economic, feasibility, of, copper, and, nickel, mining, in, a, given, market, demand, for, cobalt, was, projected, to, grow, 6, in, 2017, primary, cobalt, deposits, are, rare, such, as, those, occurring, in, hydrothermal, deposits, associated, with, ultramafic, rocks, typified, by, the, bou, azzer, district, of, morocco, at, such, locations, cobalt, ores, are, mined, exclusively, albeit, at, a, lower, concentration, and, thus, require, more, downstream, processing, for, cobalt, extraction, several, methods, exist, to, separate, cobalt, from, copper, and, nickel, depending, on, the, concentration, of, cobalt, and, the, exact, composition, of, the, used, ore, one, method, is, froth, flotation, in, which, surfactants, bind, to, ore, components, leading, to, an, enrichment, of, cobalt, ores, subsequent, roasting, converts, the, ores, to, cobalt, sulfate, and, the, copper, and, the, iron, are, oxidized, to, the, oxide, leaching, with, water, extracts, the, sulfate, together, with, the, arsenates, the, residues, are, further, leached, with, sulfuric, acid, yielding, a, solution, of, copper, sulfate, cobalt, can, also, be, leached, from, the, slag, of, copper, smelting, the, products, of, the, above, mentioned, processes, are, transformed, into, the, cobalt, oxide, co, 3, o, 4, this, oxide, is, reduced, to, metal, by, the, aluminothermic, reaction, or, reduction, with, carbon, in, a, blast, furnace, the, united, states, geological, survey, estimates, world, reserves, of, cobalt, at, 7, 100, 000, metric, tons, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, drc, currently, produces, 63, of, the, world, s, cobalt, this, market, share, may, reach, 73, by, 2025, if, planned, expansions, by, mining, producers, like, glencore, plc, take, place, as, expected, bloomberg, new, energy, finance, has, estimated, that, by, 2030, global, demand, for, cobalt, could, be, 47, times, more, than, it, was, in, 2017, changes, that, congo, made, to, mining, laws, in, 2002, attracted, new, investments, in, congolese, copper, and, cobalt, projects, glencore, s, mutanda, mine, shipped, 24, 500, tons, of, cobalt, in, 2016, 40, of, congo, drc, s, output, and, nearly, a, quarter, of, global, production, after, oversupply, glencore, closed, mutanda, for, two, years, in, late, 2019, glencore, s, katanga, mining, project, is, resuming, as, well, and, should, produce, 300, 000, tons, of, copper, and, 20, 000, tons, of, cobalt, by, 2019, according, to, glencore, in, 2005, the, top, producer, of, cobalt, was, the, copper, deposits, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, s, katanga, province, formerly, shaba, province, the, area, had, almost, 40, of, global, reserves, reported, the, british, geological, survey, in, 2009, artisanal, mining,
