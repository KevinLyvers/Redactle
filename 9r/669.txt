geochronology, is, the, science, of, determining, the, age, of, rocks, fossils, and, sediments, using, signatures, inherent, in, the, rocks, themselves, absolute, geochronology, can, be, accomplished, through, radioactive, isotopes, whereas, relative, geochronology, is, provided, by, tools, such, as, paleomagnetism, and, stable, isotope, ratios, by, combining, multiple, geochronological, and, biostratigraphic, indicators, the, precision, of, the, recovered, age, can, be, improved, geochronology, is, different, in, application, from, biostratigraphy, which, is, the, science, of, assigning, sedimentary, rocks, to, a, known, geological, period, via, describing, cataloging, and, comparing, fossil, floral, and, faunal, assemblages, biostratigraphy, does, not, directly, provide, an, absolute, age, determination, of, a, rock, but, merely, places, it, within, an, interval, of, time, at, which, that, fossil, assemblage, is, known, to, have, coexisted, both, disciplines, work, together, hand, in, hand, however, to, the, point, where, they, share, the, same, system, of, naming, strata, rock, layers, and, the, time, spans, utilized, to, classify, sublayers, within, a, stratum, the, science, of, geochronology, is, the, prime, tool, used, in, the, discipline, of, chronostratigraphy, which, attempts, to, derive, absolute, age, dates, for, all, fossil, assemblages, and, determine, the, geologic, history, of, the, earth, and, extraterrestrial, bodies, by, measuring, the, amount, of, radioactive, decay, of, a, radioactive, isotope, with, a, known, half, life, geologists, can, establish, the, absolute, age, of, the, parent, material, a, number, of, radioactive, isotopes, are, used, for, this, purpose, and, depending, on, the, rate, of, decay, are, used, for, dating, different, geological, periods, more, slowly, decaying, isotopes, are, useful, for, longer, periods, of, time, but, less, accurate, in, absolute, years, with, the, exception, of, the, radiocarbon, method, most, of, these, techniques, are, actually, based, on, measuring, an, increase, in, the, abundance, of, a, radiogenic, isotope, which, is, the, decay, product, of, the, radioactive, parent, isotope, two, or, more, radiometric, methods, can, be, used, in, concert, to, achieve, more, robust, results, most, radiometric, methods, are, suitable, for, geological, time, only, but, some, such, as, the, radiocarbon, method, and, the, 40, ar, 39, ar, dating, method, can, be, extended, into, the, time, of, early, human, life, and, into, recorded, history, some, of, the, commonly, used, techniques, are, a, series, of, related, techniques, for, determining, the, age, at, which, a, geomorphic, surface, was, created, exposure, dating, or, at, which, formerly, surficial, materials, were, buried, burial, dating, exposure, dating, uses, the, concentration, of, exotic, nuclides, e, g, 10, be, 26, al, 36, cl, produced, by, cosmic, rays, interacting, with, earth, materials, as, a, proxy, for, the, age, at, which, a, surface, such, as, an, alluvial, fan, was, created, burial, dating, uses, the, differential, radioactive, decay, of, 2, cosmogenic, elements, as, a, proxy, for, the, age, at, which, a, sediment, was, screened, by, burial, from, further, cosmic, rays, exposure, luminescence, dating, techniques, observe, light, emitted, from, materials, such, as, quartz, diamond, feldspar, and, calcite, many, types, of, luminescence, techniques, are, utilized, in, geology, including, optically, stimulated, luminescence, osl, cathodoluminescence, cl, and, thermoluminescence, tl, thermoluminescence, and, optically, stimulated, luminescence, are, used, in, archaeology, to, date, fired, objects, such, as, pottery, or, cooking, stones, and, can, be, used, to, observe, sand, migration, incremental, dating, techniques, allow, the, construction, of, year, by, year, annual, chronologies, which, can, be, fixed, i, e, linked, to, the, present, day, and, thus, calendar, or, sidereal, time, or, floating, a, sequence, of, paleomagnetic, poles, usually, called, virtual, geomagnetic, poles, which, are, already, well, defined, in, age, constitutes, an, apparent, polar, wander, path, apwp, such, a, path, is, constructed, for, a, large, continental, block, apwps, for, different, continents, can, be, used, as, a, reference, for, newly, obtained, poles, for, the, rocks, with, unknown, age, for, paleomagnetic, dating, it, is, suggested, to, use, the, apwp, in, order, to, date, a, pole, obtained, from, rocks, or, sediments, of, unknown, age, by, linking, the, paleopole, to, the, nearest, point, on, the, apwp, two, methods, of, paleomagnetic, dating, have, been, suggested, 1, the, angular, method, and, 2, the, rotation, method, the, first, method, is, used, for, paleomagnetic, dating, of, rocks, inside, of, the, same, continental, block, the, second, method, is, used, for, the, folded, areas, where, tectonic, rotations, are, possible, magnetostratigraphy, determines, age, from, the, pattern, of, magnetic, polarity, zones, in, a, series, of, bedded, sedimentary, and, or, volcanic, rocks, by, comparison, to, the, magnetic, polarity, timescale, the, polarity, timescale, has, been, previously, determined, by, dating, of, seafloor, magnetic, anomalies, radiometrically, dating, volcanic, rocks, within, magnetostratigraphic, sections, and, astronomically, dating, magnetostratigraphic, sections, global, trends, in, isotope, compositions, particularly, carbon, 13, and, strontium, isotopes, can, be, used, to, correlate, strata, marker, horizons, are, stratigraphic, units, of, the, same, age, and, of, such, distinctive, composition, and, appearance, that, despite, their, presence, in, different, geographic, sites, there, is, certainty, about, their, age, equivalence, fossil, faunal, and, floral, assemblages, both, marine, and, terrestrial, make, for, distinctive, marker, horizons, tephrochronology, is, a, method, for, geochemical, correlation, of, unknown, volcanic, ash, tephra, to, geochemically, fingerprinted, dated, tephra, tephra, is, also, often, used, as, a, dating, tool, in, archaeology, since, the, dates, of, some, eruptions, are, well, established, geochronology, from, largest, to, smallest, it, is, important, not, to, confuse, geochronologic, and, chronostratigraphic, units, geochronological, units, are, periods, of, time, thus, it, is, correct, to, say, that, tyrannosaurus, rex, lived, during, the, late, cretaceous, epoch, chronostratigraphic, units, are, geological, material, so, it, is, also, correct, to, say, that, fossils, of, the, genus, tyrannosaurus, have, been, found, in, the, upper, cretaceous, series, in, the, same, way, it, is, entirely, possible, to, go, and, visit, an, upper, cretaceous, series, deposit, such, as, the, hell, creek, deposit, where, the, tyrannosaurus, fossils, were, found, but, it, is, naturally, impossible, to, visit, the, late, cretaceous, epoch, as, that, is, a, period, of, time
