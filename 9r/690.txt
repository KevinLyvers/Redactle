the, cenozoic, s, i, n, z, o, k, s, n, see, n, zoh, ik, sen, lit, new, life, is, earth, s, current, geological, era, representing, the, last, 66, million, years, of, earth, s, history, it, is, characterized, by, the, dominance, of, mammals, birds, conifers, and, angiosperms, flowering, plants, it, is, the, latest, of, three, geological, eras, preceded, by, the, mesozoic, and, paleozoic, the, cenozoic, started, with, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, when, many, species, including, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, became, extinct, in, an, event, attributed, by, most, experts, to, the, impact, of, a, large, asteroid, or, other, celestial, body, the, chicxulub, impactor, the, cenozoic, is, also, known, as, the, age, of, mammals, because, the, terrestrial, animals, that, dominated, both, hemispheres, were, mammals, the, eutherians, placentals, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, metatherians, marsupials, now, mainly, restricted, to, australia, and, to, some, extent, south, america, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, extinction, of, many, groups, allowed, mammals, and, birds, to, greatly, diversify, so, that, large, mammals, and, birds, dominated, life, on, earth, the, continents, also, moved, into, their, current, positions, during, this, era, the, climate, during, the, early, cenozoic, was, warmer, than, today, particularly, during, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, however, the, eocene, to, oligocene, transition, and, the, quaternary, glaciation, dried, and, cooled, earth, cenozoic, derives, from, the, greek, words, kain, s, new, and, z, life, the, name, was, proposed, in, 1840, by, the, british, geologist, john, phillips, 1800, 1874, who, originally, spelled, it, kainozoic, the, era, is, also, known, as, the, c, nozoic, caenozoic, or, cainozoic, k, a, n, z, o, k, k, e, in, name, the, cenozoic, lit, new, life, is, comparable, to, the, preceding, mesozoic, middle, life, and, paleozoic, old, life, eras, as, well, as, to, the, proterozoic, earlier, life, eon, the, cenozoic, is, divided, into, three, periods, the, paleogene, neogene, and, quaternary, and, seven, epochs, the, paleocene, eocene, oligocene, miocene, pliocene, pleistocene, and, holocene, the, quaternary, period, was, officially, recognised, by, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, in, june, 2009, in, 2004, the, tertiary, period, was, officially, replaced, by, the, paleogene, and, neogene, periods, the, common, use, of, epochs, during, the, cenozoic, helps, palaeontologists, better, organise, and, group, the, many, significant, events, that, occurred, during, this, comparatively, short, interval, of, time, knowledge, of, this, era, is, more, detailed, than, any, other, era, because, of, the, relatively, young, well, preserved, rocks, associated, with, it, the, paleogene, spans, from, the, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, 66, million, years, ago, to, the, dawn, of, the, neogene, 23, 03, million, years, ago, it, features, three, epochs, the, paleocene, eocene, and, oligocene, the, paleocene, epoch, lasted, from, 66, million, to, 56, million, years, ago, modern, placental, mammals, originated, during, this, time, the, devastation, of, the, k, pg, extinction, event, included, the, extinction, of, large, herbivores, which, permitted, the, spread, of, dense, but, usually, species, poor, forests, the, early, paleocene, saw, the, recovery, of, earth, the, continents, began, to, take, their, modern, shape, but, all, the, continents, and, the, subcontinent, of, india, were, separated, from, each, other, afro, eurasia, was, separated, by, the, tethys, sea, and, the, americas, were, separated, by, the, strait, of, panama, as, the, isthmus, had, not, yet, formed, this, epoch, featured, a, general, warming, trend, with, jungles, eventually, reaching, the, poles, the, oceans, were, dominated, by, sharks, as, the, large, reptiles, that, had, once, predominated, were, extinct, archaic, mammals, filled, the, world, such, as, creodonts, extinct, carnivores, unrelated, to, existing, carnivora, the, eocene, epoch, ranged, from, 56, million, years, to, 33, 9, million, years, ago, in, the, early, eocene, species, living, in, dense, forest, were, unable, to, evolve, into, larger, forms, as, in, the, paleocene, among, them, were, early, primates, whales, and, horses, along, with, many, other, early, forms, of, mammals, at, the, top, of, the, food, chains, were, huge, birds, such, as, paracrax, carbon, dioxide, levels, were, approximately, 1, 400, ppm, the, temperature, was, 30, degrees, celsius, with, little, temperature, gradient, from, pole, to, pole, in, the, mid, eocene, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, between, australia, and, antarctica, formed, this, disrupted, ocean, currents, worldwide, and, as, a, result, caused, a, global, cooling, effect, shrinking, the, jungles, this, allowed, mammals, to, grow, to, mammoth, proportions, such, as, whales, which, by, that, time, had, become, almost, fully, aquatic, mammals, like, andrewsarchus, were, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, the, late, eocene, saw, the, rebirth, of, seasons, which, caused, the, expansion, of, savanna, like, areas, along, with, the, evolution, of, grasses, the, end, of, the, eocene, was, marked, by, the, eocene, oligocene, extinction, event, the, european, face, of, which, is, known, as, the, grande, coupure, the, oligocene, epoch, spans, from, 33, 9, million, to, 23, 03, million, years, ago, the, oligocene, featured, the, expansion, of, grasslands, which, had, led, to, many, new, species, to, evolve, including, the, first, elephants, cats, dogs, marsupials, and, many, other, species, still, prevalent, today, many, other, species, of, plants, evolved, in, this, period, too, a, cooling, period, featuring, seasonal, rains, was, still, in, effect, mammals, still, continued, to, grow, larger, and, larger, the, neogene, spans, from, 23, 03, million, to, 2, 58, million, years, ago, it, features, 2, epochs, the, miocene, and, the, pliocene, the, miocene, epoch, spans, from, 23, 03, to, 5, 333, million, years, ago, and, is, a, period, in, which, grasses, spread, further, dominating, a, large, portion, of, the, world, at, the, expense, of, forests, kelp, forests, evolved, encouraging, the, evolution, of, new, species, such, as, sea, otters, during, this, time, perissodactyla, thrived, and, evolved, into, many, different, varieties, apes, evolved, into, 30, species, the, tethys, sea, finally, closed, with, the, creation, of, the, arabian, peninsula, leaving, only, remnants, as, the, black, red, mediterranean, and, caspian, seas, this, increased, aridity, many, new, plants, evolved, 95, of, modern, seed, plants, families, were, present, by, the, end, of, the, miocene, the, pliocene, epoch, lasted, from, 5, 333, to, 2, 58, million, years, ago, the, pliocene, featured, dramatic, climatic, changes, which, ultimately, led, to, modern, species, of, flora, and, fauna, the, mediterranean, sea, dried, up, for, several, million, years, because, the, ice, ages, reduced, sea, levels, disconnecting, the, atlantic, from, the, mediterranean, and, evaporation, rates, exceeded, inflow, from, rivers, australopithecus, evolved, in, africa, beginning, the, human, branch, the, isthmus, of, panama, formed, and, animals, migrated, between, north, and, south, america, during, the, great, american, interchange, wreaking, havoc, on, local, ecologies, climatic, changes, brought, savannas, that, are, still, continuing, to, spread, across, the, world, indian, monsoons, deserts, in, central, asia, and, the, beginnings, of, the, sahara, desert, the, world, map, has, not, changed, much, since, save, for, changes, brought, about, by, the, glaciations, of, the, quaternary, such, as, the, great, lakes, hudson, bay, and, the, baltic, sea, the, quaternary, spans, from, 2, 58, million, years, ago, to, present, day, and, is, the, shortest, geological, period, in, the, phanerozoic, eon, it, features, modern, animals, and, dramatic, changes, in, the, climate, it, is, divided, into, two, epochs, the, pleistocene, and, the, holocene, the, pleistocene, lasted, from, 2, 58, million, to, 11, 700, years, ago, this, epoch, was, marked, by, ice, ages, as, a, result, of, the, cooling, trend, that, started, in, the, mid, eocene, there, were, at, least, four, separate, glaciation, periods, marked, by, the, advance, of, ice, caps, as, far, south, as, 40, n, in, mountainous, areas, meanwhile, africa, experienced, a, trend, of, desiccation, which, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, sahara, namib, and, kalahari, deserts, many, animals, evolved, including, mammoths, giant, ground, sloths, dire, wolves, sabre, toothed, cats, and, homo, sapiens, 100, 000, years, ago, marked, the, end, of, one, of, the, worst, droughts, in, africa, and, led, to, the, expansion, of, primitive, humans, as, the, pleistocene, drew, to, a, close, a, major, extinction, wiped, out, much, of, the, world, s, megafauna, including, some, of, the, hominid, species, such, as, neanderthals, all, the, continents, were, affected, but, africa, to, a, lesser, extent, it, still, retains, many, large, animals, such, as, hippos, the, holocene, began, 11, 700, years, ago, and, lasts, to, the, present, day, all, recorded, history, and, the, human, history, lies, within, the, boundaries, of, the, holocene, epoch, human, activity, is, blamed, for, a, mass, extinction, that, began, roughly, 10, 000, years, ago, though, the, species, becoming, extinct, have, only, been, recorded, since, the, industrial, revolution, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, sixth, extinction, it, is, often, cited, that, over, 322, recorded, species, have, become, extinct, due, to, human, activity, since, the, industrial, revolution, but, the, rate, may, be, as, high, as, 500, vertebrate, species, alone, the, majority, of, which, have, occurred, after, 1900, geologically, the, cenozoic, is, the, era, when, the, continents, moved, into, their, current, positions, australia, new, guinea, having, split, from, pangea, during, the, early, cretaceous, drifted, north, and, eventually, collided, with, southeast, asia, antarctica, moved, into, its, current, position, over, the, south, pole, the, atlantic, ocean, widened, and, later, in, the, era, 2, 8, million, years, ago, south, america, became, attached, to, north, america, with, the, isthmus, of, panama, india, collided, with, asia, 55, to, 45, million, years, ago, creating, the, himalayas, arabia, collided, with, eurasia, closing, the, tethys, ocean, and, creating, the, zagros, mountains, around, 35, million, years, ago, the, break, up, of, gondwana, in, late, cretaceous, and, cenozoic, times, led, to, a, shift, in, the, river, courses, of, various, large, african, rivers, including, the, congo, niger, nile, orange, limpopo, and, zambezi, in, the, cretaceous, the, climate, was, hot, and, humid, with, lush, forests, at, the, poles, there, was, no, permanent, ice, and, sea, levels, were, around, 300, metres, higher, than, today, this, continued, for, the, first, 10, million, years, of, the, paleocene, culminating, in, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, about, 55, 5, million, years, ago, around, 50, million, years, ago, earth, entered, a, period, of, long, term, cooling, this, was, mainly, due, to, the, collision, of, india, with, eurasia, which, caused, the, rise, of, the, himalayas, the, upraised, rocks, eroded, and, reacted, with, co, 2, in, the, air, causing, a, long, term, reduction, in, the, proportion, of, this, greenhouse, gas, in, the, atmosphere, around, 35, million, years, ago, permanent, ice, began, to, build, up, on, antarctica, the, cooling, trend, continued, in, the, miocene, with, relatively, short, warmer, periods, when, south, america, became, attached, to, north, america, creating, the, isthmus, of, panama, around, 2, 8, million, years, ago, the, arctic, region, cooled, due, to, the, strengthening, of, the, humboldt, and, gulf, stream, currents, eventually, leading, to, the, glaciations, of, the, quaternary, ice, age, the, current, interglacial, of, which, is, the, holocene, epoch, recent, analysis, of, the, geomagnetic, reversal, frequency, oxygen, isotope, record, and, tectonic, plate, subduction, rate, which, are, indicators, of, the, changes, in, the, heat, flux, at, the, core, mantle, boundary, climate, and, plate, tectonic, activity, shows, that, all, these, changes, indicate, similar, rhythms, on, million, years, timescale, in, the, cenozoic, era, occurring, with, the, common, fundamental, periodicity, of, 13, myr, during, most, of, the, time, the, levels, of, carbonate, ions, in, the, ocean, fell, over, the, course, of, the, cenozoic, early, in, the, cenozoic, following, the, k, pg, event, the, planet, was, dominated, by, relatively, small, fauna, including, small, mammals, birds, reptiles, and, amphibians, from, a, geological, perspective, it, did, not, take, long, for, mammals, and, birds, to, greatly, diversify, in, the, absence, of, the, dinosaurs, that, had, dominated, during, the, mesozoic, some, flightless, birds, grew, larger, than, humans, these, species, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, terror, birds, and, were, formidable, predators, mammals, came, to, occupy, almost, every, available, niche, both, marine, and, terrestrial, and, some, also, grew, very, large, attaining, sizes, not, seen, in, most, of, today, s, terrestrial, mammals, the, ranges, of, many, cenozoic, bird, clades, were, governed, by, latitude, and, temperature, and, have, contracted, over, the, course, of, this, era, as, the, world, cooled, during, the, cenozoic, mammals, proliferated, from, a, few, small, simple, generalised, forms, into, a, diverse, collection, of, terrestrial, marine, and, flying, animals, giving, this, period, its, other, name, the, age, of, mammals, the, cenozoic, is, just, as, much, the, age, of, savannas, the, age, of, co, dependent, flowering, plants, and, insects, and, the, age, of, birds, grasses, also, played, a, very, important, role, in, this, era, shaping, the, evolution, of, the, birds, and, mammals, that, fed, on, them, one, group, that, diversified, significantly, in, the, cenozoic, as, well, were, the, snakes, evolving, in, the, cenozoic, the, variety, of, snakes, increased, tremendously, resulting, in, many, colubrids, following, the, evolution, of, their, current, primary, prey, source, the, rodents, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, cenozoic, the, world, was, dominated, by, the, gastornithid, birds, terrestrial, crocodiles, like, pristichampsus, large, sharks, such, as, otodus, and, a, handful, of, primitive, large, mammal, groups, like, uintatheres, mesonychians, and, pantodonts, but, as, the, forests, began, to, recede, and, the, climate, began, to, cool, other, mammals, took, over, the, cenozoic, is, full, of, mammals, both, strange, and, familiar, including, chalicotheres, creodonts, whales, primates, entelodonts, sabre, toothed, cats, mastodons, and, mammoths, three, toed, horses, giant, rhinoceros, like, paraceratherium, the, rhinoceros, like, brontotheres, various, bizarre, groups, of, mammals, from, south, america, such, as, the, vaguely, elephant, like, pyrotheres, and, the, dog, like, marsupial, relatives, called, borhyaenids, and, the, monotremes, and, marsupials, of, australia, mammal, evolution, in, the, cenozoic, was, predominantly, shaped, by, climatic, and, geological, processes, cenozoic, calcareous, nannoplankton, experienced, rapid, rates, of, speciation, and, reduced, species, longevity, while, suffering, prolonged, declines, in, diversity, during, the, eocene, and, neogene, diatoms, in, contrast, experienced, major, diversification, over, the, eocene, especially, at, high, latitudes, as, the, world, s, oceans, cooled, diatom, diversification, was, particularly, concentrated, at, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, a, second, major, pulse, of, diatom, diversification, occurred, over, the, course, of, the, middle, and, late, miocene
