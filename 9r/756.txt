frost, is, a, thin, layer, of, ice, on, a, solid, surface, which, forms, from, water, vapor, that, deposits, onto, a, freezing, surface, frost, forms, when, the, air, contains, more, water, vapor, than, it, can, normally, hold, at, a, specific, temperature, the, process, is, similar, to, the, formation, of, dew, except, it, occurs, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, typically, without, crossing, through, a, liquid, state, air, always, contains, a, certain, amount, of, water, vapor, depending, on, temperature, warmer, air, can, hold, more, than, colder, air, when, the, atmosphere, contains, more, water, than, it, can, hold, at, a, specific, temperature, its, relative, humidity, rises, above, 100, becoming, supersaturated, and, the, excess, water, vapor, is, forced, to, deposit, onto, any, nearby, surface, forming, seed, crystals, the, temperature, at, which, frost, will, form, is, called, the, dew, point, and, depends, on, the, humidity, of, the, air, when, the, temperature, of, the, air, drops, below, its, dew, point, excess, water, vapor, is, forced, out, of, solution, resulting, in, a, phase, change, directly, from, water, vapor, a, gas, to, ice, a, solid, as, more, water, molecules, are, added, to, the, seeds, crystal, growth, occurs, forming, ice, crystals, crystals, may, vary, in, size, and, shape, from, an, even, layer, of, numerous, microscopic, seeds, to, fewer, but, much, larger, crystals, ranging, from, long, dendritic, crystals, tree, like, growing, across, a, surface, acicular, crystals, needle, like, growing, outward, from, the, surface, snowflake, shaped, crystals, or, even, large, knifelike, blades, of, ice, covering, an, object, which, depends, on, many, factors, such, as, temperature, air, pressure, air, motion, and, turbulence, surface, roughness, and, wettability, and, the, level, of, supersaturation, for, example, water, vapor, adsorbs, to, glass, very, well, so, automobile, windows, will, often, frost, before, the, paint, and, large, hoar, frost, crystals, can, grow, very, rapidly, when, the, air, is, very, cold, calm, and, heavily, saturated, such, as, during, an, ice, fog, frost, may, occur, when, warm, moist, air, comes, into, contact, with, a, cold, surface, cooling, it, below, its, dew, point, such, as, warm, breath, on, a, freezing, window, in, the, atmosphere, it, more, often, occurs, when, both, the, air, and, the, surface, are, below, freezing, when, the, air, experiences, a, drop, in, temperature, bringing, it, below, its, dew, point, for, example, when, the, temperature, falls, after, the, sun, sets, in, temperate, climates, it, most, commonly, appears, on, surfaces, near, the, ground, as, fragile, white, crystals, in, cold, climates, it, occurs, in, a, greater, variety, of, forms, the, propagation, of, crystal, formation, occurs, by, the, process, of, nucleation, in, specific, water, nucleation, which, is, the, same, phenomenon, responsible, for, the, formation, of, clouds, fog, snow, rain, and, other, meteorological, phenomena, the, ice, crystals, of, frost, form, as, the, result, of, fractal, process, development, the, depth, of, frost, crystals, varies, depending, on, the, amount, of, time, they, have, been, accumulating, and, the, concentration, of, the, water, vapor, humidity, frost, crystals, may, be, invisible, black, clear, translucent, or, if, a, mass, of, frost, crystals, scatters, light, in, all, directions, the, coating, of, frost, appears, white, types, of, frost, include, crystalline, frost, hoar, frost, or, radiation, frost, from, deposition, of, water, vapor, from, air, of, low, humidity, white, frost, in, humid, conditions, window, frost, on, glass, surfaces, advection, frost, from, cold, wind, over, cold, surfaces, black, frost, without, visible, ice, at, low, temperatures, and, very, low, humidity, and, rime, under, supercooled, wet, conditions, plants, that, have, evolved, in, warmer, climates, suffer, damage, when, the, temperature, falls, low, enough, to, freeze, the, water, in, the, cells, that, make, up, the, plant, tissue, the, tissue, damage, resulting, from, this, process, is, known, as, frost, damage, farmers, in, those, regions, where, frost, damage, has, been, known, to, affect, their, crops, often, invest, in, substantial, means, to, protect, their, crops, from, such, damage, if, a, solid, surface, is, chilled, below, the, dew, point, of, the, surrounding, humid, air, and, the, surface, itself, is, colder, than, freezing, ice, will, form, on, it, if, the, water, deposits, as, a, liquid, that, then, freezes, it, forms, a, coating, that, may, look, glassy, opaque, or, crystalline, depending, on, its, type, depending, on, context, that, process, may, also, be, called, atmospheric, icing, the, ice, it, produces, differs, in, some, ways, from, crystalline, frost, which, consists, of, spicules, of, ice, that, typically, project, from, the, solid, surface, on, which, they, grow, the, main, difference, between, the, ice, coatings, and, frost, spicules, arises, because, the, crystalline, spicules, grow, directly, from, desublimation, of, water, vapour, from, air, and, desublimation, is, not, a, factor, in, icing, of, freezing, surfaces, for, desublimation, to, proceed, the, surface, must, be, below, the, frost, point, of, the, air, meaning, that, it, is, sufficiently, cold, for, ice, to, form, without, passing, through, the, liquid, phase, the, air, must, be, humid, but, not, sufficiently, humid, to, permit, the, condensation, of, liquid, water, or, icing, will, result, instead, of, desublimation, the, size, of, the, crystals, depends, largely, on, the, temperature, the, amount, of, water, vapor, available, and, how, long, they, have, been, growing, undisturbed, as, a, rule, except, in, conditions, where, supercooled, droplets, are, present, in, the, air, frost, will, form, only, if, the, deposition, surface, is, colder, than, the, surrounding, air, for, instance, frost, may, be, observed, around, cracks, in, cold, wooden, sidewalks, when, humid, air, escapes, from, the, warmer, ground, beneath, other, objects, on, which, frost, commonly, forms, are, those, with, low, specific, heat, or, high, thermal, emissivity, such, as, blackened, metals, hence, the, accumulation, of, frost, on, the, heads, of, rusty, nails, the, apparently, erratic, occurrence, of, frost, in, adjacent, localities, is, due, partly, to, differences, of, elevation, the, lower, areas, becoming, colder, on, calm, nights, where, static, air, settles, above, an, area, of, ground, in, the, absence, of, wind, the, absorptivity, and, specific, heat, of, the, ground, strongly, influence, the, temperature, that, the, trapped, air, attains, hoar, frost, also, hoarfrost, radiation, frost, or, pruina, refers, to, white, ice, crystals, deposited, on, the, ground, or, loosely, attached, to, exposed, objects, such, as, wires, or, leaves, they, form, on, cold, clear, nights, when, conditions, are, such, that, heat, radiates, into, outer, space, faster, than, it, can, be, replaced, from, nearby, warm, objects, or, brought, in, by, the, wind, under, suitable, circumstances, objects, cool, to, below, the, frost, point, of, the, surrounding, air, well, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, such, freezing, may, be, promoted, by, effects, such, as, flood, frost, or, frost, pocket, these, occur, when, ground, level, radiation, cools, air, until, it, flows, downhill, and, accumulates, in, pockets, of, very, cold, air, in, valleys, and, hollows, hoar, frost, may, freeze, in, such, low, lying, cold, air, even, when, the, air, temperature, a, few, feet, above, ground, is, well, above, freezing, the, word, hoar, comes, from, an, old, english, adjective, that, means, showing, signs, of, old, age, in, this, context, it, refers, to, the, frost, that, makes, trees, and, bushes, look, like, white, hair, hoar, frost, may, have, different, names, depending, on, where, it, forms, when, surface, hoar, covers, sloping, snowbanks, the, layer, of, frost, crystals, may, create, an, avalanche, risk, when, heavy, layers, of, new, snow, cover, the, frosty, surface, furry, crystals, standing, out, from, the, old, snow, hold, off, the, falling, flakes, forming, a, layer, of, voids, that, prevents, the, new, snow, layers, from, bonding, strongly, to, the, old, snow, beneath, ideal, conditions, for, hoarfrost, to, form, on, snow, are, cold, clear, nights, with, very, light, cold, air, currents, conveying, humidity, at, the, right, rate, for, growth, of, frost, crystals, wind, that, is, too, strong, or, warm, destroys, the, furry, crystals, and, thereby, may, permit, a, stronger, bond, between, the, old, and, new, snow, layers, however, if, the, winds, are, strong, enough, and, cold, enough, to, lay, the, crystals, flat, and, dry, carpeting, the, snow, with, cold, loose, crystals, without, removing, or, destroying, them, or, letting, them, warm, up, and, become, sticky, then, the, frost, interface, between, the, snow, layers, may, still, present, an, avalanche, danger, because, the, texture, of, the, frost, crystals, differs, from, the, snow, texture, and, the, dry, crystals, will, not, stick, to, fresh, snow, such, conditions, still, prevent, a, strong, bond, between, the, snow, layers, in, very, low, temperatures, where, fluffy, surface, hoar, crystals, form, without, subsequently, being, covered, with, snow, strong, winds, may, break, them, off, forming, a, dust, of, ice, particles, and, blowing, them, over, the, surface, the, ice, dust, then, may, form, yukimarimo, as, has, been, observed, in, parts, of, antarctica, in, a, process, similar, to, the, formation, of, dust, bunnies, and, similar, structures, hoar, frost, and, white, frost, also, occur, in, man, made, environments, such, as, in, freezers, or, industrial, cold, storage, facilities, if, such, cold, spaces, or, the, pipes, serving, them, are, not, well, insulated, and, are, exposed, to, ambient, humidity, the, moisture, will, freeze, instantly, depending, on, the, freezer, temperature, the, frost, may, coat, pipes, thickly, partly, insulating, them, but, such, inefficient, insulation, still, is, a, source, of, heat, loss, advection, frost, also, called, wind, frost, refers, to, tiny, ice, spikes, that, form, when, very, cold, wind, is, blowing, over, tree, branches, poles, and, other, surfaces, it, looks, like, rimming, on, the, edges, of, flowers, and, leaves, and, usually, forms, against, the, direction, of, the, wind, it, can, occur, at, any, hour, day, or, night, window, frost, also, called, fern, frost, or, ice, flowers, forms, when, a, glass, pane, is, exposed, to, very, cold, air, on, the, outside, and, warmer, moderately, moist, air, on, the, inside, if, the, pane, is, a, bad, insulator, for, example, if, it, is, a, single, pane, window, water, vapour, condenses, on, the, glass, forming, frost, patterns, with, very, low, temperatures, outside, frost, can, appear, on, the, bottom, of, the, window, even, with, double, pane, energy, efficient, windows, because, the, air, convection, between, two, panes, of, glass, ensures, that, the, bottom, part, of, the, glazing, unit, is, colder, than, the, top, part, on, unheated, motor, vehicles, the, frost, usually, forms, on, the, outside, surface, of, the, glass, first, the, glass, surface, influences, the, shape, of, crystals, so, imperfections, scratches, or, dust, can, modify, the, way, ice, nucleates, the, patterns, in, window, frost, form, a, fractal, with, a, fractal, dimension, greater, than, one, but, less, than, two, this, is, a, consequence, of, the, nucleation, process, being, constrained, to, unfold, in, two, dimensions, unlike, a, snowflake, which, is, shaped, by, a, similar, process, but, forms, in, three, dimensions, and, has, a, fractal, dimension, greater, than, two, if, the, indoor, air, is, very, humid, rather, than, moderately, so, water, first, condenses, in, small, droplets, and, then, freezes, into, clear, ice, similar, patterns, of, freezing, may, occur, on, other, smooth, vertical, surfaces, but, they, seldom, are, as, obvious, or, spectacular, as, on, clear, glass, white, frost, is, a, solid, deposition, of, ice, that, forms, directly, from, water, vapour, contained, in, air, white, frost, forms, when, relative, humidity, is, above, 90, and, the, temperature, below, 8, c, 18, f, and, it, grows, against, the, wind, direction, since, air, arriving, from, windward, has, a, higher, humidity, than, leeward, air, but, the, wind, must, not, be, strong, else, it, damages, the, delicate, icy, structures, as, they, begin, to, form, white, frost, resembles, a, heavy, coating, of, hoar, frost, with, big, interlocking, crystals, usually, needle, shaped, rime, is, a, type, of, ice, deposition, that, occurs, quickly, often, under, heavily, humid, and, windy, conditions, technically, speaking, it, is, not, a, type, of, frost, since, usually, supercooled, water, drops, are, involved, in, contrast, to, the, formation, of, hoar, frost, in, which, water, vapour, desublimates, slowly, and, directly, ships, travelling, through, arctic, seas, may, accumulate, large, quantities, of, rime, on, the, rigging, unlike, hoar, frost, which, has, a, feathery, appearance, rime, generally, has, an, icy, solid, appearance, black, frost, or, killing, frost, is, not, strictly, speaking, frost, at, all, because, it, is, the, condition, seen, in, crops, when, the, humidity, is, too, low, for, frost, to, form, but, the, temperature, falls, so, low, that, plant, tissues, freeze, and, die, becoming, blackened, hence, the, term, black, frost, black, frost, often, is, called, killing, frost, because, white, frost, tends, to, be, less, cold, partly, because, the, latent, heat, of, freezing, of, the, water, reduces, the, temperature, drop, many, plants, can, be, damaged, or, killed, by, freezing, temperatures, or, frost, this, varies, with, the, type, of, plant, the, tissue, exposed, and, how, low, temperatures, get, a, light, frost, of, 2, to, 0, c, 28, to, 32, f, damages, fewer, types, of, plants, than, a, hard, frost, below, 2, c, 28, f, plants, likely, to, be, damaged, even, by, a, light, frost, include, vines, such, as, beans, grapes, squashes, melons, along, with, nightshades, such, as, tomatoes, eggplants, and, peppers, plants, that, may, tolerate, or, even, benefit, from, frosts, include, even, those, plants, that, tolerate, frost, may, be, damaged, once, temperatures, drop, even, lower, below, 4, c, or, 25, f, hardy, perennials, such, as, hosta, become, dormant, after, the, first, frosts, and, regrow, when, spring, arrives, the, entire, visible, plant, may, turn, completely, brown, until, the, spring, warmth, or, may, drop, all, of, its, leaves, and, flowers, leaving, the, stem, and, stalk, only, evergreen, plants, such, as, pine, trees, withstand, frost, although, all, or, most, growth, stops, frost, crack, is, a, bark, defect, caused, by, a, combination, of, low, temperatures, and, heat, from, the, winter, sun, vegetation, is, not, necessarily, damaged, when, leaf, temperatures, drop, below, the, freezing, point, of, their, cell, contents, in, the, absence, of, a, site, nucleating, the, formation, of, ice, crystals, the, leaves, remain, in, a, supercooled, liquid, state, safely, reaching, temperatures, of, 4, to, 12, c, 25, to, 10, f, however, once, frost, forms, the, leaf, cells, may, be, damaged, by, sharp, ice, crystals, hardening, is, the, process, by, which, a, plant, becomes, tolerant, to, low, temperatures, see, also, cryobiology, certain, bacteria, notably, pseudomonas, syringae, are, particularly, effective, at, triggering, frost, formation, raising, the, nucleation, temperature, to, about, 2, c, 28, f, bacteria, lacking, ice, nucleation, active, proteins, ice, minus, bacteria, result, in, greatly, reduced, frost, damage, typical, measures, to, prevent, frost, or, reduce, its, severity, include, one, or, more, of, such, measures, need, to, be, applied, with, discretion, because, they, may, do, more, harm, than, good, for, example, spraying, crops, with, water, can, cause, damage, if, the, plants, become, overburdened, with, ice, an, effective, low, cost, method, for, small, crop, farms, and, plant, nurseries, exploits, the, latent, heat, of, freezing, a, pulsed, irrigation, timer, delivers, water, through, existing, overhead, sprinklers, at, a, low, volumes, to, combat, frosts, down, to, 5, c, 23, f, if, the, water, freezes, it, gives, off, its, latent, heat, preventing, the, temperature, of, the, foliage, from, falling, much, below, zero, frost, free, areas, are, found, mainly, in, the, lowland, tropics, where, they, cover, almost, all, land, except, at, altitudes, above, about, 3, 000, metres, or, 9, 800, feet, near, the, equator, and, around, 2, 000, metres, or, 6, 600, feet, in, the, semiarid, areas, in, tropical, regions, some, areas, on, the, oceanic, margins, of, the, subtropics, are, also, frost, free, as, are, highly, oceanic, areas, near, windward, coasts, the, most, poleward, frost, free, areas, are, the, lower, altitudes, of, the, azores, le, amsterdam, le, saint, paul, and, tristan, da, cunha, in, the, contiguous, united, states, southern, florida, around, miami, beach, and, the, florida, keys, are, the, only, reliably, frost, free, areas, as, well, as, the, channel, islands, off, the, coast, of, california, the, hardiness, zones, in, these, regions, are, 11a, and, 11b, permafrost, is, a, layer, of, frozen, earth, underground, which, never, heats, above, freezing, even, during, summer, months, remaining, frozen, year, round, although, not, frost, in, the, atmospheric, sense, it, consists, of, dirt, soil, sand, rocks, clay, or, organic, matter, peat, bound, firmly, together, by, ice, crystals, making, the, material, very, hard, and, difficult, to, penetrate, permafrost, exists, in, the, colder, climates, of, the, arctic, and, antarctic, such, as, russia, canada, alaska, norway, greenland, or, antarctica, where, the, warmer, conditions, of, summer, are, insufficient, to, penetrate, the, insulation, of, the, earth, to, reach, deep, enough, to, thaw, the, permafrost, layer, the, permafrost, may, begin, from, the, surface, of, the, ground, or, many, meters, beneath, it, and, may, extend, from, just, a, meter, to, over, a, thousand, meters, in, thickness, permafrost, contains, a, significant, portion, of, the, earth, s, water, and, carbon, and, prevents, surface, water, from, penetrating, very, deep, into, the, ground, making, it, responsible, in, part, for, the, typical, taiga, and, spruce, bog, environments, common, in, northern, latitudes, frost, is, personified, in, russian, culture, as, ded, moroz, indigenous, peoples, of, russia, such, as, the, mordvins, have, their, own, traditions, of, frost, deities, english, folklore, tradition, holds, that, jack, frost, an, elfish, creature, is, responsible, for, feathery, patterns, of, frost, found, on, windows, on, cold, mornings, in, 2024, two, european, space, agency, spacecraft, exomars, tgo, and, mars, express, discovered, a, thin, but, very, wide, layer, of, water, frost, on, the, peak, of, olympus, mons, the, highest, mountain, on, mars, this, layer, of, frost, appears, for, a, few, hours, around, sunrise, and, then, evaporates, into, the, atmosphere, for, the, rest, of, the, martian, day, this, was, the, first, instance, of, frost, discovered, in, the, equatorial, region, of, mars
