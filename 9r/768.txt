the, walker, circulation, also, known, as, the, walker, cell, is, a, conceptual, model, of, the, air, flow, in, the, tropics, in, the, lower, atmosphere, troposphere, according, to, this, model, parcels, of, air, follow, a, closed, circulation, in, the, zonal, and, vertical, directions, this, circulation, which, is, roughly, consistent, with, observations, is, caused, by, differences, in, heat, distribution, between, ocean, and, land, in, addition, to, motions, in, the, zonal, and, vertical, direction, the, tropical, atmosphere, also, has, considerable, motion, in, the, meridional, direction, as, part, of, for, example, the, hadley, circulation, the, walker, circulation, is, associated, with, the, pressure, gradient, force, that, results, from, a, high, pressure, system, over, the, eastern, pacific, ocean, and, a, low, pressure, system, over, indonesia, the, walker, circulations, of, the, tropical, indian, pacific, and, atlantic, basins, result, in, westerly, surface, winds, in, northern, summer, in, the, first, basin, and, easterly, winds, in, the, second, and, third, basins, as, a, result, the, temperature, structure, of, the, three, oceans, display, dramatic, asymmetries, the, equatorial, pacific, and, atlantic, both, have, cool, surface, temperatures, in, northern, summer, in, the, east, while, cooler, surface, temperatures, prevail, only, in, the, western, indian, ocean, these, changes, in, surface, temperature, reflect, changes, in, the, depth, of, the, thermocline, changes, in, the, walker, circulation, with, time, occur, in, conjunction, with, changes, in, surface, temperature, some, of, these, changes, are, forced, externally, such, as, the, seasonal, shift, of, the, sun, into, the, northern, hemisphere, in, summer, other, changes, appear, to, be, the, result, of, coupled, ocean, atmosphere, feedback, in, which, for, example, easterly, winds, cause, the, sea, surface, temperature, to, fall, in, the, east, enhancing, the, zonal, heat, contrast, and, hence, intensifying, easterly, winds, across, the, basin, these, anomalous, easterlies, induce, more, equatorial, upwelling, and, raise, the, thermocline, in, the, east, amplifying, the, initial, cooling, by, the, southerlies, from, an, oceanographic, point, of, view, the, equatorial, cold, tongue, is, caused, by, easterly, winds, were, the, earth, climate, symmetric, about, the, equator, cross, equatorial, wind, would, vanish, and, the, cold, tongue, would, be, much, weaker, and, have, a, very, different, zonal, structure, than, is, observed, today, the, walker, circulation, was, discovered, by, gilbert, walker, the, term, walker, circulation, was, coined, in, 1969, by, the, norwegian, american, meteorologist, jacob, bjerknes, gilbert, walker, was, an, established, applied, mathematician, at, the, university, of, cambridge, when, he, became, director, general, of, observatories, in, india, in, 1904, while, there, he, studied, the, characteristics, of, the, indian, ocean, monsoon, the, failure, of, whose, rains, had, brought, severe, famine, to, the, country, in, 1899, analyzing, vast, amounts, of, weather, data, from, india, and, the, rest, of, the, world, over, the, next, fifteen, years, he, published, the, first, descriptions, of, the, great, seesaw, oscillation, of, atmospheric, pressure, between, the, indian, and, pacific, ocean, and, its, correlation, to, temperature, and, rainfall, patterns, across, much, of, the, earth, s, tropical, regions, including, india, he, also, worked, with, the, indian, meteorological, department, especially, in, linking, the, monsoon, with, southern, oscillation, phenomenon, he, was, made, a, companion, of, the, order, of, the, star, of, india, in, 1911, walker, determined, that, the, time, scale, of, a, year, used, by, many, studying, the, atmosphere, was, unsuitable, because, geospatial, relationships, could, be, entirely, different, depending, on, the, season, thus, walker, broke, his, temporal, analysis, into, december, february, march, may, june, august, and, september, november, walker, then, selected, a, number, of, centers, of, action, which, included, areas, such, as, the, indian, peninsula, the, centers, were, in, the, hearts, of, regions, with, either, permanent, or, seasonal, high, and, low, pressures, he, also, added, points, for, regions, where, rainfall, wind, or, temperature, was, an, important, control, he, examined, the, relationships, of, the, summer, and, winter, values, of, pressure, and, rainfall, first, focusing, on, summer, and, winter, values, and, later, extending, his, work, to, the, spring, and, autumn, he, concludes, that, variations, in, temperature, are, generally, governed, by, variations, in, pressure, and, rainfall, it, had, previously, been, suggested, that, sunspots, could, be, the, cause, of, the, temperature, variations, but, walker, argued, against, this, conclusion, by, showing, monthly, correlations, of, sunspots, with, temperature, winds, cloud, cover, and, rain, that, were, inconsistent, walker, made, it, a, point, to, publish, all, of, his, correlation, findings, both, of, relationships, found, to, be, important, as, well, as, relationships, that, were, found, to, be, unimportant, he, did, this, for, the, purpose, of, dissuading, researchers, from, focusing, on, correlations, that, did, not, exist, the, walker, circulations, of, the, tropical, indian, pacific, and, atlantic, basins, result, in, westerly, surface, winds, in, northern, summer, in, the, first, basin, and, easterly, winds, in, the, second, and, third, basins, as, a, result, the, temperature, structure, of, the, three, oceans, display, dramatic, asymmetries, the, equatorial, pacific, and, atlantic, both, have, cool, surface, temperatures, in, northern, summer, in, the, east, while, cooler, surface, temperatures, prevail, only, in, the, western, indian, ocean, these, changes, in, surface, temperature, reflect, changes, in, the, depth, of, the, thermocline, changes, in, the, walker, circulation, with, time, occur, in, conjunction, with, changes, in, surface, temperature, some, of, these, changes, are, forced, externally, such, as, the, seasonal, shift, of, the, sun, into, the, northern, hemisphere, in, summer, other, changes, appear, to, be, the, result, of, coupled, ocean, atmosphere, feedback, in, which, for, example, easterly, winds, cause, the, sea, surface, temperature, to, fall, in, the, east, enhancing, the, zonal, heat, contrast, and, hence, intensifying, easterly, winds, across, the, basin, these, enhanced, easterlies, induce, more, equatorial, upwelling, and, raise, the, thermocline, in, the, east, amplifying, the, initial, cooling, by, the, southerlies, this, coupled, ocean, atmosphere, feedback, was, originally, proposed, by, bjerknes, from, an, oceanographic, point, of, view, the, equatorial, cold, tongue, is, caused, by, easterly, winds, were, the, earth, climate, symmetric, about, the, equator, cross, equatorial, wind, would, vanish, and, the, cold, tongue, would, be, much, weaker, and, have, a, very, different, zonal, structure, than, is, observed, today, the, walker, cell, is, indirectly, related, to, upwelling, off, the, coasts, of, peru, and, ecuador, this, brings, nutrient, rich, cold, water, to, the, surface, increasing, fishing, stocks, the, walker, circulation, is, caused, by, the, pressure, gradient, force, that, results, from, a, high, pressure, system, over, the, eastern, pacific, ocean, and, a, low, pressure, system, over, indonesia, the, walker, circulation, causes, an, upwelling, of, cold, deep, sea, water, thus, cooling, the, sea, surface, el, ni, o, results, when, this, circulation, decreases, or, stops, as, the, impaired, or, inhibited, circulation, causes, the, ocean, surface, to, warm, to, above, average, temperatures, a, markedly, increased, walker, circulation, causes, a, la, ni, a, by, intensifying, the, upwelling, of, cold, deep, sea, water, which, cools, the, sea, surface, to, below, average, temperatures, during, non, el, ni, o, conditions, the, walker, circulation, is, seen, at, the, surface, as, easterly, trade, winds, that, move, water, and, air, warmed, by, the, sun, toward, the, west, this, also, creates, ocean, upwelling, off, the, coasts, of, peru, and, ecuador, and, brings, nutrient, rich, cold, water, to, the, surface, increasing, fishing, stocks, the, western, side, of, the, equatorial, pacific, is, characterized, by, warm, wet, low, pressure, weather, as, the, collected, moisture, is, dumped, in, the, form, of, typhoons, and, thunderstorms, the, ocean, is, some, 60, cm, 24, in, higher, in, the, western, pacific, as, the, result, of, this, motion, a, scientific, study, published, in, may, 2006, in, the, journal, nature, indicates, that, the, walker, circulation, has, been, slowing, since, the, mid, 19th, century, the, authors, argue, that, global, warming, is, a, likely, causative, factor, in, the, weakening, of, the, wind, pattern, however, a, 2011, study, from, the, twentieth, century, reanalysis, project, shows, that, aside, from, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, cycles, the, overall, speed, and, direction, of, the, walker, circulation, remained, steady, between, 1871, and, 2008
