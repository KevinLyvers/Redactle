silver, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ag, from, latin, argentum, silver, derived, from, proto, indo, european, h, er, shiny, white, and, atomic, number, 47, a, soft, white, lustrous, transition, metal, it, exhibits, the, highest, electrical, conductivity, thermal, conductivity, and, reflectivity, of, any, metal, silver, is, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, in, the, pure, free, elemental, form, native, silver, as, an, alloy, with, gold, and, other, metals, and, in, minerals, such, as, argentite, and, chlorargyrite, most, silver, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, copper, gold, lead, and, zinc, refining, silver, has, long, been, valued, as, a, precious, metal, silver, metal, is, used, in, many, bullion, coins, sometimes, alongside, gold, while, it, is, more, abundant, than, gold, it, is, much, less, abundant, as, a, native, metal, its, purity, is, typically, measured, on, a, per, mille, basis, a, 94, pure, alloy, is, described, as, 0, 940, fine, as, one, of, the, seven, metals, of, antiquity, silver, has, had, an, enduring, role, in, most, human, cultures, other, than, in, currency, and, as, an, investment, medium, coins, and, bullion, silver, is, used, in, solar, panels, water, filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high, value, tableware, and, utensils, hence, the, term, silverware, in, electrical, contacts, and, conductors, in, specialized, mirrors, window, coatings, in, catalysis, of, chemical, reactions, as, a, colorant, in, stained, glass, and, in, specialized, confectionery, its, compounds, are, used, in, photographic, and, x, ray, film, dilute, solutions, of, silver, nitrate, and, other, silver, compounds, are, used, as, disinfectants, and, microbiocides, oligodynamic, effect, added, to, bandages, wound, dressings, catheters, and, other, medical, instruments, silver, is, similar, in, its, physical, and, chemical, properties, to, its, two, vertical, neighbours, in, group, 11, of, the, periodic, table, copper, and, gold, its, 47, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4d, 10, 5s, 1, similarly, to, copper, 3d, 10, 4s, 1, and, gold, 4f, 14, 5d, 10, 6s, 1, group, 11, is, one, of, the, few, groups, in, the, d, block, which, has, a, completely, consistent, set, of, electron, configurations, this, distinctive, electron, configuration, with, a, single, electron, in, the, highest, occupied, s, subshell, over, a, filled, d, subshell, accounts, for, many, of, the, singular, properties, of, metallic, silver, silver, is, a, relatively, soft, and, extremely, ductile, and, malleable, transition, metal, though, it, is, slightly, less, malleable, than, gold, silver, crystallizes, in, a, face, centered, cubic, lattice, with, bulk, coordination, number, 12, where, only, the, single, 5s, electron, is, delocalized, similarly, to, copper, and, gold, unlike, metals, with, incomplete, d, shells, metallic, bonds, in, silver, are, lacking, a, covalent, character, and, are, relatively, weak, this, observation, explains, the, low, hardness, and, high, ductility, of, single, crystals, of, silver, silver, has, a, brilliant, white, metallic, luster, that, can, take, a, high, polish, and, which, is, so, characteristic, that, the, name, of, the, metal, itself, has, become, a, color, name, protected, silver, has, greater, optical, reflectivity, than, aluminium, at, all, wavelengths, longer, than, 450, nm, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 450, nm, silver, s, reflectivity, is, inferior, to, that, of, aluminium, and, drops, to, zero, near, 310, nm, very, high, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, are, common, to, the, elements, in, group, 11, because, their, single, s, electron, is, free, and, does, not, interact, with, the, filled, d, subshell, as, such, interactions, which, occur, in, the, preceding, transition, metals, lower, electron, mobility, the, thermal, conductivity, of, silver, is, among, the, highest, of, all, materials, although, the, thermal, conductivity, of, carbon, in, the, diamond, allotrope, and, superfluid, helium, 4, are, higher, the, electrical, conductivity, of, silver, is, the, highest, of, all, metals, greater, even, than, copper, silver, also, has, the, lowest, contact, resistance, of, any, metal, silver, is, rarely, used, for, its, electrical, conductivity, due, to, its, high, cost, although, an, exception, is, in, radio, frequency, engineering, particularly, at, vhf, and, higher, frequencies, where, silver, plating, improves, electrical, conductivity, because, those, currents, tend, to, flow, on, the, surface, of, conductors, rather, than, through, the, interior, during, world, war, ii, in, the, us, 13540, tons, of, silver, were, used, for, the, electromagnets, in, calutrons, for, enriching, uranium, mainly, because, of, the, wartime, shortage, of, copper, silver, readily, forms, alloys, with, copper, gold, and, zinc, zinc, silver, alloys, with, low, zinc, concentration, may, be, considered, as, face, centred, cubic, solid, solutions, of, zinc, in, silver, as, the, structure, of, the, silver, is, largely, unchanged, while, the, electron, concentration, rises, as, more, zinc, is, added, increasing, the, electron, concentration, further, leads, to, body, centred, cubic, electron, concentration, 1, 5, complex, cubic, 1, 615, and, hexagonal, close, packed, phases, 1, 75, naturally, occurring, silver, is, composed, of, two, stable, isotopes, 107, ag, and, 109, ag, with, 107, ag, being, slightly, more, abundant, 51, 839, natural, abundance, this, almost, equal, abundance, is, rare, in, the, periodic, table, the, atomic, weight, is, 107, 8682, 2, u, this, value, is, very, important, because, of, the, importance, of, silver, compounds, particularly, halides, in, gravimetric, analysis, both, isotopes, of, silver, are, produced, in, stars, via, the, s, process, slow, neutron, capture, as, well, as, in, supernovas, via, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, twenty, eight, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, the, most, stable, being, 105, ag, with, a, half, life, of, 41, 29, days, 111, ag, with, a, half, life, of, 7, 45, days, and, 112, ag, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 13, hours, silver, has, numerous, nuclear, isomers, the, most, stable, being, 108m, ag, t, 1, 2, 418, years, 110m, ag, t, 1, 2, 249, 79, days, and, 106m, ag, t, 1, 2, 8, 28, days, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, an, hour, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, of, less, than, three, minutes, isotopes, of, silver, range, in, relative, atomic, mass, from, 92, 950, u, 93, ag, to, 129, 950, u, 130, ag, the, primary, decay, mode, before, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 107, ag, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, decay, the, primary, decay, products, before, 107, ag, are, palladium, element, 46, isotopes, and, the, primary, products, after, are, cadmium, element, 48, isotopes, the, palladium, isotope, 107, pd, decays, by, beta, emission, to, 107, ag, with, a, half, life, of, 6, 5, million, years, iron, meteorites, are, the, only, objects, with, a, high, enough, palladium, to, silver, ratio, to, yield, measurable, variations, in, 107, ag, abundance, radiogenic, 107, ag, was, first, discovered, in, the, santa, clara, meteorite, in, 1978, 107, pd, 107, ag, correlations, observed, in, bodies, that, have, clearly, been, melted, since, the, accretion, of, the, solar, system, must, reflect, the, presence, of, unstable, nuclides, in, the, early, solar, system, silver, is, a, rather, unreactive, metal, this, is, because, its, filled, 4d, shell, is, not, very, effective, in, shielding, the, electrostatic, forces, of, attraction, from, the, nucleus, to, the, outermost, 5s, electron, and, hence, silver, is, near, the, bottom, of, the, electrochemical, series, e, 0, ag, ag, 0, 799, v, in, group, 11, silver, has, the, lowest, first, ionization, energy, showing, the, instability, of, the, 5s, orbital, but, has, higher, second, and, third, ionization, energies, than, copper, and, gold, showing, the, stability, of, the, 4d, orbitals, so, that, the, chemistry, of, silver, is, predominantly, that, of, the, 1, oxidation, state, reflecting, the, increasingly, limited, range, of, oxidation, states, along, the, transition, series, as, the, d, orbitals, fill, and, stabilize, unlike, copper, for, which, the, larger, hydration, energy, of, cu, 2, as, compared, to, cu, is, the, reason, why, the, former, is, the, more, stable, in, aqueous, solution, and, solids, despite, lacking, the, stable, filled, d, subshell, of, the, latter, with, silver, this, effect, is, swamped, by, its, larger, second, ionisation, energy, hence, ag, is, the, stable, species, in, aqueous, solution, and, solids, with, ag, 2, being, much, less, stable, as, it, oxidizes, water, most, silver, compounds, have, significant, covalent, character, due, to, the, small, size, and, high, first, ionization, energy, 730, 8, kj, mol, of, silver, furthermore, silver, s, pauling, electronegativity, of, 1, 93, is, higher, than, that, of, lead, 1, 87, and, its, electron, affinity, of, 125, 6, kj, mol, is, much, higher, than, that, of, hydrogen, 72, 8, kj, mol, and, not, much, less, than, that, of, oxygen, 141, 0, kj, mol, due, to, its, full, d, subshell, silver, in, its, main, 1, oxidation, state, exhibits, relatively, few, properties, of, the, transition, metals, proper, from, groups, 4, to, 10, forming, rather, unstable, organometallic, compounds, forming, linear, complexes, showing, very, low, coordination, numbers, like, 2, and, forming, an, amphoteric, oxide, as, well, as, zintl, phases, like, the, post, transition, metals, unlike, the, preceding, transition, metals, the, 1, oxidation, state, of, silver, is, stable, even, in, the, absence, of, acceptor, ligands, silver, does, not, react, with, air, even, at, red, heat, and, thus, was, considered, by, alchemists, as, a, noble, metal, along, with, gold, its, reactivity, is, intermediate, between, that, of, copper, which, forms, copper, i, oxide, when, heated, in, air, to, red, heat, and, gold, like, copper, silver, reacts, with, sulfur, and, its, compounds, in, their, presence, silver, tarnishes, in, air, to, form, the, black, silver, sulfide, copper, forms, the, green, sulfate, instead, while, gold, does, not, react, while, silver, is, not, attacked, by, non, oxidizing, acids, the, metal, dissolves, readily, in, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, as, well, as, dilute, or, concentrated, nitric, acid, in, the, presence, of, air, and, especially, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, peroxide, silver, dissolves, readily, in, aqueous, solutions, of, cyanide, the, three, main, forms, of, deterioration, in, historical, silver, artifacts, are, tarnishing, formation, of, silver, chloride, due, to, long, term, immersion, in, salt, water, as, well, as, reaction, with, nitrate, ions, or, oxygen, fresh, silver, chloride, is, pale, yellow, becoming, purplish, on, exposure, to, light, it, projects, slightly, from, the, surface, of, the, artifact, or, coin, the, precipitation, of, copper, in, ancient, silver, can, be, used, to, date, artifacts, as, copper, is, nearly, always, a, constituent, of, silver, alloys, silver, metal, is, attacked, by, strong, oxidizers, such, as, potassium, permanganate, kmno, 4, and, potassium, dichromate, k, 2, cr, 2, o, 7, and, in, the, presence, of, potassium, bromide, kbr, these, compounds, are, used, in, photography, to, bleach, silver, images, converting, them, to, silver, bromide, that, can, either, be, fixed, with, thiosulfate, or, redeveloped, to, intensify, the, original, image, silver, forms, cyanide, complexes, silver, cyanide, that, are, soluble, in, water, in, the, presence, of, an, excess, of, cyanide, ions, silver, cyanide, solutions, are, used, in, electroplating, of, silver, the, common, oxidation, states, of, silver, are, in, order, of, commonness, 1, the, most, stable, state, for, example, silver, nitrate, agno, 3, 2, highly, oxidising, for, example, silver, ii, fluoride, agf, 2, and, even, very, rarely, 3, extreme, oxidising, for, example, potassium, tetrafluoroargentate, iii, kagf, 4, the, 3, state, requires, very, strong, oxidising, agents, to, attain, such, as, fluorine, or, peroxodisulfate, and, some, silver, iii, compounds, react, with, atmospheric, moisture, and, attack, glass, indeed, silver, iii, fluoride, is, usually, obtained, by, reacting, silver, or, silver, monofluoride, with, the, strongest, known, oxidizing, agent, krypton, difluoride, silver, and, gold, have, rather, low, chemical, affinities, for, oxygen, lower, than, copper, and, it, is, therefore, expected, that, silver, oxides, are, thermally, quite, unstable, soluble, silver, i, salts, precipitate, dark, brown, silver, i, oxide, ag, 2, o, upon, the, addition, of, alkali, the, hydroxide, agoh, exists, only, in, solution, otherwise, it, spontaneously, decomposes, to, the, oxide, silver, i, oxide, is, very, easily, reduced, to, metallic, silver, and, decomposes, to, silver, and, oxygen, above, 160, c, this, and, other, silver, i, compounds, may, be, oxidized, by, the, strong, oxidizing, agent, peroxodisulfate, to, black, ago, a, mixed, silver, i, iii, oxide, of, formula, ag, i, ag, iii, o, 2, some, other, mixed, oxides, with, silver, in, non, integral, oxidation, states, namely, ag, 2, o, 3, and, ag, 3, o, 4, are, also, known, as, is, ag, 3, o, which, behaves, as, a, metallic, conductor, silver, i, sulfide, ag, 2, s, is, very, readily, formed, from, its, constituent, elements, and, is, the, cause, of, the, black, tarnish, on, some, old, silver, objects, it, may, also, be, formed, from, the, reaction, of, hydrogen, sulfide, with, silver, metal, or, aqueous, ag, ions, many, non, stoichiometric, selenides, and, tellurides, are, known, in, particular, agte, 3, is, a, low, temperature, superconductor, the, only, known, dihalide, of, silver, is, the, difluoride, agf, 2, which, can, be, obtained, from, the, elements, under, heat, a, strong, yet, thermally, stable, and, therefore, safe, fluorinating, agent, silver, ii, fluoride, is, often, used, to, synthesize, hydrofluorocarbons, in, stark, contrast, to, this, all, four, silver, i, halides, are, known, the, fluoride, chloride, and, bromide, have, the, sodium, chloride, structure, but, the, iodide, has, three, known, stable, forms, at, different, temperatures, that, at, room, temperature, is, the, cubic, zinc, blende, structure, they, can, all, be, obtained, by, the, direct, reaction, of, their, respective, elements, as, the, halogen, group, is, descended, the, silver, halide, gains, more, and, more, covalent, character, solubility, decreases, and, the, colour, changes, from, the, white, chloride, to, the, yellow, iodide, as, the, energy, required, for, ligand, metal, charge, transfer, x, ag, xag, decreases, the, fluoride, is, anomalous, as, the, fluoride, ion, is, so, small, that, it, has, a, considerable, solvation, energy, and, hence, is, highly, water, soluble, and, forms, di, and, tetrahydrates, the, other, three, silver, halides, are, highly, insoluble, in, aqueous, solutions, and, are, very, commonly, used, in, gravimetric, analytical, methods, all, four, are, photosensitive, though, the, monofluoride, is, so, only, to, ultraviolet, light, especially, the, bromide, and, iodide, which, photodecompose, to, silver, metal, and, thus, were, used, in, traditional, photography, the, reaction, involved, is, the, process, is, not, reversible, because, the, silver, atom, liberated, is, typically, found, at, a, crystal, defect, or, an, impurity, site, so, that, the, electron, s, energy, is, lowered, enough, that, it, is, trapped, white, silver, nitrate, agno, 3, is, a, versatile, precursor, to, many, other, silver, compounds, especially, the, halides, and, is, much, less, sensitive, to, light, it, was, once, called, lunar, caustic, because, silver, was, called, luna, by, the, ancient, alchemists, who, believed, that, silver, was, associated, with, the, moon, it, is, often, used, for, gravimetric, analysis, exploiting, the, insolubility, of, the, heavier, silver, halides, which, it, is, a, common, precursor, to, silver, nitrate, is, used, in, many, ways, in, organic, synthesis, e, g, for, deprotection, and, oxidations, ag, binds, alkenes, reversibly, and, silver, nitrate, has, been, used, to, separate, mixtures, of, alkenes, by, selective, absorption, the, resulting, adduct, can, be, decomposed, with, ammonia, to, release, the, free, alkene, yellow, silver, carbonate, ag, 2, co, 3, can, be, easily, prepared, by, reacting, aqueous, solutions, of, sodium, carbonate, with, a, deficiency, of, silver, nitrate, its, principal, use, is, for, the, production, of, silver, powder, for, use, in, microelectronics, it, is, reduced, with, formaldehyde, producing, silver, free, of, alkali, metals, silver, carbonate, is, also, used, as, a, reagent, in, organic, synthesis, such, as, the, koenigs, knorr, reaction, in, the, f, tizon, oxidation, silver, carbonate, on, celite, acts, as, an, oxidising, agent, to, form, lactones, from, diols, it, is, also, employed, to, convert, alkyl, bromides, into, alcohols, silver, fulminate, agcno, a, powerful, touch, sensitive, explosive, used, in, percussion, caps, is, made, by, reaction, of, silver, metal, with, nitric, acid, in, the, presence, of, ethanol, other, dangerously, explosive, silver, compounds, are, silver, azide, agn, 3, formed, by, reaction, of, silver, nitrate, with, sodium, azide, and, silver, acetylide, ag, 2, c, 2, formed, when, silver, reacts, with, acetylene, gas, in, ammonia, solution, in, its, most, characteristic, reaction, silver, azide, decomposes, explosively, releasing, nitrogen, gas, given, the, photosensitivity, of, silver, salts, this, behaviour, may, be, induced, by, shining, a, light, on, its, crystals, silver, complexes, tend, to, be, similar, to, those, of, its, lighter, homologue, copper, silver, iii, complexes, tend, to, be, rare, and, very, easily, reduced, to, the, more, stable, lower, oxidation, states, though, they, are, slightly, more, stable, than, those, of, copper, iii, for, instance, the, square, planar, periodate, 5, and, tellurate, 5, complexes, may, be, prepared, by, oxidising, silver, i, with, alkaline, peroxodisulfate, the, yellow, diamagnetic, is, much, less, stable, fuming, in, moist, air, and, reacting, with, glass, silver, ii, complexes, are, more, common, like, the, valence, isoelectronic, copper, ii, complexes, they, are, usually, square, planar, and, paramagnetic, which, is, increased, by, the, greater, field, splitting, for, 4d, electrons, than, for, 3d, electrons, aqueous, ag, 2, produced, by, oxidation, of, ag, by, ozone, is, a, very, strong, oxidising, agent, even, in, acidic, solutions, it, is, stabilized, in, phosphoric, acid, due, to, complex, formation, peroxodisulfate, oxidation, is, generally, necessary, to, give, the, more, stable, complexes, with, heterocyclic, amines, such, as, 2, and, 2, these, are, stable, provided, the, counterion, cannot, reduce, the, silver, back, to, the, 1, oxidation, state, 2, is, also, known, in, its, violet, barium, salt, as, are, some, silver, ii, complexes, with, n, or, o, donor, ligands, such, as, pyridine, carboxylates, by, far, the, most, important, oxidation, state, for, silver, in, complexes, is, 1, the, ag, cation, is, diamagnetic, like, its, homologues, cu, and, au, as, all, three, have, closed, shell, electron, configurations, with, no, unpaired, electrons, its, complexes, are, colourless, provided, the, ligands, are, not, too, easily, polarized, such, as, i, ag, forms, salts, with, most, anions, but, it, is, reluctant, to, coordinate, to, oxygen, and, thus, most, of, these, salts, are, insoluble, in, water, the, exceptions, are, the, nitrate, perchlorate, and, fluoride, the, tetracoordinate, tetrahedral, aqueous, ion, is, known, but, the, characteristic, geometry, for, the, ag, cation, is, 2, coordinate, linear, for, example, silver, chloride, dissolves, readily, in, excess, aqueous, ammonia, to, form, silver, salts, are, dissolved, in, photography, due, to, the, formation, of, the, thiosulfate, complex, 3, and, cyanide, extraction, for, silver, and, gold, works, by, the, formation, of, the, complex, silver, cyanide, forms, the, linear, polymer, ag, c, n, ag, c, n, silver, thiocyanate, has, a, similar, structure, but, forms, a, zigzag, instead, because, of, the, sp, 3, hybridized, sulfur, atom, chelating, ligands, are, unable, to, form, linear, complexes, and, thus, silver, i, complexes, with, them, tend, to, form, polymers, a, few, exceptions, exist, such, as, the, near, tetrahedral, diphosphine, and, diarsine, complexes, under, standard, conditions, silver, does, not, form, simple, carbonyls, due, to, the, weakness, of, the, ag, c, bond, a, few, are, known, at, very, low, temperatures, around, 6, 15, k, such, as, the, green, planar, paramagnetic, ag, co, 3, which, dimerizes, at, 25, 30, k, probably, by, forming, ag, ag, bonds, additionally, the, silver, carbonyl, is, known, polymeric, aglx, complexes, with, alkenes, and, alkynes, are, known, but, their, bonds, are, thermodynamically, weaker, than, even, those, of, the, platinum, complexes, though, they, are, formed, more, readily, than, those, of, the, analogous, gold, complexes, they, are, also, quite, unsymmetrical, showing, the, weak, bonding, in, group, 11, ag, c, bonds, may, also, be, formed, by, silver, i, like, copper, i, and, gold, i, but, the, simple, alkyls, and, aryls, of, silver, i, are, even, less, stable, than, those, of, copper, i, which, tend, to, explode, under, ambient, conditions, for, example, poor, thermal, stability, is, reflected, in, the, relative, decomposition, temperatures, of, agme, 50, c, and, cume, 15, c, as, well, as, those, of, phag, 74, c, and, phcu, 100, c, the, c, ag, bond, is, stabilized, by, perfluoroalkyl, ligands, for, example, in, agcf, cf, 3, 2, alkenylsilver, compounds, are, also, more, stable, than, their, alkylsilver, counterparts, silver, nhc, complexes, are, easily, prepared, and, are, commonly, used, to, prepare, other, nhc, complexes, by, displacing, labile, ligands, for, example, the, reaction, of, the, bis, nhc, silver, i, complex, with, bis, acetonitrile, palladium, dichloride, or, chlorido, dimethyl, sulfide, gold, i, silver, forms, alloys, with, most, other, elements, on, the, periodic, table, the, elements, from, groups, 1, 3, except, for, hydrogen, lithium, and, beryllium, are, very, miscible, with, silver, in, the, condensed, phase, and, form, intermetallic, compounds, those, from, groups, 4, 9, are, only, poorly, miscible, the, elements, in, groups, 10, 14, except, boron, and, carbon, have, very, complex, ag, m, phase, diagrams, and, form, the, most, commercially, important, alloys, and, the, remaining, elements, on, the, periodic, table, have, no, consistency, in, their, ag, m, phase, diagrams, by, far, the, most, important, such, alloys, are, those, with, copper, most, silver, used, for, coinage, and, jewellery, is, in, reality, a, silver, copper, alloy, and, the, eutectic, mixture, is, used, in, vacuum, brazing, the, two, metals, are, completely, miscible, as, liquids, but, not, as, solids, their, importance, in, industry, comes, from, the, fact, that, their, properties, tend, to, be, suitable, over, a, wide, range, of, variation, in, silver, and, copper, concentration, although, most, useful, alloys, tend, to, be, richer, in, silver, than, the, eutectic, mixture, 71, 9, silver, and, 28, 1, copper, by, weight, and, 60, 1, silver, and, 28, 1, copper, by, atom, most, other, binary, alloys, are, of, little, use, for, example, silver, gold, alloys, are, too, soft, and, silver, cadmium, alloys, too, toxic, ternary, alloys, have, much, greater, importance, dental, amalgams, are, usually, silver, tin, mercury, alloys, silver, copper, gold, alloys, are, very, important, in, jewellery, usually, on, the, gold, rich, side, and, have, a, vast, range, of, hardnesses, and, colours, silver, copper, zinc, alloys, are, useful, as, low, melting, brazing, alloys, and, silver, cadmium, indium, involving, three, adjacent, elements, on, the, periodic, table, is, useful, in, nuclear, reactors, because, of, its, high, thermal, neutron, capture, cross, section, good, conduction, of, heat, mechanical, stability, and, resistance, to, corrosion, in, hot, water, the, word, silver, appears, in, old, english, in, various, spellings, such, as, seolfor, and, siolfor, it, is, cognate, with, old, high, german, silabar, gothic, silubr, or, old, norse, silfr, all, ultimately, deriving, from, proto, germanic, silubra, the, balto, slavic, words, for, silver, are, rather, similar, to, the, germanic, ones, e, g, russian, polish, srebro, lithuanian, sid, bras, as, is, the, celtiberian, form, silabur, they, may, have, a, common, indo, european, origin, although, their, morphology, rather, suggest, a, non, indo, european, wanderwort, some, scholars, have, thus, proposed, a, paleo, hispanic, origin, pointing, to, the, basque, form, zilharr, as, an, evidence, the, chemical, symbol, ag, is, from, the, latin, word, for, silver, argentum, compare, ancient, greek, rgyros, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, h, er, formerly, reconstructed, as, ar, meaning, white, or, shining, this, was, the, usual, proto, indo, european, word, for, the, metal, whose, reflexes, are, missing, in, germanic, and, balto, slavic, silver, was, known, in, prehistoric, times, the, three, metals, of, group, 11, copper, silver, and, gold, occur, in, the, elemental, form, in, nature, and, were, probably, used, as, the, first, primitive, forms, of, money, as, opposed, to, simple, bartering, however, unlike, copper, silver, did, not, lead, to, the, growth, of, metallurgy, on, account, of, its, low, structural, strength, and, was, more, often, used, ornamentally, or, as, money, since, silver, is, more, reactive, than, gold, supplies, of, native, silver, were, much, more, limited, than, those, of, gold, for, example, silver, was, more, expensive, than, gold, in, egypt, until, around, the, fifteenth, century, bc, the, egyptians, are, thought, to, have, separated, gold, from, silver, by, heating, the, metals, with, salt, and, then, reducing, the, silver, chloride, produced, to, the, metal, the, situation, changed, with, the, discovery, of, cupellation, a, technique, that, allowed, silver, metal, to, be, extracted, from, its, ores, while, slag, heaps, found, in, asia, minor, and, on, the, islands, of, the, aegean, sea, indicate, that, silver, was, being, separated, from, lead, as, early, as, the, 4th, millennium, bc, and, one, of, the, earliest, silver, extraction, centres, in, europe, was, sardinia, in, the, early, chalcolithic, period, these, techniques, did, not, spread, widely, until, later, when, it, spread, throughout, the, region, and, beyond, the, origins, of, silver, production, in, india, china, and, japan, were, almost, certainly, equally, ancient, but, are, not, well, documented, due, to, their, great, age, when, the, phoenicians, first, came, to, what, is, now, spain, they, obtained, so, much, silver, that, they, could, not, fit, it, all, on, their, ships, and, as, a, result, used, silver, to, weight, their, anchors, instead, of, lead, by, the, time, of, the, greek, and, roman, civilizations, silver, coins, were, a, staple, of, the, economy, the, greeks, were, already, extracting, silver, from, galena, by, the, 7th, century, bc, and, the, rise, of, athens, was, partly, made, possible, by, the, nearby, silver, mines, at, laurium, from, which, they, extracted, about, 30, tonnes, a, year, from, 600, to, 300, bc, the, stability, of, the, roman, currency, relied, to, a, high, degree, on, the, supply, of, silver, bullion, mostly, from, spain, which, roman, miners, produced, on, a, scale, unparalleled, before, the, discovery, of, the, new, world, reaching, a, peak, production, of, 200, tonnes, per, year, an, estimated, silver, stock, of, 10, 000, tonnes, circulated, in, the, roman, economy, in, the, middle, of, the, second, century, ad, five, to, ten, times, larger, than, the, combined, amount, of, silver, available, to, medieval, europe, and, the, abbasid, caliphate, around, ad, 800, the, romans, also, recorded, the, extraction, of, silver, in, central, and, northern, europe, in, the, same, time, period, this, production, came, to, a, nearly, complete, halt, with, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, not, to, resume, until, the, time, of, charlemagne, by, then, tens, of, thousands, of, tonnes, of, silver, had, already, been, extracted, central, europe, became, the, centre, of, silver, production, during, the, middle, ages, as, the, mediterranean, deposits, exploited, by, the, ancient, civilisations, had, been, exhausted, silver, mines, were, opened, in, bohemia, saxony, alsace, the, lahn, region, siegerland, silesia, hungary, norway, steiermark, schwaz, and, the, southern, black, forest, most, of, these, ores, were, quite, rich, in, silver, and, could, simply, be, separated, by, hand, from, the, remaining, rock, and, then, smelted, some, deposits, of, native, silver, were, also, encountered, many, of, these, mines, were, soon, exhausted, but, a, few, of, them, remained, active, until, the, industrial, revolution, before, which, the, world, production, of, silver, was, around, a, meagre, 50, tonnes, per, year, in, the, americas, high, temperature, silver, lead, cupellation, technology, was, developed, by, pre, inca, civilizations, as, early, as, ad, 60, 120, silver, deposits, in, india, china, japan, and, pre, columbian, america, continued, to, be, mined, during, this, time, with, the, discovery, of, america, and, the, plundering, of, silver, by, the, spanish, conquistadors, central, and, south, america, became, the, dominant, producers, of, silver, until, around, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, particularly, peru, bolivia, chile, and, argentina, the, last, of, these, countries, later, took, its, name, from, that, of, the, metal, that, composed, so, much, of, its, mineral, wealth, the, silver, trade, gave, way, to, a, global, network, of, exchange, as, one, historian, put, it, silver, went, round, the, world, and, made, the, world, go, round, much, of, this, silver, ended, up, in, the, hands, of, the, chinese, a, portuguese, merchant, in, 1621, noted, that, silver, wanders, throughout, all, the, world, before, flocking, to, china, where, it, remains, as, if, at, its, natural, center, still, much, of, it, went, to, spain, allowing, spanish, rulers, to, pursue, military, and, political, ambitions, in, both, europe, and, the, americas, new, world, mines, concluded, several, historians, supported, the, spanish, empire, in, the, 19th, century, primary, production, of, silver, moved, to, north, america, particularly, canada, mexico, and, nevada, in, the, united, states, some, secondary, production, from, lead, and, zinc, ores, also, took, place, in, europe, and, deposits, in, siberia, and, the, russian, far, east, as, well, as, in, australia, were, mined, poland, emerged, as, an, important, producer, during, the, 1970s, after, the, discovery, of, copper, deposits, that, were, rich, in, silver, before, the, centre, of, production, returned, to, the, americas, the, following, decade, today, peru, and, mexico, are, still, among, the, primary, silver, producers, but, the, distribution, of, silver, production, around, the, world, is, quite, balanced, and, about, one, fifth, of, the, silver, supply, comes, from, recycling, instead, of, new, production, silver, plays, a, certain, role, in, mythology, and, has, found, various, usage, as, a, metaphor, and, in, folklore, the, greek, poet, hesiod, s, works, and, days, lines, 109, 201, lists, different, ages, of, man, named, after, metals, like, gold, silver, bronze, and, iron, to, account, for, successive, ages, of, humanity, ovid, s, metamorphoses, contains, another, retelling, of, the, story, containing, an, illustration, of, silver, s, metaphorical, use, of, signifying, the, second, best, in, a, series, better, than, bronze, but, worse, than, gold, but, when, good, saturn, banish, d, from, above, was, driv, n, to, hell, the, world, was, under, jove, succeeding, times, a, silver, age, behold, excelling, brass, but, more, excell, d, by, gold, in, folklore, silver, was, commonly, thought, to, have, mystic, powers, for, example, a, bullet, cast, from, silver, is, often, supposed, in, such, folklore, the, only, weapon, that, is, effective, against, a, werewolf, witch, or, other, monsters, from, this, the, idiom, of, a, silver, bullet, developed, into, figuratively, referring, to, any, simple, solution, with, very, high, effectiveness, or, almost, miraculous, results, as, in, the, widely, discussed, software, engineering, paper, no, silver, bullet, other, powers, attributed, to, silver, include, detection, of, poison, and, facilitation, of, passage, into, the, mythical, realm, of, fairies, silver, production, has, also, inspired, figurative, language, clear, references, to, cupellation, occur, throughout, the, old, testament, of, the, bible, such, as, in, jeremiah, s, rebuke, to, judah, the, bellows, are, burned, the, lead, is, consumed, of, the, fire, the, founder, melteth, in, vain, for, the, wicked, are, not, plucked, away, reprobate, silver, shall, men, call, them, because, the, lord, hath, rejected, them, jeremiah, 6, 19, 20, jeremiah, was, also, aware, of, sheet, silver, exemplifying, the, malleability, and, ductility, of, the, metal, silver, spread, into, plates, is, brought, from, tarshish, and, gold, from, uphaz, the, work, of, the, workman, and, of, the, hands, of, the, founder, blue, and, purple, is, their, clothing, they, are, all, the, work, of, cunning, men, jeremiah, 10, 9, silver, also, has, more, negative, cultural, meanings, the, idiom, thirty, pieces, of, silver, referring, to, a, reward, for, betrayal, references, the, bribe, judas, iscariot, is, said, in, the, new, testament, to, have, taken, from, jewish, leaders, in, jerusalem, to, turn, jesus, of, nazareth, over, to, soldiers, of, the, high, priest, caiaphas, ethically, silver, also, symbolizes, greed, and, degradation, of, consciousness, this, is, the, negative, aspect, the, perverting, of, its, value, the, abundance, of, silver, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, 0, 08, parts, per, million, almost, exactly, the, same, as, that, of, mercury, it, mostly, occurs, in, sulfide, ores, especially, acanthite, and, argentite, ag, 2, s, argentite, deposits, sometimes, also, contain, native, silver, when, they, occur, in, reducing, environments, and, when, in, contact, with, salt, water, they, are, converted, to, chlorargyrite, including, horn, silver, agcl, which, is, prevalent, in, chile, and, new, south, wales, most, other, silver, minerals, are, silver, pnictides, or, chalcogenides, they, are, generally, lustrous, semiconductors, most, true, silver, deposits, as, opposed, to, argentiferous, deposits, of, other, metals, came, from, tertiary, period, vulcanism, the, principal, sources, of, silver, are, the, ores, of, copper, copper, nickel, lead, and, lead, zinc, obtained, from, peru, bolivia, mexico, china, australia, chile, poland, and, serbia, peru, bolivia, and, mexico, have, been, mining, silver, since, 1546, and, are, still, major, world, producers, top, silver, producing, mines, are, cannington, australia, fresnillo, mexico, san, crist, bal, bolivia, antamina, peru, rudna, poland, and, penasquito, mexico, top, near, term, mine, development, projects, through, 2015, are, pascua, lama, chile, navidad, argentina, jaunicipio, mexico, malku, khota, bolivia, and, hackett, river, canada, in, central, asia, tajikistan, is, known, to, have, some, of, the, largest, silver, deposits, in, the, world, silver, is, usually, found, in, nature, combined, with, other, metals, or, in, minerals, that, contain, silver, compounds, generally, in, the, form, of, sulfides, such, as, galena, lead, sulfide, or, cerussite, lead, carbonate, so, the, primary, production, of, silver, requires, the, smelting, and, then, cupellation, of, argentiferous, lead, ores, a, historically, important, process, lead, melts, at, 327, c, lead, oxide, at, 888, c, and, silver, melts, at, 960, c, to, separate, the, silver, the, alloy, is, melted, again, at, the, high, temperature, of, 960, c, to, 1000, c, in, an, oxidizing, environment, the, lead, oxidises, to, lead, monoxide, then, known, as, litharge, which, captures, the, oxygen, from, the, other, metals, present, the, liquid, lead, oxide, is, removed, or, absorbed, by, capillary, action, into, the, hearth, linings, today, silver, metal, is, primarily, produced, instead, as, a, secondary, byproduct, of, electrolytic, refining, of, copper, lead, and, zinc, and, by, application, of, the, parkes, process, on, lead, bullion, from, ore, that, also, contains, silver, in, such, processes, silver, follows, the, non, ferrous, metal, in, question, through, its, concentration, and, smelting, and, is, later, purified, out, for, example, in, copper, production, purified, copper, is, electrolytically, deposited, on, the, cathode, while, the, less, reactive, precious, metals, such, as, silver, and, gold, collect, under, the, anode, as, the, so, called, anode, slime, this, is, then, separated, and, purified, of, base, metals, by, treatment, with, hot, aerated, dilute, sulfuric, acid, and, heating, with, lime, or, silica, flux, before, the, silver, is, purified, to, over, 99, 9, purity, via, electrolysis, in, nitrate, solution, commercial, grade, fine, silver, is, at, least, 99, 9, pure, and, purities, greater, than, 99, 999, are, available, in, 2022, mexico, was, the, top, producer, of, silver, 6, 300, tonnes, or, 24, 2, of, the, world, s, total, of, 26, 000, t, followed, by, china, 3, 600, t, and, peru, 3, 100, t, silver, concentration, is, low, in, seawater, pmol, l, levels, vary, by, depth, and, between, water, bodies, dissolved, silver, concentrations, range, from, 0, 3, pmol, l, in, coastal, surface, waters, to, 22, 8, pmol, l, in, pelagic, deep, waters, analyzing, the, presence, and, dynamics, of, silver, in, marine, environments, is, difficult, due, to, these, particularly, low, concentrations, and, complex, interactions, in, the, environment, although, a, rare, trace, metal, concentrations, are, greatly, impacted, by, fluvial, aeolian, atmospheric, and, upwelling, inputs, as, well, as, anthropogenic, inputs, via, discharge, waste, disposal, and, emissions, from, industrial, companies, other, internal, processes, such, as, decomposition, of, organic, matter, may, be, a, source, of, dissolved, silver, in, deeper, waters, which, feeds, into, some, surface, waters, through, upwelling, and, vertical, mixing, in, the, atlantic, and, pacific, silver, concentrations, are, minimal, at, the, surface, but, rise, in, deeper, waters, silver, is, taken, up, by, plankton, in, the, photic, zone, remobilized, with, depth, and, enriched, in, deep, waters, silver, is, transported, from, the, atlantic, to, the, other, oceanic, water, masses, in, north, pacific, waters, silver, is, remobilized, at, a, slower, rate, and, increasingly, enriched, compared, to, deep, atlantic, waters, silver, has, increasing, concentrations, that, follow, the, major, oceanic, conveyor, belt, that, cycles, water, and, nutrients, from, the, north, atlantic, to, the, south, atlantic, to, the, north, pacific, there, is, not, an, extensive, amount, of, data, focused, on, how, marine, life, is, affected, by, silver, despite, the, likely, deleterious, effects, it, could, have, on, organisms, through, bioaccumulation, association, with, particulate, matters, and, sorption, not, until, about, 1984, did, scientists, begin, to, understand, the, chemical, characteristics, of, silver, and, the, potential, toxicity, in, fact, mercury, is, the, only, other, trace, metal, that, surpasses, the, toxic, effects, of, silver, however, the, full, extent, of, silver, toxicity, is, not, expected, in, oceanic, conditions, because, of, its, ability, to, transfer, into, nonreactive, biological, compounds, in, one, study, the, presence, of, excess, ionic, silver, and, silver, nanoparticles, caused, bioaccumulation, effects, on, zebrafish, organs, and, altered, the, chemical, pathways, within, their, gills, in, addition, very, early, experimental, studies, demonstrated, how, the, toxic, effects, of, silver, fluctuate, with, salinity, and, other, parameters, as, well, as, between, life, stages, and, different, species, such, as, finfish, molluscs, and, crustaceans, another, study, found, raised, concentrations, of, silver, in, the, muscles, and, liver, of, dolphins, and, whales, indicating, pollution, of, this, metal, within, recent, decades, silver, is, not, an, easy, metal, for, an, organism, to, eliminate, and, elevated, concentrations, can, cause, death, the, earliest, known, coins, were, minted, in, the, kingdom, of, lydia, in, asia, minor, around, 600, bc, the, coins, of, lydia, were, made, of, electrum, which, is, a, naturally, occurring, alloy, of, gold, and, silver, that, was, available, within, the, territory, of, lydia, since, that, time, silver, standards, in, which, the, standard, economic, unit, of, account, is, a, fixed, weight, of, silver, have, been, widespread, throughout, the, world, until, the, 20th, century, notable, silver, coins, through, the, centuries, include, the, greek, drachma, the, roman, denarius, the, islamic, dirham, the, karshapana, from, ancient, india, and, rupee, from, the, time, of, the, mughal, empire, grouped, with, copper, and, gold, coins, to, create, a, trimetallic, standard, and, the, spanish, dollar, the, ratio, between, the, amount, of, silver, used, for, coinage, and, that, used, for, other, purposes, has, fluctuated, greatly, over, time, for, example, in, wartime, more, silver, tends, to, have, been, used, for, coinage, to, finance, the, war, today, silver, bullion, has, the, iso, 4217, currency, code, xag, one, of, only, four, precious, metals, to, have, one, the, others, being, palladium, platinum, and, gold, silver, coins, are, produced, from, cast, rods, or, ingots, rolled, to, the, correct, thickness, heat, treated, and, then, used, to, cut, blanks, from, these, blanks, are, then, milled, and, minted, in, a, coining, press, modern, coining, presses, can, produce, 8000, silver, coins, per, hour, silver, prices, are, normally, quoted, in, troy, ounces, one, troy, ounce, is, equal, to, 31, 1034768, grams, the, london, silver, fix, is, published, every, working, day, at, noon, london, time, this, price, is, determined, by, several, major, international, banks, and, is, used, by, london, bullion, market, members, for, trading, that, day, prices, are, most, commonly, shown, as, the, united, states, dollar, usd, the, pound, sterling, gbp, and, the, euro, eur, the, major, use, of, silver, besides, coinage, throughout, most, of, history, was, in, the, manufacture, of, jewellery, and, other, general, use, items, and, this, continues, to, be, a, major, use, today, examples, include, table, silver, for, cutlery, for, which, silver, is, highly, suited, due, to, its, antibacterial, properties, western, concert, flutes, are, usually, plated, with, or, made, out, of, sterling, silver, in, fact, most, silverware, is, only, silver, plated, rather, than, made, out, of, pure, silver, the, silver, is, normally, put, in, place, by, electroplating, silver, plated, glass, as, opposed, to, metal, is, used, for, mirrors, vacuum, flasks, and, christmas, tree, decorations, because, pure, silver, is, very, soft, most, silver, used, for, these, purposes, is, alloyed, with, copper, with, finenesses, of, 925, 1000, 835, 1000, and, 800, 1000, being, common, one, drawback, is, the, easy, tarnishing, of, silver, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, sulfide, and, its, derivatives, including, precious, metals, such, as, palladium, platinum, and, gold, gives, resistance, to, tarnishing, but, is, quite, costly, base, metals, like, zinc, cadmium, silicon, and, germanium, do, not, totally, prevent, corrosion, and, tend, to, affect, the, lustre, and, colour, of, the, alloy, electrolytically, refined, pure, silver, plating, is, effective, at, increasing, resistance, to, tarnishing, the, usual, solutions, for, restoring, the, lustre, of, tarnished, silver, are, dipping, baths, that, reduce, the, silver, sulfide, surface, to, metallic, silver, and, cleaning, off, the, layer, of, tarnish, with, a, paste, the, latter, approach, also, has, the, welcome, side, effect, of, polishing, the, silver, concurrently, in, medicine, silver, is, incorporated, into, wound, dressings, and, used, as, an, antibiotic, coating, in, medical, devices, wound, dressings, containing, silver, sulfadiazine, or, silver, nanomaterials, are, used, to, treat, external, infections, silver, is, also, used, in, some, medical, applications, such, as, urinary, catheters, where, tentative, evidence, indicates, it, reduces, catheter, related, urinary, tract, infections, and, in, endotracheal, breathing, tubes, where, evidence, suggests, it, reduces, ventilator, associated, pneumonia, the, silver, ion, is, bioactive, and, in, sufficient, concentration, readily, kills, bacteria, in, vitro, silver, ions, interfere, with, enzymes, in, the, bacteria, that, transport, nutrients, form, structures, and, synthesise, cell, walls, these, ions, also, bond, with, the, bacteria, s, genetic, material, silver, and, silver, nanoparticles, are, used, as, an, antimicrobial, in, a, variety, of, industrial, healthcare, and, domestic, application, for, example, infusing, clothing, with, nanosilver, particles, thus, allows, them, to, stay, odourless, for, longer, bacteria, can, however, develop, resistance, to, the, antimicrobial, action, of, silver, silver, compounds, are, taken, up, by, the, body, like, mercury, compounds, but, lack, the, toxicity, of, the, latter, silver, and, its, alloys, are, used, in, cranial, surgery, to, replace, bone, and, silver, tin, mercury, amalgams, are, used, in, dentistry, silver, diammine, fluoride, the, fluoride, salt, of, a, coordination, complex, with, the, formula, f, is, a, topical, medicament, drug, used, to, treat, and, prevent, dental, caries, cavities, and, relieve, dentinal, hypersensitivity, silver, is, very, important, in, electronics, for, conductors, and, electrodes, on, account, of, its, high, electrical, conductivity, even, when, tarnished, bulk, silver, and, silver, foils, were, used, to, make, vacuum, tubes, and, continue, to, be, used, today, in, the, manufacture, of, semiconductor, devices, circuits, and, their, components, for, example, silver, is, used, in, high, quality, connectors, for, rf, vhf, and, higher, frequencies, particularly, in, tuned, circuits, such, as, cavity, filters, where, conductors, cannot, be, scaled, by, more, than, 6, printed, circuits, and, rfid, antennas, are, made, with, silver, paints, powdered, silver, and, its, alloys, are, used, in, paste, preparations, for, conductor, layers, and, electrodes, ceramic, capacitors, and, other, ceramic, components, silver, containing, brazing, alloys, are, used, for, brazing, metallic, materials, mostly, cobalt, nickel, and, copper, based, alloys, tool, steels, and, precious, metals, the, basic, components, are, silver, and, copper, with, other, elements, selected, according, to, the, specific, application, desired, examples, include, zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and, phosphorus, silver, provides, increased, workability, and, corrosion, resistance, during, usage, silver, is, useful, in, the, manufacture, of, chemical, equipment, on, account, of, its, low, chemical, reactivity, high, thermal, conductivity, and, being, easily, workable, silver, crucibles, alloyed, with, 0, 15, nickel, to, avoid, recrystallisation, of, the, metal, at, red, heat, are, used, for, carrying, out, alkaline, fusion, copper, and, silver, are, also, used, when, doing, chemistry, with, fluorine, equipment, made, to, work, at, high, temperatures, is, often, silver, plated, silver, and, its, alloys, with, gold, are, used, as, wire, or, ring, seals, for, oxygen, compressors, and, vacuum, equipment, silver, metal, is, a, good, catalyst, for, oxidation, reactions, in, fact, it, is, somewhat, too, good, for, most, purposes, as, finely, divided, silver, tends, to, result, in, complete, oxidation, of, organic, substances, to, carbon, dioxide, and, water, and, hence, coarser, grained, silver, tends, to, be, used, instead, for, instance, 15, silver, supported, on, al, 2, o, 3, or, silicates, is, a, catalyst, for, the, oxidation, of, ethylene, to, ethylene, oxide, at, 230, 270, c, dehydrogenation, of, methanol, to, formaldehyde, is, conducted, at, 600, 720, c, over, silver, gauze, or, crystals, as, the, catalyst, as, is, dehydrogenation, of, isopropanol, to, acetone, in, the, gas, phase, glycol, yields, glyoxal, and, ethanol, yields, acetaldehyde, while, organic, amines, are, dehydrated, to, nitriles, before, the, advent, of, digital, photography, which, is, now, dominant, the, photosensitivity, of, silver, halides, was, exploited, for, use, in, traditional, film, photography, the, photosensitive, emulsion, used, in, black, and, white, photography, is, a, suspension, of, silver, halide, crystals, in, gelatin, possibly, mixed, in, with, some, noble, metal, compounds, for, improved, photosensitivity, developing, and, tuning, colour, photography, requires, the, addition, of, special, dye, components, and, sensitisers, so, that, the, initial, black, and, white, silver, image, couples, with, a, different, dye, component, the, original, silver, images, are, bleached, off, and, the, silver, is, then, recovered, and, recycled, silver, nitrate, is, the, starting, material, in, all, cases, the, market, for, silver, nitrate, and, silver, halides, for, photography, has, rapidly, declined, with, the, rise, of, digital, cameras, from, the, peak, global, demand, for, photographic, silver, in, 1999, 267, 000, 000, troy, ounces, or, 8, 304, 6, tonnes, the, market, contracted, almost, 70, by, 2013, nanosilver, particles, between, 10, and, 100, nanometres, in, size, are, used, in, many, applications, they, are, used, in, conductive, inks, for, printed, electronics, and, have, a, much, lower, melting, point, than, larger, silver, particles, of, micrometre, size, they, are, also, used, medicinally, in, antibacterials, and, antifungals, in, much, the, same, way, as, larger, silver, particles, in, addition, according, to, the, european, union, observatory, for, nanomaterials, euon, silver, nanoparticles, are, used, both, in, pigments, as, well, as, cosmetics, pure, silver, metal, is, used, as, a, food, colouring, it, has, the, e174, designation, and, is, approved, in, the, european, union, traditional, indian, and, pakistani, dishes, sometimes, include, decorative, silver, foil, known, as, vark, and, in, various, other, cultures, silver, drag, e, are, used, to, decorate, cakes, cookies, and, other, dessert, items, photochromic, lenses, include, silver, halides, so, that, ultraviolet, light, in, natural, daylight, liberates, metallic, silver, darkening, the, lenses, the, silver, halides, are, reformed, in, lower, light, intensities, colourless, silver, chloride, films, are, used, in, radiation, detectors, zeolite, sieves, incorporating, ag, ions, are, used, to, desalinate, seawater, during, rescues, using, silver, ions, to, precipitate, chloride, as, silver, chloride, silver, is, also, used, for, its, antibacterial, properties, for, water, sanitisation, but, the, application, of, this, is, limited, by, limits, on, silver, consumption, colloidal, silver, is, similarly, used, to, disinfect, closed, swimming, pools, while, it, has, the, advantage, of, not, giving, off, a, smell, like, hypochlorite, treatments, do, colloidal, silver, is, not, effective, enough, for, more, contaminated, open, swimming, pools, small, silver, iodide, crystals, are, used, in, cloud, seeding, to, cause, rain, the, texas, legislature, designated, silver, the, official, precious, metal, of, texas, in, 2007, silver, compounds, have, low, toxicity, compared, to, those, of, most, other, heavy, metals, as, they, are, poorly, absorbed, by, the, human, body, when, ingested, and, that, which, does, get, absorbed, is, rapidly, converted, to, insoluble, silver, compounds, or, complexed, by, metallothionein, however, silver, fluoride, and, silver, nitrate, are, caustic, and, can, cause, tissue, damage, resulting, in, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling, blood, pressure, cramps, paralysis, and, respiratory, arrest, animals, repeatedly, dosed, with, silver, salts, have, been, observed, to, experience, anaemia, slowed, growth, necrosis, of, the, liver, and, fatty, degeneration, of, the, liver, and, kidneys, rats, implanted, with, silver, foil, or, injected, with, colloidal, silver, have, been, observed, to, develop, localised, tumours, parenterally, admistered, colloidal, silver, causes, acute, silver, poisoning, some, waterborne, species, are, particularly, sensitive, to, silver, salts, and, those, of, the, other, precious, metals, in, most, situations, however, silver, does, not, pose, serious, environmental, hazards, in, large, doses, silver, and, compounds, containing, it, can, be, absorbed, into, the, circulatory, system, and, become, deposited, in, various, body, tissues, leading, to, argyria, which, results, in, a, blue, grayish, pigmentation, of, the, skin, eyes, and, mucous, membranes, argyria, is, rare, and, so, far, as, is, known, does, not, otherwise, harm, a, person, s, health, though, it, is, disfiguring, and, usually, permanent, mild, forms, of, argyria, are, sometimes, mistaken, for, cyanosis, a, blue, tint, on, skin, caused, by, lack, of, oxygen, metallic, silver, like, copper, is, an, antibacterial, agent, which, was, known, to, the, ancients, and, first, scientifically, investigated, and, named, the, oligodynamic, effect, by, carl, n, geli, silver, ions, damage, the, metabolism, of, bacteria, even, at, such, low, concentrations, as, 0, 01, 0, 1, milligrams, per, litre, metallic, silver, has, a, similar, effect, due, to, the, formation, of, silver, oxide, this, effect, is, lost, in, the, presence, of, sulfur, due, to, the, extreme, insolubility, of, silver, sulfide, some, silver, compounds, are, very, explosive, such, as, the, nitrogen, compounds, silver, azide, silver, amide, and, silver, fulminate, as, well, as, silver, acetylide, silver, oxalate, and, silver, ii, oxide, they, can, explode, on, heating, force, drying, illumination, or, sometimes, spontaneously, to, avoid, the, formation, of, such, compounds, ammonia, and, acetylene, should, be, kept, away, from, silver, equipment, salts, of, silver, with, strongly, oxidising, acids, such, as, silver, chlorate, and, silver, nitrate, can, explode, on, contact, with, materials, that, can, be, readily, oxidised, such, as, organic, compounds, sulfur, and, soot
