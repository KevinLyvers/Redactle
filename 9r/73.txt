the, mole, symbol, mol, is, a, unit, of, measurement, the, base, unit, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, for, amount, of, substance, a, quantity, proportional, to, the, number, of, elementary, entities, of, a, substance, one, mole, contains, exactly, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, elementary, entities, approximately, 602, sextillion, or, 602, billion, times, a, trillion, which, can, be, atoms, molecules, ions, ion, pairs, or, other, particles, the, number, of, particles, in, a, mole, is, the, avogadro, number, symbol, n, 0, and, the, numerical, value, of, the, avogadro, constant, symbol, n, a, expressed, in, mol, 1, the, value, was, chosen, on, the, basis, of, the, historical, definition, of, the, mole, as, the, amount, of, substance, that, corresponds, to, the, number, of, atoms, in, 12, grams, of, 12, c, which, made, the, mass, of, a, mole, of, a, compound, expressed, in, grams, numerically, equal, to, the, average, molecular, mass, or, formula, mass, of, the, compound, expressed, in, daltons, with, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, the, numerical, equivalence, is, now, only, approximate, but, may, be, assumed, for, all, practical, purposes, the, mole, is, widely, used, in, chemistry, as, a, convenient, way, to, express, amounts, of, reactants, and, amounts, of, products, of, chemical, reactions, for, example, the, chemical, equation, 2, h, 2, o, 2, 2, h, 2, o, can, be, interpreted, to, mean, that, for, each, 2, mol, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, and, 1, mol, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, that, react, 2, mol, of, water, h, 2, o, form, the, concentration, of, a, solution, is, commonly, expressed, by, its, molar, concentration, defined, as, the, amount, of, dissolved, substance, per, unit, volume, of, solution, for, which, the, unit, typically, used, is, mole, per, litre, mol, l, the, number, of, entities, symbol, n, in, a, one, mole, sample, equals, the, avogadro, number, symbol, n, 0, a, dimensionless, quantity, historically, n, 0, approximates, the, number, of, nucleons, protons, or, neutrons, in, one, gram, of, ordinary, matter, the, avogadro, constant, symbol, n, a, n, 0, mol, has, numerical, multiplier, given, by, the, avogadro, number, with, the, unit, reciprocal, mole, mol, 1, the, ratio, n, n, n, a, is, a, measure, of, the, amount, of, substance, with, the, unit, mole, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, substance, an, elementary, entity, may, be, an, atom, a, molecule, an, ion, an, ion, pair, or, a, subatomic, particle, such, as, a, proton, for, example, 10, moles, of, water, a, chemical, compound, and, 10, moles, of, mercury, a, chemical, element, contain, equal, numbers, of, substance, with, one, atom, of, mercury, for, each, molecule, of, water, despite, the, two, quantities, having, different, volumes, and, different, masses, the, mole, corresponds, to, a, given, count, of, entities, usually, the, entities, counted, are, chemically, identical, and, individually, distinct, for, example, a, solution, may, contain, a, certain, number, of, dissolved, molecules, that, are, more, or, less, independent, of, each, other, however, the, constituent, entities, in, a, solid, are, fixed, and, bound, in, a, lattice, arrangement, yet, they, may, be, separable, without, losing, their, chemical, identity, thus, the, solid, is, composed, of, a, certain, number, of, moles, of, such, entities, in, yet, other, cases, such, as, diamond, where, the, entire, crystal, is, essentially, a, single, molecule, the, mole, is, still, used, to, express, the, number, of, atoms, bound, together, rather, than, a, count, of, molecules, thus, common, chemical, conventions, apply, to, the, definition, of, the, constituent, entities, of, a, substance, in, other, cases, exact, definitions, may, be, specified, the, mass, of, a, substance, is, equal, to, its, relative, atomic, or, molecular, mass, multiplied, by, the, molar, mass, constant, which, is, almost, exactly, 1, g, mol, the, history, of, the, mole, is, intertwined, with, that, of, units, of, molecular, mass, and, the, avogadro, constant, the, first, table, of, standard, atomic, weight, was, published, by, john, dalton, 1766, 1844, in, 1805, based, on, a, system, in, which, the, relative, atomic, mass, of, hydrogen, was, defined, as, 1, these, relative, atomic, masses, were, based, on, the, stoichiometric, proportions, of, chemical, reaction, and, compounds, a, fact, that, greatly, aided, their, acceptance, it, was, not, necessary, for, a, chemist, to, subscribe, to, atomic, theory, an, unproven, hypothesis, at, the, time, to, make, practical, use, of, the, tables, this, would, lead, to, some, confusion, between, atomic, masses, promoted, by, proponents, of, atomic, theory, and, equivalent, weights, promoted, by, its, opponents, and, which, sometimes, differed, from, relative, atomic, masses, by, an, integer, factor, which, would, last, throughout, much, of, the, nineteenth, century, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, 1779, 1848, was, instrumental, in, the, determination, of, relative, atomic, masses, to, ever, increasing, accuracy, he, was, also, the, first, chemist, to, use, oxygen, as, the, standard, to, which, other, masses, were, referred, oxygen, is, a, useful, standard, as, unlike, hydrogen, it, forms, compounds, with, most, other, elements, especially, metals, however, he, chose, to, fix, the, atomic, mass, of, oxygen, as, 100, which, did, not, catch, on, charles, fr, d, ric, gerhardt, 1816, 56, henri, victor, regnault, 1810, 78, and, stanislao, cannizzaro, 1826, 1910, expanded, on, berzelius, works, resolving, many, of, the, problems, of, unknown, stoichiometry, of, compounds, and, the, use, of, atomic, masses, attracted, a, large, consensus, by, the, time, of, the, karlsruhe, congress, 1860, the, convention, had, reverted, to, defining, the, atomic, mass, of, hydrogen, as, 1, although, at, the, level, of, precision, of, measurements, at, that, time, relative, uncertainties, of, around, 1, this, was, numerically, equivalent, to, the, later, standard, of, oxygen, 16, however, the, chemical, convenience, of, having, oxygen, as, the, primary, atomic, mass, standard, became, ever, more, evident, with, advances, in, analytical, chemistry, and, the, need, for, ever, more, accurate, atomic, mass, determinations, the, name, mole, is, an, 1897, translation, of, the, german, unit, mol, coined, by, the, chemist, wilhelm, ostwald, in, 1894, from, the, german, word, molek, l, molecule, the, related, concept, of, equivalent, mass, had, been, in, use, at, least, a, century, earlier, developments, in, mass, spectrometry, led, to, the, adoption, of, oxygen, 16, as, the, standard, substance, in, lieu, of, natural, oxygen, the, oxygen, 16, definition, was, replaced, with, one, based, on, carbon, 12, during, the, 1960s, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, defined, the, mole, as, the, amount, of, substance, of, a, system, which, contains, as, many, elementary, entities, as, there, are, atoms, in, 0, 012, kilograms, of, carbon, 12, thus, by, that, definition, one, mole, of, pure, 12, c, had, a, mass, of, exactly, 12, g, the, four, different, definitions, were, equivalent, to, within, 1, because, a, dalton, a, unit, commonly, used, to, measure, atomic, mass, is, exactly, 1, 12, of, the, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, this, definition, of, the, mole, entailed, that, the, mass, of, one, mole, of, a, compound, or, element, in, grams, was, numerically, equal, to, the, average, mass, of, one, molecule, or, atom, of, the, substance, in, daltons, and, that, the, number, of, daltons, in, a, gram, was, equal, to, the, number, of, elementary, entities, in, a, mole, because, the, mass, of, a, nucleon, i, e, a, proton, or, neutron, is, approximately, 1, dalton, and, the, nucleons, in, an, atom, s, nucleus, make, up, the, overwhelming, majority, of, its, mass, this, definition, also, entailed, that, the, mass, of, one, mole, of, a, substance, was, roughly, equivalent, to, the, number, of, nucleons, in, one, atom, or, molecule, of, that, substance, since, the, definition, of, the, gram, was, not, mathematically, tied, to, that, of, the, dalton, the, number, of, molecules, per, mole, n, a, the, avogadro, constant, had, to, be, determined, experimentally, the, experimental, value, adopted, by, codata, in, 2010, is, n, a, 6, 022, 141, 29, 27, 10, 23, mol, 1, in, 2011, the, measurement, was, refined, to, 6, 022, 140, 78, 18, 10, 23, mol, 1, the, mole, was, made, the, seventh, si, base, unit, in, 1971, by, the, 14th, cgpm, before, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, the, mole, was, defined, as, the, amount, of, substance, of, a, system, that, contains, as, many, elementary, entities, as, there, are, atoms, in, 12, grams, of, carbon, 12, the, most, common, isotope, of, carbon, the, term, gram, molecule, was, formerly, used, to, mean, one, mole, of, molecules, and, gram, atom, for, one, mole, of, atoms, for, example, 1, mole, of, mgbr, 2, is, 1, gram, molecule, of, mgbr, 2, but, 3, gram, atoms, of, mgbr, 2, in, 2011, the, 24th, meeting, of, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, agreed, to, a, plan, for, a, possible, revision, of, the, si, base, unit, definitions, at, an, undetermined, date, on, 16, november, 2018, after, a, meeting, of, scientists, from, more, than, 60, countries, at, the, cgpm, in, versailles, france, all, si, base, units, were, defined, in, terms, of, physical, constants, this, meant, that, each, si, unit, including, the, mole, would, not, be, defined, in, terms, of, any, physical, objects, but, rather, they, would, be, defined, by, physical, constants, that, are, in, their, nature, exact, such, changes, officially, came, into, effect, on, 20, may, 2019, following, such, changes, one, mole, of, a, substance, was, redefined, as, containing, exactly, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, elementary, entities, of, that, substance, since, its, adoption, into, the, international, system, of, units, in, 1971, numerous, criticisms, of, the, concept, of, the, mole, as, a, unit, like, the, metre, or, the, second, have, arisen, in, chemistry, it, has, been, known, since, proust, s, law, of, definite, proportions, 1794, that, knowledge, of, the, mass, of, each, of, the, components, in, a, chemical, system, is, not, sufficient, to, define, the, system, amount, of, substance, can, be, described, as, mass, divided, by, proust, s, definite, proportions, and, contains, information, that, is, missing, from, the, measurement, of, mass, alone, as, demonstrated, by, dalton, s, law, of, partial, pressures, 1803, a, measurement, of, mass, is, not, even, necessary, to, measure, the, amount, of, substance, although, in, practice, it, is, usual, there, are, many, physical, relationships, between, amount, of, substance, and, other, physical, quantities, the, most, notable, one, being, the, ideal, gas, law, where, the, relationship, was, first, demonstrated, in, 1857, the, term, mole, was, first, used, in, a, textbook, describing, these, colligative, properties, like, chemists, chemical, engineers, use, the, unit, mole, extensively, but, different, unit, multiples, may, be, more, suitable, for, industrial, use, for, example, the, si, unit, for, volume, is, the, cubic, metre, a, much, larger, unit, than, the, commonly, used, litre, in, the, chemical, laboratory, when, amount, of, substance, is, also, expressed, in, kmol, 1000, mol, in, industrial, scaled, processes, the, numerical, value, of, molarity, remains, the, same, as, kmol, m, 3, 1000, mol, 1000, l, mol, l, textstyle, frac, text, kmol, text, m, 3, frac, 1000, text, mol, 1000, text, l, frac, text, mol, text, l, chemical, engineers, once, used, the, kilogram, mole, notation, kg, mol, which, is, defined, as, the, number, of, entities, in, 12, kg, of, 12, c, and, often, referred, to, the, mole, as, the, gram, mole, notation, g, mol, then, defined, as, the, number, of, entities, in, 12, g, of, 12, c, when, dealing, with, laboratory, data, late, 20th, century, chemical, engineering, practice, came, to, use, the, kilomole, kmol, which, was, numerically, identical, to, the, kilogram, mole, until, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, which, redefined, the, mole, by, fixing, the, value, of, the, avogadro, constant, making, it, very, nearly, equivalent, to, but, no, longer, exactly, equal, to, the, gram, mole, but, whose, name, and, symbol, adopt, the, si, convention, for, standard, multiples, of, metric, units, thus, kmol, means, 1000, mol, this, is, equivalent, to, the, use, of, kg, instead, of, g, the, use, of, kmol, is, not, only, for, magnitude, convenience, but, also, makes, the, equations, used, for, modelling, chemical, engineering, systems, coherent, for, example, the, conversion, of, a, flowrate, of, kg, s, to, kmol, s, only, requires, dividing, by, the, molar, mass, in, g, mol, as, kg, kmol, 1000, g, 1000, mol, g, mol, textstyle, frac, text, kg, text, kmol, frac, 1000, text, g, 1000, text, mol, frac, text, g, text, mol, without, multiplying, by, 1000, unless, the, basic, si, unit, of, mol, s, were, to, be, used, which, would, otherwise, require, the, molar, mass, to, be, converted, to, kg, mol, for, convenience, in, avoiding, conversions, in, the, imperial, or, us, customary, units, some, engineers, adopted, the, pound, mole, notation, lb, mol, or, lbmol, which, is, defined, as, the, number, of, entities, in, 12, lb, of, 12, c, one, lb, mol, is, equal, to, 453, 592, 37, g, mol, which, is, the, same, numerical, value, as, the, number, of, grams, in, an, international, avoirdupois, pound, greenhouse, and, growth, chamber, lighting, for, plants, is, sometimes, expressed, in, micromoles, per, square, metre, per, second, where, 1, mol, photons, 6, 02, 10, 23, photons, the, obsolete, unit, einstein, is, variously, defined, as, the, energy, in, one, mole, of, photons, and, also, as, simply, one, mole, of, photons, the, only, si, derived, unit, with, a, special, name, derived, from, the, mole, is, the, katal, defined, as, one, mole, per, second, of, catalytic, activity, like, other, si, units, the, mole, can, also, be, modified, by, adding, a, metric, prefix, that, multiplies, it, by, a, power, of, 10, one, femtomole, is, exactly, 602, 214, 076, molecules, attomole, and, smaller, quantities, cannot, be, exactly, realized, the, yoctomole, equal, to, around, 0, 6, of, an, individual, molecule, did, make, appearances, in, scientific, journals, in, the, year, the, yocto, prefix, was, officially, implemented, october, 23, denoted, 10, 23, in, the, us, is, recognized, by, some, as, mole, day, it, is, an, informal, holiday, in, honor, of, the, unit, among, chemists, the, date, is, derived, from, the, avogadro, number, which, is, approximately, 6, 022, 10, 23, it, starts, at, 6, 02, a, m, and, ends, at, 6, 02, p, m, alternatively, some, chemists, celebrate, june, 2, 06, 02, june, 22, 6, 22, or, 6, february, 06, 02, a, reference, to, the, 6, 02, or, 6, 022, part, of, the, constant
