the, ring, nebula, also, catalogued, as, messier, 57, m57, and, ngc, 6720, is, a, planetary, nebula, in, the, northern, constellation, of, lyra, such, a, nebula, is, formed, when, a, star, during, the, last, stages, of, its, evolution, before, becoming, a, white, dwarf, expels, a, vast, luminous, envelope, of, ionized, gas, into, the, surrounding, interstellar, space, this, nebula, was, discovered, by, the, french, astronomer, charles, messier, while, searching, for, comets, in, late, january, 1779, messier, s, report, of, his, independent, discovery, of, comet, bode, reached, fellow, french, astronomer, antoine, darquier, de, pellepoix, two, weeks, later, who, then, independently, rediscovered, the, nebula, while, following, the, comet, darquier, later, reported, that, it, was, as, large, as, jupiter, and, resembles, a, planet, which, is, fading, which, may, have, contributed, to, the, use, of, the, persistent, planetary, nebula, terminology, it, would, be, entered, into, messier, s, catalogue, as, the, 57th, object, messier, and, german, born, astronomer, william, herschel, speculated, that, the, nebula, was, formed, by, multiple, faint, stars, that, were, unresolvable, with, his, telescope, in, 1800, german, count, friedrich, von, hahn, announced, that, he, had, discovered, the, faint, central, star, at, the, heart, of, the, nebula, a, few, years, earlier, he, also, noted, that, the, interior, of, the, ring, had, undergone, changes, and, said, he, could, no, longer, find, the, central, star, in, 1864, english, amateur, astronomer, william, huggins, examined, the, spectra, of, multiple, nebulae, discovering, that, some, of, these, objects, including, m57, displayed, the, spectra, of, bright, emission, lines, characteristic, of, fluorescing, glowing, gases, huggins, concluded, that, most, planetary, nebulae, were, not, composed, of, unresolved, stars, as, had, been, previously, suspected, but, were, nebulosities, the, nebula, was, first, photographed, by, the, hungarian, astronomer, eugene, von, gothard, in, 1886, m57, is, found, south, of, the, bright, star, vega, which, forms, the, northwestern, vertex, of, the, summer, triangle, asterism, the, nebula, lies, about, 40, of, the, distance, from, beta, to, gamma, lyrae, making, it, an, easy, target, for, amateur, astronomers, to, find, the, nebula, disk, has, an, angular, size, of, 1, 5, 1, arcminutes, making, it, too, small, to, be, resolved, with, 10, 50, binoculars, it, is, best, observed, using, a, telescope, with, an, aperture, of, at, least, 20, cm, 8, in, but, even, a, 7, 5, cm, 3, in, telescope, will, reveal, its, elliptical, ring, shape, using, a, uhc, or, oiii, filter, greatly, enhances, visual, observation, particularly, in, light, polluted, areas, the, interior, hole, can, be, resolved, by, a, 10, cm, 4, in, instrument, at, a, magnification, of, 100, larger, instruments, will, show, a, few, darker, zones, on, the, eastern, and, western, edges, of, the, ring, and, some, faint, nebulosity, inside, the, disk, the, central, star, at, magnitude, 14, 8, is, difficult, to, spot, m57, is, 0, 787, kpc, 2, 570, light, years, from, earth, it, has, a, visual, magnitude, of, 8, 8, and, a, dimmer, photographic, magnitude, of, 9, 7, photographs, taken, over, a, period, of, 50, years, show, the, rate, of, nebula, expansion, is, roughly, 1, arcsecond, per, century, which, corresponds, to, spectroscopic, observations, as, 20, 30, km, s, m57, is, illuminated, by, a, central, white, dwarf, of, 15, 75v, visual, magnitude, all, the, interior, parts, of, this, nebula, have, a, blue, green, tinge, that, is, caused, by, the, doubly, ionized, oxygen, emission, lines, at, 495, 7, and, 500, 7, nm, these, observed, so, called, forbidden, lines, occur, only, in, conditions, of, very, low, density, containing, a, few, atoms, per, cubic, centimeter, in, the, outer, region, of, the, ring, part, of, the, reddish, hue, is, caused, by, hydrogen, emission, at, 656, 3, nm, forming, part, of, the, balmer, series, of, lines, forbidden, lines, of, ionized, nitrogen, or, n, ii, contribute, to, the, reddishness, at, 654, 8, and, 658, 3, nm, m57, is, of, the, class, of, such, starburst, nebulae, known, as, bipolar, whose, thick, equatorial, rings, visibly, extend, the, structure, through, its, main, axis, of, symmetry, it, appears, to, be, a, prolate, spheroid, with, strong, concentrations, of, material, along, its, equator, from, earth, the, symmetrical, axis, is, viewed, at, about, 30, overall, the, observed, nebulosity, has, been, currently, estimated, to, be, expanding, for, approximately, 1, 610, 240, years, structural, studies, find, this, planetary, exhibits, knots, characterized, by, well, developed, symmetry, however, these, are, only, silhouettes, visible, against, the, background, emission, of, the, nebula, s, equatorial, ring, m57, may, include, internal, n, ii, emission, lines, located, at, the, knots, tips, that, face, the, central, star, however, most, of, these, knots, are, neutral, and, appear, only, in, extinction, lines, their, existence, shows, they, are, probably, only, located, closer, to, the, ionization, front, than, those, found, in, the, lupus, planetary, ic, 4406, some, of, the, knots, do, exhibit, well, developed, tails, which, are, often, detectable, in, optical, thickness, from, the, visual, spectrum, the, central, star, was, discovered, by, hungarian, astronomer, jen, gothard, on, september, 1, 1886, from, images, taken, at, his, observatory, in, her, ny, near, szombathely, within, the, last, two, thousand, years, the, central, star, of, the, ring, nebula, has, left, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, after, exhausting, its, supply, of, hydrogen, fuel, thus, it, no, longer, produces, its, energy, through, nuclear, fusion, and, in, evolutionary, terms, it, is, now, becoming, a, compact, white, dwarf, star, the, central, star, now, consists, primarily, of, carbon, and, oxygen, with, a, thin, outer, envelope, composed, of, lighter, elements, its, mass, is, about, 0, 61, 0, 62, m, with, a, surface, temperature, of, 125, 000, 5, 000, k, currently, it, is, 200, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, but, its, apparent, magnitude, is, only, 15, 75
