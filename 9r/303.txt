a, chemical, formula, is, a, way, of, presenting, information, about, the, chemical, proportions, of, atoms, that, constitute, a, particular, chemical, compound, or, molecule, using, chemical, element, symbols, numbers, and, sometimes, also, other, symbols, such, as, parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas, and, plus, and, minus, signs, these, are, limited, to, a, single, typographic, line, of, symbols, which, may, include, subscripts, and, superscripts, a, chemical, formula, is, not, a, chemical, name, since, it, does, not, contain, any, words, although, a, chemical, formula, may, imply, certain, simple, chemical, structures, it, is, not, the, same, as, a, full, chemical, structural, formula, chemical, formulae, can, fully, specify, the, structure, of, only, the, simplest, of, molecules, and, chemical, substances, and, are, generally, more, limited, in, power, than, chemical, names, and, structural, formulae, the, simplest, types, of, chemical, formulae, are, called, empirical, formulae, which, use, letters, and, numbers, indicating, the, numerical, proportions, of, atoms, of, each, type, molecular, formulae, indicate, the, simple, numbers, of, each, type, of, atom, in, a, molecule, with, no, information, on, structure, for, example, the, empirical, formula, for, glucose, is, ch, 2, o, twice, as, many, hydrogen, atoms, as, carbon, and, oxygen, while, its, molecular, formula, is, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, 12, hydrogen, atoms, six, carbon, and, oxygen, atoms, sometimes, a, chemical, formula, is, complicated, by, being, written, as, a, condensed, formula, or, condensed, molecular, formula, occasionally, called, a, semi, structural, formula, which, conveys, additional, information, about, the, particular, ways, in, which, the, atoms, are, chemically, bonded, together, either, in, covalent, bonds, ionic, bonds, or, various, combinations, of, these, types, this, is, possible, if, the, relevant, bonding, is, easy, to, show, in, one, dimension, an, example, is, the, condensed, molecular, chemical, formula, for, ethanol, which, is, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, or, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, however, even, a, condensed, chemical, formula, is, necessarily, limited, in, its, ability, to, show, complex, bonding, relationships, between, atoms, especially, atoms, that, have, bonds, to, four, or, more, different, substituents, since, a, chemical, formula, must, be, expressed, as, a, single, line, of, chemical, element, symbols, it, often, cannot, be, as, informative, as, a, true, structural, formula, which, is, a, graphical, representation, of, the, spatial, relationship, between, atoms, in, chemical, compounds, see, for, example, the, figure, for, butane, structural, and, chemical, formulae, at, right, for, reasons, of, structural, complexity, a, single, condensed, chemical, formula, or, semi, structural, formula, may, correspond, to, different, molecules, known, as, isomers, for, example, glucose, shares, its, molecular, formula, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, with, a, number, of, other, sugars, including, fructose, galactose, and, mannose, linear, equivalent, chemical, names, exist, that, can, and, do, specify, uniquely, any, complex, structural, formula, see, chemical, nomenclature, but, such, names, must, use, many, terms, words, rather, than, the, simple, element, symbols, numbers, and, simple, typographical, symbols, that, define, a, chemical, formula, chemical, formulae, may, be, used, in, chemical, equations, to, describe, chemical, reactions, and, other, chemical, transformations, such, as, the, dissolving, of, ionic, compounds, into, solution, while, as, noted, chemical, formulae, do, not, have, the, full, power, of, structural, formulae, to, show, chemical, relationships, between, atoms, they, are, sufficient, to, keep, track, of, numbers, of, atoms, and, numbers, of, electrical, charges, in, chemical, reactions, thus, balancing, chemical, equations, so, that, these, equations, can, be, used, in, chemical, problems, involving, conservation, of, atoms, and, conservation, of, electric, charge, a, chemical, formula, identifies, each, constituent, element, by, its, chemical, symbol, and, indicates, the, proportionate, number, of, atoms, of, each, element, in, empirical, formulae, these, proportions, begin, with, a, key, element, and, then, assign, numbers, of, atoms, of, the, other, elements, in, the, compound, by, ratios, to, the, key, element, for, molecular, compounds, these, ratio, numbers, can, all, be, expressed, as, whole, numbers, for, example, the, empirical, formula, of, ethanol, may, be, written, c, 2, h, 6, o, because, the, molecules, of, ethanol, all, contain, two, carbon, atoms, six, hydrogen, atoms, and, one, oxygen, atom, some, types, of, ionic, compounds, however, cannot, be, written, with, entirely, whole, number, empirical, formulae, an, example, is, boron, carbide, whose, formula, of, cb, n, is, a, variable, non, whole, number, ratio, with, n, ranging, from, over, 4, to, more, than, 6, 5, when, the, chemical, compound, of, the, formula, consists, of, simple, molecules, chemical, formulae, often, employ, ways, to, suggest, the, structure, of, the, molecule, these, types, of, formulae, are, variously, known, as, molecular, formulae, and, condensed, formulae, a, molecular, formula, enumerates, the, number, of, atoms, to, reflect, those, in, the, molecule, so, that, the, molecular, formula, for, glucose, is, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, rather, than, the, glucose, empirical, formula, which, is, ch, 2, o, however, except, for, very, simple, substances, molecular, chemical, formulae, lack, needed, structural, information, and, are, ambiguous, for, simple, molecules, a, condensed, or, semi, structural, formula, is, a, type, of, chemical, formula, that, may, fully, imply, a, correct, structural, formula, for, example, ethanol, may, be, represented, by, the, condensed, chemical, formula, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, and, dimethyl, ether, by, the, condensed, formula, ch, 3, och, 3, these, two, molecules, have, the, same, empirical, and, molecular, formulae, c, 2, h, 6, o, but, may, be, differentiated, by, the, condensed, formulae, shown, which, are, sufficient, to, represent, the, full, structure, of, these, simple, organic, compounds, condensed, chemical, formulae, may, also, be, used, to, represent, ionic, compounds, that, do, not, exist, as, discrete, molecules, but, nonetheless, do, contain, covalently, bound, clusters, within, them, these, polyatomic, ions, are, groups, of, atoms, that, are, covalently, bound, together, and, have, an, overall, ionic, charge, such, as, the, sulfate, 2, ion, each, polyatomic, ion, in, a, compound, is, written, individually, in, order, to, illustrate, the, separate, groupings, for, example, the, compound, dichlorine, hexoxide, has, an, empirical, formula, clo, 3, and, molecular, formula, cl, 2, o, 6, but, in, liquid, or, solid, forms, this, compound, is, more, correctly, shown, by, an, ionic, condensed, formula, which, illustrates, that, this, compound, consists, of, ions, and, ions, in, such, cases, the, condensed, formula, only, need, be, complex, enough, to, show, at, least, one, of, each, ionic, species, chemical, formulae, as, described, here, are, distinct, from, the, far, more, complex, chemical, systematic, names, that, are, used, in, various, systems, of, chemical, nomenclature, for, example, one, systematic, name, for, glucose, is, 2, r, 3, s, 4, r, 5, r, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, pentahydroxyhexanal, this, name, interpreted, by, the, rules, behind, it, fully, specifies, glucose, s, structural, formula, but, the, name, is, not, a, chemical, formula, as, usually, understood, and, uses, terms, and, words, not, used, in, chemical, formulae, such, names, unlike, basic, formulae, may, be, able, to, represent, full, structural, formulae, without, graphs, in, chemistry, the, empirical, formula, of, a, chemical, is, a, simple, expression, of, the, relative, number, of, each, type, of, atom, or, ratio, of, the, elements, in, the, compound, empirical, formulae, are, the, standard, for, ionic, compounds, such, as, cacl, 2, and, for, macromolecules, such, as, sio, 2, an, empirical, formula, makes, no, reference, to, isomerism, structure, or, absolute, number, of, atoms, the, term, empirical, refers, to, the, process, of, elemental, analysis, a, technique, of, analytical, chemistry, used, to, determine, the, relative, percent, composition, of, a, pure, chemical, substance, by, element, for, example, hexane, has, a, molecular, formula, of, c, 6, h, 14, and, for, one, of, its, isomers, n, hexane, a, structural, formula, ch, 3, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 3, implying, that, it, has, a, chain, structure, of, 6, carbon, atoms, and, 14, hydrogen, atoms, however, the, empirical, formula, for, hexane, is, c, 3, h, 7, likewise, the, empirical, formula, for, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, is, simply, ho, expressing, the, 1, 1, ratio, of, component, elements, formaldehyde, and, acetic, acid, have, the, same, empirical, formula, ch, 2, o, this, is, also, the, molecular, formula, for, formaldehyde, but, acetic, acid, has, double, the, number, of, atoms, like, the, other, formula, types, detailed, below, an, empirical, formula, shows, the, number, of, elements, in, a, molecule, and, determines, whether, it, is, a, binary, compound, ternary, compound, quaternary, compound, or, has, even, more, elements, molecular, formulae, simply, indicate, the, numbers, of, each, type, of, atom, in, a, molecule, of, a, molecular, substance, they, are, the, same, as, empirical, formulae, for, molecules, that, only, have, one, atom, of, a, particular, type, but, otherwise, may, have, larger, numbers, an, example, of, the, difference, is, the, empirical, formula, for, glucose, which, is, ch, 2, o, ratio, 1, 2, 1, while, its, molecular, formula, is, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, number, of, atoms, 6, 12, 6, for, water, both, formulae, are, h, 2, o, a, molecular, formula, provides, more, information, about, a, molecule, than, its, empirical, formula, but, is, more, difficult, to, establish, in, addition, to, indicating, the, number, of, atoms, of, each, elementa, molecule, a, structural, formula, indicates, how, the, atoms, are, organized, and, shows, or, implies, the, chemical, bonds, between, the, atoms, there, are, multiple, types, of, structural, formulas, focused, on, different, aspects, of, the, molecular, structure, the, two, diagrams, show, two, molecules, which, are, structural, isomers, of, each, other, since, they, both, have, the, same, molecular, formula, c, 4, h, 10, but, they, have, different, structural, formulas, as, shown, the, connectivity, of, a, molecule, often, has, a, strong, influence, on, its, physical, and, chemical, properties, and, behavior, two, molecules, composed, of, the, same, numbers, of, the, same, types, of, atoms, i, e, a, pair, of, isomers, might, have, completely, different, chemical, and, or, physical, properties, if, the, atoms, are, connected, differently, or, in, different, positions, in, such, cases, a, structural, formula, is, useful, as, it, illustrates, which, atoms, are, bonded, to, which, other, ones, from, the, connectivity, it, is, often, possible, to, deduce, the, approximate, shape, of, the, molecule, a, condensed, or, semi, structural, formula, may, represent, the, types, and, spatial, arrangement, of, bonds, in, a, simple, chemical, substance, though, it, does, not, necessarily, specify, isomers, or, complex, structures, for, example, ethane, consists, of, two, carbon, atoms, single, bonded, to, each, other, with, each, carbon, atom, having, three, hydrogen, atoms, bonded, to, it, its, chemical, formula, can, be, rendered, as, ch, 3, ch, 3, in, ethylene, there, is, a, double, bond, between, the, carbon, atoms, and, thus, each, carbon, only, has, two, hydrogens, therefore, the, chemical, formula, may, be, written, ch, 2, ch, 2, and, the, fact, that, there, is, a, double, bond, between, the, carbons, is, implicit, because, carbon, has, a, valence, of, four, however, a, more, explicit, method, is, to, write, h, 2, c, ch, 2, or, less, commonly, h, 2, c, ch, 2, the, two, lines, or, two, pairs, of, dots, indicate, that, a, double, bond, connects, the, atoms, on, either, side, of, them, a, triple, bond, may, be, expressed, with, three, lines, hc, ch, or, three, pairs, of, dots, hc, ch, and, if, there, may, be, ambiguity, a, single, line, or, pair, of, dots, may, be, used, to, indicate, a, single, bond, molecules, with, multiple, functional, groups, that, are, the, same, may, be, expressed, by, enclosing, the, repeated, group, in, round, brackets, for, example, isobutane, may, be, written, ch, 3, 3, ch, this, condensed, structural, formula, implies, a, different, connectivity, from, other, molecules, that, can, be, formed, using, the, same, atoms, in, the, same, proportions, isomers, the, formula, ch, 3, 3, ch, implies, a, central, carbon, atom, connected, to, one, hydrogen, atom, and, three, methyl, groups, ch, 3, the, same, number, of, atoms, of, each, element, 10, hydrogens, and, 4, carbons, or, c, 4, h, 10, may, be, used, to, make, a, straight, chain, molecule, n, butane, ch, 3, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 3, the, alkene, called, but, 2, ene, has, two, isomers, which, the, chemical, formula, ch, 3, ch, chch, 3, does, not, identify, the, relative, position, of, the, two, methyl, groups, must, be, indicated, by, additional, notation, denoting, whether, the, methyl, groups, are, on, the, same, side, of, the, double, bond, cis, or, z, or, on, the, opposite, sides, from, each, other, trans, or, e, as, noted, above, in, order, to, represent, the, full, structural, formulae, of, many, complex, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, chemical, nomenclature, may, be, needed, which, goes, well, beyond, the, available, resources, used, above, in, simple, condensed, formulae, see, iupac, nomenclature, of, organic, chemistry, and, iupac, nomenclature, of, inorganic, chemistry, 2005, for, examples, in, addition, linear, naming, systems, such, as, international, chemical, identifier, inchi, allow, a, computer, to, construct, a, structural, formula, and, simplified, molecular, input, line, entry, system, smiles, allows, a, more, human, readable, ascii, input, however, all, these, nomenclature, systems, go, beyond, the, standards, of, chemical, formulae, and, technically, are, chemical, naming, systems, not, formula, systems, for, polymers, in, condensed, chemical, formulae, parentheses, are, placed, around, the, repeating, unit, for, example, a, hydrocarbon, molecule, that, is, described, as, ch, 3, ch, 2, 50, ch, 3, is, a, molecule, with, fifty, repeating, units, if, the, number, of, repeating, units, is, unknown, or, variable, the, letter, n, may, be, used, to, indicate, this, formula, ch, 3, ch, 2, n, ch, 3, for, ions, the, charge, on, a, particular, atom, may, be, denoted, with, a, right, hand, superscript, for, example, na, or, cu, 2, the, total, charge, on, a, charged, molecule, or, a, polyatomic, ion, may, also, be, shown, in, this, way, such, as, for, hydronium, h, 3, o, or, sulfate, so, 2, 4, here, and, are, used, in, place, of, 1, and, 1, respectively, for, more, complex, ions, brackets, are, often, used, to, enclose, the, ionic, formula, as, in, 2, which, is, found, in, compounds, such, as, caesium, dodecaborate, cs, 2, parentheses, can, be, nested, inside, brackets, to, indicate, a, repeating, unit, as, in, hexamminecobalt, iii, chloride, 3, cl, 3, here, nh, 3, 6, indicates, that, the, ion, contains, six, ammine, groups, nh, 3, bonded, to, cobalt, and, encloses, the, entire, formula, of, the, ion, with, charge, 3, this, is, strictly, optional, a, chemical, formula, is, valid, with, or, without, ionization, information, and, hexamminecobalt, iii, chloride, may, be, written, as, 3, cl, 3, or, cl, 3, brackets, like, parentheses, behave, in, chemistry, as, they, do, in, mathematics, grouping, terms, together, they, are, not, specifically, employed, only, for, ionization, states, in, the, latter, case, here, the, parentheses, indicate, 6, groups, all, of, the, same, shape, bonded, to, another, group, of, size, 1, the, cobalt, atom, and, then, the, entire, bundle, as, a, group, is, bonded, to, 3, chlorine, atoms, in, the, former, case, it, is, clearer, that, the, bond, connecting, the, chlorines, is, ionic, rather, than, covalent, although, isotopes, are, more, relevant, to, nuclear, chemistry, or, stable, isotope, chemistry, than, to, conventional, chemistry, different, isotopes, may, be, indicated, with, a, prefixed, superscript, in, a, chemical, formula, for, example, the, phosphate, ion, containing, radioactive, phosphorus, 32, is, 3, also, a, study, involving, stable, isotope, ratios, might, include, the, molecule, 18, o, 16, o, a, left, hand, subscript, is, sometimes, used, redundantly, to, indicate, the, atomic, number, for, example, 8, o, 2, for, dioxygen, and, 16, 8, o, 2, for, the, most, abundant, isotopic, species, of, dioxygen, this, is, convenient, when, writing, equations, for, nuclear, reactions, in, order, to, show, the, balance, of, charge, more, clearly, the, symbol, at, sign, indicates, an, atom, or, molecule, trapped, inside, a, cage, but, not, chemically, bound, to, it, for, example, a, buckminsterfullerene, c, 60, with, an, atom, m, would, simply, be, represented, as, mc, 60, regardless, of, whether, m, was, inside, the, fullerene, without, chemical, bonding, or, outside, bound, to, one, of, the, carbon, atoms, using, the, symbol, this, would, be, denoted, m, c, 60, if, m, was, inside, the, carbon, network, a, non, fullerene, example, is, 3, an, ion, in, which, one, arsenic, as, atom, is, trapped, in, a, cage, formed, by, the, other, 32, atoms, this, notation, was, proposed, in, 1991, with, the, discovery, of, fullerene, cages, endohedral, fullerenes, which, can, trap, atoms, such, as, la, to, form, for, example, la, c, 60, or, la, c, 82, the, choice, of, the, symbol, has, been, explained, by, the, authors, as, being, concise, readily, printed, and, transmitted, electronically, the, at, sign, is, included, in, ascii, which, most, modern, character, encoding, schemes, are, based, on, and, the, visual, aspects, suggesting, the, structure, of, an, endohedral, fullerene, chemical, formulae, most, often, use, integers, for, each, element, however, there, is, a, class, of, compounds, called, non, stoichiometric, compounds, that, cannot, be, represented, by, small, integers, such, a, formula, might, be, written, using, decimal, fractions, as, in, fe, 0, 95, o, or, it, might, include, a, variable, part, represented, by, a, letter, as, in, fe, 1, x, o, where, x, is, normally, much, less, than, 1, a, chemical, formula, used, for, a, series, of, compounds, that, differ, from, each, other, by, a, constant, unit, is, called, a, general, formula, it, generates, a, homologous, series, of, chemical, formulae, for, example, alcohols, may, be, represented, by, the, formula, c, n, h, 2, n, 1, oh, n, 1, giving, the, homologs, methanol, ethanol, propanol, for, 1, n, 3, the, hill, system, or, hill, notation, is, a, system, of, writing, empirical, chemical, formulae, molecular, chemical, formulae, and, components, of, a, condensed, formula, such, that, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, in, a, molecule, is, indicated, first, the, number, of, hydrogen, atoms, next, and, then, the, number, of, all, other, chemical, elements, subsequently, in, alphabetical, order, of, the, chemical, symbols, when, the, formula, contains, no, carbon, all, the, elements, including, hydrogen, are, listed, alphabetically, by, sorting, formulae, according, to, the, number, of, atoms, of, each, element, present, in, the, formula, according, to, these, rules, with, differences, in, earlier, elements, or, numbers, being, treated, as, more, significant, than, differences, in, any, later, element, or, number, like, sorting, text, strings, into, lexicographical, order, it, is, possible, to, collate, chemical, formulae, into, what, is, known, as, hill, system, order, the, hill, system, was, first, published, by, edwin, a, hill, of, the, united, states, patent, and, trademark, office, in, 1900, it, is, the, most, commonly, used, system, in, chemical, databases, and, printed, indexes, to, sort, lists, of, compounds, a, list, of, formulae, in, hill, system, order, is, arranged, alphabetically, as, above, with, single, letter, elements, coming, before, two, letter, symbols, when, the, symbols, begin, with, the, same, letter, so, b, comes, before, be, which, comes, before, br, the, following, example, formulae, are, written, using, the, hill, system, and, listed, in, hill, order
