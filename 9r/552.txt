a, drought, is, a, period, of, drier, than, normal, conditions, 1157, a, drought, can, last, for, days, months, or, years, drought, often, has, large, impacts, on, the, ecosystems, and, agriculture, of, affected, regions, and, causes, harm, to, the, local, economy, annual, dry, seasons, in, the, tropics, significantly, increase, the, chances, of, a, drought, developing, with, subsequent, increased, wildfire, risks, heat, waves, can, significantly, worsen, drought, conditions, by, increasing, evapotranspiration, this, dries, out, forests, and, other, vegetation, and, increases, the, amount, of, fuel, for, wildfires, drought, is, a, recurring, feature, of, the, climate, in, most, parts, of, the, world, becoming, more, extreme, and, less, predictable, due, to, climate, change, which, dendrochronological, studies, date, back, to, 1900, there, are, three, kinds, of, drought, effects, environmental, economic, and, social, environmental, effects, include, the, drying, of, wetlands, more, and, larger, wildfires, loss, of, biodiversity, economic, impacts, include, disruption, of, water, supplies, for, people, less, agricultural, productivity, and, therefore, more, expensive, food, production, another, impact, is, shortages, of, water, for, irrigation, or, hydropower, social, and, health, costs, include, the, negative, effect, on, the, health, of, people, directly, exposed, to, this, phenomenon, excessive, heat, waves, high, food, costs, stress, caused, by, failed, harvests, water, scarcity, etc, prolonged, droughts, have, caused, mass, migrations, and, humanitarian, crisis, examples, for, regions, with, increased, drought, risks, are, the, amazon, basin, australia, the, sahel, region, and, india, for, example, in, 2005, parts, of, the, amazon, basin, experienced, the, worst, drought, in, 100, years, australia, could, experience, more, severe, droughts, and, they, could, become, more, frequent, in, the, future, a, government, commissioned, report, said, on, july, 6, 2008, the, long, australian, millennial, drought, broke, in, 2010, the, 2020, 2022, horn, of, africa, drought, has, surpassed, the, horrific, drought, in, 2010, 2011, in, both, duration, and, severity, more, than, 150, districts, in, india, are, drought, vulnerable, mostly, concentrated, in, the, state, of, rajasthan, gujarat, madhya, pradesh, and, its, adjoining, chhattisgarh, uttar, pradesh, northern, karnataka, and, adjoining, maharashtra, of, the, country, throughout, history, humans, have, usually, viewed, droughts, as, disasters, due, to, the, impact, on, food, availability, and, the, rest, of, society, people, have, viewed, drought, as, a, natural, disaster, or, as, something, influenced, by, human, activity, or, as, a, result, of, supernatural, forces, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, defines, a, drought, simply, as, drier, than, normal, conditions, 1157, this, means, that, a, drought, is, a, moisture, deficit, relative, to, the, average, water, availability, at, a, given, location, and, season, 1157, according, to, national, integrated, drought, information, system, a, multi, agency, partnership, drought, is, generally, defined, as, a, deficiency, of, precipitation, over, an, extended, period, of, time, usually, a, season, or, more, resulting, in, a, water, shortage, the, national, weather, service, office, of, the, noaa, defines, drought, as, a, deficiency, of, moisture, that, results, in, adverse, impacts, on, people, animals, or, vegetation, over, a, sizeable, area, drought, is, a, complex, phenomenon, relating, to, the, absence, of, water, which, is, difficult, to, monitor, and, define, by, the, early, 1980s, over, 150, definitions, of, drought, had, already, been, published, the, range, of, definitions, reflects, differences, in, regions, needs, and, disciplinary, approaches, there, are, three, major, categories, of, drought, based, on, where, in, the, water, cycle, the, moisture, deficit, occurs, meteorological, drought, hydrological, drought, and, agricultural, or, ecological, drought, 1157, a, meteorological, drought, occurs, due, to, lack, of, precipitation, a, hydrological, drought, is, related, to, low, runoff, streamflow, and, reservoir, storage, an, agricultural, or, ecological, drought, is, causing, plant, stress, from, a, combination, of, evaporation, and, low, soil, moisture, 1157, some, organizations, add, another, category, socioeconomic, drought, occurs, when, the, demand, for, an, economic, good, exceeds, supply, as, a, result, of, a, weather, related, shortfall, in, water, supply, the, socioeconomic, drought, is, a, similar, concept, to, water, scarcity, the, different, categories, of, droughts, have, different, causes, but, similar, effects, several, indices, have, been, defined, to, quantify, and, monitor, drought, at, different, spatial, and, temporal, scales, a, key, property, of, drought, indices, is, their, spatial, comparability, and, they, must, be, statistically, robust, drought, indices, include, high, resolution, drought, information, helps, to, better, assess, the, spatial, and, temporal, changes, and, variability, in, drought, duration, severity, and, magnitude, at, a, much, finer, scale, this, supports, the, development, of, site, specific, adaptation, measures, the, application, of, multiple, indices, using, different, datasets, helps, to, better, manage, and, monitor, droughts, than, using, a, single, dataset, this, is, particularly, the, case, in, regions, of, the, world, where, not, enough, data, is, available, such, as, africa, and, south, america, using, a, single, dataset, can, be, limiting, as, it, may, not, capture, the, full, spectrum, of, drought, characteristics, and, impacts, careful, monitoring, of, moisture, levels, can, also, help, predict, increased, risk, for, wildfires, mechanisms, of, producing, precipitation, include, convective, stratiform, and, orographic, rainfall, convective, processes, involve, strong, vertical, motions, that, can, cause, the, overturning, of, the, atmosphere, in, that, location, within, an, hour, and, cause, heavy, precipitation, while, stratiform, processes, involve, weaker, upward, motions, and, less, intense, precipitation, over, a, longer, duration, precipitation, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, based, on, whether, it, falls, as, liquid, water, liquid, water, that, freezes, on, contact, with, the, surface, or, ice, droughts, occur, mainly, in, areas, where, normal, levels, of, rainfall, are, in, themselves, low, if, these, factors, do, not, support, precipitation, volumes, sufficiently, to, reach, the, surface, over, a, sufficient, time, the, result, is, a, drought, drought, can, be, triggered, by, a, high, level, of, reflected, sunlight, and, above, average, prevalence, of, high, pressure, systems, winds, carrying, continental, rather, than, oceanic, air, masses, and, ridges, of, high, pressure, areas, aloft, can, prevent, or, restrict, the, developing, of, thunderstorm, activity, or, rainfall, over, one, certain, region, once, a, region, is, within, drought, feedback, mechanisms, such, as, local, arid, air, hot, conditions, which, can, promote, warm, core, ridging, and, minimal, evapotranspiration, can, worsen, drought, conditions, within, the, tropics, distinct, wet, and, dry, seasons, emerge, due, to, the, movement, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, or, monsoon, trough, the, dry, season, greatly, increases, drought, occurrence, and, is, characterized, by, its, low, humidity, with, watering, holes, and, rivers, drying, up, because, of, the, lack, of, these, watering, holes, many, grazing, animals, are, forced, to, migrate, due, to, the, lack, of, water, in, search, of, more, fertile, lands, examples, of, such, animals, are, zebras, elephants, and, wildebeest, because, of, the, lack, of, water, in, the, plants, bushfires, are, common, since, water, vapor, becomes, more, energetic, with, increasing, temperature, more, water, vapor, is, required, to, increase, relative, humidity, values, to, 100, at, higher, temperatures, or, to, get, the, temperature, to, fall, to, the, dew, point, periods, of, warmth, quicken, the, pace, of, fruit, and, vegetable, production, increase, evaporation, and, transpiration, from, plants, and, worsen, drought, conditions, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, phenomenon, can, sometimes, play, a, significant, role, in, drought, enso, comprises, two, patterns, of, temperature, anomalies, in, the, central, pacific, ocean, known, as, la, ni, a, and, el, ni, o, la, ni, a, events, are, generally, associated, with, drier, and, hotter, conditions, and, further, exacerbation, of, drought, in, california, and, the, southwestern, united, states, and, to, some, extent, the, u, s, southeast, meteorological, scientists, have, observed, that, la, ni, as, have, become, more, frequent, over, time, conversely, during, el, ni, o, events, drier, and, hotter, weather, occurs, in, parts, of, the, amazon, river, basin, colombia, and, central, america, winters, during, the, el, ni, o, are, warmer, and, drier, than, average, conditions, in, the, northwest, northern, midwest, and, northern, mideast, united, states, so, those, regions, experience, reduced, snowfalls, conditions, are, also, drier, than, normal, from, december, to, february, in, south, central, africa, mainly, in, zambia, zimbabwe, mozambique, and, botswana, direct, effects, of, el, ni, o, resulting, in, drier, conditions, occur, in, parts, of, southeast, asia, and, northern, australia, increasing, bush, fires, worsening, haze, and, decreasing, air, quality, dramatically, drier, than, normal, conditions, are, also, in, general, observed, in, queensland, inland, victoria, inland, new, south, wales, and, eastern, tasmania, from, june, to, august, as, warm, water, spreads, from, the, west, pacific, and, the, indian, ocean, to, the, east, pacific, it, causes, extensive, drought, in, the, western, pacific, singapore, experienced, the, driest, february, in, 2014, since, records, began, in, 1869, with, only, 6, 3, mm, of, rain, falling, in, the, month, and, temperatures, hitting, as, high, as, 35, c, on, 26, february, the, years, 1968, and, 2005, had, the, next, driest, februaries, when, 8, 4, mm, of, rain, fell, globally, the, occurrence, of, droughts, has, increased, as, a, result, of, the, increase, in, temperature, and, atmospheric, evaporative, demand, in, addition, increased, climate, variability, has, increased, the, frequency, and, severity, of, drought, events, moreover, the, occurrence, and, impact, of, droughts, are, aggravated, by, anthropogenic, activities, such, as, land, use, change, and, water, management, and, demand, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, also, pointed, out, that, warming, over, land, drives, an, increase, in, atmospheric, evaporative, demand, and, in, the, severity, of, drought, events, 1057, and, increased, atmospheric, evaporative, demand, increases, plant, water, stress, leading, to, agricultural, and, ecological, drought, 578, there, is, a, rise, of, compound, warm, season, droughts, in, europe, that, are, concurrent, with, an, increase, in, potential, evapotranspiration, higher, temperatures, increase, evaporation, this, dries, the, soil, and, increases, plant, stress, agriculture, suffers, as, a, result, this, means, even, regions, where, overall, rainfall, is, expected, to, remain, relatively, stable, will, experience, these, impacts, 1157, these, regions, include, central, and, northern, europe, without, climate, change, mitigation, around, one, third, of, land, areas, are, likely, to, experience, moderate, or, more, severe, drought, by, 2100, 1157, due, to, global, warming, droughts, are, more, frequent, and, intense, than, in, the, past, human, activity, can, directly, trigger, exacerbating, factors, such, as, over, farming, excessive, irrigation, deforestation, and, erosion, adversely, impact, the, ability, of, the, land, to, capture, and, hold, water, in, arid, climates, the, main, source, of, erosion, is, wind, erosion, can, be, the, result, of, material, movement, by, the, wind, the, wind, can, cause, small, particles, to, be, lifted, and, therefore, moved, to, another, region, deflation, suspended, particles, within, the, wind, may, impact, on, solid, objects, causing, erosion, by, abrasion, ecological, succession, wind, erosion, generally, occurs, in, areas, with, little, or, no, vegetation, often, in, areas, where, there, is, insufficient, rainfall, to, support, vegetation, drought, is, one, of, the, most, complex, and, major, natural, hazards, and, it, has, devastating, impacts, on, the, environment, economy, water, resources, agriculture, and, society, worldwide, one, can, divide, the, impacts, of, droughts, and, water, shortages, into, three, groups, environmental, economic, and, social, including, health, environmental, effects, of, droughts, include, lower, surface, and, subterranean, water, levels, lower, flow, levels, with, a, decrease, below, the, minimum, leading, to, direct, danger, for, amphibian, life, increased, pollution, of, surface, water, the, drying, out, of, wetlands, more, and, larger, wildfires, higher, deflation, intensity, loss, of, biodiversity, worse, health, of, trees, and, the, appearance, of, pests, and, dendroid, diseases, economic, losses, as, a, result, of, droughts, include, lower, agricultural, forests, game, and, fishing, output, higher, food, production, costs, lower, energy, production, levels, in, hydro, plants, losses, caused, by, depleted, water, tourism, and, transport, revenue, problems, with, water, supply, for, the, energy, sector, and, for, technological, processes, in, metallurgy, mining, the, chemical, paper, wood, foodstuff, industries, etc, disruption, of, water, supplies, for, municipal, economies, further, examples, of, common, environmental, and, economic, consequences, of, drought, include, droughts, can, cause, land, degradation, and, loss, of, soil, moisture, resulting, in, the, destruction, of, cropland, productivity, this, can, result, in, diminished, crop, growth, or, yield, productions, and, carrying, capacity, for, livestock, drought, in, combination, with, high, levels, of, grazing, pressure, can, function, as, the, tipping, point, for, an, ecosystem, causing, woody, encroachment, water, stress, affects, plant, development, and, quality, in, a, variety, of, ways, firstly, drought, can, cause, poor, germination, and, impaired, seedling, development, at, the, same, time, plant, growth, relies, on, cellular, division, cell, enlargement, and, differentiation, drought, stress, impairs, mitosis, and, cell, elongation, via, loss, of, turgor, pressure, which, results, in, poor, growth, development, of, leaves, is, also, dependent, upon, turgor, pressure, concentration, of, nutrients, and, carbon, assimilates, all, of, which, are, reduced, by, drought, conditions, thus, drought, stress, lead, to, a, decrease, in, leaf, size, and, number, plant, height, biomass, leaf, size, and, stem, girth, has, been, shown, to, decrease, in, maize, under, water, limiting, conditions, crop, yield, is, also, negatively, effected, by, drought, stress, the, reduction, in, crop, yield, results, from, a, decrease, in, photosynthetic, rate, changes, in, leaf, development, and, altered, allocation, of, resources, all, due, to, drought, stress, crop, plants, exposed, to, drought, stress, suffer, from, reductions, in, leaf, water, potential, and, transpiration, rate, water, use, efficiency, increases, in, crops, such, as, wheat, while, decreasing, in, others, such, as, potatoes, plants, need, water, for, the, uptake, of, nutrients, from, the, soil, and, for, the, transport, of, nutrients, throughout, the, plant, drought, conditions, limit, these, functions, leading, to, stunted, growth, drought, stress, also, causes, a, decrease, in, photosynthetic, activity, in, plants, due, to, the, reduction, of, photosynthetic, tissues, stomatal, closure, and, reduced, performance, of, photosynthetic, machinery, this, reduction, in, photosynthetic, activity, contributes, to, the, reduction, in, plant, growth, and, yields, another, factor, influencing, reduced, plant, growth, and, yields, include, the, allocation, of, resources, following, drought, stress, plants, will, allocate, more, resources, to, roots, to, aid, in, water, uptake, increasing, root, growth, and, reducing, the, growth, of, other, plant, parts, while, decreasing, yields, the, most, negative, impacts, of, drought, for, humans, include, crop, failure, food, crisis, famine, malnutrition, and, poverty, which, lead, to, loss, of, life, and, mass, migration, of, people, there, are, negative, effects, on, the, health, of, people, who, are, directly, exposed, to, this, phenomenon, excessive, heat, waves, droughts, can, also, cause, limitations, of, water, supplies, increased, water, pollution, levels, high, food, costs, stress, caused, by, failed, harvests, water, scarcity, etc, reduced, water, quality, can, occur, because, lower, water, flows, reduce, dilution, of, pollutants, and, increase, contamination, of, remaining, water, sources, this, explains, why, droughts, and, water, scarcity, operate, as, a, factor, which, increases, the, gap, between, developed, and, developing, countries, effects, vary, according, to, vulnerability, for, example, subsistence, farmers, are, more, likely, to, migrate, during, drought, because, they, do, not, have, alternative, food, sources, areas, with, populations, that, depend, on, water, sources, as, a, major, food, source, are, more, vulnerable, to, famine, further, examples, of, social, and, health, consequences, include, wind, erosion, is, much, more, severe, in, arid, areas, and, during, times, of, drought, for, example, in, the, great, plains, it, is, estimated, that, soil, loss, due, to, wind, erosion, can, be, as, much, as, 6100, times, greater, in, drought, years, than, in, wet, years, loess, is, a, homogeneous, typically, nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly, coherent, often, calcareous, fine, grained, silty, pale, yellow, or, buff, windblown, aeolian, sediment, it, generally, occurs, as, a, widespread, blanket, deposit, that, covers, areas, of, hundreds, of, square, kilometers, and, tens, of, meters, thick, loess, often, stands, in, either, steep, or, vertical, faces, loess, tends, to, develop, into, highly, rich, soils, under, appropriate, climatic, conditions, areas, with, loess, are, among, the, most, agriculturally, productive, in, the, world, loess, deposits, are, geologically, unstable, by, nature, and, will, erode, very, readily, therefore, windbreaks, such, as, big, trees, and, bushes, are, often, planted, by, farmers, to, reduce, the, wind, erosion, of, loess, in, 2005, parts, of, the, amazon, basin, experienced, the, worst, drought, in, 100, years, a, 2006, article, reported, results, showing, that, the, forest, in, its, present, form, could, survive, only, three, years, of, drought, scientists, at, the, brazilian, national, institute, of, amazonian, research, argue, in, the, article, that, this, drought, response, coupled, with, the, effects, of, deforestation, on, regional, climate, are, pushing, the, rainforest, towards, a, tipping, point, where, it, would, irreversibly, start, to, die, it, concludes, that, the, rainforest, is, on, the, brink, of, being, turned, into, savanna, or, desert, with, catastrophic, consequences, for, the, world, s, climate, according, to, the, wwf, the, combination, of, climate, change, and, deforestation, increases, the, drying, effect, of, dead, trees, that, fuels, forest, fires, the, 1997, 2009, millennium, drought, in, australia, led, to, a, water, supply, crisis, across, much, of, the, country, as, a, result, many, desalination, plants, were, built, for, the, first, time, see, list, by, far, the, largest, part, of, australia, is, desert, or, semi, arid, lands, commonly, known, as, the, outback, a, 2005, study, by, australian, and, american, researchers, investigated, the, desertification, of, the, interior, and, suggested, that, one, explanation, was, related, to, human, settlers, who, arrived, about, 50, 000, years, ago, regular, burning, by, these, settlers, could, have, prevented, monsoons, from, reaching, interior, australia, in, june, 2008, it, became, known, that, an, expert, panel, had, warned, of, long, term, maybe, irreversible, severe, ecological, damage, for, the, whole, murray, darling, basin, if, it, did, not, receive, sufficient, water, by, october, 2008, australia, could, experience, more, severe, droughts, and, they, could, become, more, frequent, in, the, future, a, government, commissioned, report, said, on, july, 6, 2008, australian, environmentalist, tim, flannery, predicted, that, unless, it, made, drastic, changes, perth, in, western, australia, could, become, the, world, s, first, ghost, metropolis, an, abandoned, city, with, no, more, water, to, sustain, its, population, the, long, australian, millennial, drought, broke, in, 2010, recurring, droughts, leading, to, desertification, in, east, africa, have, created, grave, ecological, catastrophes, prompting, food, shortages, in, 1984, 85, 2006, and, 2011, during, the, 2011, drought, an, estimated, 50, 000, to, 150, 000, people, were, reported, to, have, died, though, these, figures, and, the, extent, of, the, crisis, are, disputed, in, february, 2012, the, un, announced, that, the, crisis, was, over, due, to, a, scaling, up, of, relief, efforts, and, a, bumper, harvest, aid, agencies, subsequently, shifted, their, emphasis, to, recovery, efforts, including, digging, irrigation, canals, and, distributing, plant, seeds, the, 2020, 2022, horn, of, africa, drought, has, surpassed, the, horrific, drought, in, 2010, 2011, in, both, duration, and, severity, the, darfur, conflict, in, sudan, also, affecting, chad, was, fueled, by, decades, of, drought, combination, of, drought, desertification, and, overpopulation, are, among, the, causes, of, the, darfur, conflict, because, the, arab, baggara, nomads, searching, for, water, have, to, take, their, livestock, further, south, to, land, mainly, occupied, by, non, arab, farming, people, in, 2012, a, severe, drought, struck, the, western, sahel, more, than, 10, million, people, in, the, region, were, at, risk, of, famine, due, to, a, month, long, heat, wave, that, was, hovering, over, niger, mali, mauritania, and, burkina, faso, approximately, 2, 4, billion, people, live, in, the, drainage, basin, of, the, himalayan, rivers, india, china, pakistan, bangladesh, nepal, and, myanmar, could, experience, floods, followed, by, droughts, in, coming, decades, more, than, 150, districts, in, india, are, drought, vulnerable, mostly, concentrated, in, the, state, of, rajasthan, gujarat, madhya, pradesh, and, its, adjoining, chhattisgarh, uttar, pradesh, northern, karnataka, and, adjoining, maharashtra, of, the, country, drought, in, india, affecting, the, ganges, is, of, particular, concern, as, it, provides, drinking, water, and, agricultural, irrigation, for, more, than, 500, million, people, the, west, coast, of, north, america, which, gets, much, of, its, water, from, glaciers, in, mountain, ranges, such, as, the, rocky, mountains, and, sierra, nevada, also, would, be, affected, droughts, in, particular, countries, see, also, agriculturally, people, can, effectively, mitigate, much, of, the, impact, of, drought, through, irrigation, and, crop, rotation, failure, to, develop, adequate, drought, mitigation, strategies, carries, a, grave, human, cost, in, the, modern, era, exacerbated, by, ever, increasing, population, densities, strategies, for, drought, protection, or, mitigation, include, when, water, is, scarce, due, to, droughts, there, are, a, range, of, options, for, people, to, access, other, sources, of, water, such, as, wastewater, reuse, rainwater, harvesting, and, stormwater, recovery, or, seawater, desalination, throughout, history, humans, have, usually, viewed, droughts, as, disasters, due, to, the, impact, on, food, availability, and, the, rest, of, society, drought, is, among, the, earliest, documented, climatic, events, present, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, and, tied, to, the, biblical, story, of, joseph, s, arrival, in, and, the, later, exodus, from, ancient, egypt, hunter, gatherer, migrations, in, 9, 500, bc, chile, have, been, linked, to, the, phenomenon, as, has, the, exodus, of, early, humans, out, of, africa, and, into, the, rest, of, the, world, around, 135, 000, years, ago, droughts, can, be, scientifically, explained, in, terms, of, physical, mechanisms, which, underlie, natural, disasters, and, are, influenced, by, human, impact, on, the, environment, beliefs, about, drought, are, further, shaped, by, cultural, factors, including, local, knowledge, perceptions, values, beliefs, and, religion, in, some, places, and, times, droughts, have, been, interpreted, as, the, work, of, supernatural, forces, globally, people, in, many, societies, have, been, more, likely, to, explain, natural, events, like, drought, famine, and, disease, in, terms, of, the, supernatural, than, they, are, to, explain, social, phenomena, like, war, murder, and, theft, historically, rituals, have, been, used, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, or, avert, drought, rainmaking, rituals, have, ranged, from, dances, to, scapegoating, to, human, sacrifices, many, ancient, practices, are, now, a, matter, of, folklore, while, others, may, still, be, practiced, in, areas, where, people, have, limited, understanding, of, the, scientific, basis, of, drought, beliefs, about, drought, continue, to, reflect, indigenous, beliefs, in, the, power, of, spirits, and, christian, philosophies, that, see, drought, as, a, divine, punishment, such, beliefs, can, influence, people, s, thinking, and, affect, their, resilience, and, ability, to, adapt, to, stress, and, respond, to, crises, in, the, case, of, creationism, curricula, sometimes, give, religious, explanations, of, natural, phenomena, rather, than, scientific, ones, teaching, explicitly, denies, evolution, that, human, agency, is, affecting, climate, and, that, climate, change, is, occurring, some, historical, droughts, include
