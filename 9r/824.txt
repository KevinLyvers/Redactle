quantum, gravity, qg, is, a, field, of, theoretical, physics, that, seeks, to, describe, gravity, according, to, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, it, deals, with, environments, in, which, neither, gravitational, nor, quantum, effects, can, be, ignored, such, as, in, the, vicinity, of, black, holes, or, similar, compact, astrophysical, objects, such, as, neutron, stars, as, well, as, in, the, early, stages, of, the, universe, moments, after, the, big, bang, three, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, are, described, within, the, framework, of, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, field, theory, the, electromagnetic, interaction, the, strong, force, and, the, weak, force, this, leaves, gravity, as, the, only, interaction, that, has, not, been, fully, accommodated, the, current, understanding, of, gravity, is, based, on, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, which, incorporates, his, theory, of, special, relativity, and, deeply, modifies, the, understanding, of, concepts, like, time, and, space, although, general, relativity, is, highly, regarded, for, its, elegance, and, accuracy, it, has, limitations, the, gravitational, singularities, inside, black, holes, the, ad, hoc, postulation, of, dark, matter, as, well, as, dark, energy, and, its, relation, to, the, cosmological, constant, are, among, the, current, unsolved, mysteries, regarding, gravity, all, of, which, signal, the, collapse, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, at, different, scales, and, highlight, the, need, for, a, gravitational, theory, that, goes, into, the, quantum, realm, at, distances, close, to, the, planck, length, like, those, near, the, center, of, a, black, hole, quantum, fluctuations, of, spacetime, are, expected, to, play, an, important, role, finally, the, discrepancies, between, the, predicted, value, for, the, vacuum, energy, and, the, observed, values, which, depending, on, considerations, can, be, of, 60, or, 120, orders, of, magnitude, highlight, the, necessity, for, a, quantum, theory, of, gravity, the, field, of, quantum, gravity, is, actively, developing, and, theorists, are, exploring, a, variety, of, approaches, to, the, problem, of, quantum, gravity, the, most, popular, being, m, theory, and, loop, quantum, gravity, all, of, these, approaches, aim, to, describe, the, quantum, behavior, of, the, gravitational, field, which, does, not, necessarily, include, unifying, all, fundamental, interactions, into, a, single, mathematical, framework, however, many, approaches, to, quantum, gravity, such, as, string, theory, try, to, develop, a, framework, that, describes, all, fundamental, forces, such, a, theory, is, often, referred, to, as, a, theory, of, everything, some, of, the, approaches, such, as, loop, quantum, gravity, make, no, such, attempt, instead, they, make, an, effort, to, quantize, the, gravitational, field, while, it, is, kept, separate, from, the, other, forces, other, lesser, known, but, no, less, important, theories, include, causal, dynamical, triangulation, noncommutative, geometry, and, twistor, theory, one, of, the, difficulties, of, formulating, a, quantum, gravity, theory, is, that, direct, observation, of, quantum, gravitational, effects, is, thought, to, only, appear, at, length, scales, near, the, planck, scale, around, 10, 35, meters, a, scale, far, smaller, and, hence, only, accessible, with, far, higher, energies, than, those, currently, available, in, high, energy, particle, accelerators, therefore, physicists, lack, experimental, data, which, could, distinguish, between, the, competing, theories, which, have, been, proposed, thought, experiment, approaches, have, been, suggested, as, a, testing, tool, for, quantum, gravity, theories, in, the, field, of, quantum, gravity, there, are, several, open, questions, e, g, it, is, not, known, how, spin, of, elementary, particles, sources, gravity, and, thought, experiments, could, provide, a, pathway, to, explore, possible, resolutions, to, these, questions, even, in, the, absence, of, lab, experiments, or, physical, observations, in, the, early, 21st, century, new, experiment, designs, and, technologies, have, arisen, which, suggest, that, indirect, approaches, to, testing, quantum, gravity, may, be, feasible, over, the, next, few, decades, this, field, of, study, is, called, phenomenological, quantum, gravity, much, of, the, difficulty, in, meshing, these, theories, at, all, energy, scales, comes, from, the, different, assumptions, that, these, theories, make, on, how, the, universe, works, general, relativity, models, gravity, as, curvature, of, spacetime, in, the, slogan, of, john, archibald, wheeler, spacetime, tells, matter, how, to, move, matter, tells, spacetime, how, to, curve, on, the, other, hand, quantum, field, theory, is, typically, formulated, in, the, flat, spacetime, used, in, special, relativity, no, theory, has, yet, proven, successful, in, describing, the, general, situation, where, the, dynamics, of, matter, modeled, with, quantum, mechanics, affect, the, curvature, of, spacetime, if, one, attempts, to, treat, gravity, as, simply, another, quantum, field, the, resulting, theory, is, not, renormalizable, even, in, the, simpler, case, where, the, curvature, of, spacetime, is, fixed, a, priori, developing, quantum, field, theory, becomes, more, mathematically, challenging, and, many, ideas, physicists, use, in, quantum, field, theory, on, flat, spacetime, are, no, longer, applicable, it, is, widely, hoped, that, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, would, allow, us, to, understand, problems, of, very, high, energy, and, very, small, dimensions, of, space, such, as, the, behavior, of, black, holes, and, the, origin, of, the, universe, one, major, obstacle, is, that, for, quantum, field, theory, in, curved, spacetime, with, a, fixed, metric, bosonic, fermionic, operator, fields, supercommute, for, spacelike, separated, points, this, is, a, way, of, imposing, a, principle, of, locality, however, in, quantum, gravity, the, metric, is, dynamical, so, that, whether, two, points, are, spacelike, separated, depends, on, the, state, in, fact, they, can, be, in, a, quantum, superposition, of, being, spacelike, and, not, spacelike, separated, the, observation, that, all, fundamental, forces, except, gravity, have, one, or, more, known, messenger, particles, leads, researchers, to, believe, that, at, least, one, must, exist, for, gravity, this, hypothetical, particle, is, known, as, the, graviton, these, particles, act, as, a, force, particle, similar, to, the, photon, of, the, electromagnetic, interaction, under, mild, assumptions, the, structure, of, general, relativity, requires, them, to, follow, the, quantum, mechanical, description, of, interacting, theoretical, spin, 2, massless, particles, many, of, the, accepted, notions, of, a, unified, theory, of, physics, since, the, 1970s, assume, and, to, some, degree, depend, upon, the, existence, of, the, graviton, the, weinberg, witten, theorem, places, some, constraints, on, theories, in, which, the, graviton, is, a, composite, particle, while, gravitons, are, an, important, theoretical, step, in, a, quantum, mechanical, description, of, gravity, they, are, generally, believed, to, be, undetectable, because, they, interact, too, weakly, general, relativity, like, electromagnetism, is, a, classical, field, theory, one, might, expect, that, as, with, electromagnetism, the, gravitational, force, should, also, have, a, corresponding, quantum, field, theory, however, gravity, is, perturbatively, nonrenormalizable, for, a, quantum, field, theory, to, be, well, defined, according, to, this, understanding, of, the, subject, it, must, be, asymptotically, free, or, asymptotically, safe, the, theory, must, be, characterized, by, a, choice, of, finitely, many, parameters, which, could, in, principle, be, set, by, experiment, for, example, in, quantum, electrodynamics, these, parameters, are, the, charge, and, mass, of, the, electron, as, measured, at, a, particular, energy, scale, on, the, other, hand, in, quantizing, gravity, there, are, in, perturbation, theory, infinitely, many, independent, parameters, counterterm, coefficients, needed, to, define, the, theory, for, a, given, choice, of, those, parameters, one, could, make, sense, of, the, theory, but, since, it, is, impossible, to, conduct, infinite, experiments, to, fix, the, values, of, every, parameter, it, has, been, argued, that, one, does, not, in, perturbation, theory, have, a, meaningful, physical, theory, at, low, energies, the, logic, of, the, renormalization, group, tells, us, that, despite, the, unknown, choices, of, these, infinitely, many, parameters, quantum, gravity, will, reduce, to, the, usual, einstein, theory, of, general, relativity, on, the, other, hand, if, we, could, probe, very, high, energies, where, quantum, effects, take, over, then, every, one, of, the, infinitely, many, unknown, parameters, would, begin, to, matter, and, we, could, make, no, predictions, at, all, it, is, conceivable, that, in, the, correct, theory, of, quantum, gravity, the, infinitely, many, unknown, parameters, will, reduce, to, a, finite, number, that, can, then, be, measured, one, possibility, is, that, normal, perturbation, theory, is, not, a, reliable, guide, to, the, renormalizability, of, the, theory, and, that, there, really, is, a, uv, fixed, point, for, gravity, since, this, is, a, question, of, non, perturbative, quantum, field, theory, finding, a, reliable, answer, is, difficult, pursued, in, the, asymptotic, safety, program, another, possibility, is, that, there, are, new, undiscovered, symmetry, principles, that, constrain, the, parameters, and, reduce, them, to, a, finite, set, this, is, the, route, taken, by, string, theory, where, all, of, the, excitations, of, the, string, essentially, manifest, themselves, as, new, symmetries, in, an, effective, field, theory, not, all, but, the, first, few, of, the, infinite, set, of, parameters, in, a, nonrenormalizable, theory, are, suppressed, by, huge, energy, scales, and, hence, can, be, neglected, when, computing, low, energy, effects, thus, at, least, in, the, low, energy, regime, the, model, is, a, predictive, quantum, field, theory, furthermore, many, theorists, argue, that, the, standard, model, should, be, regarded, as, an, effective, field, theory, itself, with, nonrenormalizable, interactions, suppressed, by, large, energy, scales, and, whose, effects, have, consequently, not, been, observed, experimentally, by, treating, general, relativity, as, an, effective, field, theory, one, can, actually, make, legitimate, predictions, for, quantum, gravity, at, least, for, low, energy, phenomena, an, example, is, the, well, known, calculation, of, the, tiny, first, order, quantum, mechanical, correction, to, the, classical, newtonian, gravitational, potential, between, two, masses, a, fundamental, lesson, of, general, relativity, is, that, there, is, no, fixed, spacetime, background, as, found, in, newtonian, mechanics, and, special, relativity, the, spacetime, geometry, is, dynamic, while, simple, to, grasp, in, principle, this, is, a, complex, idea, to, understand, about, general, relativity, and, its, consequences, are, profound, and, not, fully, explored, even, at, the, classical, level, to, a, certain, extent, general, relativity, can, be, seen, to, be, a, relational, theory, in, which, the, only, physically, relevant, information, is, the, relationship, between, different, events, in, spacetime, on, the, other, hand, quantum, mechanics, has, depended, since, its, inception, on, a, fixed, background, non, dynamic, structure, in, the, case, of, quantum, mechanics, it, is, time, that, is, given, and, not, dynamic, just, as, in, newtonian, classical, mechanics, in, relativistic, quantum, field, theory, just, as, in, classical, field, theory, minkowski, spacetime, is, the, fixed, background, of, the, theory, string, theory, can, be, seen, as, a, generalization, of, quantum, field, theory, where, instead, of, point, particles, string, like, objects, propagate, in, a, fixed, spacetime, background, although, the, interactions, among, closed, strings, give, rise, to, space, time, in, a, dynamic, way, although, string, theory, had, its, origins, in, the, study, of, quark, confinement, and, not, of, quantum, gravity, it, was, soon, discovered, that, the, string, spectrum, contains, the, graviton, and, that, condensation, of, certain, vibration, modes, of, strings, is, equivalent, to, a, modification, of, the, original, background, in, this, sense, string, perturbation, theory, exhibits, exactly, the, features, one, would, expect, of, a, perturbation, theory, that, may, exhibit, a, strong, dependence, on, asymptotics, as, seen, for, example, in, the, ads, cft, correspondence, which, is, a, weak, form, of, background, dependence, loop, quantum, gravity, is, the, fruit, of, an, effort, to, formulate, a, background, independent, quantum, theory, topological, quantum, field, theory, provided, an, example, of, background, independent, quantum, theory, but, with, no, local, degrees, of, freedom, and, only, finitely, many, degrees, of, freedom, globally, this, is, inadequate, to, describe, gravity, in, 3, 1, dimensions, which, has, local, degrees, of, freedom, according, to, general, relativity, in, 2, 1, dimensions, however, gravity, is, a, topological, field, theory, and, it, has, been, successfully, quantized, in, several, different, ways, including, spin, networks, quantum, field, theory, on, curved, non, minkowskian, backgrounds, while, not, a, full, quantum, theory, of, gravity, has, shown, many, promising, early, results, in, an, analogous, way, to, the, development, of, quantum, electrodynamics, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, when, physicists, considered, quantum, mechanics, in, classical, electromagnetic, fields, the, consideration, of, quantum, field, theory, on, a, curved, background, has, led, to, predictions, such, as, black, hole, radiation, phenomena, such, as, the, unruh, effect, in, which, particles, exist, in, certain, accelerating, frames, but, not, in, stationary, ones, do, not, pose, any, difficulty, when, considered, on, a, curved, background, the, unruh, effect, occurs, even, in, flat, minkowskian, backgrounds, the, vacuum, state, is, the, state, with, the, least, energy, and, may, or, may, not, contain, particles, a, conceptual, difficulty, in, combining, quantum, mechanics, with, general, relativity, arises, from, the, contrasting, role, of, time, within, these, two, frameworks, in, quantum, theories, time, acts, as, an, independent, background, through, which, states, evolve, with, the, hamiltonian, operator, acting, as, the, generator, of, infinitesimal, translations, of, quantum, states, through, time, in, contrast, general, relativity, treats, time, as, a, dynamical, variable, which, relates, directly, with, matter, and, moreover, requires, the, hamiltonian, constraint, to, vanish, because, this, variability, of, time, has, been, observed, macroscopically, it, removes, any, possibility, of, employing, a, fixed, notion, of, time, similar, to, the, conception, of, time, in, quantum, theory, at, the, macroscopic, level, there, are, a, number, of, proposed, quantum, gravity, theories, currently, there, is, still, no, complete, and, consistent, quantum, theory, of, gravity, and, the, candidate, models, still, need, to, overcome, major, formal, and, conceptual, problems, they, also, face, the, common, problem, that, as, yet, there, is, no, way, to, put, quantum, gravity, predictions, to, experimental, tests, although, there, is, hope, for, this, to, change, as, future, data, from, cosmological, observations, and, particle, physics, experiments, become, available, the, central, idea, of, string, theory, is, to, replace, the, classical, concept, of, a, point, particle, in, quantum, field, theory, with, a, quantum, theory, of, one, dimensional, extended, objects, string, theory, at, the, energies, reached, in, current, experiments, these, strings, are, indistinguishable, from, point, like, particles, but, crucially, different, modes, of, oscillation, of, one, and, the, same, type, of, fundamental, string, appear, as, particles, with, different, electric, and, other, charges, in, this, way, string, theory, promises, to, be, a, unified, description, of, all, particles, and, interactions, the, theory, is, successful, in, that, one, mode, will, always, correspond, to, a, graviton, the, messenger, particle, of, gravity, however, the, price, of, this, success, is, unusual, features, such, as, six, extra, dimensions, of, space, in, addition, to, the, usual, three, for, space, and, one, for, time, in, what, is, called, the, second, superstring, revolution, it, was, conjectured, that, both, string, theory, and, a, unification, of, general, relativity, and, supersymmetry, known, as, supergravity, form, part, of, a, hypothesized, eleven, dimensional, model, known, as, m, theory, which, would, constitute, a, uniquely, defined, and, consistent, theory, of, quantum, gravity, as, presently, understood, however, string, theory, admits, a, very, large, number, 10, 500, by, some, estimates, of, consistent, vacua, comprising, the, so, called, string, landscape, sorting, through, this, large, family, of, solutions, remains, a, major, challenge, loop, quantum, gravity, seriously, considers, general, relativity, s, insight, that, spacetime, is, a, dynamical, field, and, is, therefore, a, quantum, object, its, second, idea, is, that, the, quantum, discreteness, that, determines, the, particle, like, behavior, of, other, field, theories, for, instance, the, photons, of, the, electromagnetic, field, also, affects, the, structure, of, space, the, main, result, of, loop, quantum, gravity, is, the, derivation, of, a, granular, structure, of, space, at, the, planck, length, this, is, derived, from, the, following, considerations, in, the, case, of, electromagnetism, the, quantum, operator, representing, the, energy, of, each, frequency, of, the, field, has, a, discrete, spectrum, thus, the, energy, of, each, frequency, is, quantized, and, the, quanta, are, the, photons, in, the, case, of, gravity, the, operators, representing, the, area, and, the, volume, of, each, surface, or, space, region, likewise, have, discrete, spectra, thus, area, and, volume, of, any, portion, of, space, are, also, quantized, where, the, quanta, are, elementary, quanta, of, space, it, follows, then, that, spacetime, has, an, elementary, quantum, granular, structure, at, the, planck, scale, which, cuts, off, the, ultraviolet, infinities, of, quantum, field, theory, the, quantum, state, of, spacetime, is, described, in, the, theory, by, means, of, a, mathematical, structure, called, spin, networks, spin, networks, were, initially, introduced, by, roger, penrose, in, abstract, form, and, later, shown, by, carlo, rovelli, and, lee, smolin, to, derive, naturally, from, a, non, perturbative, quantization, of, general, relativity, spin, networks, do, not, represent, quantum, states, of, a, field, in, spacetime, they, represent, directly, quantum, states, of, spacetime, the, theory, is, based, on, the, reformulation, of, general, relativity, known, as, ashtekar, variables, which, represent, geometric, gravity, using, mathematical, analogues, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, the, quantum, theory, space, is, represented, by, a, network, structure, called, a, spin, network, evolving, over, time, in, discrete, steps, the, dynamics, of, the, theory, is, today, constructed, in, several, versions, one, version, starts, with, the, canonical, quantization, of, general, relativity, the, analogue, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, a, wheeler, dewitt, equation, which, can, be, defined, within, the, theory, in, the, covariant, or, spinfoam, formulation, of, the, theory, the, quantum, dynamics, is, obtained, via, a, sum, over, discrete, versions, of, spacetime, called, spinfoams, these, represent, histories, of, spin, networks, there, are, a, number, of, other, approaches, to, quantum, gravity, the, theories, differ, depending, on, which, features, of, general, relativity, and, quantum, theory, are, accepted, unchanged, and, which, features, are, modified, examples, include, as, was, emphasized, above, quantum, gravitational, effects, are, extremely, weak, and, therefore, difficult, to, test, for, this, reason, the, possibility, of, experimentally, testing, quantum, gravity, had, not, received, much, attention, prior, to, the, late, 1990s, however, in, the, past, decade, physicists, have, realized, that, evidence, for, quantum, gravitational, effects, can, guide, the, development, of, the, theory, since, theoretical, development, has, been, slow, the, field, of, phenomenological, quantum, gravity, which, studies, the, possibility, of, experimental, tests, has, obtained, increased, attention, the, most, widely, pursued, possibilities, for, quantum, gravity, phenomenology, include, gravitationally, mediated, entanglement, violations, of, lorentz, invariance, imprints, of, quantum, gravitational, effects, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, in, particular, its, polarization, and, decoherence, induced, by, fluctuations, in, the, space, time, foam, the, latter, scenario, has, been, searched, for, in, light, from, gamma, ray, bursts, and, both, astrophysical, and, atmospheric, neutrinos, placing, limits, on, phenomenological, quantum, gravity, parameters, esa, s, integral, satellite, measured, polarization, of, photons, of, different, wavelengths, and, was, able, to, place, a, limit, in, the, granularity, of, space, that, is, less, than, 10, 48, m, or, 13, orders, of, magnitude, below, the, planck, scale, the, bicep2, experiment, detected, what, was, initially, thought, to, be, primordial, b, mode, polarization, caused, by, gravitational, waves, in, the, early, universe, had, the, signal, in, fact, been, primordial, in, origin, it, could, have, been, an, indication, of, quantum, gravitational, effects, but, it, soon, transpired, that, the, polarization, was, due, to, interstellar, dust, interference
