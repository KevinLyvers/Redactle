3c, 273, is, a, quasar, located, at, the, center, of, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, in, the, constellation, of, virgo, it, was, the, first, quasar, ever, to, be, identified, and, is, the, visually, brightest, quasar, in, the, sky, as, seen, from, earth, with, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, of, 12, 9, the, derived, distance, to, this, object, is, 749, megaparsecs, 2, 4, billion, light, years, the, mass, of, its, central, supermassive, black, hole, is, approximately, 886, million, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, 3c, 273, is, visible, from, march, to, july, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, situated, in, the, virgo, constellation, it, is, bright, enough, to, be, observed, by, eye, with, a, 6, inch, 150, mm, amateur, telescope, due, in, part, to, its, radio, luminosity, and, its, discovery, as, the, first, identified, quasar, 3c, 273, s, right, ascension, in, the, fifth, fundamental, catalog, fk5, is, used, to, standardize, the, positions, of, 23, extragalactic, radio, sources, used, to, define, the, international, celestial, reference, system, icrs, given, its, distance, from, earth, and, visual, magnitude, 3c, 273, is, the, most, distant, celestial, object, average, amateur, astronomers, are, likely, to, see, through, their, telescopes, this, is, the, optically, brightest, quasar, in, the, sky, from, earth, with, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, of, 12, 9, and, one, of, the, closest, with, a, redshift, z, of, 0, 158, a, luminosity, distance, of, d, l, 749, megaparsecs, 2, 4, billion, light, years, may, be, calculated, from, z, using, parallax, methods, with, the, very, large, telescope, interferometer, yields, a, distance, estimate, of, 1, 80, 0, 32, 0, 28, gly, 552, 97, 79, mpc, it, is, one, of, the, most, luminous, quasars, known, with, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 26, 7, meaning, that, if, it, were, only, as, distant, as, pollux, 10, parsecs, it, would, appear, nearly, as, bright, in, the, sky, as, the, sun, since, the, sun, s, absolute, magnitude, is, 4, 83, it, means, that, the, quasar, is, over, 4, trillion, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, at, visible, wavelengths, the, luminosity, of, 3c, 273, is, variable, at, nearly, every, wavelength, from, radio, waves, to, gamma, rays, on, timescales, of, a, few, days, to, decades, polarization, with, coincident, orientation, has, been, observed, with, radio, infrared, and, optical, light, being, emitted, from, a, large, scale, jet, these, emissions, are, therefore, almost, certainly, synchrotron, in, nature, the, radiation, is, created, by, a, jet, of, charged, particles, moving, at, relativistic, speeds, vlbi, radio, observations, of, 3c, 273, have, revealed, proper, motion, of, some, of, the, radio, emitting, regions, further, suggesting, the, presence, of, relativistic, jets, of, material, this, is, a, prototype, of, an, active, galactic, nucleus, demonstrating, that, the, energy, is, being, produced, through, accretion, by, a, supermassive, black, hole, smbh, no, other, astrophysical, source, can, produce, the, observed, energy, the, mass, of, its, central, smbh, has, been, measured, to, be, 886, 187, million, solar, masses, through, broad, emission, line, reverberation, mapping, the, quasar, has, a, large, scale, visible, jet, which, measures, 200, 000, light, years, 61, kpc, long, having, an, apparent, size, of, 23, such, jets, are, believed, to, be, created, by, the, interaction, of, the, central, black, hole, and, the, accretion, disk, in, 1995, optical, imaging, of, the, jet, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, revealed, a, structured, morphology, evidenced, by, repeated, bright, knots, interlaced, by, areas, of, weak, emission, the, viewing, angle, of, the, jet, is, about, 6, as, seen, from, earth, the, jet, was, observed, to, abruptly, change, direction, by, an, intrinsic, angle, of, 2, in, 2003, which, is, larger, than, the, jet, s, intrinsic, opening, angle, of, 1, 1, an, expanding, cocoon, of, heated, gas, is, being, generated, by, the, jet, which, may, be, impacting, an, inclined, disk, of, gas, within, the, central, 6, kpc, 3c, 273, lies, at, the, center, of, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 16, and, an, apparent, size, of, 29, arcseconds, the, morphological, classification, of, the, host, galaxy, is, e4, indicating, a, moderately, flattened, elliptical, shape, the, galaxy, has, an, estimated, mass, of, 2, 10, 11, m, the, name, signifies, that, it, was, the, 273rd, object, ordered, by, right, ascension, of, the, third, cambridge, catalog, of, radio, sources, 3c, published, in, 1959, after, accurate, positions, were, obtained, using, lunar, occultation, by, cyril, hazard, at, the, parkes, radio, telescope, the, radio, source, was, quickly, associated, with, an, optical, counterpart, an, unresolved, stellar, object, in, 1963, maarten, schmidt, and, bev, oke, published, a, pair, of, papers, in, nature, reporting, that, 3c, 273, has, a, substantial, redshift, of, 0, 158, placing, it, several, billion, light, years, away, prior, to, the, discovery, of, 3c, 273, several, other, radio, sources, had, been, associated, with, optical, counterparts, the, first, being, 3c, 48, also, many, active, galaxies, had, been, misidentified, as, variable, stars, including, the, famous, bl, lac, w, com, and, au, cvn, however, it, was, not, understood, what, these, objects, were, since, their, spectra, were, unlike, those, of, any, known, stars, its, spectrum, did, not, resemble, that, of, any, normal, stars, with, typical, stellar, elements, 3c, 273, was, the, first, object, to, be, identified, as, a, quasar, an, extremely, luminous, object, at, an, astronomical, distance, 3c, 273, is, a, radio, loud, quasar, and, was, also, one, of, the, first, extragalactic, x, ray, sources, discovered, in, 1970, however, even, to, this, day, the, process, which, gives, rise, to, the, x, ray, emissions, is, controversial
