lava, is, molten, or, partially, molten, rock, magma, that, has, been, expelled, from, the, interior, of, a, terrestrial, planet, such, as, earth, or, a, moon, onto, its, surface, lava, may, be, erupted, at, a, volcano, or, through, a, fracture, in, the, crust, on, land, or, underwater, usually, at, temperatures, from, 800, to, 1, 200, c, 1, 470, to, 2, 190, f, the, volcanic, rock, resulting, from, subsequent, cooling, is, also, often, called, lava, a, lava, flow, is, an, outpouring, of, lava, during, an, effusive, eruption, an, explosive, eruption, by, contrast, produces, a, mixture, of, volcanic, ash, and, other, fragments, called, tephra, not, lava, flows, the, viscosity, of, most, lava, is, about, that, of, ketchup, roughly, 10, 000, to, 100, 000, times, that, of, water, even, so, lava, can, flow, great, distances, before, cooling, causes, it, to, solidify, because, lava, exposed, to, air, quickly, develops, a, solid, crust, that, insulates, the, remaining, liquid, lava, helping, to, keep, it, hot, and, inviscid, enough, to, continue, flowing, the, word, lava, comes, from, italian, and, is, probably, derived, from, the, latin, word, labes, which, means, a, fall, or, slide, an, early, use, of, the, word, in, connection, with, extrusion, of, magma, from, below, the, surface, is, found, in, a, short, account, of, the, 1737, eruption, of, vesuvius, written, by, francesco, serao, who, described, a, flow, of, fiery, lava, as, an, analogy, to, the, flow, of, water, and, mud, down, the, flanks, of, the, volcano, a, lahar, after, heavy, rain, solidified, lava, on, the, earth, s, crust, is, predominantly, silicate, minerals, mostly, feldspars, feldspathoids, olivine, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, and, quartz, rare, nonsilicate, lavas, can, be, formed, by, local, melting, of, nonsilicate, mineral, deposits, or, by, separation, of, a, magma, into, immiscible, silicate, and, nonsilicate, liquid, phases, silicate, lavas, are, molten, mixtures, dominated, by, oxygen, and, silicon, the, most, abundant, elements, of, the, earth, s, crust, with, smaller, quantities, of, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, iron, sodium, and, potassium, and, minor, amounts, of, many, other, elements, petrologists, routinely, express, the, composition, of, a, silicate, lava, in, terms, of, the, weight, or, molar, mass, fraction, of, the, oxides, of, the, major, elements, other, than, oxygen, present, in, the, lava, the, silica, component, dominates, the, physical, behavior, of, silicate, magmas, silicon, ions, in, lava, strongly, bind, to, four, oxygen, ions, in, a, tetrahedral, arrangement, if, an, oxygen, ion, is, bound, to, two, silicon, ions, in, the, melt, it, is, described, as, a, bridging, oxygen, and, lava, with, many, clumps, or, chains, of, silicon, ions, connected, by, bridging, oxygen, ions, is, described, as, partially, polymerized, aluminium, in, combination, with, alkali, metal, oxides, sodium, and, potassium, also, tends, to, polymerize, the, lava, other, cations, such, as, ferrous, iron, calcium, and, magnesium, bond, much, more, weakly, to, oxygen, and, reduce, the, tendency, to, polymerize, partial, polymerization, makes, the, lava, viscous, so, lava, high, in, silica, is, much, more, viscous, than, lava, low, in, silica, because, of, the, role, of, silica, in, determining, viscosity, and, because, many, other, properties, of, a, lava, such, as, its, temperature, are, observed, to, correlate, with, silica, content, silicate, lavas, are, divided, into, four, chemical, types, based, on, silica, content, felsic, intermediate, mafic, and, ultramafic, felsic, or, silicic, lavas, have, a, silica, content, greater, than, 63, they, include, rhyolite, and, dacite, lavas, with, such, a, high, silica, content, these, lavas, are, extremely, viscous, ranging, from, 10, 8, cp, 10, 5, pa, s, for, hot, rhyolite, lava, at, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, to, 10, 11, cp, 10, 8, pa, s, for, cool, rhyolite, lava, at, 800, c, 1, 470, f, for, comparison, water, has, a, viscosity, of, about, 1, cp, 0, 001, pa, s, because, of, this, very, high, viscosity, felsic, lavas, usually, erupt, explosively, to, produce, pyroclastic, fragmental, deposits, however, rhyolite, lavas, occasionally, erupt, effusively, to, form, lava, spines, lava, domes, or, coulees, which, are, thick, short, lava, flows, the, lavas, typically, fragment, as, they, extrude, producing, block, lava, flows, these, often, contain, obsidian, felsic, magmas, can, erupt, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 800, c, 1, 470, f, unusually, hot, 950, c, 1, 740, f, rhyolite, lavas, however, may, flow, for, distances, of, many, tens, of, kilometres, such, as, in, the, snake, river, plain, of, the, northwestern, united, states, intermediate, or, andesitic, lavas, contain, 52, to, 63, silica, and, are, lower, in, aluminium, and, usually, somewhat, richer, in, magnesium, and, iron, than, felsic, lavas, intermediate, lavas, form, andesite, domes, and, block, lavas, and, may, occur, on, steep, composite, volcanoes, such, as, in, the, andes, they, are, also, commonly, hotter, than, felsic, lavas, in, the, range, of, 850, to, 1, 100, c, 1, 560, to, 2, 010, f, because, of, their, lower, silica, content, and, higher, eruptive, temperatures, they, tend, to, be, much, less, viscous, with, a, typical, viscosity, of, 3, 5, 10, 6, cp, 3, 500, pa, s, at, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, this, is, slightly, greater, than, the, viscosity, of, smooth, peanut, butter, intermediate, lavas, show, a, greater, tendency, to, form, phenocrysts, higher, iron, and, magnesium, tends, to, manifest, as, a, darker, groundmass, including, amphibole, or, pyroxene, phenocrysts, mafic, or, basaltic, lavas, are, typified, by, relatively, high, magnesium, oxide, and, iron, oxide, content, whose, molecular, formulas, provide, the, consonants, in, mafic, and, have, a, silica, content, limited, to, a, range, of, 52, to, 45, they, generally, erupt, at, temperatures, of, 1, 100, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 010, to, 2, 190, f, and, at, relatively, low, viscosities, around, 10, 4, to, 10, 5, cp, 10, to, 100, pa, s, this, is, similar, to, the, viscosity, of, ketchup, although, it, is, still, many, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, that, of, water, mafic, lavas, tend, to, produce, low, profile, shield, volcanoes, or, flood, basalts, because, the, less, viscous, lava, can, flow, for, long, distances, from, the, vent, the, thickness, of, a, solidified, basaltic, lava, flow, particularly, on, a, low, slope, may, be, much, greater, than, the, thickness, of, the, moving, molten, lava, flow, at, any, one, time, because, basaltic, lavas, may, inflate, by, a, continued, supply, of, lava, and, its, pressure, on, a, solidified, crust, most, basaltic, lavas, are, of, a, or, p, hoehoe, types, rather, than, block, lavas, underwater, they, can, form, pillow, lavas, which, are, rather, similar, to, entrail, type, pahoehoe, lavas, on, land, ultramafic, lavas, such, as, komatiite, and, highly, magnesian, magmas, that, form, boninite, take, the, composition, and, temperatures, of, eruptions, to, the, extreme, all, have, a, silica, content, under, 45, komatiites, contain, over, 18, magnesium, oxide, and, are, thought, to, have, erupted, at, temperatures, of, 1, 600, c, 2, 910, f, at, this, temperature, there, is, practically, no, polymerization, of, the, mineral, compounds, creating, a, highly, mobile, liquid, viscosities, of, komatiite, magmas, are, thought, to, have, been, as, low, as, 100, to, 1000, cp, 0, 1, to, 1, pa, s, similar, to, that, of, light, motor, oil, most, ultramafic, lavas, are, no, younger, than, the, proterozoic, with, a, few, ultramafic, magmas, known, from, the, phanerozoic, in, central, america, that, are, attributed, to, a, hot, mantle, plume, no, modern, komatiite, lavas, are, known, as, the, earth, s, mantle, has, cooled, too, much, to, produce, highly, magnesian, magmas, some, silicate, lavas, have, an, elevated, content, of, alkali, metal, oxides, sodium, and, potassium, particularly, in, regions, of, continental, rifting, areas, overlying, deeply, subducted, plates, or, at, intraplate, hotspots, their, silica, content, can, range, from, ultramafic, nephelinites, basanites, and, tephrites, to, felsic, trachytes, they, are, more, likely, to, be, generated, at, greater, depths, in, the, mantle, than, subalkaline, magmas, olivine, nephelinite, lavas, are, both, ultramafic, and, highly, alkaline, and, are, thought, to, have, come, from, much, deeper, in, the, mantle, of, the, earth, than, other, lavas, tholeiitic, basalt, lava, rhyolite, lava, some, lavas, of, unusual, composition, have, erupted, onto, the, surface, of, the, earth, these, include, the, term, lava, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, molten, ice, mixtures, in, eruptions, on, the, icy, satellites, of, the, solar, system, s, giant, planets, the, lava, s, viscosity, mostly, determines, the, behavior, of, lava, flows, while, the, temperature, of, common, silicate, lava, ranges, from, about, 800, c, 1, 470, f, for, felsic, lavas, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, for, mafic, lavas, its, viscosity, ranges, over, seven, orders, of, magnitude, from, 10, 11, cp, 10, 8, pa, s, for, felsic, lavas, to, 10, 4, cp, 10, pa, s, for, mafic, lavas, lava, viscosity, is, mostly, determined, by, composition, but, also, depends, on, temperature, and, shear, rate, lava, viscosity, determines, the, kind, of, volcanic, activity, that, takes, place, when, the, lava, is, erupted, the, greater, the, viscosity, the, greater, the, tendency, for, eruptions, to, be, explosive, rather, than, effusive, as, a, result, most, lava, flows, on, earth, mars, and, venus, are, composed, of, basalt, lava, on, earth, 90, of, lava, flows, are, mafic, or, ultramafic, with, intermediate, lava, making, up, 8, of, flows, and, felsic, lava, making, up, just, 2, of, flows, viscosity, also, determines, the, aspect, thickness, relative, to, lateral, extent, of, flows, the, speed, with, which, flows, move, and, the, surface, character, of, the, flows, when, highly, viscous, lavas, erupt, effusively, rather, than, in, their, more, common, explosive, form, they, almost, always, erupt, as, high, aspect, flows, or, domes, these, flows, take, the, form, of, block, lava, rather, than, a, or, p, hoehoe, obsidian, flows, are, common, intermediate, lavas, tend, to, form, steep, stratovolcanoes, with, alternating, beds, of, lava, from, effusive, eruptions, and, tephra, from, explosive, eruptions, mafic, lavas, form, relatively, thin, flows, that, can, move, great, distances, forming, shield, volcanoes, with, gentle, slopes, in, addition, to, melted, rock, most, lavas, contain, solid, crystals, of, various, minerals, fragments, of, exotic, rocks, known, as, xenoliths, and, fragments, of, previously, solidified, lava, the, crystal, content, of, most, lavas, gives, them, thixotropic, and, shear, thinning, properties, in, other, words, most, lavas, do, not, behave, like, newtonian, fluids, in, which, the, rate, of, flow, is, proportional, to, the, shear, stress, instead, a, typical, lava, is, a, bingham, fluid, which, shows, considerable, resistance, to, flow, until, a, stress, threshold, called, the, yield, stress, is, crossed, this, results, in, plug, flow, of, partially, crystalline, lava, a, familiar, example, of, plug, flow, is, toothpaste, squeezed, out, of, a, toothpaste, tube, the, toothpaste, comes, out, as, a, semisolid, plug, because, shear, is, concentrated, in, a, thin, layer, in, the, toothpaste, next, to, the, tube, and, only, there, does, the, toothpaste, behave, as, a, fluid, thixotropic, behavior, also, hinders, crystals, from, settling, out, of, the, lava, once, the, crystal, content, reaches, about, 60, the, lava, ceases, to, behave, like, a, fluid, and, begins, to, behave, like, a, solid, such, a, mixture, of, crystals, with, melted, rock, is, sometimes, described, as, crystal, mush, lava, flow, speeds, vary, based, primarily, on, viscosity, and, slope, in, general, lava, flows, slowly, with, typical, speeds, for, hawaiian, basaltic, flows, of, 0, 40, km, h, 0, 25, mph, and, maximum, speeds, of, 10, to, 48, km, h, 6, to, 30, mph, on, steep, slopes, an, exceptional, speed, of, 32, to, 97, km, h, 20, to, 60, mph, was, recorded, following, the, collapse, of, a, lava, lake, at, mount, nyiragongo, the, scaling, relationship, for, lavas, is, that, the, average, speed, of, a, flow, scales, as, the, square, of, its, thickness, divided, by, its, viscosity, this, implies, that, a, rhyolite, flow, would, have, to, be, about, a, thousand, times, thicker, than, a, basalt, flow, to, flow, at, a, similar, speed, the, temperature, of, most, types, of, molten, lava, ranges, from, about, 800, c, 1, 470, f, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, depending, on, the, lava, s, chemical, composition, this, temperature, range, is, similar, to, the, hottest, temperatures, achievable, with, a, forced, air, charcoal, forge, lava, is, most, fluid, when, first, erupted, becoming, much, more, viscous, as, its, temperature, drops, lava, flows, quickly, develop, an, insulating, crust, of, solid, rock, as, a, result, of, radiative, loss, of, heat, thereafter, the, lava, cools, by, a, very, slow, conduction, of, heat, through, the, rocky, crust, for, instance, geologists, of, the, united, states, geological, survey, regularly, drilled, into, the, kilauea, iki, lava, lake, formed, in, an, eruption, in, 1959, after, three, years, the, solid, surface, crust, whose, base, was, at, a, temperature, of, 1, 065, c, 1, 949, f, was, still, only, 14, m, 46, ft, thick, even, though, the, lake, was, about, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, residual, liquid, was, still, present, at, depths, of, around, 80, m, 260, ft, nineteen, years, after, the, eruption, a, cooling, lava, flow, shrinks, and, this, fractures, the, flow, basalt, flows, show, a, characteristic, pattern, of, fractures, the, uppermost, parts, of, the, flow, show, irregular, downward, splaying, fractures, while, the, lower, part, of, the, flow, shows, a, very, regular, pattern, of, fractures, that, break, the, flow, into, five, or, six, sided, columns, the, irregular, upper, part, of, the, solidified, flow, is, called, the, entablature, while, the, lower, part, that, shows, columnar, jointing, is, called, the, colonnade, the, terms, are, borrowed, from, greek, temple, architecture, likewise, regular, vertical, patterns, on, the, sides, of, columns, produced, by, cooling, with, periodic, fracturing, are, described, as, chisel, marks, despite, their, names, these, are, natural, features, produced, by, cooling, thermal, contraction, and, fracturing, as, lava, cools, crystallizing, inwards, from, its, edges, it, expels, gases, to, form, vesicles, at, the, lower, and, upper, boundaries, these, are, described, as, pipe, stem, vesicles, or, pipe, stem, amygdales, liquids, expelled, from, the, cooling, crystal, mush, rise, upwards, into, the, still, fluid, center, of, the, cooling, flow, and, produce, vertical, vesicle, cylinders, where, these, merge, towards, the, top, of, the, flow, they, form, sheets, of, vesicular, basalt, and, are, sometimes, capped, with, gas, cavities, that, sometimes, fill, with, secondary, minerals, the, beautiful, amethyst, geodes, found, in, the, flood, basalts, of, south, america, formed, in, this, manner, flood, basalts, typically, crystallize, little, before, they, cease, flowing, and, as, a, result, flow, textures, are, uncommon, in, less, silicic, flows, on, the, other, hand, flow, banding, is, common, in, felsic, flows, the, morphology, of, lava, describes, its, surface, form, or, texture, more, fluid, basaltic, lava, flows, tend, to, form, flat, sheet, like, bodies, whereas, viscous, rhyolite, lava, flows, form, knobbly, blocky, masses, of, rock, lava, erupted, underwater, has, its, own, distinctive, characteristics, a, also, spelled, aa, a, a, a, a, and, a, aa, and, pronounced, or, is, one, of, three, basic, types, of, flow, lava, a, is, basaltic, lava, characterized, by, a, rough, or, rubbly, surface, composed, of, broken, lava, blocks, called, clinker, the, word, is, hawaiian, meaning, stony, rough, lava, but, also, to, burn, or, blaze, it, was, introduced, as, a, technical, term, in, geology, by, clarence, dutton, the, loose, broken, and, sharp, spiny, surface, of, an, a, flow, makes, hiking, difficult, and, slow, the, clinkery, surface, actually, covers, a, massive, dense, core, which, is, the, most, active, part, of, the, flow, as, pasty, lava, in, the, core, travels, downslope, the, clinkers, are, carried, along, at, the, surface, at, the, leading, edge, of, an, a, flow, however, these, cooled, fragments, tumble, down, the, steep, front, and, are, buried, by, the, advancing, flow, this, produces, a, layer, of, lava, fragments, both, at, the, bottom, and, top, of, an, a, flow, accretionary, lava, balls, as, large, as, 3, metres, 10, feet, are, common, on, a, flows, a, is, usually, of, higher, viscosity, than, p, hoehoe, p, hoehoe, can, turn, into, a, if, it, becomes, turbulent, from, meeting, impediments, or, steep, slopes, the, sharp, angled, texture, makes, a, a, strong, radar, reflector, and, can, easily, be, seen, from, an, orbiting, satellite, bright, on, magellan, pictures, a, lavas, typically, erupt, at, temperatures, of, 1, 050, to, 1, 150, c, 1, 920, to, 2, 100, f, or, greater, p, hoehoe, also, spelled, pahoehoe, from, hawaiian, meaning, smooth, unbroken, lava, is, basaltic, lava, that, has, a, smooth, billowy, undulating, or, ropy, surface, these, surface, features, are, due, to, the, movement, of, very, fluid, lava, under, a, congealing, surface, crust, the, hawaiian, word, was, introduced, as, a, technical, term, in, geology, by, clarence, dutton, a, p, hoehoe, flow, typically, advances, as, a, series, of, small, lobes, and, toes, that, continually, break, out, from, a, cooled, crust, it, also, forms, lava, tubes, where, the, minimal, heat, loss, maintains, a, low, viscosity, the, surface, texture, of, p, hoehoe, flows, varies, widely, displaying, all, kinds, of, bizarre, shapes, often, referred, to, as, lava, sculpture, with, increasing, distance, from, the, source, p, hoehoe, flows, may, change, into, a, flows, in, response, to, heat, loss, and, consequent, increase, in, viscosity, experiments, suggest, that, the, transition, takes, place, at, a, temperature, between, 1, 200, and, 1, 170, c, 2, 190, and, 2, 140, f, with, some, dependence, on, shear, rate, pahoehoe, lavas, typically, have, a, temperature, of, 1, 100, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 010, to, 2, 190, f, on, the, earth, most, lava, flows, are, less, than, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, long, but, some, p, hoehoe, flows, are, more, than, 50, km, 31, mi, long, some, flood, basalt, flows, in, the, geologic, record, extend, for, hundreds, of, kilometres, the, rounded, texture, makes, p, hoehoe, a, poor, radar, reflector, and, is, difficult, to, see, from, an, orbiting, satellite, dark, on, magellan, picture, block, lava, flows, are, typical, of, andesitic, lavas, from, stratovolcanoes, they, behave, in, a, similar, manner, to, a, flows, but, their, more, viscous, nature, causes, the, surface, to, be, covered, in, smooth, sided, angular, fragments, blocks, of, solidified, lava, instead, of, clinkers, as, with, a, flows, the, molten, interior, of, the, flow, which, is, kept, insulated, by, the, solidified, blocky, surface, advances, over, the, rubble, that, falls, off, the, flow, front, they, also, move, much, more, slowly, downhill, and, are, thicker, in, depth, than, a, flows, pillow, lava, is, the, lava, structure, typically, formed, when, lava, emerges, from, an, underwater, volcanic, vent, or, subglacial, volcano, or, a, lava, flow, enters, the, ocean, the, viscous, lava, gains, a, solid, crust, on, contact, with, the, water, and, this, crust, cracks, and, oozes, additional, large, blobs, or, pillows, as, more, lava, emerges, from, the, advancing, flow, since, water, covers, the, majority, of, earth, s, surface, and, most, volcanoes, are, situated, near, or, under, bodies, of, water, pillow, lava, is, very, common, because, it, is, formed, from, viscous, molten, rock, lava, flows, and, eruptions, create, distinctive, formations, landforms, and, topographical, features, from, the, macroscopic, to, the, microscopic, volcanoes, are, the, primary, landforms, built, by, repeated, eruptions, of, lava, and, ash, over, time, they, range, in, shape, from, shield, volcanoes, with, broad, shallow, slopes, formed, from, predominantly, effusive, eruptions, of, relatively, fluid, basaltic, lava, flows, to, steeply, sided, stratovolcanoes, also, known, as, composite, volcanoes, made, of, alternating, layers, of, ash, and, more, viscous, lava, flows, typical, of, intermediate, and, felsic, lavas, a, caldera, which, is, a, large, subsidence, crater, can, form, in, a, stratovolcano, if, the, magma, chamber, is, partially, or, wholly, emptied, by, large, explosive, eruptions, the, summit, cone, no, longer, supports, itself, and, thus, collapses, in, on, itself, afterwards, such, features, may, include, volcanic, crater, lakes, and, lava, domes, after, the, event, however, calderas, can, also, form, by, non, explosive, means, such, as, gradual, magma, subsidence, this, is, typical, of, many, shield, volcanoes, cinder, cones, and, spatter, cones, are, small, scale, features, formed, by, lava, accumulation, around, a, small, vent, on, a, volcanic, edifice, cinder, cones, are, formed, from, tephra, or, ash, and, tuff, which, is, thrown, from, an, explosive, vent, spatter, cones, are, formed, by, accumulation, of, molten, volcanic, slag, and, cinders, ejected, in, a, more, liquid, form, another, hawaiian, english, term, derived, from, the, hawaiian, language, a, k, puka, denotes, an, elevated, area, such, as, a, hill, ridge, or, old, lava, dome, inside, or, downslope, from, an, area, of, active, volcanism, new, lava, flows, will, cover, the, surrounding, land, isolating, the, k, puka, so, that, it, appears, as, a, usually, forested, island, in, a, barren, lava, flow, lava, domes, are, formed, by, the, extrusion, of, viscous, felsic, magma, they, can, form, prominent, rounded, protuberances, such, as, at, valles, caldera, as, a, volcano, extrudes, silicic, lava, it, can, form, an, inflation, dome, or, endogenous, dome, gradually, building, up, a, large, pillow, like, structure, which, cracks, fissures, and, may, release, cooled, chunks, of, rock, and, rubble, the, top, and, side, margins, of, an, inflating, lava, dome, tend, to, be, covered, in, fragments, of, rock, breccia, and, ash, examples, of, lava, dome, eruptions, include, the, novarupta, dome, and, successive, lava, domes, of, mount, st, helens, when, a, dome, forms, on, an, inclined, surface, it, can, flow, in, short, thick, flows, called, coul, es, dome, flows, these, flows, often, travel, only, a, few, kilometres, from, the, vent, lava, tubes, are, formed, when, a, flow, of, relatively, fluid, lava, cools, on, the, upper, surface, sufficiently, to, form, a, crust, beneath, this, crust, which, being, made, of, rock, is, an, excellent, insulator, the, lava, can, continue, to, flow, as, a, liquid, when, this, flow, occurs, over, a, prolonged, period, of, time, the, lava, conduit, can, form, a, tunnel, like, aperture, or, lava, tube, which, can, conduct, molten, rock, many, kilometres, from, the, vent, without, cooling, appreciably, often, these, lava, tubes, drain, out, once, the, supply, of, fresh, lava, has, stopped, leaving, a, considerable, length, of, open, tunnel, within, the, lava, flow, lava, tubes, are, known, from, the, modern, day, eruptions, of, k, lauea, and, significant, extensive, and, open, lava, tubes, of, tertiary, age, are, known, from, north, queensland, australia, some, extending, for, 15, kilometres, 9, miles, rarely, a, volcanic, cone, may, fill, with, lava, but, not, erupt, lava, which, pools, within, the, caldera, is, known, as, a, lava, lake, lava, lakes, do, not, usually, persist, for, long, either, draining, back, into, the, magma, chamber, once, pressure, is, relieved, usually, by, venting, of, gases, through, the, caldera, or, by, draining, via, eruption, of, lava, flows, or, pyroclastic, explosion, there, are, only, a, few, sites, in, the, world, where, permanent, lakes, of, lava, exist, these, include, lava, deltas, form, wherever, sub, aerial, flows, of, lava, enter, standing, bodies, of, water, the, lava, cools, and, breaks, up, as, it, encounters, the, water, with, the, resulting, fragments, filling, in, the, seabed, topography, such, that, the, sub, aerial, flow, can, move, further, offshore, lava, deltas, are, generally, associated, with, large, scale, effusive, type, basaltic, volcanism, a, lava, fountain, is, a, volcanic, phenomenon, in, which, lava, is, forcefully, but, non, explosively, ejected, from, a, crater, vent, or, fissure, the, highest, lava, fountain, recorded, was, during, the, 23, november, 2013, eruption, of, mount, etna, in, italy, which, reached, a, stable, height, of, around, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, for, 18, minutes, briefly, peaking, at, a, height, of, 3, 400, m, 11, 000, ft, lava, fountains, may, occur, as, a, series, of, short, pulses, or, a, continuous, jet, of, lava, they, are, commonly, associated, with, hawaiian, eruptions, lava, flows, are, enormously, destructive, to, property, in, their, path, however, casualties, are, rare, since, flows, are, usually, slow, enough, for, people, and, animals, to, escape, though, this, is, dependent, on, the, viscosity, of, the, lava, nevertheless, injuries, and, deaths, have, occurred, either, because, they, had, their, escape, route, cut, off, because, they, got, too, close, to, the, flow, or, more, rarely, if, the, lava, flow, front, travels, too, quickly, this, notably, happened, during, the, eruption, of, nyiragongo, in, zaire, now, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, on, the, night, of, 10, january, 1977, a, crater, wall, was, breached, and, a, fluid, lava, lake, drained, out, in, under, an, hour, the, resulting, flow, sped, down, the, steep, slopes, at, up, to, 100, km, h, 62, mph, and, overwhelmed, several, villages, while, residents, were, asleep, as, a, result, of, this, disaster, the, mountain, was, designated, a, decade, volcano, in, 1991, deaths, attributed, to, volcanoes, frequently, have, a, different, cause, for, example, volcanic, ejecta, pyroclastic, flow, from, a, collapsing, lava, dome, lahars, poisonous, gases, that, travel, ahead, of, lava, or, explosions, caused, when, the, flow, comes, into, contact, with, water, a, particularly, dangerous, area, is, called, a, lava, bench, this, very, young, ground, will, typically, break, off, and, fall, into, the, sea, areas, of, recent, lava, flows, continue, to, represent, a, hazard, long, after, the, lava, has, cooled, where, young, flows, have, created, new, lands, land, is, more, unstable, and, can, break, off, into, the, sea, flows, often, crack, deeply, forming, dangerous, chasms, and, a, fall, against, a, lava, is, similar, to, falling, against, broken, glass, rugged, hiking, boots, long, pants, and, gloves, are, recommended, when, crossing, lava, flows, diverting, a, lava, flow, is, extremely, difficult, but, it, can, be, accomplished, in, some, circumstances, as, was, once, partially, achieved, in, vestmannaeyjar, iceland, the, optimal, design, of, simple, low, cost, barriers, that, divert, lava, flows, is, an, area, of, ongoing, research, tephra, is, lava, in, the, form, of, volcanic, ash, lapilli, volcanic, bombs, or, volcanic, blocks
