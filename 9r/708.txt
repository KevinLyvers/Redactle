https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna
a, savanna, or, savannah, is, a, mixed, woodland, grassland, i, e, grassy, woodland, biome, and, ecosystem, characterised, by, the, trees, being, sufficiently, widely, spaced, so, that, the, canopy, does, not, close, the, open, canopy, allows, sufficient, light, to, reach, the, ground, to, support, an, unbroken, herbaceous, layer, consisting, primarily, of, grasses, four, savanna, forms, exist, savanna, woodland, where, trees, and, shrubs, form, a, light, canopy, tree, savanna, with, scattered, trees, and, shrubs, shrub, savanna, with, distributed, shrubs, and, grass, savanna, where, trees, and, shrubs, are, mostly, nonexistent, savannas, maintain, an, open, canopy, despite, a, high, tree, density, it, is, often, believed, that, savannas, feature, widely, spaced, scattered, trees, however, in, many, savannas, tree, densities, are, higher, and, trees, are, more, regularly, spaced, than, in, forests, the, south, american, savanna, types, cerrado, sensu, stricto, and, cerrado, dense, typically, have, densities, of, trees, similar, to, or, higher, than, that, found, in, south, american, tropical, forests, with, savanna, ranging, from, 800, to, 3300, trees, per, hectare, trees, ha, and, adjacent, forests, with, 800, 2000, trees, ha, similarly, guinean, savanna, has, 129, trees, ha, compared, to, 103, for, riparian, forest, while, eastern, australian, sclerophyll, forests, have, average, tree, densities, of, approximately, 100, per, hectare, comparable, to, savannas, in, the, same, region, savannas, are, also, characterised, by, seasonal, water, availability, with, the, majority, of, rainfall, confined, to, one, season, they, are, associated, with, several, types, of, biomes, and, are, frequently, in, a, transitional, zone, between, forest, and, desert, or, grassland, though, mostly, a, transition, between, desert, to, forest, savanna, covers, approximately, 20, of, the, earth, s, land, area, unlike, the, prairies, in, north, america, and, steppes, in, eurasia, which, feature, cold, winters, savannas, are, mostly, located, in, areas, having, warm, to, hot, climates, such, as, in, africa, australia, thailand, south, america, and, india, the, word, derives, from, the, spanish, sabana, which, is, itself, a, loanword, from, ta, no, which, means, treeless, grassland, in, the, west, indies, the, letter, b, in, spanish, when, positioned, in, the, middle, of, a, word, is, pronounced, almost, like, an, english, v, hence, the, change, of, grapheme, when, transcribed, into, english, the, word, originally, entered, english, as, the, zauana, in, a, description, of, the, ilands, of, the, kinges, of, spayne, from, 1555, this, was, equivalent, in, the, orthography, of, the, times, to, zavana, see, history, of, v, peter, martyr, reported, it, as, the, local, name, for, the, plain, around, comagre, the, court, of, the, cacique, carlos, in, present, day, panama, the, accounts, are, inexact, but, this, is, usually, placed, in, present, day, madugand, or, at, points, on, the, nearby, guna, yala, coast, opposite, ustupo, or, on, point, mosquitos, these, areas, are, now, either, given, over, to, modern, cropland, or, jungle, many, grassy, landscapes, and, mixed, communities, of, trees, shrubs, and, grasses, were, described, as, savanna, before, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, concept, of, a, tropical, savanna, climate, became, established, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, system, was, strongly, influenced, by, effects, of, temperature, and, precipitation, upon, tree, growth, and, oversimplified, assumptions, resulted, in, a, tropical, savanna, classification, concept, which, considered, it, as, a, climatic, climax, formation, the, common, usage, to, describe, vegetation, now, conflicts, with, a, simplified, yet, widespread, climatic, concept, the, divergence, has, sometimes, caused, areas, such, as, extensive, savannas, north, and, south, of, the, congo, and, amazon, rivers, to, be, excluded, from, mapped, savanna, categories, in, different, parts, of, north, america, the, word, savanna, has, been, used, interchangeably, with, barrens, prairie, glade, grassland, and, oak, opening, different, authors, have, defined, the, lower, limits, of, savanna, tree, coverage, as, 5, 10, and, upper, limits, range, as, 25, 80, of, an, area, two, factors, common, to, all, savanna, environments, are, rainfall, variations, from, year, to, year, and, dry, season, wildfires, in, the, americas, e, g, in, belize, central, america, savanna, vegetation, is, similar, from, mexico, to, south, america, and, to, the, caribbean, the, distinction, between, woodland, and, savanna, is, vague, and, therefore, the, two, can, be, combined, into, a, single, biome, as, both, woodlands, and, savannas, feature, open, canopied, trees, with, crowns, not, usually, interlinking, mostly, forming, 25, 60, cover, over, many, large, tropical, areas, the, dominant, biome, forest, savanna, or, grassland, can, not, be, predicted, only, by, the, climate, as, historical, events, plays, also, a, key, role, for, example, fire, activity, in, some, areas, indeed, it, is, possible, for, there, to, be, multiple, stable, biomes, the, annual, rainfall, ranges, from, 500, mm, 19, 69, in, to, 1, 270, mm, 50, 00, in, per, year, with, the, precipitation, being, more, common, in, six, or, eight, months, of, the, year, followed, by, a, period, of, drought, savannas, may, at, times, be, classified, as, forests, in, climatic, geomorphology, it, has, been, noted, that, many, savannas, occur, in, areas, of, pediplains, and, inselbergs, it, has, been, posited, that, river, incision, is, not, prominent, but, that, rivers, in, savanna, landscapes, erode, more, by, lateral, migration, flooding, and, associated, sheet, wash, have, been, proposed, as, dominant, erosion, processes, in, savanna, plains, the, savannas, of, tropical, america, comprise, broadleaved, trees, such, as, curatella, byrsonima, and, bowdichia, with, grasses, such, as, leersia, and, paspalum, bean, relative, prosopis, is, common, in, the, argentinian, savannas, in, the, east, african, savannas, acacia, combretum, baobabs, borassus, and, euphorbia, are, a, common, vegetation, genera, drier, savannas, there, feature, spiny, shrubs, and, grasses, such, as, andropogon, hyparrhenia, and, themeda, wetter, savannas, include, brachystegia, trees, and, pennisetum, purpureum, and, elephant, grass, type, west, african, savanna, trees, include, anogeissus, combretum, and, strychnos, indian, savannas, are, mostly, cleared, but, the, reserved, ones, feature, acacia, mimosa, and, zizyphus, over, a, grass, cover, comprising, sehima, and, dichanthium, the, australian, savanna, is, abundant, with, sclerophyllous, evergreen, vegetation, which, include, the, eucalyptus, as, well, as, acacia, bauhinia, pandanus, with, grasses, such, as, heteropogon, and, kangaroo, grass, themeda, animals, in, the, african, savanna, generally, include, the, giraffe, elephant, buffalo, zebra, gnu, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and, antelope, where, they, rely, on, grass, and, or, tree, foliage, to, survive, in, the, australian, savanna, mammals, in, the, family, macropodidae, predominate, such, as, kangaroos, and, wallabies, though, cattle, horses, camels, donkeys, and, the, asian, water, buffalo, among, others, have, been, introduced, by, humans, it, is, estimated, that, less, than, three, percent, of, savanna, ecosystems, can, be, classified, as, highly, intact, reasons, for, savanna, degradation, are, manifold, as, outlined, below, savannas, are, subject, to, regular, wildfires, and, the, ecosystem, appears, to, be, the, result, of, human, use, of, fire, for, example, native, americans, created, the, pre, columbian, woodlands, of, north, america, by, periodically, burning, where, fire, resistant, plants, were, the, dominant, species, aboriginal, burning, appears, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, widespread, occurrence, of, savanna, in, tropical, australia, and, new, guinea, and, savannas, in, india, are, a, result, of, human, fire, use, the, maquis, shrub, savannas, of, the, mediterranean, region, were, likewise, created, and, maintained, by, anthropogenic, fire, intentional, controlled, burns, typically, create, fires, confined, to, the, herbaceous, layer, that, do, little, long, term, damage, to, mature, trees, this, prevents, more, catastrophic, wildfires, that, could, do, much, more, damage, however, these, fires, either, kill, or, suppress, tree, seedlings, thus, preventing, the, establishment, of, a, continuous, tree, canopy, which, would, prevent, further, grass, growth, prior, to, european, settlement, aboriginal, land, use, practices, including, fire, influenced, vegetation, and, may, have, maintained, and, modified, savanna, flora, it, has, been, suggested, by, many, authors, that, aboriginal, burning, created, a, structurally, more, open, savanna, landscape, aboriginal, burning, certainly, created, a, habitat, mosaic, that, probably, increased, biodiversity, and, changed, the, structure, of, woodlands, and, geographic, range, of, numerous, woodland, species, it, has, been, suggested, by, many, authors, that, with, the, removal, or, alteration, of, traditional, burning, regimes, many, savannas, are, being, replaced, by, forest, and, shrub, thickets, with, little, herbaceous, layer, the, consumption, of, herbage, by, introduced, grazers, in, savanna, woodlands, has, led, to, a, reduction, in, the, amount, of, fuel, available, for, burning, and, resulted, in, fewer, and, cooler, fires, the, introduction, of, exotic, pasture, legumes, has, also, led, to, a, reduction, in, the, need, to, burn, to, produce, a, flush, of, green, growth, because, legumes, retain, high, nutrient, levels, throughout, the, year, and, because, fires, can, have, a, negative, impact, on, legume, populations, which, causes, a, reluctance, to, burn, the, closed, forest, types, such, as, broadleaf, forests, and, rainforests, are, usually, not, grazed, owing, to, the, closed, structure, precluding, grass, growth, and, hence, offering, little, opportunity, for, grazing, in, contrast, the, open, structure, of, savannas, allows, the, growth, of, a, herbaceous, layer, and, is, commonly, used, for, grazing, domestic, livestock, as, a, result, much, of, the, world, s, savannas, have, undergone, change, as, a, result, of, grazing, by, sheep, goats, and, cattle, ranging, from, changes, in, pasture, composition, to, woody, plant, encroachment, the, removal, of, grass, by, grazing, affects, the, woody, plant, component, of, woodland, systems, in, two, major, ways, grasses, compete, with, woody, plants, for, water, in, the, topsoil, and, removal, by, grazing, reduces, this, competitive, effect, potentially, boosting, tree, growth, in, addition, to, this, effect, the, removal, of, fuel, reduces, both, the, intensity, and, the, frequency, of, fires, which, may, control, woody, plant, species, grazing, animals, can, have, a, more, direct, effect, on, woody, plants, by, the, browsing, of, palatable, woody, species, there, is, evidence, that, unpalatable, woody, plants, have, increased, under, grazing, in, savannas, grazing, also, promotes, the, spread, of, weeds, in, savannas, by, the, removal, or, reduction, of, the, plants, which, would, normally, compete, with, potential, weeds, and, hinder, establishment, in, addition, to, this, cattle, and, horses, are, implicated, in, the, spread, of, the, seeds, of, weed, species, such, as, prickly, acacia, acacia, nilotica, and, stylo, stylosanthes, species, alterations, in, savanna, species, composition, brought, about, by, grazing, can, alter, ecosystem, function, and, are, exacerbated, by, overgrazing, and, poor, land, management, practices, introduced, grazing, animals, can, also, affect, soil, condition, through, physical, compaction, and, break, up, of, the, soil, caused, by, the, hooves, of, animals, and, through, the, erosion, effects, caused, by, the, removal, of, protective, plant, cover, such, effects, are, most, likely, to, occur, on, land, subjected, to, repeated, and, heavy, grazing, the, effects, of, overstocking, are, often, worst, on, soils, of, low, fertility, and, in, low, rainfall, areas, below, 500, mm, as, most, soil, nutrients, in, these, areas, tend, to, be, concentrated, in, the, surface, so, any, movement, of, soils, can, lead, to, severe, degradation, alteration, in, soil, structure, and, nutrient, levels, affects, the, establishment, growth, and, survival, of, plant, species, and, in, turn, can, lead, to, a, change, in, woodland, structure, and, composition, that, being, said, impact, of, grazing, animals, can, be, reduced, looking, at, elephant, impact, on, savannas, the, overall, impact, is, reduced, in, the, presence, of, rainfall, and, fences, large, areas, of, australian, and, south, american, savannas, have, been, cleared, of, trees, and, this, clearing, continues, today, for, example, land, clearing, and, fracking, threaten, the, northern, territory, australia, savanna, and, 480, 000, ha, of, savanna, were, being, cleared, annually, in, queensland, in, the, 2000s, primarily, to, improve, pasture, production, substantial, savanna, areas, have, been, cleared, of, woody, vegetation, and, much, of, the, area, that, remains, today, is, vegetation, that, has, been, disturbed, by, either, clearing, or, thinning, at, some, point, in, the, past, clearing, is, carried, out, by, the, grazing, industry, in, an, attempt, to, increase, the, quality, and, quantity, of, feed, available, for, stock, and, to, improve, the, management, of, livestock, the, removal, of, trees, from, savanna, land, removes, the, competition, for, water, from, the, grasses, present, and, can, lead, to, a, two, to, fourfold, increase, in, pasture, production, as, well, as, improving, the, quality, of, the, feed, available, since, stock, carrying, capacity, is, strongly, correlated, with, herbage, yield, there, can, be, major, financial, benefits, from, the, removal, of, trees, such, as, assisting, with, grazing, management, regions, of, dense, tree, and, shrub, cover, harbors, predators, leading, to, increased, stock, losses, for, example, while, woody, plant, cover, hinders, mustering, in, both, sheep, and, cattle, areas, a, number, of, techniques, have, been, employed, to, clear, or, kill, woody, plants, in, savannas, early, pastoralists, used, felling, and, girdling, the, removal, of, a, ring, of, bark, and, sapwood, as, a, means, of, clearing, land, in, the, 1950s, arboricides, suitable, for, stem, injection, were, developed, war, surplus, heavy, machinery, was, made, available, and, these, were, used, for, either, pushing, timber, or, for, pulling, using, a, chain, and, ball, strung, between, two, machines, these, two, new, methods, of, timber, control, along, with, the, introduction, and, widespread, adoption, of, several, new, pasture, grasses, and, legumes, promoted, a, resurgence, in, tree, clearing, the, 1980s, also, saw, the, release, of, soil, applied, arboricides, notably, tebuthiuron, that, could, be, utilised, without, cutting, and, injecting, each, individual, tree, in, many, ways, artificial, clearing, particularly, pulling, mimics, the, effects, of, fire, and, in, savannas, adapted, to, regeneration, after, fire, as, most, queensland, savannas, are, there, is, a, similar, response, to, that, after, fire, tree, clearing, in, many, savanna, communities, although, causing, a, dramatic, reduction, in, basal, area, and, canopy, cover, often, leaves, a, high, percentage, of, woody, plants, alive, either, as, seedlings, too, small, to, be, affected, or, as, plants, capable, of, re, sprouting, from, lignotubers, and, broken, stumps, a, population, of, woody, plants, equal, to, half, or, more, of, the, original, number, often, remains, following, pulling, of, eucalypt, communities, even, if, all, the, trees, over, 5, metres, are, uprooted, completely, a, number, of, exotic, plants, species, have, been, introduced, to, savannas, around, the, world, amongst, the, woody, plant, species, are, serious, environmental, weeds, such, as, prickly, acacia, acacia, nilotica, rubbervine, cryptostegia, grandiflora, mesquite, prosopis, spp, lantana, lantana, camara, and, l, montevidensis, and, prickly, pear, opuntia, spp, a, range, of, herbaceous, species, have, also, been, introduced, to, these, woodlands, either, deliberately, or, accidentally, including, rhodes, grass, and, other, chloris, species, buffel, grass, cenchrus, ciliaris, giant, rat, s, tail, grass, sporobolus, pyramidalis, parthenium, parthenium, hysterophorus, and, stylos, stylosanthes, spp, and, other, legumes, these, introductions, have, the, potential, to, significantly, alter, the, structure, and, composition, of, savannas, worldwide, and, have, already, done, so, in, many, areas, through, a, number, of, processes, including, altering, the, fire, regime, increasing, grazing, pressure, competing, with, native, vegetation, and, occupying, previously, vacant, ecological, niches, other, plant, species, include, white, sage, spotted, cactus, cotton, seed, rosemary, human, induced, climate, change, resulting, from, the, greenhouse, effect, may, result, in, an, alteration, of, the, structure, and, function, of, savannas, some, authors, have, suggested, that, savannas, and, grasslands, may, become, even, more, susceptible, to, woody, plant, encroachment, as, a, result, of, greenhouse, induced, climate, change, however, a, recent, case, described, a, savanna, increasing, its, range, at, the, expense, of, forest, in, response, to, climate, variation, and, potential, exists, for, similar, rapid, dramatic, shifts, in, vegetation, distribution, as, a, result, of, global, climate, change, particularly, at, ecotones, such, as, savannas, so, often, represent, a, savanna, can, simply, be, distinguished, by, the, open, savanna, where, grass, prevails, and, trees, are, rare, and, the, wooded, savanna, where, the, trees, are, densest, bordering, an, open, woodland, or, forest, specific, savanna, ecoregions, of, several, different, types, include
