bernoulli, s, principle, is, a, key, concept, in, fluid, dynamics, that, relates, pressure, speed, and, height, bernoulli, s, principle, states, that, an, increase, in, the, speed, of, a, parcel, of, fluid, occurs, simultaneously, with, a, decrease, in, either, the, pressure, or, the, height, above, a, datum, ch, 3, 156, 164, 3, 5, the, principle, is, named, after, the, swiss, mathematician, and, physicist, daniel, bernoulli, who, published, it, in, his, book, hydrodynamica, in, 1738, although, bernoulli, deduced, that, pressure, decreases, when, the, flow, speed, increases, it, was, leonhard, euler, in, 1752, who, derived, bernoulli, s, equation, in, its, usual, form, bernoulli, s, principle, can, be, derived, from, the, principle, of, conservation, of, energy, this, states, that, in, a, steady, flow, the, sum, of, all, forms, of, energy, in, a, fluid, is, the, same, at, all, points, that, are, free, of, viscous, forces, this, requires, that, the, sum, of, kinetic, energy, potential, energy, and, internal, energy, remains, constant, 3, 5, thus, an, increase, in, the, speed, of, the, fluid, implying, an, increase, in, its, kinetic, energy, occurs, with, a, simultaneous, decrease, in, the, sum, of, its, potential, energy, including, the, static, pressure, and, internal, energy, if, the, fluid, is, flowing, out, of, a, reservoir, the, sum, of, all, forms, of, energy, is, the, same, because, in, a, reservoir, the, energy, per, unit, volume, the, sum, of, pressure, and, gravitational, potential, g, h, is, the, same, everywhere, example, 3, 5, and, p, 116, bernoulli, s, principle, can, also, be, derived, directly, from, isaac, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, if, a, small, volume, of, fluid, is, flowing, horizontally, from, a, region, of, high, pressure, to, a, region, of, low, pressure, then, there, is, more, pressure, behind, than, in, front, this, gives, a, net, force, on, the, volume, accelerating, it, along, the, streamline, fluid, particles, are, subject, only, to, pressure, and, their, own, weight, if, a, fluid, is, flowing, horizontally, and, along, a, section, of, a, streamline, where, the, speed, increases, it, can, only, be, because, the, fluid, on, that, section, has, moved, from, a, region, of, higher, pressure, to, a, region, of, lower, pressure, and, if, its, speed, decreases, it, can, only, be, because, it, has, moved, from, a, region, of, lower, pressure, to, a, region, of, higher, pressure, consequently, within, a, fluid, flowing, horizontally, the, highest, speed, occurs, where, the, pressure, is, lowest, and, the, lowest, speed, occurs, where, the, pressure, is, highest, bernoulli, s, principle, is, only, applicable, for, isentropic, flows, when, the, effects, of, irreversible, processes, like, turbulence, and, non, adiabatic, processes, e, g, thermal, radiation, are, small, and, can, be, neglected, however, the, principle, can, be, applied, to, various, types, of, flow, within, these, bounds, resulting, in, various, forms, of, bernoulli, s, equation, the, simple, form, of, bernoulli, s, equation, is, valid, for, incompressible, flows, e, g, most, liquid, flows, and, gases, moving, at, low, mach, number, more, advanced, forms, may, be, applied, to, compressible, flows, at, higher, mach, numbers, in, most, flows, of, liquids, and, of, gases, at, low, mach, number, the, density, of, a, fluid, parcel, can, be, considered, to, be, constant, regardless, of, pressure, variations, in, the, flow, therefore, the, fluid, can, be, considered, to, be, incompressible, and, these, flows, are, called, incompressible, flows, bernoulli, performed, his, experiments, on, liquids, so, his, equation, in, its, original, form, is, valid, only, for, incompressible, flow, a, common, form, of, bernoulli, s, equation, is, where, bernoulli, s, equation, and, the, bernoulli, constant, are, applicable, throughout, any, region, of, flow, where, the, energy, per, unit, mass, is, uniform, because, the, energy, per, unit, mass, of, liquid, in, a, well, mixed, reservoir, is, uniform, throughout, bernoulli, s, equation, can, be, used, to, analyze, the, fluid, flow, everywhere, in, that, reservoir, including, pipes, or, flow, fields, that, the, reservoir, feeds, except, where, viscous, forces, dominate, and, erode, the, energy, per, unit, mass, example, 3, 5, and, p, 116, the, following, assumptions, must, be, met, for, this, bernoulli, equation, to, apply, 265, for, conservative, force, fields, not, limited, to, the, gravitational, field, bernoulli, s, equation, can, be, generalized, as, 265, v, 2, 2, p, constant, displaystyle, frac, v, 2, 2, psi, frac, p, rho, text, constant, where, is, the, force, potential, at, the, point, considered, for, example, for, the, earth, s, gravity, gz, by, multiplying, with, the, fluid, density, equation, a, can, be, rewritten, as, 1, 2, v, 2, g, z, p, constant, displaystyle, tfrac, 1, 2, rho, v, 2, rho, gz, p, text, constant, or, q, g, h, p, 0, g, z, constant, displaystyle, q, rho, gh, p, 0, rho, gz, text, constant, where, the, constant, in, the, bernoulli, equation, can, be, normalized, a, common, approach, is, in, terms, of, total, head, or, energy, head, h, h, z, p, g, v, 2, 2, g, h, v, 2, 2, g, displaystyle, h, z, frac, p, rho, g, frac, v, 2, 2g, h, frac, v, 2, 2g, the, above, equations, suggest, there, is, a, flow, speed, at, which, pressure, is, zero, and, at, even, higher, speeds, the, pressure, is, negative, most, often, gases, and, liquids, are, not, capable, of, negative, absolute, pressure, or, even, zero, pressure, so, clearly, bernoulli, s, equation, ceases, to, be, valid, before, zero, pressure, is, reached, in, liquids, when, the, pressure, becomes, too, low, cavitation, occurs, the, above, equations, use, a, linear, relationship, between, flow, speed, squared, and, pressure, at, higher, flow, speeds, in, gases, or, for, sound, waves, in, liquid, the, changes, in, mass, density, become, significant, so, that, the, assumption, of, constant, density, is, invalid, in, many, applications, of, bernoulli, s, equation, the, change, in, the, gz, term, is, so, small, compared, with, the, other, terms, that, it, can, be, ignored, for, example, in, the, case, of, aircraft, in, flight, the, change, in, height, z, is, so, small, the, gz, term, can, be, omitted, this, allows, the, above, equation, to, be, presented, in, the, following, simplified, form, p, q, p, 0, displaystyle, p, q, p, 0, where, p, 0, is, called, total, pressure, and, q, is, dynamic, pressure, many, authors, refer, to, the, pressure, p, as, static, pressure, to, distinguish, it, from, total, pressure, p, 0, and, dynamic, pressure, q, in, aerodynamics, l, j, clancy, writes, to, distinguish, it, from, the, total, and, dynamic, pressures, the, actual, pressure, of, the, fluid, which, is, associated, not, with, its, motion, but, with, its, state, is, often, referred, to, as, the, static, pressure, but, where, the, term, pressure, alone, is, used, it, refers, to, this, static, pressure, 3, 5, the, simplified, form, of, bernoulli, s, equation, can, be, summarized, in, the, following, memorable, word, equation, 3, 5, every, point, in, a, steadily, flowing, fluid, regardless, of, the, fluid, speed, at, that, point, has, its, own, unique, static, pressure, p, and, dynamic, pressure, q, their, sum, p, q, is, defined, to, be, the, total, pressure, p, 0, the, significance, of, bernoulli, s, principle, can, now, be, summarized, as, total, pressure, is, constant, in, any, region, free, of, viscous, forces, if, the, fluid, flow, is, brought, to, rest, at, some, point, this, point, is, called, a, stagnation, point, and, at, this, point, the, static, pressure, is, equal, to, the, stagnation, pressure, if, the, fluid, flow, is, irrotational, the, total, pressure, is, uniform, and, bernoulli, s, principle, can, be, summarized, as, total, pressure, is, constant, everywhere, in, the, fluid, flow, equation, 3, 12, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, that, irrotational, flow, exists, in, any, situation, where, a, large, body, of, fluid, is, flowing, past, a, solid, body, examples, are, aircraft, in, flight, and, ships, moving, in, open, bodies, of, water, however, bernoulli, s, principle, importantly, does, not, apply, in, the, boundary, layer, such, as, in, flow, through, long, pipes, the, bernoulli, equation, for, unsteady, potential, flow, is, used, in, the, theory, of, ocean, surface, waves, and, acoustics, for, an, irrotational, flow, the, flow, velocity, can, be, described, as, the, gradient, of, a, velocity, potential, in, that, case, and, for, a, constant, density, the, momentum, equations, of, the, euler, equations, can, be, integrated, to, 383, t, 1, 2, v, 2, p, g, z, f, t, displaystyle, frac, partial, varphi, partial, t, tfrac, 1, 2, v, 2, frac, p, rho, gz, f, t, which, is, a, bernoulli, equation, valid, also, for, unsteady, or, time, dependent, flows, here, t, denotes, the, partial, derivative, of, the, velocity, potential, with, respect, to, time, t, and, v, is, the, flow, speed, the, function, f, t, depends, only, on, time, and, not, on, position, in, the, fluid, as, a, result, the, bernoulli, equation, at, some, moment, t, applies, in, the, whole, fluid, domain, this, is, also, true, for, the, special, case, of, a, steady, irrotational, flow, in, which, case, f, and, t, are, constants, so, equation, a, can, be, applied, in, every, point, of, the, fluid, domain, 383, further, f, t, can, be, made, equal, to, zero, by, incorporating, it, into, the, velocity, potential, using, the, transformation, t, 0, t, f, d, displaystyle, phi, varphi, int, t, 0, t, f, tau, mathrm, d, tau, resulting, in, t, 1, 2, v, 2, p, g, z, 0, displaystyle, frac, partial, phi, partial, t, tfrac, 1, 2, v, 2, frac, p, rho, gz, 0, note, that, the, relation, of, the, potential, to, the, flow, velocity, is, unaffected, by, this, transformation, the, bernoulli, equation, for, unsteady, potential, flow, also, appears, to, play, a, central, role, in, luke, s, variational, principle, a, variational, description, of, free, surface, flows, using, the, lagrangian, mechanics, bernoulli, developed, his, principle, from, observations, on, liquids, and, bernoulli, s, equation, is, valid, for, ideal, fluids, those, that, are, incompressible, irrotational, inviscid, and, subjected, to, conservative, forces, it, is, sometimes, valid, for, the, flow, of, gases, provided, that, there, is, no, transfer, of, kinetic, or, potential, energy, from, the, gas, flow, to, the, compression, or, expansion, of, the, gas, if, both, the, gas, pressure, and, volume, change, simultaneously, then, work, will, be, done, on, or, by, the, gas, in, this, case, bernoulli, s, equation, in, its, incompressible, flow, form, cannot, be, assumed, to, be, valid, however, if, the, gas, process, is, entirely, isobaric, or, isochoric, then, no, work, is, done, on, or, by, the, gas, so, the, simple, energy, balance, is, not, upset, according, to, the, gas, law, an, isobaric, or, isochoric, process, is, ordinarily, the, only, way, to, ensure, constant, density, in, a, gas, also, the, gas, density, will, be, proportional, to, the, ratio, of, pressure, and, absolute, temperature, however, this, ratio, will, vary, upon, compression, or, expansion, no, matter, what, non, zero, quantity, of, heat, is, added, or, removed, the, only, exception, is, if, the, net, heat, transfer, is, zero, as, in, a, complete, thermodynamic, cycle, or, in, an, individual, isentropic, frictionless, adiabatic, process, and, even, then, this, reversible, process, must, be, reversed, to, restore, the, gas, to, the, original, pressure, and, specific, volume, and, thus, density, only, then, is, the, original, unmodified, bernoulli, equation, applicable, in, this, case, the, equation, can, be, used, if, the, flow, speed, of, the, gas, is, sufficiently, below, the, speed, of, sound, such, that, the, variation, in, density, of, the, gas, due, to, this, effect, along, each, streamline, can, be, ignored, adiabatic, flow, at, less, than, mach, 0, 3, is, generally, considered, to, be, slow, enough, it, is, possible, to, use, the, fundamental, principles, of, physics, to, develop, similar, equations, applicable, to, compressible, fluids, there, are, numerous, equations, each, tailored, for, a, particular, application, but, all, are, analogous, to, bernoulli, s, equation, and, all, rely, on, nothing, more, than, the, fundamental, principles, of, physics, such, as, newton, s, laws, of, motion, or, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, for, a, compressible, fluid, with, a, barotropic, equation, of, state, and, under, the, action, of, conservative, forces, v, 2, 2, p, 1, p, d, p,

situations, elevations, are, generally, small, compared, to, the, size, of, the, earth, and, the, time, scales, of, fluid, flow, are, small, enough, to, consider, the, equation, of, state, as, adiabatic, in, this, case, the, above, equation, for, an, ideal, gas, becomes, 3, 11, v, 2, 2, g, z, 1, p, constant, along, a, streamline, displaystyle, frac, v, 2, 2, gz, left, frac, gamma, gamma, 1,

compared, to, the, other, terms, so, the, term, gz, can, be, omitted, a, very, useful, form, of, the, equation, is, then, v, 2, 2, 1, p, 1, p, 0, 0, displaystyle, frac, v, 2, 2, left, frac, gamma,

steady, flow, is, 3, 5, 5, 5, 9, v, 2, 2, w, constant, displaystyle, frac, v, 2, 2, psi, w, text, constant, here, w, is, the, enthalpy, per, unit, mass, also, known, as, specific, enthalpy, which, is,

flow, form, the, constant, on, the, right, hand, side, is, often, called, the, bernoulli, constant, and, denoted, b, for, steady, inviscid, adiabatic, flow, with, no, additional, sources, or, sinks, of, energy, b, is, constant, along, any, given, streamline, more, generally, when, b, may, vary, along, streamlines, it, still, proves, a, useful, parameter, related, to, the, head, of, the, fluid, see, below, when, the, change, in, can, be, ignored, a, very, useful, form, of, this, equation, is, v, 2, 2, w, w, 0, displaystyle, frac, v, 2, 2, w, w, 0, where, w, 0, is, total, enthalpy, for, a, calorically, perfect, gas, such, as, an, ideal, gas, the, enthalpy, is, directly, proportional, to, the, temperature, and, this, leads, to, the, concept, of, the, total, or, stagnation, temperature, when, shock, waves, are, present, in, a, reference, frame, in, which, the, shock, is, stationary, and, the, flow, is, steady, many, of, the, parameters, in, the, bernoulli, equation, suffer, abrupt, changes, in, passing, through, the, shock, the, bernoulli, parameter, remains, unaffected, an, exception, to, this, rule, is, radiative, shocks, which, violate, the, assumptions, leading, to, the, bernoulli, equation, namely, the, lack, of, additional, sinks, or, sources, of, energy, for, a, compressible, fluid, with, a, barotropic, equation, of, state, the, unsteady, momentum, conservation,

bernoulli, equation, for, incompressible, fluids, can, be, derived, by, either, integrating, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, or, by, applying, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, ignoring, viscosity, compressibility, and, thermal, effects, the, simplest, derivation, is, to, first, ignore, gravity, and, consider, constrictions, and, expansions, in, pipes, that, are, otherwise, straight, as, seen, in, venturi, effect, let, the, x, axis, be, directed, down, the, axis, of, the, pipe, define, a, parcel, of, fluid, moving, through, a, pipe, with, cross, sectional, area, a, the, length, of, the, parcel, is, d, x, and, the, volume, of, the, parcel, a, d, x, if, mass, density, is, the, mass, of, the, parcel, is, density, multiplied, by, its, volume, m, a, d, x, the, change, in,

the, parcel, of, fluid, is, a, d, p, if, the, pressure, decreases, along, the, length, of, the, pipe, d, p, is, negative, but, the, force, resulting, in, flow, is, positive, along, the, x, axis, m, d,

so, v, itself, is, not, directly, a, function, of, time, t, it, is, only, when, the, parcel, moves, through, x, that, the, cross, sectional, area, changes, v, depends, on, t, only, through, the,

where, c, is, a, constant, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, bernoulli, constant, it, is, not, a, universal, constant, but, rather, a, constant, of, a, particular, fluid, system, the, deduction, is, where, the, speed, is, large, pressure, is, low, and, vice, versa, in, the, above, derivation, no, external, work, energy, principle, is, invoked, rather, bernoulli, s, principle, was, derived, by, a, simple, manipulation, of, newton, s, second, law, another, way, to, derive, bernoulli, s, principle, for, an, incompressible, flow, is, by, applying, conservation, of, energy, in, the, form, of, the,

the, head, equation, derived, from, bernoulli, s, principle, the, middle, term, z, represents, the, potential, energy, of, the, fluid, due, to, its, elevation, with, respect, to, a, reference, plane, now, z, is, called, the, elevation, head, and, given, the, designation, z, elevation, a, free, falling, mass, from, an, elevation, z, 0, in, a, vacuum, will, reach, a, speed, v, 2, g, z, displaystyle,

length, measurement, it, represents, the, internal, energy, of, the, fluid, due, to, the, pressure, exerted, on, the, container, the, head, due, to, the, flow, speed, and, the, head, due, to, static, pressure, combined, with, the, elevation, above, a, reference, plane, a, simple, relationship, useful, for, incompressible, fluids, using, the, velocity, head, elevation, head, and, pressure, head, is, obtained, if, eqn, 1, is, multiplied, by, the, density, of, the, fluid, an, equation, with, three, pressure, terms, is, obtained, note, that, the, pressure, of, the, system, is, constant, in, this, form, of, the, bernoulli, equation, if, the, static, pressure, of, the, system, the, third, term, increases, and, if, the, pressure, due, to, elevation, the, middle, term, is, constant, then, the, dynamic, pressure, the, first, term, must, have, decreased, in, other, words, if, the, speed, of, a, fluid, decreases, and, it, is, not, due, to, an, elevation, difference, it, must, be, due, to, an, increase, in, the, static, pressure, that, is, resisting, the, flow, all, three, equations, are, merely, simplified, versions, of, an, energy, balance, on, a, system, the, derivation, for, compressible, fluids, is, similar, again, the, derivation, depends, upon, 1, conservation, of, mass, and, 2, conservation, of, energy, conservation, of, mass, implies, that, in, the, above, figure,

entering, or, leaving, through, one, or, the, other, of, these, two, boundaries, clearly, in, a, more, complicated, situation, such, as, a, fluid, flow, coupled, with, radiation, such, conditions,

successfully, explained, by, application, of, bernoulli, s, principle, even, though, no, real, fluid, is, entirely, inviscid, and, a, small, viscosity, often, has, a, large, effect, on, the, flow, one, of, the, most, common, erroneous, explanations, of, aerodynamic, lift, asserts, that, the, air, must, traverse, the, upper, and, lower, surfaces, of, a, wing, in, the, same, amount, of, time, implying, that, since, the, upper, surface, presents, a, longer, path, the, air, must, be, moving, over, the, top, of, the, wing, faster, than, over, the, bottom, bernoulli, s, principle, is, then, cited, to, conclude, that, the, pressure, on, top, of, the, wing, must, be, lower, than, on, the, bottom, equal, transit, time, applies, to, the, flow, around, a, body, generating, no, lift, but, there, is, no, physical, principle, that, requires, equal, transit, time, in, cases, of, bodies, generating, lift, in, fact, theory, predicts, and, experiments, confirm, that, the, air, traverses, the, top, surface, of, a, body, experiencing, lift, in, a, shorter, time, than, it, traverses, the, bottom, surface, the, explanation, based, on, equal, transit, time, is, false, while, the, equal, time, explanation, is, false, it, is, not, the, bernoulli, principle, that, is, false, because, this, principle, is, well, established, bernoulli, s, equation, is, used, correctly, in, common, mathematical, treatments, of, aerodynamic, lift, there, are, several, common, classroom, demonstrations, that, are, sometimes, incorrectly, explained, using, bernoulli, s, principle, one, involves, holding, a, piece, of, paper, horizontally, so, that, it, droops, downward, and, then, blowing, over, the, top, of, it, as, the, demonstrator, blows, over, the, paper, the, paper, rises, it, is, then, asserted, that, this, is, because, faster, moving, air, has, lower, pressure, one, problem, with, this, explanation, can, be, seen, by, blowing, along, the, bottom, of, the, paper, if, the, deflection, was, caused, by, faster, moving, air, then, the, paper, should, deflect, downward, but, the, paper, deflects, upward, regardless, of, whether, the, faster, moving, air, is, on, the, top, or, the, bottom, another, problem, is, that, when, the, air, leaves, the, demonstrator, s, mouth, it, has, the, same, pressure, as, the, surrounding, air, the, air, does, not, have, lower, pressure, just, because, it, is, moving, in, the, demonstration, the, static, pressure, of, the, air, leaving, the, demonstrator, s, mouth, is, equal, to, the, pressure, of, the, surrounding, air, a, third, problem, is, that, it, is, false, to, make, a, connection, between, the, flow, on, the, two, sides, of, the, paper, using, bernoulli, s, equation, since, the, air, above, and, below, are, different, flow, fields, and, bernoulli, s, principle, only, applies, within, a, flow, field, as, the, wording, of, the, principle, can, change, its, implications, stating, the, principle, correctly, is, important, what, bernoulli, s, principle, actually, says, is, that, within, a, flow, of, constant, energy, when, fluid, flows, through, a, region, of, lower, pressure, it, speeds, up, and, vice, versa, thus, bernoulli, s, principle, concerns, itself, with, changes, in, speed, and, changes, in, pressure, within, a, flow, field, it, cannot, be, used, to, compare, different, flow, fields, a, correct, explanation, of, why, the, paper, rises, would, observe, that, the, plume, follows, the, curve, of, the, paper, and, that, a, curved, streamline, will, develop, a, pressure, gradient, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, flow, with, the, lower, pressure, on, the, inside, of, the, curve, bernoulli, s, principle, predicts, that, the, decrease, in, pressure, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, speed, in, other, words, as, the, air, passes, over, the, paper, it, speeds, up, and, moves, faster, than, it, was, moving, when, it, left, the, demonstrator, s, mouth, but, this, is, not, apparent, from, the, demonstration, other, common, classroom, demonstrations, such, as, blowing, between, two, suspended, spheres, inflating, a, large, bag, or, suspending, a, ball, in, an, airstream, are, sometimes, explained, in, a, similarly, misleading, manner, by, saying, faster, moving, air, has, lower, pressure
