albedo, l, b, i, d, o, al, bee, doh, from, latin, albedo, whiteness, is, the, fraction, of, sunlight, that, is, diffusely, reflected, by, a, body, it, is, measured, on, a, scale, from, 0, corresponding, to, a, black, body, that, absorbs, all, incident, radiation, to, 1, corresponding, to, a, body, that, reflects, all, incident, radiation, surface, albedo, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, radiosity, j, e, to, the, irradiance, e, e, flux, per, unit, area, received, by, a, surface, the, proportion, reflected, is, not, only, determined, by, properties, of, the, surface, itself, but, also, by, the, spectral, and, angular, distribution, of, solar, radiation, reaching, the, earth, s, surface, these, factors, vary, with, atmospheric, composition, geographic, location, and, time, see, position, of, the, sun, while, bi, hemispherical, reflectance, is, calculated, for, a, single, angle, of, incidence, i, e, for, a, given, position, of, the, sun, albedo, is, the, directional, integration, of, reflectance, over, all, solar, angles, in, a, given, period, the, temporal, resolution, may, range, from, seconds, as, obtained, from, flux, measurements, to, daily, monthly, or, annual, averages, unless, given, for, a, specific, wavelength, spectral, albedo, albedo, refers, to, the, entire, spectrum, of, solar, radiation, due, to, measurement, constraints, it, is, often, given, for, the, spectrum, in, which, most, solar, energy, reaches, the, surface, between, 0, 3, and, 3, m, this, spectrum, includes, visible, light, 0, 4, 0, 7, m, which, explains, why, surfaces, with, a, low, albedo, appear, dark, e, g, trees, absorb, most, radiation, whereas, surfaces, with, a, high, albedo, appear, bright, e, g, snow, reflects, most, radiation, ice, albedo, feedback, is, a, positive, feedback, climate, process, where, a, change, in, the, area, of, ice, caps, glaciers, and, sea, ice, alters, the, albedo, and, surface, temperature, of, a, planet, ice, is, very, reflective, therefore, it, reflects, far, more, solar, energy, back, to, space, than, the, other, types, of, land, area, or, open, water, ice, albedo, feedback, plays, an, important, role, in, global, climate, change, albedo, is, an, important, concept, in, climate, science, any, albedo, in, visible, light, falls, within, a, range, of, about, 0, 9, for, fresh, snow, to, about, 0, 04, for, charcoal, one, of, the, darkest, substances, deeply, shadowed, cavities, can, achieve, an, effective, albedo, approaching, the, zero, of, a, black, body, when, seen, from, a, distance, the, ocean, surface, has, a, low, albedo, as, do, most, forests, whereas, desert, areas, have, some, of, the, highest, albedos, among, landforms, most, land, areas, are, in, an, albedo, range, of, 0, 1, to, 0, 4, the, average, albedo, of, earth, is, about, 0, 3, this, is, far, higher, than, for, the, ocean, primarily, because, of, the, contribution, of, clouds, earth, s, surface, albedo, is, regularly, estimated, via, earth, observation, satellite, sensors, such, as, nasa, s, modis, instruments, on, board, the, terra, and, aqua, satellites, and, the, ceres, instrument, on, the, suomi, npp, and, jpss, as, the, amount, of, reflected, radiation, is, only, measured, for, a, single, direction, by, satellite, not, all, directions, a, mathematical, model, is, used, to, translate, a, sample, set, of, satellite, reflectance, measurements, into, estimates, of, directional, hemispherical, reflectance, and, bi, hemispherical, reflectance, e, g, these, calculations, are, based, on, the, bidirectional, reflectance, distribution, function, brdf, which, describes, how, the, reflectance, of, a, given, surface, depends, on, the, view, angle, of, the, observer, and, the, solar, angle, bdrf, can, facilitate, translations, of, observations, of, reflectance, into, albedo, earth, s, average, surface, temperature, due, to, its, albedo, and, the, greenhouse, effect, is, currently, about, 15, c, 59, f, if, earth, were, frozen, entirely, and, hence, be, more, reflective, the, average, temperature, of, the, planet, would, drop, below, 40, c, 40, f, if, only, the, continental, land, masses, became, covered, by, glaciers, the, mean, temperature, of, the, planet, would, drop, to, about, 0, c, 32, f, in, contrast, if, the, entire, earth, was, covered, by, water, a, so, called, ocean, planet, the, average, temperature, on, the, planet, would, rise, to, almost, 27, c, 81, f, in, 2021, scientists, reported, that, earth, dimmed, by, 0, 5, over, two, decades, 1998, 2017, as, measured, by, earthshine, using, modern, photometric, techniques, this, may, have, both, been, co, caused, by, climate, change, as, well, as, a, substantial, increase, in, global, warming, however, the, link, to, climate, change, has, not, been, explored, to, date, and, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, this, represents, an, ongoing, trend, for, land, surfaces, it, has, been, shown, that, the, albedo, at, a, particular, solar, zenith, angle, i, can, be, approximated, by, the, proportionate, sum, of, two, terms, with, 1, d, displaystyle, 1, d, being, the, proportion, of, direct, radiation, from, a, given, solar, angle, and, d, displaystyle, d, being, the, proportion, of, diffuse, illumination, the, actual, albedo, displaystyle, alpha, also, called, blue, sky, albedo, can, then, be, given, as, this, formula, is, important, because, it, allows, the, albedo, to, be, calculated, for, any, given, illumination, conditions, from, a, knowledge, of, the, intrinsic, properties, of, the, surface, human, activities, e, g, deforestation, farming, and, urbanization, change, the, albedo, of, various, areas, around, the, globe, human, impacts, to, the, physical, properties, of, the, land, surface, can, perturb, the, climate, by, altering, the, earth, s, radiative, energy, balance, even, on, a, small, scale, or, when, undetected, by, satellites, urbanization, generally, decreases, albedo, commonly, being, 0, 01, 0, 02, lower, than, adjacent, croplands, which, contributes, to, global, warming, deliberately, increasing, albedo, in, urban, areas, can, mitigate, urban, heat, island, an, estimate, in, 2022, found, that, on, a, global, scale, an, albedo, increase, of, 0, 1, in, worldwide, urban, areas, would, result, in, a, cooling, effect, that, is, equivalent, to, absorbing, 44, gt, of, co, 2, emissions, intentionally, enhancing, the, albedo, of, the, earth, s, surface, along, with, its, daytime, thermal, emittance, has, been, proposed, as, a, solar, radiation, management, strategy, to, mitigate, energy, crises, and, global, warming, known, as, passive, daytime, radiative, cooling, pdrc, efforts, toward, widespread, implementation, of, pdrcs, may, focus, on, maximizing, the, albedo, of, surfaces, from, very, low, to, high, values, so, long, as, a, thermal, emittance, of, at, least, 90, can, be, achieved, the, tens, of, thousands, of, hectares, of, greenhouses, in, almer, a, spain, form, a, large, expanse, of, whitened, plastic, roofs, a, 2008, study, found, that, this, anthropogenic, change, lowered, the, local, surface, area, temperature, of, the, high, albedo, area, although, changes, were, localized, a, follow, up, study, found, that, co2, eq, emissions, associated, to, changes, in, surface, albedo, are, a, consequence, of, land, transformation, and, can, reduce, surface, temperature, increases, associated, with, climate, change, albedo, is, not, directly, dependent, on, the, illumination, because, changing, the, amount, of, incoming, light, proportionally, changes, the, amount, of, reflected, light, except, in, circumstances, where, a, change, in, illumination, induces, a, change, in, the, earth, s, surface, at, that, location, e, g, through, melting, of, reflective, ice, however, albedo, and, illumination, both, vary, by, latitude, albedo, is, highest, near, the, poles, and, lowest, in, the, subtropics, with, a, local, maximum, in, the, tropics, the, intensity, of, albedo, temperature, effects, depends, on, the, amount, of, albedo, and, the, level, of, local, insolation, solar, irradiance, high, albedo, areas, in, the, arctic, and, antarctic, regions, are, cold, due, to, low, insolation, whereas, areas, such, as, the, sahara, desert, which, also, have, a, relatively, high, albedo, will, be, hotter, due, to, high, insolation, tropical, and, sub, tropical, rainforest, areas, have, low, albedo, and, are, much, hotter, than, their, temperate, forest, counterparts, which, have, lower, insolation, because, insolation, plays, such, a, big, role, in, the, heating, and, cooling, effects, of, albedo, high, insolation, areas, like, the, tropics, will, tend, to, show, a, more, pronounced, fluctuation, in, local, temperature, when, local, albedo, changes, arctic, regions, notably, release, more, heat, back, into, space, than, what, they, absorb, effectively, cooling, the, earth, this, has, been, a, concern, since, arctic, ice, and, snow, has, been, melting, at, higher, rates, due, to, higher, temperatures, creating, regions, in, the, arctic, that, are, notably, darker, being, water, or, ground, which, is, darker, color, and, reflects, less, heat, back, into, space, this, feedback, loop, results, in, a, reduced, albedo, effect, albedo, affects, climate, by, determining, how, much, radiation, a, planet, absorbs, the, uneven, heating, of, earth, from, albedo, variations, between, land, ice, or, ocean, surfaces, can, drive, weather, the, response, of, the, climate, system, to, an, initial, forcing, is, modified, by, feedbacks, increased, by, self, reinforcing, or, positive, feedbacks, and, reduced, by, balancing, or, negative, feedbacks, the, main, reinforcing, feedbacks, are, the, water, vapour, feedback, the, ice, albedo, feedback, and, the, net, effect, of, clouds, 58, when, an, area, s, albedo, changes, due, to, snowfall, a, snow, temperature, feedback, results, a, layer, of, snowfall, increases, local, albedo, reflecting, away, sunlight, leading, to, local, cooling, in, principle, if, no, outside, temperature, change, affects, this, area, e, g, a, warm, air, mass, the, raised, albedo, and, lower, temperature, would, maintain, the, current, snow, and, invite, further, snowfall, deepening, the, snow, temperature, feedback, however, because, local, weather, is, dynamic, due, to, the, change, of, seasons, eventually, warm, air, masses, and, a, more, direct, angle, of, sunlight, higher, insolation, cause, melting, when, the, melted, area, reveals, surfaces, with, lower, albedo, such, as, grass, soil, or, ocean, the, effect, is, reversed, the, darkening, surface, lowers, albedo, increasing, local, temperatures, which, induces, more, melting, and, thus, reducing, the, albedo, further, resulting, in, still, more, heating, snow, albedo, is, highly, variable, ranging, from, as, high, as, 0, 9, for, freshly, fallen, snow, to, about, 0, 4, for, melting, snow, and, as, low, as, 0, 2, for, dirty, snow, over, antarctica, snow, albedo, averages, a, little, more, than, 0, 8, if, a, marginally, snow, covered, area, warms, snow, tends, to, melt, lowering, the, albedo, and, hence, leading, to, more, snowmelt, because, more, radiation, is, being, absorbed, by, the, snowpack, the, ice, albedo, positive, feedback, in, switzerland, the, citizens, have, been, protecting, their, glaciers, with, large, white, tarpaulins, to, slow, down, the, ice, melt, these, large, white, sheets, are, helping, to, reject, the, rays, from, the, sun, and, defecting, the, heat, although, that, this, method, is, very, expensive, it, has, shown, to, work, by, reducing, snow, and, ice, melt, by, 60, just, as, fresh, snow, has, a, higher, albedo, than, does, dirty, snow, the, albedo, of, snow, covered, sea, ice, is, far, higher, than, that, of, sea, water, sea, water, absorbs, more, solar, radiation, than, would, the, same, surface, covered, with, reflective, snow, when, sea, ice, melts, either, due, to, a, rise, in, sea, temperature, or, in, response, to, increased, solar, radiation, from, above, the, snow, covered, surface, is, reduced, and, more, surface, of, sea, water, is, exposed, so, the, rate, of, energy, absorption, increases, the, extra, absorbed, energy, heats, the, sea, water, which, in, turn, increases, the, rate, at, which, sea, ice, melts, as, with, the, preceding, example, of, snowmelt, the, process, of, melting, of, sea, ice, is, thus, another, example, of, a, positive, feedback, both, positive, feedback, loops, have, long, been, recognized, as, important, for, global, warming, cryoconite, powdery, windblown, dust, containing, soot, sometimes, reduces, albedo, on, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, the, dynamical, nature, of, albedo, in, response, to, positive, feedback, together, with, the, effects, of, small, errors, in, the, measurement, of, albedo, can, lead, to, large, errors, in, energy, estimates, because, of, this, in, order, to, reduce, the, error, of, energy, estimates, it, is, important, to, measure, the, albedo, of, snow, covered, areas, through, remote, sensing, techniques, rather, than, applying, a, single, value, for, albedo, over, broad, regions, albedo, works, on, a, smaller, scale, too, in, sunlight, dark, clothes, absorb, more, heat, and, light, coloured, clothes, reflect, it, better, thus, allowing, some, control, over, body, temperature, by, exploiting, the, albedo, effect, of, the, colour, of, external, clothing, albedo, can, affect, the, electrical, energy, output, of, solar, photovoltaic, devices, for, example, the, effects, of, a, spectrally, responsive, albedo, are, illustrated, by, the, differences, between, the, spectrally, weighted, albedo, of, solar, photovoltaic, technology, based, on, hydrogenated, amorphous, silicon, a, si, h, and, crystalline, silicon, c, si, based, compared, to, traditional, spectral, integrated, albedo, predictions, research, showed, impacts, of, over, 10, for, vertically, 90, mounted, systems, but, such, effects, were, substantially, lower, for, systems, with, lower, surface, tilts, spectral, albedo, strongly, affects, the, performance, of, bifacial, solar, cells, where, rear, surface, performance, gains, of, over, 20, have, been, observed, for, c, si, cells, installed, above, healthy, vegetation, an, analysis, on, the, bias, due, to, the, specular, reflectivity, of, 22, commonly, occurring, surface, materials, both, human, made, and, natural, provided, effective, albedo, values, for, simulating, the, performance, of, seven, photovoltaic, materials, mounted, on, three, common, photovoltaic, system, topologies, industrial, solar, farms, commercial, flat, rooftops, and, residential, pitched, roof, applications, forests, generally, have, a, low, albedo, because, the, majority, of, the, ultraviolet, and, visible, spectrum, is, absorbed, through, photosynthesis, for, this, reason, the, greater, heat, absorption, by, trees, could, offset, some, of, the, carbon, benefits, of, afforestation, or, offset, the, negative, climate, impacts, of, deforestation, in, other, words, the, climate, change, mitigation, effect, of, carbon, sequestration, by, forests, is, partially, counterbalanced, in, that, reforestation, can, decrease, the, reflection, of, sunlight, albedo, in, the, case, of, evergreen, forests, with, seasonal, snow, cover, albedo, reduction, may, be, significant, enough, for, deforestation, to, cause, a, net, cooling, effect, trees, also, impact, climate, in, extremely, complicated, ways, through, evapotranspiration, the, water, vapor, causes, cooling, on, the, land, surface, causes, heating, where, it, condenses, acts, as, strong, greenhouse, gas, and, can, increase, albedo, when, it, condenses, into, clouds, scientists, generally, treat, evapotranspiration, as, a, net, cooling, impact, and, the, net, climate, impact, of, albedo, and, evapotranspiration, changes, from, deforestation, depends, greatly, on, local, climate, mid, to, high, latitude, forests, have, a, much, lower, albedo, during, snow, seasons, than, flat, ground, thus, contributing, to, warming, modeling, that, compares, the, effects, of, albedo, differences, between, forests, and, grasslands, suggests, that, expanding, the, land, area, of, forests, in, temperate, zones, offers, only, a, temporary, mitigation, benefit, in, seasonally, snow, covered, zones, winter, albedos, of, treeless, areas, are, 10, to, 50, higher, than, nearby, forested, areas, because, snow, does, not, cover, the, trees, as, readily, deciduous, trees, have, an, albedo, value, of, about, 0, 15, to, 0, 18, whereas, coniferous, trees, have, a, value, of, about, 0, 09, to, 0, 15, variation, in, summer, albedo, across, both, forest, types, is, associated, with, maximum, rates, of, photosynthesis, because, plants, with, high, growth, capacity, display, a, greater, fraction, of, their, foliage, for, direct, interception, of, incoming, radiation, in, the, upper, canopy, the, result, is, that, wavelengths, of, light, not, used, in, photosynthesis, are, more, likely, to, be, reflected, back, to, space, rather, than, being, absorbed, by, other, surfaces, lower, in, the, canopy, studies, by, the, hadley, centre, have, investigated, the, relative, generally, warming, effect, of, albedo, change, and, cooling, effect, of, carbon, sequestration, on, planting, forests, they, found, that, new, forests, in, tropical, and, midlatitude, areas, tended, to, cool, new, forests, in, high, latitudes, e, g, siberia, were, neutral, or, perhaps, warming, research, in, 2023, drawing, from, 176, flux, stations, globally, revealed, a, climate, trade, off, increased, carbon, uptake, from, afforestation, results, in, reduced, albedo, initially, this, reduction, may, lead, to, moderate, global, warming, over, a, span, of, approximately, 20, years, but, it, is, expected, to, transition, into, significant, cooling, thereafter, water, reflects, light, very, differently, from, typical, terrestrial, materials, the, reflectivity, of, a, water, surface, is, calculated, using, the, fresnel, equations, at, the, scale, of, the, wavelength, of, light, even, wavy, water, is, always, smooth, so, the, light, is, reflected, in, a, locally, specular, manner, not, diffusely, the, glint, of, light, off, water, is, a, commonplace, effect, of, this, at, small, angles, of, incident, light, waviness, results, in, reduced, reflectivity, because, of, the, steepness, of, the, reflectivity, vs, incident, angle, curve, and, a, locally, increased, average, incident, angle, although, the, reflectivity, of, water, is, very, low, at, low, and, medium, angles, of, incident, light, it, becomes, very, high, at, high, angles, of, incident, light, such, as, those, that, occur, on, the, illuminated, side, of, earth, near, the, terminator, early, morning, late, afternoon, and, near, the, poles, however, as, mentioned, above, waviness, causes, an, appreciable, reduction, because, light, specularly, reflected, from, water, does, not, usually, reach, the, viewer, water, is, usually, considered, to, have, a, very, low, albedo, in, spite, of, its, high, reflectivity, at, high, angles, of, incident, light, note, that, white, caps, on, waves, look, white, and, have, high, albedo, because, the, water, is, foamed, up, so, there, are, many, superimposed, bubble, surfaces, which, reflect, adding, up, their, reflectivities, fresh, black, ice, exhibits, fresnel, reflection, snow, on, top, of, this, sea, ice, increases, the, albedo, to, 0, 9, cloud, albedo, has, substantial, influence, over, atmospheric, temperatures, different, types, of, clouds, exhibit, different, reflectivity, theoretically, ranging, in, albedo, from, a, minimum, of, near, 0, to, a, maximum, approaching, 0, 8, on, any, given, day, about, half, of, earth, is, covered, by, clouds, which, reflect, more, sunlight, than, land, and, water, clouds, keep, earth, cool, by, reflecting, sunlight, but, they, can, also, serve, as, blankets, to, trap, warmth, albedo, and, climate, in, some, areas, are, affected, by, artificial, clouds, such, as, those, created, by, the, contrails, of, heavy, commercial, airliner, traffic, a, study, following, the, burning, of, the, kuwaiti, oil, fields, during, iraqi, occupation, showed, that, temperatures, under, the, burning, oil, fires, were, as, much, as, 10, c, 18, f, colder, than, temperatures, several, miles, away, under, clear, skies, aerosols, very, fine, particles, droplets, in, the, atmosphere, have, both, direct, and, indirect, effects, on, earth, s, radiative, balance, the, direct, albedo, effect, is, generally, to, cool, the, planet, the, indirect, effect, the, particles, act, as, cloud, condensation, nuclei, and, thereby, change, cloud, properties, is, less, certain, another, albedo, related, effect, on, the, climate, is, from, black, carbon, particles, the, size, of, this, effect, is, difficult, to, quantify, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, estimates, that, the, global, mean, radiative, forcing, for, black, carbon, aerosols, from, fossil, fuels, is, 0, 2, w, m, 2, with, a, range, 0, 1, to, 0, 4, w, m, 2, black, carbon, is, a, bigger, cause, of, the, melting, of, the, polar, ice, cap, in, the, arctic, than, carbon, dioxide, due, to, its, effect, on, the, albedo, in, astronomy, the, term, albedo, can, be, defined, in, several, different, ways, depending, upon, the, application, and, the, wavelength, of, electromagnetic, radiation, involved, the, albedos, of, planets, satellites, and, minor, planets, such, as, asteroids, can, be, used, to, infer, much, about, their, properties, the, study, of, albedos, their, dependence, on, wavelength, lighting, angle, phase, angle, and, variation, in, time, composes, a, major, part, of, the, astronomical, field, of, photometry, for, small, and, far, objects, that, cannot, be, resolved, by, telescopes, much, of, what, we, know, comes, from, the, study, of, their, albedos, for, example, the, absolute, albedo, can, indicate, the, surface, ice, content, of, outer, solar, system, objects, the, variation, of, albedo, with, phase, angle, gives, information, about, regolith, properties, whereas, unusually, high, radar, albedo, is, indicative, of, high, metal, content, in, asteroids, enceladus, a, moon, of, saturn, has, one, of, the, highest, known, optical, albedos, of, any, body, in, the, solar, system, with, an, albedo, of, 0, 99, another, notable, high, albedo, body, is, eris, with, an, albedo, of, 0, 96, many, small, objects, in, the, outer, solar, system, and, asteroid, belt, have, low, albedos, down, to, about, 0, 05, a, typical, comet, nucleus, has, an, albedo, of, 0, 04, such, a, dark, surface, is, thought, to, be, indicative, of, a, primitive, and, heavily, space, weathered, surface, containing, some, organic, compounds, the, overall, albedo, of, the, moon, is, measured, to, be, around, 0, 14, but, it, is, strongly, directional, and, non, lambertian, displaying, also, a, strong, opposition, effect, although, such, reflectance, properties, are, different, from, those, of, any, terrestrial, terrains, they, are, typical, of, the, regolith, surfaces, of, airless, solar, system, bodies, two, common, optical, albedos, that, are, used, in, astronomy, are, the, v, band, geometric, albedo, measuring, brightness, when, illumination, comes, from, directly, behind, the, observer, and, the, bond, albedo, measuring, total, proportion, of, electromagnetic, energy, reflected, their, values, can, differ, significantly, which, is, a, common, source, of, confusion, in, detailed, studies, the, directional, reflectance, properties, of, astronomical, bodies, are, often, expressed, in, terms, of, the, five, hapke, parameters, which, semi, empirically, describe, the, variation, of, albedo, with, phase, angle, including, a, characterization, of, the, opposition, effect, of, regolith, surfaces, one, of, these, five, parameters, is, yet, another, type, of, albedo, called, the, single, scattering, albedo, it, is, used, to, define, scattering, of, electromagnetic, waves, on, small, particles, it, depends, on, properties, of, the, material, refractive, index, the, size, of, the, particle, and, the, wavelength, of, the, incoming, radiation, an, important, relationship, between, an, object, s, astronomical, geometric, albedo, absolute, magnitude, and, diameter, is, given, by, a, 1329, 10, h, 5, d, 2, displaystyle, a, left, frac, 1329, times, 10, h, 5, d, right, 2, where, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, astronomical, albedo, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, diameter, in, kilometers, and, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, absolute, magnitude, in, planetary, radar, astronomy, a, microwave, or, radar, pulse, is, transmitted, toward, a, planetary, target, e, g, moon, asteroid, etc, and, the, echo, from, the, target, is, measured, in, most, instances, the, transmitted, pulse, is, circularly, polarized, and, the, received, pulse, is, measured, in, the, same, sense, of, polarization, as, the, transmitted, pulse, sc, and, the, opposite, sense, oc, the, echo, power, is, measured, in, terms, of, radar, cross, section, o, c, displaystyle, sigma, oc, s, c, displaystyle, sigma, sc, or, t, displaystyle, sigma, t, total, power, sc, oc, and, is, equal, to, the, cross, sectional, area, of, a, metallic, sphere, perfect, reflector, at, the, same, distance, as, the, target, that, would, return, the, same, echo, power, those, components, of, the, received, echo, that, return, from, first, surface, reflections, as, from, a, smooth, or, mirror, like, surface, are, dominated, by, the, oc, component, as, there, is, a, reversal, in, polarization, upon, reflection, if, the, surface, is, rough, at, the, wavelength, scale, or, there, is, significant, penetration, into, the, regolith, there, will, be, a, significant, sc, component, in, the, echo, caused, by, multiple, scattering, for, most, objects, in, the, solar, system, the, oc, echo, dominates, and, the, most, commonly, reported, radar, albedo, parameter, is, the, normalized, oc, radar, albedo, often, shortened, to, radar, albedo, oc, oc, r, 2, displaystyle, hat, sigma, text, oc, frac, sigma, text, oc, pi, r, 2,
