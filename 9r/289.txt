a, polymer, is, a, substance, composed, of, macromolecules, a, macromolecule, is, a, molecule, of, high, relative, molecular, mass, the, structure, of, which, essentially, comprises, the, multiple, repetition, of, units, derived, actually, or, conceptually, from, molecules, of, low, relative, molecular, mass, a, polymer, p, l, m, r, is, a, substance, or, material, that, consists, of, very, large, molecules, or, macromolecules, that, are, constituted, by, many, repeating, subunits, derived, from, one, or, more, species, of, monomers, due, to, their, broad, spectrum, of, properties, both, synthetic, and, natural, polymers, play, essential, and, ubiquitous, roles, in, everyday, life, polymers, range, from, familiar, synthetic, plastics, such, as, polystyrene, to, natural, biopolymers, such, as, dna, and, proteins, that, are, fundamental, to, biological, structure, and, function, polymers, both, natural, and, synthetic, are, created, via, polymerization, of, many, small, molecules, known, as, monomers, their, consequently, large, molecular, mass, relative, to, small, molecule, compounds, produces, unique, physical, properties, including, toughness, high, elasticity, viscoelasticity, and, a, tendency, to, form, amorphous, and, semicrystalline, structures, rather, than, crystals, polymers, are, studied, in, the, fields, of, polymer, science, which, includes, polymer, chemistry, and, polymer, physics, biophysics, and, materials, science, and, engineering, historically, products, arising, from, the, linkage, of, repeating, units, by, covalent, chemical, bonds, have, been, the, primary, focus, of, polymer, science, an, emerging, important, area, now, focuses, on, supramolecular, polymers, formed, by, non, covalent, links, polyisoprene, of, latex, rubber, is, an, example, of, a, natural, polymer, and, the, polystyrene, of, styrofoam, is, an, example, of, a, synthetic, polymer, in, biological, contexts, essentially, all, biological, macromolecules, i, e, proteins, polyamides, nucleic, acids, polynucleotides, and, polysaccharides, are, purely, polymeric, or, are, composed, in, large, part, of, polymeric, components, the, term, polymer, derives, from, greek, polus, many, much, and, meros, part, the, term, was, coined, in, 1833, by, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, though, with, a, definition, distinct, from, the, modern, iupac, definition, the, modern, concept, of, polymers, as, covalently, bonded, macromolecular, structures, was, proposed, in, 1920, by, hermann, staudinger, who, spent, the, next, decade, finding, experimental, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, polymers, are, of, two, types, naturally, occurring, and, synthetic, or, man, made, natural, polymeric, materials, such, as, hemp, shellac, amber, wool, silk, and, natural, rubber, have, been, used, for, centuries, a, variety, of, other, natural, polymers, exist, such, as, cellulose, which, is, the, main, constituent, of, wood, and, paper, hemoglycin, previously, termed, hemolithin, is, a, space, polymer, that, is, the, first, polymer, of, amino, acids, found, in, meteorites, the, list, of, synthetic, polymers, roughly, in, order, of, worldwide, demand, includes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl, chloride, synthetic, rubber, phenol, formaldehyde, resin, or, bakelite, neoprene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile, pvb, silicone, and, many, more, more, than, 330, million, tons, of, these, polymers, are, made, every, year, 2015, most, commonly, the, continuously, linked, backbone, of, a, polymer, used, for, the, preparation, of, plastics, consists, mainly, of, carbon, atoms, a, simple, example, is, polyethylene, polythene, in, british, english, whose, repeat, unit, or, monomer, is, ethylene, many, other, structures, do, exist, for, example, elements, such, as, silicon, form, familiar, materials, such, as, silicones, examples, being, silly, putty, and, waterproof, plumbing, sealant, oxygen, is, also, commonly, present, in, polymer, backbones, such, as, those, of, polyethylene, glycol, polysaccharides, in, glycosidic, bonds, and, dna, in, phosphodiester, bonds, polymerization, is, the, process, of, combining, many, small, molecules, known, as, monomers, into, a, covalently, bonded, chain, or, network, during, the, polymerization, process, some, chemical, groups, may, be, lost, from, each, monomer, this, happens, in, the, polymerization, of, pet, polyester, the, monomers, are, terephthalic, acid, hooc, c, 6, h, 4, cooh, and, ethylene, glycol, ho, ch, 2, ch, 2, oh, but, the, repeating, unit, is, oc, c, 6, h, 4, coo, ch, 2, ch, 2, o, which, corresponds, to, the, combination, of, the, two, monomers, with, the, loss, of, two, water, molecules, the, distinct, piece, of, each, monomer, that, is, incorporated, into, the, polymer, is, known, as, a, repeat, unit, or, monomer, residue, synthetic, methods, are, generally, divided, into, two, categories, step, growth, polymerization, and, chain, polymerization, the, essential, difference, between, the, two, is, that, in, chain, polymerization, monomers, are, added, to, the, chain, one, at, a, time, only, such, as, in, polystyrene, whereas, in, step, growth, polymerization, chains, of, monomers, may, combine, with, one, another, directly, such, as, in, polyester, step, growth, polymerization, can, be, divided, into, polycondensation, in, which, low, molar, mass, by, product, is, formed, in, every, reaction, step, and, polyaddition, newer, methods, such, as, plasma, polymerization, do, not, fit, neatly, into, either, category, synthetic, polymerization, reactions, may, be, carried, out, with, or, without, a, catalyst, laboratory, synthesis, of, biopolymers, especially, of, proteins, is, an, area, of, intensive, research, there, are, three, main, classes, of, biopolymers, polysaccharides, polypeptides, and, polynucleotides, in, living, cells, they, may, be, synthesized, by, enzyme, mediated, processes, such, as, the, formation, of, dna, catalyzed, by, dna, polymerase, the, synthesis, of, proteins, involves, multiple, enzyme, mediated, processes, to, transcribe, genetic, information, from, the, dna, to, rna, and, subsequently, translate, that, information, to, synthesize, the, specified, protein, from, amino, acids, the, protein, may, be, modified, further, following, translation, in, order, to, provide, appropriate, structure, and, functioning, there, are, other, biopolymers, such, as, rubber, suberin, melanin, and, lignin, naturally, occurring, polymers, such, as, cotton, starch, and, rubber, were, familiar, materials, for, years, before, synthetic, polymers, such, as, polyethene, and, perspex, appeared, on, the, market, many, commercially, important, polymers, are, synthesized, by, chemical, modification, of, naturally, occurring, polymers, prominent, examples, include, the, reaction, of, nitric, acid, and, cellulose, to, form, nitrocellulose, and, the, formation, of, vulcanized, rubber, by, heating, natural, rubber, in, the, presence, of, sulfur, ways, in, which, polymers, can, be, modified, include, oxidation, cross, linking, and, end, capping, the, structure, of, a, polymeric, material, can, be, described, at, different, length, scales, from, the, sub, nm, length, scale, up, to, the, macroscopic, one, there, is, in, fact, a, hierarchy, of, structures, in, which, each, stage, provides, the, foundations, for, the, next, one, the, starting, point, for, the, description, of, the, structure, of, a, polymer, is, the, identity, of, its, constituent, monomers, next, the, microstructure, essentially, describes, the, arrangement, of, these, monomers, within, the, polymer, at, the, scale, of, a, single, chain, the, microstructure, determines, the, possibility, for, the, polymer, to, form, phases, with, different, arrangements, for, example, through, crystallization, the, glass, transition, or, microphase, separation, these, features, play, a, major, role, in, determining, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, a, polymer, the, identity, of, the, repeat, units, monomer, residues, also, known, as, mers, comprising, a, polymer, is, its, first, and, most, important, attribute, polymer, nomenclature, is, generally, based, upon, the, type, of, monomer, residues, comprising, the, polymer, a, polymer, which, contains, only, a, single, type, of, repeat, unit, is, known, as, a, homopolymer, while, a, polymer, containing, two, or, more, types, of, repeat, units, is, known, as, a, copolymer, a, terpolymer, is, a, copolymer, which, contains, three, types, of, repeat, units, polystyrene, is, composed, only, of, styrene, based, repeat, units, and, is, classified, as, a, homopolymer, polyethylene, terephthalate, even, though, produced, from, two, different, monomers, ethylene, glycol, and, terephthalic, acid, is, usually, regarded, as, a, homopolymer, because, only, one, type, of, repeat, unit, is, formed, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, contains, more, than, one, variety, of, repeat, unit, and, is, a, copolymer, some, biological, polymers, are, composed, of, a, variety, of, different, but, structurally, related, monomer, residues, for, example, polynucleotides, such, as, dna, are, composed, of, four, types, of, nucleotide, subunits, a, polymer, containing, ionizable, subunits, e, g, pendant, carboxylic, groups, is, known, as, a, polyelectrolyte, or, ionomer, when, the, fraction, of, ionizable, units, is, large, or, small, respectively, the, microstructure, of, a, polymer, sometimes, called, configuration, relates, to, the, physical, arrangement, of, monomer, residues, along, the, backbone, of, the, chain, these, are, the, elements, of, polymer, structure, that, require, the, breaking, of, a, covalent, bond, in, order, to, change, various, polymer, structures, can, be, produced, depending, on, the, monomers, and, reaction, conditions, a, polymer, may, consist, of, linear, macromolecules, containing, each, only, one, unbranched, chain, in, the, case, of, unbranched, polyethylene, this, chain, is, a, long, chain, n, alkane, there, are, also, branched, macromolecules, with, a, main, chain, and, side, chains, in, the, case, of, polyethylene, the, side, chains, would, be, alkyl, groups, in, particular, unbranched, macromolecules, can, be, in, the, solid, state, semi, crystalline, crystalline, chain, sections, highlighted, red, in, the, figure, below, while, branched, and, unbranched, polymers, are, usually, thermoplastics, many, elastomers, have, a, wide, meshed, cross, linking, between, the, main, chains, close, meshed, crosslinking, on, the, other, hand, leads, to, thermosets, cross, links, and, branches, are, shown, as, red, dots, in, the, figures, highly, branched, polymers, are, amorphous, and, the, molecules, in, the, solid, interact, randomly, an, important, microstructural, feature, of, a, polymer, is, its, architecture, and, shape, which, relates, to, the, way, branch, points, lead, to, a, deviation, from, a, simple, linear, chain, a, branched, polymer, molecule, is, composed, of, a, main, chain, with, one, or, more, substituent, side, chains, or, branches, types, of, branched, polymers, include, star, polymers, comb, polymers, polymer, brushes, dendronized, polymers, ladder, polymers, and, dendrimers, there, exist, also, two, dimensional, polymers, 2dp, which, are, composed, of, topologically, planar, repeat, units, a, polymer, s, architecture, affects, many, of, its, physical, properties, including, solution, viscosity, melt, viscosity, solubility, in, various, solvents, glass, transition, temperature, and, the, size, of, individual, polymer, coils, in, solution, a, variety, of, techniques, may, be, employed, for, the, synthesis, of, a, polymeric, material, with, a, range, of, architectures, for, example, living, polymerization, a, common, means, of, expressing, the, length, of, a, chain, is, the, degree, of, polymerization, which, quantifies, the, number, of, monomers, incorporated, into, the, chain, as, with, other, molecules, a, polymer, s, size, may, also, be, expressed, in, terms, of, molecular, weight, since, synthetic, polymerization, techniques, typically, yield, a, statistical, distribution, of, chain, lengths, the, molecular, weight, is, expressed, in, terms, of, weighted, averages, the, number, average, molecular, weight, m, n, and, weight, average, molecular, weight, m, w, are, most, commonly, reported, the, ratio, of, these, two, values, m, w, m, n, is, the, dispersity, which, is, commonly, used, to, express, the, width, of, the, molecular, weight, distribution, the, physical, properties, of, polymer, strongly, depend, on, the, length, or, equivalently, the, molecular, weight, of, the, polymer, chain, one, important, example, of, the, physical, consequences, of, the, molecular, weight, is, the, scaling, of, the, viscosity, resistance, to, flow, in, the, melt, the, influence, of, the, weight, average, molecular, weight, m, w, displaystyle, m, w, on, the, melt, viscosity, displaystyle, eta, depends, on, whether, the, polymer, is, above, or, below, the, onset, of, entanglements, below, the, entanglement, molecular, weight, m, w, 1, displaystyle, eta, sim, m, w, 1, whereas, above, the, entanglement, molecular, weight, m, w, 3, 4, displaystyle, eta, sim, m, w, 3, 4, in, the, latter, case, increasing, the, polymer, chain, length, 10, fold, would, increase, the, viscosity, over, 1000, times, increasing, chain, length, furthermore, tends, to, decrease, chain, mobility, increase, strength, and, toughness, and, increase, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, this, is, a, result, of, the, increase, in, chain, interactions, such, as, van, der, waals, attractions, and, entanglements, that, come, with, increased, chain, length, these, interactions, tend, to, fix, the, individual, chains, more, strongly, in, position, and, resist, deformations, and, matrix, breakup, both, at, higher, stresses, and, higher, temperatures, copolymers, are, classified, either, as, statistical, copolymers, alternating, copolymers, block, copolymers, graft, copolymers, or, gradient, copolymers, in, the, schematic, figure, below, and, symbolize, the, two, repeat, units, monomers, within, a, copolymer, may, be, organized, along, the, backbone, in, a, variety, of, ways, a, copolymer, containing, a, controlled, arrangement, of, monomers, is, called, a, sequence, controlled, polymer, alternating, periodic, and, block, copolymers, are, simple, examples, of, sequence, controlled, polymers, tacticity, describes, the, relative, stereochemistry, of, chiral, centers, in, neighboring, structural, units, within, a, macromolecule, there, are, three, types, of, tacticity, isotactic, all, substituents, on, the, same, side, atactic, random, placement, of, substituents, and, syndiotactic, alternating, placement, of, substituents, polymer, morphology, generally, describes, the, arrangement, and, microscale, ordering, of, polymer, chains, in, space, the, macroscopic, physical, properties, of, a, polymer, are, related, to, the, interactions, between, the, polymer, chains, when, applied, to, polymers, the, term, crystalline, has, a, somewhat, ambiguous, usage, in, some, cases, the, term, crystalline, finds, identical, usage, to, that, used, in, conventional, crystallography, for, example, the, structure, of, a, crystalline, protein, or, polynucleotide, such, as, a, sample, prepared, for, x, ray, crystallography, may, be, defined, in, terms, of, a, conventional, unit, cell, composed, of, one, or, more, polymer, molecules, with, cell, dimensions, of, hundreds, of, angstroms, or, more, a, synthetic, polymer, may, be, loosely, described, as, crystalline, if, it, contains, regions, of, three, dimensional, ordering, on, atomic, rather, than, macromolecular, length, scales, usually, arising, from, intramolecular, folding, or, stacking, of, adjacent, chains, synthetic, polymers, may, consist, of, both, crystalline, and, amorphous, regions, the, degree, of, crystallinity, may, be, expressed, in, terms, of, a, weight, fraction, or, volume, fraction, of, crystalline, material, few, synthetic, polymers, are, entirely, crystalline, the, crystallinity, of, polymers, is, characterized, by, their, degree, of, crystallinity, ranging, from, zero, for, a, completely, non, crystalline, polymer, to, one, for, a, theoretical, completely, crystalline, polymer, polymers, with, microcrystalline, regions, are, generally, tougher, can, be, bent, more, without, breaking, and, more, impact, resistant, than, totally, amorphous, polymers, polymers, with, a, degree, of, crystallinity, approaching, zero, or, one, will, tend, to, be, transparent, while, polymers, with, intermediate, degrees, of, crystallinity, will, tend, to, be, opaque, due, to, light, scattering, by, crystalline, or, glassy, regions, for, many, polymers, crystallinity, may, also, be, associated, with, decreased, transparency, the, space, occupied, by, a, polymer, molecule, is, generally, expressed, in, terms, of, radius, of, gyration, which, is, an, average, distance, from, the, center, of, mass, of, the, chain, to, the, chain, itself, alternatively, it, may, be, expressed, in, terms, of, pervaded, volume, which, is, the, volume, spanned, by, the, polymer, chain, and, scales, with, the, cube, of, the, radius, of, gyration, the, simplest, theoretical, models, for, polymers, in, the, molten, amorphous, state, are, ideal, chains, polymer, properties, depend, of, their, structure, and, they, are, divided, into, classes, according, to, their, physical, bases, many, physical, and, chemical, properties, describe, how, a, polymer, behaves, as, a, continuous, macroscopic, material, they, are, classified, as, bulk, properties, or, intensive, properties, according, to, thermodynamics, the, bulk, properties, of, a, polymer, are, those, most, often, of, end, use, interest, these, are, the, properties, that, dictate, how, the, polymer, actually, behaves, on, a, macroscopic, scale, the, tensile, strength, of, a, material, quantifies, how, much, elongating, stress, the, material, will, endure, before, failure, this, is, very, important, in, applications, that, rely, upon, a, polymer, s, physical, strength, or, durability, for, example, a, rubber, band, with, a, higher, tensile, strength, will, hold, a, greater, weight, before, snapping, in, general, tensile, strength, increases, with, polymer, chain, length, and, crosslinking, of, polymer, chains, young, s, modulus, quantifies, the, elasticity, of, the, polymer, it, is, defined, for, small, strains, as, the, ratio, of, rate, of, change, of, stress, to, strain, like, tensile, strength, this, is, highly, relevant, in, polymer, applications, involving, the, physical, properties, of, polymers, such, as, rubber, bands, the, modulus, is, strongly, dependent, on, temperature, viscoelasticity, describes, a, complex, time, dependent, elastic, response, which, will, exhibit, hysteresis, in, the, stress, strain, curve, when, the, load, is, removed, dynamic, mechanical, analysis, or, dma, measures, this, complex, modulus, by, oscillating, the, load, and, measuring, the, resulting, strain, as, a, function, of, time, transport, properties, such, as, diffusivity, describe, how, rapidly, molecules, move, through, the, polymer, matrix, these, are, very, important, in, many, applications, of, polymers, for, films, and, membranes, the, movement, of, individual, macromolecules, occurs, by, a, process, called, reptation, in, which, each, chain, molecule, is, constrained, by, entanglements, with, neighboring, chains, to, move, within, a, virtual, tube, the, theory, of, reptation, can, explain, polymer, molecule, dynamics, and, viscoelasticity, depending, on, their, chemical, structures, polymers, may, be, either, semi, crystalline, or, amorphous, semi, crystalline, polymers, can, undergo, crystallization, and, melting, transitions, whereas, amorphous, polymers, do, not, in, polymers, crystallization, and, melting, do, not, suggest, solid, liquid, phase, transitions, as, in, the, case, of, water, or, other, molecular, fluids, instead, crystallization, and, melting, refer, to, the, phase, transitions, between, two, solid, states, i, e, semi, crystalline, and, amorphous, crystallization, occurs, above, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, and, below, the, melting, temperature, t, m, all, polymers, amorphous, or, semi, crystalline, go, through, glass, transitions, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, is, a, crucial, physical, parameter, for, polymer, manufacturing, processing, and, use, below, t, g, molecular, motions, are, frozen, and, polymers, are, brittle, and, glassy, above, t, g, molecular, motions, are, activated, and, polymers, are, rubbery, and, viscous, the, glass, transition, temperature, may, be, engineered, by, altering, the, degree, of, branching, or, crosslinking, in, the, polymer, or, by, the, addition, of, plasticizers, whereas, crystallization, and, melting, are, first, order, phase, transitions, the, glass, transition, is, not, the, glass, transition, shares, features, of, second, order, phase, transitions, such, as, discontinuity, in, the, heat, capacity, as, shown, in, the, figure, but, it, is, generally, not, considered, a, thermodynamic, transition, between, equilibrium, states, in, general, polymeric, mixtures, are, far, less, miscible, than, mixtures, of, small, molecule, materials, this, effect, results, from, the, fact, that, the, driving, force, for, mixing, is, usually, entropy, not, interaction, energy, in, other, words, miscible, materials, usually, form, a, solution, not, because, their, interaction, with, each, other, is, more, favorable, than, their, self, interaction, but, because, of, an, increase, in, entropy, and, hence, free, energy, associated, with, increasing, the, amount, of, volume, available, to, each, component, this, increase, in, entropy, scales, with, the, number, of, particles, or, moles, being, mixed, since, polymeric, molecules, are, much, larger, and, hence, generally, have, much, higher, specific, volumes, than, small, molecules, the, number, of, molecules, involved, in, a, polymeric, mixture, is, far, smaller, than, the, number, in, a, small, molecule, mixture, of, equal, volume, the, energetics, of, mixing, on, the, other, hand, is, comparable, on, a, per, volume, basis, for, polymeric, and, small, molecule, mixtures, this, tends, to, increase, the, free, energy, of, mixing, for, polymer, solutions, and, thereby, making, solvation, less, favorable, and, thereby, making, the, availability, of, concentrated, solutions, of, polymers, far, rarer, than, those, of, small, molecules, furthermore, the, phase, behavior, of, polymer, solutions, and, mixtures, is, more, complex, than, that, of, small, molecule, mixtures, whereas, most, small, molecule, solutions, exhibit, only, an, upper, critical, solution, temperature, phase, transition, ucst, at, which, phase, separation, occurs, with, cooling, polymer, mixtures, commonly, exhibit, a, lower, critical, solution, temperature, phase, transition, lcst, at, which, phase, separation, occurs, with, heating, in, dilute, solutions, the, properties, of, the, polymer, are, characterized, by, the, interaction, between, the, solvent, and, the, polymer, in, a, good, solvent, the, polymer, appears, swollen, and, occupies, a, large, volume, in, this, scenario, intermolecular, forces, between, the, solvent, and, monomer, subunits, dominate, over, intramolecular, interactions, in, a, bad, solvent, or, poor, solvent, intramolecular, forces, dominate, and, the, chain, contracts, in, the, theta, solvent, or, the, state, of, the, polymer, solution, where, the, value, of, the, second, virial, coefficient, becomes, 0, the, intermolecular, polymer, solvent, repulsion, balances, exactly, the, intramolecular, monomer, monomer, attraction, under, the, theta, condition, also, called, the, flory, condition, the, polymer, behaves, like, an, ideal, random, coil, the, transition, between, the, states, is, known, as, a, coil, globule, transition, inclusion, of, plasticizers, tends, to, lower, t, g, and, increase, polymer, flexibility, addition, of, the, plasticizer, will, also, modify, dependence, of, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, on, the, cooling, rate, the, mobility, of, the, chain, can, further, change, if, the, molecules, of, plasticizer, give, rise, to, hydrogen, bonding, formation, plasticizers, are, generally, small, molecules, that, are, chemically, similar, to, the, polymer, and, create, gaps, between, polymer, chains, for, greater, mobility, and, fewer, interchain, interactions, a, good, example, of, the, action, of, plasticizers, is, related, to, polyvinylchlorides, or, pvcs, a, upvc, or, unplasticized, polyvinylchloride, is, used, for, things, such, as, pipes, a, pipe, has, no, plasticizers, in, it, because, it, needs, to, remain, strong, and, heat, resistant, plasticized, pvc, is, used, in, clothing, for, a, flexible, quality, plasticizers, are, also, put, in, some, types, of, cling, film, to, make, the, polymer, more, flexible, the, attractive, forces, between, polymer, chains, play, a, large, part, in, determining, the, polymer, s, properties, because, polymer, chains, are, so, long, they, have, many, such, interchain, interactions, per, molecule, amplifying, the, effect, of, these, interactions, on, the, polymer, properties, in, comparison, to, attractions, between, conventional, molecules, different, side, groups, on, the, polymer, can, lend, the, polymer, to, ionic, bonding, or, hydrogen, bonding, between, its, own, chains, these, stronger, forces, typically, result, in, higher, tensile, strength, and, higher, crystalline, melting, points, the, intermolecular, forces, in, polymers, can, be, affected, by, dipoles, in, the, monomer, units, polymers, containing, amide, or, carbonyl, groups, can, form, hydrogen, bonds, between, adjacent, chains, the, partially, positively, charged, hydrogen, atoms, in, n, h, groups, of, one, chain, are, strongly, attracted, to, the, partially, negatively, charged, oxygen, atoms, in, c, o, groups, on, another, these, strong, hydrogen, bonds, for, example, result, in, the, high, tensile, strength, and, melting, point, of, polymers, containing, urethane, or, urea, linkages, polyesters, have, dipole, dipole, bonding, between, the, oxygen, atoms, in, c, o, groups, and, the, hydrogen, atoms, in, h, c, groups, dipole, bonding, is, not, as, strong, as, hydrogen, bonding, so, a, polyester, s, melting, point, and, strength, are, lower, than, kevlar, s, twaron, but, polyesters, have, greater, flexibility, polymers, with, non, polar, units, such, as, polyethylene, interact, only, through, weak, van, der, waals, forces, as, a, result, they, typically, have, lower, melting, temperatures, than, other, polymers, when, a, polymer, is, dispersed, or, dissolved, in, a, liquid, such, as, in, commercial, products, like, paints, and, glues, the, chemical, properties, and, molecular, interactions, influence, how, the, solution, flows, and, can, even, lead, to, self, assembly, of, the, polymer, into, complex, structures, when, a, polymer, is, applied, as, a, coating, the, chemical, properties, will, influence, the, adhesion, of, the, coating, and, how, it, interacts, with, external, materials, such, as, superhydrophobic, polymer, coatings, leading, to, water, resistance, overall, the, chemical, properties, of, a, polymer, are, important, elements, for, designing, new, polymeric, material, products, polymers, such, as, pmma, and, hema, mma, are, used, as, matrices, in, the, gain, medium, of, solid, state, dye, lasers, also, known, as, solid, state, dye, doped, polymer, lasers, these, polymers, have, a, high, surface, quality, and, are, also, highly, transparent, so, that, the, laser, properties, are, dominated, by, the, laser, dye, used, to, dope, the, polymer, matrix, these, type, of, lasers, that, also, belong, to, the, class, of, organic, lasers, are, known, to, yield, very, narrow, linewidths, which, is, useful, for, spectroscopy, and, analytical, applications, an, important, optical, parameter, in, the, polymer, used, in, laser, applications, is, the, change, in, refractive, index, with, temperature, also, known, as, dn, dt, for, the, polymers, mentioned, here, the, dn, dt, 1, 4, 10, 4, in, units, of, k, 1, in, the, 297, t, 337, k, range, most, conventional, polymers, such, as, polyethylene, are, electrical, insulators, but, the, development, of, polymers, containing, conjugated, bonds, has, led, to, a, wealth, of, polymer, based, semiconductors, such, as, polythiophenes, this, has, led, to, many, applications, in, the, field, of, organic, electronics, nowadays, synthetic, polymers, are, used, in, almost, all, walks, of, life, modern, society, would, look, very, different, without, them, the, spreading, of, polymer, use, is, connected, to, their, unique, properties, low, density, low, cost, good, thermal, electrical, insulation, properties, high, resistance, to, corrosion, low, energy, demanding, polymer, manufacture, and, facile, processing, into, final, products, for, a, given, application, the, properties, of, a, polymer, can, be, tuned, or, enhanced, by, combination, with, other, materials, as, in, composites, their, application, allows, to, save, energy, lighter, cars, and, planes, thermally, insulated, buildings, protect, food, and, drinking, water, packaging, save, land, and, lower, use, of, fertilizers, synthetic, fibres, preserve, other, materials, coatings, protect, and, save, lives, hygiene, medical, applications, a, representative, non, exhaustive, list, of, applications, is, given, below, there, are, multiple, conventions, for, naming, polymer, substances, many, commonly, used, polymers, such, as, those, found, in, consumer, products, are, referred, to, by, a, common, or, trivial, name, the, trivial, name, is, assigned, based, on, historical, precedent, or, popular, usage, rather, than, a, standardized, naming, convention, both, the, american, chemical, society, acs, and, iupac, have, proposed, standardized, naming, conventions, the, acs, and, iupac, conventions, are, similar, but, not, identical, examples, of, the, differences, between, the, various, naming, conventions, are, given, in, the, table, below, in, both, standardized, conventions, the, polymers, names, are, intended, to, reflect, the, monomer, s, from, which, they, are, synthesized, source, based, nomenclature, rather, than, the, precise, nature, of, the, repeating, subunit, for, example, the, polymer, synthesized, from, the, simple, alkene, ethene, is, called, polyethene, retaining, the, ene, suffix, even, though, the, double, bond, is, removed, during, the, polymerization, process, however, iupac, structure, based, nomenclature, is, based, on, naming, of, the, preferred, constitutional, repeating, unit, polymer, characterization, spans, many, techniques, for, determining, the, chemical, composition, molecular, weight, distribution, and, physical, properties, select, common, techniques, include, the, following, polymer, degradation, is, a, change, in, the, properties, tensile, strength, color, shape, or, molecular, weight, of, a, polymer, or, polymer, based, product, under, the, influence, of, one, or, more, environmental, factors, such, as, heat, light, and, the, presence, of, certain, chemicals, oxygen, and, enzymes, this, change, in, properties, is, often, the, result, of, bond, breaking, in, the, polymer, backbone, chain, scission, which, may, occur, at, the, chain, ends, or, at, random, positions, in, the, chain, although, such, changes, are, frequently, undesirable, in, some, cases, such, as, biodegradation, and, recycling, they, may, be, intended, to, prevent, environmental, pollution, degradation, can, also, be, useful, in, biomedical, settings, for, example, a, copolymer, of, polylactic, acid, and, polyglycolic, acid, is, employed, in, hydrolysable, stitches, that, slowly, degrade, after, they, are, applied, to, a, wound, the, susceptibility, of, a, polymer, to, degradation, depends, on, its, structure, epoxies, and, chains, containing, aromatic, functionalities, are, especially, susceptible, to, uv, degradation, while, polyesters, are, susceptible, to, degradation, by, hydrolysis, polymers, containing, an, unsaturated, backbone, degrade, via, ozone, cracking, carbon, based, polymers, are, more, susceptible, to, thermal, degradation, than, inorganic, polymers, such, as, polydimethylsiloxane, and, are, therefore, not, ideal, for, most, high, temperature, applications, the, degradation, of, polyethylene, occurs, by, random, scission, a, random, breakage, of, the, bonds, that, hold, the, atoms, of, the, polymer, together, when, heated, above, 450, c, polyethylene, degrades, to, form, a, mixture, of, hydrocarbons, in, the, case, of, chain, end, scission, monomers, are, released, and, this, process, is, referred, to, as, unzipping, or, depolymerization, which, mechanism, dominates, will, depend, on, the, type, of, polymer, and, temperature, in, general, polymers, with, no, or, a, single, small, substituent, in, the, repeat, unit, will, decompose, via, random, chain, scission, the, sorting, of, polymer, waste, for, recycling, purposes, may, be, facilitated, by, the, use, of, the, resin, identification, codes, developed, by, the, society, of, the, plastics, industry, to, identify, the, type, of, plastic, failure, of, safety, critical, polymer, components, can, cause, serious, accidents, such, as, fire, in, the, case, of, cracked, and, degraded, polymer, fuel, lines, chlorine, induced, cracking, of, acetal, resin, plumbing, joints, and, polybutylene, pipes, has, caused, many, serious, floods, in, domestic, properties, especially, in, the, us, in, the, 1990s, traces, of, chlorine, in, the, water, supply, attacked, polymers, present, in, the, plumbing, a, problem, which, occurs, faster, if, any, of, the, parts, have, been, poorly, extruded, or, injection, molded, attack, of, the, acetal, joint, occurred, because, of, faulty, molding, leading, to, cracking, along, the, threads, of, the, fitting, where, there, is, stress, concentration, polymer, oxidation, has, caused, accidents, involving, medical, devices, one, of, the, oldest, known, failure, modes, is, ozone, cracking, caused, by, chain, scission, when, ozone, gas, attacks, susceptible, elastomers, such, as, natural, rubber, and, nitrile, rubber, they, possess, double, bonds, in, their, repeat, units, which, are, cleaved, during, ozonolysis, cracks, in, fuel, lines, can, penetrate, the, bore, of, the, tube, and, cause, fuel, leakage, if, cracking, occurs, in, the, engine, compartment, electric, sparks, can, ignite, the, gasoline, and, can, cause, a, serious, fire, in, medical, use, degradation, of, polymers, can, lead, to, changes, of, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, of, implantable, devices, nylon, 66, is, susceptible, to, acid, hydrolysis, and, in, one, accident, a, fractured, fuel, line, led, to, a, spillage, of, diesel, into, the, road, if, diesel, fuel, leaks, onto, the, road, accidents, to, following, cars, can, be, caused, by, the, slippery, nature, of, the, deposit, which, is, like, black, ice, furthermore, the, asphalt, concrete, road, surface, will, suffer, damage, as, a, result, of, the, diesel, fuel, dissolving, the, asphaltenes, from, the, composite, material, this, resulting, in, the, degradation, of, the, asphalt, surface, and, structural, integrity, of, the, road, polymers, have, been, essential, components, of, commodities, since, the, early, days, of, humankind, the, use, of, wool, keratin, cotton, and, linen, fibres, cellulose, for, garments, paper, reed, cellulose, for, paper, are, just, a, few, examples, of, how, ancient, societies, exploited, polymer, containing, raw, materials, to, obtain, artefacts, the, latex, sap, of, caoutchouc, trees, natural, rubber, reached, europe, in, the, 16th, century, from, south, america, long, after, the, olmec, maya, and, aztec, had, started, using, it, as, a, material, to, make, balls, waterproof, textiles, and, containers, the, chemical, manipulation, of, polymers, dates, back, to, the, 19th, century, although, at, the, time, the, nature, of, these, species, was, not, understood, the, behaviour, of, polymers, was, initially, rationalised, according, to, the, theory, proposed, by, thomas, graham, which, considered, them, as, colloidal, aggregates, of, small, molecules, held, together, by, unknown, forces, notwithstanding, the, lack, of, theoretical, knowledge, the, potential, of, polymers, to, provide, innovative, accessible, and, cheap, materials, was, immediately, grasped, the, work, carried, out, by, braconnot, parkes, ludersdorf, hayward, and, many, others, on, the, modification, of, natural, polymers, determined, many, significant, advances, in, the, field, their, contributions, led, to, the, discovery, of, materials, such, as, celluloid, galalith, parkesine, rayon, vulcanised, rubber, and, later, bakelite, all, materials, that, quickly, entered, industrial, manufacturing, processes, and, reached, households, as, garments, components, e, g, fabrics, buttons, crockery, and, decorative, items, in, 1920, hermann, staudinger, published, his, seminal, work, ber, polymerisation, in, which, he, proposed, that, polymers, were, in, fact, long, chains, of, atoms, linked, by, covalent, bonds, his, work, was, debated, at, length, but, eventually, it, was, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, because, of, this, work, staudinger, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1953, after, the, 1930s, polymers, entered, a, golden, age, during, which, new, types, were, discovered, and, quickly, given, commercial, applications, replacing, naturally, sourced, materials, this, development, was, fuelled, by, an, industrial, sector, with, a, strong, economic, drive, and, it, was, supported, by, a, broad, academic, community, that, contributed, innovative, syntheses, of, monomers, from, cheaper, raw, material, more, efficient, polymerisation, processes, improved, techniques, for, polymer, characterisation, and, advanced, theoretical, understanding, of, polymers, since, 1953, six, nobel, prizes, have, been, awarded, in, the, area, of, polymer, science, excluding, those, for, research, on, biological, macromolecules, this, further, testifies, to, its, impact, on, modern, science, and, technology, as, lord, todd, summarised, in, 1980, i, am, inclined, to, think, that, the, development, of, polymerization, is, perhaps, the, biggest, thing, that, chemistry, has, done, where, it, has, had, the, biggest, effect, on, everyday, life
