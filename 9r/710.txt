a, wetland, is, a, distinct, semi, aquatic, ecosystem, whose, groundcovers, are, flooded, or, saturated, in, water, either, permanently, for, years, or, decades, or, only, seasonally, for, a, shorter, periods, flooding, results, in, oxygen, poor, anoxic, processes, taking, place, especially, in, the, soils, wetlands, form, a, transitional, zone, between, waterbodies, and, dry, lands, and, are, different, from, other, terrestrial, or, aquatic, ecosystems, due, to, their, vegetation, s, roots, having, adapted, to, oxygen, poor, waterlogged, soils, they, are, considered, among, the, most, biologically, diverse, of, all, ecosystems, serving, as, habitats, to, a, wide, range, of, aquatic, and, semi, aquatic, plants, and, animals, with, often, improved, water, quality, by, the, plants, removing, excess, nutrients, such, as, nitrates, and, phosphates, wetlands, exist, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, the, water, in, wetlands, is, either, freshwater, brackish, or, saltwater, the, main, types, of, wetland, are, defined, based, on, the, dominant, plants, and, the, source, of, the, water, for, example, marshes, are, wetlands, dominated, by, emergent, herbaceous, vegetation, such, as, reeds, cattails, and, sedges, swamps, are, dominated, by, woody, vegetation, such, as, trees, and, shrubs, although, reed, swamps, in, europe, are, dominated, by, reeds, not, trees, mangrove, forest, are, wetlands, with, mangroves, halophytic, woody, plants, that, have, evolved, to, tolerate, salty, water, examples, of, wetlands, classified, by, the, sources, of, water, include, tidal, wetlands, where, the, water, source, is, ocean, tides, estuaries, water, source, is, mixed, tidal, and, river, waters, floodplains, water, source, is, excess, water, from, overflowed, rivers, or, lakes, and, bogs, and, vernal, ponds, water, source, is, rainfall, or, meltwater, the, world, s, largest, wetlands, include, the, amazon, river, basin, the, west, siberian, plain, the, pantanal, in, south, america, and, the, sundarbans, in, the, ganges, brahmaputra, delta, wetlands, contribute, many, ecosystem, services, that, benefit, people, these, include, for, example, water, purification, stabilization, of, shorelines, storm, protection, and, flood, control, in, addition, wetlands, also, process, and, condense, carbon, in, processes, called, carbon, fixation, and, sequestration, and, other, nutrients, and, water, pollutants, wetlands, can, act, as, a, sink, or, a, source, of, carbon, depending, on, the, specific, wetland, if, they, function, as, a, carbon, sink, they, can, help, with, climate, change, mitigation, however, wetlands, can, also, be, a, significant, source, of, methane, emissions, due, to, anaerobic, decomposition, of, soaked, detritus, and, some, are, also, emitters, of, nitrous, oxide, humans, are, disturbing, and, damaging, wetlands, for, example, by, oil, and, gas, extraction, building, infrastructure, overgrazing, of, livestock, overfishing, alteration, of, wetlands, including, dredging, and, draining, nutrient, pollution, and, water, pollution, environmental, degradation, threatens, wetlands, more, than, any, other, ecosystem, on, earth, according, to, the, millennium, ecosystem, assessment, from, 2005, methods, exist, for, assessing, wetland, ecological, health, these, methods, have, contributed, to, wetland, conservation, by, raising, public, awareness, of, the, functions, that, wetlands, can, provide, since, 1971, work, under, an, international, treaty, seeks, to, identify, and, protect, wetlands, of, international, importance, a, simplified, definition, of, wetland, is, an, area, of, land, that, is, usually, saturated, with, water, more, precisely, wetlands, are, areas, where, water, covers, the, soil, or, is, present, either, at, or, near, the, surface, of, the, soil, all, year, or, for, varying, periods, of, time, during, the, year, including, during, the, growing, season, a, patch, of, land, that, develops, pools, of, water, after, a, rain, storm, would, not, necessarily, be, considered, a, wetland, even, though, the, land, is, wet, wetlands, have, unique, characteristics, they, are, generally, distinguished, from, other, water, bodies, or, landforms, based, on, their, water, level, and, on, the, types, of, plants, that, live, within, them, specifically, wetlands, are, characterized, as, having, a, water, table, that, stands, at, or, near, the, land, surface, for, a, long, enough, period, each, year, to, support, aquatic, plants, a, more, concise, definition, is, a, community, composed, of, hydric, soil, and, hydrophytes, wetlands, have, also, been, described, as, ecotones, providing, a, transition, between, dry, land, and, water, bodies, wetlands, exist, at, the, interface, between, truly, terrestrial, ecosystems, and, aquatic, systems, making, them, inherently, different, from, each, other, yet, highly, dependent, on, both, in, environmental, decision, making, there, are, subsets, of, definitions, that, are, agreed, upon, to, make, regulatory, and, policy, decisions, under, the, ramsar, international, wetland, conservation, treaty, wetlands, are, defined, as, follows, an, ecological, definition, of, a, wetland, is, an, ecosystem, that, arises, when, inundation, by, water, produces, soils, dominated, by, anaerobic, and, aerobic, processes, which, in, turn, forces, the, biota, particularly, rooted, plants, to, adapt, to, flooding, sometimes, a, precise, legal, definition, of, a, wetland, is, required, the, definition, used, for, regulation, by, the, united, states, government, is, the, term, wetlands, means, those, areas, that, are, inundated, or, saturated, by, surface, or, ground, water, at, a, frequency, and, duration, to, support, and, that, under, normal, circumstances, do, support, a, prevalence, of, vegetation, typically, adapted, for, life, in, saturated, soil, conditions, wetlands, generally, included, swamps, marshes, bogs, and, similar, areas, for, each, of, these, definitions, and, others, regardless, of, the, purpose, hydrology, is, emphasized, shallow, waters, water, logged, soils, the, soil, characteristics, and, the, plants, and, animals, controlled, by, the, wetland, hydrology, are, often, additional, components, of, the, definitions, wetlands, can, be, tidal, inundated, by, tides, or, non, tidal, the, water, in, wetlands, is, either, freshwater, brackish, saline, or, alkaline, there, are, four, main, kinds, of, wetlands, marsh, swamp, bog, and, fen, bogs, and, fens, being, types, of, peatlands, or, mires, some, experts, also, recognize, wet, meadows, and, aquatic, ecosystems, as, additional, wetland, types, sub, types, include, mangrove, forests, carrs, pocosins, floodplains, peatlands, vernal, pools, sinks, and, many, others, the, following, three, groups, are, used, within, australia, to, classify, wetland, by, type, marine, and, coastal, zone, wetlands, inland, wetlands, and, human, made, wetlands, in, the, us, the, best, known, classifications, are, the, cowardin, classification, system, and, the, hydrogeomorphic, hgm, classification, system, the, cowardin, system, includes, five, main, types, of, wetlands, marine, ocean, associated, estuarine, mixed, ocean, and, river, associated, riverine, within, river, channels, lacustrine, lake, associated, and, palustrine, inland, nontidal, habitats, peatlands, are, a, unique, kind, of, wetland, where, lush, plant, growth, and, slow, decay, of, dead, plants, under, anoxic, conditions, results, in, organic, peat, accumulating, bogs, fens, and, mires, are, different, names, for, peatlands, variations, of, names, for, wetland, systems, some, wetlands, have, localized, names, unique, to, a, region, such, as, the, prairie, potholes, of, north, america, s, northern, plain, pocosins, carolina, bays, and, baygalls, of, the, southeastern, us, mallines, of, argentina, mediterranean, seasonal, ponds, of, europe, and, california, turloughs, of, ireland, billabongs, of, australia, among, many, others, wetlands, are, found, throughout, the, world, in, different, climates, temperatures, vary, greatly, depending, on, the, location, of, the, wetland, many, of, the, world, s, wetlands, are, in, the, temperate, zones, midway, between, the, north, or, south, poles, and, the, equator, in, these, zones, summers, are, warm, and, winters, are, cold, but, temperatures, are, not, extreme, in, subtropical, zone, wetlands, such, as, along, the, gulf, of, mexico, average, temperatures, might, be, 11, c, 52, f, wetlands, in, the, tropics, are, subjected, to, much, higher, temperatures, for, a, large, portion, of, the, year, temperatures, for, wetlands, on, the, arabian, peninsula, can, exceed, 50, c, 122, f, and, these, habitats, would, therefore, be, subject, to, rapid, evaporation, in, northeastern, siberia, which, has, a, polar, climate, wetland, temperatures, can, be, as, low, as, 50, c, 58, f, peatlands, in, arctic, and, subarctic, regions, insulate, the, permafrost, thus, delaying, or, preventing, its, thawing, during, summer, as, well, as, inducing, its, formation, the, amount, of, precipitation, a, wetland, receives, varies, widely, according, to, its, area, wetlands, in, wales, scotland, and, western, ireland, typically, receive, about, 1, 500, mm, 59, in, per, year, in, some, places, in, southeast, asia, where, heavy, rains, occur, they, can, receive, up, to, 10, 000, mm, 390, in, in, some, drier, regions, wetlands, exist, where, as, little, as, 180, mm, 7, 1, in, precipitation, occurs, each, year, temporal, variation, surface, flow, may, occur, in, some, segments, with, subsurface, flow, in, other, segments, wetlands, vary, widely, due, to, local, and, regional, differences, in, topography, hydrology, vegetation, and, other, factors, including, human, involvement, other, important, factors, include, fertility, natural, disturbance, competition, herbivory, burial, and, salinity, when, peat, accumulates, bogs, and, fens, arise, the, most, important, factor, producing, wetlands, is, hydrology, or, flooding, the, duration, of, flooding, or, prolonged, soil, saturation, by, groundwater, determines, whether, the, resulting, wetland, has, aquatic, marsh, or, swamp, vegetation, other, important, factors, include, soil, fertility, natural, disturbance, competition, herbivory, burial, and, salinity, when, peat, from, dead, plants, accumulates, bogs, and, fens, develop, wetland, hydrology, is, associated, with, the, spatial, and, temporal, dispersion, flow, and, physio, chemical, attributes, of, surface, and, ground, waters, sources, of, hydrological, flows, into, wetlands, are, predominantly, precipitation, surface, water, saltwater, or, freshwater, and, groundwater, water, flows, out, of, wetlands, by, evapotranspiration, surface, flows, and, tides, and, subsurface, water, outflow, hydrodynamics, the, movement, of, water, through, and, from, a, wetland, affects, hydro, periods, temporal, fluctuations, in, water, levels, by, controlling, the, water, balance, and, water, storage, within, a, wetland, landscape, characteristics, control, wetland, hydrology, and, water, chemistry, the, o, 2, and, co, 2, concentrations, of, water, depend, upon, temperature, atmospheric, pressure, and, mixing, with, the, air, from, winds, or, water, flows, water, chemistry, within, wetlands, is, determined, by, the, ph, salinity, nutrients, conductivity, soil, composition, hardness, and, the, sources, of, water, water, chemistry, varies, across, landscapes, and, climatic, regions, wetlands, are, generally, minerotrophic, waters, contain, dissolved, materials, from, soils, with, the, exception, of, ombrotrophic, bogs, that, are, fed, only, by, water, from, precipitation, because, bogs, receive, most, of, their, water, from, precipitation, and, humidity, from, the, atmosphere, their, water, usually, has, low, mineral, ionic, composition, in, contrast, wetlands, fed, by, groundwater, or, tides, have, a, higher, concentration, of, dissolved, nutrients, and, minerals, fen, peatlands, receive, water, both, from, precipitation, and, ground, water, in, varying, amounts, so, their, water, chemistry, ranges, from, acidic, with, low, levels, of, dissolved, minerals, to, alkaline, with, high, accumulation, of, calcium, and, magnesium, salinity, has, a, strong, influence, on, wetland, water, chemistry, particularly, in, coastal, wetlands, and, in, arid, and, semiarid, regions, with, large, precipitation, deficits, natural, salinity, is, regulated, by, interactions, between, ground, and, surface, water, which, may, be, influenced, by, human, activity, carbon, is, the, major, nutrient, cycled, within, wetlands, most, nutrients, such, as, sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, and, nitrogen, are, found, within, the, soil, of, wetlands, anaerobic, and, aerobic, respiration, in, the, soil, influences, the, nutrient, cycling, of, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and, nitrogen, and, the, solubility, of, phosphorus, thus, contributing, to, the, chemical, variations, in, its, water, wetlands, with, low, ph, and, saline, conductivity, may, reflect, the, presence, of, acid, sulfates, and, wetlands, with, average, salinity, levels, can, be, heavily, influenced, by, calcium, or, magnesium, biogeochemical, processes, in, wetlands, are, determined, by, soils, with, low, redox, potential, the, life, forms, of, a, wetland, system, includes, its, plants, flora, and, animals, fauna, and, microbes, bacteria, fungi, the, most, important, factor, is, the, wetland, s, duration, of, flooding, other, important, factors, include, fertility, and, salinity, of, the, water, or, soils, the, chemistry, of, water, flowing, into, wetlands, depends, on, the, source, of, water, the, geological, material, that, it, flows, through, and, the, nutrients, discharged, from, organic, matter, in, the, soils, and, plants, at, higher, elevations, plants, and, animals, may, vary, within, a, wetland, seasonally, or, in, response, to, flood, regimes, there, are, four, main, groups, of, hydrophytes, that, are, found, in, wetland, systems, throughout, the, world, submerged, wetland, vegetation, can, grow, in, saline, and, fresh, water, conditions, some, species, have, underwater, flowers, while, others, have, long, stems, to, allow, the, flowers, to, reach, the, surface, submerged, species, provide, a, food, source, for, native, fauna, habitat, for, invertebrates, and, also, possess, filtration, capabilities, examples, include, seagrasses, and, eelgrass, floating, water, plants, or, floating, vegetation, are, usually, small, like, those, in, the, lemnoideae, subfamily, duckweeds, emergent, vegetation, like, the, cattails, typha, spp, sedges, carex, spp, and, arrow, arum, peltandra, virginica, rise, above, the, surface, of, the, water, when, trees, and, shrubs, comprise, much, of, the, plant, cover, in, saturated, soils, those, areas, in, most, cases, are, called, swamps, the, upland, boundary, of, swamps, is, determined, partly, by, water, levels, this, can, be, affected, by, dams, some, swamps, can, be, dominated, by, a, single, species, such, as, silver, maple, swamps, around, the, great, lakes, others, like, those, of, the, amazon, basin, have, large, numbers, of, different, tree, species, other, examples, include, cypress, taxodium, and, mangrove, swamps, many, species, of, fish, are, highly, dependent, on, wetland, ecosystems, seventy, five, percent, of, the, united, states, commercial, fish, and, shellfish, stocks, depend, solely, on, estuaries, to, survive, tropical, fish, species, need, mangroves, for, critical, hatchery, and, nursery, grounds, and, the, coral, reef, system, for, food, amphibians, such, as, frogs, and, salamanders, need, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, habitats, in, which, to, reproduce, and, feed, because, amphibians, often, inhabit, depressional, wetlands, like, prairie, potholes, and, carolina, bays, the, connectivity, among, these, isolated, wetlands, is, an, important, control, of, regional, populations, while, tadpoles, feed, on, algae, adult, frogs, forage, on, insects, frogs, are, sometimes, used, as, an, indicator, of, ecosystem, health, because, their, thin, skin, permits, absorption, of, nutrients, and, toxins, from, the, surrounding, environment, resulting, in, increased, extinction, rates, in, unfavorable, and, polluted, environmental, conditions, reptiles, such, as, snakes, lizards, turtles, alligators, and, crocodiles, are, common, in, wetlands, of, some, regions, in, freshwater, wetlands, of, the, southeastern, us, alligators, are, common, and, a, freshwater, species, of, crocodile, occurs, in, south, florida, the, florida, everglades, is, the, only, place, in, the, world, where, both, crocodiles, and, alligators, coexist, the, saltwater, crocodile, inhabits, estuaries, and, mangroves, and, can, be, seen, along, the, eastern, coastline, of, australia, snapping, turtles, are, one, of, the, many, kinds, of, turtles, found, in, wetlands, birds, particularly, waterfowl, and, wading, birds, use, wetlands, extensively, mammals, of, wetlands, include, numerous, small, and, medium, sized, species, such, as, voles, bats, muskrats, and, platypus, in, addition, to, large, herbivorous, and, apex, predator, species, such, as, the, beaver, coypu, swamp, rabbit, florida, panther, and, moose, wetlands, attract, many, mammals, due, to, abundant, seeds, berries, and, other, vegetation, as, food, for, herbivores, as, well, as, abundant, populations, of, invertebrates, small, reptiles, and, amphibians, as, prey, for, predators, invertebrates, of, wetlands, include, aquatic, insects, such, as, dragonflies, aquatic, bugs, and, beetles, midges, mosquitoes, crustaceans, such, as, crabs, crayfish, shrimps, microcrustaceans, mollusks, such, as, clams, mussels, snails, and, worms, such, as, polychaetes, oligochaetes, leeches, among, others, invertebrates, comprise, more, than, half, of, the, known, animal, species, in, wetlands, and, are, considered, the, primary, food, web, link, between, plants, and, higher, animals, such, as, fish, and, birds, the, low, oxygen, conditions, in, wetland, water, and, their, frequent, flooding, and, drying, daily, in, tidal, wetlands, seasonally, in, temporary, ponds, and, floodplains, prevent, many, invertebrates, from, inhabiting, wetlands, and, thus, the, invertebrate, fauna, of, wetlands, is, often, less, diverse, than, some, other, kinds, of, habitat, such, as, streams, coral, reefs, and, forests, some, wetland, invertebrates, thrive, in, habitats, that, lack, predatory, fish, many, insects, only, inhabit, wetlands, as, aquatic, immatures, nymphs, larvae, and, the, flying, adults, inhabit, upland, habitats, returning, to, the, wetlands, to, lay, eggs, depending, on, a, wetland, s, geographic, and, topographic, location, the, functions, it, performs, can, support, multiple, ecosystem, services, values, or, benefits, united, nations, millennium, ecosystem, assessment, and, ramsar, convention, described, wetlands, as, a, whole, to, be, of, biosphere, significance, and, societal, importance, in, the, following, areas, according, to, the, ramsar, convention, the, economic, worth, of, the, ecosystem, services, provided, to, society, by, intact, naturally, functioning, wetlands, is, frequently, much, greater, than, the, perceived, benefits, of, converting, them, to, more, valuable, intensive, land, use, particularly, as, the, profits, from, unsustainable, use, often, go, to, relatively, few, individuals, or, corporations, rather, than, being, shared, by, society, as, a, whole, to, replace, these, wetland, ecosystem, services, enormous, amounts, of, money, would, need, to, be, spent, on, water, purification, plants, dams, levees, and, other, hard, infrastructure, and, many, of, the, services, are, impossible, to, replace, floodplains, and, closed, depression, wetlands, can, provide, the, functions, of, storage, reservoirs, and, flood, protection, the, wetland, system, of, floodplains, is, formed, from, major, rivers, downstream, from, their, headwaters, the, floodplains, of, major, rivers, act, as, natural, storage, reservoirs, enabling, excess, water, to, spread, out, over, a, wide, area, which, reduces, its, depth, and, speed, wetlands, close, to, the, headwaters, of, streams, and, rivers, can, slow, down, rainwater, runoff, and, spring, snowmelt, so, that, it, does, not, run, straight, off, the, land, into, water, courses, this, can, help, prevent, sudden, damaging, floods, downstream, notable, river, systems, that, produce, wide, floodplains, include, the, nile, river, the, niger, river, inland, delta, the, zambezi, river, flood, plain, the, okavango, river, inland, delta, the, kafue, river, flood, plain, the, lake, bangweulu, flood, plain, africa, mississippi, river, us, amazon, river, south, america, yangtze, river, china, danube, river, central, europe, and, murray, darling, river, australia, groundwater, replenishment, can, be, achieved, for, example, by, marsh, swamp, and, subterranean, karst, and, cave, hydrological, systems, the, surface, water, visibly, seen, in, wetlands, only, represents, a, portion, of, the, overall, water, cycle, which, also, includes, atmospheric, water, precipitation, and, groundwater, many, wetlands, are, directly, linked, to, groundwater, and, they, can, be, a, crucial, regulator, of, both, the, quantity, and, quality, of, water, found, below, the, ground, wetlands, that, have, permeable, substrates, like, limestone, or, occur, in, areas, with, highly, variable, and, fluctuating, water, tables, have, especially, important, roles, in, groundwater, replenishment, or, water, recharge, substrates, that, are, porous, allow, water, to, filter, down, through, the, soil, and, underlying, rock, into, aquifers, which, are, the, source, of, much, of, the, world, s, drinking, water, wetlands, can, also, act, as, recharge, areas, when, the, surrounding, water, table, is, low, and, as, a, discharge, zone, when, it, is, high, mangroves, coral, reefs, salt, marsh, can, help, with, shoreline, stabilization, and, storm, protection, tidal, and, inter, tidal, wetland, systems, protect, and, stabilize, coastal, zones, coral, reefs, provide, a, protective, barrier, to, coastal, shoreline, mangroves, stabilize, the, coastal, zone, from, the, interior, and, will, migrate, with, the, shoreline, to, remain, adjacent, to, the, boundary, of, the, water, the, main, conservation, benefit, these, systems, have, against, storms, and, storm, surges, is, the, ability, to, reduce, the, speed, and, height, of, waves, and, floodwaters, the, united, kingdom, has, begun, the, concept, of, managed, coastal, realignment, this, management, technique, provides, shoreline, protection, through, restoration, of, natural, wetlands, rather, than, through, applied, engineering, in, east, asia, reclamation, of, coastal, wetlands, has, resulted, in, widespread, transformation, of, the, coastal, zone, and, up, to, 65, of, coastal, wetlands, have, been, destroyed, by, coastal, development, one, analysis, using, the, impact, of, hurricanes, versus, storm, protection, provided, naturally, by, wetlands, projected, the, value, of, this, service, at, us, 33, 000, hectare, year, water, purification, can, be, provided, by, floodplains, closed, depression, wetlands, mudflat, freshwater, marsh, salt, marsh, mangroves, wetlands, cycle, both, sediments, and, nutrients, sometimes, serving, as, buffers, between, terrestrial, and, aquatic, ecosystems, a, natural, function, of, wetland, vegetation, is, the, up, take, storage, and, for, nitrate, the, removal, of, nutrients, found, in, runoff, water, from, the, surrounding, landscapes, precipitation, and, surface, runoff, induces, soil, erosion, transporting, sediment, in, suspension, into, and, through, waterways, all, types, of, sediments, whether, composed, of, clay, silt, sand, or, gravel, and, rock, can, be, carried, into, wetland, systems, through, erosion, wetland, vegetation, acts, as, a, physical, barrier, to, slow, water, flow, and, then, trap, sediment, for, both, short, or, long, periods, of, time, suspended, sediment, can, contain, heavy, metals, that, are, also, retained, when, wetlands, trap, the, sediment, the, ability, of, wetland, systems, to, store, or, remove, nutrients, and, trap, sediment, is, highly, efficient, and, effective, but, each, system, has, a, threshold, an, overabundance, of, nutrient, input, from, fertilizer, run, off, sewage, effluent, or, non, point, pollution, will, cause, eutrophication, upstream, erosion, from, deforestation, can, overwhelm, wetlands, making, them, shrink, in, size, and, cause, dramatic, biodiversity, loss, through, excessive, sedimentation, load, constructed, wetlands, are, built, for, wastewater, treatment, an, example, of, how, a, natural, wetland, is, used, to, provide, some, degree, of, sewage, treatment, is, the, east, kolkata, wetlands, in, kolkata, india, the, wetlands, cover, 125, square, kilometres, 48, sq, mi, and, are, used, to, treat, kolkata, s, sewage, the, nutrients, contained, in, the, wastewater, sustain, fish, farms, and, agriculture, a, constructed, wetland, is, an, artificial, wetland, to, treat, sewage, greywater, stormwater, runoff, or, industrial, wastewater, it, may, also, be, designed, for, land, reclamation, after, mining, or, as, a, mitigation, step, for, natural, areas, lost, to, land, development, constructed, wetlands, are, engineered, systems, that, use, the, natural, functions, of, vegetation, soil, and, organisms, to, provide, secondary, treatment, to, wastewater, the, design, of, the, constructed, wetland, has, to, be, adjusted, according, to, the, type, of, wastewater, to, be, treated, constructed, wetlands, have, been, used, in, both, centralized, and, decentralized, wastewater, systems, primary, treatment, is, recommended, when, there, is, a, large, amount, of, suspended, solids, or, soluble, organic, matter, measured, as, biochemical, oxygen, demand, and, chemical, oxygen, demand, wetland, systems, rich, biodiversity, has, become, a, focal, point, catalysed, by, the, ramsar, convention, and, world, wildlife, fund, the, impact, of, maintaining, biodiversity, is, seen, at, the, local, level, through, job, creation, sustainability, and, community, productivity, a, good, example, is, the, lower, mekong, basin, which, runs, through, cambodia, laos, and, vietnam, supporting, over, 55, million, people, a, key, fish, species, which, is, overfished, the, piramutaba, catfish, brachyplatystoma, vaillantii, migrates, more, than, 3, 300, km, 2, 100, mi, from, its, nursery, grounds, near, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, to, its, spawning, grounds, in, andean, tributaries, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, above, sea, level, distributing, plant, seeds, along, the, route, intertidal, mudflats, have, a, level, of, productivity, similar, to, that, of, some, wetlands, even, while, possessing, a, low, number, of, species, the, abundant, invertebrates, found, within, the, mud, are, a, food, source, for, migratory, waterfowl, mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and, seagrass, beds, have, high, levels, of, both, species, richness, and, productivity, and, are, home, to, important, nursery, areas, for, many, commercial, fish, stocks, populations, of, many, species, are, confined, geographically, to, only, one, or, a, few, wetland, systems, often, due, to, the, long, period, of, time, that, the, wetlands, have, been, physically, isolated, from, other, aquatic, sources, for, example, the, number, of, endemic, species, in, the, selenga, river, delta, of, lake, baikal, in, russia, classifies, it, as, a, hotspot, for, biodiversity, and, one, of, the, most, biodiverse, wetlands, in, the, entire, world, wetlands, naturally, produce, an, array, of, vegetation, and, other, ecological, products, that, can, be,

of, protein, for, about, one, billion, people, and, comprise, 15, of, an, additional, 3, 5, billion, people, s, protein, intake, another, food, staple, found, in, wetland, systems, is, rice, a, popular, grain, that, is, consumed, at, the, rate, of, one, fifth, of, the, total, global, calorie, count, in, bangladesh, cambodia, and, vietnam, where, rice, paddies, are, predominant, on, the, landscape, rice, consumption, reach, 70, some, native, wetland, plants, in, the, caribbean, and, australia, are, harvested, sustainably, for, medicinal, compounds, these, include, the, red, mangrove, rhizophora, mangle, which, possesses, antibacterial, wound, healing, anti, ulcer, effects, and, antioxidant, properties, other, mangrove, derived, products, include, fuelwood, salt, produced, by, evaporating, seawater, animal, fodder, traditional, medicines, e, g, from, mangrove, bark, fibers, for, textiles, and, dyes, and, tannins, some, types, of, wetlands, can, serve, as, fire, breaks, that, help, slow, the, spread, of, minor, wildfires, larger, wetland, systems, can, influence, local, precipitation, patterns, some, boreal, wetland, systems, in, catchment, headwaters, may, help, extend, the, period, of, flow, and, maintain, water, temperature, in, connected, downstream, waters, pollination, services, are, supported, by, many, wetlands, which, may, provide, the, only, suitable, habitat, for, pollinating, insects, birds, and, mammals, in, highly, developed, areas, wetlands, the, functions, and, services, they, provide, as, well, as, their, flora, and, fauna, can, be, affected, by, several, types, of, disturbances, the, disturbances, sometimes, termed, stressors, or, alterations, can, be, human, associated, or, natural, direct, or, indirect, reversible, or, not, and, isolated, or, cumulative, disturbances, include, exogenous, factors, such, as, flooding, or, drought, humans, are, disturbing, and, damaging, wetlands, for, example, by, oil, and, gas, extraction, building, infrastructure, overgrazing, of, livestock, overfishing, alteration, of, wetlands, including, dredging, and, draining, nutrient, pollution, and, water, pollution, disturbance, puts, different, levels, of, stress, on, an, environment, depending, on, the, type, and, duration, of, disturbance, predominant, disturbances, of, wetlands, include, disturbances, can, be, further, categorized, as, follows, nutrient, pollution, comes, from, nitrogen, inputs, to, aquatic, systems, and, have, drastically, effected, the, dissolved, nitrogen, content, of, wetlands, introducing, higher, nutrient, availability, which, leads, to, eutrophication, biodiversity, loss, occurs, in, wetland, systems, through, land, use, changes, habitat, destruction, pollution, exploitation, of, resources, and, invasive, species, for, example, the, introduction, of, water, hyacinth, a, native, plant, of, south, america, into, lake, victoria, in, east, africa, as, well, as, duckweed, into, non, native, areas, of, queensland, australia, have, overtaken, entire, wetland, systems, overwhelming, the, habitats, and, reducing, the, diversity, of, native, plants, and, animals, to, increase, economic, productivity, wetlands, are, often, converted, into, dry, land, with, dykes, and, drains, and, used, for, agricultural, purposes, the, construction, of, dykes, and, dams, has, negative, consequences, for, individual, wetlands, and, entire, watersheds, 497, their, proximity, to, lakes, and, rivers, means, that, they, are, often, developed, for, human, settlement, once, settlements, are, constructed, and, protected, by, dykes, the, settlements, then, become, vulnerable, to, land, subsidence, and, ever, increasing, risk, of, flooding, 497, the, mississippi, river, delta, around, new, orleans, louisiana, is, a, well, known, example, the, danube, delta, in, europe, is, another, drainage, of, floodplains, or, development, activities, that, narrow, floodplain, corridors, such, as, the, construction, of, levees, reduces, the, ability, of, coupled, river, floodplain, systems, to, control, flood, damage, that, is, because, modified, and, less, expansive, systems, must, still, manage, the, same, amount, of, precipitation, causing, flood, peaks, to, be, higher, or, deeper, and, floodwaters, to, travel, faster, water, management, engineering, developments, in, the, past, century, have, degraded, floodplain, wetlands, through, the, construction, of, artificial, embankments, such, as, dykes, bunds, levees, weirs, barrages, and, dams, all, concentrate, water, into, a, main, channel, and, waters, that, historically, spread, slowly, over, a, large, shallow, area, are, concentrated, loss, of, wetland, floodplains, results, in, more, severe, and, damaging, flooding, catastrophic, human, impact, in, the, mississippi, river, floodplains, was, seen, in, death, of, several, hundred, individuals, during, a, levee, breach, in, new, orleans, caused, by, hurricane, katrina, human, made, embankments, along, the, yangtze, river, floodplains, have, caused, the, main, channel, of, the, river, to, become, prone, to, more, frequent, and, damaging, flooding, some, of, these, events, include, the, loss, of, riparian, vegetation, a, 30, loss, of, the, vegetation, cover, throughout, the, river, s, basin, a, doubling, of, the, percentage, of, the, land, affected, by, soil, erosion, and, a, reduction, in, reservoir, capacity, through, siltation, build, up, in, floodplain, lakes, overfishing, is, a, major, problem, for, sustainable, use, of, wetlands, concerns, are, developing, over, certain, aspects, of, farm, fishing, which, uses, natural, wetlands, and, waterways, to, harvest, fish, for, human, consumption, aquaculture, is, continuing, to, develop, rapidly, throughout, the, asia, pacific, region, especially, in, china, where, 90, of, the, total, number, of, aquaculture, farms, occur, contributing, 80, of, global, value, some, aquaculture, has, eliminated, massive, areas, of, wetland, through, practices, such, as, the, shrimp, farming, industry, s, destruction, of, mangroves, even, though, the, damaging, impact, of, large, scale, shrimp, farming, on, the, coastal, ecosystem, in, many, asian, countries, has, been, widely, recognized, for, quite, some, time, now, it, has, proved, difficult, to, mitigate, since, other, employment, avenues, for, people, are, lacking, also, burgeoning, demand, for, shrimp, globally, has, provided, a, large, and, ready, market, wetlands, have, historically, subjected, to, large, draining, efforts, for, development, real, estate, or, agriculture, and, flooding, to, create, recreational, lakes, or, generate, hydropower, some, of, the, world, s, most, important, agricultural, areas, were, wetlands, that, have, been, converted, to, farmland, since, the, 1970s, more, focus, has, been, put, on, preserving, wetlands, for, their, natural, functions, since, 1900, 65, 70, of, the, world, s, wetlands, have, been, lost, in, order, to, maintain, wetlands, and, sustain, their, functions, alterations, and, disturbances, that, are, outside, the, normal, range, of, variation, should, be, minimized, wetlands, are, vital, ecosystems, that, enhance, the, livelihoods, for, the, millions, of, people, who, live, in, and, around, them, studies, have, shown, that, it, is, possible, to, conserve, wetlands, while, improving, the, livelihoods, of, people, living, among, them, case, studies, conducted, in, malawi, and, zambia, looked, at, how, dambos, wet, grassy, valleys, or, depressions, where, water, seeps, to, the, surface, can, be, farmed, sustainably, project, outcomes, included, a, high, yield, of, crops, development, of, sustainable, farming, techniques, and, water, management, strategies, that, generate, enough, water, for, irrigation, the, ramsar, convention, full, title, convention, on, wetlands, of, international, importance, especially, as, waterfowl, habitat, is, an, international, treaty, designed, to, address, global, concerns, regarding, wetland, loss, and, degradation, the, primary, purposes, of, the, treaty, are, to, list, wetlands, of, international, importance, and, to, promote, their, wise, use, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, preserving, the, world, s, wetlands, methods, include, restricting, access, to, some, wetland, areas, as, well, as, educating, the, public, to, combat, the, misconception, that, wetlands, are, wastelands, the, convention, works, closely, with, five, international, organisation, partners, iops, these, are, birdlife, international, the, iucn, the, international, water, management, institute, wetlands, international, and, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, the, partners, provide, technical, expertise, help, conduct, or, facilitate, field, studies, and, provide, financial, support, restoration, and, restoration, ecologists, intend, to, return, wetlands, to, their, natural, trajectory, by, aiding, directly, with, the, natural, processes, of, the, ecosystem, these, direct, methods, vary, with, respect, to, the, degree, of, physical, manipulation, of, the, natural, environment, and, each, are, associated, with, different, levels, of, restoration, restoration, is, needed, after, disturbance, or, perturbation, of, a, wetland, there, is, no, one, way, to, restore, a, wetland, and, the, level, of, restoration, required, will, be, based, on, the, level, of, disturbance, although, each, method, of, restoration, does, require, preparation, and, administration, factors, influencing, selected, approach, may, include, budget, time, scale, limitations, project, goals, level, of, disturbance, landscape, and, ecological, constraints, political, and, administrative, agendas, and, socioeconomic, priorities, for, this, strategy, there, is, no, biophysical, manipulation, and, the, ecosystem, is, left, to, recover, based, on, the, process, of, succession, alone, the, focus, is, to, eliminate, and, prevent, further, disturbance, from, occurring, and, for, this, type, of, restoration, requires, prior, research, to, understand, the, probability, that, the, wetland, will, recover, naturally, this, is, likely, to, be, the, first, method, of, approach, since, it, is, the, least, intrusive, and, least, expensive, although, some, biophysical, non, intrusive, manipulation, may, be, required, to, enhance, the, rate, of, succession, to, an, acceptable, level, example, methods, include, prescribed, burns, to, small, areas, promotion, of, site, specific, soil, microbiota, and, plant, growth, using, nucleation, planting, whereby, plants, radiate, from, an, initial, planting, site, and, promotion, of, niche, diversity, or, increasing, the, range, of, niches, to, promote, use, by, a, variety, of, different, species, these, methods, can, make, it, easier, for, the, natural, species, to, flourish, by, removing, environmental, impediments, and, can, speed, up, the, process, of, succession, for, this, strategy, a, mixture, of, natural, regeneration, and, manipulated, environmental, control, is, used, this, may, require, some, engineering, and, more, intensive, biophysical, manipulations, including, ripping, of, subsoil, agrichemical, applications, of, herbicides, or, insecticides, laying, of, mulch, mechanical, seed, dispersal, and, tree, planting, on, a, large, scale, in, these, circumstances, the, wetland, is, impaired, and, without, human, assistance, it, would, not, recover, within, an, acceptable, period, of, time, as, determined, by, ecologists, methods, of, restoration, used, will, have, to, be, determined, on, a, site, by, site, basis, as, each, location, will, require, a, different, approach, based, on, levels, of, disturbance, and, the, local, ecosystem, dynamics, this, most, expensive, and, intrusive, method, of, reconstruction, requires, engineering, and, ground, up, reconstruction, because, there, is, a, redesign, of, the, entire, ecosystem, it, is, important, that, the, natural, trajectory, of, the, ecosystem, be, considered, and, that, the, plant, species, promoted, will, eventually, return, the, ecosystem, towards, its, natural, trajectory, in, many, cases, constructed, wetlands, are, often, designed, to, treat, stormwater, wastewater, runoff, they, can, be, used, in, developments, as, part, of, water, sensitive, urban, design, systems, and, have, benefits, such, as, flood, mitigation, removing, pollutants, carbon, sequestration, providing, habitat, for, wildlife, and, biodiversity, in, often, highly, urbanised, and, fragmented, landscapes, the, ideas, from, traditional, ecological, knowledge, can, be, applied, as, a, holistic, approach, to, the, restoration, of, wetlands, these, ideas, focus, more, on, responding, to, the, observations, detected, from, the, environment, considering, that, each, part, of, a, wetland, ecosystem, is, interconnected, applying, these, practices, on, specific, locations, of, wetlands, increase, productivity, biodiversity, and, improve, its, resilience, these, practices, include, monitoring, wetland, resources, planting, propagules, and, addition, of, key, species, in, order, to, create, a, self, sustaining, wetland, ecosystem, in, southeast, asia, peat, swamp, forests, and, soils, are, being, drained, burnt, mined, and, overgrazed, contributing, to, climate, change, as, a, result, of, peat, drainage, the, organic, carbon, that, had, built, up, over, thousands, of, years, and, is, normally, under, water, is, suddenly, exposed, to, the, air, the, peat, decomposes, and, is, converted, into, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, which, is, then, released, into, the, atmosphere, peat, fires, cause, the, same, process, to, occur, rapidly, and, in, addition, create, enormous, clouds, of, smoke, that, cross, international, borders, which, now, happens, almost, yearly, in, southeast, asia, while, peatlands, constitute, only, 3, of, the, world, s, land, area, their, degradation, produces, 7, of, all, co, 2, emissions, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, wetlands, of, concern, consist, primarily, of, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, emissions, wetlands, are, the, largest, natural, source, of, atmospheric, methane, in, the, world, and, are, therefore, a, major, area, of, concern, with, respect, to, climate, change, wetlands, account, for, approximately, 20, 30, of, atmospheric, methane, through, emissions, from, soils, and, plants, and, contribute, an, approximate, average, of, 161, tg, of, methane, to, the, atmosphere, per, year, wetlands, are, characterized, by, water, logged, soils, and, distinctive, communities, of, plant, and, animal, species, that, have, adapted, to, the, constant, presence, of, water, this, high, level, of, water, saturation, creates, conditions, conducive, to, methane, production, most, methanogenesis, or, methane, production, occurs, in, oxygen, poor, environments, because, the, microbes, that, live, in, warm, moist, environments, consume, oxygen, more, rapidly, than, it, can, diffuse, in, from, the, atmosphere, wetlands, are, the, ideal, anaerobic, environments, for, fermentation, as, well, as, methanogen, activity, however, levels, of, methanogenesis, fluctuates, due, to, the, availability, of, oxygen, soil, temperature, and, the, composition, of, the, soil, a, warmer, more, anaerobic, environment, with, soil, rich, in, organic, matter, would, allow, for, more, efficient, methanogenesis, studies, have, favorably, identified, the, potential, for, coastal, wetlands, also, called, blue, carbon, ecosystems, to, provide, some, degree, of, climate, change, mitigation, in, two, ways, by, conservation, reducing, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, arising, from, the, loss, and, degradation, of, such, habitats, and, by, restoration, to, increase, carbon, dioxide, drawdown, and, its, long, term, storage, however, co, 2, removal, using, coastal, blue, carbon, restoration, has, questionable, cost, effectiveness, when, considered, only, as, a, climate, mitigation, action, either, for, carbon, offsetting, or, for, inclusion, in, nationally, determined, contributions, when, wetlands, are, restored, they, have, mitigation, effects, through, their, ability, to, sink, carbon, converting, a, greenhouse, gas, carbon, dioxide, to, solid, plant, material, through, the, process, of, photosynthesis, and, also, through, their, ability, to, store, and, regulate, water, wetlands, store, approximately, 44, 6, million, tonnes, of, carbon, per, year, globally, estimate, from, 2003, in, salt, marshes, and, mangrove, swamps, in, particular, the, average, carbon, sequestration, rate, is, 210, g, co, 2, m, 2, y, 1, while, peatlands, sequester, approximately, 20, 30, g, co, 2, m, 2, y, 1, coastal, wetlands, such, as, tropical, mangroves, and, some, temperate, salt, marshes, are, known, to, be, sinks, for, carbon, that, otherwise, contribute, to, climate, change, in, its, gaseous, forms, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, the, ability, of, many, tidal, wetlands, to, store, carbon, and, minimize, methane, flux, from, tidal, sediments, has, led, to, sponsorship, of, blue, carbon, initiatives, that, are, intended, to, enhance, those, processes, the, restoration, of, coastal, blue, carbon, ecosystems, is, highly, advantageous, for, climate, change, adaptation, coastal, protection, food, provision, and, biodiversity, conservation, since, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, human, caused, climate, change, has, resulted, in, observable, changes, in, the, global, water, cycle, 85, a, warming, climate, makes, extremely, wet, and, very, dry, occurrences, more, severe, causing, more, severe, floods, and, droughts, for, this, reason, some, of, the, ecosystem, services, that, wetlands, provide, e, g, water, storage, and, flood, control, groundwater, replenishment, shoreline, stabilization, and, storm, protection, are, important, for, climate, change, adaptation, measures, in, most, parts, of, the, world, and, under, all, emission, scenarios, water, cycle, variability, and, accompanying, extremes, are, anticipated, to, rise, more, quickly, than, the, changes, of, average, values, 85, the, value, of, a, wetland, to, local, communities, typically, involves, first, mapping, a, region, s, wetlands, then, assessing, the, functions, and, ecosystem, services, the, wetlands, provide, individually, and, cumulatively, and, finally, evaluating, that, information, to, prioritize, or, rank, individual, wetlands, or, wetland, types, for, conservation, management, restoration, or, development, over, the, longer, term, it, requires, keeping, inventories, of, known, wetlands, and, monitoring, a, representative, sample, of, the, wetlands, to, determine, changes, due, to, both, natural, and, human, factors, rapid, assessment, methods, are, used, to, score, rank, rate, or, categorize, various, functions, ecosystem, services, species, communities, levels, of, disturbance, and, or, ecological, health, of, a, wetland, or, group, of, wetlands, this, is, often, done, to, prioritize, particular, wetlands, for, conservation, avoidance, or, to, determine, the, degree, to, which, loss, or, alteration, of, wetland, functions, should, be, compensated, such, as, by, restoring, degraded, wetlands, elsewhere, or, providing, additional, protections, to, existing, wetlands, rapid, assessment, methods, are, also, applied, before, and, after, a, wetland, has, been, restored, or, altered, to, help, monitor, or, predict, the, effects, of, those, actions, on, various, wetland, functions, and, the, services, they, provide, assessments, are, typically, considered, to, be, rapid, when, they, require, only, a, single, visit, to, the, wetland, lasting, less, than, one, day, which, in, some, cases, may, include, interpretation, of, aerial, imagery, and, geographic, information, system, gis, analyses, of, existing, spatial, data, but, not, detailed, post, visit, laboratory, analyses, of, water, or, biological, samples, to, achieve, consistency, among, persons, doing, the, assessment, rapid, methods, present, indicator, variables, as, questions, or, checklists, on, standardized, data, forms, and, most, methods, standardize, the, scoring, or, rating, procedure, that, is, used, to, combine, question, responses, into, estimates, of, the, levels, of, specified, functions, relative, to, the, levels, estimated, in, other, wetlands, calibration, sites, assessed, previously, in, a, region, rapid, assessment, methods, partly, because, they, often, use, dozens, of, indicators, pertaining, to, conditions, surrounding, a, wetland, as, well, as, within, the, wetland, itself, aim, to, provide, estimates, of, wetland, functions, and, services, that, are, more, accurate, and, repeatable, than, simply, describing, a, wetland, s, class, type, a, need, for, wetland, assessments, to, be, rapid, arises, mostly, when, government, agencies, set, deadlines, for, decisions, affecting, a, wetland, or, when, the, number, of, wetlands, needing, information, on, their, functions, or, condition, is, large, although, developing, a, global, inventory, of, wetlands, has, proven, to, be, a, large, and, difficult, undertaking, many, efforts, at, more, local, scales, have, been, successful, current, efforts, are, based, on, available, data, but, both, classification, and, spatial, resolution, have, sometimes, proven, to, be, inadequate, for, regional, or, site, specific, environmental, management, decision, making, it, is, difficult, to, identify, small, long, and, narrow, wetlands, within, the, landscape, many, of, today, s, remote, sensing, satellites, do, not, have, sufficient, spatial, and, spectral, resolution, to, monitor, wetland, conditions, although, multispectral, ikonos, and, quickbird, data, may, offer, improved, spatial, resolutions, once, it, is, 4, m, or, higher, majority, of, the, pixels, are, just, mixtures, of, several, plant, species, or, vegetation, types, and, are, difficult, to, isolate, which, translates, into, an, inability, to, classify, the, vegetation, that, defines, the, wetland, the, growing, availability, of, 3d, vegetation, and, topography, data, from, lidar, has, partially, addressed, the, limitation, of, traditional, multispectral, imagery, as, demonstrated, in, some, case, studies, across, the, world, a, wetland, needs, to, be, monitored, over, time, to, assess, whether, it, is, functioning, at, an, ecologically, sustainable, level, or, whether, it, is, becoming, degraded, degraded, wetlands, will, suffer, a, loss, in, water, quality, loss, of, sensitive, species, and, aberrant, functioning, of, soil, geochemical, processes, practically, many, natural, wetlands, are, difficult, to, monitor, from, the, ground, as, they, quite, often, are, difficult, to, access, and, may, require, exposure, to, dangerous, plants, and, animals, as, well, as, diseases, borne, by, insects, or, other, invertebrates, remote, sensing, such, as, aerial, imagery, and, satellite, imaging, provides, effective, tools, to, map, and, monitor, wetlands, across, large, geographic, regions, and, over, time, many, remote, sensing, methods, can, be, used, to, map, wetlands, the, integration, of, multi, sourced, data, such, as, lidar, and, aerial, photos, proves, more, effective, at, mapping, wetlands, than, the, use, of, aerial, photos, alone, especially, with, the, aid, of, modern, machine, learning, methods, e, g, deep, learning, overall, using, digital, data, provides, a, standardized, data, collection, procedure, and, an, opportunity, for, data, integration, within, a, geographic, information, system, the, ramsar, convention, on, wetlands, of, international, importance, especially, as, waterfowl, habitat, is, an, international, treaty, for, the, conservation, and, sustainable, use, of, ramsar, sites, wetlands, it, is, also, known, as, the, convention, on, wetlands, it, is, named, after, the, city, of, ramsar, in, iran, where, the, convention, was, signed, in, 1971, every, three, years, representatives, of, the, contracting, parties, meet, as, the, conference, of, the, contracting, parties, cop, the, policy, making, organ, of, the, convention, which, adopts, decisions, site, designations, resolutions, and, recommendations, to, administer, the, work, of, the, convention, and, improve, the, way, in, which, the, parties, are, able, to, implement, its, objectives, in, 2022, cop14, was, co, held, in, wuhan, china, and, geneva, switzerland, each, country, and, region, tends, to, have, its, own, definition, of, wetlands, for, legal, purposes, in, the, united, states, wetlands, are, defined, as, those, areas, that, are, inundated, or, saturated, by, surface, or, groundwater, at, a, frequency, and, duration, sufficient, to, support, and, that, under, normal, circumstances, do, support, a, prevalence, of, vegetation, typically, adapted, for, life, in, saturated, soil, conditions, wetlands, generally, include, swamps, marshes, bogs, and, similar, areas, this, definition, has, been, used, in, the, enforcement, of, the, clean, water, act, some, us, states, such, as, massachusetts, and, new, york, have, separate, definitions, that, may, differ, from, the, federal, government, s, in, the, united, states, code, the, term, wetland, is, defined, as, land, that, a, has, a, predominance, of, hydric, soils, b, is, inundated, or, saturated, by, surface, or, groundwater, at, a, frequency, and, duration, sufficient, to, support, a, prevalence, of, hydrophytic, vegetation, typically, adapted, for, life, in, saturated, soil, conditions, and, c, under, normal, circumstances, supports, a, prevalence, of, such, vegetation, related, to, these, legal, definitions, normal, circumstances, are, expected, to, occur, during, the, wet, portion, of, the, growing, season, under, normal, climatic, conditions, not, unusually, dry, or, unusually, wet, and, in, the, absence, of, significant, disturbance, it, is, not, uncommon, for, a, wetland, to, be, dry, for, long, portions, of, the, growing, season, but, under, normal, environmental, conditions, the, soils, will, be, saturated, to, the, surface, or, inundated, creating, anaerobic, conditions, persisting, through, the, wet, portion, of, the, growing, season, the, world, s, largest, wetlands, include, the, swamp, forests, of, the, amazon, river, basin, the, peatlands, of, the, west, siberian, plain, the, pantanal, in, south, america, and, the, sundarbans, in, the, ganges, brahmaputra, delta
