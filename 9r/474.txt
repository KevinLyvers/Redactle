the, term, chloride, refers, to, a, compound, or, molecule, that, contains, either, a, chlorine, ion, cl, which, is, a, negatively, charged, chlorine, atom, or, a, non, charged, chlorine, atom, covalently, bonded, to, the, rest, of, the, molecule, by, a, single, bond, cl, many, inorganic, chlorides, are, salts, many, organic, compounds, are, chlorides, the, pronunciation, of, the, word, chloride, is, k, l, r, a, d, the, chlorine, ion, is, an, anion, negatively, charged, ion, with, the, charge, cl, chloride, salts, such, as, sodium, chloride, are, often, soluble, in, water, it, is, an, essential, electrolyte, located, in, all, body, fluids, responsible, for, maintaining, acid, base, balance, transmitting, nerve, impulses, and, regulating, liquid, flow, in, and, out, of, cells, other, examples, of, ionic, chlorides, are, sodium, chloride, nacl, calcium, chloride, cacl, 2, and, ammonium, chloride, cl, the, chloride, is, also, a, neutral, chlorine, atom, covalently, bonded, by, a, single, bond, to, the, rest, of, the, molecule, for, example, methyl, chloride, ch, 3, cl, is, an, organic, compound, with, a, covalent, c, cl, bond, in, which, the, chlorine, is, not, an, anion, other, examples, of, covalent, chlorides, are, carbon, tetrachloride, ccl, 4, sulfuryl, chloride, so, 2, cl, 2, and, monochloramine, nh, 2, cl, a, chloride, ion, diameter, 167, pm, is, much, larger, than, a, chlorine, atom, diameter, 99, pm, the, chlorine, atom, s, hold, on, the, valence, shell, is, weaker, because, the, chloride, anion, has, one, more, electron, than, it, does, the, ion, is, colorless, and, diamagnetic, in, aqueous, solution, it, is, highly, soluble, in, most, cases, however, for, some, chloride, salts, such, as, silver, chloride, lead, ii, chloride, and, mercury, i, chloride, they, are, only, slightly, soluble, in, water, in, aqueous, solution, chloride, is, bonded, by, the, protic, end, of, the, water, molecules, chloride, can, be, oxidized, but, not, reduced, the, first, oxidation, as, employed, in, the, chlor, alkali, process, is, conversion, to, chlorine, gas, chlorine, can, be, further, oxidized, to, other, oxides, and, oxyanions, including, hypochlorite, clo, the, active, ingredient, in, chlorine, bleach, chlorine, dioxide, clo, 2, chlorate, clo, 3, and, perchlorate, clo, 4, in, terms, of, its, acid, base, properties, chloride, is, a, weak, base, as, indicated, by, the, negative, value, of, the, p, k, a, of, hydrochloric, acid, chloride, can, be, protonated, by, strong, acids, such, as, sulfuric, acid, ionic, chloride, salts, react, with, other, salts, to, exchange, anions, the, presence, of, halide, ions, like, chloride, can, be, detected, using, silver, nitrate, a, solution, containing, chloride, ions, will, produce, a, white, silver, chloride, precipitate, the, concentration, of, chloride, in, an, assay, can, be, determined, using, a, chloridometer, which, detects, silver, ions, once, all, chloride, in, the, assay, has, precipitated, via, this, reaction, chlorided, silver, electrodes, are, commonly, used, in, ex, vivo, electrophysiology, chlorine, can, assume, oxidation, states, of, 1, 1, 3, 5, or, 7, several, neutral, chlorine, oxides, are, also, known, in, nature, chloride, is, found, primarily, in, seawater, which, has, a, chloride, ion, concentration, of, 19400, mg, liter, smaller, quantities, though, at, higher, concentrations, occur, in, certain, inland, seas, and, in, subterranean, brine, wells, such, as, the, great, salt, lake, in, utah, and, the, dead, sea, in, israel, most, chloride, salts, are, soluble, in, water, thus, chloride, containing, minerals, are, usually, only, found, in, abundance, in, dry, climates, or, deep, underground, some, chloride, containing, minerals, include, halite, sodium, chloride, nacl, sylvite, potassium, chloride, kcl, bischofite, mgcl, 2, 6h, 2, o, carnallite, kcl, mgcl, 2, 6h, 2, o, and, kainite, kcl, mgso, 4, 3h, 2, o, it, is, also, found, in, evaporite, minerals, such, as, chlorapatite, and, sodalite, chloride, has, a, major, physiological, significance, which, includes, regulation, of, osmotic, pressure, electrolyte, balance, and, acid, base, homeostasis, chloride, is, present, in, all, body, fluids, and, is, the, most, abundant, extracellular, anion, which, accounts, for, around, one, third, of, extracellular, fluid, s, tonicity, chloride, is, an, essential, electrolyte, playing, a, key, role, in, maintaining, cell, homeostasis, and, transmitting, action, potentials, in, neurons, it, can, flow, through, chloride, channels, including, the, gaba, a, receptor, and, is, transported, by, kcc2, and, nkcc2, transporters, chloride, is, usually, though, not, always, at, a, higher, extracellular, concentration, causing, it, to, have, a, negative, reversal, potential, around, 61, mv, at, 37, c, in, a, mammalian, cell, characteristic, concentrations, of, chloride, in, model, organisms, are, in, both, e, coli, and, budding, yeast, are, 10, 200, mm, dependent, on, medium, in, mammalian, cells, 5, 100, mm, and, in, blood, plasma, 100, mm, the, concentration, of, chloride, in, the, blood, is, called, serum, chloride, and, this, concentration, is, regulated, by, the, kidneys, a, chloride, ion, is, a, structural, component, of, some, proteins, for, example, it, is, present, in, the, amylase, enzyme, for, these, roles, chloride, is, one, of, the, essential, dietary, mineral, listed, by, its, element, name, chlorine, serum, chloride, levels, are, mainly, regulated, by, the, kidneys, through, a, variety, of, transporters, that, are, present, along, the, nephron, most, of, the, chloride, which, is, filtered, by, the, glomerulus, is, reabsorbed, by, both, proximal, and, distal, tubules, majorly, by, proximal, tubule, by, both, active, and, passive, transport, the, presence, of, chlorides, such, as, in, seawater, significantly, worsens, the, conditions, for, pitting, corrosion, of, most, metals, including, stainless, steels, aluminum, and, high, alloyed, materials, chloride, induced, corrosion, of, steel, in, concrete, lead, to, a, local, breakdown, of, the, protective, oxide, form, in, alkaline, concrete, so, that, a, subsequent, localized, corrosion, attack, takes, place, increased, concentrations, of, chloride, can, cause, a, number, of, ecological, effects, in, both, aquatic, and, terrestrial, environments, it, may, contribute, to, the, acidification, of, streams, mobilize, radioactive, soil, metals, by, ion, exchange, affect, the, mortality, and, reproduction, of, aquatic, plants, and, animals, promote, the, invasion, of, saltwater, organisms, into, previously, freshwater, environments, and, interfere, with, the, natural, mixing, of, lakes, sodium, chloride, has, also, been, shown, to, change, the, composition, of, microbial, species, at, relatively, low, concentrations, it, can, also, hinder, the, denitrification, process, a, microbial, process, essential, to, nitrate, removal, and, the, conservation, of, water, quality, and, inhibit, the, nitrification, and, respiration, of, organic, matter, the, chlor, alkali, industry, is, a, major, consumer, of, the, world, s, energy, budget, this, process, converts, concentrated, sodium, chloride, solutions, into, chlorine, and, sodium, hydroxide, which, are, used, to, make, many, other, materials, and, chemicals, the, process, involves, two, parallel, reactions, an, example, is, table, salt, which, is, sodium, chloride, with, the, chemical, formula, nacl, in, water, it, dissociates, into, na, and, cl, ions, salts, such, as, calcium, chloride, magnesium, chloride, potassium, chloride, have, varied, uses, ranging, from, medical, treatments, to, cement, formation, calcium, chloride, cacl, 2, is, a, salt, that, is, marketed, in, pellet, form, for, removing, dampness, from, rooms, calcium, chloride, is, also, used, for, maintaining, unpaved, roads, and, for, fortifying, roadbases, for, new, construction, in, addition, calcium, chloride, is, widely, used, as, a, de, icer, since, it, is, effective, in, lowering, the, melting, point, when, applied, to, ice, examples, of, covalently, bonded, chlorides, are, phosphorus, trichloride, phosphorus, pentachloride, and, thionyl, chloride, all, three, of, which, are, reactive, chlorinating, reagents, that, have, been, used, in, a, laboratory, a, major, application, involving, chloride, is, desalination, which, involves, the, energy, intensive, removal, of, chloride, salts, to, give, potable, water, in, the, petroleum, industry, the, chlorides, are, a, closely, monitored, constituent, of, the, mud, system, an, increase, of, the, chlorides, in, the, mud, system, may, be, an, indication, of, drilling, into, a, high, pressure, saltwater, formation, its, increase, can, also, indicate, the, poor, quality, of, a, target, sand, chloride, is, also, a, useful, and, reliable, chemical, indicator, of, river, and, groundwater, fecal, contamination, as, chloride, is, a, non, reactive, solute, and, ubiquitous, to, sewage, and, potable, water, many, water, regulating, companies, around, the, world, utilize, chloride, to, check, the, contamination, levels, of, the, rivers, and, potable, water, sources, chloride, salts, such, as, sodium, chloride, are, used, to, preserve, food, and, as, nutrients, or,
