organic, chemistry, is, a, subdiscipline, within, chemistry, involving, the, scientific, study, of, the, structure, properties, and, reactions, of, organic, compounds, and, organic, materials, i, e, matter, in, its, various, forms, that, contain, carbon, atoms, study, of, structure, determines, their, structural, formula, study, of, properties, includes, physical, and, chemical, properties, and, evaluation, of, chemical, reactivity, to, understand, their, behavior, the, study, of, organic, reactions, includes, the, chemical, synthesis, of, natural, products, drugs, and, polymers, and, study, of, individual, organic, molecules, in, the, laboratory, and, via, theoretical, in, silico, study, the, range, of, chemicals, studied, in, organic, chemistry, includes, hydrocarbons, compounds, containing, only, carbon, and, hydrogen, as, well, as, compounds, based, on, carbon, but, also, containing, other, elements, especially, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, included, in, many, biochemicals, and, the, halogens, organometallic, chemistry, is, the, study, of, compounds, containing, carbon, metal, bonds, in, addition, contemporary, research, focuses, on, organic, chemistry, involving, other, organometallics, including, the, lanthanides, but, especially, the, transition, metals, zinc, copper, palladium, nickel, cobalt, titanium, and, chromium, organic, compounds, form, the, basis, of, all, earthly, life, and, constitute, the, majority, of, known, chemicals, the, bonding, patterns, of, carbon, with, its, valence, of, four, formal, single, double, and, triple, bonds, plus, structures, with, delocalized, electrons, make, the, array, of, organic, compounds, structurally, diverse, and, their, range, of, applications, enormous, they, form, the, basis, of, or, are, constituents, of, many, commercial, products, including, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and, agrichemicals, and, products, made, from, them, including, lubricants, solvents, plastics, fuels, and, explosives, the, study, of, organic, chemistry, overlaps, organometallic, chemistry, and, biochemistry, but, also, with, medicinal, chemistry, polymer, chemistry, and, materials, science, organic, chemistry, is, typically, taught, at, the, college, or, university, level, it, is, considered, a, very, challenging, course, but, has, also, been, made, accessible, to, students, before, the, 18th, century, chemists, generally, believed, that, compounds, obtained, from, living, organisms, were, endowed, with, a, vital, force, that, distinguished, them, from, inorganic, compounds, according, to, the, concept, of, vitalism, vital, force, theory, organic, matter, was, endowed, with, a, vital, force, during, the, first, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, some, of, the, first, systematic, studies, of, organic, compounds, were, reported, around, 1816, michel, chevreul, started, a, study, of, soaps, made, from, various, fats, and, alkalis, he, separated, the, acids, that, in, combination, with, the, alkali, produced, the, soap, since, these, were, all, individual, compounds, he, demonstrated, that, it, was, possible, to, make, a, chemical, change, in, various, fats, which, traditionally, come, from, organic, sources, producing, new, compounds, without, vital, force, in, 1828, friedrich, w, hler, produced, the, organic, chemical, urea, carbamide, a, constituent, of, urine, from, inorganic, starting, materials, the, salts, potassium, cyanate, and, ammonium, sulfate, in, what, is, now, called, the, w, hler, synthesis, although, w, hler, himself, was, cautious, about, claiming, he, had, disproved, vitalism, this, was, the, first, time, a, substance, thought, to, be, organic, was, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, without, biological, organic, starting, materials, the, event, is, now, generally, accepted, as, indeed, disproving, the, doctrine, of, vitalism, after, w, hler, justus, von, liebig, worked, on, the, organization, of, organic, chemistry, being, considered, one, of, its, principal, founders, in, 1856, william, henry, perkin, while, trying, to, manufacture, quinine, accidentally, produced, the, organic, dye, now, known, as, perkin, s, mauve, his, discovery, made, widely, known, through, its, financial, success, greatly, increased, interest, in, organic, chemistry, a, crucial, breakthrough, for, organic, chemistry, was, the, concept, of, chemical, structure, developed, independently, in, 1858, by, both, friedrich, august, kekul, and, archibald, scott, couper, both, researchers, suggested, that, tetravalent, carbon, atoms, could, link, to, each, other, to, form, a, carbon, lattice, and, that, the, detailed, patterns, of, atomic, bonding, could, be, discerned, by, skillful, interpretations, of, appropriate, chemical, reactions, the, era, of, the, pharmaceutical, industry, began, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, german, company, bayer, first, manufactured, acetylsalicylic, acid, more, commonly, known, as, aspirin, by, 1910, paul, ehrlich, and, his, laboratory, group, began, developing, arsenic, based, arsphenamine, salvarsan, as, the, first, effective, medicinal, treatment, of, syphilis, and, thereby, initiated, the, medical, practice, of, chemotherapy, ehrlich, popularized, the, concepts, of, magic, bullet, drugs, and, of, systematically, improving, drug, therapies, his, laboratory, made, decisive, contributions, to, developing, antiserum, for, diphtheria, and, standardizing, therapeutic, serums, early, examples, of, organic, reactions, and, applications, were, often, found, because, of, a, combination, of, luck, and, preparation, for, unexpected, observations, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, however, witnessed, systematic, studies, of, organic, compounds, the, development, of, synthetic, indigo, is, illustrative, the, production, of, indigo, from, plant, sources, dropped, from, 19, 000, tons, in, 1897, to, 1, 000, tons, by, 1914, thanks, to, the, synthetic, methods, developed, by, adolf, von, baeyer, in, 2002, 17, 000, tons, of, synthetic, indigo, were, produced, from, petrochemicals, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, polymers, and, enzymes, were, shown, to, be, large, organic, molecules, and, petroleum, was, shown, to, be, of, biological, origin, the, multiple, step, synthesis, of, complex, organic, compounds, is, called, total, synthesis, total, synthesis, of, complex, natural, compounds, increased, in, complexity, to, glucose, and, terpineol, for, example, cholesterol, related, compounds, have, opened, ways, to, synthesize, complex, human, hormones, and, their, modified, derivatives, since, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, complexity, of, total, syntheses, has, been, increased, to, include, molecules, of, high, complexity, such, as, lysergic, acid, and, vitamin, b, 12, the, discovery, of, petroleum, and, the, development, of, the, petrochemical, industry, spurred, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, converting, individual, petroleum, compounds, into, types, of, compounds, by, various, chemical, processes, led, to, organic, reactions, enabling, a, broad, range, of, industrial, and, commercial, products, including, among, many, others, plastics, synthetic, rubber, organic, adhesives, and, various, property, modifying, petroleum, additives, and, catalysts, the, majority, of, chemical, compounds, occurring, in, biological, organisms, are, carbon, compounds, so, the, association, between, organic, chemistry, and, biochemistry, is, so, close, that, biochemistry, might, be, regarded, as, in, essence, a, branch, of, organic, chemistry, although, the, history, of, biochemistry, might, be, taken, to, span, some, four, centuries, fundamental, understanding, of, the, field, only, began, to, develop, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, actual, term, biochemistry, was, coined, around, the, start, of, 20th, century, research, in, the, field, increased, throughout, the, twentieth, century, without, any, indication, of, slackening, in, the, rate, of, increase, as, may, be, verified, by, inspection, of, abstraction, and, indexing, services, such, as, biosis, previews, and, biological, abstracts, which, began, in, the, 1920s, as, a, single, annual, volume, but, has, grown, so, drastically, that, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, only, available, to, the, everyday, user, as, an, online, electronic, database, since, organic, compounds, often, exist, as, mixtures, a, variety, of, techniques, have, also, been, developed, to, assess, purity, chromatography, techniques, are, especially, important, for, this, application, and, include, hplc, and, gas, chromatography, traditional, methods, of, separation, include, distillation, crystallization, evaporation, magnetic, separation, and, solvent, extraction, organic, compounds, were, traditionally, characterized, by, a, variety, of, chemical, tests, called, wet, methods, but, such, tests, have, been, largely, displaced, by, spectroscopic, or, other, computer, intensive, methods, of, analysis, listed, in, approximate, order, of, utility, the, chief, analytical, methods, are, traditional, spectroscopic, methods, such, as, infrared, spectroscopy, optical, rotation, and, uv, vis, spectroscopy, provide, relatively, nonspecific, structural, information, but, remain, in, use, for, specific, applications, refractive, index, and, density, can, also, be, important, for, substance, identification, the, physical, properties, of, organic, compounds, typically, of, interest, include, both, quantitative, and, qualitative, features, quantitative, information, includes, a, melting, point, boiling, point, solubility, and, index, of, refraction, qualitative, properties, include, odor, consistency, and, color, organic, compounds, typically, melt, and, many, boil, in, contrast, while, inorganic, materials, generally, can, be, melted, many, do, not, boil, and, instead, tend, to, degrade, in, earlier, times, the, melting, point, m, p, and, boiling, point, b, p, provided, crucial, information, on, the, purity, and, identity, of, organic, compounds, the, melting, and, boiling, points, correlate, with, the, polarity, of, the, molecules, and, their, molecular, weight, some, organic, compounds, especially, symmetrical, ones, sublime, a, well, known, example, of, a, sublimable, organic, compound, is, para, dichlorobenzene, the, odiferous, constituent, of, modern, mothballs, organic, compounds, are, usually, not, very, stable, at, temperatures, above, 300, c, although, some, exceptions, exist, neutral, organic, compounds, tend, to, be, hydrophobic, that, is, they, are, less, soluble, in, water, than, inorganic, solvents, exceptions, include, organic, compounds, that, contain, ionizable, groups, as, well, as, low, molecular, weight, alcohols, amines, and, carboxylic, acids, where, hydrogen, bonding, occurs, otherwise, organic, compounds, tend, to, dissolve, in, organic, solvents, solubility, varies, widely, with, the, organic, solute, and, with, the, organic, solvent, various, specialized, properties, of, molecular, crystals, and, organic, polymers, with, conjugated, systems, are, of, interest, depending, on, applications, e, g, thermo, mechanical, and, electro, mechanical, such, as, piezoelectricity, electrical, conductivity, see, conductive, polymers, and, organic, semiconductors, and, electro, optical, e, g, non, linear, optics, properties, for, historical, reasons, such, properties, are, mainly, the, subjects, of, the, areas, of, polymer, science, and, materials, science, the, names, of, organic, compounds, are, either, systematic, following, logically, from, a, set, of, rules, or, nonsystematic, following, various, traditions, systematic, nomenclature, is, stipulated, by, specifications, from, iupac, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, systematic, nomenclature, starts, with, the, name, for, a, parent, structure, within, the, molecule, of, interest, this, parent, name, is, then, modified, by, prefixes, suffixes, and, numbers, to, unambiguously, convey, the, structure, given, that, millions, of, organic, compounds, are, known, rigorous, use, of, systematic, names, can, be, cumbersome, thus, iupac, recommendations, are, more, closely, followed, for, simple, compounds, but, not, complex, molecules, to, use, the, systematic, naming, one, must, know, the, structures, and, names, of, the, parent, structures, parent, structures, include, unsubstituted, hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and, mono, functionalized, derivatives, thereof, nonsystematic, nomenclature, is, simpler, and, unambiguous, at, least, to, organic, chemists, nonsystematic, names, do, not, indicate, the, structure, of, the, compound, they, are, common, for, complex, molecules, which, include, most, natural, products, thus, the, informally, named, lysergic, acid, diethylamide, is, systematically, named, 6a, r, 9, r, n, n, diethyl, 7, methyl, 4, 6, 6a, 7, 8, 9, hexahydroindolo, quinoline, 9, carboxamide, with, the, increased, use, of, computing, other, naming, methods, have, evolved, that, are, intended, to, be, interpreted, by, machines, two, popular, formats, are, smiles, and, inchi, organic, molecules, are, described, more, commonly, by, drawings, or, structural, formulas, combinations, of, drawings, and, chemical, symbols, the, line, angle, formula, is, simple, and, unambiguous, in, this, system, the, endpoints, and, intersections, of, each, line, represent, one, carbon, and, hydrogen, atoms, can, either, be, notated, explicitly, or, assumed, to, be, present, as, implied, by, tetravalent, carbon, by, 1880, an, explosion, in, the, number, of, chemical, compounds, being, discovered, occurred, assisted, by, new, synthetic, and, analytical, techniques, grignard, described, the, situation, as, chaos, le, plus, complet, complete, chaos, due, to, the, lack, of, convention, it, was, possible, to, have, multiple, names, for, the, same, compound, this, led, to, the, creation, of, the, geneva, rules, in, 1892, the, concept, of, functional, groups, is, central, in, organic, chemistry, both, as, a, means, to, classify, structures, and, for, predicting, properties, a, functional, group, is, a, molecular, module, and, the, reactivity, of, that, functional, group, is, assumed, within, limits, to, be, the, same, in, a, variety, of, molecules, functional, groups, can, have, a, decisive, influence, on, the, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, organic, compounds, molecules, are, classified, based, on, their, functional, groups, alcohols, for, example, all, have, the, subunit, c, o, h, all, alcohols, tend, to, be, somewhat, hydrophilic, usually, form, esters, and, usually, can, be, converted, to, the, corresponding, halides, most, functional, groups, feature, heteroatoms, atoms, other, than, c, and, h, organic, compounds, are, classified, according, to, functional, groups, alcohols, carboxylic, acids, amines, etc, functional, groups, make, the, molecule, more, acidic, or, basic, due, to, their, electronic, influence, on, surrounding, parts, of, the, molecule, as, the, p, k, a, aka, basicity, of, the, molecular, addition, functional, group, increases, there, is, a, corresponding, dipole, when, measured, increases, in, strength, a, dipole, directed, towards, the, functional, group, higher, p, k, a, therefore, basic, nature, of, group, points, towards, it, and, decreases, in, strength, with, increasing, distance, dipole, distance, measured, in, angstroms, and, steric, hindrance, towards, the, functional, group, have, an, intermolecular, and, intramolecular, effect, on, the, surrounding, environment, and, ph, level, different, functional, groups, have, different, p, k, a, values, and, bond, strengths, single, double, triple, leading, to, increased, electrophilicity, with, lower, p, k, a, and, increased, nucleophile, strength, with, higher, p, k, a, more, basic, nucleophilic, functional, groups, desire, to, attack, an, electrophilic, functional, group, with, a, lower, p, k, a, on, another, molecule, intermolecular, or, within, the, same, molecule, intramolecular, any, group, with, a, net, acidic, p, k, a, that, gets, within, range, such, as, an, acyl, or, carbonyl, group, is, fair, game, since, the, likelihood, of, being, attacked, decreases, with, an, increase, in, p, k, a, acyl, chloride, components, with, the, lowest, measured, p, k, a, values, are, most, likely, to, be, attacked, followed, by, carboxylic, acids, p, k, a, 4, thiols, 13, malonates, 13, alcohols, 17, aldehydes, 20, nitriles, 25, esters, 25, then, amines, 35, amines, are, very, basic, and, are, great, nucleophiles, attackers, the, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, are, subdivided, into, three, groups, of, homologous, series, according, to, their, state, of, saturation, the, rest, of, the, group, is, classified, according, to, the, functional, groups, present, such, compounds, can, be, straight, chain, branched, chain, or, cyclic, the, degree, of, branching, affects, characteristics, such, as, the, octane, number, or, cetane, number, in, petroleum, chemistry, both, saturated, alicyclic, compounds, and, unsaturated, compounds, exist, as, cyclic, derivatives, the, most, stable, rings, contain, five, or, six, carbon, atoms, but, large, rings, macrocycles, and, smaller, rings, are, common, the, smallest, cycloalkane, family, is, the, three, membered, cyclopropane, ch, 2, 3, saturated, cyclic, compounds, contain, single, bonds, only, whereas, aromatic, rings, have, an, alternating, or, conjugated, double, bond, cycloalkanes, do, not, contain, multiple, bonds, whereas, the, cycloalkenes, and, the, cycloalkynes, do, aromatic, hydrocarbons, contain, conjugated, double, bonds, this, means, that, every, carbon, atom, in, the, ring, is, sp2, hybridized, allowing, for, added, stability, the, most, important, example, is, benzene, the, structure, of, which, was, formulated, by, kekul, who, first, proposed, the, delocalization, or, resonance, principle, for, explaining, its, structure, for, conventional, cyclic, compounds, aromaticity, is, conferred, by, the, presence, of, 4n, 2, delocalized, pi, electrons, where, n, is, an, integer, particular, instability, antiaromaticity, is, conferred, by, the, presence, of, 4n, conjugated, pi, electrons, the, characteristics, of, the, cyclic, hydrocarbons, are, again, altered, if, heteroatoms, are, present, which, can, exist, as, either, substituents, attached, externally, to, the, ring, exocyclic, or, as, a, member, of, the, ring, itself, endocyclic, in, the, case, of, the, latter, the, ring, is, termed, a, heterocycle, pyridine, and, furan, are, examples, of, aromatic, heterocycles, while, piperidine, and, tetrahydrofuran, are, the, corresponding, alicyclic, heterocycles, the, heteroatom, of, heterocyclic, molecules, is, generally, oxygen, sulfur, or, nitrogen, with, the, latter, being, particularly, common, in, biochemical, systems, heterocycles, are, commonly, found, in, a, wide, range, of, products, including, aniline, dyes, and, medicines, additionally, they, are, prevalent, in, a, wide, range, of, biochemical, compounds, such, as, alkaloids, vitamins, steroids, and, nucleic, acids, e, g, dna, rna, rings, can, fuse, with, other, rings, on, an, edge, to, give, polycyclic, compounds, the, purine, nucleoside, bases, are, notable, polycyclic, aromatic, heterocycles, rings, can, also, fuse, on, a, corner, such, that, one, atom, almost, always, carbon, has, two, bonds, going, to, one, ring, and, two, to, another, such, compounds, are, termed, spiro, and, are, important, in, several, natural, products, one, important, property, of, carbon, is, that, it, readily, forms, chains, or, networks, that, are, linked, by, carbon, carbon, carbon, to, carbon, bonds, the, linking, process, is, called, polymerization, while, the, chains, or, networks, are, called, polymers, the, source, compound, is, called, a, monomer, two, main, groups, of, polymers, exist, synthetic, polymers, and, biopolymers, synthetic, polymers, are, artificially, manufactured, and, are, commonly, referred, to, as, industrial, polymers, biopolymers, occur, within, a, respectfully, natural, environment, or, without, human, intervention, biomolecular, chemistry, is, a, major, category, within, organic, chemistry, which, is, frequently, studied, by, biochemists, many, complex, multi, functional, group, molecules, are, important, in, living, organisms, some, are, long, chain, biopolymers, and, these, include, peptides, dna, rna, and, the, polysaccharides, such, as, starches, in, animals, and, celluloses, in, plants, the, other, main, classes, are, amino, acids, monomer, building, blocks, of, peptides, and, proteins, carbohydrates, which, includes, the, polysaccharides, the, nucleic, acids, which, include, dna, and, rna, as, polymers, and, the, lipids, besides, animal, biochemistry, contains, many, small, molecule, intermediates, which, assist, in, energy, production, through, the, krebs, cycle, and, produces, isoprene, the, most, common, hydrocarbon, in, animals, isoprenes, in, animals, form, the, important, steroid, structural, cholesterol, and, steroid, hormone, compounds, and, in, plants, form, terpenes, terpenoids, some, alkaloids, and, a, class, of, hydrocarbons, called, biopolymer, polyisoprenoids, present, in, the, latex, of, various, species, of, plants, which, is, the, basis, for, making, rubber, biologists, usually, classify, the, above, mentioned, biomolecules, into, four, main, groups, i, e, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and, nucleic, acids, petroleum, and, its, derivatives, are, considered, organic, molecules, which, is, consistent, with, the, fact, that, this, oil, comes, from, the, fossilization, of, living, beings, i, e, biomolecules, see, also, peptide, synthesis, oligonucleotide, synthesis, and, carbohydrate, synthesis, in, pharmacology, an, important, group, of, organic, compounds, is, small, molecules, also, referred, to, as, small, organic, compounds, in, this, context, a, small, molecule, is, a, small, organic, compound, that, is, biologically, active, but, is, not, a, polymer, in, practice, small, molecules, have, a, molar, mass, less, than, approximately, 1000, g, mol, fullerenes, and, carbon, nanotubes, carbon, compounds, with, spheroidal, and, tubular, structures, have, stimulated, much, research, into, the, related, field, of, materials, science, the, first, fullerene, was, discovered, in, 1985, by, sir, harold, w, kroto, of, the, united, kingdom, and, by, richard, e, smalley, and, robert, f, curl, jr, of, the, united, states, using, a, laser, to, vaporize, graphite, rods, in, an, atmosphere, of, helium, gas, these, chemists, and, their, assistants, obtained, cagelike, molecules, composed, of, 60, carbon, atoms, c60, joined, by, single, and, double, bonds, to, form, a, hollow, sphere, with, 12, pentagonal, and, 20, hexagonal, faces, a, design, that, resembles, a, football, or, soccer, ball, in, 1996, the, trio, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, their, pioneering, efforts, the, c60, molecule, was, named, buckminsterfullerene, or, more, simply, the, buckyball, after, the, american, architect, r, buckminster, fuller, whose, geodesic, dome, is, constructed, on, the, same, structural, principles, organic, compounds, containing, bonds, of, carbon, to, nitrogen, oxygen, and, the, halogens, are, not, normally, grouped, separately, others, are, sometimes, put, into, major, groups, within, organic, chemistry, and, discussed, under, titles, such, as, organosulfur, chemistry, organometallic, chemistry, organophosphorus, chemistry, and, organosilicon, chemistry, organic, reactions, are, chemical, reactions, involving, organic, compounds, many, of, these, reactions, are, associated, with, functional, groups, the, general, theory, of, these, reactions, involves, careful, analysis, of, such, properties, as, the, electron, affinity, of, key, atoms, bond, strengths, and, steric, hindrance, these, factors, can, determine, the, relative, stability, of, short, lived, reactive, intermediates, which, usually, directly, determine, the, path, of, the, reaction, the, basic, reaction, types, are, addition, reactions, elimination, reactions, substitution, reactions, pericyclic, reactions, rearrangement, reactions, and, redox, reactions, an, example, of, a, common, reaction, is, a, substitution, reaction, written, as, where, x, is, some, functional, group, and, nu, is, a, nucleophile, the, number, of, possible, organic, reactions, is, infinite, however, certain, general, patterns, are, observed, that, can, be, used, to, describe, many, common, or, useful, reactions, each, reaction, has, a, stepwise, reaction, mechanism, that, explains, how, it, happens, in, sequence, although, the, detailed, description, of, steps, is, not, always, clear, from, a, list, of, reactants, alone, the, stepwise, course, of, any, given, reaction, mechanism, can, be, represented, using, arrow, pushing, techniques, in, which, curved, arrows, are, used, to, track, the, movement, of, electrons, as, starting, materials, transition, through, intermediates, to, final, products, synthetic, organic, chemistry, is, an, applied, science, as, it, borders, engineering, the, design, analysis, and, or, construction, of, works, for, practical, purposes, organic, synthesis, of, a, novel, compound, is, a, problem, solving, task, where, a, synthesis, is, designed, for, a, target, molecule, by, selecting, optimal, reactions, from, optimal, starting, materials, complex, compounds, can, have, tens, of, reaction, steps, that, sequentially, build, the, desired, molecule, the, synthesis, proceeds, by, utilizing, the, reactivity, of, the, functional, groups, in, the, molecule, for, example, a, carbonyl, compound, can, be, used, as, a, nucleophile, by, converting, it, into, an, enolate, or, as, an, electrophile, the, combination, of, the, two, is, called, the, aldol, reaction, designing, practically, useful, syntheses, always, requires, conducting, the, actual, synthesis, in, the, laboratory, the, scientific, practice, of, creating, novel, synthetic, routes, for, complex, molecules, is, called, total, synthesis, strategies, to, design, a, synthesis, include, retrosynthesis, popularized, by, e, j, corey, which, starts, with, the, target, molecule, and, splices, it, to, pieces, according, to, known, reactions, the, pieces, or, the, proposed, precursors, receive, the, same, treatment, until, available, and, ideally, inexpensive, starting, materials, are, reached, then, the, retrosynthesis, is, written, in, the, opposite, direction, to, give, the, synthesis, a, synthetic, tree, can, be, constructed, because, each, compound, and, also, each, precursor, has, multiple, syntheses
