thorium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, the, symbol, th, and, atomic, number, 90, thorium, is, a, weakly, radioactive, light, silver, metal, which, tarnishes, olive, gray, when, it, is, exposed, to, air, forming, thorium, dioxide, it, is, moderately, soft, and, malleable, and, has, a, high, melting, point, thorium, is, an, electropositive, actinide, whose, chemistry, is, dominated, by, the, 4, oxidation, state, it, is, quite, reactive, and, can, ignite, in, air, when, finely, divided, all, known, thorium, isotopes, are, unstable, the, most, stable, isotope, 232, th, has, a, half, life, of, 14, 05, billion, years, or, about, the, age, of, the, universe, it, decays, very, slowly, via, alpha, decay, starting, a, decay, chain, named, the, thorium, series, that, ends, at, stable, 208, pb, on, earth, thorium, and, uranium, are, the, only, elements, with, no, stable, or, nearly, stable, isotopes, that, still, occur, naturally, in, large, quantities, as, primordial, elements, thorium, is, estimated, to, be, over, three, times, as, abundant, as, uranium, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, is, chiefly, refined, from, monazite, sands, as, a, by, product, of, extracting, rare, earth, metals, thorium, was, discovered, in, 1828, by, the, norwegian, amateur, mineralogist, morten, thrane, esmark, and, identified, by, the, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, who, named, it, after, thor, the, norse, god, of, thunder, its, first, applications, were, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, thorium, s, radioactivity, was, widely, acknowledged, during, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, thorium, was, replaced, in, many, uses, due, to, concerns, about, its, radioactivity, thorium, is, still, being, used, as, an, alloying, element, in, tig, welding, electrodes, but, is, slowly, being, replaced, in, the, field, with, different, compositions, it, was, also, material, in, high, end, optics, and, scientific, instrumentation, used, in, some, broadcast, vacuum, tubes, and, as, the, light, source, in, gas, mantles, but, these, uses, have, become, marginal, it, has, been, suggested, as, a, replacement, for, uranium, as, nuclear, fuel, in, nuclear, reactors, and, several, thorium, reactors, have, been, built, thorium, is, also, used, in, strengthening, magnesium, coating, tungsten, wire, in, electrical, equipment, controlling, the, grain, size, of, tungsten, in, electric, lamps, high, temperature, crucibles, and, glasses, including, camera, and, scientific, instrument, lenses, other, uses, for, thorium, include, heat, resistant, ceramics, aircraft, engines, and, in, light, bulbs, ocean, science, has, utilised, 231, pa, 230, th, isotope, ratios, to, understand, the, ancient, ocean, thorium, is, a, moderately, soft, paramagnetic, bright, silvery, radioactive, actinide, metal, that, can, be, bent, or, shaped, in, the, periodic, table, it, lies, to, the, right, of, actinium, to, the, left, of, protactinium, and, below, cerium, pure, thorium, is, very, ductile, and, as, normal, for, metals, can, be, cold, rolled, swaged, and, drawn, at, room, temperature, thorium, metal, has, a, face, centred, cubic, crystal, structure, it, has, two, other, forms, one, at, high, temperature, over, 1360, c, body, centred, cubic, and, one, at, high, pressure, around, 100, gpa, body, centred, tetragonal, thorium, metal, has, a, bulk, modulus, a, measure, of, resistance, to, compression, of, a, material, of, 54, gpa, about, the, same, as, tin, s, 58, 2, gpa, aluminium, s, is, 75, 2, gpa, copper, s, 137, 8, gpa, and, mild, steel, s, is, 160, 169, gpa, thorium, is, about, as, hard, as, soft, steel, so, when, heated, it, can, be, rolled, into, sheets, and, pulled, into, wire, thorium, is, nearly, half, as, dense, as, uranium, and, plutonium, and, is, harder, than, both, it, becomes, superconductive, below, 1, 4, k, thorium, s, melting, point, of, 1750, c, is, above, both, those, of, actinium, 1227, c, and, protactinium, 1568, c, at, the, start, of, period, 7, from, francium, to, thorium, the, melting, points, of, the, elements, increase, as, in, other, periods, because, the, number, of, delocalised, electrons, each, atom, contributes, increases, from, one, in, francium, to, four, in, thorium, leading, to, greater, attraction, between, these, electrons, and, the, metal, ions, as, their, charge, increases, from, one, to, four, after, thorium, there, is, a, new, downward, trend, in, melting, points, from, thorium, to, plutonium, where, the, number, of, f, electrons, increases, from, about, 0, 4, to, about, 6, this, trend, is, due, to, the, increasing, hybridisation, of, the, 5f, and, 6d, orbitals, and, the, formation, of, directional, bonds, resulting, in, more, complex, crystal, structures, and, weakened, metallic, bonding, the, f, electron, count, for, thorium, metal, is, a, non, integer, due, to, a, 5f, 6d, overlap, among, the, actinides, up, to, californium, which, can, be, studied, in, at, least, milligram, quantities, thorium, has, the, highest, melting, and, boiling, points, and, second, lowest, density, only, actinium, is, lighter, thorium, s, boiling, point, of, 4788, c, is, the, fifth, highest, among, all, the, elements, with, known, boiling, points, the, properties, of, thorium, vary, widely, depending, on, the, degree, of, impurities, in, the, sample, the, major, impurity, is, usually, thorium, dioxide, tho, 2, even, the, purest, thorium, specimens, usually, contain, about, a, tenth, of, a, percent, of, the, dioxide, experimental, measurements, of, its, density, give, values, between, 11, 5, and, 11, 66, g, cm, 3, these, are, slightly, lower, than, the, theoretically, expected, value, of, 11, 7, g, cm, 3, calculated, from, thorium, s, lattice, parameters, perhaps, due, to, microscopic, voids, forming, in, the, metal, when, it, is, cast, these, values, lie, between, those, of, its, neighbours, actinium, 10, 1, g, cm, 3, and, protactinium, 15, 4, g, cm, 3, part, of, a, trend, across, the, early, actinides, thorium, can, form, alloys, with, many, other, metals, addition, of, small, proportions, of, thorium, improves, the, mechanical, strength, of, magnesium, and, thorium, aluminium, alloys, have, been, considered, as, a, way, to, store, thorium, in, proposed, future, thorium, nuclear, reactors, thorium, forms, eutectic, mixtures, with, chromium, and, uranium, and, it, is, completely, miscible, in, both, solid, and, liquid, states, with, its, lighter, congener, cerium, all, but, two, elements, up, to, bismuth, element, 83, have, an, isotope, that, is, practically, stable, for, all, purposes, classically, stable, with, the, exceptions, being, technetium, and, promethium, elements, 43, and, 61, all, elements, from, polonium, element, 84, onward, are, measurably, radioactive, 232, th, is, one, of, the, two, nuclides, beyond, bismuth, the, other, being, 238, u, that, have, half, lives, measured, in, billions, of, years, its, half, life, is, 14, 05, billion, years, about, three, times, the, age, of, the, earth, and, slightly, longer, than, the, age, of, the, universe, four, fifths, of, the, thorium, present, at, earth, s, formation, has, survived, to, the, present, 232, th, is, the, only, isotope, of, thorium, occurring, in, quantity, in, nature, its, stability, is, attributed, to, its, closed, nuclear, subshell, with, 142, neutrons, thorium, has, a, characteristic, terrestrial, isotopic, composition, with, atomic, weight, 232, 0377, 0, 0004, it, is, one, of, only, four, radioactive, elements, along, with, bismuth, protactinium, and, uranium, that, occur, in, large, enough, quantities, on, earth, for, a, standard, atomic, weight, to, be, determined, thorium, nuclei, are, susceptible, to, alpha, decay, because, the, strong, nuclear, force, cannot, overcome, the, electromagnetic, repulsion, between, their, protons, the, alpha, decay, of, 232, th, initiates, the, 4, n, decay, chain, which, includes, isotopes, with, a, mass, number, divisible, by, 4, hence, the, name, it, is, also, called, the, thorium, series, after, its, progenitor, this, chain, of, consecutive, alpha, and, beta, decays, begins, with, the, decay, of, 232, th, to, 228, ra, and, terminates, at, 208, pb, any, sample, of, thorium, or, its, compounds, contains, traces, of, these, daughters, which, are, isotopes, of, thallium, lead, bismuth, polonium, radon, radium, and, actinium, natural, thorium, samples, can, be, chemically, purified, to, extract, useful, daughter, nuclides, such, as, 212, pb, which, is, used, in, nuclear, medicine, for, cancer, therapy, 227, th, alpha, emitter, with, an, 18, 68, days, half, life, can, also, be, used, in, cancer, treatments, such, as, targeted, alpha, therapies, 232, th, also, very, occasionally, undergoes, spontaneous, fission, rather, than, alpha, decay, and, has, left, evidence, of, doing, so, in, its, minerals, as, trapped, xenon, gas, formed, as, a, fission, product, but, the, partial, half, life, of, this, process, is, very, large, at, over, 10, 21, years, and, alpha, decay, predominates, in, total, 32, radioisotopes, have, been, characterised, which, range, in, mass, number, from, 207, to, 238, after, 232, th, the, most, stable, of, them, with, respective, half, lives, are, 230, th, 75, 380, years, 229, th, 7, 917, years, 228, th, 1, 92, years, 234, th, 24, 10, days, and, 227, th, 18, 68, days, all, of, these, isotopes, occur, in, nature, as, trace, radioisotopes, due, to, their, presence, in, the, decay, chains, of, 232, th, 235, u, 238, u, and, 237, np, the, last, of, these, is, long, extinct, in, nature, due, to, its, short, half, life, 2, 14, million, years, but, is, continually, produced, in, minute, traces, from, neutron, capture, in, uranium, ores, all, of, the, remaining, thorium, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, thirty, days, and, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, ten, minutes, 233, th, half, life, 22, minutes, occurs, naturally, as, the, result, of, neutron, activation, of, natural, 232, th, 226, th, half, life, 31, minutes, has, not, yet, been, observed, in, nature, but, would, be, produced, by, the, still, unobserved, double, beta, decay, of, natural, 226, ra, in, deep, seawaters, the, isotope, 230, th, makes, up, to, 0, 02, of, natural, thorium, this, is, because, its, parent, 238, u, is, soluble, in, water, but, 230, th, is, insoluble, and, precipitates, into, the, sediment, uranium, ores, with, low, thorium, concentrations, can, be, purified, to, produce, gram, sized, thorium, samples, of, which, over, a, quarter, is, the, 230, th, isotope, since, 230, th, is, one, of, the, daughters, of, 238, u, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, reclassified, thorium, as, a, binuclidic, element, in, 2013, it, had, formerly, been, considered, a, mononuclidic, element, thorium, has, three, known, nuclear, isomers, or, metastable, states, 216m1, th, 216m2, th, and, 229m, th, 229m, th, has, the, lowest, known, excitation, energy, of, any, isomer, measured, to, be, 7, 6, 0, 5, ev, this, is, so, low, that, when, it, undergoes, isomeric, transition, the, emitted, gamma, radiation, is, in, the, ultraviolet, range, the, nuclear, transition, from, 229, th, to, 229m, th, is, being, investigated, for, a, nuclear, clock, different, isotopes, of, thorium, are, chemically, identical, but, have, slightly, differing, physical, properties, for, example, the, densities, of, pure, 228, th, 229, th, 230, th, and, 232, th, are, respectively, expected, to, be, 11, 5, 11, 6, 11, 6, and, 11, 7, g, cm, 3, the, isotope, 229, th, is, expected, to, be, fissionable, with, a, bare, critical, mass, of, 2839, kg, although, with, steel, reflectors, this, value, could, drop, to, 994, kg, 232, th, is, not, fissionable, but, it, is, fertile, as, it, can, be, converted, to, fissile, 233, u, by, neutron, capture, and, subsequent, beta, decay, two, radiometric, dating, methods, involve, thorium, isotopes, uranium, thorium, dating, based, on, the, decay, of, 234, u, to, 230, th, and, ionium, thorium, dating, which, measures, the, ratio, of, 232, th, to, 230, th, these, rely, on, the, fact, that, 232, th, is, a, primordial, radioisotope, but, 230, th, only, occurs, as, an, intermediate, decay, product, in, the, decay, chain, of, 238, u, uranium, thorium, dating, is, a, relatively, short, range, process, because, of, the, short, half, lives, of, 234, u, and, 230, th, relative, to, the, age, of, the, earth, it, is, also, accompanied, by, a, sister, process, involving, the, alpha, decay, of, 235, u, into, 231, th, which, very, quickly, becomes, the, longer, lived, 231, pa, and, this, process, is, often, used, to, check, the, results, of, uranium, thorium, dating, uranium, thorium, dating, is, commonly, used, to, determine, the, age, of, calcium, carbonate, materials, such, as, speleothem, or, coral, because, uranium, is, more, soluble, in, water, than, thorium, and, protactinium, which, are, selectively, precipitated, into, ocean, floor, sediments, where, their, ratios, are, measured, the, scheme, has, a, range, of, several, hundred, thousand, years, ionium, thorium, dating, is, a, related, process, which, exploits, the, insolubility, of, thorium, both, 232, th, and, 230, th, and, thus, its, presence, in, ocean, sediments, to, date, these, sediments, by, measuring, the, ratio, of, 232, th, to, 230, th, both, of, these, dating, methods, assume, that, the, proportion, of, 230, th, to, 232, th, is, a, constant, during, the, period, when, the, sediment, layer, was, formed, that, the, sediment, did, not, already, contain, thorium, before, contributions, from, the, decay, of, uranium, and, that, the, thorium, cannot, migrate, within, the, sediment, layer, a, thorium, atom, has, 90, electrons, of, which, four, are, valence, electrons, four, atomic, orbitals, are, theoretically, available, for, the, valence, electrons, to, occupy, 5f, 6d, 7s, and, 7p, despite, thorium, s, position, in, the, f, block, of, the, periodic, table, it, has, an, anomalous, 6d, 2, 7s, 2, electron, configuration, in, the, ground, state, as, the, 5f, and, 6d, subshells, in, the, early, actinides, are, very, close, in, energy, even, more, so, than, the, 4f, and, 5d, subshells, of, the, lanthanides, thorium, s, 6d, subshells, are, lower, in, energy, than, its, 5f, subshells, because, its, 5f, subshells, are, not, well, shielded, by, the, filled, 6s, and, 6p, subshells, and, are, destabilized, this, is, due, to, relativistic, effects, which, become, stronger, near, the, bottom, of, the, periodic, table, specifically, the, relativistic, spin, orbit, interaction, the, closeness, in, energy, levels, of, the, 5f, 6d, and, 7s, energy, levels, of, thorium, results, in, thorium, almost, always, losing, all, four, valence, electrons, and, occurring, in, its, highest, possible, oxidation, state, of, 4, this, is, different, from, its, lanthanide, congener, cerium, in, which, 4, is, also, the, highest, possible, state, but, 3, plays, an, important, role, and, is, more, stable, thorium, is, much, more, similar, to, the, transition, metals, zirconium, and, hafnium, than, to, cerium, in, its, ionization, energies, and, redox, potentials, and, hence, also, in, its, chemistry, this, transition, metal, like, behaviour, is, the, norm, in, the, first, half, of, the, actinide, series, from, actinium, to, americium, despite, the, anomalous, electron, configuration, for, gaseous, thorium, atoms, metallic, thorium, shows, significant, 5f, involvement, a, hypothetical, metallic, state, of, thorium, that, had, the, 6d, 2, 7s, 2, configuration, with, the, 5f, orbitals, above, the, fermi, level, should, be, hexagonal, close, packed, like, the, group, 4, elements, titanium, zirconium, and, hafnium, and, not, face, centred, cubic, as, it, actually, is, the, actual, crystal, structure, can, only, be, explained, when, the, 5f, states, are, invoked, proving, that, thorium, is, metallurgically, a, true, actinide, tetravalent, thorium, compounds, are, usually, colourless, or, yellow, like, those, of, silver, or, lead, as, the, th, 4, ion, has, no, 5f, or, 6d, electrons, thorium, chemistry, is, therefore, largely, that, of, an, electropositive, metal, forming, a, single, diamagnetic, ion, with, a, stable, noble, gas, configuration, indicating, a, similarity, between, thorium, and, the, main, group, elements, of, the, s, block, thorium, and, uranium, are, the, most, investigated, of, the, radioactive, elements, because, their, radioactivity, is, low, enough, not, to, require, special, handling, in, the, laboratory, thorium, is, a, highly, reactive, and, electropositive, metal, with, a, standard, reduction, potential, of, 1, 90, v, for, the, th, 4, th, couple, it, is, somewhat, more, electropositive, than, zirconium, or, aluminium, finely, divided, thorium, metal, can, exhibit, pyrophoricity, spontaneously, igniting, in, air, when, heated, in, air, thorium, turnings, ignite, and, burn, with, a, brilliant, white, light, to, produce, the, dioxide, in, bulk, the, reaction, of, pure, thorium, with, air, is, slow, although, corrosion, may, occur, after, several, months, most, thorium, samples, are, contaminated, with, varying, degrees, of, the, dioxide, which, greatly, accelerates, corrosion, such, samples, slowly, tarnish, becoming, grey, and, finally, black, at, the, surface, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, thorium, is, slowly, attacked, by, water, but, does, not, readily, dissolve, in, most, common, acids, with, the, exception, of, hydrochloric, acid, where, it, dissolves, leaving, a, black, insoluble, residue, of, tho, oh, cl, h, it, dissolves, in, concentrated, nitric, acid, containing, a, small, quantity, of, catalytic, fluoride, or, fluorosilicate, ions, if, these, are, not, present, passivation, by, the, nitrate, can, occur, as, with, uranium, and, plutonium, most, binary, compounds, of, thorium, with, nonmetals, may, be, prepared, by, heating, the, elements, together, in, air, thorium, burns, to, form, tho, 2, which, has, the, fluorite, structure, thorium, dioxide, is, a, refractory, material, with, the, highest, melting, point, 3390, c, of, any, known, oxide, it, is, somewhat, hygroscopic, and, reacts, readily, with, water, and, many, gases, it, dissolves, easily, in, concentrated, nitric, acid, in, the, presence, of, fluoride, when, heated, in, air, thorium, dioxide, emits, intense, blue, light, the, light, becomes, white, when, tho, 2, is, mixed, with, its, lighter, homologue, cerium, dioxide, ceo, 2, ceria, this, is, the, basis, for, its, previously, common, application, in, gas, mantles, a, flame, is, not, necessary, for, this, effect, in, 1901, it, was, discovered, that, a, hot, welsbach, gas, mantle, using, tho, 2, with, 1, ceo, 2, remained, at, full, glow, when, exposed, to, a, cold, unignited, mixture, of, flammable, gas, and, air, the, light, emitted, by, thorium, dioxide, is, higher, in, wavelength, than, the, blackbody, emission, expected, from, incandescence, at, the, same, temperature, an, effect, called, candoluminescence, it, occurs, because, tho, 2, ce, acts, as, a, catalyst, for, the, recombination, of, free, radicals, that, appear, in, high, concentration, in, a, flame, whose, deexcitation, releases, large, amounts, of, energy, the, addition, of, 1, cerium, dioxide, as, in, gas, mantles, heightens, the, effect, by, increasing, emissivity, in, the, visible, region, of, the, spectrum, but, because, cerium, unlike, thorium, can, occur, in, multiple, oxidation, states, its, charge, and, hence, visible, emissivity, will, depend, on, the, region, on, the, flame, it, is, found, in, as, such, regions, vary, in, their, chemical, composition, and, hence, how, oxidising, or, reducing, they, are, several, binary, thorium, chalcogenides, and, oxychalcogenides, are, also, known, with, sulfur, selenium, and, tellurium, all, four, thorium, tetrahalides, are, known, as, are, some, low, valent, bromides, and, iodides, the, tetrahalides, are, all, 8, coordinated, hygroscopic, compounds, that, dissolve, easily, in, polar, solvents, such, as, water, many, related, polyhalide, ions, are, also, known, thorium, tetrafluoride, has, a, monoclinic, crystal, structure, like, those, of, zirconium, tetrafluoride, and, hafnium, tetrafluoride, where, the, th, 4, ions, are, coordinated, with, f, ions, in, somewhat, distorted, square, antiprisms, the, other, tetrahalides, instead, have, dodecahedral, geometry, lower, iodides, thi, 3, black, and, thi, 2, gold, coloured, can, also, be, prepared, by, reducing, the, tetraiodide, with, thorium, metal, they, do, not, contain, th, iii, and, th, ii, but, instead, contain, th, 4, and, could, be, more, clearly, formulated, as, electride, compounds, many, polynary, halides, with, the, alkali, metals, barium, thallium, and, ammonium, are, known, for, thorium, fluorides, chlorides, and, bromides, for, example, when, treated, with, potassium, fluoride, and, hydrofluoric, acid, th, 4, forms, the, complex, anion, 2, hexafluorothorate, iv, which, precipitates, as, an, insoluble, salt, k, 2, potassium, hexafluorothorate, iv, thorium, borides, carbides, silicides, and, nitrides, are, refractory, materials, like, those, of, uranium, and, plutonium, and, have, thus, received, attention, as, possible, nuclear, fuels, all, four, heavier, pnictogens, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and, bismuth, also, form, binary, thorium, compounds, thorium, germanides, are, also, known, thorium, reacts, with, hydrogen, to, form, the, thorium, hydrides, thh, 2, and, th, 4, h, 15, the, latter, of, which, is, superconducting, below, 7, 5, 8, k, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, it, conducts, electricity, like, a, metal, the, hydrides, are, thermally, unstable, and, readily, decompose, upon, exposure, to, air, or, moisture, in, an, acidic, aqueous, solution, thorium, occurs, as, the, tetrapositive, aqua, ion, 4, which, has, tricapped, trigonal, prismatic, molecular, geometry, at, ph, 3, the, solutions, of, thorium, salts, are, dominated, by, this, cation, the, th, 4, ion, is, the, largest, of, the, tetrapositive, actinide, ions, and, depending, on, the, coordination, number, can, have, a, radius, between, 0, 95, and, 1, 14, it, is, quite, acidic, due, to, its, high, charge, slightly, stronger, than, sulfurous, acid, thus, it, tends, to, undergo, hydrolysis, and, polymerisation, though, to, a, lesser, extent, than, fe, 3, predominantly, to, 6, in, solutions, with, ph, 3, or, below, but, in, more, alkaline, solution, polymerisation, continues, until, the, gelatinous, hydroxide, th, oh, 4, forms, and, precipitates, out, though, equilibrium, may, take, weeks, to, be, reached, because, the, polymerisation, usually, slows, down, before, the, precipitation, as, a, hard, lewis, acid, th, 4, favours, hard, ligands, with, oxygen, atoms, as, donors, complexes, with, sulfur, atoms, as, donors, are, less, stable, and, are, more, prone, to, hydrolysis, high, coordination, numbers, are, the, rule, for, thorium, due, to, its, large, size, thorium, nitrate, pentahydrate, was, the, first, known, example, of, coordination, number, 11, the, oxalate, tetrahydrate, has, coordination, number, 10, and, the, borohydride, first, prepared, in, the, manhattan, project, has, coordination, number, 14, these, thorium, salts, are, known, for, their, high, solubility, in, water, and, polar, organic, solvents, many, other, inorganic, thorium, compounds, with, polyatomic, anions, are, known, such, as, the, perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and, chromates, and, their, hydrated, forms, they, are, important, in, thorium, purification, and, the, disposal, of, nuclear, waste, but, most, of, them, have, not, yet, been, fully, characterized, especially, regarding, their, structural, properties, for, example, thorium, nitrate, is, produced, by, reacting, thorium, hydroxide, with, nitric, acid, it, is, soluble, in, water, and, alcohols, and, is, an, important, intermediate, in, the, purification, of, thorium, and, its, compounds, thorium, complexes, with, organic, ligands, such, as, oxalate, citrate, and, edta, are, much, more, stable, in, natural, thorium, containing, waters, organic, thorium, complexes, usually, occur, in, concentrations, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, the, inorganic, complexes, even, when, the, concentrations, of, inorganic, ligands, are, much, greater, than, those, of, organic, ligands, in, january, 2021, the, aromaticity, has, been, observed, in, a, large, metal, cluster, anion, consisting, of, 12, bismuth, atoms, stabilised, by, a, center, thorium, cation, this, compound, was, shown, to, be, surprisingly, stable, unlike, many, previous, known, aromatic, metal, clusters, most, of, the, work, on, organothorium, compounds, has, focused, on, the, cyclopentadienyl, complexes, and, cyclooctatetraenyls, like, many, of, the, early, and, middle, actinides, up, to, americium, and, also, expected, for, curium, thorium, forms, a, cyclooctatetraenide, complex, the, yellow, th, c, 8, h, 8, 2, thorocene, it, is, isotypic, with, the, better, known, analogous, uranium, compound, uranocene, it, can, be, prepared, by, reacting, k, 2, c, 8, h, 8, with, thorium, tetrachloride, in, tetrahydrofuran, thf, at, the, temperature, of, dry, ice, or, by, reacting, thorium, tetrafluoride, with, mgc, 8, h, 8, it, is, unstable, in, air, and, decomposes, in, water, or, at, 190, c, half, sandwich, compounds, are, also, known, such, as, 8, c, 8, h, 8, thcl, 2, thf, 2, which, has, a, piano, stool, structure, and, is, made, by, reacting, thorocene, with, thorium, tetrachloride, in, tetrahydrofuran, the, simplest, of, the, cyclopentadienyls, are, th, c, 5, h, 5, 3, and, th, c, 5, h, 5, 4, many, derivatives, are, known, the, former, which, has, two, forms, one, purple, and, one, green, is, a, rare, example, of, thorium, in, the, formal, 3, oxidation, state, a, formal, 2, oxidation, state, occurs, in, a, derivative, the, chloride, derivative, is, prepared, by, heating, thorium, tetrachloride, with, limiting, kc, 5, h, 5, used, other, univalent, metal, cyclopentadienyls, can, also, be, used, the, alkyl, and, aryl, derivatives, are, prepared, from, the, chloride, derivative, and, have, been, used, to, study, the, nature, of, the, th, c, sigma, bond, other, organothorium, compounds, are, not, well, studied, tetrabenzylthorium, th, ch, 2, c, 6, h, 5, 4, and, tetraallylthorium, th, ch, 2, ch, ch, 2, 4, are, known, but, their, structures, have, not, been, determined, they, decompose, slowly, at, room, temperature, thorium, forms, the, monocapped, trigonal, prismatic, anion, 3, heptamethylthorate, iv, which, forms, the, salt, 3, tmeda, ch, 3, 2, nch, 2, ch, 2, n, ch, 3, 2, although, one, methyl, group, is, only, attached, to, the, thorium, atom, th, c, distance, 257, 1, pm, and, the, other, six, connect, the, lithium, and, thorium, atoms, th, c, distances, 265, 5, 276, 5, pm, they, behave, equivalently, in, solution, tetramethylthorium, th, ch, 3, 4, is, not, known, but, its, adducts, are, stabilised, by, phosphine, ligands, 232, th, is, a, primordial, nuclide, having, existed, in, its, current, form, for, over, ten, billion, years, it, was, formed, during, the, r, process, which, probably, occurs, in, supernovae, and, neutron, star, mergers, these, violent, events, scattered, it, across, the, galaxy, the, letter, r, stands, for, rapid, neutron, capture, and, occurs, in, core, collapse, supernovae, where, heavy, seed, nuclei, such, as, 56, fe, rapidly, capture, neutrons, running, up, against, the, neutron, drip, line, as, neutrons, are, captured, much, faster, than, the, resulting, nuclides, can, beta, decay, back, toward, stability, neutron, capture, is, the, only, way, for, stars, to, synthesise, elements, beyond, iron, because, of, the, increased, coulomb, barriers, that, make, interactions, between, charged, particles, difficult, at, high, atomic, numbers, and, the, fact, that, fusion, beyond, 56, fe, is, endothermic, because, of, the, abrupt, loss, of, stability, past, 209, bi, the, r, process, is, the, only, process, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, that, can, create, thorium, and, uranium, all, other, processes, are, too, slow, and, the, intermediate, nuclei, alpha, decay, before, they, capture, enough, neutrons, to, reach, these, elements, in, the, universe, thorium, is, among, the, rarest, of, the, primordial, elements, at, rank, 77th, in, cosmic, abundance, because, it, is, one, of, the, two, elements, that, can, be, produced, only, in, the, r, process, the, other, being, uranium, and, also, because, it, has, slowly, been, decaying, away, from, the, moment, it, formed, the, only, primordial, elements, rarer, than, thorium, are, thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and, rhenium, the, odd, numbered, elements, just, before, the, third, peak, of, r, process, abundances, around, the, heavy, platinum, group, metals, as, well, as, uranium, in, the, distant, past, the, abundances, of, thorium, and, uranium, were, enriched, by, the, decay, of, plutonium, and, curium, isotopes, and, thorium, was, enriched, relative, to, uranium, by, the, decay, of, 236, u, to, 232, th, and, the, natural, depletion, of, 235, u, but, these, sources, have, long, since, decayed, and, no, longer, contribute, in, the, earth, s, crust, thorium, is, much, more, abundant, with, an, abundance, of, 8, 1, g, tonne, it, is, one, of, the, most, abundant, of, the, heavy, elements, almost, as, abundant, as, lead, 13, g, tonne, and, more, abundant, than, tin, 2, 1, g, tonne, this, is, because, thorium, is, likely, to, form, oxide, minerals, that, do, not, sink, into, the, core, it, is, classified, as, a, lithophile, under, the, goldschmidt, classification, meaning, that, it, is, generally, found, combined, with, oxygen, common, thorium, compounds, are, also, poorly, soluble, in, water, thus, even, though, the, refractory, elements, have, the, same, relative, abundances, in, the, earth, as, in, the, solar, system, as, a, whole, there, is, more, accessible, thorium, than, heavy, platinum, group, metals, in, the, crust, natural, thorium, is, usually, almost, pure, 232, th, which, is, the, longest, lived, and, most, stable, isotope, of, thorium, having, a, half, life, comparable, to, the, age, of, the, universe, its, radioactive, decay, is, the, largest, single, contributor, to, the, earth, s, internal, heat, the, other, major, contributors, are, the, shorter, lived, primordial, radionuclides, which, are, 238, u, 40, k, and, 235, u, in, descending, order, of, their, contribution, at, the, time, of, the, earth, s, formation, 40, k, and, 235, u, contributed, much, more, by, virtue, of, their, short, half, lives, but, they, have, decayed, more, quickly, leaving, the, contribution, from, 232, th, and, 238, u, predominant, its, decay, accounts, for, a, gradual, decrease, of, thorium, content, of, the, earth, the, planet, currently, has, around, 85, of, the, amount, present, at, the, formation, of, the, earth, the, other, natural, thorium, isotopes, are, much, shorter, lived, of, them, only, 230, th, is, usually, detectable, occurring, in, secular, equilibrium, with, its, parent, 238, u, and, making, up, at, most, 0, 04, of, natural, thorium, thorium, only, occurs, as, a, minor, constituent, of, most, minerals, and, was, for, this, reason, previously, thought, to, be, rare, in, fact, it, is, the, 37th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, with, an, abundance, of, 12, parts, per, million, in, nature, thorium, occurs, in, the, 4, oxidation, state, together, with, uranium, iv, zirconium, iv, hafnium, iv, and, cerium, iv, and, also, with, scandium, yttrium, and, the, trivalent, lanthanides, which, have, similar, ionic, radii, because, of, thorium, s, radioactivity, minerals, containing, it, are, often, metamict, amorphous, their, crystal, structure, having, been, damaged, by, the, alpha, radiation, produced, by, thorium, an, extreme, example, is, ekanite, ca, fe, pb, 2, th, u, si, 8, o, 20, which, almost, never, occurs, in, nonmetamict, form, due, to, the, thorium, it, contains, monazite, chiefly, phosphates, of, various, rare, earth, elements, is, the, most, important, commercial, source, of, thorium, because, it, occurs, in, large, deposits, worldwide, principally, in, india, south, africa, brazil, australia, and, malaysia, it, contains, around, 2, 5, thorium, on, average, although, some, deposits, may, contain, up, to, 20, monazite, is, a, chemically, unreactive, mineral, that, is, found, as, yellow, or, brown, sand, its, low, reactivity, makes, it, difficult, to, extract, thorium, from, it, allanite, chiefly, silicates, hydroxides, of, various, metals, can, have, 0, 1, 2, thorium, and, zircon, chiefly, zirconium, silicate, zrsio, 4, up, to, 0, 4, thorium, thorium, dioxide, occurs, as, the, rare, mineral, thorianite, due, to, its, being, isotypic, with, uranium, dioxide, these, two, common, actinide, dioxides, can, form, solid, state, solutions, and, the, name, of, the, mineral, changes, according, to, the, tho, 2, content, thorite, chiefly, thorium, silicate, thsio, 4, also, has, a, high, thorium, content, and, is, the, mineral, in, which, thorium, was, first, discovered, in, thorium, silicate, minerals, the, th, 4, and, sio, 4, 4, ions, are, often, replaced, with, m, 3, where, m, sc, y, or, ln, and, phosphate, po, 3, 4, ions, respectively, because, of, the, great, insolubility, of, thorium, dioxide, thorium, does, not, usually, spread, quickly, through, the, environment, when, released, the, th, 4, ion, is, soluble, especially, in, acidic, soils, and, in, such, conditions, the, thorium, concentration, can, be, higher, in, 1815, the, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, analysed, an, unusual, sample, of, gadolinite, from, a, copper, mine, in, falun, central, sweden, he, noted, impregnated, traces, of, a, white, mineral, which, he, cautiously, assumed, to, be, an, earth, oxide, in, modern, chemical, nomenclature, of, an, unknown, element, berzelius, had, already, discovered, two, elements, cerium, and, selenium, but, he, had, made, a, public, mistake, once, announcing, a, new, element, gahnium, that, turned, out, to, be, zinc, oxide, berzelius, privately, named, the, putative, element, thorium, in, 1817, and, its, supposed, oxide, thorina, after, thor, the, norse, god, of, thunder, in, 1824, after, more, deposits, of, the, same, mineral, in, vest, agder, norway, were, discovered, he, retracted, his, findings, as, the, mineral, later, named, xenotime, proved, to, be, mostly, yttrium, orthophosphate, in, 1828, morten, thrane, esmark, found, a, black, mineral, on, l, v, ya, island, telemark, county, norway, he, was, a, norwegian, priest, and, amateur, mineralogist, who, studied, the, minerals, in, telemark, where, he, served, as, vicar, he, commonly, sent, the, most, interesting, specimens, such, as, this, one, to, his, father, jens, esmark, a, noted, mineralogist, and, professor, of, mineralogy, and, geology, at, the, royal, frederick, university, in, christiania, today, called, oslo, the, elder, esmark, determined, that, it, was, not, a, known, mineral, and, sent, a, sample, to, berzelius, for, examination, berzelius, determined, that, it, contained, a, new, element, he, published, his, findings, in, 1829, having, isolated, an, impure, sample, by, reducing, k, potassium, pentafluorothorate, iv, with, potassium, metal, berzelius, reused, the, name, of, the, previous, supposed, element, discovery, and, named, the, source, mineral, thorite, berzelius, made, some, initial, characterizations, of, the, new, metal, and, its, chemical, compounds, he, correctly, determined, that, the, thorium, oxygen, mass, ratio, of, thorium, oxide, was, 7, 5, its, actual, value, is, close, to, that, 7, 3, but, he, assumed, the, new, element, was, divalent, rather, than, tetravalent, and, so, calculated, that, the, atomic, mass, was, 7, 5, times, that, of, oxygen, 120, amu, it, is, actually, 15, times, as, large, he, determined, that, thorium, was, a, very, electropositive, metal, ahead, of, cerium, and, behind, zirconium, in, electropositivity, metallic, thorium, was, isolated, for, the, first, time, in, 1914, by, dutch, entrepreneurs, dirk, lely, jr, and, lodewijk, hamburger, in, the, periodic, table, published, by, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1869, thorium, and, the, rare, earth, elements, were, placed, outside, the, main, body, of, the, table, at, the, end, of, each, vertical, period, after, the, alkaline, earth, metals, this, reflected, the, belief, at, that, time, that, thorium, and, the, rare, earth, metals, were, divalent, with, the, later, recognition, that, the, rare, earths, were, mostly, trivalent, and, thorium, was, tetravalent, mendeleev, moved, cerium, and, thorium, to, group, iv, in, 1871, which, also, contained, the, modern, carbon, group, group, 14, and, titanium, group, group, 4, because, their, maximum, oxidation, state, was, 4, cerium, was, soon, removed, from, the, main, body, of, the, table, and, placed, in, a, separate, lanthanide, series, thorium, was, left, with, group, 4, as, it, had, similar, properties, to, its, supposed, lighter, congeners, in, that, group, such, as, titanium, and, zirconium, while, thorium, was, discovered, in, 1828, its, first, application, dates, only, from, 1885, when, austrian, chemist, carl, auer, von, welsbach, invented, the, gas, mantle, a, portable, source, of, light, which, produces, light, from, the, incandescence, of, thorium, oxide, when, heated, by, burning, gaseous, fuels, many, applications, were, subsequently, found, for, thorium, and, its, compounds, including, ceramics, carbon, arc, lamps, heat, resistant, crucibles, and, as, catalysts, for, industrial, chemical, reactions, such, as, the, oxidation, of, ammonia, to, nitric, acid, thorium, was, first, observed, to, be, radioactive, in, 1898, by, the, german, chemist, gerhard, carl, schmidt, and, later, that, year, independently, by, the, polish, french, physicist, marie, curie, it, was, the, second, element, that, was, found, to, be, radioactive, after, the, 1896, discovery, of, radioactivity, in, uranium, by, french, physicist, henri, becquerel, starting, from, 1899, the, new, zealand, physicist, ernest, rutherford, and, the, american, electrical, engineer, robert, bowie, owens, studied, the, radiation, from, thorium, initial, observations, showed, that, it, varied, significantly, it, was, determined, that, these, variations, came, from, a, short, lived, gaseous, daughter, of, thorium, which, they, found, to, be, a, new, element, this, element, is, now, named, radon, the, only, one, of, the, rare, radioelements, to, be, discovered, in, nature, as, a, daughter, of, thorium, rather, than, uranium, after, accounting, for, the, contribution, of, radon, rutherford, now, working, with, the, british, physicist, frederick, soddy, showed, how, thorium, decayed, at, a, fixed, rate, over, time, into, a, series, of, other, elements, in, work, dating, from, 1900, to, 1903, this, observation, led, to, the, identification, of, the, half, life, as, one, of, the, outcomes, of, the, alpha, particle, experiments, that, led, to, the, disintegration, theory, of, radioactivity, the, biological, effect, of, radiation, was, discovered, in, 1903, the, newly, discovered, phenomenon, of, radioactivity, excited, scientists, and, the, general, public, alike, in, the, 1920s, thorium, s, radioactivity, was, promoted, as, a, cure, for, rheumatism, diabetes, and, sexual, impotence, in, 1932, most, of, these, uses, were, banned, in, the, united, states, after, a, federal, investigation, into, the, health, effects, of, radioactivity, 10, 000, individuals, in, the, united, states, had, been, injected, with, thorium, during, x, ray, diagnosis, they, were, later, found, to, suffer, health, issues, such, as, leukaemia, and, abnormal, chromosomes, public, interest, in, radioactivity, had, declined, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, up, to, the, late, 19th, century, chemists, unanimously, agreed, that, thorium, and, uranium, were, the, heaviest, members, of, group, 4, and, group, 6, respectively, the, existence, of, the, lanthanides, in, the, sixth, row, was, considered, to, be, a, one, off, fluke, in, 1892, british, chemist, henry, bassett, postulated, a, second, extra, long, periodic, table, row, to, accommodate, known, and, undiscovered, elements, considering, thorium, and, uranium, to, be, analogous, to, the, lanthanides, in, 1913, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, published, a, theoretical, model, of, the, atom, and, its, electron, orbitals, which, soon, gathered, wide, acceptance, the, model, indicated, that, the, seventh, row, of, the, periodic, table, should, also, have, f, shells, filling, before, the, d, shells, that, were, filled, in, the, transition, elements, like, the, sixth, row, with, the, lanthanides, preceding, the, 5d, transition, metals, the, existence, of, a, second, inner, transition, series, in, the, form, of, the, actinides, was, not, accepted, until, similarities, with, the, electron, structures, of, the, lanthanides, had, been, established, bohr, suggested, that, the, filling, of, the, 5f, orbitals, may, be, delayed, to, after, uranium, it, was, only, with, the, discovery, of, the, first, transuranic, elements, which, from, plutonium, onward, have, dominant, 3, and, 4, oxidation, states, like, the, lanthanides, that, it, was, realised, that, the, actinides, were, indeed, filling, f, orbitals, rather, than, d, orbitals, with, the, transition, metal, like, chemistry, of, the, early, actinides, being, the, exception, and, not, the, rule, in, 1945, when, american, physicist, glenn, t, seaborg, and, his, team, had, discovered, the, transuranic, elements, americium, and, curium, he, proposed, the, actinide, concept, realising, that, thorium, was, the, second, member, of, an, f, block, actinide, series, analogous, to, the, lanthanides, instead, of, being, the, heavier, congener, of, hafnium, in, a, fourth, d, block, row, in, the, 1990s, most, applications, that, do, not, depend, on, thorium, s, radioactivity, declined, quickly, due, to, safety, and, environmental, concerns, as, suitable, safer, replacements, were, found, despite, its, radioactivity, the, element, has, remained, in, use, for, applications, where, no, suitable, alternatives, could, be, found, a, 1981, study, by, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, the, united, states, estimated, that, using, a, thorium, gas, mantle, every, weekend, would, be, safe, for, a, person, but, this, was, not, the, case, for, the, dose, received, by, people, manufacturing, the, mantles, or, for, the, soils, around, some, factory, sites, some, manufacturers, have, changed, to, other, materials, such, as, yttrium, as, recently, as, 2007, some, companies, continued, to, manufacture, and, sell, thorium, mantles, without, giving, adequate, information, about, their, radioactivity, with, some, even, falsely, claiming, them, to, be, non, radioactive, thorium, has, been, used, as, a, power, source, on, a, prototype, scale, the, earliest, thorium, based, reactor, was, built, at, the, indian, point, energy, center, located, in, buchanan, new, york, united, states, in, 1962, china, may, be, the, first, to, have, a, shot, at, commercializing, the, technology, the, country, with, the, largest, estimated, reserves, of, thorium, in, the, world, is, india, which, has, sparse, reserves, of, uranium, in, the, 1950s, india, targeted, achieving, energy, independence, with, their, three, stage, nuclear, power, programme, in, most, countries, uranium, was, relatively, abundant, and, the, progress, of, thorium, based, reactors, was, slow, in, the, 20th, century, three, reactors, were, built, in, india, and, twelve, elsewhere, large, scale, research, was, begun, in, 1996, by, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, to, study, the, use, of, thorium, reactors, a, year, later, the, united, states, department, of, energy, started, their, research, alvin, radkowsky, of, tel, aviv, university, in, israel, was, the, head, designer, of, shippingport, atomic, power, station, in, pennsylvania, the, first, american, civilian, reactor, to, breed, thorium, he, founded, a, consortium, to, develop, thorium, reactors, which, included, other, laboratories, raytheon, nuclear, inc, and, brookhaven, national, laboratory, in, the, united, states, and, the, kurchatov, institute, in, russia, in, the, 21st, century, thorium, s, potential, for, reducing, nuclear, proliferation, and, its, waste, characteristics, led, to, renewed, interest, in, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, india, has, projected, meeting, as, much, as, 30, of, its, electrical, demands, through, thorium, based, nuclear, power, by, 2050, in, february, 2014, bhabha, atomic, research, centre, barc, in, mumbai, india, presented, their, latest, design, for, a, next, generation, nuclear, reactor, that, burns, thorium, as, its, fuel, core, calling, it, the, advanced, heavy, water, reactor, ahwr, in, 2009, the, chairman, of, the, indian, atomic, energy, commission, said, that, india, has, a, long, term, objective, goal, of, becoming, energy, independent, based, on, its, vast, thorium, resources, on, 16, june, 2023, china, s, national, nuclear, safety, administration, issued, a, license, to, the, shanghai, institute, of, applied, physics, sinap, of, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, to, begin, operating, the, tmsr, lf1, 2, mwt, liquid, fuel, thorium, based, molten, salt, experimental, reactor, which, was, completed, in, august, 2021, china, is, believed, to, have, one, of, the, largest, thorium, reserves, in, the, world, the, exact, size, of, those, reserves, has, not, been, publicly, disclosed, but, it, is, estimated, to, be, enough, to, meet, the, country, s, total, energy, needs, for, more, than, 20, 000, years, when, gram, quantities, of, plutonium, were, first, produced, in, the, manhattan, project, it, was, discovered, that, a, minor, isotope, 240, pu, underwent, significant, spontaneous, fission, which, brought, into, question, the, viability, of, a, plutonium, fueled, gun, type, nuclear, weapon, while, the, los, alamos, team, began, work, on, the, implosion, type, weapon, to, circumvent, this, issue, the, chicago, team, discussed, reactor, design, solutions, eugene, wigner, proposed, to, use, the, 240, pu, contaminated, plutonium, to, drive, the, conversion, of, thorium, into, 233, u, in, a, special, converter, reactor, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, 233, u, would, then, be, usable, in, a, gun, type, weapon, though, concerns, about, contamination, from, 232, u, were, voiced, progress, on, the, implosion, weapon, was, sufficient, and, this, converter, was, not, developed, further, but, the, design, had, enormous, influence, on, the, development, of, nuclear, energy, it, was, the, first, detailed, description, of, a, highly, enriched, water, cooled, water, moderated, reactor, similar, to, future, naval, and, commercial, power, reactors, during, the, cold, war, the, united, states, explored, the, possibility, of, using, 232, th, as, a, source, of, 233, u, to, be, used, in, a, nuclear, bomb, they, fired, a, test, bomb, in, 1955, they, concluded, that, a, 233, u, fired, bomb, would, be, a, very, potent, weapon, but, it, bore, few, sustainable, technical, advantages, over, the, contemporary, uranium, plutonium, bombs, especially, since, 233, u, is, difficult, to, produce, in, isotopically, pure, form, thorium, metal, was, used, in, the, radiation, case, of, at, least, one, nuclear, weapon, design, deployed, by, the, united, states, the, w71, the, low, demand, makes, working, mines, for, extraction, of, thorium, alone, not, profitable, and, it, is, almost, always, extracted, with, the, rare, earths, which, themselves, may, be, by, products, of, production, of, other, minerals, the, current, reliance, on, monazite, for, production, is, due, to, thorium, being, largely, produced, as, a, by, product, other, sources, such, as, thorite, contain, more, thorium, and, could, easily, be, used, for, production, if, demand, rose, present, knowledge, of, the, distribution, of, thorium, resources, is, poor, as, low, demand, has, led, to, exploration, efforts, being, relatively, minor, in, 2014, world, production, of, the, monazite, concentrate, from, which, thorium, would, be, extracted, was, 2, 700, tonnes, the, common, production, route, of, thorium, constitutes, concentration, of, thorium, minerals, extraction, of, thorium, from, the, concentrate, purification, of, thorium, and, optionally, conversion, to, compounds, such, as, thorium, dioxide, there, are, two, categories, of, thorium, minerals, for, thorium, extraction, primary, and, secondary, primary, deposits, occur, in, acidic, granitic, magmas, and, pegmatites, they, are, concentrated, but, of, small, size, secondary, deposits, occur, at, the, mouths, of, rivers, in, granitic, mountain, regions, in, these, deposits, thorium, is, enriched, along, with, other, heavy, minerals, initial, concentration, varies, with, the, type, of, deposit, for, the, primary, deposits, the, source, pegmatites, which, are, usually, obtained, by, mining, are, divided, into, small, parts, and, then, undergo, flotation, alkaline, earth, metal, carbonates, may, be, removed, after, reaction, with, hydrogen, chloride, then, follow, thickening, filtration, and, calcination, the, result, is, a, concentrate, with, rare, earth, content, of, up, to, 90, secondary, materials, such, as, coastal, sands, undergo, gravity, separation, magnetic, separation, follows, with, a, series, of, magnets, of, increasing, strength, monazite, obtained, by, this, method, can, be, as, pure, as, 98, industrial, production, in, the, 20th, century, relied, on, treatment, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, in, cast, iron, vessels, followed, by, selective, precipitation, by, dilution, with, water, as, on, the, subsequent, steps, this, method, relied, on, the, specifics, of, the, technique, and, the, concentrate, grain, size, many, alternatives, have, been, proposed, but, only, one, has, proven, effective, economically, alkaline, digestion, with, hot, sodium, hydroxide, solution, this, is, more, expensive, than, the, original, method, but, yields, a, higher, purity, of, thorium, in, particular, it, removes, phosphates, from, the, concentrate, acid, digestion, is, a, two, stage, process, involving, the, use, of, up, to, 93, sulfuric, acid, at, 210, 230, c, first, sulfuric, acid, in, excess, of, 60, of, the, sand, mass, is, added, thickening, the, reaction, mixture, as, products, are, formed, then, fuming, sulfuric, acid, is, added, and, the, mixture, is, kept, at, the, same, temperature, for, another, five, hours, to, reduce, the, volume, of, solution, remaining, after, dilution, the, concentration, of, the, sulfuric, acid, is, selected, based, on, reaction, rate, and, viscosity, which, both, increase, with, concentration, albeit, with, viscosity, retarding, the, reaction, increasing, the, temperature, also, speeds, up, the, reaction, but, temperatures, of, 300, c, and, above, must, be, avoided, because, they, cause, insoluble, thorium, pyrophosphate, to, form, since, dissolution, is, very, exothermic, the, monazite, sand, cannot, be, added, to, the, acid, too, quickly, conversely, at, temperatures, below, 200, c, the, reaction, does, not, go, fast, enough, for, the, process, to, be, practical, to, ensure, that, no, precipitates, form, to, block, the, reactive, monazite, surface, the, mass, of, acid, used, must, be, twice, that, of, the, sand, instead, of, the, 60, that, would, be, expected, from, stoichiometry, the, mixture, is, then, cooled, to, 70, c, and, diluted, with, ten, times, its, volume, of, cold, water, so, that, any, remaining, monazite, sinks, to, the, bottom, while, the, rare, earths, and, thorium, remain, in, solution, thorium, may, then, be, separated, by, precipitating, it, as, the, phosphate, at, ph, 1, 3, since, the, rare, earths, do, not, precipitate, until, ph, 2, alkaline, digestion, is, carried, out, in, 30, 45, sodium, hydroxide, solution, at, about, 140, c, for, about, three, hours, too, high, a, temperature, leads, to, the, formation, of, poorly, soluble, thorium, oxide, and, an, excess, of, uranium, in, the, filtrate, and, too, low, a, concentration, of, alkali, leads, to, a, very, slow, reaction, these, reaction, conditions, are, rather, mild, and, require, monazite, sand, with, a, particle, size, under, 45, m, following, filtration, the, filter, cake, includes, thorium, and, the, rare, earths, as, their, hydroxides, uranium, as, sodium, diuranate, and, phosphate, as, trisodium, phosphate, this, crystallises, trisodium, phosphate, decahydrate, when, cooled, below, 60, c, uranium, impurities, in, this, product, increase, with, the, amount, of, silicon, dioxide, in, the, reaction, mixture, necessitating, recrystallisation, before, commercial, use, the, hydroxides, are, dissolved, at, 80, c, in, 37, hydrochloric, acid, filtration, of, the, remaining, precipitates, followed, by, addition, of, 47, sodium, hydroxide, results, in, the, precipitation, of, thorium, and, uranium, at, about, ph, 5, 8, complete, drying, of, the, precipitate, must, be, avoided, as, air, may, oxidise, cerium, from, the, 3, to, the, 4, oxidation, state, and, the, cerium, iv, formed, can, liberate, free, chlorine, from, the, hydrochloric, acid, the, rare, earths, again, precipitate, out, at, higher, ph, the, precipitates, are, neutralised, by, the, original, sodium, hydroxide, solution, although, most, of, the, phosphate, must, first, be, removed, to, avoid, precipitating, rare, earth, phosphates, solvent, extraction, may, also, be, used, to, separate, out, the, thorium, and, uranium, by, dissolving, the, resultant, filter, cake, in, nitric, acid, the, presence, of, titanium, hydroxide, is, deleterious, as, it, binds, thorium, and, prevents, it, from, dissolving, fully, high, thorium, concentrations, are, needed, in, nuclear, applications, in, particular, concentrations, of, atoms, with, high, neutron, capture, cross, sections, must, be, very, low, for, example, gadolinium, concentrations, must, be, lower, than, one, part, per, million, by, weight, previously, repeated, dissolution, and, recrystallisation, was, used, to, achieve, high, purity, today, liquid, solvent, extraction, procedures, involving, selective, complexation, of, th, 4, are, used, for, example, following, alkaline, digestion, and, the, removal, of, phosphate, the, resulting, nitrato, complexes, of, thorium, uranium, and, the, rare, earths, can, be, separated, by, extraction, with, tributyl, phosphate, in, kerosene, non, radioactivity, related, uses, of, thorium, have, been, in, decline, since, the, 1950s, due, to, environmental, concerns, largely, stemming, from, the, radioactivity, of, thorium, and, its, decay, products, most, thorium, applications, use, its, dioxide, sometimes, called, thoria, in, the, industry, rather, than, the, metal, this, compound, has, a, melting, point, of, 3300, c, 6000, f, the, highest, of, all, known, oxides, only, a, few, substances, have, higher, melting, points, this, helps, the, compound, remain, solid, in, a, flame, and, it, considerably, increases, the, brightness, of, the, flame, this, is, the, main, reason, thorium, is, used, in, gas, lamp, mantles, all, substances, emit, energy, glow, at, high, temperatures, but, the, light, emitted, by, thorium, is, nearly, all, in, the, visible, spectrum, hence, the, brightness, of, thorium, mantles, energy, some, of, it, in, the, form, of, visible, light, is, emitted, when, thorium, is, exposed, to, a, source, of, energy, itself, such, as, a, cathode, ray, heat, or, ultraviolet, light, this, effect, is, shared, by, cerium, dioxide, which, converts, ultraviolet, light, into, visible, light, more, efficiently, but, thorium, dioxide, gives, a, higher, flame, temperature, emitting, less, infrared, light, thorium, in, mantles, though, still, common, has, been, progressively, replaced, with, yttrium, since, the, late, 1990s, according, to, the, 2005, review, by, the, united, kingdom, s, national, radiological, protection, board, although, were, widely, available, a, few, years, ago, they, are, not, any, more, thorium, is, also, used, to, make, cheap, permanent, negative, ion, generators, such, as, in, pseudoscientific, health, bracelets, during, the, production, of, incandescent, filaments, recrystallisation, of, tungsten, is, significantly, lowered, by, adding, small, amounts, of, thorium, dioxide, to, the, tungsten, sintering, powder, before, drawing, the, filaments, a, small, addition, of, thorium, to, tungsten, thermocathodes, considerably, reduces, the, work, function, of, electrons, as, a, result, electrons, are, emitted, at, considerably, lower, temperatures, thorium, forms, a, one, atom, thick, layer, on, the, surface, of, tungsten, the, work, function, from, a, thorium, surface, is, lowered, possibly, because, of, the, electric, field, on, the, interface, between, thorium, and, tungsten, formed, due, to, thorium, s, greater, electropositivity, since, the, 1920s, thoriated, tungsten, wires, have, been, used, in, electronic, tubes, and, in, the, cathodes, and, anticathodes, of, x, ray, tubes, and, rectifiers, the, reactivity, of, thorium, with, atmospheric, oxygen, required, the, introduction, of, an, evaporated, magnesium, layer, as, a, getter, for, impurities, in, the, evacuated, tubes, giving, them, their, characteristic, metallic, inner, coating, 16, the, introduction, of, transistors, in, the, 1950s, significantly, diminished, this, use, but, not, entirely, thorium, dioxide, is, used, in, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, gtaw, to, increase, the, high, temperature, strength, of, tungsten, electrodes, and, improve, arc, stability, thorium, oxide, is, being, replaced, in, this, use, with, other, oxides, such, as, those, of, zirconium, cerium, and, lanthanum, thorium, dioxide, is, found, in, refractory, ceramics, such, as, high, temperature, laboratory, crucibles, either, as, the, primary, ingredient, or, as, an, addition, to, zirconium, dioxide, an, alloy, of, 90, platinum, and, 10, thorium, is, an, effective, catalyst, for, oxidising, ammonia, to, nitrogen, oxides, but, this, has, been, replaced, by, an, alloy, of, 95, platinum, and, 5, rhodium, because, of, its, better, mechanical, properties, and, greater, durability, when, added, to, glass, thorium, dioxide, helps, increase, its, refractive, index, and, decrease, dispersion, such, glass, finds, application, in, high, quality, lenses, for, cameras, and, scientific, instruments, the, radiation, from, these, lenses, can, darken, them, and, turn, them, yellow, over, a, period, of, years, and, it, degrades, film, but, the, health, risks, are, minimal, yellowed, lenses, may, be, restored, to, their, original, colourless, state, by, lengthy, exposure, to, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, thorium, dioxide, has, since, been, replaced, in, this, application, by, rare, earth, oxides, such, as, lanthanum, as, they, provide, similar, effects, and, are, not, radioactive, thorium, tetrafluoride, is, used, as, an, anti, reflection, material, in, multilayered, optical, coatings, it, is, transparent, to, electromagnetic, waves, having, wavelengths, in, the, range, of, 0, 350, 12, m, a, range, that, includes, near, ultraviolet, visible, and, mid, infrared, light, its, radiation, is, primarily, due, to, alpha, particles, which, can, be, easily, stopped, by, a, thin, cover, layer, of, another, material, replacements, for, thorium, tetrafluoride, are, being, developed, as, of, the, 2010s, which, include, lanthanum, trifluoride, mag, thor, alloys, also, called, thoriated, magnesium, found, use, in, some, aerospace, applications, though, such, uses, have, been, phased, out, due, to, concerns, over, radioactivity, the, main, nuclear, power, source, in, a, reactor, is, the, neutron, induced, fission, of, a, nuclide, the, synthetic, fissile, nuclei, 233, u, and, 239, pu, can, be, bred, from, neutron, capture, by, the, naturally, occurring, quantity, nuclides, 232, th, and, 238, u, 235, u, occurs, naturally, in, significant, amounts, and, is, also, fissile, in, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, the, fertile, isotope, 232, th, is, bombarded, by, slow, neutrons, undergoing, neutron, capture, to, become, 233, th, which, undergoes, two, consecutive, beta, decays, to, become, first, 233, pa, and, then, the, fissile, 233, u, 233, u, is, fissile, and, can, be, used, as, a, nuclear, fuel, in, the, same, way, as, 235, u, or, 239, pu, when, 233, u, undergoes, nuclear, fission, the, neutrons, emitted, can, strike, further, 232, th, nuclei, continuing, the, cycle, this, parallels, the, uranium, fuel, cycle, in, fast, breeder, reactors, where, 238, u, undergoes, neutron, capture, to, become, 239, u, beta, decaying, to, first, 239, np, and, then, fissile, 239, pu, the, fission, of, 233, 92, u, produces, 2, 48, neutrons, on, average, one, neutron, is, needed, to, keep, the, fission, reaction, going, for, a, self, contained, continuous, breeding, cycle, one, more, neutron, is, needed, to, breed, a, new, 233, 92, u, atom, from, the, fertile, 232, 90, th, this, leaves, a, margin, of, 0, 45, neutrons, or, 18, of, the, neutron, flux, for, losses, thorium, is, more, abundant, than, uranium, and, can, satisfy, world, energy, demands, for, longer, it, is, particularly, suitable, for, being, used, as, fertile, material, in, molten, salt, reactors, 232, th, absorbs, neutrons, more, readily, than, 238, u, and, 233, u, has, a, higher, probability, of, fission, upon, neutron, capture, 92, 0, than, 235, u, 85, 5, or, 239, pu, 73, 5, it, also, releases, more, neutrons, upon, fission, on, average, a, single, neutron, capture, by, 238, u, produces, transuranic, waste, along, with, the, fissile, 239, pu, but, 232, th, only, produces, this, waste, after, five, captures, forming, 237, np, this, number, of, captures, does, not, happen, for, 98, 99, of, the, 232, th, nuclei, because, the, intermediate, products, 233, u, or, 235, u, undergo, fission, and, fewer, long, lived, transuranics, are, produced, because, of, this, thorium, is, a, potentially, attractive, alternative, to, uranium, in, mixed, oxide, fuels, to, minimise, the, generation, of, transuranics, and, maximise, the, destruction, of, plutonium, thorium, fuels, result, in, a, safer, and, better, performing, reactor, core, because, thorium, dioxide, has, a, higher, melting, point, higher, thermal, conductivity, and, a, lower, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, it, is, more, stable, chemically, than, the, now, common, fuel, uranium, dioxide, because, the, latter, oxidises, to, triuranium, octoxide, u, 3, o, 8, becoming, substantially, less, dense, the, used, fuel, is, difficult, and, dangerous, to, reprocess, because, many, of, the, daughters, of, 232, th, and, 233, u, are, strong, gamma, emitters, all, 233, u, production, methods, result, in, impurities, of, 232, u, either, from, parasitic, knock, out, n, 2n, reactions, on, 232, th, 233, pa, or, 233, u, that, result, in, the, loss, of, a, neutron, or, from, double, neutron, capture, of, 230, th, an, impurity, in, natural, 232, th, 232, u, by, itself, is, not, particularly, harmful, but, quickly, decays, to, produce, the, strong, gamma, emitter, 208, tl, 232, th, follows, the, same, decay, chain, but, its, much, longer, half, life, means, that, the, quantities, of, 208, tl, produced, are, negligible, these, impurities, of, 232, u, make, 233, u, easy, to, detect, and, dangerous, to, work, on, and, the, impracticality, of, their, separation, limits, the, possibilities, of, nuclear, proliferation, using, 233, u, as, the, fissile, material, 233, pa, has, a, relatively, long, half, life, of, 27, days, and, a, high, cross, section, for, neutron, capture, thus, it, is, a, neutron, poison, instead, of, rapidly, decaying, to, the, useful, 233, u, a, significant, amount, of, 233, pa, converts, to, 234, u, and, consumes, neutrons, degrading, the, reactor, efficiency, to, avoid, this, 233, pa, is, extracted, from, the, active, zone, of, thorium, molten, salt, reactors, during, their, operation, so, that, it, does, not, have, a, chance, to, capture, a, neutron, and, will, only, decay, to, 233, u, the, irradiation, of, 232, th, with, neutrons, followed, by, its, processing, need, to, be, mastered, before, these, advantages, can, be, realised, and, this, requires, more, advanced, technology, than, the, uranium, and, plutonium, fuel, cycle, research, continues, in, this, area, others, cite, the, low, commercial, viability, of, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, the, international, nuclear, energy, agency, predicts, that, the, thorium, cycle, will, never, be, commercially, viable, while, uranium, is, available, in, abundance, a, situation, which, may, persist, in, the, coming, decades, the, isotopes, produced, in, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, are, mostly, not, transuranic, but, some, of, them, are, still, very, dangerous, such, as, 231, pa, which, has, a, half, life, of, 32, 760, years, and, is, a, major, contributor, to, the, long, term, radiotoxicity, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, natural, thorium, decays, very, slowly, compared, to, many, other, radioactive, materials, and, the, emitted, alpha, radiation, cannot, penetrate, human, skin, as, a, result, handling, small, amounts, of, thorium, such, as, those, in, gas, mantles, is, considered, safe, although, the, use, of, such, items, may, pose, some, risks, exposure, to, an, aerosol, of, thorium, such, as, contaminated, dust, can, lead, to, increased, risk, of, cancers, of, the, lung, pancreas, and, blood, as, lungs, and, other, internal, organs, can, be, penetrated, by, alpha, radiation, internal, exposure, to, thorium, leads, to, increased, risk, of, liver, diseases, the, decay, products, of, 232, th, include, more, dangerous, radionuclides, such, as, radium, and, radon, although, relatively, little, of, those, products, are, created, as, the, result, of, the, slow, decay, of, thorium, a, proper, assessment, of, the, radiological, toxicity, of, 232, th, must, include, the, contribution, of, its, daughters, some, of, which, are, dangerous, gamma, emitters, and, which, are, built, up, quickly, following, the, initial, decay, of, 232, th, due, to, the, absence, of, long, lived, nuclides, along, the, decay, chain, as, the, dangerous, daughters, of, thorium, have, much, lower, melting, points, than, thorium, dioxide, they, are, volatilised, every, time, the, mantle, is, heated, for, use, in, the, first, hour, of, use, large, fractions, of, the, thorium, daughters, 224, ra, 228, ra, 212, pb, and, 212, bi, are, released, most, of, the, radiation, dose, by, a, normal, user, arises, from, inhaling, the, radium, resulting, in, a, radiation, dose, of, up, to, 0, 2, millisieverts, per, use, about, a, third, of, the, dose, sustained, during, a, mammogram, some, nuclear, safety, agencies, make, recommendations, about, the, use, of, thorium, mantles, and, have, raised, safety, concerns, regarding, their, manufacture, and, disposal, the, radiation, dose, from, one, mantle, is, not, a, serious, problem, but, that, from, many, mantles, gathered, together, in, factories, or, landfills, is, thorium, is, odourless, and, tasteless, the, chemical, toxicity, of, thorium, is, low, because, thorium, and, its, most, common, compounds, mostly, the, dioxide, are, poorly, soluble, in, water, precipitating, out, before, entering, the, body, as, the, hydroxide, some, thorium, compounds, are, chemically, moderately, toxic, especially, in, the, presence, of, strong, complex, forming, ions, such, as, citrate, that, carry, the, thorium, into, the, body, in, soluble, form, if, a, thorium, containing, object, has, been, chewed, or, sucked, it, loses, 0, 4, of, thorium, and, 90, of, its, dangerous, daughters, to, the, body, three, quarters, of, the, thorium, that, has, penetrated, the, body, accumulates, in, the, skeleton, absorption, through, the, skin, is, possible, but, is, not, a, likely, means, of, exposure, thorium, s, low, solubility, in, water, also, means, that, excretion, of, thorium, by, the, kidneys, and, faeces, is, rather, slow, tests, on, the, thorium, uptake, of, workers, involved,

very, small, quantities, everywhere, on, earth, although, larger, amounts, exist, in, certain, parts, the, average, human, contains, about, 40, micrograms, of, thorium, and, typically, consumes, three, micrograms, per, day, most, thorium, exposure, occurs, through, dust, inhalation, some, thorium, comes, with, food, and, water, but, because, of, its, low, solubility, this, exposure, is, negligible, exposure, is, raised, for, people, who, live, near, thorium, deposits, or, radioactive, waste, disposal, sites, those, who, live, near, or, work, in, uranium, phosphate, or, tin, processing, factories, and, for, those, who, work, in, gas, mantle, production, thorium, is, especially, common, in, the, tamil, nadu, coastal, areas, of, india, where, residents, may, be, exposed, to, a, naturally, occurring, radiation, dose, ten, times, higher, than, the, worldwide, average, it, is, also, common, in, northern, brazilian, coastal, areas, from, south, bahia, to, guarapari, a,
