in, physics, a, state, of, matter, is, one, of, the, distinct, forms, in, which, matter, can, exist, four, states, of, matter, are, observable, in, everyday, life, solid, liquid, gas, and, plasma, many, intermediate, states, are, known, to, exist, such, as, liquid, crystal, and, some, states, only, exist, under, extreme, conditions, such, as, bose, einstein, condensates, and, fermionic, condensates, in, extreme, cold, neutron, degenerate, matter, in, extreme, density, and, quark, gluon, plasma, at, extremely, high, energy, historically, the, distinction, is, based, on, qualitative, differences, in, properties, matter, in, the, solid, state, maintains, a, fixed, volume, assuming, no, change, in, temperature, or, air, pressure, and, shape, with, component, particles, atoms, molecules, or, ions, close, together, and, fixed, into, place, matter, in, the, liquid, state, maintains, a, fixed, volume, assuming, no, change, in, temperature, or, air, pressure, but, has, a, variable, shape, that, adapts, to, fit, its, container, its, particles, are, still, close, together, but, move, freely, matter, in, the, gaseous, state, has, both, variable, volume, and, shape, adapting, both, to, fit, its, container, its, particles, are, neither, close, together, nor, fixed, in, place, matter, in, the, plasma, state, has, variable, volume, and, shape, and, contains, neutral, atoms, as, well, as, a, significant, number, of, ions, and, electrons, both, of, which, can, move, around, freely, the, term, phase, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, state, of, matter, but, it, is, possible, for, a, single, compound, to, form, different, phases, that, are, in, the, same, state, of, matter, for, example, ice, is, the, solid, state, of, water, but, there, are, multiple, phases, of, ice, with, different, crystal, structures, which, are, formed, at, different, pressures, and, temperatures, in, a, solid, constituent, particles, ions, atoms, or, molecules, are, closely, packed, together, the, forces, between, particles, are, so, strong, that, the, particles, cannot, move, freely, but, can, only, vibrate, as, a, result, a, solid, has, a, stable, definite, shape, and, a, definite, volume, solids, can, only, change, their, shape, by, an, outside, force, as, when, broken, or, cut, in, crystalline, solids, the, particles, atoms, molecules, or, ions, are, packed, in, a, regularly, ordered, repeating, pattern, there, are, various, different, crystal, structures, and, the, same, substance, can, have, more, than, one, structure, or, solid, phase, for, example, iron, has, a, body, centred, cubic, structure, at, temperatures, below, 912, c, 1, 674, f, and, a, face, centred, cubic, structure, between, 912, and, 1, 394, c, 2, 541, f, ice, has, fifteen, known, crystal, structures, or, fifteen, solid, phases, which, exist, at, various, temperatures, and, pressures, glasses, and, other, non, crystalline, amorphous, solids, without, long, range, order, are, not, thermal, equilibrium, ground, states, therefore, they, are, described, below, as, nonclassical, states, of, matter, solids, can, be, transformed, into, liquids, by, melting, and, liquids, can, be, transformed, into, solids, by, freezing, solids, can, also, change, directly, into, gases, through, the, process, of, sublimation, and, gases, can, likewise, change, directly, into, solids, through, deposition, a, liquid, is, a, nearly, incompressible, fluid, that, conforms, to, the, shape, of, its, container, but, retains, a, nearly, constant, volume, independent, of, pressure, the, volume, is, definite, if, the, temperature, and, pressure, are, constant, when, a, solid, is, heated, above, its, melting, point, it, becomes, liquid, given, that, the, pressure, is, higher, than, the, triple, point, of, the, substance, intermolecular, or, interatomic, or, interionic, forces, are, still, important, but, the, molecules, have, enough, energy, to, move, relative, to, each, other, and, the, structure, is, mobile, this, means, that, the, shape, of, a, liquid, is, not, definite, but, is, determined, by, its, container, the, volume, is, usually, greater, than, that, of, the, corresponding, solid, the, best, known, exception, being, water, h, 2, o, the, highest, temperature, at, which, a, given, liquid, can, exist, is, its, critical, temperature, a, gas, is, a, compressible, fluid, not, only, will, a, gas, conform, to, the, shape, of, its, container, but, it, will, also, expand, to, fill, the, container, in, a, gas, the, molecules, have, enough, kinetic, energy, so, that, the, effect, of, intermolecular, forces, is, small, or, zero, for, an, ideal, gas, and, the, typical, distance, between, neighboring, molecules, is, much, greater, than, the, molecular, size, a, gas, has, no, definite, shape, or, volume, but, occupies, the, entire, container, in, which, it, is, confined, a, liquid, may, be, converted, to, a, gas, by, heating, at, constant, pressure, to, the, boiling, point, or, else, by, reducing, the, pressure, at, constant, temperature, at, temperatures, below, its, critical, temperature, a, gas, is, also, called, a, vapor, and, can, be, liquefied, by, compression, alone, without, cooling, a, vapor, can, exist, in, equilibrium, with, a, liquid, or, solid, in, which, case, the, gas, pressure, equals, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, liquid, or, solid, a, supercritical, fluid, scf, is, a, gas, whose, temperature, and, pressure, are, above, the, critical, temperature, and, critical, pressure, respectively, in, this, state, the, distinction, between, liquid, and, gas, disappears, a, supercritical, fluid, has, the, physical, properties, of, a, gas, but, its, high, density, confers, solvent, properties, in, some, cases, which, leads, to, useful, applications, for, example, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, is, used, to, extract, caffeine, in, the, manufacture, of, decaffeinated, coffee, a, gas, is, usually, converted, to, a, plasma, in, one, of, two, ways, either, from, a, huge, voltage, difference, between, two, points, or, by, exposing, it, to, extremely, high, temperatures, heating, matter, to, high, temperatures, causes, electrons, to, leave, the, atoms, resulting, in, the, presence, of, free, electrons, this, creates, a, so, called, partially, ionised, plasma, at, very, high, temperatures, such, as, those, present, in, stars, it, is, assumed, that, essentially, all, electrons, are, free, and, that, a, very, high, energy, plasma, is, essentially, bare, nuclei, swimming, in, a, sea, of, electrons, this, forms, the, so, called, fully, ionised, plasma, the, plasma, state, is, often, misunderstood, and, although, not, freely, existing, under, normal, conditions, on, earth, it, is, quite, commonly, generated, by, either, lightning, electric, sparks, fluorescent, lights, neon, lights, or, in, plasma, televisions, the, sun, s, corona, some, types, of, flame, and, stars, are, all, examples, of, illuminated, matter, in, the, plasma, state, plasma, is, by, far, the, most, abundant, of, the, four, fundamental, states, as, 99, of, all, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, is, plasma, as, it, composes, all, stars, a, state, of, matter, is, also, characterized, by, phase, transitions, a, phase, transition, indicates, a, change, in, structure, and, can, be, recognized, by, an, abrupt, change, in, properties, a, distinct, state, of, matter, can, be, defined, as, any, set, of, states, distinguished, from, any, other, set, of, states, by, a, phase, transition, water, can, be, said, to, have, several, distinct, solid, states, the, appearance, of, superconductivity, is, associated, with, a, phase, transition, so, there, are, superconductive, states, likewise, ferromagnetic, states, are, demarcated, by, phase, transitions, and, have, distinctive, properties, when, the, change, of, state, occurs, in, stages, the, intermediate, steps, are, called, mesophases, such, phases, have, been, exploited, by, the, introduction, of, liquid, crystal, technology, the, state, or, phase, of, a, given, set, of, matter, can, change, depending, on, pressure, and, temperature, conditions, transitioning, to, other, phases, as, these, conditions, change, to, favor, their, existence, for, example, solid, transitions, to, liquid, with, an, increase, in, temperature, near, absolute, zero, a, substance, exists, as, a, solid, as, heat, is, added, to, this, substance, it, melts, into, a, liquid, at, its, melting, point, boils, into, a, gas, at, its, boiling, point, and, if, heated, high, enough, would, enter, a, plasma, state, in, which, the, electrons, are, so, energized, that, they, leave, their, parent, atoms, forms, of, matter, that, are, not, composed, of, molecules, and, are, organized, by, different, forces, can, also, be, considered, different, states, of, matter, superfluids, like, fermionic, condensate, and, the, quark, gluon, plasma, are, examples, in, a, chemical, equation, the, state, of, matter, of, the, chemicals, may, be, shown, as, s, for, solid, l, for, liquid, and, g, for, gas, an, aqueous, solution, is, denoted, aq, for, example, matter, in, the, plasma, state, is, seldom, used, if, at, all, in, chemical, equations, so, there, is, no, standard, symbol, to, denote, it, in, the, rare, equations, that, plasma, is, used, it, is, symbolized, as, p, glass, is, a, non, crystalline, or, amorphous, solid, material, that, exhibits, a, glass, transition, when, heated, towards, the, liquid, state, glasses, can, be, made, of, quite, different, classes, of, materials, inorganic, networks, such, as, window, glass, made, of, silicate, plus, additives, metallic, alloys, ionic, melts, aqueous, solutions, molecular, liquids, and, polymers, thermodynamically, a, glass, is, in, a, metastable, state, with, respect, to, its, crystalline, counterpart, the, conversion, rate, however, is, practically, zero, a, plastic, crystal, is, a, molecular, solid, with, long, range, positional, order, but, with, constituent, molecules, retaining, rotational, freedom, in, an, orientational, glass, this, degree, of, freedom, is, frozen, in, a, quenched, disordered, state, similarly, in, a, spin, glass, magnetic, disorder, is, frozen, liquid, crystal, states, have, properties, intermediate, between, mobile, liquids, and, ordered, solids, generally, they, are, able, to, flow, like, a, liquid, but, exhibiting, long, range, order, for, example, the, nematic, phase, consists, of, long, rod, like, molecules, such, as, para, azoxyanisole, which, is, nematic, in, the, temperature, range, 118, 136, c, 244, 277, f, in, this, state, the, molecules, flow, as, in, a, liquid, but, they, all, point, in, the, same, direction, within, each, domain, and, cannot, rotate, freely, like, a, crystalline, solid, but, unlike, a, liquid, liquid, crystals, react, to, polarized, light, other, types, of, liquid, crystals, are, described, in, the, main, article, on, these, states, several, types, have, technological, importance, for, example, in, liquid, crystal, displays, copolymers, can, undergo, microphase, separation, to, form, a, diverse, array, of, periodic, nanostructures, as, shown, in, the, example, of, the, styrene, butadiene, styrene, block, copolymer, shown, at, right, microphase, separation, can, be, understood, by, analogy, to, the, phase, separation, between, oil, and, water, due, to, chemical, incompatibility, between, the, blocks, block, copolymers, undergo, a, similar, phase, separation, however, because, the, blocks, are, covalently, bonded, to, each, other, they, cannot, demix, macroscopically, as, water, and, oil, can, and, so, instead, the, blocks, form, nanometre, sized, structures, depending, on, the, relative, lengths, of, each, block, and, the, overall, block, topology, of, the, polymer, many, morphologies, can, be, obtained, each, its, own, phase, of, matter, ionic, liquids, also, display, microphase, separation, the, anion, and, cation, are, not, necessarily, compatible, and, would, demix, otherwise, but, electric, charge, attraction, prevents, them, from, separating, their, anions, and, cations, appear, to, diffuse, within, compartmentalized, layers, or, micelles, instead, of, freely, as, in, a, uniform, liquid, transition, metal, atoms, often, have, magnetic, moments, due, to, the, net, spin, of, electrons, that, remain, unpaired, and, do, not, form, chemical, bonds, in, some, solids, the, magnetic, moments, on, different, atoms, are, ordered, and, can, form, a, ferromagnet, an, antiferromagnet, or, a, ferrimagnet, in, a, ferromagnet, for, instance, solid, iron, the, magnetic, moment, on, each, atom, is, aligned, in, the, same, direction, within, a, magnetic, domain, if, the, domains, are, also, aligned, the, solid, is, a, permanent, magnet, which, is, magnetic, even, in, the, absence, of, an, external, magnetic, field, the, magnetization, disappears, when, the, magnet, is, heated, to, the, curie, point, which, for, iron, is, 768, c, 1, 414, f, an, antiferromagnet, has, two, networks, of, equal, and, opposite, magnetic, moments, which, cancel, each, other, out, so, that, the, net, magnetization, is, zero, for, example, in, nickel, ii, oxide, nio, half, the, nickel, atoms, have, moments, aligned, in, one, direction, and, half, in, the, opposite, direction, in, a, ferrimagnet, the, two, networks, of, magnetic, moments, are, opposite, but, unequal, so, that, cancellation, is, incomplete, and, there, is, a, non, zero, net, magnetization, an, example, is, magnetite, fe, 3, o, 4, which, contains, fe, 2, and, fe, 3, ions, with, different, magnetic, moments, a, quantum, spin, liquid, qsl, is, a, disordered, state, in, a, system, of, interacting, quantum, spins, which, preserves, its, disorder, to, very, low, temperatures, unlike, other, disordered, states, it, is, not, a, liquid, in, physical, sense, but, a, solid, whose, magnetic, order, is, inherently, disordered, the, name, liquid, is, due, to, an, analogy, with, the, molecular, disorder, in, a, conventional, liquid, a, qsl, is, neither, a, ferromagnet, where, magnetic, domains, are, parallel, nor, an, antiferromagnet, where, the, magnetic, domains, are, antiparallel, instead, the, magnetic, domains, are, randomly, oriented, this, can, be, realized, e, g, by, geometrically, frustrated, magnetic, moments, that, cannot, point, uniformly, parallel, or, antiparallel, when, cooling, down, and, settling, to, a, state, the, domain, must, choose, an, orientation, but, if, the, possible, states, are, similar, in, energy, one, will, be, chosen, randomly, consequently, despite, strong, short, range, order, there, is, no, long, range, magnetic, order, superconductors, are, materials, which, have, zero, electrical, resistivity, and, therefore, perfect, conductivity, this, is, a, distinct, physical, state, which, exists, at, low, temperature, and, the, resistivity, increases, discontinuously, to, a, finite, value, at, a, sharply, defined, transition, temperature, for, each, superconductor, a, superconductor, also, excludes, all, magnetic, fields, from, its, interior, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, meissner, effect, or, perfect, diamagnetism, superconducting, magnets, are, used, as, electromagnets, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, machines, the, phenomenon, of, superconductivity, was, discovered, in, 1911, and, for, 75, years, was, only, known, in, some, metals, and, metallic, alloys, at, temperatures, below, 30, k, in, 1986, so, called, high, temperature, superconductivity, was, discovered, in, certain, ceramic, oxides, and, has, now, been, observed, in, temperatures, as, high, as, 164, k, close, to, absolute, zero, some, liquids, form, a, second, liquid, state, described, as, superfluid, because, it, has, zero, viscosity, or, infinite, fluidity, i, e, flowing, without, friction, this, was, discovered, in, 1937, for, helium, which, forms, a, superfluid, below, the, lambda, temperature, of, 2, 17, k, 270, 98, c, 455, 76, f, in, this, state, it, will, attempt, to, climb, out, of, its, container, it, also, has, infinite, thermal, conductivity, so, that, no, temperature, gradient, can, form, in, a, superfluid, placing, a, superfluid, in, a, spinning, container, will, result, in, quantized, vortices, these, properties, are, explained, by, the, theory, that, the, common, isotope, helium, 4, forms, a, bose, einstein, condensate, see, next, section, in, the, superfluid, state, more, recently, fermionic, condensate, superfluids, have, been, formed, at, even, lower, temperatures, by, the, rare, isotope, helium, 3, and, by, lithium, 6, in, 1924, albert, einstein, and, satyendra, nath, bose, predicted, the, bose, einstein, condensate, bec, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, fifth, state, of, matter, in, a, bec, matter, stops, behaving, as, independent, particles, and, collapses, into, a, single, quantum, state, that, can, be, described, with, a, single, uniform, wavefunction, in, the, gas, phase, the, bose, einstein, condensate, remained, an, unverified, theoretical, prediction, for, many, years, in, 1995, the, research, groups, of, eric, cornell, and, carl, wieman, of, jila, at, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, produced, the, first, such, condensate, experimentally, a, bose, einstein, condensate, is, colder, than, a, solid, it, may, occur, when, atoms, have, very, similar, or, the, same, quantum, levels, at, temperatures, very, close, to, absolute, zero, 273, 15, c, 459, 67, f, a, fermionic, condensate, is, similar, to, the, bose, einstein, condensate, but, composed, of, fermions, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, prevents, fermions, from, entering, the, same, quantum, state, but, a, pair, of, fermions, can, behave, as, a, boson, and, multiple, such, pairs, can, then, enter, the, same, quantum, state, without, restriction, under, extremely, high, pressure, as, in, the, cores, of, dead, stars, ordinary, matter, undergoes, a, transition, to, a, series, of, exotic, states, of, matter, collectively, known, as, degenerate, matter, which, are, supported, mainly, by, quantum, mechanical, effects, in, physics, degenerate, refers, to, two, states, that, have, the, same, energy, and, are, thus, interchangeable, degenerate, matter, is, supported, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, prevents, two, fermionic, particles, from, occupying, the, same, quantum, state, unlike, regular, plasma, degenerate, plasma, expands, little, when, heated, because, there, are, simply, no, momentum, states, left, consequently, degenerate, stars, collapse, into, very, high, densities, more, massive, degenerate, stars, are, smaller, because, the, gravitational, force, increases, but, pressure, does, not, increase, proportionally, electron, degenerate, matter, is, found, inside, white, dwarf, stars, electrons, remain, bound, to, atoms, but, are, able, to, transfer, to, adjacent, atoms, neutron, degenerate, matter, is, found, in, neutron, stars, vast, gravitational, pressure, compresses, atoms, so, strongly, that, the, electrons, are, forced, to, combine, with, protons, via, inverse, beta, decay, resulting, in, a, superdense, conglomeration, of, neutrons, normally, free, neutrons, outside, an, atomic, nucleus, will, decay, with, a, half, life, of, approximately, 10, minutes, but, in, a, neutron, star, the, decay, is, overtaken, by, inverse, decay, cold, degenerate, matter, is, also, present, in, planets, such, as, jupiter, and, in, the, even, more, massive, brown, dwarfs, which, are, expected, to, have, a, core, with, metallic, hydrogen, because, of, the, degeneracy, more, massive, brown, dwarfs, are, not, significantly, larger, in, metals, the, electrons, can, be, modeled, as, a, degenerate, gas, moving, in, a, lattice, of, non, degenerate, positive, ions, in, regular, cold, matter, quarks, fundamental, particles, of, nuclear, matter, are, confined, by, the, strong, force, into, hadrons, that, consist, of, 2, 4, quarks, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, quark, matter, or, quantum, chromodynamical, qcd, matter, is, a, group, of, phases, where, the, strong, force, is, overcome, and, quarks, are, deconfined, and, free, to, move, quark, matter, phases, occur, at, extremely, high, densities, or, temperatures, and, there, are, no, known, ways, to, produce, them, in, equilibrium, in, the, laboratory, in, ordinary, conditions, any, quark, matter, formed, immediately, undergoes, radioactive, decay, strange, matter, is, a, type, of, quark, matter, that, is, suspected, to, exist, inside, some, neutron, stars, close, to, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, approximately, 2, 3, solar, masses, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, its, existence, in, strange, matter, part, of, the, energy, available, manifests, as, strange, quarks, a, heavier, analogue, of, the, common, down, quark, it, may, be, stable, at, lower, energy, states, once, formed, although, this, is, not, known, quark, gluon, plasma, is, a, very, high, temperature, phase, in, which, quarks, become, free, and, able, to, move, independently, rather, than, being, perpetually, bound, into, particles, in, a, sea, of, gluons, subatomic, particles, that, transmit, the, strong, force, that, binds, quarks, together, this, is, analogous, to, the, liberation, of, electrons, from, atoms, in, a, plasma, this, state, is, briefly, attainable, in, extremely, high, energy, heavy, ion, collisions, in, particle, accelerators, and, allows, scientists, to, observe, the, properties, of, individual, quarks, theories, predicting, the, existence, of, quark, gluon, plasma, were, developed, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, and, it, was, detected, for, the, first, time, in, the, laboratory, at, cern, in, the, year, 2000, unlike, plasma, which, flows, like, a, gas, interactions, within, qgp, are, strong, and, it, flows, like, a, liquid, at, high, densities, but, relatively, low, temperatures, quarks, are, theorized, to, form, a, quark, liquid, whose, nature, is, presently, unknown, it, forms, a, distinct, color, flavor, locked, cfl, phase, at, even, higher, densities, this, phase, is, superconductive, for, color, charge, these, phases, may, occur, in, neutron, stars, but, they, are, presently, theoretical, color, glass, condensate, is, a, type, of, matter, theorized, to, exist, in, atomic, nuclei, traveling, near, the, speed, of, light, according, to, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, a, high, energy, nucleus, appears, length, contracted, or, compressed, along, its, direction, of, motion, as, a, result, the, gluons, inside, the, nucleus, appear, to, a, stationary, observer, as, a, gluonic, wall, traveling, near, the, speed, of, light, at, very, high, energies, the, density, of, the, gluons, in, this, wall, is, seen, to, increase, greatly, unlike, the, quark, gluon, plasma, produced, in, the, collision, of, such, walls, the, color, glass, condensate, describes, the, walls, themselves, and, is, an, intrinsic, property, of, the, particles, that, can, only, be, observed, under, high, energy, conditions, such, as, those, at, rhic, and, possibly, at, the, large, hadron, collider, as, well, various, theories, predict, new, states, of, matter, at, very, high, energies, an, unknown, state, has, created, the, baryon, asymmetry, in, the, universe, but, little, is, known, about, it, in, string, theory, a, hagedorn, temperature, is, predicted, for, superstrings, at, about, 10, 30, k, where, superstrings, are, copiously, produced, at, planck, temperature, 10, 32, k, gravity, becomes, a, significant, force, between, individual, particles, no, current, theory, can, describe, these, states, and, they, cannot, be, produced, with, any, foreseeable, experiment, however, these, states, are, important, in, cosmology, because, the, universe, may, have, passed, through, these, states, in, the, big, bang, a, supersolid, is, a, spatially, ordered, material, that, is, a, solid, or, crystal, with, superfluid, properties, similar, to, a, superfluid, a, supersolid, is, able, to, move, without, friction, but, retains, a, rigid, shape, although, a, supersolid, is, a, solid, it, exhibits, so, many, characteristic, properties, different, from, other, solids, that, many, argue, it, is, another, state, of, matter, in, a, string, net, liquid, atoms, have, apparently, unstable, arrangement, like, a, liquid, but, are, still, consistent, in, overall, pattern, like, a, solid, when, in, a, normal, solid, state, the, atoms, of, matter, align, themselves, in, a, grid, pattern, so, that, the, spin, of, any, electron, is, the, opposite, of, the, spin, of, all, electrons, touching, it, but, in, a, string, net, liquid, atoms, are, arranged, in, some, pattern, that, requires, some, electrons, to, have, neighbors, with, the, same, spin, this, gives, rise, to, curious, properties, as, well, as, supporting, some, unusual, proposals, about, the, fundamental, conditions, of, the, universe, itself, a, superglass, is, a, phase, of, matter, characterized, at, the, same, time, by, superfluidity, and, a, frozen, amorphous, structure, metals, like, potassium, in, the, chain, melted, state, appear, to, be, in, the, liquid, and, solid, state, at, the, same, time, this, is, a, result, of, being, subjected, to, high, temperature, and, pressure, leading, to, the, chains, in, the, potassium, to, dissolve, into, liquid, while, the, crystals, remain, solid, a, quantum, hall, state, gives, rise, to, quantized, hall, voltage, measured, in, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, current, flow, a, quantum, spin, hall, state, is, a, theoretical, phase, that, may, pave, the, way, for, the, development, of, electronic, devices, that, dissipate, less, energy, and, generate, less, heat, this, is, a, derivation, of, the, quantum, hall, state, of, matter, photonic, matter, is, a, phenomenon, where, photons, interacting, with, a, gas, develop, apparent, mass, and, can, interact, with, each, other, even, forming, photonic, molecules, the, source, of, mass, is, the, gas, which, is, massive, this, is, in, contrast, to, photons, moving, in, empty, space, which, have, no, rest, mass, and, cannot, interact
