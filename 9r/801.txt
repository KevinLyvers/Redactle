limnology, l, m, n, l, d, i, lim, nol, jee, from, ancient, greek, l, mn, lake, and, log, a, study, of, is, the, study, of, inland, aquatic, ecosystems, the, study, of, limnology, includes, aspects, of, the, biological, chemical, physical, and, geological, characteristics, of, fresh, and, saline, natural, and, man, made, bodies, of, water, this, includes, the, study, of, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, springs, streams, wetlands, and, groundwater, water, systems, are, often, categorized, as, either, running, lotic, or, standing, lentic, limnology, includes, the, study, of, the, drainage, basin, movement, of, water, through, the, basin, and, biogeochemical, changes, that, occur, en, route, a, more, recent, sub, discipline, of, limnology, termed, landscape, limnology, studies, manages, and, seeks, to, conserve, these, ecosystems, using, a, landscape, perspective, by, explicitly, examining, connections, between, an, aquatic, ecosystem, and, its, drainage, basin, recently, the, need, to, understand, global, inland, waters, as, part, of, the, earth, system, created, a, sub, discipline, called, global, limnology, this, approach, considers, processes, in, inland, waters, on, a, global, scale, like, the, role, of, inland, aquatic, ecosystems, in, global, biogeochemical, cycles, limnology, is, closely, related, to, aquatic, ecology, and, hydrobiology, which, study, aquatic, organisms, and, their, interactions, with, the, abiotic, non, living, environment, while, limnology, has, substantial, overlap, with, freshwater, focused, disciplines, e, g, freshwater, biology, it, also, includes, the, study, of, inland, salt, lakes, the, term, limnology, was, coined, by, fran, ois, alphonse, forel, 1841, 1912, who, established, the, field, with, his, studies, of, lake, geneva, interest, in, the, discipline, rapidly, expanded, and, in, 1922, august, thienemann, a, german, zoologist, and, einar, naumann, a, swedish, botanist, co, founded, the, international, society, of, limnology, sil, from, societas, internationalis, limnologiae, forel, s, original, definition, of, limnology, the, oceanography, of, lakes, was, expanded, to, encompass, the, study, of, all, inland, waters, and, influenced, benedykt, dybowski, s, work, on, lake, baikal, prominent, early, american, limnologists, included, g, evelyn, hutchinson, and, ed, deevey, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, edward, a, birge, chancey, juday, charles, r, goldman, and, arthur, d, hasler, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, center, for, limnology, physical, properties, of, aquatic, ecosystems, are, determined, by, a, combination, of, heat, currents, waves, and, other, seasonal, distributions, of, environmental, conditions, the, morphometry, of, a, body, of, water, depends, on, the, type, of, feature, such, as, a, lake, river, stream, wetland, estuary, etc, and, the, structure, of, the, earth, surrounding, the, body, of, water, lakes, for, instance, are, classified, by, their, formation, and, zones, of, lakes, are, defined, by, water, depth, river, and, stream, system, morphometry, is, driven, by, underlying, geology, of, the, area, as, well, as, the, general, velocity, of, the, water, stream, morphometry, is, also, influenced, by, topography, especially, slope, as, well, as, precipitation, patterns, and, other, factors, such, as, vegetation, and, land, development, connectivity, between, streams, and, lakes, relates, to, the, landscape, drainage, density, lake, surface, area, and, lake, shape, other, types, of, aquatic, systems, which, fall, within, the, study, of, limnology, are, estuaries, estuaries, are, bodies, of, water, classified, by, the, interaction, of, a, river, and, the, ocean, or, sea, wetlands, vary, in, size, shape, and, pattern, however, the, most, common, types, marshes, bogs, and, swamps, often, fluctuate, between, containing, shallow, freshwater, and, being, dry, depending, on, the, time, of, year, the, volume, and, quality, of, water, in, underground, aquifers, rely, on, the, vegetation, cover, which, fosters, recharge, and, aids, in, maintaining, water, quality, light, zonation, is, the, concept, of, how, the, amount, of, sunlight, penetration, into, water, influences, the, structure, of, a, body, of, water, these, zones, define, various, levels, of, productivity, within, an, aquatic, ecosystems, such, as, a, lake, for, instance, the, depth, of, the, water, column, which, sunlight, is, able, to, penetrate, and, where, most, plant, life, is, able, to, grow, is, known, as, the, photic, or, euphotic, zone, the, rest, of, the, water, column, which, is, deeper, and, does, not, receive, sufficient, amounts, of, sunlight, for, plant, growth, is, known, as, the, aphotic, zone, the, amount, of, solar, energy, present, underwater, and, the, spectral, quality, of, the, light, that, are, present, at, various, depths, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, behavior, of, many, aquatic, organisms, for, example, zooplankton, s, vertical, migration, is, influenced, by, solar, energy, levels, similar, to, light, zonation, thermal, stratification, or, thermal, zonation, is, a, way, of, grouping, parts, of, the, water, body, within, an, aquatic, system, based, on, the, temperature, of, different, lake, layers, the, less, turbid, the, water, the, more, light, is, able, to, penetrate, and, thus, heat, is, conveyed, deeper, in, the, water, heating, declines, exponentially, with, depth, in, the, water, column, so, the, water, will, be, warmest, near, the, surface, but, progressively, cooler, as, moving, downwards, there, are, three, main, sections, that, define, thermal, stratification, in, a, lake, the, epilimnion, is, closest, to, the, water, surface, and, absorbs, long, and, shortwave, radiation, to, warm, the, water, surface, during, cooler, months, wind, shear, can, contribute, to, cooling, of, the, water, surface, the, thermocline, is, an, area, within, the, water, column, where, water, temperatures, rapidly, decrease, the, bottom, layer, is, the, hypolimnion, which, tends, to, have, the, coldest, water, because, its, depth, restricts, sunlight, from, reaching, it, in, temperate, lakes, fall, season, cooling, of, surface, water, results, in, turnover, of, the, water, column, where, the, thermocline, is, disrupted, and, the, lake, temperature, profile, becomes, more, uniform, in, cold, climates, when, water, cools, below, 4, o, c, the, temperature, of, maximum, density, many, lakes, can, experience, an, inverse, thermal, stratification, in, winter, these, lakes, are, often, dimictic, with, a, brief, spring, overturn, in, addition, to, longer, fall, overturn, the, relative, thermal, resistance, is, the, energy, needed, to, mix, these, strata, of, different, temperatures, an, annual, heat, budget, also, shown, as, a, is, the, total, amount, of, heat, needed, to, raise, the, water, from, its, minimum, winter, temperature, to, its, maximum, summer, temperature, this, can, be, calculated, by, integrating, the, area, of, the, lake, at, each, depth, interval, a, z, multiplied, by, the, difference, between, the, summer, sz, and, winter, wz, temperatures, or, displaystyle, displaystyle, int, a, z, sz, wz, the, chemical, composition, of, water, in, aquatic, ecosystems, is, influenced, by, natural, characteristics, and, processes, including, precipitation, underlying, soil, and, bedrock, in, the, drainage, basin, erosion, evaporation, and, sedimentation, all, bodies, of, water, have, a, certain, composition, of, both, organic, and, inorganic, elements, and, compounds, biological, reactions, also, affect, the, chemical, properties, of, water, in, addition, to, natural, processes, human, activities, strongly, influence, the, chemical, composition, of, aquatic, systems, and, their, water, quality, allochthonous, sources, of, carbon, or, nutrients, come, from, outside, the, aquatic, system, such, as, plant, and, soil, material, carbon, sources, from, within, the, system, such, as, algae, and, the, microbial, breakdown, of, aquatic, particulate, organic, carbon, are, autochthonous, in, aquatic, food, webs, the, portion, of, biomass, derived, from, allochthonous, material, is, then, named, allochthony, in, streams, and, small, lakes, allochthonous, sources, of, carbon, are, dominant, while, in, large, lakes, and, the, ocean, autochthonous, sources, dominate, dissolved, oxygen, and, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, are, often, discussed, together, due, their, coupled, role, in, respiration, and, photosynthesis, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, can, be, altered, by, physical, chemical, and, biological, processes, and, reaction, physical, processes, including, wind, mixing, can, increase, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, particularly, in, surface, waters, of, aquatic, ecosystems, because, dissolved, oxygen, solubility, is, linked, to, water, temperatures, changes, in, temperature, affect, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, as, warmer, water, has, a, lower, capacity, to, hold, oxygen, as, colder, water, biologically, both, photosynthesis, and, aerobic, respiration, affect, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, photosynthesis, by, autotrophic, organisms, such, as, phytoplankton, and, aquatic, algae, increases, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, while, simultaneously, reducing, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, since, carbon, dioxide, is, taken, up, during, photosynthesis, all, aerobic, organisms, in, the, aquatic, environment, take, up, dissolved, oxygen, during, aerobic, respiration, while, carbon, dioxide, is, released, as, a, byproduct, of, this, reaction, because, photosynthesis, is, light, limited, both, photosynthesis, and, respiration, occur, during, the, daylight, hours, while, only, respiration, occurs, during, dark, hours, or, in, dark, portions, of, an, ecosystem, the, balance, between, dissolved, oxygen, production, and, consumption, is, calculated, as, the, aquatic, metabolism, rate, vertical, changes, in, the, concentrations, of, dissolved, oxygen, are, affected, by, both, wind, mixing, of, surface, waters, and, the, balance, between, photosynthesis, and, respiration, of, organic, matter, these, vertical, changes, known, as, profiles, are, based, on, similar, principles, as, thermal, stratification, and, light, penetration, as, light, availability, decreases, deeper, in, the, water, column, photosynthesis, rates, also, decrease, and, less, dissolved, oxygen, is, produced, this, means, that, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, generally, decrease, as, you, move, deeper, into, the, body, of, water, because, of, photosynthesis, is, not, replenishing, dissolved, oxygen, that, is, being, taken, up, through, respiration, during, periods, of, thermal, stratification, water, density, gradients, prevent, oxygen, rich, surface, waters, from, mixing, with, deeper, waters, prolonged, periods, of, stratification, can, result, in, the, depletion, of, bottom, water, dissolved, oxygen, when, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, are, below, 2, milligrams, per, liter, waters, are, considered, hypoxic, when, dissolved, oxygen, concentrations, are, approximately, 0, milligrams, per, liter, conditions, are, anoxic, both, hypoxic, and, anoxic, waters, reduce, available, habitat, for, organisms, that, respire, oxygen, and, contribute, to, changes, in, other, chemical, reactions, in, the, water, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, are, ecologically, significant, nutrients, in, aquatic, systems, nitrogen, is, generally, present, as, a, gas, in, aquatic, ecosystems, however, most, water, quality, studies, tend, to, focus, on, nitrate, nitrite, and, ammonia, levels, most, of, these, dissolved, nitrogen, compounds, follow, a, seasonal, pattern, with, greater, concentrations, in, the, fall, and, winter, months, compared, to, the, spring, and, summer, phosphorus, has, a, different, role, in, aquatic, ecosystems, as, it, is, a, limiting, factor, in, the, growth, of, phytoplankton, because, of, generally, low, concentrations, in, the, water, dissolved, phosphorus, is, also, crucial, to, all, living, things, is, often, very, limiting, to, primary, productivity, in, freshwater, and, has, its, own, distinctive, ecosystem, cycling, lakes, are, relatively, easy, to, sample, because, they, have, clear, cut, boundaries, compared, to, terrestrial, ecosystems, and, because, field, experiments, are, relatively, easy, to, perform, which, make, then, especially, useful, for, ecologists, who, try, to, understand, ecological, dynamics, one, way, to, classify, lakes, or, other, bodies, of, water, is, with, the, trophic, state, index, an, oligotrophic, lake, is, characterized, by, relatively, low, levels, of, primary, production, and, low, levels, of, nutrients, a, eutrophic, lake, has, high, levels, of, primary, productivity, due, to, very, high, nutrient, levels, eutrophication, of, a, lake, can, lead, to, algal, blooms, dystrophic, lakes, have, high, levels, of, humic, matter, and, typically, have, yellow, brown, tea, coloured, waters, these, categories, do, not, have, rigid, specifications, the, classification, system, can, be, seen, as, more, of, a, spectrum, encompassing, the, various, levels, of, aquatic, productivity, tropical, limnology, is, a, unique, and, important, subfield, of, limnology, that, focuses, on, the, distinct, physical, chemical, biological, and, cultural, aspects, of, freshwater, systems, in, tropical, regions, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, tropical, aquatic, environments, are, different, from, those, in, temperate, regions, with, warmer, and, more, stable, temperatures, higher, nutrient, levels, and, more, complex, ecological, interactions, moreover, the, biodiversity, of, tropical, freshwater, systems, is, typically, higher, human, impacts, are, often, more, severe, and, there, are, important, cultural, and, socioeconomic, factors, that, influence, the, use, and, management, of, these, systems, people, who, study, limnology, are, called, limnologists, these, scientists, largely, study, the, characteristics, of, inland, fresh, water, systems, such, as, lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and, wetlands, they, may, also, study, non, oceanic, bodies, of, salt, water, such, as, the, great, salt, lake, there, are, many, professional, organizations, related, to, limnology, and, other, aspects, of, the, aquatic, science, including, the, association, for, the, sciences, of, limnology, and, oceanography, the, asociaci, n, ib, rica, de, limnolog, a, the, international, society, of, limnology, the, polish, limnological, society, the, society, of, canadian, limnologists, and, the, freshwater, biological, association
