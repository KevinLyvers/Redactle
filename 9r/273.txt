brown, dwarfs, are, substellar, objects, that, have, more, mass, than, the, biggest, gas, giant, planets, but, less, than, the, least, massive, main, sequence, stars, their, mass, is, approximately, 13, to, 80, times, that, of, jupiter, m, j, not, big, enough, to, sustain, nuclear, fusion, of, ordinary, hydrogen, 1, h, into, helium, in, their, cores, but, massive, enough, to, emit, some, light, and, heat, from, the, fusion, of, deuterium, 2, h, the, most, massive, ones, 65, m, j, can, fuse, lithium, 7, li, astronomers, classify, self, luminous, objects, by, spectral, type, a, distinction, intimately, tied, to, the, surface, temperature, and, brown, dwarfs, occupy, types, m, l, t, and, y, as, brown, dwarfs, do, not, undergo, stable, hydrogen, fusion, they, cool, down, over, time, progressively, passing, through, later, spectral, types, as, they, age, their, name, comes, not, from, the, color, of, light, they, emit, but, from, their, falling, between, white, dwarf, stars, and, dark, planets, in, size, to, the, naked, eye, brown, dwarfs, would, appear, in, different, colors, depending, on, their, temperature, the, warmest, ones, are, possibly, orange, or, red, while, cooler, brown, dwarfs, would, likely, appear, magenta, or, black, to, the, human, eye, brown, dwarfs, may, be, fully, convective, with, no, layers, or, chemical, differentiation, by, depth, though, their, existence, was, initially, theorized, in, the, 1960s, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 1990s, that, the, first, unambiguous, brown, dwarfs, were, discovered, as, brown, dwarfs, have, relatively, low, surface, temperatures, they, are, not, very, bright, at, visible, wavelengths, emitting, most, of, their, light, in, the, infrared, however, with, the, advent, of, more, capable, infrared, detecting, devices, thousands, of, brown, dwarfs, have, been, identified, the, nearest, known, brown, dwarfs, are, located, in, the, luhman, 16, system, a, binary, of, l, and, t, type, brown, dwarfs, about, 6, 5, light, years, 2, 0, parsecs, from, the, sun, luhman, 16, is, the, third, closest, system, to, the, sun, after, alpha, centauri, and, barnard, s, star, the, objects, now, called, brown, dwarfs, were, theorized, by, shiv, s, kumar, in, the, 1960s, to, exist, and, were, originally, called, black, dwarfs, a, classification, for, dark, substellar, objects, floating, freely, in, space, that, were, not, massive, enough, to, sustain, hydrogen, fusion, however, a, the, term, black, dwarf, was, already, in, use, to, refer, to, a, cold, white, dwarf, b, red, dwarfs, fuse, hydrogen, and, c, these, objects, may, be, luminous, at, visible, wavelengths, early, in, their, lives, because, of, this, alternative, names, for, these, objects, were, proposed, including, planetar, and, substar, in, 1975, jill, tarter, suggested, the, term, brown, dwarf, using, brown, as, an, approximate, color, the, term, black, dwarf, still, refers, to, a, white, dwarf, that, has, cooled, to, the, point, that, it, no, longer, emits, significant, amounts, of, light, however, the, time, required, for, even, the, lowest, mass, white, dwarf, to, cool, to, this, temperature, is, calculated, to, be, longer, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, hence, such, objects, are, expected, to, not, yet, exist, early, theories, concerning, the, nature, of, the, lowest, mass, stars, and, the, hydrogen, burning, limit, suggested, that, a, population, i, object, with, a, mass, less, than, 0, 07, solar, masses, m, or, a, population, ii, object, less, than, 0, 09, m, would, never, go, through, normal, stellar, evolution, and, would, become, a, completely, degenerate, star, the, first, self, consistent, calculation, of, the, hydrogen, burning, minimum, mass, confirmed, a, value, between, 0, 07, and, 0, 08, solar, masses, for, population, i, objects, the, discovery, of, deuterium, burning, down, to, 0, 013, m, 13, 6, m, j, and, the, impact, of, dust, formation, in, the, cool, outer, atmospheres, of, brown, dwarfs, in, the, late, 1980s, brought, these, theories, into, question, however, such, objects, were, hard, to, find, because, they, emit, almost, no, visible, light, their, strongest, emissions, are, in, the, infrared, ir, spectrum, and, ground, based, ir, detectors, were, too, imprecise, at, that, time, to, readily, identify, any, brown, dwarfs, since, then, numerous, searches, by, various, methods, have, sought, these, objects, these, methods, included, multi, color, imaging, surveys, around, field, stars, imaging, surveys, for, faint, companions, of, main, sequence, dwarfs, and, white, dwarfs, surveys, of, young, star, clusters, and, radial, velocity, monitoring, for, close, companions, for, many, years, efforts, to, discover, brown, dwarfs, were, fruitless, in, 1988, however, a, faint, companion, to, the, white, dwarf, star, gd, 165, was, found, in, an, infrared, search, of, white, dwarfs, the, spectrum, of, the, companion, gd, 165b, was, very, red, and, enigmatic, showing, none, of, the, features, expected, of, a, low, mass, red, dwarf, it, became, clear, that, gd, 165b, would, need, to, be, classified, as, a, much, cooler, object, than, the, latest, m, dwarfs, then, known, gd, 165b, remained, unique, for, almost, a, decade, until, the, advent, of, the, two, micron, all, sky, survey, 2mass, in, 1997, which, discovered, many, objects, with, similar, colors, and, spectral, features, today, gd, 165b, is, recognized, as, the, prototype, of, a, class, of, objects, now, called, l, dwarfs, although, the, discovery, of, the, coolest, dwarf, was, highly, significant, at, the, time, it, was, debated, whether, gd, 165b, would, be, classified, as, a, brown, dwarf, or, simply, a, very, low, mass, star, because, observationally, it, is, very, difficult, to, distinguish, between, the, two, soon, after, the, discovery, of, gd, 165b, other, brown, dwarf, candidates, were, reported, most, failed, to, live, up, to, their, candidacy, however, because, the, absence, of, lithium, showed, them, to, be, stellar, objects, true, stars, burn, their, lithium, within, a, little, over, 100, myr, whereas, brown, dwarfs, which, can, confusingly, have, temperatures, and, luminosities, similar, to, true, stars, will, not, hence, the, detection, of, lithium, in, the, atmosphere, of, an, object, older, than, 100, myr, ensures, that, it, is, a, brown, dwarf, the, first, class, t, brown, dwarf, was, discovered, in, 1994, by, caltech, astronomers, shrinivas, kulkarni, tadashi, nakajima, keith, matthews, and, rebecca, oppenheimer, and, johns, hopkins, scientists, samuel, t, durrance, and, david, golimowski, it, was, confirmed, in, 1995, as, a, substellar, companion, to, gliese, 229, gliese, 229b, is, one, of, the, first, two, instances, of, clear, evidence, for, a, brown, dwarf, along, with, teide, 1, confirmed, in, 1995, both, were, identified, by, the, presence, of, the, 670, 8, nm, lithium, line, the, latter, was, found, to, have, a, temperature, and, luminosity, well, below, the, stellar, range, its, near, infrared, spectrum, clearly, exhibited, a, methane, absorption, band, at, 2, micrometres, a, feature, that, had, previously, only, been, observed, in, the, atmospheres, of, giant, planets, and, that, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, methane, absorption, is, not, expected, at, any, temperature, of, a, main, sequence, star, this, discovery, helped, to, establish, yet, another, spectral, class, even, cooler, than, l, dwarfs, known, as, t, dwarfs, for, which, gliese, 229b, is, the, prototype, the, first, confirmed, class, m, brown, dwarf, was, discovered, by, spanish, astrophysicists, rafael, rebolo, head, of, the, team, mar, a, rosa, zapatero, osorio, and, eduardo, l, mart, n, in, 1994, this, object, found, in, the, pleiades, open, cluster, received, the, name, teide, 1, the, discovery, article, was, submitted, to, nature, in, may, 1995, and, published, on, 14, september, 1995, nature, highlighted, brown, dwarfs, discovered, official, on, the, front, page, of, that, issue, teide, 1, was, discovered, in, images, collected, by, the, iac, team, on, 6, january, 1994, using, the, 80, cm, telescope, iac, 80, at, teide, observatory, and, its, spectrum, was, first, recorded, in, december, 1994, using, the, 4, 2, m, william, herschel, telescope, at, roque, de, los, muchachos, observatory, la, palma, the, distance, chemical, composition, and, age, of, teide, 1, could, be, established, because, of, its, membership, in, the, young, pleiades, star, cluster, using, the, most, advanced, stellar, and, substellar, evolution, models, at, that, moment, the, team, estimated, for, teide, 1, a, mass, of, 55, 15, m, j, which, is, below, the, stellar, mass, limit, the, object, became, a, reference, in, subsequent, young, brown, dwarf, related, works, in, theory, a, brown, dwarf, below, 65, m, j, is, unable, to, burn, lithium, by, thermonuclear, fusion, at, any, time, during, its, evolution, this, fact, is, one, of, the, lithium, test, principles, used, to, judge, the, substellar, nature, of, low, luminosity, and, low, surface, temperature, astronomical, bodies, high, quality, spectral, data, acquired, by, the, keck, 1, telescope, in, november, 1995, showed, that, teide, 1, still, had, the, initial, lithium, abundance, of, the, original, molecular, cloud, from, which, pleiades, stars, formed, proving, the, lack, of, thermonuclear, fusion, in, its, core, these, observations, confirmed, that, teide, 1, is, a, brown, dwarf, as, well, as, the, efficiency, of, the, spectroscopic, lithium, test, for, some, time, teide, 1, was, the, smallest, known, object, outside, the, solar, system, that, had, been, identified, by, direct, observation, since, then, over, 1, 800, brown, dwarfs, have, been, identified, even, some, very, close, to, earth, like, epsilon, indi, ba, and, bb, a, pair, of, brown, dwarfs, gravitationally, bound, to, a, sun, like, star, 12, light, years, from, the, sun, and, luhman, 16, a, binary, system, of, brown, dwarfs, at, 6, 5, light, years, from, the, sun, the, standard, mechanism, for, star, birth, is, through, the, gravitational, collapse, of, a, cold, interstellar, cloud, of, gas, and, dust, as, the, cloud, contracts, it, heats, due, to, the, kelvin, helmholtz, mechanism, early, in, the, process, the, contracting, gas, quickly, radiates, away, much, of, the, energy, allowing, the, collapse, to, continue, eventually, the, central, region, becomes, sufficiently, dense, to, trap, radiation, consequently, the, central, temperature, and, density, of, the, collapsed, cloud, increase, dramatically, with, time, slowing, the, contraction, until, the, conditions, are, hot, and, dense, enough, for, thermonuclear, reactions, to, occur, in, the, core, of, the, protostar, for, a, typical, star, gas, and, radiation, pressure, generated, by, the, thermonuclear, fusion, reactions, within, its, core, will, support, it, against, any, further, gravitational, contraction, hydrostatic, equilibrium, is, reached, and, the, star, will, spend, most, of, its, lifetime, fusing, hydrogen, into, helium, as, a, main, sequence, star, if, however, the, initial, mass, of, the, protostar, is, less, than, about, 0, 08, m, normal, hydrogen, thermonuclear, fusion, reactions, will, not, ignite, in, the, core, gravitational, contraction, does, not, heat, the, small, protostar, very, effectively, and, before, the, temperature, in, the, core, can, increase, enough, to, trigger, fusion, the, density, reaches, the, point, where, electrons, become, closely, packed, enough, to, create, quantum, electron, degeneracy, pressure, according, to, the, brown, dwarf, interior, models, typical, conditions, in, the, core, for, density, temperature, and, pressure, are, expected, to, be, the, following, this, means, that, the, protostar, is, not, massive, or, dense, enough, ever, to, reach, the, conditions, needed, to, sustain, hydrogen, fusion, the, infalling, matter, is, prevented, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, from, reaching, the, densities, and, pressures, needed, further, gravitational, contraction, is, prevented, and, the, result, is, a, brown, dwarf, that, simply, cools, off, by, radiating, away, its, internal, thermal, energy, note, that, in, principle, it, is, possible, for, a, brown, dwarf, to, slowly, accrete, mass, above, the, hydrogen, burning, limit, without, initiating, hydrogen, fusion, this, could, happen, via, mass, transfer, in, a, binary, brown, dwarf, system, lithium, is, generally, present, in, brown, dwarfs, and, not, in, low, mass, stars, stars, which, reach, the, high, temperature, necessary, for, fusing, hydrogen, rapidly, deplete, their, lithium, fusion, of, lithium, 7, and, a, proton, occurs, producing, two, helium, 4, nuclei, the, temperature, necessary, for, this, reaction, is, just, below, that, necessary, for, hydrogen, fusion, convection, in, low, mass, stars, ensures, that, lithium, in, the, whole, volume, of, the, star, is, eventually, depleted, therefore, the, presence, of, the, lithium, spectral, line, in, a, candidate, brown, dwarf, is, a, strong, indicator, that, it, is, indeed, a, substellar, object, the, use, of, lithium, to, distinguish, candidate, brown, dwarfs, from, low, mass, stars, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, lithium, test, and, was, pioneered, by, rafael, rebolo, eduardo, mart, n, and, antonio, magazzu, however, lithium, is, also, seen, in, very, young, stars, which, have, not, yet, had, enough, time, to, burn, it, all, heavier, stars, like, the, sun, can, also, retain, lithium, in, their, outer, layers, which, never, get, hot, enough, to, fuse, lithium, and, whose, convective, layer, does, not, mix, with, the, core, where, the, lithium, would, be, rapidly, depleted, those, larger, stars, are, easily, distinguishable, from, brown, dwarfs, by, their, size, and, luminosity, conversely, brown, dwarfs, at, the, high, end, of, their, mass, range, can, be, hot, enough, to, deplete, their, lithium, when, they, are, young, dwarfs, of, mass, greater, than, 65, m, j, can, burn, their, lithium, by, the, time, they, are, half, a, billion, years, old, thus, the, lithium, test, is, not, perfect, unlike, stars, older, brown, dwarfs, are, sometimes, cool, enough, that, over, very, long, periods, of, time, their, atmospheres, can, gather, observable, quantities, of, methane, which, cannot, form, in, hotter, objects, dwarfs, confirmed, in, this, fashion, include, gliese, 229, b, main, sequence, stars, cool, but, eventually, reach, a, minimum, bolometric, luminosity, that, they, can, sustain, through, steady, fusion, this, luminosity, varies, from, star, to, star, but, is, generally, at, least, 0, 01, that, of, the, sun, brown, dwarfs, cool, and, darken, steadily, over, their, lifetimes, sufficiently, old, brown, dwarfs, will, be, too, faint, to, be, detectable, clouds, are, used, to, explain, the, weakening, of, the, iron, hydride, feh, spectral, line, in, late, l, dwarfs, iron, clouds, deplete, feh, in, the, upper, atmosphere, and, the, cloud, layer, blocks, the, view, to, lower, layers, still, containing, feh, the, later, strengthening, of, this, chemical, compound, at, cooler, temperatures, of, mid, to, late, t, dwarfs, is, explained, by, disturbed, clouds, that, allows, a, telescope, to, look, into, the, deeper, layers, of, the, atmosphere, that, still, contains, feh, young, l, t, dwarfs, l2, t4, show, high, variability, which, could, be, explained, with, clouds, hot, spots, magnetically, driven, aurorae, or, thermochemical, instabilities, the, clouds, of, these, brown, dwarfs, are, explained, as, either, iron, clouds, with, varying, thickness, or, a, lower, thick, iron, cloud, layer, and, an, upper, silicate, cloud, layer, this, upper, silicate, cloud, layer, can, consist, out, of, quartz, enstatite, corundum, and, or, fosterite, it, is, however, not, clear, if, silicate, clouds, are, always, necessary, for, young, objects, silicate, absorption, can, be, directly, observed, in, the, mid, infrared, at, 8, to, 12, m, observations, with, spitzer, irs, have, shown, that, silicate, absorption, is, common, but, not, ubiquitous, for, l2, l8, dwarfs, additionally, miri, has, observed, silicate, absorption, in, the, planetary, mass, companion, vhs, 1256b, iron, rain, as, part, of, atmospheric, convection, processes, is, possible, only, in, brown, dwarfs, and, not, in, small, stars, the, spectroscopy, research, into, iron, rain, is, still, ongoing, but, not, all, brown, dwarfs, will, always, have, this, atmospheric, anomaly, in, 2013, a, heterogeneous, iron, containing, atmosphere, was, imaged, around, the, b, component, in, the, nearby, luhman, 16, system, for, late, t, type, brown, dwarfs, only, a, few, variable, searches, were, carried, out, thin, cloud, layers, are, predicted, to, form, in, late, t, dwarfs, from, chromium, and, potassium, chloride, as, well, as, several, sulfides, these, sulfides, are, manganese, sulfide, sodium, sulfide, and, zinc, sulfide, the, variable, t7, dwarf, 2m0050, 3322, is, explained, to, have, a, top, layer, of, potassium, chloride, clouds, a, mid, layer, of, sodium, sulfide, clouds, and, a, lower, layer, of, manganese, sulfide, clouds, patchy, clouds, of, the, top, two, cloud, layers, could, explain, why, the, methane, and, water, vapor, bands, are, variable, at, the, lowest, temperatures, of, the, y, dwarf, wise, 0855, 0714, patchy, cloud, layers, of, sulfide, and, water, ice, clouds, could, cover, 50, of, the, surface, like, stars, brown, dwarfs, form, independently, but, unlike, stars, they, lack, sufficient, mass, to, ignite, hydrogen, fusion, like, all, stars, they, can, occur, singly, or, in, close, proximity, to, other, stars, some, orbit, stars, and, can, like, planets, have, eccentric, orbits, brown, dwarfs, are, all, roughly, the, same, radius, as, jupiter, at, the, high, end, of, their, mass, range, 60, 90, m, j, the, volume, of, a, brown, dwarf, is, governed, primarily, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, as, it, is, in, white, dwarfs, at, the, low, end, of, the, range, 10, m, j, their, volume, is, governed, primarily, by, coulomb, pressure, as, it, is, in, planets, the, net, result, is, that, the, radii, of, brown, dwarfs, vary, by, only, 10, 15, over, the, range, of, possible, masses, moreover, the, mass, radius, relationship, shows, no, change, from, about, one, saturn, mass, to, the, onset, of, hydrogen, burning, 0, 080, 0, 008, m, suggesting, that, from, this, perspective, brown, dwarfs, are, simply, high, mass, jovian, planets, this, can, make, distinguishing, them, from, planets, difficult, in, addition, many, brown, dwarfs, undergo, no, fusion, even, those, at, the, high, end, of, the, mass, range, over, 60, m, j, cool, quickly, enough, that, after, 10, million, years, they, no, longer, undergo, fusion, x, ray, and, infrared, spectra, are, telltale, signs, of, brown, dwarfs, some, emit, x, rays, and, all, warm, dwarfs, continue, to, glow, tellingly, in, the, red, and, infrared, spectra, until, they, cool, to, planet, like, temperatures, under, 1, 000, k, gas, giants, have, some, of, the, characteristics, of, brown, dwarfs, like, the, sun, jupiter, and, saturn, are, both, made, primarily, of, hydrogen, and, helium, saturn, is, nearly, as, large, as, jupiter, despite, having, only, 30, the, mass, three, of, the, giant, planets, in, the, solar, system, jupiter, saturn, and, neptune, emit, much, more, up, to, about, twice, heat, than, they, receive, from, the, sun, all, four, giant, planets, have, their, own, planetary, systems, in, the, form, of, extensive, moon, systems, currently, the, international, astronomical, union, considers, an, object, above, 13, m, j, the, limiting, mass, for, thermonuclear, fusion, of, deuterium, to, be, a, brown, dwarf, whereas, an, object, under, that, mass, and, orbiting, a, star, or, stellar, remnant, is, considered, a, planet, the, minimum, mass, required, to, trigger, sustained, hydrogen, burning, about, 80, m, j, forms, the, upper, limit, of, the, definition, it, is, also, debated, whether, brown, dwarfs, would, be, better, defined, by, their, formation, process, rather, than, by, theoretical, mass, limits, based, on, nuclear, fusion, reactions, under, this, interpretation, brown, dwarfs, are, those, objects, that, represent, the, lowest, mass, products, of, the, star, formation, process, while, planets, are, objects, formed, in, an, accretion, disk, surrounding, a, star, the, coolest, free, floating, objects, discovered, such, as, wise, 0855, as, well, as, the, lowest, mass, young, objects, known, like, pso, j318, 5, 22, are, thought, to, have, masses, below, 13, m, j, and, as, a, result, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, planetary, mass, objects, due, to, the, ambiguity, of, whether, they, should, be, regarded, as, rogue, planets, or, brown, dwarfs, there, are, planetary, mass, objects, known, to, orbit, brown, dwarfs, such, as, 2m1207b, moa, 2007, blg, 192lb, 2mass, j044144b, and, oph, 98, b, the, 13, jupiter, mass, cutoff, is, a, rule, of, thumb, rather, than, a, quantity, with, precise, physical, significance, larger, objects, will, burn, most, of, their, deuterium, and, smaller, ones, will, burn, only, a, little, and, the, 13, jupiter, mass, value, is, somewhere, in, between, the, amount, of, deuterium, burnt, also, depends, to, some, extent, on, the, composition, of, the, object, specifically, on, the, amount, of, helium, and, deuterium, present, and, on, the, fraction, of, heavier, elements, which, determines, the, atmospheric, opacity, and, thus, the, radiative, cooling, rate, as, of, 2011, the, extrasolar, planets, encyclopaedia, included, objects, up, to, 25, jupiter, masses, saying, the, fact, that, there, is, no, special, feature, around, 13, m, jup, in, the, observed, mass, spectrum, reinforces, the, choice, to, forget, this, mass, limit, as, of, 2016, this, limit, was, increased, to, 60, jupiter, masses, based, on, a, study, of, mass, density, relationships, the, exoplanet, data, explorer, includes, objects, up, to, 24, jupiter, masses, with, the, advisory, the, 13, jupiter, mass, distinction, by, the, iau, working, group, is, physically, unmotivated, for, planets, with, rocky, cores, and, observationally, problematic, due, to, the, sin, i, ambiguity, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, includes, objects, with, a, mass, or, minimum, mass, equal, to, or, less, than, 30, jupiter, masses, objects, below, 13, m, j, called, sub, brown, dwarfs, or, planetary, mass, brown, dwarfs, form, in, the, same, manner, as, stars, and, brown, dwarfs, i, e, through, the, collapse, of, a, gas, cloud, but, have, a, mass, below, the, limiting, mass, for, thermonuclear, fusion, of, deuterium, some, researchers, call, them, free, floating, planets, whereas, others, call, them, planetary, mass, brown, dwarfs, while, spectroscopic, features, can, help, to, distinguish, between, low, mass, stars, and, brown, dwarfs, it, is, often, necessary, to, estimate, the, mass, to, come, to, a, conclusion, the, theory, behind, the, mass, estimate, is, that, brown, dwarfs, with, a, similar, mass, form, in, a, similar, way, and, are, hot, when, they, form, some, have, spectral, types, that, are, similar, to, low, mass, stars, such, as, 2m1101ab, as, they, cool, down, the, brown, dwarfs, should, retain, a, range, of, luminosities, depending, on, the, mass, without, the, age, and, luminosity, a, mass, estimate, is, difficult, for, example, an, l, type, brown, dwarf, could, be, an, old, brown, dwarf, with, a, high, mass, possibly, a, low, mass, star, or, a, young, brown, dwarf, with, a, very, low, mass, for, y, dwarfs, this, is, less, of, a, problem, as, they, remain, low, mass, objects, near, the, sub, brown, dwarf, limit, even, for, relatively, high, age, estimates, for, l, and, t, dwarfs, it, is, still, useful, to, have, an, accurate, age, estimate, the, luminosity, is, here, the, less, concerning, property, as, this, can, be, estimated, from, the, spectral, energy, distribution, the, age, estimate, can, be, done, in, two, ways, either, the, brown, dwarf, is, young, and, still, has, spectral, features, that, are, associated, with, youth, or, the, brown, dwarf, co, moves, with, a, star, or, stellar, group, star, cluster, or, association, where, age, estimates, are, easier, to, obtain, a, very, young, brown, dwarf, that, was, further, studied, with, this, method, is, 2m1207, and, the, companion, 2m1207b, based, on, the, location, proper, motion, and, spectral, signature, this, object, was, determined, to, belong, to, the, 8, million, year, old, tw, hydrae, association, and, the, mass, of, the, secondary, was, determined, to, be, 8, 2, m, j, below, the, deuterium, burning, limit, an, example, of, a, very, old, age, obtained, by, the, co, movement, method, is, the, brown, dwarf, white, dwarf, binary, coconuts, 1, with, the, white, dwarf, estimated, to, be, 7, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, billion, years, old, in, this, case, the, mass, was, not, estimated, with, the, derived, age, but, the, co, movement, provided, an, accurate, distance, estimate, using, gaia, parallax, using, this, measurement, the, authors, estimated, the, radius, which, was, then, used, to, estimate, the, mass, for, the, brown, dwarf, as, 15, 4, 0, 9, 0, 8, m, j, these, are, brown, dwarfs, with, a, spectral, class, of, m5, 5, or, later, they, are, also, called, late, m, dwarfs, some, scientists, regard, them, as, red, dwarfs, all, brown, dwarfs, with, spectral, type, m, are, young, objects, such, as, teide, 1, which, is, the, first, m, type, brown, dwarf, discovered, and, lp, 944, 20, the, closest, m, type, brown, dwarf, the, defining, characteristic, of, spectral, class, m, the, coolest, type, in, the, long, standing, classical, stellar, sequence, is, an, optical, spectrum, dominated, by, absorption, bands, of, titanium, ii, oxide, tio, and, vanadium, ii, oxide, vo, molecules, however, gd, 165, b, the, cool, companion, to, the, white, dwarf, gd, 165, had, none, of, the, hallmark, tio, features, of, m, dwarfs, the, subsequent, identification, of, many, objects, like, gd, 165b, ultimately, led, to, the, definition, of, a, new, spectral, class, the, l, dwarfs, defined, in, the, red, optical, region, of, the, spectrum, not, by, metal, oxide, absorption, bands, tio, vo, but, by, metal, hydride, emission, bands, feh, crh, mgh, cah, and, prominent, atomic, lines, of, alkali, metals, na, k, rb, cs, as, of, 2013, over, 900, l, dwarfs, had, been, identified, most, by, wide, field, surveys, the, two, micron, all, sky, survey, 2mass, the, deep, near, infrared, survey, of, the, southern, sky, denis, and, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, sdss, this, spectral, class, also, contains, the, coolest, main, sequence, stars, 80, m, j, which, have, spectral, classes, l2, to, l6, as, gd, 165b, is, the, prototype, of, the, l, dwarfs, gliese, 229, b, is, the, prototype, of, a, second, new, spectral, class, the, t, dwarfs, t, dwarfs, are, pinkish, magenta, whereas, near, infrared, nir, spectra, of, l, dwarfs, show, strong, absorption, bands, of, h, 2, o, and, carbon, monoxide, co, the, nir, spectrum, of, gliese, 229b, is, dominated, by, absorption, bands, from, methane, ch, 4, a, feature, which, in, the, solar, system, is, found, only, in, the, giant, planets, and, titan, ch, 4, h, 2, o, and, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, collision, induced, absorption, cia, give, gliese, 229b, blue, near, infrared, colors, its, steeply, sloped, red, optical, spectrum, also, lacks, the, feh, and, crh, bands, that, characterize, l, dwarfs, and, instead, is, influenced, by, exceptionally, broad, absorption, features, from, the, alkali, metals, na, and, k, these, differences, led, j, davy, kirkpatrick, to, propose, the, t, spectral, class, for, objects, exhibiting, h, and, k, band, ch, 4, absorption, as, of, 2013, 355, t, dwarfs, were, known, nir, classification, schemes, for, t, dwarfs, have, recently, been, developed, by, adam, burgasser, and, tom, geballe, theory, suggests, that, l, dwarfs, are, a, mixture, of, very, low, mass, stars, and, sub, stellar, objects, brown, dwarfs, whereas, the, t, dwarf, class, is, composed, entirely, of, brown, dwarfs, because, of, the, absorption, of, sodium, and, potassium, in, the, green, part, of, the, spectrum, of, t, dwarfs, the, actual, appearance, of, t, dwarfs, to, human, visual, perception, is, estimated, to, be, not, brown, but, magenta, t, class, brown, dwarfs, such, as, wise, 0316, 4307, have, been, detected, more, than, 100, light, years, from, the, sun, in, 2009, the, coolest, known, brown, dwarfs, had, estimated, effective, temperatures, between, 500, and, 600, k, 227, 327, c, 440, 620, f, and, have, been, assigned, the, spectral, class, t9, three, examples, are, the, brown, dwarfs, cfbds, j005910, 90, 011401, 3, ulas, j133553, 45, 113005, 2, and, ulas, j003402, 77, 005206, 7, the, spectra, of, these, objects, have, absorption, peaks, around, 1, 55, micrometres, delorme, et, al, have, suggested, that, this, feature, is, due, to, absorption, from, ammonia, and, that, this, should, be, taken, as, indicating, the, t, y, transition, making, these, objects, of, type, y0, however, the, feature, is, difficult, to, distinguish, from, absorption, by, water, and, methane, and, other, authors, have, stated, that, the, assignment, of, class, y0, is, premature, the, first, jwst, spectral, energy, distribution, of, a, y, dwarf, was, able, to, observe, several, bands, of, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, of, the, y0, dwarf, wise, 0359, 5401, the, observations, covered, spectroscopy, from, 1, to, 12, m, and, photometry, at, 15, 18, and, 21, m, the, molecules, water, h, 2, o, methane, ch, 4, carbon, monoxide, co, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, ammonia, nh, 3, were, detected, in, wise, 0359, 5401, many, of, these, features, have, been, observed, before, in, this, y, dwarf, and, warmer, t, dwarfs, by, other, observatories, but, jwst, was, able, to, observe, them, in, a, single, spectrum, methane, is, the, main, reservoir, of, carbon, in, the, atmosphere, of, wise, 0359, 5401, but, there, is, still, enough, carbon, left, to, form, detectable, carbon, monoxide, at, 4, 5, 5, 0, m, and, carbon, dioxide, at, 4, 2, 4, 35, m, in, the, y, dwarf, ammonia, was, difficult, to, detect, before, jwst, as, it, blends, in, with, the, absorption, feature, of, water, in, the, near, infrared, as, well, at, 5, 5, 7, 1, m, at, longer, wavelengths, of, 8, 5, 12, m, the, spectrum, of, wise, 0359, 5401, is, dominated, by, the, absorption, of, ammonia, at, 3, m, there, is, an, additional, newly, detected, ammonia, feature, usually, brown, dwarfs, have, a, pressure, temperature, p, t, profile, in, an, adiabatic, form, which, means, that, the, pressure, and, temperature, increase, with, depth, jwst, spectroscopy, and, photometry, suggest, that, y, dwarfs, have, p, t, profiles, that, are, not, in, the, standard, adiabatic, form, this, means, that, upper, layers, of, the, atmosphere, have, a, warmer, temperature, and, lower, layers, of, the, atmosphere, have, a, colder, temperature, this, is, explained, with, the, rapid, rotation, of, these, isolated, objects, the, rapid, rotation, leads, to, dynamical, thermal, and, chemical, changes, which, disrupt, the, convective, transport, of, heat, from, the, lower, to, the, upper, atmosphere, this, different, p, t, profile, influences, the, shape, of, the, spectrum, and, influences, the, composition, of, carbon, and, nitrogen, bearing, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, of, y, dwarfs, timeline, of, y, dwarf, discoveries, in, the, hydrogen, dominated, atmosphere, of, brown, dwarfs, a, chemical, equilibrium, between, carbon, monoxide, and, methane, exists, carbon, monoxide, reacts, with, hydrogen, molecules, and, forms, methane, and, hydroxyl, in, this, reaction, the, hydroxyl, radical, might, later, react, with, hydrogen, and, form, water, molecules, in, the, other, direction, of, the, reaction, methane, reacts, with, hydroxyl, and, forms, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, the, chemical, reaction, is, tilted, towards, carbon, monoxide, at, higher, temperatures, l, dwarfs, and, lower, pressure, at, lower, temperatures, t, dwarfs, and, higher, pressure, the, reaction, is, tilted, towards, methane, and, methane, predominates, at, the, t, y, boundary, however, vertical, mixing, of, the, atmosphere, can, cause, methane, to, sink, into, lower, layers, of, the, atmosphere, and, carbon, monoxide, to, rise, from, these, lower, and, hotter, layers, the, carbon, monoxide, is, slow, to, react, back, into, methane, because, of, an, energy, barrier, that, prevents, the, breakdown, of, the, c, o, bonds, this, forces, the, observable, atmosphere, of, a, brown, dwarf, to, be, in, a, chemical, disequilibrium, the, l, t, transition, is, mainly, defined, with, the, transition, from, a, carbon, monoxide, dominated, atmosphere, in, l, dwarfs, to, a, methane, dominated, atmosphere, in, t, dwarfs, the, amount, of, vertical, mixing, can, therefore, push, the, l, t, transition, to, lower, or, higher, temperatures, this, becomes, important, for, objects, with, modest, surface, gravity, and, extended, atmospheres, such, as, giant, exoplanets, this, pushes, the, l, t, transition, to, lower, temperatures, for, giant, exoplanets, for, brown, dwarfs, this, transition, occurs, at, around, 1200, k, the, exoplanet, hr, 8799c, on, the, other, hand, does, not, show, any, methane, while, having, a, temperature, of, 1100k, the, transition, between, t, and, y, dwarfs, is, often, defined, as, 500, k, because, of, the, lack, of, spectral, observations, of, these, cold, and, faint, objects, future, observations, with, jwst, and, the, elts, might, improve, the, sample, of, y, dwarfs, with, observed, spectra, y, dwarfs, are, dominated, by, deep, spectral, features, of, methane, water, vapor, and, possibly, absorption, features, of, ammonia, and, water, ice, vertical, mixing, clouds, metallicity, photochemistry, lightning, impact, shocks, and, metallic, catalysts, might, influence, the, temperature, at, which, the, l, t, and, t, y, transition, occurs, young, brown, dwarfs, have, low, surface, gravities, because, they, have, larger, radii, and, lower, masses, than, the, field, stars, of, similar, spectral, type, these, sources, are, noted, by, a, letter, beta, for, intermediate, surface, gravity, or, gamma, for, low, surface, gravity, indicators, of, low, surface, gravity, include, weak, cah, k, i, and, na, i, lines, as, well, as, a, strong, vo, line, alpha, denotes, normal, surface, gravity, and, is, usually, dropped, sometimes, an, extremely, low, surface, gravity, is, denoted, by, a, delta, the, suffix, pec, stands, for, peculiar, this, suffix, is, still, used, for, other, features, that, are, unusual, and, summarizes, different, properties, indicating, low, surface, gravity, subdwarfs, and, unresolved, binaries, the, prefix, sd, stands, for, subdwarf, and, only, includes, cool, subdwarfs, this, prefix, indicates, a, low, metallicity, and, kinematic, properties, that, are, more, similar, to, halo, stars, than, to, disk, stars, subdwarfs, appear, bluer, than, disk, objects, the, red, suffix, describes, objects, with, red, color, but, an, older, age, this, is, not, interpreted, as, low, surface, gravity, but, as, a, high, dust, content, the, blue, suffix, describes, objects, with, blue, near, infrared, colors, that, cannot, be, explained, with, low, metallicity, some, are, explained, as, l, t, binaries, others, are, not, binaries, such, as, 2mass, j11263991, 5003550, and, are, explained, with, thin, and, or, large, grained, clouds, the, majority, of, flux, emitted, by, l, and, t, dwarfs, is, in, the, 1, to, 2, 5, micrometre, near, infrared, range, low, and, decreasing, temperatures, through, the, late, m, l, and, t, dwarf, sequence, result, in, a, rich, near, infrared, spectrum, containing, a, wide, variety, of, features, from, relatively, narrow, lines, of, neutral, atomic, species, to, broad, molecular, bands, all, of, which, have, different, dependencies, on, temperature, gravity, and, metallicity, furthermore, these, low, temperature, conditions, favor, condensation, out, of, the, gas, state, and, the, formation, of, grains, typical, atmospheres, of, known, brown, dwarfs, range, in, temperature, from, 2, 200, down, to, 750, k, compared, to, stars, which, warm, themselves, with, steady, internal, fusion, brown, dwarfs, cool, quickly, over, time, more, massive, dwarfs, cool, more, slowly, than, less, massive, ones, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, cooling, of, brown, dwarfs, slows, down, at, the, transition, between, spectral, classes, l, and, t, about, 1000, k, observations, of, known, brown, dwarf, candidates, have, revealed, a, pattern, of, brightening, and, dimming, of, infrared, emissions, that, suggests, relatively, cool, opaque, cloud, patterns, obscuring, a, hot, interior, that, is, stirred, by, extreme, winds, the, weather, on, such, bodies, is, thought, to, be, extremely, strong, comparable, to, but, far, exceeding, jupiter, s, famous, storms, on, january, 8, 2013, astronomers, using, nasa, s, hubble, and, spitzer, space, telescopes, probed, the, stormy, atmosphere, of, a, brown, dwarf, named, 2mass, j22282889, 4310262, creating, the, most, detailed, weather, map, of, a, brown, dwarf, thus, far, it, shows, wind, driven, planet, sized, clouds, the, new, research, is, a, stepping, stone, toward, a, better, understanding, not, only, brown, dwarfs, but, also, of, the, atmospheres, of, planets, beyond, the, solar, system, in, april, 2020, scientists, reported, clocking, wind, speeds, of, 650, 310, metres, per, second, up, to, 1, 450, miles, per, hour, on, the, nearby, brown, dwarf, 2mass, j10475385, 2124234, to, calculate, the, measurements, scientists, compared, the, rotational, movement, of, atmospheric, features, as, ascertained, by, brightness, changes, against, the, electromagnetic, rotation, generated, by, the, brown, dwarf, s, interior, the, results, confirmed, previous, predictions, that, brown, dwarfs, would, have, high, winds, scientists, are, hopeful, that, this, comparison, method, can, be, used, to, explore, the, atmospheric, dynamics, of, other, brown, dwarfs, and, extrasolar, planets, coronagraphs, have, recently, been, used, to, detect, faint, objects, orbiting, bright, visible, stars, including, gliese, 229b, sensitive, telescopes, equipped, with, charge, coupled, devices, ccds, have, been, used, to, search, distant, star, clusters, for, faint, objects, including, teide, 1, wide, field, searches, have, identified, individual, faint, objects, such, as, kelu, 1, 30, light, years, away, brown, dwarfs, are, often, discovered, in, surveys, to, discover, exoplanets, methods, of, detecting, exoplanets, work, for, brown, dwarfs, as, well, although, brown, dwarfs, are, much, easier, to, detect, brown, dwarfs, can, be, powerful, emitters, of, radio, emission, due, to, their, strong, magnetic, fields, observing, programs, at, the, arecibo, observatory, and, the, very, large, array, have, detected, over, a, dozen, such, objects, which, are, also, called, ultracool, dwarfs, because, they, share, common, magnetic, properties, with, other, objects, in, this, class, the, detection, of, radio, emission, from, brown, dwarfs, permits, their, magnetic, field, strengths, to, be, measured, directly, x, ray, flares, detected, from, brown, dwarfs, since, 1999, suggest, changing, magnetic, fields, within, them, similar, to, those, in, very, low, mass, stars, although, they, do, not, fuse, hydrogen, into, helium, in, their, cores, like, stars, energy, from, the, fusion, of, deuterium, and, gravitational, contraction, keep, their, interiors, warm, and, generate, strong, magnetic, fields, the, interior, of, a, brown, dwarf, is, in, a, rapidly, boiling, or, convective, state, when, combined, with, the, rapid, rotation, that, most, brown, dwarfs, exhibit, convection, sets, up, conditions, for, the, development, of, a, strong, tangled, magnetic, field, near, the, surface, the, magnetic, fields, that, generated, the, flare, observed, by, chandra, from, lp, 944, 20, has, its, origin, in, the, turbulent, magnetized, plasma, beneath, the, brown, dwarf, s, surface, using, nasa, s, chandra, x, ray, observatory, scientists, have, detected, x, rays, from, a, low, mass, brown, dwarf, in, a, multiple, star, system, this, is, the, first, time, that, a, brown, dwarf, this, close, to, its, parent, star, s, sun, like, stars, twa, 5a, has, been, resolved, in, x, rays, our, chandra, data, show, that, the, x, rays, originate, from, the, brown, dwarf, s, coronal, plasma, which, is, some, 3, million, degrees, celsius, said, yohko, tsuboi, of, chuo, university, in, tokyo, this, brown, dwarf, is, as, bright, as, the, sun, today, in, x, ray, light, while, it, is, fifty, times, less, massive, than, the, sun, said, tsuboi, this, observation, thus, raises, the, possibility, that, even, massive, planets, might, emit, x, rays, by, themselves, during, their, youth, the, first, brown, dwarf, that, was, discovered, to, emit, radio, signals, was, lp, 944, 20, which, was, observed, since, it, is, also, a, source, of, x, ray, emission, and, both, types, of, emission, are, signatures, of, coronae, approximately, 5, 10, of, brown, dwarfs, appear, to, have, strong, magnetic, fields, and, emit, radio, waves, and, there, may, be, as, many, as, 40, magnetic, brown, dwarfs, within, 25, pc, of, the, sun, based, on, monte, carlo, modeling, and, their, average, spatial, density, the, power, of, the, radio, emissions, of, brown, dwarfs, is, roughly, constant, despite, variations, in, their, temperatures, brown, dwarfs, may, maintain, magnetic, fields, of, up, to, 6, kg, in, strength, astronomers, have, estimated, brown, dwarf, magnetospheres, to, span, an, altitude, of, approximately, 10, 7, m, given, properties, of, their, radio, emissions, it, is, unknown, whether, the, radio, emissions, from, brown, dwarfs, more, closely, resemble, those, from, planets, or, stars, some, brown, dwarfs, emit, regular, radio, pulses, which, are, sometimes, interpreted, as, radio, emission, beamed, from, the, poles, but, may, also, be, beamed, from, active, regions, the, regular, periodic, reversal, of, radio, wave, orientation, may, indicate, that, brown, dwarf, magnetic, fields, periodically, reverse, polarity, these, reversals, may, be, the, result, of, a, brown, dwarf, magnetic, activity, cycle, similar, to, the, solar, cycle, the, first, brown, dwarf, of, spectral, class, m, found, to, emit, radio, waves, was, lp, 944, 20, detected, in, 2001, the, first, brown, dwarf, of, spectral, class, l, found, to, emit, radio, waves, was, 2mass, j0036159, 182110, detected, in, 2008, the, first, brown, dwarf, of, spectral, class, t, found, to, emit, radio, waves, was, 2mass, j10475385, 2124234, this, last, discovery, was, significant, since, it, revealed, that, brown, dwarfs, with, temperatures, similar, to, exoplanets, could, host, strong, 1, 7, kg, magnetic, fields, although, a, sensitive, search, for, radio, emission, from, y, dwarfs, was, conducted, at, the, arecibo, observatory, in, 2010, no, emission, was, detected, estimates, of, brown, dwarf, populations, in, the, solar, neighbourhood, suggest, that, there, may, be, as, many, as, six, stars, for, every, brown, dwarf, a, more, recent, estimate, from, 2017, using, the, young, massive, star, cluster, rcw, 38, concluded, that, the, milky, way, galaxy, contains, between, 25, and, 100, billion, brown, dwarfs, compare, these, numbers, to, the, estimates, of, the, number, of, stars, in, the, milky, way, 100, to, 400, billion, in, a, study, published, in, aug, 2017, nasa, s, spitzer, space, telescope, monitored, infrared, brightness, variations, in, brown, dwarfs, caused, by, cloud, cover, of, variable, thickness, the, observations, revealed, large, scale, waves, propagating, in, the, atmospheres, of, brown, dwarfs, similarly, to, the, atmosphere, of, neptune, and, other, solar, system, giant, planets, these, atmospheric, waves, modulate, the, thickness, of, the, clouds, and, propagate, with, different, velocities, probably, due, to, differential, rotation, in, august, 2020, astronomers, discovered, 95, brown, dwarfs, near, the, sun, through, the, project, backyard, worlds, planet, 9, in, 2024, the, james, webb, space, telescope, provided, the, most, detailed, weather, report, yet, on, two, brown, dwarfs, revealing, stormy, conditions, these, brown, dwarfs, part, of, a, binary, star, system, named, wise, 1049ab, discovered, in, 2013, are, only, 6, 5, light, years, away, from, earth, and, are, the, closest, brown, dwarfs, to, our, sun, researchers, discovered, that, they, have, turbulent, clouds, likely, made, of, silicate, grains, with, temperatures, ranging, from, 875, c, 1, 607, f, to, 1, 026, c, 1, 879, f, this, indicates, that, hot, sand, is, being, blown, by, winds, on, the, brown, dwarfs, additionally, absorption, signatures, of, carbon, monoxide, methane, and, water, vapor, were, detected, brown, dwarfs, binaries, of, type, m, l, and, t, are, less, common, with, a, lower, mass, of, the, primary, l, dwarfs, have, a, binary, fraction, of, about, 24, 6, 2, and, the, binary, fraction, for, late, t, early, y, dwarfs, t5, y0, is, about, 8, 6, brown, dwarf, binaries, have, a, higher, companion, to, host, ratio, q, m, b, m, a, displaystyle, q, m, b, m, a, for, lower, mass, binaries, binaries, with, a, m, type, star, as, a, primary, have, for, example, a, broad, distribution, of, q, with, a, preference, of, q, 0, 4, brown, dwarfs, on, the, other, hand, show, a, strong, preference, for, q, 0, 7, the, separation, is, decreasing, with, mass, m, type, stars, have, a, separation, peaking, at, 3, 30, astronomical, units, au, m, l, type, brown, dwarfs, have, a, projected, separation, peaking, at, 5, 8, au, and, t5, y0, objects, have, a, projected, separation, that, follows, a, lognormal, distribution, with, a, peak, separation, of, about, 2, 9, au, an, example, is, the, closest, brown, dwarf, binary, luhman, 16, ab, with, a, primary, l7, 5, dwarf, and, a, separation, of, 3, 5, au, and, q, 0, 85, the, separation, is, on, the, lower, end, of, the, expected, separation, for, m, l, type, brown, dwarfs, but, the, mass, ratio, is, typical, it, is, not, known, if, the, same, trend, continues, with, y, dwarfs, because, their, sample, size, is, so, small, the, y, y, dwarf, binaries, should, have, a, high, mass, ratio, q, and, a, low, separation, reaching, scales, of, less, than, one, au, the, y, y, dwarf, wise, j0336, 0143, was, recently, confirmed, as, a, binary, with, jwst, and, it, has, a, mass, ratio, of, q, 0, 62, 0, 05, and, a, separation, of, 0, 97, astronomical, units, the, researchers, point, out, that, the, sample, size, of, low, mass, binary, brown, dwarfs, is, too, small, to, determine, if, wise, j0336, 0143, is, a, typical, representative, of, low, mass, binaries, or, a, peculiar, system, observations, of, the, orbit, of, binary, systems, containing, brown, dwarfs, can, be, used, to, measure, the, mass, of, the, brown, dwarf, in, the, case, of, 2massw, j0746425, 2000321, the, secondary, weighs, 6, of, the, solar, mass, this, measurement, is, called, a, dynamical, mass, the, brown, dwarf, system, closest, to, the, solar, system, is, the, binary, luhman, 16, it, was, attempted, to, search, for, planets, around, this, system, with, a, similar, method, but, none, were, found, the, wide, binary, system, 2m1101ab, was, the, first, binary, with, a, separation, greater, than, 20, au, the, discovery, of, the, system, gave, definitive, insights, to, the, formation, of, brown, dwarfs, it, was, previously, thought, that, wide, binary, brown, dwarfs, are, not, formed, or, at, least, are, disrupted, at, ages, of, 1, 10, myr, the, existence, of, this, system, is, also, inconsistent, with, the, ejection, hypothesis, the, ejection, hypothesis, was, a, proposed, hypothesis, in, which, brown, dwarfs, form, in, a, multiple, system, but, are, ejected, before, they, gain, enough, mass, to, burn, hydrogen, more, recently, the, wide, binary, w2150ab, was, discovered, it, has, a, similar, mass, ratio, and, binding, energy, as, 2m1101ab, but, a, greater, age, and, is, located, in, a, different, region, of, the, galaxy, while, 2m1101ab, is, in, a, closely, crowded, region, the, binary, w2150ab, is, in, a, sparsely, separated, field, it, must, have, survived, any, dynamical, interactions, in, its, natal, star, cluster, the, binary, belongs, also, to, a, few, l, t, binaries, that, can, be, easily, resolved, by, ground, based, observatories, the, other, two, are, sdss, j1416, 13ab, and, luhman, 16, there, are, other, interesting, binary, systems, such, as, the, eclipsing, binary, brown, dwarf, system, 2mass, j05352184, 0546085, photometric, studies, of, this, system, have, revealed, that, the, less, massive, brown, dwarf, in, the, system, is, hotter, than, its, higher, mass, companion, brown, dwarfs, and, massive, planets, in, a, close, orbit, less, than, 5, au, around, stars, are, rare, and, this, is, sometimes, described, as, the, brown, dwarf, desert, less, than, 1, of, stars, with, the, mass, of, the, sun, have, a, brown, dwarf, within, 3, 5, au, an, example, for, a, star, brown, dwarf, binary, is, the, first, discovered, t, dwarf, gliese, 229, b, which, orbits, around, the, main, sequence, star, gliese, 229, a, a, red, dwarf, brown, dwarfs, orbiting, subgiants, are, also, known, such, as, toi, 1994b, which, orbits, its, star, every, 4, 03, days, there, is, also, disagreement, if, some, low, mass, brown, dwarfs, should, be, considered, planets, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, includes, brown, dwarfs, with, a, minimum, mass, less, or, equal, to, 30, jupiter, masses, as, planets, as, long, as, there, are, other, criteria, fulfilled, e, g, orbiting, a, star, the, working, group, on, extrasolar, planets, wgesp, of, the, iau, on, the, other, hand, only, considers, planets, with, a, mass, below, 13, jupiter, masses, brown, dwarfs, around, white, dwarfs, are, quite, rare, gd, 165, b, the, prototype, of, the, l, dwarfs, is, one, such, system, such, systems, can, be, useful, in, determining, the, age, of, the, system, and, the, mass, of, the, brown, dwarf, other, white, dwarf, brown, dwarf, binaries, are, coconuts, 1, ab, 7, billion, years, old, and, lspm, j0055, 5948, ab, 10, billion, years, old, sdss, j22255, 0016, ab, 2, billion, years, old, wd, 0806, 661, ab, 1, 5, 2, 7, billion, years, old, systems, with, close, tidally, locked, brown, dwarfs, orbiting, around, white, dwarfs, belong, to, the, post, common, envelope, binaries, or, pcebs, only, eight, confirmed, pcebs, containing, a, white, dwarf, with, a, brown, dwarf, companion, are, known, including, wd, 0137, 349, ab, in, the, past, history, of, these, close, white, dwarf, brown, dwarf, binaries, the, brown, dwarf, is, engulfed, by, the, star, in, the, red, giant, phase, brown, dwarfs, with, a, mass, lower, than, 20, jupiter, masses, would, evaporate, during, the, engulfment, the, dearth, of, brown, dwarfs, orbiting, close, to, white, dwarfs, can, be, compared, with, similar, observations, of, brown, dwarfs, around, main, sequence, stars, described, as, the, brown, dwarf, desert, the, pceb, might, evolve, into, a, cataclysmic, variable, star, cv, with, the, brown, dwarf, as, the, donor, simulations, have, shown, that, highly, evolved, cv, are, mostly, associated, with, substellar, donors, up, to, 80, a, type, of, cv, called, wz, sge, type, dwarf, nova, often, show, donors, with, a, mass, near, the, borderline, of, low, mass, stars, and, brown, dwarfs, the, binary, bw, sculptoris, is, such, a, dwarf, nova, with, a, brown, dwarf, donor, this, brown, dwarf, likely, formed, when, a, donor, star, lost, enough, mass, to, become, a, brown, dwarf, the, mass, loss, comes, with, a, loss, of, the, orbital, period, until, it, reaches, a, minimum, of, 70, 80, minutes, at, which, the, period, increases, again, this, gives, this, evolutionary, stage, the, name, period, bouncer, there, could, also, exist, brown, dwarfs, that, merged, with, white, dwarfs, the, nova, ck, vulpeculae, might, be, a, result, of, such, a, white, dwarf, brown, dwarf, merger, brown, dwarfs, form, similarly, to, stars, and, are, surrounded, by, protoplanetary, disks, such, as, cha, 110913, 773444, as, of, 2017, there, is, only, one, known, proto, brown, dwarf, that, is, connected, with, a, large, herbig, haro, object, this, is, the, brown, dwarf, mayrit, 1701117, which, is, surrounded, by, a, pseudo, disk, and, a, keplerian, disk, mayrit, 1701117, launches, the, 0, 7, light, year, long, jet, hh, 1165, mostly, seen, in, ionized, sulfur, disks, around, brown, dwarfs, have, been, found, to, have, many, of, the, same, features, as, disks, around, stars, therefore, it, is, expected, that, there, will, be, accretion, formed, planets, around, brown, dwarfs, given, the, small, mass, of, brown, dwarf, disks, most, planets, will, be, terrestrial, planets, rather, than, gas, giants, if, a, giant, planet, orbits, a, brown, dwarf, across, our, line, of, sight, then, because, they, have, approximately, the, same, diameter, this, would, give, a, large, signal, for, detection, by, transit, the, accretion, zone, for, planets, around, a, brown, dwarf, is, very, close, to, the, brown, dwarf, itself, so, tidal, forces, would, have, a, strong, effect, in, 2020, the, closest, brown, dwarf, with, an, associated, primordial, disk, wisea, j120037, 79, 784508, 3, w1200, 7845, was, discovered, by, the, disk, detective, project, when, classification, volunteers, noted, its, infrared, excess, it, was, vetted, and, analyzed, by, the, science, team, who, found, that, w1200, 7845, had, a, 99, 8, probability, of, being, a, member, of, the, chamaeleontis, cha, young, moving, group, association, its, parallax, using, gaia, dr2, data, puts, it, at, a, distance, of, 102, parsecs, or, 333, lightyears, from, earth, which, is, within, the, local, solar, neighborhood, a, paper, from, 2021, studied, circumstellar, discs, around, brown, dwarfs, in, stellar, associations, that, are, a, few, million, years, old, and, 140, to, 200, parsecs, away, the, researchers, found, that, these, disks, are, not, massive, enough, to, form, planets, in, the, future, there, is, evidence, in, these, disks, that, might, indicate, that, planet, formation, begins, at, earlier, stages, and, that, planets, are, already, present, in, these, disks, the, evidence, for, disk, evolution, includes, a, decreasing, disk, mass, over, time, dust, grain, growth, and, dust, settling, disks, around, brown, dwarfs, usually, have, a, radius, smaller, than, 40, astronomical, units, but, three, disks, in, the, more, distant, taurus, molecular, cloud, have, a, radius, larger, than, 70, au, and, were, resolved, with, alma, these, larger, disks, are, able, to, form, rocky, planets, with, a, mass, 1, m, e, there, are, also, brown, dwarfs, with, disks, in, associations, older, than, a, few, million, years, which, might, be, evidence, that, disks, around, brown, dwarfs, need, more, time, to, dissipate, especially, old, disks, 20, myrs, are, sometimes, called, peter, pan, disks, currently, 2mass, j02265658, 5327032, is, the, only, known, brown, dwarf, that, has, a, peter, pan, disk, the, brown, dwarf, cha, 110913, 773444, located, 500, light, years, away, in, the, constellation, chamaeleon, may, be, in, the, process, of, forming, a, miniature, planetary, system, astronomers, from, pennsylvania, state, university, have, detected, what, they, believe, to, be, a, disk, of, gas, and, dust, similar, to, the, one, hypothesized, to, have, formed, the, solar, system, cha, 110913, 773444, is, the, smallest, brown, dwarf, found, to, date, 8, m, j, and, if, it, formed, a, planetary, system, it, would, be, the, smallest, known, object, to, have, one, according, to, the, iau, working, definition, from, august, 2018, an, exoplanet, can, orbit, a, brown, dwarf, it, requires, a, mass, below, 13, m, j, and, a, mass, ratio, of, m, m, central, 2, 25, 621, this, means, that, an, object, with, a, mass, up, to, 3, 2, m, j, around, a, brown, dwarf, with, a, mass, of, 80, m, j, is, considered, a, planet, it, also, means, that, an, object, with, a, mass, up, to, 0, 52, m, j, around, a, brown, dwarf, with, a, mass, of, 13, m, j, is, considered, a, planet, the, super, jupiter, planetary, mass, objects, 2m1207b, 2mass, j044144, and, oph, 98, b, that, are, orbiting, brown, dwarfs, at, large, orbital, distances, may, have, formed, by, cloud, collapse, rather, than, accretion, and, so, may, be, sub, brown, dwarfs, rather, than, planets, which, is, inferred, from, relatively, large, masses, and, large, orbits, the, first, discovery, of, a, low, mass, companion, orbiting, a, brown, dwarf, chah, 8, at, a, small, orbital, distance, using, the, radial, velocity, technique, paved, the, way, for, the, detection, of, planets, around, brown, dwarfs, on, orbits, of, a, few, au, or, smaller, however, with, a, mass, ratio, between, the, companion, and, primary, in, chah, 8, of, about, 0, 3, this, system, rather, resembles, a, binary, star, then, in, 2008, the, first, planetary, mass, companion, in, a, relatively, small, orbit, moa, 2007, blg, 192lb, was, discovered, orbiting, a, brown, dwarf, planets, around, brown, dwarfs, are, likely, to, be, carbon, planets, depleted, of, water, a, 2017, study, based, upon, observations, with, spitzer, estimates, that, 175, brown, dwarfs, need, to, be, monitored, in, order, to, guarantee, 95, at, least, one, detection, of, a, below, earth, sized, planet, via, the, transiting, method, jwst, could, potentially, detect, smaller, planets, the, orbits, of, planets, and, moons, in, the, solar, system, often, align, with, the, orientation, of, the, host, star, planet, they, orbit, assuming, the, orbit, of, a, planet, is, aligned, with, the, rotational, axis, of, a, brown, dwarf, or, planetary, mass, object, the, geometric, transit, probability, of, an, object, similar, to, io, can, be, calculated, with, the, formula, cos, 79, 5, cos, inclination, the, inclination, was, estimated, for, several, brown, dwarfs, and, planetary, mass, objects, simp, 0136, for, example, has, an, estimated, inclination, of, 80, 12, assuming, the, lower, bound, of, i, 68, for, simp, 0136, this, results, in, a, transit, probability, of, 48, 6, for, close, in, planets, it, is, however, not, known, how, common, close, in, planets, are, around, brown, dwarfs, and, they, might, be, more, common, for, lower, mass, objects, as, disk, sizes, seem, to, decrease, with, mass, habitability, for, hypothetical, planets, orbiting, brown, dwarfs, has, been, studied, computer, models, suggesting, conditions, for, these, bodies, to, have, habitable, planets, are, very, stringent, the, habitable, zone, being, narrow, close, t, dwarf, 0, 005, au, and, decreasing, with, time, due, to, the, cooling, of, the, brown, dwarf, they, fuse, for, at, most, 10, million, years, the, orbits, there, would, have, to, be, of, extremely, low, eccentricity, on, the, order, of, 10, to, the, minus, 6, to, avoid, strong, tidal, forces, that, would, trigger, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, on, the, planets, rendering, them, uninhabitable, there, would, also, be, no, moons, in, 1984, it, was, postulated, by, some, astronomers, that, the, sun, may, be, orbited, by, an, undetected, brown, dwarf, sometimes, referred, to, as, nemesis, that, could, interact, with, the, oort, cloud, just, as, passing, stars, can, however, this, hypothesis, has, fallen, out, of, favor,
