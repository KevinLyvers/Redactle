orion, is, a, prominent, set, of, stars, visible, during, winter, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, it, is, one, of, the, 88, modern, constellations, it, was, among, the, 48, constellations, listed, by, the, 2nd, century, astronomer, ptolemy, it, is, named, after, a, hunter, in, greek, mythology, orion, is, most, prominent, during, winter, evenings, in, the, northern, hemisphere, as, are, five, other, constellations, that, have, stars, in, the, winter, hexagon, asterism, orion, s, two, brightest, stars, rigel, and, betelgeuse, are, both, among, the, brightest, stars, in, the, night, sky, both, are, supergiants, and, slightly, variable, there, are, a, further, six, stars, brighter, than, magnitude, 3, 0, including, three, making, the, short, straight, line, of, the, orion, s, belt, asterism, orion, also, hosts, the, radiant, of, the, annual, orionids, the, strongest, meteor, shower, associated, with, halley, s, comet, and, the, orion, nebula, one, of, the, brightest, nebulae, in, the, sky, orion, is, bordered, by, taurus, to, the, northwest, eridanus, to, the, southwest, lepus, to, the, south, monoceros, to, the, east, and, gemini, to, the, northeast, covering, 594, square, degrees, orion, ranks, twenty, sixth, of, the, 88, constellations, in, size, the, constellation, boundaries, as, set, by, belgian, astronomer, eug, ne, delporte, in, 1930, are, defined, by, a, polygon, of, 26, sides, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, right, ascension, coordinates, of, these, borders, lie, between, 04, h, 43, 3, m, and, 06, h, 25, 5, m, while, the, declination, coordinates, are, between, 22, 87, and, 10, 97, the, constellation, s, three, letter, abbreviation, as, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, in, 1922, is, ori, orion, is, most, visible, in, the, evening, sky, from, january, to, april, winter, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, summer, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, the, tropics, less, than, about, 8, from, the, equator, the, constellation, transits, at, the, zenith, in, the, period, may, july, summer, in, the, northern, hemisphere, winter, in, the, southern, hemisphere, orion, is, in, the, daytime, sky, and, thus, invisible, at, most, latitudes, however, for, much, of, antarctica, in, the, southern, hemisphere, s, winter, months, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, even, at, midday, stars, and, thus, orion, but, only, the, brightest, stars, are, then, visible, at, twilight, for, a, few, hours, around, local, noon, just, in, the, brightest, section, of, the, sky, low, in, the, north, where, the, sun, is, just, below, the, horizon, at, the, same, time, of, day, at, the, south, pole, itself, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, rigel, is, only, 8, above, the, horizon, and, the, belt, sweeps, just, along, it, in, the, southern, hemisphere, s, summer, months, when, orion, is, normally, visible, in, the, night, sky, the, constellation, is, actually, not, visible, in, antarctica, because, the, sun, does, not, set, at, that, time, of, year, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, in, countries, close, to, the, equator, e, g, kenya, indonesia, colombia, ecuador, orion, appears, overhead, in, december, around, midnight, and, in, the, february, evening, sky, orion, is, very, useful, as, an, aid, to, locating, other, stars, by, extending, the, line, of, the, belt, southeastward, sirius, cma, can, be, found, northwestward, aldebaran, tau, a, line, eastward, across, the, two, shoulders, indicates, the, direction, of, procyon, cmi, a, line, from, rigel, through, betelgeuse, points, to, castor, and, pollux, gem, and, gem, additionally, rigel, is, part, of, the, winter, circle, asterism, sirius, and, procyon, which, may, be, located, from, orion, by, following, imaginary, lines, see, map, also, are, points, in, both, the, winter, triangle, and, the, circle, orion, s, seven, brightest, stars, form, a, distinctive, hourglass, shaped, asterism, or, pattern, in, the, night, sky, four, stars, rigel, betelgeuse, bellatrix, and, saiph, form, a, large, roughly, rectangular, shape, at, the, center, of, which, lies, the, three, stars, of, orion, s, belt, alnitak, alnilam, and, mintaka, his, head, is, marked, by, an, additional, 8th, star, called, meissa, which, is, fairly, bright, to, the, observer, descending, from, the, belt, is, a, smaller, line, of, three, stars, orion, s, sword, the, middle, of, which, is, in, fact, not, a, star, but, the, orion, nebula, also, known, as, the, hunter, s, sword, many, of, the, stars, are, luminous, hot, blue, supergiants, with, the, stars, of, the, belt, and, sword, forming, the, orion, ob1, association, standing, out, by, its, red, hue, betelgeuse, may, nevertheless, be, a, runaway, member, of, the, same, group, orion, s, belt, or, the, belt, of, orion, is, an, asterism, within, the, constellation, it, consists, of, the, three, bright, stars, zeta, alnitak, epsilon, alnilam, and, delta, mintaka, alnitak, is, around, 800, light, years, away, from, earth, and, is, 100, 000, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, and, shines, with, magnitude, 1, 8, much, of, its, radiation, is, in, the, ultraviolet, range, which, the, human, eye, cannot, see, alnilam, is, approximately, 2, 000, light, years, away, from, earth, shines, with, magnitude, 1, 70, and, with, ultraviolet, light, is, 375, 000, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, mintaka, is, 915, light, years, away, and, shines, with, magnitude, 2, 21, it, is, 90, 000, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, and, is, a, double, star, the, two, orbit, each, other, every, 5, 73, days, in, the, northern, hemisphere, orion, s, belt, is, best, visible, in, the, night, sky, during, the, month, of, january, around, 9, 00, pm, when, it, is, approximately, around, the, local, meridian, just, southwest, of, alnitak, lies, sigma, orionis, a, multiple, star, system, composed, of, five, stars, that, have, a, combined, apparent, magnitude, of, 3, 7, and, lying, 1150, light, years, distant, southwest, of, mintaka, lies, the, quadruple, star, eta, orionis, orion, s, sword, contains, the, orion, nebula, the, messier, 43, nebula, the, running, man, nebula, and, the, stars, theta, orionis, iota, orionis, and, 42, orionis, three, stars, comprise, a, small, triangle, that, marks, the, head, the, apex, is, marked, by, meissa, lambda, orionis, a, hot, blue, giant, of, spectral, type, o8, iii, and, apparent, magnitude, 3, 54, which, lies, some, 1100, light, years, distant, phi, 1, and, phi, 2, orionis, make, up, the, base, also, nearby, is, the, very, young, star, fu, orionis, stretching, north, from, betelgeuse, are, the, stars, that, make, up, orion, s, club, mu, orionis, marks, the, elbow, nu, and, xi, mark, the, handle, of, the, club, and, chi, 1, and, chi, 2, mark, the, end, of, the, club, just, east, of, chi, 1, is, the, mira, type, variable, red, giant, u, orionis, west, from, bellatrix, lie, six, stars, all, designated, pi, orionis, 1, ori, 2, ori, 3, ori, 4, ori, 5, ori, and, 6, ori, which, make, up, orion, s, shield, around, 20, october, each, year, the, orionid, meteor, shower, orionids, reaches, its, peak, coming, from, the, border, with, the, constellation, gemini, as, many, as, 20, meteors, per, hour, can, be, seen, the, shower, s, parent, body, is, halley, s, comet, hanging, from, orion, s, belt, is, his, sword, consisting, of, the, multiple, stars, 1, and, 2, orionis, called, the, trapezium, and, the, orion, nebula, m42, this, is, a, spectacular, object, that, can, be, clearly, identified, with, the, naked, eye, as, something, other, than, a, star, using, binoculars, its, clouds, of, nascent, stars, luminous, gas, and, dust, can, be, observed, the, trapezium, cluster, has, many, newborn, stars, including, several, brown, dwarfs, all, of, which, are, at, an, approximate, distance, of, 1, 500, light, years, named, for, the, four, bright, stars, that, form, a, trapezoid, it, is, largely, illuminated, by, the, brightest, stars, which, are, only, a, few, hundred, thousand, years, old, observations, by, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, show, both, the, extreme, temperatures, of, the, main, stars, up, to, 60, 000, kelvins, and, the, star, forming, regions, still, extant, in, the, surrounding, nebula, m78, ngc, 2068, is, a, nebula, in, orion, with, an, overall, magnitude, of, 8, 0, it, is, significantly, dimmer, than, the, great, orion, nebula, that, lies, to, its, south, however, it, is, at, approximately, the, same, distance, at, 1600, light, years, from, earth, it, can, easily, be, mistaken, for, a, comet, in, the, eyepiece, of, a, telescope, m78, is, associated, with, the, variable, star, v351, orionis, whose, magnitude, changes, are, visible, in, very, short, periods, of, time, another, fairly, bright, nebula, in, orion, is, ngc, 1999, also, close, to, the, great, orion, nebula, it, has, an, integrated, magnitude, of, 10, 5, and, is, 1500, light, years, from, earth, the, variable, star, v380, orionis, is, embedded, in, ngc, 1999, another, famous, nebula, is, ic, 434, the, horsehead, nebula, near, orionis, it, contains, a, dark, dust, cloud, whose, shape, gives, the, nebula, its, name, ngc, 2174, is, an, emission, nebula, located, 6400, light, years, from, earth, besides, these, nebulae, surveying, orion, with, a, small, telescope, will, reveal, a, wealth, of, interesting, deep, sky, objects, including, m43, m78, as, well, as, multiple, stars, including, iota, orionis, and, sigma, orionis, a, larger, telescope, may, reveal, objects, such, as, the, flame, nebula, ngc, 2024, as, well, as, fainter, and, tighter, multiple, stars, and, nebulae, barnard, s, loop, can, be, seen, on, very, dark, nights, or, using, long, exposure, photography, all, of, these, nebulae, are, part, of, the, larger, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, which, is, located, approximately, 1, 500, light, years, away, and, is, hundreds, of, light, years, across, it, is, one, of, the, most, intense, regions, of, stellar, formation, visible, within, our, galaxy, the, distinctive, pattern, of, orion, is, recognized, in, numerous, cultures, around, the, world, and, many, myths, are, associated, with, it, orion, is, used, as, a, symbol, in, the, modern, world, the, babylonian, star, catalogues, of, the, late, bronze, age, name, orion, mul, sipa, zi, an, na, the, heavenly, shepherd, or, true, shepherd, of, anu, anu, being, the, chief, god, of, the, heavenly, realms, the, babylonian, constellation, is, sacred, to, papshukal, and, ninshubur, both, minor, gods, fulfilling, the, role, of, messenger, to, the, gods, papshukal, is, closely, associated, with, the, figure, of, a, walking, bird, on, babylonian, boundary, stones, and, on, the, star, map, the, figure, of, the, rooster, is, located, below, and, behind, the, figure, of, the, true, shepherd, both, constellations, represent, the, herald, of, the, gods, in, his, bird, and, human, forms, respectively, in, ancient, egypt, the, stars, of, orion, were, regarded, as, a, god, called, sah, because, orion, rises, before, sirius, the, star, whose, heliacal, rising, was, the, basis, for, the, solar, egyptian, calendar, sah, was, closely, linked, with, sopdet, the, goddess, who, personified, sirius, the, god, sopdu, is, said, to, be, the, son, of, sah, and, sopdet, sah, is, syncretized, with, osiris, while, sopdet, is, syncretized, with, osiris, mythological, wife, isis, in, the, pyramid, texts, from, the, 24th, and, 23rd, centuries, bc, sah, is, one, of, many, gods, whose, form, the, dead, pharaoh, is, said, to, take, in, the, afterlife, the, armenians, identified, their, legendary, patriarch, and, founder, hayk, with, orion, hayk, is, also, the, name, of, the, orion, constellation, in, the, armenian, translation, of, the, bible, the, bible, mentions, orion, three, times, naming, it, kesil, literally, fool, though, this, name, perhaps, is, etymologically, connected, with, kislev, the, name, for, the, ninth, month, of, the, hebrew, calendar, i, e, november, december, which, in, turn, may, derive, from, the, hebrew, root, k, s, l, as, in, the, words, kesel, kisla, hope, positiveness,

angry, goddess, tried, to, dispatch, orion, with, a, scorpion, this, is, given, as, the, reason, that, the, constellations, of, scorpius, and, orion, are, never, in, the, sky, at, the, same, time, however, ophiuchus, the, serpent, bearer, revived, orion, with, an, antidote, this, is, said, to, be, the, reason, that, the, constellation, of, ophiuchus, stands, midway, between, the, scorpion, and, the, hunter, in, the, sky, the, constellation, is, mentioned, in, horace, s, odes, ode, 3, 27, 18, homer, s, odyssey, book, 5, line, 283, and, iliad, and, virgil, s, aeneid, book, 1, line, 535, in,

saucepan, or, pot, in, australia, and, new, zealand, orion, s, belt, is, called, drie, konings, three, kings, or, the, drie, susters, three, sisters, by, afrikaans, speakers, in, south, africa, and, are, referred, to, as, les, trois, rois, the, three, kings, in, daudet, s, lettres, de, mon, moulin, 1866, the, appellation, driekoningen, the, three, kings, is, also, often, found, in, 17th, and, 18th, century, dutch, star, charts, and, seaman, s, guides, the, same, three, stars, are, known, in, spain, latin, america, and, the, philippines, as, las, tres, mar, as, the, three, marys, and, as, los, tres, reyes, magos, the, three, wise, men, in, puerto, rico, even, traditional, depictions, of, orion, have, varied, greatly, cicero, drew, orion, in, a, similar, fashion, to, the, modern, depiction, the, hunter, held, an, unidentified, animal, skin, aloft, in, his, right, hand, his, hand, was, represented, by, omicron, 2, orionis, and, the, skin, was, represented, by, the, 5, stars, designated, pi, orionis, kappa, and, beta, orionis, represented, his, left, and, right, knees, while, eta, and, lambda, leporis, were, his, left, and, right, feet, respectively, as, in, the, modern, depiction, delta, epsilon, and, zeta, represented, his, belt, his, left, shoulder, was, represented, by, alpha, orionis, and, mu, orionis, made, up, his, left, arm, lambda, orionis, was, his, head, and, gamma, his, right, shoulder, the, depiction, of, hyginus, was, similar, to, that, of, cicero, though, the, two, differed, in, a, few, important, areas, cicero, s, animal, skin, became, hyginus, s, shield, omicron, and, pi, orionis, and, instead, of, an, arm, marked, out, by, mu, orionis, he, holds, a, club, chi, orionis, his, right, leg, is, represented, by, theta, orionis, and, his, left, leg, is, represented, by, lambda, mu, and, epsilon, leporis, further, western, european, and, arabic, depictions, have, followed, these, two, models, orion, is, located, on, the, celestial, equator, but, it, will, not, always, be, so, located, due, to, the, effects, of, precession, of, the, earth, s, axis, orion, lies, well, south, of, the, ecliptic, and, it, only, happens, to, lie, on, the, celestial, equator, because, the, point, on, the, ecliptic, that, corresponds, to, the, june, solstice, is, close, to, the, border, of, gemini, and, taurus, to, the, north, of, orion, precession, will, eventually, carry, orion, further, south, and, by, ad, 14000, orion, will, be, far, enough, south, that, it, will, no, longer, be, visible, from, the, latitude, of, great, britain, further, in, the, future, orion, s, stars, will, gradually, move, away, from, the, constellation, due, to, proper, motion, however, orion, s, brightest, stars, all, lie, at, a, large, distance, from, the, earth, on, an, astronomical, scale, much, farther, away, than, sirius, for, example, orion, will, still, be, recognizable, long, after, most, of, the, other, constellations, composed, of, relatively, nearby, stars, have, distorted, into, new, configurations, with, the, exception, of, a, few, of, its, stars, eventually, exploding, as, supernovae, for, example, betelgeuse, which, is, predicted, to, explode, sometime, in, the, next, million, years
