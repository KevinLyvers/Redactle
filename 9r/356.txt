sodium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, na, from, neo, latin, natrium, and, atomic, number, 11, it, is, a, soft, silvery, white, highly, reactive, metal, sodium, is, an, alkali, metal, being, in, group, 1, of, the, periodic, table, its, only, stable, isotope, is, 23, na, the, free, metal, does, not, occur, in, nature, and, must, be, prepared, from, compounds, sodium, is, the, sixth, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, exists, in, numerous, minerals, such, as, feldspars, sodalite, and, halite, nacl, many, salts, of, sodium, are, highly, water, soluble, sodium, ions, have, been, leached, by, the, action, of, water, from, the, earth, s, minerals, over, eons, and, thus, sodium, and, chlorine, are, the, most, common, dissolved, elements, by, weight, in, the, oceans, sodium, was, first, isolated, by, humphry, davy, in, 1807, by, the, electrolysis, of, sodium, hydroxide, among, many, other, useful, sodium, compounds, sodium, hydroxide, lye, is, used, in, soap, manufacture, and, sodium, chloride, edible, salt, is, a, de, icing, agent, and, a, nutrient, for, animals, including, humans, sodium, is, an, essential, element, for, all, animals, and, some, plants, sodium, ions, are, the, major, cation, in, the, extracellular, fluid, ecf, and, as, such, are, the, major, contributor, to, the, ecf, osmotic, pressure, animal, cells, actively, pump, sodium, ions, out, of, the, cells, by, means, of, the, sodium, potassium, pump, an, enzyme, complex, embedded, in, the, cell, membrane, in, order, to, maintain, a, roughly, ten, times, higher, concentration, of, sodium, ions, outside, the, cell, than, inside, in, nerve, cells, the, sudden, flow, of, sodium, ions, into, the, cell, through, voltage, gated, sodium, channels, enables, transmission, of, a, nerve, impulse, in, a, process, called, the, action, potential, sodium, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, is, a, soft, silvery, metal, that, combines, with, oxygen, in, the, air, forming, sodium, oxides, bulk, sodium, is, usually, stored, in, oil, or, an, inert, gas, sodium, metal, can, be, easily, cut, with, a, knife, it, is, a, good, conductor, of, electricity, and, heat, due, to, having, low, atomic, mass, and, large, atomic, radius, sodium, is, third, least, dense, of, all, elemental, metals, and, is, one, of, only, three, metals, that, can, float, on, water, the, other, two, being, lithium, and, potassium, the, melting, 98, c, and, boiling, 883, c, points, of, sodium, are, lower, than, those, of, lithium, but, higher, than, those, of, the, heavier, alkali, metals, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, following, periodic, trends, down, the, group, these, properties, change, dramatically, at, elevated, pressures, at, 1, 5, mbar, the, color, changes, from, silvery, metallic, to, black, at, 1, 9, mbar, the, material, becomes, transparent, with, a, red, color, and, at, 3, mbar, sodium, is, a, clear, and, transparent, solid, all, of, these, high, pressure, allotropes, are, insulators, and, electrides, in, a, flame, test, sodium, and, its, compounds, glow, yellow, because, the, excited, 3s, electrons, of, sodium, emit, a, photon, when, they, fall, from, 3p, to, 3s, the, wavelength, of, this, photon, corresponds, to, the, d, line, at, about, 589, 3, nm, spin, orbit, interactions, involving, the, electron, in, the, 3p, orbital, split, the, d, line, into, two, at, 589, 0, and, 589, 6, nm, hyperfine, structures, involving, both, orbitals, cause, many, more, lines, twenty, isotopes, of, sodium, are, known, but, only, 23, na, is, stable, 23, na, is, created, in, the, carbon, burning, process, in, stars, by, fusing, two, carbon, atoms, together, this, requires, temperatures, above, 600, megakelvins, and, a, star, of, at, least, three, solar, masses, two, radioactive, cosmogenic, isotopes, are, the, byproduct, of, cosmic, ray, spallation, 22, na, has, a, half, life, of, 2, 6, years, and, 24, na, a, half, life, of, 15, hours, all, other, isotopes, have, a, half, life, of, less, than, one, minute, two, nuclear, isomers, have, been, discovered, the, longer, lived, one, being, 24m, na, with, a, half, life, of, around, 20, 2, milliseconds, acute, neutron, radiation, as, from, a, nuclear, criticality, accident, converts, some, of, the, stable, 23, na, in, human, blood, to, 24, na, the, neutron, radiation, dosage, of, a, victim, can, be, calculated, by, measuring, the, concentration, of, 24, na, relative, to, 23, na, sodium, atoms, have, 11, electrons, one, more, than, the, stable, configuration, of, the, noble, gas, neon, the, first, and, second, ionization, energies, are, 495, 8, kj, mol, and, 4562, kj, mol, respectively, as, a, result, sodium, usually, forms, ionic, compounds, involving, the, na, cation, metallic, sodium, is, generally, less, reactive, than, potassium, and, more, reactive, than, lithium, sodium, metal, is, highly, reducing, with, the, standard, reduction, potential, for, the, na, na, couple, being, 2, 71, volts, though, potassium, and, lithium, have, even, more, negative, potentials, sodium, compounds, are, of, immense, commercial, importance, being, particularly, central, to, industries, producing, glass, paper, soap, and, textiles, the, most, important, sodium, compounds, are, table, salt, na, cl, soda, ash, na, 2, co, 3, baking, soda, na, hco, 3, caustic, soda, naoh, sodium, nitrate, na, no, 3, di, and, tri, sodium, phosphates, sodium, thiosulfate, na, 2, s, 2, o, 3, 5h, 2, o, and, borax, na, 2, b, 4, o, 7, 10h, 2, o, in, compounds, sodium, is, usually, ionically, bonded, to, water, and, anions, and, is, viewed, as, a, hard, lewis, acid, most, soaps, are, sodium, salts, of, fatty, acids, sodium, soaps, have, a, higher, melting, temperature, and, seem, harder, than, potassium, soaps, like, all, the, alkali, metals, sodium, reacts, exothermically, with, water, the, reaction, produces, caustic, soda, sodium, hydroxide, and, flammable, hydrogen, gas, when, burned, in, air, it, forms, primarily, sodium, peroxide, with, some, sodium, oxide, sodium, tends, to, form, water, soluble, compounds, such, as, halides, sulfates, nitrates, carboxylates, and, carbonates, the, main, aqueous, species, are, the, aquo, complexes, where, n, 4, 8, with, n, 6, indicated, from, x, ray, diffraction, data, and, computer, simulations, direct, precipitation, of, sodium, salts, from, aqueous, solutions, is, rare, because, sodium, salts, typically, have, a, high, affinity, for, water, an, exception, is, sodium, bismuthate, nabio, 3, which, is, insoluble, in, cold, water, and, decomposes, in, hot, water, because, of, the, high, solubility, of, its, compounds, sodium, salts, are, usually, isolated, as, solids, by, evaporation, or, by, precipitation, with, an, organic, antisolvent, such, as, ethanol, for, example, only, 0, 35, g, l, of, sodium, chloride, will, dissolve, in, ethanol, crown, ethers, like, 15, crown, 5, may, be, used, as, a, phase, transfer, catalyst, sodium, content, of, samples, is, determined, by, atomic, absorption, spectrophotometry, or, by, potentiometry, using, ion, selective, electrodes, like, the, other, alkali, metals, sodium, dissolves, in, ammonia, and, some, amines, to, give, deeply, colored, solutions, evaporation, of, these, solutions, leaves, a, shiny, film, of, metallic, sodium, the, solutions, contain, the, coordination, complex, with, the, positive, charge, counterbalanced, by, electrons, as, anions, cryptands, permit, the, isolation, of, these, complexes, as, crystalline, solids, sodium, forms, complexes, with, crown, ethers, cryptands, and, other, ligands, for, example, 15, crown, 5, has, a, high, affinity, for, sodium, because, the, cavity, size, of, 15, crown, 5, is, 1, 7, 2, 2, which, is, enough, to, fit, the, sodium, ion, 1, 9, cryptands, like, crown, ethers, and, other, ionophores, also, have, a, high, affinity, for, the, sodium, ion, derivatives, of, the, alkalide, na, are, obtainable, by, the, addition, of, cryptands, to, solutions, of, sodium, in, ammonia, via, disproportionation, many, organosodium, compounds, have, been, prepared, because, of, the, high, polarity, of, the, c, na, bonds, they, behave, like, sources, of, carbanions, salts, with, organic, anions, some, well, known, derivatives, include, sodium, cyclopentadienide, nac, 5, h, 5, and, trityl, sodium, c, 6, h, 5, 3, cna, sodium, naphthalene, na, a, strong, reducing, agent, forms, upon, mixing, na, and, naphthalene, in, ethereal, solutions, sodium, forms, alloys, with, many, metals, such, as, potassium, calcium, lead, and, the, group, 11, and, 12, elements, sodium, and, potassium, form, kna, 2, and, nak, nak, is, 40, 90, potassium, and, it, is, liquid, at, ambient, temperature, it, is, an, excellent, thermal, and, electrical, conductor, sodium, calcium, alloys, are, by, products, of, the, electrolytic, production, of, sodium, from, a, binary, salt, mixture, of, nacl, cacl, 2, and, ternary, mixture, nacl, cacl, 2, bacl, 2, calcium, is, only, partially, miscible, with, sodium, and, the, 1, 2, of, it, dissolved, in, the, sodium, obtained, from, said, mixtures, can, be, precipitated, by, cooling, to, 120, c, and, filtering, in, a, liquid, state, sodium, is, completely, miscible, with, lead, there, are, several, methods, to, make, sodium, lead, alloys, one, is, to, melt, them, together, and, another, is, to, deposit, sodium, electrolytically, on, molten, lead, cathodes, napb, 3, napb, na, 9, pb, 4, na, 5, pb, 2, and, na, 15, pb, 4, are, some, of, the, known, sodium, lead, alloys, sodium, also, forms, alloys, with, gold, naau, 2, and, silver, naag, 2, group, 12, metals, zinc, cadmium, and, mercury, are, known, to, make, alloys, with, sodium, nazn, 13, and, nacd, 2, are, alloys, of, zinc, and, cadmium, sodium, and, mercury, form, nahg, nahg, 4, nahg, 2, na, 3, hg, 2, and, na, 3, hg, because, of, its, importance, in, human, health, salt, has, long, been, an, important, commodity, in, medieval, europe, a, compound, of, sodium, with, the, latin, name, of, sodanum, was, used, as, a, headache, remedy, the, name, sodium, is, thought, to, originate, from, the, arabic, suda, meaning, headache, as, the, headache, alleviating, properties, of, sodium, carbonate, or, soda, were, well, known, in, early, times, although, sodium, sometimes, called, soda, had, long, been, recognized, in, compounds, the, metal, itself, was, not, isolated, until, 1807, by, sir, humphry, davy, through, the, electrolysis, of, sodium, hydroxide, in, 1809, the, german, physicist, and, chemist, ludwig, wilhelm, gilbert, proposed, the, names, natronium, for, humphry, davy, s, sodium, and, kalium, for, davy, s, potassium, the, chemical, abbreviation, for, sodium, was, first, published, in, 1814, by, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, in, his, system, of, atomic, symbols, and, is, an, abbreviation, of, the, element, s, neo, latin, name, natrium, which, refers, to, the, egyptian, natron, a, natural, mineral, salt, mainly, consisting, of, hydrated, sodium, carbonate, natron, historically, had, several, important, industrial, and, household, uses, later, eclipsed, by, other, sodium, compounds, sodium, imparts, an, intense, yellow, color, to, flames, as, early, as, 1860, kirchhoff, and, bunsen, noted, the, high, sensitivity, of, a, sodium, flame, test, and, stated, in, annalen, der, physik, und, chemie, in, a, corner, of, our, 60, m, 3, room, farthest, away, from, the, apparatus, we, exploded, 3, mg, of, sodium, chlorate, with, milk, sugar, while, observing, the, nonluminous, flame, before, the, slit, after, a, while, it, glowed, a, bright, yellow, and, showed, a, strong, sodium, line, that, disappeared, only, after, 10, minutes, from, the, weight, of, the, sodium, salt, and, the, volume, of, air, in, the, room, we, easily, calculate, that, one, part, by, weight, of, air, could, not, contain, more, than, 1, 20, millionth, weight, of, sodium, the, earth, s, crust, contains, 2, 27, sodium, making, it, the, sixth, most, abundant, element, on, earth, and, the, fourth, most, abundant, metal, behind, aluminium, iron, calcium, and, magnesium, and, ahead, of, potassium, sodium, s, estimated, oceanic, abundance, is, 10, 8, grams, per, liter, because, of, its, high, reactivity, it, is, never, found, as, a, pure, element, it, is, found, in, many, minerals, some, very, soluble, such, as, halite, and, natron, others, much, less, soluble, such, as, amphibole, and, zeolite, the, insolubility, of, certain, sodium, minerals, such, as, cryolite, and, feldspar, arises, from, their, polymeric, anions, which, in, the, case, of, feldspar, is, a, polysilicate, in, the, universe, sodium, is, the, 15th, most, abundant, element, with, a, 20, 000, parts, per, billion, abundance, making, sodium, 0, 002, of, the, total, atoms, in, the, universe, atomic, sodium, has, a, very, strong, spectral, line, in, the, yellow, orange, part, of, the, spectrum, the, same, line, as, is, used, in, sodium, vapour, street, lights, this, appears, as, an, absorption, line, in, many, types, of, stars, including, the, sun, the, line, was, first, studied, in, 1814, by, joseph, von, fraunhofer, during, his, investigation, of, the, lines, in, the, solar, spectrum, now, known, as, the, fraunhofer, lines, fraunhofer, named, it, the, d, line, although, it, is, now, known, to, actually, be, a, group, of, closely, spaced, lines, split, by, a, fine, and, hyperfine, structure, the, strength, of, the, d, line, allows, its, detection, in, many, other, astronomical, environments, in, stars, it, is, seen, in, any, whose, surfaces, are, cool, enough, for, sodium, to, exist, in, atomic, form, rather, than, ionised, this, corresponds, to, stars, of, roughly, f, type, and, cooler, many, other, stars, appear, to, have, a, sodium, absorption, line, but, this, is, actually, caused, by, gas, in, the, foreground, interstellar, medium, the, two, can, be, distinguished, via, high, resolution, spectroscopy, because, interstellar, lines, are, much, narrower, than, those, broadened, by, stellar, rotation, sodium, has, also, been, detected, in, numerous, solar, system, environments, including, the, exospheres, of, mercury, and, the, moon, and, numerous, other, bodies, some, comets, have, a, sodium, tail, which, was, first, detected, in, observations, of, comet, hale, bopp, in, 1997, sodium, has, even, been, detected, in, the, atmospheres, of, some, extrasolar, planets, via, transit, spectroscopy, employed, in, rather, specialized, applications, about, 100, 000, tonnes, of, metallic, sodium, are, produced, annually, metallic, sodium, was, first, produced, commercially, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, by, carbothermal, reduction, of, sodium, carbonate, at, 1100, c, as, the, first, step, of, the, deville, process, for, the, production, of, aluminium, the, high, demand, for, aluminium, created, the, need, for, the, production, of, sodium, the, introduction, of, the, hall, h, roult, process, for, the, production, of, aluminium, by, electrolysing, a, molten, salt, bath, ended, the, need, for, large, quantities, of, sodium, a, related, process, based, on, the, reduction, of, sodium, hydroxide, was, developed, in, 1886, sodium, is, now, produced, commercially, through, the, electrolysis, of, molten, sodium, chloride, common, salt, based, on, a, process, patented, in, 1924, this, is, done, in, a, downs, cell, in, which, the, nacl, is, mixed, with, calcium, chloride, to, lower, the, melting, point, below, 700, c, as, calcium, is, less, electropositive, than, sodium, no, calcium, will, be, deposited, at, the, cathode, this, method, is, less, expensive, than, the, previous, castner, process, the, electrolysis, of, sodium, hydroxide, if, sodium, of, high, purity, is, required, it, can, be, distilled, once, or, several, times, the, market, for, sodium, is, volatile, due, to, the, difficulty, in, its, storage, and, shipping, it, must, be, stored, under, a, dry, inert, gas, atmosphere, or, anhydrous, mineral, oil, to, prevent, the, formation, of, a, surface, layer, of, sodium, oxide, or, sodium, superoxide, though, metallic, sodium, has, some, important, uses, the, major, applications, for, sodium, use, compounds, millions, of, tons, of, sodium, chloride, hydroxide, and, carbonate, are, produced, annually, sodium, chloride, is, extensively, used, for, anti, icing, and, de, icing, and, as, a, preservative, examples, of, the, uses, of, sodium, bicarbonate, include, baking, as, a, raising, agent, and, sodablasting, along, with, potassium, many, important, medicines, have, sodium, added, to, improve, their, bioavailability, though, potassium, is, the, better, ion, in, most, cases, sodium, is, chosen, for, its, lower, price, and, atomic, weight, sodium, hydride, is, used, as, a, base, for, various, reactions, such, as, the, aldol, reaction, in, organic, chemistry, metallic, sodium, is, used, mainly, for, the, production, of, sodium, borohydride, sodium, azide, indigo, and, triphenylphosphine, a, once, common, use, was, the, making, of, tetraethyllead, and, titanium, metal, because, of, the, move, away, from, tel, and, new, titanium, production, methods, the, production, of, sodium, declined, after, 1970, sodium, is, also, used, as, an, alloying, metal, an, anti, scaling, agent, and, as, a, reducing, agent, for, metals, when, other, materials, are, ineffective, note, the, free, element, is, not, used, as, a, scaling, agent, ions, in, the, water, are, exchanged, for, sodium, ions, sodium, plasma, vapor, lamps, are, often, used, for, street, lighting, in, cities, shedding, light, that, ranges, from, yellow, orange, to, peach, as, the, pressure, increases, by, itself, or, with, potassium, sodium, is, a, desiccant, it, gives, an, intense, blue, coloration, with, benzophenone, when, the, desiccate, is, dry, in, organic, synthesis, sodium, is, used, in, various, reactions, such, as, the, birch, reduction, and, the, sodium, fusion, test, is, conducted, to, qualitatively, analyse, compounds, sodium, reacts, with, alcohols, and, gives, alkoxides, and, when, sodium, is, dissolved, in, ammonia, solution, it, can, be, used, to, reduce, alkynes, to, trans, alkenes, lasers, emitting, light, at, the, sodium, d, line, are, used, to, create, artificial, laser, guide, stars, that, assist, in, the, adaptive, optics, for, land, based, visible, light, telescopes, liquid, sodium, is, used, as, a, heat, transfer, fluid, in, sodium, cooled, fast, reactors, because, it, has, the, high, thermal, conductivity, and, low, neutron, absorption, cross, section, required, to, achieve, a, high, neutron, flux, in, the, reactor, the, high, boiling, point, of, sodium, allows, the, reactor, to, operate, at, ambient, normal, pressure, but, drawbacks, include, its, opacity, which, hinders, visual, maintenance, and, its, strongly, reducing, properties, sodium, will, explode, in, contact, with, water, although, it, will, only, burn, gently, in, air, radioactive, sodium, 24, may, be, produced, by, neutron, bombardment, during, operation, posing, a, slight, radiation, hazard, the, radioactivity, stops, within, a, few, days, after, removal, from, the, reactor, if, a, reactor, needs, to, be, shut, down, frequently, nak, is, used, because, nak, is, a, liquid, at, room, temperature, the, coolant, does, not, solidify, in, the, pipes, in, this, case, the, pyrophoricity, of, potassium, requires, extra, precautions, to, prevent, and, detect, leaks, another, heat, transfer, application, is, poppet, valves, in, high, performance, internal, combustion, engines, the, valve, stems, are, partially, filled, with, sodium, and, work, as, a, heat, pipe, to, cool, the, valves, in, humans, sodium, is, an, essential, mineral, that, regulates, blood, volume, blood, pressure, osmotic, equilibrium, and, ph, the, minimum, physiological, requirement, for, sodium, is, estimated, to, range, from, about, 120, milligrams, per, day, in, newborns, to, 500, milligrams, per, day, over, the, age, of, 10, sodium, chloride, also, known, as, edible, salt, or, table, salt, chemical, formula, nacl, is, the, principal, source, of, sodium, na, in, the, diet, and, is, used, as, seasoning, and, preservative, in, such, commodities, as, pickled, preserves, and, jerky, for, americans, most, sodium, chloride, comes, from, processed, foods, other, sources, of, sodium, are, its, natural, occurrence, in, food, and, such, food, additives, as, monosodium, glutamate, msg, sodium, nitrite, sodium, saccharin, baking, soda, sodium, bicarbonate, and, sodium, benzoate, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, set, its, tolerable, upper, intake, level, for, sodium, at, 2, 3, grams, per, day, but, the, average, person, in, the, united, states, consumes, 3, 4, grams, per, day, the, american, heart, association, recommends, no, more, than, 1, 5, g, of, sodium, per, day, the, committee, to, review, the, dietary, reference, intakes, for, sodium, and, potassium, which, is, part, of, the, national, academies, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, has, determined, that, there, isn, t, enough, evidence, from, research, studies, to, establish, estimated, average, requirement, ear, and, recommended, dietary, allowance, rda, values, for, sodium, as, a, result, the, committee, has, established, adequate, intake, ai, levels, instead, as, follows, the, sodium, ai, for, infants, of, 0, 6, months, is, established, at, 110, mg, day, 7, 12, months, 370, mg, day, for, children, 1, 3, years, 800, mg, day, 4, 8, years, 1, 000, mg, day, for, adolescents, 9, 13, years, 1, 200, mg, day, 14, 18, years, 1, 500, mg, day, for, adults, regardless, of, their, age, or, sex, 1, 500, mg, day, sodium, chloride, nacl, contains, approximately, 39, 34, of, elemental, sodium, na, the, total, mass, this, means, that, 1, gram, of, sodium, chloride, contains, approximately, 393, 4, mg, of, elemental, sodium, for, example, to, find, out, how, much, sodium, chloride, contains, 1500, mg, of, elemental, sodium, the, value, of, 1500, mg, sodium, is, the, adequate, intake, ai, for, an, adult, we, can, use, the, proportion, solving, for, x, gives, us, the, amount, of, sodium, chloride, that, contains, 1500, mg, of, elemental, sodium, this, mean, that, 3812, 91, mg, of, sodium, chloride, contain, 1500, mg, of, elemental, sodium, high, sodium, consumption, is, unhealthy, and, can, lead, to, alteration, in, the, mechanical, performance, of, the, heart, high, sodium, consumption, is, also, associated, with, chronic, kidney, disease, high, blood, pressure, cardiovascular, diseases, and, stroke, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, higher, sodium, intake, and, higher, blood, pressure, studies, have, found, that, lowering, sodium, intake, by, 2, g, per, day, tends, to, lower, systolic, blood, pressure, by, about, two, to, four, mm, hg, it, has, been, estimated, that, such, a, decrease, in, sodium, intake, would, lead, to, 9, 17, fewer, cases, of, hypertension, hypertension, causes, 7, 6, million, premature, deaths, worldwide, each, year, since, edible, salt, contains, about, 39, 3, sodium, the, rest, being, chlorine, and, trace, chemicals, thus, 2, 3, g, sodium, is, about, 5, 9, g, or, 5, 3, ml, of, salt, about, one, us, teaspoon, one, scientific, review, found, that, people, with, or, without, hypertension, who, excreted, less, than, 3, grams, of, sodium, per, day, in, their, urine, and, therefore, were, taking, in, less, than, 3, g, d, had, a, higher, risk, of, death, stroke, or, heart, attack, than, those, excreting, 4, to, 5, grams, per, day, levels, of, 7, g, per, day, or, more, in, people, with, hypertension, were, associated, with, higher, mortality, and, cardiovascular, events, but, this, was, not, found, to, be, true, for, people, without, hypertension, the, us, fda, states, that, adults, with, hypertension, and, prehypertension, should, reduce, daily, sodium, intake, to, 1, 5, g, the, renin, angiotensin, system, regulates, the, amount, of, fluid, and, sodium, concentration, in, the, body, reduction, of, blood, pressure, and, sodium, concentration, in, the, kidney, result, in, the, production, of, renin, which, in, turn, produces, aldosterone, and, angiotensin, which, stimulates, the, reabsorption, of, sodium, back, into, the, bloodstream, when, the, concentration, of, sodium, increases, the, production, of, renin, decreases, and, the, sodium, concentration, returns, to, normal, the, sodium, ion, na, is, an, important, electrolyte, in, neuron, function, and, in, osmoregulation, between, cells, and, the, extracellular, fluid, this, is, accomplished, in, all, animals, by, na, k, atpase, an, active, transporter, pumping, ions, against, the, gradient, and, sodium, potassium, channels, sodium, is, the, most, prevalent, metallic, ion, in, extracellular, fluid, in, humans, unusually, low, or, high, sodium, levels, in, the, blood, is, recognized, in, medicine, as, hyponatremia, and, hypernatremia, these, conditions, may, be, caused, by, genetic, factors, ageing, or, prolonged, vomiting, or, diarrhea, in, c4, plants, sodium, is, a, micronutrient, that, aids, metabolism, specifically, in, regeneration, of, phosphoenolpyruvate, and, synthesis, of, chlorophyll, in, others, it, substitutes, for, potassium, in, several, roles, such, as, maintaining, turgor, pressure, and, aiding, in, the, opening, and, closing, of, stomata, excess, sodium, in, the, soil, can, limit, the, uptake, of, water, by, decreasing, the, water, potential, which, may, result, in, plant, wilting, excess, concentrations, in, the, cytoplasm, can, lead, to, enzyme, inhibition, which, in, turn, causes, necrosis, and, chlorosis, in, response, some, plants, have, developed, mechanisms, to, limit, sodium, uptake, in, the, roots, to, store, it, in, cell, vacuoles, and, restrict, salt, transport, from, roots, to, leaves, excess, sodium, may, also, be, stored, in, old, plant, tissue, limiting, the, damage, to, new, growth, halophytes, have, adapted, to, be, able, to, flourish, in, sodium, rich, environments, sodium, forms, flammable, hydrogen, and, caustic, sodium, hydroxide, on, contact, with, water, ingestion, and, contact, with, moisture, on, skin, eyes, or, mucous, membranes, can, cause, severe, burns, sodium, spontaneously, explodes, in, the, presence, of, water, due, to, the, formation, of, hydrogen, highly, explosive, and, sodium, hydroxide, which, dissolves, in, the, water, liberating, more, surface, however, sodium, exposed, to, air, and, ignited, or, reaching, autoignition, reported, to, occur, when, a, molten, pool, of, sodium, reaches, about, 290, c, 554, f, displays, a, relatively, mild, fire, in, the, case, of, massive, non, molten, pieces, of, sodium, the, reaction, with, oxygen, eventually, becomes, slow, due, to, formation, of, a, protective, layer, fire, extinguishers, based, on, water, accelerate, sodium, fires, those, based, on, carbon, dioxide, and, bromochlorodifluoromethane, should, not, be, used, on, sodium, fire, metal, fires, are, class, d, but, not, all, class, d, extinguishers, are, effective, when, used, to, extinguish, sodium, fires, an, effective, extinguishing, agent, for, sodium, fires, is, met, l, x, other, effective, agents, include, lith, x, which, has, graphite, powder, and, an, organophosphate, flame, retardant, and, dry, sand, sodium, fires, are, prevented, in, nuclear, reactors, by, isolating, sodium, from, oxygen, with, surrounding, pipes, containing, inert, gas, pool, type, sodium, fires, are, prevented, using, diverse, design, measures, called, catch, pan, systems, they, collect, leaking, sodium, into, a, leak, recovery, tank, where, it, is, isolated, from, oxygen, liquid, sodium, fires, are, more, dangerous, to, handle, than, solid, sodium, fires, particularly, if, there, is, insufficient, experience, with, the, safe, handling, of, molten, sodium, in, a, technical, report, for, the, united, states, fire, administration, r, j, gordon, writes, emphasis, in, original, once, ignited, sodium, is, very, difficult, to, extinguish, it, will, react, violently, with, water, as, noted, previously, and, with, any, extinguishing, agent, that, contains, water, it, will, also, react, with, many, other, common, extinguishing, agents, including, carbon, dioxide, and, the, halogen, compounds, and, most, dry, chemical, agents, the, only, safe, and, effective, extinguishing, agents, are, completely, dry, inert, materials, such, as, class, d, extinguishing, agents, soda, ash, graphite, diatomaceous, earth, or, sodium, chloride, all, of, which, can, be, used, to, bury, a, small, quantity, of, burning, sodium, and, exclude, oxygen, from, reaching, the, metal, the, extinguishing, agent, must, be, absolutely, dry, as, even, a, trace, of, water, in, the, material, can, react, with, the, burning, sodium, to, cause, an, explosion, sodium, chloride, is, recognized, as, an, extinguishing, medium, because, of, its, chemical, stability, however, it, is, hydroscopic, has, the, property, of, attracting, and, holding, water, molecules, on, the, surface, of, the, salt, crystals, and, must, be, kept, absolutely, dry, to, be, used, safely, as, an, extinguishing, agent, every, crystal, of, sodium, chloride, also, contains, a, trace, quantity, of, moisture, within, the, structure, of, the, crystal, molten, sodium, is, extremely, dangerous, because, it, is, much, more, reactive, than, a, solid, mass, in, the, liquid, form, every, sodium, atom, is, free, and, mobile, to, instantaneously, combine, with, any, available, oxygen, atom, or, other, oxidizer, and, any, gaseous, by, product, will, be, created, as, a, rapidly, expanding, gas, bubble, within, the, molten, mass, even, a, minute, amount, of, water, can, create, this, type, of, reaction, any, amount, of, water, introduced, into, a, pool, of, molten, sodium, is, likely, to, cause, a, violent, explosion, inside, the, liquid, mass, releasing, the, hydrogen, as, a, rapidly, expanding, gas, and, causing, the, molten, sodium, to, erupt, from, the, container, when, molten, sodium, is, involved, in, a, fire, the, combustion, occurs, at, the, surface, of, the, liquid, an, inert, gas, such, as, nitrogen, or, argon, can, be, used, to, form, an, inert, layer, over, the, pool, of, burning, liquid, sodium, but, the, gas, must, be, applied, very, gently, and, contained, over, the, surface, except, for, soda, ash, most, of, the, powdered, agents, that, are, used, to, extinguish, small, fires, in, solid, pieces, or, shallow, pools, will, sink, to, the, bottom, of, a, molten, mass, of, burning, sodium, the, sodium, will, float, to, the, top, and, continue, to, burn, if, the, burning, sodium, is, in, a, container, it, may, be, feasible, to, extinguish, the, fire, by, placing, a, lid, on, the, container, to, exclude, oxygen
