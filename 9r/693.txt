the, quaternary, k, w, t, r, n, r, i, k, w, t, r, n, r, i, kw, tur, n, ree, kwot, r, nerr, ee, is, the, current, and, most, recent, of, the, three, periods, of, the, cenozoic, era, in, the, geologic, time, scale, of, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, it, follows, the, neogene, period, and, spans, from, 2, 58, million, years, ago, to, the, present, the, quaternary, period, is, divided, into, two, epochs, the, pleistocene, 2, 58, million, years, ago, to, 11, 7, thousand, years, ago, and, the, holocene, 11, 7, thousand, years, ago, to, today, a, proposed, third, epoch, the, anthropocene, was, rejected, in, 2024, by, iugs, the, governing, body, of, the, ics, the, quaternary, period, is, typically, defined, by, the, cyclic, growth, and, decay, of, continental, ice, sheets, related, to, the, milankovitch, cycles, and, the, associated, climate, and, environmental, changes, that, they, caused, in, 1759, giovanni, arduino, proposed, that, the, geological, strata, of, northern, italy, could, be, divided, into, four, successive, formations, or, orders, italian, quattro, ordini, the, term, quaternary, was, introduced, by, jules, desnoyers, in, 1829, for, sediments, of, france, s, seine, basin, that, clearly, seemed, to, be, younger, than, tertiary, period, rocks, the, quaternary, period, follows, the, neogene, period, and, extends, to, the, present, the, quaternary, covers, the, time, span, of, glaciations, classified, as, the, pleistocene, and, includes, the, present, interglacial, time, period, the, holocene, this, places, the, start, of, the, quaternary, at, the, onset, of, northern, hemisphere, glaciation, approximately, 2, 6, million, years, ago, mya, prior, to, 2009, the, pleistocene, was, defined, to, be, from, 1, 805, million, years, ago, to, the, present, so, the, current, definition, of, the, pleistocene, includes, a, portion, of, what, was, prior, to, 2009, defined, as, the, pliocene, quaternary, stratigraphers, usually, worked, with, regional, subdivisions, from, the, 1970s, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, tried, to, make, a, single, geologic, time, scale, based, on, gssp, s, which, could, be, used, internationally, the, quaternary, subdivisions, were, defined, based, on, biostratigraphy, instead, of, paleoclimate, this, led, to, the, problem, that, the, proposed, base, of, the, pleistocene, was, at, 1, 805, million, years, ago, long, after, the, start, of, the, major, glaciations, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, ics, then, proposed, to, abolish, use, of, the, name, quaternary, altogether, which, appeared, unacceptable, to, the, international, union, for, quaternary, research, inqua, in, 2009, it, was, decided, to, make, the, quaternary, the, youngest, period, of, the, cenozoic, era, with, its, base, at, 2, 588, mya, and, including, the, gelasian, stage, which, was, formerly, considered, part, of, the, neogene, period, and, pliocene, epoch, this, was, later, revised, to, 2, 58, mya, the, anthropocene, was, proposed, as, a, third, epoch, as, a, mark, of, the, anthropogenic, impact, on, the, global, environment, starting, with, the, industrial, revolution, or, about, 200, years, ago, the, anthropocene, was, rejected, as, a, geological, epoch, in, 2024, by, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, iugs, the, governing, body, of, the, ics, the, 2, 58, million, years, of, the, quaternary, represents, the, time, during, which, recognisable, humans, existed, over, this, geologically, short, time, period, there, has, been, relatively, little, change, in, the, distribution, of, the, continents, due, to, plate, tectonics, the, quaternary, geological, record, is, preserved, in, greater, detail, than, that, for, earlier, periods, the, major, geographical, changes, during, this, time, period, included, the, emergence, of, the, strait, of, bosphorus, and, skagerrak, during, glacial, epochs, which, respectively, turned, the, black, sea, and, baltic, sea, into, fresh, water, lakes, followed, by, their, flooding, and, return, to, salt, water, by, rising, sea, level, the, periodic, filling, of, the, english, channel, forming, a, land, bridge, between, britain, and, the, european, mainland, the, periodic, closing, of, the, bering, strait, forming, the, land, bridge, between, asia, and, north, america, and, the, periodic, flash, flooding, of, scablands, of, the, american, northwest, by, glacial, water, the, current, extent, of, hudson, bay, the, great, lakes, and, other, major, lakes, of, north, america, are, a, consequence, of, the, canadian, shield, s, readjustment, since, the, last, ice, age, different, shorelines, have, existed, over, the, course, of, quaternary, time, the, climate, was, one, of, periodic, glaciations, with, continental, glaciers, moving, as, far, from, the, poles, as, 40, degrees, latitude, glaciation, took, place, repeatedly, during, the, quaternary, ice, age, a, term, coined, by, schimper, in, 1839, that, began, with, the, start, of, the, quaternary, about, 2, 58, mya, and, continues, to, the, present, day, in, 1821, a, swiss, engineer, ignaz, venetz, presented, an, article, in, which, he, suggested, the, presence, of, traces, of, the, passage, of, a, glacier, at, a, considerable, distance, from, the, alps, this, idea, was, initially, disputed, by, another, swiss, scientist, louis, agassiz, but, when, he, undertook, to, disprove, it, he, ended, up, affirming, his, colleague, s, hypothesis, a, year, later, agassiz, raised, the, hypothesis, of, a, great, glacial, period, that, would, have, had, long, reaching, general, effects, this, idea, gained, him, international, fame, and, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, glacial, theory, in, time, thanks, to, the, refinement, of, geology, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, there, were, several, periods, of, glacial, advance, and, retreat, and, that, past, temperatures, on, earth, were, very, different, from, today, in, particular, the, milankovitch, cycles, of, milutin, milankovitch, are, based, on, the, premise, that, variations, in, incoming, solar, radiation, are, a, fundamental, factor, controlling, earth, s, climate, during, this, time, substantial, glaciers, advanced, and, retreated, over, much, of, north, america, and, europe, parts, of, south, america, and, asia, and, all, of, antarctica, there, was, a, major, extinction, of, large, mammals, globally, during, the, late, pleistocene, epoch, many, forms, such, as, sabre, toothed, cats, mammoths, mastodons, glyptodonts, etc, became, extinct, worldwide, others, including, horses, camels, and, american, cheetahs, became, extinct, in, north, america, the, great, lakes, formed, and, giant, mammals, thrived, in, parts, of, north, america, and, eurasia, not, covered, in, ice, these, mammals, became, extinct, when, the, glacial, period, ended, about, 11, 700, years, ago, modern, humans, evolved, about, 315, 000, years, ago, during, the, quaternary, period, mammals, flowering, plants, and, insects, dominated, the, land
