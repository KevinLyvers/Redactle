hydrochloric, acid, also, known, as, muriatic, acid, or, spirits, of, salt, is, an, aqueous, solution, of, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, it, is, a, colorless, solution, with, a, distinctive, pungent, smell, it, is, classified, as, a, strong, acid, it, is, a, component, of, the, gastric, acid, in, the, digestive, systems, of, most, animal, species, including, humans, hydrochloric, acid, is, an, important, laboratory, reagent, and, industrial, chemical, because, it, was, produced, from, rock, salt, according, to, the, methods, of, johann, rudolph, glauber, hydrochloric, acid, was, historically, called, by, european, alchemists, spirits, of, salt, or, acidum, salis, salt, acid, both, names, are, still, used, especially, in, other, languages, such, as, german, salzs, ure, dutch, zoutzuur, swedish, saltsyra, finnish, suolahappo, spanish, salfum, n, turkish, tuz, ruhu, polish, kwas, solny, hungarian, s, sav, czech, kyselina, soln, japanese, ensan, chinese, y, nsu, n, and, korean, yeomsan, gaseous, hcl, was, called, marine, acid, air, the, name, muriatic, acid, has, the, same, origin, muriatic, means, pertaining, to, brine, or, salt, hence, muriate, means, hydrochloride, and, this, name, is, still, sometimes, used, the, name, hydrochloric, acid, was, coined, by, the, french, chemist, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, in, 1814, in, the, early, tenth, century, the, persian, physician, and, alchemist, abu, bakr, al, razi, c, 865, 925, latin, rhazes, conducted, experiments, with, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, and, vitriol, hydrated, sulfates, of, various, metals, which, he, distilled, together, thus, producing, the, gas, hydrogen, chloride, in, doing, so, al, razi, may, have, stumbled, upon, a, primitive, method, for, producing, hydrochloric, acid, as, perhaps, manifested, in, the, following, recipe, from, his, kit, b, al, asr, r, the, book, of, secrets, take, equal, parts, of, sweet, salt, bitter, salt, abarzad, salt, andar, n, salt, indian, salt, salt, of, al, qil, and, salt, of, urine, after, adding, an, equal, weight, of, good, crystallised, sal, ammoniac, dissolve, by, moisture, and, distil, the, mixture, there, will, distil, over, a, strong, water, which, will, cleave, stone, sakhr, instantly, however, it, appears, that, in, most, of, his, experiments, al, razi, disregarded, the, gaseous, products, concentrating, instead, on, the, color, changes, that, could, be, effected, in, the, residue, according, to, robert, p, multhauf, hydrogen, chloride, was, produced, many, times, without, clear, recognition, that, by, dissolving, it, in, water, hydrochloric, acid, may, be, produced, drawing, on, al, razi, s, experiments, the, de, aluminibus, et, salibus, on, alums, and, salts, an, eleventh, or, twelfth, century, arabic, text, falsely, attributed, to, al, razi, and, translated, into, latin, by, gerard, of, cremona, 1144, 1187, described, the, heating, of, metals, with, various, salts, which, in, the, case, of, mercury, resulted, in, the, production, of, mercury, ii, chloride, corrosive, sublimate, in, this, process, hydrochloric, acid, actually, started, to, form, but, it, immediately, reacted, with, the, mercury, to, produce, corrosive, sublimate, thirteenth, century, latin, alchemists, for, whom, the, de, aluminibus, et, salibus, was, one, of, the, main, reference, works, were, fascinated, by, the, chlorinating, properties, of, corrosive, sublimate, and, they, soon, discovered, that, when, the, metals, are, eliminated, from, the, process, of, heating, vitriols, alums, and, salts, strong, mineral, acids, can, directly, be, distilled, one, important, invention, that, resulted, from, the, discovery, of, the, mineral, acids, is, aqua, regia, a, mixture, of, nitric, acid, and, hydrochloric, acid, in, a, 1, 3, proportion, capable, of, dissolving, gold, this, was, first, described, in, pseudo, geber, s, de, inventione, veritatis, on, the, discovery, of, truth, after, c, 1300, where, aqua, regia, was, prepared, by, adding, ammonium, chloride, to, nitric, acid, the, fact, that, aqua, regia, typically, is, defined, as, a, mixture, of, nitric, acid, and, hydrochloric, acid, does, not, mean, that, hydrochloric, acid, was, discovered, before, or, simultaneously, with, aqua, regia, the, isolation, of, hydrochloric, acid, happened, about, 300, years, later, the, production, of, hydrochloric, acid, itself, i, e, as, an, isolated, substance, rather, than, as, already, mixed, with, nitric, acid, depended, on, the, use, of, more, efficient, cooling, apparatus, which, would, only, develop, in, subsequent, centuries, from, the, point, of, view, of, western, history, of, chemistry, hydrochloric, acid, was, the, last, of, the, three, well, known, mineral, acids, for, which, the, method, of, its, production, appeared, in, the, literature, recipes, for, its, production, started, to, appear, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, the, earliest, recipes, for, the, production, of, hydrochloric, acid, are, found, in, giovanni, battista, della, porta, s, 1535, 1615, magiae, naturalis, natural, magic, and, in, the, works, of, other, contemporary, chemists, like, andreas, libavius, c, 1550, 1616, jean, beguin, 1550, 1620, and, oswald, croll, c, 1563, 1609, among, the, historians, who, have, written, about, this, are, german, chemists, hermann, franz, moritz, kopp, 1845, and, edmund, oscar, von, lippmann, 1938, mining, engineer, and, future, u, s, president, herbert, hoover, with, his, wife, geologist, lou, henry, hoover, 1912, dutch, chemist, robert, jacobus, forbes, 1948, american, chemist, mary, elvira, weeks, 1956, and, british, chemists, f, sherwood, taylor, 1957, and, j, r, partington, 1960, italian, chemist, ladislao, reti, have, summarized, the, result, of, their, efforts, thus, the, first, clear, instance, of, the, preparation, of, hydrochloric, acid, appears, in, the, writings, of, della, porta, 1589, and, 1608, libavius, 1597, pseudo, basil, 1604, van, helmont, 1646, and, glauber, 1648, less, convincing, earlier, references, are, found, in, the, plichto, of, rosetti, 1540, and, in, agricola, 1558, as, for, the, first, practical, method, of, preparation, from, vitriol, and, common, salt, there, is, no, doubt, that, pseudo, basil, precedes, glauber, but, the, latter, has, the, unquestionable, merit, of, having, indicated, the, way, of, producing, the, acid, later, to, be, adopted, by, the, chemical, industry, for, large, scale, operations, the, knowledge, of, mineral, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, would, be, of, key, importance, to, seventeenth, century, chemists, like, daniel, sennert, 1572, 1637, and, robert, boyle, 1627, 1691, who, used, their, capability, to, rapidly, dissolve, metals, in, their, demonstrations, of, the, composite, nature, of, bodies, during, the, industrial, revolution, in, europe, demand, for, alkaline, substances, increased, a, new, industrial, process, developed, by, nicolas, leblanc, of, issoudun, france, enabled, cheap, large, scale, production, of, sodium, carbonate, soda, ash, in, this, leblanc, process, common, salt, is, converted, to, soda, ash, using, sulfuric, acid, limestone, and, coal, releasing, hydrogen, chloride, as, a, by, product, until, the, british, alkali, act, 1863, and, similar, legislation, in, other, countries, the, excess, hcl, was, often, vented, into, the, air, an, early, exception, was, the, bonnington, chemical, works, where, in, 1830, the, hcl, began, to, be, captured, and, the, hydrochloric, acid, produced, was, used, in, making, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, after, the, passage, of, the, act, soda, ash, producers, were, obliged, to, absorb, the, waste, gas, in, water, producing, hydrochloric, acid, on, an, industrial, scale, in, the, 20th, century, the, leblanc, process, was, effectively, replaced, by, the, solvay, process, without, a, hydrochloric, acid, by, product, since, hydrochloric, acid, was, already, fully, settled, as, an, important, chemical, in, numerous, applications, the, commercial, interest, initiated, other, production, methods, some, of, which, are, still, used, today, after, 2000, hydrochloric, acid, is, mostly, made, by, absorbing, by, product, hydrogen, chloride, from, industrial, organic, compounds, production, gaseous, hydrogen, chloride, is, a, molecular, compound, with, a, covalent, bond, between, the, hydrogen, and, chlorine, atoms, in, aqueous, solutions, dissociation, is, complete, with, the, formation, of, chloride, ions, and, hydrated, hydrogen, ions, hydronium, ions, a, combined, ir, raman, x, ray, and, neutron, diffraction, study, of, concentrated, hydrochloric, acid, showed, that, the, hydronium, ion, forms, hydrogen, bonded, complexes, with, other, water, molecules, see, hydronium, for, further, discussion, of, this, issue, the, p, k, a, value, of, hydrochloric, acid, in, aqueous, solution, is, estimated, theoretically, to, be, 5, 9, a, solution, of, hydrogen, chloride, in, water, behaves, as, a, strong, acid, the, concentration, of, hcl, molecules, is, effectively, zero, physical, properties, of, hydrochloric, acid, such, as, boiling, and, melting, points, density, and, ph, depend, on, the, concentration, or, molarity, of, hcl, in, the, aqueous, solution, they, range, from, those, of, water, at, very, low, concentrations, approaching, 0, hcl, to, values, for, fuming, hydrochloric, acid, at, over, 40, hcl, hydrochloric, acid, as, the, binary, two, component, mixture, of, hcl, and, h, 2, o, has, a, constant, boiling, azeotrope, at, 20, 2, hcl, and, 108, 6, c, 381, 8, k, 227, 5, f, there, are, four, constant, crystallization, eutectic, points, for, hydrochloric, acid, between, the, crystal, form, of, cl, 68, hcl, cl, 51, hcl, cl, 41, hcl, cl, 5h, 2, o, 25, hcl, and, ice, 0, hcl, there, is, also, a, metastable, eutectic, point, at, 24, 8, between, ice, and, the, cl, crystallization, they, are, all, hydronium, salts, hydrochloric, acid, is, usually, prepared, industrially, by, dissolving, hydrogen, chloride, in, water, hydrogen, chloride, can, be, generated, in, many, ways, and, thus, several, precursors, to, hydrochloric, acid, exist, the, large, scale, production, of, hydrochloric, acid, is, almost, always, integrated, with, the, industrial, scale, production, of, other, chemicals, such, as, in, the, chloralkali, process, which, produces, hydroxide, hydrogen, and, chlorine, the, latter, of, which, can, be, combined, to, produce, hcl, hydrogen, chloride, is, produced, by, combining, chlorine, and, hydrogen, as, the, reaction, is, exothermic, the, installation, is, called, an, hcl, oven, or, hcl, burner, the, resulting, hydrogen, chloride, gas, is, absorbed, in, deionized, water, resulting, in, chemically, pure, hydrochloric, acid, this, reaction, can, give, a, very, pure, product, e, g, for, use, in, the, food, industry, hydrochloric, acid, is, produced, in, solutions, up, to, 38, hcl, concentrated, grade, higher, concentrations, up, to, just, over, 40, are, chemically, possible, but, the, evaporation, rate, is, then, so, high, that, storage, and, handling, require, extra, precautions, such, as, pressurization, and, cooling, bulk, industrial, grade, is, therefore, 30, to, 35, optimized, to, balance, transport, efficiency, and, product, loss, through, evaporation, in, the, united, states, solutions, of, between, 20, and, 32, are, sold, as, muriatic, acid, solutions, for, household, purposes, in, the, us, mostly, cleaning, are, typically, 10, to, 12, with, strong, recommendations, to, dilute, before, use, in, the, united, kingdom, where, it, is, sold, as, spirits, of, salt, for, domestic, cleaning, the, potency, is, the, same, as, the, us, industrial, grade, in, other, countries, such, as, italy, hydrochloric, acid, for, domestic, or, industrial, cleaning, is, sold, as, acido, muriatico, and, its, concentration, ranges, from, 5, to, 32, major, producers, worldwide, include, dow, chemical, at, 2, million, tonnes, annually, mt, year, calculated, as, hcl, gas, georgia, gulf, corporation, tosoh, corporation, akzo, nobel, and, tessenderlo, at, 0, 5, to, 1, 5, mt, year, each, total, world, production, for, comparison, purposes, expressed, as, hcl, is, estimated, at, 20, mt, year, with, 3, mt, year, from, direct, synthesis, and, the, rest, as, secondary, product, from, organic, and, similar, syntheses, by, far, most, hydrochloric, acid, is, consumed, captively, by, the, producer, the, open, world, market, size, is, estimated, at, 5, mt, year, hydrochloric, acid, is, a, strong, inorganic, acid, that, is, used, in, many, industrial, processes, such, as, refining, metal, the, application, often, determines, the, required, product, quality, hydrogen, chloride, not, hydrochloric, acid, is, used, more, widely, in, industrial, organic, chemistry, e, g, for, vinyl, chloride, and, dichloroethane, one, of, the, most, important, applications, of, hydrochloric, acid, is, in, the, pickling, of, steel, to, remove, rust, or, iron, oxide, scale, from, iron, or, steel, before, subsequent, processing, such, as, extrusion, rolling, galvanizing, and, other, techniques, technical, quality, hcl, at, typically, 18, concentration, is, the, most, commonly, used, pickling, agent, for, the, pickling, of, carbon, steel, grades, the, spent, acid, has, long, been, reused, as, iron, ii, chloride, also, known, as, ferrous, chloride, solutions, but, high, heavy, metal, levels, in, the, pickling, liquor, have, decreased, this, practice, the, steel, pickling, industry, has, developed, hydrochloric, acid, regeneration, processes, such, as, the, spray, roaster, or, the, fluidized, bed, hcl, regeneration, process, which, allow, the, recovery, of, hcl, from, spent, pickling, liquor, the, most, common, regeneration, process, is, the, pyrohydrolysis, process, applying, the, following, formula, by, recuperation, of, the, spent, acid, a, closed, acid, loop, is, established, the, iron, iii, oxide, by, product, of, the, regeneration, process, is, valuable, used, in, a, variety, of, secondary, industries, akin, to, its, use, for, pickling, hydrochloric, acid, is, used, to, dissolve, many, metals, metal, oxides, and, metal, carbonates, the, conversions, are, often, depicted, in, simplified, equations, these, processes, are, used, to, produce, metal, chlorides, for, analysis, or, further, production, hydrochloric, acid, can, be, used, to, regulate, the, acidity, ph, of, solutions, in, industry, demanding, purity, food, pharmaceutical, drinking, water, high, quality, hydrochloric, acid, is, used, to, control, the, ph, of, process, water, streams, in, less, demanding, industry, technical, quality, hydrochloric, acid, suffices, for, neutralizing, waste, streams, and, swimming, pool, ph, control, high, quality, hydrochloric, acid, is, used, in, the, regeneration, of, ion, exchange, resins, cation, exchange, is, widely, used, to, remove, ions, such, as, na, and, ca, 2, from, aqueous, solutions, producing, demineralized, water, the, acid, is, used, to, rinse, the, cations, from, the, resins, na, is, replaced, with, h, and, ca, 2, with, 2, h, ion, exchangers, and, demineralized, water, are, used, in, all, chemical, industries, drinking, water, production, and, many, food, industries, of, the, common, strong, mineral, acids, in, chemistry, hydrochloric, acid, is, the, monoprotic, acid, least, likely, to, undergo, an, interfering, oxidation, reduction, reaction, it, is, one, of, the, least, hazardous, strong, acids, to, handle, despite, its, acidity, it, contains, the, non, reactive, and, non, toxic, chloride, ion, intermediate, strength, hydrochloric, acid, solutions, are, quite, stable, upon, storage, maintaining, their, concentrations, over, time, these, attributes, plus, the, fact, that, it, is, available, as, a, pure, reagent, make, hydrochloric, acid, an, excellent, acidifying, reagent, it, is, also, inexpensive, hydrochloric, acid, is, the, preferred, acid, in, titration, for, determining, the, amount, of, bases, strong, acid, titrants, give, more, precise, results, due, to, a, more, distinct, endpoint, azeotropic, or, constant, boiling, hydrochloric, acid, roughly, 20, 2, can, be, used, as, a, primary, standard, in, quantitative, analysis, although, its, exact, concentration, depends, on, the, atmospheric, pressure, when, it, is, prepared, hydrochloric, acid, is, used, for, a, large, number, of, small, scale, applications, such, as, leather, processing, household, cleaning, and, building, construction, oil, production, may, be, stimulated, by, injecting, hydrochloric, acid, into, the, rock, formation, of, an, oil, well, dissolving, a, portion, of, the, rock, and, creating, a, large, pore, structure, oil, well, acidizing, is, a, common, process, in, the, north, sea, oil, production, industry, hydrochloric, acid, has, been, used, for, dissolving, calcium, carbonate, e, g, such, things, as, de, scaling, kettles, and, for, cleaning, mortar, off, brickwork, when, used, on, brickwork, the, reaction, with, the, mortar, only, continues, until, the, acid, has, all, been, converted, producing, calcium, chloride, carbon, dioxide, and, water, many, chemical, reactions, involving, hydrochloric, acid, are, applied, in, the, production, of, food, food, ingredients, and, food, additives, typical, products, include, aspartame, fructose, citric, acid, lysine, hydrolyzed, vegetable, protein, as, food, enhancer, and, in, gelatin, production, food, grade, extra, pure, hydrochloric, acid, can, be, applied, when, needed, for, the, final, product, gastric, acid, is, one, of, the, main, secretions, of, the, stomach, it, consists, mainly, of, hydrochloric, acid, and, acidifies, the, stomach, content, to, a, ph, of, 1, to, 2, chloride, cl, and, hydrogen, h, ions, are, secreted, separately, in, the, stomach, fundus, region, at, the, top, of, the, stomach, by, parietal, cells, of, the, gastric, mucosa, into, a, secretory, network, called, canaliculi, before, it, enters, the, stomach, lumen, gastric, acid, acts, as, a, barrier, against, microorganisms, to, prevent, infections, and, is, important, for, the, digestion, of, food, its, low, ph, denatures, proteins, and, thereby, makes, them, susceptible, to, degradation, by, digestive, enzymes, such, as, pepsin, the, low, ph, also, activates, the, enzyme, precursor, pepsinogen, into, the, active, enzyme, pepsin, by, self, cleavage, after, leaving, the, stomach, the, hydrochloric, acid, of, the, chyme, is, neutralized, in, the, duodenum, by, bicarbonate, the, stomach, itself, is, protected, from, the, strong, acid, by, the, secretion, of, a, thick, mucus, layer, and, by, secretin, induced, buffering, with, sodium, bicarbonate, heartburn, or, peptic, ulcers, can, develop, when, these, mechanisms, fail, drugs, of, the, antihistaminic, and, proton, pump, inhibitor, classes, can, inhibit, the, production, of, acid, in, the, stomach, and, antacids, are, used, to, neutralize, excessive, existing, acid, hydrochloric, acid, is, also, used, by, osteoclasts, alongside, proteases, for, bone, resorption, being, a, strong, acid, hydrochloric, acid, is, corrosive, to, living, tissue, and, to, many, materials, but, not, to, rubber, typically, rubber, protective, gloves, and, related, protective, gear, are, used, when, handling, concentrated, solutions, vapors, or, mists, are, a, respiratory, hazard, which, can, be, partially, mitigated, by, use, of, a, respirator, equipped, with, cartridges, specifically, designed, to, capture, hydrochloric, acid, airborne, acid, is, an, irritant, to, the, eyes, and, may, require, the, use, of, protective, goggles, or, a, facemask, hydrochloric, acid, has, been, listed, as, a, table, ii, precursor, under, the, 1988, united, nations, convention, against, illicit, traffic, in, narcotic, drugs, and, psychotropic, substances, because, of, its, use, in, the, production, of, heroin, cocaine, and, methamphetamine
