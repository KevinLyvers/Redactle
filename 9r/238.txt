a, dwarf, planet, is, a, small, planetary, mass, object, that, is, in, direct, orbit, around, the, sun, massive, enough, to, be, gravitationally, rounded, but, insufficient, to, achieve, orbital, dominance, like, the, eight, classical, planets, of, the, solar, system, the, prototypical, dwarf, planet, is, pluto, which, for, decades, was, regarded, as, a, planet, before, the, dwarf, concept, was, adopted, in, 2006, dwarf, planets, are, capable, of, being, geologically, active, an, expectation, that, was, borne, out, in, 2015, by, the, dawn, mission, to, ceres, and, the, new, horizons, mission, to, pluto, planetary, geologists, are, therefore, particularly, interested, in, them, astronomers, are, in, general, agreement, that, at, least, the, nine, largest, candidates, are, dwarf, planets, in, rough, order, of, size, pluto, eris, haumea, makemake, gonggong, quaoar, ceres, orcus, and, sedna, considerable, uncertainty, remains, over, the, tenth, largest, candidate, salacia, which, may, thus, be, considered, a, borderline, case, of, these, ten, two, have, been, visited, by, spacecraft, pluto, and, ceres, and, seven, others, have, at, least, one, known, moon, eris, haumea, makemake, gonggong, quaoar, orcus, and, salacia, which, allows, their, masses, and, thus, an, estimate, of, their, densities, to, be, determined, mass, and, density, in, turn, can, be, fit, into, geophysical, models, in, an, attempt, to, determine, the, nature, of, these, worlds, only, one, sedna, has, neither, been, visited, nor, has, any, known, moons, making, an, accurate, estimate, of, mass, difficult, some, astronomers, include, many, smaller, bodies, as, well, but, there, is, no, consensus, that, these, are, likely, to, be, dwarf, planets, the, term, dwarf, planet, was, coined, by, planetary, scientist, alan, stern, as, part, of, a, three, way, categorization, of, planetary, mass, objects, in, the, solar, system, classical, planets, dwarf, planets, and, satellite, planets, dwarf, planets, were, thus, conceived, of, as, a, category, of, planet, in, 2006, however, the, concept, was, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, as, a, category, of, sub, planetary, objects, part, of, a, three, way, recategorization, of, bodies, orbiting, the, sun, planets, dwarf, planets, and, small, solar, system, bodies, thus, stern, and, other, planetary, geologists, consider, dwarf, planets, and, large, satellites, to, be, planets, but, since, 2006, the, iau, and, perhaps, the, majority, of, astronomers, have, excluded, them, from, the, roster, of, planets, starting, in, 1801, astronomers, discovered, ceres, and, other, bodies, between, mars, and, jupiter, that, for, decades, were, considered, to, be, planets, between, then, and, around, 1851, when, the, number, of, planets, had, reached, 23, astronomers, started, using, the, word, asteroid, from, greek, meaning, star, like, or, star, shaped, for, the, smaller, bodies, and, began, to, distinguish, them, as, minor, planets, rather, than, major, planets, with, the, discovery, of, pluto, in, 1930, most, astronomers, considered, the, solar, system, to, have, nine, major, planets, along, with, thousands, of, significantly, smaller, bodies, asteroids, and, comets, for, almost, 50, years, pluto, was, thought, to, be, larger, than, mercury, but, with, the, discovery, in, 1978, of, pluto, s, moon, charon, it, became, possible, to, measure, pluto, s, mass, accurately, and, to, determine, that, it, was, much, smaller, than, initial, estimates, it, was, roughly, one, twentieth, the, mass, of, mercury, which, made, pluto, by, far, the, smallest, planet, although, it, was, still, more, than, ten, times, as, massive, as, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, ceres, it, had, only, one, fifth, the, mass, of, earth, s, moon, furthermore, having, some, unusual, characteristics, such, as, large, orbital, eccentricity, and, a, high, orbital, inclination, it, became, evident, that, it, was, a, different, kind, of, body, from, any, of, the, other, planets, in, the, 1990s, astronomers, began, to, find, objects, in, the, same, region, of, space, as, pluto, now, known, as, the, kuiper, belt, and, some, even, farther, away, many, of, these, shared, several, of, pluto, s, key, orbital, characteristics, and, pluto, started, being, seen, as, the, largest, member, of, a, new, class, of, objects, the, plutinos, it, became, clear, that, either, the, larger, of, these, bodies, would, also, have, to, be, classified, as, planets, or, pluto, would, have, to, be, reclassified, much, as, ceres, had, been, reclassified, after, the, discovery, of, additional, asteroids, this, led, some, astronomers, to, stop, referring, to, pluto, as, a, planet, several, terms, including, subplanet, and, planetoid, started, to, be, used, for, the, bodies, now, known, as, dwarf, planets, astronomers, were, also, confident, that, more, objects, as, large, as, pluto, would, be, discovered, and, the, number, of, planets, would, start, growing, quickly, if, pluto, were, to, remain, classified, as, a, planet, eris, then, known, as, 2003, ub, 313, was, discovered, in, january, 2005, it, was, thought, to, be, slightly, larger, than, pluto, and, some, reports, informally, referred, to, it, as, the, tenth, planet, as, a, consequence, the, issue, became, a, matter, of, intense, debate, during, the, iau, general, assembly, in, august, 2006, the, iau, s, initial, draft, proposal, included, charon, eris, and, ceres, in, the, list, of, planets, after, many, astronomers, objected, to, this, proposal, an, alternative, was, drawn, up, by, the, uruguayan, astronomers, julio, ngel, fern, ndez, and, gonzalo, tancredi, they, proposed, an, intermediate, category, for, objects, large, enough, to, be, round, but, that, had, not, cleared, their, orbits, of, planetesimals, beside, dropping, charon, from, the, list, the, new, proposal, also, removed, pluto, ceres, and, eris, because, they, have, not, cleared, their, orbits, although, concerns, were, raised, about, the, classification, of, planets, orbiting, other, stars, the, issue, was, not, resolved, it, was, proposed, instead, to, decide, this, only, when, dwarf, planet, size, objects, start, to, be, observed, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, iau, definition, of, dwarf, planet, some, scientists, expressed, their, disagreement, with, the, iau, resolution, campaigns, included, car, bumper, stickers, and, t, shirts, mike, brown, the, discoverer, of, eris, agrees, with, the, reduction, of, the, number, of, planets, to, eight, nasa, announced, in, 2006, that, it, would, use, the, new, guidelines, established, by, the, iau, alan, stern, the, director, of, nasa, s, mission, to, pluto, rejects, the, current, iau, definition, of, planet, both, in, terms, of, defining, dwarf, planets, as, something, other, than, a, type, of, planet, and, in, using, orbital, characteristics, rather, than, intrinsic, characteristics, of, objects, to, define, them, as, dwarf, planets, thus, in, 2011, he, still, referred, to, pluto, as, a, planet, and, accepted, other, likely, dwarf, planets, such, as, ceres, and, eris, as, well, as, the, larger, moons, as, additional, planets, several, years, before, the, iau, definition, he, used, orbital, characteristics, to, separate, berplanets, the, dominant, eight, from, unterplanets, the, dwarf, planets, considering, both, types, planets, names, for, large, subplanetary, bodies, include, dwarf, planet, planetoid, more, general, term, meso, planet, narrowly, used, for, sizes, between, mercury, and, ceres, quasi, planet, and, in, the, transneptunian, region, plutoid, dwarf, planet, however, was, originally, coined, as, a, term, for, the, smallest, planets, not, the, largest, sub, planets, and, is, still, used, that, way, by, many, planetary, astronomers, alan, stern, coined, the, term, dwarf, planet, analogous, to, the, term, dwarf, star, as, part, of, a, three, fold, classification, of, planets, and, he, and, many, of, his, colleagues, continue, to, classify, dwarf, planets, as, a, class, of, planets, the, iau, decided, that, dwarf, planets, are, not, to, be, considered, planets, but, kept, stern, s, term, for, them, other, terms, for, the, iau, definition, of, the, largest, subplanetary, bodies, that, do, not, have, such, conflicting, connotations, or, usage, include, quasi, planet, and, the, older, term, planetoid, having, the, form, of, a, planet, michael, e, brown, stated, that, planetoid, is, a, perfectly, good, word, that, has, been, used, for, these, bodies, for, years, and, that, the, use, of, the, term, dwarf, planet, for, a, non, planet, is, dumb, but, that, it, was, motivated, by, an, attempt, by, the, iau, division, iii, plenary, session, to, reinstate, pluto, as, a, planet, in, a, second, resolution, indeed, the, draft, of, resolution, 5a, had, called, these, median, bodies, planetoids, but, the, plenary, session, voted, unanimously, to, change, the, name, to, dwarf, planet, the, second, resolution, 5b, defined, dwarf, planets, as, a, subtype, of, planet, as, stern, had, originally, intended, distinguished, from, the, other, eight, that, were, to, be, called, classical, planets, under, this, arrangement, the, twelve, planets, of, the, rejected, proposal, were, to, be, preserved, in, a, distinction, between, eight, classical, planets, and, four, dwarf, planets, resolution, 5b, was, defeated, in, the, same, session, that, 5a, was, passed, because, of, the, semantic, inconsistency, of, a, dwarf, planet, not, being, a, planet, due, to, the, failure, of, resolution, 5b, alternative, terms, such, as, nanoplanet, and, subplanet, were, discussed, but, there, was, no, consensus, among, the, csbn, to, change, it, in, most, languages, equivalent, terms, have, been, created, by, translating, dwarf, planet, more, or, less, literally, french, plan, te, naine, spanish, planeta, enano, german, zwergplanet, russian, karlikovaya, planeta, arabic, kaukab, qazm, chinese, ix, ngx, ng, korean, waesohangseong, or, waehangseong, but, in, japanese, they, are, called, junwakusei, meaning, quasi, planets, or, peneplanets, pene, meaning, almost, iau, resolution, 6a, of, 2006, recognizes, pluto, as, the, prototype, of, a, new, category, of, trans, neptunian, objects, the, name, and, precise, nature, of, this, category, were, not, specified, but, left, for, the, iau, to, establish, at, a, later, date, in, the, debate, leading, up, to, the, resolution, the, members, of, the, category, were, variously, referred, to, as, plutons, and, plutonian, objects, but, neither, name, was, carried, forward, perhaps, due, to, objections, from, geologists, that, this, would, create, confusion, with, their, pluton, on, june, 11, 2008, the, iau, executive, committee, announced, a, new, term, plutoid, and, a, definition, all, trans, neptunian, dwarf, planets, are, plutoids, other, departments, of, the, iau, have, rejected, the, term, in, part, because, of, an, email, miscommunication, the, wg, psn, was, not, involved, in, choosing, the, word, plutoid, in, fact, a, vote, taken, by, the, wg, psn, subsequent, to, the, executive, committee, meeting, has, rejected, the, use, of, that, specific, term, the, category, of, plutoid, captured, an, earlier, distinction, between, the, terrestrial, dwarf, ceres, and, the, ice, dwarfs, of, the, outer, solar, system, part, of, a, conception, of, a, threefold, division, of, the, solar, system, into, inner, terrestrial, planets, central, giant, planets, and, outer, ice, dwarfs, of, which, pluto, was, the, principal, member, ice, dwarf, also, saw, some, use, as, an, umbrella, term, for, all, trans, neptunian, minor, planets, or, for, the, ice, asteroids, of, the, outer, solar, system, one, attempted, definition, was, that, an, ice, dwarf, is, larger, than, the, nucleus, of, a, normal, comet, and, icier, than, a, typical, asteroid, since, the, dawn, mission, it, has, been, recognized, that, ceres, is, a, geologically, icy, body, that, may, have, originated, from, the, outer, solar, system, ceres, has, since, been, called, an, ice, dwarf, as, well, planetary, discriminants, of, the, planets, white, and, of, the, largest, known, dwarf, planet, light, purple, in, each, orbital, population, asteroid, belt, kuiper, belt, scattered, disc, sednoids, all, other, known, objects, in, these, populations, have, smaller, discriminants, than, the, one, shown, the, category, dwarf, planet, arose, from, a, conflict, between, dynamical, and, geophysical, ideas, of, what, a, useful, conception, of, a, planet, would, be, in, terms, of, the, dynamics, of, the, solar, system, the, major, distinction, is, between, bodies, that, gravitationally, dominate, their, neighbourhood, mercury, through, neptune, and, those, that, do, not, such, as, the, asteroids, and, kuiper, belt, objects, a, celestial, body, may, have, a, dynamic, planetary, geology, at, approximately, the, mass, required, for, its, mantle, to, become, plastic, under, its, own, weight, which, results, in, the, body, acquiring, a, round, shape, because, this, requires, a, much, lower, mass, than, gravitationally, dominating, the, region, of, space, near, their, orbit, there, are, a, population, of, objects, that, are, massive, enough, to, have, a, world, like, appearance, and, planetary, geology, but, not, massive, enough, to, clear, their, neighborhood, examples, are, ceres, in, the, asteroid, belt, and, pluto, in, the, kuiper, belt, dynamicists, usually, prefer, using, gravitational, dominance, as, the, threshold, for, planethood, because, from, their, perspective, smaller, bodies, are, better, grouped, with, their, neighbours, e, g, ceres, as, simply, a, large, asteroid, and, pluto, as, a, large, kuiper, belt, object, geoscientists, usually, prefer, roundness, as, the, threshold, because, from, their, perspective, the, internally, driven, geology, of, a, body, like, ceres, makes, it, more, similar, to, a, classical, planet, like, mars, than, to, a, small, asteroid, that, lacks, internally, driven, geology, this, necessitated, the, creation, of, the, category, of, dwarf, planets, to, describe, this, intermediate, class, alan, stern, and, harold, f, levison, introduced, a, parameter, upper, case, lambda, in, 2000, expressing, the, likelihood, of, an, encounter, resulting, in, a, given, deflection, of, orbit, the, value, of, this, parameter, in, stern, s, model, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, mass, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, period, this, value, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, capacity, of, a, body, to, clear, the, neighbourhood, of, its, orbit, where, 1, will, eventually, clear, it, a, gap, of, five, orders, of, magnitude, in, was, found, between, the, smallest, terrestrial, planets, and, the, largest, asteroids, and, kuiper, belt, objects, using, this, parameter, steven, soter, and, other, astronomers, argued, for, a, distinction, between, planets, and, dwarf, planets, based, on, the, inability, of, the, latter, to, clear, the, neighbourhood, around, their, orbits, planets, are, able, to, remove, smaller, bodies, near, their, orbits, by, collision, capture, or, gravitational, disturbance, or, establish, orbital, resonances, that, prevent, collisions, whereas, dwarf, planets, lack, the, mass, to, do, so, soter, went, on, to, propose, a, parameter, he, called, the, planetary, discriminant, designated, with, the, symbol, mu, that, represents, an, experimental, measure, of, the, actual, degree, of, cleanliness, of, the, orbital, zone, where, is, calculated, by, dividing, the, mass, of, the, candidate, body, by, the, total, mass, of, the, other, objects, that, share, its, orbital, zone, where, 100, is, deemed, to, be, cleared, jean, luc, margot, refined, stern, and, levison, s, concept, to, produce, a, similar, parameter, upper, case, pi, it, is, based, on, theory, avoiding, the, empirical, data, used, by, 1, indicates, a, planet, and, there, is, again, a, gap, of, several, orders, of, magnitude, between, planets, and, dwarf, planets, there, are, several, other, schemes, that, try, to, differentiate, between, planets, and, dwarf, planets, but, the, 2006, definition, uses, this, concept, enough, internal, pressure, caused, by, the, body, s, gravitation, will, turn, a, body, plastic, and, enough, plasticity, will, allow, high, elevations, to, sink, and, hollows, to, fill, in, a, process, known, as, gravitational, relaxation, bodies, smaller, than, a, few, kilometers, are, dominated, by, non, gravitational, forces, and, tend, to, have, an, irregular, shape, and, may, be, rubble, piles, larger, objects, where, gravity, is, significant, but, not, dominant, are, potato, shaped, the, more, massive, the, body, the, higher, its, internal, pressure, the, more, solid, it, is, and, the, more, rounded, its, shape, until, the, pressure, is, enough, to, overcome, its, compressive, strength, and, it, achieves, hydrostatic, equilibrium, then, a, body, is, as, round, as, it, is, possible, to, be, given, its, rotation, and, tidal, effects, and, is, an, ellipsoid, in, shape, this, is, the, defining, limit, of, a, dwarf, planet, if, an, object, is, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, a, global, layer, of, liquid, on, its, surface, would, form, a, surface, of, the, same, shape, as, the, body, apart, from, small, scale, surface, features, such, as, craters, and, fissures, the, body, will, have, a, spherical, shape, if, it, does, not, rotate, and, an, ellipsoidal, one, if, it, does, the, faster, it, rotates, the, more, oblate, or, even, scalene, it, becomes, if, such, a, rotating, body, were, heated, until, it, melts, its, shape, would, not, change, the, extreme, example, of, a, body, that, may, be, scalene, due, to, rapid, rotation, is, haumea, which, is, twice, as, long, on, its, major, axis, as, it, is, at, the, poles, if, the, body, has, a, massive, nearby, companion, then, tidal, forces, gradually, slow, its, rotation, until, it, is, tidally, locked, that, is, it, always, presents, the, same, face, to, its, companion, tidally, locked, bodies, are, also, scalene, though, sometimes, only, slightly, so, earth, s, moon, is, tidally, locked, as, are, all, the, rounded, satellites, of, the, gas, giants, pluto, and, charon, are, tidally, locked, to, each, other, as, are, eris, and, dysnomia, and, probably, also, orcus, and, vanth, there, are, no, specific, size, or, mass, limits, of, dwarf, planets, as, those, are, not, defining, features, there, is, no, clear, upper, limit, an, object, very, far, out, in, the, solar, system, that, is, more, massive, than, mercury, might, not, have, had, time, to, clear, its, neighbourhood, and, such, a, body, would, fit, the, definition, of, dwarf, planet, rather, than, planet, indeed, mike, brown, set, out, to, find, such, an, object, the, lower, limit, is, determined, by, the, requirements, of, achieving, and, retaining, hydrostatic, equilibrium, but, the, size, or, mass, at, which, an, object, attains, and, retains, equilibrium, depends, on, its, composition, and, thermal, history, not, simply, its, mass, an, iau, 2006, press, release, question, and, answer, section, estimated, that, objects, with, mass, above, 0, 5, 10, 21, kg, and, radius, greater, than, 400, km, would, normally, be, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, shape, would, normally, be, determined, by, self, gravity, but, that, all, borderline, cases, would, need, to, be, determined, by, observation, this, is, close, to, what, as, of, 2019, is, believed, to, be, roughly, the, limit, for, objects, beyond, neptune, that, are, fully, compact, solid, bodies, with, salacia, r, 423, 11, km, m, 0, 492, 0, 007, 10, 21, kg, being, a, borderline, case, both, for, the, 2006, q, a, expectations, and, in, more, recent, evaluations, and, with, orcus, being, just, above, the, expected, limit, no, other, body, with, a, measured, mass, is, close, to, the, expected, mass, limit, though, several, without, a, measured, mass, approach, the, expected, size, limit, though, the, definition, of, a, dwarf, planet, is, clear, evidence, about, whether, a, given, trans, neptunian, object, is, large, and, malleable, enough, to, be, shaped, by, its, own, gravitational, field, is, often, inconclusive, there, are, also, outstanding, questions, relating, to, the, interpretation, of, the, iau, criterion, in, certain, instances, consequently, the, number, of, currently, conformed, tnos, which, meet, the, hydrostatic, equilibrium, criterion, is, uncertain, the, three, objects, under, consideration, during, the, debates, leading, up, to, the, 2006, iau, acceptance, of, the, category, of, dwarf, planet, ceres, pluto, and, eris, are, generally, accepted, as, dwarf, planets, including, by, those, astronomers, who, continue, to, classify, dwarf, planets, as, planets, only, one, of, them, pluto, has, been, observed, in, enough, detail, to, verify, that, its, current, shape, fits, what, would, be, expected, from, hydrostatic, equilibrium, ceres, is, close, to, equilibrium, but, some, gravitational, anomalies, remain, unexplained, eris, is, generally, assumed, to, be, a, dwarf, planet, because, it, is, more, massive, than, pluto, in, order, of, discovery, these, three, bodies, are, the, iau, only, established, guidelines, for, which, committee, would, oversee, the, naming, of, likely, dwarf, planets, any, unnamed, trans, neptunian, object, with, an, absolute, magnitude, brighter, than, 1, and, hence, a, minimum, diameter, of, 838, km, at, the, maximum, geometric, albedo, of, 1, was, to, be, named, by, a, joint, committee, consisting, of, the, minor, planet, center, and, the, planetary, working, group, of, the, iau, at, the, time, and, still, as, of, 2023, the, only, bodies, to, meet, this, threshold, were, haumea, and, makemake, these, bodies, are, generally, assumed, to, be, dwarf, planets, although, they, have, not, yet, been, demonstrated, to, be, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, and, there, is, some, disagreement, for, haumea, these, five, bodies, the, three, under, consideration, in, 2006, pluto, ceres, and, eris, plus, the, two, named, in, 2008, haumea, and, makemake, are, commonly, presented, as, the, dwarf, planets, of, the, solar, system, though, the, limiting, factor, albedo, is, not, what, defines, an, object, as, a, dwarf, planet, the, astronomical, community, commonly, refers, to, other, larger, tnos, as, dwarf, planets, as, well, at, least, four, additional, bodies, meet, the, preliminary, criteria, of, brown, of, tancredi, et, al, of, grundy, et, al, and, of, emery, et, al, for, identifying, dwarf, planets, and, are, generally, called, dwarf, planets, by, astronomers, as, well, for, instance, jpl, nasa, called, gonggong, a, dwarf, planet, after, observations, in, 2016, and, simon, porter, of, the, southwest, research, institute, spoke, of, the, big, eight, dwarf, planets, in, 2018, referring, to, pluto, eris, haumea, makemake, gonggong, quaoar, sedna, and, orcus, the, iau, itself, has, called, quaoar, a, dwarf, planet, in, a, 2022, 2023, annual, report, more, bodies, have, been, proposed, such, as, salacia, and, 307261, 2002, ms, 4, by, brown, varuna, and, ixion, by, tancredi, et, al, and, 532037, 2013, fy, 27, by, sheppard, et, al, most, of, the, larger, bodies, have, moons, which, enables, a, determination, of, their, mass, and, thus, their, density, which, inform, estimates, of, whether, they, could, be, dwarf, planets, the, largest, tnos, that, are, not, known, to, have, moons, are, sedna, 307261, 2002, ms, 4, 55565, 2002, aw, 197, and, ixion, in, particular, salacia, has, a, known, mass, and, diameter, putting, it, as, a, borderline, case, by, the, iau, s, 2006, q, a, at, the, time, makemake, and, haumea, were, named, it, was, thought, that, trans, neptunian, objects, tnos, with, icy, cores, would, require, a, diameter, of, only, about, 400, km, 250, mi, or, 3, the, size, of, earth, the, size, of, the, moons, mimas, the, smallest, moon, that, is, round, and, proteus, the, largest, that, is, not, to, relax, into, gravitational, equilibrium, researchers, thought, that, the, number, of, such, bodies, could, prove, to, be, around, 200, in, the, kuiper, belt, with, thousands, more, beyond, this, was, one, of, the, reasons, keeping, the, roster, of, planets, to, a, reasonable, number, that, pluto, was, reclassified, in, the, first, place, research, since, then, has, cast, doubt, on, the, idea, that, bodies, that, small, could, have, achieved, or, maintained, equilibrium, under, the, typical, conditions, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, beyond, individual, astronomers, have, recognized, a, number, of, objects, as, dwarf, planets, or, as, likely, to, prove, to, be, dwarf, planets, in, 2008, tancredi, et, al, advised, the, iau, to, officially, accept, orcus, sedna, and, quaoar, as, dwarf, planets, gonggong, was, not, yet, known, though, the, iau, did, not, address, the, issue, then, and, has, not, since, tancredi, also, considered, the, five, tnos, varuna, ixion, 2003, az, 84, 2004, gv, 9, and, 2002, aw, 197, to, most, likely, be, dwarf, planets, as, well, since, 2011, brown, has, maintained, a, list, of, hundreds, of, candidate, objects, ranging, from, nearly, certain, to, possible, dwarf, planets, based, solely, on, estimated, size, as, of, september, 13, 2019, brown, s, list, identifies, ten, trans, neptunian, objects, with, diameters, then, thought, to, be, greater, than, 900, km, the, four, named, by, the, iau, plus, gonggong, quaoar, sedna, orcus, 307261, 2002, ms, 4, and, salacia, as, near, certain, to, be, dwarf, planets, and, another, 16, with, diameter, greater, than, 600, km, as, highly, likely, notably, gonggong, may, have, a, larger, diameter, 1230, 50, km, than, pluto, s, round, moon, charon, 1212, km, but, in, 2019, grundy, et, al, proposed, based, on, their, studies, of, g, k, n, h, md, m, that, dark, low, density, bodies, smaller, than, about, 900, 1000, km, in, diameter, such, as, salacia, and, varda, never, fully, collapsed, into, solid, planetary, bodies, and, retain, internal, porosity, from, their, formation, in, which, case, they, could, not, be, dwarf, planets, they, accept, that, brighter, albedo, 0, 2, or, denser, 1, 4, g, cc, orcus, and, quaoar, probably, were, fully, solid, orcus, and, charon, probably, melted, and, differentiated, considering, their, higher, densities, and, spectra, indicating, surfaces, made, of, relatively, clean, h, 2, o, ice, but, the, lower, albedos, and, densities, of, g, k, n, h, md, m, 55637, varda, and, salacia, suggest, that, they, never, did, differentiate, or, if, they, did, it, was, only, in, their, deep, interiors, not, a, complete, melting, and, overturning, that, involved, the, surface, their, surfaces, could, remain, quite, cold, and, uncompressed, even, as, the, interior, becomes, warm, and, collapses, the, liberation, of, volatiles, could, further, help, transport, heat, out, of, their, interiors, limiting, the, extent, of, their, internal, collapse, an, object, with, a, cold, relatively, pristine, surface, and, a, partially, collapsed, interior, should, exhibit, very, distinctive, surface, geology, with, abundant, thrust, faults, indicative, of, the, reduction, in, total, surface, area, as, the, interior, compresses, and, shrinks, salacia, was, later, found, to, have, a, somewhat, higher, density, comparable, within, uncertainties, to, that, of, orcus, though, still, with, a, very, dark, surface, despite, this, determination, grundy, et, al, call, it, dwarf, planet, sized, while, calling, orcus, a, dwarf, planet, later, studies, on, varda, suggest, that, its, density, may, also, be, high, though, a, low, density, could, not, be, excluded, in, 2023, emery, et, al, wrote, that, near, infrared, spectroscopy, by, the, james, webb, space, telescope, jwst, in, 2022, suggests, that, sedna, gonggong, and, quaoar, underwent, internal, melting, differentiation, and, chemical, evolution, like, the, larger, dwarf, planets, pluto, eris, haumea, and, makemake, but, unlike, all, smaller, kbos, this, is, because, light, hydrocarbons, are, present, on, their, surfaces, e, g, ethane, acetylene, and, ethylene, which, implies, that, methane, is, continuously, being, resupplied, and, that, methane, would, likely, come, from, internal, geochemistry, on, the, other, hand, the, surfaces, of, sedna, gonggong, and, quaoar, have, low, abundances, of, co, and, co, 2, similar, to, pluto, eris, and, makemake, but, in, contrast, to, smaller, bodies, this, suggests, that, the, threshold, for, dwarf, planethood, in, the, trans, neptunian, region, is, a, diameter, of, 900, km, thus, including, only, pluto, eris, haumea, makemake, gonggong, quaoar, orcus, and, sedna, and, that, even, salacia, may, not, be, a, dwarf, planet, a, 2023, study, of, 307261, 2002, ms, 4, shows, that, it, probably, has, an, extremely, large, crater, whose, depth, takes, up, 5, 7, of, its, diameter, this, is, proportionally, larger, than, the, rheasilvia, crater, on, vesta, which, is, the, reason, vesta, is, not, usually, considered, a, dwarf, planet, today, in, 2024, kiss, et, al, found, that, quaoar, has, an, ellipsoidal, shape, incompatible, with, hydrostatic, equilibrium, for, its, current, spin, they, hypothesised, that, quaoar, originally, had, a, rapid, rotation, and, was, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, but, that, its, shape, became, frozen, in, and, did, not, change, as, it, spun, down, due, to, tidal, forces, from, its, moon, weywot, if, so, this, would, resemble, the, situation, of, saturn, s, moon, iapetus, which, is, too, oblate, for, its, current, spin, iapetus, is, generally, still, considered, a, planetary, mass, moon, nonetheless, though, not, always, the, trans, neptunian, objects, in, the, following, tables, except, salacia, are, agreed, by, brown, tancredi, et, al, grundy, et, al, and, emery, et, al, to, be, probable, dwarf, planets, or, close, to, it, salacia, has, been, included, as, the, largest, tno, not, generally, agreed, to, be, a, dwarf, planet, it, is, a, borderline, body, by, many, criteria, and, is, therefore, italicized, charon, a, moon, of, pluto, that, was, proposed, as, a, dwarf, planet, by, the, iau, in, 2006, is, included, for, comparison, those, objects, that, have, absolute, magnitude, greater, than, 1, and, so, meet, the, threshold, of, the, joint, planet, minor, planet, naming, committee, of, the, iau, are, highlighted, as, is, ceres, which, the, iau, has, assumed, is, a, dwarf, planet, since, they, first, debated, the, concept, the, masses, of, given, dwarf, planets, are, listed, for, their, systems, if, they, have, satellites, with, exceptions, for, pluto, and, orcus, ceres, and, pluto, received, planetary, symbols, as, they, were, considered, to, be, planets, when, they, were, discovered, by, the, time, the, others, were, discovered, planetary, symbols, had, mostly, fallen, out, of, use, among, astronomers, unicode, includes, symbols, for, quaoar, sedna, orcus, haumea, eris, makemake, and, gonggong, that, are, primarily, used, by, astrologers, they, were, devised, by, denis, moskowitz, a, software, engineer, in, massachusetts, nasa, has, used, his, haumea, eris, and, makemake, symbols, as, well, as, the, traditional, astrological, symbol, for, pluto, when, referring, to, it, as, a, dwarf, planet, symbols, have, been, proposed, for, the, next, largest, named, candidates, but, do, not, have, consistent, usage, among, astrologers, the, unicode, proposal, for, quaoar, orcus, haumea, makemake, and, gonggong, mentions, the, following, symbols, for, named, objects, over, 600, km, diameter, salacia, varda, ixion, g, k, n, h, md, m, and, varuna, as, of, 2024, only, two, missions, have, targeted, and, explored, dwarf, planets, up, close, on, march, 6, 2015, the, dawn, spacecraft, entered, orbit, around, ceres, becoming, the, first, spacecraft, to, visit, a, dwarf, planet, on, july, 14, 2015, the, new, horizons, space, probe, flew, by, pluto, and, its, five, moons, ceres, displays, such, evidence, of, an, active, geology, as, salt, deposits, and, cryovolcanos, while, pluto, has, water, ice, mountains, drifting, in, nitrogen, ice, glaciers, as, well, as, a, significant, atmosphere, ceres, evidently, has, brine, percolating, through, its, subsurface, while, there, is, evidence, that, pluto, has, an, actual, subsurface, ocean, dawn, had, previously, orbited, the, asteroid, vesta, saturn, s, moon, phoebe, has, been, imaged, by, cassini, and, before, that, by, voyager, 2, which, also, encountered, neptune, s, moon, triton, all, three, bodies, show, evidence, of, once, being, dwarf, planets, and, their, exploration, helps, clarify, the, evolution, of, dwarf, planets, new, horizons, has, captured, distant, images, of, triton, quaoar, haumea, eris, and, makemake, as, well, as, the, smaller, candidates, ixion, 2002, ms, 4, and, 2014, oe, 394, one, of, the, china, national, space, administration, s, two, shensuo, probes, has, been, proposed, to, visit, quaoar, in, 2040, a, number, of, bodies, physically, resemble, dwarf, planets, these, include, former, dwarf, planets, which, may, still, have, equilibrium, shape, or, evidence, of, active, geology, planetary, mass, moons, which, meet, the, physical, but, not, the, orbital, definition, for, dwarf, planet, and, charon, in, the, pluto, charon, system, which, is, arguably, a, binary, dwarf, planet, the, categories, may, overlap, triton, for, example, is, both, a, former, dwarf, planet, and, a, planetary, mass, moon, vesta, the, next, most, massive, body, in, the, asteroid, belt, after, ceres, was, once, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, and, is, roughly, spheroidal, deviating, mainly, due, to, massive, impacts, that, formed, the, rheasilvia, and, veneneia, craters, after, it, solidified, its, dimensions, are, not, consistent, with, it, currently, being, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, triton, is, more, massive, than, eris, or, pluto, has, an, equilibrium, shape, and, is, thought, to, be, a, captured, dwarf, planet, likely, a, member, of, a, binary, system, but, no, longer, directly, orbits, the, sun, phoebe, is, a, captured, centaur, that, like, vesta, is, no, longer, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, but, is, thought, to, have, been, so, early, in, its, history, due, to, radiogenic, heating, at, least, nineteen, moons, have, equilibrium, shape, from, having, relaxed, under, self, gravity, at, some, point, though, some, have, since, frozen, solid, and, are, no, longer, in, equilibrium, seven, are, more, massive, than, either, eris, or, pluto, these, moons, are, not, physically, distinct, from, the, dwarf, planets, but, do, not, fit, the, iau, definition, because, they, do, not, directly, orbit, the, sun, indeed, neptune, s, moon, triton, is, a, captured, dwarf, planet, and, ceres, formed, in, the, same, region, of, the, solar, system, as, the, moons, of, jupiter, and, saturn, alan, stern, calls, planetary, mass, moons, satellite, planets, one, of, three, categories, of, planet, together, with, dwarf, planets, and, classical, planets, the, term, planemo, planetary, mass, object, also, covers, all, three, populations, there, has, been, some, debate, as, to, whether, the, pluto, charon, system, should, be, considered, a, double, dwarf, planet, in, a, draft, resolution, for, the, iau, definition, of, planet, both, pluto, and, charon, were, considered, planets, in, a, binary, system, the, iau, currently, says, charon, is, not, considered, a, dwarf, planet, but, rather, a, satellite, of, pluto, though, the, idea, that, charon, might, qualify, as, a, dwarf, planet, may, be, considered, at, a, later, date, nonetheless, it, is, no, longer, clear, that, charon, is, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, also, the, location, of, the, barycenter, depends, not, only, on, the, relative, masses, of, the, bodies, but, also, on, the, distance, between, them, the, barycenter, of, the, sun, jupiter, orbit, for, example, lies, outside, the, sun, but, they, are, not, considered, a, binary, object, thus, a, formal, definition, of, what, constitutes, a, binary, dwarf, planet, must, be, established, before, pluto, and, charon, are, formally, defined, as, binary, dwarf, planets, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow, may, be, read, as,
