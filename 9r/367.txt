titanium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ti, and, atomic, number, 22, found, in, nature, only, as, an, oxide, it, can, be, reduced, to, produce, a, lustrous, transition, metal, with, a, silver, color, low, density, and, high, strength, resistant, to, corrosion, in, sea, water, aqua, regia, and, chlorine, titanium, was, discovered, in, cornwall, great, britain, by, william, gregor, in, 1791, and, was, named, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, after, the, titans, of, greek, mythology, the, element, occurs, within, a, number, of, minerals, principally, rutile, and, ilmenite, which, are, widely, distributed, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, lithosphere, it, is, found, in, almost, all, living, things, as, well, as, bodies, of, water, rocks, and, soils, the, metal, is, extracted, from, its, principal, mineral, ores, by, the, kroll, and, hunter, processes, the, most, common, compound, titanium, dioxide, is, a, popular, photocatalyst, and, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, white, pigments, other, compounds, include, titanium, tetrachloride, ticl, 4, a, component, of, smoke, screens, and, catalysts, and, titanium, trichloride, ticl, 3, which, is, used, as, a, catalyst, in, the, production, of, polypropylene, titanium, can, be, alloyed, with, iron, aluminium, vanadium, and, molybdenum, among, other, elements, the, resulting, titanium, alloys, are, strong, lightweight, and, versatile, with, applications, including, aerospace, jet, engines, missiles, and, spacecraft, military, industrial, processes, chemicals, and, petrochemicals, desalination, plants, pulp, and, paper, automotive, agriculture, farming, sporting, goods, jewelry, and, consumer, electronics, titanium, is, also, considered, one, of, the, most, biocompatible, metals, leading, to, a, range, of, medical, applications, including, prostheses, orthopedic, implants, dental, implants, and, surgical, instruments, the, two, most, useful, properties, of, the, metal, are, corrosion, resistance, and, strength, to, density, ratio, the, highest, of, any, metallic, element, in, its, unalloyed, condition, titanium, is, as, strong, as, some, steels, but, less, dense, there, are, two, allotropic, forms, and, five, naturally, occurring, isotopes, of, this, element, 46, ti, through, 50, ti, with, 48, ti, being, the, most, abundant, 73, 8, as, a, metal, titanium, is, recognized, for, its, high, strength, to, weight, ratio, it, is, a, strong, metal, with, low, density, that, is, quite, ductile, especially, in, an, oxygen, free, environment, lustrous, and, metallic, white, in, color, due, to, its, relatively, high, melting, point, 1, 668, c, or, 3, 034, f, it, has, sometimes, been, described, as, a, refractory, metal, but, this, is, not, the, case, it, is, paramagnetic, and, has, fairly, low, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, compared, to, other, metals, titanium, is, superconducting, when, cooled, below, its, critical, temperature, of, 0, 49, k, commercially, pure, 99, 2, pure, grades, of, titanium, have, ultimate, tensile, strength, of, about, 434, mpa, 63, 000, psi, equal, to, that, of, common, low, grade, steel, alloys, but, are, less, dense, titanium, is, 60, denser, than, aluminium, but, more, than, twice, as, strong, as, the, most, commonly, used, 6061, t6, aluminium, alloy, certain, titanium, alloys, e, g, beta, c, achieve, tensile, strengths, of, over, 1, 400, mpa, 200, 000, psi, however, titanium, loses, strength, when, heated, above, 430, c, 806, f, titanium, is, not, as, hard, as, some, grades, of, heat, treated, steel, it, is, non, magnetic, and, a, poor, conductor, of, heat, and, electricity, machining, requires, precautions, because, the, material, can, gall, unless, sharp, tools, and, proper, cooling, methods, are, used, like, steel, structures, those, made, from, titanium, have, a, fatigue, limit, that, guarantees, longevity, in, some, applications, the, metal, is, a, dimorphic, allotrope, of, a, hexagonal, form, that, changes, into, a, body, centered, cubic, lattice, form, at, 882, c, 1, 620, f, the, specific, heat, of, the, form, increases, dramatically, as, it, is, heated, to, this, transition, temperature, but, then, falls, and, remains, fairly, constant, for, the, form, regardless, of, temperature, like, aluminium, and, magnesium, the, surface, of, titanium, metal, and, its, alloys, oxidize, immediately, upon, exposure, to, air, to, form, a, thin, non, porous, passivation, layer, that, protects, the, bulk, metal, from, further, oxidation, or, corrosion, when, it, first, forms, this, protective, layer, is, only, 1, 2, nm, thick, but, it, continues, to, grow, slowly, reaching, a, thickness, of, 25, nm, in, four, years, this, layer, gives, titanium, excellent, resistance, to, corrosion, against, oxidizing, acids, but, it, will, dissolve, in, dilute, hydrofluoric, acid, hot, hydrochloric, acid, and, hot, sulfuric, acid, titanium, is, capable, of, withstanding, attack, by, dilute, sulfuric, and, hydrochloric, acids, at, room, temperature, chloride, solutions, and, most, organic, acids, however, titanium, is, corroded, by, concentrated, acids, titanium, is, a, very, reactive, metal, that, burns, in, normal, air, at, lower, temperatures, than, the, melting, point, melting, is, possible, only, in, an, inert, atmosphere, or, vacuum, at, 550, c, 1, 022, f, it, combines, with, chlorine, it, also, reacts, with, the, other, halogens, and, absorbs, hydrogen, titanium, readily, reacts, with, oxygen, at, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, in, air, and, at, 610, c, 1, 130, f, in, pure, oxygen, forming, titanium, dioxide, titanium, is, one, of, the, few, elements, that, burns, in, pure, nitrogen, gas, reacting, at, 800, c, 1, 470, f, to, form, titanium, nitride, which, causes, embrittlement, because, of, its, high, reactivity, with, oxygen, nitrogen, and, many, other, gases, titanium, that, is, evaporated, from, filaments, is, the, basis, for, titanium, sublimation, pumps, in, which, titanium, serves, as, a, scavenger, for, these, gases, by, chemically, binding, to, them, such, pumps, inexpensively, produce, extremely, low, pressures, in, ultra, high, vacuum, systems, titanium, is, the, ninth, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, 0, 63, by, mass, and, the, seventh, most, abundant, metal, it, is, present, as, oxides, in, most, igneous, rocks, in, sediments, derived, from, them, in, living, things, and, natural, bodies, of, water, of, the, 801, types, of, igneous, rocks, analyzed, by, the, united, states, geological, survey, 784, contained, titanium, its, proportion, in, soils, is, approximately, 0, 5, 1, 5, common, titanium, containing, minerals, are, anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and, titanite, sphene, akaogiite, is, an, extremely, rare, mineral, consisting, of, titanium, dioxide, of, these, minerals, only, rutile, and, ilmenite, have, economic, importance, yet, even, they, are, difficult, to, find, in, high, concentrations, about, 6, 0, and, 0, 7, million, tonnes, of, those, minerals, were, mined, in, 2011, respectively, significant, titanium, bearing, ilmenite, deposits, exist, in, australia, canada, china, india, mozambique, new, zealand, norway, sierra, leone, south, africa, and, ukraine, about, 210, 000, tonnes, of, titanium, metal, sponge, were, produced, in, 2020, mostly, in, china, 110, 000,

advantage, of, titanium, compounds, lies, in, their, high, efficacy, and, low, toxicity, in, vivo, in, biological, environments, hydrolysis, leads, to, the, safe, and, inert, titanium, dioxide, despite, these, advantages, the, first, candidate, compounds, failed, clinical, trials, due, to, insufficient, efficacy, to, toxicity, ratios, and, formulation, complications, further, development, resulted, in, the, creation, of, potentially, effective, selective, and, stable, titanium, based, drugs, titanium, was, discovered, in, 1791, by, the, clergyman, and, geologist, william, gregor, as, an, inclusion, of, a, mineral, in, cornwall, great, britain, gregor, recognized, the, presence, of, a, new, element, in, ilmenite, when, he, found, black, sand, by, a, stream, and, noticed, the, sand, was, attracted, by, a, magnet, analyzing, the, sand, he, determined, the, presence, of, two, metal, oxides, iron, oxide, explaining, the, attraction, to, the, magnet, and, 45, 25, of, a, white, metallic, oxide, he, could, not, identify, realizing, that, the, unidentified, oxide, contained, a, metal, that, did, not, match, any, known, element, in, 1791, gregor, reported, his, findings, in, both, german, and, french, science, journals, crell, s, annalen, and, observations, et, m, moires, sur, la, physique, he, named, this, oxide, manaccanite, around, the, same, time, franz, joseph, m, ller, von, reichenstein, produced, a, similar, substance, but, could, not, identify, it, the, oxide, was, independently, rediscovered, in, 1795, by, prussian, chemist, martin, heinrich, klaproth, in, rutile, from, boinik, the, german, name, of, bajm, cska, a, village, in, hungary, now, bojni, ky, in, slovakia, klaproth, found, that, it, contained, a, new, element, and, named, it, for, the, titans, of, greek, mythology, after, hearing, about, gregor, s, earlier, discovery, he, obtained, a, sample, of, manaccanite, and, confirmed, that, it, contained, titanium, the, currently, known, processes, for, extracting, titanium, from, its, various, ores, are, laborious, and, costly, it, is, not, possible, to, reduce, the, ore, by, heating, with, carbon, as, in, iron, smelting, because, titanium, combines, with, the, carbon, to, produce, titanium, carbide, pure, metallic, titanium, 99, 9, was, first, prepared, in, 1910, by, matthew, a, hunter, at, rensselaer, polytechnic, institute, by, heating, ticl, 4, with, sodium, at, 700, 800, c, 1, 292, 1, 472, f, under, great, pressure, in, a, batch, process, known, as, the, hunter, process, titanium, metal, was, not, used, outside, the, laboratory, until, 1932, when, william, justin, kroll, produced, it, by, reducing, titanium, tetrachloride, ticl, 4, with, calcium, eight, years, later, he, refined, this, process, with, magnesium, and, with, sodium, in, what, became, known, as, the, kroll, process, although, research, continues, to, seek, cheaper, and, more, efficient, routes, such, as, the, ffc, cambridge, process, the, kroll, process, is, still, predominantly, used, for, commercial, production, titanium, of, very, high, purity, was, made, in, small, quantities, when, anton, eduard, van, arkel, and, jan, hendrik, de, boer, discovered, the, iodide, process, in, 1925, by, reacting, with, iodine, and, decomposing, the, formed, vapors, over, a, hot, filament, to, pure, metal, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, soviet, union, pioneered, the, use, of, titanium, in, military, and, submarine, applications, alfa, class, and, mike, class, as, part, of, programs, related, to, the, cold, war, starting, in, the, early, 1950s, titanium, came, into, use, extensively, in, military, aviation, particularly, in, high, performance, jets, starting, with, aircraft, such, as, the, f, 100, super, sabre, and, lockheed, a, 12, and, sr, 71, throughout, the, cold, war, period, titanium, was, considered, a, strategic, material, by, the, u, s, government, and, a, large, stockpile, of, titanium, sponge, a, porous, form, of, the, pure, metal, was, maintained, by, the, defense, national, stockpile, center, until, the, stockpile, was, dispersed, in, the, 2000s, as, of, 2021, the, four, leading, producers, of, titanium, sponge, were, china, 52, japan, 24, russia, 16, and, kazakhstan, 7, the, hunter, process, was, the, first, industrial, process, to, produce, pure, metallic, titanium, it, was, invented, in, 1910, by, matthew, a, hunter, a, chemist, born, in, new, zealand, who, worked, in, the, united, states, the, process, involves, reducing, titanium, tetrachloride, ticl, 4, with, sodium, na, in, a, batch, reactor, with, an, inert, atmosphere, at, a, temperature, of, 1, 000, c, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, is, then, used, to, leach, the, salt, from, the, product, the, processing, of, titanium, metal, occurs, in, four, major, steps, reduction, of, titanium, ore, into, sponge, a, porous, form, melting, of, sponge, or, sponge, plus, a, master, alloy, to, form, an, ingot, primary, fabrication, where, an, ingot, is, converted, into, general, mill, products, such, as, billet, bar, plate, sheet, strip, and, tube, and, secondary, fabrication, of, finished, shapes, from, mill, products, because, it, cannot, be, readily, produced, by, reduction, of, titanium, dioxide, titanium, metal, is, obtained, by, reduction, of, titanium, tetrachloride, ticl, 4, with, magnesium, metal, in, the, kroll, process, the, complexity, of, this, batch, production, in, the, kroll, process, explains, the, relatively, high, market, value, of, titanium, despite, the, kroll, process, being, less, expensive, than, the, hunter, process, to, produce, the, ticl, 4, required, by, the, kroll, process, the, dioxide, is, subjected, to, carbothermic, reduction, in, the, presence, of, chlorine, in, this, process, the, chlorine, gas, is, passed, over, a, red, hot, mixture, of, rutile, or, ilmenite, in, the, presence, of, carbon, after, extensive, purification, by, fractional, distillation, the, ticl, 4, is, reduced, with, 800, c, 1, 470, f, molten, magnesium, in, an, argon, atmosphere, the, van, arkel, de, boer, process, was, the, first, semi, industrial, process, for, pure, titanium, it, involves, thermal, decomposition, of, titanium, tetraiodide, titanium, powder, is, manufactured, using, a, flow, production, process, known, as, the, armstrong, process, that, is, similar, to, the, batch, production, hunter, process, a, stream, of, titanium, tetrachloride, gas, is, added, to, a, stream, of, molten, sodium, the, products, sodium, chloride, salt, and, titanium, particles, is, filtered, from, the, extra, sodium, titanium, is, then, separated, from, the, salt, by, water, washing, both, sodium, and, chlorine, are, recycled, to, produce, and, process, more, titanium, tetrachloride, methods, for, electrolytic, production, of, ti, metal, from, tio, 2, using, molten, salt, electrolytes, have, been, researched, and, tested, at, laboratory, and, small, pilot, plant, scales, the, lead, author, of, an, impartial, review, published, in, 2017, considered, his, own, process, ready, for, scaling, up, a, 2023, review, discusses, the, electrochemical, principles, involved, in, the, recovery, of, metals, from, aqueous, solutions, and, fused, salt, electrolytes, with, particular, attention, paid, to, titanium, while, some, metals, such, as, nickel, and, copper, can, be, refined, by, electrowinning, at, room, temperature, titanium, must, be, in, the, molten, state, and, there, is, a, strong, chance, of, attack, of, the, refractory, lining, by, molten, titanium, zhang, et, al, concluded, their, perspective, on, thermochemical, and, electrochemical, processes, for, titanium, metal, production, in, 2017, that, even, though, there, are, strong, interests, in, the, industry, for, finding, a, better, method, to, produce, ti, metal, and, a, large, number, of, new, concepts, and, improvements, have, been, investigated, at, the, laboratory, or, even, at, pilot, plant, scales, there, is, no, new, process, to, date, that, can, replace, the, kroll, process, commercially, the, hydrogen, assisted, magnesiothermic, reduction, hamr, process, uses, titanium, dihydride, all, welding, of, titanium, must, be, done, in, an, inert, atmosphere, of, argon, or, helium, to, shield, it, from, contamination, with, atmospheric, gases, oxygen, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, contamination, causes, a, variety, of, conditions, such, as, embrittlement, which, reduce, the, integrity, of, the, assembly, welds, and, lead, to, joint, failure, titanium, is, very, difficult, to, solder, directly, and, hence, a, solderable, metal, or, alloy, such, as, steel, is, coated, on, titanium, prior, to, soldering, titanium, metal, can, be, machined, with, the, same, equipment, and, the, same, processes, as, stainless, steel, common, titanium, alloys, are, made, by, reduction, for, example, cuprotitanium, rutile, with, copper, added, ferrocarbon, titanium, ilmenite, reduced, with, coke, in, an, electric, furnace, and, manganotitanium, rutile, with, manganese, or, manganese, oxides, are, reduced, about, fifty, grades, of, titanium, alloys, are, designed, and, currently, used, although, only, a, couple, of, dozen, are, readily, available, commercially, the, astm, international, recognizes, 31, grades, of, titanium, metal, and, alloys, of, which, grades, one, through, four, are, commercially, pure, unalloyed, those, four, vary, in, tensile, strength, as, a, function, of, oxygen, content, with, grade, 1, being, the, most, ductile, lowest, tensile, strength, with, an, oxygen, content, of, 0, 18, and, grade, 4, the, least, ductile, highest, tensile, strength, with, an, oxygen, content, of, 0, 40, the, remaining, grades, are, alloys, each, designed, for, specific, properties, of, ductility, strength, hardness, electrical, resistivity, creep, resistance, specific, corrosion, resistance, and, combinations, thereof, in, addition, to, the, astm, specifications, titanium, alloys, are, also, produced, to, meet, aerospace, and, military, specifications, sae, ams, mil, t, iso, standards, and, country, specific, specifications, as, well, as, proprietary, end, user, specifications, for, aerospace, military, medical, and, industrial, applications, commercially, pure, flat, product, sheet, plate, can, be, formed, readily, but, processing, must, take, into, account, of, the, tendency, of, the, metal, to, springback, this, is, especially, true, of, certain, high, strength, alloys, exposure, to, the, oxygen, in, air, at, the, elevated, temperatures, used, in, forging, results, in, formation, of, a, brittle, oxygen, rich, metallic, surface, layer, called, alpha, case, that, worsens, the, fatigue, properties, so, it, must, be, removed, by, milling, etching, or, electrochemical, treatment, the, working, of, titanium, is, very, complicated, and, may, include, friction, welding, cryo, forging, and, vacuum, arc, remelting, titanium, is, used, in, steel, as, an, alloying, element, ferro,

titanium, for, the, metal, s, attractive, color, and, association, with, rocketry, the, guggenheim, museum, bilbao, and, the, cerritos, millennium, library, were, the, first, buildings, in, europe, and, north, america, respectively, to, be, sheathed, in, titanium, panels, titanium, sheathing, was, used, in, the, frederic, c, hamilton, building, in, denver, colorado, because, of, titanium, s, superior, strength, and, light, weight, relative, to, other, metals, steel, stainless, steel, and, aluminium, and, because, of, recent, advances, in, metalworking, techniques, its, use, has, become, more, widespread, in, the, manufacture, of, firearms, primary, uses, include, pistol, frames, and, revolver, cylinders, for, the, same, reasons, it, is, used, in, the, body, of, some, laptop, computers, for, example, in, apple, s, powerbook, g4, in, 2023, apple, launched, the, iphone, 15, pro, which, uses, a, titanium, enclosure, some, upmarket, lightweight, and, corrosion, resistant, tools, such, as, shovels, knife, handles, and, flashlights, are, made, of, titanium, or, titanium, alloys, because, of, its, durability, titanium, has, become, more, popular, for, designer, jewelry, particularly, titanium, rings, its, inertness, makes, it, a, good, choice, for, those, with, allergies, or, those, who, will, be, wearing, the, jewelry, in, environments, such, as, swimming, pools, titanium, is, also, alloyed, with, gold, to, produce, an, alloy, that, can, be, marketed, as, 24, karat, gold, because, the, 1, of, alloyed, ti, is, insufficient, to, require, a, lesser, mark, the, resulting, alloy, is, roughly, the, hardness, of, 14, karat, gold, and, is, more, durable, than, pure, 24, karat, gold, titanium, s, durability, light, weight, and, dent, and, corrosion, resistance, make, it, useful, for, watch, cases, some, artists, work, with, titanium, to, produce, sculptures, decorative, objects, and, furniture, titanium, may, be, anodized, to, vary, the, thickness, of, the, surface, oxide, layer, causing, optical, interference, fringes, and, a, variety, of, bright, colors, with, this, coloration, and, chemical, inertness, titanium, is, a, popular, metal, for, body, piercing, titanium, has, a, minor, use, in, dedicated, non, circulating, coins, and, medals, in, 1999, gibraltar, released, the, world, s, first, titanium, coin, for, the, millennium, celebration, the, gold, coast, titans, an, australian, rugby, league, team, award, a, medal, of, pure, titanium, to, their, player, of, the, year, because, titanium, is, biocompatible, non, toxic, and, not, rejected, by, the, body, it, has, many, medical, uses, including, surgical, implements, and, implants, such, as, hip, balls, and, sockets, joint, replacement, and, dental, implants, that, can, stay, in, place, for, up, to, 20, years, the, titanium, is, often, alloyed, with, about, 4, aluminium, or, 6, al, and, 4, vanadium, titanium, has, the, inherent, ability, to, osseointegrate, enabling, use, in, dental, implants, that, can, last, for, over, 30, years, this, property, is, also, useful, for, orthopedic, implant, applications, these, benefit, from, titanium, s, lower, modulus, of, elasticity, young, s, modulus, to, more, closely, match, that, of, the, bone, that, such, devices, are, intended, to, repair, as, a, result, skeletal, loads, are, more, evenly, shared, between, bone, and, implant, leading, to, a, lower, incidence, of, bone, degradation, due, to, stress, shielding, and, periprosthetic, bone, fractures, which, occur, at, the, boundaries, of, orthopedic, implants, however, titanium, alloys, stiffness, is, still, more, than, twice, that, of, bone, so, adjacent, bone, bears, a, greatly, reduced, load, and, may, deteriorate, because, titanium, is, non, ferromagnetic, patients, with, titanium, implants, can, be, safely, examined, with, magnetic, resonance, imaging, convenient, for, long, term, implants, preparing, titanium, for, implantation, in, the, body, involves, subjecting, it, to, a, high, temperature, plasma, arc, which, removes, the, surface, atoms, exposing, fresh, titanium, that, is, instantly, oxidized, modern, advancements, in, additive, manufacturing, techniques, have, increased, potential, for, titanium, use, in, orthopedic, implant, applications, complex, implant, scaffold, designs, can, be, 3d, printed, using, titanium, alloys, which, allows, for, more, patient, specific, applications, and, increased, implant, osseointegration, titanium, is, used, for, the, surgical, instruments, used, in, image, guided, surgery, as, well, as, wheelchairs, crutches, and, any, other, products, where, high, strength, and, low, weight, are, desirable, titanium, dioxide, nanoparticles, are, widely, used, in, electronics, and, the, delivery, of, pharmaceuticals, and, cosmetics, because, of, its, corrosion, resistance, containers, made, of, titanium, have, been, studied, for, the, long, term, storage, of, nuclear, waste, containers, lasting, more, than, 100, 000, years, are, thought, possible, with, manufacturing, conditions, that, minimize, material, defects, a, titanium, drip, shield, could, also, be, installed, over, containers, of, other, types, to, enhance, their, longevity, titanium, is, non, toxic, even, in, large, doses, and, does, not, play, any, natural, role, inside, the, human, body, an, estimated, quantity, of, 0, 8, milligrams, of, titanium, is, ingested, by, humans, each, day, but, most, passes, through, without, being, absorbed, in, the, tissues, it, does, however, sometimes, bio, accumulate, in, tissues, that, contain, silica, one, study, indicates, a, possible, connection, between, titanium, and, yellow, nail, syndrome, as, a, powder, or, in, the, form, of, metal, shavings, titanium, metal, poses, a, significant, fire, hazard, and, when, heated, in, air, an, explosion, hazard, water, and, carbon, dioxide, are, ineffective, for, extinguishing, a, titanium, fire, class, d, dry, powder, agents, must, be, used, instead, when, used, in, the, production, or, handling, of, chlorine, titanium, should, not, be, exposed, to, dry, chlorine, gas, because, it, may, result, in, a, titanium, chlorine, fire, titanium, can, catch, fire, when, a, fresh, non, oxidized, surface, comes, in, contact, with, liquid, oxygen, an, unknown, mechanism, in, plants, may, use, titanium, to, stimulate, the, production, of, carbohydrates, and, encourage, growth, this, may, explain, why, most, plants, contain, about, 1, part, per, million, ppm, of, titanium, food, plants, have, about, 2, ppm, and, horsetail, and, nettle, contain, up, to, 80, ppm
