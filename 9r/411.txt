dysprosium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, dy, and, atomic, number, 66, it, is, a, rare, earth, element, in, the, lanthanide, series, with, a, metallic, silver, luster, dysprosium, is, never, found, in, nature, as, a, free, element, though, like, other, lanthanides, it, is, found, in, various, minerals, such, as, xenotime, naturally, occurring, dysprosium, is, composed, of, seven, isotopes, the, most, abundant, of, which, is, 164, dy, dysprosium, was, first, identified, in, 1886, by, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, but, it, was, not, isolated, in, pure, form, until, the, development, of, ion, exchange, techniques, in, the, 1950s, dysprosium, has, relatively, few, applications, where, it, cannot, be, replaced, by, other, chemical, elements, it, is, used, for, its, high, thermal, neutron, absorption, cross, section, in, making, control, rods, in, nuclear, reactors, for, its, high, magnetic, susceptibility, v, 5, 44, 10, 3, in, data, storage, applications, and, as, a, component, of, terfenol, d, a, magnetostrictive, material, soluble, dysprosium, salts, are, mildly, toxic, while, the, insoluble, salts, are, considered, non, toxic, dysprosium, is, a, rare, earth, element, and, has, a, metallic, bright, silver, luster, it, is, quite, soft, and, can, be, machined, without, sparking, if, overheating, is, avoided, dysprosium, s, physical, characteristics, can, be, greatly, affected, by, even, small, amounts, of, impurities, dysprosium, and, holmium, have, the, highest, magnetic, strengths, of, the, elements, especially, at, low, temperatures, dysprosium, has, a, simple, ferromagnetic, ordering, at, temperatures, below, its, curie, temperature, of, 90, 5, k, 182, 7, c, at, which, point, it, undergoes, a, first, order, phase, transition, from, the, orthorhombic, crystal, structure, to, hexagonal, close, packed, hcp, it, then, has, a, helical, antiferromagnetic, state, in, which, all, of, the, atomic, magnetic, moments, in, a, particular, basal, plane, layer, are, parallel, and, oriented, at, a, fixed, angle, to, the, moments, of, adjacent, layers, this, unusual, antiferromagnetism, transforms, into, a, disordered, paramagnetic, state, at, 179, k, 94, c, it, transforms, from, the, hcp, phase, to, the, body, centered, cubic, phase, at, 1, 654, k, 1, 381, c, dysprosium, metal, retains, its, luster, in, dry, air, but, it, will, tarnish, slowly, in, moist, air, and, it, burns, readily, to, form, dysprosium, iii, oxide, dysprosium, is, quite, electropositive, and, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, dysprosium, hydroxide, dysprosium, hydroxide, decomposes, to, form, dyo, oh, at, elevated, temperatures, which, then, decomposes, again, to, dysprosium, iii, oxide, dysprosium, metal, vigorously, reacts, with, all, the, halogens, at, above, 200, c, dysprosium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, yellow, dy, iii, ions, which, exist, as, a, 3, complex, the, resulting, compound, dysprosium, iii, sulfate, is, noticeably, paramagnetic, dysprosium, halides, such, as, dyf, 3, and, dybr, 3, tend, to, take, on, a, yellow, color, dysprosium, oxide, also, known, as, dysprosia, is, a, white, powder, that, is, highly, magnetic, more, so, than, iron, oxide, dysprosium, combines, with, various, non, metals, at, high, temperatures, to, form, binary, compounds, with, varying, composition, and, oxidation, states, 3, and, sometimes, 2, such, as, dyn, dyp, dyh, 2, and, dyh, 3, dys, dys, 2, dy, 2, s, 3, and, dy, 5, s, 7, dyb, 2, dyb, 4, dyb, 6, and, dyb, 12, as, well, as, dy, 3, c, and, dy, 2, c, 3, dysprosium, carbonate, dy, 2, co, 3, 3, and, dysprosium, sulfate, dy, 2, so, 4, 3, result, from, similar, reactions, most, dysprosium, compounds, are, soluble, in, water, though, dysprosium, carbonate, tetrahydrate, dy, 2, co, 3, 3, 4h, 2, o, and, dysprosium, oxalate, decahydrate, dy, 2, c, 2, o, 4, 3, 10h, 2, o, are, both, insoluble, in, water, two, of, the, most, abundant, dysprosium, carbonates, dy, 2, co, 3, 3, 2, 3h, 2, o, similar, to, the, mineral, tengerite, y, and, dyco, 3, oh, similar, to, minerals, kozoite, la, and, kozoite, nd, are, known, to, form, via, a, poorly, ordered, amorphous, precursor, phase, with, a, formula, of, dy, 2, co, 3, 3, 4h, 2, o, this, amorphous, precursor, consists, of, highly, hydrated, spherical, nanoparticles, of, 10, 20, nm, diameter, that, are, exceptionally, stable, under, dry, treatment, at, ambient, and, high, temperatures, dysprosium, forms, several, intermetallics, including, the, dysprosium, stannides, naturally, occurring, dysprosium, is, composed, of, seven, isotopes, 156, dy, 158, dy, 160, dy, 161, dy, 162, dy, 163, dy, and, 164, dy, these, are, all, considered, stable, although, only, the, last, two, are, theoretically, stable, the, others, can, theoretically, undergo, alpha, decay, of, the, naturally, occurring, isotopes, 164, dy, is, the, most, abundant, at, 28, followed, by, 162, dy, at, 26, the, least, abundant, is, 156, dy, at, 0, 06, dysprosium, is, the, heaviest, element, to, have, isotopes, that, are, predicted, to, be, stable, rather, than, observationally, stable, isotopes, that, are, predicted, to, be, radioactive, twenty, nine, radioisotopes, have, been, synthesized, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 138, to, 173, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 154, dy, with, a, half, life, of, approximately, 3, 10, 6, years, followed, by, 159, dy, with, a, half, life, of, 144, 4, days, the, least, stable, is, 138, dy, with, a, half, life, of, 200, ms, as, a, general, rule, isotopes, that, are, lighter, than, the, stable, isotopes, tend, to, decay, primarily, by, decay, while, those, that, are, heavier, tend, to, decay, by, decay, however, 154, dy, decays, primarily, by, alpha, decay, and, 152, dy, and, 159, dy, decay, primarily, by, electron, capture, dysprosium, also, has, at, least, 11, metastable, isomers, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 140, to, 165, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 165m, dy, which, has, a, half, life, of, 1, 257, minutes, 149, dy, has, two, metastable, isomers, the, second, of, which, 149m2, dy, has, a, half, life, of, 28, ns, in, 1878, erbium, ores, were, found, to, contain, the, oxides, of, holmium, and, thulium, french, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, while, working, with, holmium, oxide, separated, dysprosium, oxide, from, it, in, paris, in, 1886, his, procedure, for, isolating, the, dysprosium, involved, dissolving, dysprosium, oxide, in, acid, then, adding, ammonia, to, precipitate, the, hydroxide, he, was, only, able, to, isolate, dysprosium, from, its, oxide, after, more, than, 30, attempts, at, his, procedure, on, succeeding, he, named, the, element, dysprosium, from, the, greek, dysprositos, meaning, hard, to, get, the, element, was, not, isolated, in, relatively, pure, form, until, after, the, development, of, ion, exchange, techniques, by, frank, spedding, at, iowa, state, university, in, the, early, 1950s, due, to, its, role, in, permanent, magnets, used, for, wind, turbines, it, has, been, argued, that, dysprosium, will, be, one, of, the, main, objects, of, geopolitical, competition, in, a, world, running, on, renewable, energy, but, this, perspective, has, been, criticised, for, failing, to, recognise, that, most, wind, turbines, do, not, use, permanent, magnets, and, for, underestimating, the, power, of, economic, incentives, for, expanded, production, in, 2021, dy, was, turned, into, a, 2, dimensional, supersolid, quantum, gas, while, dysprosium, is, never, encountered, as, a, free, element, it, is, found, in, many, minerals, including, xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite, and, bastn, site, often, with, erbium, and, holmium, or, other, rare, earth, elements, no, dysprosium, dominant, mineral, that, is, with, dysprosium, prevailing, over, other, rare, earths, in, the, composition, has, yet, been, found, in, the, high, yttrium, version, of, these, dysprosium, happens, to, be, the, most, abundant, of, the, heavy, lanthanides, comprising, up, to, 7, 8, of, the, concentrate, as, compared, to, about, 65, for, yttrium, the, concentration, of, dy, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, about, 5, 2, mg, kg, and, in, sea, water, 0, 9, ng, l, dysprosium, is, obtained, primarily, from, monazite, sand, a, mixture, of, various, phosphates, the, metal, is, obtained, as, a, by, product, in, the, commercial, extraction, of, yttrium, in, isolating, dysprosium, most, of, the, unwanted, metals, can, be, removed, magnetically, or, by, a, flotation, process, dysprosium, can, then, be, separated, from, other, rare, earth, metals, by, an, ion, exchange, displacement, process, the, resulting, dysprosium, ions, can, then, react, with, either, fluorine, or, chlorine, to, form, dysprosium, fluoride, dyf, 3, or, dysprosium, chloride, dycl, 3, these, compounds, can, be, reduced, using, either, calcium, or, lithium, metals, in, the, following, reactions, the, components, are, placed, in, a, tantalum, crucible, and, fired, in, a, helium, atmosphere, as, the, reaction, progresses, the, resulting, halide, compounds, and, molten, dysprosium, separate, due, to, differences, in, density, when, the, mixture, cools, the, dysprosium, can, be, cut, away, from, the, impurities, about, 100, tonnes, of, dysprosium, are, produced, worldwide, each, year, with, 99, of, that, total, produced, in, china, dysprosium, prices, have, climbed, nearly, twentyfold, from, 7, per, pound, in, 2003, to, 130, a, pound, in, late, 2010, the, price, increased, to, 1, 400, kg, in, 2011, but, fell, to, 240, in, 2015, largely, due, to, illegal, production, in, china, which, circumvented, government, restrictions, currently, most, dysprosium, is, being, obtained, from, the, ion, adsorption, clay, ores, of, southern, china, as, of, november, 2018, the, browns, range, project, pilot, plant, 160, km, south, east, of, halls, creek, western, australia, is, producing, 50, tonnes, 49, long, tons, per, annum, according, to, the, united, states, department, of, energy, the, wide, range, of, its, current, and, projected, uses, together, with, the, lack, of, any, immediately, suitable, replacement, makes, dysprosium, the, single, most, critical, element, for, emerging, clean, energy, technologies, even, their, most, conservative, projections, predicted, a, shortfall, of, dysprosium, before, 2015, as, of, late, 2015, there, is, a, nascent, rare, earth, including, dysprosium, extraction, industry, in, australia, dysprosium, is, used, in, conjunction, with, vanadium, and, other, elements, in, making, laser, materials, and, commercial, lighting, because, of, dysprosium, s, high, thermal, neutron, absorption, cross, section, dysprosium, oxide, nickel, cermets, are, used, in, neutron, absorbing, control, rods, in, nuclear, reactors, dysprosium, cadmium, chalcogenides, are, sources, of, infrared, radiation, which, is, useful, for, studying, chemical, reactions, because, dysprosium, and, its, compounds, are, highly, susceptible, to, magnetization, they, are, employed, in, various, data, storage, applications, such, as, in, hard, disks, dysprosium, is, increasingly, in, demand, for, the, permanent, magnets, used, in, electric, car, motors, and, wind, turbine, generators, neodymium, iron, boron, magnets, can, have, up, to, 6, of, the, neodymium, substituted, by, dysprosium, to, raise, the, coercivity, for, demanding, applications, such, as, drive, motors, for, electric, vehicles, and, generators, for, wind, turbines, this, substitution, would, require, up, to, 100, grams, of, dysprosium, per, electric, car, produced, based, on, toyota, s, projected, 2, million, units, per, year, the, use, of, dysprosium, in, applications, such, as, this, would, quickly, exhaust, its, available, supply, the, dysprosium, substitution, may, also, be, useful, in, other, applications, because, it, improves, the, corrosion, resistance, of, the, magnets, dysprosium, is, one, of, the, components, of, terfenol, d, along, with, iron, and, terbium, terfenol, d, has, the, highest, room, temperature, magnetostriction, of, any, known, material, which, is, employed, in, transducers, wide, band, mechanical, resonators, and, high, precision, liquid, fuel, injectors, dysprosium, is, used, in, dosimeters, for, measuring, ionizing, radiation, crystals, of, calcium, sulfate, or, calcium, fluoride, are, doped, with, dysprosium, when, these, crystals, are, exposed, to, radiation, the, dysprosium, atoms, become, excited, and, luminescent, the, luminescence, can, be, measured, to, determine, the, degree, of, exposure, to, which, the, dosimeter, has, been, subjected, nanofibers, of, dysprosium, compounds, have, high, strength, and, a, large, surface, area, therefore, they, can, be, used, to, reinforce, other, materials, and, act, as, a, catalyst, fibers, of, dysprosium, oxide, fluoride, can, be, produced, by, heating, an, aqueous, solution, of, dybr, 3, and, naf, to, 450, c, at, 450, bars, for, 17, hours, this, material, is, remarkably, robust, surviving, over, 100, hours, in, various, aqueous, solutions, at, temperatures, exceeding, 400, c, without, redissolving, or, aggregating, additionally, dysprosium, has, been, used, to, create, a, two, dimensional, supersolid, in, a, laboratory, environment, supersolids, are, expected, to, exhibit, unusual, properties, including, superfluidity, dysprosium, iodide, and, dysprosium, bromide, are, used, in, high, intensity, metal, halide, lamps, these, compounds, dissociate, near, the, hot, center, of, the, lamp, releasing, isolated, dysprosium, atoms, the, latter, re, emit, light, in, the, green, and, red, part, of, the, spectrum, thereby, effectively, producing, bright, light, several, paramagnetic, crystal, salts, of, dysprosium, dysprosium, gallium, garnet, dgg, dysprosium, aluminium, garnet, dag, dysprosium, iron, garnet, dyig, are, used, in, adiabatic, demagnetization, refrigerators, the, trivalent, dysprosium,
