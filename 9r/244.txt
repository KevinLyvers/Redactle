a, star, is, a, luminous, spheroid, of, plasma, held, together, by, self, gravity, the, nearest, star, to, earth, is, the, sun, many, other, stars, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, at, night, their, immense, distances, from, earth, make, them, appear, as, fixed, points, of, light, the, most, prominent, stars, have, been, categorised, into, constellations, and, asterisms, and, many, of, the, brightest, stars, have, proper, names, astronomers, have, assembled, star, catalogues, that, identify, the, known, stars, and, provide, standardized, stellar, designations, the, observable, universe, contains, an, estimated, 10, 22, to, 10, 24, stars, only, about, 4, 000, of, these, stars, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, all, within, the, milky, way, galaxy, a, star, s, life, begins, with, the, gravitational, collapse, of, a, gaseous, nebula, of, material, largely, comprising, hydrogen, helium, and, trace, heavier, elements, its, total, mass, mainly, determines, its, evolution, and, eventual, fate, a, star, shines, for, most, of, its, active, life, due, to, the, thermonuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, in, its, core, this, process, releases, energy, that, traverses, the, star, s, interior, and, radiates, into, outer, space, at, the, end, of, a, star, s, lifetime, as, a, fusor, its, core, becomes, a, stellar, remnant, a, white, dwarf, a, neutron, star, or, if, it, is, sufficiently, massive, a, black, hole, stellar, nucleosynthesis, in, stars, or, their, remnants, creates, almost, all, naturally, occurring, chemical, elements, heavier, than, lithium, stellar, mass, loss, or, supernova, explosions, return, chemically, enriched, material, to, the, interstellar, medium, these, elements, are, then, recycled, into, new, stars, astronomers, can, determine, stellar, properties, including, mass, age, metallicity, chemical, composition, variability, distance, and, motion, through, space, by, carrying, out, observations, of, a, star, s, apparent, brightness, spectrum, and, changes, in, its, position, in, the, sky, over, time, stars, can, form, orbital, systems, with, other, astronomical, objects, as, in, planetary, systems, and, star, systems, with, two, or, more, stars, when, two, such, stars, orbit, closely, their, gravitational, interaction, can, significantly, impact, their, evolution, stars, can, form, part, of, a, much, larger, gravitationally, bound, structure, such, as, a, star, cluster, or, a, galaxy, the, word, star, ultimately, derives, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, h, st, r, also, meaning, star, but, further, analyzable, as, h, eh, s, to, burn, also, the, source, of, the, word, ash, t, r, agentive, suffix, compare, latin, stella, greek, aster, german, stern, some, scholars, believe, the, word, is, a, borrowing, from, akkadian, istar, venus, star, is, cognate, shares, the, same, root, with, the, following, words, asterisk, asteroid, astral, constellation, esther, historically, stars, have, been, important, to, civilizations, throughout, the, world, they, have, been, part, of, religious, practices, divination, rituals, mythology, used, for, celestial, navigation, and, orientation, to, mark, the, passage, of, seasons, and, to, define, calendars, early, astronomers, recognized, a, difference, between, fixed, stars, whose, position, on, the, celestial, sphere, does, not, change, and, wandering, stars, planets, which, move, noticeably, relative, to, the, fixed, stars, over, days, or, weeks, many, ancient, astronomers, believed, that, the, stars, were, permanently, affixed, to, a, heavenly, sphere, and, that, they, were, immutable, by, convention, astronomers, grouped, prominent, stars, into, asterisms, and, constellations, and, used, them, to, track, the, motions, of, the, planets, and, the, inferred, position, of, the, sun, the, motion, of, the, sun, against, the, background, stars, and, the, horizon, was, used, to, create, calendars, which, could, be, used, to, regulate, agricultural, practices, the, gregorian, calendar, currently, used, nearly, everywhere, in, the, world, is, a, solar, calendar, based, on, the, angle, of, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, relative, to, its, local, star, the, sun, the, oldest, accurately, dated, star, chart, was, the, result, of, ancient, egyptian, astronomy, in, 1534, bc, the, earliest, known, star, catalogues, were, compiled, by, the, ancient, babylonian, astronomers, of, mesopotamia, in, the, late, 2nd, millennium, bc, during, the, kassite, period, c, 1531, bc, c, 1155, bc, the, first, star, catalogue, in, greek, astronomy, was, created, by, aristillus, in, approximately, 300, bc, with, the, help, of, timocharis, the, star, catalog, of, hipparchus, 2nd, century, bc, included, 1, 020, stars, and, was, used, to, assemble, ptolemy, s, star, catalogue, hipparchus, is, known, for, the, discovery, of, the, first, recorded, nova, new, star, many, of, the, constellations, and, star, names, in, use, today, derive, from, greek, astronomy, despite, the, apparent, immutability, of, the, heavens, chinese, astronomers, were, aware, that, new, stars, could, appear, in, 185, ad, they, were, the, first, to, observe, and, write, about, a, supernova, now, known, as, sn, 185, the, brightest, stellar, event, in, recorded, history, was, the, sn, 1006, supernova, which, was, observed, in, 1006, and, written, about, by, the, egyptian, astronomer, ali, ibn, ridwan, and, several, chinese, astronomers, the, sn, 1054, supernova, which, gave, birth, to, the, crab, nebula, was, also, observed, by, chinese, and, islamic, astronomers, medieval, islamic, astronomers, gave, arabic, names, to, many, stars, that, are, still, used, today, and, they, invented, numerous, astronomical, instruments, that, could, compute, the, positions, of, the, stars, they, built, the, first, large, observatory, research, institutes, mainly, to, produce, zij, star, catalogues, among, these, the, book, of, fixed, stars, 964, was, written, by, the, persian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, who, observed, a, number, of, stars, star, clusters, including, the, omicron, velorum, and, brocchi, s, clusters, and, galaxies, including, the, andromeda, galaxy, according, to, a, zahoor, in, the, 11th, century, the, persian, polymath, scholar, abu, rayhan, biruni, described, the, milky, way, galaxy, as, a, multitude, of, fragments, having, the, properties, of, nebulous, stars, and, gave, the, latitudes, of, various, stars, during, a, lunar, eclipse, in, 1019, according, to, josep, puig, the, andalusian, astronomer, ibn, bajjah, proposed, that, the, milky, way, was, made, up, of, many, stars, that, almost, touched, one, another, and, appeared, to, be, a, continuous, image, due, to, the, effect, of, refraction, from, sublunary, material, citing, his, observation, of, the, conjunction, of, jupiter, and, mars, on, 500, ah, 1106, 1107, ad, as, evidence, early, european, astronomers, such, as, tycho, brahe, identified, new, stars, in, the, night, sky, later, termed, novae, suggesting, that, the, heavens, were, not, immutable, in, 1584, giordano, bruno, suggested, that, the, stars, were, like, the, sun, and, may, have, other, planets, possibly, even, earth, like, in, orbit, around, them, an, idea, that, had, been, suggested, earlier, by, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, democritus, and, epicurus, and, by, medieval, islamic, cosmologists, such, as, fakhr, al, din, al, razi, by, the, following, century, the, idea, of, the, stars, being, the, same, as, the, sun, was, reaching, a, consensus, among, astronomers, to, explain, why, these, stars, exerted, no, net, gravitational, pull, on, the, solar, system, isaac, newton, suggested, that, the, stars, were, equally, distributed, in, every, direction, an, idea, prompted, by, the, theologian, richard, bentley, the, italian, astronomer, geminiano, montanari, recorded, observing, variations, in, luminosity, of, the, star, algol, in, 1667, edmond, halley, published, the, first, measurements, of, the, proper, motion, of, a, pair, of, nearby, fixed, stars, demonstrating, that, they, had, changed, positions, since, the, time, of, the, ancient, greek, astronomers, ptolemy, and, hipparchus, william, herschel, was, the, first, astronomer, to, attempt, to, determine, the, distribution, of, stars, in, the, sky, during, the, 1780s, he, established, a, series, of, gauges, in, 600, directions, and, counted, the, stars, observed, along, each, line, of, sight, from, this, he, deduced, that, the, number, of, stars, steadily, increased, toward, one, side, of, the, sky, in, the, direction, of, the, milky, way, core, his, son, john, herschel, repeated, this, study, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, found, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, same, direction, in, addition, to, his, other, accomplishments, william, herschel, is, noted, for, his, discovery, that, some, stars, do, not, merely, lie, along, the, same, line, of, sight, but, are, physical, companions, that, form, binary, star, systems, the, science, of, stellar, spectroscopy, was, pioneered, by, joseph, von, fraunhofer, and, angelo, secchi, by, comparing, the, spectra, of, stars, such, as, sirius, to, the, sun, they, found, differences, in, the, strength, and, number, of, their, absorption, lines, the, dark, lines, in, stellar, spectra, caused, by, the, atmosphere, s, absorption, of, specific, frequencies, in, 1865, secchi, began, classifying, stars, into, spectral, types, the, modern, version, of, the, stellar, classification, scheme, was, developed, by, annie, j, cannon, during, the, early, 1900s, the, first, direct, measurement, of, the, distance, to, a, star, 61, cygni, at, 11, 4, light, years, was, made, in, 1838, by, friedrich, bessel, using, the, parallax, technique, parallax, measurements, demonstrated, the, vast, separation, of, the, stars, in, the, heavens, observation, of, double, stars, gained, increasing, importance, during, the, 19th, century, in, 1834, friedrich, bessel, observed, changes, in, the, proper, motion, of, the, star, sirius, and, inferred, a, hidden, companion, edward, pickering, discovered, the, first, spectroscopic, binary, in, 1899, when, he, observed, the, periodic, splitting, of, the, spectral, lines, of, the, star, mizar, in, a, 104, day, period, detailed, observations, of, many, binary, star, systems, were, collected, by, astronomers, such, as, friedrich, georg, wilhelm, von, struve, and, s, w, burnham, allowing, the, masses, of, stars, to, be, determined, from, computation, of, orbital, elements, the, first, solution, to, the, problem, of, deriving, an, orbit, of, binary, stars, from, telescope, observations, was, made, by, felix, savary, in, 1827, the, twentieth, century, saw, increasingly, rapid, advances, in, the, scientific, study, of, stars, the, photograph, became, a, valuable, astronomical, tool, karl, schwarzschild, discovered, that, the, color, of, a, star, and, hence, its, temperature, could, be, determined, by, comparing, the, visual, magnitude, against, the, photographic, magnitude, the, development, of, the, photoelectric, photometer, allowed, precise, measurements, of, magnitude, at, multiple, wavelength, intervals, in, 1921, albert, a, michelson, made, the, first, measurements, of, a, stellar, diameter, using, an, interferometer, on, the, hooker, telescope, at, mount, wilson, observatory, important, theoretical, work, on, the, physical, structure, of, stars, occurred, during, the, first, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, in, 1913, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, was, developed, propelling, the, astrophysical, study, of, stars, successful, models, were, developed, to, explain, the, interiors, of, stars, and, stellar, evolution, cecilia, payne, gaposchkin, first, proposed, that, stars, were, made, primarily, of, hydrogen, and, helium, in, her, 1925, phd, thesis, the, spectra, of, stars, were, further, understood, through, advances, in, quantum, physics, this, allowed, the, chemical, composition, of, the, stellar, atmosphere, to, be, determined, with, the, exception, of, rare, events, such, as, supernovae, and, supernova, impostors, individual, stars, have, primarily, been, observed, in, the, local, group, and, especially, in, the, visible, part, of, the, milky, way, as, demonstrated, by, the, detailed, star, catalogues, available, for, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, its, satellites, individual, stars, such, as, cepheid, variables, have, been, observed, in, the, m87, and, m100, galaxies, of, the, virgo, cluster, as, well, as, luminous, stars, in, some, other, relatively, nearby, galaxies, with, the, aid, of, gravitational, lensing, a, single, star, named, icarus, has, been, observed, at, 9, billion, light, years, away, the, concept, of, a, constellation, was, known, to, exist, during, the, babylonian, period, ancient, sky, watchers, imagined, that, prominent, arrangements, of, stars, formed, patterns, and, they, associated, these, with, particular, aspects, of, nature, or, their, myths, twelve, of, these, formations, lay, along, the, band, of, the, ecliptic, and, these, became, the, basis, of, astrology, many, of, the, more, prominent, individual, stars, were, given, names, particularly, with, arabic, or, latin, designations, as, well, as, certain, constellations, and, the, sun, itself, individual, stars, have, their, own, myths, to, the, ancient, greeks, some, stars, known, as, planets, greek, plan, t, s, meaning, wanderer, represented, various, important, deities, from, which, the, names, of, the, planets, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, were, taken, uranus, and, neptune, were, greek, and, roman, gods, but, neither, planet, was, known, in, antiquity, because, of, their, low, brightness, their, names, were, assigned, by, later, astronomers, circa, 1600, the, names, of, the, constellations, were, used, to, name, the, stars, in, the, corresponding, regions, of, the, sky, the, german, astronomer, johann, bayer, created, a, series, of, star, maps, and, applied, greek, letters, as, designations, to, the, stars, in, each, constellation, later, a, numbering, system, based, on, the, star, s, right, ascension, was, invented, and, added, to, john, flamsteed, s, star, catalogue, in, his, book, historia, coelestis, britannica, the, 1712, edition, whereby, this, numbering, system, came, to, be, called, flamsteed, designation, or, flamsteed, numbering, the, internationally, recognized, authority, for, naming, celestial, bodies, is, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, the, international, astronomical, union, maintains, the, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, which, catalogs, and, standardizes, proper, names, for, stars, a, number, of, private, companies, sell, names, of, stars, which, are, not, recognized, by, the, iau, professional, astronomers, or, the, amateur, astronomy, community, the, british, library, calls, this, an, unregulated, commercial, enterprise, and, the, new, york, city, department, of, consumer, and, worker, protection, issued, a, violation, against, one, such, star, naming, company, for, engaging, in, a, deceptive, trade, practice, although, stellar, parameters, can, be, expressed, in, si, units, or, gaussian, units, it, is, often, most, convenient, to, express, mass, luminosity, and, radii, in, solar, units, based, on, the, characteristics, of, the, sun, in, 2015, the, iau, defined, a, set, of, nominal, solar, values, defined, as, si, constants, without, uncertainties, which, can, be, used, for, quoting, stellar, parameters, the, solar, mass, m, was, not, explicitly, defined, by, the, iau, due, to, the, large, relative, uncertainty, 10, 4, of, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, g, since, the, product, of, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, and, solar, mass, together, g, m, has, been, determined, to, much, greater, precision, the, iau, defined, the, nominal, solar, mass, parameter, to, be, the, nominal, solar, mass, parameter, can, be, combined, with, the, most, recent, 2014, codata, estimate, of, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, g, to, derive, the, solar, mass, to, be, approximately, 1, 9885, 10, 30, kg, although, the, exact, values, for, the, luminosity, radius, mass, parameter, and, mass, may, vary, slightly, in, the, future, due, to, observational, uncertainties, the, 2015, iau, nominal, constants, will, remain, the, same, si, values, as, they, remain, useful, measures, for, quoting, stellar, parameters, large, lengths, such, as, the, radius, of, a, giant, star, or, the, semi, major, axis, of, a, binary, star, system, are, often, expressed, in, terms, of, the, astronomical, unit, approximately, equal, to, the, mean, distance, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, 150, million, km, or, approximately, 93, million, miles, in, 2012, the, iau, defined, the, astronomical, constant, to, be, an, exact, length, in, meters, 149, 597, 870, 700, m, stars, condense, from, regions, of, space, of, higher, matter, density, yet, those, regions, are, less, dense, than, within, a, vacuum, chamber, these, regions, known, as, molecular, clouds, consist, mostly, of, hydrogen, with, about, 23, to, 28, percent, helium, and, a, few, percent, heavier, elements, one, example, of, such, a, star, forming, region, is, the, orion, nebula, most, stars, form, in, groups, of, dozens, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, stars, massive, stars, in, these, groups, may, powerfully, illuminate, those, clouds, ionizing, the, hydrogen, and, creating, h, ii, regions, such, feedback, effects, from, star, formation, may, ultimately, disrupt, the, cloud, and, prevent, further, star, formation, all, stars, spend, the, majority, of, their, existence, as, main, sequence, stars, fueled, primarily, by, the, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, within, their, cores, however, stars, of, different, masses, have, markedly, different, properties, at, various, stages, of, their, development, the, ultimate, fate, of, more, massive, stars, differs, from, that, of, less, massive, stars, as, do, their, luminosities, and, the, impact, they, have, on, their, environment, accordingly, astronomers, often, group, stars, by, their, mass, the, formation, of, a, star, begins, with, gravitational, instability, within, a, molecular, cloud, caused, by, regions, of, higher, density, often, triggered, by, compression, of, clouds, by, radiation, from, massive, stars, expanding, bubbles, in, the, interstellar, medium, the, collision, of, different, molecular, clouds, or, the, collision, of, galaxies, as, in, a, starburst, galaxy, when, a, region, reaches, a, sufficient, density, of, matter, to, satisfy, the, criteria, for, jeans, instability, it, begins, to, collapse, under, its, own, gravitational, force, as, the, cloud, collapses, individual, conglomerations, of, dense, dust, and, gas, form, bok, globules, as, a, globule, collapses, and, the, density, increases, the, gravitational, energy, converts, into, heat, and, the, temperature, rises, when, the, protostellar, cloud, has, approximately, reached, the, stable, condition, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, a, protostar, forms, at, the, core, these, pre, main, sequence, stars, are, often, surrounded, by, a, protoplanetary, disk, and, powered, mainly, by, the, conversion, of, gravitational, energy, the, period, of, gravitational, contraction, lasts, about, 10, million, years, for, a, star, like, the, sun, up, to, 100, million, years, for, a, red, dwarf, early, stars, of, less, than, 2, m, are, called, t, tauri, stars, while, those, with, greater, mass, are, herbig, ae, be, stars, these, newly, formed, stars, emit, jets, of, gas, along, their, axis, of, rotation, which, may, reduce, the, angular, momentum, of, the, collapsing, star, and, result, in, small, patches, of, nebulosity, known, as, herbig, haro, objects, these, jets, in, combination, with, radiation, from, nearby, massive, stars, may, help, to, drive, away, the, surrounding, cloud, from, which, the, star, was, formed, early, in, their, development, t, tauri, stars, follow, the, hayashi, track, they, contract, and, decrease, in, luminosity, while, remaining, at, roughly, the, same, temperature, less, massive, t, tauri, stars, follow, this, track, to, the, main, sequence, while, more, massive, stars, turn, onto, the, henyey, track, most, stars, are, observed, to, be, members, of, binary, star, systems, and, the, properties, of, those, binaries, are, the, result, of, the, conditions, in, which, they, formed, a, gas, cloud, must, lose, its, angular, momentum, in, order, to, collapse, and, form, a, star, the, fragmentation, of, the, cloud, into, multiple, stars, distributes, some, of, that, angular, momentum, the, primordial, binaries, transfer, some, angular, momentum, by, gravitational, interactions, during, close, encounters, with, other, stars, in, young, stellar, clusters, these, interactions, tend, to, split, apart, more, widely, separated, soft, binaries, while, causing, hard, binaries, to, become, more, tightly, bound, this, produces, the, separation, of, binaries, into, their, two, observed, populations, distributions, stars, spend, about, 90, of, their, lifetimes, fusing, hydrogen, into, helium, in, high, temperature, and, pressure, reactions, in, their, cores, such, stars, are, said, to, be, on, the, main, sequence, and, are, called, dwarf, stars, starting, at, zero, age, main, sequence, the, proportion, of, helium, in, a, star, s, core, will, steadily, increase, the, rate, of, nuclear, fusion, at, the, core, will, slowly, increase, as, will, the, star, s, temperature, and, luminosity, the, sun, for, example, is, estimated, to, have, increased, in, luminosity, by, about, 40, since, it, reached, the, main, sequence, 4, 6, billion, 4, 6, 10, 9, years, ago, every, star, generates, a, stellar, wind, of, particles, that, causes, a, continual, outflow, of, gas, into, space, for, most, stars, the, mass, lost, is, negligible, the, sun, loses, 10, 14, m, every, year, or, about, 0, 01, of, its, total, mass, over, its, entire, lifespan, however, very, massive, stars, can, lose, 10, 7, to, 10, 5, m, each, year, significantly, affecting, their, evolution, stars, that, begin, with, more, than, 50, m, can, lose, over, half, their, total, mass, while, on, the, main, sequence, the, time, a, star, spends, on, the, main, sequence, depends, primarily, on, the, amount, of, fuel, it, has, and, the, rate, at, which, it, fuses, it, the, sun, is, expected, to, live, 10, billion, 10, 10, years, massive, stars, consume, their, fuel, very, rapidly, and, are, short, lived, low, mass, stars, consume, their, fuel, very, slowly, stars, less, massive, than, 0, 25, m, called, red, dwarfs, are, able, to, fuse, nearly, all, of, their, mass, while, stars, of, about, 1, m, can, only, fuse, about, 10, of, their, mass, the, combination, of, their, slow, fuel, consumption, and, relatively, large, usable, fuel, supply, allows, low, mass, stars, to, last, about, one, trillion, 10, 10, 12, years, the, most, extreme, of, 0, 08, m, will, last, for, about, 12, trillion, years, red, dwarfs, become, hotter, and, more, luminous, as, they, accumulate, helium, when, they, eventually, run, out, of, hydrogen, they, contract, into, a, white, dwarf, and, decline, in, temperature, since, the, lifespan, of, such, stars, is, greater, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, 13, 8, billion, years, no, stars, under, about, 0, 85, m, are, expected, to, have, moved, off, the, main, sequence, besides, mass, the, elements, heavier, than, helium, can, play, a, significant, role, in, the, evolution, of, stars, astronomers, label, all, elements, heavier, than, helium, metals, and, call, the, chemical, concentration, of, these, elements, in, a, star, its, metallicity, a, star, s, metallicity, can, influence, the, time, the, star, takes, to, burn, its, fuel, and, controls, the, formation, of, its, magnetic, fields, which, affects, the, strength, of, its, stellar, wind, older, population, ii, stars, have, substantially, less, metallicity, than, the, younger, population, i, stars, due, to, the, composition, of, the, molecular, clouds, from, which, they, formed, over, time, such, clouds, become, increasingly, enriched, in, heavier, elements, as, older, stars, die, and, shed, portions, of, their, atmospheres, as, stars, of, at, least, 0, 4, m, exhaust, the, supply, of, hydrogen, at, their, core, they, start, to, fuse, hydrogen, in, a, shell, surrounding, the, helium, core, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, expand, and, cool, greatly, as, they, transition, into, a, red, giant, in, some, cases, they, will, fuse, heavier, elements, at, the, core, or, in, shells, around, the, core, as, the, stars, expand, they, throw, part, of, their, mass, enriched, with, those, heavier, elements, into, the, interstellar, environment, to, be, recycled, later, as, new, stars, in, about, 5, billion, years, when, the, sun, enters, the, helium, burning, phase, it, will, expand, to, a, maximum, radius, of, roughly, 1, astronomical, unit, 150, million, kilometres, 250, times, its, present, size, and, lose, 30, of, its, current, mass, as, the, hydrogen, burning, shell, produces, more, helium, the, core, increases, in, mass, and, temperature, in, a, red, giant, of, up, to, 2, 25, m, the, mass, of, the, helium, core, becomes, degenerate, prior, to, helium, fusion, finally, when, the, temperature, increases, sufficiently, core, helium, fusion, begins, explosively, in, what, is, called, a, helium, flash, and, the, star, rapidly, shrinks, in, radius, increases, its, surface, temperature, and, moves, to, the, horizontal, branch, of, the, hr, diagram, for, more, massive, stars, helium, core, fusion, starts, before, the, core, becomes, degenerate, and, the, star, spends, some, time, in, the, red, clump, slowly, burning, helium, before, the, outer, convective, envelope, collapses, and, the, star, then, moves, to, the, horizontal, branch, after, a, star, has, fused, the, helium, of, its, core, it, begins, fusing, helium, along, a, shell, surrounding, the, hot, carbon, core, the, star, then, follows, an, evolutionary, path, called, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, agb, that, parallels, the, other, described, red, giant, phase, but, with, a, higher, luminosity, the, more, massive, agb, stars, may, undergo, a, brief, period, of, carbon, fusion, before, the, core, becomes, degenerate, during, the, agb, phase, stars, undergo, thermal, pulses, due, to, instabilities, in, the, core, of, the, star, in, these, thermal, pulses, the, luminosity, of, the, star, varies, and, matter, is, ejected, from, the, star, s, atmosphere, ultimately, forming, a, planetary, nebula, as, much, as, 50, to, 70, of, a, star, s, mass, can, be, ejected, in, this, mass, loss, process, because, energy, transport, in, an, agb, star, is, primarily, by, convection, this, ejected, material, is, enriched, with, the, fusion, products, dredged, up, from, the, core, therefore, the, planetary, nebula, is, enriched, with, elements, like, carbon, and, oxygen, ultimately, the, planetary, nebula, disperses, enriching, the, general, interstellar, medium, therefore, future, generations, of, stars, are, made, of, the, star, stuff, from, past, stars, during, their, helium, burning, phase, a, star, of, more, than, 9, solar, masses, expands, to, form, first, a, blue, supergiant, and, then, a, red, supergiant, particularly, massive, stars, exceeding, 40, solar, masses, like, alnilam, the, central, blue, supergiant, of, orion, s, belt, do, not, become, red, supergiants, due, to, high, mass, loss, these, may, instead, evolve, to, a, wolf, rayet, star, characterised, by, spectra, dominated, by, emission, lines, of, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, which, have, reached, the, surface, due, to, strong, convection, and, intense, mass, loss, or, from, stripping, of, the, outer, layers, when, helium, is, exhausted, at, the, core, of, a, massive, star, the, core, contracts, and, the, temperature, and, pressure, rises, enough, to, fuse, carbon, see, carbon, burning, process, this, process, continues, with, the, successive, stages, being, fueled, by, neon, see, neon, burning, process, oxygen, see, oxygen, burning, process, and, silicon, see, silicon, burning, process, near, the, end, of, the, star, s, life, fusion, continues, along, a, series, of, onion, layer, shells, within, a, massive, star, each, shell, fuses, a, different, element, with, the, outermost, shell, fusing, hydrogen, the, next, shell, fusing, helium, and, so, forth, the, final, stage, occurs, when, a, massive, star, begins, producing, iron, since, iron, nuclei, are, more, tightly, bound, than, any, heavier, nuclei, any, fusion, beyond, iron, does, not, produce, a, net, release, of, energy, some, massive, stars, particularly, luminous, blue, variables, are, very, unstable, to, the, extent, that, they, violently, shed, their, mass, into, space, in, events, supernova, impostors, becoming, significantly, brighter, in, the, process, eta, carinae, is, known, for, having, underwent, a, supernova, impostor, event, the, great, eruption, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, star, s, core, shrinks, the, intensity, of, radiation, from, that, surface, increases, creating, such, radiation, pressure, on, the, outer, shell, of, gas, that, it, will, push, those, layers, away, forming, a, planetary, nebula, if, what, remains, after, the, outer, atmosphere, has, been, shed, is, less, than, roughly, 1, 4, m, it, shrinks, to, a, relatively, tiny, object, about, the, size, of, earth, known, as, a, white, dwarf, white, dwarfs, lack, the, mass, for, further, gravitational, compression, to, take, place, the, electron, degenerate, matter, inside, a, white, dwarf, is, no, longer, a, plasma, eventually, white, dwarfs, fade, into, black, dwarfs, over, a, very, long, period, of, time, in, massive, stars, fusion, continues, until, the, iron, core, has, grown, so, large, more, than, 1, 4, m, that, it, can, no, longer, support, its, own, mass, this, core, will, suddenly, collapse, as, its, electrons, are, driven, into, its, protons, forming, neutrons, neutrinos, and, gamma, rays, in, a, burst, of, electron, capture, and, inverse, beta, decay, the, shockwave, formed, by, this, sudden, collapse, causes, the, rest, of, the, star, to, explode, in, a, supernova, supernovae, become, so, bright, that, they, may, briefly, outshine, the, star, s, entire, home, galaxy, when, they, occur, within, the, milky, way, supernovae, have, historically, been, observed, by, naked, eye, observers, as, new, stars, where, none, seemingly, existed, before, a, supernova, explosion, blows, away, the, star, s, outer, layers, leaving, a, remnant, such, as, the, crab, nebula, the, core, is, compressed, into, a, neutron, star, which, sometimes, manifests, itself, as, a, pulsar, or, x, ray, burster, in, the, case, of, the, largest, stars, the, remnant, is, a, black, hole, greater, than, 4, m, in, a, neutron, star, the, matter, is, in, a, state, known, as, neutron, degenerate, matter, with, a, more, exotic, form, of, degenerate, matter, qcd, matter, possibly, present, in, the, core, the, blown, off, outer, layers, of, dying, stars, include, heavy, elements, which, may, be, recycled, during, the, formation, of, new, stars, these, heavy, elements, allow, the, formation, of, rocky, planets, the, outflow, from, supernovae, and, the, stellar, wind, of, large, stars, play, an, important, part, in, shaping, the, interstellar, medium, binary, stars, evolution, may, significantly, differ, from, that, of, single, stars, of, the, same, mass, for, example, when, any, star, expands, to, become, a, red, giant, it, may, overflow, its, roche, lobe, the, surrounding, region, where, material, is, gravitationally, bound, to, it, if, stars, in, a, binary, system, are, close, enough, some, of, that, material, may, overflow, to, the, other, star, yielding, phenomena, including, contact, binaries, common, envelope, binaries, cataclysmic, variables, blue, stragglers, and, type, ia, supernovae, mass, transfer, leads, to, cases, such, as, the, algol, paradox, where, the, most, evolved, star, in, a, system, is, the, least, massive, the, evolution, of, binary, star, and, higher, order, star, systems, is, intensely, researched, since, so, many, stars, have, been, found, to, be, members, of, binary, systems, around, half, of, sun, like, stars, and, an, even, higher, proportion, of, more, massive, stars, form, in, multiple, systems, and, this, may, greatly, influence, such, phenomena, as, novae, and, supernovae, the, formation, of, certain, types, of, star, and, the, enrichment, of, space, with, nucleosynthesis, products, the, influence, of, binary, star, evolution, on, the, formation, of, evolved, massive, stars, such, as, luminous, blue, variables, wolf, rayet, stars, and, the, progenitors, of, certain, classes, of, core, collapse, supernova, is, still, disputed, single, massive, stars, may, be, unable, to, expel, their, outer, layers, fast, enough, to, form, the, types, and, numbers, of, evolved, stars, that, are, observed, or, to, produce, progenitors, that, would, explode, as, the, supernovae, that, are, observed, mass, transfer, through, gravitational, stripping, in, binary, systems, is, seen, by, some, astronomers, as, the, solution, to, that, problem, stars, are, not, spread, uniformly, across, the, universe, but, are, normally, grouped, into, galaxies, along, with, interstellar, gas, and, dust, a, typical, large, galaxy, like, the, milky, way, contains, hundreds, of, billions, of, stars, there, are, more, than, 2, trillion, 10, 12, galaxies, though, most, are, less, than, 10, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, overall, there, are, likely, to, be, between, 10, 22, and, 10, 24, stars, more, stars, than, all, the, grains, of, sand, on, planet, earth, most, stars, are, within, galaxies, but, between, 10, and, 50, of, the, starlight, in, large, galaxy, clusters, may, come, from, stars, outside, of, any, galaxy, a, multi, star, system, consists, of, two, or, more, gravitationally, bound, stars, that, orbit, each, other, the, simplest, and, most, common, multi, star, system, is, a, binary, star, but, systems, of, three, or, more, stars, exist, for, reasons, of, orbital, stability, such, multi, star, systems, are, often, organized, into, hierarchical, sets, of, binary, stars, larger, groups, are, called, star, clusters, these, range, from, loose, stellar, associations, with, only, a, few, stars, to, open, clusters, with, dozens, to, thousands, of, stars, up, to, enormous, globular, clusters, with, hundreds, of, thousands, of, stars, such, systems, orbit, their, host, galaxy, the, stars, in, an, open, or, globular, cluster, all, formed, from, the, same, giant, molecular, cloud, so, all, members, normally, have, similar, ages, and, compositions, many, stars, are, observed, and, most, or, all, may, have, originally, formed, in, gravitationally, bound, multiple, star, systems, this, is, particularly, true, for, very, massive, o, and, b, class, stars, 80, of, which, are, believed, to, be, part, of, multiple, star, systems, the, proportion, of, single, star, systems, increases, with, decreasing, star, mass, so, that, only, 25, of, red, dwarfs, are, known, to, have, stellar, companions, as, 85, of, all, stars, are, red, dwarfs, more, than, two, thirds, of, stars, in, the, milky, way, are, likely, single, red, dwarfs, in, a, 2017, study, of, the, perseus, molecular, cloud, astronomers, found, that, most, of, the, newly, formed, stars, are, in, binary, systems, in, the, model, that, best, explained, the, data, all, stars, initially, formed, as, binaries, though, some, binaries, later, split, up, and, leave, single, stars, behind, the, nearest, star, to, the, earth, apart, from, the, sun, is, proxima, centauri, 4, 2465, light, years, 40, 175, trillion, kilometres, away, travelling, at, the, orbital, speed, of, the, space, shuttle, 8, kilometres, per, second, 29, 000, kilometres, per, hour, it, would, take, about, 150, 000, years, to, arrive, this, is, typical, of, stellar, separations, in, galactic, discs, stars, can, be, much, closer, to, each, other, in, the, centres, of, galaxies, and, in, globular, clusters, or, much, farther, apart, in, galactic, halos, due, to, the, relatively, vast, distances, between, stars, outside, the, galactic, nucleus, collisions, between, stars, are, thought, to, be, rare, in, denser, regions, such, as, the, core, of, globular, clusters, or, the, galactic, center, collisions, can, be, more, common, such, collisions, can, produce, what, are, known, as, blue, stragglers, these, abnormal, stars, have, a, higher, surface, temperature, and, thus, are, bluer, than, stars, at, the, main, sequence, turnoff, in, the, cluster, to, which, they, belong, in, standard, stellar, evolution, blue, stragglers, would, already, have, evolved, off, the, main, sequence, and, thus, would, not, be, seen, in, the, cluster, almost, everything, about, a, star, is, determined, by, its, initial, mass, including, such, characteristics, as, luminosity, size, evolution, lifespan, and, its, eventual, fate, most, stars, are, between, 1, billion, and, 10, billion, years, old, some, stars, may, even, be, close, to, 13, 8, billion, years, old, the, observed, age, of, the, universe, the, oldest, star, yet, discovered, hd, 140283, nicknamed, methuselah, star, is, an, estimated, 14, 46, 0, 8, billion, years, old, due, to, the, uncertainty, in, the, value, this, age, for, the, star, does, not, conflict, with, the, age, of, the, universe, determined, by, the, planck, satellite, as, 13, 799, 0, 021, the, more, massive, the, star, the, shorter, its, lifespan, primarily, because, massive, stars, have, greater, pressure, on, their, cores, causing, them, to, burn, hydrogen, more, rapidly, the, most, massive, stars, last, an, average, of, a, few, million, years, while, stars, of, minimum, mass, red, dwarfs, burn, their, fuel, very, slowly, and, can, last, tens, to, hundreds, of, billions, of, years, when, stars, form, in, the, present, milky, way, galaxy, they, are, composed, of, about, 71, hydrogen, and, 27, helium, as, measured, by, mass, with, a, small, fraction, of, heavier, elements, typically, the, portion, of, heavy, elements, is, measured, in, terms, of, the, iron, content, of, the, stellar, atmosphere, as, iron, is, a, common, element, and, its, absorption, lines, are, relatively, easy, to, measure, the, portion, of, heavier, elements, may, be, an, indicator, of, the, likelihood, that, the, star, has, a, planetary, system, as, of, 2005, the, star, with, the, lowest, iron, content, ever, measured, is, the, dwarf, he1327, 2326, with, only, 1, 200, 000th, the, iron, content, of, the, sun, by, contrast, the, super, metal, rich, star, leonis, has, nearly, double, the, abundance, of, iron, as, the, sun, while, the, planet, bearing, star, 14, herculis, has, nearly, triple, the, iron, chemically, peculiar, stars, show, unusual, abundances, of, certain, elements, in, their, spectrum, especially, chromium, and, rare, earth, elements, stars, with, cooler, outer, atmospheres, including, the, sun, can, form, various, diatomic, and, polyatomic, molecules, due, to, their, great, distance, from, the, earth, all, stars, except, the, sun, appear, to, the, unaided, eye, as, shining, points, in, the, night, sky, that, twinkle, because, of, the, effect, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, sun, is, close, enough, to, the, earth, to, appear, as, a, disk, instead, and, to, provide, daylight, other, than, the, sun, the, star, with, the, largest, apparent, size, is, r, doradus, with, an, angular, diameter, of, only, 0, 057, arcseconds, the, disks, of, most, stars, are, much, too, small, in, angular, size, to, be, observed, with, current, ground, based, optical, telescopes, and, so, interferometer, telescopes, are, required, to, produce, images, of, these, objects, another, technique, for, measuring, the, angular, size, of, stars, is, through, occultation, by, precisely, measuring, the, drop, in, brightness, of, a, star, as, it, is, occulted, by, the, moon, or, the, rise, in, brightness, when, it, reappears, the, star, s, angular, diameter, can, be, computed, stars, range, in, size, from, neutron, stars, which, vary, anywhere, from, 20, to, 40, km, 25, mi, in, diameter, to, supergiants, like, betelgeuse, in, the, orion, constellation, which, has, a, diameter, about, 640, times, that, of, the, sun, with, a, much, lower, density, the, motion, of, a, star, relative, to, the, sun, can, provide, useful, information, about, the, origin, and, age, of, a, star, as, well, as, the, structure, and, evolution, of, the, surrounding, galaxy, the, components, of, motion, of, a, star, consist, of, the, radial, velocity, toward, or, away, from, the, sun, and, the, traverse, angular, movement, which, is, called, its, proper, motion, radial, velocity, is, measured, by, the, doppler, shift, of, the, star, s, spectral, lines, and, is, given, in, units, of, km, s, the, proper, motion, of, a, star, its, parallax, is, determined, by, precise, astrometric, measurements, in, units, of, milli, arc, seconds, mas, per, year, with, knowledge, of, the, star, s, parallax, and, its, distance, the, proper, motion, velocity, can, be, calculated, together, with, the, radial, velocity, the, total, velocity, can, be, calculated, stars, with, high, rates, of, proper, motion, are, likely, to, be, relatively, close, to, the, sun, making, them, good, candidates, for, parallax, measurements, when, both, rates, of, movement, are, known, the, space, velocity, of, the, star, relative, to, the, sun, or, the, galaxy, can, be, computed, among, nearby, stars, it, has, been, found, that, younger, population, i, stars, have, generally, lower, velocities, than, older, population, ii, stars, the, latter, have, elliptical, orbits, that, are, inclined, to, the, plane, of, the, galaxy, a, comparison, of, the, kinematics, of, nearby, stars, has, allowed, astronomers, to, trace, their, origin, to, common, points, in, giant, molecular, clouds, and, are, referred, to, as, stellar, associations, the, magnetic, field, of, a, star, is, generated, within, regions, of, the, interior, where, convective, circulation, occurs, this, movement, of, conductive, plasma, functions, like, a, dynamo, wherein, the, movement, of, electrical, charges, induce, magnetic, fields, as, does, a, mechanical, dynamo, those, magnetic, fields, have, a, great, range, that, extend, throughout, and, beyond, the, star, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, varies, with, the, mass, and, composition, of, the, star, and, the, amount, of, magnetic, surface, activity, depends, upon, the, star, s, rate, of, rotation, this, surface, activity, produces, starspots, which, are, regions, of, strong, magnetic, fields, and, lower, than, normal, surface, temperatures, coronal, loops, are, arching, magnetic, field, flux, lines, that, rise, from, a, star, s, surface, into, the, star, s, outer, atmosphere, its, corona, the, coronal, loops, can, be, seen, due, to, the, plasma, they, conduct, along, their, length, stellar, flares, are, bursts, of, high, energy, particles, that, are, emitted, due, to, the, same, magnetic, activity, young, rapidly, rotating, stars, tend, to, have, high, levels, of, surface, activity, because, of, their, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, field, can, act, upon, a, star, s, stellar, wind, functioning, as, a, brake, to, gradually, slow, the, rate, of, rotation, with, time, thus, older, stars, such, as, the, sun, have, a, much, slower, rate, of, rotation, and, a, lower, level, of, surface, activity, the, activity, levels, of, slowly, rotating, stars, tend, to, vary, in, a, cyclical, manner, and, can, shut, down, altogether, for, periods, of, time, during, the, maunder, minimum, for, example, the, sun, underwent, a, 70, year, period, with, almost, no, sunspot, activity, stars, have, masses, ranging, from, less, than, half, the, solar, mass, to, over, 200, solar, masses, see, list, of, most, massive, stars, one, of, the, most, massive, stars, known, is, eta, carinae, which, with, 100, 150, times, as, much, mass, as, the, sun, will, have, a, lifespan, of, only, several, million, years, studies, of, the, most, massive, open, clusters, suggests, 150, m, as, a, rough, upper, limit, for, stars, in, the, current, era, of, the, universe, this, represents, an, empirical, value, for, the, theoretical, limit, on, the, mass, of, forming, stars, due, to, increasing, radiation, pressure, on, the, accreting, gas, cloud, several, stars, in, the, r136, cluster, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, have, been, measured, with, larger, masses, but, it, has, been, determined, that, they, could, have, been, created, through, the, collision, and, merger, of, massive, stars, in, close, binary, systems, sidestepping, the, 150, m, limit, on, massive, star, formation, the, first, stars, to, form, after, the, big, bang, may, have, been, larger, up, to, 300, m, due, to, the, complete, absence, of, elements, heavier, than, lithium, in, their, composition, this, generation, of, supermassive, population, iii, stars, is, likely, to, have, existed, in, the, very, early, universe, i, e, they, are, observed, to, have, a, high, redshift, and, may, have, started, the, production, of, chemical, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, that, are, needed, for, the, later, formation, of, planets, and, life, in, june, 2015, astronomers, reported, evidence, for, population, iii, stars, in, the, cosmos, redshift, 7, galaxy, at, z, 6, 60, with, a, mass, only, 80, times, that, of, jupiter, m, j, 2mass, j0523, 1403, is, the, smallest, known, star, undergoing, nuclear, fusion, in, its, core, for, stars, with, metallicity, similar, to, the, sun, the, theoretical, minimum, mass, the, star, can, have, and, still, undergo, fusion, at, the, core, is, estimated, to, be, about, 75, m, j, when, the, metallicity, is, very, low, the, minimum, star, size, seems, to, be, about, 8, 3, of, the, solar, mass, or, about, 87, m, j, smaller, bodies, called, brown, dwarfs, occupy, a, poorly, defined, grey, area, between, stars, and, gas, giants, the, combination, of, the, radius, and, the, mass, of, a, star, determines, its, surface, gravity, giant, stars, have, a, much, lower, surface, gravity, than, do, main, sequence, stars, while, the, opposite, is, the, case, for, degenerate, compact, stars, such, as, white, dwarfs, the, surface, gravity, can, influence, the, appearance, of, a, star, s, spectrum, with, higher, gravity, causing, a, broadening, of, the, absorption, lines, the, rotation, rate, of, stars, can, be, determined, through, spectroscopic, measurement, or, more, exactly, determined, by, tracking, their, starspots, young, stars, can, have, a, rotation, greater, than, 100, km, s, at, the, equator, the, b, class, star, achernar, for, example, has, an, equatorial, velocity, of, about, 225, km, s, or, greater, causing, its, equator, to, bulge, outward, and, giving, it, an, equatorial, diameter, that, is, more, than, 50, greater, than, between, the, poles, this, rate, of, rotation, is, just, below, the, critical, velocity, of, 300, km, s, at, which, speed, the, star, would, break, apart, by, contrast, the, sun, rotates, once, every, 25, 35, days, depending, on, latitude, with, an, equatorial, velocity, of, 1, 93, km, s, a, main, sequence, star, s, magnetic, field, and, the, stellar, wind, serve, to, slow, its, rotation, by, a, significant, amount, as, it, evolves, on, the, main, sequence, degenerate, stars, have, contracted, into, a, compact, mass, resulting, in, a, rapid, rate, of, rotation, however, they, have, relatively, low, rates, of, rotation, compared, to, what, would, be, expected, by, conservation, of, angular, momentum, the, tendency, of, a, rotating, body, to, compensate, for, a, contraction, in, size, by, increasing, its, rate, of, spin, a, large, portion, of, the, star, s, angular, momentum, is, dissipated, as, a, result, of, mass, loss, through, the, stellar, wind, in, spite, of, this, the, rate, of, rotation, for, a, pulsar, can, be, very, rapid, the, pulsar, at, the, heart, of, the, crab, nebula, for, example, rotates, 30, times, per, second, the, rotation, rate, of, the, pulsar, will, gradually, slow, due, to, the, emission, of, radiation, the, surface, temperature, of, a, main, sequence, star, is, determined, by, the, rate, of, energy, production, of, its, core, and, by, its, radius, and, is, often, estimated, from, the, star, s, color, index, the, temperature, is, normally, given, in, terms, of, an, effective, temperature, which, is, the, temperature, of, an, idealized, black, body, that, radiates, its, energy, at, the, same, luminosity, per, surface, area, as, the, star, the, effective, temperature, is, only, representative, of, the, surface, as, the, temperature, increases, toward, the, core, the, temperature, in, the, core, region, of, a, star, is, several, million, kelvins, the, stellar, temperature, will, determine, the, rate, of, ionization, of, various, elements, resulting, in, characteristic, absorption, lines, in, the, spectrum, the, surface, temperature, of, a, star, along, with, its, visual, absolute, magnitude, and, absorption, features, is, used, to, classify, a, star, see, classification, below, massive, main, sequence, stars, can, have, surface, temperatures, of, 50, 000, k, smaller, stars, such, as, the, sun, have, surface, temperatures, of, a, few, thousand, k, red, giants, have, relatively, low, surface, temperatures, of, about, 3, 600, k, but, they, have, a, high, luminosity, due, to, their, large, exterior, surface, area, the, energy, produced, by, stars, a, product, of, nuclear, fusion, radiates, to, space, as, both, electromagnetic, radiation, and, particle, radiation, the, particle, radiation, emitted, by, a, star, is, manifested, as, the, stellar, wind, which, streams, from, the, outer, layers, as, electrically, charged, protons, and, alpha, and, beta, particles, a, steady, stream, of, almost, massless, neutrinos, emanate, directly, from, the, star, s, core, the, production, of, energy, at, the, core, is, the, reason, stars, shine, so, brightly, every, time, two, or, more, atomic, nuclei, fuse, together, to, form, a, single, atomic, nucleus, of, a, new, heavier, element, gamma, ray, photons, are, released, from, the, nuclear, fusion, product, this, energy, is, converted, to, other, forms, of, electromagnetic, energy, of, lower, frequency, such, as, visible, light, by, the, time, it, reaches, the, star, s, outer, layers, the, color, of, a, star, as, determined, by, the, most, intense, frequency, of, the, visible, light, depends, on, the, temperature, of, the, star, s, outer, layers, including, its, photosphere, besides, visible, light, stars, emit, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, that, are, invisible, to, the, human, eye, in, fact, stellar, electromagnetic, radiation, spans, the, entire, electromagnetic, spectrum, from, the, longest, wavelengths, of, radio, waves, through, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, to, the, shortest, of, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, from, the, standpoint, of, total, energy, emitted, by, a, star, not, all, components, of, stellar, electromagnetic, radiation, are, significant, but, all, frequencies, provide, insight, into, the, star, s, physics, using, the, stellar, spectrum, astronomers, can, determine, the, surface, temperature, surface, gravity, metallicity, and, rotational, velocity, of, a, star, if, the, distance, of, the, star, is, found, such, as, by, measuring, the, parallax, then, the, luminosity, of, the, star, can, be, derived, the, mass, radius, surface, gravity, and, rotation, period, can, then, be, estimated, based, on, stellar, models, mass, can, be, calculated, for, stars, in, binary, systems, by, measuring, their, orbital, velocities, and, distances, gravitational, microlensing, has, been, used, to, measure, the, mass, of, a, single, star, with, these, parameters, astronomers, can, estimate, the, age, of, the, star, the, luminosity, of, a, star, is, the, amount, of, light, and, other, forms, of, radiant, energy, it, radiates, per, unit, of, time, it, has, units, of, power, the, luminosity, of, a, star, is, determined, by, its, radius, and, surface, temperature, many, stars, do, not, radiate, uniformly, across, their, entire, surface, the, rapidly, rotating, star, vega, for, example, has, a, higher, energy, flux, power, per, unit, area, at, its, poles, than, along, its, equator, patches, of, the, star, s, surface, with, a, lower, temperature, and, luminosity, than, average, are, known, as, starspots, small, dwarf, stars, such, as, the, sun, generally, have, essentially, featureless, disks, with, only, small, starspots, giant, stars, have, much, larger, more, obvious, starspots, and, they, exhibit, strong, stellar, limb, darkening, that, is, the, brightness, decreases, towards, the, edge, of, the, stellar, disk, red, dwarf, flare, stars, such, as, uv, ceti, may, possess, prominent, starspot, features, the, apparent, brightness, of, a, star, is, expressed, in, terms, of, its, apparent, magnitude, it, is, a, function, of, the, star, s, luminosity, its, distance, from, earth, the, extinction, effect, of, interstellar, dust, and, gas, and, the, altering, of, the, star, s, light, as, it, passes, through, earth, s, atmosphere, intrinsic, or, absolute, magnitude, is, directly, related, to, a, star, s, luminosity, and, is, the, apparent, magnitude, a, star, would, be, if, the, distance, between, the, earth, and, the, star, were, 10, parsecs, 32, 6, light, years, both, the, apparent, and, absolute, magnitude, scales, are, logarithmic, units, one, whole, number, difference, in, magnitude, is, equal, to, a, brightness, variation, of, about, 2, 5, times, the, 5th, root, of, 100, or, approximately, 2, 512, this, means, that, a, first, magnitude, star, 1, 00, is, about, 2, 5, times, brighter, than, a, second, magnitude, 2, 00, star, and, about, 100, times, brighter, than, a, sixth, magnitude, star, 6, 00, the, faintest, stars, visible, to, the, naked, eye, under, good, seeing, conditions, are, about, magnitude, 6, on, both, apparent, and, absolute, magnitude, scales, the, smaller, the, magnitude, number, the, brighter, the, star, the, larger, the, magnitude, number, the, fainter, the, star, the, brightest, stars, on, either, scale, have, negative, magnitude, numbers, the, variation, in, brightness, l, between, two, stars, is, calculated, by, subtracting, the, magnitude, number, of, the, brighter, star, m, b, from, the, magnitude, number, of, the, fainter, star, m, f, then, using, the, difference, as, an, exponent, for, the, base, number, 2, 512, that, is, to, say, relative, to, both, luminosity, and, distance, from, earth, a, star, s, absolute, magnitude, m, and, apparent, magnitude, m, are, not, equivalent, for, example, the, bright, star, sirius, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 1, 44, but, it, has, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 1, 41, the, sun, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 26, 7, but, its, absolute, magnitude, is, only, 4, 83, sirius, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, as, seen, from, earth, is, approximately, 23, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, while, canopus, the, second, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, with, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 5, 53, is, approximately, 14, 000, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, despite, canopus, being, vastly, more, luminous, than, sirius, the, latter, star, appears, the, brighter, of, the, two, this, is, because, sirius, is, merely, 8, 6, light, years, from, the, earth, while, canopus, is, much, farther, away, at, a, distance, of, 310, light, years, the, most, luminous, known, stars, have, absolute, magnitudes, of, roughly, 12, corresponding, to, 6, million, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, theoretically, the, least, luminous, stars, are, at, the, lower, limit, of, mass, at, which, stars, are, capable, of, supporting, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, in, the, core, stars, just, above, this, limit, have, been, located, in, the, ngc, 6397, cluster, the, faintest, red, dwarfs, in, the, cluster, are, absolute, magnitude, 15, while, a, 17th, absolute, magnitude, white, dwarf, has, been, discovered, the, current, stellar, classification, system, originated, in, the, early, 20th, century, when, stars, were, classified, from, a, to, q, based, on, the, strength, of, the, hydrogen, line, it, was, thought, that, the, hydrogen, line, strength, was, a, simple, linear, function, of, temperature, instead, it, was, more, complicated, it, strengthened, with, increasing, temperature, peaked, near, 9000, k, and, then, declined, at, greater, temperatures, the, classifications, were, since, reordered, by, temperature, on, which, the, modern, scheme, is, based, stars, are, given, a, single, letter, classification, according, to, their, spectra, ranging, from, type, o, which, are, very, hot, to, m, which, are, so, cool, that, molecules, may, form, in, their, atmospheres, the, main, classifications, in, order, of, decreasing, surface, temperature, are, o, b, a, f, g, k, and, m, a, variety, of, rare, spectral, types, are, given, special, classifications, the, most, common, of, these, are, types, l, and, t, which, classify, the, coldest, low, mass, stars, and, brown, dwarfs, each, letter, has, 10, sub, divisions, numbered, from, 0, to, 9, in, order, of, decreasing, temperature, however, this, system, breaks, down, at, extreme, high, temperatures, as, classes, o0, and, o1, may, not, exist, in, addition, stars, may, be, classified, by, the, luminosity, effects, found, in, their, spectral, lines, which, correspond, to, their, spatial, size, and, is, determined, by, their, surface, gravity, these, range, from, 0, hypergiants, through, iii, giants, to, v, main, sequence, dwarfs, some, authors, add, vii, white, dwarfs, main, sequence, stars, fall, along, a, narrow, diagonal, band, when, graphed, according, to, their, absolute, magnitude, and, spectral, type, the, sun, is, a, main, sequence, g2v, yellow, dwarf, of, intermediate, temperature, and, ordinary, size, there, is, additional, nomenclature, in, the, form, of, lower, case, letters, added, to, the, end, of, the, spectral, type, to, indicate, peculiar, features, of, the, spectrum, for, example, an, e, can, indicate, the, presence, of, emission, lines, m, represents, unusually, strong, levels, of, metals, and, var, can, mean, variations, in, the, spectral, type, white, dwarf, stars, have, their, own, class, that, begins, with, the, letter, d, this, is, further, sub, divided, into, the, classes, da, db, dc, do, dz, and, dq, depending, on, the, types, of, prominent, lines, found, in, the, spectrum, this, is, followed, by, a, numerical, value, that, indicates, the, temperature, variable, stars, have, periodic, or, random, changes, in, luminosity, because, of, intrinsic, or, extrinsic, properties, of, the, intrinsically, variable, stars, the, primary, types, can, be, subdivided, into, three, principal, groups, during, their, stellar, evolution, some, stars, pass, through, phases, where, they, can, become, pulsating, variables, pulsating, variable, stars, vary, in, radius, and, luminosity, over, time, expanding, and, contracting, with, periods, ranging, from, minutes, to, years, depending, on, the, size, of, the, star, this, category, includes, cepheid, and, cepheid, like, stars, and, long, period, variables, such, as, mira, eruptive, variables, are, stars, that, experience, sudden, increases, in, luminosity, because, of, flares, or, mass, ejection, events, this, group, includes, protostars, wolf, rayet, stars, and, flare, stars, as, well, as, giant, and, supergiant, stars, cataclysmic, or, explosive, variable, stars, are, those, that, undergo, a, dramatic, change, in, their, properties, this, group, includes, novae, and, supernovae, a, binary, star, system, that, includes, a, nearby, white, dwarf, can, produce, certain, types, of, these, spectacular, stellar, explosions, including, the, nova, and, a, type, 1a, supernova, the, explosion, is, created, when, the, white, dwarf, accretes, hydrogen, from, the, companion, star, building, up, mass, until, the, hydrogen, undergoes, fusion, some, novae, are, recurrent, having, periodic, outbursts, of, moderate, amplitude, stars, can, vary, in, luminosity, because, of, extrinsic, factors, such, as, eclipsing, binaries, as, well, as, rotating, stars, that, produce, extreme, starspots, a, notable, example, of, an, eclipsing, binary, is, algol, which, regularly, varies, in, magnitude, from, 2, 1, to, 3, 4, over, a, period, of, 2, 87, days, the, interior, of, a, stable, star, is, in, a, state, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, forces, on, any, small, volume, almost, exactly, counterbalance, each, other, the, balanced, forces, are, inward, gravitational, force, and, an, outward, force, due, to, the, pressure, gradient, within, the, star, the, pressure, gradient, is, established, by, the, temperature, gradient, of, the, plasma, the, outer, part, of, the, star, is, cooler, than, the, core, the, temperature, at, the, core, of, a, main, sequence, or, giant, star, is, at, least, on, the, order, of, 10, 7, k, the, resulting, temperature, and, pressure, at, the, hydrogen, burning, core, of, a, main, sequence, star, are, sufficient, for, nuclear, fusion, to, occur, and, for, sufficient, energy, to, be, produced, to, prevent, further, collapse, of, the, star, as, atomic, nuclei, are, fused, in, the, core, they, emit, energy, in, the, form, of, gamma, rays, these, photons, interact, with, the, surrounding, plasma, adding, to, the, thermal, energy, at, the, core, stars, on, the, main, sequence, convert, hydrogen, into, helium, creating, a, slowly, but, steadily, increasing, proportion, of, helium, in, the, core, eventually, the, helium, content, becomes, predominant, and, energy, production, ceases, at, the, core, instead, for, stars, of, more, than, 0, 4, m, fusion, occurs, in, a, slowly, expanding, shell, around, the, degenerate, helium, core, in, addition, to, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, interior, of, a, stable, star, will, maintain, an, energy, balance, of, thermal, equilibrium, there, is, a, radial, temperature, gradient, throughout, the, interior, that, results, in, a, flux, of, energy, flowing, toward, the, exterior, the, outgoing, flux, of, energy, leaving, any, layer, within, the, star, will, exactly, match, the, incoming, flux, from, below, the, radiation, zone, is, the, region, of, the, stellar, interior, where, the, flux, of, energy, outward, is, dependent, on, radiative, heat, transfer, since, convective, heat, transfer, is, inefficient, in, that, zone, in, this, region, the, plasma, will, not, be, perturbed, and, any, mass, motions, will, die, out, where, this, is, not, the, case, then, the, plasma, becomes, unstable, and, convection, will, occur, forming, a, convection, zone, this, can, occur, for, example, in, regions, where, very, high, energy, fluxes, occur, such, as, near, the, core, or, in, areas, with, high, opacity, making, radiatative, heat, transfer, inefficient, as, in, the, outer, envelope, the, occurrence, of, convection, in, the, outer, envelope, of, a, main, sequence, star, depends, on, the, star, s, mass, stars, with, several, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, have, a, convection, zone, deep, within, the, interior, and, a, radiative, zone, in, the, outer, layers, smaller, stars, such, as, the, sun, are, just, the, opposite, with, the, convective, zone, located, in, the, outer, layers, red, dwarf, stars, with, less, than, 0, 4, m, are, convective, throughout, which, prevents, the, accumulation, of, a, helium, core, for, most, stars, the, convective, zones, will, vary, over, time, as, the, star, ages, and, the, constitution, of, the, interior, is, modified, the, photosphere, is, that, portion, of, a, star, that, is, visible, to, an, observer, this, is, the, layer, at, which, the, plasma, of, the, star, becomes, transparent, to, photons, of, light, from, here, the, energy, generated, at, the, core, becomes, free, to, propagate, into, space, it, is, within, the, photosphere, that, sun, spots, regions, of, lower, than, average, temperature, appear, above, the, level, of, the, photosphere, is, the, stellar, atmosphere, in, a, main, sequence, star, such, as, the, sun, the, lowest, level, of, the, atmosphere, just, above, the, photosphere, is, the, thin, chromosphere, region, where, spicules, appear, and, stellar, flares, begin, above, this, is, the, transition, region, where, the, temperature, rapidly, increases, within, a, distance, of, only, 100, km, 62, mi, beyond, this, is, the, corona, a, volume, of, super, heated, plasma, that, can, extend, outward, to, several, million, kilometres, the, existence, of, a, corona, appears, to, be, dependent, on, a, convective, zone, in, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, despite, its, high, temperature, the, corona, emits, very, little, light, due, to, its, low, gas, density, the, corona, region, of, the, sun, is, normally, only, visible, during, a, solar, eclipse, from, the, corona, a, stellar, wind, of, plasma, particles, expands, outward, from, the, star, until, it, interacts, with, the, interstellar, medium, for, the, sun, the, influence, of, its, solar, wind, extends, throughout, a, bubble, shaped, region, called, the, heliosphere, when, nuclei, fuse, the, mass, of, the, fused, product, is, less, than, the, mass, of, the, original, parts, this, lost, mass, is, converted, to, electromagnetic, energy, according, to, the, mass, energy, equivalence, relationship, e, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, mc, 2, a, variety, of, nuclear, fusion, reactions, take, place, in, the, cores, of, stars, that, depend, upon, their, mass, and, composition, the, hydrogen, fusion, process, is, temperature, sensitive, so, a, moderate, increase, in, the, core, temperature, will, result, in, a, significant, increase, in, the, fusion, rate, as, a, result, the, core, temperature, of, main, sequence, stars, only, varies, from, 4, million, kelvin, for, a, small, m, class, star, to, 40, million, kelvin, for, a, massive, o, class, star, in, the, sun, with, a, 16, million, kelvin, core, hydrogen, fuses, to, form, helium, in, the, proton, proton, chain, reaction, there, are, a, couple, other, paths, in, which, 3, he, and, 4, he, combine, to, form, 7, be, which, eventually, with, the, addition, of, another, proton, yields, two, 4, he, a, gain, of, one, all, these, reactions, result, in, the, overall, reaction, where, is, a, gamma, ray, photon, e, is, a, neutrino, and, h, and, he, are, isotopes, of, hydrogen, and, helium, respectively, the, energy, released, by, this, reaction, is, in, millions, of, electron, volts, each, individual, reaction, produces, only, a, tiny, amount, of, energy, but, because, enormous, numbers, of, these, reactions, occur, constantly, they, produce, all, the, energy, necessary, to, sustain, the, star, s, radiation, output, in, comparison, the, combustion, of, two, hydrogen, gas, molecules, with, one, oxygen, gas, molecule, releases, only, 5, 7, ev, in, more, massive, stars, helium, is, produced, in, a, cycle, of, reactions, catalyzed, by, carbon, called, the, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, cycle, in, evolved, stars, with, cores, at, 100, million, kelvin, and, masses, between, 0, 5, and, 10, m, helium, can, be, transformed, into, carbon, in, the, triple, alpha, process, that, uses, the, intermediate, element, beryllium, for, an, overall, reaction, of, in, massive, stars, heavier, elements, can, be, burned, in, a, contracting, core, through, the, neon, burning, process, and, oxygen, burning, process, the, final, stage, in, the, stellar, nucleosynthesis, process, is, the, silicon, burning, process, that, results, in, the, production, of, the, stable, isotope, iron, 56, any, further, fusion, would, be, an, endothermic, process, that, consumes, energy, and, so, further, energy, can, only, be, produced, through, gravitational, collapse
