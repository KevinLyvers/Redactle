tungsten, also, called, wolfram, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, w, and, atomic, number, 74, it, is, a, rare, metal, found, naturally, on, earth, almost, exclusively, as, compounds, with, other, elements, it, was, identified, as, a, new, element, in, 1781, and, first, isolated, as, a, metal, in, 1783, its, important, ores, include, scheelite, and, wolframite, the, latter, lending, the, element, its, alternative, name, the, free, element, is, remarkable, for, its, robustness, especially, the, fact, that, it, has, the, highest, melting, point, of, all, known, elements, melting, at, 3, 422, c, 6, 192, f, 3, 695, k, it, also, has, the, highest, boiling, point, at, 5, 930, c, 10, 706, f, 6, 203, k, its, density, is, 19, 254, g, cm, 3, comparable, with, that, of, uranium, and, gold, and, much, higher, about, 1, 7, times, than, that, of, lead, polycrystalline, tungsten, is, an, intrinsically, brittle, and, hard, material, under, standard, conditions, when, uncombined, making, it, difficult, to, work, into, metal, however, pure, single, crystalline, tungsten, is, more, ductile, and, can, be, cut, with, a, hard, steel, hacksaw, tungsten, occurs, in, many, alloys, which, have, numerous, applications, including, incandescent, light, bulb, filaments, x, ray, tubes, electrodes, in, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, superalloys, and, radiation, shielding, tungsten, s, hardness, and, high, density, make, it, suitable, for, military, applications, in, penetrating, projectiles, tungsten, compounds, are, often, used, as, industrial, catalysts, its, largest, use, is, in, tungsten, carbide, a, wear, resistant, metal, used, in, metalworking, mining, and, construction, about, 50, of, tungsten, is, used, in, tungsten, carbide, with, the, remaining, major, use, being, alloys, and, steels, less, than, 10, is, used, other, compounds, tungsten, is, the, only, metal, in, the, third, transition, series, that, is, known, to, occur, in, biomolecules, being, found, in, a, few, species, of, bacteria, and, archaea, however, tungsten, interferes, with, molybdenum, and, copper, metabolism, and, is, somewhat, toxic, to, most, forms, of, animal, life, in, its, raw, form, tungsten, is, a, hard, steel, grey, metal, that, is, often, brittle, and, hard, to, work, purified, monocrystalline, tungsten, retains, its, hardness, which, exceeds, that, of, many, steels, and, becomes, malleable, enough, that, it, can, be, worked, easily, it, is, worked, by, forging, drawing, or, extruding, but, it, is, more, commonly, formed, by, sintering, of, all, metals, in, pure, form, tungsten, has, the, highest, melting, point, 3, 422, c, 6, 192, f, lowest, vapor, pressure, at, temperatures, above, 1, 650, c, 3, 000, f, and, the, highest, tensile, strength, although, carbon, remains, solid, at, higher, temperatures, than, tungsten, carbon, sublimes, at, atmospheric, pressure, instead, of, melting, so, it, has, no, melting, point, moreover, tungsten, s, most, stable, crystal, phase, does, not, exhibit, any, high, pressure, induced, structural, transformations, for, pressures, up, to, at, least, 364, gigapascals, tungsten, has, the, lowest, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, of, any, pure, metal, the, low, thermal, expansion, and, high, melting, point, and, tensile, strength, of, tungsten, originate, from, strong, covalent, bonds, formed, between, tungsten, atoms, by, the, 5d, electrons, alloying, small, quantities, of, tungsten, with, steel, greatly, increases, its, toughness, tungsten, exists, in, two, major, crystalline, forms, and, the, former, has, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, and, is, the, more, stable, form, the, structure, of, the, phase, is, called, a15, cubic, it, is, metastable, but, can, coexist, with, the, phase, at, ambient, conditions, owing, to, non, equilibrium, synthesis, or, stabilization, by, impurities, contrary, to, the, phase, which, crystallizes, in, isometric, grains, the, form, exhibits, a, columnar, habit, the, phase, has, one, third, of, the, electrical, resistivity, and, a, much, lower, superconducting, transition, temperature, t, c, relative, to, the, phase, ca, 0, 015, k, vs, 1, 4, k, mixing, the, two, phases, allows, obtaining, intermediate, t, c, values, the, t, c, value, can, also, be, raised, by, alloying, tungsten, with, another, metal, e, g, 7, 9, k, for, w, tc, such, tungsten, alloys, are, sometimes, used, in, low, temperature, superconducting, circuits, naturally, occurring, tungsten, consists, of, four, stable, isotopes, 182, w, 183, w, 184, w, and, 186, w, and, one, very, long, lived, radioisotope, 180, w, theoretically, all, five, can, decay, into, isotopes, of, element, 72, hafnium, by, alpha, emission, but, only, 180, w, has, been, observed, to, do, so, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 8, 0, 2, 10, 18, years, on, average, this, yields, about, two, alpha, decays, of, 180, w, per, gram, of, natural, tungsten, per, year, this, rate, is, equivalent, to, a, specific, activity, of, roughly, 63, micro, becquerel, per, kilogram, this, rate, of, decay, is, orders, of, magnitude, lower, than, that, observed, in, carbon, or, potassium, as, found, on, earth, which, likewise, contain, small, amounts, of, long, lived, radioactive, isotopes, bismuth, was, long, thought, to, be, non, radioactive, but, 209, bi, its, longest, lived, isotope, actually, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 01, 10, 19, years, or, about, a, factor, 10, slower, than, 180, w, however, due, to, naturally, occurring, bismuth, being, 100, 209, bi, its, specific, activity, is, actually, higher, than, that, of, natural, tungsten, at, 3, milli, becquerel, per, kilogram, the, other, naturally, occurring, isotopes, of, tungsten, have, not, been, observed, to, decay, constraining, their, half, lives, to, be, at, least, 4, 10, 21, years, another, 34, artificial, radioisotopes, of, tungsten, have, been, characterized, the, most, stable, of, which, are, 181, w, with, a, half, life, of, 121, 2, days, 185, w, with, a, half, life, of, 75, 1, days, 188, w, with, a, half, life, of, 69, 4, days, 178, w, with, a, half, life, of, 21, 6, days, and, 187, w, with, a, half, life, of, 23, 72, h, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, 3, hours, and, most, of, these, have, half, lives, below, 8, minutes, tungsten, also, has, 11, meta, states, with, the, most, stable, being, 179m, w, t, 1, 2, 6, 4, minutes, tungsten, is, a, mostly, non, reactive, element, it, does, not, react, with, water, is, immune, to, attack, by, most, acids, and, bases, and, does, not, react, with, oxygen, or, air, at, room, temperature, at, elevated, temperatures, i, e, when, red, hot, it, reacts, with, oxygen, to, form, the, trioxide, compound, tungsten, vi, wo, 3, it, will, however, react, directly, with, fluorine, f, 2, at, room, temperature, to, form, tungsten, vi, fluoride, wf, 6, a, colorless, gas, at, around, 250, c, it, will, react, with, chlorine, or, bromine, and, under, certain, hot, conditions, will, react, with, iodine, finely, divided, tungsten, is, pyrophoric, the, most, common, formal, oxidation, state, of, tungsten, is, 6, but, it, exhibits, all, oxidation, states, from, 2, to, 6, tungsten, typically, combines, with, oxygen, to, form, the, yellow, tungstic, oxide, wo, 3, which, dissolves, in, aqueous, alkaline, solutions, to, form, tungstate, ions, wo, 2, 4, tungsten, carbides, w, 2, c, and, wc, are, produced, by, heating, powdered, tungsten, with, carbon, w, 2, c, is, resistant, to, chemical, attack, although, it, reacts, strongly, with, chlorine, to, form, tungsten, hexachloride, wcl, 6, in, aqueous, solution, tungstate, gives, the, heteropoly, acids, and, polyoxometalate, anions, under, neutral, and, acidic, conditions, as, tungstate, is, progressively, treated, with, acid, it, first, yields, the, soluble, metastable, paratungstate, a, anion, w, 7, o, 6, 24, which, over, time, converts, to, the, less, soluble, paratungstate, b, anion, h, 2, w, 12, o, 10, 42, further, acidification, produces, the, very, soluble, metatungstate, anion, h, 2, w, 12, o, 6, 40, after, which, equilibrium, is, reached, the, metatungstate, ion, exists, as, a, symmetric, cluster, of, twelve, tungsten, oxygen, octahedra, known, as, the, keggin, anion, many, other, polyoxometalate, anions, exist, as, metastable, species, the, inclusion, of, a, different, atom, such, as, phosphorus, in, place, of, the, two, central, hydrogens, in, metatungstate, produces, a, wide, variety, of, heteropoly, acids, such, as, phosphotungstic, acid, h, 3, pw, 12, o, 40, tungsten, trioxide, can, form, intercalation, compounds, with, alkali, metals, these, are, known, as, bronzes, an, example, is, sodium, tungsten, bronze, in, gaseous, form, tungsten, forms, the, diatomic, species, w, 2, these, molecules, feature, a, sextuple, bond, between, tungsten, atoms, the, highest, known, bond, order, among, stable, atoms, in, 1781, carl, wilhelm, scheele, discovered, that, a, new, acid, tungstic, acid, could, be, made, from, scheelite, at, the, time, called, tungsten, scheele, and, torbern, bergman, suggested, that, it, might, be, possible, to, obtain, a, new, metal, by, reducing, this, acid, in, 1783, jos, and, fausto, elhuyar, found, an, acid, made, from, wolframite, that, was, identical, to, tungstic, acid, later, that, year, at, the, royal, basque, society, in, the, town, of, bergara, spain, the, brothers, succeeded, in, isolating, tungsten, by, reduction, of, this, acid, with, charcoal, and, they, are, credited, with, the, discovery, of, the, element, they, called, it, wolfram, or, volfram, the, strategic, value, of, tungsten, came, to, notice, in, the, early, 20th, century, british, authorities, acted, in, 1912, to, free, the, carrock, mine, from, the, german, owned, cumbrian, mining, company, and, during, world, war, i, restrict, german, access, elsewhere, in, world, war, ii, tungsten, played, a, more, significant, role, in, background, political, dealings, portugal, as, the, main, european, source, of, the, element, was, put, under, pressure, from, both, sides, because, of, its, deposits, of, wolframite, ore, at, panasqueira, tungsten, s, desirable, properties, such, as, resistance, to, high, temperatures, its, hardness, and, density, and, its, strengthening, of, alloys, made, it, an, important, raw, material, for, the, arms, industry, both, as, a, constituent, of, weapons, and, equipment, and, employed, in, production, itself, e, g, in, tungsten, carbide, cutting, tools, for, machining, steel, now, tungsten, is, used, in, many, more, applications, such, as, aircraft, and, motorsport, ballast, weights, darts, anti, vibration, tooling, and, sporting, equipment, tungsten, is, unique, amongst, the, elements, in, that, it, has, been, the, subject, of, patent, proceedings, in, 1928, a, us, court, rejected, general, electric, s, attempt, to, patent, it, overturning, u, s, patent, 1, 082, 933, granted, in, 1913, to, william, d, coolidge, it, is, suggested, that, remnants, of, wolfram, have, been, found, in, what, may, have, been, the, garden, of, the, astronomer, alchemist, tycho, brahe, the, name, tungsten, which, means, heavy, stone, in, swedish, and, was, the, old, swedish, name, for, the, mineral, scheelite, and, other, minerals, of, similar, density, is, used, in, english, french, and, many, other, languages, as, the, name, of, the, element, but, wolfram, or, volfram, is, used, in, most, european, especially, germanic, and, slavic, languages, and, is, derived, from, the, mineral, wolframite, which, is, the, origin, of, the, chemical, symbol, w, the, name, wolframite, is, derived, from, german, wolf, rahm, wolf, soot, wolf, cream, the, name, given, to, tungsten, by, johan, gottschalk, wallerius, in, 1747, this, in, turn, derives, from, latin, lupi, spuma, the, name, georg, agricola, used, for, the, mineral, in, 1546, which, translates, into, english, as, wolf, s, froth, and, is, a, reference, to, the, large, amounts, of, tin, consumed, by, the, mineral, during, its, extraction, as, though, the, mineral, devoured, it, like, a, wolf, this, naming, follows, a, tradition, of, colorful, names, miners, from, the, ore, mountains, would, give, various, minerals, out, of, a, superstition, that, certain, ones, that, looked, as, if, they, contained, then, known, valuable, metals, but, when, extracted, were, somehow, hexed, cobalt, cf, kobold, pitchblende, cf, german, blenden, for, to, blind, to, deceive, and, nickel, cf, old, nick, derive, their, names, from, the, same, miners, idiom, tungsten, has, thus, far, not, been, found, in, nature, in, its, pure, form, instead, tungsten, is, found, mainly, in, the, minerals, wolframite, and, scheelite, wolframite, is, iron, manganese, tungstate, fe, mn, wo, 4, a, solid, solution, of, the, two, minerals, ferberite, fewo, 4, and, h, bnerite, mnwo, 4, while, scheelite, is, calcium, tungstate, cawo, 4, other, tungsten, minerals, range, in, their, level, of, abundance, from, moderate, to, very, rare, and, have, almost, no, economic, value, tungsten, forms, chemical, compounds, in, oxidation, states, from, ii, to, vi, higher, oxidation, states, always, as, oxides, are, relevant, to, its, terrestrial, occurrence, and, its, biological, roles, mid, level, oxidation, states, are, often, associated, with, metal, clusters, and, very, low, oxidation, states, are, typically, associated, with, co, complexes, the, chemistries, of, tungsten, and, molybdenum, show, strong, similarities, to, each, other, as, well, as, contrasts, with, their, lighter, congener, chromium, the, relative, rarity, of, tungsten, iii, for, example, contrasts, with, the, pervasiveness, of, the, chromium, iii, compounds, the, highest, oxidation, state, is, seen, in, tungsten, vi, oxide, wo, 3, tungsten, vi, oxide, is, soluble, in, aqueous, base, forming, tungstate, wo, 4, 2, this, oxyanion, condenses, at, lower, ph, values, forming, polyoxotungstates, the, broad, range, of, oxidation, states, of, tungsten, is, reflected, in, its, various, chlorides, organotungsten, compounds, are, numerous, and, also, span, a, range, of, oxidation, states, notable, examples, include, the, trigonal, prismatic, w, ch, 3, 6, and, octahedral, w, co, 6, the, world, s, reserves, of, tungsten, are, 3, 200, 000, tonnes, they, are, mostly, located, in, china, 1, 800, 000, t, canada, 290, 000, t, russia, 160, 000, t, vietnam, 95, 000, t, and, bolivia, as, of, 2017, china, vietnam, and, russia, are, the, leading, suppliers, with, 79, 000, 7, 200, and, 3, 100, tonnes, respectively, canada, had, ceased, production, in, late, 2015, due, to, the, closure, of, its, sole, tungsten, mine, meanwhile, vietnam, had, significantly, increased, its, output, in, the, 2010s, owing, to, the, major, optimization, of, its, domestic, refining, operations, and, overtook, russia, and, bolivia, china, remains, the, world, s, leader, not, only, in, production, but, also, in, export, and, consumption, of, tungsten, products, tungsten, production, is, gradually, increasing, outside, china, because, of, the, rising, demand, meanwhile, its, supply, by, china, is, strictly, regulated, by, the, chinese, government, which, fights, illegal, mining, and, excessive, pollution, originating, from, mining, and, refining, processes, there, is, a, large, deposit, of, tungsten, ore, on, the, edge, of, dartmoor, in, the, united, kingdom, which, was, exploited, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, as, the, hemerdon, mine, following, increases, in, tungsten, prices, this, mine, was, reactivated, in, 2014, but, ceased, activities, in, 2018, within, the, eu, the, austrian, felbertal, scheelite, deposit, is, one, of, the, few, producing, tungsten, mines, portugal, is, one, of, europe, s, main, tungsten, producers, with, 121, kt, of, contained, tungsten, in, mineral, concentrates, from, 1910, to, 2020, accounting, for, roughly, 3, 3, of, the, global, production, tungsten, is, considered, to, be, a, conflict, mineral, due, to, the, unethical, mining, practices, observed, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, south, korea, s, sangdong, mine, one, of, the, world, s, largest, tungsten, mines, with, 7, 890, 000, tonnes, of, high, grade, tungsten, reportedly, buried, was, closed, in, 1994, due, to, low, profitability, but, has, since, re, registered, mining, rights, and, is, scheduled, to, resume, activities, in, 2024, tungsten, is, extracted, from, its, ores, in, several, stages, the, ore, is, eventually, converted, to, tungsten, vi, oxide, wo, 3, which, is, heated, with, hydrogen, or, carbon, to, produce, powdered, tungsten, because, of, tungsten, s, high, melting, point, it, is, not, commercially, feasible, to, cast, tungsten, ingots, instead, powdered, tungsten, is, mixed, with, small, amounts, of, powdered, nickel, or, other, metals, and, sintered, during, the, sintering, process, the, nickel, diffuses, into, the, tungsten, producing, an, alloy, tungsten, can, also, be, extracted, by, hydrogen, reduction, of, wf, 6, or, pyrolytic, decomposition, tungsten, is, not, traded, as, a, futures, contract, and, cannot, be, tracked, on, exchanges, like, the, london, metal, exchange, the, tungsten, industry, often, uses, independent, pricing, references, such, as, argus, media, or, metal, bulletin, as, a, basis, for, contracts, the, prices, are, usually, quoted, for, tungsten, concentrate, or, wo, 3, approximately, half, of, the, tungsten, is, consumed, for, the, production, of, hard, materials, namely, tungsten, carbide, with, the, remaining, major, use, being, in, alloys, and, steels, less, than, 10, is, used, in, other, chemical, compounds, because, of, the, high, ductile, brittle, transition, temperature, of, tungsten, its, products, are, conventionally, manufactured, through, powder, metallurgy, spark, plasma, sintering, chemical, vapor, deposition, hot, isostatic, pressing, and, thermoplastic, routes, a, more, flexible, manufacturing, alternative, is, selective, laser, melting, which, is, a, form, of, 3d, printing, and, allows, creating, complex, three, dimensional, shapes, tungsten, is, mainly, used, in, the, production, of, hard, materials, based, on, tungsten, carbide, wc, one, of, the, hardest, carbides, wc, is, an, efficient, electrical, conductor, but, w, 2, c, is, less, so, wc, is, used, to, make, wear, resistant, abrasives, and, carbide, cutting, tools, such, as, knives, drills, circular, saws, dies, milling, and, turning, tools, used, by, the, metalworking, woodworking, mining, petroleum, and, construction, industries, carbide, tooling, is, actually, a, ceramic, metal, composite, where, metallic, cobalt, acts, as, a, binding, matrix, material, to, hold, the, wc, particles, in, place, this, type, of, industrial, use, accounts, for, about, 60, of, current, tungsten, consumption, the, jewelry, industry, makes, rings, of, sintered, tungsten, carbide, tungsten, carbide, metal, composites, and, also, metallic, tungsten, wc, metal, composite, rings, use, nickel, as, the, metal, matrix, in, place, of, cobalt, because, it, takes, a, higher, luster, when, polished, sometimes, manufacturers, or, retailers, refer, to, tungsten, carbide, as, a, metal, but, it, is, a, ceramic, because, of, tungsten, carbide, s, hardness, rings, made, of, this, material, are, extremely, abrasion, resistant, and, will, hold, a, burnished, finish, longer, than, rings, made, of, metallic, tungsten, tungsten, carbide, rings, are, brittle, however, and, may, crack, under, a, sharp, blow, the, hardness, and, heat, resistance, of, tungsten, can, contribute, to, useful, alloys, a, good, example, is, high, speed, steel, which, can, contain, as, much, as, 18, tungsten, tungsten, s, high, melting, point, makes, tungsten, a, good, material, for, applications, like, rocket, nozzles, for, example, in, the, ugm, 27, polaris, submarine, launched, ballistic, missile, tungsten, alloys, are, used, in, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, the, aerospace, and, automotive, industries, and, radiation, shielding, superalloys, containing, tungsten, such, as, hastelloy, and, stellite, are, used, in, turbine, blades, and, wear, resistant, parts, and, coatings, tungsten, s, heat, resistance, makes, it, useful, in, arc, welding, applications, when, combined, with, another, highly, conductive, metal, such, as, silver, or, copper, the, silver, or, copper, provides, the, necessary, conductivity, and, the, tungsten, allows, the, welding, rod, to, withstand, the, high, temperatures, of, the, arc, welding, environment, quenched, martensitic, tungsten, steel, approx, 5, 5, to, 7, 0, w, with, 0, 5, to, 0, 7, c, was, used, for, making, hard, permanent, magnets, due, to, its, high, remanence, and, coercivity, as, noted, by, john, hopkinson, 1849, 1898, as, early, as, 1886, the, magnetic, properties, of, a, metal, or, an, alloy, are, very, sensitive, to, microstructure, for, example, while, the, element, tungsten, is, not, ferromagnetic, but, iron, is, when, it, is, present, in, steel, in, these, proportions, it, stabilizes, the, martensite, phase, which, has, greater, ferromagnetism, than, the, ferrite, iron, phase, due, to, its, greater, resistance, to, magnetic, domain, wall, motion, tungsten, usually, alloyed, with, nickel, iron, or, cobalt, to, form, heavy, alloys, is, used, in, kinetic, energy, penetrators, as, an, alternative, to, depleted, uranium, in, applications, where, uranium, s, radioactivity, is, problematic, even, in, depleted, form, or, where, uranium, s, additional, pyrophoric, properties, are, not, desired, for, example, in, ordinary, small, arms, bullets, designed, to, penetrate, body, armor, similarly, tungsten, alloys, have, also, been, used, in, shells, grenades, and, missiles, to, create, supersonic, shrapnel, germany, used, tungsten, during, world, war, ii, to, produce, shells, for, anti, tank, gun, designs, using, the, gerlich, squeeze, bore, principle, to, achieve, very, high, muzzle, velocity, and, enhanced, armor, penetration, from, comparatively, small, caliber, and, light, weight, field, artillery, the, weapons, were, highly, effective, but, a, shortage, of, tungsten, used, in, the, shell, core, caused, in, part, by, the, wolfram, crisis, limited, their, use, tungsten, has, also, been, used, in, dense, inert, metal, explosives, which, use, it, as, dense, powder, to, reduce, collateral, damage, while, increasing, the, lethality, of, explosives, within, a, small, radius, tungsten, iv, sulfide, is, a, high, temperature, lubricant, and, is, a, component, of, catalysts, for, hydrodesulfurization, mos, 2, is, more, commonly, used, for, such, applications, tungsten, oxides, are, used, in, ceramic, glazes, and, calcium, magnesium, tungstates, are, used, widely, in, fluorescent, lighting, crystal, tungstates, are, used, as, scintillation, detectors, in, nuclear, physics, and, nuclear, medicine, other, salts, that, contain, tungsten, are, used, in, the, chemical, and, tanning, industries, tungsten, oxide, wo, 3, is, incorporated, into, selective, catalytic, reduction, scr, catalysts, found, in, coal, fired, power, plants, these, catalysts, convert, nitrogen, oxides, no, x, to, nitrogen, n, 2, and, water, h, 2, o, using, ammonia, nh, 3, the, tungsten, oxide, helps, with, the, physical, strength, of, the, catalyst, and, extends, catalyst, life, tungsten, containing, catalysts, are, promising, for, epoxidation, oxidation, and, hydrogenolysis, reactions, tungsten, heteropoly, acids, are, key, component, of, multifunctional, catalysts, tungstates, can, be, used, as, photocatalyst, while, the, tungsten, sulfide, as, electrocatalyst, applications, requiring, its, high, density, include, weights, counterweights, ballast, keels, for, yachts, tail, ballast, for, commercial, aircraft, rotor, weights, for, civil, and, military, helicopters, and, as, ballast, in, race, cars, for, nascar, and, formula, one, being, slightly, less, than, twice, the, density, tungsten, is, seen, as, an, alternative, albeit, more, expensive, to, lead, fishing, sinkers, depleted, uranium, is, also, used, for, these, purposes, due, to, similarly, high, density, seventy, five, kg, blocks, of, tungsten, were, used, as, cruise, balance, mass, devices, on, the, entry, vehicle, portion, of, the, 2012, mars, science, laboratory, spacecraft, it, is, an, ideal, material, to, use, as, a, dolly, for, riveting, where, the, mass, necessary, for, good, results, can, be, achieved, in, a, compact, bar, high, density, alloys, of, tungsten, with, nickel, copper, or, iron, are, used, in, high, quality, darts, to, allow, for, a, smaller, diameter, and, thus, tighter, groupings, or, for, artificial, flies, tungsten, beads, allow, the, fly, to, sink, rapidly,
