landslides, also, known, as, landslips, or, rockslides, are, several, forms, of, mass, wasting, that, may, include, a, wide, range, of, ground, movements, such, as, rockfalls, mudflows, shallow, or, deep, seated, slope, failures, and, debris, flows, landslides, occur, in, a, variety, of, environments, characterized, by, either, steep, or, gentle, slope, gradients, from, mountain, ranges, to, coastal, cliffs, or, even, underwater, in, which, case, they, are, called, submarine, landslides, gravity, is, the, primary, driving, force, for, a, landslide, to, occur, but, there, are, other, factors, affecting, slope, stability, that, produce, specific, conditions, that, make, a, slope, prone, to, failure, in, many, cases, the, landslide, is, triggered, by, a, specific, event, such, as, a, heavy, rainfall, an, earthquake, a, slope, cut, to, build, a, road, and, many, others, although, this, is, not, always, identifiable, landslides, are, frequently, made, worse, by, human, development, such, as, urban, sprawl, and, resource, exploitation, such, as, mining, and, deforestation, land, degradation, frequently, leads, to, less, stabilization, of, soil, by, vegetation, additionally, global, warming, caused, by, climate, change, and, other, human, impact, on, the, environment, can, increase, the, frequency, of, natural, events, such, as, extreme, weather, which, trigger, landslides, landslide, mitigation, describes, the, policy, and, practices, for, reducing, the, risk, of, human, impacts, of, landslides, reducing, the, risk, of, natural, disaster, landslides, occur, when, the, slope, or, a, portion, of, it, undergoes, some, processes, that, change, its, condition, from, stable, to, unstable, this, is, essentially, due, to, a, decrease, in, the, shear, strength, of, the, slope, material, an, increase, in, the, shear, stress, borne, by, the, material, or, a, combination, of, the, two, a, change, in, the, stability, of, a, slope, can, be, caused, by, a, number, of, factors, acting, together, or, alone, natural, causes, of, landslides, include, landslides, are, aggravated, by, human, activities, such, as, in, traditional, usage, the, term, landslide, has, at, one, time, or, another, been, used, to, cover, almost, all, forms, of, mass, movement, of, rocks, and, regolith, at, the, earth, s, surface, in, 1978, geologist, david, varnes, noted, this, imprecise, usage, and, proposed, a, new, much, tighter, scheme, for, the, classification, of, mass, movements, and, subsidence, processes, this, scheme, was, later, modified, by, cruden, and, varnes, in, 1996, and, refined, by, hutchinson, 1988, hungr, et, al, 2001, and, finally, by, hungr, leroueil, and, picarelli, 2014, the, classification, resulting, from, the, latest, update, is, provided, below, under, this, classification, six, types, of, movement, are, recognized, each, type, can, be, seen, both, in, rock, and, in, soil, a, fall, is, a, movement, of, isolated, blocks, or, chunks, of, soil, in, free, fall, the, term, topple, refers, to, blocks, coming, away, by, rotation, from, a, vertical, face, a, slide, is, the, movement, of, a, body, of, material, that, generally, remains, intact, while, moving, over, one, or, several, inclined, surfaces, or, thin, layers, of, material, also, called, shear, zones, in, which, large, deformations, are, concentrated, slides, are, also, sub, classified, by, the, form, of, the, surface, s, or, shear, zone, s, on, which, movement, happens, the, planes, may, be, broadly, parallel, to, the, surface, planar, slides, or, spoon, shaped, rotational, slides, slides, can, occur, catastrophically, but, movement, on, the, surface, can, also, be, gradual, and, progressive, spreads, are, a, form, of, subsidence, in, which, a, layer, of, material, cracks, opens, up, and, expands, laterally, flows, are, the, movement, of, fluidised, material, which, can, be, both, dry, or, rich, in, water, such, as, in, mud, flows, flows, can, move, imperceptibly, for, years, or, accelerate, rapidly, and, cause, disasters, slope, deformations, are, slow, distributed, movements, that, can, affect, entire, mountain, slopes, or, portions, of, it, some, landslides, are, complex, in, the, sense, that, they, feature, different, movement, types, in, different, portions, of, the, moving, body, or, they, evolve, from, one, movement, type, to, another, over, time, for, example, a, landslide, can, initiate, as, a, rock, fall, or, topple, and, then, as, the, blocks, disintegrate, upon, the, impact, transform, into, a, debris, slide, or, flow, an, avalanching, effect, can, also, be, present, in, which, the, moving, mass, entrains, additional, material, along, its, path, slope, material, that, becomes, saturated, with, water, may, produce, a, debris, flow, or, mud, flow, however, also, dry, debris, can, exhibit, flow, like, movement, flowing, debris, or, mud, may, pick, up, trees, houses, and, cars, and, block, bridges, and, rivers, causing, flooding, along, its, path, this, phenomenon, is, particularly, hazardous, in, alpine, areas, where, narrow, gorges, and, steep, valleys, are, conducive, of, faster, flows, debris, and, mud, flows, may, initiate, on, the, slopes, or, result, from, the, fluidization, of, landslide, material, as, it, gains, speed, or, incorporates, further, debris, and, water, along, its, path, river, blockages, as, the, flow, reaches, a, main, stream, can, generate, temporary, dams, as, the, impoundments, fail, a, domino, effect, may, be, created, with, a, remarkable, growth, in, the, volume, of, the, flowing, mass, and, in, its, destructive, power, an, earthflow, is, the, downslope, movement, of, mostly, fine, grained, material, earthflows, can, move, at, speeds, within, a, very, wide, range, from, as, low, as, 1, mm, yr, to, many, km, h, though, these, are, a, lot, like, mudflows, overall, they, are, more, slow, moving, and, are, covered, with, solid, material, carried, along, by, the, flow, from, within, clay, fine, sand, and, silt, and, fine, grained, pyroclastic, material, are, all, susceptible, to, earthflows, these, flows, are, usually, controlled, by, the, pore, water, pressures, within, the, mass, which, should, be, high, enough, to, produce, a, low, shearing, resistance, on, the, slopes, some, earthflow, may, be, recognized, by, their, elongated, shape, with, one, or, more, lobes, at, their, toes, as, these, lobes, spread, out, drainage, of, the, mass, increases, and, the, margins, dry, out, lowering, the, overall, velocity, of, the, flow, this, process, also, causes, the, flow, to, thicken, earthflows, occur, more, often, during, periods, of, high, precipitation, which, saturates, the, ground, and, builds, up, water, pressures, however, earthflows, that, keep, advancing, also, during, dry, seasons, are, not, uncommon, fissures, may, develop, during, the, movement, of, clayey, materials, which, facilitate, the, intrusion, of, water, into, the, moving, mass, and, produce, faster, responses, to, precipitation, a, rock, avalanche, sometimes, referred, to, as, sturzstrom, is, a, large, and, fast, moving, landslide, of, the, flow, type, it, is, rarer, than, other, types, of, landslides, but, it, is, often, very, destructive, it, exhibits, typically, a, long, runout, flowing, very, far, over, a, low, angle, flat, or, even, slightly, uphill, terrain, the, mechanisms, favoring, the, long, runout, can, be, different, but, they, typically, result, in, the, weakening, of, the, sliding, mass, as, the, speed, increases, the, causes, of, this, weakening, are, not, completely, understood, especially, for, the, largest, landslides, it, may, involve, the, very, quick, heating, of, the, shear, zone, due, to, friction, which, may, even, cause, the, water, that, is, present, to, vaporize, and, build, up, a, large, pressure, producing, a, sort, of, hovercraft, effect, in, some, cases, the, very, high, temperature, may, even, cause, some, of, the, minerals, to, melt, during, the, movement, the, rock, in, the, shear, zone, may, also, be, finely, ground, producing, a, nanometer, size, mineral, powder, that, may, act, as, a, lubricant, reducing, the, resistance, to, motion, and, promoting, larger, speeds, and, longer, runouts, the, weakening, mechanisms, in, large, rock, avalanches, are, similar, to, those, occurring, in, seismic, faults, slides, can, occur, in, any, rock, or, soil, material, and, are, characterized, by, the, movement, of, a, mass, over, a, planar, or, curvilinear, surface, or, shear, zone, a, debris, slide, is, a, type, of, slide, characterized, by, the, chaotic, movement, of, material, mixed, with, water, and, or, ice, it, is, usually, triggered, by, the, saturation, of, thickly, vegetated, slopes, which, results, in, an, incoherent, mixture, of, broken, timber, smaller, vegetation, and, other, debris, debris, flows, and, avalanches, differ, from, debris, slides, because, their, movement, is, fluid, like, and, generally, much, more, rapid, this, is, usually, a, result, of, lower, shear, resistances, and, steeper, slopes, typically, debris, slides, start, with, the, detachment, of, large, rock, fragments, high, on, the, slopes, which, break, apart, as, they, descend, clay, and, silt, slides, are, usually, slow, but, can, experience, episodic, acceleration, in, response, to, heavy, rainfall, or, rapid, snowmelt, they, are, often, seen, on, gentle, slopes, and, move, over, planar, surfaces, such, as, over, the, underlying, bedrock, failure, surfaces, can, also, form, within, the, clay, or, silt, layer, itself, and, they, usually, have, concave, shapes, resulting, in, rotational, slides, slope, failure, mechanisms, often, contain, large, uncertainties, and, could, be, significantly, affected, by, heterogeneity, of, soil, properties, a, landslide, in, which, the, sliding, surface, is, located, within, the, soil, mantle, or, weathered, bedrock, typically, to, a, depth, from, few, decimeters, to, some, meters, is, called, a, shallow, landslide, debris, slides, and, debris, flows, are, usually, shallow, shallow, landslides, can, often, happen, in, areas, that, have, slopes, with, high, permeable, soils, on, top, of, low, permeable, soils, the, low, permeable, soil, traps, the, water, in, the, shallower, soil, generating, high, water, pressures, as, the, top, soil, is, filled, with, water, it, can, become, unstable, and, slide, downslope, deep, seated, landslides, are, those, in, which, the, sliding, surface, is, mostly, deeply, located, for, instance, well, below, the, maximum, rooting, depth, of, trees, they, usually, involve, deep, regolith, weathered, rock, and, or, bedrock, and, include, large, slope, failures, associated, with, translational, rotational, or, complex, movements, they, tend, to, form, along, a, plane, of, weakness, such, as, a, fault, or, bedding, plane, they, can, be, visually, identified, by, concave, scarps, at, the, top, and, steep, areas, at, the, toe, deep, seated, landslides, also, shape, landscapes, over, geological, timescales, and, produce, sediment, that, strongly, alters, the, course, of, fluvial, streams, landslides, that, occur, undersea, or, have, impact, into, water, e, g, significant, rockfall, or, volcanic, collapse, into, the, sea, can, generate, tsunamis, massive, landslides, can, also, generate, megatsunamis, which, are, usually, hundreds, of, meters, high, in, 1958, one, such, tsunami, occurred, in, lituya, bay, in, alaska, landslide, hazard, analysis, and, mapping, can, provide, useful, information, for, catastrophic, loss, reduction, and, assist, in, the, development, of, guidelines, for, sustainable, land, use, planning, the, analysis, is, used, to, identify, the, factors, that, are, related, to, landslides, estimate, the, relative, contribution, of, factors, causing, slope, failures, establish, a, relation, between, the, factors, and, landslides, and, to, predict, the, landslide, hazard, in, the, future, based, on, such, a, relationship, the, factors, that, have, been, used, for, landslide, hazard, analysis, can, usually, be, grouped, into, geomorphology, geology, land, use, land, cover, and, hydrogeology, since, many, factors, are, considered, for, landslide, hazard, mapping, gis, is, an, appropriate, tool, because, it, has, functions, of, collection, storage, manipulation, display, and, analysis, of, large, amounts, of, spatially, referenced, data, which, can, be, handled, fast, and, effectively, cardenas, reported, evidence, on, the, exhaustive, use, of, gis, in, conjunction, of, uncertainty, modelling, tools, for, landslide, mapping, remote, sensing, techniques, are, also, highly, employed, for, landslide, hazard, assessment, and, analysis, before, and, after, aerial, photographs, and, satellite, imagery, are, used, to, gather, landslide, characteristics, like, distribution, and, classification, and, factors, like, slope, lithology, and, land, use, land, cover, to, be, used, to, help, predict, future, events, before, and, after, imagery, also, helps, to, reveal, how, the, landscape, changed, after, an, event, what, may, have, triggered, the, landslide, and, shows, the, process, of, regeneration, and, recovery, using, satellite, imagery, in, combination, with, gis, and, on, the, ground, studies, it, is, possible, to, generate, maps, of, likely, occurrences, of, future, landslides, such, maps, should, show, the, locations, of, previous, events, as, well, as, clearly, indicate, the, probable, locations, of, future, events, in, general, to, predict, landslides, one, must, assume, that, their, occurrence, is, determined, by, certain, geologic, factors, and, that, future, landslides, will, occur, under, the, same, conditions, as, past, events, therefore, it, is, necessary, to, establish, a, relationship, between, the, geomorphologic, conditions, in, which, the, past, events, took, place, and, the, expected, future, conditions, natural, disasters, are, a, dramatic, example, of, people, living, in, conflict, with, the, environment, early, predictions, and, warnings, are, essential, for, the, reduction, of, property, damage, and, loss, of, life, because, landslides, occur, frequently, and, can, represent, some, of, the, most, destructive, forces, on, earth, it, is, imperative, to, have, a, good, understanding, as, to, what, causes, them, and, how, people, can, either, help, prevent, them, from, occurring, or, simply, avoid, them, when, they, do, occur, sustainable, land, management, and, development, is, also, an, essential, key, to, reducing, the, negative, impacts, felt, by, landslides, gis, offers, a, superior, method, for, landslide, analysis, because, it, allows, one, to, capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and, display, large, amounts, of, data, quickly, and, effectively, because, so, many, variables, are, involved, it, is, important, to, be, able, to, overlay, the, many, layers, of, data, to, develop, a, full, and, accurate, portrayal, of, what, is, taking, place, on, the, earth, s, surface, researchers, need, to, know, which, variables, are, the, most, important, factors, that, trigger, landslides, in, any, given, location, using, gis, extremely, detailed, maps, can, be, generated, to, show, past, events, and, likely, future, events, which, have, the, potential, to, save, lives, property, and, money, since, the, 90s, gis, have, been, also, successfully, used, in, conjunction, to, decision, support, systems, to, show, on, a, map, real, time, risk, evaluations, based, on, monitoring, data, gathered, in, the, area, of, the, val, pola, disaster, italy, evidence, of, past, landslides, has, been, detected, on, many, bodies, in, the, solar, system, but, since, most, observations, are, made, by, probes, that, only, observe, for, a, limited, time, and, most, bodies, in, the, solar, system, appear, to, be, geologically, inactive, not, many, landslides, are, known, to, have, happened, in, recent, times, both, venus, and, mars, have, been, subject, to, long, term, mapping, by, orbiting, satellites, and, examples, of, landslides, have, been, observed, on, both, planets, landslide, mitigation, refers, to, several, human, made, activities, on, slopes, with, the, goal, of, lessening, the, effect, of, landslides, landslides, can, be, triggered, by, many, sometimes, concomitant, causes, in, addition, to, shallow, erosion, or, reduction, of, shear, strength, caused, by, seasonal, rainfall, landslides, may, be, triggered, by, anthropic, activities, such, as, adding, excessive, weight, above, the, slope, digging, at, mid, slope, or, at, the, foot, of, the, slope, often, individual, phenomena, join, to, generate, instability, over, time, which, often, does, not, allow, a, reconstruction, of, the, evolution, of, a, particular, landslide, therefore, landslide, hazard, mitigation, measures, are, not, generally, classified, according, to, the, phenomenon, that, might, cause, a, landslide, instead, they, are, classified, by, the, sort, of, slope, stabilization, method, used, climate, change, impact, on, temperature, both, average, rainfall, and, rainfall, extremes, and, evapotranspiration, may, affect, landslide, distribution, frequency, and, intensity, 62, however, this, impact, shows, strong, variability, in, different, areas, 63, therefore, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, landslides, need, to, be, studied, on, a, regional, scale, climate, change, can, have, both, positive, and, negative, impacts, on, landslides, temperature, rise, may, increase, evapotranspiration, leading, to, a, reduction, in, soil, moisture, and, stimulate, vegetation, growth, also, due, to, a, co2, increase, in, the, atmosphere, both, effects, may, reduce, landslides, in, some, conditions, on, the, other, side, temperature, rise, causes, an, increase, of, landslides, due, to, since, the, average, precipitation, is, expected, to, decrease, or, increase, regionally, 63, rainfall, induced, landslides, may, change, accordingly, due, to, changes, in, infiltration, groundwater, levels, and, river, bank, erosion, weather, extremes, are, expected, to, increase, due, to, climate, change, including, heavy, precipitation, 63, this, yields, negative, effects, on, landslides, due, to, focused, infiltration, in, soil, and, rock, 66, and, an, increase, of, runoff, events, which, may, trigger, debris, flows
