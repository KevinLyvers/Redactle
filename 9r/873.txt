solid, state, physics, is, the, study, of, rigid, matter, or, solids, through, methods, such, as, solid, state, chemistry, quantum, mechanics, crystallography, electromagnetism, and, metallurgy, it, is, the, largest, branch, of, condensed, matter, physics, solid, state, physics, studies, how, the, large, scale, properties, of, solid, materials, result, from, their, atomic, scale, properties, thus, solid, state, physics, forms, a, theoretical, basis, of, materials, science, along, with, solid, state, chemistry, it, also, has, direct, applications, in, the, technology, of, transistors, and, semiconductors, solid, materials, are, formed, from, densely, packed, atoms, which, interact, intensely, these, interactions, produce, the, mechanical, e, g, hardness, and, elasticity, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and, optical, properties, of, solids, depending, on, the, material, involved, and, the, conditions, in, which, it, was, formed, the, atoms, may, be, arranged, in, a, regular, geometric, pattern, crystalline, solids, which, include, metals, and, ordinary, water, ice, or, irregularly, an, amorphous, solid, such, as, common, window, glass, the, bulk, of, solid, state, physics, as, a, general, theory, is, focused, on, crystals, primarily, this, is, because, the, periodicity, of, atoms, in, a, crystal, its, defining, characteristic, facilitates, mathematical, modeling, likewise, crystalline, materials, often, have, electrical, magnetic, optical, or, mechanical, properties, that, can, be, exploited, for, engineering, purposes, the, forces, between, the, atoms, in, a, crystal, can, take, a, variety, of, forms, for, example, in, a, crystal, of, sodium, chloride, common, salt, the, crystal, is, made, up, of, ionic, sodium, and, chlorine, and, held, together, with, ionic, bonds, in, others, the, atoms, share, electrons, and, form, covalent, bonds, in, metals, electrons, are, shared, amongst, the, whole, crystal, in, metallic, bonding, finally, the, noble, gases, do, not, undergo, any, of, these, types, of, bonding, in, solid, form, the, noble, gases, are, held, together, with, van, der, waals, forces, resulting, from, the, polarisation, of, the, electronic, charge, cloud, on, each, atom, the, differences, between, the, types, of, solid, result, from, the, differences, between, their, bonding, the, physical, properties, of, solids, have, been, common, subjects, of, scientific, inquiry, for, centuries, but, a, separate, field, going, by, the, name, of, solid, state, physics, did, not, emerge, until, the, 1940s, in, particular, with, the, establishment, of, the, division, of, solid, state, physics, dssp, within, the, american, physical, society, the, dssp, catered, to, industrial, physicists, and, solid, state, physics, became, associated, with, the, technological, applications, made, possible, by, research, on, solids, by, the, early, 1960s, the, dssp, was, the, largest, division, of, the, american, physical, society, large, communities, of, solid, state, physicists, also, emerged, in, europe, after, world, war, ii, in, particular, in, england, germany, and, the, soviet, union, in, the, united, states, and, europe, solid, state, became, a, prominent, field, through, its, investigations, into, semiconductors, superconductivity, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, and, diverse, other, phenomena, during, the, early, cold, war, research, in, solid, state, physics, was, often, not, restricted, to, solids, which, led, some, physicists, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, to, found, the, field, of, condensed, matter, physics, which, organized, around, common, techniques, used, to, investigate, solids, liquids, plasmas, and, other, complex, matter, today, solid, state, physics, is, broadly, considered, to, be, the, subfield, of, condensed, matter, physics, often, referred, to, as, hard, condensed, matter, that, focuses, on, the, properties, of, solids, with, regular, crystal, lattices, many, properties, of, materials, are, affected, by, their, crystal, structure, this, structure, can, be, investigated, using, a, range, of, crystallographic, techniques, including, x, ray, crystallography, neutron, diffraction, and, electron, diffraction, the, sizes, of, the, individual, crystals, in, a, crystalline, solid, material, vary, depending, on, the, material, involved, and, the, conditions, when, it, was, formed, most, crystalline, materials, encountered, in, everyday, life, are, polycrystalline, with, the, individual, crystals, being, microscopic, in, scale, but, macroscopic, single, crystals, can, be, produced, either, naturally, e, g, diamonds, or, artificially, real, crystals, feature, defects, or, irregularities, in, the, ideal, arrangements, and, it, is, these, defects, that, critically, determine, many, of, the, electrical, and, mechanical, properties, of, real, materials, properties, of, materials, such, as, electrical, conduction, and, heat, capacity, are, investigated, by, solid, state, physics, an, early, model, of, electrical, conduction, was, the, drude, model, which, applied, kinetic, theory, to, the, electrons, in, a, solid, by, assuming, that, the, material, contains, immobile, positive, ions, and, an, electron, gas, of, classical, non, interacting, electrons, the, drude, model, was, able, to, explain, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, and, the, hall, effect, in, metals, although, it, greatly, overestimated, the, electronic, heat, capacity, arnold, sommerfeld, combined, the, classical, drude, model, with, quantum, mechanics, in, the, free, electron, model, or, drude, sommerfeld, model, here, the, electrons, are, modelled, as, a, fermi, gas, a, gas, of, particles, which, obey, the, quantum, mechanical, fermi, dirac, statistics, the, free, electron, model, gave, improved, predictions, for, the, heat, capacity, of, metals, however, it, was, unable, to, explain, the, existence, of, insulators, the, nearly, free, electron, model, is, a, modification, of, the, free, electron, model, which, includes, a, weak, periodic, perturbation, meant, to, model, the, interaction, between, the, conduction, electrons, and, the, ions, in, a, crystalline, solid, by, introducing, the, idea, of, electronic, bands, the, theory, explains, the, existence, of, conductors, semiconductors, and, insulators, the, nearly, free, electron, model, rewrites, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, the, case, of, a, periodic, potential, the, solutions, in, this, case, are, known, as, bloch, states, since, bloch, s, theorem, applies, only, to, periodic, potentials, and, since, unceasing, random, movements, of, atoms, in, a, crystal, disrupt, periodicity, this, use, of, bloch, s, theorem, is, only, an, approximation, but, it, has, proven, to, be, a, tremendously, valuable, approximation, without, which, most, solid, state, physics, analysis, would, be, intractable, deviations, from, periodicity, are, treated, by, quantum, mechanical, perturbation, theory, modern, research, topics, in, solid, state, physics, include
