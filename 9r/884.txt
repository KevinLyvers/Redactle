degenerate, matter, occurs, when, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, significantly, alters, a, state, of, matter, at, low, temperature, the, term, is, used, in, astrophysics, to, refer, to, dense, stellar, objects, such, as, white, dwarfs, and, neutron, stars, where, thermal, pressure, alone, is, not, enough, to, avoid, gravitational, collapse, the, term, also, applies, to, metals, in, the, fermi, gas, approximation, degenerate, matter, is, usually, modelled, as, an, ideal, fermi, gas, an, ensemble, of, non, interacting, fermions, in, a, quantum, mechanical, description, particles, limited, to, a, finite, volume, may, take, only, a, discrete, set, of, energies, called, quantum, states, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, prevents, identical, fermions, from, occupying, the, same, quantum, state, at, lowest, total, energy, when, the, thermal, energy, of, the, particles, is, negligible, all, the, lowest, energy, quantum, states, are, filled, this, state, is, referred, to, as, full, degeneracy, this, degeneracy, pressure, remains, non, zero, even, at, absolute, zero, temperature, adding, particles, or, reducing, the, volume, forces, the, particles, into, higher, energy, quantum, states, in, this, situation, a, compression, force, is, required, and, is, made, manifest, as, a, resisting, pressure, the, key, feature, is, that, this, degeneracy, pressure, does, not, depend, on, the, temperature, but, only, on, the, density, of, the, fermions, degeneracy, pressure, keeps, dense, stars, in, equilibrium, independent, of, the, thermal, structure, of, the, star, a, degenerate, mass, whose, fermions, have, velocities, close, to, the, speed, of, light, particle, kinetic, energy, larger, than, its, rest, mass, energy, is, called, relativistic, degenerate, matter, the, concept, of, degenerate, stars, stellar, objects, composed, of, degenerate, matter, was, originally, developed, in, a, joint, effort, between, arthur, eddington, ralph, fowler, and, arthur, milne, eddington, had, suggested, that, the, atoms, in, sirius, b, were, almost, completely, ionised, and, closely, packed, fowler, described, white, dwarfs, as, composed, of, a, gas, of, particles, that, became, degenerate, at, low, temperature, he, also, pointed, out, that, ordinary, atoms, are, broadly, similar, in, regards, to, the, filling, of, energy, levels, by, fermions, milne, proposed, that, degenerate, matter, is, found, in, most, of, the, nuclei, of, stars, not, only, in, compact, stars, degenerate, matter, exhibits, quantum, mechanical, properties, when, a, fermion, system, temperature, approaches, absolute, zero, 30, these, properties, result, from, a, combination, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, and, quantum, confinement, the, pauli, principle, allows, only, one, fermion, in, each, quantum, state, and, the, confinement, ensures, that, energy, of, these, states, increases, as, they, are, filled, the, lowest, states, fill, up, and, fermions, are, forced, to, occupy, high, energy, states, even, at, low, temperature, while, the, pauli, principle, and, fermi, dirac, distribution, applies, to, all, matter, the, interesting, cases, for, degenerate, matter, involve, systems, of, many, fermions, these, cases, can, be, understood, with, the, help, of, the, fermi, gas, model, examples, include, electrons, in, metals, and, in, white, dwarf, stars, and, neutrons, in, neutron, stars, 436, the, electrons, are, confined, by, coulomb, attraction, to, positive, ion, cores, the, neutrons, are, confined, by, gravitation, attraction, the, fermions, forced, in, to, higher, levels, by, the, pauli, principle, exert, pressure, preventing, further, compression, the, allocation, or, distribution, of, fermions, into, quantum, states, ranked, by, energy, is, called, the, fermi, dirac, distribution, 30, degenerate, matter, exhibits, the, results, of, fermi, dirac, distribution, unlike, a, classical, ideal, gas, whose, pressure, is, proportional, to, its, temperature, p, k, b, n, t, v, displaystyle, p, k, rm, b, frac, nt, v, where, p, is, pressure, k, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, n, is, the, number, of, particles, typically, atoms, or, molecules, t, is, temperature, and, v, is, the, volume, the, pressure, exerted, by, degenerate, matter, depends, only, weakly, on, its, temperature, in, particular, the, pressure, remains, nonzero, even, at, absolute, zero, temperature, at, relatively, low, densities, the, pressure, of, a, fully, degenerate, gas, can, be, derived, by, treating, the, system, as, an, ideal, fermi, gas, in, this, way, p, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, m, n, v, 5, 3, displaystyle, p, frac, 3, pi, 2, 2, 3, hbar, 2, 5m, left, frac, n, v, right, 5, 3, where, m, is, the, mass, of, the, individual, particles, making, up, the, gas, at, very, high, densities, where, most, of, the, particles, are, forced, into, quantum, states, with, relativistic, energies, the, pressure, is, given, by, p, k, n, v, 4, 3, displaystyle, p, k, left, frac, n, v, right, 4, 3, where, k, is, another, proportionality, constant, depending, on, the, properties, of, the, particles, making, up, the, gas, all, matter, experiences, both, normal, thermal, pressure, and, degeneracy, pressure, but, in, commonly, encountered, gases, thermal, pressure, dominates, so, much, that, degeneracy, pressure, can, be, ignored, likewise, degenerate, matter, still, has, normal, thermal, pressure, the, degeneracy, pressure, dominates, to, the, point, that, temperature, has, a, negligible, effect, on, the, total, pressure, the, adjacent, figure, shows, the, thermal, pressure, red, line, and, total, pressure, blue, line, in, a, fermi, gas, with, the, difference, between, the, two, being, the, degeneracy, pressure, as, the, temperature, falls, the, density, and, the, degeneracy, pressure, increase, until, the, degeneracy, pressure, contributes, most, of, the, total, pressure, while, degeneracy, pressure, usually, dominates, at, extremely, high, densities, it, is, the, ratio, between, degenerate, pressure, and, thermal, pressure, which, determines, degeneracy, given, a, sufficiently, drastic, increase, in, temperature, such, as, during, a, red, giant, star, s, helium, flash, matter, can, become, non, degenerate, without, reducing, its, density, degeneracy, pressure, contributes, to, the, pressure, of, conventional, solids, but, these, are, not, usually, considered, to, be, degenerate, matter, because, a, significant, contribution, to, their, pressure, is, provided, by, electrical, repulsion, of, atomic, nuclei, and, the, screening, of, nuclei, from, each, other, by, electrons, the, free, electron, model, of, metals, derives, their, physical, properties, by, considering, the, conduction, electrons, alone, as, a, degenerate, gas, while, the, majority, of, the, electrons, are, regarded, as, occupying, bound, quantum, states, this, solid, state, contrasts, with, degenerate, matter, that, forms, the, body, of, a, white, dwarf, where, most, of, the, electrons, would, be, treated, as, occupying, free, particle, momentum, states, exotic, examples, of, degenerate, matter, include, neutron, degenerate, matter, strange, matter, metallic, hydrogen, and, white, dwarf, matter, degenerate, gases, are, gases, composed, of, fermions, such, as, electrons, protons, and, neutrons, rather, than, molecules, of, ordinary, matter, the, electron, gas, in, ordinary, metals, and, in, the, interior, of, white, dwarfs, are, two, examples, following, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, there, can, be, only, one, fermion, occupying, each, quantum, state, in, a, degenerate, gas, all, quantum, states, are, filled, up, to, the, fermi, energy, most, stars, are, supported, against, their, own, gravitation, by, normal, thermal, gas, pressure, while, in, white, dwarf, stars, the, supporting, force, comes, from, the, degeneracy, pressure, of, the, electron, gas, in, their, interior, in, neutron, stars, the, degenerate, particles, are, neutrons, a, fermion, gas, in, which, all, quantum, states, below, a, given, energy, level, are, filled, is, called, a, fully, degenerate, fermion, gas, the, difference, between, this, energy, level, and, the, lowest, energy, level, is, known, as, the, fermi, energy, in, an, ordinary, fermion, gas, in, which, thermal, effects, dominate, most, of, the, available, electron, energy, levels, are, unfilled, and, the, electrons, are, free, to, move, to, these, states, as, particle, density, is, increased, electrons, progressively, fill, the, lower, energy, states, and, additional, electrons, are, forced, to, occupy, states, of, higher, energy, even, at, low, temperatures, degenerate, gases, strongly, resist, further, compression, because, the, electrons, cannot, move, to, already, filled, lower, energy, levels, due, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, since, electrons, cannot, give, up, energy, by, moving, to, lower, energy, states, no, thermal, energy, can, be, extracted, the, momentum, of, the, fermions, in, the, fermion, gas, nevertheless, generates, pressure, termed, degeneracy, pressure, under, high, densities, matter, becomes, a, degenerate, gas, when, all, electrons, are, stripped, from, their, parent, atoms, the, core, of, a, star, once, hydrogen, burning, nuclear, fusion, reactions, stops, becomes, a, collection, of, positively, charged, ions, largely, helium, and, carbon, nuclei, floating, in, a, sea, of, electrons, which, have, been, stripped, from, the, nuclei, degenerate, gas, is, an, almost, perfect, conductor, of, heat, and, does, not, obey, ordinary, gas, laws, white, dwarfs, are, luminous, not, because, they, are, generating, energy, but, rather, because, they, have, trapped, a, large, amount, of, heat, which, is, gradually, radiated, away, normal, gas, exerts, higher, pressure, when, it, is, heated, and, expands, but, the, pressure, in, a, degenerate, gas, does, not, depend, on, the, temperature, when, gas, becomes, super, compressed, particles, position, right, up, against, each, other, to, produce, degenerate, gas, that, behaves, more, like, a, solid, in, degenerate, gases, the, kinetic, energies, of, electrons, are, quite, high, and, the, rate, of, collision, between, electrons, and, other, particles, is, quite, low, therefore, degenerate, electrons, can, travel, great, distances, at, velocities, that, approach, the, speed, of, light, instead, of, temperature, the, pressure, in, a, degenerate, gas, depends, only, on, the, speed, of, the, degenerate, particles, however, adding, heat, does, not, increase, the, speed, of, most, of, the, electrons, because, they, are, stuck, in, fully, occupied, quantum, states, pressure, is, increased, only, by, the, mass, of, the, particles, which, increases, the, gravitational, force, pulling, the, particles, closer, together, therefore, the, phenomenon, is, the, opposite, of, that, normally, found, in, matter, where, if, the, mass, of, the, matter, is, increased, the, object, becomes, bigger, in, degenerate, gas, when, the, mass, is, increased, the, particles, become, spaced, closer, together, due, to, gravity, and, the, pressure, is, increased, so, the, object, becomes, smaller, degenerate, gas, can, be, compressed, to, very, high, densities, typical, values, being, in, the, range, of, 10, 000, kilograms, per, cubic, centimeter, there, is, an, upper, limit, to, the, mass, of, an, electron, degenerate, object, the, chandrasekhar, limit, beyond, which, electron, degeneracy, pressure, cannot, support, the, object, against, collapse, the, limit, is, approximately, 1, 44, solar, masses, for, objects, with, typical, compositions, expected, for, white, dwarf, stars, carbon, and, oxygen, with, two, baryons, per, electron, this, mass, cut, off, is, appropriate, only, for, a, star, supported, by, ideal, electron, degeneracy, pressure, under, newtonian, gravity, in, general, relativity, and, with, realistic, coulomb, corrections, the, corresponding, mass, limit, is, around, 1, 38, solar, masses, the, limit, may, also, change, with, the, chemical, composition, of, the, object, as, it, affects, the, ratio, of, mass, to, number, of, electrons, present, the, object, s, rotation, which, counteracts, the, gravitational, force, also, changes, the, limit, for, any, particular, object, celestial, objects, below, this, limit, are, white, dwarf, stars, formed, by, the, gradual, shrinking, of, the, cores, of, stars, that, run, out, of, fuel, during, this, shrinking, an, electron, degenerate, gas, forms, in, the, core, providing, sufficient, degeneracy, pressure, as, it, is, compressed, to, resist, further, collapse, above, this, mass, limit, a, neutron, star, primarily, supported, by, neutron, degeneracy, pressure, or, a, black, hole, may, be, formed, instead, neutron, degeneracy, is, analogous, to, electron, degeneracy, and, exists, in, neutron, stars, which, are, partially, supported, by, the, pressure, from, a, degenerate, neutron, gas, neutron, stars, are, formed, either, directly, from, the, supernova, of, stars, with, masses, between, 10, and, 25, m, solar, masses, or, by, white, dwarfs, acquiring, a, mass, in, excess, of, the, chandrasekhar, limit, of, 1, 44, m, usually, either, as, a, result, of, a, merger, or, by, feeding, off, of, a, close, binary, partner, above, the, chandrasekhar, limit, the, gravitational, pressure, at, the, core, exceeds, the, electron, degeneracy, pressure, and, electrons, begin, to, combine, with, protons, to, produce, neutrons, via, inverse, beta, decay, also, termed, electron, capture, the, result, is, an, extremely, compact, star, composed, of, nuclear, matter, which, is, predominantly, a, degenerate, neutron, gas, with, a, small, admixture, of, degenerate, proton, and, electron, gases, neutrons, in, a, degenerate, neutron, gas, are, spaced, much, more, closely, than, electrons, in, an, electron, degenerate, gas, because, the, more, massive, neutron, has, a, much, shorter, wavelength, at, a, given, energy, this, phenomenon, is, compounded, by, the, fact, that, the, pressures, within, neutron, stars, are, much, higher, than, those, in, white, dwarfs, the, pressure, increase, is, caused, by, the, fact, that, the, compactness, of, a, neutron, star, causes, gravitational, forces, to, be, much, higher, than, in, a, less, compact, body, with, similar, mass, the, result, is, a, star, with, a, diameter, on, the, order, of, a, thousandth, that, of, a, white, dwarf, the, properties, of, neutron, matter, set, an, upper, limit, to, the, mass, of, a, neutron, star, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, which, is, analogous, to, the, chandrasekhar, limit, for, white, dwarf, stars, sufficiently, dense, matter, containing, protons, experiences, proton, degeneracy, pressure, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, electron, degeneracy, pressure, in, electron, degenerate, matter, protons, confined, to, a, sufficiently, small, volume, have, a, large, uncertainty, in, their, momentum, due, to, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, however, because, protons, are, much, more, massive, than, electrons, the, same, momentum, represents, a, much, smaller, velocity, for, protons, than, for, electrons, as, a, result, in, matter, with, approximately, equal, numbers, of, protons, and, electrons, proton, degeneracy, pressure, is, much, smaller, than, electron, degeneracy, pressure, and, proton, degeneracy, is, usually, modelled, as, a, correction, to, the, equations, of, state, of, electron, degenerate, matter, at, densities, greater, than, those, supported, by, neutron, degeneracy, quark, matter, is, expected, to, occur, several, variations, of, this, hypothesis, have, been, proposed, that, represent, quark, degenerate, states, strange, matter, is, a, degenerate, gas, of, quarks, that, is, often, assumed, to, contain, strange, quarks, in, addition, to, the, usual, up, and, down, quarks, color, superconductor, materials, are, degenerate, gases, of, quarks, in, which, quarks, pair, up, in, a, manner, similar, to, cooper, pairing, in, electrical, superconductors, the, equations, of, state, for, the, various, proposed, forms, of, quark, degenerate, matter, vary, widely, and, are, usually, also, poorly, defined, due, to, the, difficulty, of, modelling, strong, force, interactions, quark, degenerate, matter, may, occur, in, the, cores, of, neutron, stars, depending, on, the, equations, of, state, of, neutron, degenerate, matter, it, may, also, occur, in, hypothetical, quark, stars, formed, by, the, collapse, of, objects, above, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, mass, limit, for, neutron, degenerate, objects, whether, quark, degenerate, matter, forms, at, all, in, these, situations, depends, on, the, equations, of, state, of, both, neutron, degenerate, matter, and, quark, degenerate, matter, both, of, which, are, poorly, known, quark, stars, are, considered, to, be, an, intermediate, category, between, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, quantum, mechanics, uses, the, word, degenerate, in, two, ways, degenerate, energy, levels, and, as, the, low, temperature, ground, state, limit, for, states, of, matter, 437, the, electron, degeneracy, pressure, occurs, in, the, ground, state, systems, which, are, non, degenerate, in, energy, levels, the, term, degeneracy, derives, from, work, on, the, specific, heat, of, gases, that, pre, dates, the, use, of, the, term, in, quantum, mechanics, in, 1914, walther, nernst, described, the, reduction, of, the, specific, heat, of, gases, at, very, low, temperature, as, degeneration, he, attributed, this, to, quantum, effects, in, subsequent, work, in, various, papers, on, quantum, thermodynamics, by, albert, einstein, by, max, planck, and, by, erwin, schr, dinger, the, effect, at, low, temperatures, came, to, be, called, gas, degeneracy, a, fully, degenerate, gas, has, no, volume, dependence, on, pressure, when, temperature, approaches, absolute, zero, early, in, 1927, enrico, fermi, and, separately, llewellyn, thomas, developed, a, semi, classical, model, for, electrons, in, a, metal, the, model, treated, the, electrons, as, a, gas, later, in, 1927, arnold, sommerfeld, applied, the, pauli, principle, via, fermi, dirac, statistics, to, this, electron, gas, model, computing, the, specific, heat, of, metals, the, result, became, fermi, gas, model, for, metals, sommerfeld, called, the, low, temperature, region, with, quantum, effects, a, wholly, degenerate, gas, also, in, 1927, ralph, h, fowler, applied, fermi, s, model, to, the, puzzle, of, the, stability, of, white, dwarf, stars, this, approach, was, extended, to, relativistic, models, by, later, studies, and, with, the, work, of, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, became, the, accepted, model, for, star, stability
