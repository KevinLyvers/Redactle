in, chemistry, an, ester, is, a, functional, group, derived, from, an, acid, organic, or, inorganic, in, which, the, hydrogen, atom, h, of, at, least, one, acidic, hydroxyl, group, oh, of, that, acid, is, replaced, by, an, organyl, group, r, analogues, derived, from, oxygen, replaced, by, other, chalcogens, belong, to, the, ester, category, as, well, according, to, some, authors, organyl, derivatives, of, acidic, hydrogen, of, other, acids, are, esters, as, well, e, g, amides, but, not, according, to, the, iupac, glycerides, are, fatty, acid, esters, of, glycerol, they, are, important, in, biology, being, one, of, the, main, classes, of, lipids, and, comprising, the, bulk, of, animal, fats, and, vegetable, oils, lactones, are, cyclic, carboxylic, esters, naturally, occurring, lactones, are, mainly, 5, and, 6, membered, ring, lactones, lactones, contribute, to, the, aroma, of, fruits, butter, cheese, vegetables, like, celery, and, other, foods, esters, can, be, formed, from, oxoacids, e, g, esters, of, acetic, acid, carbonic, acid, sulfuric, acid, phosphoric, acid, nitric, acid, xanthic, acid, but, also, from, acids, that, do, not, contain, oxygen, e, g, esters, of, thiocyanic, acid, and, trithiocarbonic, acid, an, example, of, an, ester, formation, is, the, substitution, reaction, between, a, carboxylic, acid, r, c, o, oh, and, an, alcohol, r, oh, forming, an, ester, r, c, o, o, r, where, r, stands, for, any, group, typically, hydrogen, or, organyl, and, r, stands, for, organyl, group, organyl, esters, of, carboxylic, acids, typically, have, a, pleasant, smell, those, of, low, molecular, weight, are, commonly, used, as, fragrances, and, are, found, in, essential, oils, and, pheromones, they, perform, as, high, grade, solvents, for, a, broad, array, of, plastics, plasticizers, resins, and, lacquers, and, are, one, of, the, largest, classes, of, synthetic, lubricants, on, the, commercial, market, polyesters, are, important, plastics, with, monomers, linked, by, ester, moieties, esters, of, phosphoric, acid, form, the, backbone, of, dna, molecules, esters, of, nitric, acid, such, as, nitroglycerin, are, known, for, their, explosive, properties, there, are, compounds, in, which, an, acidic, hydrogen, of, acids, mentioned, in, this, article, are, not, replaced, by, an, organyl, but, by, some, other, group, according, to, some, authors, those, compounds, are, esters, as, well, especially, when, the, first, carbon, atom, of, the, organyl, group, replacing, acidic, hydrogen, is, replaced, by, another, atom, from, the, group, 14, elements, si, ge, sn, pb, for, example, according, to, them, trimethylstannyl, acetate, or, trimethyltin, acetate, ch, 3, coosn, ch, 3, 3, is, a, trimethylstannyl, ester, of, acetic, acid, and, dibutyltin, dilaurate, ch, 3, ch, 2, 10, coo, 2, sn, ch, 2, 3, ch, 3, 2, is, a, dibutylstannylene, ester, of, lauric, acid, and, the, phillips, catalyst, cro, 2, osi, och, 3, 3, 2, is, a, trimethoxysilyl, ester, of, chromic, acid, h, 2, cro, 4, the, word, ester, was, coined, in, 1848, by, a, german, chemist, leopold, gmelin, probably, as, a, contraction, of, the, german, essig, ther, acetic, ether, the, names, of, esters, that, are, formed, from, an, alcohol, and, an, acid, are, derived, from, the, parent, alcohol, and, the, parent, acid, where, the, latter, may, be, organic, or, inorganic, esters, derived, from, the, simplest, carboxylic, acids, are, commonly, named, according, to, the, more, traditional, so, called, trivial, names, e, g, as, formate, acetate, propionate, and, butyrate, as, opposed, to, the, iupac, nomenclature, methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate, and, butanoate, esters, derived, from, more, complex, carboxylic, acids, are, on, the, other, hand, more, frequently, named, using, the, systematic, iupac, name, based, on, the, name, for, the, acid, followed, by, the, suffix, oate, for, example, the, ester, hexyl, octanoate, also, known, under, the, trivial, name, hexyl, caprylate, has, the, formula, ch, 3, ch, 2, 6, co, 2, ch, 2, 5, ch, 3, the, chemical, formulas, of, organic, esters, formed, from, carboxylic, acids, and, alcohols, usually, take, the, form, rco, 2, r, or, rcoor, where, r, and, r, are, the, organyl, parts, of, the, carboxylic, acid, and, the, alcohol, respectively, and, r, can, be, a, hydrogen, in, the, case, of, esters, of, formic, acid, for, example, butyl, acetate, systematically, butyl, ethanoate, derived, from, butanol, and, acetic, acid, systematically, ethanoic, acid, would, be, written, ch, 3, co, 2, ch, 2, 3, ch, 3, alternative, presentations, are, common, including, buoac, and, ch, 3, coo, ch, 2, 3, ch, 3, cyclic, esters, are, called, lactones, regardless, of, whether, they, are, derived, from, an, organic, or, inorganic, acid, one, example, of, an, organic, lactone, is, valerolactone, an, uncommon, class, of, esters, are, the, orthoesters, one, of, them, are, the, esters, of, orthocarboxylic, acids, those, esters, have, the, formula, rc, or, 3, where, r, stands, for, any, group, organic, or, inorganic, and, r, stands, for, organyl, group, for, example, triethyl, orthoformate, hc, och, 2, ch, 3, 3, is, derived, in, terms, of, its, name, but, not, its, synthesis, from, esterification, of, orthoformic, acid, hc, oh, 3, with, ethanol, esters, can, also, be, derived, from, inorganic, acids, inorganic, acids, that, exist, as, tautomers, form, two, or, more, types, of, esters, some, inorganic, acids, that, are, unstable, or, elusive, form, stable, esters, in, principle, a, part, of, metal, and, metalloid, alkoxides, of, which, many, hundreds, are, known, could, be, classified, as, esters, of, the, corresponding, acids, e, g, aluminium, triethoxide, al, och, 2, ch, 3, 3, could, be, classified, as, an, ester, of, aluminic, acid, which, is, aluminium, hydroxide, tetraethyl, orthosilicate, si, och, 2, ch, 3, 4, could, be, classified, as, an, ester, of, orthosilicic, acid, and, titanium, ethoxide, ti, och, 2, ch, 3, 4, could, be, classified, as, an, ester, of, orthotitanic, acid, esters, derived, from, carboxylic, acids, and, alcohols, contain, a, carbonyl, group, c, o, which, is, a, divalent, group, at, c, atom, which, gives, rise, to, 120, c, c, o, and, o, c, o, angles, unlike, amides, carboxylic, acid, esters, are, structurally, flexible, functional, groups, because, rotation, about, the, c, o, c, bonds, has, a, low, barrier, their, flexibility, and, low, polarity, is, manifested, in, their, physical, properties, they, tend, to, be, less, rigid, lower, melting, point, and, more, volatile, lower, boiling, point, than, the, corresponding, amides, the, p, k, a, of, the, alpha, hydrogens, on, esters, of, carboxylic, acids, is, around, 25, alpha, hydrogen, is, a, hydrogen, bound, to, the, carbon, adjacent, to, the, carbonyl, group, c, o, of, carboxylate, esters, many, carboxylic, acid, esters, have, the, potential, for, conformational, isomerism, but, they, tend, to, adopt, an, s, cis, or, z, conformation, rather, than, the, s, trans, or, e, alternative, due, to, a, combination, of, hyperconjugation, and, dipole, minimization, effects, the, preference, for, the, z, conformation, is, influenced, by, the, nature, of, the, substituents, and, solvent, if, present, lactones, with, small, rings, are, restricted, to, the, s, trans, i, e, e, conformation, due, to, their, cyclic, structure, esters, derived, from, carboxylic, acids, and, alcohols, are, more, polar, than, ethers, but, less, polar, than, alcohols, they, participate, in, hydrogen, bonds, as, hydrogen, bond, acceptors, but, cannot, act, as, hydrogen, bond, donors, unlike, their, parent, alcohols, this, ability, to, participate, in, hydrogen, bonding, confers, some, water, solubility, because, of, their, lack, of, hydrogen, bond, donating, ability, esters, do, not, self, associate, consequently, esters, are, more, volatile, than, carboxylic, acids, of, similar, molecular, weight, esters, are, generally, identified, by, gas, chromatography, taking, advantage, of, their, volatility, ir, spectra, for, esters, feature, an, intense, sharp, band, in, the, range, 1730, 1750, cm, 1, assigned, to, c, o, this, peak, changes, depending, on, the, functional, groups, attached, to, the, carbonyl, for, example, a, benzene, ring, or, double, bond, in, conjunction, with, the, carbonyl, will, bring, the, wavenumber, down, about, 30, cm, 1, esters, are, widespread, in, nature, and, are, widely, used, in, industry, in, nature, fats, are, in, general, triesters, derived, from, glycerol, and, fatty, acids, esters, are, responsible, for, the, aroma, of, many, fruits, including, apples, durians, pears, bananas, pineapples, and, strawberries, several, billion, kilograms, of, polyesters, are, produced, industrially, annually, important, products, being, polyethylene, terephthalate, acrylate, esters, and, cellulose, acetate, esterification, is, the, general, name, for, a, chemical, reaction, in, which, two, reactants, typically, an, alcohol, and, an, acid, form, an, ester, as, the, reaction, product, esters, are, common, in, organic, chemistry, and, biological, materials, and, often, have, a, pleasant, characteristic, fruity, odor, this, leads, to, their, extensive, use, in, the, fragrance, and, flavor, industry, ester, bonds, are, also, found, in, many, polymers, the, classic, synthesis, is, the, fischer, esterification, which, involves, treating, a, carboxylic, acid, with, an, alcohol, in, the, presence, of, a, dehydrating, agent, the, equilibrium, constant, for, such, reactions, is, about, 5, for, typical, esters, e, g, ethyl, acetate, the, reaction, is, slow, in, the, absence, of, a, catalyst, sulfuric, acid, is, a, typical, catalyst, for, this, reaction, many, other, acids, are, also, used, such, as, polymeric, sulfonic, acids, since, esterification, is, highly, reversible, the, yield, of, the, ester, can, be, improved, using, le, chatelier, s, principle, reagents, are, known, that, drive, the, dehydration, of, mixtures, of, alcohols, and, carboxylic, acids, one, example, is, the, steglich, esterification, which, is, a, method, of, forming, esters, under, mild, conditions, the, method, is, popular, in, peptide, synthesis, where, the, substrates, are, sensitive, to, harsh, conditions, like, high, heat, dcc, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, is, used, to, activate, the, carboxylic, acid, to, further, reaction, 4, dimethylaminopyridine, dmap, is, used, as, an, acyl, transfer, catalyst, another, method, for, the, dehydration, of, mixtures, of, alcohols, and, carboxylic, acids, is, the, mitsunobu, reaction, carboxylic, acids, can, be, esterified, using, diazomethane, using, this, diazomethane, mixtures, of, carboxylic, acids, can, be, converted, to, their, methyl, esters, in, near, quantitative, yields, e, g, for, analysis, by, gas, chromatography, the, method, is, useful, in, specialized, organic, synthetic, operations, but, is, considered, too, hazardous, and, expensive, for, large, scale, applications, carboxylic, acids, are, esterified, by, treatment, with, epoxides, giving, hydroxyesters, this, reaction, is, employed, in, the, production, of, vinyl, ester, resin, from, acrylic, acid, alcohols, react, with, acyl, chlorides, and, acid, anhydrides, to, give, esters, the, reactions, are, irreversible, simplifying, work, up, since, acyl, chlorides, and, acid, anhydrides, also, react, with, water, anhydrous, conditions, are, preferred, the, analogous, acylations, of, amines, to, give, amides, are, less, sensitive, because, amines, are, stronger, nucleophiles, and, react, more, rapidly, than, does, water, this, method, is, employed, only, for, laboratory, scale, procedures, as, it, is, expensive, trimethyloxonium, tetrafluoroborate, can, be, used, for, esterification, of, carboxylic, acids, under, conditions, where, acid, catalyzed, reactions, are, infeasible, although, rarely, employed, for, esterifications, carboxylate, salts, often, generated, in, situ, react, with, electrophilic, alkylating, agents, such, as, alkyl, halides, to, give, esters, anion, availability, can, inhibit, this, reaction, which, correspondingly, benefits, from, phase, transfer, catalysts, or, such, highly, polar, aprotic, solvents, as, dmf, an, additional, iodide, salt, may, via, the, finkelstein, reaction, catalyze, the, reaction, of, a, recalcitrant, alkyl, halide, alternatively, salts, of, a, coordinating, metal, such, as, silver, may, improve, the, reaction, rate, by, easing, halide, elimination, transesterification, which, involves, changing, one, ester, into, another, one, is, widely, practiced, like, the, hydrolysation, transesterification, is, catalysed, by, acids, and, bases, the, reaction, is, widely, used, for, degrading, triglycerides, e, g, in, the, production, of, fatty, acid, esters, and, alcohols, poly, ethylene, terephthalate, is, produced, by, the, transesterification, of, dimethyl, terephthalate, and, ethylene, glycol, a, subset, of, transesterification, is, the, alcoholysis, of, diketene, this, reaction, affords, 2, ketoesters, alkenes, undergo, carboalkoxylation, in, the, presence, of, metal, carbonyl, catalysts, esters, of, propanoic, acid, are, produced, commercially, by, this, method, a, preparation, of, methyl, propionate, is, one, illustrative, example, the, carbonylation, of, methanol, yields, methyl, formate, which, is, the, main, commercial, source, of, formic, acid, the, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, sodium, methoxide, in, hydroesterification, alkenes, and, alkynes, insert, into, the, o, h, bond, of, carboxylic, acids, vinyl, acetate, is, produced, industrially, by, the, addition, of, acetic, acid, to, acetylene, in, the, presence, of, zinc, acetate, catalysts, vinyl, acetate, can, also, be, produced, by, palladium, catalyzed, reaction, of, ethylene, acetic, acid, and, oxygen, silicotungstic, acid, is, used, to, manufacture, ethyl, acetate, by, the, alkylation, of, acetic, acid, by, ethylene, the, tishchenko, reaction, involves, disproportionation, of, an, aldehyde, in, the, presence, of, an, anhydrous, base, to, give, an, ester, catalysts, are, aluminium, alkoxides, or, sodium, alkoxides, benzaldehyde, reacts, with, sodium, benzyloxide, generated, from, sodium, and, benzyl, alcohol, to, generate, benzyl, benzoate, the, method, is, used, in, the, production, of, ethyl, acetate, from, acetaldehyde, esters, are, less, reactive, than, acid, halides, and, anhydrides, as, with, more, reactive, acyl, derivatives, they, can, react, with, ammonia, and, primary, and, secondary, amines, to, give, amides, although, this, type, of, reaction, is, not, often, used, since, acid, halides, give, better, yields, esters, can, be, converted, to, other, esters, in, a, process, known, as, transesterification, transesterification, can, be, either, acid, or, base, catalyzed, and, involves, the, reaction, of, an, ester, with, an, alcohol, unfortunately, because, the, leaving, group, is, also, an, alcohol, the, forward, and, reverse, reactions, will, often, occur, at, similar, rates, using, a, large, excess, of, the, reactant, alcohol, or, removing, the, leaving, group, alcohol, e, g, via, distillation, will, drive, the, forward, reaction, towards, completion, in, accordance, with, le, chatelier, s, principle, acid, catalyzed, hydrolysis, of, esters, is, also, an, equilibrium, process, essentially, the, reverse, of, the, fischer, esterification, reaction, because, an, alcohol, which, acts, as, the, leaving, group, and, water, which, acts, as, the, nucleophile, have, similar, p, k, a, values, the, forward, and, reverse, reactions, compete, with, each, other, as, in, transesterification, using, a, large, excess, of, reactant, water, or, removing, one, of, the, products, the, alcohol, can, promote, the, forward, reaction, basic, hydrolysis, of, esters, known, as, saponification, is, not, an, equilibrium, process, a, full, equivalent, of, base, is, consumed, in, the, reaction, which, produces, one, equivalent, of, alcohol, and, one, equivalent, of, a, carboxylate, salt, the, saponification, of, esters, of, fatty, acids, is, an, industrially, important, process, used, in, the, production, of, soap, esterification, is, a, reversible, reaction, esters, undergo, hydrolysis, under, acidic, and, basic, conditions, under, acidic, conditions, the, reaction, is, the, reverse, reaction, of, the, fischer, esterification, under, basic, conditions, hydroxide, acts, as, a, nucleophile, while, an, alkoxide, is, the, leaving, group, this, reaction, saponification, is, the, basis, of, soap, making, the, alkoxide, group, may, also, be, displaced, by, stronger, nucleophiles, such, as, ammonia, or, primary, or, secondary, amines, to, give, amides, ammonolysis, reaction, this, reaction, is, not, usually, reversible, hydrazines, and, hydroxylamine, can, be, used, in, place, of, amines, esters, can, be, converted, to, isocyanates, through, intermediate, hydroxamic, acids, in, the, lossen, rearrangement, sources, of, carbon, nucleophiles, e, g, grignard, reagents, and, organolithium, compounds, add, readily, to, the, carbonyl, compared, to, ketones, and, aldehydes, esters, are, relatively, resistant, to, reduction, the, introduction, of, catalytic, hydrogenation, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, was, a, breakthrough, esters, of, fatty, acids, are, hydrogenated, to, fatty, alcohols, a, typical, catalyst, is, copper, chromite, prior, to, the, development, of, catalytic, hydrogenation, esters, were, reduced, on, a, large, scale, using, the, bouveault, blanc, reduction, this, method, which, is, largely, obsolete, uses, sodium, in, the, presence, of, proton, sources, especially, for, fine, chemical, syntheses, lithium, aluminium, hydride, is, used, to, reduce, esters, to, two, primary, alcohols, the, related, reagent, sodium, borohydride, is, slow, in, this, reaction, dibah, reduces, esters, to, aldehydes, direct, reduction, to, give, the, corresponding, ether, is, difficult, as, the, intermediate, hemiacetal, tends, to, decompose, to, give, an, alcohol, and, an, aldehyde, which, is, rapidly, reduced, to, give, a, second, alcohol, the, reaction, can, be, achieved, using, triethylsilane, with, a, variety, of, lewis, acids, esters, can, undergo, a, variety, of, reactions, with, carbon, nucleophiles, they, react, with, an, excess, of, a, grignard, reagent, to, give, tertiary, alcohols, esters, also, react, readily, with, enolates, in, the, claisen, condensation, an, enolate, of, one, ester, 1, will, attack, the, carbonyl, group, of, another, ester, 2, to, give, tetrahedral, intermediate, 3, the, intermediate, collapses, forcing, out, an, alkoxide, r, o, and, producing, keto, ester, 4, crossed, claisen, condensations, in, which, the, enolate, and, nucleophile, are, different, esters, are, also, possible, an, intramolecular, claisen, condensation, is, called, a, dieckmann, condensation, or, dieckmann, cyclization, since, it, can, be, used, to, form, rings, esters, can, also, undergo, condensations, with, ketone, and, aldehyde, enolates, to, give, dicarbonyl, compounds, a, specific, example, of, this, is, the, baker, venkataraman, rearrangement, in, which, an, aromatic, ortho, acyloxy, ketone, undergoes, an, intramolecular, nucleophilic, acyl, substitution, and, subsequent, rearrangement, to, form, an, aromatic, diketone, the, chan, rearrangement, is, another, example, of, a, rearrangement, resulting, from, an, intramolecular, nucleophilic, acyl, substitution, reaction, esters, react, with, nucleophiles, at, the, carbonyl, carbon, the, carbonyl, is, weakly, electrophilic, but, is, attacked, by, strong, nucleophiles, amines, alkoxides, hydride, sources, organolithium, compounds, etc, the, c, h, bonds, adjacent, to, the, carbonyl, are, weakly, acidic, but, undergo, deprotonation, with, strong, bases, this, process, is, the, one, that, usually, initiates, condensation, reactions, the, carbonyl, oxygen, in, esters, is, weakly, basic, less, so, than, the, carbonyl, oxygen, in, amides, due, to, resonance, donation, of, an, electron, pair, from, nitrogen, in, amides, but, forms, adducts, as, for, aldehydes, the, hydrogen, atoms, on, the, carbon, adjacent, to, the, carboxyl, group, in, esters, are, sufficiently, acidic, to, undergo, deprotonation, which, in, turn, leads, to, a, variety, of, useful, reactions, deprotonation, requires, relatively, strong, bases, such, as, alkoxides, deprotonation, gives, a, nucleophilic, enolate, which, can, further, react, e, g, the, claisen, condensation, and, its, intramolecular, equivalent, the, dieckmann, condensation, this, conversion, is, exploited, in, the, malonic, ester, synthesis, wherein, the, diester, of, malonic, acid, reacts, with, an, electrophile, e, g, alkyl, halide, and, is, subsequently, decarboxylated, another, variation, is, the, fr, ter, seebach, alkylation, as, a, class, esters, serve, as, protecting, groups, for, carboxylic, acids, protecting, a, carboxylic, acid, is, useful, in, peptide, synthesis, to, prevent, self, reactions, of, the, bifunctional, amino, acids, methyl, and, ethyl, esters, are, commonly, available, for, many, amino, acids, the, t, butyl, ester, tends, to, be, more, expensive, however, t, butyl, esters, are, particularly, useful, because, under, strongly, acidic, conditions, the, t, butyl, esters, undergo, elimination, to, give, the, carboxylic, acid, and, isobutylene, simplifying, work, up, many, esters, have, distinctive, fruit, like, odors, and, many, occur, naturally, in, the, essential, oils, of, plants, this, has, also, led, to, their, common, use, in, artificial, flavorings, and, fragrances, which, aim, to, mimic, those, odors, b, ester, oder, sauerstoffs, ure, aetherarten, ethers, du, troisi, me, genre, viele, mineralische, und,
