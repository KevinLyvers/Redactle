a, black, hole, is, a, region, of, spacetime, where, gravity, is, so, strong, that, nothing, not, even, light, and, other, electromagnetic, waves, is, capable, of, possessing, enough, energy, to, escape, it, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, predicts, that, a, sufficiently, compact, mass, can, deform, spacetime, to, form, a, black, hole, the, boundary, of, no, escape, is, called, the, event, horizon, a, black, hole, has, a, great, effect, on, the, fate, and, circumstances, of, an, object, crossing, it, but, it, has, no, locally, detectable, features, according, to, general, relativity, in, many, ways, a, black, hole, acts, like, an, ideal, black, body, as, it, reflects, no, light, quantum, field, theory, in, curved, spacetime, predicts, that, event, horizons, emit, hawking, radiation, with, the, same, spectrum, as, a, black, body, of, a, temperature, inversely, proportional, to, its, mass, this, temperature, is, of, the, order, of, billionths, of, a, kelvin, for, stellar, black, holes, making, it, essentially, impossible, to, observe, directly, objects, whose, gravitational, fields, are, too, strong, for, light, to, escape, were, first, considered, in, the, 18th, century, by, john, michell, and, pierre, simon, laplace, in, 1916, karl, schwarzschild, found, the, first, modern, solution, of, general, relativity, that, would, characterise, a, black, hole, david, finkelstein, in, 1958, first, published, the, interpretation, of, black, hole, as, a, region, of, space, from, which, nothing, can, escape, black, holes, were, long, considered, a, mathematical, curiosity, it, was, not, until, the, 1960s, that, theoretical, work, showed, they, were, a, generic, prediction, of, general, relativity, the, discovery, of, neutron, stars, by, jocelyn, bell, burnell, in, 1967, sparked, interest, in, gravitationally, collapsed, compact, objects, as, a, possible, astrophysical, reality, the, first, black, hole, known, was, cygnus, x, 1, identified, by, several, researchers, independently, in, 1971, black, holes, of, stellar, mass, form, when, massive, stars, collapse, at, the, end, of, their, life, cycle, after, a, black, hole, has, formed, it, can, grow, by, absorbing, mass, from, its, surroundings, supermassive, black, holes, of, millions, of, solar, masses, m, may, form, by, absorbing, other, stars, and, merging, with, other, black, holes, or, via, direct, collapse, of, gas, clouds, there, is, consensus, that, supermassive, black, holes, exist, in, the, centres, of, most, galaxies, the, presence, of, a, black, hole, can, be, inferred, through, its, interaction, with, other, matter, and, with, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, visible, light, any, matter, that, falls, toward, a, black, hole, can, form, an, external, accretion, disk, heated, by, friction, forming, quasars, some, of, the, brightest, objects, in, the, universe, stars, passing, too, close, to, a, supermassive, black, hole, can, be, shredded, into, streamers, that, shine, very, brightly, before, being, swallowed, if, other, stars, are, orbiting, a, black, hole, their, orbits, can, be, used, to, determine, the, black, hole, s, mass, and, location, such, observations, can, be, used, to, exclude, possible, alternatives, such, as, neutron, stars, in, this, way, astronomers, have, identified, numerous, stellar, black, hole, candidates, in, binary, systems, and, established, that, the, radio, source, known, as, sagittarius, a, at, the, core, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, of, about, 4, 3, million, solar, masses, the, idea, of, a, body, so, big, that, even, light, could, not, escape, was, briefly, proposed, by, english, astronomical, pioneer, and, clergyman, john, michell, in, a, letter, published, in, november, 1784, michell, s, simplistic, calculations, assumed, such, a, body, might, have, the, same, density, as, the, sun, and, concluded, that, one, would, form, when, a, star, s, diameter, exceeds, the, sun, s, by, a, factor, of, 500, and, its, surface, escape, velocity, exceeds, the, usual, speed, of, light, michell, correctly, noted, that, such, supermassive, but, non, radiating, bodies, might, be, detectable, through, their, gravitational, effects, on, nearby, visible, bodies, scholars, of, the, time, were, initially, excited, by, the, proposal, that, giant, but, invisible, dark, stars, might, be, hiding, in, plain, view, but, enthusiasm, dampened, when, the, wavelike, nature, of, light, became, apparent, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, as, if, light, were, a, wave, rather, than, a, particle, it, was, unclear, what, if, any, influence, gravity, would, have, on, escaping, light, waves, the, modern, theory, of, gravity, general, relativity, discredits, michell, s, notion, of, a, light, ray, shooting, directly, from, the, surface, of, a, supermassive, star, being, slowed, down, by, the, star, s, gravity, stopping, and, then, free, falling, back, to, the, star, s, surface, instead, spacetime, itself, is, curved, such, that, the, geodesic, that, light, travels, on, never, leaves, the, surface, of, the, star, black, hole, in, 1915, albert, einstein, developed, his, theory, of, general, relativity, having, earlier, shown, that, gravity, does, influence, light, s, motion, only, a, few, months, later, karl, schwarzschild, found, a, solution, to, the, einstein, field, equations, that, describes, the, gravitational, field, of, a, point, mass, and, a, spherical, mass, a, few, months, after, schwarzschild, johannes, droste, a, student, of, hendrik, lorentz, independently, gave, the, same, solution, for, the, point, mass, and, wrote, more, extensively, about, its, properties, this, solution, had, a, peculiar, behaviour, at, what, is, now, called, the, schwarzschild, radius, where, it, became, singular, meaning, that, some, of, the, terms, in, the, einstein, equations, became, infinite, the, nature, of, this, surface, was, not, quite, understood, at, the, time, in, 1924, arthur, eddington, showed, that, the, singularity, disappeared, after, a, change, of, coordinates, in, 1933, georges, lema, tre, realised, that, this, meant, the, singularity, at, the, schwarzschild, radius, was, a, non, physical, coordinate, singularity, arthur, eddington, commented, on, the, possibility, of, a, star, with, mass, compressed, to, the, schwarzschild, radius, in, a, 1926, book, noting, that, einstein, s, theory, allows, us, to, rule, out, overly, large, densities, for, visible, stars, like, betelgeuse, because, a, star, of, 250, million, km, radius, could, not, possibly, have, so, high, a, density, as, the, sun, firstly, the, force, of, gravitation, would, be, so, great, that, light, would, be, unable, to, escape, from, it, the, rays, falling, back, to, the, star, like, a, stone, to, the, earth, secondly, the, red, shift, of, the, spectral, lines, would, be, so, great, that, the, spectrum, would, be, shifted, out, of, existence, thirdly, the, mass, would, produce, so, much, curvature, of, the, spacetime, metric, that, space, would, close, up, around, the, star, leaving, us, outside, i, e, nowhere, in, 1931, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, calculated, using, special, relativity, that, a, non, rotating, body, of, electron, degenerate, matter, above, a, certain, limiting, mass, now, called, the, chandrasekhar, limit, at, 1, 4, m, has, no, stable, solutions, his, arguments, were, opposed, by, many, of, his, contemporaries, like, eddington, and, lev, landau, who, argued, that, some, yet, unknown, mechanism, would, stop, the, collapse, they, were, partly, correct, a, white, dwarf, slightly, more, massive, than, the, chandrasekhar, limit, will, collapse, into, a, neutron, star, which, is, itself, stable, in, 1939, robert, oppenheimer, and, others, predicted, that, neutron, stars, above, another, limit, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, would, collapse, further, for, the, reasons, presented, by, chandrasekhar, and, concluded, that, no, law, of, physics, was, likely, to, intervene, and, stop, at, least, some, stars, from, collapsing, to, black, holes, their, original, calculations, based, on, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, gave, it, as, 0, 7, m, subsequent, consideration, of, neutron, neutron, repulsion, mediated, by, the, strong, force, raised, the, estimate, to, approximately, 1, 5, m, to, 3, 0, m, observations, of, the, neutron, star, merger, gw170817, which, is, thought, to, have, generated, a, black, hole, shortly, afterward, have, refined, the, tov, limit, estimate, to, 2, 17, m, oppenheimer, and, his, co, authors, interpreted, the, singularity, at, the, boundary, of, the, schwarzschild, radius, as, indicating, that, this, was, the, boundary, of, a, bubble, in, which, time, stopped, this, is, a, valid, point, of, view, for, external, observers, but, not, for, infalling, observers, the, hypothetical, collapsed, stars, were, called, frozen, stars, because, an, outside, observer, would, see, the, surface, of, the, star, frozen, in, time, at, the, instant, where, its, collapse, takes, it, to, the, schwarzschild, radius, also, in, 1939, einstein, attempted, to, prove, that, black, holes, were, impossible, in, his, publication, on, a, stationary, system, with, spherical, symmetry, consisting, of, many, gravitating, masses, using, his, theory, of, general, relativity, to, defend, his, argument, months, later, oppenheimer, and, his, student, hartland, snyder, provided, the, oppenheimer, snyder, model, in, their, paper, on, continued, gravitational, contraction, which, predicted, the, existence, of, black, holes, in, the, paper, which, made, no, reference, to, einstein, s, recent, publication, oppenheimer, and, snyder, used, einstein, s, own, theory, of, general, relativity, to, show, the, conditions, on, how, a, black, hole, could, develop, for, the, first, time, in, contemporary, physics, in, 1958, david, finkelstein, identified, the, schwarzschild, surface, as, an, event, horizon, a, perfect, unidirectional, membrane, causal, influences, can, cross, it, in, only, one, direction, this, did, not, strictly, contradict, oppenheimer, s, results, but, extended, them, to, include, the, point, of, view, of, infalling, observers, finkelstein, s, solution, extended, the, schwarzschild, solution, for, the, future, of, observers, falling, into, a, black, hole, a, complete, extension, had, already, been, found, by, martin, kruskal, who, was, urged, to, publish, it, these, results, came, at, the, beginning, of, the, golden, age, of, general, relativity, which, was, marked, by, general, relativity, and, black, holes, becoming, mainstream, subjects, of, research, this, process, was, helped, by, the, discovery, of, pulsars, by, jocelyn, bell, burnell, in, 1967, which, by, 1969, were, shown, to, be, rapidly, rotating, neutron, stars, until, that, time, neutron, stars, like, black, holes, were, regarded, as, just, theoretical, curiosities, but, the, discovery, of, pulsars, showed, their, physical, relevance, and, spurred, a, further, interest, in, all, types, of, compact, objects, that, might, be, formed, by, gravitational, collapse, in, this, period, more, general, black, hole, solutions, were, found, in, 1963, roy, kerr, found, the, exact, solution, for, a, rotating, black, hole, two, years, later, ezra, newman, found, the, axisymmetric, solution, for, a, black, hole, that, is, both, rotating, and, electrically, charged, through, the, work, of, werner, israel, brandon, carter, and, david, robinson, the, no, hair, theorem, emerged, stating, that, a, stationary, black, hole, solution, is, completely, described, by, the, three, parameters, of, the, kerr, newman, metric, mass, angular, momentum, and, electric, charge, at, first, it, was, suspected, that, the, strange, features, of, the, black, hole, solutions, were, pathological, artefacts, from, the, symmetry, conditions, imposed, and, that, the, singularities, would, not, appear, in, generic, situations, this, view, was, held, in, particular, by, vladimir, belinsky, isaak, khalatnikov, and, evgeny, lifshitz, who, tried, to, prove, that, no, singularities, appear, in, generic, solutions, however, in, the, late, 1960s, roger, penrose, and, stephen, hawking, used, global, techniques, to, prove, that, singularities, appear, generically, for, this, work, penrose, received, half, of, the, 2020, nobel, prize, in, physics, hawking, having, died, in, 2018, based, on, observations, in, greenwich, and, toronto, in, the, early, 1970s, cygnus, x, 1, a, galactic, x, ray, source, discovered, in, 1964, became, the, first, astronomical, object, commonly, accepted, to, be, a, black, hole, work, by, james, bardeen, jacob, bekenstein, carter, and, hawking, in, the, early, 1970s, led, to, the, formulation, of, black, hole, thermodynamics, these, laws, describe, the, behaviour, of, a, black, hole, in, close, analogy, to, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, by, relating, mass, to, energy, area, to, entropy, and, surface, gravity, to, temperature, the, analogy, was, completed, when, hawking, in, 1974, showed, that, quantum, field, theory, implies, that, black, holes, should, radiate, like, a, black, body, with, a, temperature, proportional, to, the, surface, gravity, of, the, black, hole, predicting, the, effect, now, known, as, hawking, radiation, on, 11, february, 2016, the, ligo, scientific, collaboration, and, the, virgo, collaboration, announced, the, first, direct, detection, of, gravitational, waves, representing, the, first, observation, of, a, black, hole, merger, on, 10, april, 2019, the, first, direct, image, of, a, black, hole, and, its, vicinity, was, published, following, observations, made, by, the, event, horizon, telescope, eht, in, 2017, of, the, supermassive, black, hole, in, messier, 87, s, galactic, centre, as, of, 2023, the, nearest, known, body, thought, to, be, a, black, hole, gaia, bh1, is, around, 1, 560, light, years, 480, parsecs, away, though, only, a, couple, dozen, black, holes, have, been, found, so, far, in, the, milky, way, there, are, thought, to, be, hundreds, of, millions, most, of, which, are, solitary, and, do, not, cause, emission, of, radiation, therefore, they, would, only, be, detectable, by, gravitational, lensing, john, michell, used, the, term, dark, star, in, a, november, 1783, letter, to, henry, cavendish, and, in, the, early, 20th, century, physicists, used, the, term, gravitationally, collapsed, object, science, writer, marcia, bartusiak, traces, the, term, black, hole, to, physicist, robert, h, dicke, who, in, the, early, 1960s, reportedly, compared, the, phenomenon, to, the, black, hole, of, calcutta, notorious, as, a, prison, where, people, entered, but, never, left, alive, the, term, black, hole, was, used, in, print, by, life, and, science, news, magazines, in, 1963, and, by, science, journalist, ann, ewing, in, her, article, black, holes, in, space, dated, 18, january, 1964, which, was, a, report, on, a, meeting, of, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, held, in, cleveland, ohio, in, december, 1967, a, student, reportedly, suggested, the, phrase, black, hole, at, a, lecture, by, john, wheeler, wheeler, adopted, the, term, for, its, brevity, and, advertising, value, and, it, quickly, caught, on, leading, some, to, credit, wheeler, with, coining, the, phrase, the, no, hair, theorem, postulates, that, once, it, achieves, a, stable, condition, after, formation, a, black, hole, has, only, three, independent, physical, properties, mass, electric, charge, and, angular, momentum, the, black, hole, is, otherwise, featureless, if, the, conjecture, is, true, any, two, black, holes, that, share, the, same, values, for, these, properties, or, parameters, are, indistinguishable, from, one, another, the, degree, to, which, the, conjecture, is, true, for, real, black, holes, under, the, laws, of, modern, physics, is, currently, an, unsolved, problem, these, properties, are, special, because, they, are, visible, from, outside, a, black, hole, for, example, a, charged, black, hole, repels, other, like, charges, just, like, any, other, charged, object, similarly, the, total, mass, inside, a, sphere, containing, a, black, hole, can, be, found, by, using, the, gravitational, analogue, of, gauss, s, law, through, the, adm, mass, far, away, from, the, black, hole, likewise, the, angular, momentum, or, spin, can, be, measured, from, far, away, using, frame, dragging, by, the, gravitomagnetic, field, through, for, example, the, lense, thirring, effect, when, an, object, falls, into, a, black, hole, any, information, about, the, shape, of, the, object, or, distribution, of, charge, on, it, is, evenly, distributed, along, the, horizon, of, the, black, hole, and, is, lost, to, outside, observers, the, behaviour, of, the, horizon, in, this, situation, is, a, dissipative, system, that, is, closely, analogous, to, that, of, a, conductive, stretchy, membrane, with, friction, and, electrical, resistance, the, membrane, paradigm, this, is, different, from, other, field, theories, such, as, electromagnetism, which, do, not, have, any, friction, or, resistivity, at, the, microscopic, level, because, they, are, time, reversible, because, a, black, hole, eventually, achieves, a, stable, state, with, only, three, parameters, there, is, no, way, to, avoid, losing, information, about, the, initial, conditions, the, gravitational, and, electric, fields, of, a, black, hole, give, very, little, information, about, what, went, in, the, information, that, is, lost, includes, every, quantity, that, cannot, be, measured, far, away, from, the, black, hole, horizon, including, approximately, conserved, quantum, numbers, such, as, the, total, baryon, number, and, lepton, number, this, behaviour, is, so, puzzling, that, it, has, been, called, the, black, hole, information, loss, paradox, the, simplest, static, black, holes, have, mass, but, neither, electric, charge, nor, angular, momentum, these, black, holes, are, often, referred, to, as, schwarzschild, black, holes, after, karl, schwarzschild, who, discovered, this, solution, in, 1916, according, to, birkhoff, s, theorem, it, is, the, only, vacuum, solution, that, is, spherically, symmetric, this, means, there, is, no, observable, difference, at, a, distance, between, the, gravitational, field, of, such, a, black, hole, and, that, of, any, other, spherical, object, of, the, same, mass, the, popular, notion, of, a, black, hole, sucking, in, everything, in, its, surroundings, is, therefore, correct, only, near, a, black, hole, s, horizon, far, away, the, external, gravitational, field, is, identical, to, that, of, any, other, body, of, the, same, mass, solutions, describing, more, general, black, holes, also, exist, non, rotating, charged, black, holes, are, described, by, the, reissner, nordstr, m, metric, while, the, kerr, metric, describes, a, non, charged, rotating, black, hole, the, most, general, stationary, black, hole, solution, known, is, the, kerr, newman, metric, which, describes, a, black, hole, with, both, charge, and, angular, momentum, while, the, mass, of, a, black, hole, can, take, any, positive, value, the, charge, and, angular, momentum, are, constrained, by, the, mass, the, total, electric, charge, q, and, the, total, angular, momentum, j, are, expected, to, satisfy, the, inequality, for, a, black, hole, of, mass, m, black, holes, with, the, minimum, possible, mass, satisfying, this, inequality, are, called, extremal, solutions, of, einstein, s, equations, that, violate, this, inequality, exist, but, they, do, not, possess, an, event, horizon, these, solutions, have, so, called, naked, singularities, that, can, be, observed, from, the, outside, and, hence, are, deemed, unphysical, the, cosmic, censorship, hypothesis, rules, out, the, formation, of, such, singularities, when, they, are, created, through, the, gravitational, collapse, of, realistic, matter, this, is, supported, by, numerical, simulations, due, to, the, relatively, large, strength, of, the, electromagnetic, force, black, holes, forming, from, the, collapse, of, stars, are, expected, to, retain, the, nearly, neutral, charge, of, the, star, rotation, however, is, expected, to, be, a, universal, feature, of, compact, astrophysical, objects, the, black, hole, candidate, binary, x, ray, source, grs, 1915, 105, appears, to, have, an, angular, momentum, near, the, maximum, allowed, value, that, uncharged, limit, is, allowing, definition, of, a, dimensionless, spin, parameter, such, that, black, holes, are, commonly, classified, according, to, their, mass, independent, of, angular, momentum, j, the, size, of, a, black, hole, as, determined, by, the, radius, of, the, event, horizon, or, schwarzschild, radius, is, proportional, to, the, mass, m, through, where, r, s, is, the, schwarzschild, radius, and, m, is, the, mass, of, the, sun, for, a, black, hole, with, nonzero, spin, and, or, electric, charge, the, radius, is, smaller, until, an, extremal, black, hole, could, have, an, event, horizon, close, to, the, defining, feature, of, a, black, hole, is, the, appearance, of, an, event, horizon, a, boundary, in, spacetime, through, which, matter, and, light, can, pass, only, inward, towards, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, nothing, not, even, light, can, escape, from, inside, the, event, horizon, the, event, horizon, is, referred, to, as, such, because, if, an, event, occurs, within, the, boundary, information, from, that, event, cannot, reach, an, outside, observer, making, it, impossible, to, determine, whether, such, an, event, occurred, as, predicted, by, general, relativity, the, presence, of, a, mass, deforms, spacetime, in, such, a, way, that, the, paths, taken, by, particles, bend, towards, the, mass, at, the, event, horizon, of, a, black, hole, this, deformation, becomes, so, strong, that, there, are, no, paths, that, lead, away, from, the, black, hole, to, a, distant, observer, clocks, near, a, black, hole, would, appear, to, tick, more, slowly, than, those, farther, away, from, the, black, hole, due, to, this, effect, known, as, gravitational, time, dilation, an, object, falling, into, a, black, hole, appears, to, slow, as, it, approaches, the, event, horizon, taking, an, infinite, amount, of, time, to, reach, it, at, the, same, time, all, processes, on, this, object, slow, down, from, the, viewpoint, of, a, fixed, outside, observer, causing, any, light, emitted, by, the, object, to, appear, redder, and, dimmer, an, effect, known, as, gravitational, redshift, eventually, the, falling, object, fades, away, until, it, can, no, longer, be, seen, typically, this, process, happens, very, rapidly, with, an, object, disappearing, from, view, within, less, than, a, second, on, the, other, hand, indestructible, observers, falling, into, a, black, hole, do, not, notice, any, of, these, effects, as, they, cross, the, event, horizon, according, to, their, own, clocks, which, appear, to, them, to, tick, normally, they, cross, the, event, horizon, after, a, finite, time, without, noting, any, singular, behaviour, in, classical, general, relativity, it, is, impossible, to, determine, the, location, of, the, event, horizon, from, local, observations, due, to, einstein, s, equivalence, principle, the, topology, of, the, event, horizon, of, a, black, hole, at, equilibrium, is, always, spherical, for, non, rotating, static, black, holes, the, geometry, of, the, event, horizon, is, precisely, spherical, while, for, rotating, black, holes, the, event, horizon, is, oblate, at, the, centre, of, a, black, hole, as, described, by, general, relativity, may, lie, a, gravitational, singularity, a, region, where, the, spacetime, curvature, becomes, infinite, for, a, non, rotating, black, hole, this, region, takes, the, shape, of, a, single, point, for, a, rotating, black, hole, it, is, smeared, out, to, form, a, ring, singularity, that, lies, in, the, plane, of, rotation, in, both, cases, the, singular, region, has, zero, volume, it, can, also, be, shown, that, the, singular, region, contains, all, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, solution, the, singular, region, can, thus, be, thought, of, as, having, infinite, density, observers, falling, into, a, schwarzschild, black, hole, i, e, non, rotating, and, not, charged, cannot, avoid, being, carried, into, the, singularity, once, they, cross, the, event, horizon, they, can, prolong, the, experience, by, accelerating, away, to, slow, their, descent, but, only, up, to, a, limit, when, they, reach, the, singularity, they, are, crushed, to, infinite, density, and, their, mass, is, added, to, the, total, of, the, black, hole, before, that, happens, they, will, have, been, torn, apart, by, the, growing, tidal, forces, in, a, process, sometimes, referred, to, as, spaghettification, or, the, noodle, effect, in, the, case, of, a, charged, reissner, nordstr, m, or, rotating, kerr, black, hole, it, is, possible, to, avoid, the, singularity, extending, these, solutions, as, far, as, possible, reveals, the, hypothetical, possibility, of, exiting, the, black, hole, into, a, different, spacetime, with, the, black, hole, acting, as, a, wormhole, the, possibility, of, travelling, to, another, universe, is, however, only, theoretical, since, any, perturbation, would, destroy, this, possibility, it, also, appears, to, be, possible, to, follow, closed, timelike, curves, returning, to, one, s, own, past, around, the, kerr, singularity, which, leads, to, problems, with, causality, like, the, grandfather, paradox, it, is, expected, that, none, of, these, peculiar, effects, would, survive, in, a, proper, quantum, treatment, of, rotating, and, charged, black, holes, the, appearance, of, singularities, in, general, relativity, is, commonly, perceived, as, signalling, the, breakdown, of, the, theory, this, breakdown, however, is, expected, it, occurs, in, a, situation, where, quantum, effects, should, describe, these, actions, due, to, the, extremely, high, density, and, therefore, particle, interactions, to, date, it, has, not, been, possible, to, combine, quantum, and, gravitational, effects, into, a, single, theory, although, there, exist, attempts, to, formulate, such, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, it, is, generally, expected, that, such, a, theory, will, not, feature, any, singularities, the, photon, sphere, is, a, spherical, boundary, where, photons, that, move, on, tangents, to, that, sphere, would, be, trapped, in, a, non, stable, but, circular, orbit, around, the, black, hole, for, non, rotating, black, holes, the, photon, sphere, has, a, radius, 1, 5, times, the, schwarzschild, radius, their, orbits, would, be, dynamically, unstable, hence, any, small, perturbation, such, as, a, particle, of, infalling, matter, would, cause, an, instability, that, would, grow, over, time, either, setting, the, photon, on, an, outward, trajectory, causing, it, to, escape, the, black, hole, or, on, an, inward, spiral, where, it, would, eventually, cross, the, event, horizon, while, light, can, still, escape, from, the, photon, sphere, any, light, that, crosses, the, photon, sphere, on, an, inbound, trajectory, will, be, captured, by, the, black, hole, hence, any, light, that, reaches, an, outside, observer, from, the, photon, sphere, must, have, been, emitted, by, objects, between, the, photon, sphere, and, the, event, horizon, for, a, kerr, black, hole, the, radius, of, the, photon, sphere, depends, on, the, spin, parameter, and, on, the, details, of, the, photon, orbit, which, can, be, prograde, the, photon, rotates, in, the, same, sense, of, the, black, hole, spin, or, retrograde, rotating, black, holes, are, surrounded, by, a, region, of, spacetime, in, which, it, is, impossible, to, stand, still, called, the, ergosphere, this, is, the, result, of, a, process, known, as, frame, dragging, general, relativity, predicts, that, any, rotating, mass, will, tend, to, slightly, drag, along, the, spacetime, immediately, surrounding, it, any, object, near, the, rotating, mass, will, tend, to, start, moving, in, the, direction, of, rotation, for, a, rotating, black, hole, this, effect, is, so, strong, near, the, event, horizon, that, an, object, would, have, to, move, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, the, opposite, direction, to, just, stand, still, the, ergosphere, of, a, black, hole, is, a, volume, bounded, by, the, black, hole, s, event, horizon, and, the, ergosurface, which, coincides, with, the, event, horizon, at, the, poles, but, is, at, a, much, greater, distance, around, the, equator, objects, and, radiation, can, escape, normally, from, the, ergosphere, through, the, penrose, process, objects, can, emerge, from, the, ergosphere, with, more, energy, than, they, entered, with, the, extra, energy, is, taken, from, the, rotational, energy, of, the, black, hole, thereby, the, rotation, of, the, black, hole, slows, down, a, variation, of, the, penrose, process, in, the, presence, of, strong, magnetic, fields, the, blandford, znajek, process, is, considered, a, likely, mechanism, for, the, enormous, luminosity, and, relativistic, jets, of, quasars, and, other, active, galactic, nuclei, in, newtonian, gravity, test, particles, can, stably, orbit, at, arbitrary, distances, from, a, central, object, in, general, relativity, however, there, exists, an, innermost, stable, circular, orbit, often, called, the, isco, for, which, any, infinitesimal, inward, perturbations, to, a, circular, orbit, will, lead, to, spiraling, into, the, black, hole, and, any, outward, perturbations, will, depending, on, the, energy, result, in, spiraling, in, stably, orbiting, between, apastron, and, periastron, or, escaping, to, infinity, the, location, of, the, isco, depends, on, the, spin, of, the, black, hole, in, the, case, of, a, schwarzschild, black, hole, spin, zero, is, and, decreases, with, increasing, black, hole, spin, for, particles, orbiting, in, the, same, direction, as, the, spin, the, final, observable, region, of, spacetime, around, a, black, hole, is, called, the, plunging, region, in, this, area, it, is, no, longer, possible, for, matter, to, follow, circular, orbits, or, to, stop, a, final, descent, into, the, black, hole, instead, it, will, rapidly, plunge, toward, the, black, hole, close, to, the, speed, of, light, given, the, bizarre, character, of, black, holes, it, was, long, questioned, whether, such, objects, could, actually, exist, in, nature, or, whether, they, were, merely, pathological, solutions, to, einstein, s, equations, einstein, himself, wrongly, thought, black, holes, would, not, form, because, he, held, that, the, angular, momentum, of, collapsing, particles, would, stabilise, their, motion, at, some, radius, this, led, the, general, relativity, community, to, dismiss, all, results, to, the, contrary, for, many, years, however, a, minority, of, relativists, continued, to, contend, that, black, holes, were, physical, objects, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, they, had, persuaded, the, majority, of, researchers, in, the, field, that, there, is, no, obstacle, to, the, formation, of, an, event, horizon, penrose, demonstrated, that, once, an, event, horizon, forms, general, relativity, without, quantum, mechanics, requires, that, a, singularity, will, form, within, shortly, afterwards, hawking, showed, that, many, cosmological, solutions, that, describe, the, big, bang, have, singularities, without, scalar, fields, or, other, exotic, matter, the, kerr, solution, the, no, hair, theorem, and, the, laws, of, black, hole, thermodynamics, showed, that, the, physical, properties, of, black, holes, were, simple, and, comprehensible, making, them, respectable, subjects, for, research, conventional, black, holes, are, formed, by, gravitational, collapse, of, heavy, objects, such, as, stars, but, they, can, also, in, theory, be, formed, by, other, processes, gravitational, collapse, occurs, when, an, object, s, internal, pressure, is, insufficient, to, resist, the, object, s, own, gravity, for, stars, this, usually, occurs, either, because, a, star, has, too, little, fuel, left, to, maintain, its, temperature, through, stellar, nucleosynthesis, or, because, a, star, that, would, have, been, stable, receives, extra, matter, in, a, way, that, does, not, raise, its, core, temperature, in, either, case, the, star, s, temperature, is, no, longer, high, enough, to, prevent, it, from, collapsing, under, its, own, weight, the, collapse, may, be, stopped, by, the, degeneracy, pressure, of, the, star, s, constituents, allowing, the, condensation, of, matter, into, an, exotic, denser, state, the, result, is, one, of, the, various, types, of, compact, star, which, type, forms, depends, on, the, mass, of, the, remnant, of, the, original, star, left, if, the, outer, layers, have, been, blown, away, for, example, in, a, type, ii, supernova, the, mass, of, the, remnant, the, collapsed, object, that, survives, the, explosion, can, be, substantially, less, than, that, of, the, original, star, remnants, exceeding, 5, m, are, produced, by, stars, that, were, over, 20, m, before, the, collapse, if, the, mass, of, the, remnant, exceeds, about, 3, 4, m, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, either, because, the, original, star, was, very, heavy, or, because, the, remnant, collected, additional, mass, through, accretion, of, matter, even, the, degeneracy, pressure, of, neutrons, is, insufficient, to, stop, the, collapse, no, known, mechanism, except, possibly, quark, degeneracy, pressure, is, powerful, enough, to, stop, the, implosion, and, the, object, will, inevitably, collapse, to, form, a, black, hole, the, gravitational, collapse, of, heavy, stars, is, assumed, to, be, responsible, for, the, formation, of, stellar, mass, black, holes, star, formation, in, the, early, universe, may, have, resulted, in, very, massive, stars, which, upon, their, collapse, would, have, produced, black, holes, of, up, to, 10, 3, m, these, black, holes, could, be, the, seeds, of, the, supermassive, black, holes, found, in, the, centres, of, most, galaxies, it, has, further, been, suggested, that, massive, black, holes, with, typical, masses, of, 10, 5, m, could, have, formed, from, the, direct, collapse, of, gas, clouds, in, the, young, universe, these, massive, objects, have, been, proposed, as, the, seeds, that, eventually, formed, the, earliest, quasars, observed, already, at, redshift, z, 7, displaystyle, z, sim, 7, some, candidates, for, such, objects, have, been, found, in, observations, of, the, young, universe, while, most, of, the, energy, released, during, gravitational, collapse, is, emitted, very, quickly, an, outside, observer, does, not, actually, see, the, end, of, this, process, even, though, the, collapse, takes, a, finite, amount, of, time, from, the, reference, frame, of, infalling, matter, a, distant, observer, would, see, the, infalling, material, slow, and, halt, just, above, the, event, horizon, due, to, gravitational, time, dilation, light, from, the, collapsing, material, takes, longer, and, longer, to, reach, the, observer, with, the, light, emitted, just, before, the, event, horizon, forms, delayed, an, infinite, amount, of, time, thus, the, external, observer, never, sees, the, formation, of, the, event, horizon, instead, the, collapsing, material, seems, to, become, dimmer, and, increasingly, red, shifted, eventually, fading, away, gravitational, collapse, requires, great, density, in, the, current, epoch, of, the, universe, these, high, densities, are, found, only, in, stars, but, in, the, early, universe, shortly, after, the, big, bang, densities, were, much, greater, possibly, allowing, for, the, creation, of, black, holes, high, density, alone, is, not, enough, to, allow, black, hole, formation, since, a, uniform, mass, distribution, will, not, allow, the, mass, to, bunch, up, in, order, for, primordial, black, holes, to, have, formed, in, such, a, dense, medium, there, must, have, been, initial, density, perturbations, that, could, then, grow, under, their, own, gravity, different, models, for, the, early, universe, vary, widely, in, their, predictions, of, the, scale, of, these, fluctuations, various, models, predict, the, creation, of, primordial, black, holes, ranging, in, size, from, a, planck, mass, m, p, c, g, displaystyle, m, p, sqrt, hbar, c, g, 1, 2, 10, 19, gev, c, 2, 2, 2, 10, 8, kg, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, solar, masses, despite, the, early, universe, being, extremely, dense, it, did, not, re, collapse, into, a, black, hole, during, the, big, bang, since, the, expansion, rate, was, greater, than, the, attraction, following, inflation, theory, there, was, a, net, repulsive, gravitation, in, the, beginning, until, the, end, of, inflation, since, then, the, hubble, flow, was, slowed, by, the, energy, density, of, the, universe, models, for, the, gravitational, collapse, of, objects, of, relatively, constant, size, such, as, stars, do, not, necessarily, apply, in, the, same, way, to, rapidly, expanding, space, such, as, the, big, bang, gravitational, collapse, is, not, the, only, process, that, could, create, black, holes, in, principle, black, holes, could, be, formed, in, high, energy, collisions, that, achieve, sufficient, density, as, of, 2002, no, such, events, have, been, detected, either, directly, or, indirectly, as, a, deficiency, of, the, mass, balance, in, particle, accelerator, experiments, this, suggests, that, there, must, be, a, lower, limit, for, the, mass, of, black, holes, theoretically, this, boundary, is, expected, to, lie, around, the, planck, mass, where, quantum, effects, are, expected, to, invalidate, the, predictions, of, general, relativity, this, would, put, the, creation, of, black, holes, firmly, out, of, reach, of, any, high, energy, process, occurring, on, or, near, the, earth, however, certain, developments, in, quantum, gravity, suggest, that, the, minimum, black, hole, mass, could, be, much, lower, some, braneworld, scenarios, for, example, put, the, boundary, as, low, as, 1, tev, c, 2, this, would, make, it, conceivable, for, micro, black, holes, to, be, created, in, the, high, energy, collisions, that, occur, when, cosmic, rays, hit, the, earth, s, atmosphere, or, possibly, in, the, large, hadron, collider, at, cern, these, theories, are, very, speculative, and, the, creation, of, black, holes, in, these, processes, is, deemed, unlikely, by, many, specialists, even, if, micro, black, holes, could, be, formed, it, is, expected, that, they, would, evaporate, in, about, 10, 25, seconds, posing, no, threat, to, the, earth, once, a, black, hole, has, formed, it, can, continue, to, grow, by, absorbing, additional, matter, any, black, hole, will, continually, absorb, gas, and, interstellar, dust, from, its, surroundings, this, growth, process, is, one, possible, way, through, which, some, supermassive, black, holes, may, have, been, formed, although, the, formation, of, supermassive, black, holes, is, still, an, open, field, of, research, a, similar, process, has, been, suggested, for, the, formation, of, intermediate, mass, black, holes, found, in, globular, clusters, black, holes, can, also, merge, with, other, objects, such, as, stars, or, even, other, black, holes, this, is, thought, to, have, been, important, especially, in, the, early, growth, of, supermassive, black, holes, which, could, have, formed, from, the, aggregation, of, many, smaller, objects, the, process, has, also, been, proposed, as, the, origin, of, some, intermediate, mass, black, holes, in, 1974, hawking, predicted, that, black, holes, are, not, entirely, black, but, emit, small, amounts, of, thermal, radiation, at, a, temperature, c, 3, 8, gm, k, b, this, effect, has, become, known, as, hawking, radiation, by, applying, quantum, field, theory, to, a, static, black, hole, background, he, determined, that, a, black, hole, should, emit, particles, that, display, a, perfect, black, body, spectrum, since, hawking, s, publication, many, others, have, verified, the, result, through, various, approaches, if, hawking, s, theory, of, black, hole, radiation, is, correct, then, black, holes, are, expected, to, shrink, and, evaporate, over, time, as, they, lose, mass, by, the, emission, of, photons, and, other, particles, the, temperature, of, this, thermal, spectrum, hawking, temperature, is, proportional, to, the, surface, gravity, of, the, black, hole, which, for, a, schwarzschild, black, hole, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, mass, hence, large, black, holes, emit, less, radiation, than, small, black, holes, a, stellar, black, hole, of, 1, m, has, a, hawking, temperature, of, 62, nanokelvins, this, is, far, less, than, the, 2, 7, k, temperature, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, stellar, mass, or, larger, black, holes, receive, more, mass, from, the, cosmic, microwave, background, than, they, emit, through, hawking, radiation, and, thus, will, grow, instead, of, shrinking, to, have, a, hawking, temperature, larger, than, 2, 7, k, and, be, able, to, evaporate, a, black, hole, would, need, a, mass, less, than, the, moon, such, a, black, hole, would, have, a, diameter, of, less, than, a, tenth, of, a, millimetre, if, a, black, hole, is, very, small, the, radiation, effects, are, expected, to, become, very, strong, a, black, hole, with, the, mass, of, a, car, would, have, a, diameter, of, about, 10, 24, m, and, take, a, nanosecond, to, evaporate, during, which, time, it, would, briefly, have, a, luminosity, of, more, than, 200, times, that, of, the, sun, lower, mass, black, holes, are, expected, to, evaporate, even, faster, for, example, a, black, hole, of, mass, 1, tev, c, 2, would, take, less, than, 10, 88, seconds, to, evaporate, completely, for, such, a, small, black, hole, quantum, gravity, effects, are, expected, to, play, an, important, role, and, could, hypothetically, make, such, a, small, black, hole, stable, although, current, developments, in, quantum, gravity, do, not, indicate, this, is, the, case, the, hawking, radiation, for, an, astrophysical, black, hole, is, predicted, to, be, very, weak, and, would, thus, be, exceedingly, difficult, to, detect, from, earth, a, possible, exception, however, is, the, burst, of, gamma, rays, emitted, in, the, last, stage, of, the, evaporation, of, primordial, black, holes, searches, for, such, flashes, have, proven, unsuccessful, and, provide, stringent, limits, on, the, possibility, of, existence, of, low, mass, primordial, black, holes, nasa, s, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, launched, in, 2008, will, continue, the, search, for, these, flashes, if, black, holes, evaporate, via, hawking, radiation, a, solar, mass, black, hole, will, evaporate, beginning, once, the, temperature, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, drops, below, that, of, the, black, hole, over, a, period, of, 10, 64, years, a, supermassive, black, hole, with, a, mass, of, 10, 11, m, will, evaporate, in, around, 2, 10, 100, years, some, monster, black, holes, in, the, universe, are, predicted, to, continue, to, grow, up, to, perhaps, 10, 14, m, during, the, collapse, of, superclusters, of, galaxies, even, these, would, evaporate, over, a, timescale, of, up, to, 10, 106, years, by, nature, black, holes, do, not, themselves, emit, any, electromagnetic, radiation, other, than, the, hypothetical, hawking, radiation, so, astrophysicists, searching, for, black, holes, must, generally, rely, on, indirect, observations, for, example, a, black, hole, s, existence, can, sometimes, be, inferred, by, observing, its, gravitational, influence, on, its, surroundings, the, event, horizon, telescope, eht, is, an, active, program, that, directly, observes, the, immediate, environment, of, black, holes, event, horizons, such, as, the, black, hole, at, the, centre, of, the, milky, way, in, april, 2017, eht, began, observing, the, black, hole, at, the, centre, of, messier, 87, in, all, eight, radio, observatories, on, six, mountains, and, four, continents, observed, the, galaxy, in, virgo, on, and, off, for, 10, days, in, april, 2017, to, provide, the, data, yielding, the, image, in, april, 2019, after, two, years, of, data, processing, eht, released, the, first, direct, image, of, a, black, hole, specifically, the, supermassive, black, hole, that, lies, in, the, centre, of, the, aforementioned, galaxy, what, is, visible, is, not, the, black, hole, which, shows, as, black, because, of, the, loss, of, all, light, within, this, dark, region, instead, it, is, the, gases, at, the, edge, of, the, event, horizon, displayed, as, orange, or, red, that, define, the, black, hole, on, 12, may, 2022, the, eht, released, the, first, image, of, sagittarius, a, the, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, centre, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, published, image, displayed, the, same, ring, like, structure, and, circular, shadow, as, seen, in, the, m87, black, hole, and, the, image, was, created, using, the, same, techniques, as, for, the, m87, black, hole, the, imaging, process, for, sagittarius, a, which, is, more, than, a, thousand, times, smaller, and, less, massive, than, m87, was, significantly, more, complex, because, of, the, instability, of, its, surroundings, the, image, of, sagittarius, a, was, partially, blurred, by, turbulent, plasma, on, the, way, to, the, galactic, centre, an, effect, which, prevents, resolution, of, the, image, at, longer, wavelengths, the, brightening, of, this, material, in, the, bottom, half, of, the, processed, eht, image, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, doppler, beaming, whereby, material, approaching, the, viewer, at, relativistic, speeds, is, perceived, as, brighter, than, material, moving, away, in, the, case, of, a, black, hole, this, phenomenon, implies, that, the, visible, material, is, rotating, at, relativistic, speeds, 1, 000, km, s, the, only, speeds, at, which, it, is, possible, to, centrifugally, balance, the, immense, gravitational, attraction, of, the, singularity, and, thereby, remain, in, orbit, above, the, event, horizon, this, configuration, of, bright, material, implies, that, the, eht, observed, m87, from, a, perspective, catching, the, black, hole, s, accretion, disc, nearly, edge, on, as, the, whole, system, rotated, clockwise, the, extreme, gravitational, lensing, associated, with, black, holes, produces, the, illusion, of, a, perspective, that, sees, the, accretion, disc, from, above, in, reality, most, of, the, ring, in, the, eht, image, was, created, when, the, light, emitted, by, the, far, side, of, the, accretion, disc, bent, around, the, black, hole, s, gravity, well, and, escaped, meaning, that, most, of, the, possible, perspectives, on, m87, can, see, the, entire, disc, even, that, directly, behind, the, shadow, in, 2015, the, eht, detected, magnetic, fields, just, outside, the, event, horizon, of, sagittarius, a, and, even, discerned, some, of, their, properties, the, field, lines, that, pass, through, the, accretion, disc, were, a, complex, mixture, of, ordered, and, tangled, theoretical, studies, of, black, holes, had, predicted, the, existence, of, magnetic, fields, in, april, 2023, an, image, of, the, shadow, of, the, messier, 87, black, hole, and, the, related, high, energy, jet, viewed, together, for, the, first, time, was, presented, on, 14, september, 2015, the, ligo, gravitational, wave, observatory, made, the, first, ever, successful, direct, observation, of, gravitational, waves, the, signal, was, consistent, with, theoretical, predictions, for, the, gravitational, waves, produced, by, the, merger, of, two, black, holes, one, with, about, 36, solar, masses, and, the, other, around, 29, solar, masses, this, observation, provides, the, most, concrete, evidence, for, the, existence, of, black, holes, to, date, for, instance, the, gravitational, wave, signal, suggests, that, the, separation, of, the, two, objects, before, the, merger, was, just, 350, km, or, roughly, four, times, the, schwarzschild, radius, corresponding, to, the, inferred, masses, the, objects, must, therefore, have, been, extremely, compact, leaving, black, holes, as, the, most, plausible, interpretation, more, importantly, the, signal, observed, by, ligo, also, included, the, start, of, the, post, merger, ringdown, the, signal, produced, as, the, newly, formed, compact, object, settles, down, to, a, stationary, state, arguably, the, ringdown, is, the, most, direct, way, of, observing, a, black, hole, from, the, ligo, signal, it, is, possible, to, extract, the, frequency, and, damping, time, of, the, dominant, mode, of, the, ringdown, from, these, it, is, possible, to, infer, the, mass, and, angular, momentum, of, the, final, object, which, match, independent, predictions, from, numerical, simulations, of, the, merger, the, frequency, and, decay, time, of, the, dominant, mode, are, determined, by, the, geometry, of, the, photon, sphere, hence, observation, of, this, mode, confirms, the, presence, of, a, photon, sphere, however, it, cannot, exclude, possible, exotic, alternatives, to, black, holes, that, are, compact, enough, to, have, a, photon, sphere, the, observation, also, provides, the, first, observational, evidence, for, the, existence, of, stellar, mass, black, hole, binaries, furthermore, it, is, the, first, observational, evidence, of, stellar, mass, black, holes, weighing, 25, solar, masses, or, more, since, then, many, more, gravitational, wave, events, have, been, observed, the, proper, motions, of, stars, near, the, centre, of, our, own, milky, way, provide, strong, observational, evidence, that, these, stars, are, orbiting, a, supermassive, black, hole, since, 1995, astronomers, have, tracked, the, motions, of, 90, stars, orbiting, an, invisible, object, coincident, with, the, radio, source, sagittarius, a, by, fitting, their, motions, to, keplerian, orbits, the, astronomers, were, able, to, infer, in, 1998, that, a, 2, 6, 10, 6, m, object, must, be, contained, in, a, volume, with, a, radius, of, 0, 02, light, years, to, cause, the, motions, of, those, stars, since, then, one, of, the, stars, called, s2, has, completed, a, full, orbit, from, the, orbital, data, astronomers, were, able, to, refine, the, calculations, of, the, mass, to, 4, 3, 10, 6, m, and, a, radius, of, less, than, 0, 002, light, years, for, the, object, causing, the, orbital, motion, of, those, stars, the, upper, limit, on, the, object, s, size, is, still, too, large, to, test, whether, it, is, smaller, than, its, schwarzschild, radius, nevertheless, these, observations, strongly, suggest, that, the, central, object, is, a, supermassive, black, hole, as, there, are, no, other, plausible, scenarios, for, confining, so, much, invisible, mass, into, such, a, small, volume, additionally, there, is, some, observational, evidence, that, this, object, might, possess, an, event, horizon, a, feature, unique, to, black, holes, due, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, gas, falling, into, the, gravitational, well, created, by, a, massive, object, will, typically, form, a, disk, like, structure, around, the, object, artists, impressions, such, as, the, accompanying, representation, of, a, black, hole, with, corona, commonly, depict, the, black, hole, as, if, it, were, a, flat, space, body, hiding, the, part, of, the, disk, just, behind, it, but, in, reality, gravitational, lensing, would, greatly, distort, the, image, of, the, accretion, disk, within, such, a, disk, friction, would, cause, angular, momentum, to, be, transported, outward, allowing, matter, to, fall, farther, inward, thus, releasing, potential, energy, and, increasing, the, temperature, of, the, gas, when, the, accreting, object, is, a, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, the, gas, in, the, inner, accretion, disk, orbits, at, very, high, speeds, because, of, its, proximity, to, the, compact, object, the, resulting, friction, is, so, significant, that, it, heats, the, inner, disk, to, temperatures, at, which, it, emits, vast, amounts, of, electromagnetic, radiation, mainly, x, rays, these, bright, x, ray, sources, may, be, detected, by, telescopes, this, process, of, accretion, is, one, of, the, most, efficient, energy, producing, processes, known, up, to, 40, of, the, rest, mass, of, the, accreted, material, can, be, emitted, as, radiation, in, nuclear, fusion, only, about, 0, 7, of, the, rest, mass, will, be, emitted, as, energy, in, many, cases, accretion, disks, are, accompanied, by, relativistic, jets, that, are, emitted, along, the, poles, which, carry, away, much, of, the, energy, the, mechanism, for, the, creation, of, these, jets, is, currently, not, well, understood, in, part, due, to, insufficient, data, as, such, many, of, the, universe, s, more, energetic, phenomena, have, been, attributed, to, the, accretion, of, matter, on, black, holes, in, particular, active, galactic, nuclei, and, quasars, are, believed, to, be, the, accretion, disks, of, supermassive, black, holes, similarly, x, ray, binaries, are, generally, accepted, to, be, binary, star, systems, in, which, one, of, the, two, stars, is, a, compact, object, accreting, matter, from, its, companion, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, some, ultraluminous, x, ray, sources, may, be, the, accretion, disks, of, intermediate, mass, black, holes, stars, have, been, observed, to, get, torn, apart, by, tidal, forces, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, supermassive, black, holes, in, galaxy, nuclei, in, what, is, known, as, a, tidal, disruption, event, tde, some, of, the, material, from, the, disrupted, star, forms, an, accretion, disk, around, the, black, hole, which, emits, observable, electromagnetic, radiation, in, november, 2011, the, first, direct, observation, of, a, quasar, accretion, disk, around, a, supermassive, black, hole, was, reported, x, ray, binaries, are, binary, star, systems, that, emit, a, majority, of, their, radiation, in, the, x, ray, part, of, the, spectrum, these, x, ray, emissions, are, generally, thought, to, result, when, one, of, the, stars, compact, object, accretes, matter, from, another, regular, star, the, presence, of, an, ordinary, star, in, such, a, system, provides, an, opportunity, for, studying, the, central, object, and, to, determine, if, it, might, be, a, black, hole, if, such, a, system, emits, signals, that, can, be, directly, traced, back, to, the, compact, object, it, cannot, be, a, black, hole, the, absence, of, such, a, signal, does, however, not, exclude, the, possibility, that, the, compact, object, is, a, neutron, star, by, studying, the, companion, star, it, is, often, possible, to, obtain, the, orbital, parameters, of, the, system, and, to, obtain, an, estimate, for, the, mass, of, the, compact, object, if, this, is, much, larger, than, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, the, maximum, mass, a, star, can, have, without, collapsing, then, the, object, cannot, be, a, neutron, star, and, is, generally, expected, to, be, a, black, hole, the, first, strong, candidate, for, a, black, hole, cygnus, x, 1, was, discovered, in, this, way, by, charles, thomas, bolton, louise, webster, and, paul, murdin, in, 1972, some, doubt, remained, due, to, the, uncertainties, that, result, from, the, companion, star, being, much, heavier, than, the, candidate, black, hole, currently, better, candidates, for, black, holes, are, found, in, a, class, of, x, ray, binaries, called, soft, x, ray, transients, in, this, class, of, system, the, companion, star, is, of, relatively, low, mass, allowing, for, more, accurate, estimates, of, the, black, hole, mass, these, systems, actively, emit, x, rays, for, only, several, months, once, every, 10, 50, years, during, the, period, of, low, x, ray, emission, called, quiescence, the, accretion, disk, is, extremely, faint, allowing, detailed, observation, of, the, companion, star, during, this, period, one, of, the, best, such, candidates, is, v404, cygni, the, x, ray, emissions, from, accretion, disks, sometimes, flicker, at, certain, frequencies, these, signals, are, called, quasi, periodic, oscillations, and, are, thought, to, be, caused, by, material, moving, along, the, inner, edge, of, the, accretion, disk, the, innermost, stable, circular, orbit, as, such, their, frequency, is, linked, to, the, mass, of, the, compact, object, they, can, thus, be, used, as, an, alternative, way, to, determine, the, mass, of, candidate, black, holes, astronomers, use, the, term, active, galaxy, to, describe, galaxies, with, unusual, characteristics, such, as, unusual, spectral, line, emission, and, very, strong, radio, emission, theoretical, and, observational, studies, have, shown, that, the, activity, in, these, active, galactic, nuclei, agn, may, be, explained, by, the, presence, of, supermassive, black, holes, which, can, be, millions, of, times, more, massive, than, stellar, ones, the, models, of, these, agn, consist, of, a, central, black, hole, that, may, be, millions, or, billions, of, times, more, massive, than, the, sun, a, disk, of, interstellar, gas, and, dust, called, an, accretion, disk, and, two, jets, perpendicular, to, the, accretion, disk, although, supermassive, black, holes, are, expected, to, be, found, in, most, agn, only, some, galaxies, nuclei, have, been, more, carefully, studied, in, attempts, to, both, identify, and, measure, the, actual, masses, of, the, central, supermassive, black, hole, candidates, some, of, the, most, notable, galaxies, with, supermassive, black, hole, candidates, include, the, andromeda, galaxy, m32, m87, ngc, 3115, ngc, 3377, ngc, 4258, ngc, 4889, ngc, 1277, oj, 287, apm, 08279, 5255, and, the, sombrero, galaxy, it, is, now, widely, accepted, that, the, centre, of, nearly, every, galaxy, not, just, active, ones, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, the, close, observational, correlation, between, the, mass, of, this, hole, and, the, velocity, dispersion, of, the, host, galaxy, s, bulge, known, as, the, m, sigma, relation, strongly, suggests, a, connection, between, the, formation, of, the, black, hole, and, that, of, the, galaxy, itself, another, way, the, black, hole, nature, of, an, object, may, be, tested, is, through, observation, of, effects, caused, by, a, strong, gravitational, field, in, their, vicinity, one, such, effect, is, gravitational, lensing, the, deformation, of, spacetime, around, a, massive, object, causes, light, rays, to, be, deflected, such, as, light, passing, through, an, optic, lens, observations, have, been, made, of, weak, gravitational, lensing, in, which, light, rays, are, deflected, by, only, a, few, arcseconds, microlensing, occurs, when, the, sources, are, unresolved, and, the, observer, sees, a, small, brightening, in, january, 2022, astronomers, reported, the, first, possible, detection, of, a, microlensing, event, from, an, isolated, black, hole, another, possibility, for, observing, gravitational, lensing, by, a, black, hole, would, be, to, observe, stars, orbiting, the, black, hole, there, are, several, candidates, for, such, an, observation, in, orbit, around, sagittarius, a, the, evidence, for, stellar, black, holes, strongly, relies, on, the, existence, of, an, upper, limit, for, the, mass, of, a, neutron, star, the, size, of, this, limit, heavily, depends, on, the, assumptions, made, about, the, properties, of, dense, matter, new, exotic, phases, of, matter, could, push, up, this, bound, a, phase, of, free, quarks, at, high, density, might, allow, the, existence, of, dense, quark, stars, and, some, supersymmetric, models, predict, the, existence, of, q, stars, some, extensions, of, the, standard, model, posit, the, existence, of, preons, as, fundamental, building, blocks, of, quarks, and, leptons, which, could, hypothetically, form, preon, stars, these, hypothetical, models, could, potentially, explain, a, number, of, observations, of, stellar, black, hole, candidates, however, it, can, be, shown, from, arguments, in, general, relativity, that, any, such, object, will, have, a, maximum, mass, since, the, average, density, of, a, black, hole, inside, its, schwarzschild, radius, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, its, mass, supermassive, black, holes, are, much, less, dense, than, stellar, black, holes, the, average, density, of, a, 10, 8, m, black, hole, is, comparable, to, that, of, water, consequently, the, physics, of, matter, forming, a, supermassive, black, hole, is, much, better, understood, and, the, possible, alternative, explanations, for, supermassive, black, hole, observations, are, much, more, mundane, for, example, a, supermassive, black, hole, could, be, modelled, by, a, large, cluster, of, very, dark, objects, however, such, alternatives, are, typically, not, stable, enough, to, explain, the, supermassive, black, hole, candidates, the, evidence, for, the, existence, of, stellar, and, supermassive, black, holes, implies, that, in, order, for, black, holes, not, to, form, general, relativity, must, fail, as, a, theory, of, gravity, perhaps, due, to, the, onset, of, quantum, mechanical, corrections, a, much, anticipated, feature, of, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, is, that, it, will, not, feature, singularities, or, event, horizons, and, thus, black, holes, would, not, be, real, artefacts, for, example, in, the, fuzzball, model, based, on, string, theory, the, individual, states, of, a, black, hole, solution, do, not, generally, have, an, event, horizon, or, singularity, but, for, a, classical, semiclassical, observer, the, statistical, average, of, such, states, appears, just, as, an, ordinary, black, hole, as, deduced, from, general, relativity, a, few, theoretical, objects, have, been, conjectured, to, match, observations, of, astronomical, black, hole, candidates, identically, or, near, identically, but, which, function, via, a, different, mechanism, these, include, the, gravastar, the, black, star, related, nestar, and, the, dark, energy, star, in, 1971, hawking, showed, under, general, conditions, that, the, total, area, of, the, event, horizons, of, any, collection, of, classical, black, holes, can, never, decrease, even, if, they, collide, and, merge, this, result, now, known, as, the, second, law, of, black, hole, mechanics, is, remarkably, similar, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, which, states, that, the, total, entropy, of, an, isolated, system, can, never, decrease, as, with, classical, objects, at, absolute, zero, temperature, it, was, assumed, that, black, holes, had, zero, entropy, if, this, were, the, case, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, would, be, violated, by, entropy, laden, matter, entering, a, black, hole, resulting, in, a, decrease, in, the, total, entropy, of, the, universe, therefore, bekenstein, proposed, that, a, black, hole, should, have, an, entropy, and, that, it, should, be, proportional, to, its, horizon, area, the, link, with, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, was, further, strengthened, by, hawking, s, discovery, in, 1974, that, quantum, field, theory, predicts, that, a, black, hole, radiates, blackbody, radiation, at, a, constant, temperature, this, seemingly, causes, a, violation, of, the, second, law, of, black, hole, mechanics, since, the, radiation, will, carry, away, energy, from, the, black, hole, causing, it, to, shrink, the, radiation, also, carries, away, entropy, and, it, can, be, proven, under, general, assumptions, that, the, sum, of, the, entropy, of, the, matter, surrounding, a, black, hole, and, one, quarter, of, the, area, of, the, horizon, as, measured, in, planck, units, is, in, fact, always, increasing, this, allows, the, formulation, of, the, first, law, of, black, hole, mechanics, as, an, analogue, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, with, the, mass, acting, as, energy, the, surface, gravity, as, temperature, and, the, area, as, entropy, one, puzzling, feature, is, that, the, entropy, of, a, black, hole, scales, with, its, area, rather, than, with, its, volume, since, entropy, is, normally, an, extensive, quantity, that, scales, linearly, with, the, volume, of, the, system, this, odd, property, led, gerard, t, hooft, and, leonard, susskind, to, propose, the, holographic, principle, which, suggests, that, anything, that, happens, in, a, volume, of, spacetime, can, be, described, by, data, on, the, boundary, of, that, volume, although, general, relativity, can, be, used, to, perform, a, semiclassical, calculation, of, black, hole, entropy, this, situation, is, theoretically, unsatisfying, in, statistical, mechanics, entropy, is, understood, as, counting, the, number, of, microscopic, configurations, of, a, system, that, have, the, same, macroscopic, qualities, such, as, mass, charge, pressure, etc, without, a, satisfactory, theory, of, quantum, gravity, one, cannot, perform, such, a, computation, for, black, holes, some, progress, has, been, made, in, various, approaches, to, quantum, gravity, in, 1995, andrew, strominger, and, cumrun, vafa, showed, that, counting, the, microstates, of, a, specific, supersymmetric, black, hole, in, string, theory, reproduced, the, bekenstein, hawking, entropy, since, then, similar, results, have, been, reported, for, different, black, holes, both, in, string, theory, and, in, other, approaches, to, quantum, gravity, like, loop, quantum, gravity, because, a, black, hole, has, only, a, few, internal, parameters, most, of, the, information, about, the, matter, that, went, into, forming, the, black, hole, is, lost, regardless, of, the, type, of, matter, which, goes, into, a, black, hole, it, appears, that, only, information, concerning, the, total, mass, charge, and, angular, momentum, are, conserved, as, long, as, black, holes, were, thought, to, persist, forever, this, information, loss, is, not, that, problematic, as, the, information, can, be, thought, of, as, existing, inside, the, black, hole, inaccessible, from, the, outside, but, represented, on, the, event, horizon, in, accordance, with, the, holographic, principle, however, black, holes, slowly, evaporate, by, emitting, hawking, radiation, this, radiation, does, not, appear, to, carry, any, additional, information, about, the, matter, that, formed, the, black, hole, meaning, that, this, information, appears, to, be, gone, forever, the, question, whether, information, is, truly, lost, in, black, holes, the, black, hole, information, paradox, has, divided, the, theoretical, physics, community, in, quantum, mechanics, loss, of, information, corresponds, to, the, violation, of, a, property, called, unitarity, and, it, has, been, argued, that, loss, of, unitarity, would, also, imply, violation, of, conservation, of, energy, though, this, has, also, been, disputed, over, recent, years, evidence, has, been, building, that, indeed, information, and, unitarity, are, preserved, in, a, full, quantum, gravitational, treatment, of, the, problem, one, attempt, to, resolve, the, black, hole, information, paradox, is, known, as, black, hole, complementarity, in, 2012, the, firewall, paradox, was, introduced, with, the, goal, of, demonstrating, that, black, hole, complementarity, fails, to, solve, the, information, paradox, according, to, quantum, field, theory, in, curved, spacetime, a, single, emission, of, hawking, radiation, involves, two, mutually, entangled, particles, the, outgoing, particle, escapes, and, is, emitted, as, a, quantum, of, hawking, radiation, the, infalling, particle, is, swallowed, by, the, black, hole, assume, a, black, hole, formed, a, finite, time, in, the, past, and, will, fully, evaporate, away, in, some, finite, time, in, the, future, then, it, will, emit, only, a, finite, amount, of, information, encoded, within, its, hawking, radiation, according, to, research, by, physicists, like, don, page, and, leonard, susskind, there, will, eventually, be, a, time, by, which, an, outgoing, particle, must, be, entangled, with, all, the, hawking, radiation, the, black, hole, has, previously, emitted, this, seemingly, creates, a, paradox, a, principle, called, monogamy, of, entanglement, requires, that, like, any, quantum, system, the, outgoing, particle, cannot, be, fully, entangled, with, two, other, systems, at, the, same, time, yet, here, the, outgoing, particle, appears, to, be, entangled, both, with, the, infalling, particle, and, independently, with, past, hawking, radiation, in, order, to, resolve, this, contradiction, physicists, may, eventually, be, forced, to, give, up, one, of, three, time, tested, principles, einstein, s, equivalence, principle, unitarity, or, local, quantum, field, theory, one, possible, solution, which, violates, the, equivalence, principle, is, that, a, firewall, destroys, incoming, particles, at, the, event, horizon, in, general, which, if, any, of, these, assumptions, should, be, abandoned, remains, a, topic, of, debate
