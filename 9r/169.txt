https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox
a, solar, equinox, is, a, moment, in, time, when, the, sun, crosses, the, earth, s, equator, which, is, to, say, appears, directly, above, the, equator, rather, than, north, or, south, of, the, equator, on, the, day, of, the, equinox, the, sun, appears, to, rise, due, east, and, set, due, west, this, occurs, twice, each, year, around, 20, march, and, 23, september, more, precisely, an, equinox, is, traditionally, defined, as, the, time, when, the, plane, of, earth, s, equator, passes, through, the, geometric, center, of, the, sun, s, disk, equivalently, this, is, the, moment, when, earth, s, rotation, axis, is, directly, perpendicular, to, the, sun, earth, line, tilting, neither, toward, nor, away, from, the, sun, in, modern, times, since, the, moon, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, planets, causes, earth, s, orbit, to, vary, slightly, from, a, perfect, ellipse, the, equinox, is, officially, defined, by, the, sun, s, more, regular, ecliptic, longitude, rather, than, by, its, declination, the, instants, of, the, equinoxes, are, currently, defined, to, be, when, the, apparent, geocentric, longitude, of, the, sun, is, 0, and, 180, the, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, aequinoctium, from, aequus, equal, and, nox, night, on, the, day, of, an, equinox, daytime, and, nighttime, are, of, approximately, equal, duration, all, over, the, planet, contrary, to, popular, belief, they, are, not, exactly, equal, because, of, the, angular, size, of, the, sun, atmospheric, refraction, and, the, rapidly, changing, duration, of, the, length, of, day, that, occurs, at, most, latitudes, around, the, equinoxes, long, before, conceiving, this, equality, primitive, equatorial, cultures, noted, the, day, when, the, sun, rises, due, east, and, sets, due, west, and, indeed, this, happens, on, the, day, closest, to, the, astronomically, defined, event, as, a, consequence, according, to, a, properly, constructed, and, aligned, sundial, the, daytime, duration, is, 12, hours, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, march, equinox, is, called, the, vernal, or, spring, equinox, while, the, september, equinox, is, called, the, autumnal, or, fall, equinox, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, reverse, is, true, during, the, year, equinoxes, alternate, with, solstices, leap, years, and, other, factors, cause, the, dates, of, both, events, to, vary, slightly, hemisphere, neutral, names, are, northward, equinox, for, the, march, equinox, indicating, that, at, that, moment, the, solar, declination, is, crossing, the, celestial, equator, in, a, northward, direction, and, southward, equinox, for, the, september, equinox, indicating, that, at, that, moment, the, solar, declination, is, crossing, the, celestial, equator, in, a, southward, direction, daytime, is, increasing, at, the, fastest, at, the, vernal, equinox, and, decreasing, at, the, fastest, at, the, autumnal, equinox, systematically, observing, the, sunrise, people, discovered, that, it, occurs, between, two, extreme, locations, at, the, horizon, and, eventually, noted, the, midpoint, between, the, two, later, it, was, realized, that, this, happens, on, a, day, when, the, duration, of, the, day, and, the, night, are, practically, equal, and, the, word, equinox, comes, from, latin, aequus, meaning, equal, and, nox, meaning, night, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, vernal, equinox, march, conventionally, marks, the, beginning, of, spring, in, most, cultures, and, is, considered, the, start, of, the, new, year, in, the, assyrian, calendar, hindu, and, the, persian, or, iranian, calendars, while, the, autumnal, equinox, september, marks, the, beginning, of, autumn, ancient, greek, calendars, too, had, the, beginning, of, the, year, either, at, the, autumnal, or, vernal, equinox, and, some, at, solstices, the, antikythera, mechanism, predicts, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, the, equinoxes, are, the, only, times, when, the, solar, terminator, the, edge, between, night, and, day, is, perpendicular, to, the, equator, as, a, result, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, are, equally, illuminated, for, the, same, reason, this, is, also, the, time, when, the, sun, rises, for, an, observer, at, one, of, earth, s, rotational, poles, and, sets, at, the, other, for, a, brief, period, lasting, approximately, four, days, both, north, and, south, poles, are, in, daylight, for, example, in, 2021, sunrise, on, the, north, pole, is, 18, march, 07, 09, utc, and, sunset, on, the, south, pole, is, 22, march, 13, 08, utc, also, in, 2021, sunrise, on, the, south, pole, is, 20, september, 16, 08, utc, and, sunset, on, the, north, pole, is, 24, september, 22, 30, utc, in, other, words, the, equinoxes, are, the, only, times, when, the, subsolar, point, is, on, the, equator, meaning, that, the, sun, is, exactly, overhead, at, a, point, on, the, equatorial, line, the, subsolar, point, crosses, the, equator, moving, northward, at, the, march, equinox, and, southward, at, the, september, equinox, when, julius, caesar, established, the, julian, calendar, in, 45, bc, he, set, 25, march, as, the, date, of, the, spring, equinox, this, was, already, the, starting, day, of, the, year, in, the, persian, and, indian, calendars, because, the, julian, year, is, longer, than, the, tropical, year, by, about, 11, 3, minutes, on, average, or, 1, day, in, 128, years, the, calendar, drifted, with, respect, to, the, two, equinoxes, so, that, in, 300, ad, the, spring, equinox, occurred, on, about, 21, march, and, by, the, 1580s, ad, it, had, drifted, backwards, to, 11, march, this, drift, induced, pope, gregory, xiii, to, establish, the, modern, gregorian, calendar, the, pope, wanted, to, continue, to, conform, with, the, edicts, of, the, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, ad, concerning, the, date, of, easter, which, means, he, wanted, to, move, the, vernal, equinox, to, the, date, on, which, it, fell, at, that, time, 21, march, is, the, day, allocated, to, it, in, the, easter, table, of, the, julian, calendar, and, to, maintain, it, at, around, that, date, in, the, future, which, he, achieved, by, reducing, the, number, of, leap, years, from, 100, to, 97, every, 400, years, however, there, remained, a, small, residual, variation, in, the, date, and, time, of, the, vernal, equinox, of, about, 27, hours, from, its, mean, position, virtually, all, because, the, distribution, of, 24, hour, centurial, leap, days, causes, large, jumps, see, gregorian, calendar, leap, solstice, the, dates, of, the, equinoxes, change, progressively, during, the, leap, year, cycle, because, the, gregorian, calendar, year, is, not, commensurate, with, the, period, of, the, earth, s, revolution, about, the, sun, it, is, only, after, a, complete, gregorian, leap, year, cycle, of, 400, years, that, the, seasons, commence, at, approximately, the, same, time, in, the, 21st, century, the, earliest, march, equinox, will, be, 19, march, 2096, while, the, latest, was, 21, march, 2003, the, earliest, september, equinox, will, be, 21, september, 2096, while, the, latest, was, 23, september, 2003, universal, time, on, the, date, of, the, equinox, the, center, of, the, sun, spends, a, roughly, equal, amount, of, time, above, and, below, the, horizon, at, every, location, on, the, earth, so, night, and, day, are, about, the, same, length, sunrise, and, sunset, can, be, defined, in, several, ways, but, a, widespread, definition, is, the, time, that, the, top, limb, of, the, sun, is, level, with, the, horizon, with, this, definition, the, day, is, longer, than, the, night, at, the, equinoxes, in, sunrise, sunset, tables, the, atmospheric, refraction, is, assumed, to, be, 34, arcminutes, and, the, assumed, semidiameter, apparent, radius, of, the, sun, is, 16, arcminutes, the, apparent, radius, varies, slightly, depending, on, time, of, year, slightly, larger, at, perihelion, in, january, than, aphelion, in, july, but, the, difference, is, comparatively, small, their, combination, means, that, when, the, upper, limb, of, the, sun, is, on, the, visible, horizon, its, centre, is, 50, arcminutes, below, the, geometric, horizon, which, is, the, intersection, with, the, celestial, sphere, of, a, horizontal, plane, through, the, eye, of, the, observer, these, effects, make, the, day, about, 14, minutes, longer, than, the, night, at, the, equator, and, longer, still, towards, the, poles, the, real, equality, of, day, and, night, only, happens, in, places, far, enough, from, the, equator, to, have, a, seasonal, difference, in, day, length, of, at, least, 7, minutes, actually, occurring, a, few, days, towards, the, winter, side, of, each, equinox, one, result, of, this, is, that, at, latitudes, below, 2, 0, degrees, all, the, days, of, the, year, are, longer, than, the, nights, the, times, of, sunset, and, sunrise, vary, with, the, observer, s, location, longitude, and, latitude, so, the, dates, when, day, and, night, are, equal, also, depend, upon, the, observer, s, location, a, third, correction, for, the, visual, observation, of, a, sunrise, or, sunset, is, the, angle, between, the, apparent, horizon, as, seen, by, an, observer, and, the, geometric, or, sensible, horizon, this, is, known, as, the, dip, of, the, horizon, and, varies, from, 3, arcminutes, for, a, viewer, standing, on, the, sea, shore, to, 160, arcminutes, for, a, mountaineer, on, everest, the, effect, of, a, larger, dip, on, taller, objects, reaching, over, 2, of, arc, on, everest, accounts, for, the, phenomenon, of, snow, on, a, mountain, peak, turning, gold, in, the, sunlight, long, before, the, lower, slopes, are, illuminated, the, date, on, which, the, day, and, night, are, exactly, the, same, is, known, as, an, equilux, the, neologism, believed, to, have, been, coined, in, the, 1980s, achieved, more, widespread, recognition, in, the, 21st, century, at, the, most, precise, measurements, a, true, equilux, is, rare, because, the, lengths, of, day, and, night, change, more, rapidly, than, any, other, time, of, the, year, around, the, equinoxes, in, the, mid, latitudes, daylight, increases, or, decreases, by, about, three, minutes, per, day, at, the, equinoxes, and, thus, adjacent, days, and, nights, only, reach, within, one, minute, of, each, other, the, date, of, the, closest, approximation, of, the, equilux, varies, slightly, by, latitude, in, the, mid, latitudes, it, occurs, a, few, days, before, the, spring, equinox, and, after, the, fall, equinox, in, each, respective, hemisphere, mirror, image, conjugate, auroras, have, been, observed, during, the, equinoxes, the, equinoxes, are, sometimes, regarded, as, the, start, of, spring, and, autumn, a, number, of, traditional, harvest, festivals, are, celebrated, on, the, date, of, the, equinoxes, people, in, countries, including, iran, afghanistan, tajikistan, celebrate, nowruz, which, is, spring, equinox, in, northern, hemisphere, this, day, marks, the, new, year, in, solar, hijri, calendar, religious, architecture, is, often, determined, by, the, equinox, the, angkor, wat, equinox, during, which, the, sun, rises, in, a, perfect, alignment, over, angkor, wat, in, cambodia, is, one, such, example, catholic, churches, since, the, recommendations, of, charles, borromeo, have, often, chosen, the, equinox, as, their, reference, point, for, the, orientation, of, churches, vishu, from, sanskrit, vi, uvam, literally, means, equal, and, it, connoted, to, the, celebration, of, spring, equinox, in, the, past, the, spring, equinox, however, occurs, 24, days, before, the, day, of, vishu, on, 21, march, meenam, 7, due, to, precession, of, equinoxes, one, effect, of, equinoctial, periods, is, the, temporary, disruption, of, communications, satellites, for, all, geostationary, satellites, there, are, a, few, days, around, the, equinox, when, the, sun, goes, directly, behind, the, satellite, relative, to, earth, i, e, within, the, beam, width, of, the, ground, station, antenna, for, a, short, period, each, day, the, sun, s, immense, power, and, broad, radiation, spectrum, overload, the, earth, station, s, reception, circuits, with, noise, and, depending, on, antenna, size, and, other, factors, temporarily, disrupt, or, degrade, the, circuit, the, duration, of, those, effects, varies, but, can, range, from, a, few, minutes, to, an, hour, for, a, given, frequency, band, a, larger, antenna, has, a, narrower, beam, width, and, hence, experiences, shorter, duration, sun, outage, windows, satellites, in, geostationary, orbit, also, experience, difficulties, maintaining, power, during, the, equinox, because, they, have, to, travel, through, earth, s, shadow, and, rely, only, on, battery, power, usually, a, satellite, travels, either, north, or, south, of, the, earth, s, shadow, because, earth, s, axis, is, not, directly, perpendicular, to, a, line, from, the, earth, to, the, sun, at, other, times, during, the, equinox, since, geostationary, satellites, are, situated, above, the, equator, they, are, in, earth, s, shadow, for, the, longest, duration, all, year, equinoxes, are, defined, on, any, planet, with, a, tilted, rotational, axis, a, dramatic, example, is, saturn, where, the, equinox, places, its, ring, system, edge, on, facing, the, sun, as, a, result, they, are, visible, only, as, a, thin, line, when, seen, from, earth, when, seen, from, above, a, view, seen, during, an, equinox, for, the, first, time, from, the, cassini, space, probe, in, 2009, they, receive, very, little, sunshine, indeed, they, receive, more, planetshine, than, light, from, the, sun, this, phenomenon, occurs, once, every, 14, 7, years, on, average, and, can, last, a, few, weeks, before, and, after, the, exact, equinox, saturn, s, most, recent, equinox, was, on, 11, august, 2009, and, its, next, will, take, place, on, 6, may, 2025, mars, s, most, recent, equinoxes, were, on, 12, january, 2024, northern, autumn, and, on, 26, december, 2022, northern, spring
