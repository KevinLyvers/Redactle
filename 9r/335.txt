the, lanthanide, l, n, n, a, d, or, lanthanoid, l, n, n, d, series, of, chemical, elements, comprises, at, least, the, 14, metallic, chemical, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 57, 70, from, lanthanum, through, ytterbium, in, the, periodic, table, they, fill, the, 4f, orbitals, lutetium, element, 71, is, also, sometimes, considered, a, lanthanide, despite, being, a, d, block, element, and, a, transition, metal, the, informal, chemical, symbol, ln, is, used, in, general, discussions, of, lanthanide, chemistry, to, refer, to, any, lanthanide, all, but, one, of, the, lanthanides, are, f, block, elements, corresponding, to, the, filling, of, the, 4f, electron, shell, lutetium, is, a, d, block, element, thus, also, a, transition, metal, and, on, this, basis, its, inclusion, has, been, questioned, however, like, its, congeners, scandium, and, yttrium, in, group, 3, it, behaves, similarly, to, the, other, 14, the, term, rare, earth, element, or, rare, earth, metal, is, often, used, to, include, the, stable, group, 3, elements, sc, y, and, lu, in, addition, to, the, 4f, elements, all, lanthanide, elements, form, trivalent, cations, ln, 3, whose, chemistry, is, largely, determined, by, the, ionic, radius, which, decreases, steadily, from, lanthanum, la, to, lutetium, lu, these, elements, are, called, lanthanides, because, the, elements, in, the, series, are, chemically, similar, to, lanthanum, because, lanthanide, means, like, lanthanum, it, has, been, argued, that, lanthanum, cannot, logically, be, a, lanthanide, but, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, acknowledges, its, inclusion, based, on, common, usage, in, presentations, of, the, periodic, table, the, f, block, elements, are, customarily, shown, as, two, additional, rows, below, the, main, body, of, the, table, this, convention, is, entirely, a, matter, of, aesthetics, and, formatting, practicality, a, rarely, used, wide, formatted, periodic, table, inserts, the, 4f, and, 5f, series, in, their, proper, places, as, parts, of, the, table, s, sixth, and, seventh, rows, periods, respectively, the, 1985, iupac, red, book, p, 45, recommends, using, lanthanoid, instead, of, lanthanide, as, the, ending, ide, normally, indicates, a, negative, ion, however, owing, to, widespread, current, use, lanthanide, is, still, allowed, primordial, from, decay, synthetic, border, shows, natural, occurrence, of, the, element, the, term, lanthanide, was, introduced, by, victor, goldschmidt, in, 1925, despite, their, abundance, the, technical, term, lanthanides, is, interpreted, to, reflect, a, sense, of, elusiveness, on, the, part, of, these, elements, as, it, comes, from, the, greek, lanthanein, to, lie, hidden, rather, than, referring, to, their, natural, abundance, the, word, reflects, their, property, of, hiding, behind, each, other, in, minerals, the, term, derives, from, lanthanum, first, discovered, in, 1838, at, that, time, a, so, called, new, rare, earth, element, lying, hidden, or, escaping, notice, in, a, cerium, mineral, and, it, is, an, irony, that, lanthanum, was, later, identified, as, the, first, in, an, entire, series, of, chemically, similar, elements, and, gave, its, name, to, the, whole, series, together, with, the, stable, elements, of, group, 3, scandium, yttrium, and, lutetium, the, trivial, name, rare, earths, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, the, set, of, lanthanides, the, earth, in, the, name, rare, earths, arises, from, the, minerals, from, which, they, were, isolated, which, were, uncommon, oxide, type, minerals, however, these, elements, are, neither, rare, in, abundance, nor, earths, an, obsolete, term, for, water, insoluble, strongly, basic, oxides, of, electropositive, metals, incapable, of, being, smelted, into, metal, using, late, 18th, century, technology, group, 2, is, known, as, the, alkaline, earth, elements, for, much, the, same, reason, the, rare, in, the, name, rare, earths, has, more, to, do, with, the, difficulty, of, separating, of, the, individual, elements, than, the, scarcity, of, any, of, them, by, way, of, the, greek, dysprositos, for, hard, to, get, at, element, 66, dysprosium, was, similarly, named, the, elements, 57, la, to, 71, lu, are, very, similar, chemically, to, one, another, and, frequently, occur, together, in, nature, often, a, mixture, of, three, to, all, 15, of, the, lanthanides, along, with, yttrium, as, a, 16th, occur, in, minerals, such, as, monazite, and, samarskite, for, which, samarium, is, named, these, minerals, can, also, contain, group, 3, elements, and, actinides, such, as, uranium, and, thorium, a, majority, of, the, rare, earths, were, discovered, at, the, same, mine, in, ytterby, sweden, and, four, of, them, are, named, yttrium, ytterbium, erbium, terbium, after, the, village, and, a, fifth, holmium, after, stockholm, scandium, is, named, after, scandinavia, thulium, after, the, old, name, thule, and, the, immediately, following, group, 4, element, number, 72, hafnium, is, named, for, the, latin, name, of, the, city, of, copenhagen, the, properties, of, the, lanthanides, arise, from, the, order, in, which, the, electron, shells, of, these, elements, are, filled, the, outermost, 6s, has, the, same, configuration, for, all, of, them, and, a, deeper, 4f, shell, is, progressively, filled, with, electrons, as, the, atomic, number, increases, from, 57, towards, 71, for, many, years, mixtures, of, more, than, one, rare, earth, were, considered, to, be, single, elements, such, as, neodymium, and, praseodymium, being, thought, to, be, the, single, element, didymium, very, small, differences, in, solubility, are, used, in, solvent, and, ion, exchange, purification, methods, for, these, elements, which, require, repeated, application, to, obtain, a, purified, metal, the, diverse, applications, of, refined, metals, and, their, compounds, can, be, attributed, to, the, subtle, and, pronounced, variations, in, their, electronic, electrical, optical, and, magnetic, properties, by, way, of, example, of, the, term, meaning, hidden, rather, than, scarce, cerium, is, almost, as, abundant, as, copper, on, the, other, hand, promethium, with, no, stable, or, long, lived, isotopes, is, truly, rare, between, initial, xe, and, final, 6s, 2, electronic, shells, sm, has, a, close, packed, structure, like, most, of, the, lanthanides, but, has, an, unusual, 9, layer, repeat, gschneider, and, daane, 1988, attribute, the, trend, in, melting, point, which, increases, across, the, series, lanthanum, 920, c, lutetium, 1622, c, to, the, extent, of, hybridization, of, the, 6s, 5d, and, 4f, orbitals, the, hybridization, is, believed, to, be, at, its, greatest, for, cerium, which, has, the, lowest, melting, point, of, all, 795, c, the, lanthanide, metals, are, soft, their, hardness, increases, across, the, series, europium, stands, out, as, it, has, the, lowest, density, in, the, series, at, 5, 24, g, cm, 3, and, the, largest, metallic, radius, in, the, series, at, 208, 4, pm, it, can, be, compared, to, barium, which, has, a, metallic, radius, of, 222, pm, it, is, believed, that, the, metal, contains, the, larger, eu, 2, ion, and, that, there, are, only, two, electrons, in, the, conduction, band, ytterbium, also, has, a, large, metallic, radius, and, a, similar, explanation, is, suggested, the, resistivities, of, the, lanthanide, metals, are, relatively, high, ranging, from, 29, to, 134, cm, these, values, can, be, compared, to, a, good, conductor, such, as, aluminium, which, has, a, resistivity, of, 2, 655, cm, with, the, exceptions, of, la, yb, and, lu, which, have, no, unpaired, f, electrons, the, lanthanides, are, strongly, paramagnetic, and, this, is, reflected, in, their, magnetic, susceptibilities, gadolinium, becomes, ferromagnetic, at, below, 16, c, curie, point, the, other, heavier, lanthanides, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, and, ytterbium, become, ferromagnetic, at, much, lower, temperatures, 4f, 14, not, including, initial, core, f, f, transitions, are, symmetry, forbidden, or, laporte, forbidden, which, is, also, true, of, transition, metals, however, transition, metals, are, able, to, use, vibronic, coupling, to, break, this, rule, the, valence, orbitals, in, lanthanides, are, almost, entirely, non, bonding, and, as, such, little, effective, vibronic, coupling, takes, hence, the, spectra, from, f, f, transitions, are, much, weaker, and, narrower, than, those, from, d, d, transitions, in, general, this, makes, the, colors, of, lanthanide, complexes, far, fainter, than, those, of, transition, metal, complexes, viewing, the, lanthanides, from, left, to, right, in, the, periodic, table, the, seven, 4f, atomic, orbitals, become, progressively, more, filled, see, above, and, periodic, table, electron, configuration, table, the, electronic, configuration, of, most, neutral, gas, phase, lanthanide, atoms, is, 6s, 2, 4f, n, where, n, is, 56, less, than, the, atomic, number, z, exceptions, are, la, ce, gd, and, lu, which, have, 4f, n, 1, 5d, 1, though, even, then, 4f, n, is, a, low, lying, excited, state, for, la, ce, and, gd, for, lu, the, 4f, shell, is, already, full, and, the, fifteenth, electron, has, no, choice, but, to, enter, 5d, with, the, exception, of, lutetium, the, 4f, orbitals, are, chemically, active, in, all, lanthanides, and, produce, profound, differences, between, lanthanide, chemistry, and, transition, metal, chemistry, the, 4f, orbitals, penetrate, the, core, and, are, isolated, and, thus, they, do, not, participate, much, in, bonding, this, explains, why, crystal, field, effects, are, small, and, why, they, do, not, form, bonds, as, there, are, seven, 4f, orbitals, the, number, of, unpaired, electrons, can, be, as, high, as, 7, which, gives, rise, to, the, large, magnetic, moments, observed, for, lanthanide, compounds, measuring, the, magnetic, moment, can, be, used, to, investigate, the, 4f, electron, configuration, and, this, is, a, useful, tool, in, providing, an, insight, into, the, chemical, bonding, the, lanthanide, contraction, i, e, the, reduction, in, size, of, the, ln, 3, ion, from, la, 3, 103, pm, to, lu, 3, 86, 1, pm, is, often, explained, by, the, poor, shielding, of, the, 5s, and, 5p, electrons, by, the, 4f, electrons, the, chemistry, of, the, lanthanides, is, dominated, by, the, 3, oxidation, state, and, in, ln, iii, compounds, the, 6s, electrons, and, usually, one, 4f, electron, are, lost, and, the, ions, have, the, configuration, 4f, n, 1, all, the, lanthanide, elements, exhibit, the, oxidation, state, 3, in, addition, ce, 3, can, lose, its, single, f, electron, to, form, ce, 4, with, the, stable, electronic, configuration, of, xenon, also, eu, 3, can, gain, an, electron, to, form, eu, 2, with, the, f, 7, configuration, that, has, the, extra, stability, of, a, half, filled, shell, other, than, ce, iv, and, eu, ii, none, of, the, lanthanides, are, stable, in, oxidation, states, other, than, 3, in, aqueous, solution, in, terms, of, reduction, potentials, the, ln, 0, 3, couples, are, nearly, the, same, for, all, lanthanides, ranging, from, 1, 99, for, eu, to, 2, 35, v, for, pr, thus, these, metals, are, highly, reducing, with, reducing, power, similar, to, alkaline, earth, metals, such, as, mg, 2, 36, v, the, ionization, energies, for, the, lanthanides, can, be, compared, with, aluminium, in, aluminium, the, sum, of, the, first, three, ionization, energies, is, 5139, kj, mol, 1, whereas, the, lanthanides, fall, in, the, range, 3455, 4186, kj, mol, 1, this, correlates, with, the, highly, reactive, nature, of, the, lanthanides, the, sum, of, the, first, two, ionization, energies, for, europium, 1632, kj, mol, 1, can, be, compared, with, that, of, barium, 1468, 1, kj, mol, 1, and, europium, s, third, ionization, energy, is, the, highest, of, the, lanthanides, the, sum, of, the, first, two, ionization, energies, for, ytterbium, are, the, second, lowest, in, the, series, and, its, third, ionization, energy, is, the, second, highest, the, high, third, ionization, energy, for, eu, and, yb, correlate, with, the, half, filling, 4f, 7, and, complete, filling, 4f, 14, of, the, 4f, subshell, and, the, stability, afforded, by, such, configurations, due, to, exchange, energy, europium, and, ytterbium, form, salt, like, compounds, with, eu, 2, and, yb, 2, for, example, the, salt, like, dihydrides, both, europium, and, ytterbium, dissolve, in, liquid, ammonia, forming, solutions, of, ln, 2, nh, 3, x, again, demonstrating, their, similarities, to, the, alkaline, earth, metals, the, relative, ease, with, which, the, 4th, electron, can, be, removed, in, cerium, and, to, a, lesser, extent, praseodymium, indicates, why, ce, iv, and, pr, iv, compounds, can, be, formed, for, example, ceo, 2, is, formed, rather, than, ce, 2, o, 3, when, cerium, reacts, with, oxygen, also, tb, has, a, well, known, iv, state, as, removing, the, 4th, electron, in, this, case, produces, a, half, full, 4f, 7, configuration, the, additional, stable, valences, for, ce, and, eu, mean, that, their, abundances, in, rocks, sometimes, varies, significantly, relative, to, the, other, rare, earth, elements, see, cerium, anomaly, and, europium, anomaly, the, similarity, in, ionic, radius, between, adjacent, lanthanide, elements, makes, it, difficult, to, separate, them, from, each, other, in, naturally, occurring, ores, and, other, mixtures, historically, the, very, laborious, processes, of, cascading, and, fractional, crystallization, were, used, because, the, lanthanide, ions, have, slightly, different, radii, the, lattice, energy, of, their, salts, and, hydration, energies, of, the, ions, will, be, slightly, different, leading, to, a, small, difference, in, solubility, salts, of, the, formula, ln, no, 3, 3, 2nh, 4, no, 3, 4h, 2, o, can, be, used, industrially, the, elements, are, separated, from, each, other, by, solvent, extraction, typically, an, aqueous, solution, of, nitrates, is, extracted, into, kerosene, containing, tri, n, butylphosphate, the, strength, of, the, complexes, formed, increases, as, the, ionic, radius, decreases, so, solubility, in, the, organic, phase, increases, complete, separation, can, be, achieved, continuously, by, use, of, countercurrent, exchange, methods, the, elements, can, also, be, separated, by, ion, exchange, chromatography, making, use, of, the, fact, that, the, stability, constant, for, formation, of, edta, complexes, increases, for, log, k, 15, 5, for, to, log, k, 19, 8, for, when, in, the, form, of, coordination, complexes, lanthanides, exist, overwhelmingly, in, their, 3, oxidation, state, although, particularly, stable, 4f, configurations, can, also, give, 4, ce, tb, or, 2, eu, yb, ions, all, of, these, forms, are, strongly, electropositive, and, thus, lanthanide, ions, are, hard, lewis, acids, the, oxidation, states, are, also, very, stable, with, the, exceptions, of, smi, 2, and, cerium, iv, salts, lanthanides, are, not, used, for, redox, chemistry, 4f, electrons, have, a, high, probability, of, being, found, close, to, the, nucleus, and, are, thus, strongly, affected, as, the, nuclear, charge, increases, across, the, series, this, results, in, a, corresponding, decrease, in, ionic, radii, referred, to, as, the, lanthanide, contraction, the, low, probability, of, the, 4f, electrons, existing, at, the, outer, region, of, the, atom, or, ion, permits, little, effective, overlap, between, the, orbitals, of, a, lanthanide, ion, and, any, binding, ligand, thus, lanthanide, complexes, typically, have, little, or, no, covalent, character, and, are, not, influenced, by, orbital, geometries, the, lack, of, orbital, interaction, also, means, that, varying, the, metal, typically, has, little, effect, on, the, complex, other, than, size, especially, when, compared, to, transition, metals, complexes, are, held, together, by, weaker, electrostatic, forces, which, are, omni, directional, and, thus, the, ligands, alone, dictate, the, symmetry, and, coordination, of, complexes, steric, factors, therefore, dominate, with, coordinative, saturation, of, the, metal, being, balanced, against, inter, ligand, repulsion, this, results, in, a, diverse, range, of, coordination, geometries, many, of, which, are, irregular, and, also, manifests, itself, in, the, highly, fluxional, nature, of, the, complexes, as, there, is, no, energetic, reason, to, be, locked, into, a, single, geometry, rapid, intramolecular, and, intermolecular, ligand, exchange, will, take, place, this, typically, results, in, complexes, that, rapidly, fluctuate, between, all, possible, configurations, many, of, these, features, make, lanthanide, complexes, effective, catalysts, hard, lewis, acids, are, able, to, polarise, bonds, upon, coordination, and, thus, alter, the, electrophilicity, of, compounds, with, a, classic, example, being, the, luche, reduction, the, large, size, of, the, ions, coupled, with, their, labile, ionic, bonding, allows, even, bulky, coordinating, species, to, bind, and, dissociate, rapidly, resulting, in, very, high, turnover, rates, thus, excellent, yields, can, often, be, achieved, with, loadings, of, only, a, few, mol, the, lack, of, orbital, interactions, combined, with, the, lanthanide, contraction, means, that, the, lanthanides, change, in, size, across, the, series, but, that, their, chemistry, remains, much, the, same, this, allows, for, easy, tuning, of, the, steric, environments, and, examples, exist, where, this, has, been, used, to, improve, the, catalytic, activity, of, the, complex, and, change, the, nuclearity, of, metal, clusters, despite, this, the, use, of, lanthanide, coordination, complexes, as, homogeneous, catalysts, is, largely, restricted, to, the, laboratory, and, there, are, currently, few, examples, them, being, used, on, an, industrial, scale, lanthanides, exist, in, many, forms, other, than, coordination, complexes, and, many, of, these, are, industrially, useful, in, particular, lanthanide, metal, oxides, are, used, as, heterogeneous, catalysts, in, various, industrial, processes, the, trivalent, lanthanides, mostly, form, ionic, salts, the, trivalent, ions, are, hard, acceptors, and, form, more, stable, complexes, with, oxygen, donor, ligands, than, with, nitrogen, donor, ligands, the, larger, ions, are, 9, coordinate, in, aqueous, solution, 3, but, the, smaller, ions, are, 8, coordinate, 3, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, later, lanthanides, have, more, water, molecules, in, the, second, coordination, sphere, complexation, with, monodentate, ligands, is, generally, weak, because, it, is, difficult, to, displace, water, molecules, from, the, first, coordination, sphere, stronger, complexes, are, formed, with, chelating, ligands, because, of, the, chelate, effect, such, as, the, tetra, anion, derived, from, 1, 4, 7, 10, tetraazacyclododecane, 1, 4, 7, 10, tetraacetic, acid, dota, the, most, common, divalent, derivatives, of, the, lanthanides, are, for, eu, ii, which, achieves, a, favorable, f, 7, configuration, divalent, halide, derivatives, are, known, for, all, of, the, lanthanides, they, are, either, conventional, salts, or, are, ln, iii, electride, like, salts, the, simple, salts, include, ybi, 2, eui, 2, and, smi, 2, the, electride, like, salts, described, as, ln, 3, 2i, e, include, lai, 2, cei, 2, and, gdi, 2, many, of, the, iodides, form, soluble, complexes, with, ethers, e, g, tmi, 2, dimethoxyethane, 3, samarium, ii, iodide, is, a, useful, reducing, agent, ln, ii, complexes, can, be, synthesized, by, transmetalation, reactions, the, normal, range, of, oxidation, states, can, be, expanded, via, the, use, of, sterically, bulky, cyclopentadienyl, ligands, in, this, way, many, lanthanides, can, be, isolated, as, ln, ii, compounds, ce, iv, in, ceric, ammonium, nitrate, is, a, useful, oxidizing, agent, the, ce, iv, is, the, exception, owing, to, the, tendency, to, form, an, unfilled, f, shell, otherwise, tetravalent, lanthanides, are, rare, however, recently, tb, iv, and, pr, iv, complexes, have, been, shown, to, exist, lanthanide, metals, react, exothermically, with, hydrogen, to, form, lnh, 2, dihydrides, with, the, exception, of, eu, and, yb, which, resemble, the, ba, and, ca, hydrides, non, conducting, transparent, salt, like, compounds, they, form, black, pyrophoric, conducting, compounds, where, the, metal, sub, lattice, is, face, centred, cubic, and, the, h, atoms, occupy, tetrahedral, sites, further, hydrogenation, produces, a, trihydride, which, is, non, stoichiometric, non, conducting, more, salt, like, the, formation, of, trihydride, is, associated, with, and, increase, in, 8, 10, volume, and, this, is, linked, to, greater, localization, of, charge, on, the, hydrogen, atoms, which, become, more, anionic, h, hydride, anion, in, character, the, only, tetrahalides, known, are, the, tetrafluorides, of, cerium, praseodymium, terbium, neodymium, and, dysprosium, the, last, two, known, only, under, matrix, isolation, conditions, all, of, the, lanthanides, form, trihalides, with, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, they, are, all, high, melting, and, predominantly, ionic, in, nature, the, fluorides, are, only, slightly, soluble, in, water, and, are, not, sensitive, to, air, and, this, contrasts, with, the, other, halides, which, are, air, sensitive, readily, soluble, in, water, and, react, at, high, temperature, to, form, oxohalides, the, trihalides, were, important, as, pure, metal, can, be, prepared, from, them, in, the, gas, phase, the, trihalides, are, planar, or, approximately, planar, the, lighter, lanthanides, have, a, lower, of, dimers, the, heavier, lanthanides, a, higher, proportion, the, dimers, have, a, similar, structure, to, al, 2, cl, 6, some, of, the, dihalides, are, conducting, while, the, rest, are, insulators, the, conducting, forms, can, be, considered, as, ln, iii, electride, compounds, where, the, electron, is, delocalised, into, a, conduction, band, ln, 3, x, 2, e, all, of, the, diiodides, have, relatively, short, metal, metal, separations, the, cuti, 2, structure, of, the, lanthanum, cerium, and, praseodymium, diiodides, along, with, hp, ndi, 2, contain, 4, 4, nets, of, metal, and, iodine, atoms, with, short, metal, metal, bonds, 393, 386, la, pr, these, compounds, should, be, considered, to, be, two, dimensional, metals, two, dimensional, in, the, same, way, that, graphite, is, the, salt, like, dihalides, include, those, of, eu, dy, tm, and, yb, the, formation, of, a, relatively, stable, 2, oxidation, state, for, eu, and, yb, is, usually, explained, by, the, stability, exchange, energy, of, half, filled, f, 7, and, fully, filled, f, 14, gdi, 2, possesses, the, layered, mos, 2, structure, is, ferromagnetic, and, exhibits, colossal, magnetoresistance, the, sesquihalides, ln, 2, x, 3, and, the, ln, 7, i, 12, compounds, listed, in, the, table, contain, metal, clusters, discrete, ln, 6, i, 12, clusters, in, ln, 7, i, 12, and, condensed, clusters, forming, chains, in, the, sesquihalides, scandium, forms, a, similar, cluster, compound, with, chlorine, sc, 7, cl, 12, unlike, many, transition, metal, clusters, these, lanthanide, clusters, do, not, have, strong, metal, metal, interactions, and, this, is, due, to, the, low, number, of, valence, electrons, involved, but, instead, are, stabilised, by, the, surrounding, halogen, atoms, lai, and, tmi, are, the, only, known, monohalides, lai, prepared, from, the, reaction, of, lai, 3, and, la, metal, it, has, a, nias, type, structure, and, can, be, formulated, la, 3, i, e, 2, tmi, is, a, true, tm, i, compound, however, it, is, not, isolated, in, a, pure, state, all, of, the, lanthanides, form, sesquioxides, ln, 2, o, 3, the, lighter, larger, lanthanides, adopt, a, hexagonal, 7, coordinate, structure, while, the, heavier, smaller, ones, adopt, a, cubic, 6, coordinate, c, m, 2, o, 3, structure, all, of, the, sesquioxides, are, basic, and, absorb, water, and, carbon, dioxide, from, air, to, form, carbonates, hydroxides, and, hydroxycarbonates, they, dissolve, in, acids, to, form, salts, cerium, forms,

lanthanide, compounds, exhibit, carbanion, like, behavior, unlike, the, behavior, in, transition, metal, organometallic, compounds, because, of, their, large, size, lanthanides, tend, to, form, more,

in, mri, scans, crystal, field, splitting, is, rather, small, for, the, lanthanide, ions, and, is, less, important, than, spin, orbit, coupling, in, regard, to, energy, levels, transitions, of, electrons, between, f, orbitals, are, forbidden, by, the, laporte, rule, furthermore, because, of, the, buried, nature, of, the, f, orbitals, coupling, with, molecular, vibrations, is, weak, consequently, the, spectra, of, lanthanide, ions, are, rather, weak, and, the, absorption, bands, are, similarly, narrow, glass, containing, holmium, oxide, and, holmium, oxide, solutions, usually, in, perchloric, acid, have, sharp, optical, absorption, peaks, in, the, spectral, range, 200, 900, nm, and, can, be, used, as, a, wavelength, calibration, standard, for, optical, spectrophotometers, and, are, available, commercially, as, f, f, transitions, are, laporte, forbidden, once, an, electron, has, been, excited, decay, to, the, ground, state, will, be, slow, this, makes, them, suitable, for, use, in, lasers, as, it, makes, the, population, inversion, easy, to, achieve, the, nd, yag, laser, is, one, that, is, widely, used, europium, doped, yttrium, vanadate, was, the, first, red,

earth, but, may, occur, in, lunar, soil, very, rare, halides, of, cerium, lanthanum, and, presumably, other, lanthanides, feldspars, and, garnets, are, also, known, to, exist, the, lanthanide, contraction, is, responsible, for, the, great, geochemical, divide, that, splits, the, lanthanides, into, light, and, heavy, lanthanide, enriched, minerals, the, latter, being, almost, inevitably, associated, with, and, dominated, by, yttrium, this, divide, is, reflected, in, the, first, two, rare, earths, that, were, discovered, yttria, 1794, and, ceria, 1803, the, geochemical, divide, has, put, more, of, the, light, lanthanides, in, the, earth, s, crust, but, more, of, the, heavy, members, in, the, earth, s, mantle, the, result, is, that, although, large, rich, ore, bodies, are, found, that, are, enriched, in, the, light, lanthanides, correspondingly, large, ore, bodies, for, the, heavy, members, are, few, the, principal, ores, are, monazite, and, bastn, site, monazite, sands, usually, contain, all, the, lanthanide, elements, but, the, heavier, elements, are, lacking, in, bastn, site, the, lanthanides, obey, the, oddo, harkins, rule, odd, numbered, elements, are, less, abundant, than, their, even, numbered, neighbors, three, of, the, lanthanide, elements, have, radioactive, isotopes, with, long, half, lives, 138, la, 147, sm, and, 176, lu, that, can, be, used, to, date, minerals, and, rocks, from, earth, the, moon, and, meteorites, promethium, is, effectively, a, man, made, element, as, all, its, isotopes, are, radioactive, with, half, lives, shorter, than, 20, years, lanthanide, elements, and, their, compounds, have, many, uses, but, the, quantities, consumed, are, relatively, small, in, comparison, to, other, elements, about, 15000, ton, year, of, the, lanthanides, are, consumed, as, catalysts, and, in, the, production, of, glasses, this, 15000, tons, corresponds, to, about, 85, of, the, lanthanide, production, from, the, perspective, of, value, however, applications, in, phosphors, and, magnets, are, more, important, the, devices, lanthanide, elements, are, used, in, include, superconductors, samarium, cobalt, and, neodymium, iron, boron, high, flux, rare, earth, magnets, magnesium, alloys, electronic, polishers, refining, catalysts, and, hybrid, car, components, primarily, batteries, and, magnets, lanthanide, ions, are, used, as, the, active, ions, in, luminescent, materials, used, in, optoelectronics, applications, most, notably, the, nd, yag, laser, erbium, doped, fiber, amplifiers, are, significant, devices, in, optical, fiber, communication, systems, phosphors, with, lanthanide, dopants, are, also, widely, used, in, cathode, ray, tube, technology, such, as, television, sets, the, earliest, color, television, crts, had, a, poor, quality, red, europium, as, a, phosphor, dopant, made, good, red, phosphors, possible, yttrium, iron, garnet, yig, spheres, can, act, as, tunable, microwave, resonators, lanthanide, oxides, are, mixed, with, tungsten, to, improve, their, high, temperature, properties, for, tig, welding, replacing, thorium, which, was, mildly, hazardous, to, work, with, many, defense, related, products, also, use, lanthanide, elements, such, as, night, vision, goggles, and, rangefinders, the, spy, 1, radar, used, in, some, aegis, equipped, warships, and, the, hybrid, propulsion, system, of, arleigh, burke, class, destroyers, all, use, rare, earth, magnets, in, critical, capacities, the, price, for, lanthanum, oxide, used, in, fluid, catalytic, cracking, has, risen, from, 5, per, kilogram, in, early, 2010, to, 140, per, kilogram, in, june, 2011, most, lanthanides, are, widely, used, in, lasers, and, as, co, dopants, in, doped, fiber, optical, amplifiers, for, example, in, er, doped, fiber, amplifiers, which, are, used, as, repeaters, in, the, terrestrial, and, submarine, fiber, optic, transmission, links, that, carry, internet, traffic, these, elements, deflect, ultraviolet, and, infrared, radiation, and, are, commonly, used, in, the, production, of, sunglass, lenses, other, applications, are, summarized, in, the, following, table, the, complex, gd, dota, is, used, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, lanthanide, complexes, can, be, used, for, optical, imaging, applications, are, limited, by, the, lability, of, the, complexes, some, applications, depend, on, the, unique, luminescence, properties, of, lanthanide, chelates, or, cryptates, these, are, well, suited, for, this, application, due, to, their, large, stokes, shifts, and, extremely, long, emission, lifetimes, from, microseconds, to, milliseconds, compared, to, more, traditional, fluorophores, e, g, fluorescein, allophycocyanin, phycoerythrin, and, rhodamine, the, biological, fluids, or, serum, commonly, used, in, these, research, applications, contain, many, compounds, and, proteins, which, are, naturally, fluorescent, therefore, the, use, of, conventional, steady, state, fluorescence, measurement, presents, serious, limitations, in, assay, sensitivity, long, lived, fluorophores, such, as, lanthanides, combined, with, time, resolved, detection, a, delay, between, excitation, and,

the, resulting, assay, provides, an, increase, in, flexibility, reliability, and, sensitivity, in, addition, to, higher, throughput, and, fewer, false, positive, false, negative, results, this, method, involves, two, fluorophores, a, donor, and, an, acceptor, excitation, of, the, donor, fluorophore, in, this, case, the, lanthanide, ion, complex, by, an, energy, source, e, g, flash, lamp, or, laser, produces, an, energy, transfer, to, the, acceptor, fluorophore, if, they, are, within, a, given, proximity, to, each, other, known, as, the, f, rster, s, radius, the, acceptor, fluorophore, in,

the, cancerous, cells, and, is, dependent, on, iron, cancer, cells, have, much, higher, levels, of, transferrin, receptors, than, normal, cells, and, are, very, dependent, on, iron, for, their, proliferation, in, the, field, of, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, compounds, containing, gadolinium, are, utilized, extensively, the, photobiological, characteristics, anticancer, anti, leukemia, and, anti, hiv, activities, of, the, lanthanides, with, coumarin, and, its, related, compounds, are, demonstrated, by, the, biological, activities, of, the, complex, cerium, has, shown, results, as, an, anti, cancer, agent, due, to, its, similarities, in, structure, and, biochemistry, to, iron, cerium, may, bind, in, the, place, of, iron, on, to, the, transferrin, and, then, be, brought, into, the, cancer, cells, by, transferrin, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, the, cerium, binding, to, the, transferrin, in, place, of, the, iron, inhibits, the, transferrin, activity, in, the, cell, this, creates, a, toxic, environment, for, the, cancer, cells, and, causes, a, decrease, in, cell, growth, this, is, the, proposed, mechanism, for, cerium, s, effect, on, cancer, cells, though, the, real, mechanism, may, be, more, complex, in, how, cerium, inhibits, cancer, cell, proliferation, specifically, in, hela, cancer, cells, studied, in, vitro, cell, viability, was, decreased, after, 48, to, 72, hours, of, cerium, treatments, cells, treated, with, just, cerium, had, decreases, in, cell, viability, but, cells, treated, with, both, cerium, and, transferrin, had, more, significant, inhibition, for, cellular, activity, another, specific, element, that, has, been, tested, and, used, as, an, anti, cancer, agent, is, lanthanum, more, specifically, lanthanum, chloride, lacl, 3, the, lanthanum, ion, is, used, to, affect, the, levels, of, let, 7a, and, micrornas, mir, 34a, in, a, cell, throughout, the, cell, cycle, when, the, lanthanum, ion, was, introduced, to, the, cell, in, vivo, or, in, vitro, it, inhibited, the, rapid, growth, and, induced, apoptosis, of, the, cancer, cells, specifically, cervical, cancer, cells, this, effect, was, caused, by, the, regulation, of, the, let, 7a, and, micrornas, by, the, lanthanum, ions, the, mechanism, for, this, effect, is, still, unclear, but, it, is, possible, that, the, lanthanum, is, acting, in, a, similar, way, as, the, cerium, and, binding, to, a, ligand, necessary, for, cancer, cell, proliferation, in, the, field, of, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, compounds, containing, gadolinium, are, utilized, extensively, due, to, their, sparse, distribution, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, low, aqueous, solubility, the, lanthanides, have, a, low, availability, in, the, biosphere, and, for, a, long, time, were, not, known, to, naturally, form, part, of, any, biological, molecules, in, 2007, a, novel, methanol, dehydrogenase, that, strictly, uses, lanthanides, as, enzymatic, cofactors, was, discovered, in, a, bacterium, from, the, phylum, verrucomicrobiota, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, this, bacterium, was, found, to, survive, only, if, there, are, lanthanides, present, in, the, environment, compared, to, most, other, nondietary, elements, non, radioactive, lanthanides, are, classified, as, having, low, toxicity, the, same, nutritional, requirement, has, also, been, observed, in, methylorubrum, extorquens, and, methylobacterium, radiotolerans
