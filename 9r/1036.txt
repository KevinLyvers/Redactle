in, experimental, and, applied, particle, physics, nuclear, physics, and, nuclear, engineering, a, particle, detector, also, known, as, a, radiation, detector, is, a, device, used, to, detect, track, and, or, identify, ionizing, particles, such, as, those, produced, by, nuclear, decay, cosmic, radiation, or, reactions, in, a, particle, accelerator, detectors, can, measure, the, particle, energy, and, other, attributes, such, as, momentum, spin, charge, particle, type, in, addition, to, merely, registering, the, presence, of, the, particle, many, of, the, detectors, invented, and, used, so, far, are, ionization, detectors, of, which, gaseous, ionization, detectors, and, semiconductor, detectors, are, most, typical, and, scintillation, detectors, but, other, completely, different, principles, have, also, been, applied, like, erenkov, light, and, transition, radiation, historical, examples, the, following, types, of, particle, detector, are, widely, used, for, radiation, protection, and, are, commercially, produced, in, large, quantities, for, general, use, within, the, nuclear, medical, and, environmental, fields, commonly, used, detectors, for, particle, and, nuclear, physics, modern, detectors, in, particle, physics, combine, several, of, the, above, elements, in, layers, much, like, an, onion, detectors, designed, for, modern, accelerators, are, huge, both, in, size, and, in, cost, the, term, counter, is, often, used, instead, of, detector, when, the, detector, counts, the, particles, but, does, not, resolve, its, energy, or, ionization, particle, detectors, can, also, usually, track, ionizing, radiation, high, energy, photons, or, even, visible, light, if, their, main, purpose, is, radiation, measurement, they, are, called, radiation, detectors, but, as, photons, are, also, massless, particles, the, term, particle, detector, is, still, correct, beyond, their, experimental, implementations, theoretical, models, of, particle, detectors, are, also, of, great, importance, to, theoretical, physics, these, models, consider, localized, non, relativistic, quantum, systems, coupled, to, a, quantum, field, they, receive, the, name, of, particle, detectors, because, when, the, non, relativistic, quantum, system, is, measured, in, an, excited, state, one, can, claim, to, have, detected, a, particle, the, first, instance, of, particle, detector, models, in, the, literature, dates, from, the, 80, s, where, a, particle, in, a, box, was, introduced, by, w, g, unruh, in, order, to, probe, a, quantum, field, around, a, black, hole, shortly, after, bryce, dewitt, proposed, a, simplification, of, the, model, giving, rise, to, the, unruh, dewitt, detector, model, beyond, their, applications, to, theoretical, physics, particle, detector, models, are, related, to, experimental, fields, such, as, quantum, optics, where, atoms, can, be, used, as, detectors, for, the, quantum, electromagnetic, field, via, the, light, matter, interaction, from, a, conceptual, side, particle, detectors, also, allow, one, to, formally, define, the, concept, of, particles, without, relying, on, asymptotic, states, or, representations, of, a, quantum, field, theory, as, m, scully, puts, it, from, an, operational, viewpoint, one, can, state, that, a, particle, is, what, a, particle, detector, detects, which, in, essence, defines, a, particle, as, the, detection, of, excitations, of, a, quantum, field
