electric, potential, also, called, the, electric, field, potential, potential, drop, the, electrostatic, potential, is, defined, as, the, amount, of, work, energy, needed, per, unit, of, electric, charge, to, move, the, charge, from, a, reference, point, to, a, specific, point, in, an, electric, field, more, precisely, the, electric, potential, is, the, energy, per, unit, charge, for, a, test, charge, that, is, so, small, that, the, disturbance, of, the, field, under, consideration, is, negligible, the, motion, across, the, field, is, supposed, to, proceed, with, negligible, acceleration, so, as, to, avoid, the, test, charge, acquiring, kinetic, energy, or, producing, radiation, by, definition, the, electric, potential, at, the, reference, point, is, zero, units, typically, the, reference, point, is, earth, or, a, point, at, infinity, although, any, point, can, be, used, in, classical, electrostatics, the, electrostatic, field, is, a, vector, quantity, expressed, as, the, gradient, of, the, electrostatic, potential, which, is, a, scalar, quantity, denoted, by, v, or, occasionally, equal, to, the, electric, potential, energy, of, any, charged, particle, at, any, location, measured, in, joules, divided, by, the, charge, of, that, particle, measured, in, coulombs, by, dividing, out, the, charge, on, the, particle, a, quotient, is, obtained, that, is, a, property, of, the, electric, field, itself, in, short, an, electric, potential, is, the, electric, potential, energy, per, unit, charge, this, value, can, be, calculated, in, either, a, static, time, invariant, or, a, dynamic, time, varying, electric, field, at, a, specific, time, with, the, unit, joules, per, coulomb, j, c, 1, or, volt, v, the, electric, potential, at, infinity, is, assumed, to, be, zero, in, electrodynamics, when, time, varying, fields, are, present, the, electric, field, cannot, be, expressed, only, as, a, scalar, potential, instead, the, electric, field, can, be, expressed, as, both, the, scalar, electric, potential, and, the, magnetic, vector, potential, the, electric, potential, and, the, magnetic, vector, potential, together, form, a, four, vector, so, that, the, two, kinds, of, potential, are, mixed, under, lorentz, transformations, practically, the, electric, potential, is, a, continuous, function, in, all, space, because, a, spatial, derivative, of, a, discontinuous, electric, potential, yields, an, electric, field, of, impossibly, infinite, magnitude, notably, the, electric, potential, due, to, an, idealized, point, charge, proportional, to, 1, r, with, r, the, distance, from, the, point, charge, is, continuous, in, all, space, except, at, the, location, of, the, point, charge, though, electric, field, is, not, continuous, across, an, idealized, surface, charge, it, is, not, infinite, at, any, point, therefore, the, electric, potential, is, continuous, across, an, idealized, surface, charge, additionally, an, idealized, line, of, charge, has, electric, potential, proportional, to, ln, r, with, r, the, radial, distance, from, the, line, of, charge, is, continuous, everywhere, except, on, the, line, of, charge, classical, mechanics, explores, concepts, such, as, force, energy, and, potential, force, and, potential, energy, are, directly, related, a, net, force, acting, on, any, object, will, cause, it, to, accelerate, as, an, object, moves, in, the, direction, of, a, force, acting, on, it, its, potential, energy, decreases, for, example, the, gravitational, potential, energy, of, a, cannonball, at, the, top, of, a, hill, is, greater, than, at, the, base, of, the, hill, as, it, rolls, downhill, its, potential, energy, decreases, and, is, being, translated, to, motion, kinetic, energy, it, is, possible, to, define, the, potential, of, certain, force, fields, so, that, the, potential, energy, of, an, object, in, that, field, depends, only, on, the, position, of, the, object, with, respect, to, the, field, two, such, force, fields, are, a, gravitational, field, and, an, electric, field, in, the, absence, of, time, varying, magnetic, fields, such, fields, affect, objects, because, of, the, intrinsic, properties, e, g, mass, or, charge, and, positions, of, the, objects, an, object, may, possess, a, property, known, as, electric, charge, since, an, electric, field, exerts, force, on, a, charged, object, if, the, object, has, a, positive, charge, the, force, will, be, in, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, vector, at, the, location, of, the, charge, if, the, charge, is, negative, the, force, will, be, in, the, opposite, direction, the, magnitude, of, force, is, given, by, the, quantity, of, the, charge, multiplied, by, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, field, vector, f, q, e, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, mathbf, e, an, electric, potential, at, a, point, r, in, a, static, electric, field, e, is, given, by, the, line, integral, v, e, c, e, d, displaystyle, v, mathbf, e, int, mathcal, c, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, where, c, is, an, arbitrary, path, from, some, fixed, reference, point, to, r, it, is, uniquely, determined, up, to, a, constant, that, is, added, or, subtracted, from, the, integral, in, electrostatics, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, reveals, that, the, curl, e, textstyle, nabla, times, mathbf, e, is, zero, making, the, electric, field, conservative, thus, the, line, integral, above, does, not, depend, on, the, specific, path, c, chosen, but, only, on, its, endpoints, making, v, e, textstyle, v, mathbf, e, well, defined, everywhere, the, gradient, theorem, then, allows, us, to, write, e, v, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, nabla, v, mathbf, e, this, states, that, the, electric, field, points, downhill, towards, lower, voltages, by, gauss, s, law, the, potential, can, also, be, found, to, satisfy, poisson, s, equation, e, v, e, 2, v, e, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, nabla, cdot, mathbf, e, mathbf, nabla, cdot, left, mathbf, nabla, v, mathbf, e, right, nabla, 2, v, mathbf, e, rho, varepsilon, 0, where, is, the, total, charge, density, and, textstyle, mathbf, nabla, cdot, denotes, the, divergence, the, concept, of, electric, potential, is, closely, linked, with, potential, energy, a, test, charge, q, has, an, electric, potential, energy, u, e, given, by, u, e, q, v, displaystyle, u, mathbf, e, q, v, the, potential, energy, and, hence, also, the, electric, potential, is, only, defined, up, to, an, additive, constant, one, must, arbitrarily, choose, a, position, where, the, potential, energy, and, the, electric, potential, are, zero, these, equations, cannot, be, used, if, e, 0, textstyle, nabla, times, mathbf, e, neq, mathbf, 0, i, e, in, the, case, of, a, non, conservative, electric, field, caused, by, a, changing, magnetic, field, see, maxwell, s, equations, the, generalization, of, electric, potential, to, this, case, is, described, in, the, section, generalization, to, electrodynamics, the, electric, potential, arising, from, a, point, charge, q, at, a, distance, r, from, the, location, of, q, is, observed, to, be, v, e, 1, 4, 0, q, r, displaystyle, v, mathbf, e, frac, 1, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, frac, q, r, where, 0, is, the, permittivity, of, vacuum, v, e, is, known, as, the, coulomb, potential, note, that, in, contrast, to, the, magnitude, of, an, electric, field, due, to, a, point, charge, the, electric, potential, scales, respective, to, the, reciprocal, of, the, radius, rather, than, the, radius, squared, the, electric, potential, at, any, location, r, in, a, system, of, point, charges, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, individual, electric, potentials, due, to, every, point, charge, in, the, system, this, fact, simplifies, calculations, significantly, because, addition, of, potential, scalar, fields, is, much, easier, than, addition, of, the, electric, vector, fields, specifically, the, potential, of, a, set, of, discrete, point, charges, q, i, at, points, r, i, becomes, v, e, r, 1, 4, 0, i, 1, n, q, i, r, r, i, displaystyle, v, mathbf, e, mathbf, r, frac, 1, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, sum, i, 1, n, frac, q, i, mathbf, r, mathbf,

by, si, units, in, some, other, less, common, systems, of, units, such, as, cgs, gaussian, many, of, these, equations, would, be, altered, when, time, varying, magnetic, fields, are, present, which, is, true, whenever, there, are, time, varying, electric, fields, and, vice, versa, it, is, not, possible, to, describe, the, electric, field, simply, as, a, scalar, potential, v, because, the, electric, field, is, no, longer, conservative, c, e, d, displaystyle, textstyle, int, c, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, is, path, dependent, because, e, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, nabla, times, mathbf, e, neq, mathbf, 0, due, to, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, instead, one, can, still, define, a, scalar, potential, by, also, including, the, magnetic, vector, potential, a, in, particular, a, is, defined, to, satisfy, b, a, displaystyle, mathbf, b, mathbf, nabla, times, mathbf, a, where, b, is, the, magnetic, field, by, the, fundamental, theorem, of, vector, calculus, such, an, a, can, always, be, found, since, the, divergence, of, the, magnetic, field, is, always, zero, due, to, the, absence, of, magnetic, monopoles, now, the, quantity, f, e, a, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathbf, e, frac, partial, mathbf, a, partial, t, is, a, conservative, field, since, the, curl, of, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, is, canceled, by, the, curl, of, a, t, displaystyle, frac, partial, mathbf, a, partial, t, according, to, the, maxwell, faraday, equation, one, can, therefore, write, e, v, a, t, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, nabla, v, frac, partial, mathbf, a, partial, t, where, v, is, the, scalar, potential, defined, by, the, conservative, field, f, the, electrostatic, potential, is, simply, the, special, case, of, this, definition, where, a, is, time, invariant, on, the, other, hand, for, time, varying, fields, a, b, e, d, v, b, v, a, displaystyle, int, a, b, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, boldsymbol, ell, neq, v, b, v, a, unlike, electrostatics, the, electrostatic, potential, could, have, any, constant, added, to, it, without, affecting, the, electric, field, in, electrodynamics, the, electric, potential, has, infinitely, many, degrees, of, freedom, for, any, possibly, time, varying, or, space, varying, scalar, field, we, can, perform, the, following, gauge, transformation, to, find, a, new, set, of, potentials, that, produce, exactly, the, same, electric, and, magnetic, fields, v, v, t, a, a, displaystyle, begin, aligned, v, prime, v, frac, partial, psi, partial, t, mathbf, a, prime, mathbf, a, nabla, psi, end, aligned, given, different, choices, of, gauge, the, electric, potential, could, have, quite, different, properties, in, the, coulomb, gauge, the, electric, potential, is, given, by, poisson, s, equation, 2, v, 0, displaystyle, nabla, 2, v, frac, rho, varepsilon, 0, just, like, in, electrostatics, however, in, the, lorenz, gauge, the, electric, potential, is, a, retarded, potential, that, propagates, at, the, speed, of, light, and, is, the, solution, to, an, inhomogeneous, wave, equation, 2, v, 1, c, 2, 2, v, t, 2, 0, displaystyle, nabla, 2, v, frac, 1, c, 2, frac, partial, 2, v, partial, t, 2, frac, rho, varepsilon, 0, the, si, derived, unit, of, electric, potential, is, the, volt, in, honor, of, alessandro, volta, denoted, as, v, which, is, why, the, electric, potential, difference, between, two, points, in, space, is, known, as, a, voltage, older, units, are, rarely, used, today, variants, of, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, of, units, included, a, number, of, different, units, for, electric, potential, including, the, abvolt, and, the, statvolt, inside, metals, and, other, solids, and, liquids, the, energy, of, an, electron, is, affected, not, only, by, the, electric, potential, but, also, by, the, specific, atomic, environment, that, it, is, in, when, a, voltmeter, is, connected, between, two, different, types, of, metal, it, measures, the, potential, difference, corrected, for, the, different, atomic, environments, the, quantity, measured, by, a, voltmeter, is, called, electrochemical, potential, or, fermi, level, while, the, pure, unadjusted, electric, potential, v, is, sometimes, called, the, galvani, potential, the, terms, voltage, and, electric, potential, are, a, bit, ambiguous, but, one, may, refer, to, either, of, these, in, different, contexts, where, displaystyle, lambda, is, uniform, linear, charge, density, where, displaystyle, sigma, is, uniform, surface, charge, density, where, displaystyle, lambda, is, uniform, linear, charge, density, outside, the, sphere, where, q, displaystyle, q, is, the, total, charge, uniformly, distributed, in, the, volume, inside, the, sphere, where, q, displaystyle, q, is, the, total, charge, uniformly, distributed, in, the, volume,

is, the, magnitude, of, electric, dipole, moment
