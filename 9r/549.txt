a, natural, disaster, is, the, very, harmful, impact, on, a, society, or, community, after, a, natural, hazard, event, some, examples, of, natural, hazard, events, include, avalanches, droughts, earthquakes, floods, heat, waves, landslides, tropical, cyclones, volcanic, activity, and, wildfires, additional, natural, hazards, include, blizzards, dust, storms, firestorms, hails, ice, storms, sinkholes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and, tsunamis, a, natural, disaster, can, cause, loss, of, life, or, damage, property, it, typically, causes, economic, damage, how, bad, the, damage, is, depends, on, how, well, people, are, prepared, for, disasters, and, how, strong, the, buildings, roads, and, other, structures, are, scholars, have, been, saying, that, the, term, natural, disaster, is, unsuitable, and, should, be, abandoned, instead, the, simpler, term, disaster, could, be, used, at, the, same, time, the, type, of, hazard, would, be, specified, a, disaster, happens, when, a, natural, or, human, made, hazard, impacts, a, vulnerable, community, it, results, from, the, combination, of, the, hazard, and, the, exposure, of, a, vulnerable, society, nowadays, it, is, hard, to, distinguish, between, natural, and, human, made, disasters, the, term, natural, disaster, was, already, challenged, in, 1976, human, choices, in, architecture, fire, risk, and, resource, management, can, cause, or, worsen, natural, disasters, climate, change, also, affects, how, often, disasters, due, to, extreme, weather, hazards, happen, these, climate, hazards, are, floods, heat, waves, wildfires, tropical, cyclones, and, the, like, some, things, can, make, natural, disasters, worse, examples, are, inadequate, building, norms, marginalization, of, people, and, poor, choices, on, land, use, planning, many, developing, countries, do, not, have, proper, disaster, risk, reduction, systems, this, makes, them, more, vulnerable, to, natural, disasters, than, high, income, countries, an, adverse, event, only, becomes, a, disaster, if, it, occurs, in, an, area, with, a, vulnerable, population, a, natural, disaster, is, the, highly, harmful, impact, on, a, society, or, community, following, a, natural, hazard, event, the, term, disaster, itself, is, defined, as, follows, disasters, are, serious, disruptions, to, the, functioning, of, a, community, that, exceed, its, capacity, to, cope, using, its, own, resources, disasters, can, be, caused, by, natural, man, made, and, technological, hazards, as, well, as, various, factors, that, influence, the, exposure, and, vulnerability, of, a, community, the, us, federal, emergency, management, agency, fema, explains, the, relationship, between, natural, disasters, and, natural, hazards, as, follows, natural, hazards, and, natural, disasters, are, related, but, are, not, the, same, a, natural, hazard, is, the, threat, of, an, event, that, will, likely, have, a, negative, impact, a, natural, disaster, is, the, negative, impact, following, an, actual, occurrence, of, natural, hazard, in, the, event, that, it, significantly, harms, a, community, an, example, of, the, distinction, between, a, natural, hazard, and, a, disaster, is, that, an, earthquake, is, the, hazard, which, caused, the, 1906, san, francisco, earthquake, disaster, a, natural, hazard, is, a, natural, phenomenon, that, might, have, a, negative, effect, on, humans, and, other, animals, or, the, environment, natural, hazard, events, can, be, classified, into, two, broad, categories, geophysical, and, biological, natural, hazards, can, be, provoked, or, affected, by, anthropogenic, processes, e, g, land, use, change, drainage, and, construction, there, are, 18, natural, hazards, included, in, the, national, risk, index, of, fema, avalanche, coastal, flooding, cold, wave, drought, earthquake, hail, heat, wave, tropical, cyclone, ice, storm, landslide, lightning, riverine, flooding, strong, wind, tornado, tsunami, volcanic, activity, wildfire, winter, weather, in, addition, there, are, also, dust, storms, the, term, natural, disaster, has, been, called, a, misnomer, already, in, 1976, a, disaster, is, a, result, of, a, natural, hazard, impacting, a, vulnerable, community, but, disasters, can, be, avoided, earthquakes, droughts, floods, storms, and, other, events, lead, to, disasters, because, of, human, action, and, inaction, poor, land, and, policy, planning, and, deregulation, can, create, worse, conditions, they, often, involve, development, activities, that, ignore, or, fail, to, reduce, the, disaster, risks, nature, alone, is, blamed, for, disasters, even, when, disasters, result, from, failures, in, development, disasters, also, result, from, failure, of, societies, to, prepare, examples, for, such, failures, include, inadequate, building, norms, marginalization, of, people, inequities, overexploitation, of, resources, extreme, urban, sprawl, and, climate, change, defining, disasters, as, solely, natural, events, has, serious, implications, when, it, comes, to, understanding, the, causes, of, a, disaster, and, the, distribution, of, political, and, financial, responsibility, in, disaster, risk, reduction, disaster, management, compensation, insurance, and, disaster, prevention, using, natural, to, describe, disasters, misleads, people, to, think, the, devastating, results, are, inevitable, out, of, our, control, and, are, simply, part, of, a, natural, process, hazards, earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, drought, etc, are, inevitable, but, the, impact, they, have, on, society, is, not, thus, the, term, natural, disaster, is, unsuitable, and, should, be, abandoned, in, favour, of, the, simpler, term, disaster, while, also, specifying, the, category, or, type, of, hazard, as, of, 2019, the, countries, with, the, highest, share, of, disability, adjusted, life, years, daly, lost, due, to, natural, disasters, are, bahamas, haiti, zimbabwe, and, armenia, probably, mainly, due, to, the, spitak, earthquake, the, asia, pacific, region, is, the, world, s, most, disaster, prone, region, a, person, in, asia, pacific, is, five, times, more, likely, to, be, hit, by, a, natural, disaster, than, someone, living, in, other, regions, between, 1995, and, 2015, the, greatest, number, of, natural, disasters, occurred, in, america, china, and, india, in, 2012, there, were, 905, natural, disasters, worldwide, 93, of, which, were, weather, related, disasters, overall, costs, were, us, 170, billion, and, insured, losses, 70, billion, 2012, was, a, moderate, year, 45, were, meteorological, storms, 36, were, hydrological, floods, 12, were, climatological, heat, waves, cold, waves, droughts, wildfires, and, 7, were, geophysical, events, earthquakes, and, volcanic, eruptions, between, 1980, and, 2011, geophysical, events, accounted, for, 14, of, all, natural, catastrophes, developing, countries, often, have, ineffective, communication, systems, as, well, as, insufficient, support, for, disaster, risk, reduction, and, emergency, management, this, makes, them, more, vulnerable, to, natural, disasters, than, high, income, countries, natural, hazards, occur, across, different, time, scales, as, well, as, area, scales, tornadoes, and, flash, floods, are, rapid, onset, events, meaning, they, occur, with, a, short, warning, time, and, are, short, lived, slow, onset, events, can, also, be, very, damaging, for, example, drought, is, a, natural, hazards, that, develops, slowly, sometimes, over, years, a, natural, disaster, may, cause, loss, of, life, injury, or, other, health, impacts, property, damage, loss, of, livelihoods, and, services, social, and, economic, disruption, or, environmental, damage, globally, the, total, number, of, deaths, from, natural, disasters, has, been, reduced, by, 75, over, the, last, 100, years, due, to, the, increased, development, of, countries, increased, preparedness, better, education, better, methods, and, aid, from, international, organizations, since, the, global, population, has, grown, over, the, same, time, period, the, decrease, in, number, of, deaths, per, capita, is, larger, dropping, to, 6, of, the, original, amount, the, death, rate, from, natural, disasters, is, highest, in, developing, countries, due, to, the, lower, quality, of, building, construction, infrastructure, and, medical, facilities, global, economic, losses, due, to, extreme, weather, climate, and, water, events, are, increasing, costs, have, increased, sevenfold, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 2010s, 16, direct, losses, from, disasters, have, averaged, above, us, 330, billion, annually, between, 2015, and, 2021, 21, socio, economic, factors, have, contributed, to, this, trend, of, increasing, losses, such, as, population, growth, and, increased, wealth, this, shows, that, increased, exposure, is, the, most, important, driver, of, economic, losses, however, part, of, these, are, also, due, to, human, induced, climate, change, 1611, during, emergencies, such, as, natural, disasters, and, armed, conflicts, more, waste, may, be, produced, while, waste, management, is, given, low, priority, compared, with, other, services, existing, waste, management, services, and, infrastructures, can, be, disrupted, leaving, communities, with, unmanaged, waste, and, increased, littering, under, these, circumstances, human, health, and, the, environment, are, often, negatively, impacted, natural, disasters, e, g, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, have, the, potential, to, generate, a, significant, amount, of, waste, within, a, short, period, waste, management, systems, can, be, out, of, action, or, curtailed, often, requiring, considerable, time, and, funding, to, restore, for, example, the, tsunami, in, japan, in, 2011, produced, huge, amounts, of, debris, estimates, of, 5, million, tonnes, of, waste, were, reported, by, the, japanese, ministry, of, the, environment, some, of, this, waste, mostly, plastic, and, styrofoam, washed, up, on, the, coasts, of, canada, and, the, united, states, in, late, 2011, along, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, this, increased, the, amount, of, litter, by, a, factor, of, 10, and, may, have, transported, alien, species, storms, are, also, important, generators, of, plastic, litter, a, study, by, lo, et, al, 2020, reported, a, 100, increase, in, the, amount, of, microplastics, on, beaches, surveyed, following, a, typhoon, in, hong, kong, in, 2018, a, significant, amount, of, plastic, waste, can, be, produced, during, disaster, relief, operations, following, the, 2010, earthquake, in, haiti, the, generation, of, waste, from, relief, operations, was, referred, to, as, a, second, disaster, the, united, states, military, reported, that, millions, of, water, bottles, and, styrofoam, food, packages, were, distributed, although, there, was, no, operational, waste, management, system, over, 700, 000, plastic, tarpaulins, and, 100, 000, tents, were, required, for, emergency, shelters, the, increase, in, plastic, waste, combined, with, poor, disposal, practices, resulted, in, open, drainage, channels, being, blocked, increasing, the, risk, of, disease, conflicts, can, result, in, large, scale, displacement, of, communities, people, living, under, these, conditions, are, often, provided, with, minimal, waste, management, facilities, burn, pits, are, widely, used, to, dispose, of, mixed, wastes, including, plastics, air, pollution, can, lead, to, respiratory, and, other, illnesses, for, example, sahrawi, refugees, have, been, living, in, five, camps, near, tindouf, algeria, for, nearly, 45, years, as, waste, collection, services, are, underfunded, and, there, is, no, recycling, facility, plastics, have, flooded, the, camps, streets, and, surroundings, in, contrast, the, azraq, camp, in, jordan, for, refugees, from, syria, has, waste, management, services, of, 20, 7, tonnes, of, waste, produced, per, day, 15, is, recyclable, because, of, the, social, political, and, cultural, context, of, many, places, throughout, the, world, women, are, often, disproportionately, affected, by, disaster, in, the, 2004, indian, ocean, tsunami, more, women, died, than, men, partly, due, to, the, fact, that, fewer, women, knew, how, to, swim, during, and, after, a, natural, disaster, women, are, at, increased, risk, of, being, affected, by, gender, based, violence, and, are, increasingly, vulnerable, to, sexual, violence, disrupted, police, enforcement, lax, regulations, and, displacement, all, contribute, to, increased, risk, of, gender, based, violence, and, sexual, assault, in, addition, to, lgbt, people, and, immigrants, women, are, also, disproportionately, victimized, by, religion, based, scapegoating, for, natural, disasters, fanatical, religious, leaders, or, adherents, may, claim, that, a, god, or, gods, are, angry, with, women, s, independent, freethinking, behaviour, such, as, dressing, immodestly, having, sex, or, abortions, for, example, hindutva, party, hindu, makkal, katchi, and, others, blamed, women, s, struggle, for, the, right, to, enter, the, sabarimala, temple, for, the, august, 2018, kerala, floods, purportedly, inflicted, by, the, angry, god, ayyappan, during, and, after, natural, disasters, routine, health, behaviors, become, interrupted, in, addition, health, care, systems, may, have, broken, down, as, a, result, of, the, disaster, further, reducing, access, to, contraceptives, unprotected, intercourse, during, this, time, can, lead, to, increased, rates, of, childbirth, unintended, pregnancies, and, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, pregnant, women, are, one, of, the, groups, disproportionately, affected, by, natural, disasters, inadequate, nutrition, little, access, to, clean, water, lack, of, health, care, services, and, psychological, stress, in, the, aftermath, of, the, disaster, can, lead, to, a, significant, increase, in, maternal, morbidity, and, mortality, furthermore, shortage, of, healthcare, resources, during, this, time, can, convert, even, routine, obstetric, complications, into, emergencies, once, a, vulnerable, population, has, experienced, a, disaster, the, community, can, take, many, years, to, repair, and, that, repair, period, can, lead, to, further, vulnerability, the, disastrous, consequences, of, natural, disaster, also, affect, the, mental, health, of, affected, communities, often, leading, to, post, traumatic, symptoms, these, increased, emotional, experiences, can, be, supported, through, collective, processing, leading, to, resilience, and, increased, community, engagement, disasters, stress, government, capacity, as, the, government, tries, to, conduct, routine, as, well, as, emergency, operations, some, theorists, of, voting, behavior, propose, that, citizens, update, information, about, government, effectiveness, based, on, their, response, to, disasters, which, affects, their, vote, choice, in, the, next, election, indeed, some, evidence, based, on, data, from, the, united, states, reveals, that, incumbent, parties, can, lose, votes, if, citizens, perceives, them, as, responsible, for, a, poor, disaster, response, or, gain, votes, based, on, perceptions, of, well, executed, relief, work, the, latter, study, also, finds, however, that, voters, do, not, reward, incumbent, parties, for, disaster, preparedness, which, may, end, up, affecting, government, incentives, to, invest, in, such, preparedness, landslides, also, known, as, landslips, or, rockslides, are, several, forms, of, mass, wasting, that, may, include, a, wide, range, of, ground, movements, such, as, rockfalls, mudflows, shallow, or, deep, seated, slope, failures, and, debris, flows, landslides, occur, in, a, variety, of, environments, characterized, by, either, steep, or, gentle, slope, gradients, from, mountain, ranges, to, coastal, cliffs, or, even, underwater, in, which, case, they, are, called, submarine, landslides, gravity, is, the, primary, driving, force, for, a, landslide, to, occur, but, there, are, other, factors, affecting, slope, stability, that, produce, specific, conditions, that, make, a, slope, prone, to, failure, in, many, cases, the, landslide, is, triggered, by, a, specific, event, such, as, a, heavy, rainfall, an, earthquake, a, slope, cut, to, build, a, road, and, many, others, although, this, is, not, always, identifiable, an, avalanche, is, a, rapid, flow, of, snow, down, a, slope, such, as, a, hill, or, mountain, avalanches, can, be, triggered, spontaneously, by, factors, such, as, increased, precipitation, or, snowpack, weakening, or, by, external, means, such, as, humans, other, animals, and, earthquakes, primarily, composed, of, flowing, snow, and, air, large, avalanches, have, the, capability, to, capture, and, move, ice, rocks, and, trees, avalanches, occur, in, two, general, forms, or, combinations, thereof, slab, avalanches, made, of, tightly, packed, snow, triggered, by, a, collapse, of, an, underlying, weak, snow, layer, and, loose, snow, avalanches, made, of, looser, snow, after, being, set, off, avalanches, usually, accelerate, rapidly, and, grow, in, mass, and, volume, as, they, capture, more, snow, if, an, avalanche, moves, fast, enough, some, of, the, snow, may, mix, with, the, air, forming, a, powder, snow, avalanche, an, earthquake, is, the, result, of, a, sudden, release, of, energy, in, the, earth, s, crust, that, creates, seismic, waves, at, the, earth, s, surface, earthquakes, manifest, themselves, by, vibration, shaking, and, sometimes, displacement, of, the, ground, earthquakes, are, caused, by, slippage, within, geological, faults, the, underground, point, of, origin, of, the, earthquake, is, called, the, seismic, focus, the, point, directly, above, the, focus, on, the, surface, is, called, the, epicenter, earthquakes, by, themselves, rarely, kill, people, or, wildlife, it, is, usually, the, secondary, events, that, they, trigger, such, as, building, collapse, fires, tsunamis, and, volcanic, eruptions, that, cause, death, many, of, these, can, possibly, be, avoided, by, better, construction, safety, systems, early, warning, and, planning, a, sinkhole, is, a, depression, or, hole, in, the, ground, caused, by, some, form, of, collapse, of, the, surface, layer, when, natural, erosion, human, mining, or, underground, excavation, makes, the, ground, too, weak, to, support, the, structures, built, on, it, the, ground, can, collapse, and, produce, a, sinkhole, coastal, erosion, is, a, physical, process, by, which, shorelines, in, coastal, areas, around, the, world, shift, and, change, primarily, in, response, to, waves, and, currents, that, can, be, influenced, by, tides, and, storm, surge, coastal, erosion, can, result, from, long, term, processes, see, also, beach, evolution, as, well, as, from, episodic, events, such, as, tropical, cyclones, or, other, severe, storm, events, coastal, erosion, is, one, of, the, most, significant, coastal, hazards, it, forms, a, threat, to, infrastructure, capital, assets, and, property, volcanoes, can, cause, widespread, destruction, and, consequent, disaster, in, several, ways, one, hazard, is, the, volcanic, eruption, itself, with, the, force, of, the, explosion, and, falling, rocks, able, to, cause, harm, lava, may, also, be, released, during, the, eruption, of, a, volcano, as, it, leaves, the, volcano, it, can, destroy, buildings, plants, and, animals, due, to, its, extreme, heat, in, addition, volcanic, ash, may, form, a, cloud, generally, after, cooling, and, settle, thickly, in, nearby, locations, when, mixed, with, water, this, forms, a, concrete, like, material, in, sufficient, quantities, ash, may, cause, roofs, to, collapse, under, its, weight, even, small, quantities, will, harm, humans, if, inhaled, it, has, the, consistency, of, ground, glass, and, therefore, causes, laceration, to, the, throat, and, lungs, volcanic, ash, can, also, cause, abrasion, damage, to, moving, machinery, such, as, engines, the, main, killer, of, humans, in, the, immediate, surroundings, of, a, volcanic, eruption, is, pyroclastic, flows, consisting, of, a, cloud, of, hot, ash, which, builds, up, in, the, air, above, the, volcano, and, rushes, down, the, slopes, when, the, eruption, no, longer, supports, the, lifting, of, the, gases, it, is, believed, that, pompeii, was, destroyed, by, a, pyroclastic, flow, a, lahar, is, a, volcanic, mudflow, or, landslide, the, 1953, tangiwai, disaster, was, caused, by, a, lahar, as, was, the, 1985, armero, tragedy, in, which, the, town, of, armero, was, buried, and, an, estimated, 23, 000, people, were, killed, volcanoes, rated, at, 8, the, highest, level, on, the, volcanic, explosivity, index, are, known, as, supervolcanoes, according, to, the, toba, catastrophe, theory, 75, 000, to, 80, 000, years, ago, a, supervolcanic, eruption, at, what, is, now, lake, toba, in, sumatra, reduced, the, human, population, to, 10, 000, or, even, 1, 000, breeding, pairs, creating, a, bottleneck, in, human, evolution, and, killed, three, quarters, of, all, plant, life, in, the, northern, hemisphere, however, there, is, considerable, debate, regarding, the, veracity, of, this, theory, the, main, danger, from, a, supervolcano, is, the, immense, cloud, of, ash, which, has, a, disastrous, global, effect, on, climate, and, temperature, for, many, years, a, tsunami, plural, tsunamis, or, tsunami, from, japanese, lit, harbour, wave, english, pronunciation, tsu, n, mi, also, known, as, a, seismic, sea, wave, or, tidal, wave, is, a, series, of, waves, in, a, water, body, caused, by, the, displacement, of, a, large, volume, of, water, generally, in, an, ocean, or, a, large, lake, tsunamis, can, be, caused, by, undersea, earthquakes, such, as, the, 2004, boxing, day, tsunami, or, by, landslides, such, as, the, one, in, 1958, at, lituya, bay, alaska, or, by, volcanic, eruptions, such, as, the, ancient, eruption, of, santorini, on, march, 11, 2011, a, tsunami, occurred, near, fukushima, japan, and, spread, through, the, pacific, ocean, some, of, the, 18, natural, hazards, included, in, the, national, risk, index, of, fema, now, have, a, higher, probability, of, occurring, and, at, higher, intensity, due, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, this, applies, to, heat, waves, droughts, wildfire, and, coastal, flooding, 9, a, heat, wave, is, a, period, of, unusually, and, excessively, hot, weather, heat, waves, are, rare, and, require, specific, combinations, of, weather, events, to, take, place, and, may, include, temperature, inversions, katabatic, winds, or, other, phenomena, the, worst, heat, wave, in, recent, history, was, the, european, heat, wave, of, 2003, the, 2010, northern, hemisphere, summer, resulted, in, severe, heat, waves, which, killed, over, 2, 000, people, the, heat, caused, hundreds, of, wildfires, which, led, to, widespread, air, pollution, and, burned, thousands, of, square, kilometers, of, forest, well, known, historical, droughts, include, the, 1997, 2009, millennium, drought, in, australia, which, led, to, a, water, supply, crisis, across, much, of, the, country, as, a, result, many, desalination, plants, were, built, for, the, first, time, see, list, in, 2011, the, state, of, texas, lived, under, a, drought, emergency, declaration, for, the, entire, calendar, year, and, suffered, severe, economic, losses, the, drought, caused, the, bastrop, fires, wildfires, are, large, fires, which, often, start, in, wildland, areas, common, causes, include, lightning, and, drought, but, wildfires, may, also, be, started, by, human, negligence, or, arson, they, can, spread, to, populated, areas, and, thus, be, a, threat, to, humans, and, property, as, well, as, wildlife, one, example, for, a, notable, wildfire, is, the, 1871, peshtigo, fire, in, the, united, states, which, killed, at, least, 1700, people, another, one, is, the, 2009, victorian, bushfires, in, australia, collectively, known, as, black, saturday, bushfires, in, that, year, a, summer, heat, wave, in, victoria, australia, created, conditions, which, fuelled, the, massive, bushfires, in, 2009, melbourne, experienced, three, days, in, a, row, of, temperatures, exceeding, 40, c, 104, f, with, some, regional, areas, sweltering, through, much, higher, temperatures, a, flood, is, an, overflow, of, water, that, submerges, land, the, eu, floods, directive, defines, a, flood, as, a, temporary, covering, of, land, that, is, usually, dry, with, water, in, the, sense, of, flowing, water, the, word, may, also, be, applied, to, the, inflow, of, the, tides, flooding, may, result, from, the, volume, of, a, body, of, water, such, as, a, river, or, lake, becoming, higher, than, usual, causing, some, of, the, water, to, escape, its, usual, boundaries, while, the, size, of, a, lake, or, other, body, of, water, will, vary, with, seasonal, changes, in, precipitation, and, snow, melt, a, flood, is, not, considered, significant, unless, the, water, covers, land, used, by, humans, such, as, a, village, city, or, other, inhabited, area, roads, or, expanses, of, farmland, severe, storms, dust, clouds, and, volcanic, eruptions, can, generate, lightning, apart, from, the, damage, typically, associated, with, storms, such, as, winds, hail, and, flooding, the, lightning, itself, can, damage, buildings, ignite, fires, and, kill, by, direct, contact, most, deaths, from, lightning, occur, in, the, poorer, countries, of, the, americas, and, asia, where, lightning, is, common, and, adobe, mud, brick, housing, provides, little, protection, typhoon, cyclone, cyclonic, storm, and, hurricane, are, different, names, for, the, same, phenomenon, a, tropical, storm, that, forms, over, an, ocean, it, is, caused, by, evaporated, water, that, comes, off, of, the, ocean, and, becomes, a, storm, it, is, characterized, by, strong, winds, heavy, rainfall, and, thunderstorms, the, determining, factor, on, which, term, is, used, is, based, on, where, the, storm, originates, in, the, atlantic, and, northeast, pacific, the, term, hurricane, is, used, in, the, northwest, pacific, it, is, referred, to, as, a, typhoon, a, cyclone, occurs, in, the, south, pacific, and, indian, ocean, the, deadliest, hurricane, ever, was, the, 1970, bhola, cyclone, the, deadliest, atlantic, hurricane, was, the, great, hurricane, of, 1780, which, devastated, martinique, st, eustatius, and, barbados, another, notable, hurricane, is, hurricane, katrina, which, devastated, the, gulf, coast, of, the, united, states, in, 2005, hurricanes, may, become, more, intense, and, produce, more, heavy, rainfall, as, a, consequence, of, human, induced, climate, change, a, tornado, is, a, violent, and, dangerous, rotating, column, of, air, that, is, in, contact, with, both, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, a, cumulonimbus, cloud, or, in, rare, cases, the, base, of, a, cumulus, cloud, it, is, also, referred, to, as, a, twister, or, a, cyclone, although, the, word, cyclone, is, used, in, meteorology, in, a, wider, sense, to, refer, to, any, closed, low, pressure, circulation, tornadoes, come, in, many, shapes, and, sizes, but, typically, take, the, form, of, a, visible, condensation, funnel, the, narrow, end, of, which, touches, the, earth, and, is, often, encircled, by, a, cloud, of, debris, and, dust, tornadoes, can, occur, one, at, a, time, or, can, occur, in, large, tornado, outbreaks, associated, with, supercells, or, in, other, large, areas, of, thunderstorm, development, most, tornadoes, have, wind, speeds, of, less, than, 180, km, h, 110, mph, are, approximately, 75, m, 250, ft, across, and, travel, a, few, kilometers, before, dissipating, the, most, extreme, tornadoes, can, attain, wind, speeds, of, more, than, 480, km, h, 300, mph, stretch, more, than, 3, km, 2, mi, across, and, stay, on, the, ground, for, perhaps, more, than, 100, km, 60, mi, blizzards, are, severe, winter, storms, characterized, by, heavy, snow, and, strong, winds, when, high, winds, stir, up, snow, that, has, already, fallen, it, is, known, as, a, ground, blizzard, blizzards, can, impact, local, economic, activities, especially, in, regions, where, snowfall, is, rare, the, great, blizzard, of, 1888, affected, the, united, states, when, many, tons, of, wheat, crops, were, destroyed, in, asia, the, 1972, iran, blizzard, and, the, 2008, afghanistan, blizzard, were, the, deadliest, blizzards, in, history, in, the, former, an, area, the, size, of, wisconsin, was, entirely, buried, in, snow, the, 1993, superstorm, originated, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, traveled, north, causing, damage, in, 26, american, states, as, well, as, in, canada, and, leading, to, more, than, 300, deaths, hail, is, precipitation, in, the, form, of, ice, that, does, not, melt, before, it, hits, the, ground, hailstorms, are, produced, by, thunderstorms, hailstones, usually, measure, between, 5, and, 150, mm, 1, 4, and, 6, in, in, diameter, these, can, damage, the, location, in, which, they, fall, hailstorms, can, be, especially, devastating, to, farm, fields, ruining, crops, and, damaging, equipment, a, particularly, damaging, hailstorm, hit, munich, germany, on, july, 12, 1984, causing, about, 2, billion, in, insurance, claims, each, of, the, natural, hazard, types, outlined, above, have, very, different, characteristics, in, terms, of, the, spatial, and, temporal, scales, they, influence, hazard, frequency, and, return, period, and, measures, of, intensity, and, impact, these, complexities, result, in, single, hazard, assessments, being, commonplace, where, the, hazard, potential, from, one, particular, hazard, type, is, constrained, in, these, examples, hazards, are, often, treated, as, isolated, or, independent, an, alternative, is, a, multi, hazard, approach, which, seeks, to, identify, all, possible, natural, hazards, and, their, interactions, or, interrelationships, many, examples, exist, of, one, natural, hazard, triggering, or, increasing, the, probability, of, one, or, more, other, natural, hazards, for, example, an, earthquake, may, trigger, landslides, whereas, a, wildfire, may, increase, the, probability, of, landslides, being, generated, in, the, future, a, detailed, review, of, such, interactions, across, 21, natural, hazards, identified, 90, possible, interactions, of, varying, likelihood, and, spatial, importance, there, may, also, be, interactions, between, these, natural, hazards, and, anthropic, processes, for, example, groundwater, abstraction, may, trigger, groundwater, related, subsidence, effective, hazard, analysis, in, any, given, area, e, g, for, the, purposes, of, disaster, risk, reduction, should, ideally, include, an, examination, of, all, relevant, hazards, and, their, interactions, to, be, of, most, use, for, risk, reduction, hazard, analysis, should, be, extended, to, risk, assessment, wherein, the, vulnerability, of, the, built, environment, to, each, of, the, hazards, is, taken, into, account, this, step, is, well, developed, for, seismic, risk, where, the, possible, effect, of, future, earthquakes, on, structures, and, infrastructure, is, assessed, as, well, as, for, risk, from, extreme, wind, and, to, a, lesser, extent, flood, risk, for, other, types, of, natural, hazard, the, calculation, of, risk, is, more, challenging, principally, because, of, the, lack, of, functions, linking, the, intensity, of, a, hazard, and, the, probability, of, different, levels, of, damage, fragility, curves, disaster, management, is, a, main, function, of, civil, protection, or, civil, defence, authorities, it, should, address, all, four, of, the, phases, of, disasters, mitigation, and, prevention, disaster, response, recovery, and, preparedness, it, is, possible, to, include, drr, in, almost, all, areas, of, development, and, humanitarian, work, people, from, local, communities, agencies, or, federal, governments, can, all, propose, drr, strategies, drr, policies, aim, to, define, goals, and, objectives, across, different, timescales, and, with, concrete, targets, indicators, and, time, frames, 16, there, are, some, challenges, for, successful, drr, local, communities, and, organisations, should, be, actively, involved, in, the, planning, process, the, role, and, funding, of, local, government, needs, to, be, considered, also, drr, strategies, should, be, mindful, of, gender, aspects, for, example, studies, have, shown, that, women, and, girls, are, disproportionately, impacted, by, disasters, a, gender, sensitive, approach, would, identify, how, disasters, affect, men, women, boys, and, girls, differently, it, would, shape, policy, that, addresses, people, s, specific, vulnerabilities, and, needs, the, sendai, framework, for, disaster, risk, reduction, is, an, international, initiative, that, has, helped, 123, countries, adopt, both, federal, and, local, drr, strategies, as, of, 2022, the, international, day, for, disaster, risk, reduction, on, october, 13, every, year, has, helped, increase, the, visibility, of, drr, it, aims, to, promote, a, culture, of, prevention, spending, on, drr, is, difficult, to, quantify, for, many, countries, global, estimates, of, costs, are, therefore, not, available, however, an, indication, of, the, costs, for, developing, countries, is, given, by, the, us, 215, billion, to, 387, billion, per, year, up, to, 2030, estimated, costs, for, climate, adaptation, drr, and, climate, adaptation, share, similar, goals, and, strategies, they, both, require, increased, finance, to, address, rising, climate, risks, 49, the, recovery, phase, starts, after, the, immediate, threat, to, human, life, has, subsided, the, immediate, goal, of, the, recovery, phase, is, to, bring, the, affected, area, back, to, normalcy, as, quickly, as, possible, during, reconstruction, it, is, recommended, to, consider, the, location, or, construction, material, of, the, property, the, 1998, un, guiding, principles, on, internal, displacement, and, 2009, kampala, convention, protect, people, displaced, due, to, natural,
