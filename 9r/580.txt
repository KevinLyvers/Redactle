emerald, is, a, gemstone, and, a, variety, of, the, mineral, beryl, be, 3, al, 2, sio, 3, 6, colored, green, by, trace, amounts, of, chromium, or, sometimes, vanadium, beryl, has, a, hardness, of, 7, 5, 8, on, the, mohs, scale, most, emeralds, have, many, inclusions, so, their, toughness, resistance, to, breakage, is, classified, as, generally, poor, emerald, is, a, cyclosilicate, the, word, emerald, is, derived, via, old, french, esmeraude, and, middle, english, emeraude, from, vulgar, latin, esmaralda, esmaraldus, a, variant, of, latin, smaragdus, which, was, via, ancient, greek, sm, ragdos, green, gem, the, greek, word, may, have, a, semitic, sanskrit, or, persian, origin, according, to, webster, s, dictionary, the, term, emerald, was, first, used, in, the, 14th, century, emeralds, like, all, colored, gemstones, are, graded, using, four, basic, parameters, known, as, the, four, c, s, color, clarity, cut, and, carat, weight, normally, in, grading, colored, gemstones, color, is, by, far, the, most, important, criterion, however, in, the, grading, of, emeralds, clarity, is, considered, a, close, second, a, fine, emerald, must, possess, not, only, a, pure, verdant, green, hue, as, described, below, but, also, a, high, degree, of, transparency, to, be, considered, a, top, gemstone, this, member, of, the, beryl, family, ranks, among, the, traditional, big, four, gems, along, with, diamonds, rubies, and, sapphires, in, the, 1960s, the, american, jewelry, industry, changed, the, definition, of, emerald, to, include, the, green, vanadium, bearing, beryl, as, a, result, vanadium, emeralds, purchased, as, emeralds, in, the, united, states, are, not, recognized, as, such, in, the, united, kingdom, and, europe, in, america, the, distinction, between, traditional, emeralds, and, the, new, vanadium, kind, is, often, reflected, in, the, use, of, terms, such, as, colombian, emerald, in, gemology, color, is, divided, into, three, components, hue, saturation, and, tone, emeralds, occur, in, hues, ranging, from, yellow, green, to, blue, green, with, the, primary, hue, necessarily, being, green, yellow, and, blue, are, the, normal, secondary, hues, found, in, emeralds, only, gems, that, are, medium, to, dark, in, tone, are, considered, emeralds, light, toned, gems, are, known, instead, by, the, species, name, green, beryl, the, finest, emeralds, are, approximately, 75, tone, on, a, scale, where, 0, tone, is, colorless, and, 100, is, opaque, black, in, addition, a, fine, emerald, will, be, saturated, and, have, a, hue, that, is, bright, vivid, gray, is, the, normal, saturation, modifier, or, mask, found, in, emeralds, a, grayish, green, hue, is, a, dull, green, hue, emeralds, tend, to, have, numerous, inclusions, and, surface, breaking, fissures, unlike, diamonds, where, the, loupe, standard, i, e, 10, magnification, is, used, to, grade, clarity, emeralds, are, graded, by, eye, thus, if, an, emerald, has, no, visible, inclusions, to, the, eye, assuming, normal, visual, acuity, it, is, considered, flawless, stones, that, lack, surface, breaking, fissures, are, extremely, rare, and, therefore, almost, all, emeralds, are, treated, oiled, see, below, to, enhance, the, apparent, clarity, the, inclusions, and, fissures, within, an, emerald, are, sometimes, described, as, jardin, french, for, garden, because, of, their, mossy, appearance, imperfections, are, unique, for, each, emerald, and, can, be, used, to, identify, a, particular, stone, eye, clean, stones, of, a, vivid, primary, green, hue, as, described, above, with, no, more, than, 15, of, any, secondary, hue, or, combination, either, blue, or, yellow, of, a, medium, dark, tone, command, the, highest, prices, the, relative, non, uniformity, motivates, the, cutting, of, emeralds, in, cabochon, form, rather, than, faceted, shapes, faceted, emeralds, are, most, commonly, given, an, oval, cut, or, the, signature, emerald, cut, a, rectangular, cut, with, facets, around, the, top, edge, most, emeralds, are, oiled, as, part, of, the, post, lapidary, process, in, order, to, fill, in, surface, reaching, cracks, so, that, clarity, and, stability, are, improved, cedar, oil, having, a, similar, refractive, index, is, often, used, in, this, widely, adopted, practice, other, liquids, including, synthetic, oils, and, polymers, with, refractive, indexes, close, to, that, of, emeralds, such, as, opticon, are, also, used, the, least, expensive, emeralds, are, often, treated, with, epoxy, resins, which, are, effective, for, filling, stones, with, many, fractures, these, treatments, are, typically, applied, in, a, vacuum, chamber, under, mild, heat, to, open, the, pores, of, the, stone, and, allow, the, fracture, filling, agent, to, be, absorbed, more, effectively, the, u, s, federal, trade, commission, requires, the, disclosure, of, this, treatment, when, an, oil, treated, emerald, is, sold, the, use, of, oil, is, traditional, and, largely, accepted, by, the, gem, trade, although, oil, treated, emeralds, are, worth, much, less, than, untreated, emeralds, of, similar, quality, untreated, emeralds, must, also, be, accompanied, by, a, certificate, from, a, licensed, independent, gemology, laboratory, other, treatments, for, example, the, use, of, green, tinted, oil, are, not, acceptable, in, the, trade, gems, are, graded, on, a, four, step, scale, none, minor, moderate, and, highly, enhanced, these, categories, reflect, levels, of, enhancement, not, clarity, a, gem, graded, none, on, the, enhancement, scale, may, still, exhibit, visible, inclusions, laboratories, apply, these, criteria, differently, some, gemologists, consider, the, mere, presence, of, oil, or, polymers, to, constitute, enhancement, others, may, ignore, traces, of, oil, if, the, presence, of, the, material, does, not, improve, the, look, of, the, gemstone, emeralds, in, antiquity, were, mined, in, ancient, egypt, at, locations, on, mount, smaragdus, since, 1500, bc, and, india, and, austria, since, at, least, the, 14th, century, ad, the, egyptian, mines, were, exploited, on, an, industrial, scale, by, the, roman, and, byzantine, empires, and, later, by, islamic, conquerors, mining, in, egypt, ceased, with, the, discovery, of, the, colombian, deposits, today, only, ruins, remain, in, egypt, colombia, is, by, far, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, emeralds, constituting, 50, 95, of, the, world, production, with, the, number, depending, on, the, year, source, and, grade, emerald, production, in, colombia, has, increased, drastically, in, the, last, decade, increasing, by, 78, from, 2000, to, 2010, the, three, main, emerald, mining, areas, in, colombia, are, muzo, coscuez, and, chivor, rare, trapiche, emeralds, are, found, in, colombia, distinguished, by, ray, like, spokes, of, dark, impurities, zambia, is, the, world, s, second, biggest, producer, with, its, kafubu, river, area, deposits, kagem, mines, about, 45, km, 28, mi, southwest, of, kitwe, responsible, for, 20, of, the, world, s, production, of, gem, quality, stones, in, 2004, in, the, first, half, of, 2011, the, kagem, mines, produced, 3, 74, tons, of, emeralds, emeralds, are, found, all, over, the, world, in, countries, such, as, afghanistan, australia, austria, brazil, bulgaria, cambodia, canada, china, egypt, ethiopia, france, germany, india, kazakhstan, madagascar, mozambique, namibia, nigeria, norway, pakistan, russia, somalia, south, africa, spain, switzerland, tanzania, the, united, states, zambia, and, zimbabwe, in, the, us, emeralds, have, been, found, in, connecticut, montana, nevada, north, carolina, and, south, carolina, in, 1998, emeralds, were, discovered, in, the, yukon, territory, of, canada, since, the, onset, of, concerns, regarding, diamond, origins, research, has, been, conducted, to, determine, if, the, mining, location, could, be, determined, for, an, emerald, already, in, circulation, traditional, research, used, qualitative, guidelines, such, as, an, emerald, s, color, style, and, quality, of, cutting, type, of, fracture, filling, and, the, anthropological, origins, of, the, artifacts, bearing, the, mineral, to, determine, the, emerald, s, mine, location, more, recent, studies, using, energy, dispersive, x, ray, spectroscopy, methods, have, uncovered, trace, chemical, element, differences, between, emeralds, including, ones, mined, in, close, proximity, to, one, another, american, gemologist, david, cronin, and, his, colleagues, have, extensively, examined, the, chemical, signatures, of, emeralds, resulting, from, fluid, dynamics, and, subtle, precipitation, mechanisms, and, their, research, demonstrated, the, chemical, homogeneity, of, emeralds, from, the, same, mining, location, and, the, statistical, differences, that, exist, between, emeralds, from, different, mining, locations, including, those, between, the, three, locations, muzo, coscuez, and, chivor, in, colombia, south, america, both, hydrothermal, and, flux, growth, synthetics, have, been, produced, and, a, method, has, been, developed, for, producing, an, emerald, overgrowth, on, colorless, beryl, the, first, commercially, successful, emerald, synthesis, process, was, that, of, carroll, chatham, likely, involving, a, lithium, vanadate, flux, process, as, chatham, s, emeralds, do, not, have, any, water, and, contain, traces, of, vanadate, molybdenum, and, vanadium, the, other, large, producer, of, flux, emeralds, was, pierre, gilson, sr, whose, products, have, been, on, the, market, since, 1964, gilson, s, emeralds, are, usually, grown, on, natural, colorless, beryl, seeds, which, are, coated, on, both, sides, growth, occurs, at, the, rate, of, 1, mm, per, month, a, typical, seven, month, growth, run, produces, emerald, crystals, 7, mm, thick, hydrothermal, synthetic, emeralds, have, been, attributed, to, ig, farben, nacken, tairus, and, others, but, the, first, satisfactory, commercial, product, was, that, of, johann, lechleitner, of, innsbruck, austria, which, appeared, on, the, market, in, the, 1960s, these, stones, were, initially, sold, under, the, names, emerita, and, symeralds, and, they, were, grown, as, a, thin, layer, of, emerald, on, top, of, natural, colorless, beryl, stones, later, from, 1965, to, 1970, the, linde, division, of, union, carbide, produced, completely, synthetic, emeralds, by, hydrothermal, synthesis, according, to, their, patents, attributable, to, e, m, flanigen, acidic, conditions, are, essential, to, prevent, the, chromium, which, is, used, as, the, colorant, from, precipitating, also, it, is, important, that, the, silicon, containing, nutrient, be, kept, away, from, the, other, ingredients, to, prevent, nucleation, and, confine, growth, to, the, seed, crystals, growth, occurs, by, a, diffusion, reaction, process, assisted, by, convection, the, largest, producer, of, hydrothermal, emeralds, today, is, tairus, which, has, succeeded, in, synthesizing, emeralds, with, chemical, composition, similar, to, emeralds, in, alkaline, deposits, in, colombia, and, whose, products, are, thus, known, as, colombian, created, emeralds, or, tairus, created, emeralds, luminescence, in, ultraviolet, light, is, considered, a, supplementary, test, when, making, a, natural, versus, synthetic, determination, as, many, but, not, all, natural, emeralds, are, inert, to, ultraviolet, light, many, synthetics, are, also, uv, inert, synthetic, emeralds, are, often, referred, to, as, created, as, their, chemical, and, gemological, composition, is, the, same, as, their, natural, counterparts, the, u, s, federal, trade, commission, ftc, has, very, strict, regulations, as, to, what, can, and, what, cannot, be, called, a, synthetic, stone, the, ftc, says, 23, 23, c, it, is, unfair, or, deceptive, to, use, the, word, laboratory, grown, laboratory, created, created, or, synthetic, with, the, name, of, any, natural, stone, to, describe, any, industry, product, unless, such, industry, product, has, essentially, the, same, optical, physical, and, chemical, properties, as, the, stone, named, emerald, is, regarded, as, the, traditional, birthstone, for, may, as, well, as, the, traditional, gemstone, for, the, astrological, sign, of, taurus, traditional, alchemical, lore, ascribes, several, uses, and, characteristics, to, emeralds, the, virtue, of, the, emerald, is, to, counteract, poison, they, say, that, if, a, venomous, animal, should, look, at, it, it, will, become, blinded, the, gem, also, acts, as, a, preservative, against, epilepsy, it, cures, leprosy, strengthens, sight, and, memory, checks, copulation, during, which, act, it, will, break, if, worn, at, the, time, on, the, finger, according, to, french, writer, brant, me, c, 1540, 1614, hern, n, cort, s, had, one, of, the, emeralds, which, he, had, looted, from, mexico, text, engraved, inter, natos, mulierum, non, surrexit, major, among, those, born, of, woman, there, hath, not, arisen, a, greater, matthew, 11, 11, in, reference, to, john, the, baptist, brant, me, considered, engraving, such, a, beautiful, and, simple, product, of, nature, sacrilegious, and, considered, this, act, the, cause, for, cortez, s, loss, in, 1541, of, an, extremely, precious, pearl, to, which, he, dedicated, a, work, a, beautiful, and, incomparable, pearl, and, even, for, the, death, of, king, charles, ix, of, france, who, died, 1574, soon, afterward, in, american, author, l, frank, baum, s, 1900, children, s, novel, the, wonderful, wizard, of, oz, and, the, 1939, mgm, film, adaptation, the, protagonist, must, travel, to, an, emerald, city, to, meet, the, eponymous, character, the, wizard, the, chief, deity, of, one, of, india, s, most, famous, temples, the, meenakshi, amman, temple, in, madurai, is, the, goddess, meenakshi, whose, idol, is, traditionally, thought, to, be, made,
