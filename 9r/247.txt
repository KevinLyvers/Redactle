in, gamma, ray, astronomy, gamma, ray, bursts, grbs, are, immensely, energetic, explosions, that, have, been, observed, in, distant, galaxies, being, the, brightest, and, most, extreme, explosive, events, in, the, entire, universe, as, nasa, describes, the, bursts, as, the, most, powerful, class, of, explosions, in, the, universe, they, are, the, most, energetic, and, luminous, electromagnetic, events, since, the, big, bang, gamma, ray, bursts, can, last, from, ten, milliseconds, to, several, hours, after, the, initial, flash, of, gamma, rays, an, afterglow, is, emitted, which, is, longer, lived, and, usually, emitted, at, longer, wavelengths, x, ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave, and, radio, the, intense, radiation, of, most, observed, grbs, is, thought, to, be, released, during, a, supernova, or, superluminous, supernova, as, a, high, mass, star, implodes, to, form, a, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, a, subclass, of, grbs, appears, to, originate, from, the, merger, of, binary, neutron, stars, the, sources, of, most, grbs, are, billions, of, light, years, away, from, earth, implying, that, the, explosions, are, both, extremely, energetic, a, typical, burst, releases, as, much, energy, in, a, few, seconds, as, the, sun, will, in, its, entire, 10, billion, year, lifetime, and, extremely, rare, a, few, per, galaxy, per, million, years, all, observed, grbs, have, originated, from, outside, the, milky, way, galaxy, although, a, related, class, of, phenomena, soft, gamma, repeaters, are, associated, with, magnetars, within, the, milky, way, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, a, gamma, ray, burst, in, the, milky, way, pointing, directly, towards, the, earth, could, cause, a, mass, extinction, event, the, late, ordovician, mass, extinction, has, been, hypothesised, by, some, researchers, to, have, occurred, as, a, result, of, such, a, gamma, ray, burst, grbs, were, first, detected, in, 1967, by, the, vela, satellites, which, had, been, designed, to, detect, covert, nuclear, weapons, tests, after, thorough, analysis, this, was, published, in, 1973, following, their, discovery, hundreds, of, theoretical, models, were, proposed, to, explain, these, bursts, such, as, collisions, between, comets, and, neutron, stars, little, information, was, available, to, verify, these, models, until, the, 1997, detection, of, the, first, x, ray, and, optical, afterglows, and, direct, measurement, of, their, redshifts, using, optical, spectroscopy, and, thus, their, distances, and, energy, outputs, these, discoveries, and, subsequent, studies, of, the, galaxies, and, supernovae, associated, with, the, bursts, clarified, the, distance, and, luminosity, of, grbs, definitively, placing, them, in, distant, galaxies, gamma, ray, bursts, were, first, observed, in, the, late, 1960s, by, the, u, s, vela, satellites, which, were, built, to, detect, gamma, radiation, pulses, emitted, by, nuclear, weapons, tested, in, space, the, united, states, suspected, that, the, soviet, union, might, attempt, to, conduct, secret, nuclear, tests, after, signing, the, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, in, 1963, on, july, 2, 1967, at, 14, 19, utc, the, vela, 4, and, vela, 3, satellites, detected, a, flash, of, gamma, radiation, unlike, any, known, nuclear, weapons, signature, uncertain, what, had, happened, but, not, considering, the, matter, particularly, urgent, the, team, at, the, los, alamos, national, laboratory, led, by, ray, klebesadel, filed, the, data, away, for, investigation, as, additional, vela, satellites, were, launched, with, better, instruments, the, los, alamos, team, continued, to, find, inexplicable, gamma, ray, bursts, in, their, data, by, analyzing, the, different, arrival, times, of, the, bursts, as, detected, by, different, satellites, the, team, was, able, to, determine, rough, estimates, for, the, sky, positions, of, 16, bursts, and, definitively, rule, out, a, terrestrial, or, solar, origin, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, data, was, never, classified, after, thorough, analysis, the, findings, were, published, in, 1973, as, an, astrophysical, journal, article, entitled, observations, of, gamma, ray, bursts, of, cosmic, origin, most, early, hypotheses, of, gamma, ray, bursts, posited, nearby, sources, within, the, milky, way, galaxy, from, 1991, the, compton, gamma, ray, observatory, cgro, and, its, burst, and, transient, source, explorer, batse, instrument, an, extremely, sensitive, gamma, ray, detector, provided, data, that, showed, the, distribution, of, grbs, is, isotropic, not, biased, towards, any, particular, direction, in, space, if, the, sources, were, from, within, our, own, galaxy, they, would, be, strongly, concentrated, in, or, near, the, galactic, plane, the, absence, of, any, such, pattern, in, the, case, of, grbs, provided, strong, evidence, that, gamma, ray, bursts, must, come, from, beyond, the, milky, way, however, some, milky, way, models, are, still, consistent, with, an, isotropic, distribution, for, decades, after, the, discovery, of, grbs, astronomers, searched, for, a, counterpart, at, other, wavelengths, i, e, any, astronomical, object, in, positional, coincidence, with, a, recently, observed, burst, astronomers, considered, many, distinct, classes, of, objects, including, white, dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular, clusters, quasars, seyfert, galaxies, and, bl, lac, objects, all, such, searches, were, unsuccessful, and, in, a, few, cases, particularly, well, localized, bursts, those, whose, positions, were, determined, with, what, was, then, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, could, be, clearly, shown, to, have, no, bright, objects, of, any, nature, consistent, with, the, position, derived, from, the, detecting, satellites, this, suggested, an, origin, of, either, very, faint, stars, or, extremely, distant, galaxies, even, the, most, accurate, positions, contained, numerous, faint, stars, and, galaxies, and, it, was, widely, agreed, that, final, resolution, of, the, origins, of, cosmic, gamma, ray, bursts, would, require, both, new, satellites, and, faster, communication, several, models, for, the, origin, of, gamma, ray, bursts, postulated, that, the, initial, burst, of, gamma, rays, should, be, followed, by, afterglow, slowly, fading, emission, at, longer, wavelengths, created, by, collisions, between, the, burst, ejecta, and, interstellar, gas, early, searches, for, this, afterglow, were, unsuccessful, largely, because, it, is, difficult, to, observe, a, burst, s, position, at, longer, wavelengths, immediately, after, the, initial, burst, the, breakthrough, came, in, february, 1997, when, the, satellite, bepposax, detected, a, gamma, ray, burst, grb, 970228, and, when, the, x, ray, camera, was, pointed, towards, the, direction, from, which, the, burst, had, originated, it, detected, fading, x, ray, emission, the, william, herschel, telescope, identified, a, fading, optical, counterpart, 20, hours, after, the, burst, once, the, grb, faded, deep, imaging, was, able, to, identify, a, faint, distant, host, galaxy, at, the, location, of, the, grb, as, pinpointed, by, the, optical, afterglow, because, of, the, very, faint, luminosity, of, this, galaxy, its, exact, distance, was, not, measured, for, several, years, well, after, then, another, major, breakthrough, occurred, with, the, next, event, registered, by, bepposax, grb, 970508, this, event, was, localized, within, four, hours, of, its, discovery, allowing, research, teams, to, begin, making, observations, much, sooner, than, any, previous, burst, the, spectrum, of, the, object, revealed, a, redshift, of, z, 0, 835, placing, the, burst, at, a, distance, of, roughly, 6, billion, light, years, from, earth, this, was, the, first, accurate, determination, of, the, distance, to, a, grb, and, together, with, the, discovery, of, the, host, galaxy, of, 970228, proved, that, grbs, occur, in, extremely, distant, galaxies, within, a, few, months, the, controversy, about, the, distance, scale, ended, grbs, were, extragalactic, events, originating, within, faint, galaxies, at, enormous, distances, the, following, year, grb, 980425, was, followed, within, a, day, by, a, bright, supernova, sn, 1998bw, coincident, in, location, indicating, a, clear, connection, between, grbs, and, the, deaths, of, very, massive, stars, this, burst, provided, the, first, strong, clue, about, the, nature, of, the, systems, that, produce, grbs, bepposax, functioned, until, 2002, and, cgro, with, batse, was, deorbited, in, 2000, however, the, revolution, in, the, study, of, gamma, ray, bursts, motivated, the, development, of, a, number, of, additional, instruments, designed, specifically, to, explore, the, nature, of, grbs, especially, in, the, earliest, moments, following, the, explosion, the, first, such, mission, hete, 2, was, launched, in, 2000, and, functioned, until, 2006, providing, most, of, the, major, discoveries, during, this, period, one, of, the, most, successful, space, missions, to, date, swift, was, launched, in, 2004, and, as, of, may, 2024, is, still, operational, swift, is, equipped, with, a, very, sensitive, gamma, ray, detector, as, well, as, on, board, x, ray, and, optical, telescopes, which, can, be, rapidly, and, automatically, slewed, to, observe, afterglow, emission, following, a, burst, more, recently, the, fermi, mission, was, launched, carrying, the, gamma, ray, burst, monitor, which, detects, bursts, at, a, rate, of, several, hundred, per, year, some, of, which, are, bright, enough, to, be, observed, at, extremely, high, energies, with, fermi, s, large, area, telescope, meanwhile, on, the, ground, numerous, optical, telescopes, have, been, built, or, modified, to, incorporate, robotic, control, software, that, responds, immediately, to, signals, sent, through, the, gamma, ray, burst, coordinates, network, this, allows, the, telescopes, to, rapidly, repoint, towards, a, grb, often, within, seconds, of, receiving, the, signal, and, while, the, gamma, ray, emission, itself, is, still, ongoing, new, developments, since, the, 2000s, include, the, recognition, of, short, gamma, ray, bursts, as, a, separate, class, likely, from, merging, neutron, stars, and, not, associated, with, supernovae, the, discovery, of, extended, erratic, flaring, activity, at, x, ray, wavelengths, lasting, for, many, minutes, after, most, grbs, and, the, discovery, of, the, most, luminous, grb, 080319b, and, the, former, most, distant, grb, 090423, objects, in, the, universe, the, most, distant, known, grb, grb, 090429b, is, now, the, most, distant, known, object, in, the, universe, in, october, 2018, astronomers, reported, that, grb, 150101b, detected, in, 2015, and, gw170817, a, gravitational, wave, event, detected, in, 2017, which, has, been, associated, with, grb170817a, a, burst, detected, 1, 7, seconds, later, may, have, been, produced, by, the, same, mechanism, the, merger, of, two, neutron, stars, the, similarities, between, the, two, events, in, terms, of, gamma, ray, optical, and, x, ray, emissions, as, well, as, to, the, nature, of, the, associated, host, galaxies, are, striking, suggesting, the, two, separate, events, may, both, be, the, result, of, the, merger, of, neutron, stars, and, both, may, be, a, kilonova, which, may, be, more, common, in, the, universe, than, previously, understood, according, to, the, researchers, the, highest, energy, light, observed, from, a, gamma, ray, burst, was, one, teraelectronvolt, from, grb, 190114c, in, 2019, note, this, is, about, a, thousand, times, lower, energy, than, the, highest, energy, light, observed, from, any, source, which, is, 1, 4, petaelectronvolts, as, of, the, year, 2021, the, space, variable, objects, monitor, is, a, small, x, ray, telescope, satellite, for, studying, the, explosions, of, massive, stars, by, analysing, the, resulting, gamma, ray, bursts, developed, by, china, national, space, administration, cnsa, chinese, academy, of, sciences, cas, and, the, french, space, agency, cnes, launched, on, 22, june, 2024, 07, 00, 00, utc, the, taiwan, space, agency, is, launching, a, cubesat, called, the, gamma, ray, transients, monitor, to, track, grbs, and, other, bright, gamma, ray, transients, with, energies, ranging, from, 50, kev, to, 2, mev, in, q4, 2026, the, light, curves, of, gamma, ray, bursts, are, extremely, diverse, and, complex, no, two, gamma, ray, burst, light, curves, are, identical, with, large, variation, observed, in, almost, every, property, the, duration, of, observable, emission, can, vary, from, milliseconds, to, tens, of, minutes, there, can, be, a, single, peak, or, several, individual, subpulses, and, individual, peaks, can, be, symmetric, or, with, fast, brightening, and, very, slow, fading, some, bursts, are, preceded, by, a, precursor, event, a, weak, burst, that, is, then, followed, after, seconds, to, minutes, of, no, emission, at, all, by, the, much, more, intense, true, bursting, episode, the, light, curves, of, some, events, have, extremely, chaotic, and, complicated, profiles, with, almost, no, discernible, patterns, although, some, light, curves, can, be, roughly, reproduced, using, certain, simplified, models, little, progress, has, been, made, in, understanding, the, full, diversity, observed, many, classification, schemes, have, been, proposed, but, these, are, often, based, solely, on, differences, in, the, appearance, of, light, curves, and, may, not, always, reflect, a, true, physical, difference, in, the, progenitors, of, the, explosions, however, plots, of, the, distribution, of, the, observed, duration, for, a, large, number, of, gamma, ray, bursts, show, a, clear, bimodality, suggesting, the, existence, of, two, separate, populations, a, short, population, with, an, average, duration, of, about, 0, 3, seconds, and, a, long, population, with, an, average, duration, of, about, 30, seconds, both, distributions, are, very, broad, with, a, significant, overlap, region, in, which, the, identity, of, a, given, event, is, not, clear, from, duration, alone, additional, classes, beyond, this, two, tiered, system, have, been, proposed, on, both, observational, and, theoretical, grounds, events, with, a, duration, of, less, than, about, two, seconds, are, classified, as, short, gamma, ray, bursts, these, account, for, about, 30, of, gamma, ray, bursts, but, until, 2005, no, afterglow, had, been, successfully, detected, from, any, short, event, and, little, was, known, about, their, origins, since, then, several, dozen, short, gamma, ray, burst, afterglows, have, been, detected, and, localized, several, of, which, are, associated, with, regions, of, little, or, no, star, formation, such, as, large, elliptical, galaxies, this, rules, out, a, link, to, massive, stars, confirming, that, short, events, are, physically, distinct, from, long, events, in, addition, there, has, been, no, association, with, supernovae, the, true, nature, of, these, objects, was, initially, unknown, and, the, leading, hypothesis, was, that, they, originated, from, the, mergers, of, binary, neutron, stars, or, a, neutron, star, with, a, black, hole, such, mergers, were, hypothesized, to, produce, kilonovae, and, evidence, for, a, kilonova, associated, with, grb, 130603b, was, seen, the, mean, duration, of, these, events, of, 0, 2, seconds, suggests, because, of, causality, a, source, of, very, small, physical, diameter, in, stellar, terms, less, than, 0, 2, light, seconds, about, 60, 000, km, or, 37, 000, miles, four, times, the, earth, s, diameter, the, observation, of, minutes, to, hours, of, x, ray, flashes, after, a, short, gamma, ray, burst, is, consistent, with, small, particles, of, a, primary, object, like, a, neutron, star, initially, swallowed, by, a, black, hole, in, less, than, two, seconds, followed, by, some, hours, of, lesser, energy, events, as, remaining, fragments, of, tidally, disrupted, neutron, star, material, no, longer, neutronium, remain, in, orbit, to, spiral, into, the, black, hole, over, a, longer, period, of, time, a, small, fraction, of, short, gamma, ray, bursts, are, probably, produced, by, giant, flares, from, soft, gamma, repeaters, in, nearby, galaxies, the, origin, of, short, grbs, in, kilonovae, was, confirmed, when, short, grb, 170817a, was, detected, only, 1, 7, s, after, the, detection, of, gravitational, wave, gw170817, which, was, a, signal, from, the, merger, of, two, neutron, stars, most, observed, events, 70, have, a, duration, of, greater, than, two, seconds, and, are, classified, as, long, gamma, ray, bursts, because, these, events, constitute, the, majority, of, the, population, and, because, they, tend, to, have, the, brightest, afterglows, they, have, been, observed, in, much, greater, detail, than, their, short, counterparts, almost, every, well, studied, long, gamma, ray, burst, has, been, linked, to, a, galaxy, with, rapid, star, formation, and, in, many, cases, to, a, core, collapse, supernova, as, well, unambiguously, associating, long, grbs, with, the, deaths, of, massive, stars, long, grb, afterglow, observations, at, high, redshift, are, also, consistent, with, the, grb, having, originated, in, star, forming, regions, in, december, 2022, astronomers, reported, the, observation, of, grb, 211211a, the, first, evidence, of, a, long, grb, produced, by, a, neutron, star, merger, with, 51s, grb, 191019a, 2019, and, grb, 230307a, 2023, with, around, 64s, and, 35s, respectively, have, been, also, argued, to, belong, to, this, class, of, long, grbs, from, neutron, star, mergers, these, events, are, at, the, tail, end, of, the, long, grb, duration, distribution, lasting, more, than, 10, 000, seconds, they, have, been, proposed, to, form, a, separate, class, caused, by, the, collapse, of, a, blue, supergiant, star, a, tidal, disruption, event, or, a, new, born, magnetar, only, a, small, number, have, been, identified, to, date, their, primary, characteristic, being, their, gamma, ray, emission, duration, the, most, studied, ultra, long, events, include, grb, 101225a, and, grb, 111209a, the, low, detection, rate, may, be, a, result, of, low, sensitivity, of, current, detectors, to, long, duration, events, rather, than, a, reflection, of, their, true, frequency, a, 2013, study, on, the, other, hand, shows, that, the, existing, evidence, for, a, separate, ultra, long, grb, population, with, a, new, type, of, progenitor, is, inconclusive, and, further, multi, wavelength, observations, are, needed, to, draw, a, firmer, conclusion, gamma, ray, bursts, are, very, bright, as, observed, from, earth, despite, their, typically, immense, distances, an, average, long, grb, has, a, bolometric, flux, comparable, to, a, bright, star, of, our, galaxy, despite, a, distance, of, billions, of, light, years, compared, to, a, few, tens, of, light, years, for, most, visible, stars, most, of, this, energy, is, released, in, gamma, rays, although, some, grbs, have, extremely, luminous, optical, counterparts, as, well, grb, 080319b, for, example, was, accompanied, by, an, optical, counterpart, that, peaked, at, a, visible, magnitude, of, 5, 8, comparable, to, that, of, the, dimmest, naked, eye, stars, despite, the, burst, s, distance, of, 7, 5, billion, light, years, this, combination, of, brightness, and, distance, implies, an, extremely, energetic, source, assuming, the, gamma, ray, explosion, to, be, spherical, the, energy, output, of, grb, 080319b, would, be, within, a, factor, of, two, of, the, rest, mass, energy, of, the, sun, the, energy, which, would, be, released, were, the, sun, to, be, converted, entirely, into, radiation, gamma, ray, bursts, are, thought, to, be, highly, focused, explosions, with, most, of, the, explosion, energy, collimated, into, a, narrow, jet, the, jets, of, gamma, ray, bursts, are, ultrarelativistic, and, are, the, most, relativistic, jets, in, the, universe, the, matter, in, gamma, ray, burst, jets, may, also, become, superluminal, or, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, the, jet, medium, with, there, also, being, effects, of, time, reversibility, the, approximate, angular, width, of, the, jet, that, is, the, degree, of, spread, of, the, beam, can, be, estimated, directly, by, observing, the, achromatic, jet, breaks, in, afterglow, light, curves, a, time, after, which, the, slowly, decaying, afterglow, begins, to, fade, rapidly, as, the, jet, slows, and, can, no, longer, beam, its, radiation, as, effectively, observations, suggest, significant, variation, in, the, jet, angle, from, between, 2, and, 20, degrees, because, their, energy, is, strongly, focused, the, gamma, rays, emitted, by, most, bursts, are, expected, to, miss, the, earth, and, never, be, detected, when, a, gamma, ray, burst, is, pointed, towards, earth, the, focusing, of, its, energy, along, a, relatively, narrow, beam, causes, the, burst, to, appear, much, brighter, than, it, would, have, been, were, its, energy, emitted, spherically, the, total, energy, of, typical, gamma, ray, bursts, has, been, estimated, at, 3, 10, 44, j, which, is, larger, than, the, total, energy, 10, 44, j, of, ordinary, supernovae, type, ia, ibc, ii, with, gamma, ray, bursts, also, being, more, powerful, than, the, typical, supernova, very, bright, supernovae, have, been, observed, to, accompany, several, of, the, nearest, grbs, further, support, for, focusing, of, the, output, of, grbs, comes, from, observations, of, strong, asymmetries, in, the, spectra, of, nearby, type, ic, supernovae, and, from, radio, observations, taken, long, after, bursts, when, their, jets, are, no, longer, relativistic, however, a, competing, model, the, binary, driven, hypernova, model, developed, by, remo, ruffini, and, others, at, icranet, accepts, the, extreme, isotropic, energy, totals, as, being, true, with, there, being, no, need, to, correct, for, beaming, they, also, note, that, the, extreme, beaming, angles, in, the, standard, fireball, model, have, never, been, physically, corroborated, with, the, discovery, of, grb, 190114c, astronomers, may, have, been, missing, half, of, the, total, energy, that, gamma, ray, bursts, produce, with, konstancja, satalecka, an, astrophysicist, at, the, german, electron, synchrotron, stating, that, our, measurements, show, that, the, energy, released, in, very, high, energy, gamma, rays, is, comparable, to, the, amount, radiated, at, all, lower, energies, taken, together, short, time, duration, grbs, appear, to, come, from, a, lower, redshift, i, e, less, distant, population, and, are, less, luminous, than, long, grbs, the, degree, of, beaming, in, short, bursts, has, not, been, accurately, measured, but, as, a, population, they, are, likely, less, collimated, than, long, grbs, or, possibly, not, collimated, at, all, in, some, cases, because, of, the, immense, distances, of, most, gamma, ray, burst, sources, from, earth, identification, of, the, progenitors, the, systems, that, produce, these, explosions, is, challenging, the, association, of, some, long, grbs, with, supernovae, and, the, fact, that, their, host, galaxies, are, rapidly, star, forming, offer, very, strong, evidence, that, long, gamma, ray, bursts, are, associated, with, massive, stars, the, most, widely, accepted, mechanism, for, the, origin, of, long, duration, grbs, is, the, collapsar, model, in, which, the, core, of, an, extremely, massive, low, metallicity, rapidly, rotating, star, collapses, into, a, black, hole, in, the, final, stages, of, its, evolution, matter, near, the, star, s, core, rains, down, towards, the, center, and, swirls, into, a, high, density, accretion, disk, the, infall, of, this, material, into, a, black, hole, drives, a, pair, of, relativistic, jets, out, along, the, rotational, axis, which, pummel, through, the, stellar, envelope, and, eventually, break, through, the, stellar, surface, and, radiate, as, gamma, rays, some, alternative, models, replace, the, black, hole, with, a, newly, formed, magnetar, although, most, other, aspects, of, the, model, the, collapse, of, the, core, of, a, massive, star, and, the, formation, of, relativistic, jets, are, the, same, however, a, new, model, which, has, gained, support, and, was, developed, by, the, italian, astrophysicist, remo, ruffini, and, other, scientists, at, icranet, is, that, of, the, binary, driven, hypernova, bdhn, model, the, model, succeeds, and, improves, upon, both, the, fireshell, model, and, the, induced, gravitational, collapse, igc, paradigm, suggested, before, and, explains, all, aspects, of, gamma, ray, bursts, the, model, posits, long, gamma, ray, bursts, as, occurring, in, binary, systems, with, a, carbon, oxygen, core, and, a, companion, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, furthermore, the, energy, of, grbs, in, the, model, is, isotropic, instead, of, collimated, the, creators, of, the, model, have, noted, the, numerous, drawbacks, of, the, standard, fireball, model, as, motivation, for, developing, the, model, such, as, the, markedly, different, energetics, for, supernova, and, gamma, ray, bursts, and, the, fact, that, the, existence, of, extremely, narrow, beaming, angles, have, never, been, observationally, corroborated, the, closest, analogs, within, the, milky, way, galaxy, of, the, stars, producing, long, gamma, ray, bursts, are, likely, the, wolf, rayet, stars, extremely, hot, and, massive, stars, which, have, shed, most, or, all, of, their, hydrogen, envelope, eta, carinae, apep, and, wr, 104, have, been, cited, as, possible, future, gamma, ray, burst, progenitors, it, is, unclear, if, any, star, in, the, milky, way, has, the, appropriate, characteristics, to, produce, a, gamma, ray, burst, the, massive, star, model, probably, does, not, explain, all, types, of, gamma, ray, burst, there, is, strong, evidence, that, some, short, duration, gamma, ray, bursts, occur, in, systems, with, no, star, formation, and, no, massive, stars, such, as, elliptical, galaxies, and, galaxy, halos, the, favored, hypothesis, for, the, origin, of, most, short, gamma, ray, bursts, is, the, merger, of, a, binary, system, consisting, of, two, neutron, stars, according, to, this, model, the, two, stars, in, a, binary, slowly, spiral, towards, each, other, because, gravitational, radiation, releases, energy, until, tidal, forces, suddenly, rip, the, neutron, stars, apart, and, they, collapse, into, a, single, black, hole, the, infall, of, matter, into, the, new, black, hole, produces, an, accretion, disk, and, releases, a, burst, of, energy, analogous, to, the, collapsar, model, numerous, other, models, have, also, been, proposed, to, explain, short, gamma, ray, bursts, including, the, merger, of, a, neutron, star, and, a, black, hole, the, accretion, induced, collapse, of, a, neutron, star, or, the, evaporation, of, primordial, black, holes, an, alternative, explanation, proposed, by, friedwardt, winterberg, is, that, in, the, course, of, a, gravitational, collapse, and, in, reaching, the, event, horizon, of, a, black, hole, all, matter, disintegrates, into, a, burst, of, gamma, radiation, this, class, of, grb, like, events, was, first, discovered, through, the, detection, of, swift, j1644, 57, originally, classified, as, grb, 110328a, by, the, swift, gamma, ray, burst, mission, on, 28, march, 2011, this, event, had, a, gamma, ray, duration, of, about, 2, days, much, longer, than, even, ultra, long, grbs, and, was, detected, in, many, frequencies, for, months, and, years, after, it, occurred, at, the, center, of, a, small, elliptical, galaxy, at, redshift, 3, 8, billion, light, years, away, this, event, has, been, accepted, as, a, tidal, disruption, event, tde, where, a, star, wanders, too, close, to, a, supermassive, black, hole, shredding, the, star, in, the, case, of, swift, j1644, 57, an, astrophysical, jet, traveling, at, near, the, speed, of, light, was, launched, and, lasted, roughly, 1, 5, years, before, turning, off, since, 2011, only, 4, jetted, tdes, have, been, discovered, of, which, 3, were, detected, in, gamma, rays, including, swift, j1644, 57, it, is, estimated, that, just, 1, of, all, tdes, are, jetted, events, the, means, by, which, gamma, ray, bursts, convert, energy, into, radiation, remains, poorly, understood, and, as, of, 2010, there, was, still, no, generally, accepted, model, for, how, this, process, occurs, any, successful, model, of, grb, emission, must, explain, the, physical, process, for, generating, gamma, ray, emission, that, matches, the, observed, diversity, of, light, curves, spectra, and, other, characteristics, particularly, challenging, is, the, need, to, explain, the, very, high, efficiencies, that, are, inferred, from, some, explosions, some, gamma, ray, bursts, may, convert, as, much, as, half, or, more, of, the, explosion, energy, into, gamma, rays, early, observations, of, the, bright, optical, counterparts, to, grb, 990123, and, to, grb, 080319b, whose, optical, light, curves, were, extrapolations, of, the, gamma, ray, light, spectra, have, suggested, that, inverse, compton, scattering, may, be, the, dominant, process, in, some, events, in, this, model, pre, existing, low, energy, photons, are, scattered, by, relativistic, electrons, within, the, explosion, augmenting, their, energy, by, a, large, factor, and, transforming, them, into, gamma, rays, the, nature, of, the, longer, wavelength, afterglow, emission, ranging, from, x, ray, through, radio, that, follows, gamma, ray, bursts, is, better, understood, any, energy, released, by, the, explosion, not, radiated, away, in, the, burst, itself, takes, the, form, of, matter, or, energy, moving, outward, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, as, this, matter, collides, with, the, surrounding, interstellar, gas, it, creates, a, relativistic, shock, wave, that, then, propagates, forward, into, interstellar, space, a, second, shock, wave, the, reverse, shock, may, propagate, back, into, the, ejected, matter, extremely, energetic, electrons, within, the, shock, wave, are, accelerated, by, strong, local, magnetic, fields, and, radiate, as, synchrotron, emission, across, most, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, this, model, has, generally, been, successful, in, modeling, the, behavior, of, many, observed, afterglows, at, late, times, generally, hours, to, days, after, the, explosion, although, there, are, difficulties, explaining, all, features, of, the, afterglow, very, shortly, after, the, gamma, ray, burst, has, occurred, gamma, ray, bursts, can, have, harmful, or, destructive, effects, on, life, considering, the, universe, as, a, whole, the, safest, environments, for, life, similar, to, that, on, earth, are, the, lowest, density, regions, in, the, outskirts, of, large, galaxies, our, knowledge, of, galaxy, types, and, their, distribution, suggests, that, life, as, we, know, it, can, only, exist, in, about, 10, of, all, galaxies, furthermore, galaxies, with, a, redshift, z, higher, than, 0, 5, are, unsuitable, for, life, as, we, know, it, because, of, their, higher, rate, of, grbs, and, their, stellar, compactness, all, grbs, observed, to, date, have, occurred, well, outside, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, have, been, harmless, to, earth, however, if, a, grb, were, to, occur, within, the, milky, way, within, 5, 000, to, 8, 000, light, years, and, its, emission, were, beamed, straight, towards, earth, the, effects, could, be, harmful, and, potentially, devastating, for, its, ecosystems, currently, orbiting, satellites, detect, on, average, approximately, one, grb, per, day, the, closest, observed, grb, as, of, march, 2014, was, grb, 980425, located, 40, megaparsecs, 130, 000, 000, ly, away, z, 0, 0085, in, an, sbc, type, dwarf, galaxy, grb, 980425, was, far, less, energetic, than, the, average, grb, and, was, associated, with, the, type, ib, supernova, sn, 1998bw, estimating, the, exact, rate, at, which, grbs, occur, is, difficult, for, a, galaxy, of, approximately, the, same, size, as, the, milky, way, estimates, of, the, expected, rate, for, long, duration, grbs, can, range, from, one, burst, every, 10, 000, years, to, one, burst, every, 1, 000, 000, years, only, a, small, percentage, of, these, would, be, beamed, towards, earth, estimates, of, rate, of, occurrence, of, short, duration, grbs, are, even, more, uncertain, because, of, the, unknown, degree, of, collimation, but, are, probably, comparable, since, grbs, are, thought, to, involve, beamed, emission, along, two, jets, in, opposing, directions, only, planets, in, the, path, of, these, jets, would, be, subjected, to, the, high, energy, gamma, radiation, a, grb, would, be, able, to, vaporize, anything, in, its, beams, out, to, around, 200, light, years, although, nearby, grbs, hitting, earth, with, a, destructive, shower, of, gamma, rays, are, only, hypothetical, events, high, energy, processes, across, the, galaxy, have, been, observed, to, affect, the, earth, s, atmosphere, earth, s, atmosphere, is, very, effective, at, absorbing, high, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, so, these, types, of, radiation, would, not, reach, any, dangerous, levels, at, the, surface, during, the, burst, event, itself, the, immediate, effect, on, life, on, earth, from, a, grb, within, a, few, kilo, parsecs, would, only, be, a, short, increase, in, ultraviolet, radiation, at, ground, level, lasting, from, less, than, a, second, to, tens, of, seconds, this, ultraviolet, radiation, could, potentially, reach, dangerous, levels, depending, on, the, exact, nature, and, distance, of, the, burst, but, it, seems, unlikely, to, be, able, to, cause, a, global, catastrophe, for, life, on, earth, the, long, term, effects, from, a, nearby, burst, are, more, dangerous, gamma, rays, cause, chemical, reactions, in, the, atmosphere, involving, oxygen, and, nitrogen, molecules, creating, first, nitrogen, oxide, then, nitrogen, dioxide, gas, the, nitrogen, oxides, cause, dangerous, effects, on, three, levels, first, they, deplete, ozone, with, models, showing, a, possible, global, reduction, of, 25, 35, with, as, much, as, 75, in, certain, locations, an, effect, that, would, last, for, years, this, reduction, is, enough, to, cause, a, dangerously, elevated, uv, index, at, the, surface, secondly, the, nitrogen, oxides, cause, photochemical, smog, which, darkens, the, sky, and, blocks, out, parts, of, the, sunlight, spectrum, this, would, affect, photosynthesis, but, models, show, only, about, a, 1, reduction, of, the, total, sunlight, spectrum, lasting, a, few, years, however, the, smog, could, potentially, cause, a, cooling, effect, on, earth, s, climate, producing, a, cosmic, winter, similar, to, an, impact, winter, but, without, an, impact, but, only, if, it, occurs, simultaneously, with, a, global, climate, instability, thirdly, the, elevated, nitrogen, dioxide, levels, in, the, atmosphere, would, wash, out, and, produce, acid, rain, nitric, acid, is, toxic, to, a, variety, of, organisms, including, amphibian, life, but, models, predict, that, it, would, not, reach, levels, that, would, cause, a, serious, global, effect, the, nitrates, might, in, fact, be, of, benefit, to, some, plants, all, in, all, a, grb, within, a, few, kiloparsecs, with, its, energy, directed, towards, earth, will, mostly, damage, life, by, raising, the, uv, levels, during, the, burst, itself, and, for, a, few, years, thereafter, models, show, that, the, destructive, effects, of, this, increase, can, cause, up, to, 16, times, the, normal, levels, of, dna, damage, it, has, proved, difficult, to, assess, a, reliable, evaluation, of, the, consequences, of, this, on, the, terrestrial, ecosystem, because, of, the, uncertainty, in, biological, field, and, laboratory, data, there, is, a, very, good, chance, but, no, certainty, that, at, least, one, lethal, grb, took, place, during, the, past, 5, billion, years, close, enough, to, earth, as, to, significantly, damage, life, there, is, a, 50, chance, that, such, a, lethal, grb, took, place, within, two, kiloparsecs, of, earth, during, the, last, 500, million, years, causing, one, of, the, major, mass, extinction, events, the, major, ordovician, silurian, extinction, event, 450, million, years, ago, may, have, been, caused, by, a, grb, estimates, suggest, that, approximately, 20, 60, of, the, total, phytoplankton, biomass, in, the, ordovician, oceans, would, have, perished, in, a, grb, because, the, oceans, were, mostly, oligotrophic, and, clear, the, late, ordovician, species, of, trilobites, that, spent, portions, of, their, lives, in, the, plankton, layer, near, the, ocean, surface, were, much, harder, hit, than, deep, water, dwellers, which, tended, to, remain, within, quite, restricted, areas, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, usual, pattern, of, extinction, events, wherein, species, with, more, widely, spread, populations, typically, fare, better, a, possible, explanation, is, that, trilobites, remaining, in, deep, water, would, be, more, shielded, from, the, increased, uv, radiation, associated, with, a, grb, also, supportive, of, this, hypothesis, is, the, fact, that, during, the, late, ordovician, burrowing, bivalve, species, were, less, likely, to, go, extinct, than, bivalves, that, lived, on, the, surface, a, case, has, been, made, that, the, 774, 775, carbon, 14, spike, was, the, result, of, a, short, grb, though, a, very, strong, solar, flare, is, another, possibility, no, gamma, ray, bursts, from, within, our, own, galaxy, the, milky, way, have, been, observed, and, the, question, of, whether, one, has, ever, occurred, remains, unresolved, in, light, of, evolving, understanding, of, gamma, ray, bursts, and, their, progenitors, the, scientific, literature, records, a, growing, number, of, local, past, and, future, grb, candidates, long, duration, grbs, are, related, to, superluminous, supernovae, or, hypernovae, and, most, luminous, blue, variables, lbvs, and, rapidly, spinning, wolf, rayet, stars, are, thought, to, end, their, life, cycles, in, core, collapse, supernovae, with, an, associated, long, duration, grb, knowledge, of, grbs, however, is, from, metal, poor, galaxies, of, former, epochs, of, the, universe, s, evolution, and, it, is, impossible, to, directly, extrapolate, to, encompass, more, evolved, galaxies, and, stellar, environments, with, a, higher, metallicity, such, as, the, milky, way
