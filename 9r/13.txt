metrology, is, the, scientific, study, of, measurement, it, establishes, a, common, understanding, of, units, crucial, in, linking, human, activities, modern, metrology, has, its, roots, in, the, french, revolution, s, political, motivation, to, standardise, units, in, france, when, a, length, standard, taken, from, a, natural, source, was, proposed, this, led, to, the, creation, of, the, decimal, based, metric, system, in, 1795, establishing, a, set, of, standards, for, other, types, of, measurements, several, other, countries, adopted, the, metric, system, between, 1795, and, 1875, to, ensure, conformity, between, the, countries, the, bureau, international, des, poids, et, mesures, bipm, was, established, by, the, metre, convention, this, has, evolved, into, the, international, system, of, units, si, as, a, result, of, a, resolution, at, the, 11th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, in, 1960, metrology, is, divided, into, three, basic, overlapping, activities, these, overlapping, activities, are, used, in, varying, degrees, by, the, three, basic, sub, fields, of, metrology, in, each, country, a, national, measurement, system, nms, exists, as, a, network, of, laboratories, calibration, facilities, and, accreditation, bodies, which, implement, and, maintain, its, metrology, infrastructure, the, nms, affects, how, measurements, are, made, in, a, country, and, their, recognition, by, the, international, community, which, has, a, wide, ranging, impact, in, its, society, including, economics, energy, environment, health, manufacturing, industry, and, consumer, confidence, the, effects, of, metrology, on, trade, and, economy, are, some, of, the, easiest, observed, societal, impacts, to, facilitate, fair, trade, there, must, be, an, agreed, upon, system, of, measurement, the, ability, to, measure, alone, is, insufficient, standardisation, is, crucial, for, measurements, to, be, meaningful, the, first, record, of, a, permanent, standard, was, in, 2900, bc, when, the, royal, egyptian, cubit, was, carved, from, black, granite, the, cubit, was, decreed, to, be, the, length, of, the, pharaoh, s, forearm, plus, the, width, of, his, hand, and, replica, standards, were, given, to, builders, the, success, of, a, standardised, length, for, the, building, of, the, pyramids, is, indicated, by, the, lengths, of, their, bases, differing, by, no, more, than, 0, 05, per, cent, in, china, weights, and, measures, had, a, semi, religious, meaning, as, it, was, used, in, the, various, crafts, by, the, artificers, and, in, ritual, utensils, and, is, mentioned, in, the, book, of, rites, along, with, the, steelyard, balance, and, other, tools, other, civilizations, produced, generally, accepted, measurement, standards, with, roman, and, greek, architecture, based, on, distinct, systems, of, measurement, the, collapse, of, the, empires, and, the, dark, ages, that, followed, lost, much, measurement, knowledge, and, standardisation, although, local, systems, of, measurement, were, common, comparability, was, difficult, since, many, local, systems, were, incompatible, england, established, the, assize, of, measures, to, create, standards, for, length, measurements, in, 1196, and, the, 1215, magna, carta, included, a, section, for, the, measurement, of, wine, and, beer, modern, metrology, has, its, roots, in, the, french, revolution, with, a, political, motivation, to, harmonise, units, throughout, france, a, length, standard, based, on, a, natural, source, was, proposed, in, march, 1791, the, metre, was, defined, this, led, to, the, creation, of, the, decimal, based, metric, system, in, 1795, establishing, standards, for, other, types, of, measurements, several, other, countries, adopted, the, metric, system, between, 1795, and, 1875, to, ensure, international, conformity, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, french, bureau, international, des, poids, et, mesures, or, bipm, was, formed, by, the, metre, convention, although, the, bipm, s, original, mission, was, to, create, international, standards, for, units, of, measurement, and, relate, them, to, national, standards, to, ensure, conformity, its, scope, has, broadened, to, include, electrical, and, photometric, units, and, ionizing, radiation, measurement, standards, the, metric, system, was, modernised, in, 1960, with, the, creation, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, as, a, result, of, a, resolution, at, the, 11th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, french, conference, generale, des, poids, et, mesures, or, cgpm, metrology, is, defined, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, as, the, science, of, measurement, embracing, both, experimental, and, theoretical, determinations, at, any, level, of, uncertainty, in, any, field, of, science, and, technology, it, establishes, a, common, understanding, of, units, crucial, to, human, activity, metrology, is, a, wide, reaching, field, but, can, be, summarized, through, three, basic, activities, the, definition, of, internationally, accepted, units, of, measurement, the, realisation, of, these, units, of, measurement, in, practice, and, the, application, of, chains, of, traceability, linking, measurements, to, reference, standards, these, concepts, apply, in, different, degrees, to, metrology, s, three, main, fields, scientific, metrology, applied, technical, or, industrial, metrology, and, legal, metrology, scientific, metrology, is, concerned, with, the, establishment, of, units, of, measurement, the, development, of, new, measurement, methods, the, realisation, of, measurement, standards, and, the, transfer, of, traceability, from, these, standards, to, users, in, a, society, this, type, of, metrology, is, considered, the, top, level, of, metrology, which, strives, for, the, highest, degree, of, accuracy, bipm, maintains, a, database, of, the, metrological, calibration, and, measurement, capabilities, of, institutes, around, the, world, these, institutes, whose, activities, are, peer, reviewed, provide, the, fundamental, reference, points, for, metrological, traceability, in, the, area, of, measurement, bipm, has, identified, nine, metrology, areas, which, are, acoustics, electricity, and, magnetism, length, mass, and, related, quantities, photometry, and, radiometry, ionizing, radiation, time, and, frequency, thermometry, and, chemistry, as, of, may, 2019, no, physical, objects, define, the, base, units, the, motivation, in, the, change, of, the, base, units, is, to, make, the, entire, system, derivable, from, physical, constants, which, required, the, removal, of, the, prototype, kilogram, as, it, is, the, last, artefact, the, unit, definitions, depend, on, scientific, metrology, plays, an, important, role, in, this, redefinition, of, the, units, as, precise, measurements, of, the, physical, constants, is, required, to, have, accurate, definitions, of, the, base, units, to, redefine, the, value, of, a, kilogram, without, an, artefact, the, value, of, the, planck, constant, must, be, known, to, twenty, parts, per, billion, scientific, metrology, through, the, development, of, the, kibble, balance, and, the, avogadro, project, has, produced, a, value, of, planck, constant, with, low, enough, uncertainty, to, allow, for, a, redefinition, of, the, kilogram, applied, technical, or, industrial, metrology, is, concerned, with, the, application, of, measurement, to, manufacturing, and, other, processes, and, their, use, in, society, ensuring, the, suitability, of, measurement, instruments, their, calibration, and, quality, control, producing, good, measurements, is, important, in, industry, as, it, has, an, impact, on, the, value, and, quality, of, the, end, product, and, a, 10, 15, impact, on, production, costs, although, the, emphasis, in, this, area, of, metrology, is, on, the, measurements, themselves, traceability, of, the, measuring, device, calibration, is, necessary, to, ensure, confidence, in, the, measurement, recognition, of, the, metrological, competence, in, industry, can, be, achieved, through, mutual, recognition, agreements, accreditation, or, peer, review, industrial, metrology, is, important, to, a, country, s, economic, and, industrial, development, and, the, condition, of, a, country, s, industrial, metrology, program, can, indicate, its, economic, status, legal, metrology, concerns, activities, which, result, from, statutory, requirements, and, concern, measurement, units, of, measurement, measuring, instruments, and, methods, of, measurement, and, which, are, performed, by, competent, bodies, such, statutory, requirements, may, arise, from, the, need, for, protection, of, health, public, safety, the, environment, enabling, taxation, protection, of, consumers, and, fair, trade, the, international, organization, for, legal, metrology, oiml, was, established, to, assist, in, harmonising, regulations, across, national, boundaries, to, ensure, that, legal, requirements, do, not, inhibit, trade, this, harmonisation, ensures, that, certification, of, measuring, devices, in, one, country, is, compatible, with, another, country, s, certification, process, allowing, the, trade, of, the, measuring, devices, and, the, products, that, rely, on, them, welmec, was, established, in, 1990, to, promote, cooperation, in, the, field, of, legal, metrology, in, the, european, union, and, among, european, free, trade, association, efta, member, states, in, the, united, states, legal, metrology, is, under, the, authority, of, the, office, of, weights, and, measures, of, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, enforced, by, the, individual, states, the, international, system, of, units, si, defines, seven, base, units, length, mass, time, electric, current, thermodynamic, temperature, amount, of, substance, and, luminous, intensity, by, convention, each, of, these, units, are, considered, to, be, mutually, independent, and, can, be, constructed, directly, from, their, defining, constants, 129, all, other, si, units, are, constructed, as, products, of, powers, of, the, seven, base, units, 129, since, the, base, units, are, the, reference, points, for, all, measurements, taken, in, si, units, if, the, reference, value, changed, all, prior, measurements, would, be, incorrect, before, 2019, if, a, piece, of, the, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, had, been, snapped, off, it, would, have, still, been, defined, as, a, kilogram, all, previous, measured, values, of, a, kilogram, would, be, heavier, the, importance, of, reproducible, si, units, has, led, the, bipm, to, complete, the, task, of, defining, all, si, base, units, in, terms, of, physical, constants, by, defining, si, base, units, with, respect, to, physical, constants, and, not, artefacts, or, specific, substances, they, are, realisable, with, a, higher, level, of, precision, and, reproducibility, as, of, the, revision, of, the, si, on, 20, may, 2019, the, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and, mole, are, defined, by, setting, exact, numerical, values, for, the, planck, constant, h, the, elementary, electric, charge, e, the, boltzmann, constant, k, and, the, avogadro, constant, n, a, respectively, the, second, metre, and, candela, have, previously, been, defined, by, physical, constants, the, caesium, standard, cs, the, speed, of, light, c, and, the, luminous, efficacy, of, 540, 10, 12, hz, visible, light, radiation, k, cd, subject, to, correction, to, their, present, definitions, the, new, definitions, aim, to, improve, the, si, without, changing, the, size, of, any, units, thus, ensuring, continuity, with, existing, measurements, 123, 128, the, realisation, of, a, unit, of, measure, is, its, conversion, into, reality, three, possible, methods, of, realisation, are, defined, by, the, international, vocabulary, of, metrology, vim, a, physical, realisation, of, the, unit, from, its, definition, a, highly, reproducible, measurement, as, a, reproduction, of, the, definition, such, as, the, quantum, hall, effect, for, the, ohm, and, the, use, of, a, material, object, as, the, measurement, standard, a, standard, or, etalon, is, an, object, system, or, experiment, with, a, defined, relationship, to, a, unit, of, measurement, of, a, physical, quantity, standards, are, the, fundamental, reference, for, a, system, of, weights, and, measures, by, realising, preserving, or, reproducing, a, unit, against, which, measuring, devices, can, be, compared, there, are, three, levels, of, standards, in, the, hierarchy, of, metrology, primary, secondary, and, working, standards, primary, standards, the, highest, quality, do, not, reference, any, other, standards, secondary, standards, are, calibrated, with, reference, to, a, primary, standard, working, standards, used, to, calibrate, or, check, measuring, instruments, or, other, material, measures, are, calibrated, with, respect, to, secondary, standards, the, hierarchy, preserves, the, quality, of, the, higher, standards, an, example, of, a, standard, would, be, gauge, blocks, for, length, a, gauge, block, is, a, block, of, metal, or, ceramic, with, two, opposing, faces, ground, precisely, flat, and, parallel, a, precise, distance, apart, the, length, of, the, path, of, light, in, vacuum, during, a, time, interval, of, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, is, embodied, in, an, artefact, standard, such, as, a, gauge, block, this, gauge, block, is, then, a, primary, standard, which, can, be, used, to, calibrate, secondary, standards, through, mechanical, comparators, metrological, traceability, is, defined, as, the, property, of, a, measurement, result, whereby, the, result, can, be, related, to, a, reference, through, a, documented, unbroken, chain, of, calibrations, each, contributing, to, the, measurement, uncertainty, it, permits, the, comparison, of, measurements, whether, the, result, is, compared, to, the, previous, result, in, the, same, laboratory, a, measurement, result, a, year, ago, or, to, the, result, of, a, measurement, performed, anywhere, else, in, the, world, the, chain, of, traceability, allows, any, measurement, to, be, referenced, to, higher, levels, of, measurements, back, to, the, original, definition, of, the, unit, traceability, is, obtained, directly, through, calibration, establishing, the, relationship, between, an, indication, on, a, standard, traceable, measuring, instrument, and, the, value, of, the, comparator, or, comparative, measuring, instrument, the, process, will, determine, the, measurement, value, and, uncertainty, of, the, device, that, is, being, calibrated, the, comparator, and, create, a, traceability, link, to, the, measurement, standard, the, four, primary, reasons, for, calibrations, are, to, provide, traceability, to, ensure, that, the, instrument, or, standard, is, consistent, with, other, measurements, to, determine, accuracy, and, to, establish, reliability, traceability, works, as, a, pyramid, at, the, top, level, there, is, the, international, standards, which, beholds, the, world, s, standards, the, next, level, is, the, national, metrology, institutes, that, have, primary, standards, that, are, traceable, to, the, international, standards, the, national, metrology, institutes, standards, are, used, to, establish, a, traceable, link, to, local, laboratory, standards, these, laboratory, standards, are, then, used, to, establish, a, traceable, link, to, industry, and, testing, laboratories, through, these, subsequent, calibrations, between, national, metrology, institutes, calibration, laboratories, and, industry, and, testing, laboratories, the, realisation, of, the, unit, definition, is, propagated, down, through, the, pyramid, the, traceability, chain, works, upwards, from, the, bottom, of, the, pyramid, where, measurements, done, by, industry, and, testing, laboratories, can, be, directly, related, to, the, unit, definition, at, the, top, through, the, traceability, chain, created, by, calibration, measurement, uncertainty, is, a, value, associated, with, a, measurement, which, expresses, the, spread, of, possible, values, associated, with, the, measurand, a, quantitative, expression, of, the, doubt, existing, in, the, measurement, there, are, two, components, to, the, uncertainty, of, a, measurement, the, width, of, the, uncertainty, interval, and, the, confidence, level, the, uncertainty, interval, is, a, range, of, values, that, the, measurement, value, expected, to, fall, within, while, the, confidence, level, is, how, likely, the, true, value, is, to, fall, within, the, uncertainty, interval, uncertainty, is, generally, expressed, as, follows, where, y, is, the, measurement, value, and, u, is, the, uncertainty, value, and, k, is, the, coverage, factor, indicates, the, confidence, interval, the, upper, and, lower, limit, of, the, uncertainty, interval, can, be, determined, by, adding, and, subtracting, the, uncertainty, value, from, the, measurement, value, the, coverage, factor, of, k, 2, generally, indicates, a, 95, confidence, that, the, measured, value, will, fall, inside, the, uncertainty, interval, other, values, of, k, can, be, used, to, indicate, a, greater, or, lower, confidence, on, the, interval, for, example, k, 1, and, k, 3, generally, indicate, 66, and, 99, 7, confidence, respectively, the, uncertainty, value, is, determined, through, a, combination, of, statistical, analysis, of, the, calibration, and, uncertainty, contribution, from, other, errors, in, measurement, process, which, can, be, evaluated, from, sources, such, as, the, instrument, history, manufacturer, s, specifications, or, published, information, several, international, organizations, maintain, and, standardise, metrology, the, metre, convention, created, three, main, international, organizations, to, facilitate, standardisation, of, weights, and, measures, the, first, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, provided, a, forum, for, representatives, of, member, states, the, second, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, was, an, advisory, committee, of, metrologists, of, high, standing, the, third, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, provided, secretarial, and, laboratory, facilities, for, the, cgpm, and, cipm, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, french, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, or, cgpm, is, the, convention, s, principal, decision, making, body, consisting, of, delegates, from, member, states, and, non, voting, observers, from, associate, states, the, conference, usually, meets, every, four, to, six, years, to, receive, and, discuss, a, cipm, report, and, endorse, new, developments, in, the, si, as, advised, by, the, cipm, the, last, meeting, was, held, on, 13, 16, november, 2018, on, the, last, day, of, this, conference, there, was, vote, on, the, redefinition, of, four, base, units, which, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, had, proposed, earlier, that, year, the, new, definitions, came, into, force, on, 20, may, 2019, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, french, comit, international, des, poids, et, mesures, or, cipm, is, made, up, of, eighteen, originally, fourteen, individuals, from, a, member, state, of, high, scientific, standing, nominated, by, the, cgpm, to, advise, the, cgpm, on, administrative, and, technical, matters, it, is, responsible, for, ten, consultative, committees, ccs, each, of, which, investigates, a, different, aspect, of, metrology, one, cc, discusses, the, measurement, of, temperature, another, the, measurement, of, mass, and, so, forth, the, cipm, meets, annually, in, s, vres, to, discuss, reports, from, the, ccs, to, submit, an, annual, report, to, the, governments, of, member, states, concerning, the, administration, and, finances, of, the, bipm, and, to, advise, the, cgpm, on, technical, matters, as, needed, each, member, of, the, cipm, is, from, a, different, member, state, with, france, in, recognition, of, its, role, in, establishing, the, convention, always, having, one, seat, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, french, bureau, international, des, poids, et, mesures, or, bipm, is, an, organisation, based, in, s, vres, france, which, has, custody, of, the,

prototypes, of, the, metre, and, of, the, kilogram, have, been, returned, to, bipm, headquarters, for, recalibration, the, bipm, director, is, an, ex, officio, member, of, the, cipm, and, a, member, of, all, consultative, committees, the, international, organization, of, legal, metrology, french, organisation, internationale, de, m, trologie, l, gale, or, oiml, is, an, intergovernmental, organization, created, in, 1955, to, promote, the, global, harmonisation, of, the, legal, metrology, procedures, facilitating, international, trade, this, harmonisation, of, technical, requirements, test, procedures, and, test, report, formats, ensure, confidence, in, measurements, for, trade, and, reduces, the, costs, of, discrepancies, and, measurement, duplication, the, oiml, publishes, a, number, of, international, reports, in, four, categories, although, the, oiml, has, no, legal, authority, to, impose, its, recommendations, and, guidelines, on, its, member, countries, it, provides, a, standardised, legal, framework, for, those, countries, to, assist, the, development, of, appropriate, harmonised, legislation, for, certification, and, calibration, oiml, provides, a, mutual, acceptance, arrangement, maa, for, measuring, instruments, that, are, subject, to, legal, metrological, control, which, upon, approval, allows, the, evaluation, and, test, reports, of, the,
