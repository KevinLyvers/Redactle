stainless, steel, also, known, as, inox, corrosion, resistant, steel, cres, and, rustless, steel, is, an, alloy, of, iron, that, is, resistant, to, rusting, and, corrosion, it, contains, iron, with, chromium, and, other, elements, such, as, molybdenum, carbon, nickel, and, nitrogen, depending, on, its, specific, use, and, cost, stainless, steel, s, resistance, to, corrosion, results, from, the, 10, 5, or, more, chromium, content, which, forms, a, passive, film, that, can, protect, the, material, and, self, heal, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, 3, the, alloy, s, properties, such, as, luster, and, resistance, to, corrosion, are, useful, in, many, applications, stainless, steel, can, be, rolled, into, sheets, plates, bars, wire, and, tubing, these, can, be, used, in, cookware, cutlery, surgical, instruments, major, appliances, vehicles, construction, material, in, large, buildings, industrial, equipment, e, g, in, paper, mills, chemical, plants, water, treatment, and, storage, tanks, and, tankers, for, chemicals, and, food, products, some, grades, are, also, suitable, for, forging, and, casting, the, biological, cleanability, of, stainless, steel, is, superior, to, both, aluminium, and, copper, and, comparable, to, glass, its, cleanability, strength, and, corrosion, resistance, have, prompted, the, use, of, stainless, steel, in, pharmaceutical, and, food, processing, plants, different, types, of, stainless, steel, are, labeled, with, an, aisi, three, digit, number, the, iso, 15510, standard, lists, the, chemical, compositions, of, stainless, steels, of, the, specifications, in, existing, iso, astm, en, jis, and, gb, standards, in, a, useful, interchange, table, although, stainless, steel, does, rust, this, only, affects, the, outer, few, layers, of, atoms, its, chromium, content, shielding, deeper, layers, from, oxidation, the, addition, of, nitrogen, also, improves, resistance, to, pitting, corrosion, and, increases, mechanical, strength, thus, there, are, numerous, grades, of, stainless, steel, with, varying, chromium, and, molybdenum, contents, to, suit, the, environment, the, alloy, must, endure, corrosion, resistance, can, be, increased, further, by, the, following, means, the, most, common, type, of, stainless, steel, 304, has, a, tensile, yield, strength, around, 210, mpa, 30, 000, psi, in, the, annealed, condition, it, can, be, strengthened, by, cold, working, to, a, strength, of, 1, 050, mpa, 153, 000, psi, in, the, full, hard, condition, the, strongest, commonly, available, stainless, steels, are, precipitation, hardening, alloys, such, as, 17, 4, ph, and, custom, 465, these, can, be, heat, treated, to, have, tensile, yield, strengths, up, to, 1, 730, mpa, 251, 000, psi, stainless, steel, is, a, steel, and, as, such, its, melting, point, is, near, that, of, ordinary, steel, and, much, higher, than, the, melting, points, of, aluminium, or, copper, as, with, most, alloys, the, melting, point, of, stainless, steel, is, expressed, in, the, form, of, a, range, of, temperatures, and, not, a, single, temperature, this, temperature, range, goes, from, 1, 400, to, 1, 530, c, 2, 550, to, 2, 790, f, 1, 670, to, 1, 800, k, 3, 010, to, 3, 250, r, depending, on, the, specific, consistency, of, the, alloy, in, question, like, steel, stainless, steels, are, relatively, poor, conductors, of, electricity, with, significantly, lower, electrical, conductivities, than, copper, in, particular, the, non, electrical, contact, resistance, ecr, of, stainless, steel, arises, as, a, result, of, the, dense, protective, oxide, layer, and, limits, its, functionality, in, applications, as, electrical, connectors, copper, alloys, and, nickel, coated, connectors, tend, to, exhibit, lower, ecr, values, and, are, preferred, materials, for, such, applications, nevertheless, stainless, steel, connectors, are, employed, in, situations, where, ecr, poses, a, lower, design, criteria, and, corrosion, resistance, is, required, for, example, in, high, temperatures, and, oxidizing, environments, martensitic, duplex, and, ferritic, stainless, steels, are, magnetic, while, austenitic, stainless, steel, is, usually, non, magnetic, ferritic, steel, owes, its, magnetism, to, its, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, in, which, iron, atoms, are, arranged, in, cubes, with, one, iron, atom, at, each, corner, and, an, additional, iron, atom, in, the, center, this, central, iron, atom, is, responsible, for, ferritic, steel, s, magnetic, properties, this, arrangement, also, limits, the, amount, of, carbon, the, steel, can, absorb, to, around, 0, 025, grades, with, low, coercive, field, have, been, developed, for, electro, valves, used, in, household, appliances, and, for, injection, systems, in, internal, combustion, engines, some, applications, require, non, magnetic, materials, such, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, austenitic, stainless, steels, which, are, usually, non, magnetic, can, be, made, slightly, magnetic, through, work, hardening, sometimes, if, austenitic, steel, is, bent, or, cut, magnetism, occurs, along, the, edge, of, the, stainless, steel, because, the, crystal, structure, rearranges, itself, galling, sometimes, called, cold, welding, is, a, form, of, severe, adhesive, wear, which, can, occur, when, two, metal, surfaces, are, in, relative, motion, to, each, other, and, under, heavy, pressure, austenitic, stainless, steel, fasteners, are, particularly, susceptible, to, thread, galling, though, other, alloys, that, self, generate, a, protective, oxide, surface, film, such, as, aluminum, and, titanium, are, also, susceptible, under, high, contact, force, sliding, this, oxide, can, be, deformed, broken, and, removed, from, parts, of, the, component, exposing, the, bare, reactive, metal, when, the, two, surfaces, are, of, the, same, material, these, exposed, surfaces, can, easily, fuse, separation, of, the, two, surfaces, can, result, in, surface, tearing, and, even, complete, seizure, of, metal, components, or, fasteners, galling, can, be, mitigated, by, the, use, of, dissimilar, materials, bronze, against, stainless, steel, or, using, different, stainless, steels, martensitic, against, austenitic, additionally, threaded, joints, may, be, lubricated, to, provide, a, film, between, the, two, parts, and, prevent, galling, nitronic, 60, made, by, selective, alloying, with, manganese, silicon, and, nitrogen, has, demonstrated, a, reduced, tendency, to, gall, the, density, of, stainless, steel, ranges, from, 7, 5, to, 8, 0, g, cm, 3, 0, 27, to, 0, 29, lb, cu, in, depending, on, the, alloy, the, invention, of, stainless, steel, followed, a, series, of, scientific, developments, starting, in, 1798, when, chromium, was, first, shown, to, the, french, academy, by, louis, vauquelin, in, the, early, 1800s, british, scientists, james, stoddart, michael, faraday, and, robert, mallet, observed, the, resistance, of, chromium, iron, alloys, chromium, steels, to, oxidizing, agents, robert, bunsen, discovered, chromium, s, resistance, to, strong, acids, the, corrosion, resistance, of, iron, chromium, alloys, may, have, been, first, recognized, in, 1821, by, pierre, berthier, who, noted, their, resistance, against, attack, by, some, acids, and, suggested, their, use, in, cutlery, in, the, 1840s, both, britain, s, sheffield, steelmakers, and, then, krupp, of, germany, were, producing, chromium, steel, with, the, latter, employing, it, for, cannons, in, the, 1850s, in, 1861, robert, forester, mushet, took, out, a, patent, on, chromium, steel, in, britain, these, events, led, to, the, first, american, production, of, chromium, containing, steel, by, j, baur, of, the, chrome, steel, works, of, brooklyn, for, the, construction, of, bridges, a, us, patent, for, the, product, was, issued, in, 1869, 2261, this, was, followed, with, recognition, of, the, corrosion, resistance, of, chromium, alloys, by, englishmen, john, t, woods, and, john, clark, who, noted, ranges, of, chromium, from, 5, 30, with, added, tungsten, and, medium, carbon, they, pursued, the, commercial, value, of, the, innovation, via, a, british, patent, for, weather, resistant, alloys, 261, 11, scientists, researching, steel, corrosion, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, didn, t, pay, attention, to, the, amount, of, carbon, in, the, alloyed, steels, they, were, testing, until, in, 1898, adolphe, carnot, and, e, goutal, noted, that, chromium, steels, better, resist, to, oxidation, with, acids, the, less, carbon, they, contain, also, in, the, late, 1890s, german, chemist, hans, goldschmidt, developed, an, aluminothermic, thermite, process, for, producing, carbon, free, chromium, between, 1904, and, 1911, several, researchers, particularly, leon, guillet, of, france, prepared, alloys, that, would, be, considered, stainless, steel, today, in, 1908, the, essen, firm, friedrich, krupp, germaniawerft, built, the, 366, ton, sailing, yacht, germania, featuring, a, chrome, nickel, steel, hull, in, germany, in, 1911, philip, monnartz, reported, on, the, relationship, between, chromium, content, and, corrosion, resistance, on, 17, october, 1912, krupp, engineers, benno, strauss, and, eduard, maurer, patented, as, nirosta, the, austenitic, stainless, steel, known, today, as, 18, 8, or, aisi, type, 304, similar, developments, were, taking, place, in, the, united, states, where, christian, dantsizen, of, general, electric, and, frederick, becket, 1875, 1942, at, union, carbide, were, industrializing, ferritic, stainless, steel, in, 1912, elwood, haynes, applied, for, a, us, patent, on, a, martensitic, stainless, steel, alloy, which, was, not, granted, until, 1919, while, seeking, a, corrosion, resistant, alloy, for, gun, barrels, in, 1912, harry, brearley, of, the, brown, firth, research, laboratory, in, sheffield, england, discovered, and, subsequently, industrialized, a, martensitic, stainless, steel, alloy, today, known, as, aisi, type, 420, the, discovery, was, announced, two, years, later, in, a, january, 1915, newspaper, article, in, the, new, york, times, the, metal, was, later, marketed, under, the, staybrite, brand, by, firth, vickers, in, england, and, was, used, for, the, new, entrance, canopy, for, the, savoy, hotel, in, london, in, 1929, brearley, applied, for, a, us, patent, during, 1915, only, to, find, that, haynes, had, already, registered, one, brearley, and, haynes, pooled, their, funding, and, with, a, group, of, investors, formed, the, american, stainless, steel, corporation, with, headquarters, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, 360, brearley, initially, called, his, new, alloy, rustless, steel, the, alloy, was, sold, in, the, us, under, different, brand, names, like, allegheny, metal, and, nirosta, steel, even, within, the, metallurgy, industry, the, name, remained, unsettled, in, 1921, one, trade, journal, called, it, unstainable, steel, brearley, worked, with, a, local, cutlery, manufacturer, who, gave, it, the, name, stainless, steel, as, late, as, 1932, ford, motor, company, continued, calling, the, alloy, rustless, steel, in, automobile, promotional, materials, in, 1929, before, the, great, depression, over, 25, 000, tons, of, stainless, steel, were, manufactured, and, sold, in, the, us, annually, major, technological, advances, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, allowed, the, production, of, large, tonnages, at, an, affordable, cost, stainless, steel, is, classified, into, five, main, families, that, are, primarily, differentiated, by, their, crystalline, structure, austenitic, stainless, steel, is, the, largest, family, of, stainless, steels, making, up, about, two, thirds, of, all, stainless, steel, production, they, possess, an, austenitic, microstructure, which, is, a, face, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, this, microstructure, is, achieved, by, alloying, steel, with, sufficient, nickel, and, or, manganese, and, nitrogen, to, maintain, an, austenitic, microstructure, at, all, temperatures, ranging, from, the, cryogenic, region, to, the, melting, point, thus, austenitic, stainless, steels, are, not, hardenable, by, heat, treatment, since, they, possess, the, same, microstructure, at, all, temperatures, however, forming, temperature, is, an, essential, factor, for, metastable, austenitic, stainless, steel, m, ass, products, to, accommodate, microstructures, and, cryogenic, mechanical, performance, metastable, austenitic, stainless, steels, m, asss, are, widely, used, in, manufacturing, cryogenic, pressure, vessels, cpvs, owing, to, their, high, cryogenic, toughness, ductility, strength, corrosion, resistance, and, economy, cryogenic, cold, forming, of, austenitic, stainless, steel, is, an, extension, of, the, heating, quenching, tempering, cycle, where, the, final, temperature, of, the, material, before, full, load, use, is, taken, down, to, a, cryogenic, temperature, range, this, can, remove, residual, stresses, and, improve, wear, resistance, austenitic, stainless, steel, sub, groups, 200, series, and, 300, series, ferritic, stainless, steels, possess, a, ferrite, microstructure, like, carbon, steel, which, is, a, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, and, contain, between, 10, 5, and, 27, chromium, with, very, little, or, no, nickel, this, microstructure, is, present, at, all, temperatures, due, to, the, chromium, addition, so, they, are, not, capable, of, being, hardened, by, heat, treatment, they, cannot, be, strengthened, by, cold, work, to, the, same, degree, as, austenitic, stainless, steels, they, are, magnetic, additions, of, niobium, nb, titanium, ti, and, zirconium, zr, to, type, 430, allow, good, weldability, due, to, the, near, absence, of, nickel, they, are, less, expensive, than, austenitic, steels, and, are, present, in, many, products, which, include, martensitic, stainless, steels, have, a, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, and, offer, a, wide, range, of, properties, and, are, used, as, stainless, engineering, steels, stainless, tool, steels, and, creep, resistant, steels, they, are, magnetic, and, not, as, corrosion, resistant, as, ferritic, and, austenitic, stainless, steels, due, to, their, low, chromium, content, they, fall, into, four, categories, with, some, overlap, martensitic, stainless, steels, can, be, heat, treated, to, provide, better, mechanical, properties, the, heat, treatment, typically, involves, three, steps, replacing, some, carbon, in, martensitic, stainless, steels, by, nitrogen, is, a, recent, development, the, limited, solubility, of, nitrogen, is, increased, by, the, pressure, electroslag, refining, pesr, process, in, which, melting, is, carried, out, under, high, nitrogen, pressure, steel, containing, up, to, 0, 4, nitrogen, has, been, achieved, leading, to, higher, hardness, and, strength, and, higher, corrosion, resistance, as, pesr, is, expensive, lower, but, significant, nitrogen, contents, have, been, achieved, using, the, standard, aod, process, duplex, stainless, steels, have, a, mixed, microstructure, of, austenite, and, ferrite, the, ideal, ratio, being, a, 50, 50, mix, though, commercial, alloys, may, have, ratios, of, 40, 60, they, are, characterized, by, higher, chromium, 19, 32, and, molybdenum, up, to, 5, and, lower, nickel, contents, than, austenitic, stainless, steels, duplex, stainless, steels, have, roughly, twice, the, yield, strength, of, austenitic, stainless, steel, their, mixed, microstructure, provides, improved, resistance, to, chloride, stress, corrosion, cracking, in, comparison, to, austenitic, stainless, steel, types, 304, and, 316, duplex, grades, are, usually, divided, into, three, sub, groups, based, on, their, corrosion, resistance, lean, duplex, standard, duplex, and, super, duplex, the, properties, of, duplex, stainless, steels, are, achieved, with, an, overall, lower, alloy, content, than, similar, performing, super, austenitic, grades, making, their, use, cost, effective, for, many, applications, the, pulp, and, paper, industry, was, one, of, the, first, to, extensively, use, duplex, stainless, steel, today, the, oil, and, gas, industry, is, the, largest, user, and, has, pushed, for, more, corrosion, resistant, grades, leading, to, the, development, of, super, duplex, and, hyper, duplex, grades, more, recently, the, less, expensive, and, slightly, less, corrosion, resistant, lean, duplex, has, been, developed, chiefly, for, structural, applications, in, building, and, construction, concrete, reinforcing, bars, plates, for, bridges, coastal, works, and, in, the, water, industry, precipitation, hardening, stainless, steels, have, corrosion, resistance, comparable, to, austenitic, varieties, but, can, be, precipitation, hardened, to, even, higher, strengths, than, other, martensitic, grades, there, are, three, types, of, precipitation, hardening, stainless, steels, solution, treatment, at, about, 1, 040, c, 1, 900, f, followed, by, quenching, results, in, a, relatively, ductile, martensitic, structure, subsequent, aging, treatment, at, 475, c, 887, f, precipitates, nb, and, cu, rich, phases, that, increase, the, strength, up, to, above, 1, 000, mpa, 150, 000, psi, yield, strength, this, outstanding, strength, level, is, used, in, high, tech, applications, such, as, aerospace, usually, after, remelting, to, eliminate, non, metallic, inclusions, which, increases, fatigue, life, another, major, advantage, of, this, steel, is, that, aging, unlike, tempering, treatments, is, carried, out, at, a, temperature, that, can, be, applied, to, nearly, finished, parts, without, distortion, and, discoloration, typical, heat, treatment, involves, solution, treatment, and, quenching, at, this, point, the, structure, remains, austenitic, martensitic, transformation, is, then, obtained, either, by, a, cryogenic, treatment, at, 75, c, 103, f, or, by, severe, cold, work, over, 70, deformation, usually, by, cold, rolling, or, wire, drawing, aging, at, 510, c, 950, f, which, precipitates, the, ni, 3, al, intermetallic, phase, is, carried, out, as, above, on, nearly, finished, parts, yield, stress, levels, above, 1400, mpa, are, then, reached, the, structure, remains, austenitic, at, all, temperatures, typical, heat, treatment, involves, solution, treatment, and, quenching, followed, by, aging, at, 715, c, 1, 319, f, aging, forms, ni, 3, ti, precipitates, and, increases, the, yield, strength, to, about, 650, mpa, 94, 000, psi, at, room, temperature, unlike, the, above, grades, the, mechanical, properties, and, creep, resistance, of, this, steel, remain, very, good, at, temperatures, up, to, 700, c, 1, 300, f, as, a, result, a286, is, classified, as, an, fe, based, superalloy, used, in, jet, engines, gas, turbines, and, turbo, parts, over, 150, grades, of, stainless, steel, are, recognized, of, which, 15, are, the, most, widely, used, many, grading, systems, are, in, use, including, us, sae, steel, grades, the, unified, numbering, system, for, metals, and, alloys, uns, was, developed, by, the, astm, in, 1970, europe, has, adopted, en, 10088, unlike, carbon, steel, stainless, steels, do, not, suffer, uniform, corrosion, when, exposed, to, wet, environments, unprotected, carbon, steel, rusts, readily, when, exposed, to, a, combination, of, air, and, moisture, the, resulting, iron, oxide, surface, layer, is, porous, and, fragile, in, addition, as, iron, oxide, occupies, a, larger, volume, than, the, original, steel, this, layer, expands, and, tends, to, flake, and, fall, away, exposing, the, underlying, steel, to, further, attack, in, comparison, stainless, steels, contain, sufficient, chromium, to, undergo, passivation, spontaneously, forming, a, microscopically, thin, inert, surface, film, of, chromium, oxide, by, reaction, with, the, oxygen, in, the, air, and, even, the, small, amount, of, dissolved, oxygen, in, the, water, this, passive, film, prevents, further, corrosion, by, blocking, oxygen, diffusion, to, the, steel, surface, and, thus, prevents, corrosion, from, spreading, into, the, bulk, of, the, metal, this, film, is, self, repairing, even, when, scratched, or, temporarily, disturbed, by, conditions, that, exceed, the, inherent, corrosion, resistance, of, that, grade, the, resistance, of, this, film, to, corrosion, depends, upon, the, chemical, composition, of, the, stainless, steel, chiefly, the, chromium, content, it, is, customary, to, distinguish, between, four, forms, of, corrosion, uniform, localized, pitting, galvanic, and, scc, stress, corrosion, cracking, any, of, these, forms, of, corrosion, can, occur, when, the, grade, of, stainless, steel, is, not, suited, for, the, working, environment, the, designation, cres, refers, to, corrosion, resistant, stainless, steel, uniform, corrosion, takes, place, in, very, aggressive, environments, typically, where, chemicals, are, produced, or, heavily, used, such, as, in, the, pulp, and, paper, industries, the, entire, surface, of, the, steel, is, attacked, and, the, corrosion, is, expressed, as, corrosion, rate, in, mm, year, usually, less, than, 0, 1, mm, year, is, acceptable, for, such, cases, corrosion, tables, provide, guidelines, this, is, typically, the, case, when, stainless, steels, are, exposed, to, acidic, or, basic, solutions, whether, stainless, steel, corrodes, depends, on, the, kind, and, concentration, of, acid, or, base, and, the, solution, temperature, uniform, corrosion, is, typically, easy, to, avoid, because, of, extensive, published, corrosion, data, or, easily, performed, laboratory, corrosion, testing, acidic, solutions, can, be, put, into, two, general, categories, reducing, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, and, dilute, sulfuric, acid, and, oxidizing, acids, such, as, nitric, acid, and, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, increasing, chromium, and, molybdenum, content, provides, increased, resistance, to, reducing, acids, while, increasing, chromium, and, silicon, content, provides, increased, resistance, to, oxidizing, acids, sulfuric, acid, is, one, of, the, most, produced, industrial, chemicals, at, room, temperature, type, 304, stainless, steel, is, only, resistant, to, 3, acid, while, type, 316, is, resistant, to, 3, acid, up, to, 50, c, 120, f, and, 20, acid, at, room, temperature, thus, type, 304, ss, is, rarely, used, in, contact, with, sulfuric, acid, type, 904l, and, alloy, 20, are, resistant, to, sulfuric, acid, at, even, higher, concentrations, above, room, temperature, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, possesses, oxidizing, characteristics, like, nitric, acid, and, thus, silicon, bearing, stainless, steels, are, also, useful, hydrochloric, acid, damages, any, kind, of, stainless, steel, and, should, be, avoided, 118, all, types, of, stainless, steel, resist, attack, from, phosphoric, acid, and, nitric, acid, at, room, temperature, at, high, concentrations, and, elevated, temperatures, attack, will, occur, and, higher, alloy, stainless, steels, are, required, in, general, organic, acids, are, less, corrosive, than, mineral, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, and, sulfuric, acid, type, 304, and, type, 316, stainless, steels, are, unaffected, by, weak, bases, such, as, ammonium, hydroxide, even, in, high, concentrations, and, at, high, temperatures, the, same, grades, exposed, to, stronger, bases, such, as, sodium, hydroxide, at, high, concentrations, and, high, temperatures, will, likely, experience, some, etching, and, cracking, increasing, chromium, and, nickel, contents, provide, increased, resistance, all, grades, resist, damage, from, aldehydes, and, amines, though, in, the, latter, case, type, 316, is, preferable, to, type, 304, cellulose, acetate, damages, type, 304, unless, the, temperature, is, kept, low, fats, and, fatty, acids, only, affect, type, 304, at, temperatures, above, 150, c, 300, f, and, type, 316, ss, above, 260, c, 500, f, while, type, 317, ss, is, unaffected, at, all, temperatures, type, 316l, is, required, for, the, processing, of, urea, localized, corrosion, can, occur, in, several, ways, e, g, pitting, corrosion, and, crevice, corrosion, these, localized, attacks, are, most, common, in, the, presence, of, chloride, ions, higher, chloride, levels, require, more, highly, alloyed, stainless, steels, localized, corrosion, can, be, difficult, to, predict, because, it, is, dependent, on, many, factors, including, pitting, corrosion, is, considered, the, most, common, form, of, localized, corrosion, the, corrosion, resistance, of, stainless, steels, to, pitting, corrosion, is, often, expressed, by, the, pren, obtained, through, the, formula, where, the, terms, correspond, to, the, proportion, of, the, contents, by, mass, of, chromium, molybdenum, and, nitrogen, in, the, steel, for, example, if, the, steel, consisted, of, 15, chromium, cr, would, be, equal, to, 15, the, higher, the, pren, the, higher, the, pitting, corrosion, resistance, thus, increasing, chromium, molybdenum, and, nitrogen, contents, provide, better, resistance, to, pitting, corrosion, though, the, pren, of, certain, steel, may, be, theoretically, sufficient, to, resist, pitting, corrosion, crevice, corrosion, can, still, occur, when, the, poor, design, has, created, confined, areas, overlapping, plates, washer, plate, interfaces, etc, or, when, deposits, form, on, the, material, in, these, select, areas, the, pren, may, not, be, high, enough, for, the, service, conditions, good, design, fabrication, techniques, alloy, selection, proper, operating, conditions, based, on, the, concentration, of, active, compounds, present, in, the, solution, causing, corrosion, ph, etc, can, prevent, such, corrosion, stress, corrosion, cracking, scc, is, a, sudden, cracking, and, failure, of, a, component, without, deformation, it, may, occur, when, three, conditions, are, met, the, scc, mechanism, results, from, the, following, sequence, of, events, whereas, pitting, usually, leads, to, unsightly, surfaces, and, at, worst, to, perforation, of, the, stainless, sheet, failure, by, scc, can, have, severe, consequences, it, is, therefore, considered, as, a, special, form, of, corrosion, as, scc, requires, several, conditions, to, be, met, it, can, be, counteracted, with, relatively, easy, measures, including, galvanic, corrosion, also, called, dissimilar, metal, corrosion, refers, to, corrosion, damage, induced, when, two, dissimilar, materials, are, coupled, in, a, corrosive, electrolyte, the, most, common, electrolyte, is, water, ranging, from, freshwater, to, seawater, when, a, galvanic, couple, forms, one, of, the, metals, in, the, couple, becomes, the, anode, and, corrodes, faster, than, it, would, alone, while, the, other, becomes, the, cathode, and, corrodes, slower, than, it, would, alone, stainless, steel, due, to, having, a, more, positive, electrode, potential, than, for, example, carbon, steel, and, aluminium, becomes, the, cathode, accelerating, the, corrosion, of, the, anodic, metal, an, example, is, the, corrosion, of, aluminium, rivets, fastening, stainless, steel, sheets, in, contact, with, water, the, relative, surface, areas, of, the, anode, and, the, cathode, are, important, in, determining, the, rate, of, corrosion, in, the, above, example, the, surface, area, of, the, rivets, is, small, compared, to, that, of, the, stainless, steel, sheet, resulting, in, rapid, corrosion, however, if, stainless, steel, fasteners, are, used, to, assemble, aluminium, sheets, galvanic, corrosion, will, be, much, slower, because, the, galvanic, current, density, on, the, aluminium, surface, will, be, many, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, a, frequent, mistake, is, to, assemble, stainless, steel, plates, with, carbon, steel, fasteners, whereas, using, stainless, steel, to, fasten, carbon, steel, plates, is, usually, acceptable, the, reverse, is, not, providing, electrical, insulation, between, the, dissimilar, metals, where, possible, is, effective, at, preventing, this, type, of, corrosion, at, elevated, temperatures, all, metals, react, with, hot, gases, the, most, common, high, temperature, gaseous, mixture, is, air, of, which, oxygen, is, the, most, reactive, component, to, avoid, corrosion, in, air, carbon, steel, is, limited, to, approximately, 480, c, 900, f, oxidation, resistance, in, stainless, steels, increases, with, additions, of, chromium, silicon, and, aluminium, small, additions, of, cerium, and, yttrium, increase, the, adhesion, of, the, oxide, layer, on, the, surface, the, addition, of, chromium, remains, the, most, common, method, to, increase, high, temperature, corrosion, resistance, in, stainless, steels, chromium, reacts, with, oxygen, to, form, a, chromium, oxide, scale, which, reduces, oxygen, diffusion, into, the, material, the, minimum, 10, 5, chromium, in, stainless, steels, provides, resistance, to, approximately, 700, c, 1, 300, f, while, 16, chromium, provides, resistance, up, to, approximately, 1, 200, c, 2, 200, f, type, 304, the, most, common, grade, of, stainless, steel, with, 18, chromium, is, resistant, to, approximately, 870, c, 1, 600, f, other, gases, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, hydrogen, sulfide, carbon, monoxide, chlorine, also, attack, stainless, steel, resistance, to, other, gases, is, dependent, on, the, type, of, gas, the, temperature, and, the, alloying, content, of, the, stainless, steel, with, the, addition, of, up, to, 5, aluminium, ferritic, grades, fe, cr, al, are, designed, for, electrical, resistance, and, oxidation, resistance, at, elevated, temperatures, such, alloys, include, kanthal, produced, in, the, form, of, wire, or, ribbons, standard, mill, finishes, can, be, applied, to, flat, rolled, stainless, steel, directly, by, the, rollers, and, by, mechanical, abrasives, steel, is, first, rolled, to, size, and, thickness, and, then, annealed, to, change, the, properties, of, the, final, material, any, oxidation, that, forms, on, the, surface, mill, scale, is, removed, by, pickling, and, a, passivation, layer, is, created, on, the, surface, a, final, finish, can, then, be, applied, to, achieve, the, desired, aesthetic, appearance, the, following, designations, are, used, in, the, u, s, to, describe, stainless, steel, finishes, by, astm, a480, a480m, 18, din, a, wide, range, of, joining, processes, are, available, for, stainless, steels, though, welding, is, by, far, the, most, common, the, ease, of, welding, largely, depends, on, the, type, of, stainless, steel, used, austenitic, stainless, steels, are, the, easiest, to, weld, by, electric, arc, with, weld, properties, similar, to, those, of, the, base, metal, not, cold, worked, martensitic, stainless, steels, can, also, be, welded, by, electric, arc, but, as, the, heat, affected, zone, haz, and, the, fusion, zone, fz, form, martensite, upon, cooling, precautions, must, be, taken, to, avoid, cracking, of, the, weld, improper, welding, practices, can, additionally, cause, sugaring, oxide, scaling, and, or, heat, tint, on, the, backside, of, the, weld, this, can, be, prevented, with, the, use, of, back, purging, gases, backing, plates, and, fluxes, post, weld, heat, treatment, is, almost, always, required, while, preheating, before, welding, is, also, necessary, in, some, cases, electric, arc, welding, of, type, 430, ferritic, stainless, steel, results, in, grain, growth, in, the, haz, which, leads, to, brittleness, this, has, largely, been, overcome, with, stabilized, ferritic, grades, where, niobium, titanium, and, zirconium, form, precipitates, that, prevent, grain, growth, duplex, stainless, steel, welding, by, electric, arc, is, a, common, practice, but, requires, careful, control, of, the, process, parameters, otherwise, the, precipitation, of, unwanted, intermetallic, phases, occurs, which, reduces, the, toughness, of, the, welds, electric, arc, welding, processes, include, mig, mag, and, tig, welding, are, the, most, common, methods, other, welding, processes, include, stainless, steel, may, be, bonded, with, adhesives, such, as, silicone, silyl, modified, polymers, and, epoxies, acrylic, and, polyurethane, adhesives, are, also, used, in, some, situations, most, of, the, world, s, stainless, steel, production, is, produced, by, the, following, processes, world, stainless, steel, production, figures, are, published, yearly, by, the, international, stainless, steel, forum, of, the, eu, production, figures, italy, belgium, and, spain, were, notable, while, canada, and, mexico, produced, none, china, japan, south, korea, taiwan, india, the, us, and, indonesia, were, large, producers, while, russia, reported, little, production, breakdown, of, production, by, stainless, steels, families, in, 2017, stainless, steel, is, used, in, a, multitude, of, fields, including, architecture, art, chemical, engineering, food, and, beverage, manufacture, vehicles, medicine, energy, and, firearms, life, cycle, cost, lcc, calculations, are, used, to, select, the, design, and, the, materials, that, will, lead, to, the, lowest, cost, over, the, whole, life, of, a, project, such, as, a, building, or, a, bridge, the, formula, in, a, simple, form, is, the, following, where, lcc, is, the, overall, life, cycle, cost, ac, is, the, acquisition, cost, ic, the, installation, cost, oc, the, operating, and, maintenance, costs, lp, the, cost, of, lost, production, due, to, downtime, and, rc, the, replacement, materials, cost, in, addition, n, is, the, planned, life, of, the, project, i, the, interest, rate, and, n, the, year, in, which, a, particular, oc, or, lp, or, rc, is, taking, place, the, interest, rate, i, is, used, to, convert, expenses, from, different, years, to, their, present, value, a, method, widely, used, by, banks, and, insurance, companies, so, they, can, be, added, and, compared, fairly, the, usage, of, the, sum, formula, textstyle, sum, captures, the, fact, that, expenses, over, the, lifetime, of, a, project, must, be, cumulated, after, they, are, corrected, for, interest, rate, application, of, lcc, in, materials, selection, stainless, steel, used, in, projects, often, results, in, lower, lcc, values, compared, to, other, materials, the, higher, acquisition, cost, ac, of, stainless, steel, components, are, often, offset, by, improvements, in, operating, and, maintenance, costs, reduced, loss, of, production, lp, costs, and, the, higher, resale, value, of, stainless, steel, components, lcc, calculations, are, usually, limited, to, the, project, itself, however, there, may, be, other, costs, that, a, project, stakeholder, may, wish, to, consider, the, average, carbon, footprint, of, stainless, steel, all, grades, all, countries, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 90, kg, of, co, 2, per, kg, of, stainless, steel, produced, of, which, 1, 92, kg, are, emissions, from, raw, materials, cr, ni, mo, 0, 54, kg, from, electricity, and, steam, and, 0, 44, kg, are, direct, emissions, i, e, by, the, stainless, steel, plant, note, that, stainless, steel, produced, in, countries, that, use, cleaner, sources, of, electricity, such, as, france, which, uses, nuclear, energy, will, have, a, lower, carbon, footprint, ferritics, without, ni, will, have, a, lower, co, 2, footprint, than, austenitics, with, 8, ni, or, more, carbon, footprint, must, not, be, the, only, sustainability, related, factor, for, deciding, the, choice, of, materials, stainless, steel, is, 100, recyclable, an, average, stainless, steel, object, is, composed, of, about, 60, recycled, material, of, which, approximately, 40, originates, from, end, of, life, products, while, the, remaining, 60, comes, from, manufacturing, processes, what, prevents, a, higher, recycling, content, is, the, availability, of, stainless, steel, scrap, in, spite, of, a, very, high, recycling, rate, according, to, the, international, resource, panel, s, metal, stocks, in, society, report, the, per, capita, stock, of, stainless, steel, in, use, in, society, is, 80, to, 180, kg, 180, to, 400, lb, in, more, developed, countries, and, 15, kg, 33, lb, in, less, developed, countries, there, is, a, secondary, market, that, recycles, usable, scrap, for, many, stainless, steel, markets, the, product, is, mostly, coil, sheet, and, blanks, this, material, is, purchased, at, a, less, than, prime, price, and, sold, to, commercial, quality, stampers, and, sheet, metal, houses, the, material, may, have, scratches, pits, and, dents, but, is, made, to, the, current, specifications, the, stainless, steel, cycle, starts, with, carbon, steel, scrap, primary, metals, and, slag, the, next, step, is, the, production, of, hot, rolled, and, cold, finished, steel, products, in, steel, mills, some, scrap, is, produced, which, is, directly, reused, in, the, melting, shop, the, manufacturing, of, components, is, the, third, step, some, scrap, is, produced, and, enters, the, recycling, loop, assembly, of, final, goods, and, their, use, does, not, generate, any, material, loss, the, fourth, step, is, the, collection, of, stainless, steel, for, recycling, at, the, end, of, life, of, the, goods, such, as, kitchenware, pulp, and, paper, plants, or, automotive, parts, this, is, where, it, is, most, difficult, to, get, stainless, steel, to, enter, the, recycling, loop, as, shown, in, the, table, below, stainless, steel, nanoparticles, have, been, produced, in, the, laboratory, these, may, have, applications, as, additives, for, high, performance, applications, for, example, sulfurization, phosphorization, and, nitridation, treatments, to, produce, nanoscale, stainless, steel, based, catalysts, could, enhance, the, electrocatalytic, performance, of, stainless, steel, for, water, splitting, there, is, extensive, research, indicating, some, probable, increased, risk, of, cancer, particularly, lung, cancer, from, inhaling, fumes, while, welding, stainless, steel, stainless, steel, welding, is, suspected, of, producing, carcinogenic, fumes, from, cadmium, oxides, nickel, and, chromium, according, to, cancer, council, australia, in, 2017, all, types, of, welding, fumes, were, classified, as, a, group, 1, carcinogen, stainless, steel, is, generally, considered, to, be, biologically, inert, however, during, cooking, small, amounts, of, nickel, and, chromium, leach, out, of, new, stainless, steel, cookware, into, highly, acidic, food, nickel, can, contribute, to, cancer, risks, particularly, lung, cancer, and, nasal, cancer, however, no, connection, between, stainless, steel, cookware, and, cancer, has, been, established
