night, or, nighttime, is, the, period, of, darkness, when, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, the, opposite, of, nighttime, is, daytime, sunlight, illuminates, one, side, of, the, earth, leaving, the, other, in, darkness, earth, s, rotation, causes, the, appearance, of, sunrise, and, sunset, moonlight, airglow, starlight, and, light, pollution, dimly, illuminate, night, the, duration, of, day, night, and, twilight, varies, depending, on, the, time, of, year, and, the, latitude, night, on, other, celestial, bodies, is, affected, by, their, rotation, and, orbital, periods, the, planets, mercury, and, venus, have, much, longer, nights, than, earth, on, venus, night, lasts, 120, earth, days, the, moon, s, rotation, is, tidally, locked, rotating, so, that, one, of, the, sides, of, the, moon, always, faces, earth, nightfall, across, portions, of, the, near, side, of, the, moon, results, in, lunar, phases, visible, from, earth, organisms, respond, to, the, changes, brought, by, nightfall, including, darkness, increased, humidity, and, lower, temperatures, their, responses, include, direct, reactions, and, adjustments, to, circadian, rhythms, governed, by, an, internal, biological, clock, these, circadian, rhythms, regulated, by, exposure, to, light, and, darkness, affect, an, organism, s, behavior, and, physiology, animals, more, active, at, night, are, called, nocturnal, and, have, adaptations, for, low, light, including, different, forms, of, night, vision, and, the, heightening, of, other, senses, diurnal, animals, are, active, during, the, day, and, sleep, at, night, mammals, birds, and, some, others, dream, while, asleep, fungi, respond, directly, to, nightfall, and, increase, their, biomass, with, some, exceptions, fungi, do, not, rely, on, a, biological, clock, plants, store, energy, produced, through, photosynthesis, as, starch, granules, to, consume, at, night, algae, engage, in, a, similar, process, and, cyanobacteria, transition, from, photosynthesis, to, nitrogen, fixation, after, sunset, in, arid, environments, like, deserts, plants, evolved, to, be, more, active, at, night, with, many, gathering, carbon, dioxide, overnight, for, daytime, photosynthesis, night, blooming, cacti, rely, on, nocturnal, pollinators, such, as, bats, and, moths, for, reproduction, light, pollution, disrupts, the, patterns, in, ecosystems, and, is, especially, harmful, to, night, flying, insects, historically, night, has, been, a, time, of, increased, danger, and, insecurity, many, daytime, social, controls, dissipated, after, sunset, theft, fights, murders, taboo, sexual, activities, and, accidental, deaths, all, became, more, frequent, due, in, part, to, reduced, visibility, cultures, have, personified, night, through, deities, associated, with, some, or, all, of, these, aspects, of, nighttime, the, folklore, of, many, cultures, contains, creatures, of, the, night, including, werewolves, witches, ghosts, and, goblins, reflecting, societal, fears, and, anxieties, the, introduction, of, artificial, lighting, extended, daytime, activities, major, european, cities, hung, lanterns, housing, candles, and, oil, lamps, in, the, 1600s, nineteenth, century, gas, and, electric, lights, created, unprecedented, illumination, the, range, of, socially, acceptable, leisure, activities, expanded, and, various, industries, introduced, a, night, shift, nightlife, encompassing, bars, nightclubs, and, cultural, venues, has, become, a, significant, part, of, urban, culture, contributing, to, social, and, political, movements, a, planet, s, rotation, causes, nighttime, and, daytime, when, a, place, on, earth, is, pointed, away, from, the, sun, that, location, experiences, night, the, sun, appears, to, set, in, the, west, and, rise, in, the, east, due, to, earth, s, rotation, many, celestial, bodies, including, the, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, have, a, form, of, night, the, length, of, night, on, earth, varies, depending, on, the, time, of, year, longer, nights, occur, in, winter, with, the, winter, solstice, being, the, longest, nights, are, shorter, in, the, summer, with, the, summer, solstice, being, the, shortest, earth, orbits, the, sun, on, an, axis, tilted, 23, 44, degrees, nights, are, longer, when, a, hemisphere, is, tilted, away, from, the, sun, and, shorter, when, a, hemisphere, is, tilted, toward, the, sun, as, a, result, the, longest, night, of, the, year, for, the, northern, hemisphere, will, be, the, shortest, night, of, the, year, for, the, southern, hemisphere, night, s, duration, varies, least, near, the, equator, the, difference, between, the, shortest, and, longest, night, increases, approaching, the, poles, at, the, equator, night, lasts, roughly, 12, hours, throughout, the, year, the, tropics, have, little, difference, in, the, length, of, day, and, night, at, the, 45th, parallel, the, longest, winter, night, is, roughly, twice, as, long, as, the, shortest, summer, night, within, the, polar, circles, night, will, last, the, full, 24, hours, of, the, winter, solstice, the, length, of, this, polar, night, increases, closer, to, the, poles, utqiagvik, alaska, the, northernmost, point, in, the, united, states, experiences, 65, days, of, polar, night, at, the, pole, itself, polar, night, lasts, 179, days, from, september, to, march, over, a, year, there, is, more, daytime, than, nighttime, because, of, the, sun, s, size, and, atmospheric, refraction, the, sun, is, not, a, single, point, viewed, from, earth, the, sun, ranges, in, angular, diameter, from, 31, to, 33, arcminutes, when, the, center, of, the, sun, falls, level, with, the, western, horizon, half, of, the, sun, will, still, be, visible, during, sunset, likewise, by, the, time, the, center, of, the, sun, rises, to, the, eastern, horizon, half, of, the, sun, will, already, be, visible, during, sunrise, this, shortens, night, by, about, 3, minutes, in, temperate, zones, atmospheric, refraction, is, a, larger, factor, refraction, bends, sunlight, over, the, horizon, on, earth, the, sun, remains, briefly, visible, after, it, has, geometrically, fallen, below, the, horizon, this, shortens, night, by, about, 6, minutes, scattered, diffuse, sunlight, remains, in, the, sky, after, sunset, and, into, twilight, there, are, multiple, ways, to, define, twilight, the, gradual, transition, to, and, from, darkness, when, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, civil, twilight, occurs, when, the, sun, is, between, 0, and, 6, degrees, below, the, horizon, nearby, planets, like, venus, and, bright, stars, like, sirius, are, visible, during, this, period, nautical, twilight, continues, until, the, sun, is, 12, degrees, below, the, horizon, during, nautical, twilight, the, horizon, is, visible, enough, for, navigation, astronomical, twilight, continues, until, the, sun, has, sunk, 18, degrees, below, the, horizon, beyond, 18, degrees, refracted, sunlight, is, no, longer, visible, the, period, when, the, sun, is, 18, or, more, degrees, below, either, horizon, is, called, astronomical, night, similar, to, the, duration, of, night, itself, the, duration, of, twilight, varies, according, to, latitude, at, the, equator, day, quickly, transitions, to, night, while, the, transition, can, take, weeks, near, the, poles, the, duration, of, twilight, is, longest, at, the, summer, solstice, and, shortest, near, the, equinoxes, moonlight, starlight, airglow, and, light, pollution, create, the, skyglow, that, dimly, illuminates, nighttime, the, amount, of, skyglow, increases, each, year, due, to, artificial, lighting, night, exists, on, the, other, planets, and, moons, in, the, solar, system, the, length, of, night, is, affected, by, the, rotation, period, and, orbital, period, of, the, celestial, object, the, lunar, phases, visible, from, earth, result, from, nightfall, on, the, moon, the, moon, has, longer, nights, than, earth, lasting, about, two, weeks, this, is, half, of, the, synodic, lunar, month, the, time, it, takes, the, moon, to, cycle, through, its, phases, the, moon, is, tidally, locked, to, earth, it, rotates, so, that, one, side, of, the, moon, always, faces, the, earth, the, side, of, the, moon, facing, away, from, earth, is, called, the, far, side, of, the, moon, and, the, side, facing, earth, is, called, the, near, side, of, the, moon, during, lunar, night, on, the, near, side, earth, is, 50, times, brighter, than, a, full, moon, because, the, moon, has, no, atmosphere, there, is, an, abrupt, transition, from, day, to, night, without, twilight, night, varies, from, planet, to, planet, within, the, solar, system, mars, s, dusty, atmosphere, causes, a, lengthy, twilight, period, the, refracted, light, ranges, from, purple, to, blue, often, resulting, in, glowing, noctilucent, clouds, venus, and, mercury, have, long, nights, because, of, their, slow, rotational, periods, the, planet, venus, rotates, once, every, 243, earth, days, because, of, its, unusual, retrograde, rotation, nights, last, 116, 75, earth, days, the, dense, greenhouse, atmosphere, on, venus, keeps, its, surface, hot, enough, to, melt, lead, throughout, the, night, its, planetary, wind, system, driven, by, solar, heat, reverses, direction, from, day, to, night, venus, s, winds, flow, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, on, the, day, side, and, from, the, poles, to, the, equator, on, the, night, side, on, mercury, the, planet, closest, to, the, sun, the, temperature, drops, over, 1, 000, f, 538, c, after, nightfall, the, day, night, cycle, is, one, consideration, for, planetary, habitability, or, the, possibility, of, extraterrestrial, life, on, distant, exoplanets, in, general, shorter, nights, result, in, a, higher, equilibrium, temperature, for, the, planet, on, an, earth, like, planet, longer, day, night, cycles, may, increase, habitability, up, to, a, point, computer, models, show, that, longer, nights, would, affect, hadley, circulation, resulting, in, a, cooler, less, cloudy, planet, once, the, rotation, speed, of, a, planet, slows, beyond, 1, 16, that, of, earth, the, difference, in, day, to, night, temperature, shifts, increases, dramatically, some, exoplanets, like, those, of, trappist, 1, are, tidally, locked, tidally, locked, planets, have, equal, rotation, and, orbital, periods, so, one, side, experiences, constant, day, and, the, other, side, constant, night, in, these, situations, astrophysicists, believe, that, life, would, most, likely, develop, in, the, twilight, zone, between, the, day, and, night, hemispheres, living, organisms, react, directly, to, the, darkness, of, night, light, and, darkness, also, affect, circadian, rhythms, the, physical, and, mental, changes, that, occur, in, a, 24, hour, cycle, this, daily, cycle, is, regulated, by, an, internal, biological, clock, that, is, adjusted, by, exposure, to, light, the, length, and, timing, of, nighttime, depend, on, location, and, time, of, year, organisms, that, are, more, active, at, night, possess, adaptations, to, the, night, s, dimmer, light, increased, humidity, and, lower, temperatures, animals, that, are, active, primarily, at, night, are, called, nocturnal, and, usually, possess, adaptations, for, night, vision, in, vertebrates, eyes, two, types, of, photoreceptor, cells, sense, light, cone, cells, sense, color, but, are, ineffective, in, low, light, rod, cells, sense, only, brightness, but, remain, effective, in, very, dim, light, the, eyes, of, nocturnal, animals, have, a, greater, percentage, of, rod, cells, in, most, mammals, rod, cells, contain, densely, packed, dna, near, the, edge, of, the, nucleus, for, nocturnal, mammals, this, is, reversed, with, the, densely, packed, dna, in, the, center, of, the, nucleus, which, reduces, the, scattering, of, light, some, nocturnal, animals, have, a, mirror, the, tapetum, lucidum, behind, the, retina, this, doubles, the, amount, of, light, their, eyes, can, process, the, compound, eyes, of, insects, can, see, at, even, lower, levels, of, light, for, example, the, elephant, hawk, moth, can, see, in, color, including, ultraviolet, with, only, starlight, nocturnal, insects, navigate, using, moonlight, lunar, phases, infrared, vision, the, position, of, the, stars, and, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, artificial, lighting, disrupts, the, biorhythms, of, many, animals, night, flying, insects, that, use, the, moon, for, navigation, are, especially, vulnerable, to, disorientation, from, increasing, levels, of, artificial, lighting, artificial, lights, attract, many, night, flying, insects, that, die, from, exhaustion, and, nocturnal, predators, decreases, in, insect, populations, disrupt, the, overall, ecosystem, because, their, larvae, are, a, key, food, source, for, smaller, fish, dark, sky, advocate, paul, bogard, described, the, unnatural, migration, of, night, flying, insects, from, the, unlit, nevada, desert, into, las, vegas, as, like, sparkling, confetti, floating, in, the, beam, s, white, column, some, nocturnal, animals, have, developed, other, senses, to, compensate, for, limited, light, many, snakes, have, a, pit, organ, that, senses, infrared, light, and, enables, them, to, detect, heat, nocturnal, mice, possess, a, vomeronasal, organ, that, enhances, their, sense, of, smell, bats, heavily, depend, on, echolocation, echolocation, allows, an, animal, to, navigate, with, their, sense, of, hearing, by, emitting, sounds, and, listening, for, the, time, it, takes, them, to, bounce, back, bats, emit, a, steady, stream, of, clicks, while, hunting, insects, and, home, in, on, prey, as, thin, as, human, hair, people, and, other, diurnal, animals, sleep, primarily, at, night, humans, other, mammals, and, birds, experience, multiple, stages, of, sleep, visible, via, electroencephalography, the, stages, of, sleep, are, wakefulness, three, stages, of, non, rapid, eye, movement, sleep, nrem, including, deep, sleep, and, rapid, eye, movement, rem, sleep, during, rem, sleep, dreams, are, more, frequent, and, complex, studies, show, that, some, reptiles, may, also, experience, rem, sleep, during, deep, sleep, memories, are, consolidated, into, long, term, memory, invertebrates, most, likely, experience, a, form, of, sleep, as, well, studies, on, bees, which, have, complex, but, unrelated, brain, structures, have, shown, improvements, in, memory, after, sleep, similar, to, mammals, compared, to, waking, life, dreams, are, sparse, with, limited, sensory, detail, dreams, are, hallucinatory, or, bizarre, and, they, often, have, a, narrative, structure, many, hypotheses, exist, to, explain, the, function, of, dreams, without, a, definitive, answer, nightmares, are, dreams, that, cause, distress, the, word, night, mare, originally, referred, to, nocturnal, demons, that, were, believed, to, assail, sleeping, dreamers, like, the, incubus, male, or, succubus, female, it, was, believed, that, the, demons, could, sit, upon, a, dreamer, s, chest, to, suffocate, a, victim, as, depicted, in, john, henry, fuseli, s, the, nightmare, fungi, can, sense, the, presence, and, absence, of, light, and, the, nightly, changes, of, most, fungi, growth, and, biological, processes, are, direct, responses, to, either, darkness, or, falling, temperatures, by, night, fungi, are, more, engaged, in, synthesizing, cellular, components, and, increasing, their, biomass, for, example, fungi, that, preys, on, insects, will, infect, the, central, nervous, system, of, their, prey, allowing, the, fungi, to, control, the, actions, of, the, dying, insect, during, the, late, afternoon, the, fungi, will, pilot, their, prey, to, higher, elevation, where, wind, currents, can, carry, its, spores, further, the, fungi, will, kill, and, digest, the, insect, as, night, falls, extending, fruiting, bodies, from, the, host, s, exoskeleton, few, species, of, fungi, have, true, circadian, rhythms, a, notable, exception, is, neurospora, crassa, a, bread, mold, widely, used, to, study, biorhythms, during, the, day, plants, engage, in, photosynthesis, and, release, oxygen, by, night, plants, engage, in, respiration, consuming, oxygen, and, releasing, carbon, dioxide, plants, can, draw, up, more, water, after, sunset, which, facilitates, new, leaf, growth, as, plants, cannot, create, energy, through, photosynthesis, after, sunset, they, use, energy, stored, in, the, plant, typically, as, starch, granules, plants, use, this, stored, energy, at, a, steady, rate, depleting, their, reserves, almost, right, at, dawn, plants, will, adjust, their, rate, of, consumption, to, match, the, expected, time, until, sunrise, this, avoids, prematurely, running, out, of, starch, reserves, and, it, allows, the, plant, to, adjust, for, longer, nights, in, the, winter, if, a, plant, is, subjected, to, artificially, early, darkness, it, will, ration, its, energy, consumption, to, last, until, dawn, succulent, plants, including, cacti, have, adapted, to, the, limited, water, availability, in, arid, environments, like, deserts, the, stomata, of, cacti, do, not, open, until, night, when, the, temperature, drops, the, pores, open, to, allow, the, cacti, to, store, carbon, dioxide, for, photosynthesis, the, next, day, a, process, known, as, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, cam, cacti, and, most, night, blooming, plants, use, cam, to, store, up, to, 99, of, the, carbon, dioxide, they, use, in, daily, photosynthesis, ceroid, cacti, often, have, flowers, that, bloom, at, night, and, fade, before, sunrise, as, few, bees, are, nocturnal, night, flowering, plants, rely, on, other, pollinators, including, moths, beetles, and, bats, these, flowers, rely, more, on, the, pollinators, sense, of, smell, with, strong, perfumes, to, attract, moths, and, foul, smelling, odors, to, attract, bats, eukaryotic, and, prokaryotic, organisms, that, engage, in, photosynthesis, are, also, affected, by, nightfall, like, plants, algae, will, switch, to, taking, in, oxygen, and, processing, energy, stored, as, starch, cyanobacteria, also, known, as, blue, algae, switch, from, photosynthesis, to, nitrogen, fixation, after, sunset, and, they, absorb, dna, at, a, much, higher, rate, before, the, industrial, era, night, was, a, time, of, heightened, insecurity, fear, of, the, night, was, common, but, varied, in, intensity, across, cultures, dangers, increased, due, to, lower, visibility, injuries, and, deaths, were, caused, by, drowning, and, falling, into, pits, ditches, and, shafts, people, were, less, able, to, evaluate, others, after, dark, due, to, nocturnal, alcohol, consumption, and, the, anonymity, of, darkness, quarrels, were, more, likely, to, escalate, to, violence, in, medieval, stockholm, the, majority, of, murders, were, committed, while, intoxicated, crime, and, fear, of, crime, increased, at, night, in, pre, industrial, europe, criminals, disguised, themselves, with, hats, face, paint, or, cloaks, thieves, would, trip, pedestrians, with, ropes, laid, across, streets, and, dismount, horse, riders, using, long, poles, extended, from, the, roadside, shadows, they, used, dark, lanterns, where, light, could, be, shined, through, a, single, side, gangs, were, uncommon, except, for, housebreaking, the, increased, humidity, of, night, was, deemed, the, result, of, vapors, and, fumes, the, annual, movements, of, stars, and, constellations, across, the, night, sky, were, used, to, track, the, passage, of, time, but, other, changes, in, the, night, sky, were, interpreted, as, significant, omens, many, daytime, religious, governmental, and, local, social, controls, dissipated, after, nightfall, fortified, christian, communities, announced, the, coming, darkness, with, horns, church, bells, or, drums, this, alerted, residents, like, peasants, working, the, fields, to, return, home, before, the, city, gates, shut, the, english, engaged, in, a, daily, process, of, shutting, in, where, valuables, were, brought, into, homes, before, they, were, bolted, barred, locked, and, shuttered, many, english, and, european, towns, attempted, to, impose, curfews, during, the, medieval, period, and, gradually, loosened, the, restrictions, via, exceptions, prayer, and, folk, magic, were, more, common, by, night, amulets, were, hung, to, ward, off, nightmares, spells, were, cast, against, thievery, and, pig, hearts, were, hung, in, chimneys, to, block, demons, from, traveling, down, them, the, common, phrase, good, night, has, been, shortened, from, god, give, you, a, good, night, in, ottoman, istanbul, the, royal, palaces, shifted, to, projecting, nocturnal, power, through, large, parties, lit, by, lanterns, candles, and, fireworks, though, alcohol, was, forbidden, for, muslims, after, dark, turkish, muslims, went, to, the, bars, and, taverns, beyond, the, muslim, areas, the, night, has, long, been, a, time, of, increased, sexual, activity, especially, in, taboo, forms, such, as, premarital, extramarital, gay, and, lesbian, sex, in, colonial, new, england, courtship, young, unmarried, couples, practiced, bundling, before, marriage, the, couples, would, lie, down, in, the, woman, s, bed, her, family, would, wrap, them, tightly, with, blankets, and, they, would, spend, the, night, together, this, way, some, families, took, precautions, to, prevent, unintended, pregnancies, like, sleeping, in, the, same, room, laying, a, large, wooden, board, between, the, couple, or, pulling, a, single, stocking, over, both, of, their, daughter, s, legs, historian, roger, ekirch, described, pre, industrial, night, as, a, sanctuary, from, ordinary, existence, artificial, lighting, expanded, the, scope, of, acceptable, work, and, leisure, after, dark, in, the, 1600s, the, major, european, cities, introduced, streetlights, these, were, lit, by, lamplighters, each, evening, outside, of, the, summer, months, early, street, lights, were, metal, and, glass, enclosures, housing, candles, or, oil, lamps, they, were, suspended, above, streets, or, mounted, on, posts, the, use, of, artificial, lighting, led, to, an, increase, in, acceptable, nightlife, in, more, rural, areas, night, remained, a, period, of, rest, and, nocturnal, labor, young, adults, the, urban, poor, prostitutes, and, thieves, benefited, from, the, anonymity, of, darkness, and, frequently, smashed, the, new, lanterns, gas, lighting, was, invented, in, the, 1800s, a, gas, mantle, was, over, ten, times, brighter, than, an, oil, lamp, gas, lighting, was, associated, with, the, creation, of, regular, police, forces, in, england, police, departments, were, tasked, with, maintaining, the, gas, lights, which, became, known, as, police, lamps, daytime, routines, were, further, pushed, back, into, the, night, by, the, electric, light, bulb, invented, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, widespread, usage, of, newer, timekeeping, devices, like, watches, electric, lights, created, night, shifts, for, traditionally, daytime, fields, like, india, s, cotton, industry, and, created, opportunities, for, working, adults, to, attend, night, school, before, the, widespread, usage, of, artificial, lighting, sleep, was, typically, split, into, two, major, segments, separated, by, about, an, hour, of, wakefulness, during, this, midnight, period, people, engaged, in, prayer, crimes, urination, sex, and, most, commonly, reflection, without, exposure, to, artificial, light, studies, show, that, people, revert, to, sleeping, in, two, separate, intervals, diverse, cultures, have, made, connections, between, the, night, sky, and, the, afterlife, many, native, american, peoples, have, described, the, milky, way, as, a, path, where, the, deceased, travel, as, stars, the, lakota, term, for, the, milky, way, is, wan, i, thach, ku, or, spirit, s, road, in, mayan, mythology, the, milky, way, s, dark, band, is, the, road, of, xibalba, the, path, to, the, underworld, unrelated, cultures, share, a, myth, of, a, star, covered, sky, goddess, who, arches, over, the, planet, after, sunset, like, citl, licue, the, aztec, personification, of, the, milky, way, the, elongated, egyptian, goddess, nut, and, n, adima, from, botswana, are, said, to, consume, the, sun, at, dusk, in, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, the, sun, then, travels, through, the, netherworld, inside, nut, s, body, where, it, is, reborn, at, dawn, many, cultures, have, personified, the, night, ratri, is, the, star, covered, hindu, goddess, of, the, night, in, the, icelandic, prose, edda, night, is, embodied, by, n, tt, ratri, and, n, tt, are, goddesses, of, sleep, and, rest, but, it, s, common, for, personifications, to, be, associated, with, misfortune, in, aztec, mythology, black, tezcatlipoca, the, night, wind, was, associated, with, obsidian, and, the, nocturnal, jaguar, in, his, precious, owl, manifestation, the, aztecs, regarded, tezcatlipoca, as, the, bringer, of, death, and, destruction, the, aztecs, anticipated, an, unending, night, when, the, tzitzim, meh, skeletal, female, star, deities, would, descend, to, consume, all, humans, in, classical, mythology, the, night, goddess, nyx, is, the, mother, of, sleep, death, disease, strife, and, doom, in, jewish, culture, and, mysticism, the, demon, lilith, embodies, the, emotional, reactions, to, darkness, including, terror, lust, and, liberation, nighttime, in, the, pre, industrial, period, often, called, the, night, season, was, associated, with, darkness, and, uncertainty, various, cultures, have, regarded, the, night, as, a, time, when, ghosts, and, other, spirits, are, active, on, earth, when, protestant, theologians, abandoned, the, concept, of, purgatory, many, came, to, view, reported, ghost, sightings, as, the, result, of, demonic, activity, in, the, sixteenth, century, swiss, theologian, ludwig, lavater, began, attempting, to, explain, reported, spirits, as, mistakes, deceit, or, the, work, of, demons, the, idea, of, night, as, a, dangerous, dark, or, haunted, time, persists, in, modern, urban, legends, like, the, vanishing, hitchhiker, many, times, in, the, night, season, there, have, been, certain, spirits, heard, softly, going, or, spitting, or, groaning, who, being, asked, what, they, were, have, made, answer, that, they, were, the, souls, of, this, or, that, man, and, that, they, now, endure, extreme, torments, in, folklore, nocturnal, preternatural, beings, like, goblins, fairies, werewolves, pucks, brownies, banshees, and, boggarts, have, overlapping, but, non, synonymous, definitions, the, werewolf, and, its, francophone, variations, the, loup, garou, and, rougarou, were, believed, to, be, people, who, transformed, into, beasts, at, night, in, west, africa, and, among, the, african, diaspora, there, is, a,
