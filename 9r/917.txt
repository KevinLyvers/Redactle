the, visible, spectrum, is, the, band, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, that, is, visible, to, the, human, eye, electromagnetic, radiation, in, this, range, of, wavelengths, is, called, visible, light, or, simply, light, the, optical, spectrum, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, the, same, as, the, visible, spectrum, but, some, authors, define, the, term, more, broadly, to, include, the, ultraviolet, and, infrared, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, as, well, known, collectively, as, optical, radiation, a, typical, human, eye, will, respond, to, wavelengths, from, about, 380, to, about, 750, nanometers, in, terms, of, frequency, this, corresponds, to, a, band, in, the, vicinity, of, 400, 790, terahertz, these, boundaries, are, not, sharply, defined, and, may, vary, per, individual, under, optimal, conditions, these, limits, of, human, perception, can, extend, to, 310, nm, ultraviolet, and, 1100, nm, near, infrared, the, spectrum, does, not, contain, all, the, colors, that, the, human, visual, system, can, distinguish, unsaturated, colors, such, as, pink, or, purple, variations, like, magenta, for, example, are, absent, because, they, can, only, be, made, from, a, mix, of, multiple, wavelengths, colors, containing, only, one, wavelength, are, also, called, pure, colors, or, spectral, colors, visible, wavelengths, pass, largely, unattenuated, through, the, earth, s, atmosphere, via, the, optical, window, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, an, example, of, this, phenomenon, is, when, clean, air, scatters, blue, light, more, than, red, light, and, so, the, midday, sky, appears, blue, apart, from, the, area, around, the, sun, which, appears, white, because, the, light, is, not, scattered, as, much, the, optical, window, is, also, referred, to, as, the, visible, window, because, it, overlaps, the, human, visible, response, spectrum, the, near, infrared, nir, window, lies, just, out, of, the, human, vision, as, well, as, the, medium, wavelength, infrared, mwir, window, and, the, long, wavelength, or, far, infrared, lwir, or, fir, window, although, other, animals, may, perceive, them, colors, that, can, be, produced, by, visible, light, of, a, narrow, band, of, wavelengths, monochromatic, light, are, called, pure, spectral, colors, the, various, color, ranges, indicated, in, the, illustration, are, an, approximation, the, spectrum, is, continuous, with, no, clear, boundaries, between, one, color, and, the, next, in, the, 13th, century, roger, bacon, theorized, that, rainbows, were, produced, by, a, similar, process, to, the, passage, of, light, through, glass, or, crystal, in, the, 17th, century, isaac, newton, discovered, that, prisms, could, disassemble, and, reassemble, white, light, and, described, the, phenomenon, in, his, book, opticks, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, spectrum, latin, for, appearance, or, apparition, in, this, sense, in, print, in, 1671, in, describing, his, experiments, in, optics, newton, observed, that, when, a, narrow, beam, of, sunlight, strikes, the, face, of, a, glass, prism, at, an, angle, some, is, reflected, and, some, of, the, beam, passes, into, and, through, the, glass, emerging, as, different, colored, bands, newton, hypothesized, light, to, be, made, up, of, corpuscles, particles, of, different, colors, with, the, different, colors, of, light, moving, at, different, speeds, in, transparent, matter, red, light, moving, more, quickly, than, violet, in, glass, the, result, is, that, red, light, is, bent, refracted, less, sharply, than, violet, as, it, passes, through, the, prism, creating, a, spectrum, of, colors, newton, originally, divided, the, spectrum, into, six, named, colors, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and, violet, he, later, added, indigo, as, the, seventh, color, since, he, believed, that, seven, was, a, perfect, number, as, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, sophists, of, there, being, a, connection, between, the, colors, the, musical, notes, the, known, objects, in, the, solar, system, and, the, days, of, the, week, the, human, eye, is, relatively, insensitive, to, indigo, s, frequencies, and, some, people, who, have, otherwise, good, vision, cannot, distinguish, indigo, from, blue, and, violet, for, this, reason, some, later, commentators, including, isaac, asimov, have, suggested, that, indigo, should, not, be, regarded, as, a, color, in, its, own, right, but, merely, as, a, shade, of, blue, or, violet, evidence, indicates, that, what, newton, meant, by, indigo, and, blue, does, not, correspond, to, the, modern, meanings, of, those, color, words, comparing, newton, s, observation, of, prismatic, colors, with, a, color, image, of, the, visible, light, spectrum, shows, that, indigo, corresponds, to, what, is, today, called, blue, whereas, his, blue, corresponds, to, cyan, in, the, 18th, century, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, wrote, about, optical, spectra, in, his, theory, of, colours, goethe, used, the, word, spectrum, spektrum, to, designate, a, ghostly, optical, afterimage, as, did, schopenhauer, in, on, vision, and, colors, goethe, argued, that, the, continuous, spectrum, was, a, compound, phenomenon, where, newton, narrowed, the, beam, of, light, to, isolate, the, phenomenon, goethe, observed, that, a, wider, aperture, produces, not, a, spectrum, but, rather, reddish, yellow, and, blue, cyan, edges, with, white, between, them, the, spectrum, appears, only, when, these, edges, are, close, enough, to, overlap, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, concept, of, the, visible, spectrum, became, more, definite, as, light, outside, the, visible, range, was, discovered, and, characterized, by, william, herschel, infrared, and, johann, wilhelm, ritter, ultraviolet, thomas, young, thomas, johann, seebeck, and, others, young, was, the, first, to, measure, the, wavelengths, of, different, colors, of, light, in, 1802, the, connection, between, the, visible, spectrum, and, color, vision, was, explored, by, thomas, young, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, in, the, early, 19th, century, their, theory, of, color, vision, correctly, proposed, that, the, eye, uses, three, distinct, receptors, to, perceive, color, the, visible, spectrum, is, limited, to, wavelengths, that, can, both, reach, the, retina, and, trigger, visual, phototransduction, excite, a, visual, opsin, insensitivity, to, uv, light, is, generally, limited, by, transmission, through, the, lens, insensitivity, to, ir, light, is, limited, by, the, spectral, sensitivity, functions, of, the, visual, opsins, the, range, is, defined, psychometrically, by, the, luminous, efficiency, function, which, accounts, for, all, of, these, factors, in, humans, there, is, a, separate, function, for, each, of, two, visual, systems, one, for, photopic, vision, used, in, daylight, which, is, mediated, by, cone, cells, and, one, for, scotopic, vision, used, in, dim, light, which, is, mediated, by, rod, cells, each, of, these, functions, have, different, visible, ranges, however, discussion, on, the, visible, range, generally, assumes, photopic, vision, the, visible, range, of, most, animals, evolved, to, match, the, optical, window, which, is, the, range, of, light, that, can, pass, through, the, atmosphere, the, ozone, layer, absorbs, almost, all, uv, light, below, 315, nm, however, this, only, affects, cosmic, light, e, g, sunlight, not, terrestrial, light, e, g, bioluminescence, before, reaching, the, retina, light, must, first, transmit, through, the, cornea, and, lens, uvb, light, 315, nm, is, filtered, mostly, by, the, cornea, and, uva, light, 315, 400, nm, is, filtered, mostly, by, the, lens, the, lens, also, yellows, with, age, attenuating, transmission, most, strongly, at, the, blue, part, of, the, spectrum, this, can, cause, xanthopsia, as, well, as, a, slight, truncation, of, the, short, wave, blue, limit, of, the, visible, spectrum, subjects, with, aphakia, are, missing, a, lens, so, uva, light, can, reach, the, retina, and, excite, the, visual, opsins, this, expands, the, visible, range, and, may, also, lead, to, cyanopsia, each, opsin, has, a, spectral, sensitivity, function, which, defines, how, likely, it, is, to, absorb, a, photon, of, each, wavelength, the, luminous, efficiency, function, is, approximately, the, superposition, of, the, contributing, visual, opsins, variance, in, the, position, of, the, individual, opsin, spectral, sensitivity, functions, therefore, affects, the, luminous, efficiency, function, and, the, visible, range, for, example, the, long, wave, red, limit, changes, proportionally, to, the, position, of, the, l, opsin, the, positions, are, defined, by, the, peak, wavelength, wavelength, of, highest, sensitivity, so, as, the, l, opsin, peak, wavelength, blue, shifts, by, 10, nm, the, long, wave, limit, of, the, visible, spectrum, also, shifts, 10, nm, large, deviations, of, the, l, opsin, peak, wavelength, lead, to, a, form, of, color, blindness, called, protanomaly, and, a, missing, l, opsin, protanopia, shortens, the, visible, spectrum, by, about, 30, nm, at, the, long, wave, limit, forms, of, color, blindness, affecting, the, m, opsin, and, s, opsin, do, not, significantly, affect, the, luminous, efficiency, function, nor, the, limits, of, the, visible, spectrum, regardless, of, actual, physical, and, biological, variance, the, definition, of, the, limits, is, not, standard, and, will, change, depending, on, the, industry, for, example, some, industries, may, be, concerned, with, practical, limits, so, would, conservatively, report, 420, 680, nm, while, others, may, be, concerned, with, psychometrics, and, achieving, the, broadest, spectrum, would, liberally, report, 380, 750, or, even, 380, 800, nm, the, luminous, efficiency, function, in, the, nir, does, not, have, a, hard, cutoff, but, rather, an, exponential, decay, such, that, the, function, s, value, or, vision, sensitivity, at, 1, 050, nm, is, about, 10, 9, times, weaker, than, at, 700, nm, much, higher, intensity, is, therefore, required, to, perceive, 1, 050, nm, light, than, 700, nm, light, under, ideal, laboratory, conditions, subjects, may, perceive, infrared, light, up, to, at, least, 1, 064, nm, while, 1, 050, nm, nir, light, can, evoke, red, suggesting, direct, absorption, by, the, l, opsin, there, are, also, reports, that, pulsed, nir, lasers, can, evoke, green, which, suggests, two, photon, absorption, may, be, enabling, extended, nir, sensitivity, similarly, young, subjects, may, perceive, ultraviolet, wavelengths, down, to, about, 310, 313, nm, but, detection, of, light, below, 380, nm, may, be, due, to, fluorescence, of, the, ocular, media, rather, than, direct, absorption, of, uv, light, by, the, opsins, as, uva, light, is, absorbed, by, the, ocular, media, lens, and, cornea, it, may, fluoresce, and, be, released, at, a, lower, energy, longer, wavelength, that, can, then, be, absorbed, by, the, opsins, for, example, when, the, lens, absorbs, 350, nm, light, the, fluorescence, emission, spectrum, is, centered, on, 440, nm, in, addition, to, the, photopic, and, scotopic, systems, humans, have, other, systems, for, detecting, light, that, do, not, contribute, to, the, primary, visual, system, for, example, melanopsin, has, an, absorption, range, of, 420, 540, nm, and, regulates, circadian, rhythm, and, other, reflexive, processes, since, the, melanopsin, system, does, not, form, images, it, is, not, strictly, considered, vision, and, does, not, contribute, to, the, visible, range, the, visible, spectrum, is, defined, as, that, visible, to, humans, but, the, variance, between, species, is, large, not, only, can, cone, opsins, be, spectrally, shifted, to, alter, the, visible, range, but, vertebrates, with, 4, cones, tetrachromatic, or, 2, cones, dichromatic, relative, to, humans, 3, trichromatic, will, also, tend, to, have, a, wider, or, narrower, visible, spectrum, than, humans, respectively, vertebrates, tend, to, have, 1, 4, different, opsin, classes, testing, the, visual, systems, of, animals, behaviorally, is, difficult, so, the, visible, range, of, animals, is, usually, estimated, by, comparing, the, peak, wavelengths, of, opsins, with, those, of, typical, humans, s, opsin, at, 420, nm, and, l, opsin, at, 560, nm, most, mammals, have, retained, only, two, opsin, classes, lws, and, vs, due, likely, to, the, nocturnal, bottleneck, however, old, world, primates, including, humans, have, since, evolved, two, versions, in, the, lws, class, to, regain, trichromacy, unlike, most, mammals, rodents, uvs, opsins, have, remained, at, shorter, wavelengths, along, with, their, lack, of, uv, filters, in, the, lens, mice, have, a, uvs, opsin, that, can, detect, down, to, 340, nm, while, allowing, uv, light, to, reach, the, retina, can, lead, to, retinal, damage, the, short, lifespan, of, mice, compared, with, other, mammals, may, minimize, this, disadvantage, relative, to, the, advantage, of, uv, vision, dogs, have, two, cone, opsins, at, 429, nm, and, 555, nm, so, see, almost, the, entire, visible, spectrum, of, humans, despite, being, dichromatic, horses, have, two, cone, opsins, at, 428, nm, and, 539, nm, yielding, a, slightly, more, truncated, red, vision, most, other, vertebrates, birds, lizards, fish, etc, have, retained, their, tetrachromacy, including, uvs, opsins, that, extend, further, into, the, ultraviolet, than, humans, vs, opsin, the, sensitivity, of, avian, uvs, opsins, vary, greatly, from, 355, 425, nm, and, lws, opsins, from, 560, 570, nm, this, translates, to, some, birds, with, a, visible, spectrum, on, par, with, humans, and, other, birds, with, greatly, expanded, sensitivity, to, uv, light, the, lws, opsin, of, birds, is, sometimes, reported, to, have, a, peak, wavelength, above, 600, nm, but, this, is, an, effective, peak, wavelength, that, incorporates, the, filter, of, avian, oil, droplets, the, peak, wavelength, of, the, lws, opsin, alone, is, the, better, predictor, of, the, long, wave, limit, a, possible, benefit, of, avian, uv, vision, involves, sex, dependent, markings, on, their, plumage, that, are, visible, only, in, the, ultraviolet, range, teleosts, bony, fish, are, generally, tetrachromatic, the, sensitivity, of, fish, uvs, opsins, vary, from, 347, 383, nm, and, lws, opsins, from, 500, 570, nm, however, some, fish, that, use, alternative, chromophores, can, extend, their, lws, opsin, sensitivity, to, 625, nm, the, popular, belief, that, the, common, goldfish, is, the, only, animal, that, can, see, both, infrared, and, ultraviolet, light, is, incorrect, because, goldfish, cannot, see, infrared, light, the, visual, systems, of, invertebrates, deviate, greatly, from, vertebrates, so, direct, comparisons, are, difficult, however, uv, sensitivity, has, been, reported, in, most, insect, species, bees, and, many, other, insects, can, detect, ultraviolet, light, which, helps, them, find, nectar, in, flowers, plant, species, that, depend, on, insect, pollination, may, owe, reproductive, success, to, their, appearance, in, ultraviolet, light, rather, than, how, colorful, they, appear, to, humans, bees, long, wave, limit, is, at, about, 590, nm, mantis, shrimp, exhibit, up, to, 14, opsins, enabling, a, visible, range, of, less, than, 300, nm, to, above, 700, nm, some, snakes, can, see, radiant, heat, at, wavelengths, between, 5, and, 30, m, to, a, degree, of, accuracy, such, that, a, blind, rattlesnake, can, target, vulnerable, body, parts, of, the, prey, at, which, it, strikes, and, other, snakes, with, the, organ, may, detect, warm, bodies, from, a, meter, away, it, may, also, be, used, in, thermoregulation, and, predator, detection, spectroscopy, is, the, study, of, objects, based, on, the, spectrum, of, color, they, emit, absorb, or, reflect, visible, light, spectroscopy, is, an, important, tool, in, astronomy, as, is, spectroscopy, at, other, wavelengths, where, scientists, use, it, to, analyze, the, properties, of, distant, objects, chemical, elements, and, small, molecules, can, be, detected, in, astronomical, objects, by, observing, emission, lines, and, absorption, lines, for, example, helium, was, first, detected, by, analysis, of, the, spectrum, of, the, sun, the, shift, in, frequency, of, spectral, lines, is, used, to, measure, the, doppler, shift, redshift, or, blueshift, of, distant, objects, to, determine, their, velocities, towards, or, away, from, the, observer, astronomical, spectroscopy, uses, high, dispersion, diffraction, gratings, to, observe, spectra, at, very, high, spectral, resolutions
