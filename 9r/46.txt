https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)
the, pascal, symbol, pa, is, the, unit, of, pressure, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, also, used, to, quantify, internal, pressure, stress, young, s, modulus, and, ultimate, tensile, strength, the, unit, named, after, blaise, pascal, is, an, si, coherent, derived, unit, defined, as, one, newton, per, square, metre, n, m, 2, it, is, also, equivalent, to, 10, barye, 10, ba, in, the, cgs, system, common, multiple, units, of, the, pascal, are, the, hectopascal, 1, hpa, 100, pa, which, is, equal, to, one, millibar, and, the, kilopascal, 1, kpa, 1000, pa, which, is, equal, to, one, centibar, the, unit, of, measurement, called, standard, atmosphere, atm, is, defined, as, 101, 325, pa, meteorological, observations, typically, report, atmospheric, pressure, in, hectopascals, per, the, recommendation, of, the, world, meteorological, organization, thus, a, standard, atmosphere, atm, or, typical, sea, level, air, pressure, is, about, 1013, hpa, reports, in, the, united, states, typically, use, inches, of, mercury, or, millibars, hectopascals, in, canada, these, reports, are, given, in, kilopascals, the, unit, is, named, after, blaise, pascal, noted, for, his, contributions, to, hydrodynamics, and, hydrostatics, and, experiments, with, a, barometer, the, name, pascal, was, adopted, for, the, si, unit, newton, per, square, metre, n, m, 2, by, the, 14th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1971, the, pascal, can, be, expressed, using, si, derived, units, or, alternatively, solely, si, base, units, as, where, n, is, the, newton, m, is, the, metre, kg, is, the, kilogram, s, is, the, second, and, j, is, the, joule, one, pascal, is, the, pressure, exerted, by, a, force, of, magnitude, one, newton, perpendicularly, upon, an, area, of, one, square, metre, the, unit, of, measurement, called, an, atmosphere, or, a, standard, atmosphere, atm, is, 101, 325, pa, 101, 325, kpa, this, value, is, often, used, as, a, reference, pressure, and, specified, as, such, in, some, national, and, international, standards, such, as, the, international, organization, for, standardization, s, iso, 2787, pneumatic, tools, and, compressors, iso, 2533, aerospace, and, iso, 5024, petroleum, in, contrast, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, recommends, the, use, of, 100, kpa, as, a, standard, pressure, when, reporting, the, properties, of, substances, unicode, has, dedicated, code, points, u, 33a9, square, pa, and, u, 33aa, square, kpa, in, the, cjk, compatibility, block, but, these, exist, only, for, backward, compatibility, with, some, older, ideographic, character, sets, and, are, therefore, deprecated, the, pascal, pa, or, kilopascal, kpa, as, a, unit, of, pressure, measurement, is, widely, used, throughout, the, world, and, has, largely, replaced, the, pounds, per, square, inch, psi, unit, except, in, some, countries, that, still, use, the, imperial, measurement, system, or, the, us, customary, system, including, the, united, states, geophysicists, use, the, gigapascal, gpa, in, measuring, or, calculating, tectonic, stresses, and, pressures, within, the, earth, medical, elastography, measures, tissue, stiffness, non, invasively, with, ultrasound, or, magnetic, resonance, imaging, and, often, displays, the, young, s, modulus, or, shear, modulus, of, tissue, in, kilopascals, in, materials, science, and, engineering, the, pascal, measures, the, stiffness, tensile, strength, and, compressive, strength, of, materials, in, engineering, the, megapascal, mpa, is, the, preferred, unit, for, these, uses, because, the, pascal, represents, a, very, small, quantity, the, pascal, is, also, equivalent, to, the, si, unit, of, energy, density, the, joule, per, cubic, metre, this, applies, not, only, to, the, thermodynamics, of, pressurised, gases, but, also, to, the, energy, density, of, electric, magnetic, and, gravitational, fields, the, pascal, is, used, to, measure, sound, pressure, loudness, is, the, subjective, experience, of, sound, pressure, and, is, measured, as, a, sound, pressure, level, spl, on, a, logarithmic, scale, of, the, sound, pressure, relative, to, some, reference, pressure, for, sound, in, air, a, pressure, of, 20, pa, is, considered, to, be, at, the, threshold, of, hearing, for, humans, and, is, a, common, reference, pressure, so, that, its, spl, is, zero, the, airtightness, of, buildings, is, measured, at, 50, pa, in, medicine, blood, pressure, is, measured, in, millimeters, of, mercury, mmhg, very, close, to, one, torr, the, normal, adult, blood, pressure, is, less, than, 120, mmhg, systolic, bp, sbp, and, less, than, 80, mmhg, diastolic, bp, dbp, convert, mmhg, to, si, units, as, follows, 1, mmhg, 0, 13332, kpa, hence, normal, blood, pressure, in, si, units, is, less, than, 16, 0, kpa, sbp, and, less, than, 10, 7, kpa, dbp, these, values, are, similar, to, the, pressure, of, water, column, of, average, human, height, so, pressure, has, to, be, measured, on, arm, roughly, at, the, level, of, the, heart, the, units, of, atmospheric, pressure, commonly, used, in, meteorology, were, formerly, the, bar, 100, 000, pa, which, is, close, to, the, average, air, pressure, on, earth, and, the, millibar, since, the, introduction, of, si, units, meteorologists, generally, measure, pressures, in, hectopascals, hpa, unit, equal, to, 100, pascals, or, 1, millibar, exceptions, include, canada, which, uses, kilopascals, kpa, in, many, other, fields, of, science, prefixes, that, are, a, power, of, 1000, are, preferred, which, excludes, the, hectopascal, from, use, many, countries, also, use, millibars, in, practically, all, other, fields, the, kilopascal, is, used, instead, decimal, multiples, and, submultiples, are, formed, using, standard, si, units
