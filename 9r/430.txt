astatine, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, at, and, atomic, number, 85, it, is, the, rarest, naturally, occurring, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, occurring, only, as, the, decay, product, of, various, heavier, elements, all, of, astatine, s, isotopes, are, short, lived, the, most, stable, is, astatine, 210, with, a, half, life, of, 8, 1, hours, consequently, a, solid, sample, of, the, element, has, never, been, seen, because, any, macroscopic, specimen, would, be, immediately, vaporized, by, the, heat, of, its, radioactivity, the, bulk, properties, of, astatine, are, not, known, with, certainty, many, of, them, have, been, estimated, from, its, position, on, the, periodic, table, as, a, heavier, analog, of, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, the, four, stable, halogens, however, astatine, also, falls, roughly, along, the, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, and, some, metallic, behavior, has, also, been, observed, and, predicted, for, it, astatine, is, likely, to, have, a, dark, or, lustrous, appearance, and, may, be, a, semiconductor, or, possibly, a, metal, chemically, several, anionic, species, of, astatine, are, known, and, most, of, its, compounds, resemble, those, of, iodine, but, it, also, sometimes, displays, metallic, characteristics, and, shows, some, similarities, to, silver, the, first, synthesis, of, astatine, was, in, 1940, by, dale, r, corson, kenneth, ross, mackenzie, and, emilio, g, segr, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, they, named, it, from, the, ancient, greek, astatos, unstable, four, isotopes, of, astatine, were, subsequently, found, to, be, naturally, occurring, although, much, less, than, one, gram, is, present, at, any, given, time, in, the, earth, s, crust, neither, the, most, stable, isotope, astatine, 210, nor, the, medically, useful, astatine, 211, occur, naturally, they, are, usually, produced, by, bombarding, bismuth, 209, with, alpha, particles, astatine, is, an, extremely, radioactive, element, all, its, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, 8, 1, hours, or, less, decaying, into, other, astatine, isotopes, bismuth, polonium, or, radon, most, of, its, isotopes, are, very, unstable, with, half, lives, of, seconds, or, less, of, the, first, 101, elements, in, the, periodic, table, only, francium, is, less, stable, and, all, the, astatine, isotopes, more, stable, than, the, longest, lived, francium, isotopes, 205, 211, at, are, in, any, case, synthetic, and, do, not, occur, in, nature, the, bulk, properties, of, astatine, are, not, known, with, any, certainty, research, is, limited, by, its, short, half, life, which, prevents, the, creation, of, weighable, quantities, a, visible, piece, of, astatine, would, immediately, vaporize, itself, because, of, the, heat, generated, by, its, intense, radioactivity, it, remains, to, be, seen, if, with, sufficient, cooling, a, macroscopic, quantity, of, astatine, could, be, deposited, as, a, thin, film, astatine, is, usually, classified, as, either, a, nonmetal, or, a, metalloid, metal, formation, has, also, been, predicted, most, of, the, physical, properties, of, astatine, have, been, estimated, by, interpolation, or, extrapolation, using, theoretically, or, empirically, derived, methods, for, example, halogens, get, darker, with, increasing, atomic, weight, fluorine, is, nearly, colorless, chlorine, is, yellow, green, bromine, is, red, brown, and, iodine, is, dark, gray, violet, astatine, is, sometimes, described, as, probably, being, a, black, solid, assuming, it, follows, this, trend, or, as, having, a, metallic, appearance, if, it, is, a, metalloid, or, a, metal, astatine, sublimes, less, readily, than, iodine, having, a, lower, vapor, pressure, even, so, half, of, a, given, quantity, of, astatine, will, vaporize, in, approximately, an, hour, if, put, on, a, clean, glass, surface, at, room, temperature, the, absorption, spectrum, of, astatine, in, the, middle, ultraviolet, region, has, lines, at, 224, 401, and, 216, 225, nm, suggestive, of, 6p, to, 7s, transitions, the, structure, of, solid, astatine, is, unknown, as, an, analog, of, iodine, it, may, have, an, orthorhombic, crystalline, structure, composed, of, diatomic, astatine, molecules, and, be, a, semiconductor, with, a, band, gap, of, 0, 7, ev, alternatively, if, condensed, astatine, forms, a, metallic, phase, as, has, been, predicted, it, may, have, a, monatomic, face, centered, cubic, structure, in, this, structure, it, may, well, be, a, superconductor, like, the, similar, high, pressure, phase, of, iodine, metallic, astatine, is, expected, to, have, a, density, of, 8, 91, 8, 95, g, cm, 3, evidence, for, or, against, the, existence, of, diatomic, astatine, at, 2, is, sparse, and, inconclusive, some, sources, state, that, it, does, not, exist, or, at, least, has, never, been, observed, while, other, sources, assert, or, imply, its, existence, despite, this, controversy, many, properties, of, diatomic, astatine, have, been, predicted, for, example, its, bond, length, would, be, 300, 10, pm, dissociation, energy, 50, kj, mol, and, heat, of, vaporization, h, vap, 54, 39, kj, mol, many, values, have, been, predicted, for, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, astatine, but, only, for, at, 2, the, chemistry, of, astatine, is, clouded, by, the, extremely, low, concentrations, at, which, astatine, experiments, have, been, conducted, and, the, possibility, of, reactions, with, impurities, walls, and, filters, or, radioactivity, by, products, and, other, unwanted, nano, scale, interactions, many, of, its, apparent, chemical, properties, have, been, observed, using, tracer, studies, on, extremely, dilute, astatine, solutions, typically, less, than, 10, 10, mol, l, 1, some, properties, such, as, anion, formation, align, with, other, halogens, astatine, has, some, metallic, characteristics, as, well, such, as, plating, onto, a, cathode, and, coprecipitating, with, metal, sulfides, in, hydrochloric, acid, it, forms, complexes, with, edta, a, metal, chelating, agent, and, is, capable, of, acting, as, a, metal, in, antibody, radiolabeling, in, some, respects, astatine, in, the, 1, state, is, akin, to, silver, in, the, same, state, most, of, the, organic, chemistry, of, astatine, is, however, analogous, to, that, of, iodine, it, has, been, suggested, that, astatine, can, form, a, stable, monatomic, cation, in, aqueous, solution, astatine, has, an, electronegativity, of, 2, 2, on, the, revised, pauling, scale, lower, than, that, of, iodine, 2, 66, and, the, same, as, hydrogen, in, hydrogen, astatide, hat, the, negative, charge, is, predicted, to, be, on, the, hydrogen, atom, implying, that, this, compound, could, be, referred, to, as, astatine, hydride, according, to, certain, nomenclatures, that, would, be, consistent, with, the, electronegativity, of, astatine, on, the, allred, rochow, scale, 1, 9, being, less, than, that, of, hydrogen, 2, 2, however, official, iupac, stoichiometric, nomenclature, is, based, on, an, idealized, convention, of, determining, the, relative, electronegativities, of, the, elements, by, the, mere, virtue, of, their, position, within, the, periodic, table, according, to, this, convention, astatine, is, handled, as, though, it, is, more, electronegative, than, hydrogen, irrespective, of, its, true, electronegativity, the, electron, affinity, of, astatine, at, 233, kj, mol, 1, is, 21, less, than, that, of, iodine, in, comparison, the, value, of, cl, 349, is, 6, 4, higher, than, f, 328, br, 325, is, 6, 9, less, than, cl, and, i, 295, is, 9, 2, less, than, br, the, marked, reduction, for, at, was, predicted, as, being, due, to, spin, orbit, interactions, the, first, ionization, energy, of, astatine, is, about, 899, kj, mol, 1, which, continues, the, trend, of, decreasing, first, ionization, energies, down, the, halogen, group, fluorine, 1681, chlorine, 1251, bromine, 1140, iodine, 1008, less, reactive, than, iodine, astatine, is, the, least, reactive, of, the, halogens, the, chemical, properties, of, tennessine, the, next, heavier, group, 17, element, have, not, yet, been, investigated, however, astatine, compounds, have, been, synthesized, in, nano, scale, amounts, and, studied, as, intensively, as, possible, before, their, radioactive, disintegration, the, reactions, involved, have, been, typically, tested, with, dilute, solutions, of, astatine, mixed, with, larger, amounts, of, iodine, acting, as, a, carrier, the, iodine, ensures, there, is, sufficient, material, for, laboratory, techniques, such, as, filtration, and, precipitation, to, work, like, iodine, astatine, has, been, shown, to, adopt, odd, numbered, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 1, to, 7, only, a, few, compounds, with, metals, have, been, reported, in, the, form, of, astatides, of, sodium, palladium, silver, thallium, and, lead, some, characteristic, properties, of, silver, and, sodium, astatide, and, the, other, hypothetical, alkali, and, alkaline, earth, astatides, have, been, estimated, by, extrapolation, from, other, metal, halides, the, formation, of, an, astatine, compound, with, hydrogen, usually, referred, to, as, hydrogen, astatide, was, noted, by, the, pioneers, of, astatine, chemistry, as, mentioned, there, are, grounds, for, instead, referring, to, this, compound, as, astatine, hydride, it, is, easily, oxidized, acidification, by, dilute, nitric, acid, gives, the, at, 0, or, at, forms, and, the, subsequent, addition, of, silver, i, may, only, partially, at, best, precipitate, astatine, as, silver, i, astatide, agat, iodine, in, contrast, is, not, oxidized, and, precipitates, readily, as, silver, i, iodide, astatine, is, known, to, bind, to, boron, carbon, and, nitrogen, various, boron, cage, compounds, have, been, prepared, with, at, b, bonds, these, being, more, stable, than, at, c, bonds, astatine, can, replace, a, hydrogen, atom, in, benzene, to, form, astatobenzene, c, 6, h, 5, at, this, may, be, oxidized, to, c, 6, h, 5, atcl, 2, by, chlorine, by, treating, this, compound, with, an, alkaline, solution, of, hypochlorite, c, 6, h, 5, ato, 2, can, be, produced, the, dipyridine, astatine, i, cation, forms, ionic, compounds, with, perchlorate, a, non, coordinating, anion, and, with, nitrate, no, 3, this, cation, exists, as, a, coordination, complex, in, which, two, dative, covalent, bonds, separately, link, the, astatine, i, centre, with, each, of, the, pyridine, rings, via, their, nitrogen, atoms, with, oxygen, there, is, evidence, of, the, species, ato, and, ato, in, aqueous, solution, formed, by, the, reaction, of, astatine, with, an, oxidant, such, as, elemental, bromine, or, in, the, last, case, by, sodium, persulfate, in, a, solution, of, perchloric, acid, the, species, previously, thought, to, be, ato, 2, has, since, been, determined, to, be, ato, oh, 2, a, hydrolysis, product, of, ato, another, such, hydrolysis, product, being, atooh, the, well, characterized, ato, 3, anion, can, be, obtained, by, for, example, the, oxidation, of, astatine, with, potassium, hypochlorite, in, a, solution, of, potassium, hydroxide, preparation, of, lanthanum, triastatate, la, ato, 3, 3, following, the, oxidation, of, astatine, by, a, hot, na, 2, s, 2, o, 8, solution, has, been, reported, further, oxidation, of, ato, 3, such, as, by, xenon, difluoride, in, a, hot, alkaline, solution, or, periodate, in, a, neutral, or, alkaline, solution, yields, the, perastatate, ion, ato, 4, this, is, only, stable, in, neutral, or, alkaline, solutions, astatine, is, also, thought, to, be, capable, of, forming, cations, in, salts, with, oxyanions, such, as, iodate, or, dichromate, this, is, based, on, the, observation, that, in, acidic, solutions, monovalent, or, intermediate, positive, states, of, astatine, coprecipitate, with, the, insoluble, salts, of, metal, cations, such, as, silver, i, iodate, or, thallium, i, dichromate, astatine, may, form, bonds, to, the, other, chalcogens, these, include, s, 7, at, and, at, csn, 2, with, sulfur, a, coordination, selenourea, compound, with, selenium, and, an, astatine, tellurium, colloid, with, tellurium, astatine, is, known, to, react, with, its, lighter, homologs, iodine, bromine, and, chlorine, in, the, vapor, state, these, reactions, produce, diatomic, interhalogen, compounds, with, formulas, ati, atbr, and, atcl, the, first, two, compounds, may, also, be, produced, in, water, astatine, reacts, with, iodine, iodide, solution, to, form, ati, whereas, atbr, requires, aside, from, astatine, an, iodine, iodine, monobromide, bromide, solution, the, excess, of, iodides, or, bromides, may, lead, to, atbr, 2, and, ati, 2, ions, or, in, a, chloride, solution, they, may, produce, species, like, atcl, 2, or, atbrcl, via, equilibrium, reactions, with, the, chlorides, oxidation, of, the, element, with, dichromate, in, nitric, acid, solution, showed, that, adding, chloride, turned, the, astatine, into, a, molecule, likely, to, be, either, atcl, or, atocl, similarly, atocl, 2, or, atcl, 2, may, be, produced, the, polyhalides, pdati, 2, csati, 2, tlati, 2, and, pbati, are, known, or, presumed, to, have, been, precipitated, in, a, plasma, ion, source, mass, spectrometer, the, ions, and, have, been, formed, by, introducing, lighter, halogen, vapors, into, a, helium, filled, cell, containing, astatine, supporting, the, existence, of, stable, neutral, molecules, in, the, plasma, ion, state, no, astatine, fluorides, have, been, discovered, yet, their, absence, has, been, speculatively, attributed, to, the, extreme, reactivity, of, such, compounds, including, the, reaction, of, an, initially, formed, fluoride, with, the, walls, of, the, glass, container, to, form, a, non, volatile, product, thus, although, the, synthesis, of, an, astatine, fluoride, is, thought, to, be, possible, it, may, require, a, liquid, halogen, fluoride, solvent, as, has, already, been, used, for, the, characterization, of, radon, fluoride, in, 1869, when, dmitri, mendeleev, published, his, periodic, table, the, space, under, iodine, was, empty, after, niels, bohr, established, the, physical, basis, of, the, classification, of, chemical, elements, it, was, suggested, that, the, fifth, halogen, belonged, there, before, its, officially, recognized, discovery, it, was, called, eka, iodine, from, sanskrit, eka, one, to, imply, it, was, one, space, under, iodine, in, the, same, manner, as, eka, silicon, eka, boron, and, others, scientists, tried, to, find, it, in, nature, given, its, extreme, rarity, these, attempts, resulted, in, several, false, discoveries, the, first, claimed, discovery, of, eka, iodine, was, made, by, fred, allison, and, his, associates, at, the, alabama, polytechnic, institute, now, auburn, university, in, 1931, the, discoverers, named, element, 85, alabamine, and, assigned, it, the, symbol, ab, designations, that, were, used, for, a, few, years, in, 1934, h, g, macpherson, of, university, of, california, berkeley, disproved, allison, s, method, and, the, validity, of, his, discovery, there, was, another, claim, in, 1937, by, the, chemist, rajendralal, de, working, in, dacca, in, british, india, now, dhaka, in, bangladesh, he, chose, the, name, dakin, for, element, 85, which, he, claimed, to, have, isolated, as, the, thorium, series, equivalent, of, radium, f, polonium, 210, in, the, radium, series, the, properties, he, reported, for, dakin, do, not, correspond, to, those, of, astatine, and, astatine, s, radioactivity, would, have, prevented, him, from, handling, it, in, the, quantities, he, claimed, moreover, astatine, is, not, found, in, the, thorium, series, and, the, true, identity, of, dakin, is, not, known, in, 1936, the, team, of, romanian, physicist, horia, hulubei, and, french, physicist, yvette, cauchois, claimed, to, have, discovered, element, 85, by, observing, its, x, ray, emission, lines, in, 1939, they, published, another, paper, which, supported, and, extended, previous, data, in, 1944, hulubei, published, a, summary, of, data, he, had, obtained, up, to, that, time, claiming, it, was, supported, by, the, work, of, other, researchers, he, chose, the, name, dor, presumably, from, the, romanian, for, longing, as, world, war, ii, had, started, five, years, earlier, as, hulubei, was, writing, in, french, a, language, which, does, not, accommodate, the, ine, suffix, dor, would, likely, have, been, rendered, in, english, as, dorine, had, it, been, adopted, in, 1947, hulubei, s, claim, was, effectively, rejected, by, the, austrian, chemist, friedrich, paneth, who, would, later, chair, the, iupac, committee, responsible, for, recognition, of, new, elements, even, though, hulubei, s, samples, did, contain, astatine, 218, his, means, to, detect, it, were, too, weak, by, current, standards, to, enable, correct, identification, moreover, he, could, not, perform, chemical, tests, on, the, element, he, had, also, been, involved, in, an, earlier, false, claim, as, to, the, discovery, of, element, 87, francium, and, this, is, thought, to, have, caused, other, researchers, to, downplay, his, work, in, 1940, the, swiss, chemist, walter, minder, announced, the, discovery, of, element, 85, as, the, beta, decay, product, of, radium, a, polonium, 218, choosing, the, name, helvetium, from, helvetia, the, latin, name, of, switzerland, berta, karlik, and, traude, bernert, were, unsuccessful, in, reproducing, his, experiments, and, subsequently, attributed, minder, s, results, to, contamination, of, his, radon, stream, radon, 222, is, the, parent, isotope, of, polonium, 218, in, 1942, minder, in, collaboration, with, the, english, scientist, alice, leigh, smith, announced, the, discovery, of, another, isotope, of, element, 85, presumed, to, be, the, product, of, thorium, a, polonium, 216, beta, decay, they, named, this, substance, anglo, helvetium, but, karlik, and, bernert, were, again, unable, to, reproduce, these, results, later, in, 1940, dale, r, corson, kenneth, ross, mackenzie, and, emilio, segr, isolated, the, element, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, instead, of, searching, for, the, element, in, nature, the, scientists, created, it, by, bombarding, bismuth, 209, with, alpha, particles, in, a, cyclotron, particle, accelerator, to, produce, after, emission, of, two, neutrons, astatine, 211, the, discoverers, however, did, not, immediately, suggest, a, name, for, the, element, the, reason, for, this, was, that, at, the, time, an, element, created, synthetically, in, invisible, quantities, that, had, not, yet, been, discovered, in, nature, was, not, seen, as, a, completely, valid, one, in, addition, chemists, were, reluctant, to, recognize, radioactive, isotopes, as, legitimately, as, stable, ones, in, 1943, astatine, was, found, as, a, product, of, two, naturally, occurring, decay, chains, by, berta, karlik, and, traude, bernert, first, in, the, so, called, uranium, series, and, then, in, the, actinium, series, since, then, astatine, was, also, found, in, a, third, decay, chain, the, neptunium, series, friedrich, paneth, in, 1946, called, to, finally, recognize, synthetic, elements, quoting, among, other, reasons, recent, confirmation, of, their, natural, occurrence, and, proposed, that, the, discoverers, of, the, newly, discovered, unnamed, elements, name, these, elements, in, early, 1947, nature, published, the, discoverers, suggestions, a, letter, from, corson, mackenzie, and, segr, suggested, the, name, astatine, coming, from, the, ancient, greek, astatos, meaning, unstable, because, of, its, propensity, for, radioactive, decay, with, the, ending, ine, found, in, the, names, of, the, four, previously, discovered, halogens, the, name, was, also, chosen, to, continue, the, tradition, of, the, four, stable, halogens, where, the, name, referred, to, a, property, of, the, element, corson, and, his, colleagues, classified, astatine, as, a, metal, on, the, basis, of, its, analytical, chemistry, subsequent, investigators, reported, iodine, like, cationic, or, amphoteric, behavior, in, a, 2003, retrospective, corson, wrote, that, some, of, the, properties, are, similar, to, iodine, it, also, exhibits, metallic, properties, more, like, its, metallic, neighbors, po, and, bi, there, are, 41, known, isotopes, of, astatine, with, mass, numbers, of, 188, and, 190, 229, theoretical, modeling, suggests, that, about, 37, more, isotopes, could, exist, no, stable, or, long, lived, astatine, isotope, has, been, observed, nor, is, one, expected, to, exist, astatine, s, alpha, decay, energies, follow, the, same, trend, as, for, other, heavy, elements, lighter, astatine, isotopes, have, quite, high, energies, of, alpha, decay, which, become, lower, as, the, nuclei, become, heavier, astatine, 211, has, a, significantly, higher, energy, than, the, previous, isotope, because, it, has, a, nucleus, with, 126, neutrons, and, 126, is, a, magic, number, corresponding, to, a, filled, neutron, shell, despite, having, a, similar, half, life, to, the, previous, isotope, 8, 1, hours, for, astatine, 210, and, 7, 2, hours, for, astatine, 211, the, alpha, decay, probability, is, much, higher, for, the, latter, 41, 81, against, only, 0, 18, the, two, following, isotopes, release, even, more, energy, with, astatine, 213, releasing, the, most, energy, for, this, reason, it, is, the, shortest, lived, astatine, isotope, even, though, heavier, astatine, isotopes, release, less, energy, no, long, lived, astatine, isotope, exists, because, of, the, increasing, role, of, beta, decay, electron, emission, this, decay, mode, is, especially, important, for, astatine, as, early, as, 1950, it, was, postulated, that, all, isotopes, of, the, element, undergo, beta, decay, though, nuclear, mass, measurements, indicate, that, 215, at, is, in, fact, beta, stable, as, it, has, the, lowest, mass, of, all, isobars, with, a, 215, astatine, 210, and, most, of, the, lighter, isotopes, exhibit, beta, plus, decay, positron, emission, astatine, 217, and, heavier, isotopes, except, astatine, 218, exhibit, beta, minus, decay, while, astatine, 211, undergoes, electron, capture, the, most, stable, isotope, is, astatine, 210, which, has, a, half, life, of, 8, 1, hours, the, primary, decay, mode, is, beta, plus, to, the, relatively, long, lived, in, comparison, to, astatine, isotopes, alpha, emitter, polonium, 210, in, total, only, five, isotopes, have, half, lives, exceeding, one, hour, astatine, 207, to, 211, the, least, stable, ground, state, isotope, is, astatine, 213, with, a, half, life, of, 125, nanoseconds, it, undergoes, alpha, decay, to, the, extremely, long, lived, bismuth, 209, astatine, has, 24, known, nuclear, isomers, which, are, nuclei, with, one, or, more, nucleons, protons, or, neutrons, in, an, excited, state, a, nuclear, isomer, may, also, be, called, a, meta, state, meaning, the, system, has, more, internal, energy, than, the, ground, state, the, state, with, the, lowest, possible, internal, energy, making, the, former, likely, to, decay, into, the, latter, there, may, be, more, than, one, isomer, for, each, isotope, the, most, stable, of, these, nuclear, isomers, is, astatine, 202m1, which, has, a, half, life, of, about, 3, minutes, longer, than, those, of, all, the, ground, states, bar, those, of, isotopes, 203, 211, and, 220, the, least, stable, is, astatine, 213m1, its, half, life, of, 110, nanoseconds, is, shorter, than, 125, nanoseconds, for, astatine, 213, the, shortest, lived, ground, state, astatine, is, the, rarest, naturally, occurring, element, the, total, amount, of, astatine, in, the, earth, s, crust, quoted, mass, 2, 36, 10, 25, grams, is, estimated, by, some, to, be, less, than, one, gram, at, any, given, time, other, sources, estimate, the, amount, of, ephemeral, astatine, present, on, earth, at, any, given, moment, to, be, up, to, one, ounce, about, 28, grams, any, astatine, present, at, the, formation, of, the, earth, has, long, since, disappeared, the, four, naturally, occurring, isotopes, astatine, 215, 217, 218, and, 219, are, instead, continuously, produced, as, a, result, of, the, decay, of, radioactive, thorium, and, uranium, ores, and, trace, quantities, of, neptunium, 237, the, landmass, of, north, and, south, america, combined, to, a, depth, of, 16, kilometers, 10, miles, contains, only, about, one, trillion, astatine, 215, atoms, at, any, given, time, around, 3, 5, 10, 10, grams, astatine, 217, is, produced, via, the, radioactive, decay, of, neptunium, 237, primordial, remnants, of, the, latter, isotope, due, to, its, relatively, short, half, life, of, 2, 14, million, years, are, no, longer, present, on, earth, however, trace, amounts, occur, naturally, as, a, product, of, transmutation, reactions, in, uranium, ores, astatine, 218, was, the, first, astatine, isotope, discovered, in, nature, astatine, 219, with, a, half, life, of, 56, seconds, is, the, longest, lived, of, the, naturally, occurring, isotopes, isotopes, of, astatine, are, sometimes, not, listed, as, naturally, occurring, because, of, misconceptions, that, there, are, no, such, isotopes, or, discrepancies, in, the, literature, astatine, 216, has, been, counted, as, a, naturally, occurring, isotope, but, reports, of, its, observation, which, were, described, as, doubtful, have, not, been, confirmed, astatine, was, first, produced, by, bombarding, bismuth, 209, with, energetic, alpha, particles, and, this, is, still, the, major, route, used, to, create, the, relatively, long, lived, isotopes, astatine, 209, through, astatine, 211, astatine, is, only, produced, in, minuscule, quantities, with, modern, techniques, allowing, production, runs, of, up, to, 6, 6, gigabecquerels, about, 86, nanograms, or, 2, 47, 10, 14, atoms, synthesis, of, greater, quantities, of, astatine, using, this, method, is, constrained, by, the, limited, availability, of, suitable, cyclotrons, and, the, prospect, of, melting, the, target, solvent, radiolysis, due, to, the, cumulative, effect, of, astatine, decay, is, a, related, problem, with, cryogenic, technology, microgram, quantities, of, astatine, might, be, able, to, be, generated, via, proton, irradiation, of, thorium, or, uranium, to, yield, radon, 211, in, turn, decaying, to, astatine, 211, contamination, with, astatine, 210, is, expected, to, be, a, drawback, of, this, method, the, most, important, isotope, is, astatine, 211, the, only, one, in, commercial, use, to, produce, the, bismuth, target, the, metal, is, sputtered, onto, a, gold, copper, or, aluminium, surface, at, 50, to, 100, milligrams, per, square, centimeter, bismuth, oxide, can, be, used, instead, this, is, forcibly, fused, with, a, copper, plate, the, target, is, kept, under, a, chemically, neutral, nitrogen, atmosphere, and, is, cooled, with, water, to, prevent, premature, astatine, vaporization, in, a, particle, accelerator, such, as, a, cyclotron, alpha, particles, are, collided, with, the, bismuth, even, though, only, one, bismuth, isotope, is, used, bismuth, 209, the, reaction, may, occur, in, three, possible, ways, producing, astatine, 209, astatine, 210, or, astatine, 211, in, order, to, eliminate, undesired, nuclides, the, maximum, energy, of, the, particle, accelerator, is, set, to, a, value, optimally, 29, 17, mev, above, that, for, the, reaction, producing, astatine, 211, to, produce, the, desired, isotope, and, below, the, one, producing, astatine, 210, to, avoid, producing, other, astatine, isotopes, since, astatine, is, the, main, product, of, the, synthesis, after, its, formation, it, must, only, be, separated, from, the, target, and, any, significant, contaminants, several, methods, are, available, but, they, generally, follow, one, of, two, approaches, dry, distillation, or, acid, treatment, of, the, target, followed, by, solvent, extraction, the, methods, summarized, below, are, modern, adaptations, of, older, procedures, as, reviewed, by, kugler, and, keller, pre, 1985, techniques, more, often, addressed, the, elimination, of, co, produced, toxic, polonium, this, requirement, is, now, mitigated, by, capping, the, energy, of, the, cyclotron, irradiation, beam, the, astatine, containing, cyclotron, target, is, heated, to, a, temperature, of, around, 650, c, the, astatine, volatilizes, and, is, condensed, in, typically, a, cold, trap, higher, temperatures, of, up, to, around, 850, c, may, increase, the, yield, at, the, risk, of, bismuth, contamination, from, concurrent, volatilization, redistilling, the, condensate, may, be, required, to, minimize, the, presence, of, bismuth, as, bismuth, can, interfere, with, astatine, labeling, reactions, the, astatine, is, recovered, from, the, trap, using, one, or, more, low, concentration, solvents, such, as, sodium, hydroxide, methanol, or, chloroform, astatine, yields, of, up, to, around, 80, may, be, achieved, dry, separation, is, the, method, most, commonly, used, to, produce, a, chemically, useful, form, of, astatine, the, irradiated, bismuth, or, sometimes, bismuth, trioxide, target, is, first, dissolved, in, for, example, concentrated, nitric, or, perchloric, acid, following, this, first, step, the, acid, can, be, distilled, away, to, leave, behind, a, white, residue, that, contains, both, bismuth, and, the, desired, astatine, product, this, residue, is, then, dissolved, in, a, concentrated, acid, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, astatine, is, extracted, from, this, acid, using, an, organic, solvent, such, as, dibutyl, ether, diisopropyl, ether, dipe, or, thiosemicarbazide, using, liquid, liquid, extraction, the, astatine, product, can, be, repeatedly, washed, with, an, acid, such, as, hcl, and, extracted, into, the, organic, solvent, layer, a, separation, yield, of, 93, using, nitric, acid, has, been, reported, falling, to, 72, by, the, time, purification, procedures, were, completed, distillation, of, nitric, acid, purging, residual, nitrogen, oxides, and, redissolving, bismuth, nitrate, to, enable, liquid, liquid, extraction, wet, methods, involve, multiple, radioactivity, handling, steps, and, have, not, been, considered, well, suited, for, isolating, larger, quantities, of, astatine, however, wet, extraction, methods, are, being, examined, for, use, in, production, of, larger, quantities, of, astatine, 211, as, it, is, thought, that, wet, extraction, methods, can, provide, more, consistency, they, can, enable, the, production, of, astatine, in, a, specific, oxidation, state, and, may, have, greater, applicability, in, experimental, radiochemistry, newly, formed, astatine, 211, is, the, subject, of, ongoing, research, in, nuclear, medicine, it, must, be, used, quickly, as, it, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 7, 2, hours, this, is, long, enough, to, permit, multistep, labeling, strategies, astatine, 211, has, potential, for, targeted, alpha, particle, therapy, since, it, decays, either, via, emission, of, an, alpha, particle, to, bismuth, 207, or, via, electron, capture, to, an, extremely, short, lived, nuclide, polonium, 211, which, undergoes, further, alpha, decay, very, quickly, reaching, its, stable, granddaughter, lead, 207, polonium, x, rays, emitted, as, a, result, of, the, electron, capture, branch, in, the, range, of, 77, 92, kev, enable, the, tracking, of, astatine, in, animals, and, patients, although, astatine, 210, has, a, slightly, longer, half, life, it, is, wholly, unsuitable, because, it, usually, undergoes, beta, plus, decay, to, the, extremely, toxic, polonium, 210, the, principal, medicinal, difference, between, astatine, 211, and, iodine, 131, a, radioactive, iodine, isotope, also, used, in, medicine, is, that, iodine, 131, emits, high, energy, beta, particles, and, astatine, does, not, beta, particles, have, much, greater, penetrating, power, through, tissues, than, do, the, much, heavier, alpha, particles, an, average, alpha, particle, released, by, astatine, 211, can, travel, up, to, 70, m, through, surrounding, tissues, an, average, energy, beta, particle, emitted, by, iodine, 131, can, travel, nearly, 30, times, as, far, to, about, 2, mm, the, short, half, life, and, limited, penetrating, power, of, alpha, radiation, through, tissues, offers, advantages, in, situations, where, the, tumor, burden, is, low, and, or, malignant, cell, populations, are, located, in, close, proximity, to, essential, normal, tissues, significant, morbidity, in, cell, culture, models, of, human, cancers, has, been, achieved, with, from, one, to, ten, astatine, 211, atoms, bound, per, cell, astatine, miserable, to, make, and, hell, to, work, with, p, durbin, human, radiation, studies, remembering, the, early, years, 1995, several, obstacles, have, been, encountered, in, the, development, of, astatine, based, radiopharmaceuticals, for, cancer, treatment, world, war, ii, delayed, research, for, close, to, a, decade, results, of, early, experiments, indicated, that, a, cancer, selective, carrier, would, need, to, be, developed, and, it, was, not, until, the, 1970s, that, monoclonal, antibodies, became, available, for, this, purpose, unlike, iodine, astatine, shows, a, tendency, to, dehalogenate, from, molecular, carriers, such, as, these, particularly, at, sp, 3, carbon, sites, less, so, from, sp, 2, sites, given, the, toxicity, of, astatine, accumulated, and, retained, in, the, body, this, emphasized, the, need, to, ensure, it, remained, attached, to, its, host, molecule, while, astatine, carriers, that, are, slowly, metabolized, can, be, assessed, for, their, efficacy, more, rapidly, metabolized, carriers, remain, a, significant, obstacle, to, the, evaluation, of, astatine, in, nuclear, medicine, mitigating, the, effects, of, astatine, induced, radiolysis, of, labeling, chemistry, and, carrier, molecules, is, another, area, requiring, further, development, a, practical, application, for, astatine, as, a, cancer, treatment, would, potentially, be, suitable, for, a, staggering, number, of, patients, production, of, astatine, in, the, quantities, that, would, be, required, remains, an, issue, animal, studies, show, that, astatine, similarly, to, iodine, although, to, a, lesser, extent, perhaps, because, of, its, slightly, more, metallic, nature, is, preferentially, and, dangerously, concentrated, in, the, thyroid, gland, unlike, iodine, astatine, also, shows, a, tendency, to, be, taken, up, by, the, lungs, and, spleen, possibly, because, of, in, body, oxidation, of, at, to, at, if, administered, in, the, form, of, a, radiocolloid, it, tends, to, concentrate, in, the, liver, experiments, in, rats, and, monkeys, suggest, that, astatine, 211, causes, much, greater, damage, to, the, thyroid, gland, than, does, iodine, 131, with, repetitive, injection, of, the, nuclide, resulting, in, necrosis, and, cell, dysplasia, within, the, gland, early, research, suggested, that, injection, of, astatine, into, female, rodents, caused, morphological, changes, in, breast, tissue, this, conclusion, remained, controversial, for, many, years, general, agreement, was, later, reached, that, this, was, likely, caused, by, the, effect, of, breast, tissue, irradiation, combined, with, hormonal, changes, due, to, irradiation, of, the, ovaries, trace, amounts, of, astatine, can, be, handled, safely, in, fume, hoods, if, they, are, well, aerated, biological, uptake, of, the, element, must, be, avoided
