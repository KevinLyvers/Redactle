gas, is, one, of, the, four, fundamental, states, of, matter, the, others, are, solid, liquid, and, plasma, a, pure, gas, may, be, made, up, of, individual, atoms, e, g, a, noble, gas, like, neon, elemental, molecules, made, from, one, type, of, atom, e, g, oxygen, or, compound, molecules, made, from, a, variety, of, atoms, e, g, carbon, dioxide, a, gas, mixture, such, as, air, contains, a, variety, of, pure, gases, what, distinguishes, gases, from, liquids, and, solids, is, the, vast, separation, of, the, individual, gas, particles, this, separation, usually, makes, a, colorless, gas, invisible, to, the, human, observer, the, gaseous, state, of, matter, occurs, between, the, liquid, and, plasma, states, the, latter, of, which, provides, the, upper, temperature, boundary, for, gases, bounding, the, lower, end, of, the, temperature, scale, lie, degenerative, quantum, gases, which, are, gaining, increasing, attention, high, density, atomic, gases, super, cooled, to, very, low, temperatures, are, classified, by, their, statistical, behavior, as, either, bose, gases, or, fermi, gases, for, a, comprehensive, listing, of, these, exotic, states, of, matter, see, list, of, states, of, matter, the, only, chemical, elements, that, are, stable, diatomic, homonuclear, molecular, gases, at, stp, are, hydrogen, h, 2, nitrogen, n, 2, oxygen, o, 2, and, two, halogens, fluorine, f, 2, and, chlorine, cl, 2, when, grouped, with, the, monatomic, noble, gases, helium, he, neon, ne, argon, ar, krypton, kr, xenon, xe, and, radon, rn, these, gases, are, referred, to, as, elemental, gases, the, word, gas, was, first, used, by, the, early, 17th, century, flemish, chemist, jan, baptist, van, helmont, he, identified, carbon, dioxide, the, first, known, gas, other, than, air, van, helmont, s, word, appears, to, have, been, simply, a, phonetic, transcription, of, the, ancient, greek, word, chaos, the, g, in, dutch, being, pronounced, like, ch, in, loch, voiceless, velar, fricative, x, in, which, case, van, helmont, simply, was, following, the, established, alchemical, usage, first, attested, in, the, works, of, paracelsus, according, to, paracelsus, s, terminology, chaos, meant, something, like, ultra, rarefied, water, an, alternative, story, is, that, van, helmont, s, term, was, derived, from, gahst, or, geist, which, signifies, a, ghost, or, spirit, that, story, is, given, no, credence, by, the, editors, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, contrast, the, french, american, historian, jacques, barzun, speculated, that, van, helmont, had, borrowed, the, word, from, the, german, g, scht, meaning, the, froth, resulting, from, fermentation, because, most, gases, are, difficult, to, observe, directly, they, are, described, through, the, use, of, four, physical, properties, or, macroscopic, characteristics, pressure, volume, number, of, particles, chemists, group, them, by, moles, and, temperature, these, four, characteristics, were, repeatedly, observed, by, scientists, such, as, robert, boyle, jacques, charles, john, dalton, joseph, gay, lussac, and, amedeo, avogadro, for, a, variety, of, gases, in, various, settings, their, detailed, studies, ultimately, led, to, a, mathematical, relationship, among, these, properties, expressed, by, the, ideal, gas, law, see, ideal, and, perfect, gas, section, below, gas, particles, are, widely, separated, from, one, another, and, consequently, have, weaker, intermolecular, bonds, than, liquids, or, solids, these, intermolecular, forces, result, from, electrostatic, interactions, between, gas, particles, like, charged, areas, of, different, gas, particles, repel, while, oppositely, charged, regions, of, different, gas, particles, attract, one, another, gases, that, contain, permanently, charged, ions, are, known, as, plasmas, gaseous, compounds, with, polar, covalent, bonds, contain, permanent, charge, imbalances, and, so, experience, relatively, strong, intermolecular, forces, although, the, compound, s, net, charge, remains, neutral, transient, randomly, induced, charges, exist, across, non, polar, covalent, bonds, of, molecules, and, electrostatic, interactions, caused, by, them, are, referred, to, as, van, der, waals, forces, the, interaction, of, these, intermolecular, forces, varies, within, a, substance, which, determines, many, of, the, physical, properties, unique, to, each, gas, a, comparison, of, boiling, points, for, compounds, formed, by, ionic, and, covalent, bonds, leads, us, to, this, conclusion, compared, to, the, other, states, of, matter, gases, have, low, density, and, viscosity, pressure, and, temperature, influence, the, particles, within, a, certain, volume, this, variation, in, particle, separation, and, speed, is, referred, to, as, compressibility, this, particle, separation, and, size, influences, optical, properties, of, gases, as, can, be, found, in, the, following, list, of, refractive, indices, finally, gas, particles, spread, apart, or, diffuse, in, order, to, homogeneously, distribute, themselves, throughout, any, container, when, observing, gas, it, is, typical, to, specify, a, frame, of, reference, or, length, scale, a, larger, length, scale, corresponds, to, a, macroscopic, or, global, point, of, view, of, the, gas, this, region, referred, to, as, a, volume, must, be, sufficient, in, size, to, contain, a, large, sampling, of, gas, particles, the, resulting, statistical, analysis, of, this, sample, size, produces, the, average, behavior, i, e, velocity, temperature, or, pressure, of, all, the, gas, particles, within, the, region, in, contrast, a, smaller, length, scale, corresponds, to, a, microscopic, or, particle, point, of, view, macroscopically, the, gas, characteristics, measured, are, either, in, terms, of, the, gas, particles, themselves, velocity, pressure, or, temperature, or, their, surroundings, volume, for, example, robert, boyle, studied, pneumatic, chemistry, for, a, small, portion, of, his, career, one, of, his, experiments, related, the, macroscopic, properties, of, pressure, and, volume, of, a, gas, his, experiment, used, a, j, tube, manometer, which, looks, like, a, test, tube, in, the, shape, of, the, letter, j, boyle, trapped, an, inert, gas, in, the, closed, end, of, the, test, tube, with, a, column, of, mercury, thereby, making, the, number, of, particles, and, the, temperature, constant, he, observed, that, when, the, pressure, was, increased, in, the, gas, by, adding, more, mercury, to, the, column, the, trapped, gas, volume, decreased, this, is, known, as, an, inverse, relationship, furthermore, when, boyle, multiplied, the, pressure, and, volume, of, each, observation, the, product, was, constant, this, relationship, held, for, every, gas, that, boyle, observed, leading, to, the, law, pv, k, named, to, honor, his, work, in, this, field, there, are, many, mathematical, tools, available, for, analyzing, gas, properties, boyle, s, lab, equipment, allowed, the, use, of, just, a, simple, calculation, to, obtain, his, analytical, results, his, results, were, possible, because, he, was, studying, gases, in, relatively, low, pressure, situations, where, they, behaved, in, an, ideal, manner, these, ideal, relationships, apply, to, safety, calculations, for, a, variety, of, flight, conditions, on, the, materials, in, use, however, the, high, technology, equipment, in, use, today, was, designed, to, help, us, safely, explore, the, more, exotic, operating, environments, where, the, gases, no, longer, behave, in, an, ideal, manner, as, gases, are, subjected, to, extreme, conditions, tools, to, interpret, them, become, more, complex, from, the, euler, equations, for, inviscid, flow, to, the, navier, stokes, equations, that, fully, account, for, viscous, effects, this, advanced, math, including, statistics, and, multivariable, calculus, adapted, to, the, conditions, of, the, gas, system, in, question, makes, it, possible, to, solve, such, complex, dynamic, situations, as, space, vehicle, reentry, an, example, is, the, analysis, of, the, space, shuttle, reentry, pictured, to, ensure, the, material, properties, under, this, loading, condition, are, appropriate, in, this, flight, situation, the, gas, is, no, longer, behaving, ideally, the, symbol, used, to, represent, pressure, in, equations, is, p, or, p, with, si, units, of, pascals, when, describing, a, container, of, gas, the, term, pressure, or, absolute, pressure, refers, to, the, average, force, per, unit, area, that, the, gas, exerts, on, the, surface, of, the, container, within, this, volume, it, is, sometimes, easier, to, visualize, the, gas, particles, moving, in, straight, lines, until, they, collide, with, the, container, see, diagram, at, top, the, force, imparted, by, a, gas, particle, into, the, container, during, this, collision, is, the, change, in, momentum, of, the, particle, during, a, collision, only, the, normal, component, of, velocity, changes, a, particle, traveling, parallel, to, the, wall, does, not, change, its, momentum, therefore, the, average, force, on, a, surface, must, be, the, average, change, in, linear, momentum, from, all, of, these, gas, particle, collisions, pressure, is, the, sum, of, all, the, normal, components, of, force, exerted, by, the, particles, impacting, the, walls, of, the, container, divided, by, the, surface, area, of, the, wall, the, symbol, used, to, represent, temperature, in, equations, is, t, with, si, units, of, kelvins, the, speed, of, a, gas, particle, is, proportional, to, its, absolute, temperature, the, volume, of, the, balloon, in, the, video, shrinks, when, the, trapped, gas, particles, slow, down, with, the, addition, of, extremely, cold, nitrogen, the, temperature, of, any, physical, system, is, related, to, the, motions, of, the, particles, molecules, and, atoms, which, make, up, the, system, in, statistical, mechanics, temperature, is, the, measure, of, the, average, kinetic, energy, stored, in, a, molecule, also, known, as, the, thermal, energy, the, methods, of, storing, this, energy, are, dictated, by, the, degrees, of, freedom, of, the, molecule, itself, energy, modes, thermal, kinetic, energy, added, to, a, gas, or, liquid, an, endothermic, process, produces, translational, rotational, and, vibrational, motion, in, contrast, a, solid, can, only, increase, its, internal, energy, by, exciting, additional, vibrational, modes, as, the, crystal, lattice, structure, prevents, both, translational, and, rotational, motion, these, heated, gas, molecules, have, a, greater, speed, range, wider, distribution, of, speeds, with, a, higher, average, or, mean, speed, the, variance, of, this, distribution, is, due, to, the, speeds, of, individual, particles, constantly, varying, due, to, repeated, collisions, with, other, particles, the, speed, range, can, be, described, by, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, use, of, this, distribution, implies, ideal, gases, near, thermodynamic, equilibrium, for, the, system, of, particles, being, considered, the, symbol, used, to, represent, specific, volume, in, equations, is, v, with, si, units, of, cubic, meters, per, kilogram, the, symbol, used, to, represent, volume, in, equations, is, v, with, si, units, of, cubic, meters, when, performing, a, thermodynamic, analysis, it, is, typical, to, speak, of, intensive, and, extensive, properties, properties, which, depend, on, the, amount, of, gas, either, by, mass, or, volume, are, called, extensive, properties, while, properties, that, do, not, depend, on, the, amount, of, gas, are, called, intensive, properties, specific, volume, is, an, example, of, an, intensive, property, because, it, is, the, ratio, of, volume, occupied, by, a, unit, of, mass, of, a, gas, that, is, identical, throughout, a, system, at, equilibrium, 1000, atoms, a, gas, occupy, the, same, space, as, any, other, 1000, atoms, for, any, given, temperature, and, pressure, this, concept, is, easier, to, visualize, for, solids, such, as, iron, which, are, incompressible, compared, to, gases, however, volume, itself, not, specific, is, an, extensive, property, the, symbol, used, to, represent, density, in, equations, is, rho, with, si, units, of, kilograms, per, cubic, meter, this, term, is, the, reciprocal, of, specific, volume, since, gas, molecules, can, move, freely, within, a, container, their, mass, is, normally, characterized, by, density, density, is, the, amount, of, mass, per, unit, volume, of, a, substance, or, the, inverse, of, specific, volume, for, gases, the, density, can, vary, over, a, wide, range, because, the, particles, are, free, to, move, closer, together, when, constrained, by, pressure, or, volume, this, variation, of, density, is, referred, to, as, compressibility, like, pressure, and, temperature, density, is, a, state, variable, of, a, gas, and, the, change, in, density, during, any, process, is, governed, by, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, for, a, static, gas, the, density, is, the, same, throughout, the, entire, container, density, is, therefore, a, scalar, quantity, it, can, be, shown, by, kinetic, theory, that, the, density, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, size, of, the, container, in, which, a, fixed, mass, of, gas, is, confined, in, this, case, of, a, fixed, mass, the, density, decreases, as, the, volume, increases, if, one, could, observe, a, gas, under, a, powerful, microscope, one, would, see, a, collection, of, particles, without, any, definite, shape, or, volume, that, are, in, more, or, less, random, motion, these, gas, particles, only, change, direction, when, they, collide, with, another, particle, or, with, the, sides, of, the, container, this, microscopic, view, of, gas, is, well, described, by, statistical, mechanics, but, it, can, be, described, by, many, different, theories, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, which, makes, the, assumption, that, these, collisions, are, perfectly, elastic, does, not, account, for, intermolecular, forces, of, attraction, and, repulsion, kinetic, theory, provides, insight, into, the, macroscopic, properties, of, gases, by, considering, their, molecular, composition, and, motion, starting, with, the, definitions, of, momentum, and, kinetic, energy, one, can, use, the, conservation, of, momentum, and, geometric, relationships, of, a, cube, to, relate, macroscopic, system, properties, of, temperature, and, pressure, to, the, microscopic, property, of, kinetic, energy, per, molecule, the, theory, provides, averaged, values, for, these, two, properties, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, can, help, explain, how, the, system, the, collection, of, gas, particles, being, considered, responds, to, changes, in, temperature, with, a, corresponding, change, in, kinetic, energy, for, example, imagine, you, have, a, sealed, container, of, a, fixed, size, a, constant, volume, containing, a, fixed, number, of, gas, particles, starting, from, absolute, zero, the, theoretical, temperature, at, which, atoms, or, molecules, have, no, thermal, energy, i, e, are, not, moving, or, vibrating, you, begin, to, add, energy, to, the, system, by, heating, the, container, so, that, energy, transfers, to, the, particles, inside, once, their, internal, energy, is, above, zero, point, energy, meaning, their, kinetic, energy, also, known, as, thermal, energy, is, non, zero, the, gas, particles, will, begin, to, move, around, the, container, as, the, box, is, further, heated, as, more, energy, is, added, the, individual, particles, increase, their, average, speed, as, the, system, s, total, internal, energy, increases, the, higher, average, speed, of, all, the, particles, leads, to, a, greater, rate, at, which, collisions, happen, i, e, greater, number, of, collisions, per, unit, of, time, between, particles, and, the, container, as, well, as, between, the, particles, themselves, the, macro, scopic, measurable, quantity, of, pressure, is, the, direct, result, of, these, micro, scopic, particle, collisions, with, the, surface, over, which, individual, molecules, exert, a, small, force, each, contributing, to, the, total, force, applied, within, a, specific, area, read, pressure, likewise, the, macroscopically, measurable, quantity, of, temperature, is, a, quantification, of, the, overall, amount, of, motion, or, kinetic, energy, that, the, particles, exhibit, read, temperature, in, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, kinetic, energy, is, assumed, to, purely, consist, of, linear, translations, according, to, a, speed, distribution, of, particles, in, the, system, however, in, real, gases, and, other, real, substances, the, motions, which, define, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, system, which, collectively, determine, the, temperature, are, much, more, complex, than, simple, linear, translation, due, to, the, more, complex, structure, of, molecules, compared, to, single, atoms, which, act, similarly, to, point, masses, in, real, thermodynamic, systems, quantum, phenomena, play, a, large, role, in, determining, thermal, motions, the, random, thermal, motions, kinetic, energy, in, molecules, is, a, combination, of, a, finite, set, of, possible, motions, including, translation, rotation, and, vibration, this, finite, range, of, possible, motions, along, with, the, finite, set, of, molecules, in, the, system, leads, to, a, finite, number, of, microstates, within, the, system, we, call, the, set, of, all, microstates, an, ensemble, specific, to, atomic, or, molecular, systems, we, could, potentially, have, three, different, kinds, of, ensemble, depending, on, the, situation, microcanonical, ensemble, canonical, ensemble, or, grand, canonical, ensemble, specific, combinations, of, microstates, within, an, ensemble, are, how, we, truly, define, macrostate, of, the, system, temperature, pressure, energy, etc, in, order, to, do, that, we, must, first, count, all, microstates, though, use, of, a, partition, function, the, use, of, statistical, mechanics, and, the, partition, function, is, an, important, tool, throughout, all, of, physical, chemistry, because, it, is, the, key, to, connection, between, the, microscopic, states, of, a, system, and, the, macroscopic, variables, which, we, can, measure, such, as, temperature, pressure, heat, capacity, internal, energy, enthalpy, and, entropy, just, to, name, a, few, read, partition, function, meaning, and, significance, using, the, partition, function, to, find, the, energy, of, a, molecule, or, system, of, molecules, can, sometimes, be, approximated, by, the, equipartition, theorem, which, greatly, simplifies, calculation, however, this, method, assumes, all, molecular, degrees, of, freedom, are, equally, populated, and, therefore, equally, utilized, for, storing, energy, within, the, molecule, it, would, imply, that, internal, energy, changes, linearly, with, temperature, which, is, not, the, case, this, ignores, the, fact, that, heat, capacity, changes, with, temperature, due, to, certain, degrees, of, freedom, being, unreachable, a, k, a, frozen, out, at, lower, temperatures, as, internal, energy, of, molecules, increases, so, does, the, ability, to, store, energy, within, additional, degrees, of, freedom, as, more, degrees, of, freedom, become, available, to, hold, energy, this, causes, the, molar, heat, capacity, of, the, substance, to, increase, brownian, motion, is, the, mathematical, model, used, to, describe, the, random, movement, of, particles, suspended, in, a, fluid, the, gas, particle, animation, using, pink, and, green, particles, illustrates, how, this, behavior, results, in, the, spreading, out, of, gases, entropy, these, events, are, also, described, by, particle, theory, since, it, is, at, the, limit, of, or, beyond, current, technology, to, observe, individual, gas, particles, atoms, or, molecules, only, theoretical, calculations, give, suggestions, about, how, they, move, but, their, motion, is, different, from, brownian, motion, because, brownian, motion, involves, a, smooth, drag, due, to, the, frictional, force, of, many, gas, molecules, punctuated, by, violent, collisions, of, an, individual, or, several, gas, molecule, s, with, the, particle, the, particle, generally, consisting, of, millions, or, billions, of, atoms, thus, moves, in, a, jagged, course, yet, not, so, jagged, as, would, be, expected, if, an, individual, gas, molecule, were, examined, forces, between, two, or, more, molecules, or, atoms, either, attractive, or, repulsive, are, called, intermolecular, forces, intermolecular, forces, are, experienced, by, molecules, when, they, are, within, physical, proximity, of, one, another, these, forces, are, very, important, for, properly, modeling, molecular, systems, as, to, accurately, predict, the, microscopic, behavior, of, molecules, in, any, system, and, therefore, are, necessary, for, accurately, predicting, the, physical, properties, of, gases, and, liquids, across, wide, variations, in, physical, conditions, arising, from, the, study, of, physical, chemistry, one, of, the, most, prominent, intermolecular, forces, throughout, physics, are, van, der, waals, forces, van, der, waals, forces, play, a, key, role, in, determining, nearly, all, physical, properties, of, fluids, such, as, viscosity, flow, rate, and, gas, dynamics, see, physical, characteristics, section, the, van, der, waals, interactions, between, gas, molecules, is, the, reason, why, modeling, a, real, gas, is, more, mathematically, difficult, than, an, ideal, gas, ignoring, these, proximity, dependent, forces, allows, a, real, gas, to, be, treated, like, an, ideal, gas, which, greatly, simplifies, calculation, the, intermolecular, attractions, and, repulsions, between, two, gas, molecules, depend, on, the, distance, between, them, the, combined, attractions, and, repulsions, are, well, modelled, by, the, lennard, jones, potential, which, is, one, of, the, most, extensively, studied, of, all, interatomic, potentials, describing, the, potential, energy, of, molecular, systems, due, to, the, general, applicability, and, importance, the, lennard, jones, model, system, is, often, referred, to, as, lennard, jonesium, the, lennard, jones, potential, between, molecules, can, be, broken, down, into, two, separate, components, a, long, distance, attraction, due, to, the, london, dispersion, force, and, a, short, range, repulsion, due, to, electron, electron, exchange, interaction, which, is, related, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, when, two, molecules, are, relatively, distant, meaning, they, have, a, high, potential, energy, they, experience, a, weak, attracting, force, causing, them, to, move, toward, each, other, lowering, their, potential, energy, however, if, the, molecules, are, too, far, away, then, they, would, not, experience, attractive, force, of, any, significance, additionally, if, the, molecules, get, too, close, then, they, will, collide, and, experience, a, very, high, repulsive, force, modelled, by, hard, spheres, which, is, a, much, stronger, force, than, the, attractions, so, that, any, attraction, due, to, proximity, is, disregarded, as, two, molecules, approach, each, other, from, a, distance, that, is, neither, too, far, nor, too, close, their, attraction, increases, as, the, magnitude, of, their, potential, energy, increases, becoming, more, negative, and, lowers, their, total, internal, energy, the, attraction, causing, the, molecules, to, get, closer, can, only, happen, if, the, molecules, remain, in, proximity, for, the, duration, of, time, it, takes, to, physically, move, closer, therefore, the, attractive, forces, are, strongest, when, the, molecules, move, at, low, speeds, this, means, that, the, attraction, between, molecules, is, significant, when, gas, temperatures, is, low, however, if, you, were, to, isothermally, compress, this, cold, gas, into, a, small, volume, forcing, the, molecules, into, close, proximity, and, raising, the, pressure, the, repulsions, will, begin, to, dominate, over, the, attractions, as, the, rate, at, which, collisions, are, happening, will, increase, significantly, therefore, at, low, temperatures, and, low, pressures, attraction, is, the, dominant, intermolecular, interaction, if, two, molecules, are, moving, at, high, speeds, in, arbitrary, directions, along, non, intersecting, paths, then, they, will, not, spend, enough, time, in, proximity, to, be, affected, by, the, attractive, london, dispersion, force, if, the, two, molecules, collide, they, are, moving, too, fast, and, their, kinetic, energy, will, be, much, greater, than, any, attractive, potential, energy, so, they, will, only, experience, repulsion, upon, colliding, thus, attractions, between, molecules, can, be, neglected, at, high, temperatures, due, to, high, speeds, at, high, temperatures, and, high, pressures, repulsion, is, the, dominant, intermolecular, interaction, accounting, for, the, above, stated, effects, which, cause, these, attractions, and, repulsions, real, gases, delineate, from, the, ideal, gas, model, by, the, following, generalization, an, equation, of, state, for, gases, is, a, mathematical, model, used, to, roughly, describe, or, predict, the, state, properties, of, a, gas, at, present, there, is, no, single, equation, of, state, that, accurately, predicts, the, properties, of, all, gases, under, all, conditions, therefore, a, number, of, much, more, accurate, equations, of, state, have, been, developed, for, gases, in, specific, temperature, and, pressure, ranges, the, gas, models, that, are, most, widely, discussed, are, perfect, gas, ideal, gas, and, real, gas, each, of, these, models, has, its, own, set, of, assumptions, to, facilitate, the, analysis, of, a, given, thermodynamic, system, each, successive, model, expands, the, temperature, range, of, coverage, to, which, it, applies, the, equation, of, state, for, an, ideal, or, perfect, gas, is, the, ideal, gas, law, and, reads, where, p, is, the, pressure, v, is, the, volume, n, is, amount, of, gas, in, mol, units, r, is, the, universal, gas, constant, 8, 314, j, mol, k, and, t, is, the, temperature, written, this, way, it, is, sometimes, called, the, chemist, s, version, since, it, emphasizes, the, number, of, molecules, n, it, can, also, be, written, as, where, r, s, displaystyle, r, s, is, the, specific, gas, constant, for, a, particular, gas, in, units, j, kg, k, and, m, v, is, density, this, notation, is, the, gas, dynamicist, s, version, which, is, more, practical, in, modeling, of, gas, flows, involving, acceleration, without, chemical, reactions, the, ideal, gas, law, does, not, make, an, assumption, about, the, heat, capacity, of, a, gas, in, the, most, general, case, the, specific, heat, is, a, function, of, both, temperature, and, pressure, if, the, pressure, dependence, is, neglected, and, possibly, the, temperature, dependence, as, well, in, a, particular, application, sometimes, the, gas, is, said, to, be, a, perfect, gas, although, the, exact, assumptions, may, vary, depending, on, the, author, and, or, field, of, science, for, an, ideal, gas, the, ideal, gas, law, applies, without, restrictions, on, the, specific, heat, an, ideal, gas, is, a, simplified, real, gas, with, the, assumption, that, the, compressibility, factor, z, is, set, to, 1, meaning, that, this, pneumatic, ratio, remains, constant, a, compressibility, factor, of, one, also, requires, the, four, state, variables, to, follow, the, ideal, gas, law, this, approximation, is, more, suitable, for, applications, in, engineering, although, simpler, models, can, be, used, to, produce, a, ball, park, range, as, to, where, the, real, solution, should, lie, an, example, where, the, ideal, gas, approximation, would, be, suitable, would, be, inside, a, combustion, chamber, of, a, jet, engine, it, may, also, be, useful, to, keep, the, elementary, reactions, and, chemical, dissociations, for, calculating, emissions, each, one, of, the, assumptions, listed, below, adds, to, the, complexity, of, the, problem, s, solution, as, the, density, of, a, gas, increases, with, rising, pressure, the, intermolecular, forces, play, a, more, substantial, role, in, gas, behavior, which, results, in, the, ideal, gas, law, no, longer, providing, reasonable, results, at, the, upper, end, of, the, engine, temperature, ranges, e, g, combustor, sections, 1300, k, the, complex, fuel, particles, absorb, internal, energy, by, means, of, rotations, and, vibrations, that, cause, their, specific, heats, to, vary, from, those, of, diatomic, molecules, and, noble, gases, at, more, than, double, that, temperature, electronic, excitation, and, dissociation, of, the, gas, particles, begins, to, occur, causing, the, pressure, to, adjust, to, a, greater, number, of, particles, transition, from, gas, to, plasma, finally, all, of, the, thermodynamic, processes, were, presumed, to, describe, uniform, gases, whose, velocities, varied, according, to, a, fixed, distribution, using, a, non, equilibrium, situation, implies, the, flow, field, must, be, characterized, in, some, manner, to, enable, a, solution, one, of, the, first, attempts, to, expand, the, boundaries, of, the, ideal, gas, law, was, to, include, coverage, for, different, thermodynamic, processes, by, adjusting, the, equation, to, read, pv, n, constant, and, then, varying, the, n, through, different, values, such, as, the, specific, heat, ratio, real, gas, effects, include, those, adjustments, made, to, account, for, a, greater, range, of, gas, behavior, for, most, applications, such, a, detailed, analysis, is, excessive, examples, where, real, gas, effects, would, have, a, significant, impact, would, be, on, the, space, shuttle, re, entry, where, extremely, high, temperatures, and, pressures, were, present, or, the, gases, produced, during, geological, events, as, in, the, image, of, the, 1990, eruption, of, mount, redoubt, permanent, gas, is, a, term, used, for, a, gas, which, has, a, critical, temperature, below, the, range, of, normal, human, habitable, temperatures, and, therefore, cannot, be, liquefied, by, pressure, within, this, range, historically, such, gases, were, thought, to, be, impossible, to, liquefy, and, would, therefore, permanently, remain, in, the, gaseous, state, the, term, is, relevant, to, ambient, temperature, storage, and, transport, of, gases, at, high, pressure, boyle, s, law, was, perhaps, the, first, expression, of, an, equation, of, state, in, 1662, robert, boyle, performed, a, series, of, experiments, employing, a, j, shaped, glass, tube, which, was, sealed, on, one, end, mercury, was, added, to, the, tube, trapping, a, fixed, quantity, of, air, in, the, short, sealed, end, of, the, tube, then, the, volume, of, gas, was, carefully, measured, as, additional, mercury, was, added, to, the, tube, the, pressure, of, the, gas, could, be, determined, by, the, difference, between, the, mercury, level, in, the, short, end, of, the, tube, and, that, in, the, long, open, end, the, image, of, boyle, s, equipment, shows, some, of, the, exotic, tools, used, by, boyle, during, his, study, of, gases, through, these, experiments, boyle, noted, that, the, pressure, exerted, by, a, gas, held, at, a, constant, temperature, varies, inversely, with, the, volume, of, the, gas, for, example, if, the, volume, is, halved, the, pressure, is, doubled, and, if, the, volume, is, doubled, the, pressure, is, halved, given, the, inverse, relationship, between, pressure, and, volume, the, product, of, pressure, p, and, volume, v, is, a, constant, k, for, a, given, mass, of, confined, gas, as, long, as, the, temperature, is, constant, stated, as, a, formula, thus, is, because, the, before, and, after, volumes, and, pressures, of, the, fixed, amount, of, gas, where, the, before, and, after, temperatures, are, the, same, both, equal, the, constant, k, they, can, be, related, by, the, equation, p, 1, v, 1, p, 2, v, 2, displaystyle, qquad, p, 1, v, 1, p, 2, v, 2, in, 1787, the, french, physicist, and, balloon, pioneer, jacques, charles, found, that, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, dioxide, and, air, expand, to, the, same, extent, over, the, same, 80, kelvin, interval, he, noted, that, for, an, ideal, gas, at, constant, pressure, the, volume, is, directly, proportional, to, its, temperature, in, 1802, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, published, results, of, similar, though, more, extensive, experiments, gay, lussac, credited, charles, earlier, work, by, naming, the, law, in, his, honor, gay, lussac, himself, is, credited, with, the, law, describing, pressure, which, he, found, in, 1809, it, states, that, the, pressure, exerted, on, a, container, s, sides, by, an, ideal, gas, is, proportional, to, its, temperature, in, 1811, amedeo, avogadro, verified, that, equal, volumes, of, pure, gases, contain, the, same, number, of, particles, his, theory, was, not, generally, accepted, until, 1858, when, another, italian, chemist, stanislao, cannizzaro, was, able, to, explain, non, ideal, exceptions, for, his, work, with, gases, a, century, prior, the, physical, constant, that, bears, his, name, the, avogadro, constant, is, the, number, of, atoms, per, mole, of, elemental, carbon, 12, 6, 022, 10, 23, mol, 1, this, specific, number, of, gas, particles, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, ideal, gas, law, occupies, 22, 40, liters, which, is, referred, to, as, the, molar, volume, avogadro, s, law, states, that, the, volume, occupied, by, an, ideal, gas, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, substance, in, the, volume, this, gives, rise, to, the, molar, volume, of, a, gas, which, at, stp, is, 22, 4, dm, 3, mol, liters, per, mole, the, relation, is, given, by, v, 1, n, 1, v, 2, n, 2, displaystyle, frac, v, 1, n, 1, frac, v, 2, n, 2, where, n, is, the, amount, of, substance, of, gas, the, number, of, molecules, divided, by, the, avogadro, constant, in, 1801, john, dalton, published, the, law, of, partial, pressures, from, his, work, with, ideal, gas, law, relationship, the, pressure, of, a, mixture, of, non, reactive, gases, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, pressures, of, all, of, the, constituent, gases, alone, mathematically, this, can, be, represented, for, n, species, as, the, image, of, dalton, s, journal, depicts, symbology, he, used, as, shorthand, to, record, the, path, he, followed, among, his, key, journal, observations, upon, mixing, unreactive, elastic, fluids, gases, were, the, following, thermodynamicists, use, this, factor, z, to, alter, the, ideal, gas, equation, to, account, for, compressibility, effects, of, real, gases, this, factor, represents, the, ratio, of, actual, to, ideal, specific, volumes, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, fudge, factor, or, correction, to, expand, the, useful, range, of, the, ideal, gas, law, for, design, purposes, usually, this, z, value, is, very, close, to, unity, the, compressibility, factor, image, illustrates, how, z, varies, over, a, range, of, very, cold, temperatures, particles, will, in, effect, stick, to, the, surface, of, an, object, moving, through, it, this, layer, of, particles, is, called, the, boundary, layer, at, the, surface, of, the, object, it, is, essentially, static, due, to, the, friction, of, the, surface, the, object, with, its, boundary, layer, is, effectively, the, new, shape, of, the, object, that, the, rest, of, the, molecules, see, as, the, object, approaches, this, boundary, layer, can, separate, from, the, surface, essentially, creating, a, new, surface, and, completely, changing, the, flow, path, the, classical, example, of, this, is, a, stalling, airfoil, the, delta, wing, image, clearly, shows, the, boundary, layer, thickening, as, the, gas, flows, from, right, to, left, along, the, leading, edge, in, fluid, dynamics, turbulence, or, turbulent, flow, is, a, flow, regime, characterized, by, chaotic, stochastic, property, changes, this, includes, low, momentum, diffusion, high, momentum, convection, and, rapid, variation, of, pressure, and, velocity, in, space, and, time, the, satellite, view, of, weather, around, robinson, crusoe, islands, illustrates, one, example, viscosity, a, physical, property, is, a, measure, of, how, well, adjacent, molecules, stick, to, one, another, a, solid, can, withstand, a, shearing, force, due, to, the, strength, of, these, sticky, intermolecular, forces, a, fluid, will, continuously, deform, when, subjected, to, a, similar, load, while, a, gas, has, a, lower, value, of, viscosity, than, a, liquid, it, is, still, an, observable, property, if, gases, had, no, viscosity, then, they, would, not, stick, to, the, surface, of, a, wing, and, form, a, boundary, layer, a, study, of, the, delta, wing, in, the, schlieren, image, reveals, that, the, gas, particles, stick, to, one, another, see, boundary, layer, section, in, fluid, mechanics, the, reynolds, number, is, the, ratio, of, inertial, forces, v, s, which, dominate, a, turbulent, flow, to, viscous, forces, l, which, is, proportional, to, viscosity, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, dimensionless, numbers, in, fluid, dynamics, and, is, used, usually, along, with, other, dimensionless, numbers, to, provide, a, criterion, for, determining, dynamic, similitude, as, such, the, reynolds, number, provides, the, link, between, modeling, results, design, and, the, full, scale, actual, conditions, it, can, also, be, used, to, characterize, the, flow, as, the, total, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, approaches, infinity, the, system, will, be, found, in, the, macrostate, that, corresponds, to, the, highest, multiplicity, in, order, to, illustrate, this, principle, observe, the, skin, temperature, of, a, frozen, metal, bar, using, a, thermal, image, of, the, skin, temperature, note, the, temperature, distribution, on, the, surface, this, initial, observation, of, temperature, represents, a, microstate, at, some, future, time, a, second, observation, of, the, skin, temperature, produces, a, second, microstate, by, continuing, this, observation, process, it, is, possible, to, produce, a, series, of, microstates, that, illustrate, the, thermal, history, of, the, bar, s, surface, characterization, of, this, historical, series, of, microstates, is, possible, by, choosing, the, macrostate, that, successfully, classifies, them, all, into, a, single, grouping, when, energy, transfer, ceases, from, a, system, this, condition, is, referred, to, as, thermodynamic, equilibrium, usually, this, condition, implies, the, system, and, surroundings, are, at, the, same, temperature, so, that, heat, no, longer, transfers, between, them, it, also, implies, that, external, forces, are, balanced, volume, does, not, change, and, all, chemical, reactions, within, the, system, are, complete, the, timeline, varies, for, these, events, depending, on, the, system, in, question, a, container, of, ice, allowed, to, melt, at, room, temperature, takes, hours, while, in, semiconductors, the, heat, transfer, that, occurs, in, the, device, transition, from, an, on, to, off, state, could, be, on, the, order, of, a, few, nanoseconds
