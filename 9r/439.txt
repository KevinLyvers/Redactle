plutonium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, pu, and, atomic, number, 94, it, is, a, silvery, gray, actinide, metal, that, tarnishes, when, exposed, to, air, and, forms, a, dull, coating, when, oxidized, the, element, normally, exhibits, six, allotropes, and, four, oxidation, states, it, reacts, with, carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon, and, hydrogen, when, exposed, to, moist, air, it, forms, oxides, and, hydrides, that, can, expand, the, sample, up, to, 70, in, volume, which, in, turn, flake, off, as, a, powder, that, is, pyrophoric, it, is, radioactive, and, can, accumulate, in, bones, which, makes, the, handling, of, plutonium, dangerous, plutonium, was, first, synthesized, and, isolated, in, late, 1940, and, early, 1941, by, deuteron, bombardment, of, uranium, 238, in, the, 1, 5, metre, 60, in, cyclotron, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, first, neptunium, 238, half, life, 2, 1, days, was, synthesized, which, then, beta, decayed, to, form, the, new, element, with, atomic, number, 94, and, atomic, weight, 238, half, life, 88, years, since, uranium, had, been, named, after, the, planet, uranus, and, neptunium, after, the, planet, neptune, element, 94, was, named, after, pluto, which, at, the, time, was, also, considered, a, planet, wartime, secrecy, prevented, the, university, of, california, team, from, publishing, its, discovery, until, 1948, plutonium, is, the, element, with, the, highest, atomic, number, known, to, occur, in, nature, trace, quantities, arise, in, natural, uranium, deposits, when, uranium, 238, captures, neutrons, emitted, by, decay, of, other, uranium, 238, atoms, the, heavy, isotope, plutonium, 244, has, a, half, life, long, enough, that, extreme, trace, quantities, should, have, survived, primordially, from, the, earth, s, formation, to, the, present, but, so, far, experiments, have, not, yet, been, sensitive, enough, to, detect, it, both, plutonium, 239, and, plutonium, 241, are, fissile, meaning, they, can, sustain, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, leading, to, applications, in, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, reactors, plutonium, 240, has, a, high, rate, of, spontaneous, fission, raising, the, neutron, flux, of, any, sample, containing, it, the, presence, of, plutonium, 240, limits, a, plutonium, sample, s, usability, for, weapons, or, its, quality, as, reactor, fuel, and, the, percentage, of, plutonium, 240, determines, its, grade, weapons, grade, fuel, grade, or, reactor, grade, plutonium, 238, has, a, half, life, of, 87, 7, years, and, emits, alpha, particles, it, is, a, heat, source, in, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, which, are, used, to, power, some, spacecraft, plutonium, isotopes, are, expensive, and, inconvenient, to, separate, so, particular, isotopes, are, usually, manufactured, in, specialized, reactors, producing, plutonium, in, useful, quantities, for, the, first, time, was, a, major, part, of, the, manhattan, project, during, world, war, ii, that, developed, the, first, atomic, bombs, the, fat, man, bombs, used, in, the, trinity, nuclear, test, in, july, 1945, and, in, the, bombing, of, nagasaki, in, august, 1945, had, plutonium, cores, human, radiation, experiments, studying, plutonium, were, conducted, without, informed, consent, and, several, criticality, accidents, some, lethal, occurred, after, the, war, disposal, of, plutonium, waste, from, nuclear, power, plants, and, dismantled, nuclear, weapons, built, during, the, cold, war, is, a, nuclear, proliferation, and, environmental, concern, other, sources, of, plutonium, in, the, environment, are, fallout, from, many, above, ground, nuclear, tests, which, are, now, banned, plutonium, like, most, metals, has, a, bright, silvery, appearance, at, first, much, like, nickel, but, it, oxidizes, very, quickly, to, a, dull, gray, though, yellow, and, olive, green, are, also, reported, at, room, temperature, plutonium, is, in, its, alpha, form, this, the, most, common, structural, form, of, the, element, allotrope, is, about, as, hard, and, brittle, as, gray, cast, iron, unless, it, is, alloyed, with, other, metals, to, make, it, soft, and, ductile, unlike, most, metals, it, is, not, a, good, conductor, of, heat, or, electricity, it, has, a, low, melting, point, 640, c, 1, 184, f, and, an, unusually, high, boiling, point, 3, 228, c, 5, 842, f, this, gives, a, large, range, of, temperatures, over, 2, 500, kelvin, wide, at, which, plutonium, is, liquid, but, this, range, is, neither, the, greatest, among, all, actinides, nor, among, all, metals, with, neptunium, theorized, to, have, the, greatest, range, in, both, instances, the, low, melting, point, as, well, as, the, reactivity, of, the, native, metal, compared, to, the, oxide, leads, to, plutonium, oxides, being, a, preferred, form, for, applications, such, as, nuclear, fission, reactor, fuel, mox, fuel, alpha, decay, the, release, of, a, high, energy, helium, nucleus, is, the, most, common, form, of, radioactive, decay, for, plutonium, a, 5, kg, mass, of, 239, pu, contains, about, 12, 5, 10, 24, atoms, with, a, half, life, of, 24, 100, years, about, 11, 5, 10, 12, of, its, atoms, decay, each, second, by, emitting, a, 5, 157, mev, alpha, particle, this, amounts, to, 9, 68, watts, of, power, heat, produced, by, the, deceleration, of, these, alpha, particles, makes, it, warm, to, the, touch, 238, pu, due, to, its, much, shorter, half, life, heats, up, to, much, higher, temperatures, and, glows, red, hot, with, blackbody, radiation, if, left, without, external, heating, or, cooling, this, heat, has, been, used, in, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, see, below, the, resistivity, of, plutonium, at, room, temperature, is, very, high, for, a, metal, and, it, gets, even, higher, with, lower, temperatures, which, is, unusual, for, metals, this, trend, continues, down, to, 100, k, below, which, resistivity, rapidly, decreases, for, fresh, samples, resistivity, then, begins, to, increase, with, time, at, around, 20, k, due, to, radiation, damage, with, the, rate, dictated, by, the, isotopic, composition, of, the, sample, because, of, self, irradiation, a, sample, of, plutonium, fatigues, throughout, its, crystal, structure, meaning, the, ordered, arrangement, of, its, atoms, becomes, disrupted, by, radiation, with, time, self, irradiation, can, also, lead, to, annealing, which, counteracts, some, of, the, fatigue, effects, as, temperature, increases, above, 100, k, unlike, most, materials, plutonium, increases, in, density, when, it, melts, by, 2, 5, but, the, liquid, metal, exhibits, a, linear, decrease, in, density, with, temperature, near, the, melting, point, the, liquid, plutonium, has, very, high, viscosity, and, surface, tension, compared, to, other, metals, plutonium, normally, has, six, allotropes, and, forms, a, seventh, zeta, at, high, temperature, within, a, limited, pressure, range, these, allotropes, which, are, different, structural, modifications, or, forms, of, an, element, have, very, similar, internal, energies, but, significantly, varying, densities, and, crystal, structures, this, makes, plutonium, very, sensitive, to, changes, in, temperature, pressure, or, chemistry, and, allows, for, dramatic, volume, changes, following, phase, transitions, from, one, allotropic, form, to, another, the, densities, of, the, different, allotropes, vary, from, 16, 00, g, cm, 3, to, 19, 86, g, cm, 3, the, presence, of, these, many, allotropes, makes, machining, plutonium, very, difficult, as, it, changes, state, very, readily, for, example, the, form, exists, at, room, temperature, in, unalloyed, plutonium, it, has, machining, characteristics, similar, to, cast, iron, but, changes, to, the, plastic, and, malleable, beta, form, at, slightly, higher, temperatures, the, reasons, for, the, complicated, phase, diagram, are, not, entirely, understood, the, form, has, a, low, symmetry, monoclinic, structure, hence, its, brittleness, strength, compressibility, and, poor, thermal, conductivity, plutonium, in, the, delta, form, normally, exists, in, the, 310, c, to, 452, c, range, but, is, stable, at, room, temperature, when, alloyed, with, a, small, percentage, of, gallium, aluminium, or, cerium, enhancing, workability, and, allowing, it, to, be, welded, the, form, has, more, typical, metallic, character, and, is, roughly, as, strong, and, malleable, as, aluminium, in, fission, weapons, the, explosive, shock, waves, used, to, compress, a, plutonium, core, will, also, cause, a, transition, from, the, usual, phase, plutonium, to, the, denser, form, significantly, helping, to, achieve, supercriticality, the, phase, the, highest, temperature, solid, allotrope, exhibits, anomalously, high, atomic, self, diffusion, compared, to, other, elements, plutonium, is, a, radioactive, actinide, metal, whose, isotope, plutonium, 239, is, one, of, the, three, primary, fissile, isotopes, uranium, 233, and, uranium, 235, are, the, other, two, plutonium, 241, is, also, highly, fissile, to, be, considered, fissile, an, isotope, s, atomic, nucleus, must, be, able, to, break, apart, or, fission, when, struck, by, a, slow, moving, neutron, and, to, release, enough, additional, neutrons, to, sustain, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, by, splitting, further, nuclei, pure, plutonium, 239, may, have, a, multiplication, factor, k, eff, larger, than, one, which, means, that, if, the, metal, is, present, in, sufficient, quantity, and, with, an, appropriate, geometry, e, g, a, sphere, of, sufficient, size, it, can, form, a, critical, mass, during, fission, a, fraction, of, the, nuclear, binding, energy, which, holds, a, nucleus, together, is, released, as, a, large, amount, of, electromagnetic, and, kinetic, energy, much, of, the, latter, being, quickly, converted, to, thermal, energy, fission, of, a, kilogram, of, plutonium, 239, can, produce, an, explosion, equivalent, to, 21, 000, tons, of, tnt, 88, 000, gj, it, is, this, energy, that, makes, plutonium, 239, useful, in, nuclear, weapons, and, reactors, the, presence, of, the, isotope, plutonium, 240, in, a, sample, limits, its, nuclear, bomb, potential, as, 240, pu, has, a, relatively, high, spontaneous, fission, rate, 440, fissions, per, second, per, gram, over, 1, 000, neutrons, per, second, per, gram, raising, the, background, neutron, levels, and, thus, increasing, the, risk, of, predetonation, plutonium, is, identified, as, either, weapons, grade, fuel, grade, or, reactor, grade, based, on, the, percentage, of, 240, pu, that, it, contains, weapons, grade, plutonium, contains, less, than, 7, 240, pu, fuel, grade, plutonium, contains, 7, 19, and, power, reactor, grade, contains, 19, or, more, 240, pu, supergrade, plutonium, with, less, than, 4, of, 240, pu, is, used, in, u, s, navy, weapons, stored, near, ship, and, submarine, crews, due, to, its, lower, radioactivity, plutonium, 238, is, not, fissile, but, can, undergo, nuclear, fission, easily, with, fast, neutrons, as, well, as, alpha, decay, all, plutonium, isotopes, can, be, bred, into, fissile, material, with, one, or, more, neutron, absorptions, whether, followed, by, beta, decay, or, not, this, makes, non, fissile, isotopes, of, plutonium, a, fertile, material, twenty, radioisotopes, of, plutonium, have, been, characterized, the, longest, lived, are, 244, pu, with, a, half, life, of, 80, 8, million, years, 242, pu, with, a, half, life, of, 373, 300, years, and, 239, pu, with, a, half, life, of, 24, 110, years, all, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, 7, 000, years, this, element, also, has, eight, metastable, states, though, all, have, half, lives, less, than, a, second, 244, pu, has, been, found, in, interstellar, space, and, it, has, the, longest, half, life, of, any, non, primordial, radioisotope, the, known, isotopes, of, plutonium, range, in, mass, number, from, 228, to, 247, the, main, decay, modes, of, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, lower, than, the, most, stable, isotope, 244, pu, are, spontaneous, fission, and, alpha, emission, mostly, forming, uranium, 92, protons, and, neptunium, 93, protons, isotopes, as, decay, products, neglecting, the, wide, range, of, daughter, nuclei, created, by, fission, processes, the, main, decay, mode, for, isotopes, heavier, than, 244, pu, along, with, 241, pu, and, 243, pu, is, beta, emission, forming, americium, isotopes, 95, protons, plutonium, 241, is, the, parent, isotope, of, the, neptunium, series, decaying, to, americium, 241, via, beta, emission, plutonium, 238, and, 239, are, the, most, widely, synthesized, isotopes, 239, pu, is, synthesized, via, the, following, reaction, using, uranium, u, and, neutrons, n, via, beta, decay, with, neptunium, np, as, an, intermediate, neutrons, from, the, fission, of, uranium, 235, are, captured, by, uranium, 238, nuclei, to, form, uranium, 239, a, beta, decay, converts, a, neutron, into, a, proton, to, form, neptunium, 239, half, life, 2, 36, days, and, another, beta, decay, forms, plutonium, 239, egon, bretscher, working, on, the, british, tube, alloys, project, predicted, this, reaction, theoretically, in, 1940, plutonium, 238, is, synthesized, by, bombarding, uranium, 238, with, deuterons, d, or, 2, h, the, nuclei, of, heavy, hydrogen, in, the, following, reaction, where, a, deuteron, hitting, uranium, 238, produces, two, neutrons, and, neptunium, 238, which, decays, by, emitting, negative, beta, particles, to, form, plutonium, 238, plutonium, 238, can, also, be, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, of, neptunium, 237, plutonium, isotopes, undergo, radioactive, decay, which, produces, decay, heat, different, isotopes, produce, different, amounts, of, heat, per, mass, the, decay, heat, is, usually, listed, as, watt, kilogram, or, milliwatt, gram, in, larger, pieces, of, plutonium, e, g, a, weapon, pit, and, inadequate, heat, removal, the, resulting, self, heating, may, be, significant, at, room, temperature, pure, plutonium, is, silvery, in, color, but, gains, a, tarnish, when, oxidized, the, element, displays, four, common, ionic, oxidation, states, in, aqueous, solution, and, one, rare, one, the, color, shown, by, plutonium, solutions, depends, on, both, the, oxidation, state, and, the, nature, of, the, acid, anion, it, is, the, acid, anion, that, influences, the, degree, of, complexing, how, atoms, connect, to, a, central, atom, of, the, plutonium, species, additionally, the, formal, 2, oxidation, state, of, plutonium, is, known, in, the, complex, cp, c, 5, h, 3, sime, 3, 2, a, 8, oxidation, state, is, possible, as, well, in, the, volatile, tetroxide, puo, 4, though, it, readily, decomposes, via, a, reduction, mechanism, similar, to, feo, 4, puo, 4, can, be, stabilized, in, alkaline, solutions, and, chloroform, metallic, plutonium, is, produced, by, reacting, plutonium, tetrafluoride, with, barium, calcium, or, lithium, at, 1200, c, metallic, plutonium, is, attacked, by, acids, oxygen, and, steam, but, not, by, alkalis, and, dissolves, easily, in, concentrated, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, and, perchloric, acids, molten, metal, must, be, kept, in, a, vacuum, or, an, inert, atmosphere, to, avoid, reaction, with, air, at, 135, c, the, metal, will, ignite, in, air, and, will, explode, if, placed, in, carbon, tetrachloride, plutonium, is, a, reactive, metal, in, moist, air, or, moist, argon, the, metal, oxidizes, rapidly, producing, a, mixture, of, oxides, and, hydrides, if, the, metal, is, exposed, long, enough, to, a, limited, amount, of, water, vapor, a, powdery, surface, coating, of, puo, 2, is, formed, also, formed, is, plutonium, hydride, but, an, excess, of, water, vapor, forms, only, puo, 2, plutonium, shows, enormous, and, reversible, reaction, rates, with, pure, hydrogen, forming, plutonium, hydride, it, also, reacts, readily, with, oxygen, forming, puo, and, puo, 2, as, well, as, intermediate, oxides, plutonium, oxide, fills, 40, more, volume, than, plutonium, metal, the, metal, reacts, with, the, halogens, giving, rise, to, compounds, with, the, general, formula, pux, 3, where, x, can, be, f, cl, br, or, i, and, puf, 4, is, also, seen, the, following, oxyhalides, are, observed, puocl, puobr, and, puoi, it, will, react, with, carbon, to, form, puc, nitrogen, to, form, pun, and, silicon, to, form, pusi, 2, the, organometallic, chemistry, of, plutonium, complexes, is, typical, for, organoactinide, species, a, characteristic, example, of, an, organoplutonium, compound, is, plutonocene, computational, chemistry, methods, indicate, an, enhanced, covalent, character, in, the, plutonium, ligand, bonding, powders, of, plutonium, its, hydrides, and, certain, oxides, like, pu, 2, o, 3, are, pyrophoric, meaning, they, can, ignite, spontaneously, at, ambient, temperature, and, are, therefore, handled, in, an, inert, dry, atmosphere, of, nitrogen, or, argon, bulk, plutonium, ignites, only, when, heated, above, 400, c, pu, 2, o, 3, spontaneously, heats, up, and, transforms, into, puo, 2, which, is, stable, in, dry, air, but, reacts, with, water, vapor, when, heated, crucibles, used, to, contain, plutonium, need, to, be, able, to, withstand, its, strongly, reducing, properties, refractory, metals, such, as, tantalum, and, tungsten, along, with, the, more, stable, oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides, and, silicides, can, tolerate, this, melting, in, an, electric, arc, furnace, can, be, used, to, produce, small, ingots, of, the, metal, without, the, need, for, a, crucible, cerium, is, used, as, a, chemical, simulant, of, plutonium, for, development, of, containment, extraction, and, other, technologies, plutonium, is, an, element, in, which, the, 5f, electrons, are, the, transition, border, between, delocalized, and, localized, it, is, therefore, considered, one, of, the, most, complex, elements, the, anomalous, behavior, of, plutonium, is, caused, by, its, electronic, structure, the, energy, difference, between, the, 6d, and, 5f, subshells, is, very, low, the, size, of, the, 5f, shell, is, just, enough, to, allow, the, electrons, to, form, bonds, within, the, lattice, on, the, very, boundary, between, localized, and, bonding, behavior, the, proximity, of, energy, levels, leads, to, multiple, low, energy, electron, configurations, with, near, equal, energy, levels, this, leads, to, competing, 5f, n, 7s, 2, and, 5f, n, 1, 6d, 1, 7s, 2, configurations, which, causes, the, complexity, of, its, chemical, behavior, the, highly, directional, nature, of, 5f, orbitals, is, responsible, for, directional, covalent, bonds, in, molecules, and, complexes, of, plutonium, plutonium, can, form, alloys, and, intermediate, compounds, with, most, other, metals, exceptions, include, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, of, the, alkali, metals, and, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and, barium, of, the, alkaline, earth, metals, and, europium, and, ytterbium, of, the, rare, earth, metals, partial, exceptions, include, the, refractory, metals, chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and, tungsten, which, are, soluble, in, liquid, plutonium, but, insoluble, or, only, slightly, soluble, in, solid, plutonium, gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium, and, cerium, can, stabilize, phase, plutonium, for, room, temperature, silicon, indium, zinc, and, zirconium, allow, formation, of, metastable, state, when, rapidly, cooled, high, amounts, of, hafnium, holmium, and, thallium, also, allows, some, retention, of, the, phase, at, room, temperature, neptunium, is, the, only, element, that, can, stabilize, the, phase, at, higher, temperatures, plutonium, alloys, can, be, produced, by, adding, a, metal, to, molten, plutonium, if, the, alloying, metal, is, reductive, enough, plutonium, can, be, added, in, the, form, of, oxides, or, halides, the, phase, plutonium, gallium, alloy, pga, and, plutonium, aluminium, alloy, are, produced, by, adding, pu, iii, fluoride, to, molten, gallium, or, aluminium, which, has, the, advantage, of, avoiding, dealing, directly, with, the, highly, reactive, plutonium, metal, trace, amounts, of, plutonium, 238, plutonium, 239, plutonium, 240, and, plutonium, 244, can, be, found, in, nature, small, traces, of, plutonium, 239, a, few, parts, per, trillion, and, its, decay, products, are, naturally, found, in, some, concentrated, ores, of, uranium, such, as, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, in, oklo, gabon, the, ratio, of, plutonium, 239, to, uranium, at, the, cigar, lake, mine, uranium, deposit, ranges, from, 2, 4, 10, 12, to, 44, 10, 12, these, trace, amounts, of, 239, pu, originate, in, the, following, fashion, on, rare, occasions, 238, u, undergoes, spontaneous, fission, and, in, the, process, the, nucleus, emits, one, or, two, free, neutrons, with, some, kinetic, energy, when, one, of, these, neutrons, strikes, the, nucleus, of, another, 238, u, atom, it, is, absorbed, by, the, atom, which, becomes, 239, u, with, a, relatively, short, half, life, 239, u, decays, to, 239, np, which, decays, into, 239, pu, finally, exceedingly, small, amounts, of, plutonium, 238, attributed, to, the, extremely, rare, double, beta, decay, of, uranium, 238, have, been, found, in, natural, uranium, samples, due, to, its, relatively, long, half, life, of, about, 80, million, years, it, was, suggested, that, plutonium, 244, occurs, naturally, as, a, primordial, nuclide, but, early, reports, of, its, detection, could, not, be, confirmed, based, on, its, likely, initial, abundance, in, the, solar, system, present, experiments, as, of, 2022, are, likely, about, an, order, of, magnitude, away, from, detecting, live, primordial, 244, pu, however, its, long, half, life, ensured, its, circulation, across, the, solar, system, before, its, extinction, and, indeed, evidence, of, the, spontaneous, fission, of, extinct, 244, pu, has, been, found, in, meteorites, the, former, presence, of, 244, pu, in, the, early, solar, system, has, been, confirmed, since, it, manifests, itself, today, as, an, excess, of, its, daughters, either, 232, th, from, the, alpha, decay, pathway, or, xenon, isotopes, from, its, spontaneous, fission, the, latter, are, generally, more, useful, because, the, chemistries, of, thorium, and, plutonium, are, rather, similar, both, are, predominantly, tetravalent, and, hence, an, excess, of, thorium, would, not, be, strong, evidence, that, some, of, it, was, formed, as, a, plutonium, daughter, 244, pu, has, the, longest, half, life, of, all, transuranic, nuclides, and, is, produced, only, in, the, r, process, in, supernovae, and, colliding, neutron, stars, when, nuclei, are, ejected, from, these, events, at, high, speed, to, reach, earth, 244, pu, alone, among, transuranic, nuclides, has, a, long, enough, half, life, to, survive, the, journey, and, hence, tiny, traces, of, live, interstellar, 244, pu, have, been, found, in, the, deep, sea, floor, because, 240, pu, also, occurs, in, the, decay, chain, of, 244, pu, it, must, thus, also, be, present, in, secular, equilibrium, albeit, in, even, tinier, quantities, minute, traces, of, plutonium, are, usually, found, in, the, human, body, due, to, the, 550, atmospheric, and, underwater, nuclear, tests, that, have, been, carried, out, and, to, a, small, number, of, major, nuclear, accidents, most, atmospheric, and, underwater, nuclear, testing, was, stopped, by, the, limited, test, ban, treaty, in, 1963, which, of, the, nuclear, powers, was, signed, and, ratified, by, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, soviet, union, france, would, continue, atmospheric, nuclear, testing, until, 1974, and, china, would, continue, atmospheric, nuclear, testing, until, 1980, all, subsequent, nuclear, testing, was, conducted, underground, enrico, fermi, and, a, team, of, scientists, at, the, university, of, rome, reported, that, they, had, discovered, element, 94, in, 1934, fermi, called, the, element, hesperium, and, mentioned, it, in, his, nobel, lecture, in, 1938, the, sample, actually, contained, products, of, nuclear, fission, primarily, barium, and, krypton, nuclear, fission, discovered, in, germany, in, 1938, by, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, was, unknown, at, the, time, plutonium, specifically, plutonium, 238, was, first, produced, isolated, and, then, chemically, identified, between, december, 1940, and, february, 1941, by, glenn, t, seaborg, edwin, mcmillan, emilio, segr, joseph, w, kennedy, and, arthur, wahl, by, deuteron, bombardment, of, uranium, in, the, 60, inch, 150, cm, cyclotron, at, the, berkeley, radiation, laboratory, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, neptunium, 238, was, created, directly, by, the, bombardment, but, decayed, by, beta, emission, with, a, half, life, of, a, little, over, two, days, which, indicated, the, formation, of, element, 94, the, first, bombardment, took, place, on, december, 14, 1940, and, the, new, element, was, first, identified, through, oxidation, on, the, night, of, february, 23, 24, 1941, a, paper, documenting, the, discovery, was, prepared, by, the, team, and, sent, to, the, journal, physical, review, in, march, 1941, but, publication, was, delayed, until, a, year, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, due, to, security, concerns, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, in, cambridge, egon, bretscher, and, norman, feather, realized, that, a, slow, neutron, reactor, fuelled, with, uranium, would, theoretically, produce, substantial, amounts, of, plutonium, 239, as, a, by, product, they, calculated, that, element, 94, would, be, fissile, and, had, the, added, advantage, of, being, chemically, different, from, uranium, and, could, easily, be, separated, from, it, mcmillan, had, recently, named, the, first, transuranic, element, neptunium, after, the, planet, neptune, and, suggested, that, element, 94, being, the, next, element, in, the, series, be, named, for, what, was, then, considered, the, next, planet, pluto, nicholas, kemmer, of, the, cambridge, team, independently, proposed, the, same, name, based, on, the, same, reasoning, as, the, berkeley, team, seaborg, originally, considered, the, name, plutium, but, later, thought, that, it, did, not, sound, as, good, as, plutonium, he, chose, the, letters, pu, as, a, joke, in, reference, to, the, interjection, p, u, to, indicate, an, especially, disgusting, smell, which, passed, without, notice, into, the, periodic, table, alternative, names, considered, by, seaborg, and, others, were, ultimium, or, extremium, because, of, the, erroneous, belief, that, they, had, found, the, last, possible, element, on, the, periodic, table, hahn, and, strassmann, and, independently, kurt, starke, were, at, this, point, also, working, on, transuranic, elements, in, berlin, it, is, likely, that, hahn, and, strassmann, were, aware, that, plutonium, 239, should, be, fissile, however, they, did, not, have, a, strong, neutron, source, element, 93, was, reported, by, hahn, and, strassmann, as, well, as, starke, in, 1942, hahn, s, group, did, not, pursue, element, 94, likely, because, they, were, discouraged, by, mcmillan, and, abelson, s, lack, of, success, in, isolating, it, when, they, had, first, found, element, 93, however, since, hahn, s, group, had, access, to, the, stronger, cyclotron, at, paris, at, this, point, they, would, likely, have, been, able, to, detect, plutonium, had, they, tried, albeit, in, tiny, quantities, a, few, becquerels, the, chemistry, of, plutonium, was, found, to, resemble, uranium, after, a, few, months, of, initial, study, early, research, was, continued, at, the, secret, metallurgical, laboratory, of, the, university, of, chicago, on, august, 20, 1942, a, trace, quantity, of, this, element, was, isolated, and, measured, for, the, first, time, about, 50, micrograms, of, plutonium, 239, combined, with, uranium, and, fission, products, was, produced, and, only, about, 1, microgram, was, isolated, this, procedure, enabled, chemists, to, determine, the, new, element, s, atomic, weight, on, december, 2, 1942, on, a, racket, court, under, the, west, grandstand, at, the, university, of, chicago, s, stagg, field, researchers, headed, by, enrico, fermi, achieved, the, first, self, sustaining, chain, reaction, in, a, graphite, and, uranium, pile, known, as, cp, 1, using, theoretical, information, garnered, from, the, operation, of, cp, 1, dupont, constructed, an, air, cooled, experimental, production, reactor, known, as, x, 10, and, a, pilot, chemical, separation, facility, at, oak, ridge, the, separation, facility, using, methods, developed, by, glenn, t, seaborg, and, a, team, of, researchers, at, the, met, lab, removed, plutonium, from, uranium, irradiated, in, the, x, 10, reactor, information, from, cp, 1, was, also, useful, to, met, lab, scientists, designing, the, water, cooled, plutonium, production, reactors, for, hanford, construction, at, the, site, began, in, mid, 1943, in, november, 1943, some, plutonium, trifluoride, was, reduced, to, create, the, first, sample, of, plutonium, metal, a, few, micrograms, of, metallic, beads, enough, plutonium, was, produced, to, make, it, the, first, synthetically, made, element, to, be, visible, with, the, unaided, eye, the, nuclear, properties, of, plutonium, 239, were, also, studied, researchers, found, that, when, it, is, hit, by, a, neutron, it, breaks, apart, fissions, by, releasing, more, neutrons, and, energy, these, neutrons, can, hit, other, atoms, of, plutonium, 239, and, so, on, in, an, exponentially, fast, chain, reaction, this, can, result, in, an, explosion, large, enough, to, destroy, a, city, if, enough, of, the, isotope, is, concentrated, to, form, a, critical, mass, during, the, early, stages, of, research, animals, were, used, to, study, the, effects, of, radioactive, substances, on, health, these, studies, began, in, 1944, at, the, university, of, california, at, berkeley, s, radiation, laboratory, and, were, conducted, by, joseph, g, hamilton, hamilton, was, looking, to, answer, questions, about, how, plutonium, would, vary, in, the, body, depending, on, exposure, mode, oral, ingestion, inhalation, absorption, through, skin, retention, rates, and, how, plutonium, would, be, fixed, in, tissues, and, distributed, among, the, various, organs, hamilton, started, administering, soluble, microgram, portions, of, plutonium, 239, compounds, to, rats, using, different, valence, states, and, different, methods, of, introducing, the, plutonium, oral, intravenous, etc, eventually, the, lab, at, chicago, also, conducted, its, own, plutonium, injection, experiments, using, different, animals, such, as, mice, rabbits, fish, and, even, dogs, the, results, of, the, studies, at, berkeley, and, chicago, showed, that, plutonium, s, physiological, behavior, differed, significantly, from, that, of, radium, the, most, alarming, result, was, that, there, was, significant, deposition, of, plutonium, in, the, liver, and, in, the, actively, metabolizing, portion, of, bone, furthermore, the, rate, of, plutonium, elimination, in, the, excreta, differed, between, species, of, animals, by, as, much, as, a, factor, of, five, such, variation, made, it, extremely, difficult, to, estimate, what, the, rate, would, be, for, human, beings, during, world, war, ii, the, u, s, government, established, the, manhattan, project, for, developing, an, atomic, bomb, the, three, primary, research, and, production, sites, of, the, project, were, the, plutonium, production, facility, at, what, is, now, the, hanford, site, the, uranium, enrichment, facilities, at, oak, ridge, tennessee, and, the, weapons, research, and, design, lab, now, known, as, los, alamos, national, laboratory, lanl, the, first, production, reactor, that, made, 239, pu, was, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, it, went, online, in, 1943, and, was, built, at, a, facility, in, oak, ridge, that, later, became, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, january, 1944, workers, laid, the, foundations, for, the, first, chemical, separation, building, t, plant, located, in, 200, west, both, the, t, plant, and, its, sister, facility, in, 200, west, the, u, plant, were, completed, by, october, u, plant, was, used, only, for, training, during, the, manhattan, project, the, separation, building, in, 200, east, b, plant, was, completed, in, february, 1945, the, second, facility, planned, for, 200, east, was, canceled, nicknamed, queen, marys, by, the, workers, who, built, them, the, separation, buildings, were, awesome, canyon, like, structures, 800, feet, long, 65, feet, wide, and, 80, feet, high, containing, forty, process, pools, the, interior, had, an, eerie, quality, as, operators, behind, seven, feet, of, concrete, shielding, manipulated, remote, control, equipment, by, looking, through, television, monitors, and, periscopes, from, an, upper, gallery, even, with, massive, concrete, lids, on, the, process, pools, precautions, against, radiation, exposure, were, necessary, and, influenced, all, aspects, of, plant, design, on, april, 5, 1944, emilio, segr, at, los, alamos, received, the, first, sample, of, reactor, produced, plutonium, from, oak, ridge, within, ten, days, he, discovered, that, reactor, bred, plutonium, had, a, higher, concentration, of, 240, pu, than, cyclotron, produced, plutonium, 240, pu, has, a, high, spontaneous, fission, rate, raising, the, overall, background, neutron, level, of, the, plutonium, sample, the, original, gun, type, plutonium, weapon, code, named, thin, man, had, to, be, abandoned, as, a, result, the, increased, number, of, spontaneous, neutrons, meant, that, nuclear, pre, detonation, fizzle, was, likely, the, entire, plutonium, weapon, design, effort, at, los, alamos, was, soon, changed, to, the, more, complicated, implosion, device, code, named, fat, man, in, an, implosion, bomb, plutonium, is, compressed, to, high, density, with, explosive, lenses, a, technically, more, daunting, task, than, the, simple, gun, type, bomb, but, necessary, for, a, plutonium, bomb, uranium, by, contrast, can, be, used, with, either, method, construction, of, the, hanford, b, reactor, the, first, industrial, sized, nuclear, reactor, for, the, purposes, of, material, production, was, completed, in, march, 1945, b, reactor, produced, the, fissile, material, for, the, plutonium, weapons, used, during, world, war, ii, b, d, and, f, were, the, initial, reactors, built, at, hanford, and, six, additional, plutonium, producing, reactors, were, built, later, at, the, site, by, the, end, of, january, 1945, the, highly, purified, plutonium, underwent, further, concentration, in, the, completed, chemical, isolation, building, where, remaining, impurities, were, removed, successfully, los, alamos, received, its, first, plutonium, from, hanford, on, february, 2, while, it, was, still, by, no, means, clear, that, enough, plutonium, could, be, produced, for, use, in, bombs, by, the, war, s, end, hanford, was, by, early, 1945, in, operation, only, two, years, had, passed, since, col, franklin, matthias, first, set, up, his, temporary, headquarters, on, the, banks, of, the, columbia, river, according, to, kate, brown, the, plutonium, production, plants, at, hanford, and, mayak, in, russia, over, a, period, of, four, decades, both, released, more, than, 200, million, curies, of, radioactive, isotopes, into, the, surrounding, environment, twice, the, amount, expelled, in, the, chernobyl, disaster, in, each, instance, most, of, this, radioactive, contamination, over, the, years, were, part, of, normal, operations, but, unforeseen, accidents, did, occur, and, plant, management, kept, this, secret, as, the, pollution, continued, unabated, in, 2004, a, safe, was, discovered, during, excavations, of, a, burial, trench, at, the, hanford, nuclear, site, inside, the, safe, were, various, items, including, a, large, glass, bottle, containing, a, whitish, slurry, which, was, subsequently, identified, as, the, oldest, sample, of, weapons, grade, plutonium, known, to, exist, isotope, analysis, by, pacific, northwest, national, laboratory, indicated, that, the, plutonium, in, the, bottle, was, manufactured, in, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, at, oak, ridge, during, 1944, the, first, atomic, bomb, test, codenamed, trinity, and, detonated, on, july, 16, 1945, near, alamogordo, new, mexico, used, plutonium, as, its, fissile, material, the, implosion, design, of, gadget, as, the, trinity, device, was, codenamed, used, conventional, explosive, lenses, to, compress, a, sphere, of, plutonium, into, a, supercritical, mass, which, was, simultaneously, showered, with, neutrons, from, urchin, an, initiator, made, of, polonium, and, beryllium, neutron, source, n, reaction, together, these, ensured, a, runaway, chain, reaction, and, explosion, the, weapon, weighed, over, 4, tonnes, though, it, had, just, 6, kg, of, plutonium, about, 20, of, the, plutonium, in, the, trinity, weapon, fissioned, releasing, an, energy, equivalent, to, about, 20, 000, tons, of, tnt, an, identical, design, was, used, in, fat, man, dropped, on, nagasaki, japan, on, august, 9, 1945, killing, 35, 000, 40, 000, people, and, destroying, 68, 80, of, war, production, at, nagasaki, only, after, the, announcement, of, the, first, atomic, bombs, was, the, existence, and, name, of, plutonium, made, known, to, the, public, by, the, manhattan, project, s, smyth, report, large, stockpiles, of, weapons, grade, plutonium, were, built, up, by, both, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, during, the, cold, war, the, u, s, reactors, at, hanford, and, the, savannah, river, site, in, south, carolina, produced, 103, tonnes, and, an, estimated, 170, tonnes, of, military, grade, plutonium, was, produced, in, the, ussr, each, year, about, 20, tonnes, of, the, element, is, still, produced, as, a, by, product, of, the, nuclear, power, industry, as, much, as, 1000, tonnes, of, plutonium, may, be, in, storage, with, more, than, 200, tonnes, of, that, either, inside, or, extracted, from, nuclear, weapons, sipri, estimated, the, world, plutonium, stockpile, in, 2007, as, about, 500, tonnes, divided, equally, between, weapon, and, civilian, stocks, radioactive, contamination, at, the, rocky, flats, plant, primarily, resulted, from, two, major, plutonium, fires, in, 1957, and, 1969, much, lower, concentrations, of, radioactive, isotopes, were, released, throughout, the, operational, life, of, the, plant, from, 1952, to, 1992, prevailing, winds, from, the, plant, carried, airborne, contamination, south, and, east, into, populated, areas, northwest, of, denver, the, contamination, of, the, denver, area, by, plutonium, from, the, fires, and, other, sources, was, not, publicly, reported, until, the, 1970s, according, to, a, 1972, study, coauthored, by, edward, martell, in, the, more, densely, populated, areas, of, denver, the, pu, contamination, level, in, surface, soils, is, several, times, fallout, and, the, plutonium, contamination, just, east, of, the, rocky, flats, plant, ranges, up, to, hundreds, of, times, that, from, nuclear, tests, as, noted, by, carl, johnson, in, ambio, exposures, of, a, large, population, in, the, denver, area, to, plutonium, and, other, radionuclides, in, the, exhaust, plumes, from, the, plant, date, back, to, 1953, weapons, production, at, the, rocky, flats, plant, was, halted, after, a, combined, fbi, and, epa, raid, in, 1989, and, years, of, protests, the, plant, has, since, been, shut, down, with, its, buildings, demolished, and, completely, removed, from, the, site, in, the, u, s, some, plutonium, extracted, from, dismantled, nuclear, weapons, is, melted, to, form, glass, logs, of, plutonium, oxide, that, weigh, two, tonnes, the, glass, is, made, of, borosilicates, mixed, with, cadmium, and, gadolinium, these, logs, are, planned, to, be, encased, in, stainless, steel, and, stored, as, much, as, 4, km, 2, mi, underground, in, bore, holes, that, will, be, back, filled, with, concrete, the, u, s, planned, to, store, plutonium, in, this, way, at, the, yucca, mountain, nuclear, waste, repository, which, is, about, 100, miles, 160, km, north, east, of, las, vegas, nevada, on, march, 5, 2009, energy, secretary, steven, chu, told, a, senate, hearing, the, yucca, mountain, site, no, longer, was, viewed, as, an, option, for, storing, reactor, waste, starting, in, 1999, military, generated, nuclear, waste, is, being, entombed, at, the, waste, isolation, pilot, plant, in, new, mexico, in, a, presidential, memorandum, dated, january, 29, 2010, president, obama, established, the, blue, ribbon, commission, on, america, s, nuclear, future, in, their, final, report, the, commission, put, forth, recommendations, for, developing, a, comprehensive, strategy, to, pursue, including, during, and, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, scientists, working, on, the, manhattan, project, and, other, nuclear, weapons, research, projects, conducted, studies, of, the, effects, of, plutonium, on, laboratory, animals, and, human, subjects, animal, studies, found, that, a, few, milligrams, of, plutonium, per, kg, of, tissue, is, a, lethal, dose, for, human, subjects, this, involved, injecting, solutions, typically, containing, 5, micrograms, g, of, plutonium, into, hospital, patients, thought, to, be, either, terminally, ill, or, to, have, a, life, expectancy, of, less, than, ten, years, either, due, to, age, or, chronic, disease, this, was, reduced, to, 1, g, in, july, 1945, after, animal, studies, found, that, the, way, plutonium, distributes, itself, in, bones, is, more, dangerous, than, radium, most, of, the, subjects, eileen, welsome, says, were, poor, powerless, and, sick, in, 1945, 47, eighteen, human, test, subjects, were, injected, with, plutonium, without, informed, consent, the, tests, were, used, to, create, diagnostic, tools, to, determine, the, uptake, of, plutonium, in, the, body, in, order, to, develop, safety, standards, for, working, with, plutonium, ebb, cade, was, an, unwilling, participant, in, medical, experiments, that, involved, injection, of, 4, 7, g, of, plutonium, on, 10, april, 1945, at, oak, ridge, tennessee, this, experiment, was, under, the, supervision, of, harold, hodge, other, experiments, directed, by, the, united, states, atomic, energy, commission, and, the, manhattan, project, continued, into, the, 1970s, the, plutonium, files, chronicles, the, lives, of, the, subjects, of, the, secret, program, by, naming, each, person, involved, and, discussing, the, ethical, and, medical, research, conducted, in, secret, by, the, scientists, and, doctors, the, episode, is, now, considered, to, be, a, serious, breach, of, medical, ethics, and, of, the, hippocratic, oath, the, government, covered, up, most, of, these, actions, until, 1993, when, president, bill, clinton, ordered, a, change, of, policy, and, federal, agencies, then, made, available, relevant, records, the, resulting, investigation, was, undertaken, by, the, president, s, advisory, committee, on, human, radiation, experiments, and, it, uncovered, much, of, the, material, about, plutonium, research, on, humans, the, committee, issued, a, controversial, 1995, report, which, said, that, wrongs, were, committed, but, it, did, not, condemn, those, who, perpetrated, them, 239, pu, is, a, key, fissile, component, in, nuclear, weapons, due, to, its, ease, of, fission, and, availability, encasing, the, bomb, s, plutonium, pit, in, a, tamper, a, layer, of, dense, material, decreases, the, critical, mass, by, reflecting, escaping, neutrons, back, into, the, plutonium, core, this, reduces, the, critical, mass, from, 16, kg, to, 10, kg, which, is, a, sphere, with, a, diameter, of, about, 10, centimeters, 4, in, this, critical, mass, is, about, a, third, of, that, for, uranium, 235, the, fat, man, plutonium, bombs, used, explosive, compression, of, plutonium, to, obtain, significantly, higher, density, than, normal, combined, with, a, central, neutron, source, to, begin, the, reaction, and, increase, efficiency, thus, only, 6, kg, of, plutonium, was, needed, for, an, explosive, yield, equivalent, to, 20, kilotons, of, tnt, hypothetically, as, little, as, 4, kg, of, plutonium, and, maybe, even, less, could, be, used, to, make, a, single, atomic, bomb, using, very, sophisticated, assembly, designs, spent, nuclear, fuel, from, normal, light, water, reactors, contains, plutonium, but, it, is, a, mixture, of, plutonium, 242, 240, 239, and, 238, the, mixture, is, not, sufficiently, enriched, for, efficient, nuclear, weapons, but, can, be, used, once, as, mox, fuel, accidental, neutron, capture, causes, the, amount, of, plutonium, 242, and, 240, to, grow, each, time, the, plutonium, is, irradiated, in, a, reactor, with, low, speed, thermal, neutrons, so, that, after, the, second, cycle, the, plutonium, can, only, be, consumed, by, fast, neutron, reactors, if, fast, neutron, reactors, are, not, available, the, normal, case, excess, plutonium, is, usually, discarded, and, forms, one, of, the, longest, lived, components, of, nuclear, waste, the, desire, to, consume, this, plutonium, and, other, transuranic, fuels, and, reduce, the, radiotoxicity, of, the, waste, is, the, usual, reason, nuclear, engineers, give, to, make, fast, neutron, reactors, the, most, common, chemical, process, purex, p, lutonium, ur, anium, ex, traction, reprocesses, spent, nuclear, fuel, to, extract, plutonium, and, uranium, which, can, be, used, to, form, a, mixed, oxide, mox, fuel, for, reuse, in, nuclear, reactors, weapons, grade, plutonium, can, be, added, to, the, fuel, mix, mox, fuel, is, used, in, light, water, reactors, and, consists, of, 60, kg, of, plutonium, per, tonne, of, fuel, after, four, years, three, quarters, of, the, plutonium, is, burned, turned, into, other, elements, mox, fuel, has, been, in, use, since, the, 1980s, and, is, widely, used, in, europe, breeder, reactors, are, specifically, designed, to, create, more, fissionable, material, than, they, consume, mox, fuel, improves, total, burnup, a, fuel, rod, is, reprocessed, after, three, years, of, use, to, remove, waste, products, which, by, then, account, for, 3, of, the, total, weight, of, the, rods, any, uranium, or, plutonium, isotopes, produced, during, those, three, years, are, left, and, the, rod, goes, back, into, production, the, presence, of, up, to, 1, gallium, per, mass, in, weapons, grade, plutonium, alloy, has, the, potential, to, interfere, with, long, term, operation, of, a, light, water, reactor, plutonium, recovered, from, spent, reactor, fuel, poses, little, proliferation, hazard, because, of, excessive, contamination, with, non, fissile, plutonium, 240, and, plutonium, 242, separation, of, the, isotopes, is, not, feasible, a, dedicated, reactor, operating, on, very, low, burnup, hence, minimal, exposure, of, newly, formed, plutonium, 239, to, additional, neutrons, which, causes, it, to, be, transformed, to, heavier, isotopes, of, plutonium, is, generally, required, to, produce, material, suitable, for, use, in, efficient, nuclear, weapons, while, weapons, grade, plutonium, is, defined, to, contain, at, least, 92, plutonium, 239, of, the, total, plutonium, the, united, states, have, managed, to, detonate, an, under, 20kt, device, using, plutonium, believed, to, contain, only, about, 85, plutonium, 239, so, called, fuel, grade, plutonium, the, reactor, grade, plutonium, produced, by, a, regular, lwr, burnup, cycle, typically, contains, less, than, 60, pu, 239, with, up, to, 30, parasitic, pu, 240, pu, 242, and, 10, 15, fissile, pu, 241, it, is, unknown, if, a, device, using, plutonium, obtained, from, reprocessed, civil, nuclear, waste, can, be, detonated, however, such, a, device, could, hypothetically, fizzle, and, spread, radioactive, materials, over, a, large, urban, area, the, iaea, conservatively, classifies, plutonium, of, all, isotopic, vectors, as, direct, use, material, that, is, nuclear, material, that, can, be, used, for, the, manufacture, of, nuclear, explosives, components, without, transmutation, or, further, enrichment, plutonium, 238, has, a, half, life, of, 87, 74, years, it, emits, a, large, amount, of, thermal, energy, with, low, levels, of, both, gamma, rays, photons, and, neutrons, being, an, alpha, emitter, it, combines, high, energy, radiation, with, low, penetration, and, thereby, requires, minimal, shielding, a, sheet, of, paper, can, be, used, to, shield, against, the, alpha, particles, from, 238, pu, one, kilogram, of, the, isotope, generates, about, 570, watts, of, heat, these, characteristics, make, it, well, suited, for, electrical, power, generation, for, devices, that, must, function, without, direct, maintenance, for, timescales, approximating, a, human, lifetime, it, is, therefore, used, in, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, and, radioisotope, heater, units, such, as, those, in, the, cassini, voyager, galileo, and, new, horizons, space, probes, and, the, curiosity, and, perseverance, mars, 2020, mars, rovers, the, twin, voyager, spacecraft, were, launched, in, 1977, each, containing, a, 500, watt, plutonium, power, source, over, 30, years, later, each, source, still, produces, about, 300, watts, which, allows, limited, operation, of, each, spacecraft, an, earlier, version, of, the, same, technology, powered, five, apollo, lunar, surface, experiment, packages, starting, with, apollo, 12, in, 1969, 238, pu, has, also, been, used, successfully, to, power, artificial, heart, pacemakers, to, reduce, the, risk, of, repeated, surgery, it, has, been, largely, replaced, by, lithium, based, primary, cells, but, as, of, 2003, there, were, somewhere, between, 50, and, 100, plutonium, powered, pacemakers, still, implanted, and, functioning, in, living, patients, in, the, united, states, by, the, end, of, 2007, the, number, of, plutonium, powered, pacemakers, was, reported, to, be, down, to, just, nine, 238, pu, was, studied, as, a, way, to, provide, supplemental, heat, to, scuba, diving, 238, pu, mixed, with, beryllium, is, used, to, generate, neutrons, for, research, purposes, there, are, two, aspects, to, the, harmful, effects, of, plutonium, radioactivity, and, heavy, metal, poisoning, plutonium, compounds, are, radioactive, and, accumulate, in, bone, marrow, contamination, by, plutonium, oxide, has, resulted, from, nuclear, disasters, and, radioactive, incidents, including, military, nuclear, accidents, where, nuclear, weapons, have, burned, studies, of, the, effects, of, these, smaller, releases, as, well, as, of, the, widespread, radiation, poisoning, sickness, and, death, following, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, have, provided, considerable, information, regarding, the, dangers, symptoms, and, prognosis, of, radiation, poisoning, which, in, the, case, of, the, japanese, survivors, was, largely, unrelated, to, direct, plutonium, exposure, the, decay, of, plutonium, releases, three, types, of, ionizing, radiation, alpha, beta, and, gamma, either, acute, or, longer, term, exposure, carries, a, danger, of, serious, health, outcomes, including, radiation, sickness, genetic, damage, cancer, and, death, the, danger, increases, with, the, amount, of, exposure, radiation, can, travel, only, a, short, distance, and, cannot, travel, through, the, outer, dead, layer, of, human, skin, radiation, can, penetrate, human, skin, but, cannot, go, all, the, way, through, the, body, radiation, can, go, all, the, way, through, the, body, even, though, radiation, cannot, penetrate, the, skin, ingested, or, inhaled, plutonium, does, irradiate, internal, organs, particles, generated, by, inhaled, plutonium, have, been, found, to, cause, lung, cancer, in, a, cohort, of, european, nuclear, workers, the, skeleton, where, plutonium, accumulates, and, the, liver, where, it, collects, and, becomes, concentrated, are, at, risk, plutonium, is, not, absorbed, into, the, body, efficiently, when, ingested, only, 0, 04, of, plutonium, oxide, is, absorbed, after, ingestion, plutonium, absorbed, by, the, body, is, excreted, very, slowly, with, a, biological, half, life, of, 200, years, plutonium, passes, only, slowly, through, cell, membranes, and, intestinal, boundaries, so, absorption, by, ingestion, and, incorporation, into, bone, structure, proceeds, very, slowly, donald, mastick, accidentally, swallowed, a, small, amount, of, plutonium, iii, chloride, which, was, detectable, for, the, next, thirty, years, of, his, life, but, appeared, to, suffer, no, ill, effects, plutonium, is, more, dangerous, if, inhaled, than, if, ingested, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, increases, once, the, total, radiation, dose, equivalent, of, inhaled, plutonium, exceeds, 400, msv, the, u, s, department, of, energy, estimates, that, the, lifetime, cancer, risk, from, inhaling, 5, 000, plutonium, particles, each, about, 3, m, wide, is, 1, over, the, background, u, s, average, ingestion, or, inhalation, of, large, amounts, may, cause, acute, radiation, poisoning, and, possibly, death, however, no, human, being, is, known, to, have, died, because, of, inhaling, or, ingesting, plutonium, and, many, people, have, measurable, amounts, of, plutonium, in, their, bodies, the, hot, particle, theory, in, which, a, particle, of, plutonium, dust, irradiates, a, localized, spot, of, lung, tissue, is, not, supported, by, mainstream, research, such, particles, are, more, mobile, than, originally, thought, and, toxicity, is, not, measurably, increased, due, to, particulate, form, when, inhaled, plutonium, can, pass, into, the, bloodstream, once, in, the, bloodstream, plutonium, moves, throughout, the, body, and, into, the, bones, liver, or, other, body, organs, plutonium, that, reaches, body, organs, generally, stays, in, the, body, for, decades, and, continues, to, expose, the, surrounding, tissue, to, radiation, and, thus, may, cause, cancer, a, commonly, cited, quote, by, ralph, nader, states, that, a, pound, of, plutonium, dust, spread, into, the, atmosphere, would, be, enough, to, kill, 8, billion, people, this, was, disputed, by, bernard, cohen, an, opponent, of, the, generally, accepted, linear, no, threshold, model, of, radiation, toxicity, cohen, estimated, that, one, pound, of, plutonium, could, kill, no, more, than, 2, million, people, by, inhalation, so, that, the, toxicity, of, plutonium, is, roughly, equivalent, with, that, of, nerve, gas, several, populations, of, people, who, have, been, exposed, to, plutonium, dust, e, g, people, living, down, wind, of, nevada, test, sites, nagasaki, survivors, nuclear, facility, workers, and, terminally, ill, patients, injected, with, pu, in, 1945, 46, to, study, pu, metabolism, have, been, carefully, followed, and, analyzed, cohen, found, these, studies, inconsistent, with, high, estimates, of, plutonium, toxicity, citing, cases, such, as, albert, stevens, who, survived, into, old, age, after, being, injected, with, plutonium, there, were, about, 25, workers, from, los, alamos, national, laboratory, who, inhaled, a, considerable, amount, of, plutonium, dust, during, 1940s, according, to, the, hot, particle, theory, each, of, them, has, a, 99, 5, chance, of, being, dead, from, lung, cancer, by, now, but, there, has, not, been, a, single, lung, cancer, among, them, plutonium, is, known, to, enter, the, marine, environment, by, dumping, of, waste, or, accidental, leakage, from, nuclear, plants, though, the, highest, concentrations, of, plutonium, in, marine, environments, are, found, in, sediments, the, complex, biogeochemical, cycle, of, plutonium, means, it, is, also, found, in, all, other, compartments, for, example, various, zooplankton, species, that, aid, in, the, nutrient, cycle, will, consume, the, element, on, a, daily, basis, the, complete, excretion, of, ingested, plutonium, by, zooplankton, makes, their, defecation, an, extremely, important, mechanism, in, the, scavenging, of, plutonium, from, surface, waters, however, those, zooplankton, that, succumb, to, predation, by, larger, organisms, may, become, a, transmission, vehicle, of, plutonium, to, fish, in, addition, to, consumption, fish, can, also, be, exposed, to, plutonium, by, their, distribution, around, the, globe, one, study, investigated, the, effects, of, transuranium, elements, plutonium, 238, plutonium, 239, plutonium, 240, on, various, fish, living, in, the, chernobyl, exclusion, zone, cez, results, showed, that, a, proportion, of, female, perch, in, the, cez, displayed, either, a, failure, or, delay, in, maturation, of, the, gonads, similar, studies, found, large, accumulations, of, plutonium, in, the, respiratory, and, digestive, organs, of, cod, flounder, and, herring, plutonium, toxicity, is, just, as, detrimental, to, larvae, of, fish, in, nuclear, waste, areas, undeveloped, eggs, have, a, higher, risk, than, developed, adult, fish, exposed, to, the, element, in, these, waste, areas, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, displayed, that, carp, and, minnow, embryos, raised, in, solutions, containing, plutonium, did, not, hatch, eggs, that, hatched, displayed, significant, abnormalities, when, compared, to, control, developed, embryos, it, revealed, that, higher, concentrations, of, plutonium, have, been, found, to, cause, issues, in, marine, fauna, exposed, to, the, element, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, the, accumulation, of, amounts, of, plutonium, which, approach, critical, mass, particularly, because, plutonium, s, critical, mass, is, only, a, third, of, that, of, uranium, 235, a, critical, mass, of, plutonium, emits, lethal, amounts, of, neutrons, and, gamma, rays, plutonium, in, solution, is, more, likely, to, form, a, critical, mass, than, the, solid, form, due, to, moderation, by, the, hydrogen, in, water, criticality, accidents, have, occurred, sometimes, killing, people, careless, handling, of, tungsten, carbide, bricks, around, a, 6, 2, kg, plutonium, sphere, resulted, in, a, fatal, dose, of, radiation, at, los, alamos, on, august, 21, 1945, when, scientist, harry, daghlian, received, a, dose, estimated, at, 5, 1, sievert, 510, rem, and, died, 25, days, later, nine, months, later, another, los, alamos, scientist, louis, slotin, died, from, a, similar, accident, involving, a, beryllium, reflector, and, the, same, plutonium, core, the, demon, core, that, had, previously, killed, daghlian, in, december, 1958, during, a, process, of, purifying, plutonium, at, los, alamos, a, critical, mass, formed, in, a, mixing, vessel, which, killed, chemical, operator, cecil, kelley, other, nuclear, accidents, have, occurred, in, the, soviet, union, japan, the, united, states, and, many, other, countries, metallic, plutonium, is, a, fire, hazard, especially, if, finely, divided, in, a, moist, environment, plutonium, forms, hydrides, on, its, surface, which, are, pyrophoric, and, may, ignite, in, air, at, room, temperature, plutonium, expands, up, to, 70, in, volume, as, it, oxidizes, and, thus, may, break, its, container, the, radioactivity, of, the, burning, material, is, another, hazard, magnesium, oxide, sand, is, probably, the, most, effective, material, for, extinguishing, a, plutonium, fire, it, cools, the, burning, material, acting, as, a, heat, sink, and, also, blocks, off, oxygen, special, precautions, are, necessary, to, store, or, handle, plutonium, in, any, form, generally, a, dry, inert, gas, atmosphere, is, required, the, usual, transport, of, plutonium, is, through, the, more, stable, plutonium, oxide, in, a, sealed, package, a, typical, transport, consists, of, one, truck, carrying, one, protected, shipping, container, holding, a, number, of, packages, with, a, total, weight, varying, from, 80, to, 200, kg, of, plutonium, oxide, a, sea, shipment, may, consist, of, several, containers, each, holding, a, sealed, package, the, u, s, nuclear, regulatory, commission, dictates, that, it, must, be, solid, instead, of, powder, if, the, contents, surpass, 0, 74, tbq, 20, curies, of, radioactivity, in, 2016, the, ships, pacific, egret, and, pacific, heron, of, pacific, nuclear, transport, ltd, transported, 331, kg, 730, lbs, of,
