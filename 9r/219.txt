the, big, bang, is, a, physical, theory, that, describes, how, the, universe, expanded, from, an, initial, state, of, high, density, and, temperature, the, notion, of, an, expanding, universe, was, first, scientifically, originated, by, physicist, alexander, friedmann, in, 1922, with, the, mathematical, derivation, of, the, friedmann, equations, independent, of, friedmann, s, work, the, big, bang, was, first, proposed, in, 1931, by, roman, catholic, priest, and, physicist, georges, lema, tre, when, he, suggested, the, universe, emerged, from, a, primeval, atom, various, cosmological, models, of, the, big, bang, explain, the, evolution, of, the, observable, universe, from, the, earliest, known, periods, through, its, subsequent, large, scale, form, these, models, offer, a, comprehensive, explanation, for, a, broad, range, of, observed, phenomena, including, the, abundance, of, light, elements, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, radiation, and, large, scale, structure, the, uniformity, of, the, universe, known, as, the, flatness, problem, is, explained, through, cosmic, inflation, a, sudden, and, very, rapid, expansion, of, space, during, the, earliest, moments, crucially, these, models, are, compatible, with, the, hubble, lema, tre, law, the, observation, that, the, farther, away, a, galaxy, is, the, faster, it, is, moving, away, from, earth, extrapolating, this, cosmic, expansion, backward, in, time, using, the, known, laws, of, physics, the, models, describe, an, increasingly, concentrated, cosmos, preceded, by, a, singularity, in, which, space, and, time, lose, meaning, typically, named, the, big, bang, singularity, physics, lacks, a, widely, accepted, theory, of, quantum, gravity, that, can, model, the, earliest, conditions, of, the, big, bang, in, 1964, the, cmb, was, discovered, which, convinced, many, cosmologists, that, the, competing, steady, state, model, of, cosmic, evolution, was, falsified, since, the, big, bang, models, predict, a, uniform, background, radiation, caused, by, high, temperatures, and, densities, in, the, distant, past, a, wide, range, of, empirical, evidence, strongly, favors, the, big, bang, event, which, is, now, essentially, universally, accepted, detailed, measurements, of, the, expansion, rate, of, the, universe, place, the, big, bang, singularity, at, an, estimated, 13, 787, 0, 020, billion, years, ago, which, is, considered, the, age, of, the, universe, there, remain, aspects, of, the, observed, universe, that, are, not, yet, adequately, explained, by, the, big, bang, models, after, its, initial, expansion, the, universe, cooled, sufficiently, to, allow, the, formation, of, subatomic, particles, and, later, atoms, the, unequal, abundances, of, matter, and, antimatter, that, allowed, this, to, occur, is, an, unexplained, effect, known, as, baryon, asymmetry, these, primordial, elements, mostly, hydrogen, with, some, helium, and, lithium, later, coalesced, through, gravity, forming, early, stars, and, galaxies, astronomers, observe, the, gravitational, effects, of, an, unknown, dark, matter, surrounding, galaxies, most, of, the, gravitational, potential, in, the, universe, seems, to, be, in, this, form, and, the, big, bang, models, and, various, observations, indicate, that, this, excess, gravitational, potential, is, not, created, by, baryonic, matter, such, as, normal, atoms, measurements, of, the, redshifts, of, supernovae, indicate, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, an, observation, attributed, to, an, unexplained, phenomenon, known, as, dark, energy, the, big, bang, models, offer, a, comprehensive, explanation, for, a, broad, range, of, observed, phenomena, including, the, abundances, of, the, light, elements, the, cmb, large, scale, structure, and, hubble, s, law, the, models, depend, on, two, major, assumptions, the, universality, of, physical, laws, and, the, cosmological, principle, the, universality, of, physical, laws, is, one, of, the, underlying, principles, of, the, theory, of, relativity, the, cosmological, principle, states, that, on, large, scales, the, universe, is, homogeneous, and, isotropic, appearing, the, same, in, all, directions, regardless, of, location, these, ideas, were, initially, taken, as, postulates, but, later, efforts, were, made, to, test, each, of, them, for, example, the, first, assumption, has, been, tested, by, observations, showing, that, the, largest, possible, deviation, of, the, fine, structure, constant, over, much, of, the, age, of, the, universe, is, of, order, 10, 5, also, general, relativity, has, passed, stringent, tests, on, the, scale, of, the, solar, system, and, binary, stars, the, large, scale, universe, appears, isotropic, as, viewed, from, earth, if, it, is, indeed, isotropic, the, cosmological, principle, can, be, derived, from, the, simpler, copernican, principle, which, states, that, there, is, no, preferred, or, special, observer, or, vantage, point, to, this, end, the, cosmological, principle, has, been, confirmed, to, a, level, of, 10, 5, via, observations, of, the, temperature, of, the, cmb, at, the, scale, of, the, cmb, horizon, the, universe, has, been, measured, to, be, homogeneous, with, an, upper, bound, on, the, order, of, 10, inhomogeneity, as, of, 1995, an, important, feature, of, the, big, bang, spacetime, is, the, presence, of, particle, horizons, since, the, universe, has, a, finite, age, and, light, travels, at, a, finite, speed, there, may, be, events, in, the, past, whose, light, has, not, yet, had, time, to, reach, earth, this, places, a, limit, or, a, past, horizon, on, the, most, distant, objects, that, can, be, observed, conversely, because, space, is, expanding, and, more, distant, objects, are, receding, ever, more, quickly, light, emitted, by, us, today, may, never, catch, up, to, very, distant, objects, this, defines, a, future, horizon, which, limits, the, events, in, the, future, that, we, will, be, able, to, influence, the, presence, of, either, type, of, horizon, depends, on, the, details, of, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, flrw, metric, that, describes, the, expansion, of, the, universe, our, understanding, of, the, universe, back, to, very, early, times, suggests, that, there, is, a, past, horizon, though, in, practice, our, view, is, also, limited, by, the, opacity, of, the, universe, at, early, times, so, our, view, cannot, extend, further, backward, in, time, though, the, horizon, recedes, in, space, if, the, expansion, of, the, universe, continues, to, accelerate, there, is, a, future, horizon, as, well, some, processes, in, the, early, universe, occurred, too, slowly, compared, to, the, expansion, rate, of, the, universe, to, reach, approximate, thermodynamic, equilibrium, others, were, fast, enough, to, reach, thermalization, the, parameter, usually, used, to, find, out, whether, a, process, in, the, very, early, universe, has, reached, thermal, equilibrium, is, the, ratio, between, the, rate, of, the, process, usually, rate, of, collisions, between, particles, and, the, hubble, parameter, the, larger, the, ratio, the, more, time, particles, had, to, thermalize, before, they, were, too, far, away, from, each, other, according, to, the, big, bang, models, the, universe, at, the, beginning, was, very, hot, and, very, compact, and, since, then, it, has, been, expanding, and, cooling, in, the, absence, of, a, perfect, cosmological, principle, extrapolation, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, backwards, in, time, using, general, relativity, yields, an, infinite, density, and, temperature, at, a, finite, time, in, the, past, this, irregular, behavior, known, as, the, gravitational, singularity, indicates, that, general, relativity, is, not, an, adequate, description, of, the, laws, of, physics, in, this, regime, models, based, on, general, relativity, alone, cannot, fully, extrapolate, toward, the, singularity, in, some, proposals, such, as, the, emergent, universe, models, the, singularity, is, replaced, by, another, cosmological, epoch, a, different, approach, identifies, the, initial, singularity, as, a, singularity, predicted, by, some, models, of, the, big, bang, theory, to, have, existed, before, the, big, bang, event, this, primordial, singularity, is, itself, sometimes, called, the, big, bang, but, the, term, can, also, refer, to, a, more, generic, early, hot, dense, phase, of, the, universe, in, either, case, the, big, bang, as, an, event, is, also, colloquially, referred, to, as, the, birth, of, our, universe, since, it, represents, the, point, in, history, where, the, universe, can, be, verified, to, have, entered, into, a, regime, where, the, laws, of, physics, as, we, understand, them, specifically, general, relativity, and, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, work, based, on, measurements, of, the, expansion, using, type, ia, supernovae, and, measurements, of, temperature, fluctuations, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, time, that, has, passed, since, that, event, known, as, the, age, of, the, universe, is, 13, 8, billion, years, despite, being, extremely, dense, at, this, time, far, denser, than, is, usually, required, to, form, a, black, hole, the, universe, did, not, re, collapse, into, a, singularity, commonly, used, calculations, and, limits, for, explaining, gravitational, collapse, are, usually, based, upon, objects, of, relatively, constant, size, such, as, stars, and, do, not, apply, to, rapidly, expanding, space, such, as, the, big, bang, since, the, early, universe, did, not, immediately, collapse, into, a, multitude, of, black, holes, matter, at, that, time, must, have, been, very, evenly, distributed, with, a, negligible, density, gradient, the, earliest, phases, of, the, big, bang, are, subject, to, much, speculation, given, the, lack, of, available, data, in, the, most, common, models, the, universe, was, filled, homogeneously, and, isotropically, with, a, very, high, energy, density, and, huge, temperatures, and, pressures, and, was, very, rapidly, expanding, and, cooling, the, period, up, to, 10, 43, seconds, into, the, expansion, the, planck, epoch, was, a, phase, in, which, the, four, fundamental, forces, the, electromagnetic, force, the, strong, nuclear, force, the, weak, nuclear, force, and, the, gravitational, force, were, unified, as, one, in, this, stage, the, characteristic, scale, length, of, the, universe, was, the, planck, length, 1, 6, 10, 35, m, and, consequently, had, a, temperature, of, approximately, 10, 32, degrees, celsius, even, the, very, concept, of, a, particle, breaks, down, in, these, conditions, a, proper, understanding, of, this, period, awaits, the, development, of, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, the, planck, epoch, was, succeeded, by, the, grand, unification, epoch, beginning, at, 10, 43, seconds, where, gravitation, separated, from, the, other, forces, as, the, universe, s, temperature, fell, at, approximately, 10, 37, seconds, into, the, expansion, a, phase, transition, caused, a, cosmic, inflation, during, which, the, universe, grew, exponentially, unconstrained, by, the, light, speed, invariance, and, temperatures, dropped, by, a, factor, of, 100, 000, this, concept, is, motivated, by, the, flatness, problem, where, the, density, of, matter, and, energy, is, very, close, to, the, critical, density, needed, to, produce, a, flat, universe, that, is, the, shape, of, the, universe, has, no, overall, geometric, curvature, due, to, gravitational, influence, microscopic, quantum, fluctuations, that, occurred, because, of, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, were, frozen, in, by, inflation, becoming, amplified, into, the, seeds, that, would, later, form, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, at, a, time, around, 10, 36, seconds, the, electroweak, epoch, begins, when, the, strong, nuclear, force, separates, from, the, other, forces, with, only, the, electromagnetic, force, and, weak, nuclear, force, remaining, unified, inflation, stopped, locally, at, around, 10, 33, to, 10, 32, seconds, with, the, observable, universe, s, volume, having, increased, by, a, factor, of, at, least, 10, 78, reheating, followed, as, the, inflaton, field, decayed, until, the, universe, obtained, the, temperatures, required, for, the, production, of, a, quark, gluon, plasma, as, well, as, all, other, elementary, particles, temperatures, were, so, high, that, the, random, motions, of, particles, were, at, relativistic, speeds, and, particle, antiparticle, pairs, of, all, kinds, were, being, continuously, created, and, destroyed, in, collisions, at, some, point, an, unknown, reaction, called, baryogenesis, violated, the, conservation, of, baryon, number, leading, to, a, very, small, excess, of, quarks, and, leptons, over, antiquarks, and, antileptons, of, the, order, of, one, part, in, 30, million, this, resulted, in, the, predominance, of, matter, over, antimatter, in, the, present, universe, the, universe, continued, to, decrease, in, density, and, fall, in, temperature, hence, the, typical, energy, of, each, particle, was, decreasing, symmetry, breaking, phase, transitions, put, the, fundamental, forces, of, physics, and, the, parameters, of, elementary, particles, into, their, present, form, with, the, electromagnetic, force, and, weak, nuclear, force, separating, at, about, 10, 12, seconds, after, about, 10, 11, seconds, the, picture, becomes, less, speculative, since, particle, energies, drop, to, values, that, can, be, attained, in, particle, accelerators, at, about, 10, 6, seconds, quarks, and, gluons, combined, to, form, baryons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, the, small, excess, of, quarks, over, antiquarks, led, to, a, small, excess, of, baryons, over, antibaryons, the, temperature, was, no, longer, high, enough, to, create, either, new, proton, antiproton, or, neutron, antineutron, pairs, a, mass, annihilation, immediately, followed, leaving, just, one, in, 10, 8, of, the, original, matter, particles, and, none, of, their, antiparticles, a, similar, process, happened, at, about, 1, second, for, electrons, and, positrons, after, these, annihilations, the, remaining, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, were, no, longer, moving, relativistically, and, the, energy, density, of, the, universe, was, dominated, by, photons, with, a, minor, contribution, from, neutrinos, a, few, minutes, into, the, expansion, when, the, temperature, was, about, a, billion, kelvin, and, the, density, of, matter, in, the, universe, was, comparable, to, the, current, density, of, earth, s, atmosphere, neutrons, combined, with, protons, to, form, the, universe, s, deuterium, and, helium, nuclei, in, a, process, called, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, bbn, most, protons, remained, uncombined, as, hydrogen, nuclei, as, the, universe, cooled, the, rest, energy, density, of, matter, came, to, gravitationally, dominate, that, of, the, photon, radiation, the, recombination, epoch, began, after, about, 379, 000, years, when, the, electrons, and, nuclei, combined, into, atoms, mostly, hydrogen, which, were, able, to, emit, radiation, this, relic, radiation, which, continued, through, space, largely, unimpeded, is, known, as, the, cosmic, microwave, background, after, the, recombination, epoch, the, slightly, denser, regions, of, the, uniformly, distributed, matter, gravitationally, attracted, nearby, matter, and, thus, grew, even, denser, forming, gas, clouds, stars, galaxies, and, the, other, astronomical, structures, observable, today, the, details, of, this, process, depend, on, the, amount, and, type, of, matter, in, the, universe, the, four, possible, types, of, matter, are, known, as, cold, dark, matter, cdm, warm, dark, matter, hot, dark, matter, and, baryonic, matter, the, best, measurements, available, from, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, wmap, show, that, the, data, is, well, fit, by, a, lambda, cdm, model, in, which, dark, matter, is, assumed, to, be, cold, warm, dark, matter, is, ruled, out, by, early, reionization, this, cdm, is, estimated, to, make, up, about, 23, of, the, matter, energy, of, the, universe, while, baryonic, matter, makes, up, about, 4, 6, in, an, extended, model, which, includes, hot, dark, matter, in, the, form, of, neutrinos, then, the, physical, baryon, density, b, h, 2, displaystyle, omega, text, b, h, 2, is, estimated, at, 0, 023, this, is, different, from, the, baryon, density, b, displaystyle, omega, text, b, expressed, as, a, fraction, of, the, total, matter, energy, density, which, is, about, 0, 046, the, corresponding, cold, dark, matter, density, c, h, 2, displaystyle, omega, text, c, h, 2, is, about, 0, 11, and, the, corresponding, neutrino, density, v, h, 2, displaystyle, omega, text, v, h, 2, is, estimated, to, be, less, than, 0, 0062, independent, lines, of, evidence, from, type, ia, supernovae, and, the, cmb, imply, that, the, universe, today, is, dominated, by, a, mysterious, form, of, energy, known, as, dark, energy, which, appears, to, homogeneously, permeate, all, of, space, observations, suggest, that, 73, of, the, total, energy, density, of, the, present, day, universe, is, in, this, form, when, the, universe, was, very, young, it, was, likely, infused, with, dark, energy, but, with, everything, closer, together, gravity, predominated, braking, the, expansion, eventually, after, billions, of, years, of, expansion, the, declining, density, of, matter, relative, to, the, density, of, dark, energy, allowed, the, expansion, of, the, universe, to, begin, to, accelerate, dark, energy, in, its, simplest, formulation, is, modeled, by, a, cosmological, constant, term, in, einstein, field, equations, of, general, relativity, but, its, composition, and, mechanism, are, unknown, more, generally, the, details, of, its, equation, of, state, and, relationship, with, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, continue, to, be, investigated, both, through, observation, and, theory, all, of, this, cosmic, evolution, after, the, inflationary, epoch, can, be, rigorously, described, and, modeled, by, the, lambda, cdm, model, of, cosmology, which, uses, the, independent, frameworks, of, quantum, mechanics, and, general, relativity, there, are, no, easily, testable, models, that, would, describe, the, situation, prior, to, approximately, 10, 15, seconds, understanding, this, earliest, of, eras, in, the, history, of, the, universe, is, one, of, the, greatest, unsolved, problems, in, physics, english, astronomer, fred, hoyle, is, credited, with, coining, the, term, big, bang, during, a, talk, for, a, march, 1949, bbc, radio, broadcast, saying, these, theories, were, based, on, the, hypothesis, that, all, the, matter, in, the, universe, was, created, in, one, big, bang, at, a, particular, time, in, the, remote, past, however, it, did, not, catch, on, until, the, 1970s, it, is, popularly, reported, that, hoyle, who, favored, an, alternative, steady, state, cosmological, model, intended, this, to, be, pejorative, but, hoyle, explicitly, denied, this, and, said, it, was, just, a, striking, image, meant, to, highlight, the, difference, between, the, two, models, helge, kragh, writes, that, the, evidence, for, the, claim, that, it, was, meant, as, a, pejorative, is, unconvincing, and, mentions, a, number, of, indications, that, it, was, not, a, pejorative, the, term, itself, has, been, argued, to, be, a, misnomer, because, it, evokes, an, explosion, the, argument, is, that, whereas, an, explosion, suggests, expansion, into, a, surrounding, space, the, big, bang, only, describes, the, intrinsic, expansion, of, the, contents, of, the, universe, another, issue, pointed, out, by, santhosh, mathew, is, that, bang, implies, sound, which, is, not, an, important, feature, of, the, model, an, attempt, to, find, a, more, suitable, alternative, was, not, successful, the, big, bang, models, developed, from, observations, of, the, structure, of, the, universe, and, from, theoretical, considerations, in, 1912, vesto, slipher, measured, the, first, doppler, shift, of, a, spiral, nebula, spiral, nebula, is, the, obsolete, term, for, spiral, galaxies, and, soon, discovered, that, almost, all, such, nebulae, were, receding, from, earth, he, did, not, grasp, the, cosmological, implications, of, this, fact, and, indeed, at, the, time, it, was, highly, controversial, whether, or, not, these, nebulae, were, island, universes, outside, our, milky, way, ten, years, later, alexander, friedmann, a, russian, cosmologist, and, mathematician, derived, the, friedmann, equations, from, the, einstein, field, equations, showing, that, the, universe, might, be, expanding, in, contrast, to, the, static, universe, model, advocated, by, albert, einstein, at, that, time, in, 1924, american, astronomer, edwin, hubble, s, measurement, of, the, great, distance, to, the, nearest, spiral, nebulae, showed, that, these, systems, were, indeed, other, galaxies, starting, that, same, year, hubble, painstakingly, developed, a, series, of, distance, indicators, the, forerunner, of, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, using, the, 100, inch, 2, 5, m, hooker, telescope, at, mount, wilson, observatory, this, allowed, him, to, estimate, distances, to, galaxies, whose, redshifts, had, already, been, measured, mostly, by, slipher, in, 1929, hubble, discovered, a, correlation, between, distance, and, recessional, velocity, now, known, as, hubble, s, law, independently, deriving, friedmann, s, equations, in, 1927, georges, lema, tre, a, belgian, physicist, and, roman, catholic, priest, proposed, that, the, recession, of, the, nebulae, was, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, he, inferred, the, relation, that, hubble, would, later, observe, given, the, cosmological, principle, in, 1931, lema, tre, went, further, and, suggested, that, the, evident, expansion, of, the, universe, if, projected, back, in, time, meant, that, the, further, in, the, past, the, smaller, the, universe, was, until, at, some, finite, time, in, the, past, all, the, mass, of, the, universe, was, concentrated, into, a, single, point, a, primeval, atom, where, and, when, the, fabric, of, time, and, space, came, into, existence, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, almost, every, major, cosmologist, preferred, an, eternal, steady, state, universe, and, several, complained, that, the, beginning, of, time, implied, by, the, big, bang, imported, religious, concepts, into, physics, this, objection, was, later, repeated, by, supporters, of, the, steady, state, theory, this, perception, was, enhanced, by, the, fact, that, the, originator, of, the, big, bang, concept, lema, tre, was, a, roman, catholic, priest, arthur, eddington, agreed, with, aristotle, that, the, universe, did, not, have, a, beginning, in, time, viz, that, matter, is, eternal, a, beginning, in, time, was, repugnant, to, him, lema, tre, however, disagreed, if, the, world, has, begun, with, a, single, quantum, the, notions, of, space, and, time, would, altogether, fail, to, have, any, meaning, at, the, beginning, they, would, only, begin, to, have, a, sensible, meaning, when, the, original, quantum, had, been, divided, into, a, sufficient, number, of, quanta, if, this, suggestion, is, correct, the, beginning, of, the, world, happened, a, little, before, the, beginning, of, space, and, time, during, the, 1930s, other, ideas, were, proposed, as, non, standard, cosmologies, to, explain, hubble, s, observations, including, the, milne, model, the, oscillatory, universe, originally, suggested, by, friedmann, but, advocated, by, albert, einstein, and, richard, c, tolman, and, fritz, zwicky, s, tired, light, hypothesis, after, world, war, ii, two, distinct, possibilities, emerged, one, was, fred, hoyle, s, steady, state, model, whereby, new, matter, would, be, created, as, the, universe, seemed, to, expand, in, this, model, the, universe, is, roughly, the, same, at, any, point, in, time, the, other, was, lema, tre, s, big, bang, theory, advocated, and, developed, by, george, gamow, who, introduced, bbn, and, whose, associates, ralph, alpher, and, robert, herman, predicted, the, cmb, ironically, it, was, hoyle, who, coined, the, phrase, that, came, to, be, applied, to, lema, tre, s, theory, referring, to, it, as, this, big, bang, idea, during, a, bbc, radio, broadcast, in, march, 1949, for, a, while, support, was, split, between, these, two, theories, eventually, the, observational, evidence, most, notably, from, radio, source, counts, began, to, favor, big, bang, over, steady, state, the, discovery, and, confirmation, of, the, cmb, in, 1964, secured, the, big, bang, as, the, best, theory, of, the, origin, and, evolution, of, the, universe, in, 1968, and, 1970, roger, penrose, stephen, hawking, and, george, f, r, ellis, published, papers, where, they, showed, that, mathematical, singularities, were, an, inevitable, initial, condition, of, relativistic, models, of, the, big, bang, then, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1990s, cosmologists, worked, on, characterizing, the, features, of, the, big, bang, universe, and, resolving, outstanding, problems, in, 1981, alan, guth, made, a, breakthrough, in, theoretical, work, on, resolving, certain, outstanding, theoretical, problems, in, the, big, bang, models, with, the, introduction, of, an, epoch, of, rapid, expansion, in, the, early, universe, he, called, inflation, meanwhile, during, these, decades, two, questions, in, observational, cosmology, that, generated, much, discussion, and, disagreement, were, over, the, precise, values, of, the, hubble, constant, and, the, matter, density, of, the, universe, before, the, discovery, of, dark, energy, thought, to, be, the, key, predictor, for, the, eventual, fate, of, the, universe, in, the, mid, 1990s, observations, of, certain, globular, clusters, appeared, to, indicate, that, they, were, about, 15, billion, years, old, which, conflicted, with, most, then, current, estimates, of, the, age, of, the, universe, and, indeed, with, the, age, measured, today, this, issue, was, later, resolved, when, new, computer, simulations, which, included, the, effects, of, mass, loss, due, to, stellar, winds, indicated, a, much, younger, age, for, globular, clusters, significant, progress, in, big, bang, cosmology, has, been, made, since, the, late, 1990s, as, a, result, of, advances, in, telescope, technology, as, well, as, the, analysis, of, data, from, satellites, such, as, the, cosmic, background, explorer, cobe, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, wmap, cosmologists, now, have, fairly, precise, and, accurate, measurements, of, many, of, the, parameters, of, the, big, bang, model, and, have, made, the, unexpected, discovery, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, appears, to, be, accelerating, big, bang, picture, is, too, firmly, grounded, in, data, from, every, area, to, be, proved, invalid, in, its, general, features, lawrence, krauss, the, earliest, and, most, direct, observational, evidence, of, the, validity, of, the, theory, are, the, expansion, of, the, universe, according, to, hubble, s, law, as, indicated, by, the, redshifts, of, galaxies, discovery, and, measurement, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, and, the, relative, abundances, of, light, elements, produced, by, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, bbn, more, recent, evidence, includes, observations, of, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, and, the, distribution, of, large, scale, cosmic, structures, these, are, sometimes, called, the, four, pillars, of, the, big, bang, models, precise, modern, models, of, the, big, bang, appeal, to, various, exotic, physical, phenomena, that, have, not, been, observed, in, terrestrial, laboratory, experiments, or, incorporated, into, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, of, these, features, dark, matter, is, currently, the, subject, of, most, active, laboratory, investigations, remaining, issues, include, the, cuspy, halo, problem, and, the, dwarf, galaxy, problem, of, cold, dark, matter, dark, energy, is, also, an, area, of, intense, interest, for, scientists, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, direct, detection, of, dark, energy, will, be, possible, inflation, and, baryogenesis, remain, more, speculative, features, of, current, big, bang, models, viable, quantitative, explanations, for, such, phenomena, are, still, being, sought, these, are, unsolved, problems, in, physics, observations, of, distant, galaxies, and, quasars, show, that, these, objects, are, redshifted, the, light, emitted, from, them, has, been, shifted, to, longer, wavelengths, this, can, be, seen, by, taking, a, frequency, spectrum, of, an, object, and, matching, the, spectroscopic, pattern, of, emission, or, absorption, lines, corresponding, to, atoms, of, the, chemical, elements, interacting, with, the, light, these, redshifts, are, uniformly, isotropic, distributed, evenly, among, the, observed, objects, in, all, directions, if, the, redshift, is, interpreted, as, a, doppler, shift, the, recessional, velocity, of, the, object, can, be, calculated, for, some, galaxies, it, is, possible, to, estimate, distances, via, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, when, the, recessional, velocities, are, plotted, against, these, distances, a, linear, relationship, known, as, hubble, s, law, is, observed, v, h, 0, d, displaystyle, v, h, 0, d, where, hubble, s, law, implies, that, the, universe, is, uniformly, expanding, everywhere, this, cosmic, expansion, was, predicted, from, general, relativity, by, friedmann, in, 1922, and, lema, tre, in, 1927, well, before, hubble, made, his, 1929, analysis, and, observations, and, it, remains, the, cornerstone, of, the, big, bang, model, as, developed, by, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, and, walker, the, theory, requires, the, relation, v, h, d, displaystyle, v, hd, to, hold, at, all, times, where, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, proper, distance, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, recessional, velocity, and, v, displaystyle, v, h, displaystyle, h, and, d, displaystyle, d, vary, as, the, universe, expands, hence, we, write, h, 0, displaystyle, h, 0, to, denote, the, present, day, hubble, constant, for, distances, much, smaller, than, the, size, of, the, observable, universe, the, hubble, redshift, can, be, thought, of, as, the, doppler, shift, corresponding, to, the, recession, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, for, distances, comparable, to, the, size, of, the, observable, universe, the, attribution, of, the, cosmological, redshift, becomes, more, ambiguous, although, its, interpretation, as, a, kinematic, doppler, shift, remains, the, most, natural, one, an, unexplained, discrepancy, with, the, determination, of, the, hubble, constant, is, known, as, hubble, tension, techniques, based, on, observation, of, the, cmb, suggest, a, lower, value, of, this, constant, compared, to, the, quantity, derived, from, measurements, based, on, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, in, 1964, arno, penzias, and, robert, wilson, serendipitously, discovered, the, cosmic, background, radiation, an, omnidirectional, signal, in, the, microwave, band, their, discovery, provided, substantial, confirmation, of, the, big, bang, predictions, by, alpher, herman, and, gamow, around, 1950, through, the, 1970s, the, radiation, was, found, to, be, approximately, consistent, with, a, blackbody, spectrum, in, all, directions, this, spectrum, has, been, redshifted, by, the, expansion, of, the, universe, and, today, corresponds, to, approximately, 2, 725, k, this, tipped, the, balance, of, evidence, in, favor, of, the, big, bang, model, and, penzias, and, wilson, were, awarded, the, 1978, nobel, prize, in, physics, the, surface, of, last, scattering, corresponding, to, emission, of, the, cmb, occurs, shortly, after, recombination, the, epoch, when, neutral, hydrogen, becomes, stable, prior, to, this, the, universe, comprised, a, hot, dense, photon, baryon, plasma, sea, where, photons, were, quickly, scattered, from, free, charged, particles, peaking, at, around, 372, 14, kyr, the, mean, free, path, for, a, photon, becomes, long, enough, to, reach, the, present, day, and, the, universe, becomes, transparent, in, 1989, nasa, launched, cobe, which, made, two, major, advances, in, 1990, high, precision, spectrum, measurements, showed, that, the, cmb, frequency, spectrum, is, an, almost, perfect, blackbody, with, no, deviations, at, a, level, of, 1, part, in, 10, 4, and, measured, a, residual, temperature, of, 2, 726, k, more, recent, measurements, have, revised, this, figure, down, slightly, to, 2, 7255, k, then, in, 1992, further, cobe, measurements, discovered, tiny, fluctuations, anisotropies, in, the, cmb, temperature, across, the, sky, at, a, level, of, about, one, part, in, 10, 5, john, c, mather, and, george, smoot, were, awarded, the, 2006, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, leadership, in, these, results, during, the, following, decade, cmb, anisotropies, were, further, investigated, by, a, large, number, of, ground, based, and, balloon, experiments, in, 2000, 2001, several, experiments, most, notably, boomerang, found, the, shape, of, the, universe, to, be, spatially, almost, flat, by, measuring, the, typical, angular, size, the, size, on, the, sky, of, the, anisotropies, in, early, 2003, the, first, results, of, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, were, released, yielding, what, were, at, the, time, the, most, accurate, values, for, some, of, the, cosmological, parameters, the, results, disproved, several, specific, cosmic, inflation, models, but, are, consistent, with, the, inflation, theory, in, general, the, planck, space, probe, was, launched, in, may, 2009, other, ground, and, balloon, based, cosmic, microwave, background, experiments, are, ongoing, using, big, bang, models, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, expected, concentration, of, the, isotopes, helium, 4, 4, he, helium, 3, 3, he, deuterium, 2, h, and, lithium, 7, 7, li, in, the, universe, as, ratios, to, the, amount, of, ordinary, hydrogen, the, relative, abundances, depend, on, a, single, parameter, the, ratio, of, photons, to, baryons, this, value, can, be, calculated, independently, from, the, detailed, structure, of, cmb, fluctuations, the, ratios, predicted, by, mass, not, by, abundance, are, about, 0, 25, for, 4, he, h, about, 10, 3, for, 2, h, h, about, 10, 4, for, 3, he, h, and, about, 10, 9, for, 7, li, h, the, measured, abundances, all, agree, at, least, roughly, with, those, predicted, from, a, single, value, of, the, baryon, to, photon, ratio, the, agreement, is, excellent, for, deuterium, close, but, formally, discrepant, for, 4, he, and, off, by, a, factor, of, two, for, 7, li, this, anomaly, is, known, as, the, cosmological, lithium, problem, in, the, latter, two, cases, there, are, substantial, systematic, uncertainties, nonetheless, the, general, consistency, with, abundances, predicted, by, bbn, is, strong, evidence, for, the, big, bang, as, the, theory, is, the, only, known, explanation, for, the, relative, abundances, of, light, elements, and, it, is, virtually, impossible, to, tune, the, big, bang, to, produce, much, more, or, less, than, 20, 30, helium, indeed, there, is, no, obvious, reason, outside, of, the, big, bang, that, for, example, the, young, universe, before, star, formation, as, determined, by, studying, matter, supposedly, free, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, products, should, have, more, helium, than, deuterium, or, more, deuterium, than, 3, he, and, in, constant, ratios, too, 182, 185, detailed, observations, of, the, morphology, and, distribution, of, galaxies, and, quasars, are, in, agreement, with, the, current, big, bang, models, a, combination, of, observations, and, theory, suggest, that, the, first, quasars, and, galaxies, formed, within, a, billion, years, after, the, big, bang, and, since, then, larger, structures, have, been, forming, such, as, galaxy, clusters, and, superclusters, populations, of, stars, have, been, aging, and, evolving, so, that, distant, galaxies, which, are, observed, as, they, were, in, the, early, universe, appear, very, different, from, nearby, galaxies, observed, in, a, more, recent, state, moreover, galaxies, that, formed, relatively, recently, appear, markedly, different, from, galaxies, formed, at, similar, distances, but, shortly, after, the, big, bang, these, observations, are, strong, arguments, against, the, steady, state, model, observations, of, star, formation, galaxy, and, quasar, distributions, and, larger, structures, agree, well, with, big, bang, simulations, of, the, formation, of, structure, in, the, universe, and, are, helping, to, complete, details, of, the, theory, in, 2011, astronomers, found, what, they, believe, to, be, pristine, clouds, of, primordial, gas, by, analyzing, absorption, lines, in, the, spectra, of, distant, quasars, before, this, discovery, all, other, astronomical, objects, have, been, observed, to, contain, heavy, elements, that, are, formed, in, stars, despite, being, sensitive, to, carbon, oxygen, and, silicon, these, three, elements, were, not, detected, in, these, two, clouds, since, the, clouds, of, gas, have, no, detectable, levels, of, heavy, elements, they, likely, formed, in, the, first, few, minutes, after, the, big, bang, during, bbn, the, age, of, the, universe, as, estimated, from, the, hubble, expansion, and, the, cmb, is, now, in, agreement, with, other, estimates, using, the, ages, of, the, oldest, stars, both, as, measured, by, applying, the, theory, of, stellar, evolution, to, globular, clusters, and, through, radiometric, dating, of, individual, population, ii, stars, it, is, also, in, agreement, with, age, estimates, based, on, measurements, of, the, expansion, using, type, ia, supernovae, and, measurements, of, temperature, fluctuations, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, agreement, of, independent, measurements, of, this, age, supports, the, lambda, cdm, cdm, model, since, the, model, is, used, to, relate, some, of, the, measurements, to, an, age, estimate, and, all, estimates, turn, agree, still, some, observations, of, objects, from, the, relatively, early, universe, in, particular, quasar, apm, 08279, 5255, raise, concern, as, to, whether, these, objects, had, enough, time, to, form, so, early, in, the, cdm, model, the, prediction, that, the, cmb, temperature, was, higher, in, the, past, has, been, experimentally, supported, by, observations, of, very, low, temperature, absorption, lines, in, gas, clouds, at, high, redshift, this, prediction, also, implies, that, the, amplitude, of, the, sunyaev, zel, dovich, effect, in, clusters, of, galaxies, does, not, depend, directly, on, redshift, observations, have, found, this, to, be, roughly, true, but, this, effect, depends, on, cluster, properties, that, do, change, with, cosmic, time, making, precise, measurements, difficult, future, gravitational, wave, observatories, might, be, able, to, detect, primordial, gravitational, waves, relics, of, the, early, universe, up, to, less, than, a, second, after, the, big, bang, as, with, any, theory, a, number, of, mysteries, and, problems, have, arisen, as, a, result, of, the, development, of, the, big, bang, models, some, of, these, mysteries, and, problems, have, been, resolved, while, others, are, still, outstanding, proposed, solutions, to, some, of, the, problems, in, the, big, bang, model, have, revealed, new, mysteries, of, their, own, for, example, the, horizon, problem, the, magnetic, monopole, problem, and, the, flatness, problem, are, most, commonly, resolved, with, inflation, theory, but, the, details, of, the, inflationary, universe, are, still, left, unresolved, and, many, including, some, founders, of, the, theory, say, it, has, been, disproven, what, follows, are, a, list, of, the, mysterious, aspects, of, the, big, bang, concept, still, under, intense, investigation, by, cosmologists, and, astrophysicists, it, is, not, yet, understood, why, the, universe, has, more, matter, than, antimatter, it, is, generally, assumed, that, when, the, universe, was, young, and, very, hot, it, was, in, statistical, equilibrium, and, contained, equal, numbers, of, baryons, and, antibaryons, however, observations, suggest, that, the, universe, including, its, most, distant, parts, is, made, almost, entirely, of, normal, matter, rather, than, antimatter, a, process, called, baryogenesis, was, hypothesized, to, account, for, the, asymmetry, for, baryogenesis, to, occur, the, sakharov, conditions, must, be, satisfied, these, require, that, baryon, number, is, not, conserved, that, c, symmetry, and, cp, symmetry, are, violated, and, that, the, universe, depart, from, thermodynamic, equilibrium, all, these, conditions, occur, in, the, standard, model, but, the, effects, are, not, strong, enough, to, explain, the, present, baryon, asymmetry, measurements, of, the, redshift, magnitude, relation, for, type, ia, supernovae, indicate, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, has, been, accelerating, since, the, universe, was, about, half, its, present, age, to, explain, this, acceleration, general, relativity, requires, that, much, of, the, energy, in, the, universe, consists, of, a, component, with, large, negative, pressure, dubbed, dark, energy, dark, energy, though, speculative, solves, numerous, problems, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, indicate, that, the, universe, is, very, nearly, spatially, flat, and, therefore, according, to, general, relativity, the, universe, must, have, almost, exactly, the, critical, density, of, mass, energy, but, the, mass, density, of, the, universe, can, be, measured, from, its, gravitational, clustering, and, is, found, to, have, only, about, 30, of, the, critical, density, since, theory, suggests, that, dark, energy, does, not, cluster, in, the, usual, way, it, is, the, best, explanation, for, the, missing, energy, density, dark, energy, also, helps, to, explain, two, geometrical, measures, of, the, overall, curvature, of, the, universe, one, using, the, frequency, of, gravitational, lenses, and, the, other, using, the, characteristic, pattern, of, the, large, scale, structure, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, as, a, cosmic, ruler, negative, pressure, is, believed, to, be, a, property, of, vacuum, energy, but, the, exact, nature, and, existence, of, dark, energy, remains, one, of, the, great, mysteries, of, the, big, bang, results, from, the, wmap, team, in, 2008, are, in, accordance, with, a, universe, that, consists, of, 73, dark, energy, 23, dark, matter, 4, 6, regular, matter, and, less, than, 1, neutrinos, according, to, theory, the, energy, density, in, matter, decreases, with, the, expansion, of, the, universe, but, the, dark, energy, density, remains, constant, or, nearly, so, as, the, universe, expands, therefore, matter, made, up, a, larger, fraction, of, the, total, energy, of, the, universe, in, the, past, than, it, does, today, but, its, fractional, contribution, will, fall, in, the, far, future, as, dark, energy, becomes, even, more, dominant, the, dark, energy, component, of, the, universe, has, been, explained, by, theorists, using, a, variety, of, competing, theories, including, einstein, s, cosmological, constant, but, also, extending, to, more, exotic, forms, of, quintessence, or, other, modified, gravity, schemes, a, cosmological, constant, problem, sometimes, called, the, most, embarrassing, problem, in, physics, results, from, the, apparent, discrepancy, between, the, measured, energy, density, of, dark, energy, and, the, one, naively, predicted, from, planck, units, during, the, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, various, observations, showed, that, there, is, not, sufficient, visible, matter, in, the, universe, to, account, for, the, apparent, strength, of, gravitational, forces, within, and, between, galaxies, this, led, to, the, idea, that, up, to, 90, of, the, matter, in, the, universe, is, dark, matter, that, does, not, emit, light, or, interact, with, normal, baryonic, matter, in, addition, the, assumption, that, the, universe, is, mostly, normal, matter, led, to, predictions, that, were, strongly, inconsistent, with, observations, in, particular, the, universe, today, is, far, more, lumpy, and, contains, far, less, deuterium, than, can, be, accounted, for, without, dark, matter, while, dark, matter, has, always, been, controversial, it, is, inferred, by, various, observations, the, anisotropies, in, the, cmb, galaxy, cluster, velocity, dispersions, large, scale, structure, distributions, gravitational, lensing, studies, and, x, ray, measurements, of, galaxy, clusters, indirect, evidence, for, dark, matter, comes, from, its, gravitational, influence, on, other, matter, as, no, dark, matter, particles, have, been, observed, in, laboratories, many, particle, physics, candidates, for, dark, matter, have, been, proposed, and, several, projects, to, detect, them, directly, are, underway, additionally, there, are, outstanding, problems, associated, with, the, currently, favored, cold, dark, matter, model, which, include, the, dwarf, galaxy, problem, and, the, cuspy, halo, problem, alternative, theories, have, been, proposed, that, do, not, require, a, large, amount, of, undetected, matter, but, instead, modify, the, laws, of, gravity, established, by, newton, and, einstein, yet, no, alternative, theory, has, been, as, successful, as, the, cold, dark, matter, proposal, in, explaining, all, extant, observations, the, horizon, problem, results, from, the, premise, that, information, cannot, travel, faster, than, light, in, a, universe, of, finite, age, this, sets, a, limit, the, particle, horizon, on, the, separation, of, any, two, regions, of, space, that, are, in, causal, contact, the, observed, isotropy, of, the, cmb, is, problematic, in, this, regard, if, the, universe, had, been, dominated, by, radiation, or, matter, at, all, times, up, to, the, epoch, of, last, scattering, the, particle, horizon, at, that, time, would, correspond, to, about, 2, degrees, on, the, sky, there, would, then, be, no, mechanism, to, cause, wider, regions, to, have, the, same, temperature, 191, 202, a, resolution, to, this, apparent, inconsistency, is, offered, by, inflation, theory, in, which, a, homogeneous, and, isotropic, scalar, energy, field, dominates, the, universe, at, some, very, early, period, before, baryogenesis, during, inflation, the, universe, undergoes, exponential, expansion, and, the, particle, horizon, expands, much, more, rapidly, than, previously, assumed, so, that, regions, presently, on, opposite, sides, of, the, observable, universe, are, well, inside, each, other, s, particle, horizon, the, observed, isotropy, of, the, cmb, then, follows, from, the, fact, that, this, larger, region, was, in, causal, contact, before, the, beginning, of, inflation, 180, 186, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, predicts, that, during, the, inflationary, phase, there, would, be, quantum, thermal, fluctuations, which, would, be, magnified, to, a, cosmic, scale, these, fluctuations, served, as, the, seeds, for, all, the, current, structures, in, the, universe, 207, inflation, predicts, that, the, primordial, fluctuations, are, nearly, scale, invariant, and, gaussian, which, has, been, confirmed, by, measurements, of, the, cmb, sec, 6, a, related, issue, to, the, classic, horizon, problem, arises, because, in, most, standard, cosmological, inflation, models, inflation, ceases, well, before, electroweak, symmetry, breaking, occurs, so, inflation, should, not, be, able, to, prevent, large, scale, discontinuities, in, the, electroweak, vacuum, since, distant, parts, of, the, observable, universe, were, causally, separate, when, the, electroweak, epoch, ended, the, magnetic, monopole, objection, was, raised, in, the, late, 1970s, grand, unified, theories, guts, predicted, topological, defects, in, space, that, would, manifest, as, magnetic, monopoles, these, objects, would, be, produced, efficiently, in, the, hot, early, universe, resulting, in, a, density, much, higher, than, is, consistent, with, observations, given, that, no, monopoles, have, been, found, this, problem, is, resolved, by, cosmic, inflation, which, removes, all, point, defects, from, the, observable, universe, in, the, same, way, that, it, drives, the, geometry, to, flatness, the, flatness, problem, also, known, as, the, oldness, problem, is, an, observational, problem, associated, with, a, flrw, the, universe, may, have, positive, negative, or, zero, spatial, curvature, depending, on, its, total, energy, density, curvature, is, negative, if, its, density, is, less, than, the, critical, density, positive, if, greater, and, zero, at, the, critical, density, in, which, case, space, is, said, to, be, flat, observations, indicate, the, universe, is, consistent, with, being, flat, the, problem, is, that, any, small, departure, from, the, critical, density, grows, with, time, and, yet, the, universe, today, remains, very, close, to, flat, given, that, a, natural, timescale, for, departure, from, flatness, might, be, the, planck, time, 10, 43, seconds, the, fact, that, the, universe, has, reached, neither, a, heat, death, nor, a, big, crunch, after, billions, of, years, requires, an, explanation, for, instance, even, at, the, relatively, late, age, of, a, few, minutes, the, time, of, nucleosynthesis, the, density, of, the, universe, must, have, been, within, one, part, in, 10, 14, of, its, critical, value, or, it, would, not, exist, as, it, does, today, one, of, the, common, misconceptions, about, the, big, bang, model, is, that, it, fully, explains, the, origin, of, the, universe, however, the, big, bang, model, does, not, describe, how, energy, time, and, space, were, caused, but, rather, it, describes, the, emergence, of, the, present, universe, from, an, ultra, dense, and, high, temperature, initial, state, it, is, misleading, to, visualize, the, big, bang, by, comparing, its, size, to, everyday, objects, when, the, size, of, the, universe, at, big, bang, is, described, it, refers, to, the, size, of, the, observable, universe, and, not, the, entire, universe, another, common, misconception, is, that, the, big, bang, must, be, understood, as, the, expansion, of, space, and, not, in, terms, of, the, contents, of, space, exploding, apart, in, fact, either, description, can, be, accurate, the, expansion, of, space, implied, by, the, flrw, metric, is, only, a, mathematical, convention, corresponding, to, a, choice, of, coordinates, on, spacetime, there, is, no, generally, covariant, sense, in, which, space, expands, the, recession, speeds, associated, with, hubble, s, law, are, not, velocities, in, a, relativistic, sense, for, example, they, are, not, related, to, the, spatial, components, of, 4, velocities, therefore, it, is, not, remarkable, that, according, to, hubble, s, law, galaxies, farther, than, the, hubble, distance, recede, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, such, recession, speeds, do, not, correspond, to, faster, than, light, travel, many, popular, accounts, attribute, the, cosmological, redshift, to, the, expansion, of, space, this, can, be, misleading, because, the, expansion, of, space, is, only, a, coordinate, choice, the, most, natural, interpretation, of, the, cosmological, redshift, is, that, it, is, a, doppler, shift, given, current, understanding, scientific, extrapolations, about, the, future, of, the, universe, are, only, possible, for, finite, durations, albeit, for, much, longer, periods, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, anything, beyond, that, becomes, increasingly, speculative, likewise, at, present, a, proper, understanding, of, the, origin, of, the, universe, can, only, be, subject, to, conjecture, the, big, bang, explains, the, evolution, of, the, universe, from, a, starting, density, and, temperature, that, is, well, beyond, humanity, s, capability, to, replicate, so, extrapolations, to, the, most, extreme, conditions, and, earliest, times, are, necessarily, more, speculative, lema, tre, called, this, initial, state, the, primeval, atom, while, gamow, called, the, material, ylem, how, the, initial, state, of, the, universe, originated, is, still, an, open, question, but, the, big, bang, model, does, constrain, some, of, its, characteristics, for, example, if, specific, laws, of, nature, were, to, come, to, existence, in, a, random, way, inflation, models, show, some, combinations, of, these, are, far, more, probable, partly, explaining, why, our, universe, is, rather, stable, another, possible, explanation, for, the, stability, of, the, universe, could, be, a, hypothetical, multiverse, which, assumes, every, possible, universe, to, exist, and, thinking, species, could, only, emerge, in, those, stable, enough, a, flat, universe, implies, a, balance, between, gravitational, potential, energy, and, other, energy, forms, requiring, no, additional, energy, to, be, created, the, big, bang, theory, built, upon, the, equations, of, classical, general, relativity, indicates, a, singularity, at, the, origin, of, cosmic, time, and, such, an, infinite, energy, density, may, be, a, physical, impossibility, however, the, physical, theories, of, general, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, as, currently, realized, are, not, applicable, before, the, planck, epoch, and, correcting, this, will, require, the, development, of, a, correct, treatment, of, quantum, gravity, certain, quantum, gravity, treatments, such, as, the, wheeler, dewitt, equation, imply, that, time, itself, could, be, an, emergent, property, as, such, physics, may, conclude, that, time, did, not, exist, before, the, big, bang, while, it, is, not, known, what, could, have, preceded, the, hot, dense, state, of, the, early, universe, or, how, and, why, it, originated, or, even, whether, such, questions, are, sensible, speculation, abounds, on, the, subject, of, cosmogony, some, speculative, proposals, in, this, regard, each, of, which, entails, untested, hypotheses, are, proposals, in, the, last, two, categories, see, the, big, bang, as, an, event, in, either, a, much, larger, and, older, universe, or, in, a, multiverse, before, observations, of, dark, energy, cosmologists, considered, two, scenarios, for, the, future, of, the, universe, if, the, mass, density, of, the, universe, were, greater, than, the, critical, density, then, the, universe, would, reach, a, maximum, size, and, then, begin, to, collapse, it, would, become, denser, and, hotter, again, ending, with, a, state, similar, to, that, in, which, it, started, a, big, crunch, alternatively, if, the, density, in, the, universe, were, equal, to, or, below, the, critical, density, the, expansion, would, slow, down, but, never, stop, star, formation, would, cease, with, the, consumption, of, interstellar, gas, in, each, galaxy, stars, would, burn, out, leaving, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, collisions, between, these, would, result, in, mass, accumulating, into, larger, and, larger, black, holes, the, average, temperature, of, the, universe, would, very, gradually, asymptotically, approach, absolute, zero, a, big, freeze, moreover, if, protons, are, unstable, then, baryonic, matter, would, disappear, leaving, only, radiation, and, black, holes, eventually, black, holes, would, evaporate, by, emitting, hawking, radiation, the, entropy, of, the, universe, would, increase, to, the, point, where, no, organized, form, of, energy, could, be, extracted, from, it, a, scenario, known, as, heat, death, modern, observations, of, accelerating, expansion, imply, that, more, and, more, of, the, currently, visible, universe, will, pass, beyond, our, event, horizon, and, out, of, contact, with, us, the, eventual, result, is, not, known, the, cdm, model, of, the, universe, contains, dark, energy, in, the, form, of, a, cosmological, constant, this, theory, suggests, that, only, gravitationally, bound, systems, such, as, galaxies, will, remain, together, and, they, too, will, be, subject, to, heat, death, as, the, universe, expands, and, cools, other, explanations, of, dark, energy, called, phantom, energy, theories, suggest, that, ultimately, galaxy, clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and, matter, itself, will, be, torn, apart, by, the, ever, increasing, expansion, in, a, so, called, big, rip, as, a, description, of, the, origin, of, the, universe, the, big, bang, has, significant, bearing, on, religion, and, philosophy, as, a, result, it, has, become, one, of, the, liveliest, areas, in, the, discourse, between, science, and, religion, some, believe, the, big, bang, implies, a, creator, while, others, argue, that, big, bang, cosmology, makes, the, notion, of, a, creator, superfluous
