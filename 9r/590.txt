igneous, rock, igneous, from, latin, igneus, fiery, or, magmatic, rock, is, one, of, the, three, main, rock, types, the, others, being, sedimentary, and, metamorphic, igneous, rocks, are, formed, through, the, cooling, and, solidification, of, magma, or, lava, the, magma, can, be, derived, from, partial, melts, of, existing, rocks, in, either, a, planet, s, mantle, or, crust, typically, the, melting, is, caused, by, one, or, more, of, three, processes, an, increase, in, temperature, a, decrease, in, pressure, or, a, change, in, composition, solidification, into, rock, occurs, either, below, the, surface, as, intrusive, rocks, or, on, the, surface, as, extrusive, rocks, igneous, rock, may, form, with, crystallization, to, form, granular, crystalline, rocks, or, without, crystallization, to, form, natural, glasses, igneous, rocks, occur, in, a, wide, range, of, geological, settings, shields, platforms, orogens, basins, large, igneous, provinces, extended, crust, and, oceanic, crust, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, make, up, 90, 95, of, the, top, 16, kilometres, 9, 9, mi, of, the, earth, s, crust, by, volume, igneous, rocks, form, about, 15, of, the, earth, s, current, land, surface, most, of, the, earth, s, oceanic, crust, is, made, of, igneous, rock, igneous, rocks, are, also, geologically, important, because, igneous, rocks, can, be, either, intrusive, plutonic, and, hypabyssal, or, extrusive, volcanic, intrusive, igneous, rocks, make, up, the, majority, of, igneous, rocks, and, are, formed, from, magma, that, cools, and, solidifies, within, the, crust, of, a, planet, bodies, of, intrusive, rock, are, known, as, intrusions, and, are, surrounded, by, pre, existing, rock, called, country, rock, the, country, rock, is, an, excellent, thermal, insulator, so, the, magma, cools, slowly, and, intrusive, rocks, are, coarse, grained, phaneritic, the, mineral, grains, in, such, rocks, can, generally, be, identified, with, the, naked, eye, intrusions, can, be, classified, according, to, the, shape, and, size, of, the, intrusive, body, and, its, relation, to, the, bedding, of, the, country, rock, into, which, it, intrudes, typical, intrusive, bodies, are, batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills, and, dikes, common, intrusive, rocks, are, granite, gabbro, or, diorite, the, central, cores, of, major, mountain, ranges, consist, of, intrusive, igneous, rocks, when, exposed, by, erosion, these, cores, called, batholiths, may, occupy, huge, areas, of, the, earth, s, surface, intrusive, igneous, rocks, that, form, at, depth, within, the, crust, are, termed, plutonic, or, abyssal, rocks, and, are, usually, coarse, grained, intrusive, igneous, rocks, that, form, near, the, surface, are, termed, subvolcanic, or, hypabyssal, rocks, and, they, are, usually, much, finer, grained, often, resembling, volcanic, rock, hypabyssal, rocks, are, less, common, than, plutonic, or, volcanic, rocks, and, often, form, dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or, phacoliths, extrusive, igneous, rock, also, known, as, volcanic, rock, is, formed, by, the, cooling, of, molten, magma, on, the, earth, s, surface, the, magma, which, is, brought, to, the, surface, through, fissures, or, volcanic, eruptions, rapidly, solidifies, hence, such, rocks, are, fine, grained, aphanitic, or, even, glassy, basalt, is, the, most, common, extrusive, igneous, rock, and, forms, lava, flows, lava, sheets, and, lava, plateaus, some, kinds, of, basalt, solidify, to, form, long, polygonal, columns, the, giant, s, causeway, in, antrim, northern, ireland, is, an, example, the, molten, rock, which, typically, contains, suspended, crystals, and, dissolved, gases, is, called, magma, it, rises, because, it, is, less, dense, than, the, rock, from, which, it, was, extracted, when, magma, reaches, the, surface, it, is, called, lava, eruptions, of, volcanoes, into, air, are, termed, subaerial, whereas, those, occurring, underneath, the, ocean, are, termed, submarine, black, smokers, and, mid, ocean, ridge, basalt, are, examples, of, submarine, volcanic, activity, the, volume, of, extrusive, rock, erupted, annually, by, volcanoes, varies, with, plate, tectonic, setting, extrusive, rock, is, produced, in, the, following, proportions, the, behaviour, of, lava, depends, upon, its, viscosity, which, is, determined, by, temperature, composition, and, crystal, content, high, temperature, magma, most, of, which, is, basaltic, in, composition, behaves, in, a, manner, similar, to, thick, oil, and, as, it, cools, treacle, long, thin, basalt, flows, with, pahoehoe, surfaces, are, common, intermediate, composition, magma, such, as, andesite, tends, to, form, cinder, cones, of, intermingled, ash, tuff, and, lava, and, may, have, a, viscosity, similar, to, thick, cold, molasses, or, even, rubber, when, erupted, felsic, magma, such, as, rhyolite, is, usually, erupted, at, low, temperature, and, is, up, to, 10, 000, times, as, viscous, as, basalt, volcanoes, with, rhyolitic, magma, commonly, erupt, explosively, and, rhyolitic, lava, flows, are, typically, of, limited, extent, and, have, steep, margins, because, the, magma, is, so, viscous, felsic, and, intermediate, magmas, that, erupt, often, do, so, violently, with, explosions, driven, by, the, release, of, dissolved, gases, typically, water, vapour, but, also, carbon, dioxide, explosively, erupted, pyroclastic, material, is, called, tephra, and, includes, tuff, agglomerate, and, ignimbrite, fine, volcanic, ash, is, also, erupted, and, forms, ash, tuff, deposits, which, can, often, cover, vast, areas, because, volcanic, rocks, are, mostly, fine, grained, or, glassy, it, is, much, more, difficult, to, distinguish, between, the, different, types, of, extrusive, igneous, rocks, than, between, different, types, of, intrusive, igneous, rocks, generally, the, mineral, constituents, of, fine, grained, extrusive, igneous, rocks, can, only, be, determined, by, examination, of, thin, sections, of, the, rock, under, a, microscope, so, only, an, approximate, classification, can, usually, be, made, in, the, field, although, classification, by, mineral, makeup, is, preferred, by, the, iugs, this, is, often, impractical, and, chemical, classification, is, done, instead, using, the, tas, classification, igneous, rocks, are, classified, according, to, mode, of, occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical, composition, and, the, geometry, of, the, igneous, body, the, classification, of, the, many, types, of, igneous, rocks, can, provide, important, information, about, the, conditions, under, which, they, formed, two, important, variables, used, for, the, classification, of, igneous, rocks, are, particle, size, which, largely, depends, on, the, cooling, history, and, the, mineral, composition, of, the, rock, feldspars, quartz, or, feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and, micas, are, all, important, minerals, in, the, formation, of, almost, all, igneous, rocks, and, they, are, basic, to, the, classification, of, these, rocks, all, other, minerals, present, are, regarded, as, nonessential, in, almost, all, igneous, rocks, and, are, called, accessory, minerals, types, of, igneous, rocks, with, other, essential, minerals, are, very, rare, but, include, carbonatites, which, contain, essential, carbonates, in, a, simplified, compositional, classification, igneous, rock, types, are, categorized, into, felsic, or, mafic, based, on, the, abundance, of, silicate, minerals, in, the, bowen, s, series, rocks, dominated, by, quartz, plagioclase, alkali, feldspar, and, muscovite, are, felsic, mafic, rocks, are, primarily, composed, of, biotite, hornblende, pyroxene, and, olivine, generally, felsic, rocks, are, light, colored, and, mafic, rocks, are, darker, colored, for, textural, classification, igneous, rocks, that, have, crystals, large, enough, to, be, seen, by, the, naked, eye, are, called, phaneritic, those, with, crystals, too, small, to, be, seen, are, called, aphanitic, generally, speaking, phaneritic, implies, an, intrusive, origin, or, plutonic, indicating, slow, cooling, aphanitic, are, extrusive, or, volcanic, indicating, rapid, cooling, an, igneous, rock, with, larger, clearly, discernible, crystals, embedded, in, a, finer, grained, matrix, is, termed, porphyry, porphyritic, texture, develops, when, the, larger, crystals, called, phenocrysts, grow, to, considerable, size, before, the, main, mass, of, the, magma, crystallizes, as, finer, grained, uniform, material, called, groundmass, grain, size, in, igneous, rocks, results, from, cooling, time, so, porphyritic, rocks, are, created, when, the, magma, has, two, distinct, phases, of, cooling, igneous, rocks, are, classified, on, the, basis, of, texture, and, composition, texture, refers, to, the, size, shape, and, arrangement, of, the, mineral, grains, or, crystals, of, which, the, rock, is, composed, texture, is, an, important, criterion, for, the, naming, of, volcanic, rocks, the, texture, of, volcanic, rocks, including, the, size, shape, orientation, and, distribution, of, mineral, grains, and, the, intergrain, relationships, will, determine, whether, the, rock, is, termed, a, tuff, a, pyroclastic, lava, or, a, simple, lava, however, the, texture, is, only, a, subordinate, part, of, classifying, volcanic, rocks, as, most, often, there, needs, to, be, chemical, information, gleaned, from, rocks, with, extremely, fine, grained, groundmass, or, from, airfall, tuffs, which, may, be, formed, from, volcanic, ash, textural, criteria, are, less, critical, in, classifying, intrusive, rocks, where, the, majority, of, minerals, will, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, or, at, least, using, a, hand, lens, magnifying, glass, or, microscope, plutonic, rocks, also, tend, to, be, less, texturally, varied, and, less, prone, to, showing, distinctive, structural, fabrics, textural, terms, can, be, used, to, differentiate, different, intrusive, phases, of, large, plutons, for, instance, porphyritic, margins, to, large, intrusive, bodies, porphyry, stocks, and, subvolcanic, dikes, mineralogical, classification, is, most, often, used, to, classify, plutonic, rocks, chemical, classifications, are, preferred, to, classify, volcanic, rocks, with, phenocryst, species, used, as, a, prefix, e, g, olivine, bearing, picrite, or, orthoclase, phyric, rhyolite, the, iugs, recommends, classifying, igneous, rocks, by, their, mineral, composition, whenever, possible, this, is, straightforward, for, coarse, grained, intrusive, igneous, rock, but, may, require, examination, of, thin, sections, under, a, microscope, for, fine, grained, volcanic, rock, and, may, be, impossible, for, glassy, volcanic, rock, the, rock, must, then, be, classified, chemically, mineralogical, classification, of, an, intrusive, rock, begins, by, determining, if, the, rock, is, ultramafic, a, carbonatite, or, a, lamprophyre, an, ultramafic, rock, contains, more, than, 90, of, iron, and, magnesium, rich, minerals, such, as, hornblende, pyroxene, or, olivine, and, such, rocks, have, their, own, classification, scheme, likewise, rocks, containing, more, than, 50, carbonate, minerals, are, classified, as, carbonatites, while, lamprophyres, are, rare, ultrapotassic, rocks, both, are, further, classified, based, on, detailed, mineralogy, in, the, great, majority, of, cases, the, rock, has, a, more, typical, mineral, composition, with, significant, quartz, feldspars, or, feldspathoids, classification, is, based, on, the, percentages, of, quartz, alkali, feldspar, plagioclase, and, feldspathoid, out, of, the, total, fraction, of, the, rock, composed, of, these, minerals, ignoring, all, other, minerals, present, these, percentages, place, the, rock, somewhere, on, the, qapf, diagram, which, often, immediately, determines, the, rock, type, in, a, few, cases, such, as, the, diorite, gabbro, anorthite, field, additional, mineralogical, criteria, must, be, applied, to, determine, the, final, classification, where, the, mineralogy, of, an, volcanic, rock, can, be, determined, it, is, classified, using, the, same, procedure, but, with, a, modified, qapf, diagram, whose, fields, correspond, to, volcanic, rock, types, when, it, is, impractical, to, classify, a, volcanic, rock, by, mineralogy, the, rock, must, be, classified, chemically, there, are, relatively, few, minerals, that, are, important, in, the, formation, of, common, igneous, rocks, because, the, magma, from, which, the, minerals, crystallize, is, rich, in, only, certain, elements, silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and, magnesium, these, are, the, elements, that, combine, to, form, the, silicate, minerals, which, account, for, over, ninety, percent, of, all, igneous, rocks, the, chemistry, of, igneous, rocks, is, expressed, differently, for, major, and, minor, elements, and, for, trace, elements, contents, of, major, and, minor, elements, are, conventionally, expressed, as, weight, percent, oxides, e, g, 51, sio, 2, and, 1, 50, tio, 2, abundances, of, trace, elements, are, conventionally, expressed, as, parts, per, million, by, weight, e, g, 420, ppm, ni, and, 5, 1, ppm, sm, the, term, trace, element, is, typically, used, for, elements, present, in, most, rocks, at, abundances, less, than, 100, ppm, or, so, but, some, trace, elements, may, be, present, in, some, rocks, at, abundances, exceeding, 1, 000, ppm, the, diversity, of, rock, compositions, has, been, defined, by, a, huge, mass, of, analytical, data, over, 230, 000, rock, analyses, can, be, accessed, on, the, web, through, a, site, sponsored, by, the, u, s, national, science, foundation, see, the, external, link, to, earthchem, the, single, most, important, component, is, silica, sio, 2, whether, occurring, as, quartz, or, combined, with, other, oxides, as, feldspars, or, other, minerals, both, intrusive, and, volcanic, rocks, are, grouped, chemically, by, total, silica, content, into, broad, categories, this, classification, is, summarized, in, the, following, table, the, percentage, of, alkali, metal, oxides, na, 2, o, plus, k, 2, o, is, second, only, to, silica, in, its, importance, for, chemically, classifying, volcanic, rock, the, silica, and, alkali, metal, oxide, percentages, are, used, to, place, volcanic, rock, on, the, tas, diagram, which, is, sufficient, to, immediately, classify, most, volcanic, rocks, rocks, in, some, fields, such, as, the, trachyandesite, field, are, further, classified, by, the, ratio, of, potassium, to, sodium, so, that, potassic, trachyandesites, are, latites, and, sodic, trachyandesites, are, benmoreites, some, of, the, more, mafic, fields, are, further, subdivided, or, defined, by, normative, mineralogy, in, which, an, idealized, mineral, composition, is, calculated, for, the, rock, based, on, its, chemical, composition, for, example, basanite, is, distinguished, from, tephrite, by, having, a, high, normative, olivine, content, other, refinements, to, the, basic, tas, classification, include, in, older, terminology, silica, oversaturated, rocks, were, called, silicic, or, acidic, where, the, sio, 2, was, greater, than, 66, and, the, family, term, quartzolite, was, applied, to, the, most, silicic, a, normative, feldspathoid, classifies, a, rock, as, silica, undersaturated, an, example, is, nephelinite, magmas, are, further, divided, into, three, series, the, alkaline, series, is, distinguishable, from, the, other, two, on, the, tas, diagram, being, higher, in, total, alkali, oxides, for, a, given, silica, content, but, the, tholeiitic, and, calc, alkaline, series, occupy, approximately, the, same, part, of, the, tas, diagram, they, are, distinguished, by, comparing, total, alkali, with, iron, and, magnesium, content, these, three, magma, series, occur, in, a, range, of, plate, tectonic, settings, tholeiitic, magma, series, rocks, are, found, for, example, at, mid, ocean, ridges, back, arc, basins, oceanic, islands, formed, by, hotspots, island, arcs, and, continental, large, igneous, provinces, all, three, series, are, found, in, relatively, close, proximity, to, each, other, at, subduction, zones, where, their, distribution, is, related, to, depth, and, the, age, of, the, subduction, zone, the, tholeiitic, magma, series, is, well, represented, above, young, subduction, zones, formed, by, magma, from, relatively, shallow, depth, the, calc, alkaline, and, alkaline, series, are, seen, in, mature, subduction, zones, and, are, related, to, magma, of, greater, depths, andesite, and, basaltic, andesite, are, the, most, abundant, volcanic, rock, in, island, arc, which, is, indicative, of, the, calc, alkaline, magmas, some, island, arcs, have, distributed, volcanic, series, as, can, be, seen, in, the, japanese, island, arc, system, where, the, volcanic, rocks, change, from, tholeiite, calc, alkaline, alkaline, with, increasing, distance, from, the, trench, some, igneous, rock, names, date, to, before, the, modern, era, of, geology, for, example, basalt, as, a, description, of, a, particular, composition, of, lava, derived, rock, dates, to, georgius, agricola, in, 1546, in, his, work, de, natura, fossilium, the, word, granite, goes, back, at, least, to, the, 1640s, and, is, derived, either, from, french, granit, or, italian, granito, meaning, simply, granulate, rock, the, term, rhyolite, was, introduced, in, 1860, by, the, german, traveler, and, geologist, ferdinand, von, richthofen, the, naming, of, new, rock, types, accelerated, in, the, 19th, century, and, peaked, in, the, early, 20th, century, much, of, the, early, classification, of, igneous, rocks, was, based, on, the, geological, age, and, occurrence, of, the, rocks, however, in, 1902, the, american, petrologists, charles, whitman, cross, joseph, p, iddings, louis, v, pirsson, and, henry, stephens, washington, proposed, that, all, existing, classifications, of, igneous, rocks, should, be, discarded, and, replaced, by, a, quantitative, classification, based, on, chemical, analysis, they, showed, how, vague, and, often, unscientific, much, of, the, existing, terminology, was, and, argued, that, as, the, chemical, composition, of, an, igneous, rock, was, its, most, fundamental, characteristic, it, should, be, elevated, to, prime, position, geological, occurrence, structure, mineralogical, constitution, the, hitherto, accepted, criteria, for, the, discrimination, of, rock, species, were, relegated, to, the, background, the, completed, rock, analysis, is, first, to, be, interpreted, in, terms, of, the, rock, forming, minerals, which, might, be, expected, to, be, formed, when, the, magma, crystallizes, e, g, quartz, feldspars, olivine, akermannite, feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and, so, on, and, the, rocks, are, divided, into, groups, strictly, according, to, the, relative, proportion, of, these, minerals, to, one, another, this, new, classification, scheme, created, a, sensation, but, was, criticized, for, its, lack, of, utility, in, fieldwork, and, the, classification, scheme, was, abandoned, by, the, 1960s, however, the, concept, of, normative, mineralogy, has, endured, and, the, work, of, cross, and, his, coinvestigators, inspired, a, flurry, of, new, classification, schemes, among, these, was, the, classification, scheme, of, m, a, peacock, which, divided, igneous, rocks, into, four, series, the, alkalic, the, alkali, calcic, the, calc, alkali, and, the, calcic, series, his, definition, of, the, alkali, series, and, the, term, calc, alkali, continue, in, use, as, part, of, the, widely, used, irvine, barager, classification, along, with, w, q, kennedy, s, tholeiitic, series, by, 1958, there, were, some, 12, separate, classification, schemes, and, at, least, 1637, rock, type, names, in, use, in, that, year, albert, streckeisen, wrote, a, review, article, on, igneous, rock, classification, that, ultimately, led, to, the, formation, of, the, iugg, subcommission, of, the, systematics, of, igneous, rocks, by, 1989, a, single, system, of, classification, had, been, agreed, upon, which, was, further, revised, in, 2005, the, number, of, recommended, rock, names, was, reduced, to, 316, these, included, a, number, of, new, names, promulgated, by, the, subcommission, the, earth, s, crust, averages, about, 35, kilometres, 22, mi, thick, under, the, continents, but, averages, only, some, 7, 10, kilometres, 4, 3, 6, 2, mi, beneath, the, oceans, the, continental, crust, is, composed, primarily, of, sedimentary, rocks, resting, on, a, crystalline, basement, formed, of, a, great, variety, of, metamorphic, and, igneous, rocks, including, granulite, and, granite, oceanic, crust, is, composed, primarily, of, basalt, and, gabbro, both, continental, and, oceanic, crust, rest, on, peridotite, of, the, mantle, rocks, may, melt, in, response, to, a, decrease, in, pressure, to, a, change, in, composition, such, as, an, addition, of, water, to, an, increase, in, temperature, or, to, a, combination, of, these, processes, other, mechanisms, such, as, melting, from, a, meteorite, impact, are, less, important, today, but, impacts, during, the, accretion, of, the, earth, led, to, extensive, melting, and, the, outer, several, hundred, kilometres, of, our, early, earth, was, probably, an, ocean, of, magma, impacts, of, large, meteorites, in, the, last, few, hundred, million, years, have, been, proposed, as, one, mechanism, responsible, for, the, extensive, basalt, magmatism, of, several, large, igneous, provinces, decompression, melting, occurs, because, of, a, decrease, in, pressure, the, solidus, temperatures, of, most, rocks, the, temperatures, below, which, they, are, completely, solid, increase, with, increasing, pressure, in, the, absence, of, water, peridotite, at, depth, in, the, earth, s, mantle, may, be, hotter, than, its, solidus, temperature, at, some, shallower, level, if, such, rock, rises, during, the, convection, of, solid, mantle, it, will, cool, slightly, as, it, expands, in, an, adiabatic, process, but, the, cooling, is, only, about, 0, 3, c, per, kilometre, experimental, studies, of, appropriate, peridotite, samples, document, that, the, solidus, temperatures, increase, by, 3, c, to, 4, c, per, kilometre, if, the, rock, rises, far, enough, it, will, begin, to, melt, melt, droplets, can, coalesce, into, larger, volumes, and, be, intruded, upwards, this, process, of, melting, from, the, upward, movement, of, solid, mantle, is, critical, in, the, evolution, of, the, earth, decompression, melting, creates, the, ocean, crust, at, mid, ocean, ridges, it, also, causes, volcanism, in, intraplate, regions, such, as, europe, africa, and, the, pacific, sea, floor, there, it, is, variously, attributed, either, to, the, rise, of, mantle, plumes, the, plume, hypothesis, or, to, intraplate, extension, the, plate, hypothesis, the, change, of, rock, composition, most, responsible, for, the, creation, of, magma, is, the, addition, of, water, water, lowers, the, solidus, temperature, of, rocks, at, a, given, pressure, for, example, at, a, depth, of, about, 100, kilometres, peridotite, begins, to, melt, near, 800, c, in, the, presence, of, excess, water, but, near, or, above, about, 1, 500, c, in, the, absence, of, water, water, is, driven, out, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, in, subduction, zones, and, it, causes, melting, in, the, overlying, mantle, hydrous, magmas, composed, of, basalt, and, andesite, are, produced, directly, and, indirectly, as, results, of, dehydration, during, the, subduction, process, such, magmas, and, those, derived, from, them, build, up, island, arcs, such, as, those, in, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, these, magmas, form, rocks, of, the, calc, alkaline, series, an, important, part, of, the, continental, crust, the, addition, of, carbon, dioxide, is, relatively, a, much, less, important, cause, of, magma, formation, than, the, addition, of, water, but, genesis, of, some, silica, undersaturated, magmas, has, been, attributed, to, the, dominance, of, carbon, dioxide, over, water, in, their, mantle, source, regions, in, the, presence, of, carbon, dioxide, experiments, document, that, the, peridotite, solidus, temperature, decreases, by, about, 200, c, in, a, narrow, pressure, interval, at, pressures, corresponding, to, a, depth, of, about, 70, km, at, greater, depths, carbon, dioxide, can, have, more, effect, at, depths, to, about, 200, km, the, temperatures, of, initial, melting, of, a, carbonated, peridotite, composition, were, determined, to, be, 450, c, to, 600, c, lower, than, for, the, same, composition, with, no, carbon, dioxide, magmas, of, rock, types, such, as, nephelinite, carbonatite, and, kimberlite, are, among, those, that, may, be, generated, following, an, influx, of, carbon, dioxide, into, mantle, at, depths, greater, than, about, 70, km, increase, in, temperature, is, the, most, typical, mechanism, for, formation, of, magma, within, continental, crust, such, temperature, increases, can, occur, because, of, the, upward, intrusion, of, magma, from, the, mantle, temperatures, can, also, exceed, the, solidus, of, a, crustal, rock, in, continental, crust, thickened, by, compression, at, a, plate, boundary, the, plate, boundary, between, the, indian, and, asian, continental, masses, provides, a, well, studied, example, as, the, tibetan, plateau, just, north, of, the, boundary, has, crust, about, 80, kilometres, thick, roughly, twice, the, thickness, of, normal, continental, crust, studies, of, electrical, resistivity, deduced, from, magnetotelluric, data, have, detected, a, layer, that, appears, to, contain, silicate, melt, and, that, stretches, for, at, least, 1, 000, kilometres, within, the, middle, crust, along, the, southern, margin, of, the, tibetan, plateau, granite, and, rhyolite, are, types, of, igneous, rock, commonly, interpreted, as, products, of, the, melting, of, continental, crust, because, of, increases, in, temperature, temperature, increases, also, may, contribute, to, the, melting, of, lithosphere, dragged, down, in, a, subduction, zone, most, magmas, are, fully, melted, only, for, small, parts, of, their, histories, more, typically, they, are, mixes, of, melt, and, crystals, and, sometimes, also, of, gas, bubbles, melt, crystals, and, bubbles, usually, have, different, densities, and, so, they, can, separate, as, magmas, evolve, as, magma,
