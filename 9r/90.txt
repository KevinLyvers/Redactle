mercury, is, the, first, planet, from, the, sun, and, the, smallest, in, the, solar, system, in, english, it, is, named, after, the, ancient, roman, god, mercurius, mercury, god, of, commerce, and, communication, and, the, messenger, of, the, gods, mercury, is, classified, as, a, terrestrial, planet, with, roughly, the, same, surface, gravity, as, mars, the, surface, of, mercury, is, heavily, cratered, as, a, result, of, countless, impact, events, that, have, accumulated, over, billions, of, years, its, largest, crater, caloris, planitia, has, a, diameter, of, 1, 550, km, 960, mi, which, is, about, one, third, the, diameter, of, the, planet, 4, 880, km, or, 3, 030, mi, similarly, to, the, earth, s, moon, mercury, s, surface, displays, an, expansive, rupes, system, generated, from, thrust, faults, and, bright, ray, systems, formed, by, impact, event, remnants, mercury, s, sidereal, year, 88, 0, earth, days, and, sidereal, day, 58, 65, earth, days, are, in, a, 3, 2, ratio, this, relationship, is, called, spin, orbit, resonance, and, sidereal, here, means, relative, to, the, stars, consequently, one, solar, day, sunrise, to, sunrise, on, mercury, lasts, for, around, 176, earth, days, twice, the, planet, s, sidereal, year, this, means, that, one, side, of, mercury, will, remain, in, sunlight, for, one, mercurian, year, of, 88, earth, days, while, during, the, next, orbit, that, side, will, be, in, darkness, all, the, time, until, the, next, sunrise, after, another, 88, earth, days, combined, with, its, high, orbital, eccentricity, the, planet, s, surface, has, widely, varying, sunlight, intensity, and, temperature, with, the, equatorial, regions, ranging, from, 170, c, 270, f, at, night, to, 420, c, 790, f, during, sunlight, due, to, the, very, small, axial, tilt, the, planet, s, poles, are, permanently, shadowed, this, strongly, suggests, that, water, ice, could, be, present, in, the, craters, above, the, planet, s, surface, is, an, extremely, tenuous, exosphere, and, a, faint, magnetic, field, that, is, strong, enough, to, deflect, solar, winds, mercury, has, no, natural, satellite, as, of, the, early, 2020s, many, broad, details, of, mercury, s, geological, history, are, still, under, investigation, or, pending, data, from, space, probes, like, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, mercury, was, formed, approximately, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, its, mantle, is, highly, homogeneous, which, suggests, that, mercury, had, a, magma, ocean, early, in, its, history, like, the, moon, according, to, current, models, mercury, may, have, a, solid, silicate, crust, and, mantle, overlying, a, solid, outer, core, a, deeper, liquid, core, layer, and, a, solid, inner, core, there, are, many, competing, hypotheses, about, mercury, s, origins, and, development, some, of, which, incorporate, collision, with, planetesimals, and, rock, vaporization, the, ancients, knew, mercury, by, different, names, depending, on, whether, it, was, an, evening, star, or, a, morning, star, by, about, 350, bc, the, ancient, greeks, had, realized, the, two, stars, were, one, they, knew, the, planet, as, stilb, n, meaning, twinkling, and, herm, s, for, its, fleeting, motion, a, name, that, is, retained, in, modern, greek, ermis, the, romans, named, the, planet, after, the, swift, footed, roman, messenger, god, mercury, latin, mercurius, whom, they, equated, with, the, greek, hermes, because, it, moves, across, the, sky, faster, than, any, other, planet, the, astronomical, symbol, for, mercury, is, a, stylized, version, of, hermes, caduceus, a, christian, cross, was, added, in, the, 16th, century, mercury, is, one, of, four, terrestrial, planets, in, the, solar, system, which, means, it, is, a, rocky, body, like, earth, it, is, the, smallest, planet, in, the, solar, system, with, an, equatorial, radius, of, 2, 439, 7, kilometres, 1, 516, 0, mi, mercury, is, also, smaller, albeit, more, massive, than, the, largest, natural, satellites, in, the, solar, system, ganymede, and, titan, mercury, consists, of, approximately, 70, metallic, and, 30, silicate, material, mercury, appears, to, have, a, solid, silicate, crust, and, mantle, overlying, a, solid, metallic, outer, core, layer, a, deeper, liquid, core, layer, and, a, solid, inner, core, the, composition, of, the, iron, rich, core, remains, uncertain, but, it, likely, contains, nickel, silicon, and, perhaps, sulfur, and, carbon, plus, trace, amounts, of, other, elements, the, planet, s, density, is, the, second, highest, in, the, solar, system, at, 5, 427, g, cm, 3, only, slightly, less, than, earth, s, density, of, 5, 515, g, cm, 3, if, the, effect, of, gravitational, compression, were, to, be, factored, out, from, both, planets, the, materials, of, which, mercury, is, made, would, be, denser, than, those, of, earth, with, an, uncompressed, density, of, 5, 3, g, cm, 3, versus, earth, s, 4, 4, g, cm, 3, mercury, s, density, can, be, used, to, infer, details, of, its, inner, structure, although, earth, s, high, density, results, appreciably, from, gravitational, compression, particularly, at, the, core, mercury, is, much, smaller, and, its, inner, regions, are, not, as, compressed, therefore, for, it, to, have, such, a, high, density, its, core, must, be, large, and, rich, in, iron, the, radius, of, mercury, s, core, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 020, 30, km, 1, 255, 19, mi, based, on, interior, models, constrained, to, be, consistent, with, a, moment, of, inertia, factor, of, 0, 346, 0, 014, hence, mercury, s, core, occupies, about, 57, of, its, volume, for, earth, this, proportion, is, 17, research, published, in, 2007, suggests, that, mercury, has, a, molten, core, the, mantle, crust, layer, is, in, total, 420, km, 260, mi, thick, based, on, data, from, the, mariner, 10, and, messenger, missions, in, addition, to, earth, based, observation, mercury, s, crust, is, estimated, to, be, 35, km, 22, mi, thick, however, this, model, may, be, an, overestimate, and, the, crust, could, be, 26, 11, km, 16, 2, 6, 8, mi, thick, based, on, an, airy, isostacy, model, one, distinctive, feature, of, mercury, s, surface, is, the, presence, of, numerous, narrow, ridges, extending, up, to, several, hundred, kilometers, in, length, it, is, thought, that, these, were, formed, as, mercury, s, core, and, mantle, cooled, and, contracted, at, a, time, when, the, crust, had, already, solidified, mercury, s, core, has, a, higher, iron, content, than, that, of, any, other, planet, in, the, solar, system, and, several, theories, have, been, proposed, to, explain, this, the, most, widely, accepted, theory, is, that, mercury, originally, had, a, metal, silicate, ratio, similar, to, common, chondrite, meteorites, thought, to, be, typical, of, the, solar, system, s, rocky, matter, and, a, mass, approximately, 2, 25, times, its, current, mass, early, in, the, solar, system, s, history, mercury, may, have, been, struck, by, a, planetesimal, of, approximately, 1, 6, mercury, s, mass, and, several, thousand, kilometers, across, the, impact, would, have, stripped, away, much, of, the, original, crust, and, mantle, leaving, the, core, behind, as, a, relatively, major, component, a, similar, process, known, as, the, giant, impact, hypothesis, has, been, proposed, to, explain, the, formation, of, earth, s, moon, alternatively, mercury, may, have, formed, from, the, solar, nebula, before, the, sun, s, energy, output, had, stabilized, it, would, initially, have, had, twice, its, present, mass, but, as, the, protosun, contracted, temperatures, near, mercury, could, have, been, between, 2, 500, and, 3, 500, k, and, possibly, even, as, high, as, 10, 000, k, much, of, mercury, s, surface, rock, could, have, been, vaporized, at, such, temperatures, forming, an, atmosphere, of, rock, vapor, that, could, have, been, carried, away, by, the, solar, wind, a, third, hypothesis, proposes, that, the, solar, nebula, caused, drag, on, the, particles, from, which, mercury, was, accreting, which, meant, that, lighter, particles, were, lost, from, the, accreting, material, and, not, gathered, by, mercury, each, hypothesis, predicts, a, different, surface, composition, and, two, space, missions, have, been, tasked, with, making, observations, of, this, composition, the, first, messenger, which, ended, in, 2015, found, higher, than, expected, potassium, and, sulfur, levels, on, the, surface, suggesting, that, the, giant, impact, hypothesis, and, vaporization, of, the, crust, and, mantle, did, not, occur, because, said, potassium, and, sulfur, would, have, been, driven, off, by, the, extreme, heat, of, these, events, bepicolombo, which, will, arrive, at, mercury, in, 2025, will, make, observations, to, test, these, hypotheses, the, findings, so, far, would, seem, to, favor, the, third, hypothesis, however, further, analysis, of, the, data, is, needed, mercury, s, surface, is, similar, in, appearance, to, that, of, the, moon, showing, extensive, mare, like, plains, and, heavy, cratering, indicating, that, it, has, been, geologically, inactive, for, billions, of, years, it, is, more, heterogeneous, than, the, surface, of, mars, or, the, moon, both, of, which, contain, significant, stretches, of, similar, geology, such, as, maria, and, plateaus, albedo, features, are, areas, of, markedly, different, reflectivity, which, include, impact, craters, the, resulting, ejecta, and, ray, systems, larger, albedo, features, correspond, to, higher, reflectivity, plains, mercury, has, wrinkle, ridges, dorsa, moon, like, highlands, mountains, montes, plains, planitiae, escarpments, rupes, and, valleys, valles, the, planet, s, mantle, is, chemically, heterogeneous, suggesting, the, planet, went, through, a, magma, ocean, phase, early, in, its, history, crystallization, of, minerals, and, convective, overturn, resulted, in, a, layered, chemically, heterogeneous, crust, with, large, scale, variations, in, chemical, composition, observed, on, the, surface, the, crust, is, low, in, iron, but, high, in, sulfur, resulting, from, the, stronger, early, chemically, reducing, conditions, than, is, found, on, other, terrestrial, planets, the, surface, is, dominated, by, iron, poor, pyroxene, and, olivine, as, represented, by, enstatite, and, forsterite, respectively, along, with, sodium, rich, plagioclase, and, minerals, of, mixed, magnesium, calcium, and, iron, sulfide, the, less, reflective, regions, of, the, crust, are, high, in, carbon, most, likely, in, the, form, of, graphite, names, for, features, on, mercury, come, from, a, variety, of, sources, and, are, set, according, to, the, iau, planetary, nomenclature, system, names, coming, from, people, are, limited, to, the, deceased, craters, are, named, for, artists, musicians, painters, and, authors, who, have, made, outstanding, or, fundamental, contributions, to, their, field, ridges, or, dorsa, are, named, for, scientists, who, have, contributed, to, the, study, of, mercury, depressions, or, fossae, are, named, for, works, of, architecture, montes, are, named, for, the, word, hot, in, a, variety, of, languages, plains, or, planitiae, are, named, for, mercury, in, various, languages, escarpments, or, rup, s, are, named, for, ships, of, scientific, expeditions, valleys, or, valles, are, named, for, abandoned, cities, towns, or, settlements, of, antiquity, mercury, was, heavily, bombarded, by, comets, and, asteroids, during, and, shortly, following, its, formation, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, as, well, as, during, a, possibly, separate, subsequent, episode, called, the, late, heavy, bombardment, that, ended, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, mercury, received, impacts, over, its, entire, surface, during, this, period, of, intense, crater, formation, facilitated, by, the, lack, of, any, atmosphere, to, slow, impactors, down, during, this, time, mercury, was, volcanically, active, basins, were, filled, by, magma, producing, smooth, plains, similar, to, the, maria, found, on, the, moon, one, of, the, most, unusual, craters, is, apollodorus, or, the, spider, which, hosts, a, series, of, radiating, troughs, extending, outwards, from, its, impact, site, craters, on, mercury, range, in, diameter, from, small, bowl, shaped, cavities, to, multi, ringed, impact, basins, hundreds, of, kilometers, across, they, appear, in, all, states, of, degradation, from, relatively, fresh, rayed, craters, to, highly, degraded, crater, remnants, mercurian, craters, differ, subtly, from, lunar, craters, in, that, the, area, blanketed, by, their, ejecta, is, much, smaller, a, consequence, of, mercury, s, stronger, surface, gravity, according, to, international, astronomical, union, rules, each, new, crater, must, be, named, after, an, artist, who, was, famous, for, more, than, fifty, years, and, dead, for, more, than, three, years, before, the, date, the, crater, is, named, the, largest, known, crater, is, caloris, planitia, or, caloris, basin, with, a, diameter, of, 1, 550, km, 960, mi, the, impact, that, created, the, caloris, basin, was, so, powerful, that, it, caused, lava, eruptions, and, left, a, concentric, mountainous, ring, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, tall, surrounding, the, impact, crater, the, floor, of, the, caloris, basin, is, filled, by, a, geologically, distinct, flat, plain, broken, up, by, ridges, and, fractures, in, a, roughly, polygonal, pattern, it, is, not, clear, whether, they, were, volcanic, lava, flows, induced, by, the, impact, or, a, large, sheet, of, impact, melt, at, the, antipode, of, the, caloris, basin, is, a, large, region, of, unusual, hilly, terrain, known, as, the, weird, terrain, one, hypothesis, for, its, origin, is, that, shock, waves, generated, during, the, caloris, impact, traveled, around, mercury, converging, at, the, basin, s, antipode, 180, degrees, away, the, resulting, high, stresses, fractured, the, surface, alternatively, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, terrain, formed, as, a, result, of, the, convergence, of, ejecta, at, this, basin, s, antipode, overall, 46, impact, basins, have, been, identified, a, notable, basin, is, the, 400, km, 250, mi, wide, multi, ring, tolstoj, basin, that, has, an, ejecta, blanket, extending, up, to, 500, km, 310, mi, from, its, rim, and, a, floor, that, has, been, filled, by, smooth, plains, materials, beethoven, basin, has, a, similar, sized, ejecta, blanket, and, a, 625, km, 388, mi, diameter, rim, like, the, moon, the, surface, of, mercury, has, likely, incurred, the, effects, of, space, weathering, processes, including, solar, wind, and, micrometeorite, impacts, there, are, two, geologically, distinct, plains, regions, on, mercury, gently, rolling, hilly, plains, in, the, regions, between, craters, are, mercury, s, oldest, visible, surfaces, predating, the, heavily, cratered, terrain, these, inter, crater, plains, appear, to, have, obliterated, many, earlier, craters, and, show, a, general, paucity, of, smaller, craters, below, about, 30, km, 19, mi, in, diameter, smooth, plains, are, widespread, flat, areas, that, fill, depressions, of, various, sizes, and, bear, a, strong, resemblance, to, lunar, maria, unlike, lunar, maria, the, smooth, plains, of, mercury, have, the, same, albedo, as, the, older, inter, crater, plains, despite, a, lack, of, unequivocally, volcanic, characteristics, the, localization, and, rounded, lobate, shape, of, these, plains, strongly, support, volcanic, origins, all, the, smooth, plains, of, mercury, formed, significantly, later, than, the, caloris, basin, as, evidenced, by, appreciably, smaller, crater, densities, than, on, the, caloris, ejecta, blanket, an, unusual, feature, of, mercury, s, surface, is, the, numerous, compression, folds, or, rupes, that, crisscross, the, plains, these, exist, on, the, moon, but, are, much, more, prominent, on, mercury, as, mercury, s, interior, cooled, it, contracted, and, its, surface, began, to, deform, creating, wrinkle, ridges, and, lobate, scarps, associated, with, thrust, faults, the, scarps, can, reach, lengths, of, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, and, heights, of, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, these, compressional, features, can, be, seen, on, top, of, other, features, such, as, craters, and, smooth, plains, indicating, they, are, more, recent, mapping, of, the, features, has, suggested, a, total, shrinkage, of, mercury, s, radius, in, the, range, of, 1, 7, km, 0, 62, 4, 35, mi, most, activity, along, the, major, thrust, systems, probably, ended, about, 3, 6, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, small, scale, thrust, fault, scarps, have, been, found, tens, of, meters, in, height, and, with, lengths, in, the, range, of, a, few, kilometers, that, appear, to, be, less, than, 50, million, years, old, indicating, that, compression, of, the, interior, and, consequent, surface, geological, activity, continue, to, the, present, there, is, evidence, for, pyroclastic, flows, on, mercury, from, low, profile, shield, volcanoes, fifty, one, pyroclastic, deposits, have, been, identified, where, 90, of, them, are, found, within, impact, craters, a, study, of, the, degradation, state, of, the, impact, craters, that, host, pyroclastic, deposits, suggests, that, pyroclastic, activity, occurred, on, mercury, over, a, prolonged, interval, a, rimless, depression, inside, the, southwest, rim, of, the, caloris, basin, consists, of, at, least, nine, overlapping, volcanic, vents, each, individually, up, to, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, in, diameter, it, is, thus, a, compound, volcano, the, vent, floors, are, at, least, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, below, their, brinks, and, they, bear, a, closer, resemblance, to, volcanic, craters, sculpted, by, explosive, eruptions, or, modified, by, collapse, into, void, spaces, created, by, magma, withdrawal, back, down, into, a, conduit, scientists, could, not, quantify, the, age, of, the, volcanic, complex, system, but, reported, that, it, could, be, on, the, order, of, a, billion, years, the, surface, temperature, of, mercury, ranges, from, 100, to, 700, k, 173, to, 427, c, 280, to, 800, f, it, never, rises, above, 180, k, at, the, poles, due, to, the, absence, of, an, atmosphere, and, a, steep, temperature, gradient, between, the, equator, and, the, poles, at, perihelion, the, equatorial, subsolar, point, is, located, at, latitude, 0, w, or, 180, w, and, it, climbs, to, a, temperature, of, about, 700, k, during, aphelion, this, occurs, at, 90, or, 270, w, and, reaches, only, 550, k, on, the, dark, side, of, the, planet, temperatures, average, 110, k, the, intensity, of, sunlight, on, mercury, s, surface, ranges, between, 4, 59, and, 10, 61, times, the, solar, constant, 1, 370, w, m, 2, although, daylight, temperatures, at, the, surface, of, mercury, are, generally, extremely, high, observations, strongly, suggest, that, ice, frozen, water, exists, on, mercury, the, floors, of, deep, craters, at, the, poles, are, never, exposed, to, direct, sunlight, and, temperatures, there, remain, below, 102, k, far, lower, than, the, global, average, this, creates, a, cold, trap, where, ice, can, accumulate, water, ice, strongly, reflects, radar, and, observations, by, the, 70, meter, goldstone, solar, system, radar, and, the, vla, in, the, early, 1990s, revealed, that, there, are, patches, of, high, radar, reflection, near, the, poles, although, ice, was, not, the, only, possible, cause, of, these, reflective, regions, astronomers, thought, it, to, be, the, most, likely, explanation, the, presence, of, water, ice, was, confirmed, using, messenger, images, of, craters, at, the, north, pole, the, icy, crater, regions, are, estimated, to, contain, about, 10, 14, 10, 15, kg, of, ice, and, may, be, covered, by, a, layer, of, regolith, that, inhibits, sublimation, by, comparison, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, on, earth, has, a, mass, of, about, 4, 10, 18, kg, and, mars, s, south, polar, cap, contains, about, 10, 16, kg, of, water, the, origin, of, the, ice, on, mercury, is, not, yet, known, but, the, two, most, likely, sources, are, from, outgassing, of, water, from, the, planet, s, interior, and, deposition, by, impacts, of, comets, mercury, is, too, small, and, hot, for, its, gravity, to, retain, any, significant, atmosphere, over, long, periods, of, time, it, does, have, a, tenuous, surface, bounded, exosphere, at, a, surface, pressure, of, less, than, approximately, 0, 5, npa, 0, 005, picobars, it, includes, hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, silicon, and, hydroxide, among, others, this, exosphere, is, not, stable, atoms, are, continuously, lost, and, replenished, from, a, variety, of, sources, hydrogen, atoms, and, helium, atoms, probably, come, from, the, solar, wind, diffusing, into, mercury, s, magnetosphere, before, later, escaping, back, into, space, the, radioactive, decay, of, elements, within, mercury, s, crust, is, another, source, of, helium, as, well, as, sodium, and, potassium, water, vapor, is, present, released, by, a, combination, of, processes, such, as, comets, striking, its, surface, sputtering, creating, water, out, of, hydrogen, from, the, solar, wind, and, oxygen, from, rock, and, sublimation, from, reservoirs, of, water, ice, in, the, permanently, shadowed, polar, craters, the, detection, of, high, amounts, of, water, related, ions, like, o, oh, and, h, 3, o, was, a, surprise, because, of, the, quantities, of, these, ions, that, were, detected, in, mercury, s, space, environment, scientists, surmise, that, these, molecules, were, blasted, from, the, surface, or, exosphere, by, the, solar, wind, sodium, potassium, and, calcium, were, discovered, in, the, atmosphere, during, the, 1980s, 1990s, and, are, thought, to, result, primarily, from, the, vaporization, of, surface, rock, struck, by, micrometeorite, impacts, including, presently, from, comet, encke, in, 2008, magnesium, was, discovered, by, messenger, studies, indicate, that, at, times, sodium, emissions, are, localized, at, points, that, correspond, to, the, planet, s, magnetic, poles, this, would, indicate, an, interaction, between, the, magnetosphere, and, the, planet, s, surface, according, to, nasa, mercury, is, not, a, suitable, planet, for, earth, like, life, it, has, a, surface, boundary, exosphere, instead, of, a, layered, atmosphere, extreme, temperatures, and, high, solar, radiation, it, is, unlikely, that, any, living, beings, can, withstand, those, conditions, some, parts, of, the, subsurface, of, mercury, may, have, been, habitable, and, perhaps, life, forms, albeit, likely, primitive, microorganisms, may, have, existed, on, the, planet, despite, its, small, size, and, slow, 59, day, long, rotation, mercury, has, a, significant, and, apparently, global, magnetic, field, according, to, measurements, taken, by, mariner, 10, it, is, about, 1, 1, the, strength, of, earth, s, the, magnetic, field, strength, at, mercury, s, equator, is, about, 300, nt, like, that, of, earth, mercury, s, magnetic, field, is, dipolar, and, nearly, aligned, with, the, planet, s, spin, axis, 10, dipolar, tilt, compared, to, 11, for, earth, measurements, from, both, the, mariner, 10, and, messenger, space, probes, have, indicated, that, the, strength, and, shape, of, the, magnetic, field, are, stable, it, is, likely, that, this, magnetic, field, is, generated, by, a, dynamo, effect, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, magnetic, field, of, earth, this, dynamo, effect, would, result, from, the, circulation, of, the, planet, s, iron, rich, liquid, core, particularly, strong, tidal, heating, effects, caused, by, the, planet, s, high, orbital, eccentricity, would, serve, to, keep, part, of, the, core, in, the, liquid, state, necessary, for, this, dynamo, effect, mercury, s, magnetic, field, is, strong, enough, to, deflect, the, solar, wind, around, the, planet, creating, a, magnetosphere, the, planet, s, magnetosphere, though, small, enough, to, fit, within, earth, is, strong, enough, to, trap, solar, wind, plasma, this, contributes, to, the, space, weathering, of, the, planet, s, surface, observations, taken, by, the, mariner, 10, spacecraft, detected, this, low, energy, plasma, in, the, magnetosphere, of, the, planet, s, nightside, bursts, of, energetic, particles, in, the, planet, s, magnetotail, indicate, a, dynamic, quality, to, the, planet, s, magnetosphere, during, its, second, flyby, of, the, planet, on, october, 6, 2008, messenger, discovered, that, mercury, s, magnetic, field, can, be, extremely, leaky, the, spacecraft, encountered, magnetic, tornadoes, twisted, bundles, of, magnetic, fields, connecting, the, planetary, magnetic, field, to, interplanetary, space, that, were, up, to, 800, km, wide, or, a, third, of, the, radius, of, the, planet, these, twisted, magnetic, flux, tubes, technically, known, as, flux, transfer, events, form, open, windows, in, the, planet, s, magnetic, shield, through, which, the, solar, wind, may, enter, and, directly, impact, mercury, s, surface, via, magnetic, reconnection, this, also, occurs, in, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, messenger, observations, showed, the, reconnection, rate, was, ten, times, higher, at, mercury, but, its, proximity, to, the, sun, only, accounts, for, about, a, third, of, the, reconnection, rate, observed, by, messenger, mercury, has, the, most, eccentric, orbit, of, all, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, its, eccentricity, is, 0, 21, with, its, distance, from, the, sun, ranging, from, 46, 000, 000, to, 70, 000, 000, km, 29, 000, 000, to, 43, 000, 000, mi, it, takes, 87, 969, earth, days, to, complete, an, orbit, the, diagram, illustrates, the, effects, of, the, eccentricity, showing, mercury, s, orbit, overlaid, with, a, circular, orbit, having, the, same, semi, major, axis, mercury, s, higher, velocity, when, it, is, near, perihelion, is, clear, from, the, greater, distance, it, covers, in, each, 5, day, interval, in, the, diagram, the, varying, distance, of, mercury, to, the, sun, is, represented, by, the, size, of, the, planet, which, is, inversely, proportional, to, mercury, s, distance, from, the, sun, this, varying, distance, to, the, sun, leads, to, mercury, s, surface, being, flexed, by, tidal, bulges, raised, by, the, sun, that, are, about, 17, times, stronger, than, the, moon, s, on, earth, combined, with, a, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, of, the, planet, s, rotation, around, its, axis, it, also, results, in, complex, variations, of, the, surface, temperature, the, resonance, makes, a, single, solar, day, the, length, between, two, meridian, transits, of, the, sun, on, mercury, last, exactly, two, mercury, years, or, about, 176, earth, days, mercury, s, orbit, is, inclined, by, 7, degrees, to, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, the, ecliptic, the, largest, of, all, eight, known, solar, planets, as, a, result, transits, of, mercury, across, the, face, of, the, sun, can, only, occur, when, the, planet, is, crossing, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, at, the, time, it, lies, between, earth, and, the, sun, which, is, in, may, or, november, this, occurs, about, every, seven, years, on, average, mercury, s, axial, tilt, is, almost, zero, with, the, best, measured, value, as, low, as, 0, 027, degrees, this, is, significantly, smaller, than, that, of, jupiter, which, has, the, second, smallest, axial, tilt, of, all, planets, at, 3, 1, degrees, this, means, that, to, an, observer, at, mercury, s, poles, the, center, of, the, sun, never, rises, more, than, 2, 1, arcminutes, above, the, horizon, by, comparison, the, angular, size, of, the, sun, as, seen, from, mercury, ranges, from, 1, 1, 4, to, 2, degrees, across, at, certain, points, on, mercury, s, surface, an, observer, would, be, able, to, see, the, sun, peek, up, a, little, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, way, over, the, horizon, then, reverse, and, set, before, rising, again, all, within, the, same, mercurian, day, this, is, because, approximately, four, earth, days, before, perihelion, mercury, s, angular, orbital, velocity, equals, its, angular, rotational, velocity, so, that, the, sun, s, apparent, motion, ceases, closer, to, perihelion, mercury, s, angular, orbital, velocity, then, exceeds, the, angular, rotational, velocity, thus, to, a, hypothetical, observer, on, mercury, the, sun, appears, to, move, in, a, retrograde, direction, four, earth, days, after, perihelion, the, sun, s, normal, apparent, motion, resumes, a, similar, effect, would, have, occurred, if, mercury, had, been, in, synchronous, rotation, the, alternating, gain, and, loss, of, rotation, over, a, revolution, would, have, caused, a, libration, of, 23, 65, in, longitude, for, the, same, reason, there, are, two, points, on, mercury, s, equator, 180, degrees, apart, in, longitude, at, either, of, which, around, perihelion, in, alternate, mercurian, years, once, a, mercurian, day, the, sun, passes, overhead, then, reverses, its, apparent, motion, and, passes, overhead, again, then, reverses, a, second, time, and, passes, overhead, a, third, time, taking, a, total, of, about, 16, earth, days, for, this, entire, process, in, the, other, alternate, mercurian, years, the, same, thing, happens, at, the, other, of, these, two, points, the, amplitude, of, the, retrograde, motion, is, small, so, the, overall, effect, is, that, for, two, or, three, weeks, the, sun, is, almost, stationary, overhead, and, is, at, its, most, brilliant, because, mercury, is, at, perihelion, its, closest, to, the, sun, this, prolonged, exposure, to, the, sun, at, its, brightest, makes, these, two, points, the, hottest, places, on, mercury, maximum, temperature, occurs, when, the, sun, is, at, an, angle, of, about, 25, degrees, past, noon, due, to, diurnal, temperature, lag, at, 0, 4, mercury, days, and, 0, 8, mercury, years, past, sunrise, conversely, there, are, two, other, points, on, the, equator, 90, degrees, of, longitude, apart, from, the, first, ones, where, the, sun, passes, overhead, only, when, the, planet, is, at, aphelion, in, alternate, years, when, the, apparent, motion, of, the, sun, in, mercury, s, sky, is, relatively, rapid, these, points, which, are, the, ones, on, the, equator, where, the, apparent, retrograde, motion, of, the, sun, happens, when, it, is, crossing, the, horizon, as, described, in, the, preceding, paragraph, receive, much, less, solar, heat, than, the, first, ones, described, above, mercury, attains, an, inferior, conjunction, nearest, approach, to, earth, every, 116, earth, days, on, average, but, this, interval, can, range, from, 105, days, to, 129, days, due, to, the, planet, s, eccentric, orbit, mercury, can, come, as, near, as, 82, 200, 000, km, 0, 549, astronomical, units, 51, 1, million, miles, to, earth, and, that, is, slowly, declining, the, next, approach, to, within, 82, 100, 000, km, 51, million, mi, is, in, 2679, and, to, within, 82, 000, 000, km, 51, million, mi, in, 4487, but, it, will, not, be, closer, to, earth, than, 80, 000, 000, km, 50, million, mi, until, 28, 622, its, period, of, retrograde, motion, as, seen, from, earth, can, vary, from, 8, to, 15, days, on, either, side, of, an, inferior, conjunction, this, large, range, arises, from, the, planet, s, high, orbital, eccentricity, essentially, because, mercury, is, closest, to, the, sun, when, taking, an, average, over, time, mercury, is, most, often, the, closest, planet, to, the, earth, and, in, that, measure, it, is, the, closest, planet, to, each, of, the, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, the, longitude, convention, for, mercury, puts, the, zero, of, longitude, at, one, of, the, two, hottest, points, on, the, surface, as, described, above, however, when, this, area, was, first, visited, by, mariner, 10, this, zero, meridian, was, in, darkness, so, it, was, impossible, to, select, a, feature, on, the, surface, to, define, the, exact, position, of, the, meridian, therefore, a, small, crater, further, west, was, chosen, called, hun, kal, which, provides, the, exact, reference, point, for, measuring, longitude, the, center, of, hun, kal, defines, the, 20, west, meridian, a, 1970, international, astronomical, union, resolution, suggests, that, longitudes, be, measured, positively, in, the, westerly, direction, on, mercury, the, two, hottest, places, on, the, equator, are, therefore, at, longitudes, 0, w, and, 180, w, and, the, coolest, points, on, the, equator, are, at, longitudes, 90, w, and, 270, w, however, the, messenger, project, uses, an, east, positive, convention, for, many, years, it, was, thought, that, mercury, was, synchronously, tidally, locked, with, the, sun, rotating, once, for, each, orbit, and, always, keeping, the, same, face, directed, towards, the, sun, in, the, same, way, that, the, same, side, of, the, moon, always, faces, earth, radar, observations, in, 1965, proved, that, the, planet, has, a, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, rotating, three, times, for, every, two, revolutions, around, the, sun, the, eccentricity, of, mercury, s, orbit, makes, this, resonance, stable, at, perihelion, when, the, solar, tide, is, strongest, the, sun, is, nearly, stationary, in, mercury, s, sky, the, 3, 2, resonant, tidal, locking, is, stabilized, by, the, variance, of, the, tidal, force, along, mercury, s, eccentric, orbit, acting, on, a, permanent, dipole, component, of, mercury, s, mass, distribution, in, a, circular, orbit, there, is, no, such, variance, so, the, only, resonance, stabilized, in, such, an, orbit, is, at, 1, 1, e, g, earth, moon, when, the, tidal, force, stretching, a, body, along, the, center, body, line, exerts, a, torque, that, aligns, the, body, s, axis, of, least, inertia, the, longest, axis, and, the, axis, of, the, aforementioned, dipole, to, always, point, at, the, center, however, with, noticeable, eccentricity, like, that, of, mercury, s, orbit, the, tidal, force, has, a, maximum, at, perihelion, and, therefore, stabilizes, resonances, like, 3, 2, ensuring, that, the, planet, points, its, axis, of, least, inertia, roughly, at, the, sun, when, passing, through, perihelion, the, original, reason, astronomers, thought, it, was, synchronously, locked, was, that, whenever, mercury, was, best, placed, for, observation, it, was, always, nearly, at, the, same, point, in, its, 3, 2, resonance, hence, showing, the, same, face, this, is, because, coincidentally, mercury, s, rotation, period, is, almost, exactly, half, of, its, synodic, period, with, respect, to, earth, due, to, mercury, s, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, a, solar, day, lasts, about, 176, earth, days, a, sidereal, day, the, period, of, rotation, lasts, about, 58, 7, earth, days, simulations, indicate, that, the, orbital, eccentricity, of, mercury, varies, chaotically, from, nearly, zero, circular, to, more, than, 0, 45, over, millions, of, years, due, to, perturbations, from, the, other, planets, this, was, thought, to, explain, mercury, s, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, rather, than, the, more, usual, 1, 1, because, this, state, is, more, likely, to, arise, during, a, period, of, high, eccentricity, however, accurate, modeling, based, on, a, realistic, model, of, tidal, response, has, demonstrated, that, mercury, was, captured, into, the, 3, 2, spin, orbit, state, at, a, very, early, stage, of, its, history, within, 20, more, likely, 10, million, years, after, its, formation, numerical, simulations, show, that, a, future, secular, orbital, resonant, interaction, with, the, perihelion, of, jupiter, may, cause, the, eccentricity, of, mercury, s, orbit, to, increase, to, the, point, where, there, is, a, 1, chance, that, the, orbit, will, be, destabilized, in, the, next, five, billion, years, if, this, happens, mercury, may, fall, into, the, sun, collide, with, venus, be, ejected, from, the, solar, system, or, even, disrupt, the, rest, of, the, inner, solar, system, in, 1859, the, french, mathematician, and, astronomer, urbain, le, verrier, reported, that, the, slow, precession, of, mercury, s, orbit, around, the, sun, could, not, be, completely, explained, by, newtonian, mechanics, and, perturbations, by, the, known, planets, he, suggested, among, possible, explanations, that, another, planet, or, perhaps, instead, a, series, of, smaller, corpuscules, might, exist, in, an, orbit, even, closer, to, the, sun, than, that, of, mercury, to, account, for, this, perturbation, other, explanations, considered, included, a, slight, oblateness, of, the, sun, the, success, of, the, search, for, neptune, based, on, its, perturbations, of, the, orbit, of, uranus, led, astronomers, to, place, faith, in, this, possible, explanation, and, the, hypothetical, planet, was, named, vulcan, but, no, such, planet, was, ever, found, the, observed, perihelion, precession, of, mercury, is, 5, 600, arcseconds, 1, 5556, per, century, relative, to, earth, or, 574, 10, 0, 65, arcseconds, per, century, relative, to, the, inertial, icrf, newtonian, mechanics, taking, into, account, all, the, effects, from, the, other, planets, and, including, 0, 0254, arcseconds, per, century, due, to, the, oblateness, of, the, sun, predicts, a, precession, of, 5, 557, arcseconds, 1, 5436, per, century, relative, to, earth, or, 531, 63, 0, 69, arcseconds, per, century, relative, to, icrf, in, the, early, 20th, century, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, provided, the, explanation, for, the, observed, precession, by, formalizing, gravitation, as, being, mediated, by, the, curvature, of, spacetime, the, effect, is, small, just, 42, 980, 0, 001, arcseconds, per, century, or, 0, 43, arcsecond, per, year, or, 0, 1035, arcsecond, per, orbital, period, for, mercury, it, therefore, requires, a, little, over, 12, 5, million, orbits, or, 3, million, years, for, a, full, excess, turn, similar, but, much, smaller, effects, exist, for, other, solar, system, bodies, 8, 6247, arcseconds, per, century, for, venus, 3, 8387, for, earth, 1, 351, for, mars, and, 10, 05, for, 1566, icarus, mercury, s, apparent, magnitude, is, calculated, to, vary, between, 2, 48, brighter, than, sirius, around, superior, conjunction, and, 7, 25, below, the, limit, of, naked, eye, visibility, around, inferior, conjunction, the, mean, apparent, magnitude, is, 0, 23, while, the, standard, deviation, of, 1, 78, is, the, largest, of, any, planet, the, mean, apparent, magnitude, at, superior, conjunction, is, 1, 89, while, that, at, inferior, conjunction, is, 5, 93, observation, of, mercury, is, complicated, by, its, proximity, to, the, sun, as, it, is, lost, in, the, sun, s, glare, for, much, of, the, time, mercury, can, be, observed, for, only, a, brief, period, during, either, morning, or, evening, twilight, ground, based, telescope, observations, of, mercury, reveal, only, an, illuminated, partial, disk, with, limited, detail, the, hubble, space, telescope, cannot, observe, mercury, at, all, due, to, safety, procedures, that, prevent, its, pointing, too, close, to, the, sun, because, the, shift, of, 0, 15, revolutions, of, earth, in, a, mercurian, year, makes, up, a, seven, mercurian, year, cycle, 0, 15, 7, 1, 0, in, the, seventh, mercurian, year, mercury, follows, almost, exactly, earlier, by, 7, days, the, sequence, of, phenomena, it, showed, seven, mercurian, years, before, like, the, moon, and, venus, mercury, exhibits, phases, as, seen, from, earth, it, is, new, at, inferior, conjunction, and, full, at, superior, conjunction, the, planet, is, rendered, invisible, from, earth, on, both, of, these, occasions, because, of, its, being, obscured, by, the, sun, except, at, its, new, phase, during, a, transit, mercury, is, technically, brightest, as, seen, from, earth, when, it, is, at, a, full, phase, although, mercury, is, farthest, from, earth, when, it, is, full, the, greater, illuminated, area, that, is, visible, and, the, opposition, brightness, surge, more, than, compensates, for, the, distance, the, opposite, is, true, for, venus, which, appears, brightest, when, it, is, a, crescent, because, it, is, much, closer, to, earth, than, when, gibbous, mercury, is, best, observed, at, the, first, and, last, quarter, although, they, are, phases, of, lesser, brightness, the, first, and, last, quarter, phases, occur, at, greatest, elongation, east, and, west, of, the, sun, respectively, at, both, of, these, times, mercury, s, separation, from, the, sun, ranges, anywhere, from, 17, 9, at, perihelion, to, 27, 8, at, aphelion, at, greatest, western, elongation, mercury, rises, at, its, earliest, before, sunrise, and, at, greatest, eastern, elongation, it, sets, at, its, latest, after, sunset, mercury, is, more, often, and, easily, visible, from, the, southern, hemisphere, than, from, the, northern, this, is, because, mercury, s, maximum, western, elongation, occurs, only, during, early, autumn, in, the, southern, hemisphere, whereas, its, greatest, eastern, elongation, happens, only, during, late, winter, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, both, of, these, cases, the, angle, at, which, the, planet, s, orbit, intersects, the, horizon, is, maximized, allowing, it, to, rise, several, hours, before, sunrise, in, the, former, instance, and, not, set, until, several, hours, after, sundown, in, the, latter, from, southern, mid, latitudes, such, as, argentina, and, south, africa, an, alternate, method, for, viewing, mercury, involves, observing, the, planet, with, a, telescope, during, daylight, hours, when, conditions, are, clear, ideally, when, it, is, at, its, greatest, elongation, this, allows, the, planet, to, be, found, easily, even, when, using, telescopes, with, 8, cm, 3, 1, in, apertures, however, great, care, must, be, taken, to, obstruct, the, sun, from, sight, because, of, the, extreme, risk, for, eye, damage, this, method, bypasses, the, limitation, of, twilight, observing, when, the, ecliptic, is, located, at, a, low, elevation, e, g, on, autumn, evenings, the, planet, is, higher, in, the, sky, and, less, atmospheric, effects, affect, the, view, of, the, planet, mercury, can, be, viewed, as, close, as, 4, to, the, sun, near, superior, conjunction, when, it, is, almost, at, its, brightest, mercury, can, like, several, other, planets, and, the, brightest, stars, be, seen, during, a, total, solar, eclipse, the, earliest, known, recorded, observations, of, mercury, are, from, the, mul, apin, tablets, these, observations, were, most, likely, made, by, an, assyrian, astronomer, around, the, 14th, century, bc, the, cuneiform, name, used, to, designate, mercury, on, the, mul, apin, tablets, is, transcribed, as, udu, idim, gu, u, 4, ud, the, jumping, planet, babylonian, records, of, mercury, date, back, to, the, 1st, millennium, bc, the, babylonians, called, the, planet, nabu, after, the, messenger, to, the, gods, in, their, mythology, the, greco, egyptian, astronomer, ptolemy, wrote, about, the, possibility, of, planetary, transits, across, the, face, of, the, sun, in, his, work, planetary, hypotheses, he, suggested, that, no, transits, had, been, observed, either, because, planets, such, as, mercury, were, too, small, to, see, or, because, transits, were, too, infrequent, in, ancient, china, mercury, was, known, as, the, hour, star, chen, xing, it, was, associated, with, the, direction, north, and, the, phase, of, water, in, the, five, phases, system, of, metaphysics, modern, chinese, korean, japanese, and, vietnamese, cultures, refer, to, the, planet, literally, as, the, water, star, based, on, the, five, elements, hindu, mythology, used, the, name, budha, for, mercury, and, this, god, was, thought, to, preside, over, wednesday, the, god, odin, or, woden, of, germanic, paganism, was, associated, with, the, planet, mercury, and, wednesday, the, maya, may, have, represented, mercury, as, an, owl, or, possibly, four, owls, two, for, the, morning, aspect, and, two, for, the, evening, that, served, as, a, messenger, to, the, underworld, in, medieval, islamic, astronomy, the, andalusian, astronomer, ab, ish, q, ibr, h, m, al, zarq, l, in, the, 11th, century, described, the, deferent, of, mercury, s, geocentric, orbit, as, being, oval, like, an, egg, or, a, pignon, although, this, insight, did, not, influence, his, astronomical, theory, or, his, astronomical, calculations, in, the, 12th, century, ibn, bajjah, observed, two, planets, as, black, spots, on, the, face, of, the, sun, which, was, later, suggested, as, the, transit, of, mercury, and, or, venus, by, the, maragha, astronomer, qotb, al, din, shirazi, in, the, 13th, century, most, such, medieval, reports, of, transits, were, later, taken, as, observations, of, sunspots, in, india, the, kerala, school, astronomer, nilakantha, somayaji, in, the, 15th, century, developed, a, partially, heliocentric, planetary, model, in, which, mercury, orbits, the, sun, which, in, turn, orbits, earth, similar, to, the, tychonic, system, later, proposed, by, tycho, brahe, in, the, late, 16th, century, the, first, telescopic, observations, of, mercury, were, made, by, thomas, harriot, and, galileo, from, 1610, in, 1612, simon, marius, observed, the, brightness, of, mercury, varied, with, the, planet, s, orbital, position, and, concluded, it, had, phases, in, the, same, way, as, venus, and, the, moon, in, 1631, pierre, gassendi, made, the, first, telescopic, observations, of, the, transit, of, a, planet, across, the, sun, when, he, saw, a, transit, of, mercury, predicted, by, johannes, kepler, in, 1639, giovanni, zupi, used, a, telescope, to, discover, that, the, planet, had, orbital, phases, similar, to, venus, and, the, moon, the, observation, demonstrated, conclusively, that, mercury, orbited, the, sun, a, rare, event, in, astronomy, is, the, passage, of, one, planet, in, front, of, another, occultation, as, seen, from, earth, mercury, and, venus, occult, each, other, every, few, centuries, and, the, event, of, may, 28, 1737, is, the, only, one, historically, observed, having, been, seen, by, john, bevis, at, the, royal, greenwich, observatory, the, next, occultation, of, mercury, by, venus, will, be, on, december, 3, 2133, the, difficulties, inherent, in, observing, mercury, meant, that, it, was, far, less, studied, than, the, other, planets, in, 1800, johann, schr, ter, made, observations, of, surface, features, claiming, to, have, observed, 20, kilometre, high, 12, mi, mountains, friedrich, bessel, used, schr, ter, s, drawings, to, erroneously, estimate, the, rotation, period, as, 24, hours, and, an, axial, tilt, of, 70, in, the, 1880s, giovanni, schiaparelli, mapped, the, planet, more, accurately, and, suggested, that, mercury, s, rotational, period, was, 88, days, the, same, as, its, orbital, period, due, to, tidal, locking, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, synchronous, rotation, the, effort, to, map, the, surface, of, mercury, was, continued, by, eugenios, antoniadi, who, published, a, book, in, 1934, that, included, both, maps, and, his, own, observations, many, of, the, planet, s, surface, features, particularly, the, albedo, features, take, their, names, from, antoniadi, s, map, in, june, 1962, soviet, scientists, at, the, institute, of, radio, engineering, and, electronics, of, the, ussr, academy, of, sciences, led, by, vladimir, kotelnikov, became, the, first, to, bounce, a, radar, signal, off, mercury, and, receive, it, starting, radar, observations, of, the, planet, three, years, later, radar, observations, by, americans, gordon, h, pettengill, and, rolf, b, dyce, using, the, 300, metre, wide, 330, yd, arecibo, radio, telescope, in, puerto, rico, showed, conclusively, that, the, planet, s, rotational, period, was, about, 59, days, the, theory, that, mercury, s, rotation, was, synchronous, had, become, widely, held, and, it, was, a, surprise, to, astronomers, when, these, radio, observations, were, announced, if, mercury, were, tidally, locked, its, dark, face, would, be, extremely, cold, but, measurements, of, radio, emission, revealed, that, it, was, much, hotter, than, expected, astronomers, were, reluctant, to, drop, the, synchronous, rotation, theory, and, proposed, alternative, mechanisms, such, as, powerful, heat, distributing, winds, to, explain, the, observations, in, 1965, italian, astronomer, giuseppe, colombo, noted, that, the, rotation, value, was, about, two, thirds, of, mercury, s, orbital, period, and, proposed, that, the, planet, s, orbital, and, rotational, periods, were, locked, into, a, 3, 2, rather, than, a, 1, 1, resonance, data, from, mariner, 10, subsequently, confirmed, this, view, this, means, that, schiaparelli, s, and, antoniadi, s, maps, were, not, wrong, instead, the, astronomers, saw, the, same, features, during, every, second, orbit, and, recorded, them, but, disregarded, those, seen, in, the, meantime, when, mercury, s, other, face, was, toward, the, sun, because, the, orbital, geometry, meant, that, these, observations, were, made, under, poor, viewing, conditions, ground, based, optical, observations, did, not, shed, much, further, light, on, mercury, but, radio, astronomers, using, interferometry, at, microwave, wavelengths, a, technique, that, enables, removal, of, the, solar, radiation, were, able, to, discern, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, of, the, subsurface, layers, to, a, depth, of, several, meters, not, until, the, first, space, probe, flew, past, mercury, did, many, of, its, most, fundamental, morphological, properties, become, known, moreover, technological, advances, have, led, to, improved, ground, based, observations, in, 2000, high, resolution, lucky, imaging, observations, were, conducted, by, the, mount, wilson, observatory, 1, 5, metre, 4, 9, ft, hale, telescope, they, provided, the, first, views, that, resolved, surface, features, on, the, parts, of, mercury, that, were, not, imaged, in, the, mariner, 10, mission, most, of, the, planet, has, been, mapped, by, the, arecibo, radar, telescope, with, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, resolution, including, polar, deposits, in, shadowed, craters, of, what, may, be, water, ice, reaching, mercury, from, earth, poses, significant, technical, challenges, because, it, orbits, so, much, closer, to, the, sun, than, earth, a, mercury, bound, spacecraft, launched, from, earth, must, travel, over, 91, million, kilometres, 57, million, miles, into, the, sun, s, gravitational, potential, well, mercury, has, an, orbital, speed, of, 47, 4, km, s, 29, 5, mi, s, whereas, earth, s, orbital, speed, is, 29, 8, km, s, 18, 5, mi, s, therefore, the, spacecraft, must, make, a, larger, change, in, velocity, delta, v, to, get, to, mercury, and, then, enter, orbit, as, compared, to, the, delta, v, required, for, say, mars, planetary, missions, the, potential, energy, liberated, by, moving, down, the, sun, s, potential, well, becomes, kinetic, energy, requiring, a, delta, v, change, to, do, anything, other, than, pass, by, mercury, some, portion, of, this, delta, v, budget, can, be, provided, from, a, gravity, assist, during, one, or, more, fly, bys, of, venus, to, land, safely, or, enter, a, stable, orbit, the, spacecraft, would, rely, entirely, on, rocket, motors, aerobraking, is, ruled, out, because, mercury, has, a, negligible, atmosphere, a, trip, to, mercury, requires, more, rocket, fuel, than, that, required, to, escape, the, solar, system, completely, as, a, result, only, three, space, probes, have, visited, it, so, far, a, proposed, alternative, approach, would, use, a, solar, sail, to, attain, a, mercury, synchronous, orbit, around, the, sun, the, first, spacecraft, to, visit, mercury, was, nasa, s, mariner, 10, 1974, 1975, the, spacecraft, used, the, gravity, of, venus, to, adjust, its, orbital, velocity, so, that, it, could, approach, mercury, making, it, both, the, first, spacecraft, to, use, this, gravitational, slingshot, effect, and, the, first, nasa, mission, to, visit, multiple, planets, mariner, 10, provided, the, first, close, up, images, of, mercury, s, surface, which, immediately, showed, its, heavily, cratered, nature, and, revealed, many, other, types, of, geological, features, such, as, the, giant, scarps, that, were, later, ascribed, to, the, effect, of, the, planet, shrinking, slightly, as, its, iron, core, cools, unfortunately, the, same, face, of, the, planet, was, lit, at, each, of, mariner, 10, s, close, approaches, this, made, close, observation, of, both, sides, of, the, planet, impossible, and, resulted, in, the, mapping, of, less, than, 45, of, the, planet, s, surface, the, spacecraft, made, three, close, approaches, to, mercury, the, closest, of, which, took, it, to, within, 327, km, 203, mi, of, the, surface, at, the, first, close, approach, instruments, detected, a, magnetic, field, to, the, great, surprise, of, planetary, geologists, mercury, s, rotation, was, expected, to, be, much, too, slow, to, generate, a, significant, dynamo, effect, the, second, close, approach, was, primarily, used, for, imaging, but, at, the, third, approach, extensive, magnetic, data, were, obtained, the, data, revealed, that, the, planet, s, magnetic, field, is, much, like, earth, s, which, deflects, the, solar, wind, around, the, planet, for, many, years, after, the, mariner, 10, encounters, the, origin, of, mercury, s, magnetic, field, remained, the, subject, of, several, competing, theories, on, march, 24, 1975, just, eight, days, after, its, final, close, approach, mariner, 10, ran, out, of, fuel, because, its, orbit, could, no, longer, be, accurately, controlled, mission, controllers, instructed, the, probe, to, shut, down, mariner, 10, is, thought, to, be, still, orbiting, the, sun, passing, close, to, mercury, every, few, months, a, second, nasa, mission, to, mercury, named, messenger, mercury, surface, space, environment, geochemistry, and, ranging, was, launched, on, august, 3, 2004, it, made, a, fly, by, of, earth, in, august, 2005, and, of, venus, in, october, 2006, and, june, 2007, to, place, it, onto, the, correct, trajectory, to, reach, an, orbit, around, mercury, a, first, fly, by, of, mercury, occurred, on, january, 14, 2008, a, second, on, october, 6, 2008, and, a, third, on, september, 29, 2009, most, of, the, hemisphere, not, imaged, by, mariner, 10, was, mapped, during, these, fly, bys, the, probe, successfully, entered, an, elliptical, orbit, around, the, planet, on, march, 18, 2011, the, first, orbital, image, of, mercury, was, obtained, on, march, 29, 2011, the, probe, finished, a, one, year, mapping, mission, and, then, entered, a, one, year, extended, mission, into, 2013, in, addition, to, continued, observations, and, mapping, of, mercury, messenger, observed, the, 2012, solar, maximum, the, mission, was, designed, to, clear, up, six, key, issues, mercury, s, high, density, its, geological, history, the, nature, of, its, magnetic, field, the, structure, of, its, core, whether, it, has, ice, at, its, poles, and, where, its, tenuous, atmosphere, comes, from, to, this, end, the, probe, carried, imaging, devices, that, gathered, much, higher, resolution, images, of, much, more, of, mercury, than, mariner, 10, assorted, spectrometers, to, determine, the, abundances, of, elements, in, the, crust, and, magnetometers, and, devices, to, measure, velocities, of, charged, particles, measurements, of, changes, in, the, probe, s, orbital, velocity, were, expected, to, be, used, to, infer, details, of, the, planet, s, interior, structure, messenger, s, final, maneuver, was, on, april, 24, 2015, and, it, crashed, into, mercury, s, surface, on, april, 30, 2015, the, spacecraft, s, impact, with, mercury, occurred, at, 3, 26, 01, p, m, edt, on, april, 30, 2015, leaving, a, crater, estimated, to, be, 16, m, 52, ft, in, diameter, the, european, space, agency, and, the, japanese, space, agency, developed, and, launched, a, joint, mission, called, bepicolombo, which, will, orbit, mercury, with, two, probes, one, to, map, the, planet, and, the, other, to, study, its, magnetosphere, launched, on, october, 20, 2018, bepicolombo, is, expected, to, reach, mercury, in, 2025, it, will, release, a, magnetometer, probe, into, an, elliptical, orbit, then, chemical, rockets, will, fire, to, deposit, the, mapper, probe, into, a, circular, orbit, both, probes, will, operate, for, one, terrestrial, year, the, mapper, probe, carries, an, array, of, spectrometers, similar, to, those, on, messenger, and, will, study, the, planet, at, many, different, wavelengths, including, infrared, ultraviolet, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, bepicolombo, conducted, three, of, its, six, planned, mercury, flybys, from, october, 1, 2021, to, june, 19, 2023, on, march, 5, 2024, nasa, released,
