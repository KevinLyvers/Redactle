https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet
halley, s, comet, is, the, only, known, short, period, comet, that, is, consistently, visible, to, the, naked, eye, from, earth, appearing, every, 72, 80, years, it, last, appeared, in, the, inner, parts, of, the, solar, system, in, 1986, and, will, next, appear, in, mid, 2061, officially, designated, 1p, halley, it, is, also, commonly, called, comet, halley, or, sometimes, simply, halley, halley, s, periodic, returns, to, the, inner, solar, system, have, been, observed, and, recorded, by, astronomers, around, the, world, since, at, least, 240, bc, but, it, was, not, until, 1705, that, the, english, astronomer, edmond, halley, understood, that, these, appearances, were, re, appearances, of, the, same, comet, as, a, result, of, this, discovery, the, comet, is, named, after, halley, during, its, 1986, visit, to, the, inner, solar, system, halley, s, comet, became, the, first, comet, to, be, observed, in, detail, by, spacecraft, providing, the, first, observational, data, on, the, structure, of, a, comet, nucleus, and, the, mechanism, of, coma, and, tail, formation, these, observations, supported, a, number, of, longstanding, hypotheses, about, comet, construction, particularly, fred, whipple, s, dirty, snowball, model, which, correctly, predicted, that, halley, would, be, composed, of, a, mixture, of, volatile, ices, such, as, water, carbon, dioxide, ammonia, and, dust, the, missions, also, provided, data, that, substantially, reformed, and, reconfigured, these, ideas, for, instance, it, is, now, understood, that, the, surface, of, halley, is, largely, composed, of, dusty, non, volatile, materials, and, that, only, a, small, portion, of, it, is, icy, comet, halley, is, usually, pronounced, h, l, i, rhyming, with, valley, or, sometimes, h, e, l, i, rhyming, with, daily, as, to, the, surname, halley, colin, ronan, one, of, edmond, halley, s, biographers, preferred, h, l, i, rhyming, with, crawly, spellings, of, halley, s, name, during, his, lifetime, included, hailey, haley, hayley, halley, hawley, and, hawly, so, its, contemporary, pronunciation, is, uncertain, but, the, version, rhyming, with, valley, seems, to, be, preferred, by, current, bearers, of, the, surname, halley, was, the, first, comet, to, be, recognised, as, periodic, until, the, renaissance, the, philosophical, consensus, on, the, nature, of, comets, promoted, by, aristotle, was, that, they, were, disturbances, in, earth, s, atmosphere, this, idea, was, disproven, in, 1577, by, tycho, brahe, who, used, parallax, measurements, to, show, that, comets, must, lie, beyond, the, moon, many, were, still, unconvinced, that, comets, orbited, the, sun, and, assumed, instead, that, they, must, follow, straight, paths, through, the, solar, system, in, 1687, sir, isaac, newton, published, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, in, which, he, outlined, his, laws, of, gravity, and, motion, his, work, on, comets, was, decidedly, incomplete, although, he, had, suspected, that, two, comets, that, had, appeared, in, succession, in, 1680, and, 1681, were, the, same, comet, before, and, after, passing, behind, the, sun, he, was, later, found, to, be, correct, see, newton, s, comet, he, was, initially, unable, to, completely, reconcile, comets, into, his, model, ultimately, it, was, newton, s, friend, editor, and, publisher, edmond, halley, who, in, his, 1705, synopsis, of, the, astronomy, of, comets, used, newton, s, new, laws, to, calculate, the, gravitational, effects, of, jupiter, and, saturn, on, cometary, orbits, having, compiled, a, list, of, 24, comet, observations, he, calculated, that, the, orbital, elements, of, a, second, comet, that, had, appeared, in, 1682, were, nearly, the, same, as, those, of, two, comets, that, had, appeared, in, 1531, observed, by, petrus, apianus, and, 1607, observed, by, johannes, kepler, halley, thus, concluded, that, all, three, comets, were, in, fact, the, same, object, returning, about, every, 76, years, a, period, that, has, since, been, found, to, vary, between, 72, and, 80, years, after, a, rough, estimate, of, the, perturbations, the, comet, would, sustain, from, the, gravitational, attraction, of, the, planets, he, predicted, its, return, for, 1758, while, he, had, personally, observed, the, comet, around, perihelion, in, september, 1682, halley, died, in, 1742, before, he, could, observe, its, predicted, return, halley, s, prediction, of, the, comet, s, return, proved, to, be, correct, although, it, was, not, seen, until, 25, december, 1758, by, johann, georg, palitzsch, a, german, farmer, and, amateur, astronomer, it, did, not, pass, through, its, perihelion, until, 13, march, 1759, the, attraction, of, jupiter, and, saturn, having, caused, a, delay, of, 618, days, this, effect, was, computed, before, its, return, with, a, one, month, error, to, 13, april, by, a, team, of, three, french, mathematicians, alexis, clairaut, joseph, lalande, and, nicole, reine, lepaute, the, confirmation, of, the, comet, s, return, was, the, first, time, anything, other, than, planets, had, been, shown, to, orbit, the, sun, it, was, also, one, of, the, earliest, successful, tests, of, newtonian, physics, and, a, clear, demonstration, of, its, explanatory, power, the, comet, was, first, named, in, halley, s, honour, by, french, astronomer, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, in, 1759, some, scholars, have, proposed, that, first, century, mesopotamian, astronomers, already, had, recognised, halley, s, comet, as, periodic, this, theory, notes, a, passage, in, the, babylonian, talmud, tractate, horayot, that, refers, to, a, star, which, appears, once, in, seventy, years, that, makes, the, captains, of, the, ships, err, others, doubt, this, idea, based, on, historical, considerations, about, the, exact, timing, of, this, alleged, observation, and, suggest, it, refers, to, other, astronomical, phenomena, researchers, in, 1981, attempting, to, calculate, the, past, orbits, of, halley, by, numerical, integration, starting, from, accurate, observations, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, could, not, produce, accurate, results, further, back, than, 837, owing, to, a, close, approach, to, earth, in, that, year, it, was, necessary, to, use, ancient, chinese, comet, observations, to, constrain, their, calculations, halley, s, orbital, period, has, varied, between, 74, and, 80, years, since, 240, bc, its, orbit, around, the, sun, is, highly, elliptical, with, an, orbital, eccentricity, of, 0, 967, with, 0, being, a, circle, and, 1, being, a, parabolic, trajectory, the, perihelion, the, point, in, the, comet, s, orbit, when, it, is, nearest, the, sun, is, 0, 59, au, 88, million, km, this, is, between, the, orbits, of, mercury, and, venus, its, aphelion, or, farthest, distance, from, the, sun, is, 35, au, 5, 2, billion, km, roughly, the, orbital, distance, of, pluto, unlike, the, overwhelming, majority, of, objects, in, the, solar, system, halley, s, orbit, is, retrograde, it, orbits, the, sun, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, planets, or, clockwise, from, above, the, sun, s, north, pole, the, orbit, is, inclined, by, 18, to, the, ecliptic, with, much, of, it, lying, south, of, the, ecliptic, this, is, usually, represented, as, 162, to, account, for, halley, s, retrograde, orbit, that, retrograde, orbit, grants, halley, one, of, the, highest, velocities, relative, to, the, earth, of, any, object, in, the, solar, system, the, 1910, passage, was, at, a, relative, velocity, of, 70, 56, km, s, 157, 800, mph, because, its, orbit, comes, close, to, earth, s, in, two, places, halley, is, associated, with, two, meteor, showers, the, eta, aquariids, in, early, may, and, the, orionids, in, late, october, halley, is, classified, as, a, periodic, or, short, period, comet, one, with, an, orbit, lasting, 200, years, or, less, this, contrasts, it, with, long, period, comets, whose, orbits, last, for, thousands, of, years, periodic, comets, have, an, average, inclination, to, the, ecliptic, of, only, ten, degrees, and, an, orbital, period, of, just, 6, 5, years, so, halley, s, orbit, is, atypical, most, short, period, comets, those, with, orbital, periods, shorter, than, 20, years, and, inclinations, of, 30, degrees, or, less, are, called, jupiter, family, comets, those, resembling, halley, with, orbital, periods, of, between, 20, and, 200, years, and, inclinations, extending, from, zero, to, more, than, 90, degrees, are, called, halley, type, comets, as, of, 2024, 105, halley, type, comets, have, been, observed, compared, with, 816, identified, jupiter, family, comets, the, orbits, of, the, halley, type, comets, suggest, that, they, were, originally, long, period, comets, whose, orbits, were, perturbed, by, the, gravity, of, the, giant, planets, and, directed, into, the, inner, solar, system, if, halley, was, once, a, long, period, comet, it, is, likely, to, have, originated, in, the, oort, cloud, a, sphere, of, cometary, bodies, around, 20, 000, 50, 000, au, from, the, sun, conversely, the, jupiter, family, comets, are, generally, believed, to, originate, in, the, kuiper, belt, a, flat, disc, of, icy, debris, between, 30, au, neptune, s, orbit, and, 50, au, from, the, sun, in, the, scattered, disc, another, point, of, origin, for, the, halley, type, comets, was, proposed, in, 2008, when, a, trans, neptunian, object, with, a, retrograde, orbit, similar, to, halley, s, was, discovered, 2008, kv, 42, whose, orbit, takes, it, from, just, outside, that, of, uranus, to, twice, the, distance, of, pluto, it, may, be, a, member, of, a, new, population, of, small, solar, system, bodies, that, serves, as, the, source, of, halley, type, comets, halley, has, probably, been, in, its, current, orbit, for, 16, 000, 200, 000, years, although, it, is, not, possible, to, numerically, integrate, its, orbit, for, more, than, a, few, tens, of, apparitions, and, close, approaches, before, 837, ad, can, only, be, verified, from, recorded, observations, the, non, gravitational, effects, can, be, crucial, as, halley, approaches, the, sun, it, expels, jets, of, sublimating, gas, from, its, surface, which, knock, it, very, slightly, off, its, orbital, path, these, orbital, changes, cause, delays, in, its, perihelion, passage, of, four, days, on, average, in, 1989, boris, chirikov, and, vitold, vecheslavov, performed, an, analysis, of, 46, apparitions, of, halley, s, comet, taken, from, historical, records, and, computer, simulations, which, showed, that, its, dynamics, were, chaotic, and, unpredictable, on, long, timescales, halley, s, projected, dynamical, lifetime, is, estimated, to, be, about, 10, million, years, the, dynamics, of, its, orbit, can, be, approximately, described, by, a, two, dimensional, symplectic, map, known, as, the, kepler, map, a, solution, to, the, restricted, three, body, problem, for, highly, eccentric, orbits, based, on, records, from, the, 1910, apparition, david, hughes, calculated, in, 1985, that, halley, s, nucleus, has, been, reduced, in, mass, by, 80, to, 90, over, the, last, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, revolutions, and, that, it, will, most, likely, disappear, completely, after, another, 2, 300, perihelion, passages, more, recent, work, suggests, that, halley, will, evaporate, or, split, in, two, within, the, next, few, tens, of, thousands, of, years, or, will, be, ejected, from, the, solar, system, within, a, few, hundred, thousand, years, the, giotto, and, vega, missions, gave, planetary, scientists, their, first, view, of, halley, s, surface, and, structure, the, nucleus, is, a, conglomerate, of, ices, and, dust, often, referred, to, as, a, dirty, snowball, like, all, comets, as, halley, nears, the, sun, its, volatile, compounds, those, with, low, boiling, points, such, as, water, carbon, monoxide, carbon, dioxide, and, other, ices, begin, to, sublimate, from, the, surface, this, causes, the, comet, to, develop, a, coma, or, atmosphere, at, distances, up, to, 230, 000, kilometres, 140, 000, mi, from, the, nucleus, sublimation, of, this, dirty, ice, releases, dust, particles, which, travel, with, the, gas, away, from, the, nucleus, gas, molecules, in, the, coma, absorb, solar, light, and, then, re, radiate, it, at, different, wavelengths, a, phenomenon, known, as, fluorescence, whereas, dust, particles, scatter, the, solar, light, both, processes, are, responsible, for, making, the, coma, visible, as, a, fraction, of, the, gas, molecules, in, the, coma, are, ionised, by, the, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, pressure, from, the, solar, wind, a, stream, of, charged, particles, emitted, by, the, sun, pulls, the, coma, s, ions, out, into, a, long, tail, which, may, extend, more, than, 100, million, kilometres, into, space, changes, in, the, flow, of, the, solar, wind, can, cause, disconnection, events, in, which, the, tail, completely, breaks, off, from, the, nucleus, despite, the, vast, size, of, its, coma, halley, s, nucleus, is, relatively, small, barely, 15, kilometres, 9, 3, mi, long, 8, kilometres, 5, 0, mi, wide, and, perhaps, 8, kilometres, 5, 0, mi, thick, based, on, a, reanalysis, of, images, taken, by, the, giotto, and, vega, spacecraft, lamy, et, al, determined, an, effective, diameter, of, 11, kilometres, 6, 8, mi, its, shape, has, been, variously, compared, to, that, of, a, peanut, a, potato, or, an, avocado, its, mass, is, roughly, 2, 2, 10, 14, kg, with, an, average, density, of, about, 0, 55, grams, per, cubic, centimetre, 0, 32, oz, cu, in, the, low, density, indicates, that, it, is, made, of, a, large, number, of, small, pieces, held, together, very, loosely, forming, a, structure, known, as, a, rubble, pile, ground, based, observations, of, coma, brightness, suggested, that, halley, s, rotation, period, was, about, 7, 4, days, images, taken, by, the, various, spacecraft, along, with, observations, of, the, jets, and, shell, suggested, a, period, of, 52, hours, given, the, irregular, shape, of, the, nucleus, halley, s, rotation, is, likely, to, be, complex, the, flyby, images, revealed, an, extremely, varied, topography, with, hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and, at, least, one, crater, halley, s, day, side, the, side, facing, the, sun, is, far, more, active, than, the, night, side, spacecraft, observations, showed, that, the, gases, ejected, from, the, nucleus, were, 80, water, vapour, 17, carbon, monoxide, and, 3, 4, carbon, dioxide, with, traces, of, hydrocarbons, although, more, recent, sources, give, a, value, of, 10, for, carbon, monoxide, and, also, include, traces, of, methane, and, ammonia, the, dust, particles, were, found, to, be, primarily, a, mixture, of, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chon, compounds, common, in, the, outer, solar, system, and, silicates, such, as, are, found, in, terrestrial, rocks, the, dust, particles, ranged, in, size, down, to, the, limits, of, detection, 0, 001, m, the, ratio, of, deuterium, to, hydrogen, in, the, water, released, by, halley, was, initially, thought, to, be, similar, to, that, found, in, earth, s, ocean, water, suggesting, that, halley, type, comets, may, have, delivered, water, to, earth, in, the, distant, past, subsequent, observations, showed, halley, s, deuterium, ratio, to, be, far, higher, than, that, found, in, earth, s, oceans, making, such, comets, unlikely, sources, for, earth, s, water, giotto, provided, the, first, evidence, in, support, of, fred, whipple, s, dirty, snowball, hypothesis, for, comet, construction, whipple, postulated, that, comets, are, icy, objects, warmed, by, the, sun, as, they, approach, the, inner, solar, system, causing, ices, on, their, surfaces, to, sublime, change, directly, from, a, solid, to, a, gas, and, jets, of, volatile, material, to, burst, outward, creating, the, coma, giotto, showed, that, this, model, was, broadly, correct, though, with, modifications, halley, s, albedo, for, instance, is, about, 4, meaning, that, it, reflects, only, 4, of, the, sunlight, hitting, it, about, what, one, would, expect, for, coal, thus, despite, astronomers, predicting, that, halley, would, have, an, albedo, of, about, 0, 17, roughly, equivalent, to, bare, soil, halley, s, comet, is, in, fact, pitch, black, the, dirty, ices, on, the, surface, sublime, at, temperatures, between, 170, k, 103, c, in, sections, of, higher, albedo, to, 220, k, 53, c, at, low, albedo, vega, 1, found, halley, s, surface, temperature, to, be, in, the, range, 300, 400, k, 27, 127, c, this, suggested, that, only, 10, of, halley, s, surface, was, active, and, that, large, portions, of, it, were, coated, in, a, layer, of, dark, dust, that, retained, heat, together, these, observations, suggested, that, halley, was, in, fact, predominantly, composed, of, non, volatile, materials, and, thus, more, closely, resembled, a, snowy, dirtball, than, a, dirty, snowball, the, first, certain, appearance, of, halley, s, comet, in, the, historical, record, is, a, description, from, 240, bc, in, the, chinese, chronicle, records, of, the, grand, historian, or, shiji, which, describes, a, comet, that, appeared, in, the, east, and, moved, north, the, only, surviving, record, of, the, 164, bc, apparition, is, found, on, two, fragmentary, babylonian, tablets, which, were, rediscovered, in, august, 1984, in, the, collection, of, the, british, museum, the, apparition, of, 87, bc, was, recorded, in, babylonian, tablets, which, state, that, the, comet, was, seen, day, beyond, day, for, a, month, this, appearance, may, be, recalled, in, the, representation, of, tigranes, the, great, an, armenian, king, who, is, depicted, on, coins, with, a, crown, that, features, according, to, vahe, gurzadyan, and, r, vardanyan, a, star, with, a, curved, tail, may, represent, the, passage, of, halley, s, comet, in, 87, bc, gurzadyan, and, vardanyan, argue, that, tigranes, could, have, seen, halley, s, comet, when, it, passed, closest, to, the, sun, on, august, 6, in, 87, bc, as, the, comet, would, have, been, a, most, recordable, event, for, ancient, armenians, it, could, have, heralded, the, new, era, of, the, brilliant, king, of, kings, the, apparition, of, 12, bc, was, recorded, in, the, book, of, han, by, chinese, astronomers, of, the, han, dynasty, who, tracked, it, from, august, through, october, it, passed, within, 0, 16, au, of, earth, according, to, the, roman, historian, cassius, dio, a, comet, appeared, suspended, over, rome, for, several, days, portending, the, death, of, marcus, vipsanius, agrippa, in, that, year, halley, s, appearance, in, 12, bc, only, a, few, years, distant, from, the, conventionally, assigned, date, of, the, birth, of, jesus, christ, has, led, some, theologians, and, astronomers, to, suggest, that, it, might, explain, the, biblical, story, of, the, star, of, bethlehem, there, are, other, explanations, for, the, phenomenon, such, as, planetary, conjunctions, and, there, are, also, records, of, other, comets, that, appeared, closer, to, the, date, of, jesus, s, birth, if, yehoshua, ben, hananiah, s, reference, to, a, star, which, arises, once, in, seventy, years, and, misleads, the, sailors, refers, to, halley, s, comet, he, can, only, have, witnessed, the, 66, ad, appearance, another, possible, report, comes, from, jewish, historian, josephus, who, wrote, that, in, 66, ad, the, signs, were, so, evident, and, did, so, plainly, foretell, their, future, desolation, there, was, a, star, resembling, a, sword, which, stood, over, the, city, and, a, comet, that, continued, a, whole, year, this, portent, was, in, reference, to, the, city, of, jerusalem, and, the, first, jewish, roman, war, the, 141, ad, apparition, was, recorded, in, chinese, chronicles, the, 374, ad, and, 607, approaches, each, came, within, 0, 09, au, of, earth, the, 451, ad, apparition, was, said, to, herald, the, defeat, of, attila, the, hun, at, the, battle, of, chalons, the, 684, ad, apparition, was, reported, in, chinese, records, as, the, broom, star, the, 760, ad, apparition, was, recorded, in, the, zuqnin, chronicle, s, entry, for, iyy, r, 1071, se, may, 760, ad, calling, it, a, white, sign, the, year, one, thousand, seventy, one, ad, 759, 760, in, the, month, of, iyy, r, may, a, white, sign, was, seen, in, the, sky, before, early, twilight, in, the, north, east, in, the, zodiac, which, is, called, aries, to, the, north, from, these, three, stars, in, it, which, are, very, shining, and, it, resembled, in, its, shape, a, broom, and, the, sign, itself, remained, for, fifteen, nights, until, dawn, of, the, feast, of, pentecost, in, 837, ad, halley, s, comet, may, have, passed, as, close, as, 0, 03, astronomical, units, 2, 8, million, miles, 4, 5, million, kilometres, from, earth, by, far, its, closest, approach, its, tail, may, have, stretched, 60, degrees, across, the, sky, it, was, recorded, by, astronomers, in, china, japan, germany, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, middle, east, emperor, louis, the, pious, observed, this, appearance, and, devoted, himself, to, prayer, and, penance, fearing, that, by, this, token, a, change, in, the, realm, and, the, death, of, a, prince, are, made, known, in, 912, ad, halley, is, recorded, in, the, annals, of, ulster, which, states, a, dark, and, rainy, year, a, comet, appeared, in, 1066, the, comet, was, seen, in, england, and, thought, to, be, an, omen, later, that, year, harold, ii, of, england, died, at, the, battle, of, hastings, and, william, the, conqueror, claimed, the, throne, the, comet, is, represented, on, the, bayeux, tapestry, and, described, in, the, tituli, as, a, star, surviving, accounts, from, the, period, describe, it, as, appearing, to, be, four, times, the, size, of, venus, and, shining, with, a, light, equal, to, a, quarter, of, that, of, the, moon, halley, came, within, 0, 10, au, of, earth, at, that, time, this, appearance, of, the, comet, is, also, noted, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, eilmer, of, malmesbury, may, have, seen, halley, in, 989, and, 1066, as, recorded, by, william, of, malmesbury, not, long, after, a, comet, portending, they, say, a, change, in, governments, appeared, trailing, its, long, flaming, hair, through, the, empty, sky, concerning, which, there, was, a, fine, saying, of, a, monk, of, our, monastery, called, thelm, r, crouching, in, terror, at, the, sight, of, the, gleaming, star, you, ve, come, have, you, he, said, you, ve, come, you, source, of, tears, to, many, mothers, it, is, long, since, i, saw, you, but, as, i, see, you, now, you, are, much, more, terrible, for, i, see, you, brandishing, the, downfall, of, my, country, the, irish, annals, of, the, four, masters, recorded, the, comet, as, a, star, appeared, on, the, seventh, of, the, calends, of, may, on, tuesday, after, little, easter, than, whose, light, the, brilliance, or, light, of, the, moon, was, not, greater, and, it, was, visible, to, all, in, this, manner, till, the, end, of, four, nights, afterwards, chaco, native, americans, in, new, mexico, may, have, recorded, the, 1066, apparition, in, their, petroglyphs, the, italo, byzantine, chronicle, of, lupus, the, protospatharios, mentions, that, a, comet, star, appeared, in, the, sky, in, the, year, 1067, the, chronicle, is, erroneous, as, the, event, occurred, in, 1066, and, by, robert, he, means, william, the, emperor, constantine, ducas, died, in, the, month, of, may, and, his, son, michael, received, the, empire, and, in, this, year, there, appeared, a, comet, star, and, the, norman, count, robert, fought, a, battle, with, harold, king, of, the, english, and, robert, was, victorious, and, became, king, over, the, people, of, the, english, the, 1145, apparition, may, have, been, recorded, by, the, monk, eadwine, according, to, legend, genghis, khan, was, inspired, to, turn, his, conquests, toward, europe, by, the, westward, seeming, trajectory, of, the, 1222, apparition, in, korea, the, comet, was, reportedly, visible, during, the, daylight, on, 9, september, 1222, the, 1301, apparition, was, visually, spectacular, and, may, be, the, first, that, resulted, in, convincing, portraits, of, a, particular, comet, the, florentine, chronicler, giovanni, villani, wrote, that, the, comet, left, great, trails, of, fumes, behind, and, that, it, remained, visible, from, september, 1301, until, january, 1302, it, was, seen, by, the, artist, giotto, di, bondone, who, represented, the, star, of, bethlehem, as, a, fire, coloured, comet, in, the, nativity, section, of, his, arena, chapel, cycle, completed, in, 1305, giotto, s, depiction, includes, details, of, the, coma, a, sweeping, tail, and, the, central, condensation, according, to, the, art, historian, roberta, olson, it, is, much, more, accurate, than, other, contemporary, descriptions, and, was, not, equaled, in, painting, until, the, 19th, century, olson, s, identification, of, halley, s, comet, in, giotto, s, adoration, of, the, magi, is, what, inspired, the, european, space, agency, to, name, their, mission, to, the, comet, giotto, after, the, artist, halley, s, 1378, appearance, is, recorded, in, the, annales, mediolanenses, as, well, as, in, east, asian, sources, in, 1456, the, year, of, halley, s, next, apparition, the, ottoman, empire, invaded, the, kingdom, of, hungary, culminating, in, the, siege, of, belgrade, in, july, of, that, year, in, a, papal, bull, pope, callixtus, iii, ordered, special, prayers, be, said, for, the, city, s, protection, in, 1470, the, humanist, scholar, bartolomeo, platina, wrote, in, his, lives, of, the, popes, that, a, hairy, and, fiery, star, having, then, made, its, appearance, for, several, days, the, mathematicians, declared, that, there, would, follow, grievous, pestilence, dearth, and, some, great, calamity, calixtus, to, avert, the, wrath, of, god, ordered, supplications, that, if, evils, were, impending, for, the, human, race, he, would, turn, all, upon, the, turks, the, enemies, of, the, christian, name, he, likewise, ordered, to, move, god, by, continual, entreaty, that, notice, should, be, given, by, the, bells, to, call, the, faithful, at, midday, to, aid, by, their, prayers, those, engaged, in, battle, with, the, turk, platina, s, account, is, not, mentioned, in, official, records, in, the, 18th, century, a, frenchman, further, embellished, the, story, in, anger, at, the, church, by, claiming, that, the, pope, had, excommunicated, the, comet, though, this, story, was, most, likely, his, own, invention, halley, s, apparition, of, 1456, was, also, witnessed, in, kashmir, and, depicted, in, great, detail, by, r, vara, a, sanskrit, poet, and, biographer, to, the, sultans, of, kashmir, he, read, the, apparition, as, a, cometary, portent, of, doom, foreshadowing, the, imminent, fall, of, sultan, zayn, al, abidin, ad, 1418, 1420, 1470, after, witnessing, a, bright, light, in, the, sky, which, most, historians, have, identified, as, halley, s, comet, zara, yaqob, emperor, of, ethiopia, from, 1434, to, 1468, founded, the, city, of, debre, berhan, tr, city, of, light, and, made, it, his, capital, for, the, remainder, of, his, reign, petrus, apianus, and, girolamo, fracastoro, described, the, comet, s, visit, in, 1531, with, the, former, even, including, graphics, in, his, publication, through, his, observations, apianus, was, able, to, prove, that, a, comet, s, tail, always, points, away, from, the, sun, in, the, sikh, scriptures, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, the, founder, of, the, faith, guru, nanak, makes, reference, to, a, long, star, that, has, risen, at, ang, 1110, and, it, is, believed, by, some, sikh, scholars, to, be, a, reference, to, halley, s, appearance, in, 1531, halley, s, periodic, returns, have, been, subject, to, scientific, investigation, since, the, 16th, century, the, three, apparitions, from, 1531, to, 1682, were, noted, by, edmond, halley, enabling, him, to, predict, it, would, return, one, key, breakthrough, occurred, when, halley, talked, with, newton, about, his, ideas, of, the, laws, of, motion, newton, also, helped, halley, get, john, flamsteed, s, data, on, the, 1682, apparition, by, studying, data, on, the, 1531, 1607, and, 1682, comets, he, came, to, the, conclusion, these, were, the, same, comet, and, presented, his, findings, in, 1696, one, difficulty, was, accounting, for, variations, in, the, comet, s, orbital, period, which, was, over, a, year, longer, between, 1531, and, 1607, than, it, was, between, 1607, and, 1682, newton, had, theorised, that, such, delays, were, caused, by, the, gravity, of, other, comets, but, halley, found, that, jupiter, and, saturn, would, cause, the, appropriate, delays, in, the, decades, that, followed, more, refined, mathematics, would, be, worked, on, notable, by, paris, observatory, the, work, on, halley, also, provided, a, boost, to, newton, and, kepler, s, rules, for, celestial, motions, see, also, computation, of, orbit, at, markree, observatory, in, ireland, edward, joshua, cooper, used, a, cauchoix, of, paris, lens, telescope, with, an, aperture, of, 340, millimetres, 13, 3, in, to, sketch, halley, s, comet, in, 1835, the, same, apparition, was, sketched, by, german, astronomer, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, observations, of, streams, of, vapour, prompted, bessel, to, propose, that, the, jet, forces, of, evaporating, material, could, be, great, enough, to, significantly, alter, a, comet, s, orbit, an, interview, in, 1910, of, someone, who, was, a, teenager, at, the, time, of, the, 1835, apparition, had, this, to, say, when, the, comet, was, first, seen, it, appeared, in, the, western, sky, its, head, toward, the, north, and, tail, towards, the, south, about, horizontal, and, considerably, above, the, horizon, and, quite, a, distance, south, of, the, sun, it, could, be, plainly, seen, directly, after, sunset, every, day, and, was, visible, for, a, long, time, perhaps, a, month, they, go, on, to, describe, the, comet, s, tail, as, being, more, broad, and, not, as, long, as, the, comet, of, 1843, they, had, also, witnessed, famous, astronomers, across, the, world, made, observations, starting, august, 1835, including, struve, at, dorpat, observatory, and, sir, john, herschel, who, made, of, observations, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, the, united, states, telescopic, observations, were, made, from, yale, college, the, new, observations, helped, confirm, early, appearances, of, this, comet, including, its, 1456, and, 1378, apparitions, at, yale, college, in, connecticut, the, comet, was, first, reported, on, 31, august, 1835, by, astronomers, d, olmstead, and, e, loomis, in, canada, reports, were, made, from, newfoundland, and, also, quebec, reports, came, in, from, all, over, by, later, 1835, and, often, reported, in, newspapers, of, this, time, in, canada, several, accounts, of, the, 1835, apparition, were, made, by, observers, who, survived, until, the, 1910, return, where, increased, interest, in, the, comet, led, to, their, being, interviewed, the, time, to, halley, s, return, in, 1910, would, be, only, 74, 42, years, one, of, the, shortest, known, periods, of, its, return, which, is, calculated, to, be, as, long, as, 79, years, owing, to, the, effects, of, the, planets, at, paris, observatory, halley, s, comet, 1835, apparition, was, observed, with, a, lerebours, telescope, of, 24, 4, cm, 9, 6, in, aperture, by, the, astronomer, fran, ois, arago, arago, recorded, polarimetric, observations, of, halley, and, suggested, that, the, tail, might, be, sunlight, reflecting, off, a, sparsely, distributed, material, he, had, earlier, made, similar, observations, of, comet, tralles, of, 1819, the, 1910, approach, which, came, into, naked, eye, view, around, 10, april, and, came, to, perihelion, on, 20, april, was, notable, for, several, reasons, it, was, the, first, approach, of, which, photographs, exist, and, the, first, for, which, spectroscopic, data, were, obtained, furthermore, the, comet, made, a, relatively, close, approach, of, 0, 15, au, making, it, a, spectacular, sight, indeed, on, 19, may, earth, actually, passed, through, the, tail, of, the, comet, one, of, the, substances, discovered, in, the, tail, by, spectroscopic, analysis, was, the, toxic, gas, cyanogen, which, led, press, to, misquote, the, astronomer, camille, flammarion, by, stating, he, claimed, that, when, earth, passed, through, the, tail, the, gas, would, impregnate, the, atmosphere, and, possibly, snuff, out, all, life, on, the, planet, despite, reassurances, from, scientists, that, the, gas, would, not, inflict, harm, on, earth, the, damage, had, already, been, done, with, members, of, the, public, panic, buying, gas, masks, and, quack, anti, comet, pills, the, comet, added, to, the, unrest, in, china, on, the, eve, of, the, xinhai, revolution, that, would, end, the, last, dynasty, in, 1911, as, james, hutson, a, missionary, in, sichuan, province, at, the, time, recorded, the, people, believe, that, it, indicates, calamity, such, as, war, fire, pestilence, and, a, change, of, dynasty, in, some, places, on, certain, days, the, doors, were, unopened, for, half, a, day, no, water, was, carried, and, many, did, not, even, drink, water, as, it, was, rumoured, that, pestilential, vapour, was, being, poured, down, upon, the, earth, from, the, comet, the, 1910, visitation, is, also, recorded, as, being, the, travelling, companion, of, hedley, churchward, the, first, known, english, muslim, to, make, the, haj, pilgrimage, to, mecca, however, his, explanation, of, its, scientific, predictability, did, not, meet, with, favour, in, the, holy, city, the, comet, was, used, in, an, advertising, campaign, of, le, bon, march, a, well, known, department, store, in, paris, the, comet, was, also, fertile, ground, for, hoaxes, one, that, reached, major, newspapers, claimed, that, the, sacred, followers, a, supposed, oklahoma, religious, group, attempted, to, sacrifice, a, virgin, to, ward, off, the, impending, disaster, but, were, stopped, by, the, police, american, satirist, and, writer, mark, twain, was, born, on, 30, november, 1835, exactly, two, weeks, after, the, comet, s, perihelion, in, his, autobiography, published, in, 1909, he, said, i, came, in, with, halley, s, comet, in, 1835, it, is, coming, again, next, year, and, i, expect, to, go, out, with, it, it, will, be, the, greatest, disappointment, of, my, life, if, i, don, t, go, out, with, halley, s, comet, the, almighty, has, said, no, doubt, now, here, are, these, two, unaccountable, freaks, they, came, in, together, they, must, go, out, together, twain, died, on, 21, april, 1910, the, day, following, the, comet, s, subsequent, perihelion, the, 1985, fantasy, film, the, adventures, of, mark, twain, was, inspired, by, the, quotation, halley, s, 1910, apparition, is, distinct, from, the, great, daylight, comet, of, 1910, which, surpassed, halley, in, brilliance, and, was, visible, in, broad, daylight, for, a, short, period, approximately, four, months, before, halley, made, its, appearance, the, 1986, apparition, of, halley, s, comet, was, the, least, favourable, on, record, in, february, 1986, the, comet, and, the, earth, were, on, opposite, sides, of, the, sun, creating, the, worst, possible, viewing, circumstances, for, earth, observers, during, the, previous, 2, 000, years, halley, s, closest, approach, was, 0, 42, au, additionally, increased, light, pollution, from, urbanization, caused, many, people, to, fail, in, attempts, to, see, the, comet, with, the, help, of, binoculars, observation, from, areas, outside, cities, was, more, successful, further, the, comet, appeared, brightest, when, it, was, almost, invisible, from, the, northern, hemisphere, in, march, and, april, 1986, with, best, opportunities, occurring, when, the, comet, could, be, sighted, close, to, the, horizon, at, dawn, and, dusk, if, not, obscured, by, clouds, the, approach, of, the, comet, was, first, detected, by, astronomers, david, c, jewitt, and, g, edward, danielson, on, 16, october, 1982, using, the, 5, 1, m, hale, telescope, at, mount, palomar, and, a, ccd, camera, the, first, visual, observation, of, the, comet, on, its, 1986, return, was, by, an, amateur, astronomer, stephen, james, o, meara, on, 24, january, 1985, o, meara, used, a, home, built, 610, millimetre, 24, in, telescope, on, top, of, mauna, kea, to, detect, the, magnitude, 19, 6, comet, the, first, to, observe, halley, s, comet, with, the, naked, eye, during, its, 1986, apparition, were, stephen, edberg, then, serving, as, the, coordinator, for, amateur, observations, at, the, nasa, jet, propulsion, laboratory, and, charles, morris, on, 8, november, 1985, the, 1986, apparition, gave, scientists, the, opportunity, to, study, the, comet, closely, and, several, probes, were, launched, to, do, so, the, soviet, vega, 1, probe, began, returning, images, of, halley, on, 4, march, 1986, captured, the, first, ever, image, of, its, nucleus, and, made, its, flyby, on, 6, march, it, was, followed, by, the, vega, 2, probe, making, its, flyby, on, 9, march, on, 14, march, the, giotto, space, probe, launched, by, the, european, space, agency, made, the, closest, pass, of, the, comet, s, nucleus, there, also, were, two, japanese, probes, suisei, and, sakigake, unofficially, the, numerous, probes, became, known, as, the, halley, armada, based, on, data, retrieved, by, the, largest, ultraviolet, space, telescope, of, the, time, astron, in, december, 1985, a, group, of, soviet, scientists, developed, a, model, of, the, comet, s, coma, the, comet, also, was, observed, from, space, by, the, international, cometary, explorer, ice, originally, launched, as, the, international, sun, earth, explorer, 3, the, spacecraft, was, renamed, and, departed, the, sun, earth, l, 1, lagrangian, point, in, 1982, in, order, to, intercept, the, comets, 21p, giacobini, zinner, and, halley, ice, flew, through, the, tail, of, halley, s, comet, coming, within, about, 40, 2, million, km, 25, 0, million, mi, of, the, nucleus, on, 28, march, 1986, two, u, s, space, shuttle, missions, sts, 51, l, and, sts, 61, e, had, been, scheduled, to, observe, halley, s, comet, from, low, earth, orbit, the, sts, 51, l, mission, carried, the, shuttle, pointed, tool, for, astronomy, spartan, halley, satellite, also, called, the, halley, s, comet, experiment, deployable, hced, the, mission, to, capture, the, ultraviolet, spectrum, of, the, comet, ended, in, disaster, when, the, space, shuttle, challenger, exploded, in, flight, killing, all, seven, astronauts, onboard, scheduled, for, march, 1986, sts, 61, e, was, a, columbia, mission, carrying, the, astro, 1, platform, to, study, the, comet, but, the, mission, was, cancelled, following, the, challenger, disaster, and, astro, 1, would, not, fly, until, late, 1990, on, sts, 35, in, japan, the, comet, was, observed, by, emperor, hirohito, who, was, 84, he, had, already, seen, it, in, 1910, when, he, was, 8, he, became, one, of, the, few, people, in, human, history, to, have, seen, halley, s, comet, on, two, different, cycles, on, 12, february, 1991, at, a, distance, of, 14, 3, au, 2, 14, 10, 9, km, from, the, sun, halley, displayed, an, outburst, that, lasted, for, several, months, the, comet, released, dust, with, a, total, mass, of, about, 10, 8, kg, which, spread, into, an, elongated, cloud, roughly, 374, 000, km, 232, 000, mi, by, 269, 000, km, 167, 000, mi, in, size, the, outburst, likely, started, in, december, 1990, and, then, the, comet, brightened, from, about, magnitude, 25, to, magnitude, 19, comets, rarely, show, outburst, activity, at, distances, beyond, 5, au, from, the, sun, different, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, for, the, outburst, ranging, from, interaction, with, the, solar, wind, to, a, collision, with, an, undiscovered, asteroid, the, most, likely, explanation, is, a, combination, of, two, effects, the, polymerization, of, hydrogen, cyanide, and, a, phase, transition, of, amorphous, water, ice, which, raised, the, temperature, of, the, nucleus, enough, for, some, of, the, more, volatile, compounds, on, its, surface, to, sublime, halley, was, most, recently, observed, in, 2003, by, three, of, the, very, large, telescopes, at, paranal, chile, when, halley, s, magnitude, was, 28, 2, the, telescopes, observed, halley, at, the, faintest, and, farthest, any, comet, had, ever, been, imaged, in, order, to, verify, a, method, for, finding, very, faint, trans, neptunian, objects, astronomers, are, now, able, to, observe, the, comet, at, any, point, in, its, orbit, on, 9, december, 2023, halley, s, comet, reached, the, farthest, and, slowest, point, in, its, orbit, from, the, sun, when, it, was, travelling, at, 0, 91, km, s, 2, 000, mph, with, respect, to, the, sun, the, next, perihelion, of, halley, s, comet, is, predicted, for, 28, july, 2061, when, it, will, be, better, positioned, for, observation, than, during, the, 1985, 1986, apparition, as, it, will, be, on, the, same, side, of, the, sun, as, earth, the, closest, approach, to, earth, will, be, one, day, after, perihelion, it, is, expected, to, have, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 3, compared, with, only, 2, 1, for, the, 1986, apparition, on, 9, september, 2060, halley, will, pass, within, 0, 98, au, 147, 000, 000, km, of, jupiter, and, then, on, 20, august, 2061, will, pass, within, 0, 0543, au, 8, 120, 000, km, of, venus, halley, will, come, to, perihelion, on, 27, march, 2134, then, on, 7, may, 2134, halley, will, pass, within, 0, 092, au, 13, 800, 000, km, of, earth, its, apparent, magnitude, is, expected, to, be, 2, 0, halley, s, calculations, enabled, the, comet, s, earlier, appearances, to, be, found, in, the, historical, record, the, following, table, sets, out, the, astronomical, designations, for, every, apparition, of, halley, s, comet, from, 240, bc, the, earliest, documented, sighting, in, the, designations, 1p, refers, to, halley, s, comet, the, first, periodic, comet, discovered, the, number, represents, the, year, with, negatives, representing, bc, the, letter, number, combination, indicates, which, it, was, of, the, comets, observed, for, a, given, segment, of, the, year, divided, into, 24, equal, parts, the, roman, numeral, indicates, which, comet, past, perihelion, it, was, for, a, given, year, while, the, lower, case, letter, indicates, which, comet, it, was, for, a, given, year, overall, the, perihelion, dates, farther, from, the, present, are, approximate, mainly, because, of, uncertainties, in, the, modelling, of, non, gravitational, effects, perihelion, dates, of, 1531, and, earlier, are, in, the, julian, calendar, while, perihelion, dates, 1607, and, after, are, in, the, gregorian, calendar, the, perihelion, dates, for, some, of, the, early, apparitions, particularly, before, 837, ad, are, uncertain, by, a, couple, of, days, while, halley, s, comet, usually, peaks, at, around, 0th, magnitude, there, are, indications, that, the, comet, got, considerably, brighter, than, that, in, the, past
