space, is, a, three, dimensional, continuum, containing, positions, and, directions, in, classical, physics, physical, space, is, often, conceived, in, three, linear, dimensions, modern, physicists, usually, consider, it, with, time, to, be, part, of, a, boundless, four, dimensional, continuum, known, as, spacetime, the, concept, of, space, is, considered, to, be, of, fundamental, importance, to, an, understanding, of, the, physical, universe, however, disagreement, continues, between, philosophers, over, whether, it, is, itself, an, entity, a, relationship, between, entities, or, part, of, a, conceptual, framework, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, mathematicians, began, to, examine, geometries, that, are, non, euclidean, in, which, space, is, conceived, as, curved, rather, than, flat, as, in, the, euclidean, space, according, to, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, space, around, gravitational, fields, deviates, from, euclidean, space, experimental, tests, of, general, relativity, have, confirmed, that, non, euclidean, geometries, provide, a, better, model, for, the, shape, of, space, debates, concerning, the, nature, essence, and, the, mode, of, existence, of, space, date, back, to, antiquity, namely, to, treatises, like, the, timaeus, of, plato, or, socrates, in, his, reflections, on, what, the, greeks, called, kh, ra, i, e, space, or, in, the, physics, of, aristotle, book, iv, delta, in, the, definition, of, topos, i, e, place, or, in, the, later, geometrical, conception, of, place, as, space, qua, extension, in, the, discourse, on, place, qawl, fi, al, makan, of, the, 11th, century, arab, polymath, alhazen, many, of, these, classical, philosophical, questions, were, discussed, in, the, renaissance, and, then, reformulated, in, the, 17th, century, particularly, during, the, early, development, of, classical, mechanics, isaac, newton, viewed, space, as, absolute, existing, permanently, and, independently, of, whether, there, was, any, matter, in, the, in, contrast, other, natural, philosophers, notably, gottfried, leibniz, thought, that, space, was, in, fact, a, collection, of, relations, between, objects, given, by, their, distance, and, direction, from, one, another, in, the, 18th, century, the, philosopher, and, theologian, george, berkeley, attempted, to, refute, the, visibility, of, spatial, depth, in, his, essay, towards, a, new, theory, of, vision, later, the, metaphysician, immanuel, kant, said, that, the, concepts, of, space, and, time, are, not, empirical, ones, derived, from, experiences, of, the, outside, world, they, are, elements, of, an, already, given, systematic, framework, that, humans, possess, and, use, to, structure, all, experiences, kant, referred, to, the, experience, of, space, in, his, critique, of, pure, reason, as, being, a, subjective, pure, a, priori, form, of, intuition, galilean, and, cartesian, theories, about, space, matter, and, motion, are, at, the, foundation, of, the, scientific, revolution, which, is, understood, to, have, culminated, with, the, publication, of, newton, s, principia, mathematica, in, 1687, newton, s, theories, about, space, and, time, helped, him, explain, the, movement, of, objects, while, his, theory, of, space, is, considered, the, most, influential, in, physics, it, emerged, from, his, predecessors, ideas, about, the, same, as, one, of, the, pioneers, of, modern, science, galileo, revised, the, established, aristotelian, and, ptolemaic, ideas, about, a, geocentric, cosmos, he, backed, the, copernican, theory, that, the, universe, was, heliocentric, with, a, stationary, sun, at, the, center, and, the, planets, including, the, earth, revolving, around, the, sun, if, the, earth, moved, the, aristotelian, belief, that, its, natural, tendency, was, to, remain, at, rest, was, in, question, galileo, wanted, to, prove, instead, that, the, sun, moved, around, its, axis, that, motion, was, as, natural, to, an, object, as, the, state, of, rest, in, other, words, for, galileo, celestial, bodies, including, the, earth, were, naturally, inclined, to, move, in, circles, this, view, displaced, another, aristotelian, idea, that, all, objects, gravitated, towards, their, designated, natural, place, of, belonging, descartes, set, out, to, replace, the, aristotelian, worldview, with, a, theory, about, space, and, motion, as, determined, by, natural, laws, in, other, words, he, sought, a, metaphysical, foundation, or, a, mechanical, explanation, for, his, theories, about, matter, and, motion, cartesian, space, was, euclidean, in, structure, infinite, uniform, and, flat, it, was, defined, as, that, which, contained, matter, conversely, matter, by, definition, had, a, spatial, extension, so, that, there, was, no, such, thing, as, empty, space, the, cartesian, notion, of, space, is, closely, linked, to, his, theories, about, the, nature, of, the, body, mind, and, matter, he, is, famously, known, for, his, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, am, or, the, idea, that, we, can, only, be, certain, of, the, fact, that, we, can, doubt, and, therefore, think, and, therefore, exist, his, theories, belong, to, the, rationalist, tradition, which, attributes, knowledge, about, the, world, to, our, ability, to, think, rather, than, to, our, experiences, as, the, empiricists, believe, he, posited, a, clear, distinction, between, the, body, and, mind, which, is, referred, to, as, the, cartesian, dualism, following, galileo, and, descartes, during, the, seventeenth, century, the, philosophy, of, space, and, time, revolved, around, the, ideas, of, gottfried, leibniz, a, german, philosopher, mathematician, and, isaac, newton, who, set, out, two, opposing, theories, of, what, space, is, rather, than, being, an, entity, that, independently, exists, over, and, above, other, matter, leibniz, held, that, space, is, no, more, than, the, collection, of, spatial, relations, between, objects, in, the, world, space, is, that, which, results, from, places, taken, together, unoccupied, regions, are, those, that, could, have, objects, in, them, and, thus, spatial, relations, with, other, places, for, leibniz, then, space, was, an, idealised, abstraction, from, the, relations, between, individual, entities, or, their, possible, locations, and, therefore, could, not, be, continuous, but, must, be, discrete, space, could, be, thought, of, in, a, similar, way, to, the, relations, between, family, members, although, people, in, the, family, are, related, to, one, another, the, relations, do, not, exist, independently, of, the, people, leibniz, argued, that, space, could, not, exist, independently, of, objects, in, the, world, because, that, implies, a, difference, between, two, universes, exactly, alike, except, for, the, location, of, the, material, world, in, each, universe, but, since, there, would, be, no, observational, way, of, telling, these, universes, apart, then, according, to, the, identity, of, indiscernibles, there, would, be, no, real, difference, between, them, according, to, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, any, theory, of, space, that, implied, that, there, could, be, these, two, possible, universes, must, therefore, be, wrong, newton, took, space, to, be, more, than, relations, between, material, objects, and, based, his, position, on, observation, and, experimentation, for, a, relationist, there, can, be, no, real, difference, between, inertial, motion, in, which, the, object, travels, with, constant, velocity, and, non, inertial, motion, in, which, the, velocity, changes, with, time, since, all, spatial, measurements, are, relative, to, other, objects, and, their, motions, but, newton, argued, that, since, non, inertial, motion, generates, forces, it, must, be, absolute, he, used, the, example, of, water, in, a, spinning, bucket, to, demonstrate, his, argument, water, in, a, bucket, is, hung, from, a, rope, and, set, to, spin, starts, with, a, flat, surface, after, a, while, as, the, bucket, continues, to, spin, the, surface, of, the, water, becomes, concave, if, the, bucket, s, spinning, is, stopped, then, the, surface, of, the, water, remains, concave, as, it, continues, to, spin, the, concave, surface, is, therefore, apparently, not, the, result, of, relative, motion, between, the, bucket, and, the, water, instead, newton, argued, it, must, be, a, result, of, non, inertial, motion, relative, to, space, itself, for, several, centuries, the, bucket, argument, was, considered, decisive, in, showing, that, space, must, exist, independently, of, matter, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, published, his, theory, of, space, as, a, property, of, our, mind, by, which, we, represent, to, ourselves, objects, as, outside, us, and, all, as, in, space, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, on, his, view, the, nature, of, spatial, predicates, are, relations, that, only, attach, to, the, form, of, intuition, alone, and, thus, to, the, subjective, constitution, of, our, mind, without, which, these, predicates, could, not, be, attached, to, anything, at, all, this, develops, his, theory, of, knowledge, in, which, knowledge, about, space, itself, can, be, both, a, priori, and, synthetic, according, to, kant, knowledge, about, space, is, synthetic, because, any, proposition, about, space, cannot, be, true, merely, in, virtue, of, the, meaning, of, the, terms, contained, in, the, proposition, in, the, counter, example, the, proposition, all, unmarried, men, are, bachelors, is, true, by, virtue, of, each, term, s, meaning, further, space, is, a, priori, because, it, is, the, form, of, our, receptive, abilities, to, receive, information, about, the, external, world, for, example, someone, without, sight, can, still, perceive, spatial, attributes, via, touch, hearing, and, smell, knowledge, of, space, itself, is, a, priori, because, it, belongs, to, the, subjective, constitution, of, our, mind, as, the, form, or, manner, of, our, intuition, of, external, objects, euclid, s, elements, contained, five, postulates, that, form, the, basis, for, euclidean, geometry, one, of, these, the, parallel, postulate, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, among, mathematicians, for, many, centuries, it, states, that, on, any, plane, on, which, there, is, a, straight, line, l, 1, and, a, point, p, not, on, l, 1, there, is, exactly, one, straight, line, l, 2, on, the, plane, that, passes, through, the, point, p, and, is, parallel, to, the, straight, line, l, 1, until, the, 19th, century, few, doubted, the, truth, of, the, postulate, instead, debate, centered, over, whether, it, was, necessary, as, an, axiom, or, whether, it, was, a, theory, that, could, be, derived, from, the, other, axioms, around, 1830, though, the, hungarian, j, nos, bolyai, and, the, russian, nikolai, ivanovich, lobachevsky, separately, published, treatises, on, a, type, of, geometry, that, does, not, include, the, parallel, postulate, called, hyperbolic, geometry, in, this, geometry, an, infinite, number, of, parallel, lines, pass, through, the, point, p, consequently, the, sum, of, angles, in, a, triangle, is, less, than, 180, and, the, ratio, of, a, circle, s, circumference, to, its, diameter, is, greater, than, pi, in, the, 1850s, bernhard, riemann, developed, an, equivalent, theory, of, elliptical, geometry, in, which, no, parallel, lines, pass, through, p, in, this, geometry, triangles, have, more, than, 180, and, circles, have, a, ratio, of, circumference, to, diameter, that, is, less, than, pi, although, there, was, a, prevailing, kantian, consensus, at, the, time, once, non, euclidean, geometries, had, been, formalised, some, began, to, wonder, whether, or, not, physical, space, is, curved, carl, friedrich, gauss, a, german, mathematician, was, the, first, to, consider, an, empirical, investigation, of, the, geometrical, structure, of, space, he, thought, of, making, a, test, of, the, sum, of, the, angles, of, an, enormous, stellar, triangle, and, there, are, reports, that, he, actually, carried, out, a, test, on, a, small, scale, by, triangulating, mountain, tops, in, germany, henri, poincar, a, french, mathematician, and, physicist, of, the, late, 19th, century, introduced, an, important, insight, in, which, he, attempted, to, demonstrate, the, futility, of, any, attempt, to, discover, which, geometry, applies, to, space, by, experiment, he, considered, the, predicament, that, would, face, scientists, if, they, were, confined, to, the, surface, of, an, imaginary, large, sphere, with, particular, properties, known, as, a, sphere, world, in, this, world, the, temperature, is, taken, to, vary, in, such, a, way, that, all, objects, expand, and, contract, in, similar, proportions, in, different, places, on, the, sphere, with, a, suitable, falloff, in, temperature, if, the, scientists, try, to, use, measuring, rods, to, determine, the, sum, of, the, angles, in, a, triangle, they, can, be, deceived, into, thinking, that, they, inhabit, a, plane, rather, than, a, spherical, surface, in, fact, the, scientists, cannot, in, principle, determine, whether, they, inhabit, a, plane, or, sphere, and, poincar, argued, the, same, is, true, for, the, debate, over, whether, real, space, is, euclidean, or, not, for, him, which, geometry, was, used, to, describe, space, was, a, matter, of, convention, since, euclidean, geometry, is, simpler, than, non, euclidean, geometry, he, assumed, the, former, would, always, be, used, to, describe, the, true, geometry, of, the, world, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, his, special, theory, of, relativity, which, led, to, the, concept, that, space, and, time, can, be, viewed, as, a, single, construct, known, as, spacetime, in, this, theory, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, the, same, for, all, observers, which, has, the, result, that, two, events, that, appear, simultaneous, to, one, particular, observer, will, not, be, simultaneous, to, another, observer, if, the, observers, are, moving, with, respect, to, one, another, moreover, an, observer, will, measure, a, moving, clock, to, tick, more, slowly, than, one, that, is, stationary, with, respect, to, them, and, objects, are, measured, to, be, shortened, in, the, direction, that, they, are, moving, with, respect, to, the, observer, subsequently, einstein, worked, on, a, general, theory, of, relativity, which, is, a, theory, of, how, gravity, interacts, with, spacetime, instead, of, viewing, gravity, as, a, force, field, acting, in, spacetime, einstein, suggested, that, it, modifies, the, geometric, structure, of, spacetime, itself, according, to, the, general, theory, time, goes, more, slowly, at, places, with, lower, gravitational, potentials, and, rays, of, light, bend, in, the, presence, of, a, gravitational, field, scientists, have, studied, the, behaviour, of, binary, pulsars, confirming, the, predictions, of, einstein, s, theories, and, non, euclidean, geometry, is, usually, used, to, describe, spacetime, in, modern, mathematics, spaces, are, defined, as, sets, with, some, added, structure, they, are, typically, topological, spaces, in, which, a, concept, of, neighbourhood, is, defined, frequently, by, means, of, a, distance, metric, spaces, the, elements, of, a, space, are, often, called, points, but, they, can, have, other, names, such, as, vectors, in, vector, spaces, and, functions, in, function, spaces, space, is, one, of, the, few, fundamental, quantities, in, physics, meaning, that, it, cannot, be, defined, via, other, quantities, because, nothing, more, fundamental, is, known, at, the, present, on, the, other, hand, it, can, be, related, to, other, fundamental, quantities, thus, similar, to, other, fundamental, quantities, like, time, and, mass, space, can, be, explored, via, measurement, and, experiment, today, our, three, dimensional, space, is, viewed, as, embedded, in, a, four, dimensional, spacetime, called, minkowski, space, see, special, relativity, the, idea, behind, spacetime, is, that, time, is, hyperbolic, orthogonal, to, each, of, the, three, spatial, dimensions, before, albert, einstein, s, work, on, relativistic, physics, time, and, space, were, viewed, as, independent, dimensions, einstein, s, discoveries, showed, that, due, to, relativity, of, motion, our, space, and, time, can, be, mathematically, combined, into, one, object, spacetime, it, turns, out, that, distances, in, space, or, in, time, separately, are, not, invariant, with, respect, to, lorentz, coordinate, transformations, but, distances, in, minkowski, space, along, spacetime, intervals, are, which, justifies, the, name, in, addition, time, and, space, dimensions, should, not, be, viewed, as, exactly, equivalent, in, minkowski, space, one, can, freely, move, in, space, but, not, in, time, thus, time, and, space, coordinates, are, treated, differently, both, in, special, relativity, where, time, is, sometimes, considered, an, imaginary, coordinate, and, in, general, relativity, where, different, signs, are, assigned, to, time, and, space, components, of, spacetime, metric, furthermore, in, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, it, is, postulated, that, spacetime, is, geometrically, distorted, curved, near, to, gravitationally, significant, masses, one, consequence, of, this, postulate, which, follows, from, the, equations, of, general, relativity, is, the, prediction, of, moving, ripples, of, spacetime, called, gravitational, waves, while, indirect, evidence, for, these, waves, has, been, found, in, the, motions, of, the, hulse, taylor, binary, system, for, example, experiments, attempting, to, directly, measure, these, waves, are, ongoing, at, the, ligo, and, virgo, collaborations, ligo, scientists, reported, the, first, such, direct, observation, of, gravitational, waves, on, 14, september, 2015, relativity, theory, leads, to, the, cosmological, question, of, what, shape, the, universe, is, and, where, space, came, from, it, appears, that, space, was, created, in, the, big, bang, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, and, has, been, expanding, ever, since, the, overall, shape, of, space, is, not, known, but, space, is, known, to, be, expanding, very, rapidly, due, to, the, cosmic, inflation, the, measurement, of, physical, space, has, long, been, important, although, earlier, societies, had, developed, measuring, systems, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, now, the, most, common, system, of, units, used, in, the, measuring, of, space, and, is, almost, universally, used, currently, the, standard, space, interval, called, a, standard, meter, or, simply, meter, is, defined, as, the, distance, traveled, by, light, in, vacuum, during, a, time, interval, of, exactly, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, this, definition, coupled, with, present, definition, of, the, second, is, based, on, the, special, theory, of, relativity, in, which, the, speed, of, light, plays, the, role, of, a, fundamental, constant, of, nature, geography, is, the, branch, of, science, concerned, with, identifying, and, describing, places, on, earth, utilizing, spatial, awareness, to, try, to, understand, why, things, exist, in, specific, locations, cartography, is, the, mapping, of, spaces, to, allow, better, navigation, for, visualization, purposes, and, to, act, as, a, locational, device, geostatistics, apply, statistical, concepts, to, collected, spatial, data, of, earth, to, create, an, estimate, for, unobserved, phenomena, geographical, space, is, often, considered, as, land, and, can, have, a, relation, to, ownership, usage, in, which, space, is, seen, as, property, or, territory, while, some, cultures, assert, the, rights, of, the, individual, in, terms, of, ownership, other, cultures, will, identify, with, a, communal, approach, to, land, ownership, while, still, other, cultures, such, as, australian, aboriginals, rather, than, asserting, ownership, rights, to, land, invert, the, relationship, and, consider, that, they, are, in, fact, owned, by, the, land, spatial, planning, is, a, method, of, regulating, the, use, of, space, at, land, level, with, decisions, made, at, regional, national, and, international, levels, space, can, also, impact, on, human, and, cultural, behavior, being, an, important, factor, in, architecture, where, it, will, impact, on, the, design, of, buildings, and, structures, and, on, farming, ownership, of, space, is, not, restricted, to, land, ownership, of, airspace, and, of, waters, is, decided, internationally, other, forms, of, ownership, have, been, recently, asserted, to, other, spaces, for, example, to, the, radio, bands, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, or, to, cyberspace, public, space, is, a, term, used, to, define, areas, of, land, as, collectively, owned, by, the, community, and, managed, in, their, name, by, delegated, bodies, such, spaces, are, open, to, all, while, private, property, is, the, land, culturally, owned, by, an, individual, or, company, for, their, own, use, and, pleasure, abstract, space, is, a, term, used, in, geography, to, refer, to, a, hypothetical, space, characterized, by, complete, homogeneity, when, modeling, activity, or, behavior, it, is, a, conceptual, tool, used, to, limit, extraneous, variables, such, as, terrain, psychologists, first, began, to, study, the, way, space, is, perceived, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, those, now, concerned, with, such, studies, regard, it, as, a, distinct, branch, of, psychology, psychologists, analyzing, the, perception, of, space, are, concerned, with, how, recognition, of, an, object, s, physical, appearance, or, its, interactions, are, perceived, see, for, example, visual, space, other, more, specialized, topics, studied, include, amodal, perception, and, object, permanence, the, perception, of, surroundings, is, important, due, to, its, necessary, relevance, to, survival, especially, with, regards, to, hunting, and, self, preservation, as, well, as, simply, one, s, idea, of, personal, space, several, space, related, phobias, have, been, identified, including, agoraphobia, the, fear, of, open, spaces, astrophobia, the, fear, of, celestial, space, and, claustrophobia, the, fear, of, enclosed, spaces, the, understanding, of, three, dimensional, space, in, humans, is, thought, to, be, learned, during, infancy, using, unconscious, inference, and, is, closely, related, to, hand, eye, coordination, the, visual, ability, to, perceive, the, world, in, three, dimensions, is, called, depth, perception, space, has, been, studied, in, the, social, sciences, from, the, perspectives, of, marxism, feminism, postmodernism, postcolonialism, urban, theory, and, critical, geography, these, theories, account, for, the, effect, of, the, history, of, colonialism, transatlantic, slavery, and, globalization, on, our, understanding, and, experience, of, space, and, place, the, topic, has, garnered, attention, since, the, 1980s, after, the, publication, of, henri, lefebvre, s, the, production, of, space, in, this, book, lefebvre, applies, marxist, ideas, about, the, production, of, commodities, and, accumulation, of, capital, to, discuss, space, as, a, social, product, his, focus, is, on, the, multiple, and, overlapping, social, processes, that, produce, space, in, his, book, the, condition, of, postmodernity, david, harvey, describes, what, he, terms, the, time, space, compression, this, is, the, effect, of, technological, advances, and, capitalism, on, our, perception, of, time, space, and, distance, changes, in, the, modes, of, production, and, consumption, of, capital, affect, and, are, affected, by, developments, in, transportation, and, technology, these, advances, create, relationships, across, time, and, space, new, markets, and, groups, of, wealthy, elites, in, urban, centers, all, of, which, annihilate, distances, and, affect, our, perception, of, linearity, and, distance, in, his, book, thirdspace, edward, soja, describes, space, and, spatiality, as, an, integral, and, neglected, aspect, of, what, he, calls, the, trialectics, of, being, the, three, modes, that, determine, how, we, inhabit, experience, and, understand, the, world, he, argues, that, critical, theories, in, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, study, the, historical, and, social, dimensions, of, our, lived, experience, neglecting, the, spatial, dimension, he, builds, on, henri, lefebvre, s, work, to, address, the, dualistic, way, in, which, humans, understand, space, as, either, material, physical, or, as, represented, imagined, lefebvre, s, lived, space, and, soja, s, thirdspace, are, terms, that, account, for, the, complex, ways, in, which, humans, understand, and, navigate, place, which, firstspace, and, secondspace, soja, s, terms, for, material, and, imagined, spaces, respectively, do, not, fully, encompass, postcolonial, theorist, homi, bhabha, s, concept, of, third, space, is, different, from, soja, s, thirdspace, even, though, both, terms, offer, a, way, to, think, outside, the, terms, of, a, binary, logic, bhabha, s, third, space, is, the, space, in, which, hybrid, cultural, forms, and, identities, exist, in, his, theories, the, term, hybrid, describes, new, cultural, forms, that, emerge, through, the, interaction, between, colonizer, and, colonized
