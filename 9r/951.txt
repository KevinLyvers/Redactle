in, mechanics, and, physics, simple, harmonic, motion, sometimes, abbreviated, shm, is, a, special, type, of, periodic, motion, an, object, experiences, by, means, of, a, restoring, force, whose, magnitude, is, directly, proportional, to, the, distance, of, the, object, from, an, equilibrium, position, and, acts, towards, the, equilibrium, position, it, results, in, an, oscillation, that, is, described, by, a, sinusoid, which, continues, indefinitely, if, uninhibited, by, friction, or, any, other, dissipation, of, energy, simple, harmonic, motion, can, serve, as, a, mathematical, model, for, a, variety, of, motions, but, is, typified, by, the, oscillation, of, a, mass, on, a, spring, when, it, is, subject, to, the, linear, elastic, restoring, force, given, by, hooke, s, law, the, motion, is, sinusoidal, in, time, and, demonstrates, a, single, resonant, frequency, other, phenomena, can, be, modeled, by, simple, harmonic, motion, including, the, motion, of, a, simple, pendulum, although, for, it, to, be, an, accurate, model, the, net, force, on, the, object, at, the, end, of, the, pendulum, must, be, proportional, to, the, displacement, and, even, so, it, is, only, a, good, approximation, when, the, angle, of, the, swing, is, small, see, small, angle, approximation, simple, harmonic, motion, can, also, be, used, to, model, molecular, vibration, simple, harmonic, motion, provides, a, basis, for, the, characterization, of, more, complicated, periodic, motion, through, the, techniques, of, fourier, analysis, the, motion, of, a, particle, moving, along, a, straight, line, with, an, acceleration, whose, direction, is, always, towards, a, fixed, point, on, the, line, and, whose, magnitude, is, proportional, to, the, displacement, from, the, fixed, point, is, called, simple, harmonic, motion, in, the, diagram, a, simple, harmonic, oscillator, consisting, of, a, weight, attached, to, one, end, of, a, spring, is, shown, the, other, end, of, the, spring, is, connected, to, a, rigid, support, such, as, a, wall, if, the, system, is, left, at, rest, at, the, equilibrium, position, then, there, is, no, net, force, acting, on, the, mass, however, if, the, mass, is, displaced, from, the, equilibrium, position, the, spring, exerts, a, restoring, elastic, force, that, obeys, hooke, s, law, mathematically, the, restoring, force, f, is, given, by, f, k, x, displaystyle, mathbf, f, k, mathbf, x, where, f, is, the, restoring, elastic, force, exerted, by, the, spring, in, si, units, n, k, is, the, spring, constant, n, m, 1, and, x, is, the, displacement, from, the, equilibrium, position, m, for, any, simple, mechanical, harmonic, oscillator, once, the, mass, is, displaced, from, its, equilibrium, position, it, experiences, a, net, restoring, force, as, a, result, it, accelerates, and, starts, going, back, to, the, equilibrium, position, when, the, mass, moves, closer, to, the, equilibrium, position, the, restoring, force, decreases, at, the, equilibrium, position, the, net, restoring, force, vanishes, however, at, x, 0, the, mass, has, momentum, because, of, the, acceleration, that, the, restoring, force, has, imparted, therefore, the, mass, continues, past, the, equilibrium, position, compressing, the, spring, a, net, restoring, force, then, slows, it, down, until, its, velocity, reaches, zero, whereupon, it, is, accelerated, back, to, the, equilibrium, position, again, as, long, as, the, system, has, no, energy, loss, the, mass, continues, to, oscillate, thus, simple, harmonic, motion, is, a, type, of, periodic, motion, if, energy, is, lost, in, the, system, then, the, mass, exhibits, damped, oscillation, note, if, the, real, space, and, phase, space, plot, are, not, co, linear, the, phase, space, motion, becomes, elliptical, the, area, enclosed, depends, on, the, amplitude, and, the, maximum, momentum, in, newtonian, mechanics, for, one, dimensional, simple, harmonic, motion, the, equation, of, motion, which, is, a, second, order, linear, ordinary, differential, equation, with, constant, coefficients, can, be, obtained, by, means, of, newton, s, 2nd, law, and, hooke, s, law, for, a, mass, on, a, spring, f,

displacement, from, the, equilibrium, or, mean, position, and, k, is, a, constant, the, spring, constant, for, a, mass, on, a, spring, therefore, d, 2, x, d, t, 2, k, m, x, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, 2, x, mathrm, d, t, 2, frac, k, m, x, solving, the, differential, equation, above, produces, a, solution, that, is, a, sinusoidal, function, x, t, c, 1, cos, t, c, 2, sin, t, displaystyle, x, t, c,

can, be, easily, found, setting, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, on, the, equation, above, we, see, that, x, 0, c, 1, displaystyle, x, 0, c, 1, so, that, c, 1, displaystyle, c, 1, is, the, initial, position, of, the, particle, c, 1, x, 0, displaystyle, c, 1, x, 0, taking, the, derivative, of, that, equation, and, evaluating, at, zero, we, get, that, x, 0, c, 2, displaystyle, dot, x, 0, omega, c,

also, be, written, in, the, form, x, t, a, cos, t, displaystyle, x, t, a, cos, left, omega, t, varphi, right, where, or, equivalently, in, the, solution, c, 1, and, c, 2, are, two, constants, determined, by, the, initial, conditions, specifically, the, initial, position, at, time, t, 0, is, c, 1, while, the, initial, velocity, is, c, 2, and, the, origin, is, set, to, be, the, equilibrium, position, each, of, these, constants, carries, a, physical, meaning, of, the, motion, a, is, the, amplitude, maximum, displacement, from, the, equilibrium, position, 2, f, is, the, angular, frequency, and, is, the, initial, phase, using, the, techniques, of, calculus, the, velocity, and, acceleration, as, a, function, of, time, can, be, found, v, t, d, x, d, t, a, sin, t, displaystyle, v, t, frac,

equations, demonstrate, that, the, simple, harmonic, motion, is, isochronous, the, period, and, frequency, are, independent, of, the, amplitude, and, the, initial, phase, of, the, motion, substituting, 2, with, k, m, the, kinetic, energy, k, of, the, system, at, time, t, is, k, t, 1, 2, m, v, 2, t, 1, 2, m, 2, a, 2, sin, 2, t, 1, 2, k, a, 2, sin, 2, t, displaystyle, k, t, tfrac, 1, 2,

of, spring, constant, k, exhibits, simple, harmonic, motion, in, closed, space, the, equation, for, describing, the, period, t, 2, m, k, displaystyle, t, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, m, k, shows, the, period, of, oscillation, is, independent, of, the, amplitude, though, in, practice, the, amplitude, should, be, small, the, above, equation, is, also, valid, in, the, case, when, an, additional, constant, force, is, being, applied, on, the, mass, i, e, the, additional, constant, force, cannot, change, the, period, of, oscillation, simple, harmonic, motion, can, be, considered, the, one, dimensional, projection, of, uniform, circular, motion, if, an, object, moves, with, angular, speed, around, a, circle, of, radius, r, centered, at, the, origin, of, the, xy, plane, then, its, motion, along, each, coordinate, is, simple, harmonic, motion, with, amplitude, r, and, angular, frequency, the, motion, of, a, body, in, which, it, moves, to, and, from, about, a, definite, point, is, also, called, oscillatory, motion, or, vibratory, motion, the, time, period, is, able, to, be, calculated, by, t, 2, l, g, displaystyle, t, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, l, g, where, l, is, the, distance, from, rotation, to, center, of, mass, of, object, undergoing, shm, and, g, being, gravitational, acceleration, this, is, analogous, to, the, mass, spring, system, in, the, small, angle, approximation, the, motion, of, a, simple, pendulum, is, approximated, by, simple, harmonic, motion, the, period, of, a, mass, attached, to, a, pendulum, of, length, l, with, gravitational, acceleration, g, displaystyle, g, is, given, by, t, 2, l, g, displaystyle, t, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, l, g, this, shows, that, the, period, of, oscillation, is, independent, of, the, amplitude, and, mass, of, the, pendulum, but, not, of, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, g, displaystyle, g, therefore, a, pendulum, of, the, same, length, on, the, moon, would, swing, more, slowly, due, to, the, moon, s, lower, gravitational, field, strength, because, the, value, of, g, displaystyle, g, varies, slightly, over, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, time, period, will, vary, slightly, from, place, to, place, and, will, also, vary, with, height, above, sea, level, this, approximation, is, accurate, only, for, small, angles, because, of, the, expression, for, angular, acceleration, being, proportional, to, the, sine, of, the, displacement, angle, m, g, l, sin, i, displaystyle, mgl, sin, theta, i, alpha, where, i, is, the, moment, of, inertia, when, is, small, sin, and, therefore, the, expression, becomes, m, g, l, i, displaystyle, mgl, theta, i, alpha, which, makes, angular, acceleration, directly, proportional, and, opposite, to, satisfying, the, definition, of, simple, harmonic, motion, that, net, force, is, directly, proportional, to, the, displacement, from, the, mean, position, and, is, directed, towards, the, mean, position, a, scotch, yoke, mechanism, can, be, used, to, convert, between, rotational, motion, and, linear, reciprocating, motion, the, linear, motion, can, take, various, forms, depending, on, the, shape, of, the, slot, but, the, basic, yoke, with, a, constant, rotation, speed, produces, a, linear, motion, that, is, simple, harmonic, in, form, x, t, a, sin, t, displaystyle, x, t, a, sin, left, omega, t, varphi, right, where, tan, c, 1, c, 2, displaystyle, tan, varphi, frac,
