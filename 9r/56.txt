the, candela, symbol, cd, is, the, unit, of, luminous, intensity, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, measures, luminous, power, per, unit, solid, angle, emitted, by, a, light, source, in, a, particular, direction, luminous, intensity, is, analogous, to, radiant, intensity, but, instead, of, simply, adding, up, the, contributions, of, every, wavelength, of, light, in, the, source, s, spectrum, the, contribution, of, each, wavelength, is, weighted, by, the, luminous, efficiency, function, the, model, of, the, sensitivity, of, the, human, eye, to, different, wavelengths, standardized, by, the, cie, and, iso, a, common, wax, candle, emits, light, with, a, luminous, intensity, of, roughly, one, candela, if, emission, in, some, directions, is, blocked, by, an, opaque, barrier, the, emission, would, still, be, approximately, one, candela, in, the, directions, that, are, not, obscured, the, word, candela, is, latin, for, candle, the, old, name, candle, is, still, sometimes, used, as, in, foot, candle, and, the, modern, definition, of, candlepower, the, 26th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, redefined, the, candela, in, 2018, the, new, definition, which, took, effect, on, 20, may, 2019, is, the, candela, is, defined, by, taking, the, fixed, numerical, value, of, the, luminous, efficacy, of, monochromatic, radiation, of, frequency, 540, 10, 12, hz, k, cd, to, be, 683, when, expressed, in, the, unit, lm, w, 1, which, is, equal, to, cd, sr, w, 1, or, cd, sr, kg, 1, m, 2, s, 3, where, the, kilogram, metre, and, second, are, defined, in, terms, of, h, c, and, cs, the, frequency, chosen, is, in, the, visible, spectrum, near, green, corresponding, to, a, wavelength, of, about, 555, nanometres, the, human, eye, when, adapted, for, bright, conditions, is, most, sensitive, near, this, frequency, under, these, conditions, photopic, vision, dominates, the, visual, perception, of, our, eyes, over, the, scotopic, vision, at, other, frequencies, more, radiant, intensity, is, required, to, achieve, the, same, luminous, intensity, according, to, the, frequency, response, of, the, human, eye, the, luminous, intensity, for, light, of, a, particular, wavelength, is, given, by, i, v, 683, 002, l, m, w, y, i, e, displaystyle, i, mathrm, v, lambda, 683, 002, mathrm, lm, w, cdot, overline, y, lambda, cdot, i, mathrm, e, lambda, where, i, v, is, the, luminous, intensity, i, e, is, the, radiant, intensity, and, y, textstyle, textstyle, overline, y, lambda, is, the, photopic, luminous, efficiency, function, if, more, than, one, wavelength, is, present, as, is, usually, the, case, one, must, integrate, over, the, spectrum, of, wavelengths, to, get, the, total, luminous, intensity, prior, to, 1948, various, standards, for, luminous, intensity, were, in, use, in, a, number, of, countries, these, were, typically, based, on, the, brightness, of, the, flame, from, a, standard, candle, of, defined, composition, or, the, brightness, of, an, incandescent, filament, of, specific, design, one, of, the, best, known, of, these, was, the, english, standard, of, candlepower, one, candlepower, was, the, light, produced, by, a, pure, spermaceti, candle, weighing, one, sixth, of, a, pound, and, burning, at, a, rate, of, 120, grains, per, hour, germany, austria, and, scandinavia, used, the, hefnerkerze, a, unit, based, on, the, output, of, a, hefner, lamp, a, better, standard, for, luminous, intensity, was, needed, in, 1884, jules, violle, had, proposed, a, standard, based, on, the, light, emitted, by, 1, cm, 2, of, platinum, at, its, melting, point, or, freezing, point, the, resulting, unit, of, intensity, called, the, violle, was, roughly, equal, to, 60, english, candlepower, platinum, was, convenient, for, this, purpose, because, it, had, a, high, enough, melting, point, was, not, prone, to, oxidation, and, could, be, obtained, in, pure, form, violle, showed, that, the, intensity, emitted, by, pure, platinum, was, strictly, dependent, on, its, temperature, and, so, platinum, at, its, melting, point, should, have, a, consistent, luminous, intensity, in, practice, realizing, a, standard, based, on, violle, s, proposal, turned, out, to, be, more, difficult, than, expected, impurities, on, the, surface, of, the, platinum, could, directly, affect, its, emissivity, and, in, addition, impurities, could, affect, the, luminous, intensity, by, altering, the, melting, point, over, the, following, half, century, various, scientists, tried, to, make, a, practical, intensity, standard, based, on, incandescent, platinum, the, successful, approach, was, to, suspend, a, hollow, shell, of, thorium, dioxide, with, a, small, hole, in, it, in, a, bath, of, molten, platinum, the, shell, cavity, serves, as, a, black, body, producing, black, body, radiation, that, depends, on, the, temperature, and, is, not, sensitive, to, details, of, how, the, device, is, constructed, in, 1937, the, commission, internationale, de, l, clairage, international, commission, on, illumination, and, the, cipm, proposed, a, new, candle, based, on, this, concept, with, value, chosen, to, make, it, similar, to, the, earlier, unit, candlepower, the, decision, was, promulgated, by, the, cipm, in, 1946, the, value, of, the, new, candle, is, such, that, the, brightness, of, the, full, radiator, at, the, temperature, of, solidification, of, platinum, is, 60, new, candles, per, square, centimetre, it, was, then, ratified, in, 1948, by, the, 9th, cgpm, which, adopted, a, new, name, for, this, unit, the, candela, in, 1967, the, 13th, cgpm, removed, the, term, new, candle, and, gave, an, amended, version, of, the, candela, definition, specifying, the, atmospheric, pressure, applied, to, the, freezing, platinum, the, candela, is, the, luminous, intensity, in, the, perpendicular, direction, of, a, surface, of, 1, 600, 000, square, metre, of, a, black, body, at, the, temperature, of, freezing, platinum, under, a, pressure, of, 101, 325, newtons, per, square, metre, in, 1979, because, of, the, difficulties, in, realizing, a, planck, radiator, at, high, temperatures, and, the, new, possibilities, offered, by, radiometry, the, 16th, cgpm, adopted, a, new, definition, of, the, candela, the, candela, is, the, luminous, intensity, in, a, given, direction, of, a, source, that, emits, monochromatic, radiation, of, frequency, 540, 10, 12, hertz, and, that, has, a, radiant, intensity, in, that, direction, of, 1, 683, watt, per, steradian, the, definition, describes, how, to, produce, a, light, source, that, by, definition, emits, one, candela, but, does, not, specify, the, luminous, efficiency, function, for, weighting, radiation, at, other, frequencies, such, a, source, could, then, be, used, to, calibrate, instruments, designed, to, measure, luminous, intensity, with, reference, to, a, specified, luminous, efficiency, function, an, appendix, to, the, si, brochure, makes, it, clear, that, the, luminous, efficiency, function, is, not, uniquely, specified, but, must, be, selected, to, fully, define, the, candela, the, arbitrary, 1, 683, term, was, chosen, so, that, the, new, definition, would, precisely, match, the, old, definition, although, the, candela, is, now, defined, in, terms, of, the, second, an, si, base, unit, and, the, watt, a, derived, si, unit, the, candela, remains, a, base, unit, of, the, si, system, by, definition, the, 26th, cgpm, approved, the, modern, definition, of, the, candela, in, 2018, as, part, of, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, which, redefined, the, si, base, units, in, terms, of, fundamental, physical, constants, if, a, source, emits, a, known, luminous, intensity, i, v, in, candelas, in, a, well, defined, cone, the, total, luminous, flux, v, in, lumens, is, given, by, v, i, v, 2, 1, cos, a, 2, displaystyle, phi, mathrm, v, i, mathrm, v, 2, pi, where, a, is, the, radiation, angle, of, the, lamp, the, full, vertex, angle, of, the, emission, cone, for, example, a, lamp, that, emits, 590, cd, with, a, radiation, angle, of, 40, emits, about, 224, lumens, see, mr16, for, emission, angles, of, some, common, lamps, if, the, source, emits, light, uniformly, in, all, directions, the, flux, can, be, found, by, multiplying, the, intensity, by, 4, a, uniform, 1, candela, source, emits, 12, 6, lumens, for, the, purpose, of, measuring, illumination, the, candela, is, not, a, practical, unit, as, it, only, applies, to, idealized, point, light, sources, each, approximated, by, a, source, small, compared, to, the, distance, from, which, its, luminous, radiation, is, measured, also, assuming, that, it, is, done, so, in, the, absence, of, other, light, sources, what, gets, directly, measured, by, a, light, meter, is, incident, light, on, a, sensor, of, finite, area, i, e, illuminance, in, lm, m, 2, lux, however, if, designing, illumination, from, many, point, light, sources, like, light, bulbs, of, known, approximate, omnidirectionally, uniform, intensities, the, contributions, to, illuminance, from, incoherent, light, being, additive, it, is, mathematically, estimated, as, follows, if, r, i, is, the, position, of, the, i, th, source, of, uniform, intensity, i, i, and, is, the, unit, vector, normal, to, the, illuminated, elemental, opaque, area, da, being, measured, and, provided, that, all, light, sources, lie, in, the, same, half, space, divided, by, the, plane, of, this, area, illuminance, at, point, r, on, d, a, e, v, r, i, a, r, r, i, r, r, i, 3, i, i, displaystyle, text,

other, si, units, the, candela, can, also, be, modified, by, adding, a, metric, prefix, that, multiplies, it, by, a, power, of, 10, for, example, millicandela, mcd, for, 10, 3, candela
