citric, acid, is, an, organic, compound, with, the, skeletal, formula, h, o, c, co, 2, h, ch, 2, co, 2, h, 2, it, is, a, colorless, weak, organic, acid, it, occurs, naturally, in, citrus, fruits, in, biochemistry, it, is, an, intermediate, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, which, occurs, in, the, metabolism, of, all, aerobic, organisms, more, than, two, million, tons, of, citric, acid, are, manufactured, every, year, it, is, used, widely, as, an, acidifier, as, a, flavoring, and, a, chelating, agent, a, citrate, is, a, derivative, of, citric, acid, that, is, the, salts, esters, and, the, polyatomic, anion, found, in, solutions, and, salts, of, citric, acid, an, example, of, the, former, a, salt, is, trisodium, citrate, an, ester, is, triethyl, citrate, when, citrate, trianion, is, part, of, a, salt, the, formula, of, the, citrate, trianion, is, written, as, c, 6, h, 5, o, 3, 7, or, c, 3, h, 5, o, coo, 3, 3, citric, acid, occurs, in, a, variety, of, fruits, and, vegetables, most, notably, citrus, fruits, lemons, and, limes, have, particularly, high, concentrations, of, the, acid, it, can, constitute, as, much, as, 8, of, the, dry, weight, of, these, fruits, about, 47, g, l, in, the, juices, the, concentrations, of, citric, acid, in, citrus, fruits, range, from, 0, 005, mol, l, for, oranges, and, grapefruits, to, 0, 30, mol, l, in, lemons, and, limes, these, values, vary, within, species, depending, upon, the, cultivar, and, the, circumstances, under, which, the, fruit, was, grown, citric, acid, was, first, isolated, in, 1784, by, the, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, who, crystallized, it, from, lemon, juice, industrial, scale, citric, acid, production, first, began, in, 1890, based, on, the, italian, citrus, fruit, industry, where, the, juice, was, treated, with, hydrated, lime, calcium, hydroxide, to, precipitate, calcium, citrate, which, was, isolated, and, converted, back, to, the, acid, using, diluted, sulfuric, acid, in, 1893, c, wehmer, discovered, penicillium, mold, could, produce, citric, acid, from, sugar, however, microbial, production, of, citric, acid, did, not, become, industrially, important, until, world, war, i, disrupted, italian, citrus, exports, in, 1917, american, food, chemist, james, currie, discovered, that, certain, strains, of, the, mold, aspergillus, niger, could, be, efficient, citric, acid, producers, and, the, pharmaceutical, company, pfizer, began, industrial, level, production, using, this, technique, two, years, later, followed, by, citrique, belge, in, 1929, in, this, production, technique, which, is, still, the, major, industrial, route, to, citric, acid, used, today, cultures, of, aspergillus, niger, are, fed, on, a, sucrose, or, glucose, containing, medium, to, produce, citric, acid, the, source, of, sugar, is, corn, steep, liquor, molasses, hydrolyzed, corn, starch, or, other, inexpensive, carbohydrate, solution, after, the, mold, is, filtered, out, of, the, resulting, suspension, citric, acid, is, isolated, by, precipitating, it, with, calcium, hydroxide, to, yield, calcium, citrate, salt, from, which, citric, acid, is, regenerated, by, treatment, with, sulfuric, acid, as, in, the, direct, extraction, from, citrus, fruit, juice, in, 1977, a, patent, was, granted, to, lever, brothers, for, the, chemical, synthesis, of, citric, acid, starting, either, from, aconitic, or, isocitrate, also, called, alloisocitrate, calcium, salts, under, high, pressure, conditions, this, produced, citric, acid, in, near, quantitative, conversion, under, what, appeared, to, be, a, reverse, non, enzymatic, krebs, cycle, reaction, global, production, was, in, excess, of, 2, 000, 000, tons, in, 2018, more, than, 50, of, this, volume, was, produced, in, china, more, than, 50, was, used, as, an, acidity, regulator, in, beverages, some, 20, in, other, food, applications, 20, for, detergent, applications, and, 10, for, applications, other, than, food, such, as, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and, in, the, chemical, industry, citric, acid, can, be, obtained, as, an, anhydrous, water, free, form, or, as, a, monohydrate, the, anhydrous, form, crystallizes, from, hot, water, while, the, monohydrate, forms, when, citric, acid, is, crystallized, from, cold, water, the, monohydrate, can, be, converted, to, the, anhydrous, form, at, about, 78, c, citric, acid, also, dissolves, in, absolute, anhydrous, ethanol, 76, parts, of, citric, acid, per, 100, parts, of, ethanol, at, 15, c, it, decomposes, with, loss, of, carbon, dioxide, above, about, 175, c, citric, acid, is, a, tribasic, acid, with, pk, a, values, extrapolated, to, zero, ionic, strength, of, 3, 128, 4, 761, and, 6, 396, at, 25, c, the, pk, a, of, the, hydroxyl, group, has, been, found, by, means, of, 13, c, nmr, spectroscopy, to, be, 14, 4, the, speciation, diagram, shows, that, solutions, of, citric, acid, are, buffer, solutions, between, about, ph, 2, and, ph, 8, in, biological, systems, around, ph, 7, the, two, species, present, are, the, citrate, ion, and, mono, hydrogen, citrate, ion, the, ssc, 20x, hybridization, buffer, is, an, example, in, common, use, tables, compiled, for, biochemical, studies, are, available, conversely, the, ph, of, a, 1, mm, solution, of, citric, acid, will, be, about, 3, 2, the, ph, of, fruit, juices, from, citrus, fruits, like, oranges, and, lemons, depends, on, the, citric, acid, concentration, with, a, higher, concentration, of, citric, acid, resulting, in, a, lower, ph, acid, salts, of, citric, acid, can, be, prepared, by, careful, adjustment, of, the, ph, before, crystallizing, the, compound, see, for, example, sodium, citrate, the, citrate, ion, forms, complexes, with, metallic, cations, the, stability, constants, for, the, formation, of, these, complexes, are, quite, large, because, of, the, chelate, effect, consequently, it, forms, complexes, even, with, alkali, metal, cations, however, when, a, chelate, complex, is, formed, using, all, three, carboxylate, groups, the, chelate, rings, have, 7, and, 8, members, which, are, generally, less, stable, thermodynamically, than, smaller, chelate, rings, in, consequence, the, hydroxyl, group, can, be, deprotonated, forming, part, of, a, more, stable, 5, membered, ring, as, in, ammonium, ferric, citrate, 5, fe, 3, c, 6, h, 4, o, 4, 7, 2, 2h, 2, o, citric, acid, can, be, esterified, at, one, or, more, of, its, three, carboxylic, acid, groups, to, form, any, of, a, variety, of, mono, di, tri, and, mixed, esters, citrate, is, an, intermediate, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, also, known, as, the, tca, t, ri, c, arboxylic, a, cid, cycle, or, the, krebs, cycle, a, central, metabolic, pathway, for, animals, plants, and, bacteria, citrate, synthase, catalyzes, the, condensation, of, oxaloacetate, with, acetyl, coa, to, form, citrate, citrate, then, acts, as, the, substrate, for, aconitase, and, is, converted, into, aconitic, acid, the, cycle, ends, with, regeneration, of, oxaloacetate, this, series, of, chemical, reactions, is, the, source, of, two, thirds, of, the, food, derived, energy, in, higher, organisms, the, chemical, energy, released, is, available, under, the, form, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, hans, adolf, krebs, received, the, 1953, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, the, discovery, citrate, can, be, transported, out, of, the, mitochondria, and, into, the, cytoplasm, then, broken, down, into, acetyl, coa, for, fatty, acid, synthesis, and, into, oxaloacetate, citrate, is, a, positive, modulator, of, this, conversion, and, allosterically, regulates, the, enzyme, acetyl, coa, carboxylase, which, is, the, regulating, enzyme, in, the, conversion, of, acetyl, coa, into, malonyl, coa, the, commitment, step, in, fatty, acid, synthesis, in, short, citrate, is, transported, into, the, cytoplasm, converted, into, acetyl, coa, which, is, then, converted, into, malonyl, coa, by, acetyl, coa, carboxylase, which, is, allosterically, modulated, by, citrate, high, concentrations, of, cytosolic, citrate, can, inhibit, phosphofructokinase, the, catalyst, of, a, rate, limiting, step, of, glycolysis, this, effect, is, advantageous, high, concentrations, of, citrate, indicate, that, there, is, a, large, supply, of, biosynthetic, precursor, molecules, so, there, is, no, need, for, phosphofructokinase, to, continue, to, send, molecules, of, its, substrate, fructose, 6, phosphate, into, glycolysis, citrate, acts, by, augmenting, the, inhibitory, effect, of, high, concentrations, of, atp, another, sign, that, there, is, no, need, to, carry, out, glycolysis, citrate, is, a, vital, component, of, bone, helping, to, regulate, the, size, of, apatite, crystals, because, it, is, one, of, the, stronger, edible, acids, the, dominant, use, of, citric, acid, is, as, a, flavoring, and, preservative, in, food, and, beverages, especially, soft, drinks, and, candies, within, the, european, union, it, is, denoted, by, e, number, e330, citrate, salts, of, various, metals, are, used, to, deliver, those, minerals, in, a, biologically, available, form, in, many, dietary, supplements, citric, acid, has,
