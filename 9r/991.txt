newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, says, that, every, particle, attracts, every, other, particle, in, the, universe, with, a, force, that, is, proportional, to, the, product, of, their, masses, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, their, centers, separated, objects, attract, and, are, attracted, as, if, all, their, mass, were, concentrated, at, their, centers, the, publication, of, the, law, has, become, known, as, the, first, great, unification, as, it, marked, the, unification, of, the, previously, described, phenomena, of, gravity, on, earth, with, known, astronomical, behaviors, this, is, a, general, physical, law, derived, from, empirical, observations, by, what, isaac, newton, called, inductive, reasoning, it, is, a, part, of, classical, mechanics, and, was, formulated, in, newton, s, work, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, the, principia, first, published, on, 5, july, 1687, the, equation, for, universal, gravitation, thus, takes, the, form, where, f, is, the, gravitational, force, acting, between, two, objects, m, 1, and, m, 2, are, the, masses, of, the, objects, r, is, the, distance, between, the, centers, of, their, masses, and, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, the, first, test, of, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, between, masses, in, the, laboratory, was, the, cavendish, experiment, conducted, by, the, british, scientist, henry, cavendish, in, 1798, it, took, place, 111, years, after, the, publication, of, newton, s, principia, and, approximately, 71, years, after, his, death, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, resembles, coulomb, s, law, of, electrical, forces, which, is, used, to, calculate, the, magnitude, of, the, electrical, force, arising, between, two, charged, bodies, both, are, inverse, square, laws, where, force, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, the, bodies, coulomb, s, law, has, charge, in, place, of, mass, and, a, different, constant, newton, s, law, has, later, been, superseded, by, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, but, the, universality, of, the, gravitational, constant, is, intact, and, the, law, still, continues, to, be, used, as, an, excellent, approximation, of, the, effects, of, gravity, in, most, applications, relativity, is, required, only, when, there, is, a, need, for, extreme, accuracy, or, when, dealing, with, very, strong, gravitational, fields, such, as, those, found, near, extremely, massive, and, dense, objects, or, at, small, distances, such, as, mercury, s, orbit, around, the, sun, around, 1600, the, scientific, method, began, to, take, root, ren, descartes, started, over, with, a, more, fundamental, view, developing, ideas, of, matter, and, action, independent, of, theology, galileo, galilei, wrote, about, experimental, measurements, of, falling, and, rolling, objects, johannes, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, summarized, tycho, brahe, s, astronomical, observations, 132, around, 1666, isaac, newton, developed, the, idea, that, kepler, s, laws, must, also, apply, to, the, orbit, of, the, moon, around, the, earth, and, then, to, all, objects, on, earth, the, analysis, required, assuming, that, the, gravitation, force, acted, as, if, all, of, the, mass, of, the, earth, were, concentrated, at, its, center, an, unproven, conjecture, at, that, time, his, calculations, of, the, moon, orbit, time, was, within, 16, of, the, known, value, by, 1680, new, values, for, the, diameter, of, the, earth, improved, his, orbit, time, to, within, 1, 6, but, more, importantly, newton, had, found, a, proof, of, his, earlier, conjecture, 201, in, 1687, newton, published, his, principia, which, combined, his, laws, of, motion, with, new, mathematical, analysis, to, explain, kepler, s, empirical, results, 134, his, explanation, was, in, the, form, of, a, law, of, universal, gravitation, any, two, bodies, are, attracted, by, a, force, proportional, to, their, mass, and, inversely, proportional, to, their, separation, squared, 28, newton, s, original, formula, was, where, the, symbol, displaystyle, propto, means, is, proportional, to, to, make, this, into, an, equal, sided, formula, or, equation, there, needed, to, be, a, multiplying, factor, or, constant, that, would, give, the, correct, force, of, gravity, no, matter, the, value, of, the, masses, or, distance, between, them, the, gravitational, constant, newton, would, need, an, accurate, measure, of, this, constant, to, prove, his, inverse, square, law, when, newton, presented, book, 1, of, the, unpublished, text, in, april, 1686, to, the, royal, society, robert, hooke, made, a, claim, that, newton, had, obtained, the, inverse, square, law, from, him, ultimately, a, frivolous, accusation, 204, while, newton, was, able, to, formulate, his, law, of, gravity, in, his, monumental, work, he, was, deeply, uncomfortable, with, the, notion, of, action, at, a, distance, that, his, equations, implied, in, 1692, in, his, third, letter, to, bentley, he, wrote, that, one, body, may, act, upon, another, at, a, distance, through, a, vacuum, without, the, mediation, of, anything, else, by, and, through, which, their, action, and, force, may, be, conveyed, from, one, another, is, to, me, so, great, an, absurdity, that, i, believe, no, man, who, has, in, philosophic, matters, a, competent, faculty, of, thinking, could, ever, fall, into, it, he, never, in, his, words, assigned, the, cause, of, this, power, in, all, other, cases, he, used, the, phenomenon, of, motion, to, explain, the, origin, of, various, forces, acting, on, bodies, but, in, the, case, of, gravity, he, was, unable, to, experimentally, identify, the, motion, that, produces, the, force, of, gravity, although, he, invented, two, mechanical, hypotheses, in, 1675, and, 1717, moreover, he, refused, to, even, offer, a, hypothesis, as, to, the, cause, of, this, force, on, grounds, that, to, do, so, was, contrary, to, sound, science, he, lamented, that, philosophers, have, hitherto, attempted, the, search, of, nature, in, vain, for, the, source, of, the, gravitational, force, as, he, was, convinced, by, many, reasons, that, there, were, causes, hitherto, unknown, that, were, fundamental, to, all, the, phenomena, of, nature, these, fundamental, phenomena, are, still, under, investigation, and, though, hypotheses, abound, the, definitive, answer, has, yet, to, be, found, and, in, newton, s, 1713, general, scholium, in, the, second, edition, of, principia, i, have, not, yet, been, able, to, discover, the, cause, of, these, properties, of, gravity, from, phenomena, and, i, feign, no, hypotheses, it, is, enough, that, gravity, does, really, exist, and, acts, according, to, the, laws, i, have, explained, and, that, it, abundantly, serves, to, account, for, all, the, motions, of, celestial, bodies, in, modern, language, the, law, states, the, following, where, assuming, si, units, f, is, measured, in, newtons, n, m, 1, and, m, 2, in, kilograms, kg, r, in, meters, m, and, the, constant, g, is, 6, 674, 30, 15, 10, 11, m, 3, kg, 1, s, 2, the, value, of, the, constant, g, was, first, accurately, determined, from, the, results, of, the, cavendish, experiment, conducted, by, the, british, scientist, henry, cavendish, in, 1798, although, cavendish, did, not, himself, calculate, a, numerical, value, for, g, this, experiment, was, also, the, first, test, of, newton, s, theory, of, gravitation, between, masses, in, the, laboratory, it, took, place, 111, years, after, the, publication, of, newton, s, principia, and, 71, years, after, newton, s, death, so, none, of, newton, s, calculations, could, use, the, value, of, g, instead, he, could, only, calculate, a, force, relative, to, another, force, if, the, bodies, in, question, have, spatial, extent, as, opposed, to, being, point, masses, then, the, gravitational, force, between, them, is, calculated, by, summing, the, contributions, of, the, notional, point, masses, that, constitute, the, bodies, in, the, limit, as, the, component, point, masses, become, infinitely, small, this, entails, integrating, the, force, in, vector, form, see, below, over, the, extents, of, the, two, bodies, in, this, way, it, can, be, shown, that, an, object, with, a, spherically, symmetric, distribution, of, mass, exerts, the, same, gravitational, attraction, on, external, bodies, as, if, all, the, object, s, mass, were, concentrated, at, a, point, at, its, center, this, is, not, generally, true, for, non, spherically, symmetrical, bodies, for, points, inside, a, spherically, symmetric, distribution, of, matter, newton, s, shell, theorem, can, be, used, to, find, the, gravitational, force, the, theorem, tells, us, how, different, parts, of, the, mass, distribution, affect, the, gravitational, force, measured, at, a, point, located, a, distance, r, 0, from, the, center, of, the, mass, distribution, as, a, consequence, for, example, within, a, shell, of, uniform, thickness, and, density, there, is, no, net, gravitational, acceleration, anywhere, within, the, hollow, sphere, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, can, be, written, as, a, vector, equation, to, account, for, the, direction, of, the, gravitational, force, as, well, as, its, magnitude, in, this, formula, quantities, in, bold, represent, vectors, f, 21, g, m, 1, m, 2, r, 21, 2, r, 21, g, m, 1, m, 2, r, 21, 3, r, 21, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 21, g, m, 1, m, 2, over, mathbf, r, 21, 2, hat, mathbf, r, 21, g, m, 1, m, 2, over, mathbf, r, 21, 3, mathbf, r, 21, where, it, can, be, seen, that, the, vector, form, of, the, equation, is, the, same, as, the, scalar, form, given, earlier, except, that, f, is, now, a, vector, quantity, and, the, right, hand, side, is, multiplied, by, the, appropriate, unit, vector, also, it, can, be, seen, that, f, 12, f, 21, the, gravitational, field, is, a, vector, field, that, describes, the, gravitational, force, that, would, be, applied, on, an, object, in, any, given, point, in, space, per, unit, mass, it, is, actually, equal, to, the, gravitational, acceleration, at, that, point, it, is, a, generalisation, of, the, vector, form, which, becomes, particularly, useful, if, more, than, two, objects, are, involved, such, as, a, rocket, between, the, earth, and, the, moon, for, two, objects, e, g, object, 2, is, a, rocket, object, 1, the, earth, we, simply, write, r, instead, of, r, 12, and, m, instead, of, m, 2, and, define, the, gravitational, field, g, r, as, so, that, we, can, write, this, formulation, is, dependent, on, the, objects, causing, the, field, the, field, has, units, of, acceleration, in, si, this, is, m, s, 2, gravitational, fields, are, also, conservative, that, is, the, work, done, by, gravity, from, one, position, to, another, is, path, independent, this, has, the, consequence, that, there, exists, a, gravitational, potential, field, v, r, such, that, if, m, 1, is, a, point, mass, or, the, mass, of, a, sphere, with, homogeneous, mass, distribution, the, force, field, g, r, outside, the, sphere, is, isotropic, i, e, depends, only, on, the, distance, r, from, the, center, of, the, sphere, in, that, case, as, per, gauss, s, law, field, in, a, symmetric, body, can, be, found, by, the, mathematical, equation, where, v, displaystyle, partial, v, is, a, closed, surface, and, m, enc, displaystyle, m, text, enc, is, the, mass, enclosed, by, the, surface, hence, for, a, hollow, sphere, of, radius, r, displaystyle, r, and, total, mass, m, displaystyle, m, for, a, uniform, solid, sphere, of, radius, r, displaystyle, r, and, total, mass, m, displaystyle, m, newton, s, description, of, gravity, is, sufficiently, accurate, for, many, practical, purposes, and, is, therefore, widely, used, deviations, from, it, are, small, when, the, dimensionless, quantities, c, 2, displaystyle, phi, c, 2, and, v, c, 2, displaystyle, v, c, 2, are, both, much, less, than, one, where, displaystyle, phi, is, the, gravitational, potential, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, velocity, of, the, objects, being, studied, and, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, for, example, newtonian, gravity, provides, an, accurate, description, of, the, earth, sun, system, since, where, r, orbit, displaystyle, r, text, orbit, is, the, radius, of, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, in, situations, where, either, dimensionless, parameter, is, large, then, general, relativity, must, be, used, to, describe, the, system, general, relativity, reduces, to, newtonian, gravity, in, the, limit, of, small, potential, and, low, velocities, so, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, is, often, said, to, be, the, low, gravity, limit, of, general, relativity, the, first, two, conflicts, with, observations, above, were, explained, by, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, in, which, gravitation, is, a, manifestation, of, curved, spacetime, instead, of, being, due, to, a, force, propagated, between, bodies, in, einstein, s, theory, energy, and, momentum, distort, spacetime, in, their, vicinity, and, other, particles, move, in, trajectories, determined, by, the, geometry, of, spacetime, this, allowed, a, description, of, the, motions, of, light, and, mass, that, was, consistent, with, all, available, observations, in, general, relativity, the, gravitational, force, is, a, fictitious, force, resulting, from, the, curvature, of, spacetime, because, the, gravitational, acceleration, of, a, body, in, free, fall, is, due, to, its, world, line, being, a, geodesic, of, spacetime, in, recent, years, quests, for, non, inverse, square, terms, in, the, law, of, gravity, have, been, carried, out, by, neutron, interferometry, the, n, body, problem, is, an, ancient, classical, problem, of, predicting, the, individual, motions, of, a, group, of, celestial, objects, interacting, with, each, other, gravitationally, solving, this, problem, from, the, time, of, the, greeks, and, on, has, been, motivated, by, the, desire, to, understand, the, motions, of, the, sun, planets, and, the, visible, stars, in, the, 20th, century, understanding, the, dynamics, of, globular, cluster, star, systems, became, an, important, n, body, problem, too, the, n, body, problem, in, general, relativity, is, considerably, more, difficult, to, solve, the, classical, physical, problem, can, be, informally, stated, as, given, the, quasi, steady, orbital, properties, instantaneous, position, velocity, and, time, of, a, group, of, celestial, bodies, predict, their, interactive, forces, and, consequently, predict, their, true, orbital, motions, for, all, future, times, the, two, body, problem, has, been, completely, solved, as, has, the, restricted, three, body, problem
