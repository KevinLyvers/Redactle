astrophysics, is, a, science, that, employs, the, methods, and, principles, of, physics, and, chemistry, in, the, study, of, astronomical, objects, and, phenomena, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, discipline, james, keeler, said, astrophysics, seeks, to, ascertain, the, nature, of, the, heavenly, bodies, rather, than, their, positions, or, motions, in, space, what, they, are, rather, than, where, they, are, which, is, studied, in, celestial, mechanics, among, the, subjects, studied, are, the, sun, solar, physics, other, stars, galaxies, extrasolar, planets, the, interstellar, medium, and, the, cosmic, microwave, background, emissions, from, these, objects, are, examined, across, all, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, the, properties, examined, include, luminosity, density, temperature, and, chemical, composition, because, astrophysics, is, a, very, broad, subject, astrophysicists, apply, concepts, and, methods, from, many, disciplines, of, physics, including, classical, mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical, mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum, mechanics, relativity, nuclear, and, particle, physics, and, atomic, and, molecular, physics, in, practice, modern, astronomical, research, often, involves, a, substantial, amount, of, work, in, the, realms, of, theoretical, and, observational, physics, some, areas, of, study, for, astrophysicists, include, their, attempts, to, determine, the, properties, of, dark, matter, dark, energy, black, holes, and, other, celestial, bodies, and, the, origin, and, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, topics, also, studied, by, theoretical, astrophysicists, include, solar, system, formation, and, evolution, stellar, dynamics, and, evolution, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, magnetohydrodynamics, large, scale, structure, of, matter, in, the, universe, origin, of, cosmic, rays, general, relativity, special, relativity, quantum, and, physical, cosmology, the, physical, study, of, the, largest, scale, structures, of, the, universe, including, string, cosmology, and, astroparticle, physics, astronomy, is, an, ancient, science, long, separated, from, the, study, of, terrestrial, physics, in, the, aristotelian, worldview, bodies, in, the, sky, appeared, to, be, unchanging, spheres, whose, only, motion, was, uniform, motion, in, a, circle, while, the, earthly, world, was, the, realm, which, underwent, growth, and, decay, and, in, which, natural, motion, was, in, a, straight, line, and, ended, when, the, moving, object, reached, its, goal, consequently, it, was, held, that, the, celestial, region, was, made, of, a, fundamentally, different, kind, of, matter, from, that, found, in, the, terrestrial, sphere, either, fire, as, maintained, by, plato, or, aether, as, maintained, by, aristotle, during, the, 17th, century, natural, philosophers, such, as, galileo, descartes, and, newton, began, to, maintain, that, the, celestial, and, terrestrial, regions, were, made, of, similar, kinds, of, material, and, were, subject, to, the, same, natural, laws, their, challenge, was, that, the, tools, had, not, yet, been, invented, with, which, to, prove, these, assertions, for, much, of, the, nineteenth, century, astronomical, research, was, focused, on, the, routine, work, of, measuring, the, positions, and, computing, the, motions, of, astronomical, objects, a, new, astronomy, soon, to, be, called, astrophysics, began, to, emerge, when, william, hyde, wollaston, and, joseph, von, fraunhofer, independently, discovered, that, when, decomposing, the, light, from, the, sun, a, multitude, of, dark, lines, regions, where, there, was, less, or, no, light, were, observed, in, the, spectrum, by, 1860, the, physicist, gustav, kirchhoff, and, the, chemist, robert, bunsen, had, demonstrated, that, the, dark, lines, in, the, solar, spectrum, corresponded, to, bright, lines, in, the, spectra, of, known, gases, specific, lines, corresponding, to, unique, chemical, elements, kirchhoff, deduced, that, the, dark, lines, in, the, solar, spectrum, are, caused, by, absorption, by, chemical, elements, in, the, solar, atmosphere, in, this, way, it, was, proved, that, the, chemical, elements, found, in, the, sun, and, stars, were, also, found, on, earth, among, those, who, extended, the, study, of, solar, and, stellar, spectra, was, norman, lockyer, who, in, 1868, detected, radiant, as, well, as, dark, lines, in, solar, spectra, working, with, chemist, edward, frankland, to, investigate, the, spectra, of, elements, at, various, temperatures, and, pressures, he, could, not, associate, a, yellow, line, in, the, solar, spectrum, with, any, known, elements, he, thus, claimed, the, line, represented, a, new, element, which, was, called, helium, after, the, greek, helios, the, sun, personified, in, 1885, edward, c, pickering, undertook, an, ambitious, program, of, stellar, spectral, classification, at, harvard, college, observatory, in, which, a, team, of, woman, computers, notably, williamina, fleming, antonia, maury, and, annie, jump, cannon, classified, the, spectra, recorded, on, photographic, plates, by, 1890, a, catalog, of, over, 10, 000, stars, had, been, prepared, that, grouped, them, into, thirteen, spectral, types, following, pickering, s, vision, by, 1924, cannon, expanded, the, catalog, to, nine, volumes, and, over, a, quarter, of, a, million, stars, developing, the, harvard, classification, scheme, which, was, accepted, for, worldwide, use, in, 1922, in, 1895, george, ellery, hale, and, james, e, keeler, along, with, a, group, of, ten, associate, editors, from, europe, and, the, united, states, established, the, astrophysical, journal, an, international, review, of, spectroscopy, and, astronomical, physics, it, was, intended, that, the, journal, would, fill, the, gap, between, journals, in, astronomy, and, physics, providing, a, venue, for, publication, of, articles, on, astronomical, applications, of, the, spectroscope, on, laboratory, research, closely, allied, to, astronomical, physics, including, wavelength, determinations, of, metallic, and, gaseous, spectra, and, experiments, on, radiation, and, absorption, on, theories, of, the, sun, moon, planets, comets, meteors, and, nebulae, and, on, instrumentation, for, telescopes, and, laboratories, around, 1920, following, the, discovery, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, still, used, as, the, basis, for, classifying, stars, and, their, evolution, arthur, eddington, anticipated, the, discovery, and, mechanism, of, nuclear, fusion, processes, in, stars, in, his, paper, the, internal, constitution, of, the, stars, at, that, time, the, source, of, stellar, energy, was, a, complete, mystery, eddington, correctly, speculated, that, the, source, was, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, liberating, enormous, energy, according, to, einstein, s, equation, e, mc, 2, this, was, a, particularly, remarkable, development, since, at, that, time, fusion, and, thermonuclear, energy, and, even, that, stars, are, largely, composed, of, hydrogen, see, metallicity, had, not, yet, been, discovered, in, 1925, cecilia, helena, payne, later, cecilia, payne, gaposchkin, wrote, an, influential, doctoral, dissertation, at, radcliffe, college, in, which, she, applied, saha, s, ionization, theory, to, stellar, atmospheres, to, relate, the, spectral, classes, to, the, temperature, of, stars, most, significantly, she, discovered, that, hydrogen, and, helium, were, the, principal, components, of, stars, not, the, composition, of, earth, despite, eddington, s, suggestion, discovery, was, so, unexpected, that, her, dissertation, readers, including, russell, convinced, her, to, modify, the, conclusion, before, publication, however, later, research, confirmed, her, discovery, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, studies, of, astronomical, spectra, had, expanded, to, cover, wavelengths, extending, from, radio, waves, through, optical, x, ray, and, gamma, wavelengths, in, the, 21st, century, it, further, expanded, to, include, observations, based, on, gravitational, waves, observational, astronomy, is, a, division, of, the, astronomical, science, that, is, concerned, with, recording, and, interpreting, data, in, contrast, with, theoretical, astrophysics, which, is, mainly, concerned, with, finding, out, the, measurable, implications, of, physical, models, it, is, the, practice, of, observing, celestial, objects, by, using, telescopes, and, other, astronomical, apparatus, most, astrophysical, observations, are, made, using, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, other, than, electromagnetic, radiation, few, things, may, be, observed, from, the, earth, that, originate, from, great, distances, a, few, gravitational, wave, observatories, have, been, constructed, but, gravitational, waves, are, extremely, difficult, to, detect, neutrino, observatories, have, also, been, built, primarily, to, study, the, sun, cosmic, rays, consisting, of, very, high, energy, particles, can, be, observed, hitting, the, earth, s, atmosphere, observations, can, also, vary, in, their, time, scale, most, optical, observations, take, minutes, to, hours, so, phenomena, that, change, faster, than, this, cannot, readily, be, observed, however, historical, data, on, some, objects, is, available, spanning, centuries, or, millennia, on, the, other, hand, radio, observations, may, look, at, events, on, a, millisecond, timescale, millisecond, pulsars, or, combine, years, of, data, pulsar, deceleration, studies, the, information, obtained, from, these, different, timescales, is, very, different, the, study, of, the, sun, has, a, special, place, in, observational, astrophysics, due, to, the, tremendous, distance, of, all, other, stars, the, sun, can, be, observed, in, a, kind, of, detail, unparalleled, by, any, other, star, understanding, the, sun, serves, as, a, guide, to, understanding, of, other, stars, the, topic, of, how, stars, change, or, stellar, evolution, is, often, modeled, by, placing, the, varieties, of, star, types, in, their, respective, positions, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, which, can, be, viewed, as, representing, the, state, of, a, stellar, object, from, birth, to, destruction, theoretical, astrophysicists, use, a, wide, variety, of, tools, which, include, analytical, models, for, example, polytropes, to, approximate, the, behaviors, of, a, star, and, computational, numerical, simulations, each, has, some, advantages, analytical, models, of, a, process, are, generally, better, for, giving, insight, into, the, heart, of, what, is, going, on, numerical, models, can, reveal, the, existence, of, phenomena, and, effects, that, would, otherwise, not, be, seen, theorists, in, astrophysics, endeavor, to, create, theoretical, models, and, figure, out, the, observational, consequences, of, those, models, this, helps, allow, observers, to, look, for, data, that, can, refute, a, model, or, help, in, choosing, between, several, alternate, or, conflicting, models, theorists, also, try, to, generate, or, modify, models, to, take, into, account, new, data, in, the, case, of, an, inconsistency, the, general, tendency, is, to, try, to, make, minimal, modifications, to, the, model, to, fit, the, data, in, some, cases, a, large, amount, of, inconsistent, data, over, time, may, lead, to, total, abandonment, of, a, model, topics, studied, by, theoretical, astrophysicists, include, stellar, dynamics, and, evolution, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, magnetohydrodynamics, large, scale, structure, of, matter, in, the, universe, origin, of, cosmic, rays, general, relativity, and, physical, cosmology, including, string, cosmology, and, astroparticle, physics, relativistic, astrophysics, serves, as, a, tool, to, gauge, the, properties, of, large, scale, structures, for, which, gravitation, plays, a, significant, role, in, physical, phenomena, investigated, and, as, the, basis, for, black, hole, astro, physics, and, the, study, of, gravitational, waves, some, widely, accepted, and, studied, theories, and, models, in, astrophysics, now, included, in, the, lambda, cdm, model, are, the, big, bang, cosmic, inflation, dark, matter, dark, energy, and, fundamental, theories, of, physics, the, roots, of, astrophysics, can, be, found, in, the, seventeenth, century, emergence, of, a, unified, physics, in, which, the, same, laws, applied, to, the, celestial, and, terrestrial, realms, there, were, scientists, who, were, qualified, in, both, physics, and, astronomy, who, laid, the, firm, foundation, for, the, current, science, of, astrophysics, in, modern, times, students, continue, to, be, drawn, to, astrophysics, due, to, its, popularization, by, the, royal, astronomical, society, and, notable, educators, such, as, prominent, professors, lawrence, krauss, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, stephen, hawking, hubert, reeves, carl, sagan, and, patrick, moore, the, efforts, of, the, early, late, and, present, scientists, continue, to, attract, young, people, to, study, the, history, and, science, of, astrophysics, the, television, sitcom, show, the, big, bang, theory, popularized, the, field, of, astrophysics, with, the, general, public, and, featured, some, well, known, scientists, like, stephen, hawking, and, neil, degrasse, tyson
