in, astronomy, the, main, sequence, is, a, classification, of, stars, which, appear, on, plots, of, stellar, color, versus, brightness, as, a, continuous, and, distinctive, band, stars, on, this, band, are, known, as, main, sequence, stars, or, dwarf, stars, and, positions, of, stars, on, and, off, the, band, are, believed, to, indicate, their, physical, properties, as, well, as, their, progress, through, several, types, of, star, life, cycles, these, are, the, most, numerous, true, stars, in, the, universe, and, include, the, sun, color, magnitude, plots, are, known, as, hertzsprung, russell, diagrams, after, ejnar, hertzsprung, and, henry, norris, russell, after, condensation, and, ignition, of, a, star, it, generates, thermal, energy, in, its, dense, core, region, through, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, during, this, stage, of, the, star, s, lifetime, it, is, located, on, the, main, sequence, at, a, position, determined, primarily, by, its, mass, but, also, based, on, its, chemical, composition, and, age, the, cores, of, main, sequence, stars, are, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, where, outward, thermal, pressure, from, the, hot, core, is, balanced, by, the, inward, pressure, of, gravitational, collapse, from, the, overlying, layers, the, strong, dependence, of, the, rate, of, energy, generation, on, temperature, and, pressure, helps, to, sustain, this, balance, energy, generated, at, the, core, makes, its, way, to, the, surface, and, is, radiated, away, at, the, photosphere, the, energy, is, carried, by, either, radiation, or, convection, with, the, latter, occurring, in, regions, with, steeper, temperature, gradients, higher, opacity, or, both, the, main, sequence, is, sometimes, divided, into, upper, and, lower, parts, based, on, the, dominant, process, that, a, star, uses, to, generate, energy, the, sun, along, with, main, sequence, stars, below, about, 1, 5, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, 1, 5, m, primarily, fuse, hydrogen, atoms, together, in, a, series, of, stages, to, form, helium, a, sequence, called, the, proton, proton, chain, above, this, mass, in, the, upper, main, sequence, the, nuclear, fusion, process, mainly, uses, atoms, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, as, intermediaries, in, the, cno, cycle, that, produces, helium, from, hydrogen, atoms, main, sequence, stars, with, more, than, two, solar, masses, undergo, convection, in, their, core, regions, which, acts, to, stir, up, the, newly, created, helium, and, maintain, the, proportion, of, fuel, needed, for, fusion, to, occur, below, this, mass, stars, have, cores, that, are, entirely, radiative, with, convective, zones, near, the, surface, with, decreasing, stellar, mass, the, proportion, of, the, star, forming, a, convective, envelope, steadily, increases, the, main, sequence, stars, below, 0, 4, m, undergo, convection, throughout, their, mass, when, core, convection, does, not, occur, a, helium, rich, core, develops, surrounded, by, an, outer, layer, of, hydrogen, the, more, massive, a, star, is, the, shorter, its, lifespan, on, the, main, sequence, after, the, hydrogen, fuel, at, the, core, has, been, consumed, the, star, evolves, away, from, the, main, sequence, on, the, hr, diagram, into, a, supergiant, red, giant, or, directly, to, a, white, dwarf, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, information, about, the, types, and, distances, of, stars, became, more, readily, available, the, spectra, of, stars, were, shown, to, have, distinctive, features, which, allowed, them, to, be, categorized, annie, jump, cannon, and, edward, c, pickering, at, harvard, college, observatory, developed, a, method, of, categorization, that, became, known, as, the, harvard, classification, scheme, published, in, the, harvard, annals, in, 1901, in, potsdam, in, 1906, the, danish, astronomer, ejnar, hertzsprung, noticed, that, the, reddest, stars, classified, as, k, and, m, in, the, harvard, scheme, could, be, divided, into, two, distinct, groups, these, stars, are, either, much, brighter, than, the, sun, or, much, fainter, to, distinguish, these, groups, he, called, them, giant, and, dwarf, stars, the, following, year, he, began, studying, star, clusters, large, groupings, of, stars, that, are, co, located, at, approximately, the, same, distance, for, these, stars, he, published, the, first, plots, of, color, versus, luminosity, these, plots, showed, a, prominent, and, continuous, sequence, of, stars, which, he, named, the, main, sequence, at, princeton, university, henry, norris, russell, was, following, a, similar, course, of, research, he, was, studying, the, relationship, between, the, spectral, classification, of, stars, and, their, actual, brightness, as, corrected, for, distance, their, absolute, magnitude, for, this, purpose, he, used, a, set, of, stars, that, had, reliable, parallaxes, and, many, of, which, had, been, categorized, at, harvard, when, he, plotted, the, spectral, types, of, these, stars, against, their, absolute, magnitude, he, found, that, dwarf, stars, followed, a, distinct, relationship, this, allowed, the, real, brightness, of, a, dwarf, star, to, be, predicted, with, reasonable, accuracy, of, the, red, stars, observed, by, hertzsprung, the, dwarf, stars, also, followed, the, spectra, luminosity, relationship, discovered, by, russell, however, giant, stars, are, much, brighter, than, dwarfs, and, so, do, not, follow, the, same, relationship, russell, proposed, that, giant, stars, must, have, low, density, or, great, surface, brightness, and, the, reverse, is, true, of, dwarf, stars, the, same, curve, also, showed, that, there, were, very, few, faint, white, stars, in, 1933, bengt, str, mgren, introduced, the, term, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, to, denote, a, luminosity, spectral, class, diagram, this, name, reflected, the, parallel, development, of, this, technique, by, both, hertzsprung, and, russell, earlier, in, the, century, as, evolutionary, models, of, stars, were, developed, during, the, 1930s, it, was, shown, that, for, stars, with, the, same, composition, the, star, s, mass, determines, its, luminosity, and, radius, conversely, when, a, star, s, chemical, composition, and, its, position, on, the, main, sequence, are, known, the, star, s, mass, and, radius, can, be, deduced, this, became, known, as, the, vogt, russell, theorem, named, after, heinrich, vogt, and, henry, norris, russell, it, was, subsequently, discovered, that, this, relationship, breaks, down, somewhat, for, stars, of, the, non, uniform, composition, a, refined, scheme, for, stellar, classification, was, published, in, 1943, by, william, wilson, morgan, and, philip, childs, keenan, the, mk, classification, assigned, each, star, a, spectral, type, based, on, the, harvard, classification, and, a, luminosity, class, the, harvard, classification, had, been, developed, by, assigning, a, different, letter, to, each, star, based, on, the, strength, of, the, hydrogen, spectral, line, before, the, relationship, between, spectra, and, temperature, was, known, when, ordered, by, temperature, and, when, duplicate, classes, were, removed, the, spectral, types, of, stars, followed, in, order, of, decreasing, temperature, with, colors, ranging, from, blue, to, red, the, sequence, o, b, a, f, g, k, and, m, a, popular, mnemonic, for, memorizing, this, sequence, of, stellar, classes, is, oh, be, a, fine, girl, guy, kiss, me, the, luminosity, class, ranged, from, i, to, v, in, order, of, decreasing, luminosity, stars, of, luminosity, class, v, belonged, to, the, main, sequence, in, april, 2018, astronomers, reported, the, detection, of, the, most, distant, ordinary, i, e, main, sequence, star, named, icarus, formally, macs, j1149, lensed, star, 1, at, 9, billion, light, years, away, from, earth, when, a, protostar, is, formed, from, the, collapse, of, a, giant, molecular, cloud, of, gas, and, dust, in, the, local, interstellar, medium, the, initial, composition, is, homogeneous, throughout, consisting, of, about, 70, hydrogen, 28, helium, and, trace, amounts, of, other, elements, by, mass, the, initial, mass, of, the, star, depends, on, the, local, conditions, within, the, cloud, the, mass, distribution, of, newly, formed, stars, is, described, empirically, by, the, initial, mass, function, during, the, initial, collapse, this, pre, main, sequence, star, generates, energy, through, gravitational, contraction, once, sufficiently, dense, stars, begin, converting, hydrogen, into, helium, and, giving, off, energy, through, an, exothermic, nuclear, fusion, process, when, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, becomes, the, dominant, energy, production, process, and, the, excess, energy, gained, from, gravitational, contraction, has, been, lost, the, star, lies, along, a, curve, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, or, hr, diagram, called, the, standard, main, sequence, astronomers, will, sometimes, refer, to, this, stage, as, zero, age, main, sequence, or, zams, the, zams, curve, can, be, calculated, using, computer, models, of, stellar, properties, at, the, point, when, stars, begin, hydrogen, fusion, from, this, point, the, brightness, and, surface, temperature, of, stars, typically, increase, with, age, a, star, remains, near, its, initial, position, on, the, main, sequence, until, a, significant, amount, of, hydrogen, in, the, core, has, been, consumed, then, begins, to, evolve, into, a, more, luminous, star, on, the, hr, diagram, the, evolving, star, moves, up, and, to, the, right, of, the, main, sequence, thus, the, main, sequence, represents, the, primary, hydrogen, burning, stage, of, a, star, s, lifetime, main, sequence, stars, are, divided, into, the, following, types, m, type, and, to, a, lesser, extent, k, type, main, sequence, stars, are, usually, referred, to, as, red, dwarfs, the, majority, of, stars, on, a, typical, hr, diagram, lie, along, the, main, sequence, curve, this, line, is, pronounced, because, both, the, spectral, type, and, the, luminosity, depends, only, on, a, star, s, mass, at, least, to, zeroth, order, approximation, as, long, as, it, is, fusing, hydrogen, at, its, core, and, that, is, what, almost, all, stars, spend, most, of, their, active, lives, doing, the, temperature, of, a, star, determines, its, spectral, type, via, its, effect, on, the, physical, properties, of, plasma, in, its, photosphere, a, star, s, energy, emission, as, a, function, of, wavelength, is, influenced, by, both, its, temperature, and, composition, a, key, indicator, of, this, energy, distribution, is, given, by, the, color, index, b, v, which, measures, the, star, s, magnitude, in, blue, b, and, green, yellow, v, light, by, means, of, filters, this, difference, in, magnitude, provides, a, measure, of, a, star, s, temperature, main, sequence, stars, are, called, dwarf, stars, but, this, terminology, is, partly, historical, and, can, be, somewhat, confusing, for, the, cooler, stars, dwarfs, such, as, red, dwarfs, orange, dwarfs, and, yellow, dwarfs, are, indeed, much, smaller, and, dimmer, than, other, stars, of, those, colors, however, for, hotter, blue, and, white, stars, the, difference, in, size, and, brightness, between, so, called, dwarf, stars, that, are, on, the, main, sequence, and, so, called, giant, stars, that, are, not, becomes, smaller, for, the, hottest, stars, the, difference, is, not, directly, observable, and, for, these, stars, the, terms, dwarf, and, giant, refer, to, differences, in, spectral, lines, which, indicate, whether, a, star, is, on, or, off, the, main, sequence, nevertheless, very, hot, main, sequence, stars, are, still, sometimes, called, dwarfs, even, though, they, have, roughly, the, same, size, and, brightness, as, the, giant, stars, of, that, temperature, the, common, use, of, dwarf, to, mean, the, main, sequence, is, confusing, in, another, way, because, there, are, dwarf, stars, that, are, not, main, sequence, stars, for, example, a, white, dwarf, is, the, dead, core, left, over, after, a, star, has, shed, its, outer, layers, and, is, much, smaller, than, a, main, sequence, star, roughly, the, size, of, earth, these, represent, the, final, evolutionary, stage, of, many, main, sequence, stars, by, treating, the, star, as, an, idealized, energy, radiator, known, as, a, black, body, the, luminosity, l, and, radius, r, can, be, related, to, the, effective, temperature, t, eff, by, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, where, is, the, stefan, boltzmann, constant, as, the, position, of, a, star, on, the, hr, diagram, shows, its, approximate, luminosity, this, relation, can, be, used, to, estimate, its, radius, the, mass, radius, and, luminosity, of, a, star, are, closely, interlinked, and, their, respective, values, can, be, approximated, by, three, relations, first, is, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, which, relates, the, luminosity, l, the, radius, r, and, the, surface, temperature, t, eff, second, is, the, mass, luminosity, relation, which, relates, the, luminosity, l, and, the, mass, m, finally, the, relationship, between, m, and, r, is, close, to, linear, the, ratio, of, m, to, r, increases, by, a, factor, of, only, three, over, 2, 5, orders, of, magnitude, of, m, this, relation, is, roughly, proportional, to, the, star, s, inner, temperature, t, i, and, its, extremely, slow, increase, reflects, the, fact, that, the, rate, of, energy, generation, in, the, core, strongly, depends, on, this, temperature, whereas, it, has, to, fit, the, mass, luminosity, relation, thus, a, too, high, or, too, low, temperature, will, result, in, stellar, instability, a, better, approximation, is, to, take, l, m, the, energy, generation, rate, per, unit, mass, as, is, proportional, to, t, i, 15, where, t, i, is, the, core, temperature, this, is, suitable, for, stars, at, least, as, massive, as, the, sun, exhibiting, the, cno, cycle, and, gives, the, better, fit, r, m, 0, 78, the, table, below, shows, typical, values, for, stars, along, the, main, sequence, the, values, of, luminosity, l, radius, r, and, mass, m, are, relative, to, the, sun, a, dwarf, star, with, a, spectral, classification, of, g2, v, the, actual, values, for, a, star, may, vary, by, as, much, as, 20, 30, from, the, values, listed, below, all, main, sequence, stars, have, a, core, region, where, energy, is, generated, by, nuclear, fusion, the, temperature, and, density, of, this, core, are, at, the, levels, necessary, to, sustain, the, energy, production, that, will, support, the, remainder, of, the, star, a, reduction, of, energy, production, would, cause, the, overlaying, mass, to, compress, the, core, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, fusion, rate, because, of, higher, temperature, and, pressure, likewise, an, increase, in, energy, production, would, cause, the, star, to, expand, lowering, the, pressure, at, the, core, thus, the, star, forms, a, self, regulating, system, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, that, is, stable, over, the, course, of, its, main, sequence, lifetime, main, sequence, stars, employ, two, types, of, hydrogen, fusion, processes, and, the, rate, of, energy, generation, from, each, type, depends, on, the, temperature, in, the, core, region, astronomers, divide, the, main, sequence, into, upper, and, lower, parts, based, on, which, of, the, two, is, the, dominant, fusion, process, in, the, lower, main, sequence, energy, is, primarily, generated, as, the, result, of, the, proton, proton, chain, which, directly, fuses, hydrogen, together, in, a, series, of, stages, to, produce, helium, stars, in, the, upper, main, sequence, have, sufficiently, high, core, temperatures, to, efficiently, use, the, cno, cycle, see, chart, this, process, uses, atoms, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, as, intermediaries, in, the, process, of, fusing, hydrogen, into, helium, at, a, stellar, core, temperature, of, 18, million, kelvin, the, pp, process, and, cno, cycle, are, equally, efficient, and, each, type, generates, half, of, the, star, s, net, luminosity, as, this, is, the, core, temperature, of, a, star, with, about, 1, 5, m, the, upper, main, sequence, consists, of, stars, above, this, mass, thus, roughly, speaking, stars, of, spectral, class, f, or, cooler, belong, to, the, lower, main, sequence, while, a, type, stars, or, hotter, are, upper, main, sequence, stars, the, transition, in, primary, energy, production, from, one, form, to, the, other, spans, a, range, difference, of, less, than, a, single, solar, mass, in, the, sun, a, one, solar, mass, star, only, 1, 5, of, the, energy, is, generated, by, the, cno, cycle, by, contrast, stars, with, 1, 8, m, or, above, generate, almost, their, entire, energy, output, through, the, cno, cycle, the, observed, upper, limit, for, a, main, sequence, star, is, 120, 200, m, the, theoretical, explanation, for, this, limit, is, that, stars, above, this, mass, can, not, radiate, energy, fast, enough, to, remain, stable, so, any, additional, mass, will, be, ejected, in, a, series, of, pulsations, until, the, star, reaches, a, stable, limit, the, lower, limit, for, sustained, proton, proton, nuclear, fusion, is, about, 0, 08, m, or, 80, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, below, this, threshold, are, sub, stellar, objects, that, can, not, sustain, hydrogen, fusion, known, as, brown, dwarfs, because, there, is, a, temperature, difference, between, the, core, and, the, surface, or, photosphere, energy, is, transported, outward, the, two, modes, for, transporting, this, energy, are, radiation, and, convection, a, radiation, zone, where, energy, is, transported, by, radiation, is, stable, against, convection, and, there, is, very, little, mixing, of, the, plasma, by, contrast, in, a, convection, zone, the, energy, is, transported, by, bulk, movement, of, plasma, with, hotter, material, rising, and, cooler, material, descending, convection, is, a, more, efficient, mode, for, carrying, energy, than, radiation, but, it, will, only, occur, under, conditions, that, create, a, steep, temperature, gradient, in, massive, stars, above, 10, m, the, rate, of, energy, generation, by, the, cno, cycle, is, very, sensitive, to, temperature, so, the, fusion, is, highly, concentrated, at, the, core, consequently, there, is, a, high, temperature, gradient, in, the, core, region, which, results, in, a, convection, zone, for, more, efficient, energy, transport, this, mixing, of, material, around, the, core, removes, the, helium, ash, from, the, hydrogen, burning, region, allowing, more, of, the, hydrogen, in, the, star, to, be, consumed, during, the, main, sequence, lifetime, the, outer, regions, of, a, massive, star, transport, energy, by, radiation, with, little, or, no, convection, intermediate, mass, stars, such, as, sirius, may, transport, energy, primarily, by, radiation, with, a, small, core, convection, region, medium, sized, low, mass, stars, like, the, sun, have, a, core, region, that, is, stable, against, convection, with, a, convection, zone, near, the, surface, that, mixes, the, outer, layers, this, results, in, a, steady, buildup, of, a, helium, rich, core, surrounded, by, a, hydrogen, rich, outer, region, by, contrast, cool, very, low, mass, stars, below, 0, 4, m, are, convective, throughout, thus, the, helium, produced, at, the, core, is, distributed, across, the, star, producing, a, relatively, uniform, atmosphere, and, a, proportionately, longer, main, sequence, lifespan, as, non, fusing, helium, accumulates, in, the, core, of, a, main, sequence, star, the, reduction, in, the, abundance, of, hydrogen, per, unit, mass, results, in, a, gradual, lowering, of, the, fusion, rate, within, that, mass, since, it, is, fusion, supplied, power, that, maintains, the, pressure, of, the, core, and, supports, the, higher, layers, of, the, star, the, core, gradually, gets, compressed, this, brings, hydrogen, rich, material, into, a, shell, around, the, helium, rich, core, at, a, depth, where, the, pressure, is, sufficient, for, fusion, to, occur, the, high, power, output, from, this, shell, pushes, the, higher, layers, of, the, star, further, out, this, causes, a, gradual, increase, in, the, radius, and, consequently, luminosity, of, the, star, over, time, for, example, the, luminosity, of, the, early, sun, was, only, about, 70, of, its, current, value, as, a, star, ages, it, thus, changes, its, position, on, the, hr, diagram, this, evolution, is, reflected, in, a, broadening, of, the, main, sequence, band, which, contains, stars, at, various, evolutionary, stages, other, factors, that, broaden, the, main, sequence, band, on, the, hr, diagram, include, uncertainty, in, the, distance, to, stars, and, the, presence, of, unresolved, binary, stars, that, can, alter, the, observed, stellar, parameters, however, even, perfect, observation, would, show, a, fuzzy, main, sequence, because, mass, is, not, the, only, parameter, that, affects, a, star, s, color, and, luminosity, variations, in, chemical, composition, caused, by, the, initial, abundances, the, star, s, evolutionary, status, interaction, with, a, close, companion, rapid, rotation, or, a, magnetic, field, can, all, slightly, change, a, main, sequence, star, s, hr, diagram, position, to, name, just, a, few, factors, as, an, example, there, are, metal, poor, stars, with, a, very, low, abundance, of, elements, with, higher, atomic, numbers, than, helium, that, lie, just, below, the, main, sequence, and, are, known, as, subdwarfs, these, stars, are, fusing, hydrogen, in, their, cores, and, so, they, mark, the, lower, edge, of, the, main, sequence, fuzziness, caused, by, variance, in, chemical, composition, a, nearly, vertical, region, of, the, hr, diagram, known, as, the, instability, strip, is, occupied, by, pulsating, variable, stars, known, as, cepheid, variables, these, stars, vary, in, magnitude, at, regular, intervals, giving, them, a, pulsating, appearance, the, strip, intersects, the, upper, part, of, the, main, sequence, in, the, region, of, class, a, and, f, stars, which, are, between, one, and, two, solar, masses, pulsating, stars, in, this, part, of, the, instability, strip, intersecting, the, upper, part, of, the, main, sequence, are, called, delta, scuti, variables, main, sequence, stars, in, this, region, experience, only, small, changes, in, magnitude, so, this, variation, is, difficult, to, detect, other, classes, of, unstable, main, sequence, stars, like, beta, cephei, variables, are, unrelated, to, this, instability, strip, the, total, amount, of, energy, that, a, star, can, generate, through, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, is, limited, by, the, amount, of, hydrogen, fuel, that, can, be, consumed, at, the, core, for, a, star, in, equilibrium, the, thermal, energy, generated, at, the, core, must, be, at, least, equal, to, the, energy, radiated, at, the, surface, since, the, luminosity, gives, the, amount, of, energy, radiated, per, unit, time, the, total, life, span, can, be, estimated, to, first, approximation, as, the, total, energy, produced, divided, by, the, star, s, luminosity, for, a, star, with, at, least, 0, 5, m, when, the, hydrogen, supply, in, its, core, is, exhausted, and, it, expands, to, become, a, red, giant, it, can, start, to, fuse, helium, atoms, to, form, carbon, the, energy, output, of, the, helium, fusion, process, per, unit, mass, is, only, about, a, tenth, the, energy, output, of, the, hydrogen, process, and, the, luminosity, of, the, star, increases, this, results, in, a, much, shorter, length, of, time, in, this, stage, compared, to, the, main, sequence, lifetime, for, example, the, sun, is, predicted, to, spend, 130, million, years, burning, helium, compared, to, about, 12, billion, years, burning, hydrogen, thus, about, 90, of, the, observed, stars, above, 0, 5, m, will, be, on, the, main, sequence, on, average, main, sequence, stars, are, known, to, follow, an, empirical, mass, luminosity, relationship, the, luminosity, l, of, the, star, is, roughly, proportional, to, the, total, mass, m, as, the, following, power, law, this, relationship, applies, to, main, sequence, stars, in, the, range, 0, 1, 50, m, the, amount, of, fuel, available, for, nuclear, fusion, is, proportional, to, the, mass, of, the, star, thus, the, lifetime, of, a, star, on, the, main, sequence, can, be, estimated, by, comparing, it, to, solar, evolutionary, models, the, sun, has, been, a, main, sequence, star, for, about, 4, 5, billion, years, and, it, will, become, a, red, giant, in, 6, 5, billion, years, for, a, total, main, sequence, lifetime, of, roughly, 10, 10, years, hence, where, m, and, l, are, the, mass, and, luminosity, of, the, star, respectively, m, displaystyle, m, bigodot, is, a, solar, mass, l, displaystyle, l, bigodot, is, the, solar, luminosity, and, ms, displaystyle, tau, text, ms, is, the, star, s, estimated, main, sequence, lifetime, although, more, massive, stars, have, more, fuel, to, burn, and, might, intuitively, be, expected, to, last, longer, they, also, radiate, a, proportionately, greater, amount, with, increased, mass, this, is, required, by, the, stellar, equation, of, state, for, a, massive, star, to, maintain, equilibrium, the, outward, pressure, of, radiated, energy, generated, in, the, core, not, only, must, but, will, rise, to, match, the, titanic, inward, gravitational, pressure, of, its, envelope, thus, the, most, massive, stars, may, remain, on, the, main, sequence, for, only, a, few, million, years, while, stars, with, less, than, a, tenth, of, a, solar, mass, may, last, for, over, a, trillion, years, the, exact, mass, luminosity, relationship, depends, on, how, efficiently, energy, can, be, transported, from, the, core, to, the, surface, a, higher, opacity, has, an, insulating, effect, that, retains, more, energy, at, the, core, so, the, star, does, not, need, to, produce, as, much, energy, to, remain, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, by, contrast, a, lower, opacity, means, energy, escapes, more, rapidly, and, the, star, must, burn, more, fuel, to, remain, in, equilibrium, a, sufficiently, high, opacity, can, result, in, energy, transport, via, convection, which, changes, the, conditions, needed, to, remain, in, equilibrium, in, high, mass, main, sequence, stars, the, opacity, is, dominated, by, electron, scattering, which, is, nearly, constant, with, increasing, temperature, thus, the, luminosity, only, increases, as, the, cube, of, the, star, s, mass, for, stars, below, 10, m, the, opacity, becomes, dependent, on, temperature, resulting, in, the, luminosity, varying, approximately, as, the, fourth, power, of, the, star, s, mass, for, very, low, mass, stars, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, also, contribute, to, the, opacity, below, about, 0, 5, m, the, luminosity, of, the, star, varies, as, the, mass, to, the, power, of, 2, 3, producing, a, flattening, of, the, slope, on, a, graph, of, mass, versus, luminosity, even, these, refinements, are, only, an, approximation, however, and, the, mass, luminosity, relation, can, vary, depending, on, a, star, s, composition, when, a, main, sequence, star, has, consumed, the, hydrogen, at, its, core, the, loss, of, energy, generation, causes, its, gravitational, collapse, to, resume, and, the, star, evolves, off, the, main, sequence, the, path, which, the, star, follows, across, the, hr, diagram, is, called, an, evolutionary, track, stars, with, less, than, 0, 23, m, are, predicted, to, directly, become, white, dwarfs, when, energy, generation, by, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, at, their, core, comes, to, a, halt, but, stars, in, this, mass, range, have, main, sequence, lifetimes, longer, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, so, no, stars, are, old, enough, for, this, to, have, occurred, in, stars, more, massive, than, 0, 23, m, the, hydrogen, surrounding, the, helium, core, reaches, sufficient, temperature, and, pressure, to, undergo, fusion, forming, a, hydrogen, burning, shell, and, causing, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, to, expand, and, cool, the, stage, as, these, stars, move, away, from, the, main, sequence, is, known, as, the, subgiant, branch, it, is, relatively, brief, and, appears, as, a, gap, in, the, evolutionary, track, since, few, stars, are, observed, at, that, point, when, the, helium, core, of, low, mass, stars, becomes, degenerate, or, the, outer, layers, of, intermediate, mass, stars, cool, sufficiently, to, become, opaque, their, hydrogen, shells, increase, in, temperature, and, the, stars, start, to, become, more, luminous, this, is, known, as, the, red, giant, branch, it, is, a, relatively, long, lived, stage, and, it, appears, prominently, in, h, r, diagrams, these, stars, will, eventually, end, their, lives, as, white, dwarfs, the, most, massive, stars, do, not, become, red, giants, instead, their, cores, quickly, become, hot, enough, to, fuse, helium, and, eventually, heavier, elements, and, they, are, known, as, supergiants, they, follow, approximately, horizontal, evolutionary, tracks, from, the, main, sequence, across, the, top, of, the, h, r, diagram, supergiants, are, relatively, rare, and, do, not, show, prominently, on, most, h, r, diagrams, their, cores, will, eventually, collapse, usually, leading, to, a, supernova, and, leaving, behind, either, a, neutron, star, or, black, hole, when, a, cluster, of, stars, is, formed, at, about, the, same, time, the, main, sequence, lifespan, of, these, stars, will, depend, on, their, individual, masses, the, most, massive, stars, will, leave, the, main, sequence, first, followed, in, sequence, by, stars, of, ever, lower, masses, the, position, where, stars, in, the, cluster, are, leaving, the, main, sequence, is, known, as, the, turnoff, point, by, knowing, the, main, sequence, lifespan, of, stars, at, this, point, it, becomes, possible, to, estimate, the, age, of, the, cluster
