an, extinction, event, also, known, as, a, mass, extinction, or, biotic, crisis, is, a, widespread, and, rapid, decrease, in, the, biodiversity, on, earth, such, an, event, is, identified, by, a, sharp, fall, in, the, diversity, and, abundance, of, multicellular, organisms, it, occurs, when, the, rate, of, extinction, increases, with, respect, to, the, background, extinction, rate, and, the, rate, of, speciation, estimates, of, the, number, of, major, mass, extinctions, in, the, last, 540, million, years, range, from, as, few, as, five, to, more, than, twenty, these, differences, stem, from, disagreement, as, to, what, constitutes, a, major, extinction, event, and, the, data, chosen, to, measure, past, diversity, in, a, landmark, paper, published, in, 1982, jack, sepkoski, and, david, m, raup, identified, five, particular, geological, intervals, with, excessive, diversity, loss, they, were, originally, identified, as, outliers, on, a, general, trend, of, decreasing, extinction, rates, during, the, phanerozoic, but, as, more, stringent, statistical, tests, have, been, applied, to, the, accumulating, data, it, has, been, established, that, in, the, current, phanerozoic, eon, multicellular, animal, life, has, experienced, at, least, five, major, and, many, minor, mass, extinctions, the, big, five, cannot, be, so, clearly, defined, but, rather, appear, to, represent, the, largest, or, some, of, the, largest, of, a, relatively, smooth, continuum, of, extinction, events, all, of, the, five, in, the, phanerozoic, eon, were, anciently, preceded, by, the, presumed, far, more, extensive, mass, extinction, of, microbial, life, during, the, great, oxidation, event, aka, oxygen, catastrophe, early, in, the, proterozoic, eon, at, the, end, of, the, ediacaran, and, just, before, the, cambrian, explosion, yet, another, proterozoic, extinction, event, of, unknown, magnitude, is, speculated, to, have, ushered, in, the, phanerozoic, in, may, 2020, studies, suggested, that, the, causes, of, the, mass, extinction, were, global, warming, related, to, volcanism, and, anoxia, and, not, as, considered, earlier, cooling, and, glaciation, however, this, is, at, odds, with, numerous, previous, studies, which, have, indicated, global, cooling, as, the, primary, driver, most, recently, the, deposition, of, volcanic, ash, has, been, suggested, to, be, the, trigger, for, reductions, in, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, leading, to, the, glaciation, and, anoxia, observed, in, the, geological, record, the, largest, extinction, was, the, kellwasser, event, frasnian, famennian, or, f, f, 372, ma, an, extinction, event, at, the, end, of, the, frasnian, about, midway, through, the, late, devonian, this, extinction, annihilated, coral, reefs, and, numerous, tropical, benthic, seabed, living, animals, such, as, jawless, fish, brachiopods, and, trilobites, the, other, major, extinction, was, the, hangenberg, event, devonian, carboniferous, or, d, c, 359, ma, which, brought, an, end, to, the, devonian, as, a, whole, this, extinction, wiped, out, the, armored, placoderm, fish, and, nearly, led, to, the, extinction, of, the, newly, evolved, ammonoids, these, two, closely, spaced, extinction, events, collectively, eliminated, about, 19, of, all, families, 50, of, all, genera, and, at, least, 70, of, all, species, sepkoski, and, raup, 1982, did, not, initially, consider, the, late, devonian, extinction, interval, givetian, frasnian, and, famennian, stages, to, be, statistically, significant, regardless, later, studies, have, affirmed, the, strong, ecological, impacts, of, the, kellwasser, and, hangenberg, events, the, end, permian, extinction, or, the, great, dying, occurred, at, the, permian, triassic, transition, it, was, the, phanerozoic, eon, s, largest, extinction, 53, of, marine, families, died, 84, of, marine, genera, about, 81, of, all, marine, species, and, an, estimated, 70, of, terrestrial, vertebrate, species, this, is, also, the, largest, known, extinction, event, for, insects, the, highly, successful, marine, arthropod, the, trilobite, became, extinct, the, evidence, regarding, plants, is, less, clear, but, new, taxa, became, dominant, after, the, extinction, the, great, dying, had, enormous, evolutionary, significance, on, land, it, ended, the, primacy, of, early, synapsids, the, recovery, of, vertebrates, took, 30, million, years, but, the, vacant, niches, created, the, opportunity, for, archosaurs, to, become, ascendant, in, the, seas, the, percentage, of, animals, that, were, sessile, unable, to, move, about, dropped, from, 67, to, 50, the, whole, late, permian, was, a, difficult, time, at, least, for, marine, life, even, before, the, p, t, boundary, extinction, more, recent, research, has, indicated, that, the, end, capitanian, extinction, event, that, preceded, the, great, dying, likely, constitutes, a, separate, event, from, the, p, t, extinction, if, so, it, would, be, larger, than, some, of, the, big, five, extinction, events, the, end, cretaceous, extinction, or, the, k, pg, extinction, formerly, k, t, extinction, occurred, at, the, cretaceous, maastrichtian, paleogene, danian, transition, the, event, was, formerly, called, the, cretaceous, tertiary, or, k, t, extinction, or, k, t, boundary, it, is, now, officially, named, the, cretaceous, paleogene, or, k, pg, extinction, event, about, 17, of, all, families, 50, of, all, genera, and, 75, of, all, species, became, extinct, in, the, seas, all, the, ammonites, plesiosaurs, and, mosasaurs, disappeared, and, the, percentage, of, sessile, animals, was, reduced, to, about, 33, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, became, extinct, during, that, time, the, boundary, event, was, severe, with, a, significant, amount, of, variability, in, the, rate, of, extinction, between, and, among, different, clades, mammals, descended, from, the, synapsids, and, birds, a, side, branch, of, the, theropod, dinosaurs, emerged, as, the, two, predominant, clades, of, terrestrial, tetrapods, despite, the, common, presentation, focusing, only, on, these, five, events, no, measure, of, extinction, shows, any, definite, line, separating, them, from, the, many, other, phanerozoic, extinction, events, that, appear, only, slightly, lesser, catastrophies, further, using, different, methods, of, calculating, an, extinction, s, impact, can, lead, to, other, events, featuring, in, the, top, five, fossil, records, of, older, events, are, more, difficult, to, interpret, this, is, because, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, apparent, variations, in, marine, biodiversity, may, actually, be, an, artifact, with, abundance, estimates, directly, related, to, quantity, of, rock, available, for, sampling, from, different, time, periods, however, statistical, analysis, shows, that, this, can, only, account, for, 50, of, the, observed, pattern, and, other, evidence, such, as, fungal, spikes, geologically, rapid, increase, in, fungal, abundance, provides, reassurance, that, most, widely, accepted, extinction, events, are, real, a, quantification, of, the, rock, exposure, of, western, europe, indicates, that, many, of, the, minor, events, for, which, a, biological, explanation, has, been, sought, are, most, readily, explained, by, sampling, bias, research, completed, after, the, seminal, 1982, paper, sepkoski, and, raup, has, concluded, that, a, sixth, mass, extinction, event, is, ongoing, due, to, human, activities, extinction, events, can, be, tracked, by, several, methods, including, geological, change, ecological, impact, extinction, vs, origination, speciation, rates, and, most, commonly, diversity, loss, among, taxonomic, units, most, early, papers, used, families, as, the, unit, of, taxonomy, based, on, compendiums, of, marine, animal, families, by, sepkoski, 1982, 1992, later, papers, by, sepkoski, and, other, authors, switched, to, genera, which, are, more, precise, than, families, and, less, prone, to, taxonomic, bias, or, incomplete, sampling, relative, to, species, these, are, several, major, papers, estimating, loss, or, ecological, impact, from, fifteen, commonly, discussed, extinction, events, different, methods, used, by, these, papers, are, described, in, the, following, section, the, big, five, mass, extinctions, are, bolded, a, graphed, but, not, discussed, by, sepkoski, 1996, considered, continuous, with, the, late, devonian, mass, extinction, b, at, the, time, considered, continuous, with, the, end, permian, mass, extinction, c, includes, late, norian, time, slices, d, diversity, loss, of, both, pulses, calculated, together, e, pulses, extend, over, adjacent, time, slices, calculated, separately, f, considered, ecologically, significant, but, not, analyzed, directly, g, excluded, due, to, a, lack, of, consensus, on, late, triassic, chronology, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, study, of, mass, extinctions, was, hampered, by, insufficient, data, mass, extinctions, though, acknowledged, were, considered, mysterious, exceptions, to, the, prevailing, gradualistic, view, of, prehistory, where, slow, evolutionary, trends, define, faunal, changes, the, first, breakthrough, was, published, in, 1980, by, a, team, led, by, luis, alvarez, who, discovered, trace, metal, evidence, for, an, asteroid, impact, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, the, alvarez, hypothesis, for, the, end, cretaceous, extinction, gave, mass, extinctions, and, catastrophic, explanations, newfound, popular, and, scientific, attention, another, landmark, study, came, in, 1982, when, a, paper, written, by, david, m, raup, and, jack, sepkoski, was, published, in, the, journal, science, this, paper, originating, from, a, compendium, of, extinct, marine, animal, families, developed, by, sepkoski, identified, five, peaks, of, marine, family, extinctions, which, stand, out, among, a, backdrop, of, decreasing, extinction, rates, through, time, four, of, these, peaks, were, statistically, significant, the, ashgillian, end, ordovician, late, permian, norian, end, triassic, and, maastrichtian, end, cretaceous, the, remaining, peak, was, a, broad, interval, of, high, extinction, smeared, over, the, later, half, of, the, devonian, with, its, apex, in, the, frasnian, stage, through, the, 1980s, raup, and, sepkoski, continued, to, elaborate, and, build, upon, their, extinction, and, origination, data, defining, a, high, resolution, biodiversity, curve, the, sepkoski, curve, and, successive, evolutionary, faunas, with, their, own, patterns, of, diversification, and, extinction, though, these, interpretations, formed, a, strong, basis, for, subsequent, studies, of, mass, extinctions, raup, and, sepkoski, also, proposed, a, more, controversial, idea, in, 1984, a, 26, million, year, periodic, pattern, to, mass, extinctions, two, teams, of, astronomers, linked, this, to, a, hypothetical, brown, dwarf, in, the, distant, reaches, of, the, solar, system, inventing, the, nemesis, hypothesis, which, has, been, strongly, disputed, by, other, astronomers, around, the, same, time, sepkoski, began, to, devise, a, compendium, of, marine, animal, genera, which, would, allow, researchers, to, explore, extinction, at, a, finer, taxonomic, resolution, he, began, to, publish, preliminary, results, of, this, in, progress, study, as, early, as, 1986, in, a, paper, which, identified, 29, extinction, intervals, of, note, by, 1992, he, also, updated, his, 1982, family, compendium, finding, minimal, changes, to, the, diversity, curve, despite, a, decade, of, new, data, in, 1996, sepkoski, published, another, paper, which, tracked, marine, genera, extinction, in, terms, of, net, diversity, loss, by, stage, similar, to, his, previous, work, on, family, extinctions, the, paper, filtered, its, sample, in, three, ways, all, genera, the, entire, unfiltered, sample, size, multiple, interval, genera, only, those, found, in, more, than, one, stage, and, well, preserved, genera, excluding, those, from, groups, with, poor, or, understudied, fossil, records, diversity, trends, in, marine, animal, families, were, also, revised, based, on, his, 1992, update, revived, interest, in, mass, extinctions, led, many, other, authors, to, re, evaluate, geological, events, in, the, context, of, their, effects, on, life, a, 1995, paper, by, michael, benton, tracked, extinction, and, origination, rates, among, both, marine, and, continental, freshwater, terrestrial, families, identifying, 22, extinction, intervals, and, no, periodic, pattern, overview, books, by, o, h, walliser, 1996, and, a, hallam, and, p, b, wignall, 1997, summarized, the, new, extinction, research, of, the, previous, two, decades, one, chapter, in, the, former, source, lists, over, 60, geological, events, which, could, conceivably, be, considered, global, extinctions, of, varying, sizes, these, texts, and, other, widely, circulated, publications, in, the, 1990s, helped, to, establish, the, popular, image, of, mass, extinctions, as, a, big, five, alongside, many, smaller, extinctions, through, prehistory, though, sepkoski, passed, away, in, 1999, his, marine, genera, compendium, was, formally, published, in, 2002, this, prompted, a, new, wave, of, studies, into, the, dynamics, of, mass, extinctions, these, papers, utilized, the, compendium, to, track, origination, rates, the, rate, that, new, species, appear, or, speciate, parallel, to, extinction, rates, in, the, context, of, geological, stages, or, substages, a, review, and, re, analysis, of, sepkoski, s, data, by, bambach, 2006, identified, 18, distinct, mass, extinction, intervals, including, 4, large, extinctions, in, the, cambrian, these, fit, sepkoski, s, definition, of, extinction, as, short, substages, with, large, diversity, loss, and, overall, high, extinction, rates, relative, to, their, surroundings, bambach, et, al, 2004, considered, each, of, the, big, five, extinction, intervals, to, have, a, different, pattern, in, the, relationship, between, origination, and, extinction, trends, moreover, background, extinction, rates, were, broadly, variable, and, could, be, separated, into, more, severe, and, less, severe, time, intervals, background, extinctions, were, least, severe, relative, to, the, origination, rate, in, the, middle, ordovician, early, silurian, late, carboniferous, permian, and, jurassic, recent, this, argues, that, the, late, ordovician, end, permian, and, end, cretaceous, extinctions, were, statistically, significant, outliers, in, biodiversity, trends, while, the, late, devonian, and, end, triassic, extinctions, occurred, in, time, periods, which, were, already, stressed, by, relatively, high, extinction, and, low, origination, computer, models, run, by, foote, 2005, determined, that, abrupt, pulses, of, extinction, fit, the, pattern, of, prehistoric, biodiversity, much, better, than, a, gradual, and, continuous, background, extinction, rate, with, smooth, peaks, and, troughs, this, strongly, supports, the, utility, of, rapid, frequent, mass, extinctions, as, a, major, driver, of, diversity, changes, pulsed, origination, events, are, also, supported, though, to, a, lesser, degree, which, is, largely, dependent, on, pulsed, extinctions, similarly, stanley, 2007, used, extinction, and, origination, data, to, investigate, turnover, rates, and, extinction, responses, among, different, evolutionary, faunas, and, taxonomic, groups, in, contrast, to, previous, authors, his, diversity, simulations, show, support, for, an, overall, exponential, rate, of, biodiversity, growth, through, the, entire, phanerozoic, as, data, continued, to, accumulate, some, authors, began, to, re, evaluate, sepkoski, s, sample, using, methods, meant, to, account, for, sampling, biases, as, early, as, 1982, a, paper, by, phillip, w, signor, and, jere, h, lipps, noted, that, the, true, sharpness, of, extinctions, was, diluted, by, the, incompleteness, of, the, fossil, record, this, phenomenon, later, called, the, signor, lipps, effect, notes, that, a, species, true, extinction, must, occur, after, its, last, fossil, and, that, origination, must, occur, before, its, first, fossil, thus, species, which, appear, to, die, out, just, prior, to, an, abrupt, extinction, event, may, instead, be, a, victim, of, the, event, despite, an, apparent, gradual, decline, looking, at, the, fossil, record, alone, a, model, by, foote, 2007, found, that, many, geological, stages, had, artificially, inflated, extinction, rates, due, to, signor, lipps, backsmearing, from, later, stages, with, extinction, events, other, biases, include, the, difficulty, in, assessing, taxa, with, high, turnover, rates, or, restricted, occurrences, which, cannot, be, directly, assessed, due, to, a, lack, of, fine, scale, temporal, resolution, many, paleontologists, opt, to, assess, diversity, trends, by, randomized, sampling, and, rarefaction, of, fossil, abundances, rather, than, raw, temporal, range, data, in, order, to, account, for, all, of, these, biases, but, that, solution, is, influenced, by, biases, related, to, sample, size, one, major, bias, in, particular, is, the, pull, of, the, recent, the, fact, that, the, fossil, record, and, thus, known, diversity, generally, improves, closer, to, the, modern, day, this, means, that, biodiversity, and, abundance, for, older, geological, periods, may, be, underestimated, from, raw, data, alone, alroy, 2010, attempted, to, circumvent, sample, size, related, biases, in, diversity, estimates, using, a, method, he, called, shareholder, quorum, subsampling, sqs, in, this, method, fossils, are, sampled, from, a, collection, such, as, a, time, interval, to, assess, the, relative, diversity, of, that, collection, every, time, a, new, species, or, other, taxon, enters, the, sample, it, brings, over, all, other, fossils, belonging, to, that, species, in, the, collection, its, share, of, the, collection, for, example, a, skewed, collection, with, half, its, fossils, from, one, species, will, immediately, reach, a, sample, share, of, 50, if, that, species, is, the, first, to, be, sampled, this, continues, adding, up, the, sample, shares, until, a, coverage, or, quorum, is, reached, referring, to, a, pre, set, desired, sum, of, share, percentages, at, that, point, the, number, of, species, in, the, sample, are, counted, a, collection, with, more, species, is, expected, to, reach, a, sample, quorum, with, more, species, thus, accurately, comparing, the, relative, diversity, change, between, two, collections, without, relying, on, the, biases, inherent, to, sample, size, alroy, also, elaborated, on, three, timer, algorithms, which, are, meant, to, counteract, biases, in, estimates, of, extinction, and, origination, rates, a, given, taxon, is, a, three, timer, if, it, can, be, found, before, after, and, within, a, given, time, interval, and, a, two, timer, if, it, overlaps, with, a, time, interval, on, one, side, counting, three, timers, and, two, timers, on, either, end, of, a, time, interval, and, sampling, time, intervals, in, sequence, can, together, be, combined, into, equations, to, predict, extinction, and, origination, with, less, bias, in, subsequent, papers, alroy, continued, to, refine, his, equations, to, improve, lingering, issues, with, precision, and, unusual, samples, mcghee, et, al, 2013, a, paper, which, primarily, focused, on, ecological, effects, of, mass, extinctions, also, published, new, estimates, of, extinction, severity, based, on, alroy, s, methods, many, extinctions, were, significantly, more, impactful, under, these, new, estimates, though, some, were, less, prominent, stanley, 2016, was, another, paper, which, attempted, to, remove, two, common, errors, in, previous, estimates, of, extinction, severity, the, first, error, was, the, unjustified, removal, of, singletons, genera, unique, to, only, a, single, time, slice, their, removal, would, mask, the, influence, of, groups, with, high, turnover, rates, or, lineages, cut, short, early, in, their, diversification, the, second, error, was, the, difficulty, in, distinguishing, background, extinctions, from, brief, mass, extinction, events, within, the, same, short, time, interval, to, circumvent, this, issue, background, rates, of, diversity, change, extinction, origination, were, estimated, for, stages, or, substages, without, mass, extinctions, and, then, assumed, to, apply, to, subsequent, stages, with, mass, extinctions, for, example, the, santonian, and, campanian, stages, were, each, used, to, estimate, diversity, changes, in, the, maastrichtian, prior, to, the, k, pg, mass, extinction, subtracting, background, extinctions, from, extinction, tallies, had, the, effect, of, reducing, the, estimated, severity, of, the, six, sampled, mass, extinction, events, this, effect, was, stronger, for, mass, extinctions, which, occurred, in, periods, with, high, rates, of, background, extinction, like, the, devonian, because, most, diversity, and, biomass, on, earth, is, microbial, and, thus, difficult, to, measure, via, fossils, extinction, events, placed, on, record, are, those, that, affect, the, easily, observed, biologically, complex, component, of, the, biosphere, rather, than, the, total, diversity, and, abundance, of, life, for, this, reason, well, documented, extinction, events, are, confined, to, the, phanerozoic, eon, with, the, sole, exception, of, the, oxygen, catastrophe, in, the, proterozoic, since, before, the, phanerozoic, all, living, organisms, were, either, microbial, or, if, multicellular, then, soft, bodied, perhaps, due, to, the, absence, of, a, robust, microbial, fossil, record, mass, extinctions, might, only, seem, to, be, mainly, a, phanerozoic, phenomenon, with, merely, the, observable, extinction, rates, appearing, low, before, large, complex, organisms, with, hard, body, parts, arose, extinction, occurs, at, an, uneven, rate, based, on, the, fossil, record, the, background, rate, of, extinctions, on, earth, is, about, two, to, five, taxonomic, families, of, marine, animals, every, million, years, the, oxygen, catastrophe, which, occurred, around, 2, 45, billion, years, ago, in, the, paleoproterozoic, is, plausible, as, the, first, ever, major, extinction, event, it, was, perhaps, also, the, worst, ever, in, some, sense, but, with, the, earth, s, ecology, just, before, that, time, so, poorly, understood, and, the, concept, of, prokaryote, genera, so, different, from, genera, of, complex, life, that, it, would, be, difficult, to, meaningfully, compare, it, to, any, of, the, big, five, even, if, paleoproterozoic, life, were, better, known, since, the, cambrian, explosion, five, further, major, mass, extinctions, have, significantly, exceeded, the, background, extinction, rate, the, most, recent, and, best, known, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, which, occurred, approximately, 66, ma, million, years, ago, was, a, large, scale, mass, extinction, of, animal, and, plant, species, in, a, geologically, short, period, of, time, in, addition, to, the, five, major, phanerozoic, mass, extinctions, there, are, numerous, lesser, ones, and, the, ongoing, mass, extinction, caused, by, human, activity, is, sometimes, called, the, sixth, mass, extinction, mass, extinctions, have, sometimes, accelerated, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, when, dominance, of, particular, ecological, niches, passes, from, one, group, of, organisms, to, another, it, is, rarely, because, the, newly, dominant, group, is, superior, to, the, old, but, usually, because, an, extinction, event, eliminates, the, old, dominant, group, and, makes, way, for, the, new, one, a, process, known, as, adaptive, radiation, for, example, mammaliaformes, almost, mammals, and, then, mammals, existed, throughout, the, reign, of, the, dinosaurs, but, could, not, compete, in, the, large, terrestrial, vertebrate, niches, that, dinosaurs, monopolized, the, end, cretaceous, mass, extinction, removed, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, made, it, possible, for, mammals, to, expand, into, the, large, terrestrial, vertebrate, niches, the, dinosaurs, themselves, had, been, beneficiaries, of, a, previous, mass, extinction, the, end, triassic, which, eliminated, most, of, their, chief, rivals, the, crurotarsans, similarly, within, synapsida, the, replacement, of, taxa, that, originated, in, the, earliest, pennsylvanian, and, cisuralian, evolutionary, radiation, often, still, called, pelycosaurs, though, this, is, a, paraphyletic, group, by, therapsids, occurred, around, the, kungurian, roadian, transition, which, is, often, called, olson, s, extinction, which, may, be, a, slow, decline, over, 20, ma, rather, than, a, dramatic, brief, event, another, point, of, view, put, forward, in, the, escalation, hypothesis, predicts, that, species, in, ecological, niches, with, more, organism, to, organism, conflict, will, be, less, likely, to, survive, extinctions, this, is, because, the, very, traits, that, keep, a, species, numerous, and, viable, under, fairly, static, conditions, become, a, burden, once, population, levels, fall, among, competing, organisms, during, the, dynamics, of, an, extinction, event, furthermore, many, groups, that, survive, mass, extinctions, do, not, recover, in, numbers, or, diversity, and, many, of, these, go, into, long, term, decline, and, these, are, often, referred, to, as, dead, clades, walking, however, clades, that, survive, for, a, considerable, period, of, time, after, a, mass, extinction, and, which, were, reduced, to, only, a, few, species, are, likely, to, have, experienced, a, rebound, effect, called, the, push, of, the, past, darwin, was, firmly, of, the, opinion, that, biotic, interactions, such, as, competition, for, food, and, space, the, struggle, for, existence, were, of, considerably, greater, importance, in, promoting, evolution, and, extinction, than, changes, in, the, physical, environment, he, expressed, this, in, the, origin, of, species, various, authors, have, suggested, that, extinction, events, occurred, periodically, every, 26, to, 30, million, years, or, that, diversity, fluctuates, episodically, about, every, 62, million, years, various, ideas, mostly, regarding, astronomical, influences, attempt, to, explain, the, supposed, pattern, including, the, presence, of, a, hypothetical, companion, star, to, the, sun, oscillations, in, the, galactic, plane, or, passage, through, the, milky, way, s, spiral, arms, however, other, authors, have, concluded, that, the, data, on, marine, mass, extinctions, do, not, fit, with, the, idea, that, mass, extinctions, are, periodic, or, that, ecosystems, gradually, build, up, to, a, point, at, which, a, mass, extinction, is, inevitable, many, of, the, proposed, correlations, have, been, argued, to, be, spurious, or, lacking, statistical, significance, others, have, argued, that, there, is, strong, evidence, supporting, periodicity, in, a, variety, of, records, and, additional, evidence, in, the, form, of, coincident, periodic, variation, in, nonbiological, geochemical, variables, such, as, strontium, isotopes, flood, basalts, anoxic, events, orogenies, and, evaporite, deposition, one, explanation, for, this, proposed, cycle, is, carbon, storage, and, release, by, oceanic, crust, which, exchanges, carbon, between, the, atmosphere, and, mantle, mass, extinctions, are, thought, to, result, when, a, long, term, stress, is, compounded, by, a, short, term, shock, over, the, course, of, the, phanerozoic, individual, taxa, appear, to, have, become, less, likely, to, suffer, extinction, which, may, reflect, more, robust, food, webs, as, well, as, fewer, extinction, prone, species, and, other, factors, such, as, continental, distribution, however, even, after, accounting, for, sampling, bias, there, does, appear, to, be, a, gradual, decrease, in, extinction, and, origination, rates, during, the, phanerozoic, this, may, represent, the, fact, that, groups, with, higher, turnover, rates, are, more, likely, to, become, extinct, by, chance, or, it, may, be, an, artefact, of, taxonomy, families, tend, to, become, more, speciose, therefore, less, prone, to, extinction, over, time, and, larger, taxonomic, groups, by, definition, appear, earlier, in, geological, time, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, oceans, have, gradually, become, more, hospitable, to, life, over, the, last, 500, million, years, and, thus, less, vulnerable, to, mass, extinctions, but, susceptibility, to, extinction, at, a, taxonomic, level, does, not, appear, to, make, mass, extinctions, more, or, less, probable, there, is, still, debate, about, the, causes, of, all, mass, extinctions, in, general, large, extinctions, may, result, when, a, biosphere, under, long, term, stress, undergoes, a, short, term, shock, an, underlying, mechanism, appears, to, be, present, in, the, correlation, of, extinction, and, origination, rates, to, diversity, high, diversity, leads, to, a, persistent, increase, in, extinction, rate, low, diversity, to, a, persistent, increase, in, origination, rate, these, presumably, ecologically, controlled, relationships, likely, amplify, smaller, perturbations, asteroid, impacts, etc, to, produce, the, global, effects, observed, a, good, theory, for, a, particular, mass, extinction, should, it, may, be, necessary, to, consider, combinations, of, causes, for, example, the, marine, aspect, of, the, end, cretaceous, extinction, appears, to, have, been, caused, by, several, processes, that, partially, overlapped, in, time, and, may, have, had, different, levels, of, significance, in, different, parts, of, the, world, arens, and, west, 2006, proposed, a, press, pulse, model, in, which, mass, extinctions, generally, require, two, types, of, cause, long, term, pressure, on, the, eco, system, press, and, a, sudden, catastrophe, pulse, towards, the, end, of, the, period, of, pressure, their, statistical, analysis, of, marine, extinction, rates, throughout, the, phanerozoic, suggested, that, neither, long, term, pressure, alone, nor, a, catastrophe, alone, was, sufficient, to, cause, a, significant, increase, in, the, extinction, rate, macleod, 2001, summarized, the, relationship, between, mass, extinctions, and, events, that, are, most, often, cited, as, causes, of, mass, extinctions, using, data, from, courtillot, jaeger, yang, et, al, 1996, hallam, 1992, and, grieve, pesonen, 1992, the, most, commonly, suggested, causes, of, mass, extinctions, are, listed, below, the, formation, of, large, igneous, provinces, by, flood, basalt, events, could, have, flood, basalt, events, occur, as, pulses, of, activity, punctuated, by, dormant, periods, as, a, result, they, are, likely, to, cause, the, climate, to, oscillate, between, cooling, and, warming, but, with, an, overall, trend, towards, warming, as, the, carbon, dioxide, they, emit, can, stay, in, the, atmosphere, for, hundreds, of, years, flood, basalt, events, have, been, implicated, as, the, cause, of, many, major, extinction, events, it, is, speculated, that, massive, volcanism, caused, or, contributed, to, the, kellwasser, event, the, end, guadalupian, extinction, event, the, end, permian, extinction, event, the, smithian, spathian, extinction, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, the, toarcian, oceanic, anoxic, event, the, cenomanian, turonian, oceanic, anoxic, event, the, cretaceous, palaeogene, extinction, event, and, the, palaeocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, the, correlation, between, gigantic, volcanic, events, expressed, in, the, large, igneous, provinces, and, mass, extinctions, was, shown, for, the, last, 260, million, years, recently, such, possible, correlation, was, extended, across, the, whole, phanerozoic, eon, these, are, often, clearly, marked, by, worldwide, sequences, of, contemporaneous, sediments, that, show, all, or, part, of, a, transition, from, sea, bed, to, tidal, zone, to, beach, to, dry, land, and, where, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, rocks, in, the, relevant, areas, were, raised, by, geological, processes, such, as, orogeny, sea, level, falls, could, reduce, the, continental, shelf, area, the, most, productive, part, of, the, oceans, sufficiently, to, cause, a, marine, mass, extinction, and, could, disrupt, weather, patterns, enough, to, cause, extinctions, on, land, but, sea, level, falls, are, very, probably, the, result, of, other, events, such, as, sustained, global, cooling, or, the, sinking, of, the, mid, ocean, ridges, sea, level, falls, are, associated, with, most, of, the, mass, extinctions, including, all, of, the, big, five, end, ordovician, late, devonian, end, permian, end, triassic, and, end, cretaceous, along, with, the, more, recently, recognised, capitanian, mass, extinction, of, comparable, severity, to, the, big, five, a, 2008, study, published, in, the, journal, nature, established, a, relationship, between, the, speed, of, mass, extinction, events, and, changes, in, sea, level, and, sediment, the, study, suggests, changes, in, ocean, environments, related, to, sea, level, exert, a, driving, influence, on, rates, of, extinction, and, generally, determine, the, composition, of, life, in, the, oceans, the, impact, of, a, sufficiently, large, asteroid, or, comet, could, have, caused, food, chains, to, collapse, both, on, land, and, at, sea, by, producing, dust, and, particulate, aerosols, and, thus, inhibiting, photosynthesis, impacts, on, sulfur, rich, rocks, could, have, emitted, sulfur, oxides, precipitating, as, poisonous, acid, rain, contributing, further, to, the, collapse, of, food, chains, such, impacts, could, also, have, caused, megatsunamis, and, or, global, forest, fires, most, paleontologists, now, agree, that, an, asteroid, did, hit, the, earth, about, 66, ma, but, there, is, lingering, dispute, whether, the, impact, was, the, sole, cause, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, nonetheless, in, october, 2019, researchers, reported, that, the, cretaceous, chicxulub, asteroid, impact, that, resulted, in, the, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, 66, ma, also, rapidly, acidified, the, oceans, producing, ecological, collapse, and, long, lasting, effects, on, the, climate, and, was, a, key, reason, for, end, cretaceous, mass, extinction, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, has, also, been, hypothesised, to, have, been, caused, by, an, asteroid, impact, that, formed, the, araguainha, crater, due, to, the, estimated, date, of, the, crater, s, formation, overlapping, with, the, end, permian, extinction, event, however, this, hypothesis, has, been, widely, challenged, with, the, impact, hypothesis, being, rejected, by, most, researchers, according, to, the, shiva, hypothesis, the, earth, is, subject, to, increased, asteroid, impacts, about, once, every, 27, million, years, because, of, the, sun, s, passage, through, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, thus, causing, extinction, events, at, 27, million, year, intervals, some, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, has, emerged, in, both, marine, and, non, marine, contexts, alternatively, the, sun, s, passage, through, the, higher, density, spiral, arms, of, the, galaxy, could, coincide, with, mass, extinction, on, earth, perhaps, due, to, increased, impact, events, however, a, reanalysis, of, the, effects, of, the, sun, s, transit, through, the, spiral, structure, based, on, maps, of, the, spiral, structure, of, the, milky, way, in, co, molecular, line, emission, has, failed, to, find, a, correlation, a, nearby, gamma, ray, burst, less, than, 6000, light, years, away, would, be, powerful, enough, to, destroy, the, earth, s, ozone, layer, leaving, organisms, vulnerable, to, ultraviolet, radiation, from, the, sun, gamma, ray, bursts, are, fairly, rare, occurring, only, a, few, times, in, a, given, galaxy, per, million, years, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, gamma, ray, burst, caused, the, end, ordovician, extinction, while, a, supernova, has, been, proposed, as, the, cause, of, the, hangenberg, event, a, supernova, within, 25, light, years, would, strip, earth, of, its, atmosphere, today, there, is, in, the, solar, system, s, neighbourhood, no, critical, star, capable, to, produce, a, supernova, dangerous, to, life, on, earth, sustained, and, significant, global, cooling, could, kill, many, polar, and, temperate, species, and, force, others, to, migrate, towards, the, equator, reduce, the, area, available, for, tropical, species, often, make, the, earth, s, climate, more, arid, on, average, mainly, by, locking, up, more, of, the, planet, s, water, in, ice, and, snow, the, glaciation, cycles, of, the, current, ice, age, are, believed, to, have, had, only, a, very, mild, impact, on, biodiversity, so, the, mere, existence, of, a, significant, cooling, is, not, sufficient, on, its, own, to, explain, a, mass, extinction, it, has, been, suggested, that, global, cooling, caused, or, contributed, to, the, end, ordovician, permian, triassic, late, devonian, extinctions, and, possibly, others, sustained, global, cooling, is, distinguished, from, the, temporary, climatic, effects, of, flood, basalt, events, or, impacts, this, would, have, the, opposite, effects, expand, the, area, available, for, tropical, species, kill, temperate, species, or, force, them, to, migrate, towards, the, poles, possibly, cause, severe, extinctions, of, polar, species, often, make, the, earth, s, climate, wetter, on, average, mainly, by, melting, ice, and, snow, and, thus, increasing, the, volume, of, the, water, cycle, it, might, also, cause, anoxic, events, in, the, oceans, see, below, global, warming, as, a, cause, of, mass, extinction, is, supported, by, several, recent, studies, the, most, dramatic, example, of, sustained, warming, is, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, which, was, associated, with, one, of, the, smaller, mass, extinctions, it, has, also, been, suggested, to, have, caused, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, during, which, 20, of, all, marine, families, became, extinct, furthermore, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, has, been, suggested, to, have, been, caused, by, warming, clathrates, are, composites, in, which, a, lattice, of, one, substance, forms, a, cage, around, another, methane, clathrates, in, which, water, molecules, are, the, cage, form, on, continental, shelves, these, clathrates, are, likely, to, break, up, rapidly, and, release, the, methane, if, the, temperature, rises, quickly, or, the, pressure, on, them, drops, quickly, for, example, in, response, to, sudden, global, warming, or, a, sudden, drop, in, sea, level, or, even, earthquakes, methane, is, a, much, more, powerful, greenhouse, gas, than, carbon, dioxide, so, a, methane, eruption, clathrate, gun, could, cause, rapid, global, warming, or, make, it, much, more, severe, if, the, eruption, was, itself, caused, by, global, warming, the, most, likely, signature, of, such, a, methane, eruption, would, be, a, sudden, decrease, in, the, ratio, of, carbon, 13, to, carbon, 12, in, sediments, since, methane, clathrates, are, low, in, carbon, 13, but, the, change, would, have, to, be, very, large, as, other, events, can, also, reduce, the, percentage, of, carbon, 13, it, has, been, suggested, that, clathrate, gun, methane, eruptions, were, involved, in, the, end, permian, extinction, the, great, dying, and, in, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, which, was, associated, with, one, of, the, smaller, mass, extinctions, anoxic, events, are, situations, in, which, the, middle, and, even, the, upper, layers, of, the, ocean, become, deficient, or, totally, lacking, in, oxygen, their, causes, are, complex, and, controversial, but, all, known, instances, are, associated, with, severe, and, sustained, global, warming, mostly, caused, by, sustained, massive, volcanism, it, has, been, suggested, that, anoxic, events, caused, or, contributed, to, the, ordovician, silurian, late, devonian, capitanian, permian, triassic, and, triassic, jurassic, extinctions, as, well, as, a, number, of, lesser, extinctions, such, as, the, ireviken, lundgreni, mulde, lau, smithian, spathian, toarcian, and, cenomanian, turonian, events, on, the, other, hand, there, are, widespread, black, shale, beds, from, the, mid, cretaceous, that, indicate, anoxic, events, but, are, not, associated, with, mass, extinctions, the, bio, availability, of, essential, trace, elements, in, particular, selenium, to, potentially, lethal, lows, has, been, shown, to, coincide, with, and, likely, have, contributed, to, at, least, three, mass, extinction, events, in, the, oceans, that, is, at, the, end, of, the, ordovician, during, the, middle, and, late, devonian, and, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, during, periods, of, low, oxygen, concentrations, very, soluble, selenate, se, 6, is, converted, into, much, less, soluble, selenide, se, 2, elemental, se, and, organo, selenium, complexes, bio, availability, of, selenium, during, these, extinction, events, dropped, to, about, 1, of, the, current, oceanic, concentration, a, level, that, has, been, proven, lethal, to, many, extant, organisms, british, oceanologist, and, atmospheric, scientist, andrew, watson, explained, that, while, the, holocene, epoch, exhibits, many, processes, reminiscent, of, those, that, have, contributed, to, past, anoxic, events, full, scale, ocean, anoxia, would, take, thousands, of, years, to, develop, kump, pavlov, and, arthur, 2005, have, proposed, that, during, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, warming, also, upset, the, oceanic, balance, between, photosynthesising, plankton, and, deep, water, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, causing, massive, emissions, of, hydrogen, sulfide, which, poisoned, life, on, both, land, and, sea, and, severely, weakened, the, ozone, layer, exposing, much, of, the, life, that, still, remained, to, fatal, levels, of, uv, radiation, oceanic, overturn, is, a, disruption, of, thermo, haline, circulation, that, lets, surface, water, which, is, more, saline, than, deep, water, because, of, evaporation, sink, straight, down, bringing, anoxic, deep, water, to, the, surface, and, therefore, killing, most, of, the, oxygen, breathing, organisms, that, inhabit, the, surface, and, middle, depths, it, may, occur, either, at, the, beginning, or, the, end, of, a, glaciation, although, an, overturn, at, the, start, of, a, glaciation, is, more, dangerous, because, the, preceding, warm, period, will, have, created, a, larger, volume, of, anoxic, water, unlike, other, oceanic, catastrophes, such, as, regressions, sea, level, falls, and, anoxic, events, overturns, do, not, leave, easily, identified, signatures, in, rocks, and, are, theoretical, consequences, of, researchers, conclusions, about, other, climatic, and, marine, events, it, has, been, suggested, that, oceanic, overturn, caused, or, contributed, to, the, late, devonian, and, permian, triassic, extinctions, one, theory, is, that, periods, of, increased, geomagnetic, reversals, will, weaken, earth, s, magnetic, field, long, enough, to, expose, the, atmosphere, to, the, solar, winds, causing, oxygen, ions, to, escape, the, atmosphere, in, a, rate, increased, by, 3, 4, orders, resulting, in, a, disastrous, decrease, in, oxygen, movement, of, the, continents, into, some, configurations, can, cause, or, contribute, to, extinctions, in, several, ways, by, initiating, or, ending, ice, ages, by, changing, ocean, and, wind, currents, and, thus, altering, climate, by, opening, seaways, or, land, bridges, that, expose, previously, isolated, species, to, competition, for, which, they, are, poorly, adapted, for, example, the, extinction, of, most, of, south, america, s, native, ungulates, and, all, of, its, large, metatherians, after, the, creation, of, a, land, bridge, between, north, and, south, america, occasionally, continental, drift, creates, a, super, continent, that, includes, the, vast, majority, of, earth, s, land, area, which, in, addition, to, the, effects, listed, above, is, likely, to, reduce, the, total, area, of, continental, shelf, the, most, species, rich, part, of, the, ocean, and, produce, a, vast, arid, continental, interior, that, may, have, extreme, seasonal, variations, another, theory, is, that, the, creation, of, the, super, continent, pangaea, contributed, to, the, end, permian, mass, extinction, pangaea, was, almost, fully, formed, at, the, transition, from, mid, permian, to, late, permian, and, the, marine, genus, diversity, diagram, at, the, top, of, this, article, shows, a, level, of, extinction, starting, at, that, time, which, might, have, qualified, for, inclusion, in, the, big, five, if, it, were, not, overshadowed, by, the, great, dying, at, the, end, of, the, permian, many, other, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, such, as, the, spread, of, a, new, disease, or, simple, out, competition, following, an, especially, successful, biological, innovation, but, all, have, been, rejected, usually, for, one, of, the, following, reasons, they, require, events, or, processes, for, which, there, is, no, evidence, they, assume, mechanisms, that, are, contrary, to, the, available, evidence, they, are, based, on, other, theories, that, have, been, rejected, or, superseded, scientists, have, been, concerned, that, human, activities, could, cause, more, plants, and, animals, to, become, extinct, than, any, point, in, the, past, along, with, human, made, changes, in, climate, see, above, some, of, these, extinctions, could, be, caused, by, overhunting, overfishing, invasive, species, or, habitat, loss, a, study, published, in, may, 2017, in, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, argued, that, a, biological, annihilation, akin, to, a, sixth, mass, extinction, event, is, underway, as, a, result, of, anthropogenic, causes, such, as, over, population, and, over, consumption, the, study, suggested, that, as, much, as, 50, of, the, number, of, animal, individuals, that, once, lived, on, earth, were, already, extinct, threatening, the, basis, for, human, existence, too, the, eventual, warming, and, expanding, of, the, sun, combined, with, the, eventual, decline, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, could, actually, cause, an, even, greater, mass, extinction, having, the, potential, to, wipe, out, even, microbes, in, other, words, the, earth, would, be, completely, sterilized, rising, global, temperatures, caused, by, the, expanding, sun, would, gradually, increase, the, rate, of, weathering, which, would, in, turn, remove, more, and, more, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, when, co, 2, levels, get, too, low, perhaps, at, 50, ppm, most, plant, life, will, die, out, although, simpler, plants, like, grasses, and, mosses, can, survive, much, longer, until, co, 2, levels, drop, to, 10, ppm, with, all, photosynthetic, organisms, gone, atmospheric, oxygen, can, no, longer, be, replenished, and, it, is, eventually, removed, by, chemical, reactions, in, the, atmosphere, perhaps, from, volcanic, eruptions, eventually, the, loss, of, oxygen, will, cause, all, remaining, aerobic, life, to, die, out, via, asphyxiation, leaving, behind, only, simple, anaerobic, prokaryotes, when, the, sun, becomes, 10, brighter, in, about, a, billion, years, earth, will, suffer, a, moist, greenhouse, effect, resulting, in, its, oceans, boiling, away, while, the, earth, s, liquid, outer, core, cools, due, to, the, inner, core, s, expansion, and, causes, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, to, shut, down, in, the, absence, of, a, magnetic, field, charged, particles, from, the, sun, will, deplete, the, atmosphere, and, further, increase, the, earth, s, temperature, to, an, average, of, around, 420, k, 147, c, 296, f, in, 2, 8, billion, years, causing, the, last, remaining, life, on, earth, to, die, out, this, is, the, most, extreme, instance, of, a, climate, caused, extinction, event, since, this, will, only, happen, late, in, the, sun, s, life, it, would, represent, the, final, mass, extinction, in, earth, s, history, albeit, a, very, long, extinction, event, the, effects, of, mass, extinction, events, varied, widely, after, a, major, extinction, event, usually, only, weedy, species, survive, due, to, their, ability, to, live, in, diverse, habitats, later, species, diversify, and, occupy, empty, niches, generally, it, takes, millions, of, years, for, biodiversity, to, recover, after, extinction, events, in, the, most, severe, mass, extinctions, it, may, take, 15, to, 30, million, years, the, worst, phanerozoic, event, the, permian, triassic, extinction, devastated, life, on, earth, killing, over, 90, of, species, life, seemed, to, recover, quickly, after, the, p, t, extinction, but, this, was, mostly, in, the, form, of, disaster, taxa, such, as, the, hardy, lystrosaurus, the, most, recent, research, indicates, that, the, specialized, animals, that, formed, complex, ecosystems, with, high, biodiversity, complex, food, webs, and, a, variety, of, niches, took, much, longer, to, recover, it, is, thought, that, this, long, recovery, was, due, to, successive, waves, of, extinction, that, inhibited, recovery, as, well, as, prolonged, environmental, stress, that, continued, into, the, early, triassic, recent, research, indicates, that, recovery, did, not, begin, until, the, start, of, the, mid, triassic, four, to, six, million, years, after, the, extinction, and, some, writers, estimate, that, the, recovery, was, not, complete, until, 30, million, years, after, the, p, t, extinction, that, is, in, the, late, triassic, subsequent, to, the, p, t, extinction, there, was, an, increase, in, provincialization, with, species, occupying, smaller, ranges, perhaps, removing, incumbents, from, niches, and, setting, the, stage, for, an, eventual, rediversification, the, effects, of, mass, extinctions, on, plants, are, somewhat, harder, to, quantify, given, the, biases, inherent, in, the, plant, fossil, record, some, mass, extinctions, such, as, the, end, permian, were, equally, catastrophic, for, plants, whereas, others, such, as, the, end, devonian, did, not, affect, the, flora, the, term, extinction, level, event, ele, has, been, used, in, media, the, 1998, film, deep, impact, describes, a, potential, comet, strike, of, earth, as, an, e, l, e
