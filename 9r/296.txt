in, physics, and, chemistry, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, or, principle, of, mass, conservation, states, that, for, any, system, closed, to, all, transfers, of, matter, and, energy, the, mass, of, the, system, must, remain, constant, over, time, the, law, implies, that, mass, can, neither, be, created, nor, destroyed, although, it, may, be, rearranged, in, space, or, the, entities, associated, with, it, may, be, changed, in, form, for, example, in, chemical, reactions, the, mass, of, the, chemical, components, before, the, reaction, is, equal, to, the, mass, of, the, components, after, the, reaction, thus, during, any, chemical, reaction, and, low, energy, thermodynamic, processes, in, an, isolated, system, the, total, mass, of, the, reactants, or, starting, materials, must, be, equal, to, the, mass, of, the, products, the, concept, of, mass, conservation, is, widely, used, in, many, fields, such, as, chemistry, mechanics, and, fluid, dynamics, historically, mass, conservation, in, chemical, reactions, was, primarily, demonstrated, in, the, 17th, century, and, finally, confirmed, by, antoine, lavoisier, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, formulation, of, this, law, was, of, crucial, importance, in, the, progress, from, alchemy, to, the, modern, natural, science, of, chemistry, in, reality, the, conservation, of, mass, only, holds, approximately, and, is, considered, part, of, a, series, of, assumptions, in, classical, mechanics, the, law, has, to, be, modified, to, comply, with, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, and, special, relativity, under, the, principle, of, mass, energy, equivalence, which, states, that, energy, and, mass, form, one, conserved, quantity, for, very, energetic, systems, the, conservation, of, mass, only, is, shown, not, to, hold, as, is, the, case, in, nuclear, reactions, and, particle, antiparticle, annihilation, in, particle, physics, mass, is, also, not, generally, conserved, in, open, systems, such, is, the, case, when, any, energy, or, matter, is, allowed, into, or, out, of, the, system, however, unless, radioactivity, or, nuclear, reactions, are, involved, the, amount, of, energy, entering, or, escaping, such, systems, as, heat, mechanical, work, or, electromagnetic, radiation, is, usually, too, small, to, be, measured, as, a, change, in, the, mass, of, the, system, for, systems, that, include, large, gravitational, fields, general, relativity, has, to, be, taken, into, account, thus, mass, energy, conservation, becomes, a, more, complex, concept, subject, to, different, definitions, and, neither, mass, nor, energy, is, as, strictly, and, simply, conserved, as, is, the, case, in, special, relativity, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, can, only, be, formulated, in, classical, mechanics, in, which, the, energy, scales, associated, with, an, isolated, system, are, much, smaller, than, m, c, 2, displaystyle, mc, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, a, typical, object, in, the, system, measured, in, the, frame, of, reference, where, the, object, is, at, rest, and, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, the, law, can, be, formulated, mathematically, in, the, fields, of, fluid, mechanics, and, continuum, mechanics, where, the, conservation, of, mass, is, usually, expressed, using, the, continuity, equation, given, in, differential, form, as, t, v, 0, displaystyle, frac, partial, rho, partial, t, nabla, cdot, rho, mathbf, v, 0, where, textstyle, rho, is, the, density, mass, per, unit, volume, t, textstyle, t, is, the, time, textstyle, nabla, cdot, is, the, divergence, and, v, textstyle, mathbf, v, is, the, flow, velocity, field, the, interpretation, of, the, continuity, equation, for, mass, is, the, following, for, a, given, closed, surface, in, the, system, the, change, over, any, time, interval, of, the, mass, enclosed, by, the, surface, is, equal, to, the, mass, that, traverses, the, surface, during, that, time, interval, positive, if, the, matter, goes, in, and, negative, if, the, matter, goes, out, for, the, whole, isolated, system, this, condition, implies, that, the, total, mass, m, textstyle, m, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, all, components, in, the, system, does, not, change, over, time, i, e, d, m, d, t, d, d, t, d, v, 0, displaystyle, frac, text, d, m, text, d, t, frac, text, d, text, d, t, int, rho, text, d, v, 0, where, d, v, textstyle, text, d, v, is, the, differential, that, defines, the, integral, over, the, whole, volume, of, the, system, the, continuity, equation, for, the, mass, is, part, of, the, euler, equations, of, fluid, dynamics, many, other, convection, diffusion, equations, describe, the, conservation, and, flow, of, mass, and, matter, in, a, given, system, in, chemistry, the, calculation, of, the, amount, of, reactant, and, products, in, a, chemical, reaction, or, stoichiometry, is, founded, on, the, principle, of, conservation, of, mass, the, principle, implies, that, during, a, chemical, reaction, the, total, mass, of, the, reactants, is, equal, to, the, total, mass, of, the, products, for, example, in, the, following, reaction, where, one, molecule, of, methane, ch, 4, and, two, oxygen, molecules, o, 2, are, converted, into, one, molecule, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, two, of, water, h, 2, o, the, number, of, molecules, resulting, from, the, reaction, can, be, derived, from, the, principle, of, conservation, of, mass, as, initially, four, hydrogen, atoms, 4, oxygen, atoms, and, one, carbon, atom, are, present, as, well, as, in, the, final, state, thus, the, number, water, molecules, produced, must, be, exactly, two, per, molecule, of, carbon, dioxide, produced, many, engineering, problems, are, solved, by, following, the, mass, distribution, of, a, given, system, over, time, this, methodology, is, known, as, mass, balance, as, early, as, 520, bce, jain, philosophy, a, non, creationist, philosophy, based, on, the, teachings, of, mahavira, stated, that, the, universe, and, its, constituents, such, as, matter, cannot, be, destroyed, or, created, the, jain, text, tattvarthasutra, 2nd, century, ce, states, that, a, substance, is, permanent, but, its, modes, are, characterised, by, creation, and, destruction, an, important, idea, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, was, that, nothing, comes, from, nothing, so, that, what, exists, now, has, always, existed, no, new, matter, can, come, into, existence, where, there, was, none, before, an, explicit, statement, of, this, along, with, the, further, principle, that, nothing, can, pass, away, into, nothing, is, found, in, empedocles, c, 4th, century, bce, for, it, is, impossible, for, anything, to, come, to, be, from, what, is, not, and, it, cannot, be, brought, about, or, heard, of, that, what, is, should, be, utterly, destroyed, a, further, principle, of, conservation, was, stated, by, epicurus, around, the, 3rd, century, bce, who, wrote, in, describing, the, nature, of, the, universe, that, the, totality, of, things, was, always, such, as, it, is, now, and, always, will, be, by, the, 18th, century, the, principle, of, conservation, of, mass, during, chemical, reactions, was, widely, used, and, was, an, important, assumption, during, experiments, even, before, a, definition, was, widely, established, though, an, expression, of, the, law, can, be, dated, back, to, hero, of, alexandria, s, time, as, can, be, seen, in, the, works, of, joseph, black, henry, cavendish, and, jean, rey, one, of, the, first, to, outline, the, principle, was, mikhail, lomonosov, in, 1756, he, may, have, demonstrated, it, by, experiments, and, certainly, had, discussed, the, principle, in, 1748, in, correspondence, with, leonhard, euler, though, his, claim, on, the, subject, is, sometimes, challenged, according, to, the, soviet, physicist, yakov, dorfman, the, universal, law, was, formulated, by, lomonosov, on, the, basis, of, general, philosophical, materialistic, considerations, it, was, never, questioned, or, tested, by, him, but, on, the, contrary, served, him, as, a, solid, starting, position, in, all, research, throughout, his, life, a, more, refined, series, of, experiments, were, later, carried, out, by, antoine, lavoisier, who, expressed, his, conclusion, in, 1773, and, popularized, the, principle, of, conservation, of, mass, the, demonstrations, of, the, principle, disproved, the, then, popular, phlogiston, theory, that, said, that, mass, could, be, gained, or, lost, in, combustion, and, heat, processes, the, conservation, of, mass, was, obscure, for, millennia, because, of, the, buoyancy, effect, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, on, the, weight, of, gases, for, example, a, piece, of, wood, weighs, less, after, burning, this, seemed, to, suggest, that, some, of, its, mass, disappears, or, is, transformed, or, lost, this, was, not, disproved, until, careful, experiments, were, performed, in, which, chemical, reactions, such, as, rusting, were, allowed, to, take, place, in, sealed, glass, ampoules, it, was, found, that, the, chemical, reaction, did, not, change, the, weight, of, the, sealed, container, and, its, contents, weighing, of, gases, using, scales, was, not, possible, until, the, invention, of, the, vacuum, pump, in, the, 17th, century, once, understood, the, conservation, of, mass, was, of, great, importance, in, progressing, from, alchemy, to, modern, chemistry, once, early, chemists, realized, that, chemical, substances, never, disappeared, but, were, only, transformed, into, other, substances, with, the, same, weight, these, scientists, could, for, the, first, time, embark, on, quantitative, studies, of, the, transformations, of, substances, the, idea, of, mass, conservation, plus, a, surmise, that, certain, elemental, substances, also, could, not, be, transformed, into, others, by, chemical, reactions, in, turn, led, to, an, understanding, of, chemical, elements, as, well, as, the, idea, that, all, chemical, processes, and, transformations, such, as, burning, and, metabolic, reactions, are, reactions, between, invariant, amounts, or, weights, of, these, chemical, elements, following, the, pioneering, work, of, lavoisier, the, exhaustive, experiments, of, jean, stas, supported, the, consistency, of, this, law, in, chemical, reactions, even, though, they, were, carried, out, with, other, intentions, his, research, indicated, that, in, certain, reactions, the, loss, or, gain, could, not, have, been, more, than, 2, to, 4, parts, in, 100, 000, the, difference, in, the, accuracy, aimed, at, and, attained, by, lavoisier, on, the, one, hand, and, by, morley, and, stas, on, the, other, is, enormous, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, was, challenged, with, the, advent, of, special, relativity, in, one, of, the, annus, mirabilis, papers, of, albert, einstein, in, 1905, he, suggested, an, equivalence, between, mass, and, energy, this, theory, implied, several, assertions, like, the, idea, that, internal, energy, of, a, system, could, contribute, to, the, mass, of, the, whole, system, or, that, mass, could, be, converted, into, electromagnetic, radiation, however, as, max, planck, pointed, out, a, change, in, mass, as, a, result, of, extraction, or, addition, of, chemical, energy, as, predicted, by, einstein, s, theory, is, so, small, that, it, could, not, be, measured, with, the, available, instruments, and, could, not, be, presented, as, a, test, of, special, relativity, einstein, speculated, that, the, energies, associated, with, newly, discovered, radioactivity, were, significant, enough, compared, with, the, mass, of, systems, producing, them, to, enable, their, change, of, mass, to, be, measured, once, the, energy, of, the, reaction, had, been, removed, from, the, system, this, later, indeed, proved, to, be, possible, although, it, was, eventually, to, be, the, first, artificial, nuclear, transmutation, reaction, in, 1932, demonstrated, by, cockcroft, and, walton, that, proved, the, first, successful, test, of, einstein, s, theory, regarding, mass, loss, with, energy, gain, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, and, the, analogous, law, of, conservation, of, energy, were, finally, generalized, and, unified, into, the, principle, of, mass, energy, equivalence, described, by, albert, einstein, s, equation, e, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, mc, 2, special, relativity, also, redefines, the, concept, of, mass, and, energy, which, can, be, used, interchangeably, and, are, defined, relative, to, the, frame, of, reference, several, quantities, had, to, be, defined, for, consistency, such, as, the, rest, mass, of, a, particle, mass, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, particle, and, the, relativistic, mass, in, another, frame, the, latter, term, is, usually, less, frequently, used, in, special, relativity, the, conservation, of, mass, does, not, apply, if, the, system, is, open, and, energy, escapes, however, it, does, continue, to, apply, to, totally, closed, isolated, systems, if, energy, cannot, escape, a, system, its, mass, cannot, decrease, in, relativity, theory, so, long, as, any, type, of, energy, is, retained, within, a, system, this, energy, exhibits, mass, also, mass, must, be, differentiated, from, matter, since, matter, may, not, be, perfectly, conserved, in, isolated, systems, even, though, mass, is, always, conserved, in, such, systems, however, matter, is, so, nearly, conserved, in, chemistry, that, violations, of, matter, conservation, were, not, measured, until, the, nuclear, age, and, the, assumption, of, matter, conservation, remains, an, important, practical, concept, in, most, systems, in, chemistry, and, other, studies, that, do, not, involve, the, high, energies, typical, of, radioactivity, and, nuclear, reactions, the, change, in, mass, of, certain, kinds, of, open, systems, where, atoms, or, massive, particles, are, not, allowed, to, escape, but, other, types, of, energy, such, as, light, or, heat, are, allowed, to, enter, escape, or, be, merged, went, unnoticed, during, the, 19th, century, because, the, change, in, mass, associated, with, addition, or, loss, of, small, quantities, of, thermal, or, radiant, energy, in, chemical, reactions, is, very, small, in, theory, mass, would, not, change, at, all, for, experiments, conducted, in, isolated, systems, where, heat, and, work, were, not, allowed, in, or, out, the, conservation, of, relativistic, mass, implies, the, viewpoint, of, a, single, observer, or, the, view, from, a, single, inertial, frame, since, changing, inertial, frames, may, result, in, a, change, of, the, total, energy, relativistic, energy, for, systems, and, this, quantity, determines, the, relativistic, mass, the, principle, that, the, mass, of, a, system, of, particles, must, be, equal, to, the, sum, of, their, rest, masses, though, true, in, classical, physics, may, be, false, in, special, relativity, rest, masses, cannot, be, summed, to, derive, the, total, mass, of, a, system, because, this, practice, does, not, take, into, account, other, forms, of, energy, such, as, kinetic, energy, potential, energy, and, the, energy, of, massless, particles, such, as, photons, all, forms, of, energy, in, a, system, affect, the, total, mass, of, the, system, for, moving, massive, particles, in, a, system, examining, the, rest, masses, of, the, various, particles, also, amounts, to, introducing, many, different, inertial, observation, frames, which, is, prohibited, if, total, system, energy, and, momentum, are, to, be, conserved, additionally, in, the, rest, frame, of, any, one, particle, this, procedure, ignores, the, momenta, of, other, particles, which, affect, the, system, mass, if, the, other, particles, are, in, motion, in, this, frame, for, the, special, type, of, mass, called, invariant, mass, changing, the, inertial, frame, of, observation, for, a, whole, closed, system, has, no, effect, on, the, measure, of, invariant, mass, of, the, system, which, remains, both, conserved, and, invariant, unchanging, even, for, different, observers, who, view, the, entire, system, invariant, mass, is, a, system, combination, of, energy, and, momentum, which, is, invariant, for, any, observer, because, in, any, inertial, frame, the, energies, and, momenta, of, the, various, particles, always, add, to, the, same, quantity, the, momentum, may, be, negative, so, the, addition, amounts, to, a, subtraction, the, invariant, mass, is, the, relativistic, mass, of, the, system, when, viewed, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, it, is, the, minimum, mass, which, a, system, may, exhibit, as, viewed, from, all, possible, inertial, frames, the, conservation, of, both, relativistic, and, invariant, mass, applies, even, to, systems, of, particles, created, by, pair, production, where, energy, for, new, particles, may, come, from, kinetic, energy, of, other, particles, or, from, one, or, more, photons, as, part, of, a, system, that, includes, other, particles, besides, a, photon, again, neither, the, relativistic, nor, the, invariant, mass, of, totally, closed, that, is, isolated, systems, changes, when, new, particles, are, created, however, different, inertial, observers, will, disagree, on, the, value, of, this, conserved, mass, if, it, is, the, relativistic, mass, i, e, relativistic, mass, is, conserved, but, not, invariant, however, all, observers, agree, on, the, value, of, the, conserved, mass, if, the, mass, being, measured, is, the, invariant, mass, i, e, invariant, mass, is, both, conserved, and, invariant, the, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, gives, a, different, prediction, in, non, isolated, systems, since, if, energy, is, allowed, to, escape, a, system, both, relativistic, mass, and, invariant, mass, will, escape, also, in, this, case, the, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, predicts, that, the, change, in, mass, of, a, system, is, associated, with, the, change, in, its, energy, due, to, energy, being, added, or, subtracted, m, e, c, 2, displaystyle, delta, m, delta, e, c, 2, this, form, of, the, equation, in, terms, of, changes, was, the, form, in, which, it, was, originally, presented, by, einstein, in, this, sense, mass, changes, in, any, system, are, explained, if, the, mass, of, the, energy, added, or, removed, from, the, system, is, taken, into, account, the, formula, implies, that, bound, systems, have, an, invariant, mass, rest, mass, for, the, system, less, than, the, sum, of, their, parts, if, the, binding, energy, has, been, allowed, to, escape, the, system, after, the, system, has, been, bound, this, may, happen, by, converting, system, potential, energy, into, some, other, kind, of, active, energy, such, as, kinetic, energy, or, photons, which, easily, escape, a, bound, system, the, difference, in, system, masses, called, a, mass, defect, is, a, measure, of, the, binding, energy, in, bound, systems, in, other, words, the, energy, needed, to, break, the, system, apart, the, greater, the, mass, defect, the, larger, the, binding, energy, the, binding, energy, which, itself, has, mass, must, be, released, as, light, or, heat, when, the, parts, combine, to, form, the, bound, system, and, this, is, the, reason, the, mass, of, the, bound, system, decreases, when, the, energy, leaves, the, system, the, total, invariant, mass, is, actually, conserved, when, the, mass, of, the, binding, energy, that, has, escaped, is, taken, into, account, in, general, relativity, the, total, invariant, mass, of, photons, in, an, expanding, volume, of, space, will, decrease, due, to, the, red, shift, of, such, an, expansion, the, conservation, of, both, mass, and, energy, therefore, depends, on, various, corrections, made, to, energy, in, the, theory, due, to, the, changing, gravitational, potential, energy, of, such, systems
