methane, us, m, e, n, meth, ayn, uk, m, i, e, n, mee, thayn, is, a, chemical, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, ch, 4, one, carbon, atom, bonded, to, four, hydrogen, atoms, it, is, a, group, 14, hydride, the, simplest, alkane, and, the, main, constituent, of, natural, gas, the, abundance, of, methane, on, earth, makes, it, an, economically, attractive, fuel, although, capturing, and, storing, it, is, difficult, because, it, is, a, gas, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, naturally, occurring, methane, is, found, both, below, ground, and, under, the, seafloor, and, is, formed, by, both, geological, and, biological, processes, the, largest, reservoir, of, methane, is, under, the, seafloor, in, the, form, of, methane, clathrates, when, methane, reaches, the, surface, and, the, atmosphere, it, is, known, as, atmospheric, methane, the, earth, s, atmospheric, methane, concentration, has, increased, by, about, 160, since, 1750, with, the, overwhelming, percentage, caused, by, human, activity, it, accounted, for, 20, of, the, total, radiative, forcing, from, all, of, the, long, lived, and, globally, mixed, greenhouse, gases, according, to, the, 2021, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, report, strong, rapid, and, sustained, reductions, in, methane, emissions, could, limit, near, term, warming, and, improve, air, quality, by, reducing, global, surface, ozone, methane, has, also, been, detected, on, other, planets, including, mars, which, has, implications, for, astrobiology, research, methane, is, a, tetrahedral, molecule, with, four, equivalent, c, h, bonds, its, electronic, structure, is, described, by, four, bonding, molecular, orbitals, mos, resulting, from, the, overlap, of, the, valence, orbitals, on, c, and, h, the, lowest, energy, mo, is, the, result, of, the, overlap, of, the, 2s, orbital, on, carbon, with, the, in, phase, combination, of, the, 1s, orbitals, on, the, four, hydrogen, atoms, above, this, energy, level, is, a, triply, degenerate, set, of, mos, that, involve, overlap, of, the, 2p, orbitals, on, carbon, with, various, linear, combinations, of, the, 1s, orbitals, on, hydrogen, the, resulting, three, over, one, bonding, scheme, is, consistent, with, photoelectron, spectroscopic, measurements, methane, is, an, odorless, colourless, and, transparent, gas, it, does, absorb, visible, light, especially, at, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, due, to, overtone, bands, but, the, effect, is, only, noticeable, if, the, light, path, is, very, long, this, is, what, gives, uranus, and, neptune, their, blue, or, bluish, green, colors, as, light, passes, through, their, atmospheres, containing, methane, and, is, then, scattered, back, out, the, familiar, smell, of, natural, gas, as, used, in, homes, is, achieved, by, the, addition, of, an, odorant, usually, blends, containing, tert, butylthiol, as, a, safety, measure, methane, has, a, boiling, point, of, 161, 5, c, at, a, pressure, of, one, atmosphere, as, a, gas, it, is, flammable, over, a, range, of, concentrations, 5, 4, 17, in, air, at, standard, pressure, solid, methane, exists, in, several, modifications, presently, nine, are, known, cooling, methane, at, normal, pressure, results, in, the, formation, of, methane, i, this, substance, crystallizes, in, the, cubic, system, space, group, fm, 3, m, the, positions, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, are, not, fixed, in, methane, i, i, e, methane, molecules, may, rotate, freely, therefore, it, is, a, plastic, crystal, the, primary, chemical, reactions, of, methane, are, combustion, steam, reforming, to, syngas, and, halogenation, in, general, methane, reactions, are, difficult, to, control, partial, oxidation, of, methane, to, methanol, c, h, 3, o, h, a, more, convenient, liquid, fuel, is, challenging, because, the, reaction, typically, progresses, all, the, way, to, carbon, dioxide, and, water, even, with, an, insufficient, supply, of, oxygen, the, enzyme, methane, monooxygenase, produces, methanol, from, methane, but, cannot, be, used, for, industrial, scale, reactions, some, homogeneously, catalyzed, systems, and, heterogeneous, systems, have, been, developed, but, all, have, significant, drawbacks, these, generally, operate, by, generating, protected, products, which, are, shielded, from, overoxidation, examples, include, the, catalytica, system, copper, zeolites, and, iron, zeolites, stabilizing, the, alpha, oxygen, active, site, one, group, of, bacteria, catalyze, methane, oxidation, with, nitrite, as, the, oxidant, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, giving, rise, to, the, so, called, anaerobic, oxidation, of, methane, like, other, hydrocarbons, methane, is, an, extremely, weak, acid, its, p, k, a, in, dmso, is, estimated, to, be, 56, it, cannot, be, deprotonated, in, solution, but, the, conjugate, base, is, known, in, forms, such, as, methyllithium, a, variety, of, positive, ions, derived, from, methane, have, been, observed, mostly, as, unstable, species, in, low, pressure, gas, mixtures, these, include, methenium, or, methyl, cation, ch, 3, methane, cation, ch, 4, and, methanium, or, protonated, methane, ch, 5, some, of, these, have, been, detected, in, outer, space, methanium, can, also, be, produced, as, diluted, solutions, from, methane, with, superacids, cations, with, higher, charge, such, as, ch, 2, 6, and, ch, 3, 7, have, been, studied, theoretically, and, conjectured, to, be, stable, despite, the, strength, of, its, c, h, bonds, there, is, intense, interest, in, catalysts, that, facilitate, c, h, bond, activation, in, methane, and, other, lower, numbered, alkanes, methane, s, heat, of, combustion, is, 55, 5, mj, kg, combustion, of, methane, is, a, multiple, step, reaction, summarized, as, follows, peters, four, step, chemistry, is, a, systematically, reduced, four, step, chemistry, that, explains, the, burning, of, methane, given, appropriate, conditions, methane, reacts, with, halogen, radicals, as, follows, where, x, is, a, halogen, fluorine, f, chlorine, cl, bromine, br, or, iodine, i, this, mechanism, for, this, process, is, called, free, radical, halogenation, it, is, initiated, when, uv, light, or, some, other, radical, initiator, like, peroxides, produces, a, halogen, atom, a, two, step, chain, reaction, ensues, in, which, the, halogen, atom, abstracts, a, hydrogen, atom, from, a, methane, molecule, resulting, in, the, formation, of, a, hydrogen, halide, molecule, and, a, methyl, radical, ch, 3, the, methyl, radical, then, reacts, with, a, molecule, of, the, halogen, to, form, a, molecule, of, the, halomethane, with, a, new, halogen, atom, as, byproduct, similar, reactions, can, occur, on, the, halogenated, product, leading, to, replacement, of, additional, hydrogen, atoms, by, halogen, atoms, with, dihalomethane, trihalomethane, and, ultimately, tetrahalomethane, structures, depending, upon, reaction, conditions, and, the, halogen, to, methane, ratio, this, reaction, is, commonly, used, with, chlorine, to, produce, dichloromethane, and, chloroform, via, chloromethane, carbon, tetrachloride, can, be, made, with, excess, chlorine, methane, may, be, transported, as, a, refrigerated, liquid, liquefied, natural, gas, or, lng, while, leaks, from, a, refrigerated, liquid, container, are, initially, heavier, than, air, due, to, the, increased, density, of, the, cold, gas, the, gas, at, ambient, temperature, is, lighter, than, air, gas, pipelines, distribute, large, amounts, of, natural, gas, of, which, methane, is, the, principal, component, methane, is, used, as, a, fuel, for, ovens, homes, water, heaters, kilns, automobiles, turbines, etc, as, the, major, constituent, of, natural, gas, methane, is, important, for, electricity, generation, by, burning, it, as, a, fuel, in, a, gas, turbine, or, steam, generator, compared, to, other, hydrocarbon, fuels, methane, produces, less, carbon, dioxide, for, each, unit, of, heat, released, at, about, 891, kj, mol, methane, s, heat, of, combustion, is, lower, than, that, of, any, other, hydrocarbon, but, the, ratio, of, the, heat, of, combustion, 891, kj, mol, to, the, molecular, mass, 16, 0, g, mol, of, which, 12, 0, g, mol, is, carbon, shows, that, methane, being, the, simplest, hydrocarbon, produces, more, heat, per, mass, unit, 55, 7, kj, g, than, other, complex, hydrocarbons, in, many, areas, with, a, dense, enough, population, methane, is, piped, into, homes, and, businesses, for, heating, cooking, and, industrial, uses, in, this, context, it, is, usually, known, as, natural, gas, which, is, considered, to, have, an, energy, content, of, 39, megajoules, per, cubic, meter, or, 1, 000, btu, per, standard, cubic, foot, liquefied, natural, gas, lng, is, predominantly, methane, ch, 4, converted, into, liquid, form, for, ease, of, storage, or, transport, refined, liquid, methane, as, well, as, lng, is, used, as, a, rocket, fuel, when, combined, with, liquid, oxygen, as, in, the, tq, 12, be, 4, raptor, and, yf, 215, engines, due, to, the, similarities, between, methane, and, lng, such, engines, are, commonly, grouped, together, under, the, term, methalox, as, a, liquid, rocket, propellant, a, methane, liquid, oxygen, combination, offers, the, advantage, over, kerosene, liquid, oxygen, combination, or, kerolox, of, producing, small, exhaust, molecules, reducing, coking, or, deposition, of, soot, on, engine, components, methane, is, easier, to, store, than, hydrogen, due, to, its, higher, boiling, point, and, density, as, well, as, its, lack, of, hydrogen, embrittlement, the, lower, molecular, weight, of, the, exhaust, also, increases, the, fraction, of, the, heat, energy, which, is, in, the, form, of, kinetic, energy, available, for, propulsion, increasing, the, specific, impulse, of, the, rocket, compared, to, liquid, hydrogen, the, specific, energy, of, methane, is, lower, but, this, disadvantage, is, offset, by, methane, s, greater, density, and, temperature, range, allowing, for, smaller, and, lighter, tankage, for, a, given, fuel, mass, liquid, methane, has, a, temperature, range, 91, 112, k, nearly, compatible, with, liquid, oxygen, 54, 90, k, the, fuel, currently, sees, use, in, operational, launch, vehicles, such, as, zhuque, 2, and, vulcan, as, well, as, in, development, launchers, such, as, starship, neutron, and, terran, r, natural, gas, which, is, mostly, composed, of, methane, is, used, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, on, an, industrial, scale, steam, methane, reforming, smr, or, simply, known, as, steam, reforming, is, the, standard, industrial, method, of, producing, commercial, bulk, hydrogen, gas, more, than, 50, million, metric, tons, are, produced, annually, worldwide, 2013, principally, from, the, smr, of, natural, gas, much, of, this, hydrogen, is, used, in, petroleum, refineries, in, the, production, of, chemicals, and, in, food, processing, very, large, quantities, of, hydrogen, are, used, in, the, industrial, synthesis, of, ammonia, at, high, temperatures, 700, 1100, c, and, in, the, presence, of, a, metal, based, catalyst, nickel, steam, reacts, with, methane, to, yield, a, mixture, of, co, and, h, 2, known, as, water, gas, or, syngas, this, reaction, is, strongly, endothermic, consumes, heat, h, r, 206, kj, mol, additional, hydrogen, is, obtained, by, the, reaction, of, co, with, water, via, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, this, reaction, is, mildly, exothermic, produces, heat, h, r, 41, kj, mol, methane, is, also, subjected, to, free, radical, chlorination, in, the, production, of, chloromethanes, although, methanol, is, a, more, typical, precursor, hydrogen, can, also, be, produced, via, the, direct, decomposition, of, methane, also, known, as, methane, pyrolysis, which, unlike, steam, reforming, produces, no, greenhouse, gases, ghg, the, heat, needed, for, the, reaction, can, also, be, ghg, emission, free, e, g, from, concentrated, sunlight, renewable, electricity, or, burning, some, of, the, produced, hydrogen, if, the, methane, is, from, biogas, then, the, process, can, be, a, carbon, sink, temperatures, in, excess, of, 1200, c, are, required, to, break, the, bonds, of, methane, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, and, solid, carbon, however, through, the, use, of, a, suitable, catalyst, the, reaction, temperature, can, be, reduced, to, between, 600, c, 1000, c, depending, on, the, chosen, catalyst, the, reaction, is, moderately, endothermic, as, shown, in, the, reaction, equation, below, as, a, refrigerant, methane, has, the, ashrae, designation, r, 50, methane, can, be, generated, through, geological, biological, or, industrial, routes, the, two, main, routes, for, geological, methane, generation, are, i, organic, thermally, generated, or, thermogenic, and, ii, inorganic, abiotic, thermogenic, methane, occurs, due, to, the, breakup, of, organic, matter, at, elevated, temperatures, and, pressures, in, deep, sedimentary, strata, most, methane, in, sedimentary, basins, is, thermogenic, therefore, thermogenic, methane, is, the, most, important, source, of, natural, gas, thermogenic, methane, components, are, typically, considered, to, be, relic, from, an, earlier, time, generally, formation, of, thermogenic, methane, at, depth, can, occur, through, organic, matter, breakup, or, organic, synthesis, both, ways, can, involve, microorganisms, methanogenesis, but, may, also, occur, inorganically, the, processes, involved, can, also, consume, methane, with, and, without, microorganisms, the, more, important, source, of, methane, at, depth, crystalline, bedrock, is, abiotic, abiotic, means, that, methane, is, created, from, inorganic, compounds, without, biological, activity, either, through, magmatic, processes, or, via, water, rock, reactions, that, occur, at, low, temperatures, and, pressures, like, serpentinization, most, of, earth, s, methane, is, biogenic, and, is, produced, by, methanogenesis, a, form, of, anaerobic, respiration, only, known, to, be, conducted, by, some, members, of, the, domain, archaea, methanogens, occur, in, landfills, and, soils, ruminants, for, example, cattle, the, guts, of, termites, and, the, anoxic, sediments, below, the, seafloor, and, the, bottom, of, lakes, this, multistep, process, is, used, by, these, microorganisms, for, energy, the, net, reaction, of, methanogenesis, is, the, final, step, in, the, process, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, methyl, coenzyme, m, reductase, mcr, wetlands, are, the, largest, natural, sources, of, methane, to, the, atmosphere, accounting, for, approximately, 20, 30, of, atmospheric, methane, climate, change, is, increasing, the, amount, of, methane, released, from, wetlands, due, to, increased, temperatures, and, altered, rainfall, patterns, this, phenomeon, is, called, wetland, methane, feedback, rice, cultivation, generates, as, much, as, 12, of, total, global, methane, emissions, due, to, the, long, term, flooding, of, rice, fields, ruminants, such, as, cattle, belch, methane, accounting, for, about, 22, of, the, u, s, annual, methane, emissions, to, the, atmosphere, one, study, reported, that, the, livestock, sector, in, general, primarily, cattle, chickens, and, pigs, produces, 37, of, all, human, induced, methane, a, 2013, study, estimated, that, livestock, accounted, for, 44, of, human, induced, methane, and, about, 15, of, human, induced, greenhouse, gas, emissions, many, efforts, are, underway, to, reduce, livestock, methane, production, such, as, medical, treatments, and, dietary, adjustments, and, to, trap, the, gas, to, use, its, combustion, energy, most, of, the, subseafloor, is, anoxic, because, oxygen, is, removed, by, aerobic, microorganisms, within, the, first, few, centimeters, of, the, sediment, below, the, oxygen, replete, seafloor, methanogens, produce, methane, that, is, either, used, by, other, organisms, or, becomes, trapped, in, gas, hydrates, these, other, organisms, that, utilize, methane, for, energy, are, known, as, methanotrophs, methane, eating, and, are, the, main, reason, why, little, methane, generated, at, depth, reaches, the, sea, surface, consortia, of, archaea, and, bacteria, have, been, found, to, oxidize, methane, via, anaerobic, oxidation, of, methane, aom, the, organisms, responsible, for, this, are, anaerobic, methanotrophic, archaea, anme, and, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, srb, given, its, cheap, abundance, in, natural, gas, there, is, little, incentive, to, produce, methane, industrially, methane, can, be, produced, by, hydrogenating, carbon, dioxide, through, the, sabatier, process, methane, is, also, a, side, product, of, the, hydrogenation, of, carbon, monoxide, in, the, fischer, tropsch, process, which, is, practiced, on, a, large, scale, to, produce, longer, chain, molecules, than, methane, an, example, of, large, scale, coal, to, methane, gasification, is, the, great, plains, synfuels, plant, started, in, 1984, in, beulah, north, dakota, as, a, way, to, develop, abundant, local, resources, of, low, grade, lignite, a, resource, that, is, otherwise, difficult, to, transport, for, its, weight, ash, content, low, calorific, value, and, propensity, to, spontaneous, combustion, during, storage, and, transport, a, number, of, similar, plants, exist, around, the, world, although, mostly, these, plants, are, targeted, towards, the, production, of, long, chain, alkanes, for, use, as, gasoline, diesel, or, feedstock, to, other, processes, power, to, methane, is, a, technology, that, uses, electrical, power, to, produce, hydrogen, from, water, by, electrolysis, and, uses, the, sabatier, reaction, to, combine, hydrogen, with, carbon, dioxide, to, produce, methane, methane, can, be, produced, by, protonation, of, methyl, lithium, or, a, methyl, grignard, reagent, such, as, methylmagnesium, chloride, it, can, also, be, made, from, anhydrous, sodium, acetate, and, dry, sodium, hydroxide, mixed, and, heated, above, 300, c, with, sodium, carbonate, as, byproduct, in, practice, a, requirement, for, pure, methane, can, easily, be, fulfilled, by, steel, gas, bottle, from, standard, gas, suppliers, methane, was, discovered, and, isolated, by, alessandro, volta, between, 1776, and, 1778, when, studying, marsh, gas, from, lake, maggiore, it, is, the, major, component, of, natural, gas, about, 87, by, volume, the, major, source, of, methane, is, extraction, from, geological, deposits, known, as, natural, gas, fields, with, coal, seam, gas, extraction, becoming, a, major, source, see, coal, bed, methane, extraction, a, method, for, extracting, methane, from, a, coal, deposit, while, enhanced, coal, bed, methane, recovery, is, a, method, of, recovering, methane, from, non, mineable, coal, seams, it, is, associated, with, other, hydrocarbon, fuels, and, sometimes, accompanied, by, helium, and, nitrogen, methane, is, produced, at, shallow, levels, low, pressure, by, anaerobic, decay, of, organic, matter, and, reworked, methane, from, deep, under, the, earth, s, surface, in, general, the, sediments, that, generate, natural, gas, are, buried, deeper, and, at, higher, temperatures, than, those, that, contain, oil, methane, is, generally, transported, in, bulk, by, pipeline, in, its, natural, gas, form, or, by, lng, carriers, in, its, liquefied, form, few, countries, transport, it, by, truck, methane, is, an, important, greenhouse, gas, responsible, for, around, 30, of, the, rise, in, global, temperatures, since, the, industrial, revolution, methane, has, a, global, warming, potential, gwp, of, 29, 8, 11, compared, to, co, 2, potential, of, 1, over, a, 100, year, period, and, 82, 5, 25, 8, over, a, 20, year, period, this, means, that, for, example, a, leak, of, one, tonne, of, methane, is, equivalent, to, emitting, 82, 5, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, burning, methane, and, producing, carbon, dioxide, also, reduces, the, greenhouse, gas, impact, compared, to, simply, venting, methane, to, the, atmosphere, as, methane, is, gradually, converted, into, carbon, dioxide, and, water, in, the, atmosphere, these, values, include, the, climate, forcing, from, the, carbon, dioxide, produced, from, methane, over, these, timescales, annual, global, methane, emissions, are, currently, approximately, 580, mt, 40, of, which, is, from, natural, sources, and, the, remaining, 60, originating, from, human, activity, known, as, anthropogenic, emissions, the, largest, anthropogenic, source, is, agriculture, responsible, for, around, one, quarter, of, emissions, closely, followed, by, the, energy, sector, which, includes, emissions, from, coal, oil, natural, gas, and, biofuels, historic, methane, concentrations, in, the, world, s, atmosphere, have, ranged, between, 300, and, 400, nmol, mol, during, glacial, periods, commonly, known, as, ice, ages, and, between, 600, and, 700, nmol, mol, during, the, warm, interglacial, periods, a, 2012, nasa, website, said, the, oceans, were, a, potential, important, source, of, arctic, methane, but, more, recent, studies, associate, increasing, methane, levels, as, caused, by, human, activity, global, monitoring, of, atmospheric, methane, concentrations, began, in, the, 1980s, the, earth, s, atmospheric, methane, concentration, has, increased, 160, since, preindustrial, levels, in, the, mid, 18th, century, in, 2013, atmospheric, methane, accounted, for, 20, of, the, total, radiative, forcing, from, all, of, the, long, lived, and, globally, mixed, greenhouse, gases, between, 2011, and, 2019, the, annual, average, increase, of, methane, in, the, atmosphere, was, 1866, ppb, from, 2015, to, 2019, sharp, rises, in, levels, of, atmospheric, methane, were, recorded, in, 2019, the, atmospheric, methane, concentration, was, higher, than, at, any, time, in, the, last, 800, 000, years, as, stated, in, the, ar6, of, the, ipcc, since, 1750, increases, in, co, 2, 47, and, ch, 4, 156, concentrations, far, exceed, and, increases, in, n, 2, o, 23, are, similar, to, the, natural, multi, millennial, changes, between, glacial, and, interglacial, periods, over, at, least, the, past, 800, 000, years, very, high, confidence, in, february, 2020, it, was, reported, that, fugitive, emissions, and, gas, venting, from, the, fossil, fuel, industry, may, have, been, significantly, underestimated, the, largest, annual, increase, occurred, in, 2021, with, the, overwhelming, percentage, caused, by, human, activity, climate, change, can, increase, atmospheric, methane, levels, by, increasing, methane, production, in, natural, ecosystems, forming, a, climate, change, feedback, another, explanation, for, the, rise, in, methane, emissions, could, be, a, slowdown, of, the, chemical, reaction, that, removes, methane, from, the, atmosphere, over, 100, countries, have, signed, the, global, methane, pledge, launched, in, 2021, promising, to, cut, their, methane, emissions, by, 30, by, 2030, this, could, avoid, 0, 2, c, of, warming, globally, by, 2050, although, there, have, been, calls, for, higher, commitments, in, order, to, reach, this, target, the, international, energy, agency, s, 2022, report, states, the, most, cost, effective, opportunities, for, methane, abatement, are, in, the, energy, sector, especially, in, oil, and, gas, operations, methane, clathrates, also, known, as, methane, hydrates, are, solid, cages, of, water, molecules, that, trap, single, molecules, of, methane, significant, reservoirs, of, methane, clathrates, have, been, found, in, arctic, permafrost, and, along, continental, margins, beneath, the, ocean, floor, within, the, gas, clathrate, stability, zone, located, at, high, pressures, 1, to, 100, mpa, lower, end, requires, lower, temperature, and, low, temperatures, 15, c, upper, end, requires, higher, pressure, methane, clathrates, can, form, from, biogenic, methane, thermogenic, methane, or, a, mix, of, the, two, these, deposits, are, both, a, potential, source, of, methane, fuel, as, well, as, a, potential, contributor, to, global, warming, the, global, mass, of, carbon, stored, in, gas, clathrates, is, still, uncertain, and, has, been, estimated, as, high, as, 12, 500, gt, carbon, and, as, low, as, 500, gt, carbon, the, estimate, has, declined, over, time, with, a, most, recent, estimate, of, 1800, gt, carbon, a, large, part, of, this, uncertainty, is, due, to, our, knowledge, gap, in, sources, and, sinks, of, methane, and, the, distribution, of, methane, clathrates, at, the, global, scale, for, example, a, source, of, methane, was, discovered, relatively, recently, in, an, ultraslow, spreading, ridge, in, the, arctic, some, climate, models, suggest, that, today, s, methane, emission, regime, from, the, ocean, floor, is, potentially, similar, to, that, during, the, period, of, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, petm, around, 55, 5, million, years, ago, although, there, are, no, data, indicating, that, methane, from, clathrate, dissociation, currently, reaches, the, atmosphere, arctic, methane, release, from, permafrost, and, seafloor, methane, clathrates, is, a, potential, consequence, and, further, cause, of, global, warming, this, is, known, as, the, clathrate, gun, hypothesis, data, from, 2016, indicate, that, arctic, permafrost, thaws, faster, than, predicted, methane, degrades, air, quality, and, adversely, impacts, human, health, agricultural, yields, and, ecosystem, productivity, methane, is, extremely, flammable, and, may, form, explosive, mixtures, with, air, methane, gas, explosions, are, responsible, for, many, deadly, mining, disasters, a, methane, gas, explosion, was, the, cause, of, the, upper, big, branch, coal, mine, disaster, in, west, virginia, on, april, 5, 2010, killing, 29, natural, gas, accidental, release, has, also, been, a, major, focus, in, the, field, of, safety, engineering, due, to, past, accidental, releases, that, concluded, in, the, formation, of, jet, fire, disasters, the, 2015, 2016, methane, gas, leak, in, aliso, canyon, california, was, considered, to, be, the, worst, in, terms, of, its, environmental, effect, in, american, history, it, was, also, described, as, more, damaging, to, the, environment, than, deepwater, horizon, s, leak, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, may, 2023, the, guardian, published, a, report, blaming, turkmenistan, to, be, the, worst, in, the, world, for, methane, super, emitting, the, data, collected, by, kayrros, researchers, indicate, that, two, large, turkmen, fossil, fuel, fields, leaked, 2, 6, million, and, 1, 8, million, metric, tonnes, of, methane, in, 2022, alone, pumping, the, co, 2, equivalent, of, 366, million, tonnes, into, the, atmosphere, surpassing, the, annual, co, 2, emissions, of, the, united, kingdom, methane, is, also, an, asphyxiant, if, the, oxygen, concentration, is, reduced, to, below, about, 16, by, displacement, as, most, people, can, tolerate, a, reduction, from, 21, to, 16, without, ill, effects, the, concentration, of, methane, at, which, asphyxiation, risk, becomes, significant, is, much, higher, than, the, 5, 15, concentration, in, a, flammable, or, explosive, mixture, methane, off, gas, can, penetrate, the, interiors, of, buildings, near, landfills, and, expose, occupants, to, significant, levels, of, methane, some, buildings, have, specially, engineered, recovery, systems, below, their, basements, to, actively, capture, this, gas, and, vent, it, away, from, the, building, methane, is, abundant, in, many, parts, of, the, solar, system, and, potentially, could, be, harvested, on, the, surface, of, another, solar, system, body, in, particular, using, methane, production, from, local, materials, found, on, mars, or, titan, providing, fuel, for, a, return, journey, methane, has, been, detected, on, all, planets, of, the, solar, system, and, most, of, the, larger, moons, with, the, possible, exception, of, mars, it, is, believed, to, have, come, from, abiotic, processes, the, curiosity, rover, has, documented, seasonal, fluctuations, of, atmospheric, methane, levels, on, mars, these, fluctuations, peaked, at, the, end, of, the, martian, summer, at, 0, 6, parts, per, billion, methane, has, been, proposed, as, a, possible, rocket, propellant, on, future, mars, missions, due, in, part, to, the, possibility, of, synthesizing, it, on, the, planet, by, in, situ, resource, utilization, an, adaptation, of, the, sabatier, methanation, reaction, may, be, used, with, a, mixed, catalyst, bed, and, a, reverse, water, gas, shift, in, a, single, reactor, to, produce, methane, and, oxygen, from, the, raw, materials, available, on, mars, utilizing, water, from, the, martian, subsoil, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, martian, atmosphere, methane, could, be, produced, by, a, non, biological, process, called, serpentinization, involving, water, carbon, dioxide, and, the, mineral, olivine, which, is, known, to, be, common, on, mars, methane, has, been, detected, in, vast, abundance, on, titan, the, largest, moon, of, saturn, it, comprises, a, significant, portion, of, its, atmosphere, and, also, exists, in, a, liquid, form, on, its, surface, where, it, comprises, the, majority, of, the, liquid, in, titan, s, vast, lakes, of, hydrocarbons, the, second, largest, of, which, is, believed, to, be, almost, pure, methane, in, composition, the, presence, of, stable, lakes, of, liquid, methane, on, titan, as, well, as, the, surface, of, titan, being, highly, chemically, active, and, rich, in, organic, compounds, has, led, scientists, to, consider, the, possibility, of, life, existing, within, titan, s, lakes, using, methane, as, a, solvent, in, the, place, of, water, for, earth, based, life, and, using, hydrogen, in, the, atmosphere, to, derive, energy, with, acetylene, in, much, the, same, way, that, earth, based, life, uses, glucose, methane, was, first, scientifically, identified, in, november, 1776, by, italian, physicist, alessandro, volta, in, the, marshes, of, lake, maggiore, straddling, italy, and, switzerland, volta, was, inspired, to, search, for, the, substance, after, reading, a, paper, written, by, benjamin, franklin, about, flammable, air, volta, collected, the, gas, rising, from, the, marsh, and, by, 1778, had, isolated, pure, methane, he, also, demonstrated, that, the, gas, could, be, ignited, with, an, electric, spark, following, the, felling, mine, disaster, of, 1812, in, which, 92, men, perished, sir, humphry, davy, established, that, the, feared, firedamp, was, in, fact, largely, methane, the, name, methane, was, coined, in, 1866, by, the, german, chemist, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, the, name, was, derived, from, methanol, etymologically, the, word, methane, is, coined, from, the, chemical, suffix, ane, which, denotes, substances, belonging, to, the, alkane, family, and, the, word, methyl, which, is, derived, from, the, german, methyl, 1840, or, directly, from, the, french, m, thyle, which, is, a, back, formation, from, the, french, m, thyl, ne, corresponding, to, english, methylene, the, root, of, which, was, coined, by, jean, baptiste, dumas, and, eug, ne, p, ligot, in, 1834, from, the, greek, methy, wine, related, to, english, mead, and, hyle, meaning, wood, the, radical, is, named, after, this, because, it, was, first, detected, in, methanol, an, alcohol, first, isolated, by, distillation, of, wood, the, chemical, suffix, ane, is, from, the, coordinating, chemical, suffix, ine, which, is, from, latin, feminine, suffix, ina, which, is, applied, to, represent, abstracts, the, coordination, of, ane, ene, one, etc, was, proposed, in, 1866, by, german, chemist, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, the, abbreviation, ch, 4, c, can, mean, the, mass, of, carbon, contained, in, a, mass, of, methane, and, the, mass, of, methane, is, always, 1, 33, times, the, mass, of, ch, 4, c, ch, 4, c, can, also, mean, the, methane, carbon, ratio, which, is, 1, 33, by, mass, methane, at, scales, of, the, atmosphere, is, commonly, measured, in, teragrams, tg, ch, 4, or, millions, of, metric, tons, mmt, ch, 4, which, mean, the, same, thing, other, standard, units, are, also, used, such, as, nanomole, nmol, one, billionth, of, a, mole, mole, mol, kilogram, and, gram
