ganymede, or, jupiter, iii, is, the, largest, and, most, massive, natural, satellite, of, jupiter, and, in, the, solar, system, it, is, the, largest, solar, system, object, without, a, substantial, atmosphere, despite, being, the, only, moon, in, the, solar, system, with, a, substantial, magnetic, field, like, titan, saturn, s, largest, moon, it, is, larger, than, the, planet, mercury, but, has, somewhat, less, surface, gravity, than, mercury, io, or, the, moon, due, to, its, lower, density, compared, to, the, three, ganymede, is, composed, of, silicate, rock, and, water, in, approximately, equal, proportions, it, is, a, fully, differentiated, body, with, an, iron, rich, liquid, core, and, an, internal, ocean, that, potentially, contains, more, water, than, all, of, earth, s, oceans, combined, its, surface, is, composed, of, two, main, types, of, terrain, the, first, of, the, two, main, surface, types, are, the, lighter, regions, which, are, generally, crosscut, by, extensive, grooves, and, ridges, dating, from, slightly, less, than, 4, billion, years, ago, they, cover, about, two, thirds, of, ganymede, the, cause, of, the, light, terrain, s, disrupted, geology, is, not, fully, known, but, it, is, speculated, that, this, may, be, the, result, of, tectonic, activity, due, to, tidal, heating, next, are, the, dark, regions, that, cover, about, a, third, of, ganymede, these, dark, regions, are, saturated, with, impact, craters, and, are, dated, to, four, billion, years, ago, ganymede, orbits, jupiter, in, roughly, seven, days, and, is, in, a, 1, 2, 4, orbital, resonance, with, the, moons, europa, and, io, respectively, possessing, a, metallic, core, it, has, the, lowest, moment, of, inertia, factor, of, any, solid, body, in, the, solar, system, ganymede, s, magnetic, field, is, probably, created, by, convection, within, its, liquid, iron, core, also, created, by, jupiter, s, tidal, forces, the, meager, magnetic, field, is, buried, within, jupiter, s, far, larger, magnetic, field, and, would, show, only, as, a, local, perturbation, of, the, field, lines, ganymede, has, a, thin, oxygen, atmosphere, that, includes, o, o, 2, and, possibly, o, 3, ozone, atomic, hydrogen, is, a, minor, atmospheric, constituent, whether, ganymede, has, an, ionosphere, associated, with, its, atmosphere, is, unresolved, ganymede, s, discovery, is, credited, to, simon, marius, and, galileo, galilei, who, both, observed, it, in, 1610, as, the, third, of, the, galilean, moons, the, first, group, of, objects, discovered, orbiting, another, planet, its, name, was, soon, suggested, by, astronomer, simon, marius, after, the, mythological, ganymede, a, trojan, prince, desired, by, zeus, the, greek, counterpart, of, jupiter, who, carried, him, off, to, be, the, cupbearer, of, the, gods, beginning, with, pioneer, 10, several, spacecraft, have, explored, ganymede, the, voyager, probes, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, refined, measurements, of, its, size, while, galileo, discovered, its, underground, ocean, and, magnetic, field, the, next, planned, mission, to, the, jovian, system, is, the, european, space, agency, s, jupiter, icy, moon, explorer, juice, which, was, launched, in, 2023, after, flybys, of, all, three, icy, galilean, moons, it, is, planned, to, enter, orbit, around, ganymede, chinese, astronomical, records, report, that, in, 365, bc, gan, de, detected, what, might, have, been, a, moon, of, jupiter, probably, ganymede, with, the, naked, eye, however, gan, de, reported, the, color, of, the, companion, as, reddish, which, is, puzzling, since, moons, are, too, faint, for, their, color, to, be, perceived, with, the, naked, eye, shi, shen, and, gan, de, together, made, fairly, accurate, observations, of, the, five, major, planets, on, january, 7, 1610, galileo, galilei, used, a, telescope, to, observe, what, he, thought, were, three, stars, near, jupiter, including, what, turned, out, to, be, ganymede, callisto, and, one, body, that, turned, out, to, be, the, combined, light, from, io, and, europa, the, next, night, he, noticed, that, they, had, moved, on, january, 13, he, saw, all, four, at, once, for, the, first, time, but, had, seen, each, of, the, moons, before, this, date, at, least, once, by, january, 15, galileo, concluded, that, the, stars, were, actually, bodies, orbiting, jupiter, galileo, claimed, the, right, to, name, the, moons, he, had, discovered, he, considered, cosmian, stars, and, settled, on, medicean, stars, in, honor, of, cosimo, ii, de, medici, the, french, astronomer, nicolas, claude, fabri, de, peiresc, suggested, individual, names, from, the, medici, family, for, the, moons, but, his, proposal, was, not, taken, up, simon, marius, who, had, originally, claimed, to, have, found, the, galilean, satellites, tried, to, name, the, moons, the, saturn, of, jupiter, the, jupiter, of, jupiter, this, was, ganymede, the, venus, of, jupiter, and, the, mercury, of, jupiter, another, nomenclature, that, never, caught, on, later, on, after, finding, out, about, a, suggestion, from, johannes, kepler, marius, agreed, with, kepler, s, proposal, and, so, he, then, proposed, a, naming, system, based, on, greek, mythology, instead, this, final, kepler, marius, proposal, was, ultimately, successful, jupiter, is, much, blamed, by, the, poets, on, account, of, his, irregular, loves, three, maidens, are, especially, mentioned, as, having, been, clandestinely, courted, by, jupiter, with, success, io, daughter, of, the, river, inachus, callisto, of, lycaon, europa, of, agenor, then, there, was, ganymede, the, handsome, son, of, king, tros, whom, jupiter, having, taken, the, form, of, an, eagle, transported, to, heaven, on, his, back, as, poets, fabulously, tell, i, think, therefore, that, i, shall, not, have, done, amiss, if, the, first, is, called, by, me, io, the, second, europa, the, third, on, account, of, its, majesty, of, light, ganymede, the, fourth, callisto, this, name, and, those, of, the, other, galilean, satellites, fell, into, disfavor, for, a, considerable, time, and, were, not, in, common, use, until, the, mid, 20th, century, in, much, of, the, earlier, astronomical, literature, ganymede, is, referred, to, instead, by, its, roman, numeral, designation, jupiter, iii, a, system, introduced, by, galileo, in, other, words, the, third, satellite, of, jupiter, following, the, discovery, of, moons, of, saturn, a, naming, system, based, on, that, of, kepler, and, marius, was, used, for, jupiter, s, moons, ganymede, is, the, only, galilean, moon, of, jupiter, named, after, a, male, figure, like, io, europa, and, callisto, he, was, a, lover, of, zeus, in, english, the, galilean, satellites, io, europa, and, callisto, have, the, latin, spellings, of, their, names, but, the, latin, form, of, ganymede, is, ganym, d, s, which, would, be, pronounced, n, m, i, d, i, z, however, the, final, syllable, is, dropped, in, english, perhaps, under, the, influence, of, french, ganym, de, ganymede, orbits, jupiter, at, a, distance, of, 1, 070, 400, kilometres, 665, 100, mi, third, among, the, galilean, satellites, and, completes, a, revolution, every, seven, days, and, three, hours, 7, 155, days, like, most, known, moons, ganymede, is, tidally, locked, with, one, side, always, facing, toward, the, planet, hence, its, day, is, also, seven, days, and, three, hours, its, orbit, is, very, slightly, eccentric, and, inclined, to, the, jovian, equator, with, the, eccentricity, and, inclination, changing, quasi, periodically, due, to, solar, and, planetary, gravitational, perturbations, on, a, timescale, of, centuries, the, ranges, of, change, are, 0, 0009, 0, 0022, and, 0, 05, 0, 32, respectively, these, orbital, variations, cause, the, axial, tilt, the, angle, between, the, rotational, and, orbital, axes, to, vary, between, 0, and, 0, 33, ganymede, participates, in, orbital, resonances, with, europa, and, io, for, every, orbit, of, ganymede, europa, orbits, twice, and, io, orbits, four, times, conjunctions, alignment, on, the, same, side, of, jupiter, between, io, and, europa, occur, when, io, is, at, periapsis, and, europa, at, apoapsis, conjunctions, between, europa, and, ganymede, occur, when, europa, is, at, periapsis, the, longitudes, of, the, io, europa, and, europa, ganymede, conjunctions, change, at, the, same, rate, making, triple, conjunctions, impossible, such, a, complicated, resonance, is, called, the, laplace, resonance, the, current, laplace, resonance, is, unable, to, pump, the, orbital, eccentricity, of, ganymede, to, a, higher, value, the, value, of, about, 0, 0013, is, probably, a, remnant, from, a, previous, epoch, when, such, pumping, was, possible, the, ganymedian, orbital, eccentricity, is, somewhat, puzzling, if, it, is, not, pumped, now, it, should, have, decayed, long, ago, due, to, the, tidal, dissipation, in, the, interior, of, ganymede, this, means, that, the, last, episode, of, the, eccentricity, excitation, happened, only, several, hundred, million, years, ago, because, ganymede, s, orbital, eccentricity, is, relatively, low, on, average, 0, 0015, tidal, heating, is, negligible, now, however, in, the, past, ganymede, may, have, passed, through, one, or, more, laplace, like, resonances, that, were, able, to, pump, the, orbital, eccentricity, to, a, value, as, high, as, 0, 01, 0, 02, this, probably, caused, a, significant, tidal, heating, of, the, interior, of, ganymede, the, formation, of, the, grooved, terrain, may, be, a, result, of, one, or, more, heating, episodes, there, are, two, hypotheses, for, the, origin, of, the, laplace, resonance, among, io, europa, and, ganymede, that, it, is, primordial, and, has, existed, from, the, beginning, of, the, solar, system, or, that, it, developed, after, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, a, possible, sequence, of, events, for, the, latter, scenario, is, as, follows, io, raised, tides, on, jupiter, causing, io, s, orbit, to, expand, due, to, conservation, of, momentum, until, it, encountered, the, 2, 1, resonance, with, europa, after, that, the, expansion, continued, but, some, of, the, angular, moment, was, transferred, to, europa, as, the, resonance, caused, its, orbit, to, expand, as, well, the, process, continued, until, europa, encountered, the, 2, 1, resonance, with, ganymede, eventually, the, drift, rates, of, conjunctions, between, all, three, moons, were, synchronized, and, locked, in, the, laplace, resonance, with, a, diameter, of, about, 5, 270, kilometres, 3, 270, mi, and, a, mass, of, 1, 48, 10, 20, tonnes, 1, 48, 10, 23, kg, 3, 26, 10, 23, lb, ganymede, is, the, largest, and, most, massive, moon, in, the, solar, system, it, is, slightly, more, massive, than, the, second, most, massive, moon, saturn, s, satellite, titan, and, is, more, than, twice, as, massive, as, the, earth, s, moon, it, is, larger, than, the, planet, mercury, which, has, a, diameter, of, 4, 880, kilometres, 3, 030, mi, but, is, only, 45, percent, of, mercury, s, mass, ganymede, is, the, ninth, largest, object, in, the, solar, system, but, the, tenth, most, massive, the, average, density, of, ganymede, 1, 936, g, cm, 3, a, bit, greater, than, callisto, s, suggests, a, composition, of, about, equal, parts, rocky, material, and, mostly, water, ices, some, of, the, water, is, liquid, forming, an, underground, ocean, the, mass, fraction, of, ices, is, between, 46, and, 50, percent, which, is, slightly, lower, than, that, in, callisto, some, additional, volatile, ices, such, as, ammonia, may, also, be, present, the, exact, composition, of, ganymede, s, rock, is, not, known, but, is, probably, close, to, the, composition, of, l, ll, type, ordinary, chondrites, which, are, characterized, by, less, total, iron, less, metallic, iron, and, more, iron, oxide, than, h, chondrites, the, weight, ratio, of, iron, to, silicon, ranges, between, 1, 05, and, 1, 27, in, ganymede, whereas, the, solar, ratio, is, around, 1, 8, ganymede, s, surface, has, an, albedo, of, about, 43, percent, water, ice, seems, to, be, ubiquitous, on, its, surface, with, a, mass, fraction, of, 50, 90, percent, significantly, more, than, in, ganymede, as, a, whole, near, infrared, spectroscopy, has, revealed, the, presence, of, strong, water, ice, absorption, bands, at, wavelengths, of, 1, 04, 1, 25, 1, 5, 2, 0, and, 3, 0, m, the, grooved, terrain, is, brighter, and, has, a, more, icy, composition, than, the, dark, terrain, the, analysis, of, high, resolution, near, infrared, and, uv, spectra, obtained, by, the, galileo, spacecraft, and, from, earth, observations, has, revealed, various, non, water, materials, carbon, dioxide, sulfur, dioxide, and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen, sulfate, and, various, organic, compounds, galileo, results, have, also, shown, magnesium, sulfate, mgso, 4, and, possibly, sodium, sulfate, na, 2, so, 4, on, ganymede, s, surface, these, salts, may, originate, from, the, subsurface, ocean, the, ganymedian, surface, albedo, is, very, asymmetric, the, leading, hemisphere, is, brighter, than, the, trailing, one, this, is, similar, to, europa, but, the, reverse, for, callisto, the, trailing, hemisphere, of, ganymede, appears, to, be, enriched, in, sulfur, dioxide, the, distribution, of, carbon, dioxide, does, not, demonstrate, any, hemispheric, asymmetry, but, little, or, no, carbon, dioxide, is, observed, near, the, poles, impact, craters, on, ganymede, except, one, do, not, show, any, enrichment, in, carbon, dioxide, which, also, distinguishes, it, from, callisto, ganymede, s, carbon, dioxide, gas, was, probably, depleted, in, the, past, ganymede, s, surface, is, a, mix, of, two, types, of, terrain, very, old, highly, cratered, dark, regions, and, somewhat, younger, but, still, ancient, lighter, regions, marked, with, an, extensive, array, of, grooves, and, ridges, the, dark, terrain, which, comprises, about, one, third, of, the, surface, contains, clays, and, organic, materials, that, could, indicate, the, composition, of, the, impactors, from, which, jovian, satellites, accreted, the, heating, mechanism, required, for, the, formation, of, the, grooved, terrain, on, ganymede, is, an, unsolved, problem, in, the, planetary, sciences, the, modern, view, is, that, the, grooved, terrain, is, mainly, tectonic, in, nature, cryovolcanism, is, thought, to, have, played, only, a, minor, role, if, any, the, forces, that, caused, the, strong, stresses, in, the, ganymedian, ice, lithosphere, necessary, to, initiate, the, tectonic, activity, may, be, connected, to, the, tidal, heating, events, in, the, past, possibly, caused, when, the, satellite, passed, through, unstable, orbital, resonances, the, tidal, flexing, of, the, ice, may, have, heated, the, interior, and, strained, the, lithosphere, leading, to, the, development, of, cracks, and, horst, and, graben, faulting, which, erased, the, old, dark, terrain, on, 70, percent, of, the, surface, the, formation, of, the, grooved, terrain, may, also, be, connected, with, the, early, core, formation, and, subsequent, tidal, heating, of, ganymede, s, interior, which, may, have, caused, a, slight, expansion, of, ganymede, by, one, to, six, percent, due, to, phase, transitions, in, ice, and, thermal, expansion, during, subsequent, evolution, deep, hot, water, plumes, may, have, risen, from, the, core, to, the, surface, leading, to, the, tectonic, deformation, of, the, lithosphere, radiogenic, heating, within, the, satellite, is, the, most, relevant, current, heat, source, contributing, for, instance, to, ocean, depth, research, models, have, found, that, if, the, orbital, eccentricity, were, an, order, of, magnitude, greater, than, currently, as, it, may, have, been, in, the, past, tidal, heating, would, be, a, more, substantial, heat, source, than, radiogenic, heating, cratering, is, seen, on, both, types, of, terrain, but, is, especially, extensive, on, the, dark, terrain, it, appears, to, be, saturated, with, impact, craters, and, has, evolved, largely, through, impact, events, the, brighter, grooved, terrain, contains, many, fewer, impact, features, which, have, been, only, of, minor, importance, to, its, tectonic, evolution, the, density, of, cratering, indicates, an, age, of, 4, billion, years, for, the, dark, terrain, similar, to, the, highlands, of, the, moon, and, a, somewhat, younger, age, for, the, grooved, terrain, but, how, much, younger, is, uncertain, ganymede, may, have, experienced, a, period, of, heavy, cratering, 3, 5, to, 4, billion, years, ago, similar, to, that, of, the, moon, if, true, the, vast, majority, of, impacts, happened, in, that, epoch, whereas, the, cratering, rate, has, been, much, smaller, since, craters, both, overlay, and, are, crosscut, by, the, groove, systems, indicating, that, some, of, the, grooves, are, quite, ancient, relatively, young, craters, with, rays, of, ejecta, are, also, visible, ganymedian, craters, are, flatter, than, those, on, the, moon, and, mercury, this, is, probably, due, to, the, relatively, weak, nature, of, ganymede, s, icy, crust, which, can, or, could, flow, and, thereby, soften, the, relief, ancient, craters, whose, relief, has, disappeared, leave, only, a, ghost, of, a, crater, known, as, a, palimpsest, one, significant, feature, on, ganymede, is, a, dark, plain, named, galileo, regio, which, contains, a, series, of, concentric, grooves, or, furrows, likely, created, during, a, period, of, geologic, activity, ganymede, also, has, polar, caps, likely, composed, of, water, frost, the, frost, extends, to, 40, latitude, these, polar, caps, were, first, seen, by, the, voyager, spacecraft, theories, on, the, formation, of, the, caps, include, the, migration, of, water, to, higher, latitudes, and, the, bombardment, of, the, ice, by, plasma, data, from, galileo, suggests, the, latter, is, correct, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, on, ganymede, results, in, more, intense, charged, particle, bombardment, of, its, surface, in, the, unprotected, polar, regions, sputtering, then, leads, to, redistribution, of, water, molecules, with, frost, migrating, to, locally, colder, areas, within, the, polar, terrain, a, crater, named, anat, provides, the, reference, point, for, measuring, longitude, on, ganymede, by, definition, anat, is, at, 128, longitude, the, 0, longitude, directly, faces, jupiter, and, unless, stated, otherwise, longitude, increases, toward, the, west, ganymede, appears, to, be, fully, differentiated, with, an, internal, structure, consisting, of, an, iron, sulfide, iron, core, a, silicate, mantle, and, outer, layers, of, water, ice, and, liquid, water, the, precise, thicknesses, of, the, different, layers, in, the, interior, of, ganymede, depend, on, the, assumed, composition, of, silicates, fraction, of, olivine, and, pyroxene, and, amount, of, sulfur, in, the, core, ganymede, has, the, lowest, moment, of, inertia, factor, 0, 31, among, the, solid, solar, system, bodies, this, is, a, consequence, of, its, substantial, water, content, and, fully, differentiated, interior, in, the, 1970s, nasa, scientists, first, suspected, that, ganymede, had, a, thick, ocean, between, two, layers, of, ice, one, on, the, surface, and, one, beneath, a, liquid, ocean, and, atop, the, rocky, mantle, in, the, 1990s, nasa, s, galileo, mission, flew, by, ganymede, and, found, indications, of, such, a, subsurface, ocean, an, analysis, published, in, 2014, taking, into, account, the, realistic, thermodynamics, for, water, and, effects, of, salt, suggests, that, ganymede, might, have, a, stack, of, several, ocean, layers, separated, by, different, phases, of, ice, with, the, lowest, liquid, layer, adjacent, to, the, rocky, mantle, water, rock, contact, may, be, an, important, factor, in, the, origin, of, life, the, analysis, also, notes, that, the, extreme, depths, involved, 800, km, to, the, rocky, seafloor, mean, that, temperatures, at, the, bottom, of, a, convective, adiabatic, ocean, can, be, up, to, 40, k, higher, than, those, at, the, ice, water, interface, in, march, 2015, scientists, reported, that, measurements, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, of, how, the, aurorae, moved, confirmed, that, ganymede, has, a, subsurface, ocean, a, large, saltwater, ocean, affects, ganymede, s, magnetic, field, and, consequently, its, aurorae, the, evidence, suggests, that, ganymede, s, oceans, might, be, the, largest, in, the, entire, solar, system, these, observations, were, later, supported, by, juno, which, detected, various, salts, and, other, compounds, on, ganymede, s, surface, including, hydrated, sodium, chloride, ammonium, chloride, sodium, bicarbonate, and, possibly, aliphatic, aldehydes, these, compounds, were, potentially, deposited, from, ganymede, s, ocean, in, past, resurfacing, events, and, were, discovered, to, be, most, abundant, in, ganymede, s, lower, latitudes, shielded, by, its, small, magnetosphere, as, a, result, of, these, findings, there, is, increasing, speculation, on, the, potential, habitability, of, ganymede, s, ocean, the, existence, of, a, liquid, iron, nickel, rich, core, provides, a, natural, explanation, for, the, intrinsic, magnetic, field, of, ganymede, detected, by, galileo, spacecraft, the, convection, in, the, liquid, iron, which, has, high, electrical, conductivity, is, the, most, reasonable, model, of, magnetic, field, generation, the, density, of, the, core, is, 5, 5, 6, g, cm, 3, and, the, silicate, mantle, is, 3, 4, 3, 6, g, cm, 3, the, radius, of, this, core, may, be, up, to, 500, km, the, temperature, in, the, core, of, ganymede, is, probably, 1500, 1700, k, and, pressure, up, to, 10, gpa, 99, 000, atm, in, 1972, a, team, of, indian, british, and, american, astronomers, working, in, java, indonesia, and, kavalur, india, claimed, that, they, had, detected, a, thin, atmosphere, during, an, occultation, when, it, and, jupiter, passed, in, front, of, a, star, they, estimated, that, the, surface, pressure, was, around, 0, 1, pa, 1, microbar, however, in, 1979, voyager, 1, observed, an, occultation, of, the, star, centauri, during, its, flyby, of, jupiter, with, differing, results, the, occultation, measurements, were, conducted, in, the, far, ultraviolet, spectrum, at, wavelengths, shorter, than, 200, nm, which, were, much, more, sensitive, to, the, presence, of, gases, than, the, 1972, measurements, made, in, the, visible, spectrum, no, atmosphere, was, revealed, by, the, voyager, data, the, upper, limit, on, the, surface, particle, number, density, was, found, to, be, 1, 5, 10, 9, cm, 3, which, corresponds, to, a, surface, pressure, of, less, than, 2, 5, pa, 25, picobar, the, latter, value, is, almost, five, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, the, 1972, estimate, despite, the, voyager, data, evidence, for, a, tenuous, oxygen, atmosphere, exosphere, on, ganymede, very, similar, to, the, one, found, on, europa, was, found, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, hst, in, 1995, hst, actually, observed, airglow, of, atomic, oxygen, in, the, far, ultraviolet, at, the, wavelengths, 130, 4, nm, and, 135, 6, nm, such, an, airglow, is, excited, when, molecular, oxygen, is, dissociated, by, electron, impacts, which, is, evidence, of, a, significant, neutral, atmosphere, composed, predominantly, of, o, 2, molecules, the, surface, number, density, probably, lies, in, the, 1, 2, 7, 10, 8, cm, 3, range, corresponding, to, the, surface, pressure, of, 0, 2, 1, 2, pa, these, values, are, in, agreement, with, voyager, s, upper, limit, set, in, 1981, the, oxygen, is, not, evidence, of, life, it, is, thought, to, be, produced, when, water, ice, on, ganymede, s, surface, is, split, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, by, radiation, with, the, hydrogen, then, being, more, rapidly, lost, due, to, its, low, atomic, mass, the, airglow, observed, over, ganymede, is, not, spatially, homogeneous, like, that, observed, over, europa, hst, observed, two, bright, spots, located, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, near, 50, latitude, which, is, exactly, the, boundary, between, the, open, and, closed, field, lines, of, the, ganymedian, magnetosphere, see, below, the, bright, spots, are, probably, polar, auroras, caused, by, plasma, precipitation, along, the, open, field, lines, the, existence, of, a, neutral, atmosphere, implies, that, an, ionosphere, should, exist, because, oxygen, molecules, are, ionized, by, the, impacts, of, the, energetic, electrons, coming, from, the, magnetosphere, and, by, solar, euv, radiation, however, the, nature, of, the, ganymedian, ionosphere, is, as, controversial, as, the, nature, of, the, atmosphere, some, galileo, measurements, found, an, elevated, electron, density, near, ganymede, suggesting, an, ionosphere, whereas, others, failed, to, detect, anything, the, electron, density, near, the, surface, is, estimated, by, different, sources, to, lie, in, the, range, 400, 2, 500, cm, 3, as, of, 2008, the, parameters, of, the, ionosphere, of, ganymede, were, not, well, constrained, additional, evidence, of, the, oxygen, atmosphere, comes, from, spectral, detection, of, gases, trapped, in, the, ice, at, the, surface, of, ganymede, the, detection, of, ozone, o, 3, bands, was, announced, in, 1996, in, 1997, spectroscopic, analysis, revealed, the, dimer, or, diatomic, absorption, features, of, molecular, oxygen, such, an, absorption, can, arise, only, if, the, oxygen, is, in, a, dense, phase, the, best, candidate, is, molecular, oxygen, trapped, in, ice, the, depth, of, the, dimer, absorption, bands, depends, on, latitude, and, longitude, rather, than, on, surface, albedo, they, tend, to, decrease, with, increasing, latitude, on, ganymede, whereas, o, 3, shows, an, opposite, trend, laboratory, work, has, found, that, o, 2, would, not, cluster, or, bubble, but, would, dissolve, in, ice, at, ganymede, s, relatively, warm, surface, temperature, of, 100, k, 173, 15, c, a, search, for, sodium, in, the, atmosphere, just, after, such, a, finding, on, europa, turned, up, nothing, in, 1997, sodium, is, at, least, 13, times, less, abundant, around, ganymede, than, around, europa, possibly, because, of, a, relative, deficiency, at, the, surface, or, because, the, magnetosphere, fends, off, energetic, particles, another, minor, constituent, of, the, ganymedian, atmosphere, is, atomic, hydrogen, hydrogen, atoms, were, observed, as, far, as, 3, 000, km, from, ganymede, s, surface, their, density, on, the, surface, is, about, 1, 5, 10, 4, cm, 3, in, 2021, water, vapour, was, detected, in, the, atmosphere, of, ganymede, the, galileo, craft, made, six, close, flybys, of, ganymede, from, 1995, to, 2000, g1, g2, g7, g8, g28, and, g29, and, discovered, that, ganymede, has, a, permanent, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, independent, of, the, jovian, magnetic, field, the, value, of, the, moment, is, about, 1, 3, 10, 13, t, m, 3, which, is, three, times, larger, than, the, magnetic, moment, of, mercury, the, magnetic, dipole, is, tilted, with, respect, to, the, rotational, axis, of, ganymede, by, 176, which, means, that, it, is, directed, against, the, jovian, magnetic, moment, its, north, pole, lies, below, the, orbital, plane, the, dipole, magnetic, field, created, by, this, permanent, moment, has, a, strength, of, 719, 2, nt, at, ganymede, s, equator, which, should, be, compared, with, the, jovian, magnetic, field, at, the, distance, of, ganymede, about, 120, nt, the, equatorial, field, of, ganymede, is, directed, against, the, jovian, field, meaning, reconnection, is, possible, the, intrinsic, field, strength, at, the, poles, is, two, times, that, at, the, equator, 1440, nt, the, permanent, magnetic, moment, carves, a, part, of, space, around, ganymede, creating, a, tiny, magnetosphere, embedded, inside, that, of, jupiter, it, is, the, only, moon, in, the, solar, system, known, to, possess, the, feature, its, diameter, is, 4, 5, ganymede, radii, the, ganymedian, magnetosphere, has, a, region, of, closed, field, lines, located, below, 30, latitude, where, charged, particles, electrons, and, ions, are, trapped, creating, a, kind, of, radiation, belt, the, main, ion, species, in, the, magnetosphere, is, single, ionized, oxygen, o, which, fits, well, with, ganymede, s, tenuous, oxygen, atmosphere, in, the, polar, cap, regions, at, latitudes, higher, than, 30, magnetic, field, lines, are, open, connecting, ganymede, with, jupiter, s, ionosphere, in, these, areas, the, energetic, tens, and, hundreds, of, kiloelectronvolt, electrons, and, ions, have, been, detected, which, may, cause, the, auroras, observed, around, the, ganymedian, poles, in, addition, heavy, ions, precipitate, continuously, on, ganymede, s, polar, surface, sputtering, and, darkening, the, ice, the, interaction, between, the, ganymedian, magnetosphere, and, jovian, plasma, is, in, many, respects, similar, to, that, of, the, solar, wind, and, earth, s, magnetosphere, the, plasma, co, rotating, with, jupiter, impinges, on, the, trailing, side, of, the, ganymedian, magnetosphere, much, like, the, solar, wind, impinges, on, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, the, main, difference, is, the, speed, of, plasma, flow, supersonic, in, the, case, of, earth, and, subsonic, in, the, case, of, ganymede, because, of, the, subsonic, flow, there, is, no, bow, shock, off, the, trailing, hemisphere, of, ganymede, in, addition, to, the, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, ganymede, has, an, induced, dipole, magnetic, field, its, existence, is, connected, with, the, variation, of, the, jovian, magnetic, field, near, ganymede, the, induced, moment, is, directed, radially, to, or, from, jupiter, following, the, direction, of, the, varying, part, of, the, planetary, magnetic, field, the, induced, magnetic, moment, is, an, order, of, magnitude, weaker, than, the, intrinsic, one, the, field, strength, of, the, induced, field, at, the, magnetic, equator, is, about, 60, nt, half, of, that, of, the, ambient, jovian, field, the, induced, magnetic, field, of, ganymede, is, similar, to, those, of, callisto, and, europa, indicating, that, ganymede, also, has, a, subsurface, water, ocean, with, a, high, electrical, conductivity, given, that, ganymede, is, completely, differentiated, and, has, a, metallic, core, its, intrinsic, magnetic, field, is, probably, generated, in, a, similar, fashion, to, the, earth, s, as, a, result, of, conducting, material, moving, in, the, interior, the, magnetic, field, detected, around, ganymede, is, likely, to, be, caused, by, compositional, convection, in, the, core, if, the, magnetic, field, is, the, product, of, dynamo, action, or, magnetoconvection, despite, the, presence, of, an, iron, core, ganymede, s, magnetosphere, remains, enigmatic, particularly, given, that, similar, bodies, lack, the, feature, some, research, has, suggested, that, given, its, relatively, small, size, the, core, ought, to, have, sufficiently, cooled, to, the, point, where, fluid, motions, hence, a, magnetic, field, would, not, be, sustained, one, explanation, is, that, the, same, orbital, resonances, proposed, to, have, disrupted, the, surface, also, allowed, the, magnetic, field, to, persist, with, ganymede, s, eccentricity, pumped, and, tidal, heating, of, the, mantle, increased, during, such, resonances, reducing, heat, flow, from, the, core, leaving, it, fluid, and, convective, another, explanation, is, a, remnant, magnetization, of, silicate, rocks, in, the, mantle, which, is, possible, if, the, satellite, had, a, more, significant, dynamo, generated, field, in, the, past, the, radiation, level, at, the, surface, of, ganymede, is, considerably, lower, than, on, europa, being, 50, 80, msv, 5, 8, rem, per, day, an, amount, that, would, cause, severe, illness, or, death, in, human, beings, exposed, for, two, months, ganymede, probably, formed, by, an, accretion, in, jupiter, s, subnebula, a, disk, of, gas, and, dust, surrounding, jupiter, after, its, formation, the, accretion, of, ganymede, probably, took, about, 10, 000, years, much, shorter, than, the, 100, 000, years, estimated, for, callisto, the, jovian, subnebula, may, have, been, relatively, gas, starved, when, the, galilean, satellites, formed, this, would, have, allowed, for, the, lengthy, accretion, times, required, for, callisto, in, contrast, ganymede, formed, closer, to, jupiter, where, the, subnebula, was, denser, which, explains, its, shorter, formation, timescale, this, relatively, fast, formation, prevented, the, escape, of, accretional, heat, which, may, have, led, to, ice, melt, and, differentiation, the, separation, of, the, rocks, and, ice, the, rocks, settled, to, the, center, forming, the, core, in, this, respect, ganymede, is, different, from, callisto, which, apparently, failed, to, melt, and, differentiate, early, due, to, loss, of, the, accretional, heat, during, its, slower, formation, this, hypothesis, explains, why, the, two, jovian, moons, look, so, dissimilar, despite, their, similar, mass, and, composition, alternative, theories, explain, ganymede, s, greater, internal, heating, on, the, basis, of, tidal, flexing, or, more, intense, pummeling, by, impactors, during, the, late, heavy, bombardment, in, the, latter, case, modeling, suggests, that, differentiation, would, become, a, runaway, process, at, ganymede, but, not, callisto, after, formation, ganymede, s, core, largely, retained, the, heat, accumulated, during, accretion, and, differentiation, only, slowly, releasing, it, to, the, ice, mantle, the, mantle, in, turn, transported, it, to, the, surface, by, convection, the, decay, of, radioactive, elements, within, rocks, further, heated, the, core, causing, increased, differentiation, an, inner, iron, iron, sulfide, core, and, a, silicate, mantle, formed, with, this, ganymede, became, a, fully, differentiated, body, by, comparison, the, radioactive, heating, of, undifferentiated, callisto, caused, convection, in, its, icy, interior, which, effectively, cooled, it, and, prevented, large, scale, melting, of, ice, and, rapid, differentiation, the, convective, motions, in, callisto, have, caused, only, a, partial, separation, of, rock, and, ice, today, ganymede, continues, to, cool, slowly, the, heat, being, released, from, its, core, and, silicate, mantle, enables, the, subsurface, ocean, to, exist, whereas, the, slow, cooling, of, the, liquid, fe, fes, core, causes, convection, and, supports, magnetic, field, generation, the, current, heat, flux, out, of, ganymede, is, probably, higher, than, that, out, of, callisto, a, study, from, 2020, by, hirata, suetsugu, and, ohtsuki, suggests, that, ganymede, probably, was, hit, by, a, massive, asteroid, 4, billion, years, ago, an, impact, so, violent, that, may, have, shifted, the, moon, s, axis, the, study, came, to, this, conclusion, analyzing, images, of, the, furrows, system, in, the, satelite, s, surface, several, spacecraft, have, performed, close, flybys, of, ganymede, two, pioneer, and, two, voyager, spacecraft, made, a, single, flyby, each, between, 1973, and, 1979, the, galileo, spacecraft, made, six, passes, between, 1996, and, 2000, and, the, juno, spacecraft, performed, two, flybys, in, 2019, and, 2021, no, spacecraft, has, yet, orbited, ganymede, but, the, juice, mission, which, launched, in, april, 2023, intends, to, do, so, the, first, spacecraft, to, approach, close, to, ganymede, was, pioneer, 10, which, performed, a, flyby, in, 1973, as, it, passed, through, the, jupiter, system, at, high, speed, pioneer, 11, made, a, similar, flyby, in, 1974, data, sent, back, by, the, two, spacecraft, was, used, to, determine, the, moon, s, physical, characteristics, and, provided, images, of, the, surface, with, up, to, 400, km, 250, mi, resolution, pioneer, 10, s, closest, approach, was, 446, 250, km, about, 85, times, ganymede, s, diameter, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, both, studied, ganymede, when, passing, through, the, jupiter, system, in, 1979, data, from, those, flybys, were, used, to, refine, the, size, of, ganymede, revealing, it, was, larger, than, saturn, s, moon, titan, which, was, previously, thought, to, have, been, bigger, images, from, the, voyagers, provided, the, first, views, of, the, moon, s, grooved, surface, terrain, the, pioneer, and, voyager, flybys, were, all, at, large, distances, and, high, speeds, as, they, flew, on, unbound, trajectories, through, the, jupiter, system, better, data, can, be, obtained, from, a, spacecraft, which, is, orbiting, jupiter, as, it, can, encounter, ganymede, at, a, lower, speed, and, adjust, the, orbit, for, a, closer, approach, in, 1995, the, galileo, spacecraft, entered, orbit, around, jupiter, and, between, 1996, and, 2000, made, six, close, flybys, of, ganymede, these, flybys, were, denoted, g1, g2, g7, g8, g28, and, g29, during, the, closest, flyby, g2, galileo, passed, just, 264, km, from, the, surface, of, ganymede, five, percent, of, the, moon, s, diameter, which, remains, the, closest, approach, by, any, spacecraft, during, the, g1, flyby, in, 1996, galileo, instruments, detected, ganymede, s, magnetic, field, data, from, the, galileo, flybys, was, used, to, discover, the, sub, surface, ocean, which, was, announced, in, 2001, high, spatial, resolution, spectra, of, ganymede, taken, by, galileo, were, used, to, identify, several, non, ice, compounds, on, the, surface, the, new, horizons, spacecraft, also, observed, ganymede, but, from, a, much, larger, distance, as, it, passed, through, the, jupiter, system, in, 2007, en, route, to, pluto, the, data, were, used, to, perform, topographic, and, compositional, mapping, of, ganymede, like, galileo, the, juno, spacecraft, orbited, jupiter, on, 2019, december, 25, juno, performed, a, distant, flyby, of, ganymede, during, its, 24th, orbit, of, jupiter, at, a, range, of, 97, 680, to, 109, 439, kilometers, 60, 696, to, 68, 002, mi, this, flyby, provided, images, of, the, moon, s, polar, regions, in, june, 2021, juno, performed, a, second, flyby, at, a, closer, distance, of, 1, 038, kilometers, 645, mi, this, encounter, was, designed, to, provide, a, gravity, assist, to, reduce, juno, s, orbital, period, from, 53, days, to, 43, days, additional, images, of, the, surface, were, collected, the, jupiter, icy, moons, explorer, juice, will, be, the, first, to, enter, orbit, around, ganymede, itself, juice, was, launched, on, april, 14, 2023, it, is, intended, to, perform, its, first, flyby, of, ganymede, in, 2031, then, enter, orbit, of, the, moon, in, 2032, when, the, spacecraft, consumes, its, propellant, juice, is, planned, to, be, deorbited, and, impact, ganymede, in, february, 2034, in, addition, to, juice, nasa, s, europa, clipper, which, is, scheduled, to, launch, in, october, 2024, will, conduct, 4, close, flybys, of, ganymede, beginning, in, 2030, it, may, also, crash, into, ganymede, at, the, end, of, its, mission, to, aid, juice, in, studying, the, surface, s, geochemistry, several, other, missions, have, been, proposed, to, flyby, or, orbit, ganymede, but, were, either, not, selected, for, funding, or, cancelled, before, launch, the, jupiter, icy, moons, orbiter, would, have, studied, ganymede, in, greater, detail, however, the, mission, was, canceled, in, 2005, another, old, proposal, was, called, the, grandeur, of, ganymede, a, ganymede, orbiter, based, on, the, juno, probe, was, proposed, in, 2010, for, the, planetary, science, decadal, survey, the, mission, was, not, supported, with, the, decadal, survey, preferring, the, europa, clipper, mission, instead, the, europa, jupiter, system, mission, had, a, proposed, launch, date, of, 2020, and, was, a, joint, nasa, and, esa, proposal, for, exploration, of, many, of, jupiter, s, moons, including, ganymede, in, february, 2009, it, was, announced, that, esa, and, nasa, had, given, this, mission, priority, ahead, of, the, titan, saturn, system, mission, the, mission, was, to, consist, of, the, nasa, led, jupiter, europa, orbiter, the, esa, led, jupiter, ganymede, orbiter, and, possibly, a, jaxa, led, jupiter, magnetospheric, orbiter, the, nasa, and, jaxa, components, were, later, cancelled, and, esa, s, appeared, likely, to, be, cancelled, too, but, in, 2012, esa, announced, it, would, go, ahead, alone, the, european, part, of, the, mission, became, the, jupiter, icy, moon, explorer, juice, the, russian, space, research, institute, proposed, a, ganymede, lander, astrobiology, mission, called, laplace, p, possibly, in, partnership, with, juice, if, selected, it, would, have, been, launched, in, 2023, the, mission, was, cancelled, due, to, a, lack, of, funding, in, 2017
