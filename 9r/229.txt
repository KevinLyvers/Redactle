hubble, s, law, also, known, as, the, hubble, lema, tre, law, is, the, observation, in, physical, cosmology, that, galaxies, are, moving, away, from, earth, at, speeds, proportional, to, their, distance, in, other, words, the, farther, they, are, the, faster, they, are, moving, away, from, earth, the, velocity, of, the, galaxies, has, been, determined, by, their, redshift, a, shift, of, the, light, they, emit, toward, the, red, end, of, the, visible, light, spectrum, the, discovery, of, hubble, s, law, is, attributed, to, edwin, hubble, s, work, published, in, 1929, hubble, s, law, is, considered, the, first, observational, basis, for, the, expansion, of, the, universe, and, today, it, serves, as, one, of, the, pieces, of, evidence, most, often, cited, in, support, of, the, big, bang, model, the, motion, of, astronomical, objects, due, solely, to, this, expansion, is, known, as, the, hubble, flow, it, is, described, by, the, equation, v, h, 0, d, with, h, 0, the, constant, of, proportionality, the, hubble, constant, between, the, proper, distance, d, to, a, galaxy, which, can, change, over, time, unlike, the, comoving, distance, and, its, speed, of, separation, v, i, e, the, derivative, of, proper, distance, with, respect, to, the, cosmic, time, coordinate, see, comoving, and, proper, distances, uses, of, the, proper, distance, for, discussion, of, the, subtleties, of, this, definition, of, velocity, the, hubble, constant, is, most, frequently, quoted, in, km, s, mpc, thus, giving, the, speed, in, km, s, of, a, galaxy, 1, megaparsec, 3, 09, 10, 19, km, away, and, its, value, is, about, 70, km, s, mpc, however, crossing, out, units, reveals, that, h, 0, is, a, unit, of, frequency, si, unit, s, 1, and, the, reciprocal, of, h, 0, is, known, as, the, hubble, time, the, hubble, constant, can, also, be, interpreted, as, the, relative, rate, of, expansion, in, this, form, h, 0, 7, gyr, meaning, that, at, the, current, rate, of, expansion, it, takes, a, billion, years, for, an, unbound, structure, to, grow, by, 7, although, widely, attributed, to, edwin, hubble, the, notion, of, the, universe, expanding, at, a, calculable, rate, was, first, derived, from, general, relativity, equations, in, 1922, by, alexander, friedmann, friedmann, published, a, set, of, equations, now, known, as, the, friedmann, equations, showing, that, the, universe, might, be, expanding, and, presenting, the, expansion, speed, if, that, were, the, case, before, hubble, german, astronomer, carl, wilhelm, wirtz, had, in, two, publications, dating, 1922, and, 1924, already, deduced, with, his, own, data, that, galaxies, that, appeared, smaller, and, dimmer, had, larger, redshifts, and, thus, that, more, distant, galaxies, recede, faster, from, the, observer, then, georges, lema, tre, in, a, 1927, article, independently, derived, that, the, universe, might, be, expanding, observed, the, proportionality, between, recessional, velocity, of, and, distance, to, distant, bodies, and, suggested, an, estimated, value, for, the, proportionality, constant, this, constant, when, edwin, hubble, confirmed, the, existence, of, cosmic, expansion, and, determined, a, more, accurate, value, for, it, two, years, later, came, to, be, known, by, his, name, as, the, hubble, constant, hubble, inferred, the, recession, velocity, of, the, objects, from, their, redshifts, many, of, which, were, earlier, measured, and, related, to, velocity, by, vesto, slipher, in, 1917, combining, slipher, s, velocities, with, henrietta, swan, leavitt, s, intergalactic, distance, calculations, and, methodology, allowed, hubble, to, better, calculate, an, expansion, rate, for, the, universe, though, the, hubble, constant, h, 0, is, constant, at, any, given, moment, in, time, the, hubble, parameter, h, of, which, the, hubble, constant, is, the, current, value, varies, with, time, so, the, term, constant, is, sometimes, thought, of, as, somewhat, of, a, misnomer, a, decade, before, hubble, made, his, observations, a, number, of, physicists, and, mathematicians, had, established, a, consistent, theory, of, an, expanding, universe, by, using, einstein, field, equations, of, general, relativity, applying, the, most, general, principles, to, the, nature, of, the, universe, yielded, a, dynamic, solution, that, conflicted, with, the, then, prevalent, notion, of, a, static, universe, in, 1912, vesto, m, slipher, measured, the, first, doppler, shift, of, a, spiral, nebula, the, obsolete, term, for, spiral, galaxies, and, soon, discovered, that, almost, all, such, nebulae, were, receding, from, earth, he, did, not, grasp, the, cosmological, implications, of, this, fact, and, indeed, at, the, time, it, was, highly, controversial, whether, or, not, these, nebulae, were, island, universes, outside, the, milky, way, galaxy, in, 1922, alexander, friedmann, derived, his, friedmann, equations, from, einstein, field, equations, showing, that, the, universe, might, expand, at, a, rate, calculable, by, the, equations, the, parameter, used, by, friedmann, is, known, today, as, the, scale, factor, and, can, be, considered, as, a, scale, invariant, form, of, the, proportionality, constant, of, hubble, s, law, georges, lema, tre, independently, found, a, similar, solution, in, his, 1927, paper, discussed, in, the, following, section, the, friedmann, equations, are, derived, by, inserting, the, metric, for, a, homogeneous, and, isotropic, universe, into, einstein, s, field, equations, for, a, fluid, with, a, given, density, and, pressure, this, idea, of, an, expanding, spacetime, would, eventually, lead, to, the, big, bang, and, steady, state, theories, of, cosmology, in, 1927, two, years, before, hubble, published, his, own, article, the, belgian, priest, and, astronomer, georges, lema, tre, was, the, first, to, publish, research, deriving, what, is, now, known, as, hubble, s, law, according, to, the, canadian, astronomer, sidney, van, den, bergh, the, 1927, discovery, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, by, lema, tre, was, published, in, french, in, a, low, impact, journal, in, the, 1931, high, impact, english, translation, of, this, article, a, critical, equation, was, changed, by, omitting, reference, to, what, is, now, known, as, the, hubble, constant, it, is, now, known, that, the, alterations, in, the, translated, paper, were, carried, out, by, lema, tre, himself, before, the, advent, of, modern, cosmology, there, was, considerable, talk, about, the, size, and, shape, of, the, universe, in, 1920, the, shapley, curtis, debate, took, place, between, harlow, shapley, and, heber, d, curtis, over, this, issue, shapley, argued, for, a, small, universe, the, size, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, curtis, argued, that, the, universe, was, much, larger, the, issue, was, resolved, in, the, coming, decade, with, hubble, s, improved, observations, edwin, hubble, did, most, of, his, professional, astronomical, observing, work, at, mount, wilson, observatory, home, to, the, world, s, most, powerful, telescope, at, the, time, his, observations, of, cepheid, variable, stars, in, spiral, nebulae, enabled, him, to, calculate, the, distances, to, these, objects, surprisingly, these, objects, were, discovered, to, be, at, distances, which, placed, them, well, outside, the, milky, way, they, continued, to, be, called, nebulae, and, it, was, only, gradually, that, the, term, galaxies, replaced, it, the, parameters, that, appear, in, hubble, s, law, velocities, and, distances, are, not, directly, measured, in, reality, we, determine, say, a, supernova, brightness, which, provides, information, about, its, distance, and, the, redshift, z, of, its, spectrum, of, radiation, hubble, correlated, brightness, and, parameter, z, combining, his, measurements, of, galaxy, distances, with, vesto, slipher, and, milton, humason, s, measurements, of, the, redshifts, associated, with, the, galaxies, hubble, discovered, a, rough, proportionality, between, redshift, of, an, object, and, its, distance, though, there, was, considerable, scatter, now, known, to, be, caused, by, peculiar, velocities, the, hubble, flow, is, used, to, refer, to, the, region, of, space, far, enough, out, that, the, recession, velocity, is, larger, than, local, peculiar, velocities, hubble, was, able, to, plot, a, trend, line, from, the, 46, galaxies, he, studied, and, obtain, a, value, for, the, hubble, constant, of, 500, km, s, mpc, much, higher, than, the, currently, accepted, value, due, to, errors, in, his, distance, calibrations, see, cosmic, distance, ladder, for, details, hubble, s, law, can, be, easily, depicted, in, a, hubble, diagram, in, which, the, velocity, assumed, approximately, proportional, to, the, redshift, of, an, object, is, plotted, with, respect, to, its, distance, from, the, observer, a, straight, line, of, positive, slope, on, this, diagram, is, the, visual, depiction, of, hubble, s, law, after, hubble, s, discovery, was, published, albert, einstein, abandoned, his, work, on, the, cosmological, constant, which, he, had, designed, to, modify, his, equations, of, general, relativity, to, allow, them, to, produce, a, static, solution, which, he, thought, was, the, correct, state, of, the, universe, the, einstein, equations, in, their, simplest, form, model, either, an, expanding, or, contracting, universe, so, einstein, s, cosmological, constant, was, artificially, created, to, counter, the, expansion, or, contraction, to, get, a, perfect, static, and, flat, universe, after, hubble, s, discovery, that, the, universe, was, in, fact, expanding, einstein, called, his, faulty, assumption, that, the, universe, is, static, his, biggest, mistake, on, its, own, general, relativity, could, predict, the, expansion, of, the, universe, which, through, observations, such, as, the, bending, of, light, by, large, masses, or, the, precession, of, the, orbit, of, mercury, could, be, experimentally, observed, and, compared, to, his, theoretical, calculations, using, particular, solutions, of, the, equations, he, had, originally, formulated, in, 1931, einstein, went, to, mount, wilson, observatory, to, thank, hubble, for, providing, the, observational, basis, for, modern, cosmology, the, cosmological, constant, has, regained, attention, in, recent, decades, as, a, hypothetical, explanation, for, dark, energy, the, discovery, of, the, linear, relationship, between, redshift, and, distance, coupled, with, a, supposed, linear, relation, between, recessional, velocity, and, redshift, yields, a, straightforward, mathematical, expression, for, hubble, s, law, as, follows, v, h, 0, d, displaystyle, v, h, 0, d, where, hubble, s, law, is, considered, a, fundamental, relation, between, recessional, velocity, and, distance, however, the, relation, between, recessional, velocity, and, redshift, depends, on, the, cosmological, model, adopted, and, is, not, established, except, for, small, redshifts, for, distances, d, larger, than, the, radius, of, the, hubble, sphere, r, hs, objects, recede, at, a, rate, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, see, uses, of, the, proper, distance, for, a, discussion, of, the, significance, of, this, r, hs, c, h, 0, displaystyle, r, text, hs, frac, c, h, 0, since, the, hubble, constant, is, a, constant, only, in, space, not, in, time, the, radius, of, the, hubble, sphere, may, increase, or, decrease, over, various, time, intervals, the, subscript, 0, indicates, the, value, of, the, hubble, constant, today, current, evidence, suggests, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, see, accelerating, universe, meaning, that, for, any, given, galaxy, the, recession, velocity, dd, dt, is, increasing, over, time, as, the, galaxy, moves, to, greater, and, greater, distances, however, the, hubble, parameter, is, actually, thought, to, be, decreasing, with, time, meaning, that, if, we, were, to, look, at, some, fixed, distance, d, and, watch, a, series, of, different, galaxies, pass, that, distance, later, galaxies, would, pass, that, distance, at, a, smaller, velocity, than, earlier, ones, redshift, can, be, measured, by, determining, the, wavelength, of, a, known, transition, such, as, hydrogen, lines, for, distant, quasars, and, finding, the, fractional, shift, compared, to, a, stationary, reference, thus, redshift, is, a, quantity, unambiguous, for, experimental, observation, the, relation, of, redshift, to, recessional, velocity, is, another, matter, the, redshift, z, is, often, described, as, a, redshift, velocity, which, is, the, recessional, velocity, that, would, produce, the, same, redshift, if, it, were, caused, by, a, linear, doppler, effect, which, however, is, not, the, case, as, the, shift, is, caused, in, part, by, a, cosmological, expansion, of, space, and, because, the, velocities, involved, are, too, large, to, use, a, non, relativistic, formula, for, doppler, shift, this, redshift, velocity, can, easily, exceed, the, speed, of, light, in, other, words, to, determine, the, redshift, velocity, v, rs, the, relation, v, rs, c, z, displaystyle, v, text, rs, equiv, cz, is, used, that, is, there, is, no, fundamental, difference, between, redshift, velocity, and, redshift, they, are, rigidly, proportional, and, not, related, by, any, theoretical, reasoning, the, motivation, behind, the, redshift, velocity, terminology, is, that, the, redshift, velocity, agrees, with, the, velocity, from, a, low, velocity, simplification,

frac, v, c, here, o, e, are, the, observed, and, emitted, wavelengths, respectively, the, redshift, velocity, v, rs, is, not, so, simply, related, to, real, velocity, at, larger, velocities, however, and, this, terminology, leads, to, confusion, if, interpreted, as, a, real, velocity, next, the, connection, between, redshift, or, redshift, velocity, and, recessional, velocity, is, discussed, suppose, r, t, is, called, the, scale, factor, of, the, universe, and, increases, as, the, universe, expands, in, a, manner, that, depends, upon, the, cosmological, model, selected, its, meaning, is, that, all, measured, proper, distances, d, t, between, co, moving, points, increase, proportionally, to, r, the, co, moving, points, are, not, moving, relative, to, each, other, except, as, a, result, of, the, expansion, of, space, in, other, words, d, t, d, t, 0, r, t, r, t, 0, displaystyle, frac, d, t, d, t, 0, frac, r, t, r, t, 0, where, t, 0, is, some, reference, time, if, light, is, emitted, from, a, galaxy, at, time, t, e, and, received, by, us, at, t, 0, it, is, redshifted, due, to, the, expansion, of, space, and, this, redshift, z, is, simply, z, r, t, 0, r, t, e, 1, displaystyle, z,

v, r, v, r, d, t, d, d, t, r, r, d, displaystyle, v, text, r, d, t, d, frac, d, t, r, r, d, we, now, define, the, hubble, constant, as, h, d, t, r, r, displaystyle, h, equiv, frac, d, t, r, r, and, discover, the, hubble, law, v, r, h, d, displaystyle, v, text, r, hd, from, this, perspective, hubble, s, law, is, a, fundamental, relation, between, i, the, recessional, velocity, contributed, by, the, expansion, of, space, and, ii, the, distance, to, an, object, the, connection, between, redshift, and, distance, is, a, crutch, used, to, connect, hubble, s, law, with, observations, this, law, can, be, related, to, redshift, z, approximately, by, making, a, taylor, series, expansion, z, r, t, 0, r, t, e, 1, r, t, 0, r, t, 0, 1, t, e, t, 0, h, t, 0, 1, t, 0, t, e, h, t, 0, displaystyle, z,

the, model, become, small, corrections, and, the, time, interval, is, simply, the, distance, divided, by, the, speed, of, light, z, t, 0, t, e, h, t, 0, d, c, h, t, 0, displaystyle, z, approx, t, 0,

valid, at, low, redshifts, to, be, replaced, by, a, relation, at, large, redshifts, that, is, model, dependent, see, velocity, redshift, figure, strictly, speaking, neither, v, nor, d, in, the, formula, are, directly, observable, because, they, are, properties, now, of, a, galaxy, whereas, our, observations, refer, to, the, galaxy, in, the, past, at, the, time, that, the, light, we, currently, see, left, it, for, relatively, nearby, galaxies, redshift, z, much, less, than, one, v, and, d, will, not, have, changed, much, and, v, can, be, estimated, using, the, formula, v, zc, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, this, gives, the, empirical, relation, found, by, hubble, for, distant, galaxies, v, or, d, cannot, be, calculated, from, z, without, specifying, a, detailed, model, for, how, h, changes, with, time, the, redshift, is, not, even, directly, related, to, the, recession, velocity, at, the, time, the, light, set, out, but, it, does, have, a, simple, interpretation, 1, z, is, the, factor, by, which, the, universe, has, expanded, while, the, photon, was, traveling, towards, the, observer, in, using, hubble, s, law, to, determine, distances, only, the, velocity, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, can, be, used, since, gravitationally, interacting, galaxies, move, relative, to, each, other, independent, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, these, relative, velocities, called, peculiar, velocities, need, to, be, accounted, for, in, the, application, of, hubble, s, law, such, peculiar, velocities, give, rise, to, redshift, space, distortions, the, parameter, h, is, commonly, called, the, hubble, constant, but, that, is, a, misnomer, since, it, is, constant, in, space, only, at, a, fixed, time, it, varies, with, time, in, nearly, all, cosmological, models, and, all, observations, of, far, distant, objects, are, also, observations, into, the, distant, past, when, the, constant, had, a, different, value, hubble, parameter, is, a, more, correct, term, with, h, 0, denoting, the, present, day, value, another, common, source, of, confusion, is, that, the, accelerating, universe, does, not, imply, that, the, hubble, parameter, is, actually, increasing, with, time, since, h, t, a, t, a, t, displaystyle, h, t, equiv, dot, a, t, a, t, in, most, accelerating, models, a, displaystyle, a, increases, relatively, faster, than, a, displaystyle, dot, a, so, h, decreases, with, time, the, recession, velocity, of, one, chosen, galaxy, does, increase, but, different, galaxies, passing, a, sphere, of, fixed, radius, cross, the, sphere, more, slowly, at, later, times, on, defining, the, dimensionless, deceleration, parameter, q, a, a, a, 2, textstyle, q, equiv, frac, ddot, a, a, dot, a, 2, it, follows, that, d, h, d, t, h, 2, 1, q, displaystyle, frac, dh, dt, h, 2, 1, q, from, this, it, is, seen, that, the, hubble, parameter, is, decreasing, with, time, unless, q, 1, the, latter, can, only, occur, if, the, universe, contains, phantom, energy, regarded, as, theoretically, somewhat, improbable, however, in, the, standard, lambda, cold, dark, matter, model, lambda, cdm, or, cdm, model, q, will, tend, to, 1, from, above, in, the, distant, future, as, the, cosmological, constant, becomes, increasingly, dominant, over, matter, this, implies, that, h, will, approach, from, above, to, a, constant, value, of, 57, km, s, mpc, and, the, scale, factor, of, the, universe, will, then, grow, exponentially, in, time, the, mathematical, derivation, of, an, idealized, hubble, s, law, for, a, uniformly, expanding, universe, is, a, fairly, elementary, theorem, of, geometry, in, 3, dimensional, cartesian, newtonian, coordinate, space, which, considered, as, a, metric, space, is, entirely, homogeneous, and, isotropic, properties, do, not, vary, with, location, or, direction, simply, stated, the, theorem, is, this, any, two, points, which, are, moving, away, from, the, origin, each, along, straight, lines, and, with, speed, proportional, to, distance, from, the, origin, will, be, moving, away, from, each, other, with, a, speed, proportional, to, their, distance, apart, in, fact, this, applies, to, non, cartesian, spaces, as, long, as, they, are, locally, homogeneous, and, isotropic, specifically, to, the, negatively, and, positively, curved, spaces, frequently, considered, as, cosmological, models, see, shape, of, the, universe, an, observation, stemming, from, this, theorem, is, that, seeing, objects, recede, from, us, on, earth, is, not, an, indication, that, earth, is, near, to, a, center, from, which, the, expansion, is, occurring, but, rather, that, every, observer, in, an, expanding, universe, will, see, objects, receding, from, them, the, value, of, the, hubble, parameter, changes, over, time, either, increasing, or, decreasing, depending, on, the, value, of, the, so, called, deceleration, parameter, q, which, is, defined, by, q, 1, h, h, 2, displaystyle, q, left, 1, frac, dot, h, h, 2, right, in, a, universe, with, a, deceleration, parameter, equal, to, zero, it, follows, that, h, 1, t, where, t, is, the, time, since, the, big, bang, a, non, zero, time, dependent, value, of, q, simply, requires, integration, of, the, friedmann, equations, backwards, from, the, present, time, to, the, time, when, the, comoving, horizon, size, was, zero, it, was, long, thought, that, q, was, positive, indicating, that, the, expansion, is, slowing, down, due, to, gravitational, attraction, this, would, imply, an, age, of, the, universe, less, than, 1, h, which, is, about, 14, billion, years, for, instance, a, value, for, q, of, 1, 2, once, favoured, by, most, theorists, would, give, the, age, of, the, universe, as, 2, 3, h, the, discovery, in, 1998, that, q, is, apparently, negative, means, that, the, universe, could, actually, be, older, than, 1, h, however, estimates, of, the, age, of, the, universe, are, very, close, to, 1, h, the, expansion, of, space, summarized, by, the, big, bang, interpretation, of, hubble, s, law, is, relevant, to, the, old, conundrum, known, as, olbers, paradox, if, the, universe, were, infinite, in, size, static, and, filled, with, a, uniform, distribution, of, stars, then, every, line, of, sight, in, the, sky, would, end, on, a, star, and, the, sky, would, be, as, bright, as, the, surface, of, a, star, however, the, night, sky, is, largely, dark, since, the, 17th, century, astronomers, and, other, thinkers, have, proposed, many, possible, ways, to, resolve, this, paradox, but, the, currently, accepted, resolution, depends, in, part, on, the, big, bang, theory, and, in, part, on, the, hubble, expansion, in, a, universe, that, existed, for, a, finite, amount, of, time, only, the, light, of, a, finite, number, of, stars, has, had, enough, time, to, reach, us, and, the, paradox, is, resolved, additionally, in, an, expanding, universe, distant, objects, recede, from, us, which, causes, the, light, emanated, from, them, to, be, redshifted, and, diminished, in, brightness, by, the, time, we, see, it, instead, of, working, with, hubble, s, constant, a, common, practice, is, to, introduce, the, dimensionless, hubble, constant, usually, denoted, by, h, and, commonly, referred, to, as, little, h, then, to, write, hubble, s, constant, h, 0, as, h, 100, km, s, 1, mpc, 1, all, the, relative, uncertainty, of, the, true, value, of, h, 0, being, then, relegated, to, h, the, dimensionless, hubble, constant, is, often, used, when, giving, distances, that, are, calculated, from, redshift, z, using, the, formula, d, c, h, 0, z, since, h, 0, is, not, precisely, known, the, distance, is, expressed, as, c, z, h, 0, 2998, z, mpc, h, 1, displaystyle, cz, h, 0, approx, 2998, times, z, text, mpc,

etc, as, explained, above, the, hubble, length, or, hubble, distance, is, a, unit, of, distance, in, cosmology, defined, as, ch, 1, the, speed, of, light, multiplied, by, the, hubble, time, it, is, equivalent, to, 4, 420, million, parsecs, or, 14, 4, billion, light, years, the, numerical, value, of, the, hubble, length, in, light, years, is, by, definition, equal, to, that, of, the, hubble, time, in, years, the, hubble, distance, would, be, the, distance, between, the, earth, and, the, galaxies, which, are, currently, receding, from, us, at, the, speed, of, light, as, can, be, seen, by, substituting, d, ch, 1, into, the, equation, for, hubble, s, law, v, h, 0, d, the, hubble, volume, is, sometimes, defined, as, a, volume, of, the, universe, with, a, comoving, size, of, ch, 1, the,

hubble, volume, to, refer, to, the, volume, of, the, observable, universe, although, this, has, a, radius, approximately, three, times, larger, the, value, of, the, hubble, constant, h, 0, tells, the,

has, been, actively, measured, using, various, methods, in, the, early, days, hubble, for, example, used, bright, stars, and, the, light, of, the, nebula, to, estimate, the, redshift, and, determined, the, constant, later, after, type, ia, supernova, was, found, to, be, a, better, standard, candle, of, distant, galaxies, supernova, were, used, to, determine, the, redshift, these, measurements, need, to, determine, the, distance, of, the, target, stars, or, galaxies, first, uncertainties, in, the, physical, assumptions, used, to, determine, these, distances, have, caused, varying, estimates, of, the, hubble, constant, more, recently, scientists, use, cmb, measurements, such, as, planck, s, data, to, determine, the, hubble, constant, the, challenge, of, using, this, method, is, that, its, result, varies, depending, on, the, cosmology, models, used, due, to, the, different, values, of, hubble, constant, estimated, using, different, techniques, the, determination, of, hubble, constant, is, an, active, research, field, hubble, tension, the, high, accuracy, measurement, using, james, webb, space, telescope, in, 2023, has, confirmed, the, earlier, observation, of, the, hubble, space, telescope, which, gave, a, hubble, constant, about, h, 0, 74, km, s, mpc, hubble, s, original, estimate, of, the, constant, now, bearing, his, name, based, on, observations, of, cepheid, variable, stars, as, standard, candles, to, measure, distance, was, 500, km, s, mpc, much, larger, than, the, value, astronomers, currently, calculate, later, observations, by, astronomer, walter, baade, led, him, to, realize, that, there, were, distinct, populations, for, stars, population, i, and, population, ii, in, a, galaxy, the, same, observations, led, him, to, discover, that, there, are, two, types, of, cepheid, variable, stars, with, different, luminosities, using, this, discovery, he, recalculated, hubble, constant, and, the, size, of, the, known, universe, doubling, the, previous, calculation, made, by, hubble, in, 1929, he, announced, this, finding, to, considerable, astonishment, at, the, 1952, meeting, of, the, international, astronomical, union, in, rome, for, most, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, value, of, h, 0, was, estimated, to, be, between, 50, and, 90, km, s, mpc, the, value, of, the, hubble, constant, was, the, topic, of, a, long, and, rather, bitter, controversy, between, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, who, claimed, the, value, was, around, 100, and, allan, sandage, who, claimed, the, value, was, near, 50, in, one, demonstration, of, vitriol, shared, between, the, parties, when, sandage, and, gustav, andreas, tammann, sandage, s, research, colleague, formally, acknowledged, the, shortcomings, of, confirming, the, systematic, error, of, their, method, in, 1975, vaucouleurs, responded, it, is, unfortunate, that, this, sober, warning, was, so, soon, forgotten, and, ignored, by, most, astronomers, and, textbook, writers, in, 1996, a, debate, moderated, by, john, bahcall, between, sidney, van, den, bergh, and, gustav, tammann, was, held, in, similar, fashion, to, the, earlier, shapley, curtis, debate, over, these, two, competing, values, this, previously, wide, variance, in, estimates, was, partially, resolved, with, the, introduction, of, the, cdm, model, of, the, universe, in, the, late, 1990s, incorporating, the, cdm, model, observations, of, high, redshift, clusters, at, x, ray, and, microwave, wavelengths, using, the, sunyaev, zel, dovich, effect, measurements, of, anisotropies, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, and, optical, surveys, all, gave, a, value, of, around, 50, 70, km, s, mpc, for, the, constant, in, the, 21st, century, multiple, methods, have, been, used, to, determine, the, hubble, constant, late, universe, measurements, using, calibrated, distance, ladder, techniques, have, converged, on, a, value, of, approximately, 73, km, s, mpc, since, 2000, early, universe, techniques, based, on, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, have, become, available, and, these, agree, on, a, value, near, 67, 7, km, s, mpc, this, is, accounting, for, the, change, in, the, expansion, rate, since, the, early, universe, so, is, comparable, to, the, first, number, initially, this, discrepancy, was, within, the, estimated, measurement, uncertainties, and, thus, no, cause, for, concern, however, as, techniques, have, improved, the, estimated, measurement, uncertainties, have, shrunk, but, the, discrepancies, have, not, to, the, point, that, the, disagreement, is, now, highly, statistically, significant, this, discrepancy, is, called, the, hubble, tension, the, cause, of, the, hubble, tension, is, unknown, and, there, are, many, possible, proposed, solutions, the, most, conservative, is, that, there, is, an, unknown, systematic, error, affecting, either, early, universe, or, late, universe, observations, although, intuitively, appealing, this, explanation, requires, multiple, unrelated, effects, regardless, of, whether, early, universe, or, late, universe, observations, are, incorrect, and, there, are, no, obvious, candidates, furthermore, any, such, systematic, error, would, need, to, affect, multiple, different, instruments, since, both, the, early, universe, and, late, universe, observations, come, from, several, different, telescopes, alternatively, it, could, be, that, the, observations, are, correct, but, some, unaccounted, for, effect, is, causing, the, discrepancy, if, the, cosmological, principle, fails, see, lambda, cdm, model, violations, of, the, cosmological, principle, then, the, existing, interpretations, of, the, hubble, constant, and, the, hubble, tension, have, to, be, revised, which, might, resolve, the, hubble, tension, in, particular, we, would, need, to, be, located, within, a, very, large, void, up, to, about, a, redshift, of, 0, 5, for, such, an, explanation, to, not, be, in, tension, with, supernovae, and, baryon, acoustic, oscillation, observations, yet, another, possibility, is, that, the, uncertainties, in, the, measurements, could, have, been, underestimated, finally, another, possibility, is, new, physics, beyond, the, currently, accepted, cosmological, model, of, the, universe, the, cdm, model, there, are, very, many, theories, in, this, category, for, example, replacing, general, relativity, with, a, modified, theory, of, gravity, could, potentially, resolve, the, tension, as, can, a, dark, energy, component, in, the, early, universe, dark, energy, with, a, time, varying, equation, of, state, or, dark, matter, that, decays, into, dark, radiation, a, problem, faced, by, all, these, theories, is, that, both, early, universe, and, late, universe, measurements, rely, on, multiple, independent, lines, of, physics, and, it, is, difficult, to, modify, any, of, those, lines, while, preserving, their, successes, elsewhere, the, scale, of, the, challenge, can, be, seen, from, how, some, authors, have, argued, that, new, early, universe, physics, alone, is, not, sufficient, while, other, authors, argue, that, new, late, universe, physics, alone, is, also, not, sufficient, nonetheless, astronomers, are, trying, with, interest, in, the, hubble, tension, growing, strongly, since, the, mid, 2010s, more, recent, measurements, from, the, planck, mission, published, in, 2018, indicate, a, lower, value, of, 67, 66, 0, 42, km, s, mpc, although, even, more, recently, in, march, 2019, a, higher, value, of, 74, 03, 1, 42, km, s, mpc, has, been, determined, using, an, improved, procedure, involving, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, two, measurements, disagree, at, the, 4, 4, level, beyond, a, plausible, level, of, chance, the, resolution, to, this, disagreement, is, an, ongoing, area, of, active, research, in, october, 2018, scientists, presented, a, new, third, way, two, earlier, methods, one, based, on, redshifts, and, another, on, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, gave, results, that, do, not, agree, using, information, from, gravitational, wave, events, especially, those, involving, the, merger, of, neutron, stars, like, gw170817, of, determining, the, hubble, constant, in, july, 2019, astronomers, reported, that, a, new, method, to, determine, the, hubble, constant, and, resolve, the, discrepancy, of, earlier, methods, has, been, proposed, based, on, the, mergers, of, pairs, of, neutron, stars, following, the, detection, of, the, neutron, star, merger, of, gw170817, an, event, known, as, a, dark, siren, their, measurement, of, the, hubble, constant, is, 73, 3, 5, 3, 5, 0, km, s, mpc, also, in, july, 2019, astronomers, reported, another, new, method, using, data, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, based, on, distances, to, red, giant, stars, calculated, using, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, trgb, distance, indicator, their, measurement, of, the, hubble, constant, is, 69, 8, 1, 9, 1, 9, km, s, mpc, in, february, 2020, the, megamaser, cosmology, project, published, independent, results, that, confirmed, the, distance, ladder, results, and, differed, from, the, early, universe, results, at, a, statistical, significance, level, of, 95, in, july, 2020, measurements, of, the, cosmic, background, radiation, by, the, atacama, cosmology, telescope, predict, that, the, universe, should, be, expanding, more, slowly, than, is, currently, observed, in, july, 2023, an, independent, estimate, of, the, hubble, constant, was, derived, from, the, optical, counterpart, of, a, neutron, star, merger, a, so, called, kilonova, due, to, the, blackbody, nature, of, early, kilonova, spectra, such, systems, provide, strongly, constraining, estimators, of, cosmic, distance, using, the, kilonova, at2017gfo, these, measurements, indicate, a, local, estimate, of, the, hubble, constant, of, 67, 0, 3, 6, km, s, mpc, in, august, 2024, wendy, freedman, et, al, prepublished, a, meaurement, of, the, hubble, constant, using, data, from, the, james, webb, space, telescope, to, re, measure, the, second, rung, of, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, using, standard, candle, stars, to, measure, the, distances, to, ten, nearby, galaxies, which, have, hosted, type, ia, supernovae, the, standard, candle, used, for, the, third, rung, they, used, three, different, types, of, standard, candle, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, stars, j, region, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, carbon, stars, particularly, bright, in, the, j, band, and, the, traditional, cepheid, variable, stars, the, trgb, amd, jagb, distances, agreed, with, each, other, within, 1, while, the, cepheid, measured, distances, are, a, few, percent, shorter, resulting, in, computed, hubble, constant, values, of, 69, 85, 2, 33, 67, 96, 2, 65, and, 72, 05, 3, 62, km, s, mpc, respectively, while, not, yet, conclusive, this, hints, at, the, posssibility, that, the, lower, h, 0, values, may, be, correct, and, that, higher, measurements, could, be, due, to, some, unknown, systematic, error, in, the, measurement, of, cepheid, variable, stars
