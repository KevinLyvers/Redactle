the, hydrosphere, from, ancient, greek, h, d, r, water, and, spha, ra, sphere, is, the, combined, mass, of, water, found, on, under, and, above, the, surface, of, a, planet, minor, planet, or, natural, satellite, although, earth, s, hydrosphere, has, been, around, for, about, 4, billion, years, it, continues, to, change, in, shape, this, is, caused, by, seafloor, spreading, and, continental, drift, which, rearranges, the, land, and, ocean, it, has, been, estimated, that, there, are, 1, 386, billion, cubic, kilometres, 333, million, cubic, miles, of, water, on, earth, this, includes, water, in, gaseous, liquid, and, frozen, forms, as, soil, moisture, groundwater, and, permafrost, in, the, earth, s, crust, to, a, depth, of, 2, km, oceans, and, seas, lakes, rivers, and, streams, wetlands, glaciers, ice, and, snow, cover, on, earth, s, surface, vapour, droplets, and, crystals, in, the, air, and, part, of, living, plants, animals, and, unicellular, organisms, of, the, biosphere, saltwater, accounts, for, 97, 5, of, this, amount, whereas, fresh, water, accounts, for, only, 2, 5, of, this, fresh, water, 68, 9, is, in, the, form, of, ice, and, permanent, snow, cover, in, the, arctic, the, antarctic, and, mountain, glaciers, 30, 8, is, in, the, form, of, fresh, groundwater, and, only, 0, 3, of, the, fresh, water, on, earth, is, in, easily, accessible, lakes, reservoirs, and, river, systems, the, total, mass, of, earth, s, hydrosphere, is, about, 1, 4, 10, 18, tonnes, which, is, about, 0, 023, of, earth, s, total, mass, at, any, given, time, about, 2, 10, 13, tonnes, of, this, is, in, the, form, of, water, vapor, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, for, practical, purposes, 1, cubic, metre, of, water, weighs, 1, tonne, approximately, 71, of, earth, s, surface, an, area, of, some, 361, million, square, kilometres, 139, 5, million, square, miles, is, covered, by, ocean, the, average, salinity, of, earth, s, oceans, is, about, 35, grams, of, salt, per, kilogram, of, sea, water, 3, 5, according, to, merriam, webster, the, word, hydrosphere, was, brought, into, english, in, 1887, translating, the, german, term, hydrosph, re, introduced, by, eduard, suess, the, water, cycle, refers, to, the, transfer, of, water, from, one, state, or, reservoir, to, another, reservoirs, include, atmospheric, moisture, snow, rain, and, clouds, streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, groundwater, subterranean, aquifers, polar, ice, caps, and, saturated, soil, solar, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, and, light, insolation, and, gravity, cause, the, transfer, from, one, state, to, another, over, periods, from, hours, to, thousands, of, years, most, evaporation, comes, from, the, oceans, and, is, returned, to, the, earth, as, snow, or, rain, 27, sublimation, refers, to, evaporation, from, snow, and, ice, transpiration, refers, to, the, expiration, of, water, through, the, minute, pores, or, stomata, of, trees, evapotranspiration, is, the, term, used, by, hydrologists, in, reference, to, the, three, processes, together, transpiration, sublimation, and, evaporation, marq, de, villiers, has, described, the, hydrosphere, as, a, closed, system, in, which, water, exists, the, hydrosphere, is, intricate, complex, interdependent, all, pervading, stable, and, seems, purpose, built, for, regulating, life, 26, de, villiers, claimed, that, on, earth, the, total, amount, of, water, has, almost, certainly, not, changed, since, geological, times, what, we, had, then, we, still, have, water, can, be, polluted, abused, and, misused, but, it, is, neither, created, nor, destroyed, it, only, migrates, there, is, no, evidence, that, water, vapor, escapes, into, space, 26, every, year, the, turnover, of, water, on, earth, involves, 577, 000, km, 3, of, water, this, is, water, that, evaporates, from, the, oceanic, surface, 502, 800, km, 3, and, from, land, 74, 200, km, 3, the, same, amount, of, water, falls, as, atmospheric, precipitation, 458, 000, km, 3, on, the, ocean, and, 119, 000, km, 3, on, land, the, difference, between, precipitation, and, evaporation, from, the, land, surface, 119, 000, 74, 200, 44, 800, km, 3, year, represents, the, total, runoff, of, the, earth, s, rivers, 42, 700, km, 3, year, and, direct, groundwater, runoff, to, the, ocean, 2100, km, 3, year, these, are, the, principal, sources, of, fresh, water, to, support, life, necessities, and, man, s, economic, activities, water, is, a, basic, necessity, of, life, since, two, thirds, of, the, earth, is, covered, by, water, the, earth, is, also, called, the, blue, planet, and, the, watery, planet, the, hydrosphere, plays, an, important, role, in, the, existence, of, the, atmosphere, in, its, present, form, oceans, are, important, in, this, regard, when, the, earth, was, formed, it, had, only, a, very, thin, atmosphere, rich, in, hydrogen, and, helium, similar, to, the, present, atmosphere, of, mercury, later, the, gases, hydrogen, and, helium, were, expelled, from, the, atmosphere, the, gases, and, water, vapor, released, as, the, earth, cooled, became, its, present, atmosphere, other, gases, and, water, vapor, released, by, volcanoes, also, entered, the, atmosphere, as, the, earth, cooled, the, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, condensed, and, fell, as, rain, the, atmosphere, cooled, further, as, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, dissolved, into, the, rain, water, in, turn, this, further, caused, water, vapor, to, condense, and, fall, as, rain, this, rain, water, filled, the, depressions, on, the, earth, s, surface, and, formed, the, oceans, it, is, estimated, that, this, occurred, about, 4000, million, years, ago, the, first, life, forms, began, in, the, oceans, these, organisms, did, not, breathe, oxygen, later, when, cyanobacteria, evolved, the, process, of, conversion, of, carbon, dioxide, into, food, and, oxygen, began, as, a, result, earth, s, atmosphere, has, a, distinctly, different, composition, from, that, of, other, planets, and, allowed, for, life, to, evolve, on, earth, human, activity, has, had, an, impact, on, the, water, cycle, infrastructure, like, dams, have, a, clear, direct, impact, on, the, water, cycle, by, blocking, and, redirecting, water, pathways, human, caused, pollution, has, changed, the, biogeochemical, cycles, of, some, water, systems, and, climate, change, has, significantly, altered, weather, patterns, water, withdrawals, have, exponentially, increased, because, of, agriculture, state, and, domestic, use, and, infrastructure, according, to, igor, a, shiklomanov, it, takes, 2500, years, for, the, complete, recharge, and, replenishment, of, oceanic, waters, 10, 000, years, for, permafrost, and, ice, 1500, years, for, deep, groundwater, and, mountainous, glaciers, 17, years, in, lakes, and, 16, days, in, rivers, specific, water, availability, is, the, residual, after, use, per, capita, quantity, of, fresh, water, fresh, water, resources, are, unevenly, distributed, in, terms, of, space, and, time, and, can, go, from, floods, to, water, shortages, within, months, in, the, same, area, in, 1998, 76, of, the, total, population, had, a, specific, water, availability, of, less, than, 5, 0, thousand, m, 3, per, year, per, capita, already, by, 1998, 35, of, the, global, population, suffered, very, low, or, catastrophically, low, water, supplies, and, shiklomanov, predicted, that, the, situation, would, deteriorate, in, the, twenty, first, century, with, most, of, the, earth, s, population, living, under, the, conditions, of, low, or, catastrophically, low, water, supply, by, 2025, only, 2, 5, of, the, water, in, the, hydrosphere, is, fresh, water, and, only, 0, 25, of, that, water, is, accessible, for, our, use, the, activities, of, modern, humans, have, drastic, effects, on, the, hydrosphere, for, instance, water, diversion, human, development, and, pollution, all, affect, the, hydrosphere, and, natural, processes, within, humans, are, withdrawing, water, from, aquifers, and, diverting, rivers, at, an, unprecedented, rate, the, ogallala, aquifer, is, used, for, agriculture, in, the, united, states, if, the, aquifer, goes, dry, more, than, 20, billion, worth, of, food, and, fiber, will, vanish, from, the, world, s, markets, the, aquifer, is, being, depleted, so, much, faster, than, it, is, replenished, that, eventually, the, aquifer, will, run, dry, additionally, only, one, third, of, rivers, are, free, flowing, due, to, the, extensive, use, of, dams, levees, hydropower, and, habitat, degradation, excessive, water, use, has, also, caused, intermittent, streams, to, become, more, dry, which, is, dangerous, because, they, are, extremely, important, for, water, purification, and, habitat, other, ways, humans, impact, the, hydrosphere, include, eutrophication, acid, rain, and, ocean, acidification, humans, also, rely, on, the, health, of, the, hydrosphere, it, is, used, for, water, supply, navigation, fishing, agriculture, energy, and, recreation
