black, body, radiation, is, the, thermal, electromagnetic, radiation, within, or, surrounding, a, body, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, with, its, environment, emitted, by, a, black, body, an, idealized, opaque, non, reflective, body, it, has, a, specific, continuous, spectrum, of, wavelengths, inversely, related, to, intensity, that, depend, only, on, the, body, s, temperature, which, is, assumed, for, the, sake, of, calculations, and, theory, to, be, uniform, and, constant, a, perfectly, insulated, enclosure, which, is, in, thermal, equilibrium, internally, contains, blackbody, radiation, and, will, emit, it, through, a, hole, made, in, its, wall, provided, the, hole, is, small, enough, to, have, a, negligible, effect, upon, the, equilibrium, the, thermal, radiation, spontaneously, emitted, by, many, ordinary, objects, can, be, approximated, as, blackbody, radiation, of, particular, importance, although, planets, and, stars, including, the, earth, and, sun, are, neither, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, their, surroundings, nor, perfect, black, bodies, blackbody, radiation, is, still, a, good, first, approximation, for, the, energy, they, emit, the, term, black, body, was, introduced, by, gustav, kirchhoff, in, 1860, blackbody, radiation, is, also, called, thermal, radiation, cavity, radiation, complete, radiation, or, temperature, radiation, black, body, radiation, has, a, characteristic, continuous, frequency, spectrum, that, depends, only, on, the, body, s, temperature, called, the, planck, spectrum, or, planck, s, law, the, spectrum, is, peaked, at, a, characteristic, frequency, that, shifts, to, higher, frequencies, with, increasing, temperature, and, at, room, temperature, most, of, the, emission, is, in, the, infrared, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, as, the, temperature, increases, past, about, 500, degrees, celsius, black, bodies, start, to, emit, significant, amounts, of, visible, light, viewed, in, the, dark, by, the, human, eye, the, first, faint, glow, appears, as, a, ghostly, grey, the, visible, light, is, actually, red, but, low, intensity, light, activates, only, the, eye, s, grey, level, sensors, with, rising, temperature, the, glow, becomes, visible, even, when, there, is, some, background, surrounding, light, first, as, a, dull, red, then, yellow, and, eventually, a, dazzling, bluish, white, as, the, temperature, rises, when, the, body, appears, white, it, is, emitting, a, substantial, fraction, of, its, energy, as, ultraviolet, radiation, the, sun, with, an, effective, temperature, of, approximately, 5800, k, is, an, approximate, black, body, with, an, emission, spectrum, peaked, in, the, central, yellow, green, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, but, with, significant, power, in, the, ultraviolet, as, well, blackbody, radiation, provides, insight, into, the, thermodynamic, equilibrium, state, of, cavity, radiation, all, normal, baryonic, matter, emits, electromagnetic, radiation, when, it, has, a, temperature, above, absolute, zero, the, radiation, represents, a, conversion, of, a, body, s, internal, energy, into, electromagnetic, energy, and, is, therefore, called, thermal, radiation, it, is, a, spontaneous, process, of, radiative, distribution, of, entropy, conversely, all, normal, matter, absorbs, electromagnetic, radiation, to, some, degree, an, object, that, absorbs, all, radiation, falling, on, it, at, all, wavelengths, is, called, a, black, body, when, a, black, body, is, at, a, uniform, temperature, its, emission, has, a, characteristic, frequency, distribution, that, depends, on, the, temperature, its, emission, is, called, blackbody, radiation, the, concept, of, the, black, body, is, an, idealization, as, perfect, black, bodies, do, not, exist, in, nature, however, graphite, and, lamp, black, with, emissivities, greater, than, 0, 95, are, good, approximations, to, a, black, material, experimentally, blackbody, radiation, may, be, established, best, as, the, ultimately, stable, steady, state, equilibrium, radiation, in, a, cavity, in, a, rigid, body, at, a, uniform, temperature, that, is, entirely, opaque, and, is, only, partly, reflective, a, closed, box, with, walls, of, graphite, at, a, constant, temperature, with, a, small, hole, on, one, side, produces, a, good, approximation, to, ideal, blackbody, radiation, emanating, from, the, opening, blackbody, radiation, has, the, unique, absolutely, stable, distribution, of, radiative, intensity, that, can, persist, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, in, a, cavity, in, equilibrium, for, each, frequency, the, intensity, of, radiation, which, is, emitted, and, reflected, from, a, body, relative, to, other, frequencies, that, is, the, net, amount, of, radiation, leaving, its, surface, called, the, spectral, radiance, is, determined, solely, by, the, equilibrium, temperature, and, does, not, depend, upon, the, shape, material, or, structure, of, the, body, for, a, black, body, a, perfect, absorber, there, is, no, reflected, radiation, and, so, the, spectral, radiance, is, entirely, due, to, emission, in, addition, a, black, body, is, a, diffuse, emitter, its, emission, is, independent, of, direction, blackbody, radiation, becomes, a, visible, glow, of, light, if, the, temperature, of, the, object, is, high, enough, the, draper, point, is, the, temperature, at, which, all, solids, glow, a, dim, red, about, 798, k, at, 1000, k, a, small, opening, in, the, wall, of, a, large, uniformly, heated, opaque, walled, cavity, such, as, an, oven, viewed, from, outside, looks, red, at, 6000, k, it, looks, white, no, matter, how, the, oven, is, constructed, or, of, what, material, as, long, as, it, is, built, so, that, almost, all, light, entering, is, absorbed, by, its, walls, it, will, contain, a, good, approximation, to, blackbody, radiation, the, spectrum, and, therefore, color, of, the, light, that, comes, out, will, be, a, function, of, the, cavity, temperature, alone, a, graph, of, the, spectral, radiation, intensity, plotted, versus, frequency, or, wavelength, is, called, the, blackbody, curve, different, curves, are, obtained, by, varying, the, temperature, when, the, body, is, black, the, absorption, is, obvious, the, amount, of, light, absorbed, is, all, the, light, that, hits, the, surface, for, a, black, body, much, bigger, than, the, wavelength, the, light, energy, absorbed, at, any, wavelength, per, unit, time, is, strictly, proportional, to, the, blackbody, curve, this, means, that, the, blackbody, curve, is, the, amount, of, light, energy, emitted, by, a, black, body, which, justifies, the, name, this, is, the, condition, for, the, applicability, of, kirchhoff, s, law, of, thermal, radiation, the, blackbody, curve, is, characteristic, of, thermal, light, which, depends, only, on, the, temperature, of, the, walls, of, the, cavity, provided, that, the, walls, of, the, cavity, are, completely, opaque, and, are, not, very, reflective, and, that, the, cavity, is, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, when, the, black, body, is, small, so, that, its, size, is, comparable, to, the, wavelength, of, light, the, absorption, is, modified, because, a, small, object, is, not, an, efficient, absorber, of, light, of, long, wavelength, but, the, principle, of, strict, equality, of, emission, and, absorption, is, always, upheld, in, a, condition, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, in, the, laboratory, blackbody, radiation, is, approximated, by, the, radiation, from, a, small, hole, in, a, large, cavity, a, hohlraum, in, an, entirely, opaque, body, that, is, only, partly, reflective, that, is, maintained, at, a, constant, temperature, this, technique, leads, to, the, alternative, term, cavity, radiation, any, light, entering, the, hole, would, have, to, reflect, off, the, walls, of, the, cavity, multiple, times, before, it, escaped, in, which, process, it, is, nearly, certain, to, be, absorbed, absorption, occurs, regardless, of, the, wavelength, of, the, radiation, entering, as, long, as, it, is, small, compared, to, the, hole, the, hole, then, is, a, close, approximation, of, a, theoretical, black, body, and, if, the, cavity, is, heated, the, spectrum, of, the, hole, s, radiation, that, is, the, amount, of, light, emitted, from, the, hole, at, each, wavelength, will, be, continuous, and, will, depend, only, on, the, temperature, and, the, fact, that, the, walls, are, opaque, and, at, least, partly, absorptive, but, not, on, the, particular, material, of, which, they, are, built, nor, on, the, material, in, the, cavity, compare, with, emission, spectrum, the, radiance, or, observed, intensity, is, not, a, function, of, direction, therefore, a, black, body, is, a, perfect, lambertian, radiator, real, objects, never, behave, as, full, ideal, black, bodies, and, instead, the, emitted, radiation, at, a, given, frequency, is, a, fraction, of, what, the, ideal, emission, would, be, the, emissivity, of, a, material, specifies, how, well, a, real, body, radiates, energy, as, compared, with, a, black, body, this, emissivity, depends, on, factors, such, as, temperature, emission, angle, and, wavelength, however, it, is, typical, in, engineering, to, assume, that, a, surface, s, spectral, emissivity, and, absorptivity, do, not, depend, on, wavelength, so, that, the, emissivity, is, a, constant, this, is, known, as, the, gray, body, assumption, with, non, black, surfaces, the, deviations, from, ideal, blackbody, behavior, are, determined, by, both, the, surface, structure, such, as, roughness, or, granularity, and, the, chemical, composition, on, a, per, wavelength, basis, real, objects, in, states, of, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, still, follow, kirchhoff, s, law, emissivity, equals, absorptivity, so, that, an, object, that, does, not, absorb, all, incident, light, will, also, emit, less, radiation, than, an, ideal, black, body, the, incomplete, absorption, can, be, due, to, some, of, the, incident, light, being, transmitted, through, the, body, or, to, some, of, it, being, reflected, at, the, surface, of, the, body, in, astronomy, objects, such, as, stars, are, frequently, regarded, as, black, bodies, though, this, is, often, a, poor, approximation, an, almost, perfect, blackbody, spectrum, is, exhibited, by, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, hawking, radiation, is, the, hypothetical, blackbody, radiation, emitted, by, black, holes, at, a, temperature, that, depends, on, the, mass, charge, and, spin, of, the, hole, if, this, prediction, is, correct, black, holes, will, very, gradually, shrink, and, evaporate, over, time, as, they, lose, mass, by, the, emission, of, photons, and, other, particles, a, black, body, radiates, energy, at, all, frequencies, but, its, intensity, rapidly, tends, to, zero, at, high, frequencies, short, wavelengths, for, example, a, black, body, at, room, temperature, 300, k, with, one, square, meter, of, surface, area, will, emit, a, photon, in, the, visible, range, 390, 750, nm, at, an, average, rate, of, one, photon, every, 41, seconds, meaning, that, for, most, practical, purposes, such, a, black, body, does, not, emit, in, the, visible, range, the, study, of, the, laws, of, black, bodies, and, the, failure, of, classical, physics, to, describe, them, helped, establish, the, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, according, to, the, classical, theory, of, radiation, if, each, fourier, mode, of, the, equilibrium, radiation, in, an, otherwise, empty, cavity, with, perfectly, reflective, walls, is, considered, as, a, degree, of, freedom, capable, of, exchanging, energy, then, according, to, the, equipartition, theorem, of, classical, physics, there, would, be, an, equal, amount, of, energy, in, each, mode, since, there, are, an, infinite, number, of, modes, this, would, imply, infinite, heat, capacity, as, well, as, a, nonphysical, spectrum, of, emitted, radiation, that, grows, without, bound, with, increasing, frequency, a, problem, known, as, the, ultraviolet, catastrophe, in, the, longer, wavelengths, this, deviation, is, not, so, noticeable, as, h, displaystyle, h, nu, and, n, h, displaystyle, nh, nu, are, very, small, in, the, shorter, wavelengths, of, the, ultraviolet, range, however, classical, theory, predicts, the, energy, emitted, tends, to, infinity, hence, the, ultraviolet, catastrophe, the, theory, even, predicted, that, all, bodies, would, emit, most, of, their, energy, in, the, ultraviolet, range, clearly, contradicted, by, the, experimental, data, which, showed, a, different, peak, wavelength, at, different, temperatures, see, also, wien, s, law, instead, in, the, quantum, treatment, of, this, problem, the, numbers, of, the, energy, modes, are, quantized, attenuating, the, spectrum, at, high, frequency, in, agreement, with, experimental, observation, and, resolving, the, catastrophe, the, modes, that, had, more, energy, than, the, thermal, energy, of, the, substance, itself, were, not, considered, and, because, of, quantization, modes, having, infinitesimally, little, energy, were, excluded, thus, for, shorter, wavelengths, very, few, modes, having, energy, more, than, h, displaystyle, h, nu, were, allowed, supporting, the, data, that, the, energy, emitted, is, reduced, for, wavelengths, less, than, the, wavelength, of, the, observed, peak, of, emission, notice, that, there, are, two, factors, responsible, for, the, shape, of, the, graph, which, can, be, seen, as, working, opposite, to, one, another, firstly, shorter, wavelengths, have, a, larger, number, of, modes, associated, with, them, this, accounts, for, the, increase, in, spectral, radiance, as, one, moves, from, the, longest, wavelengths, towards, the, peak, at, relatively, shorter, wavelengths, secondly, though, at, shorter, wavelengths, more, energy, is, needed, to, reach, the, threshold, level, to, occupy, each, mode, the, more, energy, needed, to, excite, the, mode, the, lower, the, probability, that, this, mode, will, be, occupied, as, the, wavelength, decreases, the, probability, of, exciting, the, mode, becomes, exceedingly, small, leading, to, fewer, of, these, modes, being, occupied, this, accounts, for, the, decrease, in, spectral, radiance, at, very, short, wavelengths, left, of, the, peak, combined, they, give, the, characteristic, graph, calculating, the, blackbody, curve, was, a, major, challenge, in, theoretical, physics, during, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, problem, was, solved, in, 1901, by, max, planck, in, the, formalism, now, known, as, planck, s, law, of, blackbody, radiation, by, making, changes, to, wien, s, radiation, law, not, to, be, confused, with, wien, s, displacement, law, consistent, with, thermodynamics, and, electromagnetism, he, found, a, mathematical, expression, fitting, the, experimental, data, satisfactorily, planck, had, to, assume, that, the, energy, of, the, oscillators, in, the, cavity, was, quantized, which, is, to, say, that, it, existed, in, integer, multiples, of, some, quantity, einstein, built, on, this, idea, and, proposed, the, quantization, of, electromagnetic, radiation, itself, in, 1905, to, explain, the, photoelectric, effect, these, theoretical, advances, eventually, resulted, in, the, superseding, of, classical, electromagnetism, by, quantum, electrodynamics, these, quanta, were, called, photons, and, the, blackbody, cavity, was, thought, of, as, containing, a, gas, of, photons, in, addition, it, led, to, the, development, of, quantum, probability, distributions, called, fermi, dirac, statistics, and, bose, einstein, statistics, each, applicable, to, a, different, class, of, particles, fermions, and, bosons, the, wavelength, at, which, the, radiation, is, strongest, is, given, by, wien, s, displacement, law, and, the, overall, power, emitted, per, unit, area, is, given, by, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, so, as, temperature, increases, the, glow, color, changes, from, red, to, yellow, to, white, to, blue, even, as, the, peak, wavelength, moves, into, the, ultra, violet, enough, radiation, continues, to, be, emitted, in, the, blue, wavelengths, that, the, body, will, continue, to, appear, blue, it, will, never, become, invisible, indeed, the, radiation, of, visible, light, increases, monotonically, with, temperature, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, also, says, that, the, total, radiant, heat, energy, emitted, from, a, surface, is, proportional, to, the, fourth, power, of, its, absolute, temperature, the, law, was, formulated, by, josef, stefan, in, 1879, and, later, derived, by, ludwig, boltzmann, the, formula, e, t, 4, is, given, where, e, is, the, radiant, heat, emitted, from, a, unit, of, area, per, unit, time, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, 5, 670, 367, 10, 8, w, m, 2, k, 4, is, the, stefan, boltzmann, constant, planck, s, law, states, that, b, t, 2, h, 3, c, 2, 1, e, h, k, t, 1, displaystyle, b, nu, t, frac, 2h, nu, 3, c, 2, frac, 1, e, h, nu, kt, 1, where, for, a, black, body, surface, the, spectral, radiance, density, defined, per, unit, of, area, normal, to, the, propagation, is, independent, of, the, angle, displaystyle, theta, of, emission, with, respect, to, the, normal, however, this, means, that, following, lambert, s, cosine, law, b, t, cos, displaystyle, b, nu, t, cos, theta, is, the, radiance, density, per, unit, area, of, emitting, surface, as, the, surface, area, involved, in, generating, the, radiance, is, increased, by, a, factor, 1, cos, displaystyle, 1, cos, theta, with, respect, to, an, area, normal, to, the, propagation, direction, at, oblique, angles,

related, to, the, photon, flux, density, b, t, e, displaystyle, b, nu, t, e, through, b, t, e, e, b, t, e, displaystyle, b, nu, t, e, eb, nu, t, e, wien, s, displacement, law, shows, how, the, spectrum, of, blackbody, radiation, at, any, temperature, is, related, to, the, spectrum, at, any, other, temperature, if, we, know, the, shape, of, the, spectrum, at, one, temperature, we, can, calculate, the, shape, at, any, other, temperature, spectral, intensity, can, be, expressed, as, a, function, of, wavelength, or, of, frequency, a, consequence, of, wien, s, displacement, law, is, that, the, wavelength, at, which, the, intensity, per, unit, wavelength, of, the, radiation, produced, by, a, black, body, has, a, local, maximum, or, peak, peak, displaystyle, lambda, text, peak, is, a, function, only, of, the, temperature, peak, b, t, displaystyle, lambda, text, peak, frac, b, t, where, the, constant, b, known, as, wien, s, displacement, constant, is, equal, to, h, c, k, 1, 5, w,

and, convection, are, insufficient, to, maintain, a, steady, state, temperature, but, evaporation, from, the, lungs, occurs, regardless, free, convection, rates, are, comparable, albeit, somewhat,

because, of, its, high, temperature, the, sun, emits, to, a, large, extent, in, the, ultraviolet, and, visible, uv, vis, frequency, range, in, this, frequency, range, the, planet, reflects, a, fraction, displaystyle, alpha, of, this, energy, where, displaystyle, alpha, is, the, albedo, or, reflectance, of, the, planet, in, the, uv, vis, range, in, other, words, the, planet, absorbs, a, fraction, 1, displaystyle, 1, alpha, of, the, sun, s, light, and, reflects, the, rest, the, power, absorbed, by, the, planet, and, its, atmosphere, is, then, even, though, the, planet, only, absorbs, as, a, circular, area, r, 2, displaystyle, pi, r, 2, it, emits, in, all, directions, the, spherical, surface, area, being, 4, r, 2, displaystyle, 4, pi, r, 2, if, the, planet, were, a, perfect, black, body, it, would, emit, according, to, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, where, t, e, displaystyle, t, rm, e, is, the, temperature, of, the, planet, this, temperature, calculated, for, the, case, of, the, planet, acting, as, a, black, body, by, setting, p, a, b, s, p, e, m, t, b, b, displaystyle, p, rm, abs, p, rm, emt, bb, is, known, as, the, effective, temperature, the, actual, temperature, of, the, planet, will, likely, be, different, depending, on, its, surface, and, atmospheric, properties, ignoring, the, atmosphere, and, greenhouse, effect, the, planet, since, it, is, at, a, much, lower, temperature, than, the, sun, emits, mostly, in, the, infrared, ir, portion, of, the, spectrum, in, this, frequency, range, it, emits, displaystyle, overline, epsilon, of, the, radiation, that, a, black, body, would, emit, where, displaystyle, overline, epsilon, is, the, average, emissivity, in, the, ir, range, the, power, emitted, by, the, planet, is, then, for, a, body, in, radiative, exchange, equilibrium, with, its, surroundings, the, rate, at, which, it, emits, radiant, energy, is, equal, to, the, rate, at, which, it, absorbs, it, substituting, the, expressions, for, solar, and, planet, power, in, equations, 1, 6, and, simplifying, yields, the, estimated, temperature, of, the, planet, ignoring, greenhouse, effect, t, p, in, other, words, given, the, assumptions, made, the, temperature, of, a, planet, depends, only, on, the, surface, temperature, of, the, sun, the, radius, of, the, sun, the, distance, between, the, planet, and, the, sun, the, albedo, and, the, ir, emissivity, of, the, planet, notice, that, a, gray, flat, spectrum, ball, where, 1, displaystyle, 1, alpha, overline, varepsilon, comes, to, the, same, temperature, as, a, black, body, no, matter, how, dark, or, light, gray, substituting, the, measured, values, for, the, sun, and, earth, yields, with, the, average, emissivity, displaystyle, overline, varepsilon, set, to, unity, the, effective, temperature, of, the, earth, is, t, e, 254, 356, k, displaystyle, t, rm, e, 254, 356, mathrm, k, or, 18, 8, c, this, is, the, temperature, of, the, earth, if, it, radiated, as, a, perfect, black, body, in, the, infrared, assuming, an, unchanging, albedo, and, ignoring, greenhouse, effects, which, can, raise, the, surface, temperature, of, a, body, above, what, it, would, be, if, it, were, a, perfect, black, body, in, all, spectrums, the, earth, in, fact, radiates, not, quite, as, a, perfect, black, body, in, the, infrared, which, will, raise, the, estimated, temperature, a, few, degrees, above, the, effective, temperature, if, we, wish, to, estimate, what, the, temperature, of, the, earth, would, be, if, it, had, no, atmosphere, then, we, could, take, the, albedo, and, emissivity, of, the, moon, as, a, good, estimate, the, albedo, and, emissivity, of, the, moon, are, about, 0, 1054, and, 0, 95, respectively, yielding, an, estimated, temperature, of, about, 1, 36, c, estimates, of, the, earth, s, average, albedo, vary, in, the, range, 0, 3, 0, 4, resulting, in, different, estimated, effective, temperatures, estimates, are, often, based, on, the, solar, constant, total, insolation, power, density, rather, than, the, temperature, size, and, distance, of, the, sun, for, example, using, 0, 4, for, albedo, and, an, insolation, of, 1400, w, m, 2, one, obtains, an, effective, temperature, of, about, 245, k, similarly, using, albedo, 0, 3, and, solar, constant, of, 1372, w, m, 2, one, obtains, an, effective, temperature, of, 255, k, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, observed, today, is, the, most, perfect, blackbody, radiation, ever, observed, in, nature, with, a, temperature, of, about, 2, 7, k, it, is, a, snapshot, of, the, radiation, at, the, time, of, decoupling, between, matter, and, radiation, in, the, early, universe, prior, to, this, time, most, matter, in, the, universe, was, in, the, form, of, an, ionized, plasma, in, thermal, though, not, full, thermodynamic, equilibrium, with, radiation, according, to, kondepudi, and, prigogine, at, very, high, temperatures, above, 10, 10, k, such, temperatures, existed, in, the, very, early, universe, where, the, thermal, motion, separates, protons, and, neutrons, in, spite, of, the, strong, nuclear, forces, electron, positron, pairs, appear, and, disappear, spontaneously, and, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, electromagnetic, radiation, these, particles, form, a, part, of, the, black, body, spectrum, in, addition, to, the, electromagnetic, radiation, a, black, body, at, room, temperature, 23, c, 296, k, 73, f, radiates, mostly, in, the, infrared, spectrum, which, cannot, be, perceived, by, the, human, eye, but, can, be, sensed, by, some, reptiles, as, the, object, increases, in, temperature, to, about, 500, c, 773, k, 932, f, the, emission, spectrum, gets, stronger, and, extends, into, the, human, visual, range, and, the, object, appears, dull, red, as, its, temperature, increases, further, it, emits, more, and, more, orange, yellow, green, and, then, blue, light, and, ultimately, beyond, violet, ultraviolet, tungsten, filament, lights, have, a, continuous, black, body, spectrum, with, a, cooler, colour, temperature, around, 2, 700, k, 2, 430, c, 4, 400, f, which, also, emits, considerable, energy, in, the, infrared, range, modern, day, fluorescent, and, led, lights, which, are, more, efficient, do, not, have, a, continuous, black, body, emission, spectrum, rather, emitting, directly, or, using, combinations, of, phosphors, that, emit, multiple, narrow, spectrums, in, his, first, memoir, augustin, jean, fresnel, 1788, 1827, responded, to, a, view, he, extracted, from, a, french, translation, of, isaac, newton, s, optics, he, says, that, newton, imagined, particles, of, light, traversing, space, uninhibited, by, the, caloric, medium, filling, it, and, refutes, this, view, never, actually, held, by, newton, by, saying, that, a, black, body, under, illumination, would, increase, indefinitely, in, heat, in, 1858, balfour, stewart, described, his, experiments, on, the, thermal, radiative, emissive, and, absorptive, powers, of, polished, plates, of, various, substances, compared, with, the, powers, of, lamp, black, surfaces, at, the, same, temperature, stewart, chose, lamp, black, surfaces, as, his, reference, because, of, various, previous, experimental, findings, especially, those, of, pierre, prevost, and, of, john, leslie, he, wrote, lamp, black, which, absorbs, all, the, rays, that, fall, upon, it, and, therefore, possesses, the, greatest, possible, absorbing, power, will, possess, also, the, greatest, possible, radiating, power, stewart, s, statement, assumed, a, general, principle, that, there, exists, a, body, or, surface, that, has, the, greatest, possible, absorbing, and, radiative, power, for, every, wavelength, and, equilibrium, temperature, stewart, was, concerned, with, selective, thermal, radiation, which, he, investigated, using, plates, which, selectively, radiated, and, absorbed, different, wavelengths, he, discussed, the, experiments, in, terms, of, rays, which, could, be, reflected, and, refracted, and, which, obeyed, the, stokes, helmholtz, reciprocity, principle, his, research, did, not, consider, that, properties, of, rays, are, dependent, on, wavelength, and, he, did, not, use, tools, such, as, prisms, or, diffraction, gratings, his, work, was, quantitative, within, these, constraints, he, made, his, measurements, in, a, room, temperature, environment, and, quickly, so, as, to, catch, his, bodies, in, a, condition, near, the, thermal, equilibrium, in, which, they, had, been, prepared, in, 1859, gustav, robert, kirchhoff, reported, the, coincidence, of, the, wavelengths, of, spectrally, resolved, lines, of, absorption, and, emission, of, visible, light, importantly, for, thermal, physics, he, also, observed, that, bright, lines, or, dark, lines, were, apparent, depending, on, the, temperature, difference, between, emitter, and, absorber, kirchhoff, then, went, on, to, consider, some, bodies, that, emit, and, absorb, heat, radiation, in, an, opaque, enclosure, or, cavity, in, equilibrium, at, a, temperature, t, here, is, used, a, notation, different, from, kirchhoff, s, here, the, emitting, power, e, t, i, denotes, a, dimensioned, quantity, the, total, radiation, emitted, by, a, body, labeled, by, index, i, at, temperature, t, the, total, absorption, ratio, a, t, i, of, that, body, is, dimensionless, the, ratio, of, absorbed, to, incident, radiation, in, the, cavity, at, temperature, t, in, contrast, with, balfour, stewart, s, kirchhoff, s, definition, of, his, absorption, ratio, did, not, refer, in, particular, to, a, lamp, black, surface, as, the, source, of, the, incident, radiation, thus, the, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, of, emitting, power, to, absorptivity, is, a, dimensioned, quantity, with, the, dimensions, of, emitting, power, because, a, t, i, is, dimensionless, also, here, the, wavelength, specific, emitting, power, of, the, body, at, temperature, t, is, denoted, by, e, t, i, and, the, wavelength, specific, absorption, ratio, by, a, t, i, again, the, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, of, emitting, power, to, absorptivity, is, a, dimensioned, quantity, with, the, dimensions, of, emitting, power, in, a, second, report, made, in, 1859, kirchhoff, announced, a, new, general, principle, or, law, for, which, he, offered, a, theoretical, and, mathematical, proof, though, he, did, not, offer, quantitative, measurements, of, radiation, powers, his, theoretical, proof, was, and, still, is, considered, by, some, writers, to, be, invalid, his, principle, however, has, endured, it, was, that, for, heat, rays, of, the, same, wavelength, in, equilibrium, at, a, given, temperature, the, wavelength, specific, ratio, of, emitting, power, to, absorptivity, has, one, and, the, same, common, value, for, all, bodies, that, emit, and, absorb, at, that, wavelength, in, symbols, the, law, stated, that, the, wavelength, specific, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, has, one, and, the, same, value, for, all, bodies, in, this, report, there, was, no, mention, of, black, bodies, in, 1860, still, not, knowing, of, stewart, s, measurements, for, selected, qualities, of, radiation, kirchhoff, pointed, out, that, it, was, long, established, experimentally, that, for, total, heat, radiation, emitted, and, absorbed, by, a, body, in, equilibrium, the, dimensioned, total, radiation, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, has, one, and, the, same, value, common, to, all, bodies, again, without, measurements, of, radiative, powers, or, other, new, experimental, data, kirchhoff, then, offered, a, fresh, theoretical, proof, of, his, new, principle, of, the, universality, of, the, value, of, the, wavelength, specific, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, at, thermal, equilibrium, his, fresh, theoretical, proof, was, and, still, is, considered, by, some, writers, to, be, invalid, but, more, importantly, it, relied, on, a, new, theoretical, postulate, of, perfectly, black, bodies, which, is, the, reason, why, one, speaks, of, kirchhoff, s, law, such, black, bodies, showed, complete, absorption, in, their, infinitely, thin, most, superficial, surface, they, correspond, to, balfour, stewart, s, reference, bodies, with, internal, radiation, coated, with, lamp, black, they, were, not, the, more, realistic, perfectly, black, bodies, later, considered, by, planck, planck, s, black, bodies, radiated, and, absorbed, only, by, the, material, in, their, interiors, their, interfaces, with, contiguous, media, were, only, mathematical, surfaces, capable, neither, of, absorption, nor, emission, but, only, of, reflecting, and, transmitting, with, refraction, kirchhoff, s, proof, considered, an, arbitrary, non, ideal, body, labeled, i, as, well, as, various, perfect, black, bodies, labeled, bb, it, required, that, the, bodies, be, kept, in, a, cavity, in, thermal, equilibrium, at, temperature, t, his, proof, intended, to, show, that, the, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, was, independent, of, the, nature, i, of, the, non, ideal, body, however, partly, transparent, or, partly, reflective, it, was, his, proof, first, argued, that, for, wavelength, and, at, temperature, t, at, thermal, equilibrium, all, perfectly, black, bodies, of, the, same, size, and, shape, have, the, one, and, the, same, common, value, of, emissive, power, e, t, bb, with, the, dimensions, of, power, his, proof, noted, that, the, dimensionless, wavelength, specific, absorptivity, a, t, bb, of, a, perfectly, black, body, is, by, definition, exactly, 1, then, for, a, perfectly, black, body, the, wavelength, specific, ratio, of, emissive, power, to, absorptivity, e, t, bb, a, t, bb, is, again, just, e, t, bb, with, the, dimensions, of, power, kirchhoff, considered, thermal, equilibrium, with, the, arbitrary, non, ideal, body, and, with, a, perfectly, black, body, of, the, same, size, and, shape, in, place, in, his, cavity, in, equilibrium, at, temperature, t, he, argued, that, the, flows, of, heat, radiation, must, be, the, same, in, each, case, thus, he, argued, that, at, thermal, equilibrium, the, ratio, e, t, i, a, t, i, was, equal, to, e, t, bb, which, may, now, be, denoted, b, t, b, t, is, a, continuous, function, dependent, only, on, at, fixed, temperature, t, and, an, increasing, function, of, t, at, fixed, wavelength, it, vanishes, at, low, temperatures, for, visible, wavelengths, which, does, not, depend, on, the, nature, i, of, the, arbitrary, non, ideal, body, geometrical, factors, taken, into, detailed, account, by, kirchhoff, have, been, ignored, in, the, foregoing, thus, kirchhoff, s, law, of, thermal, radiation, can, be, stated, for, any, material, at, all, radiating, and, absorbing, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, at, any, given, temperature, t, for, every, wavelength, the, ratio, of, emissive, power, to, absorptivity, has, one, universal, value, which, is, characteristic, of, a, perfect, black, body, and, is, an, emissive, power, which, we, here, represent, by, b, t, for, our, notation, b, t, kirchhoff, s, original, notation, was, simply, e, kirchhoff, announced, that, the, determination, of, the, function, b, t, was, a, problem, of, the, highest, importance, though, he, recognized, that, there, would, be, experimental, difficulties, to, be, overcome, he, supposed, that, like, other, functions, that, do, not, depend, on, the, properties, of, individual, bodies, it, would, be, a, simple, function, occasionally, by, historians, that, function, b, t, has, been, called, kirchhoff, s, emission, universal, function, though, its, precise, mathematical, form, would, not, be, known, for, another, forty, years, till, it, was, discovered, by, planck, in, 1900, the, theoretical, proof, for, kirchhoff, s, universality, principle, was, worked, on, and, debated, by, various, physicists, over, the, same, time, and, later, kirchhoff, stated, later, in, 1860, that, his, theoretical, proof, was, better, than, balfour, stewart, s, and, in, some, respects, it, was, so, kirchhoff, s, 1860, paper, did, not, mention, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, and, of, course, did, not, mention, the, concept, of, entropy, which, had, not, at, that, time, been, established, in, a, more, considered, account, in, a, book, in, 1862, kirchhoff, mentioned, the, connection, of, his, law, with, carnot, s, principle, which, is, a, form, of, the, second, law, according, to, helge, kragh, quantum, theory, owes, its, origin, to, the, study, of, thermal, radiation, in, particular, to, the, blackbody, radiation, that, robert, kirchhoff, had, first, defined, in, 1859, 1860, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, causes, a, shift, in, the, frequency, f, of, light, originating, from, a, source, that, is, moving, in, relation, to, the, observer, so, that, the, wave, is, observed, to, have, frequency, f, f, f, 1, v, c, cos, 1, v, 2, c, 2, displaystyle, f, f, frac, 1, frac, v, c, cos, theta, sqrt, 1, v, 2, c, 2, where, v, is, the, velocity, of, the, source, in, the, observer, s, rest, frame, is, the, angle, between, the, velocity, vector, and, the, observer, source, direction, measured, in, the, reference, frame, of, the, source, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, this, can, be, simplified, for, the, special, cases, of, objects, moving, directly, towards, or, away, 0, from, the, observer, and, for, speeds, much, less, than, c, through, planck, s, law, the, temperature, spectrum, of, a, black, body, is, proportionally, related, to, the, frequency, of, light, and, one, may, substitute, the, temperature, t, for, the, frequency, in, this, equation, for, the, case, of, a, source, moving, directly, towards, or, away, from, the, observer, this, reduces, to, t, t, c, v, c, v, displaystyle, t, t, sqrt, frac, c, v, c, v, here, v, 0, indicates, a, receding, source, and, v, 0, indicates, an, approaching, source, this, is, an, important, effect, in, astronomy, where, the, velocities, of, stars, and, galaxies, can, reach, significant, fractions, of, c, an, example, is, found, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, which, exhibits, a, dipole, anisotropy, from, the, earth, s, motion, relative, to, this, blackbody, radiation, field
