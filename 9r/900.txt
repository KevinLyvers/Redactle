a, magnet, is, a, material, or, object, that, produces, a, magnetic, field, this, magnetic, field, is, invisible, but, is, responsible, for, the, most, notable, property, of, a, magnet, a, force, that, pulls, on, other, ferromagnetic, materials, such, as, iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc, and, attracts, or, repels, other, magnets, a, permanent, magnet, is, an, object, made, from, a, material, that, is, magnetized, and, creates, its, own, persistent, magnetic, field, an, everyday, example, is, a, refrigerator, magnet, used, to, hold, notes, on, a, refrigerator, door, materials, that, can, be, magnetized, which, are, also, the, ones, that, are, strongly, attracted, to, a, magnet, are, called, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, these, include, the, elements, iron, nickel, and, cobalt, and, their, alloys, some, alloys, of, rare, earth, metals, and, some, naturally, occurring, minerals, such, as, lodestone, although, ferromagnetic, and, ferrimagnetic, materials, are, the, only, ones, attracted, to, a, magnet, strongly, enough, to, be, commonly, considered, magnetic, all, other, substances, respond, weakly, to, a, magnetic, field, by, one, of, several, other, types, of, magnetism, ferromagnetic, materials, can, be, divided, into, magnetically, soft, materials, like, annealed, iron, which, can, be, magnetized, but, do, not, tend, to, stay, magnetized, and, magnetically, hard, materials, which, do, permanent, magnets, are, made, from, hard, ferromagnetic, materials, such, as, alnico, and, ferrite, that, are, subjected, to, special, processing, in, a, strong, magnetic, field, during, manufacture, to, align, their, internal, microcrystalline, structure, making, them, very, hard, to, demagnetize, to, demagnetize, a, saturated, magnet, a, certain, magnetic, field, must, be, applied, and, this, threshold, depends, on, coercivity, of, the, respective, material, hard, materials, have, high, coercivity, whereas, soft, materials, have, low, coercivity, the, overall, strength, of, a, magnet, is, measured, by, its, magnetic, moment, or, alternatively, the, total, magnetic, flux, it, produces, the, local, strength, of, magnetism, in, a, material, is, measured, by, its, magnetization, an, electromagnet, is, made, from, a, coil, of, wire, that, acts, as, a, magnet, when, an, electric, current, passes, through, it, but, stops, being, a, magnet, when, the, current, stops, often, the, coil, is, wrapped, around, a, core, of, soft, ferromagnetic, material, such, as, mild, steel, which, greatly, enhances, the, magnetic, field, produced, by, the, coil, ancient, people, learned, about, magnetism, from, lodestones, or, magnetite, which, are, naturally, magnetized, pieces, of, iron, ore, the, word, magnet, was, adopted, in, middle, english, from, latin, magnetum, lodestone, ultimately, from, greek, magn, tis, meaning, from, magnesia, a, place, in, anatolia, where, lodestones, were, found, today, manisa, in, modern, day, turkey, lodestones, suspended, so, they, could, turn, were, the, first, magnetic, compasses, the, earliest, known, surviving, descriptions, of, magnets, and, their, properties, are, from, anatolia, india, and, china, around, 2, 500, years, ago, the, properties, of, lodestones, and, their, affinity, for, iron, were, written, of, by, pliny, the, elder, in, his, encyclopedia, naturalis, historia, in, the, 1st, century, ad, in, 11th, century, china, it, was, discovered, that, quenching, red, hot, iron, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, would, leave, the, iron, permanently, magnetized, this, led, to, the, development, of, the, navigational, compass, as, described, in, dream, pool, essays, in, 1088, by, the, 12th, to, 13th, centuries, ad, magnetic, compasses, were, used, in, navigation, in, china, europe, the, arabian, peninsula, and, elsewhere, a, straight, iron, magnet, tends, to, demagnetize, itself, by, its, own, magnetic, field, to, overcome, this, the, horseshoe, magnet, was, invented, by, daniel, bernoulli, in, 1743, a, horseshoe, magnet, avoids, demagnetization, by, returning, the, magnetic, field, lines, to, the, opposite, pole, in, 1820, hans, christian, rsted, discovered, that, a, compass, needle, is, deflected, by, a, nearby, electric, current, in, the, same, year, andr, marie, amp, re, showed, that, iron, can, be, magnetized, by, inserting, it, in, an, electrically, fed, solenoid, this, led, william, sturgeon, to, develop, an, iron, cored, electromagnet, in, 1824, joseph, henry, further, developed, the, electromagnet, into, a, commercial, product, in, 1830, 1831, giving, people, access, to, strong, magnetic, fields, for, the, first, time, in, 1831, he, built, an, ore, separator, with, an, electromagnet, capable, of, lifting, 750, pounds, 340, kg, the, magnetic, flux, density, also, called, magnetic, b, field, or, just, magnetic, field, usually, denoted, by, b, is, a, vector, field, the, magnetic, b, field, vector, at, a, given, point, in, space, is, specified, by, two, properties, in, si, units, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, b, field, is, given, in, teslas, a, magnet, s, magnetic, moment, also, called, magnetic, dipole, moment, and, usually, denoted, is, a, vector, that, characterizes, the, magnet, s, overall, magnetic, properties, for, a, bar, magnet, the, direction, of, the, magnetic, moment, points, from, the, magnet, s, south, pole, to, its, north, pole, and, the, magnitude, relates, to, how, strong, and, how, far, apart, these, poles, are, in, si, units, the, magnetic, moment, is, specified, in, terms, of, a, m, 2, amperes, times, meters, squared, a, magnet, both, produces, its, own, magnetic, field, and, responds, to, magnetic, fields, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, it, produces, is, at, any, given, point, proportional, to, the, magnitude, of, its, magnetic, moment, in, addition, when, the, magnet, is, put, into, an, external, magnetic, field, produced, by, a, different, source, it, is, subject, to, a, torque, tending, to, orient, the, magnetic, moment, parallel, to, the, field, the, amount, of, this, torque, is, proportional, both, to, the, magnetic, moment, and, the, external, field, a, magnet, may, also, be, subject, to, a, force, driving, it, in, one, direction, or, another, according, to, the, positions, and, orientations, of, the, magnet, and, source, if, the, field, is, uniform, in, space, the, magnet, is, subject, to, no, net, force, although, it, is, subject, to, a, torque, a, wire, in, the, shape, of, a, circle, with, area, a, and, carrying, current, i, has, a, magnetic, moment, of, magnitude, equal, to, ia, the, magnetization, of, a, magnetized, material, is, the, local, value, of, its, magnetic, moment, per, unit, volume, usually, denoted, m, with, units, a, m, it, is, a, vector, field, rather, than, just, a, vector, like, the, magnetic, moment, because, different, areas, in, a, magnet, can, be, magnetized, with, different, directions, and, strengths, for, example, because, of, domains, see, below, a, good, bar, magnet, may, have, a, magnetic, moment, of, magnitude, 0, 1, a, m, 2, and, a, volume, of, 1, cm, 3, or, 1, 10, 6, m, 3, and, therefore, an, average, magnetization, magnitude, is, 100, 000, a, m, iron, can, have, a, magnetization, of, around, a, million, amperes, per, meter, such, a, large, value, explains, why, iron, magnets, are, so, effective, at, producing, magnetic, fields, two, different, models, exist, for, magnets, magnetic, poles, and, atomic, currents, although, for, many, purposes, it, is, convenient, to, think, of, a, magnet, as, having, distinct, north, and, south, magnetic, poles, the, concept, of, poles, should, not, be, taken, literally, it, is, merely, a, way, of, referring, to, the, two, different, ends, of, a, magnet, the, magnet, does, not, have, distinct, north, or, south, particles, on, opposing, sides, if, a, bar, magnet, is, broken, into, two, pieces, in, an, attempt, to, separate, the, north, and, south, poles, the, result, will, be, two, bar, magnets, each, of, which, has, both, a, north, and, south, pole, however, a, version, of, the, magnetic, pole, approach, is, used, by, professional, magneticians, to, design, permanent, magnets, in, this, approach, the, divergence, of, the, magnetization, m, inside, a, magnet, is, treated, as, a, distribution, of, magnetic, monopoles, this, is, a, mathematical, convenience, and, does, not, imply, that, there, are, actually, monopoles, in, the, magnet, if, the, magnetic, pole, distribution, is, known, then, the, pole, model, gives, the, magnetic, field, h, outside, the, magnet, the, field, b, is, proportional, to, h, while, inside, the, magnetization, must, be, added, to, h, an, extension, of, this, method, that, allows, for, internal, magnetic, charges, is, used, in, theories, of, ferromagnetism, another, model, is, the, amp, re, model, where, all, magnetization, is, due, to, the, effect, of, microscopic, or, atomic, circular, bound, currents, also, called, amp, rian, currents, throughout, the, material, for, a, uniformly, magnetized, cylindrical, bar, magnet, the, net, effect, of, the, microscopic, bound, currents, is, to, make, the, magnet, behave, as, if, there, is, a, macroscopic, sheet, of, electric, current, flowing, around, the, surface, with, local, flow, direction, normal, to, the, cylinder, axis, microscopic, currents, in, atoms, inside, the, material, are, generally, canceled, by, currents, in, neighboring, atoms, so, only, the, surface, makes, a, net, contribution, shaving, off, the, outer, layer, of, a, magnet, will, not, destroy, its, magnetic, field, but, will, leave, a, new, surface, of, uncancelled, currents, from, the, circular, currents, throughout, the, material, the, right, hand, rule, tells, which, direction, positively, charged, current, flows, however, current, due, to, negatively, charged, electricity, is, far, more, prevalent, in, practice, the, north, pole, of, a, magnet, is, defined, as, the, pole, that, when, the, magnet, is, freely, suspended, points, towards, the, earth, s, north, magnetic, pole, in, the, arctic, the, magnetic, and, geographic, poles, do, not, coincide, see, magnetic, declination, since, opposite, poles, north, and, south, attract, the, north, magnetic, pole, is, actually, the, south, pole, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, as, a, practical, matter, to, tell, which, pole, of, a, magnet, is, north, and, which, is, south, it, is, not, necessary, to, use, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, all, for, example, one, method, would, be, to, compare, it, to, an, electromagnet, whose, poles, can, be, identified, by, the, right, hand, rule, the, magnetic, field, lines, of, a, magnet, are, considered, by, convention, to, emerge, from, the, magnet, s, north, pole, and, reenter, at, the, south, pole, the, term, magnet, is, typically, reserved, for, objects, that, produce, their, own, persistent, magnetic, field, even, in, the, absence, of, an, applied, magnetic, field, only, certain, classes, of, materials, can, do, this, most, materials, however, produce, a, magnetic, field, in, response, to, an, applied, magnetic, field, a, phenomenon, known, as, magnetism, there, are, several, types, of, magnetism, and, all, materials, exhibit, at, least, one, of, them, the, overall, magnetic, behavior, of, a, material, can, vary, widely, depending, on, the, structure, of, the, material, particularly, on, its, electron, configuration, several, forms, of, magnetic, behavior, have, been, observed, in, different, materials, including, there, are, various, other, types, of, magnetism, such, as, spin, glass, superparamagnetism, superdiamagnetism, and, metamagnetism, because, human, tissues, have, a, very, low, level, of, susceptibility, to, static, magnetic, fields, there, is, little, mainstream, scientific, evidence, showing, a, health, effect, associated, with, exposure, to, static, fields, dynamic, magnetic, fields, may, be, a, different, issue, however, correlations, between, electromagnetic, radiation, and, cancer, rates, have, been, postulated, due, to, demographic, correlations, see, electromagnetic, radiation, and, health, if, a, ferromagnetic, foreign, body, is, present, in, human, tissue, an, external, magnetic, field, interacting, with, it, can, pose, a, serious, safety, risk, a, different, type, of, indirect, magnetic, health, risk, exists, involving, pacemakers, if, a, pacemaker, has, been, embedded, in, a, patient, s, chest, usually, for, the, purpose, of, monitoring, and, regulating, the, heart, for, steady, electrically, induced, beats, care, should, be, taken, to, keep, it, away, from, magnetic, fields, it, is, for, this, reason, that, a, patient, with, the, device, installed, cannot, be, tested, with, the, use, of, a, magnetic, resonance, imaging, device, children, sometimes, swallow, small, magnets, from, toys, and, this, can, be, hazardous, if, two, or, more, magnets, are, swallowed, as, the, magnets, can, pinch, or, puncture, internal, tissues, magnetic, imaging, devices, e, g, mris, generate, enormous, magnetic, fields, and, therefore, rooms, intended, to, hold, them, exclude, ferrous, metals, bringing, objects, made, of, ferrous, metals, such, as, oxygen, canisters, into, such, a, room, creates, a, severe, safety, risk, as, those, objects, may, be, powerfully, thrown, about, by, the, intense, magnetic, fields, ferromagnetic, materials, can, be, magnetized, in, the, following, ways, magnetized, ferromagnetic, materials, can, be, demagnetized, or, degaussed, in, the, following, ways, many, materials, have, unpaired, electron, spins, and, the, majority, of, these, materials, are, paramagnetic, when, the, spins, interact, with, each, other, in, such, a, way, that, the, spins, align, spontaneously, the, materials, are, called, ferromagnetic, what, is, often, loosely, termed, as, magnetic, because, of, the, way, their, regular, crystalline, atomic, structure, causes, their, spins, to, interact, some, metals, are, ferromagnetic, when, found, in, their, natural, states, as, ores, these, include, iron, ore, magnetite, or, lodestone, cobalt, and, nickel, as, well, as, the, rare, earth, metals, gadolinium, and, dysprosium, when, at, a, very, low, temperature, such, naturally, occurring, ferromagnets, were, used, in, the, first, experiments, with, magnetism, technology, has, since, expanded, the, availability, of, magnetic, materials, to, include, various, man, made, products, all, based, however, on, naturally, magnetic, elements, ceramic, or, ferrite, magnets, are, made, of, a, sintered, composite, of, powdered, iron, oxide, and, barium, strontium, carbonate, ceramic, given, the, low, cost, of, the, materials, and, manufacturing, methods, inexpensive, magnets, or, non, magnetized, ferromagnetic, cores, for, use, in, electronic, components, such, as, portable, am, radio, antennas, of, various, shapes, can, be, easily, mass, produced, the, resulting, magnets, are, non, corroding, but, brittle, and, must, be, treated, like, other, ceramics, alnico, magnets, are, made, by, casting, or, sintering, a, combination, of, aluminium, nickel, and, cobalt, with, iron, and, small, amounts, of, other, elements, added, to, enhance, the, properties, of, the, magnet, sintering, offers, superior, mechanical, characteristics, whereas, casting, delivers, higher, magnetic, fields, and, allows, for, the, design, of, intricate, shapes, alnico, magnets, resist, corrosion, and, have, physical, properties, more, forgiving, than, ferrite, but, not, quite, as, desirable, as, a, metal, trade, names, for, alloys, in, this, family, include, alni, alcomax, hycomax, columax, and, ticonal, injection, molded, magnets, are, a, composite, of, various, types, of, resin, and, magnetic, powders, allowing, parts, of, complex, shapes, to, be, manufactured, by, injection, molding, the, physical, and, magnetic, properties, of, the, product, depend, on, the, raw, materials, but, are, generally, lower, in, magnetic, strength, and, resemble, plastics, in, their, physical, properties, flexible, magnets, are, composed, of, a, high, coercivity, ferromagnetic, compound, usually, ferric, oxide, mixed, with, a, resinous, polymer, binder, this, is, extruded, as, a, sheet, and, passed, over, a, line, of, powerful, cylindrical, permanent, magnets, these, magnets, are, arranged, in, a, stack, with, alternating, magnetic, poles, facing, up, n, s, n, s, on, a, rotating, shaft, this, impresses, the, plastic, sheet, with, the, magnetic, poles, in, an, alternating, line, format, no, electromagnetism, is, used, to, generate, the, magnets, the, pole, to, pole, distance, is, on, the, order, of, 5, mm, but, varies, with, manufacturer, these, magnets, are, lower, in, magnetic, strength, but, can, be, very, flexible, depending, on, the, binder, used, for, magnetic, compounds, e, g, nd, 2, fe, 14, b, that, are, vulnerable, to, a, grain, boundary, corrosion, problem, it, gives, additional, protection, rare, earth, lanthanoid, elements, have, a, partially, occupied, f, electron, shell, which, can, accommodate, up, to, 14, electrons, the, spin, of, these, electrons, can, be, aligned, resulting, in, very, strong, magnetic, fields, and, therefore, these, elements, are, used, in, compact, high, strength, magnets, where, their, higher, price, is, not, a, concern, the, most, common, types, of, rare, earth, magnets, are, samarium, cobalt, and, neodymium, iron, boron, nib, magnets, in, the, 1990s, it, was, discovered, that, certain, molecules, containing, paramagnetic, metal, ions, are, capable, of, storing, a, magnetic, moment, at, very, low, temperatures, these, are, very, different, from, conventional, magnets, that, store, information, at, a, magnetic, domain, level, and, theoretically, could, provide, a, far, denser, storage, medium, than, conventional, magnets, in, this, direction, research, on, monolayers, of, smms, is, currently, under, way, very, briefly, the, two, main, attributes, of, an, smm, are, most, smms, contain, manganese, but, can, also, be, found, with, vanadium, iron, nickel, and, cobalt, clusters, more, recently, it, has, been, found, that, some, chain, systems, can, also, display, a, magnetization, that, persists, for, long, times, at, higher, temperatures, these, systems, have, been, called, single, chain, magnets, some, nano, structured, materials, exhibit, energy, waves, called, magnons, that, coalesce, into, a, common, ground, state, in, the, manner, of, a, bose, einstein, condensate, the, united, states, department, of, energy, has, identified, a, need, to, find, substitutes, for, rare, earth, metals, in, permanent, magnet, technology, and, has, begun, funding, such, research, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, energy, arpa, e, has, sponsored, a, rare, earth, alternatives, in, critical, technologies, react, program, to, develop, alternative, materials, in, 2011, arpa, e, awarded, 31, 6, million, dollars, to, fund, rare, earth, substitute, projects, iron, nitrides, are, promising, materials, for, rare, earth, free, magnets, the, current, cheapest, permanent, magnets, allowing, for, field, strengths, are, flexible, and, ceramic, magnets, but, these, are, also, among, the, weakest, types, the, ferrite, magnets, are, mainly, low, cost, magnets, since, they, are, made, from, cheap, raw, materials, iron, oxide, and, ba, or, sr, carbonate, however, a, new, low, cost, magnet, mn, al, alloy, has, been, developed, and, is, now, dominating, the, low, cost, magnets, field, it, has, a, higher, saturation, magnetization, than, the, ferrite, magnets, it, also, has, more, favorable, temperature, coefficients, although, it, can, be, thermally, unstable, neodymium, iron, boron, nib, magnets, are, among, the, strongest, these, cost, more, per, kilogram, than, most, other, magnetic, materials, but, owing, to, their, intense, field, are, smaller, and, cheaper, in, many, applications, temperature, sensitivity, varies, but, when, a, magnet, is, heated, to, a, temperature, known, as, the, curie, point, it, loses, all, of, its, magnetism, even, after, cooling, below, that, temperature, the, magnets, can, often, be, remagnetized, however, additionally, some, magnets, are, brittle, and, can, fracture, at, high, temperatures, the, maximum, usable, temperature, is, highest, for, alnico, magnets, at, over, 540, c, 1, 000, f, around, 300, c, 570, f, for, ferrite, and, smco, about, 140, c, 280, f, for, nib, and, lower, for, flexible, ceramics, but, the, exact, numbers, depend, on, the, grade, of, material, an, electromagnet, in, its, simplest, form, is, a, wire, that, has, been, coiled, into, one, or, more, loops, known, as, a, solenoid, when, electric, current, flows, through, the, wire, a, magnetic, field, is, generated, it, is, concentrated, near, and, especially, inside, the, coil, and, its, field, lines, are, very, similar, to, those, of, a, magnet, the, orientation, of, this, effective, magnet, is, determined, by, the, right, hand, rule, the, magnetic, moment, and, the, magnetic, field, of, the, electromagnet, are, proportional, to, the, number, of, loops, of, wire, to, the, cross, section, of, each, loop, and, to, the, current, passing, through, the, wire, if, the, coil, of, wire, is, wrapped, around, a, material, with, no, special, magnetic, properties, e, g, cardboard, it, will, tend, to, generate, a, very, weak, field, however, if, it, is, wrapped, around, a, soft, ferromagnetic, material, such, as, an, iron, nail, then, the, net, field, produced, can, result, in, a, several, hundred, to, thousandfold, increase, of, field, strength, uses, for, electromagnets, include, particle, accelerators, electric, motors, junkyard, cranes, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, machines, some, applications, involve, configurations, more, than, a, simple, magnetic, dipole, for, example, quadrupole, and, sextupole, magnets, are, used, to, focus, particle, beams, for, most, engineering, applications, mks, rationalized, or, si, syst, me, international, units, are, commonly, used, two, other, sets, of, units, gaussian, and, cgs, emu, are, the, same, for, magnetic, properties, and, are, commonly, used, in, physics, in, all, units, it, is, convenient, to, employ, two, types, of, magnetic, field, b, and, h, as, well, as, the, magnetization, m, defined, as, the, magnetic, moment, per, unit, volume, materials, that, are, not, permanent, magnets, usually, satisfy, the, relation, m, h, in, si, where, is, the, dimensionless, magnetic, susceptibility, most, non, magnetic, materials, have, a, relatively, small, on, the, order, of, a, millionth, but, soft, magnets, can, have, on, the, order, of, hundreds, or, thousands, for, materials, satisfying, m, h, we, can, also, write, b, 0, 1, h, 0, r, h, h, where, r, 1, is, the, dimensionless, relative, permeability, and, 0, r, is, the, magnetic, permeability, both, hard, and, soft, magnets, have, a, more, complex, history, dependent, behavior, described, by, what, are, called, hysteresis, loops, which, give, either, b, vs, h, or, m, vs, h, in, cgs, m, h, but, si, 4, cgs, and, r, caution, in, part, because, there, are, not, enough, roman, and, greek, symbols, there, is, no, commonly, agreed, upon, symbol, for, magnetic, pole, strength, and, magnetic, moment, the, symbol, m, has, been, used, for, both, pole, strength, unit, a, m, where, here, the, upright, m, is, for, meter, and, for, magnetic, moment, unit, a, m, 2, the, symbol, has, been, used, in, some, texts, for, magnetic, permeability, and, in, other, texts, for, magnetic, moment, we, will, use, for, magnetic, permeability, and, m, for, magnetic, moment, for, pole, strength, we, will, employ, q, m, for, a, bar, magnet, of, cross, section, a, with, uniform, magnetization, m, along, its, axis, the, pole, strength, is, given, by, q, m, ma, so, that, m, can, be, thought, of, as, a, pole, strength, per, unit, area, far, away, from, a, magnet, the, magnetic, field, created, by, that, magnet, is, almost, always, described, to, a, good, approximation, by, a, dipole, field, characterized, by, its, total, magnetic, moment, this, is, true, regardless, of, the, shape, of, the, magnet, so, long, as, the, magnetic, moment, is, non, zero, one, characteristic, of, a, dipole, field, is, that, the, strength, of, the, field, falls, off, inversely, with, the, cube, of, the, distance, from, the, magnet, s, center, closer, to, the, magnet, the, magnetic, field, becomes, more, complicated, and, more, dependent, on, the, detailed, shape, and, magnetization, of, the, magnet, formally, the, field, can, be, expressed, as, a, multipole, expansion, a, dipole, field, plus, a, quadrupole, field, plus, an, octupole, field, etc, at, close, range, many, different, fields, are, possible, for, example, for, a, long, skinny, bar, magnet, with, its, north, pole, at, one, end, and, south, pole, at, the, other, the, magnetic, field, near, either, end, falls, off, inversely, with, the, square, of, the, distance, from, that, pole, the, strength, of, a, given, magnet, is, sometimes, given, in, terms, of, its, pull, force, its, ability, to, pull, ferromagnetic, objects, the, pull, force, exerted, by, either, an, electromagnet, or, a, permanent, magnet, with, no, air, gap, i, e, the, ferromagnetic, object, is, in, direct, contact, with, the, pole, of, the, magnet, is, given, by, the, maxwell, equation, where, this, result, can, be, easily, derived, using, gilbert, model, which, assumes, that, the, pole, of, magnet, is, charged, with, magnetic, monopoles, that, induces, the, same, in, the, ferromagnetic, object, if, a, magnet, is, acting, vertically, it, can, lift, a, mass, m, in, kilograms, given, by, the, simple, equation, where, g, is, the, gravitational, acceleration, classically, the, force, between, two, magnetic, poles, is, given, by, where, the, pole, description, is, useful, to, the, engineers, designing, real, world, magnets, but, real, magnets, have, a, pole, distribution, more, complex, than, a, single, north, and, south, therefore, implementation, of, the, pole, idea, is, not, simple, in, some, cases, one, of, the, more, complex, formulae, given, below, will, be, more, useful, the, mechanical, force, between, two, nearby, magnetized, surfaces, can, be, calculated, with, the, following, equation, the, equation, is, valid, only, for, cases, in, which, the, effect, of, fringing, is, negligible, and, the, volume, of, the, air, gap, is, much, smaller, than, that, of, the, magnetized, material, where, the, force, between, two, identical, cylindrical, bar, magnets, placed, end, to, end, at, large, distance, z, r, displaystyle, z, gg, r, is, approximately, where, note, that, all, these, formulations, are, based, on, gilbert, s, model, which, is, usable, in, relatively, great, distances, in, other, models, e, g, amp, re, s, model, a, more, complicated, formulation, is, used, that, sometimes, cannot, be, solved, analytically, in, these, cases, numerical, methods, must, be, used, for, two, cylindrical, magnets, with, radius, r, displaystyle, r, and, length, l, displaystyle, l, with, their, magnetic, dipole, aligned, the, force, can, be, asymptotically, approximated, at, large, distance, z, r, displaystyle, z, gg, r, by, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, magnetization, of, the, magnets, and, z, displaystyle, z, is, the, gap, between, the, magnets, a, measurement, of, the, magnetic, flux, density, very, close, to, the, magnet, b, 0, displaystyle, b, 0, is, related, to, m, displaystyle, m, approximately, by, the, formula, the, effective, magnetic, dipole, can, be, written, as, where, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, volume, of, the, magnet, for, a, cylinder, this, is, v, r, 2, l, displaystyle, v, pi, r, 2, l, when, z, l, displaystyle, z, gg, l, the, point, dipole, approximation, is, obtained, which, matches, the, expression, of, the, force, between, two, magnetic, dipoles
