in, newtonian, mechanics, momentum, pl, momenta, or, momentums, more, specifically, linear, momentum, or, translational, momentum, is, the, product, of, the, mass, and, velocity, of, an, object, it, is, a, vector, quantity, possessing, a, magnitude, and, a, direction, if, m, is, an, object, s, mass, and, v, is, its, velocity, also, a, vector, quantity, then, the, object, s, momentum, p, from, latin, pellere, push, drive, is, p, m, v, displaystyle, mathbf, p, m, mathbf, v, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, unit, of, measurement, of, momentum, is, the, kilogram, metre, per, second, kg, m, s, which, is, dimensionally, equivalent, to, the, newton, second, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, states, that, the, rate, of, change, of, a, body, s, momentum, is, equal, to, the, net, force, acting, on, it, momentum, depends, on, the, frame, of, reference, but, in, any, inertial, frame, it, is, a, conserved, quantity, meaning, that, if, a, closed, system, is, not, affected, by, external, forces, its, total, linear, momentum, does, not, change, momentum, is, also, conserved, in, special, relativity, with, a, modified, formula, and, in, a, modified, form, in, electrodynamics, quantum, mechanics, quantum, field, theory, and, general, relativity, it, is, an, expression, of, one, of, the, fundamental, symmetries, of, space, and, time, translational, symmetry, advanced, formulations, of, classical, mechanics, lagrangian, and, hamiltonian, mechanics, allow, one, to, choose, coordinate, systems, that, incorporate, symmetries, and, constraints, in, these, systems, the, conserved, quantity, is, generalized, momentum, and, in, general, this, is, different, from, the, kinetic, momentum, defined, above, the, concept, of, generalized, momentum, is, carried, over, into, quantum, mechanics, where, it, becomes, an, operator, on, a, wave, function, the, momentum, and, position, operators, are, related, by, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, in, continuous, systems, such, as, electromagnetic, fields, fluid, dynamics, and, deformable, bodies, a, momentum, density, can, be, defined, and, a, continuum, version, of, the, conservation, of, momentum, leads, to, equations, such, as, the, navier, stokes, equations, for, fluids, or, the, cauchy, momentum, equation, for, deformable, solids, or, fluids, momentum, is, a, vector, quantity, it, has, both, magnitude, and, direction, since, momentum, has, a, direction, it, can, be, used, to, predict, the, resulting, direction, and, speed, of, motion, of, objects, after, they, collide, below, the, basic, properties, of, momentum, are, described, in, one, dimension, the, vector, equations, are, almost, identical, to, the, scalar, equations, see, multiple, dimensions, the, momentum, of, a, particle, is, conventionally, represented, by, the, letter, p, it, is, the, product, of, two, quantities, the, particle, s, mass, represented, by, the, letter, m, and, its, velocity, v, p, m, v, displaystyle, p, mv, the, unit, of, momentum, is, the, product, of, the, units, of, mass, and, velocity, in, si, units, if, the, mass, is, in, kilograms, and, the, velocity, is, in, meters, per, second, then, the, momentum, is, in, kilogram, meters, per, second, kg, m, s, in, cgs, units, if, the, mass, is, in, grams, and, the, velocity, in, centimeters, per, second, then, the, momentum, is, in, gram, centimeters, per, second, g, cm, s, being, a, vector, momentum, has, magnitude, and, direction, for, example, a, 1, kg, model, airplane, traveling, due, north, at, 1, m, s, in, straight, and, level, flight, has, a, momentum, of, 1, kg, m, s, due, north, measured, with, reference, to, the, ground, the, momentum, of, a, system, of, particles, is, the, vector, sum, of, their, momenta, if, two, particles, have, respective, masses, m, 1, and, m, 2, and, velocities, v, 1, and, v, 2, the, total, momentum, is, p, p, 1, p, 2, m, 1, v, 1, m, 2, v, 2, displaystyle, begin, aligned, p, p, 1, p, 2, m, 1, v, 1, m, 2, v, 2, end, aligned, the, momenta, of, more, than, two, particles, can, be, added, more, generally, with, the, following, p, i, m, i, v, i, displaystyle, p, sum, i, m, i, v, i, a, system, of, particles, has, a, center, of, mass, a, point, determined, by, the, weighted, sum, of, their, positions, r, cm, m, 1, r, 1, m, 2, r, 2, m, 1, m, 2, i, m, i, r, i, i, m, i, displaystyle,

will, generally, be, moving, as, well, unless, the, system, is, in, pure, rotation, around, it, if, the, total, mass, of, the, particles, is, m, displaystyle, m, and, the, center, of, mass, is, moving, at, velocity, v, cm, the, momentum, of, the, system, is, p, m, v, cm, displaystyle, p, mv, text, cm, this, is, known, as, euler, s, first, law, if, the, net, force, f, applied, to, a, particle, is, constant, and, is, applied, for, a, time, interval, t, the, momentum, of, the, particle, changes, by, an, amount, p, f, t, displaystyle, delta, p, f, delta, t, in, differential, form, this, is, newton, s, second, law, the, rate, of, change, of, the, momentum, of, a, particle, is, equal, to, the, instantaneous, force, f, acting, on, it, f, d, p, d, t, displaystyle, f, frac, text, d, p, text, d, t, if, the, net, force, experienced, by, a, particle, changes, as, a, function, of, time, f, t, the, change, in, momentum, or, impulse, j, between, times, t, 1, and, t, 2, is, p, j, t, 1, t, 2, f, t, d, t, displaystyle, delta, p, j, int, t, 1, t, 2, f, t, text, d, t, impulse, is, measured, in, the, derived, units, of, the, newton, second, 1, n, s, 1, kg, m, s, or, dyne, second, 1, dyne, s, 1, g, cm, s, under, the, assumption, of, constant, mass, m, it, is, equivalent, to, write, f, d, m, v, d, t, m, d, v, d, t, m, a, displaystyle, f, frac, text, d, mv, text, d, t, m, frac, text, d, v, text, d, t, ma, hence, the, net, force, is, equal, to, the, mass, of, the, particle, times, its, acceleration, example, a, model, airplane, of, mass, 1, kg, accelerates, from, rest, to, a, velocity, of, 6, m, s, due, north, in, 2, s, the, net, force, required, to, produce, this, acceleration, is, 3, newtons, due, north, the, change, in, momentum, is, 6, kg, m, s, due, north, the, rate, of, change, of, momentum, is, 3, kg, m, s, s, due, north, which, is, numerically, equivalent, to, 3, newtons, in, a, closed, system, one, that, does, not, exchange, any, matter, with, its, surroundings, and, is, not, acted, on, by, external, forces, the, total, momentum, remains, constant, this, fact, known, as, the, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, is, implied, by, newton, s, laws, of, motion, suppose, for, example, that, two, particles, interact, as, explained, by, the, third, law, the, forces, between, them, are, equal, in, magnitude, but, opposite, in, direction, if, the, particles, are, numbered, 1, and, 2, the, second, law, states, that, f, 1, d, p, 1, d, t, and, f, 2, d, p, 2, d, t, therefore, d, p, 1, d, t, d, p, 2, d, t, displaystyle, frac, text, d, p, 1, text, d,

right, 0, if, the, velocities, of, the, particles, are, v, a1, and, v, b1, before, the, interaction, and, afterwards, they, are, v, a2, and, v, b2, then, m, a, v, a, 1, m, b, v, b, 1, m, a, v, a, 2, m, b, v, b, 2, displaystyle, m, a, v, a1, m, b, v, b1, m, a, v, a2, m, b, v, b2, this, law, holds, no, matter, how, complicated, the, force, is, between, particles, similarly, if, there, are, several, particles, the, momentum, exchanged, between, each, pair, of, particles, adds, to, zero, so, the, total, change, in, momentum, is, zero, the, conservation, of, the, total, momentum, of, a, number, of, interacting, particles, can, be, expressed, as, m, a, v, a, m, b, v, b, m, c, v, c, c, o, n, s, t, a, n, t, displaystyle, m, a, v, a, m, b, v, b, m, c, v, c, constant, this, conservation, law, applies, to, all, interactions, including, collisions, both, elastic, and, inelastic, and, separations, caused, by, explosive, forces, it, can, also, be, generalized, to, situations, where, newton, s, laws, do, not, hold, for, example, in, the, theory, of, relativity, and, in, electrodynamics, momentum, is, a, measurable, quantity, and, the, measurement, depends, on, the, frame, of, reference, for, example, if, an, aircraft, of, mass, 1000, kg, is, flying, through, the, air, at, a, speed, of, 50, m, s, its, momentum, can, be, calculated, to, be, 50, 000, kg, m, s, if, the, aircraft, is, flying, into, a, headwind, of, 5, m, s, its, speed, relative, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, only, 45, m, s, and, its, momentum, can, be, calculated, to, be, 45, 000, kg, m, s, both, calculations, are, equally, correct, in, both, frames, of, reference, any, change, in, momentum, will, be, found, to, be, consistent, with, the, relevant, laws, of, physics, suppose, x, is, a, position, in, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, from, the, point, of, view, of, another, frame, of, reference, moving, at, a, constant, speed, u, relative, to, the, other, the, position, represented, by, a, primed, coordinate, changes, with, time, as, x, x, u, t, displaystyle, x, x, ut, this, is, called, a, galilean, transformation, if, a, particle, is, moving, at, speed, d, x, d, t, v, in, the, first, frame, of, reference, in, the, second, it, is, moving, at, speed, v, d, x, d, t, v, u, displaystyle, v, frac, text, d, x, text, d, t, v, u, since, u, does, not, change, the, second, reference, frame, is, also, an, inertial, frame, and, the, accelerations, are, the, same, a, d, v, d, t, a, displaystyle, a, frac, text, d, v, text, d, t, a, thus, momentum, is, conserved, in, both, reference, frames, moreover, as, long, as, the, force, has, the, same, form, in, both, frames, newton, s, second, law, is, unchanged, forces, such, as, newtonian, gravity, which, depend, only, on, the, scalar, distance, between, objects, satisfy, this, criterion, this, independence, of, reference, frame, is, called, newtonian, relativity, or, galilean, invariance, a, change, of, reference, frame, can, often, simplify, calculations, of, motion, for, example, in, a, collision, of, two, particles, a, reference, frame, can, be, chosen, where, one, particle, begins, at, rest, another, commonly, used, reference, frame, is, the, center, of, mass, frame, one, that, is, moving, with, the, center, of, mass, in, this, frame, the, total, momentum, is, zero, if, two, particles, each, of, known, momentum, collide, and, coalesce, the, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, can, be, used, to, determine, the, momentum, of, the, coalesced, body, if, the, outcome, of, the, collision, is, that, the, two, particles, separate, the, law, is, not, sufficient, to, determine, the, momentum, of, each, particle, if, the, momentum, of, one, particle, after, the, collision, is, known, the, law, can, be, used, to, determine, the, momentum, of, the, other, particle, alternatively, if, the, combined, kinetic, energy, after, the, collision, is, known, the, law, can, be, used, to, determine, the, momentum, of, each, particle, after, the, collision, kinetic, energy, is, usually, not, conserved, if, it, is, conserved, the, collision, is, called, an, elastic, collision, if, not, it, is, an, inelastic, collision, an, elastic, collision, is, one, in, which, no, kinetic, energy, is, transformed, into, heat, or, some, other, form, of, energy, perfectly, elastic, collisions, can, occur, when, the, objects, do, not, touch, each, other, as, for, example, in, atomic, or, nuclear, scattering, where, electric, repulsion, keeps, the, objects, apart, a, slingshot, maneuver, of, a, satellite, around, a, planet, can, also, be, viewed, as, a, perfectly, elastic, collision, a, collision, between, two, pool, balls, is, a, good, example, of, an, almost, totally, elastic, collision, due, to, their, high, rigidity, but, when, bodies, come, in, contact, there, is, always, some, dissipation, a, head, on, elastic, collision, between, two, bodies, can, be, represented, by, velocities, in, one, dimension, along, a, line, passing, through, the, bodies, if, the, velocities, are, v, a1, and, v, b1, before, the, collision, and, v, a2, and, v, b2, after, the, equations, expressing, conservation, of, momentum, and, kinetic, energy, are, m, a, v, a, 1, m, b, v, b, 1, m, a, v, a, 2, m, b, v, b, 2, 1, 2, m, a, v, a, 1, 2, 1, 2, m, b, v, b, 1, 2, 1, 2, m, a, v, a, 2, 2, 1, 2, m, b, v, b, 2, 2,

end, aligned, a, change, of, reference, frame, can, simplify, analysis, of, a, collision, for, example, suppose, there, are, two, bodies, of, equal, mass, m, one, stationary, and, one, approaching, the, other, at, a, speed, v, as, in, the, figure, the, center, of, mass, is, moving, at, speed, v, 2, and, both, bodies, are, moving, towards, it, at, speed, v, 2, because, of, the, symmetry, after, the, collision, both, must, be, moving, away, from, the, center, of, mass, at, the, same, speed, adding, the, speed, of, the, center, of, mass, to, both, we, find, that, the, body, that, was, moving, is, now, stopped, and, the, other, is, moving, away, at, speed, v, the, bodies, have, exchanged, their, velocities, regardless, of, the, velocities, of, the, bodies, a, switch, to, the, center, of, mass, frame, leads, us, to, the, same, conclusion, therefore, the, final, velocities, are, given, by, v, a, 2, v, b, 1, v, b, 2, v, a, 1, displaystyle, begin, aligned, v, a2, v, b1, v, b2, v, a1, end, aligned, in, general, when, the, initial, velocities, are, known, the, final, velocities, are, given, by, v, a, 2, m, a, m, b, m, a, m, b, v, a, 1, 2, m, b, m, a, m, b, v, b, 1, v, b, 2, m, b, m, a,

frac, m, b, m, a, m, a, m, b, right, v, b1, left, frac, 2m, a, m, a, m, b, right, v, a1, end, aligned, if, one, body, has, much, greater, mass, than, the, other, its, velocity, will, be, little, affected, by, a, collision, while, the, other, body, will, experience, a, large, change, in, an, inelastic, collision, some, of, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, colliding, bodies, is, converted, into, other, forms, of, energy, such, as, heat, or, sound, examples, include, traffic, collisions, in, which, the, effect, of, loss, of, kinetic, energy, can, be, seen, in, the, damage, to, the, vehicles, electrons, losing, some, of, their, energy, to, atoms, as, in, the, franck, hertz, experiment, and, particle, accelerators, in, which, the, kinetic, energy, is, converted, into, mass, in, the, form, of, new, particles, in, a, perfectly, inelastic, collision, such, as, a, bug, hitting, a, windshield, both, bodies, have, the, same, motion, afterwards, a, head, on, inelastic, collision, between, two, bodies, can, be, represented, by, velocities, in, one, dimension, along, a, line, passing, through, the, bodies, if, the, velocities, are, v, a1, and, v, b1, before, the, collision, then, in, a, perfectly, inelastic, collision, both, bodies, will, be, travelling, with, velocity, v, 2, after, the, collision, the, equation, expressing, conservation, of, momentum, is, m, a, v, a, 1, m, b, v, b,

objects, would, be, brought, to, rest, by, a, perfectly, inelastic, collision, and, 100, of, the, kinetic, energy, is, converted, to, other, forms, of, energy, in, this, instance, the, initial, velocities, of, the, bodies, would, be, non, zero, or, the, bodies, would, have, to, be, massless, one, measure, of, the, inelasticity, of, the, collision, is, the, coefficient, of, restitution, c, r, defined, as, the, ratio, of, relative, velocity, of, separation, to, relative, velocity, of, approach, in, applying, this, measure, to, a, ball, bouncing, from, a, solid, surface, this, can, be,

energy, stored, in, chemical, mechanical, or, nuclear, form, into, kinetic, energy, acoustic, energy, and, electromagnetic, radiation, rockets, also, make, use, of, conservation, of, momentum, propellant, is, thrust, outward, gaining, momentum, and, an, equal, and, opposite, momentum, is, imparted, to, the, rocket, real, motion, has, both, direction, and, velocity, and, must, be,

elastic, sphere, is, struck, by, a, moving, sphere, the, two, will, head, off, at, right, angles, after, the, collision, as, in, the, figure, the, concept, of, momentum, plays, a, fundamental, role, in, explaining, the, behavior, of, variable, mass, objects, such, as, a, rocket, ejecting, fuel, or, a, star, accreting, gas, in, analyzing, such, an, object, one, treats, the, object, s, mass, as, a,

newtonian, physics, assumes, that, absolute, time, and, space, exist, outside, of, any, observer, this, gives, rise, to, galilean, invariance, it, also, results, in, a, prediction, that, the, speed, of, light, can, vary, from, one, reference, frame, to, another, this, is, contrary, to, what, has, been, observed, in, the, special, theory, of, relativity, einstein, keeps, the, postulate, that, the,

claimed, that, everything, that, is, moving, must, be, kept, moving, by, something, for, example, a, thrown, ball, must, be, kept, moving, by, motions, of, the, air, philoponus, pointed, out, the, absurdity, in, aristotle, s, claim, that, motion, of, an, object, is, promoted, by, the, same, air, that, is, resisting, its, passage, he, proposed, instead, that, an, impetus, was, imparted, to, the, object, in, the, act, of, throwing, it, in, 1020, ibn, s, n, also, known, by, his, latinized, name, avicenna, read, philoponus, and, published, his, own, theory, of, motion, in, the, book, of, healing, he, agreed, that, an, impetus, is, imparted, to, a, projectile, by, the, thrower, but, unlike, philoponus, who, believed, that, it, was, a, temporary, virtue, that, would, decline, even, in, a, vacuum, he, viewed, it, as, a, persistent, requiring, external, forces, such, as, air, resistance, to, dissipate, it, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, century, peter, olivi, and, jean, buridan, read, and, refined, the, work, of, philoponus, and, possibly, that, of, ibn, s, n, buridan, who, in, about, 1350, was, made, rector, of, the, university, of, paris, referred, to, impetus, being, proportional, to, the, weight, times, the, speed, moreover, buridan, s, theory, was, different, from, his, predecessor, s, in, that, he, did, not, consider, impetus, to, be, self, dissipating, asserting, that, a, body, would, be, arrested, by, the, forces, of, air, resistance, and, gravity, which, might, be, opposing, its, impetus, in, principles, of, philosophy, principia, philosophiae, from, 1644, the, french, philosopher, ren, descartes, defined, quantity, of, motion, latin, quantitas, motus, as, the, product, of, size, and, speed, and, claimed, that, the, total, quantity, of, motion, in, the, universe, is, conserved, if, x, is, twice, the, size, of, y, and, is, moving, half, as, fast, then, there, s, the, same, amount, of, motion, in, each, created, matter, along, with, its, motion, merely, by, letting, things, run, their, course, he, preserves, the, same, amount, of, motion, as, he, put, there, in, the, beginning, this, should, not, be, read, as, a, statement, of, the, modern, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, since, descartes, had, no, concept, of, mass, as, distinct, from, weight, and, size, the, concept, of, mass, as, distinct, from, weight, was, introduced, by, newton, in, 1686, more, important, he, believed, that, it, is, speed, rather, than, velocity, that, is, conserved, so, for, descartes, if, a, moving, object, were, to, bounce, off, a, surface, changing, its, direction, but, not, its, speed, there, would, be, no, change, in, its, quantity, of, motion, galileo, in, his, two, new, sciences, published, in, 1638, used, the, italian, word, impeto, to, similarly, describe, descartes, s, quantity, of, motion, in, the, 1600s, christiaan, huygens, concluded, quite, early, that, descartes, s, laws, for, the, elastic, collision, of, two, bodies, must, be, wrong, and, he, formulated, the, correct, laws, an, important, step, was, his, recognition, of, the, galilean, invariance, of, the, problems, his, views, then, took, many, years, to, be, circulated, he, passed, them, on, in, person, to, william, brouncker, and, christopher, wren, in, london, in, 1661, what, spinoza, wrote, to, henry, oldenburg, about, them, in, 1666, during, the, second, anglo, dutch, war, was, guarded, huygens, had, actually, worked, them, out, in, a, manuscript, de, motu, corporum, ex, percussione, in, the, period, 1652, 1656, the, war, ended, in, 1667, and, huygens, announced, his, results, to, the, royal, society, in, 1668, he, published, them, in, the, journal, des, s, avans, in, 1669, in, 1670, john, wallis, in, mechanica, sive, de, motu, tractatus, geometricus, stated, the, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, the, initial, state, of, the, body, either, of, rest, or, of, motion, will, persist, and, if, the, force, is, greater, than, the, resistance, motion, will, result, wallis, used, momentum, for, quantity, of, motion, and, vis, for, force, in, 1686, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, in, discourse, on, metaphysics, gave, an, argument, against, descartes, construction, of, the, conservation, of, the, quantity, of, motion, using, an, example, of, dropping, blocks, of, different, sizes, different, distances, he, points, out, that, force, is, conserved, but, quantity, of, motion, construed, as, the, product, of, size, and, speed, of, an, object, is, not, conserved, in, 1687, isaac, newton, in, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, just, like, wallis, showed, a, similar, casting, around, for, words, to, use, for, the, mathematical, momentum, his, definition, ii, defines, quantitas, motus, quantity, of, motion, as, arising, from, the, velocity, and, quantity, of, matter, conjointly, which, identifies, it, as, momentum, thus, when, in, law, ii, he, refers, to, mutatio, motus, change, of, motion, being, proportional, to, the, force, impressed, he, is, generally, taken, to, mean, momentum, and, not, motion, in, 1721, john, jennings, published, miscellanea, where, the, momentum, in, its, current, mathematical, sense, is, attested, five, years, before, the, final, edition, of, newton, s, principia, mathematica, momentum, m, or, quantity, of, motion, was, being, defined, for, students, as, a, rectangle, the, product, of, q, and, v, where, q, is, quantity, of, material, and, v, is, velocity, s, t, in, 1728, the, cyclopedia, states, the, momentum, impetus, or, quantity, of, motion, of, any, body, is, the, factum, of, its, velocity, or, the, space, it, moves, in, a, given, time, see, motion, multiplied, into, its, mass
