barium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ba, and, atomic, number, 56, it, is, the, fifth, element, in, group, 2, and, is, a, soft, silvery, alkaline, earth, metal, because, of, its, high, chemical, reactivity, barium, is, never, found, in, nature, as, a, free, element, the, most, common, minerals, of, barium, are, barite, barium, sulfate, baso, 4, and, witherite, barium, carbonate, baco, 3, the, name, barium, originates, from, the, alchemical, derivative, baryta, from, greek, barys, meaning, heavy, baric, is, the, adjectival, form, of, barium, barium, was, identified, as, a, new, element, in, 1772, but, not, reduced, to, a, metal, until, 1808, with, the, advent, of, electrolysis, barium, has, few, industrial, applications, historically, it, was, used, as, a, getter, for, vacuum, tubes, and, in, oxide, form, as, the, emissive, coating, on, indirectly, heated, cathodes, it, is, a, component, of, ybco, high, temperature, superconductors, and, electroceramics, and, is, added, to, steel, and, cast, iron, to, reduce, the, size, of, carbon, grains, within, the, microstructure, barium, compounds, are, added, to, fireworks, to, impart, a, green, color, barium, sulfate, is, used, as, an, insoluble, additive, to, oil, well, drilling, fluid, in, a, purer, form, it, is, used, as, x, ray, radiocontrast, agents, for, imaging, the, human, gastrointestinal, tract, water, soluble, barium, compounds, are, poisonous, and, have, been, used, as, rodenticides, barium, is, a, soft, silvery, white, metal, with, a, slight, golden, shade, when, ultrapure, 2, the, silvery, white, color, of, barium, metal, rapidly, vanishes, upon, oxidation, in, air, yielding, a, dark, gray, layer, containing, the, oxide, barium, has, a, medium, specific, weight, and, high, electrical, conductivity, because, barium, is, difficult, to, purify, many, of, its, properties, have, not, been, accurately, determined, 2, at, room, temperature, and, pressure, barium, metal, adopts, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, with, a, barium, barium, distance, of, 503, picometers, expanding, with, heating, at, a, rate, of, approximately, 1, 8, 10, 5, c, 2, it, is, a, soft, metal, with, a, mohs, hardness, of, 1, 25, 2, its, melting, temperature, of, 1, 000, k, 730, c, 1, 340, f, 4, 43, is, intermediate, between, those, of, the, lighter, strontium, 1, 050, k, or, 780, c, or, 1, 430, f, 4, 86, and, heavier, radium, 973, k, or, 700, c, or, 1, 292, f, 4, 78, however, its, boiling, point, of, 2, 170, k, 1, 900, c, 3, 450, f, exceeds, that, of, strontium, 1, 655, k, or, 1, 382, c, or, 2, 519, f, 4, 86, the, density, 3, 62, g, cm, 3, 4, 43, is, again, intermediate, between, those, of, strontium, 2, 36, g, cm, 3, 4, 86, and, radium, 5, g, cm, 3, 4, 78, barium, is, chemically, similar, to, magnesium, calcium, and, strontium, but, more, reactive, its, compounds, are, almost, invariably, found, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, as, expected, for, a, highly, electropositive, metal, barium, s, reaction, with, chalcogens, is, highly, exothermic, release, energy, barium, reacts, with, atmospheric, oxygen, in, air, at, room, temperature, for, this, reason, metallic, barium, is, often, stored, under, oil, or, in, an, inert, atmosphere, 2, reactions, with, other, nonmetals, such, as, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and, hydrogen, proceed, upon, heating, 2, 3, reactions, with, water, and, alcohols, are, also, exothermic, and, release, hydrogen, gas, 3, barium, reacts, with, ammonia, to, form, the, electride, e, 2, which, near, room, temperature, gives, the, amide, ba, nh, 2, 2, the, metal, is, readily, attacked, by, acids, sulfuric, acid, is, a, notable, exception, because, passivation, stops, the, reaction, by, forming, the, insoluble, barium, sulfate, on, the, surface, barium, combines, with, several, other, metals, including, aluminium, zinc, lead, and, tin, forming, intermetallic, phases, and, alloys, barium, salts, are, typically, white, when, solid, and, colorless, when, dissolved, they, are, denser, than, the, strontium, or, calcium, analogs, except, for, the, halides, see, table, zinc, is, given, for, comparison, barium, hydroxide, baryta, was, known, to, alchemists, who, produced, it, by, heating, barium, carbonate, unlike, calcium, hydroxide, it, absorbs, very, little, co, 2, in, aqueous, solutions, and, is, therefore, insensitive, to, atmospheric, fluctuations, this, property, is, used, in, calibrating, ph, equipment, barium, compounds, burn, with, a, green, to, pale, green, flame, which, is, an, efficient, test, to, detect, a, barium, compound, the, color, results, from, spectral, lines, at, 455, 4, 493, 4, 553, 6, and, 611, 1, nm, 3, organobarium, compounds, are, a, growing, field, of, knowledge, recently, discovered, are, dialkylbariums, and, alkylhalobariums, 3, barium, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, a, mixture, of, seven, primordial, nuclides, barium, 130, 132, and, 134, through, 138, barium, 130, undergoes, very, slow, radioactive, decay, to, xenon, 130, by, double, beta, plus, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 0, 5, 2, 7, 10, 21, years, about, 10, 11, times, the, age, of, the, universe, its, abundance, is, 0, 1, that, of, natural, barium, theoretically, barium, 132, can, similarly, undergo, double, beta, decay, to, xenon, 132, this, decay, has, not, been, detected, the, radioactivity, of, these, isotopes, is, so, weak, that, they, pose, no, danger, to, life, of, the, stable, isotopes, barium, 138, composes, 71, 7, of, all, barium, other, isotopes, have, decreasing, abundance, with, decreasing, mass, number, in, total, barium, has, 40, known, isotopes, ranging, in, mass, between, 114, and, 153, the, most, stable, artificial, radioisotope, is, barium, 133, with, a, half, life, of, approximately, 10, 51, years, five, other, isotopes, have, half, lives, longer, than, a, day, barium, also, has, 10, meta, states, of, which, barium, 133m1, is, the, most, stable, with, a, half, life, of, about, 39, hours, alchemists, in, the, early, middle, ages, knew, about, some, barium, minerals, smooth, pebble, like, stones, of, mineral, baryte, were, found, in, volcanic, rock, near, bologna, italy, and, so, were, called, bologna, stones, alchemists, were, attracted, to, them, because, after, exposure, to, light, they, would, glow, for, years, the, phosphorescent, properties, of, baryte, heated, with, organics, were, described, by, v, casciorolus, in, 1602, 5, carl, scheele, determined, that, baryte, contained, a, new, element, in, 1772, but, could, not, isolate, barium, only, barium, oxide, johan, gottlieb, gahn, also, isolated, barium, oxide, two, years, later, in, similar, studies, oxidized, barium, was, at, first, called, barote, by, guyton, de, morveau, a, name, that, was, changed, by, antoine, lavoisier, to, baryte, in, french, or, baryta, in, latin, also, in, the, 18th, century, english, mineralogist, william, withering, noted, a, heavy, mineral, in, the, lead, mines, of, cumberland, now, known, to, be, witherite, barium, was, first, isolated, by, electrolysis, of, molten, barium, salts, in, 1808, by, sir, humphry, davy, in, england, davy, by, analogy, with, calcium, named, barium, after, baryta, with, the, ium, ending, signifying, a, metallic, element, robert, bunsen, and, augustus, matthiessen, obtained, pure, barium, by, electrolysis, of, a, molten, mixture, of, barium, chloride, and, ammonium, chloride, the, production, of, pure, oxygen, in, the, brin, process, was, a, large, scale, application, of, barium, peroxide, in, the, 1880s, before, it, was, replaced, by, electrolysis, and, fractional, distillation, of, liquefied, air, in, the, early, 1900s, in, this, process, barium, oxide, reacts, at, 500, 600, c, 932, 1, 112, f, with, air, to, form, barium, peroxide, which, decomposes, above, 700, c, 1, 292, f, by, releasing, oxygen, barium, sulfate, was, first, applied, as, a, radiocontrast, agent, in, x, ray, imaging, of, the, digestive, system, in, 1908, the, abundance, of, barium, is, 0, 0425, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, 13, g, l, in, sea, water, the, primary, commercial, source, of, barium, is, baryte, also, called, barytes, or, heavy, spar, a, barium, sulfate, mineral, 5, with, deposits, in, many, parts, of, the, world, another, commercial, source, far, less, important, than, baryte, is, witherite, barium, carbonate, the, main, deposits, are, located, in, britain, romania, and, the, former, ussr, 5, the, baryte, reserves, are, estimated, between, 0, 7, and, 2, billion, tonnes, the, maximum, production, 8, 3, million, tonnes, was, produced, in, 1981, but, only, 7, 8, was, used, for, barium, metal, or, compounds, 5, baryte, production, has, risen, since, the, second, half, of, the, 1990s, from, 5, 6, million, tonnes, in, 1996, to, 7, 6, in, 2005, and, 7, 8, in, 2011, china, accounts, for, more, than, 50, of, this, output, followed, by, india, 14, in, 2011, morocco, 8, 3, us, 8, 2, turkey, 2, 5, iran, and, kazakhstan, 2, 6, each, the, mined, ore, is, washed, crushed, classified, and, separated, from, quartz, if, the, quartz, penetrates, too, deeply, into, the, ore, or, the, iron, zinc, or, lead, content, is, abnormally, high, then, froth, flotation, is, used, the, product, is, a, 98, pure, baryte, by, mass, the, purity, should, be, no, less, than, 95, with, a, minimal, content, of, iron, and, silicon, dioxide, 7, it, is, then, reduced, by, carbon, to, barium, sulfide, 6, the, water, soluble, barium, sulfide, is, the, starting, point, for, other, compounds, treating, bas, with, oxygen, produces, the, sulfate, with, nitric, acid, the, nitrate, with, aqueous, carbon, dioxide, the, carbonate, and, so, on, 6, the, nitrate, can, be, thermally, decomposed, to, yield, the, oxide, 6, barium, metal, is, produced, by, reduction, with, aluminium, at, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, the, intermetallic, compound, baal, 4, is, produced, first, 3, baal, 4, is, an, intermediate, reacted, with, barium, oxide, to, produce, the, metal, note, that, not, all, barium, is, reduced, 3, the, remaining, barium, oxide, reacts, with, the, formed, aluminium, oxide, 3, and, the, overall, reaction, is, 3, barium, vapor, is, condensed, and, packed, into, molds, in, an, atmosphere, of, argon, 3, this, method, is, used, commercially, yielding, ultrapure, barium, 3, commonly, sold, barium, is, about, 99, pure, with, main, impurities, being, strontium, and, calcium, up, to, 0, 8, and, 0, 25, and, other, contaminants, contributing, less, than, 0, 1, 4, a, similar, reaction, with, silicon, at, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, yields, barium, and, barium, metasilicate, 3, electrolysis, is, not, used, because, barium, readily, dissolves, in, molten, halides, and, the, product, is, rather, impure, 3, the, barium, mineral, benitoite, barium, titanium, silicate, occurs, as, a, very, rare, blue, fluorescent, gemstone, and, is, the, official, state, gem, of, california, barium, in, seawater, barium, exists, in, seawater, as, the, ba, 2, ion, with, an, average, oceanic, concentration, of, 109, nmol, kg, barium, also, exists, in, the, ocean, as, baso, 4, or, barite, barium, has, a, nutrient, like, profile, with, a, residence, time, of, 10, 000, years, barium, shows, a, relatively, consistent, concentration, in, upper, ocean, seawater, excepting, regions, of, high, river, inputs, and, regions, with, strong, upwelling, there, is, little, depletion, of, barium, concentrations, in, the, upper, ocean, for, an, ion, with, a, nutrient, like, profile, thus, lateral, mixing, is, important, barium, isotopic, values, show, basin, scale, balances, instead, of, local, or, short, term, processes, barium, as, a, metal, or, when, alloyed, with, aluminium, is, used, to, remove, unwanted, gases, gettering, from, vacuum, tubes, such, as, tv, picture, tubes, 4, barium, is, suitable, for, this, purpose, because, of, its, low, vapor, pressure, and, reactivity, towards, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, dioxide, and, water, it, can, even, partly, remove, noble, gases, by, dissolving, them, in, the, crystal, lattice, this, application, is, gradually, disappearing, due, to, the, rising, popularity, of, the, tubeless, lcd, led, and, plasma, sets, 4, other, uses, of, elemental, barium, are, minor, and, include, an, additive, to, silumin, aluminium, silicon, alloys, that, refines, their, structure, as, well, as, 4, barium, sulfate, the, mineral, baryte, baso, 4, is, important, to, the, petroleum, industry, as, a, drilling, fluid, in, oil, and, gas, wells, 4, 5, the, precipitate, of, the, compound, called, blanc, fixe, from, the, french, for, permanent, white, is, used, in, paints, and, varnishes, as, a, filler, in, ringing, ink, plastics, and, rubbers, as, a, paper, coating, pigment, and, in, nanoparticles, to, improve, physical, properties, of, some, polymers, such, as, epoxies, 9, barium, sulfate, has, a, low, toxicity, and, relatively, high, density, of, ca, 4, 5, g, cm, 3, and, thus, opacity, to, x, rays, for, this, reason, it, is, used, as, a, radiocontrast, agent, in, x, ray, imaging, of, the, digestive, system, barium, meals, and, barium, enemas, 4, 5, lithopone, a, pigment, that, contains, barium, sulfate, and, zinc, sulfide, is, a, permanent, white, with, good, covering, power, that, does, not, darken, when, exposed, to, sulfides, other, compounds, of, barium, find, only, niche, applications, limited, by, the, toxicity, of, ba, 2, ions, barium, carbonate, is, a, rat, poison, which, is, not, a, problem, for, the, insoluble, baso, 4, palaeoceanography, the, lateral, mixing, of, barium, is, caused, by, water, mass, mixing, and, ocean, circulation, global, ocean, circulation, reveals, a, strong, correlation, between, dissolved, barium, and, silicic, acid, the, large, scale, ocean, circulation, combined, with, remineralization, of, barium, show, a, similar, correlation, between, dissolved, barium, and, ocean, alkalinity, dissolved, barium, s, correlation, with, silicic, acid, can, be, seen, both, vertically, and, spatially, particulate, barium, shows, a, strong, correlation, with, particulate, organic, carbon, or, poc, barium, is, becoming, more, popular, to, be, used, a, base, for, palaeoceanographic, proxies, with, both, dissolved, and, particulate, barium, s, links, with, silicic, acid, and, poc, it, can, be, used, to, determine, historical, variations, in, the, biological, pump, carbon, cycle, and, global, climate, the, barium, particulate, barite, baso, 4, as, one, of, many, proxies, can, be, used, to, provide, a, host, of, historical, information, on, processes, in, different, oceanic, settings, water, column, sediments, and, hydrothermal, sites, in, each, setting, there, are, differences, in, isotopic, and, elemental, composition, of, the, barite, particulate, barite, in, the, water, column, known, as, marine, or, pelagic, barite, reveals, information, on, seawater, chemistry, variation, over, time, barite, in, sediments, known, as, diagenetic, or, cold, seeps, barite, gives, information, about, sedimentary, redox, processes, barite, formed, via, hydrothermal, activity, at, hydrothermal, vents, known, as, hydrothermal, barite, reveals, alterations, in, the, condition, of, the, earth, s, crust, around, those, vents, soluble, barium, compounds, have, ld50, near, 10, mg, kg, oral, rats, symptoms, include, convulsions, paralysis, of, the, peripheral, nerve, system, severe, inflammation, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, 18, the, insoluble, sulfate, is, nontoxic, and, is, not, classified, as, a, dangerous, goods, in, transport, regulations, little, is, known, about, the, long, term, effects, of, barium, exposure, the, us, epa, considers, it, unlikely, that, barium, is, carcinogenic, when, consumed, orally, inhaled, dust, containing, insoluble, barium, compounds, can, accumulate, in, the, lungs, causing, a, benign, condition, called, baritosis, the, insoluble,
