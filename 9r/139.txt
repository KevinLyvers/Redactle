the, orion, nebula, also, known, as, messier, 42, m42, or, ngc, 1976, is, a, diffuse, nebula, situated, in, the, milky, way, being, south, of, orion, s, belt, in, the, constellation, of, orion, and, is, known, as, the, middle, star, in, the, sword, of, orion, it, is, one, of, the, brightest, nebulae, and, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, the, night, sky, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 4, 0, it, is, 1, 344, 20, light, years, 412, 1, 6, 1, pc, away, and, is, the, closest, region, of, massive, star, formation, to, earth, the, m42, nebula, is, estimated, to, be, 24, light, years, across, so, its, apparent, size, from, earth, is, approximately, 1, degree, it, has, a, mass, of, about, 2, 000, times, that, of, the, sun, older, texts, frequently, refer, to, the, orion, nebula, as, the, great, nebula, in, orion, or, the, great, orion, nebula, the, orion, nebula, is, one, of, the, most, scrutinized, and, photographed, objects, in, the, night, sky, and, is, among, the, most, intensely, studied, celestial, features, the, nebula, has, revealed, much, about, the, process, of, how, stars, and, planetary, systems, are, formed, from, collapsing, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, astronomers, have, directly, observed, protoplanetary, disks, and, brown, dwarfs, within, the, nebula, intense, and, turbulent, motions, of, the, gas, and, the, photo, ionizing, effects, of, massive, nearby, stars, in, the, nebula, the, orion, nebula, is, visible, with, the, naked, eye, even, from, areas, affected, by, light, pollution, it, is, seen, as, the, middle, star, in, the, sword, of, orion, which, are, the, three, stars, located, south, of, orion, s, belt, the, star, appears, fuzzy, to, sharp, eyed, observers, and, the, nebulosity, is, obvious, through, binoculars, or, a, small, telescope, the, peak, surface, brightness, of, the, central, region, of, m42, is, about, 17, mag, arcsec, 2, and, the, outer, bluish, glow, has, a, peak, surface, brightness, of, 21, 3, mag, arcsec, 2, the, orion, nebula, contains, a, very, young, open, cluster, known, as, the, trapezium, cluster, due, to, the, asterism, of, its, primary, four, stars, within, a, diameter, of, 1, 5, light, years, two, of, these, can, be, resolved, into, their, component, binary, systems, on, nights, with, good, seeing, giving, a, total, of, six, stars, the, stars, of, the, trapezium, cluster, along, with, many, other, stars, are, still, in, their, early, years, the, trapezium, cluster, is, a, component, of, the, much, larger, orion, nebula, cluster, an, association, of, about, 2, 800, stars, within, a, diameter, of, 20, light, years, the, orion, nebula, is, in, turn, surrounded, by, the, much, larger, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, which, is, hundreds, of, light, years, across, spanning, the, whole, orion, constellation, two, million, years, ago, the, orion, nebula, cluster, may, have, been, the, home, of, the, runaway, stars, ae, aurigae, 53, arietis, and, mu, columbae, which, are, currently, moving, away, from, the, nebula, at, speeds, greater, than, 100, km, s, 62, mi, s, observers, have, long, noted, a, distinctive, greenish, tint, to, the, nebula, in, addition, to, regions, of, red, and, of, blue, violet, the, red, hue, is, a, result, of, the, h, recombination, line, radiation, at, a, wavelength, of, 656, 3, nm, the, blue, violet, coloration, is, the, reflected, radiation, from, the, massive, o, class, stars, at, the, core, of, the, nebula, the, green, hue, was, a, puzzle, for, astronomers, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, because, none, of, the, known, spectral, lines, at, that, time, could, explain, it, there, was, some, speculation, that, the, lines, were, caused, by, a, new, element, and, the, name, nebulium, was, coined, for, this, mysterious, material, with, better, understanding, of, atomic, physics, however, it, was, later, determined, that, the, green, spectrum, was, caused, by, a, low, probability, electron, transition, in, doubly, ionized, oxygen, a, so, called, forbidden, transition, this, radiation, was, impossible, to, reproduce, in, the, laboratory, at, the, time, because, it, depended, on, the, quiescent, and, nearly, collision, free, environment, found, in, the, high, vacuum, of, deep, space, there, has, been, speculation, that, the, mayans, of, central, america, may, have, described, the, nebula, within, their, three, hearthstones, creation, myth, if, so, the, three, would, correspond, to, two, stars, at, the, base, of, orion, rigel, and, saiph, and, another, alnitak, at, the, tip, of, the, belt, of, the, imagined, hunter, the, vertices, of, a, nearly, perfect, equilateral, triangle, with, orion, s, sword, including, the, orion, nebula, in, the, middle, of, the, triangle, seen, as, the, smudge, of, smoke, from, copal, incense, in, a, modern, myth, or, in, the, translation, it, suggests, of, an, ancient, one, the, literal, or, figurative, embers, of, a, fiery, creation, neither, ptolemy, s, almagest, nor, al, sufi, s, book, of, fixed, stars, noted, this, nebula, even, though, they, both, listed, patches, of, nebulosity, elsewhere, in, the, night, sky, nor, did, galileo, mention, it, even, though, he, also, made, telescopic, observations, surrounding, it, in, 1610, and, 1617, this, has, led, to, some, speculation, that, a, flare, up, of, the, illuminating, stars, may, have, increased, the, brightness, of, the, nebula, the, first, discovery, of, the, diffuse, nebulous, nature, of, the, orion, nebula, is, generally, credited, to, french, astronomer, nicolas, claude, fabri, de, peiresc, on, november, 26, 1610, when, he, made, a, record, of, observing, it, with, a, refracting, telescope, purchased, by, his, patron, guillaume, du, vair, the, first, published, observation, of, the, nebula, was, by, the, jesuit, mathematician, and, astronomer, johann, baptist, cysat, of, lucerne, in, his, 1619, monograph, on, the, comets, describing, observations, of, the, nebula, that, may, date, back, to, 1611, he, made, comparisons, between, it, and, a, bright, comet, seen, in, 1618, and, described, how, the, nebula, appeared, through, his, telescope, as, one, sees, how, in, like, manner, some, stars, are, compressed, into, a, very, narrow, space, and, how, round, about, and, between, the, stars, a, white, light, like, that, of, a, white, cloud, is, poured, out, his, description, of, the, center, stars, as, different, from, a, comet, s, head, in, that, they, were, a, rectangle, may, have, been, an, early, description, of, the, trapezium, cluster, the, first, detection, of, three, of, the, four, stars, of, this, cluster, is, credited, to, galileo, galilei, in, a, february, 4, 1617, the, nebula, was, independently, discovered, though, visible, to, the, naked, eye, by, several, other, prominent, astronomers, in, the, following, years, including, by, giovanni, battista, hodierna, whose, sketch, was, the, first, published, in, de, systemate, orbis, cometici, deque, admirandis, coeli, characteribus, in, 1659, dutch, scientist, christiaan, huygens, published, the, first, detailed, drawing, of, the, central, region, of, the, nebula, in, systema, saturnium, charles, messier, observed, the, nebula, on, march, 4, 1769, and, he, also, noted, three, of, the, stars, in, trapezium, messier, published, the, first, edition, of, his, catalog, of, deep, sky, objects, in, 1774, completed, in, 1771, as, the, orion, nebula, was, the, 42nd, object, in, his, list, it, became, identified, as, m42, in, 1865, english, amateur, astronomer, william, huggins, used, his, visual, spectroscopy, method, to, examine, the, nebula, showing, it, like, other, nebulae, he, had, examined, was, made, up, of, luminous, gas, on, september, 30, 1880, henry, draper, used, the, new, dry, plate, photographic, process, with, an, 11, inch, 28, cm, refracting, telescope, to, make, a, 51, minute, exposure, of, the, orion, nebula, the, first, instance, of, astrophotography, of, a, nebula, in, history, another, set, of, photographs, of, the, nebula, in, 1883, saw, a, breakthrough, in, astronomical, photography, when, amateur, astronomer, andrew, ainslie, common, used, the, dry, plate, process, to, record, several, images, in, exposures, up, to, 60, minutes, with, a, 36, inch, 91, cm, reflecting, telescope, that, he, constructed, in, the, backyard, of, his, home, in, ealing, west, london, these, images, for, the, first, time, showed, stars, and, nebula, detail, too, faint, to, be, seen, by, the, human, eye, in, 1902, vogel, and, eberhard, discovered, differing, velocities, within, the, nebula, and, by, 1914, astronomers, at, marseilles, had, used, the, interferometer, to, detect, rotation, and, irregular, motions, campbell, and, moore, confirmed, these, results, using, the, spectrograph, demonstrating, turbulence, within, the, nebula, in, 1931, robert, j, trumpler, noted, that, the, fainter, stars, near, the, trapezium, formed, a, cluster, and, he, was, the, first, to, name, them, the, trapezium, cluster, based, on, their, magnitudes, and, spectral, types, he, derived, a, distance, estimate, of, 1, 800, light, years, this, was, three, times, farther, than, the, commonly, accepted, distance, estimate, of, the, period, but, was, much, closer, to, the, modern, value, in, 1993, the, hubble, space, telescope, first, observed, the, orion, nebula, since, then, the, nebula, has, been, a, frequent, target, for, hst, studies, the, images, have, been, used, to, build, a, detailed, model, of, the, nebula, in, three, dimensions, protoplanetary, disks, have, been, observed, around, most, of, the, newly, formed, stars, in, the, nebula, and, the, destructive, effects, of, high, levels, of, ultraviolet, energy, from, the, most, massive, stars, have, been, studied, in, 2005, the, advanced, camera, for, surveys, instrument, of, the, hubble, space, telescope, finished, capturing, the, most, detailed, image, of, the, nebula, yet, taken, the, image, was, taken, through, 104, orbits, of, the, telescope, capturing, over, 3, 000, stars, down, to, the, 23rd, magnitude, including, infant, brown, dwarfs, and, possible, brown, dwarf, binary, stars, a, year, later, scientists, working, with, the, hst, announced, the, first, ever, masses, of, a, pair, of, eclipsing, binary, brown, dwarfs, 2mass, j05352184, 0546085, the, pair, are, located, in, the, orion, nebula, and, have, approximate, masses, of, 0, 054, m, and, 0, 034, m, respectively, with, an, orbital, period, of, 9, 8, days, surprisingly, the, more, massive, of, the, two, also, turned, out, to, be, the, less, luminous, in, october, 2023, astronomers, based, on, observations, of, the, orion, nebula, with, the, james, webb, space, telescope, reported, the, discovery, of, pairs, of, rogue, planets, similar, in, mass, to, the, planet, jupiter, and, called, jumbos, short, for, jupiter, mass, binary, objects, the, entirety, of, the, orion, nebula, extends, across, a, 1, region, of, the, sky, and, includes, neutral, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, associations, of, stars, ionized, volumes, of, gas, and, reflection, nebulae, the, nebula, is, part, of, a, much, larger, nebula, that, is, known, as, the, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, the, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, extends, throughout, the, constellation, of, orion, and, includes, barnard, s, loop, the, horsehead, nebula, m43, m78, and, the, flame, nebula, stars, are, forming, throughout, the, entire, cloud, complex, but, most, of, the, young, stars, are, concentrated, in, dense, clusters, like, the, one, illuminating, the, orion, nebula, the, current, astronomical, model, for, the, nebula, consists, of, an, ionized, h, ii, region, roughly, centered, on, theta, 1, orionis, c, which, lies, on, the, side, of, an, elongated, molecular, cloud, in, a, cavity, formed, by, the, massive, young, stars, theta, 1, orionis, c, emits, 3, 4, times, as, much, photoionizing, light, as, the, next, brightest, star, theta, 2, orionis, a, the, h, ii, region, has, a, temperature, ranging, up, to, 10, 000, k, but, this, temperature, falls, dramatically, near, the, edge, of, the, nebula, the, nebulous, emission, comes, primarily, from, photoionized, gas, on, the, back, surface, of, the, cavity, the, h, ii, region, is, surrounded, by, an, irregular, concave, bay, of, more, neutral, high, density, cloud, with, clumps, of, neutral, gas, lying, outside, the, bay, area, this, in, turn, lies, on, the, perimeter, of, the, orion, molecular, cloud, the, gas, in, the, molecular, cloud, displays, a, range, of, velocities, and, turbulence, particularly, around, the, core, region, relative, movements, are, up, to, 10, km, s, 22, 000, mi, h, with, local, variations, of, up, to, 50, km, s, and, possibly, more, observers, have, given, names, to, various, features, in, the, orion, nebula, the, dark, bay, that, extends, from, the, north, into, the, bright, region, is, known, as, sinus, magnus, also, called, the, fish, s, mouth, the, illuminated, regions, to, both, sides, are, called, the, wings, other, features, include, the, sword, the, thrust, and, the, sail, the, orion, nebula, is, an, example, of, a, stellar, nursery, where, new, stars, are, being, born, observations, of, the, nebula, have, revealed, approximately, 700, stars, in, various, stages, of, formation, within, the, nebula, in, 1979, observations, with, the, lallemand, electronic, camera, at, the, pic, du, midi, observatory, showed, six, unresolved, high, ionization, sources, near, the, trapezium, cluster, these, sources, were, interpreted, as, partly, ionized, globules, pigs, the, idea, was, that, these, objects, are, being, ionized, from, the, outside, by, m42, later, observations, with, the, very, large, array, showed, solar, system, sized, condensations, associated, with, these, sources, here, the, idea, appeared, that, these, objects, might, be, low, mass, stars, surrounded, by, an, evaporating, protostellar, accretion, disk, in, 1993, observations, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, have, yielded, the, major, confirmation, of, protoplanetary, disks, within, the, orion, nebula, which, have, been, dubbed, proplyds, hst, has, revealed, more, than, 150, of, these, within, the, nebula, and, they, are, considered, to, be, systems, in, the, earliest, stages, of, solar, system, formation, the, sheer, numbers, of, them, have, been, used, as, evidence, that, the, formation, of, planetary, systems, is, fairly, common, in, the, universe, stars, form, when, clumps, of, hydrogen, and, other, gases, in, an, h, ii, region, contract, under, their, own, gravity, as, the, gas, collapses, the, central, clump, grows, stronger, and, the, gas, heats, to, extreme, temperatures, by, converting, gravitational, potential, energy, to, thermal, energy, if, the, temperature, gets, high, enough, nuclear, fusion, will, ignite, and, form, a, protostar, the, protostar, is, born, when, it, begins, to, emit, enough, radiative, energy, to, balance, out, its, gravity, and, halt, gravitational, collapse, typically, a, cloud, of, material, remains, a, substantial, distance, from, the, star, before, the, fusion, reaction, ignites, this, remnant, cloud, is, the, protostar, s, protoplanetary, disk, where, planets, may, form, recent, infrared, observations, show, that, dust, grains, in, these, protoplanetary, disks, are, growing, beginning, on, the, path, towards, forming, planetesimals, once, the, protostar, enters, into, its, main, sequence, phase, it, is, classified, as, a, star, even, though, most, planetary, disks, can, form, planets, observations, show, that, intense, stellar, radiation, should, have, destroyed, any, proplyds, that, formed, near, the, trapezium, group, if, the, group, is, as, old, as, the, low, mass, stars, in, the, cluster, since, proplyds, are, found, very, close, to, the, trapezium, group, it, can, be, argued, that, those, stars, are, much, younger, than, the, rest, of, the, cluster, members, once, formed, the, stars, within, the, nebula, emit, a, stream, of, charged, particles, known, as, a, stellar, wind, massive, stars, and, young, stars, have, much, stronger, stellar, winds, than, the, sun, the, wind, forms, shock, waves, or, hydrodynamical, instabilities, when, it, encounters, the, gas, in, the, nebula, which, then, shapes, the, gas, clouds, the, shock, waves, from, stellar, wind, also, play, a, large, part, in, stellar, formation, by, compacting, the, gas, clouds, creating, density, inhomogeneities, that, lead, to, gravitational, collapse, of, the, cloud, there, are, three, different, kinds, of, shocks, in, the, orion, nebula, many, are, featured, in, herbig, haro, objects, the, dynamic, gas, motions, in, m42, are, complex, but, are, trending, out, through, the, opening, in, the, bay, and, toward, the, earth, the, large, neutral, area, behind, the, ionized, region, is, currently, contracting, under, its, own, gravity, there, are, also, supersonic, bullets, of, gas, piercing, the, hydrogen, clouds, of, the, orion, nebula, each, bullet, is, ten, times, the, diameter, of, pluto, s, orbit, and, tipped, with, iron, atoms, glowing, in, the, infrared, they, were, probably, formed, one, thousand, years, earlier, from, an, unknown, violent, event, interstellar, clouds, like, the, orion, nebula, are, found, throughout, galaxies, such, as, the, milky, way, they, begin, as, gravitationally, bound, blobs, of, cold, neutral, hydrogen, intermixed, with, traces, of, other, elements, the, cloud, can, contain, hundreds, of, thousands, of, solar, masses, and, extend, for, hundreds, of, light, years, the, tiny, force, of, gravity, that, could, compel, the, cloud, to, collapse, is, counterbalanced, by, the, very, faint, pressure, of, the, gas, in, the, cloud, whether, due, to, collisions, with, a, spiral, arm, or, through, the, shock, wave, emitted, from, supernovae, the, atoms, are, precipitated, into, heavier, molecules, and, the, result, is, a, molecular, cloud, this, presages, the, formation, of, stars, within, the, cloud, usually, thought, to, be, within, a, period, of, 10, 30, million, years, as, regions, pass, the, jeans, mass, and, the, destabilized, volumes, collapse, into, disks, the, disk, concentrates, at, the, core, to, form, a, star, which, may, be, surrounded, by, a, protoplanetary, disk, this, is, the, current, stage, of, evolution, of, the, nebula, with, additional, stars, still, forming, from, the, collapsing, molecular, cloud, the, youngest, and, brightest, stars, we, now, see, in, the, orion, nebula, are, thought, to, be, less, than, 300, 000, years, old, and, the, brightest, may, be, only, 10, 000, years, in, age, some, of, these, collapsing, stars, can, be, particularly, massive, and, can, emit, large, quantities, of, ionizing, ultraviolet, radiation, an, example, of, this, is, seen, with, the, trapezium, cluster, over, time, the, ultraviolet, light, from, the, massive, stars, at, the, center, of, the, nebula, will, push, away, the, surrounding, gas, and, dust, in, a, process, called, photo, evaporation, this, process, is, responsible, for, creating, the, interior, cavity, of, the, nebula, allowing, the, stars, at, the, core, to, be, viewed, from, earth, the, largest, of, these, stars, have, short, life, spans, and, will, evolve, to, become, supernovae, within, about, 100, 000, years, most, of, the, gas, and, dust, will, be, ejected, the, remains, will, form, a, young, open, cluster, a, cluster, of, bright, young, stars, surrounded, by, wispy, filaments, from, the, former, cloud
