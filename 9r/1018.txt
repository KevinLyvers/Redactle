in, physics, statistical, mechanics, is, a, mathematical, framework, that, applies, statistical, methods, and, probability, theory, to, large, assemblies, of, microscopic, entities, sometimes, called, statistical, physics, or, statistical, thermodynamics, its, applications, include, many, problems, in, the, fields, of, physics, biology, chemistry, neuroscience, computer, science, information, theory, and, sociology, its, main, purpose, is, to, clarify, the, properties, of, matter, in, aggregate, in, terms, of, physical, laws, governing, atomic, motion, statistical, mechanics, arose, out, of, the, development, of, classical, thermodynamics, a, field, for, which, it, was, successful, in, explaining, macroscopic, physical, properties, such, as, temperature, pressure, and, heat, capacity, in, terms, of, microscopic, parameters, that, fluctuate, about, average, values, and, are, characterized, by, probability, distributions, while, classical, thermodynamics, is, primarily, concerned, with, thermodynamic, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, has, been, applied, in, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, to, the, issues, of, microscopically, modeling, the, speed, of, irreversible, processes, that, are, driven, by, imbalances, examples, of, such, processes, include, chemical, reactions, and, flows, of, particles, and, heat, the, fluctuation, dissipation, theorem, is, the, basic, knowledge, obtained, from, applying, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, to, study, the, simplest, non, equilibrium, situation, of, a, steady, state, current, flow, in, a, system, of, many, particles, in, 1738, swiss, physicist, and, mathematician, daniel, bernoulli, published, hydrodynamica, which, laid, the, basis, for, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, in, this, work, bernoulli, posited, the, argument, still, used, to, this, day, that, gases, consist, of, great, numbers, of, molecules, moving, in, all, directions, that, their, impact, on, a, surface, causes, the, gas, pressure, that, we, feel, and, that, what, we, experience, as, heat, is, simply, the, kinetic, energy, of, their, motion, the, founding, of, the, field, of, statistical, mechanics, is, generally, credited, to, three, physicists, in, 1859, after, reading, a, paper, on, the, diffusion, of, molecules, by, rudolf, clausius, scottish, physicist, james, clerk, maxwell, formulated, the, maxwell, distribution, of, molecular, velocities, which, gave, the, proportion, of, molecules, having, a, certain, velocity, in, a, specific, range, this, was, the, first, ever, statistical, law, in, physics, maxwell, also, gave, the, first, mechanical, argument, that, molecular, collisions, entail, an, equalization, of, temperatures, and, hence, a, tendency, towards, equilibrium, five, years, later, in, 1864, ludwig, boltzmann, a, young, student, in, vienna, came, across, maxwell, s, paper, and, spent, much, of, his, life, developing, the, subject, further, statistical, mechanics, was, initiated, in, the, 1870s, with, the, work, of, boltzmann, much, of, which, was, collectively, published, in, his, 1896, lectures, on, gas, theory, boltzmann, s, original, papers, on, the, statistical, interpretation, of, thermodynamics, the, h, theorem, transport, theory, thermal, equilibrium, the, equation, of, state, of, gases, and, similar, subjects, occupy, about, 2, 000, pages, in, the, proceedings, of, the, vienna, academy, and, other, societies, boltzmann, introduced, the, concept, of, an, equilibrium, statistical, ensemble, and, also, investigated, for, the, first, time, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, with, his, h, theorem, the, term, statistical, mechanics, was, coined, by, the, american, mathematical, physicist, j, willard, gibbs, in, 1884, according, to, gibbs, the, term, statistical, in, the, context, of, mechanics, i, e, statistical, mechanics, was, first, used, by, the, scottish, physicist, james, clerk, maxwell, in, 1871, in, dealing, with, masses, of, matter, while, we, do, not, perceive, the, individual, molecules, we, are, compelled, to, adopt, what, i, have, described, as, the, statistical, method, of, calculation, and, to, abandon, the, strict, dynamical, method, in, which, we, follow, every, motion, by, the, calculus, probabilistic, mechanics, might, today, seem, a, more, appropriate, term, but, statistical, mechanics, is, firmly, entrenched, shortly, before, his, death, gibbs, published, in, 1902, elementary, principles, in, statistical, mechanics, a, book, which, formalized, statistical, mechanics, as, a, fully, general, approach, to, address, all, mechanical, systems, macroscopic, or, microscopic, gaseous, or, non, gaseous, gibbs, methods, were, initially, derived, in, the, framework, classical, mechanics, however, they, were, of, such, generality, that, they, were, found, to, adapt, easily, to, the, later, quantum, mechanics, and, still, form, the, foundation, of, statistical, mechanics, to, this, day, in, physics, two, types, of, mechanics, are, usually, examined, classical, mechanics, and, quantum, mechanics, for, both, types, of, mechanics, the, standard, mathematical, approach, is, to, consider, two, concepts, using, these, two, concepts, the, state, at, any, other, time, past, or, future, can, in, principle, be, calculated, there, is, however, a, disconnect, between, these, laws, and, everyday, life, experiences, as, we, do, not, find, it, necessary, nor, even, theoretically, possible, to, know, exactly, at, a, microscopic, level, the, simultaneous, positions, and, velocities, of, each, molecule, while, carrying, out, processes, at, the, human, scale, for, example, when, performing, a, chemical, reaction, statistical, mechanics, fills, this, disconnection, between, the, laws, of, mechanics, and, the, practical, experience, of, incomplete, knowledge, by, adding, some, uncertainty, about, which, state, the, system, is, in, whereas, ordinary, mechanics, only, considers, the, behaviour, of, a, single, state, statistical, mechanics, introduces, the, statistical, ensemble, which, is, a, large, collection, of, virtual, independent, copies, of, the, system, in, various, states, the, statistical, ensemble, is, a, probability, distribution, over, all, possible, states, of, the, system, in, classical, statistical, mechanics, the, ensemble, is, a, probability, distribution, over, phase, points, as, opposed, to, a, single, phase, point, in, ordinary, mechanics, usually, represented, as, a, distribution, in, a, phase, space, with, canonical, coordinate, axes, in, quantum, statistical, mechanics, the, ensemble, is, a, probability, distribution, over, pure, states, and, can, be, compactly, summarized, as, a, density, matrix, as, is, usual, for, probabilities, the, ensemble, can, be, interpreted, in, different, ways, these, two, meanings, are, equivalent, for, many, purposes, and, will, be, used, interchangeably, in, this, article, however, the, probability, is, interpreted, each, state, in, the, ensemble, evolves, over, time, according, to, the, equation, of, motion, thus, the, ensemble, itself, the, probability, distribution, over, states, also, evolves, as, the, virtual, systems, in, the, ensemble, continually, leave, one, state, and, enter, another, the, ensemble, evolution, is, given, by, the, liouville, equation, classical, mechanics, or, the, von, neumann, equation, quantum, mechanics, these, equations, are, simply, derived, by, the, application, of, the, mechanical, equation, of, motion, separately, to, each, virtual, system, contained, in, the, ensemble, with, the, probability, of, the, virtual, system, being, conserved, over, time, as, it, evolves, from, state, to, state, one, special, class, of, ensemble, is, those, ensembles, that, do, not, evolve, over, time, these, ensembles, are, known, as, equilibrium, ensembles, and, their, condition, is, known, as, statistical, equilibrium, statistical, equilibrium, occurs, if, for, each, state, in, the, ensemble, the, ensemble, also, contains, all, of, its, future, and, past, states, with, probabilities, equal, to, the, probability, of, being, in, that, state, by, contrast, mechanical, equilibrium, is, a, state, with, a, balance, of, forces, that, has, ceased, to, evolve, the, study, of, equilibrium, ensembles, of, isolated, systems, is, the, focus, of, statistical, thermodynamics, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, addresses, the, more, general, case, of, ensembles, that, change, over, time, and, or, ensembles, of, non, isolated, systems, the, primary, goal, of, statistical, thermodynamics, also, known, as, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, is, to, derive, the, classical, thermodynamics, of, materials, in, terms, of, the, properties, of, their, constituent, particles, and, the, interactions, between, them, in, other, words, statistical, thermodynamics, provides, a, connection, between, the, macroscopic, properties, of, materials, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, and, the, microscopic, behaviours, and, motions, occurring, inside, the, material, whereas, statistical, mechanics, proper, involves, dynamics, here, the, attention, is, focussed, on, statistical, equilibrium, steady, state, statistical, equilibrium, does, not, mean, that, the, particles, have, stopped, moving, mechanical, equilibrium, rather, only, that, the, ensemble, is, not, evolving, a, sufficient, but, not, necessary, condition, for, statistical, equilibrium, with, an, isolated, system, is, that, the, probability, distribution, is, a, function, only, of, conserved, properties, total, energy, total, particle, numbers, etc, there, are, many, different, equilibrium, ensembles, that, can, be, considered, and, only, some, of, them, correspond, to, thermodynamics, additional, postulates, are, necessary, to, motivate, why, the, ensemble, for, a, given, system, should, have, one, form, or, another, a, common, approach, found, in, many, textbooks, is, to, take, the, equal, a, priori, probability, postulate, this, postulate, states, that, the, equal, a, priori, probability, postulate, therefore, provides, a, motivation, for, the, microcanonical, ensemble, described, below, there, are, various, arguments, in, favour, of, the, equal, a, priori, probability, postulate, other, fundamental, postulates, for, statistical, mechanics, have, also, been, proposed, for, example, recent, studies, shows, that, the, theory, of, statistical, mechanics, can, be, built, without, the, equal, a, priori, probability, postulate, one, such, formalism, is, based, on, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, together, with, the, following, set, of, postulates, where, the, third, postulate, can, be, replaced, by, the, following, there, are, three, equilibrium, ensembles, with, a, simple, form, that, can, be, defined, for, any, isolated, system, bounded, inside, a, finite, volume, these, are, the, most, often, discussed, ensembles, in, statistical, thermodynamics, in, the, macroscopic, limit, defined, below, they, all, correspond, to, classical, thermodynamics, for, systems, containing, many, particles, the, thermodynamic, limit, all, three, of, the, ensembles, listed, above, tend, to, give, identical, behaviour, it, is, then, simply, a, matter, of, mathematical, convenience, which, ensemble, is, used, the, gibbs, theorem, about, equivalence, of, ensembles, was, developed, into, the, theory, of, concentration, of, measure, phenomenon, which, has, applications, in, many, areas, of, science, from, functional, analysis, to, methods, of, artificial, intelligence, and, big, data, technology, important, cases, where, the, thermodynamic, ensembles, do, not, give, identical, results, include, in, these, cases, the, correct, thermodynamic, ensemble, must, be, chosen, as, there, are, observable, differences, between, these, ensembles, not, just, in, the, size, of, fluctuations, but, also, in, average, quantities, such, as, the, distribution, of, particles, the, correct, ensemble, is, that, which, corresponds, to, the, way, the, system, has, been, prepared, and, characterized, in, other, words, the, ensemble, that, reflects, the, knowledge, about, that, system, once, the, characteristic, state, function, for, an, ensemble, has, been, calculated, for, a, given, system, that, system, is, solved, macroscopic, observables, can, be, extracted, from, the, characteristic, state, function, calculating, the, characteristic, state, function, of, a, thermodynamic, ensemble, is, not, necessarily, a, simple, task, however, since, it, involves, considering, every, possible, state, of, the, system, while, some, hypothetical, systems, have, been, exactly, solved, the, most, general, and, realistic, case, is, too, complex, for, an, exact, solution, various, approaches, exist, to, approximate, the, true, ensemble, and, allow, calculation, of, average, quantities, there, are, some, cases, which, allow, exact, solutions, although, some, problems, in, statistical, physics, can, be, solved, analytically, using, approximations, and, expansions, most, current, research, utilizes, the, large, processing, power, of, modern, computers, to, simulate, or, approximate, solutions, a, common, approach, to, statistical, problems, is, to, use, a, monte, carlo, simulation, to, yield, insight, into, the, properties, of, a, complex, system, monte, carlo, methods, are, important, in, computational, physics, physical, chemistry, and, related, fields, and, have, diverse, applications, including, medical, physics, where, they, are, used, to, model, radiation, transport, for, radiation, dosimetry, calculations, the, monte, carlo, method, examines, just, a, few, of, the, possible, states, of, the, system, with, the, states, chosen, randomly, with, a, fair, weight, as, long, as, these, states, form, a, representative, sample, of, the, whole, set, of, states, of, the, system, the, approximate, characteristic, function, is, obtained, as, more, and, more, random, samples, are, included, the, errors, are, reduced, to, an, arbitrarily, low, level, many, physical, phenomena, involve, quasi, thermodynamic, processes, out, of, equilibrium, for, example, all, of, these, processes, occur, over, time, with, characteristic, rates, these, rates, are, important, in, engineering, the, field, of, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, is, concerned, with, understanding, these, non, equilibrium, processes, at, the, microscopic, level, statistical, thermodynamics, can, only, be, used, to, calculate, the, final, result, after, the, external, imbalances, have, been, removed, and, the, ensemble, has, settled, back, down, to, equilibrium, in, principle, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, could, be, mathematically, exact, ensembles, for, an, isolated, system, evolve, over, time, according, to, deterministic, equations, such, as, liouville, s, equation, or, its, quantum, equivalent, the, von, neumann, equation, these, equations, are, the, result, of, applying, the, mechanical, equations, of, motion, independently, to, each, state, in, the, ensemble, these, ensemble, evolution, equations, inherit, much, of, the, complexity, of, the, underlying, mechanical, motion, and, so, exact, solutions, are, very, difficult, to, obtain, moreover, the, ensemble, evolution, equations, are, fully, reversible, and, do, not, destroy, information, the, ensemble, s, gibbs, entropy, is, preserved, in, order, to, make, headway, in, modelling, irreversible, processes, it, is, necessary, to, consider, additional, factors, besides, probability, and, reversible, mechanics, non, equilibrium, mechanics, is, therefore, an, active, area, of, theoretical, research, as, the, range, of, validity, of, these, additional, assumptions, continues, to, be, explored, a, few, approaches, are, described, in, the, following, subsections, one, approach, to, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, is, to, incorporate, stochastic, random, behaviour, into, the, system, stochastic, behaviour, destroys, information, contained, in, the, ensemble, while, this, is, technically, inaccurate, aside, from, hypothetical, situations, involving, black, holes, a, system, cannot, in, itself, cause, loss, of, information, the, randomness, is, added, to, reflect, that, information, of, interest, becomes, converted, over, time, into, subtle, correlations, within, the, system, or, to, correlations, between, the, system, and, environment, these, correlations, appear, as, chaotic, or, pseudorandom, influences, on, the, variables, of, interest, by, replacing, these, correlations, with, randomness, proper, the, calculations, can, be, made, much, easier, the, boltzmann, transport, equation, and, related, approaches, are, important, tools, in, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, due, to, their, extreme, simplicity, these, approximations, work, well, in, systems, where, the, interesting, information, is, immediately, after, just, one, collision, scrambled, up, into, subtle, correlations, which, essentially, restricts, them, to, rarefied, gases, the, boltzmann, transport, equation, has, been, found, to, be, very, useful, in, simulations, of, electron, transport, in, lightly, doped, semiconductors, in, transistors, where, the, electrons, are, indeed, analogous, to, a, rarefied, gas, another, important, class, of, non, equilibrium, statistical, mechanical, models, deals, with, systems, that, are, only, very, slightly, perturbed, from, equilibrium, with, very, small, perturbations, the, response, can, be, analysed, in, linear, response, theory, a, remarkable, result, as, formalized, by, the, fluctuation, dissipation, theorem, is, that, the, response, of, a, system, when, near, equilibrium, is, precisely, related, to, the, fluctuations, that, occur, when, the, system, is, in, total, equilibrium, essentially, a, system, that, is, slightly, away, from, equilibrium, whether, put, there, by, external, forces, or, by, fluctuations, relaxes, towards, equilibrium, in, the, same, way, since, the, system, cannot, tell, the, difference, or, know, how, it, came, to, be, away, from, equilibrium, 664, this, provides, an, indirect, avenue, for, obtaining, numbers, such, as, ohmic, conductivity, and, thermal, conductivity, by, extracting, results, from, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, since, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, is, mathematically, well, defined, and, in, some, cases, more, amenable, for, calculations, the, fluctuation, dissipation, connection, can, be, a, convenient, shortcut, for, calculations, in, near, equilibrium, statistical, mechanics, a, few, of, the, theoretical, tools, used, to, make, this, connection, include, an, advanced, approach, uses, a, combination, of, stochastic, methods, and, linear, response, theory, as, an, example, one, approach, to, compute, quantum, coherence, effects, weak, localization, conductance, fluctuations, in, the, conductance, of, an, electronic, system, is, the, use, of, the, green, kubo, relations, with, the, inclusion, of, stochastic, dephasing, by, interactions, between, various, electrons, by, use, of, the, keldysh, method, the, ensemble, formalism, can, be, used, to, analyze, general, mechanical, systems, with, uncertainty, in, knowledge, about, the, state, of, a, system, ensembles, are, also, used, in, statistical, physics, explains, and, quantitatively, describes, superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence, collective, phenomena, in, solids, and, plasma, and, the, structural, features, of, liquid, it, underlies, the, modern, astrophysics, in, solid, state, physics, statistical, physics, aids, the, study, of, liquid, crystals, phase, transitions, and, critical, phenomena, many, experimental, studies, of, matter, are, entirely, based, on, the, statistical, description, of, a, system, these, include, the, scattering, of, cold, neutrons, x, ray, visible, light, and, more, statistical, physics, also, plays, a, role, in, materials, science, nuclear, physics, astrophysics, chemistry, biology, and, medicine, e, g, study, of, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, analytical, and, computational, techniques, derived, from, statistical, physics, of, disordered, systems, can, be, extended, to, large, scale, problems, including, machine, learning, e, g, to, analyze, the, weight, space, of, deep, neural, networks, statistical, physics, is, thus, finding, applications, in, the, area, of, medical, diagnostics, quantum, statistical, mechanics, is, statistical, mechanics, applied, to, quantum, mechanical, systems, in, quantum, mechanics, a, statistical, ensemble, probability, distribution, over, possible, quantum, states, is, described, by, a, density, operator, s, which, is, a, non, negative, self, adjoint, trace, class, operator, of, trace, 1, on, the, hilbert, space, h, describing, the, quantum, system, this, can, be, shown, under, various, mathematical, formalisms, for, quantum, mechanics, one, such, formalism, is, provided, by, quantum, logic
