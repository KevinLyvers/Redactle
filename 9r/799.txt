a, spring, is, a, natural, exit, point, at, which, groundwater, emerges, from, the, aquifer, and, flows, onto, the, top, of, the, earth, s, crust, pedosphere, to, become, surface, water, it, is, a, component, of, the, hydrosphere, as, well, as, a, part, of, the, water, cycle, springs, have, long, been, important, for, humans, as, a, source, of, fresh, water, especially, in, arid, regions, which, have, relatively, little, annual, rainfall, springs, are, driven, out, onto, the, surface, by, various, natural, forces, such, as, gravity, and, hydrostatic, pressure, a, spring, produced, by, the, emergence, of, geothermally, heated, groundwater, is, known, as, a, hot, spring, the, yield, of, spring, water, varies, widely, from, a, volumetric, flow, rate, of, nearly, zero, to, more, than, 14, 000, litres, per, second, 490, cu, ft, s, for, the, biggest, springs, springs, are, formed, when, groundwater, flows, onto, the, surface, this, typically, happens, when, the, water, table, reaches, above, the, surface, level, or, if, the, terrain, depresses, sharply, springs, may, also, be, formed, as, a, result, of, karst, topography, aquifers, or, volcanic, activity, springs, have, also, been, observed, on, the, ocean, floor, spewing, warmer, low, salinity, water, directly, into, the, ocean, springs, formed, as, a, result, of, karst, topography, create, karst, springs, in, which, ground, water, travels, through, a, network, of, cracks, and, fissures, openings, ranging, from, intergranular, spaces, to, large, caves, later, emerging, in, a, spring, the, forcing, of, the, spring, to, the, surface, can, be, the, result, of, a, confined, aquifer, in, which, the, recharge, area, of, the, spring, water, table, rests, at, a, higher, elevation, than, that, of, the, outlet, spring, water, forced, to, the, surface, by, elevated, sources, are, artesian, wells, this, is, possible, even, if, the, outlet, is, in, the, form, of, a, 300, foot, deep, 91, m, cave, in, this, case, the, cave, is, used, like, a, hose, by, the, higher, elevated, recharge, area, of, groundwater, to, exit, through, the, lower, elevation, opening, non, artesian, springs, may, simply, flow, from, a, higher, elevation, through, the, earth, to, a, lower, elevation, and, exit, in, the, form, of, a, spring, using, the, ground, like, a, drainage, pipe, still, other, springs, are, the, result, of, pressure, from, an, underground, source, in, the, earth, in, the, form, of, volcanic, or, magma, activity, the, result, can, be, water, at, elevated, temperature, and, pressure, i, e, hot, springs, and, geysers, the, action, of, the, groundwater, continually, dissolves, permeable, bedrock, such, as, limestone, and, dolomite, creating, vast, cave, systems, spring, discharge, or, resurgence, is, determined, by, the, spring, s, recharge, basin, factors, that, affect, the, recharge, include, the, size, of, the, area, in, which, groundwater, is, captured, the, amount, of, precipitation, the, size, of, capture, points, and, the, size, of, the, spring, outlet, water, may, leak, into, the, underground, system, from, many, sources, including, permeable, earth, sinkholes, and, losing, streams, in, some, cases, entire, creeks, seemingly, disappear, as, the, water, sinks, into, the, ground, via, the, stream, bed, grand, gulf, state, park, in, missouri, is, an, example, of, an, entire, creek, vanishing, into, the, groundwater, system, the, water, emerges, 9, miles, 14, km, away, forming, some, of, the, discharge, of, mammoth, spring, in, arkansas, human, activity, may, also, affect, a, spring, s, discharge, withdrawal, of, groundwater, reduces, the, water, pressure, in, an, aquifer, decreasing, the, volume, of, flow, springs, fall, into, three, general, classifications, perennial, springs, that, flow, constantly, during, the, year, intermittent, temporary, springs, that, are, active, after, rainfall, or, during, certain, seasonal, changes, and, periodic, as, in, geysers, that, vent, and, erupt, at, regular, or, irregular, intervals, springs, are, often, classified, by, the, volume, of, the, water, they, discharge, the, largest, springs, are, called, first, magnitude, defined, as, springs, that, discharge, water, at, a, rate, of, at, least, 2800, liters, or, 100, cubic, feet, 2, 8, m, 3, of, water, per, second, some, locations, contain, many, first, magnitude, springs, such, as, florida, where, there, are, at, least, 27, known, to, be, that, size, the, missouri, and, arkansas, ozarks, which, contain, 10, known, of, first, magnitude, and, 11, more, in, the, thousand, springs, area, along, the, snake, river, in, idaho, the, scale, for, spring, flow, is, as, follows, minerals, become, dissolved, in, the, water, as, it, moves, through, the, underground, rocks, this, mineral, content, is, measured, as, total, dissolved, solids, tds, this, may, give, the, water, flavor, and, even, carbon, dioxide, bubbles, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, geology, through, which, it, passes, this, is, why, spring, water, is, often, bottled, and, sold, as, mineral, water, although, the, term, is, often, the, subject, of, deceptive, advertising, mineral, water, contains, no, less, than, 250, parts, per, million, ppm, of, tds, springs, that, contain, significant, amounts, of, minerals, are, sometimes, called, mineral, springs, springs, without, such, mineral, content, meanwhile, are, sometimes, distinguished, as, sweet, springs, springs, that, contain, large, amounts, of, dissolved, sodium, salts, mostly, sodium, carbonate, are, called, soda, springs, many, resorts, have, developed, around, mineral, springs, and, are, known, as, spa, towns, mineral, springs, are, alleged, to, have, healing, properties, soaking, in, them, is, said, to, result, in, the, absorption, of, the, minerals, from, the, water, some, springs, contain, arsenic, levels, that, exceed, the, 10, ppb, world, health, organization, who, standard, for, drinking, water, where, such, springs, feed, rivers, they, can, also, raise, the, arsenic, levels, in, the, rivers, above, who, limits, water, from, springs, is, usually, clear, however, some, springs, may, be, colored, by, the, minerals, that, are, dissolved, in, the, water, for, instance, water, heavy, with, iron, or, tannins, will, have, an, orange, color, in, parts, of, the, united, states, a, stream, carrying, the, outflow, of, a, spring, to, a, nearby, primary, stream, may, be, called, a, spring, branch, spring, creek, or, run, groundwater, tends, to, maintain, a, relatively, long, term, average, temperature, of, its, aquifer, so, flow, from, a, spring, may, be, cooler, than, other, sources, on, a, summer, day, but, remain, unfrozen, in, the, winter, the, cool, water, of, a, spring, and, its, branch, may, harbor, species, such, as, certain, trout, that, are, otherwise, ill, suited, to, a, warmer, local, climate, springs, have, been, used, for, a, variety, of, human, needs, including, drinking, water, domestic, water, supply, irrigation, mills, navigation, and, electricity, generation, modern, uses, include, recreational, activities, such, as, fishing, swimming, and, floating, therapy, water, for, livestock, fish, hatcheries, and, supply, for, bottled, mineral, water, or, bottled, spring, water, springs, have, taken, on, a, kind, of, mythic, quality, in, that, some, people, falsely, believe, that, springs, are, always, healthy, sources, of, drinking, water, they, may, or, may, not, be, one, must, take, a, comprehensive, water, quality, test, to, know, how, to, use, a, spring, appropriately, whether, for, a, mineral, bath, or, drinking, water, springs, that, are, managed, as, spas, will, already, have, such, a, test, springs, are, often, used, as, sources, for, bottled, water, when, purchasing, bottled, water, labeled, as, spring, water, one, can, often, find, the, water, test, for, that, spring, on, the, website, of, the, company, selling, it, springs, have, been, used, as, sources, of, water, for, gravity, fed, irrigation, of, crops, indigenous, people, of, the, american, southwest, built, spring, fed, acequias, that, directed, water, to, fields, through, canals, the, spanish, missionaries, later, used, this, method, a, sacred, spring, or, holy, well, is, a, small, body, of, water, emerging, from, underground, and, revered, in, some, religious, context, christian, and, or, pagan, and, or, other, the, lore, and, mythology, of, ancient, greece, was, replete, with, sacred, and, storied, springs, notably, the, corycian, pierian, and, castalian, springs, in, medieval, europe, pagan, sacred, sites, frequently, became, christianized, as, holy, wells, the, term, holy, well, is, commonly, employed, to, refer, to, any, water, source, of, limited, size, i, e, not, a, lake, or, river, but, including, pools, and, natural, springs, and, seeps, which, has, some, significance, in, local, folklore, this, can, take, the, form, of, a, particular, name, an, associated, legend, the, attribution, of, healing, qualities, to, the, water, through, the, numinous, presence, of, its, guardian, spirit, or, of, a, christian, saint, or, a, ceremony, or, ritual, centered, on, the, well, site, christian, legends, often, recount, how, the, action, of, a, saint, caused, a, spring, s, water, to, flow, a, familiar, theme, especially, in, the, hagiography, of, celtic, saints, the, geothermally, heated, groundwater, that, flows, from, thermal, springs, is, greater, than, human, body, temperature, usually, in, the, range, of, 45, 50, c, 113, 122, f, but, they, can, be, hotter, those, springs, with, water, cooler, than, body, temperature, but, warmer, than, air, temperature, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, warm, springs, hot, springs, or, geothermal, springs, have, been, used, for, balneotherapy, bathing, and, relaxation, for, thousands, of, years, because, of, the, folklore, surrounding, hot, springs, and, their, claimed, medical, value, some, have, become, tourist, destinations, and, locations, of, physical, rehabilitation, centers, hot, springs, have, been, used, as, a, heat, source, for, thousands, of, years, in, the, 20th, century, they, became, a, renewable, resource, of, geothermal, energy, for, heating, homes, and, buildings, the, city, of, beppu, japan, contains, 2, 217, hot, spring, well, heads, that, provide, the, city, with, hot, water, hot, springs, have, also, been, used, as, a, source, of, sustainable, energy, for, greenhouse, cultivation, and, the, growing, of, crops, and, flowers, springs, have, been, represented, in, culture, through, art, mythology, and, folklore, throughout, history, the, fountain, of, youth, is, a, mythical, spring, which, was, said, to, restore, youth, to, anyone, who, drank, from, it, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, fountain, is, located, in, st, augustine, florida, and, was, discovered, by, juan, ponce, de, le, n, in, 1513, though, it, has, not, demonstrated, the, power, to, restore, youth, and, most, historians, dispute, the, veracity, of, ponce, de, le, n, s, discovery, pythia, also, known, as, the, oracle, at, delphi, was, the, high, priestess, of, the, temple, of, apollo, she, delivered, prophesies, in, a, frenzied, state, of, divine, possession, that, were, induced, by, vapours, rising, from, a, chasm, in, the, rock, it, is, believed, that, the, vapors, were, emitted, from, the, kerna, spring, at, delphi, the, greek, myth, of, narcissus, describes, a, young, man, who, fell, in, love, with, his, reflection, in, the, still, pool, of, a, spring, narcissus, gazed, into, an, unmuddied, spring, silvery, from, its, glittering, waters, which, neither, shepherds, nor, she, goats, grazing, on, the, mountain, nor, any, other, cattle, had, touched, which, neither, bird, nor, beast, nor, branch, fallen, from, a, tree, had, disturbed, ovid, the, early, 20th, century, american, photographer, james, reuel, smith, created, a, comprehensive, series, of, photographs, documenting, the, historical, springs, of, new, york, city, before, they, were, capped, by, the, city, after, the, advent, of, the, municipal, water, system, smith, later, photographed, springs, in, europe, leading, to, his, book, springs, and, wells, in, greek, and, roman, literature, their, legends, and, locations, 1922, the, 19th, century, japanese, artists, utagawa, hiroshige, and, utagawa, toyokuni, iii, created, a, series, of, wood, block, prints, two, artists, tour, the, seven, hot, springs, s, hitsu, shichit, meguri, in, 1854, the, chinese, city, jinan, is, known, as, a, city, of, springs, chinese, because, of, its, 72, spring, attractions, and, numerous, micro, spring, holes, spread, over, the, city, centre
