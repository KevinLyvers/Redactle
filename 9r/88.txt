the, solar, system, is, the, gravitationally, bound, system, of, the, sun, and, the, objects, that, orbit, it, it, was, formed, about, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, when, a, dense, region, of, a, molecular, cloud, collapsed, forming, the, sun, and, a, protoplanetary, disc, the, sun, is, a, typical, star, that, maintains, a, balanced, equilibrium, by, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, at, its, core, releasing, this, energy, from, its, outer, photosphere, astronomers, classify, it, as, a, g, type, main, sequence, star, the, largest, objects, that, orbit, the, sun, are, the, eight, planets, in, order, from, the, sun, they, are, four, terrestrial, planets, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, two, gas, giants, jupiter, and, saturn, and, two, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, all, terrestrial, planets, have, solid, surfaces, inversely, all, giant, planets, do, not, have, a, definite, surface, as, they, are, mainly, composed, of, gases, and, liquids, over, 99, 86, of, the, solar, system, s, mass, is, in, the, sun, and, nearly, 90, of, the, remaining, mass, is, in, jupiter, and, saturn, there, is, a, strong, consensus, among, astronomers, that, the, solar, system, has, at, least, nine, dwarf, planets, ceres, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, makemake, gonggong, eris, and, sedna, there, are, a, vast, number, of, small, solar, system, bodies, such, as, asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and, interplanetary, dust, clouds, some, of, these, bodies, are, in, the, asteroid, belt, between, mars, s, and, jupiter, s, orbit, and, the, kuiper, belt, just, outside, neptune, s, orbit, six, planets, seven, dwarf, planets, and, other, bodies, have, orbiting, natural, satellites, which, are, commonly, called, moons, the, solar, system, is, constantly, flooded, by, the, sun, s, charged, particles, the, solar, wind, forming, the, heliosphere, around, 75, 90, astronomical, units, from, the, sun, the, solar, wind, is, halted, resulting, in, the, heliopause, this, is, the, boundary, of, the, solar, system, to, interstellar, space, the, outermost, region, of, the, solar, system, is, the, theorized, oort, cloud, the, source, for, long, period, comets, extending, to, a, radius, of, 2, 000, 200, 000, au, the, closest, star, to, the, solar, system, proxima, centauri, is, 4, 25, light, years, 269, 000, au, away, both, stars, belong, to, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, solar, system, formed, at, least, 4, 568, billion, years, ago, from, the, gravitational, collapse, of, a, region, within, a, large, molecular, cloud, this, initial, cloud, was, likely, several, light, years, across, and, probably, birthed, several, stars, as, is, typical, of, molecular, clouds, this, one, consisted, mostly, of, hydrogen, with, some, helium, and, small, amounts, of, heavier, elements, fused, by, previous, generations, of, stars, as, the, pre, solar, nebula, collapsed, conservation, of, angular, momentum, caused, it, to, rotate, faster, the, center, where, most, of, the, mass, collected, became, increasingly, hotter, than, the, surroundings, as, the, contracting, nebula, spun, faster, it, began, to, flatten, into, a, protoplanetary, disc, with, a, diameter, of, roughly, 200, au, and, a, hot, dense, protostar, at, the, center, the, planets, formed, by, accretion, from, this, disc, in, which, dust, and, gas, gravitationally, attracted, each, other, coalescing, to, form, ever, larger, bodies, hundreds, of, protoplanets, may, have, existed, in, the, early, solar, system, but, they, either, merged, or, were, destroyed, or, ejected, leaving, the, planets, dwarf, planets, and, leftover, minor, bodies, due, to, their, higher, boiling, points, only, metals, and, silicates, could, exist, in, solid, form, in, the, warm, inner, solar, system, close, to, the, sun, within, the, frost, line, they, would, eventually, form, the, rocky, planets, of, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, because, these, refractory, materials, only, comprised, a, small, fraction, of, the, solar, nebula, the, terrestrial, planets, could, not, grow, very, large, the, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, formed, further, out, beyond, the, frost, line, the, point, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, where, material, is, cool, enough, for, volatile, icy, compounds, to, remain, solid, the, ices, that, formed, these, planets, were, more, plentiful, than, the, metals, and, silicates, that, formed, the, terrestrial, inner, planets, allowing, them, to, grow, massive, enough, to, capture, large, atmospheres, of, hydrogen, and, helium, the, lightest, and, most, abundant, elements, leftover, debris, that, never, became, planets, congregated, in, regions, such, as, the, asteroid, belt, kuiper, belt, and, oort, cloud, within, 50, million, years, the, pressure, and, density, of, hydrogen, in, the, center, of, the, protostar, became, great, enough, for, it, to, begin, thermonuclear, fusion, as, helium, accumulates, at, its, core, the, sun, is, growing, brighter, early, in, its, main, sequence, life, its, brightness, was, 70, that, of, what, it, is, today, the, temperature, reaction, rate, pressure, and, density, increased, until, hydrostatic, equilibrium, was, achieved, the, thermal, pressure, counterbalancing, the, force, of, gravity, at, this, point, the, sun, became, a, main, sequence, star, solar, wind, from, the, sun, created, the, heliosphere, and, swept, away, the, remaining, gas, and, dust, from, the, protoplanetary, disc, into, interstellar, space, following, the, dissipation, of, the, protoplanetary, disk, the, nice, model, proposes, that, gravitational, encounters, between, planetisimals, and, the, gas, giants, caused, each, to, migrate, into, different, orbits, this, led, to, dynamical, instability, of, the, entire, system, which, scattered, the, planetisimals, and, ultimately, placed, the, gas, giants, in, their, current, positions, during, this, period, the, grand, tack, hypothesis, suggests, that, a, final, inward, migration, of, jupiter, dispersed, much, of, the, asteroid, belt, leading, to, the, late, heavy, bombardment, of, the, inner, planets, the, solar, system, remains, in, a, relatively, stable, slowly, evolving, state, by, following, isolated, gravitationally, bound, orbits, around, the, sun, although, the, solar, system, has, been, fairly, stable, for, billions, of, years, it, is, technically, chaotic, and, may, eventually, be, disrupted, there, is, a, small, chance, that, another, star, will, pass, through, the, solar, system, in, the, next, few, billion, years, although, this, could, destabilize, the, system, and, eventually, lead, millions, of, years, later, to, expulsion, of, planets, collisions, of, planets, or, planets, hitting, the, sun, it, would, most, likely, leave, the, solar, system, much, as, it, is, today, the, sun, s, main, sequence, phase, from, beginning, to, end, will, last, about, 10, billion, years, for, the, sun, compared, to, around, two, billion, years, for, all, other, subsequent, phases, of, the, sun, s, pre, remnant, life, combined, the, solar, system, will, remain, roughly, as, it, is, known, today, until, the, hydrogen, in, the, core, of, the, sun, has, been, entirely, converted, to, helium, which, will, occur, roughly, 5, billion, years, from, now, this, will, mark, the, end, of, the, sun, s, main, sequence, life, at, that, time, the, core, of, the, sun, will, contract, with, hydrogen, fusion, occurring, along, a, shell, surrounding, the, inert, helium, and, the, energy, output, will, be, greater, than, at, present, the, outer, layers, of, the, sun, will, expand, to, roughly, 260, times, its, current, diameter, and, the, sun, will, become, a, red, giant, because, of, its, increased, surface, area, the, surface, of, the, sun, will, be, cooler, 2, 600, k, 4, 220, f, at, its, coolest, than, it, is, on, the, main, sequence, the, expanding, sun, is, expected, to, vaporize, mercury, as, well, as, venus, and, render, earth, uninhabitable, possibly, destroying, it, as, well, eventually, the, core, will, be, hot, enough, for, helium, fusion, the, sun, will, burn, helium, for, a, fraction, of, the, time, it, burned, hydrogen, in, the, core, the, sun, is, not, massive, enough, to, commence, the, fusion, of, heavier, elements, and, nuclear, reactions, in, the, core, will, dwindle, its, outer, layers, will, be, ejected, into, space, leaving, behind, a, dense, white, dwarf, half, the, original, mass, of, the, sun, but, only, the, size, of, earth, the, ejected, outer, layers, may, form, a, planetary, nebula, returning, some, of, the, material, that, formed, the, sun, but, now, enriched, with, heavier, elements, like, carbon, to, the, interstellar, medium, astronomers, sometimes, divide, the, solar, system, structure, into, separate, regions, the, inner, solar, system, includes, mercury, venus, earth, mars, and, the, bodies, in, the, asteroid, belt, the, outer, solar, system, includes, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune, and, the, bodies, in, the, kuiper, belt, since, the, discovery, of, the, kuiper, belt, the, outermost, parts, of, the, solar, system, are, considered, a, distinct, region, consisting, of, the, objects, beyond, neptune, the, principal, component, of, the, solar, system, is, the, sun, a, g, type, main, sequence, star, that, contains, 99, 86, of, the, system, s, known, mass, and, dominates, it, gravitationally, the, sun, s, four, largest, orbiting, bodies, the, giant, planets, account, for, 99, of, the, remaining, mass, with, jupiter, and, saturn, together, comprising, more, than, 90, the, remaining, objects, of, the, solar, system, including, the, four, terrestrial, planets, the, dwarf, planets, moons, asteroids, and, comets, together, comprise, less, than, 0, 002, of, the, solar, system, s, total, mass, the, sun, is, composed, of, roughly, 98, hydrogen, and, helium, as, are, jupiter, and, saturn, a, composition, gradient, exists, in, the, solar, system, created, by, heat, and, light, pressure, from, the, early, sun, those, objects, closer, to, the, sun, which, are, more, affected, by, heat, and, light, pressure, are, composed, of, elements, with, high, melting, points, objects, farther, from, the, sun, are, composed, largely, of, materials, with, lower, melting, points, the, boundary, in, the, solar, system, beyond, which, those, volatile, substances, could, coalesce, is, known, as, the, frost, line, and, it, lies, at, roughly, five, times, the, earth, s, distance, from, the, sun, the, planets, and, other, large, objects, in, orbit, around, the, sun, lie, near, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, known, as, the, ecliptic, smaller, icy, objects, such, as, comets, frequently, orbit, at, significantly, greater, angles, to, this, plane, most, of, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, have, secondary, systems, of, their, own, being, orbited, by, natural, satellites, called, moons, all, of, the, largest, natural, satellites, are, in, synchronous, rotation, with, one, face, permanently, turned, toward, their, parent, the, four, giant, planets, have, planetary, rings, thin, discs, of, tiny, particles, that, orbit, them, in, unison, as, a, result, of, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, planets, and, most, other, objects, orbit, the, sun, in, the, same, direction, that, the, sun, is, rotating, that, is, counter, clockwise, as, viewed, from, above, earth, s, north, pole, there, are, exceptions, such, as, halley, s, comet, most, of, the, larger, moons, orbit, their, planets, in, prograde, direction, matching, the, direction, of, planetary, rotation, neptune, s, moon, triton, is, the, largest, to, orbit, in, the, opposite, retrograde, manner, most, larger, objects, rotate, around, their, own, axes, in, the, prograde, direction, relative, to, their, orbit, though, the, rotation, of, venus, is, retrograde, to, a, good, first, approximation, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, describe, the, orbits, of, objects, around, the, sun, 433, 437, these, laws, stipulate, that, each, object, travels, along, an, ellipse, with, the, sun, at, one, focus, which, causes, the, body, s, distance, from, the, sun, to, vary, over, the, course, of, its, year, a, body, s, closest, approach, to, the, sun, is, called, its, perihelion, whereas, its, most, distant, point, from, the, sun, is, called, its, aphelion, 9, 6, with, the, exception, of, mercury, the, orbits, of, the, planets, are, nearly, circular, but, many, comets, asteroids, and, kuiper, belt, objects, follow, highly, elliptical, orbits, kepler, s, laws, only, account, for, the, influence, of, the, sun, s, gravity, upon, an, orbiting, body, not, the, gravitational, pulls, of, different, bodies, upon, each, other, on, a, human, time, scale, these, perturbations, can, be, accounted, for, using, numerical, models, 9, 6, but, the, planetary, system, can, change, chaotically, over, billions, of, years, the, angular, momentum, of, the, solar, system, is, a, measure, of, the, total, amount, of, orbital, and, rotational, momentum, possessed, by, all, its, moving, components, although, the, sun, dominates, the, system, by, mass, it, accounts, for, only, about, 2, of, the, angular, momentum, the, planets, dominated, by, jupiter, account, for, most, of, the, rest, of, the, angular, momentum, due, to, the, combination, of, their, mass, orbit, and, distance, from, the, sun, with, a, possibly, significant, contribution, from, comets, the, radius, of, the, sun, is, 0, 0047, au, 700, 000, km, 400, 000, mi, thus, the, sun, occupies, 0, 00001, 1, part, in, 10, 7, of, the, volume, of, a, sphere, with, a, radius, the, size, of, earth, s, orbit, whereas, earth, s, volume, is, roughly, 1, millionth, 10, 6, that, of, the, sun, jupiter, the, largest, planet, is, 5, 2, au, from, the, sun, and, has, a, radius, of, 71, 000, km, 0, 00047, au, 44, 000, mi, whereas, the, most, distant, planet, neptune, is, 30, au, from, the, sun, with, a, few, exceptions, the, farther, a, planet, or, belt, is, from, the, sun, the, larger, the, distance, between, its, orbit, and, the, orbit, of, the, next, nearest, object, to, the, sun, for, example, venus, is, approximately, 0, 33, au, farther, out, from, the, sun, than, mercury, whereas, saturn, is, 4, 3, au, out, from, jupiter, and, neptune, lies, 10, 5, au, out, from, uranus, attempts, have, been, made, to, determine, a, relationship, between, these, orbital, distances, like, the, titius, bode, law, and, johannes, kepler, s, model, based, on, the, platonic, solids, but, ongoing, discoveries, have, invalidated, these, hypotheses, some, solar, system, models, attempt, to, convey, the, relative, scales, involved, in, the, solar, system, in, human, terms, some, are, small, in, scale, and, may, be, mechanical, called, orreries, whereas, others, extend, across, cities, or, regional, areas, the, largest, such, scale, model, the, sweden, solar, system, uses, the, 110, meter, 361, foot, avicii, arena, in, stockholm, as, its, substitute, sun, and, following, the, scale, jupiter, is, a, 7, 5, meter, 25, foot, sphere, at, stockholm, arlanda, airport, 40, km, 25, mi, away, whereas, the, farthest, current, object, sedna, is, a, 10, cm, 4, in, sphere, in, lule, 912, km, 567, mi, away, if, the, sun, neptune, distance, is, scaled, to, 100, metres, 330, ft, then, the, sun, would, be, about, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, in, diameter, roughly, two, thirds, the, diameter, of, a, golf, ball, the, giant, planets, would, be, all, smaller, than, about, 3, mm, 0, 12, in, and, earth, s, diameter, along, with, that, of, the, other, terrestrial, planets, would, be, smaller, than, a, flea, 0, 3, mm, or, 0, 012, in, at, this, scale, besides, solar, energy, the, primary, characteristic, of, the, solar, system, enabling, the, presence, of, life, is, the, heliosphere, and, planetary, magnetic, fields, for, those, planets, that, have, them, these, magnetic, fields, partially, shield, the, solar, system, from, high, energy, interstellar, particles, called, cosmic, rays, the, density, of, cosmic, rays, in, the, interstellar, medium, and, the, strength, of, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, change, on, very, long, timescales, so, the, level, of, cosmic, ray, penetration, in, the, solar, system, varies, though, by, how, much, is, unknown, the, zone, of, habitability, of, the, solar, system, is, conventionally, located, in, the, inner, solar, system, where, planetary, surface, or, atmospheric, temperatures, admit, the, possibility, of, liquid, water, habitability, might, be, possible, in, subsurface, oceans, of, various, outer, solar, system, moons, compared, to, many, extrasolar, systems, the, solar, system, stands, out, in, lacking, planets, interior, to, the, orbit, of, mercury, the, known, solar, system, lacks, super, earths, planets, between, one, and, ten, times, as, massive, as, the, earth, although, the, hypothetical, planet, nine, if, it, does, exist, could, be, a, super, earth, orbiting, in, the, edge, of, the, solar, system, uncommonly, it, has, only, small, terrestrial, and, large, gas, giants, elsewhere, planets, of, intermediate, size, are, typical, both, rocky, and, gas, so, there, is, no, gap, as, seen, between, the, size, of, earth, and, of, neptune, with, a, radius, 3, 8, times, as, large, as, many, of, these, super, earths, are, closer, to, their, respective, stars, than, mercury, is, to, the, sun, a, hypothesis, has, arisen, that, all, planetary, systems, start, with, many, close, in, planets, and, that, typically, a, sequence, of, their, collisions, causes, consolidation, of, mass, into, few, larger, planets, but, in, case, of, the, solar, system, the, collisions, caused, their, destruction, and, ejection, the, orbits, of, solar, system, planets, are, nearly, circular, compared, to, many, other, systems, they, have, smaller, orbital, eccentricity, although, there, are, attempts, to, explain, it, partly, with, a, bias, in, the, radial, velocity, detection, method, and, partly, with, long, interactions, of, a, quite, high, number, of, planets, the, exact, causes, remain, undetermined, the, sun, is, the, solar, system, s, star, and, by, far, its, most, massive, component, its, large, mass, 332, 900, earth, masses, which, comprises, 99, 86, of, all, the, mass, in, the, solar, system, produces, temperatures, and, densities, in, its, core, high, enough, to, sustain, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, this, releases, an, enormous, amount, of, energy, mostly, radiated, into, space, as, electromagnetic, radiation, peaking, in, visible, light, because, the, sun, fuses, hydrogen, at, its, core, it, is, a, main, sequence, star, more, specifically, it, is, a, g2, type, main, sequence, star, where, the, type, designation, refers, to, its, effective, temperature, hotter, main, sequence, stars, are, more, luminous, but, shorter, lived, the, sun, s, temperature, is, intermediate, between, that, of, the, hottest, stars, and, that, of, the, coolest, stars, stars, brighter, and, hotter, than, the, sun, are, rare, whereas, substantially, dimmer, and, cooler, stars, known, as, red, dwarfs, make, up, about, 75, of, the, fusor, stars, in, the, milky, way, the, sun, is, a, population, i, star, having, formed, in, the, spiral, arms, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, it, has, a, higher, abundance, of, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, metals, in, astronomical, parlance, than, the, older, population, ii, stars, in, the, galactic, bulge, and, halo, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, were, formed, in, the, cores, of, ancient, and, exploding, stars, so, the, first, generation, of, stars, had, to, die, before, the, universe, could, be, enriched, with, these, atoms, the, oldest, stars, contain, few, metals, whereas, stars, born, later, have, more, this, higher, metallicity, is, thought, to, have, been, crucial, to, the, sun, s, development, of, a, planetary, system, because, the, planets, formed, from, the, accretion, of, metals, the, region, of, space, dominated, by, the, solar, magnetosphere, is, the, heliosphere, which, spans, much, of, the, solar, system, along, with, light, the, sun, radiates, a, continuous, stream, of, charged, particles, a, plasma, called, the, solar, wind, this, stream, spreads, outwards, at, speeds, from, 900, 000, kilometres, per, hour, 560, 000, mph, to, 2, 880, 000, kilometres, per, hour, 1, 790, 000, mph, filling, the, vacuum, between, the, bodies, of, the, solar, system, the, result, is, a, thin, dusty, atmosphere, called, the, interplanetary, medium, which, extends, to, at, least, 100, au, activity, on, the, sun, s, surface, such, as, solar, flares, and, coronal, mass, ejections, disturbs, the, heliosphere, creating, space, weather, and, causing, geomagnetic, storms, coronal, mass, ejections, and, similar, events, blow, a, magnetic, field, and, huge, quantities, of, material, from, the, surface, of, the, sun, the, interaction, of, this, magnetic, field, and, material, with, earth, s, magnetic, field, funnels, charged, particles, into, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, where, its, interactions, create, aurorae, seen, near, the, magnetic, poles, the, largest, stable, structure, within, the, heliosphere, is, the, heliospheric, current, sheet, a, spiral, form, created, by, the, actions, of, the, sun, s, rotating, magnetic, field, on, the, interplanetary, medium, the, inner, solar, system, is, the, region, comprising, the, terrestrial, planets, and, the, asteroids, composed, mainly, of, silicates, and, metals, the, objects, of, the, inner, solar, system, are, relatively, close, to, the, sun, the, radius, of, this, entire, region, is, less, than, the, distance, between, the, orbits, of, jupiter, and, saturn, this, region, is, within, the, frost, line, which, is, a, little, less, than, 5, au, from, the, sun, the, four, terrestrial, or, inner, planets, have, dense, rocky, compositions, few, or, no, moons, and, no, ring, systems, they, are, composed, largely, of, refractory, minerals, such, as, silicates, which, form, their, crusts, and, mantles, and, metals, such, as, iron, and, nickel, which, form, their, cores, three, of, the, four, inner, planets, venus, earth, and, mars, have, atmospheres, substantial, enough, to, generate, weather, all, have, impact, craters, and, tectonic, surface, features, such, as, rift, valleys, and, volcanoes, asteroids, except, for, the, largest, ceres, are, classified, as, small, solar, system, bodies, and, are, composed, mainly, of, carbonaceous, refractory, rocky, and, metallic, minerals, with, some, ice, they, range, from, a, few, meters, to, hundreds, of, kilometers, in, size, many, asteroids, are, divided, into, asteroid, groups, and, families, based, on, their, orbital, characteristics, some, asteroids, have, natural, satellites, that, orbit, them, that, is, asteroids, that, orbit, larger, asteroids, the, asteroid, belt, occupies, a, torus, shaped, region, between, 2, 3, and, 3, 3, au, from, the, sun, which, lies, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, it, is, thought, to, be, remnants, from, the, solar, system, s, formation, that, failed, to, coalesce, because, of, the, gravitational, interference, of, jupiter, the, asteroid, belt, contains, tens, of, thousands, possibly, millions, of, objects, over, one, kilometer, in, diameter, despite, this, the, total, mass, of, the, asteroid, belt, is, unlikely, to, be,

proportion, of, volatiles, such, as, water, ammonia, and, methane, than, those, of, the, inner, solar, system, because, the, lower, temperatures, allow, these, compounds, to, remain, solid, without,

low, melting, points, such, as, hydrogen, helium, and, neon, hence, their, designation, as, gas, giants, uranus, and, neptune, are, ice, giants, meaning, they, are, significantly, composed, of, ice, in, the, astronomical, sense, as, in, chemical, compounds, with, melting, points, of, up, to, a, few, hundred, kelvins, such, as, water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen, sulfide, and, carbon, dioxide, icy, substances, comprise, the, majority, of, the, satellites, of, the, giant, planets, and, small, objects, that, lie, beyond, neptune, s, orbit, the, centaurs, are, icy, comet, like, bodies, whose, semi, major, axes, are, greater, than, jupiter, s, and, less, than, neptune, s, between, 5, 5, and, 30, au, these, are, former, kuiper, belt, and, scattered, disc, objects, sdos, that, were, gravitationally, perturbed, closer, to, the, sun, by, the, outer, planets, and, are, expected, to, become, comets, or, get, ejected, out, of, the, solar, system, while, most, centaurs, are, inactive, and, asteroid, like, some, exhibit, clear, cometary, activity, such, as, the, first, centaur, discovered, 2060, chiron, which, has, been, classified, as, a, comet, 95p, because, it, develops, a, coma, just, as, comets, do, when, they, approach, the, sun, the, largest, known, centaur, 10199, chariklo, has, a, diameter, of, about, 250, km, 160, mi, and, is, one, of, the, only, few, minor, planets, known, to, possess, a, ring, system, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, lies, the, area, of, the, trans, neptunian, region, with, the, doughnut, shaped, kuiper, belt, home, of, pluto, and, several, other, dwarf, planets, and, an, overlapping, disc, of, scattered, objects, which, is, tilted, toward, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, and, reaches, much, further, out, than, the, kuiper, belt, the, entire, region, is, still, largely, unexplored, it, appears, to, consist, overwhelmingly, of, many, thousands, of, small, worlds, the, largest, having, a, diameter, only, a, fifth, that, of, earth, and, a, mass, far, smaller, than, that, of, the, moon, composed, mainly, of, rock, and, ice, this, region, is, sometimes, described, as, the, third, zone, of, the, solar, system, enclosing, the, inner, and, the, outer, solar, system, the, kuiper, belt, is, a, great, ring, of, debris, similar, to, the, asteroid, belt, but, consisting, mainly, of, objects, composed, primarily, of, ice, it, extends, between, 30, and, 50, au, from, the, sun, it, is, composed, mainly, of, small, solar, system, bodies, although, the, largest, few, are, probably, large, enough, to, be, dwarf, planets, there, are, estimated, to, be, over, 100, 000, kuiper, belt, objects, with, a, diameter, greater, than, 50, km, 30, mi, but, the, total, mass, of, the, kuiper, belt, is, thought, to, be, only, a, tenth, or, even, a, hundredth, the, mass, of, earth, many, kuiper, belt, objects, have, satellites, and, most, have, orbits, that, are, substantially, inclined, 10, to, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, the, kuiper, belt, can, be, roughly, divided, into, the, classical, belt, and, the, resonant, trans, neptunian, objects, the, latter, have, orbits, whose, periods, are, in, a, simple, ratio, to, that, of, neptune, for, example, going, around, the, sun, twice, for, every, three, times, that, neptune, does, or, once, for, every, two, the, classical, belt, consists, of, objects, having, no, resonance, with, neptune, and, extends, from, roughly, 39, 4, to, 47, 7, au, members, of, the, classical, kuiper, belt, are, sometimes, called, cubewanos, after, the, first, of, their, kind, to, be, discovered, originally, designated, 1992, qb, 1, and, has, since, been, named, albion, they, are, still, in, near, primordial, low, eccentricity, orbits, currently, there, is, strong, consensus, among, astronomers, that, five, members, of, the, kuiper, belt, are, dwarf, planets, many, dwarf, planet, candidates, are, being, considered, pending, further, data, for, verification, the, scattered, disc, which, overlaps, the, kuiper, belt, but, extends, out, to, near, 500, au, is, thought, to, be, the, source, of, short, period, comets, scattered, disc, objects, are, believed, to, have, been, perturbed, into, erratic, orbits, by, the, gravitational, influence, of, neptune, s, early, outward, migration, most, scattered, disc, objects, have, perihelia, within, the, kuiper, belt, but, aphelia, far, beyond, it, some, more, than, 150, au, from, the, sun, sdos, orbits, can, be, inclined, up, to, 46, 8, from, the, ecliptic, plane, some, astronomers, consider, the, scattered, disc, to, be, merely, another, region, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, describe, scattered, disc, objects, as, scattered, kuiper, belt, objects, some, astronomers, classify, centaurs, as, inward, scattered, kuiper, belt, objects, along, with, the, outward, scattered, residents, of, the, scattered, disc, currently, there, is, strong, consensus, among, astronomers, that, two, of, the, bodies, in, the, scattered, disc, are, dwarf, planets, some, objects, in, the, solar, system, have, a, very, large, orbit, and, therefore, are, much, less, affected, by, the, known, giant, planets, than, other, minor, planet, populations, these, bodies, are, called, extreme, trans, neptunian, objects, or, etnos, for, short, generally, etnos, semi, major, axes, are, at, least, 150, 250, au, wide, for, example, 541132, lele, k, honua, orbits, the, sun, once, every, 32, 000, years, with, a, distance, of, 65, 2000, au, from, the, sun, this, population, is, divided, into, three, subgroups, by, astronomers, the, scattered, etnos, have, perihelia, around, 38, 45, au, and, an, exceptionally, high, eccentricity, of, more, than, 0, 85, as, with, the, regular, scattered, disc, objects, they, were, likely, formed, as, result, of, gravitational, scattering, by, neptune, and, still, interact, with, the, giant, planets, the, detached, etnos, with, perihelia, approximately, between, 40, 45, and, 50, 60, au, are, less, affected, by, neptune, than, the, scattered, etnos, but, are, still, relatively, close, to, neptune, the, sednoids, or, inner, oort, cloud, objects, with, perihelia, beyond, 50, 60, au, are, too, far, from, neptune, to, be, strongly, influenced, by, it, currently, there, is, one, etno, that, is, classified, as, a, dwarf, planet, the, sun, s, stellar, wind, bubble, the, heliosphere, a, region, of, space, dominated, by, the, sun, has, its, boundary, at, the, termination, shock, based, on, the, sun, s, peculiar, motion, relative, to, the, local, standard, of, rest, this, boundary, is, roughly, 80, 100, au, from, the, sun, upwind, of, the, interstellar, medium, and, roughly, 200, au, from, the, sun, downwind, here, the, solar, wind, collides, with, the, interstellar, medium, and, dramatically, slows, condenses, and, becomes, more, turbulent, forming, a, great, oval, structure, known, as, the, heliosheath, the, heliosheath, has, been, theorized, to, look, and, behave, very, much, like, a, comet, s, tail, extending, outward, for, a, further, 40, au, on, the, upwind, side, but, tailing, many, times, that, distance, downwind, to, possibly, several, thousands, of, au, evidence, from, the, cassini, and, interstellar, boundary, explorer, spacecraft, has, suggested, that, it, is, forced, into, a, bubble, shape, by, the, constraining, action, of, the, interstellar, magnetic, field, but, the, actual, shape, remains, unknown, the, shape, and, form, of, the, outer, edge, of, the, heliosphere, is, likely, affected, by, the, fluid, dynamics, of, interactions, with, the, interstellar, medium, as, well, as, solar, magnetic, fields, prevailing, to, the, south, e, g, it, is, bluntly, shaped, with, the, northern, hemisphere, extending, 9, au, farther, than, the, southern, hemisphere, the, heliopause, is, considered, the, beginning, of, the, interstellar, medium, beyond, the, heliopause, at, around, 230, au, lies, the, bow, shock, a, plasma, wake, left, by, the, sun, as, it, travels, through, the, milky, way, large, objects, outside, the, heliopause, remain, gravitationally, bound, to, the, sun, but, the, flow, of, matter, in, the, interstellar, medium, homogenizes, the, distribution, of, micro, scale, objects, comets, are, small, solar, system, bodies, typically, only, a, few, kilometers, across, composed, largely, of, volatile, ices, they, have, highly, eccentric, orbits, generally, a, perihelion, within, the, orbits, of, the, inner, planets, and, an, aphelion, far, beyond, pluto, when, a, comet, enters, the, inner, solar, system, its, proximity, to, the, sun, causes, its, icy, surface, to, sublimate, and, ionise, creating, a, coma, a, long, tail, of, gas, and, dust, often, visible, to, the, naked, eye, short, period, comets, have, orbits, lasting, less, than, two, hundred, years, long, period, comets, have, orbits, lasting, thousands, of, years, short, period, comets, are, thought, to, originate, in, the, kuiper, belt, whereas, long, period, comets, such, as, hale, bopp, are, thought, to, originate, in, the, oort, cloud, many, comet, groups, such, as, the, kreutz, sungrazers, formed, from, the, breakup, of, a, single, parent, some, comets, with, hyperbolic, orbits, may, originate, outside, the, solar, system, but, determining, their, precise, orbits, is, difficult, old, comets, whose, volatiles, have, mostly, been, driven, out, by, solar, warming, are, often, categorized, as, asteroids, solid, objects, smaller, than, one, meter, are, usually, called, meteoroids, and, micrometeoroids, grain, sized, with, the, exact, division, between, the, two, categories, being, debated, over, the, years, by, 2017, the, iau, designated, any, solid, object, having, a, diameter, between, 30, micrometers, and, 1, meter, as, meteoroids, and, depreciated, the, micrometeoroid, categorization, instead, terms, smaller, particles, simply, as, dust, particles, some, meteoroids, formed, via, disintegration, of, comets, and, asteroids, while, a, few, formed, via, impact, debris, ejected, from, planetary, bodies, most, meteoroids, are, made, of, silicates, and, heavier, metals, like, nickel, and, iron, when, passing, through, the, solar, system, comets, produce, a, trail, of, meteoroids, it, is, hypothesized, that, this, is, caused, either, by, vaporization, of, the, comet, s, material, or, by, simple, breakup, of, dormant, comets, when, crossing, an, atmosphere, these, meteoroids, will, produce, bright, streaks, in, the, sky, due, to, atmospheric, entry, called, meteors, if, a, stream, of, meteoroids, enter, the, atmosphere, on, parallel, trajectories, the, meteors, will, seemingly, radiate, from, a, point, in, the, sky, hence, the, phenomenon, s, name, meteor, shower, the, inner, solar, system, is, home, to, the, zodiacal, dust, cloud, which, is, visible, as, the, hazy, zodiacal, light, in, dark, unpolluted, skies, it, may, be, generated, by, collisions, within, the, asteroid, belt, brought, on, by, gravitational, interactions, with, the, planets, a, more, recent, proposed, origin, is, materials, from, planet, mars, the, outer, solar, system, hosts, a, cosmic, dust, cloud, it, extends, from, about, 10, au, to, about, 40, au, and, was, probably, created, by, collisions, within, the, kuiper, belt, much, of, the, solar, system, is, still, unknown, areas, beyond, thousands, of, au, away, are, still, virtually, unmapped, and, learning, about, this, region, of, space, is, difficult, study, in, this, region, depends, upon, inferences, from, those, few, objects, whose, orbits, happen, to, be, perturbed, such, that, they, fall, closer, to, the, sun, and, even, then, detecting, these, objects, has, often, been, possible, only, when, they, happened, to, become, bright, enough, to, register, as, comets, many, objects, may, yet, be, discovered, in, the, solar, system, s, uncharted, regions, the, oort, cloud, is, a, theorized, spherical, shell, of, up, to, a, trillion, icy, objects, that, is, thought, to, be, the, source, for, all, long, period, comets, no, direct, observation, of, the, oort, cloud, is, possible, with, present, imaging, technology, it, is, theorized, to, surround, the, solar, system, at, roughly, 50, 000, au, 0, 9, ly, from, the, sun, and, possibly, to, as, far, as, 100, 000, au, 1, 8, ly, the, oort, cloud, is, thought, to, be, composed, of, comets, that, were, ejected, from, the, inner, solar, system, by, gravitational, interactions, with, the, outer, planets, oort, cloud, objects, move, very, slowly, and, can, be, perturbed, by, infrequent, events, such, as, collisions, the, gravitational, effects, of, a, passing, star, or, the, galactic, tide, the, tidal, force, exerted, by, the, milky, way, as, of, the, 2020s, a, few, astronomers, have, hypothesized, that, planet, nine, a, planet, beyond, neptune, might, exist, based, on, statistical, variance, in, the, orbit, of, extreme, trans, neptunian, objects, their, closest, approaches, to, the, sun, are, mostly, clustered, around, one, sector, and, their, orbits, are, similarly, tilted, suggesting, that, a, large, planet, might, be, influencing, their, orbit, over, millions, of, years, however, some, astronomers, said, that, this, observation, might, be, credited, to, observational, biases, or, just, sheer, coincidence, the, sun, s, gravitational, field, is, estimated, to, dominate, the, gravitational, forces, of, surrounding, stars, out, to, about, two, light, years, 125, 000, au, lower, estimates, for, the, radius, of, the, oort, cloud, by, contrast, do, not, place, it, farther, than, 50, 000, au, most, of, the, mass, is, orbiting, in, the, region, between, 3, 000, and, 100, 000, au, the, furthest, known, objects, such, as, comet, west, have, aphelia, around, 70, 000, au, from, the, sun, the, sun, s, hill, sphere, with, respect, to, the, galactic, nucleus, the, effective, range, of, its, gravitational, influence, is, thought, to, extend, up, to, a, thousand, times, farther, and, encompasses, the, hypothetical, oort, cloud, it, was, calculated, by, g, a, chebotarev, to, be, 230, 000, au, within, 10, light, years, of, the, sun, there, are, relatively, few, stars, the, closest, being, the, triple, star, system, alpha, centauri, which, is, about, 4, 4, light, years, away, and, may, be, in, the, local, bubble, s, g, cloud, alpha, centauri, a, and, b, are, a, closely, tied, pair, of, sun, like, stars, whereas, the, closest, star, to, sun, the, small, red, dwarf, proxima, centauri, orbits, the, pair, at, a, distance, of, 0, 2, light, years, in, 2016, a, potentially, habitable, exoplanet, was, found, to, be, orbiting, proxima, centauri, called, proxima, centauri, b, the, closest, confirmed, exoplanet, to, the, sun, the, solar, system, is, surrounded, by, the, local, interstellar, cloud, although, it, is, not, clear, if, it, is, embedded, in, the, local, interstellar, cloud, or, if, it, lies, just, outside, the, cloud, s, edge, multiple, other, interstellar, clouds, exist, in, the, region, within, 300, light, years, of, the, sun, known, as, the, local, bubble, the, latter, feature, is, an, hourglass, shaped, cavity, or, superbubble, in, the, interstellar, medium, roughly, 300, light, years, across, the, bubble, is, suffused, with, high, temperature, plasma, suggesting, that, it, may, be, the, product, of, several, recent, supernovae, the, local, bubble, is, a, small, superbubble, compared, to, the, neighboring, wider, radcliffe, wave, and, split, linear, structures, formerly, gould, belt, each, of, which, are, some, thousands, of, light, years, in, length, all, these, structures, are, part, of, the, orion, arm, which, contains, most, of, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, that, are, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, groups, of, stars, form, together, in, star, clusters, before, dissolving, into, co, moving, associations, a, prominent, grouping, that, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, is, the, ursa, major, moving, group, which, is, around, 80, light, years, away, within, the, local, bubble, the, nearest, star, cluster, is, hyades, which, lies, at, the, edge, of, the, local, bubble, the, closest, star, forming, regions, are, the, corona, australis, molecular, cloud, the, rho, ophiuchi, cloud, complex, and, the, taurus, molecular, cloud, the, latter, lies, just, beyond, the, local, bubble, and, is, part, of, the, radcliffe, wave, stellar, flybys, that, pass, within, 0, 8, light, years, of, the, sun, occur, roughly, once, every, 100, 000, years, the, closest, well, measured, approach, was, scholz, s, star, which, approached, to, 50, 000, au, of, the, sun, some, 70, thousands, years, ago, likely, passing, through, the, outer, oort, cloud, there, is, a, 1, chance, every, billion, years, that, a, star, will, pass, within, 100, au, of, the, sun, potentially, disrupting, the, solar, system, the, solar, system, is, located, in, the, milky, way, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, with, a, diameter, of, about, 100, 000, light, years, containing, more, than, 100, billion, stars, the, sun, is, part, of, one, of, the, milky, way, s, outer, spiral, arms, known, as, the, orion, cygnus, arm, or, local, spur, it, is, a, member, of, the, thin, disk, population, of, stars, orbiting, close, to, the, galactic, plane, its, speed, around, the, center, of, the, milky, way, is, about, 220, km, s, so, that, it, completes, one, revolution, every, 240, million, years, this, revolution, is, known, as, the, solar, system, s, galactic, year, the, solar, apex, the, direction, of, the, sun, s, path, through, interstellar, space, is, near, the, constellation, hercules, in, the, direction, of, the, current, location, of, the, bright, star, vega, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, lies, at, an, angle, of, about, 60, to, the, galactic, plane, the, sun, follows, a, nearly, circular, orbit, around, the, galactic, center, where, the, supermassive, black, hole, sagittarius, a, resides, at, a, distance, of, 26, 660, light, years, orbiting, at, roughly, the, same, speed, as, that, of, the, spiral, arms, if, it, orbited, close, to, the, center, gravitational, tugs, from, nearby, stars, could, perturb, bodies, in, the, oort, cloud, and, send, many, comets, into, the, inner, solar, system, producing, collisions, with, potentially, catastrophic, implications, for, life, on, earth, in, this, scenario, the, intense, radiation, of, the, galactic, center, could, interfere, with, the, development, of, complex, life, the, solar, system, s, location, in, the, milky, way, is, a, factor, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, on, earth, spiral, arms, are, home, to, a, far, larger, concentration, of, supernovae, gravitational, instabilities, and, radiation, that, could, disrupt, the, solar, system, but, since, earth, stays, in, the, local, spur, and, therefore, does, not, pass, frequently, through, spiral, arms, this, has, given, earth, long, periods, of, stability, for, life, to, evolve, however, according, to, the, controversial, shiva, hypothesis, the, changing, position, of, the, solar, system, relative, to, other, parts, of, the, milky, way, could, explain, periodic, extinction, events, on, earth, humanity, s, knowledge, of, the, solar, system, has, grown, incrementally, over, the, centuries, up, to, the, late, middle, ages, renaissance, astronomers, from, europe, to, india, believed, earth, to, be, stationary, at, the, center, of, the, universe, and, categorically, different, from, the, divine, or, ethereal, objects, that, moved, through, the, sky, although, the, greek, philosopher, aristarchus, of, samos, had, speculated, on, a, heliocentric, reordering, of, the, cosmos, nicolaus, copernicus, was, the, first, person, known, to, have, developed, a, mathematically, predictive, heliocentric, system, heliocentrism, did, not, triumph, immediately, over, geocentrism, but, the, work, of, copernicus, had, its, champions, notably, johannes, kepler, using, a, heliocentric, model, that, improved, upon, copernicus, by, allowing, orbits, to, be, elliptical, and, the, precise, observational, data, of, tycho, brahe, kepler, produced, the, rudolphine, tables, which, enabled, accurate, computations, of, the, positions, of, the, then, known, planets, pierre, gassendi, used, them, to, predict, a, transit, of, mercury, in, 1631, and, jeremiah, horrocks, did, the, same, for, a, transit, of, venus, in, 1639, this, provided, a, strong, vindication, of, heliocentrism, and, kepler, s, elliptical, orbits, in, the, 17th, century, galileo, publicized, the, use, of, the, telescope, in, astronomy, he, and, simon, marius, independently, discovered, that, jupiter, had, four, satellites, in, orbit, around, it, christiaan, huygens, followed, on, from, these, observations, by, discovering, saturn, s, moon, titan, and, the, shape, of, the, rings, of, saturn, in, 1677, edmond, halley, observed, a, transit, of, mercury, across, the, sun, leading, him, to, realize, that, observations, of, the, solar, parallax, of, a, planet, more, ideally, using, the, transit, of, venus, could, be, used, to, trigonometrically, determine, the, distances, between, earth, venus, and, the, sun, halley, s, friend, isaac, newton, in, his, magisterial, principia, mathematica, of, 1687, demonstrated, that, celestial, bodies, are, not, quintessentially, different, from, earthly, ones, the, same, laws, of, motion, and, of, gravity, apply, on, earth, and, in, the, skies, 142, the, term, solar, system, entered, the, english, language, by, 1704, when, john, locke, used, it, to, refer, to, the, sun, planets, and, comets, in, 1705, halley, realized, that, repeated, sightings, of, a, comet, were, of, the, same, object, returning, regularly, once, every, 75, 76, years, this, was, the, first, evidence, that, anything, other, than, the, planets, repeatedly, orbited, the, sun, though, seneca, had, theorized, this, about, comets, in, the, 1st, century, careful, observations, of, the, 1769, transit, of, venus, allowed, astronomers, to, calculate, the, average, earth, sun, distance, as, 93, 726, 900, miles, 150, 838, 800, km, only, 0, 8, greater, than, the, modern, value, uranus, having, occasionally, been, observed, since, 1690, and, possibly, from, antiquity, was, recognized, to, be, a, planet, orbiting, beyond, saturn, by, 1783, in, 1838, friedrich, bessel, successfully, measured, a, stellar, parallax, an, apparent, shift, in, the, position, of, a, star, created, by, earth, s, motion, around, the, sun, providing, the, first, direct, experimental, proof, of, heliocentrism, neptune, was, identified, as, a, planet, some, years, later, in, 1846, thanks, to, its, gravitational, pull, causing, a, slight, but, detectable, variation, in, the, orbit, of, uranus, mercury, s, orbital, anomaly, observations, led, to, searches, for, vulcan, a, planet, interior, of, mercury, but, these, attempts, were, quashed, with, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, in, 1915, in, the, 20th, century, humans, began, their, space, exploration, around, the, solar, system, starting, with, placing, telescopes, in, space, since, the, 1960s, by, 1989, all, eight, planets, have, been, visited, by, space, probes, probes, have, returned, samples, from, comets, and, asteroids, as, well, as, flown, through, the, sun, s, corona, and, visited, two, dwarf, planets, pluto, and, ceres, to, save, on, fuel, some, space, missions, make, use, of, gravity, assist, maneuvers, such, as, the, two, voyager, probes, accelerating, when, flyby, planets, in, the, outer, solar, system, and, the, parker, solar, probe, decelerating, closer, towards, the, sun, after, flyby, with, venus, humans, have, landed, on, the, moon, during, the, apollo, program, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, will, return, to, the, moon, in, the, 2020s, with, the, artemis, program, discoveries, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, has, prompted, the, redefinition, of, the, term, planet, in, 2006, hence, the, demotion, of, pluto, to, a, dwarf, planet, and, further, interest, in, trans, neptunian, objects, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt,
