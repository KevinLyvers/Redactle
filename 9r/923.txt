in, electromagnetism, and, electronics, electromotive, force, also, electromotance, abbreviated, emf, denoted, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, is, an, energy, transfer, to, an, electric, circuit, per, unit, of, electric, charge, measured, in, volts, devices, called, electrical, transducers, provide, an, emf, by, converting, other, forms, of, energy, into, electrical, energy, other, electrical, equipment, also, produce, an, emf, such, as, batteries, which, convert, chemical, energy, and, generators, which, convert, mechanical, energy, this, energy, conversion, is, achieved, by, physical, forces, applying, physical, work, on, electric, charges, however, electromotive, force, itself, is, not, a, physical, force, and, iso, iec, standards, have, deprecated, the, term, in, favor, of, source, voltage, or, source, tension, instead, denoted, u, s, displaystyle, u, s, an, electronic, hydraulic, analogy, may, view, emf, as, the, mechanical, work, done, to, water, by, a, pump, which, results, in, a, pressure, difference, analogous, to, voltage, in, electromagnetic, induction, emf, can, be, defined, around, a, closed, loop, of, a, conductor, as, the, electromagnetic, work, that, would, be, done, on, an, elementary, electric, charge, such, as, an, electron, if, it, travels, once, around, the, loop, for, two, terminal, devices, modeled, as, a, th, venin, equivalent, circuit, an, equivalent, emf, can, be, measured, as, the, open, circuit, voltage, between, the, two, terminals, this, emf, can, drive, an, electric, current, if, an, external, circuit, is, attached, to, the, terminals, in, which, case, the, device, becomes, the, voltage, source, of, that, circuit, although, an, emf, gives, rise, to, a, voltage, and, can, be, measured, as, a, voltage, and, may, sometimes, informally, be, called, a, voltage, they, are, not, the, same, phenomenon, see, distinction, with, potential, difference, devices, that, can, provide, emf, include, electrochemical, cells, thermoelectric, devices, solar, cells, photodiodes, electrical, generators, inductors, transformers, and, even, van, de, graaff, generators, in, nature, emf, is, generated, when, magnetic, field, fluctuations, occur, through, a, surface, for, example, the, shifting, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, during, a, geomagnetic, storm, induces, currents, in, an, electrical, grid, as, the, lines, of, the, magnetic, field, are, shifted, about, and, cut, across, the, conductors, in, a, battery, the, charge, separation, that, gives, rise, to, a, potential, difference, voltage, between, the, terminals, is, accomplished, by, chemical, reactions, at, the, electrodes, that, convert, chemical, potential, energy, into, electromagnetic, potential, energy, a, voltaic, cell, can, be, thought, of, as, having, a, charge, pump, of, atomic, dimensions, at, each, electrode, that, is, a, chemical, source, of, emf, can, be, thought, of, as, a, kind, of, charge, pump, that, acts, to, move, positive, charges, from, a, point, of, low, potential, through, its, interior, to, a, point, of, high, potential, by, chemical, mechanical, or, other, means, the, source, of, emf, performs, work, d, w, textstyle, mathit, d, w, on, that, charge, to, move, it, to, the, high, potential, terminal, the, emf, e, textstyle, mathcal, e, of, the, source, is, defined, as, the, work, d, w, textstyle, mathit, d, w, done, per, charge, d, q, textstyle, dq, e, d, w, d, q, textstyle, mathcal, e, frac, mathit, d, w, mathit, d, q, in, an, electrical, generator, a, time, varying, magnetic, field, inside, the, generator, creates, an, electric, field, via, electromagnetic, induction, which, creates, a, potential, difference, between, the, generator, terminals, charge, separation, takes, place, within, the, generator, because, electrons, flow, away, from, one, terminal, toward, the, other, until, in, the, open, circuit, case, an, electric, field, is, developed, that, makes, further, charge, separation, impossible, the, emf, is, countered, by, the, electrical, voltage, due, to, charge, separation, if, a, load, is, attached, this, voltage, can, drive, a, current, the, general, principle, governing, the, emf, in, such, electrical, machines, is, faraday, s, law, of, induction, in, 1801, alessandro, volta, introduced, the, term, force, motrice, lectrique, to, describe, the, active, agent, of, a, battery, which, he, had, invented, around, 1798, this, is, called, the, electromotive, force, in, english, around, 1830, michael, faraday, established, that, chemical, reactions, at, each, of, two, electrode, electrolyte, interfaces, provide, the, seat, of, emf, for, the, voltaic, cell, that, is, these, reactions, drive, the, current, and, are, not, an, endless, source, of, energy, as, the, earlier, obsolete, theory, thought, in, the, open, circuit, case, charge, separation, continues, until, the, electrical, field, from, the, separated, charges, is, sufficient, to, arrest, the, reactions, years, earlier, alessandro, volta, who, had, measured, a, contact, potential, difference, at, the, metal, metal, electrode, electrode, interface, of, his, cells, held, the, incorrect, opinion, that, contact, alone, without, taking, into, account, a, chemical, reaction, was, the, origin, of, the, emf, electromotive, force, is, often, denoted, by, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, or, in, a, device, without, internal, resistance, if, an, electric, charge, q, displaystyle, q, passing, through, that, device, gains, an, energy, w, displaystyle, w, via, work, the, net, emf, for, that, device, is, the, energy, gained, per, unit, charge, w, q, textstyle, tfrac, w, q, like, other, measures, of, energy, per, charge, emf, uses, the, si, unit, volt, which, is, equivalent, to, a, joule, si, unit, of, energy, per, coulomb, si, unit, of, charge, electromotive, force, in, electrostatic, units, is, the, statvolt, in, the, centimeter, gram, second, system, of, units, equal, in, amount, to, an, erg, per, electrostatic, unit, of, charge, inside, a, source, of, emf, such, as, a, battery, that, is, open, circuited, a, charge, separation, occurs, between, the, negative, terminal, n, and, the, positive, terminal, p, this, leads, to, an, electrostatic, field, e, o, p, e, n, c, i, r, c, u, i, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, e, mathrm, open, circuit, that, points, from, p, to, n, whereas, the, emf, of, the, source, must, be, able, to, drive, current, from, n, to, p, when, connected, to, a, circuit, this, led, max, abraham, to, introduce, the, concept, of, a, nonelectrostatic, field, e, displaystyle, boldsymbol, e, that, exists, only, inside, the, source, of, emf, in, the, open, circuit, case, e, e, o, p, e, n, c, i, r, c, u, i, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, e, boldsymbol, e, mathrm, open, circuit, while, when, the, source, is, connected, to, a, circuit, the, electric, field, e, displaystyle, boldsymbol, e, inside, the, source, changes, but, e, displaystyle, boldsymbol, e, remains, essentially, the, same, in, the, open, circuit, case, the, conservative, electrostatic, field, created, by, separation, of, charge, exactly, cancels, the, forces, producing, the, emf,

charge, by, the, source, s, nonelectrostatic, field, e, displaystyle, boldsymbol, e, when, the, charge, moves, from, n, to, p, when, the, source, is, connected, to, a, load, its, emf, is, just, e, s,

a, time, varying, magnetic, flux, c, displaystyle, phi, c, and, a, displaystyle, boldsymbol, a, is, the, vector, potential, the, electrostatic, field, does, not, contribute, to, the, net, emf, around, a, circuit, because, the, electrostatic, portion, of, the, electric, field, is, conservative, i, e, the, work, done, against, the, field, around, a, closed, path, is, zero, see, kirchhoff, s, voltage, law, which, is, valid, as, long, as, the, circuit, elements, remain, at, rest, and, radiation, is, ignored, that, is, the, induced, emf, like, the, emf, of, a, battery, connected, to, a, load, is, not, a, voltage, in, the, sense, of, a, difference, in, the, electric, scalar, potential, if, the, loop, c, displaystyle, c, is, a, conductor, that, carries, current, i, displaystyle, i, in, the, direction, of, integration, around, the, loop, and, the, magnetic, flux, is, due, to, that, current, we, have, that, b, l, i, displaystyle, phi, b, li, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, self, inductance, of, the, loop, if, in, addition, the, loop, includes, a, coil, that, extends, from, point, 1, to, 2, such, that, the, magnetic, flux, is, largely, localized, to, that, region, it, is, customary, to, speak, of, that, region, as, an, inductor, and, to, consider, that, its, emf, is, localized, to, that, region, then, we, can, consider, a, different, loop, c, displaystyle, c, that, consists, of, the, coiled, conductor, from, 1, to, 2, and, an, imaginary, line, down, the, center, of, the, coil, from, 2, back, to, 1, the, magnetic, flux, and, emf, in, loop, c, displaystyle, c, is, essentially, the, same, as, that, in, loop, c, displaystyle, c, e, c, e, c, d, c, d, t, l, d, i, d, t, c, e, d, 1, 2, e, c, o, n, d, u, c, t, o, r, d, 1, 2, e, c, e, n, t, e, r, l, i, n, e, d,

associate, an, effective, voltage, drop, l, d, i, d, t, displaystyle, l, di, dt, with, an, inductor, even, though, our, basic, understanding, of, induced, emf, is, based, on, the, vector, potential, rather, than, the, scalar, potential, and, consider, it, as, a, load, element, in, kirchhoff, s, voltage, law, e, s, o, u, r, c, e, l, o, a, d, e, l, e, m, e, n, t, s, v, o, l, t, a, g, e, d, r, o, p,

multiplied, by, an, amount, of, charge, d, q, displaystyle, dq, the, emf, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, yields, a, thermodynamic, work, term, e, d, q, displaystyle, mathcal, e, dq, that, is, used, in, the, formalism, for, the, change, in, gibbs, energy, when, charge, is, passed, in, a, battery, where, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, gibbs, free, energy, s, displaystyle, s, is, the, entropy, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, system, volume, p, displaystyle, p, is, its, pressure, and, t, displaystyle, t, is, its, absolute, temperature, the, combination, e, q, displaystyle, mathcal, e, q, is, an, example, of, a, conjugate, pair, of, variables, at, constant, pressure, the, above, relationship, produces, a, maxwell, relation, that, links, the, change, in, open, cell, voltage, with, temperature, t, displaystyle, t, a, measurable, quantity, to, the, change, in, entropy, s, displaystyle, s, when, charge, is, passed, isothermally, and, isobarically, the, latter, is, closely, related, to, the, reaction, entropy, of, the, electrochemical, reaction, that, lends, the, battery, its, power, this, maxwell, relation, is, if, a, mole, of, ions, goes, into, solution, for, example, in, a, daniell, cell, as, discussed, below, the, charge, through, the, external, circuit, is, where, n, 0, displaystyle, n, 0, is, the, number, of, electrons, ion, and, f, 0, displaystyle, f, 0, is, the, faraday, constant, and, the, minus, sign, indicates, discharge, of, the, cell, assuming, constant, pressure, and, volume, the, thermodynamic, properties, of, the, cell, are, related, strictly, to, the, behavior, of, its, emf, by, where, h, displaystyle, delta, h, is, the, enthalpy, of, reaction, the, quantities, on, the, right, are, all, directly, measurable, assuming, constant, temperature, and, pressure, which, is, used, in, the, derivation, of, the, nernst, equation, although, an, electrical, potential, difference, voltage, is, sometimes, called, an, emf, they, are, formally, distinct, concepts, in, the, case, of, an, open, circuit, the, electric, charge, that, has, been, separated, by, the, mechanism, generating, the, emf, creates, an, electric, field, opposing, the, separation, mechanism, for, example, the, chemical, reaction, in, a, voltaic, cell, stops, when, the, opposing, electric, field, at, each, electrode, is, strong, enough, to, arrest, the, reactions, a, larger, opposing, field, can, reverse, the, reactions, in, what, are, called, reversible, cells, the, electric, charge, that, has, been, separated, creates, an, electric, potential, difference, that, can, in, many, cases, be, measured, with, a, voltmeter, between, the, terminals, of, the, device, when, not, connected, to, a, load, the, magnitude, of, the, emf, for, the, battery, or, other, source, is, the, value, of, this, open, circuit, voltage, when, the, battery, is, charging, or, discharging, the, emf, itself, cannot, be, measured, directly, using, the, external, voltage, because, some, voltage, is, lost, inside, the, source, it, can, however, be, inferred, from, a, measurement, of, the, current, i, displaystyle, i, and, potential, difference, v, displaystyle, v, provided, that, the, internal, resistance, r, displaystyle, r, already, has, been, measured, e, v, i, r, displaystyle, mathcal, e, v, ir, potential, difference, is, not, the, same, as, induced, emf, often, called, induced, voltage, the, potential, difference, difference, in, the, electric, scalar, potential, between, two, points, a, and, b, is, independent, of, the, path, we, take, from, a, to, b, if, a, voltmeter, always, measured, the, potential, difference, between, a, and, b, then, the, position, of, the, voltmeter, would, make, no, difference, however, it, is, quite, possible, for, the, measurement, by, a, voltmeter, between, points, a, and, b, to, depend, on, the, position, of, the, voltmeter, if, a, time, dependent, magnetic, field, is, present, for, example, consider, an, infinitely, long, solenoid, using, an, ac, current, to, generate, a, varying, flux, in, the, interior, of, the, solenoid, outside, the, solenoid, we, have, two, resistors, connected, in, a, ring, around, the, solenoid, the, resistor, on, the, left, is, 100, and, the, one, on, the, right, is, 200, they, are, connected, at, the, top, and, bottom, at, points, a, and, b, the, induced, voltage, by, faraday, s, law, is, v, displaystyle, v, so, the, current, i, v, 100, 200, displaystyle, i, v, 100, 200, therefore, the, voltage, across, the, 100, resistor, is, 100, i, displaystyle, 100, i, and, the, voltage, across, the, 200, resistor, is, 200, i, displaystyle, 200, i, yet, the, two, resistors, are, connected, on, both, ends, but, v, a, b, displaystyle, v, ab, measured, with, the, voltmeter, to, the, left, of, the, solenoid, is, not, the, same, as, v, a, b, displaystyle, v, ab, measured, with, the, voltmeter, to, the, right, of, the, solenoid, the, question, of, how, batteries, galvanic, cells, generate, an, emf, occupied, scientists, for, most, of, the, 19th, century, the, seat, of, the, electromotive, force, was, eventually, determined, in, 1889, by, walther, nernst, to, be, primarily, at, the, interfaces, between, the, electrodes, and, the, electrolyte, atoms, in, molecules, or, solids, are, held, together, by, chemical, bonding, which, stabilizes, the, molecule, or, solid, i, e, reduces, its, energy, when, molecules, or, solids, of, relatively, high, energy, are, brought, together, a, spontaneous, chemical, reaction, can, occur, that, rearranges, the, bonding, and, reduces, the, free, energy, of, the, system, in, batteries, coupled, half, reactions, often, involving, metals, and, their, ions, occur, in, tandem, with, a, gain, of, electrons, termed, reduction, by, one, conductive, electrode, and, loss, of, electrons, termed, oxidation, by, another, reduction, oxidation, or, redox, reactions, the, spontaneous, overall, reaction, can, only, occur, if, electrons, move, through, an, external, wire, between, the, electrodes, the, electrical, energy, given, off, is, the, free, energy, lost, by, the, chemical, reaction, system, as, an, example, a, daniell, cell, consists, of, a, zinc, anode, an, electron, collector, that, is, oxidized, as, it, dissolves, into, a, zinc, sulfate, solution, the, dissolving, zinc, leaving, behind, its, electrons, in, the, electrode, according, to, the, oxidation, reaction, s, solid, electrode, aq, aqueous, solution, the, zinc, sulfate, is, the, electrolyte, in, that, half, cell, it, is, a, solution, which, contains, zinc, cations, z, n, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, zn, 2, and, sulfate, anions, s, o, 4, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, so, 4, 2, with, charges, that, balance, to, zero, in, the, other, half, cell, the, copper, cations, in, a, copper, sulfate, electrolyte, move, to, the, copper, cathode, to, which, they, attach, themselves, as, they, adopt, electrons, from, the, copper, electrode, by, the, reduction, reaction, which, leaves, a, deficit, of, electrons, on, the, copper, cathode, the, difference, of, excess, electrons, on, the, anode, and, deficit, of, electrons, on, the, cathode, creates, an, electrical, potential, between, the, two, electrodes, a, detailed, discussion, of, the, microscopic, process, of, electron, transfer, between, an, electrode, and, the, ions, in, an, electrolyte, may, be, found, in, conway, the, electrical, energy, released, by, this, reaction, 213, kj, per, 65, 4, g, of, zinc, can, be, attributed, mostly, due, to, the, 207, kj, weaker, bonding, smaller, magnitude, of, the, cohesive, energy, of, zinc, which, has, filled, 3d, and, 4s, orbitals, compared, to, copper, which, has, an, unfilled, orbital, available, for, bonding, if, the, cathode, and, anode, are, connected, by, an, external, conductor, electrons, pass, through, that, external, circuit, light, bulb, in, figure, while, ions, pass, through, the, salt, bridge, to, maintain, charge, balance, until, the, anode, and, cathode, reach, electrical, equilibrium, of, zero, volts, as, chemical, equilibrium, is, reached, in, the, cell, in, the, process, the, zinc, anode, is, dissolved, while, the, copper, electrode, is, plated, with, copper, the, salt, bridge, has, to, close, the, electrical, circuit, while, preventing, the, copper, ions, from, moving, to, the, zinc, electrode, and, being, reduced, there, without, generating, an, external, current, it, is, not, made, of, salt, but, of, material, able, to, wick, cations, and, anions, a, dissociated, salt, into, the, solutions, the, flow, of, positively, charged, cations, along, the, bridge, is, equivalent, to, the, same, number, of, negative, charges, flowing, in, the, opposite, direction, if, the, light, bulb, is, removed, open, circuit, the, emf, between, the, electrodes, is, opposed, by, the, electric, field, due, to, the, charge, separation, and, the, reactions, stop, for, this, particular, cell, chemistry, at, 298, k, room, temperature, the, emf, e,

negative, by, contact, with, any, one, that, precedes, it, a, typical, symbolic, convention, in, a, schematic, of, this, circuit, would, have, a, long, electrode, 1, and, a, short, electrode, 2, to, indicate, that, electrode, 1, dominates, volta, s, law, about, opposing, electrode, emfs, implies, that, given, ten, electrodes, for, example, zinc, and, nine, other, materials, 45, unique, combinations, of, voltaic, cells, 10, 9, 2, can, be, created, the, electromotive, force, produced, by, primary, single, use, and, secondary, rechargeable, cells, is, usually, of, the, order, of, a, few, volts, the, figures, quoted, below, are, nominal, because, emf, varies, according, to, the, size, of, the, load, and, the, state, of, exhaustion, of, the, cell, other, chemical, sources, include, fuel, cells, electromagnetic, induction, is, the, production, of, a, circulating, electric, field, by, a, time, dependent, magnetic, field, a, time, dependent, magnetic, field, can, be, produced, either, by, motion, of, a, magnet, relative, to, a, circuit, by, motion, of, a, circuit, relative, to, another, circuit, at, least, one, of, these, must, be, carrying, an, electric, current, or, by, changing, the, electric, current, in, a, fixed, circuit, the, effect, on, the, circuit, itself, of, changing, the, electric, current, is, known, as, self, induction, the, effect, on, another, circuit, is, known, as, mutual, induction, for, a, given, circuit, the, electromagnetically, induced, emf, is, determined, purely, by, the, rate, of, change, of, the, magnetic, flux, through, the, circuit, according, to, faraday, s, law, of, induction, an, emf, is, induced, in, a, coil, or, conductor, whenever, there, is, change, in, the, flux, linkages, depending, on, the, way, in, which, the, changes, are, brought, about, there, are, two, types, when, the, conductor, is, moved, in, a, stationary, magnetic, field, to, procure, a, change, in, the, flux, linkage, the, emf, is, statically, induced, the, electromotive, force, generated, by, motion, is, often, referred, to, as, motional, emf, when, the, change, in, flux, linkage, arises, from, a, change, in, the, magnetic, field, around, the, stationary, conductor, the, emf, is, dynamically, induced, the, electromotive, force, generated, by, a, time, varying, magnetic, field, is, often, referred, to, as, transformer, emf, when, solids, of, two, different, materials, are, in, contact, thermodynamic, equilibrium, requires, that, one, of, the, solids, assume, a, higher, electrical, potential, than, the, other, this, is, called, the, contact, potential, dissimilar, metals, in, contact, produce, what, is, known, also, as, a, contact, electromotive, force, or, galvani, potential, the, magnitude, of, this, potential, difference, is, often, expressed, as, a, difference, in, fermi, levels, in, the, two, solids, when, they, are, at, charge, neutrality, where, the, fermi, level, a, name, for, the, chemical, potential, of, an, electron, system, describes, the, energy, necessary, to, remove, an, electron, from, the, body, to, some, common, point, such, as, ground, if, there, is, an, energy, advantage, in, taking, an, electron, from, one, body, to, the, other, such, a, transfer, will, occur, the, transfer, causes, a, charge, separation, with, one, body, gaining, electrons, and, the, other, losing, electrons, this, charge, transfer, causes, a, potential, difference, between, the, bodies, which, partly, cancels, the, potential, originating, from, the, contact, and, eventually, equilibrium, is, reached, at, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, fermi, levels, are, equal, the, electron, removal, energy, is, identical, and, there, is, now, a, built, in, electrostatic, potential, between, the, bodies, the, original, difference, in, fermi, levels, before, contact, is, referred, to, as, the, emf, the, contact, potential, cannot, drive, steady, current, through, a, load, attached, to, its, terminals, because, that, current, would, involve, a, charge, transfer, no, mechanism, exists, to, continue, such, transfer, and, hence, maintain, a, current, once, equilibrium, is, attained, one, might, inquire, why, the, contact, potential, does, not, appear, in, kirchhoff, s, law, of, voltages, as, one, contribution, to, the, sum, of, potential, drops, the, customary, answer, is, that, any, circuit, involves, not, only, a, particular, diode, or, junction, but, also, all, the, contact, potentials, due, to, wiring, and, so, forth, around, the, entire, circuit, the, sum, of, all, the, contact, potentials, is, zero, and, so, they, may, be, ignored, in, kirchhoff, s, law, operation, of, a, solar, cell, can, be, understood, from, its, equivalent, circuit, photons, with, energy, greater, than, the, bandgap, of, the, semiconductor, create, mobile, electron, hole, pairs, charge, separation, occurs, because, of, a, pre, existing, electric, field, associated, with, the, p, n, junction, this, electric, field, is, created, from, a, built, in, potential, which, arises, from, the, contact, potential, between, the, two, different, materials, in, the, junction, the, charge, separation, between, positive, holes, and, negative, electrons, across, the, p, n, diode, yields, a, forward, voltage, the, photo, voltage, between, the, illuminated, diode, terminals, which, drives, current, through, any, attached, load, photo, voltage, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, photo, emf, distinguishing, between, the, effect, and, the, cause, two, internal, current, losses, i, s, h, i, d, displaystyle, i, sh, i, d, limit, the, total, current, i, displaystyle, i, available, to, the, external, circuit, the, light, induced, charge, separation, eventually, creates, a, forward, current, i, s, h, displaystyle, i, sh, through, the, cell, s, internal, resistance, r, s, h, displaystyle, r, sh, in, the, direction, opposite, the, light, induced, current, i, l, displaystyle, i, l, in, addition, the, induced, voltage, tends, to, forward, bias, the, junction, which, at, high, enough, voltages, will, cause, a, recombination, current, i, d, displaystyle, i, d, in, the, diode, opposite, the, light, induced, current, when, the, output, is, short, circuited, the, output, voltage, is, zeroed, and, so, the, voltage, across, the, diode, is, smallest, thus, short, circuiting, results, in, the, smallest, i, s, h, i, d, displaystyle, i, sh, i, d, losses, and, consequently, the, maximum, output, current, which, for, a, high, quality, solar, cell, is, approximately, equal, to, the, light, induced, current, i, l, displaystyle, i, l, approximately, this, same, current, is, obtained, for, forward, voltages, up, to, the, point, where, the, diode, conduction, becomes, significant, the, current, delivered, by, the, illuminated, diode, to, the, external, circuit, can, be, simplified, based, on, certain, assumptions, to, i, 0, displaystyle, i, 0, is, the, reverse, saturation, current, two, parameters, that, depend, on, the, solar, cell, construction, and, to, some, degree, upon, the, voltage, itself, are, the, ideality, factor, m, and, the, thermal, voltage, v, t, k, t, q, displaystyle, v, mathrm, t, tfrac, kt, q, which, is, about, 26, millivolts, at, room, temperature, solving, the, illuminated, diode, s, above, simplified, current, voltage, relationship, for, output, voltage, yields, which, is, plotted, against, i, i, 0, displaystyle, i, i, 0, in, the, figure, the, solar, cell, s, photo, emf, e, p, h, o, t, o, displaystyle, mathcal, e, mathrm, photo, has, the, same, value, as, the, open, circuit, voltage, v, o, c, displaystyle, v, oc, which, is, determined, by, zeroing, the, output, current, i, displaystyle, i, it, has, a, logarithmic, dependence, on, the, light, induced, current, i, l, displaystyle, i, l, and, is, where, the, junction, s, forward, bias, voltage, is, just, enough, that, the, forward, current, completely, balances, the, light, induced, current, for, silicon, junctions, it, is, typically, not, much, more, than, 0, 5, volts, while, for, high, quality, silicon, panels, it, can, exceed, 0, 7, volts, in, direct, sunlight, when, driving, a, resistive, load, the, output, voltage, can, be, determined, using, ohm, s, law, and, will, lie, between, the, short, circuit, value, of, zero, volts, and, the, open, circuit, voltage, v, o, c, displaystyle, v, oc, when, that, resistance, is, small, enough, such, that, i, i, l, displaystyle, i, approx, i, l, the, near, vertical, part, of, the, two, illustrated, curves, the, solar, cell, acts, more, like, a, current, generator, rather, than, a, voltage, generator, since, the, current, drawn, is, nearly, fixed, over, a, range, of, output, voltages, this, contrasts, with, batteries, which, act, more, like, voltage, generators
