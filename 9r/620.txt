a, landform, is, a, natural, or, anthropogenic, land, feature, on, the, solid, surface, of, the, earth, or, other, planetary, body, landforms, together, make, up, a, given, terrain, and, their, arrangement, in, the, landscape, is, known, as, topography, landforms, include, hills, mountains, canyons, and, valleys, as, well, as, shoreline, features, such, as, bays, peninsulas, and, seas, including, submerged, features, such, as, mid, ocean, ridges, volcanoes, and, the, great, ocean, basins, landforms, are, categorized, by, characteristic, physical, attributes, such, as, elevation, slope, orientation, structure, stratification, rock, exposure, and, soil, type, gross, physical, features, or, landforms, include, intuitive, elements, such, as, berms, mounds, hills, ridges, cliffs, valleys, rivers, peninsulas, volcanoes, and, numerous, other, structural, and, size, scaled, e, g, ponds, vs, lakes, hills, vs, mountains, elements, including, various, kinds, of, inland, and, oceanic, waterbodies, and, sub, surface, features, mountains, hills, plateaux, and, plains, are, the, four, major, types, of, landforms, minor, landforms, include, buttes, canyons, valleys, and, basins, tectonic, plate, movement, under, the, earth, can, create, landforms, by, pushing, up, mountains, and, hills, oceans, and, continents, exemplify, the, highest, order, landforms, landform, elements, are, parts, of, a, high, order, landforms, that, can, be, further, identified, and, systematically, given, a, cohesive, definition, such, as, hill, tops, shoulders, saddles, foreslopes, and, backslopes, some, generic, landform, elements, including, pits, peaks, channels, ridges, passes, pools, and, plains, terrain, or, relief, is, the, third, or, vertical, dimension, of, land, surface, topography, is, the, study, of, terrain, although, the, word, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, relief, itself, when, relief, is, described, underwater, the, term, bathymetry, is, used, in, cartography, many, different, techniques, are, used, to, describe, relief, including, contour, lines, and, triangulated, irregular, networks, elementary, landforms, segments, facets, relief, units, are, the, smallest, homogeneous, divisions, of, the, land, surface, at, the, given, scale, resolution, these, are, areas, with, relatively, homogeneous, morphometric, properties, bounded, by, lines, of, discontinuity, a, plateau, or, a, hill, can, be, observed, at, various, scales, ranging, from, a, few, hundred, meters, to, hundreds, of, kilometers, hence, the, spatial, distribution, of, landforms, is, often, scale, dependent, as, is, the, case, for, soils, and, geological, strata, a, number, of, factors, ranging, from, plate, tectonics, to, erosion, and, deposition, also, due, to, human, activity, can, generate, and, affect, landforms, biological, factors, can, also, influence, landforms, for, example, note, the, role, of, vegetation, in, the, development, of, dune, systems, and, salt, marshes, and, the, work, of, corals, and, algae, in, the, formation, of, coral, reefs, landforms, do, not, include, several, man, made, features, such, as, canals, ports, and, many, harbors, and, geographic, features, such, as, deserts, forests, and, grasslands, many, of, the, terms, are, not, restricted, to, refer, to, features, of, the, planet, earth, and, can, be, used, to, describe, surface, features, of, other, planets, and, similar, objects, in, the, universe, examples, are, mountains, hills, polar, caps, and, valleys, which, are, found, on, all, of, the, terrestrial, planets, the, scientific, study, of, landforms, is, known, as, geomorphology, in, onomastic, terminology, toponyms, geographical, proper, names, of, individual, landform, objects, mountains, hills, valleys, etc, are, called, oronyms, landforms, may, be, extracted, from, a, digital, elevation, model, dem, using, some, automated, techniques, where, the, data, has, been, gathered, by, modern, satellites, and, stereoscopic, aerial, surveillance, cameras, until, recently, compiling, the, data, found, in, such, data, sets, required, time, consuming, and, expensive, techniques, involving, many, man, hours, the, most, detailed, dems, available, are, measured, directly, using, lidar, techniques, igstar, cxvellie, 2017, howard, jeffrey, ed, anthropogenic, landforms, and, soil, parent, materials, anthropogenic, soils, progress, in, soil, science, cham, springer, international, publishing, pp, 25, 51, doi, 10, 1007, 978, 3, 319, 54331, 4, 3, isbn, 978, 3, 319, 54331, 4, retrieved, 2022, 08, 12
