in, physics, a, redshift, is, an, increase, in, the, wavelength, and, corresponding, decrease, in, the, frequency, and, photon, energy, of, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, light, the, opposite, change, a, decrease, in, wavelength, and, increase, in, frequency, and, energy, is, known, as, a, blueshift, or, negative, redshift, the, terms, derive, from, the, colours, red, and, blue, which, form, the, extremes, of, the, visible, light, spectrum, the, main, causes, of, electromagnetic, redshift, in, astronomy, and, cosmology, are, the, relative, motions, of, radiation, sources, which, give, rise, to, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, and, gravitational, potentials, which, gravitationally, redshift, escaping, radiation, all, sufficiently, distant, light, sources, show, cosmological, redshift, corresponding, to, recession, speeds, proportional, to, their, distances, from, earth, a, fact, known, as, hubble, s, law, that, implies, the, universe, is, expanding, all, redshifts, can, be, understood, under, the, umbrella, of, frame, transformation, laws, gravitational, waves, which, also, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, are, subject, to, the, same, redshift, phenomena, the, value, of, a, redshift, is, often, denoted, by, the, letter, z, corresponding, to, the, fractional, change, in, wavelength, positive, for, redshifts, negative, for, blueshifts, and, by, the, wavelength, ratio, 1, z, which, is, greater, than, 1, for, redshifts, and, less, than, 1, for, blueshifts, examples, of, strong, redshifting, are, a, gamma, ray, perceived, as, an, x, ray, or, initially, visible, light, perceived, as, radio, waves, subtler, redshifts, are, seen, in, the, spectroscopic, observations, of, astronomical, objects, and, are, used, in, terrestrial, technologies, such, as, doppler, radar, and, radar, guns, other, physical, processes, exist, that, can, lead, to, a, shift, in, the, frequency, of, electromagnetic, radiation, including, scattering, and, optical, effects, however, the, resulting, changes, are, distinguishable, from, astronomical, redshift, and, are, not, generally, referred, to, as, such, see, section, on, physical, optics, and, radiative, transfer, the, history, of, the, subject, began, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, development, of, classical, wave, mechanics, and, the, exploration, of, phenomena, which, are, associated, with, the, doppler, effect, the, effect, is, named, after, the, austrian, mathematician, christian, doppler, who, offered, the, first, known, physical, explanation, for, the, phenomenon, in, 1842, in, 1845, the, hypothesis, was, tested, and, confirmed, for, sound, waves, by, the, dutch, scientist, christophorus, buys, ballot, doppler, correctly, predicted, that, the, phenomenon, would, apply, to, all, waves, and, in, particular, suggested, that, the, varying, colors, of, stars, could, be, attributed, to, their, motion, with, respect, to, the, earth, before, this, was, verified, it, was, found, that, stellar, colors, were, primarily, due, to, a, star, s, temperature, not, motion, only, later, was, doppler, vindicated, by, verified, redshift, observations, the, doppler, redshift, was, first, described, by, french, physicist, hippolyte, fizeau, in, 1848, who, noted, the, shift, in, spectral, lines, seen, in, stars, as, being, due, to, the, doppler, effect, the, effect, is, sometimes, called, the, doppler, fizeau, effect, in, 1868, british, astronomer, william, huggins, was, the, first, to, determine, the, velocity, of, a, star, moving, away, from, the, earth, by, the, method, in, 1871, optical, redshift, was, confirmed, when, the, phenomenon, was, observed, in, fraunhofer, lines, using, solar, rotation, about, 0, 1, in, the, red, in, 1887, vogel, and, scheiner, discovered, the, annual, doppler, effect, the, yearly, change, in, the, doppler, shift, of, stars, located, near, the, ecliptic, due, to, the, orbital, velocity, of, the, earth, in, 1901, aristarkh, belopolsky, verified, optical, redshift, in, the, laboratory, using, a, system, of, rotating, mirrors, arthur, eddington, used, the, term, red, shift, as, early, as, 1923, although, the, word, does, not, appear, unhyphenated, until, about, 1934, when, willem, de, sitter, used, it, beginning, with, observations, in, 1912, vesto, slipher, discovered, that, most, spiral, galaxies, then, mostly, thought, to, be, spiral, nebulae, had, considerable, redshifts, slipher, first, reported, on, his, measurement, in, the, inaugural, volume, of, the, lowell, observatory, bulletin, three, years, later, he, wrote, a, review, in, the, journal, popular, astronomy, in, it, he, stated, that, the, early, discovery, that, the, great, andromeda, spiral, had, the, quite, exceptional, velocity, of, 300, km, s, showed, the, means, then, available, capable, of, investigating, not, only, the, spectra, of, the, spirals, but, their, velocities, as, well, slipher, reported, the, velocities, for, 15, spiral, nebulae, spread, across, the, entire, celestial, sphere, all, but, three, having, observable, positive, that, is, recessional, velocities, subsequently, edwin, hubble, discovered, an, approximate, relationship, between, the, redshifts, of, such, nebulae, and, the, distances, to, them, with, the, formulation, of, his, eponymous, hubble, s, law, milton, humason, worked, on, those, observations, with, hubble, these, observations, corroborated, alexander, friedmann, s, 1922, work, in, which, he, derived, the, friedmann, lema, tre, equations, they, are, now, considered, to, be, strong, evidence, for, an, expanding, universe, and, the, big, bang, theory, the, spectrum, of, light, that, comes, from, a, source, see, idealized, spectrum, illustration, top, right, can, be, measured, to, determine, the, redshift, one, searches, for, features, in, the, spectrum, such, as, absorption, lines, emission, lines, or, other, variations, in, light, intensity, if, found, these, features, can, be, compared, with, known, features, in, the, spectrum, of, various, chemical, compounds, found, in, experiments, where, that, compound, is, located, on, earth, a, very, common, atomic, element, in, space, is, hydrogen, the, spectrum, of, originally, featureless, light, shone, through, hydrogen, will, show, a, signature, spectrum, specific, to, hydrogen, that, has, features, at, regular, intervals, if, restricted, to, absorption, lines, it, would, look, similar, to, the, illustration, top, right, if, the, same, pattern, of, intervals, is, seen, in, an, observed, spectrum, from, a, distant, source, but, occurring, at, shifted, wavelengths, it, can, be, identified, as, hydrogen, too, if, the, same, spectral, line, is, identified, in, both, spectra, but, at, different, wavelengths, then, the, redshift, can, be, calculated, using, the, table, below, determining, the, redshift, of, an, object, in, this, way, requires, a, frequency, or, wavelength, range, in, order, to, calculate, the, redshift, one, has, to, know, the, wavelength, of, the, emitted, light, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, source, in, other, words, the, wavelength, that, would, be, measured, by, an, observer, located, adjacent, to, and, comoving, with, the, source, since, in, astronomical, applications, this, measurement, cannot, be, done, directly, because, that, would, require, traveling, to, the, distant, star, of, interest, the, method, using, spectral, lines, described, here, is, used, instead, redshifts, cannot, be, calculated, by, looking, at, unidentified, features, whose, rest, frame, frequency, is, unknown, or, with, a, spectrum, that, is, featureless, or, white, noise, random, fluctuations, in, a, spectrum, redshift, and, blueshift, may, be, characterized, by, the, relative, difference, between, the, observed, and, emitted, wavelengths, or, frequency, of, an, object, in, astronomy, it, is, customary, to, refer, to, this, change, using, a, dimensionless, quantity, called, z, if, represents, wavelength, and, f, represents, frequency, note, f, c, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, then, z, is, defined, by, the, equations, after, z, is, measured, the, distinction, between, redshift, and, blueshift, is, simply, a, matter, of, whether, z, is, positive, or, negative, for, example, doppler, effect, blueshifts, z, 0, are, associated, with, objects, approaching, moving, closer, to, the, observer, with, the, light, shifting, to, greater, energies, conversely, doppler, effect, redshifts, z, 0, are, associated, with, objects, receding, moving, away, from, the, observer, with, the, light, shifting, to, lower, energies, likewise, gravitational, blueshifts, are, associated, with, light, emitted, from, a, source, residing, within, a, weaker, gravitational, field, as, observed, from, within, a, stronger, gravitational, field, while, gravitational, redshifting, implies, the, opposite, conditions, in, general, relativity, one, can, derive, several, important, special, case, formulae, for, redshift, in, certain, special, spacetime, geometries, as, summarized, in, the, following, table, in, all, cases, the, magnitude, of, the, shift, the, value, of, z, is, independent, of, the, wavelength, for, motion, completely, in, the, radial, or, line, of, sight, direction, for, motion, completely, in, the, transverse, direction, hubble, s, law, for, the, schwarzschild, geometry, in, terms, of, escape, velocity, for, v, e, c, displaystyle, v, text, e, ll, c, if, a, source, of, the, light, is, moving, away, from, an, observer, then, redshift, z, 0, occurs, if, the, source, moves, towards, the, observer, then, blueshift, z, 0, occurs, this, is, true, for, all, electromagnetic, waves, and, is, explained, by, the, doppler, effect, consequently, this, type, of, redshift, is, called, the, doppler, redshift, if, the, source, moves, away, from, the, observer, with, velocity, v, which, is, much, less, than, the, speed, of, light, v, c, the, redshift, is, given, by, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, in, the, classical, doppler, effect, the, frequency, of, the, source, is, not, modified, but, the, recessional, motion, causes, the, illusion, of, a, lower, frequency, a, more, complete, treatment, of, the, doppler, redshift, requires, considering, relativistic, effects, associated, with, motion, of, sources, close, to, the, speed, of, light, a, complete, derivation, of, the, effect, can, be, found, in, the, article, on, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, in, brief, objects, moving, close, to, the, speed, of, light, will, experience, deviations, from, the, above, formula, due, to, the, time, dilation, of, special, relativity, which, can, be, corrected, for, by, introducing, the, lorentz, factor, into, the, classical, doppler, formula, as, follows, for, motion, solely, in, the, line, of, sight, this, phenomenon, was, first, observed, in, a, 1938, experiment, performed, by, herbert, e, ives, and, g, r, stilwell, called, the, ives, stilwell, experiment, since, the, lorentz, factor, is, dependent, only, on, the, magnitude, of, the, velocity, this, causes, the, redshift, associated, with, the, relativistic, correction, to, be, independent, of, the, orientation, of, the, source, movement, in, contrast, the, classical, part, of, the, formula, is, dependent, on, the, projection, of, the, movement, of, the, source, into, the, line, of, sight, which, yields, different, results, for, different, orientations, if, is, the, angle, between, the, direction, of, relative, motion, and, the, direction, of, emission, in, the, observer, s, frame, zero, angle, is, directly, away, from, the, observer, the, full, form, for, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, becomes, and, for, motion, solely, in, the, line, of, sight, 0, this, equation, reduces, to, for, the, special, case, that, the, light, is, moving, at, right, angle, 90, to, the, direction, of, relative, motion, in, the, observer, s, frame, the, relativistic, redshift, is, known, as, the, transverse, redshift, and, a, redshift, is, measured, even, though, the, object, is, not, moving, away, from, the, observer, even, when, the, source, is, moving, towards, the, observer, if, there, is, a, transverse, component, to, the, motion, then, there, is, some, speed, at, which, the, dilation, just, cancels, the, expected, blueshift, and, at, higher, speed, the, approaching, source, will, be, redshifted, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, twentieth, century, slipher, wirtz, and, others, made, the, first, measurements, of, the, redshifts, and, blueshifts, of, galaxies, beyond, the, milky, way, they, initially, interpreted, these, redshifts, and, blueshifts, as, being, due, to, random, motions, but, later, lema, tre, 1927, and, hubble, 1929, using, previous, data, discovered, a, roughly, linear, correlation, between, the, increasing, redshifts, of, and, distances, to, galaxies, lema, tre, realized, that, these, observations, could, be, explained, by, a, mechanism, of, producing, redshifts, seen, in, friedmann, s, solutions, to, einstein, s, equations, of, general, relativity, the, correlation, between, redshifts, and, distances, arises, in, all, expanding, models, this, cosmological, redshift, is, commonly, attributed, to, stretching, of, the, wavelengths, of, photons, propagating, through, the, expanding, space, this, interpretation, can, be, misleading, however, expanding, space, is, only, a, choice, of, coordinates, and, thus, cannot, have, physical, consequences, the, cosmological, redshift, is, more, naturally, interpreted, as, a, doppler, shift, arising, due, to, the, recession, of, distant, objects, the, observational, consequences, of, this, effect, can, be, derived, using, the, equations, from, general, relativity, that, describe, a, homogeneous, and, isotropic, universe, the, cosmological, redshift, can, thus, be, written, as, a, function, of, a, the, time, dependent, cosmic, scale, factor, in, an, expanding, universe, such, as, the, one, we, inhabit, the, scale, factor, is, monotonically, increasing, as, time, passes, thus, z, is, positive, and, distant, galaxies, appear, redshifted, using, a, model, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, redshift, can, be, related, to, the, age, of, an, observed, object, the, so, called, cosmic, time, redshift, relation, denote, a, density, ratio, as, 0, with, crit, the, critical, density, demarcating, a, universe, that, eventually, crunches, from, one, that, simply, expands, this, density, is, about, three, hydrogen, atoms, per, cubic, meter, of, space, at, large, redshifts, 1, z, 0, 1, one, finds, where, h, 0, is, the, present, day, hubble, constant, and, z, is, the, redshift, there, are, several, websites, for, calculating, various, times, and, distances, from, redshift, as, the, precise, calculations, require, numerical, integrals, for, most, values, of, the, parameters, for, cosmological, redshifts, of, z, 0, 01, additional, doppler, redshifts, and, blueshifts, due, to, the, peculiar, motions, of, the, galaxies, relative, to, one, another, cause, a, wide, scatter, from, the, standard, hubble, law, the, resulting, situation, can, be, illustrated, by, the, expanding, rubber, sheet, universe, a, common, cosmological, analogy, used, to, describe, the, expansion, of, space, if, two, objects, are, represented, by, ball, bearings, and, spacetime, by, a, stretching, rubber, sheet, the, doppler, effect, is, caused, by, rolling, the, balls, across, the, sheet, to, create, peculiar, motion, the, cosmological, redshift, occurs, when, the, ball, bearings, are, stuck, to, the, sheet, and, the, sheet, is, stretched, the, redshifts, of, galaxies, include, both, a, component, related, to, recessional, velocity, from, expansion, of, the, universe, and, a, component, related, to, peculiar, motion, doppler, shift, the, redshift, due, to, expansion, of, the, universe, depends, upon, the, recessional, velocity, in, a, fashion, determined, by, the, cosmological, model, chosen, to, describe, the, expansion, of, the, universe, which, is, very, different, from, how, doppler, redshift, depends, upon, local, velocity, describing, the, cosmological, expansion, origin, of, redshift, cosmologist, edward, robert, harrison, said, light, leaves, a, galaxy, which, is, stationary, in, its, local, region, of, space, and, is, eventually, received, by, observers, who, are, stationary, in, their, own, local, region, of, space, between, the, galaxy, and, the, observer, light, travels, through, vast, regions, of, expanding, space, as, a, result, all, wavelengths, of, the, light, are, stretched, by, the, expansion, of, space, it, is, as, simple, as, that, steven, weinberg, clarified, the, increase, of, wavelength, from, emission, to, absorption, of, light, does, not, depend, on, the, rate, of, change, of, a, t, at, the, times, of, emission, or, absorption, but, on, the, increase, of, a, t, in, the, whole, period, from, emission, to, absorption, if, the, universe, were, contracting, instead, of, expanding, we, would, see, distant, galaxies, blueshifted, by, an, amount, proportional, to, their, distance, instead, of, redshifted, in, the, theory, of, general, relativity, there, is, time, dilation, within, a, gravitational, well, this, is, known, as, the, gravitational, redshift, or, einstein, shift, the, theoretical, derivation, of, this, effect, follows, from, the, schwarzschild, solution, of, the, einstein, equations, which, yields, the, following, formula, for, redshift, associated, with, a, photon, traveling, in, the, gravitational, field, of, an, uncharged, nonrotating, spherically, symmetric, mass, where, this, gravitational, redshift, result, can, be, derived, from, the, assumptions, of, special, relativity, and, the, equivalence, principle, the, full, theory, of, general, relativity, is, not, required, the, effect, is, very, small, but, measurable, on, earth, using, the, m, ssbauer, effect, and, was, first, observed, in, the, pound, rebka, experiment, however, it, is, significant, near, a, black, hole, and, as, an, object, approaches, the, event, horizon, the, red, shift, becomes, infinite, it, is, also, the, dominant, cause, of, large, angular, scale, temperature, fluctuations, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, see, sachs, wolfe, effect, the, redshift, observed, in, astronomy, can, be, measured, because, the, emission, and, absorption, spectra, for, atoms, are, distinctive, and, well, known, calibrated, from, spectroscopic, experiments, in, laboratories, on, earth, when, the, redshift, of, various, absorption, and, emission, lines, from, a, single, astronomical, object, is, measured, z, is, found, to, be, remarkably, constant, although, distant, objects, may, be, slightly, blurred, and, lines, broadened, it, is, by, no, more, than, can, be, explained, by, thermal, or, mechanical, motion, of, the, source, for, these, reasons, and, others, the, consensus, among, astronomers, is, that, the, redshifts, they, observe, are, due, to, some, combination, of, the, three, established, forms, of, doppler, like, redshifts, alternative, hypotheses, and, explanations, for, redshift, such, as, tired, light, are, not, generally, considered, plausible, spectroscopy, as, a, measurement, is, considerably, more, difficult, than, simple, photometry, which, measures, the, brightness, of, astronomical, objects, through, certain, filters, when, photometric, data, is, all, that, is, available, for, example, the, hubble, deep, field, and, the, hubble, ultra, deep, field, astronomers, rely, on, a, technique, for, measuring, photometric, redshifts, due, to, the, broad, wavelength, ranges, in, photometric, filters, and, the, necessary, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, the, spectrum, at, the, light, source, errors, for, these, sorts, of, measurements, can, range, up, to, z, 0, 5, and, are, much, less, reliable, than, spectroscopic, determinations, however, photometry, does, at, least, allow, a, qualitative, characterization, of, a, redshift, for, example, if, a, sun, like, spectrum, had, a, redshift, of, z, 1, it, would, be, brightest, in, the, infrared, 1000nm, rather, than, at, the, blue, green, 500nm, color, associated, with, the, peak, of, its, blackbody, spectrum, and, the, light, intensity, will, be, reduced, in, the, filter, by, a, factor, of, four, 1, z, 2, both, the, photon, count, rate, and, the, photon, energy, are, redshifted, see, k, correction, for, more, details, on, the, photometric, consequences, of, redshift, in, nearby, objects, within, our, milky, way, galaxy, observed, redshifts, are, almost, always, related, to, the, line, of, sight, velocities, associated, with, the, objects, being, observed, observations, of, such, redshifts, and, blueshifts, have, enabled, astronomers, to, measure, velocities, and, parametrize, the, masses, of, the, orbiting, stars, in, spectroscopic, binaries, a, method, first, employed, in, 1868, by, british, astronomer, william, huggins, similarly, small, redshifts, and, blueshifts, detected, in, the, spectroscopic, measurements, of, individual, stars, are, one, way, astronomers, have, been, able, to, diagnose, and, measure, the, presence, and, characteristics, of, planetary, systems, around, other, stars, and, have, even, made, very, detailed, differential, measurements, of, redshifts, during, planetary, transits, to, determine, precise, orbital, parameters, finely, detailed, measurements, of, redshifts, are, used, in, helioseismology, to, determine, the, precise, movements, of, the, photosphere, of, the, sun, redshifts, have, also, been, used, to, make, the, first, measurements, of, the, rotation, rates, of, planets, velocities, of, interstellar, clouds, the, rotation, of, galaxies, and, the, dynamics, of, accretion, onto, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, which, exhibit, both, doppler, and, gravitational, redshifts, the, temperatures, of, various, emitting, and, absorbing, objects, can, be, obtained, by, measuring, doppler, broadening, effectively, redshifts, and, blueshifts, over, a, single, emission, or, absorption, line, by, measuring, the, broadening, and, shifts, of, the, 21, centimeter, hydrogen, line, in, different, directions, astronomers, have, been, able, to, measure, the, recessional, velocities, of, interstellar, gas, which, in, turn, reveals, the, rotation, curve, of, our, milky, way, similar, measurements, have, been, performed, on, other, galaxies, such, as, andromeda, as, a, diagnostic, tool, redshift, measurements, are, one, of, the, most, important, spectroscopic, measurements, made, in, astronomy, the, most, distant, objects, exhibit, larger, redshifts, corresponding, to, the, hubble, flow, of, the, universe, the, largest, observed, redshift, corresponding, to, the, greatest, distance, and, furthest, back, in, time, is, that, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, the, numerical, value, of, its, redshift, is, about, z, 1089, z, 0, corresponds, to, present, time, and, it, shows, the, state, of, the, universe, about, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, and, 379, 000, years, after, the, initial, moments, of, the, big, bang, the, luminous, point, like, cores, of, quasars, were, the, first, high, redshift, z, 0, 1, objects, discovered, before, the, improvement, of, telescopes, allowed, for, the, discovery, of, other, high, redshift, galaxies, for, galaxies, more, distant, than, the, local, group, and, the, nearby, virgo, cluster, but, within, a, thousand, mega, parsecs, or, so, the, redshift, is, approximately, proportional, to, the, galaxy, s, distance, this, correlation, was, first, observed, by, edwin, hubble, and, has, come, to, be, known, as, hubble, s, law, vesto, slipher, was, the, first, to, discover, galactic, redshifts, in, about, 1912, while, hubble, correlated, slipher, s, measurements, with, distances, he, measured, by, other, means, to, formulate, his, law, in, the, widely, accepted, cosmological, model, based, on, general, relativity, redshift, is, mainly, a, result, of, the, expansion, of, space, this, means, that, the, farther, away, a, galaxy, is, from, us, the, more, the, space, has, expanded, in, the, time, since, the, light, left, that, galaxy, so, the, more, the, light, has, been, stretched, the, more, redshifted, the, light, is, and, so, the, faster, it, appears, to, be, moving, away, from, us, hubble, s, law, follows, in, part, from, the, copernican, principle, because, it, is, usually, not, known, how, luminous, objects, are, measuring, the, redshift, is, easier, than, more, direct, distance, measurements, so, redshift, is, sometimes, in, practice, converted, to, a, crude, distance, measurement, using, hubble, s, law, gravitational, interactions, of, galaxies, with, each, other, and, clusters, cause, a, significant, scatter, in, the, normal, plot, of, the, hubble, diagram, the, peculiar, velocities, associated, with, galaxies, superimpose, a, rough, trace, of, the, mass, of, virialized, objects, in, the, universe, this, effect, leads, to, such, phenomena, as, nearby, galaxies, such, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, exhibiting, blueshifts, as, we, fall, towards, a, common, barycenter, and, redshift, maps, of, clusters, showing, a, fingers, of, god, effect, due, to, the, scatter, of, peculiar, velocities, in, a, roughly, spherical, distribution, this, added, component, gives, cosmologists, a, chance, to, measure, the, masses, of, objects, independent, of, the, mass, to, light, ratio, the, ratio, of, a, galaxy, s, mass, in, solar, masses, to, its, brightness, in, solar, luminosities, an, important, tool, for, measuring, dark, matter, the, hubble, law, s, linear, relationship, between, distance, and, redshift, assumes, that, the, rate, of, expansion, of, the, universe, is, constant, however, when, the, universe, was, much, younger, the, expansion, rate, and, thus, the, hubble, constant, was, larger, than, it, is, today, for, more, distant, galaxies, then, whose, light, has, been, travelling, to, us, for, much, longer, times, the, approximation, of, constant, expansion, rate, fails, and, the, hubble, law, becomes, a, non, linear, integral, relationship, and, dependent, on, the, history, of, the, expansion, rate, since, the, emission, of, the, light, from, the, galaxy, in, question, observations, of, the, redshift, distance, relationship, can, be, used, then, to, determine, the, expansion, history, of, the, universe, and, thus, the, matter, and, energy, content, while, it, was, long, believed, that, the, expansion, rate, has, been, continuously, decreasing, since, the, big, bang, observations, beginning, in, 1988, of, the, redshift, distance, relationship, using, type, ia, supernovae, have, suggested, that, in, comparatively, recent, times, the, expansion, rate, of, the, universe, has, begun, to, accelerate, currently, the, objects, with, the, highest, known, redshifts, are, galaxies, and, the, objects, producing, gamma, ray, bursts, the, most, reliable, redshifts, are, from, spectroscopic, data, and, the, highest, confirmed, spectroscopic, redshift, of, a, galaxy, is, that, of, jades, gs, z14, 0, with, a, redshift, of, z, 14, 32, corresponding, to, 290, million, years, after, the, big, bang, the, previous, record, was, held, by, gn, z11, with, a, redshift, of, z, 11, 1, corresponding, to, 400, million, years, after, the, big, bang, and, by, udfy, 38135539, at, a, redshift, of, z, 8, 6, corresponding, to, 600, million, years, after, the, big, bang, slightly, less, reliable, are, lyman, break, redshifts, the, highest, of, which, is, the, lensed, galaxy, a1689, zd1, at, a, redshift, z, 7, 5, and, the, next, highest, being, z, 7, 0, the, most, distant, observed, gamma, ray, burst, with, a, spectroscopic, redshift, measurement, was, grb, 090423, which, had, a, redshift, of, z, 8, 2, the, most, distant, known, quasar, ulas, j1342, 0928, is, at, z, 7, 54, the, highest, known, redshift, radio, galaxy, tgss1530, is, at, a, redshift, z, 5, 72, and, the, highest, known, redshift, molecular, material, is, the, detection, of, emission, from, the, co, molecule, from, the, quasar, sdss, j1148, 5251, at, z, 6, 42, extremely, red, objects, eros, are, astronomical, sources, of, radiation, that, radiate, energy, in, the, red, and, near, infrared, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, these, may, be, starburst, galaxies, that, have, a, high, redshift, accompanied, by, reddening, from, intervening, dust, or, they, could, be, highly, redshifted, elliptical, galaxies, with, an, older, and, therefore, redder, stellar, population, objects, that, are, even, redder, than, eros, are, termed, hyper, extremely, red, objects, heros, the, cosmic, microwave, background, has, a, redshift, of, z, 1089, corresponding, to, an, age, of, approximately, 379, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, and, a, proper, distance, of, more, than, 46, billion, light, years, the, yet, to, be, observed, first, light, from, the, oldest, population, iii, stars, not, long, after, atoms, first, formed, and, the, cmb, ceased, to, be, absorbed, almost, completely, may, have, redshifts, in, the, range, of, 20, z, 100, other, high, redshift, events, predicted, by, physics, but, not, presently, observable, are, the, cosmic, neutrino, background, from, about, two, seconds, after, the, big, bang, and, a, redshift, in, excess, of, z, 10, 10, and, the, cosmic, gravitational, wave, background, emitted, directly, from, inflation, at, a, redshift, in, excess, of, z, 10, 25, in, june, 2015, astronomers, reported, evidence, for, population, iii, stars, in, the, cosmos, redshift, 7, galaxy, at, z, 6, 60, such, stars, are, likely, to, have, existed, in, the, very, early, universe, i, e, at, high, redshift, and, may, have, started, the, production, of, chemical, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, that, are, needed, for, the, later, formation, of, planets, and, life, as, we, know, it, with, advent, of, automated, telescopes, and, improvements, in, spectroscopes, a, number, of, collaborations, have, been, made, to, map, the, universe, in, redshift, space, by, combining, redshift, with, angular, position, data, a, redshift, survey, maps, the, 3d, distribution, of, matter, within, a, field, of, the, sky, these, observations, are, used, to, measure, properties, of, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, the, great, wall, a, vast, supercluster, of, galaxies, over, 500, million, light, years, wide, provides, a, dramatic, example, of, a, large, scale, structure, that, redshift, surveys, can, detect, the, first, redshift, survey, was, the, cfa, redshift, survey, started, in, 1977, with, the, initial, data, collection, completed, in, 1982, more, recently, the, 2df, galaxy, redshift, survey, determined, the, large, scale, structure, of, one, section, of, the, universe, measuring, redshifts, for, over, 220, 000, galaxies, data, collection, was, completed, in, 2002, and, the, final, data, set, was, released, 30, june, 2003, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, sdss, is, ongoing, as, of, 2013, and, aims, to, measure, the, redshifts, of, around, 3, million, objects, sdss, has, recorded, redshifts, for, galaxies, as, high, as, 0, 8, and, has, been, involved, in, the, detection, of, quasars, beyond, z, 6, the, deep2, redshift, survey, uses, the, keck, telescopes, with, the, new, deimos, spectrograph, a, follow, up, to, the, pilot, program, deep1, deep2, is, designed, to, measure, faint, galaxies, with, redshifts, 0, 7, and, above, and, it, is, therefore, planned, to, provide, a, high, redshift, complement, to, sdss, and, 2df, the, interactions, and, phenomena, summarized, in, the, subjects, of, radiative, transfer, and, physical, optics, can, result, in, shifts, in, the, wavelength, and, frequency, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, such, cases, the, shifts, correspond, to, a, physical, energy, transfer, to, matter, or, other, photons, rather, than, being, by, a, transformation, between, reference, frames, such, shifts, can, be, from, such, physical, phenomena, as, coherence, effects, or, the, scattering, of, electromagnetic, radiation, whether, from, charged, elementary, particles, from, particulates, or, from, fluctuations, of, the, index, of, refraction, in, a, dielectric, medium, as, occurs, in, the, radio, phenomenon, of, radio, whistlers, while, such, phenomena, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, redshifts, and, blueshifts, in, astrophysics, light, matter, interactions, that, result, in, energy, shifts, in, the, radiation, field, are, generally, referred, to, as, reddening, rather, than, redshifting, which, as, a, term, is, normally, reserved, for, the, effects, discussed, above, in, many, circumstances, scattering, causes, radiation, to, redden, because, entropy, results, in, the, predominance, of, many, low, energy, photons, over, few, high, energy, ones, while, conserving, total, energy, except, possibly, under, carefully, controlled, conditions, scattering, does, not, produce, the, same, relative, change, in, wavelength, across, the, whole, spectrum, that, is, any, calculated, z, is, generally, a, function, of, wavelength, furthermore, scattering, from, random, media, generally, occurs, at, many, angles, and, z, is, a, function, of, the, scattering, angle, if, multiple, scattering, occurs, or, the, scattering, particles, have, relative, motion, then, there, is, generally, distortion, of, spectral, lines, as, well, in, interstellar, astronomy, visible, spectra, can, appear, redder, due, to, scattering, processes, in, a, phenomenon, referred, to, as, interstellar, reddening, similarly, rayleigh, scattering, causes, the, atmospheric, reddening, of, the, sun, seen, in, the, sunrise, or, sunset, and, causes, the, rest, of, the, sky, to, have, a, blue, color, this, phenomenon, is, distinct, from, red, shift, ing, because, the, spectroscopic, lines, are, not, shifted, to, other, wavelengths, in, reddened, objects, and, there, is, an, additional, dimming, and, distortion, associated, with, the, phenomenon, due, to, photons, being, scattered, in, and, out, of, the, line, of, sight, the, opposite, of, a, redshift, is, a, blueshift, a, blueshift, is, any, decrease, in, wavelength, increase, in, energy, with, a, corresponding, increase, in, frequency, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, in, visible, light, this, shifts, a, color, towards, the, blue, end, of, the, spectrum, doppler, blueshift, is, caused, by, movement, of, a, source, towards, the, observer, the, term, applies, to, any, decrease, in, wavelength, and, increase, in, frequency, caused, by, relative, motion, even, outside, the, visible, spectrum, only, objects, moving, at, near, relativistic, speeds, toward, the, observer, are, noticeably, bluer, to, the, naked, eye, but, the, wavelength, of, any, reflected, or, emitted, photon, or, other, particle, is, shortened, in, the, direction, of, travel, doppler, blueshift, is, used, in, astronomy, to, determine, relative, motion, unlike, the, relative, doppler, blueshift, caused, by, movement, of, a, source, towards, the, observer, and, thus, dependent, on, the, received, angle, of, the, photon, gravitational, blueshift, is, absolute, and, does, not, depend, on, the, received, angle, of, the, photon, photons, climbing, out, of, a, gravitating, object, become, less, energetic, this, loss, of, energy, is, known, as, a, redshifting, as, photons, in, the, visible, spectrum, would, appear, more, red, similarly, photons, falling, into, a, gravitational, field, become, more, energetic, and, exhibit, a, blueshifting, note, that, the, magnitude, of, the, redshifting, blueshifting, effect, is, not, a, function, of, the, emitted, angle, or, the, received, angle, of, the, photon, it, depends, only, on, how, far, radially, the, photon, had, to, climb, out, of, fall, into, the, potential, well, it, is, a, natural, consequence, of, conservation, of, energy, and, mass, energy, equivalence, and, was, confirmed, experimentally, in, 1959, with, the, pound, rebka, experiment, gravitational, blueshift, contributes, to, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, anisotropy, via, the, sachs, wolfe, effect, when, a, gravitational, well, evolves, while, a, photon, is, passing, the, amount, of, blueshift, on, approach, will, differ, from, the, amount, of, gravitational, redshift, as, it, leaves, the, region, there, are, faraway, active, galaxies, that, show, a, blueshift, in, their, emission, lines, one, of, the, largest, blueshifts, is, found, in, the, narrow, line, quasar, pg, 1543, 489, which, has, a, relative, velocity, of, 1150, km, s, these, types, of, galaxies, are, called, blue, outliers, in, a, hypothetical, universe, undergoing, a, runaway, big, crunch, contraction, a, cosmological, blueshift, would, be, observed, with, galaxies, further, away, being, increasingly, blueshifted, the, exact, opposite, of, the, actually, observed, cosmological, redshift, in, the, present, expanding, universe
