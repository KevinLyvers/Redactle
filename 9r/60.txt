the, fahrenheit, scale, f, r, n, h, a, t, f, r, is, a, temperature, scale, based, on, one, proposed, in, 1724, by, the, european, physicist, daniel, gabriel, fahrenheit, 1686, 1736, it, uses, the, degree, fahrenheit, symbol, f, as, the, unit, several, accounts, of, how, he, originally, defined, his, scale, exist, but, the, original, paper, suggests, the, lower, defining, point, 0, f, was, established, as, the, freezing, temperature, of, a, solution, of, brine, made, from, a, mixture, of, water, ice, and, ammonium, chloride, a, salt, the, other, limit, established, was, his, best, estimate, of, the, average, human, body, temperature, originally, set, at, 90, f, then, 96, f, about, 2, 6, f, less, than, the, modern, value, due, to, a, later, redefinition, of, the, scale, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, fahrenheit, scale, was, defined, by, two, fixed, points, with, a, 180, f, separation, the, temperature, at, which, pure, water, freezes, was, defined, as, 32, f, and, the, boiling, point, of, water, was, defined, to, be, 212, f, both, at, sea, level, and, under, standard, atmospheric, pressure, it, is, now, formally, defined, using, the, kelvin, scale, it, continues, to, be, used, in, the, united, states, including, its, unincorporated, territories, its, freely, associated, states, in, the, western, pacific, palau, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, and, the, marshall, islands, the, cayman, islands, and, liberia, fahrenheit, is, commonly, still, used, alongside, the, celsius, scale, in, other, countries, that, use, the, u, s, metrological, service, such, as, antigua, and, barbuda, saint, kitts, and, nevis, the, bahamas, and, belize, a, handful, of, british, overseas, territories, including, the, virgin, islands, montserrat, anguilla, and, bermuda, also, still, use, both, scales, all, other, countries, now, use, celsius, centigrade, until, 1948, which, was, invented, 18, years, after, the, fahrenheit, scale, historically, on, the, fahrenheit, scale, the, freezing, point, of, water, was, 32, f, and, the, boiling, point, was, 212, f, at, standard, atmospheric, pressure, this, put, the, boiling, and, freezing, points, of, water, 180, degrees, apart, therefore, a, degree, on, the, fahrenheit, scale, was, 1, 180, of, the, interval, between, the, freezing, point, and, the, boiling, point, on, the, celsius, scale, the, freezing, and, boiling, points, of, water, were, originally, defined, to, be, 100, degrees, apart, a, temperature, interval, of, 1, f, was, equal, to, an, interval, of, 5, 9, degrees, celsius, with, the, fahrenheit, and, celsius, scales, now, both, defined, by, the, kelvin, this, relationship, was, preserved, a, temperature, interval, of, 1, f, being, equal, to, an, interval, of, 5, 9, k, and, of, 5, 9, c, the, fahrenheit, and, celsius, scales, intersect, numerically, at, 40, in, the, respective, unit, i, e, 40, f, 40, c, absolute, zero, is, 0, k, 273, 15, c, or, 459, 67, f, the, rankine, temperature, scale, uses, degree, intervals, of, the, same, size, as, those, of, the, fahrenheit, scale, except, that, absolute, zero, is, 0, r, the, same, way, that, the, kelvin, temperature, scale, matches, the, celsius, scale, except, that, absolute, zero, is, 0, k, the, combination, of, degree, symbol, followed, by, an, uppercase, letter, f, is, the, conventional, symbol, for, the, fahrenheit, temperature, scale, a, number, followed, by, this, symbol, and, separated, from, it, with, a, space, denotes, a, specific, temperature, point, e, g, gallium, melts, at, 85, 5763, f, a, difference, between, temperatures, or, an, uncertainty, in, temperature, is, also, conventionally, written, the, same, way, as, well, e, g, the, output, of, the, heat, exchanger, experiences, an, increase, of, 72, f, or, our, standard, uncertainty, is, 5, f, however, some, authors, instead, use, the, notation, an, increase, of, 50, f, reversing, the, symbol, order, to, indicate, temperature, differences, similar, conventions, exist, for, the, celsius, scale, see, celsius, temperatures, and, intervals, for, an, exact, conversion, between, degrees, fahrenheit, and, celsius, and, kelvins, of, a, specific, temperature, point, the, following, formulas, can, be, applied, here, f, is, the, value, in, degrees, fahrenheit, c, the, value, in, degrees, celsius, and, k, the, value, in, kelvins, there, is, also, an, exact, conversion, between, celsius, and, fahrenheit, scales, making, use, of, the, correspondence, 40, f, 40, c, again, f, is, the, numeric, value, in, degrees, fahrenheit, and, c, the, numeric, value, in, degrees, celsius, when, converting, a, temperature, interval, between, the, fahrenheit, and, celsius, scales, only, the, ratio, is, used, without, any, constant, in, this, case, the, interval, has, the, same, numeric, value, in, kelvins, as, in, degrees, celsius, fahrenheit, proposed, his, temperature, scale, in, 1724, basing, it, on, two, reference, points, of, temperature, in, his, initial, scale, which, is, not, the, final, fahrenheit, scale, the, zero, point, was, determined, by, placing, the, thermometer, in, a, mixture, of, ice, water, and, salis, armoniaci, or, even, sea, salt, this, combination, forms, a, eutectic, system, which, stabilizes, its, temperature, automatically, 0, f, was, defined, to, be, that, stable, temperature, a, second, point, 96, degrees, was, approximately, the, human, body, s, temperature, a, third, point, 32, degrees, was, marked, as, being, the, temperature, of, ice, and, water, without, the, aforementioned, salts, according, to, a, german, story, fahrenheit, actually, chose, the, lowest, air, temperature, measured, in, his, hometown, danzig, gda, sk, poland, in, winter, 1708, 09, as, 0, f, and, only, later, had, the, need, to, be, able, to, make, this, value, reproducible, using, brine, according, to, a, letter, fahrenheit, wrote, to, his, friend, herman, boerhaave, his, scale, was, built, on, the, work, of, ole, r, mer, whom, he, had, met, earlier, in, r, mer, scale, brine, freezes, at, zero, water, freezes, and, melts, at, 7, 5, degrees, body, temperature, is, 22, 5, and, water, boils, at, 60, degrees, fahrenheit, multiplied, each, value, by, 4, in, order, to, eliminate, fractions, and, make, the, scale, more, fine, grained, he, then, re, calibrated, his, scale, using, the, melting, point, of, ice, and, normal, human, body, temperature, which, were, at, 30, and, 90, degrees, he, adjusted, the, scale, so, that, the, melting, point, of, ice, would, be, 32, degrees, and, body, temperature, 96, degrees, so, that, 64, intervals, would, separate, the, two, allowing, him, to, mark, degree, lines, on, his, instruments, by, simply, bisecting, the, interval, 6, times, since, 64, 2, 6, fahrenheit, soon, after, observed, that, water, boils, at, about, 212, degrees, using, this, scale, the, use, of, the, freezing, and, boiling, points, of, water, as, thermometer, fixed, reference, points, became, popular, following, the, work, of, anders, celsius, and, these, fixed, points, were, adopted, by, a, committee, of, the, royal, society, led, by, henry, cavendish, in, 1776, 77, under, this, system, the, fahrenheit, scale, is, redefined, slightly, so, that, the, freezing, point, of, water, was, exactly, 32, f, and, the, boiling, point, was, exactly, 212, f, or, 180, degrees, higher, it, is, for, this, reason, that, normal, human, body, temperature, is, approximately, 98, 6, f, oral, temperature, on, the, revised, scale, whereas, it, was, 90, on, fahrenheit, s, multiplication, of, r, mer, and, 96, on, his, original, scale, in, the, present, day, fahrenheit, scale, 0, f, no, longer, corresponds, to, the, eutectic, temperature, of, ammonium, chloride, brine, as, described, above, instead, that, eutectic, is, at, approximately, 4, f, on, the, final, fahrenheit, scale, the, rankine, temperature, scale, was, based, upon, the, fahrenheit, temperature, scale, with, its, zero, representing, absolute, zero, instead, the, fahrenheit, scale, was, the, primary, temperature, standard, for, climatic, industrial, and, medical, purposes, in, anglophone, countries, until, the, 1960s, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, celsius, scale, replaced, fahrenheit, in, almost, all, of, those, countries, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, united, states, fahrenheit, is, used, in, the, united, states, its, territories, and, associated, states, all, serviced, by, the, u, s, national, weather, service, as, well, as, the, british, cayman, islands, and, liberia, for, everyday, applications, the, fahrenheit, scale, is, in, use, in, u, s, for, all, temperature, measurements, including, weather, forecasts, cooking, and, food, freezing, temperatures, however, for, scientific, research, the, scale, is, celsius, and, kelvin, early, in, the, 20th, century, halsey, and, dale, suggested, that, reasons, for, resistance, to, use, the, centigrade, now, celsius, system, in, the, u, s, included, the, larger, size, of, each, degree, celsius, and, the, lower, zero, point, in, the, fahrenheit, system, put, another, way, the, fahrenheit, scale, is, more, intuitive, than, celsius, for, describing, outdoor, temperatures, in, temperate, latitudes, with, 100, f, being, a, hot, summer, day, and, 0, f, a, cold, winter, day, canada, has, passed, legislation, favoring, the, international, system, of, units, while, also, maintaining, legal, definitions, for, traditional, canadian, imperial, units, canadian, weather, reports, are, conveyed, using, degrees, celsius, with, occasional, reference, to, fahrenheit, especially, for, cross, border, broadcasts, fahrenheit, is, still, used, on, virtually, all, canadian, ovens, thermometers, both, digital, and, analog, sold, in, canada, usually, employ, both, the, celsius, and, fahrenheit, scales, in, the, european, union, it, is, mandatory, to, use, kelvins, or, degrees, celsius, when, quoting, temperature, for, economic, public, health, public, safety, and, administrative, purposes, though, degrees, fahrenheit, may, be, used, alongside, degrees, celsius, as, a, supplementary, unit, most, brits, think, and, use, celsius, however, the, use, of, fahrenheit, still, may, appear, at, times, alongside, degrees, celsius, in, the, print, media, with, no, standard, convention, for, when, the, measurement, is, included, for, example, the, times, has, an, all, metric, daily, weather, page, but, includes, a, celsius, to, fahrenheit, conversion, table, some, uk, tabloids, have, adopted, a, tendency, of, using, fahrenheit, for, mid, to, high, temperatures, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, rationale, to, keep, using, fahrenheit, was, one, of, emphasis, for, high, tempatures, 6, c, sounds, colder, than, 21, f, and, 94, f, sounds, more, sensational, than, 34, c, unicode, provides, the, fahrenheit, symbol, at, code, point, u, 2109, degree, fahrenheit, however, this, is, a, compatibility, character, encoded, for, roundtrip, compatibility, with, legacy, encodings, the, unicode, standard, explicitly, discourages, the, use, of, this, character, the, sequence, u, 00b0, degree, sign, u, 0046, f, latin, capital, letter, f, is, preferred, over, u, 2109, degree, fahrenheit, and, those, two, sequences, should, be, treated, as, identical, for, searching
