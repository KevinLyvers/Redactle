in, physics, electromagnetism, is, an, interaction, that, occurs, between, particles, with, electric, charge, via, electromagnetic, fields, the, electromagnetic, force, is, one, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, it, is, the, dominant, force, in, the, interactions, of, atoms, and, molecules, electromagnetism, can, be, thought, of, as, a, combination, of, electrostatics, and, magnetism, which, are, distinct, but, closely, intertwined, phenomena, electromagnetic, forces, occur, between, any, two, charged, particles, electric, forces, cause, an, attraction, between, particles, with, opposite, charges, and, repulsion, between, particles, with, the, same, charge, while, magnetism, is, an, interaction, that, occurs, between, charged, particles, in, relative, motion, these, two, forces, are, described, in, terms, of, electromagnetic, fields, macroscopic, charged, objects, are, described, in, terms, of, coulomb, s, law, for, electricity, and, amp, re, s, force, law, for, magnetism, the, lorentz, force, describes, microscopic, charged, particles, the, electromagnetic, force, is, responsible, for, many, of, the, chemical, and, physical, phenomena, observed, in, daily, life, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, atomic, nuclei, and, their, electrons, holds, atoms, together, electric, forces, also, allow, different, atoms, to, combine, into, molecules, including, the, macromolecules, such, as, proteins, that, form, the, basis, of, life, meanwhile, magnetic, interactions, between, the, spin, and, angular, momentum, magnetic, moments, of, electrons, also, play, a, role, in, chemical, reactivity, such, relationships, are, studied, in, spin, chemistry, electromagnetism, also, plays, several, crucial, roles, in, modern, technology, electrical, energy, production, transformation, and, distribution, light, heat, and, sound, production, and, detection, fiber, optic, and, wireless, communication, sensors, computation, electrolysis, electroplating, and, mechanical, motors, and, actuators, electromagnetism, has, been, studied, since, ancient, times, many, ancient, civilizations, including, the, greeks, and, the, mayans, created, wide, ranging, theories, to, explain, lightning, static, electricity, and, the, attraction, between, magnetized, pieces, of, iron, ore, however, it, was, not, until, the, late, 18th, century, that, scientists, began, to, develop, a, mathematical, basis, for, understanding, the, nature, of, electromagnetic, interactions, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, prominent, scientists, and, mathematicians, such, as, coulomb, gauss, and, faraday, developed, namesake, laws, which, helped, to, explain, the, formation, and, interaction, of, electromagnetic, fields, this, process, culminated, in, the, 1860s, with, the, discovery, of, maxwell, s, equations, a, set, of, four, partial, differential, equations, which, provide, a, complete, description, of, classical, electromagnetic, fields, maxwell, s, equations, provided, a, sound, mathematical, basis, for, the, relationships, between, electricity, and, magnetism, that, scientists, had, been, exploring, for, centuries, and, predicted, the, existence, of, self, sustaining, electromagnetic, waves, maxwell, postulated, that, such, waves, make, up, visible, light, which, was, later, shown, to, be, true, gamma, rays, x, rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, radiation, microwaves, and, radio, waves, were, all, determined, to, be, electromagnetic, radiation, differing, only, in, their, range, of, frequencies, in, the, modern, era, scientists, have, continued, to, refine, the, theorem, of, electromagnetism, to, take, into, account, the, effects, of, modern, physics, including, quantum, mechanics, and, relativity, the, theoretical, implications, of, electromagnetism, particularly, the, establishment, of, the, speed, of, light, based, on, properties, of, the, medium, of, propagation, permeability, and, permittivity, helped, inspire, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, in, 1905, meanwhile, the, field, of, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, has, modified, maxwell, s, equations, to, be, consistent, with, the, quantized, nature, of, matter, in, qed, the, changes, in, the, electromagnetic, field, is, expressed, in, terms, of, discrete, excitations, particles, known, as, photons, the, quanta, of, light, investigation, into, electromagnetic, phenomena, began, about, 5, 000, years, ago, there, is, evidence, that, the, ancient, chinese, mayan, and, potentially, even, egyptian, civilizations, knew, that, the, naturally, magnetic, mineral, magnetite, had, attractive, properties, and, many, incorporated, it, into, their, art, and, architecture, ancient, people, were, also, aware, of, lightning, and, static, electricity, although, they, had, no, idea, of, the, mechanisms, behind, these, phenomena, the, greek, philosopher, thales, of, miletus, discovered, around, 600, b, c, e, that, amber, could, acquire, an, electric, charge, when, it, was, rubbed, with, cloth, which, allowed, it, to, pick, up, light, objects, such, as, pieces, of, straw, thales, also, experimented, with, the, ability, of, magnetic, rocks, to, attract, one, other, and, hypothesized, that, this, phenomenon, might, be, connected, to, the, attractive, power, of, amber, foreshadowing, the, deep, connections, between, electricity, and, magnetism, that, would, be, discovered, over, 2, 000, years, later, despite, all, this, investigation, ancient, civilizations, had, no, understanding, of, the, mathematical, basis, of, electromagnetism, and, often, analyzed, its, impacts, through, the, lens, of, religion, rather, than, science, lightning, for, instance, was, considered, to, be, a, creation, of, the, gods, in, many, cultures, electricity, and, magnetism, were, originally, considered, to, be, two, separate, forces, this, view, changed, with, the, publication, of, james, clerk, maxwell, s, 1873, a, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, in, which, the, interactions, of, positive, and, negative, charges, were, shown, to, be, mediated, by, one, force, there, are, four, main, effects, resulting, from, these, interactions, all, of, which, have, been, clearly, demonstrated, by, experiments, in, april, 1820, hans, christian, rsted, observed, that, an, electrical, current, in, a, wire, caused, a, nearby, compass, needle, to, move, at, the, time, of, discovery, rsted, did, not, suggest, any, satisfactory, explanation, of, the, phenomenon, nor, did, he, try, to, represent, the, phenomenon, in, a, mathematical, framework, however, three, months, later, he, began, more, intensive, investigations, soon, thereafter, he, published, his, findings, proving, that, an, electric, current, produces, a, magnetic, field, as, it, flows, through, a, wire, the, cgs, unit, of, magnetic, induction, oersted, is, named, in, honor, of, his, contributions, to, the, field, of, electromagnetism, his, findings, resulted, in, intensive, research, throughout, the, scientific, community, in, electrodynamics, they, influenced, french, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, s, developments, of, a, single, mathematical, form, to, represent, the, magnetic, forces, between, current, carrying, conductors, rsted, s, discovery, also, represented, a, major, step, toward, a, unified, concept, of, energy, this, unification, which, was, observed, by, michael, faraday, extended, by, james, clerk, maxwell, and, partially, reformulated, by, oliver, heaviside, and, heinrich, hertz, is, one, of, the, key, accomplishments, of, 19th, century, mathematical, physics, it, has, had, far, reaching, consequences, one, of, which, was, the, understanding, of, the, nature, of, light, unlike, what, was, proposed, by, the, electromagnetic, theory, of, that, time, light, and, other, electromagnetic, waves, are, at, present, seen, as, taking, the, form, of, quantized, self, propagating, oscillatory, electromagnetic, field, disturbances, called, photons, different, frequencies, of, oscillation, give, rise, to, the, different, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, from, radio, waves, at, the, lowest, frequencies, to, visible, light, at, intermediate, frequencies, to, gamma, rays, at, the, highest, frequencies, rsted, was, not, the, only, person, to, examine, the, relationship, between, electricity, and, magnetism, in, 1802, gian, domenico, romagnosi, an, italian, legal, scholar, deflected, a, magnetic, needle, using, a, voltaic, pile, the, factual, setup, of, the, experiment, is, not, completely, clear, nor, if, current, flowed, across, the, needle, or, not, an, account, of, the, discovery, was, published, in, 1802, in, an, italian, newspaper, but, it, was, largely, overlooked, by, the, contemporary, scientific, community, because, romagnosi, seemingly, did, not, belong, to, this, community, an, earlier, 1735, and, often, neglected, connection, between, electricity, and, magnetism, was, reported, by, a, dr, cookson, the, account, stated, a, tradesman, at, wakefield, in, yorkshire, having, put, up, a, great, number, of, knives, and, forks, in, a, large, box, and, having, placed, the, box, in, the, corner, of, a, large, room, there, happened, a, sudden, storm, of, thunder, lightning, c, the, owner, emptying, the, box, on, a, counter, where, some, nails, lay, the, persons, who, took, up, the, knives, that, lay, on, the, nails, observed, that, the, knives, took, up, the, nails, on, this, the, whole, number, was, tried, and, found, to, do, the, same, and, that, to, such, a, degree, as, to, take, up, large, nails, packing, needles, and, other, iron, things, of, considerable, weight, e, t, whittaker, suggested, in, 1910, that, this, particular, event, was, responsible, for, lightning, to, be, credited, with, the, power, of, magnetizing, steel, and, it, was, doubtless, this, which, led, franklin, in, 1751, to, attempt, to, magnetize, a, sewing, needle, by, means, of, the, discharge, of, leyden, jars, the, electromagnetic, force, is, the, second, strongest, of, the, four, known, fundamental, forces, it, operates, with, infinite, range, all, other, forces, e, g, friction, contact, forces, are, derived, from, these, four, fundamental, forces, and, they, are, known, as, non, fundamental, forces, at, high, energy, the, weak, force, and, electromagnetic, force, are, unified, as, a, single, interaction, called, the, electroweak, interaction, roughly, speaking, all, the, forces, involved, in, interactions, between, atoms, can, be, explained, by, the, electromagnetic, force, acting, between, the, electrically, charged, atomic, nuclei, and, electrons, of, the, atoms, electromagnetic, forces, also, explain, how, these, particles, carry, momentum, by, their, movement, this, includes, the, forces, we, experience, in, pushing, or, pulling, ordinary, material, objects, which, result, from, the, intermolecular, forces, that, act, between, the, individual, molecules, in, our, bodies, and, those, in, the, objects, the, electromagnetic, force, is, also, involved, in, all, forms, of, chemical, phenomena, a, necessary, part, of, understanding, the, intra, atomic, and, intermolecular, forces, is, the, effective, force, generated, by, the, momentum, of, the, electrons, movement, such, that, as, electrons, move, between, interacting, atoms, they, carry, momentum, with, them, as, a, collection, of, electrons, becomes, more, confined, their, minimum, momentum, necessarily, increases, due, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, the, behaviour, of, matter, at, the, molecular, scale, including, its, density, is, determined, by, the, balance, between, the, electromagnetic, force, and, the, force, generated, by, the, exchange, of, momentum, carried, by, the, electrons, themselves, in, 1600, william, gilbert, proposed, in, his, de, magnete, that, electricity, and, magnetism, while, both, capable, of, causing, attraction, and, repulsion, of, objects, were, distinct, effects, mariners, had, noticed, that, lightning, strikes, had, the, ability, to, disturb, a, compass, needle, the, link, between, lightning, and, electricity, was, not, confirmed, until, benjamin, franklin, s, proposed, experiments, in, 1752, were, conducted, on, 10, may, 1752, by, thomas, fran, ois, dalibard, of, france, using, a, 40, foot, tall, 12, m, iron, rod, instead, of, a, kite, and, he, successfully, extracted, electrical, sparks, from, a, cloud, one, of, the, first, to, discover, and, publish, a, link, between, human, made, electric, current, and, magnetism, was, gian, romagnosi, who, in, 1802, noticed, that, connecting, a, wire, across, a, voltaic, pile, deflected, a, nearby, compass, needle, however, the, effect, did, not, become, widely, known, until, 1820, when, rsted, performed, a, similar, experiment, rsted, s, work, influenced, amp, re, to, conduct, further, experiments, which, eventually, gave, rise, to, a, new, area, of, physics, electrodynamics, by, determining, a, force, law, for, the, interaction, between, elements, of, electric, current, amp, re, placed, the, subject, on, a, solid, mathematical, foundation, a, theory, of, electromagnetism, known, as, classical, electromagnetism, was, developed, by, several, physicists, during, the, period, between, 1820, and, 1873, when, james, clerk, maxwell, s, treatise, was, published, which, unified, previous, developments, into, a, single, theory, proposing, that, light, was, an, electromagnetic, wave, propagating, in, the, luminiferous, ether, in, classical, electromagnetism, the, behavior, of, the, electromagnetic, field, is, described, by, a, set, of, equations, known, as, maxwell, s, equations, and, the, electromagnetic, force, is, given, by, the, lorentz, force, law, one, of, the, peculiarities, of, classical, electromagnetism, is, that, it, is, difficult, to, reconcile, with, classical, mechanics, but, it, is, compatible, with, special, relativity, according, to, maxwell, s, equations, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, a, universal, constant, that, is, dependent, only, on, the, electrical, permittivity, and, magnetic, permeability, of, free, space, this, violates, galilean, invariance, a, long, standing, cornerstone, of, classical, mechanics, one, way, to, reconcile, the, two, theories, electromagnetism, and, classical, mechanics, is, to, assume, the, existence, of, a, luminiferous, aether, through, which, the, light, propagates, however, subsequent, experimental, efforts, failed, to, detect, the, presence, of, the, aether, after, important, contributions, of, hendrik, lorentz, and, henri, poincar, in, 1905, albert, einstein, solved, the, problem, with, the, introduction, of, special, relativity, which, replaced, classical, kinematics, with, a, new, theory, of, kinematics, compatible, with, classical, electromagnetism, for, more, information, see, history, of, special, relativity, in, addition, relativity, theory, implies, that, in, moving, frames, of, reference, a, magnetic, field, transforms, to, a, field, with, a, nonzero, electric, component, and, conversely, a, moving, electric, field, transforms, to, a, nonzero, magnetic, component, thus, firmly, showing, that, the, phenomena, are, two, sides, of, the, same, coin, hence, the, term, electromagnetism, for, more, information, see, classical, electromagnetism, and, special, relativity, and, covariant, formulation, of, classical, electromagnetism, today, few, problems, in, electromagnetism, remain, unsolved, these, include, the, lack, of, magnetic, monopoles, abraham, minkowski, controversy, the, location, in, space, of, the, electromagnetic, field, energy, and, the, mechanism, by, which, some, organisms, can, sense, electric, and, magnetic, fields, the, maxwell, equations, are, linear, in, that, a, change, in, the, sources, the, charges, and, currents, results, in, a, proportional, change, of, the, fields, nonlinear, dynamics, can, occur, when, electromagnetic, fields, couple, to, matter, that, follows, nonlinear, dynamical, laws, this, is, studied, for, example, in, the, subject, of, magnetohydrodynamics, which, combines, maxwell, theory, with, the, navier, stokes, equations, another, branch, of, electromagnetism, dealing, with, nonlinearity, is, nonlinear, optics, here, is, a, list, of, common, units, related, to, electromagnetism, in, the, electromagnetic, cgs, system, electric, current, is, a, fundamental, quantity, defined, via, amp, re, s, law, and, takes, the, permeability, as, a, dimensionless, quantity, relative, permeability, whose, value, in, vacuum, is, unity, as, a, consequence, the, square, of, the, speed, of, light, appears, explicitly, in, some, of, the, equations, interrelating, quantities, in, this, system, formulas, for, physical, laws, of, electromagnetism, such, as, maxwell, s, equations, need, to, be, adjusted, depending, on, what, system, of, units, one, uses, this, is, because, there, is, no, one, to, one, correspondence, between, electromagnetic, units, in, si, and, those, in, cgs, as, is, the, case, for, mechanical, units, furthermore, within, cgs, there, are, several, plausible, choices, of, electromagnetic, units, leading, to, different, unit, sub, systems, including, gaussian, esu, emu, and, heaviside, lorentz, among, these, choices, gaussian, units, are, the, most, common, today, and, in, fact, the, phrase, cgs, units, is, often, used, to, refer, specifically, to, cgs, gaussian, units, the, study, of, electromagnetism, informs, electric, circuits, magnetic, circuits, and, semiconductor, devices, construction
