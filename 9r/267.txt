a, neutron, star, is, the, collapsed, core, of, a, massive, supergiant, star, it, results, from, the, supernova, explosion, of, a, massive, star, combined, with, gravitational, collapse, that, compresses, the, core, past, white, dwarf, star, density, to, that, of, atomic, nuclei, except, for, black, holes, neutron, stars, are, the, smallest, and, densest, known, class, of, stellar, objects, they, have, a, radius, on, the, order, of, 10, kilometers, 6, mi, and, a, mass, of, about, 1, 4, m, stars, that, collapse, into, neutron, stars, have, a, total, mass, of, between, 10, and, 25, solar, masses, m, or, possibly, more, for, those, that, are, especially, rich, in, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, once, formed, neutron, stars, no, longer, actively, generate, heat, and, cool, over, time, but, they, may, still, evolve, further, through, collisions, or, accretion, most, of, the, basic, models, for, these, objects, imply, that, they, are, composed, almost, entirely, of, neutrons, as, the, extreme, pressure, causes, the, electrons, and, protons, present, in, normal, matter, to, combine, into, additional, neutrons, these, stars, are, partially, supported, against, further, collapse, by, neutron, degeneracy, pressure, just, as, white, dwarfs, are, supported, against, collapse, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, however, this, is, not, by, itself, sufficient, to, hold, up, an, object, beyond, 0, 7, m, and, repulsive, nuclear, forces, increasingly, contribute, to, supporting, more, massive, neutron, stars, if, the, remnant, star, has, a, mass, exceeding, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, which, ranges, from, 2, 2, 2, 9, m, the, combination, of, degeneracy, pressure, and, nuclear, forces, is, insufficient, to, support, the, neutron, star, causing, it, to, collapse, and, form, a, black, hole, the, most, massive, neutron, star, detected, so, far, psr, j0952, 0607, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 35, 0, 17, m, newly, formed, neutron, stars, may, have, surface, temperatures, of, ten, million, k, or, more, however, since, neutron, stars, generate, no, new, heat, through, fusion, they, inexorably, cool, down, after, their, formation, consequently, a, given, neutron, star, reaches, a, surface, temperature, of, one, million, k, when, it, is, between, one, thousand, and, one, million, years, old, older, and, even, cooler, neutron, stars, are, still, easy, to, discover, for, example, the, well, studied, neutron, star, rx, j1856, 5, 3754, has, an, average, surface, temperature, of, about, 434, 000, k, for, comparison, the, sun, has, an, effective, surface, temperature, of, 5, 780, k, neutron, star, material, is, remarkably, dense, a, normal, sized, matchbox, containing, neutron, star, material, would, have, a, weight, of, approximately, 3, billion, tonnes, the, same, weight, as, a, 0, 5, cubic, kilometer, chunk, of, the, earth, a, cube, with, edges, of, about, 800, meters, from, earth, s, surface, as, a, star, s, core, collapses, its, rotation, rate, increases, due, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, so, newly, formed, neutron, stars, typically, rotate, at, up, to, several, hundred, times, per, second, some, neutron, stars, emit, beams, of, electromagnetic, radiation, that, make, them, detectable, as, pulsars, and, the, discovery, of, pulsars, by, jocelyn, bell, burnell, and, antony, hewish, in, 1967, was, the, first, observational, suggestion, that, neutron, stars, exist, the, fastest, spinning, neutron, star, known, is, psr, j1748, 2446ad, rotating, at, a, rate, of, 716, times, per, second, or, 43, 000, revolutions, per, minute, giving, a, linear, tangential, speed, at, the, surface, on, the, order, of, 0, 24, c, i, e, nearly, a, quarter, the, speed, of, light, there, are, thought, to, be, around, one, billion, neutron, stars, in, the, milky, way, and, at, a, minimum, several, hundred, million, a, figure, obtained, by, estimating, the, number, of, stars, that, have, undergone, supernova, explosions, however, many, of, them, have, existed, for, a, long, period, of, time, and, have, cooled, down, considerably, these, stars, radiate, very, little, electromagnetic, radiation, most, neutron, stars, that, have, been, detected, occur, only, in, certain, situations, in, which, they, do, radiate, such, as, if, they, are, a, pulsar, or, a, part, of, a, binary, system, slow, rotating, and, non, accreting, neutron, stars, are, difficult, to, detect, due, to, the, absence, of, electromagnetic, radiation, however, since, the, hubble, space, telescope, s, detection, of, rx, j1856, 5, 3754, in, the, 1990s, a, few, nearby, neutron, stars, that, appear, to, emit, only, thermal, radiation, have, been, detected, neutron, stars, in, binary, systems, can, undergo, accretion, in, which, case, they, emit, large, amounts, of, x, rays, during, this, process, matter, is, deposited, on, the, surface, of, the, stars, forming, hotspots, that, can, be, sporadically, identified, as, x, ray, pulsar, systems, additionally, such, accretions, are, able, to, recycle, old, pulsars, causing, them, to, gain, mass, and, rotate, extremely, quickly, forming, millisecond, pulsars, furthermore, binary, systems, such, as, these, continue, to, evolve, with, many, companions, eventually, becoming, compact, objects, such, as, white, dwarfs, or, neutron, stars, themselves, though, other, possibilities, include, a, complete, destruction, of, the, companion, through, ablation, or, collision, the, study, of, neutron, star, systems, is, central, to, gravitational, wave, astronomy, the, merger, of, binary, neutron, stars, produces, gravitational, waves, and, may, be, associated, with, kilonovae, and, short, duration, gamma, ray, bursts, in, 2017, the, ligo, and, virgo, interferometer, sites, observed, gw170817, the, first, direct, detection, of, gravitational, waves, from, such, an, event, prior, to, this, indirect, evidence, for, gravitational, waves, was, inferred, by, studying, the, gravity, radiated, from, the, orbital, decay, of, a, different, type, of, unmerged, binary, neutron, system, the, hulse, taylor, pulsar, any, main, sequence, star, with, an, initial, mass, of, greater, than, 8, m, eight, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, has, the, potential, to, become, a, neutron, star, as, the, star, evolves, away, from, the, main, sequence, stellar, nucleosynthesis, produces, an, iron, rich, core, when, all, nuclear, fuel, in, the, core, has, been, exhausted, the, core, must, be, supported, by, degeneracy, pressure, alone, further, deposits, of, mass, from, shell, burning, cause, the, core, to, exceed, the, chandrasekhar, limit, electron, degeneracy, pressure, is, overcome, and, the, core, collapses, further, causing, temperatures, to, rise, to, over, 5, 10, 9, k, 5, billion, k, at, these, temperatures, photodisintegration, the, breakdown, of, iron, nuclei, into, alpha, particles, due, to, high, energy, gamma, rays, occurs, as, the, temperature, of, the, core, continues, to, rise, electrons, and, protons, combine, to, form, neutrons, via, electron, capture, releasing, a, flood, of, neutrinos, when, densities, reach, a, nuclear, density, of, 4, 10, 17, kg, m, 3, a, combination, of, strong, force, repulsion, and, neutron, degeneracy, pressure, halts, the, contraction, the, contracting, outer, envelope, of, the, star, is, halted, and, rapidly, flung, outwards, by, a, flux, of, neutrinos, produced, in, the, creation, of, the, neutrons, resulting, in, a, supernova, and, leaving, behind, a, neutron, star, however, if, the, remnant, has, a, mass, greater, than, about, 3, m, it, instead, becomes, a, black, hole, as, the, core, of, a, massive, star, is, compressed, during, a, type, ii, supernova, or, a, type, ib, or, type, ic, supernova, and, collapses, into, a, neutron, star, it, retains, most, of, its, angular, momentum, because, it, has, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, its, parent, s, radius, sharply, reducing, its, moment, of, inertia, a, neutron, star, is, formed, with, very, high, rotation, speed, and, then, over, a, very, long, period, it, slows, neutron, stars, are, known, that, have, rotation, periods, from, about, 1, 4, ms, to, 30, s, the, neutron, star, s, density, also, gives, it, very, high, surface, gravity, with, typical, values, ranging, from, 10, 12, to, 10, 13, m, s, 2, more, than, 10, 11, times, that, of, earth, one, measure, of, such, immense, gravity, is, the, fact, that, neutron, stars, have, an, escape, velocity, of, over, half, the, speed, of, light, the, neutron, star, s, gravity, accelerates, infalling, matter, to, tremendous, speed, and, tidal, forces, near, the, surface, can, cause, spaghettification, the, equation, of, state, of, neutron, stars, is, not, currently, known, this, is, because, neutron, stars, are, the, second, most, dense, known, object, in, the, universe, only, less, dense, than, black, holes, the, extreme, density, means, there, is, no, way, to, replicate, the, material, on, earth, in, laboratories, which, is, how, equations, of, state, for, other, things, like, ideal, gases, are, tested, the, closest, neutron, star, is, many, parsecs, away, meaning, there, is, no, feasible, way, to, study, it, directly, while, it, is, known, neutron, stars, should, be, similar, to, a, degenerate, gas, it, cannot, be, modeled, strictly, like, one, as, white, dwarfs, are, because, of, the, extreme, gravity, general, relativity, must, be, considered, for, the, neutron, star, equation, of, state, because, newtonian, gravity, is, no, longer, sufficient, in, those, conditions, effects, such, as, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, superconductivity, and, superfluidity, must, also, be, considered, at, the, extraordinarily, high, densities, of, neutron, stars, ordinary, matter, is, squeezed, to, nuclear, densities, specifically, the, matter, ranges, from, nuclei, embedded, in, a, sea, of, electrons, at, low, densities, in, the, outer, crust, to, increasingly, neutron, rich, structures, in, the, inner, crust, to, the, extremely, neutron, rich, uniform, matter, in, the, outer, core, and, possibly, exotic, states, of, matter, at, high, densities, in, the, inner, core, understanding, the, nature, of, the, matter, present, in, the, various, layers, of, neutron, stars, and, the, phase, transitions, that, occur, at, the, boundaries, of, the, layers, is, a, major, unsolved, problem, in, fundamental, physics, the, neutron, star, equation, of, state, encodes, information, about, the, structure, of, a, neutron, star, and, thus, tells, us, how, matter, behaves, at, the, extreme, densities, found, inside, neutron, stars, constraints, on, the, neutron, star, equation, of, state, would, then, provide, constraints, on, how, the, strong, force, of, the, standard, model, works, which, would, have, profound, implications, for, nuclear, and, atomic, physics, this, makes, neutron, stars, natural, laboratories, for, probing, fundamental, physics, for, example, the, exotic, states, that, may, be, found, at, the, cores, of, neutron, stars, are, types, of, qcd, matter, at, the, extreme, densities, at, the, centers, of, neutron, stars, neutrons, become, disrupted, giving, rise, to, a, sea, of, quarks, this, matter, s, equation, of, state, is, governed, by, the, laws, of, quantum, chromodynamics, and, since, qcd, matter, cannot, be, produced, in, any, laboratory, on, earth, most, of, the, current, knowledge, about, it, is, only, theoretical, different, equations, of, state, lead, to, different, values, of, observable, quantities, while, the, equation, of, state, is, only, directly, relating, the, density, and, pressure, it, also, leads, to, calculating, observables, like, the, speed, of, sound, mass, radius, and, love, numbers, because, the, equation, of, state, is, unknown, there, are, many, proposed, ones, such, as, fps, uu, apr, l, and, sly, and, it, is, an, active, area, of, research, different, factors, can, be, considered, when, creating, the, equation, of, state, such, as, phase, transitions, another, aspect, of, the, equation, of, state, is, whether, it, is, a, soft, or, stiff, equation, of, state, this, relates, to, how, much, pressure, there, is, at, a, certain, energy, density, and, often, corresponds, to, phase, transitions, when, the, material, is, about, to, go, through, a, phase, transition, the, pressure, will, tend, to, increase, until, it, shifts, into, a, more, comfortable, state, of, matter, a, soft, equation, of, state, would, have, a, gently, rising, pressure, versus, energy, density, while, a, stiff, one, would, have, a, sharper, rise, in, pressure, in, neutron, stars, nuclear, physicists, are, still, testing, whether, the, equation, of, state, should, be, stiff, or, soft, and, sometimes, it, changes, within, individual, equations, of, state, depending, on, the, phase, transitions, within, the, model, this, is, referred, to, as, the, equation, of, state, stiffening, or, softening, depending, on, the, previous, behavior, since, it, is, unknown, what, neutron, stars, are, made, of, there, is, room, for, different, phases, of, matter, to, be, explored, within, the, equation, of, state, neutron, stars, have, overall, densities, of, 3, 7, 10, 17, to, 5, 9, 10, 17, kg, m, 3, 2, 6, 10, 14, to, 4, 1, 10, 14, times, the, density, of, the, sun, which, is, comparable, to, the, approximate, density, of, an, atomic, nucleus, of, 3, 10, 17, kg, m, 3, the, density, increases, with, depth, varying, from, about, 1, 10, 9, kg, m, 3, at, the, crust, to, an, estimated, 6, 10, 17, or, 8, 10, 17, kg, m, 3, deeper, inside, pressure, increases, accordingly, from, about, 3, 2, 10, 31, pa, at, the, inner, crust, to, 1, 6, 10, 34, pa, in, the, center, a, neutron, star, is, so, dense, that, one, teaspoon, 5, milliliters, of, its, material, would, have, a, mass, over, 5, 5, 10, 12, kg, about, 900, times, the, mass, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, the, entire, mass, of, the, earth, at, neutron, star, density, would, fit, into, a, sphere, 305, m, in, diameter, about, the, size, of, the, arecibo, telescope, in, popular, scientific, writing, neutron, stars, are, sometimes, described, as, macroscopic, atomic, nuclei, indeed, both, states, are, composed, of, nucleons, and, they, share, a, similar, density, to, within, an, order, of, magnitude, however, in, other, respects, neutron, stars, and, atomic, nuclei, are, quite, different, a, nucleus, is, held, together, by, the, strong, interaction, whereas, a, neutron, star, is, held, together, by, gravity, the, density, of, a, nucleus, is, uniform, while, neutron, stars, are, predicted, to, consist, of, multiple, layers, with, varying, compositions, and, densities, because, equations, of, state, for, neutron, stars, lead, to, different, observables, such, as, different, mass, radius, relations, there, are, many, astronomical, constraints, on, equations, of, state, these, come, mostly, from, ligo, which, is, a, gravitational, wave, observatory, and, nicer, which, is, an, x, ray, telescope, nicer, s, observations, of, pulsars, in, binary, systems, from, which, the, pulsar, mass, and, radius, can, be, estimated, can, constrain, the, neutron, star, equation, of, state, a, 2021, measurement, of, the, pulsar, psr, j0740, 6620, was, able, to, constrain, the, radius, of, a, 1, 4, solar, mass, neutron, star, to, 12, 33, 0, 76, 0, 8, km, with, 95, confidence, these, mass, radius, constraints, combined, with, chiral, effective, field, theory, calculations, tightens, constraints, on, the, neutron, star, equation, of, state, equation, of, state, constraints, from, ligo, gravitational, wave, detections, start, with, nuclear, and, atomic, physics, researchers, who, work, to, propose, theoretical, equations, of, state, such, as, fps, uu, apr, l, sly, and, others, the, proposed, equations, of, state, can, then, be, passed, onto, astrophysics, researchers, who, run, simulations, of, binary, neutron, star, mergers, from, these, simulations, researchers, can, extract, gravitational, waveforms, thus, studying, the, relationship, between, the, equation, of, state, and, gravitational, waves, emitted, by, binary, neutron, star, mergers, using, these, relations, one, can, constrain, the, neutron, star, equation, of, state, when, gravitational, waves, from, binary, neutron, star, mergers, are, observed, past, numerical, relativity, simulations, of, binary, neutron, star, mergers, have, found, relationships, between, the, equation, of, state, and, frequency, dependent, peaks, of, the, gravitational, wave, signal, that, can, be, applied, to, ligo, detections, for, example, the, ligo, detection, of, the, binary, neutron, star, merger, gw170817, provided, limits, on, the, tidal, deformability, of, the, two, neutron, stars, which, dramatically, reduced, the, family, of, allowed, equations, of, state, future, gravitational, wave, signals, with, next, generation, detectors, like, cosmic, explorer, can, impose, further, constraints, when, nuclear, physicists, are, trying, to, understand, the, likelihood, of, their, equation, of, state, it, is, good, to, compare, with, these, constraints, to, see, if, it, predicts, neutron, stars, of, these, masses, and, radii, there, is, also, recent, work, on, constraining, the, equation, of, state, with, the, speed, of, sound, through, hydrodynamics, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, tov, equation, can, be, used, to, describe, a, neutron, star, the, equation, is, a, solution, to, einstein, s, equations, from, general, relativity, for, a, spherically, symmetric, time, invariant, metric, with, a, given, equation, of, state, solving, the, equation, leads, to, observables, such, as, the, mass, and, radius, there, are, many, codes, that, numerically, solve, the, tov, equation, for, a, given, equation, of, state, to, find, the, mass, radius, relation, and, other, observables, for, that, equation, of, state, the, following, differential, equations, can, be, solved, numerically, to, find, the, neutron, star, observables, d, p, d, r, g, r, m, r, c, 2, r, 2, 1, p, r, r, 1, 4, r, 3, p, r, m, r, c, 2, 1, 2, g, m, r, c, 2, r, displaystyle, frac, dp, dr, frac, g, epsilon, r, m, r, c, 2, r, 2, d, m, d, r, 4, r, 2, r, c, 2, displaystyle, frac, dm, dr, frac, 4, pi, r, 2, epsilon, r, c, 2, where, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, p, r, displaystyle, p, r, is, the, pressure, r, displaystyle, epsilon, r, is, the, energy, density, found, from, the, equation, of, state, and, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, speed, of, light, using, the, tov, equations, and, an, equation, of, state, a, mass, radius, curve, can, be, found, the, idea, is, that, for, the, correct, equation, of, state, every, neutron, star, that, could, possibly, exist, would, lie, along, that, curve, this, is, one, of, the, ways, equations, of, state, can, be, constrained, by, astronomical, observations, to, create, these, curves, one, must, solve, the, tov, equations, for, different, central, densities, for, each, central, density, you, numerically, solve, the, mass, and, pressure, equations, until, the, pressure, goes, to, zero, which, is, the, outside, of, the, star, each, solution, gives, a, corresponding, mass, and, radius, for, that, central, density, mass, radius, curves, determine, what, the, maximum, mass, is, for, a, given, equation, of, state, through, most, of, the, mass, radius, curve, each, radius, corresponds, to, a, unique, mass, value, at, a, certain, point, the, curve, will, reach, a, maximum, and, start, going, back, down, leading, to, repeated, mass, values, for, different, radii, this, maximum, point, is, what, is, known, as, the, maximum, mass, beyond, that, mass, the, star, will, no, longer, be, stable, i, e, no, longer, be, able, to, hold, itself, up, against, the, force, of, gravity, and, would, collapse, into, a, black, hole, since, each, equation, of, state, leads, to, a, different, mass, radius, curve, they, also, lead, to, a, unique, maximum, mass, value, the, maximum, mass, value, is, unknown, as, long, as, the, equation, of, state, remains, unknown, this, is, very, important, when, it, comes, to, constraining, the, equation, of, state, oppenheimer, and, volkoff, came, up, with, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, using, a, degenerate, gas, equation, of, state, with, the, tov, equations, that, was, 0, 7, solar, masses, since, the, neutron, stars, that, have, been, observed, are, more, massive, than, that, that, maximum, mass, was, discarded, the, most, recent, massive, neutron, star, that, was, observed, was, psr, j0952, 0607, which, was, 2, 35, 0, 17, solar, masses, any, equation, of, state, with, a, mass, less, than, that, would, not, predict, that, star, and, thus, is, much, less, likely, to, be, correct, an, interesting, phenomenon, in, this, area, of, astrophysics, relating, to, the, maximum, mass, of, neutron, stars, is, what, is, called, the, mass, gap, the, mass, gap, refers, to, a, range, of, masses, from, roughly, 2, 5, solar, masses, where, very, few, compact, objects, were, observed, this, range, is, based, on, the, current, assumed, maximum, mass, of, neutron, stars, 2, solar, masses, and, the, minimum, black, hole, mass, 5, solar, masses, recently, some, objects, have, been, discovered, that, fall, in, that, mass, gap, from, gravitational, wave, detections, if, the, true, maximum, mass, of, neutron, stars, was, known, it, would, help, characterize, compact, objects, in, that, mass, range, as, either, neutron, stars, or, black, holes, there, are, three, more, properties, of, neutron, stars, that, are, dependent, on, the, equation, of, state, but, can, also, be, astronomically, observed, the, moment, of, inertia, the, quadrupole, moment, and, the, love, number, the, moment, of, inertia, of, a, neutron, star, describes, how, fast, the, star, can, rotate, at, a, fixed, spin, momentum, the, quadrupole, moment, of, a, neutron, star, specifies, how, much, that, star, is, deformed, out, of, its, spherical, shape, the, love, number, of, the, neutron, star, represents, how, easy, or, difficult, it, is, to, deform, the, star, due, to, tidal, forces, typically, important, in, binary, systems, while, these, properties, depend, on, the, material, of, the, star, and, therefore, on, the, equation, of, state, there, is, a, relation, between, these, three, quantities, that, is, independent, of, the, equation, of, state, this, relation, assumes, slowly, and, uniformly, rotating, stars, and, uses, general, relativity, to, derive, the, relation, while, this, relation, would, not, be, able, to, add, constraints, to, the, equation, of, state, since, it, is, independent, of, the, equation, of, state, it, does, have, other, applications, if, one, of, these, three, quantities, can, be, measured, for, a, particular, neutron, star, this, relation, can, be, used, to, find, the, other, two, in, addition, this, relation, can, be, used, to, break, the, degeneracies, in, detections, by, gravitational, wave, detectors, of, the, quadrupole, moment, and, spin, allowing, the, average, spin, to, be, determined, within, a, certain, confidence, level, the, temperature, inside, a, newly, formed, neutron, star, is, from, around, 10, 11, to, 10, 12, kelvin, however, the, huge, number, of, neutrinos, it, emits, carries, away, so, much, energy, that, the, temperature, of, an, isolated, neutron, star, falls, within, a, few, years, to, around, 10, 6, kelvin, at, this, lower, temperature, most, of, the, light, generated, by, a, neutron, star, is, in, x, rays, some, researchers, have, proposed, a, neutron, star, classification, system, using, roman, numerals, not, to, be, confused, with, the, yerkes, luminosity, classes, for, non, degenerate, stars, to, sort, neutron, stars, by, their, mass, and, cooling, rates, type, i, for, neutron, stars, with, low, mass, and, cooling, rates, type, ii, for, neutron, stars, with, higher, mass, and, cooling, rates, and, a, proposed, type, iii, for, neutron, stars, with, even, higher, mass, approaching, 2, m, and, with, higher, cooling, rates, and, possibly, candidates, for, exotic, stars, the, magnetic, field, strength, on, the, surface, of, neutron, stars, ranges, from, c, 10, 4, to, 10, 11, tesla, t, these, are, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, in, any, other, object, for, comparison, a, continuous, 16, t, field, has, been, achieved, in, the, laboratory, and, is, sufficient, to, levitate, a, living, frog, due, to, diamagnetic, levitation, variations, in, magnetic, field, strengths, are, most, likely, the, main, factor, that, allows, different, types, of, neutron, stars, to, be, distinguished, by, their, spectra, and, explains, the, periodicity, of, pulsars, the, neutron, stars, known, as, magnetars, have, the, strongest, magnetic, fields, in, the, range, of, 10, 8, to, 10,

into, thin, cylinders, unlike, in, an, ordinary, pulsar, magnetar, spin, down, can, be, directly, powered, by, its, magnetic, field, and, the, magnetic, field, is, strong, enough, to, stress, the, crust, to, the, point, of, fracture, fractures, of, the, crust, cause, starquakes, observed, as, extremely, luminous, millisecond, hard, gamma, ray, bursts, the, fireball, is, trapped, by, the, magnetic, field, and, comes, in, and, out, of, view, when, the, star, rotates, which, is, observed, as, a, periodic, soft, gamma, repeater, sgr, emission, with, a, period, of, 5, 8, seconds, and, which, lasts, for, a, few, minutes, the, origins, of, the, strong, magnetic, field, are, as, yet, unclear, one, hypothesis, is, that, of, flux, freezing, or, conservation, of, the, original, magnetic, flux, during, the, formation, of, the, neutron, star, if, an, object, has, a, certain, magnetic, flux, over, its, surface, area, and, that, area, shrinks, to, a, smaller, area, but, the, magnetic, flux, is, conserved, then, the, magnetic, field, would, correspondingly, increase, likewise, a, collapsing, star, begins, with, a, much, larger, surface, area, than, the, resulting, neutron, star, and, conservation, of, magnetic, flux, would, result, in, a, far, stronger, magnetic, field, however, this, simple, explanation, does, not, fully, explain, magnetic, field, strengths, of, neutron, stars, the, gravitational, field, at, a, neutron, star, s, surface, is, about, 2, 10, 11, times, stronger, than, on, earth, at, around, 2, 0, 10, 12, m, s, 2, such, a, strong, gravitational, field, acts, as, a, gravitational, lens, and, bends, the, radiation, emitted, by, the, neutron, star, such, that, parts, of, the, normally, invisible, rear, surface, become, visible, if, the, radius, of, the, neutron, star, is, 3, gm, c, 2, or, less, then, the, photons, may, be, trapped, in, an, orbit, thus, making, the, whole, surface, of, that, neutron, star, visible, from, a, single, vantage, point, along, with, destabilizing, photon, orbits, at, or, below, the, 1, radius, distance, of, the, star, a, fraction, of, the, mass, of, a, star, that, collapses, to, form, a, neutron, star, is, released, in, the, supernova, explosion, from, which, it, forms, from, the, law, of, mass, energy, equivalence, e, mc, 2, the, energy, comes, from, the, gravitational, binding, energy, of, a, neutron, star, hence, the, gravitational, force, of, a, typical, neutron, star, is, huge, if, an, object, were, to, fall, from, a, height, of, one, meter, on, a, neutron, star, 12, kilometers, in, radius, it, would, reach, the, ground, at, around, 1, 400, kilometers, per, second, however, even, before, impact, the, tidal, force, would, cause, spaghettification, breaking, any, sort, of, an, ordinary, object, into, a, stream, of, material, because, of, the, enormous, gravity, time, dilation, between, a, neutron, star, and, earth, is, significant, for, example, eight, years, could, pass, on, the,

defined, by, existing, mathematical, models, but, it, might, be, possible, to, infer, some, details, through, studies, of, neutron, star, oscillations, asteroseismology, a, study, applied, to, ordinary, stars, can, reveal, the, inner, structure, of, neutron, stars, by, analyzing, observed, spectra, of, stellar, oscillations, current, models, indicate, that, matter, at, the, surface, of, a, neutron, star, is, composed, of, ordinary, atomic, nuclei, crushed, into, a, solid, lattice, with, a, sea, of, electrons, flowing, through, the, gaps, between, them, it, is, possible, that, the, nuclei, at, the, surface, are, iron, due, to, iron, s, high, binding, energy, per, nucleon, it, is, also, possible, that, heavy, elements, such, as, iron, simply, sink, beneath, the, surface, leaving, only, light, nuclei, like, helium, and, hydrogen, if, the, surface, temperature, exceeds, 10, 6, kelvins, as, in, the, case, of, a, young, pulsar, the, surface, should, be, fluid, instead, of, the, solid, phase, that, might, exist, in, cooler, neutron, stars, temperature, 10, 6, kelvins, the, atmosphere, of, a, neutron, star, is, hypothesized, to, be, at, most, several, micrometers, thick, and, its, dynamics, are, fully, controlled, by, the, neutron, star, s, magnetic, field, below, the, atmosphere, one, encounters, a, solid, crust, this, crust, is, extremely, hard, and, very, smooth, with, maximum, surface, irregularities, on, the, order, of, millimeters, or, less, due, to, the, extreme, gravitational, field, proceeding, inward, one, encounters, nuclei, with, ever, increasing, numbers, of, neutrons, such, nuclei, would, decay, quickly, on, earth, but, are, kept, stable, by, tremendous, pressures, as, this, process, continues, at, increasing, depths, the, neutron, drip, becomes, overwhelming, and, the, concentration, of, free, neutrons, increases, rapidly, after, a, supernova, explosion, of, a, supergiant, star, neutron, stars, are, born, from, the, remnants, a, neutron, star, is, composed, mostly, of, neutrons, neutral, particles, and, contains, a, small, fraction, of, protons, positively, charged, particles, and, electrons, negatively, charged, particles, as, well, as, nuclei, in, the, extreme, density, of, a, neutron, star, many, neutrons, are, free, neutrons, meaning, they, are, not, bound, in, atomic, nuclei, and, move, freely, within, the, star, s, dense, matter, especially, in, the, densest, regions, of, the, star, the, inner, crust, and, core, over, the, star, s, lifetime, as, its, density, increases, the, energy, of, the, electrons, also, increases, which, generates, more, neutrons, in, neutron, stars, the, neutron, drip, is, the, transition, point, where, nuclei, become, so, neutron, rich, that, they, can, no, longer, hold, additional, neutrons, leading, to, a, sea, of, free, neutrons, being, formed, the, sea, of, neutrons, formed, after, neutron, drip, provides, additional, pressure, support, which, helps, maintain, the, star, s, structural, integrity, and, prevents, gravitational, collapse, the, neutron, drip, takes, place, within, the, inner, crust, of, the, neutron, star, and, starts, when, the, density, becomes, so, high, that, nuclei, can, no, longer, hold, additional, neutrons, at, the, beginning, of, the, neutron, drip, the, pressure, in, the, star, from, neutrons, electrons, and, the, total, pressure, is, roughly, equal, as, the, density, of, the, neutron, star, increases, the, nuclei, break, down, and, the, neutron, pressure, of, the, star, becomes, dominant, when, the, density, reaches, a, point, where, nuclei, touch, and, subsequently, merge, they, form, a, fluid, of, neutrons, with, a, sprinkle, of, electrons, and, protons, this, transition, marks, the, neutron, drip, where, the, dominant, pressure, in, the, neutron, star, shifts, from, degenerate, electrons, to, neutrons, at, very, high, densities, the, neutron, pressure, becomes, the, primary, pressure, holding, up, the, star, with, neutrons, being, non, relativistic, moving, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, and, extremely, compressed, however, at, extremely, high, densities, neutrons, begin, to, move, at, relativistic, speeds, close, to, the, speed, of, light, these, high, speeds, significantly, increase, the, star, s, overall, pressure, altering, the, star, s, equilibrium, state, and, potentially, leading, to, the, formation, of, exotic, states, of, matter, in, that, region, there, are, nuclei, free, electrons, and, free, neutrons, the, nuclei, become, increasingly, small, gravity, and, pressure, overwhelming, the, strong, force, until, the, core, is, reached, by, definition, the, point, where, mostly, neutrons, exist, the, expected, hierarchy, of, phases, of, nuclear, matter, in, the, inner, crust, has, been, characterized, as, nuclear, pasta, with, fewer, voids, and, larger, structures, towards, higher, pressures, the, composition, of, the, superdense, matter, in, the, core, remains, uncertain, one, model, describes, the, core, as, superfluid, neutron, degenerate, matter, mostly, neutrons, with, some, protons, and, electrons, more, exotic, forms, of, matter, are, possible, including, degenerate, strange, matter, containing, strange, quarks, in, addition, to, up, and, down, quarks, matter, containing, high, energy, pions, and, kaons, in, addition, to, neutrons, or, ultra, dense, quark, degenerate, matter, neutron, stars, are, detected, from, their, electromagnetic, radiation, neutron, stars, are, usually, observed, to, pulse, radio, waves, and, other, electromagnetic, radiation, and, neutron, stars, observed, with, pulses, are, called, pulsars, pulsars, radiation, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, particle, acceleration, near, their, magnetic, poles, which, need, not, be, aligned, with, the, rotational, axis, of, the, neutron, star, it, is, thought, that, a, large, electrostatic, field, builds, up, near, the, magnetic, poles, leading, to, electron, emission, these, electrons, are, magnetically, accelerated, along, the, field, lines, leading, to, curvature, radiation, with, the, radiation, being, strongly, polarized, towards, the, plane, of, curvature, in, addition, high, energy, photons, can, interact, with, lower, energy, photons, and, the, magnetic, field, for, electron, positron, pair, production, which, through, electron, positron, annihilation, leads, to, further, high, energy, photons, the, radiation, emanating, from, the, magnetic, poles, of, neutron, stars, can, be, described, as, magnetospheric, radiation, in, reference, to, the, magnetosphere, of, the, neutron, star, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, magnetic, dipole, radiation, which, is, emitted, because, the, magnetic, axis, is, not, aligned, with, the, rotational, axis, with, a, radiation, frequency, the, same, as, the, neutron, star, s, rotational, frequency, if, the, axis, of, rotation, of, the, neutron, star, is, different, from, the, magnetic, axis, external, viewers, will, only, see, these, beams, of, radiation, whenever, the, magnetic, axis, point, towards, them, during, the, neutron, star, rotation, therefore, periodic, pulses, are, observed, at, the, same, rate, as, the, rotation, of, the, neutron, star, in, may, 2022, astronomers, reported, an, ultra, long, period, radio, emitting, neutron, star, psr, j0901, 4046, with, spin, properties, distinct, from, the, known, neutron, stars, it, is, unclear, how, its, radio, emission, is, generated, and, it, challenges, the, current, understanding, of, how, pulsars, evolve, in, addition, to, pulsars, non, pulsating, neutron, stars, have, also, been, identified, although, they, may, have, minor, periodic, variation, in, luminosity, this, seems, to, be, a, characteristic, of, the, x, ray, sources, known, as, central, compact, objects, in, supernova, remnants, ccos, in, snrs, which, are, thought, to, be, young, radio, quiet, isolated, neutron, stars, in, addition, to, radio, emissions, neutron, stars, have, also, been, identified, in, other, parts, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, this, includes, visible, light, near, infrared, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, pulsars, observed, in, x, rays, are, known, as, x, ray, pulsars, if, accretion, powered, while, those, identified, in, visible, light, are, known, as, optical, pulsars, the, majority, of, neutron, stars, detected, including, those, identified, in, optical, x, ray, and, gamma, rays, also, emit, radio, waves, the, crab, pulsar, produces, electromagnetic, emissions, across, the, spectrum, however, there, exist, neutron, stars, called, radio, quiet, neutron, stars, with, no, radio, emissions, detected, neutron, stars, rotate, extremely, rapidly, after, their, formation, due, to, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, in, analogy, to, spinning, ice, skaters, pulling, in, their, arms, the, slow, rotation, of, the, original, star, s, core, speeds, up, as, it, shrinks, a, newborn, neutron, star, can, rotate, many, times, a, second, over, time, neutron, stars, slow, as, their, rotating, magnetic, fields, in, effect, radiate, energy, associated, with, the, rotation, older, neutron, stars, may, take, several, seconds, for, each, revolution, this, is, called, spin, down, the, rate, at, which, a, neutron, star, slows, its, rotation, is, usually, constant, and, very, small, the, periodic, time, p, is, the, rotational, period, the, time, for, one, rotation, of, a, neutron, star, the, spin, down, rate, the, rate, of, slowing, of, rotation, is, then, given, the, symbol, p, displaystyle, dot, p, p, dot, the, derivative, of, p, with, respect, to, time, it, is, defined, as, periodic, time, increase, per, unit, time, it, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, but, can, be, given, the, units, of, s, s, 1, seconds, per, second, the, spin, down, rate, p, dot, of, neutron, stars, usually, falls, within, the, range, of, 10, 22, to, 10, 9, s, s, 1, with, the, shorter, period, or, faster, rotating, observable, neutron, stars, usually, having, smaller, p, dot, as, a, neutron, star, ages, its, rotation, slows, as, p, increases, eventually, the, rate, of, rotation, will, become, too, slow, to, power, the, radio, emission, mechanism, and, the, neutron, star, can, no, longer, be, detected, p, and, p, dot, allow, minimum, magnetic, fields, of, neutron, stars, to, be, estimated, p, and, p, dot, can, be, also, used, to, calculate, the, characteristic, age, of, a, pulsar, but, gives, an, estimate, which, is, somewhat, larger, than, the, true, age, when, it, is, applied, to, young, pulsars, p, and, p, dot, can, also, be, combined, with, neutron, star, s, moment, of, inertia, to, estimate, a, quantity, called, spin, down, luminosity, which, is, given, the, symbol, e, displaystyle, dot, e, e, dot, it, is, not, the, measured, luminosity, but, rather, the, calculated, loss, rate, of, rotational, energy, that, would, manifest, itself, as, radiation, for, neutron, stars, where, the, spin, down, luminosity, is, comparable, to, the, actual, luminosity, the, neutron, stars, are, said, to, be, rotation, powered, the, observed, luminosity, of, the, crab, pulsar, is, comparable, to, the, spin, down, luminosity, supporting, the, model, that, rotational, kinetic, energy, powers, the, radiation, from, it, with, neutron, stars, such, as, magnetars, where, the, actual, luminosity, exceeds, the, spin, down, luminosity, by, about, a, factor, of, one, hundred, it, is, assumed, that, the, luminosity, is, powered, by, magnetic, dissipation, rather, than, being, rotation, powered, p, and, p, dot, can, also, be, plotted, for, neutron, stars, to, create, a, p, p, dot, diagram, it, encodes, a, tremendous, amount, of, information, about, the, pulsar, population, and, its, properties, and, has, been, likened, to, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, in, its, importance, for, neutron, stars, neutron, star, rotational, speeds, can, increase, a, process, known, as, spin, up, sometimes, neutron, stars, absorb, orbiting, matter, from, companion, stars, increasing, the, rotation, rate, and, reshaping, the, neutron, star, into, an, oblate, spheroid, this, causes, an, increase, in, the, rate, of, rotation, of, the, neutron, star, of, over, a, hundred, times, per, second, in, the, case, of, millisecond, pulsars, the, most, rapidly, rotating, neutron, star, currently, known, psr, j1748, 2446ad, rotates, at, 716, revolutions, per, second, a, 2007, paper, reported, the, detection, of, an, x, ray, burst, oscillation, which, provides, an, indirect, measure, of, spin, of, 1122, hz, from, the, neutron, star, xte, j1739, 285, suggesting, 1122, rotations, a, second, however, at, present, this, signal, has, only, been, seen, once, and, should, be, regarded, as, tentative, until, confirmed, in, another, burst, from, that, star, sometimes, a, neutron, star, will, undergo, a, glitch, a, sudden, small, increase, of, its, rotational, speed, or, spin, up, glitches, are, thought, to, be, the, effect, of, a, starquake, as, the, rotation, of, the, neutron, star, slows, its, shape, becomes, more, spherical, due, to, the, stiffness, of, the, neutron, crust, this, happens, as, discrete, events, when, the, crust, ruptures, creating, a, starquake, similar, to, earthquakes, after, the, starquake, the, star, will, have, a, smaller, equatorial, radius, and, because, angular, momentum, is, conserved, its, rotational, speed, has, increased, starquakes, occurring, in, magnetars, with, a, resulting, glitch, is, the, leading, hypothesis, for, the, gamma, ray, sources, known, as, soft, gamma, repeaters, recent, work, however, suggests, that, a, starquake, would, not, release, sufficient, energy, for, a, neutron, star, glitch, it, has, been, suggested, that, glitches, may, instead, be, caused, by, transitions, of, vortices, in, the, theoretical, superfluid, core, of, the, neutron, star, from, one, metastable, energy, state, to, a, lower, one, thereby, releasing, energy, that, appears, as, an, increase, in, the, rotation, rate, an, anti, glitch, a, sudden, small, decrease, in, rotational, speed, or, spin, down, of, a, neutron, star, has, also, been, reported, it, occurred, in, the, magnetar, 1e, 2259, 586, that, in, one, case, produced, an, x, ray, luminosity, increase, of, a, factor, of, 20, and, a, significant, spin, down, rate, change, current, neutron, star, models, do, not, predict, this, behavior, if, the, cause, were, internal, this, suggests, differential, rotation, of, the, solid, outer, crust, and, the, superfluid, component, of, the, magnetar, s, inner, structure, at, present, there, are, about, 3, 200, known, neutron, stars, in, the, milky, way, and, the, magellanic, clouds, the, majority, of, which, have, been, detected, as, radio, pulsars, neutron, stars, are, mostly, concentrated, along, the, disk, of, the, milky, way, although, the, spread, perpendicular, to, the, disk, is, large, because, the, supernova, explosion, process, can, impart, high, translational, speeds, 400, km, s, to, the, newly, formed, neutron, star, some, of, the, closest, known, neutron, stars, are, rx, j1856, 5, 3754, which, is, about, 400, light, years, from, earth, and, psr, j0108, 1431, about, 424, light, years, rx, j1856, 5, 3754, is, a, member, of, a, close, group, of, neutron, stars, called, the, magnificent, seven, another, nearby, neutron, star, that, was, detected, transiting, the, backdrop, of, the, constellation, ursa, minor, has, been, nicknamed, calvera, by, its, canadian, and, american, discoverers, after, the, villain, in, the, 1960, film, the, magnificent, seven, this, rapidly, moving, object, was, discovered, using, the, rosat, bright, source, catalog, neutron, stars, are, only, detectable, with, modern, technology, during, the, earliest, stages, of, their, lives, almost, always, less, than, 1, million, years, and, are, vastly, outnumbered, by, older, neutron, stars, that, would, only, be, detectable, through, their, blackbody, radiation, and, gravitational, effects, on, other, stars, about, 5, of, all, known, neutron, stars, are, members, of, a, binary, system, the, formation, and, evolution, of, binary, neutron, stars, and, double, neutron, stars, can, be, a, complex, process, neutron, stars, have, been, observed, in, binaries, with, ordinary, main, sequence, stars, red, giants, white, dwarfs, or, other, neutron, stars, according, to, modern, theories, of, binary, evolution, it, is, expected, that, neutron, stars, also, exist, in, binary, systems, with, black, hole, companions, the, merger, of, binaries, containing, two, neutron, stars, or, a, neutron, star, and, a, black, hole, has, been, observed, through, the, emission, of, gravitational, waves, binary, systems, containing, neutron, stars, often, emit, x, rays, which, are, emitted, by, hot, gas, as, it, falls, towards, the, surface, of, the, neutron, star, the, source, of, the, gas, is, the, companion, star, the, outer, layers, of, which, can, be, stripped, off, by, the, gravitational, force, of, the, neutron, star, if, the, two, stars, are, sufficiently, close, as, the, neutron, star, accretes, this, gas, its, mass, can, increase, if, enough, mass, is, accreted, the, neutron, star, may, collapse, into, a, black, hole, the, distance, between, two, neutron, stars, in, a, close, binary, system, is, observed, to, shrink, as, gravitational, waves, are, emitted, ultimately, the, neutron, stars, will, come, into, contact, and, coalesce, the, coalescence, of, binary, neutron, stars, is, one, of, the, leading, models, for, the, origin, of, short, gamma, ray, bursts, strong, evidence, for, this, model, came, from, the, observation, of, a, kilonova, associated, with, the, short, duration, gamma, ray, burst, grb, 130603b, and, was, finally, confirmed, by, detection, of, gravitational, wave, gw170817, and, short, grb, 170817a, by, ligo, virgo, and, 70, observatories, covering, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, observing, the, event, the, light, emitted, in, the, kilonova, is, believed, to, come, from, the, radioactive, decay, of, material, ejected, in, the, merger, of, the, two, neutron, stars, the, merger, momentarily, creates, an, environment, of, such, extreme, neutron, flux, that, the, r, process, can, occur, this, as, opposed, to, supernova, nucleosynthesis, may, be, responsible, for, the, production, of, around, half, the, isotopes, in, chemical, elements, beyond, iron, neutron, stars, can, host, exoplanets, these, can, be, original, circumbinary, captured, or, the, result, of, a, second, round, of, planet, formation, pulsars, can, also, strip, the, atmosphere, off, from, a, star, leaving, a, planetary, mass, remnant, which, may, be, understood, as, a, chthonian, planet, or, a, stellar, object, depending, on, interpretation, for, pulsars, such, pulsar, planets, can, be, detected, with, the, pulsar, timing, method, which, allows, for, high, precision, and, detection, of, much, smaller, planets, than, with, other, methods, two, systems, have, been, definitively, confirmed, the, first, exoplanets, ever, to, be, detected, were, the, three, planets, draugr, poltergeist, and, phobetor, around, psr, b1257, 12, discovered, in, 1992, 1994, of, these, draugr, is, the, smallest, exoplanet, ever, detected, at, a, mass, of, twice, that, of, the, moon, another, system, is, psr, b1620, 26, where, a, circumbinary, planet, orbits, a, neutron, star, white, dwarf, binary, system, also, there, are, several, unconfirmed, candidates, pulsar, planets, receive, little, visible, light, but, massive, amounts, of, ionizing, radiation, and, high, energy, stellar, wind, which, makes, them, rather, hostile, environments, to, life, as, presently, understood, at, the, meeting, of, the, american, physical, society, in, december, 1933, the, proceedings, were, published, in, january, 1934, walter, baade, and, fritz, zwicky, proposed, the, existence, of, neutron, stars, less, than, two, years, after, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, by, james, chadwick, in, seeking, an, explanation, for, the, origin, of, a, supernova, they, tentatively, proposed, that, in, supernova, explosions, ordinary, stars, are, turned, into, stars, that, consist, of, extremely, closely, packed, neutrons, that, they, called, neutron, stars, baade, and, zwicky, correctly, proposed, at, that, time, that, the, release, of, the, gravitational, binding, energy, of, the, neutron, stars, powers, the, supernova, in, the, supernova, process, mass, in, bulk, is, annihilated, neutron, stars, were, thought, to, be, too, faint, to, be, detectable, and, little, work, was, done, on, them, until, november, 1967, when, franco, pacini, pointed, out, that, if, the, neutron, stars, were, spinning, and, had, large, magnetic, fields, then, electromagnetic, waves, would, be, emitted, unknown, to, him, radio, astronomer, antony, hewish, and, his, graduate, student, jocelyn, bell, at, cambridge, were, shortly, to, detect, radio, pulses, from, stars, that, are, now, believed, to, be, highly, magnetized, rapidly, spinning, neutron, stars, known, as, pulsars, in, 1965, antony, hewish, and, samuel, okoye, discovered, an, unusual, source, of, high, radio, brightness, temperature, in, the, crab, nebula, this, source, turned, out, to, be, the, crab, pulsar, that, resulted, from, the, great, supernova, of, 1054, in, 1967, iosif, shklovsky, examined, the, x, ray, and, optical, observations, of, scorpius, x, 1, and, correctly, concluded, that, the, radiation, comes, from, a, neutron, star, at, the, stage, of, accretion, in, 1967, jocelyn, bell, burnell, and, antony, hewish, discovered, regular, radio, pulses, from, psr, b1919, 21, this, pulsar, was, later, interpreted, as, an, isolated, rotating, neutron, star, the, energy, source, of, the, pulsar, is, the, rotational, energy, of, the, neutron, star, the, majority, of, known, neutron, stars, about, 2000, as, of, 2010, have, been, discovered, as, pulsars, emitting, regular, radio, pulses, in, 1968, richard, v, e, lovelace, and, collaborators, discovered, period, p, 33, displaystyle, p, approx, 33, ms, of, the, crab, pulsar, using, arecibo, observatory, after, this, discovery, scientists, concluded, that, pulsars, were, rotating, neutron, stars, before, that, many, scientists, believed, that, pulsars, were, pulsating, white, dwarfs, in, 1971, riccardo, giacconi, herbert, gursky, ed, kellogg, r, levinson, e, schreier, and, h, tananbaum, discovered, 4, 8, second, pulsations, in, an, x, ray, source, in, the, constellation, centaurus, cen, x, 3, they, interpreted, this, as, resulting, from, a, rotating, hot, neutron, star, the, energy, source, is, gravitational, and, results, from, a, rain, of, gas, falling, onto, the, surface, of, the, neutron, star, from, a, companion, star, or, the, interstellar, medium, in, 1974, antony, hewish, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, decisive, role, in, the, discovery, of, pulsars, without, jocelyn, bell, who, shared, in, the, discovery, in, 1974, joseph, taylor, and, russell, hulse, discovered, the, first, binary, pulsar, psr, b1913, 16, which, consists, of, two, neutron, stars, one, seen, as, a, pulsar, orbiting, around, their, center, of, mass, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, predicts, that, massive, objects, in, short, binary, orbits, should, emit, gravitational, waves, and, thus, that, their, orbit, should, decay, with, time, this, was, indeed, observed, precisely, as, general, relativity, predicts, and, in, 1993, taylor, and, hulse, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, this, discovery, in, 1982, don, backer, and, colleagues, discovered, the, first, millisecond, pulsar, psr, b1937, 21, this, object, spins, 642, times, per, second, a, value, that, placed, fundamental, constraints, on, the, mass, and, radius, of, neutron, stars, many, millisecond, pulsars, were, later, discovered, but, psr, b1937, 21, remained, the, fastest, spinning, known, pulsar, for, 24, years, until, psr, j1748, 2446ad, which, spins, 716, times, a, second, was, discovered, in, 2003, marta, burgay, and, colleagues, discovered, the, first, double, neutron, star, system, where, both, components, are, detectable, as, pulsars, psr, j0737, 3039, the, discovery, of, this, system, allows, a, total, of, 5, different, tests, of, general, relativity, some, of, these, with, unprecedented, precision, in, 2010, paul, demorest, and, colleagues, measured, the, mass, of, the, millisecond, pulsar, psr, j1614, 2230, to, be, 1, 97, 0, 04, m, using, shapiro, delay, this, was, substantially, higher, than, any, previously, measured, neutron, star, mass, 1, 67, m, see, psr, j1903, 0327, and, places, strong, constraints, on, the, interior, composition, of, neutron, stars, in, 2013, john, antoniadis, and, colleagues, measured, the, mass, of, psr, j0348, 0432, to, be, 2, 01, 0, 04, m, using, white, dwarf, spectroscopy, this, confirmed, the, existence, of, such, massive, stars, using, a, different, method, furthermore, this, allowed, for, the, first, time, a, test, of, general, relativity, using, such, a, massive, neutron, star, in, august, 2017, ligo, and, virgo, made, first, detection, of, gravitational, waves, produced, by, colliding, neutron, stars, gw170817, leading, to, further, discoveries, about, neutron, stars, in, october, 2018, astronomers, reported, that, grb, 150101b, a, gamma, ray, burst, event, detected, in, 2015, may, be, directly, related, to, the, historic, gw170817, and, associated, with, the, merger, of, two, neutron, stars, the, similarities, between, the, two, events, in, terms, of, gamma, ray, optical, and, x, ray, emissions, as, well, as, to, the, nature, of, the, associated, host, galaxies, are, striking, suggesting, the, two, separate, events, may, both, be, the, result, of, the, merger, of, neutron, stars, and, both, may, be, a, kilonova, which, may, be, more, common, in, the, universe, than, previously, understood, according, to, the, researchers, in, july, 2019, astronomers, reported, that, a, new, method, to, determine, the, hubble, constant, and, resolve, the, discrepancy, of, earlier, methods, has, been, proposed, based, on, the, mergers, of, pairs, of, neutron, stars, following, the, detection, of, the, neutron, star, merger, of, gw170817, their, measurement, of, the, hubble, constant, is, 70, 3, 5, 3, 5, 0, km, s, mpc, a, 2020, study, by, university, of, southampton, phd, student, fabian, gittins, suggested, that, surface, irregularities, mountains, may, only, be, fractions, of, a, millimeter, tall, about, 0, 000003, of, the, neutron, star, s, diameter, hundreds, of, times, smaller, than, previously, predicted, a, result, bearing, implications, for, the, non, detection, of, gravitational, waves, from, spinning, neutron, stars, using, the, jwst, astronomers, have, identified, a, neutron, star, within, the, remnants, of, the, supernova, 1987a, stellar, explosion, after, seeking, to, do, so, for, 37, years, according, to, a, 23, february, 2024, science, article, in, a, paradigm, shift, new, jwst, data, provides, the, elusive, direct, confirmation, of, neutron, stars, within, supernova, remnants, as, well, as, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, processes, at, play, within, sn, 1987a, s, remnants, there, are, a, number, of, types, of, object, that, consist, of, or, contain, a, neutron, star, there, are, also, a, number, of, theorized, compact, stars, with, similar, properties, that, are, not, actually, neutron, stars
