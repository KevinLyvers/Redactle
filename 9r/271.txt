the, solar, wind, is, a, stream, of, charged, particles, released, from, the, sun, s, outermost, atmospheric, layer, the, corona, this, plasma, mostly, consists, of, electrons, protons, and, alpha, particles, with, kinetic, energy, between, 0, 5, and, 10, kev, the, composition, of, the, solar, wind, plasma, also, includes, a, mixture, of, particle, species, found, in, the, solar, plasma, trace, amounts, of, heavy, ions, and, atomic, nuclei, of, elements, such, as, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and, iron, there, are, also, rarer, traces, of, some, other, nuclei, and, isotopes, such, as, phosphorus, titanium, chromium, and, nickel, s, isotopes, 58, ni, 60, ni, and, 62, ni, superimposed, with, the, solar, wind, plasma, is, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, the, solar, wind, varies, in, density, temperature, and, speed, over, time, and, over, solar, latitude, and, longitude, its, particles, can, escape, the, sun, s, gravity, because, of, their, high, energy, resulting, from, the, high, temperature, of, the, corona, which, in, turn, is, a, result, of, the, coronal, magnetic, field, the, boundary, separating, the, corona, from, the, solar, wind, is, called, the, alfv, n, surface, at, a, distance, of, more, than, a, few, solar, radii, from, the, sun, the, solar, wind, reaches, speeds, of, 250, 750, km, s, and, is, supersonic, meaning, it, moves, faster, than, the, speed, of, fast, magnetosonic, waves, the, flow, of, the, solar, wind, is, no, longer, supersonic, at, the, termination, shock, other, related, phenomena, include, the, aurora, northern, and, southern, lights, comet, tails, that, always, point, away, from, the, sun, and, geomagnetic, storms, that, can, change, the, direction, of, magnetic, field, lines, the, existence, of, particles, flowing, outward, from, the, sun, to, the, earth, was, first, suggested, by, british, astronomer, richard, c, carrington, in, 1859, carrington, and, richard, hodgson, independently, made, the, first, observations, of, what, would, later, be, called, a, solar, flare, this, is, a, sudden, localised, increase, in, brightness, on, the, solar, disc, which, is, now, known, to, often, occur, in, conjunction, with, an, episodic, ejection, of, material, and, magnetic, flux, from, the, sun, s, atmosphere, known, as, a, coronal, mass, ejection, the, following, day, a, powerful, geomagnetic, storm, was, observed, and, carrington, suspected, that, there, might, be, a, connection, the, geomagnetic, storm, is, now, attributed, to, the, arrival, of, the, coronal, mass, ejection, in, near, earth, space, and, its, subsequent, interaction, with, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, irish, academic, george, fitzgerald, later, suggested, that, matter, was, being, regularly, accelerated, away, from, the, sun, reaching, the, earth, after, several, days, in, 1910, british, astrophysicist, arthur, eddington, essentially, suggested, the, existence, of, the, solar, wind, without, naming, it, in, a, footnote, to, an, article, on, comet, morehouse, eddington, s, proposition, was, never, fully, embraced, even, though, he, had, also, made, a, similar, suggestion, at, a, royal, institution, address, the, previous, year, in, which, he, had, postulated, that, the, ejected, material, consisted, of, electrons, whereas, in, his, study, of, comet, morehouse, he, had, supposed, them, to, be, ions, the, idea, that, the, ejected, material, consisted, of, both, ions, and, electrons, was, first, suggested, by, norwegian, scientist, kristian, birkeland, his, geomagnetic, surveys, showed, that, auroral, activity, was, almost, uninterrupted, as, these, displays, and, other, geomagnetic, activity, were, being, produced, by, particles, from, the, sun, he, concluded, that, the, earth, was, being, continually, bombarded, by, rays, of, electric, corpuscles, emitted, by, the, sun, he, proposed, in, 1916, that, from, a, physical, point, of, view, it, is, most, probable, that, solar, rays, are, neither, exclusively, negative, nor, positive, rays, but, of, both, kinds, in, other, words, the, solar, wind, consists, of, both, negative, electrons, and, positive, ions, three, years, later, in, 1919, british, physicist, frederick, lindemann, also, suggested, that, the, sun, ejects, particles, of, both, polarities, protons, as, well, as, electrons, around, the, 1930s, scientists, had, concluded, that, the, temperature, of, the, solar, corona, must, be, a, million, degrees, celsius, because, of, the, way, it, extended, into, space, as, seen, during, a, total, solar, eclipse, later, spectroscopic, work, confirmed, this, extraordinary, temperature, to, be, the, case, in, the, mid, 1950s, british, mathematician, sydney, chapman, calculated, the, properties, of, a, gas, at, such, a, temperature, and, determined, that, the, corona, being, such, a, superb, conductor, of, heat, it, must, extend, way, out, into, space, beyond, the, orbit, of, earth, also, in, the, 1950s, german, astronomer, ludwig, biermann, became, interested, in, the, fact, that, the, tail, of, a, comet, always, points, away, from, the, sun, regardless, of, the, direction, in, which, the, comet, is, travelling, biermann, postulated, that, this, happens, because, the, sun, emits, a, steady, stream, of, particles, that, pushes, the, comet, s, tail, away, german, astronomer, paul, ahnert, is, credited, by, wilfried, schr, der, as, being, the, first, to, relate, solar, wind, to, the, direction, of, a, comet, s, tail, based, on, observations, of, the, comet, whipple, fedke, 1942g, american, astrophysicist, eugene, parker, realised, that, heat, flowing, from, the, sun, in, chapman, s, model, and, the, comet, tail, blowing, away, from, the, sun, in, biermann, s, hypothesis, had, to, be, the, result, of, the, same, phenomenon, which, he, termed, the, solar, wind, in, 1957, parker, showed, that, although, the, sun, s, corona, is, strongly, attracted, by, solar, gravity, it, is, such, a, good, conductor, of, heat, that, it, is, still, very, hot, at, large, distances, from, the, sun, as, solar, gravity, weakens, with, increasing, distance, from, the, sun, the, outer, coronal, atmosphere, is, able, to, escape, supersonically, into, interstellar, space, parker, was, also, the, first, person, to, notice, that, the, weakening, influence, of, the, sun, s, gravity, has, the, same, effect, on, hydrodynamic, flow, as, a, de, laval, nozzle, inciting, a, transition, from, subsonic, to, supersonic, flow, there, was, strong, opposition, to, parker, s, hypothesis, on, the, solar, wind, the, paper, he, submitted, to, the, astrophysical, journal, in, 1958, was, rejected, by, two, reviewers, before, being, accepted, by, the, editor, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, in, january, 1959, the, soviet, spacecraft, luna, 1, first, directly, observed, the, solar, wind, and, measured, its, strength, using, hemispherical, ion, traps, the, discovery, made, by, konstantin, gringauz, was, verified, by, luna, 2, luna, 3, and, the, more, distant, measurements, of, venera, 1, three, years, later, a, similar, measurement, was, performed, by, american, geophysicist, marcia, neugebauer, and, collaborators, using, the, mariner, 2, spacecraft, the, first, numerical, simulation, of, the, solar, wind, in, the, solar, corona, including, closed, and, open, field, lines, was, performed, by, pneuman, and, kopp, in, 1971, the, magnetohydrodynamics, equations, in, steady, state, were, solved, iteratively, starting, with, an, initial, dipolar, configuration, in, 1990, the, ulysses, probe, was, launched, to, study, the, solar, wind, from, high, solar, latitudes, all, prior, observations, had, been, made, at, or, near, the, solar, system, s, ecliptic, plane, in, the, late, 1990s, the, ultraviolet, coronal, spectrometer, uvcs, instrument, on, board, the, soho, spacecraft, observed, the, acceleration, region, of, the, fast, solar, wind, emanating, from, the, poles, of, the, sun, and, found, that, the, wind, accelerates, much, faster, than, can, be, accounted, for, by, thermodynamic, expansion, alone, parker, s, model, predicted, that, the, wind, should, make, the, transition, to, supersonic, flow, at, an, altitude, of, about, four, solar, radii, approx, 3, 000, 000, km, from, the, photosphere, surface, but, the, transition, or, sonic, point, now, appears, to, be, much, lower, perhaps, only, one, solar, radius, approx, 700, 000, km, above, the, photosphere, suggesting, that, some, additional, mechanism, accelerates, the, solar, wind, away, from, the, sun, the, acceleration, of, the, fast, wind, is, still, not, understood, and, cannot, be, fully, explained, by, parker, s, theory, however, the, gravitational, and, electromagnetic, explanation, for, this, acceleration, is, detailed, in, an, earlier, paper, by, 1970, nobel, laureate, in, physics, hannes, alfv, n, from, may, 10, to, may, 12, 1999, nasa, s, advanced, composition, explorer, ace, and, wind, spacecraft, observed, a, 98, decrease, of, solar, wind, density, this, allowed, energetic, electrons, from, the, sun, to, flow, to, earth, in, narrow, beams, known, as, strahl, which, caused, a, highly, unusual, polar, rain, event, in, which, a, visible, aurora, appeared, over, the, north, pole, in, addition, earth, s, magnetosphere, increased, to, between, 5, and, 6, times, its, normal, size, the, stereo, mission, was, launched, in, 2006, to, study, coronal, mass, ejections, and, the, solar, corona, using, stereoscopy, from, two, widely, separated, imaging, systems, each, stereo, spacecraft, carried, two, heliospheric, imagers, highly, sensitive, wide, field, cameras, capable, of, imaging, the, solar, wind, itself, via, thomson, scattering, of, sunlight, off, of, free, electrons, movies, from, stereo, revealed, the, solar, wind, near, the, ecliptic, as, a, large, scale, turbulent, flow, on, december, 13, 2010, voyager, 1, determined, that, the, velocity, of, the, solar, wind, at, its, location, 10, 8, billion, miles, 17, 4, billion, kilometres, from, earth, had, slowed, to, zero, we, have, gotten, to, the, point, where, the, wind, from, the, sun, which, until, now, has, always, had, an, outward, motion, is, no, longer, moving, outward, it, is, only, moving, sideways, so, that, it, can, end, up, going, down, the, tail, of, the, heliosphere, which, is, a, comet, shaped, like, object, said, voyager, project, scientist, edward, stone, in, 2018, nasa, launched, the, parker, solar, probe, named, in, honor, of, american, astrophysicist, eugene, parker, on, a, mission, to, study, the, structure, and, dynamics, of, the, solar, corona, in, an, attempt, to, understand, the, mechanisms, that, cause, particles, to, be, heated, and, accelerated, as, solar, wind, during, its, seven, year, mission, the, probe, will, make, twenty, four, orbits, of, the, sun, passing, further, into, the, corona, with, each, orbit, s, perihelion, ultimately, passing, within, 0, 04, astronomical, units, of, the, sun, s, surface, it, is, the, first, nasa, spacecraft, named, for, a, living, person, and, parker, at, age, 91, was, on, hand, to, observe, the, launch, while, early, models, of, the, solar, wind, relied, primarily, on, thermal, energy, to, accelerate, the, material, by, the, 1960s, it, was, clear, that, thermal, acceleration, alone, cannot, account, for, the, high, speed, of, solar, wind, an, additional, unknown, acceleration, mechanism, is, required, and, likely, relates, to, magnetic, fields, in, the, solar, atmosphere, the, sun, s, corona, or, extended, outer, layer, is, a, region, of, plasma, that, is, heated, to, over, a, megakelvin, as, a, result, of, thermal, collisions, the, particles, within, the, inner, corona, have, a, range, and, distribution, of, speeds, described, by, a, maxwellian, distribution, the, mean, velocity, of, these, particles, is, about, 145, km, s, which, is, well, below, the, solar, escape, velocity, of, 618, km, s, however, a, few, of, the, particles, achieve, energies, sufficient, to, reach, the, terminal, velocity, of, 400, km, s, which, allows, them, to, feed, the, solar, wind, at, the, same, temperature, electrons, due, to, their, much, smaller, mass, reach, escape, velocity, and, build, up, an, electric, field, that, further, accelerates, ions, away, from, the, sun, the, total, number, of, particles, carried, away, from, the, sun, by, the, solar, wind, is, about, 1, 3, 10, 36, per, second, thus, the, total, mass, loss, each, year, is, about, 2, 3, 10, 14, solar, masses, or, about, 1, 3, 1, 9, million, tonnes, per, second, this, is, equivalent, to, losing, a, mass, equal, to, the, earth, every, 150, million, years, however, since, the, sun, s, formation, only, about, 0, 01, of, its, initial, mass, has, been, lost, through, the, solar, wind, other, stars, have, much, stronger, stellar, winds, that, result, in, significantly, higher, mass, loss, rates, in, march, 2023, solar, extreme, ultraviolet, observations, have, shown, that, small, scale, magnetic, reconnection, could, be, a, driver, of, the, solar, wind, as, a, swarm, of, nanoflares, in, the, form, omnipresent, jetting, activity, a, k, a, jetlets, producing, short, lived, streams, of, hot, plasma, and, alfv, n, waves, at, the, base, of, the, solar, corona, this, activity, could, also, be, connected, to, the, magnetic, switchback, phenomenon, of, the, solar, wind, the, solar, wind, is, observed, to, exist, in, two, fundamental, states, termed, the, slow, solar, wind, and, the, fast, solar, wind, though, their, differences, extend, well, beyond, their, speeds, in, near, earth, space, the, slow, solar, wind, is, observed, to, have, a, velocity, of, 300, 500, km, s, a, temperature, of, 100, kilokelvin, and, a, composition, that, is, a, close, match, to, the, corona, by, contrast, the, fast, solar, wind, has, a, typical, velocity, of, 750, km, s, a, temperature, of, 800, kilokelvin, and, it, nearly, matches, the, composition, of, the, sun, s, photosphere, the, slow, solar, wind, is, twice, as, dense, and, more, variable, in, nature, than, the, fast, solar, wind, the, slow, solar, wind, appears, to, originate, from, a, region, around, the, sun, s, equatorial, belt, that, is, known, as, the, streamer, belt, where, coronal, streamers, are, produced, by, magnetic, flux, open, to, the, heliosphere, draping, over, closed, magnetic, loops, the, exact, coronal, structures, involved, in, slow, solar, wind, formation, and, the, method, by, which, the, material, is, released, is, still, under, debate, observations, of, the, sun, between, 1996, and, 2001, showed, that, emission, of, the, slow, solar, wind, occurred, at, latitudes, up, to, 30, 35, during, the, solar, minimum, the, period, of, lowest, solar, activity, then, expanded, toward, the, poles, as, the, solar, cycle, approached, maximum, at, solar, maximum, the, poles, were, also, emitting, a, slow, solar, wind, the, fast, solar, wind, originates, from, coronal, holes, which, are, funnel, like, regions, of, open, field, lines, in, the, sun, s, magnetic, field, such, open, lines, are, particularly, prevalent, around, the, sun, s, magnetic, poles, the, plasma, source, is, small, magnetic, fields, created, by, convection, cells, in, the, solar, atmosphere, these, fields, confine, the, plasma, and, transport, it, into, the, narrow, necks, of, the, coronal, funnels, which, are, located, only, 20, 000, km, above, the, photosphere, the, plasma, is, released, into, the, funnel, when, these, magnetic, field, lines, reconnect, near, the, earth, s, orbit, at, 1, astronomical, unit, au, the, plasma, flows, at, speeds, ranging, from, 250, to, 750, km, s, with, a, density, ranging, between, 3, and, 10, particles, per, cubic, centimeter, and, temperature, ranging, from, 10, 4, to, 10, 6, kelvin, on, average, the, plasma, density, decreases, with, the, square, of, the, distance, from, the, sun, sect, 2, 4, while, the, velocity, decreases, and, flattens, out, at, 1, au, fig, 5, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, reported, plasma, density, n, between, 0, 001, and, 0, 005, particles, cm, 3, at, distances, of, 80, to, 120, au, increasing, rapidly, beyond, 120, au, at, heliopause, to, between, 0, 05, and, 0, 2, particles, cm, 3, at, 1, au, the, wind, exerts, a, pressure, typically, in, the, range, of, 1, 6, npa, 1, 6, 10, 9, n, m, 2, although, it, can, readily, vary, outside, that, range, the, ram, pressure, is, a, function, of, wind, speed, and, density, the, formula, is, where, m, p, is, the, proton, mass, pressure, p, is, in, pa, pascals, n, is, the, density, in, particles, cm, 3, and, v, is, the, speed, in, km, s, of, the, solar, wind, both, the, fast, and, slow, solar, wind, can, be, interrupted, by, large, fast, moving, bursts, of, plasma, called, coronal, mass, ejections, or, cmes, cmes, are, caused, by, a, release, of, magnetic, energy, at, the, sun, cmes, are, often, called, solar, storms, or, space, storms, in, the, popular, media, they, are, sometimes, but, not, always, associated, with, solar, flares, which, are, another, manifestation, of, magnetic, energy, release, at, the, sun, cmes, cause, shock, waves, in, the, thin, plasma, of, the, heliosphere, launching, electromagnetic, waves, and, accelerating, particles, mostly, protons, and, electrons, to, form, showers, of, ionizing, radiation, that, precede, the, cme, when, a, cme, impacts, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, it, temporarily, deforms, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, changing, the, direction, of, compass, needles, and, inducing, large, electrical, ground, currents, in, earth, itself, this, is, called, a, geomagnetic, storm, and, it, is, a, global, phenomenon, cme, impacts, can, induce, magnetic, reconnection, in, earth, s, magnetotail, the, midnight, side, of, the, magnetosphere, this, launches, protons, and, electrons, downward, toward, earth, s, atmosphere, where, they, form, the, aurora, cmes, are, not, the, only, cause, of, space, weather, different, patches, on, the, sun, are, known, to, give, rise, to, slightly, different, speeds, and, densities, of, wind, depending, on, local, conditions, in, isolation, each, of, these, different, wind, streams, would, form, a, spiral, with, a, slightly, different, angle, with, fast, moving, streams, moving, out, more, directly, and, slow, moving, streams, wrapping, more, around, the, sun, fast, moving, streams, tend, to, overtake, slower, streams, that, originate, westward, of, them, on, the, sun, forming, turbulent, co, rotating, interaction, regions, that, give, rise, to, wave, motions, and, accelerated, particles, and, that, affect, earth, s, magnetosphere, in, the, same, way, as, but, more, gently, than, cmes, cmes, have, a, complex, internal, structure, with, a, highly, turbulent, region, of, hot, and, compressed, plasma, known, as, sheath, preceding, an, arrival, of, relatively, cold, and, strongly, magnetized, plasma, region, known, as, magnetic, cloud, or, ejecta, sheath, and, ejecta, have, very, different, impact, on, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, and, on, various, space, weather, phenomena, such, as, the, behavior, of, van, allen, radiation, belts, magnetic, switchbacks, are, sudden, reversals, in, the, magnetic, field, of, the, solar, wind, they, can, also, be, described, as, traveling, disturbances, in, the, solar, wind, that, caused, the, magnetic, field, to, bend, back, on, itself, they, were, first, observed, by, the, nasa, esa, mission, ulysses, the, first, spacecraft, to, fly, over, the, sun, s, poles, parker, solar, probe, observed, first, switchbacks, in, 2018, over, the, sun, s, lifetime, the, interaction, of, its, surface, layers, with, the, escaping, solar, wind, has, significantly, decreased, its, surface, rotation, rate, the, wind, is, considered, responsible, for, comets, tails, along, with, the, sun, s, radiation, the, solar, wind, contributes, to, fluctuations, in, celestial, radio, waves, observed, on, the, earth, through, an, effect, called, interplanetary, scintillation, where, the, solar, wind, intersects, with, a, planet, that, has, a, well, developed, magnetic, field, such, as, earth, jupiter, or, saturn, the, particles, are, deflected, by, the, lorentz, force, this, region, known, as, the, magnetosphere, causes, the, particles, to, travel, around, the, planet, rather, than, bombarding, the, atmosphere, or, surface, the, magnetosphere, is, roughly, shaped, like, a, hemisphere, on, the, side, facing, the, sun, then, is, drawn, out, in, a, long, wake, on, the, opposite, side, the, boundary, of, this, region, is, called, the, magnetopause, and, some, of, the, particles, are, able, to, penetrate, the, magnetosphere, through, this, region, by, partial, reconnection, of, the, magnetic, field, lines, the, solar, wind, is, responsible, for, the, overall, shape, of, earth, s, magnetosphere, fluctuations, in, its, speed, density, direction, and, entrained, magnetic, field, strongly, affect, earth, s, local, space, environment, for, example, the, levels, of, ionizing, radiation, and, radio, interference, can, vary, by, factors, of, hundreds, to, thousands, and, the, shape, and, location, of, the, magnetopause, and, bow, shock, wave, upstream, of, it, can, change, by, several, earth, radii, exposing, geosynchronous, satellites, to, the, direct, solar, wind, these, phenomena, are, collectively, called, space, weather, from, the, european, space, agency, s, cluster, mission, a, new, study, has, taken, place, that, proposes, that, it, is, easier, for, the, solar, wind, to, infiltrate, the, magnetosphere, than, previously, believed, a, group, of, scientists, directly, observed, the, existence, of, certain, waves, in, the, solar, wind, that, were, not, expected, a, recent, study, shows, that, these, waves, enable, incoming, charged, particles, of, solar, wind, to, breach, the, magnetopause, this, suggests, that, the, magnetic, bubble, forms, more, as, a, filter, than, a, continuous, barrier, this, latest, discovery, occurred, through, the, distinctive, arrangement, of, the, four, identical, cluster, spacecraft, which, fly, in, a, controlled, configuration, through, near, earth, space, as, they, sweep, from, the, magnetosphere, into, interplanetary, space, and, back, again, the, fleet, provides, exceptional, three, dimensional, insights, on, the, phenomena, that, connect, the, sun, to, earth, the, research, characterised, variances, in, formation, of, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, imf, largely, influenced, by, kelvin, helmholtz, instability, which, occur, at, the, interface, of, two, fluids, as, a, result, of, differences, in, thickness, and, numerous, other, characteristics, of, the, boundary, layer, experts, believe, that, this, was, the, first, occasion, that, the, appearance, of, kelvin, helmholtz, waves, at, the, magnetopause, had, been, displayed, at, high, latitude, downward, orientation, of, the, imf, these, waves, are, being, seen, in, unforeseen, places, under, solar, wind, conditions, that, were, formerly, believed, to, be, undesired, for, their, generation, these, discoveries, show, how, earth, s, magnetosphere, can, be, penetrated, by, solar, particles, under, specific, imf, circumstances, the, findings, are, also, relevant, to, studies, of, magnetospheric, progressions, around, other, planetary, bodies, this, study, suggests, that, kelvin, helmholtz, waves, can, be, a, somewhat, common, and, possibly, constant, instrument, for, the, entrance, of, solar, wind, into, terrestrial, magnetospheres, under, various, imf, orientations, the, solar, wind, affects, other, incoming, cosmic, rays, interacting, with, planetary, atmospheres, moreover, planets, with, a, weak, or, non, existent, magnetosphere, are, subject, to, atmospheric, stripping, by, the, solar, wind, venus, the, nearest, and, most, similar, planet, to, earth, has, 100, times, denser, atmosphere, with, little, or, no, geo, magnetic, field, space, probes, discovered, a, comet, like, tail, that, extends, to, earth, s, orbit, earth, itself, is, largely, protected, from, the, solar, wind, by, its, magnetic, field, which, deflects, most, of, the, charged, particles, however, some, of, the, charged, particles, are, trapped, in, the, van, allen, radiation, belt, a, smaller, number, of, particles, from, the, solar, wind, manage, to, travel, as, though, on, an, electromagnetic, energy, transmission, line, to, the, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, and, ionosphere, in, the, auroral, zones, the, only, time, the, solar, wind, is, observable, on, the, earth, is, when, it, is, strong, enough, to, produce, phenomena, such, as, the, aurora, and, geomagnetic, storms, bright, auroras, strongly, heat, the, ionosphere, causing, its, plasma, to, expand, into, the, magnetosphere, increasing, the, size, of, the, plasma, geosphere, and, injecting, atmospheric, matter, into, the, solar, wind, geomagnetic, storms, result, when, the, pressure, of, plasmas, contained, inside, the, magnetosphere, is, sufficiently, large, to, inflate, and, thereby, distort, the, geomagnetic, field, although, mars, is, larger, than, mercury, and, four, times, farther, from, the, sun, it, is, thought, that, the, solar, wind, has, stripped, away, up, to, a, third, of, its,

vestigial, and, transient, its, surface, is, bathed, in, radiation, mercury, has, an, intrinsic, magnetic, field, so, under, normal, solar, wind, conditions, the, solar, wind, cannot, penetrate, its, magnetosphere, and, particles, only, reach, the, surface, in, the, cusp, regions, during, coronal, mass, ejections, however, the, magnetopause, may, get, pressed, into, the, surface, of, the, planet, and, under, these, conditions, the, solar, wind, may, interact, freely, with, the, planetary, surface, the, earth, s, moon, has, no, atmosphere, or, intrinsic, magnetic, field, and, consequently, its,

known, as, the, heliopause, and, is, often, considered, to, be, the, outer, border, of, the, solar, system, the, distance, to, the, heliopause, is, not, precisely, known, and, probably, depends, on, the, current, velocity, of, the, solar, wind, and, the, local, density, of, the, interstellar, medium, but, it, is, far, outside, pluto, s, orbit, scientists, hope, to, gain, perspective, on, the, heliopause, from, data, acquired, through, the, interstellar, boundary, explorer, ibex, mission, launched, in, october, 2008, the, heliopause, is, noted, as, one, of, the, ways, of, defining, the, extent, of, the, solar, system, along, with, the, kuiper, belt, and, the, radius, at, which, the, sun, s, gravitational, influence, is, matched, by, other, stars, the, maximum, extent, of, that,
