propylene, also, known, as, propene, is, an, unsaturated, organic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, ch, 3, ch, ch, 2, it, has, one, double, bond, and, is, the, second, simplest, member, of, the, alkene, class, of, hydrocarbons, it, is, a, colorless, gas, with, a, faint, petroleum, like, odor, propylene, is, a, product, of, combustion, from, forest, fires, cigarette, smoke, and, motor, vehicle, and, aircraft, exhaust, it, was, discovered, in, 1850, by, a, w, von, hoffman, s, student, captain, later, major, general, john, williams, reynolds, as, the, only, gaseous, product, of, thermal, decomposition, of, amyl, alcohol, to, react, with, chlorine, and, bromine, the, dominant, technology, for, producing, propylene, is, steam, cracking, using, propane, as, the, feedstock, cracking, propane, yields, a, mixture, of, ethylene, propylene, methane, hydrogen, gas, and, other, related, compounds, the, yield, of, propylene, is, about, 15, the, other, principal, feedstock, is, naphtha, especially, in, the, middle, east, and, asia, propylene, can, be, separated, by, fractional, distillation, from, the, hydrocarbon, mixtures, obtained, from, cracking, and, other, refining, processes, refinery, grade, propene, is, about, 50, to, 70, in, the, united, states, shale, gas, is, a, major, source, of, propane, in, the, phillips, triolefin, or, olefin, conversion, technology, propylene, is, interconverted, with, ethylene, and, 2, butenes, rhenium, and, molybdenum, catalysts, are, used, the, technology, is, founded, on, an, olefin, metathesis, reaction, discovered, at, phillips, petroleum, company, propylene, yields, of, about, 90, wt, are, achieved, related, is, the, methanol, to, olefins, methanol, to, propene, process, it, converts, synthesis, gas, syngas, to, methanol, and, then, converts, the, methanol, to, ethylene, and, or, propene, the, process, produces, water, as, a, by, product, synthesis, gas, is, produced, from, the, reformation, of, natural, gas, or, by, the, steam, induced, reformation, of, petroleum, products, such, as, naphtha, or, by, gasification, of, coal, or, natural, gas, high, severity, fluid, catalytic, cracking, fcc, uses, traditional, fcc, technology, under, severe, conditions, higher, catalyst, to, oil, ratios, higher, steam, injection, rates, higher, temperatures, etc, in, order, to, maximize, the, amount, of, propene, and, other, light, products, a, high, severity, fcc, unit, is, usually, fed, with, gas, oils, paraffins, and, residues, and, produces, about, 20, 25, by, mass, of, propene, on, feedstock, together, with, greater, volumes, of, motor, gasoline, and, distillate, byproducts, these, high, temperature, processes, are, expensive, and, have, a, high, carbon, footprint, for, these, reasons, alternative, routes, to, propylene, continue, to, attract, attention, on, purpose, propylene, production, technologies, were, developed, throughout, the, twentieth, century, of, these, propane, dehydrogenation, technologies, such, as, the, catofin, and, oleflex, processes, have, become, common, although, they, still, make, up, a, minority, of, the, market, with, most, of, the, olefin, being, sourced, from, the, above, mentioned, cracking, technologies, platinum, chromia, and, vanadium, catalysts, are, common, in, propane, dehydrogenation, processes, propene, production, has, remained, static, at, around, 35, million, tonnes, europe, and, north, america, only, from, 2000, to, 2008, but, it, has, been, increasing, in, east, asia, most, notably, singapore, and, china, total, world, production, of, propene, is, currently, about, half, that, of, ethylene, the, use, of, engineered, enzymes, has, been, explored, but, has, not, been, commercialized, there, is, ongoing, research, into, the, use, of, oxygen, carrier, catalysts, for, the, oxidative, dehydrogenation, of, propane, this, poses, several, advantages, as, this, reaction, mechanism, can, occur, at, lower, temperatures, than, conventional, dehydrogenation, and, may, not, be, equilibrium, limited, because, oxygen, is, used, to, combust, the, hydrogen, by, product, propene, is, the, second, most, important, starting, product, in, the, petrochemical, industry, after, ethylene, it, is, the, raw, material, for, a, wide, variety, of, products, polypropylene, manufacturers, consume, nearly, two, thirds, of, global, production, polypropylene, end, uses, include, films, fibers, containers, packaging, and, caps, and, closures, propene, is, also, used, for, the, production, of, important, chemicals, such, as, propylene, oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, butyraldehyde, and, acrylic, acid, in, the, year, 2013, about, 85, million, tonnes, of, propene, were, processed, worldwide, propene, and, benzene, are, converted, to, acetone, and, phenol, via, the, cumene, process, propene, is, also, used, to, produce, isopropyl, alcohol, propan, 2, ol, acrylonitrile, propylene, oxide, and, epichlorohydrin, the, industrial, production, of, acrylic, acid, involves, the, catalytic, partial, oxidation, of, propene, propylene, is, an, intermediate, in, the, oxidation, to, acrylic, acid, in, industry, and, workshops, propene, is, used, as, an, alternative, fuel, to, acetylene, in, oxy, fuel, welding, and, cutting, brazing, and, heating, of, metal, for, the, purpose, of, bending, it, has, become, a, standard, in, bernzomatic, products, and, others, in, mapp, substitutes, now, that, true, mapp, gas, is, no, longer, available, propene, resembles, other, alkenes, in, that, it, undergoes, addition, reactions, relatively, easily, at, room, temperature, the, relative, weakness, of, its, double, bond, explains, its, tendency, to, react, with, substances, that, can, achieve, this, transformation, alkene, reactions, include, 1, polymerization, 2, oxidation, 3, halogenation, and, hydrohalogenation, 4, alkylation, 5, hydration, 6, oligomerization, and, 7, hydroformylation, foundational, to, hydroformylation, alkene, metathesis, and, polymerization, are, metal, propylene, complexes, which, are, intermediates, in, these, processes, propylene, is, prochiral, meaning, that, binding, of, a, reagent, such, as, a, metal, electrophile, to, the, c, c, group, yields, one, of, two, enantiomers, the, majority, of, propene, is, used, to, form, polypropylene, a, very, important, commodity, thermoplastic, through, chain, growth, polymerization, in, the, presence, of, a, suitable, catalyst, typically, a, ziegler, natta, catalyst, propene, will, polymerize, there, are, multiple, ways, to, achieve, this, such, as, using, high, pressures, to, suspending, the, catalyst, in, a, solution, of, liquid, propene, or, running, gaseous, propene, through, a, fluidized, bed, reactor, in, the, presence, of, catalysts, propylene, dimerizes, to, give, 2, 3, dimethyl, 1, butene, and, or, 2, 3, dimethyl, 2, butene, propene, is, a, product, of, combustion, from, forest, fires, cigarette, smoke, and, motor, vehicle, and, aircraft, exhaust, it, is, an, impurity, in, some, heating, gases, observed, concentrations, have, been, in, the, range, of, 0, 1, 4, 8, parts, per, billion, ppb, in, rural, air, 4, 10, 5, ppb, in, urban, air, and, 7, 260, ppb, in, industrial, air, samples, in, the, united, states, and, some, european, countries, a, threshold, limit, value, of, 500, parts, per, million, ppm, was, established, for, occupational, 8, hour, time, weighted, average, exposure, it, is, considered, a, volatile, organic, compound, voc, and, emissions, are, regulated, by, many, governments, but, it, is, not, listed, by, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, epa, as, a, hazardous, air, pollutant, under, the, clean, air, act, with, a, relatively, short, half, life, it, is, not, expected, to, bioaccumulate, propene, has, low, acute, toxicity, from, inhalation, and, is, not, considered, to, be, carcinogenic, chronic, toxicity, studies, in, mice, did, not, yield, significant, evidence, suggesting, adverse, effects, humans, briefly, exposed, to, 4, 000, ppm, did, not, experience, any, noticeable, effects, propene, is, dangerous, from, its, potential, to, displace, oxygen, as, an, asphyxiant, gas, and, from, its, high, flammability, explosion, risk, bio, propylene, is, the, bio, based, propylene, it, has, been, examined, motivated, by, diverse, interests, such, a, carbon, footprint, production, from, glucose, has, been, considered, more, advanced, ways, of, addressing, such, issues, focus, on, electrification, alternatives, to, steam, cracking, propene, is, flammable, propene, is, usually, stored, as, liquid, under, pressure, although, it, is, also, possible, to, store, it, safely, as, gas, at, ambient, temperature, in, approved, containers, propene, is, detected, in, the, interstellar, medium, through, microwave, spectroscopy, on, september, 30, 2013, nasa, also, announced, that, the, cassini, orbiter, spacecraft, part, of, the, cassini, huygens,
