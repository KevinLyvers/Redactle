sodium, carbonate, also, known, as, washing, soda, soda, ash, and, soda, crystals, is, the, inorganic, compound, with, the, formula, na, 2, co, 3, and, its, various, hydrates, all, forms, are, white, odourless, water, soluble, salts, that, yield, alkaline, solutions, in, water, historically, it, was, extracted, from, the, ashes, of, plants, grown, in, sodium, rich, soils, and, because, the, ashes, of, these, sodium, rich, plants, were, noticeably, different, from, ashes, of, wood, once, used, to, produce, potash, sodium, carbonate, became, known, as, soda, ash, it, is, produced, in, large, quantities, from, sodium, chloride, and, limestone, by, the, solvay, process, as, well, as, by, carbonating, sodium, hydroxide, which, is, made, using, the, chloralkali, process, sodium, carbonate, is, obtained, as, three, hydrates, and, as, the, anhydrous, salt, the, decahydrate, is, formed, from, water, solutions, crystallizing, in, the, temperature, range, 2, 1, to, 32, 0, c, the, heptahydrate, in, the, narrow, range, 32, 0, to, 35, 4, c, and, above, this, temperature, the, monohydrate, forms, in, dry, air, the, decahydrate, and, heptahydrate, lose, water, to, give, the, monohydrate, other, hydrates, have, been, reported, e, g, with, 2, 5, units, of, water, per, sodium, carbonate, unit, penta, hemihydrate, sodium, carbonate, decahydrate, na, 2, co, 3, 10h, 2, o, also, known, as, washing, soda, is, the, most, common, hydrate, of, sodium, carbonate, containing, 10, molecules, of, water, of, crystallization, soda, ash, is, dissolved, in, water, and, crystallized, to, get, washing, soda, na, 2, co, 3, 10, h, 2, o, na, 2, co, 3, 10, h, 2, o, displaystyle, ce, na2co3, 10h2o, na2co3, 10h2o, it, is, one, of, the, few, metal, carbonates, that, is, soluble, in, water, some, common, applications, of, sodium, carbonate, include, sodium, carbonate, serves, as, a, flux, for, silica, sio, 2, melting, point, 1, 713, c, lowering, the, melting, point, of, the, mixture, to, something, achievable, without, special, materials, this, soda, glass, is, mildly, water, soluble, so, some, calcium, carbonate, is, added, to, the, melt, mixture, to, make, the, glass, insoluble, bottle, and, window, glass, soda, lime, glass, with, transition, temperature, 570, c, is, made, by, melting, such, mixtures, of, sodium, carbonate, calcium, carbonate, and, silica, sand, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, when, these, materials, are, heated, the, carbonates, release, carbon, dioxide, in, this, way, sodium, carbonate, is, a, source, of, sodium, oxide, soda, lime, glass, has, been, the, most, common, form, of, glass, for, centuries, it, is, also, a, key, input, for, tableware, glass, manufacturing, hard, water, usually, contains, calcium, or, magnesium, ions, sodium, carbonate, is, used, for, removing, these, ions, and, replacing, them, with, sodium, ions, sodium, carbonate, is, a, water, soluble, source, of, carbonate, the, calcium, and, magnesium, ions, form, insoluble, solid, precipitates, upon, treatment, with, carbonate, ions, the, water, is, softened, because, it, no, longer, contains, dissolved, calcium, ions, and, magnesium, ions, sodium, carbonate, has, several, uses, in, cuisine, largely, because, it, is, a, stronger, base, than, baking, soda, sodium, bicarbonate, but, weaker, than, lye, which, may, refer, to, sodium, hydroxide, or, less, commonly, potassium, hydroxide, alkalinity, affects, gluten, production, in, kneaded, doughs, and, also, improves, browning, by, reducing, the, temperature, at, which, the, maillard, reaction, occurs, to, take, advantage, of, the, former, effect, sodium, carbonate, is, therefore, one, of, the, components, of, kansui, a, solution, of, alkaline, salts, used, to, give, japanese, ramen, noodles, their, characteristic, flavour, and, chewy, texture, a, similar, solution, is, used, in, chinese, cuisine, to, make, lamian, for, similar, reasons, cantonese, bakers, similarly, use, sodium, carbonate, as, a, substitute, for, lye, water, to, give, moon, cakes, their, characteristic, texture, and, improve, browning, in, german, cuisine, and, central, european, cuisine, more, broadly, breads, such, as, pretzels, and, lye, rolls, traditionally, treated, with, lye, to, improve, browning, can, be, treated, instead, with, sodium, carbonate, sodium, carbonate, does, not, produce, quite, as, strong, a, browning, as, lye, but, is, much, safer, and, easier, to, work, with, sodium, carbonate, is, used, in, the, production, of, sherbet, powder, the, cooling, and, fizzing, sensation, results, from, the, endothermic, reaction, between, sodium, carbonate, and, a, weak, acid, commonly, citric, acid, releasing, carbon, dioxide, gas, which, occurs, when, the, sherbet, is, moistened, by, saliva, sodium, carbonate, also, finds, use, in, the, food, industry, as, a, food, additive, e500, as, an, acidity, regulator, anticaking, agent, raising, agent, and, stabilizer, it, is, also, used, in, the, production, of, snus, to, stabilize, the, ph, of, the, final, product, while, it, is, less, likely, to, cause, chemical, burns, than, lye, care, must, still, be, taken, when, working, with, sodium, carbonate, in, the, kitchen, as, it, is, corrosive, to, aluminum, cookware, utensils, and, foil, sodium, carbonate, is, also, used, as, a, relatively, strong, base, in, various, fields, as, a, common, alkali, it, is, preferred, in, many, chemical, processes, because, it, is, cheaper, than, sodium, hydroxide, and, far, safer, to, handle, its, mildness, especially, recommends, its, use, in, domestic, applications, for, example, it, is, used, as, a, ph, regulator, to, maintain, stable, alkaline, conditions, necessary, for, the, action, of, the, majority, of, photographic, film, developing, agents, it, is, also, a, common, additive, in, swimming, pools, and, aquarium, water, to, maintain, a, desired, ph, and, carbonate, hardness, kh, in, dyeing, with, fiber, reactive, dyes, sodium, carbonate, often, under, a, name, such, as, soda, ash, fixative, or, soda, ash, activator, is, used, to, ensure, proper, chemical, bonding, of, the, dye, with, cellulose, plant, fibers, typically, before, dyeing, for, tie, dyes, mixed, with, the, dye, for, dye, painting, or, after, dyeing, for, immersion, dyeing, it, is, also, used, in, the, froth, flotation, process, to, maintain, a, favourable, ph, as, a, float, conditioner, besides, cao, and, other, mildly, basic, compounds, sodium, bicarbonate, nahco, 3, or, baking, soda, also, a, component, in, fire, extinguishers, is, often, generated, from, sodium, carbonate, although, nahco, 3, is, itself, an, intermediate, product, of, the, solvay, process, the, heating, needed, to, remove, the, ammonia, that, contaminates, it, decomposes, some, nahco, 3, making, it, more, economical, to, react, finished, na, 2, co, 3, with, co, 2, in, a, related, reaction, sodium, carbonate, is, used, to, make, sodium, bisulfite, nahso, 3, which, is, used, for, the, sulfite, method, of, separating, lignin, from, cellulose, this, reaction, is, exploited, for, removing, sulfur, dioxide, from, flue, gases, in, power, stations, this, application, has, become, more, common, especially, where, stations, have, to, meet, stringent, emission, controls, sodium, carbonate, is, used, by, the, cotton, industry, to, neutralize, the, sulfuric, acid, needed, for, acid, delinting, of, fuzzy, cottonseed, it, is, also, used, to, form, carbonates, of, other, metals, by, ion, exchange, often, with, the, other, metals, sulphates, sodium, carbonate, is, used, by, the, brick, industry, as, a, wetting, agent, to, reduce, the, amount, of, water, needed, to, extrude, the, clay, in, casting, it, is, referred, to, as, bonding, agent, and, is, used, to, allow, wet, alginate, to, adhere, to, gelled, alginate, sodium, carbonate, is, used, in, toothpastes, where, it, acts, as, a, foaming, agent, and, an, abrasive, and, to, temporarily, increase, mouth, ph, sodium, carbonate, is, also, used, in, the, processing, and, tanning, of, animal, hides, the, integral, enthalpy, of, solution, of, sodium, carbonate, is, 28, 1, kj, mol, for, a, 10, w, w, aqueous, solution, the, mohs, hardness, of, sodium, carbonate, monohydrate, is, 1, 3, sodium, carbonate, is, soluble, in, water, and, can, occur, naturally, in, arid, regions, especially, in, mineral, deposits, evaporites, formed, when, seasonal, lakes, evaporate, deposits, of, the, mineral, natron, have, been, mined, from, dry, lake, bottoms, in, egypt, since, ancient, times, when, natron, was, used, in, the, preparation, of, mummies, and, in, the, early, manufacture, of, glass, the, anhydrous, mineral, form, of, sodium, carbonate, is, quite, rare, and, called, nitrite, sodium, carbonate, also, erupts, from, ol, doinyo, lengai, tanzania, s, unique, volcano, and, it, is, presumed, to, have, erupted, from, other, volcanoes, in, the, past, but, due, to, these, minerals, instability, at, the, earth, s, surface, are, likely, to, be, eroded, all, three, mineralogical, forms, of, sodium, carbonate, as, well, as, trona, trisodium, hydrogendi, carbonate, dihydrate, are, also, known, from, ultra, alkaline, pegmatitic, rocks, that, occur, for, example, in, the, kola, peninsula, in, russia, extra, terrestrially, known, sodium, carbonate, is, rare, deposits, have, been, identified, as, the, source, of, bright, spots, on, ceres, interior, material, that, has, been, brought, to, the, surface, while, there, are, carbonates, on, mars, and, these, are, expected, to, include, sodium, carbonate, deposits, have, yet, to, be, confirmed, this, absence, is, explained, by, some, as, being, due, to, a, global, dominance, of, low, ph, in, previously, aqueous, martian, soil, the, initial, large, scale, chemical, procedure, was, established, in, england, in, 1823, to, manufacture, soda, ash, trona, also, known, as, trisodium, hydrogendicarbonate, dihydrate, na, 3, hco, 3, co, 3, 2h, 2, o, is, mined, in, several, areas, of, the, us, and, provides, nearly, all, the, us, consumption, of, sodium, carbonate, large, natural, deposits, found, in, 1938, such, as, the, one, near, green, river, wyoming, have, made, mining, more, economical, than, industrial, production, in, north, america, there, are, important, reserves, of, trona, in, turkey, two, million, tons, of, soda, ash, have, been, extracted, from, the, reserves, near, ankara, several, halophyte, salt, tolerant, plant, species, and, seaweed, species, can, be, processed, to, yield, an, impure, form, of, sodium, carbonate, and, these, sources, predominated, in, europe, and, elsewhere, until, the, early, 19th, century, the, land, plants, typically, glassworts, or, saltworts, or, the, seaweed, typically, fucus, species, were, harvested, dried, and, burned, the, ashes, were, then, lixivated, washed, with, water, to, form, an, alkali, solution, this, solution, was, boiled, dry, to, create, the, final, product, which, was, termed, soda, ash, this, very, old, name, derives, from, the, arabic, word, soda, in, turn, applied, to, salsola, soda, one, of, the, many, species, of, seashore, plants, harvested, for, production, barilla, is, a, commercial, term, applied, to, an, impure, form, of, potash, obtained, from, coastal, plants, or, kelp, the, sodium, carbonate, concentration, in, soda, ash, varied, very, widely, from, 2, 3, percent, for, the, seaweed, derived, form, kelp, to, 30, percent, for, the, best, barilla, produced, from, saltwort, plants, in, spain, plant, and, seaweed, sources, for, soda, ash, and, also, for, the, related, alkali, potash, became, increasingly, inadequate, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, the, search, for, commercially, viable, routes, to, synthesizing, soda, ash, from, salt, and, other, chemicals, intensified, in, 1792, the, french, chemist, nicolas, leblanc, patented, a, process, for, producing, sodium, carbonate, from, salt, sulfuric, acid, limestone, and, coal, in, the, first, step, sodium, chloride, is, treated, with, sulfuric, acid, in, the, mannheim, process, this, reaction, produces, sodium, sulfate, salt, cake, and, hydrogen, chloride, the, salt, cake, and, crushed, limestone, calcium, carbonate, was, reduced, by, heating, with, coal, this, conversion, entails, two, parts, first, is, the, carbothermic, reaction, whereby, the, coal, a, source, of, carbon, reduces, the, sulfate, to, sulfide, the, second, stage, is, the, reaction, to, produce, sodium, carbonate, and, calcium, sulfide, this, mixture, is, called, black, ash, the, soda, ash, is, extracted, from, the, black, ash, with, water, evaporation, of, this, extract, yields, solid, sodium, carbonate, this, extraction, process, was, termed, lixiviating, the, hydrochloric, acid, produced, by, the, leblanc, process, was, a, major, source, of, air, pollution, and, the, calcium, sulfide, byproduct, also, presented, waste, disposal, issues, however, it, remained, the, major, production, method, for, sodium, carbonate, until, the, late, 1880s, in, 1861, the, belgian, industrial, chemist, ernest, solvay, developed, a, method, to, make, sodium, carbonate, by, first, reacting, sodium, chloride, ammonia, water, and, carbon, dioxide, to, generate, sodium, bicarbonate, and, ammonium, chloride, the, resulting, sodium, bicarbonate, was, then, converted, to, sodium, carbonate, by, heating, it, releasing, water, and, carbon, dioxide, meanwhile, the, ammonia, was, regenerated, from, the, ammonium, chloride, byproduct, by, treating, it, with, the, lime, calcium, oxide, left, over, from, carbon, dioxide, generation, the, solvay, process, recycles, its, ammonia, it, consumes, only, brine, and, limestone, and, calcium, chloride, is, its, only, waste, product, the, process, is, substantially, more, economical, than, the, leblanc, process, which, generates, two, waste, products, calcium, sulfide, and, hydrogen, chloride, the, solvay, process, quickly, came, to, dominate, sodium, carbonate, production, worldwide, by, 1900, 90, of, sodium, carbonate, was, produced, by, the, solvay, process, and, the, last, leblanc, process, plant, closed, in, the, early, 1920s, the, second, step, of, the, solvay, process, heating, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, on, a, small, scale, by, home, cooks, and, in, restaurants, to, make, sodium, carbonate, for, culinary, purposes, including, pretzels, and, alkali, noodles, the, method, is, appealing, to, such, users, because, sodium, bicarbonate, is, widely, sold, as, baking, soda, and, the, temperatures, required, 250, f, 121, c, to, 300, f, 149, c, to, convert, baking, soda, to, sodium, carbonate, are, readily, achieved, in, conventional, kitchen, ovens, this, process, was, developed, by, chinese, chemist, hou, debang, in, the, 1930s, the, earlier, steam, reforming, by, product, carbon, dioxide, was, pumped, through, a, saturated, solution, of, sodium, chloride, and, ammonia, to, produce, sodium, bicarbonate, by, these, reactions, the, sodium, bicarbonate, was, collected, as, a, precipitate, due, to, its, low, solubility, and, then, heated, up, to, approximately, 80, c, 176, f, or, 95, c, 203, f, to, yield, pure, sodium, carbonate, similar, to, last, step, of, the, solvay, process, more, sodium, chloride, is, added, to, the, remaining, solution, of, ammonium, and, sodium, chlorides, also, more, ammonia, is, pumped, at, 30, 40, c, to, this, solution, the, solution, temperature, is, then, lowered, to, below, 10, c, solubility, of, ammonium, chloride, is, higher, than, that, of, sodium, chloride, at, 30, c, and, lower, at, 10, c, due, to, this, temperature, dependent, solubility, difference, and, the, common, ion, effect, ammonium, chloride, is, precipitated, in, a, sodium, chloride, solution, the, chinese, name, of, hou, s, process, lianhe, zhijian, fa, means, coupled, manufacturing, alkali, method, hou, s, process, is, coupled, to, the, haber, process, and, offers, better, atom, economy, by, eliminating, the, production, of, calcium, chloride, since, ammonia, no, longer, needs, to, be, regenerated, the, by, product, ammonium, chloride, can, be, sold, as, a, fertilizer
